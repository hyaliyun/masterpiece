<p>&quot;THE ROSE OF DIXIE&quot;</p>
<p>When The Rose of Dixie magazine was started by a stock company in  Toombs City, Georgia, there was never but one candidate for its chief  editorial position in the minds of its owners.  Col.  Aquila Telfair  was the man for the place.  By all the rights of learning, family,  reputation, and Southern traditions, he was its foreordained, fit, and  logical editor.  So, a committee of the patriotic Georgia citizens who  had subscribed the founding fund of $100,000 called upon Colonel  Telfair at his residence, Cedar Heights, fearful lest the enterprise  and the South should suffer by his possible refusal.</p>
<p>The colonel received them in his great library, where he spent most of  his days.  The library had descended to him from his father.  It  contained ten thousand volumes, some of which had been published as  late as the year 1861.  When the deputation arrived, Colonel Telfair  was seated at his massive white-pine centre-table, reading Burton&#x27;s  Anatomy of Melancholy.  He arose and shook hands punctiliously with  each member of the committee.  If you were familiar with The Rose of  Dixie you will remember the colonel&#x27;s portrait, which appeared in it  from time to time.  You could not forget the long, carefully brushed  white hair; the hooked, high-bridged nose, slightly twisted to the  left; the keen eyes under the still black eyebrows; the classic mouth  beneath the drooping white mustache, slightly frazzled at the ends.</p>
<p>The committee solicitously offered him the position of managing  editor, humbly presenting an outline of the field that the publication  was designed to cover and mentioning a comfortable salary.  The  colonel&#x27;s lands were growing poorer each year and were much cut up by  red gullies.  Besides, the honor was not one to be refused.</p>
<p>In a forty-minute speech of acceptance, Colonel Telfair gave an  outline of English literature from Chaucer to Macaulay, re-fought the  battle of Chancellorsville, and said that, God helping him, he would  so conduct The Rose of Dixie that its fragrance and beauty would  permeate the entire world, hurling back into the teeth of the Northern  minions their belief that no genius or good could exist in the brains  and hearts of the people whose property they had destroyed and whose  rights they had curtailed.</p>
<p>Offices for the magazine were partitioned off and furnished in the  second floor of the First National Bank building; and it was for the  colonel to cause The Rose of Dixie to blossom and flourish or to wilt  in the balmy air of the land of flowers.</p>
<p>The staff of assistants and contributors that Editor-Colonel Telfair  drew about him was a peach.  It was a whole crate of Georgia peaches.   The first assistant editor, Tolliver Lee Fairfax, had had a father  killed during Pickett&#x27;s charge.  The second assistant, Keats Unthank,  was the nephew of one of Morgan&#x27;s Raiders.  The book reviewer, Jackson  Rockingham, had been the youngest soldier in the Confederate army,  having appeared on the field of battle with a sword in one hand and a  milk-bottle in the other.  The art editor, Roncesvalles Sykes, was a  third cousin to a nephew of Jefferson Davis.  Miss Lavinia Terhune,  the colonel&#x27;s stenographer and typewriter, had an aunt who had once  been kissed by Stonewall Jackson.  Tommy Webster, the head office-boy,  got his job by having recited Father Ryan&#x27;s poems, complete, at the  commencement exercises of the Toombs City High School.  The girls who  wrapped and addressed the magazines were members of old Southern  families in Reduced Circumstances.  The cashier was a scrub named  Hawkins, from Ann Arbor, Michigan, who had recommendations and a bond  from a guarantee company filed with the owners.  Even Georgia stock  companies sometimes realize that it takes live ones to bury the dead.</p>
<p>Well, sir, if you believe me, The Rose of Dixie blossomed five times  before anybody heard of it except the people who buy their hooks and  eyes in Toombs City.  Then Hawkins climbed off his stool and told on  &#x27;em to the stock company.  Even in Ann Arbor he had been used to  having his business propositions heard of at least as far away as  Detroit.  So an advertising manager was engaged -- Beauregard Fitzhugh  Banks, a young man in a lavender necktie, whose grandfather had been  the Exalted High Pillow-slip of the Kuklux Klan.</p>
<p>In spite of which The Rose of Dixie kept coming out every month.   Although in every issue it ran photos of either the Taj Mahal or the  Luxembourg Gardens, or Carmencita or La Follette, a certain number of  people bought it and subscribed for it.  As a boom for it, Editor- Colonel Telfair ran three different views of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s old  home, &quot;The Hermitage,&quot; a full-page engraving of the second battle of  Manassas, entitled &quot;Lee to the Rear!&quot; and a five-thousand-word  biography of Belle Boyd in the same number.  The subscription list  that month advanced 118.  Also there were poems in the same issue by  Leonina Vashti Haricot (pen-name), related to the Haricots of  Charleston, South Carolina, and Bill Thompson, nephew of one of the  stockholders.  And an article from a special society correspondent  describing a tea-party given by the swell Boston and English set,  where a lot of tea was spilled overboard by some of the guests  masquerading as Indians.</p>
<p>One day a person whose breath would easily cloud a mirror, he was so  much alive, entered the office of The Rose of Dixie.  He was a man  about the size of a real-estate agent, with a self-tied tie and a  manner that he must have borrowed conjointly from W J.  Bryan,  Hackenschmidt, and Hetty Green.  He was shown into the editor- colonel&#x27;s pons asinorum.  Colonel Telfair rose and began a Prince  Albert bow.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m Thacker,&quot; said the intruder, taking the editor&#x27;s chair--&quot;T. T.  Thacker, of New York.&quot;</p>
<p>He dribbled hastily upon the colonel&#x27;s desk some cards, a bulky manila  envelope, and a letter from the owners of The Rose of Dixie.  This  letter introduced Mr. Thacker, and politely requested Colonel Telfair  to give him a conference and whatever information about the magazine  he might desire.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve been corresponding with the secretary of the magazine owners for  some time,&quot; said Thacker, briskly.  &quot;I&#x27;m a practical magazine man  myself, and a circulation booster as good as any, if I do say it.   I&#x27;ll guarantee an increase of anywhere from ten thousand to a hundred  thousand a year for any publication that isn&#x27;t printed in a dead  language.  I&#x27;ve had my eye on The Rose of Dixie ever since it started.   I know every end of the business from editing to setting up the  classified ads.  Now, I&#x27;ve come down here to put a good bunch of money  in the magazine, if I can see my way clear.  It ought to be made to  pay.  The secretary tells me it&#x27;s losing money.  I don&#x27;t see why a  magazine in the South, if it&#x27;s properly handled, shouldn&#x27;t get a  good circulation in the North, too.</p>
<p>&quot;Colonel Telfair leaned back in his chair and polished his gold-rimmed  glasses.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Thacker,&quot; said he, courteously but firmly, &quot;The Rose of Dixie is  a publication devoted to the fostering and the voicing of Southern  genius.  Its watchword, which you may have seen on the cover, is &#x27;Of,  For, and By the South.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you wouldn&#x27;t object to a Northern circulation, would you?&quot; asked  Thacker.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; said the editor-colonel, &quot;that it is customary to open  the circulation lists to all.  I do not know.  I have nothing to do  with the business affairs of the magazine.  I was called upon to  assume editorial control of it, and I have devoted to its conduct such  poor literary talents as I may possess and whatever store of erudition  I may have acquired.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Thacker.  &quot;But a dollar is a dollar anywhere, North,  South, or West--whether you&#x27;re buying codfish, goober peas, or Rocky  Ford cantaloupes.  Now, I&#x27;ve been looking over your November number.   I see one here on your desk.  You don&#x27;t mind running over it with me?</p>
<p>&quot;Well, your leading article is all right.  A good write-up of the  cotton-belt with plenty of photographs is a winner any time.  New York  is always interested in the cotton crop.  And this sensational account  of Hatfield-McCoy feud, by a schoolmate of a niece of the Governor of  Kentucky, isn&#x27;t such a bad idea.  It happened so long ago that most  people have forgotten it.  Now, here&#x27;s a poem three pages long called  &#x27;The Tyrant&#x27;s Foot,&#x27; by Lorella Lascelles.  I&#x27;ve pawed around a good  deal over manuscripts, but I never saw her name on a rejection slip.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Lascelles,&quot; said the editor, &quot;is one of our most widely  recognized Southern poetesses.  She is closely related to the Alabama  Lascelles family, and made with her own hands the silken Confederate  banner that was presented to the governor of that state at his  inauguration.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why,&quot; persisted Thacker, &quot;is the poem illustrated with a view of  the M.  &amp; 0.  Railroad freight depot at Tuscaloosa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The illustration,&quot; said the colonel, with dignity, &quot;shows a corner of  the fence surrounding the old homestead where Miss Lascelles was  born.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Thacker.  &quot;I read the poem, but I couldn&#x27;t tell   whether it was about the depot of the battle of Bull Run.  Now, here&#x27;s  a short story called &#x27;Rosies&#x27; Temptation,&#x27; by Fosdyke Piggott.  It&#x27;s  rotten.  What is a Piggott, anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr.  Piggott,&quot; said the editor, &quot;is a brother of the principal  stockholder of the magazine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All&#x27;s right with the world--Piggott passes,&quot; said Thacker.  &quot;Well   this article on Arctic exploration and the one on tarpon fishing might  go.  But how about this write-up of the Atlanta, New Orleans,  Nashville, and Savannah breweries?  It seems to consist mainly of  statistics about their output and the quality of their beer.  What&#x27;s  the chip over the bug?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I understand your figurative language,&quot; answered Colonel Telfair,  &quot;it is this: the article you refer to was handed to me by the owners  of the magazine with instructions to publish it.  The literary quality  of it did not appeal to me.  But, in a measure, I feel impelled to  conform, in certain matters, to the wishes of the gentlemen who are  interested in the financial side of The Rose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; said Thacker.  &quot;Next we have two pages of selections from  &#x27;Lalla Rookh,&#x27; by Thomas Moore.  Now, what Federal prison did Moore  escape from, or what&#x27;s the name of the F.  F.  V.  family that he  carries as a handicap?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Moore was an Irish poet who died in 1852,&quot; said Colonel Telfair,  pityingly.  &quot;He is a classic.  I have been thinking of reprinting his  translation of Anacreon serially in the magazine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look out for the copyright laws,&quot;  said Thacker, flippantly.   Who&#x27;s  Bessie Belleclair, who contributes the essay on the newly completed  water-works plant in Milledgeville?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The name, sir,&quot; said Colonel Telfair, &quot;is the nom de guerre of Miss  Elvira Simpkins.  I have not the honor of knowing the lady; but her  contribution was sent to us by Congressman Brower, of her native  state.  Congressman Brower&#x27;s mother was related to the Polks of  Tennessee.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, see here, Colonel,&quot; said Thacker, throwing down the magazine,  &quot;this won&#x27;t do.  You can&#x27;t successfully run a magazine for one  particular section of the country.  You&#x27;ve got to make a universal  appeal.  Look how the Northern publications have catered to the South  and encouraged the Southern writers.  And you&#x27;ve got to go far and  wide for your contributors.  You&#x27;ve got to buy stuff according to its  quality without any regard to the pedigree of the author.  Now, I&#x27;ll  bet a quart of ink that this Southern parlor organ you&#x27;ve been running  has never played a note that originated about Mason &amp; Hamlin&#x27;s line.   Am I right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have carefully and conscientiously rejected all contributions from  that section of the country--if I understand your figurative language  aright,&quot; replied the colonel.</p>
<p>&quot;All right.  Now I&#x27;ll show you something.&quot;</p>
<p>Thacker reached for his thick manila envelope and dumped a mass of  typewritten manuscript on the editors desk.</p>
<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s some truck,&quot; said he, &quot;that I paid cash for, and brought along  with me.&quot;</p>
<p>One by one he folded back the manuscripts and showed their first pages  to the colonel.</p>
<p>Here are four short stories four of the highest priced authors in the  United States--three of &#x27;em living in New York, and one commuting.   There&#x27;s a special article on Vienna-bred society by Tom Vampson.   Here&#x27;s an Italian serial by Captain Jack--no--it&#x27;s the other Crawford.   Here are three separate exposes of city governments by Sniffings, and  here&#x27;s a dandy entitled &#x27;What Women Carry in Dress-Suit Cases&#x27;--a  Chicago newspaper woman hired herself out for five years as a lady&#x27;s  maid to get that information.  And here&#x27;s a Synopsis of Preceding  Chapters of Hall Caine&#x27;s new serial to appear next June.  And here&#x27;s a  couple of pounds of vers de societe that I got at a rate from the  clever magazines.  That&#x27;s the stuff that people everywhere want.  And  now here&#x27;s a writeup with photographs at the ages of four, twelve,  twenty-two, and thirty of George B.  McClellan.  It&#x27;s a  prognostication.  He&#x27;s bound to be elected Mayor of New York.  It &#x27;11  make a big hit all over the country.  He--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; said Colonel Telfair, stiffening in his chair.   &quot;What was the name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; said Thacker, with half a grin.  Yes, he&#x27;s a son of the  General.  We&#x27;ll pass that manuscript up.  But, if you&#x27;ll excuse me,  Colonel, it&#x27;s a magazine we&#x27;re trying to make go off--not the first  gun at Fort Sumter.  Now, here&#x27;s a thing that&#x27;s bound to get next to  you.  It&#x27;s an original poem by James Whitcomb Riley.  J.W.  himself.   You know what that means to a magazine.  I won&#x27;t tell you what I had  to pay for that poem; but I&#x27;ll tell you this--Riley can make more  money writing with a fountain-pen than you or I can with one that lets  the ink run.  I&#x27;ll read you the last two stanzas:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Pa lays around &#x27;n&#x27; loafs all day,    &#x27;N&#x27; reads and makes us leave him be. He lets me do just like I please,    &#x27;N&#x27; when I&#x27;m in bad he laughs at me, &#x27;N&#x27; when I holler loud &#x27;n&#x27; say    Bad words &#x27;n&#x27; then begin to tease The cat, &#x27;n&#x27; pa just smiles, ma&#x27;s mad    &#x27;N&#x27; gives me Jesse crost her knees.       I always wondered why that wuz-       I guess it&#x27;s cause            Pa never does.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;&#x27;N&#x27; after all the lights are out    I&#x27;m sorry &#x27;bout it; so I creep Out of my trundle bed to ma&#x27;s    &#x27;N&#x27; say I love her a whole heap, &#x27;N&#x27; kiss her, &#x27;n&#x27; I hug her tight.    &#x27;N&#x27; it&#x27;s too dark to see her eyes, But every time I do I know    She cries &#x27;n&#x27; cries &#x27;n&#x27; cries &#x27;n&#x27; cries.       I always wondered why that wuz-       I guess it&#x27;s &#x27;cause          Pa never does.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the stuff,&quot; continued Thacker.  &quot;What do you think of that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not unfamiliar with the works of Mr.  Riley,&quot; said the colonel,  deliberately.  &quot;I believe he lives in Indiana.  For the last ten years  I have been somewhat of a literary recluse, and am familiar with  nearly all the books in the Cedar Heights library.  I am also of the  opinion that a magazine should contain a certain amount of poetry.   Many of the sweetest singers of the South have already contributed to  the pages of The Rose of Dixie.  I, myself, have thought of  translating from the original for publication in its pages the works  of the great Italian poet Tasso.  Have you ever drunk from the  fountain of this immortal poet&#x27;s lines, Mr.  Thacker?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not even a demi-Tasso,&quot; said Thacker.</p>
<p>Now, let&#x27;s come to the point, Colonel Telfair.  I&#x27;ve already invested  some money in this as a flyer.  That bunch of manuscripts cost me  $4,000.  My object was to try a number of them in the next issue-I  believe you make up less than a month ahead--and see what effect it  has on the circulation.  I believe that by printing the best stuff we  can get in the North, South, East, or West we can make the magazine  go.  You have there the letter from the owning company asking you to  co-operate with me in the plan.  Let&#x27;s chuck out some of this slush  that you&#x27;ve been publishing just because the writers are related to  the Skoopdoodles of Skoopdoodle County.  Are you with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As long as I continue to be the editor of The Rose,&quot; said Colonel  Telfair, with dignity, &quot;I shall be its editor.  But I desire also to  conform to the wishes of its owners if I can do so conscientiously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the talk,&quot; said Thacker, briskly.  &quot;Now, how much of this  stuff I&#x27;ve brought can we get into the January number?  We want to  begin right away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is yet space in the January number,&quot; said the editor, &quot;for  about eight thousand words, roughly estimated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great!&quot; said Thacker.  &quot;It isn&#x27;t much, but it&#x27;ll give the readers  some change from goobers, governors, and Gettysburg.  I&#x27;ll leave the  selection of the stuff I brought to fill the space to you, as it&#x27;s all  good.  I&#x27;ve got to run back to New York, and I&#x27;ll be down again in a  couple of weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>Colonel Telfair slowly swung his eye-glasses by their broad, black  ribbon.</p>
<p>&quot;The space in the January number that I referred to,&quot; said he,  measuredly, &quot;has been held open purposely, pending a decision that I  have not yet made.  A short time ago a contribution was submitted to  The Rose of Dixie that is one of the most remarkable literary efforts  that has ever come under my observation.  None but a master mind and  talent could have produced it.  It would just fill the space that I  have reserved for its possible use.&quot;</p>
<p>Thacker looked anxious.</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of stuff is it?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Eight thousand words sounds  suspicious.  The oldest families must have been collaborating.  Is  there going to be another secession ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The author of the article,&quot; continued the colonel, ignoring Thacker&#x27;s  allusions, &quot;is a writer of some reputation.  He has also distinguished  himself in other ways.  I do not feel at liberty to reveal to you his  name--at least not until I have decided whether or not to accept his  contribution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Thacker, nervously, &quot;is it a continued story, or an  account of the unveiling of the new town pump in Whitmire, South  Carolina, or a revised list of General Lee&#x27;s body-servants, or what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are disposed to be facetious,&quot; said Colonel Telfair, calmly.   &quot;The article is from the pen of a thinker, a philosopher, a lover of  mankind, a student, and a rhetorician of high degree.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must have been written by a syndicate,&quot; said Thacker.  &quot;But,  honestly, Colonel, you want to go slow.  I don&#x27;t know of any eight- thousand-word single doses of written matter that are read by anybody  these days, except Supreme Court briefs and reports of murder trials.   You haven&#x27;t by any accident gotten hold of a copy of one of Daniel  Webster&#x27;s speeches, have you?&quot;</p>
<p>Colonel Telfair swung a little in his chair and looked steadily from  under his bushy eyebrows at the magazine promoter.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr.  Thacker,&quot; he said, gravely, &quot;I am willing to segregate the  somewhat crude expression of your sense of humor from the solicitude  that your business investments undoubtedly have conferred upon you.   But I must ask you to cease your jibes and derogatory comments upon  the South and the Southern people.  They, sir, will not be tolerated  in the office of The Rose of Dixie for one moment.  And before you  proceed with more of your covert insinuations that I, the editor of  this magazine, am not a competent judge of the merits of the matter  submitted to its consideration, I beg that you will first present some  evidence or proof that you are my superior in any way, shape, or form  relative to the question in hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, come, Colonel,&quot; said Thacker, good-naturedly.  &quot;I didn&#x27;t do  anything like that to you.  It sounds like an indictment by the fourth  assistant attorney-general.  Let&#x27;s get back to business.  What&#x27;s this  8,000 to 1 shot about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The article,&quot; said Colonel Telfair, acknowledging the apology by a  slight bow, &quot;covers a wide area of knowledge.  It takes up theories  and questions that have puzzled the world for centuries, and disposes  of them logically and concisely.  One by one it holds up to view the  evils of the world, points out the way of eradicating them; and then  conscientiously and in detail comments the good.  There is hardly a  phase of human life that it does not discuss wisely, calmly, and  equitably.  The great policies of governments, the duties of private  citizens, the obligations of home life, law, ethics, morality--all  these important subjects are handled with a calm wisdom and confidence  that I must confess has captured my admiration.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must be a crackerjack,&quot; said Thacker, impressed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a great contribution to the world&#x27;s wisdom,&quot; said the colonel.   &quot;The only doubt remaining in my mind as to the tremendous advantage it  would be to us to give it publication in The Rose of Dixie is that I  have not yet sufficient information about the author to give his work  publicity in our magazine.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought you said he is a distinguished man,&quot; said Thacker.</p>
<p>&quot;He is,&quot; replied the colonel, &quot;both in literary and in other more  diversified and extraneous fields.  But I am extremely careful about  the matter that I accept for publication.  My contributors are people  of unquestionable repute and connections, which fact can be verified  at any time.  As I said, I am holding this article until I can acquire  more information about its author.  I do not know whether I will  publish it or not.  If I decide against it, I shall be much pleased,  Mr.  Thacker, to substitute the matter that you are leaving with me in  its place.&quot;</p>
<p>Thacker was somewhat at sea.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t seem to gather,&quot; said he, &quot;much about the gist of this  inspired piece of literature.  It sounds more like a dark horse than  Pegasus to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a human document,&quot; said the colonel-editor, confidently, &quot;from  a man of great accomplishments who, in my opinion, has obtained a  stronger grasp on the world and its outcomes than that of any man  living to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>Thacker rose to his feet excitedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Say!&quot; he said.  &quot;It isn&#x27;t possible that you&#x27;ve cornered John D.   Rockefeller&#x27;s memoirs, is it?  Don&#x27;t tell me that all at once.&quot;</p>
<p>No, sir,&quot; said Colonel Telfair.  &quot;I am speaking of mentality and  literature not of the less worthy intricacies of trade.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, what&#x27;s the trouble about running the article,&quot; asked Thacker, a  little impatiently, &quot;if the man&#x27;s well known and has got the stuff ?&quot; Colonel Telfair sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr.  Thacker,&quot; said he, &quot;for once I have been tempted.  Nothing has  yet appeared in The Rose of Dixie that has not been from the pen of  one of its sons or daughters.  I know little about the author of this  article except that he has acquired prominence in a section of the  country that has always been inimical to my heart and mind.  But I  recognize his genius; and, as I have told you, I have instituted an  investigation of his personality.  Perhaps it will be futile.  But I  shall pursue the inquiry.  Until that is finished, I must leave open  the question of filling the vacant space in our January number.&quot;</p>
<p>Thacker arose to leave.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, Colonel,&quot; he said, as cordially as he could.  &quot;You use  your own judgment.  If you&#x27;ve really got a scoop or something that  will make &#x27;em sit up, run it instead of my stuff.  I&#x27;ll drop in again  in about two weeks.  Good luck!&quot;</p>
<p>Colonel Telfair and the magazine promoter shook hands.</p>
<p>Returning a fortnight later, Thacker dropped off a very rocky Pullman  at Toombs City.  He found the January number of the magazine made up  and the forms closed.</p>
<p>The vacant space that had been yawning for type was filled by an  article that was headed thus:</p>

<p>THE THIRD INGREDIENT</p>
<p>The (so-called) Vallambrosa Apartment-House is not an apartment-house.   It is composed of two old-fashioned, brownstone-front residences  welded into one.  The parlor floor of one side is gay with the wraps  and head-gear of a modiste; the other is lugubrious with the  sophistical promises and grisly display of a painless dentist.  You  may have a room there for two dollars a week or you may have one for  twenty dollars.  Among the Vallambrosa&#x27;s roomers are stenographers,  musicians, brokers, shop-girls, space-rate writers, art students,  wire-tappers, and other people who lean far over the banister-rail  when the door-bell rings.</p>
<p>This treatise shall have to do with but two of the Vallambrosians-- though meaning no disrespect to the others.</p>
<p>At six o&#x27;clock one afternoon Hetty Pepper came back to her third-floor  rear $3.50 room in the Vallambrosa with her nose and chin more sharply  pointed than usual.  To be discharged from the department store where  you have been working four years, and with only fifteen cents in your  purse, does have a tendency to make your features appear more finely  chiseled.</p>
<p>And now for Hetty&#x27;s thumb-nail biography while she climbs the two  flights of stairs.</p>
<p>She walked into the Biggest Store one morning four years before with  seventy-five other girls, applying for a job behind the waist  department counter.  The phalanx of wage-earners formed a bewildering  scene of beauty, carrying a total mass of blond hair sufficient to  have justified the horseback gallops of a hundred Lady Godivas.</p>
<p>The capable, cool-eyed, impersonal, young, bald-headed man whose task  it was to engage six of the contestants, was aware of a feeling of  suffocation as if he were drowning in a sea of frangipanni, while  white clouds, hand-embroidered, floated about him.  And then a sail  hove in sight.  Hetty Pepper, homely of countenance, with small,  contemptuous, green eyes and chocolate-colored hair, dressed in a suit  of plain burlap and a common-sense hat, stood before him with every  one of her twenty-nine years of life unmistakably in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re on!.&quot; shouted the bald-headed young man, and was saved.  And  that is how Hetty came to be employed in the Biggest Store.  The story  of her rise to an eight-dollar-a-week salary is the combined stories  of Hercules, Joan of Arc, Una, Job, and Little-Red-Riding-Hood.  You  shall not learn from me the salary that was paid her as a beginner.   There is a sentiment growing about such things, and I want no  millionaire store-proprietors climbing the fire-escape of my tenement- house to throw dynamite bombs into my skylight boudoir.</p>
<p>The story of Hetty&#x27;s discharge from the Biggest Store is so nearly a  repetition of her engagement as to be monotonous.</p>
<p>In each department of the store there is an omniscient, omnipresent,  and omnivorous person carrying always a mileage book and a red  necktie, and referred to as a &quot;buyer.&quot;  The destinies of the girls in  his department who live on (see Bureau of Victual Statistics)--so much  per week are in his hands.</p>
<p>This particular buyer was a capable, cool-eyed, impersonal, young,  bald-headed man.  As he walked along the aisles of his department lie  seemed to be sailing on a sea of frangipanni, while white clouds,  machine-embroidered, floated around him.  Too many sweets bring  surfeit.  He looked upon Hetty Pepper&#x27;s homely countenance, emerald  eyes, and chocolate-colored hair as a welcome oasis of green in a  desert of cloying beauty.  In a quiet angle of a counter he pinched  her arm kindly, three inches above the elbow.  She slapped him three  feet away with one good blow of her muscular and not especially lily- white right.  So, now you know why Hetty Pepper came to leave the  Biggest Store at thirty minutes&#x27; notice, with one dime and a nickel in  her purse.</p>
<p>This morning&#x27;s quotations list the price of rib beef at six cents per  (butcher&#x27;s) pound.  But on the day that Hetty was &quot;released&quot; by the B.   S.  the price was seven and one-half cents.  That fact is what makes  this story possible.  Otherwise, the extra  four cents would have--</p>
<p>But the plot of nearly all the good stories in the world is concerned  with shorts who were unable to cover; so you can find no fault with  this one.</p>
<p>Hetty mounted with her rib beef to her $3.50 third-floor back.  One  hot, savory beef-stew for supper, a night&#x27;s good sleep, and she would  be fit in the morning to apply again for the tasks of Hercules, Joan  of Arc, Una, Job, and Little-Red-Riding-Hood.</p>
<p>In her room she got the granite-ware stew-pan out of the 2x4-foot  china--er--I mean earthenware closet, and began to dig down in a  rats&#x27;-nest of paper bags for the potatoes and onions.  She came out  with her nose and chin just a little sharper pointed.</p>
<p>There was neither a potato nor an onion.  Now, what kind of a beef- Stew can you make out of simply beef?  You can make oyster-soup  without oysters, turtle-soup without turtles, coffee-cake without  coffee, but you can&#x27;t make beef-stew without potatoes and onions.</p>
<p>But rib beef alone, in an emergency, can make an ordinary pine door  look like a wrought-iron gambling-house portal to the wolf.  With salt  and pepper and a tablespoonful of flour (first well stirred in a  little cold water) &#x27;twill serve--&#x27;tis not so deep as a lobster a la  Newburg nor so wide as a church festival doughnut; but &#x27;twill serve.</p>
<p>Hetty took her stew-pan to the rear of the third-floor hall.   According to the advertisements of the Vallambrosa there was running  water to be found there.  Between you and me and the water-meter, it  only ambled or walked through the faucets; but technicalities have no  place here.  There was also a sink where housekeeping roomers often  met to dump their coffee grounds and glare at one another&#x27;s kimonos.</p>
<p>At this sink Hetty found a girl with heavy, gold-brown, artistic hair  and plaintive eyes, washing two large &quot;Irish&quot; potatoes.  Hetty knew  the Vallambrosa as well as any one not owning &quot;double hextra- magnifying eyes&quot; could compass its mysteries.  The kimonos were her  encyclopedia, her &quot;Who&#x27;s What?&quot; her clearinghouse of news, of goers  and comers.  From a rose-pink kimono edged with Nile green she had  learned that the girl with the potatoes was a miniature-painter living  in a kind of attic--or &quot;studio,&quot; as they prefer to call it--on the top  floor.  Hetty was not certain in her mind what a miniature was; but it  certainly wasn&#x27;t a house; because house-painters, although they wear  splashy overalls and poke ladders in your face on the street, are  known to indulge in a riotous profusion of food at home.</p>
<p>The potato girl was quite slim and small, and handled her potatoes as  an old bachelor uncle handles a baby who is cutting teeth.  She had a  dull shoemaker&#x27;s knife in her right hand, and she had begun to peel  one of the potatoes with it.</p>
<p>Hetty addressed her in the punctiliously formal tone of one who  intends to be cheerfully familiar with you in the second round.</p>
<p>&quot;Beg pardon,&quot; she said, &quot;for butting into what&#x27;s not my business, but  if you peel them potatoes you lose out.  They&#x27;re new Bermudas.  You  want to scrape &#x27;em.  Lemme show you.&quot;</p>
<p>She took a potato and the knife, and began to demonstrate.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; breathed the artist.  &quot;I didn&#x27;t know.  And I did hate  to see the thick peeling go; it seemed such a waste.  But I thought  they always had to be peeled.  When you&#x27;ve got only potatoes to eat,  the peelings count, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say, kid,&quot; said Hetty, staying her knife, &quot;you ain&#x27;t up against it,  too, are you?&quot;</p>
<p>The miniature artist smiled starvedly.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose I am.  Art--or, at least, the way I interpret it--doesn&#x27;t  seem to be much in demand.  I have only these potatoes for my dinner.   But they aren&#x27;t so bad boiled and hot, with a little butter and salt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Child,&quot; said Hetty, letting a brief smile soften her rigid features,  &quot;Fate has sent me and you together.  I&#x27;ve had it handed to me in the  neck, too; but I&#x27;ve got a chunk of meat in my, room as big as a lap-dog. And I&#x27;ve done everything to get potatoes  except pray for &#x27;em.   Let&#x27;s me and you bunch our commissary  departments and make a stew of &#x27;em. We&#x27;ll cook it in my room.  If we  only had an onion to go in it!   Say, kid, you haven&#x27;t got a couple of pennies that&#x27;ve slipped down  into the lining of your last winter&#x27;s sealskin, have you?   I could step down to the corner and get one at old Giuseppe&#x27;s stand. A stew without an onion is worse&#x27;n a matinee without candy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may call me Cecilia,&quot; said the artist.  &quot;No; I spent my last  penny three days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then we&#x27;ll have to cut the onion out instead of slicing it in,&quot; said  Hetty.  &quot;I&#x27;d ask the janitress for one, but I don&#x27;t want &#x27;em hep just  yet to the fact that I&#x27;m pounding the asphalt for another job.  But I  wish we did have an onion.&quot;</p>
<p>In the shop-girl&#x27;s room the two began to prepare their supper.   Cecilia&#x27;s part was to sit on the couch helplessly and beg to be  allowed to do something, in the voice of a cooing ring-dove.  Hetty  prepared the rib beef, putting it in cold salted water in the stew-pan  and setting it on the one-burner gas-stove.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish we had an onion,&quot; said Hetty, as she scraped the two potatoes.</p>
<p>On the wall opposite the couch was pinned a flaming, gorgeous  advertising picture of one of the new ferry-boats of the P.  U.  F.   F.  Railroad that had been built to cut down the time between Los  Angeles and New York City one-eighth of a minute.</p>
<p>Hetty, turning her head during her continuous monologue, saw tears  running from her guest&#x27;s eyes as she gazed on the idealized  presentment of the speeding, foam-girdled transport.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, say, Cecilia, kid,&quot; said Hetty, poising her knife, &quot;is it as bad  art as that?  I ain&#x27;t a critic; but I thought it kind of brightened up  the room.  Of course, a manicure-painter could tell it was a bum  picture in a minute.  I&#x27;ll take it down if you say so.  I wish to the  holy Saint Potluck we had an onion.&quot;</p>
<p>But the miniature miniature-painter had tumbled down, sobbing, with  her nose indenting the hard-woven drapery of the couch.  Something was  here deeper than the artistic temperament offended at crude  lithography.</p>
<p>Hetty knew.  She had accepted her role long ago.  How scant the words  with which we try to describe a single quality of a human being! When  we reach the abstract we are lost.  The nearer to Nature that the  babbling of our lips comes, the better do we understand.  Figuratively  (let us say), some people are Bosoms, some are Hands, some are Heads,  some are Muscles, some are Feet, some are Backs for burdens.</p>
<p>Hetty was a Shoulder.  Hers was a sharp, sinewy shoulder; but all her  life people had laid their heads upon it, metaphorically or actually,  and had left there all or half their troubles.  Looking at Life  anatomically, which is as good a way as any, she was preordained to be  a Shoulder.  There were few truer collar-bones anywhere than hers.</p>
<p>Hetty was only thirty-three, and she had not yet outlived the little  pang that visited her whenever the head of youth and beauty leaned  upon her for consolation.  But one glance in her mirror always served  as an instantaneous pain-killer.  So she gave one pale look into the  crinkly old looking-glass on the wall above the gas-stove, turned down  the flame a little lower from the bubbling beef and potatoes, went  over to the couch, and lifted Cecilia&#x27;s head to its confessional.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on and tell me, honey,&quot; she said.  &quot;I know now that it ain&#x27;t art  that&#x27;s worrying you.  You met him on a ferry-boat, didn&#x27;t you? Go on,  Cecilia, kid, and tell your--your Aunt Hetty about it.&quot;</p>
<p>But youth and melancholy must first spend the surplus of sighs and  tears that waft and float the barque of romance to its harbor in the  delectable isles.  Presently, through the stringy tendons that formed  the bars of the confessional, the penitent--or was it the glorified  communicant of the sacred flame--told her story without art or  illumination.</p>
<p>&quot;It was only three days ago.  I was coming back on the ferry from  Jersey City.  Old Mr.  Schrum, an art dealer, told me of a rich man in  Newark who wanted a miniature of his daughter painted.  I went to see  him and showed him some of my work.  When I told him the price would  be fifty dollars he laughed at me like a hyena.  He said an enlarged  crayon twenty times the size would cost him only eight dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;I had just enough money to buy my ferry ticket back to New York.  I  felt as if I didn&#x27;t want to live another day.  I must have looked as I  felt, for I saw him on the row of seats opposite me, looking at me as  if he understood.  He was nice-looking, but oh, above everything else,  he looked kind.  When one is tired or unhappy or hopeless, kindness  counts more than anything else.</p>
<p>&quot;When I got so miserable that I couldn&#x27;t fight against it any longer,  I got up and walked slowly out the rear door of the ferry-boat cabin.   No one was there, and I slipped quickly over the rail and dropped into  the water.  Oh, friend Hetty, it was cold, cold!</p>
<p>&quot;For just one moment I wished I was back in the old Vallambrosa,  starving and hoping.  And then I got numb, and didn&#x27;t care.  And then  I felt that somebody else was in the water close by me, holding me up.   He had followed me, and jumped in to save me.</p>
<p>&quot;Somebody threw a thing like a big, white doughnut at us, and he made  me put my arms through the hole.  Then the ferry-boat backed, and they  pulled us on board.  Oh, Hetty, I was so ashamed of my wickedness in  trying to drown myself; and, besides, my hair had all tumbled down and  was sopping wet, and I was such a sight.</p>
<p>&quot;And then some men in blue clothes came around; and he gave them his  card, and I heard him tell them he had seen me drop my purse on the  edge of the boat outside the rail, and in leaning over to get it I had  fallen overboard.</p>
<p>And then I remembered having read in the papers that people who try to  kill themselves are locked up in cells with people who try to kill  other people, and I was afraid.</p>
<p>&quot;But some ladies on the boat took me downstairs to the furnace-room  and got me nearly dry and did up my hair.  When the boat landed, he  came and put me in a cab.  He was all dripping himself, but laughed as  if he thought it was all a joke.  He begged me, but I wouldn&#x27;t tell  him my name nor where I lived, I was so ashamed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were a fool, child,&quot; said Hetty, kindly.  &quot;Wait till I turn the  light up a bit.  I wish to Heaven we had an onion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then he raised his hat,&quot; went on Cecilia, &quot;and said: &#x27;Very well.  But  I&#x27;ll find you, anyhow.  I&#x27;m going to claim my rights of salvage.&#x27;   Then he gave money to the cab-driver and told him to take me where I  wanted to go, and walked away.  What is &#x27;salvage,&#x27; Hetty?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The edge of a piece of goods that ain&#x27;t hemmed,&quot; said the shop-girl.   &quot;You must have looked pretty well frazzled out to the little hero  boy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s been three days,&quot; moaned the miniature-painter, &quot;and he hasn&#x27;t  found me yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Extend the time,&quot; said Hetty.  &quot;This is a big town.  Think of how  many girls he might have to see soaked in water with their hair down  before he would recognize you.  The stew&#x27;s getting on fine--but oh,  for an onion!  I&#x27;d even use a piece&#x27;of garlic if I had it.&quot;</p>
<p>The beef and potatoes bubbled merrily, exhaling a mouth-watering savor  that yet lacked something, leaving a hunger on the palate, a haunting,  wistful desire for some lost and needful ingredient.</p>
<p>&quot;I came near drowning in that awful river,&quot; said Cecilia, shuddering.</p>
<p>&quot;It ought to have more water in it,&quot; said Hetty; &quot;the stew, I mean.   I&#x27;ll go get some at the sink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It smells good,&quot; said the artist.</p>
<p>&quot;That nasty old North River?&quot;  objected Hetty.  &quot;It smells to me like  soap factories and wet setter-dogs--oh, you mean the stew.  Well, I  wish we had an onion for it.  Did he look like he had money?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First, he looked kind,&#x27;&#x27; said Cecilia.  &quot;I&#x27;m sure he was rich; but  that matters so little.  When he drew out his bill-folder to pay the  cab-man you couldn&#x27;t help seeing hundreds and thousands of dollars in  it.  And I looked over the cab doors and saw him leave the ferry  station in a motor-car; and the chauffeur gave him his bearskin to put  on, for he was sopping wet.  And it was only three days ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a fool!&quot; said Hetty, shortly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, the chauffeur wasn&#x27;t wet,&quot; breathed Cecilia.  &quot;And he drove the  car away very nicely.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean you,&quot; said Hetty.  &quot;For not giving him your address.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never give my address to chauffeurs,&quot; said Cecilia, haughtily.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish we had one,&quot; said Hetty, disconsolately.</p>
<p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For the stew, of course--oh, I mean an onion.&quot;</p>
<p>Hetty took a pitcher and started to the sink at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>A young man came down the stairs from above just as she was opposite  the lower step.  He was decently dressed, but pale and haggard.  His  eyes were dull with the stress of some burden of physical or mental  woe.  In his hand he bore an onion--a pink, smooth, solid, shining  onion as large around as a ninety-eight-cent alarm-clock.</p>
<p>Hetty stopped.  So did the young man.  There was something Joan of  Arc-ish, Herculean, and Una-ish in the look and pose of the shoplady-- she had cast off the roles of Job and Little-Red-Riding-Hood.  The  young man stopped at the foot of the stairs and coughed distractedly.   He felt marooned, held up, attacked, assailed, levied upon, sacked,  assessed, panhandled, browbeaten, though he knew not why.  It was the  look in Hetty&#x27;s eyes that did it.  In them he saw the Jolly Roger fly  to the masthead and an able seaman with a dirk between his teeth  scurry up the ratlines and nail it there.  But as yet he did not know  that the cargo he carried was the thing that had caused him to be so  nearly blown out of the water without even a parley.</p>
<p>&quot;Beg your pardon,&quot; said Hetty, as sweetly as her dilute acetic acid  tones permitted, &quot;but did you find that onion on the stairs?  There  was a hole in the paper bag; and I&#x27;ve just come out to look for it.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man coughed for half a minute.  The interval may have given  him the courage to defend his own property.  Also, he clutched his  pungent prize greedily, and, with a show of spirit, faced his grim  waylayer.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said huskily, &quot;I didn&#x27;t find it on the stairs.  It was given  to me by Jack Bevens, on the top floor.  If you don&#x27;t believe it, ask  him.  I&#x27;ll wait until you do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know about Bevens,&quot; said Hetty, sourly.  &quot;He writes books and  things up there for the paper-and-rags man.  We can hear the postman  guy him all over the house when he brings them thick envelopes back.   Say--do you live in the Vallambrosa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not,&quot; said the young man.  &quot;I come to see Bevens sometimes.   He&#x27;s my friend.  I live two blocks west.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do with the onion?</p>
<p>--begging your pardon,&quot; said Hetty.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going to eat it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Raw?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes: as soon as I get home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haven&#x27;t you got anything else to eat with it?&quot;</p>
<p>The young man considered briefly.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; he confessed; &quot;there&#x27;s not another scrap of anything in my  diggings to eat.  I think old Jack is pretty hard up for grub in his  shack, too.  He hated to give up the onion, but I worried him into  parting with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Man,&quot; said Hetty, fixing him with her world-sapient eyes, and laying  a bony but impressive finger on his sleeve, &quot;you&#x27;ve known trouble,  too, haven&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lots,&quot; said the onion owner, promptly.  &quot;But this onion is my own  property, honestly come by.  If you will excuse me, I must be going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; said Hetty, paling a little with anxiety.  &quot;Raw onion is a  mighty poor diet.  And so is a beef-stew without one.  Now, if you&#x27;re  Jack Bevens&#x27; friend, I guess you&#x27;re nearly right.  There&#x27;s a little  lady--a friend of mine--in my room there at the end of the hall.  Both  of us are out of luck; and we had just potatoes and meat between us.   They&#x27;re stewing now.  But it ain&#x27;t got any soul.  There&#x27;s something  lacking to it.  There&#x27;s certain things in life that are naturally  intended to fit and belong together.  One is pink cheese-cloth and  green roses, and one is ham and eggs, and one is Irish and trouble.   And the other one is beef and potatoes with onions.  And still another  one is people who are up against it and other people in the same fix.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man went into a protracted paroxysm of coughing.  With one  hand he hugged his onion to his bosom.</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt; no doubt,&quot; said he, at length.  &quot;But, as I said, I must be  going, because--&quot;</p>
<p>Hetty clutched his sleeve firmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t be a Dago, Little Brother.  Don&#x27;t cat raw onions.  Chip it in  toward the dinner and line yourself inside with the best stew you ever  licked a spoon over.  Must two ladies knock a young gentleman down and  drag him inside for the honor of dining with &#x27;em?  No harm shall  befall you, Little Brother.  Loosen up and fall into line.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man&#x27;s pale face relaxed into a grin.</p>
<p>&quot;Believe I&#x27;ll go you,&quot; he said, brightening.  &quot;If my onion is good as  a credential, I&#x27;ll accept the invitation gladly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s good as that, but better as seasoning,&quot; said Hetty.  &quot;You come  and stand outside the door till I ask my lady friend if she has any  objections.  And don&#x27;t run away with that letter of recommendation  before I come out.&quot;</p>
<p>Hetty went into her room and closed the door.  The young man waited  outside.</p>
<p>&quot;Cecilia, kid,&quot; said the shop-girl, oiling the sharp saw of her voice  as well as she could, &quot;there&#x27;s an onion outside.  With a young man  attached.  I&#x27;ve asked him in to dinner.  You ain&#x27;t going to kick, are  you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Cecilia, sitting up and patting her artistic hair.   She cast a mournful glance at the ferry-boat poster on the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;Nit,&quot; said Hetty.  &quot;It ain&#x27;t him.  You&#x27;re up against real life now.   I believe you said your hero friend had money and automobiles.  This  is a poor skeezicks that&#x27;s got nothing to eat but an onion.  But he&#x27;s  easy-spoken and not a freshy.  I imagine he&#x27;s been a gentleman, he&#x27;s  so low down now.  And we need the onion.  Shall I bring him in?  I&#x27;ll  guarantee his behavior.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hetty, dear,&quot; sighed Cecilia, &quot;I&#x27;m so hungry.  What difference does  it make whether he&#x27;s a prince or a burglar?  I don&#x27;t care.  Bring him  in if he&#x27;s got anything to eat with him.&quot;</p>
<p>Hetty went back into the hall.  The onion man was gone.  Her heart  missed a beat, and a gray look settled over her face except on her  nose and cheek-bones.  And then the tides of life flowed in again, for  she saw him leaning out of the front window at the other end of the  hall.  She hurried there.  He was shouting to some one below.  The  noise of the street overpowered the sound of her footsteps.  She  looked down over his shoulder, saw whom he was speaking to, and heard  his words.  He pulled himself in from the window-sill and saw her  standing over him.</p>
<p>Hetty&#x27;s eyes bored into him like two steel gimlets.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t lie to me,&quot; she said, calmly.  &quot;What were you going to do with  that onion?&quot;</p>
<p>The young man suppressed a cough and faced her resolutely.  His manner  was that of one who had been bearded sufficiently.</p>
<p>&quot;I was going to eat it,&quot; said he, with emphatic slowness; &quot;just as I  told you before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you have nothing else to eat at home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of work do you do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not working at anything just now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why,&quot; said Hetty, with her voice set on its sharpest edge, &quot;do  you lean out of windows and give orders to chauffeurs in green  automobiles in the street below?&quot;</p>
<p>The young man flushed, and his dull eyes began to sparkle.</p>
<p>&quot;Because, madam,&quot; said he, in accelerando tones, &quot;I pay the  chauffeur&#x27;s wages and I own the automobile--and also this onion--this  onion, madam.&quot;</p>
<p>He flourished the onion within an inch of Hetty&#x27;s nose.  The shop-lady  did not retreat a hair&#x27;s-breadth.</p>
<p>&quot;Then why do you eat onions,&quot; she said, with biting contempt, &quot;and  nothing else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never said I did,&quot; retorted the young man, heatedly.  &quot;I said I had  nothing else to eat where I live.  I am not a delicatessen store- keeper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why,&quot; pursued Hetty, inflexibly, &quot;were you going to eat a raw  onion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother,&quot; said the young man, &quot;always made me eat one for a cold.   Pardon my referring to a physical infirmity; but you may have noticed  that I have a very, very severe cold.  I was going to eat the onion  and go to bed.  I wonder why I am standing here and apologizing to you  for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you catch this cold?&quot; went on Hetty, suspiciously.</p>
<p>The young man seemed to have arrived at some extreme height of  feeling.  There were two modes of descent open to him--a burst of rage  or a surrender to the ridiculous.  He chose wisely; and the empty hall  echoed his hoarse laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a dandy,&quot; said he.  &quot;And I don&#x27;t blame you for being careful.   I don&#x27;t mind telling you.  I got wet.  I was on a North River ferry a  few days ago when a girl jumped overboard.  Of course, I--&quot;</p>
<p>Hetty extended her hand, interrupting his story.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me the onion,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The young man set his jaw a trifle harder.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me the onion,&quot; she repeated.</p>
<p>He grinned, and laid it in her hand.</p>
<p>Then Hetty&#x27;s infrequent, grim, melancholy smile showed itself.  She  took the young man&#x27;s arm and pointed with her other hand to the door  of her room.</p>
<p>&quot;Little Brother,&quot; she said, &quot;go in there.  The little fool you fished  out of the river is there waiting for you.  Go on in.  I&#x27;ll give you  three minutes before I come.  Potatoes is in there, waiting.  Go on  in, Onions.&quot;</p>
<p>After he had tapped at the door and entered, Hetty began to peel and  wash the onion at the sink.  She gave a gray look at the gray roofs  outside, and the smile on her face vanished by little jerks and  twitches.</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s us,&quot; she said, grimly, to herself, &quot;it&#x27;s us that furnishes  the beef.&quot;</p>
<p>THE HIDING OF BLACK BILL</p>
<p>A lank, strong, red-faced man with a Wellington beak and small, fiery  eyes tempered by flaxen lashes, sat on the station platform at Los  Pinos swinging his legs to and fro.  At his side sat another man, fat,  melancholy, and seedy, who seemed to be his friend.  They had the  appearance of men to whom life had appeared as a reversible coat-- seamy on both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t seen you in about four years, Ham,&quot; said the seedy man.  &quot;Which  way you been travelling?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Texas,&quot; said the red-faced man.  &quot;It was too cold in Alaska for me.   And I found it warm in Texas.  I&#x27;ll tell you about one hot spell I  went through there.</p>
<p>&quot;One morning I steps off the International at a water-tank and lets it  go on without me.  &#x27;Twas a ranch country, and fuller of spite-houses  than New York City.  Only out there they build &#x27;em twenty miles away  so you can&#x27;t smell what they&#x27;ve got for dinner, instead of running &#x27;em  up two inches from their neighbors&#x27; windows.</p>
<p>&quot;There wasn&#x27;t any roads in sight, so I footed it &#x27;cross country.  The  grass was shoe-top deep, and the mesquite timber looked just like a  peach orchard.  It was so much like a gentleman&#x27;s private estate that  every minute you expected a kennelful of bulldogs to run out and bite  you.  But I must have walked twenty miles before I came in sight of a  ranch-house.  It was a little one, about as big as an elevated- railroad station.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a little man in a white shirt and brown overalls and a pink  handkerchief around his neck rolling cigarettes under a tree in front  of the door.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Greetings,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Any refreshment, welcome, emoluments, or even  work for a comparative stranger?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh, come in,&#x27; says he, in a refined tone.  &#x27;Sit down on that stool,  please.  I didn&#x27;t hear your horse coming.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;He isn&#x27;t near enough yet,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I walked.  I don&#x27;t want to be a  burden, but I wonder if you have three or four gallons of water  handy.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You do look pretty dusty,&#x27; says he; &#x27;but our bathing arrangements--&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s a drink I want,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Never mind the dust that&#x27;s on the  outside.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;He gets me a dipper of water out of a red jar hanging up, and then  goes on:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Do you want work?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;For a time,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;This is a rather quiet section of the  country, isn&#x27;t it?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It is,&#x27; says he.  &#x27;Sometimes--so I have been told--one sees no human  being pass for weeks at a time.  I&#x27;ve been here only a month.  I  bought the ranch from an old settler who wanted to move farther west.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It suits me,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Quiet and retirement are good for a man  sometimes.  And I need a job.  I can tend bar, salt mines, lecture,  float stock, do a little middle-weight slugging, and play the piano.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Can you herd sheep ?&#x27; asks the little ranch-man.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Do you mean have I heard sheep?&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Can you herd &#x27;em--take charge of a flock of &#x27;em ?&#x27; says he.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh,&#x27; says I, &#x27;now I understand.  You mean chase &#x27;em around and bark  at &#x27;em like collie dogs.  Well, I might,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I&#x27;ve never exactly  done any sheep-herding, but I&#x27;ve often seen &#x27;em from car windows  masticating daisies, and they don&#x27;t look dangerous.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m short a herder,&#x27; says the ranchman.  &#x27;You never can depend on  the Mexicans.  I&#x27;ve only got two flocks.  You may take out my bunch of  muttons--there are only eight hundred of &#x27;em--in the morning, if you  like.  The pay is twelve dollars a month and your rations furnished.   You camp in a tent on the prairie with your sheep.  You do your own  cooking, but wood and water are brought to your camp.  It&#x27;s an easy  job.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m on,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I&#x27;ll take the job even if I have to garland my  brow and hold on to a crook and wear a loose-effect and play on a pipe  like the shepherds do in pictures.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;So the next morning the little ranchman helps me drive the flock of  muttons from the corral to about two miles out and let &#x27;em graze on a  little hillside on the prairie.  He gives me a lot of instructions  about not letting bunches of them stray off from the herd, and driving  &#x27;em down to a water-hole to drink at noon.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ll bring out your tent and camping outfit and rations in the  buckboard before night,&#x27; says he.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Fine,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;And don&#x27;t forget the rations.  Nor the camping  outfit.  And be sure to bring the tent.  Your name&#x27;s Zollicoffer,  ain&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;My name,&#x27; says he, &#x27;is Henry Ogden.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;All right, Mr.  Ogden,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Mine is Mr.  Percival Saint  Clair.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I herded sheep for five days on the Rancho Chiquito; and then the  wool entered my soul.  That getting next to Nature certainly got next  to me.  I was lonesomer than Crusoe&#x27;s goat.  I&#x27;ve seen a lot of  persons more entertaining as companions than those sheep were.  I&#x27;d  drive &#x27;em to the corral and pen &#x27;em every evening, and then cook my  corn-bread and mutton and coffee, and lie down in a tent the size of a  table-cloth, and listen to the coyotes and whippoorwills singing  around the camp.</p>
<p>&quot;The fifth evening, after I had corralled my costly but uncongenial  muttons, I walked over to the ranch-house and stepped in the door.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Mr.  Ogden,&#x27; says I, &#x27;you and me have got to get sociable.  Sheep  are all very well to dot the landscape and furnish eight-dollar cotton  suitings for man, but for table-talk and fireside companions they rank  along with five-o&#x27;clock teazers.  If you&#x27;ve got a deck of cards, or a  parcheesi outfit, or a game of authors, get &#x27;em out, and let&#x27;s get on  a mental basis.  I&#x27;ve got to do something in an intellectual line, if  it&#x27;s only to knock somebody&#x27;s brains out.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;This Henry Ogden was a peculiar kind of ranchman.  He wore finger- rings and a big gold watch and careful neckties.  And his face was  calm, and his nose-spectacles was kept very shiny.  I saw once, in  Muscogee, an outlaw hung for murdering six men, who was a dead ringer  for him.  But I knew a preacher in Arkansas that you would have taken  to be his brother.  I didn&#x27;t care much for him  either way; what I  wanted was some fellowship and communion with holy saints or lost  sinners--anything sheepless would do.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well, Saint Clair,&#x27; says he, laying down the book he was reading, &#x27;I  guess it must be pretty lonesome for you at first.  And I don&#x27;t deny  that it&#x27;s monotonous for me.  Are you sure you corralled your sheep so  they won&#x27;t stray out ?</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They&#x27;re shut up as tight as the jury of a millionaire murderer,&#x27;  says I.  &#x27;And I&#x27;ll be back with them long before they&#x27;ll need their  trained nurse.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;So Ogden digs up a deck of cards, and we play casino.  After five  days and nights of my sheep-camp it was like a toot on Broadway.  When  I caught big casino I felt as excited as if I had made a million in  Trinity.  And when H.  O.  loosened up a little and told the story  about the lady in the Pullman car I laughed for five minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;That showed what a comparative thing life is.  A man may see so much  that he&#x27;d be bored to turn his head to look at a $3,000,000 fire or  Joe Weber or the Adriatic Sea.  But let him herd sheep for a spell,  and you&#x27;ll see him splitting his ribs laughing at &#x27;Curfew Shall Not  Ring To-night,&#x27; or really enjoying himself playing cards with ladies.</p>
<p>&quot;By-and-by Ogden gets out a decanter of Bourbon, and then there is a  total eclipse of sheep.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Do you remember reading in the papers, about a month ago,&#x27; says he,  &#x27;about a train hold-up on the M.  K.  &amp; T.?  The express agent was  shot through the shoulder, and about $15,000 in currency taken.  And  it&#x27;s said that only one man did the job.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Seems to me I do,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;But such things happen so often they  don&#x27;t linger long in the human Texas mind.  Did they overtake,  overhaul, seize, or lay hands upon the despoiler?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;He escaped,&#x27; says Ogden.  &#x27;And I was just reading in a paper to-day  that the officers have tracked him down into this part of the country.   It seems the bills the robber got were all the first issue of currency  to the Second National Bank of Espinosa City.  And so they&#x27;ve followed  the trail where they&#x27;ve been spent, and it leads this way.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Ogden pours out some more Bourbon, and shoves me the bottle.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I imagine,&#x27; says I, after ingurgitating another modicum of the royal  boose, &#x27;that it wouldn&#x27;t be at all a disingenuous idea for a train  robber to run down into this part of the country to hide for a spell.   A sheep-ranch, now,&#x27; says I, would be the finest kind of a place.   Who&#x27;d ever expect to find such a desperate character among these song- birds and muttons and wild flowers?  And, by the way,&#x27; says I, kind of  looking H.  Ogden over, &#x27;was there any description mentioned of this  single-handed terror?  Was his lineaments or height and thickness or  teeth fillings or style of habiliments set forth in print ?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Why, no,&#x27; says Ogden; &#x27;they say nobody got a good sight of him  because he wore a mask.  But they know it was a train-robber called  Black Bill, because he always works alone and because he dropped a  handkerchief in the express-car that had his name on it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;All right,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I approve of Black Bill&#x27;s retreat to the  sheep-ranges.  I guess they won&#x27;t find him.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s one thousand dollars reward for his capture,&#x27; says Ogden.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I don&#x27;t need that kind of money,&#x27; says I, looking Mr.  Sheepman  straight in the eye.  &#x27;The twelve dollars a month you pay me is  enough.  I need a rest, and I can save up until I get enough to pay my  fare to Texarkana, where my widowed mother lives.  If Black Bill,&#x27; I  goes on, looking significantly at Ogden, was to have come down this  way--say, a month ago--and bought a little sheep-ranch and--&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Stop,&#x27; says Ogden, getting out of his chair and looking pretty  vicious.  &#x27;Do you mean to insinuate--&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Nothing,&#x27; says I; &#x27;no insinuations.  I&#x27;m stating a hypodermical  case.  I say, if Black Bill had come down here and bought a sheep- ranch and hired me to Little-Boy-Blue &#x27;em and treated me square and  friendly, as you&#x27;ve done, he&#x27;d never have anything to fear from me.  A  man is a man, regardless of any complications he may have with sheep  or railroad trains.  Now you know where I stand.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Ogden looks black as camp-coffee for nine seconds, and then he  laughs, amused.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You&#x27;ll do, Saint Clair,&#x27; says he.  &#x27;If I was Black Bill I wouldn&#x27;t  be afraid to trust you.  Let&#x27;s have a game or two of seven-up to- night.  That is, if you don&#x27;t mind playing with a train-robber.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ve told you,&#x27; says I, &#x27;my oral sentiments, and there&#x27;s no strings  to &#x27;em.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;While I was shuffling after the first hand, I asks Ogden, as if the  idea was a kind of a casualty, where he was from.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh,&#x27; says he, &#x27;from the Mississippi Valley.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;That&#x27;s a nice little place,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I&#x27;ve often stopped over  there.  But didn&#x27;t you find the sheets a little damp and the food  poor? Now, I hail,&#x27; says I, &#x27;from the Pacific Slope.  Ever put up  there?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Too draughty,&#x27; says Ogden.  &#x27;But if you&#x27;ve ever in the Middle West  just mention my name, and you&#x27;ll get foot-warmers and dripped coffee.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well,&#x27; says I, &#x27;I wasn&#x27;t exactly fishing for your private telephone  number and the middle name of your aunt that carried off the  Cumberland Presbyterian minister.  It don&#x27;t matter.  I just want you  to know you are safe in the hands of your shepherd.  Now, don&#x27;t play  hearts on spades, and don&#x27;t get nervous.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Still harping,&#x27; says Ogden, laughing again.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t you suppose that  if I was Black Bill and thought you suspected me, I&#x27;d put a Winchester  bullet into you and stop my nervousness, if I had any?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Not any,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;A man who&#x27;s got the nerve to hold up a train  single-handed wouldn&#x27;t do a trick like that.  I&#x27;ve knocked about  enough to know that them are the kind of men who put a value on a  friend.  Not that I can claim being a friend of yours, Mr.  Ogden,&#x27;  says I, &#x27;being only your sheep-herder; but under more expeditious  circumstances we might have been.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Forget the sheep temporarily, I beg,&#x27; says Ogden, &#x27;and cut for  deal.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;About four days afterward, while my muttons was nooning on the water- hole and I deep in the interstices of making a pot of coffee, up rides  softly on the grass a mysterious person in the garb of the being he  wished to represent.  He was dressed somewhere between a Kansas City  detective, Buffalo Bill, and the town dog-catcher of Baton Rouge.  His  chin and eye wasn&#x27;t molded on fighting lines, so I knew he was only a  scout.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Herdin&#x27; sheep?&#x27; he asks me.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well,&#x27; says I, &#x27;to a man of your evident gumptional endowments, I  wouldn&#x27;t have the nerve to state that I am engaged in decorating old  bronzes or oiling bicycle sprockets.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You don&#x27;t talk or look like a sheep-herder to me,&#x27; says he.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;But you talk like what you look like to me,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;And then he asks me who I was working for, and I shows him Rancho  Chiquito, two miles away, in the shadow of a low hill, and he tells me  he&#x27;s a deputy sheriff.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s a train-robber called Black Bill supposed to be somewhere in  these parts,&#x27; says the scout.  &#x27;He&#x27;s been traced as far as San  Antonio, and maybe farther.  Have you seen or heard of any strangers  around here during the past month?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I have not,&#x27; says I, &#x27;except a report of one over at the Mexican  quarters of Loomis&#x27; ranch, on the Frio.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;What do you know about him?&#x27; asks the deputy.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;He&#x27;s three days old,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;What kind of a looking man is the man you work for ?&#x27; he asks.   &#x27;Does old George Ramey own this place yet?  He&#x27;s run sheep here for  the last ten years, but never had no success.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;The old man has sold out and gone West,&#x27; I tells him.  &#x27;Another  sheep-fancier bought him out about a month ago.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;What kind of a looking man is he ?&#x27; asks the deputy again.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh,&#x27; says I, &#x27; a big, fat kind of a Dutchman with long whiskers and  blue specs.  I don&#x27;t think he knows a sheep from a ground-squirrel.  I  guess old George soaked him pretty well on the deal,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;After indulging himself in a lot more non-communicative information  and two-thirds of my dinner, the deputy rides away.</p>
<p>&quot;That night I mentions the matter to Ogden.  &quot;&#x27;They&#x27;re drawing the  tendrils of the octopus around Black Bill,&#x27; says I.  And then I told  him about the deputy sheriff, and how I&#x27;d described him to the deputy,  and what the deputy said about the matter.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh, well,&#x27; says Ogden, &#x27;let&#x27;s don&#x27;t borrow any of Black Bill&#x27;s  troubles.  We&#x27;ve a few of our own.  Get the Bourbon out of the  cupboard and we&#x27;ll drink to his health--unless,&#x27; says he, with his  little cackling laugh, &#x27;you&#x27;re prejudiced against train-robbers.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ll drink,&#x27; says I, &#x27;to any man who&#x27;s a friend to a friend.  And I  believe that Black Bill,&#x27; I goes on, &#x27;would be that.  So here&#x27;s to  Black Bill, and may he have good luck.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;And both of us drank.</p>
<p>&quot;About two weeks later comes shearing-time.  The sheep had to be  driven up to the ranch, and a lot of frowzy-headed Mexicans would snip  the fur off of them with back-action scissors.  So the afternoon  before the barbers were to come I hustled my underdone muttons over  the hill, across the dell, down by the winding brook, and up to the  ranch-house, where I penned &#x27;em in a corral and bade &#x27;em my nightly  adieus.</p>
<p>&quot;I went from there to the ranch-house.  I find H.  Ogden, Esquire,  lying asleep on his little cot bed.  I guess he had been overcome by  anti-insomnia or diswakefulness or some of the diseases peculiar to  the sheep business.  His mouth and vest were open, and he breathed  like a second-hand bicycle pump.  I looked at him and gave vent to  just a few musings.  &#x27;Imperial Caesar,&#x27; says I, &#x27;asleep in such a way,  might shut his mouth and keep the wind away.&#x27;</p>
<p>A man asleep is certainly a sight to make angels weep.  What good is  all his brain, muscle, backing, nerve, influence, and family  connections?  He&#x27;s at the mercy of his enemies, and more so of his  friends.  And he&#x27;s about as beautiful as a cab-horse leaning against  the Metropolitan Opera House at 12.30 A.M.  dreaming of the plains of  Arabia.  Now, a woman asleep you regard as different.  No matter how  she looks, you know it&#x27;s better for all hands for her to be that way.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I took a drink of Bourbon and one for Ogden, and started in to  be comfortable while he was taking his nap.  He had some books on his  table on indigenous subjects, such as Japan and drainage and physical  culture--and some tobacco, which seemed more to the point.</p>
<p>&quot;After I&#x27;d smoked a few, and listened to the sartorial breathing of H.   O., I happened to look out the window toward the shearing-pens, where  there was a kind of a road coming up from a kind of a road across a  kind of a creek farther away.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw five men riding up to the house.  All of &#x27;em carried guns  across their saddles, and among &#x27;em was the deputy that had talked to  me at my camp.</p>
<p>&quot;They rode up careful, in open formation, with their guns ready.  I  set apart with my eye the one I opinionated to be the boss muck-raker  of this law-and-order cavalry.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Good-evening, gents,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Won&#x27;t you &#x27;light, and tie your  horses?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;The boss rides up close, and swings his gun over till the opening in  it seems to cover my whole front elevation.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Don&#x27;t you move your hands none,&#x27; says he, &#x27;till you and me indulge  in a adequate amount of necessary conversation.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I will not,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I am no deaf-mute, and therefore will not  have to disobey your injunctions in replying.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;We are on the lookout,&#x27; says he, &#x27;for Black Bill, the man that held  up the Katy for $15,000 in May.  We are searching the ranches and  everybody on &#x27;em.  What is your name, and what do you do on this  ranch?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Captain,&#x27; says I, &#x27;Percival Saint Clair is my occupation, and my  name is sheep-herder.  I&#x27;ve got my flock of veals--no, muttons--penned  here to-night.  The shearers are coming to-morrow to give them a hair- cut--with baa-a-rum, I suppose.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Where&#x27;s the boss of this ranch?&#x27; the captain of the gang asks me.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Wait just a minute, cap&#x27;n,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Wasn&#x27;t there a kind of a  reward offered for the capture of this desperate character you have  referred to in your preamble?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s a thousand dollars reward offered,&#x27; says the captain, &#x27;but  it&#x27;s for his capture and conviction.  There don&#x27;t seem to be no  provision made for an informer.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It looks like it might rain in a day or so,&#x27; says I, in a tired way,  looking up at the cerulean blue sky.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;If you know anything about the locality, disposition, or  secretiveness of this here Black Bill,&#x27; says he, in a severe dialect,  &#x27;you are amiable to the law in not reporting it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I heard a fence-rider say,&#x27; says I, in a desultory kind of voice,  &#x27;that a Mexican told a cowboy named Jake over at Pidgin&#x27;s store on the  Nueces that he heard that Black Bill had been seen in Matamoras by a  sheepman&#x27;s cousin two weeks ago.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tell you what I&#x27;ll do, Tight Mouth,&#x27; says the captain, after looking  me over for bargains.  &#x27;If you put us on so we can scoop Black Bill,  I&#x27;ll pay you a hundred dollars out of my own--out of our own--pockets.   That&#x27;s liberal,&#x27; says he.  &#x27;You ain&#x27;t entitled to anything.  Now, what  do you say?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Cash down now?&#x27; I asks.</p>
<p>&quot;The captain has a sort of discussion with his helpmates, and they all  produce the contents of their pockets for analysis.  Out of the  general results they figured up $102.30 in cash and $31 worth of plug  tobacco.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Come nearer, capitan meeo,&#x27; says I, &#x27;and listen.&#x27;  He so did.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I am mighty poor and low down in the world,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I am working  for twelve dollars a month trying to keep a lot of animals together  whose only thought seems to be to get asunder.  Although,&#x27; says I, &#x27;I  regard myself as some better than the State of South Dakota, it&#x27;s a  come-down to a man who has heretofore regarded sheep only in the form  of chops.  I&#x27;m pretty far reduced in the world on account of foiled  ambitions and rum and a kind of cocktail they make along the P.  R.   R.  all the way from Scranton to Cincinnati--dry gin, French vermouth,  one squeeze of a lime, and a good dash of orange bitters.  If you&#x27;re  ever up that way, don&#x27;t fail to let one try you.  And, again,&#x27; says I,  &#x27;I have never yet went back on a friend.  I&#x27;ve stayed by &#x27;em when they had plenty, and when adversity&#x27;s overtaken me I&#x27;ve never forsook &#x27;em.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;But,&#x27; I goes on, &#x27;this is not exactly the case of a friend.  Twelve  dollars a month is only bowing-acquaintance money.  And I do not  consider brown beans and corn-bread the food of friendship.  I am a  poor man,&#x27; says I, &#x27;and I have a widowed mother in Texarkana.  You  will find Black Bill,&#x27; says I, &#x27;lying asleep in this house on a cot in  the room to your right.  He&#x27;s the man you want, as I know from his  words and conversation.  He was in a way a friend,&#x27; I explains, &#x27;and  if I was the man I once was the entire product of the mines of Gondola  would not have tempted me to betray him.  But,&#x27; says I, &#x27;every week  half of the beans was wormy, and not nigh enough wood in camp.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Better go in careful, gentlemen,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;He seems impatient at  times, and when you think of his late professional pursuits one would  look for abrupt actions if he was come upon sudden.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;So the whole posse unmounts and ties their horses, and unlimbers  their ammunition and equipments, and tiptoes into the house.  And I  follows, like Delilah when she set the Philip Stein on to Samson.</p>
<p>&quot;The leader of the posse shakes Ogden and wakes him up.  And then he  jumps up, and two more of the reward-hunters grab him.  Ogden was  mighty tough with all his slimness, and he gives &#x27;em as neat a single- footed tussle against odds as I ever see.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;What does this mean?&#x27; he says, after they had him down.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You&#x27;re scooped in, Mr.  Black Bill,&#x27; says the captain.  &#x27;That&#x27;s  all.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s an outrage,&#x27; says H.  Ogden, madder yet.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It was,&#x27; says the peace-and-good-will man.  &#x27;The Katy wasn&#x27;t  bothering you, and there&#x27;s a law against monkeying with express  packages.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;And he sits on H.  Ogden&#x27;s stomach and goes through his pockets  symptomatically and careful.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ll make you perspire for this,&#x27; says Ogden, perspiring some  himself.  &#x27;I can prove who I am.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;So can I,&#x27; says the captain, as he draws from H.  Ogden&#x27;s inside  coat-pocket a handful of new bills of the Second National Bank of  Espinosa City.  &#x27;Your regular engraved Tuesdays-and-Fridays visiting- card wouldn&#x27;t have a louder voice in proclaiming your indemnity than  this here currency.  You can get up now and prepare to go with us and  expatriate your sins.</p>
<p>&quot;H.  Ogden gets up and fixes his necktie.  He says no more after they  have taken the money off of him.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;A well-greased idea,&#x27; says the sheriff captain, admiring, &#x27;to slip  off down here and buy a little sheep-ranch where the hand of man is  seldom heard.  It was the slickest hide-out I ever see,&#x27; says the  captain.</p>
<p>&quot;So one of the men goes to the shearing-pen and hunts up the other  herder, a Mexican they call John Sallies, and he saddles Ogden&#x27;s  horse, and the sheriffs all ride tip close around him with their guns  in hand, ready to take their prisoner to town.</p>
<p>&quot;Before starting, Ogden puts the ranch in John Sallies&#x27; hands and  gives him orders about the shearing and where to graze the sheep, just  as if he intended to be back in a few days.  And a couple of hours  afterward one Percival Saint Clair, an ex-sheep-herder of the Rancho  Chiquito, might have been seen, with a hundred and nine dollars--wages  and blood-money--in his pocket, riding south on another horse  belonging to said ranch.&quot;</p>
<p>The red-faced man paused and listened.  The whistle of a coming  freight-train sounded far away among the low hills.</p>
<p>The fat, seedy man at his side sniffed, and shook his frowzy head  slowly and disparagingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, Snipy?&quot; asked the other.  &quot;Got the blues again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I ain&#x27;t&quot; said the seedy one, sniffing again.  &quot;But I don&#x27;t like  your talk.  You and me have been friends, off and on, for fifteen  year; and I never yet knew or heard of you giving anybody up to the  law--not no one.  And here was a man whose saleratus you had et and at  whose table you had played games of cards--if casino can be so called.   And yet you inform him to the law and take money for it.  It never was  like you, I say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This H.  Ogden,&quot; resumed the red-faced man, &quot;through a lawyer, proved  himself free by alibis and other legal terminalities, as I so heard  afterward.  He never suffered no harm.  He did me favors, and I hated  to hand him over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about the bills they found in his pocket?&quot; asked the seedy man.</p>
<p>&quot;I put &#x27;em there,&quot; said the red-faced man, &quot;while he was asleep, when  I saw the posse riding up.  I was Black Bill.  Look out, Snipy, here  she comes!  We&#x27;ll board her on the bumpers when she takes water at the  tank.&quot;</p>
<p>SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Old Jerome Warren lived in a hundred-thousand-dollar house at 35 East  Fifty-Soforth Street.  He was a down-town broker, so rich that he  could afford to walk--for his health--a few blocks in the direction of  his office every morning, and then call a cab.</p>
<p>He had an adopted son, the son of an old friend named Gilbert--Cyril  Scott could play him nicely--who was becoming a successful painter as  fast as he could squeeze the paint out of his tubes.  Another member  of the household was Barbara Ross, a stepniece.  Man is born to  trouble; so, as old Jerome had no family of his own, he took up the  burdens of others.</p>
<p>Gilbert and Barbara got along swimmingly.  There was a tacit and  tactical understanding all round that the two would stand up under a  floral bell some high noon, and promise the minister to keep old  Jerome&#x27;s money in a state of high commotion.  But at this point  complications must be introduced.</p>
<p>Thirty years before, when old Jerome was young Jerome, there was a  brother of his named Dick.  Dick went West to seek his or somebody  else&#x27;s fortune.  Nothing was heard of him until one day old Jerome had  a letter from his brother.  It was badly written on ruled paper that  smelled of salt bacon and coffee-grounds.  The writing was asthmatic  and the spelling St.  Vitusy.</p>
<p>It appeared that instead of Dick having forced Fortune to stand and  deliver, he had been held up himself, and made to give hostages to the  enemy.  That is, as his letter disclosed, he was on the point of  pegging out with a complication of disorders that even whiskey had  failed to check.  All that his thirty years of prospecting had netted  him was one daughter, nineteen years old, as per invoice, whom he was  shipping East, charges prepaid, for Jerome to clothe, feed, educate,  comfort, and cherish for the rest of her natural life or until  matrimony should them part.</p>
<p>Old Jerome was a board-walk.  Everybody knows that the world is  supported by the shoulders of Atlas; and that Atlas stands on a rail- fence; and that the rail-fence is built on a turtle&#x27;s back.  Now, the  turtle has to stand on something; and that is a board-walk made of men  like old Jerome.</p>
<p>I do not know whether immortality shall accrue to man; but if not so,  I would like to know when men like old Jerome get what is due them?</p>
<p>They met Nevada Warren at the station.  She was a little girl, deeply  sunburned and wholesomely good-looking, with a manner that was frankly  unsophisticated, yet one that not even a cigar-drummer would intrude  upon without thinking twice.  Looking at her, somehow you would expect  to see her in a short skirt and leather leggings, shooting glass balls  or taming mustangs.  But in her plain white waist and black skirt she  sent you guessing again.  With an easy exhibition of strength she  swung along a heavy valise, which the uniformed porters tried in vain  to wrest from her.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure we shall be the best of friends,&quot; said Barbara, pecking at  the firm, sunburned cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope so,&quot; said Nevada.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear little niece,&quot; said old Jerome, &quot;you are as welcome to my home  as if it were your father&#x27;s own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Nevada.</p>
<p>&quot;And I am going to call you &#x27;cousin,&#x27;&quot; said Gilbert, with his charming  smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the valise, please,&quot; said Nevada.  &quot;It weighs a million pounds.   It&#x27;s got samples from six of dad&#x27;s old mines in it,&quot; she explained to  Barbara.  &quot;I calculate they&#x27;d assay about nine cents to the thousand  tons, but I promised him to bring them along.&quot;</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>It is a common custom to refer to the usual complication between one  man and two ladies, or one lady and two men, or a lady and a man and a  nobleman, or--well, any of those problems--as the triangle.  But they  are never unqualified triangles.  They are always isosceles--never  equilateral.  So, upon the coming of Nevada Warren, she and Gilbert  and Barbara Ross lined up into such a figurative triangle; and of that  triangle Barbara formed the hypotenuse.</p>
<p>One morning old Jerome was lingering long after breakfast over the  dullest morning paper in the city before setting forth to his down- town fly-trap.  He had become quite fond of Nevada, finding in her  much of his dead brother&#x27;s quiet independence and unsuspicious  frankness.</p>
<p>A maid brought in a note for Miss Nevada Warren.</p>
<p>&quot;A messenger-boy delivered it at the door, please,&quot; she said.  &quot;He&#x27;s  waiting for an answer.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevada, who was whistling a Spanish waltz between her teeth, and  watching  the carriages and autos roll by in the street, took the  envelope.  She knew it was from Gilbert, before she opened it, by the  little gold palette in the upper left-hand corner.</p>
<p>After tearing it open she pored over the contents for a while,  absorbedly.  Then, with a serious face, she went and stood at her  uncle&#x27;s elbow.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle Jerome, Gilbert is a nice boy, isn&#x27;t he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, bless the child!&quot; said old Jerome, crackling his paper loudly;  &quot;of course he is.  I raised him myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He wouldn&#x27;t write anything to anybody that wasn&#x27;t exactly--I mean  that everybody couldn&#x27;t know and read, would he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d just like to see him try it,&quot; said uncle, tearing a handful from  his newspaper.  &quot;Why, what--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Read this note he just sent me, uncle, and see if you think it&#x27;s all  right and proper.  You see, I don&#x27;t know much about city people and  their ways.&quot;</p>
<p>Old Jerome threw his paper down and set both his feet upon it.  He  took Gilbert&#x27;s note and fiercely perused it twice, and then a third  time.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, child,&quot; said he, &quot;you had me almost excited, although I was sure  of that boy.  He&#x27;s a duplicate of his father, and he was a gilt-edged  diamond.  He only asks if you and Barbara will be ready at four  o&#x27;clock this afternoon for an automobile drive over to Long Island.  I  don&#x27;t see anything to criticise in it except the stationery.  I always  did hate that shade of blue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would it be all right to go?&quot; asked Nevada, eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, yes, child; of course.  Why not?  Still, it pleases me to  see you so careful and candid.  Go, by all means.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t know,&quot; said Nevada, demurely.  &quot;I thought I&#x27;d ask you.   Couldn&#x27;t you go with us, uncle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I?  No, no, no, no!  I&#x27;ve ridden once in a car that boy was driving.   Never again! But it&#x27;s entirely proper for you and Barbara to go.  Yes,  yes.  But I will not.  No, no, no, no!&quot;</p>
<p>Nevada flew to the door, and said to the maid:</p>
<p>&quot;You bet we&#x27;ll go.  I&#x27;ll answer for Miss Barbara.  Tell the boy to say  to Mr.  Warren, &#x27;You bet we&#x27;ll go.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nevada,&quot; called old Jerome, &quot;pardon me, my dear, but wouldn&#x27;t it be  as well to send him a note in reply?  Just a line would do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I won&#x27;t bother about that,&quot; said Nevada, gayly.  &quot;Gilbert will  understand--he always does.  I never rode in an automobile in my life;  but I&#x27;ve paddled a canoe down Little Devil River through the Lost  Horse Canon, and if it&#x27;s any livelier than that I&#x27;d like to know!&quot;</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Two months are supposed to have elapsed.</p>
<p>Barbara sat in the study of the hundred-thousand-dollar house.  It was  a good place for her.  Many places are provided in the world where men  and women may repair for the purpose of extricating themselves from  divers difficulties.  There are cloisters,  wailing-places, watering- places, confessionals, hermitages, lawyer&#x27;s offices, beauty parlors,  air-ships, and studies; and the greatest of these are studies.</p>
<p>It usually takes a hypotenuse a long time to discover that it is the  longest side of a triangle.  But it&#x27;s a long  line that has no turning.</p>
<p>Barbara was alone.  Uncle Jerome and Nevada had gone to the theatre.   Barbara had not cared to go.  She wanted to stay at home and study in  the study.  If you, miss, were a stunning New York girl, and saw every  day that a brown, ingenuous Western witch was getting hobbles and a  lasso on the young man you wanted for yourself, you, too, would lose  taste for the oxidized-silver setting of a musical comedy.</p>
<p>Barbara sat by the quartered-oak library table.  Her right arm rested  upon the table, and her dextral fingers nervously manipulated a sealed  letter.  The letter was addressed to Nevada Warren; and in the upper  left-hand corner of the envelope was Gilbert&#x27;s little gold palette.   It had been delivered at nine o&#x27;clock, after Nevada had left.</p>
<p>Barbara would have given her pearl necklace to know what the letter  contained; but she could not open and read it by the aid of steam, or  a pen-handle, or a hair-pin, or any of the generally approved methods,  because her position in society forbade such an act.  She had tried to  read some of the lines of the letter by holding the envelope up to a  strong light and pressing it hard against the paper, but Gilbert had  too good a taste in stationery to make that possible.</p>
<p>At eleven-thirty the theatre-goers returned.  it was a delicious  winter night.  Even so far as from the cab to the door they were  powdered thickly with the big flakes downpouring diagonally from the  cast.  Old Jerome growled good-naturedly about villanous cab service  and blockaded streets.  Nevada, colored like a rose, with sapphire  eyes, babbled of the stormy nights in the mountains around dad&#x27;s  cabin.  During all these wintry apostrophes, Barbara, cold at heart,  sawed wood--the only appropriate thing she could think of to do.</p>
<p>Old Jerome went immediately up-stairs to hot-water-bottles and  quinine.  Nevada fluttered into the study, the only cheerfully lighted  room, subsided into an arm-chair, and, while at the interminable task  of unbuttoning her elbow gloves, gave oral testimony as to the  demerits of the &quot;show.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I think Mr.  Fields is really amusing--sometimes,&quot; said Barbara.   &quot;Here is a letter for you, dear, that came by special delivery just  after you had gone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it from?&quot; asked Nevada, tugging at a button.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, really,&quot; said Barbara, with a smile, &quot;I can only guess.  The  envelope has that queer little thing in one corner that Gilbert calls  a palette, but which looks to me rather like a gilt heart on a school- girl&#x27;s valentine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder what he&#x27;s writing to me about&quot; remarked Nevada, listlessly.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re all alike,&quot; said Barbara; &quot;all women.  We try to find out what  is in a letter by studying the postmark.  As a last resort we use  scissors, and read it from the bottom upward.  Here it is.&quot;</p>
<p>She made a motion as if to toss the letter across the table to Nevada.</p>
<p>&quot;Great catamounts!&quot; exclaimed Nevada.  &quot;These centre-fire buttons are  a nuisance.  I&#x27;d rather wear buckskins.  Oh, Barbara, please shuck the  hide off that letter and read it.  It&#x27;ll be midnight before I get  these gloves off!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, dear, you don&#x27;t want me to open Gilbert&#x27;s letter to you?  It&#x27;s  for you, and you wouldn&#x27;t wish any one else to read it, of course!&quot;</p>
<p>Nevada raised her steady, calm, sapphire eyes from her gloves.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody writes me anything that everybody mightn&#x27;t read,&quot; she said.   &quot;Go on, Barbara.  Maybe Gilbert wants us to go out in his car again  to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Curiosity can do more things than kill a cat; and if emotions, well  recognized as feminine, are inimical to feline life, then jealousy  would soon leave the whole world catless.  Barbara opened the letter,  with an indulgent, slightly bored air.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, dear,&quot; said she, &quot;I&#x27;ll read it if you want me to.&quot;</p>
<p>She slit the envelope, and read the missive with swift-travelling  eyes; read it again, and cast a quick, shrewd glance at Nevada, who,  for the time, seemed to consider gloves as the world of her interest,  and letters from rising artists as no more than messages from Mars.</p>
<p>For a quarter of a minute Barbara looked at Nevada with a strange  steadfastness; and then a smile so small that it widened her mouth  only the sixteenth part of an inch, and narrowed her eyes no more than  a twentieth, flashed like an inspired thought across her face.</p>
<p>Since the beginning no woman has been a mystery to another woman   Swift as light travels, each penetrates the heart and mind of another,  sifts her sister&#x27;s words of their cunningest disguises, reads her most  hidden desires, and plucks the sophistry from her wiliest talk like  hairs from a comb, twiddling them sardonically between her thumb and  fingers before letting them float away on the breezes of fundamental  doubt.  Long ago Eve&#x27;s son rang the door-bell of the family residence  in Paradise Park, bearing a strange lady on his arm, whom he  introduced.  Eve took her daughter-in-law aside and lifted a classic  eyebrow.</p>
<p>&quot;The Land of Nod,&quot; said the bride, languidly flirting the leaf of a  palm.  &#x27;&#x27;I suppose you&#x27;ve been there, of course?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not lately,&quot; said Eve, absolutely unstaggered.  &quot;Don&#x27;t you think the  apple-sauce they serve over there is execrable?  I rather like that  mulberry-leaf tunic effect, dear; but, of course, the real fig goods  are not to be had over there.  Come over behind this lilac-bush while  the gentlemen split a celery tonic.  I think the caterpillar-holes  have made your dress open a little in the back.&quot;</p>
<p>So, then and there--according to the records--was the alliance formed  by the only two who&#x27;s-who ladies in the world.  Then it was agreed  that woman should forever remain as clear as a pane of glass-though  glass was yet to be discovered-to other women, and that she should  palm herself off on man as a mystery.</p>
<p>Barbara seemed to hesitate.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, Nevada,&quot; she said, with a little show of embarrassment, &quot;you  shouldn&#x27;t have insisted on my opening this.  I-I&#x27;m sure it wasn&#x27;t  meant for any one else to know.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevada forgot her gloves for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Then read it aloud,&quot; she said.  &quot;Since you&#x27;ve already read it, what&#x27;s  the difference?  If Mr.  Warren has written to me something that any  one else oughtn&#x27;t to know, that is all the more reason why everybody  should know it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Barbara, &quot;this is what it says:</p>
<p>&#x27;Dearest Nevada--Come to my studio at twelve o&#x27;clock to-night.  Do not  fail.&#x27;&quot;  Barbara rose and dropped the note in Nevada&#x27;s lap.  &quot;I&#x27;m  awfully sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;that I knew.  It isn&#x27;t like Gilbert.  There  must be some mistake.  Just consider that I am ignorant of it, will  you, dear? I must go up-stairs now, I have such a headache.  I&#x27;m sure  I don&#x27;t understand the note.  Perhaps Gilbert has been dining too  well, and will explain.  Good night!&quot;</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Nevada tiptoed to the hall, and heard Barbara&#x27;s door close upstairs.   The bronze clock in the study told the hour of twelve was fifteen  minutes away.  She ran swiftly to the front door, and let herself out  into the snow-storm.  Gilbert Warren&#x27;s studio was six squares away.</p>
<p>By aerial ferry the white, silent forces of the storm attacked the  city from beyond the sullen East River.  Already the snow lay a foot  deep on the pavements, the drifts heaping themselves like scaling- ladders against the walls of the besieged town.  The Avenue was as  quiet as a street in Pompeii.  Cabs now and then skimmed past like  white-winged gulls over a moonlit ocean; and less frequent motor-cars- -sustaining the comparison--hissed through the foaming waves like  submarine boats on their jocund, perilous journeys.</p>
<p>Nevada plunged like a wind-driven storm-petrel on her way.  She looked  up at the ragged sierras of cloud-capped buildings that rose above the  streets, shaded by the night lights and the congealed vapors to gray,  drab, ashen, lavender, dun, and cerulean tints.  They were so like the  wintry mountains of her Western home that she felt a satisfaction such  as the hundred-thousand-dollar house had seldom brought her.</p>
<p>A policeman caused her to waver on a corner, just by his eye and  weight.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Mabel!&quot; said he.  &quot;Kind of late for you to be out, ain&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I--I am just going to the drug store,&quot; said Nevada, hurrying past  him.</p>
<p>The excuse serves as a passport for the most sophisticated.  Does it  prove that woman never progresses, or that she sprang from Adam&#x27;s rib,  full-fledged in intellect and wiles?</p>
<p>Turning eastward, the direct blast cut down Nevada&#x27;s speed one-half.   She made zigzag tracks in the snow; but she was as tough as a pinon  sapling, and bowed to it as gracefully.  Suddenly the studio-building  loomed before her, a familiar landmark, like a cliff above some well- remembered canon.  The haunt of business and its hostile neighbor,  art, was darkened and silent.  The elevator stopped at ten.</p>
<p>Up eight flights of Stygian stairs Nevada climbed, and rapped firmly  at the door numbered &quot;89.&quot;  She had been there many times before, with  Barbara and Uncle Jerome.</p>
<p>Gilbert opened the door.  He had a crayon pencil in one hand, a green  shade over his eyes, and a pipe in his mouth.  The pipe dropped to the  floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Am I late?&quot; asked Nevada.  &quot;I came as quick as I could.  Uncle and me  were at the theatre this evening.  Here I am, Gilbert!&quot;</p>
<p>Gilbert did a Pygmalion-and-Galatea act.  He changed from a statue of  stupefaction to a young man with a problem to tackle.  He admitted  Nevada, got a whiskbroom, and began to brush the snow from her  clothes.  A great lamp, with a green shade, hung over an easel, where  the artist had been sketching in crayon.</p>
<p>&quot;You wanted me,&quot; said Nevada simply, &quot; and I came.  You said so in  your letter.  What did you send for me for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You read my letter?&quot; inquired Gilbert, sparring for wind.</p>
<p>&quot;Barbara read it to me.  I saw it afterward.  It said: &#x27;Come to my  studio at twelve to-night, and do not fail.&#x27;  I thought you were sick,  of course, but you don&#x27;t seem to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aha!&quot; said Gilbert irrelevantly.  &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you why I asked you to  come, Nevada.  I want you to marry me immediately -- to-night.  What&#x27;s  a little snow-storm?  Will you do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You might have noticed that I would, long ago,&quot; said Nevada.  &quot;And  I&#x27;m rather stuck on the snow-storm idea, myself.  I surely would hate  one of these flowery church noon-weddings.  Gilbert, I didn&#x27;t know you  had grit enough to propose it this way.  Let&#x27;s shock &#x27;em--it&#x27;s our  funeral, ain&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bet!&quot; said Gilbert.  &quot;Where did I hear that expression?&quot; he added  to himself.  &quot;Wait a minute, Nevada; I want to do a little &#x27;phoning.&quot;</p>
<p>He shut himself in a little dressing-room, and called upon the  lightnings of tile heavens--condensed into unromantic numbers and  districts.</p>
<p>&quot;That you, Jack?  You confounded sleepyhead!  Yes, wake up; this is  me--or I--oh, bother the difference in grammar!  I&#x27;m going to be  married right away.  Yes!  Wake up your sister--don&#x27;t answer me back;  bring her along, too--you must!.  Remind Agnes of the time I saved her  from drowning in Lake Ronkonkoma--I know it&#x27;s caddish to refer to it,  but she must come with you.  Yes.  Nevada is here, waiting.  We&#x27;ve  been engaged quite a while.  Some opposition among the relatives, you  know, and we have to pull it off this way.  We&#x27;re waiting here for  you.  Don&#x27;t let Agnes out-talk you--bring her!  You will?  Good old  boy!  I&#x27;ll order a carriage to call for you, double-quick time.   Confound you, Jack, you&#x27;re all right!&quot;</p>
<p>Gilbert returned to the room where Nevada waited.</p>
<p>&quot;My old friend, Jack Peyton, and his sister were to have been here at  a quarter to twelve,&quot; he explained; &quot;but Jack is so confoundedly slow.   I&#x27;ve just &#x27;phoned them to hurry.  They&#x27;ll be here in a few minutes.   I&#x27;m the happiest man in the world, Nevada!  What did you do with the  letter I sent you to-day ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve got it cinched here,&quot; said Nevada, pulling it out from beneath  her opera-cloak.</p>
<p>Gilbert drew the letter from the envelope and looked it over  carefully.  Then he looked at Nevada thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Didn&#x27;t you think it rather queer that I should ask you to come to my  studio at midnight?&quot; he asked. &quot;Why, no,&quot; said Nevada, rounding her eyes.  &quot;Not if you needed me.   Out West, when a pal sends you a hurry call--ain&#x27;t that what you say  here ?--we get there first and talk about it after the row is over.   And it&#x27;s usually snowing there, too, when things happen.  So I didn&#x27;t  mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Gilbert rushed into another room, and came back burdened with  overcoats warranted to turn wind, rain, or snow.</p>
<p>&quot;Put this raincoat on,&quot; he said, holding it for her.  &quot;We have a  quarter of a mile to go.  Old Jack and his sister will be here in a  few minutes.&quot;  He began to struggle into a heavy coat.  &quot;Oh, Nevada,&quot;  he said, &quot;just look at the head-lines on the front page of that  evening paper on the table, will you?  It&#x27;s about your section of the  West, and I know it will interest you.&quot;</p>
<p>He waited a full minute, pretending to find trouble in the getting on  of his overcoat, and then turned.  Nevada had not moved.  She was  looking at him with strange and pensive directness.  Her cheeks had a  flush on them beyond the color that had been contributed by the wind  and snow; but her eyes were steady.</p>
<p>&quot;I was going to tell you,&quot; she said, &quot;anyhow, before you--before we-- before-well, before anything.  Dad never gave me a day of schooling.   I never learned to read or write a darned word.  Now if--&quot; Pounding their uncertain way up-stairs, the feet of Jack, the  somnolent, and Agnes, the grateful, were heard.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>When Mr.  and Mrs.  Gilbert Warren were spinning softly homeward in a  closed carriage, after the ceremony, Gilbert s said:</p>
<p>&quot;Nevada, would you really like to know what I wrote you in the letter  that you received to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fire away!&quot; said his bride.</p>
<p>&quot;Word for word,&quot; said Gilbert, &quot;it was this: &#x27;My dear Miss Warren-You  were right about the flower.  It was a hydrangea, and not a lilac.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Nevada.  &quot;But let&#x27;s forget it.  The joke&#x27;s on  Barbara, anyway!&quot;</p>
<p>THIMBLE, THIMBLE</p>
<p>These are the directions for finding the I office of Carteret &amp;  Carteret, Mill Supplies and Leather Belting: You follow the Broadway trail down until you pass the Crosstown Line,  the Bread Line, and the Dead Line, and come to the Big Canons of the  Moneygrubber Tribe.  Then you turn to the left, to the right, dodge a  push-cart and the tongue of a two-ton, four-horse dray and hop, skip,  and jump to a granite ledge on the side of a twenty-one-story  synthetic mountain of stone and iron.  In the twelfth story is the  office of Carteret &amp; Carteret.  The factory where they make the mill  supplies and leather belting is in Brooklyn.  Those commodities--to  say nothing of Brooklyn--not being of interest to you, let us hold the  incidents within the confines of a one-act, one-scene play, thereby  lessening the toil of the reader and the expenditure of the publisher.   So, if you have the courage to face four pages of type and Carteret &amp;  Carteret&#x27;s office boy, Percival, you shall sit on a varnished chair in  the inner office and peep at the little comedy of the Old Nigger Man,  the Hunting-Case Watch, and the Open-Faced Question--mostly borrowed  from the late Mr.  Frank Stockton, as you will conclude.</p>
<p>First, biography (but pared to the quick) must intervene.  I am for  the inverted sugar-coated quinine pill--the bitter on the outside.</p>
<p>The Carterets were, or was (Columbia College professors please rule),  an old Virginia family.  Long time ago the gentlemen of the family had  worn lace ruffles and carried tinless foils and owned plantations and  had slaves to burn.  But the war had greatly reduced their holdings.   (Of course you can perceive at once that this flavor has been  shoplifted from Mr.  F.  Hopkinson Smith, in spite of the &quot;et&quot; after  &quot;Carter.&quot;)  Well, anyhow:</p>
<p>In digging up the Carteret history I shall not take you farther back  than the year 1620.  The two original American Carterets came over in  that year, but by different means of transportation.  One brother,  named John, came in the Mayflower and became a Pilgrim Father.  You&#x27;ve  seen his picture on the covers of the Thanksgiving magazines, hunting  turkeys in the deep snow with a blunderbuss.  Blandford Carteret, the  other brother, crossed the pond in his own brigantine, landed on the  Virginia coast, and became an F.F.V.  John became distinguished for  piety and shrewdness in business; Blandford for his pride, juleps;  marksmanship, and vast slave-cultivated plantations.</p>
<p>Then came the Civil War.  (I must condense this historical  interpolation.)  Stonewall Jackson was shot; Lee surrendered; Grant</p>
<p>toured the world; cotton went to nine cents; Old Crow whiskey and Jim  Crow cars were invented; the Seventy-ninth Massachusetts Volunteers  returned to the Ninety-seventh Alabama Zouaves the battle flag of  Lundy&#x27;s Lane which they bought at a second-hand store in Chelsea kept  by a man named Skzchnzski; Georgia sent the President a sixty-pound  watermelon--and that brings us up to the time when the story begins.   My! but that was sparring for an opening!  I really must brush op on  my Aristotle.</p>
<p>The Yankee Carterets went into business in New York long before the  war.  Their house, as far as Leather Belting and Mill Supplies was  concerned, was as musty and arrogant and solid as one of those old  East India tea-importing concerns that you read about in Dickens.   There were some rumors of a war behind its counters, but not enough to  affect the business.</p>
<p>During and after the war, Blandford Carteret, F.F.V., lost his  plantations, juleps, marksmanship, and life.  He bequeathed little  more than his pride to his surviving family.  So it came to pass that  Blandford Carteret, the Fifth, aged fifteen, was invited by the  leather-and-millsupplies branch of that name to come North and learn  business instead of hunting foxes and boasting of the glory of his  fathers on the reduced acres of his impoverished family.  The boy  jumped at the chance; and, at the age of twenty-five, sat in the  office of the firm equal partner with John, the Fifth, of the  blunderbuss-and-turkey branch.  Here the story begins again.</p>
<p>The young men were about the same age, smooth of face, alert, easy of  manner, and with an air that promised mental and physical quickness.   They were razored, blue-serged, straw-hatted, and pearl stick-pinned  like other young New Yorkers who might be millionaires or bill clerks.</p>
<p>One afternoon at four o&#x27;clock, in the private office of the firm,  Blandford Carteret opened a letter that a clerk had just brought to  his desk.  After reading it, he chuckled audibly for nearly a minute.   John looked around from his desk inquiringly.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s from mother,&quot; said Blandford.  &quot;I&#x27;ll read you the funny part of  it.  She tells me all the neighborhood news first, of course, and then  cautions me against getting my feet wet and musical comedies.  After  that come some vital statistics about calves and pigs and an estimate  of the wheat crop.  And now I&#x27;ll quote some:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;And what do you think! Old Uncle Jake, who was seventy-six last  Wednesday, must go travelling.  Nothing would do but he must go to New  York and see his &quot;young Marster Blandford.&quot;  Old as he is, he has a  deal of common sense, so I&#x27;ve let him go.  I couldn&#x27;t refuse him--he  seemed to have concentrated all his hopes and desires into this one  adventure into the wide world.  You know he was born on the  plantation, and has never been ten miles away from it in his life.   And he was your father&#x27;s body servant during the war, and has been  always a faithful vassal and servant of the family.  He has often seen  the gold watch--the watch that was your father&#x27;s and your father&#x27;s  father&#x27;s.  I told him it was to be yours, And he begged me to allow  him to take it to you and to put it into your hands himself.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;So he has it, carefully inclosed in a buck-skin case, and is  bringing it to you with all the pride and importance of a king&#x27;s  messenger.  I gave him money for the round trip and for a two weeks&#x27;  stay in the city.  I wish you would see to it that he gets comfortable  quarters--Jake won&#x27;t need much looking after--he&#x27;s able to take care  of himself.  But I have read in the papers that African bishops and  colored potentates generally have much trouble in obtaining food and  lodging in the Yankee metropolis.  That may be all right; but I don&#x27;t  see why the best hotel there shouldn&#x27;t take Jake in.  Still, I suppose  it&#x27;s a rule.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I gave him full directions about finding you, and packed his valise  myself.  You won&#x27;t have to bother with him; but I do hope you&#x27;ll see  that he is made comfortable.  Take the watch that he brings you--it&#x27;s  almost a decoration.  It has been worn by true Carterets, and there  isn&#x27;t a stain upon it nor a false movement of the wheels.  Bringing it  to you is the crowning joy of old Jake&#x27;s life.  I wanted him to have  that little outing and that happiness before it is too late.  You have  often heard us talk about how Jake, pretty badly wounded himself,  crawled through the reddened grass at Chancellorsville to where your  father lay with the bullet in his dear heart, and took the watch from  his pocket to keep it from the &quot;Yanks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;So, my son, when the old man comes consider him as a frail but  worthy messenger from the old-time life and home.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You have been so long away from home and so long among the people  that we have always regarded as aliens that I&#x27;m not sure that Jake  will know you when he sees you.  But Jake has a keen perception, and I  rather believe that he will know a Virginia Carteret at sight.  I  can&#x27;t conceive that even ten years in Yankee-land could change a boy  of mine.  Anyhow, I&#x27;m sure you will know Jake.  I put eighteen collars  in his valise.  If he should have to buy others, he wears a number 15  1/2.  Please see that he gets the right ones.  He will be no trouble  to you at all.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;If you are not too busy, I&#x27;d like for you to find him a place to  board where they have white-meal corn-bread, and try to keep him from  taking his shoes off in your office or on the street.  His right foot  swells a little, and he likes to be comfortable.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;If you can spare the time, count his handkerchiefs when they come  back from the wash.  I bought him a dozen new ones before he left.  He  should be there about the time this letter reaches you.  I told him to  go straight to your office when he arrives.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Blandford had finished the reading of this, something  happened (as there should happen in stories and must happen on the  stage).</p>
<p>Percival, the office boy, with his air of despising the world&#x27;s output  of mill supplies and leather belting, came in to announce that a  colored gentleman was outside to see Mr.  Blandford Carteret.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring him in,&quot; said Blandford, rising.</p>
<p>John Carteret swung around in his chair and said to Percival:  &quot;Ask  him to wait a few minutes outside.  We&#x27;ll let you know when to bring  him in.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he turned to his cousin with one of those broad, slow smiles that  was an inheritance of all the Carterets, and said:</p>
<p>&quot;Bland,  I&#x27;ve  always had a consuming curiosity to understand the  differences that you haughty Southerners believe to exist between &#x27;you  all &#x27; and the people of the North.  Of course, I know that you  consider yourselves made out of finer clay and look upon Adam as only  a collateral branch of your ancestry; but I don&#x27;t know why.  I never  could understand the differences between us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, John,&quot; said Blandford, laughing, &quot;what you don&#x27;t understand  about it is just the difference, of course.  I suppose it was the  feudal way in which we lived that gave us our lordly baronial airs and  feeling of superiority.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you are not feudal, now,&quot; went on John.  &quot;Since we licked you and  stole your cotton and mules you&#x27;ve had to go to work just as we  &#x27;damyankees,&#x27; as you call us, have always been doing.  And you&#x27;re just  as proud and exclusive and upper-classy as you were before the war.   So it wasn&#x27;t your money that caused it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it was the climate,&quot; said Blandford, lightly, &quot;or maybe our  negroes spoiled us.  I&#x27;ll call old Jake in, now.  I&#x27;ll be glad to see  the old villain again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait just a moment,&quot; said John.  &quot;I&#x27;ve got a little theory I want to  test.  You and I are pretty much alike in our general appearance.  Old  Jake hasn&#x27;t seen you since you were fifteen.  Let&#x27;s have him in and  play fair and see which of us gets the watch.  The old darky surrey  ought to be able to pick out his &#x27;young marster&#x27; without any trouble.   The alleged aristocratic superiority of a &#x27;reb&#x27; ought to be visible to  him at once.  He couldn&#x27;t make the mistake of handing over the  timepiece to a Yankee, of course.  The loser buys the dinner this  evening and two dozen 15 1/2 collars for Jake.  Is it a go?&quot;</p>
<p>Blandford agreed heartily.  Percival was summoned, and told to usher  the &quot;colored gentleman&quot; in.</p>
<p>Uncle Jake stepped inside the private office cautiously.  He was a  little old man, as black as soot, wrinkled and bald except for a  fringe of white wool, cut decorously short, that ran over his ears and  around his head.  There was nothing of the stage &quot;uncle&quot; about him:  his black suit nearly fitted him; his shoes shone, and his straw hat  was banded with a gaudy ribbon.  In his right hand he carried  something carefully concealed by his closed fingers.</p>
<p>Uncle Jake stopped a few steps from the door.  Two young men sat in  their revolving desk-chairs ten feet apart and looked at him in  friendly silence.  His gaze slowly shifted many times from one to the  other.  He felt sure that he was in the presence of one, at least, of  the revered family among whose fortunes his life had begun and was to  end.</p>
<p>One had the pleasing but haughty Carteret air; the other had the  unmistakable straight, long family nose.  Both had the keen black  eyes, horizontal brows, and thin, smiling lips that had distinguished  both the Carteret of the Mayflower and him of the brigantine.  Old  Jake had thought that he could have picked out his young master  instantly from a thousand Northerners; but he found himself in  difficulties.  The best he could do was to use strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;Howdy, Marse Blandford--howdy, suh ?&quot; he said, looking midway between  the two young men.</p>
<p>&quot;Howdy, Uncle Jake?&quot; they both answered pleasantly and in unison.   &quot;Sit down.  Have you brought the watch ?&quot;</p>
<p>Uncle Jake chose a hard-bottom chair at a respectful distance, sat on  the edge of it, and laid his hat carefully on the floor.  The watch in  its buckskin case he gripped tightly.  He had not risked his life on  the battle-field to rescue that watch from his &quot;old marster&#x27;s&quot; foes to  hand it over again to the enemy without a struggle.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, suh; I got it in my hand, suh.  I&#x27;m gwine give it to you right  away in jus&#x27; a minute.  Old Missus told me to put it in young Marse  Blandford&#x27;s hand and tell him to wear it for the family pride and  honor.  It was a mighty longsome trip for an old nigger man to make-- ten thousand miles, it must be, back to old Vi&#x27;ginia, suh.  You&#x27;ve  growed mightily, young marster.  I wouldn&#x27;t have reconnized you but  for yo&#x27; powerful resemblance to old marster.&quot;</p>
<p>With admirable diplomacy the old man kept his eyes roaming in the  space between the two men.  His words might have been addressed to  either.  Though neither wicked nor perverse, he was seeking for a  sign.</p>
<p>Blandford and John exchanged winks.</p>
<p>&quot;I reckon you done got you ma&#x27;s letter,&quot; went on Uncle Jake.  &quot;She  said she was gwine to write to you &#x27;bout my comin&#x27; along up this er- way.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, Uncle Jake,&quot; said John briskly.  &quot;My cousin and I have just  been notified to expect you.  We are both Carterets, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Although one of us,&quot; said Blandford, &quot;was born and raised in the  North.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So if you will hand over the watch--&quot; said John.</p>
<p>&quot;My cousin and I-&quot; said Blandford.</p>
<p>&#x27;Will then see to it--&quot; said John.</p>
<p>&quot;That comfortable quarters are found for you,&quot; said Blandford.</p>
<p>With creditable ingenuity, old Jake set up a cackling, high-pitched,  protracted laugh.  He beat his knee, picked up his hat and bent the  brim in an apparent paroxysm of humorous appreciation.  The seizure  afforded him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes impartially  between, above, and beyond his two tormentors.</p>
<p>&quot;I sees what!&quot; he chuckled, after a while.  &quot;You gen&#x27;lemen is tryin&#x27;  to have fun with the po&#x27; old nigger.  But you can&#x27;t fool old Jake.  I  knowed you, Marse Blandford, the minute I sot eyes on you.  You was a  po&#x27; skimpy little boy no mo&#x27; than about fo&#x27;teen when you lef&#x27; home to  come No&#x27;th; but I knowed you the minute I sot eyes on you.  You is the  mawtal image of old marster.  The other gen&#x27;leman resembles you  mightily, suh; but you can&#x27;t fool old Jake on a member of the old  Vi&#x27;ginia family.  No suh.&quot;</p>
<p>At exactly the same time both Carterets smiled and extended a hand for  the watch.</p>
<p>Uncle Jake&#x27;s wrinkled, black face lost the expression of amusement to  which he had vainly twisted it.  He knew that he was being teased, and  that it made little real difference, as far as its safety went, into  which of those outstretched hands he placed the family treasure.  But  it seemed to him that not only his own pride and loyalty but much of  the Virginia Carterets&#x27; was at stake.  He had heard down South during  the war about that other branch of the family that lived in the North  and fought on &quot;the yuther side,&quot; and it had always grieved him.  He  had followed his &quot;old marster&#x27;s&quot; fortunes from stately luxury through  war to almost poverty.  And now, with the last relic and reminder of  him, blessed by &quot;old missus,&quot; and intrusted implicitly to his care, he  had come ten thousand miles (as it seemed) to deliver it into the  hands of the one who was to wear it and wind it and cherish it and  listen to it tick off the unsullied hours that marked the lives of the  Carterets--of Virginia.</p>
<p>His experience and conception of the Yankees had been an impression of  tyrants--&quot;low-down, common trash&quot;--in blue, laying waste with fire and  sword.  He had seen the smoke of many burning homesteads almost as  grand as Carteret Hall ascending to the drowsy Southern skies.  And  now he was face to face with one of them--and he could not distinguish  him from his &quot;young marster&quot; whom he had come to find and bestow upon  him the emblem of his kingship--even as the arm &quot;clothed in white  samite, mystic, wonderful&quot; laid Excalibur in the right hand of Arthur.   He saw before him two young men, easy, kind, courteous, welcoming,  either of whom might have been the one he sought.  Troubled,  bewildered, sorely grieved at his weakness of judgment, old Jake  abandoned his loyal subterfuges.  His right hand sweated against the  buckskin cover of the watch.  He was deeply humiliated and chastened.   Seriously, now, his prominent, yellow-white eyes closely scanned the  two young men.  At the end of his scrutiny he was conscious of but one  difference between them.  One wore a narrow black tie with a white  pearl stickpin.  The other&#x27;s &quot;four-in-hand &quot; was a narrow blue one  pinned with a black pearl.</p>
<p>And then, to old Jake&#x27;s relief, there came a sudden distraction.   Drama knocked at the door with imperious knuckles, and forced Comedy  to the wings, and Drama peeped with a smiling but set face over the  footlights.</p>
<p>Percival, the hater of mill supplies, brought in a card, which he  handed, with the manner of one bearing a cartel, to Blue-Tie.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Olivia De Ormond,&#x27;&quot; read Blue-Tie from the card.  He looked  inquiringly at his cousin.</p>
<p>&quot;Why not have her in,&quot; said Black-Tie, &quot;and bring matters to a  conclusion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle Jake,&quot; said one of the young men, &quot;would you mind taking that  chair over there in the corner for a while?  A lady is coming in--on  some business.  We&#x27;ll take up your case afterward.&quot;</p>
<p>The lady whom Percival ushered in was young and petulantly, decidedly,  freshly, consciously, and intentionally pretty.  She was dressed with  such expensive plainness that she made you consider lace and ruffles  as mere tatters and rags.  But one great ostrich plume that she wore  would have marked her anywhere in the army of beauty as the wearer of  the merry helmet of Navarre.</p>
<p>Miss De Ormond accepted the swivel chair at Blue-Tie&#x27;s desk.  Then the  gentlemen drew leather-upholstered seats conveniently near, and spoke  of the weather.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said she, &quot;I noticed it was warmer.  But I mustn&#x27;t take up too  much of your time during business hours.  That is,&quot; she continued,  &quot;unless we talk business.&quot;</p>
<p>She addressed her words to Blue-Tie, with a charming smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said he.  &quot;You don&#x27;t mind my cousin being present, do  you?  We are generally rather confidential with each other-especially  in business matters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; caroled Miss De Ormond.  &quot;I&#x27;d rather he did hear.  He knows  all about it, anyhow.  In fact, he&#x27;s quite a material witness because  he was present when you--when it happened.  I thought you might want  to talk things over before--well, before any action is taken, as I  believe the lawyers say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you anything in the way of a proposition to make?&quot; asked Black- Tie.</p>
<p>Miss De Ormond looked reflectively at the neat toe of one of her dull  kid-pumps.</p>
<p>&quot;I had a proposal made to me,&quot; she said.  &quot;If the proposal sticks it  cuts out the proposition.  Let&#x27;s have that settled first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, as far as--&quot; began Blue-Tie.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me, cousin,&quot; interrupted Black-Tie, &quot;if you don&#x27;t mind my  cutting in.&quot;  And then he turned, with a good-natured air, toward the  lady.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, let&#x27;s recapitulate a bit,&quot; he said cheerfully.  &quot;All three of  us, besides other mutual acquaintances, have been out on a good many  larks together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll have to call the birds by another name,&quot; said Miss De  Ormond.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; responded Black-Tie, with unimpaired cheerfulness;  &quot;suppose we say &#x27;squabs&#x27; when we talk about the &#x27;proposal&#x27; and &#x27;larks&#x27;  when we discuss the &#x27;proposition.&#x27;  You have a quick mind, Miss De  Ormond.  Two months ago some half-dozen of us went in a motor-car for  day&#x27;s run into the country.  We stopped at a road-house for dinner.   My cousin proposed marriage to you then and there.  He was influenced  to do so, of course, by the beauty and charm which no one can deny  that you possess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I had you for a press agent, Mr.  Carteret,&quot; said the beauty,  with a dazzling smile.</p>
<p>&quot;You are on the stage, Miss De Ormond,&quot; went on Black-Tie.  &quot;You have  had, doubtless, many admirers, and perhaps other proposals.  You must  remember, too, that we were a party of merrymakers on that occasion.   There were a good many corks pulled.  That the proposal of marriage  was made to you by my cousin we cannot deny.  But hasn&#x27;t it been your  experience that, by common consent, such things lose their seriousness  when viewed in the next day&#x27;s sunlight?  Isn&#x27;t there something of a  &#x27;code&#x27; among good &#x27;sports&#x27;--I use the word in its best sense--that  wipes out each day the follies of the evening previous?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Miss De Ormond.  &quot;I know that very well.  And I&#x27;ve  always played up to it.  But as you seem to be conducting the case-- with the silent consent of the defendant--I&#x27;ll tell you something  more.  I&#x27;ve got letters from him repeating the proposal.  And they&#x27;re  signed, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said Black-Tie gravely.  &quot;What&#x27;s your price for the  letters?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not a cheap one,&quot; said Miss De Ormond.  &quot;But I had decided to  make you a rate.  You both belong to a swell family.  Well, if I am on  the stage nobody can say a word against me truthfully.  And the money  is only a secondary consideration.  It isn&#x27;t the money I was after.   I--I believed him--and--and I liked him.&quot;</p>
<p>She cast a soft, entrancing glance at Blue-Tie from under her long  eyelashes.</p>
<p>&quot;And the price?&quot; went on Black-Tie, inexorably.</p>
<p>&quot;Ten thousand dollars,&quot; said the lady, sweetly.</p>
<p>&quot;Or--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or the fulfillment of the engagement to marry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is time,&quot; interrupted Blue-Tie, &quot;for me to be allowed to  say a word or two.  You and I, cousin, belong to a family that has  held its head pretty high.  You have been brought up in a section of  the country very different from the one where our branch of the family  lived.  Yet both of us are Carterets, even if some of our ways and  theories differ.  You remember, it is a tradition of the family, that  no Carteret ever failed in chivalry to a lady or failed to keep his  word when it was given.&quot;</p>
<p>Then Blue-Tie, with frank decision showing on his countenance, turned  to Miss De Ormond.</p>
<p>&quot;Olivia,&quot; said he, &quot;on what date will you marry me?&quot;</p>
<p>Before she could answer, Black-Tie again interposed.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a long journey,&quot; said he, &quot;from Plymouth rock to Norfolk Bay.   Between the two points we find the changes that nearly three centuries  have brought.  In that time the old order has changed.  We no longer  burn witches or torture slaves.  And to-day we neither spread our  cloaks on the mud for ladies to walk over nor treat them to the  ducking-stool.  It is the age of common sense, adjustment, and  proportion.  All of us--ladies, gentlemen, women, men, Northerners,  Southerners, lords, caitiffs, actors, hardware-drummers, senators,  hodcarriers, and politicians--are coming to a better understanding.   Chivalry is one of our words that changes its meaning every day.   Family pride is a thing of many constructions--it may show itself by  maintaining a moth-eaten arrogance in cobwebbed Colonial mansion or by  the prompt paying of one&#x27;s debts.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, I suppose you&#x27;ve had enough of my monologue.  I&#x27;ve learned  something of business and a little of life; and I somehow believe,  cousin, that our great-great-grandfathers, the original Carterets,  would indorse my view of this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>Black-Tie wheeled around to his desk, wrote in a check-book and tore  out the check, the sharp rasp of the perforated leaf making the only  sound in the room.  He laid the check within easy reach of Miss De  Ormond&#x27;s hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Business is business,&quot; said he.  &quot;We live in a business age.  There  is my personal check for $10,000.  What do you say, Miss De Ormond-- will it he orange blossoms or cash ?&quot;</p>
<p>Miss De Ormond picked up the cheek carelessly, folded it  indifferently, and stuffed it into her glove.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, this &#x27;11 do,&quot; she said, calmly.  &quot;I just thought I&#x27;d call and put  it up to you.  I guess you people are all right.  But a girl has  feelings, you know.  I&#x27;ve heard one of you was a Southerner--I wonder  which one of you it is?&quot;</p>
<p>She arose, smiled sweetly, and walked to the door.  There, with a  flash of white teeth and a dip of the heavy plume, she disappeared.</p>
<p>Both of the cousins had forgotten Uncle Jake for the time.  But now  they heard the shuffling of his shoes as he came across the rug toward  them from his seat in the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Young marster,&quot; he said, &quot;take yo&#x27; watch.&quot;  And without hesitation he  laid the ancient timepiece in the hand of its rightful owner.</p>
<p>Finch keeps a hats-cleaned-by-electricity-while-you-wait  establishment, nine feet by twelve, in Third Avenue.  Once a customer,  you are always his.  I do not know his secret process, but every four  days your hat needs to be cleaned again.</p>
<p>Finch is a leathern, sallow, slowfooted man, between twenty and forty.   You would say he had been brought up a bushelman in Essex Street.   When business is slack he likes to talk, so I had my hat cleaned even  oftener than it deserved, hoping Finch might let me into some of the  secrets of the sweatshops.</p>
<p>One afternoon I dropped in and found Finch alone.  He began to anoint  my headpiece de Panama with his mysterious fluid that attracted dust  and dirt like a magnet.</p>
<p>&quot;They say the Indians weave &#x27;em under water,&quot; said I, for a leader.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you believe it,&quot; said Finch.  &quot;No Indian or white man could  stay under water that long.  Say, do you pay much attention to  politics?  I see in the paper something about a law they&#x27;ve passed  called &#x27;the law of supply and demand.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>I explained to him as well as I could that the reference was to a  politico-economical law, and not to a legal statute.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t know,&quot; said Finch.  &quot;I heard a good deal about it a year or  so ago, but in a one-sided way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said I, &quot;political orators use it a great deal.  In fact, they  never give it a rest.  I suppose you heard some of those cart-tail  fellows spouting on the subject over here on the east side.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I heard it from a king,&quot; said Finch--&quot;the white king of a tribe of  Indians in South America.&quot;</p>
<p>I was interested but not surprised.  The big city is like a mother&#x27;s  knee to many who have strayed far and found the roads rough beneath  their uncertain feet.  At dusk they come home and sit upon the door- step.  I know a piano player in a cheap cafe who has shot lions in  Africa, a bell-boy who fought in the British army against the Zulus,  an express-driver whose left arm had been cracked like a lobster&#x27;s  claw for a stew-pot of Patagonian cannibals when the boat of his  rescuers hove in sight.  So a hat-cleaner who had been a friend of a  king did not oppress me.</p>
<p>&quot;A new band ?&quot; asked Finch, with his dry, barren smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said I, &quot;and half an inch wider.&quot;  I had had a new band five  days before.</p>
<p>&quot;I meets a man one night,&quot; said Finch, beginning his story--&quot;a man  brown as snuff, with money in every pocket, eating schweinerknuckel in  Schlagel&#x27;s.  That was two years ago, when I was a hose-cart driver for  No.  98.  His discourse runs to the subject of gold.  He says that  certain mountains in a country down South that he calls Gaudymala is  full of it.  He says the Indians wash it out of the streams in plural  quantities.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh, Geronimo!&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Indians! There&#x27;s no Indians in the South,&#x27;  I tell him, &#x27;except Elks, Maccabees, and the buyers for the fall dry- goods trade.  The Indians are all on the reservations,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m telling you this with reservations,&#x27; says he.  &#x27;They ain&#x27;t  Buffalo Bill Indians; they&#x27;re squattier and more pedigreed.  They call  &#x27;em Inkers and Aspics, and they was old inhabitants when Mazuma was  King of Mexico.  They wash the gold out of the mountain streams,&#x27; says  the brown man, &#x27;and fill quills with it; and then they empty &#x27;em into  red jars till they are full; and then they pack it in buckskin sacks  of one arroba each--an arroba is twenty-five pounds--and store it in a  stone house, with an engraving of a idol with marcelled hair, playing  a flute, over the door.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;how do they work off this unearth increment?&#x27; I asks.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They don&#x27;t,&#x27; says the man.  &#x27;It&#x27;s a case of &quot;Ill fares the land with  the great deal of velocity where wealth accumulates and there ain&#x27;t  any reciprocity.&quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;After this man and me got through our conversation, which left him  dry of information, I shook hands with him and told him I was sorry I  couldn&#x27;t believe him.  And a month afterward I landed on the coast of  this Gaudymala with $1,300 that I had been saving up for five years.   I thought I knew what Indians liked, and I fixed myself accordingly.   I loaded down four pack-mules with red woollen blankets, wrought-iron  pails, jewelled side-combs for the ladies, glass necklaces, and  safety-razors.  I hired a black mozo, who was supposed to be a mule- driver and an interpreter too.  It turned out that he could interpret  mules all right, but he drove the English language much too hard.  His  name sounded like a Yale key when you push it in wrong side up, but I  called him McClintock, which was close to the noise.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this gold village was forty miles up in the mountains, and it  took us nine days to find it.  But one afternoon McClintock led the  other mules and myself over a rawhide bridge stretched across a  precipice five thousand feet deep, it seemed to me.  The hoofs of the  beasts drummed on it just like before George M.  Cohan makes his first  entrance on the stage.</p>
<p>&quot;This village was built of mud and stone, and had no streets.  Some  few yellow-and-brown persons popped their heads out-of-doors, looking  about like Welsh rabbits with Worcester sauce on em.  Out of the  biggest house, that had a kind of a porch around it, steps a big white  man, red as a beet in color, dressed in fine tanned deerskin clothes,  with a gold chain around his neck, smoking a cigar.  I&#x27;ve seen United  States Senators of his style of features and build, also head-waiters  and cops.</p>
<p>&quot;He walks up and takes a look at us, while McClintock disembarks and  begins to interpret to the lead mule while he smokes a cigarette.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Hello, Buttinsky,&#x27; says the fine man to me.  &#x27;How did you get in the  game?  I didn&#x27;t see you buy any chips.  Who gave you the keys of the  city?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m a poor traveller,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Especially mule-back.  You&#x27;ll  excuse me.  Do you run a hack line or only a bluff?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Segregate yourself from your pseudo-equine quadruped,&#x27; says he, &#x27;and  come inside.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;He raises a finger, and a villager runs up.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;This man will take care of your outfit,&#x27; says he, &#x27;and I&#x27;ll take  care of you.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;He leads me into the biggest house, and sets out the chairs and a  kind of a drink the color of milk.  It was the finest room I ever saw.   The stone walls was hung all over with silk shawls, and there was red  and yellow rugs on the floor, and jars of red pottery and Angora goat  skins, and enough bamboo furniture to misfurnish half a dozen seaside  cottages.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;In the first place,&#x27; says the man, &#x27;you want to know who I am.  I&#x27;m  sole lessee and proprietor of this tribe of Indians.  They call me the  Grand Yacuma, which is to say King or Main Finger of the bunch.  I&#x27;ve  got more power here than a charge d&#x27;affaires, a charge of dynamite,  and a charge account at Tiffany&#x27;s combined.  In fact, I&#x27;m the Big  Stick, with as many extra knots on it as there is on the record run of  the Lusitania.  Oh, I read the papers now and then,&#x27; says he.  &#x27;Now,  let&#x27;s hear your entitlements,&#x27; he goes on, &#x27;and the meeting will be  open.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well,&#x27; says I, &#x27;I am known as one W.  D.  Finch.  Occupation,  capitalist.  Address, 54&#x27; East Thirty-second--&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;New York,&#x27; chips in the Noble Grand.  &#x27;I know,&#x27; says he, grinning.   &#x27;It ain&#x27;t the first time you&#x27;ve seen it go down on the blotter.  I can  tell by the way you hand it out.  Well, explain &quot;capitalist.&quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I tells this boss plain what I come for and how I come to came.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Gold-dust ?&#x27; says he, looking as puzzled as a baby that&#x27;s got a  feather stuck on its molasses finger.  &#x27;That&#x27;s funny.  This ain&#x27;t a  gold-mining country.  And you invested all your capital on a  stranger&#x27;s story?  Well, well!  These Indians of mine--they are the  last of the tribe of Peehes--are simple as children.  They know  nothing of the purchasing power of gold.  I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ve been  imposed on,&#x27; says he.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Maybe so,&#x27; says I, &#x27;but it sounded pretty straight to me.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;W.  D.,&#x27; says the King, all of a sudden, &#x27;I&#x27;ll give you a square  deal.  It ain&#x27;t often I get to talk to a white man, and I&#x27;ll give you  a show for your money.  It may be these constituents of mine have a  few grains of gold-dust hid away in their clothes.  To-morrow you may  get out these goods you&#x27;ve brought up and see if you can make any  sales.  Now, I&#x27;m going to introduce myself unofficially.  My name is  Shane--Patrick Shane.  I own this tribe of Peche Indians by right of  conquest--single handed and unafraid.  I drifted up here four years  ago, and won &#x27;em by my size and complexion and nerve.  I learned their  language in six weeks-it&#x27;s easy: you simply emit a string of  consonants as long as your breath holds out and then point at what  you&#x27;re asking for.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I conquered &#x27;em, spectacularly,&#x27; goes on King Shane, &#x27;and then I  went at &#x27;em with economical politics, law, sleight-of-hand, and a kind  of New England ethics and parsimony.  Every Sunday, or as near as I  can guess at it, I preach to &#x27;em in the council-house (I&#x27;m the  council) on the law of supply and demand.  I praise supply and knock  demand.  I use the same text every time.  You wouldn&#x27;t think, W.  D.,&#x27;  says Shane, &#x27;that I had poetry in me, would you?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well,&#x27; says I, &#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t know whether to call it poetry or not.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tennyson,&#x27; says Shane,  &#x27;furnishes the poetic gospel I preach.  I  always considered him the boss poet.  Here&#x27;s the way the text goes:</p>
<p>&quot;For, not to admire, if a man could learn it, were more Than to walk all day like a Sultan of old in a garden of spice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You see, I teach &#x27;em to cut out demand--that supply is the main  thing.  I teach &#x27;em not to desire anything beyond their simplest  needs.  A little mutton, a little cocoa, and a little fruit brought up  from the coast--that&#x27;s all they want to make &#x27;cm happy.  I&#x27;ve got &#x27;em  well trained.  They make their own clothes and hats out of a vegetable  fibre and straw, and they&#x27;re a contented lot.  It&#x27;s a great thing,&#x27;  winds up Shane, &#x27;to have made a people happy by the incultivation of  such simple institutions.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the next day, with the King&#x27;s permission, I has the McClintock  open up a couple of sacks of my goods in the little plaza of the  village.  The Indians swarmed around by the hundred and looked the  bargain-counter over.  I shook red blankets at &#x27;em, flashed finger- rings and ear-bobs, tried pearl necklaces and sidecombs on the women,  and a line of red hosiery on the men.  &#x27;Twas no use.  They looked on  like hungry graven images, but I never made a sale.  I asked  McClintock what was the trouble.  Mac yawned three or four times,  rolled a cigarette, made one or two confidential side remarks to a  mule, and then condescended to inform me that the people had no money.</p>
<p>&quot;Just then up strolls King Patrick, big and red &#x27;and royal as usual,  with the gold chain over his chest and his cigar in front of him.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;How&#x27;s business, W.  D.?&#x27; he asks.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Fine,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;It&#x27;s a bargain-day rush.  I&#x27;ve got one more line of  goods to offer before I shut up shop.  I&#x27;ll try &#x27;em with safety- razors.  I&#x27;ve&#x27; got two gross that I bought at &#x27;a fire sale.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Shane laughs till some kind of mameluke or private secretary he  carries with him has to hold him up.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;0 my sainted Aunt Jerusha!&#x27; says he, &#x27;ain&#x27;t you one of the Babes in  the Goods, W.  D.?  Don&#x27;t you know that no Indians ever shave? They  pull out their whiskers instead.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well,&#x27; says I, &#x27;that&#x27;s just what these razors would do for &#x27;em--they  wouldn&#x27;t have any kick coming if they used &#x27;em once.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Shane went away, and I could hear him laughing a block, if there had  been any block.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tell &#x27;em,&#x27; says I to McClintock, &#x27;it ain&#x27;t money I want--tell &#x27;em  I&#x27;ll take gold-dust.  Tell &#x27;em I&#x27;ll allow &#x27;em sixteen dollars an ounce  for it in trade.  That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m out for--the dust.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Mac interprets, and you&#x27;d have thought a squadron of cops had charged  the crowd to disperse it.  Every uncle&#x27;s nephew and aunt&#x27;s niece of  &#x27;em faded away inside of two minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;At the royal palace that night me and the King talked it over.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They&#x27;ve got the dust hid out somewhere,&#x27; says I, &#x27;or they wouldn&#x27;t  have been so sensitive about it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They haven&#x27;t,&#x27; says Shane.  &#x27;What&#x27;s this gag you&#x27;ve got about gold?   You been reading Edward Allen Poe?  They ain&#x27;t got any gold.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They put it in quills,&#x27; says I, &#x27;and then they empty it in jars, and  then into sacks of twenty-five pounds each.  I got it straight.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;W.  D.,&#x27; says Shane, laughing and chewing his cigar, &#x27;I don&#x27;t often  see a white man, and I feel like putting you on.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll  get away from here alive, anyhow, so I&#x27;m going to tell you.  Come over  here.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;&#x27;He draws aside a silk fibre curtain in a corner of the room and  shows me a pile of buckskin sacks.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Forty of &#x27;em,&#x27; says Shane.  &#x27;One arroba in each one.  In round  numbers, $220,000 worth of gold-dust you see there.  It&#x27;s all mine.   It belongs to the Grand Yacuma.  They bring it all to me.  Two hundred  and twenty thousand dollars--think of that, you glass-bead peddler,&#x27;  says Shane--&#x27; and all mine.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Little good it does you,&#x27; says I, contemptuously and hatefully.   &#x27;And so you are the government depository of this gang of money-less  money-makers?  Don&#x27;t you pay enough interest on it to enable one of  your depositors to buy an Augusta (Maine) Pullman carbon diamond worth  $200 for $4.85 ?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Listen,&#x27; says Patrick Shane, with the sweat coming out on his brow.   &#x27; I&#x27;m confidant with you, as you have, somehow, enlisted my regards.   Did you ever,&#x27; he says, &#x27;feel the avoirdupois power of gold--not the  troy weight of it, but the sixteen-ounces-to-the-pound force of it?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Never,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I never take in any bad money.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Shane drops down on the floor and throws his arms over the sacks of  gold-dust.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I love it,, says he.  &#x27;I want to feel the touch of it day and night.   It&#x27;s my pleasure in life.  I come in this room, and I&#x27;m a king and a  rich man.  I&#x27;ll be a millionaire in another year.  The pile&#x27;s getting  bigger every month.  I&#x27;ve got the whole tribe washing out the sands in  the creeks.  I&#x27;m the happiest man in the world, W.  D.  I just want to  be near this gold, and know it&#x27;s mine and it&#x27;s increasing every day.   Now, you know,&#x27; says he, &#x27;why my Indians wouldn&#x27;t buy your goods.   They can&#x27;t.  They bring all the dust to me.  I&#x27;m their king.  I&#x27;ve  taught &#x27;em not to desire or admire.  You might as well shut up shop.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;ll tell you what you are,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;You&#x27;re a plain, contemptible  miser.  You preach supply and you forget demand.  Now, supply,&#x27; I goes  on, &#x27;is never anything but supply.  On the contrary,&#x27; says I, &#x27;demand  is a much broader syllogism and assertion.  Demand includes the rights  of our women and children, and charity and friendship, and even a  little begging on the street corners.  They&#x27;ve both got to harmonize  equally.  And I&#x27;ve got a few things up my commercial sleeve yet,&#x27; says  I, &#x27;that may jostle your preconceived ideas of politics and economy.</p>
<p>&quot;The next morning I had McClintock bring tip another mule-load of  goods to the plaza and open it up.  The people gathered around the  same as before.</p>
<p>&quot;I got out the finest line of necklaces, bracelets, hair-combs, and  earrings that I carried, and had the women put &#x27;em on.  And then I  played trumps.</p>
<p>&quot;Out of my last pack I opened up a half gross of hand-mirrors, with  solid tinfoil backs, and passed &#x27;em around among the ladies.  That was  the first introduction of looking-glasses among the Peche Indians.</p>
<p>&quot;Shane walks by with his big laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Business looking up any?&#x27; he asks.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s looking at itself right now,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;By-and-by a kind of a murmur goes through the crowd.  The women had  looked into the magic crystal and seen that they were beautiful, and  was confiding the secret to the men.  The men seemed to be urging the  lack of money and the hard times just before the election, but their  excuses didn&#x27;t go.</p>
<p>&quot;Then was my time.</p>
<p>&quot;I called McClintock away from an animated conversation with his mules  and told him to do some interpreting.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tell &#x27;em,&#x27; says I, &#x27;that gold-dust will buy for them these befitting  ornaments for kings and queens of the earth.  Tell &#x27;em the yellow sand  they wash out of the waters for the High Sanctified Yacomay and Chop  Suey of the tribe will buy the precious jewels and charms that will  make them beautiful and preserve and pickle them from evil spirits.   Tell &#x27;em the Pittsburg banks are paying four per cent.  interest on  deposits by mail, while this get-rich-frequently custodian of the  public funds ain&#x27;t even paying attention.  Keep telling &#x27;em, Mac,&#x27;  says I, &#x27;to let the gold-dust family do their work.  Talk to &#x27;em like  a born anti-Bryanite,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Remind &#x27;em that Tom Watson&#x27;s gone  back to Georgia,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;McClintock waves his hand affectionately at one of his mules, and  then hurls a few stickfuls of minion type at the mob of shoppers.</p>
<p>&quot;A gutta-percha Indian man, with a lady hanging on his arm, with three  strings of my fish-scale jewelry and imitation marble beads around her  neck, stands up on a block of stone and makes a talk that sounds like  a man shaking dice in a box to fill aces and sixes.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;He says,&#x27; says McClintock, &#x27;that the people not know that gold-dust  will buy their things.  The women very mad.  The Grand Yacuma tell  them it no good but for keep to make bad spirits keep away.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You can&#x27;t keep bad spirits away from money,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They say,&#x27; goes on McClintock, &#x27;the Yacuma fool them.  They raise  plenty row.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Going! Going!&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Gold-dust or cash takes the entire stock.   The dust weighed before you, and taken at sixteen dollars the ounce-- the highest price on the Gaudymala coast.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Then the crowd disperses all of a sudden, and I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up.   Mac and me packs away the hand-mirrors and jewelry they had handed  back to us, and we had the mules back to the corral they had set apart  for our garage.</p>
<p>&quot;While we was there we hear great noises of shouting, and down across  the plaza runs Patrick Shane, hotfoot, with his clothes ripped half  off, and scratches on his face like a cat had fought him hard for  every one of its lives.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They&#x27;re looting the treasury, W.  D.,&#x27; he sings out.  &#x27;They&#x27;re going  to kill me and you, too.  Unlimber a couple of mules at once.  We&#x27;ll  have to make a get-away in a couple of minutes.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They&#x27;ve found out,&#x27; says I,&#x27; the truth about the law of supply and  demand.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s the women, mostly,&#x27; says the King.  &#x27;And they used to admire me  so!&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They hadn&#x27;t seen looking-glasses then,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;They&#x27;ve got knives and hatchets,&#x27; says Shane; &#x27;hurry !&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Take that roan mule,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;You and your law of supply!  I&#x27;ll  ride the dun, for he&#x27;s two knots per hour the faster.  The roan has a  stiff knee, but he may make it,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;If you&#x27;d included  reciprocity in your political platform I might have given you the  dun,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;Shane and McClintock and me mounted our mules and rode across the  rawhide bridge just as the Peches reached the other side and began  firing stones and long knives at us.  We cut the thongs that held up  our end of the bridge and headed for the coast.&quot;</p>
<p>A tall, bulky policeman came into Finch&#x27;s shop at that moment and leaned an elbow on the showcase.  Finch nodded  at him friendly.</p>
<p>&quot;I heard down at Casey&#x27;s,&quot; said the cop, in rumbling, husky tones,  &quot;that there was going to be a picnic of the Hat-Cleaners&#x27; Union over  at Bergen Beach, Sunday.  Is that right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; said Finch.  &quot;There&#x27;ll be a dandy time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gimme five tickets,&quot; said the cop, throwing a five-dollar bill on the  showcase.</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&#x27;&#x27; said Finch, &quot;ain&#x27;t you going it a little too--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go to h--!&quot; said the cop.  &quot;You got &#x27;em to sell, ain&#x27;t you?   Somebody&#x27;s got to buy &#x27;em.  Wish I could go along.&quot;</p>
<p>I was glad to See Finch so well thought of in his neighborhood.</p>
<p>And then in came a wee girl of seven, with dirty face and pure blue  eyes and a smutched and insufficient dress.</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma says,&quot; she recited shrilly, &quot;that you must give me eighty cents  for the grocer and nineteen for the milkman and five cents for me to  buy hokey-pokey with--but she didn&#x27;t say that,&quot; the elf concluded,  with a hopeful but honest grin.</p>
<p>Finch shelled out the money, counting it twice, but I noticed that the  total sum that the small girl received was one dollar and four cents.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the right kind of a law,&quot; remarked Finch, as he carefully  broke some of the stitches of my hatband so that it would assuredly  come off within a few days--&quot;the law of supply and demand.  But  they&#x27;ve both got to work together.  I&#x27;ll bet,&quot; he went on, with his  dry smile, &quot;she&#x27;ll get jelly beans with that nickel--she likes &#x27;em.   What&#x27;s supply if there&#x27;s no demand for it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What ever became of the King?&quot; I asked, curiously. &#x27;&#x27;Oh, I might have told you,&quot; said Finch.  &quot;That was Shane came in and  bought the tickets.  He came back with me, and he&#x27;s on the force now.&quot;</p>
<p>BURIED TREASURE</p>
<p>There are many kinds of fools.  Now, will everybody please sit still  until they are called upon specifically to rise?</p>
<p>I had been every kind of fool except one.  I had expended my  patrimony, pretended my matrimony, played poker, lawn-tennis, and  bucket-shops--parted soon with my money in many ways.  But there  remained one rule of the wearer of cap and bells that I had not  played.  That was the Seeker after Buried Treasure.  To few does the  delectable furor come.  But of all the would-be followers in the hoof- prints of King Midas none has found a pursuit so rich in pleasurable  promise.</p>
<p>But, going back from my theme a while--as lame pens must do--I was a  fool of the sentimental soft.  I saw May Martha Mangum, and was hers.   She was eighteen, the color of the white ivory keys of a new piano,  beautiful, and possessed by the exquisite solemnity and pathetic  witchery of an unsophisticated angel doomed to live in a small, dull,  Texas prairie-town.  She had a spirit and charm that could have  enabled her to pluck rubies like raspberries from the crown of Belgium  or any other sporty kingdom, but she did not know it, and I did not  paint the picture for her.</p>
<p>You see, I wanted May Martha Mangum for to have and to hold.  I wanted  her to abide with me, and put my slippers and pipe away every day in  places where they cannot be found of evenings.</p>
<p>May Martha&#x27;s father was a man hidden behind whiskers and spectacles.   He lived for bugs and butterflies and all insects that fly or crawl or  buzz or get down your back or in the butter.  He was an etymologist,  or words to that effect.  He spent his life seining the air for flying  fish of the June-bug order, and then sticking pins through &#x27;em and  calling &#x27;em names.</p>
<p>He and May Martha were the whole family.  He prized her highly as a  fine specimen of the racibus humanus because she saw that he had food  at times, and put his clothes on right side before, and kept his  alcohol-bottles filled.  Scientists, they say, are apt to be absent- minded.</p>
<p>There was another besides myself who thought May Martha Mangum one to  be desired.  That was Goodloe Banks, a young man just home from  college.  He had all the attainments to be found in books--Latin,  Greek, philosophy, and especially the higher branches of mathematics  and logic.</p>
<p>If it hadn&#x27;t been for his habit of pouring out this information and  learning on every one that he addressed, I&#x27;d have liked him pretty  well.  But, even as it was, he and I were, you would have thought,  great pals.</p>
<p>We got together every time we could because each of us wanted to pump  the other for whatever straws we could to find which way the wind blew  from the heart of May Martha Mangum--rather a mixed metaphor; Goodloe  Banks would never have been guilty of that.  That is the way of  rivals.</p>
<p>You might say that Goodloe ran to books, manners, culture, rowing,  intellect, and clothes.  I would have put you in mind more of baseball  and Friday-night debating societies--by way of culture--and maybe of a  good horseback rider.</p>
<p>But in our talks together, and in our visits and conversation with May  Martha, neither Goodloe Banks nor I could find out which one of us she  preferred.  May Martha was a natural-born non-committal, and knew in  her cradle how to keep people guessing.</p>
<p>As I said, old man Mangum was absentminded.  After a long time he  found out one day--a little butterfly must have told him-that two  young men were trying to throw a net over the head of the young  person, a daughter, or some such technical appendage, who looked after  his comforts.</p>
<p>I never knew scientists could rise to such occasions.  Old Mangum  orally labelled and classified Goodloe and myself easily among the  lowest orders of the vertebrates; and in English, too, without going  any further into Latin than the simple references to Orgetorix, Rex  Helvetii--which is as far as I ever went, myself.  And he told us that  if he ever caught us around his house again he would add us to his  collection.</p>
<p>Goodloe Banks and I remained away five days, expecting the storm to  subside.  When we dared to call at the house again May Martha Mangum  and her father were gone.  Gone!  The house they had rented was  closed.  Their little store of goods and chattels was gone also.</p>
<p>And not a word of farewell to either of us from May Martha--not a  white, fluttering note pinned to the hawthorn-bush; not a chalk-mark  on the gate-post nor a post-card in the post-office to give us a clew.</p>
<p>For two months Goodloe Banks and I--separately--tried every scheme we  could think of to track the runaways.  We used our friendship and  influence with the ticket-agent, with livery-stable men, railroad  conductors, and our one lone, lorn constable, but without results.</p>
<p>Then we became better friends and worse enemies than ever.  We  forgathered in the back room of Snyder&#x27;s saloon every afternoon after  work, and played dominoes, and laid conversational traps to find out  from each other if anything had been discovered.  That is the way of  rivals.</p>
<p>Now, Goodloe Banks had a sarcastic way of displaying his own learning  and putting me in the class that was reading &quot;Poor Jane Ray, her bird  is dead, she cannot play.&quot;  Well, I rather liked Goodloe, and I had a  contempt for his college learning, and I was always regarded as good- natured, so I kept my temper.  And I was trying to find out if he knew  anything about May Martha, so I endured his society.</p>
<p>In talking things over one afternoon he said to me:</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose you do find her, Ed, whereby would you profit?  Miss Mangum  has a mind.  Perhaps it is yet uncultured, but she is destined for  higher things than you could give her.  I have talked with no one who  seemed to appreciate more the enchantment of the ancient poets and  writers and the modern cults that have assimilated and expended their  philosophy of life.  Don&#x27;t you think you are wasting your time looking  for her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My idea,&quot; said I, &quot;of a happy home is an eight-room house in a grove  of live-oaks by the side of a charco on a Texas prairie.  A piano,&quot; I  went on, &quot;with an automatic player in the sitting-room, three thousand  head of cattle under fence for a starter, a buckboard and ponies  always hitched at a post for &#x27;the missus &#x27;--and May Martha Mangum to  spend the profits of the ranch as she pleases, and to abide with me,  and put my slippers and pipe away every day in places where they  cannot be found of evenings.  That,&quot; said I, &quot;is what is to be; and a  fig--a dried, Smyrna, dago-stand fig--for your curriculums, cults, and  philosophy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is meant for higher things,&quot; repeated Goodloe Banks.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever she is meant for,&quot; I answered, just now she is out of  pocket.  And I shall find her as soon as I can without aid of the  colleges.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The game is blocked,&quot; said Goodloe, putting down a domino and we had  the beer.</p>
<p>Shortly after that a young farmer whom I knew came into town and  brought me a folded blue paper.  He said his grandfather had just  died.  I concealed a tear, and he went on to say that the old man had  jealously guarded this paper for twenty years.  He left it to his  family as part of his estate, the rest of which consisted of two mules  and a hypotenuse of non-arable land.</p>
<p>The sheet of paper was of the old, blue kind used during the rebellion  of the abolitionists against the secessionists.  It was dated June 14,  1863, and it described the hiding-place of ten burro-loads of gold and  silver coin valued at three hundred thousand dollars.  Old Rundle-- grandfather of his grandson, Sam--was given the information by a  Spanish priest who was in on the treasure-burying, and who died many  years before--no, afterward--in old Rundle&#x27;s house.  Old Rundle wrote  it down from dictation.</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn&#x27;t your father look this up?&quot; I asked young Rundle.</p>
<p>&quot;He went blind before he could do so,&quot; he replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you hunt for it yourself?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;I&#x27;ve only known about the paper for ten years.   First there was the spring ploughin&#x27; to do, and then choppin&#x27; the  weeds out of the corn; and then come takin&#x27; fodder; and mighty soon  winter was on us.  It seemed to run along that way year after year.&quot;</p>
<p>That sounded perfectly reasonable to me, so I took it up with young  Lee Rundle at once.</p>
<p>The directions on the paper were simple.  The whole burro cavalcade  laden with the treasure started from an old Spanish mission in Dolores  County.  They travelled due south by the compass until they reached  the Alamito River.  They forded this, and buried the treasure on the  top of a little mountain shaped like a pack-saddle standing in a row  between two higher ones.  A heap of stones marked the place of the  buried treasure.  All the party except the Spanish priest were killed  by Indians a few days later.  The secret was a monopoly.  It looked  good to me.</p>
<p>Lee Rundle suggested that we rig out a camping outfit, hire a surveyor  to run out the line from the Spanish mission, and then spend the three  hundred thousand dollars seeing the sights in Fort Worth.  But,  without being highly educated, I knew a way to save time and expense.</p>
<p>We went to the State land-office and had a practical, what they call a  &quot;working,&quot; sketch made of all the surveys of land from the old mission  to the Alamito River.  On this map I drew a line due southward to the  river.  The length of lines of each survey and section of land was  accurately given on the sketch.  By these we found the point on the  river and had a &quot;connection&quot; made with it and an important, well- identified corner of the Los Animos five-league survey--a grant made  by King Philip of Spain.</p>
<p>By doing this we did not need to have the line run out by a surveyor.   It was a great saving of expense and time.</p>
<p>So, Lee Rundle and I fitted out a two-horse wagon team with all the  accessories, and drove a hundred and forty-nine miles to Chico, the  nearest town to the point we wished to reach.  There we picked up a  deputy county surveyor.  He found the corner of the Los Animos survey  for us, ran out the five thousand seven hundred and twenty varas west  that our sketch called for, laid a stone on the spot, had coffee and  bacon, and caught the mail-stage back to Chico.</p>
<p>I was pretty sure we would get that three hundred thousand dollars.   Lee Rundle&#x27;s was to be only one-third, because I was paying all the  expenses.  With that two hundred thousand dollars I knew I could find  May Martha Mangum if she was on earth.  And with it I could flutter  the butterflies in old man Mangum&#x27;s dove-cot, too.  If I could find  that treasure!</p>
<p>But Lee and I established camp.  Across the river were a dozen little  mountains densely covered by cedar-brakes, but not one shaped like a  pack-saddle.  That did not deter us.  Appearances are deceptive.  A  pack-saddle, like beauty, may exist only in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>I and the grandson of the treasure examined those cedar-covered hills  with the care of a lady hunting for the wicked flea.  We explored  every side, top, circumference, mean elevation, angle, slope, and  concavity of every one for two miles up and down the river.  We spent  four days doing so.  Then we hitched up the roan and the dun, and  hauled the remains of the coffee and bacon the one hundred and forty- nine miles back to Concho City.</p>
<p>Lee Rundle chewed much tobacco on the return trip.  I was busy  driving, because I was in a hurry.</p>
<p>As shortly as could be after our empty return Goodloe Banks and I  forgathered in the back room of Snyder&#x27;s saloon to play dominoes and  fish for information.  I told Goodloe about my expedition after the  buried treasure.</p>
<p>&quot;If I could have found that three hundred thousand dollars,&quot; I said to  him, &quot;I could have scoured and sifted the surface of the earth to find  May Martha Mangum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is meant for higher things,&quot; said Goodloe.  &quot;I shall find her  myself.  But, tell me how you went about discovering the spot where  this unearthed increment was imprudently buried.&quot;</p>
<p>I told him in the smallest detail.  I showed him the draughtsman&#x27;s  sketch with the distances marked plainly upon it.</p>
<p>After glancing over it in a masterly way, he leaned back in his chair  and bestowed upon me an explosion of sardonic, superior, collegiate  laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you are a fool, Jim,&quot; he said, when he could speak.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s your play,&quot; said I, patiently, fingering my double-six.</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty,&quot; said Goodloe, making two crosses on the table with his  chalk.</p>
<p>&quot;Why am I a fool?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Buried treasure has been found before in  many places.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because,&quot; said he, &quot;in calculating the point on the river where your  line would strike you neglected to allow for the variation.  The  variation there would be nine degrees west.  Let me have your pencil.&quot;</p>
<p>Goodloe Banks figured rapidly on the back of an envelope.</p>
<p>&quot;The distance, from north to south, of the line run from the Spanish  mission,&quot; said he, &quot;is exactly twenty-two miles.  It was run by a  pocket-compass, according to your story.  Allowing for the variation,  the point on the Alamito River where you should have searched for your  treasure is exactly six miles and nine hundred and forty-five varas  farther west than the place you hit upon.  Oh, what a fool you are,  Jim!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is this variation that you speak of?&quot; I asked.  &quot;I thought  figures never lied.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The variation of the magnetic compass,&quot; said Goodloe, &quot;from the true  meridian.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiled in his superior way; and then I saw come out in his face the  singular, eager, consuming cupidity of the seeker after buried  treasure.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; he said with the air of the oracle, &quot;these old traditions  of hidden money are not without foundation.  Suppose you let me look  over that paper describing the location.  Perhaps together we might--&quot;</p>
<p>The result was that Goodloe Banks and I, rivals in love, became  companions in adventure.  We went to Chico by stage from Huntersburg,  the nearest railroad town.  In Chico we hired a team drawing a covered  spring-wagon and camping paraphernalia.  We had the same surveyor run  out our distance, as revised by Goodloe and his variations, and then  dismissed him and sent him on his homeward road.</p>
<p>It was night when we arrived.  I fed the horses and made a fire near  the bank of the river and cooked supper.  Goodloe would have helped,  but his education had not fitted him for practical things.</p>
<p>But while I worked he cheered me with the expression of great thoughts  handed down from the dead ones of old.  He quoted some translations  from the Greek at much length.</p>
<p>&quot;Anacreon,&quot; he explained.  &quot;That was a favorite passage with Miss  Mangum--as I recited it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is meant for higher things,&quot; said I, repeating his phrase.</p>
<p>&quot;Can there be anything higher,&quot; asked Goodloe, &quot;than to dwell in the  society of the classics, to live in the atmosphere of learning and  culture?  You have often decried education.  What of your wasted  efforts through your ignorance of simple mathematics?  How soon would  you have found your treasure if my knowledge had not shown you your  error?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll take a look at those hills across the river first,&quot; said I,  &quot;and see what we find.  I am still doubtful about variations.  I have  been brought up to believe that the needle is true to the pole.&quot;</p>
<p>The next morning was a bright June one.  We were up early and had  breakfast.  Goodloe was charmed.  He recited--Keats, I think it was,  and Kelly or Shelley--while I broiled the bacon.  We were getting  ready to cross the river, which was little more than a shallow creek  there, and explore the many sharp-peaked cedar-covered hills on the  other side.</p>
<p>&quot;My good Ulysses,&quot; said Goodloe, slapping me on the shoulder while I  was washing the tin breakfast-plates, &quot;let me see the enchanted  document once more.  I believe it gives directions for climbing the  hill shaped like a pack-saddle.  I never saw a pack-saddle.  What is  it like, Jim?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Score one against culture,&quot; said I.  &quot;I&#x27;ll know it when I see it.&quot;</p>
<p>Goodloe was looking at old Rundle&#x27;s document when he ripped out a most  uncollegiate swear-word.</p>
<p>&quot;Come here,&quot; he said, holding the paper up against the sunlight.   &quot;Look at that,&quot; he said, laying his finger against it.</p>
<p>On the blue paper--a thing I had never noticed before--I saw stand out  in white letters the word and figures : &quot;Malvern, 1898.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about it?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the water-mark,&quot; said Goodloe.  &quot;The paper was manufactured in  1898.  The writing on the paper is dated 1863.  This is a palpable  fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; said I.  &quot;The Rundles are pretty reliable, plain,  uneducated country people.  Maybe the paper manufacturers tried to  perpetrate a swindle.&quot;</p>
<p>And then Goodloe Banks went as wild as his education permitted.  He  dropped the glasses off his nose and glared at me.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve often told you you were a fool,&quot; he said.  &quot;You have let  yourself be imposed upon by a clodhopper.  And you have imposed upon  me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How,&quot; I asked, &quot;have I imposed upon you ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By your ignorance,&quot; said he.  &quot;Twice I have discovered serious flaws  in your plans that a common-school education should have enabled you  to avoid.  And,&quot; he continued, &quot;I have been put to expense that I  could ill afford in pursuing this swindling quest.  I am done with  it.&quot;</p>
<p>I rose and pointed a large pewter spoon at him, fresh from the dish- water.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodloe Banks,&quot; I said, &quot;I care not one parboiled navy bean for your  education.  I always barely tolerated it in any one, and I despised it  in you.  What has your learning done for you?  It is a curse to  yourself and a bore to your friends.  Away,&quot; I said--&quot;away with your  water-marks and variations!  They are nothing to me.  They shall not  deflect me from the quest.&quot;</p>
<p>I pointed with my spoon across the river to a small mountain shaped  like a pack-saddle.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to search that mountain,&quot; I went on, &quot;for the treasure.   Decide now whether you are in it or not.  If you wish to let a water- mark or a variation shake your soul, you are no true adventurer.   Decide.&quot;</p>
<p>A white cloud of dust began to rise far down the river road.  It was  the mail-wagon from Hesperus to Chico.  Goodloe flagged it.</p>
<p>&quot;I am done with the swindle,&quot; said he, sourly.  &quot;No one but a fool  would pay any attention to that paper now.  Well, you always were a  fool, Jim.  I leave you to your fate.&quot;</p>
<p>He gathered his personal traps, climbed into the mail-wagon, adjusted  his glasses nervously, and flew away in a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>After I had washed the dishes and staked the horses on new grass, I  crossed the shallow river and made my way slowly through the cedar- brakes up to the top of the hill shaped like a pack-saddle.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful June day.  Never in my life had I seen so many  birds, so many butter-flies, dragon-flies, grasshoppers, and such  winged and stinged beasts of the air and fields.</p>
<p>I investigated the hill shaped like a pack-saddle from base to summit.   I found an absolute absence of signs relating to buried treasure.   There was no pile of stones, no ancient blazes on the trees, none of  the evidences of the three hundred thousand dollars, as set forth in  the document of old man Rundle.</p>
<p>I came down the hill in the cool of the afternoon.  Suddenly, out of  the cedar-brake I stepped into a beautiful green valley where a  tributary small stream ran into the Alamito River.</p>
<p>And there I was started to see what I took to be a wild man, with  unkempt beard and ragged hair, pursuing a giant butterfly with  brilliant wings.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps he is an escaped madman,&quot; I thought; and wondered how he had  strayed so far from seats of education and learning.</p>
<p>And then I took a few more steps and saw a vine-covered cottage near  the small stream.  And in a little grassy glade I saw May Martha  Mangum plucking wild flowers.</p>
<p>She straightened up and looked at me.  For the first time since I knew  her I saw her face--which was the color of the white keys of a new  piano--turn pink.  I walked toward her without a word.  She let the  gathered flowers trickle slowly from her hand to the grass.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew you would come, Jim,&quot; she said clearly.  &quot;Father wouldn&#x27;t let  me write, but I knew you would come.</p>
<p>What followed you may guess--there was my wagon and team just across  the river.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve often wondered what good too much education is to a man if he  can&#x27;t use it for himself.  If all the benefits of it are to go to  others, where does it come in?</p>
<p>For May Martha Mangum abides with me.  There is an eight-room house in  a live-oak grove, and a piano with an automatic player, and a good  start toward the three thousand head of cattle is under fence.</p>
<p>And when I ride home at night my pipe and slippers are put away in  places where they cannot be found.</p>
<p>But who cares for that? Who cares--who cares?</p>
<p>TO HIM WHO WAITS</p>
<p>The Hermit of the Hudson was hustling about his cave with unusual  animation.</p>
<p>The cave was on or in the top of a little spur of the Catskills that  had strayed down to the river&#x27;s edge, and, not having a ferry ticket,  had to stop there.  The bijou mountains were densely wooded and were  infested by ferocious squirrels and woodpeckers that forever menaced  the summer transients.  Like a badly sewn strip of white braid, a  macadamized road ran between the green skirt of the hills and the  foamy lace of the river&#x27;s edge.  A dim path wound from the comfortable  road up a rocky height to the hermit&#x27;s cave.  One mile upstream was  the Viewpoint Inn, to which summer folk from the city came; leaving  cool, electric-fanned apartments that they might be driven about in  burning sunshine, shrieking, in gasoline launches, by spindle-legged  Modreds bearing the blankest of shields.</p>
<p>Train your lorgnette upon the hermit and let your eye receive the  personal touch that shall endear you to the hero.</p>
<p>A man of forty, judging him fairly, with long hair curling at the  ends, dramatic eyes, and a forked brown beard like those that were  imposed upon the West some years ago by self-appointed &quot;divine  healers&quot; who succeeded the grasshopper crop.  His outward vesture  appeared to be kind of gunny-sacking cut and made into a garment that  would have made the fortune of a London tailor.  His long, well-shaped  fingers, delicate nose, and poise of manner raised him high above the  class of hermits who fear water and bury money in oyster-cans in their  caves in spots indicated by rude crosses chipped in the stone wall  above.</p>
<p>The hermit&#x27;s home was not altogether a cave.  The cave was an addition  to the hermitage, which was a rude hut made of poles daubed with clay  and covered with the best quality of rust-proof zinc roofing.</p>
<p>In the house proper there were stone slabs for seats, a rustic  bookcase made of unplaned poplar planks, and a table formed of a  wooden slab laid across two upright pieces of granite--something  between the furniture of a Druid temple and that of a Broadway  beefsteak dungeon.  Hung against the walls were skins of wild animals  purchased in the vicinity of Eighth Street and University Place, New  York.</p>
<p>The rear of the cabin merged into the cave.  There the hermit cooked  his meals on a rude stone hearth.  With infinite patience and an old  axe he had chopped natural shelves in the rocky walls.  On them stood  his stores of flour, bacon, lard, talcum-powder, kerosene, baking- powder, soda-mint tablets, pepper, salt, and Olivo-Cremo Emulsion for  chaps and roughness of the hands and face.</p>
<p>The hermit had hermited there for ten years.  He was an asset of the  Viewpoint Inn.  To its guests he was second in interest only to the  Mysterious Echo in the Haunted Glen.  And the Lover&#x27;s Leap beat him  only a few inches, flat-footed.  He was known far (but not very wide,  on account of the topography) as a.  scholar of brilliant intellect  who had forsworn the world because he had been jilted in a love  affair.  Every Saturday night the Viewpoint Inn sent to him  surreptitiously a basket of provisions.  He never left the immediate  outskirts of his hermitage.  Guests of the inn who visited him said  his store of knowledge, wit, and scintillating philosophy were simply  wonderful, you know.</p>
<p>That summer the Viewpoint Inn was crowded with guests.  So, on  Saturday nights, there were extra cans of tomatoes, and sirloin steak,  instead of &quot;rounds,&quot; in the hermit&#x27;s basket.</p>
<p>Now you have the material allegations in the case.  So, make way for  Romance.</p>
<p>Evidently the hermit expected a visitor.  He carefully combed his long  hair and parted his apostolic beard.  When the ninety-eight-cent  alarm-clock on a stone shelf announced the hour of five he picked up  his gunny-sacking skirts, brushed them carefully, gathered an oaken  staff, and strolled slowly into the thick woods that surrounded the  hermitage.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait.  Up the faint pathway, slippery with its  carpet of pine-needles, toiled Beatrix, youngest and fairest of the  famous Trenholme sisters.  She was all in blue from hat to canvas  pumps, varying in tint from the shade of the tinkle of a bluebell at  daybreak on a spring Saturday to the deep hue of a Monday morning at  nine when the washer-woman has failed to show up.</p>
<p>Beatrix dug her cerulean parasol deep into the pine-needles and  sighed.  The hermit, on the q.  t., removed a grass burr from the  ankle of one sandalled foot with the big toe of his other one.</p>
<p>She blued--and almost starched and ironed him--with her cobalt eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be so nice,&quot; she said in little, tremulous gasps, &quot;to be a  hermit, and have ladies climb mountains to talk to you.&quot;</p>
<p>The hermit folded his arms and leaned against a tree.  Beatrix, with a  sigh, settled down upon the mat of pine-needles like a bluebird upon  her nest.  The hermit followed suit; drawing his feet rather awkwardly  under his gunny-sacking.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be nice to be a mountain,&quot; said he, with ponderous lightness,  &quot;and have angels in blue climb up you instead of flying over you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma had neuralgia,&quot; said Beatrix, &quot;and went to bed, or I couldn&#x27;t  have come.  It&#x27;s dreadfully hot at that horrid old inn.  But we hadn&#x27;t  the money to go anywhere else this summer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Last night,&quot; said the hermit, &quot;I climbed to the top of that big rock  above us.  I could see the lights of the inn and hear a strain or two  of the music when the wind was right.  I imagined you moving  gracefully in the arms of others to the dreamy music of the waltz amid  the fragrance of flowers.  Think how lonely I must have been!&quot;</p>
<p>The youngest, handsomest, and poorest of the famous Trenholme sisters  sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;You haven&#x27;t quite hit it,&quot; she said, plaintively.  &quot;I was moving  gracefully at the arms of another.  Mamma had one of her periodical  attacks of rheumatism in both elbows and shoulders, and I had to rub  them for an hour with that horrid old liniment.  I hope you didn&#x27;t  think that smelled like flowers.  You know, there were some West Point  boys and a yachtload of young men from the city at last evening&#x27;s  weekly dance.  I&#x27;ve known mamma to sit by an open window for three  hours with one-half of her registering 85 degrees and the other half  frostbitten, and never sneeze once.  But just let a bunch of  ineligibles come around where I am, and she&#x27;ll begin to swell at the  knuckles and shriek with pain.  And I have to take her to her room and  rub her arms.  To see mamma dressed you&#x27;d be surprised to know the  number of square inches of surface there are to her arms.  I think it  must be delightful to be a hermit.  That--cassock-- gabardine, isn&#x27;t  it?--that you wear is so becoming.  Do you make it--or them--of course  you must have changes- yourself?  And what a blessed relief it must be  to wear sandals instead of shoes!  Think how we must suffer--no matter  how small I buy my shoes they always pinch my toes.  Oh, why can&#x27;t  there be lady hermits, too!&quot;</p>
<p>The beautifulest and most adolescent Trenholme sister extended two  slender blue ankles that ended in two enormous blue-silk bows that  almost concealed two fairy Oxfords, also of one of the forty-seven  shades of blue.  The hermit, as if impelled by a kind of reflex- telepathic action, drew his bare toes farther beneath his gunny- sacking.</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard about the romance of your life,&quot; said Miss Trenholme,  softly.  &quot;They have it printed on the back of the menu card at the  inn.  Was she very beautiful and charming?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the bills of fare!&quot; muttered the hermit; &quot;but what do I care for  the world&#x27;s babble?  Yes, she was of the highest and grandest type.   Then,&quot; he continued, &quot;then I thought the world could never contain  another equal to her.  So I forsook it and repaired to this mountain  fastness to spend the remainder of my life alone--to devote and  dedicate my remaining years to her memory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s grand,&quot; said Miss Trenholme, &quot;absolutely grand.  I think a  hermit&#x27;s life is the ideal one.  No bill-collectors calling, no  dressing for dinner--how I&#x27;d like to be one!  But there&#x27;s no such luck  for me.  If I don&#x27;t marry this season I honestly believe mamma will  force me into settlement work or trimming hats.  It isn&#x27;t because I&#x27;m  getting old or ugly; but we haven&#x27;t enough money left to butt in at  any of the swell places any more.  And I don&#x27;t want to marry--unless  it&#x27;s somebody I like.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d like to be a hermit.  Hermits  don&#x27;t ever marry, do they ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hundreds of &#x27;em,&quot; said the hermit, &quot;when they&#x27;ve found the right  one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But they&#x27;re hermits,&quot; said the youngest and beautifulest, &quot;because  they&#x27;ve lost the right one, aren&#x27;t they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because they think they have,&quot; answered the recluse, fatuously.   &quot;Wisdom comes to one in a mountain cave as well as to one in the world  of &#x27;swells,&#x27; as I believe they are called in the argot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When one of the &#x27;swells&#x27; brings it to them,&quot; said Miss Trenholme.   &quot;And my folks are swells.  That&#x27;s the trouble.  But there are so many  swells at the seashore in the summer-time that we hardly amount to  more than ripples.  So we&#x27;ve had to put all our money into river and  harbor appropriations.  We were all girls, you know.  There were four  of us.  I&#x27;m the only surviving one.  The others have been married off.   All to money.  Mamma is so proud of my sisters.  They send her the  loveliest pen-wipers and art calendars every Christmas.  I&#x27;m the only  one on the market now.  I&#x27;m forbidden to look at any one who hasn&#x27;t  money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But--&quot; began the hermit.</p>
<p>&quot;But, oh,&quot; said the beautifulest &quot;of course hermits have great pots of  gold and doubloons buried somewhere near three great oak-trees.  They  all have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have not,&quot; said the hermit, regretfully.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m so sorry,&quot; said Miss Trenholme.  &quot;I always thought they had.  I  think I must go now.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, beyond question, she was the beautifulest.</p>
<p>&quot;Fair lady--&quot; began the hermit.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Beatrix Trenholme--some call me Trix,&quot; she said.  &quot;You must come  to the inn to see me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#x27;t been a stone&#x27;s--throw from my cave in ten years,&quot; said the  hermit.</p>
<p>&quot;You must come to see me there,&quot; she repeated.  &quot;Any evening except  Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p>The hermit smiled weakly.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said, gathering the folds of her pale-blue skirt.  &quot;I  shall expect you.  But not on Thursday evening, remember.&quot;</p>
<p>What an interest it would give to the future menu cards of the  Viewpoint Inn to have these printed lines added to them: &quot;Only once  during the more than ten years of his lonely existence did the  mountain hermit leave his famous cave.  That was when he was  irresistibly drawn to the inn by the fascinations of Miss Beatrix  Trenholme, youngest and most beautiful of the celebrated Trenholme  sisters, whose brilliant marriage to--&quot;</p>
<p>Aye, to whom?</p>
<p>The hermit walked back to the hermitage.  At the door stood Bob  Binkley, his old friend and companion of the days before he had  renounced the world--Bob, himself, arrayed like the orchids of the  greenhouse in the summer man&#x27;s polychromatic garb--Bob, the  millionaire, with his fat, firm, smooth, shrewd face, his diamond  rings, sparkling fob-chain, and pleated bosom.  He was two years older  than the hermit, and looked five years younger.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re Hamp Ellison, in spite of those whiskers and that going-away  bathrobe,&quot; he shouted.  &quot;I read about you on the bill of fare at the  inn.  They&#x27;ve run your biography in between the cheese and &#x27;Not  Responsible for Coats and Umbrellas.&#x27;  What &#x27;d you do it for, Hamp?   And ten years, too--geewhilikins!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re just the same,&quot; said the hermit.  &quot;Come in and sit down.  Sit  on that limestone rock over there; it&#x27;s softer than the granite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t understand it, old man,&quot; said Binkley.  &quot;I can see how you  could give up a woman for ten years, but not ten years for a woman.   Of course I know why you did it.  Everybody does.  Edith Carr.  She  jilted four or five besides you.  But you were the only one who took  to a hole in the ground.  The others had recourse to whiskey, the  Klondike, politics, and that similia similibus cure.  But, say--Hamp,  Edith Carr was just about the finest woman in the world--high-toned  and proud and noble, and playing her ideals to win at all kinds of  odds.  She certainly was a crackerjack.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After I renounced the world,&quot; said the hermit, &quot;I never heard of her  again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She married me,&quot; said Binkley.</p>
<p>The hermit leaned against the wooden walls of his ante-cave and  wriggled his toes.</p>
<p>&quot;I know how you feel about it,&quot; said Binkley.  &quot;What else could she  do?  There were her four sisters and her mother and old man Carr--you  remember how he put all the money he had into dirigible balloons?  Well,  everything was coming down and nothing going up with &#x27;em, as  you might say.  Well, I know Edith as well as you do--although I  married her.  I was worth a million then, but I&#x27;ve run it up since to  between five and six.  It wasn&#x27;t me she wanted as much as--well, it  was about like this.  She had that bunch on her hands, and they had to  be taken care of.  Edith married me two months after you did the  ground-squirrel act.  I thought she liked me, too, at the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And now?&quot; inquired the recluse.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re better friends than ever now.  She got a divorce from me two  years ago.  Just incompatibility.  I didn&#x27;t put in any defence.  Well,  well, well, Hamp, this is certainly a funny dugout you&#x27;ve built here.   But you always were a hero of fiction.  Seems like you&#x27;d have been the  very one to strike Edith&#x27;s fancy.  Maybe you did--but it&#x27;s the bank -  roll that catches &#x27;em, my boy--your caves and whiskers won&#x27;t do it.   Honestly, Hamp, don&#x27;t you think you&#x27;ve been a darned fool?&quot;</p>
<p>The hermit smiled behind his tangled beard.  He was and always had  been so superior to the crude and mercenary Binkley that even his  vulgarities could not anger him.  Moreover, his studies and  meditations in his retreat had raised him far above the little  vanities of the world.  His little mountain-side had been almost an  Olympus, over the edge of which he saw, smiling, the bolts hurled in  the valleys of man below.  Had his ten years of renunciation, of  thought, of devotion to an ideal, of living scorn of a sordid world,  been in vain?  Up from the world had come to him the youngest and  beautifulest--fairer than Edith--one and three-seventh times lovelier  than the seven-years-served Rachel.  So the hermit smiled in his  beard.</p>
<p>When Binkley had relieved the hermitage from the blot of his presence  and the first faint star showed above the pines, the hermit got the  can of baking-powder from his cupboard.  He still smiled behind his  beard.</p>
<p>There was a slight rustle in the doorway.  There stood Edith Carr,  with all the added beauty and stateliness and noble bearing that ten  years had brought her.</p>
<p>She was never one to chatter.  She looked at the hermit with her  large, thinking, dark eyes.  The hermit stood still, surprised into a  pose as motionless as her own.  Only his subconscious sense of the  fitness of things caused him to turn the baking-powder can slowly in  his hands until its red label was hidden against his bosom.</p>
<p>&quot;I am stopping at the inn,&quot; said Edith, in low but clear tones.  &quot;I  heard of you there.  I told myself that I must see you.  I want to ask  your forgiveness.  I sold my happiness for money.  There were others  to be provided for--but that does not excuse me.  I just wanted to see  you and ask your forgiveness.  You have lived here ten years, they  tell me, cherishing my memory!  I was blind, Hampton.  I could not see  then that all the money in the world cannot weigh in the scales  against a faithful heart.  If--but it is too late now, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>Her assertion was a question clothed as best it could be in a loving  woman&#x27;s pride.  But through the thin disguise the hermit saw easily  that his lady had come back to him--if he chose.  He had won a golden  crown--if it pleased him to take it.  The reward of his decade of  faithfulness was ready for his hand--if he desired to stretch it  forth.</p>
<p>For the space of one minute the old enchantment shone upon him with a  reflected radiance.  And then by turns he felt the manly sensations of  indignation at having been discarded, and of repugnance at having  been--as it were--sought again.  And last of all--how strange that it  should have come at last!--the pale-blue vision of the beautifulest of  the Trenholme sisters illuminated his mind&#x27;s eye and left him without  a waver.</p>
<p>&quot;It is too late,&quot; he said, in deep tones, pressing the baking-powder  can against his heart.</p>
<p>Once she turned after she had gone slowly twenty yards down the path.   The hermit had begun to twist the lid off his can, but he hid it again  under his sacking robe.  He could see her great eyes shining sadly  through the twilight; but he stood inflexible in the doorway of his  shack and made no sign.</p>
<p>Just as the moon rose on Thursday evening the hermit was seized by the  world-madness.</p>
<p>Up from the inn, fainter than the horns of elf-land, came now and then  a few bars of music played by the casino band.  The Hudson was  broadened by the night into an illimitable sea--those lights, dimly  seen on its opposite shore, were not beacons for prosaic trolley- lines, but low-set stars millions of miles away.  The waters in front  of the inn were gay with fireflies--or were they motor-boats, smelling  of gasoline and oil?  Once the hermit had known these things and had  sported with Amaryllis in the shade of the red-and-white-striped  awnings.  But for ten years he had turned a heedless ear to these far- off echoes of a frivolous world.  But to-night there was something  wrong.</p>
<p>The casino band was playing a waltz--a waltz.  What a fool he had been  to tear deliberately ten years of his life from the calendar of  existence for one who had given him up for the false joys that wealth- -&quot;tum ti tum ti tum ti&quot;--how did that waltz go?  But those years had  not been sacrificed--had they not brought him the star and pearl of  all the world, the youngest and beautifulest of-- &quot;But do not come on Thursday evening,&quot; she had insisted.  Perhaps by  now she would be moving slowly and gracefully to the strains of that  waltz, held closely by West-Pointers or city commuters, while he, who  had read in her eyes things that had recompensed him for ten lost  years of life, moped like some wild animal in its mountain den.  Why  should--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damn it,&quot; said the hermit, suddenly, &quot;I&#x27;ll do it!&quot;</p>
<p>He threw down his Marcus Aurelius and threw off his gunny-sack toga.   he dragged a dust-covered trunk from a corner of the cave, and with  difficulty wrenched open its lid.</p>
<p>Candles he had in plenty, and the cave was soon aglow.  Clothes--ten  years old in cut--scissors, razors, hats, shoes, all his discarded  attire and belongings, were dragged ruthlessly from their renunciatory  rest and strewn about in painful disorder.</p>
<p>A pair of scissors soon reduced his beard sufficiently for the dulled  razors to perform approximately their office.  Cutting his own hair  was beyond the hermit&#x27;s skill.  So he only combed and brushed it  backward as smoothly as he could.  Charity forbids us to consider the  heartburnings and exertions of one so long removed from haberdashery  and society.</p>
<p>At the last the hermit went to an inner corner of his cave and began  to dig in the soft earth with a long iron spoon.  Out of the cavity he  thus made he drew a tin can, and out of the can three thousand dollars  in bills, tightly rolled and wrapped in oiled silk.  He was a real  hermit, as this may assure you.</p>
<p>You may take a brief look at him as he hastens down the little  mountain-side.  A long, wrinkled black frock-coat reached to his  calves.  White duck trousers, unacquainted with the tailor&#x27;s goose, a  pink shirt, white standing collar with brilliant blue butterfly tie,  and buttoned congress gaiters.  But think, sir and madam--ten years!   &gt;From beneath a narrow-brimmed straw hat with a striped band flowed his  hair.  Seeing him, with all your shrewdness you could not have guessed  him.  You would have said that he played Hamlet--or the tuba--or  pinochle--you would never have laid your hand on your heart and said:  &quot;He is a hermit who lived ten years in a cave for love of one lady--to  win another.&quot;</p>
<p>The dancing pavilion extended above the waters of the river.  Gay  lanterns and frosted electric globes shed a soft glamour within it.  A  hundred ladies and gentlemen from the inn and summer cottages flitted  in and about it.  To the left of the dusty roadway down which the  hermit had tramped were the inn and grill-room.  Something seemed to  be on there, too.  The windows were brilliantly lighted, and music was  playing--music different from the two-steps and waltzes of the casino  band.</p>
<p>A negro man wearing a white jacket came through the iron gate, with  its immense granite posts and wrought-iron lamp-holders.</p>
<p>&quot;What is going on here to-night?&quot; asked the hermit.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sah,&quot; said the servitor, &quot;dey is having de reg&#x27;lar Thursday- evenin&#x27; dance in de casino.  And in de grill-room dere&#x27;s a beefsteak  dinner, sah.&quot;</p>
<p>The hermit glanced up at the inn on the hillside whence burst suddenly  a triumphant strain of splendid harmony.</p>
<p>&quot;And up there,&quot; said he, &quot;they are playing Mendelssohn--what is going  on up there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Up in de inn,&quot; said the dusky one, &quot;dey is a weddin&#x27; goin&#x27; on.  Mr.   Binkley, a mighty rich man, am marryin&#x27; Miss Trenholme, sah--de young  lady who am quite de belle of de place, sah.&quot;</p>
<p>HE ALSO SERVES</p>
<p>If I could have a thousand years--just one little thousand years--more  of life, I might, in that time, draw near enough to true Romance to  touch the hem of her robe.</p>
<p>Up from ships men come, and from waste places and forest and road and  garret and cellar to maunder to me in strangely distributed words of  the things they have seen and considered.  The recording of their  tales is no more than a matter of ears and fingers.  There are only  two fates I dread--deafness and writer&#x27;s cramp.  The hand is yet  steady; let the ear bear the blame if these printed words be not in  the order they were delivered to me by Hunky Magee, true camp-follower  of fortune.</p>
<p>Biography shall claim you but an instant--I first knew Hunky when he  was head-waiter at Chubb&#x27;s little beefsteak restaurant and cafe on  Third Avenue.  There was only one waiter besides.</p>
<p>Then, successively, I caromed against him in the little streets of the  Big City after his trip to Alaska, his voyage as cook with a treasure- seeking expedition to the Caribbean, and his failure as a pearl-fisher  in the Arkansas River.  Between these dashes into the land of  adventure he usually came back to Chubb&#x27;s for a while.  Chubb&#x27;s was a  port for him when gales blew too high; but when you dined there and  Hunky went for your steak you never knew whether he would come to  anchor in the kitchen or in the Malayan Archipelago.  You wouldn&#x27;t  care for his description--he was soft of voice and hard of face, and  rarely had to use more than one eye to quell any approach to a  disturbance among Chubb&#x27;s customers.</p>
<p>One night I found Hunky standing at a corner of Twenty-third Street  and Third Avenue after an absence of several months.  In ten minutes  we had a little round table between us in a quiet corner, and my ears  began to get busy.  I leave out my sly ruses and feints to draw  Hunky&#x27;s word-of-mouth blows--it all came to something like this:</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking of the next election,&quot; said Hunky, &quot;did you ever know much  about Indians? No? I don&#x27;t mean the Cooper, Beadle, cigar-store, or  Laughing Water kind-I mean the modern Indian--the kind that takes  Greek prizes in colleges and scalps the half-back on the other side in  football games.  The kind that eats macaroons and tea in the  afternoons with the daughter of the professor of biology, and fills up  on grasshoppers and fried rattlesnake when they get back to the  ancestral wickiup.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, they ain&#x27;t so bad.  I like &#x27;em better than most foreigners that  have come over in the last few hundred years.  One thing about the  Indian is this: when he mixes with the white race he swaps all his own  vices for them of the pale-faces--and he retains all his own virtues.   Well, his virtues are enough to call out the reserves whenever he lets  &#x27;em loose.  But the imported foreigners adopt our virtues and keep  their own vices--and it&#x27;s going to take our whole standing army some  day to police that gang.</p>
<p>&quot;But let me tell you about the trip I took to Mexico with High jack  Snakefeeder, a Cherokee twice removed, a graduate of a Pennsylvania  college and the latest thing in pointed-toed, rubber-heeled, patent  kid moccasins and Madras hunting-shirt with turned-back cuffs.  He was  a friend of mine.  I met him in Tahlequah when I was out there during  the land boom, and we got thick.  He had got all there was out of  colleges and had come back to lead his people out of Egypt.  He was a  man of first-class style and wrote essays, and had been invited to  visit rich guys&#x27; houses in Boston and such places.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a Cherokee girl in Muscogee that High Jack was foolish  about.  He took me to see her a few times.  Her name was Florence Blue  Feather--but you want to clear your mind of all ideas of squaws with  nose-rings and army blankets.  This young lady was whiter than you  are, and better educated than I ever was.  You couldn&#x27;t have told her  from any of the girls shopping in the swell Third Avenue stores.  I  liked her so well that, I got to calling on her now and then when High  Jack wasn&#x27;t along, which is the way of friends in such matters.  She  was educated at the Muscogee College, and was making a specialty of-- let&#x27;s see--eth--yes, ethnology.  That&#x27;s the art that goes back and  traces the descent of different races of people, leading up from  jelly-fish through monkeys and to the O&#x27;Briens.  High Jack had took up  that line too, and had read papers about it before all kinds of  riotous assemblies--Chautauquas and Choctaws and chowder-parties, and  such.  Having a mutual taste for musty information like that was what  made &#x27;em like each other, I suppose.  But I don&#x27;t know!  What they  call congeniality of tastes ain&#x27;t always it.  Now, when Miss Blue  Feather and me was talking together, I listened to her affidavits  about the first families of the Land of Nod being cousins german  (well, if the Germans don&#x27;t nod, who does?) to the mound-builders of  Ohio with incomprehension and respect.  And when I&#x27;d tell her about  the Bowery and Coney Island, and sing her a few songs that I&#x27;d heard  the Jamaica niggers sing at their church lawn-parties, she didn&#x27;t look  much less interested than she did when High Jack would tell her that  he had a pipe that the first inhabitants of America originally arrived  here on stilts after a freshet at Tenafly, New Jersey.</p>
<p>&quot;But I was going to tell you more about High Jack.</p>
<p>&quot;About six months ago I get a letter from him, saying he&#x27;d been  commissioned by the Minority Report Bureau of Ethnology at Washington  to go down to Mexico and translate some excavations or dig up the  meaning of some shorthand notes on some ruins--or something of that  sort.  And if I&#x27;d go along he could squeeze the price into the expense  account.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;d been holding a napkin over my arm at Chubb&#x27;s about long  enough then, so I wired High Jack &#x27;Yes&#x27;; and he sent me a ticket, and  I met him in Washington, and he had a lot of news to tell me.  First  of all, was that Florence Blue Feather had suddenly disappeared from  her home and environments.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Run away?&#x27; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Vanished,&#x27; says High Jack.  &#x27;Disappeared like your shadow when the  sun goes under a cloud.  She was seen on the street, and then she  turned a corner and nobody ever seen her afterward.  The whole  community turned out to look for her, but we never found a clew.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;That&#x27;s bad--that&#x27;s bad,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;She was a mighty nice girl, and  as smart as you find em.</p>
<p>&quot;High Jack seemed to take it hard.  I guess he must have esteemed Miss  Blue Feather quite highly.  I could see that he&#x27;d referred the matter  to the whiskey-jug.  That was his weak point--and many another man&#x27;s.   I&#x27;ve noticed that when a man loses a girl he generally takes to drink  either just before or just after it happens.</p>
<p>&quot;From Washington we railroaded it to New Orleans, and there took a  tramp steamer bound for Belize.  And a gale pounded us all down the  Caribbean, and nearly wrecked us on the Yucatan coast opposite a  little town without a harbor called Boca de Coacoyula.   Suppose the  ship had run against that name in the dark!</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Better fifty years of Europe than a cyclone in the bay,&#x27; says High  Jack Snakefeeder.  So we get the captain to send us ashore in a dory  when the squall seemed to cease from squalling.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;We will find ruins here or make &#x27;em,&#x27; says High.  &#x27;The Government  doesn&#x27;t care which we do.  An appropriation is an appropriation.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Boca de Coacoyula was a dead town.  Them biblical towns we read  about--Tired and Siphon--after they was destroyed, they must have  looked like Forty-second Street and Broadway compared to this Boca  place.  It still claimed 1300 inhabitants as estimated and engraved on  the stone court-house by the census-taker in 1597.  The citizens were  a mixture of Indians and other Indians; but some of &#x27;em was light- colored, which I was surprised to see.  The town was huddled up on the  shore, with woods so thick around it that a subpoena-server couldn&#x27;t  have reached a monkey ten yards away with the papers.  We wondered  what kept it from being annexed to Kansas; but we soon found out that  it was Major Bing.</p>
<p>&quot;Major Bing was the ointment around the fly.  He had the cochineal,  sarsaparilla, log-wood, annatto, hemp, and all other dye-woods and  pure food adulteration concessions cornered.  He had five-sixths of  the Boca de Thingama jiggers working for him on shares.  It was a  beautiful graft.  We used to brag about Morgan and E.  H.  and others  of our wisest when I was in the provinces--but now no more.  That  peninsula has got our little country turned into a submarine without  even the observation tower showing.</p>
<p>&quot;Major Bing&#x27;s idea was this.  He had the population go forth into the  forest and gather these products.  When they brought &#x27;em in he gave  &#x27;em one-fifth for their trouble.  Sometimes they&#x27;d strike and demand a  sixth.  The Major always gave in to &#x27;em.</p>
<p>&quot;The Major had a bungalow so close on the sea that the nine-inch tide  seeped through the cracks in the kitchen floor.  Me and him and High  Jack Snakefeeder sat on the porch and drank rum from noon till  midnight.  He said he had piled up $300,000 in New Orleans banks, and  High and me could stay with him forever if we would.  But High Jack  happened to think of the United States, and began to talk ethnology.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Ruins!&#x27; says Major Bing.  &#x27;The woods are full of &#x27;em.  I don&#x27;t know  how far they date back, but they was here before I came.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;High Jack asks what form of worship the citizens of that locality are  addicted to.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Why,&#x27; says the Major, rubbing his nose, &#x27;I can&#x27;t hardly say.  I  imagine it&#x27;s infidel or Aztec or Nonconformist or something like that.   There&#x27;s a church here--a Methodist or some other kind--with a parson  named Skidder.  He claims to have converted the people to  Christianity.  He and me don&#x27;t assimilate except on state occasions.   I imagine they worship some kind of gods or idols yet.  But Skidder  says he has &#x27;em in the fold.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;A few days later High Jack and me, prowling around, strikes a plain  path into the forest, and follows it a good four miles.  Then a branch  turns to the left.  We go a mile, maybe, down that, and run up against  the finest ruin you ever saw--solid stone with trees and vines and  under-brush all growing up against it and in it and through it.  All  over it was chiselled carvings of funny beasts and people that would  have been arrested if they&#x27;d ever come out in vaudeville that way.  We  approached it from the rear.</p>
<p>&quot;High Jack had been drinking too much rum ever since we landed in  Boca.  You know how an Indian is--the palefaces fixed his clock when  they introduced him to firewater.  He&#x27;d brought a quart along with  him.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Hunky,&#x27; says he, &#x27;we&#x27;ll explore the ancient temple.  It may be that  the storin that landed us here was propitious.  The Minority Report  Bureau of Ethnology,&#x27; says he, &#x27;may yet profit by the vagaries of wind  and tide.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;We went in the rear door of the bum edifice.  We struck a kind of  alcove without bath.  There was a granite davenport, and a stone wash- stand without any soap or exit for the water, and some hardwood pegs  drove into holes in the wall, and that was all.  To go out of that  furnished apartment into a Harlem hall bedroom would make you feel  like getting back home from an amateur violoncello solo at an East  Side Settlement house.</p>
<p>&quot;While High was examining some hieroglyphics on the wall that the  stone-masons must have made when their tools slipped, I stepped into  the front room.  That was at least thirty by fifty feet, stone floor,  six little windows like square port-holes that didn&#x27;t let much light  in.</p>
<p>&quot;I looked back over my shoulder, and sees High Jack&#x27;s face three feet  away.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;High,&#x27; says I, &#x27;of all the--&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;And then I noticed he looked funny, and I turned around.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;d taken off his clothes to the waist, and he didn&#x27;t seem to hear  me.  I touched him, and came near beating it.  High Jack had turned to  stone.  I had been drinking some rum myself.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Ossified!&#x27; I says to him, loudly.  &#x27;I knew what would happen if you  kept it up.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;And then High Jack comes in from the alcove when he hears me  conversing with nobody, and we have a look at Mr.  Snakefeeder No.  2.   It&#x27;s a stone idol, or god, or revised statute or something, and it  looks as much like High Jack as one green pea looks like itself.  It&#x27;s  got exactly his face and size and color, but it&#x27;s steadier on its  pins.  It stands on a kind of rostrum or pedestal, and you can see  it&#x27;s been there ten million years.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;He&#x27;s a cousin of mine,&#x27; sings High, and then he turns solemn.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Hunky,&#x27; he says, putting one hand on my shoulder and one on the  statue&#x27;s, &#x27;I&#x27;m in the holy temple of my ancestors.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well, if looks goes for anything,&#x27; says I, &#x27;you&#x27;ve struck a twin.   Stand side by side with buddy, and let&#x27;s see if there&#x27;s any  diff&#x27;erence.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;There wasn&#x27;t.  You know an Indian can keep his face as still as an  iron dog&#x27;s when he wants to, so when High Jack froze his features you  couldn&#x27;t have told him from the other one.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;There&#x27;s some letters,&#x27; says I, &#x27;on his nob&#x27;s pedestal, but I can&#x27;t  make &#x27;em out.  The alphabet of this country seems to be composed of  sometimes a, e, I, o, and u, but generally z&#x27;s, l&#x27;s, and t&#x27;s.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;High Jack&#x27;s ethnology gets the upper hand of his rum for a minute,  and he investigates the inscription.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Hunky,&#x27; says he, &#x27;this is a statue of Tlotopaxl, one of the most  powerful gods of the ancient Aztecs.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Glad to know him,&#x27; says I, &#x27;but in his present condition he reminds  me of the joke Shakespeare got off on Julius Caesar.  We might say  about your friend:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Imperious what&#x27;s-his-name, dead and tunied to stone--   No use to write or call him on the &#x27;phone.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Hunky,&#x27; says High Jack Snakefeeder, looking at me funny, &#x27;do you  believe in reincarnation?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It sounds to me,&#x27; says I, &#x27;like either a clean-up of the slaughter- houses or a new kind of Boston pink.  I don&#x27;t know.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I believe,&#x27; says he, &#x27;that I am the reincarnation of Tlotopaxl.  My  researches have convinced me that the Cherokees, of all the North  American tribes, can boast of the straightest descent from the proud  Aztec race.  That,&#x27; says he, &#x27;was a favorite theory of mine and  Florence Blue Feather&#x27;s.  And she--what&#x27; if she--!&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;High Jack grabs my arm and walls his eyes at me.  Just then he looked  more like his eminent co-Indian murderer, Crazy Horse.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well,&#x27; says I, &#x27;what if she, what if she, what if she? You&#x27;re  drunk,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Impersonating idols and believing in--what was it ?- -recarnalization?  Let&#x27;s have a drink,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;It&#x27;s as spooky here  as a Brooklyn artificial-limb factory at midnight with the gas turned  down.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Just then I heard somebody coming, and I dragged High Jack into the  bedless bedchamber.  There was peep-holes bored through the wall, so  we could see the whole front part of the temple.</p>
<p>Major Bing told me afterward that the ancient priests in charge used  to rubber through them at the congregation.</p>
<p>&quot;In a few minutes an old Indian woman came in with a&#x27; big oval earthen  dish full of grub.  She set it on a square block of stone in front of  the graven image, and laid down and walloped her face on the floor a  few times, and then took a walk for herself.</p>
<p>&quot;High Jack and me was hungry, so we came out and looked it over.   There was goat steaks and fried rice-cakes, and plantains and cassava,  and broiled land-crabs and mangoes--nothing like what you get at  Chubb&#x27;s.</p>
<p>&quot;We ate hearty--and had another round of rum.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It must be old Tecumseh&#x27;s--or whatever you call him--birthday,&#x27; says  I.  &#x27;Or do they feed him every day?  I thought gods only drank vanilla  on Mount Catawampus.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Then some more native parties in short kimonos that showed their  aboriginees punctured the near-horizon, and me and High had to skip  back into Father Axletree&#x27;s private boudoir.  They came by ones, twos,  and threes, and left all sorts of offerings--there was enough grub for  Bingham&#x27;s nine gods of war, with plenty left over for the Peace  Conference at The Hague.  They brought jars of honey, and bunches of  bananas, and bottles of wine, and stacks of tortillas, and beautiful  shawls worth one hundred dollars apiece that the Indian women weave of  a kind of vegetable fibre like silk.  All of &#x27;em got down and wriggled  on the floor in front of that hard-finish god, and then sneaked off  through the woods again.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I wonder who gets this rake-off?&#x27; remarks High Jack.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh,&#x27; says I, &#x27;there&#x27;s priests or deputy idols or a committee of  disarrangements somewhere in the woods on the job.  Wherever you find  a god you&#x27;ll find somebody waiting to take charge of the burnt  offerings.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;And then we took another swig of rum and walked out to the parlor  front door to cool off, for it was as hot inside as a summer camp on  the Palisades.</p>
<p>&quot;And while we stood there in the breeze we looks down the path and  sees a young lady approaching the blasted ruin.  She was bare-footed  and had on a white robe, and carried a wreath of white flowers in her  hand.  When she got nearer we saw she had a long blue feather stuck  through her black hair.  And when she got nearer still me and High  Jack Snakefeeder grabbed each other to keep from tumbling down on the  floor; for the girl&#x27;s face was as much like Florence Blue Feather&#x27;s as  his was like old King Toxicology&#x27;s.</p>
<p>&quot;And then was when High Jack&#x27;s booze drowned his system of ethnology.   He dragged me inside back of the statue, and says:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Lay hold of it, Hunky.  We&#x27;ll pack it into the other room.  I felt  it all the time,&#x27; says he.  &#x27;I&#x27;m the reconsideration of the god  Locomotorataxia, and Florence Blue Feather was my bride a thousand  years ago.  She has come to seek me in the temple where I used to  reign.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;All right,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;There&#x27;s no use arguing against the rum  question.  You take his feet.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;We lifted the three-hundred-pound stone god, and carried him into the  back room of the cafe--the temple, I mean--and leaned him against the  wall.  It was more work than bouncing three live ones from an all- night Broadway joint on New-Year&#x27;s Eve.</p>
<p>&quot;Then High Jack ran out and brought in a couple of them Indian silk  shawls and began to undress himself.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh, figs!&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Is it thus?  Strong drink is an adder and  subtractor, too.  Is it the heat or the call of the wild that&#x27;s got  you ?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;But High Jack is too full of exaltation and cane-juice to reply.  He  stops the disrobing business just short of the Manhattan Beach rules,  and then winds them red-and-white shawls around him, and goes out and.   stands on the pedestal as steady as any platinum deity you ever saw.   And I looks through a peek-hole to see what he is up to.</p>
<p>&quot;In a few minutes in comes the girl with the flower wreath.  Danged if  I wasn&#x27;t knocked a little silly when she got close, she looked so  exactly much like Florence Blue Feather.  &#x27;I wonder,&#x27; says I to  myself, &#x27;if she has been reincarcerated, too?  If I could see,&#x27; says I  to myself, &#x27;whether she has a mole on her left--&#x27; But the next minute  I thought she looked one-eighth of a shade darker than Florence; but  she looked good at that.  And High Jack hadn&#x27;t drunk all the rum that  had been drank.</p>
<p>&quot;The girl went up within ten feet of the bum idol, and got down and  massaged her nose with the floor, like the rest did.  Then she went  nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at High Jack&#x27;s  feet.  Rummy as I was, I thought it was kind of nice of her to think  of offering flowers instead of household and kitchen provisions.  Even  a stone god ought to appreciate a little sentiment like that on top of  the fancy groceries they had piled up in front of him.</p>
<p>&quot;And then High Jack steps down from his pedestal, quiet, and mentions  a few words that sounded just like the hieroglyphics carved on the  walls of the ruin.  The girl gives a little jump backward, and her  eyes fly open as big as doughnuts; but she don&#x27;t beat it.</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn&#x27;t she?  I&#x27;ll tell you why I think why.  It don&#x27;t seem to a  girl so supernatural, unlikely, strange, and startling that a stone  god should come to life for her.  If he was to do it for one of them  snub-nosed brown girls on the other side of the woods, now, it would  be different--but her!  I&#x27;ll bet she said to herself:</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, goodness me! you&#x27;ve been a long time getting on your job.  I&#x27;ve  half a mind not to speak to you.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;But she and High Jack holds hands and walks away out of the temple  together.  By the time I&#x27;d had time to take another drink and enter  upon the scene they was twenty yards away, going up the path in the  woods that the girl had come down.  With the natural scenery already  in place, it was just like a play to watch &#x27;em--she looking up at him,  and him giving her back the best that an Indian can hand, out in the  way of a goo-goo eye.  But there wasn&#x27;t anything in that  recarnification and revulsion to tintype for me.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Hey! Injun!&#x27; I yells out to High Jack.</p>
<p>&#x27;We&#x27;ve got a board-bill due in town, and you&#x27;re leaving me without a  cent.  Brace up and cut out the Neapolitan fisher-maiden, and let&#x27;s go  back home.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;But on the two goes; without looking once back until, as you might  say, the forest swallowed &#x27;em up.  And I never saw or heard of High  Jack Snakefeeder from that day to this.  I don&#x27;t know if the Cherokees  came from the Aspics; but if they did, one of &#x27;em went back.</p>
<p>&quot;All I could do was to hustle back to that Boca place and panhandle  Major Bing.  He detached himself from enough of his winnings to buy me  a ticket home.  And I&#x27;m back again on the job at Chubb&#x27;s, sir, and I&#x27;m  going to hold it steady.  Come round, and you&#x27;ll find the steaks as  good as ever.&quot;</p>
<p>I wondered what Hunky Magee thought about his own story; so I asked  him if he had any theories about reincarnation and transmogrification  and such mysteries as he had touched upon.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing like that,&quot; said Hunky, positively.  &quot;What ailed High Jack  was too much booze and education.  They&#x27;ll do an Indian up every  time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what about Miss Blue Feather?&quot; I persisted.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; said Hunky, with a grin, &quot;that little lady that stole High Jack  certainly did give me a jar when I first took a look at her, but it  was only for a minute.  You remember I told you High Jack said that  Miss Florence Blue Feather disappeared from home about a year ago?   Well, where she landed four days later was in as neat a five-room flat  on East Twenty-third Street as you ever walked sideways through--and  she&#x27;s been Mrs.  Magee ever since.&quot;</p>
<p>THE MOMENT OF VICTORY</p>
<p>Ben Granger is a war veteran aged twenty-nine--which should enable you  to guess the war.  He is also principal merchant and postmaster of  Cadiz, a little town over which the breezes from the Gulf of Mexico  perpetually blow.</p>
<p>Ben helped to hurl the Don from his stronghold in the Greater  Antilles; and then, hiking across half the world, he marched as a  corporal-usher up and down the blazing tropic aisles of the open-air  college in which the Filipino was schooled.  Now, with his bayonet  beaten into a cheese-slicer, he rallies his corporal&#x27;s guard of  cronies in the shade of his well-whittled porch, instead of in the  matted jungles of Mindanao.  Always have his interest and choice been  for deeds rather than for words; but the consideration and digestion  of motives is not beyond him, as this story, which is his, will  attest.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it,&quot; he asked me one moonlit eve, as we sat among his boxes  and barrels, &quot;that generally makes men go through dangers, and fire,  and trouble, and starvation, and battle, and such rucouses?  What does  a man do it for?  Why does he try to outdo his fellow-humans, and be  braver and stronger and more daring and showy than even his best  friends are?  What&#x27;s his game?  What does he expect to get out of it?   He don&#x27;t do it just for the fresh air and exercise.  What would you  say, now, Bill, that an ordinary man expects, generally speaking, for  his efforts along the line of ambition and extraordinary hustling in  the marketplaces, forums, shooting-galleries, lyceums, battle-fields,  links, cinder-paths, and arenas of the civilized and vice versa places  of the world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Ben,&quot; said I, with judicial seriousness, &quot;I think we might  safely limit the number of motives of a man who seeks fame to three-to  ambition, which is a desire for popular applause; to avarice, which  looks to the material side of success; and to love of some woman whom  he either possesses or desires to possess.&quot;</p>
<p>Ben pondered over my words while a mocking-bird on the top of a  mesquite by the porch trilled a dozen bars.</p>
<p>&quot;I reckon,&quot; said he, &quot;that your diagnosis about covers the case  according to the rules laid down in the copy-books and historical  readers.  But what I had in my mind was the case of Willie Robbins, a  person I used to know.  I&#x27;ll tell you about him before I close up the  store, if you don&#x27;t mind listening.</p>
<p>&quot;Willie was one of our social set up in San Augustine.  I was clerking  there then for Brady &amp; Murchison, wholesale dry-goods and ranch  supplies.  Willie and I belonged to the same german club and athletic  association and military company.  He played the triangle in our  serenading and quartet crowd that used to ring the welkin three nights  a week somewhere in town.</p>
<p>&quot;Willie jibed with his name considerable.  He weighed about as much as  a hundred pounds of veal in his summer suitings, and he had a &#x27;where- is-Mary?&#x27; expression on his features so plain that you could almost  see the wool growing on him.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet you couldn&#x27;t fence him away from the girls with barbed wire.   You know that kind of young fellows-a kind of a mixture of fools and  angels-they rush in and fear to tread at the same time; but they never  fail to tread when they get the chance.  He was always on hand when &#x27;a  joyful occasion was had,&#x27; as the morning paper would say, looking as  happy as a king full, and at the same time as uncomfortable as a raw  oyster served with sweet pickles.  He danced like he had hind hobbles  on; and he had a vocabulary of about three hundred and fifty words  that he made stretch over four germans a week, and plagiarized from to  get him through two ice-cream suppers and a Sunday-night call.  He  seemed to me to be a sort of a mixture of Maltese kitten, sensitive  plant, and a member of a stranded Two Orphans company.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll give you an estimate of his physiological and pictorial make-up,  and then I&#x27;ll stick spurs into the sides of my narrative.</p>
<p>&quot;Willie inclined to the Caucasian in his coloring and manner of style.   His hair was opalescent and his conversation fragmentary.  His eyes  were the same blue shade as the china dog&#x27;s on the right-hand corner  of your Aunt Ellen&#x27;s mantelpiece.  He took things as they come, and I  never felt any hostility against him.  I let him live, and so did  others.</p>
<p>&quot;But what does this Willie do but coax his heart out of his boots and  lose it to Myra Allison, the liveliest, brightest, keenest, smartest,  and prettiest girl in San Augustine.  I tell you, she had the blackest  eyes, the shiniest curls, and the most tantalizing-- Oh, no, you&#x27;re  off--I wasn&#x27;t a victim.  I might have been, but I knew better.  I kept  out.  Joe Granberry was It from the start.  He had everybody else beat  a couple of leagues and thence east to a stake and mound.  But,  anyhow, Myra was a nine-pound, full-merino, fall-clip fleece, sacked  and loaded on a four-horse team for San Antone.</p>
<p>&quot;One night there was an ice-cream sociable at Mrs.  Colonel  Spraggins&#x27;, in San Augustine.  We fellows had a big room up-stairs  opened up for us to put our hats and things in, and to comb our hair  and put on the clean collars we brought along inside the sweat-bands  of our hats-in short, a room to fix up in just like they have  everywhere at high-toned doings.  A little farther down the hall was  the girls&#x27; room, which they used to powder up in, and so forth.   Downstairs we--that is, the San Augustine Social Cotillion and  Merrymakers&#x27; Club--had a stretcher put down in the parlor where our  dance was going on.</p>
<p>&quot;Willie Robbins and me happened to be up in our--cloak-room, I believe  we called it when Myra Allison skipped through the hall on her way  down-stairs from the girls&#x27; room.  Willie was standing before the  mirror, deeply interested in smoothing down the blond grass-plot on  his head, which seemed to give him lots of trouble.  Myra was always  full of life and devilment.  She stopped and stuck her head in our  door.  She certainly was good-looking.  But I knew how Joe Granberry  stood with her.  So did Willie; but he kept on ba-a-a-ing after her  and following her around.  He had a system of persistence that didn&#x27;t  coincide with pale hair and light eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Hello, Willie!&#x27; says Myra.  &#x27;What are you doing to yourself in the  glass?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m trying to look fly,&#x27; says Willie.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well, you never could be fly,&#x27; says Myra, with her special laugh,  which was the provokingest sound I ever heard except the rattle of an  empty canteen against my saddle-horn.</p>
<p>&quot;I looked around at Willie after Myra had gone.  He had a kind of a  lily-white look on him which seemed to show that her remark had, as  you might say, disrupted his soul.  I never noticed anything in what  she said that sounded particularly destructive to a man&#x27;s ideas of  self-consciousness; but he was set back to an extent you could  scarcely imagine.</p>
<p>&quot;After we went down-stairs with our clean collars on, Willie never  went near Myra again that night.  After all, he seemed to be a diluted  kind of a skim-milk sort of a chap, and I never wondered that Joe  Granberry beat him out.</p>
<p>&quot;The next day the battleship Maine was blown up, and then pretty soon  somebody-I reckon it was Joe Bailey, or Ben Tillman, or maybe the  Government-declared war against Spain.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, everybody south of Mason &amp; Hamlin&#x27;s line knew that the North by  itself couldn&#x27;t whip a whole country the size of Spain.  So the  Yankees commenced to holler for help, and the Johnny Rebs answered the  call.  &#x27;We&#x27;re coming, Father William, a hundred thousand strong--and  then some,&#x27; was the way they sang it.  And the old party lines drawn  by Sherman&#x27;s march and the Kuklux and nine-cent cotton and the Jim  Crow street-car ordinances faded away.  We became one undivided.   country, with no North, very little East, a good-sized chunk of West,  and a South that loomed up as big as the first foreign label on a new  eight-dollar suit-case.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course the dogs of war weren&#x27;t a complete pack without a yelp from  the San Augustine Rifles, Company D, of the Fourteenth Texas Regiment.   Our company was among the first to land in Cuba and strike terror into  the hearts of the foe.  I&#x27;m not going to give you a history of the  war, I&#x27;m just dragging it in to fill out my story about Willie  Robbins, just as the Republican party dragged it in to help out the</p>
<p>election in 1898.</p>
<p>&quot;If anybody ever had heroitis, it was that Willie Robbins.  From the  minute he set foot on the soil of the tyrants of Castile he seemed to  engulf danger as a cat laps up cream.  He certainly astonished every  man in our company, from the captain up.  You&#x27;d have expected him to  gravitate naturally to the job of an orderly to the colonel, or  typewriter in the commissary--but not any.  He created the part of the  flaxen-haired boy hero who lives and gets back home with the goods,  instead of dying with an important despatch in his hands at his  colonel&#x27;s feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Our company got into a section of Cuban scenery where one of the  messiest and most unsung portions of the campaign occurred.  We were  out every day capering around in the bushes, and having little  skirmishes with the Spanish troops that looked more like kind of  tired-out feuds than anything else.  The war was a joke to us, and of  no interest to them.  We never could see it any other way than as a  howling farce-comedy that the San Augustine Rifles were actually  fighting to uphold the Stars and Stripes.  And the blamed little  senors didn&#x27;t get enough pay to make them care whether they were  patriots or traitors.  Now and then somebody would get killed.  It  seemed like a waste of life to me.  I was at Coney Island when I went  to New York once, and one of them down-hill skidding apparatuses they  call &#x27;roller-coasters&#x27; flew the track and killed a man in a brown  sack-suit.  Whenever the Spaniards shot one of our men, it struck me  as just about as unnecessary and regrettable as that was.</p>
<p>&quot;But I&#x27;m dropping Willie Robbins out of the conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;He was out for bloodshed, laurels, ambition, medals, recommendations,  and all other forms of military glory.  And he didn&#x27;t seem to be  afraid of any of the recognized forms of military danger, such as  Spaniards, cannon-balls, canned beef, gunpowder, or nepotism.  He went  forth with his pallid hair and china-blue eyes and ate up Spaniards  like you would sardines a la canopy.  Wars and rumbles of wars never  flustered him.  He would stand guard-duty, mosquitoes, hardtack,  treat, and fire with equally perfect unanimity.  No blondes in history  ever come in comparison distance of him except the Jack of Diamonds  and Queen Catherine of Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember, one time, a little caballard of Spanish men sauntered out  from behind a patch of sugar-cane and shot Bob Turner, the first  sergeant of our company, while we were eating dinner.  As required by  the army regulations, we fellows went through the usual tactics of  falling into line, saluting the enemy, and loading and firing,  kneeling.</p>
<p>&quot;That wasn&#x27;t the Texas way of scrapping; but, being a very important  addendum and annex to the regular army, the San Augustine Rifles had  to conform to the red-tape system of getting even.</p>
<p>&quot;By the time we had got out our &#x27;Upton&#x27;s Tactics,&#x27; turned to page  fifty-seven, said &#x27;one--two--three--one--two--three&#x27; a couple of  times, and got blank cartridges into our Springfields, the Spanish  outfit had smiled repeatedly, rolled and lit cigarettes by squads, and  walked away contemptuously.</p>
<p>&quot;I went straight to Captain Floyd, and says to him: &#x27;Sam, I don&#x27;t  think this war is a straight game.  You know as well as I do that Bob  Turner was one of the whitest fellows that ever threw a leg over a  saddle, and now these wirepullers in Washington have fixed his clock.   He&#x27;s politically and ostensibly dead.  It ain&#x27;t fair.  Why should they  keep this thing up?  If they want Spain licked, why don&#x27;t they turn  the San Augustine Rifles and Joe Seely&#x27;s ranger company and a car-load  of West Texas deputy-sheriffs onto these Spaniards, and let us  exonerate them from the face of the earth?  I never did,&#x27; says I,  &#x27;care much about fighting by the Lord Chesterfield ring rules.  I&#x27;m  going to hand in my resignation and go home if anybody else I am  personally acquainted with gets hurt in this war.  If you can get  somebody in my place, Sam,&#x27; says I, &#x27;I&#x27;ll quit the first of next week.   I don&#x27;t want to work in an army that don&#x27;t give its help a chance.   Never mind my wages,&#x27; says I; &#x27;let the Secretary of the Treasury keep  &#x27;em.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well, Ben,&#x27; says the captain to me, &#x27;your allegations and  estimations of the tactics of war, government, patriotism, guard- mounting, and democracy are all right.  But I&#x27;ve looked into the  system of international arbitration and the ethics of justifiable  slaughter a little closer, maybe, than you have.  Now, you can hand in  your resignation the first of next week if you are so minded.  But if  you do,&#x27; says Sam, &#x27;I&#x27;ll order a corporal&#x27;s guard to take you over by  that limestone bluff on the creek and shoot enough lead into you to  ballast a submarine air-ship.  I&#x27;m captain of this company, and I&#x27;ve  swore allegiance to the Amalgamated States regardless of sectional,  secessional, and Congressional differences.  Have you got any smoking- tobacco?&#x27; winds up Sam.  &#x27;Mine got wet when I swum the creek this  morning.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;The reason I drag all this non ex parte evidence in is because Willie  Robbins was standing there listening to us.  I was a second sergeant  and he was a private then, but among us Texans and Westerners there  never was as much tactics and subordination as there was in the  regular army.  We never called our captain anything but &#x27;Sam&#x27; except  when there was a lot of major-generals and admirals around, so as to  preserve the discipline.</p>
<p>&quot;And says Willie Robbins to me, in a sharp construction of voice much  unbecoming to his light hair and previous record:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You ought to be shot, Ben, for emitting any such sentiments.  A man  that won&#x27;t fight for his country is worse than a, horse-thief.  If I  was the cap, I&#x27;d put you in the guard-house for thirty days on round  steak and tamales.  War,&#x27; says Willie, &#x27;is great and glorious.  I  didn&#x27;t know you were a coward.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m not,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;If I was, I&#x27;d knock some of the pallidness off  of your marble brow.  I&#x27;m lenient with you,&#x27; I says, &#x27;just as I am  with the Spaniards, because you have always reminded me of something  with mushrooms on the side.  Why, you little Lady of Shalott,&#x27; says I,  &#x27;you underdone leader of cotillions, you glassy fashion and moulded  form, you white-pine soldier made in the Cisalpine Alps in Germany for  the late New-Year trade, do you know of whom you are talking to?   We&#x27;ve been in the same social circle,&#x27; says I, &#x27;and I&#x27;ve put up with  you because you seemed so meek and self-un-satisfying.  I don&#x27;t  understand why you have so sudden taken a personal interest in  chivalrousness and murder.  Your nature&#x27;s undergone a complete  revelation.  Now, how is it?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well, you wouldn&#x27;t understand, Ben,&#x27; says Willie, giving one of his  refined smiles and turning away.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Come back here!&#x27; says I, catching him by the tail of his khaki coat.   &#x27;You&#x27;ve made me kind of mad, in spite of the aloofness in which I have  heretofore held you.  You are out for making a success in this hero  business, and I believe I know what for.  You are doing it either  because you are crazy or because you expect to catch some girl by it.   Now, if it&#x27;s a girl, I&#x27;ve got something here to show you.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have done it, but I was plumb mad.  I pulled a San  Augustine paper out of my hip-pocket, and showed him an item.  It was  a half a column about the marriage of Myra Allison and Joe Granberry.</p>
<p>&quot;Willie laughed, and I saw I hadn&#x27;t touched him.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh,&#x27; says he, &#x27;everybody knew that was going to happen.  I heard  about that a week ago.&#x27;  And then he gave me the laugh again.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;All right,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Then why do you so recklessly chase the bright  rainbow of fame? Do you expect to be elected President, or do you  belong to a suicide club ?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;And then Captain Sam interferes.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You gentlemen quit jawing and go back to your quarters,&#x27; says he,  &#x27;or I&#x27;ll have you escorted to the guard-house.  Now, scat, both of  you!  Before you go, which one of you has got any chewing-tobacco?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;We&#x27;re off, Sam,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;It&#x27;s supper-time, anyhow.  But what do  you think of what we was talking about?  I&#x27;ve noticed you throwing out  a good many grappling-hooks for this here balloon called fame--   What&#x27;s ambition, anyhow?  What does a man risk his life day after day  for?  Do you know of anything he gets in the end that can pay him for  the trouble?  I want to go back home,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I don&#x27;t care whether  Cuba sinks or swims, and I don&#x27;t give a pipeful of rabbit tobacco  whether Queen Sophia Christina or Charlie Culberson rules these fairy  isles; and I don&#x27;t want my name on any list except the list of  survivors.  But I&#x27;ve noticed you, Sam,&#x27; says I, &#x27;seeking the bubble  notoriety in the cannon&#x27;s larynx a number of times.  Now, what do you  do it for?  Is it ambition, business, or some freckle-faced Pheebe at  home that you are heroing for ?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well, Ben,&#x27; says Sam, kind of hefting his sword out from between his  knees, &#x27;as your superior officer I could court-martial you for  attempted cowardice and desertion.  But I won&#x27;t.  And I&#x27;ll tell you  why I&#x27;m trying for promotion and the usual honors of war and conquest.   A major gets more pay than a captain, and I need the money.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Correct for you!&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I can understand that.  Your system of  fame-seeking is rooted in the deepest soil of patriotism.  But I can&#x27;t  comprehend,&#x27; says I, &#x27;why Willie Robbins, whose folks at home are well  off, and who used to be as meek and undesirous of notice as a cat with  cream on his whiskers, should all at once develop into a warrior bold  with the most fire-eating kind of proclivities.  And the girl in his  case seems to have been eliminated by marriage to another fellow.  I  reckon,&#x27; says I, &#x27;it&#x27;s a plain case of just common ambition.  He wants  his name, maybe, to go thundering down the coroners of time.  It must  be that.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, without itemizing his deeds, Willie sure made good as a hero.   He simply spent most of his time on his knees begging our captain to  send him on forlorn hopes and dangerous scouting expeditions.  In  every fight he was the first man to mix it at close quarters with the  Don Alfonsos.  He got three or four bullets planted in various parts  of his autonomy.  Once he went off with a detail of eight men and  captured a whole company of Spanish.  He kept Captain Floyd busy  writing out recommendations of his bravery to send in to head- quarters; and he began to accumulate medals for all kinds of things- heroism and target-shooting and valor and tactics and  uninsubordination, and all the little accomplishments that look good  to the third assistant secretaries of the War Department.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, Cap Floyd got promoted to be a major-general, or a knight  commander of the main herd, or something like that.  He pounded around  on a white horse, all desecrated up with gold-leaf and hen-feathers  and a Good Templar&#x27;s hat, and wasn&#x27;t allowed by the regulations to  speak to us.  And Willie Robbins was made captain of our company.</p>
<p>&quot;And maybe he didn&#x27;t go after the wreath of fame then!  As far as I  could see it was him that ended the war.  He got eighteen of us boys-- friends of his, too--killed in battles that he stirred up himself, and  that didn&#x27;t seem to me necessary at all.  One night he took twelve of  us and waded through a little nil about a hundred and ninety yards  wide, and climbed a couple of mountains, and sneaked through a mile of  neglected shrubbery and a couple of rock-quarries and into a rye-straw  village, and captured a Spanish general named, as they said, Benny  Veedus.  Benny seemed to me hardly worth the trouble, being a blackish  man without shoes or cuffs, and anxious to surrender and throw himself  on the commissary of his foe.</p>
<p>&quot;But that job gave Willie the big boost he wanted.  The San Augustine  News and the Galveston, St.  Louis, New York, and Kansas City papers  printed his picture and columns of stuff about him.  Old San Augustine  simply went crazy over its &#x27;gallant son.&#x27;  The News had an editorial  tearfully begging the Government to call off the regular army and the  national guard, and let Willie carry on the rest of the war single- handed.  It said that a refusal to do so would be regarded as a proof  that the Northern jealousy of the South was still as rampant as ever.</p>
<p>&quot;If the war hadn&#x27;t ended pretty soon, I don&#x27;t know to what heights of  gold braid and encomiums Willie would have climbed; but it did.  There  was a secession of hostilities just three days after he was appointed  a colonel, and got in three more medals by registered mail, and shot  two Spaniards while they were drinking lemonade in an ambuscade.</p>
<p>&quot;Our company went back to San Augustine when the war was over.  There  wasn&#x27;t anywhere else for it to go.  And what do you think?  The old  town notified us in print, by wire cable, special delivery, and a  nigger named Saul sent on a gray mule to San Antone, that they was  going to give us the biggest blow-out, complimentary, alimentary, and  elementary, that ever disturbed the kildees on the sand-flats outside  of the immediate contiguity of the city.</p>
<p>&quot;I say &#x27;we,&#x27; but it was all meant for ex-Private, Captain de facto,  and Colonel-elect Willie Robbins.  The town was crazy about him.  They  notified us that the reception they were going to put up would make  the Mardi Gras in New Orleans look like an afternoon tea in Bury St.   Edmunds with a curate&#x27;s aunt.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the San Augustine Rifles got back home on schedule time.   Everybody was at the depot giving forth Roosevelt-Democrat--they used  to be called Rebel--yells.  There was two brass-bands, and the mayor,  and schoolgirls in white frightening the street-car horses by throwing  Cherokee roses in the streets, and-well, maybe you&#x27;ve seen a  celebration by a town that was inland and out of water.</p>
<p>&quot;They wanted Brevet-Colonel Willie to get into a carriage and be drawn  by prominent citizens and some of the city aldermen to the armory, but  he stuck to his company and marched at the head of it up Sam Houston  Avenue.  The buildings on both sides was covered with flags and  audiences, and everybody hollered &#x27;Robbins!&#x27; or &#x27;Hello, Willie!&#x27; as we  marched up in files of fours.  I never saw a illustriouser-looking  human in my life than Willie was.  He had at least seven or eight  medals and diplomas and decorations on the breast of his khaki coat;  he was sunburnt the color of a saddle, and he certainly done himself  proud.</p>
<p>&quot;They told us at the depot that the courthouse was to be illuminated  at half-past seven, and there would be speeches and chili-con-came at  the Palace Hotel.  Miss Delphine Thompson was to read an original poem  by James Whitcomb Ryan, and Constable Hooker had promised us a salute  of nine guns from Chicago that he had arrested that day.</p>
<p>&quot;After we had disbanded in the armory, Willie says to me:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Want to walk out a piece with me?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Why, yes,&#x27; says I, &#x27;if it ain&#x27;t so far that we can&#x27;t hear the tumult  and the shouting die away.  I&#x27;m hungry myself,&#x27; says I, &#x27;and I&#x27;m  pining for some home grub, but I&#x27;ll go with you.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Willie steered me down some side streets till we came to a little  white cottage in a new lot with a twenty-by-thirty-foot lawn decorated  with brickbats and old barrel-staves.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Halt and give the countersign,&#x27; says I to Willie.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t you know  this dugout?  It&#x27;s the bird&#x27;s-nest that Joe Granberry built before he  married Myra Allison.  What you going there for?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;But Willie already had the gate open.  He walked up the brick walk to  the steps, and I went with him.  Myra was sitting in a rocking-chair  on the porch, sewing.  Her hair was smoothed back kind of hasty and  tied in a knot.  I never noticed till then that she had freckles.  Joe  was at one side of the porch, in his shirtsleeves, with no collar on,  and no signs of a shave, trying to scrape out a hole among the  brickbats and tin cans to plant a little fruit-tree in.  He looked up  but never said a word, and neither did Myra.</p>
<p>&quot;Willie was sure dandy-looking in his uniform, with medals strung on  his breast and his new gold-handled sword.  You&#x27;d never have taken him  for the little white-headed snipe that the girls used to order about  and make fun of.  He just stood there for a minute, looking at Myra  with a peculiar little smile on his face; and then he says to her,  slow, and kind of holding on to his words with his teeth:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh, I don&#x27;t know!  Maybe I could if I tried!&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;That was all that was said.  Willie raised his hat, and we walked  away.</p>
<p>&quot;And, somehow, when he said that, I remembered, all of a sudden, the  night of that dance and Willie brushing his hair before the looking- glass, and Myra sticking her head in the door to guy him.</p>
<p>&quot;When we got back to Sam Houston Avenue, Willie says:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Well, so long, Ben.  I&#x27;m going down home and get off my shoes and  take a rest.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You?&#x27; says I.  &#x27;What&#x27;s the matter with you?  Ain&#x27;t the court-house  jammed with everybody in town waiting to honor the hero?  And two  brass-bands, and recitations and flags and jags and grub to follow  waiting for you?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Willie sighs.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;All right, Ben,&#x27; says he.  &#x27;Darned if I didn&#x27;t forget all about  that.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#x27;s why I say,&quot; concluded Ben Granger, &quot;that you can&#x27;t tell  where ambition begins any more than you can where it is going to wind  up.&quot;</p>
<p>THE HEAD-HUNTER</p>
<p>When the war between Spain and George Dewey was over, I went to the  Philippine Islands.  There I remained as bushwhacker correspondent for  my paper until its managing editor notified me that an eight-hundred- word cablegram describing the grief of a pet carabao over the death of  an infant Moro was not considered by the office to be war news.  So I  resigned, and came home.</p>
<p>On board the trading-vessel that brought me back I pondered much upon  the strange things I had sensed in the weird archipelago of the  yellow-brown people.  The manoeuvres and skirmishings of the petty war  interested me not: I was spellbound by the outlandish and unreadable  countenance of that race that had turned its expressionless gaze upon  us out of an unguessable past.</p>
<p>Particularly during my stay in Mindanao had I been fascinated and  attracted by that delightfully original tribe of heathen known as the  head-hunters.  Those grim, flinty, relentless little men, never seen,  but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle terror of their  concealed presence, paralleling the trail of their prey through  unmapped forests, across perilous mountain-tops, adown bottomless  chasms, into uninhabitable jungles, always near with the invisible  hand of death uplifted, betraying their pursuit only by such signs as  a beast or a bird or a gliding serpent might make-a twig crackling in  the awful, sweat-soaked night, a drench of dew showering from the  screening foliage of a giant tree, a whisper at even from the rushes  of a water-level-a hint of death for every mile and every hour-they  amused me greatly, those little fellows of one idea.</p>
<p>When you think of it, their method is beautifully and almost  hilariously effective and simple.</p>
<p>You have your hut in which you live and carry out the destiny that was  decreed for you.  Spiked to the jamb of your bamboo doorway is a  basket made of green withes, plaited.  From time to time, as vanity or  ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move you, you creep forth  with your snickersnee and take up the silent trail.  Back from it you  come, triumphant, bearing the severed, gory head of your victim, which  you deposit with pardonable pride in the basket at the side of your  door.  It may be the head of your enemy, your friend, or a stranger,  according as competition, jealousy, or simple sportiveness has been  your incentive to labor.</p>
<p>In any case, your reward is certain.  The village men, in passing,  stop to congratulate you, as your neighbor on weaker planes of life  stops to admire and praise the begonias in your front yard.  Your  particular brown maid lingers, with fluttering bosom, casting soft  tiger&#x27;s eyes at the evidence of your love for her.  You chew betel-nut  and listen, content, to the intermittent soft drip from the ends of  the severed neck arteries.  And you show your teeth and grunt like a  water-buffalo--which is as near as you can come to laughing-at the  thought that the cold, acephalous body of your door ornament is being  spotted by wheeling vultures in the Mindanaoan wilds.</p>
<p>Truly, the life of the merry head-hunter captivated me.  He had  reduced art and philosophy to a simple code.  To take your adversary&#x27;s  head, to basket it at the portal of your castle, to see it lying  there, a dead thing, with its cunning and stratagems and power gone--   Is there a better way to foil his plots, to refute his arguments, to  establish your superiority over his skill and wisdom?</p>
<p>The ship that brought me home was captained by an erratic Swede, who  changed his course and deposited me, with genuine compassion, in a  small town on the Pacific coast of one of the Central American  republics, a few hundred miles south of the port to which he had  engaged to convey me.  But I was wearied of movement and exotic  fancies; so I leaped contentedly upon the firm sands of the village of  Mojada, telling myself I should be sure to find there the rest that I  craved.  After all, far better to linger there (I thought), lulled by  the sedative plash of the waves and the rustling of palm-fronds, than  to sit upon the horsehair sofa of my parental home in the East, and  there, cast down by currant wine and cake, and scourged by fatuous  relatives, drivel into the ears of gaping neighbors sad stories of the  death of colonial governors.</p>
<p>When I first saw Chloe Greene she was standing, all in white, in the  doorway of her father&#x27;s tile-roofed &#x27;dobe house.  She was polishing a  silver cup with a cloth, and she looked like a pearl laid against  black velvet.  She turned on me a flatteringly protracted but a  wiltingly disapproving gaze, and then went inside, humming a light  song to indicate the value she placed upon my existence.</p>
<p>Small wonder: for Dr.  Stamford (the most disreputable professional  man between Juneau and Valparaiso) and I were zigzagging along the  turfy street, tunelessly singing the words of Auld Lang Syne to the  air of Muzzer&#x27;s Little Coal-Black Coon.  We had come from the ice  factory, which was Mojada&#x27;s palace of wickedness, where we had been  playing billiards and opening black bottles, white with frost, that we  dragged with strings out of old Sandoval&#x27;s ice-cold vats.</p>
<p>I turned in sudden rage to Dr.  Stamford, as sober as the verger of a  cathedral.  In a moment I had become aware that we were swine cast  before a pearl.</p>
<p>&quot;You beast,&quot; I said, &quot;this is half your doing.  And the other half is  the fault of this cursed country.  I&#x27;d better have gone back to  Sleepy-town and died in a wild orgy of currant wine and buns than to  have had this happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Stamford filled the empty street with his roaring laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;You too!&quot; he cried.  &quot;And all as quick as the popping of a cork.   Well, she does seem to strike agreeably upon the retina.  But don&#x27;t  burn your fingers.  All Mojada will tell you that Louis Devoe is the  man.</p>
<p>&quot;We will see about that,&quot; said I.  &quot;And, perhaps, whether he is a man  as well as the man.&quot;</p>
<p>I lost no time in meeting Louis Devoe.  That was easily accomplished,  for the foreign colony in Mojada numbered scarce a dozen; and they  gathered daily at a half-decent hotel kept by a Turk, where they  managed to patch together the fluttering rags of country and  civilization that were left them.  I sought Devoe before I did my  pearl of the doorway, because I had learned a little of the game of  war, and knew better than to strike for a prize before testing the  strength of the enemy.</p>
<p>A sort of cold dismay-something akin to fear-filled me when I had  estimated him.  I found a man so perfectly poised, so charming, so  deeply learned in the world&#x27;s rituals, so full of tact, courtesy, and  hospitality, so endowed with grace and ease and a kind of careless,  haughty power that I almost overstepped the bounds in probing him, in  turning him on the spit to find the weak point that I so craved for  him to have.  But I left him whole-I had to make bitter acknowledgment  to myself that Louis Devoe was a gentleman worthy of my best blows;  and I swore to give him them.  He was a great merchant of the country,  a wealthy importer and exporter.  All day he sat in a fastidiously  appointed office, surrounded by works of art and evidences of his high  culture, directing through glass doors and windows the affairs of his  house.</p>
<p>In person he was slender and hardly tall.  His small, well-shaped head  was covered with thick, brown hair, trimmed short, and he wore a  thick, brown beard also cut close and to a fine point.  His manners  were a pattern.</p>
<p>Before long I had become a regular and a welcome visitor at the Greene  home.  I shook my wild habits from me like a worn-out cloak.  I  trained for the conflict with the care of a prize-fighter and the  self-denial of a Brahmin.</p>
<p>As for Chloe Greene, I shall weary you with no sonnets to her eyebrow.   She was a splendidly feminine girl, as wholesome as a November pippin,  and no more mysterious than a windowpane.  She had whimsical little  theories that she had deduced from life, and that fitted the maxims of  Epictetus like princess gowns.  I wonder, after all, if that old  duffer wasn&#x27;t rather wise!</p>
<p>Chloe had a father, the Reverend Homer Greene, and an intermittent  mother, who sometimes palely presided over a twilight teapot.  The  Reverend Homer was a burr-like man with a life-work.  He was writing a  concordance to the Scriptures, and had arrived as far as Kings.   Being, presumably, a suitor for his daughter&#x27;s hand, I was timber for  his literary outpourings.  I had the family tree of Israel drilled  into my head until I used to cry aloud in my sleep: &quot;And Aminadab  begat Jay Eye See,&quot; and so forth, until he had tackled another book.   I once made a calculation that the Reverend Homer&#x27;s concordance would  be worked up as far as the Seven Vials mentioned in Revelations about  the third day after they were opened.</p>
<p>Louis Devoe, as well as I, was a visitor and an intimate friend of the  Greenes.  It was there I met him the oftenest, and a more agreeable&#x27;  man or a more accomplished I have never hated in my life.</p>
<p>Luckily or unfortunately, I came to be accepted as a Boy.  My  appearance was youthful, and I suppose I had that pleading and  homeless air that always draws the motherliness that is in women and  the cursed theories and hobbies of pater-familiases.</p>
<p>Chloe called me &quot;Tommy,&quot; and made sisterly fun of my attempts to woo  her.  With Devoe she was vastly more reserved.  He was the man of  romance, one to stir her imagination and deepest feelings had her  fancy leaned toward him.  I was closer to her, but standing in no  glamour; I had the task before me of winning her in what seems to me  the American way of fighting--with cleanness and pluck and everyday  devotion to break away the barriers of friendship that divided us, and  to take her, if I could, between sunrise and dark, abetted by neither  moonlight nor music nor foreign wiles.</p>
<p>Chloe gave no sign of bestowing her blithe affections upon either of  us.  But one day she let out to me an inkling of what she preferred in  a man.  It was tremendously interesting to me, but not illuminating as  to its application.  I had been tormenting her for the dozenth time  with the statement and catalogue of my sentiments toward her.</p>
<p>&quot;Tommy,&quot; said she, &quot;I don&#x27;t want a man to show his love for me by  leading an army against another country and blowing people off the  earth with cannons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you mean that the opposite way,&quot; I answered, &quot;as they say women  do, I&#x27;ll see what I can do.  The papers are full of this diplomatic  row in Russia.  My people know some big people in Washington who are  right next to the army people, and I could get an artillery commission  and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not that way,&quot; interrupted Chloe.  &quot;I mean what I say.  It isn&#x27;t  the big things that are done in the world, Tommy, that count with a  woman.  When the knights were riding abroad in their armor to slay  dragons, many a stay-at-home page won a lonesome lady&#x27;s hand by being  on the spot to pick up her glove and be quick with her cloak when the  wind blew.  The man I am to like best, whoever he shall be, must show  his love in little ways.  He must never forget, after hearing it once,  that I do not like to have any one walk at my left side; that I detest  bright-colored neckties; that I prefer to sit with my back to a light;  that I like candied violets; that I must not be talked to when I am  looking at the moonlight shining on water, and that I very, very often  long for dates stuffed with English walnuts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Frivolity,&quot; I said, with a frown.  &quot;Any well-trained servant would be  equal to such details.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And he must remember,&quot; went on Chloe, to remind me of what I want  when I do not know, myself, what I want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re rising in the scale,&quot; I said.  &quot;What you seem to need is a  first-class clairvoyant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if I say that I am dying to hear a Beethoven sonata, and stamp my  foot when I say it, he must know by that that what my soul craves is  salted almonds; and he will have them ready in his pocket.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said I, &quot;I am at a loss.  I do not know whether your soul&#x27;s  affinity is to be an impresario or a fancy grocer.&quot;</p>
<p>Chole turned her pearly smile upon me.</p>
<p>&quot;Take less than half of what I said as a jest,&quot; she went on.  &quot;And  don&#x27;t think too lightly of the little things, Boy.  Be a paladin if  you must, but don&#x27;t let it show on you.  Most women are only very big  children, and most men are only very little ones.  Please us; don&#x27;t  try to overpower us.  When we want a hero we can make one out of even  a plain grocer the third time he catches our handkerchief before it  falls to the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening I was taken down with pernicious fever.  That is a kind  of coast fever with improvements and high-geared attachments.  Your  temperature goes up among the threes and fours and remains there,  laughing scornfully and feverishly at the cinchona trees and the coal- tar derivatives.  Pernicious fever is a case for a simple  mathematician instead of a doctor.  It is merely this formula:   Vitality + the desire to live--the duration of the fever the result.</p>
<p>I took to my bed in the two-roomed thatched hut where I had been  comfortably established, and sent for a gallon of rum.  That was not  for myself.  Drunk, Stamford was the best doctor between the Andes and  the Pacific.  He came, sat at my bedside, and drank himself into  condition.</p>
<p>&quot;My boy,&quot; said he, &quot;my lily-white and reformed Romeo, medicine will do  you no good.  But I will give you quinine, which, being bitter, will  arouse in you hatred and anger-two stimulants that will add ten per  cent.  to your chances.  You are as strong as a caribou calf, and you  will get well if the fever doesn&#x27;t get in a knockout blow when you&#x27;re  off your guard.&quot;</p>
<p>For two weeks I lay on my back feeling like a Hindoo widow on a  burning ghat.  Old Atasca, an untrained Indian nurse, sat near the  door like a petrified statue of What&#x27;s-the-Use, attending to her  duties, which were, mainly, to see that time went by without slipping  a cog.  Sometimes I would fancy myself back in the Philippines, or, at  worse times, sliding off the horsehair sofa in Sleepytown.</p>
<p>One afternoon I ordered Atasca to vamose, and got up and dressed  carefully.  I took my temperature, which I was pleased to find 104.  I  paid almost dainty attention to my dress, choosing solicitously a  necktie of a dull and subdued hue.  The mirror showed that I was  looking little the worse from my illness.  The fever gave brightness  to my eyes and color to my face.  And while I looked at my reflection  my color went and came again as I thought of Chloe Greene and the  millions of eons that had passed since I&#x27;d seen her, and of Louis  Devoe and the time he had gained on me.</p>
<p>I went straight to her house.  I seemed to float rather than walk; I  hardly felt the ground under my feet; I thought pernicious fever must  be a great boon to make one feel so strong.</p>
<p>I found Chloe and Louis Devoe sitting under the awning in front of the  house.  She jumped up and met me with a double handshake.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m glad, glad, glad to see you out again!&quot; she cried, every word a  pearl strung on the string of her sentence.  &quot;You are well, Tommy--or  better, of course.  I wanted to come to see you, but they wouldn&#x27;t let  me.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said I, carelessly, &quot;it was nothing.  Merely a little fever.   I am out again, as you see.&quot;</p>
<p>We three sat there and talked for half an hour or so.  Then Chloe  looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean.  I could  see in her sea-blue eyes some deep and intense desire.  Devoe, curse  him! saw it too.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; we asked, in unison.</p>
<p>&quot;Cocoanut-pudding,&quot; said Chloe, pathetically.  &quot;I&#x27;ve wanted some--oh,  so badly, for two days.  It&#x27;s got beyond a wish; it&#x27;s an obsession.</p>
<p>&quot;The cocoanut season is over,&quot; said Devoe, in that voice of his that  gave thrilling interest to his most commonplace words.  &quot;I hardly  think one could be found in Mojada.  The natives never use them except  when they are green and the milk is fresh.  They sell all the ripe  ones to the fruiterers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t a broiled lobster or a Welsh rabbit do as well?&quot; I remarked,  with the engaging idiocy of a pernicious-fever convalescent.</p>
<p>Chloe came as near to pouting as a sweet disposition and a perfect  profile would allow her to come.</p>
<p>The Reverend Homer poked his ermine-lined face through the doorway and  added a concordance to the conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; said he, &quot;old Campos keeps the dried nuts in his little  store on the hill.  But it would be far better, my daughter, to  restrain unusual desires, and partake thankfully of the daily dishes  that the Lord has set before us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stuff!&quot; said I.</p>
<p>&quot;How was that?&quot; asked the Reverend Homer, sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;I say it&#x27;s tough,&quot; said I, &quot;to drop into the vernacular, that Miss  Greene should be deprived of the food she desires-a simple thing like  kalsomine-pudding.  Perhaps,&quot; I continued, solicitously, &quot;some pickled  walnuts or a fricassee of Hungarian butternuts would do as well.&quot;</p>
<p>Every one looked at me with a slight exhibition of curiosity.</p>
<p>Louis Devoe arose and made his adieus.  I watched him until he had  sauntered slowly and grandiosely to the corner, around which he turned  to reach his great warehouse and store.  Chloe made her excuses, and  went inside for a few minutes to attend to some detail affecting the  seven-o&#x27;clock dinner.  She was a passed mistress in housekeeping.  I  had tasted her puddings and bread with beatitude.</p>
<p>When all had gone, I turned casually and saw a basket made of plaited  green withes hanging by a nail outside the door-jamb.  With a rush  that made my hot temples throb there came vividly to my mind  recollections of the head-hunters--those grim, flinty, relentless  little men, never seen, but chilling the warmest noonday by the subtle  terror of their concealed presence.  .  .  .  From time to time, as  vanity or ennui or love or jealousy or ambition may move him, one  creeps forth with his snickersnee and takes up the silent trail.  .  .   .  Back he comes, triumphant, bearing the severed, gory head of his  victim .  .  .  His particular brown or white maid lingers, with  fluttering bosom, casting soft tiger&#x27;s eyes at the evidence of his  love for her.</p>
<p>I stole softly from the house and returned to my hut.  From its  supporting nails in the wall I took a machete as heavy as a butcher&#x27;s  cleaver and sharper than a safety-razor.  And then I chuckled softly  to myself, and set out to the fastidiously appointed private office of  Monsieur Louis Devoe, usurper to the hand of the Pearl of the Pacific.</p>
<p>He was never slow at thinking; he gave one look at my face and another  at the weapon in my hand as I entered his door, and then he seemed to  fade from my sight.  I ran to the back door, kicked it open, and saw  him running like a deer up the road toward the wood that began two  hundred yards away.  I was after him, with a shout.  I remember  hearing children and women screaming, and seeing them flying from the  road.</p>
<p>He was fleet, but I was stronger.  A mile, and I had almost come up  with him.  He doubled cunningly and dashed into a brake that extended  into a small canon.  I crashed through this after him, and in five  minutes had him cornered in an angle of insurmountable cliffs.  There  his instinct of self-preservation steadied him, as it will steady even  animals at bay.  He turned to me, quite calm, with a ghastly smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Rayburn!&quot; he said, with such an awful effort at ease that I was  impolite enough to laugh rudely in his face.  &quot;Oh, Rayburn!&quot; said he,  &quot;come, let&#x27;s have done with this nonsense.  Of course, I know it&#x27;s the  fever and you&#x27;re not yourself; but collect yourself, man-give me that  ridiculous weapon, now, and let&#x27;s go back and talk it over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will go back,&quot; said I, &quot;carrying your head with me.  We will see  how charmingly it can discourse when it lies in the basket at her  door.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come,&quot; said he, persuasively, &quot;I think better of you than to suppose  that you try this sort of thing as a joke.  But even the vagaries of a  fever-crazed lunatic come some time to a limit.  What is this talk  about heads and baskets?  Get yourself together and throw away that  absurd cane-chopper.  What would Miss Greene think of you?&quot; he ended,  with the silky cajolery that one would use toward a fretful child.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen,&quot; said I.  &quot;At last you have struck upon the right note.  What  would she think of me? Listen,&quot; I repeated.</p>
<p>&quot;There are women,&quot; I said, &quot;who look upon horsehair sofas and currant  wine as dross.  To them even the calculated modulation of your well- trimmed talk sounds like the dropping of rotten plums from a tree in  the night.  They are the maidens who walk back and forth in the  villages, scorning the emptiness of the baskets at the doors of the  young men who would win them.</p>
<p>One such as they,&quot; I said, &quot;is waiting.  Only a fool would try to win  a woman by drooling like a braggart in her doorway or by waiting upon  her whims like a footman.  They are all daughters of Herodias, and to  gain their hearts one must lay the heads of his enemies before them  with his own hands.  Now, bend your neck, Louis Devoe.  Do not be a  coward as well as a chatterer at a lady&#x27;s tea-table.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There, there!&quot; said Devoe, falteringly.  &quot;You know me, don&#x27;t you,  Rayburn?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; I said, &quot;I know you.  I know you.  I know you.  But the  basket is empty.  The old men of the village and the young men, and  both the dark maidens and the ones who are as fair as pearls walk back  and forth and see its emptiness.  Will you kneel now, or must we have  a scuffle?  It is not like you to make things go roughly and with bad  form.  But the basket is waiting for your head.&quot;</p>
<p>With that he went to pieces.  I had to catch him as he tried to  scamper past me like a scared rabbit.  I stretched him out and got a  foot on his chest, but he squirmed like a worm, although I appealed  repeatedly to his sense of propriety and the duty he owed to himself  as a gentleman not to make a row.</p>
<p>But at last he gave me the chance, and I swung the machete.</p>
<p>It was not hard work.  He flopped like a chicken during the six or  seven blows that it took to sever his head; but finally he lay still,  and I tied his head in my handkerchief.  The eyes opened and shut  thrice while I walked a hundred yards.  I was red to my feet with the  drip, but what did that matter?  With delight I felt under my hands  the crisp touch of his short, thick, brown hair and close-trimmed  beard.</p>
<p>I reached the house of the Greenes and dumped the head of Louis Devoe  into the basket that still hung by the nail in the door-jamb.  I sat  in a chair under the awning and waited.  The sun was within two hours  of setting.  Chloe came out and looked surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;Where have you been, Tommy?&quot; she asked.  &quot;You were gone when I came  out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look in the basket,&quot; I said, rising to my feet.  She looked, and gave  a little scream--of delight, I was pleased to note.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Tommy!&quot; she said.  &quot;It was just what I wanted you to do.  It&#x27;s  leaking a little, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.  Wasn&#x27;t I telling you?   It&#x27;s the little things that count.  And you remembered.&quot;</p>
<p>Little things!  She held the ensanguined head of Louis Devoe in her  white apron.  Tiny streams of red widened on her apron and dripped  upon the floor.  Her face was bright and tender.</p>
<p>&quot;Little things, indeed!&quot; I thought again.  &quot;The head-hunters are  right.  These are the things that women like you to do for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloe came close to me.  There was no one in sight.  She looked tip at  me with sea-blue eyes that said things they had never said before.</p>
<p>&quot;You think of me,&quot; she said.  &quot;You are the man I was describing.  You  think of the little things, and they are what make the world worth  living in.  The man for me must consider my little wishes, and make me  happy in small ways.  He must bring me little red peaches in December  if I wish for them, and then I will love him till June.  I will have  no knight in armor slaying his rival or killing dragons for me.  You  please me very well, Tommy.&quot;</p>
<p>I stooped and kissed her.  Then a moisture broke out on my forehead,  and I began to feel weak.  I saw the red stains vanish from Chloe&#x27;s  apron, and the head of Louis Devoe turn to a brown, dried cocoanut.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be cocoanut-pudding for dinner, Tommy, boy,&quot; said Chloe,  gayly, &quot;and you must come.  I must go in for a little while.&quot;</p>
<p>She vanished in a delightful flutter.</p>
<p>Dr.  Stamford tramped up hurriedly.  He seized my pulse as though it  were his own property that I had escaped with.</p>
<p>&quot;You are the biggest fool outside of any asylum!&quot; he said, angrily.   &quot;Why did you leave your bed?  And the idiotic things you&#x27;ve been  doing!--and no wonder, with your pulse going like a sledge-hammer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Name some of them,&quot; said I.</p>
<p>&quot;Devoe sent for me,&quot; said Stamford.  &quot;He saw you from his window go to  old Campos&#x27; store, chase him up the hill with his own yardstick, and  then come back and make off with his biggest cocoanut.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the little things that count, after all,&quot; said I.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s your little bed that counts with you just now,&quot; said the doctor.   &quot;You come with me at once, or I&#x27;ll throw up the case.  &#x27;You&#x27;re as  loony as a loon.&quot;</p>
<p>So I got no cocoanut-pudding that evening, but I conceived a distrust  as to the value of the method of the head-hunters.  Perhaps for many  centuries the maidens of the villages may have been looking wistfully  at the heads in the baskets at the doorways, longing for other and  lesser trophies.</p>
<p>NO STORY</p>
<p>To avoid having this book hurled into corner of the room by the  suspicious reader, I will assert in time that this is not a newspaper  story.  You will encounter no shirt-sleeved, omniscient city editor,  no prodigy &quot;cub&quot; reporter just off the farm, no scoop, no story--no  anything.</p>
<p>But if you will concede me the setting of the first scene in the  reporters&#x27; room of the Morning Beacon, I will repay the favor by  keeping strictly my promises set forth above.</p>
<p>I was doing space-work on the Beacon, hoping to be put on a salary.   Some one had cleared with a rake or a shovel a small space for me at  the end of a long table piled high with exchanges, Congressional  Records, and old files.  There I did my work.  I wrote whatever the  city whispered or roared or chuckled to me on my diligent wanderings  about its streets.  My income was not regular.</p>
<p>One day Tripp came in and leaned on my table.  Tripp was something in  the mechanical department--I think he had something to do with the  pictures, for he smelled of photographers&#x27; supplies, and his hands  were always stained and cut up with acids.  He was about twenty-five  and looked forty.  Half of his face was covered with short, curly red</p>
<p>whiskers that looked like a door-mat with the &quot;welcome&quot; left off.  He  was pale and unhealthy and miserable and fawning, and an assiduous  borrower of sums ranging from twenty-five cents to a dollar.  One  dollar was his limit.  He knew the extent of his credit as well as the  Chemical National Bank knows the amount of H20 that collateral will  show on analysis.  When he sat on my table he held one hand with the  other to keep both from shaking.  Whiskey.  He had a spurious air of  lightness and bravado about him that deceived no one, but was useful  in his borrowing because it was so pitifully and perceptibly assumed.</p>
<p>This day I had coaxed from the cashier five shining silver dollars as  a grumbling advance on a story that the Sunday editor had reluctantly  accepted.  So if I was not feeling at peace with the world, at least  an armistice had been declared; and I was beginning with ardor to  write a description of the Brooklyn Bridge by moonlight.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Tripp,&quot; said I, looking up at him rather impatiently, &quot;how goes  it?&quot;  He was looking to-day more miserable, more cringing and haggard  and downtrodden than I had ever seen him.  He was at that stage of  misery where he drew your pity so fully that you longed to kick him.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you got a dollar?&quot; asked Tripp, with his most fawning look and  his dog-like eyes that blinked in the narrow space between his high- growing matted beard and his low-growing matted hair.</p>
<p>&quot;I have,&quot; said I; and again I said, &quot;I have,&quot; more loudly and  inhospitably, &quot;and four besides.  And I had hard work corkscrewing  them out of old Atkinson, I can tell you.  And I drew them,&quot; I  continued, &quot;to meet a want--a hiatus--a demand--a need--an exigency--a  requirement of exactly five dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>I was driven to emphasis by the premonition that I was to lose one of  the dollars on the spot.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t want to borrow any,&quot; said Tripp, and I breathed again.  &quot;I  thought you&#x27;d like to get put onto a good story,&quot; he went on.  &quot;I&#x27;ve  got a rattling fine one for you.  You ought to make it run a column at  least.  It&#x27;ll make a dandy if you work it up right.  It&#x27;ll probably  cost you a dollar or two to get the stuff.  I don&#x27;t want anything out  of it myself.&quot;</p>
<p>I became placated.  The proposition showed that Tripp appreciated past  favors, although he did not return them.  If he had been wise enough  to strike me for a quarter then he would have got it.</p>
<p>&quot;What is the story ?&quot; I asked, poising my pencil with a finely  calculated editorial air.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you,&quot; said Tripp.  &quot;It&#x27;s a girl.  A beauty.  One of the  howlingest Amsden&#x27;s Junes you ever saw.  Rosebuds covered with dew- violets in their mossy bed--and truck like that.  She&#x27;s lived on Long  Island twenty years and never saw New York City before.  I ran against  her on Thirty-fourth Street.  She&#x27;d just got in on the East River  ferry.  I tell you, she&#x27;s a beauty that would take the hydrogen out of  all the peroxides in the world.  She stopped me on the street and  asked me where she could find George Brown.  Asked me where she could  find George Brown in New York City!  What do you think of that?</p>
<p>&quot;I talked to her, and found that she was going to marry a young farmer  named Dodd--Hiram Dodd--next week.  But it seems that George Brown  still holds the championship in her youthful fancy.  George had  greased his cowhide boots some years ago, and came to the city to make  his fortune.  But he forgot to remember to show up again at Greenburg,  and Hiram got in as second-best choice.  But when it comes to the  scratch Ada--her name&#x27;s Ada Lowery--saddles a nag and rides eight  miles to the railroad station and catches the 6.45 A.M.  train for the  city.  Looking for George, you know--you understand about women-- George wasn&#x27;t there, so she wanted him.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you know, I couldn&#x27;t leave her loose in Wolftown-on-the-Hudson.   I suppose she thought the first person she inquired of would say:  &#x27;George Brown ?--why, yes--lemme see--he&#x27;s a short man with light-blue  eyes, ain&#x27;t he?  Oh yes--you&#x27;ll find George on One Hundred and Twenty- fifth Street, right next to the grocery.  He&#x27;s bill-clerk in a saddle- and-harness store.&#x27;  That&#x27;s about how innocent and beautiful she is.   You know those little Long Island water-front villages like Greenburg- -a couple of duck-farms for sport, and clams and about nine summer  visitors for industries.  That&#x27;s the kind of a place she comes from.   But, say--you ought to see her!</p>
<p>&quot;What could I do? I don&#x27;t know what money looks like in the morning.   And she&#x27;d paid her last cent of pocket-money for her railroad ticket  except a quarter, which she had squandered on gum-drops.  She was  eating them out of a paper bag.  I took her to a boarding-house on  Thirty-second Street where I used to live, and hocked her.  She&#x27;s in  soak for a dollar.  That&#x27;s old Mother McGinnis&#x27; price per day.  I&#x27;ll  show you the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What words are these, Tripp?&quot; said I.  &quot;I thought you said you had a  story.  Every ferryboat that crosses the East River brings or takes  away girls from Long Island.&quot;</p>
<p>The premature lines on Tripp&#x27;s face grew deeper.  He frowned seriously  from his tangle of hair.  He separated his hands and emphasized his  answer with one shaking forefinger.</p>
<p>&quot;Can&#x27;t you see,&quot; he said, &quot;what a rattling fine story it would make?   You could do it fine.  All about the romance, you know, and describe  the girl, and put a lot of stuff in it about true love, and sling in a  few stickfuls of funny business--joshing the Long Islanders about  being green, and, well--you know how to do it.  You ought to get  fifteen dollars out of it, anyhow.  And it&#x27;ll.  cost you only about  four dollars.  You&#x27;ll make a clear profit of eleven.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How will it cost me four dollars?&quot; I asked, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&quot;One dollar to Mrs.  McGinnis,&quot; Tripp answered, promptly, &quot;and two  dollars to pay the girl&#x27;s fare back home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the fourth dimension?&quot; I inquired, making a rapid mental  calculation.</p>
<p>&quot;One dollar to me,&quot; said Tripp.  &quot;For whiskey.  Are you on?&quot;</p>
<p>I smiled enigmatically and spread my elbows as if to begin writing  again.  But this grim, abject, specious, subservient, burr-like wreck  of a man would not be shaken off.  His forehead suddenly became  shiningly moist.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you see,&quot; he said, with a sort of desperate calmness, &quot;that  this girl has got to be sent home to-day--not to-night nor to-morrow,  but to-day?  I can&#x27;t do anything for her.  You know, I&#x27;m the janitor  and corresponding secretary of the Down-and-Out Club..  I thought you  could make a newspaper story out of it and win out a piece of money on  general results.  But, anyhow, don&#x27;t you see that she&#x27;s got to get  back home before night?&quot;</p>
<p>And then I began to feel that dull, leaden, soul-depressing sensation  known as the sense of duty.  Why should that sense fall upon one as a  weight and a burden?  I knew that I was doomed that day to give up the  bulk of my store of hard-wrung coin to the relief of this Ada Lowery.   But I swore to myself that Tripp&#x27;s whiskey dollar would not be  forthcoming.  He might play knight-errant at my expense, but he would  indulge in no wassail afterward, commemorating my weakness and  gullibility.  In a kind of chilly anger I put on my coat and hat.</p>
<p>Tripp, submissive, cringing, vainly endeavoring to please, conducted  me via the street-cars to the human pawn-shop of Mother McGinnis.  I  paid the fares.  It seemed that the collodion-scented Don Quixote and  the smallest minted coin were strangers.</p>
<p>Tripp pulled the bell at the door of the mouldly red-brick boarding- house.  At its faint tinkle he paled, and crouched as a rabbit makes  ready to spring away at the sound of a hunting-dog.  I guessed what a  life he had led, terror-haunted by the coming footsteps of landladies.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me one of the dollars--quick!&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The door opened six inches.  Mother McGinnis stood there with white  eyes--they were white, I say--and a yellow face, holding together at  her throat with one hand a dingy pink flannel dressing-sack.  Tripp  thrust the dollar through the space without a word, and it bought us  entry.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s in the parlor,&quot; said the McGinnis, turning the back of her sack  upon us.</p>
<p>In the dim parlor a girl sat at the cracked marble centre-table  weeping comfortably and eating gum-drops.  She was a flawless beauty.   Crying had only made her brilliant eyes brighter.  When she crunched a  gum-drop you thought only of the poetry of motion and envied the  senseless confection.  Eve at the age of five minutes must have been a  ringer for Miss Ada Lowery at nineteen or twenty.  I was introduced,  and a gum-drop suffered neglect while she conveyed to me a naive  interest, such as a puppy dog (a prize winner) might bestow upon a  crawling beetle or a frog.</p>
<p>Tripp took his stand by the table, with the fingers of one hand spread  upon it, as an attorney or a master of ceremonies might have stood.   But he looked the master of nothing.  His faded coat was buttoned  high, as if it sought to be charitable to deficiencies of tie and  linen.</p>
<p>I thought of a Scotch terrier at the sight of his shifty eyes in the  glade between his tangled hair and beard.  For one ignoble moment I  felt ashamed of having been introduced as his friend in the presence  of so much beauty in distress.  But evidently Tripp meant to conduct  the ceremonies, whatever they might be.  I thought I detected in his  actions and pose an intention of foisting the situation upon me as  material for a newspaper story, in a lingering hope of extracting from  me his whiskey dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;My friend&quot; (I shuddered), &quot;Mr.  Chalmers,&quot; said Tripp, &quot;will tell  you, Miss Lowery, the same that I did.  He&#x27;s a reporter, and he can  hand out the talk better than I can.  That&#x27;s why I brought him with  me.&quot;  (0 Tripp, wasn&#x27;t it the silver-tongued orator you wanted?)   &quot;He&#x27;s wise to a lot of things, and he&#x27;ll tell you now what&#x27;s best to  do.&quot;</p>
<p>I stood on one foot, as it were, as I sat in my rickety chair.</p>
<p>&quot;Why--er--Miss Lowery,&quot; I began, secretly enraged at Tripp&#x27;s awkward  opening, &quot;I am at your service, of course, but--er--as I haven&#x27;t been  apprized of the circumstances of the case, I--er--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Miss Lowery, beaming for a moment, &quot;it ain&#x27;t as bad as  that--there ain&#x27;t any circumstances.  It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever  been in New York except once when I was five years old, and I had no  idea it was such a big town.  And I met Mr.--Mr.  Snip on the street  and asked him about a friend of mine, and he brought me here and asked  me to wait.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I advise you, Miss Lowery,&quot; said Tripp, &quot;to tell Mr.  Chalmers all.   He&#x27;s a friend of mine&quot; (I was getting used to it by this time), &quot;and  he&#x27;ll give you the right tip.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, certainly,&quot; said Miss Ada, chewing a gum-drop toward me.  &quot;There  ain&#x27;t anything to tell except that--well, everything&#x27;s fixed for me to  marry Hiram Dodd next Thursday evening.  Hi has got two hundred acres  of land with a lot of shore-front, and one of the best truck-farms on  the Island.  But this morning I had my horse saddled up--he&#x27;s a white  horse named Dancer--and I rode over to the station.  I told &#x27;em at  home I was going to spend the day with Susie Adams.  It was a story, I  guess, but I don&#x27;t care.  And I came to New York on the train, and I  met Mr.--Mr.  Flip on the street and asked him if he knew where I  could find G--G--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Miss Lowery,&quot; broke in Tripp, loudly, and with much bad taste, I  thought, as she hesitated with her word, &quot;you like this young man,  Hiram Dodd, don&#x27;t you?  He&#x27;s all right, and good to you, ain&#x27;t he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I like him,&quot; said Miss Lowery emphatically.  &quot;Hi&#x27;s all  right.  And of course he&#x27;s good to me.  So is everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>I could have sworn it myself.  Throughout Miss Ada Lowery&#x27;s life all  men would be to good to her.  They would strive, contrive, struggle,  and compete to hold umbrellas over her hat, check her trunk, pick up  her handkerchief, buy for her soda at the fountain.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; went on Miss Lowery, &quot;last night got to thinking about G-- George, and I--&quot;</p>
<p>Down went the bright gold head upon dimpled, clasped hands on the  table.  Such a beautiful April storm!  Unrestrainedly sobbed.  I  wished I could have comforted her.  But I was not George.  And I was  glad I was not Hiram--and yet I was sorry, too.</p>
<p>By-and-by the shower passed.  She straightened up, brave and half-way  smiling.  She would have made a splendid wife, for crying only made  her eyes more bright and tender.  She took a gum-drop and began her  story.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I&#x27;m a terrible hayseed,&quot; she said between her little gulps  and sighs, &quot;but I can&#x27;t help it.  G--George Brown and I were sweet- hearts since he was eight and I was five.  When he was nineteen--that  was four years ago--he left Greenburg and went to the city.  He said  he was going to be a policeman or a railroad president or something.   And then he was coming back for me.  But I never heard from him any  more.  And I--I--liked him.&quot;</p>
<p>Another flow of tears seemed imminent, but Tripp hurled himself into  the crevasse and dammed it.  Confound him, I could see his game.  He  was trying to make a story of it for his sordid ends and profit.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on, Mr.  Chalmers,&quot; said he, &quot;and tell the lady what&#x27;s the proper  caper.  That&#x27;s what I told her--you&#x27;d hand it to her straight.  Spiel  up.&quot;</p>
<p>I coughed, and tried to feel less wrathful toward Tripp.  I saw my  duty.  Cunningly I had been inveigled, but I was securely trapped.   Tripp&#x27;s first dictum to me had been just and correct.  The young lady  must be sent back to Greenburg that day.  She must be argued with,  convinced, assured, instructed, ticketed, and returned without delay.   I hated Hiram and despised George; but duty must be done.</p>
<p>Noblesse oblige and only five silver dollars are not strictly romantic  compatibles, but sometimes they can be made to jibe.  It was mine to  be Sir Oracle, and then pay the freight.  So I assumed an air that  mingled Solomon&#x27;s with that of the general passenger agent of the Long  Island Railroad.</p>
<p>&quot;Miss Lowery,&quot; said I, as impressively as I could, &quot;life is rather a  queer proposition, after all.&quot;  There was a familiar sound to these  words after I had spoken them, and I hoped Miss Lowery had never heard  Mr.  Cohan&#x27;s song.  &quot;Those whom we first love we seldom wed.  Our  earlier romances, tinged with the magic radiance of youth, often fail  to materialize.&quot;  The last three words sounded somewhat trite when  they struck the air.  &quot;But those fondly cherished dreams,&quot; I went on,  &quot;may cast a pleasant afterglow on our future lives, however  impracticable and vague they may have been.  But life is full of  realities as well as visions and dreams.  One cannot live on memories.   May I ask, Miss Lowery, if you think you could pass a happy--that is,  a contented and harmonious life with Mr.-er--Dodd--if in other ways  than romantic recollections he seems to--er--fill the bill, as I might  say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Hi&#x27;s all right,&quot; answered Miss Lowery.  &quot;Yes, I could get along  with him fine.  He&#x27;s promised me an automobile and a motor-boat.  But  somehow, when it got so close to the time I was to marry him, I  couldn&#x27;t help wishing--well, just thinking about George.  Something  must have happened to him or he&#x27;d have written.  On the day he left,  he and me got a hammer and a chisel and cut a dime into two pieces.  I  took one piece and he took the other, and we promised to be true to  each other and always keep the pieces till we saw each other again.   I&#x27;ve got mine at home now in a ring-box in the top drawer of my  dresser.  I guess I was silly to come up here looking for him.  I  never realized what a big place it is.&quot;</p>
<p>And then Tripp joined in with a little grating laugh that he had,  still trying to drag in a little story or drama to earn the miserable  dollar that he craved.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, the boys from the country forget a lot when they come to the city  and learn something.  I guess George, maybe, is on the bum, or got  roped in by some other girl, or maybe gone to the dogs on account of  whiskey or the races.  You listen to Mr.  Chalmers and go back home,  and you&#x27;ll be all right.&quot;</p>
<p>But now the time was come for action, for the hands of the clock were  moving close to noon.  Frowning upon Tripp, I argued gently and  philosophically with Miss Lowery, delicately convincing her of the  importance of returning home at once.  And I impressed upon her the  truth that it would not be absolutely necessary to her future  happiness that she mention to Hi the wonders or the fact of her visit  to the city that had swallowed up the unlucky George.</p>
<p>She said she had left her horse (unfortunate Rosinante) tied to a tree  near the railroad station.  Tripp and I gave her instructions to mount  the patient steed as soon as she arrived and ride home as fast as  possible.  There she was to recount the exciting adventure of a day  spent with Susie Adams.  She could &quot;fix&quot; Susie--I was sure of that-- and all would be well.</p>
<p>And then, being susceptible to the barbed arrows of beauty, I warmed  to the adventure.  The three of us hurried to the ferry, and there I  found the price of a ticket to Greenburg to be but a dollar and eighty  cents.  I bought one, and a red, red rose with the twenty cents for  Miss Lowery.  We saw her aboard her ferryboat, and stood watching her  wave her handkerchief at us until it was the tiniest white patch  imaginable.  And then Tripp and I faced each other, brought back to  earth, left dry and desolate in the shade of the sombre verities of  life.</p>
<p>The spell wrought by beauty and romance was dwindling.  I looked at  Tripp and almost sneered.  He looked more careworn, contemptible, and  disreputable than ever.  I fingered the two silver dollars remaining  in my pocket and looked at him with the half-closed eyelids of  contempt.  He mustered up an imitation of resistance.</p>
<p>&quot;Can&#x27;t you get a story out of it?&quot; he asked, huskily.  &quot;Some sort of a  story, even if you have to fake part of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a line,&quot; said I.  &quot;I can fancy the look on Grimes&#x27; face if I  should try to put over any slush like this.  But we&#x27;ve helped the  little lady out, and that&#x27;ll have to be our only reward.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry,&quot; said Tripp, almost inaudibly.  &quot;I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re out your  money.  Now, it seemed to me like a find of a big story, you know-- that is, a sort of thing that would write up pretty well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s try to forget it,&quot; said I, with a praiseworthy attempt at  gayety, &quot;and take the next car &#x27;cross town.&quot;</p>
<p>I steeled myself against his unexpressed but palpable desire.  He  should not coax, cajole, or wring from me the dollar he craved.  I had  had enough of that wild-goose chase.</p>
<p>Tripp feebly unbuttoned his coat of the faded pattern and glossy seams  to reach for something that had once been a handkerchief deep down in  some obscure and cavernous pocket.  As he did so I caught the shine of  a cheap silver-plated watch-chain across his vest, and something  dangling from it caused me to stretch forth my hand and seize it  curiously.  It was the half of a silver dime that had been cut in  halves with a chisel. &quot;What!&quot; I said, looking at him keenly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; he responded, dully.  &quot;George Brown, alias Tripp.  what&#x27;s  the use?&quot;</p>
<p>Barring the W.  C.  T.  U., I&#x27;d like to know if anybody disapproves of  my having produced promptly from my pocket Tripp&#x27;s whiskey dollar and  unhesitatingly laying it in his hand.</p>
<p>THE HIGHER PRAGMATISM</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Where to go for wisdom has become a question of serious import.  The  ancients are discredited; Plato is boiler-plate; Aristotle is  tottering; Marcus Aurelius is reeling; Aesop has been copyrighted by  Indiana; Solomon is too solemn; you couldn&#x27;t get anything out of  Epictetus with a pick.</p>
<p>The ant, which for many years served as a model of intelligence and  industry in the school-readers, has been proven to be a doddering  idiot and a waster of time and effort.  The owl to-day is hooted at.   Chautauqua conventions have abandoned culture and adopted diabolo.   Graybeards give glowing testimonials to the venders of patent hair- restorers.  There are typographical errors in the almanacs published  by the daily newspapers.  College professors have become--</p>
<p>But there shall be no personalities.  To sit in classes, to delve into  the encyclopedia or the past-performances page, will not make us wise.   As the poet says, &quot;Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.&quot;  Wisdom is  dew, which, while we know it not, soaks into us, refreshes us, and  makes us grow.  Knowledge is a strong stream of water turned on us  through a hose.  It disturbs our roots.</p>
<p>Then, let us rather gather wisdom.  But how to do so requires  knowledge.  If we know a thing, we know it; but very often we are not  wise to it that we are wise, and--</p>
<p>But let&#x27;s go on with the story.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Once upon a time I found a ten-cent magazine lying on a bench in a  little city park.  Anyhow, that was the amount he asked me for when I  sat on the bench next to him.  He was a musty, dingy, and tattered  magazine, with some queer stories bound in him, I was sure.  He turned  out to be a scrap-book.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a newspaper reporter,&quot; I said to him, to try him.  &quot;I have been  detailed to write up some of the experiences of the unfortunate ones  who spend their evenings in this park.  May I ask you to what you  attribute your downfall in--&quot;</p>
<p>I was interrupted by a laugh from my purchase--a laugh so rusty and  unpractised that I was sure it had been his first for many a day.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, no,&quot; said he.  &quot;You ain&#x27;t a reporter.  Reporters don&#x27;t talk  that way.  They pretend to be one of us, and say they&#x27;ve just got in  on the blind baggage from St.  Louis.  I can tell a reporter on sight.   Us park bums get to be fine judges of human nature.  We sit here all  day and watch the people go by.  I can size up anybody who walks past  my bench in a way that would surprise you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;go on and tell me.  How do you size me up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should say,&quot; said the student of human nature with unpardonable  hesitation, &quot;that you was, say, in the contracting business--or maybe  worked in a store--or was a sign-painter.  You stopped in the park to  finish your cigar, and thought you&#x27;d get a little free monologue out  of me.  Still, you might be a plasterer or a lawyer--it&#x27;s getting kind  of dark, you see.  And your wife won&#x27;t let you smoke at home.&quot;</p>
<p>I frowned gloomily.</p>
<p>&quot;But, judging again,&quot; went on the reader of men, &quot;I&#x27;d say you ain&#x27;t  got a wife.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said I, rising restlessly.  &quot;No, no, no, I ain&#x27;t.  But I will  have, by the arrows of Cupid! That is, if--&quot;</p>
<p>My voice must have trailed away and muffled itself in uncertainty and  despair.</p>
<p>&quot;I see you have a story yourself,&quot; said the dusty vagrant--impudently,  it seemed to me.  &quot;Suppose you take your dime back and spin your yarn  for me.  I&#x27;m interested myself in the ups and downs of unfortunate  ones who spend their evenings in the park.&quot;</p>
<p>Somehow, that amused me.  I looked at the frowsy derelict with more  interest.  I did have a story.  Why not tell it to him?  I had told  none of my friends.  I had always been a reserved and bottled-up man.   It was psychical timidity or sensitiveness-perhaps both.  And I smiled  to myself in wonder when I felt an impulse to confide in this stranger  and vagabond.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack,&quot; said I.</p>
<p>&quot;Mack,&quot; said he.</p>
<p>&quot;Mack,&quot; said I, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want the dime back in advance ?&quot; said he.</p>
<p>I handed him a dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;The dime,&quot; said I, &quot;was the price of listening to your story.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right on the point of the jaw,&quot; said he.  &quot;Go on.&quot;</p>
<p>And then, incredible as it may seem to the lovers in the world who  confide their sorrows only to the night wind and the gibbous moon, I  laid bare my secret to that wreck of all things that you would have  supposed to be in sympathy with love.</p>
<p>I told him of the days and weeks and months that I had spent in  adoring Mildred Telfair.  I spoke of my despair, my grievous days and  wakeful nights, my dwindling hopes and distress of mind.  I even  pictured to this night-prowler her beauty and dignity, the great sway  she had in society, and the magnificence of her life as the elder  daughter of an ancient race whose pride overbalanced the dollars of  the city&#x27;s millionaires.</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#x27;t you cop the lady out?&quot; asked Mack, bringing me down to  earth and dialect again.</p>
<p>I explained to him that my worth was so small, my income so minute,  and my fears so large that I hadn&#x27;t the courage to speak to her of my  worship.  I told him that in her presence I could only blush and  stammer, and that she looked upon me with a wonderful, maddening smile  of amusement.</p>
<p>&quot;She kind of moves in the professional class, don&#x27;t she?&quot; asked Mack.</p>
<p>&quot;The Telfair family--&quot; I began, haughtily.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean professional beauty,&quot; said my hearer.</p>
<p>&quot;She is greatly and widely admired,&quot; I answered, cautiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Any sisters?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know any more girls?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, several,&quot; I answered.  &quot;And a few others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; said Mack, &quot;tell me one thing--can you hand out the dope to  other girls?  Can you chin &#x27;em and make matinee eyes at &#x27;em and  squeeze &#x27;em?  You know what I mean.  You&#x27;re just shy when it comes to  this particular dame--the professional beauty--ain&#x27;t that right ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In a way you have outlined the situation with approximate truth,&quot; I  admitted.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought so,&quot; said Mack, grimly.  &quot;Now, that reminds me of my own  case.  I&#x27;ll tell you about it.&quot;</p>
<p>I was indignant, but concealed it.  What was this loafer&#x27;s case or  anybody&#x27;s case compared with mine?  Besides, I had given him a dollar  and ten cents.</p>
<p>&quot;Feel my muscle,&quot; said my companion, suddenly, flexing his biceps.  I  did so mechanically.  The fellows in gyms are always asking you to do  that.  His arm was as hard as cast-iron.</p>
<p>&quot;Four years ago,&quot; said Mack, &quot;I could lick any man in New York outside  of the professional ring.  Your case and mine is just the same.  I  come from the West Side--between Thirtieth and Fourteenth--I won&#x27;t  give the number on the door.  I was a scrapper when I was ten, and  when I was twenty no amateur in the city could stand up four rounds  with me.  &#x27;S a fact.  You know Bill McCarty?  No?  He managed the  smokers for some of them swell clubs.  Well, I knocked out everything  Bill brought up before me.  I was a middle-weight, but could train  down to a welter when necessary.  I boxed all over the West Side at  bouts and benefits and private entertainments, and was never put out  once.</p>
<p>&quot;But, say, the first time I put my foot in the ring with a  professional I was no more than a canned lobster.  I dunno how it was- -I seemed to lose heart.  I guess I got too much imagination.  There  was a formality and publieness about it that kind of weakened my  nerve.  I never won a fight in the ring.  Light-weights and all kinds  of scrubs used to sign up with my manager and then walk up and tap me  on the wrist and see me fall.  The minute I seen the crowd and a lot  of gents in evening clothes down in front, and seen a professional  come inside the ropes, I got as weak as ginger-ale.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, it wasn&#x27;t long till I couldn&#x27;t get no backers, and I  didn&#x27;t have any more chances to fight a professional--or many  amateurs, either.  But lemme tell you--I was as good as most men  inside the ring or out.  It was just that dumb, dead feeling I had  when I was up against a regular that always done me up.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, after I had got out of the business, I got a mighty grouch  on.  I used to go round town licking private citizens and all kinds of  unprofessionals just to please myself.  I&#x27;d lick cops in dark streets  and car-conductors and cab-drivers and draymen whenever I could start  a row with &#x27;em.  It didn&#x27;t make any difference how big they were, or  how much science they had, I got away with &#x27;em.  If I&#x27;d only just have  had the confidence in the ring that I had beating up the best men  outside of it, I&#x27;d be wearing black pearls and heliotrope silk socks  to-day.</p>
<p>&quot;One evening I was walking along near the Bowery, thinking about  things, when along comes a slumming-party.  About six or seven they  was, all in swallowtails, and these silk hats that don&#x27;t shine.  One  of the gang kind of shoves me off the sidewalk.  I hadn&#x27;t had a scrap  in three days, and I just says, &#x27;De-lighted!&#x27; and hits him back of the  ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we had it.  That Johnnie put up as decent a little fight as  you&#x27;d want to see in the moving pictures.  It was on a side street,  and no cops around.  The other guy had a lot of science, but it only  took me about six minutes to lay him out.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the swallowtails dragged him up against some steps and began  to fan him.  Another one of &#x27;em comes over to me and says:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Young man, do you know what you&#x27;ve done?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Oh, beat it,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I&#x27;ve done nothing but a little punching-bag  work.  Take Freddy back to Yale and tell him to quit studying  sociology on the wrong side of the sidewalk.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;My good fellow,&#x27; says he, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know who you are, but I&#x27;d like  to.  You&#x27;ve knocked out Reddy Burns, the champion middle-weight of the  world!  He came to New York yesterday, to try to get a match on with  Jim Jeifries.  If you--&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;But when I come out of my faint I was laying on the floor in a drug- store saturated with aromatic spirits of ammonia.  If I&#x27;d known that  was Reddy Burns, I&#x27;d have got down in the gutter and crawled past him  instead of handing him one like I did.  Why, if I&#x27;d ever been in a  ring and seen him climbing over the ropes, I&#x27;d have been all to the  sal volatile.</p>
<p>&quot;So that&#x27;s what imagination does,&quot; concluded Mack.  &quot;And, as I said,  your case and mine is simultaneous.  You&#x27;ll never win out.  You can&#x27;t  go up against the professionals.  I tell you, it&#x27;s a park bench for  yours in this romance business.&quot;</p>
<p>Mack, the pessimist, laughed harshly.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid I don&#x27;t see the parallel,&quot; I said, coldly.  &quot;I have only a  very slight acquaintance with the prize-ring.&quot;</p>
<p>The derelict touched my sleeve with his forefinger, for emphasis, as  he explained his parable.</p>
<p>&quot;Every man,&quot; said he, with some dignity, &quot;has got his lamps on  something that looks good to him.  With you, it&#x27;s this dame that  you&#x27;re afraid to say your say to.  With me, it was to win out in the  ring.  Well, you&#x27;ll lose just like I did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you think I shall lose?&quot; I asked warmly.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Cause,&quot; said he, &quot;you&#x27;re afraid to go in the ring.  You dassen&#x27;t  stand up before a professional.  Your case and mine is just the same.   You&#x27;re a amateur; and that means that you&#x27;d better keep outside of the  ropes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I must be going,&quot; I said, rising and looking with elaborate  care at my watch.</p>
<p>When I was twenty feet away the park-bencher called to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Much obliged for the dollar,&quot; he said.  &quot;And for the dime.  But  you&#x27;ll never get &#x27;er.  You&#x27;re in the amateur class.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Serves you right,&quot; I said to myself, &quot;for hobnobbing with a tramp.   His impudence!&quot;</p>
<p>But, as I walked, his words seemed to repeat themselves over and over  again in my brain.  I think I even grew angry at the man.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll show him!&quot; I finally said, aloud.  &quot;I&#x27;ll show him that I can  fight Reddy Burns, too--even knowing who he is.&quot;</p>
<p>I hurried to a telephone-booth and rang up the Telfair residence.</p>
<p>A soft, sweet voice answered.  Didn&#x27;t I know that voice?  My hand  holding the receiver shook.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that you?&quot; said I, employing the foolish words that form the  vocabulary of every talker through the telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, this is I,&quot; came back the answer in the low, clear-cut tones  that are an inheritance of the Telfairs.  &quot;Who is it, please?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s me,&quot; said I, less ungrammatically than egotistically.  &quot;It&#x27;s me,  and I&#x27;ve got a few things that I want to say to you right now and  immediately and straight to the point.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me,&quot; said the voice.  &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s you, Mr.  Arden!&quot;</p>
<p>I wondered if any accent on the first word was intended; Mildred was  fine at saying things that you had to study out afterward.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said I.  &quot;I hope so.  And now to come down to brass tacks.&quot;  I  thought that rather a vernacularism, if there is such a word, as soon  as I had said it; but I didn&#x27;t stop to apologize.  &quot;You know, of  course, that I love you, and that I have been in that idiotic state  for a long time.  I don&#x27;t want any more foolish ness about it--that is, I mean I want an answer from you right now.   Will you marry me or not?  Hold the wire, please.  Keep out, Central.   Hello, hello!  Will you, or will you not.?&quot;</p>
<p>That was just the uppercut for Reddy Burns&#x27; chin.  The answer came  back:</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Phil, dear, of course I will!  I didn&#x27;t know that you--that is,  you never said--oh, come up to the house, please--I can&#x27;t say what I  want to over the &#x27;phone.  You are so importunate.  But please come up  to the house, won&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>Would I?</p>
<p>I rang the bell of the Telfair house violently.  Some sort of a human  came to the door and shooed me into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; said I to myself, looking at the ceiling, &quot;any one can  learn from any one.  That was a pretty good philosophy of Mack&#x27;s,  anyhow.  He didn&#x27;t take advantage of his experience, but I get the  benefit of it.  If you want to get into the professional class, you&#x27;ve  got to--&quot;</p>
<p>I stopped thinking then.  Some one was coming down the stairs.  My  knees began to shake.  I knew then how Mack had felt when a  professional began to climb over the ropes.</p>
<p>I looked around foolishly for a door or a window by which I might  escape.  If it had been any other girl approaching, I mightn&#x27;t have-- But just then the door opened, and Bess, Mildred&#x27;s younger sister,  came in.  I&#x27;d never seen her look so much like a glorified angel.  She  walked straight tip to me, and--and--I&#x27;d never noticed before what  perfectly wonderful eyes and hair Elizabeth Telfair had.</p>
<p>&quot;Phil,&quot; she said, in the Telfair, sweet, thrilling tones, &quot;why didn&#x27;t  you tell me about it before?  I thought it was sister you wanted all  the time, until you telephoned to me a few minutes ago!&quot;</p>
<p>I suppose Mack and I always will be hopeless amateurs.  But, as the  thing has turned out in my case, I&#x27;m mighty glad of it.</p>
<p>BEST-SELLER</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>One day last summer I went to Pittsburgh--well, I had to go there on  business.</p>
<p>My chair-car was profitably well filled with people of the kind one  usually sees on chair-cars.  Most of them were ladies in brown-silk  dresses cut with square yokes, with lace insertion, and dotted veils,  who refused to have the windows raised.  Then there was the usual  number of men who looked as if they might be in almost any business  and going almost anywhere.  Some students of human nature can look at  a man in a Pullman and tell you where he is from, his occupation and  his stations in life, both flag and social; but I never could.  The  only way I can correctly judge a fellow-traveller is when the train is  held up by robbers, or when he reaches at the same time I do for the  last towel in the dressing-room of the sleeper.</p>
<p>The porter came and brushed the collection of soot on the window-sill  off to the left knee of my trousers.  I removed it with an air of  apology.  The temperature was eighty-eight.  One of the dotted-veiled  ladies demanded the closing of two more ventilators, and spoke loudly  of Interlaken.  I leaned back idly in chair No.  7, and looked with  the tepidest curiosity at the small, black, bald-spotted head just  visible above the back of No.  9.</p>
<p>Suddenly No.  9 hurled a book to the floor between his chair and the  window, and, looking, I saw that it was The Rose-Lady and Trevelyan,  one of the best-selling novels of the present day.  And then the  critic or Philistine, whichever he was, veered his chair toward the  window, and I knew him at once for John A.  Pescud, of Pittsburgh,  travelling salesman for a plate-glass company--an old acquaintance  whom I had not seen in two years.</p>
<p>In two minutes we were faced, had shaken hands, and had finished with  such topics as rain, prosperity, health, residence, and destination.   Politics might have followed next; but I was not so ill-fated.</p>
<p>I wish you might know John A.  Pescud.  He is of the stuff that heroes  are not often lucky enough to be made of.  He is a small man with a  wide smile, and an eye that seems to be fixed upon that little red  spot on the end of your nose.  I never saw him wear but one kind of  necktie, and he believes in cuff-holders and button-shoes.  He is as  hard and true as anything ever turned out by the Cambria Steel Works;  and he believes that as soon as Pittsburgh makes smoke-consumers  compulsory, St.  Peter will come down and sit at the foot of  Smithfield Street, and let somebody else attend to the gate up in the  branch heaven.  He believes that &quot;our&quot; plate-glass is the most  important commodity in the world, and that when a man is in his home  town he ought to be decent and law-abiding.</p>
<p>During my acquaintance with him in the City of Diurnal Night I had  never known his views on life, romance, literature, and ethics.  We  had browsed, during our meetings, on local topics, and then parted,  after Chateau Margaux, Irish stew, flannel-cakes, cottage-pudding, and  coffee (hey, there!--with milk separate).  Now I was to get more of  his ideas.  By way of facts, he told me that business had picked up  since the party conventions, and that he was going to get off at  Coketown.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; said Pescud, stirring his discarded book with the toe of his  right shoe, &quot;did you ever read one of these best-sellers?  I mean the  kind where the hero is an American swell--sometimes even from Chicago- -who falls in love with a royal princess from Europe who is travelling  under an alias, and follows her to her father&#x27;s kingdom or  principality?  I guess you have.  They&#x27;re all alike.  Sometimes this  going-away masher is a Washington newspaper correspondent, and  sometimes he is a Van Something from New York, or a Chicago wheat- broker worthy fifty millions.  But he&#x27;s always ready to break into the  king row of any foreign country that sends over their queens and  princesses to try the new plush seats on the Big Four or the B.  and  0.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any other reason in the book for their  being here.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this fellow chases the royal chair-warmer home, as I said, and  finds out who she is.  He meets here on the corso or the strasse one  evening and gives us ten pages of conversation.  She reminds him of  the difference in their stations, and that gives him a chance to ring  in three solid pages about America&#x27;s uncrowned sovereigns.  If you&#x27;d  take his remarks and set &#x27;em to music, and then take the music away  from &#x27;em, they&#x27;d sound exactly like one of George Cohan&#x27;s songs.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you know how it runs on, if you ve read any of &#x27;em--he slaps  the king&#x27;s Swiss body-guards around like everything whenever they get  in his way.  He&#x27;s a great fencer, too.  Now, I&#x27;ve known of some  Chicago men who were pretty notorious fences, but I never heard of any  fencers coming from there.  He stands on the first landing of the  royal staircase in Castle Schutzenfestenstein with a gleaming rapier  in his hand, and makes a Baltimore broil of six platoons of traitors  who come to massacre the said king.  And then he has to fight duels  with a couple of chancellors, and foil a plot by four Austrian  archdukes to seize the kingdom for a gasoline-station.</p>
<p>&quot;But the great scene is when his rival for the princess&#x27; hand, Count  Feodor, attacks him between the portcullis and the ruined chapel,  armed with a mitrailleuse, a yataghan, and a couple of Siberian  bloodhounds.  This scene is what runs the best-seller into the twenty- ninth edition before the publisher has had time to draw a check for  the advance royalties.</p>
<p>&quot;The American hero shucks his coat and throws it over the heads of the  bloodhounds, gives the mitrailleuse a slap with his mitt, says &#x27;Yah!&#x27;  to the yataghan, and lands in Kid McCoy&#x27;s best style on the count&#x27;s  left eye.  Of course, we have a neat little prize-fight right then and  there.  The count--in order to make the go possible--seems to be an  expert at the art of self-defence, himself; and here we have the  Corbett-Sullivan fight done over into literature.  The book ends with  the broker and the princess doing a John Cecil Clay cover under the  linden-trees on the Gorgonzola Walk.  That winds up the love-story  plenty good enough.  But I notice that the book dodges the final  issue.  Even a best-seller has sense enough to shy at either leaving a  Chicago grain broker on the throne of Lobsterpotsdam or bringing over  a real princess to eat fish and potato salad in an Italian chalet on  Michigan Avenue.  What do you think about &#x27;em?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said I, &quot;I hardly know, John.  There&#x27;s a saying: &#x27;Love levels  all ranks,&#x27; you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Pescud, &quot;but these kind of love-stories are rank--on the  level.  I know something about literature, even if I am in plate- glass.  These kind of books are wrong, and yet I never go into a train  but what they pile &#x27;em up on me.  No good can come out of an  international clinch between the Old-World aristocracy and one of us  fresh Americans.  When people in real life marry, they generally hunt  up somebody in their own station.  A fellow usually picks out a girl  that went to the same high-school and belonged to the same singing- society that he did.  When young millionaires fall in love, they  always select the chorus-girl that likes the same kind of sauce on the  lobster that he does.  Washington newspaper correspondents always many  widow ladies ten years older than themselves who keep boarding-houses.   No, sir, you can&#x27;t make a novel sound right to me when it makes one of  C.  D.  Gibson&#x27;s bright young men go abroad and turn kingdoms upside  down just because he&#x27;s a Taft American aud took a course at a  gymnasium.  And listen how they talk, too!&quot;</p>
<p>Pescud picked up the best-seller and hunted his page.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen at this,&quot; said he.  &quot;Trevelyan is chinning with the Princess  Alwyna at the back end of the tulip-garden.  This is how it goes:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Say not so, dearest and sweetest of earth&#x27;s fairest flowers.  Would  I aspire?  You are a star set high above me in a royal heaven; I am  only--myself.  Yet I am a man, and I have a heart to do and dare.  I  have no title save that of an uncrowned sovereign; but I have an arm  and a sword that yet might free Schutzenfestenstein from the plots of  traitors.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Think of a Chicago man packing a sword, and talking about freeing  anything that sounded as much like canned pork as that!  He&#x27;d be much  more likely to fight to have an import duty put on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I understand you, John,&quot; said I.  &quot;You want fiction-writers  to be consistent with their scenes and characters.  They shouldn&#x27;t mix  Turkish pashas with Vermont farmers, or English dukes with Long Island  clam-diggers, or Italian countesses with Montana cowboys, or  Cincinnati brewery agents with the rajahs of India.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or plain business men with aristocracy high above &#x27;em,&quot; added Pescud.   &quot;It don&#x27;t jibe.  People are divided into classes, whether we admit it  or not, and it&#x27;s everybody&#x27;s impulse to stick to their own class.   They do it, too.  I don&#x27;t see why people go to work and buy hundreds  of thousands of books like that.  You don&#x27;t see or hear of any such  didoes and capers in real life.&quot;</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>&quot;Well, John,&quot; said I, &quot;I haven&#x27;t read a best-seller in a long time.   Maybe I&#x27;ve had notions about them somewhat like yours.  But tell me  more about yourself.  Getting along all right with the company?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bully,&quot; said Pescud, brightening at once.  &quot;I&#x27;ve had my salary raised  twice since I saw you, and I get a commission, too.  I&#x27;ve bought a  neat slice of real estate out in the East End, and have run up a house  on it.  Next year the firm is going to sell me some shares of stock.   Oh, I&#x27;m in on the line of General Prosperity, no matter who&#x27;s  elected!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Met your affinity yet, John?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I didn&#x27;t tell you about that, did I?&quot; said Pescud with a broader  grin.</p>
<p>&quot;0-ho!&quot; I said.  &quot;So you&#x27;ve taken time enough off from your plate- glass to have a romance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; said John.  &quot;No romance--nothing like that!  But I&#x27;ll tell  you about it.</p>
<p>&quot;I was on the south-bound, going to Cincinnati, about eighteen months  ago, when I saw, across the aisle, the finest-looking girl I&#x27;d ever  laid eyes on.  Nothing spectacular, you know, but just the sort you  want for keeps.  Well, I never was up to the flirtation business,  either handkerchief, automobile, postage-stamp, or door-step, and she  wasn&#x27;t the kind to start anything.  She read a book and minded her  business, which was to make the world prettier and better just by  residing on it.  I kept on looking out of the side doors of my eyes,  and finally the proposition got out of the Pullman class into a case  of a cottage with a lawn and vines running over the porch.  I never  thought of speaking to her, but I let the plate-glass business go to  smash for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;She changed cars at Cincinnati, and took a sleeper to Louisville over  the L.  and N.  There she bought another ticket, and went on through  Shelbyville, Frankfort, and Lexington.  Along there I began to have a  hard time keeping up with her.  The trains came along when they  pleased, and didn&#x27;t seem to be going anywhere in particular, except to  keep on the track and the right of way as much as possible.  Then they  began to stop at junctions instead of towns, and at last they stopped  altogether.  I&#x27;ll bet Pinkerton would outbid the plate-glass people  for my services any time if they knew how I managed to shadow that  young lady.  I contrived to keep out of her sight as much as I could,  but I never lost track of her.</p>
<p>&quot;The last station she got off at was away down in Virginia, about six  in the afternoon.  There were about fifty houses and four hundred  niggers in sight.  The rest was red mud, mules, and speckled hounds.</p>
<p>&quot;A tall old man, with a smooth face and white hair, looking as proud  as Julius Caesar and Roscoe Conkling on the same post-card, was there  to meet her.  His clothcs were frazzled, but I didn&#x27;t notice that till  later.  He took her little satchel, and they started over the plank- walks and went up a road along the hill.  I kept along a piece behind  &#x27;em, trying to look like I was hunting a garnet ring in the sand that  my sister had lost at a picnic the previous Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;They went in a gate on top of the hill.  It nearly took my breath  away when I looked up.  Up there in the biggest grove I ever saw was a  tremendous house with round white pillars about a thousand feet high,  and the yard was so full of rose-bushes and box-bushes and lilacs that  you couldn&#x27;t have seen the house if it hadn&#x27;t been as big as the  Capitol at Washington.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Here&#x27;s where I have to trail,&#x27; says I to myself.  &quot;I thought before  that she seemed to be in moderate circumstances, at least.  This must  be the Governor&#x27;s mansion, or the Agricultural Building of a new  World&#x27;s Fair, anyhow.  I&#x27;d better go back to the village and get  posted by the postmaster, or drug the druggist for some information.</p>
<p>&quot;In the village I found a pine hotel called the Bay View House.  The  only excuse for the name was a bay horse grazing in the front yard.  I  set my sample-case down, and tried to be ostensible.  I told the  landlord I was taking orders for plate-glass.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I don&#x27;t want no plates,&#x27; says he, &#x27;but I do need another glass  molasses-pitcher.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;By-and-by I got him down to local gossip and answering questions.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Why,&#x27; says he, &#x27;I thought everybody knowed who lived in the big  white house on the hill.  It&#x27;s Colonel Allyn, the biggest man and the  finest quality in Virginia, or anywhere else.  They&#x27;re the oldest  family in the State.  That was his daughter that got off the train.   She&#x27;s been up to Illinois to see her aunt, who is sick.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I registered at the hotel, and on the third day I caught the young  lady walking in the front yard, down next to the paling fence.  I  stopped and raised my hat--there wasn&#x27;t any other way.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Excuse me,&#x27; says I, &#x27;can you tell me where Mr.  Hinkle lives?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;She looks at me as cool as if I was the man come to see about the  weeding of the garden, but I thought I saw just a slight twinkle of  fun in her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;No one of that name lives in Birchton,&#x27; says she.  &#x27;That is,&#x27; she  goes on, &#x27;as far as I know.  Is the gentleman you are seeking white?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that tickled me.  &#x27;No kidding,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I&#x27;m not looking for  smoke, even if I do come from Pittsburgh.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You are quite a distance from home,&#x27; says she.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;d have gone a thousand miles farther,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Not if you hadn&#x27;t waked up when the train started in Shelbyville,&#x27;  says she; and then she turned almost as red as one of the roses on the  bushes in the yard.  I remembered I had dropped off to sleep on a  bench in the Shelbyville station, waiting to see which train she took,  and only just managed to wake up in time.</p>
<p>&quot;And then I told her why I had come, as respectful and earnest as I  could.  And I told her everything about myself, and what I was making,  and how that all I asked was just to get acquainted with her and try  to get her to like me.</p>
<p>&quot;She smiles a little, and blushes some, but her eyes never get mixed  up.  They look straight at whatever she&#x27;s talking to.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I never had any one talk like this to me before, Mr.  Pescud,&#x27; says  she.  &#x27;What did you say your name is--John?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;John A.,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;And you came mighty near missing the train at Powhatan Junction,  too,&#x27; says she, with a laugh that sounded as good as a mileage-book to  me.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;How did you know?&#x27; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Men are very clumsy,&#x27; said she.  &#x27;I knew you were on every train.  I  thought you were going to speak to me, and I&#x27;m glad you didn&#x27;t.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Then we had more talk; and at last a kind of proud, serious look came  on her face, and she turned and pointed a finger at the big house.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;The Allyns,&#x27; says she, &#x27;have lived in Elmcroft for a hundred years.   We are a proud family.  Look at that mansion.  It has fifty rooms.   See the pillars and porches and balconies.  The ceilings in the  reception-rooms and the ball-room are twenty-eight feet high.  My  father is a lineal descendant of belted earls.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I belted one of &#x27;em once in the Duquesne Hotel, in Pittsburgh,&#x27; says  I, &#x27;and he didn&#x27;t offer to resent it.  He was there dividing his  attentions between Monongahela whiskey and heiresses, and he got  fresh.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Of course,&#x27; she goes on, &#x27;my father wouldn&#x27;t allow a drummer to set  his foot in Elmeroft.  If he knew that I was talking to one over the  fence he would lock me in my room.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Would you let me come there?&#x27; says I.  &#x27;Would you talk to me if I  was to call?  For,&#x27; I goes on, &#x27;if you said I might come and see you,  the earls might be belted or suspendered, or pinned up with safety- pins, as far as I am concerned.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I must not talk to you,&#x27; she says, &#x27;because we have not been  introduced.  It is not exactly proper.  So I will say good-bye, Mr.--&#x27; &quot;&#x27;Say the name,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;You haven&#x27;t forgotten it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Pescud,&#x27; says she, a little mad.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;The rest of the name!&#x27; I demands, cool as could be.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;John,&#x27; says she.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;John-what?&#x27; I says.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;John A.,&#x27; says she, with her head high.  &#x27;Are you through, now?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I&#x27;m coming to see the belted earl to-morrow,&#x27; I says.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;He&#x27;ll feed you to his fox-hounds,&#x27; says she, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;If he does, it&#x27;ll improve their running,&#x27; says I.  &#x27;I&#x27;m something of  a hunter myself.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I must be going in now,&#x27; says she.  &#x27;I oughtn&#x27;t to have spoken to  you at all.  I hope you&#x27;ll have a pleasant trip back to Minneapolis -- or Pittsburgh, was it?  Good-bye!&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Good-night,&#x27; says I, &#x27;and it wasn&#x27;t Minneapolis.  What&#x27;s your name,  first, please?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;She hesitated.  Then she pulled a leaf off a bush, and said:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;My name is Jessie,&#x27; says she.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Good-night, Miss Allyn,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;The next morning at eleven, sharp, I rang the door-bell of that  World&#x27;s Fair main building.  After about three-quarters of an hour an  old nigger man about eighty showed up and asked what I wanted.  I gave  him my business card, and said I wanted to see the colonel.  He showed  me in.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, did you ever crack open a wormy English walnut?  That&#x27;s what  that house was like.  There wasn&#x27;t enough furniture in it to fill an  eight-dollar flat.  Some old horsehair lounges and three-legged chairs  and some framed ancestors on the walls were all that met the eye.  But  when Colonel Allyn comes in, the place seemed to light up.  You could  almost hear a band playing, and see a bunch of old-timers in wigs and  white stockings dancing a quadrille.  It was the style of him,  although he had on the same shabby clothes I saw him wear at the  station.</p>
<p>&quot;For about nine seconds he had me rattled, and I came mighty near  getting cold feet and trying to sell him some plate-glass.  But I got  my nerve back pretty quick.  He asked me to sit down, and I told him  everything.  I told him how I followed his daughter from Cincinnati,  and what I did it for, and all about my salary and prospects, and  explained to him my little code of living--to be always decent and  right in your home town; and when you&#x27;re on the road, never take more  than four glasses of beer a day or play higher than a twenty-five-cent  limit.  At first I thought he was going to throw me out of the window,  but I kept on talking.  Pretty soon I got a chance to tell him that  story about the Western Congressman who had lost his pocket-book and  the grass widow--you remember that story.  Well, that got him to  laughing, and I&#x27;ll bet that was the first laugh those ancestors and  horsehair sofas had heard in many a day.</p>
<p>&quot;We talked two hours.  I told him everything I knew; and then he began  to ask questions, and I told him the rest.  All I asked of him was to  give me a chance.  If I couldn&#x27;t make a hit with the little lady, I&#x27;d  clear out, and not bother any more.  At last he says:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;There was a Sir Courtenay Pescud in the time of Charles I, if I  remember rightly.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;If there was,&#x27; says I, &#x27;he can&#x27;t claim kin with our bunch.  We&#x27;ve  always lived in and around Pittsburgh.  I&#x27;ve got an uncle in the real- estate business, and one in trouble somewhere out in Kansas.  You can  inquire about any of the rest of us from anybody in old Smoky Town,  and get satisfactory replies.  Did you ever run across that story  about the captain of the whaler who tried to make a sailor say his  prayers?&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It occurs to me that I have never been so fortunate,&#x27; says the  colonel.</p>
<p>&quot;So I told it to him.  Laugh!  I was wishing to myself that he was a  customer.  What a bill of glass I&#x27;d sell him!  And then he says:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;The relating of anecdotes and humorous occurrences has always seemed  to me, Mr.  Pescud, to be a particularly agreeable way of promoting  and perpetuating amenities between friends.  With your permission, I  will relate to you a fox-hunting story with which I was personally  connected, and which may furnish you some amusement.&#x27;</p>
<p>So he tells it.  It takes forty minutes by the watch.  Did I laugh?   Well, say!  When I got my face straight he calls in old Pete, the  super-annuated darky, and sends him down to the hotel to bring up my  valise.  It was Elmcroft for me while I was in the town.</p>
<p>&quot;Two evenings later I got a chance to speak a word with Miss Jessie  alone on the porch while the colonel was thinking up another story.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s going to be a fine evening,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;He&#x27;s coming,&#x27; says she.  &#x27;He&#x27;s going to tell you, this time, the  story about the old negro and the green watermelons.  It always comes  after the one about the Yankees and the game rooster.  There was  another time,&#x27; she goes on, &#x27;that you nearly got left--it was at  Pulaski City.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Yes,&#x27; says I, &#x27;I remember.  My foot slipped as I was jumping on the  step, and I nearly tumbled off.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I know,&#x27; says she.  &#x27;And--and I--I was afraid you had, John A.  I  was afraid you had.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;And then she skips into the house through one of the big windows.&quot;</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>&quot;Coketown!&quot; droned the porter, making his way through the slowing car.</p>
<p>Pescud gathered his hat and baggage with the leisurely promptness of  an old traveller.</p>
<p>&quot;I married her a year ago,&quot; said John.  &quot;I told you I built a house in  the East End.  The belted--I mean the colonel--is there, too.  I find  him waiting at the gate whenever I get back from a trip to hear any  new story I might have picked up on the road.&quot;</p>
<p>I glanced out of the window.  Coketown was nothing more than a ragged  hillside dotted with a score of black dismal huts propped up against  dreary mounds of slag and clinkers.  It rained in slanting torrents,  too, and the rills foamed and splashed down through the black mud to  the railroad-tracks.</p>
<p>&quot;You won&#x27;t sell much plate-glass here, John,&quot; said I.  &quot;Why do you get  off at this end-o&#x27;-the-world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Pescud, &quot;the other day I took Jessie for a little trip to  Philadelphia, and coming back she thought she saw some petunias in a  pot in one of those windows over there just like some she used to  raise down in the old Virginia home.  So I thought I&#x27;d drop off here  for the night, and see if I could dig up some of the cuttings or  blossoms for her.  Here we are.  Good-night, old man.  I gave you the  address.  Come out and see us when you have time.&quot;</p>
<p>The train moved forward.  One of the dotted brown ladies insisted on  having windows raised, now that the rain beat against them.  The  porter came along with his mysterious wand and began to light the car.</p>
<p>I glanced downward and saw the best-seller.  I picked it up and set it  carefully farther along on the floor of the car, where the rain-drops  would not fall upon it.  And then, suddenly, I smiled, and seemed to  see that life has no geographical metes and bounds.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-luck to you, Trevelyan,&quot; I said.  &quot;And may you get the petunias  for your princess!&quot;</p>
<p>RUS IN URBE</p>
<p>Considering men in relation to money, there are three kinds whom I  dislike: men who have more money than they can spend; men who have  more money than they do spend; and men who spend more money than they  have.  Of the three varieties, I believe I have the least liking for  the first.  But, as a man, I liked Spencer Grenville North pretty  well, although he had something like two or ten or thirty millions-- I&#x27;ve forgotten exactly how many.</p>
<p>I did not leave town that summer.  I usually went down to a village on  the south shore of Long Island.  The place was surrounded by duck- farms, and the ducks and dogs and whippoorwills and rusty windmills  made so much noise that I could sleep as peacefully as if I were in my  own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in New York.  But that  summer I did not go.  Remember that.  One of my friends asked me why I  did not.  I replied:</p>
<p>&quot;Because, old man, New York is the finest summer resort in the world.&quot;   You have heard that phrase before.  But that is what I told him.</p>
<p>I was press-agent that year for Binkly &amp; Bing, the theatrical managers  and producers.  Of course you know what a press-agent is.  Well, he is  not.  That is the secret of being one.</p>
<p>Binkly was touring France in his new C.  &amp; N.  Williamson car, and  Bing had gone to Scotland to learn curling, which he seemed to  associate in his mind with hot tongs rather than with ice.  Before  they left they gave me June and July, on salary, for my vacation,  which act was in accord with their large spirit of liberality.  But I  remained in New York, which I had decided was the finest summer resort  in--</p>
<p>But I said that before.</p>
<p>On July the 10th, North came to town from his camp in the Adirondacks.   Try to imagine a camp with sixteen rooms, plumbing, eiderdown quilts,  a butler, a garage, solid silver plate, and a long-distance telephone.   Of course it was in the woods--if Mr.  Pinchot wants to preserve the  forests let him give every citizen two or ten or thirty million  dollars, and the trees will all gather around the summer camps, as the  Birnam woods came to Dunsinane, and be preserved.</p>
<p>North came to see me in my three rooms and bath, extra charge for  light when used extravagantly or all night.  He slapped me on the back  (I would rather have my shins kicked any day), and greeted me with  out-door obstreperousness and revolting good spirits.  He was  insolently brown and healthy-looking, and offensively well dressed.</p>
<p>&quot;Just ran down for a few days,&quot; said he, &quot;to sign some papers and  stuff like that.  My lawyer wired me to come.  Well, you indolent  cockney, what are you doing in town?  I took a chance and telephoned,  and they said you were here.  What&#x27;s the matter with that Utopia on  Long Island where you used to take your typewriter and your villanous  temper every summer?  Anything wrong with the--er--swans, weren&#x27;t  they, that used to sing on the farms at night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ducks,&quot; said I.  &quot;The songs of swans are for luckier ears.  They swim  and curve their necks in artificial lakes on the estates of the  wealthy to delight the eyes of the favorites of Fortune.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Also in Central Park,&quot; said North, &quot;to delight the eyes of immigrants  and bummers.  I&#x27;ve seen em there lots of times.  But why are you in  the city so late in the summer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;New York City,&quot; I began to recite, &quot;is the finest sum--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you don&#x27;t,&quot; said North, emphatically.  &quot;You don&#x27;t spring that old  one on me.  I know you know better.  Man, you ought to have gone up  with us this summer.  The Prestons are there, and Tom Volney and the  Monroes and Lulu Stanford and the Miss Kennedy and her aunt that you  liked so well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never liked Miss Kennedy&#x27;s aunt,&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t say you did,&quot; said North.  &quot;We are having the greatest time  we&#x27;ve ever had.  The pickerel and trout are so ravenous that I believe  they would swallow your hook with a Montana copper-mine prospectus  fastened on it.  And we&#x27;ve a couple of electric launches; and I&#x27;ll  tell you what we do every night or two--we tow a rowboat behind each  one with a big phonograph and a boy to change the discs in &#x27;em.  On  the water, and twenty yards behind you, they are not so bad.  And  there are passably good roads through the woods where we go motoring.   I shipped two cars up there.  And the Pinecliff Inn is only three  miles away.  You know the Pinecliff.  Some good people are there this  season, and we run over to the dances twice a week.  Can&#x27;t you go back  with me for a week, old man?&quot;</p>
<p>I laughed.  &quot;Northy,&quot; said I--&quot;if I may be so familiar with a  millionaire, because I hate both the names Spencer and Grenville--your  invitation is meant kindly, but--the city in the summer-time for me.   Here, while the bourgeoisie is away, I can live as Nero lived-barring,  thank heaven, the fiddling-while the city burns at ninety in the  shade.  The tropics and the zones wait upon me like handmaidens.  I  sit under Florida palms and eat pomegranates while Boreas himself,  electrically conjured up, blows upon me his Arctic breath.  As for  trout, you know, yourself, that Jean, at Maurice&#x27;s, cooks them better  than any one else in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be advised,&quot; said North.  &quot;My chef has pinched the blue ribbon from  the lot.  He lays some slices of bacon inside the trout, wraps it all  in corn-husks--the husks of green corn, you know--buries them in hot  ashes and covers them with live coals.  We build fires on the bank of  the lake and have fish suppers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; said I.  &quot;And the servants bring down tables and chairs and  damask cloths, and you eat with silver forks.  I know the kind of  camps that you millionaires have.  And therc are champagne pails set  about, disgracing the wild flowers, and, no doubt, Madame Tetrazzini  to sing in the boat pavilion after the trout.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; said North, concernedly, &quot;we were never as bad as that.  We  did have a variety troupe up from the city three or four nights, but  they weren&#x27;t stars by as far as light can travel in the same length of  time.  I always like a few home comforts even when I&#x27;m roughing it.   But don&#x27;t tell me you prefer to stay in the city during summer.  I  don&#x27;t believe it.  If you do, why did you spend your summers there for  the last four years, even sneaking away from town on a night train,  and refusing to tell your friends where this Arcadian village was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because,&quot; said I, &quot;they might have followed me and discovered it.   But since then I have learned that Amaryllis has come to town.  The  coolest things, the freshest, the brightest, the choicest, are to be  found in the city.  If you&#x27;ve nothing on hand this evening I will show  you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m free,&quot; said North, &quot;and I have my light car outside.  I suppose,  since you&#x27;ve been converted to the town, that your idea of rural sport  is to have a little whirl between bicycle cops in Central Park and  then a mug of sticky ale in some stuffy rathskeller under a fan that  can&#x27;t stir up as many revolutions in a week as Nicaragua can in a  day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll begin with the spin through the Park, anyhow,&quot; I said.  I was  choking with the hot, stale air of my little apartment, and I wanted  that breath of the cool to brace me for the task of proving to my  friend that New York was the greatest--and so forth.</p>
<p>&quot;Where can you find air any fresher or purer than this?&quot; I asked, as  we sped into Central&#x27;s boskiest dell.</p>
<p>&quot;Air!&quot; said North, contemptuously.  &quot;Do you call this air?--this muggy  vapor, smelling of garbage and gasoline smoke.  Man, I wish you could  get one sniff of the real Adirondack article in the pine woods at  daylight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have heard of it,&quot; said I.  &quot;But for fragrance and tang and a joy  in the nostrils I would not give one puff of sea breeze across the  bay, down on my little boat dock on Long Island, for ten of your  turpentine-scented tornadoes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why,&quot; asked North, a little curiously, &quot;don&#x27;t you go there  instead of staying cooped up in this Greater Bakery?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because,&quot; said I, doggedly, &quot;I have discovered that New York is the  greatest summer--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t say that again,&quot; interrupted North, &quot;unless you&#x27;ve actually got  a job as General Passenger Agent of the Subway.  You can&#x27;t really  believe it.&quot;</p>
<p>I went to some trouble to try to prove my theory to my friend.  The  Weather Bureau and the season had conspired to make the argument  worthy of an able advocate.</p>
<p>The city seemed stretched on a broiler directly above the furnaces of  Avernus.  There was a kind of tepid gayety afoot and awheel in the  boulevards, mainly evinced by languid men strolling about in straw  hats and evening clothes, and rows of idle taxicabs with their flags  up, looking like a blockaded Fourth of July procession.  The hotels  kept up a specious brilliancy and hospitable outlook, but inside one  saw vast empty caverns, and the footrails at the bars gleamed brightly  from long disacquaintance with the sole-leather of customers.  In the  cross-town streets the steps of the old brownstone houses were  swarming with &quot;stoopers,&quot; that motley race hailing from sky-light room  and basement, bringing out their straw doorstep mats to sit and fill  the air with strange noises and opinions.</p>
<p>North and I dined on the top of a hotel; and here, for a few minutes,  I thought I had made a score.  An east wind, almost cool, blew across  the roofless roof.  A capable orchestra concealed in a bower of  wistaria played with sufficient judgment to make the art of music  probable and the art of conversation possible.</p>
<p>Some ladies in reproachless summer gowns at other tables gave  animation and color to the scene.  And an excellent dinner, mainly  from the refrigerator, seemed to successfully back my judgment as to  summer resorts.  But North grumbled all during the meal, and cursed  his lawyers and prated so of his confounded camp in the woods that I  began to wish he would go back there and leave me in my peaceful city  retreat.</p>
<p>After dining we went to a roof-garden vaudeville that was being much  praised.  There we found a good bill, an artificially cooled  atmosphere, cold drinks, prompt service, and a gay, well-dressed  audience.  North was bored.</p>
<p>&quot;If this isn&#x27;t comfortable enough for you on the hottest August night  for five years,&quot; I said, a little sarcastically, &quot;you might think  about the kids down in Delancey and Hester streets lying out on the  fire-escapes with their tongues hanging out, trying to get a breath of  air that hasn&#x27;t been fried on both sides.  The contrast might increase  your enjoyment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t talk Socialism,&quot; said North.  &quot;I gave five hundred dollars to  the free ice fund on the first of May.  I&#x27;m contrasting these stale,  artificial, hollow, wearisome &#x27;amusements&#x27; with the enjoyment a man  can get in the woods.  You should see the firs and pines do skirt- dances during a storm; and lie down flat and drink out of a mountain  branch at the end of a day&#x27;s tramp after the deer.  That&#x27;s the only  way to spend a summer.  Get out and live with nature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with you absolutely,&quot; said I, with emphasis.</p>
<p>For one moment I had relaxed my vigilance, and had spoken my true  sentiments.  North looked at me long and curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Then why, in the name of Pan and Apollo,&quot; he asked, &quot;have you been  singing this deceitful paean to summer in town?&quot;</p>
<p>I suppose I looked my guilt.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha,&quot; said North, &quot;I see.  May I ask her name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Annie Ashton,&quot; said I, simply.  &quot;She played Nannette in Binkley &amp;  Bing&#x27;s production of The Silver Cord.  She is to have a better part  next season.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take me to see her,&quot; said North.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton lived with her mother in a small hotel.  They were out of  the West, and had a little money that bridged the seasons.  As press- agent of Binkley &amp; Bing I had tried to keep her before the public.  As  Robert James Vandiver I had hoped to withdraw her; for if ever one was  made to keep company with said Vandiver and smell the salt breeze on  the south shore of Long Island and listen to the ducks quack in the  watches of the night, it was the Ashton set forth above.</p>
<p>But she had a soul above ducks--above nightingales; aye, even above  birds of paradise.  She was very beautiful, with quiet ways, and  seemed genuine.  She had both taste and talent for the stage, and she  liked to stay at home and read and make caps for her mother.  She was  unvaryingly kind and friendly with Binkley &amp; Bing&#x27;s press-agent.   Since the theatre had closed she had allowed Mr.  Vandiver to call in  an unofficial role.  I had often spoken to her of my friend, Spencer  Grenville North; and so, as it was early, the first turn of the  vaudeville being not yet over, we left to find a telephone.</p>
<p>Miss Ashton would be very glad to see Mr.  Vandiver and Mr.  North.</p>
<p>We found her fitting a new cap on her mother.  I never saw her look  more charming.</p>
<p>North made himself disagreeably entertaining.  He was a good talker,  and had a way with him.  Besides, he had two, ten, or thirty millions,  I&#x27;ve for gotten which.  I incautiously admired the mother&#x27;s cap,  whereupon she brought out her store of a dozen or two, and I took a  course in edgings and frills.  Even though Annie&#x27;s fingers had pinked,  or ruched, or hemmed, or whatever you do to &#x27;em, they palled upon me.   And I could hear North drivelling to Annie about his odious Adirondack  camp.</p>
<p>Two days after that I saw North in his motor-car with Miss Ashton and  her mother.  On the next afternoon he dropped in on me.</p>
<p>&quot;Bobby,&quot; said he, &quot;this old burg isn&#x27;t such a bad proposition in the  summer-time, after all.  Since I&#x27;ve keen knocking around it looks  better to me.  There are some first-rate musical comedies and light  operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens.  And if you hunt up  the right places and stick to soft drinks, you can keep about as cool  here as you can in the country.  Hang it! when you come to think of  it, there&#x27;s nothing much to the country, anyhow.  You get tired and  sunburned and lonesome, and you have to eat any old thing that the  cook dishes up to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It makes a difference, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; said I.</p>
<p>&quot;It certainly does.  Now, I found some whitebait yesterday, at  Maurice&#x27;s, with a new sauce that beats anything in the trout line I  ever tasted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It makes a difference, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;Immense.  The sauce is the main thing with whitebait.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It makes a difference, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; I asked, looking him straight in  the eye.  He understood.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Bob,&quot; he said, &quot;I was going to tell you.  I couldn&#x27;t help  it.  I&#x27;ll play fair with you, but I&#x27;m going in to win.  She is the  &#x27;one particular&#x27; for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said I.  &quot;It&#x27;s a fair field.  There are no rights for you  to encroach upon.&quot;</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon Miss Ashton invited North and myself to have tea  in her apartment.  He was devoted, and she was more charming than  usual.  By avoiding the subject of caps I managed to get a word or two  into and out of the talk.  Miss Ashton asked me in a make- conversational tone something about the next season&#x27;s tour.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said I, &quot;I don&#x27;t know about that.  I&#x27;m not going to be with  Binkley &amp; Bing next season.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I thought,&quot; said she, &quot;that they were going to put the Number  One road company under your charge.  I thought you told me so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were,&quot; said I, &quot;but they won&#x27;t..  I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;m going  to do.  I&#x27;m going to the south shore of Long Island and buy a small  cottage I know there on the edge of the bay.  And I&#x27;ll buy a catboat  and a rowboat and a shotgun and a yellow dog.  I&#x27;ve got money enough  to do it.  And I&#x27;ll smell the salt wind all day when it blows from the  sea and the pine odor when it blows from the land.  And, of course,  I&#x27;ll write plays until I have a trunk full of &#x27;em on hand.</p>
<p>&quot;And the next thing and the biggest thing I&#x27;ll do will be to buy that  duck-farm next door.  Few people understand ducks.  I can watch &#x27;em  for hours.  They can march better than any company in the National  Guard, and they can play &#x27;follow my leader&#x27; better than the entire  Democratic party.  Their voices don&#x27;t amount to much, but I like to  hear &#x27;em.  They wake you up a dozen times a night, but there&#x27;s a  homely sound about their quacking that is more musical to me than the  cry of &#x27;Fresh strawber-rees!&#x27; under your window in the morning when  you want to sleep.</p>
<p>&quot;And,&quot; I went on, enthusiastically, &quot;do you know the value of ducks  besides their beauty and intelligence and order and sweetness of  voice?  Picking their feathers gives you an unfailing and never  ceasing income.  On a farm that I know the feathers were sold for $400  in one year.  Think of that!  And the ones shipped to the market will  bring in more money than that.  Yes, I am for the ducks and the salt  breeze coming over the bay.  I think I shall get a Chinaman cook, and  with him and the dog and the sunsets for company I shall do well.  No  more of this dull, baking, senseless, roaring city for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Miss Ashton looked surprised.  North laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to begin one of my plays tonight,&quot; I said, &quot;so I must be  going.&quot;  And with that I took my departure.</p>
<p>A few days later Miss Ashton telephoned to me, asking me to call at  four in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>&quot;You have been very good to me,&quot; she said, hesitatingly, &quot;and I  thought I would tell you.  I am going to leave the stage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said I, &quot;I suppose you will.  They usually do when there&#x27;s so  much money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no money,&quot; she said, &quot;or very little.  Our money is almost  gone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I am told,&quot; said I, &quot;that he has something like two or ten or  thirty millions--I have forgotten which.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; she said.  &quot;I will not pretend that I do not.   I am not going to marry Mr.  North.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why are you leaving the stage ?&quot; I asked, severely.  &quot;What else  can you do to earn a living?&quot;</p>
<p>She came closer to me, and I can see the look in her eyes yet as she  spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;I can pick ducks,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>We sold the first year&#x27;s feathers for $350.</p>
<p>A POOR RULE</p>
<p>I have always maintained, and asserted ime to time, that woman is no  mystery; that man can foretell, construe, subdue, comprehend, and  interpret her.  That she is a mystery has been foisted by herself upon  credulous mankind.  Whether I am right or wrong we shall see.  As  &quot;Harper&#x27;s Drawer&quot; used to say in bygone years: &quot;The following good  story is told of Miss --, Mr. --, Mr. --and Mr. --.&quot;</p>
<p>We shall have to omit &quot;Bishop X&quot; and &quot;the Rev. --,&quot; for they do not  belong.</p>
<p>In those days Paloma was a new town on the line of the Southern  Pacific.  A reporter would have called it a &quot;mushroom&quot; town; but it  was not.  Paloma was, first and last, of the toadstool variety.</p>
<p>The train stopped there at noon for the engine to drink and for the  passengers both to drink and to dine.  There was a new yellow-pine  hotel, also a wool warehouse, and perhaps three dozen box residences.   The rest was composed of tents, cow ponies, &quot;black-waxy&quot; mud, and  mesquite-trees, all bound round by a horizon.  Paloma was an about-to- be city.  The houses represented faith; the tents hope; the twice-a- day train by which you might leave, creditably sustained the role of  charity.</p>
<p>The Parisian Restaurant occupied the muddiest spot in the town while  it rained, and the warmest when it shone.  It was operated, owned, and  perpetrated by a citizen known as Old Man Hinkle, who had come out of  Indiana to make his fortune in this land of condensed milk and  sorghum.</p>
<p>There was a four-room, unpainted, weather-boarded box house in which  the family lived.  From the kitchen extended a &quot;shelter&quot; made of poles  covered with chaparral brush.  Under this was a table and two benches,  each twenty feet long, the product of Paloma home carpentry.  Here was  set forth the roast mutton, the stewed apples, boiled beans, soda- biscuits, puddinorpie, and hot coffee of the Parisian menu.</p>
<p>Ma Hinkle and a subordinate known to the ears as &quot;Betty,&quot; but denied  to the eyesight, presided at the range.  Pa Hinkle himself, with  salamandrous thumbs, served the scalding viands.  During rush hours a  Mexican youth, who rolled and smoked cigarettes between courses, aided  him in waiting on the guests.  As is customary at Parisian banquets, I  place the sweets at the end of my wordy menu.</p>
<p>Ileen Hinkle!</p>
<p>The spelling is correct, for I have seen her write it.  No doubt she  had been named by ear; but she so splendidly bore the orthography that  Tom Moore himself (had he seen her) would have indorsed the  phonography.</p>
<p>Ileen was the daughter of the house, and the first Lady Cashier to  invade the territory south of an east-and-west line drawn through  Galveston and Del Rio.  She sat on a high stool in a rough pine grand- stand--or was it a temple?--under the shelter at the door of the  kitchen.  There was a barbed-wire protection in front of her, with a  little arch under which you passed your money.  Heaven knows why the  barbed wire; for every man who dined Parisianly there would have died  in her service.  Her duties were light; each meal was a dollar; you  put it under the arch, and she took it.</p>
<p>I set out with the intent to describe Ileen Hinkle to you.  Instead, I  must refer you to the volume by Edmund Burke entitled: A Philosophical  Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful.  It  is an exhaustive treatise, dealing first with the primitive  conceptions of beauty--roundness and smoothness, I think they are,  according to Burke.  It is well said.  Rotundity is a patent charm; as  for smoothness--the more new wrinkles a woman acquires, the smoother  she becomes.</p>
<p>Ileen was a strictly vegetable compound, guaranteed under the Pure  Ambrosia and Balm-of-Gilead Act of the year of the fall of Adam.  She  was a fruit-stand blonde-strawberries, peaches, cherries, etc.  Her  eyes were wide apart, and she possessed the calm that precedes a storm  that never comes.  But it seems to me that words (at any rate per) are  wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful.  Like fancy, &quot;It is  engendered in the eyes.&quot;  There are three kinds of beauties--I was  foreordained to be homiletic; I can never stick to a story.</p>
<p>The first is the freckle-faced, snub-nosed girl whom you like.  The  second is Maud Adams.  The third is, or are, the ladies in  Bouguereau&#x27;s paintings.  Ileen Hinkle was the fourth.  She was the  mayoress of Spotless Town.  There were a thousand golden apples coming  to her as Helen of the Troy laundries.</p>
<p>The Parisian Restaurant was within a radius.  Even from beyond its  circumference men rode in to Paloma to win her smiles.  They got them.   One meal--one smile--one dollar.  But, with all her impartiality,  Ileen seemed to favor three of her admirers above the rest.  According  to the rules of politeness, I will mention myself last.</p>
<p>The first was an artificial product known as Bryan Jacks--a name that  had obviously met with reverses.  Jacks was the outcome of paved  cities.  He was a small man made of some material resembling flexible  sandstone.  His hair was the color of a brick Quaker meeting-house;  his eyes were twin cranberries; his mouth was like the aperture under  a drop-letters-here sign.</p>
<p>He knew every city from Bangor to San Francisco, thence north to  Portland, thence S. 45 E. to a given point in Florida.  He had  mastered every art, trade, game, business, profession, and sport in  the world, had been present at, or hurrying on his way to, every head- line event that had ever occurred between oceans since he was five  years old.  You might open the atlas, place your finger at random upon  the name of a town, and Jacks would tell you the front names of three  prominent citizens before you could close it again.  He spoke  patronizingly and even disrespectfully of Broadway, Beacon Hill,  Michigan, Euclid, and Fifth avenues, and the St. Louis Four Courts.   Compared with him as a cosmopolite, the Wandering Jew would have  seemed a mere hermit.  He had learned everything the world could teach  him, and he would tell you about it.</p>
<p>I hate to be reminded of Pollock&#x27;s Course of Time, and so do you; but  every time I saw Jacks I would think of the poet&#x27;s description of  another poet by the name of G. G. Byron who &quot;Drank early; deeply  drank--drank draughts that common millions might have quenched; then  died of thirst because there was no more to drink.&quot;</p>
<p>That fitted Jacks, except that, instead of dying, he came to Paloma,  which was about the same thing.  He was a telegrapher and station- and  express-agent at seventy-five dollars a month.  Why a young man who  knew everything and could do everything was content to serve in such  an obscure capacity I never could understand, although he let out a  hint once that it was as a personal favor to the president and  stockholders of the S. P. Ry. Co.</p>
<p>One more line of description, and I turn Jacks over to you.  He wore  bright blue clothes, yellow shoes, and a bow tie made of the same  cloth as his shirt.</p>
<p>My rival No.2 was Bud Cunningham, whose services had been engaged by a  ranch near Paloma to assist in compelling refractory cattle to keep  within the bounds of decorum and order.  Bud was the only cowboy off  the stage that I ever saw who looked like one on it.  He wore the  sombrero, the chaps, and the handkerchief tied at the back of his  neck.</p>
<p>Twice a week Bud rode in from the Val Verde Ranch to sup at the  Parisian Restaurant.  He rode a many-high-handed Kentucky horse at a  tremendously fast lope, which animal he would rein up so suddenly  under the big mesquite at the corner of the brush shelter that his  hoofs would plough canals yards long in the loam.</p>
<p>Jacks and I were regular boarders at the restaurant, of course.</p>
<p>The front room of the Hinkle House was as neat a little parlor as  there was in the black-waxy country.  It was all willow rocking- chairs, and home-knit tidies, and albums, and conch shells in a row.   And a little upright piano in one comer.</p>
<p>Here Jacks and Bud and I--or sometimes one or two of us, according to  our good-luck--used to sit of evenings when the tide of trade was  over, and &quot;visit&quot; Miss Hinkle.</p>
<p>Ileen was a girl of ideas.  She was destined for higher things (if  there can be anything higher) than taking in dollars all day through a  barbed-wire wicket.  She had read and listened and thought.  Her looks  would have formed a career for a less ambitious girl; but, rising  superior to mere beauty, she must establish something in the nature of  a salon--the only one in Paloma.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you think that Shakespeare was a great writer?&quot; she would ask,  with such a pretty little knit of her arched brows that the late  Ignatius Donnelly, himself, had he seen it, could scarcely have saved  his Bacon.</p>
<p>Ileen was of the opinion, also, that Boston is more cultured than  Chicago; that Rosa Bonheur was one of the greatest of women painters;  that Westerners are more spontaneous and open-hearted than Easterners;  that London must be a very foggy city, and that California must be  quite lovely in the springtime.  And of many other opinions indicating  a keeping up with the world&#x27;s best thought.</p>
<p>These, however, were but gleaned from hearsay and evidence: Ileen had  theories of her own.  One, in particular, she disseminated to us  untiringly.  Flattery she detested.  Frankness and honesty of speech  and action, she declared, were the chief mental ornaments of man and  woman.  If ever she could like any one, it would be for those  qualities.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m awfully weary,&quot; she said, one evening, when we three musketeers  of the mesquite were in the little parlor, &quot;of having compliments on  my looks paid to me.  I know I&#x27;m not beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>(Bud Cunningham told me afterward that it was all he could do to keep  from calling her a liar when she said that.)</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m only a little Middle-Western girl,&quot; went on Ileen, &quot;who justs  wants to be simple and neat, and tries to help her father make a  humble living.&quot;</p>
<p>(Old Man Hinkle was shipping a thousand silver dollars a month, clear  profit, to a bank in San Antonio.[)]</p>
<p>Bud twisted around in his chair and bent the rim of his hat, from  which he could never be persuaded to separate.  He did not know  whether she wanted what she said she wanted or what she knew she  deserved.  Many a wiser man has hesitated at deciding.  Bud decided.</p>
<p>&quot;Why--ah, Miss Ileen, beauty, as you might say, ain&#x27;t everything.  Not  sayin&#x27; that you haven&#x27;t your share of good looks, I always admired  more than anything else about you the nice, kind way you treat your ma  and pa.  Any one what&#x27;s good to their parents and is a kind of home- body don&#x27;t specially need to be too pretty.&quot;</p>
<p>Ileen gave him one of her sweetest smiles.  &quot;Thank you, Mr.   Cunningham,&quot; she said.  &quot;I consider that one of the finest compliments  I&#x27;ve had in a long time.  I&#x27;d so much rather hear you say that than to  hear you talk about my eyes and hair.  I&#x27;m glad you believe me when I  say I don&#x27;t like flattery.&quot;</p>
<p>Our cue was there for us.  Bud had made a good guess.  You couldn&#x27;t  lose Jacks.  He chimed in next.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing, Miss Ileen,&quot; he said; &quot;the good-lookers don&#x27;t always win  out.  Now, you ain&#x27;t bad looking, of course-but that&#x27;s nix-cum-rous.   I knew a girl once in Dubuque with a face like a cocoanut, who could  skin the cat twice on a horizontal bar without changing hands.  Now, a  girl might have the California peach crop mashed to a marmalade and  not be able to do that.  I&#x27;ve seen--er--worse lookers than you, Miss  Ileen; but what I like about you is the business way you&#x27;ve got of  doing things.  Cool and wise--that&#x27;s the winning way for a girl.  Mr.  Hinkle told me the other day you&#x27;d never taken in a lead silver dollar  or a plugged one since you&#x27;ve been on the job.  Now, that&#x27;s the stuff  for a girl--that&#x27;s what catches me.&quot;</p>
<p>Jacks got his smile, too.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Jacks,&quot; said Ileen.  &quot;If you only knew how I  appreciate any one&#x27;s being candid and not a flatterer!  I get so tired  of people telling me I&#x27;m pretty.  I think it is the loveliest thing to  have friends who tell you the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>Then I thought I saw an expectant look on Ileen&#x27;s face as she glanced  toward me.  I had a wild, sudden impulse to dare fate, and tell her of  all the beautiful handiwork of the Great Artificer she was the most  exquisite--that she was a flawless pearl gleaming pure and serene in a  setting of black mud and emerald prairies--that she was--a--a corker;  and as for mine, I cared not if she were as crtiel as a serpent&#x27;s  tooth to her fond parents, or if she couldn&#x27;t tell a plugged dollar  from a bridle buckle, if I might sing, chant, praise, glorify, and  worship her peerless and wonderful beauty.</p>
<p>But I refrained.  I feared the fate of a flatterer.  I had witnessed  her delight at the crafty and discreet words of Bud and Jacks.  No!   Miss Hinkle was not one to be beguiled by the plated-silver tongue of  a flatterer.  So I joined the ranks of the candid and honest.  At once  I became mendacious and didactic.</p>
<p>&quot;In all ages, Miss Hinkle,&quot; said I, &quot;in spite of the poetry and  romance of each, intellect in woman has been admired more than beauty.   Even in Cleopatra, herself, men found more charm in her queenly mind  than in her looks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I should think so!&quot; said Ileen.  &quot;I&#x27;ve seen pictures of her  that weren&#x27;t so much.  she had an awfully long nose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I may say so,&quot; I went on, &quot;you remind me of Cleopatra, Miss  Ileen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my nose isn&#x27;t so long!&quot; said she, opening her eyes wide and  touching that comely feature with a dimpled forefinger.</p>
<p>&quot;Why--er--I mean,&quot; said I--&quot; I mean as to mental endowments.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said she; and then I got my smile just as Bud and Jacks had got  theirs.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank every one of you,&quot; she said, very, very sweetly, &quot;for being so  frank and honest with me.  That&#x27;s the way I want you to be always.   Just tell me plainly and truthfully what you think, and we&#x27;ll all be  the best friends in the world.  And now, because you&#x27;ve been so good  to me, and understand so well how I dislike people who do nothing but  pay me exaggerated compliments, I&#x27;ll sing and play a little for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, we expressed our thanks and joy; but we would have been  better pleased if Ileen had remained in her low rocking-chair face to  face with us and let us gaze upon her.  For she was no Adelina Patti-- not even on the fare-wellest of the diva&#x27;s farewell tours.  She had a  cooing little voice like that of a turtle-dove that could almost fill  the parlor when the windows and doors were closed, and Betty was not  rattling the lids of the stove in the kitchen.  She had a gamut that I  estimate at about eight inches on the piano; and her runs and trills  sounded like the clothes bubbling in your grandmother&#x27;s iron wash-pot.   Believe that she must have been beautiful when I tell you that it  sounded like music to us.</p>
<p>&quot;She Must Have Been Beautiful When I Tell You That It Sounded Like  Music To Us&quot;</p>
<p>Ileen&#x27;s musical taste was catholic.  She would sing through a pile of  sheet music on the left-hand top of the piano, laying each slaughtered  composition on the right-hand top.  The next evening she would sing  from right to left.  Her favorites were Mendelssohn, and Moody and  Sankey.  By request she always wound up with Sweet Violets and When  the Leaves Begin to Turn.</p>
<p>When we left at ten o&#x27;clock the three of us would go down to Jacks&#x27;  little wooden station and sit on the platform, swinging our feet and  trying to pump one another for dews as to which way Miss Ileen&#x27;s  inclinations seemed to lean.  That is the way of rivals--they do not  avoid and glower at one another; they convene and converse and  construe--striving by the art politic to estimate the strength of the  enemy.</p>
<p>One day there came a dark horse to Paloma, a young lawyer who at once  flaunted his shingle and himself spectacularly upon the town.  His  name was C. Vincent Vesey.  You could see at a glance that he was a  recent graduate of a southwestern law school.  His Prince Albert coat,  light striped trousers, broad-brimmed soft black hat, and narrow white  muslin bow tie proclaimed that more loudly than any diploma could.   Vesey was a compound of Daniel Webster, Lord Chesterfield, Beau  Brummell, and Little Jack Horner.  His coming boomed Paloma.  The next  day after he arrived an addition to the town was surveyed and laid off  in lots.</p>
<p>Of course, Vesey, to further his professional fortunes, must mingle  with the citizenry and outliers of Paloma.  And, as well as with the  soldier men, he was bound to seek popularity with the gay dogs of the  place.  So Jacks and Bud Cunningham and I came to be honored by his  acquaintance.</p>
<p>The doctrine of predestination would have been discredited had not  Vesey seen Ileen Hinkle and become fourth in the tourney.   Magnificently, he boarded at the yellow pine hotel instead of at the  Parisian Restaurant; but he came to be a formidable visitor in the  Hinkle parlor.  His competition reduced Bud to an inspired increase of  profanity, drove Jacks to an outburst of slang so weird that it  sounded more horrible than the most trenchant of Bud&#x27;s imprecations,  and made me dumb with gloom.</p>
<p>For Vesey had the rhetoric.  Words flowed from him like oil from a  gusher.  Hyperbole, compliment, praise, appreciation, honeyed  gallantry, golden opinions, eulogy, and unveiled panegyric vied with  one another for pre-eminence in his speech.  We had small hopes that  Ileen could resist his oratory and Prince Albert.</p>
<p>But a day came that gave us courage.</p>
<p>About dusk one evening I was sitting on the little gallery in front of  the Hinkle parlor, waiting for Ileen to come, when I heard voices  inside.  She had come into the room with her father, and Old Man  Hinkle began to talk to her.  I had observed before that he was a  shrewd man, and not unphilosophic.</p>
<p>&quot;Ily,&quot; said he, &quot;I notice there&#x27;s three or four young fellers that  have been callin&#x27; to see you regular for quite a while.  Is there any  one of &#x27;em you like better than another?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, pa,&quot; she answered, &quot;I like all of &#x27;em very well.  I think Mr.  Cuninngham and Mr. Jacks and Mr. Harris are very nice young men.  They  are so frank and honest in everything they say to me.  I haven&#x27;t known  Mr. Vesey very long, but I think he&#x27;s a very nice young man, he&#x27;s so  frank and honest in everything he says to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m gittin&#x27; at,&quot; says old Hinkle.  &quot;You&#x27;ve always  been sayin&#x27; you like people what tell the truth and don&#x27;t go  humbuggin&#x27; you with compliments and bogus talk.  Now, suppose you make  a test of these fellers, and see which one of &#x27;em will talk the  straightest to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how&#x27;ll I do it, pa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you how.  You know you sing a little bit, Ily; you took  music-lessons nearly two years in Logansport.  It wasn&#x27;t long, but it  was all we could afford then.  And your teacher said you didn&#x27;t have  any voice, and it was a waste of money to keep on.  Now, suppose you  ask the fellers what they think of your singin&#x27;, and see what each one  of &#x27;em tells you.  The man that &#x27;ll tell you the truth about it &#x27;ll  have a mighty lot of nerve, and &#x27;ll do to tie to.  What do you think  of the plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, pa,&quot; said Ileen.  &quot;I think it&#x27;s a good idea.  I&#x27;ll try  it.&quot;</p>
<p>Ileen and Mr. Hinkle went out of the room through the inside doors.   Unobserved, I hurried down to the station.  Jacks was at his telegraph  table waiting for eight o&#x27;clock to come.  It was Bud&#x27;s night in town,  and when he rode in I repeated the conversation to them both.  I was  loyal to my rivals, as all true admirers of all Ileens should be.</p>
<p>Simultaneously the three of us were smitten by an uplifting thought.   Surely this test would eliminate Vesey from the contest.  He, with his  unctuous flattery, would be driven from the lists.  Well we remembered  Ileen&#x27;s love of frankness and honesty--how she treasured truth and  candor above vain compliment and blandishment.</p>
<p>Linking arms, we did a grotesque dance of joy up and down the  platform, singing Muldoon Was a Solid Man at the top of our voices.</p>
<p>That evening four of the willow rocking-chairs were filled besides the  lucky one that sustained the trim figure of Miss Hinkle.  Three of us  awaited with suppressed excitement the application of the test.  It  was tried on Bud first.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Cunningham,&quot; said Ileen, with her dazzling smile, after she had  sung When the Leaves Begin to Turn, &quot;what do you really think of my  voice?  Frankly and honestly, now, as you know I want you to always be  toward me.&quot;</p>
<p>Bud squirmed in his chair at his chance to show the sincerity that he  knew was required of him.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell you the truth, Miss Ileen,&quot; he said, earnestly, &quot;you ain&#x27;t got  much more voice than a weasel--just a little squeak, you know.  Of  course, we all like to hear you sing, for it&#x27;s kind of sweet and  soothin&#x27; after all, and you look most as mighty well sittin&#x27; on the  piano-stool as you do faced around.  But as for real singin&#x27;--I reckon  you couldn&#x27;t call it that.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked closely at Ileen to see if Bud had overdone his frankness,  but her pleased smile and sweetly spoken thanks assured me that we  were on the right track.</p>
<p>&quot;And what do you think, Mr. Jacks?&quot; she asked next. &quot;Take it from me,&quot; said Jacks, &quot;you ain&#x27;t in the prima donna class.   I&#x27;ve heard &#x27;em warble in every city in the United States; and I tell  you your vocal output don&#x27;t go.  Otherwise, you&#x27;ve got the grand opera  bunch sent to the soap factory--in looks, I mean; for the high  screechers generally look like Mary Ann on her Thursday out.  But nix  for the gargle work.  Your epiglottis ain&#x27;t a real side-stepper--its  footwork ain&#x27;t good.&quot;</p>
<p>With a merry laugh at Jacks&#x27; criticism, Ileen looked inquiringly at  me.</p>
<p>I admit that I faltered a little.  Was there not such a thing as being  too frank?  Perhaps I even hedged a little in my verdict; but I stayed  with the critics.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not skilled in scientific music, Miss Ileen,&quot; I said, &quot;but,  frankly, I cannot praise very highly the singing-voice that Nature has  given you.  It has long been a favorite comparison that a great singer  sings like a bird.  Well, there are birds and birds.  I would say that  your voice reminds me of the thrush&#x27;s--throaty and not strong, nor of  much compass or variety--but still--er--sweet--in--er--its--way, and-- er--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Mr.  Harris,&quot; interrupted Miss Hinkle.  &quot;I knew I could  depend Upon your frankness and honesty.&quot;</p>
<p>And then C. Vincent Vesey drew back one sleeve from his snowy cuff,  and the water came down at Lodore.</p>
<p>My memory cannot do justice to his masterly tribute to that priceless,  God-given treasure--Miss Hinkle&#x27;s voice.  He raved over it in terms  that, if they had been addressed to the morning stars when they sang  together, would have made that stellar choir explode in a meteoric  shower of flaming self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>He marshalled on his white finger-tips the grand opera stars of all  the continents, from Jenny Lind to Emma Abbott, only to depreciate  their endowments.  He spoke  of larynxes, of chest notes, of phrasing,  arpeggios, and other strange paraphernalia of the throaty art.  He  admitted, as though driven to a corner, that Jenny Lind had a note or  two in the high register that Miss Hinkle had not yet acquired--but-- &quot;!!!&quot;-that was a mere matter of practice and training.</p>
<p>And, as a peroration, he predicted--solemnly predicted--a career in  vocal art for the &quot;coming star of the Southwest--and one of which  grand old Texas may well be proud,&quot; hitherto unsurpassed in the annals  of musical history.</p>
<p>When we left at ten, Ileen gave each of us her usual warm, cordial  handshake, entrancing smile, and invitation to call again.  I could  not see that one was favored above or below another--but three of us  knew--we knew.</p>
<p>We knew that frankness and honesty had won, and that the rivals now  numbered three instead of four.</p>
<p>Down at the station Jacks brought out a pint bottle of the proper  stuff, and we celebrated the downfall of a blatant interloper.</p>
<p>Four days went by without anything happening worthy of recount.</p>
<p>On the fifth, Jacks and I, entering the brush arbor for our supper,  saw the Mexican youth, instead of a divinity in a spotless waist and a  navy-blue skirt, taking in the dollars through the barbed-wire wicket.</p>
<p>We rushed into the kitchen, meeting Pa Hinkle coming out with two cups  of hot coffee in his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Where&#x27;s Ileen?&quot; we asked, in recitative.</p>
<p>Pa Hinkle was a kindly man.  &quot;Well, gents,&quot; said he, &quot;it was a sudden  notion she took; but I&#x27;ve got the money, and I let her have her way.   She&#x27;s gone to a corn--a conservatory in Boston for four years for to  have her voice cultivated.  Now, excuse me to pass, gents, for this  coffee&#x27;s hot, and my thumbs is tender.&quot;</p>
<p>That night there were four instead of three of us sitting on the  station platform and swinging our feet.  C. Vincent Vesey was one of  us.  We discussed things while dogs barked at the moon that rose, as  big as a five-cent piece or a flour barrel, over the chaparral.</p>
<p>And what we discussed was whether it is better to lie to a woman or to  tell her the truth.</p>
<p>And as all of us were young then, we did not come to a decision.</p>
<p>THE END</p>
