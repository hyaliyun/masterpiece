Morals</p>
<p>by Robert Louis Stevenson</p>
<p>CHAPTER 1</p>
<p>THE problem of education is twofold: first to know, and then  to utter.  Every one who lives any semblance of an inner life  thinks more nobly and profoundly than he speaks; and the best  of teachers can impart only broken images of the truth which  they perceive.  Speech which goes from one to another between  two natures, and, what is worse, between two experiences, is  doubly relative.  The speaker buries his meaning; it is for  the hearer to dig it up again; and all speech, written or  spoken, is in a dead language until it finds a willing and  prepared hearer.  Such, moreover, is the complexity of life,  that when we condescend upon details in our advice, we may be  sure we condescend on error; and the best of education is to  throw out some magnanimous hints.  No man was ever so poor  that he could express all he has in him by words, looks, or  actions; his true knowledge is eternally incommunicable, for  it is a knowledge of himself; and his best wisdom comes to  him by no process of the mind, but in a supreme self- dictation, which keeps varying from hour to hour in its  dictates with the variation of events and circumstances.</p>
<p>A few men of picked nature, full of faith, courage, and  contempt for others, try earnestly to set forth as much as  they can grasp of this inner law; but the vast majority, when  they come to advise the young, must be content to retail  certain doctrines which have been already retailed to them in  their own youth.  Every generation has to educate another  which it has brought upon the stage.  People who readily  accept the responsibility of parentship, having very  different matters in their eye, are apt to feel rueful when  that responsibility falls due.  What are they to tell the  child about life and conduct, subjects on which they have  themselves so few and such confused opinions?  Indeed, I do  not know; the least said, perhaps, the soonest mended; and  yet the child keeps asking, and the parent must find some  words to say in his own defence.  Where does he find them?  and what are they when found?</p>
<p>As a matter of experience, and in nine hundred and ninety- nine cases out of a thousand, he will instil into his wide- eyed brat three bad things: the terror of public opinion,  and, flowing from that as a fountain, the desire of wealth  and applause.  Besides these, or what might be deduced as  corollaries from these, he will teach not much else of any  effective value: some dim notions of divinity, perhaps, and  book-keeping, and how to walk through a quadrille.</p>
<p>But, you may tell me, the young people are taught to be  Christians.  It may be want of penetration, but I have not  yet been able to perceive it.  As an honest man, whatever we  teach, and be it good or evil, it is not the doctrine of  Christ.  What he taught (and in this he is like all other  teachers worthy of the name) was not a code of rules, but a  ruling spirit; not truths, but a spirit of truth; not views,  but a view.  What he showed us was an attitude of mind.   Towards the many considerations on which conduct is built,  each man stands in a certain relation.  He takes life on a  certain principle.  He has a compass in his spirit which  points in a certain direction.  It is the attitude, the  relation, the point of the compass, that is the whole body  and gist of what he has to teach us; in this, the details are  comprehended; out of this the specific precepts issue, and by  this, and this only, can they be explained and applied.  And  thus, to learn aright from any teacher, we must first of all,  like a historical artist, think ourselves into sympathy with  his position and, in the technical phrase, create his  character.  A historian confronted with some ambiguous  politician, or an actor charged with a part, have but one  pre-occupation; they must search all round and upon every  side, and grope for some central conception which is to  explain and justify the most extreme details; until that is  found, the politician is an enigma, or perhaps a quack, and  the part a tissue of fustian sentiment and big words; but  once that is found, all enters into a plan, a human nature  appears, the politician or the stage-king is understood from  point to point, from end to end.  This is a degree of trouble  which will be gladly taken by a very humble artist; but not  even the terror of eternal fire can teach a business man to  bend his imagination to such athletic efforts.  Yet without  this, all is vain; until we understand the whole, we shall  understand none of the parts; and otherwise we have no more  than broken images and scattered words; the meaning remains  buried; and the language in which our prophet speaks to us is  a dead language in our ears.</p>
<p>Take a few of Christ&#x27;s sayings and compare them with our  current doctrines.</p>
<p>&#x27;Ye cannot,&#x27; he says, &#x27;SERVE GOD AND MAMMON.&#x27;  Cannot?  And  our whole system is to teach us how we can!</p>
<p>&#x27;THE CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD ARE WISER IN THEIR GENERATION  THAN THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT.&#x27;  Are they?  I had been led to  understand the reverse: that the Christian merchant, for  example, prospered exceedingly in his affairs; that honesty  was the best policy; that an author of repute had written a  conclusive treatise &#x27;How to make the best of both worlds.&#x27;   Of both worlds indeed!  Which am I to believe then - Christ  or the author of repute?</p>
<p>&#x27;TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR THE MORROW.&#x27;  Ask the Successful  Merchant; interrogate your own heart; and you will have to  admit that this is not only a silly but an immoral position.   All we believe, all we hope, all we honour in ourselves or  our contemporaries, stands condemned in this one sentence,  or, if you take the other view, condemns the sentence as  unwise and inhumane.  We are not then of the &#x27;same mind that  was in Christ.&#x27;  We disagree with Christ.  Either Christ  meant nothing, or else he or we must be in the wrong.  Well  says Thoreau, speaking of some texts from the New Testament,  and finding a strange echo of another style which the reader  may recognise: &#x27;Let but one of these sentences be rightly  read from any pulpit in the land, and there would not be left  one stone of that meeting-house upon another.&#x27;</p>
<p>It may be objected that these are what are called &#x27;hard  sayings&#x27;; and that a man, or an education, may be very  sufficiently Christian although it leave some of these  sayings upon one side.  But this is a very gross delusion.   Although truth is difficult to state, it is both easy and  agreeable to receive, and the mind runs out to meet it ere  the phrase be done.  The universe, in relation to what any  man can say of it, is plain, patent and staringly  comprehensible.  In itself, it is a great and travailing  ocean, unsounded, unvoyageable, an eternal mystery to man;  or, let us say, it is a monstrous and impassable mountain,  one side of which, and a few near slopes and foothills, we  can dimly study with these mortal eyes.  But what any man can  say of it, even in his highest utterance, must have relation  to this little and plain corner, which is no less visible to  us than to him.  We are looking on the same map; it will go  hard if we cannot follow the demonstration.  The longest and  most abstruse flight of a philosopher becomes clear and  shallow, in the flash of a moment, when we suddenly perceive  the aspect and drift of his intention.  The longest argument  is but a finger pointed; once we get our own finger rightly  parallel, and we see what the man meant, whether it be a new  star or an old street-lamp.  And briefly, if a saying is hard  to understand, it is because we are thinking of something  else.</p>
<p>But to be a true disciple is to think of the same things as  our prophet, and to think of different things in the same  order.  To be of the same mind with another is to see all  things in the same perspective; it is not to agree in a few  indifferent matters near at hand and not much debated; it is  to follow him in his farthest flights, to see the force of  his hyperboles, to stand so exactly in the centre of his  vision that whatever he may express, your eyes will light at  once on the original, that whatever he may see to declare,  your mind will at once accept.  You do not belong to the  school of any philosopher, because you agree with him that  theft is, on the whole, objectionable, or that the sun is  overhead at noon.  It is by the hard sayings that  discipleship is tested.  We are all agreed about the middling  and indifferent parts of knowledge and morality; even the  most soaring spirits too often take them tamely upon trust.   But the man, the philosopher or the moralist, does not stand  upon these chance adhesions; and the purpose of any system  looks towards those extreme points where it steps valiantly  beyond tradition and returns with some covert hint of things  outside.  Then only can you be certain that the words are not  words of course, nor mere echoes of the past; then only are  you sure that if he be indicating anything at all, it is a  star and not a street-lamp; then only do you touch the heart  of the mystery, since it was for these that the author wrote  his book.</p>
<p>Now, every now and then, and indeed surprisingly often,  Christ finds a word that transcends all common-place  morality; every now and then he quits the beaten track to  pioneer the unexpressed, and throws out a pregnant and  magnanimous hyperbole; for it is only by some bold poetry of  thought that men can be strung up above the level of everyday  conceptions to take a broader look upon experience or accept  some higher principle of conduct.  To a man who is of the  same mind that was in Christ, who stands at some centre not  too far from his, and looks at the world and conduct from  some not dissimilar or, at least, not opposing attitude - or,  shortly, to a man who is of Christ&#x27;s philosophy - every such  saying should come home with a thrill of joy and  corroboration; he should feel each one below his feet as  another sure foundation in the flux of time and chance; each  should be another proof that in the torrent of the years and  generations, where doctrines and great armaments and empires  are swept away and swallowed, he stands immovable, holding by  the eternal stars.  But alas! at this juncture of the ages it  is not so with us; on each and every such occasion our whole  fellowship of Christians falls back in disapproving wonder  and implicitly denies the saying.  Christians! the farce is  impudently broad.  Let us stand up in the sight of heaven and  confess.  The ethics that we hold are those of Benjamin  Franklin.  HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY, is perhaps a hard  saying; it is certainly one by which a wise man of these days  will not too curiously direct his steps; but I think it shows  a glimmer of meaning to even our most dimmed intelligences; I  think we perceive a principle behind it; I think, without  hyperbole, we are of the same mind that was in Benjamin  Franklin.</p>
<p>LAY MORALS CHAPTER II</p>
<p>BUT, I may be told, we teach the ten commandments, where a  world of morals lies condensed, the very pith and epitome of  all ethics and religion; and a young man with these precepts  engraved upon his mind must follow after profit with some  conscience and Christianity of method.  A man cannot go very  far astray who neither dishonours his parents, nor kills, nor  commits adultery, nor steals, nor bears false witness; for  these things, rightly thought out, cover a vast field of  duty.</p>
<p>Alas! what is a precept?  It is at best an illustration; it  is case law at the best which can be learned by precept.  The  letter is not only dead, but killing; the spirit which  underlies, and cannot be uttered, alone is true and helpful.   This is trite to sickness; but familiarity has a cunning  disenchantment; in a day or two she can steal all beauty from  the mountain tops; and the most startling words begin to fall  dead upon the ear after several repetitions.  If you see a  thing too often, you no longer see it; if you hear a thing  too often, you no longer hear it.  Our attention requires to  be surprised; and to carry a fort by assault, or to gain a  thoughtful hearing from the ruck of mankind, are feats of  about an equal difficulty and must be tried by not dissimilar  means.  The whole Bible has thus lost its message for the  common run of hearers; it has become mere words of course;  and the parson may bawl himself scarlet and beat the pulpit  like a thing possessed, but his hearers will continue to nod;  they are strangely at peace, they know all he has to say;  ring the old bell as you choose, it is still the old bell and  it cannot startle their composure.  And so with this byword  about the letter and the spirit.  It is quite true, no doubt;  but it has no meaning in the world to any man of us.  Alas!  it has just this meaning, and neither more nor less: that  while the spirit is true, the letter is eternally false.</p>
<p>The shadow of a great oak lies abroad upon the ground at  noon, perfect, clear, and stable like the earth.  But let a  man set himself to mark out the boundary with cords and pegs,  and were he never so nimble and never so exact, what with the  multiplicity of the leaves and the progression of the shadow  as it flees before the travelling sun, long ere he has made  the circuit the whole figure will have changed.  Life may be  compared, not to a single tree, but to a great and  complicated forest; circumstance is more swiftly changing  than a shadow, language much more inexact than the tools of a  surveyor; from day to day the trees fall and are renewed; the  very essences are fleeting as we look; and the whole world of  leaves is swinging tempest-tossed among the winds of time.   Look now for your shadows.  O man of formulae, is this a  place for you?  Have you fitted the spirit to a single case?   Alas, in the cycle of the ages when shall such another be  proposed for the judgment of man?  Now when the sun shines  and the winds blow, the wood is filled with an innumerable  multitude of shadows, tumultuously tossed and changing; and  at every gust the whole carpet leaps and becomes new.  Can  you or your heart say more?</p>
<p>Look back now, for a moment, on your own brief experience of  life; and although you lived it feelingly in your own person,  and had every step of conduct burned in by pains and joys  upon your memory, tell me what definite lesson does  experience hand on from youth to manhood, or from both to  age?  The settled tenor which first strikes the eye is but  the shadow of a delusion.  This is gone; that never truly  was; and you yourself are altered beyond recognition.  Times  and men and circumstances change about your changing  character, with a speed of which no earthly hurricane affords  an image.  What was the best yesterday, is it still the best  in this changed theatre of a tomorrow?  Will your own Past  truly guide you in your own violent and unexpected Future?   And if this be questionable, with what humble, with what  hopeless eyes, should we not watch other men driving beside  us on their unknown careers, seeing with unlike eyes,  impelled by different gales, doing and suffering in another  sphere of things?</p>
<p>And as the authentic clue to such a labyrinth and change of  scene, do you offer me these two score words? these five bald  prohibitions?  For the moral precepts are no more than five;  the first four deal rather with matters of observance than of  conduct; the tenth, THOU SHALT NOT COVET, stands upon another  basis, and shall be spoken of ere long.  The Jews, to whom  they were first given, in the course of years began to find  these precepts insufficient; and made an addition of no less  than six hundred and fifty others!  They hoped to make a  pocket-book of reference on morals, which should stand to  life in some such relation, say, as Hoyle stands in to the  scientific game of whist.  The comparison is just, and  condemns the design; for those who play by rule will never be  more than tolerable players; and you and I would like to play  our game in life to the noblest and the most divine  advantage.  Yet if the Jews took a petty and huckstering view  of conduct, what view do we take ourselves, who callously  leave youth to go forth into the enchanted forest, full of  spells and dire chimeras, with no guidance more complete than  is afforded by these five precepts?</p>
<p>HONOUR THY FATHER AND THY MOTHER.  Yes, but does that mean to  obey? and if so, how long and how far?  THOU SHALL NOT KILL.   Yet the very intention and purport of the prohibition may be  best fulfilled by killing.  THOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.   But some of the ugliest adulteries are committed in the bed  of marriage and under the sanction of religion and law.  THOU  SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS.  How? by speech or by silence  also? or even by a smile?  THOU SHALT NOT STEAL.  Ah, that  indeed!  But what is TO STEAL?</p>
<p>To steal?  It is another word to be construed; and who is to  be our guide?  The police will give us one construction,  leaving the word only that least minimum of meaning without  which society would fall in pieces; but surely we must take  some higher sense than this; surely we hope more than a bare  subsistence for mankind; surely we wish mankind to prosper  and go on from strength to strength, and ourselves to live  rightly in the eye of some more exacting potentate than a  policeman.  The approval or the disapproval of the police  must be eternally indifferent to a man who is both valorous  and good.  There is extreme discomfort, but no shame, in the  condemnation of the law.  The law represents that modicum of  morality which can be squeezed out of the ruck of mankind;  but what is that to me, who aim higher and seek to be my own  more stringent judge?  I observe with pleasure that no brave  man has ever given a rush for such considerations.  The  Japanese have a nobler and more sentimental feeling for this  social bond into which we all are born when we come into the  world, and whose comforts and protection we all indifferently  share throughout our lives:- but even to them, no more than  to our Western saints and heroes, does the law of the state  supersede the higher law of duty.  Without hesitation and  without remorse, they transgress the stiffest enactments  rather than abstain from doing right.  But the accidental  superior duty being thus fulfilled, they at once return in  allegiance to the common duty of all citizens; and hasten to  denounce themselves; and value at an equal rate their just  crime and their equally just submission to its punishment.</p>
<p>The evading of the police will not long satisfy an active  conscience or a thoughtful head.  But to show you how one or  the other may trouble a man, and what a vast extent of  frontier is left unridden by this invaluable eighth  commandment, let me tell you a few pages out of a young man&#x27;s  life.</p>
<p>He was a friend of mine; a young man like others; generous,  flighty, as variable as youth itself, but always with some  high motions and on the search for higher thoughts of life.   I should tell you at once that he thoroughly agrees with the  eighth commandment.  But he got hold of some unsettling  works, the New Testament among others, and this loosened his  views of life and led him into many perplexities.  As he was  the son of a man in a certain position, and well off, my  friend had enjoyed from the first the advantages of  education, nay, he had been kept alive through a sickly  childhood by constant watchfulness, comforts, and change of  air; for all of which he was indebted to his father&#x27;s wealth.</p>
<p>At college he met other lads more diligent than himself, who  followed the plough in summer-time to pay their college fees  in winter; and this inequality struck him with some force.   He was at that age of a conversible temper, and insatiably  curious in the aspects of life; and he spent much of his time  scraping acquaintance with all classes of man- and woman- kind.  In this way he came upon many depressed ambitions, and  many intelligences stunted for want of opportunity; and this  also struck him.  He began to perceive that life was a  handicap upon strange, wrong-sided principles; and not, as he  had been told, a fair and equal race.  He began to tremble  that he himself had been unjustly favoured, when he saw all  the avenues of wealth, and power, and comfort closed against  so many of his superiors and equals, and held unwearyingly  open before so idle, so desultory, and so dissolute a being  as himself.  There sat a youth beside him on the college  benches, who had only one shirt to his back, and, at  intervals sufficiently far apart, must stay at home to have  it washed.  It was my friend&#x27;s principle to stay away as  often as he dared; for I fear he was no friend to learning.   But there was something that came home to him sharply, in  this fellow who had to give over study till his shirt was  washed, and the scores of others who had never an opportunity  at all.  IF ONE OF THESE COULD TAKE HIS PLACE, he thought;  and the thought tore away a bandage from his eyes.  He was  eaten by the shame of his discoveries, and despised himself  as an unworthy favourite and a creature of the back-stairs of  Fortune.  He could no longer see without confusion one of  these brave young fellows battling up-hill against adversity.   Had he not filched that fellow&#x27;s birthright?  At best was he  not coldly profiting by the injustice of society, and  greedily devouring stolen goods?  The money, indeed, belonged  to his father, who had worked, and thought, and given up his  liberty to earn it; but by what justice could the money  belong to my friend, who had, as yet, done nothing but help  to squander it?  A more sturdy honesty, joined to a more even  and impartial temperament, would have drawn from these  considerations a new force of industry, that this equivocal  position might be brought as swiftly as possible to an end,  and some good services to mankind justify the appropriation  of expense.  It was not so with my friend, who was only  unsettled and discouraged, and filled full of that trumpeting  anger with which young men regard injustices in the first  blush of youth; although in a few years they will tamely  acquiesce in their existence, and knowingly profit by their  complications.  Yet all this while he suffered many indignant  pangs.  And once, when he put on his boots, like any other  unripe donkey, to run away from home, it was his best  consolation that he was now, at a single plunge, to free  himself from the responsibility of this wealth that was not  his, and do battle equally against his fellows in the warfare  of life.</p>
<p>Some time after this, falling into ill-health, he was sent at  great expense to a more favourable climate; and then I think  his perplexities were thickest.  When he thought of all the  other young men of singular promise, upright, good, the prop  of families, who must remain at home to die, and with all  their possibilities be lost to life and mankind; and how he,  by one more unmerited favour, was chosen out from all these  others to survive; he felt as if there were no life, no  labour, no devotion of soul and body, that could repay and  justify these partialities.  A religious lady, to whom he  communicated these reflections, could see no force in them  whatever.  &#x27;It was God&#x27;s will,&#x27; said she.  But he knew it was  by God&#x27;s will that Joan of Arc was burnt at Rouen, which  cleared neither Bedford nor Bishop Cauchon; and again, by  God&#x27;s will that Christ was crucified outside Jerusalem, which  excused neither the rancour of the priests nor the timidity  of Pilate.  He knew, moreover, that although the possibility  of this favour he was now enjoying issued from his  circumstances, its acceptance was the act of his own will;  and he had accepted it greedily, longing for rest and  sunshine.  And hence this allegation of God&#x27;s providence did  little to relieve his scruples.  I promise you he had a very  troubled mind.  And I would not laugh if I were you, though  while he was thus making mountains out of what you think  molehills, he were still (as perhaps he was) contentedly  practising many other things that to you seem black as hell.   Every man is his own judge and mountain-guide through life.   There is an old story of a mote and a beam, apparently not  true, but worthy perhaps of some consideration.  I should, if  I were you, give some consideration to these scruples of his,  and if I were he, I should do the like by yours; for it is  not unlikely that there may be something under both.  In the  meantime you must hear how my friend acted.  Like many  invalids, he supposed that he would die.  Now, should he die,  he saw no means of repaying this huge loan which, by the  hands of his father, mankind had advanced him for his  sickness.  In that case it would be lost money.  So he  determined that the advance should be as small as possible;  and, so long as he continued to doubt his recovery, lived in  an upper room, and grudged himself all but necessaries.  But  so soon as he began to perceive a change for the better, he  felt justified in spending more freely, to speed and brighten  his return to health, and trusted in the future to lend a  help to mankind, as mankind, out of its treasury, had lent a  help to him.</p>
<p>I do not say but that my friend was a little too curious and  partial in his view; nor thought too much of himself and too  little of his parents; but I do say that here are some  scruples which tormented my friend in his youth, and still,  perhaps, at odd times give him a prick in the midst of his  enjoyments, and which after all have some foundation in  justice, and point, in their confused way, to some more  honourable honesty within the reach of man.  And at least, is  not this an unusual gloss upon the eighth commandment?  And  what sort of comfort, guidance, or illumination did that  precept afford my friend throughout these contentions?  &#x27;Thou  shalt not steal.&#x27;  With all my heart!  But AM I stealing?</p>
<p>The truly quaint materialism of our view of life disables us  from pursuing any transaction to an end.  You can make no one  understand that his bargain is anything more than a bargain,  whereas in point of fact it is a link in the policy of  mankind, and either a good or an evil to the world.  We have  a sort of blindness which prevents us from seeing anything  but sovereigns.  If one man agrees to give another so many  shillings for so many hours&#x27; work, and then wilfully gives  him a certain proportion of the price in bad money and only  the remainder in good, we can see with half an eye that this  man is a thief.  But if the other spends a certain proportion  of the hours in smoking a pipe of tobacco, and a certain  other proportion in looking at the sky, or the clock, or  trying to recall an air, or in meditation on his own past  adventures, and only the remainder in downright work such as  he is paid to do, is he, because the theft is one of time and  not of money, - is he any the less a thief?  The one gave a  bad shilling, the other an imperfect hour; but both broke the  bargain, and each is a thief.  In piecework, which is what  most of us do, the case is none the less plain for being even  less material.  If you forge a bad knife, you have wasted  some of mankind&#x27;s iron, and then, with unrivalled cynicism,  you pocket some of mankind&#x27;s money for your trouble.  Is  there any man so blind who cannot see that this is theft?   Again, if you carelessly cultivate a farm, you have been  playing fast and loose with mankind&#x27;s resources against  hunger; there will be less bread in consequence, and for lack  of that bread somebody will die next winter: a grim  consideration.  And you must not hope to shuffle out of blame  because you got less money for your less quantity of bread;  for although a theft be partly punished, it is none the less  a theft for that.  You took the farm against competitors;  there were others ready to shoulder the responsibility and be  answerable for the tale of loaves; but it was you who took  it.  By the act you came under a tacit bargain with mankind  to cultivate that farm with your best endeavour; you were  under no superintendence, you were on parole; and you have  broke your bargain, and to all who look closely, and yourself  among the rest if you have moral eyesight, you are a thief.   Or take the case of men of letters.  Every piece of work  which is not as good as you can make it, which you have  palmed off imperfect, meagrely thought, niggardly in  execution, upon mankind who is your paymaster on parole and  in a sense your pupil, every hasty or slovenly or untrue  performance, should rise up against you in the court of your  own heart and condemn you for a thief.  Have you a salary?   If you trifle with your health, and so render yourself less  capable for duty, and still touch, and still greedily pocket  the emolument - what are you but a thief?  Have you double  accounts? do you by any time-honoured juggle, deceit, or  ambiguous process, gain more from those who deal with you  than it you were bargaining and dealing face to face in front  of God? - What are you but a thief?  Lastly, if you fill an  office, or produce an article, which, in your heart of  hearts, you think a delusion and a fraud upon mankind, and  still draw your salary and go through the sham manoeuvres of  this office, or still book your profits and keep on flooding  the world with these injurious goods? - though you were old,  and bald, and the first at church, and a baronet, what are  you but a thief?  These may seem hard words and mere  curiosities of the intellect, in an age when the spirit of  honesty is so sparingly cultivated that all business is  conducted upon lies and so-called customs of the trade, that  not a man bestows two thoughts on the utility or  honourableness of his pursuit.  I would say less if I thought  less.  But looking to my own reason and the right of things,  I can only avow that I am a thief myself, and that I  passionately suspect my neighbours of the same guilt.</p>
<p>Where did you hear that it was easy to be honest?  Do you  find that in your Bible?  Easy!  It is easy to be an ass and  follow the multitude like a blind, besotted bull in a  stampede; and that, I am well aware, is what you and Mrs.  Grundy mean by being honest.  But it will not bear the stress  of time nor the scrutiny of conscience.  Even before the  lowest of all tribunals, - before a court of law, whose  business it is, not to keep men right, or within a thousand  miles of right, but to withhold them from going so tragically  wrong that they will pull down the whole jointed fabric of  society by their misdeeds - even before a court of law, as we  begin to see in these last days, our easy view of following  at each other&#x27;s tails, alike to good and evil, is beginning  to be reproved and punished, and declared no honesty at all,  but open theft and swindling; and simpletons who have gone on  through life with a quiet conscience may learn suddenly, from  the lips of a judge, that the custom of the trade may be a  custom of the devil.  You thought it was easy to be honest.   Did you think it was easy to be just and kind and truthful?   Did you think the whole duty of aspiring man was as simple as  a horn-pipe? and you could walk through life like a gentleman  and a hero, with no more concern than it takes to go to  church or to address a circular?  And yet all this time you  had the eighth commandment! and, what makes it richer, you  would not have broken it for the world!</p>
<p>The truth is, that these commandments by themselves are of  little use in private judgment.  If compression is what you  want, you have their whole spirit compressed into the golden  rule; and yet there expressed with more significance, since  the law is there spiritually and not materially stated.  And  in truth, four out of these ten commands, from the sixth to  the ninth, are rather legal than ethical.  The police-court  is their proper home.  A magistrate cannot tell whether you  love your neighbour as yourself, but he can tell more or less  whether you have murdered, or stolen, or committed adultery,  or held up your hand and testified to that which was not; and  these things, for rough practical tests, are as good as can  be found.  And perhaps, therefore, the best condensation of  the Jewish moral law is in the maxims of the priests,  &#x27;neminem laedere&#x27; and &#x27;suum cuique tribuere.&#x27;  But all this  granted, it becomes only the more plain that they are  inadequate in the sphere of personal morality; that while  they tell the magistrate roughly when to punish, they can  never direct an anxious sinner what to do.</p>
<p>Only Polonius, or the like solemn sort of ass, can offer us a  succinct proverb by way of advice, and not burst out blushing  in our faces.  We grant them one and all and for all that  they are worth; it is something above and beyond that we  desire.  Christ was in general a great enemy to such a way of  teaching; we rarely find him meddling with any of these plump  commands but it was to open them out, and lift his hearers  from the letter to the spirit.  For morals are a personal  affair; in the war of righteousness every man fights for his  own hand; all the six hundred precepts of the Mishna cannot  shake my private judgment; my magistracy of myself is an  indefeasible charge, and my decisions absolute for the time  and case.  The moralist is not a judge of appeal, but an  advocate who pleads at my tribunal.  He has to show not the  law, but that the law applies.  Can he convince me? then he  gains the cause.  And thus you find Christ giving various  counsels to varying people, and often jealously careful to  avoid definite precept.  Is he asked, for example, to divide  a heritage?  He refuses: and the best advice that he will  offer is but a paraphrase of that tenth commandment which  figures so strangely among the rest.  TAKE HEED, AND BEWARE  OF COVETOUSNESS.  If you complain that this is vague, I have  failed to carry you along with me in my argument.  For no  definite precept can be more than an illustration, though its  truth were resplendent like the sun, and it was announced  from heaven by the voice of God.  And life is so intricate  and changing, that perhaps not twenty times, or perhaps not  twice in the ages, shall we find that nice consent of  circumstances to which alone it can apply.</p>
<p>LAY MORALS CHAPTER III</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH the world and life have in a sense become  commonplace to our experience, it is but in an external  torpor; the true sentiment slumbers within us; and we have  but to reflect on ourselves or our surroundings to rekindle  our astonishment.  No length of habit can blunt our first  surprise.  Of the world I have but little to say in this  connection; a few strokes shall suffice.  We inhabit a dead  ember swimming wide in the blank of space, dizzily spinning  as it swims, and lighted up from several million miles away  by a more horrible hell-fire than was ever conceived by the  theological imagination.  Yet the dead ember is a green,  commodious dwelling-place; and the reverberation of this  hell-fire ripens flower and fruit and mildly warms us on  summer eves upon the lawn.  Far off on all hands other dead  embers, other flaming suns, wheel and race in the apparent  void; the nearest is out of call, the farthest so far that  the heart sickens in the effort to conceive the distance.   Shipwrecked seamen on the deep, though they bestride but the  truncheon of a boom, are safe and near at home compared with  mankind on its bullet.  Even to us who have known no other,  it seems a strange, if not an appalling, place of residence.</p>
<p>But far stranger is the resident, man, a creature compact of  wonders that, after centuries of custom, is still wonderful  to himself.  He inhabits a body which he is continually  outliving, discarding and renewing.  Food and sleep, by an  unknown alchemy, restore his spirits and the freshness of his  countenance.  Hair grows on him like grass; his eyes, his  brain, his sinews, thirst for action; he joys to see and  touch and hear, to partake the sun and wind, to sit down and  intently ponder on his astonishing attributes and situation,  to rise up and run, to perform the strange and revolting  round of physical functions.  The sight of a flower, the note  of a bird, will often move him deeply; yet he looks  unconcerned on the impassable distances and portentous  bonfires of the universe.  He comprehends, he designs, he  tames nature, rides the sea, ploughs, climbs the air in a  balloon, makes vast inquiries, begins interminable labours,  joins himself into federations and populous cities, spends  his days to deliver the ends of the earth or to benefit  unborn posterity; and yet knows himself for a piece of  unsurpassed fragility and the creature of a few days.  His  sight, which conducts him, which takes notice of the farthest  stars, which is miraculous in every way and a thing defying  explanation or belief, is yet lodged in a piece of jelly, and  can be extinguished with a touch.  His heart, which all  through life so indomitably, so athletically labours, is but  a capsule, and may be stopped with a pin.  His whole body,  for all its savage energies, its leaping and its winged  desires, may yet be tamed and conquered by a draught of air  or a sprinkling of cold dew.  What he calls death, which is  the seeming arrest of everything, and the ruin and hateful  transformation of the visible body, lies in wait for him  outwardly in a thousand accidents, and grows up in secret  diseases from within.  He is still learning to be a man when  his faculties are already beginning to decline; he has not  yet understood himself or his position before he inevitably  dies.  And yet this mad, chimerical creature can take no  thought of his last end, lives as though he were eternal,  plunges with his vulnerable body into the shock of war, and  daily affronts death with unconcern.  He cannot take a step  without pain or pleasure.  His life is a tissue of  sensations, which he distinguishes as they seem to come more  directly from himself or his surroundings.  He is conscious  of himself as a joyer or a sufferer, as that which craves,  chooses, and is satisfied; conscious of his surroundings as  it were of an inexhaustible purveyor, the source of aspects,  inspirations, wonders, cruel knocks and transporting  caresses.  Thus he goes on his way, stumbling among delights  and agonies.</p>
<p>Matter is a far-fetched theory, and materialism is without a  root in man.  To him everything is important in the degree to  which it moves him.  The telegraph wires and posts, the  electricity speeding from clerk to clerk, the clerks, the  glad or sorrowful import of the message, and the paper on  which it is finally brought to him at home, are all equally  facts, all equally exist for man.  A word or a thought can  wound him as acutely as a knife of steel.  If he thinks he is  loved, he will rise up and glory to himself, although he be  in a distant land and short of necessary bread.  Does he  think he is not loved? - he may have the woman at his beck,  and there is not a joy for him in all the world.  Indeed, if  we are to make any account of this figment of reason, the  distinction between material and immaterial, we shall  conclude that the life of each man as an individual is  immaterial, although the continuation and prospects of  mankind as a race turn upon material conditions.  The  physical business of each man&#x27;s body is transacted for him;  like a sybarite, he has attentive valets in his own viscera;  he breathes, he sweats, he digests without an effort, or so  much as a consenting volition; for the most part he even  eats, not with a wakeful consciousness, but as it were  between two thoughts.  His life is centred among other and  more important considerations; touch him in his honour or his  love, creatures of the imagination which attach him to  mankind or to an individual man or woman; cross him in his  piety which connects his soul with heaven; and he turns from  his food, he loathes his breath, and with a magnanimous  emotion cuts the knots of his existence and frees himself at  a blow from the web of pains and pleasures.</p>
<p>It follows that man is twofold at least; that he is not a  rounded and autonomous empire; but that in the same body with  him there dwell other powers tributary but independent.  If I  now behold one walking in a garden, curiously coloured and  illuminated by the sun, digesting his food with elaborate  chemistry, breathing, circulating blood, directing himself by  the sight of his eyes, accommodating his body by a thousand  delicate balancings to the wind and the uneven surface of the  path, and all the time, perhaps, with his mind engaged about  America, or the dog-star, or the attributes of God - what am  I to say, or how am I to describe the thing I see?  Is that  truly a man, in the rigorous meaning of the word? or is it  not a man and something else?  What, then, are we to count  the centre-bit and axle of a being so variously compounded?   It is a question much debated.  Some read his history in a  certain intricacy of nerve and the success of successive  digestions; others find him an exiled piece of heaven blown  upon and determined by the breath of God; and both schools of  theorists will scream like scalded children at a word of  doubt.  Yet either of these views, however plausible, is  beside the question; either may be right; and I care not; I  ask a more particular answer, and to a more immediate point.   What is the man?  There is Something that was before hunger  and that remains behind after a meal.  It may or may not be  engaged in any given act or passion, but when it is, it  changes, heightens, and sanctifies.  Thus it is not engaged  in lust, where satisfaction ends the chapter; and it is  engaged in love, where no satisfaction can blunt the edge of  the desire, and where age, sickness, or alienation may deface  what was desirable without diminishing the sentiment.  This  something, which is the man, is a permanence which abides  through the vicissitudes of passion, now overwhelmed and now  triumphant, now unconscious of itself in the immediate  distress of appetite or pain, now rising unclouded above all.   So, to the man, his own central self fades and grows clear  again amid the tumult of the senses, like a revolving Pharos  in the night.  It is forgotten; it is hid, it seems, for  ever; and yet in the next calm hour he shall behold himself  once more, shining and unmoved among changes and storm.</p>
<p>Mankind, in the sense of the creeping mass that is born and  eats, that generates and dies, is but the aggregate of the  outer and lower sides of man.  This inner consciousness, this  lantern alternately obscured and shining, to and by which the  individual exists and must order his conduct, is something  special to himself and not common to the race.  His joys  delight, his sorrows wound him, according as THIS is  interested or indifferent in the affair; according as they  arise in an imperial war or in a broil conducted by the  tributary chieftains of the mind.  He may lose all, and THIS  not suffer; he may lose what is materially a trifle, and THIS  leap in his bosom with a cruel pang.  I do not speak of it to  hardened theorists: the living man knows keenly what it is I  mean.</p>
<p>&#x27;Perceive at last that thou hast in thee something better and  more divine than the things which cause the various effects,  and, as it were, pull thee by the strings.  What is that now  in thy mind? is it fear, or suspicion, or desire, or anything  of that kind?&#x27;  Thus far Marcus Aurelius, in one of the most  notable passages in any book.  Here is a question worthy to  be answered.  What is in thy mind?  What is the utterance of  your inmost self when, in a quiet hour, it can be heard  intelligibly?  It is something beyond the compass of your  thinking, inasmuch as it is yourself; but is it not of a  higher spirit than you had dreamed betweenwhiles, and erect  above all base considerations?  This soul seems hardly  touched with our infirmities; we can find in it certainly no  fear, suspicion, or desire; we are only conscious - and that  as though we read it in the eyes of some one else - of a  great and unqualified readiness.  A readiness to what? to  pass over and look beyond the objects of desire and fear, for  something else.  And this something else? this something  which is apart from desire and fear, to which all the  kingdoms of the world and the immediate death of the body are  alike indifferent and beside the point, and which yet regards  conduct - by what name are we to call it?  It may be the love  of God; or it may be an inherited (and certainly well  concealed) instinct to preserve self and propagate the race;  I am not, for the moment, averse to either theory; but it  will save time to call it righteousness.  By so doing I  intend no subterfuge to beg a question; I am indeed ready,  and more than willing, to accept the rigid consequence, and  lay aside, as far as the treachery of the reason will permit,  all former meanings attached to the word righteousness.  What  is right is that for which a man&#x27;s central self is ever ready  to sacrifice immediate or distant interests; what is wrong is  what the central self discards or rejects as incompatible  with the fixed design of righteousness.</p>
<p>To make this admission is to lay aside all hope of  definition.  That which is right upon this theory is  intimately dictated to each man by himself, but can never be  rigorously set forth in language, and never, above all,  imposed upon another.  The conscience has, then, a vision  like that of the eyes, which is incommunicable, and for the  most part illuminates none but its possessor.  When many  people perceive the same or any cognate facts, they agree  upon a word as symbol; and hence we have such words as TREE,  STAR, LOVE, HONOUR, or DEATH; hence also we have this word  RIGHT, which, like the others, we all understand, most of us  understand differently, and none can express succinctly  otherwise.  Yet even on the straitest view, we can make some  steps towards comprehension of our own superior thoughts.   For it is an incredible and most bewildering fact that a man,  through life, is on variable terms with himself; he is aware  of tiffs and reconciliations; the intimacy is at times almost  suspended, at times it is renewed again with joy.  As we said  before, his inner self or soul appears to him by successive  revelations, and is frequently obscured.  It is from a study  of these alternations that we can alone hope to discover,  even dimly, what seems right and what seems wrong to this  veiled prophet of ourself.</p>
<p>All that is in the man in the larger sense, what we call  impression as well as what we call intuition, so far as my  argument looks, we must accept.  It is not wrong to desire  food, or exercise, or beautiful surroundings, or the love of  sex, or interest which is the food of the mind.  All these  are craved; all these should be craved; to none of these in  itself does the soul demur; where there comes an undeniable  want, we recognise a demand of nature.  Yet we know that  these natural demands may be superseded; for the demands  which are common to mankind make but a shadowy consideration  in comparison to the demands of the individual soul.  Food is  almost the first prerequisite; and yet a high character will  go without food to the ruin and death of the body rather than  gain it in a manner which the spirit disavows.  Pascal laid  aside mathematics; Origen doctored his body with a knife;  every day some one is thus mortifying his dearest interests  and desires, and, in Christ&#x27;s words, entering maim into the  Kingdom of Heaven.  This is to supersede the lesser and less  harmonious affections by renunciation; and though by this  ascetic path we may get to heaven, we cannot get thither a  whole and perfect man.  But there is another way, to  supersede them by reconciliation, in which the soul and all  the faculties and senses pursue a common route and share in  one desire.  Thus, man is tormented by a very imperious  physical desire; it spoils his rest, it is not to be denied;  the doctors will tell you, not I, how it is a physical need,  like the want of food or slumber.  In the satisfaction of  this desire, as it first appears, the soul sparingly takes  part; nay, it oft unsparingly regrets and disapproves the  satisfaction.  But let the man learn to love a woman as far  as he is capable of love; and for this random affection of  the body there is substituted a steady determination, a  consent of all his powers and faculties, which supersedes,  adopts, and commands the other.  The desire survives,  strengthened, perhaps, but taught obedience and changed in  scope and character.  Life is no longer a tale of betrayals  and regrets; for the man now lives as a whole; his  consciousness now moves on uninterrupted like a river;  through all the extremes and ups and downs of passion, he  remains approvingly conscious of himself.</p>
<p>Now to me, this seems a type of that rightness which the soul  demands.  It demands that we shall not live alternately with  our opposing tendencies in continual see-saw of passion and  disgust, but seek some path on which the tendencies shall no  longer oppose, but serve each other to a common end.  It  demands that we shall not pursue broken ends, but great and  comprehensive purposes, in which soul and body may unite like  notes in a harmonious chord.  That were indeed a way of peace  and pleasure, that were indeed a heaven upon earth.  It does  not demand, however, or, to speak in measure, it does not  demand of me, that I should starve my appetites for no  purpose under heaven but as a purpose in itself; or, in a  weak despair, pluck out the eye that I have not yet learned  to guide and enjoy with wisdom.  The soul demands unity of  purpose, not the dismemberment of man; it seeks to roll up  all his strength and sweetness, all his passion and wisdom,  into one, and make of him a perfect man exulting in  perfection.  To conclude ascetically is to give up, and not  to solve, the problem.  The ascetic and the creeping hog,  although they are at different poles, have equally failed in  life.  The one has sacrificed his crew; the other brings back  his seamen in a cock-boat, and has lost the ship.  I believe  there are not many sea-captains who would plume themselves on  either result as a success.</p>
<p>But if it is righteousness thus to fuse together our divisive  impulses and march with one mind through life, there is  plainly one thing more unrighteous than all others, and one  declension which is irretrievable and draws on the rest.  And  this is to lose consciousness of oneself.  In the best of  times, it is but by flashes, when our whole nature is clear,  strong and conscious, and events conspire to leave us free,  that we enjoy communion with our soul.  At the worst, we are  so fallen and passive that we may say shortly we have none.   An arctic torpor seizes upon men.  Although built of nerves,  and set adrift in a stimulating world, they develop a  tendency to go bodily to sleep; consciousness becomes  engrossed among the reflex and mechanical parts of life; and  soon loses both the will and power to look higher  considerations in the face.  This is ruin; this is the last  failure in life; this is temporal damnation, damnation on the  spot and without the form of judgment.  &#x27;What shall it profit  a man if he gain the whole world and LOSE HIMSELF?&#x27;</p>
<p>It is to keep a man awake, to keep him alive to his own soul  and its fixed design of righteousness, that the better part  of moral and religious education is directed; not only that  of words and doctors, but the sharp ferule of calamity under  which we are all God&#x27;s scholars till we die.  If, as  teachers, we are to say anything to the purpose, we must say  what will remind the pupil of his soul; we must speak that  soul&#x27;s dialect; we must talk of life and conduct as his soul  would have him think of them.  If, from some conformity  between us and the pupil, or perhaps among all men, we do in  truth speak in such a dialect and express such views, beyond  question we shall touch in him a spring; beyond question he  will recognise the dialect as one that he himself has spoken  in his better hours; beyond question he will cry, &#x27;I had  forgotten, but now I remember; I too have eyes, and I had  forgot to use them!  I too have a soul of my own, arrogantly  upright, and to that I will listen and conform.&#x27;  In short,  say to him anything that he has once thought, or been upon  the point of thinking, or show him any view of life that he  has once clearly seen, or been upon the point of clearly  seeing; and you have done your part and may leave him to  complete the education for himself.</p>
<p>Now, the view taught at the present time seems to me to want  greatness; and the dialect in which alone it can be  intelligibly uttered is not the dialect of my soul.  It is a  sort of postponement of life; nothing quite is, but something  different is to be; we are to keep our eyes upon the indirect  from the cradle to the grave.  We are to regulate our conduct  not by desire, but by a politic eye upon the future; and to  value acts as they will bring us money or good opinion; as  they will bring us, in one word, PROFIT.  We must be what is  called respectable, and offend no one by our carriage; it  will not do to make oneself conspicuous - who knows? even in  virtue? says the Christian parent!  And we must be what is  called prudent and make money; not only because it is  pleasant to have money, but because that also is a part of  respectability, and we cannot hope to be received in society  without decent possessions.  Received in society! as if that  were the kingdom of heaven!  There is dear Mr. So-and-so; -  look at him! - so much respected - so much looked up to -  quite the Christian merchant!  And we must cut our conduct as  strictly as possible after the pattern of Mr. So-and-so; and  lay our whole lives to make money and be strictly decent.   Besides these holy injunctions, which form by far the greater  part of a youth&#x27;s training in our Christian homes, there are  at least two other doctrines.  We are to live just now as  well as we can, but scrape at last into heaven, where we  shall be good.  We are to worry through the week in a lay,  disreputable way, but, to make matters square, live a  different life on Sunday.</p>
<p>The train of thought we have been following gives us a key to  all these positions, without stepping aside to justify them  on their own ground.  It is because we have been disgusted  fifty times with physical squalls, and fifty times torn  between conflicting impulses, that we teach people this  indirect and tactical procedure in life, and to judge by  remote consequences instead of the immediate face of things.   The very desire to act as our own souls would have us,  coupled with a pathetic disbelief in ourselves, moves us to  follow the example of others; perhaps, who knows? they may be  on the right track; and the more our patterns are in number,  the better seems the chance; until, if we be acting in  concert with a whole civilised nation, there are surely a  majority of chances that we must be acting right.  And again,  how true it is that we can never behave as we wish in this  tormented sphere, and can only aspire to different and more  favourable circumstances, in order to stand out and be  ourselves wholly and rightly!  And yet once more, if in the  hurry and pressure of affairs and passions you tend to nod  and become drowsy, here are twenty-four hours of Sunday set  apart for you to hold counsel with your soul and look around  you on the possibilities of life.</p>
<p>This is not, of course, all that is to be, or even should be,  said for these doctrines.  Only, in the course of this  chapter, the reader and I have agreed upon a few catchwords,  and been looking at morals on a certain system; it was a pity  to lose an opportunity of testing the catchwords, and seeing  whether, by this system as well as by others, current  doctrines could show any probable justification.  If the  doctrines had come too badly out of the trial, it would have  condemned the system.  Our sight of the world is very narrow;  the mind but a pedestrian instrument; there&#x27;s nothing new  under the sun, as Solomon says, except the man himself; and  though that changes the aspect of everything else, yet he  must see the same things as other people, only from a  different side.</p>
<p>And now, having admitted so much, let us turn to criticism.</p>
<p>If you teach a man to keep his eyes upon what others think of  him, unthinkingly to lead the life and hold the principles of  the majority of his contemporaries, you must discredit in his  eyes the one authoritative voice of his own soul.  He may be  a docile citizen; he will never be a man.  It is ours, on the  other hand, to disregard this babble and chattering of other  men better and worse than we are, and to walk straight before  us by what light we have.  They may be right; but so, before  heaven, are we.  They may know; but we know also, and by that  knowledge we must stand or fall.  There is such a thing as  loyalty to a man&#x27;s own better self; and from those who have  not that, God help me, how am I to look for loyalty to  others?  The most dull, the most imbecile, at a certain  moment turn round, at a certain point will hear no further  argument, but stand unflinching by their own dumb, irrational  sense of right.  It is not only by steel or fire, but through  contempt and blame, that the martyr fulfils the calling of  his dear soul.  Be glad if you are not tried by such  extremities.  But although all the world ranged themselves in  one line to tell you &#x27;This is wrong,&#x27; be you your own  faithful vassal and the ambassador of God - throw down the  glove and answer &#x27;This is right.&#x27;  Do you think you are only  declaring yourself?  Perhaps in some dim way, like a child  who delivers a message not fully understood, you are opening  wider the straits of prejudice and preparing mankind for some  truer and more spiritual grasp of truth; perhaps, as you  stand forth for your own judgment, you are covering a  thousand weak ones with your body; perhaps, by this  declaration alone, you have avoided the guilt of false  witness against humanity and the little ones unborn.  It is  good, I believe, to be respectable, but much nobler to  respect oneself and utter the voice of God.  God, if there be  any God, speaks daily in a new language by the tongues of  men; the thoughts and habits of each fresh generation and  each new-coined spirit throw another light upon the universe  and contain another commentary on the printed Bibles; every  scruple, every true dissent, every glimpse of something new,  is a letter of God&#x27;s alphabet; and though there is a grave  responsibility for all who speak, is there none for those who  unrighteously keep silence and conform?  Is not that also to  conceal and cloak God&#x27;s counsel?  And how should we regard  the man of science who suppressed all facts that would not  tally with the orthodoxy of the hour?</p>
<p>Wrong?  You are as surely wrong as the sun rose this morning  round the revolving shoulder of the world.  Not truth, but  truthfulness, is the good of your endeavour.  For when will  men receive that first part and prerequisite of truth, that,  by the order of things, by the greatness of the universe, by  the darkness and partiality of man&#x27;s experience, by the  inviolate secrecy of God, kept close in His most open  revelations, every man is, and to the end of the ages must  be, wrong?  Wrong to the universe; wrong to mankind; wrong to  God.  And yet in another sense, and that plainer and nearer,  every man of men, who wishes truly, must be right.  He is  right to himself, and in the measure of his sagacity and  candour.  That let him do in all sincerity and zeal, not  sparing a thought for contrary opinions; that, for what it is  worth, let him proclaim.  Be not afraid; although he be  wrong, so also is the dead, stuffed Dagon he insults.  For  the voice of God, whatever it is, is not that stammering,  inept tradition which the people holds.  These truths survive  in travesty, swamped in a world of spiritual darkness and  confusion; and what a few comprehend and faithfully hold, the  many, in their dead jargon, repeat, degrade, and  misinterpret.</p>
<p>So far of Respectability; what the Covenanters used to call  &#x27;rank conformity&#x27;: the deadliest gag and wet blanket that can  be laid on men.  And now of Profit.  And this doctrine is  perhaps the more redoubtable, because it harms all sorts of  men; not only the heroic and self-reliant, but the obedient,  cowlike squadrons.  A man, by this doctrine, looks to  consequences at the second, or third, or fiftieth turn.  He  chooses his end, and for that, with wily turns and through a  great sea of tedium, steers this mortal bark.  There may be  political wisdom in such a view; but I am persuaded there can  spring no great moral zeal.  To look thus obliquely upon life  is the very recipe for moral slumber.  Our intention and  endeavour should be directed, not on some vague end of money  or applause, which shall come to us by a ricochet in a month  or a year, or twenty years, but on the act itself; not on the  approval of others, but on the rightness of that act.  At  every instant, at every step in life, the point has to be  decided, our soul has to be saved, heaven has to be gained or  lost.  At every step our spirits must applaud, at every step  we must set down the foot and sound the trumpet.  &#x27;This have  I done,&#x27; we must say; &#x27;right or wrong, this have I done, in  unfeigned honour of intention, as to myself and God.&#x27;  The  profit of every act should be this, that it was right for us  to do it.  Any other profit than that, if it involved a  kingdom or the woman I love, ought, if I were God&#x27;s upright  soldier, to leave me untempted.</p>
<p>It is the mark of what we call a righteous decision, that it  is made directly and for its own sake.  The whole man, mind  and body, having come to an agreement, tyrannically dictates  conduct.  There are two dispositions eternally opposed: that  in which we recognise that one thing is wrong and another  right, and that in which, not seeing any clear distinction,  we fall back on the consideration of consequences.  The truth  is, by the scope of our present teaching, nothing is thought  very wrong and nothing very right, except a few actions which  have the disadvantage of being disrespectable when found out;  the more serious part of men inclining to think all things  RATHER WRONG, the more jovial to suppose them RIGHT ENOUGH  FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES.  I will engage my head, they do not  find that view in their own hearts; they have taken it up in  a dark despair; they are but troubled sleepers talking in  their sleep.  The soul, or my soul at least, thinks very  distinctly upon many points of right and wrong, and often  differs flatly with what is held out as the thought of  corporate humanity in the code of society or the code of law.   Am I to suppose myself a monster?  I have only to read books,  the Christian Gospels for example, to think myself a monster  no longer; and instead I think the mass of people are merely  speaking in their sleep.</p>
<p>It is a commonplace, enshrined, if I mistake not, even in  school copy-books, that honour is to be sought and not fame.   I ask no other admission; we are to seek honour, upright  walking with our own conscience every hour of the day, and  not fame, the consequence, the far-off reverberation of our  footsteps.  The walk, not the rumour of the walk, is what  concerns righteousness.  Better disrespectable honour than  dishonourable fame.  Better useless or seemingly hurtful  honour, than dishonour ruling empires and filling the mouths  of thousands.  For the man must walk by what he sees, and  leave the issue with God who made him and taught him by the  fortune of his life.  You would not dishonour yourself for  money; which is at least tangible; would you do it, then, for  a doubtful forecast in politics, or another person&#x27;s theory  in morals?</p>
<p>So intricate is the scheme of our affairs, that no man can  calculate the bearing of his own behaviour even on those  immediately around him, how much less upon the world at large  or on succeeding generations!  To walk by external prudence  and the rule of consequences would require, not a man, but  God.  All that we know to guide us in this changing labyrinth  is our soul with its fixed design of righteousness, and a few  old precepts which commend themselves to that.  The precepts  are vague when we endeavour to apply them; consequences are  more entangled than a wisp of string, and their confusion is  unrestingly in change; we must hold to what we know and walk  by it.  We must walk by faith, indeed, and not by knowledge.</p>
<p>You do not love another because he is wealthy or wise or  eminently respectable: you love him because you love him;  that is love, and any other only a derision and grimace.  It  should be the same with all our actions.  If we were to  conceive a perfect man, it should be one who was never torn  between conflicting impulses, but who, on the absolute  consent of all his parts and faculties, submitted in every  action of his life to a self-dictation as absolute and  unreasoned as that which bids him love one woman and be true  to her till death.  But we should not conceive him as  sagacious, ascetical, playing off his appetites against each  other, turning the wing of public respectable immorality  instead of riding it directly down, or advancing toward his  end through a thousand sinister compromises and  considerations.  The one man might be wily, might be adroit,  might be wise, might be respectable, might be gloriously  useful; it is the other man who would be good.</p>
<p>The soul asks honour and not fame; to be upright, not to be  successful; to be good, not prosperous; to be essentially,  not outwardly, respectable.  Does your soul ask profit?  Does  it ask money?  Does it ask the approval of the indifferent  herd?  I believe not.  For my own part, I want but little  money, I hope; and I do not want to be decent at all, but to  be good.</p>
<p>LAY MORALS CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>WE have spoken of that supreme self-dictation which keeps  varying from hour to hour in its dictates with the variation  of events and circumstances.  Now, for us, that is ultimate.   It may be founded on some reasonable process, but it is not a  process which we can follow or comprehend.  And moreover the  dictation is not continuous, or not continuous except in very  lively and well-living natures; and between-whiles we must  brush along without it.  Practice is a more intricate and  desperate business than the toughest theorising; life is an  affair of cavalry, where rapid judgment and prompt action are  alone possible and right.  As a matter of fact, there is no  one so upright but he is influenced by the world&#x27;s chatter;  and no one so headlong but he requires to consider  consequences and to keep an eye on profit.  For the soul  adopts all affections and appetites without exception, and  cares only to combine them for some common purpose which  shall interest all.  Now, respect for the opinion of others,  the study of consequences, and the desire of power and  comfort, are all undeniably factors in the nature of man; and  the more undeniably since we find that, in our current  doctrines, they have swallowed up the others and are thought  to conclude in themselves all the worthy parts of man.   These, then, must also be suffered to affect conduct in the  practical domain, much or little according as they are  forcibly or feebly present to the mind of each.</p>
<p>Now, a man&#x27;s view of the universe is mostly a view of the  civilised society in which he lives.  Other men and women are  so much more grossly and so much more intimately palpable to  his perceptions, that they stand between him and all the  rest; they are larger to his eye than the sun, he hears them  more plainly than thunder, with them, by them, and for them,  he must live and die.  And hence the laws that affect his  intercourse with his fellow-men, although merely customary  and the creatures of a generation, are more clearly and  continually before his mind than those which bind him into  the eternal system of things, support him in his upright  progress on this whirling ball, or keep up the fire of his  bodily life.  And hence it is that money stands in the first  rank of considerations and so powerfully affects the choice.   For our society is built with money for mortar; money is  present in every joint of circumstance; it might be named the  social atmosphere, since, in society, it is by that alone  that men continue to live, and only through that or chance  that they can reach or affect one another.  Money gives us  food, shelter, and privacy; it permits us to be clean in  person, opens for us the doors of the theatre, gains us books  for study or pleasure, enables us to help the distresses of  others, and puts us above necessity so that we can choose the  best in life.  If we love, it enables us to meet and live  with the loved one, or even to prolong her health and life;  if we have scruples, it gives us an opportunity to be honest;  if we have any bright designs, here is what will smooth the  way to their accomplishment.  Penury is the worst slavery,  and will soon lead to death.</p>
<p>But money is only a means; it presupposes a man to use it.   The rich can go where he pleases, but perhaps please himself  nowhere.  He can buy a library or visit the whole world, but  perhaps has neither patience to read nor intelligence to see.   The table may be loaded and the appetite wanting; the purse  may be full, and the heart empty.  He may have gained the  world and lost himself; and with all his wealth around him,  in a great house and spacious and beautiful demesne, he may  live as blank a life as any tattered ditcher.  Without an  appetite, without an aspiration, void of appreciation,  bankrupt of desire and hope, there, in his great house, let  him sit and look upon his fingers.  It is perhaps a more  fortunate destiny to have a taste for collecting shells than  to be born a millionaire.  Although neither is to be  despised, it is always better policy to learn an interest  than to make a thousand pounds; for the money will soon be  spent, or perhaps you may feel no joy in spending it; but the  interest remains imperishable and ever new.  To become a  botanist, a geologist, a social philosopher, an antiquary, or  an artist, is to enlarge one&#x27;s possessions in the universe by  an incalculably higher degree, and by a far surer sort of  property, than to purchase a farm of many acres.  You had  perhaps two thousand a year before the transaction; perhaps  you have two thousand five hundred after it.  That represents  your gain in the one case.  But in the other, you have thrown  down a barrier which concealed significance and beauty.  The  blind man has learned to see.  The prisoner has opened up a  window in his cell and beholds enchanting prospects; he will  never again be a prisoner as he was; he can watch clouds and  changing seasons, ships on the river, travellers on the road,  and the stars at night; happy prisoner! his eyes have broken  jail!  And again he who has learned to love an art or science  has wisely laid up riches against the day of riches; if  prosperity come, he will not enter poor into his inheritance;  he will not slumber and forget himself in the lap of money,  or spend his hours in counting idle treasures, but be up and  briskly doing; he will have the true alchemic touch, which is  not that of Midas, but which transmutes dead money into  living delight and satisfaction.  ETRE ET PAS AVOIR - to be,  not to possess - that is the problem of life.  To be wealthy,  a rich nature is the first requisite and money but the  second.  To be of a quick and healthy blood, to share in all  honourable curiosities, to be rich in admiration and free  from envy, to rejoice greatly in the good of others, to love  with such generosity of heart that your love is still a dear  possession in absence or unkindness - these are the gifts of  fortune which money cannot buy and without which money can  buy nothing.  For what can a man possess, or what can he  enjoy, except himself?  If he enlarge his nature, it is then  that he enlarges his estates.  If his nature be happy and  valiant, he will enjoy the universe as if it were his park  and orchard.</p>
<p>But money is not only to be spent; it has also to be earned.   It is not merely a convenience or a necessary in social life;  but it is the coin in which mankind pays his wages to the  individual man.  And from this side, the question of money  has a very different scope and application.  For no man can  be honest who does not work.  Service for service.  If the  farmer buys corn, and the labourer ploughs and reaps, and the  baker sweats in his hot bakery, plainly you who eat must do  something in your turn.  It is not enough to take off your  hat, or to thank God upon your knees for the admirable  constitution of society and your own convenient situation in  its upper and more ornamental stories.  Neither is it enough  to buy the loaf with a sixpence; for then you are only  changing the point of the inquiry; and you must first have  BOUGHT THE SIXPENCE.  Service for service: how have you  bought your sixpences?  A man of spirit desires certainty in  a thing of such a nature; he must see to it that there is  some reciprocity between him and mankind; that he pays his  expenditure in service; that he has not a lion&#x27;s share in  profit and a drone&#x27;s in labour; and is not a sleeping partner  and mere costly incubus on the great mercantile concern of  mankind.</p>
<p>Services differ so widely with different gifts, and some are  so inappreciable to external tests, that this is not only a  matter for the private conscience, but one which even there  must be leniently and trustfully considered.  For remember  how many serve mankind who do no more than meditate; and how  many are precious to their friends for no more than a sweet  and joyous temper.  To perform the function of a man of  letters it is not necessary to write; nay, it is perhaps  better to be a living book.  So long as we love we serve; so  long as we are loved by others, I would almost say that we  are indispensable; and no man is useless while he has a  friend.  The true services of life are inestimable in money,  and are never paid.  Kind words and caresses, high and wise  thoughts, humane designs, tender behaviour to the weak and  suffering, and all the charities of man&#x27;s existence, are  neither bought nor sold.</p>
<p>Yet the dearest and readiest, if not the most just, criterion  of a man&#x27;s services, is the wage that mankind pays him or,  briefly, what he earns.  There at least there can be no  ambiguity.  St. Paul is fully and freely entitled to his  earnings as a tentmaker, and Socrates fully and freely  entitled to his earnings as a sculptor, although the true  business of each was not only something different, but  something which remained unpaid.  A man cannot forget that he  is not superintended, and serves mankind on parole.  He would  like, when challenged by his own conscience, to reply: &#x27;I  have done so much work, and no less, with my own hands and  brain, and taken so much profit, and no more, for my own  personal delight.&#x27;  And though St. Paul, if he had possessed  a private fortune, would probably have scorned to waste his  time in making tents, yet of all sacrifices to public opinion  none can be more easily pardoned than that by which a man,  already spiritually useful to the world, should restrict the  field of his chief usefulness to perform services more  apparent, and possess a livelihood that neither stupidity nor  malice could call in question.  Like all sacrifices to public  opinion and mere external decency, this would certainly be  wrong; for the soul should rest contented with its own  approval and indissuadably pursue its own calling.  Yet, so  grave and delicate is the question, that a man may well  hesitate before he decides it for himself; he may well fear  that he sets too high a valuation on his own endeavours after  good; he may well condescend upon a humbler duty, where  others than himself shall judge the service and proportion  the wage.</p>
<p>And yet it is to this very responsibility that the rich are  born.  They can shuffle off the duty on no other; they are  their own paymasters on parole; and must pay themselves fair  wages and no more.  For I suppose that in the course of ages,  and through reform and civil war and invasion, mankind was  pursuing some other and more general design than to set one  or two Englishmen of the nineteenth century beyond the reach  of needs and duties.  Society was scarce put together, and  defended with so much eloquence and blood, for the  convenience of two or three millionaires and a few hundred  other persons of wealth and position.  It is plain that if  mankind thus acted and suffered during all these generations,  they hoped some benefit, some ease, some wellbeing, for  themselves and their descendants; that if they supported law  and order, it was to secure fair-play for all; that if they  denied themselves in the present, they must have had some  designs upon the future.  Now, a great hereditary fortune is  a miracle of man&#x27;s wisdom and mankind&#x27;s forbearance; it has  not only been amassed and handed down, it has been suffered  to be amassed and handed down; and surely in such a  consideration as this, its possessor should find only a new  spur to activity and honour, that with all this power of  service he should not prove unserviceable, and that this mass  of treasure should return in benefits upon the race.  If he  had twenty, or thirty, or a hundred thousand at his banker&#x27;s,  or if all Yorkshire or all California were his to manage or  to sell, he would still be morally penniless, and have the  world to begin like Whittington, until he had found some way  of serving mankind.  His wage is physically in his own hand;  but, in honour, that wage must still be earned.  He is only  steward on parole of what is called his fortune.  He must  honourably perform his stewardship.  He must estimate his own  services and allow himself a salary in proportion, for that  will be one among his functions.  And while he will then be  free to spend that salary, great or little, on his own  private pleasures, the rest of his fortune he but holds and  disposes under trust for mankind; it is not his, because he  has not earned it; it cannot be his, because his services  have already been paid; but year by year it is his to  distribute, whether to help individuals whose birthright and  outfit have been swallowed up in his, or to further public  works and institutions.</p>
<p>At this rate, short of inspiration, it seems hardly possible  to be both rich and honest; and the millionaire is under a  far more continuous temptation to thieve than the labourer  who gets his shilling daily for despicable toils.  Are you  surprised?  It is even so.  And you repeat it every Sunday in  your churches.  &#x27;It is easier for a camel to pass through the  eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of  God.&#x27;  I have heard this and similar texts ingeniously  explained away and brushed from the path of the aspiring  Christian by the tender Great-heart of the parish.  One  excellent clergyman told us that the &#x27;eye of a needle&#x27; meant  a low, Oriental postern through which camels could not pass  till they were unloaded - which is very likely just; and then  went on, bravely confounding the &#x27;kingdom of God&#x27; with  heaven, the future paradise, to show that of course no rich  person could expect to carry his riches beyond the grave -  which, of course, he could not and never did.  Various greedy  sinners of the congregation drank in the comfortable doctrine  with relief.  It was worth the while having come to church  that Sunday morning!  All was plain.  The Bible, as usual,  meant nothing in particular; it was merely an obscure and  figurative school-copybook; and if a man were only  respectable, he was a man after God&#x27;s own heart.</p>
<p>Alas! I fear not.  And though this matter of a man&#x27;s services  is one for his own conscience, there are some cases in which  it is difficult to restrain the mind from judging.  Thus I  shall be very easily persuaded that a man has earned his  daily bread; and if he has but a friend or two to whom his  company is delightful at heart, I am more than persuaded at  once.  But it will be very hard to persuade me that any one  has earned an income of a hundred thousand.  What he is to  his friends, he still would be if he were made penniless to- morrow; for as to the courtiers of luxury and power, I will  neither consider them friends, nor indeed consider them at  all.  What he does for mankind there are most likely hundreds  who would do the same, as effectually for the race and as  pleasurably to themselves, for the merest fraction of this  monstrous wage.  Why it is paid, I am, therefore, unable to  conceive, and as the man pays it himself, out of funds in his  detention, I have a certain backwardness to think him honest.</p>
<p>At least, we have gained a very obvious point: that WHAT A  MAN SPENDS UPON HIMSELF, HE SHALL HAVE EARNED BY SERVICES TO  THE RACE.  Thence flows a principle for the outset of life,  which is a little different from that taught in the present  day.  I am addressing the middle and the upper classes; those  who have already been fostered and prepared for life at some  expense; those who have some choice before them, and can pick  professions; and above all, those who are what is called  independent, and need do nothing unless pushed by honour or  ambition.  In this particular the poor are happy; among them,  when a lad comes to his strength, he must take the work that  offers, and can take it with an easy conscience.  But in the  richer classes the question is complicated by the number of  opportunities and a variety of considerations.  Here, then,  this principle of ours comes in helpfully.  The young man has  to seek, not a road to wealth, but an opportunity of service;  not money, but honest work.  If he has some strong  propensity, some calling of nature, some over-weening  interest in any special field of industry, inquiry, or art,  he will do right to obey the impulse; and that for two  reasons: the first external, because there he will render the  best services; the second personal, because a demand of his  own nature is to him without appeal whenever it can be  satisfied with the consent of his other faculties and  appetites.  If he has no such elective taste, by the very  principle on which he chooses any pursuit at all he must  choose the most honest and serviceable, and not the most  highly remunerated.  We have here an external problem, not  from or to ourself, but flowing from the constitution of  society; and we have our own soul with its fixed design of  righteousness.  All that can be done is to present the  problem in proper terms, and leave it to the soul of the  individual.  Now, the problem to the poor is one of  necessity: to earn wherewithal to live, they must find  remunerative labour.  But the problem to the rich is one of  honour: having the wherewithal, they must find serviceable  labour.  Each has to earn his daily bread: the one, because  he has not yet got it to eat; the other, who has already  eaten it, because he has not yet earned it.</p>
<p>Of course, what is true of bread is true of luxuries and  comforts, whether for the body or the mind.  But the  consideration of luxuries leads us to a new aspect of the  whole question, and to a second proposition no less true, and  maybe no less startling, than the last.</p>
<p>At the present day, we, of the easier classes, are in a state  of surfeit and disgrace after meat.  Plethora has filled us  with indifference; and we are covered from head to foot with  the callosities of habitual opulence.  Born into what is  called a certain rank, we live, as the saying is, up to our  station.  We squander without enjoyment, because our fathers  squandered.  We eat of the best, not from delicacy, but from  brazen habit.  We do not keenly enjoy or eagerly desire the  presence of a luxury; we are unaccustomed to its absence.   And not only do we squander money from habit, but still more  pitifully waste it in ostentation.  I can think of no more  melancholy disgrace for a creature who professes either  reason or pleasure for his guide, than to spend the smallest  fraction of his income upon that which he does not desire;  and to keep a carriage in which you do not wish to drive, or  a butler of whom you are afraid, is a pathetic kind of folly.   Money, being a means of happiness, should make both parties  happy when it changes hands; rightly disposed, it should be  twice blessed in its employment; and buyer and seller should  alike have their twenty shillings worth of profit out of  every pound.  Benjamin Franklin went through life an altered  man, because he once paid too dearly for a penny whistle.  My  concern springs usually from a deeper source, to wit, from  having bought a whistle when I did not want one.  I find I  regret this, or would regret it if I gave myself the time,  not only on personal but on moral and philanthropical  considerations.  For, first, in a world where money is  wanting to buy books for eager students and food and medicine  for pining children, and where a large majority are starved  in their most immediate desires, it is surely base, stupid,  and cruel to squander money when I am pushed by no appetite  and enjoy no return of genuine satisfaction.  My philanthropy  is wide enough in scope to include myself; and when I have  made myself happy, I have at least one good argument that I  have acted rightly; but where that is not so, and I have  bought and not enjoyed, my mouth is closed, and I conceive  that I have robbed the poor.  And, second, anything I buy or  use which I do not sincerely want or cannot vividly enjoy,  disturbs the balance of supply and demand, and contributes to  remove industrious hands from the production of what is  useful or pleasurable and to keep them busy upon ropes of  sand and things that are a weariness to the flesh.  That  extravagance is truly sinful, and a very silly sin to boot,  in which we impoverish mankind and ourselves.  It is another  question for each man&#x27;s heart.  He knows if he can enjoy what  he buys and uses; if he cannot, he is a dog in the manger;  nay, it he cannot, I contend he is a thief, for nothing  really belongs to a man which he cannot use.  Proprietor is  connected with propriety; and that only is the man&#x27;s which is  proper to his wants and faculties.</p>
<p>A youth, in choosing a career, must not be alarmed by  poverty.  Want is a sore thing, but poverty does not imply  want.  It remains to be seen whether with half his present  income, or a third, he cannot, in the most generous sense,  live as fully as at present.  He is a fool who objects to  luxuries; but he is also a fool who does not protest against  the waste of luxuries on those who do not desire and cannot  enjoy them.  It remains to be seen, by each man who would  live a true life to himself and not a merely specious life to  society, how many luxuries he truly wants and to how many he  merely submits as to a social propriety; and all these last  he will immediately forswear.  Let him do this, and he will  be surprised to find how little money it requires to keep him  in complete contentment and activity of mind and senses.   Life at any level among the easy classes is conceived upon a  principle of rivalry, where each man and each household must  ape the tastes and emulate the display of others.  One is  delicate in eating, another in wine, a third in furniture or  works of art or dress; and I, who care nothing for any of  these refinements, who am perhaps a plain athletic creature  and love exercise, beef, beer, flannel shirts and a camp bed,  am yet called upon to assimilate all these other tastes and  make these foreign occasions of expenditure my own.  It may  be cynical: I am sure I shall be told it is selfish; but I  will spend my money as I please and for my own intimate  personal gratification, and should count myself a nincompoop  indeed to lay out the colour of a halfpenny on any fancied  social decency or duty.  I shall not wear gloves unless my  hands are cold, or unless I am born with a delight in them.   Dress is my own affair, and that of one other in the world;  that, in fact and for an obvious reason, of any woman who  shall chance to be in love with me.  I shall lodge where I  have a mind.  If I do not ask society to live with me, they  must be silent; and even if I do, they have no further right  but to refuse the invitation!  There is a kind of idea abroad  that a man must live up to his station, that his house, his  table, and his toilette, shall be in a ratio of equivalence,  and equally imposing to the world.  If this is in the Bible,  the passage has eluded my inquiries.  If it is not in the  Bible, it is nowhere but in the heart of the fool.  Throw  aside this fancy.  See what you want, and spend upon that;  distinguish what you do not care about, and spend nothing  upon that.  There are not many people who can differentiate  wines above a certain and that not at all a high price.  Are  you sure you are one of these?  Are you sure you prefer  cigars at sixpence each to pipes at some fraction of a  farthing?  Are you sure you wish to keep a gig?  Do you care  about where you sleep, or are you not as much at your ease in  a cheap lodging as in an Elizabethan manor-house?  Do you  enjoy fine clothes?  It is not possible to answer these  questions without a trial; and there is nothing more obvious  to my mind, than that a man who has not experienced some ups  and downs, and been forced to live more cheaply than in his  father&#x27;s house, has still his education to begin.  Let the  experiment be made, and he will find to his surprise that he  has been eating beyond his appetite up to that hour; that the  cheap lodging, the cheap tobacco, the rough country clothes,  the plain table, have not only no power to damp his spirits,  but perhaps give him as keen pleasure in the using as the  dainties that he took, betwixt sleep and waking, in his  former callous and somnambulous submission to wealth.</p>
<p>The true Bohemian, a creature lost to view under the  imaginary Bohemians of literature, is exactly described by  such a principle of life.  The Bohemian of the novel, who  drinks more than is good for him and prefers anything to  work, and wears strange clothes, is for the most part a  respectable Bohemian, respectable in disrespectability,  living for the outside, and an adventurer.  But the man I  mean lives wholly to himself, does what he wishes, and not  what is thought proper, buys what he wants for himself, and  not what is thought proper, works at what he believes he can  do well and not what will bring him in money or favour.  You  may be the most respectable of men, and yet a true Bohemian.   And the test is this: a Bohemian, for as poor as he may be,  is always open-handed to his friends; he knows what he can do  with money and how he can do without it, a far rarer and more  useful knowledge; he has had less, and continued to live in  some contentment; and hence he cares not to keep more, and  shares his sovereign or his shilling with a friend.  The  poor, if they are generous, are Bohemian in virtue of their  birth.  Do you know where beggars go?  Not to the great  houses where people sit dazed among their thousands, but to  the doors of poor men who have seen the world; and it was the  widow who had only two mites, who cast half her fortune into  the treasury.</p>
<p>But a young man who elects to save on dress or on lodging, or  who in any way falls out of the level of expenditure which is  common to his level in society, falls out of society  altogether.  I suppose the young man to have chosen his  career on honourable principles; he finds his talents and  instincts can be best contented in a certain pursuit; in a  certain industry, he is sure that he is serving mankind with  a healthy and becoming service; and he is not sure that he  would be doing so, or doing so equally well, in any other  industry within his reach.  Then that is his true sphere in  life; not the one in which he was born to his father, but the  one which is proper to his talents and instincts.  And  suppose he does fall out of society, is that a cause of  sorrow?  Is your heart so dead that you prefer the  recognition of many to the love of a few?  Do you think  society loves you?  Put it to the proof.  Decline in material  expenditure, and you will find they care no more for you than  for the Khan of Tartary.  You will lose no friends.  If you  had any, you will keep them.  Only those who were friends to  your coat and equipage will disappear; the smiling faces will  disappear as by enchantment; but the kind hearts will remain  steadfastly kind.  Are you so lost, are you so dead, are you  so little sure of your own soul and your own footing upon  solid fact, that you prefer before goodness and happiness the  countenance of sundry diners-out, who will flee from you at a  report of ruin, who will drop you with insult at a shadow of  disgrace, who do not know you and do not care to know you but  by sight, and whom you in your turn neither know nor care to  know in a more human manner?  Is it not the principle of  society, openly avowed, that friendship must not interfere  with business; which being paraphrased, means simply that a  consideration of money goes before any consideration of  affection known to this cold-blooded gang, that they have not  even the honour of thieves, and will rook their nearest and  dearest as readily as a stranger?  I hope I would go as far  as most to serve a friend; but I declare openly I would not  put on my hat to do a pleasure to society.  I may starve my  appetites and control my temper for the sake of those I love;  but society shall take me as I choose to be, or go without  me.  Neither they nor I will lose; for where there is no  love, it is both laborious and unprofitable to associate.</p>
<p>But it is obvious that if it is only right for a man to spend  money on that which he can truly and thoroughly enjoy, the  doctrine applies with equal force to the rich and to the  poor, to the man who has amassed many thousands as well as to  the youth precariously beginning life.  And it may be asked,  Is not this merely preparing misers, who are not the best of  company?  But the principle was this: that which a man has  not fairly earned, and, further, that which he cannot fully  enjoy, does not belong to him, but is a part of mankind&#x27;s  treasure which he holds as steward on parole.  To mankind,  then, it must be made profitable; and how this should be done  is, once more, a problem which each man must solve for  himself, and about which none has a right to judge him.  Yet  there are a few considerations which are very obvious and may  here be stated.  Mankind is not only the whole in general,  but every one in particular.  Every man or woman is one of  mankind&#x27;s dear possessions; to his or her just brain, and  kind heart, and active hands, mankind intrusts some of its  hopes for the future; he or she is a possible well-spring of  good acts and source of blessings to the race.  This money  which you do not need, which, in a rigid sense, you do not  want, may therefore be returned not only in public  benefactions to the race, but in private kindnesses.  Your  wife, your children, your friends stand nearest to you, and  should be helped the first.  There at least there can be  little imposture, for you know their necessities of your own  knowledge.  And consider, if all the world did as you did,  and according to their means extended help in the circle of  their affections, there would be no more crying want in times  of plenty and no more cold, mechanical charity given with a  doubt and received with confusion.  Would not this simple  rule make a new world out of the old and cruel one which we  inhabit?</p>

<p>FATHER DAMIEN AN OPEN LETTER TO THE REVEREND DR. HYDE OF HONOLULU</p>
<p>SYDNEY, FEBRUARY 25, 1890.</p>
<p>SIR, - It may probably occur to you that we have met, and  visited, and conversed; on my side, with interest.  You may  remember that you have done me several courtesies, for which  I was prepared to be grateful.  But there are duties which  come before gratitude, and offences which justly divide  friends, far more acquaintances.  Your letter to the Reverend  H. B. Gage is a document which, in my sight, if you had  filled me with bread when I was starving, if you had sat up  to nurse my father when he lay a-dying, would yet absolve me  from the bonds of gratitude.  You know enough, doubtless, of  the process of canonisation to be aware that, a hundred years  after the death of Damien, there will appear a man charged  with the painful office of the DEVIL&#x27;S ADVOCATE.  After that  noble brother of mine, and of all frail clay, shall have lain  a century at rest, one shall accuse, one defend him.  The  circumstance is unusual that the devil&#x27;s advocate should be a  volunteer, should be a member of a sect immediately rival,  and should make haste to take upon himself his ugly office  ere the bones are cold; unusual, and of a taste which I shall  leave my readers free to qualify; unusual, and to me  inspiring.  If I have at all learned the trade of using words  to convey truth and to arouse emotion, you have at last  furnished me with a subject.  For it is in the interest of  all mankind, and the cause of public decency in every quarter  of the world, not only that Damien should be righted, but  that you and your letter should be displayed at length, in  their true colours, to the public eye.</p>
<p>To do this properly, I must begin by quoting you at large: I  shall then proceed to criticise your utterance from several  points of view, divine and human, in the course of which I  shall attempt to draw again, and with more specification, the  character of the dead saint whom it has pleased you to  vilify: so much being done, I shall say farewell to you for  ever.</p>
<p>&#x27;HONOLULU, &#x27;AUGUST 2, 1889.</p>
<p>&#x27;Rev. H. B. GAGE.</p>
<p>&#x27;DEAR BROTHER, - In answer to your inquiries about Father  Damien, I can only reply that we who knew the man are  surprised at the extravagant newspaper laudations, as if he  was a most saintly philanthropist.  The simple truth is, he  was a coarse, dirty man, head-strong and bigoted.  He was not  sent to Molokai, but went there without orders; did not stay  at the leper settlement (before he became one himself), but  circulated freely over the whole island (less than half the  island is devoted to the lepers), and he came often to  Honolulu.  He had no hand in the reforms and improvements  inaugurated, which were the work of our Board of Health, as  occasion required and means were provided.  He was not a pure  man in his relations with women, and the leprosy of which he  died should be attributed to his vices and carelessness.   Others have done much for the lepers, our own ministers, the  government physicians, and so forth, but never with the  Catholic idea of meriting eternal life. - Yours, etc.,</p>
<p>&#x27;C. M. HYDE.&#x27; (1)</p>
<p>To deal fitly with a letter so extraordinary, I must draw at  the outset on my private knowledge of the signatory and his  sect.  It may offend others; scarcely you, who have been so  busy to collect, so bold to publish, gossip on your rivals.   And this is perhaps the moment when I may best explain to you  the character of what you are to read: I conceive you as a  man quite beyond and below the reticences of civility: with  what measure you mete, with that shall it be measured you  again; with you, at last, I rejoice to feel the button off  the foil and to plunge home.  And if in aught that I shall  say I should offend others, your colleagues, whom I respect  and remember with affection, I can but offer them my regret;  I am not free, I am inspired by the consideration of  interests far more large; and such pain as can be inflicted  by anything from me must be indeed trifling when compared  with the pain with which they read your letter.  It is not  the hangman, but the criminal, that brings dishonour on the  house.</p>
<p>You belong, sir, to a sect - I believe my sect, and that in  which my ancestors laboured - which has enjoyed, and partly  failed to utilise, an exceptional advantage in the islands of  Hawaii.  The first missionaries came; they found the land  already self-purged of its old and bloody faith; they were  embraced, almost on their arrival, with enthusiasm; what  troubles they supported came far more from whites than from  Hawaiians; and to these last they stood (in a rough figure)  in the shoes of God.  This is not the place to enter into the  degree or causes of their failure, such as it is.  One  element alone is pertinent, and must here be plainly dealt  with.  In the course of their evangelical calling, they - or  too many of them - grew rich.  It may be news to you that the  houses of missionaries are a cause of mocking on the streets  of Honolulu.  It will at least be news to you, that when I  returned your civil visit, the driver of my cab commented on  the size, the taste, and the comfort of your home.  It would  have been news certainly to myself, had any one told me that  afternoon that I should live to drag such matter into print.   But you see, sir, how you degrade better men to your own  level; and it is needful that those who are to judge betwixt  you and me, betwixt Damien and the devil&#x27;s advocate, should  understand your letter to have been penned in a house which  could raise, and that very justly, the envy and the comments  of the passers-by.  I think (to employ a phrase of yours  which I admire) it &#x27;should be attributed&#x27; to you that you  have never visited the scene of Damien&#x27;s life and death.  If  you had, and had recalled it, and looked about your pleasant  rooms, even your pen perhaps would have been stayed.</p>
<p>Your sect (and remember, as far as any sect avows me, it is  mine) has not done ill in a worldly sense in the Hawaiian  Kingdom.  When calamity befell their innocent parishioners,  when leprosy descended and took root in the Eight Islands, a  QUID PRO QUO was to be looked for.  To that prosperous  mission, and to you, as one of its adornments, God had sent  at last an opportunity.  I know I am touching here upon a  nerve acutely sensitive.  I know that others of your  colleagues look back on the inertia of your Church, and the  intrusive and decisive heroism of Damien, with something  almost to be called remorse.  I am sure it is so with  yourself; I am persuaded your letter was inspired by a  certain envy, not essentially ignoble, and the one human  trait to be espied in that performance.  You were thinking of  the lost chance, the past day; of that which should have been  conceived and was not; of the service due and not rendered.   Time was, said the voice in your ear, in your pleasant room,  as you sat raging and writing; and if the words written were  base beyond parallel, the rage, I am happy to repeat - it is  the only compliment I shall pay you - the rage was almost  virtuous.  But, sir, when we have failed, and another has  succeeded; when we have stood by, and another has stepped in;  when we sit and grow bulky in our charming mansions, and a  plain, uncouth peasant steps into the battle, under the eyes  of God, and succours the afflicted, and consoles the dying,  and is himself afflicted in his turn, and dies upon the field  of honour - the battle cannot be retrieved as your unhappy  irritation has suggested.  It is a lost battle, and lost for  ever.  One thing remained to you in your defeat - some rags  of common honour; and these you have made haste to cast away.</p>
<p>Common honour; not the honour of having done anything right,  but the honour of not having done aught conspicuously foul;  the honour of the inert: that was what remained to you.  We  are not all expected to be Damiens; a man may conceive his  duty more narrowly, he may love his comforts better; and none  will cast a stone at him for that.  But will a gentleman of  your reverend profession allow me an example from the fields  of gallantry?  When two gentlemen compete for the favour of a  lady, and the one succeeds and the other is rejected, and (as  will sometimes happen) matter damaging to the successful  rival&#x27;s credit reaches the ear of the defeated, it is held by  plain men of no pretensions that his mouth is, in the  circumstance, almost necessarily closed.  Your Church and  Damien&#x27;s were in Hawaii upon a rivalry to do well: to help,  to edify, to set divine examples.  You having (in one huge  instance) failed, and Damien succeeded, I marvel it should  not have occurred to you that you were doomed to silence;  that when you had been outstripped in that high rivalry, and  sat inglorious in the midst of your wellbeing, in your  pleasant room - and Damien, crowned with glories and horrors,  toiled and rotted in that pigsty of his under the cliffs of  Kalawao - you, the elect who would not, were the last man on  earth to collect and propagate gossip on the volunteer who  would and did.</p>
<p>I think I see you - for I try to see you in the flesh as I  write these sentences - I think I see you leap at the word  pigsty, a hyperbolical expression at the best.  &#x27;He had no  hand in the reforms,&#x27; he was &#x27;a coarse, dirty man&#x27;; these  were your own words; and you may think it possible that I am  come to support you with fresh evidence.  In a sense, it is  even so.  Damien has been too much depicted with a  conventional halo and conventional features; so drawn by men  who perhaps had not the eye to remark or the pen to express  the individual; or who perhaps were only blinded and silenced  by generous admiration, such as I partly envy for myself -  such as you, if your soul were enlightened, would envy on  your bended knees.  It is the least defect of such a method  of portraiture that it makes the path easy for the devil&#x27;s  advocate, and leaves for the misuse of the slanderer a  considerable field of truth.  For the truth that is  suppressed by friends is the readiest weapon of the enemy.   The world, in your despite, may perhaps owe you something, if  your letter be the means of substituting once for all a  credible likeness for a wax abstraction.  For, if that world  at all remember you, on the day when Damien of Molokai shall  be named Saint, it will be in virtue of one work: your letter  to the Reverend H. B. Gage.</p>
<p>You may ask on what authority I speak.  It was my inclement  destiny to become acquainted, not with Damien, but with Dr.  Hyde.  When I visited the lazaretto, Damien was already in  his resting grave.  But such information as I have, I  gathered on the spot in conversation with those who knew him  well and long: some indeed who revered his memory; but others  who had sparred and wrangled with him, who beheld him with no  halo, who perhaps regarded him with small respect, and  through whose unprepared and scarcely partial communications  the plain, human features of the man shone on me  convincingly.  These gave me what knowledge I possess; and I  learnt it in that scene where it could be most completely and  sensitively understood - Kalawao, which you have never  visited, about which you have never so much as endeavoured to  inform yourself; for, brief as your letter is, you have found  the means to stumble into that confession.  &#x27;LESS THAN ONE- HALF of the island,&#x27; you say, &#x27;is devoted to the lepers.&#x27;  Molokai - &#x27;MOLOKAI AHINA,&#x27; the &#x27;grey,&#x27; lofty, and most  desolate island - along all its northern side plunges a front  of precipice into a sea of unusual profundity.  This range of  cliff is, from east to west, the true end and frontier of the  island.  Only in one spot there projects into the ocean a  certain triangular and rugged down, grassy, stony, windy, and  rising in the midst into a hill with a dead crater: the whole  bearing to the cliff that overhangs it somewhat the same  relation as a bracket to a wall.  With this hint you will now  be able to pick out the leper station on a map; you will be  able to judge how much of Molokai is thus cut off between the  surf and precipice, whether less than a half, or less than a  quarter, or a fifth, or a tenth - or, say, a twentieth; and  the next time you burst into print you will be in a position  to share with us the issue of your calculations.</p>
<p>I imagine you to be one of those persons who talk with  cheerfulness of that place which oxen and wain-ropes could  not drag you to behold.  You, who do not even know its  situation on the map, probably denounce sensational  descriptions, stretching your limbs the while in your  pleasant parlour on Beretania Street.  When I was pulled  ashore there one early morning, there sat with me in the boat  two sisters, bidding farewell (in humble imitation of Damien)  to the lights and joys of human life.  One of these wept  silently; I could not withhold myself from joining her.  Had  you been there, it is my belief that nature would have  triumphed even in you; and as the boat drew but a little  nearer, and you beheld the stairs crowded with abominable  deformations of our common manhood, and saw yourself landing  in the midst of such a population as only now and then  surrounds us in the horror of a nightmare - what a haggard  eye you would have rolled over your reluctant shoulder  towards the house on Beretania Street!  Had you gone on; had  you found every fourth face a blot upon the landscape; had  you visited the hospital and seen the butt-ends of human  beings lying there almost unrecognisable, but still  breathing, still thinking, still remembering; you would have  understood that life in the lazaretto is an ordeal from which  the nerves of a man&#x27;s spirit shrink, even as his eye quails  under the brightness of the sun; you would have felt it was  (even to-day) a pitiful place to visit and a hell to dwell  in.  It is not the fear of possible infection.  That seems a  little thing when compared with the pain, the pity, and the  disgust of the visitor&#x27;s surroundings, and the atmosphere of  affliction, disease, and physical disgrace in which he  breathes.  I do not think I am a man more than usually timid;  but I never recall the days and nights I spent upon that  island promontory (eight days and seven nights), without  heartfelt thankfulness that I am somewhere else.  I find in  my diary that I speak of my stay as a &#x27;grinding experience&#x27;:  I have once jotted in the margin, &#x27;HARROWING is the word&#x27;;  and when the MOKOLII bore me at last towards the outer world,  I kept repeating to myself, with a new conception of their  pregnancy, those simple words of the song -</p>
<p>&#x27;&#x27;Tis the most distressful country that ever yet was seen.&#x27;</p>
<p>And observe: that which I saw and suffered from was a  settlement purged, bettered, beautified; the new village  built, the hospital and the Bishop-Home excellently arranged;  the sisters, the doctor, and the missionaries, all  indefatigable in their noble tasks.  It was a different place  when Damien came there and made his great renunciation, and  slept that first night under a tree amidst his rotting  brethren: alone with pestilence; and looking forward (with  what courage, with what pitiful sinkings of dread, God only  knows) to a lifetime of dressing sores and stumps.</p>
<p>You will say, perhaps, I am too sensitive, that sights as  painful abound in cancer hospitals and are confronted daily  by doctors and nurses.  I have long learned to admire and  envy the doctors and the nurses.  But there is no cancer  hospital so large and populous as Kalawao and Kalaupapa; and  in such a matter every fresh case, like every inch of length  in the pipe of an organ, deepens the note of the impression;  for what daunts the onlooker is that monstrous sum of human  suffering by which he stands surrounded.  Lastly, no doctor  or nurse is called upon to enter once for all the doors of  that gehenna; they do not say farewell, they need not abandon  hope, on its sad threshold; they but go for a time to their  high calling, and can look forward as they go to relief, to  recreation, and to rest.  But Damien shut-to with his own  hand the doors of his own sepulchre.</p>
<p>I shall now extract three passages from my diary at Kalawao.</p>
<p>A.  &#x27;Damien is dead and already somewhat ungratefully  remembered in the field of his labours and sufferings.  &quot;He  was a good man, but very officious,&quot; says one.  Another tells  me he had fallen (as other priests so easily do) into  something of the ways and habits of thought of a Kanaka; but  he had the wit to recognise the fact, and the good sense to  laugh at&#x27; [over] &#x27;it.  A plain man it seems he was; I cannot  find he was a popular.&#x27;</p>
<p>B.  &#x27;After Ragsdale&#x27;s death&#x27; [Ragsdale was a famous Luna, or  overseer, of the unruly settlement] &#x27;there followed a brief  term of office by Father Damien which served only to publish  the weakness of that noble man.  He was rough in his ways,  and he had no control.  Authority was relaxed; Damien&#x27;s life  was threatened, and he was soon eager to resign.&#x27;</p>
<p>C.  &#x27;Of Damien I begin to have an idea.  He seems to have  been a man of the peasant class, certainly of the peasant  type: shrewd, ignorant and bigoted, yet with an open mind,  and capable of receiving and digesting a reproof if it were  bluntly administered; superbly generous in the least thing as  well as in the greatest, and as ready to give his last shirt  (although not without human grumbling) as he had been to  sacrifice his life; essentially indiscreet and officious,  which made him a troublesome colleague; domineering in all  his ways, which made him incurably unpopular with the  Kanakas, but yet destitute of real authority, so that his  boys laughed at him and he must carry out his wishes by the  means of bribes.  He learned to have a mania for doctoring;  and set up the Kanakas against the remedies of his regular  rivals: perhaps (if anything matter at all in the treatment  of such a disease) the worst thing that he did, and certainly  the easiest.  The best and worst of the man appear very  plainly in his dealings with Mr. Chapman&#x27;s money; he had  originally laid it out&#x27; [intended to lay it out] &#x27;entirely  for the benefit of Catholics, and even so not wisely; but  after a long, plain talk, he admitted his error fully and  revised the list.  The sad state of the boys&#x27; home is in part  the result of his lack of control; in part, of his own  slovenly ways and false ideas of hygiene.  Brother officials  used to call it &quot;Damien&#x27;s Chinatown.&quot;  &quot;Well,&quot; they would  say, &quot;your China-town keeps growing.&quot;  And he would laugh  with perfect good-nature, and adhere to his errors with  perfect obstinacy.  So much I have gathered of truth about  this plain, noble human brother and father of ours; his  imperfections are the traits of his face, by which we know  him for our fellow; his martyrdom and his example nothing can  lessen or annul; and only a person here on the spot can  properly appreciate their greatness.&#x27;</p>
<p>I have set down these private passages, as you perceive,  without correction; thanks to you, the public has them in  their bluntness.  They are almost a list of the man&#x27;s faults,  for it is rather these that I was seeking: with his virtues,  with the heroic profile of his life, I and the world were  already sufficiently acquainted.  I was besides a little  suspicious of Catholic testimony; in no ill sense, but merely  because Damien&#x27;s admirers and disciples were the least likely  to be critical.  I know you will be more suspicious still;  and the facts set down above were one and all collected from  the lips of Protestants who had opposed the father in his  life.  Yet I am strangely deceived, or they build up the  image of a man, with all his weaknesses, essentially heroic,  and alive with rugged honesty, generosity, and mirth.</p>
<p>Take it for what it is, rough private jottings of the worst  sides of Damien&#x27;s character, collected from the lips of those  who had laboured with and (in your own phrase) &#x27;knew the  man&#x27;; - though I question whether Damien would have said that  he knew you.  Take it, and observe with wonder how well you  were served by your gossips, how ill by your intelligence and  sympathy; in how many points of fact we are at one, and how  widely our appreciations vary.  There is something wrong  here; either with you or me.  It is possible, for instance,  that you, who seem to have so many ears in Kalawao, had heard  of the affair of Mr. Chapman&#x27;s money, and were singly struck  by Damien&#x27;s intended wrong-doing.  I was struck with that  also, and set it fairly down; but I was struck much more by  the fact that he had the honesty of mind to be convinced.  I  may here tell you that it was a long business; that one of  his colleagues sat with him late into the night, multiplying  arguments and accusations; that the father listened as usual  with &#x27;perfect good-nature and perfect obstinacy&#x27;; but at the  last, when he was persuaded - &#x27;Yes,&#x27; said he, &#x27;I am very much  obliged to you; you have done me a service; it would have  been a theft.&#x27;  There are many (not Catholics merely) who  require their heroes and saints to be infallible; to these  the story will be painful; not to the true lovers, patrons,  and servants of mankind.</p>
<p>And I take it, this is a type of our division; that you are  one of those who have an eye for faults and failures; that  you take a pleasure to find and publish them; and that,  having found them, you make haste to forget the overvailing  virtues and the real success which had alone introduced them  to your knowledge.  It is a dangerous frame of mind.  That  you may understand how dangerous, and into what a situation  it has already brought you, we will (if you please) go hand- in-hand through the different phrases of your letter, and  candidly examine each from the point of view of its truth,  its appositeness, and its charity.</p>
<p>Damien was COARSE.</p>
<p>It is very possible.  You make us sorry for the lepers, who  had only a coarse old peasant for their friend and father.   But you, who were so refined, why were you not there, to  cheer them with the lights of culture?  Or may I remind you  that we have some reason to doubt if John the Baptist were  genteel; and in the case of Peter, on whose career you  doubtless dwell approvingly in the pulpit, no doubt at all he  was a &#x27;coarse, headstrong&#x27; fisherman!  Yet even in our  Protestant Bibles Peter is called Saint.</p>
<p>Damien was DIRTY.</p>
<p>He was.  Think of the poor lepers annoyed with this dirty  comrade!  But the clean Dr. Hyde was at his food in a fine  house.</p>
<p>Damien was HEADSTRONG.</p>
<p>I believe you are right again; and I thank God for his strong  head and heart.</p>
<p>Damien was BIGOTED.</p>
<p>I am not fond of bigots myself, because they are not fond of  me.  But what is meant by bigotry, that we should regard it  as a blemish in a priest?  Damien believed his own religion  with the simplicity of a peasant or a child; as I would I  could suppose that you do.  For this, I wonder at him some  way off; and had that been his only character, should have  avoided him in life.  But the point of interest in Damien,  which has caused him to be so much talked about and made him  at last the subject of your pen and mine, was that, in him,  his bigotry, his intense and narrow faith, wrought potently  for good, and strengthened him to be one of the world&#x27;s  heroes and exemplars.</p>
<p>Damien WAS NOT SENT TO MOLOKAI, BUT WENT THERE WITHOUT  ORDERS.</p>
<p>Is this a misreading? or do you really mean the words for  blame?  I have heard Christ, in the pulpits of our Church,  held up for imitation on the ground that His sacrifice was  voluntary.  Does Dr. Hyde think otherwise?</p>
<p>Damien DID NOT STAY AT THE SETTLEMENT, ETC.</p>
<p>It is true he was allowed many indulgences.  Am I to  understand that you blame the father for profiting by these,  or the officers for granting them?  In either case, it is a  mighty Spartan standard to issue from the house on Beretania  Street; and I am convinced you will find yourself with few  supporters.</p>
<p>Damien HAD NO HAND IN THE REFORMS, ETC.</p>
<p>I think even you will admit that I have already been frank in  my description of the man I am defending; but before I take  you up upon this head, I will be franker still, and tell you  that perhaps nowhere in the world can a man taste a more  pleasurable sense of contrast than when he passes from  Damien&#x27;s &#x27;Chinatown&#x27; at Kalawao to the beautiful Bishop-Home  at Kalaupapa.  At this point, in my desire to make all fair  for you, I will break my rule and adduce Catholic testimony.   Here is a passage from my diary about my visit to the  Chinatown, from which you will see how it is (even now)  regarded by its own officials: &#x27;We went round all the  dormitories, refectories, etc. - dark and dingy enough, with  a superficial cleanliness, which he&#x27; [Mr. Dutton, the lay- brother] &#x27;did not seek to defend.  &quot;It is almost decent,&quot;  said he; &quot;the sisters will make that all right when we get  them here.&quot;&#x27;  And yet I gathered it was already better since  Damien was dead, and far better than when he was there alone  and had his own (not always excellent) way.  I have now come  far enough to meet you on a common ground of fact; and I tell  you that, to a mind not prejudiced by jealousy, all the  reforms of the lazaretto, and even those which he most  vigorously opposed, are properly the work of Damien.  They  are the evidence of his success; they are what his heroism  provoked from the reluctant and the careless.  Many were  before him in the field; Mr. Meyer, for instance, of whose  faithful work we hear too little: there have been many since;  and some had more worldly wisdom, though none had more  devotion, than our saint.  Before his day, even you will  confess, they had effected little.  It was his part, by one  striking act of martyrdom, to direct all men&#x27;s eyes on that  distressful country.  At a blow, and with the price of his  life, he made the place illustrious and public.  And that, if  you will consider largely, was the one reform needful;  pregnant of all that should succeed.  It brought money; it  brought (best individual addition of them all) the sisters;  it brought supervision, for public opinion and public  interest landed with the man at Kalawao.  If ever any man  brought reforms, and died to bring them, it was he.  There is  not a clean cup or towel in the Bishop-Home, but dirty Damien  washed it.</p>
<p>Damien WAS NOT A PURE MAN IN HIS RELATIONS WITH WOMEN, ETC.</p>
<p>How do you know that?  Is this the nature of the conversation  in that house on Beretania Street which the cabman envied,  driving past? - racy details of the misconduct of the poor  peasant priest, toiling under the cliffs of Molokai?</p>
<p>Many have visited the station before me; they seem not to  have heard the rumour.  When I was there I heard many  shocking tales, for my informants were men speaking with the  plainness of the laity; and I heard plenty of complaints of  Damien.  Why was this never mentioned? and how came it to you  in the retirement of your clerical parlour?</p>
<p>But I must not even seem to deceive you.  This scandal, when  I read it in your letter, was not new to me.  I had heard it  once before; and I must tell you how.  There came to Samoa a  man from Honolulu; he, in a public-house on the beach,  volunteered the statement that Damien had &#x27;contracted the  disease from having connection with the female lepers&#x27;; and I  find a joy in telling you how the report was welcomed in a  public-house.  A man sprang to his feet; I am not at liberty  to give his name, but from what I heard I doubt if you would  care to have him to dinner in Beretania Street.  &#x27;You  miserable little - &#x27; (here is a word I dare not print, it  would so shock your ears).  &#x27;You miserable little - ,&#x27; he  cried, &#x27;if the story were a thousand times true, can&#x27;t you  see you are a million times a lower - for daring to repeat  it?&#x27;  I wish it could be told of you that when the report  reached you in your house, perhaps after family worship, you  had found in your soul enough holy anger to receive it with  the same expressions; ay, even with that one which I dare not  print; it would not need to have been blotted away, like  Uncle Toby&#x27;s oath, by the tears of the recording angel; it  would have been counted to you for your brightest  righteousness.  But you have deliberately chosen the part of  the man from Honolulu, and you have played it with  improvements of your own.  The man from Honolulu - miserable,  leering creature - communicated the tale to a rude knot of  beach-combing drinkers in a public-house, where (I will so  far agree with your temperance opinions) man is not always at  his noblest; and the man from Honolulu had himself been  drinking - drinking, we may charitably fancy, to excess.  It  was to your &#x27;Dear Brother, the Reverend H. B. Gage,&#x27; that you  chose to communicate the sickening story; and the blue ribbon  which adorns your portly bosom forbids me to allow you the  extenuating plea that you were drunk when it was done.  Your  &#x27;dear brother&#x27; - a brother indeed - made haste to deliver up  your letter (as a means of grace, perhaps) to the religious  papers; where, after many months, I found and read and  wondered at it; and whence I have now reproduced it for the  wonder of others.  And you and your dear brother have, by  this cycle of operations, built up a contrast very edifying  to examine in detail.  The man whom you would not care to  have to dinner, on the one side; on the other, the Reverend  Dr. Hyde and the Reverend H. B. Gage: the Apia bar-room, the  Honolulu manse.</p>
<p>But I fear you scarce appreciate how you appear to your  fellow-men; and to bring it home to you, I will suppose your  story to be true.  I will suppose - and God forgive me for  supposing it - that Damien faltered and stumbled in his  narrow path of duty; I will suppose that, in the horror of  his isolation, perhaps in the fever of incipient disease, he,  who was doing so much more than he had sworn, failed in the  letter of his priestly oath - he, who was so much a better  man than either you or me, who did what we have never dreamed  of daring - he too tasted of our common frailty.  &#x27;O, Iago,  the pity of it!&#x27;  The least tender should be moved to tears;  the most incredulous to prayer.  And all that you could do  was to pen your letter to the Reverend H. B. Gage!</p>
<p>Is it growing at all clear to you what a picture you have  drawn of your own heart?  I will try yet once again to make  it clearer.  You had a father: suppose this tale were about  him, and some informant brought it to you, proof in hand: I  am not making too high an estimate of your emotional nature  when I suppose you would regret the circumstance? that you  would feel the tale of frailty the more keenly since it  shamed the author of your days? and that the last thing you  would do would be to publish it in the religious press?   Well, the man who tried to do what Damien did, is my father,  and the father of the man in the Apia bar, and the father of  all who love goodness; and he was your father too, if God had  given you grace to see it.</p>

<p>THE PENTLAND RISING CHAPTER I - THE CAUSES OF THE REVOLT</p>
<p>&#x27;Halt, passenger; take heed what thou dost see, This tomb doth show for what some men did die.&#x27; MONUMENT, GREYFRIARS&#x27; CHURCHYARD, EDINBURGH, 1661-1668. (1)</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago a tragedy was enacted in Scotland, the  memory whereof has been in great measure lost or obscured by  the deep tragedies which followed it.  It is, as it were, the  evening of the night of persecution - a sort of twilight,  dark indeed to us, but light as the noonday when compared  with the midnight gloom which followed.  This fact, of its  being the very threshold of persecution, lends it, however,  an additional interest.</p>
<p>The prejudices of the people against Episcopacy were &#x27;out of  measure increased,&#x27; says Bishop Burnet, &#x27;by the new  incumbents who were put in the places of the ejected  preachers, and were generally very mean and despicable in all  respects.  They were the worst preachers I ever heard; they  were ignorant to a reproach; and many of them were openly  vicious.  They . . . were indeed the dreg and refuse of the  northern parts.  Those of them who arose above contempt or  scandal were men of such violent tempers that they were as  much hated as the others were despised.&#x27; (2)  It was little  to be wondered at, from this account that the country-folk  refused to go to the parish church, and chose rather to  listen to outed ministers in the fields.  But this was not to  be allowed, and their persecutors at last fell on the method  of calling a roll of the parishioners&#x27; names every Sabbath,  and marking a fine of twenty shillings Scots to the name of  each absenter.  In this way very large debts were incurred by  persons altogether unable to pay.  Besides this, landlords  were fined for their tenants&#x27; absences, tenants for their  landlords&#x27;, masters for their servants&#x27;, servants for their  masters&#x27;, even though they themselves were perfectly regular  in their attendance.  And as the curates were allowed to fine  with the sanction of any common soldier, it may be imagined  that often the pretexts were neither very sufficient nor well  proven.</p>
<p>When the fines could not be paid at once, Bibles, clothes,  and household utensils were seized upon, or a number of  soldiers, proportionate to his wealth, were quartered on the  offender.  The coarse and drunken privates filled the houses  with woe; snatched the bread from the children to feed their  dogs; shocked the principles, scorned the scruples, and  blasphemed the religion of their humble hosts; and when they  had reduced them to destitution, sold the furniture, and  burned down the roof-tree which was consecrated to the  peasants by the name of Home.  For all this attention each of  these soldiers received from his unwilling landlord a certain  sum of money per day - three shillings sterling, according to  NAPHTALI.  And frequently they were forced to pay quartering  money for more men than were in reality &#x27;cessed on them.&#x27;  At  that time it was no strange thing to behold a strong man  begging for money to pay his fines, and many others who were  deep in arrears, or who had attracted attention in some other  way, were forced to flee from their homes, and take refuge  from arrest and imprisonment among the wild mosses of the  uplands. (3)</p>
<p>One example in particular we may cite:</p>
<p>John Neilson, the Laird of Corsack, a worthy man, was,  unfortunately for himself, a Nonconformist.  First he was  fined in four hundred pounds Scots, and then through cessing  he lost nineteen hundred and ninety-three pounds Scots.  He  was next obliged to leave his house and flee from place to  place, during which wanderings he lost his horse.  His wife  and children were turned out of doors, and then his tenants  were fined till they too were almost ruined.  As a final  stroke, they drove away all his cattle to Glasgow and sold  them. (4)  Surely it was time that something were done to  alleviate so much sorrow, to overthrow such tyranny.</p>
<p>About this time too there arrived in Galloway a person  calling himself Captain Andrew Gray, and advising the people  to revolt.  He displayed some documents purporting to be from  the northern Covenanters, and stating that they were prepared  to join in any enterprise commenced by their southern  brethren.  The leader of the persecutors was Sir James  Turner, an officer afterwards degraded for his share in the  matter.  &#x27;He was naturally fierce, but was mad when he was  drunk, and that was very often,&#x27; said Bishop Burnet.  &#x27;He was  a learned man, but had always been in armies, and knew no  other rule but to obey orders.  He told me he had no regard  to any law, but acted, as he was commanded, in a military  way.&#x27; (5)</p>
<p>This was the state of matters, when an outrage was committed  which gave spirit and determination to the oppressed  countrymen, lit the flame of insubordination, and for the  time at least recoiled on those who perpetrated it with  redoubled force.</p>

<p>T. JACKSON, 1651 (1)</p>
<p>UPON Tuesday, November 13th, 1666, Corporal George Deanes and  three other soldiers set upon an old man in the clachan of  Dalry and demanded the payment of his fines.  On the old  man&#x27;s refusing to pay, they forced a large party of his  neighbours to go with them and thresh his corn.  The field  was a certain distance out of the clachan, and four persons,  disguised as countrymen, who had been out on the moors all  night, met this mournful drove of slaves, compelled by the  four soldiers to work for the ruin of their friend.  However,  chided to the bone by their night on the hills, and worn out  by want of food, they proceeded to the village inn to refresh  themselves.  Suddenly some people rushed into the room where  they were sitting, and told them that the soldiers were about  to roast the old man, naked, on his own girdle.  This was too  much for them to stand, and they repaired immediately to the  scene of this gross outrage, and at first merely requested  that the captive should be released.  On the refusal of the  two soldiers who were in the front room, high words were  given and taken on both sides, and the other two rushed forth  from an adjoining chamber and made at the countrymen with  drawn swords.  One of the latter, John M&#x27;Lellan of Barscob,  drew a pistol and shot the corporal in the body.  The pieces  of tobacco-pipe with which it was loaded, to the number of  ten at least, entered him, and he was so much disturbed that  he never appears to have recovered, for we find long  afterwards a petition to the Privy Council requesting a  pension for him.  The other soldiers then laid down their  arms, the old man was rescued, and the rebellion was  commenced. (2)</p>
<p>And now we must turn to Sir James Turner&#x27;s memoirs of  himself; for, strange to say, this extraordinary man was  remarkably fond of literary composition, and wrote, besides  the amusing account of his own adventures just mentioned, a  large number of essays and short biographies, and a work on  war, entitled PALLAS ARMATA.  The following are some of the  shorter pieces &#x27;Magick,&#x27; &#x27;Friendship,&#x27; &#x27;Imprisonment,&#x27;  &#x27;Anger,&#x27; &#x27;Revenge,&#x27; &#x27;Duells,&#x27; &#x27;Cruelty,&#x27; &#x27;A Defence of some  of the Ceremonies of the English Liturgie - to wit - Bowing  at the Name of Jesus, The frequent repetition of the Lord&#x27;s  Prayer and Good Lord deliver us, Of the Doxologie, Of  Surplesses, Rotchets, Canonnicall Coats,&#x27; etc.  From what we  know of his character we should expect &#x27;Anger&#x27; and &#x27;Cruelty&#x27;  to be very full and instructive.  But what earthly right he  had to meddle with ecclesiastical subjects it is hard to see.</p>
<p>Upon the 12th of the month he had received some information  concerning Gray&#x27;s proceedings, but as it was excessively  indefinite in its character, he paid no attention to it.  On  the evening of the 14th, Corporal Deanes was brought into  Dumfries, who affirmed stoutly that he had been shot while  refusing to sign the Covenant - a story rendered singularly  unlikely by the after conduct of the rebels.  Sir James  instantly dispatched orders to the cessed soldiers either to  come to Dumfries or meet him on the way to Dalry, and  commanded the thirteen or fourteen men in the town with him  to come at nine next morning to his lodging for supplies.</p>
<p>On the morning of Thursday the rebels arrived at Dumfries  with 50 horse and 150 foot.  Neilson of Corsack, and Gray,  who commanded, with a considerable troop, entered the town,  and surrounded Sir James Turner&#x27;s lodging.  Though it was  between eight and nine o&#x27;clock, that worthy, being unwell,  was still in bed, but rose at once and went to the window.</p>
<p>Neilson and some others cried, &#x27;You may have fair quarter.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I need no quarter,&#x27; replied Sir James; &#x27;nor can I be a  prisoner, seeing there is no war declared.&#x27;  On being told,  however, that he must either be a prisoner or die, he came  down, and went into the street in his night-shirt.  Here Gray  showed himself very desirous of killing him, but he was  overruled by Corsack.  However, he was taken away a prisoner,  Captain Gray mounting him on his own horse, though, as Turner  naively remarks, &#x27;there was good reason for it, for he  mounted himself on a farre better one of mine.&#x27;  A large  coffer containing his clothes and money, together with all  his papers, were taken away by the rebels.  They robbed  Master Chalmers, the Episcopalian minister of Dumfries, of  his horse, drank the King&#x27;s health at the market cross, and  then left Dumfries. (3)</p>

<p>THE PENTLAND RISING  CHAPTER III - THE MARCH OF THE REBELS</p>
<p>&#x27;Stay, passenger, take notice what thou reads, At Edinburgh lie our bodies, here our heads; Our right hands stood at Lanark, these we want, Because with them we signed the Covenant.&#x27; EPITAPH ON A TOMBSTONE AT HAMILTON. (1)</p>
<p>ON Friday the 16th, Bailie Irvine of Dumfries came to the  Council at Edinburgh, and gave information concerning this  &#x27;horrid rebellion.&#x27;  In the absence of Rothes, Sharpe  presided - much to the wrath of some members; and as he  imagined his own safety endangered, his measures were most  energetic.  Dalzell was ordered away to the West, the guards  round the city were doubled, officers and soldiers were  forced to take the oath of allegiance, and all lodgers were  commanded to give in their names.  Sharpe, surrounded with  all these guards and precautions, trembled - trembled as he  trembled when the avengers of blood drew him from his chariot  on Magus Muir, - for he knew how he had sold his trust, how  he had betrayed his charge, and he felt that against him must  their chiefest hatred be directed, against him their direst  thunder-bolts be forged.  But even in his fear the apostate  Presbyterian was unrelenting, unpityingly harsh; he published  in his manifesto no promise of pardon, no inducement to  submission.  He said, &#x27;If you submit not you must die,&#x27; but  never added, &#x27;If you submit you may live!&#x27; (2)</p>
<p>Meantime the insurgents proceeded on their way.  At  Carsphairn they were deserted by Captain Gray, who, doubtless  in a fit of oblivion, neglected to leave behind him the  coffer containing Sir James&#x27;s money.  Who he was is a  mystery, unsolved by any historian; his papers were evidently  forgeries - that, and his final flight, appear to indicate  that he was an agent of the Royalists, for either the King or  the Duke of York was heard to say, &#x27;That, if he might have  his wish, he would have them all turn rebels and go to arms.&#x27;  (3)</p>
<p>Upon the 18th day of the month they left Carsphairn and  marched onwards.</p>
<p>Turner was always lodged by his captors at a good inn,  frequently at the best of which their halting-place could  boast.  Here many visits were paid to him by the ministers  and officers of the insurgent force.  In his description of  these interviews he displays a vein of satiric severity,  admitting any kindness that was done to him with some  qualifying souvenir of former harshness, and gloating over  any injury, mistake, or folly, which it was his chance to  suffer or to hear.  He appears, notwithstanding all this, to  have been on pretty good terms with his cruel &#x27;phanaticks,&#x27;  as the following extract sufficiently proves:</p>
<p>&#x27;Most of the foot were lodged about the church or churchyard,  and order given to ring bells next morning for a sermon to be  preached by Mr. Welch.  Maxwell of Morith, and Major  M&#x27;Cullough invited me to heare &quot;that phanatick sermon&quot; (for  soe they merrilie called it).  They said that preaching might  prove an effectual meane to turne me, which they heartilie  wished.  I answered to them that I was under guards, and that  if they intended to heare that sermon, it was probable I  might likewise, for it was not like my guards wold goe to  church and leave me alone at my lodgeings.  Bot to what they  said of my conversion, I said it wold be hard to turne a  Turner.  Bot because I founde them in a merrie humour, I  said, if I did not come to heare Mr. Welch preach, then they  might fine me in fortie shillings Scots, which was double the  suome of what I had exacted from the phanatics.&#x27; (4)</p>
<p>This took place at Ochiltree, on the 22nd day of the month.   The following is recounted by this personage with malicious  glee, and certainly, if authentic, it is a sad proof of how  chaff is mixed with wheat, and how ignorant, almost impious,  persons were engaged in this movement; nevertheless we give  it, for we wish to present with impartiality all the alleged  facts to the reader:</p>
<p>&#x27;Towards the evening Mr. Robinsone and Mr. Crukshank gaue me  a visite; I called for some ale purposelie to heare one of  them blesse it.  It fell Mr. Robinsone to seeke the blessing,  who said one of the most bombastick graces that ever I heard  in my life.  He summoned God Allmightie very imperiouslie to  be their secondarie (for that was his language).  &quot;And if,&quot;  said he, &quot;thou wilt not be our Secondarie, we will not fight  for thee at all, for it is not our cause bot thy cause; and  if thou wilt not fight for our cause and thy oune cause, then  we are not obliged to fight for it.  They say,&quot; said he,  &quot;that Dukes, Earles, and Lords are coming with the King&#x27;s  General against us, bot they shall be nothing bot a threshing  to us.&quot;  This grace did more fullie satisfie me of the folly  and injustice of their cause, then the ale did quench my  thirst.&#x27; (5)</p>
<p>Frequently the rebels made a halt near some roadside  alehouse, or in some convenient park, where Colonel Wallace,  who had now taken the command, would review the horse and  foot, during which time Turner was sent either into the  alehouse or round the shoulder of the hill, to prevent him  from seeing the disorders which were likely to arise.  He  was, at last, on the 25th day of the month, between Douglas  and Lanark, permitted to behold their evolutions.  &#x27;I found  their horse did consist of four hundreth and fortie, and the  foot of five hundreth and upwards. . . . The horsemen were  armed for most part with suord and pistoll, some onlie with  suord.  The foot with musket, pike, sith (scythe), forke, and  suord; and some with suords great and long.&#x27;  He admired much  the proficiency of their cavalry, and marvelled how they had  attained to it in so short a time. (6)</p>
<p>At Douglas, which they had just left on the morning of this  great wapinshaw, they were charged - awful picture of  depravity! - with the theft of a silver spoon and a  nightgown.  Could it be expected that while the whole country  swarmed with robbers of every description, such a rare  opportunity for plunder should be lost by rogues - that among  a thousand men, even though fighting for religion, there  should not be one Achan in the camp?  At Lanark a declaration  was drawn up and signed by the chief rebels.  In it occurs  the following:</p>
<p>&#x27;The just sense whereof &#x27; - the sufferings of the country -  &#x27;made us choose, rather to betake ourselves to the fields for  self-defence, than to stay at home, burdened daily with the  calamities of others, and tortured with the fears of our own  approaching misery.&#x27; (7)</p>
<p>The whole body, too, swore the Covenant, to which ceremony  the epitaph at the head of this chapter seems to refer.</p>
<p>A report that Dalzell was approaching drove them from Lanark  to Bathgate, where, on the evening of Monday the 26th, the  wearied army stopped.  But at twelve o&#x27;clock the cry, which  served them for a trumpet, of &#x27;Horse! horse!&#x27; and &#x27;Mount the  prisoner!&#x27; resounded through the night-shrouded town, and  called the peasants from their well-earned rest to toil  onwards in their march.  The wind howled fiercely over the  moorland; a close, thick, wetting rain descended.  Chilled to  the bone, worn out with long fatigue, sinking to the knees in  mire, onward they marched to destruction.  One by one the  weary peasants fell off from their ranks to sleep, and die in  the rain-soaked moor, or to seek some house by the wayside  wherein to hide till daybreak.  One by one at first, then in  gradually increasing numbers, at every shelter that was seen,  whole troops left the waning squadrons, and rushed to hide  themselves from the ferocity of the tempest.  To right and  left nought could be descried but the broad expanse of the  moor, and the figures of their fellow-rebels, seen dimly  through the murky night, plodding onwards through the sinking  moss.  Those who kept together - a miserable few - often  halted to rest themselves, and to allow their lagging  comrades to overtake them.  Then onward they went again,  still hoping for assistance, reinforcement, and supplies;  onward again, through the wind, and the rain, and the  darkness - onward to their defeat at Pentland, and their  scaffold at Edinburgh.  It was calculated that they lost one  half of their army on that disastrous night-march.</p>
<p>Next night they reached the village of Colinton, four miles  from Edinburgh, where they halted for the last time. (8)</p>

<p>THE PENTLAND RISING  CHAPTER IV - RULLION GREEN</p>
<p>&#x27;From Covenanters with uplifted hands, From Remonstrators with associate bands, Good Lord, deliver us!&#x27; ROYALIST RHYME, KIRKTON, p. 127.</p>
<p>LATE on the fourth night of November, exactly twenty-four  days before Rullion Green, Richard and George Chaplain,  merchants in Haddington, beheld four men, clad like West- country Whigamores, standing round some object on the ground.   It was at the two-mile cross, and within that distance from  their homes.  At last, to their horror, they discovered that  the recumbent figure was a livid corpse, swathed in a blood- stained winding-sheet. (1)  Many thought that this apparition  was a portent of the deaths connected with the Pentland  Rising.</p>
<p>On the morning of Wednesday, the 28th of November 1666, they  left Colinton and marched to Rullion Green.  There they  arrived about sunset.  The position was a strong one.  On the  summit of a bare, heathery spur of the Pentlands are two  hillocks, and between them lies a narrow band of flat marshy  ground.  On the highest of the two mounds - that nearest the  Pentlands, and on the left hand of the main body - was the  greater part of the cavalry, under Major Learmont; on the  other Barscob and the Galloway gentlemen; and in the centre  Colonel Wallace and the weak, half-armed infantry.  Their  position was further strengthened by the depth of the valley  below, and the deep chasm-like course of the Rullion Burn.</p>
<p>The sun, going down behind the Pentlands, cast golden lights  and blue shadows on their snow-clad summits, slanted  obliquely into the rich plain before them, bathing with rosy  splendour the leafless, snow-sprinkled trees, and fading  gradually into shadow in the distance.  To the south, too,  they beheld a deep-shaded amphitheatre of heather and  bracken; the course of the Esk, near Penicuik, winding about  at the foot of its gorge; the broad, brown expanse of Maw  Moss; and, fading into blue indistinctness in the south, the  wild heath-clad Peeblesshire hills.  In sooth, that scene was  fair, and many a yearning glance was cast over that peaceful  evening scene from the spot where the rebels awaited their  defeat; and when the fight was over, many a noble fellow  lifted his head from the blood-stained heather to strive with  darkening eyeballs to behold that landscape, over which, as  over his life and his cause, the shadows of night and of  gloom were falling and thickening.</p>
<p>It was while waiting on this spot that the fear-inspiring cry  was raised: &#x27;The enemy!  Here come the enemy!&#x27;</p>
<p>Unwilling to believe their own doom - for our insurgents  still hoped for success in some negotiations for peace which  had been carried on at Colinton - they called out, &#x27;They are  some of our own.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;They are too blacke &#x27; (I.E. numerous), &#x27;fie! fie! for ground  to draw up on,&#x27; cried Wallace, fully realising the want of  space for his men, and proving that it was not till after  this time that his forces were finally arranged. (2)</p>
<p>First of all the battle was commenced by fifty Royalist horse  sent obliquely across the hill to attack the left wing of the  rebels.  An equal number of Learmont&#x27;s men met them, and,  after a struggle, drove them back.  The course of the Rullion  Burn prevented almost all pursuit, and Wallace, on perceiving  it, dispatched a body of foot to occupy both the burn and  some ruined sheep-walls on the farther side.</p>
<p>Dalzell changed his position, and drew up his army at the  foot of the hill, on the top of which were his foes.  He then  dispatched a mingled body of infantry and cavalry to attack  Wallace&#x27;s outpost, but they also were driven back.  A third  charge produced a still more disastrous effect, for Dalzell  had to check the pursuit of his men by a reinforcement.</p>
<p>These repeated checks bred a panic in the Lieutenant- General&#x27;s ranks, for several of his men flung down their  arms.  Urged by such fatal symptoms, and by the approaching  night, he deployed his men, and closed in overwhelming  numbers on the centre and right flank of the insurgent army.   In the increasing twilight the burning matches of the  firelocks, shimmering on barrel, halbert, and cuirass, lent  to the approaching army a picturesque effect, like a huge,  many-armed giant breathing flame into the darkness.</p>
<p>Placed on an overhanging hill, Welch and Semple cried aloud,  &#x27;The God of Jacob! The God of Jacob!&#x27; and prayed with  uplifted hands for victory. (3)</p>
<p>But still the Royalist troops closed in.</p>
<p>Captain John Paton was observed by Dalzell, who determined to  capture him with his own hands.  Accordingly he charged  forward, presenting his pistols.  Paton fired, but the balls  hopped off Dalzell&#x27;s buff coat and fell into his boot.  With  the superstition peculiar to his age, the Nonconformist  concluded that his adversary was rendered bullet-proof by  enchantment, and, pulling some small silver coins from his  pocket, charged his pistol therewith.  Dalzell, seeing this,  and supposing, it is likely, that Paton was putting in larger  balls, hid behind his servant, who was killed. (4)</p>
<p>Meantime the outposts were forced, and the army of Wallace  was enveloped in the embrace of a hideous boa-constrictor -  tightening, closing, crushing every semblance of life from  the victim enclosed in his toils.  The flanking parties of  horse were forced in upon the centre, and though, as even  Turner grants, they fought with desperation, a general flight  was the result.</p>
<p>But when they fell there was none to sing their coronach or  wail the death-wail over them.  Those who sacrificed  themselves for the peace, the liberty, and the religion of  their fellow-countrymen, lay bleaching in the field of death  for long, and when at last they were buried by charity, the  peasants dug up their bodies, desecrated their graves, and  cast them once more upon the open heath for the sorry value  of their winding-sheets!</p>
<p>INSCRIPTION ON STONE AT RULLION GREEN:</p>
<p>HERE AND NEAR TO THIS PLACE LYES THE REVEREND MR JOHN CROOKSHANK AND MR ANDREW MCCORMICK MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL AND ABOUT FIFTY OTHER TRUE COVENANTED PRESBYTERIANS WHO WERE KILLED IN THIS PLACE IN THEIR OWN INOCENT SELF DEFENCE AND DEFFENCE OF THE COVENANTED WORK OF REFORMATION BY THOMAS DALZEEL OF BINS UPON THE 28 OF NOVEMBER 1666.  REV. 12. 11. ERECTED SEPT. 28 1738.</p>
<p>BACK OF STONE:</p>
<p>A Cloud of Witnesses lyes here, Who for Christ&#x27;s Interest did appear, For to restore true Liberty, O&#x27;erturned then by tyranny. And by proud Prelats who did Rage Against the Lord&#x27;s Own heritage. They sacrificed were for the laws Of Christ their king, his noble cause. These heroes fought with great renown; By falling got the Martyr&#x27;s crown. (5)</p>

<p>THE PENTLAND RISING  CHAPTER V - A RECORD OF BLOOD</p>
<p>&#x27;They cut his hands ere he was dead, And after that struck of his head. His blood under the altar cries For vengeance on Christ&#x27;s enemies.&#x27; EPITAPH ON TOMB AT LONGCROSS OF CLERMONT. (1)</p>
<p>MASTER ANDREW MURRAY, an outed minister, residing in the  Potterrow, on the morning after the defeat, heard the sounds  of cheering and the march of many feet beneath his window.   He gazed out.  With colours flying, and with music sounding,  Dalzell, victorious, entered Edinburgh.  But his banners were  dyed in blood, and a band of prisoners were marched within  his ranks.  The old man knew it all.  That martial and  triumphant strain was the death-knell of his friends and of  their cause, the rust-hued spots upon the flags were the  tokens of their courage and their death, and the prisoners  were the miserable remnant spared from death in battle to die  upon the scaffold.  Poor old man! he had outlived all joy.   Had he lived longer he would have seen increasing torment and  increasing woe; he would have seen the clouds, then but  gathering in mist, cast a more than midnight darkness over  his native hills, and have fallen a victim to those bloody  persecutions which, later, sent their red memorials to the  sea by many a burn.  By a merciful Providence all this was  spared to him - he fell beneath the first blow; and ere four  days had passed since Rullion Green, the aged minister of God  was gathered to is fathers. (2)</p>
<p>When Sharpe first heard of the rebellion, he applied to Sir  Alexander Ramsay, the Provost, for soldiers to guard his  house.  Disliking their occupation, the soldiers gave him an  ugly time of it.  All the night through they kept up a  continuous series of &#x27;alarms and incursions,&#x27; &#x27;cries of  &quot;Stand!&quot; &quot;Give fire!&quot;&#x27; etc., which forced the prelate to flee  to the Castle in the morning, hoping there to find the rest  which was denied him at home. (3)  Now, however, when all  danger to himself was past, Sharpe came out in his true  colours, and scant was the justice likely to be shown to the  foes of Scottish Episcopacy when the Primate was by.  The  prisoners were lodged in Haddo&#x27;s Hole, a part of St. Giles&#x27;  Cathedral, where, by the kindness of Bishop Wishart, to his  credit be it spoken, they were amply supplied with food. (4)</p>
<p>Some people urged, in the Council, that the promise of  quarter which had been given on the field of battle should  protect the lives of the miserable men.  Sir John Gilmoure,  the greatest lawyer, gave no opinion - certainly a suggestive  circumstance - but Lord Lee declared that this would not  interfere with their legal trial, &#x27;so to bloody executions  they went.&#x27; (5)  To the number of thirty they were condemned  and executed; while two of them, Hugh M&#x27;Kail, a young  minister, and Neilson of Corsack, were tortured with the  boots.</p>
<p>The goods of those who perished were confiscated, and their  bodies were dismembered and distributed to different parts of  the country; &#x27;the heads of Major M&#x27;Culloch and the two  Gordons,&#x27; it was resolved, says Kirkton, &#x27;should be pitched  on the gate of Kirkcudbright; the two Hamiltons and Strong&#x27;s  head should be affixed at Hamilton, and Captain Arnot&#x27;s sett  on the Watter Gate at Edinburgh.  The armes of all the ten,  because they hade with uplifted hands renewed the Covenant at  Lanark, were sent to the people of that town to expiate that  crime, by placing these arms on the top of the prison.&#x27; (6)   Among these was John Neilson, the Laird of Corsack, who saved  Turner&#x27;s life at Dumfries; in return for which service Sir  James attempted, though without success, to get the poor man  reprieved.  One of the condemned died of his wounds between  the day of condemnation and the day of execution.  &#x27; None of  them,&#x27; says Kirkton, &#x27;would save their life by taking the  declaration and renouncing the Covenant, though it was  offered to them. . . . But never men died in Scotland so much  lamented by the people, not only spectators, but those in the  country.  When Knockbreck and his brother were turned over,  they clasped each other in their armes, and so endured the  pangs of death.  When Humphrey Colquhoun died, he spoke not  like an ordinary citizen, but like a heavenly minister,  relating his comfortable Christian experiences, and called  for his Bible, and laid it on his wounded arm, and read John  iii. 8, and spoke upon it to the admiration of all.  But most  of all, when Mr. M&#x27;Kail died, there was such a lamentation as  was never known in Scotland before; not one dry cheek upon  all the street, or in all the numberless windows in the  mercate place.&#x27; (7)</p>
<p>The following passage from this speech speaks for itself and  its author:</p>
<p>&#x27;Hereafter I will not talk with flesh and blood, nor think on  the world&#x27;s consolations.  Farewell to all my friends, whose  company hath been refreshful to me in my pilgrimage.  I have  done with the light of the sun and the moon; welcome eternal  light, eternal life, everlasting love, everlasting praise,  everlasting glory.  Praise to Him that sits upon the throne,  and to the Lamb for ever!  Bless the Lord, O my soul, that  hath pardoned all my iniquities in the blood of His Son, and  healed all my diseases.  Bless Him, O all ye His angels that  excel in strength, ye ministers of His that do His pleasure.   Bless the Lord, O my soul!&#x27; (8)</p>
<p>After having ascended the gallows ladder he again broke forth  in the following words of touching eloquence: &#x27;And now I  leave off to speak any more to creatures, and begin my  intercourse with God, which shall never be broken off.   Farewell father and mother, friends and relations!  Farewell  the world and all delights!  Farewell meat and drink!   Farewell sun, moon, and stars! - Welcome God and Father!   Welcome sweet Jesus Christ, the Mediator of the new covenant!   Welcome blessed Spirit of grace and God of all consolation!   Welcome glory!  Welcome eternal life!  Welcome Death!&#x27; (9)</p>
<p>At Glasgow, too, where some were executed, they caused the  soldiers to beat the drums and blow the trumpets on their  closing ears.  Hideous refinement of revenge!  Even the last  words which drop from the lips of a dying man - words surely  the most sincere and the most unbiassed which mortal mouth  can utter - even these were looked upon as poisoned and as  poisonous.  &#x27;Drown their last accents,&#x27; was the cry, &#x27;lest  they should lead the crowd to take their part, or at the  least to mourn their doom!&#x27; (10)  But, after all, perhaps it  was more merciful than one would think -unintentionally so,  of course; perhaps the storm of harsh and fiercely jubilant  noises, the clanging of trumpets, the rattling of drums, and  the hootings and jeerings of an unfeeling mob, which were the  last they heard on earth, might, when the mortal fight was  over, when the river of death was passed, add tenfold  sweetness to the hymning of the angels, tenfold peacefulness  to the shores which they had reached.</p>
<p>Not content with the cruelty of these executions, some even  of the peasantry, though these were confined to the shire of  Mid-Lothian, pursued, captured, plundered, and murdered the  miserable fugitives who fell in their way.  One strange story  have we of these times of blood and persecution: Kirkton the  historian and popular tradition tell us alike of a flame  which often would arise from the grave, in a moss near  Carnwath, of some of those poor rebels: of how it crept along  the ground; of how it covered the house of their murderer;  and of how it scared him with its lurid glare.</p>
<p>Hear Daniel Defoe: (11)</p>
<p>&#x27;If the poor people were by these insupportable violences  made desperate, and driven to all the extremities of a wild  despair, who can justly reflect on them when they read in the  Word of God &quot;That oppression makes a wise man mad&quot;?  And  therefore were there no other original of the insurrection  known by the name of the Rising of Pentland, it was nothing  but what the intolerable oppressions of those times might  have justified to all the world, nature having dictated to  all people a right of defence when illegally and arbitrarily  attacked in a manner not justifiable either by laws of  nature, the laws of God, or the laws of the country.&#x27;</p>
<p>Bear this remonstrance of Defoe&#x27;s in mind, and though it is  the fashion of the day to jeer and to mock, to execrate and  to contemn, the noble band of Covenanters - though the bitter  laugh at their old-world religious views, the curl of the lip  at their merits, and the chilling silence on their bravery  and their determination, are but too rife through all society  - be charitable to what was evil and honest to what was good  about the Pentland insurgents, who fought for life and  liberty, for country and religion, on the 28th of November  1666, now just two hundred years ago.</p>

<p>THE DAY AFTER TO-MORROW</p>
<p>HISTORY is much decried; it is a tissue of errors, we are  told, no doubt correctly; and rival historians expose each  other&#x27;s blunders with gratification.  Yet the worst historian  has a clearer view of the period he studies than the best of  us can hope to form of that in which we live.  The obscurest  epoch is to-day; and that for a thousand reasons of inchoate  tendency, conflicting report, and sheer mass and multiplicity  of experience; but chiefly, perhaps, by reason of an  insidious shifting of landmarks.  Parties and ideas  continually move, but not by measurable marches on a stable  course; the political soil itself steals forth by  imperceptible degrees, like a travelling glacier, carrying on  its bosom not only political parties but their flag-posts and  cantonments; so that what appears to be an eternal city  founded on hills is but a flying island of Laputa.  It is for  this reason in particular that we are all becoming Socialists  without knowing it; by which I would not in the least refer  to the acute case of Mr. Hyndman and his horn-blowing  supporters, sounding their trumps of a Sunday within the  walls of our individualist Jericho - but to the stealthy  change that has come over the spirit of Englishmen and  English legislation.  A little while ago, and we were still  for liberty; &#x27;crowd a few more thousands on the bench of  Government,&#x27; we seemed to cry; &#x27;keep her head direct on  liberty, and we cannot help but come to port.&#x27;  This is over;  LAISSER FAIRE declines in favour; our legislation grows  authoritative, grows philanthropical, bristles with new  duties and new penalties, and casts a spawn of inspectors,  who now begin, note-book in hand, to darken the face of  England.  It may be right or wrong, we are not trying that;  but one thing it is beyond doubt: it is Socialism in action,  and the strange thing is that we scarcely know it.</p>
<p>Liberty has served us a long while, and it may be time to  seek new altars.  Like all other principles, she has been  proved to be self-exclusive in the long run.  She has taken  wages besides (like all other virtues) and dutifully served  Mammon; so that many things we were accustomed to admire as  the benefits of freedom and common to all were truly benefits  of wealth, and took their value from our neighbours&#x27; poverty.   A few shocks of logic, a few disclosures (in the journalistic  phrase) of what the freedom of manufacturers, landlords, or  shipowners may imply for operatives, tenants, or seamen, and  we not unnaturally begin to turn to that other pole of hope,  beneficent tyranny.  Freedom, to be desirable, involves  kindness, wisdom, and all the virtues of the free; but the  free man as we have seen him in action has been, as of yore,  only the master of many helots; and the slaves are still ill- fed, ill-clad, ill-taught, ill-housed, insolently treated,  and driven to their mines and workshops by the lash of  famine.  So much, in other men&#x27;s affairs, we have begun to  see clearly; we have begun to despair of virtue in these  other men, and from our seat in Parliament begin to discharge  upon them, thick as arrows, the host of our inspectors.  The  landlord has long shaken his head over the manufacturer;  those who do business on land have lost all trust in the  virtues of the shipowner; the professions look askance upon  the retail traders and have even started their co-operative  stores to ruin them; and from out the smoke-wreaths of  Birmingham a finger has begun to write upon the wall the  condemnation of the landlord.  Thus, piece by piece, do we  condemn each other, and yet not perceive the conclusion, that  our whole estate is somewhat damnable.  Thus, piece by piece,  each acting against his neighbour, each sawing away the  branch on which some other interest is seated, do we apply in  detail our Socialistic remedies, and yet not perceive that we  are all labouring together to bring in Socialism at large.  A  tendency so stupid and so selfish is like to prove  invincible; and if Socialism be at all a practicable rule of  life, there is every chance that our grand-children will see  the day and taste the pleasures of existence in something far  liker an ant-heap than any previous human polity.  And this  not in the least because of the voice of Mr. Hyndman or the  horns of his followers; but by the mere glacier movement of  the political soil, bearing forward on its bosom, apparently  undisturbed, the proud camps of Whig and Tory.  If Mr.  Hyndman were a man of keen humour, which is far from my  conception of his character, he might rest from his troubling  and look on: the walls of Jericho begin already to crumble  and dissolve.  That great servile war, the Armageddon of  money and numbers, to which we looked forward when young,  becomes more and more unlikely; and we may rather look to see  a peaceable and blindfold evolution, the work of dull men  immersed in political tactics and dead to political results.</p>
<p>The principal scene of this comedy lies, of course, in the  House of Commons; it is there, besides, that the details of  this new evolution (if it proceed) will fall to be decided;  so that the state of Parliament is not only diagnostic of the  present but fatefully prophetic of the future.  Well, we all  know what Parliament is, and we are all ashamed of it.  We  may pardon it some faults, indeed, on the ground of Irish  obstruction - a bitter trial, which it supports with notable  good humour.  But the excuse is merely local; it cannot apply  to similar bodies in America and France; and what are we to  say of these?  President Cleveland&#x27;s letter may serve as a  picture of the one; a glance at almost any paper will  convince us of the weakness of the other.  Decay appears to  have seized on the organ of popular government in every land;  and this just at the moment when we begin to bring to it, as  to an oracle of justice, the whole skein of our private  affairs to be unravelled, and ask it, like a new Messiah, to  take upon itself our frailties and play for us the part that  should be played by our own virtues.  For that, in few words,  is the case.  We cannot trust ourselves to behave with  decency; we cannot trust our consciences; and the remedy  proposed is to elect a round number of our neighbours, pretty  much at random, and say to these: &#x27;Be ye our conscience; make  laws so wise, and continue from year to year to administer  them so wisely, that they shall save us from ourselves and  make us righteous and happy, world without end.  Amen.&#x27;  And  who can look twice at the British Parliament and then  seriously bring it such a task?  I am not advancing this as  an argument against Socialism: once again, nothing is further  from my mind.  There are great truths in Socialism, or no  one, not even Mr. Hyndman, would be found to hold it; and if  it came, and did one-tenth part of what it offers, I for one  should make it welcome.  But if it is to come, we may as well  have some notion of what it will be like; and the first thing  to grasp is that our new polity will be designed and  administered (to put it courteously) with something short of  inspiration.  It will be made, or will grow, in a human  parliament; and the one thing that will not very hugely  change is human nature.  The Anarchists think otherwise, from  which it is only plain that they have not carried to the  study of history the lamp of human sympathy.</p>
<p>Given, then, our new polity, with its new waggon-load of  laws, what headmarks must we look for in the life?  We chafe  a good deal at that excellent thing, the income-tax, because  it brings into our affairs the prying fingers, and exposes us  to the tart words, of the official.  The official, in all  degrees, is already something of a terror to many of us.  I  would not willingly have to do with even a police-constable  in any other spirit than that of kindness.  I still remember  in my dreams the eye-glass of a certain ATTACHE at a certain  embassy - an eyeglass that was a standing indignity to all on  whom it looked; and my next most disagreeable remembrance is  of a bracing, Republican postman in the city of San  Francisco.  I lived in that city among working folk, and what  my neighbours accepted at the postman&#x27;s hands - nay, what I  took from him myself - it is still distasteful to recall.   The bourgeois, residing in the upper parts of society, has  but few opportunities of tasting this peculiar bowl; but  about the income-tax, as I have said, or perhaps about a  patent, or in the halls of an embassy at the hands of my  friend of the eye-glass, he occasionally sets his lips to it;  and he may thus imagine (if he has that faculty of  imagination, without which most faculties are void) how it  tastes to his poorer neighbours, who must drain it to the  dregs.  In every contact with authority, with their employer,  with the police, with the School Board officer, in the  hospital, or in the workhouse, they have equally the occasion  to appreciate the light-hearted civility of the man in  office; and as an experimentalist in several out-of-the-way  provinces of life, I may say it has but to be felt to be  appreciated.  Well, this golden age of which we are speaking  will be the golden age of officials.  In all our concerns it  will be their beloved duty to meddle, with what tact, with  what obliging words, analogy will aid us to imagine.  It is  likely these gentlemen will be periodically elected; they  will therefore have their turn of being underneath, which  does not always sweeten men&#x27;s conditions.  The laws they will  have to administer will be no clearer than those we know to- day, and the body which is to regulate their administration  no wiser than the British Parliament.  So that upon all hands  we may look for a form of servitude most galling to the blood  - servitude to many and changing masters, and for all the  slights that accompany the rule of jack-in-office.  And if  the Socialistic programme be carried out with the least  fulness, we shall have lost a thing, in most respects not  much to be regretted, but as a moderator of oppression, a  thing nearly invaluable - the newspaper.  For the independent  journal is a creature of capital and competition; it stands  and falls with millionaires and railway bonds and all the  abuses and glories of to-day; and as soon as the State has  fairly taken its bent to authority and philanthropy, and laid  the least touch on private property, the days of the  independent journal are numbered.  State railways may be good  things and so may State bakeries; but a State newspaper will  never be a very trenchant critic of the State officials.</p>
<p>But again, these officials would have no sinecure.  Crime  would perhaps be less, for some of the motives of crime we  may suppose would pass away.  But if Socialism were carried  out with any fulness, there would be more contraventions.  We  see already new sins ringing up like mustard - School Board  sins, factory sins, Merchant Shipping Act sins - none of  which I would be thought to except against in particular, but  all of which, taken together, show us that Socialism can be a  hard master even in the beginning.  If it go on to such  heights as we hear proposed and lauded, if it come actually  to its ideal of the ant-heap, ruled with iron justice, the  number of new contraventions will be out of all proportion  multiplied.  Take the case of work alone.  Man is an idle  animal.  He is at least as intelligent as the ant; but  generations of advisers have in vain recommended him the  ant&#x27;s example.  Of those who are found truly indefatigable in  business, some are misers; some are the practisers of  delightful industries, like gardening; some are students,  artists, inventors, or discoverers, men lured forward by  successive hopes; and the rest are those who live by games of  skill or hazard - financiers, billiard-players, gamblers, and  the like.  But in unloved toils, even under the prick of  necessity, no man is continually sedulous.  Once eliminate  the fear of starvation, once eliminate or bound the hope of  riches, and we shall see plenty of skulking and malingering.   Society will then be something not wholly unlike a cotton  plantation in the old days; with cheerful, careless,  demoralised slaves, with elected overseers, and, instead of  the planter, a chaotic popular assembly.  If the blood be  purposeful and the soil strong, such a plantation may  succeed, and be, indeed, a busy ant-heap, with full granaries  and long hours of leisure.  But even then I think the whip  will be in the overseer&#x27;s hands, and not in vain.  For, when  it comes to be a question of each man doing his own share or  the rest doing more, prettiness of sentiment will be  forgotten.  To dock the skulker&#x27;s food is not enough; many  will rather eat haws and starve on petty pilferings than put  their shoulder to the wheel for one hour daily.  For such as  these, then, the whip will be in the overseer&#x27;s hand; and his  own sense of justice and the superintendence of a chaotic  popular assembly will be the only checks on its employment.   Now, you may be an industrious man and a good citizen, and  yet not love, nor yet be loved by, Dr. Fell the inspector.   It is admitted by private soldiers that the disfavour of a  sergeant is an evil not to be combated; offend the sergeant,  they say, and in a brief while you will either be disgraced  or have deserted.  And the sergeant can no longer appeal to  the lash.  But if these things go on, we shall see, or our  sons shall see, what it is to have offended an inspector.</p>
<p>This for the unfortunate.  But with the fortunate also, even  those whom the inspector loves, it may not be altogether  well.  It is concluded that in such a state of society,  supposing it to be financially sound, the level of comfort  will be high.  It does not follow: there are strange depths  of idleness in man, a too-easily-got sufficiency, as in the  case of the sago-eaters, often quenching the desire for all  besides; and it is possible that the men of the richest ant- heaps may sink even into squalor.  But suppose they do not;  suppose our tricksy instrument of human nature, when we play  upon it this new tune, should respond kindly; suppose no one  to be damped and none exasperated by the new conditions, the  whole enterprise to be financially sound - a vaulting  supposition - and all the inhabitants to dwell together in a  golden mean of comfort: we have yet to ask ourselves if this  be what man desire, or if it be what man will even deign to  accept for a continuance.  It is certain that man loves to  eat, it is not certain that he loves that only or that best.   He is supposed to love comfort; it is not a love, at least,  that he is faithful to.  He is supposed to love happiness; it  is my contention that he rather loves excitement.  Danger,  enterprise, hope, the novel, the aleatory, are dearer to man  than regular meals.  He does not think so when he is hungry,  but he thinks so again as soon as he is fed; and on the  hypothesis of a successful ant-heap, he would never go  hungry.  It would be always after dinner in that society, as,  in the land of the Lotos-eaters, it was always afternoon; and  food, which, when we have it not, seems all-important, drops  in our esteem, as soon as we have it, to a mere prerequisite  of living.</p>
<p>That for which man lives is not the same thing for all  individuals nor in all ages; yet it has a common base; what  he seeks and what he must have is that which will seize and  hold his attention.  Regular meals and weatherproof lodgings  will not do this long.  Play in its wide sense, as the  artificial induction of sensation, including all games and  all arts, will, indeed, go far to keep him conscious of  himself; but in the end he wearies for realities.  Study or  experiment, to some rare natures, is the unbroken pastime of  a life.  These are enviable natures; people shut in the house  by sickness often bitterly envy them; but the commoner man  cannot continue to exist upon such altitudes: his feet itch  for physical adventure; his blood boils for physical dangers,  pleasures, and triumphs; his fancy, the looker after new  things, cannot continue to look for them in books and  crucibles, but must seek them on the breathing stage of life.   Pinches, buffets, the glow of hope, the shock of  disappointment, furious contention with obstacles: these are  the true elixir for all vital spirits, these are what they  seek alike in their romantic enterprises and their unromantic  dissipations.  When they are taken in some pinch closer than  the common, they cry, &#x27;Catch me here again!&#x27; and sure enough  you catch them there again - perhaps before the week is out.   It is as old as ROBINSON CRUSOE; as old as man.  Our race has  not been strained for all these ages through that sieve of  dangers that we call Natural Selection, to sit down with  patience in the tedium of safety; the voices of its fathers  call it forth.  Already in our society as it exists, the  bourgeois is too much cottoned about for any zest in living;  he sits in his parlour out of reach of any danger, often out  of reach of any vicissitude but one of health; and there he  yawns.  If the people in the next villa took pot-shots at  him, he might be killed indeed, but so long as he escaped he  would find his blood oxygenated and his views of the world  brighter.  If Mr. Mallock, on his way to the publishers,  should have his skirts pinned to a wall by a javelin, it  would not occur to him - at least for several hours - to ask  if life were worth living; and if such peril were a daily  matter, he would ask it never more; he would have other  things to think about, he would be living indeed - not lying  in a box with cotton, safe, but immeasurably dull.  The  aleatory, whether it touch life, or fortune, or renown -  whether we explore Africa or only toss for halfpence - that  is what I conceive men to love best, and that is what we are  seeking to exclude from men&#x27;s existences.  Of all forms of  the aleatory, that which most commonly attends our working  men - the danger of misery from want of work - is the least  inspiriting: it does not whip the blood, it does not evoke  the glory of contest; it is tragic, but it is passive; and  yet, in so far as it is aleatory, and a peril sensibly  touching them, it does truly season the men&#x27;s lives.  Of  those who fail, I do not speak - despair should be sacred;  but to those who even modestly succeed, the changes of their  life bring interest: a job found, a shilling saved, a dainty  earned, all these are wells of pleasure springing afresh for  the successful poor; and it is not from these but from the  villa-dweller that we hear complaints of the unworthiness of  life.  Much, then, as the average of the proletariat would  gain in this new state of life, they would also lose a  certain something, which would not be missed in the  beginning, but would be missed progressively and  progressively lamented.  Soon there would be a looking back:  there would be tales of the old world humming in young men&#x27;s  ears, tales of the tramp and the pedlar, and the hopeful  emigrant.  And in the stall-fed life of the successful ant- heap - with its regular meals, regular duties, regular  pleasures, an even course of life, and fear excluded - the  vicissitudes, delights, and havens of to-day will seem of  epic breadth.  This may seem a shallow observation; but the  springs by which men are moved lie much on the surface.   Bread, I believe, has always been considered first, but the  circus comes close upon its heels.  Bread we suppose to be  given amply; the cry for circuses will be the louder, and if  the life of our descendants be such as we have conceived,  there are two beloved pleasures on which they will be likely  to fall back: the pleasures of intrigue and of sedition.</p>
<p>In all this I have supposed the ant-heap to be financially  sound.  I am no economist, only a writer of fiction; but even  as such, I know one thing that bears on the economic question  - I know the imperfection of man&#x27;s faculty for business.  The  Anarchists, who count some rugged elements of common sense  among what seem to me their tragic errors, have said upon  this matter all that I could wish to say, and condemned  beforehand great economical polities.  So far it is obvious  that they are right; they may be right also in predicting a  period of communal independence, and they may even be right  in thinking that desirable.  But the rise of communes is none  the less the end of economic equality, just when we were told  it was beginning.  Communes will not be all equal in extent,  nor in quality of soil, nor in growth of population; nor will  the surplus produce of all be equally marketable.  It will be  the old story of competing interests, only with a new unit;  and, as it appears to me, a new, inevitable danger.  For the  merchant and the manufacturer, in this new world, will be a  sovereign commune; it is a sovereign power that will see its  crops undersold, and its manufactures worsted in the market.   And all the more dangerous that the sovereign power should be  small.  Great powers are slow to stir; national affronts,  even with the aid of newspapers, filter slowly into popular  consciousness; national losses are so unequally shared, that  one part of the population will be counting its gains while  another sits by a cold hearth.  But in the sovereign commune  all will be centralised and sensitive.  When jealousy springs  up, when (let us say) the commune of Poole has overreached  the commune of Dorchester, irritation will run like  quicksilver throughout the body politic; each man in  Dorchester will have to suffer directly in his diet and his  dress; even the secretary, who drafts the official  correspondence, will sit down to his task embittered, as a  man who has dined ill and may expect to dine worse; and thus  a business difference between communes will take on much the  same colour as a dispute between diggers in the lawless West,  and will lead as directly to the arbitrament of blows.  So  that the establishment of the communal system will not only  reintroduce all the injustices and heart-burnings of economic  inequality, but will, in all human likelihood, inaugurate a  world of hedgerow warfare.  Dorchester will march on Poole,  Sherborne on Dorchester, Wimborne on both; the waggons will  be fired on as they follow the highway, the trains wrecked on  the lines, the ploughman will go armed into the field of  tillage; and if we have not a return of ballad literature,  the local press at least will celebrate in a high vein the  victory of Cerne Abbas or the reverse of Toller Porcorum.  At  least this will not be dull; when I was younger, I could have  welcomed such a world with relief; but it is the New-Old with  a vengeance, and irresistibly suggests the growth of military  powers and the foundation of new empires.</p>
<p>COLLEGE PAPERS CHAPTER I - EDINBURGH STUDENTS IN 1824</p>
<p>ON the 2nd of January 1824 was issued the prospectus of the  LAPSUS LINGUAE; OR, THE COLLEGE TATLER; and on the 7th the  first number appeared.  On Friday the 2nd of April &#x27;MR.  TATLER became speechless.&#x27;  Its history was not all one  success; for the editor (who applies to himself the words of  Iago, &#x27;I am nothing if I am not critical&#x27;) overstepped the  bounds of caution, and found himself seriously embroiled with  the powers that were.  There appeared in No. XVI. a most  bitter satire upon Sir John Leslie, in which he was compared  to Falstaff, charged with puffing himself, and very prettily  censured for publishing only the first volume of a class- book, and making all purchasers pay for both.  Sir John  Leslie took up the matter angrily, visited Carfrae the  publisher, and threatened him with an action, till he was  forced to turn the hapless LAPSUS out of doors.  The  maltreated periodical found shelter in the shop of Huie,  Infirmary Street; and No. XVII. was duly issued from the new  office.  No. XVII. beheld MR. TATLER&#x27;S humiliation, in which,  with fulsome apology and not very credible assurances of  respect and admiration, he disclaims the article in question,  and advertises a new issue of No. XVI. with all objectionable  matter omitted.  This, with pleasing euphemism, he terms in a  later advertisement, &#x27;a new and improved edition.&#x27;  This was  the only remarkable adventure of MR. TATLER&#x27;S brief  existence; unless we consider as such a silly Chaldee  manuscript in imitation of BLACKWOOD, and a letter of reproof  from a divinity student on the impiety of the same dull  effusion.  He laments the near approach of his end in  pathetic terms.  &#x27;How shall we summon up sufficient courage,&#x27;  says he, &#x27;to look for the last time on our beloved little  devil and his inestimable proof-sheet?  How shall we be able  to pass No. 14 Infirmary Street and feel that all its  attractions are over?  How shall we bid farewell for ever to  that excellent man, with the long greatcoat, wooden leg and  wooden board, who acts as our representative at the gate of  ALMA MATER?&#x27;  But alas! he had no choice: MR. TATLER, whose  career, he says himself, had been successful, passed  peacefully away, and has ever since dumbly implored &#x27;the  bringing home of bell and burial.&#x27;</p>
<p>ALTER ET IDEM.  A very different affair was the LAPSUS  LINGUAE from the EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE.  The two  prospectuses alone, laid side by side, would indicate the  march of luxury and the repeal of the paper duty.  The penny  bi-weekly broadside of session 1828-4 was almost wholly  dedicated to Momus.  Epigrams, pointless letters, amorous  verses, and University grievances are the continual burthen  of the song.  But MR. TATLER was not without a vein of hearty  humour; and his pages afford what is much better: to wit, a  good picture of student life as it then was.  The students of  those polite days insisted on retaining their hats in the  class-room.  There was a cab-stance in front of the College;  and &#x27;Carriage Entrance&#x27; was posted above the main arch, on  what the writer pleases to call &#x27;coarse, unclassic boards.&#x27;   The benches of the &#x27;Speculative&#x27; then, as now, were red; but  all other Societies (the &#x27;Dialectic&#x27; is the only survivor)  met downstairs, in some rooms of which it is pointedly said  that &#x27;nothing else could conveniently be made of them.&#x27;   However horrible these dungeons may have been, it is certain  that they were paid for, and that far too heavily for the  taste of session 1823-4, which found enough calls upon its  purse for porter and toasted cheese at Ambrose&#x27;s, or  cranberry tarts and ginger-wine at Doull&#x27;s.  Duelling was  still a possibility; so much so that when two medicals fell  to fisticuffs in Adam Square, it was seriously hinted that  single combat would be the result.  Last and most wonderful  of all, Gall and Spurzheim were in every one&#x27;s mouth; and the  Law student, after having exhausted Byron&#x27;s poetry and  Scott&#x27;s novels, informed the ladies of his belief in  phrenology.  In the present day he would dilate on &#x27;Red as a  rose is she,&#x27; and then mention that he attends Old  Greyfriars&#x27;, as a tacit claim to intellectual superiority.  I  do not know that the advance is much.</p>
<p>But MR. TATLER&#x27;S best performances were three short papers in  which he hit off pretty smartly the idiosyncrasies of the  &#x27;DIVINITY,&#x27; the &#x27;MEDICAL,&#x27; and the &#x27;LAW&#x27; of session 1823-4.   The fact that there was no notice of the &#x27;ARTS&#x27; seems to  suggest that they stood in the same intermediate position as  they do now - the epitome of student-kind.  MR. TATLER&#x27;S  satire is, on the whole, good-humoured, and has not grown  superannuated in ALL its limbs.  His descriptions may limp at  some points, but there are certain broad traits that apply  equally well to session 1870-1.  He shows us the DIVINITY of  the period - tall, pale, and slender - his collar greasy, and  his coat bare about the seams - &#x27;his white neckcloth serving  four days, and regularly turned the third&#x27; - &#x27;the rim of his  hat deficient in wool&#x27; - and &#x27;a weighty volume of theology  under his arm.&#x27; He was the man to buy cheap &#x27;a snuff-box, or  a dozen of pencils, or a six-bladed knife, or a quarter of a  hundred quills,&#x27; at any of the public sale-rooms.  He was  noted for cheap purchases, and for exceeding the legal tender  in halfpence.  He haunted &#x27;the darkest and remotest corner of  the Theatre Gallery.&#x27;  He was to be seen issuing from &#x27;aerial  lodging-houses.&#x27;  Withal, says mine author, &#x27;there were many  good points about him: he paid his landlady&#x27;s bill, read his  Bible, went twice to church on Sunday, seldom swore, was not  often tipsy, and bought the LAPSUS LINGUAE.&#x27;</p>
<p>The MEDICAL, again, &#x27;wore a white greatcoat, and consequently  talked loud&#x27; - (there is something very delicious in that  CONSEQUENTLY).  He wore his hat on one side.  He was active,  volatile, and went to the top of Arthur&#x27;s Seat on the Sunday  forenoon.  He was as quiet in a debating society as he was  loud in the streets.  He was reckless and imprudent:  yesterday he insisted on your sharing a bottle of claret with  him (and claret was claret then, before the cheap-and-nasty  treaty), and to-morrow he asks you for the loan of a penny to  buy the last number of the LAPSUS.</p>
<p>The student of LAW, again, was a learned man.  &#x27;He had turned  over the leaves of Justinian&#x27;s INSTITUTES, and knew that they  were written in Latin.  He was well acquainted with the  title-page of Blackstone&#x27;s COMMENTARIES, and ARGAL (as the  gravedigger in HAMLET says) he was not a person to be laughed  at.&#x27;  He attended the Parliament House in the character of a  critic, and could give you stale sneers at all the celebrated  speakers.  He was the terror of essayists at the Speculative  or the Forensic.  In social qualities he seems to have stood  unrivalled.  Even in the police-office we find him shining  with undiminished lustre.  &#x27;If a CHARLIE should find him  rather noisy at an untimely hour, and venture to take him  into custody, he appears next morning like a Daniel come to  judgment.  He opens his mouth to speak, and the divine  precepts of unchanging justice and Scots law flow from his  tongue.  The magistrate listens in amazement, and fines him  only a couple of guineas.&#x27;</p>
<p>Such then were our predecessors and their College Magazine.   Barclay, Ambrose, Young Amos, and Fergusson were to them what  the Cafe, the Rainbow, and Rutherford&#x27;s are to us.  An hour&#x27;s  reading in these old pages absolutely confuses us, there is  so much that is similar and so much that is different; the  follies and amusements are so like our own, and the manner of  frolicking and enjoying are so changed, that one pauses and  looks about him in philosophic judgment.  The muddy  quadrangle is thick with living students; but in our eyes it  swarms also with the phantasmal white greatcoats and tilted  hats of 1824.  Two races meet: races alike and diverse.  Two  performances are played before our eyes; but the change seems  merely of impersonators, of scenery, of costume.  Plot and  passion are the same.  It is the fall of the spun shilling  whether seventy-one or twenty-four has the best of it.</p>
<p>In a future number we hope to give a glance at the  individualities of the present, and see whether the cast  shall be head or tail - whether we or the readers of the  LAPSUS stand higher in the balance.</p>
<p>COLLEGE PAPERS CHAPTER II - THE MODERN STUDENT CONSIDERED GENERALLY</p>
<p>WE have now reached the difficult portion of our task.  MR.  TATLER, for all that we care, may have been as virulent as he  liked about the students of a former; but for the iron to  touch our sacred selves, for a brother of the Guild to betray  its most privy infirmities, let such a Judas look to himself  as he passes on his way to the Scots Law or the Diagnostic,  below the solitary lamp at the corner of the dark quadrangle.   We confess that this idea alarms us.  We enter a protest.  We  bind ourselves over verbally to keep the peace.  We hope,  moreover, that having thus made you secret to our misgivings,  you will excuse us if we be dull, and set that down to  caution which you might before have charged to the account of  stupidity.</p>
<p>The natural tendency of civilisation is to obliterate those  distinctions which are the best salt of life.  All the fine  old professional flavour in language has evaporated.  Your  very gravedigger has forgotten his avocation in his  electorship, and would quibble on the Franchise over  Ophelia&#x27;s grave, instead of more appropriately discussing the  duration of bodies under ground.  From this tendency, from  this gradual attrition of life, in which everything pointed  and characteristic is being rubbed down, till the whole world  begins to slip between our fingers in smooth  undistinguishable sands, from this, we say, it follows that  we must not attempt to join MR. TALLER in his simple division  of students into LAW, DIVINITY, and MEDICAL.  Nowadays the  Faculties may shake hands over their follies; and, like Mrs.  Frail and Mrs. Foresight (in LOVE FOR LOVE) they may stand in  the doors of opposite class-rooms, crying: &#x27;Sister, Sister - Sister everyway!&#x27;  A few restrictions, indeed, remain to  influence the followers of individual branches of study.  The  Divinity, for example, must be an avowed believer; and as  this, in the present day, is unhappily considered by many as  a confession of weakness, he is fain to choose one of two  ways of gilding the distasteful orthodox bolus.  Some swallow  it in a thin jelly of metaphysics; for it is even a credit to  believe in God on the evidence of some crack-jaw philosopher,  although it is a decided slur to believe in Him on His own  authority.  Others again (and this we think the worst  method), finding German grammar a somewhat dry morsel, run  their own little heresy as a proof of independence; and deny  one of the cardinal doctrines that they may hold the others  without being laughed at.</p>
<p>Besides, however, such influences as these, there is little  more distinction between the faculties than the traditionary  ideal, handed down through a long sequence of students, and  getting rounder and more featureless at each successive  session.  The plague of uniformity has descended on the  College.  Students (and indeed all sorts and conditions of  men) now require their faculty and character hung round their  neck on a placard, like the scenes in Shakespeare&#x27;s theatre.   And in the midst of all this weary sameness, not the least  common feature is the gravity of every face.  No more does  the merry medical run eagerly in the clear winter morning up  the rugged sides of Arthur&#x27;s Seat, and hear the church bells  begin and thicken and die away below him among the gathered  smoke of the city.  He will not break Sunday to so little  purpose.  He no longer finds pleasure in the mere output of  his surplus energy.  He husbands his strength, and lays out  walks, and reading, and amusement with deep consideration, so  that he may get as much work and pleasure out of his body as  he can, and waste none of his energy on mere impulse, or such  flat enjoyment as an excursion in the country.</p>
<p>See the quadrangle in the interregnum of classes, in those  two or three minutes when it is full of passing students, and  we think you will admit that, if we have not made it &#x27;an  habitation of dragons,&#x27; we have at least transformed it into  &#x27;a court for owls.&#x27;  Solemnity broods heavily over the  enclosure; and wherever you seek it, you will find a dearth  of merriment, an absence of real youthful enjoyment.  You  might as well try</p>
<p>&#x27;To move wild laughter in the throat of death&#x27;</p>
<p>as to excite any healthy stir among the bulk of this staid  company.</p>
<p>The studious congregate about the doors of the different  classes, debating the matter of the lecture, or comparing  note-books.  A reserved rivalry sunders them.  Here are some  deep in Greek particles: there, others are already  inhabitants of that land</p>
<p>&#x27;Where entity and quiddity, &#x27;Like ghosts of defunct bodies fly - Where Truth in person does appear Like words congealed in northern air.&#x27;</p>
<p>But none of them seem to find any relish for their studies -  no pedantic love of this subject or that lights up their eyes  - science and learning are only means for a livelihood, which  they have considerately embraced and which they solemnly  pursue.  &#x27;Labour&#x27;s pale priests,&#x27; their lips seem incapable  of laughter, except in the way of polite recognition of  professorial wit.  The stains of ink are chronic on their  meagre fingers.  They walk like Saul among the asses.</p>
<p>The dandies are not less subdued.  In 1824 there was a noisy  dapper dandyism abroad.  Vulgar, as we should now think, but  yet genial - a matter of white greatcoats and loud voices -  strangely different from the stately frippery that is rife at  present.  These men are out of their element in the  quadrangle.  Even the small remains of boisterous humour,  which still clings to any collection of young men, jars  painfully on their morbid sensibilities; and they beat a  hasty retreat to resume their perfunctory march along Princes  Street.  Flirtation is to them a great social duty, a painful  obligation, which they perform on every occasion in the same  chill official manner, and with the same commonplace  advances, the same dogged observance of traditional  behaviour.  The shape of their raiment is a burden almost  greater than they can bear, and they halt in their walk to  preserve the due adjustment of their trouser-knees, till one  would fancy he had mixed in a procession of Jacobs.  We  speak, of course, for ourselves; but we would as soon  associate with a herd of sprightly apes as with these gloomy  modern beaux.  Alas, that our Mirabels, our Valentines, even  our Brummels, should have left their mantles upon nothing  more amusing!</p>
<p>Nor are the fast men less constrained.  Solemnity, even in  dissipation, is the order of the day; and they go to the  devil with a perverse seriousness, a systematic rationalism  of wickedness that would have surprised the simpler sinners  of old.  Some of these men whom we see gravely conversing on  the steps have but a slender acquaintance with each other.   Their intercourse consists principally of mutual bulletins of  depravity; and, week after week, as they meet they reckon up  their items of transgression, and give an abstract of their  downward progress for approval and encouragement.  These folk  form a freemasonry of their own.  An oath is the shibboleth  of their sinister fellowship.  Once they hear a man swear, it  is wonderful how their tongues loosen and their bashful  spirits take enlargement, under the consciousness of  brotherhood.  There is no folly, no pardoning warmth of  temper about them; they are as steady-going and systematic in  their own way as the studious in theirs.</p>
<p>Not that we are without merry men.  No.  We shall not be  ungrateful to those, whose grimaces, whose ironical laughter,  whose active feet in the &#x27;College Anthem&#x27; have beguiled so  many weary hours and added a pleasant variety to the strain  of close attention.  But even these are too evidently  professional in their antics.  They go about cogitating puns  and inventing tricks.  It is their vocation, Hal.  They are  the gratuitous jesters of the class-room; and, like the clown  when he leaves the stage, their merriment too often sinks as  the bell rings the hour of liberty, and they pass forth by  the Post-Office, grave and sedate, and meditating fresh  gambols for the morrow.</p>
<p>This is the impression left on the mind of any observing  student by too many of his fellows.  They seem all frigid old  men; and one pauses to think how such an unnatural state of  matters is produced.  We feel inclined to blame for it the  unfortunate absence of UNIVERSITY FEELING which is so marked  a characteristic of our Edinburgh students.  Academical  interests are so few and far between - students, as students,  have so little in common, except a peevish rivalry - there is  such an entire want of broad college sympathies and ordinary  college friendships, that we fancy that no University in the  kingdom is in so poor a plight.  Our system is full of  anomalies.  A, who cut B whilst he was a shabby student,  curries sedulously up to him and cudgels his memory for  anecdotes about him when he becomes the great so-and-so.  Let  there be an end of this shy, proud reserve on the one hand,  and this shuddering fine ladyism on the other; and we think  we shall find both ourselves and the College bettered.  Let  it be a sufficient reason for intercourse that two men sit  together on the same benches.  Let the great A be held  excused for nodding to the shabby B in Princes Street, if he  can say, &#x27;That fellow is a student.&#x27;  Once this could be  brought about, we think you would find the whole heart of the  University beat faster.  We think you would find a fusion  among the students, a growth of common feelings, an  increasing sympathy between class and class, whose influence  (in such a heterogeneous company as ours) might be of  incalculable value in all branches of politics and social  progress.  It would do more than this.  If we could find some  method of making the University a real mother to her sons -  something beyond a building of class-rooms, a Senatus and a  lottery of somewhat shabby prizes - we should strike a death- blow at the constrained and unnatural attitude of our  Society.  At present we are not a united body, but a loose  gathering of individuals, whose inherent attraction is  allowed to condense them into little knots and coteries.  Our  last snowball riot read us a plain lesson on our condition.   There was no party spirit - no unity of interests.  A few,  who were mischievously inclined, marched off to the College  of Surgeons in a pretentious file; but even before they  reached their destination the feeble inspiration had died out  in many, and their numbers were sadly thinned.  Some followed  strange gods in the direction of Drummond Street, and others  slunk back to meek good-boyism at the feet of the Professors.   The same is visible in better things.  As you send a man to  an English University that he may have his prejudices rubbed  off, you might send him to Edinburgh that he may have them  ingrained - rendered indelible - fostered by sympathy into  living principles of his spirit.  And the reason of it is  quite plain.  From this absence of University feeling it  comes that a man&#x27;s friendships are always the direct and  immediate results of these very prejudices.  A common  weakness is the best master of ceremonies in our quadrangle:  a mutual vice is the readiest introduction.  The studious  associate with the studious alone - the dandies with the  dandies.  There is nothing to force them to rub shoulders  with the others; and so they grow day by day more wedded to  their own original opinions and affections.  They see through  the same spectacles continually.  All broad sentiments, all  real catholic humanity expires; and the mind gets gradually  stiffened into one position - becomes so habituated to a  contracted atmosphere, that it shudders and withers under the  least draught of the free air that circulates in the general  field of mankind.</p>
<p>Specialism in Society then is, we think, one cause of our  present state.  Specialism in study is another.  We doubt  whether this has ever been a good thing since the world  began; but we are sure it is much worse now than it was.   Formerly, when a man became a specialist, it was out of  affection for his subject.  With a somewhat grand devotion he  left all the world of Science to follow his true love; and he  contrived to find that strange pedantic interest which  inspired the man who</p>
<p>&#x27;Settled HOTI&#x27;S business - let it be - Properly based OUN - Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic DE, Dead from the waist down.&#x27;</p>
<p>Nowadays it is quite different.  Our pedantry wants even the  saving clause of Enthusiasm.  The election is now matter of  necessity and not of choice.  Knowledge is now too broad a  field for your Jack-of-all-Trades; and, from beautifully  utilitarian reasons, he makes his choice, draws his pen  through a dozen branches of study, and behold - John the  Specialist.  That this is the way to be wealthy we shall not  deny; but we hold that it is NOT the way to be healthy or  wise.  The whole mind becomes narrowed and circumscribed to  one &#x27;punctual spot&#x27; of knowledge.  A rank unhealthy soil  breeds a harvest of prejudices.  Feeling himself above others  in his one little branch - in the classification of  toadstools, or Carthaginian history - he waxes great in his  own eyes and looks down on others.  Having all his sympathies  educated in one way, they die out in every other; and he is  apt to remain a peevish, narrow, and intolerant bigot.   Dilettante is now a term of reproach; but there is a certain  form of dilettantism to which no one can object.  It is this  that we want among our students.  We wish them to abandon no  subject until they have seen and felt its merit - to act  under a general interest in all branches of knowledge, not a  commercial eagerness to excel in one.</p>
<p>In both these directions our sympathies are constipated.  We  are apostles of our own caste and our own subject of study,  instead of being, as we should, true men and LOVING students.   Of course both of these could be corrected by the students  themselves; but this is nothing to the purpose: it is more  important to ask whether the Senatus or the body of alumni  could do nothing towards the growth of better feeling and  wider sentiments.  Perhaps in another paper we may say  something upon this head.</p>
<p>One other word, however, before we have done.  What shall we  be when we grow really old?  Of yore, a man was thought to  lay on restrictions and acquire new deadweight of mournful  experience with every year, till he looked back on his youth  as the very summer of impulse and freedom.  We please  ourselves with thinking that it cannot be so with us.  We  would fain hope that, as we have begun in one way, we may end  in another; and that when we are in fact the octogenarians  that we SEEM at present, there shall be no merrier men on  earth.  It is pleasant to picture us, sunning ourselves in  Princes Street of a morning, or chirping over our evening  cups, with all the merriment that we wanted in youth.</p>
<p>COLLEGE PAPERS CHAPTER III - DEBATING SOCIETIES</p>
<p>A DEBATING society is at first somewhat of a disappointment.   You do not often find the youthful Demosthenes chewing his  pebbles in the same room with you; or, even if you do, you  will probably think the performance little to be admired.  As  a general rule, the members speak shamefully ill.  The  subjects of debate are heavy; and so are the fines.  The  Ballot Question - oldest of dialectic nightmares - is often  found astride of a somnolent sederunt.  The Greeks and  Romans, too, are reserved as sort of GENERAL-UTILITY men, to  do all the dirty work of illustration; and they fill as many  functions as the famous waterfall scene at the &#x27;Princess&#x27;s,&#x27;  which I found doing duty on one evening as a gorge in Peru, a  haunt of German robbers, and a peaceful vale in the Scottish  borders.  There is a sad absence of striking argument or real  lively discussion.  Indeed, you feel a growing contempt for  your fellow-members; and it is not until you rise yourself to  hawk and hesitate and sit shamefully down again, amid  eleemosynary applause, that you begin to find your level and  value others rightly.  Even then, even when failure has  damped your critical ardour, you will see many things to be  laughed at in the deportment of your rivals.</p>
<p>Most laughable, perhaps, are your indefatigable strivers  after eloquence.  They are of those who &#x27;pursue with  eagerness the phantoms of hope,&#x27; and who, since they expect  that &#x27;the deficiencies of last sentence will be supplied by  the next,&#x27; have been recommended by Dr. Samuel Johnson to  &#x27;attend to the History of Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia.&#x27;   They are characterised by a hectic hopefulness.  Nothing  damps them.  They rise from the ruins of one abortive  sentence, to launch forth into another with unabated vigour.   They have all the manner of an orator.  From the tone of  their voice, you would expect a splendid period - and lo! a  string of broken-backed, disjointed clauses, eked out with  stammerings and throat-clearings.  They possess the art  (learned from the pulpit) of rounding an uneuphonious  sentence by dwelling on a single syllable - of striking a  balance in a top-heavy period by lengthening out a word into  a melancholy quaver.  Withal, they never cease to hope.  Even  at last, even when they have exhausted all their ideas, even  after the would-be peroration has finally refused to  perorate, they remain upon their feet with their mouths open,  waiting for some further inspiration, like Chaucer&#x27;s widow&#x27;s  son in the dung-hole, after</p>
<p>&#x27;His throat was kit unto the nekke bone,&#x27;</p>
<p>in vain expectation of that seed that was to be laid upon his  tongue, and give him renewed and clearer utterance.</p>
<p>These men may have something to say, if they could only say  it - indeed they generally have; but the next class are  people who, having nothing to say, are cursed with a facility  and an unhappy command of words, that makes them the prime  nuisances of the society they affect.  They try to cover  their absence of matter by an unwholesome vitality of  delivery.  They look triumphantly round the room, as if  courting applause, after a torrent of diluted truism.  They  talk in a circle, harping on the same dull round of argument,  and returning again and again to the same remark with the  same sprightliness, the same irritating appearance of  novelty.</p>
<p>After this set, any one is tolerable; so we shall merely hint  at a few other varieties.  There is your man who is pre- eminently conscientious, whose face beams with sincerity as  he opens on the negative, and who votes on the affirmative at  the end, looking round the room with an air of chastened  pride.  There is also the irrelevant speaker, who rises,  emits a joke or two, and then sits down again, without ever  attempting to tackle the subject of debate.  Again, we have  men who ride pick-a-back on their family reputation, or, if  their family have none, identify themselves with some well- known statesman, use his opinions, and lend him their  patronage on all occasions.  This is a dangerous plan, and  serves oftener, I am afraid, to point a difference than to  adorn a speech.</p>
<p>But alas! a striking failure may be reached without tempting  Providence by any of these ambitious tricks.  Our own stature  will be found high enough for shame.  The success of three  simple sentences lures us into a fatal parenthesis in the  fourth, from whose shut brackets we may never disentangle the  thread of our discourse.  A momentary flush tempts us into a  quotation; and we may be left helpless in the middle of one  of Pope&#x27;s couplets, a white film gathering before our eyes,  and our kind friends charitably trying to cover our disgrace  by a feeble round of applause.  AMIS LECTEURS, this is a  painful topic.  It is possible that we too, we, the &#x27;potent,  grave, and reverend&#x27; editor, may have suffered these things,  and drunk as deep as any of the cup of shameful failure.  Let  us dwell no longer on so delicate a subject.</p>
<p>In spite, however, of these disagreeables, I should recommend  any student to suffer them with Spartan courage, as the  benefits he receives should repay him an hundredfold for them  all.  The life of the debating society is a handy antidote to  the life of the classroom and quadrangle.  Nothing could be  conceived more excellent as a weapon against many of those  PECCANT HUMOURS that we have been railing against in the  jeremiad of our last &#x27;College Paper&#x27; - particularly in the  field of intellect.  It is a sad sight to see our heather- scented students, our boys of seventeen, coming up to College  with determined views - ROUES in speculation - having gauged  the vanity of philosophy or learned to shun it as the middle- man of heresy - a company of determined, deliberate  opinionists, not to be moved by all the sleights of logic.   What have such men to do with study?  If their minds are made  up irrevocably, why burn the &#x27;studious lamp&#x27; in search of  further confirmation?  Every set opinion I hear a student  deliver I feel a certain lowering of my regard.  He who  studies, he who is yet employed in groping for his premises,  should keep his mind fluent and sensitive, keen to mark  flaws, and willing to surrender untenable positions.  He  should keep himself teachable, or cease the expensive farce  of being taught.  It is to further this docile spirit that we  desire to press the claims of debating societies.  It is as a  means of melting down this museum of premature petrifactions  into living and impressionable soul that we insist on their  utility.  If we could once prevail on our students to feel no  shame in avowing an uncertain attitude towards any subject,  if we could teach them that it was unnecessary for every lad  to have his OPINIONETTE on every topic, we should have gone a  far way towards bracing the intellectual tone of the coming  race of thinkers; and this it is which debating societies are  so well fitted to perform.</p>
<p>We there meet people of every shade of opinion, and make  friends with them.  We are taught to rail against a man the  whole session through, and then hob-a-nob with him at the  concluding entertainment.  We find men of talent far  exceeding our own, whose conclusions are widely different  from ours; and we are thus taught to distrust ourselves.  But  the best means of all towards catholicity is that wholesome  rule which some folk are most inclined to condemn - I mean  the law of OBLIGED SPEECHES.  Your senior member commands;  and you must take the affirmative or the negative, just as  suits his best convenience.  This tends to the most perfect  liberality.  It is no good hearing the arguments of an  opponent, for in good verity you rarely follow them; and even  if you do take the trouble to listen, it is merely in a  captious search for weaknesses.  This is proved, I fear, in  every debate; when you hear each speaker arguing out his own  prepared SPECIALITE (he never intended speaking, of course,  until some remarks of, etc.), arguing out, I say, his own  COACHED-UP subject without the least attention to what has  gone before, as utterly at sea about the drift of his  adversary&#x27;s speech as Panurge when he argued with Thaumaste,  and merely linking his own prelection to the last by a few  flippant criticisms.  Now, as the rule stands, you are  saddled with the side you disapprove, and so you are forced,  by regard for your own fame, to argue out, to feel with, to  elaborate completely, the case as it stands against yourself;  and what a fund of wisdom do you not turn up in this idle  digging of the vineyard!  How many new difficulties take form  before your eyes? how many superannuated arguments cripple  finally into limbo, under the glance of your enforced  eclecticism!</p>
<p>Nor is this the only merit of Debating Societies.  They tend  also to foster taste, and to promote friendship between  University men.  This last, as we have had occasion before to  say, is the great requirement of our student life; and it  will therefore be no waste of time if we devote a paragraph  to this subject in its connection with Debating Societies.   At present they partake too much of the nature of a CLIQUE.   Friends propose friends, and mutual friends second them,  until the society degenerates into a sort of family party.   You may confirm old acquaintances, but you can rarely make  new ones.  You find yourself in the atmosphere of your own  daily intercourse.  Now, this is an unfortunate circumstance,  which it seems to me might readily be rectified.  Our  Principal has shown himself so friendly towards all College  improvements that I cherish the hope of seeing shortly  realised a certain suggestion, which is not a new one with  me, and which must often have been proposed and canvassed  heretofore - I mean, a real UNIVERSITY DEBATING SOCIETY,  patronised by the Senatus, presided over by the Professors,  to which every one might gain ready admittance on sight of  his matriculation ticket, where it would be a favour and not  a necessity to speak, and where the obscure student might  have another object for attendance besides the mere desire to  save his fines: to wit, the chance of drawing on himself the  favourable consideration of his teachers.  This would be  merely following in the good tendency, which has been so  noticeable during all this session, to increase and multiply  student societies and clubs of every sort.  Nor would it be a  matter of much difficulty.  The united societies would form a  nucleus: one of the class-rooms at first, and perhaps  afterwards the great hall above the library, might be the  place of meeting.  There would be no want of attendance or  enthusiasm, I am sure; for it is a very different thing to  speak under the bushel of a private club on the one hand,  and, on the other, in a public place, where a happy period or  a subtle argument may do the speaker permanent service in  after life.  Such a club might end, perhaps, by rivalling the  &#x27;Union&#x27; at Cambridge or the &#x27;Union&#x27; at Oxford.</p>
<p>COLLEGE PAPERS CHAPTER IV - THE PHILOSOPHY OF UMBRELLAS (1)</p>
<p>IT is wonderful to think what a turn has been given to our  whole Society by the fact that we live under the sign of  Aquarius - that our climate is essentially wet.  A mere  arbitrary distinction, like the walking-swords of yore, might  have remained the symbol of foresight and respectability, had  not the raw mists and dropping showers of our island pointed  the inclination of Society to another exponent of those  virtues.  A ribbon of the Legion of Honour or a string of  medals may prove a person&#x27;s courage; a title may prove his  birth; a professorial chair his study and acquirement; but it  is the habitual carriage of the umbrella that is the stamp of  Respectability.  The umbrella has become the acknowledged  index of social position.</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe presents us with a touching instance of the  hankering after them inherent in the civilised and educated  mind.  To the superficial, the hot suns of Juan Fernandez may  sufficiently account for his quaint choice of a luxury; but  surely one who had borne the hard labour of a seaman under  the tropics for all these years could have supported an  excursion after goats or a peaceful CONSTITUTIONAL arm in arm  with the nude Friday.  No, it was not this: the memory of a  vanished respectability called for some outward  manifestation, and the result was - an umbrella.  A pious  castaway might have rigged up a belfry and solaced his Sunday  mornings with the mimicry of church-bells; but Crusoe was  rather a moralist than a pietist, and his leaf-umbrella is as  fine an example of the civilised mind striving to express  itself under adverse circumstances as we have ever met with.</p>
<p>It is not for nothing, either, that the umbrella has become  the very foremost badge of modern civilisation - the Urim and  Thummim of respectability.  Its pregnant symbolism has taken  its rise in the most natural manner.  Consider, for a moment,  when umbrellas were first introduced into this country, what  manner of men would use them, and what class would adhere to  the useless but ornamental cane.  The first, without doubt,  would be the hypochondriacal, out of solicitude for their  health, or the frugal, out of care for their raiment; the  second, it is equally plain, would include the fop, the fool,  and the Bobadil.  Any one acquainted with the growth of  Society, and knowing out of what small seeds of cause are  produced great revolutions, and wholly new conditions of  intercourse, sees from this simple thought how the carriage  of an umbrella came to indicate frugality, judicious regard  for bodily welfare, and scorn for mere outward adornment,  and, in one word, all those homely and solid virtues implied  in the term RESPECTABILITY.  Not that the umbrella&#x27;s  costliness has nothing to do with its great influence.  Its  possession, besides symbolising (as we have already  indicated) the change from wild Esau to plain Jacob dwelling  in tents, implies a certain comfortable provision of fortune.   It is not every one that can expose twenty-six shillings&#x27;  worth of property to so many chances of loss and theft.  So  strongly do we feel on this point, indeed, that we are almost  inclined to consider all who possess really well-conditioned  umbrellas as worthy of the Franchise.  They have a  qualification standing in their lobbies; they carry a  sufficient stake in the common-weal below their arm.  One who  bears with him an umbrella - such a complicated structure of  whalebone, of silk, and of cane, that it becomes a very  microcosm of modern industry - is necessarily a man of peace.   A half-crown cane may be applied to an offender&#x27;s head on a  very moderate provocation; but a six-and-twenty shilling silk  is a possession too precious to be adventured in the shock of  war.</p>
<p>These are but a few glances at how umbrellas (in the general)  came to their present high estate.  But the true Umbrella- Philosopher meets with far stranger applications as he goes  about the streets.</p>
<p>Umbrellas, like faces, acquire a certain sympathy with the  individual who carries them: indeed, they are far more  capable of betraying his trust; for whereas a face is given  to us so far ready made, and all our power over it is in  frowning, and laughing, and grimacing, during the first three  or four decades of life, each umbrella is selected from a  whole shopful, as being most consonant to the purchaser&#x27;s  disposition.  An undoubted power of diagnosis rests with the  practised Umbrella-Philosopher.  O you who lisp, and amble,  and change the fashion of your countenances - you who conceal  all these, how little do you think that you left a proof of  your weakness in our umbrella-stand - that even now, as you  shake out the folds to meet the thickening snow, we read in  its ivory handle the outward and visible sign of your  snobbery, or from the exposed gingham of its cover detect,  through coat and waistcoat, the hidden hypocrisy of the  &#x27;DICKEY&#x27;!  But alas! even the umbrella is no certain  criterion.  The falsity and the folly of the human race have  degraded that graceful symbol to the ends of dishonesty; and  while some umbrellas, from carelessness in selection, are not  strikingly characteristic (for it is only in what a man loves  that he displays his real nature), others, from certain  prudential motives, are chosen directly opposite to the  person&#x27;s disposition.  A mendacious umbrella is a sign of  great moral degradation.  Hypocrisy naturally shelters itself  below a silk; while the fast youth goes to visit his  religious friends armed with the decent and reputable  gingham.  May it not be said of the bearers of these  inappropriate umbrellas that they go about the streets &#x27;with  a lie in their right hand&#x27;?</p>
<p>The kings of Siam, as we read, besides having a graduated  social scale of umbrellas (which was a good thing), prevented  the great bulk of their subjects from having any at all,  which was certainly a bad thing.  We should be sorry to  believe that this Eastern legislator was a fool - the idea of  an aristocracy of umbrellas is too philosophic to have  originated in a nobody - and we have accordingly taken  exceeding pains to find out the reason of this harsh  restriction.  We think we have succeeded; but, while admiring  the principle at which he aimed, and while cordially  recognising in the Siamese potentate the only man before  ourselves who had taken a real grasp of the umbrella, we must  be allowed to point out how unphilosophically the great man  acted in this particular.  His object, plainly, was to  prevent any unworthy persons from bearing the sacred symbol  of domestic virtues.  We cannot excuse his limiting these  virtues to the circle of his court.  We must only remember  that such was the feeling of the age in which he lived.   Liberalism had not yet raised the war-cry of the working  classes.  But here was his mistake: it was a needless  regulation.  Except in a very few cases of hypocrisy joined  to a powerful intellect, men, not by nature UMBRELLARIANS,  have tried again and again to become so by art, and yet have  failed - have expended their patrimony in the purchase of  umbrella after umbrella, and yet have systematically lost  them, and have finally, with contrite spirits and shrunken  purses, given up their vain struggle, and relied on theft and  borrowing for the remainder of their lives.  This is the most  remarkable fact that we have had occasion to notice; and yet  we challenge the candid reader to call it in question.  Now,  as there cannot be any MORAL SELECTION in a mere dead piece  of furniture - as the umbrella cannot be supposed to have an  affinity for individual men equal and reciprocal to that  which men certainly feel toward individual umbrellas - we  took the trouble of consulting a scientific friend as to  whether there was any possible physical explanation of the  phenomenon.  He was unable to supply a plausible theory, or  even hypothesis; but we extract from his letter the following  interesting passage relative to the physical peculiarities of  umbrellas: &#x27;Not the least important, and by far the most  curious property of the umbrella, is the energy which it  displays in affecting the atmospheric strata.  There is no  fact in meteorology better established - indeed, it is almost  the only one on which meteorologists are agreed - than that  the carriage of an umbrella produces desiccation of the air;  while if it be left at home, aqueous vapour is largely  produced, and is soon deposited in the form of rain.  No  theory,&#x27; my friend continues, &#x27;competent to explain this  hygrometric law has been given (as far as I am aware) by  Herschel, Dove, Glaisher, Tait, Buchan, or any other writer;  nor do I pretend to supply the defect.  I venture, however,  to throw out the conjecture that it will be ultimately found  to belong to the same class of natural laws as that agreeable  to which a slice of toast always descends with the buttered  surface downwards.&#x27;</p>
<p>But it is time to draw to a close.  We could expatiate much  longer upon this topic, but want of space constrains us to  leave unfinished these few desultory remarks - slender  contributions towards a subject which has fallen sadly  backward, and which, we grieve to say, was better understood  by the king of Siam in 1686 than by all the philosophers of  to-day.  If, however, we have awakened in any rational mind  an interest in the symbolism of umbrellas - in any generous  heart a more complete sympathy with the dumb companion of his  daily walk - or in any grasping spirit a pure notion of  respectability strong enough to make him expend his six-and- twenty shillings - we shall have deserved well of the world,  to say nothing of the many industrious persons employed in  the manufacture of the article.</p>

<p>COLLEGE PAPERS CHAPTER V - THE PHILOSOPHY OF NOMENCLATURE</p>
<p>&#x27;How many Caesars and Pompeys, by mere inspirations of the  names, have been rendered worthy of them?  And how many are  there, who might have done exceeding well in the world, had  not their characters and spirits been totally depressed and  Nicodemus&#x27;d into nothing?&#x27; - TRISTRAM SHANDY, vol. I. chap  xix.</p>
<p>Such were the views of the late Walter Shandy, Esq., Turkey  merchant.  To the best of my belief, Mr. Shandy is the first  who fairly pointed out the incalculable influence of  nomenclature upon the whole life - who seems first to have  recognised the one child, happy in an heroic appellation,  soaring upwards on the wings of fortune, and the other, like  the dead sailor in his shotted hammock, haled down by sheer  weight of name into the abysses of social failure.  Solomon  possibly had his eye on some such theory when he said that &#x27;a  good name is better than precious ointment&#x27;; and perhaps we  may trace a similar spirit in the compilers of the English  Catechism, and the affectionate interest with which they  linger round the catechumen&#x27;s name at the very threshold of  their work.  But, be these as they may, I think no one can  censure me for appending, in pursuance of the expressed wish  of his son, the Turkey merchant&#x27;s name to his system, and  pronouncing, without further preface, a short epitome of the  &#x27;Shandean Philosophy of Nomenclature.&#x27;</p>
<p>To begin, then: the influence of our name makes itself felt  from the very cradle.  As a schoolboy I remember the pride  with which I hailed Robin Hood, Robert Bruce, and Robert le  Diable as my name-fellows; and the feeling of sore  disappointment that fell on my heart when I found a  freebooter or a general who did not share with me a single  one of my numerous PRAENOMINA.  Look at the delight with  which two children find they have the same name.  They are  friends from that moment forth; they have a bond of union  stronger than exchange of nuts and sweetmeats.  This feeling,  I own, wears off in later life.  Our names lose their  freshness and interest, become trite and indifferent.  But  this, dear reader, is merely one of the sad effects of those  &#x27;shades of the prison-house&#x27; which come gradually betwixt us  and nature with advancing years; it affords no weapon against  the philosophy of names.</p>
<p>In after life, although we fail to trace its working, that  name which careless godfathers lightly applied to your  unconscious infancy will have been moulding your character,  and influencing with irresistible power the whole course of  your earthly fortunes.  But the last name, overlooked by Mr.  Shandy, is no whit less important as a condition of success.   Family names, we must recollect, are but inherited nicknames;  and if the SOBRIQUET were applicable to the ancestor, it is  most likely applicable to the descendant also.  You would not  expect to find Mr. M&#x27;Phun acting as a mute, or Mr. M&#x27;Lumpha  excelling as a professor of dancing.  Therefore, in what  follows, we shall consider names, independent of whether they  are first or last.  And to begin with, look what a pull  CROMWELL had over PYM - the one name full of a resonant  imperialism, the other, mean, pettifogging, and unheroic to a  degree.  Who would expect eloquence from PYM - who would read  poems by PYM - who would bow to the opinion of PYM?  He might  have been a dentist, but he should never have aspired to be a  statesman.  I can only wonder that he succeeded as he did.   Pym and Habakkuk stand first upon the roll of men who have  triumphed, by sheer force of genius, over the most  unfavourable appellations.  But even these have suffered;  and, had they been more fitly named, the one might have been  Lord Protector, and the other have shared the laurels with  Isaiah.  In this matter we must not forget that all our great  poets have borne great names.  Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare,  Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, Shelley - what a constellation of  lordly words!  Not a single common-place name among them -  not a Brown, not a Jones, not a Robinson; they are all names  that one would stop and look at on a door-plate.  Now,  imagine if PEPYS had tried to clamber somehow into the  enclosure of poetry, what a blot would that word have made  upon the list!  The thing was impossible.  In the first place  a certain natural consciousness that men would have held him  down to the level of his name, would have prevented him from  rising above the Pepsine standard, and so haply withheld him  altogether from attempting verse.  Next, the booksellers  would refuse to publish, and the world to read them, on the  mere evidence of the fatal appellation.  And now, before I  close this section, I must say one word as to PUNNABLE names,  names that stand alone, that have a significance and life  apart from him that bears them.  These are the bitterest of  all.  One friend of mine goes bowed and humbled through life  under the weight of this misfortune; for it is an awful thing  when a man&#x27;s name is a joke, when he cannot be mentioned  without exciting merriment, and when even the intimation of  his death bids fair to carry laughter into many a home.</p>
<p>So much for people who are badly named.  Now for people who  are TOO well named, who go top-heavy from the font, who are  baptized into a false position, and find themselves beginning  life eclipsed under the fame of some of the great ones of the  past.  A man, for instance, called William Shakespeare could  never dare to write plays.  He is thrown into too humbling an  apposition with the author of HAMLET.  Its own name coming  after is such an anti-climax.  &#x27;The plays of William  Shakespeare&#x27;? says the reader - &#x27;O no!  The plays of William  Shakespeare Cockerill,&#x27; and he throws the book aside.  In  wise pursuance of such views, Mr. John Milton Hengler, who  not long since delighted us in this favoured town, has never  attempted to write an epic, but has chosen a new path, and  has excelled upon the tight-rope.  A marked example of  triumph over this is the case of Mr. Dante Gabriel Rossetti.   On the face of the matter, I should have advised him to  imitate the pleasing modesty of the last-named gentleman, and  confine his ambition to the sawdust.  But Mr. Rossetti has  triumphed.  He has even dared to translate from his mighty  name-father; and the voice of fame supports him in his  boldness.</p>
<p>Dear readers, one might write a year upon this matter.  A  lifetime of comparison and research could scarce suffice for  its elucidation.  So here, if it please you, we shall let it  rest.  Slight as these notes have been, I would that the  great founder of the system had been alive to see them.  How  he had warmed and brightened, how his persuasive eloquence  would have fallen on the ears of Toby; and what a letter of  praise and sympathy would not the editor have received before  the month was out!  Alas, the thing was not to be.  Walter  Shandy died and was duly buried, while yet his theory lay  forgotten and neglected by his fellow-countrymen.  But,  reader, the day will come, I hope, when a paternal government  will stamp out, as seeds of national weakness, all depressing  patronymics, and when godfathers and godmothers will soberly  and earnestly debate the interest of the nameless one, and  not rush blindfold to the christening.  In these days there  shall be written a &#x27;Godfather&#x27;s Assistant,&#x27; in shape of a  dictionary of names, with their concomitant virtues and  vices; and this book shall be scattered broadcast through the  land, and shall be on the table of every one eligible for  godfathership, until such a thing as a vicious or untoward  appellation shall have ceased from off the face of the earth.</p>
<p>CRITICISMS CHAPTER I - LORD LYTTON&#x27;S &#x27;FABLES IN SONG&#x27;</p>
<p>IT seems as if Lord Lytton, in this new book of his, had  found the form most natural to his talent.  In some ways,  indeed, it may be held inferior to CHRONICLES AND CHARACTERS;  we look in vain for anything like the terrible intensity of  the night-scene in IRENE, or for any such passages of massive  and memorable writing as appeared, here and there, in the  earlier work, and made it not altogether unworthy of its  model, Hugo&#x27;s LEGEND OF THE AGES.  But it becomes evident, on  the most hasty retrospect, that this earlier work was a step  on the way towards the later.  It seems as if the author had  been feeling about for his definite medium, and was already,  in the language of the child&#x27;s game, growing hot.  There are  many pieces in CHRONICLES AND CHARACTERS that might be  detached from their original setting, and embodied, as they  stand, among the FABLES IN SONG.</p>
<p>For the term Fable is not very easy to define rigorously.  In  the most typical form some moral precept is set forth by  means of a conception purely fantastic, and usually somewhat  trivial into the bargain; there is something playful about  it, that will not support a very exacting criticism, and the  lesson must be apprehended by the fancy at half a hint.  Such  is the great mass of the old stories of wise animals or  foolish men that have amused our childhood.  But we should  expect the fable, in company with other and more important  literary forms, to be more and more loosely, or at least  largely, comprehended as time went on, and so to degenerate  in conception from this original type.  That depended for  much of its piquancy on the very fact that it was fantastic:  the point of the thing lay in a sort of humorous  inappropriateness; and it is natural enough that pleasantry  of this description should become less common, as men learn  to suspect some serious analogy underneath.  Thus a comical  story of an ape touches us quite differently after the  proposition of Mr. Darwin&#x27;s theory.  Moreover, there lay,  perhaps, at the bottom of this primitive sort of fable, a  humanity, a tenderness of rough truths; so that at the end of  some story, in which vice or folly had met with its destined  punishment, the fabulist might be able to assure his  auditors, as we have often to assure tearful children on the  like occasions, that they may dry their eyes, for none of it  was true.</p>
<p>But this benefit of fiction becomes lost with more  sophisticated hearers and authors: a man is no longer the  dupe of his own artifice, and cannot deal playfully with  truths that are a matter of bitter concern to him in his  life.  And hence, in the progressive centralisation of modern  thought, we should expect the old form of fable to fall  gradually into desuetude, and be gradually succeeded by  another, which is a fable in all points except that it is not  altogether fabulous.  And this new form, such as we should  expect, and such as we do indeed find, still presents the  essential character of brevity; as in any other fable also,  there is, underlying and animating the brief action, a moral  idea; and as in any other fable, the object is to bring this  home to the reader through the intellect rather than through  the feelings; so that, without being very deeply moved or  interested by the characters of the piece, we should  recognise vividly the hinges on which the little plot  revolves.  But the fabulist now seeks analogies where before  he merely sought humorous situations.  There will be now a  logical nexus between the moral expressed and the machinery  employed to express it.  The machinery, in fact, as this  change is developed, becomes less and less fabulous.  We find  ourselves in presence of quite a serious, if quite a  miniature division of creative literature; and sometimes we  have the lesson embodied in a sober, everyday narration, as  in the parables of the New Testament, and sometimes merely  the statement or, at most, the collocation of significant  facts in life, the reader being left to resolve for himself  the vague, troublesome, and not yet definitely moral  sentiment which has been thus created.  And step by step with  the development of this change, yet another is developed: the  moral tends to become more indeterminate and large.  It  ceases to be possible to append it, in a tag, to the bottom  of the piece, as one might write the name below a caricature;  and the fable begins to take rank with all other forms of  creative literature, as something too ambitious, in spite of  its miniature dimensions, to be resumed in any succinct  formula without the loss of all that is deepest and most  suggestive in it.</p>
<p>Now it is in this widest sense that Lord Lytton understands  the term; there are examples in his two pleasant volumes of  all the forms already mentioned, and even of another which  can only be admitted among fables by the utmost possible  leniency of construction.  &#x27;Composure,&#x27; &#x27;Et Caetera,&#x27; and  several more, are merely similes poetically elaborated.  So,  too, is the pathetic story of the grandfather and grandchild:  the child, having treasured away an icicle and forgotten it  for ten minutes, comes back to find it already nearly melted,  and no longer beautiful: at the same time, the grandfather  has just remembered and taken out a bundle of love-letters,  which he too had stored away in years gone by, and then long  neglected; and, behold! the letters are as faded and  sorrowfully disappointing as the icicle.  This is merely a  simile poetically worked out; and yet it is in such as these,  and some others, to be mentioned further on, that the author  seems at his best.  Wherever he has really written after the  old model, there is something to be deprecated: in spite of  all the spirit and freshness, in spite of his happy  assumption of that cheerful acceptation of things as they  are, which, rightly or wrongly, we come to attribute to the  ideal fabulist, there is ever a sense as of something a  little out of place.  A form of literature so very innocent  and primitive looks a little over-written in Lord Lytton&#x27;s  conscious and highly-coloured style.  It may be bad taste,  but sometimes we should prefer a few sentences of plain prose  narration, and a little Bewick by way of tail-piece.  So that  it is not among those fables that conform most nearly to the  old model, but one had nearly said among those that most  widely differ from it, that we find the most satisfactory  examples of the author&#x27;s manner.</p>
<p>In the mere matter of ingenuity, the metaphysical fables are  the most remarkable; such as that of the windmill who  imagined that it was he who raised the wind; or that of the  grocer&#x27;s balance (&#x27;Cogito ergo sum&#x27;) who considered himself  endowed with free-will, reason, and an infallible practical  judgment; until, one fine day, the police made a descent upon  the shop, and find the weights false and the scales unequal;  and the whole thing is broken up for old iron.  Capital  fables, also, in the same ironical spirit, are &#x27;Prometheus  Unbound,&#x27; the tale of the vainglorying of a champagne-cork,  and &#x27;Teleology,&#x27; where a nettle justifies the ways of God to  nettles while all goes well with it, and, upon a change of  luck, promptly changes its divinity.</p>
<p>In all these there is still plenty of the fabulous if you  will, although, even here, there may be two opinions  possible; but there is another group, of an order of merit  perhaps still higher, where we look in vain for any such  playful liberties with Nature.  Thus we have &#x27;Conservation of  Force&#x27;; where a musician, thinking of a certain picture,  improvises in the twilight; a poet, hearing the music, goes  home inspired, and writes a poem; and then a painter, under  the influence of this poem, paints another picture, thus  lineally descended from the first.  This is fiction, but not  what we have been used to call fable.  We miss the incredible  element, the point of audacity with which the fabulist was  wont to mock at his readers.  And still more so is this the  case with others.  &#x27;The Horse and the Fly&#x27; states one of the  unanswerable problems of life in quite a realistic and  straightforward way.  A fly startles a cab-horse, the coach  is overset; a newly-married pair within and the driver, a man  with a wife and family, are all killed.  The horse continues  to gallop off in the loose traces, and ends the tragedy by  running over an only child; and there is some little pathetic  detail here introduced in the telling, that makes the  reader&#x27;s indignation very white-hot against some one.  It  remains to be seen who that some one is to be: the fly?  Nay,  but on closer inspection, it appears that the fly, actuated  by maternal instinct, was only seeking a place for her eggs:  is maternal instinct, then, &#x27;sole author of these mischiefs  all&#x27;?  &#x27;Who&#x27;s in the Right?&#x27; one of the best fables in the  book, is somewhat in the same vein.  After a battle has been  won, a group of officers assemble inside a battery, and  debate together who should have the honour of the success;  the Prince, the general staff, the cavalry, the engineer who  posted the battery in which they then stand talking, are  successively named: the sergeant, who pointed the guns,  sneers to himself at the mention of the engineer; and, close  by, the gunner, who had applied the match, passes away with a  smile of triumph, since it was through his hand that the  victorious blow had been dealt.  Meanwhile, the cannon claims  the honour over the gunner; the cannon-ball, who actually  goes forth on the dread mission, claims it over the cannon,  who remains idly behind; the powder reminds the cannon-ball  that, but for him, it would still be lying on the arsenal  floor; and the match caps the discussion; powder, cannon- ball, and cannon would be all equally vain and ineffectual  without fire.  Just then there comes on a shower of rain,  which wets the powder and puts out the match, and completes  this lesson of dependence, by indicating the negative  conditions which are as necessary for any effect, in their  absence, as is the presence of this great fraternity of  positive conditions, not any one of which can claim priority  over any other.  But the fable does not end here, as perhaps,  in all logical strictness, it should.  It wanders off into a  discussion as to which is the truer greatness, that of the  vanquished fire or that of the victorious rain.  And the  speech of the rain is charming:</p>
<p>&#x27;Lo, with my little drops I bless again And beautify the fields which thou didst blast! Rend, wither, waste, and ruin, what thou wilt, But call not Greatness what the Gods call Guilt. Blossoms and grass from blood in battle spilt, And poppied corn, I bring. &#x27;Mid mouldering Babels, to oblivion built, My violets spring. Little by little my small drops have strength To deck with green delights the grateful earth.&#x27;</p>
<p>And so forth, not quite germane (it seems to me) to the  matter in hand, but welcome for its own sake.</p>
<p>Best of all are the fables that deal more immediately with  the emotions.  There is, for instance, that of &#x27;The Two  Travellers,&#x27; which is profoundly moving in conception,  although by no means as well written as some others.  In  this, one of the two, fearfully frost-bitten, saves his life  out of the snow at the cost of all that was comely in his  body; just as, long before, the other, who has now quietly  resigned himself to death, had violently freed himself from  Love at the cost of all that was finest and fairest in his  character.  Very graceful and sweet is the fable (if so it  should be called) in which the author sings the praises of  that &#x27;kindly perspective,&#x27; which lets a wheat-stalk near the  eye cover twenty leagues of distant country, and makes the  humble circle about a man&#x27;s hearth more to him than all the  possibilities of the external world.  The companion fable to  this is also excellent.  It tells us of a man who had, all  his life through, entertained a passion for certain blue  hills on the far horizon, and had promised himself to travel  thither ere he died, and become familiar with these distant  friends.  At last, in some political trouble, he is banished  to the very place of his dreams.  He arrives there overnight,  and, when he rises and goes forth in the morning, there sure  enough are the blue hills, only now they have changed places  with him, and smile across to him, distant as ever, from the  old home whence he has come.  Such a story might have been  very cynically treated; but it is not so done, the whole tone  is kindly and consolatory, and the disenchanted man  submissively takes the lesson, and understands that things  far away are to be loved for their own sake, and that the  unattainable is not truly unattainable, when we can make the  beauty of it our own.  Indeed, throughout all these two  volumes, though there is much practical scepticism, and much  irony on abstract questions, this kindly and consolatory  spirit is never absent.  There is much that is cheerful and,  after a sedate, fireside fashion, hopeful.  No one will be  discouraged by reading the book; but the ground of all this  hopefulness and cheerfulness remains to the end somewhat  vague.  It does not seem to arise from any practical belief  in the future either of the individual or the race, but  rather from the profound personal contentment of the writer.   This is, I suppose, all we must look for in the case.  It is  as much as we can expect, if the fabulist shall prove a  shrewd and cheerful fellow-wayfarer, one with whom the world  does not seem to have gone much amiss, but who has yet  laughingly learned something of its evil.  It will depend  much, of course, upon our own character and circumstances,  whether the encounter will be agreeable and bracing to the  spirits, or offend us as an ill-timed mockery.  But where, as  here, there is a little tincture of bitterness along with the  good-nature, where it is plainly not the humour of a man  cheerfully ignorant, but of one who looks on, tolerant and  superior and smilingly attentive, upon the good and bad of  our existence, it will go hardly if we do not catch some  reflection of the same spirit to help us on our way.  There  is here no impertinent and lying proclamation of peace - none  of the cheap optimism of the well-to-do; what we find here is  a view of life that would be even grievous, were it not  enlivened with this abiding cheerfulness, and ever and anon  redeemed by a stroke of pathos.</p>
<p>It is natural enough, I suppose, that we should find wanting  in this book some of the intenser qualities of the author&#x27;s  work; and their absence is made up for by much happy  description after a quieter fashion.  The burst of jubilation  over the departure of the snow, which forms the prelude to  &#x27;The Thistle,&#x27; is full of spirit and of pleasant images.  The  speech of the forest in &#x27;Sans Souci&#x27; is inspired by a  beautiful sentiment for nature of the modern sort, and  pleases us more, I think, as poetry should please us, than  anything in CHRONICLES AND CHARACTERS.  There are some  admirable felicities of expression here and there; as that of  the hill, whose summit</p>
<p>&#x27;Did print The azure air with pines.&#x27;</p>
<p>Moreover, I do not recollect in the author&#x27;s former work any  symptom of that sympathetic treatment of still life, which is  noticeable now and again in the fables; and perhaps most  noticeably, when he sketches the burned letters as they hover  along the gusty flue, &#x27;Thin, sable veils, wherein a restless  spark Yet trembled.&#x27;  But the description is at its best when  the subjects are unpleasant, or even grisly.  There are a few  capital lines in this key on the last spasm of the battle  before alluded to.  Surely nothing could be better, in its  own way, than the fish in &#x27;The Last Cruise of the Arrogant,&#x27;  &#x27;the shadowy, side-faced, silent things,&#x27; that come butting  and staring with lidless eyes at the sunken steam-engine.   And although, in yet another, we are told, pleasantly enough,  how the water went down into the valleys, where it set itself  gaily to saw wood, and on into the plains, where it would  soberly carry grain to town; yet the real strength of the  fable is when it dealt with the shut pool in which certain  unfortunate raindrops are imprisoned among slugs and snails,  and in the company of an old toad.  The sodden contentment of  the fallen acorn is strangely significant; and it is  astonishing how unpleasantly we are startled by the  appearance of her horrible lover, the maggot.</p>
<p>And now for a last word, about the style.  This is not easy  to criticise.  It is impossible to deny to it rapidity,  spirit, and a full sound; the lines are never lame, and the  sense is carried forward with an uninterrupted, impetuous  rush.  But it is not equal.  After passages of really  admirable versification, the author falls back upon a sort of  loose, cavalry manner, not unlike the style of some of Mr.  Browning&#x27;s minor pieces, and almost inseparable from  wordiness, and an easy acceptation of somewhat cheap finish.   There is nothing here of that compression which is the note  of a really sovereign style.  It is unfair, perhaps, to set a  not remarkable passage from Lord Lytton side by side with one  of the signal masterpieces of another, and a very perfect  poet; and yet it is interesting, when we see how the  portraiture of a dog, detailed through thirty odd lines, is  frittered down and finally almost lost in the mere laxity of  the style, to compare it with the clear, simple, vigorous  delineation that Burns, in four couplets, has given us of the  ploughman&#x27;s collie.  It is interesting, at first, and then it  becomes a little irritating; for when we think of other  passages so much more finished and adroit, we cannot help  feeling, that with a little more ardour after perfection of  form, criticism would have found nothing left for her to  censure.  A similar mark of precipitate work is the number of  adjectives tumultuously heaped together, sometimes to help  out the sense, and sometimes (as one cannot but suspect) to  help out the sound of the verses.  I do not believe, for  instance, that Lord Lytton himself would defend the lines in  which we are told how Laocoon &#x27;Revealed to Roman crowds, now  CHRISTIAN grown, That PAGAN anguish which, in PARIAN stone,  The RHODIAN artist,&#x27; and so on.  It is not only that this is  bad in itself; but that it is unworthy of the company in  which it is found; that such verses should not have appeared  with the name of a good versifier like Lord Lytton.  We must  take exception, also, in conclusion, to the excess of  alliteration.  Alliteration is so liable to be abused that we  can scarcely be too sparing of it; and yet it is a trick that  seems to grow upon the author with years.  It is a pity to  see fine verses, such as some in &#x27;Demos,&#x27; absolutely spoiled  by the recurrence of one wearisome consonant.</p>
<p>CRITICISMS CHAPTER II - SALVINI&#x27;S MACBETH</p>
<p>SALVINI closed his short visit to Edinburgh by a performance  of MACBETH.  It was, perhaps, from a sentiment of local  colour that he chose to play the Scottish usurper for the  first time before Scotsmen; and the audience were not  insensible of the privilege.  Few things, indeed, can move a  stronger interest than to see a great creation taking shape  for the first time.  If it is not purely artistic, the  sentiment is surely human.  And the thought that you are  before all the world, and have the start of so many others as  eager as yourself, at least keeps you in a more unbearable  suspense before the curtain rises, if it does not enhance the  delight with which you follow the performance and see the  actor &#x27;bend up each corporal agent&#x27; to realise a masterpiece  of a few hours&#x27; duration.  With a player so variable as  Salvini, who trusts to the feelings of the moment for so much  detail, and who, night after night, does the same thing  differently but always well, it can never be safe to pass  judgment after a single hearing.  And this is more  particularly true of last week&#x27;s MACBETH; for the whole third  act was marred by a grievously humorous misadventure.   Several minutes too soon the ghost of Banquo joined the  party, and after having sat helpless a while at a table, was  ignominiously withdrawn.  Twice was this ghostly Jack-in-the- box obtruded on the stage before his time; twice removed  again; and yet he showed so little hurry when he was really  wanted, that, after an awkward pause, Macbeth had to begin  his apostrophe to empty air.  The arrival of the belated  spectre in the middle, with a jerk that made him nod all  over, was the last accident in the chapter, and worthily  topped the whole.  It may be imagined how lamely matters went  throughout these cross purposes.</p>
<p>In spite of this, and some other hitches, Salvini&#x27;s Macbeth  had an emphatic success.  The creation is worthy of a place  beside the same artist&#x27;s Othello and Hamlet.  It is the  simplest and most unsympathetic of the three; but the absence  of the finer lineaments of Hamlet is redeemed by gusto,  breadth, and a headlong unity.  Salvini sees nothing great in  Macbeth beyond the royalty of muscle, and that courage which  comes of strong and copious circulation.  The moral smallness  of the man is insisted on from the first, in the shudder of  uncontrollable jealousy with which he sees Duncan embracing  Banquo.  He may have some northern poetry of speech, but he  has not much logical understanding.  In his dealings with the  supernatural powers he is like a savage with his fetich,  trusting them beyond bounds while all goes well, and whenever  he is crossed, casting his belief aside and calling &#x27;fate  into the list.&#x27;  For his wife, he is little more than an  agent, a frame of bone and sinew for her fiery spirit to  command.  The nature of his feeling towards her is rendered  with a most precise and delicate touch.  He always yields to  the woman&#x27;s fascination; and yet his caresses (and we know  how much meaning Salvini can give to a caress) are singularly  hard and unloving.  Sometimes he lays his hand on her as he  might take hold of any one who happened to be nearest to him  at a moment of excitement.  Love has fallen out of this  marriage by the way, and left a curious friendship.  Only  once - at the very moment when she is showing herself so  little a woman and so much a high-spirited man - only once is  he very deeply stirred towards her; and that finds expression  in the strange and horrible transport of admiration, doubly  strange and horrible on Salvini&#x27;s lips - &#x27;Bring forth men- children only!&#x27;</p>
<p>The murder scene, as was to be expected, pleased the audience  best.  Macbeth&#x27;s voice, in the talk with his wife, was a  thing not to be forgotten; and when he spoke of his hangman&#x27;s  hands he seemed to have blood in his utterance.  Never for a  moment, even in the very article of the murder, does he  possess his own soul.  He is a man on wires.  From first to  last it is an exhibition of hideous cowardice.  For, after  all, it is not here, but in broad daylight, with the  exhilaration of conflict, where he can assure himself at  every blow he has the longest sword and the heaviest hand,  that this man&#x27;s physical bravery can keep him up; he is an  unwieldy ship, and needs plenty of way on before he will  steer.</p>
<p>In the banquet scene, while the first murderer gives account  of what he has done, there comes a flash of truculent joy at  the &#x27;twenty trenched gashes&#x27; on Banquo&#x27;s head.  Thus Macbeth  makes welcome to his imagination those very details of  physical horror which are so soon to turn sour in him.  As he  runs out to embrace these cruel circumstances, as he seeks to  realise to his mind&#x27;s eye the reassuring spectacle of his  dead enemy, he is dressing out the phantom to terrify  himself; and his imagination, playing the part of justice, is  to &#x27;commend to his own lips the ingredients of his poisoned  chalice.&#x27;  With the recollection of Hamlet and his father&#x27;s  spirit still fresh upon him, and the holy awe with which that  good man encountered things not dreamt of in his philosophy,  it was not possible to avoid looking for resemblances between  the two apparitions and the two men haunted.  But there are  none to be found.  Macbeth has a purely physical dislike for  Banquo&#x27;s spirit and the &#x27;twenty trenched gashes.&#x27;  He is  afraid of he knows not what.  He is abject, and again  blustering.  In the end he so far forgets himself, his  terror, and the nature of what is before him, that he rushes  upon it as he would upon a man.  When his wife tells him he  needs repose, there is something really childish in the way  he looks about the room, and, seeing nothing, with an  expression of almost sensual relief, plucks up heart enough  to go to bed.  And what is the upshot of the visitation?  It  is written in Shakespeare, but should be read with the  commentary of Salvini&#x27;s voice and expression:- &#x27;O! SIAM NELL&#x27;  OPRA ANCOR FANCIULLI&#x27; -  &#x27;We are yet but young in deed.&#x27;   Circle below circle.  He is looking with horrible  satisfaction into the mouth of hell.  There may still be a  prick to-day; but to-morrow conscience will be dead, and he  may move untroubled in this element of blood.</p>
<p>In the fifth act we see this lowest circle reached; and it is  Salvini&#x27;s finest moment throughout the play.  From the first  he was admirably made up, and looked Macbeth to the full as  perfectly as ever he looked Othello.  From the first moment  he steps upon the stage you can see this character is a  creation to the fullest meaning of the phrase; for the man  before you is a type you know well already.  He arrives with  Banquo on the heath, fair and red-bearded, sparing of  gesture, full of pride and the sense of animal wellbeing, and  satisfied after the battle like a beast who has eaten his  fill.  But in the fifth act there is a change.  This is still  the big, burly, fleshly, handsome-looking Thane; here is  still the same face which in the earlier acts could be  superficially good-humoured and sometimes royally courteous.   But now the atmosphere of blood, which pervades the whole  tragedy, has entered into the man and subdued him to its own  nature; and an indescribable degradation, a slackness and  puffiness, has overtaken his features.  He has breathed the  air of carnage, and supped full of horrors.  Lady Macbeth  complains of the smell of blood on her hand: Macbeth makes no  complaint - he has ceased to notice it now; but the same  smell is in his nostrils.  A contained fury and disgust  possesses him.  He taunts the messenger and the doctor as  people would taunt their mortal enemies.  And, indeed, as he  knows right well, every one is his enemy now, except his  wife.  About her he questions the doctor with something like  a last human anxiety; and, in tones of grisly mystery, asks  him if he can &#x27;minister to a mind diseased.&#x27;  When the news  of her death is brought him, he is staggered and falls into a  seat; but somehow it is not anything we can call grief that  he displays.  There had been two of them against God and man;  and now, when there is only one, it makes perhaps less  difference than he had expected.  And so her death is not  only an affliction, but one more disillusion; and he  redoubles in bitterness.  The speech that follows, given with  tragic cynicism in every word, is a dirge, not so much for  her as for himself.  From that time forth there is nothing  human left in him, only &#x27;the fiend of Scotland,&#x27; Macduff&#x27;s  &#x27;hell-hound,&#x27; whom, with a stern glee, we see baited like a  bear and hunted down like a wolf.  He is inspired and set  above fate by a demoniacal energy, a lust of wounds and  slaughter.  Even after he meets Macduff his courage does not  fail; but when he hears the Thane was not born of woman, all  virtue goes out of him; and though he speaks sounding words  of defiance, the last combat is little better than a suicide.</p>
<p>The whole performance is, as I said, so full of gusto and a  headlong unity; the personality of Macbeth is so sharp and  powerful; and within these somewhat narrow limits there is so  much play and saliency that, so far as concerns Salvini  himself, a third great success seems indubitable.   Unfortunately, however, a great actor cannot fill more than a  very small fraction of the boards; and though Banquo&#x27;s ghost  will probably be more seasonable in his future apparitions,  there are some more inherent difficulties in the piece.  The  company at large did not distinguish themselves.  Macduff, to  the huge delight of the gallery, out-Macduff&#x27;d the average  ranter.  The lady who filled the principal female part has  done better on other occasions, but I fear she has not metal  for what she tried last week.  Not to succeed in the sleep- walking scene is to make a memorable failure.  As it was  given, it succeeded in being wrong in art without being true  to nature.</p>
<p>And there is yet another difficulty, happily easy to reform,  which somewhat interfered with the success of the  performance.  At the end of the incantation scene the Italian  translator has made Macbeth fall insensible upon the stage.   This is a change of questionable propriety from a  psychological point of view; while in point of view of effect  it leaves the stage for some moments empty of all business.   To remedy this, a bevy of green ballet-girls came forth and  pointed their toes about the prostrate king.  A dance of High  Church curates, or a hornpipe by Mr. T. P. Cooke, would not  be more out of the key; though the gravity of a Scots  audience was not to be overcome, and they merely expressed  their disapprobation by a round of moderate hisses, a similar  irruption of Christmas fairies would most likely convulse a  London theatre from pit to gallery with inextinguishable  laughter.  It is, I am told, the Italian tradition; but it is  one more honoured in the breach than the observance.  With  the total disappearance of these damsels, with a stronger  Lady Macbeth, and, if possible, with some compression of  those scenes in which Salvini does not appear, and the  spectator is left at the mercy of Macduffs and Duncans, the  play would go twice as well, and we should be better able to  follow and enjoy an admirable work of dramatic art.</p>
<p>CRITICISMS CHAPTER III - BAGSTER&#x27;S &#x27;PILGRIM&#x27;S PROGRESS&#x27;</p>
<p>I HAVE here before me an edition of the PILGRIM&#x27;S PROGRESS,  bound in green, without a date, and described as &#x27;illustrated  by nearly three hundred engravings, and memoir of Bunyan.&#x27;   On the outside it is lettered &#x27;Bagster&#x27;s Illustrated  Edition,&#x27; and after the author&#x27;s apology, facing the first  page of the tale, a folding pictorial &#x27;Plan of the Road&#x27; is  marked as &#x27;drawn by the late Mr. T. Conder,&#x27; and engraved by  J. Basire.  No further information is anywhere vouchsafed;  perhaps the publishers had judged the work too unimportant;  and we are still left ignorant whether or not we owe the  woodcuts in the body of the volume to the same hand that drew  the plan.  It seems, however, more than probable.  The  literal particularity of mind which, in the map, laid down  the flower-plots in the devil&#x27;s garden, and carefully  introduced the court-house in the town of Vanity, is closely  paralleled in many of the cuts; and in both, the architecture  of the buildings and the disposition of the gardens have a  kindred and entirely English air.  Whoever he was, the author  of these wonderful little pictures may lay claim to be the  best illustrator of Bunyan.  They are not only good  illustrations, like so many others; but they are like so few,  good illustrations of Bunyan.  Their spirit, in defect and  quality, is still the same as his own.  The designer also has  lain down and dreamed a dream, as literal, as quaint, and  almost as apposite as Bunyan&#x27;s; and text and pictures make  but the two sides of the same homespun yet impassioned story.   To do justice to the designs, it will be necessary to say,  for the hundredth time, a word or two about the masterpiece  which they adorn.</p>
<p>All allegories have a tendency to escape from the purpose of  their creators; and as the characters and incidents become  more and more interesting in themselves, the moral, which  these were to show forth, falls more and more into neglect.   An architect may command a wreath of vine-leaves round the  cornice of a monument; but if, as each leaf came from the  chisel, it took proper life and fluttered freely on the wall,  and if the vine grew, and the building were hidden over with  foliage and fruit, the architect would stand in much the same  situation as the writer of allegories.  The FAERY QUEEN was  an allegory, I am willing to believe; but it survives as an  imaginative tale in incomparable verse.  The case of Bunyan  is widely different; and yet in this also Allegory, poor  nymph, although never quite forgotten, is sometimes rudely  thrust against the wall.  Bunyan was fervently in earnest;  with &#x27;his fingers in his ears, he ran on,&#x27; straight for his  mark.  He tells us himself, in the conclusion to the first  part, that he did not fear to raise a laugh; indeed, he  feared nothing, and said anything; and he was greatly served  in this by a certain rustic privilege of his style, which,  like the talk of strong uneducated men, when it does not  impress by its force, still charms by its simplicity.  The  mere story and the allegorical design enjoyed perhaps his  equal favour.  He believed in both with an energy of faith  that was capable of moving mountains.  And we have to remark  in him, not the parts where inspiration fails and is supplied  by cold and merely decorative invention, but the parts where  faith has grown to be credulity, and his characters become so  real to him that he forgets the end of their creation.  We  can follow him step by step into the trap which he lays for  himself by his own entire good faith and triumphant  literality of vision, till the trap closes and shuts him in  an inconsistency.  The allegories of the Interpreter and of  the Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains are all actually  performed, like stage-plays, before the pilgrims.  The son of  Mr. Great-grace visibly &#x27;tumbles hills about with his words.&#x27;   Adam the First has his condemnation written visibly on his  forehead, so that Faithful reads it.  At the very instant the  net closes round the pilgrims, &#x27;the white robe falls from the  black man&#x27;s body.&#x27;  Despair &#x27;getteth him a grievous crab-tree  cudgel&#x27;; it was in &#x27;sunshiny weather&#x27; that he had his fits;  and the birds in the grove about the House Beautiful, &#x27;our  country birds,&#x27; only sing their little pious verses &#x27;at the  spring, when the flowers appear and the sun shines warm.&#x27;  &#x27;I  often,&#x27; says Piety, &#x27;go out to hear them; we also ofttimes  keep them tame on our house.&#x27;  The post between Beulah and  the Celestial City sounds his horn, as you may yet hear in  country places.  Madam Bubble, that &#x27;tall, comely dame,  something of a swarthy complexion, in very pleasant attire,  but old,&#x27; &#x27;gives you a smile at the end of each sentence&#x27; - a  real woman she; we all know her.  Christiana dying &#x27;gave Mr.  Stand-fast a ring,&#x27; for no possible reason in the allegory,  merely because the touch was human and affecting.  Look at  Great-heart, with his soldierly ways, garrison ways, as I had  almost called them; with his taste in weapons; his delight in  any that &#x27;he found to be a man of his hands&#x27;; his chivalrous  point of honour, letting Giant Maul get up again when he was  down, a thing fairly flying in the teeth of the moral; above  all, with his language in the inimitable tale of Mr. Fearing:  &#x27;I thought I should have lost my man&#x27; - &#x27;chicken-hearted&#x27; -  &#x27;at last he came in, and I will say that for my lord, he  carried it wonderful lovingly to him.&#x27;  This is no  Independent minister; this is a stout, honest, big-busted  ancient, adjusting his shoulder-belts, twirling his long  moustaches as he speaks.  Last and most remarkable, &#x27;My  sword,&#x27; says the dying Valiant-for-Truth, he in whom Great- heart delighted, &#x27;my sword I give to him that shall succeed  me in my pilgrimage, AND MY COURAGE AND SKILL TO HIM THAT CAN  GET IT.&#x27;  And after this boast, more arrogantly unorthodox  than was ever dreamed of by the rejected Ignorance, we are  told that &#x27;all the trumpets sounded for him on the other  side.&#x27;</p>
<p>In every page the book is stamped with the same energy of  vision and the same energy of belief.  The quality is equally  and indifferently displayed in the spirit of the fighting,  the tenderness of the pathos, the startling vigour and  strangeness of the incidents, the natural strain of the  conversations, and the humanity and charm of the characters.   Trivial talk over a meal, the dying words of heroes, the  delights of Beulah or the Celestial City, Apollyon and my  Lord Hate-good, Great-heart, and Mr. Worldly-Wiseman, all  have been imagined with the same clearness, all written of  with equal gusto and precision, all created in the same mixed  element, of simplicity that is almost comical, and art that,  for its purpose, is faultless.</p>
<p>It was in much the same spirit that our artist sat down to  his drawings.  He is by nature a Bunyan of the pencil.  He,  too, will draw anything, from a butcher at work on a dead  sheep, up to the courts of Heaven.  &#x27;A Lamb for Supper&#x27; is  the name of one of his designs, &#x27;Their Glorious Entry&#x27; of  another.  He has the same disregard for the ridiculous, and  enjoys somewhat of the same privilege of style, so that we  are pleased even when we laugh the most.  He is literal to  the verge of folly.  If dust is to be raised from the unswept  parlour, you may be sure it will &#x27;fly abundantly&#x27; in the  picture.  If Faithful is to lie &#x27;as dead&#x27; before Moses, dead  he shall lie with a warrant - dead and stiff like granite;  nay (and here the artist must enhance upon the symbolism of  the author), it is with the identical stone tables of the law  that Moses fells the sinner.  Good and bad people, whom we at  once distinguish in the text by their names, Hopeful, Honest,  and Valiant-for-Truth, on the one hand, as against By-ends,  Sir Having Greedy, and the Lord Old-man on the other, are in  these drawings as simply distinguished by their costume.   Good people, when not armed CAP-A-PIE, wear a speckled tunic  girt about the waist, and low hats, apparently of straw.  Bad  people swagger in tail-coats and chimney-pots, a few with  knee-breeches, but the large majority in trousers, and for  all the world like guests at a garden-party.  Worldly-Wiseman  alone, by some inexplicable quirk, stands before Christian in  laced hat, embroidered waistcoat, and trunk-hose.  But above  all examples of this artist&#x27;s intrepidity, commend me to the  print entitled &#x27;Christian Finds it Deep.&#x27;  &#x27;A great darkness  and horror,&#x27; says the text, have fallen on the pilgrim; it is  the comfortless deathbed with which Bunyan so strikingly  concludes the sorrows and conflicts of his hero.  How to  represent this worthily the artist knew not; and yet he was  determined to represent it somehow.  This was how he did:  Hopeful is still shown to his neck above the water of death;  but Christian has bodily disappeared, and a blot of solid  blackness indicates his place.</p>
<p>As you continue to look at these pictures, about an inch  square for the most part, sometimes printed three or more to  the page, and each having a printed legend of its own,  however trivial the event recorded, you will soon become  aware of two things: first, that the man can draw, and,  second, that he possesses the gift of an imagination.   &#x27;Obstinate reviles,&#x27; says the legend; and you should see  Obstinate reviling.  &#x27;He warily retraces his steps&#x27;; and  there is Christian, posting through the plain, terror and  speed in every muscle.  &#x27;Mercy yearns to go&#x27; shows you a  plain interior with packing going forward, and, right in the  middle, Mercy yearning to go - every line of the girl&#x27;s  figure yearning.  In &#x27;The Chamber called Peace&#x27; we see a  simple English room, bed with white curtains, window valance  and door, as may be found in many thousand unpretentious  houses; but far off, through the open window, we behold the  sun uprising out of a great plain, and Christian hails it  with his hand:</p>
<p>&#x27;Where am I now! is this the love and care Of Jesus, for the men that pilgrims are! Thus to provide!  That I should be forgiven! And dwell already the next door to heaven!&#x27;</p>
<p>A page or two further, from the top of the House Beautiful,  the damsels point his gaze toward the Delectable Mountains:  &#x27;The Prospect,&#x27; so the cut is ticketed - and I shall be  surprised, if on less than a square inch of paper you can  show me one so wide and fair.  Down a cross road on an  English plain, a cathedral city outlined on the horizon, a  hazel shaw upon the left, comes Madam Wanton dancing with her  fair enchanted cup, and Faithful, book in hand, half pauses.   The cut is perfect as a symbol; the giddy movement of the  sorceress, the uncertain poise of the man struck to the heart  by a temptation, the contrast of that even plain of life  whereon he journeys with the bold, ideal bearing of the  wanton - the artist who invented and portrayed this had not  merely read Bunyan, he had also thoughtfully lived.  The  Delectable Mountains - I continue skimming the first part -  are not on the whole happily rendered.  Once, and once only,  the note is struck, when Christian and Hopeful are seen  coming, shoulder-high, through a thicket of green shrubs -  box, perhaps, or perfumed nutmeg; while behind them, domed or  pointed, the hills stand ranged against the sky.  A little  further, and we come to that masterpiece of Bunyan&#x27;s insight  into life, the Enchanted Ground; where, in a few traits, he  has set down the latter end of such a number of the would-be  good; where his allegory goes so deep that, to people looking  seriously on life, it cuts like satire.  The true  significance of this invention lies, of course, far out of  the way of drawing; only one feature, the great tedium of the  land, the growing weariness in well-doing, may be somewhat  represented in a symbol.  The pilgrims are near the end: &#x27;Two  Miles Yet,&#x27; says the legend.  The road goes ploughing up and  down over a rolling heath; the wayfarers, with outstretched  arms, are already sunk to the knees over the brow of the  nearest hill; they have just passed a milestone with the  cipher two; from overhead a great, piled, summer cumulus, as  of a slumberous summer afternoon, beshadows them: two miles!  it might be hundreds.  In dealing with the Land of Beulah the  artist lags, in both parts, miserably behind the text, but in  the distant prospect of the Celestial City more than regains  his own.  You will remember when Christian and Hopeful &#x27;with  desire fell sick.&#x27;  &#x27;Effect of the Sunbeams&#x27; is the artist&#x27;s  title.  Against the sky, upon a cliffy mountain, the radiant  temple beams upon them over deep, subjacent woods; they,  behind a mound, as if seeking shelter from the splendour -  one prostrate on his face, one kneeling, and with hands  ecstatically lifted - yearn with passion after that immortal  city.  Turn the page, and we behold them walking by the very  shores of death; Heaven, from this nigher view, has risen  half-way to the zenith, and sheds a wider glory; and the two  pilgrims, dark against that brightness, walk and sing out of  the fulness of their hearts.  No cut more thoroughly  illustrates at once the merit and the weakness of the artist.   Each pilgrim sings with a book in his grasp - a family Bible  at the least for bigness; tomes so recklessly enormous that  our second, impulse is to laughter.  And yet that is not the  first thought, nor perhaps the last.  Something in the  attitude of the manikins - faces they have none, they are too  small for that - something in the way they swing these  monstrous volumes to their singing, something perhaps  borrowed from the text, some subtle differentiation from the  cut that went before and the cut that follows after -  something, at least, speaks clearly of a fearful joy, of  Heaven seen from the deathbed, of the horror of the last  passage no less than of the glorious coming home.  There is  that in the action of one of them which always reminds me,  with a difference, of that haunting last glimpse of Thomas  Idle, travelling to Tyburn in the cart.  Next come the  Shining Ones, wooden and trivial enough; the pilgrims pass  into the river; the blot already mentioned settles over and  obliterates Christian.  In two more cuts we behold them  drawing nearer to the other shore; and then, between two  radiant angels, one of whom points upward, we see them  mounting in new weeds, their former lendings left behind them  on the inky river.  More angels meet them; Heaven is  displayed, and if no better, certainly no worse, than it has  been shown by others - a place, at least, infinitely populous  and glorious with light - a place that haunts solemnly the  hearts of children.  And then this symbolic draughtsman once  more strikes into his proper vein.  Three cuts conclude the  first part.  In the first the gates close, black against the  glory struggling from within.  The second shows us Ignorance  - alas! poor Arminian! - hailing, in a sad twilight, the  ferryman Vain-Hope; and in the third we behold him, bound  hand and foot, and black already with the hue of his eternal  fate, carried high over the mountain-tops of the world by two  angels of the anger of the Lord.  &#x27;Carried to Another Place,&#x27;  the artist enigmatically names his plate - a terrible design.</p>
<p>Wherever he touches on the black side of the supernatural his  pencil grows more daring and incisive.  He has many true  inventions in the perilous and diabolic; he has many  startling nightmares realised.  It is not easy to select the  best; some may like one and some another; the nude, depilated  devil bounding and casting darts against the Wicket Gate; the  scroll of flying horrors that hang over Christian by the  Mouth of Hell; the horned shade that comes behind him  whispering blasphemies; the daylight breaking through that  rent cave-mouth of the mountains and falling chill adown the  haunted tunnel; Christian&#x27;s further progress along the  causeway, between the two black pools, where, at every yard  or two, a gin, a pitfall, or a snare awaits the passer-by -  loathsome white devilkins harbouring close under the bank to  work the springes, Christian himself pausing and pricking  with his sword&#x27;s point at the nearest noose, and pale  discomfortable mountains rising on the farther side; or yet  again, the two ill-favoured ones that beset the first of  Christian&#x27;s journey, with the frog-like structure of the  skull, the frog-like limberness of limbs - crafty, slippery,  lustful-looking devils, drawn always in outline as though  possessed of a dim, infernal luminosity.  Horrid fellows are  they, one and all; horrid fellows and horrific scenes.  In  another spirit that Good-Conscience &#x27;to whom Mr. Honest had  spoken in his lifetime,&#x27; a cowled, grey, awful figure, one  hand pointing to the heavenly shore, realises, I will not say  all, but some at least of the strange impressiveness of  Bunyan&#x27;s words.  It is no easy nor pleasant thing to speak in  one&#x27;s lifetime with Good-Conscience; he is an austere,  unearthly friend, whom maybe Torquemada knew; and the folds  of his raiment are not merely claustral, but have something  of the horror of the pall.  Be not afraid, however; with the  hand of that appearance Mr. Honest will get safe across.</p>
<p>Yet perhaps it is in sequences that this artist best displays  himself.  He loves to look at either side of a thing: as, for  instance, when he shows us both sides of the wall - &#x27;Grace  Inextinguishable&#x27; on the one side, with the devil vainly  pouring buckets on the flame, and &#x27;The Oil of Grace&#x27; on the  other, where the Holy Spirit, vessel in hand, still secretly  supplies the fire.  He loves, also, to show us the same event  twice over, and to repeat his instantaneous photographs at  the interval of but a moment.  So we have, first, the whole  troop of pilgrims coming up to Valiant, and Great-heart to  the front, spear in hand and parleying; and next, the same  cross-roads, from a more distant view, the convoy now  scattered and looking safely and curiously on, and Valiant  handing over for inspection his &#x27;right Jerusalem blade.&#x27;  It  is true that this designer has no great care after  consistency: Apollyon&#x27;s spear is laid by, his quiver of darts  will disappear, whenever they might hinder the designer&#x27;s  freedom; and the fiend&#x27;s tail is blobbed or forked at his  good pleasure.  But this is not unsuitable to the  illustration of the fervent Bunyan, breathing hurry and  momentary inspiration.  He, with his hot purpose, hunting  sinners with a lasso, shall himself forget the things that he  has written yesterday.  He shall first slay Heedless in the  Valley of the Shadow, and then take leave of him talking in  his sleep, as if nothing had happened, in an arbour on the  Enchanted Ground.  And again, in his rhymed prologue, he  shall assign some of the glory of the siege of Doubting  Castle to his favourite Valiant-for-the-Truth, who did not  meet with the besiegers till long after, at that dangerous  corner by Deadman&#x27;s Lane.  And, with all inconsistencies and  freedoms, there is a power shown in these sequences of cuts:  a power of joining on one action or one humour to another; a  power of following out the moods, even of the dismal  subterhuman fiends engendered by the artist&#x27;s fancy; a power  of sustained continuous realisation, step by step, in  nature&#x27;s order, that can tell a story, in all its ins and  outs, its pauses and surprises, fully and figuratively, like  the art of words.</p>
<p>One such sequence is the fight of Christian and Apollyon -  six cuts, weird and fiery, like the text.  The pilgrim is  throughout a pale and stockish figure; but the devil covers a  multitude of defects.  There is no better devil of the  conventional order than our artist&#x27;s Apollyon, with his mane,  his wings, his bestial legs, his changing and terrifying  expression, his infernal energy to slay.  In cut the first  you see him afar off, still obscure in form, but already  formidable in suggestion.  Cut the second, &#x27;The Fiend in  Discourse,&#x27; represents him, not reasoning, railing rather,  shaking his spear at the pilgrim, his shoulder advanced, his  tail writhing in the air, his foot ready for a spring, while  Christian stands back a little, timidly defensive.  The third  illustrates these magnificent words: &#x27;Then Apollyon straddled  quite over the whole breadth of the way, and said, I am void  of fear in this matter: prepare thyself to die; for I swear  by my infernal den that thou shalt go no farther: here will I  spill thy soul!  And with that he threw a flaming dart at his  breast.&#x27;  In the cut he throws a dart with either hand,  belching pointed flames out of his mouth, spreading his broad  vans, and straddling the while across the path, as only a  fiend can straddle who has just sworn by his infernal den.   The defence will not be long against such vice, such flames,  such red-hot nether energy.  And in the fourth cut, to be  sure, he has leaped bodily upon his victim, sped by foot and  pinion, and roaring as he leaps.  The fifth shows the  climacteric of the battle; Christian has reached nimbly out  and got his sword, and dealt that deadly home-thrust, the  fiend still stretched upon him, but &#x27;giving back, as one that  had received his mortal wound.&#x27;  The raised head, the  bellowing mouth, the paw clapped upon the sword, the one wing  relaxed in agony, all realise vividly these words of the  text.  In the sixth and last, the trivial armed figure of the  pilgrim is seen kneeling with clasped hands on the betrodden  scene of contest and among the shivers of the darts; while  just at the margin the hinder quarters and the tail of  Apollyon are whisking off, indignant and discounted.</p>
<p>In one point only do these pictures seem to be unworthy of  the text, and that point is one rather of the difference of  arts than the difference of artists.  Throughout his best and  worst, in his highest and most divine imaginations as in the  narrowest sallies of his sectarianism, the human-hearted  piety of Bunyan touches and ennobles, convinces, accuses the  reader.  Through no art beside the art of words can the  kindness of a man&#x27;s affections be expressed.  In the cuts you  shall find faithfully parodied the quaintness and the power,  the triviality and the surprising freshness of the author&#x27;s  fancy; there you shall find him out-stripped in ready  symbolism and the art of bringing things essentially  invisible before the eyes: but to feel the contact of  essential goodness, to be made in love with piety, the book  must be read and not the prints examined.</p>
<p>Farewell should not be taken with a grudge; nor can I dismiss  in any other words than those of gratitude a series of  pictures which have, to one at least, been the visible  embodiment of Bunyan from childhood up, and shown him,  through all his years, Great-heart lungeing at Giant Maul,  and Apollyon breathing fire at Christian, and every turn and  town along the road to the Celestial City, and that bright  place itself, seen as to a stave of music, shining afar off  upon the hill-top, the candle of the world.</p>
<p>SKETCHES CHAPTER I - THE SATIRIST</p>
<p>MY companion enjoyed a cheap reputation for wit and insight.   He was by habit and repute a satirist.  If he did  occasionally condemn anything or anybody who richly deserved  it, and whose demerits had hitherto escaped, it was simply  because he condemned everything and everybody.  While I was  with him he disposed of St. Paul with an epigram, shook my  reverence for Shakespeare in a neat antithesis, and fell foul  of the Almighty Himself, on the score of one or two out of  the ten commandments.  Nothing escaped his blighting censure.   At every sentence he overthrew an idol, or lowered my  estimation of a friend.  I saw everything with new eyes, and  could only marvel at my former blindness.  How was it  possible that I had not before observed A&#x27;s false hair, B&#x27;s  selfishness, or C&#x27;s boorish manners?  I and my companion,  methought, walked the streets like a couple of gods among a  swarm of vermin; for every one we saw seemed to bear openly  upon his brow the mark of the apocalyptic beast.  I half  expected that these miserable beings, like the people of  Lystra, would recognise their betters and force us to the  altar; in which case, warned by the late of Paul and  Barnabas, I do not know that my modesty would have prevailed  upon me to decline.  But there was no need for such churlish  virtue.  More blinded than the Lycaonians, the people saw no  divinity in our gait; and as our temporary godhead lay more  in the way of observing than healing their infirmities, we  were content to pass them by in scorn.</p>
<p>I could not leave my companion, not from regard or even from  interest, but from a very natural feeling, inseparable from  the case.  To understand it, let us take a simile.  Suppose  yourself walking down the street with a man who continues to  sprinkle the crowd out of a flask of vitriol.  You would be  much diverted with the grimaces and contortions of his  victims; and at the same time you would fear to leave his arm  until his bottle was empty, knowing that, when once among the  crowd, you would run a good chance yourself of baptism with  his biting liquor.  Now my companion&#x27;s vitriol was  inexhaustible.</p>
<p>It was perhaps the consciousness of this, the knowledge that  I was being anointed already out of the vials of his wrath,  that made me fall to criticising the critic, whenever we had  parted.</p>
<p>After all, I thought, our satirist has just gone far enough  into his neighbours to find that the outside is false,  without caring to go farther and discover what is really  true.  He is content to find that things are not what they  seem, and broadly generalises from it that they do not exist  at all.  He sees our virtues are not what they pretend they  are; and, on the strength of that, he denies us the  possession of virtue altogether.  He has learnt the first  lesson, that no man is wholly good; but he has not even  suspected that there is another equally true, to wit, that no  man is wholly bad.  Like the inmate of a coloured star, he  has eyes for one colour alone.  He has a keen scent after  evil, but his nostrils are plugged against all good, as  people plugged their nostrils before going about the streets  of the plague-struck city.</p>
<p>Why does he do this?  It is most unreasonable to flee the  knowledge of good like the infection of a horrible disease,  and batten and grow fat in the real atmosphere of a lazar- house.  This was my first thought; but my second was not like  unto it, and I saw that our satirist was wise, wise in his  generation, like the unjust steward.  He does not want light,  because the darkness is more pleasant.  He does not wish to  see the good, because he is happier without it.  I recollect  that when I walked with him, I was in a state of divine  exaltation, such as Adam and Eve must have enjoyed when the  savour of the fruit was still unfaded between their lips; and  I recognise that this must be the man&#x27;s habitual state.  He  has the forbidden fruit in his waist-coat pocket, and can  make himself a god as often and as long as he likes.  He has  raised himself upon a glorious pedestal above his fellows; he  has touched the summit of ambition; and he envies neither  King nor Kaiser, Prophet nor Priest, content in an elevation  as high as theirs, and much more easily attained.  Yes,  certes, much more easily attained.  He has not risen by  climbing himself, but by pushing others down.  He has grown  great in his own estimation, not by blowing himself out, and  risking the fate of AEsop&#x27;s frog, but simply by the habitual  use of a diminishing glass on everybody else.  And I think  altogether that his is a better, a safer, and a surer recipe  than most others.</p>
<p>After all, however, looking back on what I have written, I  detect a spirit suspiciously like his own.  All through, I  have been comparing myself with our satirist, and all  through, I have had the best of the comparison.  Well, well,  contagion is as often mental as physical; and I do not think  my readers, who have all been under his lash, will blame me  very much for giving the headsman a mouthful of his own  sawdust.</p>
<p>SKETCHES CHAPTER II - NUITS BLANCHES</p>
<p>IF any one should know the pleasure and pain of a sleepless  night, it should be I.  I remember, so long ago, the sickly  child that woke from his few hours&#x27; slumber with the sweat of  a nightmare on his brow, to lie awake and listen and long for  the first signs of life among the silent streets.  These  nights of pain and weariness are graven on my mind; and so  when the same thing happened to me again, everything that I  heard or saw was rather a recollection than a discovery.</p>
<p>Weighed upon by the opaque and almost sensible darkness, I  listened eagerly for anything to break the sepulchral quiet.   But nothing came, save, perhaps, an emphatic crack from the  old cabinet that was made by Deacon Brodie, or the dry rustle  of the coals on the extinguished fire.  It was a calm; or I  know that I should have heard in the roar and clatter of the  storm, as I have not heard it for so many years, the wild  career of a horseman, always scouring up from the distance  and passing swiftly below the window; yet always returning  again from the place whence first he came, as though, baffled  by some higher power, he had retraced his steps to gain  impetus for another and another attempt.</p>
<p>As I lay there, there arose out of the utter stillness the  rumbling of a carriage a very great way off, that drew near,  and passed within a few streets of the house, and died away  as gradually as it had arisen.  This, too, was as a  reminiscence.</p>
<p>I rose and lifted a corner of the blind.  Over the black belt  of the garden I saw the long line of Queen Street, with here  and there a lighted window.  How often before had my nurse  lifted me out of bed and pointed them out to me, while we  wondered together if, there also, there were children that  could not sleep, and if these lighted oblongs were signs of  those that waited like us for the morning.</p>
<p>I went out into the lobby, and looked down into the great  deep well of the staircase.  For what cause I know not, just  as it used to be in the old days that the feverish child  might be the better served, a peep of gas illuminated a  narrow circle far below me.  But where I was, all was  darkness and silence, save the dry monotonous ticking of the  clock that came ceaselessly up to my ear.</p>
<p>The final crown of it all, however, the last touch of  reproduction on the pictures of my memory, was the arrival of  that time for which, all night through, I waited and longed  of old.  It was my custom, as the hours dragged on, to repeat  the question, &#x27;When will the carts come in?&#x27; and repeat it  again and again until at last those sounds arose in the  street that I have heard once more this morning.  The road  before our house is a great thoroughfare for early carts.  I  know not, and I never have known, what they carry, whence  they come, or whither they go.  But I know that, long ere  dawn, and for hours together, they stream continuously past,  with the same rolling and jerking of wheels and the same  clink of horses&#x27; feet.  It was not for nothing that they made  the burthen of my wishes all night through.  They are really  the first throbbings of life, the harbingers of day; and it  pleases you as much to hear them as it must please a  shipwrecked seaman once again to grasp a hand of flesh and  blood after years of miserable solitude.  They have the  freshness of the daylight life about them.  You can hear the  carters cracking their whips and crying hoarsely to their  horses or to one another; and sometimes even a peal of  healthy, harsh horse-laughter comes up to you through the  darkness.  There is now an end of mystery and fear.  Like the  knocking at the door in MACBETH, (1) or the cry of the  watchman in the TOUR DE NESLE, they show that the horrible  caesura is over and the nightmares have fled away, because  the day is breaking and the ordinary life of men is beginning  to bestir itself among the streets.</p>
<p>In the middle of it all I fell asleep, to be wakened by the  officious knocking at my door, and I find myself twelve years  older than I had dreamed myself all night.</p>

<p>SKETCHES CHAPTER III - THE WREATH OF IMMORTELLES</p>
<p>IT is all very well to talk of death as &#x27;a pleasant potion of  immortality&#x27;, but the most of us, I suspect, are of &#x27;queasy  stomachs,&#x27; and find it none of the sweetest. (1)  The  graveyard may be cloak-room to Heaven; but we must admit that  it is a very ugly and offensive vestibule in itself, however  fair may be the life to which it leads.  And though Enoch and  Elias went into the temple through a gate which certainly may  be called Beautiful, the rest of us have to find our way to  it through Ezekiel&#x27;s low-bowed door and the vault full of  creeping things and all manner of abominable beasts.   Nevertheless, there is a certain frame of mind to which a  cemetery is, if not an antidote, at least an alleviation.  If  you are in a fit of the blues, go nowhere else.  It was in  obedience to this wise regulation that the other morning  found me lighting my pipe at the entrance to Old Greyfriars&#x27;,  thoroughly sick of the town, the country, and myself.</p>
<p>Two of the men were talking at the gate, one of them carrying  a spade in hands still crusted with the soil of graves.   Their very aspect was delightful to me; and I crept nearer to  them, thinking to pick up some snatch of sexton gossip, some  &#x27;talk fit for a charnel,&#x27; (2) something, in fine, worthy of  that fastidious logician, that adept in coroner&#x27;s law, who  has come down to us as the patron of Yaughan&#x27;s liquor, and  the very prince of gravediggers.  Scots people in general are  so much wrapped up in their profession that I had a good  chance of overhearing such conversation: the talk of fish- mongers running usually on stockfish and haddocks; while of  the Scots sexton I could repeat stories and speeches that  positively smell of the graveyard.  But on this occasion I  was doomed to disappointment.  My two friends were far into  the region of generalities.  Their profession was forgotten  in their electorship.  Politics had engulfed the narrower  economy of grave-digging.  &#x27;Na, na,&#x27; said the one, &#x27;ye&#x27;re a&#x27;  wrang.&#x27;  &#x27;The English and Irish Churches,&#x27; answered the  other, in a tone as if he had made the remark before, and it  had been called in question - &#x27;The English and Irish Churches  have IMPOVERISHED the country.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Such are the results of education,&#x27; thought I as I passed  beside them and came fairly among the tombs.  Here, at least,  there were no commonplace politics, no diluted this-morning&#x27;s  leader, to distract or offend me.  The old shabby church  showed, as usual, its quaint extent of roofage and the  relievo skeleton on one gable, still blackened with the fire  of thirty years ago.  A chill dank mist lay over all.  The  Old Greyfriars&#x27; churchyard was in perfection that morning,  and one could go round and reckon up the associations with no  fear of vulgar interruption.  On this stone the Covenant was  signed.  In that vault, as the story goes, John Knox took  hiding in some Reformation broil.  From that window Burke the  murderer looked out many a time across the tombs, and perhaps  o&#x27; nights let himself down over the sill to rob some new-made  grave.  Certainly he would have a selection here.  The very  walks have been carried over forgotten resting-places; and  the whole ground is uneven, because (as I was once quaintly  told) &#x27;when the wood rots it stands to reason the soil should  fall in,&#x27; which, from the law of gravitation, is certainly  beyond denial.  But it is round the boundary that there are  the finest tombs.  The whole irregular space is, as it were,  fringed with quaint old monuments, rich in death&#x27;s-heads and  scythes and hour-glasses, and doubly rich in pious epitaphs  and Latin mottoes - rich in them to such an extent that their  proper space has run over, and they have crawled end-long up  the shafts of columns and ensconced themselves in all sorts  of odd corners among the sculpture.  These tombs raise their  backs against the rabble of squalid dwelling-houses, and  every here and there a clothes-pole projects between two  monuments its fluttering trophy of white and yellow and red.   With a grim irony they recall the banners in the Invalides,  banners as appropriate perhaps over the sepulchres of tailors  and weavers as these others above the dust of armies.  Why  they put things out to dry on that particular morning it was  hard to imagine.  The grass was grey with drops of rain, the  headstones black with moisture.  Yet, in despite of weather  and common sense, there they hung between the tombs; and  beyond them I could see through open windows into miserable  rooms where whole families were born and fed, and slept and  died.  At one a girl sat singing merrily with her back to the  graveyard; and from another came the shrill tones of a  scolding woman.  Every here and there was a town garden full  of sickly flowers, or a pile of crockery inside upon the  window-seat.  But you do not grasp the full connection  between these houses of the dead and the living, the  unnatural marriage of stately sepulchres and squalid houses,  till, lower down, where the road has sunk far below the  surface of the cemetery, and the very roofs are scarcely on a  level with its wall, you observe that a proprietor has taken  advantage of a tall monument and trained a chimney-stack  against its back.  It startles you to see the red, modern  pots peering over the shoulder of the tomb.</p>
<p>A man was at work on a grave, his spade clinking away the  drift of bones that permeates the thin brown soil; but my  first disappointment had taught me to expect little from  Greyfriars&#x27; sextons, and I passed him by in silence.  A  slater on the slope of a neighbouring roof eyed me curiously.   A lean black cat, looking as if it had battened on strange  meats, slipped past me.  A little boy at a window put his  finger to his nose in so offensive a manner that I was put  upon my dignity, and turned grandly off to read old epitaphs  and peer through the gratings into the shadow of vaults.</p>
<p>Just then I saw two women coming down a path, one of them  old, and the other younger, with a child in her arms.  Both  had faces eaten with famine and hardened with sin, and both  had reached that stage of degradation, much lower in a woman  than a man, when all care for dress is lost.  As they came  down they neared a grave, where some pious friend or relative  had laid a wreath of immortelles, and put a bell glass over  it, as is the custom.  The effect of that ring of dull yellow  among so many blackened and dusty sculptures was more  pleasant than it is in modern cemeteries, where every second  mound can boast a similar coronal; and here, where it was the  exception and not the rule, I could even fancy the drops of  moisture that dimmed the covering were the tears of those who  laid it where it was.  As the two women came up to it, one of  them kneeled down on the wet grass and looked long and  silently through the clouded shade, while the second stood  above her, gently oscillating to and fro to lull the muling  baby.  I was struck a great way off with something religious  in the attitude of these two unkempt and haggard women; and I  drew near faster, but still cautiously, to hear what they  were saying.  Surely on them the spirit of death and decay  had descended; I had no education to dread here: should I not  have a chance of seeing nature?  Alas! a pawnbroker could not  have been more practical and commonplace, for this was what  the kneeling woman said to the woman upright - this and  nothing more: &#x27;Eh, what extravagance!&#x27;</p>
<p>O nineteenth century, wonderful art thou indeed - wonderful,  but wearisome in thy stale and deadly uniformity.  Thy men  are more like numerals than men.  They must bear their  idiosyncrasies or their professions written on a placard  about their neck, like the scenery in Shakespeare&#x27;s theatre.   Thy precepts of economy have pierced into the lowest ranks of  life; and there is now a decorum in vice, a respectability  among the disreputable, a pure spirit of Philistinism among  the waifs and strays of thy Bohemia.  For lo! thy very  gravediggers talk politics; and thy castaways kneel upon new  graves, to discuss the cost of the monument and grumble at  the improvidence of love.</p>
<p>Such was the elegant apostrophe that I made as I went out of  the gates again, happily satisfied in myself, and feeling  that I alone of all whom I had seen was able to profit by the  silent poem of these green mounds and blackened headstones.</p>

<p>SKETCHES CHAPTER IV - NURSES</p>
<p>I KNEW one once, and the room where, lonely and old, she  waited for death.  It was pleasant enough, high up above the  lane, and looking forth upon a hill-side, covered all day  with sheets and yellow blankets, and with long lines of  underclothing fluttering between the battered posts.  There  were any number of cheap prints, and a drawing by one of &#x27;her  children,&#x27; and there were flowers in the window, and a sickly  canary withered into consumption in an ornamental cage.  The  bed, with its checked coverlid, was in a closet.  A great  Bible lay on the table; and her drawers were full of  &#x27;scones,&#x27; which it was her pleasure to give to young visitors  such as I was then.</p>
<p>You may not think this a melancholy picture; but the canary,  and the cat, and the white mouse that she had for a while,  and that died, were all indications of the want that ate into  her heart.  I think I know a little of what that old woman  felt; and I am as sure as if I had seen her, that she sat  many an hour in silent tears, with the big Bible open before  her clouded eyes.</p>
<p>If you could look back upon her life, and feel the great  chain that had linked her to one child after another,  sometimes to be wrenched suddenly through, and sometimes,  which is infinitely worse, to be torn gradually off through  years of growing neglect, or perhaps growing dislike!  She  had, like the mother, overcome that natural repugnance -  repugnance which no man can conquer - towards the infirm and  helpless mass of putty of the earlier stage.  She had spent  her best and happiest years in tending, watching, and  learning to love like a mother this child, with which she has  no connection and to which she has no tie.  Perhaps she  refused some sweetheart (such things have been), or put him  off and off, until he lost heart and turned to some one else,  all for fear of leaving this creature that had wound itself  about her heart.  And the end of it all - her month&#x27;s  warning, and a present perhaps, and the rest of the life to  vain regret.  Or, worse still, to see the child gradually  forgetting and forsaking her, fostered in disrespect and  neglect on the plea of growing manliness, and at last  beginning to treat her as a servant whom he had treated a few  years before as a mother.  She sees the Bible or the Psalm- book, which with gladness and love unutterable in her heart  she had bought for him years ago out of her slender savings,  neglected for some newer gift of his father, lying in dust in  the lumber-room or given away to a poor child, and the act  applauded for its unfeeling charity.  Little wonder if she  becomes hurt and angry, and attempts to tyrannise and to  grasp her old power back again.  We are not all patient  Grizzels, by good fortune, but the most of us human beings  with feelings and tempers of our own.</p>
<p>And so, in the end, behold her in the room that I described.   Very likely and very naturally, in some fling of feverish  misery or recoil of thwarted love, she has quarrelled with  her old employers and the children are forbidden to see her  or to speak to her; or at best she gets her rent paid and a  little to herself, and now and then her late charges are sent  up (with another nurse, perhaps) to pay her a short visit.   How bright these visits seem as she looks forward to them on  her lonely bed!  How unsatisfactory their realisation, when  the forgetful child, half wondering, checks with every word  and action the outpouring of her maternal love!  How bitter  and restless the memories that they leave behind!  And for  the rest, what else has she? - to watch them with eager eyes  as they go to school, to sit in church where she can see them  every Sunday, to be passed some day unnoticed in the street,  or deliberately cut because the great man or the great woman  are with friends before whom they are ashamed to recognise  the old woman that loved them.</p>
<p>When she goes home that night, how lonely will the room  appear to her!  Perhaps the neighbours may hear her sobbing  to herself in the dark, with the fire burnt out for want of  fuel, and the candle still unlit upon the table.</p>
<p>And it is for this that they live, these quasi-mothers -  mothers in everything but the travail and the thanks.  It is  for this that they have remained virtuous in youth, living  the dull life of a household servant.  It is for this that  they refused the old sweetheart, and have no fireside or  offspring of their own.</p>
<p>I believe in a better state of things, that there will be no  more nurses, and that every mother will nurse her own  offspring; for what can be more hardening and demoralising  than to call forth the tenderest feelings of a woman&#x27;s heart  and cherish them yourself as long as you need them, as long  as your children require a nurse to love them, and then to  blight and thwart and destroy them, whenever your own use for  them is at an end.  This may be Utopian; but it is always a  little thing if one mother or two mothers can be brought to  feel more tenderly to those who share their toil and have no  part in their reward.</p>
<p>SKETCHES CHAPTER V - A CHARACTER</p>
<p>THE man has a red, bloated face, and his figure is short and  squat.  So far there is nothing in him to notice, but when  you see his eyes, you can read in these hard and shallow orbs  a depravity beyond measure depraved, a thirst after  wickedness, the pure, disinterested love of Hell for its own  sake.  The other night, in the street, I was watching an  omnibus passing with lit-up windows, when I heard some one  coughing at my side as though he would cough his soul out;  and turning round, I saw him stopping under a lamp, with a  brown greatcoat buttoned round him and his whole face  convulsed.  It seemed as if he could not live long; and so  the sight set my mind upon a train of thought, as I finished  my cigar up and down the lighted streets.</p>
<p>He is old, but all these years have not yet quenched his  thirst for evil, and his eyes still delight themselves in  wickedness.  He is dumb; but he will not let that hinder his  foul trade, or perhaps I should say, his yet fouler  amusement, and he has pressed a slate into the service of  corruption.  Look at him, and he will sign to you with his  bloated head, and when you go to him in answer to the sign,  thinking perhaps that the poor dumb man has lost his way, you  will see what he writes upon his slate.  He haunts the doors  of schools, and shows such inscriptions as these to the  innocent children that come out.  He hangs about picture- galleries, and makes the noblest pictures the text for some  silent homily of vice.  His industry is a lesson to  ourselves.  Is it not wonderful how he can triumph over his  infirmities and do such an amount of harm without a tongue?   Wonderful industry - strange, fruitless, pleasureless toil?   Must not the very devil feel a soft emotion to see his  disinterested and laborious service?  Ah, but the devil knows  better than this: he knows that this man is penetrated with  the love of evil and that all his pleasure is shut up in  wickedness: he recognises him, perhaps, as a fit type for  mankind of his satanic self, and watches over his effigy as  we might watch over a favourite likeness.  As the business  man comes to love the toil, which he only looked upon at  first as a ladder towards other desires and less unnatural  gratifications, so the dumb man has felt the charm of his  trade and fallen captivated before the eyes of sin.  It is a  mistake when preachers tell us that vice is hideous and  loathsome; for even vice has her Horsel and her devotees, who  love her for her own sake.</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD CHAPTER I - NANCE AT THE &#x27;GREEN DRAGON&#x27;</p>
<p>NANCE HOLDAWAY was on her knees before the fire blowing the  green wood that voluminously smoked upon the dogs, and only  now and then shot forth a smothered flame; her knees already  ached and her eyes smarted, for she had been some while at  this ungrateful task, but her mind was gone far away to meet  the coming stranger.  Now she met him in the wood, now at the  castle gate, now in the kitchen by candle-light; each fresh  presentment eclipsed the one before; a form so elegant,  manners so sedate, a countenance so brave and comely, a voice  so winning and resolute - sure such a man was never seen!   The thick-coming fancies poured and brightened in her head  like the smoke and flames upon the hearth.</p>
<p>Presently the heavy foot of her uncle Jonathan was heard upon  the stair, and as he entered the room she bent the closer to  her work.  He glanced at the green fagots with a sneer, and  looked askance at the bed and the white sheets, at the strip  of carpet laid, like an island, on the great expanse of the  stone floor, and at the broken glazing of the casement  clumsily repaired with paper.</p>
<p>&#x27;Leave that fire a-be,&#x27; he cried.  &#x27;What, have I toiled all  my life to turn innkeeper at the hind end?  Leave it a-be, I  say.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;La, uncle, it doesn&#x27;t burn a bit; it only smokes,&#x27; said  Nance, looking up from her position.</p>
<p>&#x27;You are come of decent people on both sides,&#x27; returned the  old man.  &#x27;Who are you to blow the coals for any Robin-run- agate?  Get up, get on your hood, make yourself useful, and  be off to the &quot;Green Dragon.&quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I thought you was to go yourself,&#x27; Nance faltered.</p>
<p>&#x27;So did I,&#x27; quoth Jonathan; &#x27;but it appears I was mistook.&#x27;</p>
<p>The very excess of her eagerness alarmed her, and she began  to hang back.  &#x27;I think I would rather not, dear uncle,&#x27; she  said.  &#x27;Night is at hand, and I think, dear, I would rather  not.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Now you look here,&#x27; replied Jonathan, &#x27;I have my lord&#x27;s  orders, have I not?  Little he gives me, but it&#x27;s all my  livelihood.  And do you fancy, if I disobey my lord, I&#x27;m  likely to turn round for a lass like you?  No, I&#x27;ve that  hell-fire of pain in my old knee, I wouldn&#x27;t walk a mile, not  for King George upon his bended knees.&#x27;  And he walked to the  window and looked down the steep scarp to where the river  foamed in the bottom of the dell.</p>
<p>Nance stayed for no more bidding.  In her own room, by the  glimmer of the twilight, she washed her hands and pulled on  her Sunday mittens; adjusted her black hood, and tied a dozen  times its cherry ribbons; and in less than ten minutes, with  a fluttering heart and excellently bright eyes, she passed  forth under the arch and over the bridge, into the thickening  shadows of the groves.  A well-marked wheel-track conducted  her.  The wood, which upon both sides of the river dell was a  mere scrambling thicket of hazel, hawthorn, and holly,  boasted on the level of more considerable timber.  Beeches  came to a good growth, with here and there an oak; and the  track now passed under a high arcade of branches, and now ran  under the open sky in glades.  As the girl proceeded these  glades became more frequent, the trees began again to decline  in size, and the wood to degenerate into furzy coverts.  Last  of all there was a fringe of elders; and beyond that the  track came forth upon an open, rolling moorland, dotted with  wind-bowed and scanty bushes, and all golden brown with the  winter, like a grouse.  Right over against the girl the last  red embers of the sunset burned under horizontal clouds; the  night fell clear and still and frosty, and the track in low  and marshy passages began to crackle under foot with ice.</p>
<p>Some half a mile beyond the borders of the wood the lights of  the &#x27;Green Dragon&#x27; hove in sight, and running close beside  them, very faint in the dying dusk, the pale ribbon of the  Great North Road.  It was the back of the post-house that was  presented to Nance Holdaway; and as she continued to draw  near and the night to fall more completely, she became aware  of an unusual brightness and bustle.  A post-chaise stood in  the yard, its lamps already lighted: light shone hospitably  in the windows and from the open door; moving lights and  shadows testified to the activity of servants bearing  lanterns.  The clank of pails, the stamping of hoofs on the  firm causeway, the jingle of harness, and, last of all, the  energetic hissing of a groom, began to fall upon her ear.  By  the stir you would have thought the mail was at the door, but  it was still too early in the night.  The down mail was not  due at the &#x27;Green Dragon&#x27; for hard upon an hour; the up mail  from Scotland not before two in the black morning.</p>
<p>Nance entered the yard somewhat dazzled.  Sam, the tall  ostler, was polishing a curb-chain wit sand; the lantern at  his feet letting up spouts of candle-light through the holes  with which its conical roof was peppered.</p>
<p>&#x27;Hey, miss,&#x27; said he jocularly, &#x27;you won&#x27;t look at me any  more, now you have gentry at the castle.&#x27;</p>
<p>Her cheeks burned with anger.</p>
<p>&#x27;That&#x27;s my lord&#x27;s chay,&#x27; the man continued, nodding at the  chaise, &#x27;Lord Windermoor&#x27;s.  Came all in a fluster - dinner,  bowl of punch, and put the horses to. For all the world like  a runaway match, my dear - bar the bride.  He brought Mr.  Archer in the chay with him.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Is that Holdaway?&#x27; cried the landlord from the lighted  entry, where he stood shading his eyes.</p>
<p>&#x27;Only me, sir,&#x27; answered Nance.</p>
<p>&#x27;O, you, Miss Nance,&#x27; he said.  &#x27;Well, come in quick, my  pretty.  My lord is waiting for your uncle.&#x27;</p>
<p>And he ushered Nance into a room cased with yellow wainscot  and lighted by tall candles, where two gentlemen sat at a  table finishing a bowl of punch.  One of these was stout,  elderly, and irascible, with a face like a full moon, well  dyed with liquor, thick tremulous lips, a short, purple hand,  in which he brandished a long pipe, and an abrupt and  gobbling utterance.  This was my Lord Windermoor.  In his  companion Nance beheld a younger man, tall, quiet, grave,  demurely dressed, and wearing his own hair.  Her glance but  lighted on him, and she flushed, for in that second she made  sure that she had twice betrayed herself - betrayed by the  involuntary flash of her black eyes her secret impatience to  behold this new companion, and, what was far worse, betrayed  her disappointment in the realisation of her dreams.  He,  meanwhile, as if unconscious, continued to regard her with  unmoved decorum.</p>
<p>&#x27;O, a man of wood,&#x27; thought Nance.</p>
<p>&#x27;What - what?&#x27; said his lordship.  &#x27;Who is this?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;If you please, my lord, I am Holdaway&#x27;s niece,&#x27; replied  Nance, with a curtsey.</p>
<p>&#x27;Should have been here himself,&#x27; observed his lordship.   &#x27;Well, you tell Holdaway that I&#x27;m aground, not a stiver - not  a stiver.  I&#x27;m running from the beagles - going abroad, tell  Holdaway.  And he need look for no more wages: glad of &#x27;em  myself, if I could get &#x27;em.  He can live in the castle if he  likes, or go to the devil.  O, and here is Mr. Archer; and I  recommend him to take him in - a friend of mine - and Mr.  Archer will pay, as I wrote.  And I regard that in the light  of a precious good thing for Holdaway, let me tell you, and a  set-off against the wages.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;But O, my lord!&#x27; cried Nance, &#x27;we live upon the wages, and  what are we to do without?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;What am I to do? - what am I to do?&#x27; replied Lord Windermoor  with some exasperation.  &#x27;I have no wages.  And there is Mr.  Archer.  And if Holdaway doesn&#x27;t like it, he can go to the  devil, and you with him! - and you with him!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And yet, my lord,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, &#x27;these good people will  have as keen a sense of loss as you or I; keener, perhaps,  since they have done nothing to deserve it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Deserve it?&#x27; cried the peer.  &#x27;What?  What?  If a rascally  highwayman comes up to me with a confounded pistol, do you  say that I&#x27;ve deserved it?  How often am I to tell you, sir,  that I was cheated - that I was cheated?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;You are happy in the belief,&#x27; returned Mr. Archer gravely.</p>
<p>&#x27;Archer, you would be the death of me!&#x27; exclaimed his  lordship.  &#x27;You know you&#x27;re drunk; you know it, sir; and yet  you can&#x27;t get up a spark of animation.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I have drunk fair, my lord,&#x27; replied the younger man; &#x27;but I  own I am conscious of no exhilaration.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;If you had as black a look-out as me, sir,&#x27; cried the peer,  &#x27;you would be very glad of a little innocent exhilaration,  let me tell you.  I am glad of it - glad of it, and I only  wish I was drunker.  For let me tell you it&#x27;s a cruel hard  thing upon a man of my time of life and my position, to be  brought down to beggary because the world is full of thieves  and rascals - thieves and rascals.  What?  For all I know,  you may be a thief and a rascal yourself; and I would fight  you for a pinch of snuff - a pinch of snuff,&#x27; exclaimed his  lordship.</p>
<p>Here Mr. Archer turned to Nance Holdaway with a pleasant  smile, so full of sweetness, kindness, and composure that, at  one bound, her dreams returned to her.  &#x27;My good Miss  Holdaway,&#x27; said he, &#x27;if you are willing to show me the road,  I am even eager to be gone.  As for his lordship and myself,  compose yourself; there is no fear; this is his lordship&#x27;s  way.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;What? what?&#x27; cried his lordship.  &#x27;My way?  Ish no such a  thing, my way.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Come, my lord,&#x27; cried Archer; &#x27;you and I very thoroughly  understand each other; and let me suggest, it is time that  both of us were gone.  The mail will soon be due.  Here,  then, my lord, I take my leave of you, with the most earnest  assurance of my gratitude for the past, and a sincere offer  of any services I may be able to render in the future.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Archer,&#x27; exclaimed Lord Windermoor, &#x27;I love you like a son.   Le&#x27; &#x27;s have another bowl.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;My lord, for both our sakes, you will excuse me,&#x27; replied  Mr. Archer.  &#x27;We both require caution; we must both, for some  while at least, avoid the chance of a pursuit.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Archer,&#x27; quoth his lordship, &#x27;this is a rank ingratishood.   What?  I&#x27;m to go firing away in the dark in the cold  po&#x27;chaise, and not so much as a game of ecarte possible,  unless I stop and play with the postillion, the postillion;  and the whole country swarming with thieves and rascals and  highwaymen.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I beg your lordship&#x27;s pardon,&#x27; put in the landlord, who now  appeared in the doorway to announce the chaise, &#x27;but this  part of the North Road is known for safety.  There has not  been a robbery, to call a robbery, this five years&#x27; time.   Further south, of course, it&#x27;s nearer London, and another  story,&#x27; he added.</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, then, if that&#x27;s so,&#x27; concluded my lord, &#x27;le&#x27; &#x27;s have  t&#x27;other bowl and a pack of cards.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;My lord, you forget,&#x27; said Archer, &#x27;I might still gain; but  it is hardly possible for me to lose.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Think I&#x27;m a sharper?&#x27; inquired the peer.  &#x27;Gen&#x27;leman&#x27;s  parole&#x27;s all I ask.&#x27;</p>
<p>But Mr. Archer was proof against these blandishments, and  said farewell gravely enough to Lord Windermoor, shaking his  hand and at the same time bowing very low.  &#x27;You will never  know,&#x27; says he, &#x27;the service you have done me.&#x27;  And with  that, and before my lord had finally taken up his meaning, he  had slipped about the table, touched Nance lightly but  imperiously on the arm, and left the room.  In face of the  outbreak of his lordship&#x27;s lamentations she made haste to  follow the truant.</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD CHAPTER II - IN WHICH MR. ARCHER IS INSTALLED</p>
<p>THE chaise had been driven round to the front door; the  courtyard lay all deserted, and only lit by a lantern set  upon a window-sill.  Through this Nance rapidly led the way,  and began to ascend the swellings of the moor with a heart  that somewhat fluttered in her bosom.  She was not afraid,  but in the course of these last passages with Lord Windermoor  Mr. Archer had ascended to that pedestal on which her fancy  waited to instal him.  The reality, she felt, excelled her  dreams, and this cold night walk was the first romantic  incident in her experience.</p>
<p>It was the rule in these days to see gentlemen unsteady after  dinner, yet Nance was both surprised and amused when her  companion, who had spoken so soberly, began to stumble and  waver by her side with the most airy divagations.  Sometimes  he would get so close to her that she must edge away; and at  others lurch clear out of the track and plough among deep  heather.  His courtesy and gravity meanwhile remained  unaltered.  He asked her how far they had to go; whether the  way lay all upon the moorland, and when he learned they had  to pass a wood expressed his pleasure.  &#x27;For,&#x27; said he, &#x27;I am  passionately fond of trees.  Trees and fair lawns, if you  consider of it rightly, are the ornaments of nature, as  palaces and fine approaches - &#x27;  And here he stumbled into a  patch of slough and nearly fell.  The girl had hard work not  to laugh, but at heart she was lost in admiration for one who  talked so elegantly.</p>
<p>They had got to about a quarter of a mile from the &#x27;Green  Dragon,&#x27; and were near the summit of the rise, when a sudden  rush of wheels arrested them.  Turning and looking back, they  saw the post-house, now much declined in brightness; and  speeding away northward the two tremulous bright dots of my  Lord Windermoor&#x27;s chaise-lamps.  Mr. Archer followed these  yellow and unsteady stars until they dwindled into points and  disappeared.</p>
<p>&#x27;There goes my only friend,&#x27; he said.  &#x27;Death has cut off  those that loved me, and change of fortune estranged my  flatterers; and but for you, poor bankrupt, my life is as  lonely as this moor.&#x27;</p>
<p>The tone of his voice affected both of them.  They stood  there on the side of the moor, and became thrillingly  conscious of the void waste of the night, without a feature  for the eye, and except for the fainting whisper of the  carriage-wheels without a murmur for the ear.  And instantly,  like a mockery, there broke out, very far away, but clear and  jolly, the note of the mail-guard&#x27;s horn.  &#x27;Over the hills&#x27;  was his air.  It rose to the two watchers on the moor with  the most cheerful sentiment of human company and travel, and  at the same time in and around the &#x27;Green Dragon&#x27; it woke up  a great bustle of lights running to and fro and clattering  hoofs.  Presently after, out of the darkness to southward,  the mail grew near with a growing rumble.  Its lamps were  very large and bright, and threw their radiance forward in  overlapping cones; the four cantering horses swarmed and  steamed; the body of the coach followed like a great shadow;  and this lit picture slid with a sort of ineffectual  swiftness over the black field of night, and was eclipsed by  the buildings of the &#x27;Green Dragon.&#x27;</p>
<p>Mr. Archer turned abruptly and resumed his former walk; only  that he was now more steady, kept better alongside his young  conductor, and had fallen into a silence broken by sighs.   Nance waxed very pitiful over his fate, contrasting an  imaginary past of courts and great society, and perhaps the  King himself, with the tumbledown ruin in a wood to which she  was now conducting him.</p>
<p>&#x27;You must try, sir, to keep your spirits up,&#x27; said she.  &#x27;To  be sure this is a great change for one like you; but who  knows the future?&#x27;</p>
<p>Mr. Archer turned towards her in the darkness, and she could  clearly perceive that he smiled upon her very kindly.  &#x27;There  spoke a sweet nature,&#x27; said he, &#x27;and I must thank you for  these words.  But I would not have you fancy that I regret  the past for any happiness found in it, or that I fear the  simplicity and hardship of the country.  I am a man that has  been much tossed about in life; now up, now down; and do you  think that I shall not be able to support what you support -  you who are kind, and therefore know how to feel pain; who  are beautiful, and therefore hope; who are young, and  therefore (or am I the more mistaken?) discontented?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Nay, sir, not that, at least,&#x27; said Nance; &#x27;not  discontented.  If I were to be discontented, how should I  look those that have real sorrows in the face?  I have faults  enough, but not that fault; and I have my merits too, for I  have a good opinion of myself.  But for beauty, I am not so  simple but that I can tell a banter from a compliment.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Nay, nay,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, &#x27;I had half forgotten; grief is  selfish, and I was thinking of myself and not of you, or I  had never blurted out so bold a piece of praise.  &#x27;Tis the  best proof of my sincerity.  But come, now, I would lay a  wager you are no coward?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Indeed, sir, I am not more afraid than another,&#x27; said Nance.   &#x27;None of my blood are given to fear.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And you are honest?&#x27; he returned.</p>
<p>&#x27;I will answer for that,&#x27; said she.</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, then, to be brave, to be honest, to be kind, and to be  contented, since you say you are so - is not that to fill up  a great part of virtue?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I fear you are but a flatterer,&#x27; said Nance, but she did not  say it clearly, for what with bewilderment and satisfaction,  her heart was quite oppressed.</p>
<p>There could be no harm, certainly, in these grave  compliments; but yet they charmed and frightened her, and to  find favour, for reasons however obscure, in the eyes of this  elegant, serious, and most unfortunate young gentleman, was a  giddy elevation, was almost an apotheosis, for a country  maid.</p>
<p>But she was to be no more exercised; for Mr. Archer,  disclaiming any thought of flattery, turned off to other  subjects, and held her all through the wood in conversation,  addressing her with an air of perfect sincerity, and  listening to her answers with every mark of interest.  Had  open flattery continued, Nance would have soon found refuge  in good sense; but the more subtle lure she could not  suspect, much less avoid.  It was the first time she had ever  taken part in a conversation illuminated by any ideas.  All  was then true that she had heard and dreamed of gentlemen;  they were a race apart, like deities knowing good and evil.   And then there burst upon her soul a divine thought, hope&#x27;s  glorious sunrise: since she could understand, since it seemed  that she too, even she, could interest this sorrowful Apollo,  might she not learn? or was she not learning?  Would not her  soul awake and put forth wings?  Was she not, in fact, an  enchanted princess, waiting but a touch to become royal?  She  saw herself transformed, radiantly attired, but in the most  exquisite taste: her face grown longer and more refined; her  tint etherealised; and she heard herself with delighted  wonder talking like a book.</p>
<p>Meanwhile they had arrived at where the track comes out above  the river dell, and saw in front of them the castle, faintly  shadowed on the night, covering with its broken battlements a  bold projection of the bank, and showing at the extreme end,  where were the habitable tower and wing, some crevices of  candle-light.  Hence she called loudly upon her uncle, and he  was seen to issue, lantern in hand, from the tower door, and,  where the ruins did not intervene, to pick his way over the  swarded courtyard, avoiding treacherous cellars and winding  among blocks of fallen masonry.  The arch of the great gate  was still entire, flanked by two tottering bastions, and it  was here that Jonathan met them, standing at the edge of the  bridge, bent somewhat forward, and blinking at them through  the glow of his own lantern.  Mr. Archer greeted him with  civility; but the old man was in no humour of compliance.  He  guided the new-comer across the court-yard, looking sharply  and quickly in his face, and grumbling all the time about the  cold, and the discomfort and dilapidation of the castle.  He  was sure he hoped that Mr. Archer would like it; but in truth  he could not think what brought him there.  Doubtless he had  a good reason - this with a look of cunning scrutiny - but,  indeed, the place was quite unfit for any person of repute;  he himself was eaten up with the rheumatics.  It was the most  rheumaticky place in England, and some fine day the whole  habitable part (to call it habitable) would fetch away bodily  and go down the slope into the river.  He had seen the cracks  widening; there was a plaguy issue in the bank below; he  thought a spring was mining it; it might be tomorrow, it  might be next day; but they were all sure of a come-down  sooner or later.  &#x27;And that is a poor death,&#x27; said he, &#x27;for  any one, let alone a gentleman, to have a whole old ruin  dumped upon his belly.  Have a care to your left there; these  cellar vaults have all broke down, and the grass and hemlock  hide &#x27;em.  Well, sir, here is welcome to you, such as it is,  and wishing you well away.&#x27;</p>
<p>And with that Jonathan ushered his guest through the tower  door, and down three steps on the left hand into the kitchen  or common room of the castle.  It was a huge, low room, as  large as a meadow, occupying the whole width of the habitable  wing, with six barred windows looking on the court, and two  into the river valley.  A dresser, a table, and a few chairs  stood dotted here and there upon the uneven flags.  Under the  great chimney a good fire burned in an iron fire-basket; a  high old settee, rudely carved with figures and Gothic  lettering, flanked it on either side; there was a hinge table  and a stone bench in the chimney corner, and above the arch  hung guns, axes, lanterns, and great sheaves of rusty keys.</p>
<p>Jonathan looked about him, holding up the lantern, and  shrugged his shoulders, with a pitying grimace.  &#x27;Here it  is,&#x27; he said.  &#x27;See the damp on the floor, look at the moss;  where there&#x27;s moss you may be sure that it&#x27;s rheumaticky.   Try and get near that fire for to warm yourself; it&#x27;ll blow  the coat off your back.  And with a young gentleman with a  face like yours, as pale as a tallow-candle, I&#x27;d be afeard of  a churchyard cough and a galloping decline,&#x27; says Jonathan,  naming the maladies with gloomy gusto, &#x27;or the cold might  strike and turn your blood,&#x27; he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Archer fairly laughed.  &#x27;My good Mr. Holdaway,&#x27; said he,  &#x27;I was born with that same tallow-candle face, and the only  fear that you inspire me with is the fear that I intrude  unwelcomely upon your private hours.  But I think I can  promise you that I am very little troublesome, and I am  inclined to hope that the terms which I can offer may still  pay you the derangement.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Yes, the terms,&#x27; said Jonathan, &#x27;I was thinking of that.  As  you say, they are very small,&#x27; and he shook his head.</p>
<p>&#x27;Unhappily, I can afford no more,&#x27; said Mr. Archer.  &#x27;But  this we have arranged already,&#x27; he added with a certain  stiffness; &#x27;and as I am aware that Miss Holdaway has matter  to communicate, I will, if you permit, retire at once.  To- night I must bivouac; to-morrow my trunk is to follow from  the &quot;Dragon.&quot;  So if you will show me to my room I shall wish  you a good slumber and a better awakening.&#x27;</p>
<p>Jonathan silently gave the lantern to Nance, and she, turning  and curtseying in the doorway, proceeded to conduct their  guest up the broad winding staircase of the tower.  He  followed with a very brooding face.</p>
<p>&#x27;Alas!&#x27; cried Nance, as she entered the room, &#x27;your fire  black out,&#x27; and, setting down the lantern, she clapped upon  her knees before the chimney and began to rearrange the  charred and still smouldering remains.  Mr. Archer looked  about the gaunt apartment with a sort of shudder.  The great  height, the bare stone, the shattered windows, the aspect of  the uncurtained bed, with one of its four fluted columns  broken short, all struck a chill upon his fancy.  From this  dismal survey his eyes returned to Nance crouching before the  fire, the candle in one hand and artfully puffing at the  embers; the flames as they broke forth played upon the soft  outline of her cheek - she was alive and young, coloured with  the bright hues of life, and a woman.  He looked upon her,  softening; and then sat down and continued to admire the  picture.</p>
<p>&#x27;There, sir,&#x27; said she, getting upon her feet, &#x27;your fire is  doing bravely now.  Good-night.&#x27;</p>
<p>He rose and held out his hand.  &#x27;Come,&#x27; said he, &#x27;you are my  only friend in these parts, and you must shake hands.&#x27;</p>
<p>She brushed her hand upon her skirt and offered it, blushing.</p>
<p>&#x27;God bless you, my dear,&#x27; said he.</p>
<p>And then, when he was alone, he opened one of the windows,  and stared down into the dark valley.  A gentle wimpling of  the river among stones ascended to his ear; the trees upon  the other bank stood very black against the sky; farther away  an owl was hooting.  It was dreary and cold, and as he turned  back to the hearth and the fine glow of fire, &#x27;Heavens!&#x27; said  he to himself, &#x27;what an unfortunate destiny is mine!&#x27;</p>
<p>He went to bed, but sleep only visited his pillow in uneasy  snatches.  Outbreaks of loud speech came up the staircase; he  heard the old stones of the castle crack in the frosty night  with sharp reverberations, and the bed complained under his  tossings.  Lastly, far on into the morning, he awakened from  a doze to hear, very far off, in the extreme and breathless  quiet, a wailing flourish on the horn.  The down mail was  drawing near to the &#x27;Green Dragon.&#x27;  He sat up in bed; the  sound was tragical by distance, and the modulation appealed  to his ear like human speech.  It seemed to call upon him  with a dreary insistence - to call him far away, to address  him personally, and to have a meaning that he failed to  seize.  It was thus, at least, in this nodding castle, in a  cold, miry woodland, and so far from men and society, that  the traffic on the Great North Road spoke to him in the  intervals of slumber.</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD CHAPTER III -  JONATHAN HOLDAWAY</p>
<p>NANCE descended the tower stair, pausing at every step.  She  was in no hurry to confront her uncle with bad news, and she  must dwell a little longer on the rich note of Mr. Archer&#x27;s  voice, the charm of his kind words, and the beauty of his  manner and person.  But, once at the stair-foot, she threw  aside the spell and recovered her sensible and workaday self.</p>
<p>Jonathan was seated in the middle of the settle, a mug of ale  beside him, in the attitude of one prepared for trouble; but  he did not speak, and suffered her to fetch her supper and  eat of it, with a very excellent appetite, in silence.  When  she had done, she, too, drew a tankard of home-brewed, and  came and planted herself in front of him upon the settle.</p>
<p>&#x27;Well?&#x27; said Jonathan.</p>
<p>&#x27;My lord has run away,&#x27; said Nance.</p>
<p>&#x27;What?&#x27; cried the old man.</p>
<p>&#x27;Abroad,&#x27; she continued; &#x27;run away from creditors.  He said  he had not a stiver, but he was drunk enough.  He said you  might live on in the castle, and Mr. Archer would pay you;  but you was to look for no more wages, since he would be glad  of them himself.&#x27;</p>
<p>Jonathan&#x27;s face contracted; the flush of a black, bilious  anger mounted to the roots of his hair; he gave an  inarticulate cry, leapt upon his feet, and began rapidly  pacing the stone floor.  At first he kept his hands behind  his back in a tight knot; then he began to gesticulate as he  turned.</p>
<p>&#x27;This man - this lord,&#x27; he shouted, &#x27;who is he?  He was born  with a gold spoon in his mouth, and I with a dirty straw.  He  rolled in his coach when he was a baby.  I have dug and  toiled and laboured since I was that high - that high.&#x27;  And  he shouted again.  &#x27;I&#x27;m bent and broke, and full of pains.   D&#x27; ye think I don&#x27;t know the taste of sweat?  Many&#x27;s the  gallon I&#x27;ve drunk of it - ay, in the midwinter, toiling like  a slave.  All through, what has my life been?  Bend, bend,  bend my old creaking back till it would ache like breaking;  wade about in the foul mire, never a dry stitch; empty belly,  sore hands, hat off to my Lord Redface; kicks and ha&#x27;pence;  and now, here, at the hind end, when I&#x27;m worn to my poor  bones, a kick and done with it.&#x27;  He walked a little while in  silence, and then, extending his hand, &#x27;Now you, Nance  Holdaway,&#x27; says he, &#x27;you come of my blood, and you&#x27;re a good  girl.  When that man was a boy, I used to carry his gun for  him.  I carried the gun all day on my two feet, and many a  stitch I had, and chewed a bullet for.  He rode upon a horse,  with feathers in his hat; but it was him that had the shots  and took the game home.  Did I complain?  Not I.  I knew my  station.  What did I ask, but just the chance to live and die  honest?  Nance Holdaway, don&#x27;t let them deny it to me - don&#x27;t  let them do it.  I&#x27;ve been as poor as Job, and as honest as  the day, but now, my girl, you mark these words of mine, I&#x27;m  getting tired of it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I wouldn&#x27;t say such words, at least,&#x27; said Nance.</p>
<p>&#x27;You wouldn&#x27;t?&#x27; said the old man grimly.  &#x27;Well, and did I  when I was your age?  Wait till your back&#x27;s broke and your  hands tremble, and your eyes fail, and you&#x27;re weary of the  battle and ask no more but to lie down in your bed and give  the ghost up like an honest man; and then let there up and  come some insolent, ungodly fellow - ah! if I had him in  these hands!  &quot;Where&#x27;s my money that you gambled?&quot; I should  say.  &quot;Where&#x27;s my money that you drank and diced?&quot;  &quot;Thief!&quot;  is what I would say; &quot;Thief!&quot;&#x27; he roared, &#x27;&quot;Thief&quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Mr. Archer will hear you if you don&#x27;t take care,&#x27; said  Nance, &#x27;and I would be ashamed, for one, that he should hear  a brave, old, honest, hard-working man like Jonathan Holdaway  talk nonsense like a boy.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;D&#x27; ye think I mind for Mr. Archer?&#x27; he cried shrilly, with a  clack of laughter; and then he came close up to her, stooped  down with his two palms upon his knees, and looked her in the  eyes, with a strange hard expression, something like a smile.   &#x27;Do I mind for God, my girl?&#x27; he said; &#x27;that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s come  to be now, do I mind for God?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Uncle Jonathan,&#x27; she said, getting up and taking him by the  arm; &#x27;you sit down again, where you were sitting.  There, sit  still; I&#x27;ll have no more of this; you&#x27;ll do yourself a  mischief.  Come, take a drink of this good ale, and I&#x27;ll warm  a tankard for you.  La, we&#x27;ll pull through, you&#x27;ll see.  I&#x27;m  young, as you say, and it&#x27;s my turn to carry the bundle; and  don&#x27;t you worry your bile, or we&#x27;ll have sickness, too, as  well as sorrow.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;D&#x27; ye think that I&#x27;d forgotten you?&#x27; said Jonathan, with  something like a groan; and thereupon his teeth clicked to,  and he sat silent with the tankard in his hand and staring  straight before him.</p>
<p>&#x27;Why,&#x27; says Nance, setting on the ale to mull, &#x27;men are  always children, they say, however old; and if ever I heard a  thing like this, to set to and make yourself sick, just when  the money&#x27;s failing.  Keep a good heart up; you haven&#x27;t kept  a good heart these seventy years, nigh hand, to break down  about a pound or two.  Here&#x27;s this Mr. Archer come to lodge,  that you disliked so much.  Well, now you see it was a clear  Providence.  Come, let&#x27;s think upon our mercies.  And here is  the ale mulling lovely; smell of it; I&#x27;ll take a drop myself,  it smells so sweet.  And, Uncle Jonathan, you let me say one  word.  You&#x27;ve lost more than money before now; you lost my  aunt, and bore it like a man.  Bear this.&#x27;</p>
<p>His face once more contracted; his fist doubled, and shot  forth into the air, and trembled.  &#x27;Let them look out!&#x27; he  shouted.  &#x27;Here, I warn all men; I&#x27;ve done with this foul  kennel of knaves.  Let them look out!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Hush, hush! for pity&#x27;s sake,&#x27; cried Nance.</p>
<p>And then all of a sudden he dropped his face into his hands,  and broke out with a great hiccoughing dry sob that was  horrible to hear.  &#x27;O,&#x27; he cried, &#x27;my God, if my son hadn&#x27;t  left me, if my Dick was here!&#x27; and the sobs shook him; Nance  sitting still and watching him, with distress.  &#x27;O, if he  were here to help his father!&#x27; he went on again.  &#x27;If I had a  son like other fathers, he would save me now, when all is  breaking down; O, he would save me!  Ay, but where is he?   Raking taverns, a thief perhaps.  My curse be on him!&#x27; he  added, rising again into wrath.</p>
<p>&#x27;Hush!&#x27; cried Nance, springing to her feet: &#x27;your boy, your  dead wife&#x27;s boy - Aunt Susan&#x27;s baby that she loved - would  you curse him?  O, God forbid!&#x27;</p>
<p>The energy of her address surprised him from his mood.  He  looked upon her, tearless and confused.  &#x27;Let me go to my  bed,&#x27; he said at last, and he rose, and, shaking as with  ague, but quite silent, lighted his candle, and left the  kitchen.</p>
<p>Poor Nance! the pleasant current of her dreams was all  diverted.  She beheld a golden city, where she aspired to  dwell; she had spoken with a deity, and had told herself that  she might rise to be his equal; and now the earthly ligaments  that bound her down had been tightened.  She was like a tree  looking skyward, her roots were in the ground.  It seemed to  her a thing so coarse, so rustic, to be thus concerned about  a loss in money; when Mr. Archer, fallen from the sky-level  of counts and nobles, faced his changed destiny with so  immovable a courage.  To weary of honesty; that, at least, no  one could do, but even to name it was already a disgrace; and  she beheld in fancy her uncle, and the young lad, all laced  and feathered, hand upon hip, bestriding his small horse.   The opposition seemed to perpetuate itself from generation to  generation; one side still doomed to the clumsy and the  servile, the other born to beauty.</p>
<p>She thought of the golden zones in which gentlemen were bred,  and figured with so excellent a grace; zones in which wisdom  and smooth words, white linen and slim hands, were the mark  of the desired inhabitants; where low temptations were  unknown, and honesty no virtue, but a thing as natural as  breathing.</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD CHAPTER IV - MINGLING THREADS</p>
<p>IT was nearly seven before Mr. Archer left his apartment.  On  the landing he found another door beside his own opening on a  roofless corridor, and presently he was walking on the top of  the ruins.  On one hand he could look down a good depth into  the green court-yard; on the other his eye roved along the  downward course of the river, the wet woods all smoking, the  shadows long and blue, the mists golden and rosy in the sun,  here and there the water flashing across an obstacle.  His  heart expanded and softened to a grateful melancholy, and  with his eye fixed upon the distance, and no thought of  present danger, he continued to stroll along the elevated and  treacherous promenade.</p>
<p>A terror-stricken cry rose to him from the courtyard.  He  looked down, and saw in a glimpse Nance standing below with  hands clasped in horror and his own foot trembling on the  margin of a gulf.  He recoiled and leant against a pillar,  quaking from head to foot, and covering his face with his  hands; and Nance had time to run round by the stair and  rejoin him where he stood before he had changed a line of his  position.</p>
<p>&#x27;Ah!&#x27; he cried, and clutched her wrist; &#x27;don&#x27;t leave me.  The  place rocks; I have no head for altitudes.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Sit down against that pillar,&#x27; said Nance.  &#x27;Don&#x27;t you be  afraid; I won&#x27;t leave you, and don&#x27;t look up or down: look  straight at me.  How white you are!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;The gulf,&#x27; he said, and closed his eyes again and shuddered.</p>
<p>&#x27;Why,&#x27; said Nance, &#x27;what a poor climber you must be!  That  was where my cousin Dick used to get out of the castle after  Uncle Jonathan had shut the gate.  I&#x27;ve been down there  myself with him helping me.  I wouldn&#x27;t try with you,&#x27; she  said, and laughed merrily.</p>
<p>The sound of her laughter was sincere and musical, and  perhaps its beauty barbed the offence to Mr. Archer.  The  blood came into his face with a quick jet, and then left it  paler than before.  &#x27;It is a physical weakness,&#x27; he said  harshly, &#x27;and very droll, no doubt, but one that I can  conquer on necessity.  See, I am still shaking.  Well, I  advance to the battlements and look down.  Show me your  cousin&#x27;s path.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;He would go sure-foot along that little ledge,&#x27; said Nance,  pointing as she spoke; &#x27;then out through the breach and down  by yonder buttress.  It is easier coming back, of course,  because you see where you are going.  From the buttress foot  a sheep-walk goes along the scarp - see, you can follow it  from here in the dry grass.  And now, sir,&#x27; she added, with a  touch of womanly pity, &#x27;I would come away from here if I were  you, for indeed you are not fit.&#x27;</p>
<p>Sure enough Mr. Archer&#x27;s pallor and agitation had continued  to increase; his cheeks were deathly, his clenched fingers  trembled pitifully.  &#x27;The weakness is physical,&#x27; he sighed,  and had nearly fallen.  Nance led him from the spot, and he  was no sooner back in the tower-stair, than he fell heavily  against the wall and put his arm across his eyes.  A cup of  brandy had to be brought him before he could descend to  breakfast; and the perfection of Nance&#x27;s dream was for the  first time troubled.</p>
<p>Jonathan was waiting for them at table, with yellow, blood- shot eyes and a peculiar dusky complexion.  He hardly waited  till they found their seats, before, raising one hand, and  stooping with his mouth above his plate, he put up a prayer  for a blessing on the food and a spirit of gratitude in the  eaters, and thereupon, and without more civility, fell to.   But it was notable that he was no less speedily satisfied  than he had been greedy to begin.  He pushed his plate away  and drummed upon the table.</p>
<p>&#x27;These are silly prayers,&#x27; said he, &#x27;that they teach us.  Eat  and be thankful, that&#x27;s no such wonder.  Speak to me of  starving - there&#x27;s the touch.  You&#x27;re a man, they tell me,  Mr. Archer, that has met with some reverses?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I have met with many,&#x27; replied Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>&#x27;Ha!&#x27; said Jonathan.  &#x27;None reckons but the last.  Now, see;  I tried to make this girl here understand me.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Uncle,&#x27; said Nance, &#x27;what should Mr. Archer care for your  concerns?  He hath troubles of his own, and came to be at  peace, I think.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I tried to make her understand me,&#x27; repeated Jonathan  doggedly; &#x27;and now I&#x27;ll try you.  Do you think this world is  fair?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Fair and false!&#x27; quoth Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>The old man laughed immoderately.  &#x27;Good,&#x27; said he, &#x27;very  good, but what I mean is this: do you know what it is to get  up early and go to bed late, and never take so much as a  holiday but four: and one of these your own marriage day, and  the other three the funerals of folk you loved, and all that,  to have a quiet old age in shelter, and bread for your old  belly, and a bed to lay your crazy bones upon, with a clear  conscience?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Sir,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, with an inclination of his head, &#x27;you  portray a very brave existence.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Well,&#x27; continued Jonathan, &#x27;and in the end thieves deceive  you, thieves rob and rook you, thieves turn you out in your  old age and send you begging.  What have you got for all your  honesty?  A fine return!  You that might have stole scores of  pounds, there you are out in the rain with your rheumatics!&#x27;</p>
<p>Mr. Archer had forgotten to eat; with his hand upon his chin  he was studying the old man&#x27;s countenance.  &#x27;And you  conclude?&#x27; he asked.</p>
<p>&#x27;Conclude!&#x27; cried Jonathan.  &#x27;I conclude I&#x27;ll be upsides with  them.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ay,&#x27; said the other, &#x27;we are all tempted to revenge.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;You have lost money?&#x27; asked Jonathan.</p>
<p>&#x27;A great estate,&#x27; said Archer quietly.</p>
<p>&#x27;See now!&#x27; says Jonathan, &#x27;and where is it?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Nay, I sometimes think that every one has had his share of  it but me,&#x27; was the reply.  &#x27;All England hath paid his taxes  with my patrimony: I was a sheep that left my wool on every  briar.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And you sit down under that?&#x27; cried the old man.  &#x27;Come now,  Mr. Archer, you and me belong to different stations; and I  know mine - no man better - but since we have both been  rooked, and are both sore with it, why, here&#x27;s my hand with a  very good heart, and I ask for yours, and no offence, I  hope.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;There is surely no offence, my friend,&#x27; returned Mr. Archer,  as they shook hands across the table; &#x27;for, believe me, my  sympathies are quite acquired to you.  This life is an arena  where we fight with beasts; and, indeed,&#x27; he added, sighing,  &#x27;I sometimes marvel why we go down to it unarmed.&#x27;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile a creaking of ungreased axles had been heard  descending through the wood; and presently after, the door  opened, and the tall ostler entered the kitchen carrying one  end of Mr. Archer&#x27;s trunk.  The other was carried by an aged  beggar man of that district, known and welcome for some  twenty miles about under the name of &#x27;Old Cumberland.&#x27;  Each  was soon perched upon a settle, with a cup of ale; and the  ostler, who valued himself upon his affability, began to  entertain the company, still with half an eye on Nance, to  whom in gallant terms he expressly dedicated every sip of  ale.  First he told of the trouble they had to get his  Lordship started in the chaise; and how he had dropped a  rouleau of gold on the threshold, and the passage and  doorstep had been strewn with guinea-pieces.  At this old  Jonathan looked at Mr. Archer.  Next the visitor turned to  news of a more thrilling character: how the down mail had  been stopped again near Grantham by three men on horseback -  a white and two bays; how they had handkerchiefs on their  faces; how Tom the guard&#x27;s blunderbuss missed fire, but he  swore he had winged one of them with a pistol; and how they  had got clean away with seventy pounds in money, some  valuable papers, and a watch or two.</p>
<p>&#x27;Brave! brave!&#x27; cried Jonathan in ecstasy.  &#x27;Seventy pounds!   O, it&#x27;s brave!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, I don&#x27;t see the great bravery,&#x27; observed the ostler,  misapprehending him.  &#x27;Three men, and you may call that three  to one.  I&#x27;ll call it brave when some one stops the mail  single-handed; that&#x27;s a risk.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And why should they hesitate?&#x27; inquired Mr. Archer.  &#x27;The  poor souls who are fallen to such a way of life, pray what  have they to lose?  If they get the money, well; but if a  ball should put them from their troubles, why, so better.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, sir,&#x27; said the ostler, &#x27;I believe you&#x27;ll find they  won&#x27;t agree with you.  They count on a good fling, you see;  or who would risk it? - And here&#x27;s my best respects to you,  Miss Nance.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And I forgot the part of cowardice,&#x27; resumed Mr. Archer.   &#x27;All men fear.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;O, surely not!&#x27; cried Nance.</p>
<p>&#x27;All men,&#x27; reiterated Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>&#x27;Ay, that&#x27;s a true word,&#x27; observed Old Cumberland, &#x27;and a  thief, anyway, for it&#x27;s a coward&#x27;s trade.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;But these fellows, now,&#x27; said Jonathan, with a curious,  appealing manner - &#x27;these fellows with their seventy pounds!   Perhaps, Mr. Archer, they were no true thieves after all, but  just people who had been robbed and tried to get their own  again.  What was that you said, about all England and the  taxes?  One takes, another gives; why, that&#x27;s almost fair.   If I&#x27;ve been rooked and robbed, and the coat taken off my  back, I call it almost fair to take another&#x27;s.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ask Old Cumberland,&#x27; observed the ostler; &#x27;you ask Old  Cumberland, Miss Nance!&#x27; and he bestowed a wink upon his  favoured fair one.</p>
<p>&#x27;Why that?&#x27; asked Jonathan.</p>
<p>&#x27;He had his coat taken - ay, and his shirt too,&#x27; returned the  ostler.</p>
<p>&#x27;Is that so?&#x27; cried Jonathan eagerly.  &#x27;Was you robbed too?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;That was I,&#x27; replied Cumberland, &#x27;with a warrant!  I was a  well-to-do man when I was young.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ay!  See that!&#x27; says Jonathan.  &#x27;And you don&#x27;t long for a  revenge?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Eh!  Not me!&#x27; answered the beggar.  &#x27;It&#x27;s too long ago.  But  if you&#x27;ll give me another mug of your good ale, my pretty  lady, I won&#x27;t say no to that.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And shalt have!  And shalt have!&#x27; cried Jonathan.  &#x27;Or  brandy even, if you like it better.&#x27;</p>
<p>And as Cumberland did like it better, and the ostler chimed  in, the party pledged each other in a dram of brandy before  separating.</p>
<p>As for Nance, she slipped forth into the ruins, partly to  avoid the ostler&#x27;s gallantries, partly to lament over the  defects of Mr. Archer.  Plainly, he was no hero.  She pitied  him; she began to feel a protecting interest mingle with and  almost supersede her admiration, and was at the same time  disappointed and yet drawn to him.  She was, indeed,  conscious of such unshaken fortitude in her own heart, that  she was almost tempted by an occasion to be bold for two.   She saw herself, in a brave attitude, shielding her imperfect  hero from the world; and she saw, like a piece of heaven, his  gratitude for her protection.</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD CHAPTER V - LIFE IN THE CASTLE</p>
<p>FROM that day forth the life of these three persons in the  ruin ran very smoothly.  Mr. Archer now sat by the fire with  a book, and now passed whole days abroad, returning late,  dead weary.  His manner was a mask; but it was half  transparent; through the even tenor of his gravity and  courtesy profound revolutions of feeling were betrayed,  seasons of numb despair, of restlessness, of aching temper.   For days he would say nothing beyond his usual courtesies and  solemn compliments; and then, all of a sudden, some fine  evening beside the kitchen fire, he would fall into a vein of  elegant gossip, tell of strange and interesting events, the  secrets of families, brave deeds of war, the miraculous  discovery of crime, the visitations of the dead.  Nance and  her uncle would sit till the small hours with eyes wide open:  Jonathan applauding the unexpected incidents with many a slap  of his big hand; Nance, perhaps, more pleased with the  narrator&#x27;s eloquence and wise reflections; and then, again,  days would follow of abstraction, of listless humming, of  frequent apologies and long hours of silence.  Once only, and  then after a week of unrelieved melancholy, he went over to  the &#x27;Green Dragon,&#x27; spent the afternoon with the landlord and  a bowl of punch, and returned as on the first night, devious  in step but courteous and unperturbed of speech.</p>
<p>If he seemed more natural and more at his ease it was when he  found Nance alone; and, laying by some of his reserve, talked  before her rather than to her of his destiny, character and  hopes.  To Nance these interviews were but a doubtful  privilege.  At times he would seem to take a pleasure in her  presence, to consult her gravely, to hear and to discuss her  counsels; at times even, but these were rare and brief, he  would talk of herself, praise the qualities that she  possessed, touch indulgently on her defects, and lend her  books to read and even examine her upon her reading; but far  more often he would fall into a half unconsciousness, put her  a question and then answer it himself, drop into the veiled  tone of voice of one soliloquising, and leave her at last as  though he had forgotten her existence.  It was odd, too, that  in all this random converse, not a fact of his past life, and  scarce a name, should ever cross his lips.  A profound  reserve kept watch upon his most unguarded moments.  He spoke  continually of himself, indeed, but still in enigmas; a  veiled prophet of egoism.</p>
<p>The base of Nance&#x27;s feelings for Mr. Archer was admiration as  for a superior being; and with this, his treatment,  consciously or not, accorded happily.  When he forgot her,  she took the blame upon herself.  His formal politeness was  so exquisite that this essential brutality stood excused.   His compliments, besides, were always grave and rational; he  would offer reason for his praise, convict her of merit, and  thus disarm suspicion.  Nay, and the very hours when he  forgot and remembered her alternately could by the ardent  fallacies of youth be read in the light of an attention.  She  might be far from his confidence; but still she was nearer it  than any one.  He might ignore her presence, but yet he  sought it.</p>
<p>Moreover, she, upon her side, was conscious of one point of  superiority.  Beside this rather dismal, rather effeminate  man, who recoiled from a worm, who grew giddy on the castle  wall, who bore so helplessly the weight of his misfortunes,  she felt herself a head and shoulders taller in cheerful and  sterling courage.  She could walk head in air along the most  precarious rafter; her hand feared neither the grossness nor  the harshness of life&#x27;s web, but was thrust cheerfully, if  need were, into the briar bush, and could take hold of any  crawling horror.  Ruin was mining the walls of her cottage,  as already it had mined and subverted Mr. Archer&#x27;s palace.   Well, she faced it with a bright countenance and a busy hand.   She had got some washing, some rough seamstress work from the  &#x27;Green Dragon,&#x27; and from another neighbour ten miles away  across the moor.  At this she cheerfully laboured, and from  that height she could afford to pity the useless talents and  poor attitude of Mr. Archer.  It did not change her  admiration, but it made it bearable.  He was above her in all  ways; but she was above him in one.  She kept it to herself,  and hugged it.  When, like all young creatures, she made long  stories to justify, to nourish, and to forecast the course of  her affection, it was this private superiority that made all  rosy, that cut the knot, and that, at last, in some great  situation, fetched to her knees the dazzling but imperfect  hero.  With this pretty exercise she beguiled the hours of  labour, and consoled herself for Mr. Archer&#x27;s bearing.</p>
<p>Pity was her weapon and her weakness.  To accept the loved  one&#x27;s faults, although it has an air of freedom, is to kiss  the chain, and this pity it was which, lying nearer to her  heart, lent the one element of true emotion to a fanciful and  merely brain-sick love.</p>
<p>Thus it fell out one day that she had gone to the &#x27;Green  Dragon&#x27; and brought back thence a letter to Mr. Archer.  He,  upon seeing it, winced like a man under the knife: pain,  shame, sorrow, and the most trenchant edge of mortification  cut into his heart and wrung the steady composure of his  face.</p>
<p>&#x27;Dear heart! have you bad news?&#x27; she cried.</p>
<p>But he only replied by a gesture and fled to his room, and  when, later on, she ventured to refer to it, he stopped her  on the threshold, as if with words prepared beforehand.   &#x27;There are some pains,&#x27; said he, &#x27;too acute for consolation,  or I would bring them to my kind consoler.  Let the memory of  that letter, if you please, be buried.&#x27;  And then as she  continued to gaze at him, being, in spite of herself, pained  by his elaborate phrase, doubtfully sincere in word and  manner: &#x27;Let it be enough,&#x27; he added haughtily, &#x27;that if this  matter wring my heart, it doth not touch my conscience.  I am  a man, I would have you to know, who suffers undeservedly.&#x27;</p>
<p>He had never spoken so directly: never with so convincing an  emotion; and her heart thrilled for him.  She could have  taken his pains and died of them with joy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she was left without support.  Jonathan now swore  by his lodger, and lived for him.  He was a fine talker.  He  knew the finest sight of stories; he was a man and a  gentleman, take him for all in all, and a perfect credit to  Old England.  Such were the old man&#x27;s declared sentiments,  and sure enough he clung to Mr. Archer&#x27;s side, hung upon his  utterance when he spoke, and watched him with unwearing  interest when he was silent.  And yet his feeling was not  clear; in the partial wreck of his mind, which was leaning to  decay, some after-thought was strongly present.  As he gazed  in Mr. Archer&#x27;s face a sudden brightness would kindle in his  rheumy eyes, his eye-brows would lift as with a sudden  thought, his mouth would open as though to speak, and close  again on silence.  Once or twice he even called Mr. Archer  mysteriously forth into the dark courtyard, took him by the  button, and laid a demonstrative finger on his chest; but  there his ideas or his courage failed him; he would  shufflingly excuse himself and return to his position by the  fire without a word of explanation.  &#x27;The good man was  growing old,&#x27; said Mr. Archer with a suspicion of a shrug.   But the good man had his idea, and even when he was alone the  name of Mr. Archer fell from his lips continually in the  course of mumbled and gesticulative conversation.</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD CHAPTER VI - THE BAD HALF-CROWN</p>
<p>HOWEVER early Nance arose, and she was no sluggard, the old  man, who had begun to outlive the earthly habit of slumber,  would usually have been up long before, the fire would be  burning brightly, and she would see him wandering among the  ruins, lantern in hand, and talking assiduously to himself.   One day, however, after he had returned late from the market  town, she found that she had stolen a march upon that  indefatigable early riser.  The kitchen was all blackness.   She crossed the castle-yard to the wood-cellar, her steps  printing the thick hoarfrost.  A scathing breeze blew out of  the north-east and slowly carried a regiment of black and  tattered clouds over the face of heaven, which was already  kindled with the wild light of morning, but where she walked,  in shelter of the ruins, the flame of her candle burned  steady.  The extreme cold smote upon her conscience.  She  could not bear to think this bitter business fell usually to  the lot of one so old as Jonathan, and made desperate  resolutions to be earlier in the future.</p>
<p>The fire was a good blaze before he entered, limping dismally  into the kitchen.  &#x27;Nance,&#x27; said he, &#x27;I be all knotted up  with the rheumatics; will you rub me a bit?&#x27;  She came and  rubbed him where and how he bade her.  &#x27;This is a cruel thing  that old age should be rheumaticky,&#x27; said he.  &#x27;When I was  young I stood my turn of the teethache like a man! for why?  because it couldn&#x27;t last for ever; but these rheumatics come  to live and die with you.  Your aunt was took before the time  came; never had an ache to mention.  Now I lie all night in  my single bed and the blood never warms in me; this knee of  mine it seems like lighted up with rheumatics; it seems as  though you could see to sew by it; and all the strings of my  old body ache, as if devils was pulling &#x27;em.  Thank you  kindly; that&#x27;s someways easier now, but an old man, my dear,  has little to look for; it&#x27;s pain, pain, pain to the end of  the business, and I&#x27;ll never be rightly warm again till I get  under the sod,&#x27; he said, and looked down at her with a face  so aged and weary that she had nearly wept.</p>
<p>&#x27;I lay awake all night,&#x27; he continued; &#x27;I do so mostly, and a  long walk kills me.  Eh, deary me, to think that life should  run to such a puddle!  And I remember long syne when I was  strong, and the blood all hot and good about me, and I loved  to run, too - deary me, to run!  Well, that&#x27;s all by.  You&#x27;d  better pray to be took early, Nance, and not live on till you  get to be like me, and are robbed in your grey old age, your  cold, shivering, dark old age, that&#x27;s like a winter&#x27;s  morning&#x27;; and he bitterly shuddered, spreading his hands  before the fire.</p>
<p>&#x27;Come now,&#x27; said Nance, &#x27;the more you say the less you&#x27;ll  like it, Uncle Jonathan; but if I were you I would be proud  for to have lived all your days honest and beloved, and come  near the end with your good name: isn&#x27;t that a fine thing to  be proud of?  Mr. Archer was telling me in some strange land  they used to run races each with a lighted candle, and the  art was to keep the candle burning.  Well, now, I thought  that was like life: a man&#x27;s good conscience is the flame he  gets to carry, and if he comes to the winning-post with that  still burning, why, take it how you will, the man&#x27;s a hero -  even if he was low-born like you and me.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Did Mr. Archer tell you that?&#x27; asked Jonathan.</p>
<p>&#x27;No, dear,&#x27; said she, &#x27;that&#x27;s my own thought about it.  He  told me of the race.  But see, now,&#x27; she continued, putting  on the porridge, &#x27;you say old age is a hard season, but so is  youth.  You&#x27;re half out of the battle, I would say; you loved  my aunt and got her, and buried her, and some of these days  soon you&#x27;ll go to meet her; and take her my love and tell her  I tried to take good care of you; for so I do, Uncle  Jonathan.&#x27;</p>
<p>Jonathan struck with his fist upon the settle.  &#x27;D&#x27; ye think  I want to die, ye vixen?&#x27; he shouted.  &#x27;I want to live ten  hundred years.&#x27;</p>
<p>This was a mystery beyond Nance&#x27;s penetration, and she stared  in wonder as she made the porridge.</p>
<p>&#x27;I want to live,&#x27; he continued, &#x27;I want to live and to grow  rich.  I want to drive my carriage and to dice in hells and  see the ring, I do.  Is this a life that I lived?  I want to  be a rake, d&#x27; ye understand?  I want to know what things are  like.  I don&#x27;t want to die like a blind kitten, and me  seventy-six.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;O fie!&#x27; said Nance.</p>
<p>The old man thrust out his jaw at her, with the grimace of an  irreverent schoolboy.  Upon that aged face it seemed a  blasphemy.  Then he took out of his bosom a long leather  purse, and emptying its contents on the settle, began to  count and recount the pieces, ringing and examining each, and  suddenly he leapt like a young man.  &#x27;What!&#x27; he screamed.   &#x27;Bad?  O Lord!  I&#x27;m robbed again!&#x27;  And falling on his knees  before the settle he began to pour forth the most dreadful  curses on the head of his deceiver.  His eyes were shut, for  to him this vile solemnity was prayer.  He held up the bad  half-crown in his right hand, as though he were displaying it  to Heaven, and what increased the horror of the scene, the  curses he invoked were those whose efficacy he had tasted -  old age and poverty, rheumatism and an ungrateful son.  Nance  listened appalled; then she sprang forward and dragged down  his arm and laid her hand upon his mouth.</p>
<p>&#x27;Whist!&#x27; she cried.  &#x27;Whist ye, for God&#x27;s sake!  O my man,  whist ye!  If Heaven were to hear; if poor Aunt Susan were to  hear!  Think, she may be listening.&#x27;  And with the  histrionism of strong emotion she pointed to a corner of the  kitchen.</p>
<p>His eyes followed her finger.  He looked there for a little,  thinking, blinking; then he got stiffly to his feet and  resumed his place upon the settle, the bad piece still in his  hand.  So he sat for some time, looking upon the half-crown,  and now wondering to himself on the injustice and partiality  of the law, now computing again and again the nature of his  loss.  So he was still sitting when Mr. Archer entered the  kitchen.  At this a light came into his face, and after some  seconds of rumination he dispatched Nance upon an errand.</p>
<p>&#x27;Mr. Archer,&#x27; said he, as soon as they were alone together,  &#x27;would you give me a guinea-piece for silver?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Why, sir, I believe I can,&#x27; said Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>And the exchange was just effected when Nance re-entered the  apartment.  The blood shot into her face.</p>
<p>&#x27;What&#x27;s to do here?&#x27; she asked rudely.</p>
<p>&#x27;Nothing, my dearie,&#x27; said old Jonathan, with a touch of  whine.</p>
<p>&#x27;What&#x27;s to do?&#x27; she said again.</p>
<p>&#x27;Your uncle was but changing me a piece of gold,&#x27; returned  Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>&#x27;Let me see what he hath given you, Mr. Archer,&#x27; replied the  girl.  &#x27;I had a bad piece, and I fear it is mixed up among  the good.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, well,&#x27; replied Mr. Archer, smiling, &#x27;I must take the  merchant&#x27;s risk of it.  The money is now mixed.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I know my piece,&#x27; quoth Nance.  &#x27;Come, let me see your  silver, Mr. Archer.  If I have to get it by a theft I&#x27;ll see  that money,&#x27; she cried.</p>
<p>&#x27;Nay, child, if you put as much passion to be honest as the  world to steal, I must give way, though I betray myself,&#x27;  said Mr. Archer.  &#x27;There it is as I received it.&#x27;</p>
<p>Nance quickly found the bad half-crown.</p>
<p>&#x27;Give him another,&#x27; she said, looking Jonathan in the face;  and when that had been done, she walked over to the chimney  and flung the guilty piece into the reddest of the fire.  Its  base constituents began immediately to run; even as she  watched it the disc crumbled, and the lineaments of the King  became confused.  Jonathan, who had followed close behind,  beheld these changes from over her shoulder, and his face  darkened sorely.</p>
<p>&#x27;Now,&#x27; said she, &#x27;come back to table, and to-day it is I that  shall say grace, as I used to do in the old times, day about  with Dick&#x27;; and covering her eyes with one hand, &#x27;O Lord,&#x27;  said she with deep emotion, &#x27;make us thankful; and, O Lord,  deliver us from evil!  For the love of the poor souls that  watch for us in heaven, O deliver us from evil.&#x27;</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD CHAPTER VII - THE BLEACHING-GREEN</p>
<p>THE year moved on to March; and March, though it blew bitter  keen from the North Sea, yet blinked kindly between whiles on  the river dell.  The mire dried up in the closest covert;  life ran in the bare branches, and the air of the afternoon  would be suddenly sweet with the fragrance of new grass.</p>
<p>Above and below the castle the river crooked like the letter  &#x27;S.&#x27;  The lower loop was to the left, and embraced the high  and steep projection which was crowned by the ruins; the  upper loop enclosed a lawny promontory, fringed by thorn and  willow.  It was easy to reach it from the castle side, for  the river ran in this part very quietly among innumerable  boulders and over dam-like walls of rock.  The place was all  enclosed, the wind a stranger, the turf smooth and solid; so  it was chosen by Nance to be her bleaching-green.</p>
<p>One day she brought a bucketful of linen, and had but begun  to wring and lay them out when Mr. Archer stepped from the  thicket on the far side, drew very deliberately near, and sat  down in silence on the grass.  Nance looked up to greet him  with a smile, but finding her smile was not returned, she  fell into embarrassment and stuck the more busily to her  employment.  Man or woman, the whole world looks well at any  work to which they are accustomed; but the girl was ashamed  of what she did.  She was ashamed, besides, of the sun-bonnet  that so well became her, and ashamed of her bare arms, which  were her greatest beauty.</p>
<p>&#x27;Nausicaa,&#x27; said Mr. Archer at last, &#x27;I find you like  Nausicaa.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And who was she?&#x27; asked Nance, and laughed in spite of  herself, an empty and embarrassed laugh, that sounded in Mr.  Archer&#x27;s ears, indeed, like music, but to her own like the  last grossness of rusticity.</p>
<p>&#x27;She was a princess of the Grecian islands,&#x27; he replied.  &#x27;A  king, being shipwrecked, found her washing by the shore.   Certainly I, too, was shipwrecked,&#x27; he continued, plucking at  the grass.  &#x27;There was never a more desperate castaway - to  fall from polite life, fortune, a shrine of honour, a  grateful conscience, duties willingly taken up and faithfully  discharged; and to fall to this - idleness, poverty,  inutility, remorse.&#x27;  He seemed to have forgotten her  presence, but here he remembered her again.  &#x27;Nance,&#x27; said  he, &#x27;would you have a man sit down and suffer or rise up and  strive?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Nay,&#x27; she said.  &#x27;I would always rather see him doing.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ha!&#x27; said Mr. Archer, &#x27;but yet you speak from an imperfect  knowledge.  Conceive a man damned to a choice of only evil -  misconduct upon either side, not a fault behind him, and yet  naught before him but this choice of sins.  How would you say  then?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I would say that he was much deceived, Mr. Archer,&#x27; returned  Nance.  &#x27;I would say there was a third choice, and that the  right one.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I tell you,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, &#x27;the man I have in view hath  two ways open, and no more.  One to wait, like a poor mewling  baby, till Fate save or ruin him; the other to take his  troubles in his hand, and to perish or be saved at once.  It  is no point of morals; both are wrong.  Either way this step- child of Providence must fall; which shall he choose, by  doing or not doing?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Fall, then, is what I would say,&#x27; replied Nance.  &#x27;Fall  where you will, but do it!  For O, Mr. Archer,&#x27; she  continued, stooping to her work, &#x27;you that are good and kind,  and so wise, it doth sometimes go against my heart to see you  live on here like a sheep in a turnip-field!  If you were  braver - &#x27; and here she paused, conscience-smitten.</p>
<p>&#x27;Do I, indeed, lack courage?&#x27; inquired Mr. Archer of himself.   &#x27;Courage, the footstool of the virtues, upon which they  stand?  Courage, that a poor private carrying a musket has to  spare of; that does not fail a weasel or a rat; that is a  brutish faculty?  I to fail there, I wonder?  But what is  courage, then?  The constancy to endure oneself or to see  others suffer?  The itch of ill-advised activity: mere  shuttle-wittedness, or to be still and patient?  To inquire  of the significance of words is to rob ourselves of what we  seem to know, and yet, of all things, certainly to stand  still is the least heroic.  Nance,&#x27; he said, &#x27;did you ever  hear of HAMLET?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Never,&#x27; said Nance.</p>
<p>&#x27;&#x27;Tis an old play,&#x27; returned Mr. Archer, &#x27;and frequently  enacted.  This while I have been talking Hamlet.  You must  know this Hamlet was a Prince among the Danes,&#x27; and he told  her the play in a very good style, here and there quoting a  verse or two with solemn emphasis.</p>
<p>&#x27;It is strange,&#x27; said Nance; &#x27;he was then a very poor  creature?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;That was what he could not tell,&#x27; said Mr. Archer.  &#x27;Look at  me, am I as poor a creature?&#x27;</p>
<p>She looked, and what she saw was the familiar thought of all  her hours; the tall figure very plainly habited in black, the  spotless ruffles, the slim hands; the long, well-shapen,  serious, shaven face, the wide and somewhat thin-lipped  mouth, the dark eyes that were so full of depth and change  and colour.  He was gazing at her with his brows a little  knit, his chin upon one hand and that elbow resting on his  knee.</p>
<p>&#x27;Ye look a man!&#x27; she cried, &#x27;ay, and should be a great one!   The more shame to you to lie here idle like a dog before the  fire.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;My fair Holdaway,&#x27; quoth Mr. Archer, &#x27;you are much set on  action.  I cannot dig, to beg I am ashamed.&#x27;  He continued,  looking at her with a half-absent fixity, &#x27;&#x27;Tis a strange  thing, certainly, that in my years of fortune I should never  taste happiness, and now when I am broke, enjoy so much of  it, for was I ever happier than to-day?  Was the grass  softer, the stream pleasanter in sound, the air milder, the  heart more at peace?  Why should I not sink?  To dig - why,  after all, it should be easy.  To take a mate, too?  Love is  of all grades since Jupiter; love fails to none; and  children&#x27; - but here he passed his hand suddenly over his  eyes.  &#x27;O fool and coward, fool and coward!&#x27; he said  bitterly; &#x27;can you forget your fetters?  You did not know  that I was fettered, Nance?&#x27; he asked, again addressing her.</p>
<p>But Nance was somewhat sore.  &#x27;I know you keep talking,&#x27; she  said, and, turning half away from him, began to wring out a  sheet across her shoulder.  &#x27;I wonder you are not wearied of  your voice.  When the hands lie abed the tongue takes a  walk.&#x27;</p>
<p>Mr. Archer laughed unpleasantly, rose and moved to the  water&#x27;s edge.  In this part the body of the river poured  across a little narrow fell, ran some ten feet very smoothly  over a bed of pebbles, then getting wind, as it were, of  another shelf of rock which barred the channel, began, by  imperceptible degrees, to separate towards either shore in  dancing currents, and to leave the middle clear and stagnant.   The set towards either side was nearly equal; about one half  of the whole water plunged on the side of the castle, through  a narrow gullet; about one half ran ripping past the margin  of the green and slipped across a babbling rapid.</p>
<p>&#x27;Here,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, after he had looked for some time at  the fine and shifting demarcation of these currents, &#x27;come  here and see me try my fortune.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I am not like a man,&#x27; said Nance; &#x27;I have no time to waste.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Come here,&#x27; he said again.  &#x27;I ask you seriously, Nance.  We  are not always childish when we seem so.&#x27;</p>
<p>She drew a little nearer.</p>
<p>&#x27;Now,&#x27; said he, &#x27;you see these two channels - choose one.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I&#x27;ll choose the nearest, to save time,&#x27; said Nance.</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, that shall be for action,&#x27; returned Mr. Archer.  &#x27;And  since I wish to have the odds against me, not only the other  channel but yon stagnant water in the midst shall be for  lying still.  You see this?&#x27; he continued, pulling up a  withered rush.  &#x27;I break it in three.  I shall put each  separately at the top of the upper fall, and according as  they go by your way or by the other I shall guide my life.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;This is very silly,&#x27; said Nance, with a movement of her  shoulders.</p>
<p>&#x27;I do not think it so,&#x27; said Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>&#x27;And then,&#x27; she resumed, &#x27;if you are to try your fortune, why  not evenly?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Nay,&#x27; returned Mr. Archer with a smile, &#x27;no man can put  complete reliance in blind fate; he must still cog the dice.&#x27;</p>
<p>By this time he had got upon the rock beside the upper fall,  and, bidding her look out, dropped a piece of rush into the  middle of the intake.  The rusty fragment was sucked at once  over the fall, came up again far on the right hand, leaned  ever more and more in the same direction, and disappeared  under the hanging grasses on the castle side.</p>
<p>&#x27;One,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, &#x27;one for standing still.&#x27;</p>
<p>But the next launch had a different fate, and after hanging  for a while about the edge of the stagnant water, steadily  approached the bleaching-green and danced down the rapid  under Nance&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#x27;One for me,&#x27; she cried with some exultation; and then she  observed that Mr. Archer had grown pale, and was kneeling on  the rock, with his hand raised like a person petrified.   &#x27;Why,&#x27; said she, &#x27;you do not mind it, do you?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Does a man not mind a throw of dice by which a fortune  hangs?&#x27; said Mr. Archer, rather hoarsely.  &#x27;And this is more  than fortune.  Nance, if you have any kindness for my fate,  put up a prayer before I launch the next one.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;A prayer,&#x27; she cried, &#x27;about a game like this?  I would not  be so heathen.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Well,&#x27; said he, &#x27;then without,&#x27; and he closed his eyes and  dropped the piece of rush.  This time there was no doubt.  It  went for the rapid as straight as any arrow.</p>
<p>&#x27;Action then!&#x27; said Mr. Archer, getting to his feet; &#x27;and  then God forgive us,&#x27; he added, almost to himself.</p>
<p>&#x27;God forgive us, indeed,&#x27; cried Nance, &#x27;for wasting the good  daylight!  But come, Mr. Archer, if I see you look so serious  I shall begin to think you was in earnest.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Nay,&#x27; he said, turning upon her suddenly, with a full smile;  &#x27;but is not this good advice?  I have consulted God and  demigod; the nymph of the river, and what I far more admire  and trust, my blue-eyed Minerva.  Both have said the same.   My own heart was telling it already.  Action, then, be mine;  and into the deep sea with all this paralysing casuistry.  I  am happy to-day for the first time.&#x27;</p>
<p>THE GREAT NORTH ROAD CHAPTER VIII - THE MAIL GUARD</p>
<p>SOMEWHERE about two in the morning a squall had burst upon  the castle, a clap of screaming wind that made the towers  rock, and a copious drift of rain that streamed from the  windows.  The wind soon blew itself out, but the day broke  cloudy and dripping, and when the little party assembled at  breakfast their humours appeared to have changed with the  change of weather.  Nance had been brooding on the scene at  the river-side, applying it in various ways to her particular  aspirations, and the result, which was hardly to her mind,  had taken the colour out of her cheeks.  Mr. Archer, too, was  somewhat absent, his thoughts were of a mingled strain; and  even upon his usually impassive countenance there were  betrayed successive depths of depression and starts of  exultation, which the girl translated in terms of her own  hopes and fears.  But Jonathan was the most altered: he was  strangely silent, hardly passing a word, and watched Mr.  Archer with an eager and furtive eye.  It seemed as if the  idea that had so long hovered before him had now taken a more  solid shape, and, while it still attracted, somewhat alarmed  his imagination.</p>
<p>At this rate, conversation languished into a silence which  was only broken by the gentle and ghostly noises of the rain  on the stone roof and about all that field of ruins; and they  were all relieved when the note of a man whistling and the  sound of approaching footsteps in the grassy court announced  a visitor.  It was the ostler from the &#x27;Green Dragon&#x27;  bringing a letter for Mr. Archer.  Nance saw her hero&#x27;s face  contract and then relax again at sight of it; and she thought  that she knew why, for the sprawling, gross black characters  of the address were easily distinguishable from the fine  writing on the former letter that had so much disturbed him.   He opened it and began to read; while the ostler sat down to  table with a pot of ale, and proceeded to make himself  agreeable after his fashion.</p>
<p>&#x27;Fine doings down our way, Miss Nance,&#x27; said he.  &#x27;I haven&#x27;t  been abed this blessed night.&#x27;</p>
<p>Nance expressed a polite interest, but her eye was on Mr.  Archer, who was reading his letter with a face of such  extreme indifference that she was tempted to suspect him of  assumption.</p>
<p>&#x27;Yes,&#x27; continued the ostler, &#x27;not been the like of it this  fifteen years: the North Mail stopped at the three stones.&#x27;</p>
<p>Jonathan&#x27;s cup was at his lip, but at this moment he choked  with a great splutter; and Mr. Archer, as if startled by the  noise, made so sudden a movement that one corner of the sheet  tore off and stayed between his finger and thumb.  It was  some little time before the old man was sufficiently  recovered to beg the ostler to go on, and he still kept  coughing and crying and rubbing his eyes.  Mr. Archer, on his  side, laid the letter down, and, putting his hands in his  pocket, listened gravely to the tale.</p>
<p>&#x27;Yes,&#x27; resumed Sam, &#x27;the North Mail was stopped by a single  horseman; dash my wig, but I admire him!  There were four  insides and two out, and poor Tom Oglethorpe, the guard.  Tom  showed himself a man; let fly his blunderbuss at him; had him  covered, too, and could swear to that; but the Captain never  let on, up with a pistol and fetched poor Tom a bullet  through the body.  Tom, he squelched upon the seat, all over  blood.  Up comes the Captain to the window.  &quot;Oblige me,&quot;  says he, &quot;with what you have.&quot;  Would you believe it?  Not a  man says cheep! - not them.  &quot;Thy hands over thy head.&quot;  Four  watches, rings, snuff-boxes, seven-and-forty pounds overhead  in gold.  One Dicksee, a grazier, tries it on: gives him a  guinea.  &quot;Beg your pardon,&quot; says the Captain, &quot;I think too  highly of you to take it at your hand.  I will not take less  than ten from such a gentleman.&quot;  This Dicksee had his money  in his stocking, but there was the pistol at his eye.  Down  he goes, offs with his stocking, and there was thirty golden  guineas.  &quot;Now,&quot; says the Captain, &quot;you&#x27;ve tried it on with  me, but I scorns the advantage.  Ten I said,&quot; he says, &quot;and  ten I take.&quot;  So, dash my buttons, I call that man a man!&#x27;  cried Sam in cordial admiration.</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, and then?&#x27; says Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>&#x27;Then,&#x27; resumed Sam, &#x27;that old fat fagot Engleton, him as  held the ribbons and drew up like a lamb when he was told to,  picks up his cattle, and drives off again.  Down they came to  the &quot;Dragon,&quot; all singing like as if they was scalded, and  poor Tom saying nothing.  You would &#x27;a&#x27; thought they had all  lost the King&#x27;s crown to hear them.  Down gets this Dicksee.   &quot;Postmaster,&quot; he says, taking him by the arm, &quot;this is a most  abominable thing,&quot; he says.  Down gets a Major Clayton, and  gets the old man by the other arm.  &quot;We&#x27;ve been robbed,&quot; he  cries, &quot;robbed!&quot;  Down gets the others, and all around the  old man telling their story, and what they had lost, and how  they was all as good as ruined; till at last Old Engleton  says, says he, &quot;How about Oglethorpe?&quot; says he.  &quot;Ay,&quot; says  the others, &quot;how about the guard?&quot;  Well, with that we  bousted him down, as white as a rag and all blooded like a  sop.  I thought he was dead.  Well, he ain&#x27;t dead; but he&#x27;s  dying, I fancy.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Did you say four watches?&#x27; said Jonathan.</p>
<p>&#x27;Four, I think.  I wish it had been forty,&#x27; cried Sam.  &#x27;Such  a party of soused herrings I never did see - not a man among  them bar poor Tom.  But us that are the servants on the road  have all the risk and none of the profit.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And this brave fellow,&#x27; asked Mr. Archer, very quietly,  &#x27;this Oglethorpe - how is he now?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, sir, with my respects, I take it he has a hole bang  through him,&#x27; said Sam.  &#x27;The doctor hasn&#x27;t been yet.  He&#x27;d  &#x27;a&#x27; been bright and early if it had been a passenger.  But,  doctor or no, I&#x27;ll make a good guess that Tom won&#x27;t see to- morrow.  He&#x27;ll die on a Sunday, will poor Tom; and they do  say that&#x27;s fortunate.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Did Tom see him that did it?&#x27; asked Jonathan.</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, he saw him,&#x27; replied Sam, &#x27;but not to swear by.  Said  he was a very tall man, and very big, and had a &#x27;ankerchief  about his face, and a very quick shot, and sat his horse like  a thorough gentleman, as he is.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;A gentleman!&#x27; cried Nance.  &#x27;The dirty knave!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, I calls a man like that a gentleman,&#x27; returned the  ostler; &#x27;that&#x27;s what I mean by a gentleman.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;You don&#x27;t know much of them, then,&#x27; said Nance.</p>
<p>&#x27;A gentleman would scorn to stoop to such a thing.  I call my  uncle a better gentleman than any thief.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And you would be right,&#x27; said Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>&#x27;How many snuff-boxes did he get?&#x27; asked Jonathan.</p>
<p>&#x27;O, dang me if I know,&#x27; said Sam; &#x27;I didn&#x27;t take an  inventory.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I will go back with you, if you please,&#x27; said Mr. Archer.   &#x27;I should like to see poor Oglethorpe.  He has behaved well.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;At your service, sir,&#x27; said Sam, jumping to his feet.  &#x27;I  dare to say a gentleman like you would not forget a poor  fellow like Tom - no, nor a plain man like me, sir, that went  without his sleep to nurse him.  And excuse me, sir,&#x27; added  Sam, &#x27;you won&#x27;t forget about the letter neither?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Surely not,&#x27; said Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>Oglethorpe lay in a low bed, one of several in a long garret  of the inn.  The rain soaked in places through the roof and  fell in minute drops; there was but one small window; the  beds were occupied by servants, the air of the garret was  both close and chilly.  Mr. Archer&#x27;s heart sank at the  threshold to see a man lying perhaps mortally hurt in so poor  a sick-room, and as he drew near the low bed he took his hat  off.  The guard was a big, blowsy, innocent-looking soul with  a thick lip and a broad nose, comically turned up; his cheeks  were crimson, and when Mr. Archer laid a finger on his brow  he found him burning with fever.</p>
<p>&#x27;I fear you suffer much,&#x27; he said, with a catch in his voice,  as he sat down on the bedside.</p>
<p>&#x27;I suppose I do, sir,&#x27; returned Oglethorpe; &#x27;it is main  sore.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I am used to wounds and wounded men,&#x27; returned the visitor.   &#x27;I have been in the wars and nursed brave fellows before now;  and, if you will suffer me, I propose to stay beside you till  the doctor comes.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;It is very good of you, sir, I am sure,&#x27; said Oglethorpe.   &#x27;The trouble is they won&#x27;t none of them let me drink.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;If you will not tell the doctor,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, &#x27;I will  give you some water.  They say it is bad for a green wound,  but in the Low Countries we all drank water when we found the  chance, and I could never perceive we were the worse for it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Been wounded yourself, sir, perhaps?&#x27; called Oglethorpe.</p>
<p>&#x27;Twice,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, &#x27;and was as proud of these hurts as  any lady of her bracelets.  &#x27;Tis a fine thing to smart for  one&#x27;s duty; even in the pangs of it there is contentment.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ah, well!&#x27; replied the guard, &#x27;if you&#x27;ve been shot yourself,  that explains.  But as for contentment, why, sir, you see, it  smarts, as you say.  And then, I have a good wife, you see,  and a bit of a brat - a little thing, so high.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Don&#x27;t move,&#x27; said Mr. Archer.</p>
<p>&#x27;No, sir, I will not, and thank you kindly,&#x27; said Oglethorpe.   &#x27;At York they are.  A very good lass is my wife - far too  good for me.  And the little rascal - well, I don&#x27;t know how  to say it, but he sort of comes round you.  If I were to go,  sir, it would be hard on my poor girl - main hard on her!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ay, you must feel bitter hardly to the rogue that laid you  here,&#x27; said Archer.</p>
<p>&#x27;Why, no, sir, more against Engleton and the passengers,&#x27;  replied the guard.  &#x27;He played his hand, if you come to look  at it; and I wish he had shot worse, or me better.  And yet  I&#x27;ll go to my grave but what I covered him,&#x27; he cried.  &#x27;It  looks like witchcraft.  I&#x27;ll go to my grave but what he was  drove full of slugs like a pepper-box.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Quietly,&#x27; said Mr. Archer, &#x27;you must not excite yourself.   These deceptions are very usual in war; the eye, in the  moment of alert, is hardly to be trusted, and when the smoke  blows away you see the man you fired at, taking aim, it may  be, at yourself.  You should observe, too, that you were in  the dark night, and somewhat dazzled by the lamps, and that  the sudden stopping of the mail had jolted you.  In such  circumstances a man may miss, ay, even with a blunder-buss,  and no blame attach to his marksmanship.&#x27; . . .</p>
<p>THE YOUNG CHEVALIER PROLOGUE - THE WINE-SELLER&#x27;S WIFE</p>
<p>THERE was a wine-seller&#x27;s shop, as you went down to the river  in the city of the Anti-popes.  There a man was served with  good wine of the country and plain country fare; and the  place being clean and quiet, with a prospect on the river,  certain gentlemen who dwelt in that city in attendance on a  great personage made it a practice (when they had any silver  in their purses) to come and eat there and be private.</p>
<p>They called the wine-seller Paradou.  He was built more like  a bullock than a man, huge in bone and brawn, high in colour,  and with a hand like a baby for size.  Marie-Madeleine was  the name of his wife; she was of Marseilles, a city of  entrancing women, nor was any fairer than herself.  She was  tall, being almost of a height with Paradou; full-girdled,  point-device in every form, with an exquisite delicacy in the  face; her nose and nostrils a delight to look at from the  fineness of the sculpture, her eyes inclined a hair&#x27;s-breadth  inward, her colour between dark and fair, and laid on even  like a flower&#x27;s.  A faint rose dwelt in it, as though she had  been found unawares bathing, and had blushed from head to  foot.  She was of a grave countenance, rarely smiling; yet it  seemed to be written upon every part of her that she rejoiced  in life.  Her husband loved the heels of her feet and the  knuckles of her fingers; he loved her like a glutton and a  brute; his love hung about her like an atmosphere; one that  came by chance into the wine-shop was aware of that passion;  and it might be said that by the strength of it the woman had  been drugged or spell-bound.  She knew not if she loved or  loathed him; he was always in her eyes like something  monstrous - monstrous in his love, monstrous in his person,  horrific but imposing in his violence; and her sentiment  swung back and forward from desire to sickness.  But the  mean, where it dwelt chiefly, was an apathetic fascination,  partly of horror; as of Europa in mid ocean with her bull.</p>
<p>On the 10th November 1749 there sat two of the foreign  gentlemen in the wine-seller&#x27;s shop.  They were both handsome  men of a good presence, richly dressed.  The first was  swarthy and long and lean, with an alert, black look, and a  mole upon his cheek.  The other was more fair.  He seemed  very easy and sedate, and a little melancholy for so young a  man, but his smile was charming.  In his grey eyes there was  much abstraction, as of one recalling fondly that which was  past and lost.  Yet there was strength and swiftness in his  limbs; and his mouth set straight across his face, the under  lip a thought upon side, like that of a man accustomed to  resolve.  These two talked together in a rude outlandish  speech that no frequenter of that wine-shop understood.  The  swarthy man answered to the name of BALLANTRAE; he of the  dreamy eyes was sometimes called BALMILE, and sometimes MY  LORD, or MY LORD GLADSMUIR; but when the title was given him,  he seemed to put it by as if in jesting, not without  bitterness.</p>
<p>The mistral blew in the city.  The first day of that wind,  they say in the countries where its voice is heard, it blows  away all the dust, the second all the stones, and the third  it blows back others from the mountains.  It was now come to  the third day; outside the pebbles flew like hail, and the  face of the river was puckered, and the very building-stones  in the walls of houses seemed to be curdled with the savage  cold and fury of that continuous blast.  It could be heard to  hoot in all the chimneys of the city; it swept about the  wine-shop, filling the room with eddies; the chill and gritty  touch of it passed between the nearest clothes and the bare  flesh; and the two gentlemen at the far table kept their  mantles loose about their shoulders.  The roughness of these  outer hulls, for they were plain travellers&#x27; cloaks that had  seen service, set the greater mark of richness on what showed  below of their laced clothes; for the one was in scarlet and  the other in violet and white, like men come from a scene of  ceremony; as indeed they were.</p>
<p>It chanced that these fine clothes were not without their  influence on the scene which followed, and which makes the  prologue of our tale.  For a long time Balmile was in the  habit to come to the wine-shop and eat a meal or drink a  measure of wine; sometimes with a comrade; more often alone,  when he would sit and dream and drum upon the table, and the  thoughts would show in the man&#x27;s face in little glooms and  lightenings, like the sun and the clouds upon a water.  For a  long time Marie-Madeleine had observed him apart.  His  sadness, the beauty of his smile when by any chance he  remembered her existence and addressed her, the changes of  his mind signalled forth by an abstruse play of feature, the  mere fact that he was foreign and a thing detached from the  local and the accustomed, insensibly attracted and affected  her.  Kindness was ready in her mind; it but lacked the touch  of an occasion to effervesce and crystallise.  Now Balmile  had come hitherto in a very poor plain habit; and this day of  the mistral, when his mantle was just open, and she saw  beneath it the glancing of the violet and the velvet and the  silver, and the clustering fineness of the lace, it seemed to  set the man in a new light, with which he shone resplendent  to her fancy.</p>
<p>The high inhuman note of the wind, the violence and  continuity of its outpouring, and the fierce touch of it upon  man&#x27;s whole periphery, accelerated the functions of the mind.   It set thoughts whirling, as it whirled the trees of the  forest; it stirred them up in flights, as it stirred up the  dust in chambers.  As brief as sparks, the fancies glittered  and succeeded each other in the mind of Marie-Madeleine; and  the grave man with the smile, and the bright clothes under  the plain mantle, haunted her with incongruous explanations.   She considered him, the unknown, the speaker of an unknown  tongue, the hero (as she placed him) of an unknown romance,  the dweller upon unknown memories.  She recalled him sitting  there alone, so immersed, so stupefied; yet she was sure he  was not stupid.  She recalled one day when he had remained a  long time motionless, with parted lips, like one in the act  of starting up, his eyes fixed on vacancy.  Any one else must  have looked foolish; but not he.  She tried to conceive what  manner of memory had thus entranced him; she forged for him a  past; she showed him to herself in every light of heroism and  greatness and misfortune; she brooded with petulant intensity  on all she knew and guessed of him.  Yet, though she was  already gone so deep, she was still unashamed, still  unalarmed; her thoughts were still disinterested; she had  still to reach the stage at which - beside the image of that  other whom we love to contemplate and to adorn - we place the  image of ourself and behold them together with delight.</p>
<p>She stood within the counter, her hands clasped behind her  back, her shoulders pressed against the wall, her feet braced  out.  Her face was bright with the wind and her own thoughts;  as a fire in a similar day of tempest glows and brightens on  a hearth, so she seemed to glow, standing there, and to  breathe out energy.  It was the first time Ballantrae had  visited that wine-seller&#x27;s, the first time he had seen the  wife; and his eyes were true to her.</p>
<p>&#x27;I perceive your reason for carrying me to this very draughty  tavern,&#x27; he said at last.</p>
<p>&#x27;I believe it is propinquity,&#x27; returned Balmile.</p>
<p>&#x27;You play dark,&#x27; said Ballantrae, &#x27;but have a care!  Be more  frank with me, or I will cut you out.  I go through no form  of qualifying my threat, which would be commonplace and not  conscientious.  There is only one point in these campaigns:  that is the degree of admiration offered by the man; and to  our hostess I am in a posture to make victorious love.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;If you think you have the time, or the game worth the  candle,&#x27; replied the other with a shrug.</p>
<p>&#x27;One would suppose you were never at the pains to observe  her,&#x27; said Ballantrae.</p>
<p>&#x27;I am not very observant,&#x27; said Balmile.  &#x27;She seems comely.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;You very dear and dull dog!&#x27; cried Ballantrae; &#x27;chastity is  the most besotting of the virtues.  Why, she has a look in  her face beyond singing!  I believe, if you was to push me  hard, I might trace it home to a trifle of a squint.  What  matters?  The height of beauty is in the touch that&#x27;s wrong,  that&#x27;s the modulation in a tune.  &#x27;Tis the devil we all love;  I owe many a conquest to my mole&#x27; - he touched it as he spoke  with a smile, and his eyes glittered; - &#x27;we are all  hunchbacks, and beauty is only that kind of deformity that I  happen to admire.  But come!  Because you are chaste, for  which I am sure I pay you my respects, that is no reason why  you should be blind.  Look at her, look at the delicious nose  of her, look at her cheek, look at her ear, look at her hand  and wrist - look at the whole baggage from heels to crown,  and tell me if she wouldn&#x27;t melt on a man&#x27;s tongue.&#x27;</p>
<p>As Ballantrae spoke, half jesting, half enthusiastic, Balmile  was constrained to do as he was bidden.  He looked at the  woman, admired her excellences, and was at the same time  ashamed for himself and his companion.  So it befell that  when Marie-Madeleine raised her eyes, she met those of the  subject of her contemplations fixed directly on herself with  a look that is unmistakable, the look of a person measuring  and valuing another - and, to clench the false impression,  that his glance was instantly and guiltily withdrawn.  The  blood beat back upon her heart and leaped again; her obscure  thoughts flashed clear before her; she flew in fancy straight  to his arms like a wanton, and fled again on the instant like  a nymph.  And at that moment there chanced an interruption,  which not only spared her embarrassment, but set the last  consecration on her now articulate love.</p>
<p>Into the wine-shop there came a French gentleman, arrayed in  the last refinement of the fashion, though a little tumbled  by his passage in the wind.  It was to be judged he had come  from the same formal gathering at which the others had  preceded him; and perhaps that he had gone there in the hope  to meet with them, for he came up to Ballantrae with  unceremonious eagerness.</p>
<p>&#x27;At last, here you are!&#x27; he cried in French.  &#x27;I thought I  was to miss you altogether.&#x27;</p>
<p>The Scotsmen rose, and Ballantrae, after the first greetings,  laid his hand on his companion&#x27;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#x27;My lord,&#x27; said he, &#x27;allow me to present to you one of my  best friends and one of our best soldiers, the Lord Viscount  Gladsmuir.&#x27;</p>
<p>The two bowed with the elaborate elegance of the period.</p>
<p>&#x27;MONSEIGNEUR,&#x27; said Balmile, &#x27;JE N&#x27;AI PAS LA PRETENTION DE  M&#x27;AFFUBLER D&#x27;UN TITRE QUE LA MAUVAISE FORTUNE DE MON ROI NE  ME PERMET PAS DE PORTER COMMA IL SIED.  JE M&#x27;APPELLE, POUR  VOUS SERVIR, BLAIR DE BALMILE TOUT COURT.&#x27;  [My lord, I have  not the effrontery to cumber myself with a title which the  ill fortunes of my king will not suffer me to bear the way it  should be.  I call myself, at your service, plain Blair of  Balmile.]</p>
<p>&#x27;MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE OU MONSIEUR BLER&#x27; DE BALMAIL,&#x27; replied  the newcomer, &#x27;LE NOM N&#x27;Y FAIT RIEN, ET L&#x27;ON CONNAIT VOS  BEAUX FAITS.&#x27;  [The name matters nothing, your gallant  actions are known.]</p>
<p>A few more ceremonies, and these three, sitting down together  to the table, called for wine.  It was the happiness of  Marie-Madeleine to wait unobserved upon the prince of her  desires.  She poured the wine, he drank of it; and that link  between them seemed to her, for the moment, close as a  caress.  Though they lowered their tones, she surprised great  names passing in their conversation, names of kings, the  names of de Gesvre and Belle-Isle; and the man who dealt in  these high matters, and she who was now coupled with him in  her own thoughts, seemed to swim in mid air in a  transfiguration.  Love is a crude core, but it has singular  and far-reaching fringes; in that passionate attraction for  the stranger that now swayed and mastered her, his harsh  incomprehensible language, and these names of grandees in his  talk, were each an element.</p>
<p>The Frenchman stayed not long, but it was plain he left  behind him matter of much interest to his companions; they  spoke together earnestly, their heads down, the woman of the  wine-shop totally forgotten; and they were still so occupied  when Paradou returned.</p>
<p>This man&#x27;s love was unsleeping.  The even bluster of the  mistral, with which he had been combating some hours, had not  suspended, though it had embittered, that predominant  passion.  His first look was for his wife, a look of hope and  suspicion, menace and humility and love, that made the over- blooming brute appear for the moment almost beautiful.  She  returned his glance, at first as though she knew him not,  then with a swiftly waxing coldness of intent; and at last,  without changing their direction, she had closed her eyes.</p>
<p>There passed across her mind during that period much that  Paradou could not have understood had it been told to him in  words: chiefly the sense of an enlightening contrast betwixt  the man who talked of kings and the man who kept a wine-shop,  betwixt the love she yearned for and that to which she had  been long exposed like a victim bound upon the altar.  There  swelled upon her, swifter than the Rhone, a tide of  abhorrence and disgust.  She had succumbed to the monster,  humbling herself below animals; and now she loved a hero,  aspiring to the semi-divine.  It was in the pang of that  humiliating thought that she had closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Paradou - quick as beasts are quick, to translate silence -  felt the insult through his blood; his inarticulate soul  bellowed within him for revenge.  He glanced about the shop.   He saw the two indifferent gentlemen deep in talk, and passed  them over: his fancy flying not so high.  There was but one  other present, a country lout who stood swallowing his wine,  equally unobserved by all and unobserving - to him he dealt a  glance of murderous suspicion, and turned direct upon his  wife.  The wine-shop had lain hitherto, a space of shelter,  the scene of a few ceremonial passages and some whispered  conversation, in the howling river of the wind; the clock had  not yet ticked a score of times since Paradou&#x27;s appearance;  and now, as he suddenly gave tongue, it seemed as though the  mistral had entered at his heels.</p>
<p>&#x27;What ails you, woman?&#x27; he cried, smiting on the counter.</p>
<p>&#x27;Nothing ails me,&#x27; she replied.  It was strange; but she  spoke and stood at that moment like a lady of degree, drawn  upward by her aspirations.</p>
<p>&#x27;You speak to me, by God, as though you scorned me!&#x27; cried  the husband.</p>
<p>The man&#x27;s passion was always formidable; she had often looked  on upon its violence with a thrill, it had been one  ingredient in her fascination; and she was now surprised to  behold him, as from afar off, gesticulating but impotent.   His fury might be dangerous like a torrent or a gust of wind,  but it was inhuman; it might be feared or braved, it should  never be respected.  And with that there came in her a sudden  glow of courage and that readiness to die which attends so  closely upon all strong passions.</p>
<p>&#x27;I do scorn you,&#x27; she said.</p>
<p>&#x27;What is that?&#x27; he cried.</p>
<p>&#x27;I scorn you,&#x27; she repeated, smiling.</p>
<p>&#x27;You love another man!&#x27; said he.</p>
<p>&#x27;With all my soul,&#x27; was her reply.</p>
<p>The wine-seller roared aloud so that the house rang and shook  with it.</p>
<p>&#x27;Is this the - ?&#x27; he cried, using a foul word, common in the  South; and he seized the young countryman and dashed him to  the ground.  There he lay for the least interval of time  insensible; thence fled from the house, the most terrified  person in the county.  The heavy measure had escaped from his  hands, splashing the wine high upon the wall.  Paradou caught  it.  &#x27;And you?&#x27; he roared to his wife, giving her the same  name in the feminine, and he aimed at her the deadly missile.   She expected it, motionless, with radiant eyes.</p>
<p>But before it sped, Paradou was met by another adversary, and  the unconscious rivals stood confronted.  It was hard to say  at that moment which appeared the more formidable.  In  Paradou, the whole muddy and truculent depths of the half-man  were stirred to frenzy; the lust of destruction raged in him;  there was not a feature in his face but it talked murder.   Balmile had dropped his cloak: he shone out at once in his  finery, and stood to his full stature; girt in mind and body  all his resources, all his temper, perfectly in command in  his face the light of battle.  Neither spoke; there was no  blow nor threat of one; it was war reduced to its last  element, the spiritual; and the huge wine-seller slowly  lowered his weapon.  Balmile was a noble, he a commoner;  Balmile exulted in an honourable cause.  Paradou already  perhaps began to be ashamed of his violence.  Of a sudden, at  least, the tortured brute turned and fled from the shop in  the footsteps of his former victim, to whose continued flight  his reappearance added wings.</p>
<p>So soon as Balmile appeared between her husband and herself,  Marie-Madeleine transferred to him her eyes.  It might be her  last moment, and she fed upon that face; reading there  inimitable courage and illimitable valour to protect.  And  when the momentary peril was gone by, and the champion turned  a little awkwardly towards her whom he had rescued, it was to  meet, and quail before, a gaze of admiration more distinct  than words.  He bowed, he stammered, his words failed him; he  who had crossed the floor a moment ago, like a young god, to  smite, returned like one discomfited; got somehow to his  place by the table, muffled himself again in his discarded  cloak, and for a last touch of the ridiculous, seeking for  anything to restore his countenance, drank of the wine before  him, deep as a porter after a heavy lift.  It was little  wonder if Ballantrae, reading the scene with malevolent eyes,  laughed out loud and brief, and drank with raised glass, &#x27;To  the champion of the Fair.&#x27;</p>
<p>Marie-Madeleine stood in her old place within the counter;  she disdained the mocking laughter; it fell on her ears, but  it did not reach her spirit.  For her, the world of living  persons was all resumed again into one pair, as in the days  of Eden; there was but the one end in life, the one hope  before her, the one thing needful, the one thing possible -  to be his.</p>
<p>THE YOUNG CHEVALIER CHAPTER I - THE PRINCE</p>
<p>THAT same night there was in the city of Avignon a young man  in distress of mind.  Now he sat, now walked in a high  apartment, full of draughts and shadows.  A single candle  made the darkness visible; and the light scarce sufficed to  show upon the wall, where they had been recently and rudely  nailed, a few miniatures and a copper medal of the young  man&#x27;s head.  The same was being sold that year in London, to  admiring thousands.  The original was fair; he had beautiful  brown eyes, a beautiful bright open face; a little feminine,  a little hard, a little weak; still full of the light of  youth, but already beginning to be vulgarised; a sordid bloom  come upon it, the lines coarsened with a touch of puffiness.   He was dressed, as for a gala, in peach-colour and silver;  his breast sparkled with stars and was bright with ribbons;  for he had held a levee in the afternoon and received a  distinguished personage incognito.  Now he sat with a bowed  head, now walked precipitately to and fro, now went and gazed  from the uncurtained window, where the wind was still  blowing, and the lights winked in the darkness.</p>
<p>The bells of Avignon rose into song as he was gazing; and the  high notes and the deep tossed and drowned, boomed suddenly  near or were suddenly swallowed up, in the current of the  mistral.  Tears sprang in the pale blue eyes; the expression  of his face was changed to that of a more active misery, it  seemed as if the voices of the bells reached, and touched and  pained him, in a waste of vacancy where even pain was  welcome.  Outside in the night they continued to sound on,  swelling and fainting; and the listener heard in his memory,  as it were their harmonies, joy-bells clashing in a northern  city, and the acclamations of a multitude, the cries of  battle, the gross voices of cannon, the stridor of an  animated life.  And then all died away, and he stood face to  face with himself in the waste of vacancy, and a horror came  upon his mind, and a faintness on his brain, such as seizes  men upon the brink of cliffs.</p>
<p>On the table, by the side of the candle, stood a tray of  glasses, a bottle, and a silver bell.  He went thither  swiftly, then his hand lowered first above the bell, then  settled on the bottle.  Slowly he filled a glass, slowly  drank it out; and, as a tide of animal warmth recomforted the  recesses of his nature, stood there smiling at himself.  He  remembered he was young; the funeral curtains rose, and he  saw his life shine and broaden and flow out majestically,  like a river sunward.  The smile still on his lips, he lit a  second candle and a third; a fire stood ready built in a  chimney, he lit that also; and the fir-cones and the gnarled  olive billets were swift to break in flame and to crackle on  the hearth, and the room brightened and enlarged about him  like his hopes.  To and fro, to and fro, he went, his hands  lightly clasped, his breath deeply and pleasurably taken.   Victory walked with him; he marched to crowns and empires  among shouting followers; glory was his dress.  And presently  again the shadows closed upon the solitary.  Under the gilt  of flame and candle-light, the stone walls of the apartment  showed down bare and cold; behind the depicted triumph loomed  up the actual failure: defeat, the long distress of the  flight, exile, despair, broken followers, mourning faces,  empty pockets, friends estranged.  The memory of his father  rose in his mind: he, too, estranged and defied; despair  sharpened into wrath.  There was one who had led armies in  the field, who had staked his life upon the family  enterprise, a man of action and experience, of the open air,  the camp, the court, the council-room; and he was to accept  direction from an old, pompous gentleman in a home in Italy,  and buzzed about by priests?  A pretty king, if he had not a  martial son to lean upon!  A king at all?</p>
<p>&#x27;There was a weaver (of all people) joined me at St. Ninians;  he was more of a man than my papa!&#x27; he thought.  &#x27;I saw him  lie doubled in his blood and a grenadier below him - and he  died for my papa!  All died for him, or risked the dying, and  I lay for him all those months in the rain and skulked in  heather like a fox; and now he writes me his advice! calls me  Carluccio - me, the man of the house, the only king in that  king&#x27;s race.&#x27;  He ground his teeth.  &#x27;The only king in  Europe!&#x27;  Who else?  Who has done and suffered except me? who  has lain and run and hidden with his faithful subjects, like  a second Bruce?  Not my accursed cousin, Louis of France, at  least, the lewd effeminate traitor!&#x27;  And filling the glass  to the brim, he drank a king&#x27;s damnation.  Ah, if he had the  power of Louis, what a king were here!</p>
<p>The minutes followed each other into the past, and still he  persevered in this debilitating cycle of emotions, still fed  the fire of his excitement with driblets of Rhine wine: a boy  at odds with life, a boy with a spark of the heroic, which he  was now burning out and drowning down in futile reverie and  solitary excess.</p>
<p>From two rooms beyond, the sudden sound of a raised voice  attracted him.</p>
<p>&#x27;By . . .</p>
<p>HEATHERCAT CHAPTER I - TRAQUAIRS OF MONTROYMONT</p>
<p>THE period of this tale is in the heat of the KILLING-TIME;  the scene laid for the most part in solitary hills and  morasses, haunted only by the so-called Mountain Wanderers,  the dragoons that came in chase of them, the women that wept  on their dead bodies, and the wild birds of the moorland that  have cried there since the beginning.  It is a land of many  rain-clouds; a land of much mute history, written there in  prehistoric symbols.  Strange green raths are to be seen  commonly in the country, above all by the kirkyards; barrows  of the dead, standing stones; beside these, the faint,  durable footprints and handmarks of the Roman; and an  antiquity older perhaps than any, and still living and active  - a complete Celtic nomenclature and a scarce-mingled Celtic  population.  These rugged and grey hills were once included  in the boundaries of the Caledonian Forest.  Merlin sat here  below his apple-tree and lamented Gwendolen; here spoke with  Kentigern; here fell into his enchanted trance.  And the  legend of his slumber seems to body forth the story of that  Celtic race, deprived for so many centuries of their  authentic speech, surviving with their ancestral inheritance  of melancholy perversity and patient, unfortunate courage.</p>
<p>The Traquairs of Montroymont (MONS ROMANUS, as the erudite  expound it) had long held their seat about the head-waters of  the Dule and in the back parts of the moorland parish of  Balweary.  For two hundred years they had enjoyed in these  upland quarters a certain decency (almost to be named  distinction) of repute; and the annals of their house, or  what is remembered of them, were obscure and bloody.  Ninian  Traquair was &#x27;cruallie slochtered&#x27; by the Crozers at the  kirk-door of Balweary, anno 1482.  Francis killed Simon  Ruthven of Drumshoreland, anno 1540; bought letters of  slayers at the widow and heir, and, by a barbarous form of  compounding, married (without tocher) Simon&#x27;s daughter  Grizzel, which is the way the Traquairs and Ruthvens came  first to an intermarriage.  About the last Traquair and  Ruthven marriage, it is the business of this book, among many  other things, to tell.</p>
<p>The Traquairs were always strong for the Covenant; for the  King also, but the Covenant first; and it began to be ill  days for Montroymont when the Bishops came in and the  dragoons at the heels of them.  Ninian (then laird) was an  anxious husband of himself and the property, as the times  required, and it may be said of him, that he lost both.  He  was heavily suspected of the Pentland Hills rebellion.  When  it came the length of Bothwell Brig, he stood his trial  before the Secret Council, and was convicted of talking with  some insurgents by the wayside, the subject of the  conversation not very clearly appearing, and of the reset and  maintenance of one Gale, a gardener man, who was seen before  Bothwell with a musket, and afterwards, for a continuance of  months, delved the garden at Montroymont.  Matters went very  ill with Ninian at the Council; some of the lords were clear  for treason; and even the boot was talked of.  But he was  spared that torture; and at last, having pretty good  friendship among great men, he came off with a fine of seven  thousand marks, that caused the estate to groan.  In this  case, as in so many others, it was the wife that made the  trouble.  She was a great keeper of conventicles; would ride  ten miles to one, and when she was fined, rejoiced greatly to  suffer for the Kirk; but it was rather her husband that  suffered.  She had their only son, Francis, baptized  privately by the hands of Mr. Kidd; there was that much the  more to pay for!  She could neither be driven nor wiled into  the parish kirk; as for taking the sacrament at the hands of  any Episcopalian curate, and tenfold more at those of Curate  Haddo, there was nothing further from her purposes; and  Montroymont had to put his hand in his pocket month by month  and year by year.  Once, indeed, the little lady was cast in  prison, and the laird, worthy, heavy, uninterested man, had  to ride up and take her place; from which he was not  discharged under nine months and a sharp fine.  It scarce  seemed she had any gratitude to him; she came out of gaol  herself, and plunged immediately deeper in conventicles,  resetting recusants, and all her old, expensive folly, only  with greater vigour and openness, because Montroymont was  safe in the Tolbooth and she had no witness to consider.   When he was liberated and came back, with his fingers singed,  in December 1680, and late in the black night, my lady was  from home.  He came into the house at his alighting, with a  riding-rod yet in his hand; and, on the servant-maid telling  him, caught her by the scruff of the neck, beat her  violently, flung her down in the passageway, and went  upstairs to his bed fasting and without a light.  It was  three in the morning when my lady returned from that  conventicle, and, hearing of the assault (because the maid  had sat up for her, weeping), went to their common chamber  with a lantern in hand and stamping with her shoes so as to  wake the dead; it was supposed, by those that heard her, from  a design to have it out with the good man at once.  The  house-servants gathered on the stair, because it was a main  interest with them to know which of these two was the better  horse; and for the space of two hours they were heard to go  at the matter, hammer and tongs.  Montroymont alleged he was  at the end of possibilities; it was no longer within his  power to pay the annual rents; she had served him basely by  keeping conventicles while he lay in prison for her sake; his  friends were weary, and there was nothing else before him but  the entire loss of the family lands, and to begin life again  by the wayside as a common beggar.  She took him up very  sharp and high: called upon him, if he were a Christian? and  which he most considered, the loss of a few dirty, miry  glebes, or of his soul?  Presently he was heard to weep, and  my lady&#x27;s voice to go on continually like a running burn,  only the words indistinguishable; whereupon it was supposed a  victory for her ladyship, and the domestics took themselves  to bed.  The next day Traquair appeared like a man who had  gone under the harrows; and his lady wife thenceforward  continued in her old course without the least deflection.</p>
<p>Thenceforward Ninian went on his way without complaint, and  suffered his wife to go on hers without remonstrance.  He  still minded his estate, of which it might be said he took  daily a fresh farewell, and counted it already lost; looking  ruefully on the acres and the graves of his fathers, on the  moorlands where the wild-fowl consorted, the low, gurgling  pool of the trout, and the high, windy place of the calling  curlews - things that were yet his for the day and would be  another&#x27;s to-morrow; coming back again, and sitting ciphering  till the dusk at his approaching ruin, which no device of  arithmetic could postpone beyond a year or two.  He was  essentially the simple ancient man, the farmer and  landholder; he would have been content to watch the seasons  come and go, and his cattle increase, until the limit of age;  he would have been content at any time to die, if he could  have left the estates undiminished to an heir-male of his  ancestors, that duty standing first in his instinctive  calendar.  And now he saw everywhere the image of the new  proprietor come to meet him, and go sowing and reaping, or  fowling for his pleasure on the red moors, or eating the very  gooseberries in the Place garden; and saw always, on the  other hand, the figure of Francis go forth, a beggar, into  the broad world.</p>
<p>It was in vain the poor gentleman sought to moderate; took  every test and took advantage of every indulgence; went and  drank with the dragoons in Balweary; attended the communion  and came regularly to the church to Curate Haddo, with his  son beside him.  The mad, raging, Presbyterian zealot of a  wife at home made all of no avail; and indeed the house must  have fallen years before if it had not been for the secret  indulgence of the curate, who had a great sympathy with the  laird, and winked hard at the doings in Montroymont.  This  curate was a man very ill reputed in the countryside, and  indeed in all Scotland.  &#x27;Infamous Haddo&#x27; is Shield&#x27;s  expression.  But Patrick Walker is more copious.  &#x27;Curate  Hall Haddo,&#x27; says he, SUB VOCE Peden, &#x27;or HELL Haddo, as he  was more justly to be called, a pokeful of old condemned  errors and the filthy vile lusts of the flesh, a published  whore-monger, a common gross drunkard, continually and  godlessly scraping and skirling on a fiddle, continually  breathing flames against the remnant of Israel.  But the Lord  put an end to his piping, and all these offences were  composed into one bloody grave.&#x27;  No doubt this was written  to excuse his slaughter; and I have never heard it claimed  for Walker that he was either a just witness or an indulgent  judge.  At least, in a merely human character, Haddo comes  off not wholly amiss in the matter of these Traquairs: not  that he showed any graces of the Christian, but had a sort of  Pagan decency, which might almost tempt one to be concerned  about his sudden, violent, and unprepared fate.</p>
<p>HEATHERCAT CHAPTER II - FRANCIE</p>
<p>FRANCIE was eleven years old, shy, secret, and rather  childish of his age, though not backward in schooling, which  had been pushed on far by a private governor, one M&#x27;Brair, a  forfeited minister harboured in that capacity at Montroymont.   The boy, already much employed in secret by his mother, was  the most apt hand conceivable to run upon a message, to carry  food to lurking fugitives, or to stand sentry on the skyline  above a conventicle.  It seemed no place on the moorlands was  so naked but what he would find cover there; and as he knew  every hag, boulder, and heather-bush in a circuit of seven  miles about Montroymont, there was scarce any spot but what  he could leave or approach it unseen.  This dexterity had won  him a reputation in that part of the country; and among the  many children employed in these dangerous affairs, he passed  under the by-name of Heathercat.</p>
<p>How much his father knew of this employment might be doubted.   He took much forethought for the boy&#x27;s future, seeing he was  like to be left so poorly, and would sometimes assist at his  lessons, sighing heavily, yawning deep, and now and again  patting Francie on the shoulder if he seemed to be doing ill,  by way of a private, kind encouragement.  But a great part of  the day was passed in aimless wanderings with his eyes  sealed, or in his cabinet sitting bemused over the  particulars of the coming bankruptcy; and the boy would be  absent a dozen times for once that his father would observe  it.</p>
<p>On 2nd of July 1682 the boy had an errand from his mother,  which must be kept private from all, the father included in  the first of them.  Crossing the braes, he hears the clatter  of a horse&#x27;s shoes, and claps down incontinent in a hag by  the wayside.  And presently he spied his father come riding  from one direction, and Curate Haddo walking from another;  and Montroymont leaning down from the saddle, and Haddo  getting on his toes (for he was a little, ruddy, bald-pated  man, more like a dwarf), they greeted kindly, and came to a  halt within two fathoms of the child.</p>
<p>&#x27;Montroymont,&#x27; the curate said, &#x27;the deil&#x27;s in &#x27;t but I&#x27;ll  have to denunciate your leddy again.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Deil&#x27;s in &#x27;t indeed!&#x27; says the laird.</p>
<p>&#x27;Man! can ye no induce her to come to the kirk?&#x27; pursues  Haddo; &#x27;or to a communion at the least of it?  For the  conventicles, let be! and the same for yon solemn fule,  M&#x27;Brair: I can blink at them.  But she&#x27;s got to come to the  kirk, Montroymont.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Dinna speak of it,&#x27; says the laird.  &#x27;I can do nothing with  her.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Couldn&#x27;t ye try the stick to her? it works wonders whiles,&#x27;  suggested Haddo.  &#x27;No?  I&#x27;m wae to hear it.  And I suppose ye  ken where you&#x27;re going?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Fine!&#x27; said Montroymont.  &#x27;Fine do I ken where: bankrup&#x27;cy  and the Bass Rock!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Praise to my bones that I never married!&#x27; cried the curate.   &#x27;Well, it&#x27;s a grievous thing to me to see an auld house dung  down that was here before Flodden Field.  But naebody can say  it was with my wish.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;No more they can, Haddo!&#x27; says the laird.  &#x27;A good friend  ye&#x27;ve been to me, first and last.  I can give you that  character with a clear conscience.&#x27;</p>
<p>Whereupon they separated, and Montroymont rode briskly down  into the Dule Valley.  But of the curate Francis was not to  be quit so easily.  He went on with his little, brisk steps  to the corner of a dyke, and stopped and whistled and waved  upon a lassie that was herding cattle there.  This Janet  M&#x27;Clour was a big lass, being taller than the curate; and  what made her look the more so, she was kilted very high.  It  seemed for a while she would not come, and Francie heard her  calling Haddo a &#x27;daft auld fule,&#x27; and saw her running and  dodging him among the whins and hags till he was fairly  blown.  But at the last he gets a bottle from his plaid-neuk  and holds it up to her; whereupon she came at once into a  composition, and the pair sat, drinking of the bottle, and  daffing and laughing together, on a mound of heather.  The  boy had scarce heard of these vanities, or he might have been  minded of a nymph and satyr, if anybody could have taken  long-leggit Janet for a nymph.  But they seemed to be huge  friends, he thought; and was the more surprised, when the  curate had taken his leave, to see the lassie fling stones  after him with screeches of laughter, and Haddo turn about  and caper, and shake his staff at her, and laugh louder than  herself.  A wonderful merry pair, they seemed; and when  Francie had crawled out of the hag, he had a great deal to  consider in his mind.  It was possible they were all fallen  in error about Mr. Haddo, he reflected - having seen him so  tender with Montroymont, and so kind and playful with the  lass Janet; and he had a temptation to go out of his road and  question her herself upon the matter.  But he had a strong  spirit of duty on him; and plodded on instead over the braes  till he came near the House of Cairngorm.  There, in a hollow  place by the burnside that was shaded by some birks, he was  aware of a barefoot boy, perhaps a matter of three years  older than himself.  The two approached with the precautions  of a pair of strange dogs, looking at each other queerly.</p>
<p>&#x27;It&#x27;s ill weather on the hills,&#x27; said the stranger, giving  the watchword.</p>
<p>&#x27;For a season,&#x27; said Francie, &#x27;but the Lord will appear.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Richt,&#x27; said the barefoot boy; &#x27;wha&#x27;re ye frae?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;The Leddy Montroymont,&#x27; says Francie.</p>
<p>&#x27;Ha&#x27;e, then!&#x27; says the stranger, and handed him a folded  paper, and they stood and looked at each other again.  &#x27;It&#x27;s  unco het,&#x27; said the boy.</p>
<p>&#x27;Dooms het,&#x27; says Francie.</p>
<p>&#x27;What do they ca&#x27; ye?&#x27; says the other.</p>
<p>&#x27;Francie,&#x27; says he.  &#x27;I&#x27;m young Montroymont.  They ca&#x27; me  Heathercat.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I&#x27;m Jock Crozer,&#x27; said the boy.  And there was another  pause, while each rolled a stone under his foot.</p>
<p>&#x27;Cast your jaiket and I&#x27;ll fecht ye for a bawbee,&#x27; cried the  elder boy with sudden violence, and dramatically throwing  back his jacket.</p>
<p>&#x27;Na, I&#x27;ve nae time the now,&#x27; said Francie, with a sharp  thrill of alarm, because Crozer was much the heavier boy.</p>
<p>&#x27;Ye&#x27;re feared.  Heathercat indeed!&#x27; said Crozer, for among  this infantile army of spies and messengers, the fame of  Crozer had gone forth and was resented by his rivals.  And  with that they separated.</p>
<p>On his way home Francie was a good deal occupied with the  recollection of this untoward incident.  The challenge had  been fairly offered and basely refused: the tale would be  carried all over the country, and the lustre of the name of  Heathercat be dimmed.  But the scene between Curate Haddo and  Janet M&#x27;Clour had also given him much to think of: and he was  still puzzling over the case of the curate, and why such ill  words were said of him, and why, if he were so merry- spirited, he should yet preach so dry, when coming over a  knowe, whom should he see but Janet, sitting with her back to  him, minding her cattle!  He was always a great child for  secret, stealthy ways, having been employed by his mother on  errands when the same was necessary; and he came behind the  lass without her hearing.</p>
<p>&#x27;Jennet,&#x27; says he.</p>
<p>&#x27;Keep me,&#x27; cries Janet, springing up.  &#x27;O, it&#x27;s you, Maister  Francie!  Save us, what a fricht ye gied me.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ay, it&#x27;s me,&#x27; said Francie.  &#x27;I&#x27;ve been thinking, Jennet; I  saw you and the curate a while back - &#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Brat!&#x27; cried Janet, and coloured up crimson; and the one  moment made as if she would have stricken him with a ragged  stick she had to chase her bestial with, and the next was  begging and praying that he would mention it to none.  It was  &#x27;naebody&#x27;s business, whatever,&#x27; she said; &#x27;it would just  start a clash in the country&#x27;; and there would be nothing  left for her but to drown herself in Dule Water.</p>
<p>&#x27;Why?&#x27; says Francie.</p>
<p>The girl looked at him and grew scarlet again.</p>
<p>&#x27;And it isna that, anyway,&#x27; continued Francie.  &#x27;It was just  that he seemed so good to ye - like our Father in heaven, I  thought; and I thought that mebbe, perhaps, we had all been  wrong about him from the first.  But I&#x27;ll have to tell Mr.  M&#x27;Brair; I&#x27;m under a kind of a bargain to him to tell him  all.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Tell it to the divil if ye like for me!&#x27; cried the lass.   &#x27;I&#x27;ve naething to be ashamed of.  Tell M&#x27;Brair to mind his  ain affairs,&#x27; she cried again: &#x27;they&#x27;ll be hot eneugh for  him, if Haddie likes!&#x27;  And so strode off, shoving her beasts  before her, and ever and again looking back and crying angry  words to the boy, where he stood mystified.</p>
<p>By the time he had got home his mind was made up that he  would say nothing to his mother.  My Lady Montroymont was in  the keeping-room, reading a godly book; she was a wonderful  frail little wife to make so much noise in the world and be  able to steer about that patient sheep her husband; her eyes  were like sloes, the fingers of her hands were like tobacco- pipe shanks, her mouth shut tight like a trap; and even when  she was the most serious, and still more when she was angry,  there hung about her face the terrifying semblance of a  smile.</p>
<p>&#x27;Have ye gotten the billet, Francie said she; and when he had  handed it over, and she had read and burned it, &#x27;Did you see  anybody?&#x27; she asked.</p>
<p>&#x27;I saw the laird,&#x27; said Francie.</p>
<p>&#x27;He didna see you, though?&#x27; asked his mother.</p>
<p>&#x27;Deil a fear,&#x27; from Francie.</p>
<p>&#x27;Francie!&#x27; she cried.  &#x27;What&#x27;s that I hear? an aith?  The  Lord forgive me, have I broughten forth a brand for the  burning, a fagot for hell-fire?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I&#x27;m very sorry, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said Francie.  &#x27;I humbly beg the  Lord&#x27;s pardon, and yours, for my wickedness.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;H&#x27;m,&#x27; grunted the lady.  &#x27;Did ye see nobody else?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;No, ma&#x27;am,&#x27; said Francie, with the face of an angel, &#x27;except  Jock Crozer, that gied me the billet.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Jock Crozer!&#x27; cried the lady.  &#x27;I&#x27;ll Crozer them!  Crozers  indeed!  What next?  Are we to repose the lives of a  suffering remnant in Crozers?  The whole clan of them wants  hanging, and if I had my way of it, they wouldna want it  long.  Are you aware, sir, that these Crozers killed your  forebear at the kirk-door?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;You see, he was bigger &#x27;n me,&#x27; said Francie.</p>
<p>&#x27;Jock Crozer!&#x27; continued the lady.  &#x27;That&#x27;ll be Clement&#x27;s  son, the biggest thief and reiver in the country-side.  To  trust a note to him!  But I&#x27;ll give the benefit of my  opinions to Lady Whitecross when we two forgather.  Let her  look to herself!  I have no patience with half-hearted  carlines, that complies on the Lord&#x27;s day morning with the  kirk, and comes taigling the same night to the conventicle.   The one or the other! is what I say: hell or heaven -  Haddie&#x27;s abominations or the pure word of God dreeping from  the lips of Mr. Arnot,</p>
<p>&#x27;&quot;Like honey from the honeycomb That dreepeth, sweeter far.&quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>My lady was now fairly launched, and that upon two congenial  subjects: the deficiencies of the Lady Whitecross and the  turpitudes of the whole Crozer race - which, indeed, had  never been conspicuous for respectability.  She pursued the  pair of them for twenty minutes on the clock with wonderful  animation and detail, something of the pulpit manner, and the  spirit of one possessed.  &#x27;O hellish compliance!&#x27; she  exclaimed.  &#x27;I would not suffer a complier to break bread  with Christian folk.  Of all the sins of this day there is  not one so God-defying, so Christ-humiliating, as damnable  compliance&#x27;: the boy standing before her meanwhile, and  brokenly pursuing other thoughts, mainly of Haddo and Janet,  and Jock Crozer stripping off his jacket.  And yet, with all  his distraction, it might be argued that he heard too much:  his father and himself being &#x27;compliers&#x27; - that is to say,  attending the church of the parish as the law required.</p>
<p>Presently, the lady&#x27;s passion beginning to decline, or her  flux of ill words to be exhausted, she dismissed her  audience.  Francie bowed low, left the room, closed the door  behind him: and then turned him about in the passage-way, and  with a low voice, but a prodigious deal of sentiment,  repeated the name of the evil one twenty times over, to the  end of which, for the greater efficacy, he tacked on  &#x27;damnable&#x27; and &#x27;hellish.&#x27;  FAS EST AB HOSTE DOCERI -  disrespect is made more pungent by quotation; and there is no  doubt but he felt relieved, and went upstairs into his  tutor&#x27;s chamber with a quiet mind.  M&#x27;Brair sat by the cheek  of the peat-fire and shivered, for he had a quartan ague and  this was his day.  The great night-cap and plaid, the dark  unshaven cheeks of the man, and the white, thin hands that  held the plaid about his chittering body, made a sorrowful  picture.  But Francie knew and loved him; came straight in,  nestled close to the refugee, and told his story.  M&#x27;Brair  had been at the College with Haddo; the Presbytery had  licensed both on the same day; and at this tale, told with so  much innocency by the boy, the heart of the tutor was  commoved.</p>
<p>&#x27;Woe upon him!  Woe upon that man!&#x27; he cried.  &#x27;O the  unfaithful shepherd!  O the hireling and apostate minister!   Make my matters hot for me? quo&#x27; she! the shameless limmer!   And true it is, that he could repose me in that nasty,  stinking hole, the Canongate Tolbooth, from which your mother  drew me out - the Lord reward her for it! - or to that cold,  unbieldy, marine place of the Bass Rock, which, with my  delicate kist, would be fair ruin to me.  But I will be  valiant in my Master&#x27;s service.  I have a duty here: a duty  to my God, to myself, and to Haddo: in His strength, I will  perform it.&#x27;</p>
<p>Then he straitly discharged Francie to repeat the tale, and  bade him in the future to avert his very eyes from the doings  of the curate.  &#x27;You must go to his place of idolatry; look  upon him there!&#x27; says he, &#x27;but nowhere else.  Avert your  eyes, close your ears, pass him by like a three days&#x27; corp.   He is like that damnable monster Basiliscus, which defiles -  yea, poisons! - by the sight.&#x27; - All which was hardly  claratory to the boy&#x27;s mind.</p>
<p>Presently Montroymont came home, and called up the stairs to  Francie.  Traquair was a good shot and swordsman: and it was  his pleasure to walk with his son over the braes of the  moorfowl, or to teach him arms in the back court, when they  made a mighty comely pair, the child being so lean, and  light, and active, and the laird himself a man of a manly,  pretty stature, his hair (the periwig being laid aside)  showing already white with many anxieties, and his face of an  even, flaccid red.  But this day Francie&#x27;s heart was not in  the fencing.</p>
<p>&#x27;Sir,&#x27; says he, suddenly lowering his point, &#x27;will ye tell me  a thing if I was to ask it?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ask away,&#x27; says the father.</p>
<p>&#x27;Well, it&#x27;s this,&#x27; said Francie: &#x27;Why do you and me comply if  it&#x27;s so wicked?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ay, ye have the cant of it too!&#x27; cries Montroymont.  &#x27;But  I&#x27;ll tell ye for all that.  It&#x27;s to try and see if we can  keep the rigging on this house, Francie.  If she had her way,  we would be beggar-folk, and hold our hands out by the  wayside.  When ye hear her - when ye hear folk,&#x27; he corrected  himself briskly, &#x27;call me a coward, and one that betrayed the  Lord, and I kenna what else, just mind it was to keep a bed  to ye to sleep in and a bite for ye to eat. - On guard!&#x27; he  cried, and the lesson proceeded again till they were called  to supper.</p>
<p>&#x27;There&#x27;s another thing yet,&#x27; said Francie, stopping his  father.  &#x27;There&#x27;s another thing that I am not sure that I am  very caring for.  She - she sends me errands.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Obey her, then, as is your bounden duty,&#x27; said Traquair.</p>
<p>&#x27;Ay, but wait till I tell ye,&#x27; says the boy.  &#x27;If I was to  see you I was to hide.&#x27;</p>
<p>Montroymont sighed.  &#x27;Well, and that&#x27;s good of her too,&#x27; said  he.  &#x27;The less that I ken of thir doings the better for me;  and the best thing you can do is just to obey her, and see  and be a good son to her, the same as ye are to me, Francie.&#x27;</p>
<p>At the tenderness of this expression the heart of Francie  swelled within his bosom, and his remorse was poured out.   &#x27;Faither!&#x27; he cried, &#x27;I said &quot;deil&quot; to-day; many&#x27;s the time I  said it, and DAMNABLE too, and HELLITSH.  I ken they&#x27;re all  right; they&#x27;re beeblical.  But I didna say them beeblically;  I said them for sweir words - that&#x27;s the truth of it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Hout, ye silly bairn!&#x27; said the father, &#x27;dinna do it nae  mair, and come in by to your supper.&#x27;  And he took the boy,  and drew him close to him a moment, as they went through the  door, with something very fond and secret, like a caress  between a pair of lovers.</p>
<p>The next day M&#x27;Brair was abroad in the afternoon, and had a  long advising with Janet on the braes where she herded  cattle.  What passed was never wholly known; but the lass  wept bitterly, and fell on her knees to him among the whins.   The same night, as soon as it was dark, he took the road  again for Balweary.  In the Kirkton, where the dragoons  quartered, he saw many lights, and heard the noise of a  ranting song and people laughing grossly, which was highly  offensive to his mind.  He gave it the wider berth, keeping  among fields; and came down at last by the water-side, where  the manse stands solitary between the river and the road.  He  tapped at the back door, and the old woman called upon him to  come in, and guided him through the house to the study, as  they still called it, though there was little enough study  there in Haddo&#x27;s days, and more song-books than theology.</p>
<p>&#x27;Here&#x27;s yin to speak wi&#x27; ye, Mr. Haddie!&#x27; cries the old wife.</p>
<p>And M&#x27;Brair, opening the door and entering, found the little,  round, red man seated in one chair and his feet upon another.   A clear fire and a tallow dip lighted him barely.  He was  taking tobacco in a pipe, and smiling to himself; and a  brandy-bottle and glass, and his fiddle and bow, were beside  him on the table.</p>
<p>&#x27;Hech, Patey M&#x27;Briar, is this you?&#x27; said he, a trifle  tipsily.  &#x27;Step in by, man, and have a drop brandy: for the  stomach&#x27;s sake!  Even the deil can quote Scripture - eh,  Patey?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;I will neither eat nor drink with you,&#x27; replied M&#x27;Brair.  &#x27;I  am come upon my Master&#x27;s errand: woe be upon me if I should  anyways mince the same.  Hall Haddo, I summon you to quit  this kirk which you encumber.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Muckle obleeged!&#x27; says Haddo, winking.</p>
<p>&#x27;You and me have been to kirk and market together,&#x27; pursued  M&#x27;Brair; &#x27;we have had blessed seasons in the kirk, we have  sat in the same teaching-rooms and read in the same book; and  I know you still retain for me some carnal kindness.  It  would be my shame if I denied it; I live here at your mercy  and by your favour, and glory to acknowledge it.  You have  pity on my wretched body, which is but grass, and must soon  be trodden under: but O, Haddo! how much greater is the  yearning with which I yearn after and pity your immortal  soul!  Come now, let us reason together!  I drop all points  of controversy, weighty though these be; I take your defaced  and damnified kirk on your own terms; and I ask you, Are you  a worthy minister?  The communion season approaches; how can  you pronounce thir solemn words, &quot;The elders will now bring  forrit the elements,&quot; and not quail?  A parishioner may be  summoned to-night; you may have to rise from your miserable  orgies; and I ask you, Haddo, what does your conscience tell  you?  Are you fit?  Are you fit to smooth the pillow of a  parting Christian?  And if the summons should be for  yourself, how then?&#x27;</p>
<p>Haddo was startled out of all composure and the better part  of his temper.  &#x27;What&#x27;s this of it?&#x27; he cried.  &#x27;I&#x27;m no waur  than my neebours.  I never set up to be speeritual; I never  did.  I&#x27;m a plain, canty creature; godliness is cheerfulness,  says I; give me my fiddle and a dram, and I wouldna hairm a  flee.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;And I repeat my question,&#x27; said M&#x27;Brair: &#x27;Are you fit - fit  for this great charge? fit to carry and save souls?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Fit?  Blethers!  As fit&#x27;s yoursel&#x27;,&#x27; cried Haddo.</p>
<p>&#x27;Are you so great a self-deceiver?&#x27; said M&#x27;Brair.  &#x27;Wretched  man, trampler upon God&#x27;s covenants, crucifier of your Lord  afresh.  I will ding you to the earth with one word: How  about the young woman, Janet M&#x27;Clour?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Weel, what about her? what do I ken?&#x27; cries Haddo.   &#x27;M&#x27;Brair, ye daft auld wife, I tell ye as true&#x27;s truth, I  never meddled her.  It was just daffing, I tell ye: daffing,  and nae mair: a piece of fun, like!  I&#x27;m no denying but what  I&#x27;m fond of fun, sma&#x27; blame to me!  But for onything sarious  - hout, man, it might come to a deposeetion!  I&#x27;ll sweir it  to ye.  Where&#x27;s a Bible, till you hear me sweir?&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;There is nae Bible in your study,&#x27; said M&#x27;Brair severely.</p>
<p>And Haddo, after a few distracted turns, was constrained to  accept the fact.</p>
<p>&#x27;Weel, and suppose there isna?&#x27; he cried, stamping.  &#x27;What  mair can ye say of us, but just that I&#x27;m fond of my joke, and  so&#x27;s she?  I declare to God, by what I ken, she might be the  Virgin Mary - if she would just keep clear of the dragoons.   But me! na, deil haet o&#x27; me!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;She is penitent at least,&#x27; says M&#x27;Brair.</p>
<p>&#x27;Do you mean to actually up and tell me to my face that she  accused me?&#x27; cried the curate.</p>
<p>&#x27;I canna just say that,&#x27; replied M&#x27;Brair.  &#x27;But I rebuked her  in the name of God, and she repented before me on her bended  knees.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Weel, I daursay she&#x27;s been ower far wi&#x27; the dragoons,&#x27; said  Haddo.  &#x27;I never denied that.  I ken naething by it.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Man, you but show your nakedness the more plainly,&#x27; said  M&#x27;Brair.  &#x27;Poor, blind, besotted creature - and I see you  stoytering on the brink of dissolution: your light out, and  your hours numbered.  Awake, man!&#x27; he shouted with a  formidable voice, &#x27;awake, or it be ower late.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Be damned if I stand this!&#x27; exclaimed Haddo, casting his  tobacco-pipe violently on the table, where it was smashed in  pieces.  &#x27;Out of my house with ye, or I&#x27;ll call for the  dragoons.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;The speerit of the Lord is upon me,&#x27; said M&#x27;Brair with  solemn ecstasy.  &#x27;I sist you to compear before the Great  White Throne, and I warn you the summons shall be bloody and  sudden.&#x27;</p>
<p>And at this, with more agility than could have been expected,  he got clear of the room and slammed the door behind him in  the face of the pursuing curate.  The next Lord&#x27;s day the  curate was ill, and the kirk closed, but for all his ill  words, Mr. M&#x27;Brair abode unmolested in the house of  Montroymont.</p>
<p>HEATHERCAT CHAPTER III - THE HILL-END OF DRUMLOWE</p>
<p>THIS was a bit of a steep broken hill that overlooked upon  the west a moorish valley, full of ink-black pools.  These  presently drained into a burn that made off, with little  noise and no celerity of pace, about the corner of the hill.   On the far side the ground swelled into a bare heath, black  with junipers, and spotted with the presence of the standing  stones for which the place was famous.  They were many in  that part, shapeless, white with lichen - you would have said  with age: and had made their abode there for untold  centuries, since first the heathens shouted for their  installation.  The ancients had hallowed them to some ill  religion, and their neighbourhood had long been avoided by  the prudent before the fall of day; but of late, on the  upspringing of new requirements, these lonely stones on the  moor had again become a place of assembly.  A watchful picket  on the Hill-end commanded all the northern and eastern  approaches; and such was the disposition of the ground, that  by certain cunningly posted sentries the west also could be  made secure against surprise: there was no place in the  country where a conventicle could meet with more quiet of  mind or a more certain retreat open, in the case of  interference from the dragoons.  The minister spoke from a  knowe close to the edge of the ring, and poured out the words  God gave him on the very threshold of the devils of yore.   When they pitched a tent (which was often in wet weather,  upon a communion occasion) it was rigged over the huge  isolated pillar that had the name of Anes-Errand, none knew  why.  And the congregation sat partly clustered on the slope  below, and partly among the idolatrous monoliths and on the  turfy soil of the Ring itself.  In truth the situation was  well qualified to give a zest to Christian doctrines, had  there been any wanted.  But these congregations assembled  under conditions at once so formidable and romantic as made a  zealot of the most cold.  They were the last of the faithful;  God, who had averted His face from all other countries of the  world, still leaned from heaven to observe, with swelling  sympathy, the doings of His moorland remnant; Christ was by  them with His eternal wounds, with dropping tears; the Holy  Ghost (never perfectly realised nor firmly adopted by  Protestant imaginations) was dimly supposed to be in the  heart of each and on the lips of the minister.  And over  against them was the army of the hierarchies, from the men  Charles and James Stuart, on to King Lewie and the Emperor;  and the scarlet Pope, and the muckle black devil himself,  peering out the red mouth of hell in an ecstasy of hate and  hope.  &#x27;One pull more!&#x27; he seemed to cry; &#x27;one pull more, and  it&#x27;s done.  There&#x27;s only Clydesdale and the Stewartry, and  the three Bailiaries of Ayr, left for God.&#x27;  And with such an  august assistance of powers and principalities looking on at  the last conflict of good and evil, it was scarce possible to  spare a thought to those old, infirm, debile, AB AGENDO  devils whose holy place they were now violating.</p>
<p>There might have been three hundred to four hundred present.   At least there were three hundred horses tethered for the  most part in the ring; though some of the hearers on the  outskirts of the crowd stood with their bridles in their  hand, ready to mount at the first signal.  The circle of  faces was strangely characteristic; long, serious, strongly  marked, the tackle standing out in the lean brown cheeks, the  mouth set and the eyes shining with a fierce enthusiasm; the  shepherd, the labouring man, and the rarer laird, stood there  in their broad blue bonnets or laced hats, and presenting an  essential identity of type.  From time to time a long-drawn  groan of adhesion rose in this audience, and was propagated  like a wave to the outskirts, and died away among the keepers  of the horses.  It had a name; it was called &#x27;a holy groan.&#x27;</p>
<p>A squall came up; a great volley of flying mist went out  before it and whelmed the scene; the wind stormed with a  sudden fierceness that carried away the minister&#x27;s voice and  twitched his tails and made him stagger, and turned the  congregation for a moment into a mere pother of blowing  plaid-ends and prancing horses; and the rain followed and was  dashed straight into their faces.  Men and women panted aloud  in the shock of that violent shower-bath; the teeth were  bared along all the line in an involuntary grimace; plaids,  mantles, and riding-coats were proved vain, and the  worshippers felt the water stream on their naked flesh.  The  minister, reinforcing his great and shrill voice, continued  to contend against and triumph over the rising of the squall  and the dashing of the rain.</p>
<p>&#x27;In that day ye may go thirty mile and not hear a crawing  cock,&#x27; he said; &#x27;and fifty mile and not get a light to your  pipe; and an hundred mile and not see a smoking house.  For  there&#x27;ll be naething in all Scotland but deid men&#x27;s banes and  blackness, and the living anger of the Lord.  O, where to  find a bield - O sirs, where to find a bield from the wind of  the Lord&#x27;s anger?  Do ye call THIS a wind?  Bethankit!  Sirs,  this is but a temporary dispensation; this is but a puff of  wind, this is but a spit of rain and by with it.  Already  there&#x27;s a blue bow in the west, and the sun will take the  crown of the causeway again, and your things&#x27;ll be dried upon  ye, and your flesh will be warm upon your bones.  But O,  sirs, sirs! for the day of the Lord&#x27;s anger!&#x27;</p>
<p>His rhetoric was set forth with an ear-piercing elocution,  and a voice that sometimes crashed like cannon.  Such as it  was, it was the gift of all hill-preachers, to a singular  degree of likeness or identity.  Their images scarce ranged  beyond the red horizon of the moor and the rainy hill-top,  the shepherd and his sheep, a fowling-piece, a spade, a pipe,  a dunghill, a crowing cock, the shining and the withdrawal of  the sun.  An occasional pathos of simple humanity, and  frequent patches of big Biblical words, relieved the homely  tissue.  It was a poetry apart; bleak, austere, but genuine,  and redolent of the soil.</p>
<p>A little before the coming of the squall there was a  different scene enacting at the outposts.  For the most part,  the sentinels were faithful to their important duty; the  Hill-end of Drumlowe was known to be a safe meeting-place;  and the out-pickets on this particular day had been somewhat  lax from the beginning, and grew laxer during the inordinate  length of the discourse.  Francie lay there in his appointed  hiding-hole, looking abroad between two whin-bushes.  His  view was across the course of the burn, then over a piece of  plain moorland, to a gap between two hills; nothing moved but  grouse, and some cattle who slowly traversed his field of  view, heading northward: he heard the psalms, and sang words  of his own to the savage and melancholy music; for he had his  own design in hand, and terror and cowardice prevailed in his  bosom alternately, like the hot and the cold fit of an ague.   Courage was uppermost during the singing, which he  accompanied through all its length with this impromptu  strain:</p>
<p>&#x27;And I will ding Jock Crozer down No later than the day.&#x27;</p>
<p>Presently the voice of the preacher came to him in wafts, at  the wind&#x27;s will, as by the opening and shutting of a door;  wild spasms of screaming, as of some undiscerned gigantic  hill-bird stirred with inordinate passion, succeeded to  intervals of silence; and Francie heard them with a critical  ear.  &#x27;Ay,&#x27; he thought at last, &#x27;he&#x27;ll do; he has the bit in  his mou&#x27; fairly.&#x27;</p>
<p>He had observed that his friend, or rather his enemy, Jock  Crozer, had been established at a very critical part of the  line of outposts; namely, where the burn issues by an abrupt  gorge from the semicircle of high moors.  If anything was  calculated to nerve him to battle it was this.  The post was  important; next to the Hill-end itself, it might be called  the key to the position; and it was where the cover was bad,  and in which it was most natural to place a child.  It should  have been Heathercat&#x27;s; why had it been given to Crozer?  An  exquisite fear of what should be the answer passed through  his marrow every time he faced the question.  Was it possible  that Crozer could have boasted? that there were rumours  abroad to his - Heathercat&#x27;s - discredit? that his honour was  publicly sullied?  All the world went dark about him at the  thought; he sank without a struggle into the midnight pool of  despair; and every time he so sank, he brought back with him  - not drowned heroism indeed, but half-drowned courage by the  locks.  His heart beat very slowly as he deserted his  station, and began to crawl towards that of Crozer.   Something pulled him back, and it was not the sense of duty,  but a remembrance of Crozer&#x27;s build and hateful readiness of  fist.  Duty, as he conceived it, pointed him forward on the  rueful path that he was travelling.  Duty bade him redeem his  name if he were able, at the risk of broken bones; and his  bones and every tooth in his head ached by anticipation.  An  awful subsidiary fear whispered him that if he were hurt, he  should disgrace himself by weeping.  He consoled himself,  boy-like, with the consideration that he was not yet  committed; he could easily steal over unseen to Crozer&#x27;s  post, and he had a continuous private idea that he would very  probably steal back again.  His course took him so near the  minister that he could hear some of his words: &#x27;What news,  minister, of Claver&#x27;se?  He&#x27;s going round like a roaring  rampaging lion. . . .</p>
