<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<p>HE had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and  loved them still less when they made a pretence of a figure.   Celebrations and suppressions were equally painful to him, and but  one of the former found a place in his life.  He had kept each year  in his own fashion the date of Mary Antrim&#x27;s death.  It would be  more to the point perhaps to say that this occasion kept HIM:  it  kept him at least effectually from doing anything else.  It took  hold of him again and again with a hand of which time had softened  but never loosened the touch.  He waked to his feast of memory as  consciously as he would have waked to his marriage-morn.  Marriage  had had of old but too little to say to the matter:  for the girl  who was to have been his bride there had been no bridal embrace.   She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding-day had been  fixed, and he had lost before fairly tasting it an affection that  promised to fill his life to the brim.</p>
<p>Of that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this  life could really be emptied:  it was still ruled by a pale ghost,  still ordered by a sovereign presence.  He had not been a man of  numerous passions, and even in all these years no sense had grown  stronger with him than the sense of being bereft.  He had needed no  priest and no altar to make him for ever widowed.  He had done many  things in the world - he had done almost all but one:  he had  never, never forgotten.  He had tried to put into his existence  whatever else might take up room in it, but had failed to make it  more than a house of which the mistress was eternally absent.  She  was most absent of all on the recurrent December day that his  tenacity set apart.  He had no arranged observance of it, but his  nerves made it all their own.  They drove him forth without mercy,  and the goal of his pilgrimage was far.  She had been buried in a  London suburb, a part then of Nature&#x27;s breast, but which he had  seen lose one after another every feature of freshness.  It was in  truth during the moments he stood there that his eyes beheld the  place least.  They looked at another image, they opened to another  light.  Was it a credible future?  Was it an incredible past?   Whatever the answer it was an immense escape from the actual.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s true that if there weren&#x27;t other dates than this there were  other memories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such  memories had greatly multiplied.  There were other ghosts in his  life than the ghost of Mary Antrim.  He had perhaps not had more  losses than most men, but he had counted his losses more; he hadn&#x27;t  seen death more closely, but had in a manner felt it more deeply.   He had formed little by little the habit of numbering his Dead:  it  had come to him early in life that there was something one had to  do for them.  They were there in their simplified intensified  essence, their conscious absence and expressive patience, as  personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb.  When all  sense of them failed, all sound of them ceased, it was as if their  purgatory were really still on earth:  they asked so little that  they got, poor things, even less, and died again, died every day,  of the hard usage of life.  They had no organised service, no  reserved place, no honour, no shelter, no safety.  Even ungenerous  people provided for the living, but even those who were called most  generous did nothing for the others.  So on George Stransom&#x27;s part  had grown up with the years a resolve that he at least would do  something, do it, that is, for his own - would perform the great  charity without reproach.  Every man HAD his own, and every man  had, to meet this charity, the ample resources of the soul.</p>
<p>It was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best;  as the years at any rate went by he found himself in regular  communion with these postponed pensioners, those whom indeed he  always called in his thoughts the Others.  He spared them the  moments, he organised the charity.  Quite how it had risen he  probably never could have told you, but what came to pass was that  an altar, such as was after all within everybody&#x27;s compass, lighted  with perpetual candles and dedicated to these secret rites, reared  itself in his spiritual spaces.  He had wondered of old, in some  embarrassment, whether he had a religion; being very sure, and not  a little content, that he hadn&#x27;t at all events the religion some of  the people he had known wanted him to have.  Gradually this  question was straightened out for him:  it became clear to him that  the religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had been  simply the religion of the Dead.  It suited his inclination, it  satisfied his spirit, it gave employment to his piety.  It answered  his love of great offices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no  shrine could be more bedecked and no ceremonial more stately than  those to which his worship was attached.  He had no imagination  about these things but that they were accessible to any one who  should feel the need of them.  The poorest could build such temples  of the spirit - could make them blaze with candles and smoke with  incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers.  The cost, in  the common phrase, of keeping them up fell wholly on the generous  heart.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<p>HE had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as happened, an  emotion not unconnected with that range of feeling.  Walking home  at the close of a busy day he was arrested in the London street by  the particular effect of a shop-front that lighted the dull brown  air with its mercenary grin and before which several persons were  gathered.  It was the window of a jeweller whose diamonds and  sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like high notes of sound,  with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were &quot;worth&quot; than  most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other side  of the pane.  Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a  vision, a string of pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and  then was kept an instant longer by the sound of a voice he knew.   Next him was a mumbling old woman, and beyond the old woman a  gentleman with a lady on his arm.  It was from him, from Paul  Creston, the voice had proceeded:  he was talking with the lady of  some precious object in the window.  Stransom had no sooner  recognised him than the old woman turned away; but just with this  growth of opportunity came a felt strangeness that stayed him in  the very act of laying his hand on his friend&#x27;s arm.  It lasted but  the instant, only that space sufficed for the flash of a wild  question.  Was NOT Mrs. Creston dead? - the ambiguity met him there  in the short drop of her husband&#x27;s voice, the drop conjugal, if it  ever was, and in the way the two figures leaned to each other.   Creston, making a step to look at something else, came nearer,  glanced at him, started and exclaimed - behaviour the effect of  which was at first only to leave Stransom staring, staring back  across the months at the different face, the wholly other face, the  poor man had shown him last, the blurred ravaged mask bent over the  open grave by which they had stood together.  That son of  affliction wasn&#x27;t in mourning now; he detached his arm from his  companion&#x27;s to grasp the hand of the older friend.  He coloured as  well as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised  a tentative hat to the lady.  Stransom had just time to see she was  pretty before he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous.   &quot;My dear fellow, let me make you acquainted with my wife.&quot;</p>
<p>Creston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at  the rate we live in polite society, it had practically become, for  our friend, the mere memory of a shock.  They stood there and  laughed and talked; Stransom had instantly whisked the shock out of  the way, to keep it for private consumption.  He felt himself  grimace, he heard himself exaggerate the proper, but was conscious  of turning not a little faint.  That new woman, that hired  performer, Mrs. Creston?  Mrs. Creston had been more living for him  than any woman but one.  This lady had a face that shone as  publicly as the jeweller&#x27;s window, and in the happy candour with  which she wore her monstrous character was an effect of gross  immodesty.  The character of Paul Creston&#x27;s wife thus attributed to  her was monstrous for reasons Stransom could judge his friend to  know perfectly that he knew.  The happy pair had just arrived from  America, and Stransom hadn&#x27;t needed to be told this to guess the  nationality of the lady.  Somehow it deepened the foolish air that  her husband&#x27;s confused cordiality was unable to conceal.  Stransom  recalled that he had heard of poor Creston&#x27;s having, while his  bereavement was still fresh, crossed the sea for what people in  such predicaments call a little change.  He had found the little  change indeed, he had brought the little change back; it was the  little change that stood there and that, do what he would, he  couldn&#x27;t, while he showed those high front teeth of his, look other  than a conscious ass about.  They were going into the shop, Mrs.  Creston said, and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and  help to decide.  He thanked her, opening his watch and pleading an  engagement for which he was already late, and they parted while she  shrieked into the fog, &quot;Mind now you come to see me right away!&quot;   Creston had had the delicacy not to suggest that, and Stransom  hoped it hurt him somewhere to hear her scream it to all the  echoes.</p>
<p>He felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to  go near her.  She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn&#x27;t  to have shown her without precautions, oughtn&#x27;t indeed to have  shown her at all.  His precautions should have been those of a  forger or a murderer, and the people at home would never have  mentioned extradition.  This was a wife for foreign service or  purely external use; a decent consideration would have spared her  the injury of comparisons.  Such was the first flush of George  Stransom&#x27;s reaction; but as he sat alone that night - there were  particular hours he always passed alone - the harshness dropped  from it and left only the pity.  HE could spend an evening with  Kate Creston, if the man to whom she had given everything couldn&#x27;t.   He had known her twenty years, and she was the only woman for whom  he might perhaps have been unfaithful.  She was all cleverness and  sympathy and charm; her house had been the very easiest in all the  world and her friendship the very firmest.  Without accidents he  had loved her, without accidents every one had loved her:  she had  made the passions about her as regular as the moon makes the tides.   She had been also of course far too good for her husband, but he  never suspected it, and in nothing had she been more admirable than  in the exquisite art with which she tried to keep every one else  (keeping Creston was no trouble) from finding it out.  Here was a  man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom she had given it  up - dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and she had  had only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on  her grave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had  replaced.  The frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom&#x27;s eyes  fill; and he had that evening a sturdy sense that he alone, in a  world without delicacy, had a right to hold up his head.  While he  smoked, after dinner, he had a book in his lap, but he had no eyes  for his page:  his eyes, in the swarming void of things, seemed to  have caught Kate Creston&#x27;s, and it was into their sad silences he  looked.  It was to him her sentient spirit had turned, knowing it  to be of her he would think.  He thought for a long time of how the  closed eyes of dead women could still live - how they could open  again, in a quiet lamplit room, long after they had looked their  last.  They had looks that survived - had them as great poets had  quoted lines.</p>
<p>The newspaper lay by his chair - the thing that came in the  afternoon and the servants thought one wanted; without sense for  what was in it he had mechanically unfolded and then dropped it.   Before he went to bed he took it up, and this time, at the top of a  paragraph, he was caught by five words that made him start.  He  stood staring, before the fire, at the &quot;Death of Sir Acton Hague,  K.C.B.,&quot; the man who ten years earlier had been the nearest of his  friends and whose deposition from this eminence had practically  left it without an occupant.  He had seen him after their rupture,  but hadn&#x27;t now seen him for years.  Standing there before the fire  he turned cold as he read what had befallen him.  Promoted a short  time previous to the governorship of the Westward Islands, Acton  Hague had died, in the bleak honour of this exile, of an illness  consequent on the bite of a poisonous snake.  His career was  compressed by the newspaper into a dozen lines, the perusal of  which excited on George Stransom&#x27;s part no warmer feeling than one  of relief at the absence of any mention of their quarrel, an  incident accidentally tainted at the time, thanks to their joint  immersion in large affairs, with a horrible publicity.  Public  indeed was the wrong Stransom had, to his own sense, suffered, the  insult he had blankly taken from the only man with whom he had ever  been intimate; the friend, almost adored, of his University years,  the subject, later, of his passionate loyalty:  so public that he  had never spoken of it to a human creature, so public that he had  completely overlooked it.  It had made the difference for him that  friendship too was all over, but it had only made just that one.   The shock of interests had been private, intensely so; but the  action taken by Hague had been in the face of men.  To-day it all  seemed to have occurred merely to the end that George Stransom  should think of him as &quot;Hague&quot; and measure exactly how much he  himself could resemble a stone.  He went cold, suddenly and  horribly cold, to bed.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<p>THE next day, in the afternoon, in the great grey suburb, he knew  his long walk had tired him.  In the dreadful cemetery alone he had  been on his feet an hour.  Instinctively, coming back, they had  taken him a devious course, and it was a desert in which no  circling cabman hovered over possible prey.  He paused on a corner  and measured the dreariness; then he made out through the gathered  dusk that he was in one of those tracts of London which are less  gloomy by night than by day, because, in the former case of the  civil gift of light.  By day there was nothing, but by night there  were lamps, and George Stransom was in a mood that made lamps good  in themselves.  It wasn&#x27;t that they could show him anything, it was  only that they could burn clear.  To his surprise, however, after a  while, they did show him something:  the arch of a high doorway  approached by a low terrace of steps, in the depth of which - it  formed a dim vestibule - the raising of a curtain at the moment he  passed gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of  tapers at the end.  He stopped and looked up, recognising the place  as a church.  The thought quickly came to him that since he was  tired he might rest there; so that after a moment he had in turn  pushed up the leathern curtain and gone in.  It was a temple of the  old persuasion, and there had evidently been a function - perhaps a  service for the dead; the high altar was still a blaze of candles.   This was an exhibition he always liked, and he dropped into a seat  with relief.  More than it had ever yet come home to him it struck  him as good there should be churches.</p>
<p>This one was almost empty and the other altars were dim; a verger  shuffled about, an old woman coughed, but it seemed to Stransom  there was hospitality in the thick sweet air.  Was it only the  savour of the incense or was it something of larger intention?  He  had at any rate quitted the great grey suburb and come nearer to  the warm centre.  He presently ceased to feel intrusive, gaining at  last even a sense of community with the only worshipper in his  neighbourhood, the sombre presence of a woman, in mourning  unrelieved, whose back was all he could see of her and who had sunk  deep into prayer at no great distance from him.  He wished he could  sink, like her, to the very bottom, be as motionless, as rapt in  prostration.  After a few moments he shifted his seat; it was  almost indelicate to be so aware of her.  But Stransom subsequently  quite lost himself, floating away on the sea of light.  If  occasions like this had been more frequent in his life he would  have had more present the great original type, set up in a myriad  temples, of the unapproachable shrine he had erected in his mind.   That shrine had begun in vague likeness to church pomps, but the  echo had ended by growing more distinct than the sound.  The sound  now rang out, the type blazed at him with all its fires and with a  mystery of radiance in which endless meanings could glow.  The  thing became as he sat there his appropriate altar and each starry  candle an appropriate vow.  He numbered them, named them, grouped  them - it was the silent roll-call of his Dead.  They made together  a brightness vast and intense, a brightness in which the mere  chapel of his thoughts grew so dim that as it faded away he asked  himself if he shouldn&#x27;t find his real comfort in some material act,  some outward worship.</p>
<p>This idea took possession of him while, at a distance, the black- robed lady continued prostrate; he was quietly thrilled with his  conception, which at last brought him to his feet in the sudden  excitement of a plan.  He wandered softly through the aisles,  pausing in the different chapels, all save one applied to a special  devotion.  It was in this clear recess, lampless and unapplied,  that he stood longest - the length of time it took him fully to  grasp the conception of gilding it with his bounty.  He should  snatch it from no other rites and associate it with nothing  profane; he would simply take it as it should be given up to him  and make it a masterpiece of splendour and a mountain of fire.   Tended sacredly all the year, with the sanctifying church round it,  it would always be ready for his offices.  There would be  difficulties, but from the first they presented themselves only as  difficulties surmounted.  Even for a person so little affiliated  the thing would be a matter of arrangement.  He saw it all in  advance, and how bright in especial the place would become to him  in the intermissions of toil and the dusk of afternoons; how rich  in assurance at all times, but especially in the indifferent world.   Before withdrawing he drew nearer again to the spot where he had  first sat down, and in the movement he met the lady whom he had  seen praying and who was now on her way to the door.  She passed  him quickly, and he had only a glimpse of her pale face and her  unconscious, almost sightless eyes.  For that instant she looked  faded and handsome.</p>
<p>This was the origin of the rites more public, yet certainly  esoteric, that he at last found himself able to establish.  It took  a long time, it took a year, and both the process and the result  would have been - for any who knew - a vivid picture of his good  faith.  No one did know, in fact - no one but the bland  ecclesiastics whose acquaintance he had promptly sought, whose  objections he had softly overridden, whose curiosity and sympathy  he had artfully charmed, whose assent to his eccentric munificence  he had eventually won, and who had asked for concessions in  exchange for indulgences.  Stransom had of course at an early stage  of his enquiry been referred to the Bishop, and the Bishop had been  delightfully human, the Bishop had been almost amused.  Success was  within sight, at any rate from the moment the attitude of those  whom it concerned became liberal in response to liberality.  The  altar and the sacred shell that half encircled it, consecrated to  an ostensible and customary worship, were to be splendidly  maintained; all that Stransom reserved to himself was the number of  his lights and the free enjoyment of his intention.  When the  intention had taken complete effect the enjoyment became even  greater than he had ventured to hope.  He liked to think of this  effect when far from it, liked to convince himself of it yet again  when near.  He was not often indeed so near as that a visit to it  hadn&#x27;t perforce something of the patience of a pilgrimage; but the  time he gave to his devotion came to seem to him more a  contribution to his other interests than a betrayal of them.  Even  a loaded life might be easier when one had added a new necessity to  it.</p>
<p>How much easier was probably never guessed by those who simply knew  there were hours when he disappeared and for many of whom there was  a vulgar reading of what they used to call his plunges.  These  plunges were into depths quieter than the deep sea-caves, and the  habit had at the end of a year or two become the one it would have  cost him most to relinquish.  Now they had really, his Dead,  something that was indefensibly theirs; and he liked to think that  they might in cases be the Dead of others, as well as that the Dead  of others might be invoked there under the protection of what he  had done.  Whoever bent a knee on the carpet he had laid down  appeared to him to act in the spirit of his intention.  Each of his  lights had a name for him, and from time to time a new light was  kindled.  This was what he had fundamentally agreed for, that there  should always be room for them all.  What those who passed or  lingered saw was simply the most resplendent of the altars called  suddenly into vivid usefulness, with a quiet elderly man, for whom  it evidently had a fascination, often seated there in a maze or a  doze; but half the satisfaction of the spot for this mysterious and  fitful worshipper was that he found the years of his life there,  and the ties, the affections, the struggles, the submissions, the  conquests, if there had been such, a record of that adventurous  journey in which the beginnings and the endings of human relations  are the lettered mile-stones.  He had in general little taste for  the past as a part of his own history; at other times and in other  places it mostly seemed to him pitiful to consider and impossible  to repair; but on these occasions he accepted it with something of  that positive gladness with which one adjusts one&#x27;s self to an ache  that begins to succumb to treatment.  To the treatment of time the  malady of life begins at a given moment to succumb; and these were  doubtless the hours at which that truth most came home to him.  The  day was written for him there on which he had first become  acquainted with death, and the successive phases of the  acquaintance were marked each with a flame.</p>
<p>The flames were gathering thick at present, for Stransom had  entered that dark defile of our earthly descent in which some one  dies every day.  It was only yesterday that Kate Creston had  flashed out her white fire; yet already there were younger stars  ablaze on the tips of the tapers.  Various persons in whom his  interest had not been intense drew closer to him by entering this  company.  He went over it, head by head, till he felt like the  shepherd of a huddled flock, with all a shepherd&#x27;s vision of  differences imperceptible.  He knew his candles apart, up to the  colour of the flame, and would still have known them had their  positions all been changed.  To other imaginations they might stand  for other things - that they should stand for something to be  hushed before was all he desired; but he was intensely conscious of  the personal note of each and of the distinguishable way it  contributed to the concert.  There were hours at which he almost  caught himself wishing that certain of his friends would now die,  that he might establish with them in this manner a connexion more  charming than, as it happened, it was possible to enjoy with them  in life.  In regard to those from whom one was separated by the  long curves of the globe such a connexion could only be an  improvement:  it brought them instantly within reach.  Of course  there were gaps in the constellation, for Stransom knew he could  only pretend to act for his own, and it wasn&#x27;t every figure passing  before his eyes into the great obscure that was entitled to a  memorial.  There was a strange sanctification in death, but some  characters were more sanctified by being forgotten than by being  remembered.  The greatest blank in the shining page was the memory  of Acton Hague, of which he inveterately tried to rid himself.  For  Acton Hague no flame could ever rise on any altar of his.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>EVERY year, the day he walked back from the great graveyard, he  went to church as he had done the day his idea was born.  It was on  this occasion, as it happened, after a year had passed, that he  began to observe his altar to be haunted by a worshipper at least  as frequent as himself.  Others of the faithful, and in the rest of  the church, came and went, appealing sometimes, when they  disappeared, to a vague or to a particular recognition; but this  unfailing presence was always to be observed when he arrived and  still in possession when he departed.  He was surprised, the first  time, at the promptitude with which it assumed an identity for him  - the identity of the lady whom two years before, on his  anniversary, he had seen so intensely bowed, and of whose tragic  face he had had so flitting a vision.  Given the time that had  passed, his recollection of her was fresh enough to make him  wonder.  Of himself she had of course no impression, or rather had  had none at first:  the time came when her manner of transacting  her business suggested her having gradually guessed his call to be  of the same order.  She used his altar for her own purpose - he  could only hope that sad and solitary as she always struck him, she  used it for her own Dead.  There were interruptions, infidelities,  all on his part, calls to other associations and duties; but as the  months went on he found her whenever he returned, and he ended by  taking pleasure in the thought that he had given her almost the  contentment he had given himself.  They worshipped side by side so  often that there were moments when he wished he might be sure, so  straight did their prospect stretch away of growing old together in  their rites.  She was younger than he, but she looked as if her  Dead were at least as numerous as his candles.  She had no colour,  no sound, no fault, and another of the things about which he had  made up his mind was that she had no fortune.  Always black-robed,  she must have had a succession of sorrows.  People weren&#x27;t poor,  after all, whom so many losses could overtake; they were positively  rich when they had had so much to give up.  But the air of this  devoted and indifferent woman, who always made, in any attitude, a  beautiful accidental line, conveyed somehow to Stransom that she  had known more kinds of trouble than one.</p>
<p>He had a great love of music and little time for the joy of it; but  occasionally, when workaday noises were muffled by Saturday  afternoons, it used to come back to him that there were glories.   There were moreover friends who reminded him of this and side by  side with whom he found himself sitting out concerts.  On one of  these winter afternoons, in St. James&#x27;s Hall, he became aware after  he had seated himself that the lady he had so often seen at church  was in the place next him and was evidently alone, as he also this  time happened to be.  She was at first too absorbed in the  consideration of the programme to heed him, but when she at last  glanced at him he took advantage of the movement to speak to her,  greeting her with the remark that he felt as if he already knew  her.  She smiled as she said &quot;Oh yes, I recognise you&quot;; yet in  spite of this admission of long acquaintance it was the first he  had seen of her smile.  The effect of it was suddenly to contribute  more to that acquaintance than all the previous meetings had done.   He hadn&#x27;t &quot;taken in,&quot; he said to himself, that she was so pretty.   Later, that evening - it was while he rolled along in a hansom on  his way to dine out - he added that he hadn&#x27;t taken in that she was  so interesting.  The next morning in the midst of his work he quite  suddenly and irrelevantly reflected that his impression of her,  beginning so far back, was like a winding river that had at last  reached the sea.</p>
<p>His work in fact was blurred a little all that day by the sense of  what had now passed between them.  It wasn&#x27;t much, but it had just  made the difference.  They had listened together to Beethoven and  Schumann; they had talked in the pauses, and at the end, when at  the door, to which they moved together, he had asked her if he  could help her in the matter of getting away.  She had thanked him  and put up her umbrella, slipping into the crowd without an  allusion to their meeting yet again and leaving him to remember at  leisure that not a word had been exchanged about the usual scene of  that coincidence.  This omission struck him now as natural and then  again as perverse.  She mightn&#x27;t in the least have allowed his  warrant for speaking to her, and yet if she hadn&#x27;t he would have  judged her an underbred woman.  It was odd that when nothing had  really ever brought them together he should have been able  successfully to assume they were in a manner old friends - that  this negative quantity was somehow more than they could express.   His success, it was true, had been qualified by her quick escape,  so that there grew up in him an absurd desire to put it to some  better test.  Save in so far as some other poor chance might help  him, such a test could be only to meet her afresh at church.  Left  to himself he would have gone to church the very next afternoon,  just for the curiosity of seeing if he should find her there.  But  he wasn&#x27;t left to himself, a fact he discovered quite at the last,  after he had virtually made up his mind to go.  The influence that  kept him away really revealed to him how little to himself his Dead  EVER left him.  He went only for THEM - for nothing else in the  world.</p>
<p>The force of this revulsion kept him away ten days:  he hated to  connect the place with anything but his offices or to give a  glimpse of the curiosity that had been on the point of moving him.   It was absurd to weave a tangle about a matter so simple as a  custom of devotion that might with ease have been daily or hourly;  yet the tangle got itself woven.  He was sorry, he was  disappointed:  it was as if a long happy spell had been broken and  he had lost a familiar security.  At the last, however, he asked  himself if he was to stay away for ever from the fear of this  muddle about motives.  After an interval neither longer nor shorter  than usual he re-entered the church with a clear conviction that he  should scarcely heed the presence or the absence of the lady of the  concert.  This indifference didn&#x27;t prevent his at once noting that  for the only time since he had first seen her she wasn&#x27;t on the  spot.  He had now no scruple about giving her time to arrive, but  she didn&#x27;t arrive, and when he went away still missing her he was  profanely and consentingly sorry.  If her absence made the tangle  more intricate, that was all her own doing.  By the end of another  year it was very intricate indeed; but by that time he didn&#x27;t in  the least care, and it was only his cultivated consciousness that  had given him scruples.  Three times in three months he had gone to  church without finding her, and he felt he hadn&#x27;t needed these  occasions to show him his suspense had dropped.  Yet it was,  incongruously, not indifference, but a refinement of delicacy that  had kept him from asking the sacristan, who would of course  immediately have recognised his description of her, whether she had  been seen at other hours.  His delicacy had kept him from asking  any question about her at any time, and it was exactly the same  virtue that had left him so free to be decently civil to her at the  concert.</p>
<p>This happy advantage now served him anew, enabling him when she  finally met his eyes - it was after a fourth trial - to  predetermine quite fixedly his awaiting her retreat.  He joined her  in the street as soon as she had moved, asking her if he might  accompany her a certain distance.  With her placid permission he  went as far as a house in the neighbourhood at which she had  business:  she let him know it was not where she lived.  She lived,  as she said, in a mere slum, with an old aunt, a person in  connexion with whom she spoke of the engrossment of humdrum duties  and regular occupations.  She wasn&#x27;t, the mourning niece, in her  first youth, and her vanished freshness had left something behind  that, for Stransom, represented the proof it had been tragically  sacrificed.  Whatever she gave him the assurance of she gave  without references.  She might have been a divorced duchess - she  might have been an old maid who taught the harp.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>THEY fell at last into the way of walking together almost every  time they met, though for a long time still they never met but at  church.  He couldn&#x27;t ask her to come and see him, and as if she  hadn&#x27;t a proper place to receive him she never invited her friend.   As much as himself she knew the world of London, but from an  undiscussed instinct of privacy they haunted the region not mapped  on the social chart.  On the return she always made him leave her  at the same corner.  She looked with him, as a pretext for a pause,  at the depressed things in suburban shop-fronts; and there was  never a word he had said to her that she hadn&#x27;t beautifully  understood.  For long ages he never knew her name, any more than  she had ever pronounced his own; but it was not their names that  mattered, it was only their perfect practice and their common need.</p>
<p>These things made their whole relation so impersonal that they  hadn&#x27;t the rules or reasons people found in ordinary friendships.   They didn&#x27;t care for the things it was supposed necessary to care  for in the intercourse of the world.  They ended one day - they  never knew which of them expressed it first - by throwing out the  idea that they didn&#x27;t care for each other.  Over this idea they  grew quite intimate; they rallied to it in a way that marked a  fresh start in their confidence.  If to feel deeply together about  certain things wholly distinct from themselves didn&#x27;t constitute a  safety, where was safety to be looked for?  Not lightly nor often,  not without occasion nor without emotion, any more than in any  other reference by serious people to a mystery of their faith; but  when something had happened to warm, as it were, the air for it,  they came as near as they could come to calling their Dead by name.   They felt it was coming very near to utter their thought at all.   The word &quot;they&quot; expressed enough; it limited the mention, it had a  dignity of its own, and if, in their talk, you had heard our  friends use it, you might have taken them for a pair of pagans of  old alluding decently to the domesticated gods.  They never knew -  at least Stransom never knew - how they had learned to be sure  about each other.  If it had been with each a question of what the  other was there for, the certitude had come in some fine way of its  own.  Any faith, after all, has the instinct of propagation, and it  was as natural as it was beautiful that they should have taken  pleasure on the spot in the imagination of a following.  If the  following was for each but a following of one it had proved in the  event sufficient.  Her debt, however, of course was much greater  than his, because while she had only given him a worshipper he had  given her a splendid temple.  Once she said she pitied him for the  length of his list - she had counted his candles almost as often as  himself - and this made him wonder what could have been the length  of hers.  He had wondered before at the coincidence of their  losses, especially as from time to time a new candle was set up.   On some occasion some accident led him to express this curiosity,  and she answered as if in surprise that he hadn&#x27;t already  understood.  &quot;Oh for me, you know, the more there are the better -  there could never be too many.  I should like hundreds and hundreds  - I should like thousands; I should like a great mountain of  light.&quot;</p>
<p>Then of course in a flash he understood.  &quot;Your Dead are only One?&quot;</p>
<p>She hung back at this as never yet.  &quot;Only One,&quot; she answered,  colouring as if now he knew her guarded secret.  It really made him  feel he knew less than before, so difficult was it for him to  reconstitute a life in which a single experience had so belittled  all others.  His own life, round its central hollow, had been  packed close enough.  After this she appeared to have regretted her  confession, though at the moment she spoke there had been pride in  her very embarrassment.  She declared to him that his own was the  larger, the dearer possession - the portion one would have chosen  if one had been able to choose; she assured him she could perfectly  imagine some of the echoes with which his silences were peopled.   He knew she couldn&#x27;t:  one&#x27;s relation to what one had loved and  hated had been a relation too distinct from the relations of  others.  But this didn&#x27;t affect the fact that they were growing old  together in their piety.  She was a feature of that piety, but even  at the ripe stage of acquaintance in which they occasionally  arranged to meet at a concert or to go together to an exhibition  she was not a feature of anything else.  The most that happened was  that his worship became paramount.  Friend by friend dropped away  till at last there were more emblems on his altar than houses left  him to enter.  She was more than any other the friend who remained,  but she was unknown to all the rest.  Once when she had discovered,  as they called it, a new star, she used the expression that the  chapel at last was full.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no,&quot; Stransom replied, &quot;there is a great thing wanting for  that!  The chapel will never be full till a candle is set up before  which all the others will pale.  It will be the tallest candle of  all.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mild wonder rested on him.  &quot;What candle do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, dear lady, my own.&quot;</p>
<p>He had learned after a long time that she earned money by her pen,  writing under a pseudonym she never disclosed in magazines he never  saw.  She knew too well what he couldn&#x27;t read and what she couldn&#x27;t  write, and she taught him to cultivate indifference with a success  that did much for their good relations.  Her invisible industry was  a convenience to him; it helped his contented thought of her, the  thought that rested in the dignity of her proud obscure life, her  little remunerated art and her little impenetrable home.  Lost,  with her decayed relative, in her dim suburban world, she came to  the surface for him in distant places.  She was really the  priestess of his altar, and whenever he quitted England he  committed it to her keeping.  She proved to him afresh that women  have more of the spirit of religion than men; he felt his fidelity  pale and faint in comparison with hers.  He often said to her that  since he had so little time to live he rejoiced in her having so  much; so glad was he to think she would guard the temple when he  should have been called.  He had a great plan for that, which of  course he told her too, a bequest of money to keep it up in  undiminished state.  Of the administration of this fund he would  appoint her superintendent, and if the spirit should move her she  might kindle a taper even for him.</p>
<p>&quot;And who will kindle one even for me?&quot; she then seriously asked.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<p>SHE was always in mourning, yet the day he came back from the  longest absence he had yet made her appearance immediately told him  she had lately had a bereavement.  They met on this occasion as she  was leaving the church, so that postponing his own entrance he  instantly offered to turn round and walk away with her.  She  considered, then she said:  &quot;Go in now, but come and see me in an  hour.&quot;  He knew the small vista of her street, closed at the end  and as dreary as an empty pocket, where the pairs of shabby little  houses, semi-detached but indissolubly united, were like married  couples on bad terms.  Often, however, as he had gone to the  beginning he had never gone beyond.  Her aunt was dead - that he  immediately guessed, as well as that it made a difference; but when  she had for the first time mentioned her number he found himself,  on her leaving him, not a little agitated by this sudden  liberality.  She wasn&#x27;t a person with whom, after all, one got on  so very fast:  it had taken him months and months to learn her  name, years and years to learn her address.  If she had looked, on  this reunion, so much older to him, how in the world did he look to  her?  She had reached the period of life he had long since reached,  when, after separations, the marked clock-face of the friend we  meet announces the hour we have tried to forget.  He couldn&#x27;t have  said what he expected as, at the end of his waiting, he turned the  corner where for years he had always paused; simply not to pause  was a efficient cause for emotion.  It was an event, somehow; and  in all their long acquaintance there had never been an event.  This  one grew larger when, five minutes later, in the faint elegance of  her little drawing-room, she quavered out a greeting that showed  the measure she took of it.  He had a strange sense of having come  for something in particular; strange because literally there was  nothing particular between them, nothing save that they were at one  on their great point, which had long ago become a magnificent  matter of course.  It was true that after she had said &quot;You can  always come now, you know,&quot; the thing he was there for seemed  already to have happened.  He asked her if it was the death of her  aunt that made the difference; to which she replied:  &quot;She never  knew I knew you.  I wished her not to.&quot;  The beautiful clearness of  her candour - her faded beauty was like a summer twilight -  disconnected the words from any image of deceit.  They might have  struck him as the record of a deep dissimulation; but she had  always given him a sense of noble reasons.  The vanished aunt was  present, as he looked about him, in the small complacencies of the  room, the beaded velvet and the fluted moreen; and though, as we  know, he had the worship of the Dead, he found himself not  definitely regretting this lady.  If she wasn&#x27;t in his long list,  however, she was in her niece&#x27;s short one, and Stransom presently  observed to the latter that now at least, in the place they haunted  together, she would have another object of devotion.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I shall have another.  She was very kind to me.  It&#x27;s that  that&#x27;s the difference.&quot;</p>
<p>He judged, wondering a good deal before he made any motion to leave  her, that the difference would somehow be very great and would  consist of still other things than her having let him come in.  It  rather chilled him, for they had been happy together as they were.   He extracted from her at any rate an intimation that she should now  have means less limited, that her aunt&#x27;s tiny fortune had come to  her, so that there was henceforth only one to consume what had  formerly been made to suffice for two.  This was a joy to Stransom,  because it had hitherto been equally impossible for him either to  offer her presents or contentedly to stay his hand.  It was too  ugly to be at her side that way, abounding himself and yet not able  to overflow - a demonstration that would have been signally a false  note.  Even her better situation too seemed only to draw out in a  sense the loneliness of her future.  It would merely help her to  live more and more for their small ceremonial, and this at a time  when he himself had begun wearily to feel that, having set it in  motion, he might depart.  When they had sat a while in the pale  parlour she got up - &quot;This isn&#x27;t my room:  let us go into mine.&quot;   They had only to cross the narrow hall, as he found, to pass quite  into another air.  When she had closed the door of the second room,  as she called it, he felt at last in real possession of her.  The  place had the flush of life - it was expressive; its dark red walls  were articulate with memories and relics.  These were simple things  - photographs and water-colours, scraps of writing framed and  ghosts of flowers embalmed; but a moment sufficed to show him they  had a common meaning.  It was here she had lived and worked, and  she had already told him she would make no change of scene.  He  read the reference in the objects about her - the general one to  places and times; but after a minute he distinguished among them a  small portrait of a gentleman.  At a distance and without their  glasses his eyes were only so caught by it as to feel a vague  curiosity.  Presently this impulse carried him nearer, and in  another moment he was staring at the picture in stupefaction and  with the sense that some sound had broken from him.  He was further  conscious that he showed his companion a white face when he turned  round on her gasping:  &quot;Acton Hague!&quot;</p>
<p>She matched his great wonder.  &quot;Did you know him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was the friend of all my youth - of my early manhood.  And YOU  knew him?&quot;</p>
<p>She coloured at this and for a moment her answer failed; her eyes  embraced everything in the place, and a strange irony reached her  lips as she echoed:  &quot;Knew him?&quot;</p>
<p>Then Stransom understood, while the room heaved like the cabin of a  ship, that its whole contents cried out with him, that it was a  museum in his honour, that all her later years had been addressed  to him and that the shrine he himself had reared had been  passionately converted to this use.  It was all for Acton Hague  that she had kneeled every day at his altar.  What need had there  been for a consecrated candle when he was present in the whole  array? The revelation so smote our friend in the face that he  dropped into a seat and sat silent.  He had quickly felt her shaken  by the force of his shock, but as she sank on the sofa beside him  and laid her hand on his arm he knew almost as soon that she  mightn&#x27;t resent it as much as she&#x27;d have liked.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<p>HE learned in that instant two things:  one being that even in so  long a time she had gathered no knowledge of his great intimacy and  his great quarrel; the other that in spite of this ignorance,  strangely enough, she supplied on the spot a reason for his stupor.   &quot;How extraordinary,&quot; he presently exclaimed, &quot;that we should never  have known!&quot;</p>
<p>She gave a wan smile which seemed to Stransom stranger even than  the fact itself.  &quot;I never, never spoke of him.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked again about the room.  &quot;Why then, if your life had been  so full of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mayn&#x27;t I put you that question as well?  Hadn&#x27;t your life also  been full of him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any one&#x27;s, every one&#x27;s life who had the wonderful experience of  knowing him.  I never spoke of him,&quot; Stransom added in a moment,  &quot;because he did me - years ago - an unforgettable wrong.&quot;  She was  silent, and with the full effect of his presence all about them it  almost startled her guest to hear no protest escape her.  She  accepted his words, he turned his eyes to her again to see in what  manner she accepted them.  It was with rising tears and a rare  sweetness in the movement of putting out her hand to take his own.   Nothing more wonderful had ever appeared to him than, in that  little chamber of remembrance and homage, to see her convey with  such exquisite mildness that as from Acton Hague any injury was  credible.  The clock ticked in the stillness - Hague had probably  given it to her - and while he let her hold his hand with a  tenderness that was almost an assumption of responsibility for his  old pain as well as his new, Stransom after a minute broke out:   &quot;Good God, how he must have used YOU!&quot;</p>
<p>She dropped his hand at this, got up and, moving across the room,  made straight a small picture to which, on examining it, he had  given a slight push.  Then turning round on him with her pale  gaiety recovered, &quot;I&#x27;ve forgiven him!&quot; she declared.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what you&#x27;ve done,&quot; said Stransom &quot;I know what you&#x27;ve done  for years.&quot;  For a moment they looked at each other through it all  with their long community of service in their eyes.  This short  passage made, to his sense, for the woman before him, an immense,  an absolutely naked confession; which was presently, suddenly  blushing red and changing her place again, what she appeared to  learn he perceived in it.  He got up and &quot;How you must have loved  him!&quot; he cried.</p>
<p>&quot;Women aren&#x27;t like men.  They can love even where they&#x27;ve  suffered.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Women are wonderful,&quot; said Stransom.  &quot;But I assure you I&#x27;ve  forgiven him too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I had known of anything so strange I wouldn&#x27;t have brought you  here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So that we might have gone on in our ignorance to the last?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you call the last?&quot; she asked, smiling still.</p>
<p>At this he could smile back at her.  &quot;You&#x27;ll see - when it comes.&quot;</p>
<p>She thought of that.  &quot;This is better perhaps; but as we were - it  was good.&quot;</p>
<p>He put her the question.  &quot;Did it never happen that he spoke of  me?&quot;</p>
<p>Considering more intently she made no answer, and he then knew he  should have been adequately answered by her asking how often he  himself had spoken of their terrible friend.  Suddenly a brighter  light broke in her face and an excited idea sprang to her lips in  the appeal:  &quot;You HAVE forgiven him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How, if I hadn&#x27;t, could I linger here?&quot;</p>
<p>She visibly winced at the deep but unintended irony of this; but  even while she did so she panted quickly:  &quot;Then in the lights on  your altar - ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s never a light for Acton Hague!&quot;</p>
<p>She stared with a dreadful fall, &quot;But if he&#x27;s one of your Dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s one of the world&#x27;s, if you like - he&#x27;s one of yours.  But  he&#x27;s not one of mine.  Mine are only the Dead who died possessed of  me.  They&#x27;re mine in death because they were mine in life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;HE was yours in life then, even if for a while he ceased to be.   If you forgave him you went back to him.  Those whom we&#x27;ve once  loved - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are those who can hurt us most,&quot; Stransom broke in.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah it&#x27;s not true - you&#x27;ve NOT forgiven him!&quot; she wailed with a  passion that startled him.</p>
<p>He looked at her as never yet.  &quot;What was it he did to you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everything!&quot;  Then abruptly she put out her hand in farewell.   &quot;Good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p>He turned as cold as he had turned that night he read the man&#x27;s  death.  &quot;You mean that we meet no more?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not as we&#x27;ve met - not THERE!&quot;</p>
<p>He stood aghast at this snap of their great bond, at the  renouncement that rang out in the word she so expressively sounded.   &quot;But what&#x27;s changed - for you?&quot;</p>
<p>She waited in all the sharpness of a trouble that for the first  time since he had known her made her splendidly stern.  &quot;How can  you understand now when you didn&#x27;t understand before?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t understand before only because I didn&#x27;t know.  Now that I  know, I see what I&#x27;ve been living with for years,&quot; Stransom went on  very gently.</p>
<p>She looked at him with a larger allowance, doing this gentleness  justice.  &quot;How can I then, on this new knowledge of my own, ask you  to continue to live with it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I set up my altar, with its multiplied meanings,&quot; Stransom began;  but she quietly interrupted him.</p>
<p>&quot;You set up your altar, and when I wanted one most I found it  magnificently ready.  I used it with the gratitude I&#x27;ve always  shown you, for I knew it from of old to be dedicated to Death.  I  told you long ago that my Dead weren&#x27;t many.  Yours were, but all  you had done for them was none too much for MY worship!  You had  placed a great light for Each - I gathered them together for One!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We had simply different intentions,&quot; he returned.  &quot;That, as you  say, I perfectly knew, and I don&#x27;t see why your intention shouldn&#x27;t  still sustain you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re generous - you can imagine and think.  But  the spell is broken.&quot;</p>
<p>It seemed to poor Stransom, in spite of his resistance, that it  really was, and the prospect stretched grey and void before him.   All he could say, however, was:  &quot;I hope you&#x27;ll try before you give  up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I had known you had ever known him I should have taken for  granted he had his candle,&quot; she presently answered.  &quot;What&#x27;s  changed, as you say, is that on making the discovery I find he  never has had it.  That makes MY attitude&quot; - she paused as thinking  how to express it, then said simply - &quot;all wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come once again,&quot; he pleaded.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you give him his candle?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>He waited, but only because it would sound ungracious; not because  of a doubt of his feeling.  &quot;I can&#x27;t do that!&quot; he declared at last.</p>
<p>&quot;Then good-bye.&quot;  And she gave him her hand again.</p>
<p>He had got his dismissal; besides which, in the agitation of  everything that had opened out to him, he felt the need to recover  himself as he could only do in solitude.  Yet he lingered -  lingered to see if she had no compromise to express, no attenuation  to propose.  But he only met her great lamenting eyes, in which  indeed he read that she was as sorry for him as for any one else.   This made him say:  &quot;At least, in any case, I may see you here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, come if you like.  But I don&#x27;t think it will do.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked round the room once more, knowing how little he was sure  it would do.  He felt also stricken and more and more cold, and his  chill was like an ague in which he had to make an effort not to  shake.  Then he made doleful reply:  &quot;I must try on my side - if  you can&#x27;t try on yours.&quot;  She came out with him to the hall and  into the doorway, and here he put her the question he held he could  least answer from his own wit.  &quot;Why have you never let me come  before?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because my aunt would have seen you, and I should have had to tell  her how I came to know you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what would have been the objection to that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would have entailed other explanations; there would at any rate  have been that danger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Surely she knew you went every day to church,&quot; Stransom objected.</p>
<p>&quot;She didn&#x27;t know what I went for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of me then she never even heard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll think I was deceitful.  But I didn&#x27;t need to be!&quot;</p>
<p>He was now on the lower door-step, and his hostess held the door  half-closed behind him.  Through what remained of the opening he  saw her framed face.  He made a supreme appeal.  &quot;What DID he do to  you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would have come out - SHE would have told you.  That fear at my  heart - that was my reason!&quot;  And she closed the door, shutting him  out.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<p>HE had ruthlessly abandoned her - that of course was what he had  done.  Stransom made it all out in solitude, at leisure, fitting  the unmatched pieces gradually together and dealing one by one with  a hundred obscure points.  She had known Hague only after her  present friend&#x27;s relations with him had wholly terminated;  obviously indeed a good while after; and it was natural enough that  of his previous life she should have ascertained only what he had  judged good to communicate.  There were passages it was quite  conceivable that even in moments of the tenderest expansion he  should have withheld.  Of many facts in the career of a man so in  the eye of the world there was of course a common knowledge; but  this lady lived apart from public affairs, and the only time  perfectly clear to her would have been the time following the dawn  of her own drama.  A man in her place would have &quot;looked up&quot; the  past - would even have consulted old newspapers.  It remained  remarkable indeed that in her long contact with the partner of her  retrospect no accident had lighted a train; but there was no  arguing about that; the accident had in fact come:  it had simply  been that security had prevailed.  She had taken what Hague had  given her, and her blankness in respect of his other connexions was  only a touch in the picture of that plasticity Stransom had supreme  reason to know so great a master could have been trusted to  produce.</p>
<p>This picture was for a while all our friend saw:  he caught his  breath again and again as it came over him that the woman with whom  he had had for years so fine a point of contact was a woman whom  Acton Hague, of all men in the world, had more or less fashioned.   Such as she sat there to-day she was ineffaceably stamped with him.   Beneficent, blameless as Stransom held her, he couldn&#x27;t rid himself  of the sense that he had been, as who should say, swindled.  She  had imposed upon him hugely, though she had known it as little as  he.  All this later past came back to him as a time grotesquely  misspent.  Such at least were his first reflexions; after a while  he found himself more divided and only, as the end of it, more  troubled.  He imagined, recalled, reconstituted, figured out for  himself the truth she had refused to give him; the effect of which  was to make her seem to him only more saturated with her fate.  He  felt her spirit, through the whole strangeness, finer than his own  to the very degree in which she might have been, in which she  certainly had been, more wronged.  A women, when wronged, was  always more wronged than a man, and there were conditions when the  least she could have got off with was more than the most he could  have to bear.  He was sure this rare creature wouldn&#x27;t have got off  with the least.  He was awestruck at the thought of such a  surrender - such a prostration.  Moulded indeed she had been by  powerful hands, to have converted her injury into an exaltation so  sublime.  The fellow had only had to die for everything that was  ugly in him to be washed out in a torrent.  It was vain to try to  guess what had taken place, but nothing could be clearer than that  she had ended by accusing herself.  She absolved him at every  point, she adored her very wounds.  The passion by which he had  profited had rushed back after its ebb, and now the tide of  tenderness, arrested for ever at flood, was too deep even to  fathom.  Stransom sincerely considered that he had forgiven him;  but how little he had achieved the miracle that she had achieved!   His forgiveness was silence, but hers was mere unuttered sound.   The light she had demanded for his altar would have broken his  silence with a blare; whereas all the lights in the church were for  her too great a hush.</p>
<p>She had been right about the difference - she had spoken the truth  about the change:  Stransom was soon to know himself as perversely  but sharply jealous.  HIS tide had ebbed, not flowed; if he had  &quot;forgiven&quot; Acton Hague, that forgiveness was a motive with a broken  spring.  The very fact of her appeal for a material sign, a sign  that should make her dead lover equal there with the others,  presented the concession to her friend as too handsome for the  case.  He had never thought of himself as hard, but an exorbitant  article might easily render him so.  He moved round and round this  one, but only in widening circles - the more he looked at it the  less acceptable it seemed.  At the same time he had no illusion  about the effect of his refusal; he perfectly saw how it would make  for a rupture.  He left her alone a week, but when at last he again  called this conviction was cruelly confirmed.  In the interval he  had kept away from the church, and he needed no fresh assurance  from her to know she hadn&#x27;t entered it.  The change was complete  enough:  it had broken up her life.  Indeed it had broken up his,  for all the fires of his shrine seemed to him suddenly to have been  quenched.  A great indifference fell upon him, the weight of which  was in itself a pain; and he never knew what his devotion had been  for him till in that shock it ceased like a dropped watch.  Neither  did he know with how large a confidence he had counted on the final  service that had now failed:  the mortal deception was that in this  abandonment the whole future gave way.</p>
<p>These days of her absence proved to him of what she was capable;  all the more that he never dreamed she was vindictive or even  resentful.  It was not in anger she had forsaken him; it was in  simple submission to hard reality, to the stern logic of life.   This came home to him when he sat with her again in the room in  which her late aunt&#x27;s conversation lingered like the tone of a  cracked piano.  She tried to make him forget how much they were  estranged, but in the very presence of what they had given up it  was impossible not to be sorry for her.  He had taken from her so  much more than she had taken from him.  He argued with her again,  told her she could now have the altar to herself; but she only  shook her head with pleading sadness, begging him not to waste his  breath on the impossible, the extinct.  Couldn&#x27;t he see that in  relation to her private need the rites he had established were  practically an elaborate exclusion?  She regretted nothing that had  happened; it had all been right so long as she didn&#x27;t know, and it  was only that now she knew too much and that from the moment their  eyes were open they would simply have to conform.  It had doubtless  been happiness enough for them to go on together so long.  She was  gentle, grateful, resigned; but this was only the form of a deep  immoveability.  He saw he should never more cross the threshold of  the second room, and he felt how much this alone would make a  stranger of him and give a conscious stiffness to his visits.  He  would have hated to plunge again into that well of reminders, but  he enjoyed quite as little the vacant alternative.</p>
<p>After he had been with her three or four times it struck him that  to have come at last into her house had had the horrid effect of  diminishing their intimacy.  He had known her better, had liked her  in greater freedom, when they merely walked together or kneeled  together.  Now they only pretended; before they had been nobly  sincere.  They began to try their walks again, but it proved a lame  imitation, for these things, from the first, beginning or ending,  had been connected with their visits to the church.  They had  either strolled away as they came out or gone in to rest on the  return.  Stransom, besides, now faltered; he couldn&#x27;t walk as of  old.  The omission made everything false; it was a dire mutilation  of their lives.  Our friend was frank and monotonous, making no  mystery of his remonstrance and no secret of his predicament.  Her  response, whatever it was, always came to the same thing - an  implied invitation to him to judge, if he spoke of predicaments, of  how much comfort she had in hers.  For him indeed was no comfort  even in complaint, since every allusion to what had befallen them  but made the author of their trouble more present.  Acton Hague was  between them - that was the essence of the matter, and never so  much between them as when they were face to face.  Then Stransom,  while still wanting to banish him, had the strangest sense of  striving for an ease that would involve having accepted him.   Deeply disconcerted by what he knew, he was still worse tormented  by really not knowing.  Perfectly aware that it would have been  horribly vulgar to abuse his old friend or to tell his companion  the story of their quarrel, it yet vexed him that her depth of  reserve should give him no opening and should have the effect of a  magnanimity greater even than his own.</p>
<p>He challenged himself, denounced himself, asked himself if he were  in love with her that he should care so much what adventures she  had had.  He had never for a moment allowed he was in love with  her; therefore nothing could have surprised him more than to  discover he was jealous.  What but jealousy could give a man that  sore contentious wish for the detail of what would make him suffer?   Well enough he knew indeed that he should never have it from the  only person who to-day could give it to him.  She let him press her  with his sombre eyes, only smiling at him with an exquisite mercy  and breathing equally little the word that would expose her secret  and the word that would appear to deny his literal right to  bitterness.  She told nothing, she judged nothing; she accepted  everything but the possibility of her return to the old symbols.   Stransom divined that for her too they had been vividly individual,  had stood for particular hours or particular attributes -  particular links in her chain.  He made it clear to himself, as he  believed, that his difficulty lay in the fact that the very nature  of the plea for his faithless friend constituted a prohibition;  that it happened to have come from HER was precisely the vice that  attached to it.  To the voice of impersonal generosity he felt sure  he would have listened; he would have deferred to an advocate who,  speaking from abstract justice, knowing of his denial without  having known Hague, should have had the imagination to say:  &quot;Ah,  remember only the best of him; pity him; provide for him.&quot;  To  provide for him on the very ground of having discovered another of  his turpitudes was not to pity but to glorify him.  The more  Stransom thought the more he made out that whatever this relation  of Hague&#x27;s it could only have been a deception more or less finely  practised.  Where had it come into the life that all men saw?  Why  had one never heard of it if it had had the frankness of honourable  things?  Stransom knew enough of his other ties, of his obligations  and appearances, not to say enough of his general character, to be  sure there had been some infamy.  In one way or another this  creature had been coldly sacrificed.  That was why at the last as  well as the first he must still leave him out and out.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<p>AND yet this was no solution, especially after he had talked again  to his friend of all it had been his plan she should finally do for  him.  He had talked in the other days, and she had responded with a  frankness qualified only by a courteous reluctance, a reluctance  that touched him, to linger on the question of his death.  She had  then practically accepted the charge, suffered him to feel he could  depend upon her to be the eventual guardian of his shrine; and it  was in the name of what had so passed between them that he appealed  to her not to forsake him in his age.  She listened at present with  shining coldness and all her habitual forbearance to insist on her  terms; her deprecation was even still tenderer, for it expressed  the compassion of her own sense that he was abandoned.  Her terms,  however, remained the same, and scarcely the less audible for not  being uttered; though he was sure that secretly even more than he  she felt bereft of the satisfaction his solemn trust was to have  provided her.  They both missed the rich future, but she missed it  most, because after all it was to have been entirely hers; and it  was her acceptance of the loss that gave him the full measure of  her preference for the thought of Acton Hague over any other  thought whatever.  He had humour enough to laugh rather grimly when  he said to himself:  &quot;Why the deuce does she like him so much more  than she likes me?&quot; - the reasons being really so conceivable.  But  even his faculty of analysis left the irritation standing, and this  irritation proved perhaps the greatest misfortune that had ever  overtaken him.  There had been nothing yet that made him so much  want to give up.  He had of course by this time well reached the  age of renouncement; but it had not hitherto been vivid to him that  it was time to give up everything.</p>
<p>Practically, at the end of six months, he had renounced the  friendship once so charming and comforting.  His privation had two  faces, and the face it had turned to him on the occasion of his  last attempt to cultivate that friendship was the one he could look  at least.  This was the privation he inflicted; the other was the  privation he bore.  The conditions she never phrased he used to  murmur to himself in solitude:  &quot;One more, one more - only just  one.&quot;  Certainly he was going down; he often felt it when he caught  himself, over his work, staring at vacancy and giving voice to that  inanity.  There was proof enough besides in his being so weak and  so ill.  His irritation took the form of melancholy, and his  melancholy that of the conviction that his health had quite failed.   His altar moreover had ceased to exist; his chapel, in his dreams,  was a great dark cavern.  All the lights had gone out - all his  Dead had died again.  He couldn&#x27;t exactly see at first how it had  been in the power of his late companion to extinguish them, since  it was neither for her nor by her that they had been called into  being.  Then he understood that it was essentially in his own soul  the revival had taken place, and that in the air of this soul they  were now unable to breathe.  The candles might mechanically burn,  but each of them had lost its lustre.  The church had become a  void; it was his presence, her presence, their common presence,  that had made the indispensable medium.  If anything was wrong  everything was - her silence spoiled the tune.</p>
<p>Then when three months were gone he felt so lonely that he went  back; reflecting that as they had been his best society for years  his Dead perhaps wouldn&#x27;t let him forsake them without doing  something more for him.  They stood there, as he had left them, in  their tall radiance, the bright cluster that had already made him,  on occasions when he was willing to compare small things with  great, liken them to a group of sea-lights on the edge of the ocean  of life.  It was a relief to him, after a while, as he sat there,  to feel they had still a virtue.  He was more and more easily  tired, and he always drove now; the action of his heart was weak  and gave him none of the reassurance conferred by the action of his  fancy.  None the less he returned yet again, returned several  times, and finally, during six months, haunted the place with a  renewal of frequency and a strain of impatience.  In winter the  church was unwarmed and exposure to cold forbidden him, but the  glow of his shrine was an influence in which he could almost bask.   He sat and wondered to what he had reduced his absent associate and  what she now did with the hours of her absence.  There were other  churches, there were other altars, there were other candles; in one  way or another her piety would still operate; he couldn&#x27;t  absolutely have deprived her of her rites.  So he argued, but  without contentment; for he well enough knew there was no other  such rare semblance of the mountain of light she had once mentioned  to him as the satisfaction of her need.  As this semblance again  gradually grew great to him and his pious practice more regular, he  found a sharper and sharper pang in the imagination of her  darkness; for never so much as in these weeks had his rites been  real, never had his gathered company seemed so to respond and even  to invite.  He lost himself in the large lustre, which was more and  more what he had from the first wished it to be - as dazzling as  the vision of heaven in the mind of a child.  He wandered in the  fields of light; he passed, among the tall tapers, from tier to  tier, from fire to fire, from name to name, from the white  intensity of one clear emblem, of one saved soul, to another.  It  was in the quiet sense of having saved his souls that his deep  strange instinct rejoiced.  This was no dim theological rescue, no  boon of a contingent world; they were saved better than faith or  works could save them, saved for the warm world they had shrunk  from dying to, for actuality, for continuity, for the certainty of  human remembrance.</p>
<p>By this time he had survived all his friends; the last straight  flame was three years old, there was no one to add to the list.   Over and over he called his roll, and it appeared to him compact  and complete.  Where should he put in another, where, if there were  no other objection, would it stand in its place in the rank?  He  reflected, with a want of sincerity of which he was quite  conscious, that it would be difficult to determine that place.   More and more, besides, face to face with his little legion, over  endless histories, handling the empty shells and playing with the  silence - more and more he could see that he had never introduced  an alien.  He had had his great companions, his indulgences - there  were cases in which they had been immense; but what had his  devotion after all been if it hadn&#x27;t been at bottom a respect?  He  was, however, himself surprised at his stiffness; by the end of the  winter the responsibility of it was what was uppermost in his  thoughts.  The refrain had grown old to them, that plea for just  one more.  There came a day when, for simple exhaustion, if  symmetry should demand just one he was ready so far to meet  symmetry.  Symmetry was harmony, and the idea of harmony began to  haunt him; he said to himself that harmony was of course  everything.  He took, in fancy, his composition to pieces,  redistributing it into other lines, making other juxtapositions and  contrasts.  He shifted this and that candle, he made the spaces  different, he effaced the disfigurement of a possible gap.  There  were subtle and complex relations, a scheme of cross-reference, and  moments in which he seemed to catch a glimpse of the void so  sensible to the woman who wandered in exile or sat where he had  seen her with the portrait of Acton Hague.  Finally, in this way,  he arrived at a conception of the total, the ideal, which left a  clear opportunity for just another figure.  &quot;Just one more - to  round it off; just one more, just one,&quot; continued to hum in his  head.  There was a strange confusion in the thought, for he felt  the day to be near when he too should be one of the Others.  What  in this event would the Others matter to him, since they only  mattered to the living?  Even as one of the Dead what would his  altar matter to him, since his particular dream of keeping it up  had melted away?  What had harmony to do with the case if his  lights were all to be quenched?  What he had hoped for was an  instituted thing.  He might perpetuate it on some other pretext,  but his special meaning would have dropped.  This meaning was to  have lasted with the life of the one other person who understood  it.</p>
<p>In March he had an illness during which he spent a fortnight in  bed, and when he revived a little he was told of two things that  had happened.  One was that a lady whose name was not known to the  servants (she left none) had been three times to ask about him; the  other was that in his sleep and on an occasion when his mind  evidently wandered he was heard to murmur again and again:  &quot;Just  one more - just one.&quot;  As soon as he found himself able to go out,  and before the doctor in attendance had pronounced him so, he drove  to see the lady who had come to ask about him.  She was not at  home; but this gave him the opportunity, before his strength should  fall again, to take his way to the church.  He entered it alone; he  had declined, in a happy manner he possessed of being able to  decline effectively, the company of his servant or of a nurse.  He  knew now perfectly what these good people thought; they had  discovered his clandestine connexion, the magnet that had drawn him  for so many years, and doubtless attached a significance of their  own to the odd words they had repeated to him.  The nameless lady  was the clandestine connexion - a fact nothing could have made  clearer than his indecent haste to rejoin her.  He sank on his  knees before his altar while his head fell over on his hands.  His  weakness, his life&#x27;s weariness overtook him.  It seemed to him he  had come for the great surrender.  At first he asked himself how he  should get away; then, with the failing belief in the power, the  very desire to move gradually left him.  He had come, as he always  came, to lose himself; the fields of light were still there to  stray in; only this time, in straying, he would never come back.   He had given himself to his Dead, and it was good:  this time his  Dead would keep him.  He couldn&#x27;t rise from his knees; he believed  he should never rise again; all he could do was to lift his face  and fix his eyes on his lights.  They looked unusually, strangely  splendid, but the one that always drew him most had an  unprecedented lustre.  It was the central voice of the choir, the  glowing heart of the brightness, and on this occasion it seemed to  expand, to spread great wings of flame.  The whole altar flared -  dazzling and blinding; but the source of the vast radiance burned  clearer than the rest, gathering itself into form, and the form was  human beauty and human charity, was the far-off face of Mary  Antrim.  She smiled at him from the glory of heaven - she brought  the glory down with her to take him.  He bowed his head in  submission and at the same moment another wave rolled over him.   Was it the quickening of joy to pain?  In the midst of his joy at  any rate he felt his buried face grow hot as with some communicated  knowledge that had the force of a reproach.  It suddenly made him  contrast that very rapture with the bliss he had refused to  another.  This breath of the passion immortal was all that other  had asked; the descent of Mary Antrim opened his spirit with a  great compunctious throb for the descent of Acton Hague.  It was as  if Stransom had read what her eyes said to him.</p>
<p>After a moment he looked round in a despair that made him feel as  if the source of life were ebbing.  The church had been empty - he  was alone; but he wanted to have something done, to make a last  appeal.  This idea gave him strength for an effort; he rose to his  feet with a movement that made him turn, supporting himself by the  back of a bench.  Behind him was a prostrate figure, a figure he  had seen before; a woman in deep mourning, bowed in grief or in  prayer.  He had seen her in other days - the first time of his  entrance there, and he now slightly wavered, looking at her again  till she seemed aware he had noticed her.  She raised her head and  met his eyes:  the partner of his long worship had come back.  She  looked across at him an instant with a face wondering and scared;  he saw he had made her afraid.  Then quickly rising she came  straight to him with both hands out.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you COULD come?  God sent you!&quot; he murmured with a happy  smile.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re very ill - you shouldn&#x27;t be here,&quot; she urged in anxious  reply.</p>
<p>&quot;God sent me too, I think.  I was ill when I came, but the sight of  you does wonders.&quot;  He held her hands, which steadied and quickened  him.  &quot;I&#x27;ve something to tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t tell me!&quot; she tenderly pleaded; &quot;let me tell you.  This  afternoon, by a miracle, the sweetest of miracles, the sense of our  difference left me.  I was out - I was near, thinking, wandering  alone, when, on the spot, something changed in my heart.  It&#x27;s my  confession - there it is.  To come back, to come back on the  instant - the idea gave me wings.  It was as if I suddenly saw  something - as if it all became possible.  I could come for what  you yourself came for:  that was enough.  So here I am.  It&#x27;s not  for my own - that&#x27;s over.  But I&#x27;m here for THEM.&quot;  And breathless,  infinitely relieved by her low precipitate explanation, she looked  with eyes that reflected all its splendour at the magnificence of  their altar.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;re here for you,&quot; Stransom said, &quot;they&#x27;re present to-night as  they&#x27;ve never been.  They speak for you - don&#x27;t you see? - in a  passion of light; they sing out like a choir of angels.  Don&#x27;t you  hear what they say? - they offer the very thing you asked of me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t talk of it - don&#x27;t think of it; forget it!&quot;  She spoke in  hushed supplication, and while the alarm deepened in her eyes she  disengaged one of her hands and passed an arm round him to support  him better, to help him to sink into a seat.</p>
<p>He let himself go, resting on her; he dropped upon the bench and  she fell on her knees beside him, his own arm round her shoulder.   So he remained an instant, staring up at his shrine.  &quot;They say  there&#x27;s a gap in the array - they say it&#x27;s not full, complete.   Just one more,&quot; he went on, softly - &quot;isn&#x27;t that what you wanted?   Yes, one more, one more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah no more - no more!&quot; she wailed, as with a quick new horror of  it, under her breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, one more,&quot; he repeated, simply; &quot;just one!&quot;  And with this  his head dropped on her shoulder; she felt that in his weakness he  had fainted.  But alone with him in the dusky church a great dread  was on her of what might still happen, for his face had the  whiteness of death.</p>
