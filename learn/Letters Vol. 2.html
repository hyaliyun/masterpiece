<p>DEAR BRET,--I take my pen in hand to inform you that I am well and hope
these few lines will find you enjoying the same God&#x27;s blessing.</p>
<p>The book is out, and is handsome.  It is full of damnable errors of
grammar and deadly inconsistencies of spelling in the Frog sketch because
I was away and did not read the proofs; but be a friend and say nothing
about these things.  When my hurry is over, I will send you an autograph
copy to pisen the children with.</p>
<p>I am to lecture in Cooper Institute next Monday night.  Pray for me.</p>
<p>We sail for the Holy Land June 8.  Try to write me (to this hotel,) and
it will be forwarded to Paris, where we remain 10 or 15 days.</p>
<p>Regards and best wishes to Mrs. Bret and the family.
Truly Yr Friend
MARK.</p>

<p>DEAR FOLKS,--Don&#x27;t expect me to write for a while.  My hands are full of
business on account of my lecture for the 6th inst., and everything looks
shady, at least, if not dark.  I have got a good agent--but now after we
have hired Cooper Institute and gone to an expense in one way or another
of $500, it comes out that I have got to play against Speaker Colfax at
Irving Hall, Ristori, and also the double troupe of Japanese jugglers,
the latter opening at the great Academy of Music--and with all this
against me I have taken the largest house in New York and cannot back
water.  Let her slide!  If nobody else cares I don&#x27;t.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll send the book soon.  I am awfully hurried now, but not worried.
Yrs.
SAM.</p>
<p>The Cooper Union lecture proved a failure, and a success.  When it became
evident to Fuller that the venture was not going to pay, he sent out a
flood of complimentaries to the school-teachers of New York City and the
surrounding districts.  No one seems to have declined them.  Clemens
lectured to a jammed house and acquired much reputation.  Lecture
proposals came from several directions, but he could not accept them now.
He wrote home that he was eighteen Alta letters behind and had refused
everything.  Thos. Nast, the cartoonist, then in his first fame, propped
a joint tour, Clemens to lecture while he, Nast, would illustrate with
&quot;lightning&quot; sketches; but even this could not be considered now.  In a
little while he would sail, and the days were overfull.  A letter written
a week before he sailed is full of the hurry and strain of these last
days.</p>

<p>DEAR FOLKS,--I know I ought to write oftener (just got your last,) and
more fully, but I cannot overcome my repugnance to telling what I am
doing or what I expect to do or propose to do.  Then, what have I left to
write about?  Manifestly nothing.</p>
<p>It isn&#x27;t any use for me to talk about the voyage, because I can have no
faith in that voyage till the ship is under way.  How do I know she will
ever sail?  My passage is paid, and if the ship sails, I sail in her--but
I make no calculations, have bought no cigars, no sea-going clothing
--have made no preparation whatever--shall not pack my trunk till the
morning we sail.  Yet my hands are full of what I am going to do the day
before we sail--and what isn&#x27;t done that day will go undone.</p>
<p>All I do know or feel, is, that I am wild with impatience to move--move
--move!  Half a dozen times I have wished I had sailed long ago in some
ship that wasn&#x27;t going to keep me chained here to chafe for lagging ages
while she got ready to go.  Curse the endless delays!  They always kill
me--they make me neglect every duty and then I have a conscience that
tears me like a wild beast.  I wish I never had to stop anywhere a month.
I do more mean things, the moment I get a chance to fold my hands and sit
down than ever I can get forgiveness for.</p>
<p>Yes, we are to meet at Mr. Beach&#x27;s next Thursday night, and I suppose we
shall have to be gotten up regardless of expense, in swallow-tails, white
kids and everything en regle.</p>
<p>I am resigned to Rev. Mr. Hutchinson&#x27;s or anybody else&#x27;s supervision.
I don&#x27;t mind it.  I am fixed.  I have got a splendid, immoral, tobacco-
smoking, wine-drinking, godless room-mate who is as good and true and
right-minded a man as ever lived--a man whose blameless conduct and
example will always be an eloquent sermon to all who shall come within
their influence.  But send on the professional preachers--there are none
I like better to converse with.  If they&#x27;re not narrow minded and bigoted
they make good companions.</p>
<p>I asked them to send the N. Y. Weekly to you--no charge.  I am not going
to write for it.  Like all other, papers that pay one splendidly it
circulates among stupid people and the &#x27;canaille.&#x27;  I have made no
arrangement with any New York paper--I will see about that Monday or
Tuesday.
Love to all
Good bye,

<p>DEAR FOLKS, I suppose we shall be many a league at sea tomorrow night, and goodness knows I shall be unspeakably glad of it.</p>
<p>I haven&#x27;t got anything to write, else I would write it.  I have just written myself clear out in letters to the Alta, and I think they are the stupidest letters that were ever written from New York.  Corresponding has been a perfect drag ever since I got to the states.  If it continues abroad, I don&#x27;t know what the Tribune and Alta folks will think. I have withdrawn the Sandwich Island book--it would be useless to publish it in these dull publishing times.  As for the Frog book, I don&#x27;t believe that will ever pay anything worth a cent.  I published it simply to advertise myself--not with the hope of making anything out of it.</p>
<p>Well, I haven&#x27;t anything to write, except that I am tired of staying in one place--that I am in a fever to get away.  Read my Alta letters--they contain everything I could possibly write to you.  Tell Zeb and John Leavenworth to write me.  They can get plenty of gossip from the pilots.</p>
<p>An importing house sent two cases of exquisite champagne aboard the ship for me today--Veuve Clicquot and Lac d&#x27;Or.  I and my room-mate have set apart every Saturday as a solemn fast day, wherein we will entertain no light matters of frivolous conversation, but only get drunk.  (That is a joke.) His mother and sisters are the best and most homelike people I have yet found in a brown stone front.  There is no style about them, except in house and furniture.</p>
<p>I wish Orion were going on this voyage, for I believe he could not help but be cheerful and jolly.  I often wonder if his law business is going satisfactorily to him, but knowing that the dull season is setting in now (it looked like it had already set in before) I have felt as if I could almost answer the question myself--which is to say in plain words, I was afraid to ask.  I wish I had gone to Washington in the winter instead of going West.  I could have gouged an office out of Bill Stewart for him, and that would atone for the loss of my home visit.  But I am so worthless that it seems to me I never do anything or accomplish anything that lingers in my mind as a pleasant memory.  My mind is stored full of unworthy conduct toward Orion and towards you all, and an accusing conscience gives me peace only in excitement and restless moving from place to place.  If I could say I had done one thing for any of you that entitled me to your good opinion, (I say nothing of your love, for I am sure of that, no matter how unworthy of it I may make myself, from Orion down you have always given me that, all the days of my life, when God Almighty knows I seldom deserve it,) I believe I could go home and stay there and I know I would care little for the world&#x27;s praise or blame. There is no satisfaction in the world&#x27;s praise anyhow, and it has no worth to me save in the way of business.  I tried to gather up its compliments to send to you, but the work was distasteful and I dropped it.</p>
<p>You observe that under a cheerful exterior I have got a spirit that is angry with me and gives me freely its contempt.  I can get away from that at sea, and be tranquil and satisfied-and so, with my parting love and benediction for Orion and all of you, I say goodbye and God bless you all--and welcome the wind that wafts a weary soul to the sunny lands of the Mediterranean!                               Yrs.  Forever,                                              SAM.</p>

<p>LETTERS 1867.  THE TRAVELER.  THE VOYAGE OF THE &quot;QUAKER CITY&quot;</p>
<p>Mark Twain, now at sea, was writing many letters; not personal letters, but those unique descriptive relations of travel which would make him his first great fame--those fresh first impressions preserved to us now as chapters of The Innocents Abroad.  Yet here and there in the midst of sight-seeing and reporting he found time to send a brief line to those at home, merely that they might have a word from his own hand, for he had ordered the papers to which he was to contribute--the Alta and the New York Tribune--sent to them, and these would give the story of his travels.  The home letters read like notebook entries.</p>

DEAR FOLKS,--We have been representing the United States all we knew how today.  We went to Sebastopol, after we got tired of Constantinople (got your letter there, and one at Naples,) and there the Commandant and the whole town came aboard and were as jolly and sociable as old friends. They said the Emperor of Russia was at Yalta, 30 miles or 40 away, and urged us to go there with the ship and visit him--promised us a cordial welcome.  They insisted on sending a telegram to the Emperor, and also a courier overland to announce our coming.  But we knew that a great English Excursion party, and also the Viceroy of Egypt, in his splendid yacht, had been refused an audience within the last fortnight, so we thought it not safe to try it.  They said, no difference--the Emperor would hardly visit our ship, because that would be a most extraordinary favor, and one which he uniformly refuses to accord under any circumstances, but he would certainly receive us at his palace.  We still declined.  But we had to go to Odessa, 250 miles away, and there the Governor General urged us, and sent a telegram to the Emperor, which we hardly expected to be answered, but it was, and promptly.  So we sailed back to Yalta.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>We all went to the palace at noon, today, (3 miles) in carriages and on horses sent by the Emperor, and we had a jolly time.  Instead of the usual formal audience of 15 minutes, we staid 4 hours and were made a good deal more at home than we could have been in a New York drawing- room.  The whole tribe turned out to receive our party-Emperor, Empress, the oldest daughter (Grand-Duchess Marie, a pretty girl of 14,) a little Grand Duke, her brother, and a platoon of Admirals, Princes, Peers of the Empire, etc., and in a little while an aid-de-camp arrived with a request from the Grand Duke Michael, the Emperor&#x27;s brother, that we would visit his palace and breakfast with him.  The Emperor also invited us, on behalf of his absent eldest son and heir (aged 22,) to visit his palace and consider it a visit to him.  They all talk English and they were all very neatly but very plainly dressed.  You all dress a good deal finer than they were dressed.  The Emperor and his family threw off all reserve and showed us all over the palace themselves.  It is very rich and very elegant, but in no way gaudy.</p>
<p>I had been appointed chairman of a committee to draught an address to the Emperor in behalf of the passengers, and as I fully expected, and as they fully intended, I had to write the address myself.  I didn&#x27;t mind it, because I have no modesty and would as soon write to an Emperor as to anybody else--but considering that there were 5 on the committee I thought they might have contributed one paragraph among them, anyway. They wanted me to read it to him, too, but I declined that honor--not because I hadn&#x27;t cheek enough (and some to spare,) but because our Consul at Odessa was along, and also the Secretary of our Legation at St. Petersburgh, and of course one of those ought to read it.  The Emperor accepted the address--it was his business to do it--and so many others have praised it warmly that I begin to imagine it must be a wonderful sort of document and herewith send you the original draught of it to be put into alcohol and preserved forever like a curious reptile.</p>
<p>They live right well at the Grand Duke Michael&#x27;s their breakfasts are not gorgeous but very excellent--and if Mike were to say the word I would go there and breakfast with him tomorrow.                                    Yrs aff                                              SAM.</p>
<p>P. S.  [Written across the face of the last page.] They had told us it would be polite to invite the Emperor to visit the ship, though he would not be likely to do it.  But he didn&#x27;t give us a chance--he has requested permission to come on board with his family and all his relations tomorrow and take a sail, in case it is calm weather.  I can, entertain them.  My hand is in, now, and if you want any more Emperors feted in style, trot them out.</p>

I wrote them as follows:      1 Letter from Fayal, in the Azores Islands.      1 from Gibraltar, in Spain.      1 from Tangier, in Africa.      2 from Paris and Marseilles, in France.      1 from Genoa, in Italy.      1 from Milan.      1 from Lake Como.      1 from some little place in Switzerland--have forgotten the name.      4 concerning Lecce, Bergamo, Padua, Verona, Battlefield of Marengo, Pestachio, and some other cities in Northern Italy.      2 from Venice.      1 about Bologna.      1 from Florence.      1 from Pisa.      1 from Leghorn.      1 from Rome and Civita Vecchia.      2 from Naples.      1 about Pazzuoli, where St. Paul landed, the Baths of Nero, and the ruins of Baia, Virgil&#x27;s tomb, the Elysian Fields, the Sunken Cities and the spot where Ulysses landed.      1 from Herculaneum and Vesuvius.      1 from Pompeii.      1 from the Island of Ischia.      1 concerning the Volcano of Stromboli, the city and Straits of Messina, the land of Sicily, Scylla and Charybdis etc.      1 about the Grecian Archipelago.      1 about a midnight visit to Athens, the Piraeus and the ruins of the Acropolis.      1 about the Hellespont, the site of ancient Troy, the Sea of Marmara, etc.      2 about Constantinople, the Golden Horn and the beauties of the Bosphorus.      1 from Odessa and Sebastopol in Russia, the Black Sea, etc.      2 from Yalta, Russia, concerning a visit to the Czar. And yesterday I wrote another letter from Constantinople and      1 today about its neighbor in Asia, Scatter.  I am not done with Turkey yet.  Shall write 2 or 3 more.</p>
<p>I have written to the New York Herald 2 letters from Naples, (no name signed,) and 1 from Constantinople.</p>
<p>To the New York Tribune I have written      1 from Fayal.      1 from Civita Vecchia in the Roman States.      2 from Yalta, Russia.      And 1 from Constantinople.</p>
<p>I have never seen any of these letters in print except the one to the Tribune from Fayal and that was not worth printing.</p>
<p>We sail hence tomorrow, perhaps, and my next letters will be mailed at Smyrna, in Syria.  I hope to write from the Sea of Tiberius, Damascus, Jerusalem, Joppa, and possibly other points in the Holy Land.  The letters from Egypt, the Nile and Algiers I will look out for, myself. I will bring them in my pocket.</p>
<p>They take the finest photographs in the world here.  I have ordered some. They will be sent to Alexandria, Egypt.</p>
<p>You cannot conceive of anything so beautiful as Constantinople, viewed from the Golden Horn or the Bosphorus.  I think it must be the handsomest city in the world.  I will go on deck and look at it for you, directly. I am staying in the ship, tonight.  I generally stay on shore when we are in port.  But yesterday I just ran myself down.  Dan Slote, my room-mate, is on shore.  He remained here while we went up the Black Sea, but it seems he has not got enough of it yet.  I thought Dan had got the state- room pretty full of rubbish at last, but a while ago his dragoman arrived with a bran new, ghastly tomb-stone of the Oriental pattern, with his name handsomely carved and gilded on it, in Turkish characters.  That fellow will buy a Circassian slave, next.</p>
<p>I am tired.  We are going on a trip, tomorrow.  I must to bed.  Love to all.                Yrs                     SAM.</p>

DEAR FOLKS,--We left Gibraltar at noon and rode to Algeciras, (4 hours) thus dodging the quarantine, took dinner and then rode horseback all night in a swinging trot and at daylight took a caleche (a wheeled vehicle) and rode 5 hours--then took cars and traveled till twelve at night.  That landed us at Seville and we were over the hard part of our trip, and somewhat tired.  Since then we have taken things comparatively easy, drifting around from one town to another and attracting a good deal of attention, for I guess strangers do not wander through Andalusia and the other Southern provinces of Spain often.

<p>But I see now what the glory of Spain must have been when it was under Moorish domination.  No, I will not say that, but then when one is carried away, infatuated, entranced, with the wonders of the Alhambra and the supernatural beauty of the Alcazar, he is apt to overflow with admiration for the splendid intellects that created them.</p>
<p>I cannot write now.  I am only dropping a line to let you know I am well. The ship will call for us here tomorrow.  We may stop at Lisbon, and shall at the Bermudas, and will arrive in New York ten days after this letter gets there.                                    SAM.</p>

<p>LETTERS 1867-68.  WASHINGTON AND SAN FRANCISCO. THE PROPOSED BOOK OF TRAVEL.  A NEW LECTURE</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> From Mark Twain&#x27;s home letters we get several important side-lights      on this first famous book.  We learn, for in stance, that it was he      who drafted the ship address to the Emperor--the opening lines of      which became so wearisome when repeated by the sailors.      Furthermore, we learn something of the scope and extent of his      newspaper correspondence, which must have kept him furiously busy,      done as it was in the midst of super-heated and continuous sight-      seeing.  He wrote fifty three letters to the Alta-California, six to      the New York Tribune, and at least two to the New York Herald more      than sixty, all told, of an average, length of three to four      thousand words each. Mark Twain always claimed to be a lazy man, and      certainly he was likely to avoid an undertaking not suited to his      gifts, but he had energy in abundance for work in his chosen field.      To have piled up a correspondence of that size in the time, and      under the circumstances already noted, quality considered, may be      counted a record in the history of travel letters.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They made him famous.  Arriving in New York, November 19, 1867, Mark      Twain found himself no longer unknown to the metropolis, or to any      portion of America.  Papers East and West had copied his Alta and      Tribune letters and carried his name into every corner of the States      and Territories.  He had preached a new gospel in travel literature,      the gospel of frankness and sincerity that Americans could      understand.  Also his literary powers had awakened at last.  His      work was no longer trivial, crude, and showy; it was full of      dignity, beauty, and power; his humor was finer, worthier.  The      difference in quality between the Quaker City letters and those      written from the Sandwich Islands only a year before can scarcely be      measured.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He did not remain in New York, but went down to Washington, where he      had arranged for a private secretaryship with Senator William M.

<p>DR. SIR,--We take the liberty to address you this, in place of a letter which we had recently written and was about to forward to you, not knowing your arrival home was expected so soon.  We are desirous of obtaining from you a work of some kind, perhaps compiled from your letters from the East, &amp;c., with such interesting additions as may be proper.  We are the publishers of A. D. Richardson&#x27;s works, and flatter ourselves that we can give an author as favorable terms and do as full justice to his productions as any other house in the country.  We are perhaps the oldest subscription house in the country, and have never failed to give a book an immense circulation.  We sold about 100,000 copies of Richardson&#x27;s F. D. &amp; E.  (Field, Dungeon and Escape) and are now printing 41,000, of &quot;Beyond the Mississippi,&quot; and large orders ahead. If you have any thought of writing a book, or could be induced to do so, we should be pleased to see you; and will do so.  Will you do us the favor to reply at once, at your earliest convenience.                                    Very truly, &amp;c.,                                                   E.

<p>DEAR SIR,--I only received your favor of Nov. 21st last night, at the rooms of the Tribune Bureau here.  It was forwarded from the Tribune office, New York, where it had lain eight or ten days.  This will be a sufficient apology for the seeming discourtesy of my silence.</p>
<p>I wrote fifty-two (three) letters for the San Francisco &quot;Alta California&quot; during the Quaker City excursion, about half of which number have been printed, thus far.  The &quot;Alta&quot; has few exchanges in the East, and I suppose scarcely any of these letters have been copied on this side of the Rocky Mountains.  I could weed them of their chief faults of construction and inelegancies of expression and make a volume that would be more acceptable in many respects than any I could now write.  When those letters were written my impressions were fresh, but now they have lost that freshness; they were warm then--they are cold, now.  I could strike out certain letters, and write new ones wherewith to supply their places.  If you think such a book would suit your purpose, please drop me a line, specifying the size and general style of the volume; when the matter ought to be ready; whether it should have pictures in it or not; and particularly what your terms with me would be, and what amount of money I might possibly make out of it.  The latter clause has a degree of importance for me which is almost beyond my own comprehension.  But you understand that, of course.</p>
<p>I have other propositions for a book, but have doubted the propriety of interfering with good newspaper engagements, except my way as an author could be demonstrated to be plain before me.  But I know Richardson, and learned from him some months ago, something of an idea of the subscription plan of publishing.  If that is your plan invariably, it looks safe.</p>
<p>I am on the N. Y. Tribune staff here as an &quot;occasional,&quot;, among other things, and a note from you addressed to                                    Very truly &amp;c.                                              SAM L. CLEMENS,</p>
<p>New York Tribune Bureau, Washington, will find me, without fail.</p>

<p>I have just arrived from New York-been there ever since Christmas staying at the house of Dan Slote my Quaker City room-mate, and having a splendid time.  Charley Langdon, Jack Van Nostrand, Dan and I, (all Quaker City night-hawks,) had a blow-out at Dan&#x27;s&#x27; house and a lively talk over old times.  We went through the Holy Land together, and I just laughed till my sides ached, at some of our reminiscences.  It was the unholiest gang that ever cavorted through Palestine, but those are the best boys in the world.  We needed Moulton badly.  I started to make calls, New Year&#x27;s Day, but I anchored for the day at the first house I came to--Charlie Langdon&#x27;s sister was there (beautiful girl,) and Miss Alice Hooker, another beautiful girl, a niece of Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s.  We sent the old folks home early, with instructions not to send the carriage till midnight, and then I just staid there and worried the life out of those girls.  I am going to spend a few days with the Langdon&#x27;s in Elmira, New York, as soon as I get time, and a few days at Mrs. Hooker&#x27;s in Hartford, Conn., shortly.</p>
<p>Henry Ward Beecher sent for me last Sunday to come over and dine (he lives in Brooklyn, you know,) and I went.  Harriet Beecher Stowe was there, and Mrs. and Miss Beecher, Mrs. Hooker and my old Quaker City favorite, Emma Beach.</p>
<p>We had a very gay time, if it was Sunday.  I expect I told more lies than I have told before in a month.</p>
<p>I went back by invitation, after the evening service, and finished the blow-out, and then staid all night at Mr. Beach&#x27;s.  Henry Ward is a brick.</p>
<p>I found out at 10 o&#x27;clock, last night, that I was to lecture tomorrow evening and so you must be aware that I have been working like sin all night to get a lecture written.  I have finished it, I call it &quot;Frozen Truth.&quot;  It is a little top-heavy, though, because there is more truth in the title than there is in the lecture.</p>
<p>But thunder, I mustn&#x27;t sit here writing all day, with so much business before me.</p>
<p>Good by, and kind regards to all.                          Yrs affy                                    SAM L. CLEMENS.</p>

It was too late to do anything--too late to stop the lecture.  I scared up a door-keeper, and was ready at the proper time, and by pure good luck a tolerably good house assembled and I was saved!

Jan. 24-68. DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,--This is a good week for me.  I stopped in the Herald office as I came through New York, to see the boys on the staff, and young James Gordon Bennett asked me to write twice a week, impersonally, for the Herald, and said if I would I might have full swing, and (write) about anybody and everybody I wanted to.  I said I must have the very fullest possible swing, and he said &quot;all right.&quot; I said &quot;It&#x27;s a contract--&quot; and that settled that matter.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>I&#x27;ll make it a point to write one letter a week, any-how.</p>
<p>But the best thing that has happened was here.  This great American Publishing Company kept on trying to bargain with me for a book till I thought I would cut the matter short by coming up for a talk.  I met Rev. Henry Ward Beecher in Brooklyn, and with his usual whole-souled way of dropping his own work to give other people a lift when he gets a chance, he said, &quot;Now, here, you are one of the talented men of the age--nobody is going to deny that---but in matters of business, I don&#x27;t suppose you know more than enough to came in when it rains.  I&#x27;ll tell you what to do, and how to do it.&quot;  And he did.</p>
<p>And I listened well, and then came up here and made a splendid contract for a Quaker City book of 5 or 600 large pages, with illustrations, the manuscript to be placed in the publishers&#x27; hands by the middle of July. My percentage is to be a fifth more than they have ever paid any author, except Horace Greeley.  Beecher will be surprised, I guess, when he hears this.</p>
<p>But I had my mind made up to one thing--I wasn&#x27;t going to touch a book unless there was money in it, and a good deal of it.  I told them so. I had the misfortune to &quot;bust out&quot; one author of standing.  They had his manuscript, with the understanding that they would publish his book if they could not get a book from me, (they only publish two books at a time, and so my book and Richardson&#x27;s Life of Grant will fill the bill for next fall and winter)--so that manuscript was sent back to its author today.</p>
<p>These publishers get off the most tremendous editions of their books you can imagine.  I shall write to the Enterprise and Alta every week, as usual, I guess, and to the Herald twice a week--occasionally to the Tribune and the Magazines (I have a stupid article in the Galaxy, just issued) but I am not going to write to this, that and the other paper any more.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune wants letters, but I hope and pray I have charged them so much that they will not close the contract.  I am gradually getting out of debt, but these trips to New York do cost like sin. I hope you have cut out and forwarded my printed letters to Washington --please continue to do so as they arrive.</p>
<p>I have had a tip-top time, here, for a few days (guest of Mr. Jno. Hooker&#x27;s family--Beecher&#x27;s relatives-in a general way of Mr. Bliss, also, who is head of the publishing firm.) Puritans are mighty straight-laced and they won&#x27;t let me smoke in the parlor, but the Almighty don&#x27;t make any better people.</p>
<p>Love to all-good-bye.  I shall be in New York 3 days--then go on to the Capital.                     Yrs affly, especially Ma.,                                                   Yr SAM.</p>
<p>I have to make a speech at the annual Herald dinner on the 6th of May.</p>

A verbal agreement between Bliss and Clemens had been      reached, to be ratified by an exchange of letters in the near      future.  Bliss had made two propositions, viz., ten thousand      dollars, cash in hand, or a 5-per-cent. royalty on the selling price      of the book.  The cash sum offered looked very large to Mark Twain,      and he was sorely tempted to accept it.  He had faith, however, in      the book, and in Bliss&#x27;s ability to sell it.  He agreed, therefore,      to the royalty proposition; &quot;The best business judgment I ever      displayed&quot; he often declared in after years.  Five per cent.      royalty sounds rather small in these days of more liberal contracts.      But the American Publishing Company sold its books only by      subscription, and the agents&#x27; commissions and delivery expenses ate      heavily into the profits.  Clemens was probably correct in saying      that his percentage was larger than had been paid to any previous      author except Horace Greeley.  The John Hooker mentioned was the      husband of Henry Ward Beecher&#x27;s sister, Isabel.  It was easy to      understand the Beecher family&#x27;s robust appreciation of Mark Twain.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> From the office of Dan Slote, his room-mate of the Quaker City--      &quot;Dan&quot; of the Innocents--Clemens wrote his letter that closed the      agreement with Bliss.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                To Elisha Bliss, Jr., in Hartford:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">           Office of SLOTE &amp; WOODMAN, Blank Book Manufacturers,                                    Nos. 119-121 William St.                                         NEW YORK, January 27, 1868.

<p>DEAR SIR, Your favor of Jan. 25th is received, and in reply, I will say that I accede to your several propositions, viz: That I furnish to the American Publishing Company, through you, with MSS sufficient for a volume of 500 to 600 pages, the subject to be the Quaker City, the voyage, description of places, &amp;c., and also embodying the substance of the letters written by me during that trip, said MSS to be ready about the first of August, next, I to give all the usual and necessary attention in preparing said MSS for the press, and in preparation of illustrations, in correction of proofs--no use to be made by me of the material for this work in any way which will conflict with its interest --the book to be sold by the American Publishing Co., by subscription-- and for said MS and labor on my part said Company to pay me a copyright of 5 percent, upon the subscription price of the book for all copies sold.</p>

<p>When I found that a personal friend of mine, the Chief Editor of the Alta was an applicant I said I didn&#x27;t want it--I would not take $10,000 a year out of a friend&#x27;s pocket.</p>
<p>The two months have passed, I heard day before yesterday that a new and almost unknown candidate had suddenly turned up on the inside track, and was to be appointed at once.  I didn&#x27;t like that, and went after his case in a fine passion.  I hunted up all our Senators and representatives and found that his name was actually to come from the President early in the morning.</p>
<p>Then Judge Field said if I wanted the place he could pledge me the President&#x27;s appointment--and Senator Conness said he would guarantee me the Senate&#x27;s confirmation.  It was a great temptation, but it would render it impossible to fill my book contract, and I had to drop the idea.</p>
<p>I have to spend August and September in Hartford which isn&#x27;t San Francisco.  Mr. Conness offers me any choice out of five influential California offices.  Now, some day or other I shall want an office and then, just my luck, I can&#x27;t get it, I suppose.</p>
<p>They want to send me abroad, as a Consul or a Minister.  I said I didn&#x27;t want any of the pie.  God knows I am mean enough and lazy enough, now, without being a foreign consul.</p>
<p>Sometime in the course of the present century I think they will create a Commissioner of Patents, and then I hope to get a berth for Orion.</p>
<p>I published 6 or 7 letters in the Tribune while I was gone, now I cannot get them.  I suppose I must have them copied.                                    Love to all                                               SAM.</p>
<p>Orion Clemens was once more a candidate for office: Nevada had become a State; with regularly elected officials, and Orion had somehow missed being chosen.  His day of authority had passed, and the law having failed to support him, he was again back at his old occupation, setting type in St. Louis.  He was, as ever, full of dreams and inventions that would some day lead to fortune.  With the gift of the Sellers imagination, inherited by all the family, he lacked the driving power which means achievement.  More and more as the years went by he would lean upon his brother for moral and physical support.  The chances for him in Washington do not appear to have been bright.  The political situation under Andrew Johnson was not a happy one.</p>

I hope you will set type till you complete that invention, for surely government pap must be nauseating food for a man--a man whom God has enabled to saw wood and be independent.  It really seemed to me a falling from grace, the idea of going back to San Francisco nothing better than a mere postmaster, albeit the public would have thought I came with gilded honors, and in great glory.</p>
<p>I only retain correspondence enough, now, to make a living for myself, and have discarded all else, so that I may have time to spare for the book.  Drat the thing, I wish it were done, or that I had no other writing to do.</p>

There had been no contract      which would prevent this, and the correspondence which Clemens      undertook with the Alta management led to nothing.  He knew that he      had powerful friends among the owners, if he could reach them      personally, and he presently concluded to return to San Francisco,      make what arrangement he could, and finish his book there.

<p>The San Francisco trip proved successful.  Once on the ground Clemens had little difficulty in convincing the Alta publishers that they had received full value in the newspaper use of the letters, and that the book rights remained with the author.  A letter to Bliss conveys the situation.</p>

He ended this tour with a second      lecture in San Francisco, announced in a droll and characteristic      fashion which delighted his Pacific admirers, and insured him a      crowded house.--[See Mark Twain: A Biography, chap  xlvi, and      Appendix H.]</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> His agreement had been to deliver his MS. about August 1st.

Then, through young Charles Langdon, his Quaker City shipmate, he      was invited to Elmira.  The invitation was given for a week, but      through a subterfuge--unpremeditated, and certainly fair enough in      a matter of love-he was enabled to considerably prolong his visit.      By the end of his stay he had become really &quot;like one of the      family,&quot; though certainly not yet accepted as such.  The fragmentary      letter that follows reflects something of his pleasant situation.      The Mrs. Fairbanks mentioned in this letter had been something more      than a &quot;shipmother&quot; to Mark Twain.  She was a woman of fine literary      taste, and Quaker City correspondent for her husband&#x27;s paper, the      Cleveland Herald.  She had given Mark Twain sound advice as to his      letters, which he had usually read to her, and had in no small      degree modified his early natural tendency to exaggeration and      outlandish humor.  He owed her much, and never failed to pay her      tribute.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Part of a letter to Mrs. Jane Clemens and family, in St. Louis:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                               ELMIRA, N.Y.

I thought I was getting ahead of her little assessments of $35 a month, but find I am falling behind with her instead, and have let her go without money.  Well, I did not mean to do it.  But you see when people have been getting ready for months in a quiet way to get married, they are bound to grow stingy, and go to saving up money against that awful day when it is sure to be needed.  I am particularly anxious to place myself in a position where I can carry on my married life in good shape on my own hook, because I have paddled my own canoe so long that I could not be satisfied now to let anybody help me--and my proposed father-in-law is naturally so liberal that it would be just like him to want to give us a start in life.  But I don&#x27;t want it that way.  I can start myself.  I don&#x27;t want any help.  I can run this institution without any outside assistance, and I shall have a wife who will stand by me like a soldier through thick and thin, and never complain.  She is only a little body, but she hasn&#x27;t her peer in Christendom.  I gave her only a plain gold engagement ring, when fashion imperatively demands a two-hundred dollar diamond one, and told her it was typical of her future lot--namely, that she would have to flourish on substantials rather than luxuries.  (But you see I know the girl--she don&#x27;t care anything about luxuries.) She is a splendid girl.  She spends no money but her usual year&#x27;s allowance, and she spends nearly every cent of that on other people.  She will be a good sensible little wife, without any airs about her.  I don&#x27;t make intercession for her beforehand and ask you to love her, for there isn&#x27;t any use in that--you couldn&#x27;t help it if you were to try.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>I warn you that whoever comes within the fatal influence of her beautiful nature is her willing slave for evermore.  I take my affidavit on that statement.  Her father and mother and brother embrace and pet her constantly, precisely as if she were a sweetheart, instead of a blood relation.  She has unlimited power over her father, and yet she never uses it except to make him help people who stand in need of help....</p>

<p>In twelve months (or rather I believe it is fourteen,) I have earned just eighty dollars by my pen--two little magazine squibs and one newspaper letter--altogether the idlest, laziest 14 months I ever spent in my life. And in that time my absolute and necessary expenses have been scorchingly heavy--for I have now less than three thousand six hundred dollars in bank out of the eight or nine thousand I have made during those months, lecturing.  My expenses were something frightful during the winter. I feel ashamed of my idleness, and yet I have had really no inclination to do anything but court Livy.  I haven&#x27;t any other inclination yet. I have determined not to work as hard traveling, any more, as I did last winter, and so I have resolved not to lecture outside of the 6 New England States next winter.  My Western course would easily amount to $10,000, but I would rather make 2 or 3 thousand in New England than submit again to so much wearing travel.  (I have promised to talk ten nights for a thousand dollars in the State of New York, provided the places are close together.) But after all if I get located in a newspaper in a way to suit me, in the meantime, I don&#x27;t want to lecture at all next winter, and probably shan&#x27;t.  I most cordially hate the lecture field. And after all, I shudder to think that I may never get out of it.</p>
<p>In all conversations with Gough, and Anna Dickinson, Nasby, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Wendell Phillips and the other old stagers, I could not observe that they ever expected or hoped to get out of the business. I don&#x27;t want to get wedded to it as they are.  Livy thinks we can live on a very moderate sum and that we&#x27;ll not need to lecture.  I know very well that she can live on a small allowance, but I am not so sure about myself.  I can&#x27;t scare her by reminding her that her father&#x27;s family expenses are forty thousand dollars a year, because she produces the documents at once to show that precious little of this outlay is on her account.  But I must not commence writing about Livy, else I shall never stop.  There isn&#x27;t such another little piece of perfection in the world as she is.</p>
<p>My time is become so short, now, that I doubt if I get to California this summer.  If I manage to buy into a paper, I think I will visit you a while and not go to Cal. at all.  I shall know something about it after my next trip to Hartford.  We all go there on the l0th--the whole family --to attend a wedding, on the 17th.  I am offered an interest in a Cleveland paper which would pay me $2,300 to $2,500 a year, and a salary added of $3,000.  The salary is fair enough, but the interest is not large enough, and so I must look a little further.  The Cleveland folks say they can be induced to do a little better by me, and urge me to come out and talk business.  But it don&#x27;t strike me--I feel little or no inclination to go.</p>
<p>I believe I haven&#x27;t anything else to write, and it is bed-time.  I want to write to Orion, but I keep putting it off--I keep putting everything off.  Day after day Livy and I are together all day long and until 10 at night, and then I feel dreadfully sleepy.  If Orion will bear with me and forgive me I will square up with him yet.  I will even let him kiss Livy.</p>
<p>My love to Mollie and Annie and Sammie and all.  Good-bye.                               Affectionately,                                                   SAM.</p>

<p>I have bundled up Livy&#x27;s picture and will try and recollect to mail it tomorrow.  It is a porcelaintype and I think you will like it.</p>
<p>I am sorry I never got to St. Louis, because I may be too busy to go, for a long time.  But I have been busy all the time and St. Louis is clear out of the way, and remote from the world and all ordinary routes of travel.  You must not place too much weight upon this idea of moving the capital from Washington.  St. Louis is in some respects a better place for it than Washington, though there isn&#x27;t more than a toss-up between the two after all.  One is dead and the other in a trance.  Washington is in the centre of population and business, while St. Louis is far removed from both.  And you know there is no geographical centre any more.  The railroads and telegraph have done away with all that.  It is no longer a matter of sufficient importance to be gravely considered by thinking men.  The only centres, now, are narrowed down to those of intelligence, capital and population. As I said before Washington is the nearest to those and you don&#x27;t have to paddle across a river on ferry boats of a pattern popular in the dark ages to get to it, nor have to clamber up vilely paved hills in rascally omnibuses along with a herd of all sorts of people after you are there. Secondly, the removal of the capital is one of those old, regular, reliable dodges that are the bread-and meat of back country congressmen.  It is agitated every year.  It always has been, it always will be; It is not new in any respect.  Thirdly.  The Capitol has cost $40,000,000 already and lacks a good deal of being finished, yet.  There are single stones in the Treasury building (and a good many of them) that cost twenty-seven thousand dollars apiece--and millions were spent in the construction of that and the Patent Office and the other great government buildings.  To move to St. Louis, the country must throw away a hundred millions of capital invested in those buildings, and go right to work to spend a hundred millions on new buildings in St. Louis.  Shall we ever have a Congress, a majority of whose members are hopelessly insane?  Probably not.  But it is possible- unquestionably such a thing is possible.  Only I don&#x27;t believe it will happen in our time; and I am satisfied the capital will not be moved until it does happen.  But if St. Louis would donate the ground and the buildings, it would be a different matter.  No, Pamela, I don&#x27;t see any good reason to believe you or I will ever see the capital moved.</p>
<p>I have twice instructed the publishers to send you a book--it was the first thing I did--long before the proofs were finished.  Write me if it is not yet done.</p>
<p>Livy says we must have you all at our marriage, and I say we can&#x27;t. It will be at Christmas or New Years, when such a trip across the country would be equivalent to murder &amp; arson &amp; everything else. --And it would cost five hundred dollars--an amount of money she don&#x27;t know the value of now, but will before a year is gone.  She grieves over it, poor little rascal, but it can&#x27;t be helped.  She must wait awhile, till I am firmly on my legs, &amp; then she shall see you.  She says her father and mother will invite you just as soon as the wedding date is definitely fixed, anyway--&amp; she thinks that&#x27;s bound to settle it.  But the ice &amp; snow, &amp; the long hard journey, &amp; the injudiciousness of laying out any money except what we are obliged to part with while we are so much in debt, settles the case differently.  For it is a debt.</p>
<p>.....Mr. Langdon is just as good as bound for $25,000 for me, and has already advanced half of it in cash.  I wrote and asked whether I had better send him my note, or a due-bill, or how he would prefer to have the indebtedness made of record and he answered every other topic in the letter pleasantly but never replied to that at all.  Still, I shall give my note into the hands of his business agent here, and pay him the interest as it falls due.  We must &quot;go slow.&quot;  We are not in the Cleveland Herald.  We are a hundred thousand times better off, but there isn&#x27;t so much money in it.</p>

I regret this very much, for there are several among you whom I would have a right to join hands with on the score of old friendship, and I suppose I would have a sublime general right to shake hands with the rest of you on the score of kinship in California ups and downs in search of fortune.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>If I were to tell some of my experience, you would recognize California blood in me; I fancy the old, old story would sound familiar, no doubt. I have the usual stock of reminiscences.  For instance: I went to Esmeralda early.  I purchased largely in the &quot;Wide West,&quot;  &quot;Winnemucca,&quot; and other fine claims, and was very wealthy.  I fared sumptuously on bread when flour was $200 a barrel and had beans for dinner every Sunday, when none but bloated aristocrats could afford such grandeur.  But I finished by feeding batteries in a quartz mill at $15 a week, and wishing I was a battery myself and had somebody to feed me.  My claims in Esmeralda are there yet.  I suppose I could be persuaded to sell.</p>
<p>I went to Humboldt District when it was new; I became largely interested in the &quot;Alba Nueva&quot; and other claims with gorgeous names, and was rich again--in prospect.  I owned a vast mining property there.  I would not have sold out for less than $400,000 at that time.  But I will now. Finally I walked home--200 miles partly for exercise, and partly because stage fare was expensive.  Next I entered upon an affluent career in Virginia City, and by a judicious investment of labor and the capital of friends, became the owner of about all the worthless wild cat mines there were in that part of the country.  Assessments did the business for me there.  There were a hundred and seventeen assessments to one dividend, and the proportion of income to outlay was a little against me.  My financial barometer went down to 32 Fahrenheit, and the subscriber was frozen out.</p>
<p>I took up extensions on the main lead-extensions that reached to British America, in one direction, and to the Isthmus of Panama in the other--and I verily believe I would have been a rich man if I had ever found those infernal extensions.  But I didn&#x27;t.  I ran tunnels till I tapped the Arctic Ocean, and I sunk shafts till I broke through the roof of perdition; but those extensions turned up missing every time.  I am willing to sell all that property and throw in the improvements.</p>
<p>Perhaps you remember that celebrated &quot;North Ophir?&quot;  I bought that mine. It was very rich in pure silver.  You could take it out in lumps as large as a filbert.  But when it was discovered that those lumps were melted half dollars, and hardly melted at that, a painful case of &quot;salting&quot; was apparent, and the undersigned adjourned to the poorhouse again.</p>
<p>I paid assessments on &quot;Hale and Norcross&quot; until they sold me out, and I had to take in washing for a living--and the next month that infamous stock went up to $7,000 a foot.</p>
<p>I own millions and millions of feet of affluent silver leads in Nevada-- in fact the entire undercrust of that country nearly, and if Congress would move that State off my property so that I could get at it, I would be wealthy yet.  But no, there she squats--and here am I.  Failing health persuades me to sell.  If you know of any one desiring a permanent investment, I can furnish one that will have the virtue of being eternal.</p>
<p>I have been through the California mill, with all its &quot;dips, spurs and angles, variations and sinuosities.&quot;  I have worked there at all the different trades and professions known to the catalogues.  I have been everything, from a newspaper editor down to a cow-catcher on a locomotive, and I am encouraged to believe that if there had been a few more occupations to experiment on, I might have made a dazzling success at last, and found out what mysterious designs Providence had in creating me.</p>
<p>But you perceive that although I am not a Pioneer, I have had a sufficiently variegated time of it to enable me to talk Pioneer like a native, and feel like a Forty-Niner.  Therefore, I cordially welcome you to your old-remembered homes and your long deserted firesides, and close this screed with the sincere hope that your visit here will be a happy one, and not embittered by the sorrowful surprises that absence and lapse of years are wont to prepare for wanderers; surprises which come in the form of old friends missed from their places; silence where familiar voices should be; the young grown old; change and decay everywhere; home a delusion and a disappointment; strangers at hearthstone; sorrow where gladness was; tears for laughter; the melancholy-pomp of death where the grace of life has been!</p>
<p>With all good wishes for the Returned Prodigals, and regrets that I cannot partake of a small piece of the fatted calf (rare and no gravy,)                          I am yours, cordially,                                         MARK TWAIN.</p>

It was the price of his success      and popularity, combined with his general gift for being concerned      with a number of things, and a natural tendency for getting into hot      water, which becomes more evident as the years and letters pass in      review.  Orion Clemens, in his attempt to save money for the      government, had employed methods and agents which the officials at      Washington did not understand, and refused to recognize.  Instead of      winning the credit and commendation he had expected, he now found      himself pursued by claims of considerable proportions.  The &quot;land&quot;      referred to is the Tennessee tract, the heritage which John Clemens      had provided for his children.  Mark Twain had long since lost faith      in it, and was not only willing, but eager to renounce his rights.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Nasby&quot; is, of course, David R.  Locke, of the Toledo Blade, whose      popularity at this time both as a lecturer and writer was very      great.  Clemens had met him here and there on their platform tour,      and they had become good friends.  Clemens, in fact, had once      proposed to Nasby a joint trip to the Pacific coast.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The California idea had been given up, but both Mark Twain and Nasby      found engagements enough, and sufficient profit east of the      Mississippi.  Boston was often their headquarters that winter (&#x27;69      and &#x27;70), and they were much together.  &quot;Josh Billings,&quot; another of      Redpath&#x27;s lecturers, was likewise often to be found in the Lyceum      offices.  There is a photograph of Mark Twain, Nasby, and Josh      Billings together.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Clemens also, that winter, met William Dean Howells, then in the      early days of his association with the Atlantic Monthly.  The two      men, so widely different, became firm friends at sight, and it was      to Howells in the years to come that Mark Twain would write more      letters, and more characteristic letters, than to any other living      man.  Howells had favorably reviewed &#x27;The Innocents Abroad,&#x27; and      after the first moment of their introduction had passed Clemens      said: &quot;When I read that review of yours I felt like the woman who      said that she was so glad that her baby had come white.&quot;  It was not      the sort of thing that Howells would have said, but it was the sort      of thing that he could understand and appreciate from Mark Twain.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> In company with Nasby Clemens, that season, also met Oliver Wendell      Holmes.  Later he had sent Holmes a copy of his book and received a      pleasantly appreciative reply.  &quot;I always like,&quot; wrote Holmes, &quot;to      hear what one of my fellow countrymen, who is not a Hebrew scholar,      or a reader of hiero-glyphics, but a good-humored traveler with a      pair of sharp, twinkling Yankee (in the broader sense) eyes in his      head, has to say about the things that learned travelers often make      unintelligible, and sentimental ones ridiculous or absurd ....  I      hope your booksellers will sell a hundred thousand copies of your      travels.&quot;  A wish that was realized in due time, though it is      doubtful if Doctor Holmes or any one else at the moment believed      that a book of that nature and price (it was $3.50 a copy) would      ever reach such a sale.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                  To Mrs. Moffett, in St. Louis:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                                              BOSTON, Nov. 9, 1869. MY DEAR SISTER,--Three or four letters just received from home.  My first impulse was to send Orion a check on my publisher for the money he wants, but a sober second thought suggested that if he has not defrauded the government out of money, why pay, simply because the government chooses to consider him in its debt?  No: Right is right.  The idea don&#x27;t suit me.  Let him write the Treasury the state of the case, and tell them he has no money.  If they make his sureties pay, then I will make the sureties whole, but I won&#x27;t pay a cent of an unjust claim.  You talk of disgrace.  To my mind it would be just as disgraceful to allow one&#x27;s self to be bullied into paying that which is unjust.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>Ma thinks it is hard that Orion&#x27;s share of the land should be swept away just as it is right on the point (as it always has been) of becoming valuable.  Let her rest easy on that point.  This letter is his ample authority to sell my share of the land immediately and appropriate the proceeds--giving no account to me, but repaying the amount to Ma first, or in case of her death, to you or your heirs, whenever in the future he shall be able to do it.  Now, I want no hesitation in this matter.  I renounce my ownership from this date, for this purpose, provided it is sold just as suddenly as he can sell it.</p>
<p>In the next place--Mr. Langdon is old, and is trying hard to withdraw from business and seek repose.  I will not burden him with a purchase-- but I will ask him to take full possession of a coal tract of the land without paying a cent, simply conditioning that he shall mine and throw the coal into market at his own cost, and pay to you and all of you what he thinks is a fair portion of the profits accruing--you can do as you please with the rest of the land.  Therefore, send me (to Elmira,) information about the coal deposits so framed that he can comprehend the matter and can intelligently instruct an agent how to find it and go to work.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night I appear for the first time before a Boston audience-- 4,000 critics--and on the success of this matter depends my future success in New England.  But I am not distressed.  Nasby is in the same boat.  Tonight decides the fate of his brand-new lecture.  He has just left my room--been reading his lecture to me--was greatly depressed.  I have convinced him that he has little to fear.</p>
<p>I get just about five hundred more applications to lecture than I can possibly fill--and in the West they say &quot;Charge all you please, but come.&quot;  I shan&#x27;t go West at all.  I stop lecturing the 22d of January, sure.  But I shall talk every night up to that time.  They flood me with high-priced invitations to write for magazines and papers, and publishers besiege me to write books.  Can&#x27;t do any of these things.</p>
<p>I am twenty-two thousand dollars in debt, and shall earn the money and pay it within two years--and therefore I am not spending any money except when it is necessary.</p>
<p>I had my life insured for $10,000 yesterday (what ever became of Mr. Moffett&#x27; s life insurance?) &quot;for the benefit of my natural heirs&quot;--the same being my mother, for Livy wouldn&#x27;t claim it, you may be sure of that.  This has taken $200 out of my pocket which I was going to send to Ma.  But I will send her some, soon.  Tell Orion to keep a stiff upper lip--when the worst comes to the worst I will come forward.  Must talk in Providence, R. I., tonight.  Must leave now.  I thank Mollie and Orion and the rest for your letters, but you see how I am pushed--ought to have 6 clerks.                               Affectionately,                                                   SAM.</p>

<p>I think you are rushing this book in a manner to be proud of; and you will make the finest success of it that has ever been made with a subscription book, I believe.  What with advertising, establishing agencies, &amp;c., you have got an enormous lot of machinery under way and hard at work in a wonderfully short space of time.  It is easy to see, when one travels around, that one must be endowed with a deal of genuine generalship in order to maneuvre a publication whose line of battle stretches from end to end of a great continent, and whose foragers and skirmishers invest every hamlet and besiege every village hidden away in all the vast space between.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll back you against any publisher in America, Bliss--or elsewhere.                                         Yrs as ever                                                   CLEMENS.</p>

Still, it shouldn&#x27;t--for right in the depths of their poverty and their pocket-hunting vagabondage lay the germ of my coming good fortune. You remember the one gleam of jollity that shot across our dismal sojourn in the rain and mud of Angels&#x27; Camp I mean that day we sat around the tavern stove and heard that chap tell about the frog and how they filled him with shot.  And you remember how we quoted from the yarn and laughed over it, out there on the hillside while you and dear old Stoker panned and washed.  I jotted the story down in my note-book that day, and would have been glad to get ten or fifteen dollars for it--I was just that blind.  But then we were so hard up! I published that story, and it became widely known in America, India, China, England--and the reputation it made for me has paid me thousands and thousands of dollars since.  Four or five months ago I bought into the Express (I have ordered it sent to you as long as you live--and if the book keeper sends you any bills, you let me hear of it.)

<p>Mr. Langdon, whose hope is one of his most prominent characteristics, says himself, this morning, that his recovery is only a possibility, not a probability.  He made his will this morning--that is, appointed executors--nothing else was necessary.  The household is sad enough Charley is in Bavaria.  We telegraphed Munroe &amp; Co. Paris, to notify Charley to come home--they sent the message to Munich.  Our message left here at 8 in the morning and Charley&#x27;s answer arrived less than eight hours afterward.  He sailed immediately.</p>
<p>He will reach home two weeks from now.  The whole city is troubled.  As I write (at the office,) a dispatch arrives from Charley who has reached London, and will sail thence on 28th.  He wants news.  We cannot send him any.                          Affectionately                                         SAM.</p>

<p>I am not corpulent, nor am I robust in any way.  At birth I only weighed 4 ?pounds with my clothes on--and the clothes were the chief feature of the weight, too, I am obliged to confess.  But I am doing finely, all things considered.  I was at a standstill for 3 days and a half, but during the last 24 hours I have gained nearly an ounce, avoirdupois.</p>
<p>They all say I look very old and venerable-and I am aware, myself, that I never smile.  Life seems a serious thing, what I have seen of it--and my observation teaches me that it is made up mainly of hiccups, unnecessary washings, and colic.  But no doubt you, who are old, have long since grown accustomed and reconciled to what seems to me such a disagreeable novelty.</p>
<p>My father said, this morning, when my face was in repose and thoughtful, that I looked precisely as young Edward Twichell of Hartford used to look some is months ago--chin, mouth, forehead, expression--everything.</p>
<p>My little mother is very bright and cheery, and I guess she is pretty happy, but I don&#x27;t know what about.  She laughs a great deal, notwithstanding she is sick abed.  And she eats a great deal, though she says that is because the nurse desires it.  And when she has had all the nurse desires her to have, she asks for more.  She is getting along very well indeed.</p>
<p>My aunt Susie Crane has been here some ten days or two weeks, but goes home today, and Granny Fairbanks of Cleveland arrives to take her place. --[Mrs. Fairbanks, of the Quaker City excursion.]                                    Very lovingly,                                              LANGDON CLEMENS.</p>

<p>Livy is up, and the prince keeps her busy and anxious these latter days and nights, but I am a bachelor up stairs and don&#x27;t have to jump up and get the soothing syrup -though I would as soon do it as not, I assure you.  (Livy will be certain to read this letter.)</p>
<p>Tell Harmony (Mrs. T.) that I do hold the baby, and do it pretty handily, too, although with occasional apprehensions that his loose head will fall off.  I don&#x27;t have to quiet him--he hardly ever utters a cry.  He is always thinking about something.  He is a patient, good little baby.</p>
<p>Smoke?  I always smoke from 3 till 5 Sunday afternoons--and in New York the other day I smoked a week, day and night.  But when Livy is well I smoke only those two hours on Sunday.  I&#x27;m &quot;boss&quot; of the habit, now, and shall never let it boss me any more.  Originally, I quit solely on Livy&#x27;s account, (not that I believed there was the faintest reason in the matter, but just as I would deprive myself of sugar in my coffee if she wished it, or quit wearing socks if she thought them immoral,) and I stick to it yet on Livy&#x27;s account, and shall always continue to do so, without a pang.  But somehow it seems a pity that you quit, for Mrs. T. didn&#x27;t mind it if I remember rightly.  Ah, it is turning one&#x27;s back upon a kindly Providence to spurn away from us the good creature he sent to make the breath of life a luxury as well as a necessity, enjoyable as well as useful, to go and quit smoking when then ain&#x27;t any sufficient excuse for it!  Why, my old boy, when they use to tell me I would shorten my life ten years by smoking, they little knew the devotee they were wasting their puerile word upon--they little knew how trivial and valueless I would regard a decade that had no smoking in it!  But I won&#x27;t persuade you, Twichell--I won&#x27;t until I see you again--but then we&#x27;ll smoke for a week together, and then shut off again.</p>
<p>I would have gone to Hartford from New York last Saturday, but I got so homesick I couldn&#x27;t.  But maybe I&#x27;ll come soon.</p>

When Bret Harte&#x27;s &quot;Heathen Chinee&quot; devastated the      country, and was so widely parodied, an imitation of it entitled,      &quot;Three Aces,&quot; and signed &quot;Carl Byng,&quot; was printed in the Express.      Thomas Bailey Aldrich, then editor of Every Saturday, had not met      Mark Twain, and, noticing the verses printed in the exchanges over      his signature, was one of those who accepted them as Mark Twain&#x27;s      work.  He wrote rather an uncomplimentary note in Every Saturday      concerning the poem and its authorship, characterizing it as a      feeble imitation of Bret Harte&#x27;s &quot;Heathen Chinee.&quot;  Clemens promptly      protested to Aldrich, then as promptly regretted having done so,      feeling that he was making too much of a small matter.

<p>I hear a good deal about doing things on the &quot;spur of the moment&quot;-- I invariably regret the things I do on the spur of the moment.  That disclaimer of mine was a case in point.  I am ashamed every time I think of my bursting out before an unconcerned public with that bombastic pow- wow about burning publishers&#x27; letters, and all that sort of imbecility, and about my not being an imitator, etc.  Who would find out that I am a natural fool if I kept always cool and never let nature come to the surface?  Nobody.</p>
<p>But I did hate to be accused of plagiarizing Bret Harte, who trimmed and trained and schooled me patiently until he changed me from an awkward utterer of coarse grotesquenesses to a writer of paragraphs and chapters that have found a certain favor in the eyes of even some of the very decentest people in the land--and this grateful remembrance of mine ought to be worth its face, seeing that Bret broke our long friendship a year ago without any cause or provocation that I am aware of.</p>
<p>Well, it is funny, the reminiscences that glare out from murky corners of one&#x27;s memory, now and then, without warning.  Just at this moment a picture flits before me: Scene--private room in Barnum&#x27;s Restaurant, Virginia, Nevada; present, Artemus Ward, Joseph T.  Goodman, (editor and proprietor Daily &quot;Enterprise&quot;), and &quot;Dan de Quille&quot; and myself, reporters for same; remnants of the feast thin and scattering, but such tautology and repetition of empty bottles everywhere visible as to be offensive to the sensitive eye; time, 2.30 A.M.; Artemus thickly reciting a poem about a certain infant you wot of, and interrupting himself and being interrupted every few lines by poundings of the table and shouts of &quot;Splendid, by Shorzhe!&quot;  Finally, a long, vociferous, poundiferous and vitreous jingling of applause announces the conclusion, and then Artemus: &quot;Let every man &#x27;at loves his fellow man and &#x27;preciates a poet &#x27;at loves his fellow man, stan&#x27; up!--Stan&#x27; up and drink health and long life to Thomas Bailey Aldrich!--and drink it stanning!&quot; (On all hands fervent, enthusiastic, and sincerely honest attempts to comply.) Then Artemus: &quot;Well--consider it stanning, and drink it just as ye are!&quot;  Which was done.</p>
<p>You must excuse all this stuff from a stranger, for the present, and when I see you I will apologize in full.</p>
<p>Do you know the prettiest fancy and the neatest that ever shot through Harte&#x27;s brain?  It was this:  When they were trying to decide upon a vignette for the cover of the Overland, a grizzly bear (of the arms of the State of California) was chosen.  Nahl Bras. carved him and the page was printed, with him in it, looking thus: [Rude sketch of a grizzly bear.]</p>
<p>As a bear, he was a success--he was a good bear--.  But then, it was objected, that he was an objectless bear--a bear that meant nothing in particular, signified nothing,--simply stood there snarling over his shoulder at nothing--and was painfully and manifestly a boorish and ill- natured intruder upon the fair page.  All hands said that--none were satisfied.  They hated badly to give him up, and yet they hated as much to have him there when there was no paint to him.  But presently Harte took a pencil and drew these two simple lines under his feet and behold he was a magnificent success!--the ancient symbol of California savagery snarling at the approaching type of high and progressive Civilization, the first Overland locomotive!: [Sketch of a small section of railway track.]</p>
<p>I just think that was nothing less than inspiration itself.</p>

MY DEAR BRO,--What I wanted of the &quot;Liar&quot; Sketch, was to work it into the California book--which I shall do.  But day before yesterday I concluded to go out of the Galaxy on the strength of it, so I have turned it into the last Memoranda I shall ever write, and published it as a &quot;specimen chapter&quot; of my forthcoming book.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>I have written the Galaxy people that I will never furnish them another article long or short, for any price but $500.00 cash--and have requested them not to ask me for contributions any more, even at that price.</p>
<p>I hope that lets them out, for I will stick to that.  Now do try and leave me clear out of the &#x27;Publisher&#x27; for the present, for I am endangering my reputation by writing too much--I want to get out of the public view for awhile.</p>
<p>I am still nursing Livy night and day and cannot write anything.  I am nearly worn out.  We shall go to Elmira ten days hence (if Livy can travel on a mattress then,) and stay there till I have finished the California book--say three months.  But I can&#x27;t begin work right away when I get there--must have a week&#x27;s rest, for I have been through 30 days&#x27; terrific siege.</p>
<p>That makes it after the middle of March before I can go fairly to work-- and then I&#x27;ll have to hump myself and not lose a moment.  You and Bliss just put yourselves in my place and you will see that my hands are full and more than full.</p>
<p>When I told Bliss in N. Y. that I would write something for the Publisher I could not know that I was just about to lose fifty days.  Do you see the difference it makes?  Just as soon as ever I can, I will send some of the book M.S. but right in the first chapter I have got to alter the whole style of one of my characters and re-write him clear through to where I am now.  It is no fool of a job, I can tell you, but the book will be greatly bettered by it.  Hold on a few days--four or five--and I will see if I can get a few chapters fixed to send to Bliss.</p>
<p>I have offered this dwelling house and the Express for sale, and when we go to Elmira we leave here for good.  I shall not select a new home till the book is finished, but we have little doubt that Hartford will be the place.</p>
<p>We are almost certain of that.  Ask Bliss how it would be to ship our furniture to Hartford, rent an upper room in a building and unbox it and store it there where somebody can frequently look after it.  Is not the idea good?  The furniture is worth $10,000 or $12,000 and must not be jammed into any kind of a place and left unattended to for a year.</p>
<p>The first man that offers $25,000 for our house can take it--it cost that.  What are taxes there?  Here, all bunched together--of all kinds, they are 7 per cent--simply ruin.</p>
<p>The things you have written in the Publisher are tip-top.                          In haste,                                    Yr Bro                                              SAM</p>

Clemens had sold his interest in the      Express (though at a loss), had severed his magazine connection, and      was located at Quarry Farm, on a beautiful hilltop above Elmira, the      home of Mrs. Clemens&#x27;s sister, Mrs. Theodore Crane.  The pure air      and rest of that happy place, where they were to spend so many      idyllic summers, had proved beneficial to the sick ones, and work on      the new book progressed in consequence.  Then Mark Twain&#x27;s old      editor, &quot;Joe&quot; Goodman, came from Virginia City for a visit, and his      advice and encouragement were of the greatest value.  Clemens even      offered to engage Goodman on a salary, to remain until he had      finished his book.  Goodman declined the salary, but extended his      visit, and Mark Twain at last seems to have found himself working      under ideal conditions.  He jubilantly reports his progress.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                  To Elisha Bliss, in Hartford:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                               ELMIRA, Monday.

<p>I have MS. enough on hand now, to make (allowing for engravings) about 400 pages of the book--consequently am two-thirds done.  I intended to run up to Hartford about the middle of the week and take it along; because it has chapters in it that ought by all means to be in the prospectus; but I find myself so thoroughly interested in my work, now (a thing I have not experienced for months) that I can&#x27;t bear to lose a single moment of the inspiration.  So I will stay here and peg away as long as it lasts.  My present idea is to write as much more as I have already written, and then cull from the mass the very best chapters and discard the rest.  I am not half as well satisfied with the first part of the book as I am with what I am writing now.  When I get it done I want to see the man who will begin to read it and not finish it.  If it falls short of the &quot;Innocents&quot; in any respect I shall lose my guess.</p>
<p>When I was writing the &quot;Innocents&quot; my daily stunt was 30 pages of MS and I hardly ever got beyond it; but I have gone over that nearly every day for the last ten.  That shows that I am writing with a red-hot interest. Nothing grieves me now--nothing troubles me, nothing bothers me or gets my attention--I don&#x27;t think of anything but the book, and I don&#x27;t have an hour&#x27;s unhappiness about anything and don&#x27;t care two cents whether school keeps or not.  It will be a bully book.  If I keep up my present lick three weeks more I shall be able and willing to scratch out half of the chapters of the Overland narrative--and shall do it.</p>
<p>You do not mention having received my second batch of MS, sent a week or two ago--about 100 pages.</p>
<p>If you want to issue a prospectus and go right to canvassing, say the word and I will forward some more MS--or send it by hand--special messenger.  Whatever chapters you think are unquestionably good, we will retain of course, so they can go into a prospectus as well one time as another.  The book will be done soon, now.  I have 1200 pages of MS already written and am now writing 200 a week--more than that, in fact; during the past week wrote 23 one day, then 30, 33, 35, 52, and 65. --How&#x27;s that?</p>
<p>It will be a starchy book, and should be full of snappy pictures-- especially pictures worked in with the letterpress.  The dedication will be worth the price of the volume--thus:</p>

<p>Not on account of respect for his memory, for it merits little respect; not on account of sympathy with him, for his bloody deed placed him without the pale of sympathy, strictly speaking: but out of a mere human commiseration for him that it was his misfortune to live in a dark age that knew not the beneficent Insanity Plea.</p>

DEAR RED,--I am different from other women; my mind changes oftener. People who have no mind can easily be steadfast and firm, but when a man is loaded down to the guards with it, as I am, every heavy sea of foreboding or inclination, maybe of indolence, shifts the cargo.  See? Therefore, if you will notice, one week I am likely to give rigid instructions to confine me to New England; next week, send me to Arizona; the next week withdraw my name; the next week give you full untrammelled swing; and the week following modify it.  You must try to keep the run of my mind, Redpath, it is your business being the agent, and it always was too many for me.  It appears to me to be one of the finest pieces of mechanism I have ever met with.  Now about the West, this week, I am willing that you shall retain all the Western engagements.  But what I shall want next week is still with God.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

He did not fail to      return to the company of Nasby, Josh Billings, and those others of      Redpath&#x27;s &quot;attractions&quot; as long and as often as distance would      permit.  Bret Harte, who by this time had won fame, was also in      Boston now, and frequently, with Howells, Aldrich, and Mark Twain,      gathered in some quiet restaurant corner for a luncheon that lasted      through a dim winter afternoon--a period of anecdote, reminiscence,      and mirth.  They were all young then, and laughed easily.  Howells,      has written of one such luncheon given by Ralph Keeler, a young      Californian--a gathering at which James T. Fields was present      &quot;Nothing remains to me of the happy time but a sense of idle and      aimless and joyful talk-play, beginning and ending nowhere, of eager      laughter, of countless good stories from Fields, of a heat-lightning      shimmer of wit from Aldrich, of an occasional concentration of our      joint mockeries upon our host, who took it gladly.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But a lecture circuit cannot be restricted to the radius of Boston.

FRIEND HOWELLS,--Could you tell me how I could get a copy of your portrait as published in Hearth and Home?  I hear so much talk about it as being among the finest works of art which have yet appeared in that journal, that I feel a strong desire to see it.  Is it suitable for framing?  I have written the publishers of H &amp; H time and again, but they say that the demand for the portrait immediately exhausted the edition and now a copy cannot be had, even for the European demand, which has now begun.  Bret Harte has been here, and says his family would not be without that portrait for any consideration.  He says his children get up in the night and yell for it.  I would give anything for a copy of that portrait to put up in my parlor.  I have Oliver Wendell Holmes and Bret Harte&#x27;s, as published in Every Saturday, and of all the swarms that come every day to gaze upon them none go away that are not softened and humbled and made more resigned to the will of God.  If I had yours to put up alongside of them, I believe the combination would bring more souls to earnest reflection and ultimate conviction of their lost condition, than any other kind of warning would.  Where in the nation can I get that portrait?  Here are heaps of people that want it,--that need it.  There is my uncle.  He wants a copy.  He is lying at the point of death.  He has been lying at the point of death for two years.  He wants a copy--and I want him to have a copy.  And I want you to send a copy to the man that shot my dog.

<p>But what I wish to put on record now, is my new invention--hence this note, which you will preserve.  It is this--a self-pasting scrap-book --good enough idea if some juggling tailor does not come along and ante- date me a couple of months, as in the case of the elastic veststrap.</p>
<p>The nuisance of keeping a scrap-book is:  1.  One never has paste or gum tragacanth handy;  2.  Mucilage won&#x27;t stick, or stay, 4 weeks; 3.  Mucilage sucks out the ink and makes the scraps unreadable; 4.  To daub and paste 3 or 4 pages of scraps is tedious, slow, nasty and tiresome.  My idea is this: Make a scrap-book with leaves veneered or coated with gum-stickum of some kind; wet the page with sponge, brush, rag or tongue, and dab on your scraps like postage stamps.</p>
<p>Lay on the gum in columns of stripes.</p>
<p>Each stripe of gum the length of say 20 ems, small pica, and as broad as your finger; a blank about as broad as your finger between each 2 stripes--so in wetting the paper you need not wet any more of the gum than your scrap or scraps will cover--then you may shut up the book and the leaves won&#x27;t stick together.</p>
<p>Preserve, also, the envelope of this letter--postmark ought to be good evidence of the date of this great humanizing and civilizing invention.</p>

<p>LETTERS 1872-73.  MARK TWAIN IN ENGLAND.  LONDON HONORS.  ACQUAINTANCE WITH DR. JOHN BROWN.  A LECTURE TRIUMPH.  &quot;THE GILDED AGE&quot;</p>

All literary London joined in giving him a      good time.  He had not as yet been received seriously by the older      American men of letters, but England made no question as to his      title to first rank.  Already, too, they classified him as of the      human type of Lincoln, and reveled in him without stint.  Howells      writes: &quot;In England, rank, fashion, and culture rejoiced in him.      Lord Mayors, Lord Chief justices, and magnates of many kinds were      his hosts.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He was treated so well and enjoyed it all so much that he could not      write a book--the kind of book he had planned.  One could not poke      fun at a country or a people that had welcomed him with open arms.      He made plenty of notes, at first, but presently gave up the book      idea and devoted himself altogether to having a good time.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He had one grievance--a publisher by the name of Hotten, a sort of      literary harpy, of which there were a great number in those days of      defective copyright, not merely content with pilfering his early      work, had reprinted, under the name of Mark Twain, the work of a      mixed assortment of other humorists, an offensive volume bearing the      title, Screamers and Eye-openers, by Mark Twain.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They besieged him to lecture in London, and promised him overflowing      houses.  Artemus Ward, during his last days, had earned London by      storm with his platform humor, and they promised Mark Twain even      greater success.  For some reason, however, he did not welcome the      idea; perhaps there was too much gaiety.

<p>There is too much sociability--I do not get along fast enough with work. Tomorrow I lunch with Mr. Toole and a Member of Parliament--Toole is the most able Comedian of the day.  And then I am done for a while.  On Tuesday I mean to hang a card to my keybox, inscribed--&quot;Gone out of the City for a week&quot;--and then I shall go to work and work hard.  One can&#x27;t be caught in a hive of 4,000,000 people, like this.</p>
<p>I have got such a perfectly delightful razor.  I have a notion to buy some for Charley, Theodore and Slee--for I know they have no such razors there.  I have got a neat little watch-chain for Annie--$20.</p>

<p>Yes, it is true.  I am only going to remain beyond the sea, six months, that is all.  I love stir and excitement; and so the moment the spring birds begin to sing, and the lagging weariness of summer to threaten, I grow restless, I get the fidgets; I want to pack off somewhere where there&#x27;s something going on.  But you know how that is--you must have felt that way.  This very day I saw the signs in the air of the coming dullness, and I said to myself, &quot;How glad I am that I have already chartered a steamship!&quot;  There was absolutely nothing in the morning papers.  You can see for yourself what the telegraphic headings were:</p>

<p>The items under those headings all bear date yesterday, Apl. 16 (refer to your own paper)--and I give you my word of honor that that string of commonplace stuff was everything there was in the telegraphic columns that a body could call news.  Well, said I to myself this is getting pretty dull; this is getting pretty dry; there don&#x27;t appear to be anything going on anywhere; has this progressive nation gone to sleep? Have I got to stand another month of this torpidity before I can begin to browse among the lively capitals of Europe?</p>
<p>But never mind-things may revive while I am away.  During the last two months my next-door neighbor, Chas. Dudley Warner, has dropped his &quot;Back- Log Studies,&quot; and he and I have written a bulky novel in partnership. He has worked up the fiction and I have hurled in the facts.  I consider it one of the most astonishing novels that ever was written.  Night after night I sit up reading it over and over again and crying.  It will be published early in the Fall, with plenty of pictures.  Do you consider this an advertisement?--and if so, do you charge for such things when a man is your friend?

A man named Chew related to Twichell a most      entertaining occurrence.  Twichell saw great possibilities in it,      and suggested that Mark Twain be allowed to make a story of it,      sharing the profits with Chew.  Chew agreed, and promised to send      the facts, carefully set down.  Twichell, in the mean time, told the      story to Clemens, who was delighted with it and strongly tempted to      write it at once, while he was in the spirit, without waiting on      Chew.  Fortunately, he did not do so, for when Chew&#x27;s material came      it was in the form of a clipping, the story having been already      printed in some newspaper.  Chew&#x27;s knowledge of literary ethics      would seem to have been slight.  He thought himself entitled to      something under the agreement with Twichell.  Mark Twain, by this      time in London, naturally had a different opinion.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">               To Rev.

DEAR OLD JOE,--I consider myself wholly at liberty to decline to pay Chew anything, and at the same time strongly tempted to sue him into the bargain for coming so near ruining me.  If he hadn&#x27;t happened to send me that thing in print, I would have used the story (like an innocent fool) and would straightway have been hounded to death as a plagiarist.  It would have absolutely destroyed me. I cannot conceive of a man being such a hopeless ass (after serving as a legislative reporter, too) as to imagine that I or any other literary man in his senses would consent to chew over old stuff that had already been in print.  If that man wern&#x27;t an infant in swaddling clothes, his only reply to our petition would have been, &quot;It has been in print.&quot;  It makes me as mad as the very Old Harry every time I think of Mr. Chew and the frightfully narrow escape I have had at his hands.  Confound Mr. Chew, with all my heart!  I&#x27;m willing that he should have ten dollars for his trouble of warming over his cold victuals--cheerfully willing to that--but no more.  If I had had him near when his letter came, I would have got out my tomahawk and gone for him.

<p>For the present we shall remain in this queer old walled town, with its crooked, narrow lanes, that tell us of their old day that knew no wheeled vehicles; its plaster-and-timber dwellings, with upper stories far overhanging the street, and thus marking their date, say three hundred years ago; the stately city walls, the castellated gates, the ivy-grown, foliage-sheltered, most noble and picturesque ruin of St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey, suggesting their date, say five hundred years ago, in the heart of Crusading times and the glory of English chivalry and romance; the vast Cathedral of York, with its worn carvings and quaintly pictured windows, preaching of still remoter days; the outlandish names of streets and courts and byways that stand as a record and a memorial, all these centuries, of Danish dominion here in still earlier times; the hint here and there of King Arthur and his knights and their bloody fights with Saxon oppressors round about this old city more than thirteen hundred years gone by; and, last of all, the melancholy old stone coffins and sculptured inscriptions, a venerable arch and a hoary tower of stone that still remain and are kissed by the sun and caressed by the shadows every day, just as the sun and the shadows have kissed and caressed them every lagging day since the Roman Emperor&#x27;s soldiers placed them here in the times when Jesus the Son of Mary walked the streets of Nazareth a youth, with no more name or fame than the Yorkshire boy who is loitering down this street this moment.</p>

Dolby announced him to appear at the Queen&#x27;s      Concert Rooms, Hanover Square, for the week of October 13-18, his      lecture to be the old Sandwich Islands talk that seven years before      had brought him his first success.

<p>The first three days were stormy, and wife, child, maid, and Miss Spaulding were all sea-sick 25 hours out of the 24, and I was sorry I ever started.  However, it has been smooth, and balmy, and sunny and altogether lovely for a day or two now, and at night there is a broad luminous highway stretching over the sea to the moon, over which the spirits of the sea are traveling up and down all through the secret night and having a genuine good time, I make no doubt.</p>
<p>Today they discovered a &quot;collie&quot; on board!  I find (as per advertisement which I sent you) that they won&#x27;t carry dogs in these ships at any price. This one has been concealed up to this time.  Now his owner has to pay L10 or heave him overboard.  Fortunately the doggie is a performing doggie and the money will be paid.  So after all it was just as well you didn&#x27;t intrust your collie to us.</p>
<p>A poor little child died at midnight and was buried at dawn this morning --sheeted and shotted, and sunk in the middle of the lonely ocean in water three thousand fathoms deep.

However, I have a strong faith that it is not too late, yet, and that the judiciously managed influence of a bad example will fetch you back again.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>I wish you had written me some news--Livy tells me precious little.  She mainly writes to hurry me home and to tell me how much she respects me: but she&#x27;s generally pretty slow on news.  I had a letter from her along with yours, today, but she didn&#x27;t tell me the book is out.  However, it&#x27;s all right.  I hope to be home 20 days from today, and then I&#x27;ll see her, and that will make up for a whole year&#x27;s dearth of news.  I am right down grateful that she is looking strong and &quot;lovelier than ever.&quot;  I only wish I could see her look her level best, once--I think it would be a vision.</p>
<p>I have just spent a good part of this day browsing through the Royal Academy Exhibition of Landseer&#x27;s paintings.  They fill four or five great salons, and must number a good many hundreds.  This is the only opportunity ever to see them, because the finest of them belong to the queen and she keeps them in her private apartments.  Ah, they&#x27;re wonderfully beautiful!  There are such rich moonlights and dusks in &quot;The Challenge&quot; and &quot;The Combat;&quot; and in that long flight of birds across a lake in the subdued flush of sunset (or sunrise--for no man can ever tell tother from which in a picture, except it has the filmy morning mist breathing itself up from the water).  And there is such a grave analytical profundity in the faces of &quot;The Connoisseurs;&quot; and such pathos in the picture of the fawn suckling its dead mother, on a snowy waste, with only the blood in the footprints to hint that she is not asleep. And the way he makes animals absolute flesh and blood--insomuch that if the room were darkened ever so little and a motionless living animal placed beside a painted one, no man could tell which was which.</p>
<p>I interrupted myself here, to drop a line to Shirley Brooks and suggest a cartoon for Punch.  It was this.  In one of the Academy salons (in the suite where these pictures are), a fine bust of Landseer stands on a pedestal in the centre of the room.  I suggest that some of Landseer&#x27;s best known animals be represented as having come down out of their frames in the moonlight and grouped themselves about the bust in mourning attitudes.</p>
<p>Well, old man, I am powerful glad to hear from you and shall be powerful glad to see you and Harmony.  I am not going to the provinces because I cannot get halls that are large enough.  I always felt cramped in Hanover Square Rooms, but I find that everybody here speaks with awe and respect of that prodigious place, and wonder that I could fill it so long.</p>
<p>I am hoping to be back in 20 days, but I have so much to go home to and enjoy with a jubilant joy, that it seems hardly possible that it can ever come to pass in so uncertain a world as this.</p>
<p>I have read the novel--[The Gilded Age, published during his absence, December, 1873.]--here, and I like it.  I have made no inquiries about it, though.  My interest in a book ceases with the printing of it.                                    With a world of love,                                              SAML.</p>

MY DEAR FRIEND,--We are all delighted with your commendations of the Gilded Age-and the more so because some of our newspapers have set forth the opinion that Warner really wrote the book and I only added my name to the title page in order to give it a larger sale.  I wrote the first eleven chapters, every word.  and every line.  I also wrote chapters 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 21, 42,  43,  45, 51, 52.  53, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, and portions of 35, 49 and 56.

<p>The fearful financial panic hit the book heavily, for we published it in the midst of it.  But nevertheless in the 8 weeks that have now elapsed since the day we published, we have sold 40,000 copies; which gives L3,000 royalty to be divided between the authors.  This is really the largest two-months&#x27; sale which any American book has ever achieved (unless one excepts the cheaper editions of Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin).  The average price of our book is 16 shillings a copy--Uncle Tom was 2 shillings a copy.  But for the panic our sale would have been doubled, I verily believe.  I do not believe the sale will ultimately go over 100,000 copies.</p>
<p>I shipped to you, from Liverpool, Barley&#x27;s Illustrations of Judd&#x27;s &quot;Margaret&quot; (the waiter at the Adelphi Hotel agreeing to ship it securely per parcel delivery,) and I do hope it did not miscarry, for we in America think a deal of Barley&#x27;s--[Felix Octavius Carr barley, 1822-1888, illustrator of the works of Irving, Cooper, etc.  Probably the most distinguished American illustrator of his time.]-- work.  I shipped the novel (&quot; Margaret&quot;) to you from here a week ago.</p>
<p>Indeed I am thankful for the wife and the child--and if there is one individual creature on all this footstool who is more thoroughly and uniformly and unceasingly happy than I am I defy the world to produce him and prove him.  In my opinion, he doesn&#x27;t exist.  I was a mighty rough, coarse, unpromising subject when Livy took charge of me 4 years ago, and I may still be, to the rest of the world, but not to her.  She has made a very creditable job of me.</p>
<p>Success to the Mark Twain Club!-and the novel shibboleth of the Whistle. Of course any member rising to speak would be required to preface his remark with a keen respectful whistle at the chair-the chair recognizing the speaker with an answering shriek, and then as the speech proceeded its gravity and force would be emphasized and its impressiveness augmented by the continual interjection of whistles in place of punctuation-pauses; and the applause of the audience would be manifested in the same way ....</p>

Miss Clara Spaulding looked in, a moment, yesterday morning, as bright and good as ever.  She would like to lay her love at your feet if she knew I was writing--as would also fifty friends of ours whom you have never seen, and whose homage is as fervent as if the cold and clouds and darkness of a mighty sea did not lie between their hearts and you.

<p>MY DEAR OLD JOE AND HARMONY,--The baby is here and is the great American Giantess--weighing 7 3/4 pounds.  We had to wait a good long time for her, but she was full compensation when she did come.</p>
<p>The Modoc was delighted with it, and gave it her doll at once.  There is nothing selfish about the Modoc.  She is fascinated with the new baby. The Modoc rips and tears around out doors, most of the time, and consequently is as hard as a pine knot and as brown as an Indian.  She is bosom friend to all the ducks, chickens, turkeys and guinea hens on the place.  Yesterday as she marched along the winding path that leads up the hill through the red clover beds to the summer-house, there was a long procession of these fowls stringing contentedly after her, led by a stately rooster who can look over the Modoc&#x27;s head.  The devotion of these vassals has been purchased with daily largess of Indian meal, and so the Modoc, attended by her bodyguard, moves in state wherever she goes.</p>
<p>Susie Crane has built the loveliest study for me, you ever saw.  It is octagonal, with a peaked roof, each octagon filled with a spacious window, and it sits perched in complete isolation on top of an elevation that commands leagues of valley and city and retreating ranges of distant blue hills.  It is a cosy nest, with just room in it for a sofa and a table and three or four chairs--and when the storms sweep down the remote valley and the lightning flashes above the hills beyond, and the rain beats upon the roof over my head, imagine the luxury of it!  It stands 500 feet above the valley and 2 ?miles from it.</p>
<p>However one must not write all day.  We send continents of love to you and yours.                          Affectionately                                         MARK.</p>

<p>Pamela appalled me by saying people had hinted that they wished to visit Livy when she came, but that she had given them no encouragement. I feared that those people would merely comprehend that their courtesies were not wanted, and yet not know exactly why they were not wanted.</p>
<p>I came away feeling that in return for your constant and tireless efforts to secure our bodily comfort and make our visit enjoyable, I had basely repaid you by making you sad and sore-hearted and leaving you so.  And the natural result has fallen to me likewise--for a guilty conscience has harassed me ever since, and I have not had one short quarter of an hour of peace to this moment.</p>
<p>You spoke of Middletown.  Why not go there and live?  Mr. Crane says it is only about a hundred miles this side of New York on the Erie road. The fact that one or two of you might prefer to live somewhere else is not a valid objection--there are no 4 people who would all choose the same place--so it will be vain to wait for the day when your tastes shall be a unit.  I seriously fear that our visit has damaged you in Fredonia, and so I wish you were out of it.</p>
<p>The baby is fat and strong, and Susie the same.  Susie was charmed with the donkey and the doll.                     Ys affectionately                                         SAML.</p>
<p>P. S.--DEAR MA AND PAMELA--I am mainly grieved because I have been rude to a man who has been kind to you--and if you ever feel a desire to apologize to him for me, you may be sure that I will endorse the apology, no matter how strong it may be.  I went to his bank to apologize to him, but my conviction was strong that he was not man enough to know how to take an apology and so I did not make it.</p>

<p>I brought Mrs. Clemens back from her trip in a dreadfully broken-down condition--so by the doctor&#x27;s orders we unpacked the trunks sorrowfully to lie idle here another month instead of going at once to Hartford and proceeding to furnish the new house which is now finished.

Clemens had all along intended to dramatize the story of Colonel      Sellers, and was one day thunderstruck to receive word from      California that a San Francisco dramatist had appropriated his      character in a play written for John T. Raymond.  Clemens had taken      out dramatic copyright on the book, and immediately stopped the      performance by telegraph.  A correspondence between the author and      the dramatist followed, leading to a friendly arrangement by which      the latter agreed to dispose of his version to Mark Twain.  A good      deal of discussion from time to time having arisen over the      authorship of the Sellers play, as presented by Raymond, certain      among the letters that follow may be found of special interest.      Meanwhile we find Clemens writing to Dr. John Brown, of Edinburgh,      on these matters and events in general.

DEAR FRIEND,--I have been writing fifty pages of manuscript a day, on an average, for sometime now, on a book (a story) and consequently have been so wrapped up in it and so dead to anything else, that I have fallen mighty short in letter-writing.  But night before last I discovered that that day&#x27;s chapter was a failure, in conception, moral truth to nature, and execution--enough blemish to impair the excellence of almost any chapter--and so I must burn up the day&#x27;s work and do it all over again. It was plain that I had worked myself out, pumped myself dry.  So I knocked off, and went to playing billiards for a change.  I haven&#x27;t had an idea or a fancy for two days, now--an excellent time to write to friends who have plenty of ideas and fancies of their own, and so will prefer the offerings of the heart before those of the head.  Day after to-morrow I go to a neighboring city to see a five-act-drama of mine brought out, and suggest amendments in it, and would about as soon spend a night in the Spanish Inquisition as sit there and be tortured with all the adverse criticisms I can contrive to imagine the audience is indulging in.  But whether the play be successful or not, I hope I shall never feel obliged to see it performed a second time.  My interest in my work dies a sudden and violent death when the work is done.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>I have invented and patented a pretty good sort of scrap-book (I think) but I have backed down from letting it be known as mine just at present --for I can&#x27;t stand being under discussion on a play and a scrap-book at the same time!</p>
<p>I shall be away two days, and then return to take our tribe to New York, where we shall remain five days buying furniture for the new house, and then go to Hartford and settle solidly down for the winter.  After all that fallow time I ought to be able to go to work again on the book. We shall reach Hartford about the middle of September, I judge.</p>
<p>We have spent the past four months up here on top of a breezy hill, six hundred feet high, some few miles from Elmira, N. Y., and overlooking that town; (Elmira is my wife&#x27;s birthplace and that of Susie and the new baby).  This little summer house on the hill-top (named Quarry Farm because there&#x27;s a quarry on it,) belongs to my wife&#x27;s sister, Mrs. Crane.</p>
<p>A photographer came up the other day and wanted to make some views, and I shall send you the result per this mail.</p>
<p>My study is a snug little octagonal den, with a coal-grate, 6 big windows, one little one, and a wide doorway (the latter opening upon the distant town.) On hot days I spread the study wide open, anchor my papers down with brickbats and write in the midst of the hurricanes, clothed in the same thin linen we make shirts of.  The study is nearly on the peak of the hill; it is right in front of the little perpendicular wall of rock left where they used to quarry stones.  On the peak of the hill is an old arbor roofed with bark and covered with the vine you call the &quot;American Creeper&quot;--its green is almost bloodied with red.  The Study is 30 yards below the old arbor and 200 yards above the dwelling-house-it is remote from all noises.....</p>
<p>Now isn&#x27;t the whole thing pleasantly situated?</p>
<p>In the picture of me in the study you glimpse (through the left-hand window) the little rock bluff that rises behind the pond, and the bases of the little trees on top of it.  The small square window is over the fireplace; the chimney divides to make room for it.  Without the stereoscope it looks like a framed picture.  All the study windows have Venetian blinds; they long ago went out of fashion in America but they have not been replaced with anything half as good yet.</p>
<p>The study is built on top of a tumbled rock-heap that has morning-glories climbing about it and a stone stairway leading down through and dividing it.</p>
<p>There now--if you have not time to read all this, turn it over to &quot;Jock&quot; and drag in the judge to help.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens must put in a late picture of Susie--a picture which she maintains is good, but which I think is slander on the child.</p>
<p>We revisit the Rutland Street home many a time in fancy, for we hold every individual in it in happy and grateful memory.                               Goodbye,                                    Your friend,                                         SAML. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>P. S.--I gave the P. O. Department a blast in the papers about sending misdirected letters of mine back to the writers for reshipment, and got a blast in return, through a New York daily, from the New York postmaster. But I notice that misdirected letters find me, now, without any unnecessary fooling around.</p>

<p>I worked a month at my play, and launched it in New York last Wednesday. I believe it will go.  The newspapers have been complimentary.  It is simply a setting for the one character, Col. Sellers--as a play I guess it will not bear a critical assault in force.</p>
<p>The Warners are as charming as ever.  They go shortly to the devil for a year--(which is but a poetical way of saying they are going to afflict themselves with the unsurpassable--(bad word) of travel for a spell.) I believe they mean to go and see you, first-so they mean to start from heaven to the other place; not from earth.  How is that?</p>
<p>I think that is no slouch of a compliment--kind of a dim religious light about it.  I enjoy that sort of thing.                                    Yrs ever                                              MARK.</p>

<p>Later, P.M.  HOME, 24th &#x27;74.</p>
<p>MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I take back the remark that I can&#x27;t write for the Jan. number.  For Twichell and I have had a long walk in the woods and I got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steam-boating glory and grandeur as I saw them (during 5 years) from the pilothouse.  He said &quot;What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!&quot; I hadn&#x27;t thought of that before.  Would you like a series of papers to run through 3 months or 6 or 9?--or about 4 months, say?                          Yrs ever,                                    MARK.</p>

The      time was November, and the bracing air made the proposition seem      attractive.  They were off one morning early, Twichell carrying a      little bag, and Clemens a basket of luncheon.  A few days before,      Clemens had written Redpath that the Rev. J. H. Twichell and he      expected to start at eight o&#x27;clock Thursday morning &quot;to walk to      Boston in twenty-four hours--or more.

In fact, they got only a little      farther than the twenty-eight miles they made the first day.      Clemens could hardly walk next morning, but they managed to get to      North Ashford, where they took a carriage for the nearest railway      station.  There they telegraphed to Redpath and Howells that they      would be in Boston that evening.  Howells, of course, had a good      supper and good company awaiting them at his home, and the      pedestrians spent two happy days visiting and recounting their      adventures.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was one morning, at his hotel, that Mark Twain wrote the Limerick      letter.

<p>The gentlemen-in-waiting stare to see me sit here telegraphing this letter to you, and no doubt they are smiling in their sleeves.  But let them!  The slow old fashions are good enough for me, thank God, and I will none other.  When I see one of these modern fools sit absorbed, holding the end of a telegraph wire in his hand, and reflect that a thousand miles away there is another fool hitched to the other end of it, it makes me frantic with rage; and then am I more implacably fixed and resolved than ever, to continue taking twenty minutes to telegraph you what I communicate in ten sends by the new way if I would so debase myself.  And when I see a whole silent, solemn drawing-room full of idiots sitting with their hands on each other&#x27;s foreheads &quot;communing,&quot; I tug the white hairs from my head and curse till my asthma brings me the blessed relief of suffocation.  In our old day such a gathering talked pure drivel and &quot;rot,&quot; mostly, but better that, a thousand times, than these dreary conversational funerals that oppress our spirits in this mad generation.</p>
<p>It is sixty years since I was here before.  I walked hither, then, with my precious old friend.  It seems incredible, now, that we did it in two days, but such is my recollection.  I no longer mention that we walked back in a single day, it makes me so furious to see doubt in the face of the hearer.  Men were men in those old times.  Think of one of the puerile organisms in this effeminate age attempting such a feat.</p>
<p>My air-ship was delayed by a collision with a fellow from China loaded with the usual cargo of jabbering, copper-colored missionaries, and so I was nearly an hour on my journey.  But by the goodness of God thirteen of the missionaries were crippled and several killed, so I was content to lose the time.  I love to lose time, anyway, because it brings soothing reminiscences of the creeping railroad days of old, now lost to us forever.</p>
<p>Our game was neatly played, and successfully.--None expected us, of course.  You should have seen the guards at the ducal palace stare when I said, &quot;Announce his grace the Archbishop of Dublin and the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Hartford.&quot;  Arrived within, we were all eyes to see the Duke of Cambridge and his Duchess, wondering if we might remember their faces, and they ours.  In a moment, they came tottering in; he, bent and withered and bald; she blooming with wholesome old age.  He peered through his glasses a moment, then screeched in a reedy voice: &quot;Come to my arms!  Away with titles--I&#x27;ll know ye by no names but Twain and Twichell!  Then fell he on our necks and jammed his trumpet in his ear, the which we filled with shoutings to this effect: &quot;God bless you, old Howells what is left of you!&quot;</p>
<p>We talked late that night--none of your silent idiot &quot;communings&quot; for us --of the olden time.  We rolled a stream of ancient anecdotes over our tongues and drank till the lord Archbishop grew so mellow in the mellow past that Dublin ceased to be Dublin to him and resumed its sweeter forgotten name of New York.  In truth he almost got back into his ancient religion, too, good Jesuit, as he has always been since O&#x27;Mulligan the First established that faith in the Empire.</p>
<p>And we canvassed everybody.  Bailey Aldrich, Marquis of Ponkapog, came in, got nobly drunk, and told us all about how poor Osgood lost his earldom and was hanged for conspiring against the second Emperor--but he didn&#x27;t mention how near he himself came to being hanged, too, for engaging in the same enterprise.  He was as chaffy as he was sixty years ago, too, and swore the Archbishop and I never walked to Boston--but there was never a day that Ponkapog wouldn&#x27;t lie, so be it by the grace of God he got the opportunity.</p>
<p>The Lord High Admiral came in, a hale gentleman close upon seventy and bronzed by the suns and storms of many climes and scarred with the wounds got in many battles, and I told him how I had seen him sit in a high chair and eat fruit and cakes and answer to the name of Johnny.  His granddaughter (the eldest) is but lately warned to the youngest of the Grand Dukes, and so who knows but a day may come when the blood of the Howells&#x27;s may reign in the land?  I must not forget to say, while I think of it, that your new false teeth are done, my dear, and your wig.  Keep your head well bundled with a shawl till the latter comes, and so cheat your persecuting neuralgias and rheumatisms.  Would you believe it?--the Duchess of Cambridge is deafer than you--deafer than her husband.  They call her to breakfast with a salvo of artillery; and usually when it thunders she looks up expectantly and says &quot;come in.....&quot;</p>
<p>The monument to the author of &quot;Gloverson and His Silent partners&quot; is finished.  It is the stateliest and the costliest ever erected to the memory of any man.  This noble classic has now been translated into all the languages of the earth and is adored by all nations and known to all creatures.  Yet I have conversed as familiarly with the author of it as I do with my own great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>I wish you could see old Cambridge and Ponkapog.  I love them as dearly as ever, but privately, my dear, they are not much improvement on idiots. It is melancholy to hear them jabber over the same pointless anecdotes three and four times of an evening, forgetting that they had jabbered them over three or four times the evening before.  Ponkapog still writes poetry, but the old-time fire has mostly gone out of it.  Perhaps his best effort of late years is this:</p>

MY DEAR HOWELLS,-- Let us change the heading to &quot;Piloting on the Miss in the Old Times&quot;--or to &quot;Steamboating on the M. in Old Times&quot;--or to &quot;Personal Old Times on the Miss.&quot;--We could change it for Feb. if now too late for Jan.--I suggest it because the present heading is too pretentious, too broad and general.  It seems to command me to deliver a Second Book of Revelation to the world, and cover all the Old Times the Mississippi (dang that word, it is worse than &quot;type&quot; or &quot;Egypt &quot;) ever saw--whereas here I have finished Article No. III and am about to start on No. 4.  and yet I have spoken of nothing but of Piloting as a science so far; and I doubt if I ever get beyond that portion of my subject. And I don&#x27;t care to.  Any muggins can write about Old Times on the Miss. of 500 different kinds, but I am the only man alive that can scribble about the piloting of that day--and no man ever has tried to scribble about it yet.  Its newness pleases me all the time--and it is about the only new subject I know of.  If I were to write fifty articles they would all be about pilots and piloting--therefore let&#x27;s get the word Piloting into the heading.  There&#x27;s a sort of freshness about that, too.                                    Ys ever,                                              MARK.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But Howells thought the title satisfactory, and indeed it was the      best that could have been selected for the series.

MY DEAR HOWELLS,--It isn&#x27;t the Atlantic audience that distresses me; for it is the only audience that I sit down before in perfect serenity (for the simple reason that it doesn&#x27;t require a &quot;humorist&quot; to paint himself striped and stand on his head every fifteen minutes.) The trouble was, that I was only bent on &quot;working up an atmosphere&quot; and that is to me a most fidgety and irksome thing, sometimes.  I avoid it, usually, but in this case it was absolutely necessary, else every reader would be applying the atmosphere of his own or sea experiences, and that shirt wouldn&#x27;t fit, you know.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>I could have sent this Article II a week ago, or more, but I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to the drudgery of revising and correcting it.  I have been at that tedious work 3 hours, now, and by George but I am glad it is over.</p>
<p>Say--I am as prompt as a clock, if I only know the day a thing is wanted --otherwise I am a natural procrastinaturalist.  Tell me what day and date you want Nos. 3 and 4, and I will tackle and revise them and they&#x27;ll be there to the minute.</p>
<p>I could wind up with No. 4., but there are some things more which I am powerfully moved to write.  Which is natural enough, since I am a person who would quit authorizing in a minute to go to piloting, if the madam would stand it.  I would rather sink a steamboat than eat, any time.</p>
<p>My wife was afraid to write you--so I said with simplicity, &quot;I will give you the language--and ideas.&quot;  Through the infinite grace of God there has not been such another insurrection in the family before as followed this.  However, the letter was written, and promptly, too--whereas, heretofore she has remained afraid to do such things.</p>

<p>You and Aldrich have made one woman deeply and sincerely grateful--Mrs. Clemens.  For months--I may even say years--she had shown unaccountable animosity toward my neck-tie, even getting up in the night to take it with the tongs and blackguard it--sometimes also going so far as to threaten it.</p>
<p>When I said you and Aldrich had given me two new neck-ties, and that they were in a paper in my overcoat pocket, she was in a fever of happiness until she found I was going to frame them; then all the venom in her nature gathered itself together,--insomuch that I, being near to a door, went without, perceiving danger.</p>
<p>Now I wear one of the new neck-ties, nothing being sacred in Mrs. Clemens&#x27;s eyes that can be perverted to a gaud that shall make the person of her husband more alluring than it was aforetime.</p>
<p>Jo Twichell was the delightedest old boy I ever saw, when he read the words you had written in that book.  He and I went to the Concert of the Yale students last night and had a good time.</p>

The more Clemens wrote about the river the more he wished to revisit      it and take Howells with him.  Howells was willing enough to go and      they eventually arranged to take their wives on the excursion.  This      seemed all very well and possible, so long as the time was set for      some date in the future still unfixed.  But Howells was a busy      editor, and it was much more easy for him to promise good-naturedly      than to agree on a definite time of departure.  He explained at      length why he could not make the journey, and added: &quot;Forgive me      having led you on to fix a time; I never thought it would come to      that; I supposed you would die, or something.  I am really more      sorry and ashamed than I can make it appear.&quot;  So the beautiful plan      was put aside, though it was not entirely abandoned for a long time.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We now come to the incident mentioned in Mark Twain&#x27;s letter to      Aldrich, of December the 18th.

It was suggested by one or the other that      his name be put down as a &quot;regular subscriber&quot; for all Mark Twain      photographs as they &quot;came out.&quot;  Clemens returned home and hunted up      fifty-two different specimens, put each into an envelope, and began      mailing them to him, one each morning.

<p>XV.</p>
<p>LETTERS FROM HARTFORD, 1875.  MUCH CORRESPONDENCE WITH HOWELLS</p>
<p>Orion Clemens had kept his job with Bliss only a short time.  His mental make-up was such that it was difficult for him to hold any position long. He meant to do well, but he was unfortunate in his efforts.  His ideas were seldom practical, his nature was yielding and fickle.  He had returned to Keokuk presently, and being convinced there was a fortune in chickens, had prevailed upon his brother to purchase for him a little farm not far from the town.  But the chicken business was not lively and Orion kept the mail hot with manuscripts and propositions of every sort, which he wanted his brother to take under advisement.</p>
<p>Certainly, to Mark Twain Orion Clemens was a trial.  The letters of the latter show that scarcely one of them but contains the outline of some rainbow-chasing scheme, full of wild optimism, and the certainty that somewhere just ahead lies the pot of gold.  Only, now and then, there is a letter of abject humiliation and complete surrender, when some golden vision, some iridescent soap-bubble, had vanished at his touch.  Such depression did not last; by sunrise he was ready with a new dream, new enthusiasm, and with a new letter inviting his &quot;brother Sam&#x27;s&quot; interest and investment.  Yet, his fear of incurring his brother&#x27;s displeasure was pitiful, regardless of the fact that he constantly employed the very means to insure that result.  At one time Clemens made him sign a sworn agreement that he would not suggest any plan or scheme of investment for the period of twelve months.  Orion must have kept this agreement.  He would have gone to the stake before he would have violated an oath, but the stake would have probably been no greater punishment than his sufferings that year.</p>
<p>On the whole, Samuel Clemens was surprisingly patient and considerate with Orion, and there was never a time that he was not willing to help. Yet there were bound to be moments of exasperation; and once, when his mother, or sister, had written, suggesting that he encourage his brother&#x27;s efforts, he felt moved to write at considerable freedom.</p>

<p>Ma, whenever you need money I hope you won&#x27;t be backward about saying so --you can always have it.  We stint ourselves in some ways, but we have no desire to stint you.  And we don&#x27;t intend to, either.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t &quot;encourage&quot; Orion.  Nobody can do that, conscientiously, for the reason that before one&#x27;s letter has time to reach him he is off on some new wild-goose chase.  Would you encourage in literature a man who, the older he grows the worse he writes?  Would you encourage Orion in the glaring insanity of studying law?  If he were packed and crammed full of law, it would be worthless lumber to him, for his is such a capricious and ill-regulated mind that he would apply the principles of the law with no more judgment than a child of ten years.  I know what I am saying. I laid one of the plainest and simplest of legal questions before Orion once, and the helpless and hopeless mess he made of it was absolutely astonishing.  Nothing aggravates me so much as to have Orion mention law or literature to me.</p>
<p>Well, I cannot encourage him to try the ministry, because he would change his religion so fast that he would have to keep a traveling agent under wages to go ahead of him to engage pulpits and board for him.</p>
<p>I cannot conscientiously encourage him to do anything but potter around his little farm and put in his odd hours contriving new and impossible projects at the rate of 365 a year--which is his customary average. He says he did well in Hannibal!  Now there is a man who ought to be entirely satisfied with the grandeurs, emoluments and activities of a hen farm--</p>
<p>If you ask me to pity Orion, I can do that.  I can do it every day and all day long.  But one can&#x27;t &quot;encourage&quot; quick-silver, because the instant you put your finger on it it isn&#x27;t there.  No, I am saying too much--he does stick to his literary and legal aspirations; and he naturally would select the very two things which he is wholly and preposterously unfitted for.  If I ever become able, I mean to put Orion on a regular pension without revealing the fact that it is a pension. That is best for him.  Let him consider it a periodical loan, and pay interest out of the principal.  Within a year&#x27;s time he would be looking upon himself as a benefactor of mine, in the way of furnishing me a good permanent investment for money, and that would make him happy and satisfied with himself.  If he had money he would share with me in a moment and I have no disposition to be stingy with him.                                    Affly                                         SAM. Livy sends love.</p>

Situated as I am, I would not be able to understand, now, how you could pass by this town without feeling that you were running a wanton risk and doing a daredevil thing.  I consider it settled that you are to come in March, and I would be sincerely sorry to learn that you and Mrs. Howells feel differently about it.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The piloting material has been uncovering itself by degrees, until it has exposed such a huge hoard to my view that a whole book will be required to contain it if I use it.  So I have agreed to write the book for Bliss. --[The book idea was later given up for the time being.]-- I won&#x27;t be able to run the articles in the Atlantic later than the September number, for the reason that a subscription book issued in the fall has a much larger sale than if issued at any other season of the year.  It is funny when I reflect that when I originally wrote you and proposed to do from 6 to 9 articles for the magazine, the vague thought in my mind was that 6 might exhaust the material and 9 would be pretty sure to do it.  Or rather it seems to me that that was my thought--can&#x27;t tell at this distance.  But in truth 9 chapters don&#x27;t now seem to more than open up the subject fairly and start the yarn to wagging.</p>
<p>I have been sick a-bed several days, for the first time in 21 years. How little confirmed invalids appreciate their advantages.  I was able to read the English edition of the Greville Memoirs through without interruption, take my meals in bed, neglect all business without a pang, and smoke 18 cigars a day.  I try not to look back upon these 21 years with a feeling of resentment, and yet the partialities of Providence do seem to me to be slathered around (as one may say) without that gravity and attention to detail which the real importance of the matter would seem to suggest.                               Yrs ever                                         MARK.</p>

The thought of      drifting down the Mississippi so attracted both Clemens and Howells,      that they talked of it when they met, and wrote of it when they were      separated.  Howells, beset by uncertainties, playfully tried to put      the responsibility upon his wife.  Once he wrote: &quot;She says in the      noblest way, &#x27;Well, go to New Orleans, if you want to so much&#x27; (you      know the tone).  I suppose it will do if I let you know about the      middle of February?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But they had to give it up in the end.  Howells wrote that he had      been under the weather, and on half work the whole winter.  He did      not feel that he had earned his salary, he said, or that he was      warranted in taking a three weeks&#x27; pleasure trip.  Clemens offered      to pay all the expenses of the trip, but only indefinite      postponement followed.  It would be seven years more before Mark      Twain would return to the river, and then not with Howells.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> In a former chapter mention has been made of Charles Warren      Stoddard, whom Mark Twain had known in his California days.

During the period that he had been acting as      Mark Twain&#x27;s secretary in London, he had taken pleasure in      collecting for him the news reports of the celebrated Tichborn      Claimant case, then in the English courts.  Clemens thought of      founding a story on it, and did, in fact, use the idea, though &#x27;The      American Claimant,&#x27; which he wrote years later, had little or no      connection with the Tichborn episode.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                        To C.

<p>I am writing a series of 7-page articles for the Atlantic at $20 a page; but as they do not pay anybody else as much as that, I do not complain (though at the same time I do swear that I am not content.)  However the awful respectability of the magazine makes up.</p>
<p>I have cut your articles about San Marco out of a New York paper (Joe Twichell saw it and brought it home to me with loud admiration,) and sent it to Howells.  It is too bad to fool away such good literature in a perishable daily journal.</p>

The Atlantic page      probably contained about a thousand words, which would make his      price average, say, two cents per word.  Thirty years later, when      his fame was not much more extended, his pay for the same matter      would have been fifteen times as great, that is to say, at the rate      of thirty cents per word.  But in that early time there were no      Sunday magazines--no literary magazines at all except the Atlantic,      and Harpers, and a few fashion periodicals.  Probably there were      news-stands, but it is hard to imagine what they must have looked      like without the gay pictorial cover-femininity that to-day pleases      and elevates the public and makes author and artist affluent.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Clemens worked steadily on the river chapters, and Howells was      always praising him and urging him to go on.

I would rather have my ignorance than another man&#x27;s knowledge, because I have got so much more of it.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

I can perceive in the group, that Mr. Howells is feeling as I so often feel, viz: &quot;Well, no doubt I am in the wrong, though I do not know how or where or why--but anyway it will be safest to look meek, and walk circumspectly for a while, and not discuss the thing.&quot;  And you look exactly as Mrs. Clemens does after she has said, &quot;Indeed I do not wonder that you can frame no reply: for you know only too well, that your conduct admits of no excuse, palliation or argument--none!</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>I shall just delight in that group on account of the good old human domestic spirit that pervades it--bother these family groups that put on a state aspect to get their pictures taken in.</p>

This made me shudder; for it was equivalent to Allie Spaulding&#x27;s saying &quot;Mr. Atwater is a mean thing;&quot; or Rev.

<p>However, Livy does not often get into one of these furies, God be thanked.</p>
<p>In Brooklyn, Baltimore, Washington, Cincinnati, St. Louis and Chicago, the play paid me an average of nine hundred dollars a week.  In smaller towns the average is $400 to $500.</p>
<p>This is Susie&#x27;s birth-day.  Lizzie brought her in at 8.30 this morning (before we were up) hooded with a blanket, red curl-papers in her hair, a great red japonica, in one hand (for Livy) and a yellow rose-bud nestled in violets (for my buttonhole) in the other--and she looked wonderfully pretty.  She delivered her memorials and received her birth-day kisses. Livy laid her japonica, down to get a better &quot;holt&quot; for kissing-which Susie presently perceived, and became thoughtful: then said sorrowfully, turning the great deeps of her eyes upon her mother: &quot;Don&#x27;t you care for you wow?&quot;</p>
<p>Right after breakfast we got up a rousing wood fire in the main hall (it is a cold morning) illuminated the place with a rich glow from all the globes of the newell chandelier, spread a bright rug before the fire, set a circling row of chairs (pink ones and dove-colored) and in the midst a low invalid-table covered with a fanciful cloth and laden with the presents--a pink azalia in lavish bloom from Rosa; a gold inscribed Russia-leather bible from Patrick and Mary; a gold ring (inscribed) from &quot;Maggy Cook;&quot; a silver thimble (inscribed with motto and initials) from Lizzie; a rattling mob of Sunday clad dolls from Livy and Annie, and a Noah&#x27;s Ark from me, containing 200 wooden animals such as only a human being could create and only God call by name without referring to the passenger list.  Then the family and the seven servants assembled there, and Susie and the &quot;Bay&quot; arrived in state from above, the Bay&#x27;s head being fearfully and wonderfully decorated with a profusion of blazing red flowers and overflowing cataracts of lycopodium.  Wee congratulatory notes accompanied the presents of the servants.  I tell you it was a great occasion and a striking and cheery group, taking all the surroundings into account and the wintry aspect outside.</p>

<p>Joe Twichell preached morning and evening here last Sunday; took midnight train for Boston; got an early breakfast and started by rail at 7.30 A. M.  for Concord; swelled around there until 1 P. M., seeing everything; then traveled on top of a train to Lexington; saw everything there; traveled on top of a train to Boston, (with hundreds in company) deluged with dust, smoke and cinders; yelled and hurrahed all the way like a schoolboy; lay flat down to dodge numerous bridges, and sailed into the depot, howling with excitement and as black as a chimney-sweep; got to Young&#x27;s Hotel at 7 P. M.; sat down in reading-room and immediately fell asleep; was promptly awakened by a porter who supposed he was drunk; wandered around an hour and a half; then took 9 P. M. train, sat down in smoking car and remembered nothing more until awakened by conductor as the train came into Hartford at 1.30 A. M.  Thinks he had simply a glorious time--and wouldn&#x27;t have missed the Centennial for the world. He would have run out to see us a moment at Cambridge, but was too dirty. I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted him there--his appalling energy would have been an insufferable reproach to mild adventurers like you and me.</p>
<p>Well, he is welcome to the good time he had--I had a deal better one. My narrative has made Mrs. Clemens wish she could have been there. --When I think over what a splendid good sociable time I had in your house I feel ever so thankful to the wise providence that thwarted our several ably-planned and ingenious attempts to get to Lexington.  I am coming again before long, and then she shall be of the party.</p>
<p>Now you said that you and Mrs. Howells could run down here nearly any Saturday.  Very well then, let us call it next Saturday, for a &quot;starter.&quot; Can you do that?  By that time it will really be spring and you won&#x27;t freeze.  The birds are already out; a small one paid us a visit yesterday.  We entertained it and let it go again, Susie protesting.</p>
<p>The spring laziness is already upon me--insomuch that the spirit begins to move me to cease from Mississippi articles and everything else and give myself over to idleness until we go to New Orleans.  I have one article already finished, but somehow it doesn&#x27;t seem as proper a chapter to close with as the one already in your hands.  I hope to get in a mood and rattle off a good one to finish with--but just now all my moods are lazy ones.</p>
<p>Winnie&#x27;s literature sings through me yet!  Surely that child has one of these &quot;futures&quot; before her.</p>
<p>Now try to come--will you?</p>
<p>With the warmest regards of the two of us--                          Yrs ever,                               S. L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens sent a note to Mrs. Howells, which will serve as a pendant to the foregoing.</p>

<p>MY DEAR MRS. HOWELLS,--Don&#x27;t dream for one instant that my not getting a letter from you kept me from Boston.  I am too anxious to go to let such a thing as that keep me.</p>
<p>Mr. Clemens did have such a good time with you and Mr. Howells. He evidently has no regret that he did not get to the Centennial.  I was driven nearly distracted by his long account of Mr. Howells and his wanderings.  I would keep asking if they ever got there, he would never answer but made me listen to a very minute account of everything that they did.  At last I found them back where they started from.</p>
<p>If you find misspelled words in this note, you will remember my infirmity and not hold me responsible.                          Affectionately yours,                                         LIVY L. CLEMENS.</p>
<p>In spite of his success with the Sellers play and his itch to follow it up, Mark Twain realized what he believed to be his literary limitations. All his life he was inclined to consider himself wanting in the finer gifts of character-shading and delicate portrayal.  Remembering Huck Finn, and the rare presentation of Joan of Arc, we may not altogether agree with him.  Certainly, he was never qualified to delineate those fine artificialities of life which we are likely to associate with culture, and perhaps it was something of this sort that caused the hesitation confessed in the letter that follows.  Whether the plan suggested interested Howells or not we do not know.  In later years Howells wrote a novel called The Story of a Play; this may have been its beginning.</p>

MY DEAR HOWELLS,--An actor named D. H. Harkins has been here to ask me to put upon paper a 5-act play which he has been mapping out in his mind for 3 or 4 years.   He sat down and told me his plot all through, in a clear, bright way, and I was a deal taken with it; but it is a line of characters whose fine shading and artistic development requires an abler hand than mine; so I easily perceived that I must not make the attempt. But I liked the man, and thought there was a good deal of stuff in him; and therefore I wanted his play to be written, and by a capable hand, too.  So I suggested you, and said I would write and see if you would be willing to undertake it.  If you like the idea, he will call upon you in the course of two or three weeks and describe his plot and his characters.  Then if it doesn&#x27;t strike you favorably, of course you can simply decline; but it seems to me well worth while that you should hear what he has to say.  You could also &quot;average&quot; him while he talks, and judge whether he could play your priest--though I doubt if any man can do that justice.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>

<p>I have been talking to you and writing to you as if you were present when I traded the machine to Bliss for a twelve-dollar saddle worth $25 (cheating him outrageously, of course--but conscience got the upper hand again and I told him before I left the premises that I&#x27;d pay for the saddle if he didn&#x27;t like the machine--on condition that he donate said machine to a charity)</p>
<p>This was a little over five weeks ago--so I had long ago concluded that Bliss didn&#x27;t want the machine and did want the saddle--wherefore I jumped at the chance of shoving the machine off onto you, saddle or no saddle so I got the blamed thing out of my sight.</p>
<p>The saddle hangs on Tara&#x27;s walls down below in the stable, and the machine is at Bliss&#x27;s grimly pursuing its appointed mission, slowly and implacably rotting away another man&#x27;s chances for salvation.</p>
<p>I have sent Bliss word not to donate it to a charity (though it is a pity to fool away a chance to do a charity an ill turn,) but to let me know when he has got his dose, because I&#x27;ve got another candidate for damnation.  You just wait a couple of weeks and if you don&#x27;t see the Type-Writer come tilting along toward Cambridge with an unsatisfied appetite in its eye, I lose my guess.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t you be mad about this blunder, Howells--it only comes of a bad memory, and the stupidity which is inseparable from true genius.  Nothing intentionally criminal in it.                               Yrs ever                                         MARK.</p>

I perhaps made a mistake in not writing it in the first person.  If I went on, now, and took him into manhood, he would just like like all the one-horse men in literature and the reader would conceive a hearty contempt for him.  It is not a boy&#x27;s book, at all.  It will only be read by adults.

<p>Moreover the book is plenty long enough as it stands.  It is about 900 pages of MS, and may be 1000 when I shall have finished &quot;working up&quot; vague places; so it would make from 130 to 150 pages of the Atlantic-- about what the Foregone Conclusion made, isn&#x27;t it?</p>
<p>I would dearly like to see it in the Atlantic, but I doubt if it would pay the publishers to buy the privilege, or me to sell it.  Bret Harte has sold his novel (same size as mine, I should say) to Scribner&#x27;s Monthly for $6,500 (publication to begin in September, I think,) and he gets a royalty of 7 ?per cent from Bliss in book form afterwards.  He gets a royalty of ten per cent on it in England (issued in serial numbers) and the same royalty on it in book form afterwards, and is to receive an advance payment of five hundred pounds the day the first No. of the serial appears.  If I could do as well, here, and there, with mine, it might possibly pay me, but I seriously doubt it though it is likely I could do better in England than Bret, who is not widely known there.</p>
<p>You see I take a vile, mercenary view of things--but then my household expenses are something almost ghastly.</p>
<p>By and by I shall take a boy of twelve and run him on through life (in the first person) but not Tom Sawyer--he would not be a good character for it.</p>
<p>I wish you would promise to read the MS of Tom Sawyer some time, and see if you don&#x27;t really decide that I am right in closing with him as a boy- and point out the most glaring defects for me.  It is a tremendous favor to ask, and I expect you to refuse and would be ashamed to expect you to do otherwise.  But the thing has been so many months in my mind that it seems a relief to snake it out.  I don&#x27;t know any other person whose judgment I could venture to take fully and entirely.  Don&#x27;t hesitate about saying no, for I know how your time is taxed, and I would have honest need to blush if you said yes.</p>
<p>Osgood and I are &quot;going for&quot; the puppy G---- on infringement of trademark.  To win one or two suits of this kind will set literary folks on a firmer bottom.

<p>But I will gladly send it to you if you will do as follows: dramatize it, if you perceive that you can, and take, for your remuneration, half of the first $6000 which I receive for its representation on the stage.  You could alter the plot entirely, if you chose.  I could help in the work, most cheerfully, after you had arranged the plot.  I have my eye upon two young girls who can play &quot;Tom&quot; and &quot;Huck.&quot;  I believe a good deal of a drama can be made of it.  Come--can&#x27;t you tackle this in the odd hours of your vacation?  or later, if you prefer?</p>
<p>I do wish you could come down once more before your holiday.  I&#x27;d give anything!                     Yrs ever,                               MARK.</p>
<p>Howells wrote that he had no time for the dramatization and urged Clemens to undertake it himself.  He was ready to read the story, whenever it should arrive.  Clemens did not hurry, however, The publication of Tom Sawyer could wait.  He already had a book in press--the volume of Sketches New and Old, which he had prepared for Bliss several years before.</p>
<p>Sketches was issued that autumn, and Howells gave it a good notice-- possibly better than it deserved.</p>
<p>Considered among Mark Twain&#x27;s books to-day, the collection of sketches does not seem especially important.  With the exception of the frog story and the &quot;True Story&quot; most of those included--might be spared.  Clemens himself confessed to Howells that He wished, when it was too late, that he had destroyed a number of them.  The book, however, was distinguished in a special way: it contains Mark Twain&#x27;s first utterance in print on the subject of copyright, a matter in which he never again lost interest. The absurdity and injustice of the copyright laws both amused and irritated him, and in the course of time he would be largely instrumental in their improvement.  In the book his open petition to Congress that all property rights, as well as literary ownership, should be put on the copyright basis and limited to a &quot;beneficent term of forty-two years,&quot; was more or less of a joke, but, like so many of Mark Twain&#x27;s jokes, it was founded on reason and justice.</p>
<p>He had another idea, that was not a joke: an early plan in the direction of international copyright.  It was to be a petition signed by the leading American authors, asking the United States to declare itself to be the first to stand for right and justice by enacting laws against the piracy of foreign books.  It was a rather utopian scheme, as most schemes for moral progress are, in their beginning.  It would not be likely ever to reach Congress, but it would appeal to Howells and his Cambridge friends.  Clemens wrote, outlining his plan of action.</p>

MY DEAR HOWELLS,--My plan is this--you are to get Mr. Lowell and Mr. Longfellow to be the first signers of my copyright petition; you must sign it yourself and get Mr. Whittier to do likewise.  Then Holmes will sign--he said he would if he didn&#x27;t have to stand at the head.  Then I&#x27;m fixed.  I will then put a gentlemanly chap under wages and send him personally to every author of distinction in the country, and corral the rest of the signatures.  Then I&#x27;ll have the whole thing lithographed (about a thousand copies) and move upon the President and Congress in person, but in the subordinate capacity of a party who is merely the agent of better and wiser men--men whom the country cannot venture to laugh at.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>I will ask the President to recommend the thing in his message (and if he should ask me to sit down and frame the paragraph for him I should blush --but still I would frame it.)</p>
<p>Next I would get a prime leader in Congress: I would also see that votes enough to carry the measure were privately secured before the bill was offered.  This I would try through my leader and my friends there.</p>
<p>And then if Europe chose to go on stealing from us, we would say with noble enthusiasm, &quot;American lawmakers do steal but not from foreign authors--Not from foreign authors!&quot;</p>
<p>You see, what I want to drive into the Congressional mind is the simple fact that the moral law is &quot;Thou shalt not steal&quot;--no matter what Europe may do.</p>
<p>I swear I can&#x27;t see any use in robbing European authors for the benefit of American booksellers, anyway.</p>
<p>If we can ever get this thing through Congress, we can try making copyright perpetual, some day.  There would be no sort of use in it, since only one book in a hundred millions outlives the present copyright term--no sort of use except that the writer of that one book have his rights--which is something.</p>
<p>If we only had some God in the country&#x27;s laws, instead of being in such a sweat to get Him into the Constitution, it would be better all around.</p>
<p>The only man who ever signed my petition with alacrity, and said that the fact that a thing was right was all-sufficient, was Rev. Dr. Bushnell.</p>
<p>I have lost my old petition, (which was brief) but will draft and enclose another--not in the words it ought to be, but in the substance.  I want Mr. Lowell to furnish the words (and the ideas too,) if he will do it.</p>
<p>Say--Redpath beseeches me to lecture in Boston in November--telegraphs that Beecher&#x27;s and Nast&#x27;s withdrawal has put him in the tightest kind of a place.  So I guess I&#x27;ll do that old &quot;Roughing It&quot; lecture over again in November and repeat it 2 or 3 times in New York while I am at it.</p>
<p>Can I take a carriage after the lecture and go out and stay with you that night, provided you find at that distant time that it will not inconvenience you?  Is Aldrich home yet?                               With love to you all                                         Yrs ever,                                              S. L. C.</p>

The newspaper praises bestowed upon the &quot;Innocents Abroad&quot; were large and generous, but somehow I hadn&#x27;t confidence in the critical judgement of the parties who furnished them.  You know how that is, yourself, from reading the newspaper notices of your own books.  They gratify a body, but they always leave a small pang behind in the shape of a fear that the critic&#x27;s good words could not safely be depended upon as authority.  Yours is the recognized critical Court of Last Resort in this country; from its decision there is no appeal; and so, to have gained this decree of yours before I am forty years old, I regard as a thing to be right down proud of.  Mrs. Clemens says, &quot;Tell him I am just as grateful to him as I can be.&quot;  (It sounds as if she were grateful to you for heroically trampling the truth under foot in order to praise me but in reality it means that she is grateful to you for being bold enough to utter a truth which she fully believes all competent people know, but which none has heretofore been brave enough to utter.)  You see, the thing that gravels her is that I am so persistently glorified as a mere buffoon, as if that entirely covered my case--which she denies with venom.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The other day Mrs. Clemens was planning a visit to you, and so I am waiting with a pleasurable hope for the result of her deliberations. We are expecting visitors every day, now, from New York; and afterward some are to come from Elmira.  I judge that we shall then be free to go Bostonward.  I should be just delighted; because we could visit in comfort, since we shouldn&#x27;t have to do any shopping--did it all in New York last week, and a tremendous pull it was too.</p>
<p>Mrs. C. said the other day, &quot;We will go to Cambridge if we have to walk; for I don&#x27;t believe we can ever get the Howellses to come here again until we have been there.&quot;  I was gratified to see that there was one string, anyway, that could take her to Cambridge.  But I will do her the justice to say that she is always wanting to go to Cambridge, independent of the selfish desire to get a visit out of you by it.

In the foregoing letter they were planning a visit to Cambridge.  In      the one that follows they seem to have made it--with certain      results, perhaps not altogether amusing at the moment.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                  To W.

<p>Mrs. Clemens&#x27;s bodily strength came up handsomely under that cheery respite from household and nursery cares.  I do hope that Mrs. Howells&#x27;s didn&#x27;t go correspondingly down, under the added burden to her cares and responsibilities.  Of course I didn&#x27;t expect to get through without committing some crimes and hearing of them afterwards, so I have taken the inevitable lashings and been able to hum a tune while the punishment went on.  I &quot;caught it&quot; for letting Mrs. Howells bother and bother about her coffee when it was &quot;a good deal better than we get at home.&quot; I &quot;caught it&quot; for interrupting Mrs. C. at the last moment and losing her the opportunity to urge you not to forget to send her that MS when the printers are done with it.  I &quot;caught it&quot; once more for personating that drunken Col. James.  I &quot;caught it&quot; for mentioning that Mr. Longfellow&#x27;s picture was slightly damaged; and when, after a lull in the storm, I confessed, shame-facedly, that I had privately suggested to you that we hadn&#x27;t any frames, and that if you wouldn&#x27;t mind hinting to Mr. Houghton, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., the Madam was simply speechless for the space of a minute. Then she said:</p>
<p>&quot;How could you, Youth!  The idea of sending Mr. Howells, with his sensitive nature, upon such a repulsive er--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Howells won&#x27;t mind it!  You don&#x27;t know Howells.  Howells is a man who--&quot; She was gone.  But George was the first person she stumbled on in the hall, so she took it out of George.  I was glad of that, because it saved the babies.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve got another rattling good character for my novel!  That great work is mulling itself into shape gradually.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clemens sends love to Mrs. Howells--meantime she is diligently laying up material for a letter to her.                               Yrs ever                                         MARK.</p>

MY DEAR HOWELLS,-- Herewith is the proof.  In spite of myself, how awkwardly I do jumble words together; and how often I do use three words where one would answer--a thing I am always trying to guard against. I shall become as slovenly a writer as Charles Francis Adams, if I don&#x27;t look out.  (That is said in jest; because of course I do not seriously fear getting so bad as that.  I never shall drop so far toward his and Bret Harte&#x27;s level as to catch myself saying &quot;It must have been wiser to have believed that he might have accomplished it if he could have felt that he would have been supported by those who should have &amp;c.  &amp;c.  &amp;c.) The reference to Bret Harte reminds me that I often accuse him of being a deliberate imitator of Dickens; and this in turn reminds me that I have charged unconscious plagiarism upon Charley Warner; and this in turn reminds me that I have been delighting my soul for two weeks over a bran new and ingenious way of beginning a novel--and behold, all at once it flashes upon me that Charley Warner originated the idea 3 years ago and told me about it!  Aha !  So much for self-righteousness!  I am well repaid.  Here are 108 pages of MS, new and clean, lying disgraced in the waste paper basket, and I am beginning the novel over again in an unstolen way.  I would not wonder if I am the worst literary thief in the world, without knowing it.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>It is glorious news that you like Tom Sawyer so well.  I mean to see to it that your review of it shall have plenty of time to appear before the other notices.  Mrs. Clemens decides with you that the book should issue as a book for boys, pure and simple--and so do I.  It is surely the correct idea.  As to that last chapter, I think of just leaving it off and adding nothing in its place.  Something told me that the book was done when I got to that point--and so the strong temptation to put Huck&#x27;s life at the Widow&#x27;s into detail, instead of generalizing it in a paragraph was resisted.  Just send Sawyer to me by express--I enclose money for it.  If it should get lost it will be no great matter.</p>
<p>Company interfered last night, and so &quot;Private Theatricals&quot; goes over till this evening, to be read aloud.  Mrs. Clemens is mad, but the story will take that all out.  This is going to be a splendid winter night for fireside reading, anyway.</p>
<p>I am almost at a dead stand-still with my new story, on account of the misery of having to do it all over again.  We--all send love to you--all.                               Yrs ever                                         MARK.</p>
<p>The &quot;story&quot; referred to may have been any one of several begun by him at this time.  His head was full of ideas for literature of every sort. Many of his beginnings came to nothing, for the reason that he started wrong, or with no definitely formed plan.  Others of his literary enterprises were condemned by his wife for their grotesqueness or for the offense they might give in one way or another, however worthy the intention behind them.  Once he wrote a burlesque on family history &quot;The Autobiography of a Damned Fool.&quot;  &quot;Livy wouldn&#x27;t have it,&quot; he said later, &quot;so I gave it up.&quot;  The world is indebted to Mark Twain&#x27;s wife for the check she put upon his fantastic or violent impulses.  She was his public, his best public--clearheaded and wise.  That he realized this, and was willing to yield, was by no means the least of his good fortunes. We may believe that he did not always yield easily, and perhaps sometimes only out of love for her.  In the letter which he wrote her on her thirtieth birthday we realize something of what she had come to mean in his life.</p>
