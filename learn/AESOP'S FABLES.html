<p>The Wolf and the Lamb</p>
<p>WOLF, meeting  with a  Lamb astray  from the  fold, resolved  not to lay violent hands on him, but to find some plea  to justify to the Lamb the Wolf&#x27;s right  to eat him.  He thus  addressed him: &quot;Sirrah, last  year you grossly insulted  me.&quot; &quot;Indeed,&quot; bleated the Lamb in a mournful  tone of voice, &quot;I was not then  born.&quot; Then said the Wolf, &quot;You feed in my pasture.&quot;  &quot;No, good sir,&quot; replied the Lamb, &quot;I have not  yet tasted grass.&quot;   Again said the  Wolf, &quot;You drink  of my well.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; exclaimed the Lamb, &quot;I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother&#x27;s  milk is both food and drink to me.&quot;  Upon  which the Wolf seized him and ate him  up, saying, &quot;Well! I won&#x27;t remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my imputations.&quot;  The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.</p>
<p>The Bat and the Weasels</p>
<p>A BAT who fell upon the ground and  was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be  spared his life.  The  Weasel refused, saying  that he was  by nature the  enemy of all birds.  The Bat assured him  that he was not a  bird, but a mouse, and  thus was set free.  Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated not to eat him.  The Weasel said that he had  a special  hostility to  mice.  The  Bat assured  him that  he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a second time escaped.</p>
<p>It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.</p>
<p>The Ass and the Grasshopper</p>
<p>AN  ASS having  heard some  Grasshoppers chirping,  was highly  enchanted; and, desiring to possess the same charms  of melody, demanded what sort of  food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices.  They replied, &quot;The dew.&quot;  The  Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a short time died of hunger.</p>
<p>The Lion and the Mouse</p>
<p>A LION  was awakened  from sleep  by a  Mouse running  over his  face. Rising up angrily, he  caught him  and was  about to  kill him,  when the  Mouse piteously entreated, saying:  &quot;If you would only spare  my life, I would be sure to  repay your kindness.&quot;  The  Lion laughed and  let him go.   It happened shortly  after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters, who bound him by st ropes to  the ground.  The Mouse, recognizing his roar,  came gnawed the rope with his  teeth, and set him free, exclaim</p>
<p>&quot;You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, expecting to  receive from me any repayment of your favor; I now you know that it is possible for even a Mouse to con benefits on a Lion.&quot;</p>
<p>The Charcoal-Burner and the Fuller</p>
<p>A CHARCOAL-BURNER  carried on  his trade  in his  own house.   One day  he met a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying that  they should be  far better  neighbors and  that their  housekeeping expenses would be lessened.  The Fuller  replied, &quot;The arrangement  is impossible as  far as I  am concerned, for  whatever I  should whiten,  you would  immediately blacken again with your charcoal.&quot;</p>
<p>Like will draw like.</p>
<p>The Father and His Sons</p>
<p>A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among  themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations, he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of disunion; and for this purpose  he one day told them to  bring him a bundle of  sticks.  When they had done  so, he placed the faggot into the hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in pieces.  They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it.  He next opened the faggot,  took the sticks separately, one by one,  and again put them into his sons&#x27; hands, upon which they broke them easily.  He then addressed them in these words:  &quot;My sons,  if you are of one mind, and  unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured by all the attempts  of your enemies; but  if you are  divided among yourselves,  you will be  broken as easily as these sticks.&quot;</p>
<p>The Boy Hunting Locusts</p>
<p>A BOY was  hunting for locusts.   He had caught  a goodly number,  when he saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to take him.  The Scorpion, showing his  sting, said: If  you had but  touched me, my  friend, you would have lost me, and all your locusts too!&quot;</p>
<p>The Cock and the Jewel</p>
<p>A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious stone and exclaimed:  &quot;If your owner had found thee,  and not I, he would have taken  thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have found thee for no purpose. I would rather have one barleycorn than all the jewels in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kingdom of the Lion</p>
<p>THE BEASTS of  the field and  forest had a  Lion as their  king.  He was neither wrathful, cruel, nor tyrannical, but just and gentle as a king could be.  During his reign he made a royal proclamation  for a general assembly of all the  birds and beasts, and drew up conditions for a universal league, in which the Wolf and the Lamb, the Panther and the Kid, the Tiger and the Stag, the Dog and the Hare, should live together in perfect peace and amity.  The Hare said, &quot;Oh, how I have longed to see this day, in which  the weak shall take their place with  impunity by the side of the strong.&quot;  And after the Hare said this, he ran for his life.</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Crane</p>
<p>A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the Crane had extracted  the bone and  demanded the  promised payment,  the Wolf,  grinning and  grinding his teeth, exclaimed: &quot;Why, you have surely already had a sufficient recompense,  in having been permitted to draw out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf.&quot;</p>
<p>In serving the wicked,  expect no reward, and  be thankful if you  escape injury for your pains.</p>
<p>The Fisherman Piping</p>
<p>A  FISHERMAN skilled  in music  took his  flute and  his nets  to the  seashore. Standing on  a projecting  rock, he  played several  tunes in  the hope that the fish, attracted by  his melody, would  of their own  accord dance into  his net, which he had placed  below. At last, having  long waited in vain,  he laid aside his flute, and  casting his net  into the sea,  made an excellent  haul of fish. When he saw them  leaping about in the  net upon the rock  he said: &quot;O you  most perverse creatures, when I piped you would not dance, but now that I have ceased you do so merrily.&quot;</p>
<p>Hercules and the Wagoner</p>
<p>A CARTER was  driving a wagon  along a country  lane, when the  wheels sank down deep into a rut.  The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood looking at  the wagon, and did nothing  but utter loud cries  to Hercules to come  and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and  thus addressed him:  &quot;Put your shoulders  to the wheels, my man.  Goad on your bullocks, and never more pray to me for  help, until you  have done  your best  to help  yourself, or  depend upon  it you will henceforth pray in vain.&quot;</p>
<p>Self-help is the best help.</p>
<p>The Ants and the Grasshopper</p>
<p>THE  ANTS  were spending  a  fine winter&#x27;s  day  drying grain  collected  in the summertime.   A  Grasshopper, perishing  with  famine, passed  by  and earnestly begged for a little food.  The Ants  inquired of him, &quot;Why did you not  treasure up food during the  summer?&#x27;  He replied, &quot;I  had not leisure enough.   I passed the days in singing.&quot;  They then said in derision:  &quot;If you were foolish  enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter.&quot;</p>
<p>The Traveler and His Dog</p>
<p>A  TRAVELER  about to  set  out on  a  journey saw  his  Dog stand  at  the door stretching himself.   He asked  him sharply:   &quot;Why do  you stand  there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so  come with me instantly.&quot;  The Dog,  wagging his tail, replied:  &quot;O, master! I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.</p>
<p>The Dog and the Shadow</p>
<p>A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream  with a piece of flesh in his mouth,  saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another Dog, with a piece of meat double his  own in size.   He immediately let  go of his  own, and fiercely attacked the other  Dog to get  his larger piece  from him.  He  thus lost both: that which he  grasped at in  the water, because  it was a  shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.</p>
<p>The Mole and His Mother</p>
<p>A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother:  &quot;I am sure than I can see, Mother!&quot;  In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his Mother  placed before him a  few grains of  frankincense, and asked,  &quot;What is it?&#x27;   The young Mole said, &quot;It is a pebble.&quot;  His  Mother exclaimed:  &quot;My son, I am afraid  that you are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense of smell.</p>
<p>The Herdsman and the Lost Bull</p>
<p>A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold.   After a long and fruitless search, he made  a vow that, if he could only  discover the thief who had  stolen the Calf,  he would offer  a lamb in  sacrifice to Hermes, Pan,  and  the Guardian  Deities  of the  forest.   Not long  afterwards,  as he ascended  a small  hillock, he  saw at  its foot  a Lion  feeding on  the Calf. Terrified at the sight,  he lifted his eyes  and his hands to  heaven, and said: &quot;Just now I vowed  to offer a lamb  to the Guardian Deities  of the forest if  I could only find out who had robbed me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a full-grown Bull to  the Calf I have lost, if I may  only secure my own escape from him in safety.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hare and the Tortoise</p>
<p>A HARE  one day  ridiculed the  short feet  and slow  pace of  the Tortoise, who replied, laughing:   &quot;Though you  be swift  as the  wind, I  will beat  you in a race.&quot;  The Hare, believing her  assertion to be simply impossible,  assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix  the goal.  On the day appointed for the race the two started together.  The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight  to the end of the  course. The Hare, lying  down by the wayside,  fell fast asleep. At last  waking up,  and moving  as fast  as he  could, he  saw the Tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.</p>
<p>Slow but steady wins the race.</p>
<p>The Pomegranate, Apple-Tree, and Bramble</p>
<p>THE POMEGRANATE  and Apple-Tree  disputed as  to which  was the  most beautiful. When their strife was at its height, a Bramble from the neighboring hedge lifted up its  voice, and  said in  a boastful  tone:  &quot;Pray,  my dear  friends, in  my presence at least cease from such vain disputings.&quot;</p>
<p>The Farmer and the Stork</p>
<p>A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number of  Cranes, which came to pick up his seed.  With them he trapped a Stork that had fractured his leg in the  net and was earnestly  beseeching the Farmer to  spare his life. &quot;Pray save me, Master,&quot; he said, &quot;and let me go free this once.  My broken  limb should excite  your pity.   Besides, I  am no  Crane, I  am a  Stork, a  bird of excellent character;  and see  how I  love and  slave for  my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers-- they are not the least like those of a Crane.&quot;    The Farmer laughed aloud and said, &quot;It may be  all as you say, I only know this:   I have  taken you  with these  robbers, the  Cranes, and  you must  die in  their company.&quot;</p>
<p>Birds of a feather flock together.</p>
<p>The Farmer and the Snake</p>
<p>ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold.  He had compassion on it, and taking it up, placed  it in his bosom. The Snake was  quickly revived by  the  warmth,  and  resuming  its  natural  instincts,  bit  its  benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound.  &quot;Oh,&quot; cried the Farmer with his last  breath, &quot;I am rightly served for pitying a scoundrel.&quot;</p>
<p>The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.</p>
<p>The Fawn and His Mother</p>
<p>A YOUNG FAWN once said to his  Mother, &quot;You are larger than a dog,  and swifter, and more used  to running, and  you have your  horns as a  defense; why, then, O Mother! do  the hounds  frighten you  so?&quot; She  smiled, and  said:  &quot;I know full well, my son, that all you say is true.  I have the advantages you mention,  but when I hear even the bark of a single dog I feel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can.&quot;</p>
<p>No arguments will give courage to the coward.</p>
<p>The Bear and the Fox</p>
<p>A BEAR boasted very much of his philanthropy, saying that of all animals he  was the most tender in his regard for man,  for he had such respect for him that  he would not even touch his dead body. A Fox hearing these words said with a  smile to the Bear, &quot;Oh! that you would eat the dead and not the living.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swallow and the Crow</p>
<p>THE SWALLOW and the Crow had a  contention about their plumage. The Crow put  an end to the dispute  by saying, &quot;Your feathers  are all very well  in the spring, but mine protect me against the winter.&quot;</p>
<p>Fair weather friends are not worth much.</p>
<p>The Mountain in Labor</p>
<p>A MOUNTAIN was once  greatly agitated.  Loud groans  and noises were heard,  and crowds of people  came from all  parts to see  what was the  matter.  While they were assembled  in anxious  expectation of  some terrible  calamity, out  came a Mouse.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t make much ado about nothing.</p>
<p>The Ass, the Fox, and the Lion</p>
<p>THE ASS and the Fox, having  entered into partnership together for their  mutual protection, went out into the forest  to hunt.  They had not proceeded  far when they met  a Lion.   The Fox,  seeing imminent  danger, approached  the Lion  and promised to contrive for him the capture of the Ass if the Lion would pledge his word not to  harm the Fox.   Then, upon assuring  the Ass that  he would not  be injured, the Fox led him to a deep pit and arranged that he should fall into it. The Lion, seeing  that the Ass  was secured, immediately  clutched the Fox,  and attacked the Ass at his leisure.</p>
<p>The Tortoise and the Eagle</p>
<p>A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the  sun, complained to the sea-birds of  her hard fate, that no  one would teach  her to fly.  An Eagle, hovering  near, heard her lamentation and demanded  what reward she  would give him  if he would  take her aloft and float her in the air.  &quot;I will give you,&quot; she said, &quot;all the riches of the Red Sea.&quot;  &quot;I will teach you to fly then,&quot; said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried  her almost to the clouds  suddenly he let her go,  and she  fell  on a  lofty  mountain, dashing  her  shell to  pieces.   The Tortoise exclaimed in the moment  of death:  &quot;I have  deserved my present fate;  for what had I to  do with wings  and clouds, who  can with difficulty  move about on the earth?&#x27;</p>
<p>If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined.</p>
<p>The Flies and the Honey-Pot</p>
<p>A NUMBER of Flies were attracted to a jar of honey which had been overturned  in a housekeeper&#x27;s room, and placing their  feet in it, ate greedily.  Their  feet, however, became so smeared with the  honey that they could not use  their wings, nor release themselves, and were  suffocated.  Just as they were  expiring, they exclaimed, &quot;O foolish creatures that we  are, for the sake of a  little pleasure we have destroyed ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Pleasure bought with pains, hurts.</p>
<p>The Man and the Lion</p>
<p>A MAN and a Lion traveled together through the forest.  They soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in strength and prowess.  As  they were disputing, they passed a statue carved in stone, which represented &quot;a  Lion strangled by  a Man.&quot;   The traveler  pointed to  it and  said:  &quot;See there! How strong we  are, and  how we  prevail over  even the  king of  beasts.&quot;  The Lion replied:  &quot;This statue  was made by  one of you  men.  If we  Lions knew how  to erect statues, you would see the Man placed under the paw of the Lion.&quot;</p>
<p>One story is good, till another is told.</p>
<p>The Farmer and the Cranes</p>
<p>SOME CRANES made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with  wheat. For a long time the Farmer, brandishing an empty sling, chased them away by  the terror he inspired; but  when the birds found  that the sling was  only swung in the air, they ceased to take any  notice of it and would not move.   The Farmer, on seeing this, charged his sling  with stones, and killed a great  number.  The remaining birds at once  forsook his fields, crying  to each other, &quot;It  is time for us to be off to Liliput:  for this man is no longer content to scare us, but begins to show us in earnest what he can do.&quot;</p>
<p>If words suffice not, blows must follow.</p>
<p>The Dog in the Manger</p>
<p>A DOG lay in a manger, and by his growling and snapping prevented the oxen  from eating the hay which had been placed  for them. &quot;What a selfish Dog!&quot;  said  one of them to his  companions; &quot;he cannot eat  the hay himself, and  yet refuses to allow those to eat who can.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Goat</p>
<p>A FOX one day fell into a deep well and could find no means of escape.  A  Goat, overcome with thirst, came to the same well, and seeing the Fox, inquired if the water was good.  Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Fox indulged in a lavish  praise of the  water, saying it  was excellent beyond  measure, and encouraging him to descend.  The Goat, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank,  the Fox informed him of the difficulty  they were both in  and suggested a  scheme for their  common escape.  &quot;If,&quot;  said he, &quot;you will place your forefeet  upon the wall and bend  your head, I will run  up your back  and escape,  and will  help you  out afterwards.&quot;   The Goat  readily assented and the Fox  leaped upon his back.   Steadying himself with the  Goat&#x27;s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could. When the Goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, &quot;You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up,  nor have  exposed yourself  to dangers  from which  you had no means of escape.&quot;</p>
<p>Look before you leap.</p>
<p>The Bear and the Two Travelers</p>
<p>TWO MEN were traveling  together, when a Bear  suddenly met them on  their path. One  of  them climbed  up  quickly into  a  tree and  concealed  himself in  the branches.  The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the  ground, and when the Bear came up and felt  him with his snout, and smelt him all  over, he held his  breath, and feigned  the appearance of  death as much  as he could. The Bear soon left him, for it is  said he will not touch a dead body.   When he was  quite gone,  the other  Traveler descended  from the  tree, and  jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Bear had whispered in his ear.  &quot;He  gave me this advice,&quot; his companion replied.  &quot;Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.&quot;</p>
<p>Misfortune tests the sincerity of friends.</p>
<p>The Oxen and the Axle-Trees</p>
<p>A HEAVY WAGON  was being dragged  along a country  lane by a  team of Oxen.  The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels:  &quot;Hullo there! why do you make so much noise? We bear  all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out.&quot;</p>
<p>Those who suffer most cry out the least.</p>
<p>The Thirsty Pigeon</p>
<p>A PIGEON,  oppressed by  excessive thirst,  saw a  goblet of  water painted on a signboard.  Not supposing it  to be only a  picture, she flew towards  it with a loud  whir  and  unwittingly  dashed  against  the  signboard,  jarring  herself terribly.  Having broken her wings by the blow, she fell to the ground, and  was caught by one of the bystanders.</p>
<p>Zeal should not outrun discretion.</p>
<p>The Raven and the Swan</p>
<p>A RAVEN saw a Swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful plumage. Supposing that the  Swan&#x27;s splendid white  color arose from  his washing in  the water in which he swam, the Raven  left the altars in the neighborhood where  he picked  up his  living, and  took up  residence in  the lakes  and pools.   But cleansing his feathers as  often as he would,  he could not change  their color, while through want of food he perished.</p>
<p>Change of habit cannot alter Nature.</p>
<p>The Goat and the Goatherd</p>
<p>A GOATHERD had sought to bring back  a stray goat to his flock. He  whistled and sounded his horn in  vain; the straggler paid  no attention to the  summons.  At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and  breaking its horn, begged the Goat not  to tell his master. The Goat replied,  &quot;Why, you silly fellow, the horn  will speak though I be silent.&quot;</p>
<p>Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid.</p>
<p>The Miser</p>
<p>A MISER sold all  that he had and  bought a lump of  gold, which he buried  in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily.  One of his workmen observed his  frequent visits to the  spot and decided to  watch his movements.  He soon  discovered the secret  of the hidden  treasure, and digging down, came to  the lump of  gold, and stole  it.  The Miser,  on his next visit, found the hole empty and began to  tear his hair and to make loud  lamentations. A neighbor, seeing him overcome with  grief and learning the cause, said,  &quot;Pray do not grieve so; but go and take  a stone, and place it in the hole,  and fancy that the gold is still lying there.  It will do you quite the same service;  for when the gold was there, you had it  not, as you did not make the slightest  use of it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sick Lion</p>
<p>A LION,  unable from  old age  and infirmities  to provide  himself with food by force, resolved to do  so by artifice.  He  returned to his den,  and lying down there, pretended to be  sick, taking care that  his sickness should be  publicly known.  The beasts expressed their sorrow, and came one by one to his den, where the Lion devoured them.  After many of the beasts had thus disappeared, the  Fox discovered the trick and presenting himself to the Lion, stood on the outside of the cave,  at a  respectful distance,  and asked  him how  he was.   &quot;I am  very middling,&quot; replied the Lion, &quot;but why do you stand without? Pray enter within to talk with me.&quot;  &quot;No,  thank you,&quot; said the  Fox.  &quot;I notice that  there are many prints of feet entering your cave, but I see no trace of any returning.&quot;</p>
<p>He is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others.</p>
<p>The Horse and Groom</p>
<p>A GROOM used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his Horse, but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit.  &quot;Alas!&quot;  said the Horse, &quot;if you really wish me  to be in good condition, you should  groom me less, and feed me more.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ass and the Lapdog</p>
<p>A MAN had an Ass, and a Maltese  Lapdog, a very great beauty.  The Ass was  left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat, just as any other Ass  would. The Lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master, who  often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat.  The Ass, on  the contrary, had much  work to do in  grinding the corn-mill and  in carrying  wood from  the forest  or burdens  from the  farm.  He  often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the Lapdog, till at last  one day he broke  his cords and halter,  and galloped into his  master&#x27;s house,  kicking up  his heels  without measure,  and frisking  and fawning as well as he could.  He next  tried to jump about his master as he  had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms.  He then  attempted to lick  his master, and  jumped upon his  back.  The servants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their  master, quickly relieved him, and drove out the  Ass to his stable with kicks and  clubs and cuffs.  The Ass,  as he returned to  his stall beaten nearly  to death, thus lamented:  &quot;I have brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to labor  with my  companions, and  not wish  to be  idle all  the day like that useless little Lapdog!&quot;</p>
<p>The Lioness</p>
<p>A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute.  &quot;And you,&quot; they  said, &quot;how many sons have you at  a birth?&#x27;  The Lioness laughed at them, and said: &quot;Why! I have only one; but  that one is altogether a thoroughbred Lion.&quot;</p>
<p>The value is in the worth, not in the number.</p>
<p>The Boasting Traveler</p>
<p>A MAN who had traveled in foreign  lands boasted very much, on returning to  his own country,  of the  many wonderful  and heroic  feats he  had performed in the different places he had visited. Among other things, he said that when he was at Rhodes he  had leaped  to such  a distance  that no  man of  his day  could leap anywhere near him as to that, there  were in Rhodes many persons who saw  him do it and whom he could call as witnesses.  One of the bystanders interrupted  him, saying:  &quot;Now, my good man, if this  be all true there is no need  of witnesses. Suppose this to be Rhodes, and leap for us.&quot;</p>
<p>The Cat and the Cock</p>
<p>A CAT  caught a  Cock, and  pondered how  he might  find a reasonable excuse for eating  him.  He  accused him  of being  a nuisance  to men  by crowing  in the nighttime and not permitting them to sleep. The Cock defended himself by  saying that he did this for the benefit of men, that they might rise in time for  their labors. The Cat replied, &quot;Although you abound in specious apologies, I shall not remain supperless&quot;; and he made a meal of him.</p>
<p>The Piglet, the Sheep, and the Goat</p>
<p>A YOUNG PIG was shut up in a fold-yard with a Goat and a Sheep. On one  occasion when  the  shepherd laid  hold  of him,  he  grunted and  squeaked  and resisted violently.  The Sheep and the Goat complained of his distressing cries,  saying, &quot;He often handles us, and  we do not cry out.&quot;   To this the Pig replied,  &quot;Your handling and mine are very different things.  He catches you only for your wool, or your milk, but he lays hold on me for my very life.&quot;</p>
<p>The Boy and the Filberts</p>
<p>A BOY put his hand  into a pitcher full of  filberts.  He grasped as many  as he could possibly hold, but  when he tried to  pull out his hand,  he was prevented from doing so by the neck of  the pitcher.  Unwilling to lose his filberts,  and yet unable to withdraw his hand,  he burst into tears and bitterly  lamented his disappointment.  A bystander said to him, &quot;Be satisfied with half the  quantity, and you will readily draw out your hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Do not attempt too much at once.</p>
<p>The Lion in Love</p>
<p>A LION demanded the daughter of a woodcutter in marriage.  The Father, unwilling to grant, and yet afraid to refuse  his request, hit upon this expedient to  rid himself of his importunities.  He  expressed his willingness to accept  the Lion as the suitor  of his daughter  on one condition:   that he should  allow him to extract his teeth, and cut off  his claws, as his daughter was  fearfully afraid of both.  The Lion cheerfully assented to the proposal. But when the  toothless, clawless Lion returned to repeat his request, the Woodman, no longer afraid, set upon him with his club, and drove him away into the forest.</p>
<p>The Laborer and the Snake</p>
<p>A SNAKE,  having made  his hole  close to  the porch  of a  cottage, inflicted a mortal bite on the  Cottager&#x27;s infant son.  Grieving  over his loss, the  Father resolved to kill  the Snake.  The  next day, when  it came out  of its hole  for food, he took up his axe, but  by swinging too hastily, missed its head  and cut off only the  end of its  tail.  After some  time the Cottager,  afraid that the Snake would bite him also, endeavored  to make peace, and placed some  bread and salt in the hole.  The Snake, slightly hissing, said:  &quot;There can henceforth  be no peace between  us; for whenever  I see you  I shall remember  the loss of  my tail, and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son.&quot;</p>
<p>No one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the injury.</p>
<p>The Wolf in Sheep&#x27;s Clothing</p>
<p>ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved  to disguise his appearance in order to  secure food more easily.  Encased  in the skin of  a sheep, he pastured  with the flock deceiving the shepherd  by his costume.   In the evening  he was shut  up by the shepherd in  the fold;  the gate  was closed,  and the  entrance made thoroughly secure.  But the shepherd, returning to the fold during the night to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly caught up  the Wolf instead of a sheep, and  killed him instantly.</p>
<p>Harm seek.  harm find.</p>
<p>The Ass and the Mule</p>
<p>A MULETEER set forth on  a journey, driving before him  an Ass and a Mule,  both well laden.  The Ass, as long as  he traveled along the plain, carried his  load with ease, but when he began to ascend the steep path of the mountain, felt  his load to be more than he could  bear.  He entreated his companion to relieve  him of a small  portion, that he  might carry home  the rest; but  the Mule paid  no attention to the request.  The Ass  shortly afterwards fell down dead under  his burden.  Not knowing what  else to do in  so wild a region,  the Muleteer placed upon the Mule the load carried by the Ass in addition to his own, and at the top of all placed the hide of the Ass, after he had skinned him.  The Mule, groaning beneath  his heavy  burden, said  to himself:   &quot;I am  treated according  to my deserts.  If I had only been willing to  assist the Ass a little in his need,  I should not now be bearing, together with his burden, himself as well.&quot;</p>
<p>The Frogs Asking for a King</p>
<p>THE FROGS, grieved at having  no established Ruler, sent ambassadors  to Jupiter entreating for a  King.  Perceiving their  simplicity, he cast  down a huge  log into the lake.  The  Frogs were terrified at  the splash occasioned by  its fall and hid themselves in the depths of the pool.  But as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless, they swam again to the top of the water,  dismissed their fears, climbed up, and began squatting on it in contempt.  After some time they began  to think  themselves ill-treated  in the  appointment of  so inert a Ruler, and sent a  second deputation to Jupiter  to pray that he  would set over them another  sovereign.  He  then gave  them an  Eel to  govern them.  When the Frogs discovered his easy good nature, they sent yet a third time to Jupiter  to beg him to  choose for them  still another King.   Jupiter, displeased with  all their complaints, sent a Heron, who preyed upon the Frogs day by day till  there were none left to croak upon the lake.</p>
<p>The Boys and the Frogs</p>
<p>SOME BOYS, playing near a pond, saw a number of Frogs in the water and began  to pelt them  with stones.   They killed  several of  them, when  one of the Frogs, lifting his head  out of the  water, cried out:   &quot;Pray stop, my  boys:  what is sport to you, is death to us.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sick Stag</p>
<p>A SICK STAG  lay down in  a quiet corner  of its pasture-ground.  His companions came in great numbers to inquire  after his health, and each one  helped himself to a share of the food which had  been placed for his use; so that he  died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of the means of living.</p>
<p>Evil companions bring more hurt than profit.</p>
<p>The Salt Merchant and His Ass</p>
<p>A PEDDLER drove his Ass to the seashore to buy salt.  His road home lay across a stream into which  his Ass, making  a false step,  fell by accident  and rose up again with his  load considerably lighter,  as the water  melted the sack.   The Peddler retraced his steps and refilled  his panniers with a larger quantity  of salt than  before.  When  he came  again to  the stream,  the Ass  fell down  on purpose in the same  spot, and, regaining his  feet with the weight  of his load much diminished, brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired.  The Peddler saw through  his trick and  drove him for  the third time  to the coast, where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt.  The Ass, again playing  the fool, fell down on  purpose when he reached  the stream, but the  sponges became swollen with water, greatly increasing his load. And thus his trick recoiled  on him, for he now carried on his back a double burden.</p>
<p>The Oxen and the Butchers</p>
<p>THE OXEN once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, who practiced a  trade destructive to their race.  They assembled  on a certain day to carry  out their purpose, and sharpened  their horns for  the contest.  But  one of them  who was exceedingly old (for many a field  had he plowed) thus spoke:  &quot;These  Butchers, it is  true, slaughter  us, but  they do  so with  skillful hands,  and with  no unnecessary pain.   If we  get rid  of them,  we shall  fall into  the hands  of unskillful operators, and thus suffer a  double death:  for you may be  assured, that though all the Butchers should perish, yet will men never want beef.&quot;</p>
<p>Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another.</p>
<p>The Lion, the Mouse, and the Fox</p>
<p>A LION, fatigued by the heat of a summer&#x27;s day, fell fast asleep in his den.   A Mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers.  He rose up and shook himself in great wrath, and searched  every corner of his den to find  the Mouse.  A Fox  seeing him said:   &quot;A fine Lion  you are, to  be frightened of  a Mouse.&quot; &quot;&#x27;Tis not the  Mouse I fear,&quot; said  the Lion; &quot;I resent  his familiarity and ill-breeding.&quot;</p>
<p>Little liberties are great offenses.</p>
<p>The Vain Jackdaw</p>
<p>JUPITER DETERMINED, it is said, to  create a sovereign over the birds,  and made proclamation that  on a  certain day  they should  all present themselves before him, when he would himself choose the most beautiful among them to be king.  The Jackdaw, knowing his  own ugliness, searched  through the woods  and fields, and collected the feathers which  had fallen from the  wings of his companions,  and stuck them in  all parts of  his body, hoping  thereby to make  himself the most beautiful of all.  When the appointed  day arrived, and the birds had  assembled before  Jupiter, the  Jackdaw also  made his  appearance in  his many  feathered finery.  But when Jupiter proposed to make him king because of the beauty of his plumage, the  birds indignantly  protested, and  each plucked  from him  his own feathers, leaving the Jackdaw nothing but a Jackdaw.</p>
<p>The Goatherd and the Wild Goats</p>
<p>A GOATHERD, driving his  flock from their pasture  at eventide, found some  Wild Goats mingled among them, and shut them up together with his own for the  night. The next day it snowed  very hard, so that he  could not take the herd  to their usual feeding places, but was obliged to keep them in the fold.  He gave his own goats  just sufficient  food to  keep them  alive, but  fed the  strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them  his own.  When the  thaw set in,  he led them  all out to  feed, and the  Wild Goats scampered away as  fast as they  could to the  mountains.  The Goatherd  scolded them for their ingratitude  in leaving him, when  during the storm he  had taken more care of  them than of  his own herd.   One of them,  turning about, said to him:  &quot;That  is the  very reason  why we  are so  cautious; for if you yesterday treated us better than the Goats you have had so long, it is plain also that  if others came after us, you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>The Mischievous Dog</p>
<p>A DOG used to run up quietly to  the heels of everyone he met, and to  bite them without notice.   His master  suspended a  bell about  his neck  so that the Dog might give  notice of  his presence  wherever he  went.  Thinking  it a  mark of distinction, the Dog grew  proud of his bell  and went tinkling it  all over the marketplace.   One day  an old  hound said  to him:   Why do  you make  such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that  you carry is not, believe me,  any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of disgrace, a public notice to all men  to avoid you as an ill mannered dog.&quot;</p>
<p>Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.</p>
<p>The Fox Who Had Lost His Tail</p>
<p>A FOX  caught in  a trap  escaped, but  in so  doing lost  his tail. Thereafter, feeling his life a burden from the  shame and ridicule to which he was  exposed, he schemed to  convince all the  other Foxes that  being tailless was  much more attractive, thus making up  for his own deprivation.   He assembled a good  many Foxes and publicly advised them to  cut off their tails, saying that  they would not only  look much  better without  them, but  that they  would get  rid of the weight  of  the  brush, which  was  a  very great  inconvenience.   One  of them interrupting him said, &quot;If you had  not yourself lost your tail, my  friend, you would not thus counsel us.&quot;</p>
<p>The Boy and the Nettles</p>
<p>A BOY was stung by a Nettle.  He ran home and told his Mother, saying, &quot;Although it hurts me very much, I only  touched it gently.&quot;  &quot;That was just why  it stung you,&quot; said his Mother.  &quot;The next time you touch a Nettle, grasp it boldly,  and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and not in the least hurt you.&quot;</p>

<p>The Man and His Two Sweethearts</p>
<p>A MIDDLE-AGED MAN, whose hair had begun  to turn gray, courted two women at  the same time.  One of  them was young, and  the other well advanced  in years.  The elder woman, ashamed to be courted by a man younger than herself, made a  point, whenever her admirer visited her, to  pull out some portion of his  black hairs. The younger, on the contrary, not wishing to become the wife of an old man,  was equally zealous in  removing every gray  hair she could  find.  Thus it  came to pass that between them both  he very soon found that  he had not a hair  left on his head.</p>

<p>The Astronomer</p>
<p>AN ASTRONOMER used to go out at night to observe the stars.  One evening, as  he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention fixed on the sky, he  fell accidentally into a  deep well.  While  he lamented and  bewailed his sores  and bruises, and cried  loudly for help,  a neighbor ran  to the well,  and learning what had happened said:  &quot;Hark ye, old fellow, why, in striving to pry into what is in heaven, do you not manage to see what is on earth?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Wolves and the Sheep</p>
<p>&quot;WHY SHOULD there always be this fear and slaughter between us?&quot; said the Wolves to the Sheep.  &quot;Those evil-disposed Dogs  have much to answer for.  They  always bark whenever we approach  you and attack us  before we have done  any harm.  If you would only  dismiss them from  your heels, there  might soon be  treaties of peace and  reconciliation between  us.&quot;  The  Sheep, poor  silly creatures, were easily  beguiled and  dismissed the  Dogs, whereupon  the Wolves  destroyed the unguarded flock at their own pleasure.</p>
<p>The Old Woman and the Physician</p>
<p>AN OLD WOMAN  having lost the  use of her  eyes, called in  a Physician to  heal them, and made this bargain with him  in the presence of witnesses:  that if  he should cure her blindness, he should receive from her a sum of money; but if her infirmity remained, she should give him nothing.  This agreement being made, the Physician, time after time,  applied his salve to  her eyes, and on  every visit took something away, stealing  all her property little  by little.  And when  he had got all she had, he healed  her and demanded the promised payment.  The  Old Woman, when  she recovered  her sight  and saw  none of  her goods in her house, would give him nothing.  The Physician insisted on his claim, and.  as she still refused, summoned her before the Judge. The Old Woman, standing up in the Court, argued:  &quot;This man here speaks the truth  in what he says; for I did  promise to give him a sum of money if I should recover my sight:  but if I continued blind, I was to give him nothing.  Now he declares that I am healed.  I on the contrary affirm that I am still blind;  for when I lost the use  of my eyes, I saw in  my house various chattels and valuable goods:  but now, though he swears I am cured of my blindness, I am not able to see a single thing in it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fighting Cocks and the Eagle</p>
<p>TWO GAME COCKS were fiercely fighting  for the mastery of the farmyard.   One at last put the other to flight.  The vanquished Cock skulked away and hid  himself in a quiet corner,  while the conqueror, flying  up to a high  wall, flapped his wings and crowed exultingly  with all his might.   An Eagle sailing through  the air pounced upon  him and carried  him off in  his talons.  The  vanquished Cock immediately  came  out  of  his corner,  and  ruled  henceforth  with undisputed mastery.</p>
<p>Pride goes before destruction.</p>
<p>The Charger and the Miller</p>
<p>A CHARGER, feeling the infirmities of age, was sent to work in a mill instead of going out to battle.  But when he  was compelled to grind instead of serving  in the wars, he bewailed his change of fortune and called to mind his former state, saying, &quot;Ah! Miller,  I had indeed  to go campaigning  before, but I  was barbed from  counter to  tail, and  a man  went along  to groom  me; and  now I  cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the battle.&quot;  &quot;Forbear,&quot; said the Miller to him,  &quot;harping on what was  of yore, for it  is the common lot  of mortals to sustain the ups and downs of fortune.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Monkey</p>
<p>A MONKEY once danced in  an assembly of the Beasts,  and so pleased them all  by his performance that they elected him their King.  A Fox, envying him the honor, discovered a piece of meat lying in a trap, and leading the Monkey to the  place where it was, said that she had found a store, but had not used it, she had kept it for him as treasure  trove of his kingdom, and  counseled him to lay hold  of it.  The Monkey  approached carelessly and  was caught in  the trap; and  on his accusing  the Fox  of purposely  leading him  into the  snare, she  replied, &quot;O Monkey, and  are you,  with such  a mind  as yours,  going to  be King  over the Beasts?&quot;</p>
<p>The Horse and His Rider</p>
<p>A HORSE  SOLDIER took  the utmost  pains with  his charger.   As long as the war lasted, he looked upon him as  his fellow-helper in all emergencies and  fed him carefully with hay  and corn.  But  when the war  was over, he  only allowed him chaff to  eat and  made him  carry heavy  loads of  wood, subjecting him to much slavish drudgery and ill-treatment.  War was again proclaimed, however, and when the trumpet summoned  him to his  standard, the Soldier  put on his  charger its military trappings,  and mounted,  being clad  in his  heavy coat  of mail.  The Horse fell down straightway under the weight, no longer equal to the burden, and said  to  his master,  &quot;You  must now  go  to the  war  on foot,  for  you have transformed me from a Horse into an Ass; and how can you expect that I can again turn in a moment from an Ass to a Horse?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Belly and the Members</p>
<p>THE MEMBERS of the Body rebelled against the Belly, and said, &quot;Why should we  be perpetually engaged  in administering  to your  wants, while  you do nothing but take your rest, and enjoy yourself in luxury and self-indulgence?&#x27;  The  Members carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to the Belly.  The  whole Body quickly became debilitated, and the hands, feet, mouth, and eyes, when  too late, repented of their folly.</p>
<p>The Vine and the Goat</p>
<p>A VINE was  luxuriant in the  time of vintage  with leaves and  grapes.  A Goat, passing by, nibbled its young tendrils  and its leaves.  The Vine addressed  him and said:  &quot;Why do you  thus injure me without a  cause, and crop my leaves?  Is there  no young  grass left?  But I  shall not  have to  wait long  for my  just revenge; for if you  now should crop my  leaves, and cut me  down to my root,  I shall provide the  wine to pour  over you when  you are led  as a victim  to the sacrifice.&quot;</p>
<p>Jupiter and the Monkey</p>
<p>JUPITER ISSUED a  proclamation to all  the beasts of  the forest and  promised a royal reward to the  one whose offspring should  be deemed the handsomest.   The Monkey came with the rest and presented, with all a mother&#x27;s tenderness, a flat nosed,  hairless, ill-featured  young Monkey  as a  candidate for  the promised reward.   A general  laugh saluted  her on  the presentation  of her  son.  She resolutely said, &quot;I know not whether Jupiter will allot the prize to my son, but this I do know, that he is at  least in the eyes of me his mother,  the dearest, handsomest, and most beautiful of all.&quot;</p>
<p>The Widow and Her Little Maidens</p>
<p>A WIDOW who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to wait on her.  She was in the habit  of waking them  early in the  morning, at cockcrow.   The maidens, aggravated by such excessive labor, resolved  to kill the cock who roused  their mistress so  early.  When  they had  done this,  they found  that they  had only prepared for themselves greater troubles, for their mistress, no longer  hearing the hour from the cock, woke them up to their work in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The Shepherd&#x27;s Boy and the Wolf</p>
<p>A SHEPHERD-BOY, who  watched a flock  of sheep near  a village, brought  out the villagers  three  or four  times  by crying  out,  &quot;Wolf! Wolf!&quot;   and  when his neighbors came to help him, laughed at them for their pains.  The Wolf, however, did truly  come at  last. The  Shepherd-boy, now  really alarmed,  shouted in an agony of terror:  &quot;Pray,  do come and help  me; the Wolf is  killing the sheep&quot;; but no one paid any heed to  his cries, nor rendered any assistance.  The  Wolf, having no cause of fear, at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock.</p>
<p>There is no believing a liar, even when he speaks the truth.</p>
<p>The Cat and the Birds</p>
<p>A CAT, hearing that the Birds in a certain aviary were ailing dressed himself up as a  physician, and,  taking his  cane and  a bag  of instruments  becoming his profession, went to call  on them.  He knocked  at the door and  inquired of the inmates how they  all did, saying  that if they  were ill, he  would be happy to prescribe for  them and  cure them.   They replied,  &quot;We are  all very well, and shall continue so, if you will only be  good enough to go away, and leave us  as we are.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kid and the Wolf</p>
<p>A KID standing on the roof of a house, out of harm&#x27;s way, saw a Wolf passing  by and immediately  began to  taunt and  revile him.  The Wolf,  looking up,  said, &quot;Sirrah! I hear thee:  yet it is not thou who mockest me, but the roof on  which thou art standing.&quot;</p>

<p>The Ox and the Frog</p>
<p>AN OX drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and crushed one of  them to death.  The Mother  coming up, and missing  one of her sons,  inquired of his brothers what had become of him. &quot;He  is dead, dear Mother; for just now  a very huge beast with four great feet came  to the pool and crushed him to  death with his cloven heel.&quot;  The Frog, puffing herself out, inquired, &quot;if the beast was as big as that in size.&quot;  &quot;Cease, Mother, to puff yourself out,&quot; said her son, &quot;and do not be  angry; for you  would, I assure  you, sooner burst  than successfully imitate the hugeness of that monster.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shepherd and the Wolf</p>
<p>A SHEPHERD once found the whelp of a Wolf and brought it up, and after a  while  taught it to steal lambs from  the neighboring flocks.  The Wolf, having  shown  himself an apt pupil, said to the Shepherd, &quot;Since you have taught me to steal,  you must keep a sharp lookout, or you will lose some of your own flock.&quot;</p>
<p>The Father and His Two Daughters</p>
<p>A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the other to a tile maker.  After a time he went to  the daughter who had married the gardener,  and inquired how she was  and how all things  went with her.  She  said, &quot;All things are prospering with me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of rain, in order that the plants may be well watered.&quot;  Not long after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and likewise inquired of her  how she fared; she replied,  &quot;I want for nothing,  and have only one  wish, that the dry weather may continue, and the sun  shine hot and bright, so that the  bricks might be dried.&quot;  He said to her,  &quot;If your sister wishes for rain, and  you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my wishes?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Farmer and His Sons</p>
<p>A FATHER, being  on the point  of death, wished  to be sure  that his sons would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had given it.  He called  them to his bedside and said,  &quot;My sons, there is a  great treasure hid in one  of my vineyards.&quot;   The sons,  after his  death, took  their spades  and mattocks  and carefully dug over every portion of their land.  They found no treasure, but the vines repaid their labor by an extraordinary and superabundant crop.</p>
<p>The Crab and Its Mother</p>
<p>A CRAB said to her son, &quot;Why do you walk so one-sided, my child? It is far  more becoming to go  straight forward.&quot;  The  young Crab replied:   &quot;Quite true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the straight way, I will promise to walk in it.&quot; The Mother tried in vain, and  submitted without remonstrance to the reproof  of her child.</p>
<p>Example is more powerful than precept.</p>
<p>The Heifer and the Ox</p>
<p>A HEIFER saw  an Ox hard  at work harnessed  to a plow,  and tormented him  with reflections  on  his  unhappy  fate  in  being  compelled  to  labor.    Shortly afterwards, at the harvest  festival, the owner released  the Ox from his  yoke, but bound the Heifer  with cords and led  him away to the  altar to be slain  in honor of the occasion.  The Ox saw what was being done, and said with a smile to the Heifer:  &quot;For this  you were allowed to  live in idleness, because  you were presently to be sacrificed.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swallow, the Serpent, and the Court of Justice</p>
<p>A SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling with men, built herself a nest in the wall of  a Court of Justice and there hatched  seven young birds.  A Serpent  gliding past the  nest from its  hole in the  wall ate up the young  unfledged  nestlings.   The Swallow,  finding  her  nest empty,  lamented greatly and  exclaimed:  &quot;Woe  to me  a stranger!  that in  this place where all others&#x27; rights are protected, I alone should suffer wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>The Thief and His Mother</p>
<p>A BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and took it home to  his Mother.  She not only abstained from  beating him, but encouraged him.  He  next time stole  a cloak  and brought  it to  her, and  she again commended him.  The Youth, advanced to adulthood, proceeded to steal things of still greater  value. At last he was caught  in the very act, and  having his hands bound behind  him, was led away to the place of public execution.  His Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in  sorrow, whereupon the young man said,  &quot;I wish to say  something to  my Mother  in her  ear.&quot;  She  came close  to him,  and he quickly seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off.  The Mother upbraided  him as an  unnatural child,  whereon he  replied, &quot;Ah!  if you  had beaten me when I first stole and brought to you that lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have been thus led to a disgraceful death.&quot;</p>
<p>The Old Man and Death</p>
<p>AN OLD  MAN was  employed in  cutting wood  in the  forest, and, in carrying the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very wearied with his long journey. He sat  down by  the wayside,  and throwing  down his  load, besought &quot;Death&quot; to come.  &quot;Death&quot; immediately appeared in answer to his summons and asked for  what reason he had called him.  The Old Man hurriedly replied, &quot;That, lifting up  the load, you may place it again upon my shoulders.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fir-Tree and the Bramble</p>
<p>A FIR-TREE said boastingly to the  Bramble, &quot;You are useful for nothing  at all; while I am everywhere  used for roofs and  houses.&quot; The Bramble answered:   &#x27;You poor creature, if you would only call to mind the axes and saws which are  about to hew you down, you would have reason to wish that you had grown up a  Bramble, not a Fir-Tree.&quot;</p>
<p>Better poverty without care, than riches with.</p>
<p>The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk</p>
<p>A MOUSE who always  lived on the land,  by an unlucky chance  formed an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for  the most part in the water.  The  Frog, one day  intent on  mischief, bound  the foot  of the  Mouse tightly to his own. Thus joined  together, the  Frog first  of all  led his  friend the Mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their food.  After this, he  gradually led him towards the  pool in which he  lived, until reaching the  very brink, he suddenly jumped in,  dragging the Mouse  with him.  The  Frog enjoyed the  water amazingly, and swam croaking about, as if he had done a good deed.  The  unhappy Mouse was soon suffocated by the water,  and his dead body floated about on  the surface, tied to the foot of the  Frog.  A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing  upon it with his talons, carried it aloft.  The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.</p>

<p>The Man Bitten by a Dog</p>
<p>A MAN who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of someone who might heal him.  A friend, meeting him and learning what he wanted, said, &quot;If you would  be cured, take a piece of  bread, and dip it in  the blood from your wound,  and go and give it to the  Dog that bit you.&quot;  The  Man who had been bitten  laughed at this advice and said, &quot;Why?  If I should do so,  it would be as if  I should beg every Dog in the town to bite me.&quot;</p>
<p>Benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed increase their means of injuring you.</p>
<p>The Two Pots</p>
<p>A RIVER carried  down in its  stream two Pots,  one made of  earthenware and the other of brass.  The Earthen Pot said to the Brass Pot, &quot;Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me, for if you touch me ever so slightly, I shall be broken in pieces, and besides, I by no means wish to come near you.&quot;</p>
<p>Equals make the best friends.</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Sheep</p>
<p>A WOLF,  sorely wounded  and bitten  by dogs,  lay sick  and maimed in his lair. Being in want of food,  he called to a Sheep  who was passing, and asked  him to fetch some water from  a stream flowing close  beside him.  &quot;For,&quot; he  said, &quot;if you will bring me drink, I will find means to provide myself with meat.&quot;  &quot;Yes,&quot; said the Sheep, &quot;if I should bring you the draught, you would doubtless make  me provide the meat also.&quot;</p>
<p>Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through.</p>
<p>The Aethiop</p>
<p>THE PURCHASER of a black servant was persuaded that the color of his skin  arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his former masters.  On bringing him home he resorted to every means of cleaning, and subjected the man to  incessant scrubbings.  The servant caught a severe cold, but he never changed his color or complexion.</p>

<p>The Fisherman and His Nets</p>
<p>A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful cast and captured  a great haul of fish.  He managed by a skillful handling of his net to retain  all the large  fish and  to draw  them to  the shore;  but he  could not prevent the smaller fish from falling back through the meshes of the net into the sea.</p>
<p>The Huntsman and the Fisherman</p>
<p>A HUNTSMAN, returning  with his dogs  from the field,  fell in by  chance with a Fisherman who was  bringing home a  basket well laden  with fish.  The  Huntsman wished to have the  fish, and their owner  experienced an equal longing  for the contents of the game-bag. They quickly  agreed to exchange the produce of  their day&#x27;s sport. Each was so well pleased  with his bargain that they made for  some time the same exchange day after day.  Finally a neighbor said to them, &quot;If  you go on in this way,  you will soon destroy by  frequent use the pleasure of  your exchange, and each will again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport.&quot;</p>
<p>Abstain and enjoy.</p>
<p>The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar</p>
<p>AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime old wine and which still retained  the fragrant smell  of its former  contents.  She greedily placed it several times to her nose, and drawing it backwards and forwards said, &quot;O most  delicious! How  nice must  the Wine  itself have  been, when  it leaves behind in the very vessel which contained it so sweet a perfume!&quot;</p>
<p>The memory of a good deed lives.</p>
<p>The Fox and the Crow</p>
<p>A CROW having stolen a bit of meat,  perched in a tree and held it in  her beak. A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat himself, and by a wily  stratagem succeeded.  &quot;How handsome is the Crow,&quot; he exclaimed, in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion!  Oh, if her voice were only equal  to her beauty, she would deservedly  be considered the Queen  of Birds!&quot;  This he  said deceitfully; but the Crow, anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw and dropped the flesh.  The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus addressed the Crow:  &quot;My good Crow, your voice is right enough, but your wit  is wanting.&quot;</p>
<p>The Two Dogs</p>
<p>A  MAN had  two dogs:   a Hound,  trained to  assist him  in his  sports, and  a Housedog, taught to watch the house.   When he returned home after a  good day&#x27;s sport, he  always gave  the Housedog  a large  share of  his spoil.   The Hound, feeling much aggrieved  at this, reproached  his companion, saying,  &quot;It is very hard  to have  all this  labor, while  you, who  do not  assist in  the chase, luxuriate on the fruits of my  exertions.&quot;  The Housedog replied, &quot;Do not  blame me, my friend, but find fault with  the master, who has not taught me  to labor, but to depend for subsistence on the labor of others.&quot;</p>
<p>Children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents.</p>
<p>The Stag in the Ox-Stall</p>
<p>A STAG, roundly chased by  the hounds and blinded by  fear to the danger he  was running into, took  shelter in a  farmyard and hid  himself in a  shed among the oxen.  An Ox gave him this kindly warning:  &quot;O unhappy creature! why should  you thus, of your own accord, incur  destruction and trust yourself in the  house of your enemy?&#x27;  The Stag replied:  &quot;Only allow me, friend, to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape.&quot;  At the approach of the  evening the herdsman came  to feed his cattle,  but did not see the Stag; and even the farm-bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and failed to notice him.  The Stag, congratulating himself on his  safety, began to express his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly helped him in the hour of need.  One  of them again answered  him:  &quot;We indeed wish  you well, but the danger is not over.   There is one other yet  to pass through the shed,  who has as it  were a hundred  eyes, and until  he has come  and gone, your  life is still in peril.&quot;  At that moment  the master himself entered, and having  had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to their racks  and cried out:  &quot;Why is  there such a scarcity  of fodder? There is  not half enough straw for them to  lie on.  Those lazy  fellows have not even  swept the cobwebs away.&quot;  While  he thus  examined everything  in turn,  he spied  the tips of the antlers of the Stag peeping out  of the straw.  Then summoning his  laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be seized and killed.</p>
<p>The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons</p>
<p>THE PIGEONS,  terrified by  the appearance  of a  Kite, called  upon the Hawk to defend them.  He at once consented.   When they had admitted him into  the cote, they found that he made more havoc and  slew a larger number of them in one  day than the Kite could pounce upon in a whole year.</p>

<p>The Widow and the Sheep</p>
<p>A CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep.  At shearing time, wishing to  take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared him herself, but used the shears so unskillfully that with  the fleece she  sheared the flesh.   The Sheep, writhing with pain, said, &quot;Why do you hurt me so, Mistress? What weight can my blood  add to the wool? If you want my flesh, there is the butcher, who will kill me in  an instant; but  if you  want my  fleece and  wool, there  is the shearer, who will shear and not hurt me.&quot;</p>
<p>The least outlay is not always the greatest gain.</p>
<p>The Wild Ass and the Lion</p>
<p>A WILD ASS and a  Lion entered into an alliance  so that they might capture  the beasts of the forest with greater ease.  The Lion agreed to assist the Wild  Ass with his strength, while the Wild Ass  gave the Lion the benefit of his  greater speed.  When they had  taken as many beasts  as their necessities required,  the Lion undertook  to distribute  the prey,  and for  this purpose  divided it into three shares.  &quot;I will take the first share,&quot; he said, &quot;because I am King:   and the second  share, as  a partner  with you  in the  chase:  and  the third share (believe me) will be a source of great evil to you, unless you willingly  resign it to me, and set off as fast as you can.&quot;</p>
<p>Might makes right.</p>
<p>The Eagle and the Arrow</p>
<p>AN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare whom he sought to make his prey.  An archer, who saw  the Eagle from a place of concealment,  took an accurate aim and wounded him mortally.  The Eagle gave one look at the  arrow that had entered his heart and saw  in that single glance that its feathers  had been furnished by himself.  &quot;It is a double grief to me,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;that  I should perish by an arrow feathered from my own wings.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sick Kite</p>
<p>A KITE, sick unto death,  said to his mother:  &quot;O  Mother! do not mourn, but  at once invoke the  gods that my  life may be  prolonged.&quot;  She replied,  &quot;Alas! my son, which of the gods  do you think will pity  you? Is there one whom  you have not outraged by filching from their very altars a part of the sacrifice  offered up to them?&#x27;</p>
<p>We must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help in adversity.</p>
<p>The Lion and the Dolphin</p>
<p>A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head out of the  waves, and suggested that  they contract an  alliance, saying that  of all the  animals they ought to be the best friends, since  the one was the king of beasts on  the earth, and  the other  was the  sovereign ruler  of all  the inhabitants  of the ocean.  The Dolphin gladly consented  to this request.  Not long  afterwards the Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin to help him.   The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means reach the  land.  The Lion abused him as a  traitor.  The Dolphin replied, &quot;Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which, while  giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me the power of living upon  the land.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion and the Boar</p>
<p>ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general thirst among the  beasts, a Lion  and a  Boar came  at the  same moment  to a  small well  to drink.  They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal  combat.  When they stopped  suddenly to catch their  breath for  a fiercer  renewal of  the fight,  they saw  some Vultures  waiting in  the distance to feast on the one that should fall first.  They at once made up their quarrel, saying, &quot;It is better for us  to make friends, than to become the  food of Crows or Vultures.&quot;</p>
<p>The One-Eyed Doe</p>
<p>A DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the edge of the  cliff as she possibly could, in the  hope of securing her greater safety.   She turned her sound eye towards  the land that she  might get the earliest  tidings of the approach of hunter or  hound, and her injured  eye towards the sea,  from whence she entertained no anticipation of danger.  Some boatmen sailing by saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her. Yielding up her last breath,  she gasped  forth  this  lament:  &quot;O  wretched  creature  that I  am!  to  take such precaution against the land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come for safety, so much more perilous.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shepherd and the Sea</p>
<p>A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep  near the shore, saw the Sea very  calm and smooth, and longed to  make a voyage with a  view to commerce.  He sold  all his flock, invested  it in a  cargo of dates,  and set sail.   But a very  great tempest came  on, and  the ship  being in  danger of  sinking, he  threw all his merchandise overboard, and barely escaped with  his life in the empty ship.  Not long afterwards when someone  passed by and observed  the unruffled calm of  the Sea, he interrupted him and said, &quot;It  is again in want of dates, and  therefore looks quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion</p>
<p>AN ASS  and a  Cock were  in a  straw-yard together  when a Lion, desperate from hunger, approached the spot.  He was about to spring upon the Ass, when the Cock (to the  sound of  whose voice  the Lion,  it is  said, has a singular aversion) crowed loudly, and the Lion fled away  as fast as he could.  The Ass,  observing his trepidation at the  mere crowing of a  Cock summoned courage to  attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose.  He had run no long distance, when  the Lion, turning about, seized him and tore him to pieces.</p>
<p>False confidence often leads into danger.</p>
<p>The Mice and the Weasels</p>
<p>THE WEASELS and the  Mice waged a perpetual  war with each other,  in which much blood was shed.  The Weasels were always the victors.  The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from  the general army to command them, and that they were exposed to dangers from lack of discipline.  They therefore  chose as leaders  Mice that were  most renowned for their family descent,  strength, and counsel,  as well as  those most noted  for their courage in  the fight, so  that they might  be better marshaled  in battle array and  formed into  troops, regiments,  and battalions.   When all  this was done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war  by challenging  the  Weasels, the  newly  chosen generals  bound  their heads  with straws, that they might be more  conspicuous to all their troops.  Scarcely  had the battle begun, when a great  rout overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered  off as fast as they could to  their holes.  The generals, not  being able to get in  on account of  the ornaments  on their  heads, were  all captured  and eaten by the Weasels.</p>
<p>The more honor the more danger.</p>
<p>The Mice in Council</p>
<p>THE  MICE summoned  a council  to decide  how they  might best  devise means  of warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy the Cat.  Among the many plans suggested, the one that found most favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the  neck of  the Cat,  so that  the Mice,  being warned  by the  sound of  the tinkling, might run  away and hide  themselves in their  holes at his  approach. But when the  Mice further debated  who among them  should thus &quot;bell  the Cat,&quot; there was no one found to do it.</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Housedog</p>
<p>A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar about his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet compelled him to drag that heavy log about wherever he went. &quot;The master,&quot; he replied.  Then said the Wolf:  &quot;May  no friend of mine ever be in such a plight; for the weight of this chain is  enough to spoil the appetite.&quot;</p>
<p>The Rivers and the Sea</p>
<p>THE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying, &quot;Why is it that  when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet, you work in us such a change,  and make us salty  and unfit to  drink?&quot; The Sea,  perceiving that they  intended to throw the blame on him, said, &quot;Pray cease to flow into me, and then you will not be made briny.&quot;</p>
<p>The Playful Ass</p>
<p>AN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking about there, broke  in the tiling.  The owner went up after him and quickly drove him down, beating him severely with a thick  wooden cudgel.  The Ass  said, &quot;Why, I saw  the Monkey do this very thing yesterday, and you  all laughed heartily, as if it  afforded you very great amusement.&quot;</p>
<p>The Three Tradesmen</p>
<p>A GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called together to  consider the  best  means  of  protecting it  from  the  enemy.   A Bricklayer  earnestly recommended bricks as affording the  best material for an effective  resistance. A Carpenter, with  equal enthusiasm, proposed  timber as a  preferable method of defense.  Upon  which a  Currier stood  up and  said, &quot;Sirs,  I differ  from you altogether:  there is no material for  resistance equal to a covering of  hides; and nothing so good as leather.&quot;</p>
<p>Every man for himself.</p>
<p>The Master and His Dogs</p>
<p>A CERTAIN MAN, detained by a storm in his country house, first of all killed his sheep, and  then his  goats, for  the maintenance  of his  household.  The storm still continuing, he was obliged to slaughter his yoke oxen for food.  On seeing this, his Dogs took counsel  together, and said, &quot;It is  time for us to be  off, for if the master spare not his oxen,  who work for his gain, how can we  expect him to spare us?&#x27;</p>
<p>He is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family.</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Shepherds</p>
<p>A WOLF, passing by, saw  some Shepherds in a hut  eating a haunch of mutton  for their dinner.  Approaching them,  he said, &quot;What a  clamor you would raise  if I were to do as you are doing!&quot;</p>
<p>The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat</p>
<p>THE DOLPHINS and Whales waged a fierce war with each other.  When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head  out of the waves and said that he  would reconcile their differences if they would  accept him as an umpire.  One  of the Dolphins replied,  &quot;We would  far rather  be destroyed  in our  battle with each other than admit any interference from you in our affairs.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ass Carrying the Image</p>
<p>AN ASS once carried through the streets  of a city a famous wooden Image,  to be placed  in  one of  its  Temples.  As  he  passed along,  the  crowd made  lowly prostration before the Image.  The Ass, thinking that they bowed their heads  in token of respect  for himself, bristled  up with pride,  gave himself airs,  and refused to move another step.  The  driver, seeing him thus stop, laid  his whip lustily about his shoulders and said,  &quot;O you perverse dull-head! it is  not yet come to this, that men pay worship to an Ass.&quot;</p>
<p>They are not wise who give to themselves the credit due to others.</p>
<p>The Two Travelers and the Axe</p>
<p>TWO MEN were journeying  together.  One of them  picked up an axe  that lay upon the path, and said, &quot;I have found an axe.&quot;  &quot;Nay, my friend,&quot; replied the other, &quot;do not say &#x27;I,&#x27; but &#x27;We&#x27; have found an axe.&quot;  They had not gone far before they saw the owner of the axe pursuing them,  and he who had picked up the axe  said, &quot;We are undone.&quot;  &quot;Nay,&quot; replied the other, &quot;keep to your first mode of  speech, my friend; what you thought right then,  think right now. Say &#x27;I,&#x27; not &#x27;We&#x27;  are undone.&quot;</p>
<p>He who shares the danger ought to share the prize.</p>
<p>The Old Lion</p>
<p>A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on the ground at the point of death.  A Boar rushed upon him, and avenged with a stroke of his  tusks a long-remembered injury. Shortly afterwards  the Bull with his horns  gored him as if he were an enemy.  When the Ass saw that the huge beast could be  assailed with impunity, he let drive at  his forehead with his heels.  The  expiring Lion said, &quot;I have reluctantly brooked the insults of the brave, but to be  compelled to endure such  treatment from thee,  a disgrace to  Nature, is indeed  to die a double death.&quot;</p>
<p>The Old Hound</p>
<p>A HOUND, who  in the days  of his youth  and strength had  never yielded to  any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a boar in the chase.  He  seized him boldly by the ear, but could not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that the boar escaped.   His master, quickly coming up, was  very much disappointed, and fiercely abused  the dog.  The Hound  looked up and said,  &quot;It was not my fault.  master:  my spirit was as good as ever, but I could not  help my infirmities.  I rather deserve to be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I am.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bee and Jupiter</p>
<p>A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to Olympus to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs. Jupiter, delighted with the offering of honey, promised to  give whatever she  should ask.  She  therefore besought him, saying, &quot;Give me,  I pray thee,  a sting, that  if any mortal  shall approach to take my honey, I may kill him.&quot;   Jupiter was much displeased, for he loved  the race of man, but could not refuse  the request because of his promise.  He  thus answered the Bee:  &quot;You shall have your request, but it will be at the peril  of your own life. For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the wound you make, and then you will die from the loss of it.&quot;</p>
<p>Evil wishes, like chickens, come home to roost.</p>
<p>The Milk-Woman and Her Pail</p>
<p>A  FARMER&#x27;S  daughter was  carrying  her Pail  of  milk from  the  field to  the farmhouse, when she fell a-musing.  &quot;The money for which this milk will be sold, will buy at least three hundred  eggs. The eggs, allowing for all  mishaps, will produce two hundred and fifty chickens.  The chickens will become ready for  the market when poultry will fetch the highest price, so that by the end of the year I shall have money enough from my share to buy a new gown.  In this dress I will go to the Christmas parties, where all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss my head and refuse  them every one.&quot;  At this moment she  tossed her head in unison with  her thoughts, when down  fell the milk pail  to the ground, and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment.</p>
<p>The Seaside Travelers</p>
<p>SOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore,  climbed to the summit of a  tall cliff, and looking  over the sea,  saw in the  distance what they  thought was a large ship.  They waited in the hope  of seeing it enter the harbor, but  as the object on which they looked was driven  nearer to shore by the wind, they  found that it could  at the most  be a small  boat, and not  a ship.  When  however it reached the beach, they  discovered that it was  only a large faggot  of sticks, and one  of them  said to  his companions,  &quot;We have  waited for no purpose, for after all there is nothing to see but a load of wood.&quot;</p>
<p>Our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities.</p>
<p>The Brazier and His Dog</p>
<p>A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with his master, and  his constant companion.  While  he hammered away  at his metals  the Dog slept;  but when, on the other hand, he went to dinner and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as  if he would ask  for a share of  his meal.  His master  one day, pretending to be  angry and shaking his  stick at him, said,  &quot;You wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to you? While I am hammering on the anvil,  you sleep on the mat;  and when I begin  to eat after my  toil, you wake up  and wag your tail for food.  Do you not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that none but those who work are entitled to eat?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Ass and His Shadow</p>
<p>A  TRAVELER hired  an Ass  to convey  him to  a distant  place.  The  day being intensely hot,  and the  sun shining  in its  strength, the  Traveler stopped to rest, and sought  shelter from the  heat under the  Shadow of the  Ass.  As this afforded only protection for one, and as  the Traveler and the owner of the  Ass both claimed it, a  violent dispute arose between  them as to which  of them had the right to the Shadow.  The owner maintained that he had let the Ass only, and not his Shadow.  The  Traveler asserted that he  had, with the hire  of the Ass, hired his Shadow also.  The quarrel proceeded from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass galloped off.</p>
<p>In quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance.</p>
<p>The Ass and His Masters</p>
<p>AN ASS, belonging to  an herb-seller who gave  him too little food  and too much work made  a petition  to Jupiter  to be  released from  his present service and provided with another master.  Jupiter,  after warning him that he  would repent his request, caused him to be sold to a tile-maker.  Shortly afterwards, finding that  he had  heavier loads  to carry  and harder  work in  the brick-field,  he petitioned for another change of master.  Jupiter, telling him that it would  be the last time  that he could  grant his request,  ordained that he  be sold to a tanner.  The  Ass found  that he  had fallen  into worse  hands, and  noting his master&#x27;s occupation, said, groaning:  &quot;It would have been better for me to  have been either starved by the  one, or to have been  overworked by the other of  my former masters,  than to  have been  bought by  my present  owner, who will even after I am dead tan my hide, and make me useful to him.&quot;</p>
<p>The Oak and the Reeds</p>
<p>A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by  the wind and thrown across a stream.   It fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed:  &quot;I wonder how you, who are so  light and weak, are not entirely crushed  by these strong winds.&quot;  They replied,  &quot;You fight and contend with the wind, and consequently you are destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of air, and therefore remain unbroken, and escape.&quot;</p>
<p>Stoop to conquer.</p>
<p>The Fisherman and the Little Fish</p>
<p>A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a single  small Fish as the  result of his  day&#x27;s labor.  The  Fish, panting convulsively,  thus entreated for his life:  &quot;O Sir, what good can I be to you, and how little am  I worth? I am not yet come to my  full size.  Pray spare my life, and put  me back into the sea.  I shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of the  rich, and  then you  can catch  me again,  and make  a handsome  profit of  me.&quot;  The Fisherman replied, &quot;I should indeed be  a very simple fellow if, for  the chance of a greater uncertain profit, I were to forego my present certain gain.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hunter and the Woodman</p>
<p>A HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a Lion. He asked a  man felling oaks in  the forest if  he had seen  any marks of  his footsteps or knew where  his lair  was.  &quot;I  will,&quot; said  the man,  &quot;at once  show you  the Lion himself.&quot;  The  Hunter, turning  very pale  and chattering  with his  teeth from fear, replied, &quot;No, thank you.  I did not ask that; it is his track only I am in search of, not the Lion himself.&quot;</p>
<p>The hero is brave in deeds as well as words.</p>
<p>The Wild Boar and the Fox</p>
<p>A WILD BOAR stood under  a tree and rubbed his  tusks against the trunk.  A  Fox passing by asked him  why he thus sharpened  his teeth when there  was no danger threatening from either huntsman or hound.  He replied, &quot;I do it advisedly;  for it would never do to have to sharpen  my weapons just at the time I ought  to be using them.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion in a Farmyard</p>
<p>A LION entered  a farmyard.  The  Farmer, wishing to  catch him, shut  the gate. When the Lion found that he could not escape, he flew upon the sheep and  killed them, and then attacked  the oxen. The Farmer,  beginning to be alarmed  for his own safety, opened the gate and released the Lion.  On his departure the  Farmer grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen, but his wife, who had been a  spectator to  all that  took place,  said, &quot;On  my word, you are rightly served, for how could you  for a moment think of  shutting up a Lion along  with you in your farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only hear his roar at a distance?&#x27;</p>
<p>Mercury and the Sculptor</p>
<p>MERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he was held among mortals.   For this purpose he assumed  the character of a  man and visited in  this disguise a Sculptor&#x27;s studio having looked at various statues, he demanded the price of two figures of Jupiter and Juno.  When the sum at which they were valued was  named, he pointed to a figure of  himself, saying to the Sculptor, &quot;You  will certainly want much more for this, as it is  the statue of the Messenger of the Gods,  and author of all your gain.&quot;  The  Sculptor replied, &quot;Well, if you will  buy these, I&#x27;ll fling you that into the bargain.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swan and the Goose</p>
<p>A CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan.  He fed the one  for his table and kept the other for the  sake of its song.  When the time came  for killing the Goose, the cook went to get  him at night, when it was dark, and  he was not able to distinguish one bird  from the other.  By mistake he caught  the Swan instead of the  Goose.  The Swan, threatened  with death, burst forth  into song and thus  made himself known  by his voice,  and preserved his  life by his melody.</p>
<p>The Swollen Fox</p>
<p>A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds in the hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a hearty meal.  When he finished, he was so full that he was not  able to get out, and  began to groan and lament  his fate. Another Fox passing by heard his cries, and coming up, inquired the cause of his complaining.  On learning what had happened, he said to him, &quot;Ah, you will  have to remain there, my friend, until you become such as you were when you crept in, and then you will easily get out.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Woodcutter</p>
<p>A FOX, running before  the hounds, came across  a Woodcutter felling an  oak and begged him to show him a  safe hiding-place. The Woodcutter advised him  to take shelter in his own hut,  so the Fox crept in  and hid himself in a  corner.  The huntsman soon came up with his hounds  and inquired of the Woodcutter if he  had seen the Fox.  He declared  that he had not seen  him, and yet pointed, all  the time he was speaking, to the hut where the Fox lay hidden.  The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing his word, hastened forward in the chase.   As soon as they were well away, the  Fox departed without taking any notice of  the Woodcutter:   whereon  he  called  to  him  and  reproached  him,  saying,  &quot;You ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you leave me without a  word of thanks.&quot;  The Fox  replied, &quot;Indeed, I should  have thanked you fervently  if your deeds  had been  as good  as your  words, and  if your  hands had  not been traitors to your speech.&quot;</p>
<p>The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the Cock</p>
<p>A  BIRDCATCHER  was about  to  sit down  to  a dinner  of  herbs when  a  friend unexpectedly came in.  The bird-trap was quite empty, as he had caught  nothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge,  which he had tamed for a decoy.  The  bird entreated earnestly for his life:  &quot;What  would you do without me when  next you spread your nets?  Who would chirp  you to sleep,  or call for  you the covey of answering birds?&#x27;  The Birdcatcher spared his life, and determined to pick out a fine  young Cock  just attaining  to his  comb.  But  the Cock  expostulated in piteous tones from  his perch:  &quot;If  you kill me,  who will announce  to you the appearance of the dawn? Who will wake  you to your daily tasks or tell  you when it is time to visit the bird-trap in the morning?&#x27;  He replied, &quot;What you say is true.  You are a capital bird at telling  the time of day.  But my friend and  I must have our dinners.&quot;</p>
<p>Necessity knows no law.</p>
<p>The Monkey and the Fishermen</p>
<p>A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting their nets into  a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings. The Fishermen after a while  gave up fishing,  and on  going home  to dinner  left their  nets upon the bank.  The Monkey, who is  the most imitative  of animals, descended  from the treetop  and endeavored to do as they had done.  Having handled the net, he threw it into the river, but became tangled  in the meshes and  drowned.  With his last  breath he said to himself,  &quot;I am rightly  served; for what  business had I  who had never handled a net to try and catch fish?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Flea and the Wrestler</p>
<p>A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him, causing the man  to call loudly upon Hercules for help.  When the Flea a second time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said, &quot;O Hercules! if you will not help me against a  Flea, how can I hope for your assistance against greater antagonists?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Two Frogs</p>
<p>TWO FROGS dwelt  in the same  pool.  When the  pool dried up  under the summer&#x27;s heat, they left it  and set out together  for another home.  As  they went along they chanced to pass a deep well,  amply supplied with water, and when they  saw it, one of the Frogs  said to the other, &quot;Let  us descend and make our  abode in this well:  it will furnish us  with shelter and food.&quot;  The other  replied with greater caution,  &quot;But suppose  the water  should fail  us.  How  can we get out again from so great a depth?&#x27;</p>
<p>Do nothing without a regard to the consequences.</p>
<p>The Cat and the Mice</p>
<p>A CERTAIN HOUSE was  overrun with Mice.  A  Cat, discovering this, made  her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one. Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their holes.  The Cat was no longer able to get at them and  perceived that  she must  tempt them  forth by  some device.  For this purpose she jumped upon a peg,  and suspending herself from it, pretended  to be dead.  One of the Mice, peeping stealthily  out, saw her and said, &quot;Ah, my  good madam, even though you should turn into a meal-bag, we will not come near you.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox</p>
<p>A LION and a Bear seized a Kid  at the same moment, and fought fiercely for  its possession.  When they  had fearfully lacerated  each other and  were faint from the long  combat, they  lay down  exhausted with  fatigue.  A  Fox, who had gone round them at a  distance several times, saw  them both stretched on  the ground with the Kid lying untouched in the middle.  He ran in between them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he  could.  The Lion and the Bear saw him,  but not being able to get  up, said, &quot;Woe be to  us, that we should have  fought and belabored ourselves only to serve the turn of a Fox.&quot;</p>
<p>It sometimes happens that one man has all the toil, and another all the profit.</p>
<p>The Doe and the Lion</p>
<p>A DOE hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging to a Lion.   The Lion concealed himself on seeing her approach, but when she was safe within  the cave, sprang upon her and tore her  to pieces.  &quot;Woe is me,&quot; exclaimed the  Doe, &quot;who have  escaped from  man, only  to throw  myself into  the mouth  of a  wild beast?&#x27;</p>
<p>In avoiding one evil, care must be taken not to fall into another.</p>
<p>The Farmer and the Fox</p>
<p>A FARMER, who bore a grudge against  a Fox for robbing his poultry yard,  caught him at last, and being determined to take an ample revenge, tied some rope  well soaked in oil to his  tail, and set it on  fire.  The Fox by a  strange fatality rushed to the fields of the Farmer who had captured him.  It was the time of the wheat  harvest;  but the  Farmer  reaped nothing  that  year and  returned  home grieving sorely.</p>
<p>The Seagull and the Kite</p>
<p>A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep gullet-bag and lay down on the shore  to die.  A Kite  saw him and exclaimed:   &quot;You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the air has no business to seek its food from the sea.&quot;</p>
<p>Every man should be content to mind his own business.</p>
<p>The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury</p>
<p>A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore  the shipwreck of a vessel, of  which the crew and  passengers were  all drowned.   He inveighed  against the injustice of Providence, which would for  the sake of one  criminal perchance sailing in  the ship allow so  many innocent persons  to perish.  As  he was indulging  in these reflections, he found  himself surrounded by  a whole army  of Ants, near  whose nest he was standing.  One of them climbed up and stung him, and he  immediately trampled  them all  to death  with his  foot.  Mercury  presented himself,  and striking  the Philosopher  with his  wand, said,  &quot;And are  you indeed  to make yourself a judge of  the dealings of Providence,  who hast thyself in  a similar manner treated these poor Ants?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Mouse and the Bull</p>
<p>A BULL was bitten by  a Mouse and, angered by  the wound, tried to capture  him. But the Mouse reached  his hole in safety.   Though the Bull dug  into the walls with his horns, he tired before he could rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep outside  the hole.  The Mouse  peeped out, crept furtively  up his flank, and again biting him, retreated to his hole.  The Bull rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed.  At which the Mouse said, &quot;The great do not always prevail.  There are times when the small and lowly are the  strongest to do mischief.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion and the Hare</p>
<p>A LION  came across  a Hare,  who was  fast asleep.   He was  just in the act of seizing her, when a fine young Hart  trotted by, and he left the Hare  to follow him.  The  Hare, scared  by the  noise, awoke  and scudded  away.  The  Lion was unable after a long chase to catch the Hart, and returned to feed upon the Hare. On finding that the Hare  also had run off, he  said, &quot;I am rightly served,  for having let go  of the food  that I had  in my hand  for the chance  of obtaining more.&quot;</p>
<p>The Peasant and the Eagle</p>
<p>A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring the bird, set him free.  The  Eagle did  not prove  ungrateful to  his deliverer,  for seeing  the Peasant sitting under a wall which was not safe, he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a bundle from his  head.  When the Peasant rose in  pursuit, the Eagle let the  bundle fall again.   Taking it up,  the man returned  to the same place, to  find that  the wall  under which  he had  been sitting  had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service rendered him by the Eagle.</p>
<p>The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter</p>
<p>A VERY POOR  MAN, a Carpenter  by trade, had  a wooden image  of Mercury, before which he made offerings day by day, and begged the idol to make him rich, but in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer.  At last, being very angry, he took his image  down from its pedestal  and dashed it against  the wall. When its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which the Carpenter quickly picked  up  and said,  &quot;Well,  I think  thou  art altogether  contradictory  and unreasonable; for when I paid you honor,  I reaped no benefits:  but now that  I maltreat you I am loaded with an abundance of riches.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bull and the Goat</p>
<p>A BULL, escaping from  a Lion, hid in  a cave which some  shepherds had recently occupied.  As soon as  he entered, a He-Goat  left in the cave  sharply attacked him with his horns.  The Bull quietly addressed him:  &quot;Butt away as much as  you will.  I have no fear of you, but  of the Lion.  Let that monster go away  and I will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a Goat and a Bull.&quot;</p>
<p>It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in distress.</p>
<p>The Dancing Monkeys</p>
<p>A PRINCE had  some Monkeys trained  to dance.  Being  naturally great mimics  of men&#x27;s actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils, and when arrayed in their rich  clothes and  masks, they  danced as  well as  any of  the courtiers.   The spectacle  was  often repeated  with  great applause,  till  on one  occasion  a courtier, bent on  mischief, took from  his pocket a  handful of nuts  and threw them upon the stage.  The Monkeys at the sight of the nuts forgot their  dancing and became (as indeed they were)  Monkeys instead of actors.  Pulling off  their masks and tearing their robes, they  fought with one another for the  nuts.  The dancing spectacle thus came  to an end amidst  the laughter and ridicule  of the audience.</p>
<p>The Fox and the Leopard</p>
<p>THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which  was the more beautiful of the two.   The Leopard exhibited one by  one the various spots  which decorated his skin.   But the Fox, interrupting him, said, &quot;And how much more beautiful than you am I, who am decorated, not in body, but in mind.&quot;</p>
<p>The Monkeys and Their Mother</p>
<p>THE MONKEY, it is  said, has two young  ones at each birth.   The Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care, but hates and neglects the other.  It happened once that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection  of the Mother, while the despised  one was nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was exposed.</p>
<p>The best intentions will not always ensure success.</p>
<p>The Oaks and Jupiter</p>
<p>THE OAKS presented a complaint to  Jupiter, saying, &quot;We bear for no  purpose the burden of life,  as of all  the trees that  grow we are  the most continually in peril of the axe.&quot;  Jupiter made answer:  &quot;You have only to thank yourselves for the  misfortunes  to which  you  are exposed:   for  if you  did  not make  such excellent  pillars  and  posts,  and  prove  yourselves  so  serviceable  to the carpenters and  the farmers,  the axe  would not  so frequently  be laid to your roots.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hare and the Hound</p>
<p>A HOUND started a Hare from his lair,  but after a long run, gave up the  chase. A goat-herd  seeing him  stop, mocked  him, saying  &quot;The little  one is the best runner of the two.&quot;  The Hound  replied, &quot;You do not see the  difference between us:  I was only running for a dinner, but he for his life.&quot;</p>
<p>The Traveler and Fortune</p>
<p>A TRAVELER wearied from a long  journey lay down, overcome with fatigue,  on the very brink of a deep  well.  Just as he was  about to fall into the  water, Dame Fortune,  it is  said, appeared  to him  and waking  him from  his slumber  thus addressed him:  &quot;Good  Sir, pray wake  up:  for if  you fall into  the well, the blame will be thrown  on me, and I  shall get an ill  name among mortals; for  I find that men are sure to impute  their calamities to me, however much by  their own folly they have really brought them on themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone is more or less master of his own fate.</p>
<p>The Bald Knight</p>
<p>A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt.  A sudden puff of wind blew off his hat  and wig,  at which  a loud  laugh rang  forth from  his companions.  He pulled up his horse, and with great  glee joined in the joke by saying,  &quot;What a marvel it is that hairs  which are not mine should  fly from me, when they  have forsaken even the man on whose head they grew.&quot;</p>
<p>The Shepherd and the Dog</p>
<p>A SHEPHERD penning his sheep  in the fold for the  night was about to shut  up a wolf with  them, when  his Dog  perceiving the  wolf said,  &quot;Master, how can you expect the sheep to be safe if you admit a wolf into the fold?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Lamp</p>
<p>A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted that it gave more light  than the  sun.  Then  a sudden  puff of  wind arose,  and the  Lamp was immediately extinguished.  Its  owner lit it  again, and said:   &quot;Boast no more, but henceforth be content to give thy light in silence.  Know that not even  the stars need to be relit&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass</p>
<p>THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to assist each other  in the chase.   Having secured  a large  booty, the  Lion on  their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his  due portion to each of the three  partners in the treaty.  The  Ass carefully divided  the spoil into  three equal shares  and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice.  The Lion,  bursting out into a great rage,  devoured the Ass.  Then he  requested the Fox to do  him the favor to make a division.  The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel.  The Lion said, &quot;Who has  taught you,  my very  excellent fellow,  the art  of division? You are perfect to a fraction.&quot;  He replied,  &quot;I learned it from the Ass,  by witnessing his fate.&quot;</p>
<p>Happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others.</p>
<p>The Bull, the Lioness, and the Wild-Boar Hunter</p>
<p>A BULL  finding a  lion&#x27;s cub  asleep gored  him to  death with  his horns.  The Lioness came  up, and  bitterly lamented  the death  of her  whelp.  A wild-boar Hunter, seeing her  distress, stood at  a distance and  said to her,  &quot;Think how many men there are who have reason  to lament the loss of their children,  whose deaths have been caused by you.&quot;</p>
<p>The Oak and the Woodcutters</p>
<p>THE WOODCUTTER cut down a Mountain Oak and split it in pieces, making wedges  of its own branches for dividing  the trunk.  The Oak said  with a sigh, &quot;I do  not care about the blows of the axe aimed at my roots, but I do grieve at being torn in pieces by these wedges made from my own branches.&quot;</p>
<p>Misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear.</p>
<p>The Hen and the Golden Eggs</p>
<p>A COTTAGER  and his  wife had  a Hen  that laid  a golden  egg every  day.  They supposed that the Hen must  contain a great lump of  gold in its inside, and  in order to  get the  gold they  killed it.  Having done  so, they  found to  their surprise that the Hen differed in no respect from their other hens.  The foolish pair, thus hoping to become rich all at once, deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by day.</p>
<p>The Ass and the Frogs</p>
<p>AN ASS,  carrying a  load of  wood, passed  through a  pond.  As he was crossing through the water he lost his footing, stumbled and fell, and not being able  to rise on account of his load,  groaned heavily.  Some Frogs frequenting the  pool heard his  lamentation, and  said, &quot;What  would you  do if  you had to live here always as we do, when you make such a fuss about a mere fall into the water?&quot;</p>
<p>Men  often  bear  little  grievances  with  less  courage  than  they  do  large misfortunes.</p>
<p>The Crow and the Raven</p>
<p>A CROW was jealous of the Raven,  because he was considered a bird of  good omen and always attracted the attention of men,  who noted by his flight the good  or evil course of future events.  Seeing some travelers approaching, the Crow  flew up into a tree, and perching herself on one of the branches, cawed as loudly  as she  could.   The  travelers  turned towards  the  sound  and  wondered what  it foreboded,  when one  of them  said to  his companion,  &quot;Let us  proceed on  our journey, my friend, for it is only the caw of a crow, and her cry, you know,  is no omen.&quot;</p>
<p>Those who assume a character which does not belong to them, only make themselves ridiculous.</p>
<p>The Trees and the Axe</p>
<p>A MAN came into  a forest and asked  the Trees to provide  him a handle for  his axe.  The  Trees consented  to his  request and  gave him  a young ash-tree.  No sooner had the man fitted a new handle to his axe from it, than he began to  use it and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest.  An old oak,  lamenting when  too late  the destruction  of his  companions, said  to a neighboring cedar, &quot;The first step has lost us all.  If we had not given up  the rights of the ash, we might yet have retained our own privileges and have  stood for ages.&quot;</p>
<p>The Crab and the Fox</p>
<p>A CRAB, forsaking the seashore, chose a neighboring green meadow as its  feeding ground.  A Fox came across  him, and being very hungry  ate him up.  Just as  he was on the  point of being  eaten, the Crab  said, &quot;I well  deserve my fate, for what business had I on the land, when by my nature and habits I am only  adapted for the sea?&#x27;</p>
<p>Contentment with our lot is an element of happiness.</p>
<p>The Woman and Her Hen</p>
<p>A WOMAN possessed a Hen that gave her an egg every day.  She often pondered  how she  might obtain  two eggs  daily instead  of one,  and at  last, to  gain her purpose, determined to give the Hen a double allowance of barley.  From that day the Hen became fat and sleek, and never once laid another egg.</p>
<p>The Ass and the Old Shepherd</p>
<p>A SHEPHERD, watching his Ass feeding in a meadow, was alarmed all of a sudden by the cries  of the  enemy.  He  appealed to  the Ass  to fly  with him, lest they should both be captured, but the animal lazily replied, &quot;Why should I, pray?  Do you think it likely the conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers?&#x27;  &quot;No,&quot; rejoined the Shepherd.  &quot;Then,&quot; said the Ass, &quot;as long as I carry the  panniers, what matters it to me whom I serve?&#x27;</p>
<p>In a  change of  government the  poor change  nothing beyond  the name  of their master.</p>
<p>The Kites and the Swans</p>
<p>TEE KITES of olden times, as well as the Swans, had the privilege of song.   But having heard the neigh of the horse, they were so enchanted with the sound, that they tried to imitate it; and, in trying to neigh, they forgot how to sing.</p>
<p>The desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of present blessings.</p>
<p>The Wolves and the Sheepdogs</p>
<p>THE WOLVES thus addressed the Sheepdogs:  &quot;Why should you, who are like us in so many things, not be entirely of one  mind with us, and live with us  as brothers should? We differ from you in one  point only.  We live in freedom, but  you bow down to and slave for men, who  in return for your services flog you  with whips and put collars on your necks.  They make you also guard their sheep, and  while they eat the mutton throw  only the bones to you.   If you will be persuaded  by us, you will give us  the sheep, and we will  enjoy them in common, till  we all are surfeited.&quot;  The Dogs listened  favorably to these proposals, and,  entering the den of the Wolves, they were set upon and torn to pieces.</p>
<p>The Hares and the Foxes</p>
<p>THE HARES waged  war with the  Eagles, and called  upon the Foxes  to help them. They replied, &quot;We would willingly have helped  you, if we had not known who  you were, and with whom you were fighting.&quot;</p>
<p>Count the cost before you commit yourselves.</p>
<p>The Bowman and Lion</p>
<p>A VERY  SKILLFUL BOWMAN  went to  the mountains  in search  of game, but all the beasts of the  forest fled at  his approach.  The  Lion alone challenged  him to combat.  The Bowman immediately shot out an arrow and said to the Lion:  &quot;I send thee my messenger, that from him thou mayest learn what I myself shall be when I assail thee.&quot;  The wounded  Lion rushed away in  great fear, and when  a Fox who had seen it all happen told him to be of good courage and not to back off at the first attack he replied:  &quot;You counsel me in vain; for if he sends so fearful  a messenger, how shall I abide the attack of the man himself?&#x27;</p>
<p>Be on guard against men who can strike from a distance.</p>
<p>The Camel</p>
<p>WHEN MAN first saw the Camel, he was so frightened at his vast size that he  ran away.   After a  time, perceiving  the meekness  and gentleness  of the  beast&#x27;s temper, he summoned courage enough to approach him.  Soon afterwards,  observing that he was an animal altogether  deficient in spirit, he assumed such  boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth, and to let a child drive him.</p>
<p>Use serves to overcome dread.</p>
<p>The Wasp and the Snake</p>
<p>A WASP seated  himself upon the  head of a  Snake and, striking  him unceasingly with his stings, wounded  him to death.  The  Snake, being in great  torment and not knowing  how to  rid himself  of his  enemy, saw  a wagon heavily laden with wood, and went and purposely placed his head under the wheels, saying, &quot;At least my enemy and I shall perish together.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dog and the Hare</p>
<p>A HOUND having started a Hare on the hillside pursued her for some distance,  at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her life, and at  another fawning upon her, as if in play with another dog.  The Hare said to him, &quot;I wish you would act sincerely  by me, and show  yourself in your true  colors.  If you are a friend, why do you bite me so hard? If an enemy, why do you fawn on me?&#x27;</p>
<p>No one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust or distrust him.</p>
<p>The Bull and the Calf</p>
<p>A BULL  was striving  with all  his might  to squeeze  himself through  a narrow passage which led to his stall.  A young Calf came up, and offered to go  before and show  him the  way by  which he  could manage  to pass.   &quot;Save yourself the trouble,&quot; said the Bull; &quot;I knew that way long before you were born.&quot;</p>
<p>The Stag, the Wolf, and the Sheep</p>
<p>A STAG asked  a Sheep to  lend him a  measure of wheat,  and said that  the Wolf would  be his  surety.  The  Sheep, fearing  some fraud  was intended,  excused herself, saying, &quot;The Wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants and to run  off; and you, too, can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight.  How then shall I be able to find you, when the day of payment comes?&#x27;</p>
<p>Two blacks do not make one white.</p>
<p>The Peacock and the Crane</p>
<p>A PEACOCK spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a Crane that passed by,  ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying,  &quot;I am robed, like a king, in gold  and purple and all the colors of the rainbow;  while you have not a bit of color  on your wings.&quot; &quot;True,&quot; replied the Crane; &quot;but I soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my  voice to the  stars, while you  walk below, like  a cock, among  the birds of the dunghill.&quot;</p>
<p>Fine feathers don&#x27;t make fine birds.</p>
<p>The Fox and the Hedgehog</p>
<p>A FOX swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the current into a very deep ravine, where  he lay for a long  time very much bruised, sick,  and unable to  move.  A  swarm of  hungry blood-sucking  flies settled  upon him.  A Hedgehog, passing by, saw his anguish  and inquired if he should drive  away the flies that were tormenting  him.  &quot;By no means,&quot;  replied the Fox; &quot;pray  do not molest them.&quot;  &quot;How is this?&#x27;  said the Hedgehog; &quot;do you not want to be rid  of them?&#x27;  &quot;No,&quot;  returned the  Fox, &quot;for  these flies  which you  see are  full of blood, and sting  me but little,  and if you  rid me of  these which are already satiated, others more hungry will come in their place, and will drink up all the blood I have left.&quot;</p>
<p>The Eagle, the Cat, and the Wild Sow</p>
<p>AN  EAGLE made  her nest  at the  top of  a lofty  oak; a  Cat, having  found a convenient hole, moved into  the middle of the  trunk; and a Wild  Sow, with her young, took  shelter in  a hollow  at its  foot. The  Cat cunningly  resolved to destroy this chance-made  colony. To carry  out her design,  she climbed to  the nest of the Eagle, and said, &quot;Destruction is preparing for you, and for me  too, unfortunately.  The Wild Sow, whom you see daily digging up the earth, wishes to uproot the  oak, so  she may  on its  fall seize  our families  as food  for her young.&quot;  Having thus frightened the Eagle  out of her senses, she crept  down to the cave of the Sow, and said,  &quot;Your children are in great danger; for  as soon as you go  out with your  litter to find  food, the Eagle  is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs.&quot;   Having instilled these fears into the  Sow, she went and pretended to hide herself in  the hollow of the tree.  When night  came she went forth with silent foot  and obtained food for herself and  her kittens, but feigning to be afraid, she  kept a lookout all through the  day.  Meanwhile, the Eagle, full  of fear of  the Sow, sat  still on the  branches, and the  Sow, terrified by the  Eagle, did not  dare to go  out from her  cave.  And thus they both,  along  with their  families,  perished from  hunger,  and afforded  ample provision for the Cat and her kittens.</p>
<p>The Thief and the Innkeeper</p>
<p>A THIEF hired  a room in  a tavern and  stayed a while  in the hope  of stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning.  When he had waited some days in  vain, he  saw the  Innkeeper dressed  in a  new and  handsome coat  and sitting before his door.  The Thief sat down beside him and talked with him.  As the conversation began to flag, the  Thief yawned terribly and at the  same time howled like a  wolf.  The Innkeeper  said, &quot;Why do  you howl so  fearfully?&#x27;  &quot;I will tell you,&quot; said the Thief, &quot;but first let me ask you to hold my clothes, or I shall tear them to pieces.  I know not, sir, when I got this habit of yawning, nor whether these attacks of howling were  inflicted on me as a judgment for  my crimes, or for any  other cause; but this  I do know, that  when I yawn for  the third time, I actually  turn into a wolf  and attack men.&quot;  With  this speech he commenced a second  fit of yawning  and again howled  like a wolf,  as he had at first.  The  Innkeeper.  hearing  his tale  and believing  what he  said, became greatly alarmed and, rising from his seat, attempted to run away. The Thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop, saying, &quot;Pray wait, sir, and hold my clothes, or I shall tear  them to pieces in my  fury, when I turn into  a wolf.&quot; At the same  moment he yawned  the third time  and set up  a terrible howl.  The Innkeeper, frightened  lest he  should be  attacked, left  his new  coat in  the Thief&#x27;s hand and  ran as fast  as he could  into the inn  for safety.  The Thief made off with the coat and did not return again to the inn.</p>
<p>Every tale is not to be believed.</p>
<p>The Mule</p>
<p>A MULE, frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn, galloped about in a very extravagant manner,  and said  to himself:  &quot;My father  surely was  a high mettled racer, and I am  his own child in speed  and spirit.&quot;  On the next  day, being  driven  a long  journey,  and feeling  very  wearied, he  exclaimed  in a disconsolate tone:  &quot;I  must have made  a mistake; my  father, after all,  could have been only an ass.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hart and the Vine</p>
<p>A HART, hard  pressed in the  chase, hid himself  beneath the large  leaves of a Vine.  The  huntsmen, in  their haste,  overshot the  place of  his concealment. Supposing all danger to  have passed, the Hart  began to nibble the  tendrils of the Vine.  One of the huntsmen, attracted by the rustling of the leaves,  looked back, and seeing the Hart, shot an  arrow from his bow and struck it.  The Hart, at the point  of death, groaned:   &quot;I am rightly  served, for I  should not have maltreated the Vine that saved me.&quot;</p>
<p>The Serpent and the Eagle</p>
<p>A SERPENT and an Eagle were struggling with each other in deadly conflict.   The Serpent had the advantage, and was about to strangle the bird.  A countryman saw them, and running up, loosed the coil of the Serpent and let the Eagle go  free. The Serpent, irritated at the escape  of his prey, injected his poison  into the drinking horn of the countryman.  The rustic, ignorant of his danger, was  about to  drink, when  the Eagle  struck his  hand with  his wing,  and, seizing  the drinking horn in his talons, carried it aloft.</p>
<p>The Crow and the Pitcher</p>
<p>A CROW perishing with thirst saw a pitcher, and hoping to find water, flew to it with delight.  When he reached it, he discovered to his grief that it  contained so little water that  he could not possibly  get at it.  He  tried everything he could think of to reach the water, but all his efforts were in vain.  At last he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with  his beak into  the pitcher,  until he  brought the  water within  his reach and thus saved his life.</p>
<p>Necessity is the mother of invention.</p>
<p>The Two Frogs</p>
<p>TWO FROGS were neighbors.   One inhabited a deep  pond, far removed from  public view; the other  lived in a  gully containing little  water, and traversed  by a country road.  The Frog that lived in  the pond warned his friend to change  his residence and  entreated him  to come  and live  with him,  saying that he would enjoy greater  safety from  danger and  more abundant  food.  The other refused, saying that he  felt it so  very hard to  leave a place  to which he  had become accustomed.  A few days  afterwards a heavy wagon  passed through the gully  and crushed him to death under its wheels.</p>
<p>A willful man will have his way to his own hurt.</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Fox</p>
<p>AT ONE TIME a very large and strong Wolf was born among the wolves, who exceeded all his fellow-wolves in strength, size, and swiftness, so that they unanimously decided to call him &quot;Lion.&quot; The Wolf,  with a lack of sense proportioned to  his enormous size, thought that they gave him this name in earnest, and, leaving his own race, consorted exclusively  with the lions.  An  old sly Fox, seeing  this, said, &quot;May I never make myself  so ridiculous as you do  in your pride and self conceit; for even though you have the size of a lion among wolves, in a herd  of lions you are definitely a wolf.&quot;</p>
<p>The Walnut-Tree</p>
<p>A WALNUT TREE standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop of fruit.  For  the sake of the nuts, the passers-by broke its branches with stones and sticks.  The Walnut-Tree piteously exclaimed, &quot;O wretched me! that those whom I cheer with my fruit should repay me with these painful requitals!&quot;</p>
<p>The Gnat and the Lion</p>
<p>A GNAT came and  said to a Lion,  &quot;I do not in  the least fear you,  nor are you stronger than I  am.  For in  what does your  strength consist? You  can scratch with your claws and bite with your  teeth an a woman in her quarrels.   I repeat that I am altogether more powerful than  you; and if you doubt it, let  us fight and see who will conquer.&quot;  The Gnat, having sounded his horn, fastened  himself upon the Lion and stung him on the nostrils and the parts of the face devoid  of hair.  While trying to crush him, the Lion tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself severely. The Gnat  thus prevailed over the Lion,  and, buzzing about  in  a song  of  triumph, flew  away.   But shortly  afterwards  he became entangled in  the meshes  of a  cobweb and  was eaten  by a  spider. He  greatly lamented his fate,  saying, &quot;Woe is  me! that I,  who can wage  war successfully with  the  hugest  beasts,  should perish  myself  from  this  spider, the  most inconsiderable of insects!&quot;</p>
<p>The Monkey and the Dolphin</p>
<p>A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took  with him a Monkey to amuse him while  on shipboard.  As he  sailed off the  coast of Greece,  a violent tempest  arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his Monkey, and all the crew were obliged  to swim for their lives.  A Dolphin  saw the Monkey contending with the  waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is always said to befriend), came and  placed himself under him, to convey him on  his back in safety to the shore.   When the Dolphin arrived with his burden in sight  of land not far from Athens, he  asked the Monkey if he were an Athenian.  The latter replied that he was, and that  he was descended from  one of the  most noble families  in that city.   The Dolphin then inquired if he knew the  Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens).   Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend. The  Dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods,  dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him.</p>
<p>The Jackdaw and the Doves</p>
<p>A JACKDAW, seeing some  Doves in a cote  abundantly provided with food,  painted himself white  and joined  them in  order to  share their plentiful maintenance. The Doves, as long as  he was silent, supposed him  to be one of themselves  and admitted him to  their cote.  But  when one day  he forgot himself  and began to chatter, they  discovered his  true character  and drove  him forth, pecking him with their beaks.  Failing  to obtain food among  the Doves, he returned  to the Jackdaws.  They too, not recognizing him on account of his color.  expelled  him from living with them. So desiring two ends, he obtained neither.</p>
<p>The Horse and the Stag</p>
<p>AT ONE TIME the Horse had the  plain entirely to himself.  Then a Stag  intruded into his domain and shared his pasture.  The Horse, desiring to revenge  himself on the stranger,  asked a man  if he were  willing to help  him in punishing the Stag.  The man replied that  if the Horse would receive  a bit in his mouth  and agree to carry him,  he would contrive effective  weapons against the Stag.  The Horse consented and allowed the man to mount him.  From that hour he found  that instead of obtaining revenge on the Stag, he had enslaved himself to the service of man.</p>
<p>The Kid and the Wolf</p>
<p>A KID, returning  without protection from  the pasture, was  pursued by a  Wolf. Seeing he could not  escape, he turned round,  and said:  &quot;I know,  friend Wolf, that I must be your prey, but before I die I would ask of you one favor you will play me  a tune  to which  I may  dance.&quot;  The  Wolf complied,  and while he was piping and the Kid was dancing, some  hounds hearing the sound ran up and  began chasing the Wolf.  Turning to the Kid, he said, &quot;It is just what I deserve;  for I, who am only a butcher, should not have turned piper to please you.&quot;</p>
<p>The Prophet</p>
<p>A WIZARD, sitting in the marketplace, was telling the fortunes of the passers-by when a person ran up in great haste, and announced to him that the doors of  his house had been broken open and that all his goods were being stolen.  He  sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as  he could run.  A neighbor saw him  running and  said, &quot;Oh!  you fellow  there! you  say you  can foretell  the fortunes  of others; how is it you did not foresee your own?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Monkey</p>
<p>A FOX and a Monkey were traveling together on the same road.  As they journeyed, they passed through a cemetery full of monuments. &quot;All these monuments which you see,&quot; said  the Monkey,  &quot;are in  honor of  my ancestors,  who were in their day freedmen and citizens  of great renown.&quot;   The Fox replied,  &quot;You have chosen  a most  appropriate  subject  for your  falsehoods,  as  I am  sure  none  of your ancestors will be able to contradict you.&quot;</p>
<p>A false tale often betrays itself.</p>
<p>The Thief and the Housedog</p>
<p>A THIEF came in the  night to break into a  house.  He brought with him  several slices of meat in order to pacify  the Housedog, so that he would not  alarm his master by barking.  As the Thief threw him the pieces of meat, the Dog said, &quot;If you think to stop my mouth, you will be greatly mistaken.  This sudden  kindness at your  hands will  only make  me more  watchful, lest  under these  unexpected favors to myself, you have some private ends to accomplish for your own benefit, and for my master&#x27;s injury.&quot;</p>
<p>The Man, the Horse, the Ox, and the Dog</p>
<p>A HORSE, Ox, and  Dog, driven to great  straits by the cold,  sought shelter and protection from Man.  He received them kindly, lighted a fire, and warmed  them. He let the Horse make free with his  oats, gave the Ox an abundance of hay,  and fed  the Dog  with meat  from his  own table.   Grateful for  these favors,  the animals determined to repay him to the best of their ability.  For this purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, and each endowed one portion  of it with the qualities which chiefly characterized himself.  The Horse chose  his earliest years  and gave  them his  own attributes:   hence every  man is in his youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion.   The Ox took  under his  patronage the  next term  of life,  and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work, devoted  to labor, and resolute to amass wealth  and to husband his resources.  The end of life  was reserved for the  Dog, wherefore the old man is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish,  tolerant only  of his  own household,  but averse  to strangers  and to  all who  do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.</p>
<p>The Apes and the Two Travelers</p>
<p>TWO MEN, one who always spoke the truth and the other who told nothing but lies, were traveling  together and  by chance  came to  the land  of Apes.  One of the Apes, who had raised himself to be king, commanded them to be seized and brought before him, that he might  know what was said of  him among men.  He ordered  at the same time that all the Apes be arranged in a long row on his right hand  and on his left, and that a throne be  placed for him, as was the custom among  men. After these preparations he signified that the two men should be brought  before him, and greeted them with this salutation:   &quot;What sort of a king do I  seem to you to be,  O strangers?&#x27;  The  Lying Traveler replied,  &quot;You seem to  me a most mighty king.&quot;  &quot;And what is your estimate of those you see around me?&#x27;  &quot;These,&quot; he  made  answer,  &quot;are  worthy  companions of  yourself,  fit  at  least  to be ambassadors and leaders of armies.&quot;  The  Ape and all his court, gratified  with the lie, commanded that  a handsome present be  given to the flatterer.  On this the truthful Traveler thought to himself, &quot;If  so great a reward be given for  a lie, with what gift may  not I be rewarded, if,  according to my custom, I  tell the truth?&#x27;  The  Ape quickly turned  to him.  &quot;And  pray how do  I and these my friends around me seem to you?&#x27;  &quot;Thou art,&quot; he said, &quot;a most excellent Ape, and all these thy companions after thy example are excellent Apes too.&quot; The King  of the Apes, enraged at hearing these truths, gave him over to the teeth and  claws of his companions.</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Shepherd</p>
<p>A WOLF followed a flock of sheep for  a long time and did not attempt to  injure one of them.  The Shepherd at first  stood on his guard against him, as  against an enemy, and kept  a strict watch over  his movements.  But when  the Wolf, day after day,  kept in  the company  of the  sheep and  did not  make the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began  to look upon him as a guardian  of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it; and when occasion called  him one day into the city, he left the sheep entirely in his charge.  The Wolf,  now that he had the opportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of  the flock.   When the  Shepherd returned  to find  his flock  destroyed, he exclaimed:  &quot;I have been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Hares and the Lions</p>
<p>THE HARES  harangued the  assembly, and  argued that  all should  be equal.  The Lions made this reply:  &quot;Your words, O Hares! are good; but they lack both claws and teeth such as we have.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lark and Her Young Ones</p>
<p>A LARK had  made her nest  in the early  spring on the  young green wheat.   The brood had  almost grown  to their  full strength  and attained  the use of their wings and  the full  plumage of  their feathers,  when the  owner of  the field, looking over his  ripe crop, said,  &quot;The time has  come when I  must ask all  my neighbors to help me with my harvest.&quot;  One of the young Larks heard his  speech and related it to  his mother, inquiring of  her to what place  they should move for safety.  &quot;There is no occasion to  move yet, my son,&quot; she replied; &quot;the  man who only sends  to his friends  to help him  with his harvest  is not really  in earnest.&quot;  The owner of the field came again a few days later and saw the  wheat shedding  the grain  from excess  of ripeness.   He said,  &quot;I will  come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with as many reapers as I can hire, and will  get in the harvest.&quot;  The Lark on hearing these words said to her brood, &quot;It is time now to be off, my little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he no longer trusts his friends, but will reap the field himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Self-help is the best help.</p>
<p>The Fox and the Lion</p>
<p>WHEN A FOX who  had never yet seen  a Lion, fell in  with him by chance  for the first time in the  forest, he was so  frightened that he nearly  died with fear. On meeting him for the  second time, he was still  much alarmed, but not to  the same extent  as at  first.  On  seeing him  the third  time, he  so increased in boldness that he went up to him and commenced a familiar conversation with him.</p>
<p>Acquaintance softens prejudices.</p>
<p>The Weasel and the Mice</p>
<p>A WEASEL, inactive from  age and infirmities, was  not able to catch  mice as he once did.  He therefore rolled himself in  flour and lay down in a dark  corner. A Mouse, supposing him to be food, leaped upon him, and was instantly caught and squeezed to death.  Another perished in a similar manner, and then a third,  and still others  after them.   A very  old Mouse,  who had  escaped many a trap and snare, observed from a safe distance the trick of his crafty foe and said,  &quot;Ah! you that lie there, may you prosper just in the same proportion as you are  what you pretend to be!&quot;</p>
<p>The Boy Bathing</p>
<p>A BOY bathing in  a river was in  danger of being drowned.   He called out to  a passing traveler for help,  but instead of holding  out a helping hand,  the man stood by  unconcernedly, and  scolded the  boy for  his imprudence.   &quot;Oh, sir!&quot; cried the youth, &quot;pray help me now and scold me afterwards.&quot;</p>
<p>Counsel without help is useless.</p>
<p>The Ass and the Wolf</p>
<p>AN ASS feeding in a meadow saw a Wolf approaching to seize him, and  immediately pretended to be lame.  The Wolf, coming up, inquired the cause of his  lameness. The Ass replied that passing  through a hedge he had  trod with his foot upon  a sharp thorn.  He requested that  the Wolf pull it out,  lest when he ate him  it should injure his throat.   The Wolf consented and  lifted up the foot,  and was giving his  whole mind  to the  discovery of  the thorn,  when the Ass, with his heels, kicked his teeth into his mouth and galloped away.  The Wolf, being  thus fearfully mauled, said, &quot;I am rightly served,  for why did I attempt the art  of healing, when my father only taught me the trade of a butcher?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Seller of Images</p>
<p>A CERTAIN MAN made a wooden image  of Mercury and offered it for sale.   When no one appeared willing  to buy it,  in order to  attract purchasers, he  cried out that he had the statue to sell of a benefactor who bestowed wealth and helped to heap up riches. One of the bystanders  said to him, &quot;My good fellow, why  do you sell him, being such a one as you describe, when you may yourself enjoy the good things he has to give?&#x27;  &quot;Why,&quot; he replied, &quot;I am in need of immediate help, and he is wont to give his good gifts very slowly.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Grapes</p>
<p>A FAMISHED FOX saw some clusters  of ripe black grapes hanging from  a trellised vine.  She resorted  to all her  tricks to get  at them, but  wearied herself in vain,  for  she could  not  reach them.  At  last she  turned  away, hiding  her disappointment and saying: &quot;The Grapes are sour, and not ripe as I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>The Man and His Wife</p>
<p>A MAN had  a Wife who  made herself hated  by all the  members of his household. Wishing to find out if  she had the same effect  on the persons in her  father&#x27;s house, he made some excuse to send her  home on a visit to her father.  After  a short time she  returned, and when  he inquired how  she had got  on and how the servants had treated her,  she replied, &quot;The herdsmen  and shepherds cast on  me looks of aversion.&quot;  He said, &quot;O Wife, if you were disliked by those who go  out early in the morning with their flocks and return late in the evening, what must have been felt towards you by those with whom you passed the whole day!&quot;</p>
<p>Straws show how the wind blows.</p>
<p>The Peacock and Juno</p>
<p>THE PEACOCK made complaint to Juno that, while the nightingale pleased every ear with  his  song,  he  himself  no sooner  opened  his  mouth  than  he became  a laughingstock to all who heard him.  The Goddess, to console him, said, &quot;But you far excel in  beauty and in  size.  The splendor  of the emerald  shines in your neck  and you  unfold a  tail gorgeous  with painted  plumage.&quot;  &quot;But  for what purpose have I,&quot; said the bird, &quot;this  dumb beauty so long as I am  surpassed in song?&#x27;   &quot;The lot of each,&quot; replied Juno, &quot;has been assigned by the will of  the Fates--to thee, beauty; to the eagle, strength; to the nightingale, song; to the raven,  favorable,  and  to  the  crow,  unfavorable  auguries.   These  are all contented with the endowments allotted to them.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hawk and the Nightingale</p>
<p>A NIGHTINGALE, sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to his wont,  was seen by a  Hawk who, being  in need of  food, swooped down  and seized him.  The Nightingale, about to lose  his life, earnestly begged  the Hawk to let  him go, saying that he was  not big enough to  satisfy the hunger of  a Hawk who, if  he wanted food,  ought to  pursue the  larger birds.   The Hawk,  interrupting him, said:  &quot;I should indeed have lost my senses if I should let go food ready in  my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds which are not yet even within sight.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dog, the Cock, and the Fox</p>
<p>A DOG and a  Cock being great friends,  agreed to travel together.  At nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood.   The Cock flying up, perched himself on  the branches of a tree, while the Dog found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk.  When the morning dawned, the Cock, as usual, crowed very loudly several times.  A Fox heard the sound, and  wishing to make a  breakfast on him, came  and stood under the branches, saying how  earnestly he desired to  make the acquaintance of  the owner of  so magnificent  a voice.  The Cock,  suspecting his  civilities, said: &quot;Sir, I wish you would do me the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below me, and waking my porter, so that he may open the door and let you in.&quot; When the Fox approached  the tree,  the Dog  sprang out  and caught  him, and tore him to pieces.</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Goat</p>
<p>A WOLF saw a Goat  feeding at the summit of  a steep precipice, where he  had no chance of reaching her.  He called to her and earnestly begged her to come lower down, lest she fall by some mishap;  and he added that the meadows lay  where he was  standing, and  that the  herbage was  most tender.   She replied,  &quot;No, my friend, it is not for the pasture that you invite me, but for yourself, who  are in want of food.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion and the Bull</p>
<p>A LION,  greatly desiring  to capture  a Bull,  and yet  afraid to attack him on account of his great  size, resorted to a  trick to ensure his  destruction.  He approached the Bull and said, &quot;I have slain a fine sheep, my friend; and if  you will come home  and partake of  him with me,  I shall be  delighted to have your company.&quot;  The Lion said this  in the hope that, as  the Bull was in the  act of reclining to eat, he  might attack him to  advantage, and make his  meal on him. The Bull, on approaching the Lion&#x27;s den, saw the huge spits and giant  caldrons, and no sign whatever of the sheep, and, without saying a word, quietly took  his departure.  The  Lion inquired  why he  went off  so abruptly  without a word of salutation to his host,  who had not given  him any cause for  offense.  &quot;I have reasons enough,&quot; said the  Bull.  &quot;I see no  indication whatever of your  having slaughtered a  sheep, while  I do  see very  plainly every  preparation for your dining on a bull.&quot;</p>
<p>The Goat and the Ass</p>
<p>A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass.  The Goat, envying the Ass on account of  his greater abundance of food, said, &quot;How  shamefully you are treated:  at one  time grinding in the  mill, and at  another carrying heavy  burdens&quot;; and he  further advised him to pretend to be epileptic and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest. The Ass listened to his words, and falling into a ditch, was very much  bruised. His master, sending for  a leech, asked his  advice.  He bade him  pour upon the wounds the lungs  of a Goat.   They at once  killed the Goat,  and so healed the Ass.</p>
<p>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</p>
<p>A COUNTRY MOUSE invited a Town Mouse, an intimate friend, to pay him a visit and partake of his country fare.  As  they were on the bare plowlands,  eating there wheat-stocks and roots pulled up from  the hedgerow, the Town Mouse said  to his friend, &quot;You live here the  life of the ants, while  in my house is the  horn of plenty.  I am  surrounded by every  luxury, and if  you will come  with me, as I wish you  would, you  shall have  an ample  share of  my dainties.&quot;  The Country Mouse  was easily  persuaded, and  returned to  town with  his friend.   On his arrival, the  Town Mouse  placed before  him bread,  barley, beans,  dried figs, honey,  raisins, and,  last of  all, brought  a dainty  piece of  cheese from  a basket.  The  Country Mouse,  being much  delighted at  the sight  of such  good cheer, expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard  fate. Just as they were beginning to eat,  someone opened the door, and they both  ran off squeaking, as fast as  they could, to a hole  so narrow that two could  only find room in it by squeezing.   They had scarcely begun their repast  again when someone else  entered to  take something  out of  a cupboard,  whereupon the two Mice, more frightened  than before, ran  away and hid  themselves.  At last  the Country Mouse, almost famished, said to his friend:  &quot;Although you have prepared for me  so dainty  a feast,  I must  leave you  to enjoy  it by yourself.  It is surrounded by too  many dangers to  please me.  I  prefer my bare  plowlands and roots from the hedgerow, where I can live in safety, and without fear.&quot;</p>
<p>The Wolf, the Fox, and the Ape</p>
<p>A WOLF accused a Fox of theft,  but the Fox entirely denied the charge.   An Ape undertook to adjudge  the matter between  them. When each  had fully stated  his case the Ape announced this sentence:  &quot;I do not think you, Wolf, ever lost what you claim; and I do believe you, Fox, to have stolen what you so stoutly deny.&quot;</p>
<p>The dishonest, if they act honestly, get no credit.</p>
<p>The Fly and the Draught-Mule</p>
<p>A FLY sat on the axle-tree  of a chariot, and addressing the  Draught-Mule said, &quot;How slow you are!  Why do you not  go faster? See if  I do not prick  your neck with my sting.&quot;  The Draught-Mule replied,  &quot;I do not heed your threats;  I only care for him  who sits above  you, and who  quickens my pace  with his whip,  or holds me back with the reins.  Away, therefore, with your insolence, for I  know well when to go fast, and when to go slow.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fishermen</p>
<p>SOME FISHERMEN were out trawling their nets.  Perceiving them to be very  heavy, they danced about for joy and supposed that they had taken a large catch.   When they had dragged the nets to the  shore they found but few fish:  the  nets were full of sand and stones, and the men were beyond measure cast downso much at the disappointment which had  befallen them, but  because they had  formed such very different expectations.  One of their company,  an old man, said, &quot;Let us  cease lamenting, my mates, for, as it seems to me, sorrow is always the twin sister of joy; and it was only to be looked for that we, who just now were  over-rejoiced, should next have something to make us sad.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion and the Three Bulls</p>
<p>THREE BULLS for a long time pastured together.  A Lion lay in ambush in the hope of making them his prey, but was afraid to attack them while they kept together. Having at last  by guileful speeches  succeeded in separating  them, he attacked them without fear as they fed alone, and  feasted on them one by one at his  own leisure.</p>
<p>Union is strength.</p>
<p>The Fowler and the Viper</p>
<p>A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch birds.  Seeing a thrush sitting upon  a tree, he  wished to take  it, and fitting  his twigs to a proper length, watched intently, having his whole thoughts directed towards  the sky.  While thus looking upwards, he  unknowingly trod upon a Viper asleep  just before his feet.  The Viper, turning about, stung him, and falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, &quot;Woe is me! that while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares into the snares of death.&quot;</p>
<p>The Horse and the Ass</p>
<p>A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway. The Ass,  being heavily laden, moved  slowly out of  the way. &quot;Hardly,&quot;  said the Horse,  &quot;can I resist kicking  you with  my heels.&quot;   The Ass  held his  peace, and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods.  Not long afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent  by his owner to  the farm.  The Ass,  seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus  derided him:  &quot;Where, O  boaster, are now all  thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself reduced  to the condition you so lately  treated with contempt?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Mask</p>
<p>A FOX entered the house of  an actor and, rummaging through all  his properties, came upon a Mask, an admirable imitation of a human head.  He placed his paws on it and said, &quot;What a beautiful head! Yet it is of no value, as it entirely lacks brains.&quot;</p>
<p>The Geese and the Cranes</p>
<p>THE GEESE and  the Cranes were  feeding in the  same meadow, when  a birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets.  The Cranes, being light of wing, fled away at his approach;  while the  Geese, being  slower of  flight and  heavier in  their bodies, were captured.</p>
<p>The Blind Man and the Whelp</p>
<p>A BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by touching  them with his hands.   The whelp of  a Wolf was  brought him, with  a request that he would feel it, and say what it was. He felt it, and being in doubt, said:  &quot;I do not quite know whether it is the cub of a Fox, or the whelp of a Wolf, but  this I know full well.  It would not be safe to admit him to the sheepfold.&quot;</p>
<p>Evil tendencies are shown in early life.</p>
<p>The Dogs and the Fox</p>
<p>SOME DOGS, finding  the skin of  a lion, began  to tear it  in pieces with their teeth.  A Fox, seeing them, said, &quot;If this lion were alive, you would soon  find out that his claws were stronger than your teeth.&quot;</p>
<p>It is easy to kick a man that is down.</p>
<p>The Cobbler Turned Doctor</p>
<p>A COBBLER unable to  make a living by  his trade and made  desperate by poverty, began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not known.  He sold a drug, pretending that it was an antidote to all poisons, and obtained a great name for himself by long-winded puffs and  advertisements.  When the Cobbler happened  to fall sick himself of a serious  illness, the Governor of the town  determined to test his skill.  For this purpose he called for a cup, and while filling it with water, pretended to  mix poison with  the Cobbler&#x27;s antidote,  commanding him to drink it  on the  promise of  a reward.   The Cobbler,  under the fear of death, confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine, and was only made famous by  the stupid clamors of  the crowd.  The  Governor then called  a public assembly  and addressed the  citizens:  &quot;Of  what folly  have you  been guilty?  You have  not hesitated to entrust your heads to a man, whom no one could employ to make  even the shoes for their feet.&quot;</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Horse</p>
<p>A WOLF coming out  of a field of  oats met a Horse  and thus addressed him:   &quot;I would advise you to go into that field.   It is full of fine oats, which I  have left untouched for you, as you are  a friend whom I would love to  hear enjoying good eating.&quot;   The Horse  replied, &quot;If  oats had  been the  food of wolves, you would never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly.&quot;</p>
<p>Men of evil reputation,  when they perform a  good deed, fail to  get credit for it.</p>
<p>The Brother and the Sister</p>
<p>A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable for his good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness.   While they were playing one day  as children, they happened by chance to look together into a mirror that was placed on their mother&#x27;s chair.  The boy  congratulated himself on his good looks;  the girl  grew  angry,  and  could  not  bear  the  self-praises  of  her   Brother, interpreting all he said  (and how could she  do otherwise?) into reflection  on herself.   She  ran off  to  her father.   to  be avenged  on  her Brother,  and spitefully accused him of having, as a boy, made use of that which belonged only to girls.  The father embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection impartially on each,  said, &quot;I wish  you both would  look into the  mirror every day:  you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty by evil conduct; and  you, my daughter, that you may make up for your lack of beauty by your virtues.&quot;</p>
<p>The Wasps, the Partridges, and the Farmer</p>
<p>THE  WASPS  and the  Partridges,  overcome with  thirst,  came to  a  Farmer and besought him to give them some water to drink.  They promised amply to repay him the favor which they asked.  The Partridges declared that they would dig  around his vines and make  them produce finer grapes.   The Wasps said that  they would keep guard and drive off thieves with their stings.  But the Farmer  interrupted them, saying:  &quot;I have  already two oxen, who,  without making any promises,  do all these things.  It is surely better for me to give the water to them than  to you.&quot;</p>
<p>The Crow and Mercury</p>
<p>A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, making a vow to  offer some frankincense at his  shrine.  But when rescued  from his danger, he  forgot his promise.  Shortly afterwards, again caught  in a snare, he passed by  Apollo and  made the  same promise  to offer  frankincense to  Mercury.  Mercury  soon appeared and said to him, &quot;O thou most base fellow? how can I believe thee,  who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron?&#x27;</p>
<p>The North Wind and the Sun</p>
<p>THE NORTH  WIND and  the Sun  disputed as  to which  was the  most powerful, and agreed that he should be declared  the victor who could first strip  a wayfaring man of his clothes.  The North Wind first tried his power and blew with all  his might, but  the keener  his blasts,  the closer  the Traveler  wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning  all hope of victory, the Wind  called upon the Sun  to see  what he  could do.   The Sun  suddenly shone  out with  all his warmth.   The Traveler  no sooner  felt his  genial rays  than he  took off  one garment after  another, and  at last,  fairly overcome  with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his path.</p>
<p>Persuasion is better than Force.</p>
<p>The Two Men Who Were Enemies</p>
<p>TWO  MEN,  deadly  enemies to  each  other,  were sailing  in  the  same vessel. Determined to keep as far apart as possible, the one seated himself in the stem, and the other  in the prow  of the ship.   A violent storm  arose, and with  the vessel in great danger  of sinking, the one  in the stern inquired  of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship would go down first.  On his replying that  he supposed it would be the prow, the Man said, &quot;Death would not be grievous to me, if I could only see my Enemy die before me.&quot;</p>
<p>The Gamecocks and the Partridge</p>
<p>A MAN had two Gamecocks in his poultry-yard.  One day by chance he found a  tame Partridge for sale.  He purchased it and  brought it home to be reared with  his Gamecocks.  When the Partridge was put into the poultry-yard, they struck at  it and followed  it about,  so that  the Partridge  became grievously  troubled and supposed that he was  thus evilly treated because  he was a stranger.   Not long afterwards he saw the Cocks fighting together and not separating before one  had well beaten the  other.  He then  said to himself,  &quot;I shall no  longer distress myself at being struck at by these  Gamecocks, when I see that they cannot  even refrain from quarreling with each other.&quot;</p>
<p>The Quack Frog</p>
<p>A FROG once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh and proclaimed  to all the beasts that he was a learned physician, skilled in the use of drugs  and able to heal all diseases.  A Fox  asked him, &quot;How can you pretend to  prescribe for others, when you are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Lion, the Wolf, and the Fox</p>
<p>A LION, growing old, lay sick in  his cave.  All the beasts came to  visit their king,  except the  Fox.  The  Wolf therefore,  thinking that  he had  a capital opportunity, accused the Fox  to the Lion of  not paying any respect  to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to visit him.  At that very  moment the Fox came in and heard these last words of the Wolf.  The Lion roaring out in a rage against him,  the Fox sought an  opportunity to defend himself  and said, &quot;And who of all those who have come to you have benefited you so much as I,  who have traveled from place to place in every direction, and have sought and learnt from  the  physicians  the  means  of  healing  you?&#x27;   The  Lion  commanded him immediately to tell him the cure, when  he replied, &quot;You must flay a wolf  alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you.&quot;  The Wolf was at once taken and  flayed; whereon the Fox, turning to him, said with a smile, &quot;You should have moved  your master not to ill, but to good, will.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dog&#x27;s House</p>
<p>IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as possible on account of the cold, determined to make himself a house.  However when the summer  returned again, he lay asleep stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to  be of a  great size.   Now he  considered that  it would  be neither  an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would accommodate him.</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Lion</p>
<p>ROAMING BY the mountainside at sundown, a Wolf saw his own shadow become greatly extended and magnified, and he said to himself, &quot;Why should I, being of such  an immense size  and extending  nearly an  acre in  length, be  afraid of the Lion? Ought I not to be acknowledged as  King of all the collected beasts?&#x27;  While  he was indulging in these proud thoughts, a Lion fell upon him and killed him.   He exclaimed  with a  too late  repentance, &quot;Wretched  me! this  overestimation of myself is the cause of my destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>The Birds, the Beasts, and the Bat</p>
<p>THE BIRDS waged war with the Beasts,  and each were by turns the conquerors.   A Bat, fearing the uncertain issues of the fight, always fought on the side  which he felt was the strongest.  When peace was proclaimed, his deceitful conduct was apparent  to  both  combatants.   Therefore  being  condemned  by  each  for his treachery, he was driven forth from  the light of day, and henceforth  concealed himself in dark hiding-places, flying always alone and at night.</p>
<p>The Spendthrift and the Swallow</p>
<p>A YOUNG MAN, a great spendthrift, had run through all his patrimony and had  but one good cloak left.  One day he  happened to see a Swallow, which had  appeared before its season, skimming along a pool and twittering gaily.  He supposed that summer had come, and went and sold  his cloak.  Not many days later, winter  set in again with  renewed frost and  cold.  When he  found the unfortunate  Swallow lifeless on  the ground,  he said,  &quot;Unhappy bird!  what have  you done? By thus appearing before the springtime you have not only killed yourself, but you  have wrought my destruction also.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Lion</p>
<p>A FOX saw  a Lion confined  in a cage,  and standing near  him, bitterly reviled him.  The  Lion said  to the  Fox, &quot;It  is not  thou who  revilest me;  but this mischance which has befallen me.&quot;</p>
<p>The Owl and the Birds</p>
<p>AN OWL, in her  wisdom, counseled the Birds  that when the acorn  first began to sprout, to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it to grow.  She  said acorns would produce  mistletoe, from  which an  irremediable poison,  the bird lime, would  be extracted  and by  which they  would be  captured. The  Owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of  the flax, which men had sown, as it  was a plant  which boded  no good  to them.  And, lastly,  the Owl,  seeing an  archer approach, predicted  that this  man, being  on foot,  would contrive darts armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings of the Birds themselves. The Birds gave  no credence  to these  warning words,  but considered  the Owl to be beside herself and  said that she  was mad.  But  afterwards, finding her  words were true, they  wondered at her  knowledge and deemed  her to be  the wisest of birds.  Hence  it is  that when  she appears  they look  to her  as knowing  all things, while she  no longer gives  them advice, but  in solitude laments  their past folly.</p>
<p>The Trumpeter Taken Prisoner</p>
<p>A TRUMPETER, bravely  leading on the  soldiers, was captured  by the enemy.   He cried out to his captors, &quot;Pray spare me, and do not take my life without  cause or without inquiry.   I have not  slain a single  man of your  troop.  I have no arms, and carry nothing but this  one brass trumpet.&quot;  &quot;That is the  very reason for which you should be put to  death,&quot; they said; &quot;for, while you do  not fight yourself, your trumpet stirs all the others to battle.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ass in the Lion&#x27;s Skin</p>
<p>AN ASS, having  put on the  Lion&#x27;s skin, roamed  about in the  forest and amused himself by frightening  all the foolish  animals he met  in his wanderings.   At last coming upon  a Fox, he  tried to frighten  him also, but  the Fox no sooner heard the sound of his than he exclaimed, &quot;I might possibly have been frightened myself, if I had not heard your bray.&quot;</p>
<p>The Sparrow and the Hare</p>
<p>A HARE pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and uttered cries like a child. A Sparrow  upbraided her  and said,  &quot;Where now  is thy  remarkable swiftness of foot? Why were your feet so slow?&quot;  While the Sparrow was thus speaking, a  hawk suddenly seized him and  killed him.  The Hare  was comforted in her  death, and expiring said, &quot;Ah! you who so lately, when you supposed yourself safe,  exulted over my calamity, have now reason to deplore a similar misfortune.&quot;</p>
<p>The Flea and the Ox</p>
<p>A FLEA thus questioned  an Ox:  &quot;What ails  you, that being so  huge and strong, you submit to  the wrongs you  receive from men  and slave for  them day by day, while I, being so  small a creature, mercilessly  feed on their flesh  and drink their blood without stint?&#x27;  The Ox  replied:  &quot;I do not wish to  be ungrateful, for I  am loved  and well  cared for  by men,  and they  often pat  my head  and shoulders.&quot;  &quot;Woe&#x27;s  me!&quot;  said  the flea;  &quot;this very  patting which  you like, whenever it happens to me, brings with it my inevitable destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>The Goods and the Ills</p>
<p>ALL the Goods were once driven out by the Ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind; for the Ills by reason of their numbers  had prevailed to possess the earth. The Goods wafted themselves to heaven and  asked for a  righteous vengeance  on their  persecutors.  They  entreated Jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the Ills, as they had nothing in  common and could not live together, but were engaged in unceasing warfare; and that  an indissoluble  law  might be  laid  down for  their  future protection.   Jupiter granted their  request and  decreed that  henceforth the  Ills should  visit the earth in company with each other, but that the Goods should one by one enter the habitations of men.  Hence it arises that Ills abound, for they come not one  by one,  but in  troops, and  by no  means singly:   while the  Goods proceed  from Jupiter, and are given, not alike to all, but singly, and separately; and one by one to those who are able to discern them.</p>
<p>The Dove and the Crow</p>
<p>A DOVE shut up in  a cage was boasting of  the large number of young  ones which she had hatched.  A  Crow hearing her, said:   &quot;My good friend, cease  from this unseasonable boasting.  The larger the  number of your family, the  greater your cause of sorrow, in seeing them shut up in this prison-house.&quot;</p>
<p>Mercury and the Workmen</p>
<p>A WORKMAN, felling wood by the side of  a river, let his axe drop - by  accident into a deep pool.   Being thus deprived of  the means of his  livelihood, he sat down on the bank and lamented his hard fate.  Mercury appeared and demanded  the cause of his tears. After he  told him his misfortune, Mercury plunged  into the stream, and,  bringing up  a golden  axe, inquired  if that  were the one he had lost.  On his saying that it was not his, Mercury disappeared beneath the  water a second  time, returned  with a  silver axe  in his  hand, and  again asked the Workman if it  were his.  When  the Workman said  it was not,  he dived into the pool for the third time and brought  up the axe that had been lost.  The Workman claimed it  and expressed  his joy  at its  recovery. Mercury,  pleased with his honesty, gave  him the  golden and  silver axes  in addition  to his own.    The Workman, on  his return  to his  house, related  to his  companions all that had happened.  One of them at once resolved to try and secure the same good  fortune for himself.  He ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into the pool  at the same place, and sat down on  the bank to weep. Mercury appeared to  him just as he hoped he  would; and having learned  the cause of his  grief, plunged into the stream  and brought  up a  golden axe,  inquiring if  he had  lost it.   The Workman seized it  greedily, and declared  that truly it  was the very  same axe that he had lost.   Mercury, displeased at his  knavery, not only took  away the golden axe, but refused to recover for him the axe he had thrown into the pool.</p>
<p>The Eagle and the Jackdaw</p>
<p>AN EAGLE, flying  down from his  perch on a  lofty rock, seized  upon a lamb and carried him aloft in  his talons.  A Jackdaw,  who witnessed the capture  of the lamb, was stirred with envy and determined to emulate the strength and flight of the Eagle.  He  flew around with  a great whir  of his wings  and settled upon a large  ram,  with  the intention  of  carrying  him off,  but  his  claws became entangled in the ram&#x27;s fleece and  he was not able to release  himself, although he fluttered with his feathers as  much as he could.  The shepherd,  seeing what had happened, ran up  and caught him.  He  at once clipped the  Jackdaw&#x27;s wings, and  taking him  home at  night, gave  him to  his children.   On their  saying, &quot;Father, what kind of bird is it?&#x27;  he replied, &quot;To my certain knowledge he is a Daw; but he would like you to think an Eagle.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Crane</p>
<p>A FOX invited a Crane to  supper and provided nothing for his  entertainment but some soup made of pulse, which was poured out into a broad flat stone dish.  The soup fell out of the long bill of the Crane at every mouthful, and his  vexation at not being  able to eat  afforded the Fox  much amusement.  The  Crane, in his turn, asked the Fox  to sup with him,  and set before her  a flagon with a  long narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his neck and enjoy its contents  at his leisure.  The  Fox, unable even  to taste it,  met with a  fitting requital, after the fashion of her own hospitality.</p>
<p>Jupiter, Neptune, Minerva, and Momus</p>
<p>ACCORDING to an  ancient legend, the  first man was  made by Jupiter,  the first bull by Neptune,  and the first  house by Minerva.   On the completion  of their labors, a dispute arose as to which had made the most perfect work.  They agreed to appoint Momus as judge, and to abide by his decision.  Momus, however,  being very envious of the handicraft of  each, found fault with all.  He  first blamed the work of  Neptune because he  had not made  the horns of  the bull below  his eyes, so he  might better see  where to strike.   He then condemned  the work of Jupiter,  because he  had not  placed the  heart of  man on  the outside,  that everyone  might read  the thoughts  of the  evil disposed  and take  precautions against  the  intended  mischief.  And,  lastly,  he  inveighed against  Minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in the foundation of her house, so its inhabitants might more easily remove if a neighbor proved unpleasant.   Jupiter, indignant at such inveterate faultfinding,  drove him from his office  of judge, and expelled him from the mansions of Olympus.</p>
<p>The Eagle and the Fox</p>
<p>AN EAGLE and a Fox formed an  intimate friendship and decided to live near  each other.  The Eagle built her nest in  the branches of a tall tree, while  the Fox crept into the underwood and there produced her young.  Not long after they  had agreed upon this plan, the Eagle, being in want of provision for her young ones, swooped down  while the  Fox was  out, seized  upon one  of the little cubs, and feasted herself  and her  brood.  The  Fox on  her return,  discovered what  had happened, but was less grieved for the death of her young than for her inability to  avenge them.   A just  retribution, however,  quickly fell  upon the  Eagle. While hovering near an altar, on  which some villagers were sacrificing a  goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the  flesh, and carried it, along with a  burning cinder, to her nest.   A strong breeze soon  fanned the spark into  a flame, and the eaglets,  as yet  unfledged and  helpless, were  roasted in  their nest  and dropped down dead at the bottom of the tree.  There, in the sight of the  Eagle, the Fox gobbled them up.</p>
<p>The Man and the Satyr</p>
<p>A MAN  and a  Satyr once  drank together  in token  of a  bond of alliance being formed between them.  One very cold wintry day, as they talked, the Man put  his fingers to  his mouth  and blew  on them.   When the  Satyr asked the reason for this, he told him that  he did it to warm  his hands because they were  so cold. Later on  in the  day they  sat down  to eat,  and the  food prepared  was quite scalding.  The Man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and  blew in it.  When the Satyr again inquired the reason, he said that he did it to cool the meat, which was too hot.  &quot;I  can no longer consider you as a  friend,&quot; said the Satyr, &quot;a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ass and His Purchaser</p>
<p>A MAN wished to purchase  an Ass, and agreed with  its owner that he should  try out the animal before he  bought him.  He took the  Ass home and put him  in the straw-yard with his other Asses, upon  which the new animal left all  the others and at once  joined the one  that was most  idle and the  greatest eater of them all. Seeing this, the man put a halter on him and led him back to his owner.  On being asked  how, in  so short  a time,  he could  have made  a trial of him, he answered, &quot;I do not need  a trial; I know that  he will be just the  same as the one he chose for his companion.&quot;</p>
<p>A man is known by the company he keeps.</p>
<p>The Two Bags</p>
<p>EVERY MAN, according to an ancient legend, is born into the world with two  bags suspended from his neck   all bag in front full of his neighbors&#x27; faults, and  a large bag behind filled with his own faults.  Hence it is that men are quick  to see the faults of others, and yet are often blind to their own failings.</p>
<p>The Stag at the Pool</p>
<p>A STAG overpowered  by heat came  to a spring  to drink.  Seeing  his own shadow reflected in the water,  he greatly admired the  size and variety of  his horns, but felt angry with himself for having such slender and weak feet.  While he was thus contemplating himself, a Lion appeared  at the pool and crouched to  spring upon him.  The Stag immediately took  to flight, and exerting his utmost  speed, as long as the plain was smooth and open kept himself easily at a safe  distance from the Lion.  But  entering a wood he  became entangled by his  horns, and the Lion quickly came up to him and  caught him.  When too late, he thus  reproached himself:  &quot;Woe is me!  How I have deceived  myself! These feet which  would have saved  me I  despised, and  I gloried  in these  antlers which  have proved  my destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>What is most truly valuable is often underrated.</p>
<p>The Jackdaw and the Fox</p>
<p>A HALF-FAMISHED JACKDAW  seated himself on  a fig-tree, which  had produced some fruit entirely out of season, and waited in the hope that the figs would  ripen. A Fox seeing him sitting so long  and learning the reason of his doing  so, said to him, &quot;You are indeed, sir, sadly deceiving yourself; you are indulging a hope strong enough to cheat you, but which will never reward you with enjoyment.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lark Burying Her Father</p>
<p>THE LARK (according to an ancient  legend) was created before the earth  itself, and when her  father died, as  there was no  earth, she could  find no place  of burial for him.  She let him lie uninterred for five days, and on the sixth day, not knowing what else to do, she buried him in her own head.  Hence she obtained her crest, which is popularly said to be her father&#x27;s grave-hillock.</p>
<p>Youth&#x27;s first duty is reverence to parents.</p>
<p>The Gnat and the Bull</p>
<p>A GNAT settled on the horn of a Bull, and sat there a long time. Just as he  was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and inquired of the Bull if he  would like him to go.  The Bull replied, &quot;I did not know you had come, and I shall not miss you when you go away.&quot;</p>
<p>Some men are  of more consequence  in their own  eyes than in  the eyes of their neighbors.</p>
<p>The Bitch and Her Whelps</p>
<p>A BITCH, ready to whelp, earnestly begged a shepherd for a place where she might litter.   When her  request was  granted, she  besought permission  to rear  her puppies in the same spot.  The shepherd again consented.  But at last the Bitch, protected by the bodyguard of her Whelps, who had now grown up and were able  to defend  themselves, asserted  her exclusive  right to  the place  and would  not permit the shepherd to approach.</p>
<p>The Dogs and the Hides</p>
<p>SOME DOGS famished  with hunger saw  a number of  cowhides steeping in  a river. Not being able to reach them, they agreed to drink up the river, but it happened that they burst themselves with drinking long before they reached the hides.</p>
<p>Attempt not impossibilities.</p>
<p>The Shepherd and the Sheep</p>
<p>A SHEPHERD  driving his  Sheep to  a wood,  saw an  oak of  unusual size full of acorns, and spreading his cloak under the branches, he climbed up into the  tree and shook them down.  The Sheep eating the acorns inadvertently frayed and  tore the cloak.  When the Shepherd came down  and saw what was done, he said,  &quot;O you most ungrateful creatures! You provide wool to make garments for all other  men, but you destroy the clothes of him who feeds you.&quot;</p>
<p>The Grasshopper and the Owl</p>
<p>AN OWL, accustomed  to feed at  night and to  sleep during the  day, was greatly disturbed by  the noise  of a  Grasshopper and  earnestly besought  her to  stop chirping.  The Grasshopper refused to desist, and chirped louder and louder  the more the Owl entreated. When she saw that she could get no redress and that  her words were despised,  the Owl attacked  the chatterer by  a stratagem. &quot;Since  I cannot sleep,&quot; she said, &quot;on account of your song which, believe me, is sweet as the lyre of Apollo, I shall indulge myself in drinking some nectar which  Pallas lately gave  me.  If  you do  not dislike  it, come  to me  and we will drink it together.&quot; The Grasshopper, who was thirsty, and pleased with the praise of  her voice, eagerly flew up.  The Owl came forth from her hollow, seized her, and put her to death.</p>
<p>The Monkey and the Camel</p>
<p>THE BEASTS of the forest gave a splendid entertainment at which the Monkey stood up  and  danced.  Having  vastly  delighted the  assembly,  he sat  down  amidst universal applause.  The  Camel, envious of  the praises bestowed  on the Monkey and desiring to divert to himself the favor of the guests, proposed to stand  up in  his turn  and dance  for their  amusement.  He  moved about  in so  utterly ridiculous a manner that the Beasts, in a fit of indignation, set upon him  with clubs and drove him out of the assembly.</p>
<p>It is absurd to ape our betters.</p>
<p>The Peasant and the Apple-Tree</p>
<p>A PEASANT had in his garden an Apple-Tree which bore no fruit but only served as a harbor for  the sparrows and  grasshoppers.  He resolved  to cut it  down, and taking his axe in his hand, made  a bold stroke at its roots.  The  grasshoppers and sparrows entreated him not to cut down the tree that sheltered them, but  to spare  it, and  they would  sing to  him and  lighten his  labors. He  paid no attention to their request, but gave the tree a second and a third blow with his axe.  When he  reached the hollow  of the tree,  he found a  hive full of honey. Having tasted the honeycomb, he threw down  his axe, and looking on the tree  as sacred, took great care of it.</p>
<p>Self-interest alone moves some men.</p>
<p>The Two Soldiers and the Robber</p>
<p>TWO SOLDIERS traveling together were set  upon by a Robber.  The one  fled away; the other stood his ground and defended himself with his stout right hand.   The Robber being slain,  the timid companion  ran up and  drew his sword,  and then, throwing back  his traveling  cloak said,  &quot;I&#x27;ll at  him, and  I&#x27;ll take care he shall learn whom he has attacked.&quot;  On  this, he who had fought with the  Robber made answer, &quot;I only wish that you had  helped me just now, even if it had  been only with those  words, for I  should have been  the more encouraged,  believing them to be true; but now put up  your sword in its sheath and hold your  equally useless tongue, till you can deceive others who do not know you.  I, indeed, who have  experienced  with  what  speed  you run  away,  know  right  well  that no dependence can be placed on your valor.&quot;</p>
<p>The Trees Under the Protection of the Gods</p>
<p>THE GODS, according  to an ancient  legend, made choice  of certain trees  to be under their special protection.  Jupiter chose the oak, Venus the myrtle, Apollo the laurel, Cybele  the pine, and  Hercules the poplar.   Minerva, wondering why they  had preferred  trees not  yielding fruit,  inquired the  reason for  their choice. Jupiter replied, &quot;It is lest we  should seem to covet the honor for  the fruit.&quot;  But said Minerva, &quot;Let anyone say  what he will the olive is more  dear to  me on  account of  its fruit.&quot;   Then said  Jupiter, &quot;My  daughter, you  are rightly called wise; for unless what we do is useful, the glory of it is vain.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mother and the Wolf</p>
<p>A FAMISHED  WOLF was  prowling about  in the  morning in  search of food.  As he passed the door of a cottage built in  the forest, he heard a Mother say to  her child, &quot;Be quiet, or I will throw you out of the window, and the Wolf shall  eat you.&quot;  The Wolf sat all  day waiting at the door.   In the evening he heard  the same woman fondling her child and saying:   &quot;You are quiet now, and if the  Wolf should come,  we will  kill him.&quot;   The Wolf,  hearing these  words, went  home, gasping with cold and hunger.  When  he reached his den, Mistress Wolf  inquired of him  why he  returned wearied  and supperless,  so contrary  to his wont.  He replied:  &quot;Why, forsooth! use I gave credence to the words of a woman!&quot;</p>
<p>The Ass and the Horse</p>
<p>AN ASS besought a Horse  to spare him a small  portion of his feed. &quot;Yes,&quot;  said the Horse; &quot;if any remains  out of what I am  now eating I will give  it you for the sake of my own  superior dignity, and if you  will come when I reach  my own stall in the evening, I  will give you a little  sack full of barley.&quot;  The  Ass replied, &quot;Thank you.  But I can&#x27;t think that you, who refuse me a little  matter now.  will by and by confer on me a greater benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>Truth and the Traveler</p>
<p>A  WAYFARING  MAN, traveling  in  the desert,  met  a woman  standing  alone and terribly dejected.  He inquired of her, &quot;Who art thou?&quot; &quot;My name is Truth,&quot;  she replied.  &quot;And for what cause,&quot; he asked, &quot;have you left the city to dwell alone here in the  wilderness?&quot; She made  answer, &quot;Because in  former times, falsehood was with few, but is now with all men.&quot;</p>
<p>The Manslayer</p>
<p>A MAN committed a murder,  and was pursued by the  relations of the man whom  he murdered.  On his reaching the  river Nile he saw a  Lion on its bank and  being fearfully afraid, climbed up a tree. He found a serpent in the upper branches of the tree,  and again  being greatly  alarmed, he  threw himself  into the river, where a  crocodile caught  him and  ate him.   Thus the  earth, the air, and the water alike refused shelter to a murderer.</p>
<p>The Lion and the Fox</p>
<p>A FOX  entered into  partnership with  a Lion  on the  pretense of  becoming his servant.  Each undertook his proper duty  in accordance with his own nature  and powers.  The Fox discovered and pointed out the prey; the Lion sprang on it  and seized it.  The Fox  soon became  jealous of  the Lion  carrying off  the Lion&#x27;s share, and said that he would no longer find out the prey, but would capture  it on his own account.  The next day  he attempted to snatch a lamb from  the fold, but he himself fell prey to the huntsmen and hounds.</p>
<p>The Lion and the Eagle</p>
<p>AN EAGLE stayed his flight and entreated a Lion to make an alliance with him  to their mutual advantage.  The  Lion replied, &quot;I have  no objection, but you  must excuse me for requiring you  to find surety for your  good faith, for how can  I trust anyone as a friend  who is able to fly  away from his bargain whenever  he pleases?&#x27;</p>
<p>Try before you trust.</p>
<p>The Hen and the Swallow</p>
<p>A HEN finding  the eggs of  a viper and  carefully keeping them  warm, nourished them  into life.   A Swallow,  observing what  she had  done, said,  &quot;You silly creature! why have you hatched these  vipers which, when they shall have  grown, will inflict injury on all, beginning with yourself?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Buffoon and the Countryman</p>
<p>A RICH NOBLEMAN once opened the theaters without charge to the people, and  gave a public notice that  he would handsomely reward  any person who invented  a new amusement for the occasion. Various  public performers contended for the  prize. Among them came a Buffoon well known among the populace for his jokes, and  said that he  had a  kind of  entertainment which  had never  been brought out on any stage before.  This report being spread about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded in every part. The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without any  apparatus or  confederates, and  the very  sense of  expectation caused  an intense silence.  He suddenly bent his  head towards his bosom and imitated  the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice that the audience declared he had  a porker  under his  cloak, and  demanded that  it should be shaken out. When that was done and nothing was found, they cheered the actor, and loaded him with the loudest applause.   A Countryman in the  crowd, observing all that  has passed, said, &quot;So help me, Hercules, he  shall not beat me at that trick!&quot;   and at once proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day, though in  a much more  natural way.   On the  morrow a  still larger  crowd assembled in the theater, but now partiality for  their favorite actor very generally  prevailed, and  the  audience  came rather  to  ridicule  the Countryman  than  to  see the spectacle.  Both of the performers  appeared on the stage.  The  Buffoon grunted and squeaked away first, and obtained, as on the preceding day, the applause and cheers of the spectators.  Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a  little pig  beneath his  clothes (which  in truth  he did,  but not suspected by  the audience  ) contrived  to take  hold of  and to  pull his  ear causing the pig to squeak.  The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent  that the  Buffoon  had  given  a  far more  exact  imitation,  and  clamored  for the Countryman to be  kicked out of  the theater.  On  this the rustic  produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the most positive proof the greatness of their mistake.  &quot;Look here,&quot; he said, &quot;this shows what sort of judges you are.&quot;</p>
<p>The Crow and the Serpent</p>
<p>A CROW in great want  of food saw a Serpent  asleep in a sunny nook,  and flying down, greedily  seized him.   The Serpent,  turning about,  bit the  Crow with a mortal wound.  In the  agony of death, the  bird exclaimed:  &quot;O unhappy  me! who have  found  in  that  which  I  deemed  a  happy  windfall  the  source  of  my destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>The Hunter and the Horseman</p>
<p>A CERTAIN HUNTER, having snared a hare, placed it upon his shoulders and set out homewards.  On his  way he met  a man on  horseback who begged  the hare of him, under the pretense of purchasing it.   However, when the Horseman got the  hare, he rode off as fast as he could.  The Hunter ran after him, as if he was sure of overtaking him, but  the Horseman increased  more and more  the distance between them.  The Hunter,  sorely against his  will, called out  to him and  said, &quot;Get along with you! for I will now make you a present of the hare.&quot;</p>
<p>The King&#x27;s Son and the Painted Lion</p>
<p>A KING, whose only son  was fond of martial exercises,  had a dream in which  he was warned that his son would be killed by a lion. Afraid the dream should prove true, he  built for  his son  a pleasant  palace and  adorned its  walls for his amusement with all kinds of life-sized animals, among which was the picture of a lion.  When the young  Prince saw this, his  grief at being thus  confined burst out afresh,  and, standing  near the  lion, he  said: &quot;O  you most detestable of animals! through a lying dream of my  father&#x27;s, which he saw in his sleep,  I am shut up on your account  in this palace as if  I had been a girl:   what shall I now do to  you?&#x27;  With  these words  he stretched  out his  hands toward a thorn tree, meaning to cut a stick from  its branches so that he might beat  the lion. But one  of the  tree&#x27;s prickles  pierced his  finger and  caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young Prince  fell down in a fainting fit.   A violent fever suddenly set in, from which he died not many days later.</p>

<p>The Cat and Venus</p>
<p>A CAT fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus to change  her into the form of  a woman.  Venus consented  to her request and  transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the  youth saw her and loved her, and  took her home as his bride. While the two were reclining in their chamber, Venus  wishing to discover if  the Cat in  her change of  shape had also  altered her habits of life, let down a mouse in the middle of the room.  The Cat, quite forgetting her present condition, started up from the  couch and pursued the mouse, wishing  to eat it.   Venus was  much disappointed  and again  caused her  to return  to her former shape.</p>

<p>The She-Goats and Their Beards</p>
<p>THE SHE-GOATS having obtained a beard  by request to Jupiter, the He-Goats  were sorely displeased and made complaint  that the females equaled them  in dignity. &quot;Allow them,&quot; said Jupiter, &quot;to enjoy an empty honor and to assume the badge  of your nobler sex, so long as they are not your equals in strength or courage.&quot;</p>
<p>It matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should be like us  in outside appearances.</p>
<p>The Camel and the Arab</p>
<p>AN ARAB CAMEL-DRIVER, after completing the loading of his Camel, asked him which he would like best, to go up hill or down.  The poor beast replied, not  without a touch of reason:   &quot;Why do you ask  me? Is it that  the level way through  the desert is closed?&quot;</p>
<p>The Miller, His Son, and Their Ass</p>
<p>A MILLER and his son were driving  their Ass to a neighboring fair to  sell him. They had not  gone far when  they met with  a troop of  women collected round  a well, talking and laughing.  &quot;Look there,&quot; cried one of them, &quot;did you ever  see such fellows, to be trudging along the road on foot when they might ride?&#x27;   The old man hearing this, quickly made his son mount the Ass, and continued to  walk along merrily by  his side.  Presently  they came up  to a group  of old men  in earnest debate.   &quot;There,&quot; said  one of  them, &quot;it  proves what  I was a-saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad  riding while his old father  has to walk? Get  down, you young scapegrace,  and let the old man rest his weary limbs.&quot;  Upon this the old man made his son dismount, and got up  himself.  In  this manner  they had  not proceeded  far when  they met a company of women and children: &quot;Why, you lazy old fellow,&quot; cried several tongues at once, &quot;how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there  can hardly keep pace by the side of you?&#x27;  The good-natured Miller immediately  took up his son behind him.  They  had now almost reached the town.     &quot;Pray, honest friend,&quot; said a citizen,  &quot;is that Ass your  own?&#x27;  &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the  old man. &quot;O, one would not have  thought so,&quot; said the other,  &quot;by the way you load  him. Why, you  two fellows  are better  able to  carry the  poor beast  than he you.&quot; &quot;Anything to please  you,&quot; said the  old man; &quot;we  can but try.&quot;   So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him  on their shoulders over  a bridge near the  entrance to the town. This entertaining sight brought  the people in crowds to laugh  at it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was  subject to, broke the  cords that bound  him and, tumbling  off the pole,  fell into the river.  Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased  nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain.</p>
<p>The Crow and the Sheep</p>
<p>A TROUBLESOME  CROW seated  herself on  the back  of a  Sheep.  The  Sheep, much against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long time, and at  last said, &quot;If you  had treated a  dog in this  way, you would  have had your deserts from his sharp teeth.&quot; To this the  Crow replied, &quot;I despise the weak and  yield to the strong.   I know whom  I may bully  and whom I  must flatter; and  I thus prolong my life to a good old age.&quot;</p>
<p>The Fox and the Bramble</p>
<p>A FOX was mounting a hedge when he lost his footing and caught hold of a Bramble to save himself.  Having  pricked and grievously tom  the soles of his  feet, he accused the Bramble  because, when he  had fled to  her for assistance,  she had used him worse than the hedge itself.  The Bramble, interrupting him, said, &quot;But you really must have been  out of your senses to  fasten yourself on me, who  am myself always accustomed to fasten upon others.&quot;</p>
<p>The Wolf and the Lion</p>
<p>A WOLF, having stolen a lamb from a  fold, was carrying him off to his lair.   A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took it from him.  Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, &quot;You have unrighteously taken that which  was mine from me!&quot;  To which the Lion jeeringly replied, &quot;It was righteously  yours, eh? The gift of a friend?&#x27;</p>
<p>The Dog and the Oyster</p>
<p>A DOG, used to eating eggs, saw  an Oyster and, opening his mouth to  its widest extent, swallowed it  down with the  utmost relish, supposing  it to be  an egg. Soon afterwards suffering  great pain in  his stomach, he  said, &quot;I deserve  all this torment, for my folly in thinking that everything round must be an egg.&quot;</p>
<p>They  who  act without  sufficient  thought, will  often  fall into  unsuspected danger.</p>
<p>The Ant and the Dove</p>
<p>AN ANT went to the bank of a river to quench its thirst, and being carried  away by the rush of the  stream, was on the point  of drowning.  A Dove sitting  on a tree overhanging the water plucked a leaf and let it fall into the stream  close to her.  The  Ant climbed onto  it and floated  in safety to  the bank.  Shortly afterwards a birdcatcher came and stood under the tree, and laid his  lime-twigs for the Dove, which sat in the branches.  The Ant, perceiving his design,  stung him in the foot.   In pain the birdcatcher  threw down the twigs,  and the noise made the Dove take wing.</p>
<p>The Partridge and the Fowler</p>
<p>A FOWLER caught a Partridge and  was about to kill it.  The  Partridge earnestly begged him to  spare his life,  saying, &quot;Pray, master,  permit me to  live and I will entice many  Partridges to you  in recompense for  your mercy to  me.&quot;  The Fowler replied, &quot;I shall now with  less scruple take your life, because  you are willing to save it at the cost of betraying your friends and relations.&quot;</p>
<p>The Flea and the Man</p>
<p>A MAN, very much annoyed with a Flea, caught him at last, and said, &quot;Who are you who dare to feed on my limbs, and  to cost me so much trouble in catching  you?&#x27; The Flea replied, &quot;O my dear sir, pray spare my life, and destroy me not, for  I cannot possibly do you much harm.&quot;   The Man, laughing, replied, &quot;Now you  shall certainly die  by mine  own hands,  for no  evil, whether  it be small or large, ought to be tolerated.&quot;</p>
<p>The Thieves and the Cock</p>
<p>SOME THIEVES broke into a house and  found nothing but a Cock, whom they  stole, and got off as fast as they could.  Upon arriving at home they prepared to  kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life:  &quot;Pray spare me; I am very  serviceable to men.  I wake them up in the  night to their work.&quot;  &quot;That is the very  reason why we must the more kill you,&quot; they replied; &quot;for when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to our business.&quot;</p>
<p>The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions.</p>
<p>The Dog and the Cook</p>
<p>A  RICH  MAN  gave  a  great  feast,  to  which  he  invited  many  friends  and acquaintances.  His  Dog availed  himself of  the occasion  to invite a stranger Dog, a friend of his, saying, &quot;My master gives a feast, and there is always much food remaining; come and sup with me tonight.&quot;  The Dog thus invited went at the hour appointed, and seeing the preparations for so grand an entertainment,  said in the joy of his heart, &quot;How glad I  am that I came! I do not often get  such a chance as  this.  I  will take  care and  eat enough  to last  me both today and tomorrow.&quot;  While he was congratulating  himself and wagging his tail  to convey his pleasure to his friend, the Cook saw him moving about among his dishes  and, seizing him by his fore and hind  paws, bundled him without ceremony out of  the window.  He fell with force upon the ground and limped away, howling dreadfully. His yelling soon attracted  other street dogs, who  came up to him  and inquired how he had enjoyed his supper.  He replied, &quot;Why, to tell you the truth, I drank so much  wine that  I remember  nothing.  I  do not  know how  I got  out of the house.&quot;</p>
<p>The Travelers and the Plane-Tree</p>
<p>TWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer&#x27;s sun, laid themselves down at noon under the widespreading branches of a Plane-Tree.  As they rested under its shade, one of the Travelers said  to the other, &quot;What a singularly  useless tree is the Plane! It bears no fruit, and  is not of the least service to man.&quot;   The Plane-Tree,  interrupting  him, said,  &quot;You  ungrateful fellows!  Do  you, while receiving benefits from me  and resting under my  shade, dare to describe  me as useless, and unprofitable?&#x27;</p>
<p>Some men underrate their best blessings.</p>
<p>The Hares and the Frogs</p>
<p>THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of the  perpetual alarm to which they  were exposed, with one  accord determined to put  an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty precipice into a deep lake below.  As they scampered off in  large numbers to carry out their  resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks  of the lake heard the  noise of their feet and  rushed helter-skelter to the deep water for safety.  On seeing the rapid  disappearance of the Frogs, one of the Hares cried out to his companions:  &quot;Stay, my  friends, do not do  as you intended;  for you now  see that there  are creatures who  are still more timid than ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant</p>
<p>THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints.  &quot;It is true, O Jupiter!&quot; he said, &quot;that  I am gigantic  in strength, handsome  in shape, and  powerful in attack.  I have jaws  well provided with teeth,  and feet furnished with  claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest, and what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should  be frightened by the crowing of a  cock.&quot;  Jupiter replied,  &quot;Why do  you blame  me without  a cause?  I have  given you  all the attributes which I possess  myself, and your courage  never fails you except  in this one instance.&quot;   On hearing this  the Lion groaned  and lamented very  much and, reproaching himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die. As  these thoughts passed through his  mind, he met an  Elephant and came close  to hold a conversation with him.   After a time  he observed that  the Elephant shook  his ears very often, and he inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor  every now and  then.  Just at  that moment a  Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied, &quot;Do you see that little buzzing insect? If it enters my ear, my fate is  sealed.  I should die presently.&quot;  The Lion  said, &quot;Well, since so huge a beast is afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more  complain, nor  wish myself  dead.  I  find myself,  even as  I am,  better off  than the Elephant.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lamb and the Wolf</p>
<p>A WOLF  pursued a  Lamb, which  fled for  refuge to  a certain  Temple. The Wolf called out to him and said, &quot;The Priest will slay you in sacrifice, if he should catch  you.&quot;  On  which the  Lamb replied,  &quot;It would  be better  for me  to be sacrificed in the Temple than to be eaten by you.&quot;</p>
<p>The Rich Man and the Tanner</p>
<p>A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the unpleasant  smell of the tan-yard,  he pressed his  neighbor to go  away.  The Tanner  put off his departure from time to time, saying that  he would leave soon.  But as he  still continued to stay, as time went on, the rich man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of inconvenience, made no further complaints.</p>
<p>The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea</p>
<p>A  SHIPWRECKED MAN,  having been  cast upon  a certain  shore, slept  after his buffetings with the  deep.  After a  while he awoke,  and looking upon  the Sea, loaded it with reproaches.  He argued  that it enticed men with the  calmness of its looks, but when it  had induced them to plow  its waters, it grew rough  and destroyed them.  The Sea, assuming the  form of a woman, replied to  him: &quot;Blame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for  I am by my own nature as calm and  firm even as this earth; but the winds suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into fury.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mules and the Robbers</p>
<p>TWO  MULES well-laden  with packs  were trudging  along.  One  carried panniers filled with money, the  other sacks weighted with  grain. The Mule carrying  the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of the value of his burden, and tossed up and down  the clear-toned bells fastened  to his neck.  His  companion followed with quiet  and easy step.   All of a  sudden Robbers rushed  upon them from their hiding-places, and in the  scuffle with their owners, wounded with  a sword the Mule carrying the treasure, which they greedily seized while taking no notice of the  grain. The Mule  which had been  robbed and wounded  bewailed his misfortunes.  The other replied, &quot;I am indeed glad that I was thought so  little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with any wound.&quot;</p>
<p>The Viper and the File</p>
<p>A LION, entering  the workshop of  a smith, sought  from the tools  the means of satisfying his hunger.   He more particularly  addressed himself to  a File, and asked of  him the  favor of  a meal.   The File  replied, &quot;You  must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get anything from me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to give anything in return.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lion and the Shepherd</p>
<p>A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn.  Soon afterward he came  up to a  Shepherd and  fawned upon  him, wagging  his tail  as if  to say,  &quot;I am a suppliant,  and  seek  your  aid.&quot;   The  Shepherd  boldly  examined  the beast, discovered the  thorn, and  placing his  paw upon  his lap,  pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion  returned into the forest.  Some time  after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false  accusation, was condemned &quot;to be cast  to the Lions&quot;  as the  punishment for  his imputed  crime.  But  when the  Lion was released from his cage,  he recognized the Shepherd  as the man who  healed him, and instead of attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap.   The King, as soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in the forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends.</p>
<p>The Camel and Jupiter</p>
<p>THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull  adorned with horns, envied him and wished  that he himself could obtain the same  honors.  He went to Jupiter, and  besought him to give him horns.  Jupiter, vexed  at his request because he was  not satisfied with his size and  strength of body, and  desired yet more, not  only refused to give him horns, but even deprived him of a portion of his ears.</p>
<p>The Panther and the Shepherds</p>
<p>A PANTHER, by some  mischance, fell into a  pit.  The Shepherds discovered  him, and some threw  sticks at him  and pelted him  with stones, while  others, moved with compassion towards  one about to  die even though  no one should  hurt him, threw  in some  food to  prolong his  life.  At  night they  returned home,  not dreaming of any  danger, but supposing  that on the  morrow they would  find him dead.  The Panther,  however, when he  had recruited his  feeble strength, freed himself with a  sudden bound from  the pit, and  hastened to his  den with rapid steps.  After a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and,  killing the Shepherds who had  attacked him, raged with  angry fury.  Then they  who had spared his life, fearing for their  safety, surrendered to him their flocks  and begged only for their lives.  To them the Panther made this reply:  &quot;I  remember alike those who sought  my life with stones,  and those who gave  me food aside, therefore, your fears.  I return as an enemy only to those who injured me.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ass and the Charger</p>
<p>AN ASS  congratulated a  Horse on  being so  ungrudgingly and carefully provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even that without  hard work.  But when war  broke out, a heavily  armed soldier mounted the  Horse, and riding him to the  charge, rushed into the  very midst of the  enemy.  The Horse was wounded and fell  dead on the battlefield.   Then the Ass, seeing  all these things, changed his mind, and commiserated the Horse.</p>
<p>The Eagle and His Captor</p>
<p>AN EAGLE was once captured by a  man, who immediately clipped his wings and  put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief.  Later, another neighbor purchased him and allowed  his feathers  to grow  again.  The  Eagle took  flight, and  pouncing upon  a hare, brought  it at  once as  an offering  to his  benefactor.  A  Fox, seeing  this, exclaimed, &quot;Do not cultivate  the favor of this  man, but of your  former owner, lest he should again hunt for you and deprive you a second time of your wings.&quot;</p>
<p>The Bald Man and the Fly</p>
<p>A FLY  bit the  bare head  of a  Bald Man  who, endeavoring  to destroy it, gave himself a heavy slap.  Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, &quot;You who have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect, see what you have done  to yourself to add  insult to injury?&#x27;   The Bald Man  replied, &quot;I can  easily make peace with myself, because I know there  was no intention to hurt.  But you,  an ill-favored and contemptible insect who delights in sucking human blood, I  wish that I could have killed you even if I had incurred a heavier penalty.&quot;</p>
<p>The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree</p>
<p>THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all the  year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons.  A shower of snow  fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage, it settled upon its  branches and broke them  down with its  weight, at once  despoiling it of  its beauty and killing the tree.   But finding the  Fig-Tree denuded of  leaves, the snow  fell through to the ground, and did not injure it at all.</p>
<p>The Eagle and the Kite</p>
<p>AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with  sorrow, sat upon the  branches of a tree  in company with a Kite.  &quot;Why,&quot; said the Kite, &quot;do I see you with such a rueful look?&#x27;   &quot;I seek,&quot; she  replied, &quot;a  mate suitable  for me,  and am  not able  to find one.&quot; &quot;Take me,&quot; returned the Kite, &quot;I am much stronger than you are.&quot;  &quot;Why, are  you able to secure the means of living by your plunder?&#x27;  &quot;Well, I have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons.&quot;  The Eagle, persuaded by these words, accepted him as her mate.  Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, &quot;Fly  off and bring me back  the ostrich you promised  me.&quot;  The Kite, soaring  aloft into the air, brought back the shabbiest possible mouse, stinking from the length  of time it had  lain about the  fields.  &quot;Is this,&quot;  said the Eagle,  &quot;the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?&#x27;  The Kite replied, &quot;That I might attain your royal hand, there is nothing that I would not have promised, however much I knew that I must fail in the performance.&quot;</p>
<p>The Ass and His Driver</p>
<p>AN ASS, being driven along a high  road, suddenly started off and bolted to  the brink of a deep  precipice.  While he was  in the act of  throwing himself over, his owner seized him  by the tail, endeavoring  to pull him back.   When the Ass persisted in his effort, the man let  him go and said, &quot;Conquer, but conquer  to your cost.&quot;</p>
<p>The Thrush and the Fowler</p>
<p>A THRUSH  was feeding  on a  myrtle-tree and  did not  move from  it because its berries were so delicious.  A Fowler  observed her staying so long in  one spot, and having  well bird-limed  his reeds,  caught her.   The Thrush,  being at the point of  death, exclaimed,  &quot;O foolish  creature that  I am!  For the sake of a little pleasant food I have deprived myself of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>The Rose and the Amaranth</p>
<p>AN AMARANTH planted in  a garden near a  Rose-Tree, thus addressed it:   &quot;What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favorite alike with Gods and with men.  I envy  you your beauty  and your  perfume.&quot;  The  Rose replied,  &quot;I indeed,  dear Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season! If no  cruel hand pluck me from my stem, yet  I must perish by an  early doom.  But thou  art immortal and dost  never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed youth.&quot;</p>
<p>The Frogs&#x27; Complaint Against the Sun</p>
<p>ONCE UPON A TIME, when the Sun announced his intention to take a wife, the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. Jupiter, disturbed by the noise  of their croaking, inquired the cause of  their complaint.  One of them said,  &quot;The Sun,  now while  he is  single, parches  up the  marsh, and  compels us  to die miserably in our  arid homes.  What  will be our  future condition if  he should beget other suns?&#x27;</p>
