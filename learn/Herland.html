If I could have brought with me the material I so carefully prepared, this would be a very different story.  Whole books full of notes, carefully copied records, firsthand descriptions, and the pictures--that&#x27;s the worst loss.  We had some bird&#x27;s-eyes of the cities and parks; a lot of lovely views of streets, of buildings, outside and in, and some of those gorgeous gardens, and, most important of all, of the women themselves.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Nobody will ever believe how they looked.  Descriptions aren&#x27;t any good when it comes to women, and I never was good at descriptions anyhow.  But it&#x27;s got to be done somehow; the rest of the world needs to know about that country.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I haven&#x27;t said where it was for fear some self-appointed missionaries, or traders, or land-greedy expansionists, will take it upon themselves to push in.  They will not be wanted, I can tell them that, and will fare worse than we did if they do find it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It began this way.  There were three of us, classmates and friends--Terry O. Nicholson (we used to call him the Old Nick, with good reason), Jeff Margrave, and I, Vandyck Jennings.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had known each other years and years, and in spite of our differences we had a good deal in common.  All of us were interested in science.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was rich enough to do as he pleased.  His great aim was exploration.  He used to make all kinds of a row because there was nothing left to explore now, only patchwork and filling in, he said.  He filled in well enough--he had a lot of talents--great on mechanics and electricity.  Had all kinds of boats and motorcars, and was one of the best of our airmen.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We never could have done the thing at all without Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff Margrave was born to be a poet, a botanist--or both--but his folks persuaded him to be a doctor instead.  He was a good one, for his age, but his real interest was in what he loved to call &quot;the wonders of science.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As for me, sociology&#x27;s my major.  You have to back that up with a lot of other sciences, of course.  I&#x27;m interested in them all.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was strong on facts--geography and meteorology and those; Jeff could beat him any time on biology, and I didn&#x27;t care what it was they talked about, so long as it connected with human life, somehow.  There are few things that don&#x27;t.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We three had a chance to join a big scientific expedition.  They needed a doctor, and that gave Jeff an excuse for dropping his just opening practice; they needed Terry&#x27;s experience, his machine, and his money; and as for me, I got in through Terry&#x27;s influence.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The expedition was up among the thousand tributaries and enormous hinterland of a great river, up where the maps had to be made, savage dialects studied, and all manner of strange flora and fauna expected.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But this story is not about that expedition.  That was only the merest starter for ours.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> My interest was first roused by talk among our guides.  I&#x27;m quick at languages, know a good many, and pick them up readily. What with that and a really good interpreter we took with us, I made out quite a few legends and folk myths of these scattered tribes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And as we got farther and farther upstream, in a dark tangle of rivers, lakes, morasses, and dense forests, with here and there an unexpected long spur running out from the big mountains beyond, I noticed that more and more of these savages had a story about a strange and terrible Woman Land in the high distance.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Up yonder,&quot; &quot;Over there,&quot; &quot;Way up&quot;--was all the direction they could offer, but their legends all agreed on the main point --that there was this strange country where no men lived--only women and girl children.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> None of them had ever seen it.  It was dangerous, deadly, they said, for any man to go there.  But there were tales of long ago, when some brave investigator had seen it--a Big Country, Big Houses, Plenty People--All Women.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Had no one else gone?  Yes--a good many--but they never came back.  It was no place for men--of that they seemed sure.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I told the boys about these stories, and they laughed at them. Naturally I did myself.  I knew the stuff that savage dreams are made of.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But when we had reached our farthest point, just the day before we all had to turn around and start for home again, as the best of expeditions must in time, we three made a discovery.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The main encampment was on a spit of land running out into the main stream, or what we thought was the main stream.  It had the same muddy color we had been seeing for weeks past, the same taste.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I happened to speak of that river to our last guide, a rather superior fellow with quick, bright eyes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He told me that there was another river--&quot;over there, short river, sweet water, red and blue.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I was interested in this and anxious to see if I had understood, so I showed him a red and blue pencil I carried, and asked again.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Yes, he pointed to the river, and then to the southwestward. &quot;River--good water--red and blue.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was close by and interested in the fellow&#x27;s pointing.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;What does he say, Van?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I told him.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry blazed up at once.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Ask him how far it is.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The man indicated a short journey; I judged about two hours, maybe three.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Let&#x27;s go,&quot; urged Terry.  &quot;Just us three.  Maybe we can really find something.  May be cinnabar in it.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;May be indigo,&quot; Jeff suggested, with his lazy smile.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was early yet; we had just breakfasted; and leaving word that we&#x27;d be back before night, we got away quietly, not wishing to be thought too gullible if we failed, and secretly hoping to have some nice little discovery all to ourselves.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was a long two hours, nearer three.  I fancy the savage could have done it alone much quicker.  There was a desperate tangle of wood and water and a swampy patch we never should have found our way across alone.  But there was one, and I could see Terry, with compass and notebook, marking directions and trying to place landmarks.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We came after a while to a sort of marshy lake, very big, so that the circling forest looked quite low and dim across it.  Our guide told us that boats could go from there to our camp--but &quot;long way--all day.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This water was somewhat clearer than that we had left, but we could not judge well from the margin.  We skirted it for another half hour or so, the ground growing firmer as we advanced, and presently we turned the corner of a wooded promontory and saw a quite different country--a sudden view of mountains, steep and bare.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;One of those long easterly spurs,&quot; Terry said appraisingly. &quot;May be hundreds of miles from the range.  They crop out like that.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Suddenly we left the lake and struck directly toward the cliffs.  We heard running water before we reached it, and the guide pointed proudly to his river.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was short.  We could see where it poured down a narrow vertical cataract from an opening in the face of the cliff.  It was sweet water.  The guide drank eagerly and so did we.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That&#x27;s snow water,&quot; Terry announced.  &quot;Must come from way back in the hills.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But as to being red and blue--it was greenish in tint.  The guide seemed not at all surprised.  He hunted about a little and showed us a quiet marginal pool where there were smears of red along the border; yes, and of blue.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry got out his magnifying glass and squatted down to investigate.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Chemicals of some sort--I can&#x27;t tell on the spot.  Look to me like dyestuffs.  Let&#x27;s get nearer,&quot; he urged, &quot;up there by the fall.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We scrambled along the steep banks and got close to the pool that foamed and boiled beneath the falling water.  Here we searched the border and found traces of color beyond dispute. More--Jeff suddenly held up an unlooked-for trophy.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was only a rag, a long, raveled fragment of cloth.  But it was a well-woven fabric, with a pattern, and of a clear scarlet that the water had not faded.  No savage tribe that we had heard of made such fabrics.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The guide stood serenely on the bank, well pleased with our excitement.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;One day blue--one day red--one day green,&quot; he told us, and pulled from his pouch another strip of bright-hued cloth.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Come down,&quot; he said, pointing to the cataract.  &quot;Woman Country--up there.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then we were interested.  We had our rest and lunch right there and pumped the man for further information.  He could tell us only what the others had--a land of women--no men--babies, but all girls.  No place for men--dangerous.  Some had gone to see--none had come back.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I could see Terry&#x27;s jaw set at that.  No place for men? Dangerous?  He looked as if he might shin up the waterfall on the spot. But the guide would not hear of going up, even if there had been any possible method of scaling that sheer cliff, and we had to get back to our party before night.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They might stay if we told them,&quot; I suggested.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But Terry stopped in his tracks.  &quot;Look here, fellows,&quot; he said. &quot;This is our find.  Let&#x27;s not tell those cocky old professors.  Let&#x27;s go on home with &#x27;em, and then come back--just us--have a little expedition of our own.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We looked at him, much impressed.  There was something attractive to a bunch of unattached young men in finding an undiscovered country of a strictly Amazonian nature.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course we didn&#x27;t believe the story--but yet!</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;There is no such cloth made by any of these local tribes,&quot; I announced, examining those rags with great care.  &quot;Somewhere up yonder they spin and weave and dye--as well as we do.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That would mean a considerable civilization, Van.  There couldn&#x27;t be such a place--and not known about.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Oh, well, I don&#x27;t know.  What&#x27;s that old republic up in the Pyrenees somewhere--Andorra?  Precious few people know anything about that, and it&#x27;s been minding its own business for a thousand years.  Then there&#x27;s Montenegro--splendid little state--you could lose a dozen Montenegroes up and down these great ranges.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We discussed it hotly all the way back to camp.  We discussed it with care and privacy on the voyage home.  We discussed it after that, still only among ourselves, while Terry was making his arrangements.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He was hot about it.  Lucky he had so much money--we might have had to beg and advertise for years to start the thing, and then it would have been a matter of public amusement--just sport for the papers.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But T. O. Nicholson could fix up his big steam yacht, load his specially-made big motorboat aboard, and tuck in a &quot;dissembled&quot; biplane without any more notice than a snip in the society column.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had provisions and preventives and all manner of supplies. His previous experience stood him in good stead there.  It was a very complete little outfit.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We were to leave the yacht at the nearest safe port and go up that endless river in our motorboat, just the three of us and a pilot; then drop the pilot when we got to that last stopping place of the previous party, and hunt up that clear water stream ourselves.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">The motorboat we were going to leave at anchor in that wide shallow lake.

Now we had no eavesdroppers, we could loll and loaf in our deck chairs and talk and talk--there was nothing else to do.  Our absolute lack of facts only made the field of discussion wider.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We&#x27;ll leave papers with our consul where the yacht stays,&quot; Terry planned.  &quot;If we don&#x27;t come back in--say a month--they can send a relief party after us.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;A punitive expedition,&quot; I urged.  &quot;If the ladies do eat us we must make reprisals.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They can locate that last stopping place easy enough, and I&#x27;ve made a sort of chart of that lake and cliff and waterfall.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Yes, but how will they get up?&quot; asked Jeff.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Same way we do, of course.  If three valuable American citizens are lost up there, they will follow somehow--to say nothing of the glittering attractions of that fair land--let&#x27;s call it `Feminisia,&#x27;&quot; he broke off.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You&#x27;re right, Terry.  Once the story gets out, the river will crawl with expeditions and the airships rise like a swarm of mosquitoes.&quot; I laughed as I thought of it.  &quot;We&#x27;ve made a great mistake not to let Mr. Yellow Press in on this.

I think he thought that country--if there was one--was just blossoming with roses and babies and canaries and tidies, and all that sort of thing.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And Terry, in his secret heart, had visions of a sort of sublimated summer resort--just Girls and Girls and Girls--and that he was going to be--well, Terry was popular among women even when there were other men around, and it&#x27;s not to be wondered at that he had pleasant dreams of what might happen.  I could see it in his eyes as he lay there, looking at the long blue rollers slipping by, and fingering that impressive mustache of his.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But I thought--then--that I could form a far clearer idea of what was before us than either of them.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You&#x27;re all off, boys,&quot; I insisted.  &quot;If there is such a place--and there does seem some foundation for believing it--you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s built on a sort of matriarchal principle, that&#x27;s all.  The men have a separate cult of their own, less socially developed than the women, and make them an annual visit--a sort of wedding call. This is a condition known to have existed--here&#x27;s just a survival. They&#x27;ve got some peculiarly isolated valley or tableland up there, and their primeval customs have survived.

Jeff idealized women in the best Southern style.  He was full of chivalry and sentiment, and all that.  And he was a good boy; he lived up to his ideals.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> You might say Terry did, too, if you can call his views about women anything so polite as ideals.  I always liked Terry.  He was a man&#x27;s man, very much so, generous and brave and clever; but I don&#x27;t think any of us in college days was quite pleased to have him with our sisters.  We weren&#x27;t very stringent, heavens no!  But Terry was &quot;the limit.&quot;  Later on--why, of course a man&#x27;s life is his own, we held, and asked no questions.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But barring a possible exception in favor of a not impossible wife, or of his mother, or, of course, the fair relatives of his friends, Terry&#x27;s idea seemed to be that pretty women were just so much game and homely ones not worth considering.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was really unpleasant sometimes to see the notions he had.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But I got out of patience with Jeff, too.  He had such rose- colored halos on his womenfolks.  I held a middle ground, highly scientific, of course, and used to argue learnedly about the physiological limitations of the sex.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We were not in the least &quot;advanced&quot; on the woman question, any of us, then.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we joked and disputed and speculated, and after an interminable journey, we got to our old camping place at last.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was not hard to find the river, just poking along that side till we came to it, and it was navigable as far as the lake.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> When we reached that and slid out on its broad glistening bosom, with that high gray promontory running out toward us, and the straight white fall clearly visible, it began to be really exciting.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There was some talk, even then, of skirting the rock wall and seeking a possible footway up, but the marshy jungle made that method look not only difficult but dangerous.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry dismissed the plan sharply.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Nonsense, fellows!  We&#x27;ve decided that.  It might take months--we haven&#x27;t got the provisions.  No, sir--we&#x27;ve got to take our chances.  If we get back safe--all right.  If we don&#x27;t, why, we&#x27;re not the first explorers to get lost in the shuffle.  There are plenty to come after us.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we got the big biplane together and loaded it with our scientifically compressed baggage: the camera, of course; the glasses; a supply of concentrated food.  Our pockets were magazines of small necessities, and we had our guns, of course-- there was no knowing what might happen.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Up and up and up we sailed, way up at first, to get &quot;the lay of the land&quot; and make note of it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Out of that dark green sea of crowding forest this high- standing spur rose steeply.  It ran back on either side, apparently, to the far-off white-crowned peaks in the distance, themselves probably inaccessible.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Let&#x27;s make the first trip geographical,&quot; I suggested. &quot;Spy out the land, and drop back here for more gasoline. With your tremendous speed we can reach that range and back all right.  Then we can leave a sort of map on board-- for that relief expedition.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&quot;There&#x27;s sense in that,&quot; Terry agreed.  &quot;I&#x27;ll put off being king of Ladyland for one more day.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we made a long skirting voyage, turned the point of the cape which was close by, ran up one side of the triangle at our best speed, crossed over the base where it left the higher mountains, and so back to our lake by moonlight.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That&#x27;s not a bad little kingdom,&quot; we agreed when it was roughly drawn and measured.  We could tell the size fairly by our speed.  And from what we could see of the sides--and that icy ridge at the back end--&quot;It&#x27;s a pretty enterprising savage who would manage to get into it,&quot; Jeff said.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course we had looked at the land itself--eagerly, but we were too high and going too fast to see much.  It appeared to be well forested about the edges, but in the interior there were wide plains, and everywhere parklike meadows and open places.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There were cities, too; that I insisted.  It looked--well, it looked like any other country--a civilized one, I mean.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had to sleep after that long sweep through the air, but we turned out early enough next day, and again we rose softly up the height till we could top the crowning trees and see the broad fair land at our pleasure.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Semitropical.  Looks like a first-rate climate.  It&#x27;s wonderful what a little height will do for temperature.&quot;  Terry was studying the forest growth.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Little height!  Is that what you call little?&quot; I asked.  Our instruments measured it clearly.  We had not realized the long gentle rise from the coast perhaps.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Mighty lucky piece of land, I call it,&quot; Terry pursued. &quot;Now for the folks--I&#x27;ve had enough scenery.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we sailed low, crossing back and forth, quartering the country as we went, and studying it.  We saw--I can&#x27;t remember now how much of this we noted then and how much was supplemented by our later knowledge, but we could not help seeing this much, even on that excited day--a land in a state of perfect cultivation, where even the forests looked as if they were cared for; a land that looked like an enormous park, only it was even more evidently an enormous garden.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I don&#x27;t see any cattle,&quot; I suggested, but Terry was silent.  We were approaching a village.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I confess that we paid small attention to the clean, well-built roads, to the attractive architecture, to the ordered beauty of the little town.  We had our glasses out; even Terry, setting his machine for a spiral glide, clapped the binoculars to his eyes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They heard our whirring screw.  They ran out of the houses --they gathered in from the fields, swift-running light figures, crowds of them.  We stared and stared until it was almost too late to catch the levers, sweep off and rise again; and then we held our peace for a long run upward</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Gosh!&quot; said Terry, after a while.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Only women there--and children,&quot; Jeff urged excitedly.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;But they look--why, this is a CIVILIZED country!&quot; I protested. &quot;There must be men.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Of course there are men,&quot; said Terry.  &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s find &#x27;em.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He refused to listen to Jeff&#x27;s suggestion that we examine the country further before we risked leaving our machine.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;There&#x27;s a fine landing place right there where we came over,&quot; he insisted, and it was an excellent one--a wide, flattopped rock, overlooking the lake, and quite out of sight from the interior.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They won&#x27;t find this in a hurry,&quot; he asserted, as we scrambled with the utmost difficulty down to safer footing.  &quot;Come on, boys-- there were some good lookers in that bunch.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course it was unwise of us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was quite easy to see afterward that our best plan was to have studied the country more fully before we left our swooping airship and trusted ourselves to mere foot service.  But we were three young men.  We had been talking about this country for over a year, hardly believing that there was such a place, and now --we were in it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It looked safe and civilized enough, and among those upturned, crowding faces, though some were terrified enough, there was great beauty--on that we all agreed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Come on!&quot; cried Terry, pushing forward.  &quot;Oh, come on!

In other conditions we should have found those woods full of fair foresters and fruit gatherers; but an airship is a conspicuous object, and by no means quiet--and women are cautious.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> All we found moving in those woods, as we started through them, were birds, some gorgeous, some musical, all so tame that it seemed almost to contradict our theory of cultivation--at least until we came upon occasional little glades, where carved stone seats and tables stood in the shade beside clear fountains, with shallow bird baths always added.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They don&#x27;t kill birds, and apparently they do kill cats,&quot; Terry declared.  &quot;MUST be men here.  Hark!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had heard something: something not in the least like a birdsong, and very much like a suppressed whisper of laughter --a little happy sound, instantly smothered.  We stood like so many pointers, and then used our glasses, swiftly, carefully.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It couldn&#x27;t have been far off,&quot; said Terry excitedly. &quot;How about this big tree?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There was a very large and beautiful tree in the glade we had just entered, with thick wide-spreading branches that sloped out in lapping fans like a beech or pine.  It was trimmed underneath some twenty feet up, and stood there like a huge umbrella, with circling seats beneath.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Look,&quot; he pursued.  &quot;There are short stumps of branches left to climb on.  There&#x27;s someone up that tree, I believe.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We stole near, cautiously.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Look out for a poisoned arrow in your eye,&quot; I suggested, but Terry pressed forward, sprang up on the seat-back, and grasped the trunk. &quot;In my heart, more likely,&quot; he answered.  &quot;Gee!  Look, boys!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We rushed close in and looked up.  There among the boughs overhead was something--more than one something--that clung motionless, close to the great trunk at first, and then, as one and all we started up the tree, separated into three swift-moving figures and fled upward.  As we climbed we could catch glimpses of them scattering above us.  By the time we had reached about as far as three men together dared push, they had left the main trunk and moved outward, each one balanced on a long branch that dipped and swayed beneath the weight.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We paused uncertain.  If we pursued further, the boughs would break under the double burden.  We might shake them off, perhaps, but none of us was so inclined.  In the soft dappled light of these high regions, breathless with our rapid climb, we rested awhile, eagerly studying our objects of pursuit; while they in turn, with no more terror than a set of frolicsome children in a game of tag, sat as lightly as so many big bright birds on their precarious perches and frankly, curiously, stared at us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Girls!&quot; whispered Jeff, under his breath, as if they might fly if he spoke aloud.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Peaches!&quot; added Terry, scarcely louder.  &quot;Peacherinos-- apricot-nectarines!  Whew!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They were girls, of course, no boys could ever have shown that sparkling beauty, and yet none of us was certain at first.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We saw short hair, hatless, loose, and shining; a suit of some light firm stuff, the closest of tunics and kneebreeches, met by trim gaiters.  As bright and smooth as parrots and as unaware of danger, they swung there before us, wholly at ease, staring as we stared, till first one, and then all of them burst into peals of delighted laughter.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then there was a torrent of soft talk tossed back and forth; no savage sing-song, but clear musical fluent speech.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We met their laughter cordially, and doffed our hats to them, at which they laughed again, delightedly.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then Terry, wholly in his element, made a polite speech, with explanatory gestures, and proceeded to introduce us, with pointing finger.  &quot;Mr. Jeff Margrave,&quot; he said clearly; Jeff bowed as gracefully as a man could in the fork of a great limb.  &quot;Mr. Vandyck Jennings&quot;--I also tried to make an effective salute and nearly lost my balance.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then Terry laid his hand upon his chest--a fine chest he had, too, and introduced himself; he was braced carefully for the occasion and achieved an excellent obeisance.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Again they laughed delightedly, and the one nearest me followed his tactics.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Celis,&quot; she said distinctly, pointing to the one in blue; &quot;Alima&quot;--the one in rose; then, with a vivid imitation of Terry&#x27;s impressive manner, she laid a firm delicate hand on her gold- green jerkin--&quot;Ellador.&quot;  This was pleasant, but we got no nearer.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We can&#x27;t sit here and learn the language,&quot; Terry protested. He beckoned to them to come nearer, most winningly--but they gaily shook their heads.  He suggested, by signs, that we all go down together; but again they shook their heads, still merrily. Then Ellador clearly indicated that we should go down, pointing to each and all of us, with unmistakable firmness; and further seeming to imply by the sweep of a lithe arm that we not only go downward, but go away altogether--at which we shook our heads in turn.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Have to use bait,&quot; grinned Terry.  &quot;I don&#x27;t know about you fellows, but I came prepared.&quot;  He produced from an inner pocket a little box of purple velvet, that opened with a snap--and out of it he drew a long sparkling thing, a necklace of big varicolored stones that would have been worth a million if real ones.  He held it up, swung it, glittering in the sun, offered it first to one, then to another, holding it out as far as he could reach toward the girl nearest him.  He stood braced in the fork, held firmly by one hand --the other, swinging his bright temptation, reached far out along the bough, but not quite to his full stretch.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She was visibly moved, I noted, hesitated, spoke to her companions. They chattered softly together, one evidently warning her, the other encouraging.  Then, softly and slowly, she drew nearer. This was Alima, a tall long-limbed lass, well-knit and evidently both strong and agile.  Her eyes were splendid, wide, fearless, as free from suspicion as a child&#x27;s who has never been rebuked. Her interest was more that of an intent boy playing a fascinating game than of a girl lured by an ornament.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The others moved a bit farther out, holding firmly, watching. Terry&#x27;s smile was irreproachable, but I did not like the look in his eyes--it was like a creature about to spring.  I could already see it happen--the dropped necklace, the sudden clutching hand, the girl&#x27;s sharp cry as he seized her and drew her in.  But it didn&#x27;t happen.  She made a timid reach with her right hand for the gay swinging thing--he held it a little nearer--then, swift as light, she seized it from him with her left, and dropped on the instant to the bough below.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He made his snatch, quite vainly, almost losing his position as his hand clutched only air; and then, with inconceivable rapidity, the three bright creatures were gone.  They dropped from the ends of the big boughs to those below, fairly pouring themselves off the tree, while we climbed downward as swiftly as we could. We heard their vanishing gay laughter, we saw them fleeting away in the wide open reaches of the forest, and gave chase, but we might as well have chased wild antelopes; so we stopped at length somewhat breathless.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;No use,&quot; gasped Terry.  &quot;They got away with it.  My word! The men of this country must be good sprinters!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Inhabitants evidently arboreal,&quot; I grimly suggested. &quot;Civilized and still arboreal--peculiar people.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t have tried that way,&quot; Jeff protested.  &quot;They were perfectly friendly; now we&#x27;ve scared them.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But it was no use grumbling, and Terry refused to admit any mistake.  &quot;Nonsense,&quot; he said.  &quot;They expected it.  Women like to be run after.  Come on, let&#x27;s get to that town; maybe we&#x27;ll find them there.  Let&#x27;s see, it was in this direction and not far from the woods, as I remember.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> When we reached the edge of the open country we reconnoitered with our field glasses.  There it was, about four miles off, the same town, we concluded, unless, as Jeff ventured, they all had pink houses.  The broad green fields and closely cultivated gardens sloped away at our feet, a long easy slant, with good roads winding pleasantly here and there, and narrower paths besides.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Look at that!&quot; cried Jeff suddenly.  &quot;There they go!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Sure enough, close to the town, across a wide meadow, three bright-hued figures were running swiftly.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;How could they have got that far in this time?  It can&#x27;t be the same ones,&quot; I urged.  But through the glasses we could identify our pretty tree-climbers quite plainly, at least by costume.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry watched them, we all did for that matter, till they disappeared among the houses.  Then he put down his glass and turned to us, drawing a long breath.  &quot;Mother of Mike, boys--what Gorgeous Girls!  To climb like that! to run like that! and afraid of nothing.  This country suits me all right.  Let&#x27;s get ahead.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Nothing venture, nothing have,&quot; I suggested, but Terry preferred &quot;Faint heart ne&#x27;er won fair lady.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We set forth in the open, walking briskly.  &quot;If there are any men, we&#x27;d better keep an eye out,&quot; I suggested, but Jeff seemed lost in heavenly dreams, and Terry in highly practical plans.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;What a perfect road!  What a heavenly country!  See the flowers, will you?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This was Jeff, always an enthusiast; but we could agree with him fully.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The road was some sort of hard manufactured stuff, sloped slightly to shed rain, with every curve and grade and gutter as perfect as if it were Europe&#x27;s best.  &quot;No men, eh?&quot; sneered Terry. On either side a double row of trees shaded the footpaths; between the trees bushes or vines, all fruit-bearing, now and then seats and little wayside fountains; everywhere flowers.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We&#x27;d better import some of these ladies and set &#x27;em to parking the United States,&quot; I suggested.  &quot;Mighty nice place they&#x27;ve got here.&quot;  We rested a few moments by one of the fountains, tested the fruit that looked ripe, and went on, impressed, for all our gay bravado by the sense of quiet potency which lay about us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here was evidently a people highly skilled, efficient, caring for their country as a florist cares for his costliest orchids.  Under the soft brilliant blue of that clear sky, in the pleasant shade of those endless rows of trees, we walked unharmed, the placid silence broken only by the birds.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Presently there lay before us at the foot of a long hill the town or village we were aiming for.  We stopped and studied it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff drew a long breath.  &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have believed a collection of houses could look so lovely,&quot; he said.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They&#x27;ve got architects and landscape gardeners in plenty, that&#x27;s sure,&quot; agreed Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I was astonished myself.  You see, I come from California, and there&#x27;s no country lovelier, but when it comes to towns--!  I have often groaned at home to see the offensive mess man made in the face of nature, even though I&#x27;m no art sharp, like Jeff.  But this place!  It was built mostly of a sort of dull rose-colored stone, with here and there some clear white houses; and it lay abroad among the green groves and gardens like a broken rosary of pink coral.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Those big white ones are public buildings evidently,&quot; Terry declared.  &quot;This is no savage country, my friend.  But no men? Boys, it behooves us to go forward most politely.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The place had an odd look, more impressive as we approached. &quot;It&#x27;s like an exposition.&quot;  &quot;It&#x27;s too pretty to be true.&quot; &quot;Plenty of palaces, but where are the homes?&quot;  &quot;Oh there are little ones enough--but--.&quot;  It certainly was different from any towns we had ever seen.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;There&#x27;s no dirt,&quot; said Jeff suddenly.  &quot;There&#x27;s no smoke, &quot;he added after a little.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;There&#x27;s no noise,&quot; I offered; but Terry snubbed me--&quot;That&#x27;s because they are laying low for us; we&#x27;d better be careful how we go in there.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Nothing could induce him to stay out, however, so we walked on.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Everything was beauty, order, perfect cleanness, and the pleasantest sense of home over it all.  As we neared the center of the town the houses stood thicker, ran together as it were, grew into rambling palaces grouped among parks and open squares, something as college buildings stand in their quiet greens.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And then, turning a corner, we came into a broad paved space and saw before us a band of women standing close together in even order, evidently waiting for us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We stopped a moment and looked back.  The street behind was closed by another band, marching steadily, shoulder to shoulder.  We went on--there seemed no other way to go--and presently found ourselves quite surrounded by this close-massed multitude, women, all of them, but--</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They were not young.  They were not old.  They were not, in the girl sense, beautiful.  They were not in the least ferocious. And yet, as I looked from face to face, calm, grave, wise, wholly unafraid, evidently assured and determined, I had the funniest feeling--a very early feeling--a feeling that I traced back and back in memory until I caught up with it at last.  It was that sense of being hopelessly in the wrong that I had so often felt in early youth when my short legs&#x27; utmost effort failed to overcome the fact that I was late to school.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff felt it too; I could see he did.  We felt like small boys, very small boys, caught doing mischief in some gracious lady&#x27;s house. But Terry showed no such consciousness.  I saw his quick eyes darting here and there, estimating numbers, measuring distances, judging chances of escape.  He examined the close ranks about us, reaching back far on every side, and murmured softly to me, &quot;Every one of &#x27;em over forty as I&#x27;m a sinner.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Yet they were not old women.  Each was in the full bloom of rosy health, erect, serene, standing sure-footed and light as any pugilist. They had no weapons, and we had, but we had no wish to shoot.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I&#x27;d as soon shoot my aunts,&quot; muttered Terry again.  &quot;What do they want with us anyhow?  They seem to mean business.&quot; But in spite of that businesslike aspect, he determined to try his favorite tactics.  Terry had come armed with a theory.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He stepped forward, with his brilliant ingratiating smile, and made low obeisance to the women before him.  Then he produced another tribute, a broad soft scarf of filmy texture, rich in color and pattern, a lovely thing, even to my eye, and offered it with a deep bow to the tall unsmiling woman who seemed to head the ranks before him.  She took it with a gracious nod of acknowledgment, and passed it on to those behind her.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He tried again, this time bringing out a circlet of rhinestones, a glittering crown that should have pleased any woman on earth. He made a brief address, including Jeff and me as partners in his enterprise, and with another bow presented this.  Again his gift was accepted and, as before, passed out of sight.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;If they were only younger,&quot; he muttered between his teeth. &quot;What on earth is a fellow to say to a regiment of old Colonels like this?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> In all our discussions and speculations we had always unconsciously assumed that the women, whatever else they might be, would be young.  Most men do think that way, I fancy.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Woman&quot; in the abstract is young, and, we assume, charming. As they get older they pass off the stage, somehow, into private ownership mostly, or out of it altogether.  But these good ladies were very much on the stage, and yet any one of them might have been a grandmother.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We looked for nervousness--there was none.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> For terror, perhaps--there was none.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> For uneasiness, for curiosity, for excitement--and all we saw was what might have been a vigilance committee of women doctors, as cool as cucumbers, and evidently meaning to take us to task for being there.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Six of them stepped forward now, one on either side of each of us, and indicated that we were to go with them.  We thought it best to accede, at first anyway, and marched along, one of these close at each elbow, and the others in close masses before, behind, on both sides.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> A large building opened before us, a very heavy thick-walled impressive place, big, and old-looking; of gray stone, not like the rest of the town.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;This won&#x27;t do!&quot; said Terry to us, quickly.  &quot;We mustn&#x27;t let them get us in this, boys.  All together, now--&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We stopped in our tracks.  We began to explain, to make signs pointing away toward the big forest--indicating that we would go back to it--at once.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It makes me laugh, knowing all I do now, to think of us three boys--nothing else; three audacious impertinent boys--butting into an unknown country without any sort of a guard or defense. We seemed to think that if there were men we could fight them, and if there were only women--why, they would be no obstacles at all.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff, with his gentle romantic old-fashioned notions of women as clinging vines.  Terry, with his clear decided practical theories that there were two kinds of women--those he wanted and those he didn&#x27;t; Desirable and Undesirable was his demarcation. The latter as a large class, but negligible--he had never thought about them at all.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And now here they were, in great numbers, evidently indifferent to what he might think, evidently determined on some purpose of their own regarding him, and apparently well able to enforce their purpose.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We all thought hard just then.  It had not seemed wise to object to going with them, even if we could have; our one chance was friendliness--a civilized attitude on both sides.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But once inside that building, there was no knowing what these determined ladies might do to us.  Even a peaceful detention was not to our minds, and when we named it imprisonment it looked even worse.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we made a stand, trying to make clear that we preferred the open country.  One of them came forward with a sketch of our flier, asking by signs if we were the aerial visitors they had seen.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This we admitted.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They pointed to it again, and to the outlying country, in different directions--but we pretended we did not know where it was, and in truth we were not quite sure and gave a rather wild indication of its whereabouts.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Again they motioned us to advance, standing so packed about the door that there remained but the one straight path open.  All around us and behind they were massed solidly--there was simply nothing to do but go forward--or fight.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We held a consultation.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I never fought with women in my life,&quot; said Terry, greatly perturbed, &quot;but I&#x27;m not going in there.  I&#x27;m not going to be-- herded in--as if we were in a cattle chute.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We can&#x27;t fight them, of course,&quot; Jeff urged.  &quot;They&#x27;re all women, in spite of their nondescript clothes; nice women, too; good strong sensible faces.  I guess we&#x27;ll have to go in.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We may never get out, if we do,&quot; I told them.  &quot;Strong and sensible, yes; but I&#x27;m not so sure about the good.  Look at those faces!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had stood at ease, waiting while we conferred together, but never relaxing their close attention.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Their attitude was not the rigid discipline of soldiers; there was no sense of compulsion about them.  Terry&#x27;s term of a &quot;vigilance committee&quot; was highly descriptive.  They had just the aspect of sturdy burghers, gathered hastily to meet some common need or peril, all moved by precisely the same feelings, to the same end.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Never, anywhere before, had I seen women of precisely this quality. Fishwives and market women might show similar strength, but it was coarse and heavy.  These were merely athletic--light and powerful.  College professors, teachers, writers--many women showed similar intelligence but often wore a strained nervous look, while these were as calm as cows, for all their evident intellect.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We observed pretty closely just then, for all of us felt that it was a crucial moment.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The leader gave some word of command and beckoned us on, and the surrounding mass moved a step nearer.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We&#x27;ve got to decide quick,&quot; said Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I vote to go in,&quot; Jeff urged.  But we were two to one against him and he loyally stood by us.  We made one more effort to be let go, urgent, but not imploring.  In vain.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Now for a rush, boys!&quot; Terry said.  &quot;And if we can&#x27;t break &#x27;em, I&#x27;ll shoot in the air.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then we found ourselves much in the position of the suffragette trying to get to the Parliament buildings through a triple cordon of London police.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The solidity of those women was something amazing.  Terry soon found that it was useless, tore himself loose for a moment, pulled his revolver, and fired upward.  As they caught at it, he fired again--we heard a cry--.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Instantly each of us was seized by five women, each holding arm or leg or head; we were lifted like children, straddling helpless children, and borne onward, wriggling indeed, but most ineffectually.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We were borne inside, struggling manfully, but held secure most womanfully, in spite of our best endeavors.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So carried and so held, we came into a high inner hall, gray and bare, and were brought before a majestic gray-haired woman who seemed to hold a judicial position.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There was some talk, not much, among them, and then suddenly there fell upon each of us at once a firm hand holding a wetted cloth before mouth and nose--an order of swimming sweetness--anesthesia.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                        CHAPTER 3</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                 A Peculiar Imprisonment</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> From a slumber as deep as death, as refreshing as that of a healthy child, I slowly awakened.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was like rising up, up, up through a deep warm ocean, nearer and nearer to full light and stirring air.  Or like the return to consciousness after concussion of the brain.  I was once thrown from a horse while on a visit to a wild mountainous country quite new to me, and I can clearly remember the mental experience of coming back to life, through lifting veils of dream.  When I first dimly heard the voices of those about me, and saw the shining snowpeaks of that mighty range, I assumed that this too would pass, and I should presently find myself in my own home.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> That was precisely the experience of this awakening: receding waves of half-caught swirling vision, memories of home, the steamer, the boat, the airship, the forest--at last all sinking away one after another, till my eyes were wide open, my brain clear, and I realized what had happened.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The most prominent sensation was of absolute physical comfort. I was lying in a perfect bed: long, broad, smooth; firmly soft and level; with the finest linen, some warm light quilt of blanket, and a counterpane that was a joy to the eye.  The sheet turned down some fifteen inches, yet I could stretch my feet at the foot of the bed free but warmly covered.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I felt as light and clean as a white feather.  It took me some time to conscientiously locate my arms and legs, to feel the vivid sense of life radiate from the wakening center to the extremities.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> A big room, high and wide, with many lofty windows whose closed blinds let through soft green-lit air; a beautiful room, in proportion, in color, in smooth simplicity; a scent of blossoming gardens outside.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I lay perfectly still, quite happy, quite conscious, and yet not actively realizing what had happened till I heard Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Gosh!&quot; was what he said.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I turned my head.  There were three beds in this chamber, and plenty of room for them.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was sitting up, looking about him, alert as ever.  His remark, though not loud, roused Jeff also.  We all sat up.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry swung his legs out of bed, stood up, stretched himself mightily.  He was in a long nightrobe, a sort of seamless garment, undoubtedly comfortable--we all found ourselves so covered. Shoes were beside each bed, also quite comfortable and goodlooking though by no means like our own.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We looked for our clothes--they were not there, nor anything of all the varied contents of our pockets.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> A door stood somewhat ajar; it opened into a most attractive bathroom, copiously provided with towels, soap, mirrors, and all such convenient comforts, with indeed our toothbrushes and combs, our notebooks, and thank goodness, our watches--but no clothes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then we made a search of the big room again and found a large airy closet, holding plenty of clothing, but not ours.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;A council of war!&quot; demanded Terry.  &quot;Come on back to bed --the bed&#x27;s all right anyhow.  Now then, my scientific friend, let us consider our case dispassionately.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He meant me, but Jeff seemed most impressed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They haven&#x27;t hurt us in the least!&quot; he said.  &quot;They could have killed us--or--or anything--and I never felt better in my life.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That argues that they are all women,&quot; I suggested, &quot;and highly civilized.  You know you hit one in the last scrimmage-- I heard her sing out--and we kicked awfully.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was grinning at us.  &quot;So you realize what these ladies have done to us?&quot; he pleasantly inquired.  &quot;They have taken away all our possessions, all our clothes--every stitch.  We have been stripped and washed and put to bed like so many yearling babies--by these highly civilized women.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff actually blushed.  He had a poetic imagination.  Terry had imagination enough, of a different kind.  So had I, also different. I always flattered myself I had the scientific imagination, which, incidentally, I considered the highest sort.  One has a right to a certain amount of egotism if founded on fact--and kept to one&#x27;s self--I think.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;No use kicking, boys,&quot; I said.  &quot;They&#x27;ve got us, and apparently they&#x27;re perfectly harmless.  It remains for us to cook up some plan of escape like any other bottled heroes.  Meanwhile we&#x27;ve got to put on these clothes--Hobson&#x27;s choice.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The garments were simple in the extreme, and absolutely comfortable, physically, though of course we all felt like supes in the theater.  There was a one-piece cotton undergarment, thin and soft, that reached over the knees and shoulders, something like the one-piece pajamas some fellows wear, and a kind of half-hose, that came up to just under the knee and stayed there --had elastic tops of their own, and covered the edges of the first.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then there was a thicker variety of union suit, a lot of them in the closet, of varying weights and somewhat sturdier material --evidently they would do at a pinch with nothing further.  Then there were tunics, knee-length, and some long robes.  Needless to say, we took tunics.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We bathed and dressed quite cheerfully.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Not half bad,&quot; said Terry, surveying himself in a long mirror. His hair was somewhat longer than when we left the last barber, and the hats provided were much like those seen on the prince in the fairy tale, lacking the plume.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The costume was similar to that which we had seen on all the women, though some of them, those working in the fields, glimpsed by our glasses when we first flew over, wore only the first two.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I settled my shoulders and stretched my arms, remarking: &quot;They have worked out a mighty sensible dress, I&#x27;ll say that for them.&quot;  With which we all agreed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Now then,&quot; Terry proclaimed, &quot;we&#x27;ve had a fine long sleep --we&#x27;ve had a good bath--we&#x27;re clothed and in our right minds, though feeling like a lot of neuters.  Do you think these highly civilized ladies are going to give us any breakfast?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Of course they will,&quot; Jeff asserted confidently.  &quot;If they had meant to kill us, they would have done it before.  I believe we are going to be treated as guests.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Hailed as deliverers, I think,&quot; said Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Studied as curiosities,&quot; I told them.  &quot;But anyhow, we want food. So now for a sortie!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> A sortie was not so easy.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The bathroom only opened into our chamber, and that had but one outlet, a big heavy door, which was fastened.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We listened.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;There&#x27;s someone outside,&quot; Jeff suggested.  &quot;Let&#x27;s knock.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we knocked, whereupon the door opened.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Outside was another large room, furnished with a great table at one end, long benches or couches against the wall, some smaller tables and chairs.  All these were solid, strong, simple in structure, and comfortable in use--also, incidentally, beautiful.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This room was occupied by a number of women, eighteen to be exact, some of whom we distinctly recalled.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry heaved a disappointed sigh.  &quot;The Colonels!&quot; I heard him whisper to Jeff.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff, however, advanced and bowed in his best manner; so did we all, and we were saluted civilly by the tall-standing women.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had no need to make pathetic pantomime of hunger; the smaller tables were already laid with food, and we were gravely invited to be seated.  The tables were set for two; each of us found ourselves placed vis-a-vis with one of our hosts, and each table had five other stalwarts nearby, unobtrusively watching.  We had plenty of time to get tired of those women!</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The breakfast was not profuse, but sufficient in amount and excellent in quality.  We were all too good travelers to object to novelty, and this repast with its new but delicious fruit, its dish of large rich-flavored nuts, and its highly satisfactory little cakes was most agreeable.  There was water to drink, and a hot beverage of a most pleasing quality, some preparation like cocoa.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And then and there, willy-nilly, before we had satisfied our appetites, our education began.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> By each of our plates lay a little book, a real printed book, though different from ours both in paper and binding, as well, of course, as in type.  We examined them curiously.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Shades of Sauveur!&quot; muttered Terry.  &quot;We&#x27;re to learn the language!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We were indeed to learn the language, and not only that, but to teach our own.  There were blank books with parallel columns, neatly ruled, evidently prepared for the occasion, and in these, as fast as we learned and wrote down the name of anything, we were urged to write our own name for it by its side.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The book we had to study was evidently a schoolbook, one in which children learned to read, and we judged from this, and from their frequent consultation as to methods, that they had had no previous experience in the art of teaching foreigners their language, or of learning any other.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> On the other hand, what they lacked in experience, they made up for in genius.  Such subtle understanding, such instant recognition of our difficulties, and readiness to meet them, were a constant surprise to us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course, we were willing to meet them halfway.  It was wholly to our advantage to be able to understand and speak with them, and as to refusing to teach them--why should we?  Later on we did try open rebellion, but only once.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> That first meal was pleasant enough, each of us quietly studying his companion, Jeff with sincere admiration, Terry with that highly technical look of his, as of a past master--like a lion tamer, a serpent charmer, or some such professional.  I myself was intensely interested.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was evident that those sets of five were there to check any outbreak on our part.  We had no weapons, and if we did try to do any damage, with a chair, say, why five to one was too many for us, even if they were women; that we had found out to our sorrow.  It was not pleasant, having them always around, but we soon got used to it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It&#x27;s better than being physically restrained ourselves,&quot; Jeff philosophically suggested when we were alone.  &quot;They&#x27;ve given us a room--with no great possibility of escape--and personal liberty--heavily chaperoned.  It&#x27;s better than we&#x27;d have been likely to get in a man-country.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Man-Country!  Do you really believe there are no men here, you innocent?  Don&#x27;t you know there must be?&quot; demanded Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Ye--es,&quot; Jeff agreed.  &quot;Of course--and yet--&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;And yet--what!  Come, you obdurate sentimentalist--what are you thinking about?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They may have some peculiar division of labor we&#x27;ve never heard of,&quot; I suggested.  &quot;The men may live in separate towns, or they may have subdued them--somehow--and keep them shut up. But there must be some.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That last suggestion of yours is a nice one, Van,&quot; Terry protested.  &quot;Same as they&#x27;ve got us subdued and shut up! you make me shiver.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Well, figure it out for yourself, anyway you please.  We saw plenty of kids, the first day, and we&#x27;ve seen those girls--&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Real girls!&quot; Terry agreed, in immense relief.  &quot;Glad you mentioned &#x27;em.  I declare, if I thought there was nothing in the country but those grenadiers I&#x27;d jump out the window.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Speaking of windows,&quot; I suggested, &quot;let&#x27;s examine ours.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We looked out of all the windows.  The blinds opened easily enough, and there were no bars, but the prospect was not reassuring.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This was not the pink-walled town we had so rashly entered the day before.  Our chamber was high up, in a projecting wing of a sort of castle, built out on a steep spur of rock.  Immediately below us were gardens, fruitful and fragrant, but their high walls followed the edge of the cliff which dropped sheer down, we could not see how far. The distant sound of water suggested a river at the foot.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We could look out east, west, and south.  To the southeastward stretched the open country, lying bright and fair in the morning light, but on either side, and evidently behind, rose great mountains.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;This thing is a regular fortress--and no women built it, I can tell you that,&quot; said Terry.  We nodded agreeingly.  &quot;It&#x27;s right up among the hills--they must have brought us a long way.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We saw some kind of swift-moving vehicles the first day,&quot; Jeff reminded us.  &quot;If they&#x27;ve got motors, they ARE civilized.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Civilized or not, we&#x27;ve got our work cut out for us to get away from here.  I don&#x27;t propose to make a rope of bedclothes and try those walls till I&#x27;m sure there is no better way.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We all concurred on this point, and returned to our discussion as to the women.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff continued thoughtful.  &quot;All the same, there&#x27;s something funny about it,&quot; he urged.  &quot;It isn&#x27;t just that we don&#x27;t see any men --but we don&#x27;t see any signs of them.  The--the--reaction of these women is different from any that I&#x27;ve ever met.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;There is something in what you say, Jeff,&quot; I agreed.  &quot;There is a different--atmosphere.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They don&#x27;t seem to notice our being men,&quot; he went on. &quot;They treat us--well--just as they do one another.  It&#x27;s as if our being men was a minor incident.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I nodded.  I&#x27;d noticed it myself.  But Terry broke in rudely.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Fiddlesticks!&quot; he said.  &quot;It&#x27;s because of their advanced age. They&#x27;re all grandmas, I tell you--or ought to be.  Great aunts, anyhow.  Those girls were girls all right, weren&#x27;t they?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Yes--&quot; Jeff agreed, still slowly.  &quot;But they weren&#x27;t afraid-- they flew up that tree and hid, like schoolboys caught out of bounds-- not like shy girls.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;And they ran like marathon winners--you&#x27;ll admit that, Terry,&quot; he added.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was moody as the days passed.  He seemed to mind our confinement more than Jeff or I did; and he harped on Alima, and how near he&#x27;d come to catching her.  &quot;If I had--&quot; he would say, rather savagely, &quot;we&#x27;d have had a hostage and could have made terms.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But Jeff was getting on excellent terms with his tutor, and even his guards, and so was I.  It interested me profoundly to note and study the subtle difference between these women and other women, and try to account for them.  In the matter of personal appearance, there was a great difference.  They all wore short hair, some few inches at most; some curly, some not; all light and clean and fresh-looking.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;If their hair was only long,&quot; Jeff would complain, &quot;they would look so much more feminine.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I rather liked it myself, after I got used to it.  Why we should so admire &quot;a woman&#x27;s crown of hair&quot; and not admire a Chinaman&#x27;s queue is hard to explain, except that we are so convinced that the long hair &quot;belongs&quot; to a woman.  Whereas the &quot;mane&quot; in horses is on both, and in lions, buffalos, and such creatures only on the male. But I did miss it--at first.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Our time was quite pleasantly filled.  We were free of the garden below our windows, quite long in its irregular rambling shape, bordering the cliff.  The walls were perfectly smooth and high, ending in the masonry of the building; and as I studied the great stones I became convinced that the whole structure was extremely old.  It was built like the pre-Incan architecture in Peru, of enormous monoliths, fitted as closely as mosaics.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;These folks have a history, that&#x27;s sure,&quot; I told the others. &quot;And SOME time they were fighters--else why a fortress?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I said we were free of the garden, but not wholly alone in it. There was always a string of those uncomfortably strong women sitting about, always one of them watching us even if the others were reading, playing games, or busy at some kind of handiwork.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;When I see them knit,&quot; Terry said, &quot;I can almost call them feminine.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That doesn&#x27;t prove anything,&quot; Jeff promptly replied. &quot;Scotch shepherds knit--always knitting.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;When we get out--&quot; Terry stretched himself and looked at the far peaks, &quot;when we get out of this and get to where the real women are--the mothers, and the girls--&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Well, what&#x27;ll we do then?&quot; I asked, rather gloomily.  &quot;How do you know we&#x27;ll ever get out?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This was an unpleasant idea, which we unanimously considered, returning with earnestness to our studies.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;If we are good boys and learn our lessons well,&quot; I suggested. &quot;If we are quiet and respectful and polite and they are not afraid of us--then perhaps they will let us out.  And anyway--when we do escape, it is of immense importance that we know the language.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Personally, I was tremendously interested in that language, and seeing they had books, was eager to get at them, to dig into their history, if they had one.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was not hard to speak, smooth and pleasant to the ear, and so easy to read and write that I marveled at it.  They had an absolutely phonetic system, the whole thing was as scientific as Esparanto yet bore all the marks of an old and rich civilization.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We were free to study as much as we wished, and were not left merely to wander in the garden for recreation but introduced to a great gymnasium, partly on the roof and partly in the story below.  Here we learned real respect for our tall guards.  No change of costume was needed for this work, save to lay off outer clothing.  The first one was as perfect a garment for exercise as need be devised, absolutely free to move in, and, I had to admit, much better-looking than our usual one.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Forty--over forty--some of &#x27;em fifty, I bet--and look at &#x27;em!&quot; grumbled Terry in reluctant admiration.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There were no spectacular acrobatics, such as only the young can perform, but for all-around development they had a most excellent system.  A good deal of music went with it, with posture dancing and, sometimes, gravely beautiful processional performances.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff was much impressed by it.  We did not know then how small a part of their physical culture methods this really was, but found it agreeable to watch, and to take part in.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Oh yes, we took part all right!  It wasn&#x27;t absolutely compulsory, but we thought it better to please.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was the strongest of us, though I was wiry and had good staying power, and Jeff was a great sprinter and hurdler, but I can tell you those old ladies gave us cards and spades. They ran like deer, by which I mean that they ran not as if it was a performance, but as if it was their natural gait. We remembered those fleeting girls of our first bright adventure, and concluded that it was.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They leaped like deer, too, with a quick folding motion of the legs, drawn up and turned to one side with a sidelong twist of the body.  I remembered the sprawling spread-eagle way in which some of the fellows used to come over the line--and tried to learn the trick.  We did not easily catch up with these experts, however.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Never thought I&#x27;d live to be bossed by a lot of elderly lady acrobats,&quot; Terry protested.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had games, too, a good many of them, but we found them rather uninteresting at first.  It was like two people playing solitaire to see who would get it first; more like a race or a--a competitive examination, than a real game with some fight in it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I philosophized a bit over this and told Terry it argued against their having any men about.  &quot;There isn&#x27;t a man-size game in the lot,&quot; I said.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;But they are interesting--I like them,&quot; Jeff objected, &quot;and I&#x27;m sure they are educational.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I&#x27;m sick and tired of being educated,&quot; Terry protested. &quot;Fancy going to a dame school--at our age.  I want to Get Out!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly.  Our special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem.  They seemed of rather finer quality than the guards, though all were on terms of easy friendliness.  Mine was named Somel, Jeff&#x27;s Zava, and Terry&#x27;s Moadine.  We tried to generalize from the names, those of the guards, and of our three girls, but got nowhere.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They sound well enough, and they&#x27;re mostly short, but there&#x27;s no similarity of termination--and no two alike. However, our acquaintance is limited as yet.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There were many things we meant to ask--as soon as we could talk well enough.  Better teaching I never saw.  From morning to night there was Somel, always on call except between two and four; always pleasant with a steady friendly kindness that I grew to enjoy very much.  Jeff said Miss Zava--he would put on a title, though they apparently had none--was a darling, that she reminded him of his Aunt Esther at home; but Terry refused to be won, and rather jeered at his own companion, when we were alone.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I&#x27;m sick of it!&quot; he protested.  &quot;Sick of the whole thing.  Here we are cooped up as helpless as a bunch of three-year-old orphans, and being taught what they think is necessary--whether we like it or not.  Confound their old-maid impudence!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Nevertheless we were taught.  They brought in a raised map of their country, beautifully made, and increased our knowledge of geographical terms; but when we inquired for information as to the country outside, they smilingly shook their heads.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They brought pictures, not only the engravings in the books but colored studies of plants and trees and flowers and birds. They brought tools and various small objects--we had plenty of &quot;material&quot; in our school.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> If it had not been for Terry we would have been much more contented, but as the weeks ran into months he grew more and more irritable.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Don&#x27;t act like a bear with a sore head,&quot; I begged him. &quot;We&#x27;re getting on finely.  Every day we can understand them better, and pretty soon we can make a reasonable plea to be let out--&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;LET out!&quot; he stormed.  &quot;LET out--like children kept after school.  I want to Get Out, and I&#x27;m going to.  I want to find the men of this place and fight!--or the girls--&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Guess it&#x27;s the girls you&#x27;re most interested in,&quot; Jeff commented. &quot;What are you going to fight WITH--your fists?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Yes--or sticks and stones--I&#x27;d just like to!&quot;  And Terry squared off and tapped Jeff softly on the jaw.  &quot;Just for instance,&quot; he said.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Anyhow,&quot; he went on, &quot;we could get back to our machine and clear out.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;If it&#x27;s there,&quot; I cautiously suggested.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t croak, Van!  If it isn&#x27;t there, we&#x27;ll find our way down somehow--the boat&#x27;s there, I guess.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was hard on Terry, so hard that he finally persuaded us to consider a plan of escape.  It was difficult, it was highly dangerous, but he declared that he&#x27;d go alone if we wouldn&#x27;t go with him, and of course we couldn&#x27;t think of that.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It appeared he had made a pretty careful study of the environment. From our end window that faced the point of the promontory we could get a fair idea of the stretch of wall, and the drop below.  Also from the roof we could make out more, and even, in one place, glimpse a sort of path below the wall.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It&#x27;s a question of three things,&quot; he said.  &quot;Ropes, agility, and not being seen.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That&#x27;s the hardest part,&quot; I urged, still hoping to dissuade him. &quot;One or another pair of eyes is on us every minute except at night.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Therefore we must do it at night,&quot; he answered.  &quot;That&#x27;s easy.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We&#x27;ve got to think that if they catch us we may not be so well treated afterward,&quot; said Jeff.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That&#x27;s the business risk we must take.  I&#x27;m going--if I break my neck.&quot;  There was no changing him.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The rope problem was not easy.  Something strong enough to hold a man and long enough to let us down into the garden, and then down over the wall.  There were plenty of strong ropes in the gymnasium--they seemed to love to swing and climb on them--but we were never there by ourselves.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We should have to piece it out from our bedding, rugs, and garments, and moreover, we should have to do it after we were shut in for the night, for every day the place was cleaned to perfection by two of our guardians.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had no shears, no knives, but Terry was resourceful. &quot;These Jennies have glass and china, you see.  We&#x27;ll break a glass from the bathroom and use that.  `Love will find out a way,&#x27;&quot; he hummed.  &quot;When we&#x27;re all out of the window, we&#x27;ll stand three-man high and cut the rope as far up as we can reach, so as to have more for the wall.  I know just where I saw that bit of path below, and there&#x27;s a big tree there, too, or a vine or something--I saw the leaves.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It seemed a crazy risk to take, but this was, in a way, Terry&#x27;s expedition, and we were all tired of our imprisonment.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we waited for full moon, retired early, and spent an anxious hour or two in the unskilled manufacture of man-strong ropes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> To retire into the depths of the closet, muffle a glass in thick cloth, and break it without noise was not difficult, and broken glass will cut, though not as deftly as a pair of scissors.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The broad moonlight streamed in through four of our windows--we had not dared leave our lights on too long--and we worked hard and fast at our task of destruction.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Hangings, rugs, robes, towels, as well as bed-furniture--even the mattress covers--we left not one stitch upon another, as Jeff put it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then at an end window, as less liable to observation, we fastened one end of our cable, strongly, to the firm-set hinge of the inner blind, and dropped our coiled bundle of rope softly over.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;This part&#x27;s easy enough--I&#x27;ll come last, so as to cut the rope,&quot; said Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So I slipped down first, and stood, well braced against the wall; then Jeff on my shoulders, then Terry, who shook us a little as he sawed through the cord above his head.  Then I slowly dropped to the ground, Jeff following, and at last we all three stood safe in the garden, with most of our rope with us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Good-bye, Grandma!&quot; whispered Terry, under his breath, and we crept softly toward the wall, taking advantage of the shadow of every bush and tree.  He had been foresighted enough to mark the very spot, only a scratch of stone on stone, but we could see to read in that light.  For anchorage there was a tough, fair-sized shrub close to the wall.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Now I&#x27;ll climb up on you two again and go over first,&quot; said Terry.  &quot;That&#x27;ll hold the rope firm till you both get up on top. Then I&#x27;ll go down to the end.  If I can get off safely, you can see me and follow--or, say, I&#x27;ll twitch it three times.  If I find there&#x27;s absolutely no footing--why I&#x27;ll climb up again, that&#x27;s all.  I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll kill us.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> From the top he reconnoitered carefully, waved his hand, and whispered, &quot;OK,&quot; then slipped over.  Jeff climbed up and I followed, and we rather shivered to see how far down that swaying, wavering figure dropped, hand under hand, till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then there were three quick pulls, and Jeff and I, not without a joyous sense of recovered freedom, successfully followed our leader.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                        CHAPTER 4</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                       Our Venture</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We were standing on a narrow, irregular, all too slanting little ledge, and should doubtless have ignominiously slipped off and broken our rash necks but for the vine.  This was a thick-leaved, wide-spreading thing, a little like Amphelopsis.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It&#x27;s not QUITE vertical here, you see,&quot; said Terry, full of pride and enthusiasm.  &quot;This thing never would hold our direct weight, but I think if we sort of slide down on it, one at a time, sticking in with hands and feet, we&#x27;ll reach that next ledge alive.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;As we do not wish to get up our rope again--and can&#x27;t comfortably stay here--I approve,&quot; said Jeff solemnly.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry slid down first--said he&#x27;d show us how a Christian meets his death.  Luck was with us.  We had put on the thickest of those intermediate suits, leaving our tunics behind, and made this scramble quite successfully, though I got a pretty heavy fall just at the end, and was only kept on the second ledge by main force.  The next stage was down a sort of &quot;chimney&quot;--a long irregular fissure; and so with scratches many and painful and bruises not a few, we finally reached the stream.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was darker there, but we felt it highly necessary to put as much distance as possible behind us; so we waded, jumped, and clambered down that rocky riverbed, in the flickering black and white moonlight and leaf shadow, till growing daylight forced a halt.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We found a friendly nut-tree, those large, satisfying, soft- shelled nuts we already knew so well, and filled our pockets.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I see that I have not remarked that these women had pockets in surprising number and variety.  They were in all their garments, and the middle one in particular was shingled with them.  So we stocked up with nuts till we bulged like Prussian privates in marching order, drank all we could hold, and retired for the day.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was not a very comfortable place, not at all easy to get at, just a sort of crevice high up along the steep bank, but it was well veiled with foliage and dry.  After our exhaustive three- or four- hour scramble and the good breakfast food, we all lay down along that crack--heads and tails, as it were--and slept till the afternoon sun almost toasted our faces.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry poked a tentative foot against my head.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;How are you, Van?

But I&#x27;d run away in the Antarctic ice fields rather than be a prisoner.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We soon dozed off again.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The long rest and penetrating dry heat were good for us, and that night we covered a considerable distance, keeping always in the rough forested belt of land which we knew bordered the whole country.  Sometimes we were near the outer edge, and caught sudden glimpses of the tremendous depths beyond.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;This piece of geography stands up like a basalt column,&quot; Jeff said.  &quot;Nice time we&#x27;ll have getting down if they have confiscated our machine!&quot;  For which suggestion he received summary chastisement.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> What we could see inland was peaceable enough, but only moonlit glimpses; by daylight we lay very close.  As Terry said, we did not wish to kill the old ladies--even if we could; and short of that they were perfectly competent to pick us up bodily and carry us back, if discovered.  There was nothing for it but to lie low, and sneak out unseen if we could do it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There wasn&#x27;t much talking done.  At night we had our marathon-obstacle race; we &quot;stayed not for brake and we stopped not for stone,&quot; and swam whatever water was too deep to wade and could not be got around; but that was only necessary twice.  By day, sleep, sound and sweet.  Mighty lucky it was that we could live off the country as we did.  Even that margin of forest seemed rich in foodstuffs.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But Jeff thoughtfully suggested that that very thing showed how careful we should have to be, as we might run into some stalwart group of gardeners or foresters or nut-gatherers at any minute. Careful we were, feeling pretty sure that if we did not make good this time we were not likely to have another opportunity; and at last we reached a point from which we could see, far below, the broad stretch of that still lake from which we had made our ascent.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That looks pretty good to me!&quot; said Terry, gazing down at it. &quot;Now, if we can&#x27;t find the &#x27;plane, we know where to aim if we have to drop over this wall some other way.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The wall at that point was singularly uninviting.  It rose so straight that we had to put our heads over to see the base, and the country below seemed to be a far-off marshy tangle of rank vegetation.  We did not have to risk our necks to that extent, however, for at last, stealing along among the rocks and trees like so many creeping savages, we came to that flat space where we had landed; and there, in unbelievable good fortune, we found our machine.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Covered, too, by jingo!  Would you think they had that much sense?&quot; cried Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;If they had that much, they&#x27;re likely to have more,&quot; I warned him, softly.  &quot;Bet you the thing&#x27;s watched.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We reconnoitered as widely as we could in the failing moonlight-- moons are of a painfully unreliable nature; but the growing dawn showed us the familiar shape, shrouded in some heavy cloth like canvas, and no slightest sign of any watchman near. We decided to make a quick dash as soon as the light was strong enough for accurate work.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I don&#x27;t care if the old thing&#x27;ll go or not,&quot; Terry declared. &quot;We can run her to the edge, get aboard, and just plane down--plop! --beside our boat there.  Look there--see the boat!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Sure enough--there was our motor, lying like a gray cocoon on the flat pale sheet of water.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Quietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings of that cover.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Confound the thing!&quot; Terry cried in desperate impatience. &quot;They&#x27;ve got it sewed up in a bag!  And we&#x27;ve not a knife among us!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then, as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that made Terry lift his head like a war horse--the sound of an unmistakable giggle, yes--three giggles.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There they were--Celis, Alima, Ellador--looking just as they had when we first saw them, standing a little way off from us, as interested, as mischievous as three schoolboys.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Hold on, Terry--hold on!&quot; I warned.  &quot;That&#x27;s too easy.  Look out for a trap.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Let us appeal to their kind hearts,&quot; Jeff urged.  &quot;I think they will help us.  Perhaps they&#x27;ve got knives.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It&#x27;s no use rushing them, anyhow,&quot; I was absolutely holding on to Terry.  &quot;We know they can out-run and out-climb us.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He reluctantly admitted this; and after a brief parley among ourselves, we all advanced slowly toward them, holding out our hands in token of friendliness.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They stood their ground till we had come fairly near, and then indicated that we should stop.  To make sure, we advanced a step or two and they promptly and swiftly withdrew.  So we stopped at the distance specified.  Then we used their language, as far as we were able, to explain our plight, telling how we were imprisoned, how we had escaped--a good deal of pantomime here and vivid interest on their part--how we had traveled by night and hidden by day, living on nuts--and here Terry pretended great hunger.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I know he could not have been hungry; we had found plenty to eat and had not been sparing in helping ourselves.  But they seemed somewhat impressed; and after a murmured consultation they produced from their pockets certain little packages, and with the utmost ease and accuracy tossed them into our hands.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff was most appreciative of this; and Terry made extravagant gestures of admiration, which seemed to set them off, boy- fashion, to show their skill.  While we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us, and while Ellador kept a watchful eye on our movements, Celis ran off to some distance, and set up a sort of &quot;duck-on-a-rock&quot; arrangement, a big yellow nut on top of three balanced sticks; Alima, meanwhile, gathering stones.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They urged us to throw at it, and we did, but the thing was a long way off, and it was only after a number of failures, at which those elvish damsels laughed delightedly, that Jeff succeeded in bringing the whole structure to the ground.  It took me still longer, and Terry, to his intense annoyance, came third.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then Celis set up the little tripod again, and looked back at us, knocking it down, pointing at it, and shaking her short curls severely.  &quot;No,&quot; she said.  &quot;Bad--wrong!&quot;  We were quite able to follow her.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then she set it up once more, put the fat nut on top, and returned to the others; and there those aggravating girls sat and took turns throwing little stones at that thing, while one stayed by as a setter-up; and they just popped that nut off, two times out of three, without upsetting the sticks.  Pleased as Punch they were, too, and we pretended to be, but weren&#x27;t.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We got very friendly over this game, but I told Terry we&#x27;d be sorry if we didn&#x27;t get off while we could, and then we begged for knives. It was easy to show what we wanted to do, and they each proudly produced a sort of strong clasp-knife from their pockets.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Yes,&quot; we said eagerly, &quot;that&#x27;s it!  Please--&quot;  We had learned quite a bit of their language, you see.  And we just begged for those knives, but they would not give them to us.  If we came a step too near they backed off, standing light and eager for flight.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It&#x27;s no sort of use,&quot; I said.  &quot;Come on--let&#x27;s get a sharp stone or something--we must get this thing off.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we hunted about and found what edged fragments we could, and hacked away, but it was like trying to cut sailcloth with a clamshell.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry hacked and dug, but said to us under his breath.  &quot;Boys, we&#x27;re in pretty good condition--let&#x27;s make a life and death dash and get hold of those girls--we&#x27;ve got to.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had drawn rather nearer to watch our efforts, and we did take them rather by surprise; also, as Terry said, our recent training had strengthened us in wind and limb, and for a few desperate moments those girls were scared and we almost triumphant.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But just as we stretched out our hands, the distance between us widened; they had got their pace apparently, and then, though we ran at our utmost speed, and much farther than I thought wise, they kept just out of reach all the time.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We stopped breathless, at last, at my repeated admonitions.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;This is stark foolishness,&quot; I urged.  &quot;They are doing it on purpose--come back or you&#x27;ll be sorry.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We went back, much slower than we came, and in truth we were sorry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As we reached our swaddled machine, and sought again to tear loose its covering, there rose up from all around the sturdy forms, the quiet determined faces we knew so well.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Oh Lord!&quot; groaned Terry.  &quot;The Colonels!  It&#x27;s all up--they&#x27;re forty to one.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was no use to fight.  These women evidently relied on numbers, not so much as a drilled force but as a multitude actuated by a common impulse.  They showed no sign of fear, and since we had no weapons whatever and there were at least a hundred of them, standing ten deep about us, we gave in as gracefully as we might.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course we looked for punishment--a closer imprisonment, solitary confinement maybe--but nothing of the kind happened. They treated us as truants only, and as if they quite understood our truancy.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Back we went, not under an anesthetic this time but skimming along in electric motors enough like ours to be quite recognizable, each of us in a separate vehicle with one able-bodied lady on either side and three facing him.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They were all pleasant enough, and talked to us as much as was possible with our limited powers.  And though Terry was keenly mortified, and at first we all rather dreaded harsh treatment, I for one soon began to feel a sort of pleasant confidence and to enjoy the trip.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here were my five familiar companions, all good-natured as could be, seeming to have no worse feeling than a mild triumph as of winning some simple game; and even that they politely suppressed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This was a good opportunity to see the country, too, and the more I saw of it, the better I liked it.  We went too swiftly for close observation, but I could appreciate perfect roads, as dustless as a swept floor; the shade of endless lines of trees; the ribbon of flowers that unrolled beneath them; and the rich comfortable country that stretched off and away, full of varied charm.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We rolled through many villages and towns, and I soon saw that the parklike beauty of our first-seen city was no exception. Our swift high-sweeping view from the &#x27;plane had been most attractive, but lacked detail; and in that first day of struggle and capture, we noticed little.  But now we were swept along at an easy rate of some thirty miles an hour and covered quite a good deal of ground.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We stopped for lunch in quite a sizable town, and here, rolling slowly through the streets, we saw more of the population. They had come out to look at us everywhere we had passed, but here were more; and when we went in to eat, in a big garden place with little shaded tables among the trees and flowers, many eyes were upon us.  And everywhere, open country, village, or city-- only women.  Old women and young women and a great majority who seemed neither young nor old, but just women; young girls, also, though these, and the children, seeming to be in groups by themselves generally, were less in evidence.  We caught many glimpses of girls and children in what seemed to be schools or in playgrounds, and so far as we could judge there were no boys.  We all looked, carefully.  Everyone gazed at us politely, kindly, and with eager interest. No one was impertinent.  We could catch quite a bit of the talk now, and all they said seemed pleasant enough.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Well--before nightfall we were all safely back in our big room. The damage we had done was quite ignored; the beds as smooth and comfortable as before, new clothing and towels supplied.  The only thing those women did was to illuminate the gardens at night, and to set an extra watch.  But they called us to account next day. Our three tutors, who had not joined in the recapturing expedition, had been quite busy in preparing for us, and now made explanation.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They knew well we would make for our machine, and also that there was no other way of getting down--alive.  So our flight had troubled no one; all they did was to call the inhabitants to keep an eye on our movements all along the edge of the forest between the two points.  It appeared that many of those nights we had been seen, by careful ladies sitting snugly in big trees by the riverbed, or up among the rocks.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry looked immensely disgusted, but it struck me as extremely funny.  Here we had been risking our lives, hiding and prowling like outlaws, living on nuts and fruit, getting wet and cold at night, and dry and hot by day, and all the while these estimable women had just been waiting for us to come out.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Now they began to explain, carefully using such words as we could understand.  It appeared that we were considered as guests of the country--sort of public wards.  Our first violence had made it necessary to keep us safeguarded for a while, but as soon as we learned the language--and would agree to do no harm--they would show us all about the land.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff was eager to reassure them.  Of course he did not tell on Terry, but he made it clear that he was ashamed of himself, and that he would now conform.  As to the language--we all fell upon it with redoubled energy.  They brought us books, in greater numbers, and I began to study them seriously.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Pretty punk literature,&quot; Terry burst forth one day, when we were in the privacy of our own room.  &quot;Of course one expects to begin on child-stories, but I would like something more interesting now.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Can&#x27;t expect stirring romance and wild adventure without men, can you?&quot; I asked.  Nothing irritated Terry more than to have us assume that there were no men; but there were no signs of them in the books they gave us, or the pictures.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Shut up!&quot; he growled.  &quot;What infernal nonsense you talk!

By the most prolonged and careful selection and exclusion they had developed a race of cats that did not sing! That&#x27;s a fact.  The most those poor dumb brutes could do was to make a kind of squeak when they were hungry or wanted the door open, and, of course, to purr, and make the various mother-noises to their kittens.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Moreover, they had ceased to kill birds.

We were a good deal impressed by this achievement in breeding, and when they questioned us--I can tell you we were well pumped for information--we told of what had been done for dogs and horses and cattle, but that there was no effort applied to cats, except for show purposes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I wish I could represent the kind, quiet, steady, ingenious way they questioned us.  It was not just curiosity--they weren&#x27;t a bit more curious about us than we were about them, if as much.  But they were bent on understanding our kind of civilization, and their lines of interrogation would gradually surround us and drive us in till we found ourselves up against some admissions we did not want to make.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Are all these breeds of dogs you have made useful?&quot; they asked.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Oh--useful!  Why, the hunting dogs and watchdogs and sheepdogs are useful--and sleddogs of course!--and ratters, I suppose, but we don&#x27;t keep dogs for their USEFULNESS.

I&#x27;d never seen such cats, except in a few rare instances.  Big, handsome silky things, friendly with everyone and devotedly attached to their special owners.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You must have a heartbreaking time drowning kittens,&quot; we suggested.  But they said, &quot;Oh, no!  You see we care for them as you do for your valuable cattle.  The fathers are few compared to the mothers, just a few very fine ones in each town; they live quite happily in walled gardens and the houses of their friends. But they only have a mating season once a year.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Rather hard on Thomas, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; suggested Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Oh, no--truly!  You see, it is many centuries that we have been breeding the kind of cats we wanted.  They are healthy and happy and friendly, as you see.  How do you manage with your dogs? Do you keep them in pairs, or segregate the fathers, or what?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then we explained that--well, that it wasn&#x27;t a question of fathers exactly; that nobody wanted a--a mother dog; that, well, that practically all our dogs were males--there was only a very small percentage of females allowed to live.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then Zava, observing Terry with her grave sweet smile, quoted back at him: &quot;Rather hard on Thomas, isn&#x27;t it?

Are your dogs as uniformly healthy and sweet-tempered as our cats?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff laughed, eyeing Terry mischievously.  As a matter of fact we began to feel Jeff something of a traitor--he so often flopped over and took their side of things; also his medical knowledge gave him a different point of view somehow.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I&#x27;m sorry to admit,&quot; he told them, &quot;that the dog, with us, is the most diseased of any animal--next to man.

You see, children were the--the RAISON D&#x27;ETRE in this country.  All our interlocutors sat up straight at once.

Besides, they get into fights--a valuable dog might easily be killed by a bigger one.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I see,&quot; she said.  &quot;They fight when they meet--is that common?&quot; We admitted that it was.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They are kept shut up, or chained.&quot;  She paused again, and asked, &quot;Is not a dog fond of running?

I will not try to repeat the careful, detailed account I lost; I&#x27;ll just say that we were kept in that fortress a good six months all told, and after that, three in a pleasant enough city where--to Terry&#x27;s infinite disgust--there were only &quot;Colonels&quot; and little children--no young women whatever.  Then we were under surveillance for three more--always with a tutor or a guard or both.  But those months were pleasant because we were really getting acquainted with the girls.  That was a chapter!-- or will be--I will try to do justice to it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We learned their language pretty thoroughly--had to; and they learned ours much more quickly and used it to hasten our own studies.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff, who was never without reading matter of some sort, had two little books with him, a novel and a little anthology of verse; and I had one of those pocket encyclopedias--a fat little thing, bursting with facts.  These were used in our education--and theirs. Then as soon as we were up to it, they furnished us with plenty of their own books, and I went in for the history part--I wanted to understand the genesis of this miracle of theirs.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And this is what happened, according to their records.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As to geography--at about the time of the Christian era this land had a free passage to the sea.  I&#x27;m not saying where, for good reasons.  But there was a fairly easy pass through that wall of mountains behind us, and there is no doubt in my mind that these people were of Aryan stock, and were once in contact with the best civilization of the old world.  They were &quot;white,&quot; but somewhat darker than our northern races because of their constant exposure to sun and air.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The country was far larger then, including much land beyond the pass, and a strip of coast.  They had ships, commerce, an army, a king--for at that time they were what they so calmly called us --a bi-sexual race.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> What happened to them first was merely a succession of historic misfortunes such as have befallen other nations often enough.  They were decimated by war, driven up from their coastline till finally the reduced population, with many of the men killed in battle, occupied this hinterland, and defended it for years, in the mountain passes.  Where it was open to any possible attack from below they strengthened the natural defenses so that it became unscalably secure, as we found it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They were a polygamous people, and a slave-holding people, like all of their time; and during the generation or two of this struggle to defend their mountain home they built the fortresses, such as the one we were held in, and other of their oldest buildings, some still in use.  Nothing but earthquakes could destroy such architecture--huge solid blocks, holding by their own weight. They must have had efficient workmen and enough of them in those days.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They made a brave fight for their existence, but no nation can stand up against what the steamship companies call &quot;an act of God.&quot;  While the whole fighting force was doing its best to defend their mountain pathway, there occurred a volcanic outburst, with some local tremors, and the result was the complete filling up of the pass--their only outlet.  Instead of a passage, a new ridge, sheer and high, stood between them and the sea; they were walled in, and beneath that wall lay their whole little army. Very few men were left alive, save the slaves; and these now seized their opportunity, rose in revolt, killed their remaining masters even to the youngest boy, killed the old women too, and the mothers, intending to take possession of the country with the remaining young women and girls.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But this succession of misfortunes was too much for those infuriated virgins.  There were many of them, and but few of these would-be masters, so the young women, instead of submitting, rose in sheer desperation and slew their brutal conquerors.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This sounds like Titus Andronicus, I know, but that is their account.  I suppose they were about crazy--can you blame them?</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There was literally no one left on this beautiful high garden land but a bunch of hysterical girls and some older slave women.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> That was about two thousand years ago.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> At first there was a period of sheer despair.  The mountains towered between them and their old enemies, but also between them and escape.  There was no way up or down or out--they simply had to stay there.  Some were for suicide, but not the majority.  They must have been a plucky lot, as a whole, and they decided to live--as long as they did live.  Of course they had hope, as youth must, that something would happen to change their fate.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So they set to work, to bury the dead, to plow and sow, to care for one another.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Speaking of burying the dead, I will set down while I think of it, that they had adopted cremation in about the thirteenth century, for the same reason that they had left off raising cattle --they could not spare the room.  They were much surprised to learn that we were still burying--asked our reasons for it, and were much dissatisfied with what we gave.  We told them of the belief in the resurrection of the body, and they asked if our God was not as well able to resurrect from ashes as from long corruption. We told them of how people thought it repugnant to have their loved ones burn, and they asked if it was less repugnant to have them decay. They were inconveniently reasonable, those women.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Well--that original bunch of girls set to work to clean up the place and make their living as best they could.  Some of the remaining slave women rendered invaluable service, teaching such trades as they knew.  They had such records as were then kept, all the tools and implements of the time, and a most fertile land to work in.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There were a handful of the younger matrons who had escaped slaughter, and a few babies were born after the cataclysm --but only two boys, and they both died.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> For five or ten years they worked together, growing stronger and wiser and more and more mutually attached, and then the miracle happened--one of these young women bore a child.  Of course they all thought there must be a man somewhere, but none was found.  Then they decided it must be a direct gift from the gods, and placed the proud mother in the Temple of Maaia --their Goddess of Motherhood--under strict watch.  And there, as years passed, this wonder-woman bore child after child, five of them--all girls.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I did my best, keenly interested as I have always been in sociology and social psychology, to reconstruct in my mind the real position of these ancient women.  There were some five or six hundred of them, and they were harem-bred; yet for the few preceding generations they had been reared in the atmosphere of such heroic struggle that the stock must have been toughened somewhat.  Left alone in that terrific orphanhood, they had clung together, supporting one another and their little sisters, and developing unknown powers in the stress of new necessity.  To this pain-hardened and work-strengthened group, who had lost not only the love and care of parents, but the hope of ever having children of their own, there now dawned the new hope.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here at last was Motherhood, and though it was not for all of them personally, it might--if the power was inherited--found here a new race.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It may be imagined how those five Daughters of Maaia, Children of the Temple, Mothers of the Future--they had all the titles that love and hope and reverence could give--were reared. The whole little nation of women surrounded them with loving service, and waited, between a boundless hope and an equally boundless despair, to see if they, too, would be mothers.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And they were!  As fast as they reached the age of twenty-five they began bearing.  Each of them, like her mother, bore five daughters.  Presently there were twenty-five New Women, Mothers in their own right, and the whole spirit of the country changed from mourning and mere courageous resignation to proud joy.  The older women, those who remembered men, died off; the youngest of all the first lot of course died too, after a while, and by that time there were left one hundred and fifty-five parthenogenetic women, founding a new race.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They inherited all that the devoted care of that declining band of original ones could leave them.  Their little country was quite safe. Their farms and gardens were all in full production.  Such industries as they had were in careful order.  The records of their past were all preserved, and for years the older women had spent their time in the best teaching they were capable of, that they might leave to the little group of sisters and mothers all they possessed of skill and knowledge.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There you have the start of Herland!  One family, all descended from one mother!  She lived to a hundred years old; lived to see her hundred and twenty-five great-granddaughters born; lived as Queen-Priestess-Mother of them all; and died with a nobler pride and a fuller joy than perhaps any human soul has ever known--she alone had founded a new race!</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The first five daughters had grown up in an atmosphere of holy calm, of awed watchful waiting, of breathless prayer.  To them the longed-for motherhood was not only a personal joy, but a nation&#x27;s hope.  Their twenty-five daughters in turn, with a stronger hope, a richer, wider outlook, with the devoted love and care of all the surviving population, grew up as a holy sisterhood, their whole ardent youth looking forward to their great office. And at last they were left alone; the white-haired First Mother was gone, and this one family, five sisters, twenty-five first cousins, and a hundred and twenty-five second cousins, began a new race.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here you have human beings, unquestionably, but what we were slow in understanding was how these ultra-women, inheriting only from women, had eliminated not only certain masculine characteristics, which of course we did not look for, but so much of what we had always thought essentially feminine.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The tradition of men as guardians and protectors had quite died out.

We all know women can&#x27;t organize--that they scrap like anything-- are frightfully jealous.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;But these New Ladies didn&#x27;t have anyone to be jealous of, remember,&quot; drawled Jeff.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;That&#x27;s a likely story,&quot; Terry sneered.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Why don&#x27;t you invent a likelier one?&quot; I asked him. &quot;Here ARE the women--nothing but women, and you yourself admit there&#x27;s no trace of a man in the country.&quot;  This was after we had been about a good deal.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I&#x27;ll admit that,&quot; he growled.  &quot;And it&#x27;s a big miss, too.  There&#x27;s not only no fun without &#x27;em--no real sport--no competition; but these women aren&#x27;t WOMANLY.  You know they aren&#x27;t.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> That kind of talk always set Jeff going; and I gradually grew to side with him.  &quot;Then you don&#x27;t call a breed of women whose one concern is motherhood--womanly?&quot; he asked.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Indeed I don&#x27;t,&quot; snapped Terry.  &quot;What does a man care for motherhood--when he hasn&#x27;t a ghost of a chance at fatherhood? And besides--what&#x27;s the good of talking sentiment when we are just men together?  What a man wants of women is a good deal more than all this `motherhood&#x27;!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We were as patient as possible with Terry.  He had lived about nine months among the &quot;Colonels&quot; when he made that outburst; and with no chance at any more strenuous excitement than our gymnastics gave us--save for our escape fiasco.  I don&#x27;t suppose Terry had ever lived so long with neither Love, Combat, nor Danger to employ his superabundant energies, and he was irritable. Neither Jeff nor I found it so wearing.  I was so much interested intellectually that our confinement did not wear on me; and as for Jeff, bless his heart!--he enjoyed the society of that tutor of his almost as much as if she had been a girl--I don&#x27;t know but more.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As to Terry&#x27;s criticism, it was true.  These women, whose essential distinction of motherhood was the dominant note of their whole culture, were strikingly deficient in what we call &quot;femininity.&quot;  This led me very promptly to the conviction that those &quot;feminine charms&quot; we are so fond of are not feminine at all, but mere reflected masculinity--developed to please us because they had to please us, and in no way essential to the real fulfillment of their great process.  But Terry came to no such conclusion.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Just you wait till I get out!&quot; he muttered.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then we both cautioned him.  &quot;Look here, Terry, my boy!  You be careful!  They&#x27;ve been mighty good to us--but do you remember the anesthesia?  If you do any mischief in this virgin land, beware of the vengeance of the Maiden Aunts!  Come, be a man!

Then, as they grew more intelligent, this had turned into a sort of Maternal Pantheism.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here was Mother Earth, bearing fruit.  All that they ate was fruit of motherhood, from seed or egg or their product.

First this was merely the hope of bearing better ones, and then they recognized that however the children differed at birth, the real growth lay later--through education.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then things began to hum.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As I learned more and more to appreciate what these women had accomplished, the less proud I was of what we, with all our manhood, had done.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> You see, they had had no wars.

Indeed, we soon found from their earnest questions of us that they were prepared to believe our world must be better than theirs.

As I look back now, knowing them better, I am more and more and more amazed as I appreciate the exquisite courtesy with which they had received over and over again statements and admissions on our part which must have revolted them to the soul.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She explained to me, with sweet seriousness, that as I had supposed, at first each woman bore five children; and that, in their eager desire to build up a nation, they had gone on in that way for a few centuries, till they were confronted with the absolute need of a limit.  This fact was equally plain to all--all were equally interested.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They were now as anxious to check their wonderful power as they had been to develop it; and for some generations gave the matter their most earnest thought and study.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We were living on rations before we worked it out,&quot; she said. &quot;But we did work it out.  You see, before a child comes to one of us there is a period of utter exaltation--the whole being is uplifted and filled with a concentrated desire for that child.  We learned to look forward to that period with the greatest caution.  Often our young women, those to whom motherhood had not yet come, would voluntarily defer it.  When that deep inner demand for a child began to be felt she would deliberately engage in the most active work, physical and mental; and even more important, would solace her longing by the direct care and service of the babies we already had.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She paused.

And precious--!  No sole heir to an empire&#x27;s throne, no solitary millionaire baby, no only child of middle-aged parents, could compare as an idol with these Herland children.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But before I start on that subject I must finish up that little analysis I was trying to make.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They did effectually and permanently limit the population in numbers, so that the country furnished plenty for the fullest, richest life for all of them: plenty of everything, including room, air, solitude even.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And then they set to work to improve that population in quality-- since they were restricted in quantity.

Do you wonder they were nice people?</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Physiology, hygiene, sanitation, physical culture--all that line of work had been perfected long since.  Sickness was almost wholly unknown among them, so much so that a previously high development in what we call the &quot;science of medicine&quot; had become practically a lost art.  They were a clean-bred, vigorous lot, having the best of care, the most perfect living conditions always.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> When it came to psychology--there was no one thing which left us so dumbfounded, so really awed, as the everyday working knowledge--and practice--they had in this line.  As we learned more and more of it, we learned to appreciate the exquisite mastery with which we ourselves, strangers of alien race, of unknown opposite sex, had been understood and provided for from the first.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> With this wide, deep, thorough knowledge, they had met and solved the problems of education in ways some of which I hope to make clear later.  Those nation-loved children of theirs compared with the average in our country as the most perfectly cultivated, richly developed roses compare with--tumbleweeds. Yet they did not SEEM &quot;cultivated&quot; at all--it had all become a natural condition.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And this people, steadily developing in mental capacity, in will power, in social devotion, had been playing with the arts and sciences--as far as they knew them--for a good many centuries now with inevitable success.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Into this quiet lovely land, among these wise, sweet, strong women, we, in our easy assumption of superiority, had suddenly arrived; and now, tamed and trained to a degree they considered safe, we were at last brought out to see the country, to know the people.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                        CHAPTER 7</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">                   Our Growing Modesty</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Being at last considered sufficiently tamed and trained to be trusted with scissors, we barbered ourselves as best we could.  A close-trimmed beard is certainly more comfortable than a full one.  Razors, naturally, they could not supply.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;With so many old women you&#x27;d think there&#x27;d be some razors,&quot; sneered Terry.  Whereat Jeff pointed out that he never before had seen such complete absence of facial hair on women.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Looks to me as if the absence of men made them more feminine in that regard, anyhow,&quot; he suggested.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Well, it&#x27;s the only one then,&quot; Terry reluctantly agreed. &quot;A less feminine lot I never saw.  A child apiece doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough to develop what I call motherliness.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry&#x27;s idea of motherliness was the usual one, involving a baby in arms, or &quot;a little flock about her knees,&quot; and the complete absorption of the mother in said baby or flock.  A motherliness which dominated society, which influenced every art and industry, which absolutely protected all childhood, and gave to it the most perfect care and training, did not seem motherly--to Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had become well used to the clothes.  They were quite as comfortable as our own--in some ways more so--and undeniably better looking.  As to pockets, they left nothing to be desired. That second garment was fairly quilted with pockets.  They were most ingeniously arranged, so as to be convenient to the hand and not inconvenient to the body, and were so placed as at once to strengthen the garment and add decorative lines of stitching.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> In this, as in so many other points we had now to observe, there was shown the action of a practical intelligence, coupled with fine artistic feeling, and, apparently, untrammeled by any injurious influences.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Our first step of comparative freedom was a personally conducted tour of the country.  No pentagonal bodyguard now! Only our special tutors, and we got on famously with them. Jeff said he loved Zava like an aunt--&quot;only jollier than any aunt I ever saw&quot;; Somel and I were as chummy as could be--the best of friends; but it was funny to watch Terry and Moadine.  She was patient with him, and courteous, but it was like the patience and courtesy of some great man, say a skilled, experienced diplomat, with a schoolgirl.  Her grave acquiescence with his most preposterous expression of feeling; her genial laughter, not only with, but, I often felt, at him--though impeccably polite; her innocent questions, which almost invariably led him to say more than he intended--Jeff and I found it all amusing to watch.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He never seemed to recognize that quiet background of superiority. When she dropped an argument he always thought he had silenced her; when she laughed he thought it tribute to his wit.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I hated to admit to myself how much Terry had sunk in my esteem. Jeff felt it too, I am sure; but neither of us admitted it to the other. At home we had measured him with other men, and, though we knew his failings, he was by no means an unusual type.  We knew his virtues too, and they had always seemed more prominent than the faults.  Measured among women--our women at home, I mean--he had always stood high.  He was visibly popular. Even where his habits were known, there was no discrimination against him; in some cases his reputation for what was felicitously termed &quot;gaiety&quot; seemed a special charm.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But here, against the calm wisdom and quiet restrained humor of these women, with only that blessed Jeff and my inconspicuous self to compare with, Terry did stand out rather strong.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As &quot;a man among men,&quot; he didn&#x27;t; as a man among--I shall have to say, &quot;females,&quot; he didn&#x27;t; his intense masculinity seemed only fit complement to their intense femininity.  But here he was all out of drawing.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Moadine was a big woman, with a balanced strength that seldom showed.  Her eye was as quietly watchful as a fencer&#x27;s. She maintained a pleasant relation with her charge, but I doubt if many, even in that country, could have done as well.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He called her &quot;Maud,&quot; amongst ourselves, and said she was &quot;a good old soul, but a little slow&quot;; wherein he was quite wrong. Needless to say, he called Jeff&#x27;s teacher &quot;Java,&quot; and sometimes &quot;Mocha,&quot; or plain &quot;Coffee&quot;; when specially mischievous, &quot;Chicory,&quot; and even &quot;Postum.&quot;  But Somel rather escaped this form of humor, save for a rather forced &quot;Some &#x27;ell.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Don&#x27;t you people have but one name?&quot; he asked one day, after we had been introduced to a whole group of them, all with pleasant, few-syllabled strange names, like the ones we knew.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Moadine told him.  &quot;A good many of us have another, as we get on in life--a descriptive one.  That is the name we earn.  Sometimes even that is changed, or added to, in an unusually rich life.  Such as our present Land Mother--what you call president or king, I believe.  She was called Mera, even as a child; that means `thinker.&#x27;  Later there was added Du--Du-Mera --the wise thinker, and now we all know her as O-du-mera-- great and wise thinker.  You shall meet her.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;No surnames at all then?&quot; pursued Terry, with his somewhat patronizing air.  &quot;No family name?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Why no,&quot; she said.  &quot;Why should we?  We are all descended from a common source--all one `family&#x27; in reality.  You see, our comparatively brief and limited history gives us that advantage at least.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;But does not each mother want her own child to bear her name?&quot; I asked.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;No--why should she?

There are many reasons for doing that.  But as to everyone knowing which child belongs to which mother--why should she?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here, as in so many other instances, we were led to feel the difference between the purely maternal and the paternal attitude of mind.

Not only books and statues, but all kinds of work.  You will find little names on the houses, on the furniture, on the dishes sometimes.  Because otherwise one is likely to forget, and we want to know to whom to be grateful.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You speak as if it were done for the convenience of the consumer--not the pride of the producer,&quot; I suggested.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It&#x27;s both,&quot; said Somel.  &quot;We have pride enough in our work.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Then why not in your children?&quot; urged Jeff.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;But we have!

When they are babies, we do speak of them, at times, as `Essa&#x27;s Lato,&#x27; or `Novine&#x27;s Amel&#x27;; but that is merely descriptive and conversational.  In the records, of course, the child stands in her own line of mothers; but in dealing with it personally it is Lato, or Amel, without dragging in its ancestors.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;But have you names enough to give a new one to each child?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Assuredly we have, for each living generation.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then they asked about our methods, and found first that &quot;we&quot; did so and so, and then that other nations did differently. Upon which they wanted to know which method has been proved best--and we had to admit that so far as we knew there had been no attempt at comparison, each people pursuing its own custom in the fond conviction of superiority, and either despising or quite ignoring the others.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> With these women the most salient quality in all their institutions was reasonableness.  When I dug into the records to follow out any line of development, that was the most astonishing thing--the conscious effort to make it better.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had early observed the value of certain improvements, had easily inferred that there was room for more, and took the greatest pains to develop two kinds of minds--the critic and inventor.  Those who showed an early tendency to observe, to discriminate, to suggest, were given special training for that function; and some of their highest officials spent their time in the most careful study of one or another branch of work, with a view to its further improvement.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> In each generation there was sure to arrive some new mind to detect faults and show need of alterations; and the whole corps of inventors was at hand to apply their special faculty at the point criticized, and offer suggestions.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had learned by this time not to open a discussion on any of their characteristics without first priming ourselves to answer questions about our own methods; so I kept rather quiet on this matter of conscious improvement.

We had begun to notice from that very first walk in the forest, the first partial view from our &#x27;plane. Now we were taken to see this mighty garden, and shown its methods of culture.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The country was about the size of Holland, some ten or twelve thousand square miles.  One could lose a good many Hollands along the forest-smothered flanks of those mighty mountains. They had a population of about three million--not a large one, but quality is something.  Three million is quite enough to allow for considerable variation, and these people varied more widely than we could at first account for.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry had insisted that if they were parthenogenetic they&#x27;d be as alike as so many ants or aphids; he urged their visible differences as proof that there must be men--somewhere.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But when we asked them, in our later, more intimate conversations, how they accounted for so much divergence without cross-fertilization, they attributed it partly to the careful education, which followed each slight tendency to differ, and partly to the law of mutation.  This they had found in their work with plants, and fully proven in their own case.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Physically they were more alike than we, as they lacked all morbid or excessive types.

It may be that all these higher qualities were latent in the original mother, that careful education is bringing them out, and that our personal differences depend on slight variations in prenatal condition.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I think it is more in your accumulated culture,&quot; Jeff suggested. &quot;And in the amazing psychic growth you have made.

Having known in our lives several people who showed the same delicate courtesy and were equally pleasant to live with, at least when they wore their &quot;company manners,&quot; we had assumed that our companions were a carefully chosen few.  Later we were more and more impressed that all this gentle breeding was breeding; that they were born to it, reared in it, that it was as natural and universal with them as the gentleness of doves or the alleged wisdom of serpents.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As for the intelligence, I confess that this was the most impressive and, to me, most mortifying, of any single feature of Herland.  We soon ceased to comment on this or other matters which to them were such obvious commonplaces as to call forth embarrassing questions about our own conditions.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This was nowhere better shown than in that matter of food supply, which I will now attempt to describe.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Having improved their agriculture to the highest point, and carefully estimated the number of persons who could comfortably live on their square miles; having then limited their population to that number, one would think that was all there was to be done. But they had not thought so.  To them the country was a unit--it was theirs.  They themselves were a unit, a conscious group; they thought in terms of the community.  As such, their time-sense was not limited to the hopes and ambitions of an individual life.  Therefore, they habitually considered and carried out plans for improvement which might cover centuries.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I had never seen, had scarcely imagined, human beings undertaking such a work as the deliberate replanting of an entire forest area with different kinds of trees.  Yet this seemed to them the simplest common sense, like a man&#x27;s plowing up an inferior lawn and reseeding it.  Now every tree bore fruit--edible fruit, that is.  In the case of one tree, in which they took especial pride, it had originally no fruit at all--that is, none humanly edible-- yet was so beautiful that they wished to keep it.  For nine hundred years they had experimented, and now showed us this particularly lovely graceful tree, with a profuse crop of nutritious seeds.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had early decided that trees were the best food plants, requiring far less labor in tilling the soil, and bearing a larger amount of food for the same ground space; also doing much to preserve and enrich the soil.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Due regard had been paid to seasonable crops, and their fruit and nuts, grains and berries, kept on almost the year through.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> On the higher part of the country, near the backing wall of mountains, they had a real winter with snow.  Toward the south- eastern point, where there was a large valley with a lake whose outlet was subterranean, the climate was like that of California, and citrus fruits, figs, and olives grew abundantly.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> What impressed me particularly was their scheme of fertilization. Here was this little shut-in piece of land where one would have thought an ordinary people would have been starved out long ago or reduced to an annual struggle for life.  These careful culturists had worked out a perfect scheme of refeeding the soil with all that came out of it.  All the scraps and leavings of their food, plant waste from lumber work or textile industry, all the solid matter from the sewage, properly treated and combined-- everything which came from the earth went back to it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The practical result was like that in any healthy forest; an increasingly valuable soil was being built, instead of the progressive impoverishment so often seen in the rest of the world.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> When this first burst upon us we made such approving comments that they were surprised that such obvious common sense should be praised; asked what our methods were; and we had some difficulty in--well, in diverting them, by referring to the extent of our own land, and the--admitted--carelessness with which we had skimmed the cream of it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> At least we thought we had diverted them.  Later I found that besides keeping a careful and accurate account of all we told them, they had a sort of skeleton chart, on which the things we said and the things we palpably avoided saying were all set down and studied.  It really was child&#x27;s play for those profound educators to work out a painfully accurate estimate of our conditions --in some lines.  When a given line of observation seemed to lead to some very dreadful inference they always gave us the benefit of the doubt, leaving it open to further knowledge.  Some of the things we had grown to accept as perfectly natural, or as belonging to our human limitations, they literally could not have believed; and, as I have said, we had all of us joined in a tacit endeavor to conceal much of the social status at home.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Confound their grandmotherly minds!&quot; Terry said.  &quot;Of course they can&#x27;t understand a Man&#x27;s World!  They aren&#x27;t human --they&#x27;re just a pack of Fe-Fe-Females!&quot;  This was after he had to admit their parthenogenesis.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I wish our grandfatherly minds had managed as well,&quot; said Jeff. &quot;Do you really think it&#x27;s to our credit that we have muddled along with all our poverty and disease and the like?  They have peace and plenty, wealth and beauty, goodness and intellect. Pretty good people, I think!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You&#x27;ll find they have their faults too,&quot; Terry insisted; and partly in self-defense, we all three began to look for those faults of theirs.

We had expected them to be given over to what we called &quot;feminine vanity&quot;--&quot;frills and furbelows,&quot; and we found they had evolved a costume more perfect than the Chinese dress, richly beautiful when so desired, always useful, of unfailing dignity and good taste.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had expected a dull submissive monotony, and found a daring social inventiveness far beyond our own, and a mechanical and scientific development fully equal to ours.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had expected pettiness, and found a social consciousness besides which our nations looked like quarreling children-- feebleminded ones at that.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had expected jealousy, and found a broad sisterly affection, a fair-minded intelligence, to which we could produce no parallel.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had expected hysteria, and found a standard of health and vigor, a calmness of temper, to which the habit of profanity, for instance, was impossible to explain--we tried it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> All these things even Terry had to admit, but he still insisted that we should find out the other side pretty soon.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It stands to reason, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; he argued.  &quot;The whole thing&#x27;s deuced unnatural--I&#x27;d say impossible if we weren&#x27;t in it. And an unnatural condition&#x27;s sure to have unnatural results. You&#x27;ll find some awful characteristics--see if you don&#x27;t!  For instance--we don&#x27;t know yet what they do with their criminals-- their defectives--their aged.  You notice we haven&#x27;t seen any!

The delicious food had been eaten, a plate of fruit still before us.  We could look out on one side over a stretch of open country, quietly rich and lovely; on the other, the garden, with tables here and there, far apart enough for privacy.  Let me say right here that with all their careful &quot;balance of population&quot; there was no crowding in this country.

We were invited, always courteously and with free choice on our part, to address general audiences and classes of girls.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I remember the first time--and how careful we were about our clothes, and our amateur barbering.  Terry, in particular, was fussy to a degree about the cut of his beard, and so critical of our combined efforts, that we handed him the shears and told him to please himself.  We began to rather prize those beards of ours; they were almost our sole distinction among those tall and sturdy women, with their cropped hair and sexless costume.  Being offered a wide selection of garments, we had chosen according to our personal taste, and were surprised to find, on meeting large audiences, that we were the most highly decorated, especially Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He was a very impressive figure, his strong features softened by the somewhat longer hair--though he made me trim it as closely as I knew how; and he wore his richly embroidered tunic with its broad, loose girdle with quite a Henry V air.  Jeff looked more like--well, like a Huguenot Lover; and I don&#x27;t know what I looked like, only that I felt very comfortable.  When I got back to our own padded armor and its starched borders I realized with acute regret how comfortable were those Herland clothes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We scanned that audience, looking for the three bright faces we knew; but they were not to be seen.

To us, at first, these women, unavoidably ignorant of what to us was the basic commonplace of knowledge, had seemed on the plane of children, or of savages.  What we had been forced to admit, with growing acquaintance, was that they were ignorant as Plato and Aristotle were, but with a highly developed mentality quite comparable to that of Ancient Greece.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Far be it from me to lumber these pages with an account of what we so imperfectly strove to teach them.  The memorable fact is what they taught us, or some faint glimpse of it.  And at present, our major interest was not at all in the subject matter of our talk, but in the audience.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Girls--hundreds of them--eager, bright-eyed, attentive young faces; crowding questions, and, I regret to say, an increasing inability on our part to answer them effectively.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Our special guides, who were on the platform with us, and sometimes aided in clarifying a question or, oftener, an answer, noticed this effect, and closed the formal lecture part of the evening rather shortly.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Our young women will be glad to meet you,&quot; Somel suggested, &quot;to talk with you more personally, if you are willing?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Willing!  We were impatient and said as much, at which I saw a flickering little smile cross Moadine&#x27;s face.  Even then, with all those eager young things waiting to talk to us, a sudden question crossed my mind: &quot;What was their point of view?  What did they think of us?&quot;  We learned that later.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry plunged in among those young creatures with a sort of rapture, somewhat as a glad swimmer takes to the sea.  Jeff, with a rapt look on his high-bred face, approached as to a sacrament. But I was a little chilled by that last thought of mine, and kept my eyes open.  I found time to watch Jeff, even while I was surrounded by an eager group of questioners--as we all were-- and saw how his worshipping eyes, his grave courtesy, pleased and drew some of them; while others, rather stronger spirits they looked to be, drew away from his group to Terry&#x27;s or mine.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I watched Terry with special interest, knowing how he had longed for this time, and how irresistible he had always been at home.  And I could see, just in snatches, of course, how his suave and masterful approach seemed to irritate them; his too-intimate glances were vaguely resented, his compliments puzzled and annoyed. Sometimes a girl would flush, not with drooped eyelids and inviting timidity, but with anger and a quick lift of the head.  Girl after girl turned on her heel and left him, till he had but a small ring of questioners, and they, visibly, were the least &quot;girlish&quot; of the lot.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I saw him looking pleased at first, as if he thought he was making a strong impression; but, finally, casting a look at Jeff, or me, he seemed less pleased--and less.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As for me, I was most agreeably surprised.  At home I never was &quot;popular.&quot;  I had my girl friends, good ones, but they were friends--nothing else.  Also they were of somewhat the same clan, not popular in the sense of swarming admirers.  But here, to my astonishment, I found my crowd was the largest.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I have to generalize, of course, rather telescoping many impressions; but the first evening was a good sample of the impression we made.  Jeff had a following, if I may call it that, of the more sentimental--though that&#x27;s not the word I want. The less practical, perhaps; the girls who were artists of some sort, ethicists, teachers--that kind.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was reduced to a rather combative group: keen, logical, inquiring minds, not overly sensitive, the very kind he liked least; while, as for me--I became quite cocky over my general popularity.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry was furious about it.  We could hardly blame him.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Girls!&quot; he burst forth, when that evening was over and we were by ourselves once more.  &quot;Call those GIRLS!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&quot;Most delightful girls, I call them,&quot; said Jeff, his blue eyes dreamily contented.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;What do YOU call them?&quot; I mildly inquired.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Boys!  Nothing but boys, most of &#x27;em.  A standoffish, disagreeable lot at that.  Critical, impertinent youngsters.  No girls at all.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> He was angry and severe, not a little jealous, too, I think. Afterward, when he found out just what it was they did not like, he changed his manner somewhat and got on better.  He had to. For, in spite of his criticism, they were girls, and, furthermore, all the girls there were!  Always excepting our three!--with whom we presently renewed our acquaintance.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> When it came to courtship, which it soon did, I can of course best describe my own--and am least inclined to.  But of Jeff I heard somewhat; he was inclined to dwell reverently and admiringly, at some length, on the exalted sentiment and measureless perfection of his Celis; and Terry--Terry made so many false starts and met so many rebuffs, that by the time he really settled down to win Alima, he was considerably wiser.  At that, it was not smooth sailing. They broke and quarreled, over and over; he would rush off to console himself with some other fair one--the other fair one would have none of him--and he would drift back to Alima, becoming more and more devoted each time.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She never gave an inch.  A big, handsome creature, rather exceptionally strong even in that race of strong women, with a proud head and sweeping level brows that lined across above her dark eager eyes like the wide wings of a soaring hawk.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I was good friends with all three of them but best of all with Ellador, long before that feeling changed, for both of us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> From her, and from Somel, who talked very freely with me, I learned at last something of the viewpoint of Herland toward its visitors.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here they were, isolated, happy, contented, when the booming buzz of our biplane tore the air above them.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Everybody heard it--saw it--for miles and miles, word flashed all over the country, and a council was held in every town and village.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And this was their rapid determination:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;From another country.  Probably men.  Evidently highly civilized. Doubtless possessed of much valuable knowledge.  May be dangerous. Catch them if possible; tame and train them if necessary This may be a chance to re-establish a bi-sexual state for our people.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They were not afraid of us--three million highly intelligent women--or two million, counting only grown-ups--were not likely to be afraid of three young men.  We thought of them as &quot;Women,&quot; and therefore timid; but it was two thousand years since they had had anything to be afraid of, and certainly more than one thousand since they had outgrown the feeling.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We thought--at least Terry did--that we could have our pick of them. They thought--very cautiously and farsightedly--of picking us, if it seemed wise.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> All that time we were in training they studied us, analyzed us, prepared reports about us, and this information was widely disseminated all about the land.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Not a girl in that country had not been learning for months as much as could be gathered about our country, our culture, our personal characters.  No wonder their questions were hard to answer.  But I am sorry to say, when we were at last brought out and--exhibited (I hate to call it that, but that&#x27;s what it was), there was no rush of takers.  Here was poor old Terry fondly imagining that at last he was free to stray in &quot;a rosebud garden of girls&quot;--and behold! the rosebuds were all with keen appraising eye, studying us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They were interested, profoundly interested, but it was not the kind of interest we were looking for.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> To get an idea of their attitude you have to hold in mind their extremely high sense of solidarity.  They were not each choosing a lover; they hadn&#x27;t the faintest idea of love--sex-love, that is. These girls--to each of whom motherhood was a lodestar, and that motherhood exalted above a mere personal function, looked forward to as the highest social service, as the sacrament of a lifetime--were now confronted with an opportunity to make the great step of changing their whole status, of reverting to their earlier bi-sexual order of nature.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Beside this underlying consideration there was the limitless interest and curiosity in our civilization, purely impersonal, and held by an order of mind beside which we were like--schoolboys.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was small wonder that our lectures were not a success; and none at all that our, or at least Terry&#x27;s, advances were so ill received.  The reason for my own comparative success was at first far from pleasing to my pride.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We like you the best,&quot; Somel told me, &quot;because you seem more like us.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;More like a lot of women!&quot; I thought to myself disgustedly, and then remembered how little like &quot;women,&quot; in our derogatory sense, they were.

Of course, in a bi-sexual race the distinctive feature of each sex must be intensified.  But surely there are characteristics enough which belong to People, aren&#x27;t there?  That&#x27;s what I mean about you being more like us--more like People.

I thought of her most.  Afterward I turned to her like a friend when we met for the third time, and continued the acquaintance.  While Jeff&#x27;s ultra-devotion rather puzzled Celis, really put off their day of happiness, while Terry and Alima quarreled and parted, re-met and re-parted, Ellador and I grew to be close friends.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We talked and talked.  We took long walks together.  She showed me things, explained them, interpreted much that I had not understood.  Through her sympathetic intelligence I became more and more comprehending of the spirit of the people of Herland, more and more appreciative of its marvelous inner growth as well as outer perfection.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I ceased to feel a stranger, a prisoner.  There was a sense of understanding, of identity, of purpose.  We discussed--everything. And, as I traveled farther and farther, exploring the rich, sweet soul of her, my sense of pleasant friendship became but a broad foundation for such height, such breadth, such interlocked combination of feeling as left me fairly blinded with the wonder of it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As I&#x27;ve said, I had never cared very much for women, nor they for me--not Terry-fashion.

I had not come to the country with any Turkish-harem intentions, and I was no woman-worshipper like Jeff.  I just liked that girl &quot;as a friend,&quot; as we say.  That friendship grew like a tree. She was SUCH a good sport!  We did all kinds of things together. She taught me games and I taught her games, and we raced and rowed and had all manner of fun, as well as higher comradeship.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then, as I got on farther, the palace and treasures and snowy mountain ranges opened up.  I had never known there could be such a human being.  So--great.  I don&#x27;t mean talented.  She was a forester--one of the best--but it was not that gift I mean. When I say GREAT, I mean great--big, all through.  If I had known more of those women, as intimately, I should not have found her so unique; but even among them she was noble.  Her mother was an Over Mother--and her grandmother, too, I heard later.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So she told me more and more of her beautiful land; and I told her as much, yes, more than I wanted to, about mine; and we became inseparable.  Then this deeper recognition came and grew. I felt my own soul rise and lift its wings, as it were. Life got bigger.  It seemed as if I understood--as I never had before-- as if I could Do things--as if I too could grow--if she would help me. And then It came--to both of us, all at once.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> A still day--on the edge of the world, their world.

Then gradually develops such comradeship as the two temperaments allow.  Then, after marriage, there is either the establishment of a slow-growing, widely based friendship, the deepest, tenderest, sweetest of relations, all lit and warmed by the recurrent flame of love; or else that process is reversed, love cools and fades, no friendship grows, the whole relation turns from beauty to ashes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here everything was different.  There was no sex-feeling to appeal to, or practically none.

Terry was a past master in this process. He tried it here, and Alima was so affronted, so repelled, that it was weeks before he got near enough to try again.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The more coldly she denied him, the hotter his determination; he was not used to real refusal.  The approach of flattery she dismissed with laughter, gifts and such &quot;attentions&quot; we could not bring to bear, pathos and complaint of cruelty stirred only a reasoning inquiry.

The years of pioneering lay far behind them.  Theirs was a civilization in which the initial difficulties had long since been overcome.  The untroubled peace, the unmeasured plenty, the steady health, the large good will and smooth management which ordered everything, left nothing to overcome.  It was like a pleasant family in an old established, perfectly run country place.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I liked it because of my eager and continued interest in the sociological achievements involved.

The drama of the country was--to our taste--rather flat.  You see, they lacked the sex motive and, with it, jealousy.  They had no interplay of warring nations, no aristocracy and its ambitions, no wealth and poverty opposition.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I see I have said little about the economics of the place; it should have come before, but I&#x27;ll go on about the drama now.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had their own kind.  There was a most impressive array of pageantry, of processions, a sort of grand ritual, with their arts and their religion broadly blended.  The very babies joined in it. To see one of their great annual festivals, with the massed and marching stateliness of those great mothers, the young women brave and noble, beautiful and strong; and then the children, taking part as naturally as ours would frolic round a Christmas tree--it was overpowering in the impression of joyous, triumphant life.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had begun at a period when the drama, the dance, music, religion, and education were all very close together; and instead of developing them in detached lines, they had kept the connection.  Let me try again to give, if I can, a faint sense of the difference in the life view--the background and basis on which their culture rested.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Ellador told me a lot about it.  She took me to see the children, the growing girls, the special teachers.  She picked out books for me to read.  She always seemed to understand just what I wanted to know, and how to give it to me.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> While Terry and Alima struck sparks and parted--he always madly drawn to her and she to him--she must have been, or she&#x27;d never have stood the way he behaved--Ellador and I had already a deep, restful feeling, as if we&#x27;d always had one another. Jeff and Celis were happy; there was no question of that; but it didn&#x27;t seem to me as if they had the good times we did.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Well, here is the Herland child facing life--as Ellador tried to show it to me.  From the first memory, they knew Peace, Beauty, Order, Safety, Love, Wisdom, Justice, Patience, and Plenty. By &quot;plenty&quot; I mean that the babies grew up in an environment which met their needs, just as young fawns might grow up in dewy forest glades and brook-fed meadows.  And they enjoyed it as frankly and utterly as the fawns would.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They found themselves in a big bright lovely world, full of the most interesting and enchanting things to learn about and to do. The people everywhere were friendly and polite.  No Herland child ever met the overbearing rudeness we so commonly show to children.  They were People, too, from the first; the most precious part of the nation.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> In each step of the rich experience of living, they found the instance they were studying widen out into contact with an endless range of common interests.  The things they learned were RELATED, from the first; related to one another, and to the national prosperity.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It was a butterfly that made me a forester,&quot; said Ellador. &quot;I was about eleven years old, and I found a big purple-and-green butterfly on a low flower.  I caught it, very carefully, by the closed wings, as I had been told to do, and carried it to the nearest insect teacher&quot;--I made a note there to ask her what on earth an insect teacher was--&quot;to ask her its name.  She took it from me with a little cry of delight.  `Oh, you blessed child,&#x27; she said.  `Do you like obernuts?&#x27;  Of course I liked obernuts, and said so.  It is our best food-nut, you know.  `This is a female of the obernut moth,&#x27; she told me.  `They are almost gone.  We have been trying to exterminate them for centuries.  If you had not caught this one, it might have laid eggs enough to raise worms enough to destroy thousands of our nut trees--thousands of bushels of nuts--and make years and years of trouble for us.&#x27;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Everybody congratulated me.  The children all over the country were told to watch for that moth, if there were any more. I was shown the history of the creature, and an account of the damage it used to do and of how long and hard our foremothers had worked to save that tree for us.  I grew a foot, it seemed to me, and determined then and there to be a forester.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This is but an instance; she showed me many.  The big difference was that whereas our children grow up in private homes and families, with every effort made to protect and seclude them from a dangerous world, here they grew up in a wide, friendly world, and knew it for theirs, from the first.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Their child-literature was a wonderful thing.  I could have spent years following the delicate subtleties, the smooth simplicities with which they had bent that great art to the service of the child mind.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We have two life cycles: the man&#x27;s and the woman&#x27;s.  To the man there is growth, struggle, conquest, the establishment of his family, and as much further success in gain or ambition as he can achieve.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> To the woman, growth, the securing of a husband, the subordinate activities of family life, and afterward such &quot;social&quot; or charitable interests as her position allows.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here was but one cycle, and that a large one.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The child entered upon a broad open field of life, in which motherhood was the one great personal contribution to the national life, and all the rest the individual share in their common activities. Every girl I talked to, at any age above babyhood, had her cheerful determination as to what she was going to be when she grew up.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> What Terry meant by saying they had no &quot;modesty&quot; was that this great life-view had no shady places; they had a high sense of personal decorum, but no shame--no knowledge of anything to be ashamed of.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Even their shortcomings and misdeeds in childhood never were presented to them as sins; merely as errors and misplays-- as in a game.  Some of them, who were palpably less agreeable than others or who had a real weakness or fault, were treated with cheerful allowance, as a friendly group at whist would treat a poor player.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Their religion, you see, was maternal; and their ethics, based on the full perception of evolution, showed the principle of growth and the beauty of wise culture.  They had no theory of the essential opposition of good and evil; life to them was growth; their pleasure was in growing, and their duty also.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> With this background, with their sublimated mother-love, expressed in terms of widest social activity, every phase of their work was modified by its effect on the national growth.  The language itself they had deliberately clarified, simplified, made easy and beautiful, for the sake of the children.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This seemed to us a wholly incredible thing: first, that any nation should have the foresight, the strength, and the persistence to plan and fulfill such a task; and second, that women should have had so much initiative.  We have assumed, as a matter of course, that women had none; that only the man, with his natural energy and impatience of restriction, would ever invent anything.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here we found that the pressure of life upon the environment develops in the human mind its inventive reactions, regardless of sex; and further, that a fully awakened motherhood plans and works without limit, for the good of the child.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> That the children might be most nobly born, and reared in an environment calculated to allow the richest, freest growth, they had deliberately remodeled and improved the whole state.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I do not mean in the least that they stopped at that, any more than a child stops at childhood.  The most impressive part of their whole culture beyond this perfect system of child-rearing was the range of interests and associations open to them all, for life. But in the field of literature I was most struck, at first, by the child-motive.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had the same gradation of simple repetitive verse and story that we are familiar with, and the most exquisite, imaginative tales; but where, with us, these are the dribbled remnants of ancient folk myths and primitive lullabies, theirs were the exquisite work of great artists; not only simple and unfailing in appeal to the child-mind, but TRUE, true to the living world about them.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> To sit in one of their nurseries for a day was to change one&#x27;s views forever as to babyhood.  The youngest ones, rosy fatlings in their mothers&#x27; arms, or sleeping lightly in the flower-sweet air, seemed natural enough, save that they never cried.  I never heard a child cry in Herland, save once or twice at a bad fall; and then people ran to help, as we would at a scream of agony from a grown person.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Each mother had her year of glory; the time to love and learn, living closely with her child, nursing it proudly, often for two years or more.  This perhaps was one reason for their wonderful vigor.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But after the baby-year the mother was not so constantly in attendance, unless, indeed, her work was among the little ones. She was never far off, however, and her attitude toward the co-mothers, whose proud child-service was direct and continuous, was lovely to see.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As for the babies--a group of those naked darlings playing on short velvet grass, clean-swept; or rugs as soft; or in shallow pools of bright water; tumbling over with bubbling joyous baby laughter-- it was a view of infant happiness such as I had never dreamed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The babies were reared in the warmer part of the country, and gradually acclimated to the cooler heights as they grew older.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Sturdy children of ten and twelve played in the snow as joyfully as ours do; there were continuous excursions of them, from one part of the land to another, so that to each child the whole country might be home.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was all theirs, waiting for them to learn, to love, to use, to serve; as our own little boys plan to be &quot;a big soldier,&quot; or &quot;a cowboy,&quot; or whatever pleases their fancy; and our little girls plan for the kind of home they mean to have, or how many children; these planned, freely and gaily with much happy chattering, of what they would do for the country when they were grown.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was the eager happiness of the children and young people which first made me see the folly of that common notion of ours --that if life was smooth and happy, people would not enjoy it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As I studied these youngsters, vigorous, joyous, eager little creatures, and their voracious appetite for life, it shook my previous ideas so thoroughly that they have never been re-established. The steady level of good health gave them all that natural stimulus we used to call &quot;animal spirits&quot;--an odd contradiction in terms. They found themselves in an immediate environment which was agreeable and interesting, and before them stretched the years of learning and discovery, the fascinating, endless process of education.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As I looked into these methods and compared them with our own, my strange uncomfortable sense of race-humility grew apace.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Ellador could not understand my astonishment.  She explained things kindly and sweetly, but with some amazement that they needed explaining, and with sudden questions as to how we did it that left me meeker than ever.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I betook myself to Somel one day, carefully not taking Ellador.

We say:  &quot;All the world loves a lover,&quot; but to have a couple of million people watching one&#x27;s courtship--and that a difficult one--was rather embarrassing.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Tell me about your theory of education,&quot; I said.  &quot;Make it short and easy.  And, to show you what puzzles me, I&#x27;ll tell you that in our theory great stress is laid on the forced exertion of the child&#x27;s mind; we think it is good for him to overcome obstacles.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Of course it is,&quot; she unexpectedly agreed.  &quot;All our children do that--they love to.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> That puzzled me again.  If they loved to do it, how could it be educational?</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Our theory is this,&quot; she went on carefully.  &quot;Here is a young human being.  The mind is as natural a thing as the body, a thing that grows, a thing to use and enjoy.  We seek to nourish, to stimulate, to exercise the mind of a child as we do the body. There are the two main divisions in education--you have those of course?--the things it is necessary to know, and the things it is necessary to do.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;To do?  Mental exercises, you mean?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Yes.  Our general plan is this: In the matter of feeding the mind, of furnishing information, we use our best powers to meet the natural appetite of a healthy young brain; not to overfeed it, to provide such amount and variety of impressions as seem most welcome to each child.  That is the easiest part.  The other division is in arranging a properly graduated series of exercises which will best develop each mind; the common faculties we all have, and most carefully, the especial faculties some of us have. You do this also, do you not?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;In a way,&quot; I said rather lamely.  &quot;We have not so subtle and highly developed a system as you, not approaching it; but tell me more. As to the information--how do you manage?  It appears that all of you know pretty much everything--is that right?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This she laughingly disclaimed.  &quot;By no means.  We are, as you soon found out, extremely limited in knowledge.  I wish you could realize what a ferment the country is in over the new things you have told us; the passionate eagerness among thousands of us to go to your country and learn--learn--learn!  But what we do know is readily divisible into common knowledge and special knowledge.  The common knowledge we have long since learned to feed into the minds of our little ones with no waste of time or strength; the special knowledge is open to all, as they desire it.  Some of us specialize in one line only.  But most take up several --some for their regular work, some to grow with.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;To grow with?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Yes.  When one settles too close in one kind of work there is a tendency to atrophy in the disused portions of the brain. We like to keep on learning, always.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;What do you study?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;As much as we know of the different sciences.  We have, within our limits, a good deal of knowledge of anatomy, physiology, nutrition--all that pertains to a full and beautiful personal life. We have our botany and chemistry, and so on--very rudimentary, but interesting; our own history, with its accumulating psychology.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You put psychology with history--not with personal life?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Of course.  It is ours; it is among and between us, and it changes with the succeeding and improving generations.  We are at work, slowly and carefully, developing our whole people along these lines. It is glorious work--splendid!  To see the thousands of babies improving, showing stronger clearer minds, sweeter dispositions, higher capacities-- don&#x27;t you find it so in your country?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This I evaded flatly.  I remembered the cheerless claim that the human mind was no better than in its earliest period of savagery, only better informed--a statement I had never believed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We try most earnestly for two powers,&quot; Somel continued. &quot;The two that seem to us basically necessary for all noble life: a clear, far-reaching judgment, and a strong well-used will.  We spend our best efforts, all through childhood and youth, in developing these faculties, individual judgment and will.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;As part of your system of education, you mean?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Exactly.  As the most valuable part.  With the babies, as you may have noticed, we first provide an environment which feeds the mind without tiring it; all manner of simple and interesting things to do, as soon as they are old enough to do them; physical properties, of course, come first.  But as early as possible, going very carefully, not to tax the mind, we provide choices, simple choices, with very obvious causes and consequences.  You&#x27;ve noticed the games?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I had.  The children seemed always playing something; or else, sometimes, engaged in peaceful researches of their own.  I had wondered at first when they went to school, but soon found that they never did-- to their knowledge.  It was all education but no schooling.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We have been working for some sixteen hundred years, devising better and better games for children,&quot; continued Somel.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I sat aghast.  &quot;Devising games?&quot; I protested.  &quot;Making up new ones, you mean?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Exactly,&quot; she answered.  &quot;Don&#x27;t you?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then I remembered the kindergarten, and the &quot;material&quot; devised by Signora Montessori, and guardedly replied: &quot;To some extent.&quot;  But most of our games, I told her, were very old--came down from child to child, along the ages, from the remote past.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;And what is their effect?&quot; she asked.  &quot;Do they develop the faculties you wish to encourage?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Again I remembered the claims made by the advocates of &quot;sports,&quot; and again replied guardedly that that was, in part, the theory.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;But do the children LIKE it?&quot; I asked.  &quot;Having things made up and set before them that way?  Don&#x27;t they want the old games?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You can see the children,&quot; she answered.  &quot;Are yours more contented--more interested--happier?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then I thought, as in truth I never had thought before, of the dull, bored children I had seen, whining; &quot;What can I do now?&quot;; of the little groups and gangs hanging about; of the value of some one strong spirit who possessed initiative and would &quot;start something&quot;; of the children&#x27;s parties and the onerous duties of the older people set to &quot;amuse the children&quot;; also of that troubled ocean of misdirected activity we call &quot;mischief,&quot; the foolish, destructive, sometimes evil things done by unoccupied children.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;No,&quot; said I grimly.  &quot;I don&#x27;t think they are.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The Herland child was born not only into a world carefully prepared, full of the most fascinating materials and opportunities to learn, but into the society of plentiful numbers of teachers, teachers born and trained, whose business it was to accompany the children along that, to us, impossible thing--the royal road to learning.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> There was no mystery in their methods.  Being adapted to children it was at least comprehensible to adults.  I spent many days with the little ones, sometimes with Ellador, sometimes without, and began to feel a crushing pity for my own childhood, and for all others that I had known.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The houses and gardens planned for babies had in them nothing to hurt--no stairs, no corners, no small loose objects to swallow, no fire--just a babies&#x27; paradise.  They were taught, as rapidly as feasible, to use and control their own bodies, and never did I see such sure-footed, steady-handed, clear-headed little things. It was a joy to watch a row of toddlers learning to walk, not only on a level floor, but, a little later, on a sort of rubber rail raised an inch or two above the soft turf or heavy rugs, and falling off with shrieks of infant joy, to rush back to the end of the line and try again.  Surely we have noticed how children love to get up on something and walk along it!  But we have never thought to provide that simple and inexhaustible form of amusement and physical education for the young.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Water they had, of course, and could swim even before they walked.  If I feared at first the effects of a too intensive system of culture, that fear was dissipated by seeing the long sunny days of pure physical merriment and natural sleep in which these heavenly babies passed their first years.

There were some common features in certain groups of religions, but the one always present was this Power, and the things which must be done or not done because of it.  It was not hard to trace our human imagery of the Divine Force up through successive stages of bloodthirsty, sensual, proud, and cruel gods of early times to the conception of a Common Father with its corollary of a Common Brotherhood.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This pleased her very much, and when I expatiated on the Omniscience, Omnipotence, Omnipresence, and so on, of our God, and of the loving kindness taught by his Son, she was much impressed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The story of the Virgin birth naturally did not astonish her, but she was greatly puzzled by the Sacrifice, and still more by the Devil, and the theory of Damnation.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> When in an inadvertent moment I said that certain sects had believed in infant damnation--and explained it--she sat very still indeed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They believed that God was Love--and Wisdom--and Power?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Yes--all of that.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Her eyes grew large, her face ghastly pale.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;And yet that such a God could put little new babies to burn --for eternity?&quot;  She fell into a sudden shuddering and left me, running swiftly to the nearest temple.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Every smallest village had its temple, and in those gracious retreats sat wise and noble women, quietly busy at some work of their own until they were wanted, always ready to give comfort, light, or help, to any applicant.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Ellador told me afterward how easily this grief of hers was assuaged, and seemed ashamed of not having helped herself out of it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You see, we are not accustomed to horrible ideas,&quot; she said, coming back to me rather apologetically.  &quot;We haven&#x27;t any.

All our folks were swept away at once, and then, after that time of despair, came those wonder children--the first.  And then the whole breathless hope of us was for THEIR children--if they should have them.  And they did!  Then there was the period of pride and triumph till we grew too numerous; and after that, when it all came down to one child apiece, we began to really work--to make better ones.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;But how does this account for such a radical difference in your religion?&quot; I persisted.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She said she couldn&#x27;t talk about the difference very intelligently, not being familiar with other religions, but that theirs seemed simple enough.  Their great Mother Spirit was to them what their own motherhood was--only magnified beyond human limits.

We have preventive measures, and cures; sometimes we have to `send the patient to bed,&#x27; as it were; but that&#x27;s not a punishment--it&#x27;s only part of the treatment,&quot; she explained.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then studying my point of view more closely, she added: &quot;You see, we recognize, in our human motherhood, a great tender limitless uplifting force--patience and wisdom and all subtlety of delicate method.  We credit God--our idea of God--with all that and more.  Our mothers are not angry with us--why should God be?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Does God mean a person to you?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This she thought over a little.  &quot;Why--in trying to get close to it in our minds we personify the idea, naturally; but we certainly do not assume a Big Woman somewhere, who is God. What we call God is a Pervading Power, you know, an Indwelling Spirit, something inside of us that we want more of.  Is your God a Big Man?&quot; she asked innocently.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Why--yes, to most of us, I think.

Your children grow up in a world where everybody loves them.  They find life made rich and happy for them by the diffused love and wisdom of all mothers.  So it is easy for you to think of God in the terms of a similar diffused and competent love.  I think you are far nearer right than we are.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;What I cannot understand,&quot; she pursued carefully, &quot;is your preservation of such a very ancient state of mind.

But religion is different.  You see, our religions come from behind us, and are initiated by some great teacher who is dead.  He is supposed to have known the whole thing and taught it, finally.

Their relation to it, similarly, was filial, a loving appreciation and a glad fulfillment of its high purposes.  Then, being nothing if not practical, they set their keen and active minds to discover the kind of conduct expected of them.  This worked out in a most admirable system of ethics. The principle of Love was universally recognized--and used.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Patience, gentleness, courtesy, all that we call &quot;good breeding,&quot; was part of their code of conduct.  But where they went far beyond us was in the special application of religious feeling to every field of life.  They had no ritual, no little set of performances called &quot;divine service,&quot; save those religious pageants I have spoken of, and those were as much educational as religious, and as much social as either.  But they had a clear established connection between everything they did--and God.  Their cleanliness, their health, their exquisite order, the rich peaceful beauty of the whole land, the happiness of the children, and above all the constant progress they made--all this was their religion.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They applied their minds to the thought of God, and worked out the theory that such an inner power demanded outward expression.

These, whatever their work might be, gave certain hours to the Temple Service, which meant being there with all their love and wisdom and trained thought, to smooth out rough places for anyone who needed it.  Sometimes it was a real grief, very rarely a quarrel, most often a perplexity; even in Herland the human soul had its hours of darkness.  But all through the country their best and wisest were ready to give help.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> If the difficulty was unusually profound, the applicant was directed to someone more specially experienced in that line of thought.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here was a religion which gave to the searching mind a rational basis in life, the concept of an immense Loving Power working steadily out through them, toward good.  It gave to the &quot;soul&quot; that sense of contact with the inmost force, of perception of the uttermost purpose, which we always crave.  It gave to the &quot;heart&quot; the blessed feeling of being loved, loved and UNDERSTOOD.  It gave clear, simple, rational directions as to how we should live--and why. And for ritual it gave first those triumphant group demonstrations, when with a union of all the arts, the revivifying combination of great multitudes moved rhythmically with march and dance, song and music, among their own noblest products and the open beauty of their groves and hills.  Second, it gave these numerous little centers of wisdom where the least wise could go to the most wise and be helped.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It is beautiful!&quot; I cried enthusiastically.  &quot;It is the most practical, comforting, progressive religion I ever heard of.

The woman may have imagined the conditions of married life to be different; but what she imagined, was ignorant of, or might have preferred, did not seriously matter.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I can see clearly and speak calmly about this now, writing after a lapse of years, years full of growth and education, but at the time it was rather hard sledding for all of us--especially for Terry.  Poor Terry!  You see, in any other imaginable marriage among the peoples of the earth, whether the woman were black, red, yellow, brown, or white; whether she were ignorant or educated, submissive or rebellious, she would have behind her the marriage tradition of our general history.  This tradition relates the woman to the man.  He goes on with his business, and she adapts herself to him and to it.  Even in citizenship, by some strange hocus-pocus, that fact of birth and geography was waved aside, and the woman automatically acquired the nationality of her husband.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Well--here were we, three aliens in this land of women.  It was small in area, and the external differences were not so great as to astound us.  We did not yet appreciate the differences between the race-mind of this people and ours.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> In the first place, they were a &quot;pure stock&quot; of two thousand uninterrupted years.  Where we have some long connected lines of thought and feeling, together with a wide range of differences, often irreconcilable, these people were smoothly and firmly agreed on most of the basic principles of their life; and not only agreed in principle, but accustomed for these sixty-odd generations to act on those principles.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This is one thing which we did not understand--had made no allowance for.  When in our pre-marital discussions one of those dear girls had said: &quot;We understand it thus and thus,&quot; or &quot;We hold such and such to be true,&quot; we men, in our own deep-seated convictions of the power of love, and our easy views about beliefs and principles, fondly imagined that we could convince them otherwise.  What we imagined, before marriage, did not matter any more than what an average innocent young girl imagines. We found the facts to be different.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was not that they did not love us; they did, deeply and warmly.  But there are you again--what they meant by &quot;love&quot; and what we meant by &quot;love&quot; were so different.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Perhaps it seems rather cold-blooded to say &quot;we&quot; and &quot;they,&quot; as if we were not separate couples, with our separate joys and sorrows, but our positions as aliens drove us together constantly. The whole strange experience had made our friendship more close and intimate than it would ever have become in a free and easy lifetime among our own people.  Also, as men, with our masculine tradition of far more than two thousand years, we were a unit, small but firm, against this far larger unit of feminine tradition.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I think I can make clear the points of difference without a too painful explicitness.  The more external disagreement was in the matter of &quot;the home,&quot; and the housekeeping duties and pleasures we, by instinct and long education, supposed to be inherently appropriate to women.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I will give two illustrations, one away up, and the other away down, to show how completely disappointed we were in this regard.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> For the lower one, try to imagine a male ant, coming from some state of existence where ants live in pairs, endeavoring to set up housekeeping with a female ant from a highly developed anthill.  This female ant might regard him with intense personal affection, but her ideas of parentage and economic management would be on a very different scale from his.  Now, of course, if she was a stray female in a country of pairing ants, he might have had his way with her; but if he was a stray male in an anthill--!</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> For the higher one, try to imagine a devoted and impassioned man trying to set up housekeeping with a lady angel, a real wings-and-harp-and-halo angel, accustomed to fulfilling divine missions all over interstellar space.  This angel might love the man with an affection quite beyond his power of return or even of appreciation, but her ideas of service and duty would be on a very different scale from his.  Of course, if she was a stray angel in a country of men, he might have had his way with her; but if he was a stray man among angels--!</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Terry, at his worst, in a black fury for which, as a man, I must have some sympathy, preferred the ant simile.  More of Terry and his special troubles later.  It was hard on Terry.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Jeff--well, Jeff always had a streak that was too good for this world!  He&#x27;s the kind that would have made a saintly priest in parentagearlier times.  He accepted the angel theory, swallowed it whole, tried to force it on us--with varying effect.  He so worshipped Celis, and not only Celis, but what she represented; he had become so deeply convinced of the almost supernatural advantages of this country and people, that he took his medicine like a--I cannot say &quot;like a man,&quot; but more as if he wasn&#x27;t one.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Don&#x27;t misunderstand me for a moment.  Dear old Jeff was no milksop or molly-coddle either.  He was a strong, brave, efficient man, and an excellent fighter when fighting was necessary.  But there was always this angel streak in him.  It was rather a wonder, Terry being so different, that he really loved Jeff as he did; but it happens so sometimes, in spite of the difference--perhaps because of it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> As for me, I stood between.  I was no such gay Lothario as Terry, and no such Galahad as Jeff.  But for all my limitations I think I had the habit of using my brains in regard to behavior rather more frequently than either of them.  I had to use brain- power now, I can tell you.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The big point at issue between us and our wives was, as may easily be imagined, in the very nature of the relation.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Wives!

How could they?  Back in their prehistoric records of polygamy and slavery there were no ideals of wifehood as we know it, and since then no possibility of forming such.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;The only thing they can think of about a man is FATHERHOOD!&quot; said Terry in high scorn.  &quot;FATHERHOOD!&quot;  As if a man was always wanting to be a FATHER!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This also was correct.  They had their long, wide, deep, rich experience of Motherhood, and their only perception of the value of a male creature as such was for Fatherhood.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Aside from that, of course, was the whole range of personal love, love which as Jeff earnestly phrased it &quot;passeth the love of women!&quot;  It did, too.  I can give no idea--either now, after long and happy experience of it, or as it seemed then, in the first measureless wonder--of the beauty and power of the love they gave us.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Even Alima--who had a more stormy temperament than either of the others, and who, heaven knows, had far more provocation-- even Alima was patience and tenderness and wisdom personified to the man she loved, until he--but I haven&#x27;t got to that yet.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> These, as Terry put it, &quot;alleged or so-called wives&quot; of ours, went right on with their profession as foresters.  We, having no special learnings, had long since qualified as assistants.  We had to do something, if only to pass the time, and it had to be work --we couldn&#x27;t be playing forever.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This kept us out of doors with those dear girls, and more or less together--too much together sometimes.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> These people had, it now became clear to us, the highest, keenest, most delicate sense of personal privacy, but not the faintest idea of that SOLITUDE A DEUX we are so fond of.  They had, every one of them, the &quot;two rooms and a bath&quot; theory realized. From earliest childhood each had a separate bedroom with toilet conveniences, and one of the marks of coming of age was the addition of an outer room in which to receive friends.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Long since we had been given our own two rooms apiece, and as being of a different sex and race, these were in a separate house.  It seemed to be recognized that we should breathe easier if able to free our minds in real seclusion.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> For food we either went to any convenient eating-house, ordered a meal brought in, or took it with us to the woods, always and equally good.  All this we had become used to and enjoyed--in our courting days.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> After marriage there arose in us a somewhat unexpected urge of feeling that called for a separate house; but this feeling found no response in the hearts of those fair ladies.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We ARE alone, dear,&quot; Ellador explained to me with gentle patience.  &quot;We are alone in these great forests; we may go and eat in any little summer-house--just we two, or have a separate table anywhere--or even have a separate meal in our own rooms. How could we be aloner?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This was all very true.  We had our pleasant mutual solitude about our work, and our pleasant evening talks in their apartments or ours; we had, as it were, all the pleasures of courtship carried right on; but we had no sense of--perhaps it may be called possession.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Might as well not be married at all,&quot; growled Terry.  &quot;They only got up that ceremony to please us--please Jeff, mostly. They&#x27;ve no real idea of being married.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I tried my best to get Ellador&#x27;s point of view, and naturally I tried to give her mine.  Of course, what we, as men, wanted to make them see was that there were other, and as we proudly said &quot;higher,&quot; uses in this relation than what Terry called &quot;mere parentage.&quot; In the highest terms I knew I tried to explain this to Ellador.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Anything higher than for mutual love to hope to give life, as we did?&quot; she said.  &quot;How is it higher?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It develops love,&quot; I explained.  &quot;All the power of beautiful permanent mated love comes through this higher development.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asked gently.  &quot;How do you know that it was so developed?  There are some birds who love each other so that they mope and pine if separated, and never pair again if one dies, but they never mate except in the mating season. Among your people do you find high and lasting affection appearing in proportion to this indulgence?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It is a very awkward thing, sometimes, to have a logical mind.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course I knew about those monogamous birds and beasts too, that mate for life and show every sign of mutual affection, without ever having stretched the sex relationship beyond its original range.  But what of it?</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Those are lower forms of life!&quot; I protested.  &quot;They have no capacity for faithful and affectionate, and apparently happy-- but oh, my dear! my dear!--what can they know of such a love as draws us together?  Why, to touch you--to be near you--to come closer and closer--to lose myself in you--surely you feel it too, do you not?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I came nearer.

There was something so powerful, so large and changeless, in those eyes that I could not sweep her off her feet by my own emotion as I had unconsciously assumed would be the case.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It made me feel as, one might imagine, a man might feel who loved a goddess--not a Venus, though!  She did not resent my attitude, did not repel it, did not in the least fear it, evidently. There was not a shade of that timid withdrawal or pretty resistance which are so--provocative.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You see, dearest,&quot; she said, &quot;you have to be patient with us. We are not like the women of your country.  We are Mothers, and we are People, but we have not specialized in this line.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We&quot; and &quot;we&quot; and &quot;we&quot;--it was so hard to get her to be personal.  And, as I thought that, I suddenly remembered how we were always criticizing OUR women for BEING so personal.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then I did my earnest best to picture to her the sweet intense joy of married lovers, and the result in higher stimulus to all creative work.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Do you mean,&quot; she asked quite calmly, as if I was not holding her cool firm hands in my hot and rather quivering ones, &quot;that with you, when people marry, they go right on doing this in season and out of season, with no thought of children at all?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;They do,&quot; I said, with some bitterness.  &quot;They are not mere parents.  They are men and women, and they love each other.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;How long?&quot; asked Ellador, rather unexpectedly.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;How long?&quot; I repeated, a little dashed.  &quot;Why as long as they live.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;There is something very beautiful in the idea,&quot; she admitted, still as if she were discussing life on Mars.  &quot;This climactic expression, which, in all the other life-forms, has but the one purpose, has with you become specialized to higher, purer, nobler uses.  It has-- I judge from what you tell me--the most ennobling effect on character. People marry, not only for parentage, but for this exquisite interchange --and, as a result, you have a world full of continuous lovers, ardent, happy, mutually devoted, always living on that high tide of supreme emotion which we had supposed to belong only to one season and one use. And you say it has other results, stimulating all high creative work. That must mean floods, oceans of such work, blossoming from this intense happiness of every married pair!  It is a beautiful idea!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She was silent, thinking.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So was I.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She slipped one hand free, and was stroking my hair with it in a gentle motherly way.  I bowed my hot head on her shoulder and felt a dim sense of peace, a restfulness which was very pleasant.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You must take me there someday, darling,&quot; she was saying. &quot;It is not only that I love you so much, I want to see your country --your people--your mother--&quot; she paused reverently. &quot;Oh, how I shall love your mother!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I had not been in love many times--my experience did not compare with Terry&#x27;s.  But such as I had was so different from this that I was perplexed, and full of mixed feelings: partly a growing sense of common ground between us, a pleasant rested calm feeling, which I had imagined could only be attained in one way; and partly a bewildered resentment because what I found was not what I had looked for.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was their confounded psychology!  Here they were with this profound highly developed system of education so bred into them that even if they were not teachers by profession they all had a general proficiency in it--it was second nature to them.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And no child, stormily demanding a cookie &quot;between meals,&quot; was ever more subtly diverted into an interest in house-building than was I when I found an apparently imperative demand had disappeared without my noticing it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And all the time those tender mother eyes, those keen scientific eyes, noting every condition and circumstance, and learning how to &quot;take time by the forelock&quot; and avoid discussion before occasion arose.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I was amazed at the results.  I found that much, very much, of what I had honestly supposed to be a physiological necessity was a psychological necessity--or so believed.  I found, after my ideas of what was essential had changed, that my feelings changed also. And more than all, I found this--a factor of enormous weight--these women were not provocative.  That made an immense difference.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The thing that Terry had so complained of when we first came--that they weren&#x27;t &quot;feminine,&quot; they lacked &quot;charm,&quot; now became a great comfort.  Their vigorous beauty was an aesthetic pleasure, not an irritant.  Their dress and ornaments had not a touch of the &quot;come-and-find-me&quot; element.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Even with my own Ellador, my wife, who had for a time unveiled a woman&#x27;s heart and faced the strange new hope and joy of dual parentage, she afterward withdrew again into the same good comrade she had been at first.  They were women, PLUS, and so much plus that when they did not choose to let the womanness appear, you could not find it anywhere.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I don&#x27;t say it was easy for me; it wasn&#x27;t.  But when I made appeal to her sympathies I came up against another immovable wall. She was sorry, honestly sorry, for my distresses, and made all manner of thoughtful suggestions, often quite useful, as well as the wise foresight I have mentioned above, which often saved all difficulty before it arose; but her sympathy did not alter her convictions.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;If I thought it was really right and necessary, I could perhaps bring myself to it, for your sake, dear; but I do not want to--not at all.  You would not have a mere submission, would you? That is not the kind of high romantic love you spoke of, surely? It is a pity, of course, that you should have to adjust your highly specialized faculties to our unspecialized ones.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Confound it!

Here I&#x27;d have all my energies focused on one wish, and before I knew it she&#x27;d have them dissipated in one direction or another, some subject of discussion that began just at the point I was talking about and ended miles away.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It must not be imagined that I was just repelled, ignored, left to cherish a grievance.  Not at all.  My happiness was in the hands of a larger, sweeter womanhood than I had ever imagined.  Before our marriage my own ardor had perhaps blinded me to much of this. I was madly in love with not so much what was there as with what I supposed to be there.  Now I found an endlessly beautiful undiscovered country to explore, and in it the sweetest wisdom and understanding.  It was as if I had come to some new place and people, with a desire to eat at all hours, and no other interests in particular; and as if my hosts, instead of merely saying, &quot;You shall not eat,&quot; had presently aroused in me a lively desire for music, for pictures, for games, for exercise, for playing in the water, for running some ingenious machine; and, in the multitude of my satisfactions, I forgot the one point which was not satisfied, and got along very well until mealtime.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> One of the cleverest and most ingenious of these tricks was only clear to me many years after, when we were so wholly at one on this subject that I could laugh at my own predicament then. It was this: You see, with us, women are kept as different as possible and as feminine as possible.  We men have our own world, with only men in it; we get tired of our ultra-maleness and turn gladly to the ultra-femaleness.  Also, in keeping our women as feminine as possible, we see to it that when we turn to them we find the thing we want always in evidence.  Well, the atmosphere of this place was anything but seductive.  The very numbers of these human women, always in human relation, made them anything but alluring.  When, in spite of this, my hereditary instincts and race-traditions made me long for the feminine response in Ellador, instead of withdrawing so that I should want her more, she deliberately gave me a little too much of her society. --always de-feminized, as it were.  It was awfully funny, really.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Here was I, with an Ideal in mind, for which I hotly longed, and here was she, deliberately obtruding in the foreground of my consciousness a Fact--a fact which I coolly enjoyed, but which actually interfered with what I wanted.  I see now clearly enough why a certain kind of man, like Sir Almroth Wright, resents the professional development of women.  It gets in the way of the sex ideal; it temporarily covers and excludes femininity.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course, in this case, I was so fond of Ellador my friend, of Ellador my professional companion, that I necessarily enjoyed her society on any terms.  Only--when I had had her with me in her de-feminine capacity for a sixteen-hour day, I could go to my own room and sleep without dreaming about her.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The witch!  If ever anybody worked to woo and win and hold a human soul, she did, great superwoman that she was.  I couldn&#x27;t then half comprehend the skill of it, the wonder.  But this I soon began to find: that under all our cultivated attitude of mind toward women, there is an older, deeper, more &quot;natural&quot; feeling, the restful reverence which looks up to the Mother sex.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> So we grew together in friendship and happiness, Ellador and I, and so did Jeff and Celis.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> When it comes to Terry&#x27;s part of it, and Alima&#x27;s, I&#x27;m sorry-- and I&#x27;m ashamed.  Of course I blame her somewhat.  She wasn&#x27;t as fine a psychologist as Ellador, and what&#x27;s more, I think she had a far-descended atavistic trace of more marked femaleness, never apparent till Terry called it out.  But when all is said, it doesn&#x27;t excuse him.  I hadn&#x27;t realized to the full Terry&#x27;s character --I couldn&#x27;t, being a man.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The position was the same as with us, of course, only with these distinctions.  Alima, a shade more alluring, and several shades less able as a practical psychologist; Terry, a hundredfold more demanding--and proportionately less reasonable.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Things grew strained very soon between them.  I fancy at first, when they were together, in her great hope of parentage and his keen joy of conquest--that Terry was inconsiderate.  In fact, I know it, from things he said.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You needn&#x27;t talk to me,&quot; he snapped at Jeff one day, just before our weddings.  &quot;There never was a woman yet that did not enjoy being MASTERED.

When he swung a chair over his head one sprang in the air and caught it, two threw themselves bodily upon him and forced him to the floor; it was only the work of a few moments to have him tied hand and foot, and then, in sheer pity for his futile rage, to anesthetize him.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Alima was in a cold fury.

It must be like the biological change you told me about when the second sex was introduced--a far greater movement, constant change, with new possibilities of growth.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I had told her of the later biological theories of sex, and she was deeply convinced of the superior advantages of having two, the superiority of a world with men in it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We have done what we could alone; perhaps we have some things better in a quiet way, but you have the whole world--all the people of the different nations--all the long rich history behind you--all the wonderful new knowledge.  Oh, I just can&#x27;t wait to see it!&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> What could I do?  I told her in so many words that we had our unsolved problems, that we had dishonesty and corruption, vice and crime, disease and insanity, prisons and hospitals; and it made no more impression on her than it would to tell a South Sea Islander about the temperature of the Arctic Circle.  She could intellectually see that it was bad to have those things; but she could not FEEL it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had quite easily come to accept the Herland life as normal, because it was normal--none of us make any outcry over mere health and peace and happy industry.  And the abnormal, to which we are all so sadly well acclimated, she had never seen.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> The two things she cared most to hear about, and wanted most to see, were these: the beautiful relation of marriage and the lovely women who were mothers and nothing else; beyond these her keen, active mind hungered eagerly for the world life.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I&#x27;m almost as anxious to go as you are yourself,&quot; she insisted, &quot;and you must be desperately homesick.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I assured her that no one could be homesick in such a paradise as theirs, but she would have none of it.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Oh, yes--I know.  It&#x27;s like those little tropical islands you&#x27;ve told me about, shining like jewels in the big blue sea--I can&#x27;t wait to see the sea!  The little island may be as perfect as a garden, but you always want to get back to your own big country, don&#x27;t you? Even if it is bad in some ways?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Ellador was more than willing.  But the nearer it came to our really going, and to my having to take her back to our &quot;civilization,&quot; after the clean peace and beauty of theirs, the more I began to dread it, and the more I tried to explain.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course I had been homesick at first, while we were prisoners, before I had Ellador.  And of course I had, at first, rather idealized my country and its ways, in describing it.  Also, I had always accepted certain evils as integral parts of our civilization and never dwelt on them at all.  Even when I tried to tell her the worst, I never remembered some things--which, when she came to see them, impressed her at once, as they had never impressed me. Now, in my efforts at explanation, I began to see both ways more keenly than I had before; to see the painful defects of my own land, the marvelous gains of this.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> In missing men we three visitors had naturally missed the larger part of life, and had unconsciously assumed that they must miss it too.  It took me a long time to realize--Terry never did realize--how little it meant to them.  When we say MEN, MAN, MANLY, MANHOOD, and all the other masculine derivatives, we have in the background of our minds a huge vague crowded picture of the world and all its activities.  To grow up and &quot;be a man,&quot; to &quot;act like a man&quot;--the meaning and connotation is wide indeed. That vast background is full of marching columns of men, of changing lines of men, of long processions of men; of men steering their ships into new seas, exploring unknown mountains, breaking horses, herding cattle, ploughing and sowing and reaping, toiling at the forge and furnace, digging in the mine, building roads and bridges and high cathedrals, managing great businesses, teaching in all the colleges, preaching in all the churches; of men everywhere, doing everything--&quot;the world.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> And when we say WOMEN, we think FEMALE--the sex.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But to these women, in the unbroken sweep of this two- thousand-year-old feminine civilization, the word WOMAN called up all that big background, so far as they had gone in social development; and the word MAN meant to them only MALE--the sex.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of course we could TELL them that in our world men did everything; but that did not alter the background of their minds. That man, &quot;the male,&quot; did all these things was to them a statement, making no more change in the point of view than was made in ours when we first faced the astounding fact--to us--that in Herland women were &quot;the world.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> We had been living there more than a year.  We had learned their limited history, with its straight, smooth, upreaching lines, reaching higher and going faster up to the smooth comfort of their present life.  We had learned a little of their psychology, a much wider field than the history, but here we could not follow so readily.  We were now well used to seeing women not as females but as people; people of all sorts, doing every kind of work.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This outbreak of Terry&#x27;s, and the strong reaction against it, gave us a new light on their genuine femininity.  This was given me with great clearness by both Ellador and Somel.  The feeling was the same--sick revulsion and horror, such as would be felt at some climactic blasphemy.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> They had no faintest approach to such a thing in their minds, knowing nothing of the custom of marital indulgence among us. To them the one high purpose of motherhood had been for so long the governing law of life, and the contribution of the father, though known to them, so distinctly another method to the same end, that they could not, with all their effort, get the point of view of the male creature whose desires quite ignore parentage and seek only for what we euphoniously term &quot;the joys of love.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> When I tried to tell Ellador that women too felt so, with us, she drew away from me, and tried hard to grasp intellectually what she could in no way sympathize with.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;You mean--that with you--love between man and woman expresses itself in that way--without regard to motherhood?

It is love we think of--the deep sweet love between two.

Do other animals--in your country?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;We are not animals!&quot; I replied with some sharpness. &quot;At least we are something more--something higher.  This is a far nobler and more beautiful relation, as I have explained before. Your view seems to us rather--shall I say, practical?  Prosaic? Merely a means to an end!  With us--oh, my dear girl--cannot you see?  Cannot you feel?  It is the last, sweetest, highest consummation of mutual love.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She was impressed visibly.  She trembled in my arms, as I held her close, kissing her hungrily.  But there rose in her eyes that look I knew so well, that remote clear look as if she had gone far away even though I held her beautiful body so close, and was now on some snowy mountain regarding me from a distance.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I feel it quite clearly,&quot; she said to me.  &quot;It gives me a deep sympathy with what you feel, no doubt more strongly still.

Until I am sure of that, of course I cannot do as you wish.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Ellador, at times like this, always reminded me of Epictetus. &quot;I will put you in prison!&quot; said his master.  &quot;My body, you mean,&quot; replied Epictetus calmly.  &quot;I will cut your head off,&quot; said his master.  &quot;Have I said that my head could not be cut off?&quot;  A difficult person, Epictetus.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> What is this miracle by which a woman, even in your arms, may withdraw herself, utterly disappear till what you hold is as inaccessible as the face of a cliff?</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Be patient with me, dear,&quot; she urged sweetly.  &quot;I know it is hard for you.

After all, Alima was his wife, you know,&quot; I urged, feeling at the moment a sudden burst of sympathy for poor Terry.  For a man of his temperament --and habits--it must have been an unbearable situation.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But Ellador, for all her wide intellectual grasp, and the broad sympathy in which their religion trained them, could not make allowance for such--to her--sacrilegious brutality.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> It was the more difficult to explain to her, because we three, in our constant talks and lectures about the rest of the world, had naturally avoided the seamy side; not so much from a desire to deceive, but from wishing to put the best foot foremost for our civilization, in the face of the beauty and comfort of theirs.  Also, we really thought some things were right, or at least unavoidable, which we could readily see would be repugnant to them, and therefore did not discuss.  Again there was much of our world&#x27;s life which we, being used to it, had not noticed as anything worth describing.  And still further, there was about these women a colossal innocence upon which many of the things we did say had made no impression whatever.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I am thus explicit about it because it shows how unexpectedly strong was the impression made upon Ellador when she at last entered our civilization.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She urged me to be patient, and I was patient.  You see, I loved her so much that even the restrictions she so firmly established left me much happiness.  We were lovers, and there is surely delight enough in that.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Do not imagine that these young women utterly refused &quot;the Great New Hope,&quot; as they called it, that of dual parentage.  For that they had agreed to marry us, though the marrying part of it was a concession to our prejudices rather than theirs.  To them the process was the holy thing--and they meant to keep it holy.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> But so far only Celis, her blue eyes swimming in happy tears, her heart lifted with that tide of race-motherhood which was their supreme passion, could with ineffable joy and pride announce that she was to be a mother.  &quot;The New Motherhood&quot; they called it, and the whole country knew.  There was no pleasure, no service, no honor in all the land that Celis might not have had.  Almost like the breathless reverence with which, two thousand years ago, that dwindling band of women had watched the miracle of virgin birth, was the deep awe and warm expectancy with which they greeted this new miracle of union.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> All mothers in that land were holy.  To them, for long ages, the approach to motherhood has been by the most intense and exquisite love and longing, by the Supreme Desire, the overmastering demand for a child.  Every thought they held in connection with the processes of maternity was open to the day, simple yet sacred.  Every woman of them placed motherhood not only higher than other duties, but so far higher that there were no other duties, one might almost say. All their wide mutual love, all the subtle interplay of mutual friendship and service, the urge of progressive thought and invention, the deepest religious emotion, every feeling and every act was related to this great central Power, to the River of Life pouring through them, which made them the bearers of the very Spirit of God.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Of all this I learned more and more--from their books, from talk, especially from Ellador.  She was at first, for a brief moment, envious of her friend--a thought she put away from her at once and forever.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;It is better,&quot; she said to me.  &quot;It is much better that it has not come to me yet--to us, that is.  For if I am to go with you to your country, we may have `adventures by sea and land,&#x27; as you say [and as in truth we did], and it might not be at all safe for a baby. So we won&#x27;t try again, dear, till it is safe--will we?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This was a hard saying for a very loving husband.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Unless,&quot; she went on, &quot;if one is coming, you will leave me behind. You can come back, you know--and I shall have the child.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Then that deep ancient chill of male jealousy of even his own progeny touched my heart.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;I&#x27;d rather have you, Ellador, than all the children in the world. I&#x27;d rather have you with me--on your own terms--than not to have you.&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> This was a very stupid saying.  Of course I would!  For if she wasn&#x27;t there I should want all of her and have none of her.  But if she went along as a sort of sublimated sister--only much closer and warmer than that, really--why I should have all of her but that one thing.  And I was beginning to find that Ellador&#x27;s friendship, Ellador&#x27;s comradeship, Ellador&#x27;s sisterly affection, Ellador&#x27;s perfectly sincere love--none the less deep that she held it back on a definite line of reserve--were enough to live on very happily.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I find it quite beyond me to describe what this woman was to me.  We talk fine things about women, but in our hearts we know that they are very limited beings--most of them. We honor them for their functional powers, even while we dishonor them by our use of it; we honor them for their carefully enforced virtue, even while we show by our own conduct how little we think of that virtue; we value them, sincerely, for the perverted maternal activities which make our wives the most comfortable of servants, bound to us for life with the wages wholly at our own decision, their whole business, outside of the temporary duties of such motherhood as they may achieve, to meet our needs in every way.  Oh, we value them, all right, &quot;in their place,&quot; which place is the home, where they perform that mixture of duties so ably described by Mrs. Josephine Dodge Daskam Bacon, in which the services of &quot;a mistress&quot; are carefully specified. She is a very clear writer, Mrs. J. D. D. Bacon, and understands her subject--from her own point of view.  But--that combination of industries, while convenient, and in a way economical, does not arouse the kind of emotion commanded by the women of Herland. These were women one had to love &quot;up,&quot; very high up, instead of down. They were not pets.  They were not servants. They were not timid, inexperienced, weak.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> After I got over the jar to my pride (which Jeff, I truly think, never felt--he was a born worshipper, and which Terry never got over--he was quite clear in his ideas of &quot;the position of women&quot;), I found that loving &quot;up&quot; was a very good sensation after all. It gave me a queer feeling, way down deep, as of the stirring of some ancient dim prehistoric consciousness, a feeling that they were right somehow--that this was the way to feel.  It was like--coming home to mother.  I don&#x27;t mean the underflannels- and-doughnuts mother, the fussy person that waits on you and spoils you and doesn&#x27;t really know you.  I mean the feeling that a very little child would have, who had been lost--for ever so long.  It was a sense of getting home; of being clean and rested; of safety and yet freedom; of love that was always there, warm like sunshine in May, not hot like a stove or a featherbed--a love that didn&#x27;t irritate and didn&#x27;t smother.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> I looked at Ellador as if I hadn&#x27;t seen her before.  &quot;If you won&#x27;t go,&quot; I said, &quot;I&#x27;ll get Terry to the coast and come back alone. You can let me down a rope.  And if you will go--why you blessed wonder-woman--I would rather live with you all my life--like this--than to have any other woman I ever saw, or any number of them, to do as I like with.  Will you come?&quot;</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> She was keen for coming.  So the plans went on.  She&#x27;d have liked to wait for that Marvel of Celis&#x27;s, but Terry had no such desire. He was crazy to be out of it all.  It made him sick, he said, SICK; this everlasting mother-mother-mothering. I don&#x27;t think Terry had what the phrenologists call &quot;the lump of philoprogenitiveness&quot; at all well developed.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;Morbid one-sided cripples,&quot; he called them, even when from his window he could see their splendid vigor and beauty; even while Moadine, as patient and friendly as if she had never helped Alima to hold and bind him, sat there in the room, the picture of wisdom and serene strength.  &quot;Sexless, epicene, undeveloped neuters!&quot; he went on bitterly.  He sounded like Sir Almwroth Wright.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Well--it was hard.  He was madly in love with Alima, really; more so than he had ever been before, and their tempestuous courtship, quarrels, and reconciliations had fanned the flame. And then when he sought by that supreme conquest whichseems so natural a thing to that type of man, to force her to love him as her master--to have the sturdy athletic furious woman rise up and master him--she and her friends--it was no wonder he raged.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> Come to think of it, I do not recall a similar case in all history or fiction.  Women have killed themselves rather than submit to outrage; they have killed the outrager; they have escaped; or they have submitted--sometimes seeming to get on very well with the victor afterward.  There was that adventure of &quot;false Sextus,&quot; for instance, who &quot;found Lucrese combing the fleece, under the midnight lamp.&quot;  He threatened, as I remember, that if she did not submit he would slay her, slay a slave and place him beside her and say he found him there.  A poor device, it always seemed to me. If Mr. Lucretius had asked him how he came to be in his wife&#x27;s bedroom overlooking her morals, what could he have said?
