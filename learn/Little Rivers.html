<p>AN ANGLER&#x27;S WISH IN TOWN</p>
<p>When tulips bloom in Union Square,</p>
<p>And timid breaths of vernal air</p>
<p>Are wandering down the dusty town,</p>
<p>Like children lost in Vanity Fair;</p>
<p>When every long, unlovely row</p>
<p>Of westward houses stands aglow</p>
<p>And leads the eyes toward sunset skies,</p>
<p>Beyond the hills where green trees grow;</p>
<p>Then weary is the street parade,</p>
<p>And weary books, and weary trade:</p>
<p>I&#x27;m only wishing to go a-fishing;</p>
<p>For this the month of May was made.</p>
<p>I guess the pussy-willows now</p>
<p>Are creeping out on every bough</p>
<p>Along the brook; and robins look</p>
<p>For early worms behind the plough.</p>
<p>The thistle-birds have changed their dun</p>
<p>For yellow coats to match the sun;</p>
<p>And in the same array of flame</p>
<p>The Dandelion Show&#x27;s begun.</p>
<p>The flocks of young anemones</p>
<p>Are dancing round the budding trees:</p>
<p>Who can help wishing to go a-fishing</p>
<p>In days as full of joy as these?</p>
<p>I think the meadow-lark&#x27;s clear sound</p>
<p>Leaks upward slowly from the ground,</p>
<p>While on the wing the bluebirds ring</p>
<p>Their wedding-bells to woods around:</p>
<p>The flirting chewink calls his dear</p>
<p>Behind the bush; and very near,</p>
<p>Where water flows, where green grass grows,</p>
<p>Song-sparrows gently sing, &quot;Good cheer:&quot;</p>
<p>And, best of all, through twilight&#x27;s calm</p>
<p>The hermit-thrush repeats his psalm:</p>
<p>How much I&#x27;m wishing to go a-fishing</p>
<p>In days so sweet with music&#x27;s balm!</p>
<p>&#x27;Tis not a proud desire of mine;</p>
<p>I ask for nothing superfine;</p>
<p>No heavy weight, no salmon great,</p>
<p>To break the record, or my line:</p>
<p>Only an idle little stream,</p>
<p>Whose amber waters softly gleam,</p>
<p>Where I may wade, through woodland shade,</p>
<p>And cast the fly, and loaf, and dream:</p>
<p>Only a trout or two, to dart</p>
<p>From foaming pools, and try my art:</p>
<p>No more I&#x27;m wishing--old-fashioned fishing,</p>
<p>And just a day on Nature&#x27;s heart.</p>

<p>LITTLE RIVERS</p>
<p>A river is the most human and companionable of all inanimate</p>
<p>things.  It has a life, a character, a voice of its own, and is as</p>
<p>full of good fellowship as a sugar-maple is of sap.  It can talk in</p>
<p>various tones, loud or low, and of many subjects, grave and gay.</p>
<p>Under favourable circumstances it will even make a shift to sing,</p>
<p>not in a fashion that can be reduced to notes and set down in black</p>
<p>and white on a sheet of paper, but in a vague, refreshing manner,</p>
<p>and to a wandering air that goes</p>

<p>For real company and friendship, there is nothing outside of the</p>
<p>animal kingdom that is comparable to a river.</p>
<p>I will admit that a very good case can be made out in favour of</p>
<p>some other objects of natural affection.  For example, a fair</p>
<p>apology has been offered by those ambitious persons who have fallen</p>
<p>in love with the sea.  But, after all, that is a formless and</p>
<p>disquieting passion.  It lacks solid comfort and mutual confidence.</p>
<p>The sea is too big for loving, and too uncertain.  It will not fit</p>
<p>into our thoughts.  It has no personality because it has so many.</p>
<p>It is a salt abstraction.  You might as well think of loving a</p>
<p>glittering generality like &quot;the American woman.&quot;  One would be more</p>
<p>to the purpose.</p>
<p>Mountains are more satisfying because they are more individual.  It</p>
<p>is possible to feel a very strong attachment for a certain range</p>
<p>whose outline has grown familiar to our eyes, or a clear peak that</p>
<p>has looked down, day after day, upon our joys and sorrows,</p>
<p>moderating our passions with its calm aspect.  We come back from</p>
<p>our travels, and the sight of such a well-known mountain is like</p>
<p>meeting an old friend unchanged.  But it is a one-sided affection.</p>
<p>The mountain is voiceless and imperturbable; and its very loftiness</p>
<p>and serenity sometimes make us the more lonely.</p>
<p>Trees seem to come closer to our life.  They are often rooted in</p>
<p>our richest feelings, and our sweetest memories, like birds, build</p>
<p>nests in their branches.  I remember, the last time that I saw</p>
<p>James Russell Lowell, (only a few weeks before his musical voice</p>
<p>was hushed,) he walked out with me into the quiet garden at Elmwood</p>
<p>to say good-bye.  There was a great horse-chestnut tree beside the</p>
<p>house, towering above the gable, and covered with blossoms from</p>
<p>base to summit,--a pyramid of green supporting a thousand smaller</p>
<p>pyramids of white.  The poet looked up at it with his gray, pain-</p>
<p>furrowed face, and laid his trembling hand upon the trunk.  &quot;I</p>
<p>planted the nut,&quot; said he, &quot;from which this tree grew.  And my</p>
<p>father was with me and showed me how to plant it.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, there is a good deal to be said in behalf of tree-worship; and</p>
<p>when I recline with my friend Tityrus beneath the shade of his</p>
<p>favourite oak, I consent in his devotions.  But when I invite him</p>
<p>with me to share my orisons, or wander alone to indulge the luxury</p>
<p>of grateful, unlaborious thought, my feet turn not to a tree, but</p>
<p>to the bank of a river, for there the musings of solitude find a</p>
<p>friendly accompaniment, and human intercourse is purified and</p>
<p>sweetened by the flowing, murmuring water.  It is by a river that I</p>
<p>would choose to make love, and to revive old friendships, and to</p>
<p>play with the children, and to confess my faults, and to escape</p>
<p>from vain, selfish desires, and to cleanse my mind from all the</p>
<p>false and foolish things that mar the joy and peace of living.</p>
<p>Like David&#x27;s hart, I pant for the water-brooks.  There is wisdom in</p>
<p>the advice of Seneca, who says, &quot;Where a spring rises, or a river</p>
<p>flows, there should we build altars and offer sacrifices.&quot;</p>
<p>The personality of a river is not to be found in its water, nor in</p>
<p>its bed, nor in its shore.  Either of these elements, by itself,</p>
<p>would be nothing.  Confine the fluid contents of the noblest stream</p>
<p>in a walled channel of stone, and it ceases to be a stream; it</p>
<p>becomes what Charles Lamb calls &quot;a mockery of a river--a liquid</p>
<p>artifice--a wretched conduit.&quot;  But take away the water from the</p>
<p>most beautiful river-banks, and what is left?  An ugly road with</p>
<p>none to travel it; a long, ghastly scar on the bosom of the earth.</p>
<p>The life of a river, like that of a human being, consists in the</p>
<p>union of soul and body, the water and the banks.  They belong</p>
<p>together.  They act and react upon each other.  The stream moulds</p>
<p>and makes the shore; hollowing out a bay here, and building a long</p>
<p>point there; alluring the little bushes close to its side, and</p>
<p>bending the tall slim trees over its current; sweeping a rocky</p>
<p>ledge clean of everything but moss, and sending a still lagoon full</p>
<p>of white arrow-heads and rosy knot-weed far back into the meadow.</p>
<p>The shore guides and controls the stream; now detaining and now</p>
<p>advancing it; now bending it in a hundred sinuous curves, and now</p>
<p>speeding it straight as a wild-bee on its homeward flight; here</p>
<p>hiding the water in a deep cleft overhung with green branches, and</p>
<p>there spreading it out, like a mirror framed in daisies, to reflect</p>
<p>the sky and the clouds; sometimes breaking it with sudden turns and</p>
<p>unexpected falls into a foam of musical laughter, sometimes</p>
<p>soothing it into a sleepy motion like the flow of a dream.</p>
<p>Is it otherwise with the men and women whom we know and like?  Does</p>
<p>not the spirit influence the form, and the form affect the spirit?</p>
<p>Can we divide and separate them in our affections?</p>
<p>I am no friend to purely psychological attachments.  In some</p>
<p>unknown future they may be satisfying, but in the present I want</p>
<p>your words and your voice with your thoughts, your looks and your</p>
<p>gestures to interpret your feelings.  The warm, strong grasp of</p>
<p>Greatheart&#x27;s hand is as dear to me as the steadfast fashion of his</p>
<p>friendships; the lively, sparkling eyes of the master of Rudder</p>
<p>Grange charm me as much as the nimbleness of his fancy; and the</p>
<p>firm poise of the Hoosier Schoolmaster&#x27;s shaggy head gives me new</p>
<p>confidence in the solidity of his views of life.  I like the pure</p>
<p>tranquillity of Isabel&#x27;s brow as well as her</p>

<p>The soft cadences and turns in my lady Katrina&#x27;s speech draw me</p>
<p>into the humour of her gentle judgments of men and things.  The</p>
<p>touches of quaintness in Angelica&#x27;s dress, her folded kerchief and</p>
<p>smooth-parted hair, seem to partake of herself, and enhance my</p>
<p>admiration for the sweet order of her thoughts and her old-</p>
<p>fashioned ideals of love and duty.  Even so the stream and its</p>
<p>channel are one life, and I cannot think of the swift, brown flood</p>
<p>of the Batiscan without its shadowing primeval forests, or the</p>
<p>crystalline current of the Boquet without its beds of pebbles and</p>
<p>golden sand and grassy banks embroidered with flowers.</p>
<p>Every country--or at least every country that is fit for</p>
<p>habitation--has its own rivers; and every river has its own</p>
<p>quality; and it is the part of wisdom to know and love as many as</p>
<p>you can, seeing each in the fairest possible light, and receiving</p>
<p>from each the best that it has to give.  The torrents of Norway</p>
<p>leap down from their mountain home with plentiful cataracts, and</p>
<p>run brief but glorious races to the sea.  The streams of England</p>
<p>move smoothly through green fields and beside ancient, sleepy</p>
<p>towns.  The Scotch rivers brawl through the open moorland and flash</p>
<p>along steep Highland glens.  The rivers of the Alps are born in icy</p>
<p>caves, from which they issue forth with furious, turbid waters; but</p>
<p>when their anger has been forgotten in the slumber of some blue</p>
<p>lake, they flow down more softly to see the vineyards of France and</p>
<p>Italy, the gray castles of Germany, the verdant meadows of Holland.</p>
<p>The mighty rivers of the West roll their yellow floods through</p>
<p>broad valleys, or plunge down dark canyons.  The rivers of the</p>
<p>South creep under dim arboreal archways hung with banners of waving</p>
<p>moss.  The Delaware and the Hudson and the Connecticut are the</p>
<p>children of the Catskills and the Adirondacks and the White</p>
<p>Mountains, cradled among the forests of spruce and hemlock, playing</p>
<p>through a wild woodland youth, gathering strength from numberless</p>
<p>tributaries to bear their great burdens of lumber and turn the</p>
<p>wheels of many mills, issuing from the hills to water a thousand</p>
<p>farms, and descending at last, beside new cities, to the ancient</p>
<p>sea.</p>
<p>Every river that flows is good, and has something worthy to be</p>
<p>loved.  But those that we love most are always the ones that we</p>
<p>have known best,--the stream that ran before our father&#x27;s door, the</p>
<p>current on which we ventured our first boat or cast our first fly,</p>
<p>the brook on whose banks we first picked the twinflower of young</p>
<p>love.  However far we may travel, we come back to Naaman&#x27;s state of</p>
<p>mind: &quot;Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than</p>
<p>all the waters of Israel?&quot;</p>
<p>It is with rivers as it is with people: the greatest are not always</p>
<p>the most agreeable, nor the best to live with.  Diogenes must have</p>
<p>been an uncomfortable bedfellow: Antinous was bored to death in the</p>
<p>society of the Emperor Hadrian: and you can imagine much better</p>
<p>company for a walking trip than Napoleon Bonaparte.  Semiramis was</p>
<p>a lofty queen, but I fancy that Ninus had more than one bad</p>
<p>quarter-of-an-hour with her: and in &quot;the spacious times of great</p>
<p>Elizabeth&quot; there was many a milkmaid whom the wise man would have</p>
<p>chosen for his friend, before the royal red-haired virgin.  &quot;I</p>
<p>confess,&quot; says the poet Cowley, &quot;I love littleness almost in all</p>
<p>things.  A little convenient Estate, a little chearful House, a</p>
<p>little Company, and a very little Feast, and if I were ever to fall</p>
<p>in Love again, (which is a great Passion, and therefore, I hope, I</p>
<p>have done with it,) it would be, I think, with Prettiness, rather</p>
<p>than with Majestical Beauty.  I would neither wish that my</p>
<p>Mistress, nor my Fortune, should be a Bona Roba, as Homer uses to</p>
<p>describe his Beauties, like a daughter of great Jupiter for the</p>
<p>stateliness and largeness of her Person, but as Lucretius says:</p>

<p>Now in talking about women it is prudent to disguise a prejudice</p>
<p>like this, in the security of a dead language, and to intrench it</p>
<p>behind a fortress of reputable authority.  But in lowlier and less</p>
<p>dangerous matters, such as we are now concerned with, one may dare</p>
<p>to speak in plain English.  I am all for the little rivers.  Let</p>
<p>those who will, chant in heroic verse the renown of Amazon and</p>
<p>Mississippi and Niagara, but my prose shall flow--or straggle along</p>
<p>at such a pace as the prosaic muse may grant me to attain--in</p>
<p>praise of Beaverkill and Neversink and Swiftwater, of Saranac and</p>
<p>Raquette and Ausable, of Allegash and Aroostook and Moose River.</p>
<p>&quot;Whene&#x27;er I take my walks abroad,&quot; it shall be to trace the clear</p>
<p>Rauma from its rise on the fjeld to its rest in the fjord; or to</p>
<p>follow the Ericht and the Halladale through the heather.  The</p>
<p>Ziller and the Salzach shall be my guides through the Tyrol; the</p>
<p>Rotha and the Dove shall lead me into the heart of England.  My</p>
<p>sacrificial flames shall be kindled with birch-bark along the</p>
<p>wooded stillwaters of the Penobscot and the Peribonca, and my</p>
<p>libations drawn from the pure current of the Ristigouche and the</p>
<p>Ampersand, and my altar of remembrance shall rise upon the rocks</p>
<p>beside the falls of Seboomok.</p>
<p>I will set my affections upon rivers that are not too great for</p>
<p>intimacy.  And if by chance any of these little ones have also</p>
<p>become famous, like the Tweed and the Thames and the Arno, I at</p>
<p>least will praise them, because they are still at heart little</p>
<p>rivers.</p>
<p>If an open fire is, as Charles Dudley Warner says, the eye of a</p>
<p>room; then surely a little river may be called the mouth, the most</p>
<p>expressive feature, of a landscape.  It animates and enlivens the</p>
<p>whole scene.  Even a railway journey becomes tolerable when the</p>
<p>track follows the course of a running stream.</p>
<p>What charming glimpses you catch from the window as the train winds</p>
<p>along the valley of the French Broad from Asheville, or climbs the</p>
<p>southern Catskills beside the Aesopus, or slides down the</p>
<p>Pusterthal with the Rienz, or follows the Glommen and the Gula from</p>
<p>Christiania to Throndhjem.  Here is a mill with its dripping, lazy</p>
<p>wheel, the type of somnolent industry; and there is a white</p>
<p>cascade, foaming in silent pantomime as the train clatters by; and</p>
<p>here is a long, still pool with the cows standing knee-deep in the</p>
<p>water and swinging their tails in calm indifference to the passing</p>
<p>world; and there is a lone fisherman sitting upon a rock, rapt in</p>
<p>contemplation of the point of his rod.  For a moment you become a</p>
<p>partner of his tranquil enterprise.  You turn around, you crane</p>
<p>your neck to get the last sight of his motionless angle.  You do</p>
<p>not know what kind of fish he expects to catch, nor what species of</p>
<p>bait he is using, but at least you pray that he may have a bite</p>
<p>before the train swings around the next curve.  And if perchance</p>
<p>your wish is granted, and you see him gravely draw some unknown,</p>
<p>reluctant, shining reward of patience from the water, you feel like</p>
<p>swinging your hat from the window and crying out &quot;Good luck!&quot;</p>
<p>Little rivers seem to have the indefinable quality that belongs to</p>
<p>certain people in the world,--the power of drawing attention</p>
<p>without courting it, the faculty of exciting interest by their very</p>
<p>presence and way of doing things.</p>
<p>The most fascinating part of a city or town is that through which</p>
<p>the water flows.  Idlers always choose a bridge for their place of</p>
<p>meditation when they can get it; and, failing that, you will find</p>
<p>them sitting on the edge of a quay or embankment, with their feet</p>
<p>hanging over the water.  What a piquant mingling of indolence and</p>
<p>vivacity you can enjoy by the river-side!  The best point of view</p>
<p>in Rome, to my taste, is the Ponte San Angelo; and in Florence or</p>
<p>Pisa I never tire of loafing along the Lung&#x27; Arno.  You do not know</p>
<p>London until you have seen it from the Thames.  And you will miss</p>
<p>the charm of Cambridge unless you take a little boat and go</p>
<p>drifting on the placid Cam, beneath the bending trees, along the</p>
<p>backs of the colleges.</p>
<p>But the real way to know a little river is not to glance at it here</p>
<p>or there in the course of a hasty journey, nor to become acquainted</p>
<p>with it after it has been partly civilised and spoiled by too close</p>
<p>contact with the works of man.  You must go to its native haunts;</p>
<p>you must see it in youth and freedom; you must accommodate yourself</p>
<p>to its pace, and give yourself to its influence, and follow its</p>
<p>meanderings whithersoever they may lead you.</p>
<p>Now, of this pleasant pastime there are three principal forms.  You</p>
<p>may go as a walker, taking the river-side path, or making a way for</p>
<p>yourself through the tangled thickets or across the open meadows.</p>
<p>You may go as a sailor, launching your light canoe on the swift</p>
<p>current and committing yourself for a day, or a week, or a month,</p>
<p>to the delightful uncertainties of a voyage through the forest.</p>
<p>You may go as a wader, stepping into the stream and going down with</p>
<p>it, through rapids and shallows and deeper pools, until you come to</p>
<p>the end of your courage and the daylight.  Of these three ways I</p>
<p>know not which is best.  But in all of them the essential thing is</p>
<p>that you must be willing and glad to be led; you must take the</p>
<p>little river for your guide, philosopher, and friend.</p>
<p>And what a good guidance it gives you.  How cheerfully it lures you</p>
<p>on into the secrets of field and wood, and brings you acquainted</p>
<p>with the birds and the flowers.  The stream can show you, better</p>
<p>than any other teacher, how nature works her enchantments with</p>
<p>colour and music.</p>
<p>Go out to the Beaver-kill</p>

<p>and follow its brimming waters through the budding forests, to that</p>
<p>corner which we call the Painter&#x27;s Camp.  See how the banks are all</p>
<p>enamelled with the pale hepatica, the painted trillium, and the</p>
<p>delicate pink-veined spring beauty.  A little later in the year,</p>
<p>when the ferns are uncurling their long fronds, the troops of blue</p>
<p>and white violets will come dancing down to the edge of the stream,</p>
<p>and creep venturously out to the very end of that long, moss-</p>
<p>covered log in the water.  Before these have vanished, the yellow</p>
<p>crow-foot and the cinquefoil will appear, followed by the star-</p>
<p>grass and the loose-strife and the golden St. John&#x27;s-wort.  Then</p>
<p>the unseen painter begins to mix the royal colour on his palette,</p>
<p>and the red of the bee-balm catches your eye.  If you are lucky,</p>
<p>you may find, in midsummer, a slender fragrant spike of the purple-</p>
<p>fringed orchis, and you cannot help finding the universal self-</p>
<p>heal.  Yellow returns in the drooping flowers of the jewel-weed,</p>
<p>and blue repeats itself in the trembling hare-bells, and scarlet is</p>
<p>glorified in the flaming robe of the cardinal-flower.  Later still,</p>
<p>the summer closes in a splendour of bloom, with gentians and asters</p>
<p>and goldenrod.</p>
<p>You never get so close to the birds as when you are wading quietly</p>
<p>down a little river, casting your fly deftly under the branches for</p>
<p>the wary trout, but ever on the lookout for all the various</p>
<p>pleasant things that nature has to bestow upon you.  Here you shall</p>
<p>come upon the cat-bird at her morning bath, and hear her sing, in a</p>
<p>clump of pussy-willows, that low, tender, confidential song which</p>
<p>she keeps for the hours of domestic intimacy.  The spotted</p>
<p>sandpiper will run along the stones before you, crying, &quot;wet-feet,</p>
<p>wet-feet!&quot; and bowing and teetering in the friendliest manner, as</p>
<p>if to show you the way to the best pools.  In the thick branches of</p>
<p>the hemlocks that stretch across the stream, the tiny warblers,</p>
<p>dressed in a hundred colours, chirp and twitter confidingly above</p>
<p>your head; and the Maryland yellow-throat, flitting through the</p>
<p>bushes like a little gleam of sunlight, calls &quot;witchery, witchery,</p>
<p>witchery!&quot;  That plaintive, forsaken, persistent note, never</p>
<p>ceasing, even in the noonday silence, comes from the wood-pewee,</p>
<p>drooping upon the bough of some high tree, and complaining, like</p>
<p>Mariana in the moated grange, &quot;weary, weary, weary!&quot;</p>
<p>When the stream runs out into the old clearing, or down through the</p>
<p>pasture, you find other and livelier birds,--the robins, with his</p>
<p>sharp, saucy call and breathless, merry warble; the bluebird, with</p>
<p>his notes of pure gladness, and the oriole, with his wild, flexible</p>
<p>whistle; the chewink, bustling about in the thicket, talking to his</p>
<p>sweetheart in French, &quot;cherie, cherie!&quot; and the song-sparrow,</p>
<p>perched on his favourite limb of a young maple, dose beside the</p>
<p>water, and singing happily, through sunshine and through rain.</p>
<p>This is the true bird of the brook, after all: the winged spirit of</p>
<p>cheerfulness and contentment, the patron saint of little rivers,</p>
<p>the fisherman&#x27;s friend.  He seems to enter into your sport with his</p>
<p>good wishes, and for an hour at a time, while you are trying every</p>
<p>fly in your book, from a black gnat to a white miller, to entice</p>
<p>the crafty old trout at the foot of the meadow-pool, the song-</p>
<p>sparrow, close above you, will be chanting patience and</p>
<p>encouragement.  And when at last success crowns your endeavour, and</p>
<p>the parti-coloured prize is glittering in your net, the bird on the</p>
<p>bough breaks out in an ecstasy of congratulation: &quot;catch &#x27;im, catch</p>
<p>&#x27;im, catch &#x27;im; oh, what a pretty fellow! sweet!&quot;</p>
<p>There are other birds that seem to have a very different temper.</p>
<p>The blue-jay sits high up in the withered-pine tree, bobbing up and</p>
<p>down, and calling to his mate in a tone of affected sweetness.</p>
<p>&quot;salute-her, salute-her,&quot; but when you come in sight he flies away</p>
<p>with a harsh cry of &quot;thief, thief, thief!&quot;  The kingfisher,</p>
<p>ruffling his crest in solitary pride on the end of a dead branch,</p>
<p>darts down the stream at your approach, winding up his red angrily</p>
<p>as if he despised you for interrupting his fishing.  And the cat-</p>
<p>bird, that sang so charmingly while she thought herself unobserved,</p>
<p>now tries to scare you away by screaming &quot;snake, snake!&quot;</p>
<p>As evening draws near, and the light beneath the trees grows</p>
<p>yellower, and the air is full of filmy insects out for their last</p>
<p>dance, the voice of the little river becomes louder and more</p>
<p>distinct.  The true poets have often noticed this apparent increase</p>
<p>in the sound of flowing waters at nightfall.  Gray, in one of his</p>
<p>letters, speaks of &quot;hearing the murmur of many waters not audible</p>
<p>in the daytime.&quot;  Wordsworth repeats the same thought almost in the</p>
<p>same words:</p>

<p>It is in this mystical hour that you will hear the most celestial</p>
<p>and entrancing of all bird-notes, the songs of the thrushes,--the</p>
<p>hermit, and the wood-thrush, and the veery.  Sometimes, but not</p>
<p>often, you will see the singers.  I remember once, at the close of</p>
<p>a beautiful day&#x27;s fishing on the Swiftwater, I came out, just after</p>
<p>sunset, into a little open space in an elbow of the stream.  It was</p>
<p>still early spring, and the leaves were tiny.  On the top of a</p>
<p>small sumac, not thirty feet away from me, sat a veery.  I could</p>
<p>see the pointed spots upon his breast, the swelling of his white</p>
<p>throat, and the sparkle of his eyes, as he poured his whole heart</p>
<p>into a long liquid chant, the clear notes rising and falling,</p>
<p>echoing and interlacing in endless curves of sound,</p>

<p>But it is not only to the real life of birds and flowers that the</p>
<p>little rivers introduce you.  They lead you often into familiarity</p>
<p>with human nature in undress, rejoicing in the liberty of old</p>
<p>clothes, or of none at all.  People do not mince along the banks of</p>
<p>streams in patent-leather shoes or crepitating silks.  Corduroy and</p>
<p>home-spun and flannel are the stuffs that suit this region; and the</p>
<p>frequenters of these paths go their natural gaits, in calf-skin or</p>
<p>rubber boots, or bare-footed.  The girdle of conventionality is</p>
<p>laid aside, and the skirts rise with the spirits.</p>
<p>A stream that flows through a country of upland farms will show you</p>
<p>many a pretty bit of genre painting.  Here is the laundry-pool at</p>
<p>the foot of the kitchen garden, and the tubs are set upon a few</p>
<p>planks close to the water, and the farmer&#x27;s daughters, with bare</p>
<p>arms and gowns tucked up, are wringing out the clothes.  Do you</p>
<p>remember what happened to Ralph Peden in The Lilac Sunbonnet when</p>
<p>he came on a scene like this?  He tumbled at once into love with</p>
<p>Winsome Charteris,--and far over his head.</p>
<p>And what a pleasant thing it is to see a little country lad riding</p>
<p>one of the plough-horses to water, thumping his naked heels against</p>
<p>the ribs of his stolid steed, and pulling hard on the halter as if</p>
<p>it were the bridle of Bucephalus!  Or perhaps it is a riotous</p>
<p>company of boys that have come down to the old swimming-hole, and</p>
<p>are now splashing and gambolling through the water like a drove of</p>
<p>white seals very much sun-burned.  You had hoped to catch a goodly</p>
<p>trout in that hole, but what of that?  The sight of a harmless hour</p>
<p>of mirth is better than a fish, any day.</p>
<p>Possibly you will overtake another fisherman on the stream.  It may</p>
<p>be one of those fabulous countrymen, with long cedar poles and bed-</p>
<p>cord lines, who are commonly reported to catch such enormous</p>
<p>strings of fish, but who rarely, so far as my observation goes, do</p>
<p>anything more than fill their pockets with fingerlings.  The</p>
<p>trained angler, who uses the finest tackle, and drops his fly on</p>
<p>the water as accurately as Henry James places a word in a story, is</p>
<p>the man who takes the most and the largest fish in the long run.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fisherman ahead of you is such an one,--a man whom you</p>
<p>have known in town as a lawyer or a doctor, a merchant or a</p>
<p>preacher, going about his business in the hideous respectability of</p>
<p>a high silk hat and a long black coat.  How good it is to see him</p>
<p>now in the freedom of a flannel shirt and a broad-brimmed gray felt</p>
<p>with flies stuck around the band.</p>
<p>In Professor John Wilson&#x27;s Essays Critical and Imaginative, there</p>
<p>is a brilliant description of a bishop fishing, which I am sure is</p>
<p>drawn from the life: &quot;Thus a bishop, sans wig and petticoat, in a</p>
<p>hairy cap, black jacket, corduroy breeches and leathern leggins,</p>
<p>creel on back and rod in hand, sallying from his palace, impatient</p>
<p>to reach a famous salmon-cast ere the sun leave his cloud, . . .</p>
<p>appears not only a pillar of his church, but of his kind, and in</p>
<p>such a costume is manifestly on the high road to Canterbury and the</p>
<p>Kingdom-Come.&quot;  I have had the good luck to see quite a number of</p>
<p>bishops, parochial and diocesan, in that style, and the vision has</p>
<p>always dissolved my doubts in regard to the validity of their claim</p>
<p>to the true apostolic succession.</p>
<p>Men&#x27;s &quot;little ways&quot; are usually more interesting, and often more</p>
<p>instructive than their grand manners.  When they are off guard,</p>
<p>they frequently show to better advantage than when they are on</p>
<p>parade.  I get more pleasure out of Boswell&#x27;s Johnson than I do out</p>
<p>of Rasselas or The Rambler.  The Little Flowers of St. Francis</p>
<p>appear to me far more precious than the most learned German and</p>
<p>French analyses of his character.  There is a passage in Jonathan</p>
<p>Edwards&#x27; Personal Narrative, about a certain walk that he took in</p>
<p>the fields near his father&#x27;s house, and the blossoming of the</p>
<p>flowers in the spring, which I would not exchange for the whole of</p>
<p>his dissertation On the Freedom of the Will.  And the very best</p>
<p>thing of Charles Darwin&#x27;s that I know is a bit from a letter to his</p>
<p>wife: &quot;At last I fell asleep,&quot; says he, &quot;on the grass, and awoke</p>
<p>with a chorus of birds singing around me, and squirrels running up</p>
<p>the tree, and some woodpeckers laughing; and it was as pleasant and</p>
<p>rural a scene as ever I saw; and I did not care one penny how any</p>
<p>of the birds or beasts had been formed.&quot;</p>
<p>Little rivers have small responsibilities.  They are not expected</p>
<p>to bear huge navies on their breast or supply a hundred-thousand</p>
<p>horse-power to the factories of a monstrous town.  Neither do you</p>
<p>come to them hoping to draw out Leviathan with a hook.  It is</p>
<p>enough if they run a harmless, amiable course, and keep the groves</p>
<p>and fields green and fresh along their banks, and offer a happy</p>
<p>alternation of nimble rapids and quiet pools,</p>

<p>When you set out to explore one of these minor streams in your</p>
<p>canoe, you have no intention of epoch-making discoveries, or</p>
<p>thrilling and world-famous adventures.  You float placidly down the</p>
<p>long stillwaters, and make your way patiently through the tangle of</p>
<p>fallen trees that block the stream, and run the smaller falls, and</p>
<p>carry your boat around the larger ones, with no loftier ambition</p>
<p>than to reach a good camp-ground before dark and to pass the</p>
<p>intervening hours pleasantly, &quot;without offence to God or man.&quot;  It</p>
<p>is an agreeable and advantageous frame of mind for one who has done</p>
<p>his fair share of work in the world, and is not inclined to grumble</p>
<p>at his wages.  There are few moods in which we are more susceptible</p>
<p>of gentle instruction; and I suspect there are many tempers and</p>
<p>attitudes, often called virtuous, in which the human spirit appears</p>
<p>to less advantage in the sight of Heaven.</p>
<p>It is not required of every man and woman to be, or to do,</p>
<p>something great; most of us must content ourselves with taking</p>
<p>small parts in the chorus.  Shall we have no little lyrics because</p>
<p>Homer and Dante have written epics?  And because we have heard the</p>
<p>great organ at Freiburg, shall the sound of Kathi&#x27;s zither in the</p>
<p>alpine hut please us no more?  Even those who have greatness thrust</p>
<p>upon them will do well to lay the burden down now and then, and</p>
<p>congratulate themselves that they are not altogether answerable for</p>
<p>the conduct of the universe, or at least not all the time.  &quot;I</p>
<p>reckon,&quot; said a cowboy to me one day, as we were riding through the</p>
<p>Bad Lands of Dakota, &quot;there&#x27;s some one bigger than me, running this</p>
<p>outfit.  He can &#x27;tend to it well enough, while I smoke my pipe</p>
<p>after the round-up.&quot;</p>
<p>There is such a thing as taking ourselves and the world too</p>
<p>seriously, or at any rate too anxiously.  Half of the secular</p>
<p>unrest and dismal, profane sadness of modern society comes from the</p>
<p>vain idea that every man is bound to be a critic of life, and to</p>
<p>let no day pass without finding some fault with the general order</p>
<p>of things, or projecting some plan for its improvement.  And the</p>
<p>other half comes from the greedy notion that a man&#x27;s life does</p>
<p>consist, after all, in the abundance of the things that he</p>
<p>possesses, and that it is somehow or other more respectable and</p>
<p>pious to be always at work making a larger living, than it is to</p>
<p>lie on your back in the green pastures and beside the still waters,</p>
<p>and thank God that you are alive.</p>
<p>Come, then, my gentle reader, (for by this time you have discovered</p>
<p>that this chapter is only a preface in disguise,--a declaration of</p>
<p>principles or the want of them, an apology or a defence, as you</p>
<p>choose to take it,) and if we are agreed, let us walk together; but</p>
<p>if not, let us part here with out ill-will.</p>
<p>You shall not be deceived in this book.  It is nothing but a</p>
<p>handful of rustic variations on the old tune of &quot;Rest and be</p>
<p>thankful,&quot; a record of unconventional travel, a pilgrim&#x27;s scrip</p>
<p>with a few bits of blue-sky philosophy in it.  There is, so far as</p>
<p>I know, very little useful information and absolutely no criticism</p>
<p>of the universe to be found in this volume.  So if you are what</p>
<p>Izaak Walton calls &quot;a severe, sour-complexioned man,&quot; you would</p>
<p>better carry it back to the bookseller, and get your money again,</p>
<p>if he will give it to you, and go your way rejoicing after your own</p>
<p>melancholy fashion.</p>
<p>But if you care for plain pleasures, and informal company, and</p>
<p>friendly observations on men and things, (and a few true fish-</p>
<p>stories,) then perhaps you may find something here not unworthy</p>
<p>your perusal.  And so I wish that your winter fire may burn clear</p>
<p>and bright while you read these pages; and that the summer days may</p>
<p>be fair, and the fish may rise merrily to your fly, whenever you</p>
<p>follow one of these little rivers.</p>

<p>A LEAF OF SPEARMINT</p>
<p>RECOLLECTIONS OF A BOY AND A ROD.</p>
<p>&quot;It puzzles me now, that I remember all these young impressions so,</p>
<p>because I took no heed of them at the time whatever; and yet they</p>
<p>come upon me bright, when nothing else is evident in the gray fog</p>
<p>of experience.&quot;--B. D. BLACKMORE: Lorna Doone.</p>
<p>Of all the faculties of the human mind, memory is the one that is</p>
<p>most easily &quot;led by the nose.&quot;  There is a secret power in the</p>
<p>sense of smell which draws the mind backward into the pleasant land</p>
<p>of old times.</p>
<p>If you could paint a picture of Memory, in the symbolical manner of</p>
<p>Quarles&#x27;s Emblems, it should represent a man travelling the highway</p>
<p>with a dusty pack upon his shoulders, and stooping to draw in a</p>
<p>long, sweet breath from the small, deep-red, golden-hearted flowers</p>
<p>of an old-fashioned rose-tree straggling through the fence of a</p>
<p>neglected garden.  Or perhaps, for a choice of emblems, you would</p>
<p>better take a yet more homely and familiar scent: the cool</p>
<p>fragrance of lilacs drifting through the June morning from the old</p>
<p>bush that stands between the kitchen door and the well; the warm</p>
<p>layer of pungent, aromatic air that floats over the tansy-bed in a</p>
<p>still July noon; the drowsy dew of odour that falls from the big</p>
<p>balm-of-Gilead tree by the roadside as you are driving homeward</p>
<p>through the twilight of August; or, best of all, the clean, spicy,</p>
<p>unexpected, unmistakable smell of a bed of spearmint--that is the</p>
<p>bed whereon Memory loves to lie and dream!</p>
<p>Why not choose mint as the symbol of remembrance?  It is the true</p>
<p>spice-tree of our Northern clime, the myrrh and frankincense of the</p>
<p>land of lingering snow.  When its perfume rises, the shrines of the</p>
<p>past are unveiled, and the magical rites of reminiscence begin.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>You are fishing down the Swiftwater in the early Spring.  In a</p>
<p>shallow pool, which the drought of summer will soon change into dry</p>
<p>land, you see the pale-green shoots of a little plant thrusting</p>
<p>themselves up between the pebbles, and just beginning to overtop</p>
<p>the falling water.  You pluck a leaf of it as you turn out of the</p>
<p>stream to find a comfortable place for lunch, and, rolling it</p>
<p>between your fingers to see whether it smells like a good salad for</p>
<p>your bread and cheese, you discover suddenly that it is new mint.</p>
<p>For the rest of that day you are bewitched; you follow a stream</p>
<p>that runs through the country of Auld Lang Syne, and fill your</p>
<p>creel with the recollections of a boy and a rod.</p>
<p>And yet, strangely enough, you cannot recall the boy himself at all</p>
<p>distinctly.  There is only the faintest image of him on the endless</p>
<p>roll of films that has been wound through your mental camera: and</p>
<p>in the very spots where his small figure should appear, it seems as</p>
<p>if the pictures were always light-struck.  Just a blur, and the dim</p>
<p>outline of a new cap, or a well-beloved jacket with extra pockets,</p>
<p>or a much-hated pair of copper-toed shoes--that is all you can see.</p>
<p>But the people that the boy saw, the companions who helped or</p>
<p>hindered him in his adventures, the sublime and marvellous scenes</p>
<p>among the Catskills and the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains, in</p>
<p>the midst of which he lived and moved and had his summer holidays--</p>
<p>all these stand out sharp and clear, as the &quot;Bab Ballads&quot; say,</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&quot;Photographically lined</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> On the tablets of your mind.&quot;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>And most vivid do these scenes and people become when the vague and</p>
<p>irrecoverable boy who walks among them carries a rod over his</p>
<p>shoulder, and you detect the soft bulginess of wet fish about his</p>
<p>clothing, and perhaps the tail of a big one emerging from his</p>
<p>pocket.  Then it seems almost as if these were things that had</p>
<p>really happened, and of which you yourself were a great part.</p>
<p>The rod was a reward, yet not exactly of merit.  It was an</p>
<p>instrument of education in the hand of a father less indiscriminate</p>
<p>than Solomon, who chose to interpret the text in a new way, and</p>
<p>preferred to educate his child by encouraging him in pursuits which</p>
<p>were harmless and wholesome, rather than by chastising him for</p>
<p>practices which would likely enough never have been thought of, if</p>
<p>they had not been forbidden.  The boy enjoyed this kind of father</p>
<p>at the time, and later he came to understand, with a grateful</p>
<p>heart, that there is no richer inheritance in all the treasury of</p>
<p>unearned blessings.  For, after all, the love, the patience, the</p>
<p>kindly wisdom of a grown man who can enter into the perplexities</p>
<p>and turbulent impulses of a boy&#x27;s heart, and give him cheerful</p>
<p>companionship, and lead him on by free and joyful ways to know and</p>
<p>choose the things that are pure and lovely and of good report, make</p>
<p>as fair an image as we can find of that loving, patient Wisdom</p>
<p>which must be above us all if any good is to come out of our</p>
<p>childish race.</p>
<p>Now this was the way in which the boy came into possession of his</p>
<p>undreaded rod.  He was by nature and heredity one of those</p>
<p>predestined anglers whom Izaak Walton tersely describes as &quot;born</p>
<p>so.&quot;  His earliest passion was fishing.  His favourite passage in</p>
<p>Holy Writ was that place where Simon Peter throws a line into the</p>
<p>sea and pulls out a great fish at the first cast.</p>
<p>But hitherto his passion had been indulged under difficulties--with</p>
<p>improvised apparatus of cut poles, and flabby pieces of string, and</p>
<p>bent pins, which always failed to hold the biggest fish; or perhaps</p>
<p>with borrowed tackle, dangling a fat worm in vain before the noses</p>
<p>of the staring, supercilious sunfish that poised themselves in the</p>
<p>clear water around the Lake house dock at Lake George; or, at best,</p>
<p>on picnic parties across the lake, marred by the humiliating</p>
<p>presence of nurses, and disturbed by the obstinate refusal of old</p>
<p>Horace, the boatman, to believe that the boy could bait his own</p>
<p>hook, but sometimes crowned with the delight of bringing home a</p>
<p>whole basketful of yellow perch and goggle-eyes.  Of nobler sport</p>
<p>with game fish, like the vaulting salmon and the merry, pugnacious</p>
<p>trout, as yet the boy had only dreamed.  But he had heard that</p>
<p>there were such fish in the streams that flowed down from the</p>
<p>mountains around Lake George, and he was at the happy age when he</p>
<p>could believe anything--if it was sufficiently interesting.</p>
<p>There was one little river, and only one, within his knowledge and</p>
<p>the reach of his short legs.  It was a tiny, lively rivulet that</p>
<p>came out of the woods about half a mile away from the hotel, and</p>
<p>ran down cater-cornered through a sloping meadow, crossing the road</p>
<p>under a flat bridge of boards, just beyond the root-beer shop at</p>
<p>the lower end of the village.  It seemed large enough to the boy,</p>
<p>and he had long had his eye upon it as a fitting theatre for the</p>
<p>beginning of a real angler&#x27;s life.  Those rapids, those falls,</p>
<p>those deep, whirling pools with beautiful foam on them like soft,</p>
<p>white custard, were they not such places as the trout loved to hide</p>
<p>in?</p>
<p>You can see the long hotel piazza, with the gossipy groups of</p>
<p>wooden chairs standing vacant in the early afternoon; for the</p>
<p>grown-up people are dallying with the ultimate nuts and raisins of</p>
<p>their mid-day dinner.  A villainous clatter of innumerable little</p>
<p>vegetable-dishes comes from the open windows of the pantry as the</p>
<p>boy steals past the kitchen end of the house, with Horace&#x27;s</p>
<p>lightest bamboo pole over his shoulder, and a little brother in</p>
<p>skirts and short white stockings tagging along behind him.</p>
<p>When they come to the five-rail fence where the brook runs out of</p>
<p>the field, the question is, Over or under?  The lowlier method</p>
<p>seems safer for the little brother, as well as less conspicuous for</p>
<p>persons who desire to avoid publicity until their enterprise has</p>
<p>achieved success.  So they crawl beneath a bend in the lowest</p>
<p>rail,--only tearing one tiny three-cornered hole in a jacket, and</p>
<p>making some juicy green stains on the white stockings,--and emerge</p>
<p>with suppressed excitement in the field of the cloth of buttercups</p>
<p>and daisies.</p>
<p>What an afternoon--how endless and yet how swift!  What perilous</p>
<p>efforts to leap across the foaming stream at its narrowest points;</p>
<p>what escapes from quagmires and possible quicksands; what stealthy</p>
<p>creeping through the grass to the edge of a likely pool, and</p>
<p>cautious dropping of the line into an unseen depth, and patient</p>
<p>waiting for a bite, until the restless little brother, prowling</p>
<p>about below, discovers that the hook is not in the water at all,</p>
<p>but lying on top of a dry stone,--thereby proving that patience is</p>
<p>not the only virtue--or, at least, that it does a better business</p>
<p>when it has a small vice of impatience in partnership with it!</p>
<p>How tired the adventurers grow as the day wears away; and as yet</p>
<p>they have taken nothing!  But their strength and courage return as</p>
<p>if by magic when there comes a surprising twitch at the line in a</p>
<p>shallow, unpromising rapid, and with a jerk of the pole a small,</p>
<p>wiggling fish is whirled through the air and landed thirty feet</p>
<p>back in the meadow.</p>
<p>&quot;For pity&#x27;s sake, don&#x27;t lose him!  There he is among the roots of</p>
<p>the blue flag.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve got him!  How cold he is--how slippery--how pretty!  Just</p>
<p>like a piece of rainbow!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you see the red spots?  Did you notice how gamy he was, little</p>
<p>brother; how he played?  It is a trout, for sure; a real trout,</p>
<p>almost as long as your hand.&quot;</p>
<p>So the two lads tramp along up the stream, chattering as if there</p>
<p>were no rubric of silence in the angler&#x27;s code.  Presently another</p>
<p>simple-minded troutling falls a victim to their unpremeditated art;</p>
<p>and they begin already, being human, to wish for something larger.</p>
<p>In the very last pool that they dare attempt--a dark hole under a</p>
<p>steep bank, where the brook issues from the woods--the boy drags</p>
<p>out the hoped-for prize, a splendid trout, longer than a new lead-</p>
<p>pencil.  But he feels sure that there must be another, even larger,</p>
<p>in the same place.  He swings his line out carefully over the</p>
<p>water, and just as he is about to drop it in, the little brother,</p>
<p>perched on the sloping brink, slips on the smooth pine-needles, and</p>
<p>goes sliddering down into the pool up to his waist.  How he weeps</p>
<p>with dismay, and how funnily his dress sticks to him as he crawls</p>
<p>out!  But his grief is soon assuaged by the privilege of carrying</p>
<p>the trout strung on an alder twig; and it is a happy, muddy, proud</p>
<p>pair of urchins that climb over the fence out of the field of</p>
<p>triumph at the close of the day.</p>
<p>What does the father say, as he meets them in the road?  Is he</p>
<p>frowning or smiling under that big brown beard?  You cannot be</p>
<p>quite sure.  But one thing is clear: he is as much elated over the</p>
<p>capture of the real trout as any one.  He is ready to deal mildly</p>
<p>with a little irregularity for the sake of encouraging pluck and</p>
<p>perseverance.  Before the three comrades have reached the hotel,</p>
<p>the boy has promised faithfully never to take his little brother</p>
<p>off again without asking leave; and the father has promised that</p>
<p>the boy shall have a real jointed fishing-rod of his own, so that</p>
<p>he will not need to borrow old Horace&#x27;s pole any more.</p>
<p>At breakfast the next morning the family are to have a private</p>
<p>dish; not an every-day affair of vulgar, bony fish that nurses can</p>
<p>catch, but trout--three of them!  But the boy looks up from the</p>
<p>table and sees the adored of his soul, Annie V----, sitting at the</p>
<p>other end of the room, and faring on the common food of mortals.</p>
<p>Shall she eat the ordinary breakfast while he feasts on dainties?</p>
<p>Do not other sportsmen send their spoils to the ladies whom they</p>
<p>admire?  The waiter must bring a hot plate, and take this largest</p>
<p>trout to Miss V---- (Miss Annie, not her sister--make no mistake</p>
<p>about it).</p>
<p>The face of Augustus is as solemn as an ebony idol while he plays</p>
<p>his part of Cupid&#x27;s messenger.  The fair Annie affects surprise;</p>
<p>she accepts the offering rather indifferently; her curls drop down</p>
<p>over her cheeks to cover some small confusion.  But for an instant</p>
<p>the corner of her eye catches the boy&#x27;s sidelong glance, and she</p>
<p>nods perceptibly, whereupon his mother very inconsiderately calls</p>
<p>attention to the fact that yesterday&#x27;s escapade has sun-burned his</p>
<p>face dreadfully.</p>
<p>Beautiful Annie V----, who, among all the unripened nymphs that</p>
<p>played at hide-and-seek among the maples on the hotel lawn, or</p>
<p>waded with white feet along the yellow beach beyond the point of</p>
<p>pines, flying with merry shrieks into the woods when a boat-load of</p>
<p>boys appeared suddenly around the corner, or danced the lancers in</p>
<p>the big, bare parlours before the grown-up ball began--who in all</p>
<p>that joyous, innocent bevy could be compared with you for charm or</p>
<p>daring?  How your dark eyes sparkled, and how the long brown</p>
<p>ringlets tossed around your small head, when you stood up that</p>
<p>evening, slim and straight, and taller by half a head than your</p>
<p>companions, in the lamp-lit room where the children were playing</p>
<p>forfeits, and said, &quot;There is not one boy here that DARES to kiss</p>
<p>ME!&quot; Then you ran out on the dark porch, where the honeysuckle</p>
<p>vines grew up the tall, inane Corinthian pillars.</p>
<p>Did you blame the boy for following?  And were you very angry,</p>
<p>indeed, about what happened,--until you broke out laughing at his</p>
<p>cravat, which had slipped around behind his ear?  That was the</p>
<p>first time he ever noticed how much sweeter the honeysuckle smells</p>
<p>at night than in the day.  It was his entrance examination in the</p>
<p>school of nature--human and otherwise.  He felt that there was a</p>
<p>whole continent of newly discovered poetry within him, and</p>
<p>worshipped his Columbus disguised in curls.  Your boy is your true</p>
<p>idealist, after all, although (or perhaps because) he is still</p>
<p>uncivilised.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The arrival of the rod, in four joints, with an extra tip, a brass</p>
<p>reel, and the other luxuries for which a true angler would</p>
<p>willingly exchange the necessaries of life, marked a new epoch in</p>
<p>the boy&#x27;s career.  At the uplifting of that wand, as if it had been</p>
<p>in the hand of another Moses, the waters of infancy rolled back,</p>
<p>and the way was opened into the promised land, whither the tyrant</p>
<p>nurses, with all their proud array of baby-chariots, could not</p>
<p>follow.  The way was open, but not by any means dry.  One of the</p>
<p>first events in the dispensation of the rod was the purchase of a</p>
<p>pair of high rubber boots.  Inserted in this armour of modern</p>
<p>infantry, and transfigured with delight, the boy clumped through</p>
<p>all the little rivers within a circuit of ten miles from Caldwell,</p>
<p>and began to learn by parental example the yet unmastered art of</p>
<p>complete angling.</p>
<p>But because some of the streams were deep and strong, and his legs</p>
<p>were short and slender, and his ambition was even taller than his</p>
<p>boots, the father would sometimes take him up pickaback, and wade</p>
<p>along carefully through the perilous places--which are often, in</p>
<p>this world, the very places one longs to fish in.  So, in your</p>
<p>remembrance, you can see the little rubber boots sticking out under</p>
<p>the father&#x27;s arms, and the rod projecting over his head, and the</p>
<p>bait dangling down unsteadily into the deep holes, and the</p>
<p>delighted boy hooking and playing and basketing his trout high in</p>
<p>the air.  How many of our best catches in life are made from some</p>
<p>one else&#x27;s shoulders!</p>
<p>From this summer the whole earth became to the boy, as Tennyson</p>
<p>describes the lotus country, &quot;a land of streams.&quot;  In school-days</p>
<p>and in town he acknowledged the sway of those mysterious and</p>
<p>irresistible forces which produce tops at one season, and marbles</p>
<p>at another, and kites at another, and bind all boyish hearts to</p>
<p>play mumble-the-peg at the due time more certainly than the stars</p>
<p>are bound to their orbits.  But when vacation came, with its annual</p>
<p>exodus from the city, there was only one sign in the zodiac, and</p>
<p>that was Pisces.</p>
<p>No country seemed to him tolerable without trout, and no landscape</p>
<p>beautiful unless enlivened by a young river.  Among what delectable</p>
<p>mountains did those watery guides lead his vagrant steps, and with</p>
<p>what curious, mixed, and sometimes profitable company did they make</p>
<p>him familiar!</p>
<p>There was one exquisite stream among the Alleghanies, called</p>
<p>Lycoming Creek, beside which the family spent a summer in a</p>
<p>decadent inn, kept by a tremulous landlord who was always sitting</p>
<p>on the steps of the porch, and whose most memorable remark was that</p>
<p>he had &quot;a misery in his stomach.&quot;  This form of speech amused the</p>
<p>boy, but he did not in the least comprehend it.  It was the</p>
<p>description of an unimaginable experience in a region which was as</p>
<p>yet known to him only as the seat of pleasure.  He did not</p>
<p>understand how any one could be miserable when he could catch trout</p>
<p>from his own dooryard.</p>
<p>The big creek, with its sharp turns from side to side of the</p>
<p>valley, its hemlock-shaded falls in the gorge, and its long, still</p>
<p>reaches in the &quot;sugar-bottom,&quot; where the maple-trees grew as if in</p>
<p>an orchard, and the superfluity of grasshoppers made the trout fat</p>
<p>and dainty, was too wide to fit the boy.  But nature keeps all</p>
<p>sizes in her stock, and a smaller stream, called Rocky Run, came</p>
<p>tumbling down opposite the inn, as if made to order for juvenile</p>
<p>use.</p>
<p>How well you can follow it, through the old pasture overgrown with</p>
<p>alders, and up past the broken-down mill-dam and the crumbling</p>
<p>sluice, into the mountain-cleft from which it leaps laughing!  The</p>
<p>water, except just after a rain-storm, is as transparent as glass--</p>
<p>old-fashioned window-glass, I mean, in small panes, with just a</p>
<p>tinge of green in it, like the air in a grove of young birches.</p>
<p>Twelve feet down in the narrow chasm below the falls, where the</p>
<p>water is full of tiny bubbles, like Apollinaris, you can see the</p>
<p>trout poised, with their heads up-stream, motionless, but quivering</p>
<p>a little, as if they were strung on wires.</p>
<p>The bed of the stream has been scooped out of the solid rock.  Here</p>
<p>and there banks of sand have been deposited, and accumulations of</p>
<p>loose stone disguise the real nature of the channel.  Great</p>
<p>boulders have been rolled down the alleyway and left where they</p>
<p>chanced to stick; the stream must get around them or under them as</p>
<p>best it can.  But there are other places where everything has been</p>
<p>swept clean; nothing remains but the primitive strata, and the</p>
<p>flowing water merrily tickles the bare ribs of mother earth.</p>
<p>Whirling stones, in the spring floods, have cut well-holes in the</p>
<p>rock, as round and even as if they had been made with a drill, and</p>
<p>sometimes you can see the very stone that sunk the well lying at</p>
<p>the bottom.  There are long, straight, sloping troughs through</p>
<p>which the water runs like a mill-race.  There are huge basins into</p>
<p>which the water rumbles over a ledge, as if some one were pouring</p>
<p>it very steadily out of a pitcher, and from which it glides away</p>
<p>without a ripple, flowing over a smooth pavement of rock which</p>
<p>shelves down from the shallow foot to the deep head of the pool.</p>
<p>The boy wonders how far he dare wade out along that slippery floor.</p>
<p>The water is within an inch of his boot-tops now.  But the slope</p>
<p>seems very even, and just beyond his reach a good fish is rising.</p>
<p>Only one step more, and then, like the wicked man in the psalm, his</p>
<p>feet begin to slide.  Slowly, and standing bolt upright, with the</p>
<p>rod held high above his head, as if it must on no account get wet,</p>
<p>he glides forward up to his neck in the ice-cold bath, gasping with</p>
<p>amazement.  There have been other and more serious situations in</p>
<p>life into which, unless I am mistaken, you have made an equally</p>
<p>unwilling and embarrassed entrance, and in which you have been</p>
<p>surprised to find yourself not only up to your neck, but over,--and</p>
<p>you are a lucky man if you have had the presence of mind to stand</p>
<p>still for a moment, before wading out, and make sure at least of</p>
<p>the fish that tempted you into your predicament.</p>
<p>But Rocky Run, they say, exists no longer.  It has been blasted by</p>
<p>miners out of all resemblance to itself, and bewitched into a dingy</p>
<p>water-power to turn wheels for the ugly giant, Trade.  It is only</p>
<p>in the valley of remembrance that its current still flows like</p>
<p>liquid air; and only in that country that you can still see the</p>
<p>famous men who came and went along the banks of the Lyocoming when</p>
<p>the boy was there.</p>
<p>There was Collins, who was a wondrous adept at &quot;daping, dapping, or</p>
<p>dibbling&quot; with a grasshopper, and who once brought in a string of</p>
<p>trout which he laid out head to tail on the grass before the house</p>
<p>in a line of beauty forty-seven feet long.  A mighty bass voice had</p>
<p>this Collins also, and could sing, &quot;Larboard Watch, Ahoy!&quot; &quot;Down in</p>
<p>a Coal-Mine,&quot; and other profound ditties in a way to make all the</p>
<p>glasses on the table jingle; but withal, as you now suspect, rather</p>
<p>a fishy character, and undeserving of the unqualified respect which</p>
<p>the boy had for him.  And there was Dr. Romsen, lean, satirical,</p>
<p>kindly, a skilful though reluctant physician, who regarded it as a</p>
<p>personal injury if any one in the party fell sick in summer time;</p>
<p>and a passionately unsuccessful hunter, who would sit all night in</p>
<p>the crotch of a tree beside an alleged deer-lick, and come home</p>
<p>perfectly satisfied if he had heard a hedgehog grunt.  It was he</p>
<p>who called attention to the discrepancy between the boy&#x27;s appetite</p>
<p>and his size by saying loudly at a picnic, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t grudge you</p>
<p>what you eat, my boy, if I could only see that it did you any</p>
<p>good,&quot;--which remark was not forgiven until the doctor redeemed his</p>
<p>reputation by pronouncing a serious medical opinion, before a</p>
<p>council of mothers, to the effect that it did not really hurt a boy</p>
<p>to get his feet wet.  That was worthy of Galen in his most inspired</p>
<p>moment.  And there was hearty, genial Paul Merit, whose mere</p>
<p>company was an education in good manners, and who could eat eight</p>
<p>hard-boiled eggs for supper without ruffling his equanimity; and</p>
<p>the tall, thin, grinning Major, whom an angry Irishwoman once</p>
<p>described as &quot;like a comb, all back and teeth;&quot; and many more were</p>
<p>the comrades of the boy&#x27;s father, all of whom he admired, (and</p>
<p>followed when they would let him,) but none so much as the father</p>
<p>himself, because he was the wisest, kindest, and merriest of all</p>
<p>that merry crew, now dispersed to the uttermost parts of the earth</p>
<p>and beyond.</p>
<p>Other streams played a part in the education of that happy boy: the</p>
<p>Kaaterskill, where there had been nothing but the ghosts of trout</p>
<p>for the last thirty years, but where the absence of fish was almost</p>
<p>forgotten in the joy of a first introduction to Dickens, one very</p>
<p>showery day, when dear old Ned Mason built a smoky fire in a cave</p>
<p>below Haines&#x27;s Falls, and, pulling The Old Curiosity Shop out of</p>
<p>his pocket, read aloud about Little Nell until the tears ran down</p>
<p>the cheeks of reader and listener--the smoke was so thick, you</p>
<p>know: and the Neversink, which flows through John Burroughs&#x27;s</p>
<p>country, and past one house in particular, perched on a high bluff,</p>
<p>where a very dreadful old woman come out and throws stones at &quot;city</p>
<p>fellers fishin&#x27; through her land&quot; (as if any one wanted to touch</p>
<p>her land!  It was the water that ran over it, you see, that carried</p>
<p>the fish with it, and they were not hers at all): and the stream at</p>
<p>Healing Springs, in the Virginia mountains, where the medicinal</p>
<p>waters flow down into a lovely wild brook without injuring the</p>
<p>health of the trout in the least, and where the only drawback to</p>
<p>the angler&#x27;s happiness is the abundance of rattlesnakes--but a boy</p>
<p>does not mind such things as that; he feels as if he were immortal.</p>
<p>Over all these streams memory skips lightly, and strikes a trail</p>
<p>through the woods to the Adirondacks, where the boy made his first</p>
<p>acquaintance with navigable rivers,--that is to say, rivers which</p>
<p>are traversed by canoes and hunting-skiffs, but not yet defiled by</p>
<p>steamboats,--and slept, or rather lay awake, for the first time on</p>
<p>a bed of balsam-boughs in a tent.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The promotion from all-day picnics to a two weeks&#x27; camping-trip is</p>
<p>like going from school to college.  By this time a natural process</p>
<p>of evolution has raised the first rod to something lighter and more</p>
<p>flexible,--a fly-rod, so to speak, but not a bigoted one,--just a</p>
<p>serviceable, unprejudiced article, not above using any kind of bait</p>
<p>that may be necessary to catch the fish.  The father has received</p>
<p>the new title of &quot;governor,&quot; indicating not less, but more</p>
<p>authority, and has called in new instructors to carry on the boy&#x27;s</p>
<p>education: real Adirondack guides--old Sam Dunning and one-eyed</p>
<p>Enos, the last and laziest of the Saranac Indians.  Better men will</p>
<p>be discovered for later trips, but none more amusing, and none</p>
<p>whose woodcraft seems more wonderful than that of this queerly</p>
<p>matched team, as they make the first camp in a pelting rain-storm</p>
<p>on the shore of Big Clear Pond.  The pitching of the tents is a</p>
<p>lesson in architecture, the building of the camp-fire a victory</p>
<p>over damp nature, and the supper of potatoes and bacon and fried</p>
<p>trout a veritable triumph of culinary art.</p>
<p>At midnight the rain is pattering persistently on the canvas; the</p>
<p>fronts flaps are closed and tied together; the lingering fire</p>
<p>shines through them, and sends vague shadows wavering up and down:</p>
<p>the governor is rolled up in his blankets, sound asleep.  It is a</p>
<p>very long night for the boy.</p>
<p>What is that rustling noise outside the tent?  Probably some small</p>
<p>creature, a squirrel or a rabbit.  Rabbit stew would be good for</p>
<p>breakfast.  But it sounds louder now, almost loud enough to be a</p>
<p>fox,--there are no wolves left in the Adirondacks, or at least only</p>
<p>a very few.  That is certainly quite a heavy footstep prowling</p>
<p>around the provision-box.  Could it be a panther,--they step very</p>
<p>softly for their size,--or a bear perhaps?  Sam Dunning told about</p>
<p>catching one in a trap just below here.  (Ah, my boy, you will soon</p>
<p>learn that there is no spot in all the forests created by a</p>
<p>bountiful Providence so poor as to be without its bear story.)</p>
<p>Where was the rifle put?  There it is, at the foot of the tent-</p>
<p>pole.  Wonder if it is loaded?</p>
<p>&quot;Waugh-ho!  Waugh-ho-o-o-o!&quot;</p>
<p>The boy springs from his blankets like a cat, and peeps out between</p>
<p>the tent-flaps.  There sits Enos, in the shelter of a leaning tree</p>
<p>by the fire, with his head thrown back and a bottle poised at his</p>
<p>mouth.  His lonely eye is cocked up at a great horned owl on the</p>
<p>branch above him.  Again the sudden voice breaks out:</p>
<p>&quot;Whoo! whoo! whoo cooks for you all?&quot;</p>
<p>Enos puts the bottle down, with a grunt, and creeps off to his</p>
<p>tent.</p>
<p>&quot;De debbil in dat owl,&quot; he mutters.  &quot;How he know I cook for dis</p>
<p>camp?  How he know &#x27;bout dat bottle?  Ugh!&quot;</p>
<p>There are hundreds of pictures that flash into light as the boy</p>
<p>goes on his course, year after year, through the woods.  There is</p>
<p>the luxurious camp on Tupper&#x27;s Lake, with its log cabins in the</p>
<p>spruce-grove, and its regiment of hungry men who ate almost a deer</p>
<p>a day; and there is the little bark shelter on the side of Mount</p>
<p>Marcy, where the governor and the boy, with baskets full of trout</p>
<p>from the Opalescent River, are spending the night, with nothing but</p>
<p>a fire to keep them warm.  There is the North Bay at Moosehead,</p>
<p>with Joe La Croix (one more Frenchman who thinks he looks like</p>
<p>Napoleon) posing on the rocks beside his canoe, and only reconciled</p>
<p>by his vanity to the wasteful pastime of taking photographs while</p>
<p>the big fish are rising gloriously out at the end of the point.</p>
<p>There is the small spring-hole beside the Saranac River, where</p>
<p>Pliny Robbins and the boy caught twenty-three noble trout, weighing</p>
<p>from one to three pounds apiece, in the middle of a hot August</p>
<p>afternoon, and hid themselves in the bushes when ever they heard a</p>
<p>party coming down the river, because they did not care to attract</p>
<p>company; and there are the Middle Falls, where the governor stood</p>
<p>on a long spruce log, taking two-pound fish with the fly, and</p>
<p>stepping out at every cast a little nearer to the end of the log,</p>
<p>until it slowly tipped with him, and he settled down into the</p>
<p>river.</p>
<p>Among such scenes as these the boy pursued his education, learning</p>
<p>many things that are not taught in colleges; learning to take the</p>
<p>weather as it comes, wet or dry, and fortune as it falls, good or</p>
<p>bad; learning that a meal which is scanty fare for one becomes a</p>
<p>banquet for two--provided the other is the right person; learning</p>
<p>that there is some skill in everything, even in digging bait, and</p>
<p>that what is called luck consists chiefly in having your tackle in</p>
<p>good order; learning that a man can be just as happy in a log</p>
<p>shanty as in a brownstone mansion, and that the very best pleasures</p>
<p>are those that do not leave a bad taste in the mouth.  And in all</p>
<p>this the governor was his best teacher and his closest comrade.</p>
<p>Dear governor, you have gone out of the wilderness now, and your</p>
<p>steps will be no more beside these remembered little rivers--no</p>
<p>more, forever and forever.  You will not come in sight around any</p>
<p>bend of this clear Swiftwater stream where you made your last cast;</p>
<p>your cheery voice will never again ring out through the deepening</p>
<p>twilight where you are lingering for your disciple to catch up with</p>
<p>you; he will never again hear you call: &quot;Hallo, my boy!  What luck?</p>
<p>Time to go home!&quot;  But there is a river in the country where you</p>
<p>have gone, is there not?--a river with trees growing all along it--</p>
<p>evergreen trees; and somewhere by those shady banks, within sound</p>
<p>of clear running waters, I think you will be dreaming and waiting</p>
<p>for your boy, if he follows the trail that you have shown him even</p>
<p>to the end.</p>

<p>AMPERSAND</p>
<p>It is not the walking merely, it is keeping yourself in tune for a</p>
<p>walk, in the spiritual and bodily condition in which you can find</p>
<p>entertainment and exhilaration in so simple and natural a pastime.</p>
<p>You are eligible to any good fortune when you are in a condition to</p>
<p>enjoy a walk.  When the air and water taste sweet to you, how much</p>
<p>else will taste sweet!  When the exercise of your limbs affords you</p>
<p>pleasure, and the play of your senses upon the various objects and</p>
<p>shows of Nature quickens and stimulates your spirit, your relation</p>
<p>to the world and to yourself is what it should be,--simple, and</p>
<p>direct, and wholesome.&quot;--JOHN BURROUGHS: Pepacton.</p>
<p>The right to the name of Ampersand, like the territory of Gaul in</p>
<p>those Commentaries which Julius Caesar wrote for the punishment of</p>
<p>schoolboys, is divided into three parts.  It belongs to a mountain,</p>
<p>and a lake, and a little river.</p>
<p>The mountain stands in the heart of the Adirondack country, just</p>
<p>near enough to the thoroughfare of travel for thousands of people</p>
<p>to see it every year, and just far enough from the beaten track to</p>
<p>be unvisited except by a very few of the wise ones, who love to</p>
<p>turn aside.  Behind the mountain is the lake, which no lazy man has</p>
<p>ever seen.  Out of the lake flows the stream, winding down a long,</p>
<p>untrodden forest valley, to join the Stony Creek waters and empty</p>
<p>into the Raquette River.</p>
<p>Which of the three Ampersands has the prior claim to the name, I</p>
<p>cannot tell.  Philosophically speaking, the mountain ought to be</p>
<p>regarded as the head of the family, because it was undoubtedly</p>
<p>there before the others.  And the lake was probably the next on the</p>
<p>ground, because the stream is its child.  But man is not strictly</p>
<p>just in his nomenclature; and I conjecture that the little river,</p>
<p>the last-born of the three, was the first to be christened</p>
<p>Ampersand, and then gave its name to its parent and grand-parent.</p>
<p>It is such a crooked stream, so bent and curved and twisted upon</p>
<p>itself, so fond of turning around unexpected corners and sweeping</p>
<p>away in great circles from its direct course, that its first</p>
<p>explorers christened it after the eccentric supernumerary of the</p>
<p>alphabet which appears in the old spelling-books as &amp;--and per se,</p>
<p>and.</p>
<p>But in spite of this apparent subordination to the stream in the</p>
<p>matter of a name, the mountain clearly asserts its natural</p>
<p>authority.  It stands up boldly; and not only its own lake, but at</p>
<p>least three others, the Lower Saranac, Round Lake, and Lonesome</p>
<p>Pond, lie at its foot and acknowledge its lordship.  When the cloud</p>
<p>is on its brow, they are dark.  When the sunlight strikes it, they</p>
<p>smile.</p>
<p>Wherever you may go over the waters of these lakes you shall see</p>
<p>Mount Ampersand looking down at you, and saying quietly, &quot;This is</p>
<p>my domain.&quot;</p>
<p>I never look at a mountain which asserts itself in this fashion</p>
<p>without desiring to stand on the top of it.  If one can reach the</p>
<p>summit, one becomes a sharer in the dominion.  The difficulties in</p>
<p>the way only add to the zest of the victory.  Every mountain is,</p>
<p>rightly considered, an invitation to climb.  And as I was resting</p>
<p>for a month one summer at Bartlett&#x27;s, Ampersand challenged me</p>
<p>daily.</p>
<p>Did you know Bartlett&#x27;s in its palmy time?  It was the homeliest,</p>
<p>quaintest, coziest place in the Adirondacks.  Away back in the</p>
<p>ante-bellum days Virgil Bartlett had come into the woods, and built</p>
<p>his house on the bank of the Saranac River, between the Upper</p>
<p>Saranac and Round Lake.  It was then the only dwelling within a</p>
<p>circle of many miles.  The deer and bear were in the majority.  At</p>
<p>night one could sometimes hear the scream of the panther or the</p>
<p>howling of wolves.  But soon the wilderness began to wear the</p>
<p>traces of a conventional smile.  The desert blossomed a little--if</p>
<p>not as the rose, at least as the gilly-flower.  Fields were</p>
<p>cleared, gardens planted; half a dozen log cabins were scattered</p>
<p>along the river; and the old house, having grown slowly and</p>
<p>somewhat irregularly for twenty years, came out, just before the</p>
<p>time of which I write, in a modest coat of paint and a broad-</p>
<p>brimmed piazza.  But Virgil himself, the creator of the oasis--well</p>
<p>known of hunters and fishermen, dreaded of lazy guides and</p>
<p>quarrelsome lumbermen,--&quot;Virge,&quot; the irascible, kind-hearted,</p>
<p>indefatigable, was there no longer.  He had made his last clearing,</p>
<p>and fought his last fight; done his last favour to a friend, and</p>
<p>thrown his last adversary out of the tavern door.  His last log had</p>
<p>gone down the river.  His camp-fire had burned out.  Peace to his</p>
<p>ashes.  His wife, who had often played the part of Abigail toward</p>
<p>travellers who had unconsciously incurred the old man&#x27;s mistrust,</p>
<p>now reigned in his stead; and there was great abundance of maple-</p>
<p>syrup on every man&#x27;s flapjack.</p>
<p>The charm of Bartlett&#x27;s for the angler was the stretch of rapid</p>
<p>water in front of the house.  The Saranac River, breaking from its</p>
<p>first resting-place in the Upper Lake, plunged down through a great</p>
<p>bed of rocks, making a chain of short falls and pools and rapids,</p>
<p>about half a mile in length.  Here, in the spring and early summer,</p>
<p>the speckled trout--brightest and daintiest of all fish that swim--</p>
<p>used to be found in great numbers.  As the season advanced, they</p>
<p>moved away into the deep water of the lakes.  But there were always</p>
<p>a few stragglers left, and I have taken them in the rapids at the</p>
<p>very end of August.  What could be more delightful than to spend an</p>
<p>hour or two, in the early morning or evening of a hot day, in</p>
<p>wading this rushing stream, and casting the fly on its clear</p>
<p>waters?  The wind blows softly down the narrow valley, and the</p>
<p>trees nod from the rocks above you.  The noise of the falls makes</p>
<p>constant music in your ears.  The river hurries past you, and yet</p>
<p>it is never gone.</p>
<p>The same foam-flakes seem to be always gliding downward, the same</p>
<p>spray dashing over the stones, the same eddy coiling at the edge of</p>
<p>the pool.  Send your fly in under those cedar branches, where the</p>
<p>water swirls around by that old log.  Now draw it up toward the</p>
<p>foam.  There is a sudden gleam of dull gold in the white water.</p>
<p>You strike too soon.  Your line comes back to you.  In a current</p>
<p>like this, a fish will almost always hook himself.  Try it again.</p>
<p>This time he takes the fly fairly, and you have him.  It is a good</p>
<p>fish, and he makes the slender rod bend to the strain.  He sulks</p>
<p>for a moment as if uncertain what to do, and then with a rush darts</p>
<p>into the swiftest part of the current.  You can never stop him</p>
<p>there.  Let him go.  Keep just enough pressure on him to hold the</p>
<p>hook firm, and follow his troutship down the stream as if he were a</p>
<p>salmon.  He slides over a little fall, gleaming through the foam,</p>
<p>and swings around in the next pool.  Here you can manage him more</p>
<p>easily; and after a few minutes&#x27; brilliant play, a few mad dashes</p>
<p>for the current, he comes to the net, and your skilful guide lands</p>
<p>him with a quick, steady sweep of the arm.  The scales credit him</p>
<p>with an even pound, and a better fish than this you will hardly</p>
<p>take here in midsummer.</p>
<p>&quot;On my word, master,&quot; says the appreciative Venator, in Walton&#x27;s</p>
<p>Angler, &quot;this is a gallant trout; what shall we do with him?&quot;  And</p>
<p>honest Piscator, replies: &quot;Marry! e&#x27;en eat him to supper; we&#x27;ll go</p>
<p>to my hostess from whence we came; she told me, as I was going out</p>
<p>of door, that my brother Peter, [and who is this but Romeyn of</p>
<p>Keeseville?] a good angler and a cheerful companion, had sent word</p>
<p>he would lodge there tonight, and bring a friend with him.  My</p>
<p>hostess has two beds, and I know you and I have the best; we&#x27;ll</p>
<p>rejoice with my brother Peter and his friend, tell tales, or sing</p>
<p>ballads, or make a catch, or find some harmless sport to content</p>
<p>us, and pass away a little time without offence to God or man.&quot;</p>
<p>Ampersand waited immovable while I passed many days in such</p>
<p>innocent and healthful pleasures as these, until the right day came</p>
<p>for the ascent.  Cool, clean, and bright, the crystal morning</p>
<p>promised a glorious noon, and the mountain almost seemed to beckon</p>
<p>us to come up higher.  The photographic camera and a trustworthy</p>
<p>lunch were stowed away in the pack-basket.  The backboard was</p>
<p>adjusted at a comfortable angle in the stern seat of our little</p>
<p>boat.  The guide held the little craft steady while I stepped into</p>
<p>my place; then he pushed out into the stream, and we went swiftly</p>
<p>down toward Round Lake.</p>
<p>A Saranac boat is one of the finest things that the skill of man</p>
<p>has ever produced under the inspiration of the wilderness.  It is a</p>
<p>frail shell, so light that a guide can carry it on his shoulders</p>
<p>with ease, but so dexterously fashioned that it rides the heaviest</p>
<p>waves like a duck, and slips through the water as if by magic.  You</p>
<p>can travel in it along the shallowest rivers and across the</p>
<p>broadest lakes, and make forty or fifty miles a day, if you have a</p>
<p>good guide.</p>
<p>Everything depends, in the Adirondacks, as in so many other regions</p>
<p>of life, upon your guide.  If he is selfish, or surly, or stupid,</p>
<p>you will have a bad time.  But if he is an Adirondacker of the best</p>
<p>old-fashioned type,--now unhappily growing more rare from year to</p>
<p>year,--you will find him an inimitable companion, honest, faithful,</p>
<p>skilful and cheerful.  He is as independent as a prince, and the</p>
<p>gilded youths and finicking fine ladies who attempt to patronise</p>
<p>him are apt to make but a sorry show before his solid and</p>
<p>undisguised contempt.  But deal with him man to man, and he will</p>
<p>give you a friendly, loyal service which money cannot buy, and</p>
<p>teach you secrets of woodcraft and lessons in plain, self-reliant</p>
<p>manhood more valuable than all the learning of the schools.  Such a</p>
<p>guide was mine, rejoicing in the Scriptural name of Hosea, but</p>
<p>commonly called, in brevity and friendliness, &quot;Hose.&quot;</p>
<p>As we entered Round Lake on this fair morning, its surface was as</p>
<p>smooth and shining as a mirror.  It was too early yet for the tide</p>
<p>of travel which sends a score of boats up and down this</p>
<p>thoroughfare every day; and from shore to shore the water was</p>
<p>unruffled, except by a flock of sheldrakes which had been feeding</p>
<p>near Plymouth Rock, and now went skittering off into Weller Bay</p>
<p>with a motion between flying and swimming, leaving a long wake of</p>
<p>foam behind them.</p>
<p>At such a time as this you can see the real colour of these</p>
<p>Adirondack lakes.  It is not blue, as romantic writers so often</p>
<p>describe it, nor green, like some of those wonderful Swiss lakes;</p>
<p>although of course it reflects the colour of the trees along the</p>
<p>shore; and when the wind stirs it, it gives back the hue of the</p>
<p>sky, blue when it is clear, gray when the clouds are gathering, and</p>
<p>sometimes as black as ink under the shadow of storm.  But when it</p>
<p>is still, the water itself is like that river which one of the</p>
<p>poets has described as</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&quot;Flowing with a smooth brown current.&quot;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>And in this sheet of burnished bronze the mountains and islands</p>
<p>were reflected perfectly, and the sun shone back from it, not in</p>
<p>broken gleams or a wide lane of light, but like a single ball of</p>
<p>fire, moving before us as we moved.</p>
<p>But stop!  What is that dark speck on the water, away down toward</p>
<p>Turtle Point?  It has just the shape and size of a deer&#x27;s head.  It</p>
<p>seems to move steadily out into the lake.  There is a little</p>
<p>ripple, like a wake, behind it.  Hose turns to look at it, and then</p>
<p>sends the boat darting in that direction with long, swift strokes.</p>
<p>It is a moment of pleasant excitement, and we begin to conjecture</p>
<p>whether the deer is a buck or a doe, and whose hounds have driven</p>
<p>it in.  But when Hose turns to look again, he slackens his stroke,</p>
<p>and says: &quot;I guess we needn&#x27;t to hurry; he won&#x27;t get away.  It&#x27;s</p>
<p>astonishin&#x27; what a lot of fun a man can get in the course of a</p>
<p>natural life a-chasm&#x27; chumps of wood.&quot;</p>
<p>We landed on a sand beach at the mouth of a little stream, where a</p>
<p>blazed tree marked the beginning of the Ampersand trail.  This line</p>
<p>through the forest was made years ago by that ardent sportsman and</p>
<p>lover of the Adirondacks, Dr. W. W. Ely, of Rochester.  Since that</p>
<p>time it has been shortened and improved a little by other</p>
<p>travellers, and also not a little blocked and confused by the</p>
<p>lumbermen and the course of Nature.  For when the lumbermen go into</p>
<p>the woods, they cut roads in every direction, leading nowhither,</p>
<p>and the unwary wanderer is thereby led aside from the right way,</p>
<p>and entangled in the undergrowth.  And as for Nature, she is</p>
<p>entirely opposed to continuance of paths through her forest.  She</p>
<p>covers them with fallen leaves, and hides them with thick bushes.</p>
<p>She drops great trees across them, and blots then out with</p>
<p>windfalls.  But the blazed line--a succession of broad axe-marks on</p>
<p>the trunks of the trees, just high enough to catch the eye on a</p>
<p>level--cannot be so easily obliterated, and this, after all, is the</p>
<p>safest guide through the woods.</p>
<p>Our trail led us at first through a natural meadow, overgrown with</p>
<p>waist-high grass, and very spongy to the tread.  Hornet-haunted</p>
<p>also was this meadow, and therefore no place for idle dalliance or</p>
<p>unwary digression, for the sting of the hornet is one of the</p>
<p>saddest and most humiliating surprises of this mortal life.</p>
<p>Then through a tangle of old wood-roads my guide led me safely, and</p>
<p>we struck one of the long ridges which slope gently from the lake</p>
<p>to the base of the mountain.  Here walking was comparatively easy,</p>
<p>for in the hard-wood timber there is little underbrush.  The</p>
<p>massive trunks seemed like pillars set to uphold the level roof of</p>
<p>green.  Great yellow birches, shaggy with age, stretched their</p>
<p>knotted arms high above us; sugar-maples stood up straight and</p>
<p>proud under their leafy crowns; and smooth beeches--the most</p>
<p>polished and parklike of all the forest trees--offered</p>
<p>opportunities for the carving of lovers&#x27; names in a place where few</p>
<p>lovers ever come.</p>
<p>The woods were quiet.  It seemed as if all living creatures had</p>
<p>deserted them.  Indeed, if you have spent much time in our Northern</p>
<p>forests, you must have often wondered at the sparseness of life,</p>
<p>and felt a sense of pity for the apparent loneliness of the</p>
<p>squirrel that chatters at you as you pass, or the little bird that</p>
<p>hops noiselessly about in the thickets.  The midsummer noontide is</p>
<p>an especially silent time.  The deer are asleep in some wild</p>
<p>meadow.  The partridge has gathered her brood for their midday nap.</p>
<p>The squirrels are perhaps counting over their store of nuts in a</p>
<p>hollow tree, and the hermit-thrush spares his voice until evening.</p>
<p>The woods are close--not cool and fragrant as the foolish romances</p>
<p>describe them--but warm and still; for the breeze which sweeps</p>
<p>across the hilltop and ruffles the lake does not penetrate into</p>
<p>these shady recesses, and therefore all the inhabitants take the</p>
<p>noontide as their hour of rest.  Only the big woodpecker--he of the</p>
<p>scarlet head and mighty bill--is indefatigable, and somewhere</p>
<p>unseen is &quot;tapping the hollow beech-tree,&quot; while a wakeful little</p>
<p>bird,--I guess it is the black-throated green warbler,--prolongs</p>
<p>his dreamy, listless ditty,--&#x27;te-de-terit-sca,--&#x27;te-de-us--wait.</p>
<p>After about an hour of easy walking, our trail began to ascend more</p>
<p>sharply.  We passed over the shoulder of a ridge and around the</p>
<p>edge of a fire-slash, and then we had the mountain fairly before</p>
<p>us.  Not that we could see anything of it, for the woods still shut</p>
<p>us in, but the path became very steep, and we knew that it was a</p>
<p>straight climb; not up and down and round about did this most</p>
<p>uncompromising trail proceed, but right up, in a direct line for</p>
<p>the summit.</p>
<p>Now this side of Ampersand is steeper than any Gothic roof I have</p>
<p>ever seen, and withal very much encumbered with rocks and ledges</p>
<p>and fallen trees.  There were places where we had to haul ourselves</p>
<p>up by roots and branches, and places where we had to go down on our</p>
<p>hands and knees to crawl under logs.  It was breathless work, but</p>
<p>not at all dangerous or difficult.  Every step forward was also a</p>
<p>step upward; and as we stopped to rest for a moment, we could see</p>
<p>already glimpses of the lake below us.  But at these I did not much</p>
<p>care to look, for I think it is a pity to spoil the surprise of a</p>
<p>grand view by taking little snatches of it beforehand.  It is</p>
<p>better to keep one&#x27;s face set to the mountain, and then, coming out</p>
<p>from the dark forest upon the very summit, feel the splendour of</p>
<p>the outlook flash upon one like a revelation.</p>
<p>The character of the woods through which we were now passing was</p>
<p>entirely different from those of the lower levels.  On these steep</p>
<p>places the birch and maple will not grow, or at least they occur</p>
<p>but sparsely.  The higher slopes and sharp ridges of the mountains</p>
<p>are always covered with soft-wood timber.  Spruce and hemlock and</p>
<p>balsam strike their roots among the rocks, and find a hidden</p>
<p>nourishment.  They stand close together; thickets of small trees</p>
<p>spring up among the large ones; from year to year the great trunks</p>
<p>are falling one across another, and the undergrowth is thickening</p>
<p>around them, until a spruce forest seems to be almost impassable.</p>
<p>The constant rain of needles and the crumbling of the fallen trees</p>
<p>form a rich, brown mould, into which the foot sinks noiselessly.</p>
<p>Wonderful beds of moss, many feet in thickness, and softer than</p>
<p>feathers, cover the rocks and roots.  There are shadows never</p>
<p>broken by the sun, and dark, cool springs of icy water hidden away</p>
<p>in the crevices.  You feel a sense of antiquity here which you can</p>
<p>never feel among the maples and birches.  Longfellow was right when</p>
<p>he filled his forest primeval with &quot;murmuring pines and hemlocks.&quot;</p>
<p>The higher one climbs, the darker and gloomier and more rugged the</p>
<p>vegetation becomes.  The pine-trees soon cease to follow you; the</p>
<p>hemlocks disappear, and the balsams can go no farther.  Only the</p>
<p>hardy spruce keeps on bravely, rough and stunted, with branches</p>
<p>matted together and pressed down flat by the weight of the winter&#x27;s</p>
<p>snow, until finally, somewhere about the level of four thousand</p>
<p>feet above the sea, even this bold climber gives out, and the</p>
<p>weather-beaten rocks of the summit are clad only with mosses and</p>
<p>Alpine plants.</p>
<p>Thus it is with mountains, as perhaps with men, a mark of superior</p>
<p>dignity to be naturally bald.</p>
<p>Ampersand, falling short by a thousand feet of the needful height,</p>
<p>cannot claim this distinction.  But what Nature has denied, human</p>
<p>labour has supplied.  Under the direction of the Adirondack Survey,</p>
<p>some years ago, several acres of trees were cut from the summit;</p>
<p>and when we emerged, after the last sharp scramble, upon the very</p>
<p>crest of the mountain, we were not shut in by a dense thicket, but</p>
<p>stood upon a bare ridge of granite in the centre of a ragged</p>
<p>clearing.</p>
<p>I shut my eyes for a moment, drew a few long breaths of the</p>
<p>glorious breeze, and then looked out upon a wonder and a delight</p>
<p>beyond description.</p>
<p>A soft, dazzling splendour filled the air.  Snowy banks and drifts</p>
<p>of cloud were floating slowly over a wide and wondrous land.  Vast</p>
<p>sweeps of forest, shining waters, mountains near and far, the</p>
<p>deepest green and the palest blue, changing colours and glancing</p>
<p>lights, and all so silent, so strange, so far away, that it seemed</p>
<p>like the landscape of a dream.  One almost feared to speak, lest it</p>
<p>should vanish.</p>
<p>Right below us the Lower Saranac and Lonesome Pond, Round Lake and</p>
<p>the Weller Ponds, were spread out like a map.  Every point and</p>
<p>island was clearly marked.  We could follow the course of the</p>
<p>Saranac River in all its curves and windings, and see the white</p>
<p>tents of the hay-makers on the wild meadows.  Far away to the</p>
<p>northeast stretched the level fields of Bloomingdale.  But westward</p>
<p>all was unbroken wilderness, a great sea of woods as far as the eye</p>
<p>could reach.  And how far it can reach from a height like this!</p>
<p>What a revelation of the power of sight!  That faint blue outline</p>
<p>far in the north was Lyon Mountain, nearly thirty miles away as the</p>
<p>crow flies.  Those silver gleams a little nearer were the waters of</p>
<p>St. Regis.  The Upper Saranac was displayed in all its length and</p>
<p>breadth, and beyond it the innumerable waters of Fish Creek were</p>
<p>tangled among the dark woods.  The long ranges of the hills about</p>
<p>the Jordan bounded the western horizon, and on the southwest Big</p>
<p>Tupper Lake was sleeping at the base of Mount Morris.  Looking past</p>
<p>the peak of Stony Creek Mountain, which rose sharp and distinct in</p>
<p>a line with Ampersand, we could trace the path of the Raquette</p>
<p>River from the distant waters of Long Lake down through its far-</p>
<p>stretched valley, and catch here and there a silvery link of its</p>
<p>current.</p>
<p>But when we turned to the south and east, how wonderful and how</p>
<p>different was the view!  Here was no widespread and smiling</p>
<p>landscape with gleams of silver scattered through it, and soft blue</p>
<p>haze resting upon its fading verge, but a wild land of mountains,</p>
<p>stern, rugged, tumultuous, rising one beyond another like the waves</p>
<p>of a stormy ocean,--Ossa piled upin Pelion,--Mcintyre&#x27;s sharp peak,</p>
<p>and the ragged crest of the Gothics, and, above all, Marcy&#x27;s dome-</p>
<p>like head, raised just far enough above the others to assert his</p>
<p>royal right as monarch of the Adirondacks.</p>
<p>But grandest of all, as seen from this height, was Mount Seward,--a</p>
<p>solemn giant of a mountain, standing apart from the others, and</p>
<p>looking us full in the face.  He was clothed from base to summit in</p>
<p>a dark, unbroken robe of forest.  Ou-kor-lah, the Indians called</p>
<p>him--the Great Eye; and he seemed almost to frown upon us in</p>
<p>defiance.  At his feet, so straight below us that it seemed almost</p>
<p>as if we could cast a stone into it, lay the wildest and most</p>
<p>beautiful of all the Adirondack waters--Ampersand Lake.</p>
<p>On its shore, some five-and-twenty years ago, the now almost</p>
<p>forgotten Adirondack Club had their shanty--the successor of &quot;the</p>
<p>Philosophers&#x27; Camp&quot; on Follensbee Pond.  Agassiz, Appleton, Norton,</p>
<p>Emerson, Lowell, Hoar, Gray, John Holmes, and Stillman, were among</p>
<p>the company who made their resting-place under the shadow of Mount</p>
<p>Seward.  They had bought a tract of forest land completely</p>
<p>encircling the pond, cut a rough road to it through the woods, and</p>
<p>built a comfortable log cabin, to which they purposed to return</p>
<p>summer after summer.  But the civil war broke out, with all its</p>
<p>terrible excitement and confusion of hurrying hosts: the club</p>
<p>existed but for two years, and the little house in the wilderness</p>
<p>was abandoned.  In 1878, when I spent three weeks at Ampersand, the</p>
<p>cabin was in ruins, and surrounded by an almost impenetrable growth</p>
<p>of bushes.  The only philosophers to be seen were a family of what</p>
<p>the guides quaintly call &quot;quill pigs.&quot;  The roof had fallen to the</p>
<p>ground; raspberry-bushes thrust themselves through the yawning</p>
<p>crevices between the logs; and in front of the sunken door-sill lay</p>
<p>a rusty, broken iron stove, like a dismantled altar on which the</p>
<p>fire had gone out forever.</p>
<p>After we had feasted upon the view as long as we dared, counted the</p>
<p>lakes and streams, and found that we could see without a glass more</p>
<p>than thirty, and recalled the memories of &quot;good times&quot; which came</p>
<p>to us from almost every point of the compass, we unpacked the</p>
<p>camera, and proceeded to take some pictures.</p>
<p>If you are a photographer, and have anything of the amateur&#x27;s</p>
<p>passion for your art, you will appreciate my pleasure and my</p>
<p>anxiety.  Never before, so far as I knew, had a camera been set up</p>
<p>on Ampersand.  I had but eight plates with me.  The views were all</p>
<p>very distant and all at a downward angle.  The power of the light</p>
<p>at this elevation was an unknown quantity.  And the wind was</p>
<p>sweeping vigorously across the open summit of the mountain.  I put</p>
<p>in my smallest stop, and prepared for short exposures.</p>
<p>My instrument was a thing called a Tourograph, which differs from</p>
<p>most other cameras in having the plate-holder on top of the box.</p>
<p>The plates are dropped into a groove below, and then moved into</p>
<p>focus, after which the cap is removed and the exposure made.</p>
<p>I set my instrument for Ampersand Pond, sighted the picture through</p>
<p>the ground glass, and measured the focus.  Then I waited for a</p>
<p>quiet moment, dropped the plate, moved it carefully forward to the</p>
<p>proper mark, and went around to take off the cap.  I found that I</p>
<p>already had it in my hand, and the plate had been exposed for about</p>
<p>thirty seconds with a sliding focus!</p>
<p>I expostulated with myself.  I said: &quot;You are excited; you are</p>
<p>stupid; you are unworthy of the name of photographer.  Light-</p>
<p>writer!  You ought to write with a whitewash-brush!&quot;  The reproof</p>
<p>was effectual, and from that moment all went well.  The plates</p>
<p>dropped smoothly, the camera was steady, the exposure was correct.</p>
<p>Six good pictures were made, to recall, so far as black and white</p>
<p>could do it, the delights of that day.</p>
<p>It has been my good luck to climb many of the peaks of the</p>
<p>Adirondacks--Dix, the Dial, Hurricane, the Giant of the Valley,</p>
<p>Marcy, and Whiteface--but I do not think the outlook from any of</p>
<p>them is so wonderful and lovely as that from little Ampersand: and</p>
<p>I reckon among my most valuable chattels the plates of glass on</p>
<p>which the sun has traced for me (who cannot draw) the outlines of</p>
<p>that loveliest landscape.</p>
<p>The downward journey was swift.  We halted for an hour or two</p>
<p>beside a trickling spring, a few rods below the summit, to eat our</p>
<p>lunch.  Then, jumping, running, and sometimes sliding, we made the</p>
<p>descent, passed in safety by the dreaded lair of the hornet, and</p>
<p>reached Bartlett&#x27;s as the fragrance of the evening pancake was</p>
<p>softly diffused through the twilight.  Mark that day, Memory, with</p>
<p>a double star in your catalogue!</p>

<p>A HANDFUL OF HEATHER</p>
<p>&quot;Scotland is the home of romance because it is the home of Scott,</p>
<p>Burns, Black, Macdonald, Stevenson, and Barrie--and of thousands of</p>
<p>men like that old Highlander in kilts on the tow-path, who loves</p>
<p>what they have written.  I would wager he has a copy of Burns in</p>
<p>his sporran, and has quoted him half a dozen times to the grim Celt</p>
<p>who is walking with him.  Those old boys don&#x27;t read for excitement</p>
<p>or knowledge, but because they love their land and their people and</p>
<p>their religion--and their great writers simply express their</p>
<p>emotions for them in words they can understand.  You and I come</p>
<p>over here, with thousands of our countrymen, to borrow their</p>
<p>emotions.&quot;--ROBERT BRIDGES: Overheard in Arcady.</p>
<p>My friend the Triumphant Democrat, fiercest of radicals and kindest</p>
<p>of men, expresses his scorn for monarchical institutions (and his</p>
<p>invincible love for his native Scotland) by tenanting, summer after</p>
<p>summer, a famous castle among the heathery Highlands.  There he</p>
<p>proclaims the most uncompromising Americanism in a speech that</p>
<p>grows more broadly Scotch with every week of his emancipation from</p>
<p>the influence of the clipped, commercial accent of New York, and</p>
<p>casts contempt on feudalism by playing the part of lord of the</p>
<p>manor to such a perfection of high-handed beneficence that the</p>
<p>people of the glen are all become his clansmen, and his gentle lady</p>
<p>would be the patron saint of the district--if the republican</p>
<p>theology of Scotland could only admit saints among the elect.</p>
<p>Every year he sends trophies of game to his friends across the sea--</p>
<p>birds that are as toothsome and wild-flavoured as if they had not</p>
<p>been hatched under the tyranny of the game-laws.  He has a pleasant</p>
<p>trick of making them grateful to the imagination as well as to the</p>
<p>palate by packing them in heather.  I&#x27;ll warrant that Aaron&#x27;s rod</p>
<p>bore no bonnier blossoms than these stiff little bushes--and none</p>
<p>more magical.  For every time I take up a handful of them they</p>
<p>transport me to the Highlands, and send me tramping once more, with</p>
<p>knapsack and fishing-rod, over the braes and down the burns.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>BELL-HEATHER.</p>
<p>Some of my happiest meanderings in Scotland have been taken under</p>
<p>the lead of a book.  Indeed, for travel in a strange country there</p>
<p>can be no better courier.  Not a guide-book, I mean, but a real</p>
<p>book, and, by preference, a novel.</p>
<p>Fiction, like wine, tastes best in the place where it was grown.</p>
<p>And the scenery of a foreign land (including architecture, which is</p>
<p>artificial landscape) grows less dreamlike and unreal to our</p>
<p>perception when we people it with familiar characters from our</p>
<p>favourite novels.  Even on a first journey we feel ourselves among</p>
<p>old friends.  Thus to read Romola in Florence, and Les Miserables</p>
<p>in Paris, and Lorna Doone on Exmoor, and The Heart of Midlothian</p>
<p>in Edinburgh, and David Balfour in the Pass of Glencoe, and The</p>
<p>Pirate in the Shetland Isles, is to get a new sense of the</p>
<p>possibilities of life.  All these things have I done with much</p>
<p>inward contentment; and other things of like quality have I yet</p>
<p>in store; as, for example, the conjunction of The Bonnie Brier-Bush</p>
<p>with Drumtochty, and The Little Minister with Thrums, and The</p>
<p>Raiders with Galloway.  But I never expect to pass pleasanter</p>
<p>days than those I spent with A Princess of Thule among the Hebrides.</p>
<p>For then, to begin with, I was young; which is an unearned</p>
<p>increment of delight sure to be confiscated by the envious years</p>
<p>and never regained.  But even youth itself was not to be compared</p>
<p>with the exquisite felicity of being deeply and desperately in love</p>
<p>with Sheila, the clear-eyed heroine of that charming book.  In this</p>
<p>innocent passion my gray-haired comrades, Howard Crosby, the</p>
<p>Chancellor of the University of New York, and my father, an ex-</p>
<p>Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly, were ardent but</p>
<p>generous rivals.</p>
<p>How great is the joy and how fascinating the pursuit of such an</p>
<p>ethereal affection!  It enlarges the heart without embarrassing the</p>
<p>conscience.  It is a cup of pure gladness with no bitterness in its</p>
<p>dregs.  It spends the present moment with a free hand, and yet</p>
<p>leaves no undesirable mortgage upon the future.  King Arthur, the</p>
<p>founder of the Round Table, expressed a conviction, according to</p>
<p>Tennyson, that the most important element in a young knight&#x27;s</p>
<p>education is &quot;the maiden passion for a maid.&quot;  Surely the safest</p>
<p>form in which this course in the curriculum may be taken is by</p>
<p>falling in love with a girl in a book.  It is the only affair of</p>
<p>the kind into which a young fellow can enter without</p>
<p>responsibility, and out of which he can always emerge, when</p>
<p>necessary, without discredit.  And as for the old fellow who still</p>
<p>keeps up this education of the heart, and worships his heroine with</p>
<p>the ardour of a John Ridd and the fidelity of a Henry Esmond, I</p>
<p>maintain that he is exempt from all the penalties of declining</p>
<p>years.  The man who can love a girl in a book may be old, but never</p>
<p>aged.</p>
<p>So we sailed, lovers all three, among the Western Isles, and</p>
<p>whatever ship it was that carried us, her figurehead was always the</p>
<p>Princess Sheila.  Along the ruffled blue waters of the sounds and</p>
<p>lochs that wind among the roots of unpronounceable mountains, and</p>
<p>past the dark hills of Skye, and through the unnumbered flocks of</p>
<p>craggy islets where the sea-birds nest, the spell of the sweet</p>
<p>Highland maid drew us, and we were pilgrims to the Ultima Thule</p>
<p>where she lived and reigned.</p>
<p>The Lewis, with its tail-piece, the Harris, is quite a sizable</p>
<p>island to be appended to such a country as Scotland.  It is a</p>
<p>number of miles long, and another number of miles wide, and it has</p>
<p>a number of thousand inhabitants--I should say as many as three-</p>
<p>quarters of an inhabitant to the square mile--and the conditions of</p>
<p>agriculture and the fisheries are extremely interesting and</p>
<p>quarrelsome.  All these I duly studied at the time, and reported in</p>
<p>a series of intolerably dull letters to the newspaper which</p>
<p>supplied a financial basis for my sentimental journey.  They are</p>
<p>full of information; but I have been amused to note, after these</p>
<p>many years, how wide they steer of the true motive and interest of</p>
<p>the excursion.  There is not even a hint of Sheila in any of them.</p>
<p>Youth, after all, is a shamefaced and secretive season; like the</p>
<p>fringed polygala, it hides its real blossom underground.</p>
<p>It was Sheila&#x27;s dark-blue dress and sailor hat with the white</p>
<p>feather that we looked for as we loafed through the streets of</p>
<p>Stornoway, that quaint metropolis of the herring-trade, where</p>
<p>strings of fish alternated with boxes of flowers in the windows,</p>
<p>and handfuls of fish were spread upon the roofs to dry just as the</p>
<p>sliced apples are exposed upon the kitchen-sheds of New England in</p>
<p>September, and dark-haired women were carrying great creels of fish</p>
<p>on their shoulders, and groups of sunburned men were smoking among</p>
<p>the fishing-boats on the beach and talking about fish, and sea-</p>
<p>gulls were floating over the houses with their heads turning from</p>
<p>side to side and their bright eyes peering everywhere for</p>
<p>unconsidered trifles of fish, and the whole atmosphere of the</p>
<p>place, physical, mental, and moral, was pervaded with fish.  It was</p>
<p>Sheila&#x27;s soft, sing-song Highland speech that we heard through the</p>
<p>long, luminous twilight in the pauses of that friendly chat on the</p>
<p>balcony of the little inn where a good fortune brought us</p>
<p>acquainted with Sam Bough, the mellow Edinburgh painter.  It was</p>
<p>Sheila&#x27;s low sweet brow, and long black eyelashes, and tender blue</p>
<p>eyes, that we saw before us as we loitered over the open moorland,</p>
<p>a far-rolling sea of brown billows, reddened with patches of bell-</p>
<p>heather, and brightened here and there with little lakes lying wide</p>
<p>open to the sky.  And were not these peat-cutters, with the big</p>
<p>baskets on their backs, walking in silhouette along the ridges, the</p>
<p>people that Sheila loved and tried to help; and were not these</p>
<p>crofters&#x27; cottages with thatched roofs, like beehives, blending</p>
<p>almost imperceptibly with the landscape, the dwellings into which</p>
<p>she planned to introduce the luxury of windows; and were not these</p>
<p>Standing Stones of Callernish, huge tombstones of a vanished</p>
<p>religion, the roofless temple from which the Druids paid their</p>
<p>westernmost adoration to the setting sun as he sank into the</p>
<p>Atlantic--was not this the place where Sheila picked the bunch of</p>
<p>wild flowers and gave it to her lover?  There is nothing in</p>
<p>history, I am sure, half so real to us as some of the things in</p>
<p>fiction.  The influence of an event upon our character is little</p>
<p>affected by considerations as to whether or not it ever happened.</p>
<p>There were three churches in Stornoway, all Presbyterian, of</p>
<p>course, and therefore full of pious emulation.  The idea of</p>
<p>securing an American preacher for an August Sabbath seemed to fall</p>
<p>upon them simultaneously, and to offer the prospect of novelty</p>
<p>without too much danger.  The brethren of the U. P. congregation,</p>
<p>being a trifle more gleg than the others, arrived first at the inn,</p>
<p>and secured the promise of a morning sermon from Chancellor Howard</p>
<p>Crosby.  The session of the Free Kirk came in a body a little</p>
<p>later, and to them my father pledged himself for the evening sermon.</p>
<p>The senior elder of the Established Kirk, a snuff-taking man and</p>
<p>very deliberate, was the last to appear, and to his request for an</p>
<p>afternoon sermon there was nothing left to offer but the services</p>
<p>of the young probationer in theology.  I could see that it struck</p>
<p>him as a perilous adventure.  Questions about &quot;the fundamentals&quot;</p>
<p>glinted in his watery eye.  He crossed and uncrossed his legs with</p>
<p>solemnity, and blew his nose so frequently in a huge red silk</p>
<p>handkerchief that it seemed like a signal of danger.  At last he</p>
<p>unburdened himself of his hesitations.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah&#x27;m not saying that the young man will not be orthodox--ahem!</p>
<p>But ye know, sir, in the Kirk, we are not using hymns, but just the</p>
<p>pure Psawms of Daffit, in the meetrical fairsion.  And ye know,</p>
<p>sir, they are ferry tifficult in the reating, whatefer, for a young</p>
<p>man, and one that iss a stranger.  And if his father will just be</p>
<p>coming with him in the pulpit, to see that nothing iss said amiss,</p>
<p>that will be ferry comforting to the congregation.&quot;</p>
<p>So the dear governor swallowed his laughter gravely and went surety</p>
<p>for his son.  They appeared together in the church, a barnlike</p>
<p>edifice, with great galleries half-way between the floor and the</p>
<p>roof.  Still higher up, the pulpit stuck like a swallow&#x27;s nest</p>
<p>against the wall.  The two ministers climbed the precipitous stair</p>
<p>and found themselves in a box so narrow that one must stand</p>
<p>perforce, while the other sat upon the only seat.  In this &quot;ride</p>
<p>and tie&quot; fashion they went through the service.  When it was time</p>
<p>to preach, the young man dropped the doctrines as discreetly as</p>
<p>possible upon the upturned countenances beneath him.  I have</p>
<p>forgotten now what it was all about, but there was a quotation from</p>
<p>the Song of Solomon, ending with &quot;Sweet is thy voice, and thy</p>
<p>countenance is comely.&quot;  And when it came to that, the</p>
<p>probationer&#x27;s eyes (if the truth must be told) went searching</p>
<p>through that sea of faces for one that should be familiar to his</p>
<p>heart, and to which he might make a personal application of the</p>
<p>Scripture passage--even the face of Sheila.</p>
<p>There are rivers in the Lewis, at least two of them, and on one of</p>
<p>these we had the offer of a rod for a day&#x27;s fishing.  Accordingly</p>
<p>we cast lots, and the lot fell upon the youngest, and I went forth</p>
<p>with a tall, red-legged gillie, to try for my first salmon.  The</p>
<p>Whitewater came singing down out of the moorland into a rocky</p>
<p>valley, and there was a merry curl of air on the pools, and the</p>
<p>silver fish were leaping from the stream.  The gillie handled the</p>
<p>big rod as if it had been a fairy&#x27;s wand, but to me it was like a</p>
<p>giant&#x27;s spear.  It was a very different affair from fishing with</p>
<p>five ounces of split bamboo on a Long Island trout-pond.  The</p>
<p>monstrous fly, like an awkward bird, went fluttering everywhere but</p>
<p>in the right direction.  It was the mercy of Providence that</p>
<p>preserved the gillie&#x27;s life.  But he was very patient and</p>
<p>forbearing, leading me on from one pool to another, as I spoiled</p>
<p>the water and snatched the hook out of the mouth of rising fish,</p>
<p>until at last we found a salmon that knew even less about the</p>
<p>niceties of salmon-fishing than I did.  He seized the fly firmly,</p>
<p>before I could pull it away, and then, in a moment, I found myself</p>
<p>attached to a creature with the strength of a whale and the agility</p>
<p>of a flying-fish.  He led me rushing up and down the bank like a</p>
<p>madman.  He played on the surface like a whirlwind, and sulked at</p>
<p>the bottom like a stone.  He meditated, with ominous delay, in the</p>
<p>middle of the deepest pool, and then, darting across the river,</p>
<p>flung himself clean out of water and landed far up on the green</p>
<p>turf of the opposite shore.  My heart melted like a snowflake in</p>
<p>the sea, and I thought that I had lost him forever.  But he rolled</p>
<p>quietly back into the water with the hook still set in his nose.  A</p>
<p>few minutes afterwards I brought him within reach of the gaff, and</p>
<p>my first salmon was glittering on the grass beside me.</p>
<p>Then I remembered that William Black had described this very fish</p>
<p>in A Princess of Thule.  I pulled the book from my pocket, and,</p>
<p>lighting a pipe, sat down to read that delightful chapter over</p>
<p>again.  The breeze played softly down the valley.  The warm</p>
<p>sunlight was filled with the musical hum of insects and the murmur</p>
<p>of falling waters.  I thought how much pleasanter it would have</p>
<p>been to learn salmon-fishing, as Black&#x27;s hero did, from the Maid of</p>
<p>Borva, than from a red-headed gillie.  But, then, his salmon, after</p>
<p>leaping across the stream, got away; whereas mine was safe.  A man</p>
<p>cannot have everything in this world.  I picked a spray of rosy</p>
<p>bell-heather from the bank of the river, and pressed it between the</p>
<p>leaves of the book in memory of Sheila.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>COMMON HEATHER.</p>
<p>It is not half as far from Albany to Aberdeen as it is from New</p>
<p>York to London.  In fact, I venture to say that an American on foot</p>
<p>will find himself less a foreigner in Scotland than in any other</p>
<p>country in the Old World.  There is something warm and hospitable--</p>
<p>if he knew the language well enough he would call it couthy--in the</p>
<p>greeting that he gets from the shepherd on the moor, and the</p>
<p>conversation that he holds with the farmer&#x27;s wife in the stone</p>
<p>cottage, where he stops to ask for a drink of milk and a bit of</p>
<p>oat-cake.  He feels that there must be a drop of Scotch somewhere</p>
<p>in his mingled blood, or at least that the texture of his thought</p>
<p>and feelings has been partly woven on a Scottish loom--perhaps the</p>
<p>Shorter Catechism, or Robert Burns&#x27;s poems, or the romances of Sir</p>
<p>Walter Scott.  At all events, he is among a kindred and</p>
<p>comprehending people.  They do not speak English in the same way</p>
<p>that he does--through the nose---but they think very much more in</p>
<p>his mental dialect than the English do.  They are independent and</p>
<p>wide awake, curious and full of personal interest.  The wayside</p>
<p>mind in Inverness or Perth runs more to muscle and less to fat, has</p>
<p>more active vanity and less passive pride, is more inquisitive and</p>
<p>excitable and sympathetic--in short, to use a symbolist&#x27;s</p>
<p>description, it is more apt to be red-headed--than in Surrey or</p>
<p>Somerset.  Scotchmen ask more questions about America, but fewer</p>
<p>foolish ones.  You will never hear them inquiring whether there is</p>
<p>any good bear-hunting in the neighbourhood of Boston, or whether</p>
<p>Shakespeare is much read in the States.  They have a healthy</p>
<p>respect for our institutions, and have quite forgiven (if, indeed,</p>
<p>they ever resented) that little affair in 1776.  They are all born</p>
<p>Liberals.  When a Scotchman says he is a Conservative, it only</p>
<p>means that he is a Liberal with hesitations.</p>
<p>And yet in North Britain the American pedestrian will not find that</p>
<p>amused and somewhat condescending toleration for his peculiarities,</p>
<p>that placid willingness to make the best of all his vagaries of</p>
<p>speech and conduct, that he finds in South Britain.  In an English</p>
<p>town you may do pretty much what you like on a Sunday, even to the</p>
<p>extent of wearing a billycock hat to church, and people will put up</p>
<p>with it from a countryman of Buffalo Bill and the Wild West Show.</p>
<p>But in a Scotch village, if you whistle in the street on a Lord&#x27;s</p>
<p>Day, though it be a Moody and Sankey tune, you will be likely to</p>
<p>get, as I did, an admonition from some long-legged, grizzled elder:</p>
<p>&quot;Young man, do ye no ken it&#x27;s the Sawbath Day?&quot;</p>
<p>I recognised the reproof of the righteous, an excellent oil which</p>
<p>doth not break the head, and took it gratefully at the old man&#x27;s</p>
<p>hands.  For did it not prove that he regarded me as a man and a</p>
<p>brother, a creature capable of being civilised and saved?</p>
<p>It was in the gray town of Dingwall that I had this bit of pleasant</p>
<p>correction, as I was on the way to a fishing tramp through</p>
<p>Sutherlandshire.  This northwest corner of Great Britain is the</p>
<p>best place in the whole island for a modest and impecunious angler.</p>
<p>There are, or there were a few years ago, wild lochs and streams</p>
<p>which are still practically free, and a man who is content with</p>
<p>small things can pick up some very pretty sport from the highland</p>
<p>inns, and make a good basket of memorable experiences every week.</p>
<p>The inn at Lairg, overlooking the narrow waters of Loch Shin, was</p>
<p>embowered in honeysuckles, and full of creature comfort.  But there</p>
<p>were too many other men with rods there to suit my taste.  &quot;The</p>
<p>feesh in this loch,&quot; said the boatman, &quot;iss not so numerous ass the</p>
<p>feeshermen, but more wise.  There iss not one of them that hass not</p>
<p>felt the hook, and they know ferry well what side of the fly has</p>
<p>the forkit tail.&quot;</p>
<p>At Altnaharra, in the shadow of Ben Clebrig, there was a cozy</p>
<p>little house with good fare, and abundant trout-fishing in Loch</p>
<p>Naver and Loch Meadie.  It was there that I fell in with a</p>
<p>wandering pearl-peddler who gathered his wares from the mussels in</p>
<p>the moorland streams.  They were not of the finest quality, these</p>
<p>Scotch pearls, but they had pretty, changeable colours of pink and</p>
<p>blue upon them, like the iridescent light that plays over the</p>
<p>heather in the long northern evenings.  I thought it must be a hard</p>
<p>life for the man, wading day after day in the ice-cold water, and</p>
<p>groping among the coggly, sliddery stones for the shellfish, and</p>
<p>cracking open perhaps a thousand before he could find one pearl.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yess,&quot; said be, &quot;and it iss not an easy life, and I am not</p>
<p>saying that it will be so warm and dry ass liffing in a rich house.</p>
<p>But it iss the life that I am fit for, and I hef my own time and my</p>
<p>thoughts to mysel&#x27;, and that is a ferry goot thing; and then, sir,</p>
<p>I haf found the Pearl of Great Price, and I think upon that day and</p>
<p>night.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the black, shattered peaks of Ben Laoghal, where I saw an</p>
<p>eagle poising day after day as if some invisible centripetal force</p>
<p>bound him forever to that small circle of air, there was a loch</p>
<p>with plenty of brown trout and a few salmo ferox; and down at</p>
<p>Tongue there was a little river where the sea-trout sometimes come</p>
<p>up with the tide.</p>
<p>Here I found myself upon the north coast, and took the road</p>
<p>eastward between the mountains and the sea.  It was a beautiful</p>
<p>region of desolation.  There were rocky glens cutting across the</p>
<p>road, and occasionally a brawling stream ran down to the salt</p>
<p>water, breaking the line of cliffs with a little bay and a half-</p>
<p>moon of yellow sand.  The heather covered all the hills.  There</p>
<p>were no trees, and but few houses.  The chief signs of human labour</p>
<p>were the rounded piles of peat, and the square cuttings in the moor</p>
<p>marking the places where the subterranean wood-choppers had</p>
<p>gathered their harvests.  The long straths were once cultivated,</p>
<p>and every patch of arable land had its group of cottages full of</p>
<p>children.  The human harvest has always been the richest and most</p>
<p>abundant that is raised in the Highlands; but unfortunately the</p>
<p>supply exceeded the demand; and so the crofters were evicted, and</p>
<p>great flocks of sheep were put in possession of the land; and now</p>
<p>the sheep-pastures have been changed into deer-forests; and far and</p>
<p>wide along the valleys and across the hills there is not a trace of</p>
<p>habitation, except the heaps of stones and the clumps of straggling</p>
<p>bushes which mark the sites of lost homes.  But what is one</p>
<p>country&#x27;s loss is another country&#x27;s gain.  Canada and the United</p>
<p>States are infinitely the richer for the tough, strong, fearless,</p>
<p>honest men that were dispersed from these lonely straths to make</p>
<p>new homes across the sea.</p>
<p>It was after sundown when I reached the straggling village of</p>
<p>Melvich, and the long day&#x27;s journey had left me weary.  But the</p>
<p>inn, with its red-curtained windows, looked bright and reassuring.</p>
<p>Thoughts of dinner and a good bed comforted my spirit--prematurely.</p>
<p>For the inn was full.  There were but five bedrooms and two</p>
<p>parlours.  The gentlemen who had the neighbouring shootings</p>
<p>occupied three bedrooms and a parlour; the other two bedrooms had</p>
<p>just been taken by the English fishermen who had passed me in the</p>
<p>road an hour ago in the mail-coach (oh! why had I not suspected</p>
<p>that treacherous vehicle?); and the landlord and his wife assured</p>
<p>me, with equal firmness and sympathy, that there was not another</p>
<p>cot or pair of blankets in the house.  I believed them, and was</p>
<p>sinking into despair when Sandy M&#x27;Kaye appeared on the scene as my</p>
<p>angel of deliverance.  Sandy was a small, withered, wiry man,</p>
<p>dressed in rusty gray, with an immense white collar thrusting out</p>
<p>its points on either side of his chin, and a black stock climbing</p>
<p>over the top of it.  I guessed from his speech that he had once</p>
<p>lived in the lowlands.  He had hoped to be engaged as a gillie by</p>
<p>the shooting party, but had been disappointed.  He had wanted to be</p>
<p>taken by the English fishermen, but another and younger man had</p>
<p>stepped in before him.  Now Sandy saw in me his Predestinated</p>
<p>Opportunity, and had no idea of letting it post up the road that</p>
<p>night to the next village.  He cleared his throat respectfully and</p>
<p>cut into the conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah&#x27;m thinkin&#x27; the gentleman micht find a coomfortaible lodgin&#x27; wi&#x27;</p>
<p>the weedow Macphairson a wee bittie doon the road.  Her dochter is</p>
<p>awa&#x27; in Ameriky, an&#x27; the room is a verra fine room, an&#x27; it is a</p>
<p>peety to hae it stannin&#x27; idle, an&#x27; ye wudna mind the few steps to</p>
<p>and fro tae yir meals here, sir, wud ye?  An&#x27; if ye &#x27;ill gang wi&#x27;</p>
<p>me efter dinner, &#x27;a &#x27;ll be prood to shoo ye the hoose.&quot;</p>
<p>So, after a good dinner with the English fishermen, Sandy piloted</p>
<p>me down the road through the thickening dusk.  I remember a hoodie</p>
<p>crow flew close behind us with a choking, ghostly cough that</p>
<p>startled me.  The Macpherson cottage was a snug little house of</p>
<p>stone, with fuchsias and roses growing in the front yard: and the</p>
<p>widow was a douce old lady, with a face like a winter apple in the</p>
<p>month of April, wrinkled, but still rosy.  She was a little</p>
<p>doubtful about entertaining strangers, but when she heard I was</p>
<p>from America she opened the doors of her house and her heart.  And</p>
<p>when, by a subtle cross examination that would have been a credit</p>
<p>to the wife of a Connecticut deacon, she discovered the fact that</p>
<p>her lodger was a minister, she did two things, with equal and</p>
<p>immediate fervour; she brought out the big Bible and asked him to</p>
<p>conduct evening worship, and she produced a bottle of old Glenlivet</p>
<p>and begged him to &quot;guard against takkin&#x27; cauld by takkin&#x27; a glass</p>
<p>of speerits.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a very pleasant fortnight at Melvich.  Mistress Macpherson</p>
<p>was so motherly that &quot;takkin&#x27; cauld&quot; was reduced to a permanent</p>
<p>impossibility.  The other men at the inn proved to be very</p>
<p>companionable fellows, quite different from the monsters of</p>
<p>insolence that my anger had imagined in the moment of</p>
<p>disappointment.  The shooting party kept the table abundantly</p>
<p>supplied with grouse and hares and highland venison; and there was</p>
<p>a piper to march up and down before the window and play while we</p>
<p>ate dinner--a very complimentary and disquieting performance.  But</p>
<p>there are many occasions in life when pride can be entertained only</p>
<p>at the expense of comfort.</p>
<p>Of course Sandy was my gillie.  It was a fine sight to see him</p>
<p>exhibiting the tiny American trout-rod, tied with silk ribbons in</p>
<p>its delicate case, to the other gillies and exulting over them.</p>
<p>Every morning he would lead me away through the heather to some</p>
<p>lonely loch on the shoulders of the hills, from which we could look</p>
<p>down upon the Northern Sea and the blue Orkney Isles far away across</p>
<p>the Pentland Firth.  Sometimes we would find a loch with a boat on</p>
<p>it, and drift up and down, casting along the shores.  Sometimes,</p>
<p>in spite of Sandy&#x27;s confident predictions, no boat could be found,</p>
<p>and then I must put on the Mackintosh trousers and wade out over my</p>
<p>hips into the water, and circumambulate the pond, throwing the flies</p>
<p>as far as possible toward the middle, and feeling my way carefully</p>
<p>along the bottom with the long net-handle, while Sandy danced on</p>
<p>the bank in an agony of apprehension lest his Predestinated Opportunity</p>
<p>should step into a deep hole and be drowned.  It was a curious fact</p>
<p>in natural history that on the lochs with boats the trout were in</p>
<p>the shallow water, but in the boatless lochs they were away out in</p>
<p>the depths.  &quot;Juist the total depraivity o&#x27; troots,&quot; said Sandy,</p>
<p>&quot;an&#x27; terrible fateegin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>Sandy had an aversion to commit himself to definite statements on</p>
<p>any subject not theological.  If you asked him how long the</p>
<p>morning&#x27;s tramp would be, it was &quot;no verra long, juist a bit ayant</p>
<p>the hull yonner.&quot;  And if, at the end of the seventh mile, you</p>
<p>complained that it was much too far, he would never do more than</p>
<p>admit that &quot;it micht be shorter.&quot;  If you called him to rejoice</p>
<p>over a trout that weighed close upon two pounds, he allowed that it</p>
<p>was &quot;no bad--but there&#x27;s bigger anes i&#x27; the loch gin we cud but</p>
<p>wile them oot.&quot;  And at lunch-time, when we turned out a full</p>
<p>basket of shining fish on the heather, the most that he would say,</p>
<p>while his eyes snapped with joy and pride, was, &quot;Aweel, we canna</p>
<p>complain, the day.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he would gather an armful of dried heather-stems for kindling,</p>
<p>and dig out a few roots and crooked limbs of the long-vanished</p>
<p>forest from the dry, brown, peaty soil, and make our campfire of</p>
<p>prehistoric wood--just for the pleasant, homelike look of the</p>
<p>blaze--and sit down beside it to eat our lunch.  Heat is the least</p>
<p>of the benefits that man gets from fire.  It is the sign of</p>
<p>cheerfulness and good comradeship.  I would not willingly satisfy</p>
<p>my hunger, even in a summer nooning, without a little flame burning</p>
<p>on a rustic altar to consecrate and enliven the feast.  When the</p>
<p>bread and cheese were finished and the pipes were filled with</p>
<p>Virginia tobacco, Sandy would begin to tell me, very solemnly and</p>
<p>respectfully, about the mistakes I had made in the fishing that</p>
<p>day, and mourn over the fact that the largest fish had not been</p>
<p>hooked.  There was a strong strain of pessimism in Sandy, and he</p>
<p>enjoyed this part of the sport immensely.</p>
<p>But he was at his best in the walk home through the lingering</p>
<p>twilight, when the murmur of the sea trembled through the air, and</p>
<p>the incense of burning peat floated up from the cottages, and the</p>
<p>stars blossomed one by one in the pale-green sky.  Then Sandy</p>
<p>dandered on at his ease down the hills, and discoursed of things in</p>
<p>heaven and earth.  He was an unconscious follower of the theology</p>
<p>of the Reverend John Jasper, of Richmond, Virginia, and rejected</p>
<p>the Copernican theory of the universe as inconsistent with the</p>
<p>history of Joshua.  &quot;Gin the sun doesna muve,&quot; said he, &quot;what for</p>
<p>wad Joshua be tellin&#x27; him to stond steel?  &#x27;A wad suner beleeve</p>
<p>there was a mistak&#x27; in the veesible heevens than ae fault in the</p>
<p>Guid Buik.&quot;  Whereupon we held long discourse of astronomy and</p>
<p>inspiration; but Sandy concluded it with a philosophic word which</p>
<p>left little to be said: &quot;Aweel, yon teelescope is a wonnerful</p>
<p>deescovery; but &#x27;a dinna think the less o&#x27; the Baible.&quot;</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>WHITE HEATHER.</p>
<p>Memory is a capricious and arbitrary creature.  You never can tell</p>
<p>what pebble she will pick up from the shore of life to keep among</p>
<p>her treasures, or what inconspicuous flower of the field she will</p>
<p>preserve as the symbol of</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">&quot;Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.&quot;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>She has her own scale of values for these mementos, and knows</p>
<p>nothing of the market price of precious stones or the costly</p>
<p>splendour of rare orchids.  The thing that pleases her is the thing</p>
<p>that she will hold fast.  And yet I do not doubt that the most</p>
<p>important things are always the best remembered; only we must learn</p>
<p>that the real importance of what we see and hear in the world is to</p>
<p>be measured at last by its meaning, its significance, its intimacy</p>
<p>with the heart of our heart and the life of our life.  And when we</p>
<p>find a little token of the past very safely and imperishably kept</p>
<p>among our recollections, we must believe that memory has made no</p>
<p>mistake.  It is because that little thing has entered into our</p>
<p>experience most deeply, that it stays with us and we cannot lose</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>You have half forgotten many a famous scene that you travelled far</p>
<p>to look upon.  You cannot clearly recall the sublime peak of Mont</p>
<p>Blanc, the roaring curve of Niagara, the vast dome of St. Peter&#x27;s.</p>
<p>The music of Patti&#x27;s crystalline voice has left no distinct echo in</p>
<p>your remembrance, and the blossoming of the century-plant is dimmer</p>
<p>than the shadow of a dream.  But there is a nameless valley among</p>
<p>the hills where you can still trace every curve of the stream, and</p>
<p>see the foam-bells floating on the pool below the bridge, and the</p>
<p>long moss wavering in the current.  There is a rustic song of a</p>
<p>girl passing through the fields at sunset, that still repeats its</p>
<p>far-off cadence in your listening ears.  There is a small flower</p>
<p>trembling on its stem in some hidden nook beneath the open sky,</p>
<p>that never withers through all the changing years; the wind passes</p>
<p>over it, but it is not gone--it abides forever in your soul, an</p>
<p>amaranthine blossom of beauty and truth.</p>
<p>White heather is not an easy flower to find.  You may look for it</p>
<p>among the highlands for a day without success.  And when it is</p>
<p>discovered, there is little outward charm to commend it.  It lacks</p>
<p>the grace of the dainty bells that hang so abundantly from the</p>
<p>Erica Tetralix, and the pink glow of the innumerable blossoms of</p>
<p>the common heather.  But then it is a symbol.  It is the Scotch</p>
<p>Edelweiss.  It means sincere affection, and unselfish love, and</p>
<p>tender wishes as pure as prayers.  I shall always remember the</p>
<p>evening when I found the white heather on the moorland above Glen</p>
<p>Ericht.  Or, rather, it was not I that found it (for I have little</p>
<p>luck in the discovery of good omens, and have never plucked a four-</p>
<p>leaved clover in my life), but my companion, the gentle Mistress of</p>
<p>the Glen, whose hair was as white as the tiny blossoms, and yet</p>
<p>whose eyes were far quicker than mine to see and name every flower</p>
<p>that bloomed in those lofty, widespread fields.</p>
<p>Ericht Water is formed by the marriage of two streams, one flowing</p>
<p>out of Strath Ardle and the other descending from Cairn Gowar</p>
<p>through the long, lonely Pass of Glenshee.  The Ericht begins at</p>
<p>the bridge of Cally, and its placid, beautiful glen, unmarred by</p>
<p>railway or factory, reaches almost down to Blairgowrie.  On the</p>
<p>southern bank, but far above the water, runs the high road to</p>
<p>Braemar and the Linn of Dee.  On the other side of the river,</p>
<p>nestling among the trees, is the low white manor-house,</p>

<p>It is a place where one who had been wearied and perchance sore</p>
<p>wounded in the battle of life might well desire to be carried, as</p>
<p>Arthur to the island valley of Avilion, for rest and healing.</p>
<p>I have no thought of renewing the conflicts and cares that filled</p>
<p>that summer with sorrow.  There were fightings without and fears</p>
<p>within; there was the surrender of an enterprise that had been</p>
<p>cherished since boyhood, and the bitter sense of irremediable</p>
<p>weakness that follows such a reverse; there was a touch of that</p>
<p>wrath with those we love, which, as Coleridge says,</p>

<p>flying across the sea from these troubles, I had found my old</p>
<p>comrade of merrier days sentenced to death, and caught but a brief</p>
<p>glimpse of his pale, brave face as he went away into exile.  At</p>
<p>such a time the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are</p>
<p>darkened, and the clouds return after rain.  But through those</p>
<p>clouds the Mistress of the Glen came to meet me--a stranger till</p>
<p>then, but an appointed friend, a minister of needed grace, an angel</p>
<p>of quiet comfort.  The thick mists of rebellion, mistrust, and</p>
<p>despair have long since rolled away, and against the background of</p>
<p>the hills her figure stands out clearly, dressed in the fashion of</p>
<p>fifty years ago, with the snowy hair gathered close beneath her</p>
<p>widow&#x27;s cap, and a spray of white heather in her outstretched hand.</p>
<p>There were no other guests in the house by the river during those</p>
<p>still days in the noontide hush of midsummer.  Every morning, while</p>
<p>the Mistress was busied with her household cares and letters, I</p>
<p>would be out in the fields hearing the lark sing, and watching the</p>
<p>rabbits as they ran to and fro, scattering the dew from the grass</p>
<p>in a glittering spray.  Or perhaps I would be angling down the</p>
<p>river, with the swift pressure of the water around my knees, and an</p>
<p>inarticulate current of cooling thoughts flowing on and on through</p>
<p>my brain like the murmur of the stream.  Every afternoon there were</p>
<p>long walks with the Mistress in the old-fashioned garden, where</p>
<p>wonderful roses were blooming; or through the dark, fir-shaded den</p>
<p>where the wild burn dropped down to join the river; or out upon the</p>
<p>high moor under the waning orange sunset.  Every night there were</p>
<p>luminous and restful talks beside the open fire in the library,</p>
<p>when the words came clear and calm from the heart, unperturbed by</p>
<p>the vain desire of saying brilliant things, which turns so much of</p>
<p>our conversation into a combat of wits instead of an interchange of</p>
<p>thoughts.  Talk like this is possible only between two.  The</p>
<p>arrival of a third person sets the lists for a tournament, and</p>
<p>offers the prize for a verbal victory.  But where there are only</p>
<p>two, the armour is laid aside, and there is no call to thrust and</p>
<p>parry.</p>
<p>One of the two should be a good listener, sympathetic, but not</p>
<p>silent, giving confidence in order to attract it--and of this art a</p>
<p>woman is the best master.  But its finest secrets do not come to</p>
<p>her until she has passed beyond the uncertain season of compliments</p>
<p>and conquests, and entered into the serenity of a tranquil age.</p>
<p>What is this foolish thing that men say about the impossibility of</p>
<p>true intimacy and converse between the young and the old?</p>
<p>Hamerton, for example, in his book on Human Intercourse, would have</p>
<p>us believe that a difference in years is a barrier between hearts.</p>
<p>For my part, I have more often found it an open door, and a</p>
<p>security of generous and tolerant welcome for the young soldier,</p>
<p>who comes in tired and dusty from the battle-field, to tell his</p>
<p>story of defeat or victory in the garden of still thoughts where</p>
<p>old age is resting in the peace of honourable discharge.  I like</p>
<p>what Robert Louis Stevenson says about it in his essay on Talk and</p>
<p>Talkers.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only is the presence of the aged in itself remedial, but their</p>
<p>minds are stored with antidotes, wisdom&#x27;s simples, plain</p>
<p>considerations overlooked by youth.  They have matter to</p>
<p>communicate, be they never so stupid.  Their talk is not merely</p>
<p>literature, it is great literature; classic by virtue of the</p>
<p>speaker&#x27;s detachment; studded, like a book of travel, with things</p>
<p>we should not otherwise have learnt. . . where youth agrees with</p>
<p>age, not where they differ, wisdom lies; and it is when the young</p>
<p>disciple finds his heart to beat in tune with his gray-haired</p>
<p>teacher&#x27;s that a lesson may be learned.&quot;</p>
<p>The conversation of the Mistress of the Glen shone like the light</p>
<p>and distilled like the dew, not only by virtue of what she said,</p>
<p>but still more by virtue of what she was.  Her face was a good</p>
<p>counsel against discouragement; and the cheerful quietude of her</p>
<p>demeanour was a rebuke to all rebellious, cowardly, and</p>
<p>discontented thoughts.  It was not the striking novelty or</p>
<p>profundity of her commentary on life that made it memorable, it was</p>
<p>simply the truth of what she said and the gentleness with which she</p>
<p>said it.  Epigrams are worth little for guidance to the perplexed,</p>
<p>and less for comfort to the wounded.  But the plain, homely sayings</p>
<p>which come from a soul that has learned the lesson of patient</p>
<p>courage in the school of real experience, fall upon the wound like</p>
<p>drops of balsam, and like a soothing lotion up on the eyes smarting</p>
<p>and blinded with passion.</p>
<p>She spoke of those who had walked with her long ago in her garden,</p>
<p>and for whose sake, now that they had all gone into the world of</p>
<p>light, every flower was doubly dear.  Would it be a true proof of</p>
<p>loyalty to them if she lived gloomily or despondently because they</p>
<p>were away?  She spoke of the duty of being ready to welcome</p>
<p>happiness as well as to endure pain, and of the strength that</p>
<p>endurance wins by being grateful for small daily joys, like the</p>
<p>evening light, and the smell of roses, and the singing of birds.</p>
<p>She spoke of the faith that rests on the Unseen Wisdom and Love</p>
<p>like a child on its mother&#x27;s breast, and of the melting away of</p>
<p>doubts in the warmth of an effort to do some good in the world.</p>
<p>And if that effort has conflict, and adventure, and confused noise,</p>
<p>and mistakes, and even defeats mingled with it, in the stormy years</p>
<p>of youth, is not that to be expected?  The burn roars and leaps in</p>
<p>the den; the stream chafes and frets through the rapids of the</p>
<p>glen; the river does not grow calm and smooth until it nears the</p>
<p>sea.  Courage is a virtue that the young cannot spare; to lose it</p>
<p>is to grow old before the time; it is better to make a thousand</p>
<p>mistakes and suffer a thousand reverses than to refuse the battle.</p>
<p>Resignation is the final courage of old age; it arrives in its own</p>
<p>season; and it is a good day when it comes to us.  Then there are</p>
<p>no more disappointments; for we have learned that it is even better</p>
<p>to desire the things that we have than to have the things that we</p>
<p>desire.  And is not the best of all our hopes--the hope of</p>
<p>immortality--always before us?  How can we be dull or heavy while</p>
<p>we have that new experience to look forward to?  It will be the</p>
<p>most joyful of all our travels and adventures.  It will bring us</p>
<p>our best acquaintances and friendships.  But there is only one way</p>
<p>to get ready for immortality, and that is to love this life, and</p>
<p>live it as bravely and cheerfully and faithfully as we can.</p>
<p>So my gentle teacher with the silver hair showed me the treasures</p>
<p>of her ancient, simple faith; and I felt that no sermons, nor</p>
<p>books, nor arguments can strengthen the doubting heart so deeply as</p>
<p>just to come into touch with a soul which has proved the truth of</p>
<p>that plain religion whose highest philosophy is &quot;Trust in the Lord</p>
<p>and do good.&quot;  At the end of the evening the household was gathered</p>
<p>for prayers, and the Mistress kneeled among her servants, leading</p>
<p>them, in her soft Scottish accent, through the old familiar</p>
<p>petitions for pardon for the errors of the day, and refreshing</p>
<p>sleep through the night and strength for the morrow.  It is good to</p>
<p>be in a land where the people are not ashamed to pray.  I have</p>
<p>shared the blessing of Catholics at their table in lowly huts among</p>
<p>the mountains of the Tyrol, and knelt with Covenanters at their</p>
<p>household altar in the glens of Scotland; and all around the world,</p>
<p>where the spirit of prayer is, there is peace.  The genius of the</p>
<p>Scotch has made many contributions to literature, but none I think,</p>
<p>more precious, and none that comes closer to the heart, than the</p>
<p>prayer which Robert Louis Stevenson wrote for his family in distant</p>
<p>Samoa, the night before he died:--</p>
<p>&quot;We beseech thee, Lord, to behold us with favour, folk of many</p>
<p>families and nations, gathered together in the peace of this roof:</p>
<p>weak men and women subsisting under the covert of thy patience.  Be</p>
<p>patient still; suffer us yet a while longer--with our broken</p>
<p>promises of good, with our idle endeavours against evil--suffer us</p>
<p>a while longer to endure, and (if it may be) help us to do better.</p>
<p>Bless to us our extraordinary mercies; if the day come when these</p>
<p>must be taken, have us play the man under affliction.  Be with our</p>
<p>friends, be with ourselves.  Go with each of us to rest; if any</p>
<p>awake, temper to them the dark hours of watching; and when the day</p>
<p>returns to us--our sun and comforter--call us with morning faces,</p>
<p>eager to labour, eager to be happy, if happiness shall be our</p>
<p>portion, and, if the day be marked to sorrow, strong to endure it.</p>
<p>We thank thee and praise thee; and, in the words of Him to whom</p>
<p>this day is sacred, close our oblation.&quot;</p>
<p>The man who made that kindly human prayer knew the meaning of white</p>
<p>heather.  And I dare to hope that I too have known something of its</p>
<p>meaning, since that evening when the Mistress of the Glen picked</p>
<p>the spray and gave it to me on the lonely moor.  &quot;And now,&quot; she</p>
<p>said, &quot;you will be going home across the sea; and you have been</p>
<p>welcome here, but it is time that you should go, for there is the</p>
<p>place where your real duties and troubles and joys are waiting for</p>
<p>you.  And if you have left any misunderstandings behind you, you</p>
<p>will try to clear them up; and if there have been any quarrels, you</p>
<p>will heal them.  Carry this little flower with you.  It&#x27;s not the</p>
<p>bonniest blossom in Scotland, but it&#x27;s the dearest, for the message</p>
<p>that it brings.  And you will remember that love is not</p>
<p>getting, but giving; not a wild dream of pleasure, and a madness of</p>
<p>desire--oh no, love is not that--it is goodness, and honour, and</p>
<p>peace, and pure living--yes, love is that; and it is the best thing</p>
<p>in the world, and the thing that lives longest.  And that is what I</p>
<p>am wishing for you and yours with this bit of white heather.&quot;</p>

<p>THE RISTIGOUCHE FROM A HORSE-YACHT</p>
<p>Dr. Paley was ardently attached to this amusement; so much so that</p>
<p>when the Bishop of Durham inquired of him when one of his most</p>
<p>important works would be finished, he said, with great simplicity</p>
<p>and good humour, &#x27;My Lord, I shall work steadily at it when the</p>
<p>fly-fishing season is over.&#x27;--SIR HUMPHRY DAVY: Salmonia.</p>
<p>The boundary line between the Province of Quebec and New Brunswick,</p>
<p>for a considerable part of its course, resembles the name of the</p>
<p>poet Keats; it is &quot;writ in water.&quot;  But like his fame, it is water</p>
<p>that never fails,--the limpid current of the river Ristigouche.</p>
<p>The railway crawls over it on a long bridge at Metapedia, and you</p>
<p>are dropped in the darkness somewhere between midnight and dawn.</p>
<p>When you open your window-shutters the next morning, you see that</p>
<p>the village is a disconsolate hamlet, scattered along the track as</p>
<p>if it had been shaken by chance from an open freight-car; it</p>
<p>consists of twenty houses, three shops, and a discouraged church</p>
<p>perched upon a little hillock like a solitary mourner on the</p>
<p>anxious seat.  The one comfortable and prosperous feature in the</p>
<p>countenance of Metapedia is the house of the Ristigouche Salmon</p>
<p>Club--an old-fashioned mansion, with broad, white piazza, looking</p>
<p>over rich meadow-lands.  Here it was that I found my friend</p>
<p>Favonius, president of solemn societies, pillar of church and</p>
<p>state, ingenuously arrayed in gray knickerbockers, a flannel shirt,</p>
<p>and a soft hat, waiting to take me on his horse-yacht for a voyage</p>
<p>up the river.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a horse-yacht?  Sometimes it is called a scow;</p>
<p>but that sounds common.  Sometimes it is called a house-boat; but</p>
<p>that is too English.  What does it profit a man to have a whole</p>
<p>dictionary full of language at his service, unless he can invent a</p>
<p>new and suggestive name for his friend&#x27;s pleasure-craft?  The</p>
<p>foundation of the horse-yacht--if a thing that floats may be called</p>
<p>fundamental--is a flat-bottomed boat, some fifty feet long and ten</p>
<p>feet wide, with a draft of about eight inches.  The deck is open</p>
<p>for fifteen feet aft of the place where the bowsprit ought to be;</p>
<p>behind that it is completely covered by a house, cabin, cottage, or</p>
<p>whatever you choose to call it, with straight sides and a peaked</p>
<p>roof of a very early Gothic pattern.  Looking in at the door you</p>
<p>see, first of all, two cots, one on either side of the passage;</p>
<p>then an open space with a dining-table, a stove, and some chairs;</p>
<p>beyond that a pantry with shelves, and a great chest for</p>
<p>provisions.  A door at the back opens into the kitchen, and from</p>
<p>that another door opens into a sleeping-room for the boatmen.  A</p>
<p>huge wooden tiller curves over the stern of the boat, and the</p>
<p>helmsman stands upon the kitchen-roof.  Two canoes are floating</p>
<p>behind, holding back, at the end of their long tow-ropes, as if</p>
<p>reluctant to follow so clumsy a leader.  This is an accurate</p>
<p>description of the horse-yacht.  If necessary it could be sworn to</p>
<p>before a notary public.  But I am perfectly sure that you might</p>
<p>read this page through without skipping a word, and if you had</p>
<p>never seen the creature with your own eyes, you would have no idea</p>
<p>how absurd it looks and how comfortable it is.</p>
<p>While we were stowing away our trunks and bags under the cots, and</p>
<p>making an equitable division of the hooks upon the walls, the</p>
<p>motive power of the yacht stood patiently upon the shore, stamping</p>
<p>a hoof, now and then, or shaking a shaggy head in mild protest</p>
<p>against the flies.  Three more pessimistic-looking horses I never</p>
<p>saw.  They were harnessed abreast, and fastened by a prodigious</p>
<p>tow-rope to a short post in the middle of the forward deck.  Their</p>
<p>driver was a truculent, brigandish, bearded old fellow in long</p>
<p>boots, a blue flannel shirt, and a black sombrero.  He sat upon the</p>
<p>middle horse, and some wild instinct of colour had made him tie a</p>
<p>big red handkerchief around his shoulders, so that the eye of the</p>
<p>beholder took delight in him.  He posed like a bold, bad robber-</p>
<p>chief.  But in point of fact I believe he was the mildest and most</p>
<p>inoffensive of men.  We never heard him say anything except at a</p>
<p>distance, to his horses, and we did not inquire what that was.</p>
<p>Well, as I have said, we were haggling courteously over those hooks</p>
<p>in the cabin, when the boat gave a lurch.  The bow swung out into</p>
<p>the stream.  There was a scrambling and clattering of iron horse-</p>
<p>shoes on the rough shingle of the bank; and when we looked out of</p>
<p>doors, our house was moving up the river with the boat under it.</p>
<p>The Ristigouche is a noble stream, stately and swift and strong.</p>
<p>It rises among the dense forests in the northern part of New</p>
<p>Brunswick--a moist upland region, of never-failing springs and</p>
<p>innumerous lakes--and pours a flood of clear, cold water one</p>
<p>hundred and fifty miles northward and eastward through the hills</p>
<p>into the head of the Bay of Chaleurs.  There are no falls in its</p>
<p>course, but rapids everywhere.  It is steadfast but not impetuous,</p>
<p>quick but not turbulent, resolute and eager in its desire to get to</p>
<p>the sea, like the life of a man who has a purpose</p>

<p>The wonder is where all the water comes from.  But the river is fed</p>
<p>by more than six thousand square miles of territory.  From both</p>
<p>sides the little brooks come dashing in with their supply.  At</p>
<p>intervals a larger stream, reaching away back among the mountains</p>
<p>like a hand with many fingers to gather</p>

<p>delivers its generous offering to the main current.</p>
<p>The names of the chief tributaries of the Ristigouche are curious.</p>
<p>There is the headstrong Metapedia, and the crooked Upsalquitch, and</p>
<p>the Patapedia, and the Quatawamkedgwick.  These are words at which</p>
<p>the tongue balks at first, but you soon grow used to them and learn</p>
<p>to take anything of five syllables with a rush, as a hunter takes a</p>
<p>five-barred gate, trusting to fortune that you will come down with</p>
<p>the accent in the right place.</p>
<p>For six or seven miles above Metapedia the river has a breadth of</p>
<p>about two hundred yards, and the valley slopes back rather gently</p>
<p>to the mountains on either side.  There is a good deal of</p>
<p>cultivated land, and scattered farm-houses appear.  The soil is</p>
<p>excellent.  But it is like a pearl cast before an obstinate,</p>
<p>unfriendly climate.  Late frosts prolong the winter.  Early frosts</p>
<p>curtail the summer.  The only safe crops are grass, oats, and</p>
<p>potatoes.  And for half the year all the cattle must be housed and</p>
<p>fed to keep them alive.  This lends a melancholy aspect to</p>
<p>agriculture.  Most of the farmers look as if they had never seen</p>
<p>better days.  With few exceptions they are what a New Englander</p>
<p>would call &quot;slack-twisted and shiftless.&quot;  Their barns are pervious</p>
<p>to the weather, and their fences fail to connect.  Sleds and</p>
<p>ploughs rust together beside the house, and chickens scratch up the</p>
<p>front-door yard.  In truth, the people have been somewhat</p>
<p>demoralised by the conflicting claims of different occupations;</p>
<p>hunting in the fall, lumbering in the winter and spring, and</p>
<p>working for the American sportsmen in the brief angling season, are</p>
<p>so much more attractive and offer so much larger returns of ready</p>
<p>money, that the tedious toil of farming is neglected.  But for all</p>
<p>that, in the bright days of midsummer, these green fields sloping</p>
<p>down to the water, and pastures high up among the trees on the</p>
<p>hillsides, look pleasant from a distance, and give an inhabited air</p>
<p>to the landscape.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the Upsalquitch we passed the first of the fishing-</p>
<p>lodges.  It belongs to a sage angler from Albany who saw the beauty</p>
<p>of the situation, years ago, and built a habitation to match it.</p>
<p>Since that time a number of gentlemen have bought land fronting on</p>
<p>good pools, and put up little cottages of a less classical style</p>
<p>than Charles Cotton&#x27;s &quot;Fisherman&#x27;s Retreat&quot; on the banks of the</p>
<p>river Dove, but better suited to this wild scenery, and more</p>
<p>convenient to live in.  The prevailing pattern is a very simple</p>
<p>one; it consists of a broad piazza with a small house in the middle</p>
<p>of it.  The house bears about the same proportion to the piazza</p>
<p>that the crown of a Gainsborough hat does to the brim.  And the</p>
<p>cost of the edifice is to the cost of the land as the first price</p>
<p>of a share in a bankrupt railway is to the assessments which follow</p>
<p>the reorganisation.  All the best points have been sold, and real</p>
<p>estate on the Ristigouche has been bid up to an absurd figure.  In</p>
<p>fact, the river is over-populated and probably over-fished.  But we</p>
<p>could hardly find it in our hearts to regret this, for it made the</p>
<p>upward trip a very sociable one.  At every lodge that was open,</p>
<p>Favonius (who knows everybody) had a friend, and we must slip</p>
<p>ashore in a canoe to leave the mail and refresh the inner man.</p>
<p>An angler, like an Arab, regards hospitality as a religious duty.</p>
<p>There seems to be something in the craft which inclines the heart</p>
<p>to kindness and good-fellowship.  Few anglers have I seen who were</p>
<p>not pleasant to meet, and ready to do a good turn to a fellow-</p>
<p>fisherman with the gift of a killing fly or the loan of a rod.  Not</p>
<p>their own particular and well-proved favourite, of course, for that</p>
<p>is a treasure which no decent man would borrow; but with that</p>
<p>exception the best in their store is at the service of an</p>
<p>accredited brother.  One of the Ristigouche proprietors I remember,</p>
<p>whose name bespoke him a descendant of Caledonia&#x27;s patron saint.</p>
<p>He was fishing in front of his own door when we came up, with our</p>
<p>splashing horses, through the pool; but nothing would do but he</p>
<p>must up anchor and have us away with him into the house to taste</p>
<p>his good cheer.  And there were his daughters with their books and</p>
<p>needlework, and the photographs which they had taken pinned up on</p>
<p>the wooden walls, among Japanese fans and bits of bright-coloured</p>
<p>stuff in which the soul of woman delights, and, in a passive,</p>
<p>silent way, the soul of man also.  Then, after we had discussed the</p>
<p>year&#x27;s fishing, and the mysteries of the camera, and the deep</p>
<p>question of what makes some negatives too thin and others too</p>
<p>thick, we must go out to see the big salmon which one of the ladies</p>
<p>had caught a few days before, and the large trout swimming about in</p>
<p>their cold spring.  It seemed to me, as we went on our way, that</p>
<p>there could hardly be a more wholesome and pleasant summer-life for</p>
<p>well-bred young women than this, or two amusements more innocent</p>
<p>and sensible than photography and fly-fishing.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that the horse-yacht as a vehicle of travel is</p>
<p>not remarkable in point of speed.  Three miles an hour is not a</p>
<p>very rapid rate of motion.  But then, if you are not in a hurry,</p>
<p>why should you care to make haste?</p>
<p>The wild desire to be forever racing against old Father Time is one</p>
<p>of the kill-joys of modern life.  That ancient traveller is sure to</p>
<p>beat you in the long run, and as long as you are trying to rival</p>
<p>him, he will make your life a burden.  But if you will only</p>
<p>acknowledge his superiority and profess that you do not approve of</p>
<p>racing after all, he will settle down quietly beside you and jog</p>
<p>along like the most companionable of creatures.  That is a pleasant</p>
<p>pilgrimage in which the journey itself is part of the destination.</p>
<p>As soon as one learns to regard the horse-yacht as a sort of moving</p>
<p>house, it appears admirable.  There is no dust or smoke, no rumble</p>
<p>of wheels, or shriek of whistles.  You are gliding along steadily</p>
<p>through an ever-green world; skirting the silent hills; passing</p>
<p>from one side of the river to the other when the horses have to</p>
<p>swim the current to find a good foothold on the bank.  You are on</p>
<p>the water, but not at its mercy, for your craft is not disturbed by</p>
<p>the heaving of rude waves, and the serene inhabitants do not say &quot;I</p>
<p>am sick.&quot;  There is room enough to move about without falling</p>
<p>overboard.  You may sleep, or read, or write in your cabin, or sit</p>
<p>upon the floating piazza in an arm-chair and smoke the pipe of</p>
<p>peace, while the cool breeze blows in your face and the musical</p>
<p>waves go singing down to the sea.</p>
<p>There was one feature about the boat, which commended itself very</p>
<p>strongly to my mind.  It was possible to stand upon the forward</p>
<p>deck and do a little trout-fishing in motion.  By watching your</p>
<p>chance, when the corner of a good pool was within easy reach, you</p>
<p>could send out a hasty line and cajole a sea-trout from his hiding-</p>
<p>place.  It is true that the tow-ropes and the post made the back</p>
<p>cast a little awkward; and the wind sometimes blew the flies up on</p>
<p>the roof of the cabin; but then, with patience and a short line the</p>
<p>thing could be done.  I remember a pair of good trout that rose</p>
<p>together just as we were going through a boiling rapid; and it</p>
<p>tried the strength of my split-bamboo rod to bring those fish to</p>
<p>the net against the current and the motion of the boat.</p>
<p>When nightfall approached we let go the anchor (to wit, a rope tied</p>
<p>to a large stone on the shore), ate our dinner &quot;with gladness and</p>
<p>singleness of heart&quot; like the early Christians, and slept the sleep</p>
<p>of the just, lulled by the murmuring of the waters, and defended</p>
<p>from the insidious attacks of the mosquito by the breeze blowing</p>
<p>down the river and the impregnable curtains over our beds.  At</p>
<p>daybreak, long before Favonius and I had finished our dreams, we</p>
<p>were under way again; and when the trampling of the horses on some</p>
<p>rocky shore wakened us, we could see the steep hills gliding past</p>
<p>the windows and hear the rapids dashing against the side of the</p>
<p>boat, and it seemed as if we were still dreaming.</p>
<p>At Cross Point, where the river makes a long loop around a narrow</p>
<p>mountain, thin as a saw and crowned on its jagged edge by a rude</p>
<p>wooden cross, we stopped for an hour to try the fishing.  It was</p>
<p>here that I hooked two mysterious creatures, each of which took the</p>
<p>fly when it was below the surface, pulled for a few moments in a</p>
<p>sullen way and then apparently melted into nothingness.  It will</p>
<p>always be a source of regret to me that the nature of these fish</p>
<p>must remain unknown.  While they were on the line it was the</p>
<p>general opinion that they were heavy trout; but no sooner had they</p>
<p>departed, than I became firmly convinced, in accordance with a</p>
<p>psychological law which holds good all over the world, that they</p>
<p>were both enormous salmon.  Even the Turks have a proverb which</p>
<p>says, &quot;Every fish that escapes appears larger than it is.&quot;  No one</p>
<p>can alter that conviction, because no one can logically refute it.</p>
<p>Our best blessings, like our largest fish, always depart before we</p>
<p>have time to measure them.</p>
<p>The Slide Pool is in the wildest and most picturesque part of the</p>
<p>river, about thirty-five miles above Metapedia.  The stream,</p>
<p>flowing swiftly down a stretch of rapids between forest-clad hills,</p>
<p>runs straight toward the base of an eminence so precipitous that</p>
<p>the trees can hardly find a foothold upon it, and seem to be</p>
<p>climbing up in haste on either side of the long slide which leads</p>
<p>to the summit.  The current, barred by the wall of rock, takes a</p>
<p>great sweep to the right, dashing up at first in angry waves, then</p>
<p>falling away in oily curves and eddies, until at last it sleeps in</p>
<p>a black deep, apparently almost motionless, at the foot of the</p>
<p>hill.  It was here, on the upper edge of the stream, opposite to</p>
<p>the slide, that we brought our floating camp to anchor for some</p>
<p>days.  What does one do in such a watering-place?</p>
<p>Let us take a &quot;specimen day.&quot;  It is early morning, or to be more</p>
<p>precise, about eight of the clock, and the white fog is just</p>
<p>beginning to curl and drift away from the surface of the river.</p>
<p>Sooner than this it would be idle to go out.  The preternaturally</p>
<p>early bird in his greedy haste may catch the worm; but the salmon</p>
<p>never take the fly until the fog has lifted; and in this the</p>
<p>scientific angler sees, with gratitude, a remarkable adaptation of</p>
<p>the laws of nature to the tastes of man.  The canoes are waiting at</p>
<p>the front door.  We step into them and push off, Favonius going up</p>
<p>the stream a couple of miles to the mouth of the Patapedia, and I</p>
<p>down, a little shorter distance, to the famous Indian House Pool.</p>
<p>The slim boat glides easily on the current, with a smooth buoyant</p>
<p>motion, quickened by the strokes of the paddles in the bow and the</p>
<p>stern.  We pass around two curves in the river and find ourselves</p>
<p>at the head of the pool.  Here the man in the stern drops the</p>
<p>anchor, just on the edge of the bar where the rapid breaks over</p>
<p>into the deeper water.  The long rod is lifted; the fly unhooked</p>
<p>from the reel; a few feet of line pulled through the rings, and the</p>
<p>fishing begins.</p>
<p>First cast,--to the right, straight across the stream, about twenty</p>
<p>feet: the current carries the fly down with a semicircular sweep,</p>
<p>until it comes in line with the bow of the canoe.  Second cast,--to</p>
<p>the left, straight across the stream, with the same motion: the</p>
<p>semicircle is completed, and the fly hangs quivering for a few</p>
<p>seconds at the lowest point of the arc.  Three or four feet of line</p>
<p>are drawn from the reel.  Third cast to the right; fourth cast to</p>
<p>the left.  Then a little more line.  And so, with widening half-</p>
<p>circles, the water is covered, gradually and very carefully, until</p>
<p>at length the angler has as much line out as his two-handed rod can</p>
<p>lift and swing.  Then the first &quot;drop&quot; is finished; the man in the</p>
<p>stern quietly pulls up the anchor and lets the boat drift down a</p>
<p>few yards; the same process is repeated on the second drop; and so</p>
<p>on, until the end of the run is reached and the fly has passed over</p>
<p>all the good water.  This seems like a very regular and somewhat</p>
<p>mechanical proceeding as one describes it, but in the performance</p>
<p>it is rendered intensely interesting by the knowledge that at any</p>
<p>moment it is liable to be interrupted.</p>
<p>This morning the interruption comes early.  At the first cast of</p>
<p>the second drop, before the fly has fairly lit, a great flash of</p>
<p>silver darts from the waves close by the boat.  Usually a salmon</p>
<p>takes the fly rather slowly, carrying it under water before he</p>
<p>seizes it in his mouth.  But this one is in no mood for</p>
<p>deliberation.  He has hooked himself with a rush, and the line goes</p>
<p>whirring madly from the reel as he races down the pool.  Keep the</p>
<p>point of the rod low; he must have his own way now.  Up with the</p>
<p>anchor quickly, and send the canoe after him, bowman and sternman</p>
<p>paddling with swift strokes.  He has reached the deepest water; he</p>
<p>stops to think what has happened to him; we have passed around and</p>
<p>below him; and now, with the current to help us, we can begin to</p>
<p>reel in.  Lift the point of the rod, with a strong, steady pull.</p>
<p>Put the force of both arms into it.  The tough wood will stand the</p>
<p>strain.  The fish must be moved; he must come to the boat if he is</p>
<p>ever to be landed.  He gives a little and yields slowly to the</p>
<p>pressure.  Then suddenly he gives too much, and runs straight</p>
<p>toward us.  Reel in now as swiftly as possible, or else he will get</p>
<p>a slack on the line and escape.  Now he stops, shakes his head from</p>
<p>side to side, and darts away again across the pool, leaping high</p>
<p>out of water.  Don&#x27;t touch the reel!  Drop the point of the rod</p>
<p>quickly, for if he falls on the leader he will surely break it.</p>
<p>Another leap, and another!  Truly he is &quot;a merry one,&quot; and it will</p>
<p>go hard with us to hold him.  But those great leaps have exhausted</p>
<p>his strength, and now he follows the rod more easily.  The men push</p>
<p>the boat back to the shallow side of the pool until it touches</p>
<p>lightly on the shore.  The fish comes slowly in, fighting a little</p>
<p>and making a few short runs; he is tired and turns slightly on his</p>
<p>side; but even yet he is a heavy weight on the line, and it seems a</p>
<p>wonder that so slight a thing as the leader can guide and draw him.</p>
<p>Now he is close to the boat.  The boatman steps out on a rock with</p>
<p>his gaff.  Steadily now and slowly, lift the rod, bending it</p>
<p>backward.  A quick sure stroke of the steel! a great splash! and</p>
<p>the salmon is lifted upon the shore.  How he flounces about on the</p>
<p>stones.  Give him the coup de grace at once, for his own sake as</p>
<p>well as for ours.  And now look at him, as he lies there on the</p>
<p>green leaves.  Broad back; small head tapering to a point; clean,</p>
<p>shining sides with a few black spots on them; it is a fish fresh-</p>
<p>run from the sea, in perfect condition, and that is the reason why</p>
<p>he has given such good sport.</p>
<p>We must try for another before we go back.  Again fortune favours</p>
<p>us, and at eleven o&#x27;clock we pole up the river to the camp with two</p>
<p>good salmon in the canoe.  Hardly have we laid them away in the</p>
<p>ice-box, when Favonius comes dropping down from Patapedia with</p>
<p>three fish, one of them a twenty-four pounder.  And so the</p>
<p>morning&#x27;s work is done.</p>
<p>In the evening, after dinner, it was our custom to sit out on the</p>
<p>deck, watching the moonlight as it fell softly over the black hills</p>
<p>and changed the river into a pale flood of rolling gold.  The</p>
<p>fragrant wreaths of smoke floated lazily away on the faint breeze</p>
<p>of night.  There was no sound save the rushing of the water and the</p>
<p>crackling of the camp-fire on the shore.  We talked of many things</p>
<p>in the heavens above, and the earth beneath, and the waters under</p>
<p>the earth; touching lightly here and there as the spirit of vagrant</p>
<p>converse led us.  Favonius has the good sense to talk about himself</p>
<p>occasionally and tell his own experience.  The man who will not do</p>
<p>that must always be a dull companion.  Modest egoism is the salt of</p>
<p>conversation: you do not want too much of it; but if it is</p>
<p>altogether omitted, everything tastes flat.  I remember well the</p>
<p>evening when he told me the story of the Sheep of the Wilderness.</p>
<p>&quot;I was ill that summer,&quot; said he, &quot;and the doctor had ordered me to</p>
<p>go into the woods, but on no account to go without plenty of fresh</p>
<p>meat, which was essential to my recovery.  So we set out into the</p>
<p>wild country north of Georgian Bay, taking a live sheep with us in</p>
<p>order to be sure that the doctor&#x27;s prescription might be faithfully</p>
<p>followed.  It was a young and innocent little beast, curling itself</p>
<p>up at my feet in the canoe, and following me about on shore like a</p>
<p>dog.  I gathered grass every day to feed it, and carried it in my</p>
<p>arms over the rough portages.  It ate out of my hand and rubbed its</p>
<p>woolly head against my leggings.  To my dismay, I found that I was</p>
<p>beginning to love it for its own sake and without any ulterior</p>
<p>motives.  The thought of killing and eating it became more and more</p>
<p>painful to me, until at length the fatal fascination was complete,</p>
<p>and my trip became practically an exercise of devotion to that</p>
<p>sheep.  I carried it everywhere and ministered fondly to its wants.</p>
<p>Not for the world would I have alluded to mutton in its presence.</p>
<p>And when we returned to civilisation I parted from the creature</p>
<p>with sincere regret and the consciousness that I had humoured my</p>
<p>affections at the expense of my digestion.  The sheep did not give</p>
<p>me so much as a look of farewell, but fell to feeding on the grass</p>
<p>beside the farm-house with an air of placid triumph.&quot;</p>
<p>After hearing this touching tale, I was glad that no great intimacy</p>
<p>had sprung up between Favonius and the chickens which we carried in</p>
<p>a coop on the forecastle head, for there is no telling what</p>
<p>restrictions his tender-heartedness might have laid upon our</p>
<p>larder.  But perhaps a chicken would not have given such an opening</p>
<p>for misplaced affection as a sheep.  There is a great difference in</p>
<p>animals in this respect.  I certainly never heard of any one</p>
<p>falling in love with a salmon in such a way as to regard it as a</p>
<p>fond companion.  And this may be one reason why no sensible person</p>
<p>who has tried fishing has ever been able to see any cruelty in it.</p>
<p>Suppose the fish is not caught by an angler, what is his</p>
<p>alternative fate?  He will either perish miserably in the struggles</p>
<p>of the crowded net, or die of old age and starvation like the long,</p>
<p>lean stragglers which are sometimes found in the shallow pools, or</p>
<p>be devoured by a larger fish, or torn to pieces by a seal or an</p>
<p>otter.  Compared with any of these miserable deaths, the fate of a</p>
<p>salmon who is hooked in a clear stream and after a glorious fight</p>
<p>receives the happy despatch at the moment when he touches the</p>
<p>shore, is a sort of euthanasia.  And, since the fish was made to be</p>
<p>man&#x27;s food, the angler who brings him to the table of destiny in</p>
<p>the cleanest, quickest, kindest way is, in fact, his benefactor.</p>
<p>There were some days, however, when our benevolent intentions</p>
<p>toward the salmon were frustrated; mornings when they refused to</p>
<p>rise, and evenings when they escaped even the skilful endeavours of</p>
<p>Favonius.  In vain did he try every fly in his book, from the</p>
<p>smallest &quot;Silver Doctor&quot; to the largest &quot;Golden Eagle.&quot;  The &quot;Black</p>
<p>Dose&quot; would not move them.  The &quot;Durham Ranger&quot; covered the pool in</p>
<p>vain.  On days like this, if a stray fish rose, it was hard to land</p>
<p>him, for he was usually but slightly hooked.</p>
<p>I remember one of these shy creatures which led me a pretty dance</p>
<p>at the mouth of Patapedia.  He came to the fly just at dusk, rising</p>
<p>very softly and quietly, as if he did not really care for it but</p>
<p>only wanted to see what it was like.  He went down at once into</p>
<p>deep water, and began the most dangerous and exasperating of all</p>
<p>salmon-tactics, moving around in slow circles and shaking his head</p>
<p>from side to side, with sullen pertinacity.  This is called</p>
<p>&quot;jigging,&quot; and unless it can be stopped, the result is fatal.</p>
<p>I could not stop it.  That salmon was determined to jig.  He knew</p>
<p>more than I did.</p>
<p>The canoe followed him down the pool.  He jigged away past all</p>
<p>three of the inlets of the Patapedia, and at last, in the still,</p>
<p>deep water below, after we had laboured with him for half an hour,</p>
<p>and brought him near enough to see that he was immense, he calmly</p>
<p>opened his mouth and the fly came back to me void.  That was a sad</p>
<p>evening, in which all the consolations of philosophy were needed.</p>
<p>Sunday was a very peaceful day in our camp.  In the Dominion of</p>
<p>Canada, the question &quot;to fish or not to fish&quot; on the first day of</p>
<p>the week is not left to the frailty of the individual conscience.</p>
<p>The law on the subject is quite explicit, and says that between six</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock on Saturday evening and six o&#x27;clock on Monday morning all</p>
<p>nets shall be taken up and no one shall wet a line.  The</p>
<p>Ristigouche Salmon Club has its guardians stationed all along the</p>
<p>river, and they are quite as inflexible in seeing that their</p>
<p>employers keep this law as the famous sentinel was in refusing to</p>
<p>let Napoleon pass without the countersign.  But I do not think that</p>
<p>these keen sportsmen regard it as a hardship; they are quite</p>
<p>willing that the fish should have &quot;an off day&quot; in every week, and</p>
<p>only grumble because some of the net-owners down at the mouth of</p>
<p>the river have brought political influence to bear in their favour</p>
<p>and obtained exemption from the rule.  For our part, we were</p>
<p>nothing loath to hang up our rods, and make the day different from</p>
<p>other days.</p>
<p>In the morning we had a service in the cabin of the boat, gathering</p>
<p>a little congregation of guardians and boatmen, and people from a</p>
<p>solitary farm-house by the river.  They came in pirogues--long,</p>
<p>narrow boats hollowed from the trunk of a tree; the black-eyed,</p>
<p>brown-faced girls sitting back to back in the middle of the boat,</p>
<p>and the men standing up bending to their poles.  It seemed a</p>
<p>picturesque way of travelling, although none too safe.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we sat on deck and looked at the water.  What a</p>
<p>charm there is in watching a swift stream!  The eye never wearies</p>
<p>of following its curls and eddies, the shadow of the waves dancing</p>
<p>over the stones, the strange, crinkling lines of sunlight in the</p>
<p>shallows.  There is a sort of fascination in it, lulling and</p>
<p>soothing the mind into a quietude which is even pleasanter than</p>
<p>sleep, and making it almost possible to do that of which we so</p>
<p>often speak, but which we never quite accomplish--&quot;think about</p>
<p>nothing.&quot;  Out on the edge of the pool, we could see five or six</p>
<p>huge salmon, moving slowly from side to side, or lying motionless</p>
<p>like gray shadows.  There was nothing to break the silence except</p>
<p>the thin clear whistle of the white-throated sparrow far back in</p>
<p>the woods.  This is almost the only bird-song that one hears on the</p>
<p>river, unless you count the metallic &quot;chr-r-r-r&quot; of the kingfisher</p>
<p>as a song.</p>
<p>Every now and then one of the salmon in the pool would lazily roll</p>
<p>out of water, or spring high into the air and fall back with a</p>
<p>heavy splash.  What is it that makes salmon leap?  Is it pain or</p>
<p>pleasure?  Do they do it to escape the attack of another fish, or</p>
<p>to shake off a parasite that clings to them, or to practise jumping</p>
<p>so that they can ascend the falls when they reach them, or simply</p>
<p>and solely out of exuberant gladness and joy of living?  Any one of</p>
<p>these reasons would be enough to account for it on week-days.  On</p>
<p>Sunday I am quite sure they do it for the trial of the fisherman&#x27;s</p>
<p>faith.</p>
<p>But how should I tell all the little incidents which made that lazy</p>
<p>voyage so delightful?  Favonius was the ideal host, for on water,</p>
<p>as well as on land, he knows how to provide for the liberty as well</p>
<p>as for the wants of his guests.  He understands also the fine art</p>
<p>of conversation, which consists of silence as well as speech.  And</p>
<p>when it comes to angling, Izaak Walton himself could not have been</p>
<p>a more profitable teacher by precept or example.  Indeed, it is a</p>
<p>curious thought, and one full of sadness to a well-constituted</p>
<p>mind, that on the Ristigouche &quot;I. W.&quot; would have been at sea, for</p>
<p>the beloved father of all fishermen passed through this world</p>
<p>without ever catching a salmon.  So ill does fortune match with</p>
<p>merit here below.</p>
<p>At last the days of idleness were ended.  We could not</p>

<p>but we took down the long rods, put away the heavy reels, made the</p>
<p>canoes fast to the side of the house, embarked the three horses on</p>
<p>the front deck, and then dropped down with the current, swinging</p>
<p>along through the rapids, and drifting slowly through the still</p>
<p>places, now grounding on a hidden rock, and now sweeping around a</p>
<p>sharp curve, until at length we saw the roofs of Metapedia and the</p>
<p>ugly bridge of the railway spanning the river.  There we left our</p>
<p>floating house, awkward and helpless, like some strange relic of</p>
<p>the flood, stranded on the shore.  And as we climbed the bank we</p>
<p>looked back and wondered whether Noah was sorry when he said good-</p>

<p>ALPENROSEN AND GOAT&#x27;S MILK</p>
<p>Nay, let me tell you, there be many that have forty times our</p>
<p>estates, that would give the greatest part of it to be healthful</p>
<p>and cheerful like us; who, with the expense of a little money, have</p>
<p>ate, and drank, and laughed, and angled, and sung, and slept</p>
<p>securely; and rose next day, and cast away care, and sung, and</p>
<p>laughed, and angled again; which are blessings rich men cannot</p>
<p>purchase with all their money.&quot;--IZAAK WALTON: The Complete Angler.</p>
<p>A great deal of the pleasure of life lies in bringing together</p>
<p>things which have no connection.  That is the secret of humour--at</p>
<p>least so we are told by the philosophers who explain the jests that</p>
<p>other men have made--and in regard to travel, I am quite sure that</p>
<p>it must be illogical in order to be entertaining.  The more</p>
<p>contrasts it contains, the better.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was some philosophical reflection of this kind that</p>
<p>brought me to the resolution, on a certain summer day, to make a</p>
<p>little journey, as straight as possible, from the sea-level streets</p>
<p>of Venice to the lonely, lofty summit of a Tyrolese mountain,</p>
<p>called, for no earthly reason that I can discover, the Gross-</p>
<p>Venediger.</p>
<p>But apart from the philosophy of the matter, which I must confess</p>
<p>to passing over very superficially at the time, there were other</p>
<p>and more cogent reasons for wanting to go from Venice to the Big</p>
<p>Venetian.  It was the first of July, and the city on the sea was</p>
<p>becoming tepid.  A slumbrous haze brooded over canals and palaces</p>
<p>and churches.  It was difficult to keep one&#x27;s conscience awake to</p>
<p>Baedeker and a sense of moral obligation; Ruskin was impossible,</p>
<p>and a picture-gallery was a penance.  We floated lazily from one</p>
<p>place to another, and decided that, after all, it was too warm to</p>
<p>go in.  The cries of the gondoliers, at the canal corners, grew</p>
<p>more and more monotonous and dreamy.  There was danger of our</p>
<p>falling fast asleep and having to pay by the hour for a day&#x27;s</p>
<p>repose in a gondola.  If it grew much warmer, we might be compelled</p>
<p>to stay until the following winter in order to recover energy</p>
<p>enough to get away.  All the signs of the times pointed northward,</p>
<p>to the mountains, where we should see glaciers and snow-fields, and</p>
<p>pick Alpenrosen, and drink goat&#x27;s milk fresh from the real goat.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>The first stage on the journey thither was by rail to Belluno--</p>
<p>about four or five hours.  It is a sufficient commentary on railway</p>
<p>travel that the most important thing about it is to tell how many</p>
<p>hours it takes to get from one place to another.</p>
<p>We arrived in Belluno at night, and when we awoke the next morning</p>
<p>we found ourselves in a picturesque little city of Venetian aspect,</p>
<p>with a piazza and a campanile and a Palladian cathedral, surrounded</p>
<p>on all sides by lofty hills.  We were at the end of the railway and</p>
<p>at the beginning of the Dolomites.</p>
<p>Although I have a constitutional aversion to scientific information</p>
<p>given by unscientific persons, such as clergymen and men of</p>
<p>letters, I must go in that direction far enough to make it clear</p>
<p>that the word Dolomite does not describe a kind of fossil, nor a</p>
<p>sect of heretics, but a formation of mountains lying between the</p>
<p>Alps and the Adriatic.  Draw a diamond on the map, with Brixen at</p>
<p>the northwest corner, Lienz at the northeast, Belluno at the</p>
<p>southeast, and Trent at the southwest, and you will have included</p>
<p>the region of the Dolomites, a country so picturesque, so</p>
<p>interesting, so full of sublime and beautiful scenery, that it is</p>
<p>equally a wonder and a blessing that it has not been long since</p>
<p>completely overrun by tourists and ruined with railways.  It is</p>
<p>true, the glaciers and snowfields are limited; the waterfalls are</p>
<p>comparatively few and slender, and the rivers small; the loftiest</p>
<p>peaks are little more than ten thousand feet high.  But, on the</p>
<p>other hand, the mountains are always near, and therefore always</p>
<p>imposing.  Bold, steep, fantastic masses of naked rock, they rise</p>
<p>suddenly from the green and flowery valleys in amazing and endless</p>
<p>contrast; they mirror themselves in the tiny mountain lakes like</p>
<p>pictures in a dream.</p>
<p>I believe the guide-book says that they are formed of carbonate of</p>
<p>lime and carbonate of magnesia in chemical composition; but even if</p>
<p>this be true, it need not prejudice any candid observer against</p>
<p>them.  For the simple and fortunate fact is that they are built of</p>
<p>such stone that wind and weather, keen frost and melting snow and</p>
<p>rushing water have worn and cut and carved them into a thousand</p>
<p>shapes of wonder and beauty.  It needs but little fancy to see in</p>
<p>them walls and towers, cathedrals and campaniles, fortresses and</p>
<p>cities, tinged with many hues from pale gray to deep red, and</p>
<p>shining in an air so soft, so pure, so cool, so fragrant, under a</p>
<p>sky so deep and blue and a sunshine so genial, that it seems like</p>
<p>the happy union of Switzerland and Italy.</p>
<p>The great highway through this region from south to north is the</p>
<p>Ampezzo road, which was constructed in 1830, along the valleys of</p>
<p>the Piave, the Boite, and the Rienz--the ancient line of travel and</p>
<p>commerce between Venice and Innsbruck.  The road is superbly built,</p>
<p>smooth and level.  Our carriage rolled along so easily that we</p>
<p>forgot and forgave its venerable appearance and its lack of</p>
<p>accommodation for trunks.  We had been persuaded to take four</p>
<p>horses, as our luggage seemed too formidable for a single pair.</p>
<p>But in effect our concession to apparent necessity turned out to be</p>
<p>a mere display of superfluous luxury, for the two white leaders did</p>
<p>little more than show their feeble paces, leaving the gray wheelers</p>
<p>to do the work.  We had the elevating sense of traveling four-in-</p>
<p>hand, however--a satisfaction to which I do not believe any human</p>
<p>being is altogether insensible.</p>
<p>At Longarone we breakfasted for the second time, and entered the</p>
<p>narrow gorge of the Piave.  The road was cut out of the face of the</p>
<p>rock.  Below us the long lumber-rafts went shooting down the swift</p>
<p>river.  Above, on the right, were the jagged crests of Monte Furlon</p>
<p>and Premaggiore, which seemed to us very wonderful, because we had</p>
<p>not yet learned how jagged the Dolomites can be.  At Perarolo,</p>
<p>where the Boite joins the Piave, there is a lump of a mountain in</p>
<p>the angle between the rivers, and around this we crawled in long</p>
<p>curves until we had risen a thousand feet, and arrived at the same</p>
<p>Hotel Venezia, where we were to dine.</p>
<p>While dinner was preparing, the Deacon and I walked up to Pieve di</p>
<p>Cadore, the birthplace of Titian.  The house in which the great</p>
<p>painter first saw the colours of the world is still standing, and</p>
<p>tradition points out the very room in which he began to paint.  I</p>
<p>am not one of those who would inquire too closely into such a</p>
<p>legend as this.  The cottage may have been rebuilt a dozen times</p>
<p>since Titian&#x27;s day; not a scrap of the original stone or plaster</p>
<p>may remain; but beyond a doubt the view that we saw from the window</p>
<p>is the same that Titian saw.  Now, for the first time, I could</p>
<p>understand and appreciate the landscape-backgrounds of his</p>
<p>pictures.  The compact masses of mountains, the bold, sharp forms,</p>
<p>the hanging rocks of cold gray emerging from green slopes, the</p>
<p>intense blue aerial distances--these all had seemed to be unreal</p>
<p>and imaginary--compositions of the studio.  But now I knew that,</p>
<p>whether Titian painted out-of-doors, like our modern</p>
<p>impressionists, or not, he certainly painted what he had seen, and</p>
<p>painted it as it is.</p>
<p>The graceful brown-eyed boy who showed us the house seemed also to</p>
<p>belong to one of Titian&#x27;s pictures.  As we were going away, the</p>
<p>Deacon, for lack of copper, rewarded him with a little silver</p>
<p>piece, a half-lira, in value about ten cents.  A celestial rapture</p>
<p>of surprise spread over the child&#x27;s face, and I know not what</p>
<p>blessings he invoked upon us.  He called his companions to rejoice</p>
<p>with him, and we left them clapping their hands and dancing.</p>
<p>Driving after one has dined has always a peculiar charm.  The</p>
<p>motion seems pleasanter, the landscape finer than in the morning</p>
<p>hours.  The road from Cadore ran on a high level, through sloping</p>
<p>pastures, white villages, and bits of larch forest.  In its narrow</p>
<p>bed, far below, the river Boite roared as gently as Bottom&#x27;s lion.</p>
<p>The afternoon sunlight touched the snow-capped pinnacle of Antelao</p>
<p>and the massive pink wall of Sorapis on the right; on the left,</p>
<p>across the valley, Monte Pelmo&#x27;s vast head and the wild crests of</p>
<p>La Rochetta and Formin rose dark against the glowing sky.  The</p>
<p>peasants lifted their hats as we passed, and gave us a pleasant</p>
<p>evening greeting.  And so, almost without knowing it, we slipped</p>
<p>out of Italy into Austria, and drew up before a bare, square stone</p>
<p>building with the double black eagle, like a strange fowl split for</p>
<p>broiling, staring at us from the wall, and an inscription to the</p>
<p>effect that this was the Royal and Imperial Austrian Custom-house.</p>
<p>The officer saluted us so politely that we felt quite sorry that</p>
<p>his duty required him to disturb our luggage.  &quot;The law obliged him</p>
<p>to open one trunk; courtesy forbade him to open more.&quot;  It was</p>
<p>quickly done; and, without having to make any contribution to the</p>
<p>income of His Royal and Imperial Majesty, Francis Joseph, we rolled</p>
<p>on our way, through the hamlets of Acqua Bona and Zuel, into the</p>
<p>Ampezzan metropolis of Cortina, at sundown.</p>
<p>The modest inn called &quot;The Star of Gold&quot; stood facing the public</p>
<p>square, just below the church, and the landlady stood facing us in</p>
<p>the doorway, with an enthusiastic welcome--altogether a most</p>
<p>friendly and entertaining landlady, whose one desire in life seemed</p>
<p>to be that we should never regret having chosen her house instead</p>
<p>of &quot;The White Cross,&quot; or &quot;The Black Eagle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O ja!&quot; she had our telegram received; and would we look at the</p>
<p>rooms?  Outlooking on the piazza, with a balcony from which we</p>
<p>could observe the Festa of to-morrow.  She hoped they would please</p>
<p>us.  &quot;Only come in; accommodate yourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>It was all as she promised; three little bedrooms, and a little</p>
<p>salon opening on a little balcony; queer old oil-paintings and</p>
<p>framed embroideries and tiles hanging on the walls; spotless</p>
<p>curtains, and board floors so white that it would have been a shame</p>
<p>to eat off them without spreading a cloth to keep them from being</p>
<p>soiled.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the rooms of the Baron Rothschild when he comes here</p>
<p>always in the summer--with nine horses and nine servants--the Baron</p>
<p>Rothschild of Vienna.&quot;</p>
<p>I assured her that we did not know the Baron, but that should make</p>
<p>no difference.  We would not ask her to reduce the price on account</p>
<p>of a little thing like that.</p>
<p>She did not quite grasp this idea, but hoped that we would not find</p>
<p>the pension too dear at a dollar and fifty-seven and a half cents a</p>
<p>day each, with a little extra for the salon and the balcony.  &quot;The</p>
<p>English people all please themselves here--there comes many every</p>
<p>summer--English Bishops and their families.&quot;</p>
<p>I inquired whether there were many Bishops in the house at that</p>
<p>moment.</p>
<p>&quot;No, just at present--she was very sorry--none.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; I said, &quot;it is all right.  We will take the rooms.&quot;</p>
<p>Good Signora Barbaria, you did not speak the American language, nor</p>
<p>understand those curious perversions of thought which pass among</p>
<p>the Americans for humour; but you understood how to make a little</p>
<p>inn cheerful and home-like; yours was a very simple and agreeable</p>
<p>art of keeping a hotel.  As we sat in the balcony after supper,</p>
<p>listening to the capital playing of the village orchestra, and the</p>
<p>Tyrolese songs with which they varied their music, we thought</p>
<p>within ourselves that we were fortunate to have fallen upon the</p>
<p>Star of Gold.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Cortina lies in its valley like a white shell that has rolled down</p>
<p>into a broad vase of malachite.  It has about a hundred houses and</p>
<p>seven hundred inhabitants, a large church and two small ones, a</p>
<p>fine stone campanile with excellent bells, and seven or eight</p>
<p>little inns.  But it is more important than its size would signify,</p>
<p>for it is the capital of the district whose lawful title is</p>
<p>Magnifica Comunita di Ampezzo--a name conferred long ago by the</p>
<p>Republic of Venice.  In the fifteenth century it was Venetian</p>
<p>territory; but in 1516, under Maximilian I., it was joined to</p>
<p>Austria; and it is now one of the richest and most prosperous</p>
<p>communes of the Tyrol.  It embraces about thirty-five hundred</p>
<p>people, scattered in hamlets and clusters of houses through the</p>
<p>green basin with its four entrances, lying between the peaks of</p>
<p>Tofana, Cristallo, Sorapis, and Nuvolau.  The well-cultivated grain</p>
<p>fields and meadows, the smooth alps filled with fine cattle, the</p>
<p>well-built houses with their white stone basements and balconies of</p>
<p>dark brown wood and broad overhanging roofs, all speak of industry</p>
<p>and thrift.  But there is more than mere agricultural prosperity in</p>
<p>this valley.  There is a fine race of men and women--intelligent,</p>
<p>vigorous, and with a strong sense of beauty.  The outer walls of</p>
<p>the annex of the Hotel Aquila Nera are covered with frescoes of</p>
<p>marked power and originality, painted by the son of the innkeeper.</p>
<p>The art schools of Cortina are famous for their beautiful work in</p>
<p>gold and silver filigree, and wood-inlaying.  There are nearly two</p>
<p>hundred pupils in these schools, all peasants&#x27; children, and they</p>
<p>produce results, especially in intarsia, which are admirable.  The</p>
<p>village orchestra, of which I spoke a moment ago, is trained and</p>
<p>led by a peasant&#x27;s son, who has never had a thorough musical</p>
<p>education.  It must have at least twenty-five members, and as we</p>
<p>heard them at the Festa they seemed to play with extraordinary</p>
<p>accuracy and expression.</p>
<p>This Festa gave us a fine chance to see the people of the Ampezzo</p>
<p>all together.  It was the annual jubilation of the district; and</p>
<p>from all the outlying hamlets and remote side valleys, even from</p>
<p>the neighbouring vales of Agordo and Auronzo, across the mountains,</p>
<p>and from Cadore, the peasants, men and women and children, had come</p>
<p>in to the Sagro at Cortina.  The piazza--which is really nothing</p>
<p>more than a broadening of the road behind the church--was quite</p>
<p>thronged.  There must have been between two and three thousand</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>The ceremonies of the day began with general church-going.  The</p>
<p>people here are honestly and naturally religious.  I have seen so</p>
<p>many examples of what can only be called &quot;sincere and unaffected</p>
<p>piety,&quot; that I cannot doubt it.  The church, on Cortina&#x27;s feast-</p>
<p>day, was crowded to the doors with worshippers, who gave every</p>
<p>evidence of taking part not only with the voice, but also with the</p>
<p>heart, in the worship.</p>
<p>Then followed the public unveiling of a tablet, on the wall of the</p>
<p>little Inn of the Anchor, to the memory of Giammaria Ghedini, the</p>
<p>founder of the art-schools of Cortina.  There was music by the</p>
<p>band; and an oration by a native Demosthenes (who spoke in Italian</p>
<p>so fluent that it ran through one&#x27;s senses like water through a</p>
<p>sluice, leaving nothing behind), and an original Canto sung by the</p>
<p>village choir, with a general chorus, in which they called upon the</p>
<p>various mountains to &quot;re-echo the name of the beloved master John-</p>
<p>Mary as a model of modesty and true merit,&quot; and wound up with--</p>

<p>It was very primitive, and I do not suppose that the celebration</p>
<p>was even mentioned in the newspapers of the great world; but, after</p>
<p>all, has not the man who wins such a triumph as this in the hearts</p>
<p>of his own people, for whom he has made labour beautiful with the</p>
<p>charm of art, deserved better of fame than many a crowned monarch</p>
<p>or conquering warrior?  We should be wiser if we gave less glory to</p>
<p>the men who have been successful in forcing their fellow-men to</p>
<p>die, and more glory to the men who have been successful in teaching</p>
<p>their fellow-men how to live.</p>
<p>But the Festa of Cortina did not remain all day on this high moral</p>
<p>plane.  In the afternoon came what our landlady called &quot;allerlei</p>
<p>Dummheiten.&quot;  There was a grand lottery for the benefit of the</p>
<p>Volunteer Fire Department.  The high officials sat up in a green</p>
<p>wooden booth in the middle of the square, and called out the</p>
<p>numbers and distributed the prizes.  Then there was a greased pole</p>
<p>with various articles of an attractive character tied to a large</p>
<p>hoop at the top--silk aprons, and a green jacket, and bottles of</p>
<p>wine, and half a smoked pig, and a coil of rope, and a purse.</p>
<p>The gallant firemen voluntarily climbed up the pole as far as</p>
<p>they could, one after another, and then involuntarily slid down</p>
<p>again exhausted, each one wiping off a little more of the grease,</p>
<p>until at last the lucky one came who profited by his forerunners&#x27;</p>
<p>labours, and struggled to the top to snatch the smoked pig.</p>
<p>After that it was easy.</p>
<p>Such is success in this unequal world; the man who wipes off the</p>
<p>grease seldom gets the prize.</p>
<p>Then followed various games, with tubs of water; and coins fastened</p>
<p>to the bottom of a huge black frying-pan, to be plucked off with</p>
<p>the lips; and pots of flour to be broken with sticks; so that the</p>
<p>young lads of the village were ducked and blackened and powdered to</p>
<p>an unlimited extent, amid the hilarious applause of the spectators.</p>
<p>In the evening there was more music, and the peasants danced in the</p>
<p>square, the women quietly and rather heavily, but the men with</p>
<p>amazing agility, slapping the soles of their shoes with their</p>
<p>hands, or turning cartwheels in front of their partners.  At dark</p>
<p>the festivities closed with a display of fireworks; there were</p>
<p>rockets and bombs and pin-wheels; and the boys had tiny red and</p>
<p>blue lights which they held until their fingers were burned, just</p>
<p>as boys do in America; and there was a general hush of wonder as a</p>
<p>particularly brilliant rocket swished into the dark sky; and when</p>
<p>it burst into a rain of serpents, the crowd breathed out its</p>
<p>delight in a long-drawn &quot;Ah-h-h-h!&quot; just as the crowd does</p>
<p>everywhere.  We might easily have imagined ourselves at a Fourth of</p>
<p>July celebration in Vermont, if it had not been for the costumes.</p>
<p>The men of the Ampezzo Valley have kept but little that is peculiar</p>
<p>in their dress.  Men are naturally more progressive than women, and</p>
<p>therefore less picturesque.  The tide of fashion has swept them</p>
<p>into the international monotony of coat and vest and trousers--</p>
<p>pretty much the same, and equally ugly, all over the world.  Now</p>
<p>and then you may see a short jacket with silver buttons, or a pair</p>
<p>of knee-breeches; and almost all the youths wear a bunch of</p>
<p>feathers or a tuft of chamois&#x27; hair in their soft green hats.  But</p>
<p>the women of the Ampezzo--strong, comely, with golden brown</p>
<p>complexions, and often noble faces--are not ashamed to dress as</p>
<p>their grandmothers did.  They wear a little round black felt hat</p>
<p>with rolled rim and two long ribbons hanging down at the back.</p>
<p>Their hair is carefully braided and coiled, and stuck through and</p>
<p>through with great silver pins.  A black bodice, fastened with</p>
<p>silver clasps, is covered in front with the ends of a brilliant</p>
<p>silk kerchief, laid in many folds around the shoulders.  The white</p>
<p>shirt-sleeves are very full and fastened up above the elbow with</p>
<p>coloured ribbon.  If the weather is cool, the women wear a short</p>
<p>black jacket, with satin yoke and high puffed sleeves.  But,</p>
<p>whatever the weather may be, they make no change in the large, full</p>
<p>dark skirts, almost completely covered with immense silk aprons, by</p>
<p>preference light blue.  It is not a remarkably brilliant dress,</p>
<p>compared with that which one may still see in some districts of</p>
<p>Norway or Sweden, but upon the whole it suits the women of the</p>
<p>Ampezzo wonderfully.</p>
<p>For my part, I think that when a woman has found a dress that</p>
<p>becomes her, it is a waste of time to send to Paris for a fashion-</p>
<p>plate.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>When the excitement of the Festa had subsided, we were free to</p>
<p>abandon ourselves to the excursions in which the neighbourhood of</p>
<p>Cortina abounds, and to which the guide-book earnestly calls every</p>
<p>right-minded traveller.  A walk through the light-green shadows of</p>
<p>the larch-woods to the tiny lake of Ghedina, where we could see all</p>
<p>the four dozen trout swimming about in the clear water and catching</p>
<p>flies; a drive to the Belvedere, where there are superficial</p>
<p>refreshments above and profound grottos below; these were trifles,</p>
<p>though we enjoyed them.  But the great mountains encircling us on</p>
<p>every side, standing out in clear view with that distinctness and</p>
<p>completeness of vision which is one charm of the Dolomites, seemed</p>
<p>to summon us to more arduous enterprises.  Accordingly, the Deacon</p>
<p>and I selected the easiest one, engaged a guide, and prepared for</p>
<p>the ascent.</p>
<p>Monte Nuvolau is not a perilous mountain.  I am quite sure that at</p>
<p>my present time of life I should be unwilling to ascend a perilous</p>
<p>mountain unless there were something extraordinarily desirable at</p>
<p>the top, or remarkably disagreeable at the bottom.  Mere risk has</p>
<p>lost the attractions which it once had.  As the father of a family</p>
<p>I felt bound to abstain from going for amusement into any place</p>
<p>which a Christian lady might not visit with propriety and safety.</p>
<p>Our preparation for Nuvolau, therefore, did not consist of ropes,</p>
<p>ice-irons, and axes, but simply of a lunch and two long sticks.</p>
<p>Our way led us, in the early morning, through the clustering houses</p>
<p>of Lacedel, up the broad, green slope that faces Cortina on the</p>
<p>west, to the beautiful Alp Pocol.  Nothing could exceed the</p>
<p>pleasure of such a walk in the cool of the day, while the dew still</p>
<p>lies on the short, rich grass, and the myriads of flowers are at</p>
<p>their brightest and sweetest.  The infinite variety and abundance</p>
<p>of the blossoms is a continual wonder.  They are sown more thickly</p>
<p>than the stars in heaven, and the rainbow itself does not show so</p>
<p>many tints.  Here they are mingled like the threads of some strange</p>
<p>embroidery; and there again nature has massed her colours; so that</p>
<p>one spot will be all pale blue with innumerable forget-me-nots, or</p>
<p>dark blue with gentians; another will blush with the delicate pink</p>
<p>of the Santa Lucia or the deeper red of the clover; and another</p>
<p>will shine yellow as cloth of gold.  Over all this opulence of</p>
<p>bloom the larks were soaring and singing.  I never heard so many as</p>
<p>in the meadows about Cortina.  There was always a sweet spray of</p>
<p>music sprinkling down out of the sky, where the singers poised</p>
<p>unseen.  It was like walking through a shower of melody.</p>
<p>From the Alp Pocol, which is simply a fair, lofty pasture, we had</p>
<p>our first full view of Nuvolau, rising bare and strong, like a huge</p>
<p>bastion, from the dark fir-woods.  Through these our way led onward</p>
<p>now for seven miles, with but a slight ascent.  Then turning off to</p>
<p>the left we began to climb sharply through the forest.  There we</p>
<p>found abundance of the lovely Alpenrosen, which do not bloom on the</p>
<p>lower ground.  Their colour is a deep, glowing pink, and when a</p>
<p>Tyrolese girl gives you one of these flowers to stick in the band</p>
<p>of your hat, you may know that you have found favour in her eyes.</p>
<p>Through the wood the cuckoo was calling--the bird which reverses</p>
<p>the law of good children, and insists on being heard, but not seen.</p>
<p>When the forest was at an end we found ourselves at the foot of an</p>
<p>alp which sloped steeply up to the Five Towers of Averau.  The</p>
<p>effect of these enormous masses of rock, standing out in lonely</p>
<p>grandeur, like the ruins of some forsaken habitation of giants, was</p>
<p>tremendous.  Seen from far below in the valley their form was</p>
<p>picturesque and striking; but as we sat beside the clear, cold</p>
<p>spring which gushes out at the foot of the largest tower, the</p>
<p>Titanic rocks seemed to hang in the air above us as if they would</p>
<p>overawe us into a sense of their majesty.  We felt it to the full;</p>
<p>yet none the less, but rather the more, could we feel at the same</p>
<p>time the delicate and ethereal beauty of the fringed gentianella</p>
<p>and the pale Alpine lilies scattered on the short turf beside us.</p>
<p>We had now been on foot about three hours and a half.  The half</p>
<p>hour that remained was the hardest.  Up over loose, broken stones</p>
<p>that rolled beneath our feet, up over great slopes of rough rock,</p>
<p>up across little fields of snow where we paused to celebrate the</p>
<p>Fourth of July with a brief snowball fight, up along a narrowing</p>
<p>ridge with a precipice on either hand, and so at last to the</p>
<p>summit, 8600 feet above the sea.</p>
<p>It is not a great height, but it is a noble situation.  For Nuvolau</p>
<p>is fortunately placed in the very centre of the Dolomites, and so</p>
<p>commands a finer view than many a higher mountain.  Indeed, it is</p>
<p>not from the highest peaks, according to my experience, that one</p>
<p>gets the grandest prospects, but rather from those of middle</p>
<p>height, which are so isolated as to give a wide circle of vision,</p>
<p>and from which one can see both the valleys and the summits.  Monte</p>
<p>Rosa itself gives a less imposing view than the Gorner Grat.</p>
<p>It is possible, in this world, to climb too high for pleasure.</p>
<p>But what a panorama Nuvolau gave us on that clear, radiant summer</p>
<p>morning--a perfect circle of splendid sight!  On one side we looked</p>
<p>down upon the Five Towers; on the other, a thousand feet below, the</p>
<p>Alps, dotted with the huts of the herdsmen, sloped down into the</p>
<p>deep-cut vale of Agordo.  Opposite to us was the enormous mass of</p>
<p>Tofana, a pile of gray and pink and saffron rock.  When we turned</p>
<p>the other way, we faced a group of mountains as ragged as the</p>
<p>crests of a line of fir-trees, and behind them loomed the solemn</p>
<p>head of Pelmo.  Across the broad vale of the Boite, Antelao stood</p>
<p>beside Sorapis, like a campanile beside a cathedral, and Cristallo</p>
<p>towered above the green pass of the Three Crosses.  Through that</p>
<p>opening we could see the bristling peaks of the Sextenthal.</p>
<p>Sweeping around in a wider circle from that point, we saw, beyond</p>
<p>the Durrenstein, the snow-covered pile of the Gross-Glockner; the</p>
<p>crimson bastions of the Rothwand appeared to the north, behind</p>
<p>Tofana; then the white slopes that hang far away above the</p>
<p>Zillerthal; and, nearer, the Geislerspitze, like five fingers</p>
<p>thrust into the air; behind that, the distant Oetzthaler Mountain,</p>
<p>and just a single white glimpse of the highest peak of the Ortler</p>
<p>by the Engadine; nearer still we saw the vast fortress of the Sella</p>
<p>group and the red combs of the Rosengarten; Monte Marmolata, the</p>
<p>Queen of the Dolomites, stood before us revealed from base to peak</p>
<p>in a bridal dress of snow; and southward we looked into the dark</p>
<p>rugged face of La Civetta, rising sheer out of the vale of Agordo,</p>
<p>where the Lake of Alleghe slept unseen.  It was a sea of mountains,</p>
<p>tossed around us into a myriad of motionless waves, and with a</p>
<p>rainbow of colours spread among their hollows and across their</p>
<p>crests.  The cliffs of rose and orange and silver gray, the valleys</p>
<p>of deepest green, the distant shadows of purple and melting blue,</p>
<p>and the dazzling white of the scattered snow-fields seemed to shift</p>
<p>and vary like the hues on the inside of a shell.  And over all,</p>
<p>from peak to peak, the light, feathery clouds went drifting lazily</p>
<p>and slowly, as if they could not leave a scene so fair.</p>
<p>There is barely room on the top of Nuvolau for the stone shelter-</p>
<p>hut which a grateful Saxon baron has built there as a sort of</p>
<p>votive offering for the recovery of his health among the mountains.</p>
<p>As we sat within and ate our frugal lunch, we were glad that he had</p>
<p>recovered his health, and glad that he had built the hut, and glad</p>
<p>that we had come to it.  In fact, we could almost sympathise in our</p>
<p>cold, matter-of-fact American way with the sentimental German</p>
<p>inscription which we read on the wall:--</p>

<p>We refrained, however, from shouting anything through Nature&#x27;s</p>
<p>heaven, but went lightly down, in about three hours, to supper in</p>
<p>the Star of Gold.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>When a stern necessity forces one to leave Cortina, there are</p>
<p>several ways of departure.  We selected the main highway for our</p>
<p>trunks, but for ourselves the Pass of the Three Crosses; the Deacon</p>
<p>and the Deaconess in a mountain waggon, and I on foot.  It should</p>
<p>be written as an axiom in the philosophy of travel that the easiest</p>
<p>way is best for your luggage, and the hardest way is best for</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>All along the rough road up to the Pass, we had a glorious outlook</p>
<p>backward over the Val d&#x27; Ampezzo, and when we came to the top, we</p>
<p>looked deep down into the narrow Val Buona behind Sorapis.  I do</p>
<p>not know just when we passed the Austrian border, but when we came</p>
<p>to Lake Misurina we found ourselves in Italy again.  My friends</p>
<p>went on down the valley to Landro, but I in my weakness, having</p>
<p>eaten of the trout of the lake for dinner, could not resist the</p>
<p>temptation of staying over-night to catch one for breakfast.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant failure.  The lake was beautiful, lying on top of</p>
<p>the mountain like a bit of blue sky, surrounded by the peaks of</p>
<p>Cristallo, Cadino, and the Drei Zinnen.  It was a happiness to</p>
<p>float on such celestial waters and cast the hopeful fly.  The trout</p>
<p>were there; they were large; I saw them; they also saw me; but,</p>
<p>alas! I could not raise them.  Misurina is, in fact, what the</p>
<p>Scotch call &quot;a dour loch,&quot; one of those places which are outwardly</p>
<p>beautiful, but inwardly so demoralised that the trout will not</p>
<p>rise.</p>
<p>When we came ashore in the evening, the boatman consoled me with</p>
<p>the story of a French count who had spent two weeks there fishing,</p>
<p>and only caught one fish.  I had some thoughts of staying thirteen</p>
<p>days longer, to rival the count, but concluded to go on the next</p>
<p>morning, over Monte Pian and the Cat&#x27;s Ladder to Landro.</p>
<p>The view from Monte Pian is far less extensive than that from</p>
<p>Nuvolau; but it has the advantage of being very near the wild</p>
<p>jumble of the Sexten Dolomites.  The Three Shoemakers and a lot</p>
<p>more of sharp and ragged fellows are close by, on the east; on the</p>
<p>west, Cristallo shows its fine little glacier, and Rothwand its</p>
<p>crimson cliffs; and southward Misurina gives to the view a glimpse</p>
<p>of water, without which, indeed, no view is complete.  Moreover,</p>
<p>the mountain has the merit of being, as its name implies, quite</p>
<p>gentle.  I met the Deacon and the Deaconess at the top, they having</p>
<p>walked up from Landro.  And so we crossed the boundary line</p>
<p>together again, seven thousand feet above the sea, from Italy into</p>
<p>Austria.  There was no custom-house.</p>
<p>The way down, by the Cat&#x27;s Ladder, I travelled alone.  The path was</p>
<p>very steep and little worn, but even on the mountain-side there was</p>
<p>no danger of losing it, for it had been blazed here and there, on</p>
<p>trees and stones, with a dash of blue paint.  This is the work of</p>
<p>the invaluable DOAV--which is, being interpreted, the German-</p>
<p>Austrian Alpine Club.  The more one travels in the mountains, the</p>
<p>more one learns to venerate this beneficent society, for the</p>
<p>shelter-huts and guide-posts it has erected, and the paths it has</p>
<p>made and marked distinctly with various colours.  The Germans have</p>
<p>a genius for thoroughness.  My little brown guide-book, for</p>
<p>example, not only informed me through whose back yard I must go to</p>
<p>get into a certain path, but it told me that in such and such a</p>
<p>spot I should find quite a good deal (ziemlichviel) of Edelweiss,</p>
<p>and in another a small echo; it advised me in one valley to take</p>
<p>provisions and dispense with a guide, and in another to take a</p>
<p>guide and dispense with provisions, adding varied information in</p>
<p>regard to beer, which in my case was useless, for I could not touch</p>
<p>it.  To go astray under such auspices would be worse than</p>
<p>inexcusable.</p>
<p>Landro we found a very different place from Cortina.  Instead of</p>
<p>having a large church and a number of small hotels, it consists</p>
<p>entirely of one large hotel and a very tiny church.  It does not</p>
<p>lie in a broad, open basin, but in a narrow valley, shut in closely</p>
<p>by the mountains.  The hotel, in spite of its size, is excellent,</p>
<p>and a few steps up the valley is one of the finest views in the</p>
<p>Dolomites.  To the east opens a deep, wild gorge, at the head of</p>
<p>which the pinnacles of the Drei Zinnen are seen; to the south the</p>
<p>Durrensee fills the valley from edge to edge, and reflects in its</p>
<p>pale waters the huge bulk of Monte Cristallo.  It is such a</p>
<p>complete picture, so finished, so compact, so balanced, that one</p>
<p>might think a painter had composed it in a moment of inspiration.</p>
<p>But no painter ever laid such colours on his canvas as those which</p>
<p>are seen here when the cool evening shadows have settled upon the</p>
<p>valley, all gray and green, while the mountains shine above in rosy</p>
<p>Alpenglow, as if transfigured with inward fire.</p>
<p>There is another lake, about three miles north of Landro, called</p>
<p>the Toblacher See, and there I repaired the defeat of Misurina.</p>
<p>The trout at the outlet, by the bridge, were very small, and while</p>
<p>the old fisherman was endeavouring to catch some of them in his new</p>
<p>net, which would not work, I pushed my boat up to the head of the</p>
<p>lake, where the stream came in.  The green water was amazingly</p>
<p>clear, but the current kept the fish with their heads up stream; so</p>
<p>that one could come up behind them near enough for a long cast,</p>
<p>without being seen.  As my fly lighted above them and came gently</p>
<p>down with the ripple, I saw the first fish turn and rise and take</p>
<p>it.  A motion of the wrist hooked him, and he played just as gamely</p>
<p>as a trout in my favourite Long Island pond.  How different the</p>
<p>colour, though, as he came out of the water.  This fellow was all</p>
<p>silvery, with light pink spots on his sides.  I took seven of his</p>
<p>companions, in weight some four pounds, and then stopped because</p>
<p>the evening light was failing.</p>
<p>How pleasant it is to fish in such a place and at such an hour!</p>
<p>The novelty of the scene, the grandeur of the landscape, lend a</p>
<p>strange charm to the sport.  But the sport itself is so familiar</p>
<p>that one feels at home--the motion of the rod, the feathery swish</p>
<p>of the line, the sight of the rising fish--it all brings back a</p>
<p>hundred woodland memories, and thoughts of good fishing comrades,</p>
<p>some far away across the sea, and, perhaps, even now sitting around</p>
<p>the forest camp-fire in Maine or Canada, and some with whom we</p>
<p>shall keep company no more until we cross the greater ocean into</p>
<p>that happy country whither they have preceded us.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Instead of going straight down the valley by the high road, a drive</p>
<p>of an hour, to the railway in the Pusterthal, I walked up over the</p>
<p>mountains to the east, across the Platzwiesen, and so down through</p>
<p>the Pragserthal.  In one arm of the deep fir-clad vale are the</p>
<p>Baths of Alt-Prags, famous for having cured the Countess of Gorz of</p>
<p>a violent rheumatism in the fifteenth century.  It is an antiquated</p>
<p>establishment, and the guests, who were walking about in the fields</p>
<p>or drinking their coffee in the balcony, had a fifteenth century</p>
<p>look about them--venerable but slightly ruinous.  But perhaps that</p>
<p>was merely a rheumatic result.</p>
<p>All the waggons in the place were engaged.  It is strange what an</p>
<p>aggravating effect this state of affairs has upon a pedestrian who</p>
<p>is bent upon riding.  I did not recover my delight in the scenery</p>
<p>until I had walked about five miles farther, and sat down on the</p>
<p>grass, beside a beautiful spring, to eat my lunch.</p>
<p>What is there in a little physical rest that has such magic to</p>
<p>restore the sense of pleasure?  A few moments ago nothing pleased</p>
<p>you--the bloom was gone from the peach; but now it has come back</p>
<p>again--you wonder and admire.  Thus cheerful and contented I</p>
<p>trudged up the right arm of the valley to the Baths of Neu-Prags,</p>
<p>less venerable, but apparently more popular than Alt-Prags, and on</p>
<p>beyond them, through the woods, to the superb Pragser-Wildsee, a</p>
<p>lake whose still waters, now blue as sapphire under the clear sky,</p>
<p>and now green as emerald under gray clouds, sleep encircled by</p>
<p>mighty precipices.  Could anything be a greater contrast with</p>
<p>Venice?  There the canals alive with gondolas, and the open harbour</p>
<p>bright with many-coloured sails; here, the hidden lake, silent and</p>
<p>lifeless, save when</p>

<p>Tired, and a little foot-sore, after nine hours&#x27; walking, I came</p>
<p>into the big railway hotel at Toblach that night.  There I met my</p>
<p>friends again, and parted from them and the Dolomites the next day,</p>
<p>with regret.  For they were &quot;stepping westward;&quot; but in order to</p>
<p>get to the Gross-Venediger I must make a detour to the east,</p>
<p>through the Pusterthal, and come up through the valley of the Isel</p>
<p>to the great chain of mountains called the Hohe Tauern.</p>
<p>At the junction of the Isel and the Drau lies the quaint little</p>
<p>city of Lienz, with its two castles--the square, double-towered one</p>
<p>in the town, now transformed into the offices of the municipality,</p>
<p>and the huge mediaeval one on a hill outside, now used as a damp</p>
<p>restaurant and dismal beer-cellar.  I lingered at Lienz for a</p>
<p>couple of days, in the ancient hostelry of the Post.  The hallways</p>
<p>were vaulted like a cloister, the walls were three feet thick, the</p>
<p>kitchen was in the middle of the house on the second floor, so that</p>
<p>I looked into it every time I came from my room, and ordered dinner</p>
<p>direct from the cook.  But, so far from being displeased with these</p>
<p>peculiarities, I rather liked the flavour of them; and then, in</p>
<p>addition, the landlady&#x27;s daughter, who was managing the house, was</p>
<p>a person of most engaging manners, and there was trout and grayling</p>
<p>fishing in a stream near by, and the neighbouring church of Dolsach</p>
<p>contained the beautiful picture of the Holy Family, which Franz</p>
<p>Defregger painted for his native village.</p>
<p>The peasant women of Lienz have one very striking feature in their</p>
<p>dress--a black felt hat with a broad, stiff brim and a high crown,</p>
<p>smaller at the top than at the base.  It looks a little like the</p>
<p>traditional head-gear of the Pilgrim Fathers, exaggerated.  There</p>
<p>is a solemnity about it which is fatal to feminine beauty.</p>
<p>I went by the post-waggon, with two slow horses and ten passengers,</p>
<p>fifteen miles up the Iselthal, to Windisch-Matrei, a village whose</p>
<p>early history is lost in the mist of antiquity, and whose streets</p>
<p>are pervaded with odours which must have originated at the same</p>
<p>time with the village.  One wishes that they also might have shared</p>
<p>the fate of its early history.  But it is not fair to expect too</p>
<p>much of a small place, and Windisch-Matrei has certainly a</p>
<p>beautiful situation and a good inn.  There I took my guide--a wiry</p>
<p>and companionable little man, whose occupation in the lower world</p>
<p>was that of a maker and merchant of hats--and set out for the</p>
<p>Pragerhutte, a shelter on the side of the Gross-Venediger.</p>
<p>The path led under the walls of the old Castle of Weissenstein, and</p>
<p>then in steep curves up the cliff which blocks the head of the</p>
<p>valley, and along a cut in the face of the rock, into the steep,</p>
<p>narrow Tauernthal, which divides the Glockner group from the</p>
<p>Venediger.  How entirely different it was from the region of the</p>
<p>Dolomites!  There the variety of colour was endless and the change</p>
<p>incessant; here it was all green grass and trees and black rocks,</p>
<p>with glimpses of snow.  There the highest mountains were in sight</p>
<p>constantly; here they could only be seen from certain points in the</p>
<p>valley.  There the streams played but a small part in the</p>
<p>landscape; here they were prominent, the main river raging and</p>
<p>foaming through the gorge below, while a score of waterfalls leaped</p>
<p>from the cliffs on either side and dashed down to join it.</p>
<p>The peasants, men, women and children, were cutting the grass in</p>
<p>the perpendicular fields; the woodmen were trimming and felling the</p>
<p>trees in the fir-forests; the cattle-tenders were driving their</p>
<p>cows along the stony path, or herding them far up on the hillsides.</p>
<p>It was a lonely scene, and yet a busy one; and all along the road</p>
<p>was written the history of the perils and hardships of the life</p>
<p>which now seemed so peaceful and picturesque under the summer</p>
<p>sunlight.</p>
<p>These heavy crosses, each covered with a narrow, pointed roof and</p>
<p>decorated with a rude picture, standing beside the path, or on the</p>
<p>bridge, or near the mill--what do they mean?  They mark the place</p>
<p>where a human life has been lost, or where some poor peasant has</p>
<p>been delivered from a great peril, and has set up a memorial of his</p>
<p>gratitude.</p>
<p>Stop, traveller, as you pass by, and look at the pictures.  They</p>
<p>have little more of art than a child&#x27;s drawing on a slate; but they</p>
<p>will teach you what it means to earn a living in these mountains.</p>
<p>They tell of the danger that lurks on the steep slopes of grass,</p>
<p>where the mowers have to go down with ropes around their waists,</p>
<p>and in the beds of the streams where the floods sweep through in</p>
<p>the spring, and in the forests where the great trees fall and crush</p>
<p>men like flies, and on the icy bridges where a slip is fatal, and</p>
<p>on the high passes where the winter snowstorm blinds the eyes and</p>
<p>benumbs the limbs of the traveller, and under the cliffs from which</p>
<p>avalanches slide and rocks roll. They show you men and women</p>
<p>falling from waggons, and swept away by waters, and overwhelmed in</p>
<p>land-slips.  In the corner of the picture you may see a peasant</p>
<p>with the black cross above his head--that means death.  Or perhaps</p>
<p>it is deliverance that the tablet commemorates--and then you will</p>
<p>see the miller kneeling beside his mill with a flood rushing down</p>
<p>upon it, or a peasant kneeling in his harvest-field under an</p>
<p>inky-black cloud, or a landlord beside his inn in flames, or a</p>
<p>mother praying beside her sick children; and above appears an</p>
<p>angel, or a saint, or the Virgin with her Child.</p>
<p>Read the inscriptions, too, in their quaint German.  Some of them</p>
<p>are as humourous as the epitaphs in New England graveyards.  I</p>
<p>remember one which ran like this:</p>

<p>But for the most part a glance at these Marterl und Taferl, which</p>
<p>are so frequent on all the mountain-roads of the Tyrol, will give</p>
<p>you a strange sense of the real pathos of human life.  If you are a</p>
<p>Catholic, you will not refuse their request to say a prayer for the</p>
<p>departed; if you are a Protestant, at least it will not hurt you to</p>
<p>say one for those who still live and suffer and toil among such</p>
<p>dangers.</p>
<p>After we had walked for four hours up the Tauernthal, we came to</p>
<p>the Matreier-Tauernhaus, an inn which is kept open all the year for</p>
<p>the shelter of travellers over the high pass that crosses the</p>
<p>mountain-range at this point, from north to south.  There we dined.</p>
<p>It was a bare, rude place, but the dish of juicy trout was</p>
<p>garnished with flowers, each fish holding a big pansy in its mouth,</p>
<p>and as the maid set them down before me she wished me &quot;a good</p>
<p>appetite,&quot; with the hearty old-fashioned Tyrolese courtesy which</p>
<p>still survives in these remote valleys.  It is pleasant to travel</p>
<p>in a land where the manners are plain and good.  If you meet a</p>
<p>peasant on the road he says, &quot;God greet you!&quot; if you give a child a</p>
<p>couple of kreuzers he folds his hands and says, &quot;God reward you!&quot;</p>
<p>and the maid who lights you to bed says, &quot;Goodnight, I hope you</p>
<p>will sleep well!&quot;</p>
<p>Two hours more of walking brought us through Ausser-gschloss and</p>
<p>Inner-gschloss, two groups of herdsmen&#x27;s huts, tenanted only in</p>
<p>summer, at the head of the Tauernthal.  Midway between them lies a</p>
<p>little chapel, cut into the solid rock for shelter from the</p>
<p>avalanches.  This lofty vale is indeed rightly named; for it is</p>
<p>shut off from the rest of the world.  The portal is a cliff down</p>
<p>which the stream rushes in foam and thunder.  On either hand rises</p>
<p>a mountain wall.  Within, the pasture is fresh and green, sprinkled</p>
<p>with Alpine roses, and the pale river flows swiftly down between</p>
<p>the rows of dark wooden houses.  At the head of the vale towers the</p>
<p>Gross-Venediger, with its glaciers and snow-fields dazzling white</p>
<p>against the deep blue heaven.  The murmur of the stream and the</p>
<p>tinkle of the cow-bells and the jodelling of the herdsmen far up</p>
<p>the slopes, make the music for the scene.</p>
<p>The path from Gschloss leads straight up to the foot of the dark</p>
<p>pyramid of the Kesselkopf, and then in steep endless zig-zags along</p>
<p>the edge of the great glacier.  I saw, at first, the pinnacles of</p>
<p>ice far above me, breaking over the face of the rock; then, after</p>
<p>an hour&#x27;s breathless climbing, I could look right into the blue</p>
<p>crevasses; and at last, after another hour over soft snow-fields</p>
<p>and broken rocks, I was at the Pragerhut, perched on the shoulder</p>
<p>of the mountain, looking down upon the huge river of ice.</p>
<p>It was a magnificent view under the clear light of evening.  Here</p>
<p>in front of us, the Venediger with all his brother-mountains</p>
<p>clustered about him; behind us, across the Tauern, the mighty chain</p>
<p>of the Glockner against the eastern sky.</p>
<p>This is the frozen world.  Here the Winter, driven back into his</p>
<p>stronghold, makes his last stand against the Summer, in perpetual</p>
<p>conflict, retreating by day to the mountain-peak, but creeping back</p>
<p>at night in frost and snow to regain a little of his lost</p>
<p>territory, until at last the Summer is wearied out, and the Winter</p>
<p>sweeps down again to claim the whole valley for his own.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>In the Pragerhut I found mountain comfort.  There were bunks along</p>
<p>the wall of the guest-room, with plenty of blankets.  There was</p>
<p>good store of eggs, canned meats, and nourishing black bread.  The</p>
<p>friendly goats came bleating up to the door at nightfall to be</p>
<p>milked.  And in charge of all this luxury there was a cheerful</p>
<p>peasant-wife with her brown-eyed daughter, to entertain travellers.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant sight to see them, as they sat down to their</p>
<p>supper with my guide; all three bowed their heads and said their</p>
<p>&quot;grace before meat,&quot; the guide repeating the longer prayer and the</p>
<p>mother and daughter coming in with the responses.  I went to bed</p>
<p>with a warm and comfortable feeling about my heart.  It was a good</p>
<p>ending for the day.  In the morning, if the weather remained clear,</p>
<p>the alarm-clock was to wake us at three for the ascent to the</p>
<p>summit.</p>
<p>But can it be three o&#x27;clock already.  The gibbous moon still hangs</p>
<p>in the sky and casts a feeble light over the scene.  Then up and</p>
<p>away for the final climb.  How rough the path is among the black</p>
<p>rocks along the ridge!  Now we strike out on the gently rising</p>
<p>glacier, across the crust of snow, picking our way among the</p>
<p>crevasses, with the rope tied about our waists for fear of a fall.</p>
<p>How cold it is!  But now the gray light of morning dawns, and now</p>
<p>the beams of sunrise shoot up behind the Glockner, and now the sun</p>
<p>itself glitters into sight.  The snow grows softer as we toil up</p>
<p>the steep, narrow comb between the Gross-Venediger and his</p>
<p>neighbour the Klein-Venediger.  At last we have reached our</p>
<p>journey&#x27;s end.  See, the whole of the Tyrol is spread out before us</p>
<p>in wondrous splendour, as we stand on this snowy ridge; and at our</p>
<p>feet the Schlatten glacier, like a long, white snake, curls down</p>
<p>into the valley.</p>
<p>There is still a little peak above us; an overhanging horn of snow</p>
<p>which the wind has built against the mountain-top.  I would like to</p>
<p>stand there, just for a moment.  The guide protests it would be</p>
<p>dangerous, for if the snow should break it would be a fall of a</p>
<p>thousand feet to the glacier on the northern side.  But let us dare</p>
<p>the few steps upward.  How our feet sink!  Is the snow slipping?</p>
<p>Look at the glacier!  What is happening?  It is wrinkling and</p>
<p>curling backward on us, serpent-like.  Its head rises far above us.</p>
<p>All its icy crests are clashing together like the ringing of a</p>
<p>thousand bells.  We are falling!  I fling out my arm to grasp the</p>
<p>guide--and awake to find myself clutching a pillow in the bunk.</p>
<p>The alarm-clock is ringing fiercely for three o&#x27;clock.  A driving</p>
<p>snow-storm is beating against the window.  The ground is white.</p>
<p>Peer through the clouds as I may, I cannot even catch a glimpse of</p>
<p>the vanished Gross-Venediger.</p>
<ol start="1892">

</ol>
<p>AU LARGE</p>
<p>Wherever we strayed, the same tranquil leisure enfolded us; day</p>
<p>followed day in an order unbroken and peaceful as the unfolding of</p>
<p>the flowers and the silent march of the stars.  Time no longer ran</p>
<p>like the few sands in a delicate hour-glass held by a fragile human</p>
<p>hand, but like a majestic river fed by fathomless seas. . . .  We</p>
<p>gave ourselves up to the sweetness of that unmeasured life, without</p>
<p>thought of yesterday or to-morrow; we drank the cup to-day held to</p>
<p>our lips, and knew that so long as we were athirst that draught</p>
<p>would not be denied us.&quot; --HAMILTON W. MABIE: Under the Trees.</p>
<p>There is magic in words, surely, and many a treasure besides Ali</p>
<p>Baba&#x27;s is unlocked with a verbal key.  Some charm in the mere</p>
<p>sound, some association with the pleasant past, touches a secret</p>
<p>spring.  The bars are down; the gate open; you are made free of all</p>
<p>the fields of memory and fancy--by a word.</p>
<p>Au large!  Envoyez au large! is the cry of the Canadian voyageurs as</p>
<p>they thrust their paddles against the shore and push out on the</p>
<p>broad lake for a journey through the wilderness.  Au large! is what</p>
<p>the man in the bow shouts to the man in the stern when the birch</p>
<p>canoe is running down the rapids, and the water grows too broken,</p>
<p>and the rocks too thick, along the river-bank.  Then the frail bark</p>
<p>must be driven out into the very centre of the wild current, into</p>
<p>the midst of danger to find safety, dashing, like a frightened</p>
<p>colt, along the smooth, sloping lane bordered by white fences of</p>
<p>foam.</p>
<p>Au large!  When I hear that word, I hear also the crisp waves</p>
<p>breaking on pebbly beaches, and the big wind rushing through</p>
<p>innumerable trees, and the roar of headlong rivers leaping down the</p>
<p>rocks, I see long reaches of water sparkling in the sun, or</p>
<p>sleeping still between evergreen walls beneath a cloudy sky; and</p>
<p>the gleam of white tents on the shore; and the glow of firelight</p>
<p>dancing through the woods.  I smell the delicate vanishing perfume</p>
<p>of forest flowers; and the incense of rolls of birch-bark,</p>
<p>crinkling and flaring in the camp-fire; and the soothing odour of</p>
<p>balsam-boughs piled deep for woodland beds--the veritable and only</p>
<p>genuine perfume of the land of Nod.  The thin shining veil of the</p>
<p>Northern lights waves and fades and brightens over the night sky;</p>
<p>at the sound of the word, as at the ringing of a bell, the curtain</p>
<p>rises.  Scene, the Forest of Arden; enter a party of hunters.</p>
<p>It was in the Lake St. John country, two hundred miles north of</p>
<p>Quebec, that I first heard my rustic incantation; and it seemed to</p>
<p>fit the region as if it had been made for it.  This is not a little</p>
<p>pocket wilderness like the Adirondacks, but something vast and</p>
<p>primitive.  You do not cross it, from one railroad to another, by a</p>
<p>line of hotels.  You go into it by one river as far as you like, or</p>
<p>dare; and then you turn and come back again by another river,</p>
<p>making haste to get out before your provisions are exhausted.  The</p>
<p>lake itself is the cradle of the mighty Saguenay: an inland sea,</p>
<p>thirty miles across and nearly round, lying in the broad limestone</p>
<p>basin north of the Laurentian Mountains.  The southern and eastern</p>
<p>shores have been settled for twenty or thirty years; and the rich</p>
<p>farm-land yields abundant crops of wheat and oats and potatoes to a</p>
<p>community of industrious habitants, who live in little modern</p>
<p>villages, named after the saints and gathered as closely as</p>
<p>possible around big gray stone churches, and thank the good Lord</p>
<p>that he has given them a climate at least four or five degrees</p>
<p>milder than Quebec.  A railroad, built through a region of granite</p>
<p>hills, which will never be tamed to the plough, links this outlying</p>
<p>settlement to the civilised world; and at the end of the railroad</p>
<p>the Hotel Roberval, standing on a hill above the lake, offers to</p>
<p>the pampered tourist electric lights, and spring-beds, and a wide</p>
<p>veranda from which he can look out across the water into the face</p>
<p>of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Northward and westward the interminable forest rolls away to the</p>
<p>shores of Hudson&#x27;s Bay and the frozen wastes of Labrador.  It is an</p>
<p>immense solitude.  A score of rivers empty into the lake; little</p>
<p>ones like the Pikouabi and La Pipe, and middle-sized ones like the</p>
<p>Ouiatehouan and La Belle Riviere, and big ones like the Mistassini</p>
<p>and the Peribonca; and each of these streams is the clue to a</p>
<p>labyrinth of woods and waters.  The canoe-man who follows it far</p>
<p>enough will find himself among lakes that are not named on any map;</p>
<p>he will camp on virgin ground, and make the acquaintance of</p>
<p>unsophisticated fish; perhaps even, like the maiden in the fairy-</p>
<p>tale, he will meet with the little bear, and the middle-sized bear,</p>
<p>and the great big bear.</p>
<p>Damon and I set out on such an expedition shortly after the nodding</p>
<p>lilies in the Connecticut meadows had rung the noon-tide bell of</p>
<p>summer, and when the raspberry bushes along the line of the Quebec</p>
<p>and Lake St. John Railway had spread their afternoon collation for</p>
<p>birds and men.  At Roberval we found our four guides waiting for</p>
<p>us, and the steamboat took us all across the lake to the Island</p>
<p>House, at the northeast corner.  There we embarked our tents and</p>
<p>blankets, our pots and pans, and bags of flour and potatoes and</p>
<p>bacon and other delicacies, our rods and guns, and last, but not</p>
<p>least, our axes (without which man in the woods is a helpless</p>
<p>creature), in two birch-bark canoes, and went flying down the</p>
<p>Grande Decharge.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful place, this outlet of Lake St. John.  All the</p>
<p>floods of twenty rivers are gathered here, and break forth through</p>
<p>a net of islands in a double stream, divided by the broad Ile</p>
<p>d&#x27;Alma, into the Grande Decharge and the Petite Decharge.  The</p>
<p>southern outlet is small, and flows somewhat more quietly at first.</p>
<p>But the northern outlet is a huge confluence and tumult of waters.</p>
<p>You see the set of the tide far out in the lake, sliding, driving,</p>
<p>crowding, hurrying in with smooth currents and swirling eddies,</p>
<p>toward the corner of escape.  By the rocky cove where the Island</p>
<p>House peers out through the fir-trees, the current already has a</p>
<p>perceptible slope.  It begins to boil over hidden stones in the</p>
<p>middle, and gurgles at projecting points of rock.  A mile farther</p>
<p>down there is an islet where the stream quickens, chafes, and</p>
<p>breaks into a rapid.  Behind the islet it drops down in three or</p>
<p>four foaming steps.  On the outside it makes one long, straight</p>
<p>rush into a line of white-crested standing waves.</p>
<p>As we approached, the steersman in the first canoe stood up to look</p>
<p>over the course.  The sea was high.  Was it too high?  The canoes</p>
<p>were heavily loaded.  Could they leap the waves?  There was a quick</p>
<p>talk among the guides as we slipped along, undecided which way to</p>
<p>turn.  Then the question seemed to settle itself, as most of these</p>
<p>woodland questions do, as if some silent force of Nature had the</p>
<p>casting-vote.  &quot;Sautez, sautez!&quot; cried Ferdinand, &quot;envoyez au</p>
<p>large!&quot;  In a moment we were sliding down the smooth back of the</p>
<p>rapid, directly toward the first big wave.  The rocky shore went by</p>
<p>us like a dream; we could feel the motion of the earth whirling</p>
<p>around with us.  The crest of the billow in front curled above the</p>
<p>bow of the canoe.  &quot;Arret&#x27;, arret&#x27;, doucement!&quot;  A swift stroke of</p>
<p>the paddle checked the canoe, quivering and prancing like a horse</p>
<p>suddenly reined in.  The wave ahead, as if surprised, sank and</p>
<p>flattened for a second.  The canoe leaped through the edge of it,</p>
<p>swerved to one side, and ran gayly down along the fringe of the</p>
<p>line of billows, into quieter water.</p>
<p>Every one feels the exhilaration of such a descent.  I know a lady</p>
<p>who almost cried with fright when she went down her first rapid,</p>
<p>but before the voyage was ended she was saying:--</p>

<p>It takes a touch of danger to bring out the joy of life.</p>
<p>Our guides began to shout, and joke each other, and praise their</p>
<p>canoes.</p>
<p>&quot;You grazed that villain rock at the corner,&quot; said Jean; &quot;didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>you know where it was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, after I touched it,&quot; cried Ferdinand; &quot;but you took in a</p>
<p>bucket of water, and I suppose your m&#x27;sieu&#x27; is sitting on a piece</p>
<p>of the river.  Is it not?&quot;</p>
<p>This seemed to us all a very merry jest, and we laughed with the</p>
<p>same inextinguishable laughter which a practical joke, according to</p>
<p>Homer, always used to raise in Olympus.  It is one of the charms of</p>
<p>life in the woods that it brings back the high spirits of boyhood</p>
<p>and renews the youth of the world.  Plain fun, like plain food,</p>
<p>tastes good out-of-doors.  Nectar is the sweet sap of a maple-tree.</p>
<p>Ambrosia is only another name for well-turned flapjacks.  And all</p>
<p>the immortals, sitting around the table of golden cedar-slabs, make</p>
<p>merry when the clumsy Hephaistos, playing the part of Hebe,</p>
<p>stumbles over a root and upsets the plate of cakes into the fire.</p>
<p>The first little rapid of the Grande Decharge was only the</p>
<p>beginning.  Half a mile below we could see the river disappear</p>
<p>between two points of rock.  There was a roar of conflict, and a</p>
<p>golden mist hanging in the air, like the smoke of battle.  All</p>
<p>along the place where the river sank from sight, dazzling heads of</p>
<p>foam were flashing up and falling back, as if a horde of water-</p>
<p>sprites were vainly trying to fight their way up to the lake.  It</p>
<p>was the top of the grande chute, a wild succession of falls and</p>
<p>pools where no boat could live for a moment.  We ran down toward it</p>
<p>as far as the water served, and then turned off among the rocks on</p>
<p>the left hand, to take the portage.</p>
<p>These portages are among the troublesome delights of a journey in</p>
<p>the wilderness.  To the guides they mean hard work, for everything,</p>
<p>including the boats, must be carried on their backs.  The march of</p>
<p>the canoes on dry land is a curious sight.  Andrew Marvell</p>

<p>But the sportsman carries nothing, except perhaps his gun, or his</p>
<p>rod, or his photographic camera; and so for him the portage is only</p>
<p>a pleasant opportunity to stretch his legs, cramped by sitting in</p>
<p>the canoe, and to renew his acquaintance with the pretty things</p>
<p>that are in the woods.</p>
<p>We sauntered along the trail, Damon and I, as if school were out</p>
<p>and would never keep again.  How fresh and tonic the forest seemed</p>
<p>as we plunged into its bath of shade.  There were our old friends</p>
<p>the cedars, with their roots twisted across the path; and the white</p>
<p>birches, so trim in youth and so shaggy in age; and the sociable</p>
<p>spruces and balsams, crowding close together, and interlacing their</p>
<p>arms overhead.  There were the little springs, trickling through</p>
<p>the moss; and the slippery logs laid across the marshy places; and</p>
<p>the fallen trees, cut in two and pushed aside,--for this was a</p>
<p>much-travelled portage.</p>
<p>Around the open spaces, the tall meadow-rue stood dressed in robes</p>
<p>of fairy white and green.  The blue banners of the fleur-de-lis</p>
<p>were planted beside the springs.  In shady corners, deeper in the</p>
<p>wood, the fragrant pyrola lifted its scape of clustering bells,</p>
<p>like a lily of the valley wandered to the forest.  When we came to</p>
<p>the end of the portage, a perfume like that of cyclamens in</p>
<p>Tyrolean meadows welcomed us, and searching among the loose grasses</p>
<p>by the water-side we found the exquisite purple spikes of the</p>
<p>lesser fringed orchis, loveliest and most ethereal of all the</p>
<p>woodland flowers save one.  And what one is that?  Ah, my friend,</p>
<p>it is your own particular favourite, the flower, by whatever name</p>
<p>you call it, that you plucked long ago when you were walking in the</p>
<p>forest with your sweetheart,--</p>

<p>We launched our canoes again on the great pool at the foot of the</p>
<p>first fall,--a broad sweep of water a mile long and half a mile</p>
<p>wide, full of eddies and strong currents, and covered with drifting</p>
<p>foam.  There was the old campground on the point, where I had</p>
<p>tented so often with my lady Greygown, fishing for ouananiche, the</p>
<p>famous land-locked salmon of Lake St. John.  And there were the big</p>
<p>fish, showing their back fins as they circled lazily around in the</p>
<p>eddies, as if they were waiting to play with us.  But the goal of</p>
<p>our day&#x27;s journey was miles away, and we swept along with the</p>
<p>stream, now through a rush of quick water, boiling and foaming, now</p>
<p>through a still place like a lake, now through</p>

<p>The beauty of the shores was infinitely varied, and unspoiled by</p>
<p>any sign of the presence of man.  We met no company except a few</p>
<p>king-fishers, and a pair of gulls who had come up from the sea to</p>
<p>spend the summer, and a large flock of wild ducks, which the guides</p>
<p>call &quot;Betseys,&quot; as if they were all of the gentler sex.  In such a</p>
<p>big family of girls we supposed that a few would not be missed, and</p>
<p>Damon bagged two of the tenderest for our supper.</p>
<p>In the still water at the mouth of the Riviere Mistook, just above</p>
<p>the Rapide aux Cedres, we went ashore on a level wooded bank to</p>
<p>make our first camp and cook our dinner.  Let me try to sketch our</p>
<p>men as they are busied about the fire.</p>
<p>They are all French Canadians of unmixed blood, descendants of the</p>
<p>men who came to New France with Samuel de Champlain, that</p>
<p>incomparable old woodsman and life-long lover of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Ferdinand Larouche is our chef--there must be a head in every party</p>
<p>for the sake of harmony--and his assistant is his brother Francois.</p>
<p>Ferdinand is a stocky little fellow, a &quot;sawed off&quot; man, not more</p>
<p>than five feet two inches tall, but every inch of him is pure vim.</p>
<p>He can carry a big canoe or a hundred-weight of camp stuff over a</p>
<p>mile portage without stopping to take breath.  He is a capital</p>
<p>canoe-man, with prudence enough to balance his courage, and a fair</p>
<p>cook, with plenty of that quality which is wanting in the ordinary</p>
<p>cook of commerce--good humour.  Always joking, whistling, singing,</p>
<p>he brings the atmosphere of a perpetual holiday along with him.</p>
<p>His weather-worn coat covers a heart full of music.  He has two</p>
<p>talents which make him a marked man among his comrades.  He plays</p>
<p>the fiddle to the delight of all the balls and weddings through the</p>
<p>country-side; and he speaks English to the admiration and envy of</p>
<p>the other guides.  But like all men of genius he is modest about</p>
<p>his accomplishments.  &quot;H&#x27;I not spik good h&#x27;English--h&#x27;only for</p>
<p>camp--fishin&#x27;, cookin&#x27;, dhe voyage--h&#x27;all dhose t&#x27;ings.&quot;  The</p>
<p>aspirates puzzle him.  He can get though a slash of fallen timber</p>
<p>more easily than a sentence full of &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that.&quot;  Sometimes</p>
<p>he expresses his meaning queerly.  He was telling me once about his</p>
<p>farm, &quot;not far off here, in dhe Riviere au Cochon, river of dhe</p>
<p>pig, you call &#x27;im.  H&#x27;I am a widow, got five sons, t&#x27;ree of dhem</p>
<p>are girls.&quot;  But he usually ends by falling back into French,</p>
<p>which, he assures you, you speak to perfection, &quot;much better than</p>
<p>the Canadians; the French of Paris in short--M&#x27;sieu&#x27; has been in</p>
<p>Paris?&quot;  Such courtesy is born in the blood, and is irresistible.</p>
<p>You cannot help returning the compliment and assuring him that his</p>
<p>English is remarkable, good enough for all practical purposes,</p>
<p>better than any of the other guides can speak.  And so it is.</p>
<p>Francois is a little taller, a little thinner, and considerably</p>
<p>quieter than Ferdinand.  He laughs loyally at his brother&#x27;s jokes,</p>
<p>and sings the response to his songs, and wields a good second</p>
<p>paddle in the canoe.</p>
<p>Jean--commonly called Johnny--Morel is a tall, strong man of fifty,</p>
<p>with a bushy red beard that would do credit to a pirate.  But when</p>
<p>you look at him more closely, you see that he has a clear, kind</p>
<p>blue eye and a most honest, friendly face under his slouch hat.  He</p>
<p>has travelled these woods and waters for thirty years, so that he</p>
<p>knows the way through them by a thousand familiar signs, as well as</p>
<p>you know the streets of the city.  He is our pathfinder.</p>
<p>The bow paddle in his canoe is held by his son Joseph, a lad not</p>
<p>quite fifteen, but already as tall, and almost as strong as a man.</p>
<p>&quot;He is yet of the youth,&quot; said Johnny, &quot;and he knows not the</p>
<p>affairs of the camp.  This trip is for him the first--it is his</p>
<p>school--but I hope he will content you.  He is good, M&#x27;sieu&#x27;, and</p>
<p>of the strongest for his age.  I have educated already two sons in</p>
<p>the bow of my canoe.  The oldest has gone to Pennsylvanie; he peels</p>
<p>the bark there for the tanning of leather.  The second had the</p>
<p>misfortune of breaking his leg, so that he can no longer kneel to</p>
<p>paddle.  He has descended to the making of shoes.  Joseph is my</p>
<p>third pupil.  And I have still a younger one at home waiting to</p>
<p>come into my school.&quot;</p>
<p>A touch of family life like that is always refreshing, and doubly</p>
<p>so in the wilderness.  For what is fatherhood at its best,</p>
<p>everywhere, but the training of good men to take the teacher&#x27;s</p>
<p>place when his work is done?  Some day, when Johnny&#x27;s rheumatism</p>
<p>has made his joints a little stiffer and his eyes have lost</p>
<p>something of their keenness, he will be wielding the second paddle</p>
<p>in the boat, and going out only on the short and easy trips.  It</p>
<p>will be young Joseph that steers the canoe through the dangerous</p>
<p>places, and carries the heaviest load over the portages, and leads</p>
<p>the way on the long journeys.</p>
<p>It has taken me longer to describe our men than it took them to</p>
<p>prepare our frugal meal: a pot of tea, the woodsman&#x27;s favourite</p>
<p>drink, (I never knew a good guide that would not go without whisky</p>
<p>rather than without tea,) a few slices of toast and juicy rashers</p>
<p>of bacon, a kettle of boiled potatoes, and a relish of crackers and</p>
<p>cheese.  We were in a hurry to be off for an afternoon&#x27;s fishing,</p>
<p>three or four miles down the river, at the Ile Maligne.</p>
<p>The island is well named, for it is the most perilous place on the</p>
<p>river, and has a record of disaster and death.  The scattered</p>
<p>waters of the Discharge are drawn together here into one deep,</p>
<p>narrow, powerful stream, flowing between gloomy shores of granite.</p>
<p>In mid-channel the wicked island shows its scarred and bristling</p>
<p>head, like a giant ready to dispute the passage.  The river rushes</p>
<p>straight at the rocky brow, splits into two currents, and raves</p>
<p>away on both sides of the island in a double chain of furious falls</p>
<p>and rapids.</p>
<p>In these wild waters we fished with immense delight and fair</p>
<p>success, scrambling down among the huge rocks along the shore, and</p>
<p>joining the excitement of an Alpine climb with the placid pleasures</p>
<p>of angling.  At nightfall we were at home again in our camp, with</p>
<p>half a score of onananiche, weighing from one to four pounds each.</p>
<p>Our next day&#x27;s journey was long and variegated.  A portage of a</p>
<p>mile or two across the Ile d&#x27;Alma, with a cart to haul our canoes</p>
<p>and stuff, brought us to the Little Discharge, down which we</p>
<p>floated for a little way, and then hauled through the village of</p>
<p>St. Joseph to the foot of the Carcajou, or Wildcat Falls.  A mile</p>
<p>of quick water was soon passed, and we came to the junction of the</p>
<p>Little Discharge with the Grand Discharge at the point where the</p>
<p>picturesque club-house stands in a grove of birches beside the big</p>
<p>Vache Caille Falls.  It is lively work crossing the pool here, when</p>
<p>the water is high and the canoes are heavy; but we went through the</p>
<p>labouring seas safely, and landed some distance below, at the head</p>
<p>of the Rapide Gervais, to eat our lunch.  The water was too rough</p>
<p>to run down with loaded boats, so Damon and I had to walk about</p>
<p>three miles along the river-bank, while the men went down with the</p>
<p>canoes.</p>
<p>On our way beside the rapids, Damon geologised, finding the marks</p>
<p>of ancient glaciers, and bits of iron-ore, and pockets of sand full</p>
<p>of infinitesimal garnets, and specks of gold washed from the</p>
<p>primitive granite; and I fished, picking up a pair of ouananiche in</p>
<p>foam-covered nooks among the rocks.  The swift water was almost</p>
<p>passed when we embarked again and ran down the last slope into a</p>
<p>long deadwater.</p>
<p>The shores, at first bold and rough, covered with dense thickets of</p>
<p>second-growth timber, now became smoother and more fertile.</p>
<p>Scattered farms, with square, unpainted houses, and long, thatched</p>
<p>barns, began to creep over the hills toward the river.  There was a</p>
<p>hamlet, called St. Charles, with a rude little church and a</p>
<p>campanile of logs.  The cure, robed in decent black and wearing a</p>
<p>tall silk hat of the vintage of 1860, sat on the veranda of his</p>
<p>trim presbytery, looking down upon us, like an image of propriety</p>
<p>smiling at Bohemianism.  Other craft appeared on the river.  A man</p>
<p>and his wife paddling an old dugout, with half a dozen children</p>
<p>packed in amidships a crew of lumbermen, in a sharp-nosed bateau,</p>
<p>picking up stray logs along the banks; a couple of boatloads of</p>
<p>young people returning merrily from a holiday visit; a party of</p>
<p>berry-pickers in a flat-bottomed skiff; all the life of the</p>
<p>country-side was in evidence on the river.  We felt quite as if we</p>
<p>had been &quot;in the swim&quot; of society, when at length we reached the</p>
<p>point where the Riviere des Aunes came tumbling down a hundred-foot</p>
<p>ladder of broken black rocks.  There we pitched our tents in a</p>
<p>strip of meadow by the water-side, where we could have the sound of</p>
<p>the falls for a slumber-song all night and the whole river for a</p>
<p>bath at sunrise.</p>
<p>A sparkling draught of crystal weather was poured into our stirrup-</p>
<p>cup in the morning, as we set out for a drive of fifteen miles</p>
<p>across country to the Riviere a l&#x27;Ours, a tributary of the crooked,</p>
<p>unnavigable river of Alders.  The canoes and luggage were loaded on</p>
<p>a couple of charrettes, or two-wheeled carts.  But for us and the</p>
<p>guides there were two quatre-roues, the typical vehicles of the</p>
<p>century, as characteristic of Canada as the carriole is of Norway.</p>
<p>It is a two-seated buckboard, drawn by one horse, and the back seat</p>
<p>is covered with a hood like an old-fashioned poke bonnet.  The road</p>
<p>is of clay and always rutty.  It runs level for a while, and then</p>
<p>jumps up a steep ridge and down again, or into a deep gully and out</p>
<p>again.  The habitant&#x27;s idea of good driving is to let his horse</p>
<p>slide down the hill and gallop up.  This imparts a spasmodic</p>
<p>quality to the motion, like Carlyle&#x27;s style.</p>
<p>The native houses are strung along the road.  The modern pattern</p>
<p>has a convex angle in the roof, and dormer-windows; it is a rustic</p>
<p>adaptation of the Mansard.  The antique pattern, which is far more</p>
<p>picturesque, has a concave curve in the roof, and the eaves project</p>
<p>like eyebrows, shading the flatness of the face.  Paint is a</p>
<p>rarity.  The prevailing colour is the soft gray of weather-beaten</p>
<p>wood.  Sometimes, in the better class of houses, a gallery is built</p>
<p>across the front and around one side, and a square of garden is</p>
<p>fenced in, with dahlias and hollyhocks and marigolds, and perhaps a</p>
<p>struggling rosebush, and usually a small patch of tobacco growing</p>
<p>in one corner.  Once in a long while you may see a balm-of-Gilead</p>
<p>tree, or a clump of sapling poplars, planted near the door.</p>
<p>How much better it would have been if the farmer had left a few of</p>
<p>the noble forest-trees to shade his house.  But then, when the</p>
<p>farmer came into the wilderness he was not a farmer, he was first</p>
<p>of all a wood-chopper.  He regarded the forest as a stubborn enemy</p>
<p>in possession of his land.  He attacked it with fire and axe and</p>
<p>exterminated it, instead of keeping a few captives to hold their</p>
<p>green umbrellas over his head when at last his grain fields should</p>
<p>be smiling around him and he should sit down on his doorstep to</p>
<p>smoke a pipe of home-grown tobacco.</p>
<p>In the time of adversity one should prepare for prosperity.  I</p>
<p>fancy there are a good many people unconsciously repeating the</p>
<p>mistake of the Canadian farmer--chopping down all the native</p>
<p>growths of life, clearing the ground of all the useless pretty</p>
<p>things that seem to cumber it, sacrificing everything to utility</p>
<p>and success.  We fell the last green tree for the sake of raising</p>
<p>an extra hill of potatoes; and never stop to think what an ugly,</p>
<p>barren place we may have to sit in while we eat them.  The ideals,</p>
<p>the attachments--yes, even the dreams of youth are worth saving.</p>
<p>For the artificial tastes with which age tries to make good their</p>
<p>loss grow very slowly and cast but a slender shade.</p>
<p>Most of the Canadian farmhouses have their ovens out-of-doors.  We</p>
<p>saw them everywhere; rounded edifices of clay, raised on a</p>
<p>foundation of logs, and usually covered with a pointed roof of</p>
<p>boards.  They looked like little family chapels--and so they were;</p>
<p>shrines where the ritual of the good housewife was celebrated, and</p>
<p>the gift of daily bread, having been honestly earned, was</p>
<p>thankfully received.</p>
<p>At one house we noticed a curious fragment of domestic economy.</p>
<p>Half a pig was suspended over the chimney, and the smoke of the</p>
<p>summer fire was turned to account in curing the winter&#x27;s meat.  I</p>
<p>guess the children of that family had a peculiar fondness for the</p>
<p>parental roof-tree.  We saw them making mud-pies in the road, and</p>
<p>imagined that they looked lovingly up at the pendent porker,</p>
<p>outlined against the sky,--a sign of promise, prophetic of bacon.</p>
<p>About noon the road passed beyond the region of habitation into a</p>
<p>barren land, where blueberries were the only crop, and partridges</p>
<p>took the place of chickens.  Through this rolling gravelly plain,</p>
<p>sparsely wooded and glowing with the tall magenta bloom of the</p>
<p>fireweed, we drove toward the mountains, until the road went to</p>
<p>seed and we could follow it no longer.  Then we took to the water</p>
<p>and began to pole our canoes up the River of the Bear.  It was a</p>
<p>clear, amber-coloured stream, not more than ten or fifteen yards</p>
<p>wide, running swift and strong, over beds of sand and rounded</p>
<p>pebbles.  The canoes went wallowing and plunging up the narrow</p>
<p>channel, between thick banks of alders, like clumsy sea-monsters.</p>
<p>All the grace with which they move under the strokes of the paddle,</p>
<p>in large waters, was gone.  They looked uncouth and predatory, like</p>
<p>a pair of seals that I once saw swimming far up the river</p>
<p>Ristigouche in chase of fish.  From the bow of each canoe the</p>
<p>landing-net stuck out as a symbol of destruction--after the fashion</p>
<p>of the Dutch admiral who nailed a broom to his masthead.  But it</p>
<p>would have been impossible to sweep the trout out of that little</p>
<p>river by any fair method of angling, for there were millions of</p>
<p>them; not large, but lively, and brilliant, and fat; they leaped in</p>
<p>every bend of the stream.  We trailed our flies, and made quick</p>
<p>casts here and there, as we went along.  It was fishing on the</p>
<p>wing.  And when we pitched our tents in a hurry at nightfall on the</p>
<p>low shore of Lac Sale, among the bushes where firewood was scarce</p>
<p>and there were no sapins for the beds, we were comforted for the</p>
<p>poorness of the camp-ground by the excellence of the trout supper.</p>
<p>It was a bitter cold night for August.  There was a skin of ice on</p>
<p>the water-pail at daybreak.  We were glad to be up and away for an</p>
<p>early start.  The river grew wilder and more difficult.  There were</p>
<p>rapids, and ruined dams built by the lumbermen years ago.  At these</p>
<p>places the trout were larger, and so plentiful that it was easy to</p>
<p>hook two at a cast.  It came on to rain furiously while we were</p>
<p>eating our lunch.  But we did not seem to mind it any more than the</p>
<p>fish did.  Here and there the river was completely blocked by</p>
<p>fallen trees.  The guides called it bouchee, &quot;corked,&quot; and leaped</p>
<p>out gayly into the water with their axes to &quot;uncork&quot; it.  We passed</p>
<p>through some pretty lakes, unknown to the map-makers, and arrived,</p>
<p>before sundown, at the Lake of the Bear, where we were to spend a</p>
<p>couple of days.  The lake was full of floating logs, and the water,</p>
<p>raised by the heavy rains and the operations of the lumbermen, was</p>
<p>several feet above its usual level.  Nature&#x27;s landing-places were</p>
<p>all blotted out, and we had to explore halfway around the shore</p>
<p>before we could get out comfortably.  We raised the tents on a</p>
<p>small shoulder of a hill, a few rods above the water; and a</p>
<p>glorious camp-fire of birch logs soon made us forget our misery as</p>
<p>though it had not been.</p>
<p>The name of the Lake of the Beautiful Trout made us desire to visit</p>
<p>it.  The portage was said to be only fifty acres long (the arpent</p>
<p>is the popular measure of distance here), but it passed over a</p>
<p>ridge of newly burned land, and was so entangled with ruined woods</p>
<p>and desolate of birds and flowers that it seemed to us at least</p>
<p>five miles.  The lake was charming--a sheet of singularly clear</p>
<p>water, of a pale green tinge, surrounded by wooded hills.  In the</p>
<p>translucent depths trout and pike live together, but whether in</p>
<p>peace or not I cannot tell.  Both of them grow to an enormous size,</p>
<p>but the pike are larger and have more capacious jaws.  One of them</p>
<p>broke my tackle and went off with a silver spoon in his mouth, as</p>
<p>if he had been born to it.  Of course the guides vowed that they</p>
<p>saw him as he passed under the canoe, and declared that he must</p>
<p>weigh thirty or forty pounds.  The spectacles of regret always</p>
<p>magnify.</p>
<p>The trout were coy.  We took only five of them, perfect specimens</p>
<p>of the true Salvelinus fontinalis, with square tails, and carmine</p>
<p>spots on their dark, mottled sides; the largest weighed three</p>
<p>pounds and three-quarters, and the others were almost as heavy.</p>
<p>On our way back to the camp we found the portage beset by</p>
<p>innumerable and bloodthirsty foes.  There are four grades of insect</p>
<p>malignity in the woods.  The mildest is represented by the winged</p>
<p>idiot that John Burroughs&#x27; little boy called a &quot;blunderhead.&quot;  He</p>
<p>dances stupidly before your face, as if lost in admiration, and</p>
<p>finishes his pointless tale by getting in your eye, or down your</p>
<p>throat.  The next grade is represented by the midges.  &quot;Bite &#x27;em no</p>
<p>see &#x27;em,&quot; is the Indian name for these invisible atoms of animated</p>
<p>pepper which settle upon you in the twilight and make your skin</p>
<p>burn like fire.  But their hour is brief, and when they depart they</p>
<p>leave not a bump behind.  One step lower in the scale we find the</p>
<p>mosquito, or rather he finds us, and makes his poisoned mark upon</p>
<p>our skin.  But after all, he has his good qualities.  The mosquito</p>
<p>is a gentlemanly pirate.  He carries his weapon openly, and gives</p>
<p>notice of an attack.  He respects the decencies of life, and does</p>
<p>not strike below the belt, or creep down the back of your neck.</p>
<p>But the black fly is at the bottom of the moral scale.  He is an</p>
<p>unmitigated ruffian, the plug-ugly of the woods.  He looks like a</p>
<p>tiny, immature house-fly, with white legs as if he must be</p>
<p>innocent.  But, in fact, he crawls like a serpent and bites like a</p>
<p>dog.  No portion of the human frame is sacred from his greed.  He</p>
<p>takes his pound of flesh anywhere, and does not scruple to take the</p>
<p>blood with it.  As a rule you can defend yourself, to some degree,</p>
<p>against him, by wearing a head-net, tying your sleeves around your</p>
<p>wrists and your trousers around your ankles, and anointing yourself</p>
<p>with grease, flavoured with pennyroyal, for which cleanly and</p>
<p>honest scent he has a coarse aversion.  But sometimes, especially</p>
<p>on burned land, about the middle of a warm afternoon, when a rain</p>
<p>is threatening, the horde of black flies descend in force and fury</p>
<p>knowing that their time is short.  Then there is no escape.  Suits</p>
<p>of chain armour, Nubian ointments of far-smelling potency, would</p>
<p>not save you.  You must do as our guides did on the portage, submit</p>
<p>to fate and walk along in heroic silence, like Marco Bozzaris</p>
<p>&quot;bleeding at every pore,&quot;--or do as Damon and I did, break into</p>
<p>ejaculations and a run, until you reach a place where you can light</p>
<p>a smudge and hold your head over it.</p>
<p>&quot;And yet,&quot; said my comrade, as we sat coughing and rubbing our eyes</p>
<p>in the painful shelter of the smoke, &quot;there are worse trials than</p>
<p>this in the civilised districts: social enmities, and newspaper</p>
<p>scandals, and religious persecutions.  The blackest fly I ever saw</p>
<p>is the Reverend -----&quot; but here his voice was fortunately choked by</p>
<p>a fit of coughing.</p>
<p>A couple of wandering Indians--descendants of the Montagnais, on</p>
<p>whose hunting domain we were travelling--dropped in at our camp</p>
<p>that night as we sat around the fire.  They gave us the latest news</p>
<p>about the portages on our further journey; how far they had been</p>
<p>blocked with fallen trees, and whether the water was high or low in</p>
<p>the rivers--just as a visitor at home would talk about the effect</p>
<p>of the strikes on the stock market, and the prospects of the newest</p>
<p>organization of the non-voting classes for the overthrow of Tammany</p>
<p>Hall.  Every phase of civilisation or barbarism creates its own</p>
<p>conversational currency.  The weather, like the old Spanish dollar,</p>
<p>is the only coin that passes everywhere.</p>
<p>But our Indians did not carry much small change about them.  They</p>
<p>were dark, silent chaps, soon talked out; and then they sat sucking</p>
<p>their pipes before the fire, (as dumb as their own wooden effigies</p>
<p>in front of a tobacconist&#x27;s shop,) until the spirit moved them, and</p>
<p>they vanished in their canoe down the dark lake.  Our own guides</p>
<p>were very different.  They were as full of conversation as a</p>
<p>spruce-tree is of gum.  When all shallower themes were exhausted</p>
<p>they would discourse of bears and canoes and lumber and fish,</p>
<p>forever.  After Damon and I had left the fire and rolled ourselves</p>
<p>in the blankets in our own tent, we could hear the men going on and</p>
<p>on with their simple jests and endless tales of adventure, until</p>
<p>sleep drowned their voices.</p>
<p>It was the sound of a French chanson that woke us early on the</p>
<p>morning of our departure from the Lake of the Bear.  A gang of</p>
<p>lumbermen were bringing a lot of logs through the lake.  Half-</p>
<p>hidden in the cold gray mist that usually betokens a fine day, and</p>
<p>wet to the waist from splashing about after their unwieldy flock,</p>
<p>these rough fellows were singing at their work as cheerfully as a</p>
<p>party of robins in a cherry-tree at sunrise.  It was like the</p>
<p>miller and the two girls whom Wordsworth saw dancing in their boats</p>
<p>on the Thames:</p>

<p>But our later thoughts of the lumbermen were not altogether</p>
<p>grateful, when we arrived that day, after a mile of portage, at the</p>
<p>little Riviere Blanche, upon which we had counted to float us down</p>
<p>to Lac Tchitagama, and found that they had stolen all its water to</p>
<p>float their logs down the Lake of the Bear.  The poor little river</p>
<p>was as dry as a theological novel.  There was nothing left of it</p>
<p>except the bed and the bones; it was like a Connecticut stream in</p>
<p>the middle of August.  All its pretty secrets were laid bare; all</p>
<p>its music was hushed.  The pools that lingered among the rocks</p>
<p>seemed like big tears; and the voice of the forlorn rivulets that</p>
<p>trickled in here and there, seeking the parent stream, was a voice</p>
<p>of weeping and complaint.</p>
<p>For us the loss meant a hard day&#x27;s work, scrambling over slippery</p>
<p>stones, and splashing through puddles, and forcing a way through</p>
<p>the tangled thickets on the bank, instead of a pleasant two hours&#x27;</p>
<p>run on a swift current.  We ate our dinner on a sandbank in what</p>
<p>was once the middle of a pretty pond; and entered, as the sun was</p>
<p>sinking, a narrow wooded gorge between the hills, completely filled</p>
<p>by a chain of small lakes, where travelling became easy and</p>
<p>pleasant.  The steep shores, clothed with cedar and black spruce</p>
<p>and dark-blue fir-trees, rose sheer from the water; the passage</p>
<p>from lake to lake was a tiny rapid a few yards long, gurgling</p>
<p>through mossy rocks; at the foot of the chain there was a longer</p>
<p>rapid, with a portage beside it.  We emerged from the dense bush</p>
<p>suddenly and found ourselves face to face with Lake Tchitagama.</p>
<p>How the heart expands at such a view!  Nine miles of shining water</p>
<p>lay stretched before us, opening through the mountains that guarded</p>
<p>it on both sides with lofty walls of green and gray, ridge over</p>
<p>ridge, point beyond point, until the vista ended in</p>

<p>At a moment like this one feels a sense of exultation.  It is a new</p>
<p>discovery of the joy of living.  And yet, my friend and I confessed</p>
<p>to each other, there was a tinge of sadness, an inexplicable regret</p>
<p>mingled with our joy.  Was it the thought of how few human eyes had</p>
<p>even seen that lovely vision?  Was it the dim foreboding that we</p>
<p>might never see it again?  Who can explain the secret pathos of</p>
<p>Nature&#x27;s loveliness?  It is a touch of melancholy inherited from</p>
<p>our mother Eve.  It is an unconscious memory of the lost Paradise.</p>
<p>It is the sense that even if we should find another Eden, we would</p>
<p>not be fit to enjoy it perfectly, nor stay in it forever.</p>
<p>Our first camp on Tchitagama was at the sunrise end of the lake, in</p>
<p>a bay paved with small round stones, laid close together and beaten</p>
<p>firmly down by the waves.  There, and along the shores below, at</p>
<p>the mouth of a little river that foamed in over a ledge of granite,</p>
<p>and in the shadow of cliffs of limestone and feldspar, we trolled</p>
<p>and took many fish: pike of enormous size, fresh-water sharks,</p>
<p>devourers of nobler game, fit only to kill and throw away; huge old</p>
<p>trout of six or seven pounds, with broad tails and hooked jaws,</p>
<p>fine fighters and poor food; stupid, wide-mouthed chub--ouitouche,</p>
<p>the Indians call them--biting at hooks that were not baited for</p>
<p>them; and best of all, high-bred onananiche, pleasant to capture</p>
<p>and delicate to eat.</p>
<p>Our second camp was on a sandy point at the sunset end of the lake--</p>
<p>a fine place for bathing, and convenient to the wild meadows and</p>
<p>blueberry patches, where Damon went to hunt for bears.  He did not</p>
<p>find any; but once he heard a great noise in the bushes, which he</p>
<p>thought was a bear; and he declared that he got quite as much</p>
<p>excitement out of it as if it had had four legs and a mouthful of</p>
<p>teeth.</p>
<p>He brought back from one of his expeditions an Indian letter, which</p>
<p>he had found in a cleft stick by the river.  It was a sheet of</p>
<p>birch-bark with a picture drawn on it in charcoal; five Indians in</p>
<p>a canoe paddling up the river, and one in another canoe pointing in</p>
<p>another direction; we read it as a message left by a hunting party,</p>
<p>telling their companions not to go on up the river, because it was</p>
<p>already occupied, but to turn off on a side stream.</p>
<p>There was a sign of a different kind nailed to an old stump behind</p>
<p>our camp.  It was the top of a soap-box, with an inscription after</p>
<p>this fashion:</p>

<p>There was a combination of piscatorial pride and mercantile</p>
<p>enterprise in this quaint device, that took our fancy.  It</p>
<p>suggested also a curious question of psychology in regard to the</p>
<p>inhibitory influence of horses and fish upon the human nerve of</p>
<p>veracity.  We named the place &quot;Point Ananias.&quot;</p>
<p>And yet, in fact, it was a wild and lonely spot, and not even the</p>
<p>Hebrew inscription could spoil the sense of solitude that</p>
<p>surrounded us when the night came, and the storm howled across the</p>
<p>take, and the darkness encircled us with a wall that only seemed</p>
<p>the more dense and impenetrable as the firelight blazed and leaped</p>
<p>within the black ring.</p>
<p>&quot;How far away is the nearest house, Johnny?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know; fifty miles, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what would you do if the canoes were burned, or if a tree fell</p>
<p>and smashed them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;d say a Pater noster, and take bread and bacon enough for</p>
<p>four days, and an axe, and plenty of matches, and make a straight</p>
<p>line through the woods.  But it wouldn&#x27;t be a joke, M&#x27;sieu&#x27;, I can</p>
<p>tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>The river Peribonca, into which Lake Tchitagama flows without a</p>
<p>break, is the noblest of all the streams that empty into Lake St.</p>
<p>John.  It is said to be more than three hundred miles long, and at</p>
<p>the mouth of the lake it is perhaps a thousand feet wide, flowing</p>
<p>with a deep, still current through the forest.  The dead-water</p>
<p>lasted for several miles; then the river sloped into a rapid,</p>
<p>spread through a net of islands, and broke over a ledge in a</p>
<p>cataract.  Another quiet stretch was followed by another fall, and</p>
<p>so on, along the whole course of the river.</p>
<p>We passed three of these falls in the first day&#x27;s voyage (by</p>
<p>portages so steep and rough that an Adirondack guide would have</p>
<p>turned gray at the sight of them), and camped at night just below</p>
<p>the Chute du Diable, where we found some ouananiche in the foam.</p>
<p>Our tents were on an islet, and all around we saw the primeval,</p>
<p>savage beauty of a world unmarred by man,</p>
<p>The river leaped, shouting, down its double stairway of granite,</p>
<p>rejoicing like a strong man to run a race.  The after-glow in the</p>
<p>western sky deepened from saffron to violet among the tops of the</p>
<p>cedars, and over the cliffs rose the moonlight, paling the heavens</p>
<p>but glorifying the earth.  There was something large and generous</p>
<p>and untrammelled in the scene, recalling one of Walt Whitman&#x27;s</p>
<p>rhapsodies:--</p>
<p>&quot;Earth of departed sunsets!  Earth of the mountains misty-topped!</p>
<p>Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!</p>
<p>Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the river!&quot;</p>
<p>All the next day we went down with the current.  Regiments of black</p>
<p>spruce stood in endless files like grenadiers, each tree capped</p>
<p>with a thick tuft of matted cones and branches.  Tall white birches</p>
<p>leaned out over the stream, Narcissus-like, as if to see their own</p>
<p>beauty in the moving mirror.  There were touches of colour on the</p>
<p>banks, the ragged pink flowers of the Joe-Pye-weed (which always</p>
<p>reminds me of a happy, good-natured tramp), and the yellow ear-</p>
<p>drops of the jewel-weed, and the intense blue of the closed</p>
<p>gentian, that strange flower which, like a reticent heart, never</p>
<p>opens to the light.  Sometimes the river spread out like a lake,</p>
<p>between high bluffs of sand fully a mile apart; and again it</p>
<p>divided into many channels, winding cunningly down among the</p>
<p>islands as if it were resolved to slip around the next barrier of</p>
<p>rock without a fall.  There were eight of these huge natural dams</p>
<p>in the course of that day&#x27;s journey.  Sometimes we followed one of</p>
<p>the side canals, and made the portage at a distance from the main</p>
<p>cataract; and sometimes we ran with the central current to the very</p>
<p>brink of the chute, darting aside just in time to escape going</p>
<p>over.  At the foot of the last fall we made our camp on a curving</p>
<p>beach of sand, and spent the rest of the afternoon in fishing.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see how closely the guides could guess at the</p>
<p>weight of the fish by looking at them.  The ouananiche are much</p>
<p>longer in proportion to their weight than trout, and a novice</p>
<p>almost always overestimates them.  But the guides were not</p>
<p>deceived.  &quot;This one will weigh four pounds and three-quarters, and</p>
<p>this one four pounds, but that one not more than three pounds; he</p>
<p>is meagre, M&#x27;sieu&#x27;, BUT he is meagre.&quot;  When we went ashore and</p>
<p>tried the spring balance (which every angler ought to carry with</p>
<p>him, as an aid to his conscience), the guides guess usually proved</p>
<p>to be within an ounce or two of the fact.  Any one of the senses</p>
<p>can be educated to do the work of the others.  The eyes of these</p>
<p>experienced fishermen were as sensitive to weight as if they had</p>
<p>been made to use as scales.</p>
<p>Below the last fall the Peribonca flows for a score of miles with</p>
<p>an unbroken, ever-widening stream, through low shores of forest and</p>
<p>bush and meadow.  Near its mouth the Little Peribonca joins it, and</p>
<p>the immense flood, nearly two miles wide, pours into Lake St. John.</p>
<p>Here we saw the first outpost of civilisation--a huge unpainted</p>
<p>storehouse, where supplies are kept for the lumbermen and the new</p>
<p>settlers.  Here also we found the tiny, lame steam launch that was</p>
<p>to carry us back to the Hotel Roberval.  Our canoes were stowed</p>
<p>upon the roof of the cabin, and we embarked for the last stage of</p>
<p>our long journey.</p>
<p>As we came out of the river-mouth, the opposite shore of the lake</p>
<p>was invisible, and a stiff &quot;Nor&#x27;wester&quot; was rolling big waves</p>
<p>across the bar.  It was like putting out into the open sea.  The</p>
<p>launch laboured and puffed along for four or five miles, growing</p>
<p>more and more asthmatic with every breath.  Then there was an</p>
<p>explosion in the engine-room.  Some necessary part of the</p>
<p>intestinal machinery had blown out.  There was a moment of</p>
<p>confusion.  The captain hurried to drop the anchor, and the narrow</p>
<p>craft lay rolling in the billows.</p>
<p>What to do?  The captain shrugged his shoulders like a Frenchman.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait here, I suppose.&quot;  But how long?  &quot;Who knows?  Perhaps till</p>
<p>to-morrow; perhaps the day after.  They will send another boat to</p>
<p>look for us in the course of time.&quot;</p>
<p>But the quarters were cramped; the weather looked ugly; if the wind</p>
<p>should rise, the cranky launch would not be a safe cradle for the</p>
<p>night.  Damon and I preferred the canoes, for they at least would</p>
<p>float if they were capsized.  So we stepped into the frail, buoyant</p>
<p>shells of bark once more, and danced over the big waves toward the</p>
<p>shore.  We made a camp on a wind-swept point of sand, and felt like</p>
<p>shipwrecked mariners.  But it was a gilt-edged shipwreck.  For our</p>
<p>larder was still full, and as if to provide us with the luxuries as</p>
<p>well as the necessities of life, Nature had spread an inexhaustible</p>
<p>dessert of the largest and most luscious blueberries around our</p>
<p>tents.</p>
<p>After supper, strolling along the beach, we debated the best way of</p>
<p>escape; whether to send one of our canoes around the eastern shore</p>
<p>of the lake that night, to meet the steamer at the Island House and</p>
<p>bring it to our rescue; or to set out the next morning, and paddle</p>
<p>both canoes around the western end of the lake, thirty miles, to</p>
<p>the Hotel Roberval.  While we were talking, we came to a dry old</p>
<p>birch-tree, with ragged, curling bark.  &quot;Here is a torch,&quot; cried</p>
<p>Damon, &quot;to throw light upon the situation.&quot;  He touched a match to</p>
<p>it, and the flames flashed up the tall trunk until it was</p>
<p>transformed into a pillar of fire.  But the sudden illumination</p>
<p>burned out, and our counsels were wrapt again in darkness and</p>
<p>uncertainty, when there came a great uproar of steam-whistles from</p>
<p>the lake.  They must be signalling for us.  What could it mean?</p>
<p>We fired our guns, leaped into a canoe, leaving two of the guides</p>
<p>to break camp, and paddled out swiftly into the night.  It seemed</p>
<p>an endless distance before we found the feeble light where the</p>
<p>crippled launch was tossing at anchor.  The captain shouted</p>
<p>something about a larger steamboat and a raft of logs, out in the</p>
<p>lake, a mile or two beyond.  Presently we saw the lights, and the</p>
<p>orange glow of the cabin windows.  Was she coming, or going, or</p>
<p>standing still?  We paddled on as fast as we could, shouting and</p>
<p>firing off a revolver until we had no more cartridges.  We were</p>
<p>resolved not to let that mysterious vessel escape us, and threw</p>
<p>ourselves with energy into the novel excitement of chasing a</p>
<p>steamboat in the dark.</p>
<p>Then the lights began to swing around; the throbbing of paddle-</p>
<p>wheels grew louder and louder; she was evidently coming straight</p>
<p>toward us.  At that moment it flashed upon us that, while she had</p>
<p>plenty of lights, we had none!  We were lying, invisible, right</p>
<p>across her track.  The character of the steamboat chase was</p>
<p>reversed.  We turned and fled, as the guides say, a quatre pattes,</p>
<p>into illimitable space, trying to get out of the way of our too</p>
<p>powerful friend.  It makes considerable difference, in the voyage</p>
<p>of life, whether you chase the steamboat, or the steamboat chases</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>Meantime our other canoe had approached unseen.  The steamer passed</p>
<p>safely between the two boats, slackening speed as the pilot caught</p>
<p>our loud halloo!  She loomed up above us like a man-of-war, and as</p>
<p>we climbed the ladder to the main-deck we felt that we had indeed</p>
<p>gotten out of the wilderness.  My old friend, Captain Savard, made</p>
<p>us welcome.  He had been sent out, much to his disgust, to catch a</p>
<p>runaway boom of logs and tow it back to Roberval; it would be an</p>
<p>all night affair; but we must take possession of his stateroom and</p>
<p>make ourselves comfortable; he would certainly bring us to the</p>
<p>hotel in time for breakfast.  So he went off on the upper deck, and</p>
<p>we heard him stamping about and yelling to his crew as they</p>
<p>struggled to get their unwieldy drove of six thousand logs in</p>
<p>motion.</p>
<p>All night long we assisted at the lumbermen&#x27;s difficult enterprise.</p>
<p>We heard the steamer snorting and straining at her clumsy, stubborn</p>
<p>convoy.  The hoarse shouts of the crew, disguised in a mongrel</p>
<p>dialect which made them (perhaps fortunately) less intelligible and</p>
<p>more forcible, mingled with our broken dreams.</p>
<p>But it was, in fact, a fitting close of our voyage.  For what were</p>
<p>we doing?  It was the last stage of the woodman&#x27;s labour.  It was</p>
<p>the gathering of a wild herd of the houses and churches and ships</p>
<p>and bridges that grow in the forests, and bringing them into the</p>
<p>fold of human service.  I wonder how often the inhabitant of the</p>
<p>snug Queen Anne cottage in the suburbs remembers the picturesque</p>
<p>toil and varied hardship that it has cost to hew and drag his walls</p>
<p>and floors and pretty peaked roofs out of the backwoods.  It might</p>
<p>enlarge his home, and make his musings by the winter fireside less</p>
<p>commonplace, to give a kindly thought now and then to the long</p>
<p>chain of human workers through whose hands the timber of his house</p>
<p>has passed, since it first felt the stroke of the axe in the snow-</p>
<p>bound winter woods, and floated, through the spring and summer, on</p>
<p>far-off lakes and little rivers, au large.</p>

<p>TROUT-FISHING IN THE TRAUN</p>
<p>&quot;Those who wish to forget painful thoughts do well to absent</p>
<p>themselves for a time from the ties and objects that recall them;</p>
<p>but we can be said only to fulfil our destiny in the place that</p>
<p>gave us birth.  I should on this account like well enough to spend</p>
<p>the whole of my life in travelling abroad if I could anywhere</p>
<p>borrow another life to spend afterwards at home.&quot;--WILLIAM HAZLITT:</p>
<p>On Going a Journey.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of trout-fishing in the Traun is that one catches</p>
<p>principally grayling.  But in this it resembles some other pursuits</p>
<p>which are not without their charm for minds open to the pleasures</p>
<p>of the unexpected--for example, reading George Borrow&#x27;s The Bible</p>
<p>in Spain with a view to theological information, or going to the</p>
<p>opening night at the Academy of Design with the intention of</p>
<p>looking at pictures.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are really trout in the Traun, rari nantes in</p>
<p>gurgite; and in some places more than in others; and all of high</p>
<p>spirit, though few of great size.  Thus the angler has his</p>
<p>favourite problem: Given an unknown stream and two kinds of fish,</p>
<p>the one better than the other; to find the better kind, and</p>
<p>determine the hour at which they will rise.  This is sport.</p>
<p>As for the little river itself, it has so many beauties that one</p>
<p>does not think of asking whether it has any faults.  Constant</p>
<p>fulness, and crystal clearness, and refreshing coolness of living</p>
<p>water, pale green like the jewel that is called aqua marina,</p>
<p>flowing over beds of clean sand and bars of polished gravel, and</p>
<p>dropping in momentary foam from rocky ledges, between banks that</p>
<p>are shaded by groves of fir and ash and poplar, or through dense</p>
<p>thickets of alder and willow, or across meadows of smooth verdure</p>
<p>sloping up to quaint old-world villages--all these are features of</p>
<p>the ideal little river.</p>
<p>I have spoken of these personal qualities first, because a truly</p>
<p>moral writer ought to make more of character than of position.  A</p>
<p>good river in a bad country would be more worthy of affection than</p>
<p>a bad river in a good country.  But the Traun has also the</p>
<p>advantages of an excellent worldly position.  For it rises all over</p>
<p>the Salzkammergut, the summer hunting-ground of the Austrian</p>
<p>Emperor, and flows through that most picturesque corner of his</p>
<p>domain from end to end.  Under the desolate cliffs of the</p>
<p>Todtengebirge on the east, and below the shining ice-fields of the</p>
<p>Dachstein on the south, and from the green alps around St. Wolfgang</p>
<p>on the west, the translucent waters are gathered in little tarns,</p>
<p>and shot through roaring brooks, and spread into lakes of wondrous</p>
<p>beauty, and poured through growing streams, until at last they are</p>
<p>all united just below the summer villa of his Kaiserly and Kingly</p>
<p>Majesty, Francis Joseph, and flow away northward, through the rest</p>
<p>of his game-preserve, into the Traunsee.  It is an imperial</p>
<p>playground, and such as I would consent to hunt the chamois in, if</p>
<p>an inscrutable Providence had made me a kingly kaiser, or even a</p>
<p>plain king or an unvarnished kaiser.  But, failing this, I was</p>
<p>perfectly content to spend a few idle days in fishing for trout and</p>
<p>catching grayling, at such times and places as the law of the</p>
<p>Austrian Empire allowed.</p>
<p>For it must be remembered that every stream in these over-civilised</p>
<p>European countries belongs to somebody, by purchase or rent.  And</p>
<p>all the fish in the stream are supposed to belong to the person who</p>
<p>owns or rents it.  They do not know their master&#x27;s voice, neither</p>
<p>will they follow when he calls.  But they are theoretically his.</p>
<p>To this legal fiction the untutored American must conform.  He must</p>
<p>learn to clothe his natural desires in the raiment of lawful</p>
<p>sanction, and take out some kind of a license before he follows his</p>
<p>impulse to fish.</p>
<p>It was in the town of Aussee, at the junction of the two highest</p>
<p>branches of the Traun, that this impulse came upon me, mildly</p>
<p>irresistible.  The full bloom of mid-July gayety in that ancient</p>
<p>watering-place was dampened, but not extinguished, by two days of</p>
<p>persistent and surprising showers.  I had exhausted the</p>
<p>possibilities of interest in the old Gothic church, and felt all</p>
<p>that a man should feel in deciphering the mural tombstones of the</p>
<p>families who were exiled for their faith in the days of the</p>
<p>Reformation.  The throngs of merry Hebrews from Vienna and Buda-</p>
<p>Pesth, amazingly arrayed as mountaineers and milk-maids, walking up</p>
<p>and down the narrow streets under umbrellas, had Cleopatra&#x27;s charm</p>
<p>of an infinite variety; but custom staled it.  The woodland paths,</p>
<p>winding everywhere through the plantations of fir-trees and</p>
<p>provided with appropriate names on wooden labels, and benches for</p>
<p>rest and conversation at discreet intervals, were too moist for</p>
<p>even the nymphs to take delight in them.  The only creatures that</p>
<p>suffered nothing by the rain were the two swift, limpid Trauns,</p>
<p>racing through the woods, like eager and unabashed lovers, to meet</p>
<p>in the middle of the village.  They were as clear, as joyous, as</p>
<p>musical as if the sun were shining.  The very sight of their</p>
<p>opalescent rapids and eddying pools was an invitation to that</p>
<p>gentle sport which is said to have the merit of growing better as</p>
<p>the weather grows worse.</p>
<p>I laid this fact before the landlord of the hotel of the Erzherzog</p>
<p>Johann, as poetically as I could, but he assured me that it was of</p>
<p>no consequence without an invitation from the gentleman to whom the</p>
<p>streams belonged; and he had gone away for a week.  The landlord</p>
<p>was such a good-natured person, and such an excellent sleeper, that</p>
<p>it was impossible to believe that he could have even the smallest</p>
<p>inaccuracy upon his conscience.  So I bade him farewell, and took</p>
<p>my way, four miles through the woods, to the lake from which one of</p>
<p>the streams flowed.</p>
<p>It was called the Grundlsee.  As I do not know the origin of the</p>
<p>name, I cannot consistently make any moral or historical</p>
<p>reflections upon it.  But if it has never become famous, it ought</p>
<p>to be, for the sake of a cozy and busy little Inn, perched on a</p>
<p>green hill beside the lake and overlooking the whole length of it,</p>
<p>from the groups of toy villas at the foot to the heaps of real</p>
<p>mountains at the head.  This Inn kept a thin but happy landlord,</p>
<p>who provided me with a blue license to angle, for the</p>
<p>inconsiderable sum of fifteen cents a day.  This conferred the</p>
<p>right of fishing not only in the Grundlsee, but also in the smaller</p>
<p>tarn of Toplitz, a mile above it, and in the swift stream which</p>
<p>unites them.  It all coincided with my desire as if by magic.  A</p>
<p>row of a couple of miles to the head of the lake, and a walk</p>
<p>through the forest, brought me to the smaller pond; and as the</p>
<p>afternoon sun was ploughing pale furrows through the showers, I</p>
<p>waded out on a point of reeds and cast the artful fly in the shadow</p>
<p>of the great cliffs of the Dead Mountains.</p>
<p>It was a fit scene for a lone fisherman.  But four sociable</p>
<p>tourists promptly appeared to act as spectators and critics.  Fly-</p>
<p>fishing usually strikes the German mind as an eccentricity which</p>
<p>calls for remonstrance.  After one of the tourists had suggestively</p>
<p>narrated the tale of seven trout which he had caught in another</p>
<p>lake, WITH WORMS, on the previous Sunday, they went away for a row,</p>
<p>(with salutations in which politeness but thinly veiled their</p>
<p>pity,) and left me still whipping the water in vain.  Nor was the</p>
<p>fortune of the day much better in the stream below.  It was a long</p>
<p>and wet wade for three fish too small to keep.  I came out on the</p>
<p>shore of the lake, where I had left the row-boat, with empty bag</p>
<p>and a feeling of damp discouragement.</p>
<p>There was still an hour or so of daylight, and a beautiful place to</p>
<p>fish where the stream poured swirling out into the lake.  A rise,</p>
<p>and a large one, though rather slow, awakened my hopes.  Another</p>
<p>rise, evidently made by a heavy fish, made me certain that virtue</p>
<p>was about to be rewarded.  The third time the hook went home.  I</p>
<p>felt the solid weight of the fish against the spring of the rod,</p>
<p>and that curious thrill which runs up the line and down the arm,</p>
<p>changing, somehow or other, into a pleasurable sensation of</p>
<p>excitement as it reaches the brain.  But it was only for a moment;</p>
<p>and then came that foolish, feeble shaking of the line from side to</p>
<p>side which tells the angler that he has hooked a great, big,</p>
<p>leather-mouthed chub--a fish which Izaak Walton says &quot;the French</p>
<p>esteem so mean as to call him Un Vilain.&quot;  Was it for this that I</p>
<p>had come to the country of Francis Joseph?</p>
<p>I took off the flies and put on one of those phantom minnows which</p>
<p>have immortalised the name of a certain Mr. Brown.  The minnow</p>
<p>swung on a long line as the boat passed back and forth across the</p>
<p>current, once, twice, three times-- and on the fourth circle there</p>
<p>was a sharp strike.  The rod bent almost double, and the reel sang</p>
<p>shrilly to the first rush of the fish.  He ran; he doubled; he went</p>
<p>to the bottom and sulked; he tried to go under the boat; he did all</p>
<p>that a game fish can do, except leaping.  After twenty minutes he</p>
<p>was tired enough to be lifted gently into the boat by a hand</p>
<p>slipped around his gills, and there he was, a lachsforelle of three</p>
<p>pounds&#x27; weight: small pointed head; silver sides mottled with dark</p>
<p>spots; square, powerful tail and large fins--a fish not unlike the</p>
<p>land-locked salmon of the Saguenay, but more delicate.</p>
<p>Half an hour later he was lying on the grass in front of the Inn.</p>
<p>The waiters paused, with their hands full of dishes, to look at</p>
<p>him; and the landlord called his guests, including my didactic</p>
<p>tourists, to observe the superiority of the trout of the Grundlsee.</p>
<p>The maids also came to look; and the buxom cook, with her spotless</p>
<p>apron and bare arms akimbo, was drawn from her kitchen, and pledged</p>
<p>her culinary honour that such a pracht-kerl should be served up in</p>
<p>her very best style.  The angler who is insensible to this sort of</p>
<p>indirect flattery through his fish does not exist.  Even the most</p>
<p>indifferent of men thinks more favourably of people who know a good</p>
<p>trout when they see it, and sits down to his supper with kindly</p>
<p>feelings.  Possibly he reflects, also, upon the incident as a hint</p>
<p>of the usual size of the fish in that neighbourhood.  He remembers</p>
<p>that he may have been favoured in this case beyond his deserts by</p>
<p>good-fortune, and resolving not to put too heavy a strain upon it,</p>
<p>considers the next place where it would be well for him to angle.</p>
<p>Hallstatt is about ten miles below Aussee.  The Traun here expands</p>
<p>into a lake, very dark and deep, shut in by steep and lofty</p>
<p>mountains.  The railway runs along the eastern shore.  On the other</p>
<p>side, a mile away, you see the old town, its white houses clinging</p>
<p>to the cliff like lichens to the face of a rock.  The guide-book</p>
<p>calls it &quot;a highly original situation.&quot;  But this is one of the</p>
<p>cases where a little less originality and a little more</p>
<p>reasonableness might be desired, at least by the permanent</p>
<p>inhabitants.  A ledge under the shadow of a precipice makes a</p>
<p>trying winter residence.  The people of Hallstatt are not a</p>
<p>blooming race: one sees many dwarfs and cripples among them.  But</p>
<p>to the summer traveller the place seems wonderfully picturesque.</p>
<p>Most of the streets are flights of steps.  The high-road has barely</p>
<p>room to edge itself through among the old houses, between the</p>
<p>window-gardens of bright flowers.  On the hottest July day the</p>
<p>afternoon is cool and shady.  The gay, little skiffs and long, open</p>
<p>gondolas are flitting continually along the lake, which is the main</p>
<p>street of Hallstatt.</p>
<p>The incongruous, but comfortable, modern hotel has a huge glass</p>
<p>veranda, where you can eat your dinner and observe human nature in</p>
<p>its transparent holiday disguises.  I was much pleased and</p>
<p>entertained by a family, or confederacy, of people attired as</p>
<p>peasants--the men with feathered hats, green stockings, and bare</p>
<p>knees--the women with bright skirts, bodices, and silk</p>
<p>neckerchiefs--who were always in evidence, rowing gondolas with</p>
<p>clumsy oars, meeting the steamboat at the wharf several times a</p>
<p>day, and filling the miniature garden of the hotel with rustic</p>
<p>greetings and early Salzkammergut attitudes.  After much</p>
<p>conjecture, I learned that they were the family and friends of a</p>
<p>newspaper editor from Vienna.  They had the literary instinct for</p>
<p>local colour.</p>
<p>The fishing at Hallstatt is at Obertraun.  There is a level stretch</p>
<p>of land above the lake, where the river flows peaceably, and the</p>
<p>fish have leisure to feed and grow.  It is leased to a peasant, who</p>
<p>makes a business of supplying the hotels with fish.  He was quite</p>
<p>willing to give permission to an angler; and I engaged one of his</p>
<p>sons, a capital young fellow, whose natural capacities for good</p>
<p>fellowship were only hampered by a most extraordinary German</p>
<p>dialect, to row me across the lake, and carry the net and a small</p>
<p>green barrel full of water to keep the fish alive, according to the</p>
<p>custom of the country.  The first day we had only four trout large</p>
<p>enough to put into the barrel; the next day I think there were six;</p>
<p>the third day, I remember very well, there were ten.  They were</p>
<p>pretty creatures, weighing from half a pound to a pound each, and</p>
<p>coloured as daintily as bits of French silk, in silver gray with</p>
<p>faint pink spots.</p>
<p>There was plenty to do at Hallstatt in the mornings.  An hour&#x27;s</p>
<p>walk from the town there was a fine waterfall, three hundred feet</p>
<p>high.  On the side of the mountain above the lake was one of the</p>
<p>salt-mines for which the region is celebrated.  It has been worked</p>
<p>for ages by many successive races, from the Celt downward.  Perhaps</p>
<p>even the men of the Stone Age knew of it, and came hither for</p>
<p>seasoning to make the flesh of the cave-bear and the mammoth more</p>
<p>palatable.  Modern pilgrims are permitted to explore the long, wet,</p>
<p>glittering galleries with a guide, and slide down the smooth wooden</p>
<p>rollers which join the different levels of the mines.  This pastime</p>
<p>has the same fascination as sliding down the balusters; and it is</p>
<p>said that even queens and princesses have been delighted with it.</p>
<p>This is a touching proof of the fundamental simplicity and unity of</p>
<p>our human nature.</p>
<p>But by far the best excursion from Hallstatt was an all-day trip to</p>
<p>the Zwieselalp--a mountain which seems to have been especially</p>
<p>created as a point of view.  From the bare summit you look right</p>
<p>into the face of the huge, snowy Dachstein, with the wild lake of</p>
<p>Gosau gleaming at its foot; and far away on the other side your</p>
<p>vision ranges over a confusion of mountains, with all the white</p>
<p>peaks of the Tyrol stretched along the horizon.  Such a wide</p>
<p>outlook as this helps the fisherman to enjoy the narrow beauties of</p>
<p>his little rivers.  No sport is at its best without interruption</p>
<p>and contrast.  To appreciate wading, one ought to climb a little on</p>
<p>odd days.</p>
<p>Isehl is about ten or twelve miles below Hallstatt, in the valley</p>
<p>of the Traun.  It is the fashionable summer-resort of Austria.  I</p>
<p>found it in the high tide of amusement.  The shady esplanade along</p>
<p>the river was crowded with brave women and fair men, in gorgeous</p>
<p>raiment; the hotels were overflowing; and there were various kinds</p>
<p>of music and entertainments at all hours of day and night.  But all</p>
<p>this did not seem to affect the fishing.</p>
<p>The landlord of the Konigin Elizabeth, who is also the Burgomaster</p>
<p>and a gentleman of varied accomplishments and no leisure, kindly</p>
<p>furnished me with a fishing license in the shape of a large pink</p>
<p>card.  There were many rules printed upon it: &quot;All fishes under</p>
<p>nine inches must be gently restored to the water.  No instrument of</p>
<p>capture must be used except the angle in the hand.  The card of</p>
<p>legitimation must be produced and exhibited at the polite request</p>
<p>of any of the keepers of the river.&quot;  Thus duly authorised and</p>
<p>instructed, I sallied forth to seek my pastime according to the</p>
<p>law.</p>
<p>The easiest way, in theory, was to take the afternoon train up the</p>
<p>river to one of the villages, and fish down a mile or two in the</p>
<p>evening, returning by the eight o&#x27;clock train.  But in practice the</p>
<p>habits of the fish interfered seriously with the latter part of</p>
<p>this plan.</p>
<p>On my first day I had spent several hours in the vain effort to</p>
<p>catch something better than small grayling.  The best time for the</p>
<p>trout was just approaching, as the broad light faded from the</p>
<p>stream; already they were beginning to feed, when I looked up from</p>
<p>the edge of a pool and saw the train rattling down the valley below</p>
<p>me.  Under the circumstances the only thing to do was to go on</p>
<p>fishing.  It was an even pool with steep banks, and the water ran</p>
<p>through it very straight and swift, some four feet deep and thirty</p>
<p>yards across.  As the tail-fly reached the middle of the water, a</p>
<p>fine trout literally turned a somersault over it, but without</p>
<p>touching it.  At the next cast he was ready, taking it with a rush</p>
<p>that carried him into the air with the fly in his mouth.  He</p>
<p>weighed three-quarters of a pound.  The next one was equally eager</p>
<p>in rising and sharp in playing, and the third might have been his</p>
<p>twin sister or brother.  So, after casting for hours and taking</p>
<p>nothing in the most beautiful pools, I landed three trout from one</p>
<p>unlikely place in fifteen minutes.  That was because the trout&#x27;s</p>
<p>supper-time had arrived.  So had mine.  I walked over to the</p>
<p>rambling old inn at Goisern, sought the cook in the kitchen and</p>
<p>persuaded her, in spite of the lateness of the hour, to boil the</p>
<p>largest of the fish for my supper, after which I rode peacefully</p>
<p>back to Ischl by the eleven o&#x27;clock train.</p>
<p>For the future I resolved to give up the illusory idea of coming</p>
<p>home by rail, and ordered a little one-horse carriage to meet me at</p>
<p>some point on the high-road every evening at nine o&#x27;clock.  In this</p>
<p>way I managed to cover the whole stream, taking a lower part each</p>
<p>day, from the lake of Hallstatt down to Ischl.</p>
<p>There was one part of the river, near Laufen, where the current was</p>
<p>very strong and waterfally, broken by ledges of rock.  Below these</p>
<p>it rested in long, smooth reaches, much beloved by the grayling.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in getting two or three of them out of each</p>
<p>run.</p>
<p>The grayling has a quaint beauty.  His appearance is aesthetic,</p>
<p>like a fish in a pre-raphaelite picture.  His colour, in midsummer,</p>
<p>is a golden gray, darker on the back, and with a few black spots</p>
<p>just behind his gills, like patches put on to bring out the pallor</p>
<p>of his complexion.  He smells of wild thyme when he first comes out</p>
<p>of the water, wherefore St. Ambrose of Milan complimented him in</p>
<p>courtly fashion &quot;Quid specie tua gratius?  Quid odore fragrantius?</p>
<p>Quod mella fragrant, hoc tuo corpore spiras.&quot;  But the chief glory</p>
<p>of the grayling is the large iridescent fin on his back.  You see</p>
<p>it cutting the water as he swims near the surface; and when you</p>
<p>have him on the bank it arches over him like a rainbow.  His mouth</p>
<p>is under his chin, and he takes the fly gently, by suction.  He is,</p>
<p>in fact, and to speak plainly, something of a sucker; but then he</p>
<p>is a sucker idealised and refined, the flower of the family.</p>
<p>Charles Cotton, the ingenious young friend of Walton, was all wrong</p>
<p>in calling the grayling &quot;one of the deadest-hearted fishes in the</p>
<p>world.&quot;  He fights and leaps and whirls, and brings his big fin to</p>
<p>bear across the force of the current with a variety of tactics that</p>
<p>would put his more aristocratic fellow-citizen, the trout, to the</p>
<p>blush.  Twelve of these pretty fellows, with a brace of good trout</p>
<p>for the top, filled my big creel to the brim.  And yet, such is the</p>
<p>inborn hypocrisy of the human heart that I always pretended to</p>
<p>myself to be disappointed because there were not more trout, and</p>
<p>made light of the grayling as a thing of naught.</p>
<p>The pink fishing license did not seem to be of much use.  Its</p>
<p>exhibition was demanded only twice.  Once a river guardian, who was</p>
<p>walking down the stream with a Belgian Baron and encouraging him to</p>
<p>continue fishing, climbed out to me on the end of a long</p>
<p>embankment, and with proper apologies begged to be favoured with a</p>
<p>view of my document.  It turned out that his request was a favour</p>
<p>to me, for it discovered the fact that I had left my fly-book, with</p>
<p>the pink card in it, beside an old mill, a quarter of a mile up the</p>
<p>stream.</p>
<p>Another time I was sitting beside the road, trying to get out of a</p>
<p>very long, wet, awkward pair of wading-stockings, an occupation</p>
<p>which is unfavourable to tranquillity of mind, when a man came up</p>
<p>to me in the dusk and accosted me with an absence of politeness</p>
<p>which in German amounted to an insult.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been fishing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you want to know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you any right to fish?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What right have you to ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am a keeper of the river.  Where is your card?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is in my pocket.  But pardon my curiosity, where is YOUR card?&quot;</p>
<p>This question appeared to paralyse him.  He had probably never been</p>
<p>asked for his card before.  He went lumbering off in the darkness,</p>
<p>muttering &quot;My card?  Unheard of!  MY card!&quot;</p>
<p>The routine of angling at Ischl was varied by an excursion to the</p>
<p>Lake of St. Wolfgang and the Schafberg, an isolated mountain on</p>
<p>whose rocky horn an inn has been built.  It stands up almost like a</p>
<p>bird-house on a pole, and commands a superb prospect; northward,</p>
<p>across the rolling plain and the Bavarian forest; southward, over a</p>
<p>tumultuous land of peaks and precipices.  There are many lovely</p>
<p>lakes in sight; but the loveliest of all is that which takes its</p>
<p>name from the old saint who wandered hither from the country of the</p>
<p>&quot;furious Franks&quot; and built his peaceful hermitage on the</p>
<p>Falkenstein.  What good taste some of those old saints had!</p>
<p>There is a venerable church in the village, with pictures</p>
<p>attributed to Michael Wohlgemuth, and a chapel which is said to</p>
<p>mark the spot where St. Wolfgang, who had lost his axe far up the</p>
<p>mountain, found it, like Longfellow&#x27;s arrow, in an oak, and &quot;still</p>
<p>unbroke.&quot;  The tree is gone, so it was impossible to verify the</p>
<p>story.  But the saint&#x27;s well is there, in a pavilion, with a bronze</p>
<p>image over it, and a profitable inscription to the effect that the</p>
<p>poorer pilgrims, &quot;who have come unprovided with either money or</p>
<p>wine, should be jolly well contented to find the water so fine.&quot;</p>
<p>There is also a famous echo farther up the lake, which repeats six</p>
<p>syllables with accuracy.  It is a strange coincidence that there</p>
<p>are just six syllables in the name of &quot;der heilige Wolfgang.&quot;  But</p>
<p>when you translate it into English, the inspiration of the echo</p>
<p>seems to be less exact.  The sweetest thing about St. Wolfgang was</p>
<p>the abundance of purple cyclamens, clothing the mountain meadows,</p>
<p>and filling the air with delicate fragrance like the smell of</p>
<p>lilacs around a New England farmhouse in early June.</p>
<p>There was still one stretch of the river above Ischl left for the</p>
<p>last evening&#x27;s sport.  I remember it so well: the long, deep place</p>
<p>where the water ran beside an embankment of stone, and the big</p>
<p>grayling poised on the edge of the shadow, rising and falling on</p>
<p>the current as a kite rises and falls on the wind and balances back</p>
<p>to the same position; the murmur of the stream and the hissing of</p>
<p>the pebbles underfoot in the rapids as the swift water rolled them</p>
<p>over and over; the odour of the fir-trees, and the streaks of warm</p>
<p>air in quiet places, and the faint whiffs of wood-smoke wafted from</p>
<p>the houses, and the brown flies dancing heavily up and down in the</p>
<p>twilight; the last good pool, where the river was divided, the main</p>
<p>part making a deep, narrow curve to the right, and the lesser part</p>
<p>bubbling into it over a bed of stones with half-a-dozen tiny</p>
<p>waterfalls, with a fine trout lying at the foot of each of them and</p>
<p>rising merrily as the white fly passed over him--surely it was all</p>
<p>very good, and a memory to be grateful for.  And when the basket</p>
<p>was full, it was pleasant to put off the heavy wading-shoes and the</p>
<p>long rubber-stockings, and ride homeward in an open carriage</p>
<p>through the fresh night air.  That is as near to sybaritic luxury</p>
<p>as a man should care to come.</p>
<p>The lights in the cottages are twinkling like fire-flies, and there</p>
<p>are small groups of people singing and laughing down the road.  The</p>
<p>honest fisherman reflects that this world is only a place of</p>
<p>pilgrimage, but after all there is a good deal of cheer on the</p>
<p>journey, if it is made with a contented heart.  He wonders who the</p>
<p>dwellers in the scattered houses may be, and weaves romances out of</p>
<p>the shadows on the curtained windows.  The lamps burning in the</p>
<p>wayside shrines tell him stories of human love and patience and</p>
<p>hope, and of divine forgiveness.  Dream-pictures of life float</p>
<p>before him, tender and luminous, filled with a vague, soft</p>
<p>atmosphere in which the simplest outlines gain a strange</p>
<p>significance.  They are like some of Millet&#x27;s paintings--&quot;The</p>
<p>Sower,&quot; or &quot;The Sheepfold,&quot;--there is very little detail in them</p>
<p>but sometimes a little means so much.</p>
<p>Then the moon slips up into the sky from behind the hills, and the</p>
<p>fisherman begins to think of home, and of the foolish, fond old</p>
<p>rhymes about those whom the moon sees far away, and the stars that</p>
<p>have the power to fulfil wishes--as if the celestial bodies knew or</p>
<p>cared anything about our small nerve-thrills which we call</p>
<p>affection and desires!  But if there were Some One above the moon</p>
<p>and stars who did know and care, Some One who could see the places</p>
<p>and the people that you and I would give so much to see, Some One</p>
<p>who could do for them all of kindness that you and I fain would do,</p>
<p>Some One able to keep our beloved in perfect peace and watch over</p>
<p>the little children sleeping in their beds beyond the sea--what</p>
<p>then?  Why, then, in the evening hour, one might have thoughts of</p>
<p>home that would go across the ocean by way of heaven, and be better</p>
<p>than dreams, almost as good as prayers.</p>
<p>AT THE SIGN OF THE BALSAM BOUGH</p>
<p>&quot;Come live with me, and be my love,</p>
<p>And we will all the pleasures prove</p>
<p>That valleys, groves, or hills, or field,</p>
<p>Or woods and steepy mountains yield.</p>
<p>&quot;There we will rest our sleepy heads,</p>
<p>And happy hearts, on balsam beds;</p>
<p>And every day go forth to fish</p>
<p>In foamy streams for ouananiche.&quot;</p>

<p>It has been asserted, on high philosophical authority, that woman</p>
<p>is a problem.  She is more; she is a cause of problems to others.</p>

<p>of whom I am so fortunate as to be one, are summoned by that</p>
<p>portion of our united mind which has at once the right of putting</p>
<p>the question and of casting the deciding vote, to answer this</p>
<p>conundrum: How can we go abroad without crossing the ocean, and</p>
<p>abandon an interesting family of children without getting</p>
<p>completely beyond their reach, and escape from the frying-pan of</p>
<p>housekeeping without falling into the fire of the summer hotel?</p>
<p>This apparently insoluble problem we usually solve by going to camp</p>
<p>in Canada.</p>
<p>It is indeed a foreign air that breathes around us as we make the</p>
<p>harmless, friendly voyage from Point Levis to Quebec.  The boy on</p>
<p>the ferry-boat, who cajoles us into buying a copy of Le Moniteur</p>
<p>containing last month&#x27;s news, has the address of a true though</p>
<p>diminutive Frenchman.  The landlord of the quiet little inn on the</p>
<p>outskirts of the town welcomes us with Gallic effusion as well-</p>
<p>known guests, and rubs his hands genially before us, while he</p>
<p>escorts us to our apartments, groping secretly in his memory to</p>
<p>recall our names.  When we walk down the steep, quaint streets to</p>
<p>revel in the purchase of moccasins and water-proof coats and</p>
<p>camping supplies, we read on a wall the familiar but transformed</p>
<p>legend, L&#x27;enfant pleurs, il veut son Camphoria, and remember with</p>
<p>joy that no infant who weeps in French can impose any</p>
<p>responsibility upon us in these days of our renewed honeymoon.</p>
<p>But the true delight of the expedition begins when the tents have</p>
<p>been set up, in the forest back of Lake St. John, and the green</p>
<p>branches have been broken for the woodland bed, and the fire has</p>
<p>been lit under the open sky, and, the livery of fashion being all</p>
<p>discarded, I sit down at a log table to eat supper with my lady</p>
<p>Greygown.  Then life seems simple and amiable and well worth</p>
<p>living.  Then the uproar and confusion of the world die away from</p>
<p>us, and we hear only the steady murmur of the river and the low</p>
<p>voice of the wind in the tree-tops.  Then time is long, and the</p>
<p>only art that is needful for its enjoyment is short and easy.  Then</p>
<p>we taste true comfort, while we lodge with Mother Green at the Sign</p>
<p>of the Balsam Bough.</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>UNDER THE WHITE BIRCHES.</p>
<p>Men may say what they will in praise of their houses, and grow</p>
<p>eloquent upon the merits of various styles of architecture, but,</p>
<p>for our part, we are agreed that there is nothing to be compared</p>
<p>with a tent.  It is the most venerable and aristocratic form of</p>
<p>human habitation.  Abraham and Sarah lived in it, and shared its</p>
<p>hospitality with angels.  It is exempt from the base tyranny of the</p>
<p>plumber, the paper-hanger, and the gas-man.  It is not immovably</p>
<p>bound to one dull spot of earth by the chains of a cellar and a</p>
<p>system of water-pipes.  It has a noble freedom of locomotion.  It</p>
<p>follows the wishes of its inhabitants, and goes with them, a</p>
<p>travelling home, as the spirit moves them to explore the</p>
<p>wilderness.  At their pleasure, new beds of wild flowers surround</p>
<p>it, new plantations of trees overshadow it, and new avenues of</p>
<p>shining water lead to its ever-open door.  What the tent lacks in</p>
<p>luxury it makes up in liberty: or rather let us say that liberty</p>
<p>itself is the greatest luxury.</p>
<p>Another thing is worth remembering--a family which lives in a tent</p>
<p>never can have a skeleton in the closet.</p>
<p>But it must not be supposed that every spot in the woods is</p>
<p>suitable for a camp, or that a good tenting-ground can be chosen</p>
<p>without knowledge and forethought.  One of the requisites, indeed,</p>
<p>is to be found everywhere in the St. John region; for all the lakes</p>
<p>and rivers are full of clear, cool water, and the traveller does</p>
<p>not need to search for a spring.  But it is always necessary to</p>
<p>look carefully for a bit of smooth ground on the shore, far enough</p>
<p>above the water to be dry, and slightly sloping, so that the head</p>
<p>of the bed may be higher than the foot.  Above all, it must be free</p>
<p>from big stones and serpentine roots of trees.  A root that looks</p>
<p>no bigger that an inch-worm in the daytime assumes the proportions</p>
<p>of a boa-constrictor at midnight--when you find it under your hip-</p>
<p>bone.  There should also be plenty of evergreens near at hand for</p>
<p>the beds.  Spruce will answer at a pinch; it has an aromatic smell;</p>
<p>but it is too stiff and humpy.  Hemlock is smoother and more</p>
<p>flexible; but the spring soon wears out of it.  The balsam-fir,</p>
<p>with its elastic branches and thick flat needles, is the best of</p>
<p>all.  A bed of these boughs a foot deep is softer than a mattress</p>
<p>and as fragrant as a thousand Christmas-trees.  Two things more are</p>
<p>needed for the ideal camp-ground--an open situation, where the</p>
<p>breeze will drive away the flies and mosquitoes, and an abundance</p>
<p>of dry firewood within easy reach.  Yes, and a third thing must not</p>
<p>be forgotten; for, says my lady Greygown:</p>
<p>&quot;I shouldn&#x27;t feel at home in camp unless I could sit in the door of</p>
<p>the tent and look out across flowing water.&quot;</p>
<p>All these conditions are met in our favourite camping place below</p>
<p>the first fall in the Grande Decharge.  A rocky point juts out into</p>
<p>the rivet and makes a fine landing for the canoes.  There is a</p>
<p>dismantled fishing-cabin a few rods back in the woods, from which</p>
<p>we can borrow boards for a table and chairs.  A group of cedars on</p>
<p>the lower edge of the point opens just wide enough to receive and</p>
<p>shelter our tent.  At a good distance beyond ours, the guides&#x27; tent</p>
<p>is pitched; and the big camp-fire burns between the two dwellings.</p>
<p>A pair of white-birches lift their leafy crowns far above us, and</p>
<p>after them we name the place Le Camp aux Bouleaux.</p>
<p>&quot;Why not call trees people?--since, if you come to live among them</p>
<p>year after year, you will learn to know many of them personally,</p>
<p>and an attachment will grow up between you and them individually.&quot;</p>
<p>So writes that Doctor Amabilis of woodcraft, W. C. Prime, in his</p>
<p>book, Among the Northern Hills, and straightway launches forth into</p>
<p>eulogy on the white-birch.  And truly it is an admirable, lovable,</p>
<p>and comfortable tree, beautiful to look upon and full of various</p>
<p>uses.  Its wood is strong to make paddles and axe handles, and</p>
<p>glorious to burn, blazing up at first with a flashing flame, and</p>
<p>then holding the fire in its glowing heart all through the night.</p>
<p>Its bark is the most serviceable of all the products of the</p>
<p>wilderness.  In Russia, they say, it is used in tanning, and gives</p>
<p>its subtle, sacerdotal fragrance to Russia leather.  But here, in</p>
<p>the woods, it serves more primitive ends.  It can be peeled off in</p>
<p>a huge roll from some giant tree and fashioned into a swift canoe</p>
<p>to carry man over the waters.  It can be cut into square sheets to</p>
<p>roof his shanty in the forest.  It is the paper on which he writes</p>
<p>his woodland despatches, and the flexible material which he bends</p>
<p>into drinking-cups of silver lined with gold.  A thin strip of it</p>
<p>wrapped around the end of a candle and fastened in a cleft stick</p>
<p>makes a practicable chandelier.  A basket for berries, a horn to</p>
<p>call the lovelorn moose through the autumnal woods, a canvas on</p>
<p>which to draw the outline of great and memorable fish--all these</p>
<p>and many other indispensable luxuries are stored up for the skilful</p>
<p>woodsman in the birch bark.</p>
<p>Only do not rob or mar the tree, unless you really need what it has</p>
<p>to give you.  Let it stand and grow in virgin majesty, ungirdled</p>
<p>and unscarred, while the trunk becomes a firm pillar of the forest</p>
<p>temple, and the branches spread abroad a refuge of bright green</p>
<p>leaves for the birds of the air.  Nature never made a more</p>
<p>excellent piece of handiwork.  &quot;And if,&quot; said my lady Greygown, &quot;I</p>
<p>should ever become a dryad, I would choose to be transformed into a</p>
<p>white-birch.  And then, when the days of my life were numbered, and</p>
<p>the sap had ceased to flow, and the last leaf had fallen, and the</p>
<p>dry bark hung around me in ragged curls and streamers, some</p>
<p>wandering hunter would come in the wintry night and touch a lighted</p>
<p>coal to my body, and my spirit would flash up in a fiery chariot</p>
<p>into the sky.&quot;</p>
<p>The chief occupation of our idle days on the Grande Decharge was</p>
<p>fishing.  Above the camp spread a noble pool, more than two miles</p>
<p>in circumference, and diversified with smooth bays and whirling</p>
<p>eddies, sand beaches and rocky islands.  The river poured into it</p>
<p>at the head, foaming and raging down a long chute, and swept out of</p>
<p>it just in front of our camp in a merry, musical rapid.  It was</p>
<p>full of fish of various kinds--long-nosed pickerel, wall-eyed pike,</p>
<p>and stupid chub.  But the prince of the pool was the fighting</p>
<p>ouananiche, the little salmon of St. John.</p>
<p>Here let me chant thy praise, thou noblest and most high-minded</p>
<p>fish, the cleanest feeder, the merriest liver, the loftiest leaper,</p>
<p>and the bravest warrior of all creatures that swim!  Thy cousin,</p>
<p>the trout, in his purple and gold with crimson spots, wears a more</p>
<p>splendid armour than thy russet and silver mottled with black, but</p>
<p>thine is the kinglier nature.  His courage and skill compared with</p>
<p>thine</p>

<p>The old salmon of the sea who begot thee, long ago, in these inland</p>
<p>waters, became a backslider, descending again to the ocean, and</p>
<p>grew gross and heavy with coarse feeding.  But thou, unsalted</p>
<p>salmon of the foaming floods, not landlocked, as men call thee, but</p>
<p>choosing of thine own free-will to dwell on a loftier level, in the</p>
<p>pure, swift current of a living stream, hast grown in grace and</p>
<p>risen to a higher life.  Thou art not to be measured by quantity,</p>
<p>but by quality, and thy five pounds of pure vigour will outweigh a</p>
<p>score of pounds of flesh less vitalised by spirit.  Thou feedest on</p>
<p>the flies of the air, and thy food is transformed into an aerial</p>
<p>passion for flight, as thou springest across the pool, vaulting</p>
<p>toward the sky.  Thine eyes have grown large and keen by peering</p>
<p>through the foam, and the feathered hook that can deceive thee must</p>
<p>be deftly tied and delicately cast.  Thy tail and fins, by</p>
<p>ceaseless conflict with the rapids, have broadened and</p>
<p>strengthened, so that they can flash thy slender body like a living</p>
<p>arrow up the fall.  As Lancelot among the knights, so art thou</p>
<p>among the fish, the plain-armoured hero, the sunburnt champion of</p>
<p>all the water-folk.</p>
<p>Every morning and evening, Greygown and I would go out for</p>
<p>ouananiche, and sometimes we caught plenty and sometimes few, but</p>
<p>we never came back without a good catch of happiness.  There were</p>
<p>certain places where the fish liked to stay.  For example, we</p>
<p>always looked for one at the lower corner of a big rock, very close</p>
<p>to it, where he could poise himself easily on the edge of the</p>
<p>strong downward stream.  Another likely place was a straight run of</p>
<p>water, swift, but not too swift, with a sunken stone in the middle.</p>
<p>The ouananiche does not like crooked, twisting water.  An even</p>
<p>current is far more comfortable, for then he discovers just how</p>
<p>much effort is needed to balance against it, and keeps up the</p>
<p>movement mechanically, as if he were half asleep.  But his</p>
<p>favourite place is under one of the floating islands of thick foam</p>
<p>that gather in the corners below the falls.  The matted flakes give</p>
<p>a grateful shelter from the sun, I fancy, and almost all game-fish</p>
<p>love to lie in the shade; but the chief reason why the onananiche</p>
<p>haunt the drifting white mass is because it is full of flies and</p>
<p>gnats, beaten down by the spray of the cataract, and sprinkled all</p>
<p>through the foam like plums in a cake.  To this natural confection</p>
<p>the little salmon, lurking in his corner, plays the part of Jack</p>
<p>Horner all day long, and never wearies.</p>
<p>&quot;See that belle brou down below there!&quot; said Ferdinand, as we</p>
<p>scrambled over the huge rocks at the foot of the falls; &quot;there</p>
<p>ought to be salmon there en masse.&quot;  Yes, there were the sharp</p>
<p>noses picking out the unfortunate insects, and the broad tails</p>
<p>waving lazily through the foam as the fish turned in the water.  At</p>
<p>this season of the year, when summer is nearly ended, and every</p>
<p>ouananiche in the Grande Decharge has tasted feathers and seen a</p>
<p>hook, it is useless to attempt to delude them with the large gaudy</p>
<p>flies which the fishing-tackle-maker recommends.  There are only</p>
<p>two successful methods of angling now.  The first of these I tried,</p>
<p>and by casting delicately with a tiny brown trout-fly tied on a</p>
<p>gossamer strand of gut, captured a pair of fish weighing about</p>
<p>three pounds each.  They fought against the spring of the four-</p>
<p>ounce rod for nearly half an hour before Ferdinand could slip the</p>
<p>net around them.  But there was another and a broader tail still</p>
<p>waving disdainfully on the outer edge of the foam.  &quot;And now,&quot; said</p>
<p>the gallant Ferdinand, &quot;the turn is to madame, that she should</p>
<p>prove her fortune--attend but a moment, madame, while I seek the</p>
<p>sauterelle.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the second method: the grasshopper was attached to the</p>
<p>hook, and casting the line well out across the pool, Ferdinand put</p>
<p>the rod into Greygown&#x27;s hands.  She stood poised upon a pinnacle of</p>
<p>rock, like patience on a monument, waiting for a bite.  It came.</p>
<p>There was a slow, gentle pull at the line, answered by a quick jerk</p>
<p>of the rod, and a noble fish flashed into the air.  Four pounds and</p>
<p>a half at least!  He leaped again and again, shaking the drops from</p>
<p>his silvery sides.  He rushed up the rapids as if he had determined</p>
<p>to return to the lake, and down again as if he had changed his</p>
<p>plans and determined to go to the Saguenay.  He sulked in the deep</p>
<p>water and rubbed his nose against the rocks.  He did his best to</p>
<p>treat that treacherous grasshopper as the whale served Jonah.  But</p>
<p>Greygown, through all her little screams and shouts of excitement,</p>
<p>was steady and sage.  She never gave the fish an inch of slack</p>
<p>line; and at last he lay glittering on the rocks, with the black</p>
<p>St. Andrew&#x27;s crosses clearly marked on his plump sides, and the</p>
<p>iridescent spots gleaming on his small, shapely head.  &quot;Une belle!&quot;</p>
<p>cried Ferdinand, as he held up the fish in triumph, &quot;and it is</p>
<p>madame who has the good fortune.  She understands well to take the</p>
<p>large fish--is it not?&quot;  Greygown stepped demurely down from her</p>
<p>pinnacle, and as we drifted down the pool in the canoe, under the</p>
<p>mellow evening sky, her conversation betrayed not a trace of the</p>
<p>pride that a victorious fisherman would have shown.  On the</p>
<p>contrary, she insisted that angling was an affair of chance--which</p>
<p>was consoling, though I knew it was not altogether true--and that</p>
<p>the smaller fish were just as pleasant to catch and better to eat,</p>
<p>after all.  For a generous rival, commend me to a woman.  And if I</p>
<p>must compete, let it be with one who has the grace to dissolve the</p>
<p>bitter of defeat in the honey of a mutual self-congratulation.</p>
<p>We had a garden, and our favourite path through it was the portage</p>
<p>leading around the falls.  We travelled it very frequently, making</p>
<p>an excuse of idle errands to the steamboat-landing on the lake, and</p>
<p>sauntering along the trail as if school were out and would never</p>
<p>keep again.  It was the season of fruits rather than of flowers.</p>
<p>Nature was reducing the decorations of her table to make room for</p>
<p>the banquet.  She offered us berries instead of blossoms.</p>
<p>There were the light coral clusters of the dwarf cornel set in</p>
<p>whorls of pointed leaves; and the deep blue bells of the Clintonia</p>
<p>borealis (which the White Mountain people call the bear-berry, and</p>
<p>I hope the name will stick, for it smacks of the woods, and it is a</p>
<p>shame to leave so free and wild a plant under the burden of a Latin</p>
<p>name); and the gray, crimson-veined berries for which the Canada</p>
<p>Mayflower had exchanged its feathery white bloom; and the ruby</p>
<p>drops of the twisted stalk hanging like jewels along its bending</p>
<p>stem.  On the three-leaved table which once carried the gay flower</p>
<p>of the wake-robin, there was a scarlet lump like a red pepper</p>
<p>escaped to the forest and run wild.  The partridge-vine was full of</p>
<p>rosy provision for the birds.  The dark tiny leaves of the creeping</p>
<p>snow-berry were all sprinkled over with delicate drops of spicy</p>
<p>foam.  There were few belated raspberries, and, if we chose to go</p>
<p>out into the burnt ground, we could find blueberries in plenty.</p>
<p>But there was still bloom enough to give that festal air without</p>
<p>which the most abundant feast seems coarse and vulgar.  The pale</p>
<p>gold of the loosestrife had faded, but the deeper yellow of the</p>
<p>goldenrod had begun to take its place.  The blue banners of the</p>
<p>fleur-de-lis had vanished from beside the springs, but the purple</p>
<p>of the asters was appearing.  Closed gentians kept their secret</p>
<p>inviolate, and bluebells trembled above the rocks.  The quaint</p>
<p>pinkish-white flowers of the turtle-head showed in wet places, and</p>
<p>instead of the lilac racemes of the purple-fringed orchis, which</p>
<p>had disappeared with midsummer, we found now the slender braided</p>
<p>spikes of the lady&#x27;s-tresses, latest and lowliest of the orchids,</p>
<p>pale and pure as nuns of the forest, and exhaling a celestial</p>
<p>fragrance.  There is a secret pleasure in finding these delicate</p>
<p>flowers in the rough heart of the wilderness.  It is like</p>
<p>discovering the veins of poetry in the character of a guide or a</p>
<p>lumberman.  And to be able to call the plants by name makes them a</p>
<p>hundredfold more sweet and intimate.  Naming things is one of the</p>
<p>oldest and simplest of human pastimes.  Children play at it with</p>
<p>their dolls and toy animals.  In fact, it was the first game ever</p>
<p>played on earth, for the Creator who planted the garden eastward in</p>
<p>Eden knew well what would please the childish heart of man, when He</p>
<p>brought all the new-made creatures to Adam, &quot;to see what he would</p>
<p>call them.&quot;</p>
<p>Our rustic bouquet graced the table under the white-birches, while</p>
<p>we sat by the fire and watched our four men at the work of the</p>
<p>camp--Joseph and Raoul chopping wood in the distance; Francois</p>
<p>slicing juicy rashers from the flitch of bacon; and Ferdinand, the</p>
<p>chef, heating the frying-pan in preparation for supper.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever thought,&quot; said Greygown, in a contented tone of</p>
<p>voice, &quot;that this is the only period of our existence when we</p>
<p>attain to the luxury of a French cook?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And one with the grand manner, too,&quot; I replied, &quot;for he never</p>
<p>fails to ask what it is that madame desires to eat to-day, as if</p>
<p>the larder of Lucullus were at his disposal, though he knows well</p>
<p>enough that the only choice lies between broiled fish and fried</p>
<p>fish, or bacon with eggs and a rice omelet.  But I like the fiction</p>
<p>of a lordly ordering of the repast.  How much better it is than</p>
<p>having to eat what is flung before you at a summer boarding-house</p>
<p>by a scornful waitress!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another thing that pleases me,&quot; continued my lady, &quot;is the</p>
<p>unbreakableness of the dishes.  There are no nicks in the edges of</p>
<p>the best plates here; and, oh! it is a happy thing to have a home</p>
<p>without bric-a-brac.  There is nothing here that needs to be</p>
<p>dusted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And no engagements for to-morrow,&quot; I ejaculated.  &quot;Dishes that</p>
<p>can&#x27;t be broken, and plans that can--that&#x27;s the ideal of</p>
<p>housekeeping.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then,&quot; added my philosopher in skirts, &quot;it is certainly</p>
<p>refreshing to get away from all one&#x27;s relations for a little</p>
<p>while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how do you make that out?&quot; I asked, in mild surprise.  &quot;What</p>
<p>are you going to do with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said she, with a fine air of independence, &quot;I don&#x27;t count</p>
<p>you.  You are not a relation, only a connection by marriage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; I answered, between the meditative puffs of my</p>
<p>pipe, &quot;it is good to consider the advantages of our present</p>
<p>situation.  We shall soon come into the frame of mind of the Sultan</p>
<p>of Morocco when he camped in the Vale of Rabat.  The place pleased</p>
<p>him so well that he staid until the very pegs of his tent took root</p>
<p>and grew up into a grove of trees around his pavilion.&quot;</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>KENOGAMI.</p>
<p>The guides were a little restless under the idle regime of our lazy</p>
<p>camp, and urged us to set out upon some adventure.  Ferdinand was</p>
<p>like the uncouth swain in Lycidas.  Sitting upon the bundles of</p>
<p>camp equipage on the shore, and crying,--</p>

<p>he led us forth to seek the famous fishing grounds on Lake</p>
<p>Kenogami.</p>
<p>We skirted the eastern end of Lake St. John in our two canoes, and</p>
<p>pushed up La Belle Riviere to Hebertville, where all the children</p>
<p>turned out to follow our procession through the village.  It was</p>
<p>like the train that tagged after the Pied Piper of Hamelin.  We</p>
<p>embarked again, surrounded by an admiring throng, at the bridge</p>
<p>where the main street crossed a little stream, and paddled up it,</p>
<p>through a score of back yards and a stretch of reedy meadows, where</p>
<p>the wild and tame ducks fed together, tempting the sportsman to</p>
<p>sins of ignorance.  We crossed the placid Lac Vert, and after a</p>
<p>carry of a mile along the high-road toward Chicoutimi, turned down</p>
<p>a steep hill and pitched our tents on a crescent of silver sand,</p>
<p>with the long, fair water of Kenogami before us.</p>
<p>It is amazing to see how quickly these woodsmen can make a camp.</p>
<p>Each one knew precisely his share of the enterprise.  One sprang to</p>
<p>chop a dry spruce log into fuel for a quick fire, and fell a harder</p>
<p>tree to keep us warm through the night.  Another stripped a pile of</p>
<p>boughs from a balsam for the beds.  Another cut the tent-poles from</p>
<p>a neighbouring thicket.  Another unrolled the bundles and made</p>
<p>ready the cooking utensils.  As if by magic, the miracle of the</p>
<p>camp was accomplished.--</p>

<p>Our permanent camp was another day&#x27;s voyage down the lake, on a</p>
<p>beach opposite the Point Ausable.  There the water was contracted</p>
<p>to a narrow strait, and in the swift current, close to the point,</p>
<p>the great trout had fixed their spawning-bed from time immemorial.</p>
<p>It was the first week in September, and the magnates of the lake</p>
<p>were already assembling--the Common Councilmen and the Mayor and</p>
<p>the whole Committee of Seventy.  There were giants in that place,</p>
<p>rolling lazily about, and chasing each other on the surface of the</p>
<p>water.  &quot;Look, M&#x27;sieu&#x27;!&quot; cried Francois, in excitement, as we lay</p>
<p>at anchor in the gray morning twilight; &quot;one like a horse has just</p>
<p>leaped behind us; I assure you, big like a horse!&quot;</p>
<p>But the fish were shy and dour.  Old Castonnier, the guardian of</p>
<p>the lake, lived in his hut on the shore, and flogged the water,</p>
<p>early and late, every day with his home-made flies.  He was</p>
<p>anchored in his dugout close beside us, and grinned with delight as</p>
<p>he saw his over-educated trout refuse my best casts.  &quot;They are</p>
<p>here, M&#x27;sieu&#x27;, for you can see them,&quot; he said, by way of</p>
<p>discouragement, &quot;but it is difficult to take them.  Do you not find</p>
<p>it so?&quot;</p>
<p>In the back of my fly-book I discovered a tiny phantom minnow--a</p>
<p>dainty affair of varnished silk, as light as a feather--and quietly</p>
<p>attached it to the leader in place of the tail-fly.  Then the fun</p>
<p>began.</p>
<p>One after another the big fish dashed at that deception, and we</p>
<p>played and netted them, until our score was thirteen, weighing</p>
<p>altogether thirty-five pounds, and the largest five pounds and a</p>
<p>half.  The guardian was mystified and disgusted.  He looked on for</p>
<p>a while in silence, and then pulled up anchor and clattered ashore.</p>
<p>He must have made some inquiries and reflections during the day,</p>
<p>for that night he paid a visit to our camp.  After telling bear</p>
<p>stories and fish stories for an hour or two by the fire, he rose to</p>
<p>depart, and tapping his forefinger solemnly upon my shoulder,</p>
<p>delivered himself as follows:--</p>
<p>&quot;You can say a proud thing when you go home, M&#x27;sieu&#x27;--that you have</p>
<p>beaten the old Castonnier.  There are not many fishermen who can</p>
<p>say that.  &quot;But,&quot; he added, with confidential emphasis, &quot;c&#x27;etait</p>
<p>votre sacre p&#x27;tit poisson qui a fait cela.&quot;</p>
<p>That was a touch of human nature, my rusty old guardian, more</p>
<p>welcome to me than all the morning&#x27;s catch.  Is there not always a</p>
<p>&quot;confounded little minnow&quot; responsible for our failures?  Did you</p>
<p>ever see a school-boy tumble on the ice without stooping</p>
<p>immediately to re-buckle the strap of his skates?  And would not</p>
<p>Ignotus have painted a masterpiece if he could have found good</p>
<p>brushes and a proper canvas?  Life&#x27;s shortcomings would be bitter</p>
<p>indeed if we could not find excuses for them outside of ourselves.</p>
<p>And as for life&#x27;s successes--well, it is certainly wholesome to</p>
<p>remember how many of them are due to a fortunate position and the</p>
<p>proper tools.</p>
<p>Our tent was on the border of a coppice of young trees.  It was</p>
<p>pleasant to be awakened by a convocation of birds at sunrise, and</p>
<p>to watch the shadows of the leaves dance out upon our translucent</p>
<p>roof of canvas.</p>
<p>All the birds in the bush are early, but there are so many of them</p>
<p>that it is difficult to believe that every one can be rewarded with</p>
<p>a worm.  Here in Canada those little people of the air who appear</p>
<p>as transient guests of spring and autumn in the Middle States, are</p>
<p>in their summer home and breeding-place.  Warblers, named for the</p>
<p>magnolia and the myrtle, chestnut-sided, bay-breasted, blue-backed,</p>
<p>and black-throated, flutter and creep along the branches with</p>
<p>simple lisping music.  Kinglets, ruby-crowned and golden-crowned,</p>
<p>tiny, brilliant sparks of life, twitter among the trees, breaking</p>
<p>occasionally into clearer, sweeter songs.  Companies of redpolls</p>
<p>and crossbills pass chirping through the thickets, busily seeking</p>
<p>their food.  The fearless, familiar chickadee repeats his name</p>
<p>merrily, while he leads his family to explore every nook and cranny</p>
<p>of the wood.  Cedar wax-wings, sociable wanderers, arrive in</p>
<p>numerous flocks.  The Canadians call them &quot;recollets,&quot; because they</p>
<p>wear a brown crest of the same colour as the hoods of the monks who</p>
<p>came with the first settlers to New France.  They are a songless</p>
<p>tribe, although their quick, reiterated call as they take to flight</p>
<p>has given them the name of chatterers.  The beautiful tree-sparrows</p>
<p>and the pine-siskins are more melodious, and the slate-coloured</p>
<p>juncos, flitting about the camp, are as garrulous as chippy-birds.</p>
<p>All these varied notes come and go through the tangle of morning</p>
<p>dreams.  And now the noisy blue-jay is calling &quot;Thief--thief--</p>
<p>thief!&quot; in the distance, and a pair of great pileated woodpeckers</p>
<p>with crimson crests are laughing loudly in the swamp over some</p>
<p>family joke.  But listen! what is that harsh creaking note?  It is</p>
<p>the cry of the Northern shrike, of whom tradition says that he</p>
<p>catches little birds and impales them on sharp thorns.  At the</p>
<p>sound of his voice the concert closes suddenly and the singers</p>
<p>vanish into thin air.  The hour of music is over; the commonplace</p>
<p>of day has begun.  And there is my lady Greygown, already up and</p>
<p>dressed, standing by the breakfast-table and laughing at my belated</p>
<p>appearance.</p>
<p>But the birds were not our only musicians at Kenogami.  French</p>
<p>Canada is one of the ancestral homes of song.  Here you can still</p>
<p>listen to those quaint ballads which were sung centuries ago in</p>
<p>Normandie and Provence.  &quot;A la Claire Fontaine,&quot; &quot;Dans Paris y a-t-</p>
<p>une Brune plus Belle que le Jour,&quot; &quot;Sur le Pont d&#x27;Avignon,&quot; &quot;En</p>
<p>Roulant ma Boule,&quot; &quot;La Poulette Grise,&quot; and a hundred other folk-</p>

<p>chanted in the farmhouse or the lumber shanty, to the tunes which</p>
<p>have come down from an unknown source, and never lost their echo in</p>
<p>the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>Our Ferdinand was a perfect fountain of music.  He had a clear</p>
<p>tenor voice, and solaced every task and shortened every voyage with</p>
<p>melody.  &quot;A song, Ferdinand, a jolly song,&quot; the other men would</p>
<p>say, as the canoes went sweeping down the quiet lake.  And then the</p>
<p>leader would strike up a well-known air, and his companions would</p>
<p>come in on the refrain, keeping time with the stroke of their</p>
<p>paddles.  Sometimes it would be a merry ditty:</p>

<p>But more frequently the song was touched with a plaintive pleasant</p>
<p>melancholy.  The minstrel told how he had gone into the woods and</p>
<p>heard the nightingale, and she had confided to him that lovers are</p>
<p>often unhappy.  The story of La Belle Francoise was repeated in</p>
<p>minor cadences--how her sweetheart sailed away to the wars, and</p>
<p>when he came back the village church bells were ringing, and he</p>
<p>said to himself that Francoise had been faithless, and the chimes</p>
<p>were for her marriage; but when he entered the church it was her</p>
<p>funeral that he saw, for she had died of love.  It is strange how</p>
<p>sorrow charms us when it is distant and visionary.  Even when we</p>
<p>are happiest we enjoy making music</p>

<p>&quot;What is that song which you are singing, Ferdinand?&quot; asks the</p>
<p>lady, as she hears him humming behind her in the canoe.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, madame, it is the chanson of a young man who demands of his</p>
<p>blonde why she will not marry him.  He says that he has waited long</p>
<p>time, and the flowers are falling from the rose-tree, and he is</p>
<p>very sad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And does she give a reason?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, madame--that is to say, a reason of a certain sort; she</p>
<p>declares that she is not quite ready; he must wait until the rose-</p>
<p>tree adorns itself again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is the end--do they get married at last?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I do not know, madame.  The chanson does not go so far.  It</p>
<p>ceases with the complaint of the young man.  And it is a very</p>
<p>uncertain affair--this affair of the heart--is it not?&quot;</p>
<p>Then, as if he turned from such perplexing mysteries to something</p>
<p>plain and sure and easy to understand, he breaks out into the</p>
<p>jolliest of all Canadian songs:</p>

<p>III.</p>
<p>THE ISLAND POOL.</p>
<p>Among the mountains there is a gorge.  And in the gorge there is a</p>
<p>river.  And in the river there is a pool.  And in the pool there is</p>
<p>an island.  And on the island, for four happy days, there was a</p>
<p>camp.</p>
<p>It was by no means an easy matter to establish ourselves in that</p>
<p>lonely place.  The river, though not remote from civilisation, is</p>
<p>practically inaccessible for nine miles of its course by reason of</p>
<p>the steepness of its banks, which are long, shaggy precipices, and</p>
<p>the fury of its current, in which no boat can live.  We heard its</p>
<p>voice as we approached through the forest, and could hardly tell</p>
<p>whether it was far away or near.</p>
<p>There is a perspective of sound as well as of sight, and one must</p>
<p>have some idea of the size of a noise before one can judge of its</p>
<p>distance.  A mosquito&#x27;s horn in a dark room may seem like a trumpet</p>
<p>on the battlements; and the tumult of a mighty stream heard through</p>
<p>an unknown stretch of woods may appear like the babble of a</p>
<p>mountain brook close at hand.</p>
<p>But when we came out upon the bald forehead of a burnt cliff and</p>
<p>looked down, we realised the grandeur and beauty of the unseen</p>
<p>voice that we had been following.  A river of splendid strength</p>
<p>went leaping through the chasm five hundred feet below us, and at</p>
<p>the foot of two snow-white falls, in an oval of dark topaz water,</p>
<p>traced with curves of floating foam, lay the solitary island.</p>
<p>The broken path was like a ladder.  &quot;How shall we ever get down?&quot;</p>
<p>sighed Greygown, as we dropped from rock to rock; and at the bottom</p>
<p>she looked up sighing, &quot;I know we never can get back again.&quot;  There</p>
<p>was not a foot of ground on the shores level enough for a tent.</p>
<p>Our canoe ferried us over, two at a time, to the island.  It was</p>
<p>about a hundred paces long, composed of round, coggly stones, with</p>
<p>just one patch of smooth sand at the lower end.  There was not a</p>
<p>tree left upon it larger than an alder-bush.  The tent-poles must</p>
<p>be cut far up on the mountain-sides, and every bough for our beds</p>
<p>must be carried down the ladder of rocks.  But the men were gay at</p>
<p>their work, singing like mocking-birds.  After all, the glow of</p>
<p>life comes from friction with its difficulties.  If we cannot find</p>
<p>them at home, we sally abroad and create them, just to warm up our</p>
<p>mettle.</p>
<p>The ouananiche in the island pool were superb, astonishing,</p>
<p>incredible.  We stood on the cobble-stones at the upper end, and</p>
<p>cast our little flies across the sweeping stream, and for three</p>
<p>days the fish came crowding in to fill the barrel of pickled salmon</p>
<p>for our guides&#x27; winter use; and the score rose,--twelve, twenty-</p>
<p>one, thirty-two; and the size of the &quot;biggest fish&quot; steadily</p>
<p>mounted--four pounds, four and a half, five, five and three-</p>
<p>quarters.  &quot;Precisely almost six pounds,&quot; said Ferdinand, holding</p>
<p>the scales; &quot;but we may call him six, M&#x27;sieu&#x27;, for if it had been</p>
<p>to-morrow that we had caught him, he would certainly have gained</p>
<p>the other ounce.&quot;  And yet, why should I repeat the fisherman&#x27;s</p>
<p>folly of writing down the record of that marvellous catch?  We</p>
<p>always do it, but we know that it is a vain thing.  Few listen to</p>
<p>the tale, and none accept it.  Does not Christopher North,</p>
<p>reviewing the Salmonia of Sir Humphry Davy, mock and jeer</p>
<p>unfeignedly at the fish stories of that most reputable writer?</p>
<p>But, on the very next page, old Christopher himself meanders</p>
<p>on into a perilous narrative of the day when he caught a whole</p>
<p>cart-load of trout in a Highland loch.  Incorrigible, happy</p>
<p>inconsistency!  Slow to believe others, and full of sceptical</p>
<p>inquiry, fond man never doubts one thing--that somewhere in the</p>
<p>world a tribe of gentle readers will be discovered to whom his fish</p>
<p>stories will appear credible.</p>
<p>One of our days on the island was Sunday--a day of rest in a week</p>
<p>of idleness.  We had a few books; for there are some in existence</p>
<p>which will stand the test of being brought into close contact with</p>
<p>nature.  Are not John Burroughs&#x27; cheerful, kindly essays full of</p>
<p>woodland truth and companionship?  Can you not carry a whole</p>
<p>library of musical philosophy in your pocket in Matthew Arnold&#x27;s</p>
<p>volume of selections from Wordsworth?  And could there be a better</p>
<p>sermon for a Sabbath in the wilderness than Mrs. Slosson&#x27;s immortal</p>
<p>story of Fishin&#x27; Jimmy?</p>
<p>But to be very frank about the matter, the camp is not stimulating</p>
<p>to the studious side of my mind.  Charles Lamb, as usual, has said</p>
<p>what I feel: &quot;I am not much a friend to out-of-doors reading.  I</p>
<p>cannot settle my spirits to it.&quot;</p>
<p>There are blueberries growing abundantly among the rocks--huge</p>
<p>clusters of them, bloomy and luscious as the grapes of Eshcol.  The</p>
<p>blueberry is nature&#x27;s compensation for the ruin of forest fires.</p>
<p>It grows best where the woods have been burned away and the soil is</p>
<p>too poor to raise another crop of trees.  Surely it is an innocent</p>
<p>and harmless pleasure to wander along the hillsides gathering these</p>
<p>wild fruits, as the Master and His disciples once walked through</p>
<p>the fields and plucked the ears of corn, never caring what the</p>
<p>Pharisees thought of that new way of keeping the Sabbath.</p>
<p>And here is a bed of moss beside a dashing rivulet, inviting us to</p>
<p>rest and be thankful.  Hark!  There is a white-throated sparrow, on</p>
<p>a little tree across the river, whistling his afternoon song</p>

<p>Down in Maine they call him the Peabody-bird, because his notes</p>
<p>sound to them like Old man--Peabody, peabody, peabody.  In New</p>
<p>Brunswick the Scotch settlers say that he sings Lost--lost--</p>
<p>Kennedy, kennedy, kennedy.  But here in his northern home I think</p>
<p>we can understand him better.  He is singing again and again, with</p>
<p>a cadence that never wearies, &quot;Sweet--sweet--Canada, canada,</p>
<p>canada!&quot;  The Canadians, when they came across the sea, remembering</p>
<p>the nightingale of southern France, baptised this little gray</p>
<p>minstrel their rossignol, and the country ballads are full of his</p>
<p>praise.  Every land has its nightingale, if we only have the heart</p>
<p>to hear him.  How distinct his voice is--how personal, how</p>
<p>confidential, as if he had a message for us!</p>
<p>There is a breath of fragrance on the cool shady air beside our</p>
<p>little stream, that seems familiar.  It is the first week of</p>
<p>September.  Can it be that the twin-flower of June, the delicate</p>
<p>Linnaea borealis, is blooming again?  Yes, here is the threadlike</p>
<p>stem lifting its two frail pink bells above the bed of shining</p>
<p>leaves.  How dear an early flower seems when it comes back again</p>
<p>and unfolds its beauty in a St. Martin&#x27;s summer!  How delicate and</p>
<p>suggestive is the faint, magical odour!  It is like a renewal of</p>
<p>the dreams of youth.</p>
<p>&quot;And need we ever grow old?&quot; asked my lady Greygown, as she sat</p>
<p>that evening with the twin-flower on her breast, watching the stars</p>
<p>come out along the edge of the cliffs, and tremble on the hurrying</p>
<p>tide of the river.  &quot;Must we grow old as well as gray?  Is the time</p>
<p>coming when all life will be commonplace and practical, and</p>
<p>governed by a dull &#x27;of course&#x27;?  Shall we not always find</p>
<p>adventures and romances, and a few blossoms returning, even when</p>
<p>the season grows late?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At least,&quot; I answered, &quot;let us believe in the possibility, for to</p>
<p>doubt it is to destroy it.  If we can only come back to nature</p>
<p>together every year, and consider the flowers and the birds, and</p>
<p>confess our faults and mistakes and our unbelief under these silent</p>
<p>stars, and hear the river murmuring our absolution, we shall die</p>
<p>young, even though we live long: we shall have a treasure of</p>
<p>memories which will be like the twin-flower, always a double</p>
<p>blossom on a single stem, and carry with us into the unseen world</p>
<p>something which will make it worth while to be immortal.&quot;</p>

<p>A SONG AFTER SUNDOWN</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s no music like a little river&#x27;s.  It plays the same tune</p>
<p>(and that&#x27;s the favourite) over and over again, and yet does not</p>
<p>weary of it like men fiddlers.  It takes the mind out of doors; and</p>
<p>though we should be grateful for good houses, there is, after all,</p>
<p>no house like god&#x27;s out-of-doors.  And lastly, sir, it quiets a man</p>
<p>down like saying his prayers.&quot;--ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: Prince</p>

<p>THE WOOD-NOTES OF THE VEERY</p>
<p>The moonbeams over Arno&#x27;s vale in silver flood were pouring,</p>
<p>When first I heard the nightingale a long-lost love deploring:</p>
<p>So passionate, so full of pain, it sounded strange and eerie,</p>
<p>I longed to hear a simpler strain, the wood-notes of the veery.</p>
<p>The laverock sings a bonny lay, above the Scottish heather,</p>
<p>It sprinkles from the dome of day like light and love together;</p>
<p>He drops the golden notes to greet his brooding mate, his dearie;</p>
<p>I only know one song more sweet, the vespers of the veery.</p>
<p>In English gardens green and bright, and rich in fruity treasure,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve heard the blackbird with delight repeat his merry measure;</p>
<p>The ballad was a lively one, the tune was loud and cheery,</p>
<p>And yet with every setting sun I listened for the veery.</p>
<p>O far away, and far away, the tawny thrush is singing,</p>
<p>New England woods at close of day with that clear chant are ringing;</p>
<p>And when my light of life is low, and heart and flesh are weary,</p>
<p>I fain would hear, before I go, the wood-notes of the veery.</p>
