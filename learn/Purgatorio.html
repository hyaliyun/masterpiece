Divine Comedy
translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>
<p>PURGATORIO</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto I</p>
<p>To run o&#x27;er better waters hoists its sail
The little vessel of my genius now,
That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;</p>
<p>And of that second kingdom will I sing
Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,
And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.</p>
<p>But let dead Poesy here rise again,
O holy Muses, since that I am yours,
And here Calliope somewhat ascend,</p>
<p>My song accompanying with that sound,
Of which the miserable magpies felt
The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.</p>
<p>Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,
That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect
Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,</p>
<p>Unto mine eyes did recommence delight
Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,
Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.</p>
<p>The beauteous planet, that to love incites,
Was making all the orient to laugh,
Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.</p>
<p>To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind
Upon the other pole, and saw four stars
Ne&#x27;er seen before save by the primal people.</p>
<p>Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.
O thou septentrional and widowed site,
Because thou art deprived of seeing these!</p>
<p>When from regarding them I had withdrawn,
Turning a little to the other pole,
There where the Wain had disappeared already,</p>
<p>I saw beside me an old man alone,
Worthy of so much reverence in his look,
That more owes not to father any son.</p>
<p>A long beard and with white hair intermingled
He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,
Of which a double list fell on his breast.</p>
<p>The rays of the four consecrated stars
Did so adorn his countenance with light,
That him I saw as were the sun before him.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,
Have fled away from the eternal prison?&quot;
Moving those venerable plumes, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;Who guided you? or who has been your lamp
In issuing forth out of the night profound,
That ever black makes the infernal valley?</p>
<p>The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?
Or is there changed in heaven some council new,
That being damned ye come unto my crags?&quot;</p>
<p>Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,
And with his words, and with his hands and signs,
Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;</p>
<p>Then answered him: &quot;I came not of myself;
A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers
I aided this one with my company.</p>
<p>But since it is thy will more be unfolded
Of our condition, how it truly is,
Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.</p>
<p>This one has never his last evening seen,
But by his folly was so near to it
That very little time was there to turn.</p>
<p>As I have said, I unto him was sent
To rescue him, and other way was none
Than this to which I have myself betaken.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve shown him all the people of perdition,
And now those spirits I intend to show
Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.</p>
<p>How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.
Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me
To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.</p>
<p>Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;
He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,
As knoweth he who life for her refuses.</p>
<p>Thou know&#x27;st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter
Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave
The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.</p>
<p>By us the eternal edicts are not broken;
Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;
But of that circle I, where are the chaste</p>
<p>Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,
O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;
For her love, then, incline thyself to us.</p>
<p>Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;
I will take back this grace from thee to her,
If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes
While I was on the other side,&quot; then said he,
&quot;That every grace she wished of me I granted;</p>
<p>Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,
She can no longer move me, by that law
Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.</p>
<p>But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,
As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;
Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.</p>
<p>Go, then, and see thou gird this one about
With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,
So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,</p>
<p>For &#x27;twere not fitting that the eye o&#x27;ercast
By any mist should go before the first
Angel, who is of those of Paradise.</p>
<p>This little island round about its base
Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,
Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;</p>
<p>No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,
Or that doth indurate, can there have life,
Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.</p>
<p>Thereafter be not this way your return;
The sun, which now is rising, will direct you
To take the mount by easier ascent.&quot;</p>
<p>With this he vanished; and I raised me up
Without a word, and wholly drew myself
Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.</p>
<p>And he began: &quot;Son, follow thou my steps;
Let us turn back, for on this side declines
The plain unto its lower boundaries.&quot;</p>
<p>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour
Which fled before it, so that from afar
I recognised the trembling of the sea.</p>
<p>Along the solitary plain we went
As one who unto the lost road returns,
And till he finds it seems to go in vain.</p>
<p>As soon as we were come to where the dew
Fights with the sun, and, being in a part
Where shadow falls, little evaporates,</p>
<p>Both of his hands upon the grass outspread
In gentle manner did my Master place;
Whence I, who of his action was aware,</p>
<p>Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;
There did he make in me uncovered wholly
That hue which Hell had covered up in me.</p>
<p>Then came we down upon the desert shore
Which never yet saw navigate its waters
Any that afterward had known return.</p>
<p>There he begirt me as the other pleased;
O marvellous! for even as he culled
The humble plant, such it sprang up again</p>
<p>Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto II</p>
<p>Already had the sun the horizon reached
Whose circle of meridian covers o&#x27;er
Jerusalem with its most lofty point,</p>
<p>And night that opposite to him revolves
Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales
That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;</p>
<p>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks
Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,
By too great age were changing into orange.</p>
<p>We still were on the border of the sea,
Like people who are thinking of their road,
Who go in heart and with the body stay;</p>
<p>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,
Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red
Down in the West upon the ocean floor,</p>
<p>Appeared to me--may I again behold it!--
A light along the sea so swiftly coming,
Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;</p>
<p>From which when I a little had withdrawn
Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,
Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</p>
<p>Then on each side of it appeared to me
I knew not what of white, and underneath it
Little by little there came forth another.</p>
<p>My Master yet had uttered not a word
While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;
But when he clearly recognised the pilot,</p>
<p>He cried: &quot;Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!
Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!
Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!</p>
<p>See how he scorneth human arguments,
So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail
Than his own wings, between so distant shores.</p>
<p>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,
Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,
That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!&quot;</p>
<p>Then as still nearer and more near us came
The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,
So that near by the eye could not endure him,</p>
<p>But down I cast it; and he came to shore
With a small vessel, very swift and light,
So that the water swallowed naught thereof.</p>
<p>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;
Beatitude seemed written in his face,
And more than a hundred spirits sat within.</p>
<p>&quot;In exitu Israel de Aegypto!&quot;
They chanted all together in one voice,
With whatso in that psalm is after written.</p>
<p>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,
Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,
And he departed swiftly as he came.</p>
<p>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar
Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,
As one who in new matters makes essay.</p>
<p>On every side was darting forth the day.
The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts
From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,</p>
<p>When the new people lifted up their faces
Towards us, saying to us: &quot;If ye know,
Show us the way to go unto the mountain.&quot;</p>
<p>And answer made Virgilius: &quot;Ye believe
Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,
But we are strangers even as yourselves.</p>
<p>Just now we came, a little while before you,
Another way, which was so rough and steep,
That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.&quot;</p>
<p>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,
Become aware that I was still alive,
Pallid in their astonishment became;</p>
<p>And as to messenger who bears the olive
The people throng to listen to the news,
And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,</p>
<p>So at the sight of me stood motionless
Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if
Oblivious to go and make them fair.</p>
<p>One from among them saw I coming forward,
As to embrace me, with such great affection,
That it incited me to do the like.</p>
<p>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!
Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,
As oft returned with them to my own breast!</p>
<p>I think with wonder I depicted me;
Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;
And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.</p>
<p>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;
Then knew I who it was, and I entreated
That it would stop awhile to speak with me.</p>
<p>It made reply to me: &quot;Even as I loved thee
In mortal body, so I love thee free;
Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My own Casella! to return once more
There where I am, I make this journey,&quot; said I;
&quot;But how from thee has so much time be taken?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;No outrage has been done me,
If he who takes both when and whom he pleases
Has many times denied to me this passage,</p>
<p>For of a righteous will his own is made.
He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken
Whoever wished to enter with all peace;</p>
<p>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore
Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,
Benignantly by him have been received.</p>
<p>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,
Because for evermore assemble there
Those who tow&#x27;rds Acheron do not descend.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;If some new law take not from thee
Memory or practice of the song of love,
Which used to quiet in me all my longings,</p>
<p>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal
Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body
Hitherward coming is so much distressed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Love, that within my mind discourses with me,&quot;
Forthwith began he so melodiously,
The melody within me still is sounding.</p>
<p>My Master, and myself, and all that people
Which with him were, appeared as satisfied
As if naught else might touch the mind of any.</p>
<p>We all of us were moveless and attentive
Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,
Exclaiming: &quot;What is this, ye laggard spirits?</p>
<p>What negligence, what standing still is this?
Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,
That lets not God be manifest to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,
The doves, together at their pasture met,
Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,</p>
<p>If aught appear of which they are afraid,
Upon a sudden leave their food alone,
Because they are assailed by greater care;</p>
<p>So that fresh company did I behold
The song relinquish, and go tow&#x27;rds the hill,
As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;</p>
<p>Nor was our own departure less in haste.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto III</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight
Had scattered them asunder o&#x27;er the plain,
Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,</p>
<p>I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,
And how without him had I kept my course?
Who would have led me up along the mountain?</p>
<p>He seemed to me within himself remorseful;
O noble conscience, and without a stain,
How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!</p>
<p>After his feet had laid aside the haste
Which mars the dignity of every act,
My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,</p>
<p>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,
And I my sight directed to the hill
That highest tow&#x27;rds the heaven uplifts itself.</p>
<p>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,
Was broken in front of me into the figure
Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;</p>
<p>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear
Of being left alone, when I beheld
Only in front of me the ground obscured.</p>
<p>&quot;Why dost thou still mistrust?&quot; my Comforter
Began to say to me turned wholly round;
&quot;Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?</p>
<p>&#x27;Tis evening there already where is buried
The body within which I cast a shadow;
&#x27;Tis from Brundusium ta&#x27;en, and Naples has it.</p>
<p>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,
Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,
Because one ray impedeth not another</p>
<p>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,
Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills
That how it works be not unveiled to us.</p>
<p>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason
Can traverse the illimitable way,
Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!</p>
<p>Mortals, remain contented at the &#x27;Quia;&#x27;
For if ye had been able to see all,
No need there were for Mary to give birth;</p>
<p>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,
Those whose desire would have been quieted,
Which evermore is given them for a grief.</p>
<p>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,
And many others;&quot;--and here bowed his head,
And more he said not, and remained disturbed.</p>
<p>We came meanwhile unto the mountain&#x27;s foot;
There so precipitate we found the rock,
That nimble legs would there have been in vain.</p>
<p>&#x27;Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,
The most secluded pathway is a stair
Easy and open, if compared with that.</p>
<p>&quot;Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill
Slopes down,&quot; my Master said, his footsteps staying,
&quot;So that who goeth without wings may mount?&quot;</p>
<p>And while he held his eyes upon the ground
Examining the nature of the path,
And I was looking up around the rock,</p>
<p>On the left hand appeared to me a throng
Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,
And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Lift up thine eyes,&quot; I to the Master said;
&quot;Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,
If thou of thine own self can have it not.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression
Replied: &quot;Let us go there, for they come slowly,
And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.&quot;</p>
<p>Still was that people as far off from us,
After a thousand steps of ours I say,
As a good thrower with his hand would reach,</p>
<p>When they all crowded unto the hard masses
Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,
As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!&quot;
Virgilius made beginning, &quot;by that peace
Which I believe is waiting for you all,</p>
<p>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,
So that the going up be possible,
For to lose time irks him most who most knows.&quot;</p>
<p>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold
By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand
Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,</p>
<p>And what the foremost does the others do,
Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,
Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;</p>
<p>So moving to approach us thereupon
I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,
Modest in face and dignified in gait.</p>
<p>As soon as those in the advance saw broken
The light upon the ground at my right side,
So that from me the shadow reached the rock,</p>
<p>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;
And all the others, who came after them,
Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Without your asking, I confess to you
This is a human body which you see,
Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.</p>
<p>Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded
That not without a power which comes from Heaven
Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master thus; and said those worthy people:
&quot;Return ye then, and enter in before us,&quot;
Making a signal with the back o&#x27; the hand</p>
<p>And one of them began: &quot;Whoe&#x27;er thou art,
Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well
If e&#x27;er thou saw me in the other world.&quot;</p>
<p>I turned me tow&#x27;rds him, and looked at him closely;
Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,
But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.</p>
<p>When with humility I had disclaimed
E&#x27;er having seen him, &quot;Now behold!&quot; he said,
And showed me high upon his breast a wound.</p>
<p>Then said he with a smile: &quot;I am Manfredi,
The grandson of the Empress Costanza;
Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee</p>
<p>Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother
Of Sicily&#x27;s honour and of Aragon&#x27;s,
And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.</p>
<p>After I had my body lacerated
By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself
Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.</p>
<p>Horrible my iniquities had been;
But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,
That it receives whatever turns to it.</p>
<p>Had but Cosenza&#x27;s pastor, who in chase
Of me was sent by Clement at that time,
In God read understandingly this page,</p>
<p>The bones of my dead body still would be
At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,
Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.</p>
<p>Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,
Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,
Where he transported them with tapers quenched.</p>
<p>By malison of theirs is not so lost
Eternal Love, that it cannot return,
So long as hope has anything of green.</p>
<p>True is it, who in contumacy dies
Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,
Must wait upon the outside this bank</p>
<p>Thirty times told the time that he has been
In his presumption, unless such decree
Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.</p>
<p>See now if thou hast power to make me happy,
By making known unto my good Costanza
How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,</p>
<p>For those on earth can much advance us here.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto IV</p>
<p>Whenever by delight or else by pain,
That seizes any faculty of ours,
Wholly to that the soul collects itself,</p>
<p>It seemeth that no other power it heeds;
And this against that error is which thinks
One soul above another kindles in us.</p>
<p>And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen
Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,
Time passes on, and we perceive it not,</p>
<p>Because one faculty is that which listens,
And other that which the soul keeps entire;
This is as if in bonds, and that is free.</p>
<p>Of this I had experience positive
In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;
For fifty full degrees uprisen was</p>
<p>The sun, and I had not perceived it, when
We came to where those souls with one accord
Cried out unto us: &quot;Here is what you ask.&quot;</p>
<p>A greater opening ofttimes hedges up
With but a little forkful of his thorns
The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,</p>
<p>Than was the passage-way through which ascended
Only my Leader and myself behind him,
After that company departed from us.</p>
<p>One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,
And mounts the summit of Bismantova,
With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;</p>
<p>With the swift pinions and the plumes I say
Of great desire, conducted after him
Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.</p>
<p>We mounted upward through the rifted rock,
And on each side the border pressed upon us,
And feet and hands the ground beneath required.</p>
<p>When we were come upon the upper rim
Of the high bank, out on the open slope,
&quot;My Master,&quot; said I, &quot;what way shall we take?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;No step of thine descend;
Still up the mount behind me win thy way,
Till some sage escort shall appear to us.&quot;</p>
<p>The summit was so high it vanquished sight,
And the hillside precipitous far more
Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.</p>
<p>Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:
&quot;O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold
How I remain alone, unless thou stay!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O son,&quot; he said, &quot;up yonder drag thyself,&quot;
Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,
Which on that side encircles all the hill.</p>
<p>These words of his so spurred me on, that I
Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,
Until the circle was beneath my feet.</p>
<p>Thereon ourselves we seated both of us
Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,
For all men are delighted to look back.</p>
<p>To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,
Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered
That on the left hand we were smitten by it.</p>
<p>The Poet well perceived that I was wholly
Bewildered at the chariot of the light,
Where &#x27;twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.</p>
<p>Whereon he said to me: &quot;If Castor and Pollux
Were in the company of yonder mirror,
That up and down conducteth with its light,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst behold the zodiac&#x27;s jagged wheel
Revolving still more near unto the Bears,
Unless it swerved aside from its old track.</p>
<p>How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,
Collected in thyself, imagine Zion
Together with this mount on earth to stand,</p>
<p>So that they both one sole horizon have,
And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road
Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,</p>
<p>Thou&#x27;lt see how of necessity must pass
This on one side, when that upon the other,
If thine intelligence right clearly heed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truly, my Master,&quot; said I, &quot;never yet
Saw I so clearly as I now discern,
There where my wit appeared incompetent,</p>
<p>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,
Which in some art is the Equator called,
And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,</p>
<p>For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence
Tow&#x27;rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews
Beheld it tow&#x27;rds the region of the heat.</p>
<p>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn
How far we have to go; for the hill rises
Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;This mount is such, that ever
At the beginning down below &#x27;tis tiresome,
And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</p>
<p>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,
That going up shall be to thee as easy
As going down the current in a boat,</p>
<p>Then at this pathway&#x27;s ending thou wilt be;
There to repose thy panting breath expect;
No more I answer; and this I know for true.&quot;</p>
<p>And as he finished uttering these words,
A voice close by us sounded: &quot;Peradventure
Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.&quot;</p>
<p>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,
And saw upon the left hand a great rock,
Which neither I nor he before had noticed.</p>
<p>Thither we drew; and there were persons there
Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,
As one through indolence is wont to stand.</p>
<p>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,
Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,
Holding his face low down between them bowed.</p>
<p>&quot;O my sweet Lord,&quot; I said, &quot;do turn thine eye
On him who shows himself more negligent
Then even Sloth herself his sister were.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,
Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,
And said: &quot;Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.&quot;</p>
<p>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,
That still a little did my breathing quicken,
My going to him hindered not; and after</p>
<p>I came to him he hardly raised his head,
Saying: &quot;Hast thou seen clearly how the sun
O&#x27;er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?&quot;</p>
<p>His sluggish attitude and his curt words
A little unto laughter moved my lips;
Then I began: &quot;Belacqua, I grieve not</p>
<p>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated
In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?
Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?&quot;</p>
<p>And he: &quot;O brother, what&#x27;s the use of climbing?
Since to my torment would not let me go
The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.</p>
<p>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round
Outside thereof, as in my life it did,
Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,</p>
<p>Unless, e&#x27;er that, some prayer may bring me aid
Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;
What profit others that in heaven are heard not?&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,
And saying: &quot;Come now; see the sun has touched
Meridian, and from the shore the night</p>
<p>Covers already with her foot Morocco.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto V</p>
<p>I had already from those shades departed,
And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,
When from behind, pointing his finger at me,</p>
<p>One shouted: &quot;See, it seems as if shone not
The sunshine on the left of him below,
And like one living seems he to conduct him.&quot;</p>
<p>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,
And saw them watching with astonishment
But me, but me, and the light which was broken!</p>
<p>&quot;Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,&quot;
The Master said, &quot;that thou thy pace dost slacken?
What matters it to thee what here is whispered?</p>
<p>Come after me, and let the people talk;
Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags
Its top for all the blowing of the winds;</p>
<p>For evermore the man in whom is springing
Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,
Because the force of one the other weakens.&quot;</p>
<p>What could I say in answer but &quot;I come&quot;?
I said it somewhat with that colour tinged
Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across
Came people in advance of us a little,
Singing the Miserere verse by verse.</p>
<p>When they became aware I gave no place
For passage of the sunshine through my body,
They changed their song into a long, hoarse &quot;Oh!&quot;</p>
<p>And two of them, in form of messengers,
Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,
&quot;Of your condition make us cognisant.&quot;</p>
<p>And said my Master: &quot;Ye can go your way
And carry back again to those who sent you,
That this one&#x27;s body is of very flesh.</p>
<p>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,
As I suppose, enough is answered them;
Him let them honour, it may profit them.&quot;</p>
<p>Vapours enkindled saw I ne&#x27;er so swiftly
At early nightfall cleave the air serene,
Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,</p>
<p>But upward they returned in briefer time,
And, on arriving, with the others wheeled
Tow&#x27;rds us, like troops that run without a rein.</p>
<p>&quot;This folk that presses unto us is great,
And cometh to implore thee,&quot; said the Poet;
&quot;So still go onward, and in going listen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O soul that goest to beatitude
With the same members wherewith thou wast born,&quot;
Shouting they came, &quot;a little stay thy steps,</p>
<p>Look, if thou e&#x27;er hast any of us seen,
So that o&#x27;er yonder thou bear news of him;
Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?</p>
<p>Long since we all were slain by violence,
And sinners even to the latest hour;
Then did a light from heaven admonish us,</p>
<p>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth
From life we issued reconciled to God,
Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;Although I gaze into your faces,
No one I recognize; but if may please you
Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,</p>
<p>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace
Which, following the feet of such a Guide,
From world to world makes itself sought by me.&quot;</p>
<p>And one began: &quot;Each one has confidence
In thy good offices without an oath,
Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;</p>
<p>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,
Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land
That &#x27;twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,</p>
<p>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers
In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,
That I may purge away my grave offences.</p>
<p>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which
Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,
Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,</p>
<p>There where I thought to be the most secure;
&#x27;Twas he of Este had it done, who held me
In hatred far beyond what justice willed.</p>
<p>But if towards the Mira I had fled,
When I was overtaken at Oriaco,
I still should be o&#x27;er yonder where men breathe.</p>
<p>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire
Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there
A lake made from my veins upon the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Then said another: &quot;Ah, be that desire
Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,
As thou with pious pity aidest mine.</p>
<p>I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;
Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;
Hence among these I go with downcast front.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;What violence or what chance
Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,
That never has thy sepulture been known?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he replied, &quot;at Casentino&#x27;s foot
A river crosses named Archiano, born
Above the Hermitage in Apennine.</p>
<p>There where the name thereof becometh void
Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,
Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;</p>
<p>There my sight lost I, and my utterance
Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat
I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.</p>
<p>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;
God&#x27;s Angel took me up, and he of hell
Shouted: &#x27;O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?</p>
<p>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,
For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;
But with the rest I&#x27;ll deal in other fashion!&#x27;</p>
<p>Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered
That humid vapour which to water turns,
Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.</p>
<p>He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,
To intellect, and moved the mist and wind
By means of power, which his own nature gave;</p>
<p>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley
From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered
With fog, and made the heaven above intent,</p>
<p>So that the pregnant air to water changed;
Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came
Whate&#x27;er of it earth tolerated not;</p>
<p>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,
Towards the royal river with such speed
It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.</p>
<p>My frozen body near unto its outlet
The robust Archian found, and into Arno
Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross</p>
<p>I made of me, when agony o&#x27;ercame me;
It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,
Then with its booty covered and begirt me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,
And rested thee from thy long journeying,&quot;
After the second followed the third spirit,</p>
<p>&quot;Do thou remember me who am the Pia;
Siena made me, unmade me Maremma;
He knoweth it, who had encircled first,</p>
<p>Espousing me, my finger with his gem.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto VI</p>
<p>Whene&#x27;er is broken up the game of Zara,
He who has lost remains behind despondent,
The throws repeating, and in sadness learns;</p>
<p>The people with the other all depart;
One goes in front, and one behind doth pluck him,
And at his side one brings himself to mind;</p>
<p>He pauses not, and this and that one hears;
They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches,
And from the throng he thus defends himself.</p>
<p>Even such was I in that dense multitude,
Turning to them this way and that my face,
And, promising, I freed myself therefrom.</p>
<p>There was the Aretine, who from the arms
Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death,
And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned.</p>
<p>There was imploring with his hands outstretched
Frederick Novello, and that one of Pisa
Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong.</p>
<p>I saw Count Orso; and the soul divided
By hatred and by envy from its body,
As it declared, and not for crime committed,</p>
<p>Pierre de la Brosse I say; and here provide
While still on earth the Lady of Brabant,
So that for this she be of no worse flock!</p>
<p>As soon as I was free from all those shades
Who only prayed that some one else may pray,
So as to hasten their becoming holy,</p>
<p>Began I: &quot;It appears that thou deniest,
O light of mine, expressly in some text,
That orison can bend decree of Heaven;</p>
<p>And ne&#x27;ertheless these people pray for this.
Might then their expectation bootless be?
Or is to me thy saying not quite clear?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;My writing is explicit,
And not fallacious is the hope of these,
If with sane intellect &#x27;tis well regarded;</p>
<p>For top of judgment doth not vail itself,
Because the fire of love fulfils at once
What he must satisfy who here installs him.</p>
<p>And there, where I affirmed that proposition,
Defect was not amended by a prayer,
Because the prayer from God was separate.</p>
<p>Verily, in so deep a questioning
Do not decide, unless she tell it thee,
Who light &#x27;twixt truth and intellect shall be.</p>
<p>I know not if thou understand; I speak
Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above,
Smiling and happy, on this mountain&#x27;s top.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;Good Leader, let us make more haste,
For I no longer tire me as before;
And see, e&#x27;en now the hill a shadow casts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will go forward with this day&quot; he answered,
&quot;As far as now is possible for us;
But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest.</p>
<p>Ere thou art up there, thou shalt see return
Him, who now hides himself behind the hill,
So that thou dost not interrupt his rays.</p>
<p>But yonder there behold! a soul that stationed
All, all alone is looking hitherward;
It will point out to us the quickest way.&quot;</p>
<p>We came up unto it; O Lombard soul,
How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee,
And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes!</p>
<p>Nothing whatever did it say to us,
But let us go our way, eying us only
After the manner of a couchant lion;</p>
<p>Still near to it Virgilius drew, entreating
That it would point us out the best ascent;
And it replied not unto his demand,</p>
<p>But of our native land and of our life
It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began:
&quot;Mantua,&quot;--and the shade, all in itself recluse,</p>
<p>Rose tow&#x27;rds him from the place where first it was,
Saying: &quot;O Mantuan, I am Sordello
Of thine own land!&quot; and one embraced the other.</p>
<p>Ah! servile Italy, grief&#x27;s hostelry!
A ship without a pilot in great tempest!
No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!</p>
<p>That noble soul was so impatient, only
At the sweet sound of his own native land,
To make its citizen glad welcome there;</p>
<p>And now within thee are not without war
Thy living ones, and one doth gnaw the other
Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in!</p>
<p>Search, wretched one, all round about the shores
Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,
If any part of thee enjoyeth peace!</p>
<p>What boots it, that for thee Justinian
The bridle mend, if empty be the saddle?
Withouten this the shame would be the less.</p>
<p>Ah! people, thou that oughtest to be devout,
And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,
If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee,</p>
<p>Behold how fell this wild beast has become,
Being no longer by the spur corrected,
Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle.</p>
<p>O German Albert! who abandonest
Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage,
And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow,</p>
<p>May a just judgment from the stars down fall
Upon thy blood, and be it new and open,
That thy successor may have fear thereof;</p>
<p>Because thy father and thyself have suffered,
By greed of those transalpine lands distrained,
The garden of the empire to be waste.</p>
<p>Come and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti,
Monaldi and Fillippeschi, careless man!
Those sad already, and these doubt-depressed!</p>
<p>Come, cruel one! come and behold the oppression
Of thy nobility, and cure their wounds,
And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore!</p>
<p>Come and behold thy Rome, that is lamenting,
Widowed, alone, and day and night exclaims,
&quot;My Caesar, why hast thou forsaken me?&quot;</p>
<p>Come and behold how loving are the people;
And if for us no pity moveth thee,
Come and be made ashamed of thy renown!</p>
<p>And if it lawful be, O Jove Supreme!
Who upon earth for us wast crucified,
Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere?</p>
<p>Or preparation is &#x27;t, that, in the abyss
Of thine own counsel, for some good thou makest
From our perception utterly cut off?</p>
<p>For all the towns of Italy are full
Of tyrants, and becometh a Marcellus
Each peasant churl who plays the partisan!</p>
<p>My Florence! well mayst thou contented be
With this digression, which concerns thee not,
Thanks to thy people who such forethought take!</p>
<p>Many at heart have justice, but shoot slowly,
That unadvised they come not to the bow,
But on their very lips thy people have it!</p>
<p>Many refuse to bear the common burden;
But thy solicitous people answereth
Without being asked, and crieth: &quot;I submit.&quot;</p>
<p>Now be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason;
Thou affluent, thou in peace, thou full of wisdom!
If I speak true, the event conceals it not.</p>
<p>Athens and Lacedaemon, they who made
The ancient laws, and were so civilized,
Made towards living well a little sign</p>
<p>Compared with thee, who makest such fine-spun
Provisions, that to middle of November
Reaches not what thou in October spinnest.</p>
<p>How oft, within the time of thy remembrance,
Laws, money, offices, and usages
Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members?</p>
<p>And if thou mind thee well, and see the light,
Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman,
Who cannot find repose upon her down,</p>
<p>But by her tossing wardeth off her pain.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto VII</p>
<p>After the gracious and glad salutations
Had three and four times been reiterated,
Sordello backward drew and said, &quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or ever to this mountain were directed
The souls deserving to ascend to God,
My bones were buried by Octavian.</p>
<p>I am Virgilius; and for no crime else
Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith;&quot;
In this wise then my Leader made reply.</p>
<p>As one who suddenly before him sees
Something whereat he marvels, who believes
And yet does not, saying, &quot;It is! it is not!&quot;</p>
<p>So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,
And with humility returned towards him,
And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.</p>
<p>&quot;O glory of the Latians, thou,&quot; he said,
&quot;Through whom our language showed what it could do
O pride eternal of the place I came from,</p>
<p>What merit or what grace to me reveals thee?
If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me
If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through all the circles of the doleful realm,&quot;
Responded he, &quot;have I come hitherward;
Heaven&#x27;s power impelled me, and with that I come.</p>
<p>I by not doing, not by doing, lost
The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,
And which too late by me was recognized.</p>
<p>A place there is below not sad with torments,
But darkness only, where the lamentations
Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.</p>
<p>There dwell I with the little innocents
Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they
Were from our human sinfulness exempt.</p>
<p>There dwell I among those who the three saintly
Virtues did not put on, and without vice
The others knew and followed all of them.</p>
<p>But if thou know and can, some indication
Give us by which we may the sooner come
Where Purgatory has its right beginning.&quot;</p>
<p>He answered: &quot;No fixed place has been assigned us;
&#x27;Tis lawful for me to go up and round;
So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.</p>
<p>But see already how the day declines,
And to go up by night we are not able;
Therefore &#x27;tis well to think of some fair sojourn.</p>
<p>Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;
If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,
And thou shalt know them not without delight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How is this?&quot; was the answer; &quot;should one wish
To mount by night would he prevented be
By others? or mayhap would not have power?&quot;</p>
<p>And on the ground the good Sordello drew
His finger, saying, &quot;See, this line alone
Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;</p>
<p>Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,
To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;
This with the want of power the will perplexes.</p>
<p>We might indeed therewith return below,
And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,
While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.&quot;</p>
<p>Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:
&quot;Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest
That we can take delight in tarrying.&quot;</p>
<p>Little had we withdrawn us from that place,
When I perceived the mount was hollowed out
In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.</p>
<p>&quot;Thitherward,&quot; said that shade, &quot;will we repair,
Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,
And there for the new day will we await.&quot;</p>
<p>&#x27;Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path
Which led us to the margin of that dell,
Where dies the border more than half away.</p>
<p>Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,
The Indian wood resplendent and serene,
Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,</p>
<p>By herbage and by flowers within that hollow
Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished,
As by its greater vanquished is the less.</p>
<p>Nor in that place had nature painted only,
But of the sweetness of a thousand odours
Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.</p>
<p>&quot;Salve Regina,&quot; on the green and flowers
There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,
Which were not visible outside the valley.</p>
<p>&quot;Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,&quot;
Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,
&quot;Among them do not wish me to conduct you.</p>
<p>Better from off this ledge the acts and faces
Of all of them will you discriminate,
Than in the plain below received among them.</p>
<p>He who sits highest, and the semblance bears
Of having what he should have done neglected,
And to the others&#x27; song moves not his lips,</p>
<p>Rudolph the Emperor was, who had the power
To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,
So that through others slowly she revives.</p>
<p>The other, who in look doth comfort him,
Governed the region where the water springs,
The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea.</p>
<p>His name was Ottocar; and in swaddling-clothes
Far better he than bearded Winceslaus
His son, who feeds in luxury and ease.</p>
<p>And the small-nosed, who close in council seems
With him that has an aspect so benign,
Died fleeing and disflowering the lily;</p>
<p>Look there, how he is beating at his breast!
Behold the other one, who for his cheek
Sighing has made of his own palm a bed;</p>
<p>Father and father-in-law of France&#x27;s Pest
Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd,
And hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them.</p>
<p>He who appears so stalwart, and chimes in,
Singing, with that one of the manly nose,
The cord of every valour wore begirt;</p>
<p>And if as King had after him remained
The stripling who in rear of him is sitting,
Well had the valour passed from vase to vase,</p>
<p>Which cannot of the other heirs be said.
Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms,
But none the better heritage possesses.</p>
<p>Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches
The probity of man; and this He wills
Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him.</p>
<p>Eke to the large-nosed reach my words, no less
Than to the other, Pier, who with him sings;
Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already</p>
<p>The plant is as inferior to its seed,
As more than Beatrice and Margaret
Costanza boasteth of her husband still.</p>
<p>Behold the monarch of the simple life,
Harry of England, sitting there alone;
He in his branches has a better issue.</p>
<p>He who the lowest on the ground among them
Sits looking upward, is the Marquis William,
For whose sake Alessandria and her war</p>
<p>Make Monferrat and Canavese weep.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto VIII</p>
<p>&#x27;Twas now the hour that turneth back desire
In those who sail the sea, and melts the heart,
The day they&#x27;ve said to their sweet friends farewell,</p>
<p>And the new pilgrim penetrates with love,
If he doth hear from far away a bell
That seemeth to deplore the dying day,</p>
<p>When I began to make of no avail
My hearing, and to watch one of the souls
Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.</p>
<p>It joined and lifted upward both its palms,
Fixing its eyes upon the orient,
As if it said to God, &quot;Naught else I care for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Te lucis ante&quot; so devoutly issued
Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,
It made me issue forth from my own mind.</p>
<p>And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,
Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,
Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.</p>
<p>Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,
For now indeed so subtile is the veil,
Surely to penetrate within is easy.</p>
<p>I saw that army of the gentle-born
Thereafterward in silence upward gaze,
As if in expectation, pale and humble;</p>
<p>And from on high come forth and down descend,
I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,
Truncated and deprived of their points.</p>
<p>Green as the little leaflets just now born
Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions
Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.</p>
<p>One just above us came to take his station,
And one descended to the opposite bank,
So that the people were contained between them.</p>
<p>Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;
But in their faces was the eye bewildered,
As faculty confounded by excess.</p>
<p>&quot;From Mary&#x27;s bosom both of them have come,&quot;
Sordello said, &quot;as guardians of the valley
Against the serpent, that will come anon.&quot;</p>
<p>Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,
Turned round about, and closely drew myself,
Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.</p>
<p>And once again Sordello: &quot;Now descend we
&#x27;Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;
Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>Only three steps I think that I descended,
And was below, and saw one who was looking
Only at me, as if he fain would know me.</p>
<p>Already now the air was growing dark,
But not so that between his eyes and mine
It did not show what it before locked up.</p>
<p>Tow&#x27;rds me he moved, and I tow&#x27;rds him did move;
Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,
When I beheld thee not among the damned!</p>
<p>No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;
Then asked he: &quot;How long is it since thou camest
O&#x27;er the far waters to the mountain&#x27;s foot?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said I to him, &quot;through the dismal places
I came this morn; and am in the first life,
Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.&quot;</p>
<p>And on the instant my reply was heard,
He and Sordello both shrank back from me,
Like people who are suddenly bewildered.</p>
<p>One to Virgilius, and the other turned
To one who sat there, crying, &quot;Up, Currado!
Come and behold what God in grace has willed!&quot;</p>
<p>Then, turned to me: &quot;By that especial grace
Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals
His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,</p>
<p>When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,
Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,
Where answer to the innocent is made.</p>
<p>I do not think her mother loves me more,
Since she has laid aside her wimple white,
Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.</p>
<p>Through her full easily is comprehended
How long in woman lasts the fire of love,
If eye or touch do not relight it often.</p>
<p>So fair a hatchment will not make for her
The Viper marshalling the Milanese
A-field, as would have made Gallura&#x27;s Cock.&quot;</p>
<p>In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed
Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal
Which measurably burneth in the heart.</p>
<p>My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,
Still to that point where slowest are the stars,
Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.</p>
<p>And my Conductor: &quot;Son, what dost thou gaze at
Up there?&quot;  And I to him: &quot;At those three torches
With which this hither pole is all on fire.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;The four resplendent stars
Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,
And these have mounted up to where those were.&quot;</p>
<p>As he was speaking, to himself Sordello
Drew him, and said, &quot;Lo there our Adversary!&quot;
And pointed with his finger to look thither.</p>
<p>Upon the side on which the little valley
No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance
The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.</p>
<p>&#x27;Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,
Turning at times its head about, and licking
Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.</p>
<p>I did not see, and therefore cannot say
How the celestial falcons &#x27;gan to move,
But well I saw that they were both in motion.</p>
<p>Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,
The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,
Up to their stations flying back alike.</p>
<p>The shade that to the Judge had near approached
When he had called, throughout that whole assault
Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.</p>
<p>&quot;So may the light that leadeth thee on high
Find in thine own free-will as much of wax
As needful is up to the highest azure,&quot;</p>
<p>Began it, &quot;if some true intelligence
Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood
Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there.</p>
<p>Currado Malaspina was I called;
I&#x27;m not the elder, but from him descended;
To mine I bore the love which here refineth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O,&quot; said I unto him, &quot;through your domains
I never passed, but where is there a dwelling
Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?</p>
<p>That fame, which doeth honour to your house,
Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,
So that he knows of them who ne&#x27;er was there.</p>
<p>And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you
Your honoured family in naught abates
The glory of the purse and of the sword.</p>
<p>It is so privileged by use and nature,
That though a guilty head misguide the world,
Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.&quot;</p>
<p>And he: &quot;Now go; for the sun shall not lie
Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram
With all his four feet covers and bestrides,</p>
<p>Before that such a courteous opinion
Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed
With greater nails than of another&#x27;s speech,</p>
<p>Unless the course of justice standeth still.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto IX</p>
<p>The concubine of old Tithonus now
Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,
Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;</p>
<p>With gems her forehead all relucent was,
Set in the shape of that cold animal
Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,</p>
<p>And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night
Had taken two in that place where we were,
And now the third was bending down its wings;</p>
<p>When I, who something had of Adam in me,
Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,
There were all five of us already sat.</p>
<p>Just at the hour when her sad lay begins
The little swallow, near unto the morning,
Perchance in memory of her former woes,</p>
<p>And when the mind of man, a wanderer
More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,
Almost prophetic in its visions is,</p>
<p>In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended
An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,
With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,</p>
<p>And this, it seemed to me, was where had been
By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,
When to the high consistory he was rapt.</p>
<p>I thought within myself, perchance he strikes
From habit only here, and from elsewhere
Disdains to bear up any in his feet.</p>
<p>Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,
Terrible as the lightning he descended,
And snatched me upward even to the fire.</p>
<p>Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,
And the imagined fire did scorch me so,
That of necessity my sleep was broken.</p>
<p>Not otherwise Achilles started up,
Around him turning his awakened eyes,
And knowing not the place in which he was,</p>
<p>What time from Chiron stealthily his mother
Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,
Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,</p>
<p>Than I upstarted, when from off my face
Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,
As doth the man who freezes with affright.</p>
<p>Only my Comforter was at my side,
And now the sun was more than two hours high,
And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.</p>
<p>&quot;Be not intimidated,&quot; said my Lord,
&quot;Be reassured, for all is well with us;
Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.</p>
<p>Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;
See there the cliff that closes it around;
See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.</p>
<p>Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,
When inwardly thy spirit was asleep
Upon the flowers that deck the land below,</p>
<p>There came a Lady and said: &#x27;I am Lucia;
Let me take this one up, who is asleep;
So will I make his journey easier for him.&#x27;</p>
<p>Sordello and the other noble shapes
Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,
Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.</p>
<p>She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes
That open entrance pointed out to me;
Then she and sleep together went away.&quot;</p>
<p>In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,
And who to confidence his fear doth change,
After the truth has been discovered to him,</p>
<p>So did I change; and when without disquiet
My Leader saw me, up along the cliff
He moved, and I behind him, tow&#x27;rd the height.</p>
<p>Reader, thou seest well how I exalt
My theme, and therefore if with greater art
I fortify it, marvel not thereat.</p>
<p>Nearer approached we, and were in such place,
That there, where first appeared to me a rift
Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,</p>
<p>I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,
Diverse in colour, to go up to it,
And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.</p>
<p>And as I opened more and more mine eyes,
I saw him seated on the highest stair,
Such in the face that I endured it not.</p>
<p>And in his hand he had a naked sword,
Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow&#x27;rds us,
That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell it from where you are, what is&#x27;t you wish?&quot;
Began he to exclaim; &quot;where is the escort?
Take heed your coming hither harm you not!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,&quot;
My Master answered him, &quot;but even now
Said to us, &#x27;Thither go; there is the portal.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And may she speed your footsteps in all good,&quot;
Again began the courteous janitor;
&quot;Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.&quot;</p>
<p>Thither did we approach; and the first stair
Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,
I mirrored myself therein as I appear.</p>
<p>The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,
Was of a calcined and uneven stone,
Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.</p>
<p>The third, that uppermost rests massively,
Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red
As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.</p>
<p>Both of his feet was holding upon this
The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,
Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.</p>
<p>Along the three stairs upward with good will
Did my Conductor draw me, saying: &quot;Ask
Humbly that he the fastening may undo.&quot;</p>
<p>Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,
For mercy&#x27;s sake besought that he would open,
But first upon my breast three times I smote.</p>
<p>Seven P&#x27;s upon my forehead he described
With the sword&#x27;s point, and, &quot;Take heed that thou wash
These wounds, when thou shalt be within,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,
Of the same colour were with his attire,
And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.</p>
<p>One was of gold, and the other was of silver;
First with the white, and after with the yellow,
Plied he the door, so that I was content.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever faileth either of these keys
So that it turn not rightly in the lock,&quot;
He said to us, &quot;this entrance doth not open.</p>
<p>More precious one is, but the other needs
More art and intellect ere it unlock,
For it is that which doth the knot unloose.</p>
<p>From Peter I have them; and he bade me err
Rather in opening than in keeping shut,
If people but fall down before my feet.&quot;</p>
<p>Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,
Exclaiming: &quot;Enter; but I give you warning
That forth returns whoever looks behind.&quot;</p>
<p>And when upon their hinges were turned round
The swivels of that consecrated gate,
Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,</p>
<p>Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed
Tarpeia, when was ta&#x27;en from it the good
Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.</p>
<p>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,
And &quot;Te Deum laudamus&quot; seemed to hear
In voices mingled with sweet melody.</p>
<p>Exactly such an image rendered me
That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,
When people singing with the organ stand;</p>
<p>For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto X</p>
<p>When we had crossed the threshold of the door
Which the perverted love of souls disuses,
Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,</p>
<p>Re-echoing I heard it closed again;
And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,
What for my failing had been fit excuse?</p>
<p>We mounted upward through a rifted rock,
Which undulated to this side and that,
Even as a wave receding and advancing.</p>
<p>&quot;Here it behoves us use a little art,&quot;
Began my Leader, &quot;to adapt ourselves
Now here, now there, to the receding side.&quot;</p>
<p>And this our footsteps so infrequent made,
That sooner had the moon&#x27;s decreasing disk
Regained its bed to sink again to rest,</p>
<p>Than we were forth from out that needle&#x27;s eye;
But when we free and in the open were,
There where the mountain backward piles itself,</p>
<p>I wearied out, and both of us uncertain
About our way, we stopped upon a plain
More desolate than roads across the deserts.</p>
<p>From where its margin borders on the void,
To foot of the high bank that ever rises,
A human body three times told would measure;</p>
<p>And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,
Now on the left, and on the right flank now,
The same this cornice did appear to me.</p>
<p>Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,
When I perceived the embankment round about,
Which all right of ascent had interdicted,</p>
<p>To be of marble white, and so adorned
With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,
But Nature&#x27;s self, had there been put to shame.</p>
<p>The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings
Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,
And opened Heaven from its long interdict,</p>
<p>In front of us appeared so truthfully
There sculptured in a gracious attitude,
He did not seem an image that is silent.</p>
<p>One would have sworn that he was saying, &quot;Ave;&quot;
For she was there in effigy portrayed
Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,</p>
<p>And in her mien this language had impressed,
&quot;Ecce ancilla Dei,&quot; as distinctly
As any figure stamps itself in wax.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,&quot;
The gentle Master said, who had me standing
Upon that side where people have their hearts;</p>
<p>Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld
In rear of Mary, and upon that side
Where he was standing who conducted me,</p>
<p>Another story on the rock imposed;
Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,
So that before mine eyes it might be set.</p>
<p>There sculptured in the self-same marble were
The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,
Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.</p>
<p>People appeared in front, and all of them
In seven choirs divided, of two senses
Made one say &quot;No,&quot; the other, &quot;Yes, they sing.&quot;</p>
<p>Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,
Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose
Were in the yes and no discordant made.</p>
<p>Preceded there the vessel benedight,
Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,
And more and less than King was he in this.</p>
<p>Opposite, represented at the window
Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,
Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.</p>
<p>I moved my feet from where I had been standing,
To examine near at hand another story,
Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.</p>
<p>There the high glory of the Roman Prince
Was chronicled, whose great beneficence
Moved Gregory to his great victory;</p>
<p>&#x27;Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;
And a poor widow at his bridle stood,
In attitude of weeping and of grief.</p>
<p>Around about him seemed it thronged and full
Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold
Above them visibly in the wind were moving.</p>
<p>The wretched woman in the midst of these
Seemed to be saying: &quot;Give me vengeance, Lord,
For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to answer her: &quot;Now wait until
I shall return.&quot;  And she: &quot;My Lord,&quot; like one
In whom grief is impatient, &quot;shouldst thou not</p>
<p>Return?&quot;  And he: &quot;Who shall be where I am
Will give it thee.&quot;  And she: &quot;Good deed of others
What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?&quot;</p>
<p>Whence he: &quot;Now comfort thee, for it behoves me
That I discharge my duty ere I move;
Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.&quot;</p>
<p>He who on no new thing has ever looked
Was the creator of this visible language,
Novel to us, for here it is not found.</p>
<p>While I delighted me in contemplating
The images of such humility,
And dear to look on for their Maker&#x27;s sake,</p>
<p>&quot;Behold, upon this side, but rare they make
Their steps,&quot; the Poet murmured, &quot;many people;
These will direct us to the lofty stairs.&quot;</p>
<p>Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent
To see new things, of which they curious are,
In turning round towards him were not slow.</p>
<p>But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve
From thy good purposes, because thou hearest
How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;</p>
<p>Attend not to the fashion of the torment,
Think of what follows; think that at the worst
It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;Master,&quot; began I, &quot;that which I behold
Moving towards us seems to me not persons,
And what I know not, so in sight I waver.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;The grievous quality
Of this their torment bows them so to earth,
That my own eyes at first contended with it;</p>
<p>But look there fixedly, and disentangle
By sight what cometh underneath those stones;
Already canst thou see how each is stricken.&quot;</p>
<p>O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!
Who, in the vision of the mind infirm
Confidence have in your backsliding steps,</p>
<p>Do ye not comprehend that we are worms,
Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly
That flieth unto judgment without screen?</p>
<p>Why floats aloft your spirit high in air?
Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,
Even as the worm in whom formation fails!</p>
<p>As to sustain a ceiling or a roof,
In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure
Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,</p>
<p>Which makes of the unreal real anguish
Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus
Beheld I those, when I had ta&#x27;en good heed.</p>
<p>True is it, they were more or less bent down,
According as they more or less were laden;
And he who had most patience in his looks</p>
<p>Weeping did seem to say, &quot;I can no more!&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XI</p>
<p>&quot;Our Father, thou who dwellest in the heavens,
Not circumscribed, but from the greater love
Thou bearest to the first effects on high,</p>
<p>Praised be thy name and thine omnipotence
By every creature, as befitting is
To render thanks to thy sweet effluence.</p>
<p>Come unto us the peace of thy dominion,
For unto it we cannot of ourselves,
If it come not, with all our intellect.</p>
<p>Even as thine own Angels of their will
Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing,
So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.</p>
<p>Give unto us this day our daily manna,
Withouten which in this rough wilderness
Backward goes he who toils most to advance.</p>
<p>And even as we the trespass we have suffered
Pardon in one another, pardon thou
Benignly, and regard not our desert.</p>
<p>Our virtue, which is easily o&#x27;ercome,
Put not to proof with the old Adversary,
But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver.</p>
<p>This last petition verily, dear Lord,
Not for ourselves is made, who need it not,
But for their sake who have remained behind us.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus for themselves and us good furtherance
Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight
Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,</p>
<p>Unequally in anguish round and round
And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,
Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.</p>
<p>If there good words are always said for us,
What may not here be said and done for them,
By those who have a good root to their will?</p>
<p>Well may we help them wash away the marks
That hence they carried, so that clean and light
They may ascend unto the starry wheels!</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden
Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing,
That shall uplift you after your desire,</p>
<p>Show us on which hand tow&#x27;rd the stairs the way
Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,
Point us out that which least abruptly falls;</p>
<p>For he who cometh with me, through the burden
Of Adam&#x27;s flesh wherewith he is invested,
Against his will is chary of his climbing.&quot;</p>
<p>The words of theirs which they returned to those
That he whom I was following had spoken,
It was not manifest from whom they came,</p>
<p>But it was said: &quot;To the right hand come with us
Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass
Possible for living person to ascend.</p>
<p>And were I not impeded by the stone,
Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate,
Whence I am forced to hold my visage down,</p>
<p>Him, who still lives and does not name himself,
Would I regard, to see if I may know him
And make him piteous unto this burden.</p>
<p>A Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;
Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;
I know not if his name were ever with you.</p>
<p>The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry
Of my progenitors so arrogant made me
That, thinking not upon the common mother,</p>
<p>All men I held in scorn to such extent
I died therefor, as know the Sienese,
And every child in Campagnatico.</p>
<p>I am Omberto; and not to me alone
Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin
Has with it dragged into adversity.</p>
<p>And here must I this burden bear for it
Till God be satisfied, since I did not
Among the living, here among the dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Listening I downward bent my countenance;
And one of them, not this one who was speaking,
Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,</p>
<p>And looked at me, and knew me, and called out,
Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed
On me, who all bowed down was going with them.</p>
<p>&quot;O,&quot; asked I him, &quot;art thou not Oderisi,
Agobbio&#x27;s honour, and honour of that art
Which is in Paris called illuminating?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brother,&quot; said he, &quot;more laughing are the leaves
Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese;
All his the honour now, and mine in part.</p>
<p>In sooth I had not been so courteous
While I was living, for the great desire
Of excellence, on which my heart was bent.</p>
<p>Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture;
And yet I should not be here, were it not
That, having power to sin, I turned to God.</p>
<p>O thou vain glory of the human powers,
How little green upon thy summit lingers,
If&#x27;t be not followed by an age of grossness!</p>
<p>In painting Cimabue thought that he
Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,
So that the other&#x27;s fame is growing dim.</p>
<p>So has one Guido from the other taken
The glory of our tongue, and he perchance
Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.</p>
<p>Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath
Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,
And changes name, because it changes side.</p>
<p>What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off
From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead
Before thou left the &#x27;pappo&#x27; and the &#x27;dindi,&#x27;</p>
<p>Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter
Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye
Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest.</p>
<p>With him, who takes so little of the road
In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;
And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,</p>
<p>Where he was lord, what time was overthrown
The Florentine delirium, that superb
Was at that day as now &#x27;tis prostitute.</p>
<p>Your reputation is the colour of grass
Which comes and goes, and that discolours it
By which it issues green from out the earth.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;Thy true speech fills my heart with good
Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;
But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That,&quot; he replied, &quot;is Provenzan Salvani,
And he is here because he had presumed
To bring Siena all into his hands.</p>
<p>He has gone thus, and goeth without rest
E&#x27;er since he died; such money renders back
In payment he who is on earth too daring.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;If every spirit who awaits
The verge of life before that he repent,
Remains below there and ascends not hither,</p>
<p>(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)
Until as much time as he lived be passed,
How was the coming granted him in largess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When he in greatest splendour lived,&quot; said he,
&quot;Freely upon the Campo of Siena,
All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;</p>
<p>And there to draw his friend from the duress
Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,
He brought himself to tremble in each vein.</p>
<p>I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;
Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours
Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.</p>
<p>This action has released him from those confines.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XII</p>
<p>Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,
I with that heavy-laden soul went on,
As long as the sweet pedagogue permitted;</p>
<p>But when he said, &quot;Leave him, and onward pass,
For here &#x27;tis good that with the sail and oars,
As much as may be, each push on his barque;&quot;</p>
<p>Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed
My person, notwithstanding that my thoughts
Remained within me downcast and abashed.</p>
<p>I had moved on, and followed willingly
The footsteps of my Master, and we both
Already showed how light of foot we were,</p>
<p>When unto me he said: &quot;Cast down thine eyes;
&#x27;Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way,
To look upon the bed beneath thy feet.&quot;</p>
<p>As, that some memory may exist of them,
Above the buried dead their tombs in earth
Bear sculptured on them what they were before;</p>
<p>Whence often there we weep for them afresh,
From pricking of remembrance, which alone
To the compassionate doth set its spur;</p>
<p>So saw I there, but of a better semblance
In point of artifice, with figures covered
Whate&#x27;er as pathway from the mount projects.</p>
<p>I saw that one who was created noble
More than all other creatures, down from heaven
Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side.</p>
<p>I saw Briareus smitten by the dart
Celestial, lying on the other side,
Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost.</p>
<p>I saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars,
Still clad in armour round about their father,
Gaze at the scattered members of the giants.</p>
<p>I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod,
As if bewildered, looking at the people
Who had been proud with him in Sennaar.</p>
<p>O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes
Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced,
Between thy seven and seven children slain!</p>
<p>O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword
Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa,
That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew!</p>
<p>O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld
E&#x27;en then half spider, sad upon the shreds
Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee!</p>
<p>O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten
Thine image there; but full of consternation
A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!</p>
<p>Displayed moreo&#x27;er the adamantine pavement
How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon
Costly appear the luckless ornament;</p>
<p>Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves
Upon Sennacherib within the temple,
And how, he being dead, they left him there;</p>
<p>Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage
That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,
&quot;Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!&quot;</p>
<p>Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians
After that Holofernes had been slain,
And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.</p>
<p>I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns;
O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased,
Displayed the image that is there discerned!</p>
<p>Whoe&#x27;er of pencil master was or stile,
That could portray the shades and traits which there
Would cause each subtile genius to admire?</p>
<p>Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive;
Better than I saw not who saw the truth,
All that I trod upon while bowed I went.</p>
<p>Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,
Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces
So that ye may behold your evil ways!</p>
<p>More of the mount by us was now encompassed,
And far more spent the circuit of the sun,
Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,</p>
<p>When he, who ever watchful in advance
Was going on, began: &quot;Lift up thy head,
&#x27;Tis no more time to go thus meditating.</p>
<p>Lo there an Angel who is making haste
To come towards us; lo, returning is
From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.</p>
<p>With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,
So that he may delight to speed us upward;
Think that this day will never dawn again.&quot;</p>
<p>I was familiar with his admonition
Ever to lose no time; so on this theme
He could not unto me speak covertly.</p>
<p>Towards us came the being beautiful
Vested in white, and in his countenance
Such as appears the tremulous morning star.</p>
<p>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;
&quot;Come,&quot; said he, &quot;near at hand here are the steps,
And easy from henceforth is the ascent.&quot;</p>
<p>At this announcement few are they who come!
O human creatures, born to soar aloft,
Why fall ye thus before a little wind?</p>
<p>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;
There smote upon my forehead with his wings,
Then a safe passage promised unto me.</p>
<p>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount
Where seated is the church that lordeth it
O&#x27;er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,</p>
<p>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken
By stairways that were made there in the age
When still were safe the ledger and the stave,</p>
<p>E&#x27;en thus attempered is the bank which falls
Sheer downward from the second circle there;
But on this, side and that the high rock graze.</p>
<p>As we were turning thitherward our persons,
&quot;Beati pauperes spiritu,&quot; voices
Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.</p>
<p>Ah me! how different are these entrances
From the Infernal! for with anthems here
One enters, and below with wild laments.</p>
<p>We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,
And it appeared to me by far more easy
Than on the plain it had appeared before.</p>
<p>Whence I: &quot;My Master, say, what heavy thing
Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly
Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?&quot;</p>
<p>He answered: &quot;When the P&#x27;s which have remained
Still on thy face almost obliterate
Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,</p>
<p>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,
That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,
But urging up will be to them delight.&quot;</p>
<p>Then did I even as they do who are going
With something on the head to them unknown,
Unless the signs of others make them doubt,</p>
<p>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,
And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office
Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;</p>
<p>And with the fingers of the right hand spread
I found but six the letters, that had carved
Upon my temples he who bore the keys;</p>
<p>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XIII</p>
<p>We were upon the summit of the stairs,
Where for the second time is cut away
The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.</p>
<p>There in like manner doth a cornice bind
The hill all round about, as does the first,
Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.</p>
<p>Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;
So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,
With but the livid colour of the stone.</p>
<p>&quot;If to inquire we wait for people here,&quot;
The Poet said, &quot;I fear that peradventure
Too much delay will our election have.&quot;</p>
<p>Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,
Made his right side the centre of his motion,
And turned the left part of himself about.</p>
<p>&quot;O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter
Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,&quot;
Said he, &quot;as one within here should be led.</p>
<p>Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;
If other reason prompt not otherwise,
Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!&quot;</p>
<p>As much as here is counted for a mile,
So much already there had we advanced
In little time, by dint of ready will;</p>
<p>And tow&#x27;rds us there were heard to fly, albeit
They were not visible, spirits uttering
Unto Love&#x27;s table courteous invitations,</p>
<p>The first voice that passed onward in its flight,
&quot;Vinum non habent,&quot; said in accents loud,
And went reiterating it behind us.</p>
<p>And ere it wholly grew inaudible
Because of distance, passed another, crying,
&quot;I am Orestes!&quot; and it also stayed not.</p>
<p>&quot;O,&quot; said I, &quot;Father, these, what voices are they?&quot;
And even as I asked, behold the third,
Saying: &quot;Love those from whom ye have had evil!&quot;</p>
<p>And the good Master said: &quot;This circle scourges
The sin of envy, and on that account
Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.</p>
<p>The bridle of another sound shall be;
I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,
Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.</p>
<p>But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,
And people thou wilt see before us sitting,
And each one close against the cliff is seated.&quot;</p>
<p>Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;
I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles
Not from the colour of the stone diverse.</p>
<p>And when we were a little farther onward,
I heard a cry of, &quot;Mary, pray for us!&quot;
A cry of, &quot;Michael, Peter, and all Saints!&quot;</p>
<p>I do not think there walketh still on earth
A man so hard, that he would not be pierced
With pity at what afterward I saw.</p>
<p>For when I had approached so near to them
That manifest to me their acts became,
Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.</p>
<p>Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,
And one sustained the other with his shoulder,
And all of them were by the bank sustained.</p>
<p>Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,
Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,
And one upon another leans his head,</p>
<p>So that in others pity soon may rise,
Not only at the accent of their words,
But at their aspect, which no less implores.</p>
<p>And as unto the blind the sun comes not,
So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,
Heaven&#x27;s light will not be bounteous of itself;</p>
<p>For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,
And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild
Is done, because it will not quiet stay.</p>
<p>To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,
Seeing the others without being seen;
Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.</p>
<p>Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,
And therefore waited not for my demand,
But said: &quot;Speak, and be brief, and to the point.&quot;</p>
<p>I had Virgilius upon that side
Of the embankment from which one may fall,
Since by no border &#x27;tis engarlanded;</p>
<p>Upon the other side of me I had
The shades devout, who through the horrible seam
Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.</p>
<p>To them I turned me, and, &quot;O people, certain,&quot;
Began I, &quot;of beholding the high light,
Which your desire has solely in its care,</p>
<p>So may grace speedily dissolve the scum
Upon your consciences, that limpidly
Through them descend the river of the mind,</p>
<p>Tell me, for dear &#x27;twill be to me and gracious,
If any soul among you here is Latian,
And &#x27;twill perchance be good for him I learn it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O brother mine, each one is citizen
Of one true city; but thy meaning is,
Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.&quot;</p>
<p>By way of answer this I seemed to hear
A little farther on than where I stood,
Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.</p>
<p>Among the rest I saw a shade that waited
In aspect, and should any one ask how,
Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.</p>
<p>&quot;Spirit,&quot; I said, &quot;who stoopest to ascend,
If thou art he who did reply to me,
Make thyself known to me by place or name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sienese was I,&quot; it replied, &quot;and with
The others here recleanse my guilty life,
Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.</p>
<p>Sapient I was not, although I Sapia
Was called, and I was at another&#x27;s harm
More happy far than at my own good fortune.</p>
<p>And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,
Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.
The arc already of my years descending,</p>
<p>My fellow-citizens near unto Colle
Were joined in battle with their adversaries,
And I was praying God for what he willed.</p>
<p>Routed were they, and turned into the bitter
Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,
A joy received unequalled by all others;</p>
<p>So that I lifted upward my bold face
Crying to God, &#x27;Henceforth I fear thee not,&#x27;
As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.</p>
<p>Peace I desired with God at the extreme
Of my existence, and as yet would not
My debt have been by penitence discharged,</p>
<p>Had it not been that in remembrance held me
Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,
Who out of charity was grieved for me.</p>
<p>But who art thou, that into our conditions
Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound
As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mine eyes,&quot; I said, &quot;will yet be here ta&#x27;en from me,
But for short space; for small is the offence
Committed by their being turned with envy.</p>
<p>Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended
My soul is, of the torment underneath,
For even now the load down there weighs on me.&quot;</p>
<p>And she to me: &quot;Who led thee, then, among us
Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?&quot;
And I: &quot;He who is with me, and speaks not;</p>
<p>And living am I; therefore ask of me,
Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move
O&#x27;er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O, this is such a novel thing to hear,&quot;
She answered, &quot;that great sign it is God loves thee;
Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.</p>
<p>And I implore, by what thou most desirest,
If e&#x27;er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany,
Well with my kindred reinstate my fame.</p>
<p>Them wilt thou see among that people vain
Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there
More hope than in discovering the Diana;</p>
<p>But there still more the admirals will lose.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XIV</p>
<p>&quot;Who is this one that goes about our mountain,
Or ever Death has given him power of flight,
And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know not who, but know he&#x27;s not alone;
Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,
And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus did two spirits, leaning tow&#x27;rds each other,
Discourse about me there on the right hand;
Then held supine their faces to address me.</p>
<p>And said the one: &quot;O soul, that, fastened still
Within the body, tow&#x27;rds the heaven art going,
For charity console us, and declare</p>
<p>Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak&#x27;st us
As much to marvel at this grace of thine
As must a thing that never yet has been.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;Through midst of Tuscany there wanders
A streamlet that is born in Falterona,
And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;</p>
<p>From thereupon do I this body bring.
To tell you who I am were speech in vain,
Because my name as yet makes no great noise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If well thy meaning I can penetrate
With intellect of mine,&quot; then answered me
He who first spake, &quot;thou speakest of the Arno.&quot;</p>
<p>And said the other to him: &quot;Why concealed
This one the appellation of that river,
Even as a man doth of things horrible?&quot;</p>
<p>And thus the shade that questioned was of this
Himself acquitted: &quot;I know not; but truly
&#x27;Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;</p>
<p>For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant
The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro
That in few places it that mark surpasses)</p>
<p>To where it yields itself in restoration
Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,
Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,</p>
<p>Virtue is like an enemy avoided
By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune
Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;</p>
<p>On which account have so transformed their nature
The dwellers in that miserable valley,
It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.</p>
<p>&#x27;Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier
Than other food for human use created,
It first directeth its impoverished way.</p>
<p>Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,
More snarling than their puissance demands,
And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.</p>
<p>It goes on falling, and the more it grows,
The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,
This maledict and misadventurous ditch.</p>
<p>Descended then through many a hollow gulf,
It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,
They fear no cunning that may master them.</p>
<p>Nor will I cease because another hears me;
And well &#x27;twill be for him, if still he mind him
Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.</p>
<p>Thy grandson I behold, who doth become
A hunter of those wolves upon the bank
Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.</p>
<p>He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;
Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;
Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.</p>
<p>Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;
He leaves it such, a thousand years from now
In its primeval state &#x27;tis not re-wooded.&quot;</p>
<p>As at the announcement of impending ills
The face of him who listens is disturbed,
From whate&#x27;er side the peril seize upon him;</p>
<p>So I beheld that other soul, which stood
Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,
When it had gathered to itself the word.</p>
<p>The speech of one and aspect of the other
Had me desirous made to know their names,
And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,</p>
<p>Whereat the spirit which first spake to me
Began again: &quot;Thou wishest I should bring me
To do for thee what thou&#x27;lt not do for me;</p>
<p>But since God willeth that in thee shine forth
Such grace of his, I&#x27;ll not be chary with thee;
Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.</p>
<p>My blood was so with envy set on fire,
That if I had beheld a man make merry,
Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o&#x27;er with pallor.</p>
<p>From my own sowing such the straw I reap!
O human race! why dost thou set thy heart
Where interdict of partnership must be?</p>
<p>This is Renier; this is the boast and honour
Of the house of Calboli, where no one since
Has made himself the heir of his desert.</p>
<p>And not alone his blood is made devoid,
&#x27;Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno,
Of good required for truth and for diversion;</p>
<p>For all within these boundaries is full
Of venomous roots, so that too tardily
By cultivation now would they diminish.</p>
<p>Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,
Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,
O Romagnuoli into bastards turned?</p>
<p>When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise?
When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco,
The noble scion of ignoble seed?</p>
<p>Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,
When I remember, with Guido da Prata,
Ugolin d&#x27; Azzo, who was living with us,</p>
<p>Frederick Tignoso and his company,
The house of Traversara, and th&#x27; Anastagi,
And one race and the other is extinct;</p>
<p>The dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease
That filled our souls with love and courtesy,
There where the hearts have so malicious grown!</p>
<p>O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,
Seeing that all thy family is gone,
And many people, not to be corrupted?</p>
<p>Bagnacaval does well in not begetting
And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,
In taking trouble to beget such Counts.</p>
<p>Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil
Shall have departed; but not therefore pure
Will testimony of them e&#x27;er remain.</p>
<p>O Ugolin de&#x27; Fantoli, secure
Thy name is, since no longer is awaited
One who, degenerating, can obscure it!</p>
<p>But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me
To weep far better than it does to speak,
So much has our discourse my mind distressed.&quot;</p>
<p>We were aware that those beloved souls
Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,
They made us of our pathway confident.</p>
<p>When we became alone by going onward,
Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared
A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&quot;Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!&quot;
And fled as the reverberation dies
If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.</p>
<p>As soon as hearing had a truce from this,
Behold another, with so great a crash,
That it resembled thunderings following fast:</p>
<p>&quot;I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!&quot;
And then, to press myself close to the Poet,
I backward, and not forward, took a step.</p>
<p>Already on all sides the air was quiet;
And said he to me: &quot;That was the hard curb
That ought to hold a man within his bounds;</p>
<p>But you take in the bait so that the hook
Of the old Adversary draws you to him,
And hence availeth little curb or call.</p>
<p>The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,
Displaying to you their eternal beauties,
And still your eye is looking on the ground;</p>
<p>Whence He, who all discerns, chastises you.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XV</p>
<p>As much as &#x27;twixt the close of the third hour
And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere
Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,</p>
<p>So much it now appeared, towards the night,
Was of his course remaining to the sun;
There it was evening, and &#x27;twas midnight here;</p>
<p>And the rays smote the middle of our faces,
Because by us the mount was so encircled,
That straight towards the west we now were going</p>
<p>When I perceived my forehead overpowered
Beneath the splendour far more than at first,
And stupor were to me the things unknown,</p>
<p>Whereat towards the summit of my brow
I raised my hands, and made myself the visor
Which the excessive glare diminishes.</p>
<p>As when from off the water, or a mirror,
The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,
Ascending upward in the selfsame measure</p>
<p>That it descends, and deviates as far
From falling of a stone in line direct,
(As demonstrate experiment and art,)</p>
<p>So it appeared to me that by a light
Refracted there before me I was smitten;
On which account my sight was swift to flee.</p>
<p>&quot;What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot
So fully screen my sight that it avail me,&quot;
Said I, &quot;and seems towards us to be moving?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet
The family of heaven,&quot; he answered me;
&quot;An angel &#x27;tis, who comes to invite us upward.</p>
<p>Soon will it be, that to behold these things
Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee
As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.&quot;</p>
<p>When we had reached the Angel benedight,
With joyful voice he said: &quot;Here enter in
To stairway far less steep than are the others.&quot;</p>
<p>We mounting were, already thence departed,
And &quot;Beati misericordes&quot; was
Behind us sung, &quot;Rejoice, thou that o&#x27;ercomest!&quot;</p>
<p>My Master and myself, we two alone
Were going upward, and I thought, in going,
Some profit to acquire from words of his;</p>
<p>And I to him directed me, thus asking:
&quot;What did the spirit of Romagna mean,
Mentioning interdict and partnership?&quot;</p>
<p>Whence he to me: &quot;Of his own greatest failing
He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not
If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.</p>
<p>Because are thither pointed your desires
Where by companionship each share is lessened,
Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.</p>
<p>But if the love of the supernal sphere
Should upwardly direct your aspiration,
There would not be that fear within your breast;</p>
<p>For there, as much the more as one says &#x27;Our,&#x27;
So much the more of good each one possesses,
And more of charity in that cloister burns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am more hungering to be satisfied,&quot;
I said, &quot;than if I had before been silent,
And more of doubt within my mind I gather.</p>
<p>How can it be, that boon distributed
The more possessors can more wealthy make
Therein, than if by few it be possessed?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Because thou fixest still
Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,
Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.</p>
<p>That goodness infinite and ineffable
Which is above there, runneth unto love,
As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.</p>
<p>So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,
So that as far as charity extends,
O&#x27;er it increases the eternal valour.</p>
<p>And the more people thitherward aspire,
More are there to love well, and more they love there,
And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.</p>
<p>And if my reasoning appease thee not,
Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully
Take from thee this and every other longing.</p>
<p>Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,
As are the two already, the five wounds
That close themselves again by being painful.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as I wished to say, &quot;Thou dost appease me,&quot;
I saw that I had reached another circle,
So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.</p>
<p>There it appeared to me that in a vision
Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,
And in a temple many persons saw;</p>
<p>And at the door a woman, with the sweet
Behaviour of a mother, saying: &quot;Son,
Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?</p>
<p>Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself
Were seeking for thee;&quot;--and as here she ceased,
That which appeared at first had disappeared.</p>
<p>Then I beheld another with those waters
Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever
From great disdain of others it is born,</p>
<p>And saying: &quot;If of that city thou art lord,
For whose name was such strife among the gods,
And whence doth every science scintillate,</p>
<p>Avenge thyself on those audacious arms
That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;&quot;
And the lord seemed to me benign and mild</p>
<p>To answer her with aspect temperate:
&quot;What shall we do to those who wish us ill,
If he who loves us be by us condemned?&quot;</p>
<p>Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,
With stones a young man slaying, clamorously
Still crying to each other, &quot;Kill him! kill him!&quot;</p>
<p>And him I saw bow down, because of death
That weighed already on him, to the earth,
But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,</p>
<p>Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,
That he would pardon those his persecutors,
With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.</p>
<p>Soon as my soul had outwardly returned
To things external to it which are true,
Did I my not false errors recognize.</p>
<p>My Leader, who could see me bear myself
Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,
Exclaimed: &quot;What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?</p>
<p>But hast been coming more than half a league
Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,
In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,
I&#x27;ll tell thee,&quot; said I, &quot;what appeared to me,
When thus from me my legs were ta&#x27;en away.&quot;</p>
<p>And he: &quot;If thou shouldst have a hundred masks
Upon thy face, from me would not be shut
Thy cogitations, howsoever small.</p>
<p>What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail
To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,
Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.</p>
<p>I did not ask, &#x27;What ails thee?&#x27; as he does
Who only looketh with the eyes that see not
When of the soul bereft the body lies,</p>
<p>But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;
Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow
To use their wakefulness when it returns.&quot;</p>
<p>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering
Forward as far as ever eye could stretch
Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;</p>
<p>And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached
In our direction, sombre as the night,
Nor was there place to hide one&#x27;s self therefrom.</p>
<p>This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XVI</p>
<p>Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived
Of every planet under a poor sky,
As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,</p>
<p>Ne&#x27;er made unto my sight so thick a veil,
As did that smoke which there enveloped us,
Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;</p>
<p>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;
Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,
Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.</p>
<p>E&#x27;en as a blind man goes behind his guide,
Lest he should wander, or should strike against
Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,</p>
<p>So went I through the bitter and foul air,
Listening unto my Leader, who said only,
&quot;Look that from me thou be not separated.&quot;</p>
<p>Voices I heard, and every one appeared
To supplicate for peace and misericord
The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.</p>
<p>Still &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; their exordium was;
One word there was in all, and metre one,
So that all harmony appeared among them.</p>
<p>&quot;Master,&quot; I said, &quot;are spirits those I hear?&quot;
And he to me: &quot;Thou apprehendest truly,
And they the knot of anger go unloosing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke
And art discoursing of us even as though
Thou didst by calends still divide the time?&quot;</p>
<p>After this manner by a voice was spoken;
Whereon my Master said: &quot;Do thou reply,
And ask if on this side the way go upward.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;O creature that dost cleanse thyself
To return beautiful to Him who made thee,
Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,&quot;
He answered; &quot;and if smoke prevent our seeing,
Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.&quot;</p>
<p>Thereon began I: &quot;With that swathing band
Which death unwindeth am I going upward,
And hither came I through the infernal anguish.</p>
<p>And if God in his grace has me infolded,
So that he wills that I behold his court
By method wholly out of modern usage,</p>
<p>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,
But tell it me, and tell me if I go
Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;
The world I knew, and loved that excellence,
At which has each one now unbent his bow.</p>
<p>For mounting upward, thou art going right.&quot;
Thus he made answer, and subjoined: &quot;I pray thee
To pray for me when thou shalt be above.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;My faith I pledge to thee
To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting
Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.</p>
<p>First it was simple, and is now made double
By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,
Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.</p>
<p>The world forsooth is utterly deserted
By every virtue, as thou tellest me,
And with iniquity is big and covered;</p>
<p>But I beseech thee point me out the cause,
That I may see it, and to others show it;
For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.&quot;</p>
<p>A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!
He first sent forth, and then began he: &quot;Brother,
The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!</p>
<p>Ye who are living every cause refer
Still upward to the heavens, as if all things
They of necessity moved with themselves.</p>
<p>If this were so, in you would be destroyed
Free will, nor any justice would there be
In having joy for good, or grief for evil.</p>
<p>The heavens your movements do initiate,
I say not all; but granting that I say it,
Light has been given you for good and evil,</p>
<p>And free volition; which, if some fatigue
In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,
Afterwards conquers all, if well &#x27;tis nurtured.</p>
<p>To greater force and to a better nature,
Though free, ye subject are, and that creates
The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.</p>
<p>Hence, if the present world doth go astray,
In you the cause is, be it sought in you;
And I therein will now be thy true spy.</p>
<p>Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it
Before it is, like to a little girl
Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,</p>
<p>Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,
Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,
Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.</p>
<p>Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;
Is cheated by it, and runs after it,
If guide or rein turn not aside its love.</p>
<p>Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,
Behoved a king to have, who at the least
Of the true city should discern the tower.</p>
<p>The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?
No one; because the shepherd who precedes
Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;</p>
<p>Wherefore the people that perceives its guide
Strike only at the good for which it hankers,
Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.</p>
<p>Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance
The cause is that has made the world depraved,
And not that nature is corrupt in you.</p>
<p>Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was
Two suns to have, which one road and the other,
Of God and of the world, made manifest.</p>
<p>One has the other quenched, and to the crosier
The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it
That by main force one with the other go,</p>
<p>Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;
If thou believe not, think upon the grain,
For by its seed each herb is recognized.</p>
<p>In the land laved by Po and Adige,
Valour and courtesy used to be found,
Before that Frederick had his controversy;</p>
<p>Now in security can pass that way
Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,
From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.</p>
<p>True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids
The ancient age the new, and late they deem it
That God restore them to the better life:</p>
<p>Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,
And Guido da Castel, who better named is,
In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:</p>
<p>Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,
Confounding in itself two governments,
Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O Marco mine,&quot; I said, &quot;thou reasonest well;
And now discern I why the sons of Levi
Have been excluded from the heritage.</p>
<p>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample
Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained
In reprobation of the barbarous age?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,&quot;
He answered me; &quot;for speaking Tuscan to me,
It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.</p>
<p>By other surname do I know him not,
Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.
May God be with you, for I come no farther.</p>
<p>Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,
Already whitening; and I must depart--
Yonder the Angel is--ere he appear.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XVII</p>
<p>Remember, Reader, if e&#x27;er in the Alps
A mist o&#x27;ertook thee, through which thou couldst see
Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,</p>
<p>How, when the vapours humid and condensed
Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere
Of the sun feebly enters in among them,</p>
<p>And thy imagination will be swift
In coming to perceive how I re-saw
The sun at first, that was already setting.</p>
<p>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master
Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud
To rays already dead on the low shores.</p>
<p>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us
So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,
Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,</p>
<p>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?
Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,
By self, or by a will that downward guides it.</p>
<p>Of her impiety, who changed her form
Into the bird that most delights in singing,
In my imagining appeared the trace;</p>
<p>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn
Within itself, that from without there came
Nothing that then might be received by it.</p>
<p>Then reigned within my lofty fantasy
One crucified, disdainful and ferocious
In countenance, and even thus was dying.</p>
<p>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,
Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,
Who was in word and action so entire.</p>
<p>And even as this image burst asunder
Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble
In which the water it was made of fails,</p>
<p>There rose up in my vision a young maiden
Bitterly weeping, and she said: &quot;O queen,
Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?</p>
<p>Thou&#x27;st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;
Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,
Mother, at thine ere at another&#x27;s ruin.&quot;</p>
<p>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden
New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,
And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,</p>
<p>So this imagining of mine fell down
As soon as the effulgence smote my face,
Greater by far than what is in our wont.</p>
<p>I turned me round to see where I might be,
When said a voice, &quot;Here is the passage up;&quot;
Which from all other purposes removed me,</p>
<p>And made my wish so full of eagerness
To look and see who was it that was speaking,
It never rests till meeting face to face;</p>
<p>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,
And in its own excess its figure veils,
Even so my power was insufficient here.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a spirit divine, who in the way
Of going up directs us without asking,
And who with his own light himself conceals.</p>
<p>He does with us as man doth with himself;
For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,
Malignly leans already tow&#x27;rds denial.</p>
<p>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,
Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;
For then we could not till the day return.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he
Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;
And I, as soon as the first step I reached,</p>
<p>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,
And fanning in the face, and saying, &quot;&#x27;Beati
Pacifici,&#x27; who are without ill anger.&quot;</p>
<p>Already over us were so uplifted
The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,
That upon many sides the stars appeared.</p>
<p>&quot;O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?&quot;
I said within myself; for I perceived
The vigour of my legs was put in truce.</p>
<p>We at the point were where no more ascends
The stairway upward, and were motionless,
Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;</p>
<p>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear
Aught whatsoever in the circle new;
Then to my Master turned me round and said:</p>
<p>&quot;Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency
Is purged here in the circle where we are?
Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;The love of good, remiss
In what it should have done, is here restored;
Here plied again the ill-belated oar;</p>
<p>But still more openly to understand,
Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather
Some profitable fruit from our delay.</p>
<p>Neither Creator nor a creature ever,
Son,&quot; he began, &quot;was destitute of love
Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.</p>
<p>The natural was ever without error;
But err the other may by evil object,
Or by too much, or by too little vigour.</p>
<p>While in the first it well directed is,
And in the second moderates itself,
It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;</p>
<p>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care
Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,
&#x27;Gainst the Creator works his own creation.</p>
<p>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be
The seed within yourselves of every virtue,
And every act that merits punishment.</p>
<p>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare
Of its own subject can love turn its sight,
From their own hatred all things are secure;</p>
<p>And since we cannot think of any being
Standing alone, nor from the First divided,
Of hating Him is all desire cut off.</p>
<p>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,
The evil that one loves is of one&#x27;s neighbour,
And this is born in three modes in your clay.</p>
<p>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,
Hope to excel, and therefore only long
That from his greatness he may be cast down;</p>
<p>There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown
Fear they may lose because another rises,
Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;</p>
<p>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,
So that it makes them greedy for revenge,
And such must needs shape out another&#x27;s harm.</p>
<p>This threefold love is wept for down below;
Now of the other will I have thee hear,
That runneth after good with measure faulty.</p>
<p>Each one confusedly a good conceives
Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;
Therefore to overtake it each one strives.</p>
<p>If languid love to look on this attract you,
Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,
After just penitence, torments you for it.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s other good that does not make man happy;
&#x27;Tis not felicity, &#x27;tis not the good
Essence, of every good the fruit and root.</p>
<p>The love that yields itself too much to this
Above us is lamented in three circles;
But how tripartite it may be described,</p>
<p>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XVIII</p>
<p>An end had put unto his reasoning
The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking
Into my face, if I appeared content;</p>
<p>And I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,
Without was mute, and said within: &quot;Perchance
The too much questioning I make annoys him.&quot;</p>
<p>But that true Father, who had comprehended
The timid wish, that opened not itself,
By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.</p>
<p>Whence I: &quot;My sight is, Master, vivified
So in thy light, that clearly I discern
Whate&#x27;er thy speech importeth or describes.</p>
<p>Therefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,
To teach me love, to which thou dost refer
Every good action and its contrary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Direct,&quot; he said, &quot;towards me the keen eyes
Of intellect, and clear will be to thee
The error of the blind, who would be leaders.</p>
<p>The soul, which is created apt to love,
Is mobile unto everything that pleases,
Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.</p>
<p>Your apprehension from some real thing
An image draws, and in yourselves displays it
So that it makes the soul turn unto it.</p>
<p>And if, when turned, towards it she incline,
Love is that inclination; it is nature,
Which is by pleasure bound in you anew</p>
<p>Then even as the fire doth upward move
By its own form, which to ascend is born,
Where longest in its matter it endures,</p>
<p>So comes the captive soul into desire,
Which is a motion spiritual, and ne&#x27;er rests
Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.</p>
<p>Now may apparent be to thee how hidden
The truth is from those people, who aver
All love is in itself a laudable thing;</p>
<p>Because its matter may perchance appear
Aye to be good; but yet not each impression
Is good, albeit good may be the wax.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,&quot;
I answered him, &quot;have love revealed to me;
But that has made me more impregned with doubt;</p>
<p>For if love from without be offered us,
And with another foot the soul go not,
If right or wrong she go, &#x27;tis not her merit.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;What reason seeth here,
Myself can tell thee; beyond that await
For Beatrice, since &#x27;tis a work of faith.</p>
<p>Every substantial form, that segregate
From matter is, and with it is united,
Specific power has in itself collected,</p>
<p>Which without act is not perceptible,
Nor shows itself except by its effect,
As life does in a plant by the green leaves.</p>
<p>But still, whence cometh the intelligence
Of the first notions, man is ignorant,
And the affection for the first allurements,</p>
<p>Which are in you as instinct in the bee
To make its honey; and this first desire
Merit of praise or blame containeth not.</p>
<p>Now, that to this all others may be gathered,
Innate within you is the power that counsels,
And it should keep the threshold of assent.</p>
<p>This is the principle, from which is taken
Occasion of desert in you, according
As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows.</p>
<p>Those who, in reasoning, to the bottom went,
Were of this innate liberty aware,
Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world.</p>
<p>Supposing, then, that from necessity
Springs every love that is within you kindled,
Within yourselves the power is to restrain it.</p>
<p>The noble virtue Beatrice understands
By the free will; and therefore see that thou
Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it.&quot;</p>
<p>The moon, belated almost unto midnight,
Now made the stars appear to us more rare,
Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze,</p>
<p>And counter to the heavens ran through those paths
Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome
Sees it &#x27;twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;</p>
<p>And that patrician shade, for whom is named
Pietola more than any Mantuan town,
Had laid aside the burden of my lading;</p>
<p>Whence I, who reason manifest and plain
In answer to my questions had received,
Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.</p>
<p>But taken from me was this drowsiness
Suddenly by a people, that behind
Our backs already had come round to us.</p>
<p>And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus
Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,
If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,</p>
<p>So they along that circle curve their step,
From what I saw of those approaching us,
Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.</p>
<p>Full soon they were upon us, because running
Moved onward all that mighty multitude,
And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,</p>
<p>&quot;Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,
And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,
Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost
By little love!&quot; forthwith the others cried,
&quot;For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O folk, in whom an eager fervour now
Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,
Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,</p>
<p>This one who lives, and truly I lie not,
Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;
So tell us where the passage nearest is.&quot;</p>
<p>These were the words of him who was my Guide;
And some one of those spirits said: &quot;Come on
Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;</p>
<p>So full of longing are we to move onward,
That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,
If thou for churlishness our justice take.</p>
<p>I was San Zeno&#x27;s Abbot at Verona,
Under the empire of good Barbarossa,
Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;</p>
<p>And he has one foot in the grave already,
Who shall erelong lament that monastery,
And sorry be of having there had power,</p>
<p>Because his son, in his whole body sick,
And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,
He put into the place of its true pastor.&quot;</p>
<p>If more he said, or silent was, I know not,
He had already passed so far beyond us;
But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.</p>
<p>And he who was in every need my succour
Said: &quot;Turn thee hitherward; see two of them
Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.&quot;</p>
<p>In rear of all they shouted: &quot;Sooner were
The people dead to whom the sea was opened,
Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;</p>
<p>And those who the fatigue did not endure
Unto the issue, with Anchises&#x27; son,
Themselves to life withouten glory offered.&quot;</p>
<p>Then when from us so separated were
Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,
Within me a new thought did entrance find,</p>
<p>Whence others many and diverse were born;
And so I lapsed from one into another,
That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,</p>
<p>And meditation into dream transmuted.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XIX</p>
<p>It was the hour when the diurnal heat
No more can warm the coldness of the moon,
Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn,</p>
<p>When geomancers their Fortuna Major
See in the orient before the dawn
Rise by a path that long remains not dim,</p>
<p>There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,
Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,
With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.</p>
<p>I looked at her; and as the sun restores
The frigid members which the night benumbs,
Even thus my gaze did render voluble</p>
<p>Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter
In little while, and the lost countenance
As love desires it so in her did colour.</p>
<p>When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,
She &#x27;gan to sing so, that with difficulty
Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.</p>
<p>&quot;I am,&quot; she sang, &quot;I am the Siren sweet
Who mariners amid the main unman,
So full am I of pleasantness to hear.</p>
<p>I drew Ulysses from his wandering way
Unto my song, and he who dwells with me
Seldom departs so wholly I content him.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mouth was not yet closed again, before
Appeared a Lady saintly and alert
Close at my side to put her to confusion.</p>
<p>&quot;Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?&quot;
Sternly she said; and he was drawing near
With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.</p>
<p>She seized the other and in front laid open,
Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;
This waked me with the stench that issued from it.</p>
<p>I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:
&quot;At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;
Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.&quot;</p>
<p>I rose; and full already of high day
Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,
And with the new sun at our back we went.</p>
<p>Following behind him, I my forehead bore
Like unto one who has it laden with thought,
Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,</p>
<p>When I heard say, &quot;Come, here the passage is,&quot;
Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,
Such as we hear not in this mortal region.</p>
<p>With open wings, which of a swan appeared,
Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,
Between the two walls of the solid granite.</p>
<p>He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,
Affirming those &#x27;qui lugent&#x27; to be blessed,
For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.</p>
<p>&quot;What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?&quot;
To me my Guide began to say, we both
Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.</p>
<p>And I: &quot;With such misgiving makes me go
A vision new, which bends me to itself,
So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didst thou behold,&quot; he said, &quot;that old enchantress,
Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?
Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?</p>
<p>Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,
Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls
The Eternal King with revolutions vast.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,
Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,
Through the desire of food that draws him thither,</p>
<p>Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves
The rock to give a way to him who mounts,
Went on to where the circling doth begin.</p>
<p>On the fifth circle when I had come forth,
People I saw upon it who were weeping,
Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.</p>
<p>&quot;Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,&quot;
I heard them say with sighings so profound,
That hardly could the words be understood.</p>
<p>&quot;O ye elect of God, whose sufferings
Justice and Hope both render less severe,
Direct ye us towards the high ascents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If ye are come secure from this prostration,
And wish to find the way most speedily,
Let your right hands be evermore outside.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered
By them somewhat in front of us; whence I
In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,</p>
<p>And unto my Lord&#x27;s eyes mine eyes I turned;
Whence he assented with a cheerful sign
To what the sight of my desire implored.</p>
<p>When of myself I could dispose at will,
Above that creature did I draw myself,
Whose words before had caused me to take note,</p>
<p>Saying: &quot;O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens
That without which to God we cannot turn,
Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.</p>
<p>Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,
Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee
Anything there whence living I departed.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Wherefore our backs the heaven
Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand
&#x27;Scias quod ego fui successor Petri.&#x27;</p>
<p>Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends
A river beautiful, and of its name
The title of my blood its summit makes.</p>
<p>A month and little more essayed I how
Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it,
For all the other burdens seem a feather.</p>
<p>Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;
But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,
Then I discovered life to be a lie.</p>
<p>I saw that there the heart was not at rest,
Nor farther in that life could one ascend;
Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.</p>
<p>Until that time a wretched soul and parted
From God was I, and wholly avaricious;
Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.</p>
<p>What avarice does is here made manifest
In the purgation of these souls converted,
And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.</p>
<p>Even as our eye did not uplift itself
Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,
So justice here has merged it in the earth.</p>
<p>As avarice had extinguished our affection
For every good, whereby was action lost,
So justice here doth hold us in restraint,</p>
<p>Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;
And so long as it pleases the just Lord
Shall we remain immovable and prostrate.&quot;</p>
<p>I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;
But even as I began, and he was &#x27;ware,
Only by listening, of my reverence,</p>
<p>&quot;What cause,&quot; he said, &quot;has downward bent thee thus?&quot;
And I to him: &quot;For your own dignity,
Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,&quot;
He answered: &quot;Err not, fellow-servant am I
With thee and with the others to one power.</p>
<p>If e&#x27;er that holy, evangelic sound,
Which sayeth &#x27;neque nubent,&#x27; thou hast heard,
Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak.</p>
<p>Now go; no longer will I have thee linger,
Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping,
With which I ripen that which thou hast said.</p>
<p>On earth I have a grandchild named Alagia,
Good in herself, unless indeed our house
Malevolent may make her by example,</p>
<p>And she alone remains to me on earth.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XX</p>
<p>Ill strives the will against a better will;
Therefore, to pleasure him, against my pleasure
I drew the sponge not saturate from the water.</p>
<p>Onward I moved, and onward moved my Leader,
Through vacant places, skirting still the rock,
As on a wall close to the battlements;</p>
<p>For they that through their eyes pour drop by drop
The malady which all the world pervades,
On the other side too near the verge approach.</p>
<p>Accursed mayst thou be, thou old she-wolf,
That more than all the other beasts hast prey,
Because of hunger infinitely hollow!</p>
<p>O heaven, in whose gyrations some appear
To think conditions here below are changed,
When will he come through whom she shall depart?</p>
<p>Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce,
And I attentive to the shades I heard
Piteously weeping and bemoaning them;</p>
<p>And I by peradventure heard &quot;Sweet Mary!&quot;
Uttered in front of us amid the weeping
Even as a woman does who is in child-birth;</p>
<p>And in continuance: &quot;How poor thou wast
Is manifested by that hostelry
Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.&quot;</p>
<p>Thereafterward I heard: &quot;O good Fabricius,
Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer
To the possession of great wealth with vice.&quot;</p>
<p>So pleasurable were these words to me
That I drew farther onward to have knowledge
Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come.</p>
<p>He furthermore was speaking of the largess
Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave,
In order to conduct their youth to honour.</p>
<p>&quot;O soul that dost so excellently speak,
Tell me who wast thou,&quot; said I, &quot;and why only
Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?</p>
<p>Not without recompense shall be thy word,
If I return to finish the short journey
Of that life which is flying to its end.&quot;</p>
<p>And he: &quot;I&#x27;ll tell thee, not for any comfort
I may expect from earth, but that so much
Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead.</p>
<p>I was the root of that malignant plant
Which overshadows all the Christian world,
So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it;</p>
<p>But if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges
Had Power, soon vengeance would be taken on it;
And this I pray of Him who judges all.</p>
<p>Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth;
From me were born the Louises and Philips,
By whom in later days has France been governed.</p>
<p>I was the son of a Parisian butcher,
What time the ancient kings had perished all,
Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.</p>
<p>I found me grasping in my hands the rein
Of the realm&#x27;s government, and so great power
Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,</p>
<p>That to the widowed diadem promoted
The head of mine own offspring was, from whom
The consecrated bones of these began.</p>
<p>So long as the great dowry of Provence
Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,
&#x27;Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.</p>
<p>Then it began with falsehood and with force
Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,
Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.</p>
<p>Charles came to Italy, and for amends
A victim made of Conradin, and then
Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.</p>
<p>A time I see, not very distant now,
Which draweth forth another Charles from France,
The better to make known both him and his.</p>
<p>Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance
That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts
So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.</p>
<p>He thence not land, but sin and infamy,
Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself
As the more light such damage he accounts.</p>
<p>The other, now gone forth, ta&#x27;en in his ship,
See I his daughter sell, and chaffer for her
As corsairs do with other female slaves.</p>
<p>What more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us,
Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn,
It careth not for its own proper flesh?</p>
<p>That less may seem the future ill and past,
I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter,
And Christ in his own Vicar captive made.</p>
<p>I see him yet another time derided;
I see renewed the vinegar and gall,
And between living thieves I see him slain.</p>
<p>I see the modern Pilate so relentless,
This does not sate him, but without decretal
He to the temple bears his sordid sails!</p>
<p>When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made
By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,
Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?</p>
<p>What I was saying of that only bride
Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee
To turn towards me for some commentary,</p>
<p>So long has been ordained to all our prayers
As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,
Contrary sound we take instead thereof.</p>
<p>At that time we repeat Pygmalion,
Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide
Made his insatiable desire of gold;</p>
<p>And the misery of avaricious Midas,
That followed his inordinate demand,
At which forevermore one needs but laugh.</p>
<p>The foolish Achan each one then records,
And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath
Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.</p>
<p>Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband,
We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,
And the whole mount in infamy encircles</p>
<p>Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus.
Here finally is cried: &#x27;O Crassus, tell us,
For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?&#x27;</p>
<p>Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low,
According to desire of speech, that spurs us
To greater now and now to lesser pace.</p>
<p>But in the good that here by day is talked of,
Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by
No other person lifted up his voice.&quot;</p>
<p>From him already we departed were,
And made endeavour to o&#x27;ercome the road
As much as was permitted to our power,</p>
<p>When I perceived, like something that is falling,
The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,
As seizes him who to his death is going.</p>
<p>Certes so violently shook not Delos,
Before Latona made her nest therein
To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.</p>
<p>Then upon all sides there began a cry,
Such that the Master drew himself towards me,
Saying, &quot;Fear not, while I am guiding thee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo,&quot; all
Were saying, from what near I comprehended,
Where it was possible to hear the cry.</p>
<p>We paused immovable and in suspense,
Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,
Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.</p>
<p>Then we resumed again our holy path,
Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,
Already turned to their accustomed plaint.</p>
<p>No ignorance ever with so great a strife
Had rendered me importunate to know,
If erreth not in this my memory,</p>
<p>As meditating then I seemed to have;
Nor out of haste to question did I dare,
Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;</p>
<p>So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXI</p>
<p>The natural thirst, that ne&#x27;er is satisfied
Excepting with the water for whose grace
The woman of Samaria besought,</p>
<p>Put me in travail, and haste goaded me
Along the encumbered path behind my Leader
And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;</p>
<p>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth
That Christ appeared to two upon the way
From the sepulchral cave already risen,</p>
<p>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,
Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,
Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,</p>
<p>Saying, &quot;My brothers, may God give you peace!&quot;
We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered
To him the countersign thereto conforming.</p>
<p>Thereon began he: &quot;In the blessed council,
Thee may the court veracious place in peace,
That me doth banish in eternal exile!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How,&quot; said he, and the while we went with speed,
&quot;If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,
Who up his stairs so far has guided you?&quot;</p>
<p>And said my Teacher: &quot;If thou note the marks
Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces
Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.</p>
<p>But because she who spinneth day and night
For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,
Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,</p>
<p>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,
In coming upwards could not come alone,
By reason that it sees not in our fashion.</p>
<p>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat
Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him
As far on as my school has power to lead.</p>
<p>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder
Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together
All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?&quot;</p>
<p>In asking he so hit the very eye
Of my desire, that merely with the hope
My thirst became the less unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&quot;Naught is there,&quot; he began, &quot;that without order
May the religion of the mountain feel,
Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.</p>
<p>Free is it here from every permutation;
What from itself heaven in itself receiveth
Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;</p>
<p>Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,
Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls
Than the short, little stairway of three steps.</p>
<p>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,
Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,
That often upon earth her region shifts;</p>
<p>No arid vapour any farther rises
Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,
Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.</p>
<p>Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,
But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden
I know not how, up here it never trembled.</p>
<p>It trembles here, whenever any soul
Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves
To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.</p>
<p>Of purity the will alone gives proof,
Which, being wholly free to change its convent,
Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.</p>
<p>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,
Which divine justice with the self-same will
There was to sin, upon the torment sets.</p>
<p>And I, who have been lying in this pain
Five hundred years and more, but just now felt
A free volition for a better seat.</p>
<p>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious
Spirits along the mountain rendering praise
Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.&quot;</p>
<p>So said he to him; and since we enjoy
As much in drinking as the thirst is great,
I could not say how much it did me good.</p>
<p>And the wise Leader: &quot;Now I see the net
That snares you here, and how ye are set free,
Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.</p>
<p>Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;
And why so many centuries thou hast here
Been lying, let me gather from thy words.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In days when the good Titus, with the aid
Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds
Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,</p>
<p>Under the name that most endures and honours,
Was I on earth,&quot; that spirit made reply,
&quot;Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.</p>
<p>My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome
Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,
Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle.</p>
<p>Statius the people name me still on earth;
I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;
But on the way fell with my second burden.</p>
<p>The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks
Of that celestial flame which heated me,
Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;</p>
<p>Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me
A mother was, and was my nurse in song;
Without this weighed I not a drachma&#x27;s weight.</p>
<p>And to have lived upon the earth what time
Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun
More than I must ere issuing from my ban.&quot;</p>
<p>These words towards me made Virgilius turn
With looks that in their silence said, &quot;Be silent!&quot;
But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;</p>
<p>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants
Unto the passion from which each springs forth,
In the most truthful least the will they follow.</p>
<p>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;
Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed
Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;</p>
<p>And, &quot;As thou well mayst consummate a labour
So great,&quot; it said, &quot;why did thy face just now
Display to me the lightning of a smile?&quot;</p>
<p>Now am I caught on this side and on that;
One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,
Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.</p>
<p>&quot;Speak,&quot; said my Master, &quot;and be not afraid
Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him
What he demands with such solicitude.&quot;</p>
<p>Whence I: &quot;Thou peradventure marvellest,
O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;
But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.</p>
<p>This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,
Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn
To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.</p>
<p>If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,
Abandon it as false, and trust it was
Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him.&quot;</p>
<p>Already he was stooping to embrace
My Teacher&#x27;s feet; but he said to him: &quot;Brother,
Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.&quot;</p>
<p>And he uprising: &quot;Now canst thou the sum
Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,
When this our vanity I disremember,</p>
<p>Treating a shadow as substantial thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXII</p>
<p>Already was the Angel left behind us,
The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,
Having erased one mark from off my face;</p>
<p>And those who have in justice their desire
Had said to us, &quot;Beati,&quot; in their voices,
With &quot;sitio,&quot; and without more ended it.</p>
<p>And I, more light than through the other passes,
Went onward so, that without any labour
I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;</p>
<p>When thus Virgilius began: &quot;The love
Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,
Provided outwardly its flame appear.</p>
<p>Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended
Among us into the infernal Limbo,
Who made apparent to me thy affection,</p>
<p>My kindliness towards thee was as great
As ever bound one to an unseen person,
So that these stairs will now seem short to me.</p>
<p>But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,
If too great confidence let loose the rein,
And as a friend now hold discourse with me;</p>
<p>How was it possible within thy breast
For avarice to find place, &#x27;mid so much wisdom
As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?&quot;</p>
<p>These words excited Statius at first
Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:
&quot;Each word of thine is love&#x27;s dear sign to me.</p>
<p>Verily oftentimes do things appear
Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,
Instead of the true causes which are hidden!</p>
<p>Thy question shows me thy belief to be
That I was niggard in the other life,
It may be from the circle where I was;</p>
<p>Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed
Too far from me; and this extravagance
Thousands of lunar periods have punished.</p>
<p>And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,
When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,
As if indignant, unto human nature,</p>
<p>&#x27;To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger
Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?&#x27;
Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.</p>
<p>Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide
Their wings in spending, and repented me
As well of that as of my other sins;</p>
<p>How many with shorn hair shall rise again
Because of ignorance, which from this sin
Cuts off repentance living and in death!</p>
<p>And know that the transgression which rebuts
By direct opposition any sin
Together with it here its verdure dries.</p>
<p>Therefore if I have been among that folk
Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,
For its opposite has this befallen me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons
Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,&quot;
The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,</p>
<p>&quot;From that which Clio there with thee preludes,
It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful
That faith without which no good works suffice.</p>
<p>If this be so, what candles or what sun
Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim
Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to him: &quot;Thou first directedst me
Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,
And first concerning God didst me enlighten.</p>
<p>Thou didst as he who walketh in the night,
Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,
But wary makes the persons after him,</p>
<p>When thou didst say: &#x27;The age renews itself,
Justice returns, and man&#x27;s primeval time,
And a new progeny descends from heaven.&#x27;</p>
<p>Through thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian;
But that thou better see what I design,
To colour it will I extend my hand.</p>
<p>Already was the world in every part
Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated
By messengers of the eternal kingdom;</p>
<p>And thy assertion, spoken of above,
With the new preachers was in unison;
Whence I to visit them the custom took.</p>
<p>Then they became so holy in my sight,
That, when Domitian persecuted them,
Not without tears of mine were their laments;</p>
<p>And all the while that I on earth remained,
Them I befriended, and their upright customs
Made me disparage all the other sects.</p>
<p>And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers
Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,
But out of fear was covertly a Christian,</p>
<p>For a long time professing paganism;
And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle
To circuit round more than four centuries.</p>
<p>Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering
That hid from me whatever good I speak of,
While in ascending we have time to spare,</p>
<p>Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,
Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;
Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These, Persius and myself, and others many,&quot;
Replied my Leader, &quot;with that Grecian are
Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,</p>
<p>In the first circle of the prison blind;
Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse
Which has our nurses ever with itself.</p>
<p>Euripides is with us, Antiphon,
Simonides, Agatho, and many other
Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.</p>
<p>There some of thine own people may be seen,
Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,
And there Ismene mournful as of old.</p>
<p>There she is seen who pointed out Langia;
There is Tiresias&#x27; daughter, and there Thetis,
And there Deidamia with her sisters.&quot;</p>
<p>Silent already were the poets both,
Attent once more in looking round about,
From the ascent and from the walls released;</p>
<p>And four handmaidens of the day already
Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth
Was pointing upward still its burning horn,</p>
<p>What time my Guide: &quot;I think that tow&#x27;rds the edge
Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,
Circling the mount as we are wont to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus in that region custom was our ensign;
And we resumed our way with less suspicion
For the assenting of that worthy soul</p>
<p>They in advance went on, and I alone
Behind them, and I listened to their speech,
Which gave me lessons in the art of song.</p>
<p>But soon their sweet discourses interrupted
A tree which midway in the road we found,
With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.</p>
<p>And even as a fir-tree tapers upward
From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;
I think in order that no one might climb it.</p>
<p>On that side where our pathway was enclosed
Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,
And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.</p>
<p>The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,
And from among the foliage a voice
Cried: &quot;Of this food ye shall have scarcity.&quot;</p>
<p>Then said: &quot;More thoughtful Mary was of making
The marriage feast complete and honourable,
Than of her mouth which now for you responds;</p>
<p>And for their drink the ancient Roman women
With water were content; and Daniel
Disparaged food, and understanding won.</p>
<p>The primal age was beautiful as gold;
Acorns it made with hunger savorous,
And nectar every rivulet with thirst.</p>
<p>Honey and locusts were the aliments
That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;
Whence he is glorious, and so magnified</p>
<p>As by the Evangel is revealed to you.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXIII</p>
<p>The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes
I riveted, as he is wont to do
Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,</p>
<p>My more than Father said unto me: &quot;Son,
Come now; because the time that is ordained us
More usefully should be apportioned out.&quot;</p>
<p>I turned my face and no less soon my steps
Unto the Sages, who were speaking so
They made the going of no cost to me;</p>
<p>And lo! were heard a song and a lament,
&quot;Labia mea, Domine,&quot; in fashion
Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.</p>
<p>&quot;O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?&quot;
Began I; and he answered: &quot;Shades that go
Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt.&quot;</p>
<p>In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,
Who, unknown people on the road o&#x27;ertaking,
Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,</p>
<p>Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion
Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us
A crowd of spirits silent and devout.</p>
<p>Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,
Pallid in face, and so emaciate
That from the bones the skin did shape itself.</p>
<p>I do not think that so to merest rind
Could Erisichthon have been withered up
By famine, when most fear he had of it.</p>
<p>Thinking within myself I said: &quot;Behold,
This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,
When Mary made a prey of her own son.&quot;</p>
<p>Their sockets were like rings without the gems;
Whoever in the face of men reads &#x27;omo&#x27;
Might well in these have recognised the &#x27;m.&#x27;</p>
<p>Who would believe the odour of an apple,
Begetting longing, could consume them so,
And that of water, without knowing how?</p>
<p>I still was wondering what so famished them,
For the occasion not yet manifest
Of their emaciation and sad squalor;</p>
<p>And lo! from out the hollow of his head
His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;
Then cried aloud: &quot;What grace to me is this?&quot;</p>
<p>Never should I have known him by his look;
But in his voice was evident to me
That which his aspect had suppressed within it.</p>
<p>This spark within me wholly re-enkindled
My recognition of his altered face,
And I recalled the features of Forese.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,&quot;
Entreated he, &quot;which doth my skin discolour,
Nor at default of flesh that I may have;</p>
<p>But tell me truth of thee, and who are those
Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;
Do not delay in speaking unto me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,
Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,&quot;
I answered him, &quot;beholding it so changed!</p>
<p>But tell me, for God&#x27;s sake, what thus denudes you?
Make me not speak while I am marvelling,
For ill speaks he who&#x27;s full of other longings.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;From the eternal council
Falls power into the water and the tree
Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.</p>
<p>All of this people who lamenting sing,
For following beyond measure appetite
In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.</p>
<p>Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us
The scent that issues from the apple-tree,
And from the spray that sprinkles o&#x27;er the verdure;</p>
<p>And not a single time alone, this ground
Encompassing, is refreshed our pain,--
I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,--</p>
<p>For the same wish doth lead us to the tree
Which led the Christ rejoicing to say &#x27;Eli,&#x27;
When with his veins he liberated us.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;Forese, from that day
When for a better life thou changedst worlds,
Up to this time five years have not rolled round.</p>
<p>If sooner were the power exhausted in thee
Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised
Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,</p>
<p>How hast thou come up hitherward already?
I thought to find thee down there underneath,
Where time for time doth restitution make.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Thus speedily has led me
To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,
My Nella with her overflowing tears;</p>
<p>She with her prayers devout and with her sighs
Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,
And from the other circles set me free.</p>
<p>So much more dear and pleasing is to God
My little widow, whom so much I loved,
As in good works she is the more alone;</p>
<p>For the Barbagia of Sardinia
By far more modest in its women is
Than the Barbagia I have left her in.</p>
<p>O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?
A future time is in my sight already,
To which this hour will not be very old,</p>
<p>When from the pulpit shall be interdicted
To the unblushing womankind of Florence
To go about displaying breast and paps.</p>
<p>What savages were e&#x27;er, what Saracens,
Who stood in need, to make them covered go,
Of spiritual or other discipline?</p>
<p>But if the shameless women were assured
Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already
Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;</p>
<p>For if my foresight here deceive me not,
They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks
Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.</p>
<p>O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;
See that not only I, but all these people
Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun.&quot;</p>
<p>Whence I to him: &quot;If thou bring back to mind
What thou with me hast been and I with thee,
The present memory will be grievous still.</p>
<p>Out of that life he turned me back who goes
In front of me, two days agone when round
The sister of him yonder showed herself,&quot;</p>
<p>And to the sun I pointed.  &quot;Through the deep
Night of the truly dead has this one led me,
With this true flesh, that follows after him.</p>
<p>Thence his encouragements have led me up,
Ascending and still circling round the mount
That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.</p>
<p>He says that he will bear me company,
Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;
There it behoves me to remain without him.</p>
<p>This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,&quot;
And him I pointed at; &quot;the other is
That shade for whom just now shook every slope</p>
<p>Your realm, that from itself discharges him.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXIV</p>
<p>Nor speech the going, nor the going that
Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,
Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.</p>
<p>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,
From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed
Wonder at me, aware that I was living.</p>
<p>And I, continuing my colloquy,
Said: &quot;Peradventure he goes up more slowly
Than he would do, for other people&#x27;s sake.</p>
<p>But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;
Tell me if any one of note I see
Among this folk that gazes at me so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My sister, who, &#x27;twixt beautiful and good,
I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing
Already in her crown on high Olympus.&quot;</p>
<p>So said he first, and then: &quot;&#x27;Tis not forbidden
To name each other here, so milked away
Is our resemblance by our dieting.</p>
<p>This,&quot; pointing with his finger, &quot;is Buonagiunta,
Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face
Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,</p>
<p>Has held the holy Church within his arms;
From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting
Bolsena&#x27;s eels and the Vernaccia wine.&quot;</p>
<p>He named me many others one by one;
And all contented seemed at being named,
So that for this I saw not one dark look.</p>
<p>I saw for hunger bite the empty air
Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,
Who with his crook had pastured many people.</p>
<p>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure
Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,
And he was one who ne&#x27;er felt satisfied.</p>
<p>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize
One more than others, did I him of Lucca,
Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.</p>
<p>He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca
From that place heard I, where he felt the wound
Of justice, that doth macerate them so.</p>
<p>&quot;O soul,&quot; I said, &quot;that seemest so desirous
To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,
And with thy speech appease thyself and me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,&quot;
Began he, &quot;who to thee shall pleasant make
My city, howsoever men may blame it.</p>
<p>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;
If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,
True things hereafter will declare it to thee.</p>
<p>But say if him I here behold, who forth
Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,
&#x27;Ladies, that have intelligence of love?&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;One am I, who, whenever
Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure
Which he within me dictates, singing go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O brother, now I see,&quot; he said, &quot;the knot
Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held
Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.</p>
<p>I do perceive full clearly how your pens
Go closely following after him who dictates,
Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;</p>
<p>And he who sets himself to go beyond,
No difference sees from one style to another;&quot;
And as if satisfied, he held his peace.</p>
<p>Even as the birds, that winter tow&#x27;rds the Nile,
Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,
Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;</p>
<p>In such wise all the people who were there,
Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,
Both by their leanness and their wishes light.</p>
<p>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,
Lets his companions onward go, and walks,
Until he vents the panting of his chest;</p>
<p>So did Forese let the holy flock
Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,
&quot;When will it be that I again shall see thee?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long,&quot; I answered, &quot;I may live, I know not;
Yet my return will not so speedy be,
But I shall sooner in desire arrive;</p>
<p>Because the place where I was set to live
From day to day of good is more depleted,
And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now go,&quot; he said, &quot;for him most guilty of it
At a beast&#x27;s tail behold I dragged along
Towards the valley where is no repentance.</p>
<p>Faster at every step the beast is going,
Increasing evermore until it smites him,
And leaves the body vilely mutilated.</p>
<p>Not long those wheels shall turn,&quot; and he uplifted
His eyes to heaven, &quot;ere shall be clear to thee
That which my speech no farther can declare.</p>
<p>Now stay behind; because the time so precious</p>
<p>Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much
By coming onward thus abreast with thee.&quot;</p>
<p>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop
A cavalier from out a troop that ride,
And seeks the honour of the first encounter,</p>
<p>So he with greater strides departed from us;
And on the road remained I with those two,
Who were such mighty marshals of the world.</p>
<p>And when before us he had gone so far
Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants
As was my understanding to his words,</p>
<p>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs
Another apple-tree, and not far distant,
From having but just then turned thitherward.</p>
<p>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,
And cry I know not what towards the leaves,
Like little children eager and deluded,</p>
<p>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,
But, to make very keen their appetite,
Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.</p>
<p>Then they departed as if undeceived;
And now we came unto the mighty tree
Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.</p>
<p>&quot;Pass farther onward without drawing near;
The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,
And out of that one has this tree been raised.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus said I know not who among the branches;
Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself
Went crowding forward on the side that rises.</p>
<p>&quot;Be mindful,&quot; said he, &quot;of the accursed ones
Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate
Combated Theseus with their double breasts;</p>
<p>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,
Whence Gideon would not have them for companions
When he tow&#x27;rds Midian the hills descended.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,
On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,
Followed forsooth by miserable gains;</p>
<p>Then set at large upon the lonely road,
A thousand steps and more we onward went,
In contemplation, each without a word.</p>
<p>&quot;What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?&quot;
Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started
As terrified and timid beasts are wont.</p>
<p>I raised my head to see who this might be,
And never in a furnace was there seen
Metals or glass so lucent and so red</p>
<p>As one I saw who said: &quot;If it may please you
To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;
This way goes he who goeth after peace.&quot;</p>
<p>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,
So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,
Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.</p>
<p>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,
The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,
Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,</p>
<p>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst
My front, and felt the moving of the plumes
That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;</p>
<p>And heard it said: &quot;Blessed are they whom grace
So much illumines, that the love of taste
Excites not in their breasts too great desire,</p>
<p>Hungering at all times so far as is just.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXV</p>
<p>Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,
Because the sun had his meridian circle
To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;</p>
<p>Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,
But goes his way, whate&#x27;er to him appear,
If of necessity the sting transfix him,</p>
<p>In this wise did we enter through the gap,
Taking the stairway, one before the other,
Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.</p>
<p>And as the little stork that lifts its wing
With a desire to fly, and does not venture
To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,</p>
<p>Even such was I, with the desire of asking
Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming
He makes who doth address himself to speak.</p>
<p>Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,
My father sweet forbore, but said: &quot;Let fly
The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.&quot;</p>
<p>With confidence I opened then my mouth,
And I began: &quot;How can one meagre grow
There where the need of nutriment applies not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager
Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,
This would not,&quot; said he, &quot;be to thee so sour;</p>
<p>And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion
Trembles within a mirror your own image;
That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.</p>
<p>But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish
Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray
He now will be the healer of thy wounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,&quot;
Responded Statius, &quot;where thou present art,
Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he began: &quot;Son, if these words of mine
Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,
They&#x27;ll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.</p>
<p>The perfect blood, which never is drunk up
Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth
Like food that from the table thou removest,</p>
<p>Takes in the heart for all the human members
Virtue informative, as being that
Which to be changed to them goes through the veins</p>
<p>Again digest, descends it where &#x27;tis better
Silent to be than say; and then drops thence
Upon another&#x27;s blood in natural vase.</p>
<p>There one together with the other mingles,
One to be passive meant, the other active
By reason of the perfect place it springs from;</p>
<p>And being conjoined, begins to operate,
Coagulating first, then vivifying
What for its matter it had made consistent.</p>
<p>The active virtue, being made a soul
As of a plant, (in so far different,
This on the way is, that arrived already,)</p>
<p>Then works so much, that now it moves and feels
Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes
To organize the powers whose seed it is.</p>
<p>Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself
The virtue from the generator&#x27;s heart,
Where nature is intent on all the members.</p>
<p>But how from animal it man becomes
Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point
Which made a wiser man than thou once err</p>
<p>So far, that in his doctrine separate
He made the soul from possible intellect,
For he no organ saw by this assumed.</p>
<p>Open thy breast unto the truth that&#x27;s coming,
And know that, just as soon as in the foetus
The articulation of the brain is perfect,</p>
<p>The primal Motor turns to it well pleased
At so great art of nature, and inspires
A spirit new with virtue all replete,</p>
<p>Which what it finds there active doth attract
Into its substance, and becomes one soul,
Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.</p>
<p>And that thou less may wonder at my word,
Behold the sun&#x27;s heat, which becometh wine,
Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.</p>
<p>Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,
It separates from the flesh, and virtually
Bears with itself the human and divine;</p>
<p>The other faculties are voiceless all;
The memory, the intelligence, and the will
In action far more vigorous than before.</p>
<p>Without a pause it falleth of itself
In marvellous way on one shore or the other;
There of its roads it first is cognizant.</p>
<p>Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,
The virtue informative rays round about,
As, and as much as, in the living members.</p>
<p>And even as the air, when full of rain,
By alien rays that are therein reflected,
With divers colours shows itself adorned,</p>
<p>So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself
Into that form which doth impress upon it
Virtually the soul that has stood still.</p>
<p>And then in manner of the little flame,
Which followeth the fire where&#x27;er it shifts,
After the spirit followeth its new form.</p>
<p>Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,
It is called shade; and thence it organizes
Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.</p>
<p>Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;
Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,
That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.</p>
<p>According as impress us our desires
And other affections, so the shade is shaped,
And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.&quot;</p>
<p>And now unto the last of all the circles
Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,
And were attentive to another care.</p>
<p>There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,
And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast
That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.</p>
<p>Hence we must needs go on the open side,
And one by one; and I did fear the fire
On this side, and on that the falling down.</p>
<p>My Leader said: &quot;Along this place one ought
To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,
Seeing that one so easily might err.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Summae Deus clementiae,&quot; in the bosom
Of the great burning chanted then I heard,
Which made me no less eager to turn round;</p>
<p>And spirits saw I walking through the flame;
Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs
Apportioning my sight from time to time.</p>
<p>After the close which to that hymn is made,
Aloud they shouted, &quot;Virum non cognosco;&quot;
Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.</p>
<p>This also ended, cried they: &quot;To the wood
Diana ran, and drove forth Helice
Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.&quot;</p>
<p>Then to their song returned they; then the wives
They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.
As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.</p>
<p>And I believe that them this mode suffices,
For all the time the fire is burning them;
With such care is it needful, and such food,</p>
<p>That the last wound of all should be closed up.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXVI</p>
<p>While on the brink thus one before the other
We went upon our way, oft the good Master
Said: &quot;Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.&quot;</p>
<p>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,
That, raying out, already the whole west
Changed from its azure aspect into white.</p>
<p>And with my shadow did I make the flame
Appear more red; and even to such a sign
Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.</p>
<p>This was the cause that gave them a beginning
To speak of me; and to themselves began they
To say: &quot;That seems not a factitious body!&quot;</p>
<p>Then towards me, as far as they could come,
Came certain of them, always with regard
Not to step forth where they would not be burned.</p>
<p>&quot;O thou who goest, not from being slower
But reverent perhaps, behind the others,
Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.</p>
<p>Nor to me only is thine answer needful;
For all of these have greater thirst for it
Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.</p>
<p>Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself
A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not
Entered as yet into the net of death.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight
Should have revealed myself, were I not bent
On other novelty that then appeared.</p>
<p>For through the middle of the burning road
There came a people face to face with these,
Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.</p>
<p>There see I hastening upon either side
Each of the shades, and kissing one another
Without a pause, content with brief salute.</p>
<p>Thus in the middle of their brown battalions
Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another
Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.</p>
<p>No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,
Or ever the first footstep passes onward,
Each one endeavours to outcry the other;</p>
<p>The new-come people: &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah!&quot;
The rest: &quot;Into the cow Pasiphae enters,
So that the bull unto her lust may run!&quot;</p>
<p>Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains
Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,
These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,</p>
<p>One folk is going, and the other coming,
And weeping they return to their first songs,
And to the cry that most befitteth them;</p>
<p>And close to me approached, even as before,
The very same who had entreated me,
Attent to listen in their countenance.</p>
<p>I, who their inclination twice had seen,
Began: &quot;O souls secure in the possession,
Whene&#x27;er it may be, of a state of peace,</p>
<p>Neither unripe nor ripened have remained
My members upon earth, but here are with me
With their own blood and their articulations.</p>
<p>I go up here to be no longer blind;
A Lady is above, who wins this grace,
Whereby the mortal through your world I bring.</p>
<p>But as your greatest longing satisfied
May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you
Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,</p>
<p>Tell me, that I again in books may write it,
Who are you, and what is that multitude
Which goes upon its way behind your backs?&quot;</p>
<p>Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered
The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,
When rough and rustic to the town he goes,</p>
<p>Than every shade became in its appearance;
But when they of their stupor were disburdened,
Which in high hearts is quickly quieted,</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,&quot;
He recommenced who first had questioned us,
&quot;Experience freightest for a better life.</p>
<p>The folk that comes not with us have offended
In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,
Heard himself called in contumely, &#x27;Queen.&#x27;</p>
<p>Therefore they separate, exclaiming, &#x27;Sodom!&#x27;
Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,
And add unto their burning by their shame.</p>
<p>Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;
But because we observed not human law,
Following like unto beasts our appetite,</p>
<p>In our opprobrium by us is read,
When we part company, the name of her
Who bestialized herself in bestial wood.</p>
<p>Now knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was;
Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are,
There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.</p>
<p>Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;
I&#x27;m Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,
Having repented ere the hour extreme.&quot;</p>
<p>The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus
Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,
Such I became, but rise not to such height,</p>
<p>The moment I heard name himself the father
Of me and of my betters, who had ever
Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;</p>
<p>And without speech and hearing thoughtfully
For a long time I went, beholding him,
Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.</p>
<p>When I was fed with looking, utterly
Myself I offered ready for his service,
With affirmation that compels belief.</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Thou leavest footprints such
In me, from what I hear, and so distinct,
Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.</p>
<p>But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,
Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest
In word and look that dear thou holdest me?&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;Those dulcet lays of yours
Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,
Shall make for ever dear their very ink!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O brother,&quot; said he, &quot;he whom I point out,&quot;
And here he pointed at a spirit in front,
&quot;Was of the mother tongue a better smith.</p>
<p>Verses of love and proses of romance,
He mastered all; and let the idiots talk,
Who think the Lemosin surpasses him.</p>
<p>To clamour more than truth they turn their faces,
And in this way establish their opinion,
Ere art or reason has by them been heard.</p>
<p>Thus many ancients with Guittone did,
From cry to cry still giving him applause,
Until the truth has conquered with most persons.</p>
<p>Now, if thou hast such ample privilege
&#x27;Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister
Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,</p>
<p>To him repeat for me a Paternoster,
So far as needful to us of this world,
Where power of sinning is no longer ours.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, to give place perchance to one behind,
Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire
As fish in water going to the bottom.</p>
<p>I moved a little tow&#x27;rds him pointed out,
And said that to his name my own desire
An honourable place was making ready.</p>
<p>He of his own free will began to say:
&#x27;Tan m&#x27; abellis vostre cortes deman,
Que jeu nom&#x27; puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire;</p>
<p>Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan;
Consiros vei la passada folor,
E vei jauzen lo jorn qu&#x27; esper denan.</p>
<p>Ara vus prec per aquella valor,
Que vus condus al som de la scalina,
Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.&#x27;*</p>
<p>Then hid him in the fire that purifies them.</p>
<ul>
<li>So pleases me your courteous demand,
I cannot and I will not hide me from you.
I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;
Contrite I see the folly of the past,
And joyous see the hoped-for day before me.
Therefore do I implore you, by that power
Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,
Be mindful to assuage my suffering!</li>
</ul>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXVII</p>
<p>As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,
In regions where his Maker shed his blood,
(The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,</p>
<p>And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)
So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,
When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.</p>
<p>Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,
And chanted forth, &quot;Beati mundo corde,&quot;
In voice by far more living than our own.</p>
<p>Then: &quot;No one farther goes, souls sanctified,
If first the fire bite not; within it enter,
And be not deaf unto the song beyond.&quot;</p>
<p>When we were close beside him thus he said;
Wherefore e&#x27;en such became I, when I heard him,
As he is who is put into the grave.</p>
<p>Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,
Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling
The human bodies I had once seen burned.</p>
<p>Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,
And unto me Virgilius said: &quot;My son,
Here may indeed be torment, but not death.</p>
<p>Remember thee, remember! and if I
On Geryon have safely guided thee,
What shall I do now I am nearer God?</p>
<p>Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full
Millennium in the bosom of this flame,
It could not make thee bald a single hair.</p>
<p>And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,
Draw near to it, and put it to the proof
With thine own hands upon thy garment&#x27;s hem.</p>
<p>Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,
Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;&quot;
And I still motionless, and &#x27;gainst my conscience!</p>
<p>Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,
Somewhat disturbed he said: &quot;Now look thou, Son,
&#x27;Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.&quot;</p>
<p>As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids
The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,
What time the mulberry became vermilion,</p>
<p>Even thus, my obduracy being softened,
I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name
That in my memory evermore is welling.</p>
<p>Whereat he wagged his head, and said: &quot;How now?
Shall we stay on this side?&quot; then smiled as one
Does at a child who&#x27;s vanquished by an apple.</p>
<p>Then into the fire in front of me he entered,
Beseeching Statius to come after me,
Who a long way before divided us.</p>
<p>When I was in it, into molten glass
I would have cast me to refresh myself,
So without measure was the burning there!</p>
<p>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,
Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,
Saying: &quot;Her eyes I seem to see already!&quot;</p>
<p>A voice, that on the other side was singing,
Directed us, and we, attent alone
On that, came forth where the ascent began.</p>
<p>&quot;Venite, benedicti Patris mei,&quot;
Sounded within a splendour, which was there
Such it o&#x27;ercame me, and I could not look.</p>
<p>&quot;The sun departs,&quot; it added, &quot;and night cometh;
Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,
So long as yet the west becomes not dark.&quot;</p>
<p>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended
In such a way that I cut off the rays
Before me of the sun, that now was low.</p>
<p>And of few stairs we yet had made assay,
Ere by the vanished shadow the sun&#x27;s setting
Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.</p>
<p>And ere in all its parts immeasurable
The horizon of one aspect had become,
And Night her boundless dispensation held,</p>
<p>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;
Because the nature of the mount took from us
The power of climbing, more than the delight.</p>
<p>Even as in ruminating passive grow
The goats, who have been swift and venturesome
Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,</p>
<p>Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,
Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff
Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;</p>
<p>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,
Passes the night beside his quiet flock,
Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,</p>
<p>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,
I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,
Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.</p>
<p>Little could there be seen of things without;
But through that little I beheld the stars
More luminous and larger than their wont.</p>
<p>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,
Sleep seized upon me,--sleep, that oftentimes
Before a deed is done has tidings of it.</p>
<p>It was the hour, I think, when from the East
First on the mountain Citherea beamed,
Who with the fire of love seems always burning;</p>
<p>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought
I saw a lady walking in a meadow,
Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:</p>
<p>&quot;Know whosoever may my name demand
That I am Leah, and go moving round
My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.</p>
<p>To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,
But never does my sister Rachel leave
Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.</p>
<p>To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,
As I am to adorn me with my hands;
Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.&quot;</p>
<p>And now before the antelucan splendours
That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,
As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,</p>
<p>The darkness fled away on every side,
And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,
Seeing already the great Masters risen.</p>
<p>&quot;That apple sweet, which through so many branches
The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,
To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words
As these made use; and never were there guerdons
That could in pleasantness compare with these.</p>
<p>Such longing upon longing came upon me
To be above, that at each step thereafter
For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.</p>
<p>When underneath us was the stairway all
Run o&#x27;er, and we were on the highest step,
Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,</p>
<p>And said: &quot;The temporal fire and the eternal,
Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come
Where of myself no farther I discern.</p>
<p>By intellect and art I here have brought thee;
Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;
Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.</p>
<p>Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;
Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs
Which of itself alone this land produces.</p>
<p>Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes
Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,
Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.</p>
<p>Expect no more or word or sign from me;
Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,
And error were it not to do its bidding;</p>
<p>Thee o&#x27;er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXVIII</p>
<p>Eager already to search in and round
The heavenly forest, dense and living-green,
Which tempered to the eyes the new-born day,</p>
<p>Withouten more delay I left the bank,
Taking the level country slowly, slowly
Over the soil that everywhere breathes fragrance.</p>
<p>A softly-breathing air, that no mutation
Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me
No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,</p>
<p>Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous,
Did all of them bow downward toward that side
Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain;</p>
<p>Yet not from their upright direction swayed,
So that the little birds upon their tops
Should leave the practice of each art of theirs;</p>
<p>But with full ravishment the hours of prime,
Singing, received they in the midst of leaves,
That ever bore a burden to their rhymes,</p>
<p>Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on
Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi,
When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco.</p>
<p>Already my slow steps had carried me
Into the ancient wood so far, that I
Could not perceive where I had entered it.</p>
<p>And lo! my further course a stream cut off,
Which tow&#x27;rd the left hand with its little waves
Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.</p>
<p>All waters that on earth most limpid are
Would seem to have within themselves some mixture
Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,</p>
<p>Although it moves on with a brown, brown current
Under the shade perpetual, that never
Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon.</p>
<p>With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed
Beyond the rivulet, to look upon
The great variety of the fresh may.</p>
<p>And there appeared to me (even as appears
Suddenly something that doth turn aside
Through very wonder every other thought)</p>
<p>A lady all alone, who went along
Singing and culling floweret after floweret,
With which her pathway was all painted over.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love
Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,
Which the heart&#x27;s witnesses are wont to be,</p>
<p>May the desire come unto thee to draw
Near to this river&#x27;s bank,&quot; I said to her,
&quot;So much that I might hear what thou art singing.</p>
<p>Thou makest me remember where and what
Proserpina that moment was when lost
Her mother her, and she herself the Spring.&quot;</p>
<p>As turns herself, with feet together pressed
And to the ground, a lady who is dancing,
And hardly puts one foot before the other,</p>
<p>On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets
She turned towards me, not in other wise
Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;</p>
<p>And my entreaties made to be content,
So near approaching, that the dulcet sound
Came unto me together with its meaning</p>
<p>As soon as she was where the grasses are.
Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,
To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.</p>
<p>I do not think there shone so great a light
Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed
By her own son, beyond his usual custom!</p>
<p>Erect upon the other bank she smiled,
Bearing full many colours in her hands,
Which that high land produces without seed.</p>
<p>Apart three paces did the river make us;
But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,
(A curb still to all human arrogance,)</p>
<p>More hatred from Leander did not suffer
For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,
Than that from me, because it oped not then.</p>
<p>&quot;Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,&quot;
Began she, &quot;peradventure, in this place
Elect to human nature for its nest,</p>
<p>Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;
But the psalm &#x27;Delectasti&#x27; giveth light
Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.</p>
<p>And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,
Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready
To all thy questionings, as far as needful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The water,&quot; said I, &quot;and the forest&#x27;s sound,
Are combating within me my new faith
In something which I heard opposed to this.&quot;</p>
<p>Whence she: &quot;I will relate how from its cause
Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,
And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.</p>
<p>The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,
Created man good, and this goodly place
Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.</p>
<p>By his default short while he sojourned here;
By his default to weeping and to toil
He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.</p>
<p>That the disturbance which below is made
By exhalations of the land and water,
(Which far as may be follow after heat,)</p>
<p>Might not upon mankind wage any war,
This mount ascended tow&#x27;rds the heaven so high,
And is exempt, from there where it is locked.</p>
<p>Now since the universal atmosphere
Turns in a circuit with the primal motion
Unless the circle is broken on some side,</p>
<p>Upon this height, that all is disengaged
In living ether, doth this motion strike
And make the forest sound, for it is dense;</p>
<p>And so much power the stricken plant possesses
That with its virtue it impregns the air,
And this, revolving, scatters it around;</p>
<p>And yonder earth, according as &#x27;tis worthy
In self or in its clime, conceives and bears
Of divers qualities the divers trees;</p>
<p>It should not seem a marvel then on earth,
This being heard, whenever any plant
Without seed manifest there taketh root.</p>
<p>And thou must know, this holy table-land
In which thou art is full of every seed,
And fruit has in it never gathered there.</p>
<p>The water which thou seest springs not from vein
Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,
Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;</p>
<p>But issues from a fountain safe and certain,
Which by the will of God as much regains
As it discharges, open on two sides.</p>
<p>Upon this side with virtue it descends,
Which takes away all memory of sin;
On that, of every good deed done restores it.</p>
<p>Here Lethe, as upon the other side
Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not
If first on either side it be not tasted.</p>
<p>This every other savour doth transcend;
And notwithstanding slaked so far may be
Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll give thee a corollary still in grace,
Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear
If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.</p>
<p>Those who in ancient times have feigned in song
The Age of Gold and its felicity,
Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.</p>
<p>Here was the human race in innocence;
Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;
This is the nectar of which each one speaks.&quot;</p>
<p>Then backward did I turn me wholly round
Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile
They had been listening to these closing words;</p>
<p>Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXIX</p>
<p>Singing like unto an enamoured lady
She, with the ending of her words, continued:
&quot;Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.&quot;</p>
<p>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone
Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous
One to avoid and one to see the sun,</p>
<p>She then against the stream moved onward, going
Along the bank, and I abreast of her,
Her little steps with little steps attending.</p>
<p>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,
When equally the margins gave a turn,
In such a way, that to the East I faced.</p>
<p>Nor even thus our way continued far
Before the lady wholly turned herself
Unto me, saying, &quot;Brother, look and listen!&quot;</p>
<p>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across
On every side athwart the spacious forest,
Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.</p>
<p>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,
And that continuing brightened more and more,
Within my thought I said, &quot;What thing is this?&quot;</p>
<p>And a delicious melody there ran
Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal
Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;</p>
<p>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,
The woman only, and but just created,
Could not endure to stay &#x27;neath any veil;</p>
<p>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,
I sooner should have tasted those delights
Ineffable, and for a longer time.</p>
<p>While &#x27;mid such manifold first-fruits I walked
Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,
And still solicitous of more delights,</p>
<p>In front of us like an enkindled fire
Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,
And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.</p>
<p>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,
Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,
The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!</p>
<p>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,
And with her choir Urania must assist me,
To put in verse things difficult to think.</p>
<p>A little farther on, seven trees of gold
In semblance the long space still intervening
Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;</p>
<p>But when I had approached so near to them
The common object, which the sense deceives,
Lost not by distance any of its marks,</p>
<p>The faculty that lends discourse to reason
Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,
And in the voices of the song &quot;Hosanna!&quot;</p>
<p>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,
Far brighter than the moon in the serene
Of midnight, at the middle of her month.</p>
<p>I turned me round, with admiration filled,
To good Virgilius, and he answered me
With visage no less full of wonderment.</p>
<p>Then back I turned my face to those high things,
Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,
They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.</p>
<p>The lady chid me: &quot;Why dost thou burn only
So with affection for the living lights,
And dost not look at what comes after them?&quot;</p>
<p>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,
Coming behind them, garmented in white,
And such a whiteness never was on earth.</p>
<p>The water on my left flank was resplendent,
And back to me reflected my left side,
E&#x27;en as a mirror, if I looked therein.</p>
<p>When I upon my margin had such post
That nothing but the stream divided us,
Better to see I gave my steps repose;</p>
<p>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,
Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,
And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,</p>
<p>So that it overhead remained distinct
With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours
Whence the sun&#x27;s bow is made, and Delia&#x27;s girdle.</p>
<p>These standards to the rearward longer were
Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,
Ten paces were the outermost apart.</p>
<p>Under so fair a heaven as I describe
The four and twenty Elders, two by two,
Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.</p>
<p>They all of them were singing: &quot;Blessed thou
Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed
For evermore shall be thy loveliness.&quot;</p>
<p>After the flowers and other tender grasses
In front of me upon the other margin
Were disencumbered of that race elect,</p>
<p>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,
There came close after them four animals,
Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.</p>
<p>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,
The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus
If they were living would be such as these.</p>
<p>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste
My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,
That I in this cannot be prodigal.</p>
<p>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them
As he beheld them from the region cold
Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;</p>
<p>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,
Such were they here; saving that in their plumage
John is with me, and differeth from him.</p>
<p>The interval between these four contained
A chariot triumphal on two wheels,
Which by a Griffin&#x27;s neck came drawn along;</p>
<p>And upward he extended both his wings
Between the middle list and three and three,
So that he injured none by cleaving it.</p>
<p>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;
His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,
And white the others with vermilion mingled.</p>
<p>Not only Rome with no such splendid car
E&#x27;er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,
But poor to it that of the Sun would be,--</p>
<p>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up
At the importunate orison of Earth,
When Jove was so mysteriously just.</p>
<p>Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle
Came onward dancing; one so very red
That in the fire she hardly had been noted.</p>
<p>The second was as if her flesh and bones
Had all been fashioned out of emerald;
The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.</p>
<p>And now they seemed conducted by the white,
Now by the red, and from the song of her
The others took their step, or slow or swift.</p>
<p>Upon the left hand four made holiday
Vested in purple, following the measure
Of one of them with three eyes m her head.</p>
<p>In rear of all the group here treated of
Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,
But like in gait, each dignified and grave.</p>
<p>One showed himself as one of the disciples
Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature
Made for the animals she holds most dear;</p>
<p>Contrary care the other manifested,
With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused
Terror to me on this side of the river.</p>
<p>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,
And behind all an aged man alone
Walking in sleep with countenance acute.</p>
<p>And like the foremost company these seven
Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce
No garland round about the head they wore,</p>
<p>But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;
At little distance would the sight have sworn
That all were in a flame above their brows.</p>
<p>And when the car was opposite to me
Thunder was heard; and all that folk august
Seemed to have further progress interdicted,</p>
<p>There with the vanward ensigns standing still.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXX</p>
<p>When the Septentrion of the highest heaven
(Which never either setting knew or rising,
Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin,</p>
<p>And which made every one therein aware
Of his own duty, as the lower makes
Whoever turns the helm to come to port)</p>
<p>Motionless halted, the veracious people,
That came at first between it and the Griffin,
Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.</p>
<p>And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,
Singing, &quot;Veni, sponsa, de Libano&quot;
Shouted three times, and all the others after.</p>
<p>Even as the Blessed at the final summons
Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,
Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,</p>
<p>So upon that celestial chariot
A hundred rose &#x27;ad vocem tanti senis,&#x27;
Ministers and messengers of life eternal.</p>
<p>They all were saying, &quot;Benedictus qui venis,&quot;
And, scattering flowers above and round about,
&quot;Manibus o date lilia plenis.&quot;</p>
<p>Ere now have I beheld, as day began,
The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,
And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;</p>
<p>And the sun&#x27;s face, uprising, overshadowed
So that by tempering influence of vapours
For a long interval the eye sustained it;</p>
<p>Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers
Which from those hands angelical ascended,
And downward fell again inside and out,</p>
<p>Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct
Appeared a lady under a green mantle,
Vested in colour of the living flame.</p>
<p>And my own spirit, that already now
So long a time had been, that in her presence
Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,</p>
<p>Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,
Through occult virtue that from her proceeded
Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.</p>
<p>As soon as on my vision smote the power
Sublime, that had already pierced me through
Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,</p>
<p>To the left hand I turned with that reliance
With which the little child runs to his mother,
When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,</p>
<p>To say unto Virgilius: &quot;Not a drachm
Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;
I know the traces of the ancient flame.&quot;</p>
<p>But us Virgilius of himself deprived
Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,
Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:</p>
<p>Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother
Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,
That weeping they should not again be darkened.</p>
<p>&quot;Dante, because Virgilius has departed
Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;
For by another sword thou need&#x27;st must weep.&quot;</p>
<p>E&#x27;en as an admiral, who on poop and prow
Comes to behold the people that are working
In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,</p>
<p>Upon the left hand border of the car,
When at the sound I turned of my own name,
Which of necessity is here recorded,</p>
<p>I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared
Veiled underneath the angelic festival,
Direct her eyes to me across the river.</p>
<p>Although the veil, that from her head descended,
Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,
Did not permit her to appear distinctly,</p>
<p>In attitude still royally majestic
Continued she, like unto one who speaks,
And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:</p>
<p>&quot;Look at me well; in sooth I&#x27;m Beatrice!
How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?
Didst thou not know that man is happy here?&quot;</p>
<p>Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,
But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,
So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.</p>
<p>As to the son the mother seems superb,
So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter
Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.</p>
<p>Silent became she, and the Angels sang
Suddenly, &quot;In te, Domine, speravi:&quot;
But beyond &#x27;pedes meos&#x27; did not pass.</p>
<p>Even as the snow among the living rafters
Upon the back of Italy congeals,
Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,</p>
<p>And then, dissolving, trickles through itself
Whene&#x27;er the land that loses shadow breathes,
So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;</p>
<p>E&#x27;en thus was I without a tear or sigh,
Before the song of those who sing for ever
After the music of the eternal spheres.</p>
<p>But when I heard in their sweet melodies
Compassion for me, more than had they said,
&quot;O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?&quot;</p>
<p>The ice, that was about my heart congealed,
To air and water changed, and in my anguish
Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.</p>
<p>She, on the right-hand border of the car
Still firmly standing, to those holy beings
Thus her discourse directed afterwards:</p>
<p>&quot;Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,
So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you
One step the ages make upon their path;</p>
<p>Therefore my answer is with greater care,
That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,
So that the sin and dole be of one measure.</p>
<p>Not only by the work of those great wheels,
That destine every seed unto some end,
According as the stars are in conjunction,</p>
<p>But by the largess of celestial graces,
Which have such lofty vapours for their rain
That near to them our sight approaches not,</p>
<p>Such had this man become in his new life
Potentially, that every righteous habit
Would have made admirable proof in him;</p>
<p>But so much more malignant and more savage
Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,
The more good earthly vigour it possesses.</p>
<p>Some time did I sustain him with my look;
Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,
I led him with me turned in the right way.</p>
<p>As soon as ever of my second age
I was upon the threshold and changed life,
Himself from me he took and gave to others.</p>
<p>When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,
And beauty and virtue were in me increased,
I was to him less dear and less delightful;</p>
<p>And into ways untrue he turned his steps,
Pursuing the false images of good,
That never any promises fulfil;</p>
<p>Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,
By means of which in dreams and otherwise
I called him back, so little did he heed them.</p>
<p>So low he fell, that all appliances
For his salvation were already short,
Save showing him the people of perdition.</p>
<p>For this I visited the gates of death,
And unto him, who so far up has led him,
My intercessions were with weeping borne.</p>
<p>God&#x27;s lofty fiat would be violated,
If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands
Should tasted be, withouten any scot</p>
<p>Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears.&quot;</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXXI</p>
<p>&quot;O thou who art beyond the sacred river,&quot;
Turning to me the point of her discourse,
That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,</p>
<p>She recommenced, continuing without pause,
&quot;Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,
Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.&quot;</p>
<p>My faculties were in so great confusion,
That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct
Than by its organs it was set at large.</p>
<p>Awhile she waited; then she said: &quot;What thinkest?
Answer me; for the mournful memories
In thee not yet are by the waters injured.&quot;</p>
<p>Confusion and dismay together mingled
Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight
Was needful to the understanding of it.</p>
<p>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when &#x27;tis discharged
Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,
And with less force the arrow hits the mark,</p>
<p>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,
Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,
And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.</p>
<p>Whence she to me: &quot;In those desires of mine
Which led thee to the loving of that good,
Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,</p>
<p>What trenches lying traverse or what chains
Didst thou discover, that of passing onward
Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?</p>
<p>And what allurements or what vantages
Upon the forehead of the others showed,
That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?&quot;</p>
<p>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,
Hardly had I the voice to make response,
And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.</p>
<p>Weeping I said: &quot;The things that present were
With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,
Soon as your countenance concealed itself.&quot;</p>
<p>And she: &quot;Shouldst thou be silent, or deny
What thou confessest, not less manifest
Would be thy fault, by such a Judge &#x27;tis known.</p>
<p>But when from one&#x27;s own cheeks comes bursting forth
The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal
Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.</p>
<p>But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame
For thy transgression, and another time
Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,</p>
<p>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;
So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way
My buried flesh should have directed thee.</p>
<p>Never to thee presented art or nature
Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein
I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.</p>
<p>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee
By reason of my death, what mortal thing
Should then have drawn thee into its desire?</p>
<p>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft
Of things fallacious to have risen up
To follow me, who was no longer such.</p>
<p>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward
To wait for further blows, or little girl,
Or other vanity of such brief use.</p>
<p>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,
But to the eyes of those already fledged,
In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as children silent in their shame
Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,
And conscious of their fault, and penitent;</p>
<p>So was I standing; and she said: &quot;If thou
In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard
And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.&quot;</p>
<p>With less resistance is a robust holm
Uprooted, either by a native wind
Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,</p>
<p>Than I upraised at her command my chin;
And when she by the beard the face demanded,
Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.</p>
<p>And as my countenance was lifted up,
Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful
Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;</p>
<p>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes
Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,
That is one person only in two natures.</p>
<p>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,
She seemed to me far more her ancient self
To excel, than others here, when she was here.</p>
<p>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,
That of all other things the one which turned me
Most to its love became the most my foe.</p>
<p>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart
O&#x27;erpowered I fell, and what I then became
She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.</p>
<p>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,
The lady I had found alone, above me
I saw, and she was saying, &quot;Hold me, hold me.&quot;</p>
<p>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,
And, dragging me behind her, she was moving
Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.</p>
<p>When I was near unto the blessed shore,
&quot;Asperges me,&quot; I heard so sweetly sung,
Remember it I cannot, much less write it.</p>
<p>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,
Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,
Where I was forced to swallow of the water.</p>
<p>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought
Into the dance of the four beautiful,
And each one with her arm did cover me.</p>
<p>&#x27;We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;
Ere Beatrice descended to the world,
We as her handmaids were appointed her.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant
Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine
The three beyond, who more profoundly look.&#x27;</p>
<p>Thus singing they began; and afterwards
Unto the Griffin&#x27;s breast they led me with them,
Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.</p>
<p>&quot;See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,&quot; they said;
&quot;Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,
Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,
Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,
That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.</p>
<p>As in a glass the sun, not otherwise
Within them was the twofold monster shining,
Now with the one, now with the other nature.</p>
<p>Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,
When I beheld the thing itself stand still,
And in its image it transformed itself.</p>
<p>While with amazement filled and jubilant,
My soul was tasting of the food, that while
It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,</p>
<p>Themselves revealing of the highest rank
In bearing, did the other three advance,
Singing to their angelic saraband.</p>
<p>&quot;Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,&quot;
Such was their song, &quot;unto thy faithful one,
Who has to see thee ta&#x27;en so many steps.</p>
<p>In grace do us the grace that thou unveil
Thy face to him, so that he may discern
The second beauty which thou dost conceal.&quot;</p>
<p>O splendour of the living light eternal!
Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus
Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,</p>
<p>He would not seem to have his mind encumbered
Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,
Where the harmonious heaven o&#x27;ershadowed thee,</p>
<p>When in the open air thou didst unveil?</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXXII</p>
<p>So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes
In satisfying their decennial thirst,
That all my other senses were extinct,</p>
<p>And upon this side and on that they had
Walls of indifference, so the holy smile
Drew them unto itself with the old net</p>
<p>When forcibly my sight was turned away
Towards my left hand by those goddesses,
Because I heard from them a &quot;Too intently!&quot;</p>
<p>And that condition of the sight which is
In eyes but lately smitten by the sun
Bereft me of my vision some short while;</p>
<p>But to the less when sight re-shaped itself,
I say the less in reference to the greater
Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,</p>
<p>I saw upon its right wing wheeled about
The glorious host returning with the sun
And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.</p>
<p>As underneath its shields, to save itself,
A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,
Before the whole thereof can change its front,</p>
<p>That soldiery of the celestial kingdom
Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us
Before the chariot had turned its pole.</p>
<p>Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,
And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,
But so that not a feather of him fluttered.</p>
<p>The lady fair who drew me through the ford
Followed with Statius and myself the wheel
Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.</p>
<p>So passing through the lofty forest, vacant
By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,
Angelic music made our steps keep time.</p>
<p>Perchance as great a space had in three flights
An arrow loosened from the string o&#x27;erpassed,
As we had moved when Beatrice descended.</p>
<p>I heard them murmur altogether, &quot;Adam!&quot;
Then circled they about a tree despoiled
Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.</p>
<p>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate
As higher they ascend, had been by Indians
Among their forests marvelled at for height.</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not
Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,
Since appetite by this was turned to evil.&quot;</p>
<p>After this fashion round the tree robust
The others shouted; and the twofold creature:
&quot;Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.&quot;</p>
<p>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,
He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,
And what was of it unto it left bound.</p>
<p>In the same manner as our trees (when downward
Falls the great light, with that together mingled
Which after the celestial Lasca shines)</p>
<p>Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,
Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun
Harness his steeds beneath another star:</p>
<p>Less than of rose and more than violet
A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree
That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.</p>
<p>I never heard, nor here below is sung,
The hymn which afterward that people sang,
Nor did I bear the melody throughout.</p>
<p>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep
Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,
Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,</p>
<p>Even as a painter who from model paints
I would portray how I was lulled asleep;
He may, who well can picture drowsihood.</p>
<p>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,
And say a splendour rent from me the veil
Of slumber, and a calling: &quot;Rise, what dost thou?&quot;</p>
<p>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom
Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,
And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,</p>
<p>Peter and John and James conducted were,
And, overcome, recovered at the word
By which still greater slumbers have been broken,</p>
<p>And saw their school diminished by the loss
Not only of Elias, but of Moses,
And the apparel of their Master changed;</p>
<p>So I revived, and saw that piteous one
Above me standing, who had been conductress
Aforetime of my steps beside the river,</p>
<p>And all in doubt I said, &quot;Where&#x27;s Beatrice?&quot;
And she: &quot;Behold her seated underneath
The leafage new, upon the root of it.</p>
<p>Behold the company that circles her;
The rest behind the Griffin are ascending
With more melodious song, and more profound.&quot;</p>
<p>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,
Because already in my sight was she
Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.</p>
<p>Alone she sat upon the very earth,
Left there as guardian of the chariot
Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.</p>
<p>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves
The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands
Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.</p>
<p>&quot;Short while shalt thou be here a forester,
And thou shalt be with me for evermore
A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.</p>
<p>Therefore, for that world&#x27;s good which liveth ill,
Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,
Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet
Of her commandments all devoted was,
My mind and eyes directed where she willed.</p>
<p>Never descended with so swift a motion
Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining
From out the region which is most remote,</p>
<p>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend
Down through the tree, rending away the bark,
As well as blossoms and the foliage new,</p>
<p>And he with all his might the chariot smote,
Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest
Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.</p>
<p>Thereafter saw I leap into the body
Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,
That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.</p>
<p>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,
My Lady put him to as swift a flight
As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.</p>
<p>Then by the way that it before had come,
Into the chariot&#x27;s chest I saw the Eagle
Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.</p>
<p>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,
A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:
&quot;My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!&quot;</p>
<p>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between
Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,
Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,</p>
<p>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,
Drawing unto himself his tail malign,
Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.</p>
<p>That which remained behind, even as with grass
A fertile region, with the feathers, offered
Perhaps with pure intention and benign,</p>
<p>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed
The pole and both the wheels so speedily,
A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.</p>
<p>Transfigured thus the holy edifice
Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,
Three on the pole and one at either corner.</p>
<p>The first were horned like oxen; but the four
Had but a single horn upon the forehead;
A monster such had never yet been seen!</p>
<p>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,
Seated upon it, there appeared to me
A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,</p>
<p>And, as if not to have her taken from him,
Upright beside her I beheld a giant;
And ever and anon they kissed each other.</p>
<p>But because she her wanton, roving eye
Turned upon me, her angry paramour
Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.</p>
<p>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,
He loosed the monster, and across the forest
Dragged it so far, he made of that alone</p>
<p>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</p>
<p>Purgatorio: Canto XXXIII</p>
<p>&quot;Deus venerunt gentes,&quot; alternating
Now three, now four, melodious psalmody
The maidens in the midst of tears began;</p>
<p>And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,
Listened to them with such a countenance,
That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.</p>
<p>But when the other virgins place had given
For her to speak, uprisen to her feet
With colour as of fire, she made response:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Modicum, et non videbitis me;
Et iterum,&#x27; my sisters predilect,
&#x27;Modicum, et vos videbitis me.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Then all the seven in front of her she placed;
And after her, by beckoning only, moved
Me and the lady and the sage who stayed.</p>
<p>So she moved onward; and I do not think
That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,
When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote,</p>
<p>And with a tranquil aspect, &quot;Come more quickly,&quot;
To me she said, &quot;that, if I speak with thee,
To listen to me thou mayst be well placed.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as I was with her as I should be,
She said to me: &quot;Why, brother, dost thou not
Venture to question now, in coming with me?&quot;</p>
<p>As unto those who are too reverential,
Speaking in presence of superiors,
Who drag no living utterance to their teeth,</p>
<p>It me befell, that without perfect sound
Began I: &quot;My necessity, Madonna,
You know, and that which thereunto is good.&quot;</p>
<p>And she to me: &quot;Of fear and bashfulness
Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself,
So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.</p>
<p>Know that the vessel which the serpent broke
Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty
Think that God&#x27;s vengeance does not fear a sop.</p>
<p>Without an heir shall not for ever be
The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,
Whence it became a monster, then a prey;</p>
<p>For verily I see, and hence narrate it,
The stars already near to bring the time,
From every hindrance safe, and every bar,</p>
<p>Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,
One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman
And that same giant who is sinning with her.</p>
<p>And peradventure my dark utterance,
Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,
Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;</p>
<p>But soon the facts shall be the Naiades
Who shall this difficult enigma solve,
Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.</p>
<p>Note thou; and even as by me are uttered
These words, so teach them unto those who live
That life which is a running unto death;</p>
<p>And bear in mind, whene&#x27;er thou writest them,
Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,
That twice already has been pillaged here.</p>
<p>Whoever pillages or shatters it,
With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,
Who made it holy for his use alone.</p>
<p>For biting that, in pain and in desire
Five thousand years and more the first-born soul
Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.</p>
<p>Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not
For special reason so pre-eminent
In height, and so inverted in its summit.</p>
<p>And if thy vain imaginings had not been
Water of Elsa round about thy mind,
And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,</p>
<p>Thou by so many circumstances only
The justice of the interdict of God
Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.</p>
<p>But since I see thee in thine intellect
Converted into stone and stained with sin,
So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,</p>
<p>I will too, if not written, at least painted,
Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason
That cinct with palm the pilgrim&#x27;s staff is borne.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;As by a signet is the wax
Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,
My brain is now imprinted by yourself.</p>
<p>But wherefore so beyond my power of sight
Soars your desirable discourse, that aye
The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That thou mayst recognize,&quot; she said, &quot;the school
Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far
Its doctrine follows after my discourse,</p>
<p>And mayst behold your path from the divine
Distant as far as separated is
From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.&quot;</p>
<p>Whence her I answered: &quot;I do not remember
That ever I estranged myself from you,
Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if thou art not able to remember,&quot;
Smiling she answered, &quot;recollect thee now
That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;</p>
<p>And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,
Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates
Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.</p>
<p>Truly from this time forward shall my words
Be naked, so far as it is befitting
To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.&quot;</p>
<p>And more coruscant and with slower steps
The sun was holding the meridian circle,
Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there</p>
<p>When halted (as he cometh to a halt,
Who goes before a squadron as its escort,
If something new he find upon his way)</p>
<p>The ladies seven at a dark shadow&#x27;s edge,
Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,
The Alp upon its frigid border wears.</p>
<p>In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates
Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,
And slowly part, like friends, from one another.</p>
<p>&quot;O light, O glory of the human race!
What stream is this which here unfolds itself
From out one source, and from itself withdraws?&quot;</p>
<p>For such a prayer, &#x27;twas said unto me, &quot;Pray
Matilda that she tell thee;&quot; and here answered,
As one does who doth free himself from blame,</p>
<p>The beautiful lady: &quot;This and other things
Were told to him by me; and sure I am
The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.&quot;</p>
<p>And Beatrice: &quot;Perhaps a greater care,
Which oftentimes our memory takes away,
Has made the vision of his mind obscure.</p>
<p>But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;
Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,
Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.&quot;</p>
<p>Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,
But makes its own will of another&#x27;s will
As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,</p>
<p>Even so, when she had taken hold of me,
The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius
Said, in her womanly manner, &quot;Come with him.&quot;</p>
<p>If, Reader, I possessed a longer space
For writing it, I yet would sing in part
Of the sweet draught that ne&#x27;er would satiate me;</p>
<p>But inasmuch as full are all the leaves
Made ready for this second canticle,
The curb of art no farther lets me go.</p>
<p>From the most holy water I returned
Regenerate, in the manner of new trees
That are renewed with a new foliage,</p>
<p>Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a
