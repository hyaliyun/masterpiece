<p>REMARKS ON THE BATTLE.</p>
<p>While occupying the ground between Clifton and Berryville, referred</p>
<p>to in the last chapter of the preceding volume, I felt the need of an</p>
<p>efficient body of scouts to collect information regarding the enemy,</p>
<p>for the defective intelligence-establishment with which I started out</p>
<p>from Harper&#x27;s Ferry early in August had not proved satisfactory.  I</p>
<p>therefore began to organize my scouts on a system which I hoped would</p>
<p>give better results than bad the method hitherto pursued in the</p>
<p>department, which was to employ on this service doubtful citizens and</p>
<p>Confederate deserters.  If these should turn out untrustworthy, the</p>
<p>mischief they might do us gave me grave apprehension, and I finally</p>
<p>concluded that those of our own soldiers who should volunteer for the</p>
<p>delicate and hazardous duty would be the most valuable material, and</p>
<p>decided that they should have a battalion organization and be</p>
<p>commanded by an officer, Major H. K. Young, of the First Rhode Island</p>
<p>Infantry.  These men were disguised in Confederate uniforms whenever</p>
<p>necessary, were paid from the Secret-Service Fund in proportion to</p>
<p>the value of the intelligence they furnished, which often stood us in</p>
<p>good stead in checking the forays of Gilmore, Mosby, and other</p>
<p>irregulars.  Beneficial results came from the plan in many other ways</p>
<p>too, and particularly so when in a few days two of my scouts put me</p>
<p>in the way of getting news conveyed from Winchester.  They had</p>
<p>learned that just outside of my lines, near Millwood, there was</p>
<p>living an old colored man, who had a permit from the Confederate</p>
<p>commander to go into Winchester and return three times a week, for</p>
<p>the purpose of selling vegetables to the inhabitants.  The scouts had</p>
<p>sounded this man, and, finding him both loyal and shrewd, suggested</p>
<p>that he might be made useful to us within the enemy&#x27;s lines; and the</p>
<p>proposal struck me as feasible, provided there could be found in</p>
<p>Winchester some reliable person who would be willing to co-operate</p>
<p>and correspond with me.  I asked General Crook, who was acquainted</p>
<p>with many of the Union people of Winchester, if he knew of such a</p>
<p>person, and he recommended a Miss Rebecca Wright, a young lady whom</p>
<p>he had met there before the battle of Kernstown, who, he said, was a</p>
<p>member of the Society of Friends and the teacher of a small private</p>
<p>school.  He knew she was faithful and loyal to the Government, and</p>
<p>thought she might be willing to render us assistance, but he could</p>
<p>not be certain of this, for on account of her well known loyalty she</p>
<p>was under constant surveillance.  I hesitated at first, but finally</p>
<p>deciding to try it, despatched the two scouts to the old negro&#x27;s</p>
<p>cabin, and they brought him to my headquarters late that night.  I</p>
<p>was soon convinced of the negro&#x27;s fidelity, and asking him if he was</p>
<p>acquainted with Miss Rebecca Wright, of Winchester, he replied that</p>
<p>he knew her well.  There upon I told him what I wished to do, and</p>
<p>after a little persuasion he agreed to carry a letter to her on his</p>
<p>next marketing trip.  My message was prepared by writing it on tissue</p>
<p>paper, which was then compressed into a small pellet, and protected</p>
<p>by wrapping it in tin-foil so that it could be safely carried in the</p>
<p>man&#x27;s mouth.  The probability, of his being searched when he came to</p>
<p>the Confederate picket-line was not remote, and in such event he was</p>
<p>to swallow the pellet.  The letter appealed to Miss Wright&#x27;s loyalty</p>
<p>and patriotism, and requested her to furnish me with information</p>
<p>regarding the strength and condition of Early&#x27;s army.  The night</p>
<p>before the negro started one of the scouts placed the odd-looking</p>
<p>communication in his hands, with renewed injunctions as to secrecy</p>
<p>and promptitude.  Early the next morning it was delivered to Miss</p>
<p>Wright, with an intimation that a letter of importance was enclosed</p>
<p>in the tin-foil, the negro telling her at the same time that she</p>
<p>might expect him to call for a message in reply before his return</p>
<p>home.  At first Miss Wright began to open the pellet nervously, but</p>
<p>when told to be careful, and to preserve the foil as a wrapping for</p>
<p>her answer, she proceeded slowly and carefully, and when the note</p>
<p>appeared intact the messenger retired, remarking again that in the</p>
<p>evening he would come for an answer.</p>
<p>On reading my communication Miss Wright was much startled by the</p>
<p>perils it involved, and hesitatingly consulted her mother, but her</p>
<p>devoted loyalty soon silenced every other consideration, and the</p>
<p>brave girl resolved to comply with my request, notwithstanding it</p>
<p>might jeopardize her life.  The evening before a convalescent</p>
<p>Confederate officer had visited her mother&#x27;s house, and in</p>
<p>conversation about the war had disclosed the fact that Kershaw&#x27;s</p>
<p>division of infantry and Cutshaw&#x27;s battalion of artillery had started</p>
<p>to rejoin General Lee.  At the time Miss Wright heard this she</p>
<p>attached little if any importance to it, but now she perceived the</p>
<p>value of the intelligence, and, as her first venture, determined to</p>
<p>send it to me at once, which she did with a promise that in the</p>
<p>future she would with great pleasure continue to transmit information</p>
<p>by the negro messenger.</p>
<p>&quot;SEPTEMBER 15, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;I learn from Major-General Crook that you are a loyal lady, and</p>
<p>still love the old flag.  Can you inform me of the position of</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s forces, the number of divisions in his army, and the strength</p>
<p>of any or all of them, and his probable or reported intentions?  Have</p>
<p>any more troops arrived from Richmond, or are any more coming, or</p>
<p>reported to be coming?</p>
<p>&quot;You can trust the bearer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General Commanding.</p>
<p>&quot;SEPTEMBER 16, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no communication whatever with the rebels, but will tell you</p>
<p>what I know.  The division of General Kershaw, and Cutshaw&#x27;s</p>
<p>artillery, twelve guns and men, General Anderson commanding, have</p>
<p>been sent away, and no more are expected, as they cannot be spared</p>
<p>from Richmond.  I do not know how the troops are situated, but the</p>
<p>force is much smaller than represented.  I will take pleasure</p>
<p>hereafter in learning all I can of their strength and position, and</p>
<p>the bearer may call again.</p>
<p>&quot;Very respectfully yours,</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>Miss Wright&#x27;s answer proved of more value to me than she anticipated,</p>
<p>for it not only quieted the conflicting reports concerning Anderson&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps, but was most important in showing positively that Kershaw was</p>
<p>gone, and this circumstance led, three days later, to the battle of</p>
<p>the Opequon, or Winchester as it has been unofficially called.  Word</p>
<p>to the effect that some of Early&#x27;s troops were under orders to return</p>
<p>to Petersburg, and would start back at the first favorable</p>
<p>opportunity, had been communicated to me already from many sources,</p>
<p>but we had not been able to ascertain the date for their departure.</p>
<p>Now that they had actually started, I decided to wait before offering</p>
<p>battle until Kershaw had gone so far as to preclude his return,</p>
<p>feeling confident that my prudence would be justified by the improved</p>
<p>chances of victory; and then, besides, Mr. Stanton kept reminding me</p>
<p>that positive success was necessary to counteract the political</p>
<p>dissatisfaction existing in some of the Northern States.  This course</p>
<p>was advised and approved by General Grant, but even with his powerful</p>
<p>backing it was difficult to resist the persistent pressure of those</p>
<p>whose judgment, warped by their interests in the Baltimore and Ohio</p>
<p>railroad, was often confused and misled by stories of scouts (sent</p>
<p>out from Washington), averring that Kershaw and Fitzhugh Lee had</p>
<p>returned to Petersburg, Breckenridge to southwestern Virginia, and at</p>
<p>one time even maintaining that Early&#x27;s whole army was east of the</p>
<p>Blue Ridge, and its commander himself at Gordonsville.</p>
<p>During the inactivity prevailing in my army for the ten days</p>
<p>preceding Miss Wright&#x27;s communication the infantry was quiet, with</p>
<p>the exception of Getty&#x27;s division, which made a reconnoissance to the</p>
<p>Opequon, and developed a heavy force of the enemy at Edwards&#x27;s</p>
<p>Corners.  The cavalry, however, was employed a good deal in this</p>
<p>interval skirmishing heavily at times to maintain a space about six</p>
<p>miles in width between the hostile lines, for I wished to control</p>
<p>this ground so that when I was released from the instructions of</p>
<p>August 12, I could move my men into position for attack without the</p>
<p>knowledge of Early.  The most noteworthy of these mounted encounters</p>
<p>was that of McIntosh&#x27;s brigade, which captured the Eighth South</p>
<p>Carolina at Abraham&#x27;s Creek September 13.</p>
<p>It was the evening of the 16th of September that I received from Miss</p>
<p>Wright the positive information that Kershaw was in march toward</p>
<p>Front Royal on his way by Chester Gap to Richmond.  Concluding that</p>
<p>this was my opportunity, I at once resolved to throw my whole force</p>
<p>into Newtown the next day, but a despatch from General Grant</p>
<p>directing me to meet him at Charlestown, whither he was coming to</p>
<p>consult with me, caused me to defer action until after I should see</p>
<p>him.  In our resulting interview at Charlestown, I went over the</p>
<p>situation very thoroughly, and pointed out with so much confidence</p>
<p>the chances of a complete victory should I throw my army across the</p>
<p>Valley pike near Newtown that he fell in with the plan at once,</p>
<p>authorized me to resume the offensive, and to attack Early as soon as</p>
<p>I deemed it most propitious to do so; and although before leaving</p>
<p>City Point he had outlined certain operations for my army, yet he</p>
<p>neither discussed nor disclosed his plans, my knowledge of the</p>
<p>situation striking him as being so much more accurate than his own.</p>
<p>[Extract from Grant&#x27;s Memoirs,&quot; page 328.]</p>
<p>&quot;....Before starting I had drawn up a plan of campaign for Sheridan,</p>
<p>which I had brought with me; but seeing that he was so clear and so</p>
<p>positive in his views, and so confident of success, I said nothing</p>
<p>about this, and did not take it out of my pocket....&quot;</p>
<p>The interview over, I returned to my army to arrange for its movement</p>
<p>toward Newtown, but while busy with these preparations, a report came</p>
<p>to me from General Averell which showed that Early was moving with</p>
<p>two divisions of infantry toward Martinsburg.  This considerably</p>
<p>altered the state of affairs, and I now decided to change my plan and</p>
<p>attack at once the two divisions remaining about Winchester and</p>
<p>Stephenson&#x27;s depot, and later, the two sent to Martinsburg; the</p>
<p>disjointed state of the enemy giving me an opportunity to take him in</p>
<p>detail, unless the Martinsburg column should be returned by forced</p>
<p>marches.</p>
<p>While General Early was in the telegraph office at Martinsburg on the</p>
<p>morning of the 18th, he learned of Grant&#x27;s visit to me; and</p>
<p>anticipating activity by reason of this circumstance, he promptly</p>
<p>proceeded to withdraw so as to get the two divisions within</p>
<p>supporting distance of Ramseur&#x27;s, which lay across the Berryville</p>
<p>pike about two miles east of Winchester, between Abraham&#x27;s Creek and</p>
<p>Red Bud Run, so by the night of the 18th Wharton&#x27;s division, under</p>
<p>Breckenridge, was at Stephenson&#x27;s depot, Rodes near there, and</p>
<p>Gordon&#x27;s at Bunker Hill.  At daylight of the 19th these positions of</p>
<p>the Confederate infantry still obtained, with the cavalry of Lomax,</p>
<p>Jackson, and Johnson on the right of Ramseur, while to the left and</p>
<p>rear of the enemy;s general line was Fitzhugh Lee, covering from</p>
<p>Stephenson&#x27;s depot west across the Valley pike to Applepie Ridge.</p>
<p>My army moved at 3 o&#x27;clock that morning.  The plan was for Torbert to</p>
<p>advance with Merritt&#x27;s division of cavalry from Summit Point, carry</p>
<p>the crossings of the Opequon at Stevens&#x27;s and Lock&#x27;s fords, and form</p>
<p>a junction near Stephenson&#x27;s depot, with Averell, who was to move</p>
<p>south from Darksville by the Valley pike.  Meanwhile, Wilson was to</p>
<p>strike up the Berryville pike, carry the Berryville crossing of the</p>
<p>Opequon, charge through the gorge or canyon on the road west of the</p>
<p>stream, and occupy the open ground at the head of this defile.</p>
<p>Wilson&#x27;s attack was to be supported by the Sixth and Nineteenth</p>
<p>corps, which were ordered to the Berryville crossing, and as the</p>
<p>cavalry gained the open ground beyond the gorge, the two infantry</p>
<p>corps, under command of General Wright, were expected to press on</p>
<p>after and occupy Wilson&#x27;s ground, who was then to shift to the south</p>
<p>bank of Abraham&#x27;s Creek and cover my left; Crook&#x27;s two divisions,</p>
<p>having to march from Summit Point, were to follow the Sixth and</p>
<p>Nineteenth corps to the Opcquon, and should they arrive before the</p>
<p>action began, they were to be held in reserve till the proper moment</p>
<p>came, and then, as a turning-column, be thrown over toward the Valley</p>
<p>pike, south of Winchester.</p>
<p>McIntosh&#x27;s brigade of Wilson&#x27;s division drove the enemy&#x27;s pickets</p>
<p>away from the Berryville crossing at dawn, and Wilson following</p>
<p>rapidly through the gorge with the rest of the division, debouched</p>
<p>from its western extremity with such suddenness as to capture a small</p>
<p>earthwork in front of General Ramseur&#x27;s main line; and not-</p>
<p>withstanding the Confederate infantry, on recovering from its</p>
<p>astonishment, tried hard to dislodge them, Wilson&#x27;s troopers</p>
<p>obstinately held the work till the Sixth Corps came up.  I followed</p>
<p>Wilson to select the ground on which to form the infantry.  The Sixth</p>
<p>Corps began to arrive about 8 o&#x27;clock, and taking up the line Wilson</p>
<p>had been holding, just beyond the head of the narrow ravine, the</p>
<p>cavalry was transferred to the south side of Abraham&#x27;s Creek.</p>
<p>The Confederate line lay along some elevated ground about two miles</p>
<p>east of Winchester, and extended from Abraham&#x27;s Creek north across</p>
<p>the Berryville pike, the left being hidden in the heavy timber on Red</p>
<p>Bud Run.  Between this line and mine, especially on my right, clumps</p>
<p>of woods and patches of underbrush occurred here and there, but the</p>
<p>undulating ground consisted mainly of open fields, many of which were</p>
<p>covered with standing corn that had already ripened.</p>
<p>Much time was lost in getting all of the Sixth and Nineteenth corps</p>
<p>through the narrow defile, Grover&#x27;s division being greatly delayed</p>
<p>there by a train of ammunition wagons, and it was not until late in</p>
<p>the forenoon that the troops intended for the attack could be got</p>
<p>into line ready to advance.  General Early was not slow to avail</p>
<p>himself of the advantages thus offered him, and my chances of</p>
<p>striking him in detail were growing less every moment, for Gordon and</p>
<p>Rodes were hurrying their divisions from Stephenson&#x27;s depot--across-</p>
<p>country on a line that would place Gordon in the woods south of Red</p>
<p>Bud Run, and bring Rodes into the interval between Gordon and</p>
<p>Ramseur.</p>
<p>When the two corps had all got through the canyon they were formed</p>
<p>with Getty&#x27;s division of the Sixth to the left of the Berryville</p>
<p>pike, Rickett&#x27;s division to the right of the pike, and Russell&#x27;s</p>
<p>division in reserve in rear of the other two.  Grover&#x27;s division of</p>
<p>the Nineteenth Corps came next on the right of Rickett&#x27;s, with Dwight</p>
<p>to its rear in reserve, while Crook was to begin massing near the</p>
<p>Opequon crossing about the time Wright and Emory were ready to</p>
<p>attack.</p>
<p>Just before noon the line of Getty, Ricketts, and Grover moved</p>
<p>forward, and as we advanced, the Confederates, covered by some heavy</p>
<p>woods on their right, slight underbrush and corn-fields along their</p>
<p>Centre, and a large body of timber on their left along the Red Bud,</p>
<p>opened fire from their whole front.  We gained considerable ground at</p>
<p>first, especially on our left but the desperate resistance which the</p>
<p>right met with demonstrated that the time we had unavoidably lost in</p>
<p>the morning had been of incalculable value to Early, for it was</p>
<p>evident that he had been enabled already to so far concentrate his</p>
<p>troops as to have the different divisions of his army in a connected</p>
<p>line of battle, in good shape to resist.</p>
<p>Getty and Ricketts made some progress toward Winchester in connection</p>
<p>with Wilson&#x27;s cavalry, which was beyond the Senseny road on Getty&#x27;s</p>
<p>left, and as they were pressing back Ramseur&#x27;s infantry and Lomax&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry Grover attacked from the right with decided effect.  Grover</p>
<p>in a few minutes broke up Evans&#x27;s brigade of Gordon&#x27;s division, but</p>
<p>his pursuit of Evans destroyed the continuity of my general line, and</p>
<p>increased an interval that had already been made by the deflection of</p>
<p>Ricketts to the 1eft, in obedience to instructions that had been</p>
<p>given him to guide his division on the Berryville pike.  As the line</p>
<p>pressed forward, Ricketts observed this widening interval and</p>
<p>endeavored to fill it with the small brigade of Colonel Keifer, but</p>
<p>at this juncture both Gordon and Rodes struck the weak spot where the</p>
<p>right of the Sixth Corps and the left of the Nineteenth should have</p>
<p>been in conjunction, and succeeded in checking my advance by driving</p>
<p>back a part of Ricketts&#x27;s division, and the most of Grover&#x27;s.  As</p>
<p>these troops were retiring I ordered Russell&#x27;s reserve division to be</p>
<p>put into action, and just as the flank of the enemy&#x27;s troops in</p>
<p>pursuit of Grover was presented, Upton&#x27;s brigade, led in person by</p>
<p>both Russell and Upton, struck it in a charge so vigorous as to drive</p>
<p>the Confederates back in turn to their original ground.</p>
<p>The success of Russell enabled me to re-establish the right of my</p>
<p>line some little distance in advance of the position from which it</p>
<p>started in the morning, and behind Russell&#x27;s division (now commanded</p>
<p>by Upton) the broken regiments of Ricketts&#x27;s division were rallied.</p>
<p>Dwight&#x27;s division was then brought up on the right, and Grover&#x27;s men</p>
<p>formed behind it.</p>
<p>The charge of Russell was most opportune, but it cost many men in</p>
<p>killed and wounded.  Among the former was the courageous Russell</p>
<p>himself; killed by a piece of shell that passed through his heart,</p>
<p>although he had previously been struck by a bullet in the left</p>
<p>breast, which wound, from its nature, must have proved mortal, yet of</p>
<p>which he had not spoken.  Russell&#x27;s death oppressed us all with</p>
<p>sadness, and me particularly.  In the early days of my army life he</p>
<p>was my captain and friend, and I was deeply indebted to him, not only</p>
<p>for sound advice and good example, but for the inestimable service he</p>
<p>had just performed, and sealed with his life, so it may be inferred</p>
<p>how keenly I felt his loss.</p>
<p>As my lines were being rearranged, it was suggested to me to put</p>
<p>Crook into the battle, but so strongly had I set my heart on using</p>
<p>him to take possession of the Valley pike and cut off the enemy, that</p>
<p>I resisted this advice, hoping that the necessity for putting him in</p>
<p>would be obviated by the attack near Stephenson&#x27;s depot that</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s cavalry was to make, and from which I was momentarily</p>
<p>expecting to hear.  No news of Torbert&#x27;s progress came, however, so,</p>
<p>yielding at last, I directed Crook to take post on the right of the</p>
<p>Nineteenth Corps and, when the action was renewed, to push his</p>
<p>command forward as a turning-column in conjunction with Emory.  After</p>
<p>some delay in the annoying defile, Crook got his men up, and posting</p>
<p>Colonel Thoburn&#x27;s division on the prolongation of the Nineteenth</p>
<p>Corps, he formed Colonel Duval&#x27;s division to the right of Thoburn.</p>
<p>Here I joined Crook, informing him that I had just got word that</p>
<p>Torbert was driving the enemy in confusion along the Martinsburg pike</p>
<p>toward Winchester; at the same time I directed him to attack the</p>
<p>moment all of Duval&#x27;s men were in line.  Wright was instructed to</p>
<p>advance in concert with Crook, by swinging Emory and the right of the</p>
<p>Sixth Corps to the left together in a half-wheel.  Then leaving</p>
<p>Crook, I rode along the Sixth and Nineteenth corps, the open ground</p>
<p>over which they were passing affording a rare opportunity to witness</p>
<p>the precision with which the attack was taken up from right to left.</p>
<p>Crook&#x27;s success began the moment he started to turn the enemy&#x27;s left;</p>
<p>and assured by the fact that Torbert had stampeded the Confederate</p>
<p>cavalry and thrown Breckenridge&#x27;s infantry into such disorder that it</p>
<p>could do little to prevent the envelopment of Gordon&#x27;s left, Crook</p>
<p>pressed forward without even a halt.</p>
<p>Both Emory and Wright took up the fight as ordered, and as they did</p>
<p>so I sent word to Wilson, in the hope that he could partly perform</p>
<p>the work originally laid out for Crook, to push along the Senseny</p>
<p>road and, if possible, gain the valley pike south of Winchester.  I</p>
<p>then returned toward my right flank, and as I reached the Nineteenth</p>
<p>Corps the enemy was contesting the ground in its front with great</p>
<p>obstinacy; but Emory&#x27;s dogged persistence was at length rewarded with</p>
<p>success, just as Crook&#x27;s command emerged from the morass of Red Bud</p>
<p>Run, and swept around Gordon, toward the right of Breckenridge, who,</p>
<p>with two of Wharton&#x27;s brigades, was holding a line at right angles</p>
<p>with the Valley pike for the protection of the Confederate rear.</p>
<p>Early had ordered these two brigades back from Stephenson&#x27;s depot in</p>
<p>the morning, purposing to protect with them his right flank and line</p>
<p>of retreat, but while they were en route to this end, he was obliged</p>
<p>to recall them to his left to meet Crook&#x27;s attack.</p>
<p>To confront Torbert, Patton&#x27;s brigade of infantry and some of</p>
<p>Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry had been left back by Breckenridge, but, with</p>
<p>Averell on the west side of the Valley pike and Merritt on the east,</p>
<p>Torbert began to drive this opposing force toward Winchester the</p>
<p>moment he struck it near Stephenson&#x27;s depot, keeping it on the go</p>
<p>till it reached the position held by Breckenridge, where it</p>
<p>endeavored to make a stand.</p>
<p>The ground which Breckenridge was holding was open, and offered an</p>
<p>opportunity such as seldom had been presented during the war for a,</p>
<p>mounted attack, and Torbert was not slow to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>The instant Merritt&#x27;s division could be formed for the charge, it</p>
<p>went at Breckenridge&#x27;s infantry and Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry with such</p>
<p>momentum as to break the Confederate left, just as Averell was</p>
<p>passing around it.  Merritt&#x27;s brigades, led by Custer, Lowell, and</p>
<p>Devin, met from the start with pronounced success, and with sabre or</p>
<p>pistol in hand literally rode down a battery of five guns and took</p>
<p>about 1,200 prisoners.  Almost simultaneously with this cavalry</p>
<p>charge, Crook struck Breckenridge&#x27;s right and Gordon&#x27;s left, forcing</p>
<p>these divisions to give way, and as they retired, Wright, in a</p>
<p>vigorous attack, quickly broke Rodes up and pressed Ramseur so hard</p>
<p>that the whole Confederate army fell back, contracting its lines</p>
<p>within some breastworks which had been thrown up at a former period</p>
<p>of the war, immediately in front of Winchester.</p>
<p>Here Early tried hard to stem the tide, but soon Torbert&#x27;s cavalry</p>
<p>began passing around his left flank, and as Crook, Emory, and Wright</p>
<p>attacked in front, panic took possession of the enemy, his troops,</p>
<p>now fugitives and stragglers, seeking escape into and through</p>
<p>Winchester.</p>
<p>When this second break occurred, the Sixth and Nineteenth corps were</p>
<p>moved over toward the Millwood pike to help Wilson on the left, but</p>
<p>the day was so far spent that they could render him no assistance,</p>
<p>and Ramseur&#x27;s division, which had maintained some organization, was</p>
<p>in such tolerable shape as to check him.  Meanwhile Torbert passed</p>
<p>around to the west of Winchester to join Wilson, but was unable to do</p>
<p>so till after dark.  Crook&#x27;s command pursued the enemy through the</p>
<p>town to Mill Greek, I going along.</p>
<p>Just after entering the town, Crook and I met, in the main street,</p>
<p>three young girls, who gave us the most hearty reception.  One of</p>
<p>these young women was a Miss Griffith, the other two Miss Jennie and</p>
<p>Miss Susie Meredith.  During the day they had been watching the</p>
<p>battle from the roof of the Meredith residence, with tears and</p>
<p>lamentations, they said, in the morning when misfortune appeared to</p>
<p>have overtaken the Union troops, but with unbounded exultation when,</p>
<p>later, the, tide set in against the Confederates.  Our presence was,</p>
<p>to them, an assurance of victory, and their delight being</p>
<p>irrepressible, they indulged in the most unguarded manifestations and</p>
<p>expressions.  When cautioned by Crook, who knew them well, and</p>
<p>reminded that the valley had hitherto been a race-course--one day in</p>
<p>the&#x27;possession of friends, and the next of enemies--and warned of the</p>
<p>dangers they were incurring by such demonstrations, they assured him</p>
<p>that they had no further fears of that kind now, adding that Early&#x27;s</p>
<p>army was so demoralized by the defeat it had just sustained that it</p>
<p>would never be in condition to enter Winchester again.  As soon as we</p>
<p>had succeeded in calming the excited girls a little I expressed a</p>
<p>desire to find some place where I could write a telegram to General</p>
<p>Grant informing him of the result of the battle, and General Crook</p>
<p>conducted me to the home of Miss Wright, where I met for the first</p>
<p>time the woman who had contributed so much to our success, and on a</p>
<p>desk in her school-room wrote the despatch announcing that we had</p>
<p>sent Early&#x27;s army whirling up the valley.</p>
<p>My losses in the battle of the Opequon were heavy, amounting to about</p>
<p>4,500 killed, wounded, and missing.  Among the killed was General</p>
<p>Russell, commanding a division, and the wounded included Generals</p>
<p>Upton, McIntosh and Chapman, and Colonels Duval and Sharpe.  The</p>
<p>Confederate loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners about equaled</p>
<p>mine, General Rodes being of the killed, while Generals Fitzhugh Lee</p>
<p>and York were severely wounded.</p>
<p>We captured five pieces of artillery and nine battle-flags.  The</p>
<p>restoration of the lower valley--from the Potomac to Strasburg--to</p>
<p>the control of the Union forces caused great rejoicing in the North,</p>
<p>and relieved the Administration from further solicitude for the</p>
<p>safety of the Maryland and Pennsylvania borders.  The President&#x27;s</p>
<p>appreciation of the victory was expressed in a despatch so like Mr.</p>
<p>Lincoln that I give a facsimile of it to the reader:</p>
<p>[In the handwriting of President Lincoln]</p>
<p>&quot;EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT</p>
<p>&quot;WASHINGTON, Sep.  20, 1864</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN</p>
<p>&quot;WINCHESTER, VA.</p>
<p>&quot;Have just heard of your geat victory.  God bless you all, officers</p>
<p>and men.  Strongly inclined to come up and see you.</p>
<p>&quot;A. LINCOLN</p>
<p>This he supplemented by promoting me to the grade of brigadier-</p>
<p>general in the regular army, and assigning me to the permanent</p>
<p>command of the Middle Military Department, and following that came</p>
<p>warm congratulations from Mr. Stanton and from Generals Grant,</p>
<p>Sherman, and Meade.</p>
<p>The battle was not fought out on the plan in accordance with which</p>
<p>marching orders were issued to my troops, for I then hoped to take</p>
<p>Early in detail, and with Crook&#x27;s force cut off his retreat.  I</p>
<p>adhered to this purpose during the early part of the contest, but was</p>
<p>obliged to abandon the idea because of unavoidable delays by which I</p>
<p>was prevented from getting the Sixth and Nineteenth corps through the</p>
<p>narrow defile and into position early enough to destroy Ramseur while</p>
<p>still isolated.  So much delay had not been anticipated, and this</p>
<p>loss of time was taken advantage of by the enemy to recall the troops</p>
<p>diverted to Bunker Hill and Martinsburg on the 17th, thus enabling</p>
<p>him to bring them all to the support of Ramseur before I could strike</p>
<p>with effect.  My idea was to attack Ramseur and Wharton,</p>
<p>successively, at a very early hour and before they could get succor,</p>
<p>but I was not in condition to do it till nearly noon, by which time</p>
<p>Gordon and Rodes had been enabled to get upon the ground at a point</p>
<p>from which, as I advanced, they enfiladed my right flank, and gave it</p>
<p>such a repulse that to re-form this part of my line I was obliged to</p>
<p>recall the left from some of the ground it had gained.  It was during</p>
<p>this reorganization of my lines that I changed my plan as to Crook,</p>
<p>and moved him from my left to my right.  This I did with great</p>
<p>reluctance, for I hoped to destroy Early&#x27;s army entirely if Crook</p>
<p>continued on his original line of march toward the Valley pike, south</p>
<p>of Winchester; and although the ultimate results did, in a measure</p>
<p>vindicate the change, yet I have always thought that by adhering to</p>
<p>the original plan we might have captured the bulk of Early&#x27;s army.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11.</p>
<p>PURSUING EARLY--A SECRET MARCH--FISHER&#x27;S HILL--A GREAT SUCCESS--</p>
<p>REMOVAL OF AVERELL--THE RETREAT--CAPTURING AN OLD COMRADE--THE MURDER</p>
<p>OF LIEUTENANT MEIGS.</p>
<p>The night of the 19th of September I gave orders for following Early</p>
<p>up the valley next morning--the pursuit to begin at daybreak--and in</p>
<p>obedience to these directions Torbert moved Averell out on the Back</p>
<p>road leading to Cedar Creek, and Merritt up the Valley pike toward</p>
<p>Strasburg, while Wilson was directed on Front Royal by way of</p>
<p>Stevensburg.  Merritt&#x27;s division was followed by the infantry,</p>
<p>Emory&#x27;s and Wright&#x27;s columns marching abreast in the open country to</p>
<p>the right and left of the pike, and Crook&#x27;s immediately behind them.</p>
<p>The enemy having kept up his retreat at night, presented no</p>
<p>opposition whatever until the cavalry discovered him posted at</p>
<p>Fisher&#x27;s Hill, on the first defensive line where he could hope to</p>
<p>make any serious resistance.  No effort was made to dislodge him, and</p>
<p>later in the day, after Wright and Emory came up, Torbert shifted</p>
<p>Merritt over toward the Back road till he rejoined Averell.  As</p>
<p>Merritt moved to the right, the Sixth and Nineteenth corps crossed</p>
<p>Cedar Creek and took up the ground the cavalry was vacating, Wright</p>
<p>posting his own corps to the west of the Valley pike overlooking</p>
<p>Strasburg, and Emory&#x27;s on his left so as to extend almost to the road</p>
<p>leading from Strasburg to Front Royal.  Crook, as he came up the same</p>
<p>evening, went into position in some heavy timber on the north bank of</p>
<p>Cedar Creek.</p>
<p>A reconnoissance made pending these movements convinced me that the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s position at Fisher&#x27;s Hill was so strong that a direct assault</p>
<p>would entail unnecessary destruction of life, and, besides, be of</p>
<p>doubtful result.  At the point where Early&#x27;s troops were in position,</p>
<p>between the Massanutten range and Little North Mountain, the valley</p>
<p>is only about three and a half miles wide.  All along the precipitous</p>
<p>bluff which overhangs Tumbling Run on the south side, a heavy line of</p>
<p>earthworks had been constructed when Early retreated to this point in</p>
<p>August, and these were now being strengthened so as to make them</p>
<p>almost impregnable; in fact, so secure did Early consider himself</p>
<p>that, for convenience, his ammunition chests were taken from the</p>
<p>caissons and placed behind the breastworks.  Wharton, now in command</p>
<p>of Breckenridge&#x27;s division--its late commander having gone to</p>
<p>southwest Virginia--held the right of this line, with Gordon next</p>
<p>him; Pegram, commanding Ramseur&#x27;s old division, joined Gordon.</p>
<p>Ramseur with Rodes&#x27;s division, was on Pegram&#x27;s left, while Lomax&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry, now serving as foot-troops, extended the line to the Back</p>
<p>road.  Fitzhugh Lee being wounded, his cavalry, under General</p>
<p>Wickham, was sent to Milford to prevent Fisher&#x27;s Hill from being</p>
<p>turned through the Luray Valley.</p>
<p>In consequence of the enemy&#x27;s being so well protected from a direct</p>
<p>assault, I resolved on the night of the 20th to use again a turning-</p>
<p>column against his left, as had been done on the 19th at the Opequon.</p>
<p>To this end I resolved to move Crook, unperceived if possible, over</p>
<p>to the eastern face of Little North Mountain, whence he could strike</p>
<p>the left and rear of the Confederate line, and as he broke it up, I</p>
<p>could support him by a left half-wheel of my whole line of battle.</p>
<p>The execution of this plan would require perfect secrecy, however,</p>
<p>for the enemy from his signal-station on Three Top could plainly see</p>
<p>every movement of our troops in daylight.  Hence, to escape such</p>
<p>observation, I marched Crook during the night of the 20th into some</p>
<p>heavy timber north of Cedar Creek, where he lay concealed all day the</p>
<p>21st.  This same day Wright and Emory were moved up closer to the</p>
<p>Confederate works, and the Sixth Corps, after a severe fight, in</p>
<p>which Ricketts&#x27;s and Getty were engaged, took up some high ground on</p>
<p>the right of the Manassas Gap railroad in plain view of the</p>
<p>Confederate works, and confronting a commanding point where much of</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s artillery was massed.  Soon after General Wright had</p>
<p>established this line I rode with him along it to the westward, and</p>
<p>finding that the enemy was still holding an elevated position further</p>
<p>to our right, on the north side of Tumbling Run, I directed this also</p>
<p>to be occupied.  Wright soon carried the point, which gave us an</p>
<p>unobstructed view of the enemy&#x27;s works and offered good ground for</p>
<p>our artillery.  It also enabled me to move the whole of the Sixth</p>
<p>Corps to the front till its line was within about seven hundred yards</p>
<p>of the enemy&#x27;s works; the Nineteenth Corps, on the morning of the</p>
<p>22d, covering the ground vacated by the Sixth by moving to the front</p>
<p>and extending to the right, but still keeping its reserves on the</p>
<p>railroad.</p>
<p>In the darkness of the night of the gist, Crook was brought across</p>
<p>Cedar Creek and hidden in a clump of timber behind Hupp&#x27;s Hill till</p>
<p>daylight of the 22d, when, under cover of the intervening woods and</p>
<p>ravines, he was marched beyond the right of the Sixth Corps and again</p>
<p>concealed not far from the Back road.  After Crook had got into this</p>
<p>last position, Ricketts&#x27;s division was pushed out until it confronted</p>
<p>the left of the enemy&#x27;s infantry, the rest of the Sixth Corps</p>
<p>extending from Ricketts&#x27;s left to the Manassas Gap railroad, while</p>
<p>the Nineteenth Corps filled in the space between the left of the</p>
<p>Sixth and the North Fork of the Shenandoah.</p>
<p>When Ricketts moved out on this new line, in conjunction with</p>
<p>Averell&#x27;s cavalry on his right, the enemy surmising, from information</p>
<p>secured from his signal-station, no doubt, that my attack was to be</p>
<p>made from Ricketts&#x27;s front, prepared for it there, but no such</p>
<p>intention ever existed.  Ricketts was pushed forward only that he</p>
<p>might readily join Crook&#x27;s turning-column as it swung into the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s rear.  To ensure success, all that I needed now was enough</p>
<p>daylight to complete my arrangements, the secrecy of movement imposed</p>
<p>by the situation consuming many valuable hours.</p>
<p>While Ricketts was occupying the enemy&#x27;s attention, Crook, again</p>
<p>moving unobserved into the dense timber on the eastern face of Little</p>
<p>North Mountain, conducted his command south in two parallel columns</p>
<p>until he gained the rear of the enemy&#x27;s works, when, marching his</p>
<p>divisions by the left flank, he led them in an easterly direction</p>
<p>down the mountain-side.  As he emerged from the timber near the base</p>
<p>of the mountain, the Confederates discovered him, of course, and</p>
<p>opened with their batteries, but it was too late--they having few</p>
<p>troops at hand to confront the turning-column.  Loudly cheering,</p>
<p>Crook&#x27;s men quickly crossed the broken stretch in rear of the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>left, producing confusion and consternation at every step.</p>
<p>About a mile from the mountain&#x27;s base Crook&#x27;s left was joined by</p>
<p>Ricketts, who in proper time had begun to swing his division into the</p>
<p>action, and the two commands moved along in rear of the works so</p>
<p>rapidly that, with but slight resistance, the Confederates abandoned</p>
<p>the guns massed near the centre.  The swinging movement of Ricketts</p>
<p>was taken up successively from right to left throughout my line, and</p>
<p>in a few minutes the enemy was thoroughly routed, the action, though</p>
<p>brief, being none the less decisive.  Lomax&#x27;s dismounted cavalry gave</p>
<p>way first, but was shortly followed by all the Confederate infantry</p>
<p>in an indescribable panic, precipitated doubtless by fears of being</p>
<p>caught and captured in the pocket formed by Tumbling Run and the</p>
<p>North Fork of the Shenandoah River.  The stampede was complete, the</p>
<p>enemy leaving the field without semblance of organization, abandoning</p>
<p>nearly all his artillery and such other property as was in the works,</p>
<p>and the rout extending through the fields and over the roads toward</p>
<p>Woodstock, Wright and Emory in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>Midway between Fisher&#x27;s Hill and Woodstock there is some high ground,</p>
<p>where at night-fall a small squad endeavored to stay us with two</p>
<p>pieces of artillery, but this attempt at resistance proved fruitless,</p>
<p>and, notwithstanding the darkness, the guns were soon captured.  The</p>
<p>chase was then taken up by Devin&#x27;s brigade as soon as it could be</p>
<p>passed to the front, and continued till after daylight the next</p>
<p>morning, but the delays incident to a night pursuit made it</p>
<p>impossible for Devin to do more than pick up stragglers.</p>
<p>Our success was very great, yet I had anticipated results still more</p>
<p>pregnant.  Indeed, I had high hopes of capturing almost the whole of</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s army before it reached New Market, and with this object in</p>
<p>view, during the manoeuvres of the 21st I had sent Torbert up the</p>
<p>Luray Valley with Wilson&#x27;s division and two of Merritt&#x27;s brigades, in</p>
<p>the expectation that he would drive Wickham out of the Luray Pass by</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s right, and by crossing the Massanutten Mountain near New</p>
<p>Market, gain his rear.  Torbert started in good season, and after</p>
<p>some slight skirmishing at Gooney Run, got as far as Milford, but</p>
<p>failed to dislodge Wickham.  In fact, he made little or no attempt to</p>
<p>force Wickham from his position, and with only a feeble effort</p>
<p>withdrew.  I heard nothing at all from Torbert during the 22d, and</p>
<p>supposing that everything was progressing favorably, I was astonished</p>
<p>and chagrined on the morning of the 23d, at Woodstock, to receive the</p>
<p>intelligence that he had fallen back to Front Royal and Buckton ford.</p>
<p>My disappointment was extreme, but there was now no help for the</p>
<p>situation save to renew and emphasize Torbert&#x27;s orders, and this was</p>
<p>done at once, notwithstanding that I thought, the delay, had so much</p>
<p>diminished the chances of his getting in the rear of Early as to make</p>
<p>such a result a very remote possibility, unless, indeed, far greater</p>
<p>zeal was displayed than had been in the first attempt to penetrate</p>
<p>the Luray Valley.</p>
<p>The battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill was, in a measure, a part of the battle</p>
<p>of the Opequon; that is to say, it was an incident of the pursuit</p>
<p>resulting from that action.  In many ways, however, it was much more</p>
<p>satisfactory, and particularly so because the plan arranged on the</p>
<p>evening of the 20th was carried out to the very letter by Generals</p>
<p>Wright, Crook, and Emory, not only in all their preliminary</p>
<p>manoeuvres, but also during the fight itself.  The only drawback was</p>
<p>with the cavalry, and to this day I have been unable to account</p>
<p>satisfactorily for Torbert&#x27;s failure.  No doubt, Wickham&#x27;s position</p>
<p>near Milford was a strong one, but Torbert ought to have made a</p>
<p>fight.  Had he been defeated in this, his withdrawal then to await</p>
<p>the result at Fisher&#x27;s Hill would have been justified, but it does</p>
<p>not appear that he made any serious effort of all to dislodge the</p>
<p>Confederate cavalry: his impotent attempt not only chagrined me very</p>
<p>much, but occasioned much unfavorable comment throughout the army.</p>
<p>We reached Woodstock early on the morning of the 23d, and halted</p>
<p>there some little time to let the troops recover their organization,</p>
<p>which had been broken in the night march they had just made.  When</p>
<p>the commands had closed up we pushed on toward Edinburg, in the hope</p>
<p>of making more captures at Narrow Passage Creek; but the</p>
<p>Confederates, too fleet for us, got away; so General Wright halted</p>
<p>the infantry not far from Edinburg, till rations could be brought the</p>
<p>men.  Meanwhile I, having remained at Woodstock, sent Dedin&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>to press the enemy under every favorable opportunity, and if possible</p>
<p>prevent him from halting long enough to reorganize.  Notwithstanding</p>
<p>Devin&#x27;s efforts the Confederates managed to assemble a considerable</p>
<p>force to resist him, and being too weak for the rearguard, he awaited</p>
<p>the arrival of Averell, who, I had informed him, would be hurried to</p>
<p>the front with all possible despatch, for I thought that Averell must</p>
<p>be close at hand.  It turned out, however, that he was not near by at</p>
<p>all, and, moreover, that without good reason he had refrained from</p>
<p>taking any part whatever in pursuing the enemy in the flight from</p>
<p>Fisher&#x27;s Hill; and in fact had gone into camp and left to the</p>
<p>infantry the work of pursuit.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon when Averell came up, and a great deal of precious</p>
<p>time had been lost.  We had some hot words, but hoping that he would</p>
<p>retrieve the mistake of the night before, I directed him to proceed</p>
<p>to the front at once, and in conjunction with Devin close with the</p>
<p>enemy.  He reached Devin&#x27;s command about 3 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon,</p>
<p>just as this officer was pushing the Confederates so energetically</p>
<p>that they were abandoning Mount Jackson, yet Averell utterly failed</p>
<p>to accomplish anything.  Indeed, his indifferent attack was not at</p>
<p>all worthy the excellent soldiers he commanded, and when I learned</p>
<p>that it was his intention to withdraw from the enemy&#x27;s front, and</p>
<p>this, too, on the indefinite report of a signal-officer that a</p>
<p>&quot;brigade or division&quot; of Confederates was turning his right flank,</p>
<p>and that he had not seriously attempted to verify the information, I</p>
<p>sent him this order:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,</p>
<p>&quot;Woodstock, Va., Sept.  23, 1864</p>
<p>&quot;BREVET MAJOR-GENERAL AVERELL</p>
<p>&quot;Your report and report of signal-officer received.  I do not want</p>
<p>you to let the enemy bluff you or your command, and I want you to</p>
<p>distinctly understand this note.  I do not advise rashness, but I do</p>
<p>desire resolution and actual fighting, with necessary casualties,</p>
<p>before you retire.  There must now be no backing or filling by you</p>
<p>without a superior force of the enemy actually engaging you.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General Commanding.&#x27;</p>
<p>Some little time after this note went to Averell, word was brought me</p>
<p>that he had already carried out the programme indicated when</p>
<p>forwarding the report of the expected turning of his right, and that</p>
<p>he had actually withdrawn and gone into camp near Hawkinsburg.  I</p>
<p>then decided to relieve him from the command of his division, which I</p>
<p>did, ordering him to Wheeling, Colonel William H. Powell being</p>
<p>assigned to succeed him.</p>
<p>The removal of Averell was but the culmination of a series of events</p>
<p>extending back to the time I assumed command of the Middle Military</p>
<p>Division.  At the outset, General Grant, fearing discord on account</p>
<p>of Averell&#x27;s ranking Torbert, authorized me to relieve the former</p>
<p>officer, but I hoped that if any trouble of this sort arose, it could</p>
<p>be allayed, or at least repressed, during the campaign against Early,</p>
<p>since the different commands would often have to act separately.</p>
<p>After that, the dispersion of my army by the return of the Sixth</p>
<p>Corps and Torbert&#x27;s cavalry to the Army of the Potomac would take</p>
<p>place, I thought, and this would restore matters to their normal</p>
<p>condition ; but Averell&#x27;s dissatisfaction began to show itself</p>
<p>immediately after his arrival at Martinsburg, on the 14th of August,</p>
<p>and, except when he was conducting some independent expedition, had</p>
<p>been manifested on all occasions since.  I therefore thought that the</p>
<p>interest of the service would be subserved by removing one whose</p>
<p>growing indifference might render the best-laid plans inoperative.</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION.</p>
<p>&quot;HARRISONBURG, VA., SEPT.  25, 1864 11:30 P. M.</p>
<p>&quot;LIEUT-GENERAL GRANT, Comd&#x27;g, City Point, Va.</p>
<p>&quot;I have relieved Averell from his command.  Instead of following the</p>
<p>enemy when he was broken at Fisher&#x27;s Hill (so there was not a cavalry</p>
<p>organization left), he went into camp and let me pursue the enemy for</p>
<p>a distance of fifteen miles, with infantry, during the night.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.&quot;</p>
<p>The failure of Averell to press the enemy the evening of the 23d gave</p>
<p>Early time to collect his scattered forces and take up a position on</p>
<p>the east side of the North Fork of the Shenandoah, his left resting</p>
<p>on the west side of that stream at Rude&#x27;s Hill, a commanding point</p>
<p>about two miles south of Mt.  Jackson.  Along this line he had</p>
<p>constructed some slight works during the night, and at daylight on</p>
<p>the 24th, I moved the Sixth and Nineteenth corps through Mt. Jackson</p>
<p>to attack him, sending Powell&#x27;s division to pass around his left</p>
<p>flank, toward Timberville, and Devin&#x27;s brigade across the North Fork,</p>
<p>to move along the base of Peaked Ridge and attack his right.  The</p>
<p>country was entirely open, and none of these manoeuvres could be</p>
<p>executed without being observed, so as soon as my advance began, the</p>
<p>enemy rapidly retreated in line of battle up the valley through New</p>
<p>Market, closely followed by Wright and Emory, their artillery on the</p>
<p>pike and their columns on its right and left.  Both sides moved with</p>
<p>celerity, the Confederates stimulated by the desire to escape, and</p>
<p>our men animated by the prospect of wholly destroying Early&#x27;s army.</p>
<p>The stern-chase continued for about thirteen miles, our infantry</p>
<p>often coming within range, yet whenever we began to deploy, the</p>
<p>Confederates increased the distance between us by resorting to a</p>
<p>double quick, evading battle with admirable tact.  While all this was</p>
<p>going on, the open country permitted us a rare and brilliant sight,</p>
<p>the bright sun gleaming from the arms and trappings of the thousands</p>
<p>of pursuers and pursued.</p>
<p>Near New Market, as a last effort to hold the enemy, I pushed Devin&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry--comprising about five hundred men--with two guns right up on</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s lines, in the hope that the tempting opportunity given him to</p>
<p>capture the guns would stay his retreat long enough to let my</p>
<p>infantry deploy within range, but he refused the bait, and after</p>
<p>momentarily checking Devin he continued on with little loss and in</p>
<p>pretty good order.</p>
<p>All hope of Torbert&#x27;s appearing in rear of the Confederates vanished</p>
<p>as they passed beyond New Market.  Some six miles south of this place</p>
<p>Early left the Valley Pike and took the road to Keezletown, a move</p>
<p>due in a measure to Powell&#x27;s march by way of Timberville toward</p>
<p>Lacy&#x27;s Springs, but mainly caused by the fact that the Keezletown</p>
<p>road ran immediately along the base of Peaked Mountain--a rugged</p>
<p>ridge affording protection to Early&#x27;s right flank--and led in a</p>
<p>direction facilitating his junction with Kershaw, who had been</p>
<p>ordered back to him from Culpeper the day after the battle of the</p>
<p>Opequon.  The chase was kept up on the Keezeltown road till darkness</p>
<p>overtook us, when my weary troops were permitted to go into camp; and</p>
<p>as soon as the enemy discovered by our fires that the pursuit had</p>
<p>stopped, he also bivouacked some five miles farther south toward Port</p>
<p>Republic.</p>
<p>The next morning Early was joined by Lomax&#x27;s cavalry from</p>
<p>Harrisonburg, Wickham&#x27;s and Payne&#x27;s brigades of cavalry also uniting</p>
<p>with him from the Luray Valley.  His whole army then fell back to the</p>
<p>mouth of Brown&#x27;s Gap to await Kershaw&#x27;s division and Cutshaw&#x27;s</p>
<p>artillery, now on their return.</p>
<p>By the morning of the 25th the main body of the enemy had disappeared</p>
<p>entirely from my front, and the capture of some small, squads of</p>
<p>Confederates in the neighboring hills furnished us the only incidents</p>
<p>of the day.  Among the prisoners was a tall and fine looking officer,</p>
<p>much worn with hunger and fatigue.  The moment I saw him I recognized</p>
<p>him as a former comrade, George W. Carr, with whom I had served in</p>
<p>Washington Territory.  He was in those days a lieutenant in the Ninth</p>
<p>Infantry, and was one of the officers who superintended the execution</p>
<p>of the nine Indians at the Cascades of the Columbia in 1856.  Carr</p>
<p>was very much emaciated, and greatly discouraged by the turn events</p>
<p>had recently taken.  For old acquaintance sake I gave him plenty to</p>
<p>eat, and kept him in comfort at my headquarters until the next batch</p>
<p>of prisoners was sent to the rear, when he went with them.  He had</p>
<p>resigned from the regular army at the commencement of hostilities,</p>
<p>and, full of high anticipation, cast his lot with the Confederacy,</p>
<p>but when he fell into our hands, his bright dreams having been</p>
<p>dispelled by the harsh realities of war, he appeared to think that</p>
<p>for him there was no future.</p>
<p>Picking up prisoners here and there, my troops resumed their march</p>
<p>directly south on the Valley pike, and when the Sixth and Nineteenth</p>
<p>corps reached Harrisonburg, they went into camp, Powell in the</p>
<p>meanwhile pushing on to Mt. Crawford, and Crook taking up a position</p>
<p>in our rear at the junction of the Keezletown road and the Valley</p>
<p>pike.  Late in the afternoon Torbert&#x27;s cavalry came in from New</p>
<p>Market arriving at that place many hours later than it had been</p>
<p>expected.</p>
<p>The succeeding day I sent Merritt to Port Republic to occupy the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s attention, while Torbert, with Wilson&#x27;s division and the</p>
<p>regular brigade, was ordered to Staunton, whence he was to proceed to</p>
<p>Waynesboro&#x27; and blow up the railroad bridge.  Having done this,</p>
<p>Torbert, as he returned, was to drive off whatever cattle he could</p>
<p>find, destroy all forage and breadstuffs, and burn the mills.  He</p>
<p>took possession of Waynesboro&#x27; in due time, but had succeeded in only</p>
<p>partially demolishing the railroad bridge when, attacked by Pegram&#x27;s</p>
<p>division of infantry and Wickham&#x27;s cavalry, he was compelled to fall</p>
<p>back to Staunton.  From the latter place he retired to Bridgewater,</p>
<p>and Spring Hill, on the way, however, fully executing his</p>
<p>instructions regarding the destructLon of supplies.</p>
<p>While Torbert was on this expedition, Merritt had occupied Port</p>
<p>Republic, but he happened to get there the very day that Kershaw&#x27;s</p>
<p>division was marching from Swift Run Gap to join Early.  By accident</p>
<p>Kershaw ran into Merritt shortly after the latter had gained the</p>
<p>village.  Kershaw&#x27;s four infantry brigades attacked at once, and</p>
<p>Merrit, forced out of Port Republic, fell back toward Cross Keys; and</p>
<p>in anticipation that the Confederates could be coaxed to that point,</p>
<p>I ordered the infantry there, but Torbert&#x27;s attack at Wavnesboro&#x27; had</p>
<p>alarmed Early, and in consequence he drew all his forces in toward</p>
<p>Rock-fish Gap.  This enabled me to re-establish Merritt at Port</p>
<p>Republic, send the Sixth and Nineteenth corps to the neighborhood of</p>
<p>Mt. Crawford to await the return of Torbert, and to post Crook at</p>
<p>Harrisonburg; these dispositions practically obtained till the 6th of</p>
<p>October, I holding a line across the valley from Port Republic along</p>
<p>North River by Mt. Crawford to the Back road near the mouth of Briery</p>
<p>Branch Gap.</p>
<p>It was during this period, about dusk on the evening of October 3,</p>
<p>that between Harrisonburg and Dayton my engineer officer, Lieutenant</p>
<p>John R. Meigs, was murdered within my lines.  He had gone out with</p>
<p>two topographical assistants to plot the country, and late in the</p>
<p>evening, while riding along the public road on his return to camp, he</p>
<p>overtook three men dressed in our uniform.  From their dress, and</p>
<p>also because the party was immediately behind our lines and within a</p>
<p>mile and a half of my headquarters, Meigs and his assistants</p>
<p>naturally thought that they were joining friends, and wholly</p>
<p>unsuspicious of anything to the contrary, rode on with the three men</p>
<p>some little distance; but their perfidy was abruptly discovered by</p>
<p>their suddenly turning upon Meigs with a call for his surrender.  It</p>
<p>has been claimed that, refusing to submit, he fired on the</p>
<p>treacherous party, but the statement is not true, for one of the</p>
<p>topographers escaped--the other was captured--and reported a few</p>
<p>minutes later at my headquarters that Meigs was killed without</p>
<p>resistance of any kind whatever, and without even the chance to give</p>
<p>himself up.  This man was so cool, and related all the circumstances</p>
<p>of the occurrence with such exactness, as to prove the truthfulness</p>
<p>of his statement.  The fact that the murder had been committed inside</p>
<p>our lines was evidence that the perpetrators of the crime, having</p>
<p>their homes in the vicinity, had been clandestinely visiting them,</p>
<p>and been secretly harbored by some of the neighboring residents.</p>
<p>Determining to teach a lesson to these abettors of the foul deed--a</p>
<p>lesson they would never forget--I ordered all the houses within an</p>
<p>area of five miles to be burned.  General Custer, who had succeeded</p>
<p>to the command of the Third Cavalry division (General Wilson having</p>
<p>been detailed as chief of cavalry to Sherman&#x27;s army), was charged</p>
<p>with this duty, and the next morning proceeded to put the order into</p>
<p>execution.  The prescribed area included the little village of</p>
<p>Dayton, but when a few houses in the immediate neighborhood of the</p>
<p>scene of the murder had been burned, Custer was directed to cease his</p>
<p>desolating work, but to fetch away all the able-bodied males as</p>
<p>prisoners.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<p>REASONS FOR NOT PURSUING EARLY THROUGH THE BLUE RIDGE--GENERAL</p>
<p>TORBERT DETAILED TO GIVE GENERAL ROSSER A &quot;DRUBBING&quot;--GENERAL ROSSER</p>
<p>ROUTED--TELEGRAPHED TO MEET STANTON--LONGSTREET&#x27;S MESSAGE--RETURN TO</p>
<p>WINCHESTER--THE RIDE TO CEDAR CREEK--THE RETREATING ARMY--RALLYING</p>
<p>THE TROOPS--REFORMING THE LINE--COMMENCING THE ATTACK--DEFEAT OF THE</p>
<p>CONFEDERATES--APPOINTED A MAJOR-GENERAL IN THE REGULAR ARMY--RESULTS</p>
<p>OF THE BATTLE.</p>
<p>While we lay in camp at Harrisonburg it became necessary to decide</p>
<p>whether or not I would advance to Brown&#x27;s Gap, and, after driving the</p>
<p>enemy from there, follow him through the Blue Ridge into eastern</p>
<p>Virginia.  Indeed, this question began to cause me solicitude as soon</p>
<p>as I knew Early had escaped me at New Market, for I felt certain that</p>
<p>I should be urged to pursue the Confederates toward Charlottesville</p>
<p>and Gordonsville, and be expected to operate on that line against</p>
<p>Richmond.  For many reasons I was much opposed to such a plan, but</p>
<p>mainly because its execution would involve the opening of the Orange</p>
<p>and Alexandria railroad.  To protect this road against the raids of</p>
<p>the numerous guerrilla bands that infested the region through which</p>
<p>it passed, and to keep it in operation, would require a large force</p>
<p>of infantry, and would also greatly reduce my cavalry; besides, I</p>
<p>should be obliged to leave a force in the valley strong enough to</p>
<p>give security to the line of the upper Potomac and the Baltimore and</p>
<p>Ohio railroad, and this alone would probably take the whole of</p>
<p>Crook&#x27;s command, leaving me a wholly inadequate number of fighting</p>
<p>men to prosecute a campaign against the city of Richmond.  Then, too,</p>
<p>I was in doubt whether the besiegers could hold the entire army at</p>
<p>Petersburg; and in case they could not, a number of troops sufficient</p>
<p>to crush me might be detached by Lee, moved rapidly by rail, and,</p>
<p>after overwhelming me, be quickly returned to confront General Meade.</p>
<p>I was satisfied, moreover, that my transportation could not supply me</p>
<p>further than Harrisonburg, and if in penetrating the Blue Ridge I met</p>
<p>with protracted resistance, a lack of supplies might compel me to</p>
<p>abandon the attempt at a most inopportune time.</p>
<p>I therefore advised that the Valley campaign be terminated north of</p>
<p>Staunton, and I be permitted to return, carrying out on the way my</p>
<p>original instructions for desolating the Shenandoah country so as to</p>
<p>make it untenable for permanent occupation by the Confederates.  I</p>
<p>proposed to detach the bulk of my army when this work of destruction</p>
<p>was completed, and send it by way of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad</p>
<p>through Washington to the Petersburg line, believing that I could</p>
<p>move it more rapidly by that route than by any other.  I was</p>
<p>confident that if a movement of this character could be made with</p>
<p>celerity it would culminate in the capture of Richmond and possibly</p>
<p>of General Lee&#x27;s army, and I was in hopes that General Grant would</p>
<p>take the same view of the matter; but just at this time he was so</p>
<p>pressed by the Government and by public-opinion at the North, that he</p>
<p>advocated the wholly different conception of driving Early into</p>
<p>eastern Virginia, and adhered to this plan with some tenacity.</p>
<p>Considerable correspondence regarding the subject took place between</p>
<p>us, throughout which I stoutly maintained that we should not risk, by</p>
<p>what I held to be a false move, all that my army had gained.  I being</p>
<p>on the ground, General Grant left to me the final decision of the</p>
<p>question, and I solved the first step by determining to withdraw down</p>
<p>the valley at least as far as Strasburg, which movement was begun on</p>
<p>the 6th of October.</p>
<p>The cavalry as it retired was stretched across the country from the</p>
<p>Blue Ridge to the eastern slope of the Alleghanies, with orders to</p>
<p>drive off all stock and destroy all supplies as it moved northward.</p>
<p>The infantry preceded the cavalry, passing down the Valley pike, and</p>
<p>as we marched along the many columns of smoke from burning stacks,</p>
<p>and mills filled with grain, indicated that the adjacent country was</p>
<p>fast losing the features which hitherto had made it a great magazine</p>
<p>of stores for the Confederate armies.</p>
<p>During the 6th and 7th of October, the enemy&#x27;s horse followed us up,</p>
<p>though at a respectful distance.  This cavalry was now under command</p>
<p>of General T. W. Rosser, who on October 5 had joined Early with an</p>
<p>additional brigade from Richmond.  As we proceeded the Confederates</p>
<p>gained confidence, probably on account of the reputation with which</p>
<p>its new commander had been heralded, and on the third day&#x27;s march had</p>
<p>the temerity to annoy my rear guard considerably.  Tired of these</p>
<p>annoyances, I concluded to open the enemy&#x27;s eyes in earnest, so that</p>
<p>night I told Torbert I expected him either to give Rosser a drubbing</p>
<p>next morning or get whipped himself, and that the infantry would be</p>
<p>halted until the affair was over; I also informed him that I proposed</p>
<p>to ride out to Round Top Mountain to see the fight.  When I decided</p>
<p>to have Rosser chastised, Merritt was encamped at the foot of Round</p>
<p>Top, an elevation just north of Tom&#x27;s Brook, and Custer some six</p>
<p>miles farther north and west, near Tumbling Run.  In the night Custer</p>
<p>was ordered to retrace his steps before daylight by the Back road,</p>
<p>which is parallel to and about three miles from the Valley pike, and</p>
<p>attack the enemy at Tom&#x27;s Brook crossing, while Merritt&#x27;s</p>
<p>instructions were to assail him on the Valley pike in concert with</p>
<p>Custer.  About 7 in the morning, Custer&#x27;s division encountered Rosser</p>
<p>himself with three brigades, and while the stirring sounds of the</p>
<p>resulting artillery duel were reverberating through the valley</p>
<p>Merritt moved briskly to the front and fell upon Generals Lomax and</p>
<p>Johnson on the Valley pike.  Merritt, by extending his right, quickly</p>
<p>established connection with Custer, and the two divisions moved</p>
<p>forward together under Torbert&#x27;s direction, with a determination to</p>
<p>inflict on the enemy the sharp and summary punishment his rashness</p>
<p>had invited.</p>
<p>The engagement soon became general across the valley, both sides</p>
<p>fighting mainly mounted.  For about two hours the contending lines</p>
<p>struggled with each other along Tom&#x27;s Brook, the charges and counter</p>
<p>charges at many points being plainly visible from the summit of Round</p>
<p>Top, where I had my headquarters for the time.</p>
<p>The open country permitting a sabre fight, both sides seemed bent on</p>
<p>using that arm.  In the centre the Confederates maintained their</p>
<p>position with much stubbornness, and for a time seemed to have</p>
<p>recovered their former spirit, but at last they began to give way on</p>
<p>both flanks, and as these receded, Merritt and Custer went at the</p>
<p>wavering ranks in a charge along the whole front.  The result was a</p>
<p>general smash-up of the entire Confederate line, the retreat quickly</p>
<p>degenerating into a rout the like of which was never before seen.</p>
<p>For twenty-six miles this wild stampede kept up, with our troopers</p>
<p>close at the enemy&#x27;s heels; and the ludicrous incidents of the chase</p>
<p>never ceased to be amusing topics around the camp-fires of Merritt</p>
<p>and Custer.  In the fight and pursuit Torbert took eleven pieces of</p>
<p>artillery, with their caissons, all the wagons and ambulances the</p>
<p>enemy had on the ground, and three hundred prisoners.  Some of</p>
<p>Rosser&#x27;s troopers fled to the mountains by way of Columbia Furnace,</p>
<p>and some up the Valley pike and into the Massamitten Range,</p>
<p>apparently not discovering that the chase had been discontinued till</p>
<p>south of Mount Jackson they rallied on Early&#x27;s infantry.</p>
<p>After this catastrophe, Early reported to General Lee that his</p>
<p>cavalry was so badly demoralized that it should be dismounted; and</p>
<p>the citizens of the valley, intensely disgusted with the boasting and</p>
<p>swaggering that had characterized the arrival of the &quot;Laurel Brigade&quot;</p>
<p>in that section, baptized the action (known to us as Tom&#x27;s Brook) the</p>
<p>&quot;Woodstock Races,&quot; and never tired of poking fun at General Rosser</p>
<p>about his precipitate and inglorious flight.  (When Rosser arrived</p>
<p>from Richmond with his brigade he was proclaimed as the savior of the</p>
<p>Valley, and his men came all bedecked with laurel branches.)</p>
<p>On the l0th my army, resuming its retrograde movement, crossed to the</p>
<p>north side of Cedar Creek.  The work of repairing the Manassas Gap</p>
<p>branch of the Orange and Alexandria railroad had been begun some days</p>
<p>before, out from Washington, and, anticipating that it would be in</p>
<p>readiness to transport troops by the time they could reach Piedmont,</p>
<p>I directed the Sixth Corps to continue its march toward Front Royal,</p>
<p>expecting to return to the Army of the Potomac by that line.  By the</p>
<p>12th, however, my views regarding the reconstruction of this railroad</p>
<p>began to prevail, and the work on it was discontinued.  The Sixth</p>
<p>Corps, therefore, abandoned that route, and moved toward Ashby&#x27;s Gap</p>
<p>with the purpose of marching direct to Washington, but on the l3th I</p>
<p>recalled it to Cedar Creek, in consequence of the arrival of the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s infantry at Fisher&#x27;s Hill, and the receipt, the night before,</p>
<p>of the following despatch, which again opened the question of an</p>
<p>advance on Gordonsville and Charlottesville:</p>
<p>(Cipher.)</p>
<p>&quot;WASHINGTON, October 12, 1864, 12 M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN:</p>
<p>&quot;Lieutenant-General Grant wishes a position taken far enough south to</p>
<p>serve as a base for further operations upon Gordonsville and</p>
<p>Charlottesville.  It must be strongly fortified and provisioned.</p>
<p>Some point in the vicinity of Manassas Gap would seem best suited for</p>
<p>all purposes.  Colonel Alexander, of the Engineers, will be sent to</p>
<p>consult with you as soon as you connect with General Augur.</p>
<p>&quot;H.  W.  HALLECK, Major-General.&quot;</p>
<p>As it was well known in Washington that the views expressed in the</p>
<p>above despatch were counter to my convictions, I was the next day</p>
<p>required by the following telegram from Secretary Stanton to repair</p>
<p>to that city :</p>
<p>&quot; WASHINGTON, October 13, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN</p>
<p>(through General Augur)</p>
<p>&quot;If you can come here, a consultation on several points is extremely</p>
<p>desirable.  I propose to visit General Grant, and would like to see</p>
<p>you first.</p>
<p>&quot;EDWIN M.  STANTON,</p>
<p>&quot;Secretary of War.&quot;</p>
<p>I got all ready to comply with the terms of Secretary Stanton&#x27;s</p>
<p>despatch, but in the meantime the enemy appeared in my front in</p>
<p>force, with infantry and cavalry, and attacked Colonel Thoburn, who</p>
<p>had been pushed out toward Strasburg from Crook&#x27;s command, and also</p>
<p>Custer&#x27;s division of cavalry on the Back road.  As afterward</p>
<p>appeared, this attack was made in the belief that all of my troops</p>
<p>but Crook&#x27;s had gone to Petersburg.  From this demonstration there</p>
<p>ensued near Hupp&#x27;s Hill a bitter skirmish between Kershaw and</p>
<p>Thoburn, and the latter was finally compelled to withdraw to the</p>
<p>north bank of Cedar Creek.  Custer gained better results, however, on</p>
<p>the Back road, with his usual dash driving the enemy&#x27;s cavalry away</p>
<p>from his front, Merritt&#x27;s division then joining him and remaining on</p>
<p>the right.</p>
<p>The day&#x27;s events pointing to a probability that the enemy intended to</p>
<p>resume the offensive, to anticipate such a contingency I ordered the</p>
<p>Sixth Corps to return from its march toward Ashby&#x27;s Gap.  It reached</p>
<p>me by noon of the 14th, and went into position to the right and rear</p>
<p>of the Nineteenth Corps, which held a line along the north bank of</p>
<p>Cedar Creek, west of the Valley pike.  Crook was posted on the left</p>
<p>of the Nineteenth Corps and east of the Valley pike, with Thoburn&#x27;s</p>
<p>division advanced to a round hill, which commanded the junction of</p>
<p>Cedar Creek and the Shenandoah River, while Torbert retained both</p>
<p>Merritt and Custer on the right of the Sixth Corps, and at the same</p>
<p>time covered with Powell the roads toward Front Royal.  My head-</p>
<p>quarters were at the Belle Grove House, which was to the west of the</p>
<p>pike and in rear of the Nineteenth Corps.  It was my intention to</p>
<p>attack the enemy as soon as the Sixth Corps reached me, but General</p>
<p>Early having learned from his demonstration that I had not detached</p>
<p>as largely as his previous information had led him to believe, on the</p>
<p>night of the 13th withdrew to Fisher&#x27;s Hill; so, concluding that he</p>
<p>could not do us serious hurt from there, I changed my mind as to</p>
<p>attacking, deciding to defer such action till I could get to</p>
<p>Washington, and come to some definite understanding about my future</p>
<p>operations.</p>
<p>To carry out this idea, on the evening of the 15th I ordered all of</p>
<p>the cavalry under General Torbert to accompany me to Front Royal,</p>
<p>again intending to push it thence through Chester Gap to the Virginia</p>
<p>Central railroad at Charlottesville, to destroy the bridge over the</p>
<p>Rivanna River, while I passed through Manassas Gap to Rectortown, and</p>
<p>thence by rail to Washington.  On my arrival with the cavalry near</p>
<p>Front Royal on the 16th, I halted at the house of Mrs. Richards, on</p>
<p>the north bank of the river, and there received the following</p>
<p>despatch and inclosure from General Wright, who had been left in</p>
<p>command at Cedar Creek :</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY Division,</p>
<p>&quot;October 16, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL:</p>
<p>&quot;I enclose you despatch which explains itself.  If the enemy should</p>
<p>be strongly reenforced in cavalry, he might, by turning our right,</p>
<p>give us a great deal of trouble.  I shall hold on here until the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s movements are developed, and shall only fear an attack on my</p>
<p>right, which I shall make every preparation for guarding against and</p>
<p>resisting.</p>
<p>&quot;Very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>&quot;H.  G.  WRIGHT, Major-General Commanding.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Middle Military Division.&quot;</p>
<p>[INCLOSURE.] &quot;To LIEUTENANT-GENERAL EARLY:</p>
<p>&quot;Be ready to move as soon as my forces join you, and we will crush</p>
<p>Sheridan.</p>
<p>&quot;LONGSTREET, Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>The message from Longstreet had been taken down as it was being</p>
<p>flagged from the Confederate signal-station on Three Top Mountain,</p>
<p>and afterward translated by our signal officers, who knew the</p>
<p>Confederate signal code.  I first thought it a ruse, and hardly worth</p>
<p>attention, but on reflection deemed it best to be on the safe side,</p>
<p>so I abandoned the cavalry raid toward Charlottesville, in order to</p>
<p>give General Wright the, entire strength of the army, for it did not</p>
<p>seem wise to reduce his numbers while reinforcement for the enemy</p>
<p>might be near, and especially when such pregnant messages were</p>
<p>reaching Early from one of the ablest of the Confederate generals.</p>
<p>Therefore I sent the following note to General Wright:      I</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,</p>
<p>&quot;Front Royal, October 16, x864.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL: The cavalry is all ordered back to you; make your position</p>
<p>strong.  If Longstreet&#x27;s despatch is true, he is under the impression</p>
<p>that we have largely detached.  I will go over to Augur, and may get</p>
<p>additional news.  Close in Colonel Powell, who will be at this point.</p>
<p>If the enemy should make an advance, I know you will defeat him.</p>
<p>Look well to your ground and be well prepared.  Get up everything</p>
<p>that can be spared.  I will bring up all I can, and will be up on</p>
<p>Tuesday, if not sooner.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL H.  G.  WRIGHT,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Sixth Army Corps.&quot;</p>
<p>At 5 o&#x27;clock on the evening of the 16th I telegraphed General Halleck</p>
<p>from Rectortown, giving him the information which had come to me from</p>
<p>Wright, asking if anything corroborative of it had been received from</p>
<p>General Grant, and also saying that I would like to see Halleck; the</p>
<p>telegram ending with the question: &quot;Is it best for me to go to see</p>
<p>you?&quot;  Next morning I sent back to Wright all the cavalry except one</p>
<p>regiment, which escorted me through Manassas Gap to the terminus of</p>
<p>the railroad from Washington.  I had with me Lieutenant-Colonel James</p>
<p>W.  Forsyth, chief-of-staff, and three of my aides, Major George A.</p>
<p>Forsyth, Captain Joseph O&#x27;Keefe, and Captain Michael V. Sheridan.  I</p>
<p>rode my black horse, Rienzi, and the others their own respective</p>
<p>mounts.</p>
<p>Before leaving Cedar Creek I had fixed the route of my return to be</p>
<p>by rail from Washington to Martinsburg, and thence by horseback to</p>
<p>Winchester and Cedar Creek, and had ordered three hundred cavalry to</p>
<p>Martinsburg to escort me from that point to the front.  At Rectortown</p>
<p>I met General Augur, who had brought a force out from Washington to</p>
<p>reconstruct and protect the line of railroad, and through him</p>
<p>received the following reply from General Halleck:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>&quot;WASHINGTON, D.C., October 16 1864</p>
<p>&quot;To MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Rectortown, Va.</p>
<p>General Grant says that Longstreet brought with him no troops from</p>
<p>Richmond, but I have very little confidence in the information</p>
<p>collected at his headquarters.  If you can leave your command with</p>
<p>safety, come to Washington, as I wish to give you the views of the</p>
<p>authorities here.</p>
<p>&quot;H. W. HALLECK, Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.</p>
<p>In consequence of the Longstreet despatch, I felt a concern about my</p>
<p>absence which I could hardly repress, but after duly considering what</p>
<p>Halleck said, and believing that Longstreet could not unite with</p>
<p>Early before I got back, and that even if he did Wright would be able</p>
<p>to cope with them both, I and my staff, with our horses, took the</p>
<p>cars for Washington, where we arrived on the morning of the 17th at</p>
<p>about 8 o&#x27;clock.  I proceeded at an early hour to the War Department,</p>
<p>and as soon as I met Secretary Stanton, asked him for a special train</p>
<p>to be ready at 12 o&#x27;clock to take me to Martinsburg, saying that in</p>
<p>view of existing conditions I must get back to my army as quickly as</p>
<p>possible.  He at once gave the order for the train, and then the</p>
<p>Secretary, Halleck, and I proceeded to hold a consultation in regard</p>
<p>to my operating east of the Blue Ridge.  The upshot was that my views</p>
<p>against such a plan were practically agreed to, and two engineer</p>
<p>officers were designated to return with me for the purpose of</p>
<p>reporting on a defensive line in the valley that could be held while</p>
<p>the bulk of my troops were being detached to Petersburg.  Colonel</p>
<p>Alexander and Colonel Thom both of the Engineer Corps, reported to</p>
<p>accompany me, and at 12 o&#x27;clock we took the train.</p>
<p>We arrived about dark at Martinsburg, and there found the escort of</p>
<p>three hundred men which I had ordered before leaving Cedar Creek.  We</p>
<p>spent that night at Martinsburg, and early next morning mounted and</p>
<p>started up the Valley pike for Winchester, leaving Captain Sheridan</p>
<p>behind to conduct to the army the Commissioners whom the State of New</p>
<p>York had sent down to receive the vote of her troops in the coming</p>
<p>Presidential election.  Colonel Alexander was a man of enormous</p>
<p>weight, and Colonel Thom correspondingly light, and as both were</p>
<p>unaccustomed to riding we had to go slowly, losing so much time, in</p>
<p>fact, that we did not reach Winchester till between 3 and 4 o&#x27;clock</p>
<p>in the afternoon, though the distance is but twenty-eight miles.  As</p>
<p>soon as we arrived at Colonel Edwards&#x27;s headquarters in the town,</p>
<p>where I intended stopping for the night, I sent a courier to the</p>
<p>front to bring me a report of the condition of affairs, and then took</p>
<p>Colonel Alexander out on the heights about Winchester, in order that</p>
<p>he might overlook the country, and make up his mind as to the utility</p>
<p>of fortifying there.  By the time we had completed our survey it was</p>
<p>dark, and just as we reached Colonel Edwards&#x27;s house on our return a</p>
<p>courier came in from Cedar Creek bringing word that everything was</p>
<p>all right, that the enemy was quiet at Fisher&#x27;s Hill, and that a</p>
<p>brigade of Grover&#x27;s division was to make a reconnoissance in the</p>
<p>morning, the 19th, so about 10 o&#x27;clock I went to bed greatly</p>
<p>relieved, and expecting to rejoin my headquarters at my leisure next</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>Toward 6 o&#x27;clock the morning of the 19th, the officer on picket duty</p>
<p>at Winchester came to my room, I being yet in bed, and reported</p>
<p>artillery firing from the direction of Cedar Creek.  I asked him if</p>
<p>the firing was continuous or only desultory, to which he replied that</p>
<p>it was not a sustained fire, but rather irregular and fitful.  I</p>
<p>remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s all right; Grover has gone out this morning to make a</p>
<p>reconnoissance, and he is merely feeling the enemy.&quot; I tried to go to</p>
<p>sleep again, but grew so restless that I could not, and soon got up</p>
<p>and dressed myself.  A little later the picket officer came back and</p>
<p>reported that the firing, which could be distinctly heard from his</p>
<p>line on the heights outside of Winchester, was still going on.  I</p>
<p>asked him if it sounded like a battle, and as he again said that it</p>
<p>did not, I still inferred that the cannonading was caused by Grover&#x27;s</p>
<p>division banging away at the enemy simply to find out what he was up</p>
<p>to.  However, I went down-stairs and requested that breakfast be</p>
<p>hurried up, and at the same time ordered the horses to be saddled and</p>
<p>in readiness, for I concluded to go to the front before any further</p>
<p>examinations were made in regard to the defensive line.</p>
<p>We mounted our horses between half-past 8 and 9, and as we were</p>
<p>proceeding up the street which leads directly through Winchester,</p>
<p>from the Logan residence, where Edwards was quartered, to the Valley</p>
<p>pike, I noticed that there were many women at the windows and doors</p>
<p>of the houses, who kept shaking their skirts at us and who were</p>
<p>otherwise markedly insolent in their demeanor, but supposing this</p>
<p>conduct to be instigated by their well-known and perhaps natural</p>
<p>prejudices, I ascribed to it no unusual significance.  On reaching</p>
<p>the edge of the town I halted a moment, and there heard quite</p>
<p>distinctly the sound of artillery firing in an unceasing roar.</p>
<p>Concluding from this that a battle was in progress, I now felt</p>
<p>confident that the women along the street had received intelligence</p>
<p>from the battle, field by the &quot;grape-vine telegraph,&quot; and were in</p>
<p>raptures over some good news, while I as yet was utterly ignorant of</p>
<p>the actual situation.  Moving on, I put my head down toward the</p>
<p>pommel of my saddle and listened intently, trying to locate and</p>
<p>interpret the sound, continuing in this position till we had crossed</p>
<p>Mill Creek, about half a mile from Winchester.  The result of my</p>
<p>efforts in the interval was the conviction that the travel of the</p>
<p>sound was increasing too rapidly to be accounted for by my own rate</p>
<p>of motion, and that therefore my army must be falling back.</p>
<p>At Mill Creek my escort fell in behind, and we were going ahead at a</p>
<p>regular pace, when, just as we made the crest of the rise beyond the</p>
<p>stream, there burst upon our view the appalling spectacle of a panic-</p>
<p>stricken army-hundreds of slightly wounded men, throngs of others</p>
<p>unhurt but utterly demoralized, and baggage-wagons by the score, all</p>
<p>pressing to the rear in hopeless confusion, telling only too plainly</p>
<p>that a disaster had occurred at the front.  On accosting some of the</p>
<p>fugitives, they assured me that the army was broken up, in full</p>
<p>retreat, and that all was lost; all this with a manner true to that</p>
<p>peculiar indifference that takes possession of panic-stricken men.  I</p>
<p>was greatly disturbed by the, sight, but at once sent word to Colonel</p>
<p>Edwards commanding the brigade in Winchester, to stretch his troops</p>
<p>across the valley, near Mill Creek, and stop all fugitives, directing</p>
<p>also that the transportation be, passed through and parked on the</p>
<p>north side of the town.</p>
<p>As I continued at a walk a few hundred yards farther, thinking all</p>
<p>the time of Longstreet&#x27;s telegram to Early, &quot;Be ready when I join</p>
<p>you, and we will crush Sheridan,&quot; I was fixing in my mind what I</p>
<p>should do.  My first thought was too stop the army in the suburbs of</p>
<p>Winchester as it came back, form a new line, and fight there; but as</p>
<p>the situation was more maturely considered a better conception</p>
<p>prevailed.  I was sure the troops had confidence in me, for</p>
<p>heretofore we had been successful; and as at other times they had</p>
<p>seen me present at the slightest sign of trouble or distress, I felt</p>
<p>that I ought to try now to restore their broken ranks, or, failing in</p>
<p>that, to share their fate because of what they had done hitherto.</p>
<p>About this time Colonel Wood, my chief commissary, arrived from the</p>
<p>front and gave me fuller intelligence, reporting that everything was</p>
<p>gone, my headquarters captured, and the troops dispersed.  When I</p>
<p>heard this I took two of my aides-de-camp, Major. George A. Forsyth</p>
<p>and Captain Joseph O&#x27;Keefe, and with twenty men from the escort</p>
<p>started for the front, at the same time directing Colonel James W.</p>
<p>Forsyth and Colonels Alexander and Thom to remain behind and do what</p>
<p>they could to stop the runaways.</p>
<p>For a short distance I traveled on the road, but soon found it so</p>
<p>blocked with wagons and wounded men that my progress was impeded, and</p>
<p>I was forced to take to the adjoining fields to make haste.  When</p>
<p>most of the wagons and wounded were past I returned to the road,</p>
<p>which was thickly lined with unhurt  men, who, having got far enough</p>
<p>to the rear to be out of danger, had halted, without any</p>
<p>organization, and begun cooking coffee, but when they saw me they</p>
<p>abandoned their coffee, threw up their hats, shouldered their</p>
<p>muskets, and as I passed along turned to follow with enthusiasm and</p>
<p>cheers.  To acknowledge this exhibition of feeling I took off my hat,</p>
<p>and with Forsyth and O&#x27;Keefe rode some distance in advance of my</p>
<p>escort, while every mounted officer who saw me galloped out on either</p>
<p>side of the pike to tell the men at a distance that I had come back.</p>
<p>In this way the news was spread to the stragglers off the road, when</p>
<p>they, too, turned their faces to the front and marched toward the</p>
<p>enemy, changing in a moment from the depths of depression , to the</p>
<p>extreme of enthusiasm.  I already knew that even in the ordinary</p>
<p>condition of mind enthusiasm is a potent element with soldiers, but</p>
<p>what I saw that day convinced me that if it can be excited from a</p>
<p>state of despondency its power is almost irresistible.  I said</p>
<p>nothing except to remark as I rode among those on the road: &quot;If I had</p>
<p>been, with you this morning this disaster would not have happened.</p>
<p>We must face the other way; we will go back and recover our camp.&quot;</p>
<p>My first halt was made just north of Newtown, where I met a chaplain</p>
<p>digging his heels into the sides of his jaded horse, and making for</p>
<p>the rear with all possible speed.  I drew up for an instant, and</p>
<p>inquired of him how matters were going at the front.  He replied,</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is lost; but all will be right when you get there&quot;; yet</p>
<p>notwithstanding this expression of confidence in me, the parson at</p>
<p>once resumed his breathless pace to the rear.  At Newtown I was</p>
<p>obliged to make a circuit to the left, to get round the village.  I</p>
<p>could not pass through it, the streets were so crowded, but meeting</p>
<p>on this detour Major McKinley, of Crook&#x27;s staff, he spread the news</p>
<p>of my return through the motley throng there.</p>
<p>When nearing the Valley pike, just south of Newtown I saw about</p>
<p>three-fourths of a mile west of the pike a body of troops, which</p>
<p>proved to be Ricketts&#x27;s and Wheaton&#x27;s divisions of the Sixth Corps,</p>
<p>and then learned that the Nineteenth Corps had halted a little to the</p>
<p>right and rear of these; but I did not stop, desiring to get to the</p>
<p>extreme front.  Continuing on parallel with the pike, about midway</p>
<p>between Newtown and Middletown I crossed to the west of it, and a</p>
<p>little later came up in rear of Getty&#x27;s division of the Sixth Corps.</p>
<p>When I arrived, this division and the cavalry were the only troops in</p>
<p>the presence of and resisting the enemy; they were apparently acting</p>
<p>as a rear-guard at a point about three miles north of the line we</p>
<p>held at Cedar Creek when the battle began.  General Torbert was the</p>
<p>first officer to meet me, saying as he rode up, &quot;My God! I am glad</p>
<p>you&#x27;ve come.&quot; Getty&#x27;s division, when I found it, was about a mile</p>
<p>north of Middletown, posted on the reverse slope of some slightly</p>
<p>rising ground, holding a barricade made with fence-rails, and</p>
<p>skirmishing slightly with the enemy&#x27;s pickets.  Jumping my horse over</p>
<p>the line of rails, I rode to the crest of the elevation, and there</p>
<p>taking off my hat, the men rose up from behind their barricade with</p>
<p>cheers of recognition.  An officer of the Vermont brigade, Colonel A.</p>
<p>S. Tracy, rode out to the front, and joining me, informed me that</p>
<p>General Louis A. Grant was in command there, the regular division</p>
<p>commander, General Getty, having taken charge of the Sixth Corps in</p>
<p>place of  Ricketts, wounded early in the action, while temporarily</p>
<p>commanding the corps.  I then turned back to the rear of Getty&#x27;s</p>
<p>division, and as I came behind it, a line of regimental flags rose up</p>
<p>out of the ground, as it seemed, to welcome me.  They were mostly the</p>
<p>colors of Crook&#x27;s troops, who had been stampeded and scattered in the</p>
<p>surprise of the morning.  The color-bearers, having withstood the</p>
<p>panic, had formed behind the troops of Getty.  The line with the</p>
<p>colors was largely composed of officers, among whom I recognized</p>
<p>Colonel R. B. Hayes, since president of the United States, one of the</p>
<p>brigade commanders.  At the close of this incident I crossed the</p>
<p>little narrow valley, or depression, in rear of Getty&#x27;s line, and</p>
<p>dismounting on the opposite crest, established that point as my</p>
<p>headquarters.  In a few minutes some of my staff joined me, and the</p>
<p>first directions I gave were to have the Nineteenth Corps and the two</p>
<p>divisions of Wright&#x27;s corps brought to the front, so they could be</p>
<p>formed on Getty&#x27;s division, prolonged to the right; for I had already</p>
<p>decided to attack the enemy from that line as soon as I could get</p>
<p>matters in shape to take the offensive.  Crook met me at this time,</p>
<p>and strongly favored my idea of attacking, but said, however, that</p>
<p>most of his troops were gone.  General Wright came up a little later,</p>
<p>when I saw that he was wounded, a ball having grazed the point of his</p>
<p>chin so as to draw the blood plentifully.</p>
<p>Wright gave me a hurried account of the day&#x27;s events, and when told</p>
<p>that we would fight the enemy on the line which Getty and the cavalry</p>
<p>were holding, and that he must go himself and send all his staff to</p>
<p>bring up the troops, he zealously fell in with the scheme; and it was</p>
<p>then that the Nineteenth Corps and two divisions of the Sixth were</p>
<p>ordered to the front from where they had been halted to the right and</p>
<p>rear of Getty.</p>
<p>After this conversation I rode to the east of the Valley pike and to</p>
<p>the left of Getty&#x27;s division, to a point from which I could obtain a</p>
<p>good view of the front, in the mean time sending Major Forsyth to</p>
<p>communicate with Colonel Lowell (who occupied a position close in</p>
<p>toward the suburbs of Middletown and directly in front of Getty&#x27;s</p>
<p>left) to learn whether he could hold on there.  Lowell replied that</p>
<p>he could.  I then ordered Custer&#x27;s division back to the right flank,</p>
<p>and returning to the place where my headquarters had been established</p>
<p>I met near them Ricketts&#x27;s division under General Keifer and General</p>
<p>Frank Wheaton&#x27;s division, both marching to the front.  When the men</p>
<p>of these divisions saw me they began cheering and took up the double</p>
<p>quick to the front, while I turned back toward Getty&#x27;s line to point</p>
<p>out where these returning troops should be placed.  Having done this,</p>
<p>I ordered General Wright to resume command of the Sixth Corps, and</p>
<p>Getty, who was temporarily in charge of it, to take command of his</p>
<p>own division.  A little later the Nineteenth Corps came up and was</p>
<p>posted between the right of the Sixth Corps and Middle Marsh Brook.</p>
<p>All this had consumed a great deal of time, and I concluded to visit</p>
<p>again the point to the east of the Valley pike, from where I had</p>
<p>first observed the enemy, to see what he was doing.  Arrived there, I</p>
<p>could plainly see him getting ready for attack, and Major Forsyth now</p>
<p>suggested that it would be well to ride along the line of battle</p>
<p>before the enemy assailed us, for although the troops had learned of</p>
<p>my return, but few of them had seen me.  Following his suggestion I</p>
<p>started in behind the men, but when a few paces had been taken I</p>
<p>crossed to the front and, hat in hand, passed along the entire length</p>
<p>of the infantry line; and it is from this circumstance that many of</p>
<p>the officers and men who then received me with such heartiness have</p>
<p>since supposed that that was my first appearance on the field.  But</p>
<p>at least two hours had elapsed since I reached the ground, for it was</p>
<p>after mid-day, when this incident of riding down the front took</p>
<p>place, and I arrived not later, certainly, than half-past 10 o&#x27;clock.</p>
<p>After re-arranging the line and preparing to attack I returned again</p>
<p>to observe the Confederates, who shortly began to advance on us.  The</p>
<p>attacking columns did not cover my entire front, and it appeared that</p>
<p>their onset would be mainly directed against the Nineteenth Corps,</p>
<p>so, fearing that they might be too strong for Emory on account of his</p>
<p>depleted condition (many of his men not having had time to get up</p>
<p>from the rear), and Getty&#x27;s division being free from assault I</p>
<p>transferred a part of it from the extreme left to the support of the</p>
<p>Nineteenth Corps.  The assault was quickly repulsed by Emory,</p>
<p>however, and as the enemy fell back Getty&#x27;s troops were returned to</p>
<p>their original place.  This repulse of the Confederates made me feel</p>
<p>pretty safe from further offensive operations on their part, and I</p>
<p>now decided to suspend the fighting till my thin ranks were further</p>
<p>strengthened by the men who were continually coming up from the rear,</p>
<p>and particularly till Crook&#x27;s troops could be assembled on the</p>
<p>extreme left.</p>
<p>In consequence of the despatch already mentioned, &quot;Be ready when I</p>
<p>join you, and we will crush Sheridan,&quot; since learned to have been</p>
<p>fictitious, I had been supposing all day that Longstreet&#x27;s troops</p>
<p>were present, but as no definite intelligence on this point had been</p>
<p>gathered, I concluded, in the lull that now occurred, to ascertain</p>
<p>something positive regarding Longstreet; and Merritt having been</p>
<p>transferred to our left in the morning, I directed him to attack an</p>
<p>exposed battery then at the edge of Middletown, and capture some</p>
<p>prisoners.  Merritt soon did this work effectually, concealing his</p>
<p>intention till his troops got close in to the enemy, and then by a</p>
<p>quick dash gobbling up a number of Confederates.  When the prisoners</p>
<p>were brought in, I learned from them that the only troops of</p>
<p>Longstreet&#x27;s in the fight were of Kershaw&#x27;s division, which had</p>
<p>rejoined Early at Brown&#x27;s Gap in the latter part of September, and</p>
<p>that the rest of Longstreet&#x27;s corps was not on the field.  The</p>
<p>receipt of this information entirely cleared the way for me to take</p>
<p>the offensive, but on the heels of it came information that</p>
<p>Longstreet was marching by the Front Royal pike to strike my rear at</p>
<p>Winchester, driving Powell&#x27;s cavalry in as he advanced.  This renewed</p>
<p>my uneasiness, and caused me to delay the general attack till after</p>
<p>assurances came from Powell denying utterly the reports as to</p>
<p>Longstreet, and confirming the statements of the prisoners.</p>
<p>Between half-past and 4 o&#x27;clock, I was ready to assail, and decided</p>
<p>to do so by advancing my infantry line in a swinging movement, so as</p>
<p>to gain the Valley pike with my right between Middletown and the</p>
<p>Belle Grove House; and when the order was passed along, the men</p>
<p>pushed steadily forward with enthusiasm and confidence.  General</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s troops extended some little distance beyond our right, and</p>
<p>when my flank neared the overlapping enemy, he turned on it, with the</p>
<p>effect of causing a momentary confusion, but General McMillan quickly</p>
<p>realizing the danger, broke the Confederates at the reentering angle</p>
<p>by a counter charge with his brigade, doing his work so well that the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s flanking troops were cut off from their main body and left to</p>
<p>shift for themselves.  Custer, who was just then moving in from the</p>
<p>west side of Middle Marsh Brook, followed McMillan&#x27;s timely blow with</p>
<p>a charge of cavalry, but before starting out on it, and while his men</p>
<p>were forming, riding at full speed himself, to throw his arms around</p>
<p>my neck.  By the time he had disengaged himself from this embrace,</p>
<p>the troops broken by McMillan had gained some little distance to</p>
<p>their rear, but Custer&#x27;s troopers sweeping across the Middletown</p>
<p>meadows and down toward Cedar Creek, took many of them prisoners</p>
<p>before they could reach the stream--so I forgave his delay.</p>
<p>My whole line as far as the eye could see was now driving everything</p>
<p>before it, from behind trees, stone walls, and all such sheltering</p>
<p>obstacles, so I rode toward the left to ascertain how matters were</p>
<p>getting on there.  As I passed along behind the advancing troops,</p>
<p>first General Grover, and then Colonel Mackenzie, rode up to welcome</p>
<p>me.  Both were severely wounded, and I told them to leave the field,</p>
<p>but they implored permission to remain till success was certain.</p>
<p>When I reached the Valley pike Crook had reorganized his men, and as</p>
<p>I desired that they should take part in the fight, for they were the</p>
<p>very same troops that had turned Early&#x27;s flank at Winchester and at</p>
<p>Fisher&#x27;s Hill, I ordered them to be pushed forward; and the alacrity</p>
<p>and celerity with which they moved on Middletown demonstrated that</p>
<p>their ill-fortune of the morning had not sprung from lack of valor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lowell&#x27;s brigade of cavalry, which, it will be remembered,</p>
<p>had been holding on, dismounted, just north of Middletown ever since</p>
<p>the time I arrived from Winchester, fell to the rear for the purpose</p>
<p>of getting their led horses.  A momentary panic was created in the</p>
<p>nearest brigade of infantry by this withdrawal of Lowell, but as soon</p>
<p>as his men were mounted they charged the enemy clear up to the stone</p>
<p>walls in the edge of Niiddletown; at sight of this the infantry</p>
<p>brigade renewed its attack, and the enemy&#x27;s right gave way.  The</p>
<p>accomplished Lowell received his death-wound in this courageous</p>
<p>charge.</p>
<p>All our troops were now moving on the retreating Confederates, and as</p>
<p>I rode to the front Colonel Gibbs, who succeeded Lowell, made ready</p>
<p>for another mounted charge, but I checked him from pressing the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s right, in the hope that the swinging attack from my right</p>
<p>would throw most of the Confederates to the east of the Valley pike,</p>
<p>and hence off their line of retreat through Strasburg to Fisher&#x27;s</p>
<p>Hill.  The eagerness of the men soon frustrated this anticipation,</p>
<p>however, the left insisting on keeping pace with the centre and</p>
<p>right, and all pushing ahead till we regained our old camps at Cedar</p>
<p>Creek.  Beyond Cedar Creek, at Strasburg, the pike makes a sharp turn</p>
<p>to the west toward Fisher&#x27;s Hill, and here Merritt uniting with</p>
<p>Custer, they together fell on the flank of the retreating columns,</p>
<p>taking many prisoners, wagons, and guns, among the prisoners being</p>
<p>Major-General Ramseur, who, mortally wounded, died the next day.</p>
<p>When the news of the victory was received, General Grant directed a</p>
<p>salute of one hundred shotted guns to be fired into Petersburg, and</p>
<p>the President at once thanked the army in an autograph letter.  A few</p>
<p>weeks after, he promoted me, and I received notice of this in a</p>
<p>special letter from the Secretary of War, saying:</p>
<p>&quot;that for the personal gallantry, military skill, and just confidence</p>
<p>in the courage and patriotism of your troops, displayed by you on the</p>
<p>19th day of October at Cedar Run, whereby, under the blessing of</p>
<p>Providence, your routed army was reorganized, a great National</p>
<p>disaster averted, and a brilliant victory achieved over the rebels</p>
<p>for the third time in pitched battle within thirty days, Philip H.</p>
<p>Sheridan is appointed a major-general in the United States Army.&quot;</p>
<p>The direct result of the battle was the recapture of all the</p>
<p>artillery, transportation, and camp equipage we had lost, and in</p>
<p>addition twenty-four pieces of the enemy&#x27;s artillery, twelve hundred</p>
<p>prisoners, and a number of battle-flags.  But more still flowed from</p>
<p>this victory, succeeding as it did the disaster of the morning, for</p>
<p>the reoccupation of our old camps at once re-established a morale</p>
<p>which for some hours had been greatly endangered by ill-fortune.</p>
<p>It was not till after the battle that I learned fully what had taken</p>
<p>place before my arrival, and then found that the enemy, having</p>
<p>gathered all the strength he could through the return of</p>
<p>convalescents and other absentees, had moved quietly from Fisher&#x27;s</p>
<p>Hill, in the night of the 18th and early on the morning of the 19th,</p>
<p>to surprise my army, which, it should be remembered, was posted on</p>
<p>the north bank of Cedar Creek, Crook holding on the left of the</p>
<p>Valley pike, with Thoburn&#x27;s division advanced toward the creek on</p>
<p>Duval&#x27;s (under Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes) and Kitching&#x27;s</p>
<p>provisional divisions to the north and rear of Thoburn.  The</p>
<p>Nineteenth Corps was on the right of Crook, extending in a semi-</p>
<p>circular line from the pike nearly to Meadow Brook, while the Sixth</p>
<p>Corps lay to the west of the brook in readiness to be used as a</p>
<p>movable column.  Merritt&#x27;s division was to the right and rear of the</p>
<p>Sixth Corps, and about a mile and a half west of Merrit was Custer</p>
<p>covering the fords of Cedar Creek as far west as the Middle road.</p>
<p>General Early&#x27;s plan was for one column under General Gordon,</p>
<p>consisting of three divisions of infantry (Gordon&#x27;s, Ramseur&#x27;s, and</p>
<p>Pegram&#x27;s), and Payne&#x27;s brigade of cavalry to cross the Shenandoah</p>
<p>River directly east of the Confederate works at Fisher&#x27;s Hill, march</p>
<p>around the northerly face of the Massanutten Mountain, and again</p>
<p>cross the Shenandoah at Bowman&#x27;s and McInturff&#x27;s fords.  Payne&#x27;s task</p>
<p>was to capture me at the Belle Grove House.  General Early himself,</p>
<p>with Kershaw&#x27;s and Wharton&#x27;s divisions, was to move through</p>
<p>Strasburg, Kershaw, accompanied by Early, to cross Cedar Creek at</p>
<p>Roberts&#x27;s ford and connect with Gordon, while Wharton was to continue</p>
<p>on the Valley pike to Hupp&#x27;s Hill and join the left of Kershaw, when</p>
<p>the crossing of the Valley pike over Cedar Creek became free.</p>
<p>Lomax&#x27;s cavalry, then in the Luray Valley, was ordered to join the</p>
<p>right of Gordon on the field of battle, while Rosser was to carry the</p>
<p>crossing of Cedar Creek on the Back road and attack Custer.  Early&#x27;s</p>
<p>conceptions were carried through in the darkness with little accident</p>
<p>or delay, Kershaw opening the fight by a furious attack on Thoburn&#x27;s</p>
<p>division, while at dawn and in a dense fog Gordon struck Crook&#x27;s</p>
<p>extreme left, surprising his pickets, and bursting into his camp with</p>
<p>such suddenness as to stampede Crook&#x27;s men.  Gordon directing his</p>
<p>march on my headquarters (the Belle Grove House), successfully turned</p>
<p>our position as he gained the Valley pike, and General Wright was</p>
<p>thus forced to order the withdrawal of the Nineteenth Corps from its</p>
<p>post at the Cedar Creek crossing, and this enabled Wharton to get</p>
<p>over the stream there unmolested and join Kershaw early in the</p>
<p>action.</p>
<p>After Crook&#x27;s troops had been driven from their camps, General Wright</p>
<p>endeavored to form a line with the Sixth Corps to hold the Valley</p>
<p>pike to the left of the Nineteenth, but failing in this he ordered</p>
<p>the withdrawal of the latter corps, Ricketts, temporarily commanding</p>
<p>the Sixth Corps, checking Gordon till Emory had retired.  As already</p>
<p>stated, Wharton was thus permitted to cross Cedar Creek on the pike,</p>
<p>and now that Early had a continuous line, he pressed his advantage so</p>
<p>vigorously that the whole Union army was soon driven from its camps</p>
<p>in more or less disorder; and though much disjointed resistance was</p>
<p>displayed, it may be said that no systematic stand was made until</p>
<p>Getty&#x27;s division, aided by Torbert&#x27;s cavalry, which Wright had</p>
<p>ordered to the left early in the action, took up the ground where, on</p>
<p>arriving from Winchester, I found them.</p>
<p>When I left my command on the 16th, little did I anticipate that</p>
<p>anything like this would happen.  Indeed, I felt satisfied that Early</p>
<p>was, of himself, too weak to take the offensive, and although I</p>
<p>doubted the Longstreet despatch, yet I was confident that, even</p>
<p>should it prove true, I could get back before the junction could be</p>
<p>made, and at the worst I felt certain that my army was equal to</p>
<p>confronting the forces of Longstreet and Early combined.  Still, the</p>
<p>surprise of the morning might have befallen me as well as the general</p>
<p>on whom it did descend, and though it is possible that this could</p>
<p>have been precluded had Powell&#x27;s cavalry been closed in, as suggested</p>
<p>in my despatch from Front Royal, yet the enemy&#x27;s desperation might</p>
<p>have prompted some other clever and ingenious scheme for relieving</p>
<p>his fallen fortunes in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>GENERAL EARLY REORGANIZES HIS FORCES--MOSBY THE GUERRILLA--GENERAL</p>
<p>MERRITT SENT TO OPERATE AGAINST MOSBY--ROSSER AGAIN ACTIVE--GENERAL</p>
<p>CUSTER SURPRISED--COLONEL YOUNG SENT TO CAPTURE GILMORE THE</p>

<p>GENERAL CROOK--SPIES--WAS WILKES BOOTH A SPY?--DRIVING THE</p>
<p>CONFEDERATES OUT OF THE VALLEY--THE BATTLE OF WAYNESBORO&#x27;--MARCHING</p>
<p>TO JOIN THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s broken army practically made no halt in its retreat after the</p>
<p>battle of Cedar-Creek until it reached New Market, though at Fisher&#x27;s</p>
<p>Hill was left a small rear-guard of cavalry, which hastily decamped,</p>
<p>however, when charged by Gibbs&#x27;s brigade on the morning of the 20th.</p>
<p>Between the date of his signal defeat and the 11th of November, the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s scattered forces had sufficiently reorganized to permit his</p>
<p>again making a reconnoissance in the valley as far north as Cedar</p>
<p>Creek, my army having meanwhile withdrawn to Kernstown, where it had</p>
<p>been finally decided that a defensive line should be held to enable</p>
<p>me to detach troops to General Grant, and where, by reconstructing</p>
<p>the Winchester and Potomac railroad from Stephenson&#x27;s depot to</p>
<p>Harper&#x27;s Ferry, my command might be more readily, supplied.  Early&#x27;s</p>
<p>reconnoissance north of Cedar Creek ended in a rapid withdrawal of</p>
<p>his infantry after feeling my front, and with the usual ill-fortune</p>
<p>to his cavalry; Merritt and Custer driving Rosser and Lomax with ease</p>
<p>across Cedar Creek on the Middle and Back roads, while Powell&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry struck McCausland near Stony Point, and after capturing two</p>
<p>pieces of artillery and about three hundred officers and men chased</p>
<p>him into the Luray Valley.</p>
<p>Early got back to New Market on the 14th of November, and, from lack</p>
<p>of subsistence, being unable to continue demonstrations to prevent my</p>
<p>reinforcement of General Grant, began himself to detach to General</p>
<p>Lee by returning Kershaw&#x27;s division to Petersburg, as was definitely</p>
<p>ascertained by Torbert in a reconnoissance to Mount Jackson.  At this</p>
<p>time General Grant wished me to send him the Sixth Corps, and it was</p>
<p>got ready for the purpose, but when I informed him that Torbert&#x27;s</p>
<p>reconnoissance had developed the fact that Early still retained four</p>
<p>divisions of infantry and one of cavalry, it was decided, on my</p>
<p>suggestion, to let the Sixth Corps remain till the season should be a</p>
<p>little further advanced, when the inclemency of the weather would</p>
<p>preclude infantry campaigning.  These conditions came about early in</p>
<p>December, and by the middle of the month the whole of the Sixth Corps</p>
<p>was at Petersburg; simultaneously with its transfer to that line</p>
<p>Early sending his Second Corps to Lee.</p>
<p>During the entire campaign I had been annoyed by guerrilla bands</p>
<p>under such partisan chiefs as Mosby, White, Gilmore, McNeil, and</p>
<p>others, and this had considerably depleted my line-of-battle</p>
<p>strength, necessitating as it did large, escorts for my supply-</p>
<p>trains.  The most redoubtable of these leaders was Mosby, whose force</p>
<p>was made up from the country around Upperville, east of the Blue</p>
<p>Ridge, to which section he always fled for a hiding-place when he</p>
<p>scented danger.  I had not directed any special operations against</p>
<p>these partisans while the campaign was active, but as Mosby&#x27;s men had</p>
<p>lately killed, within my lines, my chief quartermaster, Colonel</p>
<p>Tolles, and Medical Inspector Ohlenchlager, I concluded to devote</p>
<p>particular attention to these &quot;irregulars&quot; during the lull that now</p>
<p>occurred; so on the 28th of November, I directed General Merritt to</p>
<p>march to the Loudoun Valley and operate against Mosby, taking care to</p>
<p>clear the country of forage and subsistence, so as to prevent the</p>
<p>guerrillas from being harbored there in the future their destruction</p>
<p>or capture being well-nigh impossible, on account of their intimate</p>
<p>knowledge of the mountain region.  Merritt carried out his</p>
<p>instructions with his usual sagacity and thoroughness, sweeping</p>
<p>widely over each side of his general line of march with flankers, who</p>
<p>burned the grain and brought in large herds of cattle, hogs and</p>
<p>sheep, which were issued to the troops.</p>
<p>While Merritt was engaged in this service the Baltimore and Ohio</p>
<p>railroad once more received the attention of the enemy; Rosser, with</p>
<p>two brigades of cavalry, crossing the Great North Mountain, capturing</p>
<p>the post of New Creek, with about five hundred prisoners and seven</p>
<p>guns, destroying all the supplies of the garrison, and breaking up</p>
<p>the railroad track.  This slight success of the Confederates in West</p>
<p>Virginia, and the intelligence that they were contemplating further</p>
<p>raids in that section, led me to send, Crook there with one division,</p>
<p>his other troops going to City Point; and, I hoped that all the</p>
<p>threatened places would thus be sufficiently protected, but</p>
<p>negligence at Beverly resulted in the capture of that station by</p>
<p>Rosser on the 11th of January.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Early established himself with Wharton&#x27;s division</p>
<p>at Staunton in winter quarters, posting his cavalry in that</p>
<p>neighborhood also, except a detachment at New Market, and another</p>
<p>small one at the signalstation on Three Top Mountain.  The winter was</p>
<p>a most severe one, snow falling frequently to the depth of several</p>
<p>inches, and the mercury often sinking below zero.  The rigor of the</p>
<p>season was very much against the success of any mounted operations,</p>
<p>but General Grant being very desirous to have the railroads broken up</p>
<p>about Gordonsville and Charlottesville, on the 19th of December I</p>
<p>started the cavalry out for that purpose, Torbert, with Merritt and</p>
<p>Powell, marching through Chester Gap, while Custer moved toward</p>
<p>Staunton to make a demonstration in Torbert&#x27;s favor, hoping to hold</p>
<p>the enemy&#x27;s troops in the valley.  Unfortunately, Custer did not</p>
<p>accomplish all that was expected of him, and being surprised by</p>
<p>Rosser and Payne near Lacy&#x27;s Springs before reveille, had to abandon</p>
<p>his bivouac and retreat down the valley, with the loss of a number of</p>
<p>prisoners, a few horses, and a good many horse equipments, for,</p>
<p>because of the suddenness of Rosser&#x27;s attack, many of the men had no</p>
<p>time to saddle up.  As soon as Custer&#x27;s retreat was assured,</p>
<p>Wharton&#x27;s division of infantry was sent to Charlottesville to check</p>
<p>Torbert, but this had already been done by Lomax, with the assistance</p>
<p>of infantry sent up from Richmond.  Indeed, from the very beginning</p>
<p>of the movement the Confederates had been closely observing the</p>
<p>columns of Torbert and Custer, and in consequence of the knowledge</p>
<p>thus derived, Early had marched Lomax to Gordonsville in anticipation</p>
<p>of an attack there, at the same time sending Rosser down the valley</p>
<p>to meet Custer.  Torbert in the performance of his task captured two</p>
<p>pieces of artillery from Johnson&#x27;s and McCausland&#x27;s brigades, at</p>
<p>Liberty Mills on the Rapidan River, but in the main the purpose of</p>
<p>the raid utterly failed, so by the 27th of December he returned,</p>
<p>many, of his men badly frost-bitten from the extreme cold which had</p>
<p>prevailed.</p>
<p>This expedition practically closed all operations for the season, and</p>
<p>the cavalry was put into winter cantonment near Winchester.  The</p>
<p>distribution of my infantry to Petersburg and West Virginia left with</p>
<p>me in the beginning of the new year, as already stated, but the one</p>
<p>small division of the Nineteenth Corps.  On account of this</p>
<p>diminution of force, it became necessary for me to keep thoroughly</p>
<p>posted in regard to the enemy, and I now realized more than I had</p>
<p>done hitherto how efficient my scouts had become since under the</p>
<p>control of Colonel Young; for not only did they bring me almost every</p>
<p>day intelligence from within Early&#x27;s lines, but they also operated</p>
<p>efficiently against the guerrillas infesting West Virginia.</p>
<p>Harry Gilmore, of Maryland, was the most noted of these since the</p>
<p>death of McNeil, and as the scouts had reported him in Harrisonburg</p>
<p>the latter part of January, I directed two of the most trustworthy to</p>
<p>be sent to watch his movements and ascertain his purposes.  In a few</p>
<p>days these spies returned with the intelligence that Gilmore was on</p>
<p>his way to Moorefield, the centre of a very disloyal section in West</p>
<p>Virginia, about ninety miles southwest of Winchester, where, under</p>
<p>the guise of a camp-meeting, a gathering was to take place, at which</p>
<p>he expected to enlist a number of men, be joined by a party of about</p>
<p>twenty recruits coming from Maryland, and then begin depredations</p>
<p>along the Baltimore and Ohio railroad.  Believing that Gilmore might</p>
<p>be captured, I directed Young to undertake the task, and as a</p>
<p>preliminary step he sent to Moorefield two of his men who early in</p>
<p>the war had &quot;refugeed&quot; from that section and enlisted in one of the</p>
<p>Union regiments from West Virginia.  In about a week these men came</p>
<p>back and reported that Gilmore was living at a house between three</p>
<p>and four miles from Moorefield, and gave full particulars as to his</p>
<p>coming and going, the number of men he had about there and where they</p>
<p>rendezvoused.</p>
<p>With this knowledge at hand I directed Young to take twenty of his</p>
<p>best men and leave that night for Moorefield, dressed in Confederate</p>
<p>uniforms, telling him that I would have about three hundred cavalry</p>
<p>follow in his wake when he had got about fifteen miles start, and</p>
<p>instructing him to pass his party off as a body of recruits for</p>
<p>Gilmore coming from Maryland and pursued by the Yankee cavalry.  I</p>
<p>knew this would allay suspicion and provide him help on the road;</p>
<p>and, indeed, as Colonel Whittaker, who alone knew the secret,</p>
<p>followed after the fleeing &quot;Marylanders,&quot; he found that their advent</p>
<p>had caused so little remark that the trail would have been lost had</p>
<p>he not already known their destination.  Young met with a hearty,</p>
<p>welcome wherever he halted on the way, and as he passed through the</p>
<p>town of Moorefield learned with satisfaction that Gilmore still made</p>
<p>his headquarters at the house where the report of the two scouts had</p>
<p>located him a few days before.  Reaching the designated place about</p>
<p>12 o&#x27;clock on the night of the 5th of February, Young, under the</p>
<p>representation that he had come directly from Maryland and was being</p>
<p>pursued by the Union cavalry, gained immediate access to Gilmore&#x27;s</p>
<p>room.  He found the bold guerrilla snugly tucked in bed, with two</p>
<p>pistols lying on a chair near by.  He was sleeping so soundly that to</p>
<p>arouse him Young had to give him a violent shake.  As he awoke and</p>
<p>asked who was disturbing his slumbers, Young, pointing at him a</p>
<p>cocked six-shooter, ordered him to dress without delay, and in answer</p>
<p>to his inquiry, informed him that he was a prisoner to one of</p>
<p>Sheridan&#x27;s staff.  Meanwhile Gilmore&#x27;s men had learned of his</p>
<p>trouble, but the early appearance of Colonel Whittaker caused them to</p>
<p>disperse; thus the last link between Maryland and the Confederacy was</p>
<p>carried a prisoner to Winchester, whence he was sent to Fort Warren.</p>
<p>The capture of Gilmore caused the disbandment of the party he had</p>
<p>organized at the &quot;camp-meeting,&quot; most of the men he had recruited</p>
<p>returning to their homes discouraged, though some few joined the</p>
<p>bands of Woodson and young Jesse McNeil, which, led by the latter,</p>
<p>dashed into Cumberland, Maryland, at 3 O&#x27;clock on the morning of the</p>
<p>21st of February and made a reprisal by carrying off General Crook</p>
<p>and General Kelly, and doing their work so silently and quickly that</p>
<p>they escaped without being noticed, and were some distance on their</p>
<p>way before the colored watchman at the hotel where Crook was</p>
<p>quartered could compose himself enough to give the alarm.  A troop of</p>
<p>cavalry gave hot chase from Cumberland, striving to intercept the</p>
<p>party at Moorefield and other points, but all efforts were fruitless,</p>
<p>the prisoners soon being beyond reach.</p>
<p>Although I had adopted the general rule of employing only soldiers as</p>
<p>scouts, there was an occasional exception to it.  I cannot say that</p>
<p>these exceptions proved wholly that an ironclad observance of the</p>
<p>rule would have been best, but I am sure of it in one instance.  A</p>
<p>man named Lomas, who claimed to be a Marylander, offered me his</p>
<p>services as a spy, and coming highly recommended from Mr. Stanton,</p>
<p>who had made use of him in that capacity, I employed him.  He made</p>
<p>many pretensions, often appearing over anxious to impart information</p>
<p>seemingly intended to impress me with his importance, and yet was</p>
<p>more than ordinarily intelligent, but in spite of that my confidence</p>
<p>in him was by no means unlimited.  I often found what he reported to</p>
<p>me as taking place within the Confederate lines corroborated by</p>
<p>Young&#x27;s men, but generally there were discrepancies in his tales,</p>
<p>which led me to suspect that he was employed by the enemy as well as</p>
<p>by me.  I felt, however, that with good watching he could do me</p>
<p>little harm, and if my suspicions were incorrect he might be very</p>
<p>useful, so I held on to him.</p>
<p>Early in February Lomas was very solicitous for me to employ a man</p>
<p>who, he said, had been with Mosby, but on account of some quarrel in</p>
<p>the irregular camp had abandoned that leader.  Thinking that with two</p>
<p>of them I might destroy the railroad bridges east of Lynchburg, I</p>
<p>concluded, after the Mosby man had been brought to my headquarters by</p>
<p>Lomas about 12 o&#x27;clock one night, to give him employment, at the same</p>
<p>time informing Colonel Young that I suspected their fidelity,</p>
<p>however, and that he must test it by shadowing their every movement.</p>
<p>When Lomas&#x27;s companion entered my room he was completely disguised,</p>
<p>but on discarding the various contrivances by which his identity was</p>
<p>concealed he proved to be a rather slender, dark-complexioned,</p>
<p>handsome young man, of easy address and captivating manners.  He gave</p>
<p>his name as Renfrew, answered all my questions satisfactorily, and</p>
<p>went into details about Mosby and his men which showed an intimacy</p>
<p>with them at some time.  I explained to the two men the work I had</p>
<p>laid out for them, and stated the sum of money I would give to have</p>
<p>it done, but stipulated that in case of failure there would be no</p>
<p>compensation whatever beyond the few dollars necessary for their</p>
<p>expenses.  They readily assented, and it was arranged that they</p>
<p>should start the following night.  Meanwhile Young had selected his</p>
<p>men to shadow them, and in two days reported my spies as being</p>
<p>concealed at Strasburg, where they remained, without making the</p>
<p>slightest effort to continue on their mission, and were busy, no</p>
<p>doubt, communicating with the enemy, though I was not able to fasten</p>
<p>this on them.  On the 16th of February they returned to Winchester,</p>
<p>and reported their failure, telling so many lies about their</p>
<p>hazardous adventure as to remove all remaining doubt as to their</p>
<p>double-dealing.  Unquestionably they were spies from the enemy, and</p>
<p>hence liable to the usual penalties of such service; but it struck me</p>
<p>that through them, I might deceive Early as to the time of opening</p>
<p>the spring campaign, I having already received from General Grant an</p>
<p>intimation of what was expected of me.  I therefore retained the men</p>
<p>without even a suggestion of my knowledge of their true character,</p>
<p>Young meanwhile keeping close watch over all their doings.</p>
<p>Toward the last of February General Early had at Staunton two</p>
<p>brigades of infantry under Wharton.  All the rest of the infantry</p>
<p>except Echol&#x27;s brigade, which was in southwestern Virginia, had been</p>
<p>sent to Petersburg during the winter, and Fitz. Lee&#x27;s two brigades of</p>
<p>cavalry also.  Rosser&#x27;s men were mostly at their homes, where, on</p>
<p>account of a lack of subsistence and forage in the valley, they had</p>
<p>been permitted to go, subject to call.  Lomax&#x27;s cavalry was at</p>
<p>Millboro&#x27;, west of Staunton, where supplies were obtainable.  It was</p>
<p>my aim to get well on the road before Early could collect these</p>
<p>scattered forces, and as many of the officers had been in the habit</p>
<p>of amusing themselves fox-hunting during the latter part of the</p>
<p>winter, I decided to use the hunt as an expedient for stealing a</p>
<p>march on the enemy, and had it given out officially that a grand fox-</p>
<p>chase would take place on the 29th of February.  Knowing that Lomas,</p>
<p>and Renfrew would spread the announcement South, they were permitted</p>
<p>to see several red foxes that had been secured, as well as a large</p>
<p>pack of hounds which Colonel Young had collected for the sport, and</p>
<p>were then started on a second expedition to burn the bridges.  Of</p>
<p>course, they were shadowed as usual, and two days later, after they</p>
<p>had communicated with friends from their hiding-place, in Newtown,</p>
<p>they were arrested.  On the way north to Fort Warren they escaped</p>
<p>from their guards when passing through Baltimore, and I never heard</p>
<p>of them again, though I learned that, after the assassination of, Mr.</p>
<p>Lincoln, Secretary Stanton strongly suspected his friend Lomas of</p>
<p>being associated with the conspirators, and it then occurred to me</p>
<p>that the good-looking Renfrew may have been Wilkes Booth, for he</p>
<p>certainly bore a strong resemblance to Booth&#x27;s pictures.</p>
<p>On the 27th of February my cavalry entered upon the campaign which</p>
<p>cleared the Shenandoah Valley of every remnant of organized</p>
<p>Confederates.  General Torbert being absent on leave at this time, I</p>
<p>did not recall him, but appointed General Merritt Chief of Cavalry.</p>
<p>for Torbert had disappointed me on two important occasions--in the</p>
<p>Luray Valley during the battle of Fisher&#x27;s Hill, and on the recent</p>
<p>Gordonsville expedition--and I mistrusted his ability to conduct any</p>
<p>operations requiring much self-reliance.  The column was composed of</p>
<p>Custer&#x27;s and Devin&#x27;s divisions of cavalry, and two sections of</p>
<p>artillery, comprising in all about 10,000 officers and men.  On</p>
<p>wheels we had, to accompany this column, eight ambulances, sixteen</p>
<p>ammunition wagons, a pontoon train for eight canvas boats, and a</p>
<p>small supply-train, with fifteen days&#x27; rations of coffee, sugar, and</p>
<p>salt, it being intended to depend on the country for the meat and</p>
<p>bread ration, the men carrying in their haversacks nearly enough to</p>
<p>subsist them till out of the exhausted valley.</p>
<p>Grant&#x27;s orders were for me to destroy the Virginia Central railroad</p>
<p>and the James River canal, capture Lynchburg if practicable, and then</p>
<p>join General Sherman in North Carolina wherever he might be found, or</p>
<p>return to Winchester, but as to joining Sherman I was to be governed</p>
<p>by the state of affairs after the projected capture of Lynchburg.</p>
<p>The weather was cold, the valley and surrounding mountains being</p>
<p>still covered with snow; but this was fast disappearing, however,</p>
<p>under the heavy rain that was coming down as the column moved along</p>
<p>up the Valley pike at a steady gait that took us to Woodstock the</p>
<p>first day.  The second day we crossed the North Fork of the</p>
<p>Shenandoah on our pontoon-bridge, and by night-fall reached Lacy&#x27;s</p>
<p>Springs, having seen nothing of the enemy as yet but a few partisans</p>
<p>who hung on our flanks in the afternoon.</p>
<p>March 1 we encountered General Rosser at Mt Crawford, he having been</p>
<p>able to call together only some five or six hundred of his troops,</p>
<p>our unsuspected march becoming known to Early only the day before.</p>
<p>Rosser attempted to delay us here, trying to burn the bridges over</p>
<p>the Middle Fork of the Shenandoah, but two regiments from Colonel</p>
<p>Capehart&#x27;s brigade swam the stream and drove Rosser to Kline&#x27;s Mills,</p>
<p>taking thirty prisoners and twenty ambulances and wagons.</p>
<p>Meanwhile General Early was busy at Staunton, but not knowing my</p>
<p>objective point, he had ordered the return of Echol&#x27;s brigade from</p>
<p>southwestern Virginia for the protection of Lynchburg, directed</p>
<p>Lomax&#x27;s cavalry to concentrate at Pond Gap for the purpose of</p>
<p>harassing me if I moved toward Lynchburg, and at the same time</p>
<p>marched Wharton&#x27;s two brigades of infantry, Nelson&#x27;s artillery, and</p>
<p>Rosser&#x27;s cavalry to Waynesboro&#x27;, whither he went also to remain till</p>
<p>the object of my movement was ascertained.</p>
<p>I entered Staunton the morning of March 2, and finding that Early had</p>
<p>gone to Waynesboro&#x27; with his infantry and Rosser, the question at</p>
<p>once arose whether I should continue my march to Lynchburg direct,</p>
<p>leaving my adversary in my rear, or turn east and open the way</p>
<p>through Rockfish Gap to the Virginia Central railroad and James River</p>
<p>canal.  I felt confident of the success of the latter plan, for I</p>
<p>knew that Early numbered there not more than two thousand men; so,</p>
<p>influenced by this, and somewhat also by the fact that Early had left</p>
<p>word in Staunton that he would fight at Waynesboro&#x27;, I directed</p>
<p>Merritt to move toward that place with Custer, to be closely followed</p>
<p>by Devin, who was to detach one brigade to destroy supplies at</p>
<p>Swoope&#x27;s&#x27;depot.  The by-roads were miry beyond description, rain</p>
<p>having fallen almost incessantly since we left Winchester, but</p>
<p>notwithstanding the down-pour the column pushed on, men and horses</p>
<p>growing almost unrecognizable from the mud covering them from head to</p>
<p>foot.</p>
<p>General Early was true to the promise made his friends in Staunton,</p>
<p>for when Custer neared Waynesboro&#x27; he found, occupying a line of</p>
<p>breastworks on a ridge west of the town, two brigades of infantry,</p>
<p>with eleven pieces of artillery and Rosser&#x27;s cavalry.  Custer, when</p>
<p>developing the position of the Confederates, discovered that their</p>
<p>left was somewhat exposed instead of resting on South River; he</p>
<p>therefore made his dispositions for attack, sending around that flank</p>
<p>the dismounted regiments from Pennington&#x27;s brigade, while he himself,</p>
<p>with two brigades, partly mounted and partly dismounted, assaulted</p>
<p>along the whole line of breastworks.  Pennington&#x27;s flanking movement</p>
<p>stampeded the enemy in short order, thus enabling Custer to carry the</p>
<p>front with little resistance, and as he did so the Eighth New York</p>
<p>and First Connecticut, in a charge in column, broke through the</p>
<p>opening made by Custer, and continued on through the town of</p>
<p>Waynesboro&#x27;, never stopping till they crossed South River.  There,</p>
<p>finding themselves immediately in the enemy&#x27;s rear, they promptly</p>
<p>formed as foragers and held the east bank of the stream till all the</p>
<p>Confederates surrendered except Rosser, who succeeded in making his</p>
<p>way back to the valley, and Generals Early, Wharton, Long, and</p>
<p>Lilley, who, with fifteen or twenty men, escaped across the Blue</p>
<p>Ridge.  I followed up the victory immediately by despatching Capehart</p>
<p>through Rock-fish Gap, with orders to encamp on the east side of the</p>
<p>Blue Ridge.  By reason of this move all the enemy&#x27;s stores and</p>
<p>transportation fell into our hands, while we captured on the field</p>
<p>seventeen battle flags, sixteen hundred officers and men, and eleven</p>
<p>pieces of artillery.  This decisive victory closed hostilities in the</p>
<p>Shenandoah Valley.  The prisoners and artillery were sent back to</p>
<p>Winchester next morning, under a guard of 1,500 men, commanded by</p>
<p>Colonel J.  H.  Thompson, of the First New Hampshire.</p>
<p>The night of March 2 Custer camped at Brookfield, Devin remaining at</p>
<p>Waynesboro&#x27;.  The former started for Charlottesville the next morning</p>
<p>early, followed by Devin with but two brigades, Gibbs having been</p>
<p>left behind to blow up the iron railroad bridge across South River.</p>
<p>Because of the incessant rains and spring thaws the roads were very</p>
<p>soft, and the columns cut them up terribly, the mud being thrown by</p>
<p>the sets of fours across the road in ridges as much as two feet high,</p>
<p>making it most difficult to get our wagons along, and distressingly</p>
<p>wearing on the animals toward the middle and rear of the columns.</p>
<p>Consequently I concluded to rest at Charlottesville for a couple of</p>
<p>days and recuperate a little, intending at the same time to destroy,</p>
<p>with small parties, the railroad from that point toward Lynchburg.</p>
<p>Custer reached Charlottesville the 3d, in the afternoon, and was met</p>
<p>at the outskirts by a deputation of its citizens, headed by the</p>
<p>mayor, who surrendered the town with medieval ceremony, formally</p>
<p>handing over the keys of the public buildings and of the University</p>
<p>of Virginia.  But this little scene did not delay Custer long enough</p>
<p>to prevent his capturing, just beyond the village, a small body of</p>
<p>cavalry and three pieces of artillery.  Gibbs&#x27;s brigade, which was</p>
<p>bringing up my mud-impeded train, did not arrive until the 5th of</p>
<p>March.  In the mean time Young&#x27;s scouts had brought word that the</p>
<p>garrison of Lynchburg was being increased and the fortifications</p>
<p>strengthened, so that its capture would be improbable.  I decided,</p>
<p>however, to move toward the place as far as Amherst Court House,</p>
<p>which is sixteen miles short of the town, so Devin, under Merritt&#x27;s</p>
<p>supervision, marched along the James River, destroying the canal,</p>
<p>while Custer pushed ahead on the railroad and broke it up.  The two</p>
<p>columns were to join at New Market, whence I intended to cross the</p>
<p>James River at some point east of Lynchburg, if practicable, so as to</p>
<p>make my way to Appomattox Court House, and destroy the Southside</p>
<p>railroad as far east as Farmville.  Owing to its swollen condition</p>
<p>the river was unfordable but knowing that there was a covered bridge</p>
<p>at Duguidsville, I hoped to secure it by a dash, and cross there, but</p>
<p>the enemy, anticipating this, had filled the bridge with inflammable</p>
<p>material, and just as our troops got within striking distance it</p>
<p>burst into flames.  The bridge at Hardwicksville also having been</p>
<p>burned by the enemy, there was now no means of crossing except by</p>
<p>pontoons.  but, unfortunately, I had only eight of these, and they</p>
<p>could not be made to span the swollen river.</p>
<p>Being thus unable to cross until the river should fall, and knowing</p>
<p>that it was impracticable to join General Sherman, and useless to</p>
<p>adhere to my alternative instructions to return to Winchester, I now</p>
<p>decided to destroy still more thoroughly the James River canal and</p>
<p>the Virginia Central railroad and then join General Grant in front of</p>
<p>Petersburg.  I was master of the whole country north of the James as</p>
<p>far down as Goochland; hence the destruction of these arteries of</p>
<p>supply could be easily compassed, and feeling that the war was</p>
<p>nearing its end, I desired my cavalry to be in at the death.</p>
<p>On March 9 the main column started eastward down the James River,</p>
<p>destroying locks, dams, and boats, having been preceded by Colonel</p>
<p>Fitzhugh&#x27;s brigade of Devin&#x27;s division in a forced march to Goochland</p>
<p>and Beaver Dam Creek, with orders to destroy everything below</p>
<p>Columbia.  I made Columbia on the 10th, and from there sent a</p>
<p>communication to General Grant reporting what had occurred, informing</p>
<p>him of my condition and intention, asking him to send forage and</p>
<p>rations to meet me at the White House, and also a pontoon-bridge to</p>
<p>carry me over the Pamunkey, for in view of the fact that hitherto it</p>
<p>had been impracticable to hold Lee in the trenches around Petersburg,</p>
<p>I regarded as too hazardous a march down the south bank of the</p>
<p>Pamunkey, where the enemy, by sending troops out from Richmond, might</p>
<p>fall upon my flank and rear.  It was of the utmost importance that</p>
<p>General Grant should receive these despatches without chance of</p>
<p>failure, in order that I might, depend absolutely on securing</p>
<p>supplies at the White House; therefore I sent the message in</p>
<p>duplicate, one copy overland direct to City Point by two scouts,</p>
<p>Campbell and Rowan, and the other by Fannin and Moore, who were to go</p>
<p>down the James River in a small boat to Richmond, join the troops in</p>
<p>the trenches in front of Petersburg, and, deserting to the Union</p>
<p>lines, deliver their tidings into General Grant&#x27;s hands.  Each set of</p>
<p>messengers got through, but the copy confided to Campbell and Rowan</p>
<p>was first at Grant&#x27;s headquarters.</p>
<p>I halted for one day at Columbia to let my trains catch up, for it</p>
<p>was still raining and the mud greatly delayed the teams, fatiguing</p>
<p>and wearying the mules so much that I believe we should have been</p>
<p>forced to abandon most of the wagons except for the invaluable help</p>
<p>given by some two thousand negroes who had attached themselves to the</p>
<p>column: they literally lifted the wagons out of the mud.  From</p>
<p>Columbia Merritt, with Devin&#x27;s division, marched to Louisa Court</p>
<p>House and destroyed the Virginia Central to Frederick&#x27;s Hall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Custer was performing similar work from Frederick&#x27;s Hall to</p>
<p>Beaver Dam Station, and also pursued for a time General Early, who,</p>
<p>it was learned from despatches captured in the telegraph office at</p>
<p>Frederick&#x27;s Hall, was in the neighborhood with a couple of hundred</p>
<p>men.  Custer captured some of these men and two of Early&#x27;s staff-</p>
<p>officers, but the commander of the Valley District, accompanied by a</p>
<p>single orderly, escaped across the South Anna and next day made his</p>
<p>way to Richmond, the last man of the Confederate army that had so</p>
<p>long contended with us in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>At Frederick&#x27;s Hall, Young&#x27;s scouts brought me word from Richmond</p>
<p>that General Longstreet was assembling a force there to prevent my</p>
<p>junction with Grant, and that Pickett&#x27;s division, which had been sent</p>
<p>toward Lynchburg to oppose my march, and Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry, were</p>
<p>moving east on the Southside railroad, with the object of</p>
<p>circumventing me.  Reasoning that Longstreet could interpose</p>
<p>effectually only by getting to the White House ahead of me, I pushed</p>
<p>one column under Custer across the South Anna, by way of Ground</p>
<p>Squirrel bridge, to Ashland, where it united with Merritt, who had</p>
<p>meanwhile marched through Hanover Junction.  Our appearance at</p>
<p>Ashland drew the Confederates out in that direction, as was hoped,</p>
<p>so, leaving Colonel Pennington&#x27;s brigade there to amuse them, the</p>
<p>united command retraced its route to Mount Carmel church to cross the</p>
<p>North Anna.  After dark Pennington came away, and all the troops</p>
<p>reached the church by midnight of the 15th.</p>
<p>Resuming the march at an early hour next morning, we took the road by</p>
<p>way of King William Court House to the White House, where, arriving</p>
<p>on the 18th, we found, greatly to our relief, the supplies which I</p>
<p>had requested to be sent there.  In the meanwhile the enemy had</p>
<p>marched to Hanover Court House, but being unable either to cross the</p>
<p>Pamunkey there or forestall me at the White House on the south side</p>
<p>of the river, he withdrew to Richmond without further effort to</p>
<p>impede my column.</p>
<p>The hardships of this march far exceeded those of any previous</p>
<p>campaigns by the cavalry.  Almost incessant rains had drenched us for</p>
<p>sixteen days and nights, and the swollen streams and well-nigh</p>
<p>bottomless roads east of Staunton presented grave difficulties on</p>
<p>every hand, but surmounting them all, we destroyed the enemy&#x27;s means</p>
<p>of subsistence, in quantities beyond computation, and permanently</p>
<p>crippled the Virginia Central railroad, as well as the James River</p>
<p>canal, and as each day brought us nearer the Army of the Potomac, all</p>
<p>were filled with the comforting reflection that our work in the</p>
<p>Shenandoah Valley had been thoroughly done, and every one was buoyed</p>
<p>up by the cheering thought that we should soon take part in the final</p>
<p>struggle of the war.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>TRANSFERRED TO PETERSBURG--GENERAL RAWLINS CORDIAL WELCOME--GENERAL</p>
<p>GRANT&#x27;s ORDERS AND PLANS--A TRIP WITH MR. LINCOLN AND GENERAL GRANT--</p>
<p>MEETING GENERAL SHERMAN--OPPOSED TO JOINING THE ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE</p>
<p>--OPENING OF THE APPOMATTOX CAMPAIGN--GENERAL GRANT AND GENERAL</p>
<p>RAWLINS.</p>
<p>The transfer of my command from the Shenandoah Valley to the field of</p>
<p>operations in front of Petersburg was not anticipated by General</p>
<p>Grant; indeed, the despatch brought from Columbia by my scouts,</p>
<p>asking that supplies be sent me at the White House, was the first</p>
<p>word that reached him concerning the move.  In view of my message the</p>
<p>general-in-chief decided to wait my arrival before beginning spring</p>
<p>operations with the investing troops south of the James River, for he</p>
<p>felt the importance of having my cavalry at hand in a campaign which</p>
<p>he was convinced would wind up the war.  We remained a few days at</p>
<p>the White House resting and refitting the cavalry, a large amount of</p>
<p>shoeing being necessary; but nothing like enough horses were at hand</p>
<p>to replace those that had died or been disabled on the mud march from</p>
<p>Staunton to the Pamunkey River, so a good many of the men were still</p>
<p>without mounts, and all such were sent by boat to the dismounted camp</p>
<p>near City Point.  When all was ready the column set out for Hancock</p>
<p>Station, a point on the military railroad in front of Petersburg, and</p>
<p>arriving there on the 27th of March, was in orders reunited with its</p>
<p>comrades of the Second Division, who had been serving with the Army</p>
<p>of the Potomac since we parted from them the previous August.</p>
<p>General Crook, who had been exchanged within a few days, was now in</p>
<p>command of this Second Division.  The reunited corps was to enter</p>
<p>upon the campaign as a separate army, I reporting directly to General</p>
<p>Grant; the intention being thus to reward me for foregoing, of my own</p>
<p>choice, my position as a department commander by joining the armies</p>
<p>at Petersburg.</p>
<p>Taking the road across the Peninsula, I started from the White House</p>
<p>with Merritt&#x27;s column on the 25th of March and encamped that night at</p>
<p>Harrison&#x27;s Landing.  Very early next morning, in conformity with a</p>
<p>request from General Grant, I left by boat for City Point, Merritt</p>
<p>meanwhile conducting the column across the James River to the point</p>
<p>of rendezvous, The trip to City Point did not take long, and on</p>
<p>arrival at army headquarters the first person I met was General John</p>
<p>A. Rawlins, General Grant&#x27;s chief-of-staff.  Rawlins was a man of</p>
<p>strong likes and dislikes, and positive always both in speech and</p>
<p>action, exhibiting marked feelings when greeting any one, and on this</p>
<p>occasion met me with much warmth.  His demonstrations of welcome</p>
<p>over, we held a few minutes&#x27; conversation about the coming campaign,</p>
<p>he taking strong ground against a part of the plan of operations</p>
<p>adopted, namely, that which contemplated my joining General Sherman&#x27;s</p>
<p>army.  His language was unequivocal and vehement, and when he was</p>
<p>through talking, he conducted me to General Grant&#x27;s quarters, but he</p>
<p>himself did not enter.</p>
<p>General Grant was never impulsive, and always met his officers in an</p>
<p>unceremonious way, with a quiet &quot;How are you&quot; soon putting one at his</p>
<p>ease, since the pleasant tone in which he spoke gave assurance of</p>
<p>welcome, although his manner was otherwise impassive.  When the</p>
<p>ordinary greeting was over, he usually waited for his visitor to open</p>
<p>the conversation, so on this occasion I began by giving him the</p>
<p>details of my march from Winchester, my reasons for not joining</p>
<p>Sherman, as contemplated in my instructions, and the motives which</p>
<p>had influenced me to march to the White House.  The other provision</p>
<p>of my orders on setting out from Winchester--the alternative return</p>
<p>to that place--was not touched upon, for the wisdom of having ignored</p>
<p>that was fully apparent.  Commenting on this recital of my doings,</p>
<p>the General referred only to the tortuous course of my march from</p>
<p>Waynesboro&#x27; down, our sore trials, and the valuable services of the</p>
<p>scouts who had brought him tidings of me, closing with the remark</p>
<p>that it was, rare a department commander voluntarily deprived himself</p>
<p>of independence, and added that I should not suffer for it.  Then</p>
<p>turning to the business for which he had called rne to City Point, he</p>
<p>outlined what he expected me to do; saying that I was to cut loose</p>
<p>from the Army of the Potomac by passing its left flank to the</p>
<p>southward along the line of the Danville railroad, and after crossing</p>
<p>the Roanoke River, join General Sherman.  While speaking, he handed</p>
<p>me a copy of a general letter of instructions that had been drawn up</p>
<p>for the army on the 24th.  The letter contained these words</p>
<p>concerning the movements of my command:</p>
<p>&quot;The cavalry under General Sheridan, joined by the division now under</p>
<p>General Davies, will move at the same time (29th inst.) by the Weldon</p>
<p>road and the Jerusalem plank-road, turning west from the latter</p>
<p>before crossing the Nottoway, and west with the whole column before</p>
<p>reaching Stony Creek.  General Sheridan will then move independently</p>
<p>under other instructions which will be given him.  All dismounted</p>
<p>cavalry belonging to the Army of the Potomac, and the dismounted</p>
<p>cavalry from the Middle Military Division not required for guarding</p>
<p>property belonging to their arm of the service, will report to</p>
<p>Brigadier-General Benham to be added to the defenses of City Point.&quot;</p>
<p>When I had gone over the entire letter I showed plainly that I was</p>
<p>dissatisfied with it, for, coupled with what the General had outlined</p>
<p>orally, which I supposed was the &quot;other instructions,&quot; I believed it</p>
<p>foreshadowed my junction with General Sherman.  Rawlins thought so</p>
<p>too, as his vigorous language had left no room to doubt, so I</p>
<p>immediately began to offer my objections to the programme.  These</p>
<p>were, that it would be bad policy to send me down to the Carolinas</p>
<p>with a part of the Army of the Potomac, to come back to crush Lee</p>
<p>after the destruction of General Johnston&#x27;s army; such a course would</p>
<p>give rise to the charge that his own forces around Petersburg were</p>
<p>not equal to the task, and would seriously affect public opinion in</p>
<p>the North; that in fact my cavalry belonged to the Army of the</p>
<p>Potomac, which army was able unaided to destroy Lee, and I could not</p>
<p>but oppose any dispersion of its strength.</p>
<p>All this was said in a somewhat emphatic manner, and when I had</p>
<p>finished he quietly told me that the portion of my instructions from</p>
<p>which I so strongly dissented was intended as a &quot;blind&quot; to cover any</p>
<p>check the army in its general move, to the left might meet with, and</p>
<p>prevent that element in the North which held that the war could be</p>
<p>ended only through negotiation, from charging defeat.  The fact that</p>
<p>my cavalry was not to ultimately join Sherman was a great relief to</p>
<p>me, and after expressing the utmost confidence in the plans unfolded</p>
<p>for closing the war by directing every effort to the annihilation of</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s army, I left him to go to General Ingalls&#x27;s quarters.  On the</p>
<p>way I again met Rawlins, who, when I told him that General Grant had</p>
<p>intimated his intention to modify the written plan of operations so</p>
<p>far as regarded the cavalry, manifested the greatest satisfaction,</p>
<p>and I judged from this that the new view of the matter had not</p>
<p>previously been communicated to the chief-of-staff, though he must</p>
<p>have been acquainted of course with the programme made out on the</p>
<p>24th of March.</p>
<p>Toward noon General Grant sent for me to accompany him up the river.</p>
<p>When I joined the General he informed me that the President was on</p>
<p>board the boat--the steamer Mary Martin.  For some days Mr. Lincoln</p>
<p>had been at City Point, established on the steamer River Queen,</p>
<p>having come down from Washington to be nearer his generals, no doubt,</p>
<p>and also to be conveniently situated for the reception of tidings</p>
<p>from the front when operations began, for he could not endure the</p>
<p>delays in getting news to Washington.  This trip up the James had</p>
<p>been projected by General Meade, but on account of demands at the</p>
<p>front he could not go, so the President, General Grant, and I</p>
<p>composed the party.  We steamed up to where my cavalry was crossing</p>
<p>on the pontoon-bridge below the mouth of the Dutch Gap canal, and for</p>
<p>a little while watched the column as it was passing over the river,</p>
<p>the bright sunshine presaging good weather, but only to delude, as</p>
<p>was proved by the torrents of rain brought by the succeeding days of</p>
<p>March.  On the trip the President was not very cheerful.  In fact, he</p>
<p>was dejected, giving no indication of his usual means of diversion,</p>
<p>by which (his quaint stories) I had often heard he could find relief</p>
<p>from his cares.  He spoke to me of the impending operations and asked</p>
<p>many questions, laying stress upon the one, &quot;What would be the result</p>
<p>when the army moved out to the left, if the enemy should come down</p>
<p>and capture City Point?&quot; the question being prompted, doubtless, by</p>
<p>the bold assault on our lines and capture of Fort Steadman two days</p>
<p>before by General Gordon.  I answered that I did not think it at all</p>
<p>probable that General Lee would undertake such a desperate measure to</p>
<p>relieve the strait he was in; that General Hartranft&#x27;s successful</p>
<p>check to Gordon had ended, I thought, attacks of such a character;</p>
<p>and in any event General Grant would give Lee all he could attend to</p>
<p>on the left.  Mr. Lincoln said nothing about my proposed route of</p>
<p>march, and I doubt if he knew of my instructions, or was in</p>
<p>possession at most of more than a very general outline of the plan of</p>
<p>campaign.  It was late when the Mary Martin returned to City Point,</p>
<p>and I spent the night there with General Ingalls.</p>
<p>The morning of the 27th I went out to Hancock Station to look after</p>
<p>my troops and prepare for moving two days later.  In the afternoon I</p>
<p>received a telegram from General Grant, saying: &quot;General Sherman will</p>
<p>be here this evening to spend a few hours.  I should like to have you</p>
<p>come down.&quot;  Sherman&#x27;s coming was a surprise--at least to me it was--</p>
<p>this despatch being my first intimation of his expected arrival.</p>
<p>Well knowing the zeal and emphasis with which General Sherman would</p>
<p>present his views, there again came into my mind many misgivings with</p>
<p>reference to the movement of the cavalry, and I made haste to start</p>
<p>for Grant&#x27;s headquarters.  I got off a little after 7 o&#x27;clock, taking</p>
<p>the rickety military railroad, the rails of which were laid on the</p>
<p>natural surface of the ground, with grading only here and there at</p>
<p>points of absolute necessity, and had not gone far when the</p>
<p>locomotive jumped the track.  This delayed my arrival at City Point</p>
<p>till near midnight, but on repairing to the little cabin that</p>
<p>sheltered the general-in-chief, I found him and Sherman still up</p>
<p>talking over the problem whose solution was near at hand.  As already</p>
<p>stated, thoughts as to the tenor of my instructions became uppermost</p>
<p>the moment I received the telegram in the afternoon, and they</p>
<p>continued to engross and disturb me all the way down the railroad,</p>
<p>for I feared that the telegram foreshadowed, under the propositions</p>
<p>Sherman would present, a more specific compliance with the written</p>
<p>instructions than General Grant had orally assured me would be</p>
<p>exacted.</p>
<p>My entrance into the shanty suspended the conversation for a moment</p>
<p>only, and then General Sherman, without prelude, rehearsed his plans</p>
<p>for moving his army, pointing out with every detail how he would come</p>
<p>up through the Carolinas to join the troops besieging Petersburg and</p>
<p>Richmond, and intimating that my cavalry, after striking the</p>
<p>Southside and Danville railroads, could join him with ease.  I made</p>
<p>no comments on the projects for moving, his own troops, but as soon</p>
<p>as opportunity offered, dissented emphatically from the proposition</p>
<p>to have me join the Army of the Tennessee, repeating in substance</p>
<p>what I had previously expressed to General Grant.</p>
<p>My uneasiness made me somewhat too earnest, I fear, but General Grant</p>
<p>soon mollified me, and smoothed matters over by practically repeating</p>
<p>what he had told me in regard to this point at the close of our</p>
<p>interview the day before, so I pursued the subject no further.  In a</p>
<p>little while the conference ended, and I again sought lodging at the</p>
<p>hospitable quarters of Ingalls.</p>
<p>Very early the next morning, while I was still in bed, General</p>
<p>Sherman came to me and renewed the subject of my joining him, but</p>
<p>when he saw that I was unalterably opposed to it the conversation</p>
<p>turned into other channels, and after we had chatted awhile he</p>
<p>withdrew, and later in the day went up the river with the President,</p>
<p>General Grant, and Admiral Porter, I returning to my command at</p>
<p>Hancock Station, where my presence was needed to put my troops in</p>
<p>march next day.</p>
<p>During the entire winter General Grant&#x27;s lines fronting Petersburg</p>
<p>had extended south of the Appomattox River, practically from that</p>
<p>stream around to where the Vaughn road crosses Hatcher&#x27;s Run, and</p>
<p>this was nearly the situation Wilien the cavalry concentrated at</p>
<p>Hancock Station, General Weitzel holding the line north of the</p>
<p>Appomattox, fronting Richmond and Bermuda Hundred.</p>
<p>The instructions of the 24th of March contemplated that the campaign</p>
<p>should begin with the movement of Warren&#x27;s corps (the Fifth) at</p>
<p>3 o&#x27;clock on the morning of the 29th, and Humphreys&#x27;s (the Second) at</p>
<p>6; the rest of the infantry holding on in the trenches.  The cavalry</p>
<p>was to move in conjunction with Warren and Humphreys, and make its</p>
<p>way out beyond our left as these corps opened the road.</p>
<p>The night of the 28th I received the following additional</p>
<p>instructions, the general tenor of which again disturbed me, for</p>
<p>although I had been assured that I was not to join General Sherman,</p>
<p>it will be seen that the supplemental directions distinctly present</p>
<p>that alternative, and I therefore feared that during the trip up the</p>
<p>James River on the morning of the 28th General Grant had returned to</p>
<p>his original views:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>&quot;City Point, Va., March 28, 1865.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN:</p>
<p>&quot;The Fifth Army Corps will move by the Vaughn road at 3 A.M.</p>
<p>tomorrow morning.  The Second moves at about 9 A.M., having but about</p>
<p>three miles to march to reach the point designated for it to take on</p>
<p>the right of the Fifth Corps, after the latter reaches Dinwiddie</p>
<p>Court House.</p>
<p>&quot;Move your cavalry at as early an hour as you can, and without being</p>
<p>confined to any particular road or roads.  You may go out by the</p>
<p>nearest roads in rear of the Fifth Corps, pass by its left, and</p>
<p>passing near to or through Dinwiddie, reach the right and rear of the</p>
<p>enemy as soon as you can.  It is not the intention to attack the</p>
<p>enemy in his intrenched position, but to force him out if possible.</p>
<p>Should he come out and attack us, or get himself where he can be</p>
<p>attacked, move in with your entire force in your own way, and with</p>
<p>the full reliance that the army will engage or follow the enemy, as</p>
<p>circumstances will dictate.  I shall be on the field, and will</p>
<p>probably be able to communicate with you; should I not do so, and you</p>
<p>find that the enemy keeps within his main intrenched line, you may</p>
<p>cut loose and push for the Danville road.  If you find it practicable</p>
<p>I would like you to cross the Southside road, between Petersburg and</p>
<p>Burkeville, and destroy it to some extent.  I would not advise much</p>
<p>detention, however, until you reach the Danville road, which I would</p>
<p>like you to strike as near to the Appomattox as possible; make your</p>
<p>destruction of that road as complete as possible; you can then pass</p>
<p>on to the Southside road, west of Burkeville, and destroy that in</p>
<p>like manner.</p>
<p>&quot;After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads,</p>
<p>which are now the only avenues of supply to Lee&#x27;s army, you may</p>
<p>return to this army, selecting your road farther south, or you may go</p>
<p>on into North Carolina and join General Sherman.  Should you select</p>
<p>the latter course, get the information to me as early as possible, so</p>
<p>that I may send orders to meet you at Goldsboro&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.&quot;</p>
<p>These instructions did not alter my line of march for the morrow, and</p>
<p>I trusted matters would so come about as not to require compliance</p>
<p>with those portions relative to the railroads and to joining Sherman;</p>
<p>so early on the 29th I moved my cavalry out toward Ream&#x27;s Station on</p>
<p>the Weldon road, Devin commanding the First Division, with Colonels</p>
<p>Gibbs, Stagg, and Fitzhugh in charge of the brigades; the Third</p>
<p>Division under Custer, Colonels Wells, Capehart and Pennington being</p>
<p>the brigade commanders.  These two divisions united were commanded by</p>
<p>Merritt, as they had been since leaving Winchester.  Crook headed the</p>
<p>Second Division, his brigades being under General Davies and Colonels</p>
<p>John I. Gregg and Smith.</p>
<p>Our general direction was westward, over such routes as could be</p>
<p>found, provided they did not embarrass the march of the infantry.</p>
<p>The roads, from the winter&#x27;s frosts and rains, were in a frightful</p>
<p>state, and when it was sought to avoid a spot which the head of the</p>
<p>column had proved almost bottomless, the bogs and quicksands of the</p>
<p>adjoining fields demonstrated that to make a detour was to go from</p>
<p>bad to worse.  In the face of these discouragements we floundered on,</p>
<p>however, crossing on the way a series of small streams swollen to</p>
<p>their banks.  Crook and Devin reached the county-seat of Dinwiddie</p>
<p>about 5 o&#x27;clock in the evening, having encountered only a small</p>
<p>picket, that at once gave way to our advance.  Merritt left Custer at</p>
<p>Malon&#x27;s crossing of Rowanty Creek to care for the trains containing</p>
<p>our subsistence and the reserve ammunition, these being stuck in the</p>
<p>mire at, intervals all the way back to the Jerusalem plank-road; and</p>
<p>to make any headway at all with the trains, Custer&#x27;s men often had to</p>
<p>unload the wagons and lift them out of the boggy places.</p>
<p>Crook and Devin camped near Dinwiddie Court House in such manner as</p>
<p>to cover the Vaughn, Flatfoot, Boydton, and Five Forks roads; for, as</p>
<p>these all intersected at Dinwiddie, they offered a chance for the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s approach toward the rear of the Fifth Corps, as Warren</p>
<p>extended to the left across the Boydton road.  Any of these routes</p>
<p>leading to the south or west might also be the one on which, in</p>
<p>conformity with one part of my instructions, I was expected to get</p>
<p>out toward the Danville and Southside railroads, and the Five Forks</p>
<p>road would lead directly to General Lee&#x27;s right flank, in case</p>
<p>opportunity was found to comply with the other part.  The place was,</p>
<p>therefore, of great strategic value, and getting it without cost</p>
<p>repaid us for floundering through the mud.</p>
<p>Dinwiddie Court House, though a most important point in the campaign,</p>
<p>was far from attractive in feature, being made up of a half-dozen</p>
<p>unsightly houses, a ramshackle tavern propped up on two sides with</p>
<p>pine poles, and the weatherbeaten building that gave official name to</p>
<p>the cross-roads.  We had no tents--there were none in the command--so</p>
<p>I took possession of the tavern for shelter for myself and staff, and</p>
<p>just as we had finished looking over its primitive interior a rain</p>
<p>storm set in.</p>
<p>The wagon containing my mess equipment was back somewhere on the</p>
<p>road, hopelessly stuck in the mud, and hence we had nothing to eat</p>
<p>except some coffee which two young women living at the tavern kindly</p>
<p>made for us; a small quantity of the berry being furnished from the</p>
<p>haversacks of my escort.  By the time we got the coffee, rain was</p>
<p>falling in sheets, and the evening bade fair to be a most dismal one;</p>
<p>but songs and choruses set up by some of my staff--the two young</p>
<p>women playing accompaniments on a battered piano--relieved the</p>
<p>situation and enlivened us a little.  However, the dreary night</p>
<p>brought me one great comfort; for General Grant, who that day had</p>
<p>moved out to Gravelly Run, sent me instructions to abandon all idea</p>
<p>of the contemplated raid, and directed me to act in concert with the</p>
<p>infantry under his immediate command, to turn, if possible, the right</p>
<p>flank of Lee&#x27;s army.  The despatch made my mind easy with respect to</p>
<p>the objectionable feature of my original instructions, and of course</p>
<p>relieved me also from the anxiety growing out of the letter received</p>
<p>at Hancock Station the night of the 28th; so, notwithstanding the</p>
<p>suspicions excited by some of my staff concerning the Virginia</p>
<p>feather-bed that had been assigned me, I turned in at a late hour and</p>
<p>slept most soundly.</p>
<p>The night of the 29th the left of General Grant&#x27;s infantry--Warren&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps--rested on the Boydton road, not far from its intersection with</p>
<p>the Quaker road.  Humphreys&#x27;s corps was next to Warren; then came</p>
<p>Ord, next Wright, and then Parke, with his right resting on the</p>
<p>Appomattox.  The moving of Warren and Humphreys to the left during</p>
<p>the day was early discovered by General Lee.  He met it by extending</p>
<p>the right of his infantry on the White Oak road, while drawing in the</p>
<p>cavalry of W. H. F. Lee and Rosser along the south bank of Stony</p>
<p>Creek to cover a crossroads called Five Forks, to anticipate me</p>
<p>there; for assuming that my command was moving in conjunction with</p>
<p>the infantry, with the ultimate purpose of striking the Southside</p>
<p>railroad, Lee made no effort to hold Dinwiddie, which he might have</p>
<p>done with his cavalry, and in this he made a fatal mistake.  The</p>
<p>cavalry of Fitz. Lee was ordered at this same time from Sunderland</p>
<p>depot to Five Forks, and its chief placed in command of all the</p>
<p>mounted troops of General Lee&#x27;s army.</p>
<p>At daylight on ttie 3oth I proceeded to make dispositions under the</p>
<p>new conditions imposed by my modified instructions, and directed</p>
<p>Merritt to push Devin out as far as the White Oak road to make a</p>
<p>reconnoissance to Five Forks, Crook being instructed to send Davies&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade to support Devin.  Crook was to hold, with Gregg&#x27;s brigade,</p>
<p>the Stony Creek crossing of the Boydton plank road, retaining Smith&#x27;s</p>
<p>near Dinwiddie, for use in any direction required.  On the 29th W. H.</p>
<p>F. Lee conformed the march of his cavalry with that of ours, but my</p>
<p>holding Stony Creek in this way forced him to make a detour west of</p>
<p>Chamberlin&#x27;s Run, in order to get in communication with his friends</p>
<p>at Five Forks.</p>
<p>The rain that had been falling all night gave no sign of stopping,</p>
<p>but kept pouring down all day long, and the swamps and quicksands</p>
<p>mired the horses, whether they marched in the roads or across the</p>
<p>adjacent fields.  Undismayed, nevertheless, each column set out for</p>
<p>its appointed duty, but shortly after the troops began to move I</p>
<p>received from General Grant this despatch, which put a new phase on</p>
<p>matters:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>&quot;GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN :</p>
<p>&quot;The heavy rain of to-day will make it impossible for us to do much</p>
<p>until it dries up a little, or we get roads around our rear repaired.</p>
<p>You may, therefore, leave what cavalry you deem necessary to protect</p>
<p>the left, and hold such positions as you deem necessary for that</p>
<p>purpose, and send the remainder back to Humphrey&#x27;s Station where they</p>
<p>can get hay and grain.  Fifty wagons loaded with forage will be sent</p>
<p>to you in the morning.  Send an officer back to direct the wagons</p>
<p>back to where you want them.  Report to me the cavalry you will leave</p>
<p>back, and the position you will occupy.  Could not your cavalry go</p>
<p>back by the way of Stony Creek depot and destroy or capture the store</p>
<p>of supplies there?</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.&quot;</p>
<p>When I had read and pondered this, I determined to ride over to</p>
<p>General Grant&#x27;s headquarters on Gravelly Run, and get a clear idea of</p>
<p>what it was proposed to do, for it seemed to me that a suspension of</p>
<p>operations would be a serious mistake.  Mounting a powerful gray</p>
<p>pacing horse called Breckenridge (from its capture from one of</p>
<p>Breckenridge&#x27;s staff-officers at Missionary Ridge), and that I knew</p>
<p>would carry me through the mud, I set out accompanied by my Assistant</p>
<p>Adjutant-General, Colonel Frederick C.  Newhall, and an escort of</p>
<p>about ten or fifteen men.  At first we rode north up the Boydton</p>
<p>plank-road, and coming upon our infantry pickets from a direction</p>
<p>where the enemy was expected to appear, they began to fire upon us,</p>
<p>but seeing from our actions that we were friends, they ceased, and</p>
<p>permitted us to pass the outposts.  We then struggled on in a</p>
<p>northeasterly direction across-country, till we struck the Vaughn</p>
<p>road.  This carried us to army headquarters, which were established</p>
<p>south of Gravelly Run in an old cornfield.  I rode to within a few</p>
<p>yards of the front of General Grant&#x27;s tent, my horse plunging at</p>
<p>every step almost to his knees in the mud, and dismounted near a</p>
<p>camp-fire, apparently a general one, for all the staff-officers were</p>
<p>standing around it on boards and rails placed here and there to keep</p>
<p>them from sinking into the mire.</p>
<p>Going directly to General Grant&#x27;s tent, I found him and Rawlins</p>
<p>talking over the question of suspending operations till the weather</p>
<p>should improve.  No orders about the matter had been issued yet,</p>
<p>except the despatch to me, and Rawlins, being strongly opposed to the</p>
<p>proposition, was frankly expostulating with General Grant, who, after</p>
<p>greeting me, remarked, in his quiet way: &quot; Well, Rawlins, I think you</p>
<p>had better take command.&quot;  Seeing that there was a difference up</p>
<p>between Rawlins and his chief, I made the excuse of being wet and</p>
<p>cold, and went outside to the fire.  Here General Ingalls met me and</p>
<p>took me to his tent, where I was much more comfortable than when</p>
<p>standing outside, and where a few minutes later we were joined by</p>
<p>General Grant.  Ingalls then retired, and General Grant began talking</p>
<p>of our fearful plight, resulting from the rains and mud, and saying</p>
<p>that because of this it seemed necessary to suspend operations.  I at</p>
<p>once begged him not to do so, telling him that my cavalry was already</p>
<p>on the move in spite of the difficulties, and that although a</p>
<p>suspension of operations would not be fatal, yet it would give rise</p>
<p>to the very charge of disaster to which he had referred at City</p>
<p>Point, and, moreover, that we would surely be ridiculed, just as</p>
<p>General Burnside&#x27;s army was after the mud march of 1863.  His better</p>
<p>judgment was against suspending operations, but the proposition had</p>
<p>been suggested by all sorts of complaints as to the impossibility of</p>
<p>moving the trains and the like, so it needed little argument to</p>
<p>convince him, and without further discussion he said, in that manner</p>
<p>which with him meant a firmness of purpose that could not be changed</p>
<p>by further complainings, &quot;We will go on.&quot;  I then told him that I</p>
<p>believed I could break in the enemy&#x27;s right if he would let me have</p>
<p>the Sixth Corps; but saying that the condition of the roads would</p>
<p>prevent the movement of infantry, he replied that I would have to</p>
<p>seize Five Forks with the cavalry alone.</p>
<p>On my way back to Dinwiddie I stopped at the headquarters of General</p>
<p>Warren, but the General being asleep, I went to the tent of one of</p>
<p>his staff-officers.  Colonel William T. Gentry, an old personal</p>
<p>friend with whom I had served in Oregon.  In a few minutes Warren</p>
<p>came in and we had a short conversation, he speaking rather</p>
<p>despondently of the outlook, being influenced no doubt by the</p>
<p>depressing weather.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Warren&#x27;s headquarters I returned, by the Boydton road to</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dinwiddie Court House, fording Gravelly Run with ease.  When I got as</p>
<p>far as the Dabney road I sent Colonel Newhall out on it toward Five</p>
<p>Forks, with orders for Merritt to develop the enemy&#x27;s position and</p>
<p>strength, and then rode on to Dinwiddie to endeavor to get all my</p>
<p>other troops up.  Merritt was halted at the intersection of the Five</p>
<p>Forks and Gravelly Church roads when Newhall delivered the orders,</p>
<p>and in compliance moving out Gibbs&#x27;s brigade promptly, sharp</p>
<p>skirmishing was brought on, Gibbs driving the Confederates to Five</p>
<p>Forks, where he found them behind a line of breastworks running along</p>
<p>the White Oak road.  The reconnoissance demonstrating the intention</p>
<p>of the enemy to hold this point, Gibbs was withdrawn.</p>
<p>That evening, at 7 o&#x27;clock, I reported the position of the</p>
<p>Confederate cavalry, and stated that it had been reinforced by</p>
<p>Pickett&#x27;s division of infantry.  On receipt of this despatch, General</p>
<p>Grant offered me the Fifth Corps, but I declined to take it, and</p>
<p>again asked for the Sixth, saying that with it I believed I could</p>
<p>turn the enemy (Pickett&#x27;s) left, or break through his lines.  The</p>
<p>morning of the 31st General Grant replied the the Sixth Corps could</p>
<p>not be taken from its position in the line, and offered me the</p>
<p>Second; but in the mean time circumstances had changed, and no corps</p>
<p>was ordered.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<p>BATTLE OF DINWIDDIE COURT HOUSE--PICKETT REPULSED--REINFORCED BY THE</p>
<p>FIFTH CORPS--BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS--TURNING THE CONFEDERATE LEFT--AN</p>
<p>UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS--RELIEVING GENERAL WARREN--THE WARREN COURT OF</p>
<p>INQUIRY--GENERAL SHERMAN&#x27;S OPINION.</p>
<p>The night of March 30 Merritt, with Devin&#x27;s division and Davies&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade, was camped on the Five Forks road about two miles in front</p>
<p>of Dinwiddie, near J. Boisseau&#x27;s.  Crook, with Smith and Gregg&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigades, continued to cover Stony Creek, and Custer was still back</p>
<p>at Rowanty Creek, trying to get the trains up.  This force had been</p>
<p>counted while crossing the creek on the 29th, the three divisions</p>
<p>numbering 9,000 enlisted men, Crook having 3,300, and Custer and</p>
<p>Devin 5,700.</p>
<p>During the 30th, the enemy had been concentrating his cavalry, and by</p>
<p>evening General W. H. F. Lee and General Rosser had joined Fitzhugh</p>
<p>Lee near Five Forks.  To this force was added, about dark, five</p>
<p>brigades of infantry--three from Pickett&#x27;s division, and two from</p>
<p>Johnson&#x27;s--all under command of Pickett.  The infantry came by the</p>
<p>White Oak road from the right of General Lee&#x27;s intrenchments, and</p>
<p>their arrival became positively known to me about dark, the</p>
<p>confirmatory intelligence being brought in then by some of Young&#x27;s</p>
<p>scouts who had been inside the Confederate lines.</p>
<p>On the 31st, the rain having ceased, directions were given at an</p>
<p>early hour to both Merritt and Crook to make reconnoissances</p>
<p>preparatory to securing Five Forks, and about 9 o&#x27;clock Merritt</p>
<p>started for the crossroads, Davies&#x27;s brigade supporting him.  His</p>
<p>march was necessarily slow because of the mud, and the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>pickets resisted with obstinacy also, but the coveted crossroads fell</p>
<p>to Merritt without much trouble, as the bulk of the enemy was just</p>
<p>then bent on other things.  At the same hour that Merritt started,</p>
<p>Crook moved Smith&#x27;s brigade out northwest from Dinwiddie to</p>
<p>Fitzgerald&#x27;s crossing of Chamberlain&#x27;s Creek, to cover Merritt&#x27;s</p>
<p>left, supporting Smith by placing Gregg to his right and rear.  The</p>
<p>occupation of this ford was timely, for Pickett, now in command of</p>
<p>both the cavalry and infantry, was already marching to get in</p>
<p>Merritt&#x27;s rear by crossing Chamberlain&#x27;s Creek.</p>
<p>To hold on to Fitzgerald&#x27;s ford Smith had to make a sharp fight, but</p>
<p>Mumford&#x27;s cavalry attacking Devin, the enemy&#x27;s infantry succeeded in</p>
<p>getting over Chamberlain&#x27;s Creek at a point higher up than</p>
<p>Fitzgerald&#x27;s ford, and assailing Davies, forced him back in a</p>
<p>northeasterly direction toward the Dinwiddie and Five Forks road in</p>
<p>company with Devin.  The retreat of Davies permitted Pickett to pass</p>
<p>between Crook and Merritt, which he promptly did, effectually</p>
<p>separating them and cutting off both Davies and Devin from the road</p>
<p>to Dinwiddie, so that to get to that point they had to retreat across</p>
<p>the country to B. Boisseau&#x27;s and then down the Boydton road.</p>
<p>Gibbs&#x27;s brigade had been in reserve near the intersection of the Five</p>
<p>Forks and Dabney roads, and directing Merritt to hold on there, I</p>
<p>ordered Gregg&#x27;s brigade to be mounted and brought to Merritt&#x27;s aid,</p>
<p>for if Pickett continued in pursuit north of the Five Forks road he</p>
<p>would expose his right and rear, and I determined to attack him, in</p>
<p>such case, from Gibbs&#x27;s position.  Gregg arrived in good season, and</p>
<p>as soon as his men were dismounted on Gibbs&#x27;s left, Merritt assailed</p>
<p>fiercely, compelling Pickett to halt and face a new foe, thus</p>
<p>interrupting an advance that would finally have carried Pickett into</p>
<p>the rear of Warren&#x27;s corps.</p>
<p>It was now about 4 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon and we were in a critical</p>
<p>situation, but having ordered Merritt to bring Devin and Davies to</p>
<p>Dinwiddie by the Boydton road, staff-officers were sent to hurry</p>
<p>Custer to the same point, for with its several diverging roads the</p>
<p>Court House was of vital importance, and I determined to stay there</p>
<p>at all hazards.  At the same time orders were sent to Smith&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade, which, by the advance of Pickett past its right flank and</p>
<p>the pressure of W. H. F. Lee on its front, had been compelled to give</p>
<p>up Fitzgerald&#x27;s crossing, to fall back toward Dinwiddie but to</p>
<p>contest every inch of ground so as to gain time.</p>
<p>When halted by the attack of Gregg and Gibbs, Pickett, desisting from</p>
<p>his pursuit of Devin, as already stated, turned his undivided</p>
<p>attention to this unexpected force, and with his preponderating</p>
<p>infantry pressed it back on the Five Forks road toward Dinwiddle,</p>
<p>though our men, fighting dismounted behind barricades at different</p>
<p>points, displayed such obstinacy as to make Pickett&#x27;s progress slow,</p>
<p>and thus give me time to look out a line for defending the Court</p>
<p>House.  I selected a place about three-fourths of a mile northwest of</p>
<p>the crossroads, and Custer coming up quickly with Capehart&#x27;s brigade,</p>
<p>took position on the left of the road to Five Forks in some open</p>
<p>ground along the crest of a gentle ridge.  Custer got Capehart into</p>
<p>place just in time to lend a hand to Smith, who, severely pressed,</p>
<p>came back on us here from his retreat along Chamberlain&#x27;s &quot;bed&quot;--the</p>
<p>vernacular for a woody swamp such as that through which Smith</p>
<p>retired.  A little later the brigades of Gregg and Gibbs, falling to</p>
<p>the rear slowly and steadily, took up in the woods a line which</p>
<p>covered the Boydton Road some distance to the right of Capehart, the</p>
<p>intervening gap to be filled with Pennington&#x27;s brigade.  By this time</p>
<p>our horse-artillery, which for two days had been stuck in the mud,</p>
<p>was all up, and every gun was posted in this line.</p>
<p>It was now near sunset, and the enemy&#x27;s cavalry thinking the day was</p>
<p>theirs, made a dash at Smith, but just as the assailants appeared in</p>
<p>the open fields, Capehart&#x27;s men opened so suddenly on their left</p>
<p>flank as to cause it to recoil in astonishment, which permitted Smith</p>
<p>to connect his brigade with Custer unmolested.  We were now in good</p>
<p>shape behind the familiar barricades, and having a continuous line,</p>
<p>excepting only the gap to be filled with Pennington, that covered</p>
<p>Dinwiddie and the Boydton Road.  My left rested in the woods about</p>
<p>half a mile west of the Court House, and the barricades extended from</p>
<p>this flank in a semicircle through the open fields in a northeasterly</p>
<p>direction, to a piece-of thick timber on the right, near the Boydton</p>
<p>Road.</p>
<p>A little before the sun went down the Confederate infantry was formed</p>
<p>for the attack, and, fortunately for us, Pennington&#x27;s brigade came up</p>
<p>and filled the space to which it was assigned between Capehart and</p>
<p>Gibbs, just as Pickett moved out across the cleared fields in front</p>
<p>of Custer, in deep lines that plainly told how greatly we were</p>
<p>outnumbered.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Generals Merritt and Custer and my staff, I now rode</p>
<p>along the barricades to encourage the men.  Our enthusiastic</p>
<p>reception showed that they were determined to stay.  The cavalcade</p>
<p>drew the enemy&#x27;s fire, which emptied several of the saddles--among</p>
<p>others Mr. Theodore Wilson, correspondent of the New York Herald,</p>
<p>being wounded.  In reply our horse-artillery opened on the advancing</p>
<p>Confederates, but the men behind the barricades lay still till</p>
<p>Pickett&#x27;s troops were within short range.  Then they opened, Custer&#x27;s</p>
<p>repeating rifles pouring out such a shower of lead that nothing could</p>
<p>stand up against it.  The repulse was very quick, and as the gray</p>
<p>lines retired to the woods from which but a few minutes before they</p>
<p>had so confidently advanced, all danger of their taking Dinwiddie or</p>
<p>marching to the left and rear of our infantry line was over, at least</p>
<p>for the night.  The enemy being thus checked, I sent a staff-officer-</p>
<p>-Captain Sheridan--to General Grant to report what had taken place</p>
<p>during the afternoon, and to say that I proposed to stay at</p>
<p>Dinwiddie, but if ultimately compelled to abandon the place, I would</p>
<p>do so by retiring on the Vaughn road toward Hatcher&#x27;s Run, for I then</p>
<p>thought the attack might be renewed next morning.  Devin and Davies</p>
<p>joined me about dark, and my troops being now well in hand, I sent a</p>
<p>second staff-officer--Colonel John Kellogg--to explain my situation</p>
<p>more fully, and to assure General Grant that I would hold on at</p>
<p>Dinwiddie till forced to let go.</p>
<p>By following me to Dinwiddie the enemy&#x27;s infantry had completely</p>
<p>isolated itself, and hence there was now offered the Union troops a</p>
<p>rare opportunity.  Lee was outside of his works, just as we desired,</p>
<p>and the general-in-chief realized this the moment he received the</p>
<p>first report of my situation; General Meade appreciated it too from</p>
<p>the information he got from Captain Sheridan, en route to army</p>
<p>headquarters with the first tidings, and sent this telegram to</p>
<p>General Grant :</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,</p>
<p>&quot;March 31, 1865.  9:45 p.m.</p>
<p>&quot;LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:</p>
<p>&quot;Would it not be well for Warren to go down with his whole corps and</p>
<p>smash up the force in front of Sheridan?  Humphreys can hold the line</p>
<p>to the Boydton plank-road, and the refusal along with it.  Bartlett&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade is now on the road from G. Boisseau&#x27;s, running north, where</p>
<p>it crosses Gravelly Run, he having gone down the White Oak road.</p>
<p>Warren could go at once that way, and take the force threatening</p>
<p>Sheridan in rear at Dinwiddie, and move on the enemy&#x27;s rear with the</p>
<p>other two.</p>
<p>&quot;G. G. MEADE, Major-General.&quot;</p>
<p>An hour later General Grant replied in these words:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>&quot;DABNEY&#x27;S MILLS, March 311, 1865.  10:15 P. M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Army of the Potomac.</p>
<p>Let Warren move in the way you propose, and urge him not to stop for</p>
<p>anything.  Let Griffin (Griffin had been ordered by Warren to the</p>
<p>Boydton road to protect his rear) go on as he was first directed.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>These two despatches were the initiatory steps in sending the Fifth</p>
<p>Corps, under Major-General G. K. Warren, to report to me, and when I</p>
<p>received word of its coming and also that Genera Mackenzie&#x27;s cavalry</p>
<p>from the Army of the James was likewise to be added to my command,</p>
<p>and that discretionary authority was given me to use all my forces</p>
<p>against Pickett, I resolved to destroy him, if it was within the</p>
<p>bounds of possibility, before he could rejoin Lee.</p>
<p>In a despatch, dated 10:05 p.m., telling me of the coming of Warren</p>
<p>and Mackenzie, General Grant also said that the Fifth Corps should</p>
<p>reach me by 12 o&#x27;clock that night, but at that hour not only had none</p>
<p>of the corps arrived, but no report from it, so believing that if it</p>
<p>came all the way down to Dinwiddie the next morning, our opportunity</p>
<p>would be gone, I concluded that it would be best to order Warren to</p>
<p>move in on the enemy&#x27;s rear while the cavalry attacked in front, and,</p>
<p>therefore, at 3 o&#x27;clock in the morning of April 1 sent this despatch</p>
<p>to General Warren:</p>
<p>&quot;CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS, DINWIDDIE C. H.,</p>
<p>&quot;April 1, 1865--3. A.M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL WARREN,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Fifth Army Corps.</p>
<p>I am holding in front of Dinwiddie Court House, on the road leading</p>
<p>to Five Forks, for three-quarters of a mile with General Custer&#x27;s</p>
<p>division.  The enemy are in his immediate front, lying so as to cover</p>
<p>the road just this side of A. Adams&#x27;s house, which leads across</p>
<p>Chamberlain&#x27;s bed, or run.  I understand you have a division at J.[G]</p>
<p>Boisseau&#x27;s; if so, you are in rear of the enemy&#x27;s line and almost on</p>
<p>his flank.  I will hold on here.  Possibly they may attack Custer at</p>
<p>daylight; if so, attack instantly and in full force.  Attack at</p>
<p>daylight anyhow, and I will make an effort to get the road this side</p>
<p>of Adams&#x27;s house, and if I do, you can capture the whole of them.</p>
<p>Any force moving down the road I am holding, or on the White Oak</p>
<p>road, will be in the enemy&#x27;s rear, and in all probability get any</p>
<p>force that may escape you by a flank movement.  Do not fear my</p>
<p>leaving here.  If the enemy remains, I shall fight at daylight.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.</p>
<p>With daylight came a slight fog, but it lifted almost immediately,</p>
<p>and Merritt moved Custer and Devin forward.  As these divisions</p>
<p>advanced the enemy&#x27;s infantry fell back on the Five Forks road, Devin</p>
<p>pressing him along the road, while Custer extended on the left over</p>
<p>toward Chamberlain&#x27;s Run, Crook being held in watch along Stony</p>
<p>Creek, meanwhile, to be utilized as circumstances might require when</p>
<p>Warren attacked.</p>
<p>The order of General Meade to Warren the night of March 31--a copy</p>
<p>being sent me also--was positive in its directions, but as midnight</p>
<p>came without a sign of or word from the Fifth Corps, notwithstanding</p>
<p>that was the hour fixed for its arrival, I nevertheless assumed that</p>
<p>there were good reasons for its non-appearance, but never once</p>
<p>doubted that measures would be taken to comply with my despatch Of</p>
<p>3 A. M. and therefore hoped that, as Pickett was falling back slowly</p>
<p>toward Five Forks, Griffin&#x27;s and Crawford&#x27;s divisions would come in</p>
<p>on the Confederate left and rear by the Crump road near J.[G]</p>
<p>Boisseau&#x27;s house.</p>
<p>But they did not reach there till after the enemy had got by.  As a</p>
<p>matter of fact, when Pickett was passing the all-important point</p>
<p>Warren&#x27;s men were just breaking from the bivouac in which their chief</p>
<p>had placed them the night before, and the head of Griffin&#x27;s division</p>
<p>did not get to Boisseau&#x27;s till after my cavalry, which meanwhile had</p>
<p>been joined by Ayres&#x27;s division of the Fifth Corps by way of the</p>
<p>Boydton and Dabney roads.  By reason of the delay in moving Griffin</p>
<p>and Crawford, the enemy having escaped, I massed the Fifth Corps at</p>
<p>J.[G] Boisseau&#x27;s so that the men could be rested, and directed it to</p>
<p>remain there; General Warren himself had not then come up.  General</p>
<p>Mackenzie, who had reported just after daybreak, was ordered at first</p>
<p>to stay at Dinwiddie Court House, but later was brought along the</p>
<p>Five Forks road to Dr. Smith&#x27;s, and Crook&#x27;s division was directed to</p>
<p>continue watching the crossings of Stony Creek and Chamberlain&#x27;s Run.</p>
<p>That we had accomplished nothing but to oblige our foe to retreat was</p>
<p>to me bitterly disappointing, but still feeling sure that he would</p>
<p>not give up the Five Forks crossroads without a fight, I pressed him</p>
<p>back there with Merritt&#x27;s cavalry, Custer advancing on the Scott</p>
<p>road, while Devin drove the rearguard along that leading from J.[G]</p>
<p>Boisseau&#x27;s to Five Forks.</p>
<p>By 2 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon Merritt had forced the enemy inside his</p>
<p>intrenchments, which began with a short return about three-quarters</p>
<p>of a mile east of the Forks and ran along the south side of the White</p>
<p>Oak road to a point about a mile west of the Forks.  From the left of</p>
<p>the return over toward Hatcher&#x27;s Run was posted Mumford&#x27;s cavalry,</p>
<p>dismounted.  In the return itself was Wallace&#x27;s brigade, and next on</p>
<p>its right came Ransom&#x27;s, then Stewart&#x27;s, then Terry&#x27;s, then Corse&#x27;s.</p>
<p>On the right of Corse was W. H. F. Lee&#x27;s division of cavalry.  Ten</p>
<p>pieces of artillery also were in this line, three on the right of the</p>
<p>works, three near the centre at the crossroads, and four on the left,</p>
<p>in the return.  Rosser&#x27;s cavalry was guarding the Confederate trains</p>
<p>north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run beyond the crossing of the Ford road.</p>
<p>I felt certain the enemy would fight at Five Forks--he had to--so,</p>
<p>while we were getting up to his intrenchments, I decided on my plan</p>
<p>of battle.  This was to attack his whole front with Merritt&#x27;s two</p>
<p>cavalry divisions, make a feint of turning his right flank, and with</p>
<p>the Fifth Corps assail his left.  As the Fifth Corps moved into</p>
<p>action, its right flank was to be covered by Mackenzie&#x27;s cavalry,</p>
<p>thus entirely cutting off Pickett&#x27;s troops from communication with</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s right flank, which rested near the Butler house at the junction</p>
<p>of the Claiborne and White Oaks roads.  In execution of this plan,</p>
<p>Merritt worked his men close in toward the intrenchments, and while</p>
<p>he was thus engaged, I ordered Warren to bring up the Fifth Corps,</p>
<p>sending the order by my engineer officer, Captain Gillespie, who had</p>
<p>reconnoitred the ground in the neighborhood of Gravelly Run Church,</p>
<p>where the infantry was to form for attack.</p>
<p>Gillespie delivered the order about 1 o&#x27;clock, and when the corps was</p>
<p>put in motion, General Warren joined me at the front.  Before he</p>
<p>came, I had received, through Colonel Babcock, authority from General</p>
<p>Grant to relieve him, but I did not wish to do it, particularly on</p>
<p>the eve of battle; so, saying nothing at all about the message</p>
<p>brought me, I entered at once on the plan for defeating Pickett,</p>
<p>telling Warren how the enemy was posted, explaining with considerable</p>
<p>detail, and concluding by stating that I wished his troops to be</p>
<p>formed on the Gravelly Church road, near its junction with the White</p>
<p>Oak road, with two divisions to the front, aligned obliquely to the</p>
<p>White Oak road, and one in reserve, opposite the centre of these two.</p>
<p>General Warren seemed to understand me clearly, and then left to join</p>
<p>his command, while I turned my attention to the cavalry, instructing</p>
<p>Merritt to begin by making demonstrations as though to turn the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s right, and to assault the front of the works with his</p>
<p>dismounted cavalry as soon as Warren became engaged.  Afterward I</p>
<p>rode around to Gravelly Run Church, and found the head of Warren&#x27;s</p>
<p>column just appearing, while he was sitting under a tree making a</p>
<p>rough sketch of the ground.  I was disappointed that more of the</p>
<p>corps was not already up, and as the precious minutes went by without</p>
<p>any apparent effort to hurry the troops on to the field, this</p>
<p>disappointment grew into disgust.  At last I expressed to Warren my</p>
<p>fears that the cavalry might expend all their ammunition before the</p>
<p>attack could be made, that the sun would go down before the battle</p>
<p>could be begun, or that troops from Lee&#x27;s right, which, be it</p>
<p>remembered, was less than three miles away from my right, might, by</p>
<p>striking my rear, or even by threatening it, prevent the attack on</p>
<p>Pickett.</p>
<p>Warren did not seem to me to be at all solicitous; his manner</p>
<p>exhibited decided apathy, and he remarked with indifference that</p>
<p>&quot;Bobby Lee was always getting people into trouble.&quot;  With unconcern</p>
<p>such as this, it is no wonder that fully three hours&#x27; time was</p>
<p>consumed in marching his corps from J.[G]  Boisseau&#x27;s to Gravelly Run</p>
<p>Church, though the distance was but two miles.  However, when my</p>
<p>patience was almost worn out, Warren reported his troops ready,</p>
<p>Ayres&#x27;s division being formed on the west side of the Gravelly Church</p>
<p>road, Crawford&#x27;s on the east side, and Griffin in reserve behind the</p>
<p>right of Crawford, a little different from my instructions.  The</p>
<p>corps had no artillery present, its batteries, on account of the mud,</p>
<p>being still north of Gravelly Run.  Meanwhile Merritt had been busy</p>
<p>working his men close up to the intrenchments from the angle of the</p>
<p>return west, along the White Oak road.</p>
<p>About 4 o&#x27;clock Warren began the attack.  He was to assault the left</p>
<p>flank of the Confederate infantry at a point where I knew Pickett&#x27;s</p>
<p>intrenchments were refused, almost at right angles with the White Oak</p>
<p>road.  I did not know exactly how far toward Hatcher&#x27;s Run this part</p>
<p>of the works extended, for here the videttes of Mumford&#x27;s cavalry</p>
<p>were covering, but I did know where the refusal began.  This return,</p>
<p>then, was the point I wished to assail, believing that if the assault</p>
<p>was made with spirit, the line could be turned.  I therefore intended</p>
<p>that Ayres and Crawford should attack the refused trenches squarely,</p>
<p>and when these two divisions and Merritt&#x27;s cavalry became hotly</p>
<p>engaged, Griffin&#x27;s division was to pass around the left of the</p>
<p>Confederate line; and I personally instructed Griffin how I wished</p>
<p>him to go in, telling him also that as he advanced, his right flank</p>
<p>would be taken care of by Mackenzie,who was to be pushed over toward</p>
<p>the Ford road and Hatcher&#x27;s Run.</p>
<p>The front of the corps was oblique to the White Oak road; and on</p>
<p>getting there, it was to swing round to the left till perpendicular</p>
<p>to the road, keeping closed to the left.  Ayres did his part well,</p>
<p>and to the letter, bringing his division square up to the front of</p>
<p>the return near the angle; but Crawford did not wheel to the left, as</p>
<p>was intended.  On the contrary, on receiving fire from Mumford&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry, Crawford swerved to the right and moved north from the</p>
<p>return, thus isolating his division from Ayres; and Griffin,</p>
<p>uncertain of the enemy&#x27;s position, naturally followed Crawford.</p>
<p>The deflection of this division on a line of march which finally</p>
<p>brought it out on the Ford road near C. Young&#x27;s house, frustrated the</p>
<p>purpose I had in mind when ordering the attack, and caused a gap</p>
<p>between Ayres and Crawford, of which the enemy quickly took</p>
<p>advantage, and succeeded in throwing a part of Ayres&#x27;s division into</p>
<p>confusion.  At this juncture I sent word to General Warren to have</p>
<p>Crawford recalled; for the direction he was following was not only a</p>
<p>mistaken one, but, in case the assault at the return failed, he ran</p>
<p>great risk of capture.  Warren could not be found, so I then sent for</p>
<p>Griffin--first by Colonel Newhall, and then by Colonel Sherman--to</p>
<p>come to the aid of Ayres, who was now contending alone with that part</p>
<p>of the enemy&#x27;s infantry at the return.  By this time Griffin had</p>
<p>observed and appreciated Crawford&#x27;s mistake, however, and when the</p>
<p>staff-officers reached him, was already faced to the left; so,</p>
<p>marching across Crawford&#x27;s rear, he quickly joined Ayres, who</p>
<p>meanwhile had rallied his troops and carried the return.</p>
<p>When Ayres&#x27;s division went over the flank of the enemy&#x27;s works,</p>
<p>Devin&#x27;s division of cavalry, which had been assaulting the front,</p>
<p>went over in company with it; and hardly halting to reform, the</p>
<p>intermingling infantry and dismounted cavalry swept down inside the</p>
<p>intrenchments, pushing to and beyond Five Forks, capturing thousands</p>
<p>of prisoners.  The only stand the enemy tried to make was when he</p>
<p>attempted to form near the Ford road.  Griffin pressed him so hard</p>
<p>there, however, that he had to give way in short order, and many of</p>
<p>his men, with three pieces of artillery, fell into the hands of</p>
<p>Crawford while on his circuitous march.</p>
<p>The right of Custer&#x27;s division gained a foothold on the enemy&#x27;s works</p>
<p>simultaneously with Devin&#x27;s, but on the extreme left Custer had a</p>
<p>very severe combat with W. H. F. Lee&#x27;s cavalry, as well as with</p>
<p>Corse&#x27;s and Terry&#x27;s infantry.  Attacking Terry and Corse with</p>
<p>Pennington&#x27;s brigade dismounted, he assailed Lee&#x27;s cavalry with his</p>
<p>other two brigades mounted, but Lee held on so obstinately that</p>
<p>Custer gained but little ground till our troops, advancing behind the</p>
<p>works, drove Corse and Terry out.  Then Lee made no further stand</p>
<p>except at the west side of the Gillian field, where, assisted by</p>
<p>Corse&#x27;s brigade, he endeavored to cover the retreat, but just before</p>
<p>dark Custer, in concert with some Fifth Corps regiments under Colonel</p>
<p>Richardson, drove ihe last of the enemy westward on the White Oak</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>Our success was unqualified; we had overthrown Pickett, taken six</p>
<p>guns, thirteen battle-flags, and nearly six thousand prisoners.  When</p>
<p>the battle was practically over, I turned to consider my position</p>
<p>with reference to the main Confederate army.  My troops, though</p>
<p>victorious, were isolated from the Army of the Potomac, for on the</p>
<p>31st of March the extreme left of that army had been thrown back</p>
<p>nearly to the Boydton plank-road, and hence there was nothing to</p>
<p>prevent the enemy&#x27;s issuing from his trenches at the intersection of</p>
<p>the White Oak and Claiborne roads and marching directly on my rear.</p>
<p>I surmised that he might do this that night or early next morning.</p>
<p>It was therefore necessary to protect myself in this critical</p>
<p>situation, and General Warren having sorely disappointed me, both in</p>
<p>the moving of his corps and in its management during the battle, I</p>
<p>felt that he was not the man to rely upon under such circumstances,</p>
<p>and deeming that it was to the best interest of the service as well</p>
<p>as but just to myself, I relieved him, ordering him to report to</p>
<p>General Grant.</p>
<p>I then put Griffin in command of the Fifth Corps, and directed him to</p>
<p>withdraw from the pursuit as quickly as he could after following the</p>
<p>enemy a short distance, and form in line of battle near Gravelly Run</p>
<p>Church, at right angles with the White Oak road, with Ayres and</p>
<p>Crawford facing toward the enemy at the junction of the White Oak and</p>
<p>Claiborne roads, leaving Bartlett, now commanding Griffin&#x27;s division,</p>
<p>near the Ford road.  Mackenzie also was left on the Ford road at the</p>
<p>crossing of Hatcher&#x27;s Run, Merritt going into camp on the Widow</p>
<p>Gillian&#x27;s plantation.  As I had been obliged to keep Crook&#x27;s division</p>
<p>along Stony Creek throughout the day, it had taken no active part in</p>
<p>the battle.</p>
<p>Years after the war, in 1879, a Court of Inquiry was given General</p>
<p>Warren in relation to his conduct on the day of the battle.  He</p>
<p>assumed that the delay in not granting his request for an inquiry,</p>
<p>which was first made at the close of the war, was due to opposition</p>
<p>on my part.  In this he was in error; I never opposed the ordering of</p>
<p>the Court, but when it was finally decided to convene it I naturally</p>
<p>asked to be represented by counsel, for the authorization of the</p>
<p>Inquiry was so peculiarly phrased that it made me practically a</p>
<p>respondent.</p>
<p>&quot;NEW YORK CITY, May 3, 1880</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL W. S. HANCOCK, U. S. A.</p>
<p>&quot;President Court of Inquiry, Governor&#x27;s Island.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir: Since my arrival in this city, under a subpoena to appear and</p>
<p>testify before the Court of which you are president, I have been</p>
<p>indirectly and unofficially informed that the Court some time ago</p>
<p>forwarded an invitation to me (which has not been received) to appear</p>
<p>personally or by counsel, in order to aid it in obtaining a knowledge</p>
<p>as to the facts concerning the movements terminating in the battle of</p>
<p>&#x27;Five Forks,&#x27; with reference to the direct subjects of its inquiry.</p>
<p>Any invitation of this character I should always and do consider it</p>
<p>incumbent on me to accede to, and do everything in my power in</p>
<p>furtherance of the specific purposes for which courts of inquiry are</p>
<p>by law instituted.</p>
<p>&quot;The order convening the Court (a copy of which was not received by</p>
<p>me at my division headquarters until two days after the time</p>
<p>appointed for the Court to assemble) contemplates an inquiry based on</p>
<p>the application of Lieutenant Colonel G. K. Warren, Corps of</p>
<p>Engineers, as to his conduct while major-general commanding the Fifth</p>
<p>Army Corps, under my command, in reference to accusations or</p>
<p>imputations assumed in the order to have been made against him, and I</p>
<p>understand through the daily press that my official report of the</p>
<p>battle of Five Forks has been submitted by him as a basis of inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;If it is proposed to inquire, either directly or indirectly, as to</p>
<p>any action of mine so far as the commanding general Fifth Army Corps</p>
<p>was concerned, or my motives for such action, I desire to be</p>
<p>specifically informed wherein such action or transaction is alleged</p>
<p>to contain an accusation or imputation to become a subject of</p>
<p>inquiry, so that, knowing what issues are raised, I may intelligently</p>
<p>aid the Court in arriving at the facts.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a long time since the battle of Five Forks was fought, and</p>
<p>during the time that has elapsed the official reports of that battle</p>
<p>have been received and acknowledged by the Government; but now, when</p>
<p>the memory of events has in many instances grown dim, and three of</p>
<p>the principal actors on that field are dead--Generals Griffin,</p>
<p>Custer, and Devin, whose testimony would have been valuable--an</p>
<p>investigation is ordered which might perhaps do injustice unless the</p>
<p>facts pertinent to the issues are fully developed.</p>
<p>&quot;My duties are such that it will not be convenient for me to be</p>
<p>present continuously during the sessions of the Court.  In order,</p>
<p>however, that everything may be laid before it in my power pertinent</p>
<p>to such specific issues as aie legally raised, I beg leave to</p>
<p>introduce Major Asa Bird Gardner as my counsel.</p>
<p>&quot;Very respectfully,</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN, Lieut.-General.&quot;</p>
<p>Briefly stated, in my report of the battle of Five Forks there were</p>
<p>four imputations concerning General Warren.  The first implied that</p>
<p>Warren failed to reach me on the 1st of April, when I had reason to</p>
<p>expect him; the second, that the tactical handling of his corps was</p>
<p>unskillful; the third, that he did not exert himself to get his corps</p>
<p>up to Gravelly Run Church; and the fourth, that when portions of his</p>
<p>line gave way he did not exert himself to restore confidence to his</p>
<p>troops.  The Court found against him on the first and second counts,</p>
<p>and for him on the third and fourth.  This finding was unsatisfactory</p>
<p>to General Warren, for he hoped to obtain such an unequivocal</p>
<p>recognition of his services as to cast discredit on my motives for</p>
<p>relieving him.  These were prompted by the conditions alone--by the</p>
<p>conduct of General Warren as described, and my consequent lack of</p>
<p>confidence in him.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that in my conversation with General Grant on</p>
<p>the 30th, relative to the suspension of operations because of the</p>
<p>mud, I asked him to let me have the Sixth Corps to help me in</p>
<p>breaking in on the enemy&#x27;s right, but that it could not be sent me;</p>
<p>it will be recalled also that the Fifth Corps was afterward tendered</p>
<p>and declined.  From these facts it has been alleged that I was</p>
<p>prejudiced against General Warren, but this is not true.  As we had</p>
<p>never been thrown much together I knew but little of him.  I had no</p>
<p>personal objection to him, and certainly could have none to his</p>
<p>corps.  I was expected to do an extremely dangerous piece of work,</p>
<p>and knowing the Sixth Corps well--my cavalry having campaigned with</p>
<p>it so successfully in the Shenandoah Valley, I naturally preferred</p>
<p>it, and declined the Fifth for no other reason.  But the Sixth could</p>
<p>not be given, and the turn of events finally brought me the Fifth</p>
<p>after my cavalry, under the most trying difficulties, had drawn the</p>
<p>enemy from his works, and into such a position as to permit the</p>
<p>realization of General Grant&#x27;s hope to break up with my force Lee&#x27;s</p>
<p>right flank.  Pickett&#x27;s isolation offered an opportunity which we</p>
<p>could not afford to neglect, and the destruction of his command would</p>
<p>fill the measure of General Grant&#x27;s expectations as well as meet my</p>
<p>own desires.  The occasion was not an ordinary one, and as I thought</p>
<p>that Warren had not risen to its demand in the battle, I deemed it</p>
<p>injudicious and unsafe under the critical conditions existing to</p>
<p>retain him longer.  That I was justified in this is plain to all who</p>
<p>are disposed to be fair-minded, so with the following extract from</p>
<p>General Sherman&#x27;s review of the proceedings of the Warren Court, and</p>
<p>with which I am convinced the judgment of history will accord, I</p>
<p>leave the subject:</p>
<p>&quot;....It would be an unsafe and dangerous rule to hold the commander</p>
<p>of an army in battle to a technical adherence to any rule of conduct</p>
<p>for managing his command.  He is responsible for results, and holds</p>
<p>the lives and reputations of every officer and soldier under his</p>
<p>orders as subordinate to the great end--victory.  The most important</p>
<p>events are usually compressed into an hour, a minute, and he cannot</p>
<p>stop to analyze his reasons.  He must act on the impulse, the</p>
<p>conviction, of the instant, and should be sustained in his</p>
<p>conclusions, if not manifestly unjust.  The power to command men, and</p>
<p>give vehement impulse to their joint action, is something which</p>
<p>cannot be defined by words, but it is plain and manifest in battles,</p>
<p>and whoever commands an army in chief must choose his subordinates by</p>
<p>reason of qualities which can alone be tested in actual conflict.</p>
<p>&quot;No one has questioned the patriotism, integrity, and great</p>
<p>intelligence of General Warren.  These are attested by a long record</p>
<p>of most excellent service, but in the clash of arms at and near Five</p>
<p>Forks, March 31 and April 1, 1865, his personal activity fell short</p>
<p>of the standard fixed by General Sheridan, on whom alone rested the</p>
<p>great responsibility for that and succeeding days.</p>
<p>&quot;My conclusion is that General Sheridan was perfectly justified in</p>
<p>his action in this case, and he must be fully and entirely sustained</p>
<p>if the United States expects great victories by her arms in the</p>
<p>future.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<p>RESULT OF THE BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS--RETREAT OF LEE--AN INTERCEPTED</p>
<p>DESPATCH--AT AMELIA COURT HOUSE--BATTLE OF SAILOR&#x27;S CREEK--THE</p>
<p>CONFEDERATES&#x27; STUBBORN RESISTANCE--A COMPLETE VICTORY--IMPORTANCE OF</p>
<p>THE BATTLE.</p>
<p>When the news of the battle at Five Forks reached General Grant, he</p>
<p>realized that the decisive character of our victory would necessitate</p>
<p>the immediate abandonment of Richmond and Petersburg by the enemy;</p>
<p>and fearing that Lee would escape without further injury, he issued</p>
<p>orders, the propriety of which must be settled by history, to assault</p>
<p>next morning the whole intrenched line.  But Lee could not retreat at</p>
<p>once.  He had not anticipated, dissster at Five Forks, and hence was</p>
<p>unprepared to withdraw on the moment; and the necessity of getting</p>
<p>off his trains and munitions of war, as well as being obliged to</p>
<p>cover the flight of the Confederate Government, compelled him to hold</p>
<p>on to Richmond and Petersburg till the afternoon of the 2d, though</p>
<p>before that Parke, Ord, and Wright had carried his outer</p>
<p>intrenchments at several points, thus materially shortening the line</p>
<p>of investment.</p>
<p>The night of the 1st of April, General Humphreys&#x27;s corps-the Second-</p>
<p>had extended its left toward the White Oak road, and early next</p>
<p>morning, under instructions from General Grant, Miles&#x27;s division of</p>
<p>that corps reported to me, and supporting him with Ayres&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Crawford&#x27;s divisions of the Fifth Corps, I then directed him to</p>
<p>advance toward Petersburg and attack the enemy&#x27;s works at the</p>
<p>intersection of the Claiborne and White Oak roads.</p>
<p>Such of the enemy as were still in the works Miles easily forced</p>
<p>across Hatcher&#x27;s Run, in the direction of Sutherland&#x27;s depot, but the</p>
<p>Confederates promptly took up a position north of the little stream,</p>
<p>and Miles being anxious to attack, I gave him leave, but just at this</p>
<p>time General Humphreys came up with a request to me from General</p>
<p>Meade to return Miles.  On this request I relinquished command of the</p>
<p>division, when, supported by the Fifth Corps it could have broken in</p>
<p>the enemy&#x27;s right at a vital point; and I have always since regretted</p>
<p>that I did so, for the message Humphreys conveyed was without</p>
<p>authority from General Grant, by whom Miles had been sent to me, but</p>
<p>thinking good feeling a desideratum just then, and wishing to avoid</p>
<p>wrangles, I faced the Fifth Corps about and marched it down to Five</p>
<p>Forks, and out the Ford road to the crossing of Hatcher&#x27;s Run.  After</p>
<p>we had gone, General Grant, intending this quarter of the field to be</p>
<p>under my control, ordered Humphreys with his other two divisions to</p>
<p>move to the right, in toward Petersburg.  This left Miles entirely</p>
<p>unsupported, and his gallant attack made soon after was unsuccessful</p>
<p>at first, but about 3 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon he carried the point</p>
<p>which covered the retreat from Petersburg and Richmond.</p>
<p>Merritt had been sent westward, meanwhile, in the direction of Ford&#x27;s</p>
<p>Station, to break the enemy&#x27;s horse which had been collecting to the</p>
<p>north of Hatcher&#x27;s Run.  Meeting, with but little opposition, Merritt</p>
<p>drove this cavalry force in a northerly direction toward Scott&#x27;s</p>
<p>Corners, while the Fifth Corps was pushed toward Sutherland&#x27;s depot,</p>
<p>in the hope of coming in on the rear of the force that was</p>
<p>confronting Miles when I left him.  Crawford and Merritt engaged the</p>
<p>enemy lightly just before night, but his main column, retreating</p>
<p>along the river road south of the Appomattox, had got across Namozine</p>
<p>Creek, and the darkness prevented our doing more than to pick up some</p>
<p>stragglers.  The next morning the pursuit was resumed, the cavalry</p>
<p>again in advance, the Fifth Corps keeping up with it all the while,</p>
<p>and as we pressed our adversaries hundreds and hundreds of prisoners,</p>
<p>armed and unarmed, fell into our hands, together with many wagons and</p>
<p>five pieces of artillery.  At Deep Creek the rearguard turned on us,</p>
<p>and a severe skirmish took place.  Merritt, finding the enemy very</p>
<p>strong, was directed to await the arrival of Crook and for the rear</p>
<p>division of the Fifth Corps; but by the time they reached the creek,</p>
<p>darkness had again come to protect the Confederates, and we had to be</p>
<p>content with meagre results at that point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the beginning it was apparent that Lee, in his retreat, was</p>
</blockquote>
<p>making for Amelia Court House, where his columns north and south of</p>
<p>the Appomattox River could join, and where, no doubt, he expected to</p>
<p>meet supplies, so Crook was ordered to march early on April 4 to</p>
<p>strike the Danville railroad, between Jettersville and Burkeville,</p>
<p>and then move south along the railroad toward JettersVille, Merritt</p>
<p>to move toward Amelia Court House, and the Fifth Corps to</p>
<p>Jettersville itself.</p>
<p>The Fifth Corps got to Jettersville about 5 in the afternoon, and I</p>
<p>immediately intrenched it across the Burkeville road with the</p>
<p>determination to stay there till the main army could come up, for I</p>
<p>hoped we could force Lee to surrender at Amelia Court House, since a</p>
<p>firm hold on Jettersville would cut him off from his line of retreat</p>
<p>toward Burkeville.</p>
<p>Accompanied only by my escort--the First United States Cavalry, about</p>
<p>two hundred strong--I reached Jettersville some little time before</p>
<p>the Fifth Corps, and having nothing else at hand I at once deployed</p>
<p>this handful of men to cover the crossroads till the arrival of the</p>
<p>corps.  Just as the troopers were deploying, a man on a mule, heading</p>
<p>for Burkeville, rode into my pickets.  He was arrested, of course,</p>
<p>and being searched there was found in his boots this telegram in</p>
<p>duplicate, signed by Lee&#x27;s Commissary General.</p>
<p>&quot;The army is at Amelia Court House, short of provisions.  Send</p>
<p>300,000 rations quickly to BurkeVille Junction.&quot; One copy was</p>
<p>addressed to the supply department at Danville, and the other to that</p>
<p>at Lynchburg.  I surmised that the telegraph lines north of</p>
<p>Burkeville had been broken by Crook after the despatches were</p>
<p>written, which would account for their being transmitted by</p>
<p>messenger.  There was thus revealed not only the important fact that</p>
<p>Lee was concentrating at Amelia Court House, but also a trustworthy</p>
<p>basis for estimating his troops, so I sent word to Crook to strike up</p>
<p>the railroad toward me, and to Merritt--who, as I have said, had</p>
<p>followed on the heels of the enemy--to leave Mackenzie there and</p>
<p>himself close in on Jettersville.  Staff-officers were also</p>
<p>despatched to hurry up Griffin with theFifth Corps, and his tired men</p>
<p>redoubled their strides.</p>
<p>My troops too were hard up for rations, for in the pursuit we could</p>
<p>not wait for our trains, so I concluded to secure if possible these</p>
<p>provisions intended for Lee.  To this end I directed Young to send</p>
<p>four of his best scouts to Burkeville Junction.  There they were to</p>
<p>separate, two taking the railroad toward Lynchburg and two toward</p>
<p>Danville, and as soon as a telegraph station was reached the telegram</p>
<p>was to be transmitted as it had been written and the provisions thus</p>
<p>hurried forward.</p>
<p>Although the Fifth Corps arrived at Jettersville the evening of April</p>
<p>4, as did also Crook&#x27;s and Merritt&#x27;s cavalry, yet none of the army of</p>
<p>the Potomac came up till about 3 o&#x27;clock the afternoon of the 5th,</p>
<p>the Second Corps, followed by the Sixth, joining us then.  General</p>
<p>Meade arrived at Jettersville an hour earlier, but being ill,</p>
<p>requested me to put his troops in position.  The Fifth Corps being</p>
<p>already intrenched across the Amelia Court House road facing north, I</p>
<p>placed the Sixth on its right and the Second on its left as they</p>
<p>reached the ground.</p>
<p>As the enemy had been feeling us ever since morning--to learn what he</p>
<p>was up to I directed Crook to send Davies&#x27;s brigade on a</p>
<p>reconnoissance to Paine&#x27;s crossroads.  Davies soon found out that Lee</p>
<p>was trying to escape by that flank, for at the crossroads he found</p>
<p>the Confederate trains and artillery moving rapidly westward.  Having</p>
<p>driven away the escort, Davies succeeded in burning nearly two</p>
<p>hundred wagons, and brought off five pieces of artillery.  Among</p>
<p>these wagons were some belonging to General, Lee&#x27;s and to General</p>
<p>Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s headquarters.  This work through, Davies withdrew and</p>
<p>rejoined Crook, who, with Smith and Gregg, was established near Flat</p>
<p>Creek.</p>
<p>It being plain that Lee would attempt to escape as soon as his trains</p>
<p>were out of the way, I was most anxious to attack him when the Second</p>
<p>Corps began to arrive, for I felt certain that unless we did so he</p>
<p>would succeed in passing by our left flank, and would thus again make</p>
<p>our pursuit a stern-chase; but General Meade, whose plan of attack</p>
<p>was to advance his right flank on Amelia Court House, objected to</p>
<p>assailing before all his troops were up.</p>
<p>I then sent despatches to General Grant, explaining what Davies had</p>
<p>done, and telling him that the Second Corps was arriving, and that I</p>
<p>wished he himself was present.  I assured him of my confidence in our</p>
<p>capturing Lee if we properly exerted ourselves, and informed him,</p>
<p>finally, that I would put all my cavalry, except Mackenzie, on my</p>
<p>left, and that, with such a disposition of my forces, I could see no</p>
<p>escape for Lee.  I also inclosed him this letter, which had just been</p>
<p>captured:</p>
<p>&quot;AMELIA C. H., April 5, 1865.</p>
<p>DEAR MAMMA:</p>
<p>&quot;Our army is ruined, I fear.  We are all safe as yet.  Shyron left us</p>
<p>sick.  John Taylor is well--saw him yesterday.  We are in line of</p>
<p>battle this morning.  General Robert Lee is in the field near us.  My</p>
<p>trust is still in the justice of our cause, and that of God.  General</p>
<p>Hill is killed.  I saw Murray a few minutes since.  Bernard, Terry</p>
<p>said, was taken prisoner, but may yet get out.  I send this by a</p>
<p>negro I see passing up the railroad to Mechlenburg.  Love to all.</p>
<p>&quot;Your devoted son,</p>
<p>&quot;Wm. B. TAYLOR, Colonel.&quot;</p>
<p>General Grant, who on the 5th was accompanying General Ord&#x27;s column</p>
<p>toward Burkeville Junction, did not receive this intelligence till</p>
<p>nearly nightfall, when within about ten miles of the Junction.  He</p>
<p>set out for Jettersville immediately, but did not reach us till near</p>
<p>midnight, too late of course to do anything that night.  Taking me</p>
<p>with him, we went over to see Meade, whom he then directed to advance</p>
<p>early in the morning on Amelia Court House.  In this interview Grant</p>
<p>also stated that the orders Meade had already issued would permit</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s escape, and therefore must be changed, for it was not the aim</p>
<p>only to follow the enemy, but to get ahead of him, remarking during</p>
<p>the conversation that, &quot;he had no doubt Lee was moving right then.&quot;</p>
<p>On this same occasion Meade expressed a desire to have in the</p>
<p>proposed attack all the troops of the Army of the Potomac under his</p>
<p>own command, and asked for the return of the Fifth Corps.  I made no</p>
<p>objections, and it was ordered to report, to him.</p>
<p>When, on the morning of the 6th, Meade advanced toward Amelia Court</p>
<p>House, he found, as predicted, that Lee was gone.  It turned out that</p>
<p>the retreat began the evening of the 5th and continued all night.</p>
<p>Satisfied that this would be the case, I did not permit the cavalry</p>
<p>to participate in Meade&#x27;s useless advance, but shifted it out toward</p>
<p>the left to the road running from Deatonsville to Rice&#x27;s station,</p>
<p>Crook leading and Merritt close up.  Before long the enemy&#x27;s trains</p>
<p>were discovered on this road, but Crook could make but little</p>
<p>impression on them, they were so strongly guarded; so, leaving</p>
<p>Stagg&#x27;s brigade and Miller&#x27;s battery about three miles southwest of</p>
<p>Deatonsville--where the road forks, with a branch leading north</p>
<p>toward the Appomattox--to harass the retreating column and find a</p>
<p>vulnerable point, I again shifted the rest of the cavalry toward the</p>
<p>left, across-country, but still keeping parallel to the enemy&#x27;s line</p>
<p>of march.</p>
<p>Just after crossing Sailor&#x27;s Greek, a favorable opportunity offering,</p>
<p>both Merritt and Crook attacked vigorously, gained the Rice&#x27;s Station</p>
<p>road, destroyed several hundred wagons, made many prisoners, and</p>
<p>captured sixteen pieces of artillery.  This was important, but more</p>
<p>valuable still was the fact that we were astride the enemy&#x27;s line of</p>
<p>retreat, and had cut off from joining Longstreet, waiting at Rice&#x27;s</p>
<p>Station, a corps of Confederate infantry under General Ewell,</p>
<p>composed of Anderson&#x27;s, Kershaw&#x27;s, and Custis Lee&#x27;s divisions.</p>
<p>Stagg&#x27;s brigade and Miller&#x27;s battery, which, as I have said, had been</p>
<p>left at the forks of the Deatonsville road, had meanwhile broken in</p>
<p>between the rear of Ewell&#x27;s column and the head of Gordon&#x27;s, forcing</p>
<p>Gordon to abandon his march for Rice&#x27;s Station, and to take the</p>
<p>right-hand road at the forks, on which he was pursued by General</p>
<p>Humphreys.</p>
<p>The complete isolation of Ewell from Longstreet in his front and</p>
<p>Gordon in his rear led to the battle of Sailor&#x27;s Creek, one of the</p>
<p>severest conflicts of the war, for the enemy fought with desperation</p>
<p>to escape capture, and we, bent on his destruction, were no less</p>
<p>eager and determined.  The capture of Ewell, with six of his generals</p>
<p>and most of his troops, crowned our success, but the fight was so</p>
<p>overshadowed by the stirring events of the surrender three days</p>
<p>later, that the battle has never been accorded the prominence it</p>
<p>deserves.</p>
<p>The small creek from which the field takes its name flows in a</p>
<p>northwesterly direction across the road leading from Deatonsville to</p>
<p>Rice&#x27;s Station.  By shifting to the left, Merritt gained the Rice&#x27;s</p>
<p>Station road west of the creek, making havoc of the wagon-trains,</p>
<p>while Crook struck them further on and planted himself square across</p>
<p>the road.  This blocked Ewell, who, advancing Anderson to some high</p>
<p>ground west of the creek, posted him behind barricades, with the</p>
<p>intention of making a hard fight there, while the main body should</p>
<p>escape through the woods in a westerly direction to roads that led to</p>
<p>Farmville.  This was prevented, however, by Crook forming his</p>
<p>division, two brigades dismounted and one mounted, and at once</p>
<p>assaulting all along Anderson&#x27;s front and overlapping his right,</p>
<p>while Merritt fiercely attacked to the right of Crook.  The enemy</p>
<p>being thus held, enabled the Sixth Corps--which in the meantime I had</p>
<p>sent for--to come upon the ground, and Ewell, still contending with</p>
<p>the cavalry, found himself suddenly beset by this new danger from his</p>
<p>rear.  To, meet it, he placed Kershaw to the right and Custis Lee to</p>
<p>the left of the Rice&#x27;s Station road, facing them north toward and</p>
<p>some little distance from Sailor&#x27;s Creek, supporting Kershaw with</p>
<p>Commander Tucker&#x27;s Marine brigade.  Ewell&#x27;s skirmishers held the line</p>
<p>of Sailor&#x27;s Creek, which runs through a gentle valley, the north</p>
<p>slope of which was cleared ground.</p>
<p>By General Grant&#x27;s directions the Sixth Corps had been following my</p>
<p>route of march since the discovery, about 9 o&#x27;clock in the morning,</p>
<p>that Lee had decamped from Amelia Court House.  Grant had promptly</p>
<p>informed me of this in a note, saying, &quot;The Sixth Corps will go in</p>
<p>with a vim any place you may dictate,&quot; so when I sent word to Wright</p>
<p>of the enemy&#x27;s isolation, and asked him to hurry on with all speed,</p>
<p>his gallant corps came as fast as legs could carry them, he sending</p>
<p>to me successively Major McClellan and Colonel Franklin, of his</p>
<p>staff, to report his approach.</p>
<p>I was well advised as to the position of the enemy through</p>
<p>information brought me by an intelligent young soldier, William A.</p>
<p>Richardson, Company &quot;A,&quot; Second Ohio, who, in one of the cavalry</p>
<p>charges on Anderson, had cleared the barricades and made his way back</p>
<p>to my front through Ewell&#x27;s line.  Richardson had told me just how</p>
<p>the main body of the enemy was posted, so as Seymour&#x27;s division</p>
<p>arrived I directed General Wright to put it on the right of the road,</p>
<p>while Wheaton&#x27;s men, coming up all hot and out of breath, promptly</p>
<p>formed on Seymour&#x27;s left.  Both divisions thus aligned faced</p>
<p>southwest toward Sailor&#x27;s Creek, and the artillery of the corps being</p>
<p>massed to the left and front of the Hibbon house, without waiting for</p>
<p>Getty&#x27;s division--for I feared that if we delayed longer the enemy</p>
<p>might effect his escape toward Farmville--the general attack was</p>
<p>begun.  Seymour and Wheaton, moving forward together, assailed the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s front and left, and Stagg&#x27;s brigade, too, which in the mean</p>
<p>time had been placed between Wheaton&#x27;s left and Devin&#x27;s right, went</p>
<p>at him along with them, Merritt and Crook resuming the fight from</p>
<p>their positions in front of Anderson.  The enemy, seeing little</p>
<p>chance of escape, fought like a tiger at bay, but both Seymour and</p>
<p>Wheaton pressed him vigorously, gaining ground at all points except</p>
<p>just to the right of the road, where Seymour&#x27;s left was checked.</p>
<p>Here the Confederates burst back on us in a counter-charge, surging</p>
<p>down almost to the creek, but the artillery, supported by Getty, who</p>
<p>in the mean time had come on the ground, opened on them so terribly</p>
<p>that this audacious and furious onset was completely broken, though</p>
<p>the gallant fellows fell back to their original line doggedly, and</p>
<p>not until after they had almost gained the creek.  Ewell was now</p>
<p>hemmed in on every side, and all those under his immediate command</p>
<p>were captured.  Merritt and Crook had also broken up Anderson by this</p>
<p>time, but he himself, and about two thousand disorganized men escaped</p>
<p>by making their way through the woods toward the Appomattox River</p>
<p>before they could be entirely enveloped.  Night had fallen when the</p>
<p>fight was entirely over, but Devin was pushed on in pursuit for about</p>
<p>two miles, part of the Sixth Corps following to clinch a victory</p>
<p>which not only led to the annihilation of one corps of Lee&#x27;s</p>
<p>retreating army, but obliged Longstreet to move up to Farmville, so</p>
<p>as to take a road north of the Appomattox River toward Lynchburg</p>
<p>instead of continuing toward Danville.</p>
<p>At the close of the battle I sent one of my staff--Colonel Redwood</p>
<p>Price--to General Grant to report what had been done; that we had</p>
<p>taken six generals and from nine to ten thousand prisoners.  On his</p>
<p>way Price stopped at the headquarters of General Meade, where he</p>
<p>learned that not the slightest intelligence of the occurrence on my</p>
<p>line had been received, for I not being under Meade&#x27;s command, he had</p>
<p>paid no attention to my movements.  Price gave the story of the</p>
<p>battle, and General Meade, realizing its importance, sent directions</p>
<p>immediately to General Wright to make his report of the engagement to</p>
<p>the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac, assuming that Wright was</p>
<p>operating independently of me in the face of Grant&#x27;s despatch Of</p>
<p>2 o&#x27;clock, which said that Wright was following the cavalry and would</p>
<p>&quot;go in with a vim&quot; wherever I dictated.  Wright could not do else</p>
<p>than comply with Meade&#x27;s orders in the case, and I, being then in</p>
<p>ignorance of Meade&#x27;s reasons for the assumption, could say nothing.</p>
<p>But General Grant plainly intending, and even directing, that the</p>
<p>corps should be under my command, remedied this phase of the matter,</p>
<p>when informed of what had taken place, by requiring Wright to send a</p>
<p>report of the battle through me.  What he then did, and what his</p>
<p>intentions and orders were, are further confirmed by a reference to</p>
<p>the episode in his &quot;Memoirs,&quot; where he gives his reasons for ordering</p>
<p>the Sixth Corps to abandon the move on Amelia Court House and pass to</p>
<p>the left of the army.  On the same page he also says, referring to</p>
<p>the 6th of April: &quot;The Sixth Corps now remained with the cavalry</p>
<p>under Sheridan&#x27;s direct command until after the surrender.&quot;  He</p>
<p>unquestionably intended all of this, but his purpose was partly</p>
<p>frustrated by General Meade&#x27;s action next morning in assuming</p>
<p>direction of the movements of the corps; and before General Grant</p>
<p>became aware of the actual conditions the surrender was at hand.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<p>LINCOLN&#x27;S LACONIC DESPATCH--CAPTURING LEE&#x27;S SUPPLIES--DELIGHTED</p>
<p>ENGINEERS--THE CONFEDERATES&#x27; LAST EFFORT--A FLAG OF TRUCE--GENERAL</p>
<p>GEARY&#x27;S &quot;LAST DITCH&quot; ABSURDITY--MEETING OF GRANT AND LEE--THE</p>
<p>SURRENDER--ESTIMATE OF GENERAL GRANT.</p>
<p>The first report of the battle of Sailor&#x27;s Creek that General Grant</p>
<p>received was, as already stated, an oral message carried by Colonel</p>
<p>Price, of my staff.  Near midnight I sent a despatch giving the names</p>
<p>of the generals captured.  These were Ewell, Kershaw, Barton, Corse,</p>
<p>Dubose, and Custis Lee.  In the same despatch I wrote: &quot;If the thing</p>
<p>is pressed, I think that Lee will surrender.&quot;  When Mr. Lincoln, at</p>
<p>City Point, received this word from General Grant, who was</p>
<p>transmitting every item of news to the President, he telegraphed</p>
<p>Grant the laconic message: &quot;Let the thing be pressed.&quot; The morning of</p>
<p>the 7th we moved out at a very early hour, Crook&#x27;s division marching</p>
<p>toward Farmville in direct pursuit, while Merritt and Mackenzie were</p>
<p>ordered to Prince Edward&#x27;s Court House to anticipate any effort Lee</p>
<p>might make to escape through that place toward Danville since it had</p>
<p>been discovered that Longstreet had slipped away already from the</p>
<p>front of General Ord&#x27;s troops at Rice&#x27;s Station.  Crook overtook the</p>
<p>main body of the Confederates at Farmville, and promptly attacked</p>
<p>their trains on the north side of the Appomattox with Gregg&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade, which was fiercely turned upon and forced to re-cross the</p>
<p>river with the loss of a number of prisoner&#x27;s, among them Gregg</p>
<p>himself.  When Crook sent word of this fight, it was clear that Lee</p>
<p>had abandoned all effort to escape to the southwest by way of</p>
<p>Danville.  Lynchburg was undoubtedly his objective point now; so,</p>
<p>resolving to throw my cavalry again across his path, and hold him</p>
<p>till the infantry could overtake him, I directed everything on</p>
<p>Appomattox depot, recalling Crook the night of the 7th to Prospect</p>
<p>Station, while Merritt camped at Buffalo Creek, and Mackenzie made a</p>
<p>reconnoissance along the Lynchburg railroad.</p>
<p>At break of day, April 8, Merritt and Mackenzie united with Crook at</p>
<p>Prospect Station, and the cavalry all moved then toward Appomattox</p>
<p>depot.  Hardly had it started when one of the scouts--Sergeant White-</p>
<p>-informed me that there were four trains of cars at the depot loaded</p>
<p>with supplies for Lee&#x27;s army; these had been sent from Lynchburg, in</p>
<p>compliance with the telegram of Lee&#x27;s commissary-general, which</p>
<p>message, it will be remembered, was captured and transmitted to</p>
<p>Lynchburg by two of Young&#x27;s scouts on the 4th.  Sergeant White, who</p>
<p>had been on the lookout for the trains ever since sending the</p>
<p>despatch, found them several miles west of Appomattox depot feeling</p>
<p>their way along, in ignorance of Lee&#x27;s exact position.  As he had the</p>
<p>original despatch with him, and took pains to dwell upon the pitiable</p>
<p>condition of Lee&#x27;s army, he had little difficulty in persuading the</p>
<p>men in charge of the trains to bring them east of Appomattox Station,</p>
<p>but fearing that the true state of affairs would be learned before</p>
<p>long, and the trains be returned to Lynchburg, he was painfully</p>
<p>anxious to have them cut off by breaking the track west of the</p>
<p>station.</p>
<p>The intelligence as to the trains was immediately despatched to</p>
<p>Crook, and I pushed on to join him with Merritt&#x27;s command.  Custer</p>
<p>having the advance, moved rapidly, and on nearing the station</p>
<p>detailed two regiments to make a detour southward to strike the</p>
<p>railroad some distance beyond and break the track.  These regiments</p>
<p>set off at a gallop, and in short order broke up the railroad enough</p>
<p>to prevent the escape of the trains, Custer meanwhile taking</p>
<p>possession of the station, but none too soon, for almost at the</p>
<p>moment he did so the advance-guard of Lee&#x27;s army appeared, bent on</p>
<p>securing the trains.  Without halting to look after the cars further,</p>
<p>Custer attacked this advance-guard and had a spirited fight, in which</p>
<p>he drove the Confederates away from the station, captured twenty-five</p>
<p>pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large park of wagons,</p>
<p>which, in the hope that they would reach Lynchburg next day, were</p>
<p>being pushed ahead of Lee&#x27;s main body.</p>
<p>Devin coming up a little before dusk, was put in on the right of</p>
<p>Custer, and one of Crook&#x27;s brigades was sent to our left and the</p>
<p>other two held in reserve.  I then forced the enemy back on the</p>
<p>Appomattox road to the vicinity of the Court House, and that the</p>
<p>Confederates might have no rest, gave orders to continue the</p>
<p>skirmishing throughout the night.  Meanwhile the captured trains had</p>
<p>been taken charge of by locomotive engineers, soldiers of the</p>
<p>command, who were delighted evidently to get back at their old</p>
<p>calling.  They amused themselves by running the trains to and fro,</p>
<p>creating much confusion, and keeping up such an unearthly screeching</p>
<p>with the whistles that I was on the point of ordering the cars</p>
<p>burned.  They finally wearied of their fun, however, and ran the</p>
<p>trains off to the east toward General Ord&#x27;s column.</p>
<p>The night of the 8th I made my headquarters at a little frame house</p>
<p>just south of the station.  I did not sleep at all, nor did anybody</p>
<p>else, the entire command being up all night long; indeed, there had</p>
<p>been little rest in the, cavalry for the past eight days.  The</p>
<p>necessity of getting Ord&#x27;s column up was so obvious now that staff-</p>
<p>officer after staff-officer was sent to him and to General Grant</p>
<p>requesting that the infantry be pushed on, for if it could get to the</p>
<p>front, all knew that the rebellion would be ended on the morrow.</p>
<p>Merritt, Crook, Custer, and Devin were present at frequent intervals</p>
<p>during the night, and everybody was overjoyed at the prospect that</p>
<p>our weary work was about to end so happily.  Before sun-up General</p>
<p>Ord arrived, and informed me of the approach of his column, it having</p>
<p>been marching the whole night.  As he ranked me, of course I could</p>
<p>give him no orders, so after a hasty consultation as to where his</p>
<p>troops should be placed we separated, I riding to the front to</p>
<p>overlook my line near Appomattox Court House, while he went back to</p>
<p>urge along his weary troops.</p>
<p>The night before General Lee had held a council with his principal</p>
<p>generals, when it was arranged that in the morning General Gordon</p>
<p>should undertake to break through my cavalry, and when I neared my</p>
<p>troops this movement was beginning, a heavy line of infantry bearing</p>
<p>down on us from the direction of the village.  In front of Crook and</p>
<p>Mackenzie firing had already begun, so riding to a slight elevation</p>
<p>where a good view of the Confederates could be had, I there came to</p>
<p>the conclusion that it would be unwise to offer more resistance than</p>
<p>that necessary to give Ord time to form, so I directed Merritt to</p>
<p>fall back, and in retiring to shift Devin and Custer to the right so</p>
<p>as to make room for Ord, now in the woods to my rear.  Crook, who</p>
<p>with his own and Mackenzie&#x27;s divisions was on my extreme left</p>
<p>covering some by-roads, was ordered to hold his ground as long as</p>
<p>practicable without sacrificing his men, and, if forced to retire, to</p>
<p>contest with obstinacy the enemy&#x27;s advance.</p>
<p>As already stated, I could not direct General Ord&#x27;s course, he being</p>
<p>my senior, but hastily galloping back to where he was, at the edge of</p>
<p>the timber, I explained to him what was taking place at the front.</p>
<p>Merritt&#x27;s withdrawal inspired the Confederates, who forthwith began</p>
<p>to press Crook, their line of battle advancing with confidence till</p>
<p>it reached the crest whence I had reconnoitred them.  From this</p>
<p>ground they could see Ord&#x27;s men emerging from the woods, and the</p>
<p>hopelessness of a further attack being plain, the gray lines</p>
<p>instinctively halted, and then began to retire toward a ridge</p>
<p>immediately fronting Appomattox Court House, while Ord, joined on his</p>
<p>right by the Fifth Corps, advanced on them over the ground that</p>
<p>Merritt had abandoned.</p>
<p>I now directed my steps toward Merritt, who, having mounted his</p>
<p>troopers, had moved them off to the right, and by the time I reached</p>
<p>his headquarters flag he was ready for work, so a move on the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>left was ordered, and every guidon was bent to the front.  As the</p>
<p>cavalry marched along parallel with the Confederate line, and in</p>
<p>toward its left, a heavy fire of artillery opened on us, but this</p>
<p>could not check us at such a time, and we soon reached some high</p>
<p>ground about half a mile from the Court House, and from here I could</p>
<p>see in the low valley beyond the village the bivouac undoubtedly of</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s army.  The troops did not seem to be disposed in battle order,</p>
<p>but on the other side of the bivouac was a line of battle--a heavy</p>
<p>rear-guard--confronting, presumably, General Meade.</p>
<p>I decided to attack at once, and formations were ordered at a trot</p>
<p>for a charge by Custer&#x27;s and Devin&#x27;s divisions down the slope leading</p>
<p>to the camps.  Custer was soon ready, but Devin&#x27;s division being in</p>
<p>rear its formation took longer, since he had to shift further to the</p>
<p>right; Devin&#x27;s preparations were, therefore, but partially completed</p>
<p>when an aide-decamp galloped up to with the word from Custer, &quot;Lee</p>
<p>has surrendered; do not charge; the white flag is up.&quot;  The enemy</p>
<p>perceiving that Custer was forming for attack, had sent the flag out</p>
<p>to his front and stopped the charge just in time.  I at once sent</p>
<p>word of the truce to General Ord, and hearing nothing more from</p>
<p>Custer himself, I supposed that he had gone down to the Court House</p>
<p>to join a mounted group of Confederates that I could see near there,</p>
<p>so I, too, went toward them, galloping down a narrow ridge, staff and</p>
<p>orderlies following; but we had not got half way to the Court House</p>
<p>when, from a skirt of timber to our right, not more than three</p>
<p>hundred yards distant, a musketry fire was opened on us.  This halted</p>
<p>us, when, waving my hat, I called out to the firing party that we</p>
<p>were under a truce, and they were violating it.  This did not stop</p>
<p>them, however, so we hastily took shelter in a ravine so situated as</p>
<p>to throw a ridge between us and the danger.</p>
<p>We traveled in safety down this depression to its mouth, and thence</p>
<p>by a gentle ascent approached the Court House.  I was in advance,</p>
<p>followed by a sergeant carrying my battleflag.  When I got within</p>
<p>about a hundred and fifty yards of the enemy&#x27;s line, which was</p>
<p>immediately in front of the Court House, some of the Confederates</p>
<p>leveled their pieces at us, and I again halted.  Their officers kept</p>
<p>their men from firing, however, but meanwhile a single-handed contest</p>
<p>had begun behind me, for on looking back I heard a Confederate</p>
<p>soldier demanding my battle-flag from the color-bearer, thinking, no</p>
<p>doubt, that we were coming in as prisoners.  The sergeant had drawn</p>
<p>his sabre and was about to cut the man down, but at a word from me he</p>
<p>desisted and carried the flag back to my staff, his assailant quickly</p>
<p>realizing that the boot was on the other leg.</p>
<p>These incidents determined me to remain where I was till the return</p>
<p>of a staff-officer whom I had sent over to demand an explanation from</p>
<p>the group of Confederates for which I had been heading.  He came back</p>
<p>in a few minutes with apologies for what had occurred, and informed</p>
<p>me that General Gordon and General Wilcox were the superior officers</p>
<p>in the group.  As they wished me to join them I rode up with my</p>
<p>staff, but we had hardly met when in front of Merritt firing began.</p>
<p>At the sound I turned to General Gordon, who seemed embarrassed by</p>
<p>the occurrence, and remarked: &quot;General, your men fired on me as I was</p>
<p>coming over here, and undoubtedly they are treating Merritt and</p>
<p>Custer the same way.  We might as well let them fight it out.&quot;  He</p>
<p>replied, &quot;There must be some mistake.&quot;  I then asked, &quot;Why not send a</p>
<p>staff-officer and have your people cease firing; they are violating</p>
<p>the flag.&quot; He answered, &quot;I have no staff-officer to send.&quot;  Whereupon</p>
<p>I said that I would let him have one of mine, and calling for</p>
<p>Lieutenant Vanderbilt Allen, I directed him to carry General Gordon&#x27;s</p>
<p>orders to General Geary, commanding a small brigade of South Carolina</p>
<p>cavalry, to discontinue firing.  Allen dashed off with the message</p>
<p>and soon delivered it, but was made a prisoner, Geary saying, &quot;I do</p>
<p>not care for white flags: South Carolinians never surrender....&quot;  By</p>
<p>this time Merritt&#x27;s patience being exhausted, he ordered an attack,</p>
<p>and this in short order put an end to General Geary&#x27;s &quot;last ditch&quot;</p>
<p>absurdity, and extricated Allen from his predicament.</p>
<p>When quiet was restored Gordon remarked: &quot;General Lee asks for a</p>
<p>suspension of hostilities pending the negotiations which he is having</p>
<p>with General Grant.&quot;  I rejoined: &quot;I have been constantly informed of</p>
<p>the progress of the negotiations, and think it singular that while</p>
<p>such discussions are going on, General Lee should have continued his</p>
<p>march and attempted to break through my lines this morning.  I will</p>
<p>entertain no terms except that General Lee shall surrender to General</p>
<p>Grant on his arrival here.  If these terms are not accepted we will</p>
<p>renew hostilities.&quot;  Gordon replied: &quot;General Lee&#x27;s army is</p>
<p>exhausted.  There is no doubt of his surrender to General Grant.&quot;</p>
<p>It was then that General Ord joined us, and after shaking hands all</p>
<p>around, I related the situation to him, and Gordon went away agreeing</p>
<p>to meet us again in half an hour.  When the time was up he came back</p>
<p>accompanied by General Longstreet, who brought with him a despatch,</p>
<p>the duplicate of one that had been sent General Grant through General</p>
<p>Meade&#x27;s lines back on the road over which Lee had been retreating.</p>
<p>General Longstreet renewed the assurances that already had been given</p>
<p>by Gordon, and I sent Colonel Newhall with the despatch to find</p>
<p>General Grant and bring him to the front.  When Newhall started,</p>
<p>everything on our side of the Appomattox Court House was quiet, for</p>
<p>inevitable surrender was at hand, but Longstreet feared that Meade,</p>
<p>in ignorance of the new conditions on my front might attack the</p>
<p>Confederate rearguard.  To prevent this I offered to send Colonel J.</p>
<p>W. Forsyth through the enemy&#x27;s lines to let Meade know of my</p>
<p>agreement, for he too was suspicious that by a renewed correspondence</p>
<p>Lee was endeavoring to gain time for escape.  My offer being</p>
<p>accepted, Forsyth set out accompanied by Colonel Fairfax, of</p>
<p>Longstreet&#x27;s staff, and had no difficulty in accomplishing his</p>
<p>mission.</p>
<p>About five or six miles from Appomattox, on the road toward Prospect</p>
<p>Station near its intersection with the Walker&#x27;s Church road, my</p>
<p>adjutant-general, Colonel Newhall, met General Grant, he having</p>
<p>started from north of the Appomattox River for my front the morning</p>
<p>of April 9, in consequence of the following despatches which had been</p>
<p>sent him the night before, after we had captured Appomattox Station</p>
<p>and established a line intercepting Lee:</p>
<p>&quot;CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS, April 8, 1865--9:20 P. M.</p>
<p>&quot;LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Armies of the U.  S.</p>
<p>&quot;General: I marched early this morning from Buffalo Creek and</p>
<p>Prospect Station on Appomattox Station, where my scouts had reported</p>
<p>trains of cars with supplies for Lee&#x27;s army.  A short time before</p>
<p>dark General Custer, who had the advance, made a dash at the station,</p>
<p>capturing four trains of supplies with locomotives.  One of the</p>
<p>trains was burned and the others were run back toward Farmville for</p>
<p>security.  Custer then pushed on toward Appomattox Court House,</p>
<p>driving the enemy--who kept up a heavy fire of artillery--charging</p>
<p>them repeatedly and capturing, as far as reported, twenty-five pieces</p>
<p>of artillery and a number of prisoners and wagons.  The First Cavalry</p>
<p>Division supported him on the right.  A reconnoissance sent across</p>
<p>the Appomattox reports the enemy moving on the Cumberland road to</p>
<p>Appomattox Station, where they expect to get supplies.  Custer is</p>
<p>still pushing on.  If General Gibbon and the Fifth Corps can get up</p>
<p>to-night, we will perhaps finish the job in the morning.  I do not</p>
<p>think Lee means to surrender until compelled to do so.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, April 8, 1865--9:40 p.m.</p>
<p>&quot;LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Armies U. S.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL: Since writing tne accompanying despatch, General Custer</p>
<p>reports that his command has captured in all thirty-five pieces of</p>
<p>artillery, one thousand prisoners--including one general officer--and</p>
<p>from one hundred and fifty to two hundred wagons.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.&quot;</p>
<p>In attempting to conduct the lieutenant-general and staff back by a</p>
<p>short route, Newhall lost his bearings for a time, inclining in</p>
<p>toward the enemy&#x27;s lines too far, but regained the proper direction</p>
<p>without serious loss of time.  General Grant arrived about 1 o&#x27;clock</p>
<p>in the afternoon, Ord and I, dismounted, meeting him at the edge of</p>
<p>the town, or crossroads, for it was little more.  He remaining</p>
<p>mounted, spoke first to me, saying simply,</p>
<p>&quot;How are you, Sheridan?&quot;  I assured him with thanks that I was</p>
<p>&quot;first-rate,&quot; when, pointing toward the village, he asked, &quot;Is</p>
<p>General Lee up there?&quot; and I replied: There is his army down in that</p>
<p>valley, and he himself is over in that house (designating McLean&#x27;s</p>
<p>house) waiting to surrender to you.&quot;  The General then said, &quot;Come,</p>
<p>let us go over,&quot; this last remark being addressed to both Ord and me.</p>
<p>We two then mounted and joined him, while our staff-officers</p>
<p>followed, intermingling with those of the general-in-chief as the</p>
<p>cavalcade took its way to McLean&#x27;s house near by, and where General</p>
<p>Lee had arrived some time before, in consequence of a message from</p>
<p>General Grant consenting to the interview asked for by Lee through</p>
<p>Meade&#x27;s front that morning--the consent having been carried by</p>
<p>Colonel Babcock.</p>
<p>When I entered McLean&#x27;s house General Lee was standing, as was also</p>
<p>his military secretary, Colonel Marshall, his only staff-officer</p>
<p>present.  General Lee was dressed in a new uniform and wore a</p>
<p>handsome sword.  His tall, commanding form thus set off contrasted</p>
<p>strongly with the short figure of General Grant, clothed as he was in</p>
<p>a soiled suit, without sword or other insignia of his position except</p>
<p>a pair of dingy shoulder-straps.  After being presented, Ord and I,</p>
<p>and nearly all of General Grant&#x27;s staff, withdrew to await the</p>
<p>agreement as to terms, and in a little while Colonel Babcock came to</p>
<p>the door and said, &quot;The surrender had been made; you can come in</p>
<p>again.&quot;</p>
<p>When we re-entered General Grant was writing; and General Lee, having</p>
<p>in his hand two despatches, which I that morning requested might be</p>
<p>returned, as I had no copies of them, addressed me with the remark:</p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry.  It is probable that my cavalry at that point of the</p>
<p>line did not fully understand the agreement.&quot; These despatches had</p>
<p>been sent in the forenoon, after the fighting had been stopped,</p>
<p>notifying General Lee that some of his cavalry in front of Crook was</p>
<p>violating the suspension of hostilities by withdrawing.  About</p>
<p>3 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon the terms of surrender were written out</p>
<p>and accepted, and General Lee left the house, as he departed</p>
<p>cordially shaking hands with General Grant.  A moment later he</p>
<p>mounted his chunky gray horse, and lifting his hat as he passed out</p>
<p>of the yard, rode off toward his army, his arrival there being</p>
<p>announced to us by cheering, which, as it progressed, varying in</p>
<p>loudness, told he was riding through the bivouac of the Army of</p>
<p>Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>The surrender of General Lee practically ended the war of the</p>
<p>rebellion.  For four years his army had been the main-stay of the</p>
<p>Confederacy; and the marked ability with which he directed its</p>
<p>operations is evidenced both by his frequent successes and the length</p>
<p>of time he kept up the contest.  Indeed, it may be said that till</p>
<p>General Grant was matched against him, he never met an opponent he</p>
<p>did not vanquish, for while it is true that defeat was inflicted on</p>
<p>the Confederates at Antietam and Gettysburg, yet the fruits of these</p>
<p>victories were not gathered, for after each of these battles Lee was</p>
<p>left unmolested till he had a chance to recuperate.</p>
<p>The assignment of General Grant to the command of the Union armies in</p>
<p>the winter of 1863-64 gave presage of success from the start, for his</p>
<p>eminent abilities had already been proved, and besides, he was a</p>
<p>tower of strength to the Government, because he had the confidence of</p>
<p>the people.  They knew that henceforth systematic direction would be</p>
<p>given to our armies in every section of the vast territory over which</p>
<p>active operations were being prosecuted, and further, that this</p>
<p>coherence, this harmony of plan, was the one thing needed to end the</p>
<p>war, for in the three preceding years there had been illustrated most</p>
<p>lamentable effects of the absence of system.  From the moment he set</p>
<p>our armies in motion simultaneously, in the spring of 1864, it could</p>
<p>be seen that we should be victorious ultimately, for though on</p>
<p>different lines we were checked now and then, yet we were harassing</p>
<p>the Confederacy at so many vital points that plainly it must yield to</p>
<p>our blows.  Against Lee&#x27;s army, the forefront of the Confederacy,</p>
<p>Grant pitted himself; and it may be said that the Confederate</p>
<p>commander was now, for the first time, overmatched, for against all</p>
<p>his devices--the products of a mind fertile in defense--General Grant</p>
<p>brought to bear not only the wealth of expedient which had hitherto</p>
<p>distinguished him, but also an imperturbable tenacity, particularly</p>
<p>in the Wilderness and on the march to the James, without which the</p>
<p>almost insurmountable obstacles of that campaign could not have been</p>
<p>overcome.  During it and in the siege of Petersburg he met with many</p>
<p>disappointments--on several occasions the shortcomings of generals,</p>
<p>when at the point of success, leading to wretched failures.  But so</p>
<p>far as he was concerned, the only apparent effect of these</p>
<p>discomfitures was to make him all the more determined to discharge</p>
<p>successfully the stupendous trust committed to his care, and to bring</p>
<p>into play the manifold resources of his well ordered military mind.</p>
<p>He guided every subordinate then, and in the last days of the</p>
<p>rebellion, with a fund of common sense and superiority of intellect,</p>
<p>which have left an impress so distinct as to exhibit his great</p>
<p>personality.  When his military history is analyzed after the lapse</p>
<p>of years, it will show, even more clearly than now, that during these</p>
<p>as well as in his previous campaigns he was the steadfast Centre</p>
<p>about and on which everything else turned.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<p>ORDERED TO GREENSBORO&#x27;, N. C.--MARCH TO THE DAN RIVER--ASSIGNED TO</p>
<p>THE COMMAND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI--LEAVING WASHINGTON--FLIGHT OF</p>
<p>GENERAL EARLY--MAXIMILIAN--MAKING DEMONSTRATIONS ON THE UPPER RIO</p>
<p>GRANDE--CONFEDERATES JOIN MAXIMILIAN--THE FRENCH INVASION OF MEXICO</p>
<p>AND ITS RELATIONS TO THE REBELLION--ASSISTING THE LIBERALS--</p>
<p>RESTORATION OF THE REPUBLIC.</p>
<p>The surrender at Appomattox put a stop to all military operations on</p>
<p>the part of General Grant&#x27;s forces, and the morning of April 10 my</p>
<p>cavalry began its march to Petersburg, the men anticipating that they</p>
<p>would soon be mustered out and returned to their homes.  At Nottoway</p>
<p>Court House I heard of the assassination of the President.  The first</p>
<p>news came to us the night after the dastardly deed, the telegraph</p>
<p>operator having taken it from the wires while in transmission to</p>
<p>General Meade.  The despatch ran that Mr. Lincoln had been, shot at</p>
<p>10 o&#x27;clock that morning at Willard&#x27;s Hotel, but as I could conceive</p>
<p>of nothing to take the President there I set the story down as a</p>
<p>canard, and went to bed without giving it further thought.  Next</p>
<p>morning, however, an official telegram confirmed the fact of the</p>
<p>assassination, though eliminating the distorted circumstances that</p>
<p>had been communicated the night before.</p>
<p>When we reached Petersburg my column was halted, and instructions</p>
<p>given me to march the cavalry and the Sixth Corps to Greensboro&#x27;,</p>
<p>North Carolina, for the purpose of aiding General Sherman (the</p>
<p>surrender of General Johnston having not yet been effected), so I</p>
<p>made the necessary preparations and moved on the 24th of April,</p>
<p>arriving at South Boston, on the Dan River, the 28th, the Sixth Corps</p>
<p>having reached Danville meanwhile.  At South Boston I received a</p>
<p>despatch from General Halleck, who immediately after Lee&#x27;s surrender</p>
<p>had been assigned to command at Richmond, informing me that General</p>
<p>Johnston had been brought to terms.  The necessity for going farther</p>
<p>south being thus obviated we retraced our steps to Petersburg, from</p>
<p>which place I proceeded by steamer to Washington, leaving, the</p>
<p>cavalry to be marched thither by easy stages.</p>
<p>The day after my arrival in Washington an important order was sent</p>
<p>me, accompanied by the following letter of instructions, transferring</p>
<p>me to a new field of operations:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>&quot;Washington, D.  C., May 17, 1865.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL : Under the orders relieving you from the command of the</p>
<p>Middle Military Division and assigning you to command west of the</p>
<p>Mississippi, you will proceed without delay to the West to arrange</p>
<p>all preliminaries for your new field of duties.</p>
<p>&quot;Your duty is to restore Texas, and that part of Louisiana held by</p>
<p>the enemy, to the Union in the shortest practicable time, in a way</p>
<p>most effectual for securing permanent peace.</p>
<p>&quot;To do this, you will be given all the troops that can be spared</p>
<p>by Major-General Canby, probably twenty-five thousand men of</p>
<p>all arms; the troops with Major-General J. J. Reynolds, in Arkansas,</p>
<p>say twelve thousand, Reynolds to command; the Fourth</p>
<p>Army Corps, now at Nashville, Tennessee, awaiting orders; and</p>
<p>the Twenty-Fifth Army Corps, now at City Point, Virginia, ready</p>
<p>to embark.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not wish to trammel you with instructions; I will state,</p>
<p>however, that if Smith holds out, without even an ostensible</p>
<p>government to receive orders from or to report to, he and his men are</p>
<p>not entitled to the considerations due to an acknowledged</p>
<p>belligerent.  Theirs are the conditions of outlaws, making war</p>
<p>against the only Government having an existence over the territory</p>
<p>where war is now being waged.</p>
<p>&quot;You may notify the rebel commander west of the Mississippi--holding</p>
<p>intercourse with him in person, or through such officers of the rank</p>
<p>of major-general as you may select--that he will be allowed to</p>
<p>surrender all his forces on the same terms as were accorded to Lee</p>
<p>and Johnston.  If he accedes, proceed to garrison the Red River as</p>
<p>high up as Shreveport, the seaboard at Galveston, Malagorda Bay,</p>
<p>Corpus Christi, and mouth of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>&quot;Place a strong force on the Rio Grande, holding it at least to a</p>
<p>point opposite Camargo, and above that if supplies can be procured.</p>
<p>&quot;In case of an active campaign (a hostile one) I think a heavy force</p>
<p>should be put on the Rio Grande as a first preliminary.  Troops for</p>
<p>this might be started at once.  The Twenty-Fifth Corps is now</p>
<p>available, and to it should be added a force of white troops, say</p>
<p>those now under Major-General Steele.</p>
<p>&quot;To be clear on this last point, I think the Rio Grande should be</p>
<p>strongly held, whether the forces in Texas surrender or not, and that</p>
<p>no time should be lost in getting troops there.  If war is to be</p>
<p>made, they will be in the right place; if Kirby Smith surrenders,</p>
<p>they will be on the line which is to be strongly garrisoned.</p>
<p>&quot;Should any force be necessary other than those designated, they can</p>
<p>be had by calling for them on Army Headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>&quot;Lieutenant-General.</p>
<p>&quot;To MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;United States Army.&quot;</p>
<p>On receipt of these instructions I called at once on General Grant,</p>
<p>to see if they were to be considered so pressing as to preclude my</p>
<p>remaining in Washington till after the Grand Review, which was fixed</p>
<p>for the 23d and 24th of May, for naturally I had a strong desire to</p>
<p>head my command on that great occasion.  But the General told me that</p>
<p>it was absolutely necessary to go at once to force the surrender of</p>
<p>the Confederates under Kirby Smith.  He also told me that the States</p>
<p>lately in rebellion would be embraced in two or three military</p>
<p>departments, the commanders of which would control civil affairs</p>
<p>until Congress took action about restoring them to the Union, since</p>
<p>that course would not only be economical and simple, but would give</p>
<p>the Southern people confidence, and encourage them to go to work,</p>
<p>instead of distracting them with politics.</p>
<p>At this same interview he informed me that there was an additional</p>
<p>motive in sending me to the new command, a motive not explained by</p>
<p>the instructions themselves, and went on to say that, as a matter of</p>
<p>fact, he looked upon the invasion of Mexico by Maximilian as a part</p>
<p>of the rebellion itself, because of the encouragement that invasion</p>
<p>had received from the Confederacy, and that our success in putting</p>
<p>down secession would never be complete till the French and Austrian</p>
<p>invaders were compelled to quit the territory of our sister republic.</p>
<p>With regard to this matter, though, he said it would be necessary for</p>
<p>me to act with great circumspection, since the Secretary of State,</p>
<p>Mr. Seward, was much opposed to the use of our troops along the</p>
<p>border in any active way that would be likely to involve us in a war</p>
<p>with European powers.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, my disappointment at not being permitted to</p>
<p>participate in the review had to be submitted to, and I left</p>
<p>Washington without an opportunity of seeing again in a body the men</p>
<p>who, while under my command, had gone through so many trials and</p>
<p>unremittingly pursued and, assailed the enemy, from the beginning of</p>
<p>the campaign of 1864 till the white flag came into their hands at</p>
<p>Appomattox Court House.</p>
<p>I went first to St.  Louis, and there took the steamboat for New</p>
<p>Orleans, and when near the mouth of the Red River received word from</p>
<p>General Canby that Kirby Smith had surrendered under terms similar to</p>
<p>those accorded Lee and Johnston.  But the surrender was not carried</p>
<p>out in good faith, particularly by the Texas troops, though this I</p>
<p>did not learn till some little time afterward when I was informed</p>
<p>that they had marched off to the interior of the State in several</p>
<p>organized bodies, carrying with them their camp equipage, arms,</p>
<p>ammunition, and even some artillery, with the ultimate purpose of</p>
<p>going to Mexico.  In consequence of this, and also because of the</p>
<p>desire of the Government to make a strong showing of force in Texas,</p>
<p>I decided to traverse the State with two columns of cavalry,</p>
<p>directing one to San Antonio under Merritt, the other to Houston</p>
<p>under Custer.  Both commands were to start from the Red River--</p>
<p>Shreveport and Alexandria--being the respective initial points--and</p>
<p>in organizing the columns, to the mounted force already on the Red</p>
<p>River were added several regiments of cavalry from the east bank of</p>
<p>the, Mississippi, and in a singular way one of these fell upon the</p>
<p>trail of my old antagonist, General Early.  While crossing the river</p>
<p>somewhere below Vicksburg some of the men noticed a suspicious</p>
<p>looking party being ferried over in a rowboat, behind which two</p>
<p>horses were swimming in tow.  Chase was given, and the horses, being</p>
<p>abandoned by the party, fell into the hands of our troopers, who,</p>
<p>however, failed to capture or identify the people in the boat.  As</p>
<p>subsequently ascertained, the men were companions of Early, who was</p>
<p>already across the Mississippi, hidden in the woods, on his way with</p>
<p>two or three of these followers to join the Confederates in Texas,</p>
<p>not having heard of Kirby Smith&#x27;s surrender.  A week or two later I</p>
<p>received a letter from Early describing the affair, and the capture</p>
<p>of the horses, for which he claimed pay, on the ground that they were</p>
<p>private property, because he had taken them in battle.  The letter</p>
<p>also said that any further pursuit of Early would be useless, as he</p>
<p>&quot;expected to be on the deep blue sea&quot; by the time his communication</p>
<p>reached me.  The unfortunate man was fleeing from imaginary dangers,</p>
<p>however, for striking his trail was purely accidental, and no effort</p>
<p>whatever was being made to arrest him personally.  Had this been</p>
<p>especially desired it might have been accomplished very readily just</p>
<p>after Lee&#x27;s surrender, for it was an open secret that Early was then</p>
<p>not far away, pretty badly disabled with rheumatism.</p>
<p>By the time the two columns were ready to set out for San Antonio and</p>
<p>Houston, General Frank Herron,--with one division of the Thirteenth</p>
<p>Corps, occupied Galveston, and another division under General Fred</p>
<p>Steele had gone to Brazos Santiago, to hold Brownsville and the line</p>
<p>of the Rio Grande, the object being to prevent, as far as possible,</p>
<p>the escaping Confederates from joining Maximilian.  With this purpose</p>
<p>in view, and not forgetting Grant&#x27;s conviction that the French</p>
<p>invasion of Mexico was linked with the rebellion, I asked for an</p>
<p>increase of force to send troops into Texas in fact, to concentrate</p>
<p>at available points in the State an army strong enough to move</p>
<p>against the invaders of Mexico if occasion demanded.  The Fourth and</p>
<p>Twenty-fifth army corps being ordered to report to me, accordingly, I</p>
<p>sent the Fourth Corps to Victoria and San Antonio, and the bulk of</p>
<p>the Twenty-fifth to Brownsville.  Then came the feeding and caring</p>
<p>for all these troops--a difficult matter--for those at Victoria and</p>
<p>San Antonio had to be provisioned overland from Indianola across the</p>
<p>&quot;hog-wallow prairie,&quot; while the supplies for the forces at</p>
<p>Brownsville and along the Rio Grande must come by way of Brazos</p>
<p>Santiago, from which point I was obliged to construct, with the labor</p>
<p>of the men, a railroad to Clarksville, a distance of about eighteen</p>
<p>miles.</p>
<p>The latter part of June I repaired to Brownsville myself to impress</p>
<p>the Imperialists, as much as possible, with the idea that we intended</p>
<p>hostilities, and took along my chief of scouts--Major Young--and four</p>
<p>of his most trusty men, whom I had had sent from Washington.  From</p>
<p>Brownsville I despatched all these men to important points in</p>
<p>northern Mexico, to glean information regarding the movements of the</p>
<p>Imperial forces, and also to gather intelligence about the ex-</p>
<p>Confederates who had crossed the Rio Grande.  On information</p>
<p>furnished by these scouts, I caused General Steele to make</p>
<p>demonstrations all along the lower Rio Grande, and at the same time</p>
<p>demanded the return of certain munitions of war that had been turned</p>
<p>over by ex-Confederates to the Imperial General (Mejia) commanding at</p>
<p>Matamoras.  These demands, backed up as they were by such a</p>
<p>formidable show of force created much agitation and demoralization</p>
<p>among the Imperial troops, and measures looking to the abandonment of</p>
<p>northern Mexico were forthwith adopted by those in authority--a</p>
<p>policy that would have resulted in the speedy evacuation of the</p>
<p>entire country by Maximilian, had not our Government weakened;</p>
<p>contenting itself with a few pieces of the contraband artillery</p>
<p>varnished over with the Imperial apologies.  A golden opportunity was</p>
<p>lost, for we had ample excuse for crossing the boundary, but Mr.</p>
<p>Seward being, as I have already stated, unalterably opposed to any</p>
<p>act likely to involve us in war, insisted on his course of</p>
<p>negotiation with Napoleon.</p>
<p>As the summer wore away, Maximilian, under Mr. Seward&#x27;s policy,</p>
<p>gained in strength till finally all the accessible sections of Mexico</p>
<p>were in his possession, and the Republic under President Juarez</p>
<p>almost succumbed.  Growing impatient at this, in the latter part of</p>
<p>September I decided to try again what virtue there might be in a</p>
<p>hostile demonstration, and selected the upper Rio Grande for the</p>
<p>scene of my attempt.  Merritt&#x27;s cavalry and the Fourth Corps still</p>
<p>being at San Antonio, I went to that place and reviewed these troops,</p>
<p>and having prepared them with some ostentation for a campaign, of</p>
<p>course it was bruited about that we were going to invade Mexico.</p>
<p>Then, escorted by a regiment of horse I proceeded hastily to Fort</p>
<p>Duncan, on the Rio Grande just opposite the Mexican town of Piedras</p>
<p>Negras.  Here I opened communication with President Juarez, through</p>
<p>one of his staff, taking care not to do this in the dark, and the</p>
<p>news, spreading like wildfire, the greatest significance was ascribed</p>
<p>to my action, it being reported most positively and with many</p>
<p>specific details that I was only awaiting the arrival of the troops,</p>
<p>then under marching orders at San Antonio, to cross the Rio Grande in</p>
<p>behalf of the Liberal cause.</p>
<p>Ample corroboration of the reports then circulated was found in my</p>
<p>inquiries regarding the quantity of forage we could depend upon</p>
<p>getting in Mexico, our arrangements for its purchase, and my sending</p>
<p>a pontoon train to Brownsville, together with which was cited the</p>
<p>renewed activity of the troops along the lower Rio Grande.  These</p>
<p>reports and demonstrations resulted in alarming the Imperialists so</p>
<p>much that they withdrew the French and Austrian soldiers from</p>
<p>Matamoras, and practically abandoned the whole of northern Mexico as</p>
<p>far down as Monterey, with the exception of Matamoras, where General</p>
<p>Mejia continued to hang on with a garrison of renegade Mexicans.</p>
<p>The abandonment of so much territory in northern Mexico encouraged</p>
<p>General Escobedo and other Liberal leaders to such a degree that they</p>
<p>collected a considerable army of their followers at Comargo, Mier,</p>
<p>and other points.  At the same time that unknown quantity, Cortinas,</p>
<p>suspended his free-booting for the nonce, and stoutly harassing</p>
<p>Matamoras, succeeded in keeping its Imperial garrison within the</p>
<p>fortifications.  Thus countenanced and stimulated, and largely</p>
<p>supplied with arms and ammunition, which we left at convenient places</p>
<p>on our side of the river to fall into their hands, the Liberals,</p>
<p>under General Escobedo--a man of much force of character--were</p>
<p>enabied in northern Mexico to place the affairs of the Republic on a</p>
<p>substantial basis.</p>
<p>But in the midst of what bade fair to cause a final withdrawal of the</p>
<p>foreigners, we were again checked by our Government, as a result of</p>
<p>representations of the French Minister at Washington.  In October, he</p>
<p>wrote to Mr. Seward that the United States troops on the Rio Grande</p>
<p>were acting &quot;in exact opposition to the repeated assurances Your</p>
<p>Excellency has given me concerning the desire of the Cabinet at</p>
<p>Washington to preserve the most strict neutrality in the events now</p>
<p>taking place in Mexico,&quot; and followed this statement with an emphatic</p>
<p>protest against our course.  Without any investigation whatever by</p>
<p>our State Department, this letter of the French Minister was</p>
<p>transmitted to me, accompanied by directions to preserve a strict</p>
<p>neutrality; so, of course, we were again debarred from anything like</p>
<p>active sympathy.</p>
<p>After this, it required the patience of Job to abide the slow and</p>
<p>poky methods of our State Department, and, in truth, it was often</p>
<p>very difficult to restrain officers and men from crossing the Rio</p>
<p>Grande with hostile purpose.  Within the knowledge of my troops,</p>
<p>there had gone on formerly the transfer of organized bodies of ex-</p>
<p>Confederates to Mexico, in aid of the Imperialists, and at this</p>
<p>period it was known that there was in preparation an immigration</p>
<p>scheme having in view the colonizing, at Cordova and one or two other</p>
<p>places, of all the discontented elements of the defunct Confederacy--</p>
<p>Generals Price, Magruder, Maury, and other high personages being</p>
<p>promoters of the enterprise, which Maximilian took to readily.  He</p>
<p>saw in it the possibilities of a staunch support to his throne, and</p>
<p>therefore not only sanctioned the project, but encouraged it with</p>
<p>large grants of land, inspirited the promoters with titles of</p>
<p>nobility, and, in addition, instituted a system of peonage, expecting</p>
<p>that the silver hook thus baited would be largely swallowed by the</p>
<p>Southern people.</p>
<p>The announcement of the scheme was followed by the appointment of</p>
<p>commissioners in each of the Southern States to send out emigrants;</p>
<p>but before any were deluded into starting, I made to General Grant a</p>
<p>report of what was going on, with the recommendation that measures be</p>
<p>taken, through our State Department, looking to the suppression of</p>
<p>the colony; but, as usual, nothing could be effected through that</p>
<p>channel; so, as an alternative, I published, in April, 1866, by</p>
<p>authority of General Grant, an order prohibiting the embarkation from</p>
<p>ports in Louisiana and Texas, for ports in Mexico, of any person</p>
<p>without a permit from my headquarters.  This dampened the ardor of</p>
<p>everybody in the Gulf States who had planned to go to Mexico; and</p>
<p>although the projectors of the Cordova Colonization Scheme--the name</p>
<p>by which it was known--secured a few innocents from other districts,</p>
<p>yet this set-back led ultimately to failure.</p>
<p>Among the Liberal leaders along the Rio Grande during this period</p>
<p>there sprang up many factional differences from various causes, some</p>
<p>personal, others political, and some, I regret to say, from downright</p>
<p>moral obliquity--as, for example, those between Cortinas and Canales-</p>
<p>-who, though generally hostile to the Imperialists, were freebooters</p>
<p>enough to take a shy at each other frequently, and now and then even</p>
<p>to join forces against Escobedo, unless we prevented them by coaxing</p>
<p>or threats.  A general who could unite these several factions was</p>
<p>therefore greatly needed, and on my return to New Orleans I so</p>
<p>telegraphed General Grant, and he, thinking General Caravajal (then</p>
<p>in Washington seeking aid for the Republic) would answer the purpose,</p>
<p>persuaded him to report to me in New Orleans.  Caravajal promptly</p>
<p>appeared, but he did not impress me very favorably.  He was old and</p>
<p>cranky, yet, as he seemed anxious to do his best, I sent him over to</p>
<p>Brownsville, with credentials, authorizing him to cross into Mexico,</p>
<p>and followed him myself by the next boat.  When I arrived in</p>
<p>Brownsville, matters in Matamoras had already reached a crisis.</p>
<p>General Mejia, feeling keenly the moral support we were giving the</p>
<p>Liberals, and hard pressed by the harassing attacks of Cortinas and</p>
<p>Canales, had abandoned the place, and Caravajal, because of his</p>
<p>credentials from our side, was in command, much to the</p>
<p>dissatisfaction of both those chiefs whose differences it was</p>
<p>intended he should reconcile.</p>
<p>The, day after I got to Brownsville I visited Matamoras, and had a</p>
<p>long interview with Caravajal.  The outcome of this meeting was, on</p>
<p>my part, a stronger conviction than ever that he was unsuitable, and</p>
<p>I feared that either Canales or Cortinas would get possession of the</p>
<p>city.  Caravajal made too many professions of what he would do--in</p>
<p>short, bragged too much--but as there was no help for the situation,</p>
<p>I made the best of it by trying to smooth down the ruffled feathers</p>
<p>of Canales and Cortinas.  In my interview with Caravajal I</p>
<p>recommended Major Young as a confidential man, whom he could rely</p>
<p>upon as a &quot;go-between &quot; for communicating with our people at</p>
<p>Brownsville, and whom he could trust to keep him informed of the</p>
<p>affairs of his own country as well.</p>
<p>A day or two afterward I recrossed the Gulf to New Orleans, and then,</p>
<p>being called from my headquarters to the interior of Texas, a</p>
<p>fortnight passed before I heard anything from Brownsville.  In the</p>
<p>meanwhile Major Young had come to New Orleans, and organized there a</p>
<p>band of men to act as a body-guard for Caravajal, the old wretch</p>
<p>having induced him to accept the proposition by representing that it</p>
<p>had my concurrence.  I at once condemned the whole business, but</p>
<p>Young, having been furnished with seven thousand dollars to recruit</p>
<p>the men and buy their arms, had already secured both, and was so</p>
<p>deeply involved in the transaction, he said, that he could not</p>
<p>withdraw without dishonor, and with tears in his eyes he besought me</p>
<p>to help him.  He told me he had entered upon the adventure in the</p>
<p>firm belief that I would countenance it; that the men and their</p>
<p>equipment were on his hands; that he must make good his word at all</p>
<p>hazards; and that while I need not approve, yet I must go far enough</p>
<p>to consent to the departure of the men, and to loan him the money</p>
<p>necessary to provision his party and hire a schooner to carry them to</p>
<p>Brazos.  It was hard in deed to resist the appeals of this man, who</p>
<p>had served me so long and so well, and the result of his pleading was</p>
<p>that I gave him permission to sail, and also loaned him the sum asked</p>
<p>for; but I have never ceased to regret my consent, for misfortune</p>
<p>fell upon the enterprise almost from its inception.</p>
<p>By the time the party got across the Gulf and over to Brownsville,</p>
<p>Caravajal had been deposed by Canales, and the latter would not</p>
<p>accept their services.  This left Young with about fifty men to whom</p>
<p>he was accountable, and as he had no money to procure them</p>
<p>subsistence, they were in a bad fix.  The only thing left to do was</p>
<p>to tender their services to General Escobedo, and with this in view</p>
<p>the party set out to reach the General&#x27;s camp, marching up the Rio</p>
<p>Grande on the American side, intending to cross near Ringgold Bar</p>
<p>racks.  In advance of them, however, had spread far and wide the</p>
<p>tidings of who they were, what they proposed to do, and where they</p>
<p>were going, and before they could cross into Mexico they were</p>
<p>attacked by a party of ex-Confederates and  renegade Mexican</p>
<p>rancheros.  Being on American soil, Young forbade his men to return</p>
<p>the fire, and bent all his efforts to getting them over the river;</p>
<p>but in this attempt they were broken up, and became completely</p>
<p>demoralized.  A number of the men were drowned while swimming the</p>
<p>river, Young himself was shot and killed, a few were captured, and</p>
<p>those who escaped--about twenty in all--finally joined Escobedo, but</p>
<p>in such a  plight as to be of little use.  With this distressing</p>
<p>affair came to an end pretty much all open participation of American</p>
<p>sympathizers with the Liberal cause, but the moral support afforded</p>
<p>by the presence of our forces continued, and this was frequently</p>
<p>supplemented with material aid in the shape of munitions of war,</p>
<p>which we liberally supplied, though constrained to do so by the most</p>
<p>secret methods.</p>
<p>The term of office of Juarez as President of the Mexican Republic</p>
<p>expired in December, 1865, but to meet existing exigencies he had</p>
<p>continued himself in office by proclamation, a course rendered</p>
<p>necessary by the fact that no elections could be held on account of</p>
<p>the Imperial occupation of most of the country.  The official who, by</p>
<p>the Mexican Constitution, is designated for the succession in such an</p>
<p>emergency, is the President of the Supreme Court, and the person then</p>
<p>eligible under this provision was General Ortega, but in the interest</p>
<p>of the Imperialists he had absented himself from Mexico, hence the</p>
<p>patriotic course of Juarez in continuing himself at the head of</p>
<p>affairs was a necessity of the situation.  This action of the</p>
<p>President gave the Imperialists little concern at first, but with the</p>
<p>revival of the Liberal cause they availed themselves of every means</p>
<p>to divide its supporters, and Ortega, who had been lying low in the</p>
<p>United States, now came forward to claim the Presidency.  Though</p>
<p>ridiculously late for such a step, his first act was to issue a</p>
<p>manifesto protesting against the assumption of the executive</p>
<p>authority by Juarez.  The protest had little effect, however, and his</p>
<p>next proceeding was to come to New Orleans, get into correspondence</p>
<p>with other disaffected Mexicans, and thus perfect his plans.  When he</p>
<p>thought his intrigue ripe enough for action, he sailed for Brazos,</p>
<p>intending to cross the Rio Grande and assert his claims with arms.</p>
<p>While he was scheming in New Orleans, however, I had learned what he</p>
<p>was up to, and in advance of his departure had sent instructions to</p>
<p>have him arrested on American soil.  Colonel Sedgwick, commanding at</p>
<p>Brownsville, was now temporary master of Matamoras also, by reason of</p>
<p>having stationed some American troops there for the protection of</p>
<p>neutral merchants, so when Ortega appeared at Brazos, Sedgwick</p>
<p>quietly arrested him and held him till the city of Matamoras was</p>
<p>turned over to General Escobedo, the authorized representative of</p>
<p>Juarez; then Escobedo took charge, of Ortega, and with ease prevented</p>
<p>his further machinations.</p>
<p>During the winter and spring of 1866 we continued covertly supplying</p>
<p>arms and ammunition to the Liberals--sending as many as 30,000</p>
<p>muskets from Baton Rouge Arsenal alone--and by mid-summer Juarez,</p>
<p>having organized a pretty good sized army, was in possession of the</p>
<p>whole line of the Rio Grande, and, in fact, of nearly the whole of</p>
<p>Mexico down to San Louis Potosi.  Then thick and fast came rumors</p>
<p>pointing to the tottering condition of Maximilian&#x27;s Empire-first,</p>
<p>that Orizaba and Vera Cruz were being fortified; then, that the</p>
<p>French were to be withdrawn; and later came the intelligence that the</p>
<p>Empress Carlotta had gone home to beg assistance from Napoleon, the</p>
<p>author of all of her husband&#x27;s troubles.  But the situation forced</p>
<p>Napoleon to turn a deaf ear to Carlotta&#x27;s prayers.  The brokenhearted</p>
<p>woman besought him on her knees, but his fear of losing an army made</p>
<p>all pleadings vain.  In fact, as I ascertained by the following</p>
<p>cablegram which came into my hands, Napoleon&#x27;s instructions for the</p>
<p>French evacuation were in Mexico at the very time of this pathetic</p>
<p>scene between him and Carlotta.  The despatch was in cipher when I</p>
<p>received it, but was translated by the telegraph operator at my</p>
<p>headquarters, who long before had mastered the key of the French</p>
<p>cipher:</p>
<p>&quot;PARIS, January 10, 1867.  FRENCH CONSUL, New Orleans, La.</p>
<p>&quot;To GENERAL CASTELNAU, at Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;Received your despatch of the 9th December.  Do not compel the</p>
<p>Emperor to abdicate, but do not delay the departure of the troops;</p>
<p>bring back all those who will not remain there.  Most of the fleet</p>
<p>has left.</p>
<p>&quot;NAPOLEON.&quot;</p>
<p>This meant the immediate withdrawal of the French.  The rest of the</p>
<p>story--which has necessarily been but in outline--is soon told.</p>
<p>Maximilian, though deserted, determined to hold out to the last, and</p>
<p>with the aid of disloyal Mexicans stuck to his cause till the spring.</p>
<p>When taken prisoner at Queretaro, he was tried and executed under</p>
<p>circumstances that are well known.  From promptings of humanity</p>
<p>Secretary Seward tried hard to save the Imperial prisoner, but</p>
<p>without success.  The Secretary&#x27;s plea for mercy was sent through me</p>
<p>at New Orleans, and to make speed I hired a steamer to proceed with</p>
<p>it across the Gulf to Tampico.  The document was carried by Sergeant</p>
<p>White, one of my scouts, who crossed the country from Tampico, and</p>
<p>delivered it to Escobedo at Queretaro; but Mr. Seward&#x27;s</p>
<p>representations were without avail--refused probably because little</p>
<p>mercy had been shown certain Liberal leaders unfortunate enough to</p>
<p>fall into Maximilian&#x27;s hands during the prosperous days of his</p>
<p>Empire.</p>
<p>At the close of our war there was little hope for the Republic of</p>
<p>Mexico.  Indeed, till our troops were concentrated on the Rio Grande</p>
<p>there was none.  Our appearance in such force along the border</p>
<p>permitted the Liberal leaders, refugees from their homes, to</p>
<p>establish rendezvous whence they could promulgate their plans in</p>
<p>safety, while the countenance thus given the cause, when hope was</p>
<p>well-nigh gone, incited the Mexican people to renewed resistance.</p>
<p>Beginning again with very scant means, for they had lost about all,</p>
<p>the Liberals saw their cause, under the influence of such significant</p>
<p>and powerful backing, progress and steadily grow so strong that</p>
<p>within two years Imperialism had received its death-blow.  I doubt</p>
<p>very much whether such, results could have been achieved without the</p>
<p>presence of an American army on the Rio Grande, which, be it</p>
<p>remembered, was sent there because, in General Grant&#x27;s words, the</p>
<p>French invasion of Mexico was so closely related to the rebellion as</p>
<p>to be essentially a part of it.</p>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<p>A. J. HAMILTON APPOINTED PROVISIONAL GOVERNOR OF TEXAS--ASSEMBLES A</p>
<p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION--THE TEXANS DISSATISFIED--LAWLESSNESS--</p>
<p>OPPRESSIVE LEGISLATION--EX-CONFEDERATES CONTROLLING LOUISIANA--A</p>
<p>CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION--THE MEETING SUPPRESSED--A BLOODY RIOT--MY</p>
<p>REPORTS OF THE MASSACRE--PORTIONS SUPPRESSED BY PRESIDENT JOHNSON--</p>
<p>SUSTAINED BY A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE--THE RECONSTRUCTION LAWS.</p>
<p>Although in 1865-66 much of my attention was directed to</p>
<p>international matters along the Rio Grande, the civil affairs of</p>
<p>Texas and Louisiana required a certain amount of military supervision</p>
<p>also in the absence of regularly established civil authority.  At the</p>
<p>time of Kirby Smith&#x27;s surrender the National Government had</p>
<p>formulated no plan with regard to these or the other States lately in</p>
<p>rebellion, though a provisional Government had been set up in</p>
<p>Louisiana as early as 1864.  In consequence of this lack of system,</p>
<p>Governor Pendleton Murray, of Texas, who was elected under</p>
<p>Confederate rule, continued to discharge the duties of Governor till</p>
<p>President Johnson, on June 17, in harmony with his amnesty</p>
<p>proclamation of May 29, 1865, appointed A. J. Hamilton provisional</p>
<p>Governor.  Hamilton was empowered by the President to call a</p>
<p>Constitutional convention, the delegates to which were to be elected,</p>
<p>under certain prescribed qualifications, for the purpose of</p>
<p>organizing the political affairs of the State, the Governor to be</p>
<p>guided by instructions similar to those given the provisional</p>
<p>Governor of North Carolina (W. W. Holden), when appointed in May.</p>
<p>The convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among</p>
<p>the people of Texas.  They had assumed that affairs were to go on as</p>
<p>of old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place</p>
<p>under the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had</p>
<p>taken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize</p>
<p>the election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction</p>
<p>as to who should be entitled to vote.  Thus encouraged, the element</p>
<p>but lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the</p>
<p>State to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal</p>
<p>Government; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions,</p>
<p>since his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in</p>
<p>question, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great</p>
<p>as to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.  The</p>
<p>provisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray,</p>
<p>prohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after</p>
<p>called, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by</p>
<p>voters who could take the amnesty-oath.  The proclamation convening</p>
<p>this assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in</p>
<p>governing the State until its affairs were satisfactorily</p>
<p>reorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the</p>
<p>Judiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of</p>
<p>county officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.  As this</p>
<p>action of Hamilton&#x27;s disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty</p>
<p>oath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with</p>
<p>pronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he</p>
<p>had on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people,</p>
<p>particularly as in the transition state of society just after the</p>
<p>close of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented</p>
<p>itself chiefly on the freedmen.  It was greatly feared that political</p>
<p>rights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was</p>
<p>generally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race</p>
<p>war unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of</p>
<p>subjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of</p>
<p>the State.</p>
<p>Hamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb</p>
<p>this terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could</p>
<p>accomplish little without military aid.  As department commander, I</p>
<p>was required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as</p>
<p>these requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the</p>
<p>result was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of</p>
<p>troops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.  By such</p>
<p>disposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the</p>
<p>administration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration</p>
<p>of J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an</p>
<p>authorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called</p>
<p>together, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.</p>
<p>One of Governor Throckmorton&#x27;s first acts was to ask the withdrawal</p>
<p>or non-interference of the military.  This was not all granted, but</p>
<p>under his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of</p>
<p>August, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with</p>
<p>the unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than</p>
<p>enough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the</p>
<p>beginning of Hamilton&#x27;s administration.  Oppressive legislation in</p>
<p>the shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed,</p>
<p>developing a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on</p>
<p>the part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder</p>
<p>ensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least,</p>
<p>continued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction</p>
<p>Acts, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>In the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the</p>
<p>loyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as</p>
<p>early as 1864.  This was effected under encouragement given by</p>
<p>President Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention,</p>
<p>which met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.  The</p>
<p>constitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in</p>
<p>September, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of</p>
<p>the State.</p>
<p>The government provided under this constitution being looked upon as</p>
<p>provisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the</p>
<p>returned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President&#x27;s</p>
<p>amnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.  The</p>
<p>Legislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and</p>
<p>municipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August,</p>
<p>1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding</p>
<p>civil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded</p>
<p>States, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative</p>
<p>legislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant</p>
<p>wrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote</p>
<p>parishes to numbers of outrages and murders.</p>
<p>To remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by</p>
<p>those who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the</p>
<p>constitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling</p>
<p>the convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for</p>
<p>reconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its</p>
<p>president.  Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of</p>
<p>this convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a</p>
<p>necessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation</p>
<p>was issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.</p>
<p>Mayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked</p>
<p>upon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the</p>
<p>convention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed</p>
<p>that efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the</p>
<p>meeting.  A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and</p>
<p>wounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.</p>
<p>I happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from</p>
<p>Texas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.  On my</p>
<p>way up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of</p>
<p>July 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving</p>
<p>the details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing</p>
<p>me that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior</p>
<p>military officer present, had assumed control of the municipal</p>
<p>government.  On reaching the city I made an investigation, and that</p>
<p>night sent the following report of the affair:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF,</p>
<p>&quot;NEW ORLEANS, LA., Aug.  1, 1866.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL U. S. GRANT:</p>
<p>&quot;You are doubtless aware of the serious riot which occurred in this</p>
<p>city on the 30th.  A political body, styling themselves the</p>
<p>Convention of 1864, met on the 30th, for, as it is alleged, the</p>
<p>purpose of remodeling the present constitution of the State.  The</p>
<p>leaders were political agitators and revolutionary men, and the</p>
<p>action of the convention was liable to produce breaches of the public</p>
<p>peace.  I had made up my mind to arrest the head men, if the</p>
<p>proceedings of the convention were calculated to disturb the</p>
<p>tranquility of the Department; but I had no cause for action until</p>
<p>they committed the overt act.  In the meantime official duty called</p>
<p>me to Texas, and the mayor of the city, during my absence suppressed</p>
<p>the convention by the use of the police force, and in so doing</p>
<p>attacked the members of the convention, and a party of two hundred</p>
<p>negroes, with fire-arms, clubs, and knives, in a manner so</p>
<p>unnecessary and atrocious as to compel me to say that it was murder.</p>
<p>About forty whites and blacks were thus killed, and about one hundred</p>
<p>and sixty wounded.  Everything is now quiet, but I deem it best to</p>
<p>maintain a military supremacy in the city for a few days, until the</p>
<p>affair is fully investigated.  I believe the sentiment of the general</p>
<p>community is great regret at this unnecessary cruelty, and that the</p>
<p>police could have made any arrest they saw fit without sacrificing</p>
<p>lives.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General Commanding.&quot;</p>
<p>On receiving the telegram, General.  Grant immediately submitted.  it</p>
<p>to the President.  Much clamor being made at the North for the</p>
<p>publication of the despatch, Mr. Johnson pretended to give it to the</p>
<p>newspapers.  It appeared in the issues of August 4, but with this</p>
<p>paragraph omitted, viz.:</p>
<p>&quot;I had made up my mind to arrest the head men, if the proceedings of</p>
<p>the convention were calculated to disturb the tranquility of the</p>
<p>Department, but I had no cause for action until they committed the</p>
<p>overt act.  In the mean time official duty called me to Texas, and</p>
<p>the mayor of the city, during my absence, suppressed the convention</p>
<p>by the use of the police force, and in so doing attacked the members</p>
<p>of the convention, and a party of two hundred negroes, with fire-</p>
<p>arms, clubs, and knives, in a manner so unnecessary and atrocious as</p>
<p>to compel me to say it was murder.&quot;</p>
<p>Against this garbling of my report-done by the President&#x27;s own order-</p>
<p>I strongly demurred; and this emphatic protest marks the beginning of</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson&#x27;s well-known personal hostility toward me.  In the mean</p>
<p>time I received (on August 3) the following despatch from General</p>
<p>Grant approving my course:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>&quot;WAR DEPT., WASHINGTON, D.  C., &quot;August 3, 1866--5 p.m.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Mil. Div. of the Gulf,</p>
<p>&quot;New Orleans, La.</p>
<p>&quot;Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to</p>
<p>preserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to</p>
<p>act, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.  Lose no</p>
<p>time in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot,</p>
<p>and the facts which occurred.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>&quot;Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>In obedience to the President&#x27;s directions, My report of August 1 was</p>
<p>followed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it</p>
<p>tells the whole story of the riot :</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF,</p>
<p>&quot;NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.</p>
<p>&quot;His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON,</p>
<p>&quot;President United States</p>
<p>&quot;I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of</p>
<p>August 4.  A very large number of colored people marched in</p>
<p>procession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were</p>
<p>addressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor</p>
<p>Hahn, and others.  The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language</p>
<p>and sentiment.  The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn,</p>
<p>were characterized by moderation.  I have not given you the words of</p>
<p>Dostie&#x27;s speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I</p>
<p>have learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.</p>
<p>&quot;The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30),</p>
<p>the timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the</p>
<p>general public was ominous of trouble.  I think there were about</p>
<p>twenty-six (26) members present.  In front of the Mechanics</p>
<p>Institute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some</p>
<p>colored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty</p>
<p>(20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one</p>
<p>hundred and fifty (150).  Among those outside and inside there might</p>
<p>have been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.</p>
<p>&quot;About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one</p>
<p>hundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and</p>
<p>across Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.</p>
<p>These men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs</p>
<p>in addition.  While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.  There were</p>
<p>many spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the</p>
<p>procession unfriendly.  A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to</p>
<p>state, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored</p>
<p>man in the procession.  This led to other shots and a rush after the</p>
<p>procession.  On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some</p>
<p>throwing of brickbats by both sides.  The police, who had been held</p>
<p>well in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.  The</p>
<p>procession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or</p>
<p>eight (8) remaining outside.  A row occurred between a policeman and</p>
<p>one of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the</p>
<p>parties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through</p>
<p>the windows by the policemen.  This had been going on for a short</p>
<p>time, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the</p>
<p>Institute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into</p>
<p>the building.</p>
<p>&quot;From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the</p>
<p>building, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the</p>
<p>audience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired,</p>
<p>and those inside barricaded the doors.  The door was broken in, and</p>
<p>the firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people</p>
<p>either escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the</p>
<p>policemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the</p>
<p>circle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again</p>
<p>fired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.  Many of</p>
<p>those wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and</p>
<p>not wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.  The</p>
<p>wounded were stabbed while lying on the grgund, and their heads</p>
<p>beaten with brickbats.  In the yard of the building, whither some of</p>
<p>the colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they</p>
<p>were fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.  Some were killed</p>
<p>and wounded several squares from the scene.  Members of the</p>
<p>convention were wounded by the police while in their hands as</p>
<p>prisoners, some of them mortally.</p>
<p>&quot;The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of</p>
<p>this Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic</p>
<p>feeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of</p>
<p>the present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force,</p>
<p>selected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.</p>
<p>People of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the</p>
<p>Mayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his</p>
<p>police force.  I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens</p>
<p>on this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of</p>
<p>confidence in Mayor Monroe.  Ever since the intimation of this last</p>
<p>convention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city</p>
<p>papers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad</p>
<p>men.  As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken</p>
<p>up, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.</p>
<p>&quot;It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a</p>
<p>great many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has</p>
<p>so precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the</p>
<p>status of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in</p>
<p>constant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and</p>
<p>property, and have justice in the courts.  If this matter is</p>
<p>permitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution</p>
<p>of those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the</p>
<p>same kind, not only here, but in other places.  No steps have as yet</p>
<p>been taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were</p>
<p>engaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such</p>
<p>cruelties.  The members of the convention have been indicted by the</p>
<p>grand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.  As to</p>
<p>whether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the</p>
<p>guilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion,</p>
<p>unequivocally, that they cannot.  Judge Abell, whose course I have</p>
<p>closely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most</p>
<p>dangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.</p>
<p>The leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others--</p>
<p>have been political agitators, and are bad men.  I regret to say that</p>
<p>the course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during</p>
<p>the late trouble he has shown very little of the man.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General Commanding.&quot;</p>
<p>Subsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the</p>
<p>riot, taking a great deal of testimony.  The commission substantially</p>
<p>confirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later</p>
<p>there was an investigation by a select committee of the House of</p>
<p>Representatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of</p>
<p>Ohio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, were the members.  The majority report of the committee</p>
<p>also corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing</p>
<p>occurrence.  The committee likewise called attention to a violent</p>
<p>speech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging</p>
<p>the origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech</p>
<p>that &quot;it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling,</p>
<p>without pretext or foundation in fact.&quot;  A list of the killed and</p>
<p>wounded was embraced in the committee&#x27;s report, and among other</p>
<p>conclusions reached were the following: &quot;That the meeting of July 30</p>
<p>was a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and</p>
<p>with intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....</p>
<p>There has been no occasion during our National history when a riot</p>
<p>has occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a</p>
<p>massacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New</p>
<p>Orleans on the 30th of July last.  This riotous attack upon the</p>
<p>convention, with its terrible results of massacre and murder, was not</p>
<p>an accident.  It was the determined purpose of the mayor of the city</p>
<p>of New Orleans to break up this convention by armed force.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement is also made, that, &quot;He [the President] knew that</p>
<p>&#x27;rebels&#x27; and &#x27;thugs&#x27; and disloyal men had controlled the election of</p>
<p>Mayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.&quot;</p>
<p>The committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and</p>
<p>recommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government</p>
<p>therein; the report concluding that &quot;in the meantime the safety of</p>
<p>all Union men within the State demands that such government be formed</p>
<p>for their protection, for the well being of the nation and the</p>
<p>permanent peace of the Republic.&quot;</p>
<p>The New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and</p>
<p>other reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to</p>
<p>President Johnson&#x27;s policy of reconstruction, a policy resting</p>
<p>exclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it</p>
<p>was made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to</p>
<p>rehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit</p>
<p>from those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the</p>
<p>slightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the</p>
<p>emancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who</p>
<p>had remained loyal in the war.</p>
<p>In December, 1866, Congress took hold of the subject with such vigor</p>
<p>as to promise relief from all these perplexing disorders, and, after</p>
<p>much investigation and a great deal of debate, there resulted the so-</p>
<p>called &quot;Reconstruction Laws,&quot; which, for a clear understanding of the</p>
<p>powers conferred on the military commanders, I deem best to append in</p>
<p>full:</p>
<p>AN ACT to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>WHEREAS, no legal State governments or adequate protection for life</p>
<p>or property now exist in the rebel States of Virginia, North</p>
<p>Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana,</p>
<p>Florida, Texas, and Arkansas; and whereas, it is necessary that peace</p>
<p>and good order should be enforced in said States until loyal and</p>
<p>republican State governments can be legally established; therefore,</p>
<p>BE IT ENACTED by the Senate and House of Representatives of the</p>
<p>United States of America in Congress assembled, That said rebel</p>
<p>States shall be divided into military districts and made subject to</p>
<p>the military authority of the United States as hereinafter</p>
<p>prescribed; and for that purpose Virginia shall constitute the first</p>
<p>district; North Carolina and South Carolina, the second district;</p>
<p>Georgia, Alabama, and Florida, the third district; Mississippi and</p>
<p>Arkansas, the fourth district; and Louisiana and Texas, the fifth</p>
<p>district.</p>
<p>SEC. 2.  And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of the</p>
<p>President to assign to the command of each of said districts an</p>
<p>officer of the army not below the rank of brigadier-general, and to</p>
<p>detail a sufficient military force to enable such officer to perform</p>
<p>his duties and enforce his authority within the district to which he</p>
<p>is assigned.</p>
<p>SEC. 3. And be it further enacted, That it shall be the duty of each</p>
<p>officer assigned as aforesaid to protect all persons in their rights</p>
<p>of person and property, to suppress insurrection, disorder, and</p>
<p>violence, and to punish, or cause to be punished, all disturbers of</p>
<p>the public peace and criminals, and to this end he may allow local</p>
<p>civil tribunals to take jurisdiction of and to try offenders, or,</p>
<p>when in his judgment it may be necessary for the trial of offenders,</p>
<p>he shall have power to organize military commissions or tribunals for</p>
<p>that purpose, and all interference, under cover of State authority,</p>
<p>with the exercise of military authority under this act, shall be null</p>
<p>and void.</p>
<p>SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, That all persons put under</p>
<p>military arrest by virtue of this act shall be tried without</p>
<p>unnecessary delay, and no cruel or unjust punishment shall be</p>
<p>inflicted; and no sentence of any military commission or tribunal</p>
<p>hereby authorized affecting the life or liberty of any person, shall</p>
<p>be executed untill it is approved by the officer in command of the</p>
<p>district; and the laws and regulations for the government of the army</p>
<p>shall not be affected by this act except in so far as they conflict</p>
<p>with its provisions: Provided, That no sentence of death, under the</p>
<p>provisions of this act, shall be carried into effect without the</p>
<p>approval of the President.</p>
<p>SEC. 5. And be it further enacted, That when the people of any one of</p>
<p>said rebel States shall have formed a constitution of government in</p>
<p>conformity with the Constitution of the United States in all</p>
<p>respects, framed by a convention of delegates elected by the male</p>
<p>citizens of said State twenty-one years old and upward, of whatever</p>
<p>race, color, or previous condition, who have been resident in said</p>
<p>State for one year previous to the day of such election, except such</p>
<p>as may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion, or for</p>
<p>felony at common law; and when such constitution shall provide that</p>
<p>the elective franchise shall be enjoyed by all such persons as have</p>
<p>the qualifications herein stated for electors of delegates; and when</p>
<p>such constitution shall be ratified by a majority of the persons</p>
<p>voting on the question of ratification who are qualified as electors</p>
<p>for delegates, and when such constitution shall have been submitted</p>
<p>to Congress for examination and approval, and Congress shall have</p>
<p>approved the same; and when said State, by a vote of its legislature</p>
<p>elected under said constitution, shall have adopted the amendment to</p>
<p>the Constitution of the United States proposed by the Thirty-ninth</p>
<p>Congress, and known as article fourteen; and when said article shall</p>
<p>have become a part of the Constitution of the United States, said</p>
<p>State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress, and</p>
<p>senators and representatives shall be admitted therefrom on their</p>
<p>taking the oath prescribed by law; and then and thereafter the</p>
<p>preceding sections of this act shall be inoperative in said State:</p>
<p>Provided, That no person excluded from the privilege of holding</p>
<p>office by said proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United</p>
<p>States shall be eligible to election as a member of the convention to</p>
<p>frame a constitution for any of said rebel States, nor shall any such</p>
<p>person vote for members of such convention.</p>
<p>SEC. 6. And be it further enacted, That until the people of said</p>
<p>rebel States shall be by law admitted to representation in the</p>
<p>Congress of the United States, any civil government which may exist</p>
<p>therein shall be deemed provisional only, and in all respects subject</p>
<p>to the paramount authority of the United States at any time to</p>
<p>abolish, modify, control, or supersede the same; and in all elections</p>
<p>to any office under such provisional governments all persons shall be</p>
<p>entitled to vote, and none others, who are entitled to vote under the</p>
<p>fifth section of this act; and no person shall be eligible to any</p>
<p>office under any such provisional governments who would be</p>
<p>disqualified from holding office under the provisions of the third</p>
<p>article of said constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>SCHUYLER COLFAX,</p>
<p>Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>LAFAYETTE S. FOSTER,</p>
<p>President of the Senate pro tempore.</p>
<p>AN ACT supplementary to an act entitled &quot;An act to provide for the</p>
<p>more efficient government of the rebel States,&quot; passed March second,</p>
<p>eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, and to facilitate restoration.</p>
<p>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the</p>
<p>United States of America in Congress assembled, That before the first</p>
<p>day of September, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, the commanding</p>
<p>general in each district defined by an act entitled &quot;An act to</p>
<p>provide for the more efficient government of the rebel States,&quot;</p>
<p>passed March second, eighteen hundred and sixty-seven, shall cause a</p>
<p>registration to be made of the male citizens of the United States,</p>
<p>twenty-one years of age and upwards, resident in each county or</p>
<p>parish in the State or States included in his district, which</p>
<p>registration shall include only those persons who are qualified to</p>
<p>vote for delegates by the act aforesaid, and who shall have taken and</p>
<p>subscribed the following oath or affirmation : &quot; I,------, do</p>
<p>solemnly swear (or affirm), in the presence of the Almighty God, that</p>
<p>I am a citizen of the State of ---------; that I have resided in said</p>
<p>State for----- months next preceding this day, and now reside in the</p>
<p>county of -------, or the parish of --------, in said State, (as the</p>
<p>case may be); that I am twenty-one years old; that I have not been</p>
<p>disfranchised for participation in any rebellion or civil war against</p>
<p>the United States, nor for felony committed against the laws of any</p>
<p>State or of the United States; that I have never been a member of any</p>
<p>State Legislature, nor held any executive or judicial office in any</p>
<p>State, and afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against</p>
<p>the United States, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof;</p>
<p>that I have never taken an oath as a member of Congress of the United</p>
<p>States, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any</p>
<p>State Legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any</p>
<p>State, to support the constitution of the United States, and</p>
<p>afterwards engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United</p>
<p>States or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof; that I will</p>
<p>faithfully support the Constitution and obey the laws of the United</p>
<p>States, and will, to the best of my ability, encourage others so to</p>
<p>do: so help me God.&quot;; which oath or affirmation may be administered</p>
<p>by any registering officer.</p>
<p>SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That after the completion of the</p>
<p>registration hereby provided for in any State, at such time and</p>
<p>places therein as the commanding general shall appoint and direct, of</p>
<p>which at least thirty days&#x27; public notice shall be given, an election</p>
<p>shall be held of delegates to a convention for the purpose of</p>
<p>establishing a constitution and civil government for such State loyal</p>
<p>to the Union, said convention in each State, except Virginia, to</p>
<p>consist of the same number of members as the most numerous branch of</p>
<p>the State Legislature of such State in the year eighteen hundred and</p>
<p>sixty, to be apportioned among the several districts, counties, or</p>
<p>parishes of such State by the commanding general, giving each</p>
<p>representation in the ratio of voters registered as aforesaid as</p>

<p>CHAPTER X1.</p>
<p>PASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT&#x27;S VETO--PLACED</p>
<p>IN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY</p>
<p>REASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND TEXAS--REMOVAL OF</p>
<p>GOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND</p>
<p>OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.</p>
<p>The first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and</p>
<p>though vetoed by the President, such was the unanimity of loyal</p>
<p>sentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill became</p>
<p>a law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress.</p>
<p>March the 11th this law was published in General Orders No . 10, from</p>
<p>the Headquarters of the Army, the same order assigning certain</p>
<p>officers to take charge of the five military districts into which the</p>
<p>States lately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the</p>
<p>commander of the Fifth Military District, which embraced Louisiana</p>
<p>and Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion of my command</p>
<p>since the close of the war.</p>
<p>Between the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana</p>
<p>Legislature, then in special session, had rejected a proposed repeal</p>
<p>of an Act it had previously passed providing for an election of</p>
<p>certain municipal officers in New Orleans.  This election was set for</p>
<p>March 11, but the mayor and the chief of police, together with</p>
<p>General Mower, commanding the troops in the city, having expressed to</p>
<p>me personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed by</p>
<p>the election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the</p>
<p>district, assuming the authority which the Act conferred on district</p>
<p>commanders, declared that the election should not take place; that no</p>
<p>polls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter</p>
<p>would stand postponed till the district commander should be</p>
<p>appointed, or special instructions be had.  This, my first official</p>
<p>act under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the</p>
<p>course of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give</p>
<p>unequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of</p>
<p>Congress.</p>
<p>A copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with</p>
<p>my assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly</p>
<p>assumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an</p>
<p>order wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the</p>
<p>district to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the</p>
<p>sixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified,</p>
<p>superseded, or abolished.  I also announced that no removals from</p>
<p>office would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the</p>
<p>provisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful</p>
<p>delays should necessitate a change, and added: &quot;Pending the</p>
<p>reorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little</p>
<p>disturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the</p>
<p>provisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of</p>
<p>Congress and its successful execution, but this condition is</p>
<p>dependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the</p>
<p>length of time required for reorganization.&quot;</p>
<p>Under these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former</p>
<p>designations as military districts, the officers in command</p>
<p>exercising their military powers as heretofore.  In addition, these</p>
<p>officers were to carry out in their respective commands all</p>
<p>provisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of</p>
<p>the district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment</p>
<p>to office.</p>
<p>In the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have</p>
<p>heretofore noted, had been vetoed.  On the very day of the veto,</p>
<p>however, despite the President&#x27;s adverse action, it passed each House</p>
<p>of Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it</p>
<p>the effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of</p>
<p>reconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by</p>
<p>the people of the country.  It was, therefore, my determination to</p>
<p>see to the law&#x27;s zealous execution in my district, though I felt</p>
<p>certain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every</p>
<p>means in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal</p>
<p>hostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but</p>
<p>to obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.</p>
<p>Having come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my</p>
<p>guidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional</p>
<p>State governments, and though many appeals were made to have me</p>
<p>rescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some</p>
<p>presupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that</p>
<p>I would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of</p>
<p>absolute necessity.  The same policy was announced also in reference</p>
<p>to municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action</p>
<p>of the local officers did not conflict with the law.</p>
<p>In a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in</p>
<p>municipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent</p>
<p>that several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and</p>
<p>commission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from</p>
<p>office the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District</p>
<p>Court, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S.</p>
<p>Herron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus</p>
<p>vacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.  The officials</p>
<p>thus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce</p>
<p>the Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course</p>
<p>of obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace</p>
<p>them by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my</p>
<p>determination to have its provisions enforced.  The President at once</p>
<p>made inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal,</p>
<p>and I replied :</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT,</p>
<p>&quot;New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge</p>
<p>E. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron,</p>
<p>Attorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor</p>
<p>of the City of New Orleans.  These removals were made under the</p>
<p>powers granted me in what is usually termed the &#x27;military bill,&#x27;</p>
<p>passed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of</p>
<p>these men, especially after the investigations made by the military</p>
<p>board on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the</p>
<p>congressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has</p>
<p>been made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as</p>
<p>follows :</p>
<p>&quot;The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court</p>
<p>in the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months</p>
<p>previous to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion</p>
<p>of the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost</p>
<p>promising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case</p>
<p>such an event occurred.  The records of his court will show that he</p>
<p>fulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.</p>
<p>&quot;In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of</p>
<p>Louisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this</p>
<p>criminal court.  This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt</p>
<p>to impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the</p>
<p>victims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making</p>
<p>the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.  He was therefore, in my</p>
<p>belief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the</p>
<p>massacre of July 30.</p>
<p>&quot;Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when</p>
<p>backed by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and</p>
<p>a judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and</p>
<p>let the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force</p>
<p>in the riot and massacre.</p>
<p>&quot;With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst</p>
<p>elements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an</p>
<p>immunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how</p>
<p>insecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions</p>
<p>in the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the</p>
<p>reorganization of this State.</p>
<p>&quot;I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General U. S. A.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Armies of the United States,</p>
<p>&quot;Washington, D.  C.&quot;</p>
<p>To General Grant my reasons were satisfactory, but not so to the</p>
<p>President, who took no steps, however, to rescind my action, for he</p>
<p>knew that the removals were commended by well-nigh the entire</p>
<p>community in the city, for it will be understood that Mr. Johnson</p>
<p>was, through his friends and adherents in Louisiana and Texas, kept</p>
<p>constantly advised of every step taken by me.  Many of these persons</p>
<p>were active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies,</p>
<p>doing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson</p>
<p>knew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.</p>
<p>The supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of</p>
<p>reconstruction became a law despite the President&#x27;s veto on March 23.</p>
<p>This was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing</p>
<p>methods of registration.  When it reached me officially I began</p>
<p>measures for carrying out its provisions, and on the 28th of March</p>
<p>issued an order to the effect that no elections for the State,</p>
<p>parish, or municipal officers would be held in Louisiana until the</p>
<p>provisions of the laws of Congress entitled &quot;An act to provide for</p>
<p>the more efficient government of the rebel States,&quot; and of the act</p>
<p>supplemental thereto, should have been complied with.  I also</p>
<p>announced that until elections were held in accordance with these</p>
<p>acts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the</p>
<p>holding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would</p>
<p>have expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special</p>
<p>ones in which I myself might take action.  There was one parish,</p>
<p>Livingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the</p>
<p>election previously ordered there, and which therefore took place,</p>
<p>but by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.</p>
<p>In April.  I began the work of administering th Supplemental Law,</p>
<p>which, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a</p>
<p>registration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing</p>
<p>delegate to a Constitutional convention.  It therefore became</p>
<p>necessary to appoint Boards of Registration throughout the election</p>
<p>districts, and on April 10 the boards for the Parish of Orleans were</p>
<p>given out, those for the other parishes being appointed ten days</p>
<p>later.  Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised</p>
<p>definitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was</p>
<p>directed by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it,</p>
<p>pending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr.</p>
<p>Henry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the</p>
<p>following instructions:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.</p>
<p>&quot;New Orleans, La., April io, 1867.</p>
<p>&quot;Special Orders, No.  15.</p>
<p>&quot;....In obedience to the directions contained in the first section of</p>
<p>the Law of Congress entitled &quot;An Act supplemental to an Act entitled</p>
<p>&#x27;An Act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel</p>
<p>States&#x27;&quot; the registration of the legal voters, according to that law</p>
<p>in the Parish of Orleans, will be commenced on the 15th instant, and</p>
<p>must be completed by the 15th of May.</p>
<p>&quot;The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the</p>
<p>Parish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a</p>
<p>Registration district.  Election precincts will remain as at present</p>
<p>constituted.</p>
<p>&quot;....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his</p>
<p>duties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at</p>
<p>these headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act</p>
<p>referred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the</p>
<p>provisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering</p>
<p>the oath therein prescribed to each person registered.</p>
<p>&quot;Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within</p>
<p>their respective districts, having reference to convenience and</p>
<p>facility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day</p>
<p>designated.  Each Board will be entitled to two clerks.  Office-hours</p>
<p>for registration will be from 8 o&#x27;clock till 12 A.  M., and from 4</p>
<p>till 7 P.  m.</p>
<p>&quot;When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district</p>
<p>will designate the number of polls and the places where they shall be</p>
<p>opened in the election precincts within its district, appoint the</p>
<p>commissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting</p>
<p>the elections, and will superintend the same.</p>
<p>&quot;They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the</p>
<p>different precincts the result of the vote, consolidate the same, and</p>
<p>forward it to the commanding general.</p>
<p>&quot;Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to</p>
<p>a rigid accountability and will be subject to trial by military</p>
<p>commission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct in the</p>
<p>performance of their duties.  Their rate of compensation and manner</p>
<p>of payment will be in accordance with the provisions of sections six</p>
<p>and seven of the supplemental act.</p>
<p>&quot;....Every male citizen of the United States, twenty-one years old</p>
<p>and upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, who has</p>
<p>been resident in the State of Louisiana for one year and Parish of</p>
<p>Orleans for three months previous to the date at which he presents</p>
<p>himself for registration, and who has not been disfranchised by act</p>
<p>of Congress or for felony at common law, shall, after having taken</p>
<p>and subscribed the oath prescribed in the first section of the act</p>
<p>herein referred to, be entitled to be, and shall be, registered as a</p>
<p>legal voter in the Parish of Orleans and State of Louisiana.</p>
<p>&quot;Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on</p>
<p>the question as to who are disfranchised by law, registers will give</p>
<p>the most rigid interpretation to the law, and exclude from</p>
<p>registration every person about whose right to vote there may be a</p>
<p>doubt.  Any person so excluded who may, under the decision of the</p>
<p>Attorney-General, be entitled to vote, shall be permitted to register</p>
<p>after that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.</p>
<p>&quot;By command of Major-General P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;GEO. L. HARTSUFF,</p>
<p>&quot;Assistant Adjutant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>The parish Boards of Registration were composed of three members</p>
<p>each.  Ability to take what was known as the &quot;ironclad oath&quot; was the</p>
<p>qualification exacted of the members, and they were prohibited from</p>
<p>becoming candidates for office.  In the execution of their duties</p>
<p>they were to be governed by the provisions of the supplemental act.</p>
<p>It was also made one of their functions to designate the number and</p>
<p>location of the polling-places in the several districts, to appoint</p>
<p>commissioners for receiving the votes and in general to attend to</p>
<p>such other matters as were necessary, in order properly to conduct</p>
<p>the voting, and afterward to receive from the commissioners the</p>
<p>result of the vote and forward it to my headquarters.  These</p>
<p>registers, and all other officers having to do with elections, were</p>
<p>to be held to a rigid accountability, and be subject to trial by</p>
<p>military commission for fraud or unlawful or improper conduct in the</p>
<p>performance of their duties; and in order to be certain that the</p>
<p>Registration Boards performed their work faithfully and</p>
<p>intelligently, officers of the army were appointed as supervisors.</p>
<p>To this end the parishes were grouped together conveniently in</p>
<p>temporary districts, each officer having from three to five parishes</p>
<p>to supervise.  The programme thus mapped out for carrying out the law</p>
<p>in Louisiana was likewise adhered to in Texas, and indeed was</p>
<p>followed as a model in some of the other military districts.</p>
<p>Although Military Commissions were fully authorized by the</p>
<p>Reconstruction acts, yet I did not favor their use in governing the</p>
<p>district, and probably would never have convened one had these acts</p>
<p>been observed in good faith.  I much preferred that the civil courts,</p>
<p>and the State and municipal authorities already in existence, should</p>
<p>perform their functions without military control or interference, but</p>
<p>occasionally, because the civil authorities neglected their duty, I</p>
<p>was obliged to resort to this means to ensure the punishment Of</p>
<p>offenders.  At this time the condition of the negroes in Texas and</p>
<p>Louisiana was lamentable, though, in fact, not worse than that of the</p>
<p>few white loyalists who had been true to the Union during the war.</p>
<p>These last were singled out as special objects of attack, and were,</p>
<p>therefore, obliged at all times to be on the alert for the protection</p>
<p>of their lives and property.  This was the natural outcome of Mr.</p>
<p>Johnson&#x27;s defiance of Congress, coupled with the sudden conversion to</p>
<p>his cause of persons in the North--who but a short time before had</p>
<p>been his bitterest enemies; for all this had aroused among the</p>
<p>disaffected element new hopes of power and place, hopes of being at</p>
<p>once put in political control again, with a resumption of their</p>
<p>functions in State and National matters without any preliminary</p>
<p>authorization by Congress.  In fact, it was not only hoped, but</p>
<p>expected, that things were presently to go on just as if there had</p>
<p>been no war.</p>
<p>In the State of Texas there were in 1865 about 200,000 of the colored</p>
<p>race-roughly, a third of the entire population--while in Louisiana</p>
<p>there were not less than 350,000, or more than one-half of all the</p>
<p>people in the State.  Until the enactment of the Reconstruction laws</p>
<p>these negroes were without rights, and though they had been liberated</p>
<p>by the war, Mr. Johnson&#x27;s policy now proposed that they should have</p>
<p>no political status at all, and consequently be at the mercy of a</p>
<p>people who, recently their masters, now seemed to look upon them as</p>
<p>the authors of all the misfortunes that had come upon the land.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances the blacks naturally turned for protection</p>
<p>to those who had been the means of their liberation, and it would</p>
<p>have been little less than inhuman to deny them sympathy.  Their</p>
<p>freedom had been given them, and it was the plain duty of those in</p>
<p>authority to make it secure, and screen them from the bitter</p>
<p>political resentment that beset them, and to see that they had a fair</p>
<p>chance in the battle of life.  Therefore, when outrages and murders</p>
<p>grew frequent, and the aid of the military power was an absolute</p>
<p>necessity for the protection of life, I employed it unhesitatingly--</p>
<p>the guilty parties being brought to trial before military</p>
<p>commissions--and for a time, at least, there occurred a halt in the</p>
<p>march of terrorism inaugurated by the people whom Mr. Johnson had</p>
<p>deluded.</p>
<p>The first, Military Commission was convened to try the case of John</p>
<p>W. Walker, charged with shooting a negro in the parish of St. John.</p>
<p>The proper civil authorities had made no effort to arrest Walker, and</p>
<p>even connived at his escape, so I had him taken into custody in New</p>
<p>Orleans, and ordered him tried, the commission finding him guilty,</p>
<p>and sentencing him to confinement in the penitentiary for six months.</p>
<p>This shooting was the third occurrence of the kind that had taken</p>
<p>place in St.  John&#x27;s parish, a negro being wounded in each case, and</p>
<p>it was plain that the intention was to institute there a practice of</p>
<p>intimidation which should be effective to subject the freedmen to the</p>
<p>will of their late masters, whether in making labor contracts, or in</p>
<p>case these newly enfranchised negroes should evince a disposition to</p>
<p>avail themselves of the privilege to vote.</p>
<p>The trial and conviction of Walker, and of one or two others for</p>
<p>similiar outrages, soon put a stop to every kind of &quot;bull-dozing &quot; in</p>
<p>the country parishes; but about this time I discovered that many</p>
<p>members of the police force in New Orleans were covertly intimidating</p>
<p>the freedmen there, and preventing their appearance at the</p>
<p>registration offices, using milder methods than had obtained in the</p>
<p>country, it is true, but none the less effective.</p>
<p>Early in 1866 the Legislature had passed an act which created for the</p>
<p>police of New Orleans a residence qualification, the object of which</p>
<p>was to discharge and exclude from the force ex-Union soldiers.  This</p>
<p>of course would make room for the appointment of ex-Confederates, and</p>
<p>Mayor Monroe had not been slow in enforcing the provisions of the</p>
<p>law.  It was, in fact, a result of this enactment that the police was</p>
<p>so reorganized as to become the willing and efficient tool which it</p>
<p>proved to be in the riot of 1866; and having still the same</p>
<p>personnel, it was now in shape to prevent registration by threats,</p>
<p>unwarranted arrests, and by various other influences, all operating</p>
<p>to keep the timid blacks away from the registration places.</p>
<p>That the police were taking a hand in this practice of repression, I</p>
<p>first discovered by the conduct of the assistant to the chief of the</p>
<p>body, and at once removed the offender, but finding this ineffectual</p>
<p>I annulled that part of the State law fixing the five years&#x27;</p>
<p>residence restriction, and restored the two years&#x27; qualification,</p>
<p>thus enabling Mayor Heath, who by my appointment had succeeded</p>
<p>Monroe, to organize the force anew, and take about one-half of its</p>
<p>members from ex-Union soldiers who when discharged had settled in New</p>
<p>Orleans.  This action put an end to intimidation in the parish of</p>
<p>Orleans; and now were put in operation in all sections the processes</p>
<p>provided by the supplemental Reconstruction law for the summoning of</p>
<p>a convention to form a Constitution preparatory to the readmission of</p>
<p>the State, and I was full of hope that there would now be much less</p>
<p>difficulty in administering the trust imposed by Congress.</p>
<p>During the two years previous great damage had been done the</p>
<p>agricultural interests of Louisiana by the overflow of the</p>
<p>Mississippi, the levees being so badly broken as to require extensive</p>
<p>repairs, and the Legislature of 1866 had appropriated for the purpose</p>
<p>$4,000,000, to be raised by an issue of bonds.  This money was to be</p>
<p>disbursed by a Board of Levee Commissioners then in existence, but</p>
<p>the term of service of these commissioners, and the law creating the</p>
<p>board, would expire in the spring of 1867.  In order to overcome this</p>
<p>difficulty the Legislature passed a bill continuing the commissioners</p>
<p>in office but as the act was passed inside of ten days before the</p>
<p>adjournment of the Legislature, Governor Wells pocketed the bill, and</p>
<p>it failed to become a law.  The Governor then appointed a board of</p>
<p>his own, without any warrant of law whatever.  The old commissioners</p>
<p>refused to recognize this new board, and of course a conflict of</p>
<p>authority ensued, which, it was clear, would lead to vicious results</p>
<p>if allowed to continue; so, as the people of the State had no</p>
<p>confidence in either of the boards, I decided to end the contention</p>
<p>summarily by appointing an entirely new commission, which would</p>
<p>disburse the money honestly, and further the real purpose for which</p>
<p>it had been appropriated.  When I took this course the legislative</p>
<p>board acquiesced, but Governor Wells immediately requested the</p>
<p>President to revoke my order, which, however, was not done, but</p>
<p>meanwhile the Secretary of War directed me to suspend all proceedings</p>
<p>in the matter, and make a report of the facts.  I complied in the</p>
<p>following telegram:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT,</p>
<p>&quot;NEW ORLEANS, La., June 3, 1867.</p>
<p>&quot;SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of</p>
<p>this date in reference to the Levee Commissioners in this State.</p>
<p>&quot;The following were my reasons for abolishing the two former boards,</p>
<p>although I intended that my order should be sufficiently explanatory:</p>
<p>&quot;Previous to the adjournment of the Legislature last winter it passed</p>
<p>an act continuing the old Levee board in office, so that the four</p>
<p>millions of dollars ($4,000,000) in bonds appropriated by the</p>
<p>Legislature might be disbursed by a board of rebellious antecedents.</p>
<p>&quot;After its adjournment the Governor of the State appointed a board of</p>
<p>his own, in violation of this act, and made the acknowledgment to me</p>
<p>in person that his object was to disburse the money in the interest</p>
<p>of his own party by securing for it the vote of the employees at the</p>
<p>time of election.</p>
<p>&quot;The board continued in office by the Legislature refused to turn</p>
<p>over to the Governor&#x27;s board, and each side appealed to me to sustain</p>
<p>it, which I would not do.  The question must then have gone to the</p>
<p>courts, which, according to the Governor&#x27;s judgment when he was</p>
<p>appealing to me to be sustained, would require one year for decision.</p>
<p>Meantime the State was overflowed, the Levee boards tied up by</p>
<p>political chicanery, and nothing done to relieve the poor people, now</p>
<p>fed by the charity of the Government and charitable associations of</p>
<p>the North.</p>
<p>&quot;To obviate this trouble, and to secure to the overflowed districts</p>
<p>of the State the immediate relief which the honest disbursement of</p>
<p>the four millions ($4,000,000) would give, my order dissolving both</p>
<p>boards was issued.</p>
<p>&quot;I say now, unequivocally, that Governor Wells is a political</p>
<p>trickster and a dishonest man.  I have seen him myself, when I first</p>
<p>came to this command, turn out all the Union men who had supported</p>
<p>the Government, and put in their stead rebel soldiers who had not yet</p>
<p>doffed their gray uniform.  I have seen him again, during the July</p>
<p>riot of 1866, skulk away where I could not find him to give him a</p>
<p>guard, instead of coming out as a manly representative of the State</p>
<p>and joining those who were preserving the peace.  I have watched him</p>
<p>since, and his conduct has been as sinuous as the mark left in the</p>
<p>dust by the movement of a snake.</p>
<p>&quot;I say again that he is dishonest, and that dishonesty is more than</p>
<p>must be expected of me.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General, U. S. A.</p>
<p>&quot;Hon. E. M. STANTON,</p>
<p>&quot;Secretary of War, Washington, D.  C.&quot;</p>
<p>The same day that I sent my report to the Secretary of War I removed</p>
<p>from office Governor Wells himself, being determined to bear no</p>
<p>longer with the many obstructions he had placed in the way of</p>
<p>reorganizing the civil affairs of the State.  I was also satisfied</p>
<p>that he was unfit to retain the place, since he was availing himself</p>
<p>of every opportunity to work political ends beneficial to himself.</p>
<p>In this instance Wells protested to me against his removal, and also</p>
<p>appealed to the President for an opinion of the Attorney-General as</p>
<p>to my power in the case; and doubtless he would have succeeded in</p>
<p>retaining his office, but for the fact that the President had been</p>
<p>informed by General James B. Steadman and others placed to watch me</p>
<p>that Wells was wholly unworthy.</p>
<p>&quot;NEW ORLEANS, June 19, 1867.</p>
<p>&quot;ANDREW JOHNSON, President United States,</p>
<p>&quot;Washington City:</p>
<p>&quot;Lewis D.  Campbell leaves New Orleans for home this evening.  Want</p>
<p>of respect for Governor Wells personally, alone represses the</p>
<p>expression of indignation felt by all honest and sensible men at the</p>
<p>unwarranted usurpation of General Sheridan in removing the civil</p>
<p>officers of Louisiana.  It is believed here that you will reinstate</p>
<p>Wells.  He is a bad man, and has no influence.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe Sheridan made the removals to embarrass you, believing the</p>
<p>feeling at the North would sustain him.  My conviction is that on</p>
<p>account of the bad character of Wells and Monroe, you ought not to</p>
<p>reinstate any who have been removed, because you cannot reinstate any</p>
<p>without reinstating all, but you ought to prohibit the exercise of</p>
<p>this power in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>&quot;JAMES B. STEADMAN.&quot;</p>
<p>I appointed Mr. Thomas J. Durant as Wells&#x27;s successor, but he</p>
<p>declining, I then appointed Mr. Benjamin F. Flanders, who, after I</p>
<p>had sent a staff-officer to forcibly eject Wells in case of</p>
<p>necessity, took possession of the Governor&#x27;s office.  Wells having</p>
<p>vacated, Governor Flanders began immediately the exercise of his</p>
<p>duties in sympathy with the views of Congress, and I then notified</p>
<p>General Grant that I thought he need have no further apprehension</p>
<p>about the condition of affairs in Louisiana, as my appointee was a</p>
<p>man of such integrity and ability that I already felt relieved of</p>
<p>half my labor.  I also stated in the same despatch that nothing would</p>
<p>answer in Louisiana but a bold and firm course, and that in taking</p>
<p>such a one I felt that I was strongly supported; a statement that was</p>
<p>then correct, for up to this period the better classes were disposed</p>
<p>to accept the Congressional plan of reconstruction.</p>
<p>During the controversy over the Levee Commissioners, and the</p>
<p>correspondence regarding the removal of Governor Wells, registration</p>
<p>had gone on under the rules laid down for the boards.  The date set</p>
<p>for closing the books was the 3oth of June, but in the parish of</p>
<p>Orleans the time was extended till the 15th of July.  This the</p>
<p>President considered too short a period, and therefore directed the</p>
<p>registry lists not to be closed before the 1st of August, unless</p>
<p>there was some good reason to the contrary.  This was plainly</p>
<p>designed to keep the books open in order that under the Attorney-</p>
<p>General&#x27;s interpretation of the Reconstruction laws, published June</p>
<p>20, many persons who had been excluded by the registration boards</p>
<p>could yet be registered, so I decided to close the registration,</p>
<p>unless required by the President unconditionally, and in specific</p>
<p>orders, to extend the time.  My motives were manifold, but the main</p>
<p>reasons were that as two and a half months had been given already,</p>
<p>the number of persons who, under the law, were qualified for registry</p>
<p>was about exhausted; and because of the expense I did not feel</p>
<p>warranted in keeping up the boards longer, as I said, &quot;to suit new</p>
<p>issues coming in at the eleventh hour,&quot; which would but open a &quot;broad</p>
<p>macadamized road for perjury and fraud.&quot;</p>
<p>When I thus stated what I intended to do, the opinion of the</p>
<p>Attorney-General had not yet been received.  When it did reach me it</p>
<p>was merely in the form of a circular signed by Adjutant-General</p>
<p>Townsend, and had no force of law.  It was not even sent as an order,</p>
<p>nor was it accompanied by any instructions, or by anything except the</p>
<p>statement that it was transmitted to the 11 respective military</p>
<p>commanders for their information, in order that there might be</p>
<p>uniformity in the execution  of the Reconstruction acts.  To adopt</p>
<p>Mr. Stanbery&#x27;s interpretation of the law and reopen registration</p>
<p>accordingly, would defeat the purpose of Congress, as well as add to</p>
<p>my perplexities.  Such a course would also require that the officers</p>
<p>appointed by me for the performance of specified duties, under laws</p>
<p>which I was empowered to interpret and enforce, should receive their</p>
<p>guidance and instructions from an unauthorized source, so on</p>
<p>communicating with General Grant as to how I should act, he directed</p>
<p>me to enforce my own construction of the military bill until ordered</p>
<p>to do otherwise.</p>
<p>Therefore the registration continued as I had originally directed,</p>
<p>and nothing having been definitely settled at Washington in relation</p>
<p>to my extending the time, on the 10th of July I ordered all the</p>
<p>registration boards to select, immediately, suitable persons to act</p>
<p>as commissioners of election, and at the same time specified the</p>
<p>number of each set of commissioners, designated the polling-places,</p>
<p>gave notice that two days would be allowed for voting, and followed</p>
<p>this with an order discontinuing registration the 31st of July, and</p>
<p>then another appointing the 27th and 28th of September as the time</p>
<p>for the election of delegates to the State convention.</p>
<p>In accomplishing the registration there had been little opposition</p>
<p>from the mass of the people, but the press of New Orleans, and the</p>
<p>office-holders and office-seekers in the State generally, antagonized</p>
<p>the work bitterly and violently, particularly after the promulgation</p>
<p>of the opinion of the Attorney-General.  These agitators condemned</p>
<p>everybody and everything connected with the Congressional plan of</p>
<p>reconstruction; and the pernicious influence thus exerted was</p>
<p>manifested in various ways, but most notably in the selection of</p>
<p>persons to compose the jury lists in the country parishes it also</p>
<p>tempted certain municipal officers in New Orleans to perform illegal</p>
<p>acts that would seriously have affected the credit of the city had</p>
<p>matters not been promptly corrected by the summary removal from</p>
<p>office of the comptroller and the treasurer, who had already issued a</p>
<p>quarter of a million dollars in illegal certificates.  On learning of</p>
<p>this unwarranted and unlawful proceeding, Mayor Heath demanded an</p>
<p>investigation by the Common Council, but this body, taking its cue</p>
<p>from the evident intention of the President to render abortive the</p>
<p>Reconstruction acts, refused the mayor&#x27;s demand.  Then he tried to</p>
<p>have the treasurer and comptroller restrained by injunction, but the</p>
<p>city attorney, under the same inspiration as the council, declined to</p>
<p>sue out a writ, and the attorney being supported in this course by</p>
<p>nearly all the other officials, the mayor was left helpless in his</p>
<p>endeavors to preserve the city&#x27;s credit.  Under such circumstances he</p>
<p>took the only step left him--recourse to the military commander; and</p>
<p>after looking into the matter carefully I decided, in the early part</p>
<p>of August, to give the mayor officials who would not refuse to make</p>
<p>an investigation of the illegal issue of certificates, and to this</p>
<p>end I removed the treasurer, surveyor, comptroller, city attorney,</p>
<p>and twenty-two of the aldermen; these officials, and all of their</p>
<p>assistants, having reduced the financial credit of New Orleans to a</p>
<p>disordered condition, and also having made efforts--and being then</p>
<p>engaged in such--to hamper the execution of the Reconstruction laws.</p>
<p>This action settled matters in the city, but subsequently I had to</p>
<p>remove some officials in the parishes--among them a justice of the</p>
<p>peace and a sheriff in the parish of Rapides; the justice for</p>
<p>refusing to permit negro witnesses to testify in a certain murder</p>
<p>case, and for allowing the murderer, who had foully killed a colored</p>
<p>man, to walk out of his court on bail in the insignificant sum of</p>
<p>five hundred dollars; and the sheriff, for conniving at the escape</p>
<p>from jail of another alleged murderer.  Finding, however, even after</p>
<p>these removals, that in the country districts murderers and other</p>
<p>criminals went unpunished, provided the offenses were against negroes</p>
<p>merely (since the jurors were selected exclusively from the whites,</p>
<p>and often embraced those excluded from the exercise of the election</p>
<p>franchise) I, having full authority under the Reconstruction laws,</p>
<p>directed such a revision of the jury lists as would reject from them</p>
<p>every man not eligible for registration as a voter.  This order was</p>
<p>issued August 24, and on its promulgation the President relieved me</p>
<p>from duty and assigned General Hancock as my successor.</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT,</p>
<p>&quot;NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 24, 1867.</p>
<p>&quot;SPECIAL ORDERS, No.  125.</p>
<p>&quot;The registration of voters of the State of Louisiana, according to</p>
<p>the law of Congress, being complete, it is hereby ordered that no</p>
<p>person who is not registered in accordance with said law shall be</p>
<p>considered as, a duly qualified voter of the State of Louisiana.  All</p>
<p>persons duly registered as above, and no others, are consequently</p>
<p>eligible, under the laws of the State of Louisiana, to serve as</p>
<p>jurors in any of the courts of the State.</p>
<p>&quot;The necessary revision of the jury lists will immediately be made by</p>
<p>the proper officers.</p>
<p>&quot;All the laws of the State respecting exemptions, etc., from jury</p>
<p>duty will remain in force.</p>
<p>By command of Major-General P. H. SHERIDAN.</p>
<p>&quot;GEO. L. HARTNUFF, Asst. Adj&#x27;t-General.&quot;</p>
<p>Pending the arrival of General Hancock, I turned over the command of</p>
<p>the district September 1 to General Charles Griffin; but he dying of</p>
<p>yellow fever, General J. A. Mower succeeded him, and retained command</p>
<p>till November 29, on which date General Hancock assumed control.</p>
<p>Immediately after Hancock took charge, he revoked my order of August</p>
<p>24 providing for a revision of the jury lists; and, in short,</p>
<p>President Johnson&#x27;s policy now became supreme, till Hancock himself</p>
<p>was relieved in March, 1868.</p>
<p>My official connection with the reconstruction of Louisiana and Texas</p>
<p>practically closed with this order concerning the jury lists.  In my</p>
<p>judgment this had become a necessity, for the disaffected element,</p>
<p>sustained as it was by the open sympathy of the President, had grown</p>
<p>so determined in its opposition to the execution of the</p>
<p>Reconstruction acts that I resolved to remove from place and power</p>
<p>all obstacles; for the summer&#x27;s experience had convinced me that in</p>
<p>no other way could the law be faithfully administered.</p>
<p>The President had long been dissatisfied with my course; indeed, he</p>
<p>had harbored personal enmity against me ever since he perceived that</p>
<p>he could not bend me to an acceptance of the false position in which</p>
<p>he had tried to place me by garbling my report of the riot of 1866.</p>
<p>When Mr. Johnson decided to remove me, General Grant protested in</p>
<p>these terms, but to no purpose:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>&quot;WASHINGTON, D. C., August 17, 1867</p>
<p>&quot;SIR: I am in receipt of your order of this date directing the</p>
<p>assignment of General G. H. Thomas to the command of the Fifth</p>
<p>Military District, General Sheridan to the Department of the</p>
<p>Missouri, and General Hancock to the Department of the Cumberland;</p>
<p>also your note of this date (enclosing these instructions), saying:</p>
<p>&#x27;Before you issue instructions to carry into effect the enclosed</p>
<p>order, I would be pleased to hear any suggestions you may deem</p>
<p>necessary respecting the assignments to which the order refers.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I am pleased to avail myself of this invitation to urge--earnestly</p>
<p>urge--urge in the name of a patriotic people, who have sacrificed</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of loyal lives and thousands of millions of</p>
<p>treasure to preserve the integrity and union of this country--that</p>
<p>this order be not insisted on.  It is unmistakably the expressed wish</p>
<p>of the country that General Sheridan should not be removed from his</p>
<p>present command.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a republic where the will of the people is the law of the</p>
<p>land.  I beg that their voice may be heard.</p>
<p>&quot;General Sheridan has performed his civil duties faithfully and</p>
<p>intelligently.  His removal will only be regarded as an effort to</p>
<p>defeat the laws of Congress.  It will be interpreted by the</p>
<p>unreconstructed element in the South--those who did all they could to</p>
<p>break up this Government by arms, and now wish to be the only element</p>
<p>consulted as to the method of restoring order--as a triumph.  It will</p>
<p>embolden them to renewed opposition to the will of the loyal masses,</p>
<p>believing that they have the Executive with them.</p>
<p>&quot;The services of General Thomas in battling for the Union entitle him</p>
<p>to some consideration.  He has repeatedly entered his protest against</p>
<p>being assigned to either of the five military districts, and</p>
<p>especially to being assigned to relieve General Sheridan.</p>
<p>&quot;There are military reasons, pecuniary reasons, and above all,</p>
<p>patriotic reasons, why this should not be insisted upon.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg to refer to a letter marked &#x27;private,&#x27; which I wrote to the</p>
<p>President when first consulted on the subject of the change in the</p>
<p>War Department.  It bears upon the subject of this removal, and I had</p>
<p>hoped would have prevented it.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT,</p>
<p>&quot;General U. S. A., Secretary of War ad interim.</p>
<p>&quot;His Excellency A. JOHNSON,</p>
<p>&quot;President of the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>I was ordered to command the Department of the Missouri (General</p>
<p>Hancock, as already noted, finally becoming my successor in the Fifth</p>
<p>Military District), and left New Orleans on the 5th of September.  I</p>
<p>was not loath to go.  The kind of duty I had been performing in</p>
<p>Louisiana and Texas was very trying under the most favorable</p>
<p>circumstances, but all the more so in my case, since I had to contend</p>
<p>against the obstructions which the President placed in the way from</p>
<p>persistent opposition to the acts of Congress as well as from</p>
<p>antipathy to me--which obstructions he interposed with all the</p>
<p>boldness and aggressiveness of his peculiar nature.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion while I was exercising this command,</p>
<p>impurity of motive was imputed to me, but it has never been</p>
<p>truthfully shown (nor can it ever be) that political or corrupt</p>
<p>influences of any kind controlled me in any instance.  I simply tried</p>
<p>to carry out, without fear or favor, the Reconstruction acts as they</p>
<p>came to me.  They were intended to disfranchise certain persons, and</p>
<p>to enfranchise certain others, and, till decided otherwise, were the</p>
<p>laws of the land; and it was my duty to execute them faithfully,</p>
<p>without regard, on the one hand, for those upon whom it was thought</p>
<p>they bore so heavily, nor, on the other, for this or that political</p>
<p>party, and certainly without deference to those persons sent to</p>
<p>Louisiana to influence my conduct of affairs.</p>
<p>Some of these missionaries were high officials, both military and</p>
<p>civil, and I recall among others a visit made me in 1866 by a</p>
<p>distinguished friend of the President, Mr. Thomas A. Hendricks.  The</p>
<p>purpose of his coming was to convey to me assurances of the very high</p>
<p>esteem in which I was held by the President, and to explain</p>
<p>personally Mr. Johnson&#x27;s plan of reconstruction, its flawless</p>
<p>constitutionality, and so on.  But being on the ground, I had before</p>
<p>me the exhibition of its practical working, saw the oppression and</p>
<p>excesses growing out of it, and in the face of these experiences even</p>
<p>Mr. Hendricks&#x27;s persuasive eloquence was powerless to convince me of</p>
<p>its beneficence.  Later General Lovell H. Rousseau came down on a</p>
<p>like mission, but was no more successful than Mr. Hendricks.</p>
<p>During the whole period that I commanded in Louisiana and Texas my</p>
<p>position was a most unenviable one.  The service was unusual, and the</p>
<p>nature of it scarcely to be understood by those not entirely familiar</p>
<p>with the conditions existing immediately after the war.  In</p>
<p>administering the affairs of those States, I never acted except by</p>
<p>authority, and always from conscientious motives.  I tried to guard</p>
<p>the rights of everybody in accordance with the law.  In this I was</p>
<p>supported by General Grant and opposed by President Johnson.  The</p>
<p>former had at heart, above every other consideration, the good of his</p>
<p>country, and always sustained me with approval and kind suggestions.</p>
<p>The course pursued by the President was exactly the opposite, and</p>
<p>seems to prove that ,in the whole matter of reconstruction he was</p>
<p>governed less by patriotic motives than by personal ambitions.  Add</p>
<p>to this his natural obstinacy of character and personal enmity toward</p>
<p>me, and no surprise should be occasioned when I say that I heartily</p>
<p>welcomed the order that lifted from me my unsought burden.</p>

<p>PARING FOR A WINTER CAMPAIGN--MEETING &quot;BUFFALO BILL&quot;--HE UNDERTAKES A</p>
<p>DANGEROUS TASK--FORSYTH&#x27;S GALLANT FIGHT--RESCUED.</p>
<p>The headquarters of the military department to which I was assigned</p>
<p>when relieved from duty at New Orleans was at Fort Leavenworth,</p>
<p>Kansas, and on the 5th of September I started for that post.  In due</p>
<p>time I reached St. Louis, and stopped there a day to accept an</p>
<p>ovation tendered in approval of the course I had pursued in the Fifth</p>
<p>Military District--a public demonstration apparently of the most</p>
<p>sincere and hearty character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From St. Louis to Leavenworth took but one night, and the next day I</p>
</blockquote>
<p>technically complied with my orders far enough to permit General</p>
<p>Hancock to leave the department, so that he might go immediately to</p>
<p>New Orleans if he so desired, but on account of the yellow fever</p>
<p>epidemic then prevailing, he did not reach the city till late in</p>
<p>November.</p>
<p>My new command was one of the four military departments that composed</p>
<p>the geographical division then commanded by Lieutenant-General</p>
<p>Sherman.  This division had been formed in 1866, with a view to</p>
<p>controlling the Indians west of the Missouri River, they having</p>
<p>become very restless and troublesome because of the building of the</p>
<p>Pacific railroads through their hunting-grounds, and the</p>
<p>encroachments of pioneers, who began settling in middle and western</p>
<p>Kansas and eastern Colorado immediately after the war.</p>
<p>My department embraced the States of Missouri and Kansas, the Indian</p>
<p>Territory, and New Mexico.  Part of this section of country--western</p>
<p>Kansas particularly--had been frequently disturbed and harassed</p>
<p>during two or three years past, the savages every now and then</p>
<p>massacring an isolated family, boldly attacking the surveying and</p>
<p>construction parties of the Kansas-Pacific railroad, sweeping down on</p>
<p>emigrant trains, plundering and burning stage-stations and the like</p>
<p>along the Smoky Hill route to Denver and the Arkansas route to New</p>
<p>Mexico.</p>
<p>However, when I relieved Hancock, the department was comparatively</p>
<p>quiet.  Though some military operations had been conducted against</p>
<p>the hostile tribes in the early part of the previous summer, all</p>
<p>active work was now suspended in the attempt to conclude a permanent</p>
<p>peace with the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Kiowas, and Comanches, in</p>
<p>compliance with the act of Congress creating what was known as the</p>
<p>Indian Peace Commission of 1867.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances there was little necessity for my remaining</p>
<p>at Leavenworth, and as I was much run down in health from the</p>
<p>Louisiana climate, in which I had been obliged to live continuously</p>
<p>for three summers (one of which brought epidemic cholera, and another</p>
<p>a scourge of yellow fever), I took a leave of absence for a few</p>
<p>months, leaving Colonel A. J. Smith, of the Seventh Cavalry,</p>
<p>temporarily in charge of my command.</p>
<p>On this account I did not actually go on duty in the department of</p>
<p>the Missouri till March, 1868.  On getting back I learned that the</p>
<p>negotiations of the Peace Commissioners held at Medicine Lodge, about</p>
<p>seventy miles south of Fort Larned had resulted in a treaty with the</p>
<p>Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Kiowas, and Comanches, by which agreement it</p>
<p>was supposed all troubles had been settled.  The compact, as</p>
<p>concluded, contained numerous provisions, the most important to us</p>
<p>being one which practically relinquished the country between the</p>
<p>Arkansas and Platte rivers for white settlement; another permitted</p>
<p>the peaceable construction of the Pacific railroads through the same</p>
<p>region; and a third requiring the tribes signing the treaty to retire</p>
<p>to reservations allotted them in the Indian Territory.  Although the</p>
<p>chiefs and head-men were well-nigh unanimous in ratifying these</p>
<p>concessions, it was discovered in the spring of 1868 that many of the</p>
<p>young men were bitterly opposed to what had been done, and claimed</p>
<p>that most of the signatures had been obtained by misrepresentation</p>
<p>and through proffers of certain annuities, and promises of arms and</p>
<p>ammunition to be issued in the spring of 1868.  This grumbling was</p>
<p>very general in extent, and during the winter found outlet in</p>
<p>occasional marauding, so, fearing a renewal of the pillaging and</p>
<p>plundering at an early day, to prepare myself for the work evidently</p>
<p>ahead the first thing I did on assuming permanent command was to make</p>
<p>a trip to Fort Larned and Fort Dodge, near which places the bulk of</p>
<p>the Indians had congregated on Pawnee and Walnut creeks.  I wanted to</p>
<p>get near enough to the camps to find out for myself the actual state</p>
<p>of feeling among the savages, and also to familiarize myself with the</p>
<p>characteristics of the Plains Indians, for my previous experience had</p>
<p>been mainly with mountain tribes on Ehe Pacific coast.  Fort Larned I</p>
<p>found too near the camps for my purpose, its proximity too readily</p>
<p>inviting unnecessary &quot;talks,&quot; so I remained here but a day or two,</p>
<p>and then went on to Dodge, which, though considerably farther away</p>
<p>from the camps, was yet close enough to enable us to obtain easily</p>
<p>information of all that was going on.</p>
<p>It took but a few days at Dodge to discover that great discontent</p>
<p>existed about the Medicine Lodge concessions, to see that the young</p>
<p>men were chafing and turbulent, and that it would require much tact</p>
<p>and good management on the part of the Indian Bureau to persuade the</p>
<p>four tribes to go quietly to their reservations, under an agreement</p>
<p>which, when entered into, many of them protested had not been fully</p>
<p>understood.</p>
<p>A few hours after my arrival a delegation of prominent chiefs called</p>
<p>on me and proposed a council, where they might discuss their</p>
<p>grievances, and thus bring to the notice of the Government the</p>
<p>alleged wrongs done them; but this I refused, because Congress had</p>
<p>delegated to the Peace Commission the whole matter of treating with</p>
<p>them, and a council might lead only to additional complications.  My</p>
<p>refusal left them without hope of securing better terms, or of even</p>
<p>delaying matters longer; so henceforth they were more than ever</p>
<p>reckless and defiant.  Denunciations of the treaty became outspoken,</p>
<p>and as the young braves grew more and more insolent every day, it</p>
<p>amounted to conviction that, unless by some means the irritation was</p>
<p>allayed, hostilities would surely be upon us when the buffalo</p>
<p>returned to their summer feeding-grounds between the Arkansas and the</p>
<p>Platte.</p>
<p>The principal sufferers in this event would be the settlers in middle</p>
<p>and western Kansas, who, entirely ignorant of the dangers hanging</p>
<p>over them, were laboring to build up homes in a new country.  Hence</p>
<p>the maintenance of peace was much to be desired, if it could be</p>
<p>secured without too great concessions, and although I would not meet</p>
<p>the different tribes in a formal council, yet, to ward off from</p>
<p>settlers as much as possible the horrors of savage warfare, I showed,</p>
<p>by resorting to persuasive methods, my willingness to temporize a</p>
<p>good deal.  An abundant supply of rations is usually effective to</p>
<p>keep matters quiet in such cases, so I fed them pretty freely, and</p>
<p>also endeavored to control them through certain men who, I found,</p>
<p>because of former associations, had their confidence.  These men,</p>
<p>employed as scouts, or interpreters, were Mr. William Comstock, Mr.</p>
<p>Abner S. Grover, and Mr. Richard Parr.  They had lived on the Plains</p>
<p>for many years with different tribes of Indians, had trapped and</p>
<p>hunted with them, and knew all the principal chiefs and headmen.</p>
<p>Through such influences, I thought I saw good chances of preserving</p>
<p>peace, and of inducing the discontented to go quietly to their</p>
<p>reservations in the Indian Territory as soon as General Hazen, the</p>
<p>representative of the Peace Commissioners, was ready to conduct them</p>
<p>there from Fort Larned.</p>
<p>Before returning to Leavenworth I put my mediators (as I may call</p>
<p>them) under charge of an officer of the army, Lieutenant F. W.</p>
<p>Beecher, a very intelligent man, and directed him to send them out to</p>
<p>visit among the different tribes, in order to explain what was</p>
<p>intended by the treaty of Medicine Lodge, and to make every effort</p>
<p>possible to avert hostilities.  Under these instructions Comstock and</p>
<p>Grover made it their business to go about among the Cheyennes--the</p>
<p>most warlike tribe of all--then camping about the headwaters of</p>
<p>Pawnee and Walnut creeks, and also to the north and west of Fort</p>
<p>Wallace, while Parr spent his time principally with the Kiowas and</p>
<p>Comanches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the different posts--Wallace, Dodge, and Larned Lieutenant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beecher kept up communication with all three scouts, and through him</p>
<p>I heard from them at least once a week.  Every now and then some</p>
<p>trouble along the railroad or stage routes would be satisfactorily</p>
<p>adjusted and quiet restored, and matters seemed to be going on very</p>
<p>well, the warm weather bringing the grass and buffalo in plenty, and</p>
<p>still no outbreak, nor any act of downright hostility.  So I began to</p>
<p>hope that we should succeed in averting trouble till the favorite war</p>
<p>season of the Indians was over, but the early days of August rudely</p>
<p>ended our fancied tranquility.</p>
<p>In July the encampments about Fort Dodge began to break up, each band</p>
<p>or tribe moving off to some new location north of the Arkansas,</p>
<p>instead of toward its proper reservation to the south of that river.</p>
<p>Then I learned presently that a party of Cheyennes had made a raid on</p>
<p>the Kaws--a band of friendly Indians living near Council Grove--and</p>
<p>stolen their horses, and also robbed the houses of several white</p>
<p>people near Council Grove.  This raid was the beginning of the Indian</p>
<p>war of 1868.  Immediately following it, the Comanches and Kiowas came</p>
<p>to Fort Larned to receive their annuities, expecting to get also the</p>
<p>arms and ammunition promised them at Medicine Lodge, but the raid to</p>
<p>Council Grove having been reported to the Indian Department, the</p>
<p>issue of arms was suspended till reparation was made.  This action of</p>
<p>the Department greatly incensed the savages, and the agent&#x27;s offer of</p>
<p>the annuities without guns and pistols was insolently refused, the</p>
<p>Indians sulking back to their camps, the young men giving themselves</p>
<p>up to war-dances, and to powwows with &quot; medicine-men,&quot; till all hope</p>
<p>of control was gone.</p>
<p>Brevet Brigadier-General Alfred Sully, an officer of long experience</p>
<p>in Indian matters, who at this time was in command Qf the District of</p>
<p>the Arkansas, which embraced Forts Larned and Dodge, having notified</p>
<p>me of these occurrences at Larned, and expressed the opinion that the</p>
<p>Indians were bent on mischief, I directed him there immediately to</p>
<p>act against them.  After he reached Larned, the chances for peace</p>
<p>appeared more favorable.  The Indians came to see him, and protested</p>
<p>that it was only a few bad young men who had been depredating, and</p>
<p>that all would be well and the young men held in check if the agent</p>
<p>would but issue the arms and ammunition.  Believing their promises,</p>
<p>Sully thought that the delivery of the arms would solve all the</p>
<p>difficulties, so on his advice the agent turned them over along with</p>
<p>the annuities, the Indians this time condescendingly accepting.</p>
<p>This issue of arms and ammunition was a fatal mistake; Indian</p>
<p>diplomacy had overreached Sully&#x27;s experience, and even while the</p>
<p>delivery was in progress a party of warriors had already begun a raid</p>
<p>of murder and rapine, which for acts of devilish cruelty perhaps has</p>
<p>no parallel in savage warfare.  The party consisted of about two</p>
<p>hundred Cheyennes and a few Arapahoes, with twenty Sioux who had been</p>
<p>visiting their friends, the Cheyennes.  As near as could be</p>
<p>ascertained, they organized and left their camps along Pawnee Creek</p>
<p>about the 3d of August.  Traveling northeast, they skirted around</p>
<p>Fort Harker, and made their first appearance among the settlers in</p>
<p>the Saline Valley, about thirty miles north of that post.  Professing</p>
<p>friendship and asking food at the farm-houses, they saw the</p>
<p>unsuspecting occupants comply by giving all they could spare from</p>
<p>their scanty stores.  Knowing the Indian&#x27;s inordinate fondness for</p>
<p>coffee, particularly when well sweetened, they even served him this</p>
<p>luxury freely.  With this the demons began their devilish work.</p>
<p>Pretending to be indignant because it was served them in tin cups,</p>
<p>they threw the hot contents into the women&#x27;s faces, and then, first</p>
<p>making prisoners of the men, they, one after another, ravished the</p>
<p>women till the victims became insensible.  For some inexplicable</p>
<p>reason the two farmers were neither killed nor carried off, so after</p>
<p>the red fiends had gone, the unfortunate women were brought in to</p>
<p>Fort Harker, their arrival being the first intimation to the military</p>
<p>that hostilities had actually begun.</p>
<p>Leaving the Saline, this war-party crossed over to the valley of the</p>
<p>Solomon, a more thickly settled region, and where the people were in</p>
<p>better circumstances, their farms having been started two or three</p>
<p>years before.  Unaware of the hostile character of the raiders, the</p>
<p>people here received them in the friendliest way, providing food, and</p>
<p>even giving them ammunition, little dreaming of what was impending.</p>
<p>These kindnesses were requited with murder and pillage, and worse,</p>
<p>for all the women who fell into their hands were subjected to horrors</p>
<p>indescribable by words.  Here also the first murders were committed,</p>
<p>thirteen men and two women being killed.  Then, after burning five</p>
<p>houses and stealing all the horses they could find, they turned back</p>
<p>toward the Saline, carrying away as prisoners two little girls named</p>
<p>Bell, who have never been heard of since.</p>
<p>It was probably the intention to finish, as they marched back to the</p>
<p>south, the devilish work begun on the Saline, but before they reached</p>
<p>that valley on the return, the victims left there originally had fled</p>
<p>to Fort Harker, as already explained, and Captain Benteen was now</p>
<p>nearing the little settlement with a troop of cavalry, which he had</p>
<p>hurriedly marched from Fort Zarah.  The savages were attacking the</p>
<p>house of a Mr. Schermerhorn, where a few of the settlers had</p>
<p>collected for defense, when Benteen approached.  Hearing the firing,</p>
<p>the troopers rode toward the sound at a gallop, but when they</p>
<p>appeared in view, coming over the hills, the Indians fled in all</p>
<p>directions, escaping punishment through their usual tactics of</p>
<p>scattering over the Plains, so as to leave no distinctive trail.</p>
<p>When this frightful raid was taking place, Lieutenant Beecher, with</p>
<p>his three scouts--Comstock, Grover, and Parr--was on Walnut Creek.</p>
<p>Indefinite rumors about troubles on the Saline and Solomon reaching</p>
<p>him, he immediately sent Comstock and Grover over to the headwaters</p>
<p>of the Solomon, to the camp of a band of Cheyennes, whose chief was</p>
<p>called &quot;Turkey Leg,&quot; to see if any of the raiders belonged there; to</p>
<p>learn the facts, and make explanations, if it was found that the</p>
<p>white people had been at fault.  For years this chief had been a</p>
<p>special friend of Comstock and Grover.  They had trapped, hunted, and</p>
<p>lived with his band, and from this intimacy they felt confident of</p>
<p>being able to get &quot;Turkey Leg&quot; to quiet his people, if any of them</p>
<p>were engaged in the raid; and, at all events, they expected, through</p>
<p>him and his band, to influence the rest of the Cheyennes.  From the</p>
<p>moment they arrived in the Indian village, however, the two scouts</p>
<p>met with a very cold reception.  Neither friendly pipe nor food was</p>
<p>offered them, and before they could recover from their chilling</p>
<p>reception, they were peremptorily ordered out of the village, with</p>
<p>the intimation that when the Cheyennes were on the war-path the</p>
<p>presence of whites was intolerable.  The scouts were prompt to leave,</p>
<p>of course, and for a few miles were accompanied by an escort of seven</p>
<p>young men, who said they were sent with them to protect the two from</p>
<p>harm.  As the party rode along over the prairie, such a depth of</p>
<p>attachment was professed for Comstock and Grover that,</p>
<p>notwithstanding all the experience of their past lives, they were</p>
<p>thoroughly deceived, and in the midst of a friendly conversation some</p>
<p>of the young warriors fell suddenly to the rear and treacherously</p>
<p>fired on them.</p>
<p>At the volley Comstock fell from his horse instantly killed.  Grover,</p>
<p>badly wounded in the shoulder, also fell to the ground near Comstock</p>
<p>Seeing his comrade was dead,Grover made use of his friend&#x27;s body to</p>
<p>protect himself, lying close behind it.  Then took place a remarkable</p>
<p>contest, Grover, alone and severely wounded, obstinately fighting the</p>
<p>seven Indians, and holding them at bay for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Being an expert shot, and having a long-range repeating rifle, he</p>
<p>&quot;stood off &quot; the savages till dark.  Then cautiously crawling away on</p>
<p>his belly to a deep ravine, he lay close, suffering terribly from his</p>
<p>wound, till the following night, when, setting out for Fort Wallace,</p>
<p>he arrived there the succeeding day, almost crazed from pain and</p>
<p>exhaustion.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the fiendish atrocities committed on the Saline</p>
<p>and Solomon rivers and the attack on Comstock and Grover, the</p>
<p>pillaging and murdering began on the Smoky Hill stage-route, along</p>
<p>the upper Arkansas River and on the headwaters of the Cimarron.  That</p>
<p>along the Smoky Hill and north of it was the exclusive work of, the</p>
<p>Cheyennes, a part of the Arapahoes, and the few Sioux allies</p>
<p>heretofore mentioned, while the raiding on the Arkansas and Cimarron</p>
<p>was done principally by the Kiowas under their chief, Satanta, aided</p>
<p>by some of the Comanches.  The young men of these tribes set out on</p>
<p>their bloody work just after the annuities and guns were issued at</p>
<p>Larned, and as soon as they were well on the road the rest of the</p>
<p>Comanches and Kiowas escaped from the post and fled south of the</p>
<p>Arkansas.  They were at once pursued by General Sully with a small</p>
<p>force, but by the time he reached the Cimarron the war-party had</p>
<p>finished its raid on tHe upper Arkansas, and so many Indians combined</p>
<p>against Sully that he was compelled to withdraw to Fort Dodge, which</p>
<p>he reached not without considerable difficulty, and after three</p>
<p>severe fights.</p>
<p>These, and many minor raids which followed, made it plain that a</p>
<p>general outbreak was upon us.  The only remedy, therefore, was to</p>
<p>subjugate the savages immediately engaged in the forays by forcing</p>
<p>the several tribes to settle down on the reservations set apart by</p>
<p>the treaty of Medicine Lodge.  The principal mischief-makers were the</p>
<p>Cheyennes.  Next in deviltry were the Kiowas, and then the Arapahoes</p>
<p>and Comanches.  Some few of these last two tribes continued friendly,</p>
<p>or at least took no active part in the raiding, but nearly all the</p>
<p>young men of both were the constant allies of the Cheyennes and</p>
<p>Kiowas.  All four tribes together could put on the war-path a</p>
<p>formidable force of about 6,000 warriors.  The subjugation of this</p>
<p>number of savages would be no easy task, so to give the matter my</p>
<p>undivided attention I transferred my headquarters from Leavenworth to</p>
<p>Fort Hays, a military post near which the prosperous town of Hays</p>
<p>City now stands.</p>
<p>Fort Hays was just beyond the line of the most advanced settlements,</p>
<p>and was then the terminus of the Kansas-Pacific railroad.  For this</p>
<p>reason it could be made a depot of supplies, and was a good point</p>
<p>from which to supervise matters in the section of country to be</p>
<p>operated in, which district is a part of the Great American Plains,</p>
<p>extending south from the Platte River in Nebraska to the Red River in</p>
<p>the Indian Territory, and westward from the line of frontier</p>
<p>settlements to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, a vast region</p>
<p>embracing an area of about 150,000 square miles.  With the exception</p>
<p>of a half-dozen military posts and a few stations on the two overland</p>
<p>emigrant routes--the Smoky Hill to Denver, and the Arkansas to New</p>
<p>Mexico--this country was an unsettled waste known only to the Indians</p>
<p>and a few trappers.  There were neither roads nor well-marked trails,</p>
<p>and the only timber to be found--which generally grew only along the</p>
<p>streams--was so scraggy and worthless as hardly to deserve the name.</p>
<p>Nor was water by any means plentiful, even though the section is</p>
<p>traversed by important streams, the Republican, the Smoky Hill, the</p>
<p>Arkansas, the Cimarron, and the Canadian all flowing eastwardly, as</p>
<p>do also their tributaries in the main.  These feeders are sometimes</p>
<p>long and crooked, but as a general thing the volume of water is</p>
<p>insignificant except after rain-falls.  Then, because of unimpeded</p>
<p>drainage, the little streams fill up rapidly with torrents of water,</p>
<p>which quickly flows off or sinks into the sand, leaving only an</p>
<p>occasional pool without visible inlet or outlet.</p>
<p>At the period of which I write, in 1868, the Plains were covered with</p>
<p>vast herds of buffalo--the number has been estimated at 3,000,000</p>
<p>head--and with such means of subsistence as this everywhere at hand,</p>
<p>the 6,000 hostiles were wholly unhampered by any problem of food-</p>
<p>supply.  The savages were rich too according to Indian standards,</p>
<p>many a lodge owning from twenty to a hundred ponies; and</p>
<p>consciousness of wealth and power, aided by former temporizing, had</p>
<p>made them not only confident but defiant.  Realizing that their</p>
<p>thorough subjugation would be a difficult task, I made up my mind to</p>
<p>confine operations during the grazing and hunting season to</p>
<p>protecting the people of the new settlements and on the overland</p>
<p>routes, and then, when winter came, to fall upon the savages</p>
<p>relentlessly, for in that season their ponies would be thin, and weak</p>
<p>from lack of food, and in the cold and snow, without strong ponies to</p>
<p>transport their villages and plunder, their movements would be so</p>
<p>much impeded that the troops could overtake them.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of hostilities I had in all, east of New Mexico, a</p>
<p>force of regulars numbering about 2,600 men--1,200 mounted and 1,400</p>
<p>foot troops.  The cavalry was composed of the Seventh and Tenth</p>
<p>regiments; the infantry, of the Third and Fifth regiments and four</p>
<p>companies of the Thirty-Eighth.  With these few troops all the posts</p>
<p>along the Smoky Hill and Arkansas had to be garrisoned, emigrant</p>
<p>trains escorted, and the settlements and routes of travel and the</p>
<p>construction parties on the Kansas-Pacific railway protected.  Then,</p>
<p>too, this same force had to furnish for the field small movable</p>
<p>columns, that were always on the go, so it will be rightly inferred</p>
<p>that every available man was kept busy from the middle of August till</p>
<p>November; especially as during this period the hostiles attacked over</p>
<p>forty widely dispersed places, in nearly all cases stealing horses,</p>
<p>burning houses, and killing settlers.  It was of course impossible to</p>
<p>foresee where these descents would be made, but as soon as an attack</p>
<p>was heard of assistance was always promptly rendered, and every now</p>
<p>and then we succeeded in killing a few savages.  As a general thing,</p>
<p>though, the raiders escaped before relief arrived, and when they had</p>
<p>a few miles the start, all efforts to catch them were futile.  I</p>
<p>therefore discouraged long pursuits, and, in fact, did not approve of</p>
<p>making any at all unless the chances of obtaining paying results were</p>
<p>very evident, otherwise the troops would be worn out by the time the</p>
<p>hard work of the winter was demanded from them.</p>
<p>To get ready for a winter campaign of six months gave us much to do.</p>
<p>The thing most needed was more men, so I asked for additional</p>
<p>cavalry, and all that could be spareds--even troops of the Fifth</p>
<p>Cavalry--was sent tome.  Believing this reinforcement insufficient,</p>
<p>to supplement it I applied for a regiment of Kansas volunteers, which</p>
<p>request being granted, the organization of the regiment was</p>
<p>immediately begun at Topeka.  It was necessary also to provide a</p>
<p>large amount of transportation and accumulate quantities of stores,</p>
<p>since the campaign probably would not end till spring.  Another</p>
<p>important matter was to secure competent guides for the different</p>
<p>columns of troops, for, as I have said, the section of country to be</p>
<p>operated in was comparatively unknown.</p>
<p>In those days the railroad town of Hays City was filled with so</p>
<p>called &quot;Indian scouts,&quot; whose common boast was of having slain scores</p>
<p>of redskins, but the real scout--that is, a &#x27;guide and trailer</p>
<p>knowing the habits of the Indians--was very scarce, and it was hard</p>
<p>to find anybody familiar with the country south of the Arkansas,</p>
<p>where the campaign was to be made.  Still, about Hays City and the</p>
<p>various military posts there was some good material to select from,</p>
<p>and we managed to employ several men, who, from their experience on</p>
<p>the Plains in various capacities, or from natural instinct and</p>
<p>aptitude, soon became excellent guides and courageous and valuable</p>
<p>scouts, some of them, indeed, gaining much distinction.  Mr. William</p>
<p>F. Cody (&quot;Buffalo Bill&quot;), whose renown has since become world-wide,</p>
<p>was one of the men thus selected.  He received his sobriquet from his</p>
<p>marked success in killing buffaloes for a contractor, to supply fresh</p>
<p>meat to the construction parties, on the Kansas-Pacific railway.  He</p>
<p>had given up this business, however, and was now in the employ of the</p>
<p>quartermaster&#x27;s department of the army, and was first brought to my</p>
<p>notice by distinguishing himself in bringing me an important despatch</p>
<p>from Fort Larned to Fort Hays, a distance of sixty-five miles,</p>
<p>through a section infested with Indians.  The despatch informed me</p>
<p>that the Indians near Larned were preparing to decamp, and this</p>
<p>intelligence required that certain orders should be carried to Fort</p>
<p>Dodge, ninety-five miles south of Hays.  This too being a</p>
<p>particularly dangerous route--several couriers having been killed on</p>
<p>it--it was impossible to get one of the various &quot;Petes,&quot; &quot;Jacks,&quot; or</p>
<p>&quot;Jims&quot; hanging around Hays City to take my communication.  Cody</p>
<p>learning of the strait I was in, manfully came to the rescue, and</p>
<p>proposed to make the trip to Dodge, though he had just finished his</p>
<p>long and perilous ride from Larned.  I gratefully accepted his offer,</p>
<p>and after four or five hours&#x27; rest he mounted a fresh horse and</p>
<p>hastened on his journey, halting but once to rest on the way, and</p>
<p>then only for an hour, the stop being made at Coon Creek, where he</p>
<p>got another mount from a troop of cavalry.  At Dodge he took six</p>
<p>hours&#x27; sleep, and then continued on to his own post--Fort Larned--</p>
<p>with more despatches.  After resting twelve hours at Larned, he was</p>
<p>again in the saddle with tidings for me at Fort Hays, General Hazen</p>
<p>sending him, this time, with word that the villages had fled to the</p>
<p>south of the Arkansas.  Thus, in all, Cody rode about 350 miles in</p>
<p>less than sixty hours, and such an exhibition of endurance and</p>
<p>courage was more than enough to convince me that his services would</p>
<p>be extremely valuable in the campaign, so I retained him at Fort Hays</p>
<p>till the battalion of the Fifth Cavalry arrived, and then made him</p>
<p>chief of scouts for that regiment.</p>
<p>The information brought me by Cody on his second trip from Larned</p>
<p>indicated where the villages would be found in the winter, and I</p>
<p>decided to move on them about the 1st of November.  Only the women</p>
<p>and children and the decrepit old men were with the villages, however</p>
<p>enough, presumably, to look after the plunder most of the warriors</p>
<p>remaining north of the Arkansas to continue their marauding.  Many</p>
<p>severe fights occurred between our troops and these marauders, and in</p>
<p>these affairs, before November 1 over a hundred Indians were killed,</p>
<p>yet from the ease with which the escaping savages would disappear</p>
<p>only to fall upon remote settlements with pillage and murder, the</p>
<p>results were by no means satisfactory.  One of the most noteworthy of</p>
<p>these preliminary affairs was the gallant fight made on the</p>
<p>Republican River the 17th of September by my Aide, Colonel George A.</p>
<p>Forsyth, and party, against about seven hundred Cheyennes and Sioux.</p>
<p>Forsyth, with Lieutenant Beecher, and Doctor J. H. Mooers as surgeon,</p>
<p>was in charge of a company of citizen scouts, mostly expert rifle-</p>
<p>shots, but embracing also a few Indian fighters, among these Grover</p>
<p>and Parr.  The company was organized the latter part of August for</p>
<p>immediate work in defense of the settlements, and also for future use</p>
<p>in the Indian Territory when the campaign should open there.  About</p>
<p>the time the company had reached its complement--it was limited to</p>
<p>forty-seven men and three officers--a small band of hostiles began</p>
<p>depredations near Sheridan City, one of the towns that grew up over-</p>
<p>night on the Kansas-Pacific railway.  Forsyth pursued this party, but</p>
<p>failing to overtake it, made his way into Fort Wallace for rations,</p>
<p>intending to return from there to Fort Hays.  Before he started back,</p>
<p>however, another band of Indians appeared near the post and stole</p>
<p>some horses from the stage company.  This unexpected raid made</p>
<p>Forsyth hot to go for the marauders, and he telegraphed me for</p>
<p>permission, which I as promptly gave him.  He left the post on the</p>
<p>10th of September, the command consisting of himself, Lieutenant</p>
<p>Beecher, Acting Assistant Surgeon Mooers, and the full strength,</p>
<p>forty-seven men, with a few pack mules carrying about ten days&#x27;</p>
<p>rations.</p>
<p>He headed north toward the Republican River.  For the first two days</p>
<p>the trail was indistinct and hard to follow.  During the next three</p>
<p>it continued to grow much larger, indicating plainly that the number</p>
<p>of Indians ahead was rapidly increasing.  Of course this sign meant a</p>
<p>fight as soon as a large enough force was mustered, but as this was</p>
<p>what Forsyth was after, he pushed ahead with confidence and alacrity.</p>
<p>The night of the 16th of September he encamped on the Arickaree</p>
<p>branch of the Republican, not far from the forks of the river, with</p>
<p>the expectation of resuming the march as usual next day, for the</p>
<p>indications were that the main body of the savages must be still a</p>
<p>long way off, though in the preceding twenty-four hours an occasional</p>
<p>Indian had been seen.</p>
<p>But the enemy was much nearer than was thought, for at daybreak on</p>
<p>the morning of the 17th he made known his immediate presence by a</p>
<p>sudden dash at Forsyth&#x27;s horses, a few of which were stampeded and</p>
<p>captured before the scouts could reach them.  This dash was made by a</p>
<p>small party only to get the horses, so those engaged in it were soon</p>
<p>driven off, but a few minutes later hundreds of savages--it was</p>
<p>afterward learned that seven hundred warriors took part in the fight-</p>
<p>-hitherto invisible, showed themselves on the hills overlooking the</p>
<p>camp and so menacingly as to convince Forsyth that his defense must</p>
<p>be one of desperation.  The only place at hand that gave any hope of</p>
<p>successful resistance was a small island in the Arickaree, the</p>
<p>channel on one side being about a foot deep while on the other it was</p>
<p>completely dry; so to this position a hurried retreat was made.  All</p>
<p>the men and the remaining animals reached the island in safety, but</p>
<p>on account of the heavy fire poured in from the neighboring hills the</p>
<p>packs containing the rations and medicines had to be abandoned.</p>
<p>On seeing Forsyth&#x27;s hasty move, the Indians, thinking they had him,</p>
<p>prepared to overwhelm the scouts by swooping down on one side of the</p>
<p>island with about five hundred mounted warriors, while about two</p>
<p>hundred, covered by the tall grass in the river-bottom attacked the</p>
<p>other side, dismounted.  But the brave little band sadly disappointed</p>
<p>them.  When the charge came it was met with such a deadly fire that a</p>
<p>large number of the fiends were killed, some of them even after</p>
<p>gaining the bank of the island.  This check had the effect of making</p>
<p>the savages more wary, but they were still bold enough to make two</p>
<p>more assaults before mid-day.  Each of these ending like the first,</p>
<p>the Indians thereafter contented themselves with shooting all the</p>
<p>horses, which had been tied up to some scraggy little cottonwood-</p>
<p>trees, and then proceeded to lay siege to the party.</p>
<p>The first man struck was Forsyth himself.  He was hit three times in</p>
<p>all--twice in one leg, both serious wounds, and once on the head, a</p>
<p>slight abrasion of the scalp.  A moment later Beecher was killed and</p>
<p>Doctor Mooers mortally wounded: and in addition to these misfortunes</p>
<p>the scouts kept getting hit, till several were killed, and the whole</p>
<p>number of casualties had reached twenty-one in a company of forty-</p>
<p>seven.  Yet with all this, and despite the seeming hopelessness of</p>
<p>the situation, the survivors kept up their pluck undiminished, and</p>
<p>during a lull succeeding the third repulse dug into the loose soil</p>
<p>till the entire party was pretty well protected by rifle-pits.  Thus</p>
<p>covered they stood off the Indians for the next three days, although</p>
<p>of course their condition became deplorable from lack of food, while</p>
<p>those who were hurt suffered indescribable agony, since no means were</p>
<p>at hand for dressing their wounds.</p>
<p>By the third day the Indians, seeming to despair of destroying the</p>
<p>beleaguered party before succor might arrive, began to draw off, and</p>
<p>on the fourth wholly disappeared.  The men were by this time nearly</p>
<p>famished for food.  Even now there was nothing to be had except</p>
<p>horse-meat from the carcasses of the animals killed the first day,</p>
<p>and this, though decidedly unpalatable, not to say disgusting, had to</p>
<p>be put up with, and so on such unwholesome stuff they managed to live</p>
<p>for four days longer, at the end of which time they were rescued by a</p>
<p>column of troops under Colonel Bankhead, which had hastened from Fort</p>
<p>Wallace in response to calls for help, carried there by two brave</p>
<p>fellows--Stilwell and Truedell--who, volunteering to go for relief,</p>
<p>had slipped through the Indians, and struck out for that post in the</p>
<p>night after the first day&#x27;s fight.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII,</p>
<p>FITTING OUT THE WINTER EXPEDITION--ACCOMPANYING THE MAIN FORCE--THE</p>
<p>OTHER COLUMNS--STRUCK BY A BLIZZARD--CUSTER&#x27;S FIGHT ON THE WASHITA--</p>
<p>DEFEAT AND DEATH OF BLACK KETTLE--MASSACRE OF ELLIOTT&#x27;S PARTY--RELIEF</p>
<p>OF COLONEL CRAWFORD.</p>
<p>The end of October saw completed the most of my arrangements for the</p>
<p>winter campaign, though the difficulties and hardships to be</p>
<p>encountered had led several experienced officers of the army, and</p>
<p>some frontiersmen like Mr. James Bridger, the famous scout and, guide</p>
<p>of earlier days, to discourage the project.  Bridger even went so far</p>
<p>as to come out from St. Louis to dissuade me, but I reasoned that as</p>
<p>the soldier was much better fed and clothed than the Indian, I had</p>
<p>one great advantage, and that, in short, a successful campaign could</p>
<p>be made if the operations of the different columns were energetically</p>
<p>conducted.  To see to this I decided to go in person with the main</p>
<p>column, which was to push down into the western part of the Indian</p>
<p>Territory, having for its initial objective the villages which, at</p>
<p>the beginning of hostilities, had fled toward the head-waters of the</p>
<p>Red River, and those also that had gone to the same remote region</p>
<p>after decamping from the neighborhood of Larned at the time that</p>
<p>General Hazen sent Buffalo Bill to me with the news.</p>
<p>The column which was expected to do the main work was to be composed</p>
<p>of the Nineteenth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, commanded by Colonel</p>
<p>Crawford; eleven troops of the Seventh United States Cavalry, under</p>
<p>General Custer, and a battalion of five companies of infantry under</p>
<p>Brevet Major John H. Page.  To facilitate matters, General Sully, the</p>
<p>district commander, was ordered to rendezvous these troops and</p>
<p>establish a supply depot about a hundred miles south of Fort Dodge,</p>
<p>as from such a point operations could be more readily conducted.  He</p>
<p>selected for the depot a most suitable place at the confluence of</p>
<p>Beaver and Wolf creeks, and on his arrival there with Custer&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Page&#x27;s commands, named the place Camp Supply.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the main column, two others also were to</p>
<p>penetrate the Indian Territory.  One of these, which was to march</p>
<p>east from New Mexico by way of Fort Bascom was to be composed of six</p>
<p>troops of the Third Cavalry and two companies of infantry, the whole</p>
<p>under Colonel A. W. Evans.  The other, consisting of seven troops of</p>
<p>the Fifth Cavalry, and commanded by Brevet Brigadier-General Eugene</p>
<p>A. Carr, was to march southeast from Fort Lyon; the intention being</p>
<p>that Evans and Carr should destroy or drive in toward old Fort Cobb</p>
<p>any straggling bands that might be prowling through the country west</p>
<p>of my own line of march; Carr, as he advanced, to be joined by Brevet</p>
<p>Brigadier-General W. H. Penrose, with five troops of cavalry already</p>
<p>in the field southeast of Lyon.  The Fort Bascom column, after</p>
<p>establishing a deepot of supplies at Monument Creek, was to work down</p>
<p>the main Canadian, and remain out as long as it could feed itself</p>
<p>from New Mexico; Carr, having united with Penrose on the North</p>
<p>Canadian, was to operate toward the Antelope Hills and headwaters of</p>
<p>the Red River; while I, with the main column was to move southward to</p>
<p>strike the Indians along the Washita, or still farther.  south on</p>
<p>branches of the Red River.</p>
<p>It was no small nor easy task to outfit all these troops by the time</p>
<p>cold weather set in, and provide for them during the winter, but by</p>
<p>the 1st of November I had enough supplies accumulated at Forts Dodge</p>
<p>and Lyon for my own and Carr&#x27;s columns, and in addition directed</p>
<p>subsistence and forage for three months to be sent to Fort Gibson for</p>
<p>final delivery at Fort Arbuckle, as I expected to feed the command</p>
<p>from this place when we arrived in the neighborhood of old Fort Cobb,</p>
<p>but through some mismanagement few of these stores got further than</p>
<p>Gibson before winter came on.</p>
<p>November 1, all being ready, Colonel Grawford was furnished with</p>
<p>competent guides, and, after sending two troops to Fort Dodge to act</p>
<p>as my escort, with the rest of his regiment he started from Topeka</p>
<p>November 5, under orders to march straight for the rendezvous at the</p>
<p>junction of Beaver and Wolf creeks.  He was expected to reach his</p>
<p>destination about the 20th, and there unite with the Seventh Cavalry</p>
<p>and the battalion of infantry, which in the mean time were on the</p>
<p>march from Dodge.  A few days later Carr and Evans began their march</p>
<p>also, and everything being now in motion, I decided to go to Camp</p>
<p>Supply to give the campaign my personal attention, determined to</p>
<p>prove that operations could be successfully conducted in spite of</p>
<p>winter, and bent on showing the Indians that they were not secure</p>
<p>from punishment because of inclement weather--an ally on which they</p>
<p>had hitherto relied with much assurance.</p>
<p>We started from Fort Hays on the 15th of N6vember, and the first</p>
<p>night out a blizzard struck us and carried away our tents; and as the</p>
<p>gale was so violent that they could not be put up again, the rain and</p>
<p>snow drenched us to the skin.  Shivering from wet and cold, I took</p>
<p>refuge under a wagon, and there spent such a miserable night that,</p>
<p>when at last morning came, the gloomy predictions of old man Bridger</p>
<p>and others rose up before me with greatly increased force.  As we</p>
<p>took the road the sleet and snow were still falling, but we labored</p>
<p>on to Dodge that day in spite of the fact that many of the mules</p>
<p>played out on the way.  We stayed only one night at Dodge, and then</p>
<p>on the 17th, escorted by a troop of cavalry and Forsyth&#x27;s scouts, now</p>
<p>under the command of Lieutenant Lewis Pepoon, crossed the Arkansas</p>
<p>and camped the night of the 18th at Bluff Creek, where the two troops</p>
<p>of the Nineteenth Kansas, previously detailed as my escort, were</p>
<p>awaiting our coming.  As we were approaching this camp some</p>
<p>suspicious looking objects were seen moving off at a long distance to</p>
<p>the east of us, but as the scouts confidently pronounced them</p>
<p>buffalo, we were unaware of their true character till next morning,</p>
<p>when we became satisfied that what we had seen were Indians, for</p>
<p>immediately after crossing Beaver Creek we struck a trail, leading to</p>
<p>the northeast, of a war party that evidently came up from the head-</p>
<p>waters of the Washita River.</p>
<p>The evening of November 21we arrived at the Camp Supply depot, having</p>
<p>traveled all day in another snowstorm that did not end till twenty-</p>
<p>four hours later.  General Sully, with Custer&#x27;s regiment and the</p>
<p>infantry battalion, had reached the place several days before, but</p>
<p>the Kansas regiment had not yet put in an appearance.  All hands were</p>
<p>hard at work trying to shelter the stores and troops, but from the</p>
<p>trail seen that morning, believing that an opportunity offered to</p>
<p>strike an effective blow, I directed Custer to call in his working</p>
<p>parties and prepare to move immediately, without waiting for</p>
<p>Crawford&#x27;s regiment, unaccountably absent.  Custer was ready to start</p>
<p>by the 23d, and he was then instructed to march north to where the</p>
<p>trail had been seen near Beaver Creek and follow it on the back</p>
<p>track, for, being convinced that the war party had come from the</p>
<p>Washita, I felt certain that this plan would lead directly to the</p>
<p>villages.</p>
<p>The difficulties attending a winter campaign were exhibited now with</p>
<p>their full force, as the march had to be conducted through a snow-</p>
<p>storm that hid surrounding objects, and so covered the country as to</p>
<p>alter the appearance of the prominent features, making the task of</p>
<p>the guides doubly troublesome; but in spite of these obstacles</p>
<p>fifteen miles had been traversed when Custer encamped for the night.</p>
<p>The next day the storm had ceased, and the weather was clear and</p>
<p>cold.  The heavy fall of snow had of course obliterated the trail in</p>
<p>the bottoms, and everywhere on the level; but, thanks to the wind,</p>
<p>that had swept comparatively bare the rough places and high ground,</p>
<p>the general direction could be traced without much trouble.  The</p>
<p>day&#x27;s march, which was through a country abounding with buffalo, was</p>
<p>unattended by any special incident at first, but during the</p>
<p>afternoon, after getting the column across the Canadian River--an</p>
<p>operation which, on account of the wagons, consumed considerable</p>
<p>time--Custer&#x27;s scouts (friendly Osages) brought back word that, some</p>
<p>miles ahead, they had struck fresh signs, a trail coming into the old</p>
<p>one from the north, which, in their opinion, indicated that the war</p>
<p>party was returning to the villages.</p>
<p>On the receipt of this news, Custer, leaving a guard with the wagons,</p>
<p>hastily assembled the rest of his men&#x27; and pushing on rapidly,</p>
<p>overtook the scouts and a detailed party from his regiment which had</p>
<p>accompanied them, all halted on the new trail awaiting his arrival.</p>
<p>A personal examination satisfied Custer that the surmises of his</p>
<p>scouts were correct; and also that the fresh trail in the deep snow</p>
<p>could at night be followed with ease.  After a short halt for supper</p>
<p>and rest the pursuit was resumed, the Osage scouts in advance, and</p>
<p>although the hostile Indians were presumed to be yet some distance</p>
<p>off, every precaution was taken to prevent detection and to enable</p>
<p>our troops to strike them unawares.  The fresh trail, which it was</p>
<p>afterward ascertained had been made by raiders from Black Kettle&#x27;s</p>
<p>village of Cheyennes, and by some Arapahoes, led into the valley of</p>
<p>the Washita, and growing fresher as the night wore on, finally</p>
<p>brought the Osages upon a campfire, still smoldering, which, it was</p>
<p>concluded, had been built by the Indian boys acting as herders of the</p>
<p>ponies during the previous day.  It was evident, then, that the</p>
<p>village could be but a few miles off; hence the pursuit was continued</p>
<p>with redoubled caution until, a few hours before dawn of the 27th, as</p>
<p>the leading scouts peered over a rise on the line of march, they</p>
<p>discovered a large body of animals in the valley below.</p>
<p>As soon as they reported this discovery, Custer determined to</p>
<p>acquaint himself with the situation by making a reconnoissance in</p>
<p>person, accompanied by his principal officers.  So, sending back word</p>
<p>to halt the cavalry, he directed the officers to ride forward with</p>
<p>him; then dismounting, the entire party crept cautiously to a high</p>
<p>point which overlooked the valley, and from where, by the bright moon</p>
<p>then shining, they saw just how the village was situated. Its</p>
<p>position was such as to admit of easy approach from all sides.  So,</p>
<p>to preclude an escape of the Indians, Custer decided to attack at</p>
<p>daybreak, and from four different directions.</p>
<p>The plan having been fully explained to the officers, the remaining</p>
<p>hours of the night were employed in making the necessary</p>
<p>dispositions.  Two of the detachments left promptly, since they had</p>
<p>to make a circuitous march of several miles to Teach the points</p>
<p>designated for their attack; the third started a little later; and</p>
<p>then the fourth and last, under Custer himself, also moved into</p>
<p>position.  As the first light grew visible in the east, each column</p>
<p>moved closer in to the village, and then, all dispositions having</p>
<p>been made according to the prearranged plan, from their appointed</p>
<p>places the entire force to the opening notes of &quot;Garry Owen,&quot; played</p>
<p>by the regimental band as the signal for the attack--dashed at a</p>
<p>gallop into the village.  The sleeping and unsuspecting savages were</p>
<p>completely surprised by the onset; yet after the first confusion,</p>
<p>during which the impulse to escape principally actuated them, they</p>
<p>seized their weapons, and from behind logs and trees, or plunging</p>
<p>into the stream and using its steep bank as a breastwork, they poured</p>
<p>upon their assailants a heavy fire, and kept on fighting with every</p>
<p>exhibition of desperation.  In such a combat mounted men were</p>
<p>useless, so Custer directed his troopers to fight on, foot, and the</p>
<p>Indians were successively driven from one point of vantage to</p>
<p>another, until, finally, by 9 o&#x27;clock the entire camp was in his</p>
<p>possession and the victory complete.  Black Kettle and over one</p>
<p>hundred of his warriors were killed, and about fifty women and</p>
<p>children captured; but most of the noncombatants, as well as a few</p>
<p>warriors and boys, escaped in the confusion of the fight.  Making</p>
<p>their way down the river, these fugitives alarmed the rest of the</p>
<p>Cheyennes and Arapahoes, and also the Kiowas and Comanches, whose</p>
<p>villages were in close proximity--the nearest not more than two miles</p>
<p>off.</p>
<p>Then of course all the warriors of these tribes rallied to attack</p>
<p>Custer, who meantime was engaged burning Black Kettle&#x27;s camp and</p>
<p>collecting his herds of ponies.  But these new foes were rather wary</p>
<p>and circumspect, though they already had partial revenge in an</p>
<p>unlooked for way by cutting off Major Elliott and fifteen men, who</p>
<p>had gone off in pursuit of a batch of young warriors when the fight</p>
<p>was going on at the village.  In fact, the Indians had killed</p>
<p>Elliott&#x27;s whole party, though neither the fate of the poor fellows,</p>
<p>nor how they happened to be caught, was known till long afterward.</p>
<p>It was then ascertained that the detachment pursued a course due</p>
<p>south, nearly at right angles to the Washita River, and after</p>
<p>galloping a couple of miles over the hills, crossing a small branch</p>
<p>of the Washita on the way, they captured some of the fugitives.  In</p>
<p>bringing the prisoners back, Elliott was in turn attacked on the open</p>
<p>prairie by a large number of savages from farther down the Washita,</p>
<p>who by this time were swarming to the aid of Black Kettle&#x27;s village.</p>
<p>The little band fought its way gallantly to within rifle-range of the</p>
<p>small creek referred to, but could get no farther, for the Indians</p>
<p>had taken up a position in the bed of the stream, and from under</p>
<p>cover of its banks Elliott and all his remaining men were quickly</p>
<p>killed.  No relief was sent them, for Custer, not having seen Elliott</p>
<p>set out, knew nothing of the direction taken, and, besides, was busy</p>
<p>burning the villages and securing the ponies, and deeply concerned,</p>
<p>too, with defending himself from the new dangers menacing him.</p>
<p>Elliott and his brave little party were thus left to meet their fate</p>
<p>alone.</p>
<p>While Custer was burning the lodges and plunder and securing the</p>
<p>ponies, the Indians from the villages down the Washita were gathering</p>
<p>constantly around him till by mid-day they had collected in</p>
<p>thousands, and then came a new problem as to what should be done.  If</p>
<p>he attacked the other villages, there was great danger of his being</p>
<p>overwhelmed, and should he start back to Camp Supply by daylight, he</p>
<p>would run the risk of losing his prisoners and the ponies, so,</p>
<p>thinking the matter over, he decided to shoot all the ponies, and</p>
<p>keep skirmishing with the savages till nightfall, and then, under</p>
<p>cover of the darkness, return to Camp Supply; a programme that was</p>
<p>carried out successfully, but Custer&#x27;s course received some severe</p>
<p>criticism because no effort was made to discover what had become of</p>
<p>Elliott.</p>
<p>Custer had, in all, two officers and nineteen men killed, and two</p>
<p>officers and eleven men wounded.  The blow struck was a most</p>
<p>effective one, and, fortunately, fell on one of the most villanous of</p>
<p>the hostile bands that, without any provocation whatever, had</p>
<p>perpetrated the massacres on the Saline and Solomon, committing</p>
<p>atrocities too repulsive for recital, and whose hands were still red</p>
<p>from their bloody work on the recent raid.  Black Kettle, the chief,</p>
<p>was an old man, and did not himself go with the raiders to the Saline</p>
<p>and Solomon, and on this account his fate was regretted by some.  But</p>
<p>it was old age only that kept him back, for before the demons set out</p>
<p>from Walnut Creek he had freely encouraged them by &quot;making medicine,&quot;</p>
<p>and by other devilish incantations that are gone through with at war</p>
<p>and scalp dances.</p>
<p>When the horrible work was over he undertook to shield himself by</p>
<p>professions of friendship, but being put to the test by my offering</p>
<p>to feed and care for all of his band who would come in to Fort Dodge</p>
<p>and remain there peaceably, he defiantly refused.  The consequence of</p>
<p>this refusal was a merited punishment, only too long delayed.</p>
<p>I received the first news of Custer&#x27;s fight on theWashita on the</p>
<p>morning of November 29.  It was brought to me by one of his white</p>
<p>scouts, &quot;California Joe,&quot; a noted character, who had been</p>
<p>experiencing the ups and downs of pioneer life ever since crossing</p>
<p>the Plains in 1849.  Joe was an invaluable guide and Indian fighter</p>
<p>whenever the clause of the statute prohibiting liquors in theIndian</p>
<p>country happened to be in full force.  At the time in question the</p>
<p>restriction was by no means a dead letter, and Joe came through in</p>
<p>thirty-six hours, though obliged to keep in hiding during daylight of</p>
<p>the 28th.  The tidings brought were joyfully received by everybody at</p>
<p>Camp Supply, and they were particularly agreeable tome, for, besides</p>
<p>being greatly worried about the safety of the command in the extreme</p>
<p>cold and deep snows, I knew that the immediate effect a victory would</p>
<p>be to demoralize the rest of the hostiles, which of course would</p>
<p>greatly facilitate and expedite our ultimate success.  Toward evening</p>
<p>the day after Joe arrived the head of Custer&#x27;s column made its</p>
<p>appearance on the distant hills, the friendly Osage scouts and the</p>
<p>Indian prisoners in advance.  As they drew near, the scouts began a</p>
<p>wild and picturesque performance in celebration of the victory,</p>
<p>yelling, firing their guns, throwing themselves on the necks and</p>
<p>sides of their horses to exhibit their skill in riding, and going</p>
<p>through all sorts of barbaric evolutions and gyrations, which were</p>
<p>continued till night, when the rejoicings were ended with the hideous</p>
<p>scalp dance.</p>
<p>The disappearance of Major Elliott and his party was the only damper</p>
<p>upon our pleasure, and the only drawback to the very successful</p>
<p>expedition.  There was no definite information as to the detachment,</p>
<p>--and Custer was able to report nothing more than that he had not</p>
<p>seen Elliott since just before the fight began.  His theory was,</p>
<p>however, that Elliott and his men had strayed off on account of</p>
<p>having no guide, and would ultimately come in all right to Camp</p>
<p>Supply or make their way back to Fort Dodge; a very unsatisfactory</p>
<p>view of the matter, but as no one knew the direction Elliott had</p>
<p>taken, it was useless to speculate on other suppositions, and</p>
<p>altogether too late to make any search for him.  I was now anxious to</p>
<p>follow up Custer&#x27;s stroke by an immediate move to the south with the</p>
<p>entire column, but the Kansas regiment had not yet arrived.  At first</p>
<p>its nonappearance did not worry me much, for I attributed the delay</p>
<p>to the bad weather, and supposed Colonel Crawford had wisely laid up</p>
<p>during the worst storms.  Further ,waiting, however, would give the</p>
<p>Indians a chance to recover from the recent dispiriting defeat, so I</p>
<p>sent out scouting parties to look Crawford up and hurry him along.</p>
<p>After a great deal of searching, a small detachment of the regiment</p>
<p>was found about fifty miles below us on the North Canadian, seeking</p>
<p>our camp.  This detachment was in a pretty bad plight, and when</p>
<p>brought in, the officer in charge reported that the regiment, by not</p>
<p>following the advice of the guide sent to conduct it to Camp Supply,</p>
<p>had lost its way.  Instead of relying on the guides, Crawford had</p>
<p>undertaken to strike through the canyons of the Cimarron by what</p>
<p>appeared to him a more direct route, and in the deep gorges, filled</p>
<p>as they were with snow, he had been floundering about for days</p>
<p>without being able to extricate his command.  Then, too, the men were</p>
<p>out of rations, though they had been able to obtain enough buffalo</p>
<p>meat to keep from starving.  As for the horses, since they could get</p>
<p>no grass, about seven hundred of them had already perished from</p>
<p>starvation and exposure.  Provisions and guides were immediately sent</p>
<p>out to the regiment, but before the relief could reach Crawford his</p>
<p>remaining horses were pretty much all gone, though the men were</p>
<p>brought in without loss of life.  Thus, the regiment being dismounted</p>
<p>by this misfortune at the threshold of the campaign, an important</p>
<p>factor of my cavalry was lost to me, though as foot-troops the Kansas</p>
<p>volunteers continued to render very valuable services till mustered</p>
<p>out the next spring.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<p>A WINTER EXPEDITION--HERDS OF BUFFALO--WOLVES--BLIZZARDS--A TERRIBLE</p>
<p>NIGHT--FINDING THE BODIES OF ELLIOTT&#x27;S PARTY--THE ABANDONED INDIAN</p>
<p>CAMPS--PUSHING DOWN THE WASHITA--THE CAPTURED CHIEFS--EVANS&#x27;S</p>
<p>SUCCESSFUL FIGHT--ESTABLISHING FORT SILL--&quot;CALIFORNIA JOE&quot;--DUPLICITY</p>
<p>OF THE CHEYENNES--ORDERED TO REPAIR TO WASHINGTON.</p>
<p>A few days were necessarily lost setting up and refitting the Kansas</p>
<p>regiment after its rude experience in the Cimarron canyons.  This</p>
<p>through with, the expedition, supplied with thirty days&#x27; rations,</p>
<p>moved out to the south on the 7th of December, under my personal</p>
<p>command.  We headed for the Witchita Mountains, toward which rough</p>
<p>region all the villages along the Washita River had fled after</p>
<p>Custer&#x27; s fight with Black Kettle.  My line of march was by way of</p>
<p>Custer&#x27;s battle-field, and thence down the Washita, and if the</p>
<p>Indians could not sooner be brought to terms, I intended to follow</p>
<p>them into the Witchita Mountains from near old Fort Cobb.  The snow</p>
<p>was still deep everywhere, and when we started the thermometer was</p>
<p>below zero, but the sky being clear and the day very bright, the</p>
<p>command was in excellent spirits.  The column was made up of ten</p>
<p>companies of the Kansas regiment, dismounted; eleven companies of the</p>
<p>Seventh Cavalry, Pepoon&#x27;s scouts, and the Osage scouts.  In addition</p>
<p>to Pepoon&#x27;s men and the Osages, there was also &quot;California Joe,&quot; and</p>
<p>one or two other frontiersmen besides, to act as guides and</p>
<p>interpreters.  Of all these the principal one, the one who best knew</p>
<p>the country, was Ben Clark, a young man who had lived with the</p>
<p>Cheyennes during much of his boyhood, and who not only had a pretty</p>
<p>good knowledge of the country, but also spoke fluently the Cheyenne</p>
<p>and Arapahoe dialects, and was an adept in the sign language.</p>
<p>The first day we made only about ten miles, which carried us to the</p>
<p>south bank of Wolf Creek.  A considerable part of the day was devoted</p>
<p>to straightening out matters in the command, and allowing time for</p>
<p>equalizing the wagon loads, which as a general thing, on a first</p>
<p>day&#x27;s march, are unfairly distributed.  And then there was an</p>
<p>abundance of fire-wood at Wolf Creek; indeed, here and on Hackberry</p>
<p>Creek--where I intended to make my next camp--was the only timber</p>
<p>north of the Canadian River; and to select the halting places near a</p>
<p>plentiful supply of wood was almost indispensable, for as the men</p>
<p>were provided with only shelter-tents, good fires were needed in</p>
<p>order to keep warm.</p>
<p>The second day, after marching for hours through vast herds of</p>
<p>buffalo, we made Hackberry Creek; but not, however, without several</p>
<p>stampedes in the wagon-train, the buffalo frightening the mules so</p>
<p>that it became necessary to throw out flankers to shoot the leading</p>
<p>bulls and thus turn off the herds.  In the wake of every drove</p>
<p>invariably followed a band of wolves.  This animal is a great coward</p>
<p>usually, but hunger had made these so ravenous that they would come</p>
<p>boldly up to the column, and as quick as a buffalo was killed, or</p>
<p>even disabled, they would fall upon the carcass and eagerly devour</p>
<p>it.  Antelope also were very numerous, and as they were quite tame--</p>
<p>being seldom chased--and naturally very inquisitive, it was not an</p>
<p>unfrequent thing to see one of the graceful little creatures run in</p>
<p>among the men and be made a prisoner.  Such abundance of game</p>
<p>relieved the monotony of the march to Hackberry Creek, but still,</p>
<p>both men and animals were considerably exhausted by their long tramp,</p>
<p>for we made over thirty miles that day.</p>
<p>We camped in excellent shape on the creek and it was well we did, for</p>
<p>a &quot;Norther,&quot; or , &quot;blizzard,&quot; as storms on the Plains are now termed</p>
<p>struck us in the night.  During the continuance of these blizzards,</p>
<p>which is usually about three days, the cold wind sweeps over the</p>
<p>Plains with great force, and, in the latitude of the Indian</p>
<p>Territory, is weighted with great quantities of sleet and snow,</p>
<p>through which it is often impossible to travel; indeed, these</p>
<p>&quot;Northers&quot; have many times proved fatal to the unprotected</p>
<p>frontiersman.  With our numbers the chance of any one&#x27;s being lost,</p>
<p>and perishing alone (one of the most common dangers in a blizzard),</p>
<p>was avoided; but under any circumstances such a storm could but</p>
<p>occasion intense suffering to all exposed to it, hence it would have</p>
<p>been well to remain in camp till the gale was over, but the time</p>
<p>could not be spared.  We therefore resumed the march at an early hour</p>
<p>next morning, with the expectation of making the south bank of the</p>
<p>main Canathan and there passing the night, as Clark assured me that</p>
<p>timber was plentiful on that side of the river.  The storm greatly</p>
<p>impeded us, however, many of the mules growing discouraged, and some</p>
<p>giving out entirely, so we could not get to Clark&#x27;s &quot;good camp,&quot; for</p>
<p>with ten hours of utmost effort only about half a day&#x27;s distance</p>
<p>could be covered, when at last, finding the struggle useless, we were</p>
<p>forced to halt for the night in a bleak bottom on the north bank of</p>
<p>the river.  But no one could sleep, for the wind swept over us with</p>
<p>unobstructed fury, and the only fuel to be had was a few green</p>
<p>bushes.  As night fell a decided change of temperature added much to</p>
<p>our misery, the mercury, which had risen when the &quot;Norther&quot; began,</p>
<p>again falling to zero.  It can be easily imagined that under such</p>
<p>circumstances the condition of the men was one of extreme discomfort;</p>
<p>in truth, they had to tramp up and down the camp all night long to</p>
<p>keep from freezing.  Anything was a relief to this state of things,</p>
<p>so at the first streak of day we quit the dreadful place and took up</p>
<p>the march.</p>
<p>A seemingly good point for crossing the Canadian was found a couple</p>
<p>of miles down the stream, where we hoped to get our train over on the</p>
<p>ice, but an experiment proving that it was not strong enough, a ford</p>
<p>had to be made, which was done by marching some of the cavalry</p>
<p>through the river, which was about half a mile wide, to break up the</p>
<p>large floes when they had been cut loose with axes.  After much hard</p>
<p>work a passage-way was thus opened, and by noon the command was</p>
<p>crossed to the south bank, and after thawing out and drying our</p>
<p>clothes before big fires, we headed for a point on the Washita, where</p>
<p>Clark said there was plenty of wood, and good water too, to make us</p>
<p>comfortable till the blizzard had blown over.</p>
<p>We reached the valley of the Washita a little before dark, and camped</p>
<p>some five or six miles above the scene of Custer&#x27;s fight, where I</p>
<p>concluded to remain at least a day, to rest the command and give it a</p>
<p>chance to refit.  In the mean time I visited the battle-field in</p>
<p>company with Custer and several other officers, to see if there was a</p>
<p>possibility of discovering any traces of Elliotts party.  On arriving</p>
<p>at the site of the village, and learning from Custer what</p>
<p>dispositions had been made in approaching for the attack, the</p>
<p>squadron of the escort was deployed and pushed across the river at</p>
<p>the point where Elliott had crossed.  Moving directly to the south,</p>
<p>we had not gone far before we struck his trail, and soon the whole</p>
<p>story was made plain by our finding, on an open level space about two</p>
<p>miles from the destroyed village, the dead and frozen bodies of the</p>
<p>entire party.  The poor fellows were all lying within a circle not</p>
<p>more than fifteen or twenty paces in diameter, and the little piles</p>
<p>of empty cartridge shells near each body showed plainly that every</p>
<p>man had made a brave fight.  None were scalped, but most of them were</p>
<p>otherwise horribly mutilated, which fiendish work is usually done by</p>
<p>the squaws.  All had been stripped of their clothing, but their</p>
<p>comrades in the escort were able to identify the bodies, which being</p>
<p>done, we gave them decent burial.  Their fate was one that has</p>
<p>overtaken many of our gallant army in their efforts to protect the</p>
<p>frontiersmen&#x27;s homes and families from savages who give no quarter,</p>
<p>though they have often received it, and where the possibility of</p>
<p>defeat in action carries with it the certainty of death and often of</p>
<p>preceding torture.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the meadow where Elliott was found we rode to the Washita, and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then down the river through the sites of the abandoned villages, that</p>
<p>had been strung along almost continuously for about twelve miles in</p>
<p>the timber skirting the stream.  On every hand appeared ample</p>
<p>evidence that the Indians had intended to spend the winter here, for</p>
<p>the ground was littered with jerked meat, bales of buffalo robes,</p>
<p>cooking utensils, and all sorts of plunder usually accumulated in a</p>
<p>permanent Indian camp.  There were, also, lying dead near the</p>
<p>villages hundreds of ponies, that had been shot to keep them from</p>
<p>falling into our hands, the scant grazing and extreme cold having</p>
<p>made them too weak to be driven along in the flight.  The wholesale</p>
<p>slaughter of these ponies was a most cheering indication that our</p>
<p>campaign would be ultimately successful, and we all prayed for at</p>
<p>least a couple of months more of cold weather and plenty of snow.</p>
<p>At the Kiowa village we found the body of a white woman--a Mrs.</p>
<p>Blynn--and also that of her child.  These captives had been taken by</p>
<p>the Kiowas near Fort Lyon the previous summer, and kept close</p>
<p>prisoners until the stampede began, the poor woman being reserved to</p>
<p>gratify the brutal lust of the chief, Satanta; then, however, Indian</p>
<p>vengeance demanded the murder of the poor creatures, and after</p>
<p>braining the little child against a tree, the mother was shot through</p>
<p>the forehead, the weapon, which no doubt brought her welcome release,</p>
<p>having been fired so close that the powder had horribly disfigured</p>
<p>her face.  The two bodies were wrapped in blankets and taken to camp,</p>
<p>and afterward carried along in our march, till finally they were</p>
<p>decently interred at Fort Arbuckle..</p>
<p>At an early hour on December 12 the command pulled out from its cosy</p>
<p>camp and pushed down the valley of the Washita, following immediately</p>
<p>on the Indian trail which led in the direction of Fort Cobb, but</p>
<p>before going far it was found that the many deep ravines and canyons</p>
<p>on this trail would delay our train very much, so we moved out of the</p>
<p>valley and took the level prairie on the divide.  Here the traveling</p>
<p>was good, and a rapid gait was kept up till mid-day, when, another</p>
<p>storm of sleet and snow coming on, it became extremely difficult for</p>
<p>the guides to make out the proper course; and fearing that we might</p>
<p>get lost or caught on the open plain without wood or water--as we had</p>
<p>been on the Canadian--I turned the command back to the valley,</p>
<p>resolved to try no more shortcuts involving the risk of a disaster to</p>
<p>the expedition.  But to get back was no slight task, for a dense fog</p>
<p>just now enveloped us, obscuring all landmarks.  However, we were</p>
<p>headed right when the fog set in, and we had the good luck to reach</p>
<p>the valley before night-fall, though there was a great deal of</p>
<p>floundering about, and also much disputing among the guides as to</p>
<p>where the river would be found Fortunately we struck the stream right</p>
<p>at a large grove of timber, and established ourselves, admirably.  By</p>
<p>dark the ground was covered with twelve or fifteen inches of fresh</p>
<p>snow, and as usual the temperature rose very sensibly while the storm</p>
<p>was on, but after night-fall the snow ceased and the skies cleared</p>
<p>up.  Daylight having brought zero weather again, our start on the</p>
<p>morning of the 17th was painful work, many of the men freezing their</p>
<p>fingers while handling the horse equipments, harness, and tents.</p>
<p>However, we got off in fairly good season, and kept to the trail</p>
<p>along the Washita notwithstanding the frequent digging and bridging</p>
<p>necessary to get the wagons over ravines.</p>
<p>Continuing on this line for three days, we at length came to a point</p>
<p>on the Washita where all signs indicated that we were nearing some of</p>
<p>the villages.  Wishing to strike them as soon as possible, we made a</p>
<p>very early start next morning, the 17th.  A march of four or five</p>
<p>miles brought us to a difficult ravine, and while we were making</p>
<p>preparations to get over, word was brought that several Indians had</p>
<p>appeared in our front bearing a white flag and making signs that they</p>
<p>had a communication to deliver.  We signaled back that they would be</p>
<p>received, when one of the party came forward alone and delivered a</p>
<p>letter, which proved to be from General Hazen, at Fort Cobb.  The</p>
<p>letter showed that Hazen was carrying on negotiations with the</p>
<p>Indians, and stated that all the tribes between Fort Cobb and my</p>
<p>column were friendly , but the intimation was given that the</p>
<p>Cheyennes and Arapahoes were still hostile, having moved off</p>
<p>southward toward, the Red River.  It was added that Satanta and Lone</p>
<p>Wolf--the chiefs of the Kiowas--would give information of the</p>
<p>whereabouts of the hostiles; and such a communication coming direct</p>
<p>from the representative of the Indian Department, practically took</p>
<p>the Kiowas--the village at hand was of that tribe--under its</p>
<p>protection, and also the Comanches, who were nearer in to Cobb.  Of</p>
<p>course, under such circumstances I was compelled to give up the</p>
<p>intended attack, though I afterward regretted that I had paid any</p>
<p>heed to the message, because Satanta and Lone Wolf proved, by</p>
<p>trickery and double dealing, that they had deceived Hazen into</p>
<p>writing the letter.</p>
<p>When I informed the Klowas that I would respect Hazen&#x27;s letter</p>
<p>provided they all came into Fort Cobb and gave themselves up, the two</p>
<p>chiefs promised submission, and, as an evidence of good faith,</p>
<p>proposed to accompany the column to Fort Cobb with a large body of</p>
<p>warriors, while their villages moved to the same point by easy</p>
<p>stages, along the opposite bank of the river--claiming this to be</p>
<p>necessary from the poor condition of the ponies.  I had some</p>
<p>misgivings as to the sincerity of Satanta and Lone Wolf, but as I</p>
<p>wanted to get the Kiowas where their surrender would be complete, so</p>
<p>that the Cheyennes and Arapahoes could then be pursued, I agreed to</p>
<p>the proposition, and the column moved on.  All went well that day,</p>
<p>but the next it was noticed that the warriors were diminishing, and</p>
<p>an investigation showed that a number of them had gone off on various</p>
<p>pretexts--the main one being to help along the women and children</p>
<p>with the villages.  With this I suspected that they were playing me</p>
<p>false, and my suspicions grew into certainty when Satanta himself</p>
<p>tried to make his escape by slipping beyond the flank of the column</p>
<p>and putting spurs to his pony.  Fortunately, several officers saw</p>
<p>him, and quickly giving chase, overhauled him within a few hundred</p>
<p>yards.  I then arrested both him and Lone Wolf and held them as</p>
<p>hostages--a measure that had the effect of bringing back many of the</p>
<p>warriors already beyond our reach.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Fort Cobb we found some of the Comanches already</p>
<p>there, and soon after the rest.  of them, excepting one band, came in</p>
<p>to the post.  The Kiowas, however, were not on hand, and there were</p>
<p>no signs to indicate their coming.  At the end of two days it was</p>
<p>plain enough that they were acting in bad faith, and would continue</p>
<p>to unless strong pressure was brought to bear.  Indeed, they had</p>
<p>already started for the Witchita Mountains, so I put on the screws at</p>
<p>once by issuing an order to hang Satanta and Lone Wolf, if their</p>
<p>people did not surrender at Fort Cobb within forty-eight hours.  The</p>
<p>two chiefs promised prompt compliance, but begged for more time,</p>
<p>seeking to explain the non-arrival of the women and children through</p>
<p>the weak condition of the ponies; but I was tired of their duplicity,</p>
<p>and insisted on my ultimatum.</p>
<p>The order for the execution brought quick fruit.  Runners were sent</p>
<p>out with messages, by the two prisoners, appealing to their people to</p>
<p>save the lives of their chiefs, and the result was that the whole</p>
<p>tribe came in to the post within the specified time.  The two</p>
<p>manacled wretches thus saved their necks; but it is to be regretted</p>
<p>that the execution did not come off; for some years afterward their</p>
<p>devilish propensities led them into Texas, where both engaged in the</p>
<p>most horrible butcheries.</p>
<p>The Kiowas were now in our hands, and all the Comanches too, except</p>
<p>one small band, which, after the Custer fight, had fled toward the</p>
<p>headwaters of the Red River.  This party was made up of a lot of very</p>
<p>bad Indians--outlaws from the main tribe--and we did not hope to</p>
<p>subdue them except by a fight, and of this they got their fill; for</p>
<p>Evans, moving from Monument Creek toward the western base of the</p>
<p>Witchita Mountains on Christmas Day, had the good fortune to strike</p>
<p>their village.  In the snow and cold his approach was wholly</p>
<p>unexpected, and he was thus enabled to deal the band a blow that</p>
<p>practically annihilated it.  Twenty-five warriors were killed</p>
<p>outright, most of the women and children captured, and all the</p>
<p>property was destroyed.  Only a few of the party escaped, and some of</p>
<p>these made their way in to Fort Cobb, to join the rest of their tribe</p>
<p>in confinement; while others, later in the season, surrendered at</p>
<p>Fort Bascom.</p>
<p>This sudden appearance of Evans in the Red River region also alarmed</p>
<p>the Cheyennes and Arapahoes, and their thoughts now began to turn to</p>
<p>submission.  Food was growing scarce with them, too, as there was but</p>
<p>little game to be found either in the Witchita Mountains or on the</p>
<p>edge of the Staked Plains, and the march of Carr&#x27;s column from</p>
<p>Antelope Hills precluded their returning to where the buffalo ranged.</p>
<p>Then, too, many of their ponies were dead or dying, most of their</p>
<p>tepees and robes had been abandoned, and the women and children,</p>
<p>having been kept constantly on the move in the winter&#x27;s storms, were</p>
<p>complaining bitterly of their sufferings.</p>
<p>In view of this state of things they intimated, through their</p>
<p>Comanche-Apache friends at Fort Cobb, that they would like to make</p>
<p>terms.  On receiving their messages I entered into negotiations with</p>
<p>Little Robe, chief of the Cheyennes, and Yellow Bear, chief of the</p>
<p>Arapahoes, and despatched envoys to have both tribes understand</p>
<p>clearly that they must recognize their subjugation by surrendering at</p>
<p>once, and permanently settling on their reservations in the spring.</p>
<p>Of course the usual delays of Indian diplomacy ensued, and it was</p>
<p>some weeks before I heard the result.</p>
<p>Then one of my messengers returned with word that Little Robe and</p>
<p>Yellow Bear were on their way to see me.  They arrived a few days</p>
<p>later, and, promptly acceding to the terms, promised to bring their</p>
<p>people in, but as many of them would have to come on foot on account</p>
<p>of the condition of the ponies, more time was solicited.  Convinced</p>
<p>of the sincerity of their professions I gave them a reasonable</p>
<p>extension, and eventually Yellow Bear made good his word, but Little</p>
<p>Robe, in spite of earnest and repeated efforts, was unable to deliver</p>
<p>his people till further operations were begun against them.</p>
<p>While these negotiations were in progess I came to the conclusion</p>
<p>that a permanent military post ought to be established well down on</p>
<p>the Kiowa and Comanche reservation, in order to keep an eye on these</p>
<p>tribes in the future, Fort Cobb, being an unsuitable location,</p>
<p>because too far to the north to protect the Texas frontier, and too</p>
<p>far away from where it was intended to permanently place the Indians.</p>
<p>With this purpose in view I had the country thoroughly explored, and</p>
<p>afterward a place was fixed upon not far from the base of the</p>
<p>Witchita Mountains, and near the confluence of Medicine Bluff and</p>
<p>Cash creeks, where building stone and timber could be obtained in</p>
<p>plenty, and to this point I decided to move.  The place was named</p>
<p>Camp Sill-now Fort Sill--in honor of my classmate, General Sill,</p>
<p>killed at Stone River; and to make sure of the surrendered Indians, I</p>
<p>required them all, Kiowas, Comanches, and Comanche-Apaches, to</p>
<p>accompany us to the new post, so they could be kept under military</p>
<p>control till they were settled.</p>
<p>During the march to the new camp the weather was not so cold as that</p>
<p>experienced in coming down from Camp Supply; still, rains were</p>
<p>frequent, and each was invariably followed by a depression of</p>
<p>temperature and high winds, very destructive to our animals, much</p>
<p>weakened by lack of food.  The men fared pretty well, however, for on</p>
<p>the rough march along the Washita, and during our stay at Fort Cobb,</p>
<p>they had learned to protect themselves materially from the cold.  For</p>
<p>this they had contrived many devices, the favorite means being</p>
<p>dugouts--that is, pits dug in the ground, and roofed over, with</p>
<p>shelter-tents, and having at one end a fire-place and chimney</p>
<p>ingeniously constructed with sod.  In these they lived very snugly--</p>
<p>four men in each--and would often amuse themselves by poking their</p>
<p>heads out and barking at the occupants of adjacent huts in imitation</p>
<p>of the prairie-dog, whose comfortable nests had probably suggested</p>
<p>the idea of dugouts.  The men were much better off, in fact, than</p>
<p>many of the officers, for the high winds frequently made havoc with</p>
<p>our wall-tents.  The horses and mules suffered most of all.  They</p>
<p>could not be sheltered, and having neither grain nor grass, the poor</p>
<p>beasts were in no condition to stand the chilling blasts.  Still, by</p>
<p>cutting down cottonwood-trees, and letting the animals browse on the</p>
<p>small soft branches, we managed to keep them up till, finally even</p>
<p>this wretched food beginning to grow scarce, I had all except a few</p>
<p>of the strongest sent to Fort Arbuckle, near which place we had been</p>
<p>able, fortunately, to purchase some fields of corn from the half-</p>
<p>civilized Chickasaws and Choctaws.</p>
<p>Through mismanagement, as previously noted, the greater part of the</p>
<p>supplies which I had ordered hauled to Arbuckle the preceding fall</p>
<p>had not got farther on the way than Fort Gibson, which post was about</p>
<p>four hundred miles off, and the road abominable, particularly east of</p>
<p>Arbuckle, where it ran through a low region called &quot;boggy bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>All along this route were abandoned wagons, left sticking in the mud,</p>
<p>and hence the transportation was growing so short that I began to</p>
<p>fear trouble in getting subsistence up for the men.  Still, it would</p>
<p>not do to withdraw, so I made a trip to Arbuckle chiefly for the</p>
<p>purpose of reorganizing the transportation, but also with a view to</p>
<p>opening a new route to that post, the road to lie on high ground, so</p>
<p>as to avoid the creeks and mud that had been giving us so much</p>
<p>trouble.  If such a road could be made, I hoped to get up enough</p>
<p>rations and grain from the cornfields purchased to send out a</p>
<p>formidable expedition against the Cheyennes, so I set out for</p>
<p>Arbuckle accompanied by my quartermaster, Colonel A. J. McGonigle.</p>
<p>&quot;California Joe&quot; also went along to guide us through the scrub-oaks</p>
<p>covering the ridge, but even the most thorough exploration failed to</p>
<p>discover any route more practicable than that already in use; indeed,</p>
<p>the high ground was, if anything, worse than the bottom land, our</p>
<p>horses in the springy places and quicksands often miring to their</p>
<p>knees.  The ground was so soft and wet, in fact, that we had to make</p>
<p>most of the way on foot, so by the time we reached Arbuckle I was</p>
<p>glad to abandon the new road project.</p>
<p>Finding near Arbuckle more fields of corn than those already</p>
<p>purchased, I had them bought also, and ordered more of the horses</p>
<p>back there to be fed.  I next directed every available mule to be put</p>
<p>to hauling rations, having discovered that the full capacity of the</p>
<p>transportation had not yet been brought into play in forwarding</p>
<p>stores from Gibson, and with this regulation of the supply question I</p>
<p>was ready to return immediately to Camp Sill.  But my departure was</p>
<p>delayed by California Joe, who, notwithstanding the prohibitory laws</p>
<p>of the Territory, in some unaccountable way had got gloriously tipsy,</p>
<p>which caused a loss of time that disgusted me greatly; but as we</p>
<p>could not well do without Joe, I put off starting till the next day,</p>
<p>by which time it was thought he would sober up.  But I might just as</p>
<p>well have gone at first, for at the end of the twenty-four hours the</p>
<p>incorrigible old rascal was still dead drunk.  How he had managed to</p>
<p>get the grog to keep up his spree was a mystery which we could not</p>
<p>solve, though we had had him closely watched, so I cut the matter</p>
<p>short by packing him into my ambulance and carrying him off to Camp</p>
<p>Sill.</p>
<p>By the time I got back to Sill, the Arapahoes were all in at the</p>
<p>post, or near at hand.  The promised surrender of the Cheyennes was</p>
<p>still uncertain of fulfillment, however, and although Little Robe and</p>
<p>his family had remained with us in evidence of good faith, the</p>
<p>messages he sent to his followers brought no assurance of the tribe&#x27;s</p>
<p>coming in--the runners invariably returning with requests for more</p>
<p>time, and bringing the same old excuse of inability to move because</p>
<p>the ponies were so badly off.  But more time was just what I was</p>
<p>determined not to grant, for I felt sure that if a surrender was not</p>
<p>forced before the spring grass came, the ponies would regain their</p>
<p>strength, and then it would be doubtful if the Cheyennes came in at</p>
<p>all.</p>
<p>To put an end to these delays, Custer proposed to go out and see the</p>
<p>Cheyennes himself, taking with him for escort only such number of men</p>
<p>as could be fairly well mounted from the few horses not sent back to</p>
<p>Arbuckle.  At first I was inclined to disapprove Custer&#x27;s</p>
<p>proposition, but he urged it so strongly that I finally consented,</p>
<p>though with some misgivings, for I feared that so small a party might</p>
<p>tempt the Cheyennes to forget their pacific professions and seek to</p>
<p>avenge the destruction of Black Kettle&#x27;s band.  However, after</p>
<p>obtaining my approval, Custer, with characteristic energy, made his</p>
<p>preparations, and started with three or four officers and forty</p>
<p>picked men, taking along as negotiators Yellow Bear and Little Robe,</p>
<p>who were also to conduct him to the head-waters of the Red River,</p>
<p>where it was supposed the Cheyennes would be found.  His progress was</p>
<p>reported by couriers every few days, and by the time he got to the</p>
<p>Witchita foot-hills he had grown so sanguine that he sent California</p>
<p>Joe back to me with word that he was certain of success.  Such</p>
<p>hopeful anticipation relieved me greatly, of course, but just about</p>
<p>the time I expected to hear that his mission had been achieved I was</p>
<p>astonished by the party&#x27;s return.  Inquiring as to the trouble, I</p>
<p>learned that out toward the Staked Plains every sign of the Cheyennes</p>
<p>had disappeared.  Surprised and disappointed at this, and discouraged</p>
<p>by the loneliness of his situation--for in the whole region not a</p>
<p>trace of animal life was visible, Custer gave up the search, and none</p>
<p>too soon, I am inclined to believe, to save his small party from</p>
<p>perishing.</p>
<p>This failure put a stop to all expeditions till the latter part of</p>
<p>February, by which time I had managed to lay in enough rations to</p>
<p>feed the command for about thirty days; and the horses back at</p>
<p>Arbuckle having picked up sufficiently for field service they were</p>
<p>ordered to Sill, and this time I decided to send Custer out with his</p>
<p>own and the Kansas regiment, with directions to insist on the</p>
<p>immediate surrender of the Cheyennes, or give them a sound thrashing.</p>
<p>He was ordered to get everything ready by March 1, and then move to</p>
<p>the mouth of Salt Creek, on the North Fork of the Red River, at which</p>
<p>place I proposed to establish a new depot for feeding the command.</p>
<p>Trains could reach this point from Camp Supply more readily than from</p>
<p>Arbuckle, and wishing to arrange this part of the programme in</p>
<p>person, I decided to return at once to Supply, and afterward rejoin</p>
<p>Custer at Salt Creek, on what, I felt sure, was to be the final</p>
<p>expedition of the campaign.  I made the three hundred and sixty miles</p>
<p>from Sill to Supply in seven days, but much to my surprise there</p>
<p>found a despatch from General Grant directing me to repair</p>
<p>immediately to Washington.  These orders precluded, of course, my</p>
<p>rejoining the command; but at the appointed time it set out on the</p>
<p>march, and within three weeks brought the campaign to a successful</p>
<p>close.</p>
<p>In this last expedition, for the first few days Custer&#x27;s route was by</p>
<p>the same trail he had taken in January--that is to say, along the</p>
<p>southern base of the Witchita Mountains--but this time there was more</p>
<p>to encourage him than before, for, on getting a couple of marches</p>
<p>beyond old Camp Radziminski, on all sides were fresh evidences of</p>
<p>Indians, and every effort was bent to strike them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From day to day the signs grew hotter, and toward the latter part of</p>
</blockquote>
<p>March the game was found.  The Indians being in a very forlorn</p>
<p>condition, Custer might have destroyed most of the tribe, and</p>
<p>certainly all their villages, but in order to save two white women</p>
<p>whom, it was discovered, they held as captives, he contented himself</p>
<p>with the renewal of the Cheyennes&#x27; agreement to come in to Camp</p>
<p>Supply.  In due time the entire tribe fulfilled its promise except</p>
<p>one small band under &quot;Tall Bull,&quot; but this party received a good</p>
<p>drubbing from General Carr on the Republican early in May.  After</p>
<p>this fight all the Indians of the southern Plains settled down on</p>
<p>their reservations, and I doubt whether the peace would ever again</p>
<p>have been broken had they not in after years been driven to</p>
<p>hostilities by most unjust treatment.</p>
<p>It was the 2d of March that I received at Camp Supply Grant&#x27;s</p>
<p>despatch directing me to report immediately in Washington.  It had</p>
<p>been my intention, as I have said, to join Custer on the North Fork</p>
<p>of the Red River, but this new order required me to recast my plans,</p>
<p>so, after arranging to keep the expedition supplied till the end of</p>
<p>the campaign, I started for Washington, accompanied by three of my</p>
<p>staff--Colonels McGonigle and Crosby, and Surgeon Asch, and Mr. DeB.</p>
<p>Randolph Keim, a representative of the press, who went through the</p>
<p>whole campaign, and in 1870 published a graphic history of it.  The</p>
<p>day we left Supply we, had another dose of sleet and snow, but</p>
<p>nevertheless we made good time, and by night-fall reached Bluff</p>
<p>Creek.  In twenty-four hours more we made Fort Dodge, and on the 6th</p>
<p>of March arrived at Fort Hays.  Just south of the Smoky Hill River, a</p>
<p>little before we got to the post, a courier heading for Fort Dodge</p>
<p>passed us at a rapid gait.  Suspecting that he had despatches for me,</p>
<p>I directed my outrider to overtake him and find out.  The courier</p>
<p>soon turned back, and riding up to my ambulance handed me a telegram</p>
<p>notifying me that General Grant, on the day of his inauguration,</p>
<p>March 4, 1869, had appointed me Lieutenant-General of the Army.  When</p>
<p>I reported in Washington, the President desired me to return to New</p>
<p>Orleans and resume command of the Fifth Military District, but this</p>
<p>was not at all to my liking, so I begged off, and was assigned to</p>
<p>take charge of the Division of the Missouri, succeeding General</p>
<p>Sherman, who had just been ordered to assume command of the Army.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
<p>INSPECTING MILITARY POSTS IN UTAH AND MONTANA--DESIRE TO WITNESS THE</p>
<p>FRANCO-GERMAN WAR--ON A SAND-BAR IN THE MISSOURI--A BEAR HUNT--AN</p>
<p>INDIAN SCARE--MYRIADS OF MOSQUITOES--PERMISSION GIVEN TO VISIT</p>
<p>EUROPE--CALLING ON PRESIDENT GRANT--SAILING FOR LIVERPOOL--ARRIVAL IN</p>
<p>BERLIN.</p>
<p>After I had for a year been commanding the Division of the Missouri,</p>
<p>which embraced the entire Rocky Mountain region, I found it necessary</p>
<p>to make an inspection of the military posts in northern Utah and</p>
<p>Montana, in order by personal observation to inform myself of their</p>
<p>location and needs, and at the same time become acquainted with the</p>
<p>salient geographical and topographical features of that section of my</p>
<p>division.  Therefore in May, 1870, I started west by the Union-</p>
<p>Pacific railroad, and on arriving at Corinne&#x27; Station, the next</p>
<p>beyond Ogden, took passage by stage-coach for Helena, the capital of</p>
<p>Montana Territory.  Helena is nearly five hundred miles north of</p>
<p>Corinne, and under ordinary conditions the journey was, in those</p>
<p>days, a most tiresome one.  As the stage kept jogging on day and</p>
<p>night, there was little chance for sleep, and there being with me a</p>
<p>sufficient number of staff-officers to justify the proceeding, we</p>
<p>chartered the &quot;outfit,&quot; stipulating that we were to stop over one</p>
<p>night on the road to get some rest.  This rendered the journey more</p>
<p>tolerable, and we arrived at Helena without extraordinary fatigue.</p>
<p>Before I left Chicago the newspapers were filled with rumors of</p>
<p>impending war between Germany and France.  I was anxious to observe</p>
<p>the conflict, if it was to occur, but reports made one day concerning</p>
<p>the beginning of hostilities would be contradicted the next, and it</p>
<p>was not till I reached Helena that the despatches lost their doubtful</p>
<p>character, and later became of so positive a nature as to make it</p>
<p>certain that the two nations would fight.  I therefore decided to cut</p>
<p>short my tour of inspection, so that I could go abroad to witness the</p>
<p>war, if the President would approve.  This resolution limited my stay</p>
<p>in Helena to a couple of days, which were devoted to arranging for an</p>
<p>exploration of what are now known as the Upper and the Lower Geyser</p>
<p>Basins of the Yellowstone Park.  While journeying between Corinne and</p>
<p>Helena I had gained some vague knowledge of these geysers from an old</p>
<p>mountaineer named Atkinson, but his information was very indefinite,</p>
<p>mostly second-hand; and there was such general uncertainty as to the</p>
<p>character of this wonderland that I authorized an escort of soldiers</p>
<p>to go that season from Fort Ellis with a small party, to make such</p>
<p>superficial explorations as to justify my sending an engineer officer</p>
<p>with a well-equipped expedition there next summer to scientifically</p>
<p>examine and report upon the strange country.  When the arrangements</p>
<p>for this preliminary expedition were completed I started for Fort</p>
<p>Benton, the head of navigation on the Missouri River, on the way</p>
<p>passing through Fort Shaw, on Sun River.  I expected to take at</p>
<p>Benton a steamboat to Fort Stevenson, a military post which had been</p>
<p>established about eighty miles south of Fort Buford, near a</p>
<p>settlement of friendly Mandan and Arickaree Indians, to protect them</p>
<p>from the hosiile Sioux.  From there I was to make my way overland,</p>
<p>first to Fort Totten near Devil&#x27;s lake in Dakota, and thence by way</p>
<p>of Fort Abercrombie to Saint Cloud, Minnesota, the terminus of the</p>
<p>rallroad.</p>
<p>Luckily I met with no delay in getting a boat at Benton, and though</p>
<p>the water was extremely low, we steamed down the channel of the</p>
<p>Missouri with but slight detention till we got within fifty miles of</p>
<p>Fort Buford.  Here we struck on a sandbar with such force of steam</p>
<p>and current as to land us almost out of the water from stem to</p>
<p>midships.  This bad luck was tantalizing, for to land on a bar when</p>
<p>your boat is under full headway down-stream in the Missouri River is</p>
<p>no trifling matter, especially if you want to make time, for the</p>
<p>rapid and turbid stream quickly depositing sand under the hull, makes</p>
<p>it commonly a task of several days to get your boat off again.  As</p>
<p>from our mishap the loss of much time was inevitable, I sent a</p>
<p>messenger to Fort Buford for a small escort, and for horses to take</p>
<p>my party in to the post.  Colonel Morrow, the commandant, came</p>
<p>himself to meet us, bringing a strong party of soldiers and some</p>
<p>friendly Indian scouts, because, he said, there were then in the</p>
<p>region around Buford so many treacherous band of Sioux as to make</p>
<p>things exceedingly unsafe.</p>
<p>Desiring to reach the post without spending more than one night on</p>
<p>the way, we abandoned our steamer that evening, and set off at an</p>
<p>early hour the next morning.  We made camp at the end of the day&#x27;s</p>
<p>march within ten miles of Buford, and arrived at the post without</p>
<p>having had any incident of moment, unless we may dignify as one a</p>
<p>battle with three grizzly bears, discovered by our friendly Indians</p>
<p>the morning of our second day&#x27;s journey.  While eating our breakfast-</p>
<p>-a rather slim one, by the way--spread on a piece of canvas, the</p>
<p>Indians, whose bivouac was some distance off, began shouting</p>
<p>excitedly, &quot;Bear! bear!&quot; and started us all up in time to see, out on</p>
<p>the plain some hundreds of yards away, an enormous grizzly and two</p>
<p>almost full-grown cubs.  Chances like this for a bear hunt seldom</p>
<p>offered, so there was hurried mounting--the horses being already</p>
<p>saddled--and a quick advance made on the game from many directions,</p>
<p>Lieutenant Townsend, of the escort, and five or six of the Indians</p>
<p>going with me.  Alarmed by the commotion, bruin and her cubs turned</p>
<p>about, and with an awkward yet rapid gait headed for a deep ravine,</p>
<p>in which there was brushwood shelter.</p>
<p>My party rode directly across the prairie and struck the trail not</p>
<p>far behind the game.  Then for a mile or more the chase was kept up,</p>
<p>but with such poor shooting because of the &quot;buck fever&quot; which had</p>
<p>seized most of us, that we failed to bring down any of the grizzlies,</p>
<p>though the cubs grew so tired that the mother was often obliged to</p>
<p>halt for their defense, meanwhile urging them on before her.  When</p>
<p>the ravine was gained she hid the cubs away in the thick brushwood,</p>
<p>and then coming out where we could plainly see her, stood on the</p>
<p>defense just within the edge of the thicket, beyond the range of our</p>
<p>rifles though, unless we went down into the canyon, which we would</p>
<p>have to do on foot, since the precipitous wall precluded going on</p>
<p>horseback.  For an adventure like this I confess I had little</p>
<p>inclination, and on holding a council of war, I found that the</p>
<p>Indians had still less, but Lieutenant Townsend, who was a fine shot,</p>
<p>and had refrained from firing hitherto in the hope that I might bag</p>
<p>the game, relieved the embarrassing situation and saved the credit of</p>
<p>the party by going down alone to attack the enemy.  Meanwhile I</p>
<p>magnanimously held his horse, and the Sioux braves did a deal of</p>
<p>shouting, which they seemed to think of great assistance.</p>
<p>Townsend, having descended to the bottom of the ravine, approached</p>
<p>within range, when the old bear struck out, dashing into and out of</p>
<p>the bushes so rapidly, however, that he could not get fair aim at</p>
<p>her, but the startled cubs running into full view, he killed one at</p>
<p>the first shot and at the second wounded the other.  This terribly</p>
<p>enraged the mother, and she now came boldly out to fight, exposing</p>
<p>herself in the open ground so much as to permit a shot, that brought</p>
<p>her down too, with a broken shoulder.  Then the Indians and I,</p>
<p>growing very brave, scrambled down to--take part in the fight.  It</p>
<p>was left for me to despatch the wounded cub and mother, and having</p>
<p>recovered possession of my nerves, I did the work effectively, and we</p>
<p>carried off with us the skins of the three animals as trophies of the</p>
<p>hunt and evidence of our prowess.</p>
<p>As good luck would have it, when we reached Buford we found a</p>
<p>steamboat there unloading stores, and learned that it would be ready</p>
<p>to start down the river the next day.  Embarking on her, we got to</p>
<p>Stevenson in a few hours, and finding at the post camp equipage that</p>
<p>had been made ready for our use in crossing overland to Fort Totten,</p>
<p>we set out the following forenoon, taking with us a small escort of</p>
<p>infantry, transported in two light wagons, a couple of Mandans and</p>
<p>the post interpreter going along as mounted guides.</p>
<p>To reach water we had to march the first day to a small lake forty</p>
<p>miles off, and the oppressive heat, together with the long distance</p>
<p>traveled, used up one of the teams so much that, when about to start</p>
<p>out the second morning, we found the animals unable to go on with any</p>
<p>prospect of finishing the trip, so I ordered them to be rested forty-</p>
<p>eight hours longer, and then taken back to Stevenson.  This</p>
<p>diminished the escort by one-half, yet by keeping the Indians and</p>
<p>interpreter on the lookout, and seeing that our ambulance was kept</p>
<p>closed up on the wagon carrying the rest of the detachment, we could,</p>
<p>I thought, stand off any ordinary party of hostile Indians.</p>
<p>About noon I observed that the scouts in advance had left the trail</p>
<p>and begun to reconnoitre a low ridge to their right, the sequel of</p>
<p>which was that in a few minutes they returned to the wagons on a dead</p>
<p>run and reported Sioux just ahead.  Looking in the direction</p>
<p>indicated, I could dimly see five or six horsemen riding in a circle,</p>
<p>as Indians do when giving warning to their camp, but as our halt</p>
<p>disclosed that we were aware of their proximity, they darted back</p>
<p>again behind the crest of the ridge.  Anticipating from this move an</p>
<p>immediate attack, we hastily prepared for it by unhooking the mules</p>
<p>from the wagon and ambulance, so that we could use the vehicles as a</p>
<p>barricade.  This done, I told the interpreter to take the Mandan</p>
<p>scouts and go over toward the ridge and reconnoitre again.  As the</p>
<p>scouts neared the crest two of them dismounted, and, crawling slowly</p>
<p>on their bellies to the summit, took a hasty look and returned at</p>
<p>once to their horses, coming back with word that in the valley beyond</p>
<p>was a camp of at least a hundred Sioux lodges, and that the Indians</p>
<p>were hurriedly getting ready to attack us.  The news was anything but</p>
<p>cheering, for with a village of that size the warriors would number</p>
<p>two or three hundred, and could assail us from every side.</p>
<p>Still, nothing could be done, but stand and take what was to come,</p>
<p>for there was no chance of escape--it being supreme folly to</p>
<p>undertake in wagons a race with Indians to Fort Stevenson, sixty</p>
<p>miles away.  To make the best of the situation, we unloaded the</p>
<p>baggage, distributing and adjusting the trunks, rolls of bedding,</p>
<p>crackerboxes, and everything else that would stop a bullet, in such</p>
<p>manner as to form a square barricade, two sides of which were the</p>
<p>wagons, with the mules haltered to the wheels.  Every man then</p>
<p>supplied himself with all the ammunition he could carry, and the</p>
<p>Mandan scouts setting up the depressing wail of the Indian death-</p>
<p>song, we all awaited the attack with the courage of despair.</p>
<p>But no attack came; and time slipping by, and we still unmolested,</p>
<p>the interpreter and scouts were sent out to make another</p>
<p>reconnoissance.  Going through just such precautions as before in</p>
<p>approaching the ridge, their slow progress kept us in painful</p>
<p>suspense; but when they got to the crest the strain on our herves was</p>
<p>relieved by seeing them first stand up boldly at full height, and</p>
<p>then descend beyond.  Quickly returning, they brought welcome word</p>
<p>that the whole thing was a mistake, and no Sioux were there at all.</p>
<p>What had been taken for a hundred Indian lodges turned out to be the</p>
<p>camp of a Government train on its way to Fort Stevenson, and the</p>
<p>officer in charge seeing the scouts before they discovered him, and</p>
<p>believing them to be Sioux, had sent out to bring his herds in.  It</p>
<p>would be hard to exaggerate the relief that this discovery gave us,</p>
<p>and we all breathed much easier.  The scare was a bad one, and I have</p>
<p>no hesitation in saying that, had we been mounted, it is more than</p>
<p>likely that, instead of showing fight, we would have taken up a</p>
<p>lively pace for Fort Stevenson.</p>
<p>After reciprocal explanations with the officer in charge of the</p>
<p>train, the march was resumed, and at the close of that day we camped</p>
<p>near a small lake about twenty miles from Fort Totten.  From Totten</p>
<p>we journeyed on to Fort Abercrombie.  The country between the two</p>
<p>posts is low and flat, and I verily believe was then the favorite</p>
<p>abiding-place of the mosquito, no matter where he most loves to dwell</p>
<p>now; for myriads of the pests rose up out of the tall rank grass--</p>
<p>more than I ever saw before or since--and viciously attacked both men</p>
<p>and animals.  We ourselves were somewhat protected by gloves and</p>
<p>head-nets, provided us before leaving Totten, but notwithstanding</p>
<p>these our sufferings were well-nigh intolerable; the annoyance that</p>
<p>the poor mules experienced must, therefore, have been extreme;</p>
<p>indeed, they were so terribly stung that the blood fairly trickled</p>
<p>down their sides.  Unluckily, we had to camp for one night in this</p>
<p>region; but we partly evaded the ravenous things by banking up our</p>
<p>tent walls with earth, and then, before turning in, sweeping and</p>
<p>smoking out such as had got inside.  Yet with all this there seemed</p>
<p>hundreds left to sing and sting throughout the night.  The mules</p>
<p>being without protection, we tried hard to save them from the vicious</p>
<p>insects by creating a dense smoke from a circle of smothered fires,</p>
<p>within which chain the grateful brutes gladly stood; but this relief</p>
<p>was only partial, so the moment there was light enough to enable us</p>
<p>to hook up we pulled out for Abercrombie in hot haste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Abercrombie we drove on to Saint Cloud, the terminus of the</p>
</blockquote>
<p>railroad, where, considerably the worse for our hurried trip and</p>
<p>truly wretched experience with the mosquitoes, we boarded the welcome</p>
<p>cars.  Two days later we arrived in Chicago, and having meanwhile</p>
<p>received word from General Sherman that there would be no objection</p>
<p>to my going to Europe, I began making arrangements to leave, securing</p>
<p>passage by the steamship Scotia.</p>
<p>President Grant invited me to come to see him at Long Branch before I</p>
<p>should sail, and during my brief visit there he asked which army I</p>
<p>wished to accompany, the German or the French.  I told him the</p>
<p>German, for the reason that I thought more could be seen with the</p>
<p>successful side, and that the indications pointed to the defeat of</p>
<p>the French.  My choice evidently pleased him greatly, as he had the</p>
<p>utmost contempt for Louis Napoleon, and had always denounced him as a</p>
<p>usurper and a charlatan.  Before we separated, the President gave me</p>
<p>the following letter to the representatives of our Government abroad,</p>
<p>and with it I not only had no trouble in obtaining permission to go</p>
<p>with the Germans, but was specially favored by being invited to</p>
<p>accompany the headquarters of the King of Prussia:</p>
<p>&quot;LONG BRANCH, N. J., July 25, 1870.</p>
<p>&quot;Lieutenant-General P. H. Sheridan, of the United State Army, is</p>
<p>authorized to visit Europe, to return at his own pleasure, unless</p>
<p>otherwise ordered.  He is commended to the good offices of all</p>
<p>representatives of this Government whom he may meet abroad.</p>
<p>&quot;To citizens and representatives of other Governments I introduce</p>
<p>General Sheridan as one of the most skillful, brave and deserving</p>
<p>soldiers developed by the great struggle through which the United</p>
<p>States Government has just passed.  Attention paid him will be duly</p>
<p>appreciated by the country he has served so faithfully and</p>
<p>efficiently.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT.&quot;</p>
<p>Word of my intended trip was cabled to Europe in the ordinary press</p>
<p>despatches, and our Minister to France, Mr. Elihu B. Washburn, being</p>
<p>an intimate friend of mine, and thinking that I might wish to attach</p>
<p>myself to the French army, did me the favor to take preliminary steps</p>
<p>for securing the necessary authority.  He went so far as to broach</p>
<p>the subject to the French Minister of War, but in view of the</p>
<p>informality of the request, and an unmistakable unwillingness to</p>
<p>grant it being manifested, Mr. Washburn pursued the matter no</p>
<p>further.  I did not learn of this kindly interest in my behalf till</p>
<p>after the capitulation of Paris, when Mr. Washburn told me what he</p>
<p>had done of his own motion.  Of course I thanked him gratefully, but</p>
<p>even had he succeeded in getting the permission he sought I should</p>
<p>not have accompanied the French army.</p>
<p>I sailed from New York July 27, one of my aides-de-camp, General</p>
<p>James W. Forsyth, going with me.  We reached Liverpool August 6, and</p>
<p>the next day visited the American Legation in London, where we saw</p>
<p>all the officials except our Minister, Mr. Motley, who, being absent,</p>
<p>was represented by Mr. Moran, the Secretary of the Legation.  We left</p>
<p>London August 9 for Brussels, where we were kindly cared for by the</p>
<p>American Minister, Mr. Russell Jones who the same evening saw us off</p>
<p>for Germany.  Because of the war we secured transportation only as</p>
<p>far as Vera, and here we received information that the Prussian</p>
<p>Minister of War had telegraphed to the Military Inspector of</p>
<p>Railroads to take charge of us on our arrival a Cologne, and send us</p>
<p>down to the headquarter of the Prussian army, but the Inspector, for</p>
<p>some unexplained reason, instead of doing this, sent us on to Berlin.</p>
<p>Here our Minister, Mr. George Bancroft, met us with a telegram from</p>
<p>the German Chancellor, Count Bismarck, saying we were expected to</p>
<p>come direct to the King&#x27;s headquarters and we learned also that a</p>
<p>despatch had been sent to the Prussian Minister at Brussels directing</p>
<p>him to forward us from Cologne to the army, instead of allowing us to</p>
<p>go on to Berlin, but that we had reached and quit Brussels without</p>
<p>the Minister&#x27;s knowledge.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
<p>LEAVING FOR THE SEAT OF WAR--MEETING WITH PRINCE BISMARCK--HIS</p>
<p>INTEREST IN PUBLIC OPINION IN AMERICA--HIS INCLINATIONS IN EARLY</p>
<p>LIFE--PRESENTED TO THE KING--THE BATTLE OF GRAVELOTTE--THE GERMAN</p>
<p>PLAN--ITS FINAL SUCCESS--SENDING NEWS OF THE VICTORY--MISTAKEN FOR A</p>
<p>FRENCHMAN.</p>
<p>Shortly after we arrived in Berlin the Queen sent a messenger</p>
<p>offering us an opportunity to pay our respects, and fixed an hour for</p>
<p>the visit, which was to take place the next day; but as the tenor of</p>
<p>the despatch Mr. Bancroft had received from Count Bismarck indicated</p>
<p>that some important event which it was desired I should witness was</p>
<p>about to happen at the theatre of war, our Minister got us excused</p>
<p>from our visit of ceremony, and we started for the headquarters of</p>
<p>the German army that evening--our stay in the Prussian capital having</p>
<p>been somewhat less than a day.</p>
<p>Our train was a very long one, of over eighty cars, and though drawn</p>
<p>by three locomotives, its progress to Cologne was very slow and the</p>
<p>journey most tedious.  From Cologne we continued on by rail up the</p>
<p>valley of the Rhine to Bingebruck, near Bingen, and thence across</p>
<p>through Saarbrucken to Remilly, where we left the railway and rode in</p>
<p>a hay-wagon to Pont-a-Mousson, arriving there August 17, late in the</p>
<p>afternoon.  This little city had been ceded to France at the Peace of</p>
<p>Westphalia, and although originally German, the people had become, in</p>
<p>the lapse of so many years, intensely French in sentiment.  The town</p>
<p>was so full of officers and men belonging to the German army that it</p>
<p>was difficult to get lodgings, but after some delay we found quite</p>
<p>comfortable quarters at one of the small hotels, and presently, after</p>
<p>we had succeeded in getting a slender meal, I sent my card to Count</p>
<p>von Bismarck, the Chancellor of the North German Confederation, who</p>
<p>soon responded by appointing an hour--about 9 o&#x27;clock the same</p>
<p>evening--for an interview.</p>
<p>When the Count received me he was clothed in the undress uniform of</p>
<p>the Cuirassier regiment, of which he was the colonel.  During the</p>
<p>interview which ensued, he exhibited at times deep anxiety regarding</p>
<p>the conflict now imminent, for it was the night before the battle of</p>
<p>Gravelotte, but his conversation was mostly devoted to the state of</p>
<p>public sentiment in America, about which he seemed much concerned,</p>
<p>inquiring repeatedly as to which side--France or Prussia--was charged</p>
<p>with bringing on the war.  Expressing a desire to witness the battle</p>
<p>which was expected to occur the next day, and remarking that I had</p>
<p>not had sufficient time to provide the necessary transportation, he</p>
<p>told me to be ready at 4 o&#x27;clock in the morning, and he would take me</p>
<p>out in his own carriage and present me to the King--adding that he</p>
<p>would ask one of his own staff-officers, who he knew had one or two</p>
<p>extra horses, to lend me one.  As I did not know just what my status</p>
<p>would be, and having explained to the President before leaving</p>
<p>America that I wished to accompany the German army unofficially, I</p>
<p>hardly knew whether to appear in uniform or not, so I spoke of this</p>
<p>matter too, and the Count, after some reflection, thought it best for</p>
<p>me to wear my undress uniform, minus the sword, however, because I</p>
<p>was a non combatant.</p>
<p>At 4 o&#x27;clock the next morning, the 18th, I repaired to the</p>
<p>Chancellor&#x27;s quarters.  The carriage was at the door, also the</p>
<p>saddle-horse, but as no spare mount could be procured for General</p>
<p>Forsyth, he had to seek other means to reach the battle-field.  The</p>
<p>carriage was an open one with two double seats, and in front a single</p>
<p>one for a messenger; it had also a hand-brake attached.</p>
<p>Count Bismarck and I occupied the rear seat, and Count Bismarck-</p>
<p>Bohlen--the nephew and aide-decamp to the Chancellor--and Doctor</p>
<p>Busch were seated facing us.  The conveyance was strong, serviceable,</p>
<p>and comfortable, but not specially prepossessing, and hitched to it</p>
<p>were four stout horses--logy, ungainly animals, whose clumsy harness</p>
<p>indicated that the whole equipment was meant for heavy work.  Two</p>
<p>postilions in uniform, in high military saddles on the nigh horse of</p>
<p>each span, completed the establishment.</p>
<p>All being ready, we took one of the roads from Pont-a-Mousson to</p>
<p>Rezonville, which is on the direct road from Metz to Chalons, and</p>
<p>near the central point of the field where, on the 16th of August, the</p>
<p>battle of Mars-la-Tour had been fought.  It was by this road that the</p>
<p>Pomeranians, numbering about 30,000 men, had been ordered to march to</p>
<p>Gravelotte, and after proceeding a short distance we overtook the</p>
<p>column.  As this contingent came from Count Bismarck&#x27;s own section of</p>
<p>Germany, there greeted us as we passed along, first in the dim light</p>
<p>of the morning, and later in the glow of the rising sun, continuous</p>
<p>and most enthusiastic cheering for the German Chancellor.</p>
<p>On the way Count Bismarck again recurred to the state of public</p>
<p>opinion in America with reference to the war.  He also talked much</p>
<p>about our form of government, and said that in early life his</p>
<p>tendencies were all toward republicanism, but that family influence</p>
<p>had overcome his preferences, and intimated that, after adopting a</p>
<p>political career, he found that Germany was not sufficiently advanced</p>
<p>for republicanism.  He said, further, that he had been reluctant to</p>
<p>enter upon this public career, that he had always longed to be a</p>
<p>soldier, but that here again family opposition had turned him from</p>
<p>the field of his choice into the sphere of diplomacy.</p>
<p>Not far from Mars-la-Tour we alighted, and in a little while an aide-</p>
<p>de-camp was introduced, who informed me that he was there to conduct</p>
<p>and present me to his Majesty, the King of Prussia.  As we were</p>
<p>walking along together, I inquired whether at the meeting I should</p>
<p>remove my cap, and he said no; that in an out-of-door presentation it</p>
<p>was not etiquette to uncover if in uniform.  We were soon in presence</p>
<p>of the King, where--under the shade of a clump of second-growth</p>
<p>poplar-trees, with which nearly all the farms in the north of France</p>
<p>are here and there dotted--the presentation was made in the simplest</p>
<p>and most agreeable manner.</p>
<p>His Majesty, taking my hand in both of his, gave me a thorough</p>
<p>welcome, expressing, like Count Bismarck, though through an</p>
<p>interpreter, much interest as to the sentiment in my own country</p>
<p>about the war.  At this time William the First of Prussia was</p>
<p>seventy-three years of age, and, dressed in the uniform of the</p>
<p>Guards, he seemed to be the very ideal soldier, and graced with most</p>
<p>gentle and courteous manners.  The conversation, which was brief, as</p>
<p>neither of us spoke the other&#x27;s native tongue, concluded by his</p>
<p>Majesty&#x27;s requesting me in the most cordial way to accompany his</p>
<p>headquarters during the campaign.  Thanking him for his kindness, I</p>
<p>rejoined Count Bismarck&#x27;s party, and our horses having arrived</p>
<p>meantime, we mounted and moved off to the position selected for the</p>
<p>King to witness the opening of the battle.</p>
<p>This place was on some high ground overlooking the villages of</p>
<p>Rezonville and Gravelotte, about the centre of the battlefield of</p>
<p>Mars-la-Tour, and from it most of the country to the east toward Metz</p>
<p>could also be seen.  The point chosen was an excellent one for the</p>
<p>purpose, though in one respect disagreeable, since the dead bodies of</p>
<p>many of the poor fellows killed there two days before were yet</p>
<p>unburied.  In a little while the King&#x27;s escort began to remove these</p>
<p>dead, however, bearing them away on stretchers improvised with their</p>
<p>rifles, and the spot thus cleared was much more acceptable.  Then,</p>
<p>when such unexploded shells as were lying around loose had been</p>
<p>cautiously carried away, the King, his brother, Prince Frederick</p>
<p>Charles Alexander, the chief-of-staff, General von Moltke, the</p>
<p>Minister of War, General von Roon, and Count von Bismarck assembled</p>
<p>on the highest point, and I being asked to join the group, was there</p>
<p>presented to General von Moltke.  He spoke our language fluently, and</p>
<p>Bismarck having left the party for a time to go to a neighboring</p>
<p>house to see his son, who had been wounded at Mars-la-Tour, and about</p>
<p>whom he was naturally very anxious, General von Moltke entertained me</p>
<p>by explaining the positions of the different corps, the nature and</p>
<p>object of their movements then taking place, and so on.</p>
<p>Before us, and covering Metz, lay the French army, posted on the</p>
<p>crest of a ridge extending north, and about its centre curving</p>
<p>slightly westward toward the German forces.  The left of the French</p>
<p>position was but a short distance from the Moselle, and this part of</p>
<p>the line was separated from the Germans by a ravine, the slopes,</p>
<p>fairly well wooded, rising quite sharply; farther north, near the</p>
<p>centre, this depression disappeared, merged in the general swell of</p>
<p>the ground, and thence on toward the right the ground over which an</p>
<p>approach to the French line must be made was essentially a natural</p>
<p>open glacis, that could be thoroughly swept by the fire of the</p>
<p>defenders.</p>
<p>The line extended some seven or eight miles.  To attack this</p>
<p>position, formidable everywhere, except perhaps on the right flank,</p>
<p>the Germans were bringing up the combined forces of the First and</p>
<p>Second armies, troops that within the past fortnight had already</p>
<p>successfully met the French in three pitched battles.  On the right</p>
<p>was the First Army, under command of General Von Steinmetz, the</p>
<p>victors, August 6, of Spicheren, near Saar, and, eight days later, of</p>
<p>Colombey, to the east of Metz; while the centre and left were</p>
<p>composed of the several corps of the Second Army, commanded by Prince</p>
<p>Frederick Charles of Prussia, a part of whose troops had just been</p>
<p>engaged in the sanguinary battle of Mars-la-Tour, by which Bazaine</p>
<p>was cut off from the Verdun road, and forced back toward Metz.</p>
<p>At first the German plan was simply to threaten with their right,</p>
<p>while the corps of the Second Army advanced toward the north, to</p>
<p>prevent the French, of whose intentions there was much doubt, from</p>
<p>escaping toward Chalons; then, as the purposes of the French might</p>
<p>be, developed, these corps were to change direction toward the enemy</p>
<p>successively, and seek to turn his right flank.  But the location of</p>
<p>this vital turning-point was very uncertain, and until it was</p>
<p>ascertained and carried, late in the afternoon, the action raged with</p>
<p>more or less intensity along the entire line.</p>
<p>But as it is not my purpose to describe in detail the battle of</p>
<p>Gravelotte, nor any other, I will speak of some of its incidents</p>
<p>merely.  About noon, after many preliminary skirmishes, the action</p>
<p>was begun according to the plan I have already outlined, the Germans</p>
<p>advancing their left while holding on strongly with their right, and</p>
<p>it was this wing (the First Army) that came under my observation from</p>
<p>the place where the King&#x27;s headquarters were located.  From here we</p>
<p>could see, as I have said, the village of Gravelotte.  Before it lay</p>
<p>the German troops, concealed to some extent, especially to the left,</p>
<p>by clumps of timber here and there.  Immediately in front of us,</p>
<p>however, the ground was open, and the day being clear and sunny, with</p>
<p>a fresh breeze blowing (else the smoke from a battle between four</p>
<p>hundred thousand men would have obstructed the view altogether), the</p>
<p>spectacle presented Was of unsurpassed magnificence and sublimity.</p>
<p>The German artillery opened the battle, and while the air was filled</p>
<p>with shot and shell from hundreds of guns along their entire line,</p>
<p>the German centre and left, in rather open order, moved out to the</p>
<p>attack, and as they went forward the reserves, in close column, took</p>
<p>up positions within supporting distances, yet far enough back to be</p>
<p>out of range.</p>
<p>The French artillery and mitrailleuses responded vigorously to the</p>
<p>Krupps, and with deadly effect, but as far as we could see the German</p>
<p>left continued its advance, and staff-officers came up frequently to</p>
<p>report that all was going on well at points hidden from our view</p>
<p>These reports were always made to the King first, and whenever</p>
<p>anybody arrived with tidings of the fight we clustered around to hear</p>
<p>the news, General Von Moltke unfolding a map meanwhile, and</p>
<p>explaining the situation.  This done, the chief of the staff, while</p>
<p>awaiting the next report, would either return to a seat that had been</p>
<p>made for him with some knapsacks, or would occupy the time walking</p>
<p>about, kicking clods of dirt or small stones here and there, his</p>
<p>hands clasped behind his back, his face pale and thoughtful.  He was</p>
<p>then nearly seventy years old, but because of his emaciated figure,</p>
<p>the deep wrinkles in his face, and the crow&#x27;s-feet about his eyes, he</p>
<p>looked even older, his appearance being suggestive of the practice of</p>
<p>church asceticisms rather than of his well-known ardent devotion to</p>
<p>the military profession.</p>
<p>By the middle of the afternoon the steady progress of the German left</p>
<p>and centre had driven the French from their more advanced positions</p>
<p>from behind stone walls and hedges, through valleys and hamlets, in</p>
<p>the direction of Metz, but as yet the German right had accomplished</p>
<p>little  except to get possession of the village of Gravelotte,</p>
<p>forcing the French across the deep ravine I have mentioned, which</p>
<p>runs north and south a little distance east of ihe town.</p>
<p>But it was now time for the German right to move in earnest to carry</p>
<p>the Rozerieulles ridge, on which crest the French had evidently</p>
<p>decided to make an obstinate fight to cover their withdrawal to Metz.</p>
<p>As the Germans moved to the attack here, the French fire became heavy</p>
<p>and destructive, so much so, indeed, as to cause General Von</p>
<p>Steinmetz to order some cavalry belonging to the right wing to make a</p>
<p>charge.  Crossing the ravine before described, this body of horse</p>
<p>swept up the slope beyond, the front ranks urged forward by the</p>
<p>momentum from behind.  The French were posted along a sunken road,</p>
<p>behind stone walls and houses, and as the German cavalry neared these</p>
<p>obstructions it received a dreadful fire without the least chance of</p>
<p>returning it, though still pushed on till the front ranks were</p>
<p>crowded into the deep cut of the road.  Here the slaughter was</p>
<p>terrible, for the horsemen could make no further headway; and because</p>
<p>of the blockade behind, of dead and wounded men and animals, an</p>
<p>orderly retreat was impossible, and disaster inevitable.</p>
<p>About the time the charge was ordered, the phase of the battle was</p>
<p>such that the King concluded to move his headquarters into the</p>
<p>village of Gravelotte; and just after getting there, we first learned</p>
<p>fully of the disastrous result of the charge which had been entered</p>
<p>upon with such spirit; and so much indignation was expressed against</p>
<p>Steinmetz, who, it was claimed, had made an unnecessary sacrifice of</p>
<p>his cavalry, that I thought he would be relieved on the spot; though</p>
<p>this was not done.</p>
<p>Followed by a large staff, General Steinmetz appeared in the village</p>
<p>presently, and approached the King.  When near, he bowed with great</p>
<p>respect, and I then saw that he was a very old man though his</p>
<p>soldierly figure, bronzed face, and shortcropped hair gave some</p>
<p>evidence of vigor still.  When the King spoke to him I was not close</p>
<p>enough to learn what was said; but his Majesty&#x27;s manner was</p>
<p>expressive of kindly feeling, and the fact that in a few moments the</p>
<p>veteran general returned to the command of his troops, indicated</p>
<p>that, for the present at least, his fault had been overlooked.</p>
<p>The King then moved out of the village, and just a little to the east</p>
<p>and north of it the headquarters were located on high, open ground,</p>
<p>whence we could observe the right of the German infantry advancing up</p>
<p>the eastern face of the ravine.  The advance, though slow and</p>
<p>irregular, resulted in gradually gaining ground, the French resisting</p>
<p>stoutly with a stubborn musketry fire all along the slopes.  Their</p>
<p>artillery was silent, however; and from this fact the German</p>
<p>artillery officers grew jubilant, confidently asserting that their</p>
<p>Krupp guns had dismounted the French batteries and knocked their</p>
<p>mitrailleuses to pieces.  I did not indulge in this confidence,</p>
<p>however; for, with the excellent field-glass I had, I could</p>
<p>distinctly see long columns of French troops moving to their right,</p>
<p>for the apparent purpose of making a vigorous fight on that flank;</p>
<p>and I thought it more than likely that their artillery would be heard</p>
<p>from before the Germans could gain the coveted ridge.</p>
<p>The Germans labored up the glacis slowly at the most exposed places;</p>
<p>now crawling on their bellies, now creeping on hands and knees, but,</p>
<p>in the main, moving with erect and steady bearing.  As they</p>
<p>approached within short range, they suddenly found that the French</p>
<p>artillery and mitrallleuses had by no means been silenced--about two</p>
<p>hundred pieces opening on them with fearful effect, while at the same</p>
<p>time the whole crest blazed with a deadly fire from the Chassepot</p>
<p>rifles.  Resistance like this was so unexpected by the Germans that</p>
<p>it dismayed them; and first wavering a moment, then becoming panic-</p>
<p>stricken, they broke and fled, infantry, cavalry, and artillery</p>
<p>coming down the slope without any pretence of formation, the French</p>
<p>hotly following and pouring in a heavy and constant fire as the</p>
<p>fugitives fled back across the ravine toward Gravelotte.  With this</p>
<p>the battle on the right had now assumed a most serious aspect, and</p>
<p>the indications were that the French would attack the heights of</p>
<p>Gravelotte; but the Pomeranian corps coming on the field at this</p>
<p>crisis, was led into action by Von Moltke, himself, and shortly after</p>
<p>the day was decided in favor of the Germans.</p>
<p>When the French guns opened fire, it was discovered that the King&#x27;s</p>
<p>position was within easy range, many of the shells falling near</p>
<p>enough to make the place extremely uncomfortable; so it was suggested</p>
<p>that he go to a less exposed point.  At first he refused to listen to</p>
<p>this wise counsel, but yielded finally--leaving the ground with</p>
<p>reluctance, however--and went back toward Rezonville.  I waited for</p>
<p>Count Bismarck, who did not go immediately with the King, but</p>
<p>remained at Gravelotte, looking after some of the escort who had been</p>
<p>wounded.  When he had arranged for their care, we set out to rejoin</p>
<p>the King, and before going far, overtook his Majesty, who had stopped</p>
<p>on the Chalons road, and was surrounded by a throng of fugitives,</p>
<p>whom he was berating in German so energetic as to remind me forcibly</p>
<p>of the &quot;Dutch&quot; swearing that I used to hear in my boyhood in Ohio.</p>
<p>The dressing down finished to his satisfaction, the King resumed his</p>
<p>course toward Re&#x27;zonville, halting, however, to rebuke in the same</p>
<p>emphatic style every group of runaways he overtook.</p>
<p>Passing through Rezonville, we halted just beyond the village; there</p>
<p>a fire was built, and the King, his brother, Prince Frederick</p>
<p>Charles, and Von Roon were provided with rather uncomfortable seats</p>
<p>about it, made by resting the ends of a short ladder on a couple of</p>
<p>boxes.  With much anxiety and not a little depression of spirits news</p>
<p>from the battle-field was now awaited, but the suspense did not last</p>
<p>long, for presently came the cheering intelligence that the French</p>
<p>were retiring, being forced back by the Pomeranian corps, and some of</p>
<p>the lately broken right wing organizations, that had been rallied on</p>
<p>the heights of Gravelotte.  The lost ground being thus regained, and</p>
<p>the French having been beaten on their right, it was not long before</p>
<p>word came that Bazaine&#x27;s army was falling back to Metz, leaving the</p>
<p>entire battle-field in possession of the Germans.</p>
<p>During the excitement of the day I had not much felt the want of</p>
<p>either food or water, but now that all was over I was nearly</p>
<p>exhausted, having had neither since early morning.  Indeed, all of</p>
<p>the party were in like straits; the immense armies had not only eaten</p>
<p>up nearly everything in the country, but had drunk all the wells dry,</p>
<p>too, and there seemed no relief for us till, luckily, a squad of</p>
<p>soldiers came along the road with a small cask of wine in a cart.</p>
<p>One of the staff-officers instantly appropriated the keg, and</p>
<p>proceeded to share his prize most generously.  Never had I tasted</p>
<p>anything so refreshing and delicious, but as the wine was the</p>
<p>ordinary sour stuff drunk by the peasantry of northern France, my</p>
<p>appreciation must be ascribed to my famished condition rather than to</p>
<p>any virtues of the beverage itself.</p>
<p>After I had thus quenched my thirst the King&#x27;s, brother called me</p>
<p>aside, and drawing from his coat-tail pocket a piece of stale black</p>
<p>bread, divided it with me, and while munching on this the Prince</p>
<p>began talking of his son--General Prince Frederick Charles, popularly</p>
<p>called the Red Prince--who was in command of the Second Army in this</p>
<p>battle--the German left wing.  In recounting his son&#x27;s professional</p>
<p>career the old man&#x27;s face was aglow with enthusiasm, and not without</p>
<p>good cause, for in the war between Prussia and Austria in 1866, as</p>
<p>well as in the present campaign, the Red Prince had displayed the</p>
<p>highest order of military genius.</p>
<p>The headquarters now became the scene of much bustle, despatches</p>
<p>announcing the victory being sent in all directions.  The first one</p>
<p>transmitted was to the Queen, the King directing Count Bismarck to</p>
<p>prepare it for his signature; then followed others of a more official</p>
<p>character, and while these matters were being attended to I thought I</p>
<p>would ride into the village to find, if possible, some water for my</p>
<p>horse.  Just as I entered the chief street, however, I was suddenly</p>
<p>halted by a squad of soldiers, who, taking me for a French officer</p>
<p>(my coat and forage cap resembling those of the French), leveled</p>
<p>their pieces at me.  They were greatly excited, so much so, indeed,</p>
<p>that I thought my hour had come, for they could not understand</p>
<p>English, and I could not speak German, and dare not utter</p>
<p>explanations in French.  Fortunately a few disconnected German words</p>
<p>came to me in the emergency.  With these I managed to delay my</p>
<p>execution, and one of the party ventured to come up to examine the</p>
<p>&quot;suspect&quot; more closely.  The first thing he did was to take off my</p>
<p>cap, and looking it over carefully, his eyes rested on the three</p>
<p>stars above the visor, and, pointing to them, he emphatically</p>
<p>pronounced me French.  Then of course they all became excited again,</p>
<p>more so than before, even, for they thought I was trying to practice</p>
<p>a ruse, and I question whether I should have lived to recount the</p>
<p>adventure had not an officer belonging to the King&#x27;s headquarters</p>
<p>been passing by just then, when, hearing the threatenings and</p>
<p>imprecations, he rode up to learn the cause of the hubbub, and</p>
<p>immediately recognized and released me.  When he told my wrathy</p>
<p>captors who I was, they were much mortified of course, and made the</p>
<p>most profuse apologies, promising that no such mistake should occur</p>
<p>again, and so on; but not feeling wholly reassured, for my uniform</p>
<p>was still liable to mislead, I was careful to return to headquarters</p>
<p>in company with my deliverer.  There I related what had occurred, and</p>
<p>after a good laugh all round, the King provided me with a pass which</p>
<p>he said would preclude any such mishap in the future, and would also</p>
<p>permit me to go wherever I pleased--a favor rarely bestowed.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII</p>
<p>SEARCHING FOR QUARTERS--HUNTING UP PROVISIONS--A SLENDER BREAKFAST--</p>
<p>GOING OVER THE BATTLEFIELD--THE GERMAN ARTILLERY--A GROUP OF WOUNDED-</p>
<p>-DINING WITH THE KING--ON THE MARCH--THE BAVARIANS--KIRSCHWASSER--</p>
<p>URGING ON THE TROOPS.</p>
<p>While I was absent, as related in the preceding chapter, it had been</p>
<p>decided that the King&#x27;s quarters should be established for the night</p>
<p>in the village of Rezonville; and as it would be very difficult, at</p>
<p>such a late hour, to billet the whole party regularly, Count Bismarck</p>
<p>and I went off to look for shelter for ourselves.  Remembering that I</p>
<p>had seen, when seeking to water my horse, a partly burned barn with</p>
<p>some fresh-looking hay in it, I suggested that we lodge there.  He</p>
<p>too thought it would answer our purpose, but on reaching it we found</p>
<p>the unburned part of the barn filled with wounded, and this</p>
<p>necessitating a further search we continued on through the village in</p>
<p>quest of some house not yet converted into a hospital.  Such,</p>
<p>however, seemed impossible to come upon, so at last the Count fixed</p>
<p>on one whose upper floor, we learned, was unoccupied, though the</p>
<p>lower one was covered with wounded.</p>
<p>Mounting a creaky ladder--there was no stairway--to the upper story,</p>
<p>we found a good-sized room with three large beds, one of which the</p>
<p>Chancellor assigned to the Duke of Mecklenburg and aide, and another</p>
<p>to Count Bismarck-Bohlen and me, reserving the remaining one for</p>
<p>himself.  Each bed, as is common in Germany and northern France, was</p>
<p>provided with a feather tick, but the night being warm, these spreads</p>
<p>were thrown off, and discovering that they would make a comfortable</p>
<p>shakedown on the floor, I slept there leaving Bismarck-Bohlen</p>
<p>unembarrassed by companionship--at least of a human kind.</p>
<p>At daylight I awoke, and seeing that Count Bismarck was already</p>
<p>dressed and about to go down the ladder, I felt obliged to follow his</p>
<p>example, so I too turned out, and shortly descended to the ground--</p>
<p>floor, the only delays of the toilet being those incident to</p>
<p>dressing, for there were no conveniences for morning ablutions.  Just</p>
<p>outside the door I met the Count, who, proudly exhibiting a couple of</p>
<p>eggs he had bought from the woman of the house, invited me to</p>
<p>breakfast with him, provided we could beg some coffee from the king&#x27;s</p>
<p>escort.  Putting the eggs under my charge, with many injunctions as</p>
<p>to their safe-keeping, he went off to forage for the coffee, and</p>
<p>presently returned, having been moderately successful.  One egg</p>
<p>apiece was hardly enough, however, to appease the craving of two</p>
<p>strong men ravenous from long fasting.  Indeed, it seemed only to</p>
<p>whet the appetite, and we both set out on an eager expedition for</p>
<p>more food.  Before going far I had the good luck to meet a sutler&#x27;s</p>
<p>wagon, and though its stock was about all sold, there were still left</p>
<p>four large bologna sausages, which I promptly purchased--paying a</p>
<p>round sum for them too--and hastening back found the Count already</p>
<p>returned, though without bringing anything at all to eat; but he had</p>
<p>secured a couple of bottles of brandy, and with a little of this--it</p>
<p>was excellent, too--and the sausages, the slim ration of eggs and</p>
<p>coffee was amply reinforced.</p>
<p>Breakfast over, the Chancellor invited me to accompany him in a ride</p>
<p>to the battle-field, and I gladly accepted, as I very much desired to</p>
<p>pass over the ground in front of Gravelotte, particularly so to see</p>
<p>whether the Krupp guns had really done the execution that was claimed</p>
<p>for them by the German artillery officers.  Going directly through</p>
<p>the village of Gravelotte, following the causeway over which the</p>
<p>German cavalry had passed to make its courageous but futile charge,</p>
<p>we soon reached the ground where the fighting had been the most</p>
<p>severe.  Here the field was literally covered with evidences of the</p>
<p>terrible strife, the dead and wounded strewn thick on every side.</p>
<p>In the sunken road the carnage had been awful; men and horses having</p>
<p>been slaughtered there by hundreds, helpless before the murderous</p>
<p>fire delivered from behind a high stone wall impracticable to mounted</p>
<p>troops.  The sight was sickening to an extreme, and we were not slow</p>
<p>to direct our course elsewhere, going up the glacis toward the French</p>
<p>line, the open ground over which we crossed being covered with</p>
<p>thousands of helmets, that had been thrown off by the Germans during</p>
<p>the fight and were still dotting the field, though details of</p>
<p>soldiers from the organizations which had been engaged here were</p>
<p>about to begin to gather up their abandoned headgear.</p>
<p>When we got inside the French works, I was astonished to observe how</p>
<p>little harm had been done the defenses by the German artillery, for</p>
<p>although I had not that serene faith in the effectiveness of their</p>
<p>guns held by German artillerists generally, yet I thought their</p>
<p>terrific cannonade must have left marked results.  All I could</p>
<p>perceive, however, was a disabled gun, a broken mitrailleuse, and two</p>
<p>badly damaged caissons.</p>
<p>Everything else, except a little ammunition in the trenches, had been</p>
<p>carried away, and it was plain to see, from the good shape in which</p>
<p>the French left wing had retired to Metz, that its retreat had been</p>
<p>predetermined by the disasters to the right wing.</p>
<p>By this hour the German cavalry having been thrown out to the front</p>
<p>well over toward Metz, we, following it to get a look at the city,</p>
<p>rode to a neighboring summit, supposing it would be a safe point of</p>
<p>observation; but we shortly realized the contrary, for scarcely had</p>
<p>we reached the crest when some of the French pickets, lying concealed</p>
<p>about six hundred yards off, opened fire, making it so very hot for</p>
<p>us that, hugging the necks of our horses, we incontinently fled.</p>
<p>Observing what had taken place, a troop of German cavalry charged the</p>
<p>French outpost and drove it far enough away to make safe our return,</p>
<p>and we resumed possession of the point, but only to discover that the</p>
<p>country to the east was so broken and hilly that no satisfactory view</p>
<p>of Metz could be had.</p>
<p>Returning to Gravelotte, we next visited that part of the battlefield</p>
<p>to the northeast of the village, and before long Count Bismarck</p>
<p>discovered in a remote place about twenty men dreadfully wounded.</p>
<p>These poor fellows had had no attention whatever, having been</p>
<p>overlooked by the hospital corps, and their condition was most</p>
<p>pitiful.  Yet there was one very handsome man in the group--a captain</p>
<p>of artillery--who, though shot through the right breast, was</p>
<p>talkative and cheerful, and felt sure of getting well.  Pointing,</p>
<p>however, to a comrade lying near, also shot in the breast, he</p>
<p>significantly shook his head; it was easy to see on this man&#x27;s face</p>
<p>the signs--of fast approaching death.</p>
<p>An orderly was at once despatched for a surgeon, Bismarck and I doing</p>
<p>what we could meanwhile to alleviate the intense sufferings of the</p>
<p>maimed men, bringing them water and administering a little brandy,</p>
<p>for the Count still had with him some of the morning&#x27;s supply.  When</p>
<p>the surgeons came, we transferred the wounded to their care, and</p>
<p>making our way to Rezonville, there took the Count&#x27;s carriage to</p>
<p>rejoin the King&#x27;s headquarters, which in the mean time had been moved</p>
<p>to Pont-a-Mousson.  Our route led through the village of Gorze, and</p>
<p>here we found the streets so obstructed with wagons that I feared it</p>
<p>would take us the rest of the day to get through, for the teamsters</p>
<p>would not pay the slightest heed to the cries of our postilions.  The</p>
<p>Count was equal to the emergency, however, for, taking a pistol from</p>
<p>behind his cushion, and bidding me keep my seat, he jumped out and</p>
<p>quickly began to clear the street effectively, ordering wagons to the</p>
<p>right and left.  Marching in front of the carriage and making way for</p>
<p>us till we were well through the blockade, he then resumed his seat,</p>
<p>remarking, &quot;This is not a very dignified business for the Chancellor</p>
<p>of the German Confederation, but it&#x27;s the only way to get through.&quot;</p>
<p>At Pont-a-Mousson I was rejoined by my aide, General Forsyth, and for</p>
<p>the next two days our attention was almost wholly devoted to securing</p>
<p>means of transportation.  This was most difficult to obtain, but as I</p>
<p>did not wish to impose on the kindness of the Chancellor longer, we</p>
<p>persevered till, finally, with the help of Count Bismarck-Bohlen, we</p>
<p>managed to get tolerably well equipped with a saddle-horse apiece,</p>
<p>and a two-horse carriage.  Here also, on the afternoon of August 21,</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of dining with the King.  The dinner was a simple</p>
<p>one, consisting of soup, a joint, and two or three vegetables; the</p>
<p>wines vin ordinaire and Burgundy.  There were a good many persons of</p>
<p>high rank present, none of whom spoke English, however, except</p>
<p>Bismarck, who sat next the King and acted as interpreter when his</p>
<p>Majesty conversed with me.  Little was said of the events taking</p>
<p>place around us, but the King made many inquiries concerning the war</p>
<p>of the rebellion, particularly with reference to Grant&#x27;s campaign at</p>
<p>Vicksburg; suggested, perhaps, by the fact that there, and in the</p>
<p>recent movements of the German army, had been applied many similar</p>
<p>principles of military science.</p>
<p>The French army under Marshal Bazaine having retired into the</p>
<p>fortifications of Metz, that stronghold was speedily invested by</p>
<p>Prince Frederick Charles.  Meantime the Third Army, under the Crown</p>
<p>Prince of Prussia--which, after having fought and won the battle of</p>
<p>Worth, had been observing the army of Marshal MacMahon during and</p>
<p>after the battle of Gravelotte--was moving toward Paris by way of</p>
<p>Nancy, in conjunction with an army called the Fourth, which had been</p>
<p>organized from the troops previously engaged around Metz, and on the</p>
<p>22d was directed toward Bar-le-Duc under the command of the Crown</p>
<p>Prince of Saxony.  In consequence of these operations the King</p>
<p>decided to move to Commercy, which place we reached by carriage,</p>
<p>traveling on a broad macadamized road lined on both sides with</p>
<p>poplar-trees, and our course leading through a most beautiful country</p>
<p>thickly dotted with prosperous-looking villages.</p>
<p>On reaching Commercy, Forsyth and I found that quarters had been</p>
<p>already selected for us, and our names written on the door with chalk</p>
<p>the quartermaster charged with the billeting of the officers at</p>
<p>headquarters having started out in advance to perform this duty and</p>
<p>make all needful preparations for the King before he arrived, which</p>
<p>course was usually pursued thereafter, whenever the royal</p>
<p>headquarters took up a new location.</p>
<p>Forsyth and I were lodged with the notary of the village, who over</p>
<p>and over again referred to his good fortune in not having to</p>
<p>entertain any of the Germans.  He treated us most hospitably, and</p>
<p>next morning,  on departing, we offered compensation by tendering a</p>
<p>sum--about what our bill would have been at a good hotel--to be used</p>
<p>for the &quot;benefit of the wounded or the Church.&quot;  Under this</p>
<p>stipulation the notary accepted, and we followed that plan of paying</p>
<p>for food and lodging afterward, whenever quartered in private houses.</p>
<p>The next day I set out in advance of the headquarters, and reached</p>
<p>Bar-le-Duc about noon, passing on the way the Bavarian contingent of</p>
<p>the Crown Prince&#x27;s army.  These Bavarians were trim-looking soldiers,</p>
<p>dressed in neat uniforms of light blue; they looked healthy and</p>
<p>strong, but seemed of shorter stature than the North Germans I had</p>
<p>seen in the armies of Prince Frederick Charles and General von</p>
<p>Steinmetz.  When, later in the day the King arrived, a guard for him</p>
<p>was detailed from this Bavarian contingent; a stroke of policy no</p>
<p>doubt, for the South Germans were so prejudiced against their</p>
<p>brothers of the North that no opportunity to smooth them down was</p>
<p>permitted to go unimproved.</p>
<p>Bar-le-Duc, which had then a population of about 15,000, is one of</p>
<p>the prettiest towns I saw in France, its quaint and ancient buildings</p>
<p>and beautiful boulevards charming the eye as well as exciting deep</p>
<p>interest.  The King and his immediate suite were quartered on one of</p>
<p>the best boulevards in a large building--the Bank of France--the</p>
<p>balcony of which offered a fine opportunity to observe a part of the</p>
<p>army of the Crown Prince the next day on its march toward Vitry.</p>
<p>This was the first time his Majesty had had a chance to see any of</p>
<p>these troops--as hitherto he had accompanied either the army of</p>
<p>Prince Frederick Charles, or that of General Steinmetz--and the</p>
<p>cheers with which he was greeted by the Bavarians left no room for</p>
<p>doubting their loyalty to the Confederation, notwithstanding ancient</p>
<p>jealousies.</p>
<p>While the troops were passing, Count Bismarck had the kindness to</p>
<p>point out to me the different organizations, giving scraps of their</p>
<p>history, and also speaking concerning the qualifications of the</p>
<p>different generals commanding them.  When the review was over we went</p>
<p>to the Count&#x27;s house, and there, for the first time in my life, I</p>
<p>tasted kirschwasser, a very strong liquor distilled from cherries.</p>
<p>Not knowing anything about the stuff, I had to depend on Bismarck&#x27;s</p>
<p>recommendation, and he proclaiming it fine, I took quite a generous</p>
<p>drink, which nearly strangled me and brought on a violent fit of</p>
<p>coughing.  The Chancellor said, however, that this was in no way due</p>
<p>to the liquor, but to my own inexperience, and I was bound to believe</p>
<p>the distinguished statesman, for he proved his words by swallowing a</p>
<p>goodly dose with an undisturbed and even beaming countenance,</p>
<p>demonstrating his assertion so forcibly that I forthwith set out with</p>
<p>Bismarck-Bohlen to lay in a supply for myself.</p>
<p>I spent the night in a handsome house, the property of an</p>
<p>exceptionally kind and polite gentleman bearing the indisputably</p>
<p>German name of Lager, but who was nevertheless French from head to</p>
<p>foot, if intense hatred of the Prussians be a sign of Gallic</p>
<p>nationality.  At daybreak on the 26th word came for us to be ready to</p>
<p>move by the Chalons road at 7 o&#x27;clock, but before we got off, the</p>
<p>order was suspended till 2 in the afternoon.  In the interval General</p>
<p>von Moltke arrived and held a long conference with the King, and when</p>
<p>we did pull out we traveled the remainder of the afternoon in company</p>
<p>with a part of the Crown Prince&#x27;s army, which after this conference</p>
<p>inaugurated the series of movements from Bar-le-Duc northward, that</p>
<p>finally compelled the surrender at Sedan.  This sudden change of</p>
<p>direction I did not at first understand, but soon learned that it was</p>
<p>because of the movements of Marshal MacMahon, who, having united the</p>
<p>French army beaten at Worth with three fresh corps at Chalons, was</p>
<p>marching to relieve Metz in obedience to orders from the Minister of</p>
<p>War at Paris.</p>
<p>As we passed along the column, we noticed that the Crown Prince&#x27;s</p>
<p>troops were doing their best, the officers urging the men to their</p>
<p>utmost exertions, persuading weary laggards and driving up</p>
<p>stragglers.  As a general thing, however, they marched in good shape,</p>
<p>notwithstanding the rapid gait and the trying heat, for at the outset</p>
<p>of the campaign the Prince had divested them of all impedimenta</p>
<p>except essentials, and they were therefore in excellent trim for a</p>
<p>forced march.</p>
<p>The King traveled further than usual that day--to Clermont--so we did</p>
<p>not get shelter till late, and even then not without some confusion,</p>
<p>for the quartermaster having set out toward Chalons before the change</p>
<p>of programme was ordered, was not at hand to provide for us.  I had</p>
<p>extreme good luck, though, in being quartered with a certain</p>
<p>apothecary, who, having lived for a time in the United States,</p>
<p>claimed it as a privilege even to lodge me, and certainly made me his</p>
<p>debtor for the most generous hospitality.  It was not so with some of</p>
<p>the others, however; and Count Bismarck was particularly unfortunate,</p>
<p>being billeted in a very small and uncomfortable house, where,</p>
<p>visiting him to learn more fully what was going on, I found him,</p>
<p>wrapped in a shabby old dressing-gown, hard at work.  He was</p>
<p>established in a very small room, whose only furnishings consisted of</p>
<p>a table--at which he was writing--a couple of rough chairs, and the</p>
<p>universal feather-bed, this time made on the floor in one corner of</p>
<p>the room.  On my remarking upon the limited character of his</p>
<p>quarters, the Count replied, with great good-humor, that they were</p>
<p>all right, and that he should get along well enough.  Even the tramp</p>
<p>of his clerks in the attic, and the clanking of his orderlies&#x27; sabres</p>
<p>below, did not disturb him much; he said, in fact, that he would have</p>
<p>no grievance at all were it not for a guard of Bavarian soldiers</p>
<p>stationed about the house for his safety, he presumed the sentinels</p>
<p>from which insisted on protecting and saluting the Chancellor of the</p>
<p>North German Confederation in and out of season, a proceeding that</p>
<p>led to embarrassment sometimes, as he was much troubled with a severe</p>
<p>dysentery.  Notwithstanding his trials, however, and in the midst of</p>
<p>the correspondence on which he was so intently engaged, he graciously</p>
<p>took time to explain that the sudden movement northward from Bar-le-</p>
<p>Duc was, as I have previously recounted, the result of information</p>
<p>that Marshal MacMahon was endeavoring to relieve Metz by marching</p>
<p>along the Belgian frontier; &quot;a blundering manoeuvre,&quot; remarked the</p>
<p>Chancellor, &quot;which cannot be accounted for, unless it has been</p>
<p>brought about by the political situation of the French.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
<p>AFTER MacMAHON--THE BATTLE AT BEAUMONT--THE FRENCH SURPRISED--THE</p>
<p>MARCHING OF THE GERMAN SOLDIERS--THE BATTLE OF SEDAN--GALLANT CAVALRY</p>
<p>CHARGES--DEFEAT OF THE FRENCH--THE SURRENDER OF NAPOLEON--BISMARCK</p>
<p>AND THE KING--DECORATING THE SOLDIERS.</p>
<p>All night long the forced march of the army went on through Clermont,</p>
<p>and when I turned out, just after daylight, the columns were still</p>
<p>pressing forward, the men looking tired and much bedraggled, as</p>
<p>indeed they had reason to be, for from recent rains the roads were</p>
<p>very sloppy.  Notwithstanding this, however, the troops were pushed</p>
<p>ahead with all possible vigor to intercept MacMahon and force a</p>
<p>battle before he could withdraw from his faulty movement, for which</p>
<p>it has since been ascertained he was not at all responsible.  Indeed,</p>
<p>those at the royal headquarters seemed to think of nothing else than</p>
<p>to strike MacMahon, for, feeling pretty confident that Metz could not</p>
<p>be relieved, they manifested not the slightest anxiety on that score.</p>
<p>By 8 o&#x27;clock, the skies having cleared, the headquarters set out for</p>
<p>Grand Pre&#x27;, which place we reached early in the afternoon, and that</p>
<p>evening I again had the pleasure of dining with the King.  The</p>
<p>conversation at table was almost wholly devoted to the situation, of</p>
<p>course, everybody expressing surprise at the manoeuvre of the French</p>
<p>at this time, their march along the Belgian frontier being credited</p>
<p>entirely to Napoleon.  Up to bed-time there was still much</p>
<p>uncertainty as to the exact positions of the French, but next morning</p>
<p>intelligence being received which denoted the probability of a</p>
<p>battle, we drove about ten miles, to Buzancy, and there mounting our</p>
<p>horses, rode to the front.</p>
<p>The French were posted not far from Buzancy in a strong position,</p>
<p>their right resting near Stonne and the left extending over into the</p>
<p>woods beyond Beaumont.  About 10 o&#x27;clock the Crown Prince of Saxony</p>
<p>advanced against this line, and while a part of his army turned the</p>
<p>French right, compelling it to fall back rapidly, the German centre</p>
<p>and right attacked with great vigor and much skill, surprising one of</p>
<p>the divisions of General De Failly&#x27;s corps while the men were in the</p>
<p>act of cooking their breakfast.</p>
<p>The French fled precipitately, leaving behind their tents and other</p>
<p>camp equipage, and on inspecting the ground which they had abandoned</p>
<p>so hastily, I noticed on all sides ample evidence that not even the</p>
<p>most ordinary precautions had been taken to secure the division from</p>
<p>surprise, The artillery horses had not been harnessed, and many of</p>
<p>them had been shot down at the picketrope where they had been</p>
<p>haltered the night before, while numbers of men were lying dead with</p>
<p>loaves of bread or other food instead of their muskets in their</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>Some three thousand prisoners and nearly all the artillery and</p>
<p>mitrailleuses of the division--were captured, while the fugitives</p>
<p>were pursued till they found shelter behind--Douay&#x27;s corps and the</p>
<p>rest of De Failly&#x27;s beyond Beaumont.  The same afternoon there were</p>
<p>several other severe combats along the Meuse, but I had no chance of</p>
<p>witnessing any of them, and just before night-fall I started back to</p>
<p>Buzancy, to which place the King&#x27;s headquarters had been brought</p>
<p>during the day.</p>
<p>The morning of the 31st the King moved to Vendresse.  First sending</p>
<p>our carriage back to Grand Pre&#x27; for our trunks, Forsyth and I mounted</p>
<p>our horses and rode to the battle-field accompanied by an English</p>
<p>nobleman, the Duke of Manchester.  The part of the field we traversed</p>
<p>was still thickly strewn with the dead of both armies, though all the</p>
<p>wounded had been collected in the hospitals.  In the village of</p>
<p>Beaumont, we stopped to take a look at several thousand French</p>
<p>prisoners, whose worn clothing and evident dejection told that they</p>
<p>had been doing a deal of severe marching under great discouragements.</p>
<p>The King reached the village shortly after, and we all continued on</p>
<p>to Chemery, just beyond where his Majesty alighted from his carriage</p>
<p>to observe his son&#x27;s troops file past as they came in from the</p>
<p>direction of Stonne.  This delay caused us to be as late as 9 o&#x27;clock</p>
<p>before we got shelter that night, but as it afforded me the best</p>
<p>opportunity I had yet had for seeing the German soldiers on the</p>
<p>march, I did not begrudge the time.  They moved in a somewhat open</p>
<p>and irregular column of fours, the intervals between files being</p>
<p>especially intended to give room for a peculiar swinging gait, with</p>
<p>which the men seemed to urge themselves over the ground with ease and</p>
<p>rapidity.  There was little or no straggling, and being strong, lusty</p>
<p>young fellows, and lightly equipped--they carried only needle-guns,</p>
<p>ammunition, a very small knapsack, a water-bottle, and a haversack-</p>
<p>they strode by with an elastic step, covering at least three miles an</p>
<p>hour.</p>
<p>It having been definitely ascertained that the demoralized French</p>
<p>were retiring to Sedan, on the evening of August 31 the German army</p>
<p>began the work of hemming them in there, so disposing the different</p>
<p>corps as to cover the ground from Donchery around by Raucourt to</p>
<p>Carignan.  The next morning this line was to be drawn in closer on</p>
<p>Sedan; and the Crown Prince of Saxony was therefore ordered to take</p>
<p>up a position to the north of Bazeilles, beyond the right bank of the</p>
<p>Meuse, while the Crown Prince of Prussia was to cross his right wing</p>
<p>over the Meuse at Remilly, to move on Bazeilles, his centre meantime</p>
<p>marching against a number of little hamlets still held by the French</p>
<p>between there and Donchery.  At this last-mentioned place strong</p>
<p>reserves were to be held, and from it the Eleventh Corps, followed by</p>
<p>the Fifth and a division of cavalry, was to march on St. Menges.</p>
<p>Forsyth and I started early next morning, September 1, and in a thick</p>
<p>fog-which, however, subsequently gave place to bright sunshine--we</p>
<p>drove to the village of Chevenges, where, mounting our horses, we</p>
<p>rode in a northeasterly direction to the heights of Frenois and</p>
<p>Wadelincourt, bordering the river Meuse on the left bank, where from</p>
<p>the crest we had a good view of the town of Sedan with its circling</p>
<p>fortifications, which, though extensive, were not so formidable as</p>
<p>those around Metz.  The King and his staff were already established</p>
<p>on these heights, and at a point so well chosen that his Majesty</p>
<p>could observe the movements of both armies immediately east and south</p>
<p>of Sedan, and also to the northwest toward Floing and the Belgian</p>
<p>frontier.</p>
<p>The battle was begun to the east and northeast of Sedan as early as</p>
<p>half-past 4 o&#x27;clock by the German right wing--the fighting being</p>
<p>desultory--and near the same hour the Bavarians attacked Bazeilles.</p>
<p>This village, some two miles southeast of Sedan, being of importance,</p>
<p>was defended with great obstinacy, the French contesting from street</p>
<p>to street and house to house the attack of the Bavarians till near</p>
<p>10 o&#x27;clock, when, almost every building being knocked to pieces, they</p>
<p>were compelled to relinquish the place.  The possession of this</p>
<p>village gave the Germans to the east of Sedan a continuous line,</p>
<p>extending from the Meuse northward through La Moncelle and Daigny to</p>
<p>Givonne, and almost to the Belgian frontier.</p>
<p>While the German centre and right were thus engaged, the left had</p>
<p>moved in accordance with the prescribed plan.  Indeed, some of these</p>
<p>troops had crossed the Meuse the night before, and now, at a little</p>
<p>after 6 o&#x27;clock, their advance could be seen just north of the</p>
<p>village of Floing.  Thus far these columns, under the immediate eye</p>
<p>of the Crown Prince of Prussia, had met with no opposition to their</p>
<p>march, and as soon as they got to the high ground above the village</p>
<p>they began extending to the east, to connect with the Army of the</p>
<p>Meuse.  This juncture was effected at Illy without difficulty, and</p>
<p>the French army was now completely encompassed.</p>
<p>After a severe fight, the Crown Prince drove the French through</p>
<p>Floing, and as the ground between this village and Sedan is an</p>
<p>undulating open plain, everywhere visible, there was then offered a</p>
<p>rare opportunity for seeing the final conflict preceding the</p>
<p>surrender.  Presently up out of the little valley where Floing is</p>
<p>located came the Germans, deploying just on the rim of the plateau a</p>
<p>very heavy skirmish-line, supported by a line of battle at close</p>
<p>distance.  When these skirmishers appeared, the French infantry had</p>
<p>withdrawn within its intrenched lines, but a strong body of their</p>
<p>cavalry, already formed in a depression to the right of the Floing</p>
<p>road, now rode at the Germans in gallant style, going clear through</p>
<p>the dispersed skirmishers to the main line of battle.  Here the</p>
<p>slaughter of the French was awful, for in addition to the deadly</p>
<p>volleys from the solid battalions of their enemies, the skirmishers,</p>
<p>who had rallied in knots at advantageous places, were now delivering</p>
<p>a severe and effective fire.  The gallant horsemen, therefore, had to</p>
<p>retire precipitately, but re-forming in the depression, they again</p>
<p>undertook the hopeless task of breaking the German infantry, making</p>
<p>in all four successive charges.  Their ardor and pluck were of no</p>
<p>avail, however, for the Germans, growing stronger every minute by the</p>
<p>accession of troops from Floing, met the fourth attack in such large</p>
<p>force that, even before coming in contact with their adversaries, the</p>
<p>French broke and retreated to the protection of the intrenchments,</p>
<p>where, from the beginning of the combat, had been lying plenty of</p>
<p>idle infantry, some of which at least, it seemed plain to me, ought</p>
<p>to have been thrown into the fight.  This action was the last one of</p>
<p>consequence around Sedan, for, though with the contraction of the</p>
<p>German lines their batteries kept cannonading more or less, and the</p>
<p>rattle of musketry continued to be heard here and there, yet the hard</p>
<p>fighting of the day practically ended on the plateau of Floing.</p>
<p>By 3 o&#x27;clock, the French being in a desperate and hopeless situation,</p>
<p>the King ordered the firing to be stopped, and at once despatched one</p>
<p>of his staff--Colonel von Bronsart--with a demand for a surrender.</p>
<p>Just as this officer was starting off, I remarked to Bismarck that</p>
<p>Napoleon himself would likely be one of the prizes, but the Count,</p>
<p>incredulous, replied, &quot;Oh no; the old fox is too cunning to be caught</p>
<p>in such a trap; he has doubtless slipped off to Paris&quot;--a belief</p>
<p>which I found to prevail pretty generally about headquarters.</p>
<p>In the lull that succeeded, the King invited many of those about him</p>
<p>to luncheon, a caterer having provided from some source or other a</p>
<p>substantial meal of good bread, chops and peas, with a bountiful</p>
<p>supply of red and sherry wines.  Among those present were Prince</p>
<p>Carl, Bismarck, Von Moltke, Von Roon, the Duke of Weimar, the Duke of</p>
<p>Coburg, the Grand-Duke of Mecklenburg, Count Hatzfeldt, Colonel</p>
<p>Walker, of the English army, General Forsyth, and I.  The King was</p>
<p>agreeable and gracious at all times, but on this occasion he was</p>
<p>particularly so, being naturally in a happy frame of mind because</p>
<p>this day the war had reached a crisis which presaged for the near</p>
<p>future the complete vanquishment of the French.</p>
<p>Between 4 and 5 o&#x27;clock Colonel von Bronsart returned from his</p>
<p>mission to Sedan, bringing word to the King that the commanding</p>
<p>officer there General Wimpffen, wished to know, in order that the</p>
<p>further effusion of blood might be spared, upon what terms he might</p>
<p>surrender.  The Colonel brought the intelligence also that the French</p>
<p>Emperor was in the town.  Soon after Von Bronsart&#x27;s arrival a French</p>
<p>officer approached from Sedan, preceded by a white flag and two</p>
<p>German officers.  Coming up the road till within a few hundred yards</p>
<p>of us, they halted; then one of the Germans rode forward to say that</p>
<p>the French officer was Napoleon&#x27;s adjutant, bearing an autograph</p>
<p>letter from the Emperor to the King of Prussia.  At this the King,</p>
<p>followed by Bismarck, Von Moltke, and Von Roon, walked out to the</p>
<p>front a little distance and halted, his Majesty still in advance, the</p>
<p>rest of us meanwhile forming in a line some twenty paces to the rear</p>
<p>of the group.  The envoy then approached, at first on horseback, but</p>
<p>when within about a hundred yards he dismounted, and uncovering, came</p>
<p>the remaining distance on foot, bearing high up in his right hand the</p>
<p>despatch from Napoleon.  The bearer proved to be General Reille, and</p>
<p>as he handed the Emperor&#x27;s letter to the King, his Majesty saluted</p>
<p>him with the utmost formality and precision.  Napoleon&#x27;s letter was</p>
<p>the since famous one, running so characteristically, thus: &quot;Not</p>
<p>having been able to die in the midst of my troops, there is nothing</p>
<p>left me but to place my sword in your Majesty&#x27;s hands.&quot; The reading</p>
<p>finished, the King returned to his former post, and after a</p>
<p>conference with Bismarck, Von Moltke, and Von Roon, dictated an</p>
<p>answer accepting Napoleon&#x27;s surrender, and requesting him to</p>
<p>designate an officer with power to treat for the capitulation of the</p>
<p>army, himself naming Von Moltke to represent the Germans.  The King</p>
<p>then started for Vendresse, to pass the night.  It was after</p>
<p>7 o&#x27;clock now, and hence too late to arrange anything more where we</p>
<p>were, so further negotiations were deferred till later in the</p>
<p>evening; and I, wishing to be conveniently near Bismarck, resolved to</p>
<p>take up quarters in Donchery.  On our way thither we were met by the</p>
<p>Count&#x27;s nephew, who assuring us that it would be impossible to find</p>
<p>shelter there in the village, as all the houses were filled with</p>
<p>wounded, Forsyth and I decided to continue on to Chevenge.  On the</p>
<p>other hand, Bismarck-Bohlen bore with him one great comfort--some</p>
<p>excellent brandy.  Offering the flask to his uncle, he said: &quot;You&#x27;ve</p>
<p>had a hard day of it; won&#x27;t you refresh yourself?&quot;  The Chancellor,</p>
<p>without wasting time to answer, raised the bottle to his lips,</p>
<p>exclaiming: &quot;Here&#x27;s to the unification of Germany!&quot; which sentiment</p>
<p>the gurgling of an astonishingly long drink seemed to emphasize.  The</p>
<p>Count then handed the bottle back to his nephew, who, shaking it,</p>
<p>ejaculated, &quot;Why, we can&#x27;t pledge you in return--there is nothing</p>
<p>left!&quot; to which came the waggish response, I beg pardon; it was so</p>
<p>dark I couldn&#x27;t see&quot;; nevertheless there was a little remaining, as I</p>
<p>myself can aver.</p>
<p>Having left our carriage at Chevenge, Forsyth and I stopped there to</p>
<p>get it, but a long search proving fruitless, we took lodging in the</p>
<p>village at the house of the cure, resolved to continue the hunt in</p>
<p>the morning.  But then we had no better success, so concluding that</p>
<p>our vehicle had been pressed into the hospital service, we at an</p>
<p>early hour on the 2d of September resumed the search, continuing on</p>
<p>down the road in the direction of Sedan.  Near the gate of the city</p>
<p>we came on the German picket-line, and one of the Officers,</p>
<p>recognizing our uniforms--he having served in the war of the</p>
<p>rebellion--stepped forward and addressed me in good English.  We</p>
<p>naturally fell into conversation, and in the midst of it there came</p>
<p>out through the gate an open carriage, or landau, containing two men,</p>
<p>one of whom, in the uniform of a general and smoking a cigarette, we</p>
<p>recognized, when the conveyance drew near, as the Emperor Louis</p>
<p>Napoleon.  The landau went on toward Donchery at a leisurely pace,</p>
<p>and we, inferring that there was something more important at hand</p>
<p>just then than the recovery of our trap, followed at a respectful</p>
<p>distance.  Not quite a mile from Donchery is a cluster of three or</p>
<p>four cottages, and at the first of these the landau stopped to await,</p>
<p>as we afterward ascertained, Count Bismarck, with whom the diplomatic</p>
<p>negotiations were to be settled.  Some minutes elapsed before he</p>
<p>came, Napoleon remaining seated in his carriage meantime, still</p>
<p>smoking, and accepting with nonchalance the staring of a group of</p>
<p>German soldiers near by, who were gazing on their fallen foe with</p>
<p>curious and eager interest.</p>
<p>Presently a clattering of hoofs was heard, and looking toward the</p>
<p>sound, I perceived the Chancellor cantering down the road.  When</p>
<p>abreast of the carriage he dismounted, and walking up to it, saluted</p>
<p>the Emperor in a quick, brusque way that seemed to startle him.</p>
<p>After a word or two, the party moved perhaps a hundred yards further</p>
<p>on, where they stopped opposite the weaver&#x27;s cottage so famous from</p>
<p>that day.  This little house is on the east side of the Donchery</p>
<p>road, near its junction with that to Frenois, and stands about twenty</p>
<p>paces back from the highway.  In front is a stone wall covered with</p>
<p>creeping vines, and from a gate in this wall runs to the front door a</p>
<p>path, at this time bordered on both sides with potato vines.</p>
<p>The Emperor having alighted at the gate, he and Bismarck walked</p>
<p>together along the narrow path and entered the cottage.  Reappearing</p>
<p>in about a quarter of an hour, they came out and seated themselves in</p>
<p>the open air, the weaver having brought a couple of chairs.  Here</p>
<p>they engaged in an animated conversation, if much gesticulation is</p>
<p>any indication.  The talk lasted fully an hour, Bismarck seeming to</p>
<p>do most of it, but at last he arose, saluted the Emperor, and strode</p>
<p>down the path toward his horse.  Seeing me standing near the gate, he</p>
<p>joined me for a moment, and asked if I had noticed how the Emperor</p>
<p>started when they first met, and I telling him that I had, he added,</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it must have been due to my manners, not my words, for these</p>
<p>we&#x27;re, &quot;I salute your Majesty just as I would my King.&quot;  Then the</p>
<p>Chancellor continued to chat a few minutes longer, assuring me that</p>
<p>nothing further was to be done there, and that we had better go to</p>
<p>the Chateau Bellevue, where, he said, the formal surrender was to</p>
<p>take place.  With this he rode off toward Vendresse to communicate</p>
<p>with his sovereign, and Forsyth and I made ready to go to the Chateau</p>
<p>Bellevue.</p>
<p>Before we set out, however, a number of officers of the King&#x27;s suite</p>
<p>arrived at the weaver&#x27;s cottage, and from them I gathered that there</p>
<p>were differences at the royal headquarters as to whether peace should</p>
<p>be made then at Sedan, or the war continued till the French capital</p>
<p>was taken.  I further heard that the military advisers of the King</p>
<p>strongly advocated an immediate move on Paris, while the Chancellor</p>
<p>thought it best to make peace now, holding Alsace and Lorraine, and</p>
<p>compelling the payment of an enormous levy of money; and these rumors</p>
<p>were most likely correct, for I had often heard Bismarck say that</p>
<p>France being the richest country in Europe, nothing could keep her</p>
<p>quiet but effectually to empty her pockets; and besides this, he</p>
<p>impressed me as holding that it would be better policy to preserve</p>
<p>the Empire.</p>
<p>On our way to the chateau we fell in with a number of artillery</p>
<p>officers bringing up their guns hurriedly to post them closer in to</p>
<p>the beleaguered town on a specially advantageous ridge.  Inquiring</p>
<p>the cause of this move, we learned that General Wimpffen had not yet</p>
<p>agreed to the terms of surrender; that it was thought he would not,</p>
<p>and that they wanted to be prepared for any such contingency.  And</p>
<p>they were preparing with a vengeance too, for I counted seventy-two</p>
<p>Krupp guns in one continuous line trained on the Chateau Bellevue and</p>
<p>Sedan.</p>
<p>Napoleon went directly from the weaver&#x27;s to the Chateau Bellevue, and</p>
<p>about 10 o&#x27;clock the King of Prussia arrived from Frenois,</p>
<p>accompanied by a few of his own suite and the Crown Prince with</p>
<p>several members of his staff; and Von Moltke and Wimpffen having</p>
<p>settled their points of difference before the two monarchs met,</p>
<p>within the next half-hour the articles of capitulation were formally</p>
<p>signed.</p>
<p>On the completion of the surrender--the occasion being justly</p>
<p>considered a great one--the Crown Prince proceeded to distribute</p>
<p>among the officers congregated in the chateau grounds &#x27;the order of</p>
<p>the Iron Cross&#x27;--a generous supply of these decorations being carried</p>
<p>in a basket by one of his orderlies, following him about as he walked</p>
<p>along.  Meantime the King, leaving Napoleon in the chateau to</p>
<p>ruminate on the fickleness of fortune, drove off to see his own</p>
<p>victorious soldiers, who greeted him with huzzas that rent the air,</p>
<p>and must have added to the pangs of the captive Emperor.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>
<p>RIDING OVER THE BATTLEFIELD--DESTRUCTION OF BAZEILLES--MISTAKES OF</p>
<p>THE FRENCH--MARSHAL BAZAINE ON TO PARIS--A WEEK IN MEAUX--RHEIMS--ON</p>
<p>THE PICKETLINE-UNDER FIRE--A SURRENDER--AT VERSAILLES--GENERAL</p>
<p>BURNSIDE AND Mr. FORBES IN PARIS.</p>
<p>The Crown Prince having got to the bottom of his medal basket-that is</p>
<p>to say, having finished his liberal distribution of decorations to</p>
<p>his officers--Forsyth and I rode off by way of Wadelincourt to</p>
<p>Bazeilles to see what had taken place on that part of the field, and</p>
<p>the sight that met our eyes as we entered the village was truly</p>
<p>dreadful to look upon.  Most of the houses had been knocked down or</p>
<p>burned the day before, but such as had been left standing were now in</p>
<p>flames, the torch having been applied because, as it was claimed,</p>
<p>Frenchmen concealed in them had fired on the wounded.  The streets</p>
<p>were still encumbered with both German and French dead, and it was</p>
<p>evident that of those killed in the houses the bodies had not been</p>
<p>removed, for the air was loaded with odors of burning flesh.  From</p>
<p>Bazeille we rode on toward the north about two miles, along where the</p>
<p>fight had been largely an artillery duel, to learn what we could of</p>
<p>the effectiveness of the Krupp gun.  Counting all the French dead we</p>
<p>came across killed by artillery, they figured up about three hundred-</p>
<p>-a ridiculously small number; in fact, not much more than one dead</p>
<p>man for each Krupp gun on that part of the line.  Although the number</p>
<p>of dead was in utter disproportion to the terrific six-hour</p>
<p>cannonade, yet small as it was the torn and mangled bodies made such</p>
<p>a horrible sight that we turned back toward Bazeilles without having</p>
<p>gone further than Givonne.</p>
<p>At Bazeilles we met the King, accompanied by Bismarck and several of</p>
<p>the staff.  They too had been riding over the field, the King making</p>
<p>this a practice, to see that the wounded were not neglected.  As I</p>
<p>drew up by the party, Bismarck accosted me with, &quot;Well, General,</p>
<p>aren&#x27;t you hungry?  This is just the place to whet one&#x27;s appetite--</p>
<p>these burning Frenchmen--Ugh!&quot; and shrugging his shoulders in evident</p>
<p>disgust, he turned away to join his Majesty in further explorations,</p>
<p>Forsyth and I continuing on to Chevenges.  Here we got the first</p>
<p>inkling of what had become of our carriage since leaving it two days</p>
<p>before: it had been pressed into service to carry wounded officers</p>
<p>from the field during the battle, but afterward released, and was now</p>
<p>safe at the house in Vendresse where we had been quartered the night</p>
<p>of the 31st, so, on hearing this, we settled to go there again to</p>
<p>lodge, but our good friend, the cure&#x27;, insisting that we should stay</p>
<p>with him, we remained in Chevenges till next morning.</p>
<p>On September 3 the King removed from Vendresse to Rethel, where he</p>
<p>remained two days; in the mean while the Germans, 240,000 strong,</p>
<p>beginning their direct march to Paris.  The French had little with</p>
<p>which to oppose this enormous force, not more, perhaps, than 50,000</p>
<p>regular troops; the rest of their splendid army had been lost or</p>
<p>captured in battle, or was cooped up in the fortifications of Metz,</p>
<p>Strasburg, and other places, in consequence of blunders without</p>
<p>parallel in history, for which Napoleon and the Regency in Paris must</p>
<p>be held accountable.  The first of these gross faults was the fight</p>
<p>at Worth, where MacMahon, before his army was mobilized, accepted</p>
<p>battle with the Crown Prince, pitting 50,000 men against 175,000; the</p>
<p>next was Bazaine&#x27;s fixing upon Metz as his base, and stupidly putting</p>
<p>himself in position to be driven back to it, when there was no</p>
<p>possible obstacle to his joining forces with MacMahon at Chalons;</p>
<p>while the third and greatest blunder of all was MacMahon&#x27;s move to</p>
<p>relieve Metz, trying to slip 140,000 men along the Belgian frontier.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is exasperating and sickening to think of all this; to</p>
<p>think that Bazaine carried into Metz--a place that should have been</p>
<p>held, if at all, with not over 25,000 men--an army of 180,000,</p>
<p>because it contained, the excuse was, &quot;an accumulation of stores.&quot;</p>
<p>With all the resources of rich France to draw upon, I cannot conceive</p>
<p>that this excuse was sincere; on the contrary, I think that the</p>
<p>movement of Bazaine must have been inspired by Napoleon with a view</p>
<p>to the maintenance of his dynasty rather than for the good of France.</p>
<p>As previously stated, Bismarck did not approve of the German army&#x27;s</p>
<p>moving on Paris after the battle of Sedan.  Indeed, I think he</p>
<p>foresaw and dreaded the establishment of a Republic, his idea being</p>
<p>that if peace was made then, the Empire could be continued in the</p>
<p>person of the Prince Imperial who--, coming to the throne under</p>
<p>German influences, would be pliable in his hands.  These views found</p>
<p>frequent expression in private, and in public too; I myself</p>
<p>particularly remember the Chancellor&#x27;s speaking thus most unguardedly</p>
<p>at a dinner in Rheims.  But he could not prevent the march to Paris;</p>
<p>it was impossible to stop the Germans, flushed with success.  &quot;On to</p>
<p>Paris&quot; was written by the soldiers on every door, and every fence-</p>
<p>board along the route to the capital, and the thought of a triumphant</p>
<p>march down the Champs Elysees was uppermost with every German, from</p>
<p>the highest to the lowest grade.</p>
<p>The 5th of September we set out for Rheims.  There it was said the</p>
<p>Germans would meet with strong resistance, for the French intended to</p>
<p>die to the last man before giving up that city.  But this proved all</p>
<p>fudge, as is usual with these &quot;last ditch&quot; promises, the garrison</p>
<p>decamping immediately at the approach of a few Uhlans.  So far as I</p>
<p>could learn, but a single casualty happened; this occurred to an</p>
<p>Uhlan, wounded by a shot which it was reported was fired from a house</p>
<p>after the town was taken; so, to punish this breach of faith, a levy</p>
<p>of several hundred bottles of champagne was made, and the wine</p>
<p>divided about headquarters, being the only seizure made in the city,</p>
<p>I believe, for though Rheims, the centre of the champagne district,</p>
<p>had its cellars well stocked, yet most of them being owned by German</p>
<p>firms, they received every protection.</p>
<p>The land about Rheims is of a white, chalky character, and very poor,</p>
<p>but having been terraced and enriched with fertilizers, it produces</p>
<p>the champagne grape in such abundance that the region, once</p>
<p>considered valueless, and named by the peasantry the &quot;land of the</p>
<p>louse,&quot; now supports a dense population.  We remained in Rheims eight</p>
<p>days, and through the politeness of the American Consul--Mr. Adolph</p>
<p>Gill--had the pleasure of seeing all the famous wine cellars, and</p>
<p>inspecting the processes followed in champagne making, from the step</p>
<p>of pressing the juice from the grape to that which shows the wine</p>
<p>ready for the market.  Mr. Gill also took us to see everything else</p>
<p>of special interest about the city, and there being much to look at--</p>
<p>fine old churches, ancient fortifications, a Roman gateway, etc.--the</p>
<p>days slipped by very quickly, though the incessant rains somewhat</p>
<p>interfered with our enjoyment.</p>
<p>For three or four days all sorts of rumors were rife as to what was</p>
<p>doing in Paris, but nothing definite was learned till about the 9th;</p>
<p>then Count Bismarck informed me that the Regency had been overthrown</p>
<p>on the 4th, and that the Empress Eugenie had escaped to Belgium.  The</p>
<p>King of Prussia offered her an asylum with the Emperor at</p>
<p>Wilhelmshohe, &quot;where she ought to go,&quot; said the Chancellor, &quot;for her</p>
<p>proper place is with her husband,&quot; but he feared she would not.  On</p>
<p>the same occasion he also told me that Jules Favre--the head of the</p>
<p>Provisional Government--had sent him the suggestion that, the Empire</p>
<p>being gone, peace should be made and the Germans withdrawn, but that</p>
<p>he (Bismarck) was now compelled to recognize the impossibility of</p>
<p>doing this till Paris was taken, for although immediately after the</p>
<p>surrender of Sedan he desired peace, the past few days had made it</p>
<p>plain that the troops would not be satisfied with anything short of</p>
<p>Paris, no matter what form of Government the French should ultimately</p>
<p>adopt.</p>
<p>The German army having met with no resistance whatever in its march</p>
<p>on Paris, its advance approached the capital rapidly, and by the 14th</p>
<p>of September the royal headquarters moved by a fine macadamized road</p>
<p>to the Chateau Thierry, and on the 5th reached Meaux, about twenty-</p>
<p>eight miles from Paris, where we remained four days awaiting the</p>
<p>reconstruction of some railroad and canal bridges.  The town of Meaux</p>
<p>has a busy population of about 10,000 souls, in peaceable times</p>
<p>principally occupied in manufacturing flour for the Paris market,</p>
<p>having a fine waterpower for the many mills.  These were kept going</p>
<p>day and night to supply the German army; and it was strange to see</p>
<p>with what zeal Frenchmen toiled to fill the stomachs of their</p>
<p>inveterate enemies, and with what alacrity the mayor and other.</p>
<p>officials filled requisitions for wine, cheese, suits of livery,</p>
<p>riding-whips, and even squab pigeons.</p>
<p>During our stay at Meaux the British Minister Lord Lyons, endeavored</p>
<p>to bring about a cessation of hostilities, to this end sending his</p>
<p>secretary out from Paris with a letter to Count Bismarck, offering to</p>
<p>serve as mediator.  The Chancellor would not agree to this, however,</p>
<p>for he conjectured that the action of the British Minister had been</p>
<p>inspired by Jules Favre, who, he thought, was trying to draw the</p>
<p>Germans into negotiations through the medium of a third party only</p>
<p>for purposes of delay.  So the next morning Lord Lyons&#x27;s secretary,</p>
<p>Mr. Edward Malet, returned to Paris empty-handed, except that he bore</p>
<p>a communication positively declining mediation; which message,</p>
<p>however, led no doubt to an interview between Bismarck and Favre a</p>
<p>couple of days later.</p>
<p>The forenoon of September 19 the King removed to the Chateau</p>
<p>Ferrieres--a castle belonging to the Rothschild family, where</p>
<p>Napoleon had spent many happy days in the time of his prosperity.</p>
<p>His Majesty took up his quarters here at the suggestion of the owner,</p>
<p>we were told, so that by the presence of the King the magnificent</p>
<p>chateau and its treasures of art would be unquestionably protected</p>
<p>from all acts of vandalism.</p>
<p>All of the people at headquarters except the King&#x27;s immediate suite</p>
<p>were assigned quarters at Lagny; and while Forsyth and I, accompanied</p>
<p>by Sir Henry Havelock, of the British army, were driving thither, we</p>
<p>passed on the road the representative of the National Defense</p>
<p>Government, Jules Favre, in a carriage heading toward Meaux.</p>
<p>Preceded by a flag of truce and accompanied by a single, companion,</p>
<p>be was searching for Count Bismarck, in conformity, doubtless, with</p>
<p>the message the Chancellor had sent to Paris on the 17th by the</p>
<p>British secretary.  A half-mile further on we met Bismarck.  He too</p>
<p>was traveling toward Meaux, not in the best of humor either, it</p>
<p>appeared, for having missed finding the French envoy at the</p>
<p>rendezvous where they had agreed to meet, he stopped long enough to</p>
<p>say that the &quot;air was full of lies, and that there were many persons</p>
<p>with the army bent on business that did not concern them.&quot;</p>
<p>The armies of the two Crown Princes were now at the outskirts of</p>
<p>Paris.  They had come from Sedan mainly by two routes--the Crown</p>
<p>Prince of Saxony marching by the northern line, through Laon and</p>
<p>Soissons, and the Crown Prince of Prussia by the southern line,</p>
<p>keeping his right wing on the north bank of the Marne, while his left</p>
<p>and centre approached the French capital by roads between that river</p>
<p>and the Seine.</p>
<p>The march of these armies had been unobstructed by any resistance</p>
<p>worth mentioning, and as the routes of both columns lay through a</p>
<p>region teeming with everything necessary for their support, and rich</p>
<p>even in luxuries, it struck me that such campaigning was more a vast</p>
<p>picnic than like actual war.  The country supplied at all points</p>
<p>bread, meat, and wine in abundance, and the neat villages, never more</p>
<p>than a mile or two apart, always furnished shelter; hence the</p>
<p>enormous trains required to feed and provide camp equipage for an</p>
<p>army operating in a sparsely settled country were dispensed with; in</p>
<p>truth, about the only impedimenta of the Germans was their wagons</p>
<p>carrying ammunition, pontoon-boats, and the field-telegraph.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th I started out accompanied by Forsyth and</p>
<p>Sir Henry Havelock, and took the road through Boissy St. George,</p>
<p>Boissy St. Martins and Noisy Le Grand to Brie.  Almost every foot of</p>
<p>the way was strewn with fragments of glass from wine bottles, emptied</p>
<p>and then broken by the troops.  There was, indeed, so much of this</p>
<p>that I refrain from making any estimate of the number of bottles,</p>
<p>lest I be thought to exaggerate, but the road was literally paved</p>
<p>with glass, and the amount of wine consumed (none was wasted) must</p>
<p>have been enormous, far more, even, than I had seen evidence of at</p>
<p>any time before.  There were two almost continuous lines of broken</p>
<p>bottles along the roadsides all the way down from Sedan; but that</p>
<p>exhibit was small compared with what we saw about Brie.</p>
<p>At Brie we were taken charge of by the German commandant of the</p>
<p>place.  He entertained us most hospitably for an hour or so, and</p>
<p>then, accompanied by a lieutenant, who was to be our guide, I set out</p>
<p>ahead of my companions to gain a point on the picket-line where I</p>
<p>expected to get a good look at the French, for their rifle-pits were</p>
<p>but a few hundred yards off across the Marne, their main line being</p>
<p>just behind the rifle-pits.  As the lieutenant and I rode through the</p>
<p>village, some soldiers warned us that the adventure would ,be</p>
<p>dangerous, but that we could probably get to the desired place unhurt</p>
<p>if we avoided the French fire by forcing our horses to a run in</p>
<p>crossing some open streets where we would be exposed.  On getting to</p>
<p>the first street my guide galloped ahead to show the way, and as the</p>
<p>French were not on the lookout for anything of the kind at these</p>
<p>dangerous points, only a few stray shots were drawn by the</p>
<p>lieutenant, but when I followed, they were fully up to what was going</p>
<p>on, and let fly a volley every time they saw me in the open.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, in their excitement they overshot, but when I</p>
<p>drew rein alongside of my guide under protection of the bluff where</p>
<p>the German picket was posted, my hair was all on end, and I was about</p>
<p>as badly scared as ever I had been in my life.  As soon as I could</p>
<p>recover myself I thought of Havelock and Forsyth, with the hope that</p>
<p>they would not follow; nor did they, for having witnessed my</p>
<p>experience, they wisely concluded that, after all, they did not care</p>
<p>so much to see the French rifle-pits.</p>
<p>When I had climbed to the top of the bluff I was much disappointed,</p>
<p>for I could see but little--only the advanced rifle-pits across the</p>
<p>river, and Fort Nogent beyond them, not enough, certainly, to repay a</p>
<p>non-combatant for taking the risk of being killed.  The next question</p>
<p>was to return, and deciding to take no more such chances as those we</p>
<p>had run in coming out, I said we would wait till dark, but this</p>
<p>proved unnecessary, for to my utter astonishment my guide informed me</p>
<p>that there was a perfectly safe route by which we might go back.  I</p>
<p>asked why we had not taken it in coming, and he replied that he had</p>
<p>thought it &quot;too long and circuitous.&quot;  To this I could say nothing,</p>
<p>but I concluded that that was not quite the correct reason; the truth</p>
<p>is that early that morning the young fellow had been helping to empty</p>
<p>some of the many wine bottles I saw around Brie, and consequently had</p>
<p>a little more &quot;Dutch courage&quot;--was a little more rash--than would</p>
<p>have been the case under other conditions.</p>
<p>I rode back to Brie by the &quot;long and circuitous&quot; route, and inquiring</p>
<p>there for my companions, found Havelock waiting to conduct me to the</p>
<p>village of Villiers, whither, he said, Forsyth had been called to</p>
<p>make some explanation about his passport, which did not appear to be</p>
<p>in satisfactory shape.  Accordingly we started for Villiers, and</p>
<p>Havelock, being well mounted on an English &quot;hunter,&quot; and wishing to</p>
<p>give me an exhibition of the animal&#x27;s training and power, led the way</p>
<p>across ditches and fences, but my horse, never having followed &quot;the</p>
<p>hounds,&quot; was unsafe to experiment with, so, after trying a low fence</p>
<p>or two, I decided to leave my friend alone in his diversion, and a</p>
<p>few moments later, seeing both horse and rider go down before a ditch</p>
<p>and high stone wall, I was convinced that my resolution was a</p>
<p>discreet one.  After this mishap, which luckily resulted in no harm,</p>
<p>I hoped Sir Henry would give up the amusement, but by failure</p>
<p>becoming only the more determined, in a second effort he cleared the</p>
<p>wall handsomely and rode across-country to the villages.  Following</p>
<p>the road till it passed under a railway bridge, I there thought I saw</p>
<p>a chance to gain Villiers by a short-cut, and changing my course</p>
<p>accordingly, I struck into a large vineyard to the left, and</p>
<p>proceeding a few hundred yards through the vines, came suddenly upon</p>
<p>a German picket-post.  The guard immediately leveled their rifles at</p>
<p>me, when, remembering my Rezonville experience of being taken for a</p>
<p>French officer because of my uniform, I hastily flung myself from the</p>
<p>saddle in token of surrender.  The action being rightly interpreted,</p>
<p>the men held their fire, and as my next thought was the King&#x27;s pass I</p>
<p>reached under my coat-skirt for the document, but this motion being</p>
<p>taken as a grab for my pistol, the whole lot of them--some ten in</p>
<p>number--again aimed at me, and with such loud demands for surrender</p>
<p>that I threw up my hands and ran into their ranks.  The officer of</p>
<p>the guard then coming up, examined my credentials, and seeing that</p>
<p>they were signed by the King of Prussia, released me and directed the</p>
<p>recovery of my horse, which was soon caught, and I was then conducted</p>
<p>to the quarters of the commandant, where I found Forsyth with his</p>
<p>pass properly vised, entirely ignorant of my troubles, and</p>
<p>contentedly regaling himself on cheese and beer.  Havelock having got</p>
<p>to the village ahead of me, thanks to his cross-country ride, was</p>
<p>there too, sipping beer with Forsyth; nor was I slow to follow their</p>
<p>example, for the ride of the day, though rather barren in other</p>
<p>results, at any rate had given me a ravenous appetite.</p>
<p>Late that evening, the 20th, we resumed our old quarters at Lagny,</p>
<p>and early next day I made a visit to the royal headquarters at</p>
<p>Ferrires, where I observed great rejoicing going on, the occasion for</p>
<p>it being an important victory gained near Mendon, a French corps of</p>
<p>about 30,000 men under General Ducrot having been beaten by the Fifth</p>
<p>Prussian and Second Bavarian corps.  Ducrot had been stubbornly</p>
<p>holding ground near Mendon for two or three days, much to the</p>
<p>embarrassment of the Germans too, since he kept them from closing a</p>
<p>gap in their line to the southwest of Paris; but in the recent fight</p>
<p>he had been driven from the field with such heavy loss as to render</p>
<p>impossible his maintaining the gap longer.  The Crown Prince of</p>
<p>Prussia was thus enabled to extend his left, without danger, as far</p>
<p>as Bougival, north of Versailles, and eventually met the right of the</p>
<p>Crown Prince of Saxony, already at Denil, north of St. Denis.  The</p>
<p>unbroken circle of investment around Paris being well-nigh assured,</p>
<p>news of its complete accomplishment was momentarily expected;</p>
<p>therefore everybody was jubilant on account of the breaking up of</p>
<p>Ducrot, but more particularly because word had been received the same</p>
<p>morning that a correspondence had begun between Bazaine and Prince</p>
<p>Frederick Charles, looking to the capitulation of Metz, for the</p>
<p>surrender of that place would permit the Second Army to join in the</p>
<p>siege of Paris.</p>
<p>Learning all this, and seeing that the investment was about</p>
<p>completed, I decided to take up my quarters at Versailles, and</p>
<p>started for that place on the 22d, halting at Noisy le Grand to take</p>
<p>luncheon with some artillery officers, whose acquaintance we had made</p>
<p>the day of the surrender at Sedan.  During the meal I noticed two</p>
<p>American flags flying on a couple of houses near by.  Inquiring the</p>
<p>significance of this, I was told that the flags had been put up to</p>
<p>protect the buildings--the owners, two American citizens, having in a</p>
<p>bad fright abandoned their property, and, instead of remaining</p>
<p>outside, gone into Paris,--&quot;very foolishly,&quot; said our hospitable</p>
<p>friends, &quot;for here they could have obtained food in plenty, and been</p>
<p>perfectly secure from molestation.&quot;</p>
<p>We arrived at Versailles about 7 o&#x27;clock that evening and settled</p>
<p>ourselves in the Hotel Reservoir, happy to find there two or three</p>
<p>American families, with whom, of course, we quickly made</p>
<p>acquaintance.  This American circle was enlarged a few days later by</p>
<p>the arrival of General Wm. B. Hazen, of our army, General Ambrose E.</p>
<p>Burnside, and Mr. Paul Forbes.  Burnside and Forbes were hot to see,</p>
<p>from the French side, something of the war, and being almost beside</p>
<p>themselves to get into Paris, a permit was granted them by Count</p>
<p>Bismarck, and they set out by way of Sevres, Forsyth and I</p>
<p>accompanying them as far as the Palace of St. Cloud, which we,</p>
<p>proposed to see, though there were strict orders against its being</p>
<p>visited generally.  After much trouble we managed, through the &quot;open</p>
<p>sesame&quot; of the King&#x27;s pass, to gain access to the palace; but to our</p>
<p>great disappointment we found that all the pictures had been cut from</p>
<p>the frames and carried off to Paris, except one portrait, that of</p>
<p>Queen Victoria, against whom the French were much incensed.  All</p>
<p>other works of art had been removed, too--a most fortunate</p>
<p>circumstance, for the palace being directly on the German line, was</p>
<p>raked by the guns from the fortress of Mont Valerien, and in a few</p>
<p>days burned to the ground.</p>
<p>In less than a week Burnside and Forbes returned from Paris.  They</p>
<p>told us their experience had been interesting, but were very reticent</p>
<p>as to particulars, and though we tried hard to find out what they had</p>
<p>seen or done, we could get nothing from them beyond the general</p>
<p>statement that they had had a good time, and that General Trochu had</p>
<p>been considerate enough to postpone a sortie, in order to let them</p>
<p>return; but this we did not quite swallow.  After a day or two they</p>
<p>went into Paris again, and I then began to suspect that they were</p>
<p>essaying the role of mediators, and that Count Bismarck was feeding</p>
<p>their vanity with permits, and receiving his equivalent by learning</p>
<p>the state of affairs within the beleaguered city.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From about the 1st of October on, the Germans were engaged in making</p>
</blockquote>
<p>their enveloping lines impenetrable, bringing up their reserves,</p>
<p>siege guns, and the like, the French meanwhile continuing to drill</p>
<p>and discipline the National Guard and relieving the monotony</p>
<p>occasionally by a more or less spirited, but invariably abortive,</p>
<p>sortie.  The most notable of these was that made by General Vinoy</p>
<p>against the heights of Clamart, the result being a disastrous repulse</p>
<p>by the besiegers.  After this, matters settled down to an almost</p>
<p>uninterrupted quietude, only a skirmish here and there; and it being</p>
<p>plain that the Germans did not intend to assault the capital, but</p>
<p>would accomplish its capture by starvation, I concluded to find out</p>
<p>from Count Bismarck about when the end was expected, with the purpose</p>
<p>of spending the interim in a little tour through some portions of</p>
<p>Europe undisturbed by war, returning in season for the capitulation.</p>
<p>Count Bismarck having kindly advised me as to the possible date,</p>
<p>Forsyth and I, on the 14th of October, left Versailles, going first</p>
<p>direct to the Chateau Ferrieres to pay our respects to the King,</p>
<p>which we did, and again took luncheon with him.  From the chateau we</p>
<p>drove to Meaux, and there spent the night; resuming our journey next</p>
<p>morning, we passed through Epernay, Rheims, and Rethel to Sedan,</p>
<p>where we tarried a day, and finally, on October 18, reached Brussels.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>
<p>BRUSSELS--DECIDING TO VISIT EASTERN EUROPE--AUSTRIA--DOWN THE DANUBE-</p>
<p>-IN CONSTANTINOPLE--THE LADIES OF THE HAREM--THE SULTAN--TURKISH</p>
<p>SOLDIERS--A BANQUET--A VISIT IN ATHENS--KING GEORGE OF GREECE--VICTOR</p>

<p>DINNER--RETURN TO VERSAILLES--GERMANS ENTERING PARIS--CRITICISM ON</p>
<p>THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR--CONCLUSION.</p>
<p>On reaching Brussels, one of the first things to do was to pay my</p>
<p>respects to the King of Belgium, which I did, accompanied by our</p>
<p>Minister, Mr. Russell Jones.  Later I dined with the King and Queen,</p>
<p>meeting at the dinner many notable people, among them the Count and</p>
<p>Countess of Flanders.  A day or two in Brussels sufficed to mature</p>
<p>our plans for spending the time up to the approximate date of our</p>
<p>return to Paris; and deciding to visit eastern Europe, we made Vienna</p>
<p>our first objective, going there by way of Dresden.</p>
<p>At Vienna our Minister, Mr. John Jay, took charge of us--Forsyth was</p>
<p>still with me--and the few days&#x27; sojourn was full of interest.  The</p>
<p>Emperor being absent from the capital, we missed seeing him; but the</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Count von Beust, was very polite to us, and at his</p>
<p>house we had the pleasure of meeting at dinner Count Andrassy, the</p>
<p>Prime Minister of Hungary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Vienna we went to Buda-Pesth, the Hungarian capital; and thence,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>in a I small, crowded, and uncomfortable steamboat, down the Danube</p>
<p>to Rustchuck, whence we visited Bucharest--all who travel in eastern</p>
<p>Europe do so--and then directing our course southward, we went first</p>
<p>to Varna, and from that city by steamer through the Black Sea to</p>
<p>Constantinople.</p>
<p>We reached the Turkish capital at the time of Ramadan, the period of</p>
<p>the year (about a month) during which the Mohammedans are commanded</p>
<p>by the Koran to keep a rigorous fast every day from sunrise till</p>
<p>sunset.  All the followers of the Prophet were therefore busy with</p>
<p>their devotions--holding a revival, as it were; hence there was no</p>
<p>chance whatever to be presented to the Sultan, Abdul Aziz, it being</p>
<p>forbidden during the penitential season for him to receive</p>
<p>unbelievers, or in fact any one except the officials of his</p>
<p>household.  However, the Grand Vizier brought me many messages of</p>
<p>welcome, and arranged that I should be permitted to see and salute</p>
<p>his Serene Highness on the Esplanade as he rode by on horseback to</p>
<p>the mosque.</p>
<p>So, the second day after arrival, the Grand Vizier drove me in a</p>
<p>barouche to the Esplanade, where we took station about midway of its</p>
<p>length an hour or so before the Sultan was to appear.  Shortly after</p>
<p>we reached the Esplanade, carriages occupied by the women of the</p>
<p>Sultan&#x27;s harem began to appear, coming out from the palace grounds</p>
<p>and driving up and down the roadway.  Only a few of the women were</p>
<p>closely veiled, a majority of them wearing an apology for veiling,</p>
<p>merely a strip of white lace covering the forehead down to the</p>
<p>eyebrows.  Some were yellow, and some white-types of the Mongolian</p>
<p>and Caucasian races.  Now and then a pretty face was seen, rarely a</p>
<p>beautiful one.  Many were plump, even to corpulence, and these were</p>
<p>the closest veiled, being considered the greatest beauties I presume,</p>
<p>since with the Turk obesity is the chief element of comeliness.  As</p>
<p>the carriages passed along in review, every now and then an occupant,</p>
<p>unable or unwilling to repress her natural promptings, would indulge</p>
<p>in a mild flirtation, making overtures by casting demure side-</p>
<p>glances, throwing us coquettish kisses, or waving strings of amber</p>
<p>beads with significant gestures, seeming to say: &quot;Why don&#x27;t you</p>
<p>follow?&quot;  But this we could not do if we would, for the Esplanade</p>
<p>throughout its entire length was lined with soldiers, put there</p>
<p>especially to guard the harem first, and later, the Sultan on his</p>
<p>pilgrimage to the mosque.</p>
<p>But as it was now time for His Serene Highness to make his appearance</p>
<p>the carriages containing his wives drove off into the palace grounds,</p>
<p>which were inclosed by a high wall, leaving the Esplanade wholly</p>
<p>unencumbered except by the soldiers.  Down between the two ranks,</p>
<p>which were formed facing each other, came the Sultan on a white</p>
<p>steed--a beautiful Arabian--and having at his side his son, a boy</p>
<p>about ten or twelve years old, who was riding a pony, a diminutive</p>
<p>copy of his father&#x27;s mount, the two attended by a numerous body-</p>
<p>guard, dressed in gorgeous Oriental uniforms.  As the procession</p>
<p>passed our carriage, I, as pre-arranged, stood up and took off my</p>
<p>hat, His Serene Highness promptly acknowledging the salute by raising</p>
<p>his hand to the forehead.  This was all I saw of him, yet I received</p>
<p>every kindness at his hands, being permitted to see many of his</p>
<p>troops, to inspect all the ordnance, equipment, and other military</p>
<p>establishments about Constantinople, and to meet numbers of the high</p>
<p>functionaries of the Empire.</p>
<p>Among other compliments tendered through his direction, and which I</p>
<p>gladly accepted, was a review of all the troops then in Stamboul-</p>
<p>about 6,000--comprising infantry, cavalry, and artillery.</p>
<p>They were as fine looking a body of soldiers as I ever saw--well</p>
<p>armed and well clothed, the men all large and of sturdy appearance.</p>
<p>After the review we attended a grand military dinner given by the</p>
<p>Grand Vizier.  At the hour set for this banquet we presented</p>
<p>ourselves at the palace of the Grand Vizier, and being ushered into a</p>
<p>large drawing-room, found already assembled there the guests invited</p>
<p>to meet us.  Some few spoke French, and with these we managed to</p>
<p>exchange an occasional remark; but as the greater number stood about</p>
<p>in silence, the affair, thus far, was undeniably a little stiff.</p>
<p>Just before the dinner was announced, all the Turkish officers went</p>
<p>into an adjoining room, and turning their faces to the east,</p>
<p>prostrated themselves to the floor in prayer.  Then we were all</p>
<p>conducted to a large salon, where each being provided with a silver</p>
<p>ewer and basin, a little ball of highly perfumed soap and a napkin,</p>
<p>set out on small tables, each guest washed his hands.  Adjacent to</p>
<p>this salon was the dining-room, or, rather, the banqueting room, a</p>
<p>very large and artistically frescoed hall, in the centre of which</p>
<p>stood a crescent-shaped table, lighted with beautiful silver</p>
<p>candelabra, and tastefully decorated with flowers and fruits.  The</p>
<p>viands were all excellent; cooked, evidently, by a French chef, and</p>
<p>full justice was done the dishes, especially by the Turks, who, of</p>
<p>course, had been fasting all day.</p>
<p>At the close of the banquet, which consisted of not less than fifteen</p>
<p>courses, we withdrew to a smoking-room, where the coffee was served</p>
<p>and cigarettes and chibouks offered us--the latter a pipe having a</p>
<p>long flexible stem with an amber mouthpiece.  I chose the chibouk,</p>
<p>and as the stem of mine was studded with precious stones of enormous</p>
<p>value, I thought I should enjoy it the more; but the tobacco being</p>
<p>highly flavored with some sort of herbs, my smoke fell far short of</p>
<p>my anticipations.  The coffee was delicious, however, and I found</p>
<p>this to be the case wherever I went in Constantinople, whether in</p>
<p>making calls or at dinner, the custom of offering coffee and tobacco</p>
<p>on these occasions being universal.</p>
<p>The temptations to linger at Constantinople were many indeed, not the</p>
<p>least being the delightful climate; and as time pressed, we set out</p>
<p>with much regret on the return journey, stopping a few days at</p>
<p>Athens, whence we made several short excursions into the interior.</p>
<p>King George and Queen Olga made our stay in Athens one of extreme</p>
<p>interest and exceeding pleasure.  Throwing aside all ceremony, they</p>
<p>breakfasted and dined us informally, gave us a fine ball, and in</p>
<p>addition to these hospitalities showed us much personal attention,</p>
<p>his Majesty even calling upon me, and the Queen sending her children</p>
<p>to see us at our hotel.</p>
<p>Of course we visited all that remained of the city&#x27;s ancient</p>
<p>civilization--the Acropolis, temples, baths, towers, and the like;</p>
<p>nor did we oinit to view the spot where St. Paul once instructed the</p>
<p>Athenians in lessons of Christianity.  We traveled some little</p>
<p>through the country districts outside of Athens, and I noticed that</p>
<p>the peasantry, in point of picturesqueness of dress and color of</p>
<p>complexion, were not unlike the gypsies we see at times in America.</p>
<p>They had also much of the same shrewdness, and, as far as I could</p>
<p>learn, were generally wholly uneducated, ignorant, indeed, except as</p>
<p>to one subject--politics--which I was told came to them intuitively,</p>
<p>they taking to it, and a scramble for office, as naturally as a duck</p>
<p>to water.  In fact, this common faculty for politics seems a</p>
<p>connecting link between the ancient and modern Greek.</p>
<p>Leaving Athens with the pleasantest recollections, we sailed for</p>
<p>Messina, Sicily, and from there went to Naples, where we found many</p>
<p>old friends; among them Mr. Buchanan Reed, the artist and poet, and</p>
<p>Miss Brewster, as well as a score or more of others of our</p>
<p>countrymen, then or since distinguished, in art and letters at home</p>
<p>and abroad.  We remained some days in Naples, and during the time</p>
<p>went to Pompeii to witness a special excavation among the ruins of</p>
<p>the buried city, which search was instituted on account of our visit.</p>
<p>A number of ancient household articles were dug up, and one, a terra</p>
<p>cotta lamp bearing upon its crown in bas-relief the legend of &quot;Leda</p>
<p>and the Swan,&quot; was presented to me as a souvenir of the occasion,</p>
<p>though it is usual for the Government to place in its museums</p>
<p>everything of such value that is unearthed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Naples to Rome by rail was our next journey.  In the Eternal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>City we saw picture-galleries, churches, and ruins in plenty, but all</p>
<p>these have been so well described by hundreds of other travelers that</p>
<p>I shall not linger even to name them.  While at Rome we also</p>
<p>witnessed an overflow of the Tiber, that caused great suffering and</p>
<p>destroyed much property.  The next stage of our tour took us to</p>
<p>Venice, then to Florence--the capital of Italy--for although the</p>
<p>troops of the King of Italy had taken possession of Rome the</p>
<p>preceding September, the Government itself had not yet removed</p>
<p>thither.</p>
<p>At Florence, our Minister, Mr. Marsh, though suffering with a lame</p>
<p>foot, took me in charge, and in due course of time I was presented to</p>
<p>King Victor-Emmanuel.  His Majesty received me informally at his</p>
<p>palace in a small, stuffy room--his office, no doubt--and an untidy</p>
<p>one it was too.  He wore a loose blouse and very baggy trousers; a</p>
<p>comfortable suit, certainly, but not at all conducing to an ideal</p>
<p>kingliness of appearance.</p>
<p>His Majesty&#x27;s hobby was hunting, and no sooner had I made my bow than</p>
<p>he began a conversation on that subject, thrusting his hands nearly</p>
<p>up to the elbows into the pockets of his trousers.  He desired to</p>
<p>learn about the large game of America, particularly the buffalo, and</p>
<p>when I spoke of the herds of thousands and thousands I had seen on</p>
<p>the plains of western Kansas, he interrupted me to bemoan the fate</p>
<p>which kept him from visiting America to hunt, even going so far as to</p>
<p>say that &quot;he didn&#x27;t wish to be King of Italy, anyhow, but would much</p>
<p>prefer to pass his days hunting than be bedeviled with the cares of</p>
<p>state.&quot; On one of his estates, near Pisa, he had several large herds</p>
<p>of deer, many wild boars, and a great deal of other game. Of this</p>
<p>preserve he was very proud, and before we separated invited me to go</p>
<p>down there to shoot deer, adding that he would be there himself if he</p>
<p>could, but feared that a trip which he had to take to Milan would</p>
<p>interfere, though he wished me to go in any event.</p>
<p>I gladly accepted the invitation, and in two or three days was</p>
<p>notified when I would be expected at the estate.  At the designated</p>
<p>time I was escorted to Pisa by an aide-de-camp, and from there we</p>
<p>drove the few miles to the King&#x27;s chateau, where we fortified</p>
<p>ourselves for the work in hand by an elaborate and toothsome</p>
<p>breakfast of about ten courses.  Then in a carriage we set out for</p>
<p>the King&#x27;s stand in the hunting-grounds, accompanied by a crowd of</p>
<p>mounted game-keepers, who with great difficulty controlled the pack</p>
<p>of sixty or seventy hounds, the dogs and keepers together almost</p>
<p>driving me to distraction with their yelping and yelling.  On</p>
<p>reaching the stand, I was posted within about twenty&#x27; yards of a</p>
<p>long, high picket-fence, facing the fence and covered by two trees</p>
<p>very close together.  It was from behind these that the King usually</p>
<p>shot, and as I was provided with a double-barreled shot-gun, I</p>
<p>thought I could do well, especially since close in rear of me stood</p>
<p>two game-keepers to load and hand me a second gun when the first was</p>
<p>emptied.</p>
<p>Meantime the huntsmen and the hounds had made a circuit of the park</p>
<p>to drive up the game.  The yelps of the hounds drawing near, I</p>
<p>cautiously looked in the direction of the sound, and the next moment</p>
<p>saw a herd of deer close in to the fence, and coming down at full</p>
<p>speed.  Without a miss, I shot the four leading ones as they tried</p>
<p>to run the gauntlet, for in passing between the stand and the fence,</p>
<p>the innocent creatures were not more than ten to fifteen paces from</p>
<p>me.  At the fourth I stopped, but the gamekeepers insisted on more</p>
<p>butchery, saying, &quot;No one but the King ever did the like&quot; (I guess no</p>
<p>one else had ever had the chance), so, thus urged, I continued firing</p>
<p>till I had slaughtered eleven with eleven shots--an easy task with a</p>
<p>shot-gun and buckshot cartridges.</p>
<p>The &quot;hunt&quot; being ended--for with this I had had enough, and no one</p>
<p>else was permitted to do any shooting--the aide-decamp directed the</p>
<p>game to be sent to me in Florence, and we started for the chateau.</p>
<p>On the way back I saw a wild boar the first and only one I ever saw--</p>
<p>my attention being drawn to him by cries from some of the game-</p>
<p>keepers.  There was much commotion, the men pointing out the game and</p>
<p>shouting excitedly, &quot;See the wild boar!&quot; otherwise I should not have</p>
<p>known what was up, but now, looking in the indicated direction, I saw</p>
<p>scudding over the plain what appeared to me to be nothing but a</p>
<p>halfgrown black pig, or shoat.  He was not in much of a hurry either,</p>
<p>and gave no evidence of ferocity, yet it is said that this</p>
<p>insignificant looking animal is dangerous when hunted with the spear</p>
<p>--the customary way.  After an early dinner at the chateau we</p>
<p>returned to Florence, and my venison next day arriving, it was</p>
<p>distributed among my American friends in the city.</p>
<p>Shortly after the hunt the King returned from Milan, and then honored</p>
<p>me with a military dinner, his Majesty and all the guests, numbering</p>
<p>eighty, appearing in full uniform.  The banqueting hall was lighted</p>
<p>with hundreds of wax candles, there was a profusion of beautiful</p>
<p>flowers, and to me the scene altogether was one of unusual</p>
<p>magnificence.  The table service was entirely of gold--the celebrated</p>
<p>set of the house of Savoy--and behind the chair of each guest stood a</p>
<p>servant in powdered wig and gorgeous livery of red plush.  I sat at</p>
<p>the right of the King, who--his hands resting on his sword, the hilt</p>
<p>of which glittered with jewels--sat through the hour and a half at</p>
<p>table without once tasting food or drink, for it was his rule to eat</p>
<p>but two meals in twenty-four hours--breakfast at noon, and dinner at</p>
<p>midnight.  The King remained silent most of the time, but when he did</p>
<p>speak, no matter on what subject, he inevitably drifted back to</p>
<p>hunting.  He never once referred to the Franco-Prussian war, nor to</p>
<p>the political situation in his own country, then passing through a</p>
<p>crisis.  In taking leave of his Majesty I thanked him with deep</p>
<p>gratitude for honoring me so highly, and his response was that if</p>
<p>ever he came to America to hunt buffalo, he should demand my</p>
<p>assistance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From Florence I went to Milan and Geneva, then to Nice, Marseilles,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Bordeaux.  Assembled at Bordeaux was a convention which had been</p>
<p>called together by the government of the National Defense for the</p>
<p>purpose of confirming or rejecting the terms of an armistice of</p>
<p>twenty-one days, arranged between Jules Favre and Count Bismarck in</p>
<p>negotiations begun at Versailles the latter part of January.  The</p>
<p>convention was a large body, chosen from all parts of France, and was</p>
<p>unquestionably the most noisy, unruly and unreasonable set of beings</p>
<p>that I ever saw in a legislative assembly.  The frequent efforts of</p>
<p>Thiers, Jules Favre, and other leading men to restrain the more</p>
<p>impetuous were of little avail.  When at the sittings a delegate</p>
<p>arose to speak on some question, he was often violently pulled to his</p>
<p>seat and then surrounded by a mob of his colleagues, who would throw</p>
<p>off their coats and gesticulate wildly, as though about to fight.</p>
<p>But the bitter pill of defeat had to be swallowed in some way, so the</p>
<p>convention delegated M. Thiers to represent the executive power of</p>
<p>the country, with authority to construct a ministry three</p>
<p>commissioners were appointed by the Executive, to enter into further</p>
<p>negotiations with Count Bismarck at Versailles and arrange a peace,</p>
<p>the terms of which, however, were to be submitted to the convention</p>
<p>for final action.  Though there had been so much discussion, it took</p>
<p>but a few days to draw up and sign a treaty at Versailles, the</p>
<p>principal negotiators being Thiers and Jules Favre for France, and</p>
<p>Bismarck on the part of the Germans.  The terms agreed upon provided</p>
<p>for the occupation of Paris till ratification should be had by the</p>
<p>convention at Bordeaux; learning of which stipulation from our</p>
<p>Minister, Mr. Washburn, I hurried off to Paris to see the conquerors</p>
<p>make their triumphal entry.</p>
<p>In the city the excitement was at fever heat, of course; the entire</p>
<p>population protesting with one voice that they would never, never</p>
<p>look upon the hated Germans marching through their beloved city.  No!</p>
<p>when the day arrived they would hide themselves in their houses, or</p>
<p>shut their eyes to such a hateful sight.  But by the 1st of March a</p>
<p>change had come over the fickle Parisians, for at an early hour the</p>
<p>sidewalks were jammed with people, and the windows and doors of the</p>
<p>houses filled with men, women, and children eager to get a look at</p>
<p>the conquerors.  Only a few came in the morning, however--an advance-</p>
<p>-guard of perhaps a thousand cavalry and infantry.  The main column</p>
<p>marched from the Arc-de-Triomphe toward the middle of the afternoon.</p>
<p>In its composition it represented United Germany--Saxons, Bavarians,</p>
<p>and the Royal Guard of Prussia--and, to the strains of martial music,</p>
<p>moving down the Champ Elysees to the Place de la Concorde, was</p>
<p>distributed thence over certain sections of the city agreed upon</p>
<p>beforehand.  Nothing that could be called a disturbance took place</p>
<p>during the march; and though there was a hiss now and then and</p>
<p>murmurings of discontent, yet the most noteworthy mutterings were</p>
<p>directed against the defunct Empire.  Indeed, I found everywhere that</p>
<p>the national misfortunes were laid at Napoleon&#x27;s door--he, by this</p>
<p>time, having become a scapegoat for every blunder of the war.</p>
<p>The Emperor William (he had been proclaimed German Emperor at</p>
<p>Versailles the 18th of January) did not accompany his troops into</p>
<p>Paris, though he reviewed them at Long Champs before they started.</p>
<p>After the occupation of the city he still remained at Versailles, and</p>
<p>as soon as circumstances would permit, I repaired to the Imperial</p>
<p>headquarters to pay my respects to his Majesty under his new title</p>
<p>and dignities, and to say good-bye.</p>
<p>Besides the Emperor, the only persons I me at Versailles were General</p>
<p>von Moltke and Bismarck.  His Majesty was in a very agreeable frame</p>
<p>of mind, and as bluff and hearty as usual.  His increased rank and</p>
<p>power had effected no noticeable change of any kind in him, and by</p>
<p>his genial and cordial ways he made me think that my presence with</p>
<p>the German army had contributed to his pleasure.  Whether this was</p>
<p>really so or not, I shall always believe it true, for his kind words</p>
<p>and sincere manner could leave no other conclusion.</p>
<p>General von Moltke was, as usual, quiet and reserved, betraying not</p>
<p>the slightest consciousness of his great ability, nor the least</p>
<p>indication of pride on account of his mighty work.  I say this</p>
<p>advisedly, for it is an undoubted fact that it was.  his marvelous</p>
<p>mind that perfected the military system by which 800,000 men were</p>
<p>mobilized with unparalleled celerity and moved with such certainty of</p>
<p>combination that, in a campaign of seven months, the military power</p>
<p>of France was destroyed and her vast resources sorely crippled.</p>
<p>I said good-bye to Count Bismarck, also, for at that busy time the</p>
<p>chances of seeing him again were very remote.  The great Chancellor</p>
<p>manifested more joy over the success of the Germans than did anyone</p>
<p>else at the Imperial headquarters.  Along with his towering strength</p>
<p>of mind and body, his character partook of much of the enthusiasm and</p>
<p>impulsiveness commonly restricted to younger men, and now in his</p>
<p>frank, free way be plainly showed his light-heartedness and</p>
<p>gratification at success.  That which for years his genius had been</p>
<p>planning and striving for--permanent unification of the German</p>
<p>States, had been accomplished by the war.  It had welded them</p>
<p>together in a compact Empire which no power in Europe could disrupt,</p>
<p>and as such a union was the aim of Bismarck&#x27;s life, he surely had a</p>
<p>right to feel jubilant.</p>
<p>Thanks to the courtesies extended me, I had been able to observe the</p>
<p>principal battles, and study many of the minor details of a war</p>
<p>between two of the greatest military nations of the world, and to</p>
<p>examine critically the methods followed abroad for subsisting,</p>
<p>equipping, and manoeuvring vast bodies of men during a stupendous,</p>
<p>campaign.  Of course I found a great deal to interest and instruct</p>
<p>me, yet nowadays war is pretty much the same everywhere, and this one</p>
<p>offered no marked exception to my previous experiences.  The methods</p>
<p>pursued on the march were the same as we would employ, with one most</p>
<p>important exception.  Owing to the density of population throughout</p>
<p>France it was always practicable for the Germans to quarter their</p>
<p>troops in villages, requiring the inhabitants to subsist both</p>
<p>officers and men.  Hence there was no necessity for camp and garrison</p>
<p>equipage, nor enormous provision trains, and the armies were</p>
<p>unencumbered by these impedimenta, indispensable when operating in a</p>
<p>poor and sparsely settled country.  As I have said before, the only</p>
<p>trains were those for ammunition, pontoon-boats, and the field</p>
<p>telegraph, and all these were managed by special corps.  If</p>
<p>transportation was needed for other purposes, it was obtained by</p>
<p>requisition from the invaded country, just as food and forage were</p>
<p>secured.  Great celerity of combination was therefore possible, the</p>
<p>columns moving in compact order, and as all the roads were broad and</p>
<p>macadamized, there was little or nothing to delay or obstruct the</p>
<p>march of the Germans, except when their enemy offered resistance, but</p>
<p>even this was generally slight and not very frequent, for the French</p>
<p>were discouraged by disaster from the very outset of the campaign</p>
<p>The earlier advantages gained bythe Germans may be ascribed to the</p>
<p>strikingly prompt mobilization of their armies, one of the most</p>
<p>noticeable features of their perfect military system, devised by</p>
<p>almost autocratic power; their later successes were greatly aided by</p>
<p>the blunders of the French, whose stupendous errors materially</p>
<p>shortened the war, though even if prolonged it could, in my opinion,</p>
<p>have had ultimately no other termination.</p>
<p>As I have previously stated, the first of these blunders was the</p>
<p>acceptance of battle by MacMahon at Worth; the second in attaching</p>
<p>too much importance to the fortified position of Metz, resulting in</p>
<p>three battles Colombey, Mars-la-Tour, and Gravelotte--all of which</p>
<p>were lost; and the third, the absurd movement of MacMahon along the</p>
<p>Belgian frontier to relieve Metz, the responsibility for which, I am</p>
<p>glad to say, does not belong to him.</p>
<p>With the hemming in of Bazaine at Metz and the capture of MacMahon&#x27;s</p>
<p>army at Sedan the crisis of the war was passed, and the Germans</p>
<p>practically the victors.  The taking of Paris was but a sentiment--</p>
<p>the money levy could have been made and the Rhine provinces held</p>
<p>without molesting that city, and only the political influences</p>
<p>consequent upon the changes in the French Government caused peace to</p>
<p>be deferred.</p>
<p>I did not have much opportunity to observe the German cavalry, either</p>
<p>on the march or in battle.  The only time I saw any of it engaged was</p>
<p>in the unfortunate charge at Gravelotte.  That proved its mettle good</p>
<p>and discipline fair, but answered no other purpose.  Such of it as</p>
<p>was not attached to the infantry was organized in divisions, and</p>
<p>operated in accordance with the old idea of covering the front and</p>
<p>flanks of the army, a duty which it thoroughly performed.  But thus</p>
<p>directed it was in no sense an independent corps, and hence cannot</p>
<p>be, said to have accomplished anything in the campaign, or have had a</p>
<p>weight or influence at all proportionate to its strength.  The method</p>
<p>of its employment seemed to me a mistake, for, being numerically</p>
<p>superior to the French cavalry, had it been massed and manoeuvred</p>
<p>independently of the infantry, it could easily have broken up the</p>
<p>French communications, and done much other work of weighty influence</p>
<p>in the prosecution of the war.</p>
<p>The infantry was as fine as I ever saw, the men young and hardy in</p>
<p>appearance, and marching always with an elastic stride.  The infantry</p>
<p>regiment, however, I thought too large--too many men for a colonel to</p>
<p>command unless he has the staff of a general--but this objection may</p>
<p>be counterbalanced by the advantages resulting from associating</p>
<p>together thus intimately the men from the same district, or county as</p>
<p>we would call it; the celerity of mobilization, and, in truth, the</p>
<p>very foundation of the German system, being based on this local or</p>
<p>territorial scheme of recruiting.</p>
<p>There was no delay when the call sounded for the march; all turned</p>
<p>out promptly, and while on the road there was very little straggling,</p>
<p>only the sick falling out.  But on such fine, smooth roads, and with</p>
<p>success animating the men from the day they struck the first blow, it</p>
<p>could hardly be expected that the columns would not keep well closed</p>
<p>up.  Then, too, it must be borne in mind that, as already stated,</p>
<p>&#x27;campaigning&#x27; in France--that is, the marching, camping, and</p>
<p>subsisting of an army--is an easy matter, very unlike anything we,</p>
<p>had during the war of the rebellion.  To repeat: the country is rich,</p>
<p>beautiful, and densely populated, subsistence abundant, and the</p>
<p>roads--all macadamized highways; thus the conditions; are altogether</p>
<p>different from those existing with us.  I think that under the same</p>
<p>circumstances our troops would have done as well as the Germans,</p>
<p>marched as admirably, made combinations as quickly and accurately,,</p>
<p>and fought with as much success.  I can but leave to conjecture how.</p>
<p>the Germans would have got along on bottomless roads--often none at</p>
<p>all--through the swamps and quicksands of northern Virginia, from,</p>
<p>the Wilderness to Petersburg, and from Chattanooga to Atlanta and the</p>
<p>sea.</p>
<p>Following the operations of the German armies from the battle of</p>
<p>Gravelotte to the siege of Paris, I may, in conclusion, say that I</p>
<p>saw no new military principles developed, whether of strategy or</p>
<p>grand tactics, the movements of the different armies and corps being</p>
<p>dictated and governed by the same general laws that have so long</p>
<p>obtained, simplicity of combination and manoeuvre, and the</p>
<p>concentration of a numerically superior force at the vital point.</p>
<p>After my brief trip to Versailles, I remained in Paris till the</p>
<p>latter part of March.  In company with Mr. Washburn, I visited the</p>
<p>fortifications for the defense of the city, and found them to be</p>
<p>exceptionally heavy; so strong, indeed, that it would have been very</p>
<p>hard to carry the place by a general assault.  The Germans, knowing</p>
<p>the character of the works, had refrained from the sacrifice of life</p>
<p>that such an attempt must entail, though they well knew that many of</p>
<p>the forts were manned by unseasoned soldiers.  With only a combat</p>
<p>here and there, to tighten their lines or repulse a sortie, they</p>
<p>wisely preferred to wait till starvation should do the work with</p>
<p>little loss and absolute certainty.</p>
<p>The Germans were withdrawn from Paris on the 3d of March, and no</p>
<p>sooner were they gone than factional quarrels, which had been going</p>
<p>on at intervals ever since the flight of the Empress and the fall of</p>
<p>her regency on the 4th of September, were renewed with revolutionary</p>
<p>methods that eventually brought about the Commune.  Having witnessed</p>
<p>one or two of these outbreaks, and concluding that while such</p>
<p>turbulence reigned in the city it would be of little profit for me to</p>
<p>tarry there, I decided to devote the rest of the time I could be away</p>
<p>from home to travel in England, Ireland, and Scotland.  My journeys</p>
<p>through those countries were full of pleasure and instruction, but as</p>
<p>nothing I saw or did was markedly different from what has been so</p>
<p>often described by others, I will save the reader this part of my</p>
<p>experience.  I returned to America in the fall, having been absent a</p>
<p>little more than a year, and although I saw much abroad of absorbing</p>
<p>interest, both professional and general, yet I came back to my native</p>
<p>land with even a greater love for her, and with increased admiration</p>
<p>for her institutions.</p>
