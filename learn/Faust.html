<p>Introductory Note</p>
<p>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the greatest of German men of letters, was
born at Frankfort-on-the-Main, August 28, 1749. His father was a man of
means and position, and he personally supervised the early education of his
son. The young Goethe studied at the universities of Leipsig and Strasburg,
and in 1772 entered upon the practise of law at Wetzlar. At the invitation of
Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, he went in 1775 to live in Weimar,
where he held a succession of political offices, becoming the Duke&#x27;s chief
adviser. From 1786 to 1788 he traveled in Italy, and from 1791 to 1817
directed the ducal theater at Weimar. He took part in the wars against
France, 1792-3, and in the following year began his friendship with Schiller,
which lasted till the latter&#x27;s death in 1805. In 1806 he married Christiane
Vulpius. From about 1794 he devoted himself chiefly to literature, and after a
life of extraordinary productiveness died at Weimar, March 22, 1832. The
most important of Goethe&#x27;s works produced before he went to Weimar were
his tragedy &quot;Gotz von Berlichingen&quot; (1773), which first brought him fame, and
&quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther,&quot; a novel which obtained enormous
popularity during the so called &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; period. During the years at
Weimar before he knew Schiller he began &quot;Wilhelm Meister,&quot; wrote the
dramas, &quot;Iphigenie,&quot; &quot;Egmont,&quot; and &quot;Torquato Tasso,&quot; and his &quot;Reinecke
Fuchs.&quot; To the period of his friendship with Schiller belong the continuation of
&quot;Wilhelm Meister,&quot; the beautiful idyl of &quot;Hermann and Dorothea,&quot; and the
&quot;Roman Elegies.&quot; In the last period, between Schiller&#x27;s death in 1805 and his
own, appeared &quot;Faust,&quot; &quot;Elective Affinities,&quot; his autobiographical &quot;Dichtung
und Wahrheit&quot; (&quot;Poetry and Truth&quot;), his &quot;Italian Journey,&quot; much scientific
work, and a series of treatises on German Art.
Though the foregoing enumeration contains but a selection from the titles of
Goethe&#x27;s best known writings, it suffices to show the extraordinary fertility and
versatility of his genius. Rarely has a man of letters had so full and varied a life,
or been capable of so many-sided a development. His political and scientific
activities, though dwarfed in the eyes of our generation by his artistic
production, yet showed the adaptability of his talent in the most diverse
directions, and helped to give him that balance of temper and breadth of
vision in which he has been surpassed by no genius of the ancient or modern
world.
The greatest and most representative expression of Goethe&#x27;s powers is
without doubt to be found in his drama of &quot;Faust&quot;; but before dealing with
Goethe&#x27;s masterpiece, it is worth while to say something of the history of the
story on which it is founded - the most famous instance of the old and
widespread legend of the man who sold his soul to the devil. The historical
Dr. Faust seems to have been a self-called philosopher who traveled about
Germany in the first half of the sixteenth century, making money by the
practise of magic, fortune-telling, and pretended cures. He died mysteriously
about 1540, and a legend soon sprang up that the devil, by whose aid he
wrought his wonders, had finally carried him off. In 1587 a life of him
appeared, in which are attributed to him many marvelous exploits and in
which he is held up as an awful warning against the excessive desire for
secular learning and admiration for antique beauty which characterized the
humanist movement of the time. In this aspect the Faust legend is an
expression of early popular Protestantism, and of its antagonism to the
scientific and classical tendencies of the Renaissance.
While a succession of Faust books were appearing in Germany, the original
life was translated into English and dramatized by Marlowe. English players
brought Marlowe&#x27;s work back to Germany, where it was copied by German
actors, degenerated into spectacular farce, and finally into a puppet show.
Through this puppet show Goethe made acquaintance with the legend.
By the time that Goethe was twenty, the Faust legend had fascinated his
imagination; for three years before he went to Weimar he had been working
on scattered scenes and bits of dialogue; and though he suspended actual
composition on it during three distinct periods, it was always to resume, and
he closed his labors upon it only with his life. Thus the period of time between
his first experiments and the final touches is more than sixty years. During this
period the plans for the structure and the signification of the work inevitably
underwent profound modifications, and these have naturally affected the unity
of the result; but, on the other hand, this long companionship and persistent
recurrence to the task from youth to old age have made it in a unique way the
record of Goethe&#x27;s personality in all its richness and diversity.
The drama was given to the public first as a fragment in 1790; then the
completed First Part appeared in 1808; and finally the Second Part was
published in 1833, the year after the author&#x27;s death. Writing in &quot;Dichtung und
Wahrheit&quot; of the period about 1770, when he was in Strasburg with Herder,
Goethe says, &quot;The significant puppet - play legend . . . echoed and buzzed in
many tones within me. I too had drifted about in all knowledge, and early
enough had been brought to feel the vanity of it. I too had made all sorts of
experiments in life, and had always come back more unsatisfied and more
tormented. I was now carrying these things, like many others, about with me
and delighting myself with them in lonely hours, but without writing anything
down.&quot; Without going into the details of the experience which underlies these
words, we can see the beginning of that sympathy with the hero of the old
story that was the basis of its fascination and that accounted for Goethe&#x27;s
departure from the traditional catastrophe of Faust&#x27;s damnation.
Hungarian March from the &quot;Damnation of Faust&quot;Op.24 by Hector
Berlioz(1803 - 1869).
Of the elements in the finished Faust that are derived from the legend a rough
idea may be obtained from the &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; of Marlowe, printed in the
present volume. As early as 1674 a life of Faust had contained the incident of
the philosopher&#x27;s falling in love with a servant - girl; but the developed story of
Gretchen is Goethe&#x27;s own. The other elements added to the plot can be noted
by a comparison with Marlowe.
It need hardly be said that Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; does not derive its greatness from
its conformity to the traditional standards of what a tragedy should be. He
himself was accustomed to refer to it cynically as a monstrosity, and yet he
put himself into it as intensely as Dante put himself into &quot;The Divine Comedy.&quot;
A partial explanation of this apparent contradiction in the author&#x27;s attitude is to
be found in what has been said of its manner of composition. Goethe began it
in his romantic youth, and availed himself recklessly of the supernatural
elements in the legend, with the disregard of reason and plausibility
characteristic of the romantic mood. When he returned to it in the beginning of
the new century his artistic standards has changed, and the supernaturalism
could now be tolerated only by being made symbolic. Thus he makes the
career of Faust as a whole emblematic of the triumph of the persistent striving
for the ideal over the temptation to find complete satisfaction in the sense, and
prepares the reader for this interpretation by prefixing the &quot;Prologue in
Heaven.&quot; The elaboration of this symbolic element is responsible for such
scenes as the Walpurgis - Night and the Intermezzo scenes full of power and
infinitely suggestive, but destructive of the unity of the play as a tragedy of
human life. Yet there remains in this First Part even in its final form much that
is realistic in the best sense, the carousal in Auerbach&#x27;s cellar, the portrait of
Martha, the Easter - morning walk, the character and fate of Margaret. It is
such elements as these that have appealed to the larger reading public and that
have naturally been emphasized by performance on the stage, and by virtue of
these alone &quot;Faust&quot; may rank as a great drama; but it is the result of Goethe&#x27;s
broodings on the mystery of human life, shadowed forth in the symbolic parts
and elaborated with still greater complexity and still more far - reaching
suggestiveness - and, it must be added, with deepening obscurity - in the
Second Part, that have given the work its place with &quot;Job,&quot; with the
&quot;Prometheus Bound,&quot; with &quot;The Divine Comedy,&quot; and with &quot;Hamlet.&quot;</p>
<p>The Tragedy Of Faust - Dedication
Ye wavering shapes, again ye do enfold me, As erst upon my troubled sight
ye stole; Shall I this time attempt to clasp, to hold ye? Still for the fond illusion
yearns my soul? Ye press around! Come then, your captive hold me, As
upward from the vapoury mist ye roll; Within my breast youth&#x27;s throbbing
pulse is bounding, Fann&#x27;d by the magic breath your march surrounding.
Shades fondly loved appear, your train attending, And visions fair of many a
blissful day; First - love and friendship their fond accents blending, Like to
some ancient, half - expiring lay; Sorrow revives, her wail of anguish sending
Back o&#x27;er life&#x27;s devious labyrinthine way, And names the dear ones, they
whom Fate bereaving Of life&#x27;s fair hours, left me behind them grieving.
They hear me not my later cadence singing, The souls to whom my earlier lays
I sang; Dispersed the throng, their severed flight now winging; Mute are the
voices that responsive rang. For stranger crowds the Orphean lyre now
stringing, E&#x27;en their applause is to my heart a pang; Of old who listened to my
song, glad hearted, If yet they live, now wander widely parted.
A yearning long unfelt, each impulse swaying, To yon calm spirit - realm
uplifts my soul; In faltering cadence, as when Zephyr playing, Fans the
Aeolian harp, my numbers roll; Tear follows tear, my steadfast heart obeying
The tender impulse, loses its control; What I possess as from afar I see;
Those I have lost become realities to me.
Prologue For The Theatre
Manager. Dramatic Poet. Merryman.
Manager
Ye twain, in trouble and distress True friends whom I so oft have found, Say,
for our scheme on German ground, What prospect have we of success? Fain
would I please the public, win their thanks; They live and let live, hence it is
but meet. The posts are now erected, and the planks, And all look forward to
a festal treat. Their places taken, they, with eyebrows rais&#x27;d, Sit patiently, and
fain would be amaz&#x27;d. I know the art to hit the public taste, Yet ne&#x27;er of failure
felt so keen a dread; True, they are not accustomed to the best, But then
appalling the amount they&#x27;ve read. How make our entertainment striking, new,
And yet significant and pleasing too? For to be plain, I love to see the throng,
As to our booth the living tide progresses; As wave on wave successive rolls
along, And through heaven&#x27;s narrow portal forceful presses; Still in broad
daylight, ere the clock strikes four, With blows their way towards the box
they take; And, as for bread in famine, at the baker&#x27;s door, For tickets are
content their necks to break. Such various minds the bard alone can sway,
My friend, oh work this miracle to - day!
Poet
Oh of the motley throng speak not before me, At whose aspect the Spirit
wings its flight! Conceal the surging concourse, I implore thee, Whose vortex
draws us with resistless might. No, to some peaceful heavenly nook restore
me, Where only for the bard blooms pure delight, Where love and friendship
yield their choicest blessing, Our heart&#x27;s true bliss, with god - like hand
caressing.
What in the spirit&#x27;s depths was there created, What shyly there the lip shaped
forth in sound; A failure now, with words now fitly mated, In the wild tumult
of the hour is drown&#x27;d; Full oft the poet&#x27;s thought for years hath waited Until
at length with perfect form &#x27;tis crowned; What dazzles, for the moment born,
must perish; What genuine is posterity will cherish.
Merryman
This cant about posterity I hate; About posterity were I to prate, Who then
the living would amuse? For they Will have diversion, ay, and &#x27;tis their due. A
sprightly fellow&#x27;s presence at your play, Methinks should also count for
something too; Whose genial wit the audience still inspires, Knows from their
changeful mood no angry feeling; A wider circle he desires, To their heart&#x27;s
depths more surely thus appealing. To work, then! Give a master - piece, my
friend; Bring Fancy with her choral trains before us, Sense, reason, feeling,
passion, but attend! Let folly also swell the tragic chorus.
Manager
In chief, of incident enough prepare! A show they want, they come to gape
and stare. Spin for their eyes abundant occupation, So that the multitude may
wondering gaze, You by sheer bulk have won your reputation, The man you
are all love to praise. By mass alone can you subdue the masses, Each then
selects in time what suits his bent. Bring much, you something bring for various
classes, And from the house goes every one content. You give a piece,
abroad in pieces send it! &#x27;Tis a ragout - success must needs attend it; &#x27;Tis easy
to serve up, as easy to invent. A finish&#x27;d whole what boots it to present! Full
soon the public will in pieces rend it.
Poet
How mean such handicraft as this you cannot feel! How it revolts the genuine
artist&#x27;s mind! The sorry trash in which these coxcombs deal, Is here approved
on principle, I find.
Manager
Such a reproof disturbs me not a whit! Who on efficient work is bent, Must
choose the fittest instrument. Consider! &#x27;tis soft wood you have to split; Think
too for whom you write, I pray! One comes to while an hour away; One from
the festive board, a sated guest; Others, more dreaded than the rest, From
journal - reading hurry to the play. As to a masquerade, with absent minds,
they press, Sheer curiosity their footsteps winging; Ladies display their
persons and their dress, Actors unpaid their service bringing. What dreams
beguile you on your poet&#x27;s height? What puts a full house in a merry mood?
More closely view your patrons of the night! The half are cold, the half are
rude. One, the play over, craves a game of cards; Another a wild night in
wanton joy would spend. Poor fools the muses&#x27; fair regards. Why court for
such a paltry end? I tell you, give them more, still more &#x27;tis all I ask, Thus you
will ne&#x27;er stray widely from the goal; Your audience seek to mystify cajole; To
satisfy them - that&#x27;s a harder task. What ails thee? art enraptured or
distressed?
Poet
Depart! elsewhere another servant choose What! shall the bard his godlike
power abuse? Man&#x27;s loftiest right, kind nature&#x27;s high bequest, For your mean
purpose basely sport away? Whence comes his mastery o&#x27;er the human
breast, Whence o&#x27;er the elements his sway, But from the harmony that,
gushing from his soul, Draws back into his heart the wondrous whole? With
careless hand when round her spindle, Nature Winds the interminable thread
of life; When &#x27;mid the clash of Being every creature Mingles in harsh
inextricable strife; Who deals their course unvaried till it falleth, In rhythmic
flow to music&#x27;s measur&#x27;d tone? Each solitary note whose genius calleth, To
swell the mighty choir in unison? Who in the raging storm sees passion
low&#x27;ring? Or flush of earnest thought in evening&#x27;s glow? Who every blossom in
sweet spring - time flowering Along the loved one&#x27;s path would strow? Who,
Nature&#x27;s green familiar leaves entwining, Wreathe&#x27;s glory&#x27;s garland, won on
every field? Makes sure Olympus, heavenly powers combining? Man&#x27;s mighty
spirit, in the bard reveal&#x27;d!
Merryman
Come then, employ your lofty inspiration, And carry on the poet&#x27;s avocation,
Just as we carry on a love affair. Two meet by chance, are pleased, they
linger there, Insensibly are link&#x27;d, they scarce know how; Fortune seems now
propitious, adverse now, Then come alternate rapture and despair; And &#x27;tis a
true romance ere one&#x27;s aware. Just such a drama let us now compose. Plunge
boldly into life - its depths disclose! Each lives it, not to many is it known,
&#x27;Twill interest wheresoever seiz&#x27;d and shown; Bright pictures, but obscure
their meaning: A ray of truth through error gleaming, Thus you the best elixir
brew, To charm mankind, and edify them too. Then youth&#x27;s fair blossoms
crowd to view your play, And wait as on an oracle; while they, The tender
souls, who love the melting mood, Suck from your work their melancholy
food; Now this one, and now that, you deeply stir, Each sees the working of
his heart laid bare. Their tears, their laughter, you command with ease, The
lofty still they honour, the illusive love. Your finish&#x27;d gentlemen you ne&#x27;er can
please; A growing mind alone will grateful prove.
Poet
Then give me back youth&#x27;s golden prime, When my own spirit too was
growing, When from my heart th&#x27; unbidden rhyme Gush&#x27;d forth, a fount for
ever flowing; Then shadowy mist the world conceal&#x27;d, And every bud sweet
promise made, Of wonders yet to be reveal&#x27;d, As through the vales, with
blooms inlaid, Culling a thousand flowers I stray&#x27;d. Naught had I, yet a rich
profusion! The thirst for truth, joy in each fond illusion. Give me unquell&#x27;d
those impulses to prove; Rapture so deep, its ecstasy was pain, The power of
hate, the energy of love, Give me, oh give me back my youth again!
Merryman
Youth, my good friend, you certainly require When foes in battle round are
pressing, When a fair maid, her heart on fire, Hangs on your neck with fond
caressing, When from afar, the victor&#x27;s crown, To reach the hard - won goal
inciteth; When from the whirling dance, to drown Your sense, the night&#x27;s
carouse inviteth. But the familiar chords among Boldly to sweep, with graceful
cunning, While to its goal, the verse along Its winding path is sweetly running;
This task is yours, old gentlemen, to - day; Nor are you therefore less in
reverence held; Age does not make us childish, as folk say, It finds us genuine
children e&#x27;en in eld.</p>
<p>Manager
A truce to words, mere empty sound, Let deeds at length appear, my friends!
While idle compliments you round, You might achieve some useful ends. Why
talk of the poetic vein? Who hesitates will never know it; If bards ye are, as
ye maintain, Now let your inspiration show it. To you is known what we
require, Strong drink to sip is our desire; Come, brew me such without delay!
To - morrow sees undone, what happens not to - day; Still forward press,
nor ever tire! The possible, with steadfast trust, Resolve should be the
forelock grasp; Then she will ne&#x27;er let go her clasp, And labours on, because
she must.
On German boards, you&#x27;re well aware, The taste of each may have full sway;
Therefore in bringing out your play, Nor scenes nor mechanism spare!
Heaven&#x27;s lamps employ, the greatest and the least, Be lavish of the stellar
lights, Water, and fire, and rocky heights, Spare not at all, nor birds, nor
beast, Thus let creation&#x27;s ample sphere Forthwith in this our narrow booth
appear, And with considerate speed, through fancy&#x27;s spell, Journey from
heaven, thence through the world, to hell!
Prologue In Heaven
The Lord, The Heavenly Hosts. Afterwards Mephistopheles.
The three Archangels come forward
Raphael
The Sun, in ancient guise, competing With brother spheres in rival song, With
thunder - march, his orb completing, Moves his predestin&#x27;d course along; His
aspect to the powers supernal Gives strength, though fathom him none may;
Transcending thought, the works eternal Are fair as on the primal day.
Gabriel
With speed, thought baffling, unabating, Earth&#x27;s splendour whirls in circling
flight; Its Eden - brightness alternating With solemn, awe - inspiring night;
Ocean&#x27;s broad waves in wild commotion, Against the rocks&#x27; deep base are
hurled; And with the spheres, both rock and ocean Eternally are swiftly
whirled.
Michael
And tempests roar in emulation From sea to land, from land to sea, And
raging form, without cessation, A chain of wondrous agency, Full in the
thunder&#x27;s path careering, Flaring the swift destructions play; But, Lord, Thy
servants are revering The mild procession of thy day.
The Three
Thine aspect to the powers supernal Gives strength, though fathom thee none
may; And all they works, sublime, eternal, Are fair as on the primal day.
Mephistopheles
Since thou, O Lord, approachest us once more, And how it fares with us, to
ask art fain, Since thou hast kindly welcom&#x27;d me of yore, Thou see&#x27;st me also
now among thy train. Excuse me, fine harangues I cannot make, Though all
the circle look on me with scorn; My pathos soon thy laughter would awake,
Hadst thou the laughing mood not long forsworn. Of suns and worlds I
nothing have to say, I see alone mankind&#x27;s self - torturing pains. The little
world - god still the self - same stamp retains, And is as wondrous now as on
the primal day. Better he might have fared, poor wight, Hadst thou not given
him a gleam of heavenly light; Reason, he names it, and doth so Use it, than
brutes more brutish still to grow. With deference to your grace, he seems to
me Like any long - legged grasshopper to be, Which ever flies, and flying
springs, And in the grass its ancient ditty sings. Would he but always in the
grass repose! In every heap of dung he thrusts his nose.
The Lord
Hast thou naught else to say/ Is blame In coming here, as ever, thy sole aim?
Does nothing on the earth to thee seem right?
Mephistopheles
No, Lord! I find things there, as ever, in sad plight. Men, in their evil days,
move my compassion; Such sorry things to plague is nothing worth.
The Lord
Know&#x27;st thou my servant, Faust?
Mephistopheles
The doctor?
The Lord
Right.
Mephistopheles
He serves thee truly in a wondrous fashion. Poor fool! His food and drink are
not of earth. An inward impulse hurries him afar, Himself half conscious of his
frenzied mood; From heaven claimeth he the fairest star, And from the earth
craves every highest good, And all that&#x27;s near, and all that&#x27;s far, Fails to allay
the tumult in his blood.
The Lord
Though in perplexity he serves me now, I soon will lead him where more light
appears; When buds the sapling, doth the gardener know That flowers and
fruit will deck the coming years.
Mephistopheles
What wilt thou wager? Him thou yet shall lose, If leave to me thou wilt but
give, Gently to lead him as I choose!
The Lord
So long as he on earth doth live, So long &#x27;tis not forbidden thee. Man still must
err, while he doth strive.
Mephistopheles
I thank you; for not willingly I traffic with the dead, and still aver That youth&#x27;s
plump blooming cheek I very much prefer. I&#x27;m not at home to corpses; &#x27;tis my
way, Like cats with captive mice to toy and play.
The Lord
Enough! &#x27;tis granted thee! Divert This mortal spirit from his primal source;
Him, canst thou seize, thy power exert And lead him on thy downward
course, Then stand abash&#x27;d, when thou perforce must own, A good man in his
darkest aberration, Of the right path is conscious still.
Mephistopheles</p>
<p>&#x27;Tis done! Full soon thou&#x27;lt see my exultation; As for my bet no fears I
entertain. And if my end I finally should gain, Excuse my triumphing with all
my soul. Dust he shall eat, ay, and with relish take, As did my cousin, the
renowned snake.
The Lord
Here too thou&#x27;rt free to act without control; I ne&#x27;er have cherished hate for
such as thee. Of all the spirits who deny, The scoffer is least wearisome to
me. Ever too prone is man activity to shirk, In unconditioned rest he fain
would live; Hence this companion purposely I give, Who stirs, excites, and
must, as devil, work. But ye, the genuine sons of heaven, rejoice! In the full
living beauty still rejoice! May that which works and lives, the ever - growing,
In bonds of love enfold you, mercy - fraught, And Seeming&#x27;s changeful forms,
around you flowing, Do ye arrest, in ever - during thought!
(Heaven closes, the Archangels disperse.)
Mephistopheles (alone)
The ancient one I like sometimes to see, And not to break with him am
always civil; &#x27;Tis courteous in so great a lord as he, To speak so kindly even
to the devil.</p>

<p>I have, alas! Philosophy, Medicine, Jurisprudence too, And to my cost
Theology, With ardent labour, studied through. And here I stand, with all my
lore, Poor fool, no wiser than before. Magister, doctor styled, indeed,
Already these ten years I lead, Up, down, across, and to and fro, My pupils
by the nose, - and learn, That we in truth can nothing know! That in my heart
like fire doth burn. &#x27;Tis true I&#x27;ve more cunning than all your dull tribe, Magister
and doctor, priest, parson, and scribe; Scruple or doubt comes not to enthrall
me, Neither can devil nor hell now appal me Hence also my heart must all
pleasure forego! I may not pretend, aught rightly to know, I may not pretend,
through teaching, to find A means to improve or convert mankind. Then I
have neither goods nor treasure, No worldly honour, rank, or pleasure; No
dog in such fashion would longer live! Therefore myself to magic I give, In
hope, through spirit - voice and might, Secrets now veiled to bring to light,
That I no more, with aching brow, Need speak of what I nothing know; That
I the force may recognise That binds creation&#x27;s inmost energies; Her vital
powers, her embryo seeds survey, And fling the trade in empty words away.
O full - orb&#x27;d moon, did but thy rays Their last upon mine anguish gaze!
Beside this desk, at dead of night, Oft have I watched to hail thy light: Then,
pensive friend! o&#x27;er book and scroll, With soothing power, thy radiance stole!
In thy dear light, ah, might I climb, Freely, some mountain height sublime,
Round mountain caves with spirits ride, In thy mild haze o&#x27;er meadows glide,
And, purged from knowledge - fumes, renew My spirit, in thy healing dew!
Woe&#x27;s me! still prison&#x27;d in the gloom Of this abhorr&#x27;d and musty room! Where
heaven&#x27;s dear light itself doth pass, But dimly through the painted glass!
Hemmed in by volumes thick with dust, Worm - eaten, hid &#x27;neath rust and
mould, And to the high vault&#x27;s topmost bound, A smoke - stained paper
compassed round; With boxes round thee piled, and glass, And many a
useless instrument, With old ancestral lumber blent This is thy world! a world!
alas! And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart, With tighten&#x27;d pressure in thy
breast? Why the dull ache will not depart, By which thy life - pulse is
oppress&#x27;d? Instead of nature&#x27;s living sphere, Created for mankind of old,
Brute skeletons surround thee here, And dead men&#x27;s bones in smoke and
mould.
Up! Forth into the distant land! Is not this book of mystery By Nostradamus&#x27;
proper hand, An all - sufficient guide? Thou&#x27;lt see The courses of the stars
unroll&#x27;d; When nature doth her thoughts unfold To thee, thy soul shall rise, and
seek Communion high with her to hold, As spirit doth with spirit speak! Vain
by dull poring to divine The meaning of each hallow&#x27;d sign. Spirits! I feel you
hov&#x27;ring near; Make answer, if my voice ye hear!
(He opens the book and perceives the sign of the Macrocosmos.)
Ah! at this spectacle through every sense, What sudden ecstasy of joy is
flowing! I feel new rapture, hallow&#x27;d and intense, Through every nerve and
vein with ardour glowing. Was it a god who character&#x27;d this scroll, The tumult
in my spirit healing, O&#x27;er my sad heart with rapture stealing, And by a mystic
impulse, to my soul, The powers of nature all around revealing. Am I a God?
What light intense! In these pure symbols do I see, Nature exert her vital
energy. Now of the wise man&#x27;s words I learn the sense;
&quot;Unlock&#x27;d the spirit - world doth lie, Thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead! Up
scholar, lave, with courage high, Thine earthly breast in the morning - red!&quot;
(He contemplates the sign.)
How all things live and work, and ever blending, Weave one vast whole from
Being&#x27;s ample range! How powers celestial, rising and descending, Their
golden buckets ceaseless interchange! Their flight on rapture - breathing
pinions winging, From heaven to earth their genial influence bringing, Through
the wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing!
A wondrous show! but ah! a show alone! Where shall I grasp thee, infinite
nature, where? Ye breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon Hang heaven and
earth, from which the withered heart For solace yearns, ye still impart Your
sweet and fostering tides - where are ye - where? Ye gush, and must I
languish in despair?
(He turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, and perceives the sigh of
the Earth - spirit.)
How all unlike the influence of this sign! Earth - spirit, thou to me art nigher,
E&#x27;en now my strength is rising higher, E&#x27;en now I glow as with new wine;
Courage I feel, abroad the world to dare, The woe of earth, the bliss of earth
to bear, With storms to wrestle, brave the lightning&#x27;s glare, And mid the
crashing shipwreck not despair.
Clouds gather over me The moon conceals her light The lamp is quench&#x27;d
Vapours are rising - Quiv&#x27;ring round my head Flash the red beams - Down
from the vaulted roof A shuddering horror floats, And seizes me! I feel it,
spirit, prayer - compell&#x27;d, &#x27;tis thou Art hovering near! Unveil thyself! Ha! How
my heart is riven now! Each sense, with eager palpitation, Is strain&#x27;d to catch
some new sensation! I feel my heart surrender&#x27;d unto thee! Thou must! Thou
must! Though life should be the fee!
(He seizes the book, and pronounces mysteriously the sign of the spirit. A
ruddy flame flashes up; the spirit appears in the flame.)
Spirit
Who calls me?
Faust (turning aside) Dreadful shape! Spirit
With might,
Thou hast compelled me to appear, Long hast been sucking at my sphere,
And now
Dr. Johann Faust: Dr. Johann Faust watching a magic disc in his study.
Engraving by Rembrant.]
Faust
Woe&#x27;s me! I cannot bear thy sight!
Spirit
To see me thou dost breathe thine invocation, My voice to hear, to gaze upon
my brow; Me doth thy strong entreaty bow Lo! I am here! - What cowering
agitation Grasps thee, the demigod! Where&#x27;s now the soul&#x27;s deep cry? Where
is the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv&#x27;d And bore and cherished?
which, with ecstacy, To rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved? Where art
thou, Faust? whose voice I heard resound, Who towards me press&#x27;d with
energy profound? Art thou he? Thou, - who by my breath art blighted, Who,
in his spirit&#x27;s depths affrighted, Trembles, a crush&#x27;d and writhing worm!
Faust
Shall I yield, thing of flame, to thee? Faust, and thine equal, I am he!
Spirit
In the currents of life, in action&#x27;s storm, I float and I wave With billowy
motion! Birth and the grave A limitless ocean, A constant weaving With
change still rife, A restless heaving, A glowing life Thus time&#x27;s whirring loom
unceasing I ply, And weave the life - garment of deity.
Faust
Thou, restless spirit, dost from end to end O&#x27;ersweep the world; how near I
feel to thee!
Spirit
Thou&#x27;rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend, Not me!
(Vanishes.)
Faust (deeply moved)
Not thee? Whom then? I, Gods own image! And not rank with thee!
(A knock)
Oh death! I know it - &#x27;tis my famulus My fairest fortune now escapes! That all
these visionary shapes A soulless groveller should banish thus!
(Wagner in his dressing gown and night - cap, a lamp in his hand. Faust turns
round reluctantly.)
Wagner
Pardon! I heard you here declaim; A Grecian tragedy you doubtless read?
Improvement in this art is now my aim, For now - a - days it much avails.
Indeed An actor, oft I&#x27;ve heard it said, as teacher, May give instruction to a
preacher.
Faust
Ay, if your priest should be an actor too, As not improbably may come to
pass.
Wagner
When in his study pent the whole year through, Man views the world, as
through an optic glass, On a chance holiday, and scarcely then, How by
persuasion can he govern men?
Faust
If feeling prompt not, if it doth not flow Fresh from the spirit&#x27;s depths, with
strong control Swaying to rapture every listener&#x27;s soul, Idle your toil; the
chase you may forego! Brood o&#x27;er your task! Together glue, Cook from
another&#x27;s feast your own ragout, Still prosecute your paltry game, And fan
your ash - heaps into flame! Thus children&#x27;s wonder you&#x27;ll excite, And apes&#x27;, if
such your appetite; But that which issues from the heart alone, Will bend the
hearts of others to your own.
Wagner
The speaker in delivery will find Success alone; I still am far behind.
Faust
A worthy object still pursue! Be not a hollow tinkling fool! Sound
understanding, judgment true, Find utterance without art or rule; And when in
earnest you are moved to speak, Then is it needful cunning words to seek?
Your fine harangues, so polish&#x27;d in their kind, Wherein the shreds of human
thought ye twist, Are unrefreshing as the empty wind, Whistling through
wither&#x27;d leaves and autumn mist!
Wagner
Oh God! How long is art, Our life how short! With earnest zeal Still as I ply
the critic&#x27;s task, I feel A strange oppression both of head and heart. The very
means how hardly are they won, By which we to the fountains rise! And
haply, ere one half the course is run, Check&#x27;d in his progress, the poor devil
dies.
Faust
Parchment, is that the sacred fount whence roll Waters, he thirsteth not who
once hath quaffed? Oh, if it gush not from thine inmost soul, Thou has not won
the life - restoring draught.
Wagner
Your pardon! &#x27;tis delightful to transport Oneself into the spirit of the past, To
see in times before us how a wise man thought, And what a glorious height we
have achieved at last.
Faust
Ay truly! even to the loftiest star! To us, my friend, the ages that are pass&#x27;d A
book with seven seals, close - fasten&#x27;d, are; And what the spirit of the times
men call, Is merely their own spirit after all, Wherein, distorted oft, the times
are glass&#x27;d. Then truly, &#x27;tis a sight to grieve the soul! At the first glance we fly it
in dismay; A very lumber - room, a rubbish - hole; At best a sort of mock -
heroic play, With saws pragmatical, and maxims sage, To suit the puppets
and their mimic stage.
Wagner
But then the world and man, his heart and brain! Touching these things all men
would something know.
Faust
Ay! what &#x27;mong men as knowledge doth obtain! Who on the child its true
name dares bestow? The few who somewhat of these things have known,
Who their full hearts unguardedly reveal&#x27;d, Nor thoughts, nor feelings, from
the mob conceal&#x27;d, Have died on crosses, or in flames been thrown. Excuse
me, friend, far now the night is spent, For this time we must say adieu.
Wagner
Still to watch on I had been well content, Thus to converse so learnedly with
you. But as to - morrow will be Easter - day, Some further questions grant, I
pray; With diligence to study still I fondly cling; Already I know much, but
would know everything.
(Exit.)
Faust Soliloquy - Chorus Of Angels
Faust (alone)
How him alone all hope abandons never, To empty trash who clings, with zeal
untired, With greed for treasure gropes, and, joy - inspir&#x27;d, Exults if earth -
worms second his endeavour.
And dare a voice of merely human birth, E&#x27;en here, where shapes immortal
throng&#x27;d intrude? Yet ah! thou poorest of the sons of earth, For once, I e&#x27;en
to thee feel gratitude. Despair the power of sense did well - nigh blast, And
thou didst save me ere I sank dismay&#x27;d, So giant - like the vision seem&#x27;d, so
vast, I felt myself shrink dwarf&#x27;d as I survey&#x27;d!
I, God&#x27;s own image, from this toil of clay Already freed, with eager joy who
hail&#x27;d The mirror of eternal truth unveil&#x27;d, Mid light effulgent and celestial day:
I, more than cherub, whose unfetter&#x27;d soul With penetrative glance aspir&#x27;d to
flow Through nature&#x27;s veins, and, still creating, know The life of gods, - how
am I punish&#x27;d now! One thunder - word hath hurl&#x27;d me from the goal!
Spirit! I dare not lift me to thy sphere. What though my power compell&#x27;d thee
to appear, My art was powerless to detain thee here. In that great moment,
rapture - fraught, I felt myself so small, so great; Fiercely didst thrust me from
the realm of thought Back on humanity&#x27;s uncertain fate! Who&#x27;ll teach me now?
What ought I to forego? Ought I that impulse to obey? Alas! our every deed,
as well as every woe, Impedes the tenor of life&#x27;s onward way!
E&#x27;en to the noblest by the soul conceiv&#x27;d, Some feelings cling of baser quality;
And when the goods of this world are achiev&#x27;d, Each nobler aim is termed a
cheat, a lie. Our aspirations, our soul&#x27;s genuine life, Grow torpid in the din of
earthly strife. Though youthful phantasy, while hope inspires, Stretch o&#x27;er the
infinite her wing sublime, A narrow compass limits her desires, When wreck&#x27;d
our fortunes in the gulf of time. In the deep heart of man care builds her nest,
O&#x27;er secret woes she broodeth there, Sleepless she rocks herself and scareth
joy and rest; Still is she wont some new disguise to wear, She may as house
and court, as wife and child appear, As dagger, poison, fire and flood;
Imagined evils chill thy blood,
And what thou ne&#x27;er shall lose, o&#x27;er that dost shed the tear. I am not like the
gods! Feel it I must; I&#x27;m like the earth - worm, writhing in the dust, Which, as
on dust it feeds, its native fare, Crushed &#x27;neath the passer&#x27;s tread, lies buried
there.
Is it not dust, wherewith this lofty wall, With hundred shelves, confines me
round; Rubbish, in thousand shapes, may I not call What in this moth - world
doth my being bound? Here, what doth fail me, shall I find? Read in a
thousand tomes that, everywhere, Self - torture is the lot of human - kind,
With but one mortal happy, here and there? Thou hollow skull, that grin, what
should it say, But that thy brain, like mine, of old perplexed, Still yearning for
the truth, hath sought the light of day. And in the twilight wandered, sorely
vexed? Ye instruments, forsooth, ye mock at me, With wheel, and cog, and
ring, and cylinder; To nature&#x27;s portals ye should be the key; Cunning your
wards, and yet the bolts ye fail to stir. Inscrutable in broadest light, To be
unveil&#x27;d by force she doth refuse, What she reveals not to thy mental sight,
Thou wilt not wrest me from her with levers and with screws. Old useless
furnitures, yet stand ye here, Because my sire ye served, now dead and gone.
Old scroll, the smoke of years dost wear, So long as o&#x27;er this desk the sorry
lamp hath shone. Better my little means hath squandered quite away, Than
burden&#x27;d by that little here to sweat and groan! Wouldst thou possess thy
heritage, essay, By use to render it thine own! What we employ not, but
impedes our way, That which the hour creates, that can it use alone! But
wherefore to yon spot is riveted my gaze? Is yonder flasket there a magnet to
my sight? Whence this mild radiance that around me plays, As when, &#x27;mid
forest gloom, reigneth the moon&#x27;s soft light?
Hail precious phial! Thee, with reverent awe, Down from thine old receptacle
I draw! Science in thee I hail and human art. Essence of deadliest powers,
refin&#x27;d and sure, Of soothing anodynes abstraction pure, Now in thy master&#x27;s
need thy grace impart! I gaze on thee, my pain is lull&#x27;d to rest; I grasp thee,
calm&#x27;d the tumult in my breast; The flood - tide of my spirit ebbs away;
Onward I&#x27;m summon&#x27;d o&#x27;er a boundless main, Calm at my feet expands the
glassy plain, To shores unknown allures a brighter day.
Lo, where a car of fire, on airy pinion, Comes floating towards me! I&#x27;m
prepar&#x27;d to fly By a new track through ether&#x27;s wide dominion, To distant
spheres of pure activity. This life intense, this godlike ecstasy Worm that thou
art such rapture canst thou earn? Only resolve with courage stern and high,
Thy visage from the radiant sun to turn! Dare with determin&#x27;d will to burst the
portals Past which in terror others fain would steal! Now is the time, through
deeds, to show that mortals The calm sublimity of gods can feel; To shudder
not at yonder dark abyss, Where phantasy creates her own self - torturing
brood, Right onward to the yawning gulf to press, Around whose narrow
jaws rolleth hell&#x27;s fiery flood; With glad resolve to take the fatal leap, Though
danger threaten thee, to sink in endless sleep! Pure crystal goblet! forth I
draw thee now, From out thine antiquated case, where thou Forgotten hast
reposed for many a year! Oft at my father&#x27;s revels thou didst shine, To glad
the earnest guests was thine, As each to other passed the generous cheer. The
gorgeous brede of figures, quaintly wrought, Which he who quaff&#x27;d must first
in rhyme expound, Then drain the goblet at one draught profound, Hath nights
of boyhood to fond memory brought. I to my neighbour shall not reach thee
now, Nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show. Here is a juice, makes
drunk without delay; Its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill; Let this
last draught, the product of my skill, My own free choice, be quaff&#x27;d with
resolute will, A solemn festive greeting, to the coming day!
(He places the goblet to his mouth.)
(The ringing of bells, and choral voices.)
Chorus of Angels
Christ is arisen! Mortal, all hail to thee, Thou whom mortality, Earth&#x27;s sad
reality, Held as in prison.
Faust
What hum melodious, what clear silvery chime Thus draws the goblet from
my lips away? Ye deep - ton&#x27;d bells, do ye with voice sublime, Announce the
solemn dawn of Easter - day? Sweet choir! are ye the hymn of comfort
singing, Which one around the darkness of the grave, From seraph - voices,
in glad triumph ringing, Of a new covenant assurance gave?
Chorus of Women
We, his true - hearted, With spices and myrrh, Embalmed the departed, And
swathed him with care; Here we conveyed Him, Our Master, so dear; Alas!
Where we laid Him, The Christ is not here,
Chorus of Angels
Christ is arisen! Blessed the loving one, Who from earth&#x27;s trial throes, Healing
and strengthening woes, Soars as from prison.
Faust
Wherefore, ye tones celestial, sweet and strong, Come ye a dweller in the
dust to seek? Ring out your chimes believing crowds among, The message
well I hear, my faith alone is weak; From faith her darling, miracle, hath
sprung. Aloft to yonder spheres I dare not soar, Whence sound the tidings of
great joy; And yet, with this sweet strain familiar when a boy, Back it recalleth
me to life once more. Then would celestial love, with holy kiss, Come o&#x27;er me
in the Sabbath&#x27;s stilly hour, While, fraught with solemn meaning and
mysterious power, Chim&#x27;d the deep - sounding bell, and prayer was bliss; A
yearning impulse, undefin&#x27;d yet dear, Drove me to wander on through wood
and field; With heaving breast and many a burning tear, I felt with holy joy a
world reveal&#x27;d. Gay sports and festive hours proclaim&#x27;d with joyous pealing,
This Easter hymn in days of old; And fond remembrance now doth me, with
childlike feeling, Back from the last, the solemn step, withhold. O still sound
on, thou sweet celestial strain! The tear - drop flows, - Earth, I am thine
again!
Chorus of Disciples
He whom we mourned as dead, Living and glorious, From the dark grave
hath fled, O&#x27;er death victorious; Almost creative bliss Waits on his growing
powers; Ah! Him on earth we miss; Sorrow and grief are ours. Yearning he
left his own, Mid sore annoy; Ah! we must needs bemoan. Master, thy joy!
Chorus of Angels
Christ is arisen, Redeem&#x27;d from decay. The bonds which imprison Your souls,
rend away! Praising the Lord with zeal, By deeds that love reveal, Like
brethren true and leal Sharing the daily meal, To all that sorrow feel
Whisp&#x27;ring of heaven&#x27;s weal, Still is the master near, Still is he here!
Before The Gate
Promenaders of all sorts pass out.
Artisans
Why choose ye that direction, pray?
Others
To the hunting - lodge we&#x27;re on our way.
The First
We towards the mill are strolling on.
A Mechanic
A walk to Wasserhof were best.
A Second
The road is not a pleasant one.
The Others
What will you do?
A Third
I&#x27;ll join the rest.
A Fourth
Let&#x27;s up to Burghof, there you&#x27;ll find good cheer, The prettiest maidens and
the best of beer, And brawls of a prime sort.
A Fifth
You scapegrace! How; Your skin still itching for a row? Thither I will not go,
I loathe the place.
Servant Girl
No, no! I to the town my steps retrace.
Another
Near yonder poplars he is sure to be.
The First
And if he is, what matters it to me! With you he&#x27;ll walk, he&#x27;ll dance with none
but you, And with your pleasures what have I to do?
The Second
To - day he will not be alone, he said His friend would be with him, the curly -
head.
Student
Why how those buxom girls step on! Come, brother, we will follow them
anon. Strong beer, a damsel smartly dress&#x27;d, Stinging tobacco, - these I love
the best.
Burgher&#x27;s Daughter
Look at those handsome fellows there! &#x27;Tis really shameful, I declare, The
very best society they shun, After those servant girls forsooth, to run.
Second Student (to the first)
Not quite so fast! for in our rear, Two girls, well - dress&#x27;d, are drawing near;
Not far from us the one doth dwell, And sooth to say, I like her well. They
walk demurely, yet you&#x27;ll see, That they will let us join them presently.
The First
Not I! restraints of all kinds I detest. Quick! let us catch the wild - game ere it
flies, The hand on Saturday the mop that plies, Will on the Sunday fondle you
the best.
Burgher
No, this new Burgomaster, I like him not, God knows, Now, he&#x27;s in office,
daily more arrogant he grows; And for the town, what doth he do for it? Are
not things worse from day to day? To more restraints we must submit; And
taxes more than ever pay.
Beggar (sings)
Kind gentleman and ladies fair, So rosy - cheek&#x27;d and trimly dress&#x27;d, Be
pleas&#x27;d to listen to my prayer, Relieve and pity the distress&#x27;d. Let me not
vainly sing my lay! His heart&#x27;s most glad whose hand is free. Now when all
men keep holiday, Should be a harvest - day to me.
Another Burgher
On holidays and Sundays naught know I more inviting Than chatting about
war and war&#x27;s alarms, When folk in Turkey, up in arms, Far off, are &#x27;gainst
each other fighting. We at the window stand, our glasses drain, And watch
adown the stream the painted vessels gliding Then joyful we at eve come
home again, And peaceful times we bless, peace long - abiding.
Third Burgher
Ay, neighbour! So let matters stand for me! There they may scatter one
another&#x27;s brains, And wild confusion round them see So here at home in quiet
all remains! Old Woman (to the Burghers&#x27; Daughters) Heyday! How smart!
The fresh young blood! Who would not fall in love with you? Not quite so
proud! &#x27;Tis well and good! And what you wish, that I could help you to.
Burgher&#x27;s Daughter
Come, Agatha! I care not to be seen Walking in public with these witches.
True, My future lover, last St. Andrew&#x27;s E&#x27;en, In flesh and blood she brought
before my view.
Another
And mine she show&#x27;d me also in the glass, A soldier&#x27;s figure, with companions
bold; I look around, I seek him as I pass, In vain, his form I nowhere can
behold.
Soldiers
Fortress with turrets And walls high in air, Damsel disdainful, Haughty and
fair, There be my prey! Bold is the venture, Costly the pay!
Hark how the trumpet Thither doth call us, Where either pleasure Or death
may befall us. Hail to the tumult! Life&#x27;s in the field! Damsel and fortress To us
must yield.
Bold is the venture, Costly the pay! Gaily the soldier Marches away.
Faust and Wagner - Peasant Dances
Faust
Loosed from their fetters are streams and rills Through the gracious spring -
tide&#x27;s all - quickening glow; Hope&#x27;s budding joy in the vale doth blow; Old
Winter back to the savage hills Withdraweth his force, decrepid now. Thence
only impotent icy grains Scatters he as he wings his flight, Striping with sleet
the verdant plains; But the sun endureth no trace of white; Everywhere growth
and movement are rife, All things investing with hues of life: Though flowers
are lacking, varied of dye, Their colours the motley throng supply. Turn thee
around, and from this height, Back to the town direct thy sight. Forth from the
hollow, gloomy gate, Stream forth the masses, in bright array. Gladly seek
they the sun to - day; The Lord&#x27;s Resurrection they celebrate: For they
themselves have risen, with joy, From tenement sordid, from cheerless room,
From bonds of toil, from care and annoy, From gable and roof&#x27;s o&#x27;er -
hanging gloom, From crowded alley and narrow street, And from the
churches&#x27; awe - breathing night, All now have come forth into the light. Look,
only look, on nimble feet, Through garden and field how spread the throng,
How o&#x27;er the river&#x27;s ample sheet,
Many a gay wherry glides along; And see, deep sinking in the tide, Pushes the
last boat now away. E&#x27;en from yon far hill&#x27;s path - worn side, Flash the bright
hues of garments gay. Hark! Sounds of village mirth arise; This is the people&#x27;s
paradise. Both great and small send up a cheer; Here am I man, I feel it here.
Wagner
Sir Doctor, in a walk with you There&#x27;s honour and instruction too; Yet here
alone I care not to resort, Because I coarseness hate of every sort. This
fiddling, shouting, skittling, I detest; I hate the tumult of the vulgar throng; They
roar as by the evil one possess&#x27;d, And call it pleasure, call it song.
Peasants (under the linden - tree)
Dance and song
The shepherd for the dance was dress&#x27;d, With ribbon, wreath, and coloured
vest, A gallant show displaying. And round about the linden - tree, They
footed it right merrily. Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! So fiddle - bow
was braying
Our swain amidst the circle press&#x27;d, He push&#x27;d a maiden trimly dress&#x27;d, And
jogg&#x27;d her with his elbow; The buxom damsel turn&#x27;d her head, &quot;Now that&#x27;s a
stupid trick!&quot; she said Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Don&#x27;t be so
rude, good fellow!
Swift in the circle they advanced, They danced to right, to left they danced,
And all the skirts were swinging. And they grew red, and they grew warm,
Panting, they rested arm in arm, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! To
hip their elbow bringing.
Don&#x27;t make so free! How many a maid Has been betroth&#x27;d and then betray&#x27;d;
And has repented after! Yet still he flatter&#x27;d her aside, And from the linden, far
and wide, Juchhe! Juchhe! Juchheisa! Heisa! He! Rang fiddle - bow and
laughter.
Old Peasant
Doctor, &#x27;tis really kind of you, To condescend to come this way, A highly
learned man like you, To join our mirthful throng to - day. Our fairest cup I
offer you, which we with sparkling drink have crown&#x27;d, And pledging you, I
pray aloud, That every drop within its round, While it your present thirst
allays, May swell the number of your days.
Faust
I take the cup you kindly reach, Thanks and prosperity to each! (The crowd
gather round in a circle.)
Old Peasant
Ay, truly! &#x27;tis well done, that you Our festive meeting thus attend; You, who in
evil days of yore, So often show&#x27;d yourself our friend! Full many a one stands
living here, Who from the fever&#x27;s deadly blast, Your father rescu&#x27;d, when his
skill The fatal sickness stay&#x27;d at last. A young man then, each house you
sought, Where reign&#x27;d the mortal pestilence. Corpse after corpse was carried
forth, But still unscath&#x27;d you issued thence. Sore then your trials and severe;
The Helper yonder aids the helper here.
All
Heaven bless the trusty friend, and long To help the poor his life prolong!
Faust
To Him above in homage bend, Who prompts the helper and Who help doth
send. (He proceeds with Wagner.)
Wagner
What feelings, great man, must thy breast inspire, At homage paid thee by this
crowd! Thrice blest Who from the gifts by him possessed Such benefit can
draw! The sire Thee to his boy with reverence shows; They press around,
inquire, advance, Hush&#x27;d is the fiddle, check&#x27;d the dance. Where thou dost
pass they stand in rows, And each aloft his bonnet throws, But little fails and
they to thee, As though the Host came by, would bend the knee.
Faust
A few steps further, up to yonder stone! Here rest we from our walk. In times
long past, Absorb&#x27;d in thought, here oft I sat alone, And disciplin&#x27;d myself
with prayer and fast. Then rich in hope, with faith sincere, With sighs, and
hands in anguish press&#x27;d, The end of that sore plague, with many a tear, From
heaven&#x27;s dread Lord, I sought to wrest. The crowd&#x27;s applause assumes a
scornful tone. Oh, could&#x27;st thou in my inner being read, How little either sire
or son, Of such renown deserves the meed! My sire, of good repute, and
sombre mood, O&#x27;er nature&#x27;s powers and every mystic zone, With honest zeal,
but methods of his own, With toil fantastic loved to brood; His time in dark
alchemic cell, With brother adepts he would spend, And there antagonists
compel, Through numberless receipts to blend. A ruddy lion there, a suitor
bold, In tepid bath was with the lily wed. Thence both, while open flames
around them roll&#x27;d, Were tortur&#x27;d to another bridal bed. Was then the youthful
queen descried With varied colours in the flask; This was our medicine; the
patients died, &quot;Who were restored?&quot; none cared to ask. With our infernal
mixture thus, ere long, These hills and peaceful vales among, We rag&#x27;d more
fiercely than the pest; Myself the deadly poison did to thousands give; They
pined away, I yet must live, To hear the reckless murderers blest.
Wagner
Why let this thought your soul o&#x27;ercast? Can man do more than with nice skill,
With firm and conscientious will, Practise the art transmitted from the past? If
thou thy sire dost honour in thy youth, His lore thou gladly wilt receive; In
manhood, dost thou spread the bounds of truth, Then may thy son a higher
goal achieve.
Faust
How blest, in whom the fond desire From error&#x27;s sea to rise, hope still
renews! What a man knows not, that he doth require, And what he knoweth,
that he cannot use. But let not moody thoughts their shadow throw O&#x27;er the
calm beauty of this hour serene! In the rich sunset see how brightly glow Yon
cottage homes, girt round with verdant green! Slow sinks the orb, the day in
now no more; Yonder he hastens to diffuse new life. Oh for a pinion from the
earth to soar, And after, ever after him to strive! Then should I see the world
below, Bathed in the deathless evening - beams, The vales reposing, every
height a - glow, The silver brooklets meeting golden streams. The savage
mountain, with its cavern&#x27;d side, Bars not my godlike progress. Lo, the ocean,
Its warm bays heaving with a tranquil motion, To my rapt vision opes its
ample tide! But now at length the god appears to sink; A new - born impulse
wings my flight, Onward I press, his quenchless light to drink, The day before
me, and behind the night, The pathless waves beneath, and over me the skies.
Fair dream, it vanish&#x27;d with the parting day! Alas! that when on spirit - wing
we rise, No wing material lifts our mortal clay. But &#x27;tis our inborn impulse,
deep and strong, Upwards and onwards still to urge our flight, When far
above us pours its thrilling song The sky - lark, lost in azure light, When on
extended wing amain O&#x27;er pine - crown&#x27;d height the eagle soars, And over
moor and lake, the crane Still striveth towards its native shores.
Wagner
To strange conceits oft I myself must own, But impulse such as this I ne&#x27;er
have known: Nor woods, nor fields, can long our thoughts engage, Their
wings I envy not the feather&#x27;d kind; Far otherwise the pleasures of the mind,
Bear us from book to book, from page to page! Then winter nights grow
cheerful; keen delight Warms every limb; and ah! when we unroll Some old
and precious parchment, at the sight All heaven itself descends upon the soul.
Faust
Thy heart by one sole impulse is possess&#x27;d; Unconscious of the other still
remain! Two souls, alas! are lodg&#x27;d within my breast, Which struggle there for
undivided reign: One to the world, with obstinate desire, And closely -
cleaving organs, still adheres; Above the mist, the other doth aspire, With
sacred vehemence, to purer spheres. Oh, are there spirits in the air, Who float
&#x27;twixt heaven and earth dominion wielding, Stoop hither from your golden
atmosphere, Lead me to scenes, new life and fuller yielding! A magic mantle
did I but possess, Abroad to waft me as on viewless wings, I&#x27;d prize it far
beyond the costliest dress, Nor would I change it for the robe of kings.
Alas, two souls are living in my breast, And one wants to separate itself from
the other. One holds fast to the world with earthy passion And clings with
twining tendrils: The other lifts itself with forceful craving To the very roof of
heaven.
Wagner
Call not the spirits who on mischief wait! Their troop familiar, streaming
through the air, From every quarter threaten man&#x27;s estate, And danger in a
thousand forms prepare! They drive impetuous from the frozen north, With
fangs sharp - piercing, and keen arrowy tongues; From the ungenial east they
issue forth, And prey, with parching breath, upon thy lungs; If, waft&#x27;d on the
desert&#x27;s flaming wing, They from the south heap fire upon the brain,
Refreshment from the west at first they bring, Anon to drown thyself and field
and plain. In wait for mischief, they are prompt to hear; With guileful purpose
our behests obey; Like ministers of grace they oft appear, And lisp like
angels, to betray. But let us hence! Grey eve doth all things blend, The air
grows chill, the mists descend! &#x27;Tis in the evening first our home we prize Why
stand you thus, and gaze with wondering eyes? What in the gloom thus moves
you?
Faust
Yon black hound See&#x27;st thou, through corn and stubble scampering round?
Wagner
I&#x27;ve mark&#x27;d him long, naught strange in him I see!
Faust
Note him! What takest thou the brute to be?
Wagner
But for a poodle, whom his instinct serves His master&#x27;s track to find once
more.
Faust
Dost mark how round us, with wide spiral curves, He wheels, each circle
closer than before? And, if I err not, he appears to me A line of fire upon his
track to leave.
Wagner
Naught but a poodle black of hue I see; &#x27;Tis some illusion doth your sight
deceive.
Faust
Methinks a magic coil our feet around, He for a future snare doth lightly
spread.
Wagner
Around us as in doubt I see him shyly bound, Since he two strangers seeth in
his master&#x27;s stead.
Faust
The circle narrows, he&#x27;s already near!
Wagner
A dog dost see, no spectre have we here; He growls, doubts, lays him on his
belly, too, And wags his tail - as dogs are wont to do.
Faust
Come hither, Sirrah! join our company!
Wagner
A very poodle, he appears to be! Thou standest still, for thee he&#x27;ll wait; Thou
speak&#x27;st to him, he fawns upon thee straight; Aught thou mayst lose, again he&#x27;ll
bring, And for thy stick will into water spring.
Faust
Thou&#x27;rt right indeed; no traces now I see Whatever of a spirit&#x27;s agency. &#x27;Tis
training - nothing more.
Wagner
A dog well taught E&#x27;en by the wisest of us may be sought. Ay, to your favour
he&#x27;s entitled too, Apt scholar of the students, &#x27;tis his due! (They enter the gate
of the town.)
Faust Meets With Mephistopheles
Study
Faust (entering with the poodle)
Now field and meadow I&#x27;ve forsaken; O&#x27;er them deep night her veil doth
draw; In us the better soul doth waken, With feelings of foreboding awe, All
lawless promptings, deeds unholy, Now slumber, and all wild desires; The
love of man doth sway us wholly, And love to God the soul inspires.
Peace, poodle, peace! Scamper not thus; obey me! Why at the threshold
snuffest thou so? Behind the stove now quietly lay thee, My softest cushion to
thee I&#x27;ll throw. As thou, without, didst please and amuse me Running and
frisking about on the hill, So tendance now I will not refuse thee; A welcome
guest, if thou&#x27;lt be still.
Ah! when the friendly taper gloweth, Once more within our narrow cell, Then
in the heart itself that knoweth, A light the darkness doth dispel. Reason her
voice resumes; returneth Hope&#x27;s gracious bloom, with promise rife; For
streams of life the spirit yearneth, Ah! for the very fount of life.
Poodle, snarl not! with the tone that arises, Hallow&#x27;d and peaceful, my soul
within, Accords not thy growl, thy bestial din. We find it not strange, that man
despises What he conceives not; That he the good and fair misprizes Finding
them often beyond his ken; Will the dog snarl at them like men?
But ah! Despite my will, it stands confessed, Contentment welleth up no
longer in my breast. Yet wherefore must the stream, alas, so soon be dry,
That we once more athirst should lie? Full oft this sad experience hath been
mine; Nathless the want admits of compensation; For things above the earth
we learn to pine, Our spirits yearn for revelation, Which nowhere burns with
purer beauty blent, Than here in the New Testament. To ope the ancient text
an impulse strong Impels me, and its sacred lore, With honest purpose to
explore, And render into my love German tongue.
(He opens a volume, and applies himself to it.)
&#x27;Tis writ, &quot;In the beginning was the Word!&quot; I pause, perplex&#x27;d! Who now will
help afford? I cannot the mere Word so highly prize; I must translate it
otherwise, If by the spirit guided as I read. &quot;In the beginning was the Sense!&quot;
Take heed, The import of this primal sentence weigh, Lest thy too hasty pen
be led astray! Is force creative then of Sense the dower? &quot;In the beginning
was the Power!&quot; Thus should it stand: yet, while the line I trace, A something
warns me, once more to efface. The spirit aids! from anxious scruples freed, I
write, &quot;In the beginning was the Deed!&quot;
Am I with thee my room to share, Poodle, thy barking now forbear, Forbear
thy howling! Comrade so noisy, ever growling, I cannot suffer here to dwell.
One or the other, mark me well, Forthwith must leave the cell. I&#x27;m loath the
guest - right to withhold; The door&#x27;s ajar, the passage clear; But what must
now mine eyes behold! Are nature&#x27;s laws suspended here? Real is it, or a
phantom show? In length and breadth how doth my poodle grow! He lifts
himself with threat&#x27;ning mien, In likeness of a dog no longer seen! What
spectre have I harbour&#x27;d thus! Huge as a hippopotamus, With fiery eye,
terrific tooth! Ah! now I know thee, sure enough! For such a base, half -
hellish brood, The key of Solomon is good.
Spirits (without)
Captur&#x27;d there within is one! Stay without and follow none! Like a fox in iron
snare, Hell&#x27;s old lynx is quaking there,
But take heed! Hover round, above, below,
To and fro, Then from durance is he freed! Can ye aid him, spirits all, Leave
him not in mortal thrall! Many a time and oft hath he Served us, when at
liberty.
Faust
The monster to confront, at first, The spell of Four must be rehears&#x27;d;
Salamander shall kindle, Writhe nymph of the wave, In air sylph shall dwindle,
And Kobold shall slave.
Who doth ignore The primal Four, Nor knows aright Their use and might,
O&#x27;er spirits will he Ne&#x27;er master be!
Vanish in the fiery glow, Salamander! Rushingly together flow. Undine!
Shimmer in the meteor&#x27;s gleam, Sylphide! Hither bring thine homely aid,
Incubus! Incubus! Step forth! I do adjure thee thus! None of the Four Lurks
in the beast: He grins at me, untroubled as before; I have not hurt him in the
least. A spell of fear Thou now shalt hear. Art thou, comrade fell, Fugitive
from Hell? See then this sign, Before which incline The murky troops of Hell!
With bristling hair now doth the creature swell.
Canst thou, reprobate, Read the uncreate, Unspeakable, diffused Throughout
the heavenly sphere, Shamefully abused, Transpierced with nail and spear!
Behind the stove, tam&#x27;d by my spells, Like an elephant he swells; Wholly now
he fills the room, He into mist will melt away. Ascend not to the ceiling!
Come, Thyself at the master&#x27;s feet now lay! Thou seest that mine is no idle
threat. With holy fire I will scorch thee yet! Wait not the might That lies in the
triple - glowing light! Wait not the might Of all my arts in fullest measure!
Mephistopheles
(As the mist sinks, comes forward from behind the stove, in the dress of a
travelling scholar) Why all this uproar? What&#x27;s the master&#x27;s pleasure?
Faust
This then the kernel of the brute! A traveling scholar? Why I needs must
smile.
Mephistopheles
Your learned reverence humbly I salute! You&#x27;ve made me swelter in a pretty
style.
Faust
Thy name?
Mephistopheles
The question trifling seems from one, Who it appears the Word doth rate so
low; Who, undeluded by mere outward show, To Being&#x27;s depths would
penetrate alone.
Faust
With gentlemen like you indeed The inward essence from the name we read,
As all too plainly it doth appear, When Beelzebub, Destroyer, Liar, meets the
ear. Who then art thou?
Mephistopheles
Part of that power which still Produceth good, whilst ever scheming ill.
Faust
What hidden mystery in this riddle lies?
Mephistopheles
The spirit I, which evermore denies! And justly; for whate&#x27;er to light is brought
Deserves again to be reduced to naught; Then better &#x27;twere that naught should
be. Thus all the elements which ye Destruction, Sin, or briefly, Evil, name, As
my peculiar element I claim.
Faust
Thou nam&#x27;st thyself a part, and yet a whole I see.
Mephistopheles
The modest truth I speak to thee. Though folly&#x27;s microcosm, man, it seems,
Himself to be a perfect whole esteems: Part of the part am I, which at the first
was all, A part of darkness, which gave birth to light, Proud light, who now
his mother would enthrall, Contesting space and ancient rank with night. Yet
he succeedeth not, for struggle as he will, To forms material he adhereth still;
From them he streameth, them he maketh fair, And still the progress of his
beams they check; And so, I trust, when comes the final wreck, Light will, ere
long, the doom of matter share.
Faust
Thy worthy avocation now I guess! Wholesale annihilation won&#x27;t prevail, So
thou&#x27;rt beginning on a smaller scale.
Mephistopheles
And, to say truth, as yet with small success. Oppos&#x27;d to naught, this clumsy
world, The something - it subsisteth still; Not yet is it to ruin hurl&#x27;d, Despite
the efforts of my will. Tempests and earthquakes, fire and flood, I&#x27;ve tried;
Yet land and ocean still unchang&#x27;d abide! And then of humankind and beasts,
the accursed brood, Neither o&#x27;er them can I extend my sway. What countless
myriads have I swept away! Yet ever circulates the fresh young blood. It is
enough to drive me to despair! As in the earth, in water, and in air, A
thousand germs burst forth spontaneously; In moisture, drought, heat, cold,
they still appear! Had I not flame selected as my sphere Nothing apart had
been reversed for me.
Faust
So thou with thy cold devil&#x27;s fist Still clench&#x27;d in malice impotent Dost the
creative power resist, The active, the beneficent! Henceforth some other task
essay, Of Chaos thou the wondrous son!
Mephistopheles
We will consider what you say, And talk about it more anon! For this time
have I leave to go?
Faust
Why thou shouldst ask, I cannot see. Since thee I now have learned to know,
At thy good pleasure, visit me. Here is the window, here the door, The
chimney, too, may serve thy need.
Mephistopheles
I must confess, my stepping o&#x27;er Thy threshold a slight hindrance doth
impede; The wizard - foot doth me retain.
Faust
The pentagram thy peace doth mar? To me, thou son of hell, explain, How
camest thou in, if this thine exit bar? Could such a spirit aught ensnare?
Mephistopheles
Observe it well, it is not drawn with care, One of the angles, that which points
without, Is, as thou seest, not quite closed.
Faust
Chance hath the matter happily dispos&#x27;d! So thou my captive art? No doubt!
By accident thou thus art caught!
Mephistopheles
In sprang the dog, indeed, observing naught; Things now assume another
shape, The devil&#x27;s in the house and can&#x27;t escape.
Faust
Why through the window not withdraw?
Mephistopheles
For ghosts and for the devil &#x27;tis a law. Where they stole in, there they must
forth. We&#x27;re free The first to choose; as to the second, slaves are we.
Faust
E&#x27;en hell hath its peculiar laws, I see! I&#x27;m glad of that! a pact may then be
made, The which you gentlemen will surely keep?
Mephistopheles
What e&#x27;er therein is promised thou shalt reap, No tittle shall remain unpaid.
But such arrangements time require; We&#x27;ll speak of them when next we meet;
Most earnestly I now entreat, This once permission to retire.
Faust
Another moment prithee here remain, Me with some happy word to pleasure.
Mephistopheles
Now let me go! ere long I&#x27;ll come again, Then thou may&#x27;st question at thy
leisure.
Faust
&#x27;Twas not my purpose thee to lime; The snare hast entered of thine own free
will: Let him who holds the devil, hold him still! So soon he&#x27;ll catch him not a
second time.
Mephistopheles
If it so please thee, I&#x27;m at thy command; Only on this condition, understand;
That worthily thy leisure to beguile, I here may exercise my arts awhile.
Faust
Thou&#x27;rt free to do so! Gladly I&#x27;ll attend; But be thine art a pleasant one!
Mephistopheles
My friend,
This hour enjoyment more intense, Shall captivate each ravish&#x27;d sense, Than
thou could&#x27;st compass in the bound Of the whole year&#x27;s unvarying round; And
what the dainty spirits sing, The lovely images they bring. Are no fantastic
sorcery. Rich odours shall regale your smell, On choicest sweets your palate
dwell, Your feelings thrill with ecstasy. No preparation do we need, Here we
together are. Proceed.
Spirits
Hence overshadowing gloom, Vanish from sight! O&#x27;er us thine azure dome,
Bend, beauteous light! Dark clouds that o&#x27;er us spread, Melt in thin air! Stars,
your soft radiance shed, Tender and fair. Girt with celestial might, Winging
their airy flight, Spirits are thronging. Follows their forms of light Infinite
longing! Flutter their vestures bright O&#x27;er field and grove! Where in their leafy
bower Lovers the livelong hour Vow deathless love. Soft bloometh bud and
bower! Bloometh the grove! Grapes from the spreading vine Crown the full
measure; Fountains of foaming wine Gush from the pressure. Still where the
currents wind, Gems brightly gleam. Leaving the hills behind On rolls the
stream; Now into ample seas, Spreadeth the flood; Laving the sunny leas,
Mantled with wood. Rapture the feather&#x27;d throng, Gaily careering, Sip as they
float along; Sunward they&#x27;re steering; On towards the isles of light Winging
their way, That on the waters bright Dancingly play. Hark to the choral strain,
Joyfully ringing! While on the grassy plain Dancers are springing; Climbing the
steep hill&#x27;s side, Skimming the glassy tide, Wander they there; Others on
pinions wide Wing the blue air; All lifeward tending, upward still wending,
Towards yonder stars that gleam, Far, far above; Stars from whose tender
beam Rains blissful love.
Mephistopheles
Well done, my dainty spirits! now he slumbers! Ye have entranc&#x27;d him fairly
with your numbers! This minstrelsy of yours I must repay, Thou art not yet the
man to hold the devil fast! With fairest shapes your spells around him cast,
And plunge him in a sea of dreams! But that this charm be rent, the threshold
passed, Tooth of rat the way must clear. I need not conjure long it seems,
One rustles hitherward, and soon my voice will hear. The master of the rats
and mice, Of flies and frogs, of bugs and lice, Commands thy presence;
without fear Come forth and gnaw the threshold here, Where he with oil has
smear&#x27;d it. - Thou Com&#x27;st hopping forth already! Now To work! The point
that holds me bound Is in the outer angle found. Another bite - so - now &#x27;tis
doneNow, Faustus, till we meet again, dream on.
Faust (awaking)
Am I once more deluded! must I deem That thus the throng of spirits
disappear? The devil&#x27;s presence, was it but a dream? Hath but a poodle
scap&#x27;d and left me here?
Faust And Mephistopheles - A Student
Study
Faust
A knock? Come in! Who now would break my rest?
Mephistopheles
&#x27;Tis I!
Faust
Come in!
Mephistopheles
Thrice be the words express&#x27;d.
Faust
Then I repeat, Come in! Mephistopheles
&#x27;Tis well, I hope that we shall soon agree! For now your fancies to expel,
Here, as a youth of high degree, I come in gold - lac&#x27;d scarlet vest, And stiff -
silk mantle richly dress&#x27;d, A cock&#x27;s gay feather for a plume, A long and
pointed rapier, too; And briefly I would counsel you To don at once the same
costume, And, free from trammels, speed away, That what life is you may
essay.
Faust
In every garb I needs must feel oppress&#x27;d, My heart to earth&#x27;s low cares a
prey. Too old the trifler&#x27;s part to play, Too young to live by no desire
possess&#x27;d. What can the world to me afford? Renounce! renouce! is still the
word; This is the everlasting song In every ear that ceaseless rings, And
which, alas, our whole life long, Hoarsely each passing moment sings. But to
new horror I awake each morn, And I could weep hot tears, to see the sun
Dawn on another day, whose round forlorn Accomplishes no wish of mine -
not one. Which still, with froward captiousness, impains E&#x27;en the presentiment
of every joy, While low realities and paltry cares The spirit&#x27;s fond imaginings
destroy. Then must I too, when falls the veil of night, Stretch&#x27;d on my pallet
languish in despair, Appalling dreams my soul affright; No rest vouchsafed me
even there. The god, who throned within my breast resides, Deep in my soul
can stir the springs; With sovereign sway my energies he guides, He cannot
move external things; And so existence is to me a weight. Death fondly I
desire, and life I hate.
Mephistopheles
And yet, methinks, by most &#x27;twill be confess&#x27;d That Death is never quite a
welcome guest.
Faust
Happy the man around whose brow he binds The bloodstain&#x27;d wreath in
conquest&#x27;s dazzling hour; Or whom, excited by the dance, he finds Dissolv&#x27;d
in bliss, in love&#x27;s delicious bower! O that before the lofty spirit&#x27;s might,
Enraptured, I had rendered up my soul!
Mephistopheles
Yet did a certain man refrain one night, Of its brown juice to drain the crystal
bowl.
Faust
To play the spy diverts you then?
Mephistopheles
I own, Though not omniscient, much to me is known.
Faust
If o&#x27;er my soul the tone familiar, stealing, Drew me from harrowing thought&#x27;s
bewild&#x27;ring maze, Touching the ling&#x27;ring chords of childlike feeling, With sweet
harmonies of happier days: So curse I all, around the soul that windeth Its
magic and alluring spell, And with delusive flattery bindeth Its victim to this
dreary cell! Curs&#x27;d before all things be the high opinion, Wherewith the spirit
girds itself around! Of shows delusive curs&#x27;d be the dominion, Within whose
mocking sphere our sense is bound! Accurs&#x27;d of dreams the treacherous
wiles, The cheat of glory, deathless fame! Accurs&#x27;d what each as property
beguiles, Wife, child, slave, plough, whate&#x27;er its name! Accurs&#x27;d be mammon,
when with treasure He doth to daring deeds incite: Or when to steep the soul
in pleasure, He spreads the couch of soft delight! Curs&#x27;d be the grape&#x27;s
balsamic juice! Accurs&#x27;d love&#x27;s dream, of joys the first! Accurs&#x27;d be hope!
accurs&#x27;d be faith! And more than all, be patience curs&#x27;d!
Chorus of Spirits (invisible)
Woe! Woe! Thou hast destroy&#x27;d The beautiful world With violent blow; &#x27;Tis
shiver&#x27;d! &#x27;tis shatter&#x27;d! The fragments abroad by a demigod scatter&#x27;d! Now
we sweep The wrecks into nothingness! Fondly we weep The beauty that&#x27;s
gone! Thou, &#x27;mongst the sons of earth, Lofty and mighty one, Build it once
more! In thine own bosom the lost world restore! Now with unclouded sense
Enter a new career; Songs shall salute thine ear, Ne&#x27;er heard before!
Mephistopheles
My little ones these spirits be. Hark! with shrewd intelligence, How they
recommend to thee Action, and the joys of sense! In the busy world to dwell,
Fain they would allure thee hence: For within this lonely cell, Stagnate sap of
life and sense.
Forbear to trifle longer with thy grief, Which, vulture - like, consumes thee in
this den. The worst society is some relief, Making thee feel thyself a man with
men. Nathless, it is not meant, I trow, To thrust thee &#x27;mid the vulgar throng. I
to the upper ranks do not belong; Yet if, by me companion&#x27;d, thou Thy steps
through life forthwith wilt take, Upon the spot myself I&#x27;ll make Thy comrade;
Should it suit thy need, I am thy servant, am thy slave indeed!
Faust
And how must I thy services repay?
Mephistopheles
Thereto thou lengthen&#x27;d repite hast!
Faust
No! No! The devil is an egoist I know: And, for Heaven&#x27;s sake, &#x27;tis not his
way Kindness to any one to show. Let the condition plainly be exprest! Such
a domestic is a dangerous guest.
Mephistopheles
I&#x27;ll pledge myself to be thy servant here, Still at thy back alert and prompt to
be; But when together yonder we appear, Then shalt thou do the same for
me.
Faust
But small concern I feel for yonder world; Hast thou this system into ruin
hurl&#x27;d, Another may arise the void to fill. This earth the fountain whence my
pleasures flow, This sun doth daily shine upon my woe, And if this world I
must forego, Let happen then, - what can and will. I to this theme will close
mine ears, If men hereafter hate and love, And if there be in yonder spheres A
depth below or height above.
Mephistopheles
In this mood thou mayst venture it. But make The compact! I at once will
undertake To charm thee with mine arts. I&#x27;ll give thee more Than mortal eye
hath e&#x27;er beheld before.
Faust
What, sorry Devil, hast thou to bestow? Was ever mortal spirit, in its high
endeavour, Fathom&#x27;d by Being such as thou? Yet food thou hast which
satisfieth never, Hast ruddy gold, that still doth flow Like restless quicksilver
away, A game thou hast, at which none win who play, A girl who would, with
amorous eyen, E&#x27;en from my breast, a neighbour snare, Lofty ambition&#x27;s joy
divine, That, meteor - like, dissolves in air. Show me the fruit that, ere &#x27;tis
pluck&#x27;d, doth rot, And trees, whose verdure daily buds anew!
Mephistopheles
Such a commission scares me not, I can provide such treasures, it is true; But,
my good friend, a season will come round, When on what&#x27;s good we may
regale in peace.
Faust
If e&#x27;er upon my couch, stretched at my ease, I&#x27;m found, Then may my life that
instant cease! Me canst thou cheat with glozing wile Till self - reproach away I
cast, Me with joy&#x27;s lure canst thou beguile; Let that day be for me the last! Be
this our wager!
Mephistopheles
Settled!
Faust
Sure and fast! When to the moment I shall say, &quot;Linger awhile! so fair thou
art!&quot; Then mayst thou fetter me straightway, Then to the abyss will I depart!
Then may the solemn death - bell sound, Then from thy service thou art free,
The index then may cease its round. And time be never more for me!
Mephistopheles
I shall remember: pause, ere &#x27;tis too late.
Faust
Thereto a perfect right hast thou. My strength I do not rashly overrate. Slave
am I here, at any rate, If thine, or whose, it matters not, I trow.
Mephistopheles
At thine inaugural feast I will this day Attend, my duties to commence. But
one thing! - Accidents may happen, hence A line or two in writing grant, I
pray.
Faust
A writing, Pedant! dost demand from me? Man, and man&#x27;s plighted word, are
these unknown to thee? Is&#x27;t not enough, that by the word I gave, My doom
for evermore is cast? Doth not the world in all its currents rave, And must a
promise hold me fast? Yet fixed is this delusion in our heart; Who, of his own
free will, therefrom would part? How blest within whose breast truth reigneth
pure! No sacrifice will he repent when made! A formal deed, with seal and
signature, A spectre this from which all shrink afraid. The word its life
resigneth in the pen, Leather and wax usurp the mastery then. Spirits of evil!
what dost thou require? Brass, marble, parchment, paper, dost desire? Shall I
with chisel, pen, or graver write? Thy choice is free; to me &#x27;tis all the same.
Mephistopheles
Wherefore thy passion so excite And thus thine eloquence inflame? A scrap is
for our compact good. Thou under - signest merely with a drop of blood.
Faust
If this will satisfy thy mind, Thy whim I&#x27;ll gratify, howe&#x27;er absurd.
Mephistopheles
Blood is a juice of very special kind.
Faust
Be not afraid that I shall break my word! The scope of all my energy Is in
exact accordance with my vow. Vainly I have aspired too high; I&#x27;m on a level
but with such as thou; Me the great spirit scorn&#x27;d, defied; Nature from me
herself doth hide; Rent is the web of thought; my mind Doth knowledge loathe
of every kind. In depths of sensual pleasure drown&#x27;d, Let us our fiery passions
still! Enwrapp&#x27;d in magic&#x27;s veil profound, Let wondrous charms our senses
thrill! Plunge we in time&#x27;s tempestuous flow, Stem we the rolling surge of
chance! There may alternate weal and woe, Success and failure, as they can,
Mingle and shift in changeful dance! Excitement is the sphere for man.
Mephistopheles
Nor goal, nor measure is prescrib&#x27;d to you, If you desire to taste of every
thing, To snatch at joy while on the wing, May your career amuse and profit
too! Only fall to and don&#x27;t be over coy!
Faust
Hearken! The end I aim at is not joy; I crave excitement, agonizing bliss,
Enamour&#x27;d hatred, quickening vexation. Purg&#x27;d from the love of knowledge,
my vocation, The scope of all my powers henceforth be this, To bare my
breast to every pang, - to know In my heart&#x27;s core all human weal and woe,
To grasp in thought the lofty and the deep, Men&#x27;s various fortunes on my
breast to heap, And thus to theirs dilate my individual mind, And share at
length with them the shipwreck of mankind.
Mephistopheles
Oh, credit me, who still as ages roll, Have chew&#x27;d this bitter fare from year to
year, No mortal, from the cradle to the bier, Digests the ancient leaven!
Know, this Whole Doth for the Deity alone subsist! He in eternal brightness
doth exist, Us unto darkness he hath brought, and here Where day and night
alternate, is your sphere.
Faust
But &#x27;tis my will!
Mephistopheles
Well spoken, I admit! But one thing puzzles me, my friend; Time&#x27;s short, art
long; methinks &#x27;twere fit That you to friendly counsel should attend. A poet
choose as your ally! Let him thought&#x27;s wide dominion sweep, Each good and
noble quality, Upon your honoured brow to heap; The lion&#x27;s magnanimity,
The fleetness of the hind, The fiery blood of Italy, The Northern&#x27;s steadfast
mind. Let him to you the mystery show To blend high aims and cunning low;
And while youth&#x27;s passions are aflame To fall in love by rule and plan! I fain
would meet with such a man; Would him Sir Microcosmus name.
Faust
What then am I, if I aspire in vain The crown of our humanity to gain,
Towards which my every sense doth strain?
Mephistopheles
Thou&#x27;rt after all - just what thou art. Put on thy head a wig with countless
locks, And to a cubit&#x27;s height upraise thy socks, Still thou remainest ever,
what thou art.
Faust
I fell it, I have heap&#x27;d upon my brain The gather&#x27;d treasure of man&#x27;s thought in
vain; And when at length from studious toil I rest, No power, new - born,
springs up within my breast; A hair&#x27;s breadth is not added to my height, I am
no nearer to the infinite.
Mephistopheles
Good sir, these things you view indeed, Just as by other men they&#x27;re view&#x27;d;
We must more cleverly proceed, Before life&#x27;s joys our grasp elude. The devil!
thou hast hands and feet, And head and heart are also thine; What I enjoy
with relish sweet, Is it on that account less mine? If for six stallions I can pay,
Do I not own their strength and speed? A proper man I dash away, As their
two dozen legs were mine indeed. Up then, from idle pondering free, And
forth into the world with me! I tell you what; - your speculative churl Is like a
beast which some ill spirit leads, On barren wilderness, in ceaseless whirl,
While all around lie fair and verdant meads.
Faust
But how shall we begin?
Mephistopheles
We will go hence with speed, A place of torment this indeed! A precious life,
thyself to bore, And some few youngster evermore! Leave that to neighbour
Paunch! - withdraw, Why wilt thou plague thyself with thrashing straw? The
very best that thou dost know Thou dar&#x27;st not to the striplings show. One in
the passage now doth wait!
Faust
I&#x27;m in no mood to see him now.
Mephistopheles
Poor lad! He must be tired, I trow; He must not go disconsolate. Hand me
thy cap and gown; the mask Is for my purpose quite first rate. (He changes
his dress.) Now leave it to my wit! I ask But quarter of an hour; meanwhile
equip, And make all ready for our pleasant trip!
(Exit Faust.)
Mephistopheles And A Student
Mephistopheles (in Faust&#x27;s long gown)
Mortal! the loftiest attributes of men, Reason and Knowledge, only thus
contemn, Still let the Prince of lies, without control, With shows, and mocking
charms delude thy soul, I have thee unconditionally then! Fate hath endow&#x27;d
him with an ardent mind, Which unrestrain&#x27;d still presses on for ever, And
whose precipitate endeavour Earth&#x27;s joys o&#x27;erleaping, leaveth them behind.
Him will I drag through life&#x27;s wild waste, Through scenes of vapid dulness,
where at last Bewilder&#x27;d, he shall falter, and stick fast; And, still to mock his
greedy haste, Viands and drink shall float his craving lips beyond Vainly he&#x27;ll
seek refreshment, anguish - tost, And were he not the devil&#x27;s by his bond, Yet
must his soul infallibly be lost!
A Student enters
Student
But recently I&#x27;ve quitted home, Full of devotion am I come A man to know
and hear, whose name With reverence is known to fame.
Mephistopheles
Your courtesy much flatters me! A man like other men you see; Pray have
you yet applied elsewhere?
Student
I would entreat your friendly care! I&#x27;ve youthful blood and courage high; Of
gold I bring a fair supply; To let me go my mother was not fain; But here I
longed true knowledge to attain.
Mephistopheles
You&#x27;ve hit upon the very place.
Student
And yet my steps I would retrace. These walls, this melancholy room,
O&#x27;erpower me with a sense of gloom; The space is narrow, nothing green, No
friendly tree is to be seen: And in these halls, with benches filled, distraught,
Sight, hearing fail me, and the power of thought.
Mephistopheles
It all depends on habit. Thus at first The infant takes not kindly to the breast,
But before long, its eager thirst Is fain to slake with hearty zest: Thus at the
breasts of wisdom day by day With keener relish you&#x27;ll your thirst allay.
Student
Upon her neck I fain would hang with joy; To reach it, say, what means must
I employ?
Mephistopheles
Explain, ere further time we lose, What special faculty you choose?
Student
Profoundly learned I would grow, What heaven contains would comprehend,
O&#x27;er earth&#x27;s wide realm my gaze extend, Nature and science I desire to know.
Mephistopheles
Your are upon the proper track, I find; Take heed, let nothing dissipate your
mind.
Student
My heart and soul are in the chase! Though to be sure I fain would seize, On
pleasant summer holidays, A little liberty and careless ease.
Mephistopheles
Use well your time, so rapidly it flies; Method will teach you time to win;
Hence, my young friend, I would advise, With college logic to begin! Then
will your mind be so well braced, In Spanish boots so tightly laced, That on
&#x27;twill circumspectly creep, Thought&#x27;s beaten track securely keep, Nor will it,
ignis - fatuus like, Into the path of error strike. Then many a day they&#x27;ll teach
you how The mind&#x27;s spontaneous acts, till now As eating and as drinking free,
Require a process; - one! two! three! In truth the subtle web of thought Is like
the weaver&#x27;s fabric wrought: One treadle moves a thousand lines, Swift dart
the shuttles to and fro, Unseen the threads together flow, A thousand knots
one stroke combines. Then forward steps your sage to show, And prove to
you, it must be so; The first being so, and so the second, The third and fourth
deduc&#x27;d we see; And if there were no first and second, Nor third nor fourth
would ever be. This, scholars of all countries prize, Yet &#x27;mong themselves no
weavers rise. He who would know and treat of aught alive, Seeks first the
living spirit thence to drive: Then are the lifeless fragments in his hand, There
only fails, alas! the spirit - band. This process, chemists name, in learned
thesis, Mocking themselves, Naturae encheiresis.
Student
Your words I cannot full comprehend.
Mephistopheles
In a short time you will improve, my friend, When of scholastic forms you
learn the use; And how by method all things to reduce.
Student
So doth all this my brain confound, As if a mill - wheel there were turning
round.
Mephistopheles
And next, before aught else you learn, You must with zeal to metaphysics
turn! There see that you profoundly comprehend, What doth the limit of man&#x27;s
brain transcend; For that which is or is not in the head A sounding phrase will
serve you in good stead. But before all strive this half year From one fix&#x27;d
order ne&#x27;er to swerve! Five lectures daily you must hear; The hour still
punctually observe! Yourself with studious zeal prepare, And closely in your
manual look, Hereby may you be quite aware That all he utters standeth in the
book; Yet write away without cessation, As at the Holy Ghost&#x27;s dictation!
Student
This, Sir, a second time you need not say! Your counsel I appreciate quite;
What we possess in black and white, We can in peace and comfort bear
away.
Mephistopheles
A faculty I pray you name.
Student
For jurisprudence, some distaste I own.
Mephistopheles
To me this branch of science is well known, And hence I cannot your
repugnance blame. Customs and laws in every place, Like a disease, an heir -
loom dread, Still trail their curse from race to race, And furtively abroad they
spread. To nonsense, reason&#x27;s self they turn; Beneficence becomes a pest;
Woe unto thee, that thou&#x27;rt a grandson born! As for the law born with us,
unexpressed; That law, alas, none careth to discern.
Student
You deepen my dislike. The youth Whom you instruct, is blest in sooth! To
try theology I feel inclined.
Mephistopheles
I would not lead you willingly astray, But as regards this science, you will find
So hard it is to shun the erring way, And so much hidden poison lies therein,
Which scarce can you discern from medicine. Here too it is the best, to listen
but to one, And by the master&#x27;s words to swear alone. To sum up all - To
words hold fast! Then the safe gate securely pass&#x27;d, You&#x27;ll reach the fane of
certainty at last.
Student
But then some meaning must the words convey.
Mephistopheles
Right! But o&#x27;er - anxious thought, you&#x27;ll find of no avail, For there precisely
where ideas fail, A word comes opportunely into play Most admirable
weapons words are found, On words a system we securely ground, In words
we can conveniently believe, Nor of a single jot can we a word bereave.
Student
Your pardon for my importunity; Yet once more must I trouble you: On
medicine, I&#x27;ll thank you to supply A pregnant utterance or two! Three years!
how brief the appointed tide! The field, heaven knows, is all too wide! If but a
friendly hint be thrown, &#x27;Tis easier then to feel one&#x27;s way.
Mephistopheles (aside)
I&#x27;m weary of the dry pedantic tone, And must again the genuine devil play.
(Aloud)
Of medicine the spirit&#x27;s caught with ease, The great and little world you study
through, That things may then their course pursue, As heaven may please. In
vain abroad you range through science&#x27; ample space, Each man learns only
that which learn he can; Who knows the moment to embrace, He is your
proper man. In person you are tolerably made, Nor in assurance will you be
deficient: Self - confidence acquire, be not afraid, Others will then esteem you
a proficient. Learn chiefly with the sex to deal! Their thousands ahs and ohs,
These the sage doctor knows, He only from one point can heal. Assume a
decent tone of courteous ease, You have them then to humour as you please.
First a diploma must belief infuse, That you in your profession take the lead:
You then at once those easy freedoms use For which another many a year
must plead; Learn how to feel with nice address The dainty wrist; - and how
to press, With ardent furtive glance, the slender waist, To feel how tightly it is
laced.
Student
There is some sense in that! one sees the how and why.
Mephistopheles
Grey is, young friend, all theory: And green of life the golden tree.
Student
I swear it seemeth like a dream to me. May I some future time repeat my visit,
To hear on what your wisdom grounds your views?
Mephistopheles
Command my humble service when you choose.
Student
Ere I retire, one boon I must solicit: Here is my album, do not, Sir, deny This
token of your favour!
Mephistopheles
Willingly!
(He writes and returns the book.)
Student (reads)
Eritis Sicut Deus, Scientes Bonum Et Malum (He reverently closes the book
and retires.)
Mephistopheles
Let but this ancient proverb be your rule, My cousin follow still, the wily
snake, And with your likeness to the gods, poor fool, Ere long be sure your
poor sick heart will quake!
Faust (enters)
Whither away?
Mephistopheles
&quot;Tis thine our course to steer. The little world, and then the great we&#x27;ll view.
With what delight, what profit too, Thou&#x27;lt revel through thy gay career!
Faust
Despite my length of beard I need The easy manners that insure success; Th&#x27;
attempt I fear can ne&#x27;er succeed; To mingle in the world I want address; I still
have an embarrass&#x27;d air, and then I feel myself so small with other men.
Mephistopheles
Time, my good friend, will all that&#x27;s needful give; Be only self - possessed, and
thou hast learn&#x27;d to live.
Faust
But how are we to start, I pray? Steeds, servants, carriage, where are they?
Mephistopheles
We&#x27;ve but to spread this mantle wide, &#x27;Twill serve whereon through air to
ride, No heavy baggage need you take, When we our bold excursion make,
A little gas, which I will soon prepare, Lifts us from earth; aloft through air,
Light laden we shall swiftly steer; I wish you joy of your new life - career.
Auerbach&#x27;s Cellar In Leipzig
A Drinking Party
Frosch
No drinking? Naught a laugh to raise? None of your gloomy looks, I pray!
You, who so bright were wont to blaze, Are dull as wetted straw to - day.
Brander
&#x27;Tis all your fault; your part you do not bear, No beastliness, no folly.
Frosch
(pours a glass of wine over his head)
There, You have them both!
Brander
You double beast!
Frosch
&#x27;Tis what you ask&#x27;d me for, at least!
Siebel
Whoever quarrels, turn him out! With open throat drink, roar, and shout.
Hollo! Hollo! Ho!
Altmayer
Zounds, fellow, cease your deaf&#x27;ning cheers! Bring cotton - wool! He splits
my ears.
Siebel
&#x27;Tis when the roof rings back the tone, Then first the full power of the bass is
known.
Frosch
Right! out with him who takes offence! A! tara lara da!
Altmayer
A! tara lara da!
Frosch
Our throats are tuned. Come let&#x27;s commence!
(Sings)
The holy Roman empire now, How holds it still together?
Brander
An ugly song! a song political! A song offensive! Thank God, every morn To
rule the Roman empire, that you were not born! I bless my stars at least that
mine is not Either a kaiser&#x27;s or a chancellor&#x27;s lot. Yet &#x27;mong ourselves should
one still lord it o&#x27;er the rest; That we elect a pope I now suggest. Ye know,
what quality ensures A man&#x27;s success, his rise secures.
Frosch (sings)
Bear, lady nightingale above, Ten thousand greetings to my love.
Siebel
No greetings to a sweetheart! No love - songs shall there be!
Frosch
Love - greetings and love kisses! Thou shalt not hinder me!
(Sings)
Undo the bolt! in silly night, Undo the bolt! the lover wakes. Shut to the bolt!
when morning breaks.
Siebel
Ay, sing, sing on, praise her with all thy might! My turn to laugh will come
some day. Me hath she jilted once, you the same trick she&#x27;ll play. Some
gnome her lover be! where cross - roads meet,
With her to play the fool; or old he - goat, From Blocksberg coming in swift
gallop, bleat A good night to her, from his hairy throat! A proper lad of
genuine flesh and blood, Is for the damsel far too good; The greeting she shall
have from me, To smash her window - panes will be!
Brander (striking on the table)
Silence! Attend! to me give ear! Confess, sirs, I know how to live: Some love</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sick folk are sitting here! Hence, &#x27;tis but fit, their hearts to cheer, That I a
good - night strain to them should give. Hark! of the newest fashion is my
song! Strike boldly in the chorus, clear and strong!
(He sings)
Once in a cellar lived a rat, He feasted there on butter, Until his paunch
became as fat As that of Doctor Luther. The cook laid poison for the guest,
Then was his heart with pangs oppress&#x27;d, As if his frame love wasted.
Chorus (shouting)
As if his frame love wasted.
Brander
He ran around, he ran abroad, Of every puddle drinking. The house with rage
he scratch&#x27;d and gnaw&#x27;d, In vain, - he fast was sinking; Full many an anguish&#x27;d
bound he gave, Nothing the hapless brute could save, As if his frame love
wasted.
Chorus
As if his frame love wasted.
Brander
By torture driven, in open day, The kitchen he invaded, Convulsed upon the
hearth he lay, With anguish sorely jaded; The poisoner laugh&#x27;d, Ha! ha! quoth
she, His life is ebbing fast, I see, As if his frame love wasted.
Chorus
As if his frame love wasted.
Siebel
How the dull boors exulting shout! Poison for the poor rats to strew A fine
exploit it is no doubt.
Brander
They, as it seems, stand well with you!
Altmayer
Old bald - pate! with the paunch profound! The rat&#x27;s mishap hath tamed his
nature; For he his counterpart hath found Depicted in the swollen creature.
Auerbach&#x27;s Cellar - Faust And Mephistopheles Enter
Faust And Mephistopheles
Mephistopheles
I now must introduce to you Before aught else, this jovial crew, To show how
lightly life may glide away; With tse folk here each day&#x27;s a holiday. With little
wit and much content, Each on his own small round intent, Like sportive kitten
with its tail; While no sick - headache they bewail, And while their host will
credit give, Joyous and free from care they live.
Brander
They&#x27;re off a journey, that is clear, From their strange manners; they have
scarce been here An hour.
Frosch
You&#x27;re right! Leipzig&#x27;s the place for me! &#x27;Tis quite a little Paris; people there
Acquire a certain easy finish&#x27;d air.
Siebel
What take you now these travellers to be?
Frosch
Let me alone! O&#x27;er a full glass you&#x27;ll see, As easily I&#x27;ll worm their secret out,
As draw an infant&#x27;s tooth. I&#x27;ve not a doubt That my two gentlemen are nobly
born, They look dissatisfied and full of scorn.
Brander
They are but mountebanks, I&#x27;ll lay a bet!
Altmayer
Most like.
Frosch
Mark me, I&#x27;ll screw it from them yet!
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
These fellows would not scent the devil out, E&#x27;en though he had them by the
very throat!
Faust
Good - morrow, gentlemen!
Siebel
Thanks for your fair salute.
(Aside, glancing at Mephistopheles,)
How! goes the fellow on a halting foot?
Mephistopheles
Is it permitted here with you to sit? Then though good wine is not forthcoming
here, Good company at least our hearts will cheer.
Altmayer
A dainty gentleman, no doubt of it.
Frosch
You&#x27;re doubtless recently from Rippach? Pray, Did you with Master Hans
there chance to sup?
Mephistopheles
To - day we pass&#x27;d him, but we did not stop! When last we met him he had
much to say Touching his cousins, and to each he sent Full many a greeting
and kind compliment. (With an inclination towards Frosch.)
Altmayer (aside to Frosch)
You have it there!
Siebel
Faith! he&#x27;s a knowing one!
Frosch
Have patience! I will show him up anon!
Mephistopheles
We heard erewhile, unless I&#x27;m wrong, Voices well trained in chorus pealing?
Certes, most choicely here must song Re - echo from this vaulted ceiling!
Frosch
That you&#x27;re an amateur one plainly sees!
Mephistopheles
Oh no, though strong the love, I cannot boast much skill.
Altmayer
Give us a song!
Mephistopheles
As many as you will.
Siebel
But be it a brand new one, if you please!
Mephistopheles
But recently returned from Spain are we, The pleasant land of wine and
minstrelsy.
(Sings)
A king there was once reigning, Who had a goodly flea
Frosch
Hark! did you rightly catch the words? a flea! An odd sort of a guest he
needs must be.
Mephistopheles (sings)
A king there was once reigning, Who had a goodly flea, Him loved he without
feigning, As his own son were he! His tailor then he summon&#x27;d, The tailor to
him goes: Now measure me the youngster For jerkin and for hose!
Brander
Take proper heed, the tailor strictly charge, The nicest measurement to take,
And as he loves his head, to make The hose quite smooth and not too large!
Mephistopheles
In satin and in velvet, Behold the yonker dressed; Bedizen&#x27;d o&#x27;er with ribbons,
A cross upon his breast. Prime minister they made him, He wore a star of
state; And all his poor relations Were courtiers, rich and great.
The gentlemen and ladies At court were sore distressed; The queen and all
her maidens Were bitten by the pest, And yet they dared not scratch them,
Or chase the fleas away. If we are bit, we catch them, And crack without
delay.
Chorus (shouting)
If we are bit, &amp;c.
Frosch
Bravo! That&#x27;s the song for me!
Siebel
Such be the fate of every flea!
Brander
With clever finger catch and kill!
Altmayer
Hurrah for wine and freedom still!
Mephistopheles
Were but your wine a trifle better, friend, A glass to freedom I would gladly
drain,
Siebel
You&#x27;d better not repeat those words again!
Mephistopheles
I am afraid the landlord to offend; Else freely I would treat each worthy guest
From our own cellar to the very best.
Siebel
Out with it then! Your doings I&#x27;ll defend.
Frosch
Give a good glass, and straight we&#x27;ll praise you, one and all. Only let not your
samples be too small; For if my judgment you desire, Certes, an ample
mouthful I require.
Altmayer (aside)
I guess they&#x27;re from the Rhenish land.
Mephistopheles
Fetch me a gimlet here!
Brander
Say, what therewith to bore? You cannot have the wine - casks at the door?
Altmayer
Our landlord&#x27;s tool - basket behind doth yonder stand.
Mephistopheles (takes the gimlet)
(To Frosch)
Now only say! what liquor will you take?
Frosch
How mean you that? have you of every sort?
Mephistopheles
Each may his own selection make.
Altmayer (to Frosch)
Ha! Ha! You lick your lips already at the thought.
Frosch
Good, If I have my choice, the Rhenish I propose; For still the fairest gifts the
fatherland bestows.
Mephistopheles
(boring a hole in the edge of the table opposite to where Frosch is sitting)
Give me a little wax - and make some stoppers - quick!
Altmayer
Why, this is nothing but a juggler&#x27;s trick!
Mephistopheles (to Brander)
And you?
Brander
Champagne&#x27;s the wine for me; Right brisk, and sparkling let it be!
(Mephistopheles bores; one of the party has in the meantime prepared the
wax - stoppers and stopped the holes.)
Brander
What foreign is one always can&#x27;t decline, What&#x27;s good is often scatter&#x27;d far
apart. The French your genuine German hates with all his heart, Yet has a
relish for their wine.
Siebel
(as Mephistopheles approaches him)
I like not acid wine, I must allow, Give ma a glass of genuine sweet!
Mephistopheles (bores)
Tokay
Shall, if you wish it, flow without delay.
Altmayer
Come! look me in the face! no fooling now! You are but making fun of us, I
trow.
Mephistopheles
Ah! ah! that would indeed be making free With such distinguished guests.
Come, no delay; What liquor can I serve you with, I pray?
Altmayer
Only be quick, it matters not to me. (After the holes are bored and stopped.)
Mephistopheles (with strange gestures)
Grapes the vine - stock bears, Horns the buck - goat wears! Wine is sap, the
vine is wood, The wooden board yields wine as good. With a deeper glance
and true The mysteries of nature view! Have faith and here&#x27;s a miracle! Your
stoppers draw and drink your fill!
Flowing Wines - Visionary Scenes
All
(as they draw the stoppers and the wine chosen by each runs into his glass)
Oh beauteous spring, which flows so far!
Mephistopheles
Spill not a single drop, of this beware!
(They drink repeatedly.)
All (sing)
Happy as cannibals are we, Or as five hundred swine.
Mephistopheles
They&#x27;re in their glory, mark their elevation!
Faust
Let&#x27;s hence, nor here our stay prolong.
Mephistopheles
Attend, of brutishness ere long You&#x27;ll see a glorious revelation.
Siebel
(drinks carelessly; the wine is spilt upon the ground, and turns to flame)
Help! fire! help! Hell is burning!
Mephistopheles
(addressing the flames)
Stop, Kind element, be still, I say!
(To the Company.)
Of purgatorial fire as yet &#x27;tis but a drop.
Siebel
What means the knave! For this you&#x27;ll dearly pay! Us, it appears, you do not
know.
Frosch
Such tricks a second time he&#x27;d better show!
Altmayer
Methinks&#x27;twere well we pack&#x27;d him quietly away.
Siebel
What, sir! with us your hocus - pocus play!
Mephistopheles
Silence, old wine - cask!
Siebel
How! add insult, too! Vile broomstick!
Brander
Hold, or blows shall rain on you!
Altmayer
(draws a stopper out of the table; fire springs out against him)
I burn! I burn!
Siebel
&#x27;Tis sorcery, I vow! Strike home! The fellow is fair game, I trow!
(They draw their knives and attack Mephistopheles.)
Mephistopheles (with solemn gestures)
Visionary scenes appear! Words delusive cheat the ear! Be ye there, and be
ye here!
(They stand amazed and gaze at each other.)
Altmayer
Where am I? What a beauteous land!
Frosch
Vineyards! unless my sight deceives?
Siebel
And clust&#x27;ring grapes too, close at hand!
Brander
And underneath the spreading leaves, What stems there be! What grapes I
see!
(He seizes Siebel by the nose. The others reciprocally do the same, and raise
their knives.)
Mephistopheles (as above)
Delusion, from their eyes the bandage take! Note how the devil loves a jest to
break!
(He disappears with Faust; the fellows draw back from one another.)
Siebel
What was it?
Altmayer
How?
Frosch
Was that your nose?
Brander (to Siebel)
And look, my hand doth thine enclose!
Altmayer
I felt a shock, it went through every limb! A chair! I&#x27;m fainting! All things
swim!
Frosch
Say what has happened, what&#x27;s it all about?
Siebel
Where is the fellow? Could I scent him out, His body from his soul I&#x27;d soon
divide!
Altmayer
With my own eyes, upon a cask astride, Forth through the cellar - door I saw
him ride Heavy as lead my feet are growing.
(Turning to the table.)
I wonder is the wine still flowing!
Siebel
&#x27;Twas all delusion, cheat and lie.
Frosch
&#x27;Twas wine I drank, most certainly.
Brander
But with the grapes how was it, pray?
Altmayer
That none may miracles believe, who now will say?
The Witch&#x27;s Kitchen - Faust, Mephistopheles And The Monkies
A large caldron hangs over the fire on a low hearth; various figures appear in
the vapour rising from it. A Female Monkey sits beside the caldron to skim it,
and watch that it does not boil over. The Male Monkey with the young ones
is seated near, warming himself. The walls and ceiling are adorned with the
strangest articles of witch - furniture.
Faust, Mephistopheles
Faust
This senseless, juggling witchcraft I detest! Dost promise that in this foul nest
Of madness, I shall be restored? Must I seek counsel from an ancient dame?
And can she, by these rites abhorred, Take thirty winters from my frame?
Woe&#x27;s me, if thou naught better canst suggest! Hope has already fled my
breast. Has neither nature nor a noble mind A balsam yet devis&#x27;d of any kind?
Mephistopheles
My friend, you now speak sensibly. In truth, Nature a method giveth to renew
thy youth: But in another book the lesson&#x27;s writ; It forms a curious chapter, I
admit.
Faust
I fain would know it.
Mephistopheles
Good! A remedy Without physician, gold, or sorcery: Away forthwith, and to
the fields repair, Begin to delve, to cultivate the ground, Thy senses and
thyself confine Within the very narrowest round, Support thyself upon the
simplest fare, Live like a very brute the brutes among, Neither esteem it
robbery The acre thou dost reap, thyself to dung; This is the best method,
credit me, Again at eighty to grow hale and young.
Faust
I am not used to it, nor can myself degrade So far, as in my hand to take the
spade. This narrow life would suit me not at all.
Mephistopheles
Then we the witch must summon after all.
Faust
Will none but this old beldame do? Canst not thyself the potion brew?
Mephistopheles
A pretty play our leisure to beguile! A thousand bridges I could build
meanwhile. Not science only and consummate art, Patience must also bear
her part. A quiet spirit worketh whole years long; Time only makes the subtle
ferment strong. And all things that belong thereto, Are wondrous and
exceeding rare! The devil taught her, it is true; But yet the draught the devil
can&#x27;t prepare.
(Perceiving the beasts.)
Look yonder, what a dainty pair! Here is the maid! the knave is there!
(To the beasts)
It seems your dame is not a home?
The Monkeys
Gone to carouse, Out of the house, Thro&#x27; the chimney and away!
Mephistopheles
How long is it her wont to roam?
The Monkeys
While we can warm our paws she&#x27;ll stay.
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
What think you of the charming creatures?
Faust
I loathe alike their form and features!
Mephistopheles
Nay, such discourse, be it confessed, Is just the thing that pleases me the
best.
(To the Monkeys)
Tell me, ye whelps, accursed crew! What stir ye in the broth about?
Monkeys
Coarse beggar&#x27;s gruel here we stew.
Mephistopheles
Of customers you&#x27;ll have a rout.
The He - Monkey (approaching and fawning on Mephistopheles)
Quick! quick! throw the dice, Make me rich in a trice, Oh give me the prize!
Alas, for myself! Had I plenty of pelf, I then should be wise.
Mephistopheles
How blest the ape would think himself, if he Could only put into the lottery!
(In the meantime the young Monkeys have been playing with a large globe,
which they roll forwards)
The He - Monkey
The world behold; Unceasingly roll&#x27;d, It riseth and falleth ever; It ringeth like
glass! How brittle, alas! &#x27;Tis hollow, and resteth never. How bright the sphere,
Still brighter here! Now living am I! Dear son, beware! Nor venture there!
Thou too must die! It is of clay; &#x27;Twill crumble away; There fragments lie.
Mephistopheles
Of what use is the sieve?
The He - Monkey (taking it down)
(He runs to the She - Monkey, and makes her look through it.)
Look through the sieve! Dost know him the thief, And dar&#x27;st thou not call him
so?
Mephistopheles (approaching the fire)
And then this pot?
The Monkeys
The half - witted sot! He knows not the pot! He know not the kettle!
Mephistopheles
Unmannerly beast! Be civil at least!
The He - Monkey
Take the whisk and sit down in the settle!
(He makes Mephistopheles sit down.)
Faust
(who all this time has been standing before a looking - glass, now
approaching, and now retiring from it)
What do I see? what form, whose charms transcend The loveliness of earth,
is mirror&#x27;d here! O Love, to waft me to her sphere, To me the swiftest of thy
pinions lend! Alas! If I remain not rooted to this place, If to approach more
near I&#x27;m fondly lur&#x27;d, Her image fades, in veiling mist obscur&#x27;d! Model of
beauty both in form and face! Is&#x27;t possible? Hath woman charms so rare? In
this recumbent form, supremely fair, The essence must I see of heavenly
grace? Can aught so exquisite on earth be found?
Mephistopheles
The six days&#x27; labour of a god, my friend, Who doth himself cry bravo, at the
end, By something clever doubtless should be crown&#x27;d. For this time gaze
your fill, and when you please Just such a prize for you I can provide; How
blest is he to whom kind fate decrees, To take her to his home, a lovely bride!
(Faust continues to gaze into the mirror. Mephistopheles stretching himself on
the settle and playing with the whisk, continues to speak.)
Here sit I, like a king upon his throne; My sceptre this; - the crown I want
alone.
The Monkeys
(who have hitherto been making all sorts of strange gestures, bring
Mephistopheles a crown, with loud cries)
Oh, be so good, With sweat and with blood The crown to lime!
(They handle the crown awkwardly and break it in two pieces, with which
they skip about.)
&#x27;Twas fate&#x27;s decree! We speak and see! We hear and rhyme.
Faust (before the mirror)
Woe&#x27;s me! well - nigh distraught I feel!
Mephistopheles
(pointing to the beasts)
And even my own head almost begins to reel.
The Monkeys
If good luck attend, If fitly things blend, Our jargon with thought And with
reason is fraught!
Faust (as above)
A flame is kindled in my breast! Let us begone! nor linger here!
Mephistopheles
(in the same position)
It now at least must be confessed, That poets sometimes are sincere.
(The caldron which the She - Monkey has neglected begins to boil over; a
great flame arises, which streams up the chimney. The Witch comes down the
chimney with horrible cries.)
The Witch Returns
The Witch
Ough! ough! ough! ough! Accursed brute! accursed sow! The caldron dost
neglect, for shame! Accursed brute to scorch the dame!
(Perceiving Faust and Mephistopheles)
Whom have we here? Who&#x27;s sneaking here? Whence are ye come? With
what desire? The plague of fire Your bones consume!
(She dips the skimming - ladle into the caldron and throws flames at Faust,
Mephistopheles, and the Monkeys. The Monkeys whimper.)
Mephistopheles
(twirling the whisk which he holds in his hand, and striking among the glasses
and pots)
Dash! Smash! There lies the glass! There lies the slime! &#x27;Tis but a jest; I but
keep time, Thou hellish pest, To thine own chime!
(While the Witch steps back in rage and astonishment.)
Dost know me! Skeleton! Vile scarecrow, thou! Thy lord and master dost
thou know? What holds me, that I deal not now Thee and thine apes a
stunning blow? No more respect to my red vest dost pay? Does my cock&#x27;s
feather no allegiance claim? Have I my visage masked to - day? Must I be
forced myself to name?
The Witch
Master, forgive this rude salute! But I perceive no cloven foot. And your two
ravens, where are they?
Mephistopheles
This once I must admit your plea; For truly I must own that we Each other
have not seen for many a day. The culture, too, that shapes the world, at last
Hath e&#x27;en the devil in its sphere embraced; The northern phantom from the
scene hath pass&#x27;d, Tail, talons, horns, are nowhere to be traced! As for the
foot, with which I can&#x27;t dispense, &#x27;Twould injure me in company, and hence,
Like many a youthful cavalier, False calves I now have worn for many a year.
The Witch (dancing)
I am beside myself with joy, To see once more the gallant Satan here!
Mephistopheles
Woman, no more that name employ!
The Witch
But why! what mischief hath it done?
Mephistopheles
To fable - books it now doth appertain; But people from the change have
nothing won. Rid of the evil one, the evil ones remain. Lord Baron call thou
me, so is the matter good; Of other cavaliers the mien I wear. Dost make no
question of my gentle blood; See here, this is the scutcheon that I bear! (He
makes an unseemly gesture.)
The Witch
(laughing immoderately)
Ha! Ha! Just like yourself! You are, I ween, The same mad wag that you
have ever been!
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
My friend, learn this to understand, I pray! To deal with witches this is still the
way.
The Witch
Now tell me, gentlemen, what you desire?
Mephistopheles
Of your known juice a goblet we require. But for the very oldest let me ask;
Double its strength with years doth grow.
The Witch
Most willingly! And here I have a flask, From which I&#x27;ve sipp&#x27;d myself ere
now; What&#x27;s more, it doth no longer stink; To you a glass I joyfully will give.
(Aside.)
If unprepar&#x27;d, however, this man drink, He hath not, as you know, an hour to
live.
Mephistopheles
He&#x27;s my good friend, with whom &#x27;twill prosper well; I grudge him not the
choicest of thy store. Now draw thy circle, speak thy spell, And straight a
bumper for him pour!
Ha! Ha! Just like yourself! You are, I ween, The same mad wag that you
have ever been!
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
My friend, learn this to understand, I pray! To deal with witches this is still the
way.
The Witch
Now tell me, gentlemen, what you desire?
Mephistopheles
Of your known juice a goblet we require. But for the very oldest let me ask;
Double its strength with years doth grow.
The Witch
Most willingly! And here I have a flask, From which I&#x27;ve sipp&#x27;d myself ere
now; What&#x27;s more, it doth no longer stink; To you a glass I joyfully will give.
(Aside.)
If unprepar&#x27;d, however, this man drink, He hath not, as you know, an hour to
live.
Mephistopheles
He&#x27;s my good friend, with whom &#x27;twill prosper well; I grudge him not the
choicest of thy store. Now draw thy circle, speak thy spell, And straight a
bumper for him pour!
The lofty power Of wisdom&#x27;s dower, From all the world conceal&#x27;d! Who
thinketh not, To him I wot, Unsought it is reveal&#x27;d.
Faust
What nonsense doth the hag propound? My brain it doth well - nigh
confound. A hundred thousand fools or more, Methinks I hear in chorus roar.
Mephistopheles
Incomparable Sibyl cease, I pray! Hand us the liquor without more delay.
And to the very brim the goblet crown! My friend he is, and need not be
afraid; Besides, he is a man of many a grade, Who hath drunk deep already.
(The Witch, with many ceremonies, pours the liquor into a cup; as Faust lifts it
to his mouth, a light flame arises.)
Mephistopheles
Gulp it down! No hesitation! It will prove A cordial, and your heart inspire!
What! with the devil hand and glove, And yet shrink back afraid of fire? (The
Witch dissolves the circle. Faust steps out.)
Mephistopheles
Now forth at once! thou dar&#x27;st not rest.
Witch
And much, sir, may the liquor profit you!
Mephistopheles (to the Witch)
And if to pleasure thee I aught can do, Pray on Walpurgis mention thy
request.
Witch
Here is a song, sung o&#x27;er, sometimes you&#x27;ll see, That &#x27;twill a singular effect
produce.
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
Come, quick, and let thyself be led by me; Thou must perspire, in order that
the juice Thy frame may penetrate through every part. Then noble idleness I
thee will teach to prize, And soon with ecstasy thou&#x27;lt recognise How Cupid
stirs and gambols in thy heart.
Faust
Let me but gaze one moment in the glass! Too lovely was that female form!
Mephistopheles
Nay! nay! A model which all women shall surpass, In flesh and blood ere long
thou shalt survey.
(Aside.)
As works that draught, thou presently shalt greet A Helen in each woman
thou dost meet.
A Street - Faust Meets Margaret
Faust (Margaret passing by)
Faust And Margaret: The meeting of Faust and Margaret.]
Faust
Fair lady, may I thus make free To offer you my arm and company?
Margaret
I am no lady, am not fair, Can without escort home repair.
(She disengages herself and exit.)
Faust
By heaven! This girl is fair indeed! No form like hers can I recall. Virtue she
hath, and modest heed, Is piquant too, and sharp withal. Her cheek&#x27;s soft
light, her rosy lips, No length of time will e&#x27;er eclipse! Her downward glance
in passing by, Deep in my heart is stamp&#x27;d for aye; How curt and sharp her
answer too, To ecstasy the feeling grew!
(Mephistopheles enters.)
Faust
This girl must win for me! Dost hear?
Mephistopheles
Which?
Faust
She who but now passed.
Mephistopheles
What! She? She from confession cometh here, From every sin absolved and
free; I crept near the confessor&#x27;s chair. All innocence her virgin soul, For next
to nothing went she there; O&#x27;er such as she I&#x27;ve no control!
Faust
She&#x27;s past fourteen.
Mephistopheles
You really talk
Like any gay Lothario, Who every floweret from its stalk Would pluck, and
deems nor grace, nor truth, Secure against his arts, forsooth! This ne&#x27;er the
less won&#x27;t always do.
Faust
Sir Moralizer, prithee, pause; Nor plague me with your tiresome laws!
Goethe
To cut the matter short, my friend, She must this very night be mine, And if to
help me you decline, Midnight shall see our compact end.
Mephistopheles
What may occur just bear in mind! A fortnight&#x27;s space, at least, I need, A fit
occasion but to find.
Faust
With but seven hours I could succeed; Nor should I want the devil&#x27;s wile, So
young a creature to beguile.
Mephistopheles
Like any Frenchman now you speak, But do not fret, I pray; why seek To
hurry to enjoyment straight? The pleasure is not half so great, As when at first
around, above, With all the fooleries of love, The puppet you can knead and
mould As in Italian story oft is told.
Faust
No such incentives do I need.
Mephistopheles
But now, without offense or jest! You cannot quickly, I protest, In winning
this sweet child succeed. By storm we cannot take the fort, To stratagem we
must resort.
Faust
Conduct me to her place of rest! Some token of the angel bring! A kerchief
from her snowy breast, A garter bring me, - any thing!
Mephistopheles
That I my anxious zeal may prove, Your pangs to sooth and aid your love, A
single moment will we not delay, Will lead you to her room this very day.
Faust
And shall I see her? - Have her?
Mephistopheles
No! She to a neighbour&#x27;s house will go; But in her atmosphere alone, The
tedious hours meanwhile you may employ, In blissful dreams of future joy.
Faust
Can we go now?
Mephistopheles
&#x27;Tis yet too soon.
Faust
Some present for my love procure!
(Exit.)
Mephistopheles
Presents so soon! &#x27;tis well! success is sure! Full many a goodly place I know,
And treasures buried long ago; I must a bit o&#x27;erlook them now.
(Exit.)
Evening - A Small And Neat Room
Margaret
(braiding and binding up her hair)
I would give something now to know, Who yonder gentleman could be! He
had a gallant air, I trow, And doubtless was of high degree: That written on
his brow was seen Nor else would he so bold have been.
(Exit.)
Mephistopheles
Come in! tread softly! be discreet!
Faust (after a pause)
Begone and leave me, I entreat!
Mephistopheles (looking round)
Not every maiden is so neat
(Exit.)
Faust (gazing round)
Welcome sweet twilight, calm and blest, That in this hallow&#x27;d precinct reigns!
Fond yearning love, inspire my breast, Feeding on hope&#x27;s sweet dew thy
blissful pains! What stillness here environs me! Content and order brood
around. What fulness in this poverty! In this small cell what bliss profound!
(He throws himself on the leather arm - chair beside the bed)
Receive me thou, who hast in thine embrace, Welcom&#x27;d in joy and grief the
ages flown! How oft the children of a by - gone race Have cluster&#x27;d round this
patriarchal throne! Haply she, also, whom I hold so dear, For Christmas gift,
with grateful joy possess&#x27;d, Hath with the full round cheek of childhood, here,
Her grandsire&#x27;s wither&#x27;d hand devoutly press&#x27;d. Maiden! I feel thy spirit haunt
the place, Breathing of order and abounding grace. As with a mother&#x27;s voice it
prompteth thee, The pure white cover o&#x27;er the board to spread, To strew the
crisping sand beneath thy tread. Dear hand! so godlike in its ministry! The hut
becomes a paradise through thee! And here - (He raises the bed - curtain.)
How thrills my pulse with strange delight! Here could I linger hours untold;
Thou, Nature, didst in vision bright, The embryo angel here unfold. Here lay
the child, her bosom warm With life; while steeped in slumber&#x27;s dew, To
perfect grace, her godlike form, With pure and hallow&#x27;d weavings grew!
And thou! ah here what seekest thou? How quails mine inmost being now!
What wouldst thou here? what makes thy heart so sore? Unhappy Faust! I
know thee now no more.
Do I a magic atmosphere inhale? Erewhile, my passion would not brook
delay! Now in a pure love - dream I melt away. Are we the sport of every
passing gale?
Should she return and enter now, How wouldst thou rue thy guilty flame!
Proud vaunter - thou wouldst hide thy brow, And at her feet sink down with
shame.
Mephistopheles
Quick! quick! below I see her there.
Faust
Away! I will return no more!
Mephistopheles
Here is a casket, with a store Of jewels, which I got elsewhere Just lay it in
the press; make haste! I swear to you, &#x27;twill turn her brain; Therein some
trifles I have placed, Wherewith another to obtain. But child is child, and play
is play.
Faust
I know not - shall I?
Mephistopheles
Do you ask? Perchance you would retain the treasure? If such your wish, why
then, I say, Henceforth absolve me from my task, Nor longer waste your
hours of leisure. I trust you&#x27;re not by avarice led! I rub my hands, I scratch my
head,
(He places the casket in the press and closes the lock.)
Now quick! Away! That soon the sweet young creature may The wish and
purpose of your heart obey; Yet stand you there As would you to the lecture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>room repair, As if before you stood, Arrayed in flesh and blood, Physics
and metaphysics weird and grey! Away!
(Exeunt.)
Margaret (with a lamp)
Here &#x27;tis so close, so sultry now,
(She opens the window.)
Yet out of doors &#x27;tis not so warm. I feel so strange, I know not how I wish my
mother would come home. Through me there runs a shuddering I&#x27;m but a
foolish timid thing!
(While undressing herself she begins to sing.)
There was a king in Thule, True even to the grave; To whom his dying
mistress A golden beaker gave.
At every feast he drained it, Naught was to him so dear, And often as he
drained it, Gush&#x27;d from his eyes the tear.
When death came, unrepining His cities o&#x27;er he told; All to his heir resigning,
Except his cup of gold.
With many a knightly vassal At a royal feast sat he, In yon proud hall
ancestral, In his castle o&#x27;er the sea.
Up stood the jovial monarch, And quaff&#x27;d his last life&#x27;s glow, Then hurled the
hallow&#x27;d goblet Into the flood below.
He saw it splashing, drinking, And plunging in the sea; His eyes meanwhile
were sinking, And never again drank he.
(She opens the press to put away her clothes, and perceives the casket.)
How comes this lovely casket here? The press I locked, of that I&#x27;m confident.
&#x27;Tis very wonderful! What&#x27;s in it I can&#x27;t guess; Perhaps &#x27;twas brought by some
one in distress, And left in pledge for loan my mother lent.
Here by a ribbon hangs a little key! I have a mind to open it and see!
Heavens! only look! what have we here! In all my days ne&#x27;er saw I such a
sight! Jewels! which any noble dame might wear, For some high pageant
richly dight! This chain - how would it look on me! These splendid gems,
whose may they be?
(She puts them on and steps before the glass.)
Were but the ear - rings only mine! Thus one has quite another air. What
boots it to be young and fair? It doubtless may be very fine; But then, alas,
none cares for you, And praise sounds half like pity too. Gold all doth lure,
Gold doth secure All things. Alas, we poor!
Promenade - Faust And Mephistopheles
Faust walking thoughtfully up and down. To him Mephistopheles
Mephistopheles
By all rejected love! By hellish fire I curse, Would I knew aught to make my
imprecation worse!
Faust
What aileth thee? what chafes thee now so sore? A face like that I never saw
before!
Mephistopheles
I&#x27;d yield me to the devil instantly, Did it not happen that myself am he!
Faust
There must be some disorder in thy wit! To rave thus like a madman, is it fit?
Mephistopheles
Think! only think! The gems for Gretchen brought, Them hath a priest now
made his own! A glimpse of them the mother caught, And &#x27;gan with secret
fear to groan. The woman&#x27;s scent is keen enough; Doth ever in the prayer -
book snuff; Smells every article to ascertain Whether the thing is holy or
profane, And scented in the jewels rare, That there was not much blessing
there. &quot;My child,&quot; she cries, &quot;ill - gotten good Ensnares the soul, consumes the
blood; With them we&#x27;ll deck our Lady&#x27;s shrine, She&#x27;ll cheer our souls with
bread divine!&quot; At this poor Gretchen &#x27;gan to pout; &#x27;Tis a gift - horse, at least,
she thought, And sure, he godless cannot be, Who brought them here so
cleverly. Straight for a priest the mother sent, Who, when he understood the
jest, With what he saw was well content. &quot;This shows a pious mind!&quot; Quoth
he: &quot;Self - conquest is true victory. The Church hath a good stomach, she,
with zest, Whole countries hath swallow&#x27;d down, And never yet a surfeit
known. The Church alone, be it confessed, Daughters, can ill - got wealth
digest.&quot;
Faust
It is a general custom, too. Practised alike by king and jew.
Mephistopheles
With that, clasp, chain, and ring, he swept As they were mushrooms; and the
casket, Without one word of thanks, he kept, As if of nuts it were a basket.
Promised reward in heaven, then forth he hied And greatly they were edified.
Faust
And Gretchen!
Mephistopheles
In unquiet mood Knows neither what she would or should; The trinkets night
and day thinks o&#x27;er, On him who brought them, dwells still more.
Faust
The darling&#x27;s sorrow grieves me, bring Another set without delay! The first,
methinks, was no great thing.
Mephistopheles
All&#x27;s to my gentleman child&#x27;s play!
Faust
Plan all things to achieve my end! Engage the attention of her friend! No milk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and - water devil be, And bring fresh jewels instantly!
Mephistopheles
Ay, sir! Most gladly I&#x27;ll obey.
(Faust exit.)
Mephistopheles
Your doting love - sick fool, with ease, Merely his lady - love to please, Sun,
moon, and stars in sport would puff away.
(Exit.)
The Neighbour&#x27;s House - Martha, Margaret And Mephistopheles
Martha (alone)
God pardon my dear husband, he Doth not in truth act well by me! Forth in
the world abroad to roam, And leave me on the straw at home. And yet his
will I ne&#x27;er did thwart, God knows, I lov&#x27;d him from my heart.
(She weeps.)
Perchance he&#x27;s dead! - oh wretched state! Had I but a certificate!
(Margaret comes)
Margaret
Dame Martha!
Martha
Gretchen?
Margaret
Only think! My knees beneath me well - nigh sink! Within my press I&#x27;ve found
to - day, Another case, of ebony. And things - magnificent they are, More
costly than the first, by far.
Martha
You must not name it to your mother! It would to shrift, just like the other.
Margaret
Nay look at them! now only see!
Martha (dresses her up)
Thou happy creature!
Margaret
Woe is me! Them in the street I cannot wear, Or in the church, or any where.
Martha
Come often over here to me, The gems put on quite privately; And then
before the mirror walk an hour or so, Thus we shall have our pleasure too.
Then suitable occasions we must seize, As at a feast, to show them by
degrees: A chain at first, pearl ear - drops then, - your mother Won&#x27;t see
them, or we&#x27;ll coin some tale or other.
Margaret
But, who, I wonder, could the caskets bring? I fear there&#x27;s something wrong
about the thing!
(A knock.)
Good heavens! can that my mother be?
Martha (peering through the blind)
&#x27;Tis a strange gentleman, I see. Come in!
(Mephistopheles enters)
Mephistopheles
I&#x27;ve ventur&#x27;d to intrude to - day. Ladies, excuse the liberty, I pray.
(He steps back respectfully before Margaret.)
After dame Martha Schwerdtlein I inquire!
Martha
&#x27;Tis I. Pray what have you to say to me?
Mephistopheles (aside to her)
I know you now, - and therefore will retire; At present you&#x27;ve distinguished
company. Pardon the freedom, Madam, with your leave, I will make free to
call again at eve.
Martha (aloud)
Why, child, of all strange notions, he For some grand lady taketh thee!
Margaret
I am, in truth, of humble blood The gentleman is far too good Nor gems nor
trinkets are my own.
Mephistopheles
Oh &#x27;tis not the mere ornaments alone; Her glance and mien far more betray.
Rejoiced I am that I may stay.
Martha
Your business, Sir? I long to know
Mephistopheles
Would I could happier tidings show! I trust mine errand you&#x27;ll not let me rue;
Your husband&#x27;s dead, and greeteth you.
Martha
Is dead? True heart! Oh misery! My husband dead! Oh, I shall die!
Margaret
Alas! good Martha! don&#x27;t despair!
Mephistopheles
Now listen to the sad affair!
Margaret
I for this cause should fear to love. The loss my certain death would prove.
Mephistopheles
Joy still must sorrow, sorrow joy attend.
Martha
Proceed, and tell the story of his end!
Mephistopheles
At Padua, in St. Anthony&#x27;s, In holy ground his body lies; Quiet and cool his
place of rest, With pious ceremonials blest.
Martha
And had you naught besides to bring?
Mephistopheles
Oh yes! one grave and solemn prayer; Let them for him three hundred masses
sing! But in my pockets, I have nothing there.
Martha
No trinket! no love - token did he send! What every journeyman safe in his
pouch will hoard There for remembrance fondly stored, And rather hungers,
rather begs than spend!
Mephistopheles
Madam, in truth, it grieves me sore, But he his gold not lavishly hath spent.
His failings too he deeply did repent, Ay! and his evil plight bewail&#x27;d still more.
Margaret
Alas! That men should thus be doomed to woe! I for his soul will many a
requiem pray.
Mephistopheles
A husband you deserve this very day; A child so worthy to be loved.
Margaret
Ah no, That time hath not yet come for me.
Mephistopheles
If not a spouse, a gallant let it be. Among heaven&#x27;s choicest gifts, I place, So
sweet a darling to embrace.
Margaret
Our land doth no such usage know.
Mephistopheles
Usage or not, it happens so.
Martha
Go on, I pray!
Mephistopheles
I stood by his bedside. Something less foul it was than dung; &#x27;Twas straw half
rotten; yet, he as a Christian died. And sorely hath remorse his conscience
wrung. &quot;Wretch that I was,&quot; quoth he, with parting breath, &quot;So to forsake my
business and my wife! Ah! the remembrance is my death, Could I but have
her pardon in this life!&quot;
Martha (weeping)
Dear soul! I&#x27;ve long forgiven him, indeed!
Mephistopheles
&quot;Though she, God knows, was more to blame than I.&quot;
Martha
He lied! What, on the brink of death to lie!
Mephistopheles
If I am skill&#x27;d the countenance to read, He doubtless fabled as he parted
hence. &quot;No time had I to gape, or take my ease,&quot; he said, &quot;First to get
children, and then get them bread; And bread, too, in the very widest sense;
Nor could I eat in peace even my proper share.&quot;
Martha
What, all my truth, my love forgotten quite? My weary drudgery by day and
night!
Mephistopheles
Not so! He thought of you with tender care. Quoth he: &quot;Heaven knows how
fervently I prayed, For wife and children when from Malta bound; The prayer
hath heaven with favour crowned; We took a Turkish vessel which conveyed
Rich store of treasure for the Sultan&#x27;s court; It&#x27;s own reward our gallant action
brought; The captur&#x27;d prize was shared among the crew And of the treasure I
received my due.&quot;
Martha
How? Where? The treasure hath he buried, pray?
Mephistopheles
Where the four winds have blown it, who can say? In Naples as he stroll&#x27;d, a
stranger there, A comely maid took pity on my friend; And gave such tokens
of her love and care, That he retained them to his blessed end.
Martha
Scoundrel! to rob his children of their bread! And all this misery, this bitter
need, Could not his course of recklessness impede!
Mephistopheles
Well, he hath paid the forfeit, and is dead. Now were I in your place, my
counsel hear; My weeds I&#x27;d wear for one chaste year, And for another lover
meanwhile would look out.
Martha
Alas, I might search far and near, Not quickly should I find another like my
first! There could not be a fonder fool than mine, Only he loved too well
aboard to roam; Loved foreign women too, and foreign wine, And loved
besides the dice accurs&#x27;d.
Mephistopheles
All had gone swimmingly, no doubt, Had he but given you at home, On his
side, just as wide a range. Upon such terms, to you I swear, Myself with you
would gladly rings exchange!
Martha
The gentleman is surely pleas&#x27;d to jest!
Mephistopheles (aside)
Now to be off in time, were best! She&#x27;d make the very devil marry her.
(To Margaret.)
How fares it with your heart?
Margaret
How mean you, Sir?
Mephistopheles (aside)
The sweet young innocent!
(aloud)
Ladies, farewell!
Margaret
Farewell!
Martha
But ere you leave us, quickly tell! I from a witness fain had heard, Where,
how, and when my husband died and was interr&#x27;d. To forms I&#x27;ve always been
attached indeed, His death I fain would in the journals read.
Mephistopheles
Ay, madam, what two witnesses declare Is held as valid everywhere; A
gallant friend I have, not far from here, Who will for you before the judge
appear. I&#x27;ll bring him straight.
Martha
I pray you do!
Mephistopheles
And this young lady, we shall find her too? A noble youth, far travelled, he
Shows to the sex all courtesy.
Margaret
I in his presence needs must blush for shame.
Mephistopheles
Not in the presence of a crowned king!
Martha
The garden, then, behind my house, we&#x27;ll name, There we&#x27;ll await you both
this evening.
A Street - An Evening Walk In The Garden
Faust. Mephistopheles
Faust
How is it now? How speeds it? Is&#x27;t in train?
Mephistopheles
Bravo! I find you all aflame! Gretchen full soon your own you&#x27;ll name. This
eve, at neighbour Martha&#x27;s, her you&#x27;ll meet again; The woman seems
expressly made To drive the pimp and gipsy&#x27;s trade.
Faust
Good!
Mephistopheles
But from us she something would request.
Faust
A favour claims return as this world goes.
Mephistopheles
We have on oath but duly to attest, That her dead husband&#x27;s limbs,
outstretch&#x27;d repose In holy ground at Padua.
Faust
Sage indeed! So I suppose we straight must journey there!
Mephistopheles
Sancta simplicitas! For that no need! Without much knowledge we have but
to swear.
Faust
If you have nothing better to suggest, Against you plan I must at once protest.
Mephistopheles
Oh, holy man! methinks I have you there! In all your life say, have you ne&#x27;er
False witness borne, until this hour? Have you of God, the world, and all it
doth contain, Of man, and that which worketh in his heart and brain, Not
definitions given, in words of weight and power, With front unblushing, and a
dauntless breast? Yet, if into the depth of things you go, Touching these
matters, it must be confess&#x27;d, As much as of Herr Schwerdtlein&#x27;s death you
know!
Faust
Thou art and dost remain liar and sophist too.
Mephistopheles
Ay, if one did not take a somewhat deeper view! To - morrow, in all honour,
thou Poor Gretchen wilt befool, and vow Thy soul&#x27;s deep love, in lover&#x27;s
fashion.
Faust
And from my heart.
Mephistopheles
All good and fair! Then deathless constancy thou&#x27;lt swear; Speak of one all
o&#x27;ermastering passion, Will that too issue from the heart?
Faust
Forbear! When passion sways me, and I seek to frame Fir utterance for
feeling, deep, intense, And for my frenzy finding no fit name, Sweep round the
ample world with every sense, Grasp at the loftiest words to speak my flame,
And call the glow, wherewith I burn, Quenchless, eternal, yea, eterne Is that
of sophistry a devilish play?
Mephistopheles
Yet am I right!
Faust
Mark this, my friend, And spare my lungs; who would the right maintain, And
hath a tongue wherewith his point to gain, Will gain it in the end. But come, of
gossip I am weary quite; Because I&#x27;ve no resource, thou&#x27;rt in the right.
A Garden
Margaret on Faust&#x27;s arm. Martha with Mephistopheles walking up and down
Margaret
I feel it, you but spare my ignorance, The gentleman to shame me stoops thus
low. A traveller from complaisance, Still makes the best of things; I know Too
well, my humble prattle never can Have power to entertain so wise a man.
Garden Scene: Garden scene with Mephistopheles, Faust, and Margaret.
Lithograph by Eugene Delacroix.]
Faust
One glance, one word from thee doth charm me more, Than the world&#x27;s
wisdom or the sage&#x27;s lore.
(He kisses her hand.)
Margaret
Nay! trouble not yourself! A hand so coarse, So rude as mine, how can you
kiss! What constant work at home must I not do perforce! My mother too
exacting is.
(They pass on.)
Martha
Thus, sir, unceasing travel is your lot?
Mephistopheles
Traffic and duty urge us! With what pain Are we compelled to leave full many
a spot, Where yet we dare not once remain!
Martha
In youth&#x27;s wild years, with vigour crown&#x27;d, &#x27;Tis not amiss thus through the
world to sweep; But ah, the evil days come round! And to a lonely grave as
bachelor to creep, A pleasant thing has no one found.
Mephistopheles
The prospect fills me with dismay.
Martha
Therefore in time, dear sir, reflect, I pray.
(They pass on.)
Margaret
Ay, out of sight is out of mind! Politeness easy is to you; Friends everywhere,
and not a few, Wiser than I am, you will find.
Faust
O dearest, trust me, what doth pass for sense Full oft is self - conceit and
blindness!
Margaret
How?
Faust
Simplicity and holy innocence, When will ye learn your hallow&#x27;d worth to
know! Ah, when will meekness and humility, Kind and all - bounteous
nature&#x27;s loftiest dower
Margaret
Only one little moment think of me! To think of you I shall have many an hour.
Faust
You are perhaps much alone?
Margaret
Yes, small our household is, I own, Yet must I see to it. No maid we keep,
And I must cook, sew, knit, and sweep, Still early on my feet and late; My
mother is in all things, great and small, So accurate! Not that for thrift there is
such pressing need; Than others we might make more show indeed: My father
left behind a small estate, A house and garden near the city - wall. But fairly
quiet now my days, I own; As soldier is my brother gone; My little sister&#x27;s
dead; the babe to rear Occasion&#x27;d me some care and fond annoy; But I
would go through all again with joy, The darling was to me so dear.
Faust
An angel, sweet, if it resembled thee!
Margaret
I reared it up, and it grew fond of me. After my father&#x27;s death it saw the day;
We gave my mother up for lost, she lay In such a wretched plight, and then at
length So very slowly she regain&#x27;d her strength. Weak as she was, &#x27;twas vain
for her to try Herself to suckle the poor babe, so I Reared it on milk and
water all alone; And thus the child became as &#x27;twere my own; Within my arms
it stretched itself and grew, And smiling, nestled in my bosom too.
Faust
Doubtless the purest happiness was thine.
Margaret
But many weary hours, in sooth, were also mine. At night its little cradle stood
Close to my bed; so was I wide awake If it but stirred; One while I was
obliged to give it food, Or to my arms the darling take; From bed full oft must
rise, whene&#x27;er its cry I heard, And, dancing it, must pace the chamber to and
fro; Stand at the wash - tub early; forthwith go To market, and then mind the
cooking too To - morrow like to - day, the whole year through. Ah, sir, thus
living, it must be confess&#x27;d One&#x27;s spirits are not always of the best; Yet it a
relish gives to food and rest. (They pass on.)
Martha
Poor women! we are badly off, I own; A bachelor&#x27;s conversion&#x27;s hard,
indeed!
Mephistopheles
Madam, with one like you it rests alone, To tutor me a better course to lead.
Martha
Speak frankly, sir, none is there you have met? Has your heart ne&#x27;er attach&#x27;d
itself as yet?
Mephistopheles
One&#x27;s own fire - side and a good wife are gold And pearls of price, so says
the proverb old.
Martha
I mean, has passion never stirred your breast?
Mephistopheles
I&#x27;ve everywhere been well received, I own.
Martha
Yet hath your heart no earnest preference known?
Mephistopheles
With ladies one should ne&#x27;er presume to jest.
Martha
Ah! you mistake!
Mephistopheles
I&#x27;m sorry I&#x27;m so blind But this I know - that you are very kind
(They pass on.)
Faust
Me, little angel, didst thou recognize, When in the garden first I came?
Margaret
Did you not see it? I cast down my eyes.
Faust
Thou dost forgive my boldness, dost not blame The liberty I took that day,
When thou from church didst lately wend thy way?
Margaret
I was confused. So had it never been; No one of me could any evil say. Alas,
thought I, he doubtless in thy mien, Something unmaidenly or bold hath seen?
It seemed as if it struck him suddenly, Here&#x27;s just a girl with whom one may
make free! Yet I must own that then I scarcely knew What in your favour
here began at once to plead; Yet I was angry with myself indeed, That I more
angry could not feel with you.
Faust
Sweet love!
Margaret
Just wait awhile!
(She gathers a star - flower and plucks off the leaves one after another.)
Faust
A nosegay may that be?
Margaret
No! It is but a game.
Faust
How?
Margaret
Go, you&#x27;ll laugh at me!
(She plucks off the leaves and murmurs to herself.)
Faust
What murmurest thou?
Margaret (half aloud)
He loves me - loves me not.
Faust
Sweet angel, with thy face of heavenly bliss!
Margaret (continues)
He loves me - not - he loves me - not
(Plucking off the last leaf with fond joy.)
He loves me!
Faust
Yes!
And this flower - language, darling, let it be, A heavenly oracle! He loveth
thee! Know&#x27;st thou the meaning of, He loveth thee? (He seizes both her
hands.)
Margaret
I tremble so!
Faust
Nay! Do not tremble, love! Let this hand - pressure, let this glance reveal
Feelings, all power of speech above; To give oneself up wholly and to feel A
joy that must eternal prove! Eternal! - Yes, its end would be despair. No end!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It cannot end!
(Margaret presses his hand, extricates herself, and runs away. He stands a
moment in thought and then follows her).
Martha (approaching)
Night&#x27;s closing.
Mephistopheles
Yes, we&#x27;ll presently away.
Martha
I would entreat you longer yet to stay; But &#x27;tis a wicked place, just here
about; It is as if the folk had nothing else to do, Nothing to think of too, But
gaping watch their neighbours, who goes in and out; And scandal&#x27;s busy still,
do whatsoe&#x27;er one may. And our young couple?
Mephistopheles
They have flown up there. The wanton butterflies!
Martha
He seems to take to her.
Mephistopheles
And she to him. &#x27;Tis of the world the way!
A Summer-House
(Margaret runs in, hides behind the door, holds the tip of her finger to her lip,
and peeps through the crevice.)
Margaret
He comes!
Faust
Ah, little rogue, so thou Think&#x27;st to provoke me! I have caught thee now!
(He kisses her.)
Margaret
(embracing him, and returning the kiss)
Dearest of men! I love thee from my heart!
(Mephistopheles knocks.)
Faust (stamping)
Who&#x27;s there?
Mephistopheles
A friend!
Faust
A brute!
Mephistopheles
&#x27;Tis time to part.
Martha (comes)
Ay, it is late, good sir.
Faust
Mayn&#x27;t I attend you, then?
Margaret
Oh no - my mother would - adieu, adieu!
Faust
And must I really then take leave of you? Farewell!
Martha
Good - bye!
Margaret
Ere long to meet again! (Exeunt Faust and Mephistopheles.)
Margaret
Good heavens! how all things far and near Must fill his mind, - a man like this!
Abash&#x27;d before him I appear, And say to all things only, yes. Poor simple
child, I cannot see, What &#x27;tis that he can find in me.
(Exit.)
Forest And Cavern - Faust And Mephistopheles
Faust (alone)
Spirit sublime! Thou gav&#x27;st me, gav&#x27;st me all For which I prayed! Not vainly
hast thou turn&#x27;d To me thy countenance in flaming fire: Gavest me glorious
nature for my realm, And also power to feel her and enjoy; Not merely with a
cold and wondering glance, Thou dost permit me in her depths profound, As
in the bosom of a friend to gaze. Before me thou dost lead her living tribes,
And dost in silent grove, in air and stream Teach me to know my kindred.
And when roars The howling storm - blast through the groaning wood,
Wrenching the giant pine, which in its fall Crashing sweeps down its neighbour
trunks and boughs, While hollow thunder from the hill resounds; Then thou
dost lead me to some shelter&#x27;d cave, Dost there reveal me to myself, and
show Of my own bosom the mysterious depths. And when with soothing
beam, the moon&#x27;s pale orb Full in my view climbs up the pathless sky, From
crag and dewy grove, the silvery forms Of by - gone ages hover, and assuage
The joy austere of contemplative thought.
Oh, that naught perfect is assign&#x27;d to man, I feel, alas! With this exalted joy,
Which lifts me near and nearer to the gods, Thou gav&#x27;st me this companion,
unto whom I needs must cling, though cold and insolent, He still degrades me
to myself, and turns Thy glorious gifts to nothing, with a breath. He in my
bosom with malicious zeal For that fair image fans a raging fire; From craving
to enjoyment thus I reel And in enjoyment languish for desire.
(Mephistopheles enters.)
Mephistopheles
Of this lone life have you not your fill? How for so long can it have charms for
you? &#x27;Tis well enough to try it if you will; But then away again to something
new!
Faust
Would you could better occupy your leisure, Than in disturbing thus my hours
of joy.
Mephistopheles
Well! Well! I&#x27;ll leave you to yourself with pleasure, A serious tone you hardly
dare employ. To part from one so crazy, harsh, and cross, Were not in truth a
grievous loss. The live - long day, for you I toil and fret; Ne&#x27;er from his
worship&#x27;s face a hint I get, What pleases him, or what to let alone.
Faust
Ay truly! that is just the proper tone! He wearies me, and would with thanks
be paid!
Mephistopheles
Poor Son of Earth, without my aid, How would thy weary days have flown?
Thee of thy foolish whims I&#x27;ve cured, Thy vain imaginations banished, And but
for me, be well assured, Thou from this sphere must soon have vanished. In
rocky hollows and in caverns drear, Why like an owl sit moping here?
Wherefore from dripping stones and moss with ooze embued, Dost suck, like
any toad, thy food? A rare, sweet pastime. Verily! The doctor cleaveth still to
thee.
Faust
Dost comprehend what bliss without alloy From this wild wand&#x27;ring in the
desert springs? Couldst thou but guess the new life - power it brings, Thou
wouldst be fiend enough to envy me my joy.
Mephistopheles
What super - earthly ecstasy! at night, To lie in darkness on the dewy height,
Embracing heaven and earth in rapture high, The soul dilating to a deity; With
prescient yearnings pierce the core of earth, Feel in your labouring breast the
six - days&#x27; birth, Enjoy, in proud delight what no one knows, While your love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rapture o&#x27;er creation flows, The earthly lost in beatific vision, And then the
lofty intuition
(With a gesture.)
I need not tell you how - to close!
Faust
Fie on you!
Mephistopheles
This displeases you? &quot;For shame!&quot; You are forsooth entitled to exclaim; We
to chaste ears it seems must not pronounce What, nathless, the chaste heart
cannot renounce. Well, to be brief, the joy as fit occasions rise, I grudge you
not, of specious lies. But long this mood thou&#x27;lt not retain. Already thou&#x27;rt
again outworn, And should this last, thou wilt be torn By frenzy or remorse
and pain. Enough of this! Thy true love dwells apart, And all to her seems flat
and tame; Alone thine image fills her heart, She loves thee with an all -
devouring flame. First came thy passion with o&#x27;erpowering rush, Like
mountain torrent, swollen by the melted snow; Full in her heart didst pour the
sudden gush, Now has thy brooklet ceased to flow. Instead of sitting throned
midst forests wild, It would become so great a lord To comfort the enamour&#x27;d
child, And the young monkey for her love reward. To her the hours seem
miserably long; She from the window sees the clouds float by As o&#x27;er the lofty
city - walls they fly, &quot;If I a birdie were!&quot; so runs her song, Half through the
night and all day long. Cheerful sometimes, more oft at heart full sore; Fairly
outwept seem now her tears, Anon she tranquil is, or so appears, And love -
sick evermore.
Faust
Snake! Serpent vile!
Mephistopheles (aside)
Good! If I catch thee with my guile!
Faust
Vile reprobate! go get thee hence; Forbear the lovely girl to name! Nor in my
half - distracted sense, Kindle anew the smouldering flame!
Mephistopheles
What wouldest thou! She thinks you&#x27;ve taken flight; It seems, she&#x27;s partly in
the right.
Faust
I&#x27;m near her still - and should I distant rove, Her I can ne&#x27;er forget, ne&#x27;er lose
her love; And all things touch&#x27;d by those sweet lips of hers, Even the very
Host, my envy stirs.
Mephistopheles
&#x27;Tis well! I oft have envied you indeed, The twin - pair that among the roses
feed.
Faust
Pander, avaunt!
Mephistopheles
Go to! I laugh, the while you rail, The power which fashion&#x27;d youth and maid,
Well understood the noble trade; So neither shall occasion fail. But hence! -
A mighty grief I trow! Unto thy lov&#x27;d one&#x27;s chamber thou And not to death
shouldst go.
Faust
What is to me heaven&#x27;s joy within her arms? What though my life her bosom
warms! Do I not ever feel her woe? The outcast am I not, unhoused, unblest,
Inhuman monster, without aim or rest, Who, like the greedy surge, from rock
to rock, Sweeps down the dread abyss with desperate shock? While she,
within her lowly cot, which graced The Alpine slope, beside the waters wild,
Her homely cares in that small world embraced, Secluded lived, a simple,
artless child. Was&#x27;t not enough, in thy delirious whirl To blast the steadfast
rocks; Her, and her peace as well, Must I, God - hated one, to ruin hurl!
Dost claim this holocaust, remorseless Hell! Fiend, help me to cut short the
hours of dread! Let what must happen, happen speedily! Her direful doom fall
crushing on my head, And into ruin let her plunge with me!
Mephistopheles
Why how again it seethes and glows! Away, thou fool! Her torment ease!
When such a head no issue sees, It pictures straight the final close. Long life
to him who boldly dares! A devil&#x27;s pluck thou&#x27;rt wont to show; As for a devil
who despairs, Nothing I find so mawkish here below.
Margaret&#x27;s Room
Margaret (alone at her spinning wheel)
My peace is gone, My heart is sore, I find it never, And nevermore!
Where him I have not, Is the grave; and all The world to me Is turned to gall.
My wilder&#x27;d brain Is overwrought; My feeble senses Are distraught.
My peace is gone, My heart is sore, I find it never, And nevermore!
For him from the window I gaze, at home; For him and him only Abroad I
roam.
His lofty step, His bearing high, The smile of his lip, The power of his eye,
His witching words, Their tones of bliss, His hand&#x27;s fond pressure And ah -
his kiss! My peace is gone, My heart is sore, I find it never, And nevermore.
My bosom aches To feel him near; Ah, could I clasp And fold him here!
Kiss him and kiss him Again would I, And on his kisses I fain would die.
Martha&#x27;s Garden
Margaret and Faust
Margaret
Promise me, Henry!
Faust
What I can!
Margaret
How thy religion fares, I fain would hear. Thou art a good kind - hearted man,
Only that way not well - disposed, I fear.
Faust
Forbear, my child! Thou feelest thee I love; My heart, my blood I&#x27;d give, my
love to prove, And none would of their faith or church bereave.
Margaret
That&#x27;s not enough, we must ourselves believe!
Faust
Must we?
Margaret
Ah, could I but thy soul inspire! Thou honourest not the sacraments, alas!
Faust
I honour them.
Margaret
But yet without desire; &#x27;Tis long since thou hast been either to shrift or mass.
Dost thou believe in God?
Faust
My darling, who dares say, Yes, I in God believe? Question or priest or sage,
and they Seem, in the answer you receive, To mock the questioner.
Margaret
Then thou dost not believe?
Faust
Sweet one! my meaning do not misconceive! Him who dare name? And who
proclaim, Him I believe? Who that can feel, His heart can steel, To say: I
believe him not? The All - embracer, All - sustainer, Holds and sustains he not
Thee, me, himself? Lifts not the Heaven its dome above? Doth not the firm -
set earth beneath us lie? And beaming tenderly with looks of love, Climb not
the everlasting stars on high? Do we not gaze into each other&#x27;s eyes? Nature&#x27;s
impenetrable agencies, Are they not thronging on thy heart and brain,
Viewless, or visible to mortal ken, Around thee weaving their mysterious
chain? Fill thence thy heart, how large soe&#x27;er it be; And in the feeling when
thou utterly art blest, Then call it, what thou wilt, Call it Bliss! Heart! Love!
God! I have no name for it! &#x27;Tis feeling all; Name is but sound and smoke
Shrouding the glow of heaven.
Margaret
All this is doubtless good and fair; Almost the same the parson says, Only in
slightly different phrase.
Faust
Beneath Heaven&#x27;s sunshine, everywhere, This is the utterance of the human
heart; Each in his language doth the like impart; Then why not I in mine?
Margaret
What thus I hear Sounds plausible, yet I&#x27;m not reconciled; There&#x27;s something
wrong about it; much I fear That thou art not a Christian.
Faust
My sweet child!
Margaret
Alas! it long hath sorely troubled me, To see thee in such odious company.
Faust
How so?
Margaret
The man who comes with thee, I hate, Yea, in my spirit&#x27;s inmost depths
abhor; As his loath&#x27;d visage, in my life before, Naught to my heart e&#x27;er gave a
pang so great.
Faust
Him fear not, my sweet love!
Margaret
His presence chills my blood. Towards all beside I have a kindly mood; Yet,
though I yearn to gaze on thee, I feel At sight of him strange horror o&#x27;er me
steal; That he&#x27;s a villain my conviction&#x27;s strong. May Heaven forgive me, if I
do him wrong!
Faust
Yet such strange fellows in the world must be!
Margaret
I would not live with such an one as he. If for a moment he but enter here, He
looks around him with a mocking sneer, And malice ill - conceal&#x27;d; That he
with naught on earth can sympathize is clear Upon his brow &#x27;tis legibly
revealed, That to his heart no living soul is dear. So blest I feel, within thine
arms, So warm and happy, - free from all alarms; And still my heart doth
close when he comes near.
Faust
Foreboding angel! check thy fear!
Margaret
It so o&#x27;ermasters me, that when, Or wheresoe&#x27;er, his step I hear, I almost
think, no more I love thee then. Besides, when he is near, I ne&#x27;er could pray.
This eats into my heart; with thee The same, my Henry, it must be.
Faust
This is antipathy!
Margaret
I must away.
Faust
For one brief hour then may I never rest, And heart to heart, and soul to soul
be pressed?
Margaret
Ah, if I slept alone! To - night The bolt I fain would leave undrawn for thee;
But then my mother&#x27;s sleep is light, Were we surprised by her, ah me! Upon
the spot I should be dead.
Faust
Dear angel! there&#x27;s no cause for dread. Here is a little phial, - if she take
Mixed in her drink three drops, &#x27;twill steep Her nature in a deep and soothing
sleep.
Margaret
What do I not for thy dear sake! To her it will not harmful prove?</p>
<p>Faust
Should I advise it else, sweet love?
Margaret
I know not, dearest, when thy face I see, What doth my spirit to thy will
constrain; Already I have done so much for thee, That scarcely more to do
doth now remain.
(Exit.)
Mephistopheles (enters)
Mephistopheles
The monkey! Is she gone?
Faust
Again hast played the spy?
Mephistopheles
Of all that pass&#x27;d I&#x27;m well apprized, I heard the doctor catechised, And trust
he&#x27;ll profit much thereby! Fain would the girls inquire indeed Touching their
lover&#x27;s faith and creed, And whether pious in the good old way; They think, if
pliant there, us too he will obey.
Faust
Thou monster, does not see that this Pure soul, possessed by ardent love, Full
of the living faith, To her of bliss The only pledge, must holy anguish prove,
Holding the man she loves, fore - doomed to endless death!
Mephistopheles
Most sensual, supersensualist? The while A damsel leads thee by the nose!
Faust
Of filth and fire abortion vile!
Mephistopheles
In physiognomy strange skill she shows; She in my presence feels she knows
not how; My mask it seems a hidden sense reveals; That I&#x27;m a genius she
must needs allow, That I&#x27;m the very devil perhaps she feels. So then to - night
Faust
What&#x27;s that to you?
Mephistopheles
I&#x27;ve my amusement in it too!
At The Well
Margaret and Bessy, with pitchers
Bessy
Of Barbara hast nothing heard?
Margaret
I rarely go from home, - no, not a word.
Bessy
&#x27;Tis true: Sybilla told me so to - day! That comes of being proud, methinks;
She played the fool at last.
Margaret
How so?
Bessy
They say That two she feedeth when she eats and drinks.
Margaret
Alas!
Bessy
She&#x27;s rightly served, in sooth, How long she hung upon the youth! What
promenades, what jaunts there were, To dancing booth and village fair! The
first she everywhere must shine, He always treating her to pastry and to wine
Of her good looks she was so vain, So shameless too, that to retain His
presents, she did not disdain; Sweet words and kisses came anon And then
the virgin flower was gone.
Margaret
Poor thing!
Bessy
Forsooth dost pity her? At night, when at our wheels we sat, Abroad our
mothers ne&#x27;er would let us stir. Then with her lover she must chat, Or on the
bench or in the dusky walk, Thinking the hours too brief for their sweet talk;
Her proud head she will have to bow, And in white sheet do penance now!
Margaret
But he will surely marry her?
Bessy
Not he! He won&#x27;t be such a fool! a gallant lad Like him, can roam o&#x27;er land
and sea, Besides, he&#x27;s off.
Margaret
That is not fair!
Bessy
If she should get him, &#x27;twere almost as bad! Her myrtle wreath the boys
would tear; And then we girls would plagued her too, For we chopp&#x27;d straw
before her door would strew!
(Exit.)
Margaret (walking towards home)
How stoutly once I could inveigh, If a poor maiden went astray; Not words
enough my tongue could find, &#x27;Gainst others&#x27; sin to speak my mind! Black as it
seemed, I blacken&#x27;d it still more, And strove to make it blacker than before.
And did myself securely bless Now my own trespass doth appear! Yet ah! -
what urg&#x27;d me to transgress, God knows, it was so sweet, so dear!
Zwinger
Enclosure between the City - wall and the Gate.
(In the niche of the wall a devotional image of the Mater dolorosa, with flower</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pots before it)
Margaret (putting fresh flowers in the pots)
Ah, rich in sorrow, thou, Stoop thy maternal brow, And mark with pitying eye
my misery! The sword in thy pierced heart, Thou dost with bitter smart, Gaze
upwards on thy Son&#x27;s death agony. To the dear God on high, Ascends thy
piteous sigh, Pleading for his and thy sore misery. Ah, who can know The
torturing woe, The pangs that rack me to the bone? How my poor heart,
without relief, Trembles and throbs, its yearning grief Thou knowest, thou
alone! Ah, wheresoe&#x27;er I go, With woe, with woe, with woe, My anguish&#x27;d
breast is aching! When all alone I creep, I weep, I weep, I weep, Alas! my
heart is breaking! The flower-pots at my window Were wet with tears of
mine, The while I pluck&#x27;d these blossoms, At dawn to deck thy shrine! When
early in my chamber Shone bright the rising morn, I sat there on my pallet, My
heart with anguish torn. Help! from disgrace and death deliver me! Ah! rich in
sorrow, thou, Stoop thy maternal brow, And mark with pitying eye my
misery!
Night. Street Before Margaret&#x27;s Door
Valentine (a soldier, Margaret&#x27;s brother)
When seated &#x27;mong the jovial crowd, Where merry comrades boasting loud
Each named with pride his favourite lass, And in her honour drain&#x27;d his glass;
Upon my elbows I would lean, With easy quiet view the scene, Nor give my
tongue the rein until Each swaggering blade had talked his fill. Then smiling I
my beard would stroke, The while, with brimming glass, I spoke; &quot;Each to his
taste! - but to my mind, Where in the country will you find, A maid, as my
dear Gretchen fair, Who with my sister can compare?&quot; Cling! Clang! so rang
the jovial sound! Shouts of assent went circling round; Pride of her sex is she!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cried some; Then were the noisy boasters dumb.
And now! - I could tear out my hair, Or dash my brains out in despair! Me
every scurvy knave may twit, With stinging jest and taunting sneer! Like
skulking debtor I must sit, And sweat each casual word to hear! And though I
smash&#x27;d them one and all, Yet them I could not liars call.
Who comes this way? who&#x27;s sneaking here? If I mistake not, two draw near.
If he be one, have at him; - well I wot Alive he shall not leave this spot!
Faust. Mephistopheles
Faust
How from yon sacristy, athwart the night, Its beams the ever - burning taper
throws, While ever waning, fades the glimmering light, As gathering darkness
doth around it close! So night - like gloom doth in my bosom reign.
Mephistopheles
I&#x27;m like a tom - cat in a thievish vein, That up fire - ladders tall and steep, And
round the walls doth slyly creep; Virtuous withal, I feel, with, I confess, A
touch of thievish joy and wantonness. Thus through my limbs already burns
The glorious Walpurgis night! After to - morrow it returns, Then why one
wakes, one knows aright!
Faust
Meanwhile, the treasure I see glimmering there, Will it ascend into the open
air?
Mephistopheles
Ere long thou wilt proceed with pleasure, To raise the casket with its treasure;
I took a peep, therein are stored, Of lion - dollars a rich hoard.
Faust
And not a trinket? not a ring? Wherewith my lovely girl to deck?
Mephistopheles
I saw among them some such thing, A string of pearls to grace her neck.
Faust
&#x27;Tis well! I&#x27;m always loath to go, Without some gift my love to show.
Mephistopheles
Some pleasures gratis to enjoy, Should surely cause you no annoy. While
bright with stars the heavens appear, I&#x27;ll sing a masterpiece of art: A moral
song shall charm her ear, More surely to beguile her heart.
(Sings to the guitar.)
Kathrina say, Why lingering stay At dawn of day Before your lover&#x27;s door?
Maiden, beware, Nor enter there, Lest forth you fare, A maiden never more.
Maiden take heed! Reck well my rede! Is&#x27;t done, the deed? Good night, you
poor, poor thing! The spoiler&#x27;s lies, His arts despise, Nor yield your prize,
Without the marriage ring!
Valentine (steps forward)
Whom are you luring here? I&#x27;ll give it you! Accursed rat - catchers, your
strains I&#x27;ll end! First, to the devil the guitar I&#x27;ll send! Then to the devil with the
singer too!
Mephistopheles
The poor guitar! &#x27;tis done for now.
Valentine
Your skull shall follow next, I trow!
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
Doctor, stand fast! your strength collect! Be prompt, and do as I direct. Out
with your whisk, keep close, I pray, I&#x27;ll parry! do you thrust away!
Valentine
Then parry that!
Mephistopheles
Why not?
Valentine
That too!
Mephistopheles
With ease!
Valentine
The devil fights for you! Why how is this? my hand&#x27;s already lamed!
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
Thrust home!
Valentine (falls)
Alas!
Mephistopheles
There! Now the lubber&#x27;s tamed! But quick, away! We must at once take
wing; A cry of murder strikes upon the ear; With the police I know my course
to steer, But with the blood - ban &#x27;tis another thing.
Martha (at the window)
Without! without!
Margaret (at the window)
Quick, bring a light!
Martha (as above)
They rail and scuffle, scream and fight!
People
One lieth here already dead!
Martha (coming out)
Where are the murderers? are they fled?
Margaret (coming out)
Who lieth here?
People
Thy mother&#x27;s son.
Margaret
Almighty God! I am undone!
Valentine
I&#x27;m dying - &#x27;tis a soon - told tale, And sooner done the deed. Why, women,
do ye howl and wail? To my last words give heed! (All gather round him.) My
Gretchen see! still young art thou, Art not discreet enough, I trow, Thou dost
thy matters ill; Let this in confidence be said: Since thou the path of shame
dost tread, Tread it with right good will!
Margaret
My brother! God! what can this mean?
Valentine
Abstain, Nor dare God&#x27;s holy name profane! What&#x27;s done, alas, is done and
past! Matters will take their course at last; By stealth thou dost begin with
one, Others will follow him anon; And when a dozen thee have known,
Thou&#x27;lt common be to all the town. When infamy is newly born, In secret she
is brought to light, And the mysterious veil of night O&#x27;er head and ears is
drawn; The loathsome birth men fain would slay; But soon, full grown, she
waxes bold, And though not fairer to behold, With brazen front insults the
day: The more abhorrent to the sight, The more she courts the day&#x27;s pure
light.
The time already I discern, When thee all honest folk will spurn, And shun thy
hated form to meet, As when a corpse infects the street. Thy heart will sink in
blank despair, When they shall look thee in the face! A golden chain no more
thou&#x27;lt wear! Nor near the altar take in church thy place! In fair lace collar
simply dight Thou&#x27;lt dance no more with spirits light! In darksome corners
thou wilt bide, Where beggars vile and cripples hide, And e&#x27;en though God
thy crime forgive, On earth, a thing accursed, thou&#x27;lt live!
Martha
Your parting soul to God commend! Your dying breath in slander will you
spend?
Valentine
Could I but reach thy wither&#x27;d frame, Thou wretched beldame, void of
shame! Full measure I might hope to win Of pardon then for every sin.
Margaret
Brother! what agonizing pain!
Valentine
I tell thee, from vain tears abstain! &#x27;Twas thy dishonour pierced my heart, Thy
fall the fatal death - stab gave. Through the death - sleep I now depart To
God, a soldier true and brave. (dies.)

Evil - Spirit behind Margaret
Evil - Spirit
How different, Gretchen, was it once with thee, When thou, still full of
innocence, Here to the altar camest, And from the small and well - conn&#x27;d
book Didst lisp thy prayer, Half childish sport, Half God in thy young heart!
Gretchen! What thoughts are thine? What deed of shame Lurks in thy sinful
heart? Is thy prayer utter&#x27;d for thy mother&#x27;s soul, Who into long, long torment
slept through thee? Whose blood is on thy threshold? - And stirs there not
already &#x27;neath thy heart Another quick&#x27;ning pulse, that even now Tortures
itself and thee With its foreboding presence?
Margaret
Woe! Woe! Oh could I free me from the thoughts That hither, thither, crowd
upon my brain, Against my will!
Chorus
Dies irae, dies illa, Solvet saeclum in favilla.
(The organ sounds.)
Evil - Spirit
Grim horror seizes thee! The trumpet sounds! The graves are shaken! And
thy heart From ashy rest For torturing flames A new created, Trembles into
life!
Margaret
Would I were hence! It is as if the organ Choked my breath, As if the choir
Melted my inmost heart!
Chorus
Judex ergo cum sedebit, Quidquid latet adparebit, Nil inultum remanebit.
Margaret
I feel oppressed! The pillars of the wall Imprison me! The vaulted roof
Weighs down upon me! - air!
Evil - Spirit
Wouldst hide thee? sin and shame Remain not hidden! Air! light! Woe&#x27;s thee!
Chorus
Quid sum miser tunc dicturus? Quem patronum rogaturus! Cum vix justus sit
securus.
Evil - Spirit
The glorified their faces turn Away from thee! Shudder the pure to reach
Their hands to thee! Woe!
Chorus
Quid sum miser tunc dicturus

Neighbour! your smelling bottle!

Walpurgis - Night
Act four, scene one, &quot;Walpurgis Night&quot; theme from the opera &quot;Faust&quot; 1859,
by Charles Gounod. Over the heather, marshes, meadows, Light as a feather,
Eerie shadows, Airily flashing lower, higher, flaming and flashing, glowing fire,
they float, they hover, below, above, In fields of clover, In wood and grove,
Flames burning brightly, Rays blazing red, Souls drifting lightly, Souls of the
dead.
The Hartz Mountains. District of Schierke and Elend
Faust and Mephistopheles
Mephistopheles
A broomstick dost thou not at least desire? The roughest he - goat fain would
I bestride, By this road from our goal we&#x27;re still far wide.
Faust
While fresh upon my legs, so long I naught require, Except this knotty staff.
Beside, What boots it to abridge a pleasant way? Along the labyrinth of these
vales to creep, Then scale these rocks, whence, in eternal spray, Adown the
cliffs the silvery fountains leap: Such is the joy that seasons paths like these!
Spring weaves already in the birchen trees; E&#x27;en the late pine - grove feels her
quickening powers; Should she not work within these limbs of ours?
Mephistopheles
Naught of this genial influence do I know! Within me all is wintry. Frost and
snow I should prefer my dismal path to bound. How sadly, yonder, with
belated glow Rises the ruddy moon&#x27;s imperfect round, Shedding so faint a
light, at every tread One&#x27;s sure to stumble &#x27;gainst a rock or tree! An Ignis
Fatuus I must call instead. Yonder one burning merrily, I see. Holla! my
friend! may I request your light? Why should you flare away so uselessly? Be
kind enough to show us up the height!
Ignis Fatuus
Through reverence, I hope I may subdue The lightness of my nature; true, Our
course is but a zigzag one.
Mephistopheles
Ho! ho!
So men, forsooth, he thinks to imitate! Now, in the devil&#x27;s name, for once go
straight! Or out at once your flickering life I&#x27;ll blow.
Ignis Fatuus
That you are master here is obvious quite; To do your will, I&#x27;ll cordially essay;
Only reflect! The hill is magic - mad to - night; And if to show the path you
choose a meteor&#x27;s light, You must not wonder should we go astray.
Faust, Mephistopheles, Ignis Fatuus (in alternate song)
Through the dream and magic - sphere, As it seems, we now are speeding;
Honour win, us rightly leading, That betimes we may appear In yon wide and
desert region!
Trees on trees, a stalwart legion, Swiftly past us are retreating, And the cliffs
with lowly greeting; Rocks long - snouted, row on row, How they snort, and
how they blow!
Through the stones and heather springing, Brook and brooklet haste below;
Hark the rustling! Hark the singing! Hearken to love&#x27;s plaintive lays; Voices of
those heavenly days What we hope, and what we love! Like a tale of olden
time, Echo&#x27;s voice prolongs the chime.
To - whit! To - whoo! It sounds more near; Plover, owl and jay appear, All
awake, around, above? Paunchy salamanders too Peer, long - limbed, the
bushes through! And, like snakes, the roots of trees
Coil themselves from rock and sand, Stretching many a wondrous band, Us
to frighten, us to seize; From rude knots with life embued, Polyp - fangs
abroad they spread, To snare the wanderer! &#x27;Neath our tread, Mice, in
myriads, thousand - hued, Through the heath and through the moss! And the
fire - flies&#x27; glittering throng, Wildering escort, whirls along, Here and there, our
path across. Tell me, stand we motionless, Or still forward do we press? All
things round us whirl and fly; Rocks and trees make strange grimaces,
Dazzling meteors change their places, How they puff and multiply!
Mephistopheles
Now grasp my doublet - we at last A central peak have reached, which
shows, If round a wondering glance we cast, How in the mountain Mammon
glows,
Faust
How through the chasms strangely gleams, A lurid light, like dawn&#x27;s red glow,
Pervading with its quivering beams, The gorges of the gulf below! Here
vapours rise, there clouds float by, Here through the mist the light doth shine;
Now, like a fount, it bursts on high, Meanders now, a slender line; Far
reaching, with a hundred veins, Here through the valley see it glide; Here,
where its force the gorge restrains, At once it scatters, far and wide; Anear,
like showers of golden sand Strewn broadcast, sputter sparks of light: And
mark yon rocky walls that stand Ablaze, in all their towering height!
Mephistopheles
Doth not Sir Mammon for this fete Grandly illume his palace! Thou Art lucky
to have seen it; now, The boisterous guests, I feel, are coming straight.
Faust
How through the air the storm doth whirl! Upon my neck it strikes with
sudden shock.
Mephistopheles
Cling to these ancient ribs of granite rock, Else to yon depths profound it you
will hurl. A murky vapour thickens night. Hark! Through the woods the
tempests roar! The owlets flit in wild affright. Hark! Splinter&#x27;d are the columns
that upbore The leafy palace, green for aye: The shivered branches whirr and
sigh, Yawn the huge trunks with mighty groan. The roots upriven, creak and
moan! In fearful and entangled fall, One crashing ruin whelms them all, While
through the desolate abyss, Sweeping the wreck - strewn precipice, The
raging storm - blasts howl and hiss! Aloft strange voices dost thou hear?
Distant now and now more near? Hark! the mountain ridge along, Streameth
a raving magic - song!
Witches And Wizards Chorus - Visions And Dances
Witches (in chorus)
Now to the Brocken the witches hie, The stubble is yellow, the corn is green;
Thither the gathering legions fly, And sitting aloft is Sir Urian seen: O&#x27;er stick
and o&#x27;er stone they go whirling along, Witches and he - goats, a motley
throng,
Voices
Alone old Baubo&#x27;s coming now; She rides upon a farrow sow.
Chorus
Honour to her, to whom honour is due! Forward, Dame Baubo! Honour to
you! A goodly sow and mother thereon, The whole witch chorus follows
anon.
Voice
Which way didst come?
Voice
O&#x27;er Ilsenstein! There I peep&#x27;d in an owlet&#x27;s nest. With her broad eye she
gazed in mine!
Voice
Drive to the devil, thou hellish pest! Why ride so hard?
Voice
She has graz&#x27;d my side, Look at the wounds, how deep and how wide!
Witches (in chorus)
The way is broad, the way is long; What mad pursuit! What tumult wild!
Scratches the besom and sticks the prong; Crush&#x27;d is the mother, and stifled
the child.
Wizards (half chorus)
Like house - encumber&#x27;d snail we creep; While far ahead the women keep,
For when to the devil&#x27;s house we speed, By a thousand steps they take the
lead.
The Other Half
Not so, precisely do we view it; They with a thousand steps may do it; But let
them hasten as they can, With one long bound &#x27;tis clear&#x27;d by man.
Voices (above)
Come with us, come with us from Felsensee.
Voices (from below)
Aloft to you we would mount with glee! We wash, and free from all stain are
we, Yet barren evermore must be!
Both Choruses
The wind is hushed, the stars grow pale, The pensive moon her light doth veil;
And whirling on, the magic choir Sputters forth sparks of drizzling fire.
Voice (from below)
Stay! stay!
Voice (from above)
What voice of woe Calls from the cavern&#x27;d depths below?
Voice (from below)
Take me with you! Oh take me too! Three centuries I climb in vain, And yet
can ne&#x27;er the summit gain! To be with my kindred I am fain.
Both Choruses
Broom and pitch - fork, goat and prong, Mounted on these we whirl along;
Who vainly strives to climb to - night, Is evermore a luckless wight!
Demi - Witch (below)
I hobble after, many a day; Already the others are far away! No rest at home
can I obtain Here too my efforts are in vain!
Chorus of Witches
Salve gives the witches strength to rise; A rag for a sail does well enough; A
goodly ship is every trough; To - night who flies not, never flies.
Both Choruses
And when the topmost peak we round, Then alight ye on the ground; The
heath&#x27;s wide regions cover ye With your mad swarms of witchery!
(They let themselves down.)
Mephistopleles
They crowd and jostle, whirl and flutter! They whisper, babble, twirl, and
splutter! They glimmer, sparkle, stink and flare A true witch - element!
Beware! Stick close! else we shall severed be. Where art thou?
Faust (in the distance)
Here!
Mephistopheles
Already, whirl&#x27;d so far away! The master then indeed I needs must play. Give
ground! Squire Voland comes! Sweet folk, give ground! Here, doctor, grasp
me! With a single bound Let us escape this ceaseless jar; Even for me too
mad these people are. Hard by there shineth something with peculiar glare,
Yon brake allureth me; it is not far; Come, come along with me! we&#x27;ll slip in
there.
Faust
Spirit of contradiction! Lead! I&#x27;ll follow straight! &#x27;Twas wisely done, however,
to repair On May - night to the Brocken, and when there By our own choice
ourselves to isolate!
Mephistopheles
Mark, of those flames the motley glare! A merry club assembles there. In a
small circle one is not alone.
Faust
I&#x27;d rather be above, though, I must own! Already fire and eddying smoke I
view; The impetuous millions to the devil ride; Full many a riddle will be there
untied.
Mephistopheles
Ay! and full many a riddle tied anew. But let the great world rave and riot!
Here will we house ourselves in quiet. A custom &#x27;tis of ancient date, Our
lesser worlds within the great world to create! Young witches there I see,
naked and bare, And old ones, veil&#x27;d more prudently. For my sake only
courteous be! The trouble&#x27;s small, the sport is rare. Of instruments I hear the
cursed din One must get used to it. Come in! come in! There&#x27;s now no help
for it. I&#x27;ll step before And introducing you as my good friend, Confer on you
one obligation more. How say you now? &#x27;Tis no such paltry room; Why only
look, you scarce can see the end. A hundred fires in rows disperse the gloom;
They dance, they talk, they cook, make love, and drink: Where could we find
aught better, do you think?
Faust
To introduce us, do you purpose here As devil or as wizard to appear?
Mephistopheles
Though I am wont indeed to strict incognito, Yet upon gala - days one must
one&#x27;s orders show. No garter have I to distinguish me, Nathless the cloven
foot doth here give dignity. Seest thou yonder snail? Crawling this way she
hies: With searching feelers, she, no doubt, Hath me already scented out;
Here, even if I would, for me there&#x27;s no disguise. From fire to fire, we&#x27;ll
saunter at our leisure, The gallant you, I&#x27;ll cater for your pleasure.
(To a party seated round some expiring embers.)
Old gentleman, apart, why sit ye moping here? Ye in the midst should be of all
this jovial cheer, Girt round with noise and youthful riot; At home one surely
has enough of quiet.
General
In nations put his trust, who may, Whate&#x27;er for them one may have done; For
with the people, as with women, they Honour your rising stars alone!
Minister
Now all too far they wander from the right; I praise the good old ways, to
them I hold, Then was the genuine age of gold, When we ourselves were
foremost in men&#x27;s sight.
Parvenu
Ne&#x27;er were we &#x27;mong your dullards found, And what we ought not, that to do
were fair; Yet now are all things turning round and round, When on firm basis
we would them maintain.
Author
Who, as a rule, a treatise now would care To read, of even moderate sense?
As for the rising generation, ne&#x27;er Has youth displayed such arrogant
pretence.
Mephistopheles
(suddenly appearing very old)
Since for the last time I the Brocken scale, That folk are ripe for doomsday,
now one sees; And just because my cask begins to fail, So the whole world is
also on the lees.
Huckster - Witch
Stop, gentlemen, nor pass me by, Of wares I have a choice collection: Pray
honour them with your inspection. Lose not his opportunity! Yet nothing in my
booth you&#x27;ll find Without its counterpart on earth; there&#x27;s naught, Which to the
world, and to mankind, Hath not some direful mischief wrought. No dagger
here, which hath not flow&#x27;d with blood, No chalice, whence, into some
healthy frame Hath not been poured hot poison&#x27;s wasting flood. No trinket,
but hath wrought some woman&#x27;s shame, No weapon but hath cut some
sacred tie, Or from behind hath stabb&#x27;d an enemy.
Mephistopheles
Gossip! For wares like these the time&#x27;s gone by, What&#x27;s done is past! what&#x27;s
past is done! With novelties your booth supply; Us novelties attract alone.
Faust
May this wild scene my senses spare! This, may in truth be called a fair!
Mephistopheles
Upward the eddying concourse throng; Thinking to push, thyself art push&#x27;d
along.
Faust
Who&#x27;s that, pray?
Mephistopheles
Mark her well! That&#x27;s Lilith.
Faust
Who?
Mephistopheles
Adam&#x27;s first wife. Of her rich locks beware! That charm in which she&#x27;s
parallel&#x27;d by few; When in its toils a youth she doth ensnare, He will not soon
escape, I promise you.
Faust
There sit a pair, the old one with the young; Already they have bravely
danced and sprung!
Mephistopheles
Here there is no repose to - day. Another dance begins; we&#x27;ll join it, come
away!
Faust
(dancing with the young one)
Once a fair vision came to me; There in I saw an apple - tree, Two beauteous
apples charmed mine eyes; I climb&#x27;d forthwith to reach the prize.
The Fair One
Apples still fondly ye desire, From paradise it hath been so. Feelings of joy
my breast inspire That such too in my garden grow.
Mephistopheles (with the old one)
Once a weird vision came to me; Therein I saw a rifted tree. It had a . . . . . . ;
But as it was it pleased me too.
The Old One
I beg most humbly to salute The gallant with the cloven foot! Let him a . . .
have ready here, If he a . . . does not fear.
Proctophantasmist
Accursed mob! How dare ye thus to meet? Have I not shown and
demonstrated too, That ghosts stand not on ordinary feet? Yet here ye dance,
as other mortals do!
The Fair One (dancing)
Then at our ball, what doth he here?
Faust (dancing)
Oh! He must everywhere appear. He must adjudge, when others dance; If on
each step his say&#x27;s not said, So is that step as good as never made. He&#x27;s most
annoyed, so soon as we advance; If ye would circle in one narrow round, As
he in his old mill, then doubtless he Your dancing would approve, - especially
If ye forthwith salute him with respect profound!
Proctophantasmist
Still here! what arrogance! unheard of quite! Vanish; we now have fill&#x27;d the
world with light! Laws are unheeded by the devil&#x27;s host; Wise as we are, yet
Tegel hath its ghost! How long at this conceit I&#x27;ve swept with all my might,
Lost is the labour: &#x27;tis unheard of quite!
The Fair One
Cease here to teaze us any more, I pray.
Proctophantasmist
Spirits, I plainly to your face declare: No spiritual control myself will bear,
Since my own spirit can exert no sway.
(The dancing continues.)
To - night, I see, I shall in naught succeed; But I&#x27;m prepar&#x27;d my travels to
pursue, And hope, before my final step indeed, To triumph over bards and
devils too.
Mephistopheles
Now in some puddle will he take his station, Such is his mode of seeking
consolation; Where leeches, feasting on his rump, will drain Spirits alike and
spirit from his brain.
(To Faust, who has left the dance.)
But why the charming damsel leave, I pray, Who to you in the dance so
sweetly sang?
Faust
Ah, in the very middle of her lay, Out of her mouth a small red mouse there
sprang.
Mephistopheles
Suppose there did! One must not be too nice. &#x27;Twas well it was not grey, let
that suffice. Who &#x27;mid his pleasures for a trifle cares?
Faust
Then saw I
Mephistopheles
What?
Faust
Mephisto, seest thou there Standing far off, a lone child, pale and fair? Slow
from the spot her drooping form she tears, And seems with shackled feet to
move along; I own, within me the delusion&#x27; strong, That she the likeness of my
Gretchen wears.
Mephistopheles
Gaze not upon her! &#x27;Tis not good! Forbear! &#x27;Tis lifeless, magical, a shape of
air, An idol. Such to meet with, bodes no good; That rigid look of hers doth
freeze man&#x27;s blood, And well - nigh petrifies his heart to stone: The story of
Medusa thou hast known.
Faust
Ay, verily! a corpse&#x27;s eyes are those, Which there was no fond loving hand to
close. That is the bosom I so fondly press&#x27;d, That my sweet Gretchen&#x27;s form,
so oft caress&#x27;d!
Mephistopheles
Deluded fool! &#x27;Tis magic, I declare! To each she doth his lov&#x27;d one&#x27;s image
wear.
Faust
What bliss! what torture! vainly I essay To turn me from that piteous look
away. How strangely doth a single crimson line Around that lovely neck its
coil entwine, It shows no broader than a knife&#x27;s blunt edge!
Mephistopheles
Quite right. I see it also, and allege That she beneath her arm her head can
bear, Since Perseus cut it off. - But you I swear Are craving for illusion still!
Come then, ascend yon little hill! As on the Prater all is gay, And if my senses
are not gone, I see a theatre, - what&#x27;s going on?
Servibilis
They are about to recommence; - the play Will be the last of seven, and spick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>span new &#x27;Tis usual here that number to present. A dilettante did the piece
invent, And dilettanti will enact it too. Excuse me, gentlemen; to me&#x27;s assign&#x27;d
As dilettante to uplift the curtain.
Mephistopheles
You on the Blocksberg I&#x27;m rejoiced to find, That &#x27;tis your most appropriate
sphere is certain.
Walpurgis - Night&#x27;s Dream Or Oberon And Titania&#x27;s Golden Wedding-Feast
Intermezzo
The Theatre
Manager
Vales, where mists still shift and play, To ancient hills succeeding, These our
scenes; - so we, to - day, May rest, brave sons of Mieding.
Herald
That the marriage golden be, Must fifty years be ended; More dear this feast
of gold to me, Contention now suspended.
Oberon
Spirits, if present, grace the scene. And if with me united, Then gratulate the
king and queen, Their troth thus newly plighted!
Puck
Puck draws near and wheels about, In mazy circles dancing! Hundreds swell
his joyous shout, Behind him still advancing.
Ariel
Ariel wakes his dainty air, His lyre celestial stringing. Fools he lureth, and the
fair, With his celestial singing.
Oberon
Wedded ones, would ye agree, We court your imitation: Would ye fondly
love as we, We counsel separation.
Titania
If husband scold and wife retort, Then bear them far asunder; Her to the
burning south transport, And him the North Pole under.
The Whole Orchestra (fortissimo)
Flies and midges all unite With frog and chirping cricket, Our orchestra
throughout the night, Resounding in the thicket!
(Solo)
Yonder doth the bagpipe come! Its sack an airy bubble. Schnick, schnick,
schnack, with nasal hum, Its notes it doth redouble.
Embryo Spirit
Spider&#x27;s foot and midge&#x27;s wing, A toad in form and feature; Together verses it
can string, Though scarce a living creature.
A Little Pair
Tiny step and lofty bound, Through dew and exhalation; Ye trip it deftly on
the ground, But gain no elevation.
Inquisitive Traveller
Can I indeed believe my eyes? Is&#x27;t not mere masquerading? What! Oberon in
beauteous guise, Among the groups parading!
Orthodox
No claws, no tail to whisk about, To fright us at our revel; Yet like the gods
of Greece, no doubt, He too&#x27;s a genuine devil.
Northern Artist
These that I&#x27;m hitting off to - day Are sketches unpretending; Towards Italy
without delay, My steps I think of bending.
Purist
Alas! ill - fortune leads me here, Where riot still grows louder; And &#x27;mong the
witches gather&#x27;d here But two alone wear powder!
Young Witch
Your powder and your petticoat, Suit hags, there&#x27;s no gainsaying; Hence I sit
fearless on my goat, My naked charms displaying.
Matron
We&#x27;re too well - bred to squabble here, Or insult back to render; But may
you wither soon, my dear, Although so young and tender.
Leader of the Band
Nose of fly and gnat&#x27;s proboscis, Throng not the naked beauty! Frogs and
crickets in the mosses, Keep time and do your duty!
Weathercock (towards one side)
What charming company I view Together here collected! Gay bachelors, a
hopeful crew. And brides so unaffected!
Weathercock (towards the other side)
Unless indeed the yawning ground Should open to receive them, From this
vile crew, with sudden bound, To Hell I&#x27;d jump and leave them.
Xenien
With small sharp shears, in insect guise Behold us at your revel! That we may
tender, filial - wise, Our homage to the devil.
Hennings
Look now at yonder eager crew, How naively they&#x27;re jesting! That they have
tender hearts and true, They stoutly keep protesting!
Musaget
Oneself amid this witchery How pleasantly one loses; For witches easier are
to me To govern than the Muses!
Ci - devant Genius of the Age
With proper folks when we appear, No one can then surpass us! Keep close,
wide is the Blocksberg here As Germany&#x27;s Parnassus.
Inquisitive Traveller
How name ye that stiff formal man, Who strides with lofty paces? He tracks
the game where&#x27;er he can, &quot;He scents the Jesuits&#x27; traces.&quot;
Crane
Where waters troubled are or clear, To fish I am delighted; Thus pious
gentlemen appear With devils here united.
Worldling
By pious people, it is true, No medium is rejected; Conventicles, and not a
few, On Blocksberg are erected.
Dancer
Another chorus now succeeds, Far off the drums are beating. Be still! The
bitterns &#x27;mong the reeds Their one note are repeating.
Dancing Master
Each twirls about and never stops, And as he can he fareth. The crooked
leaps, the clumsy hops, Nor for appearance careth.
Fiddler
To take each other&#x27;s life, I trow, Would cordially delight them! As Orpheus&#x27;
lyre the beasts, so now The bagpipe doth unite them.
Dogmatist
My views, in spite of doubt and sneer, I hold with stout persistence, Inferring
from the devils here, The evil one&#x27;s existence.
Idealist
My every sense rules Phantasy With sway quite too potential; Sure I&#x27;m
demented if the I Alone is the essential.
Realist
This entity&#x27;s a dreadful bore, And cannot choose but vex me; The ground
beneath me ne&#x27;er before Thus totter&#x27;d to perplex me.
Supernaturalist
Well pleased assembled here I view Of spirits this profusion; From devils,
touching angels too, I gather some conclusion.
Sceptic
The ignis fatuus they track out, And think they&#x27;re near the treasure. Devil
alliterates with doubt, Here I abide with pleasure.
Leader of the Band
Frog and cricket in the mosses, Confound your gasconading! Nose of fly and
gnat&#x27;s proboscis; Most tuneful serenading!
The Knowing Ones
Sans - souci, so this host we greet, Their jovial humour showing; There&#x27;s now
no walking on our feet, So on our heads we&#x27;re going.
The Awkward Ones
In seasons past we snatch&#x27;d, &#x27;tis true, Some tit - bits by our cunning; Our
shoes, alas, are now danced through, On our bare soles we&#x27;re running.
Will - o&#x27; - the - Wisps
From marshy bogs we sprang to light, Yet here behold us dancing; The gayest
gallants of the night, In glitt&#x27;ring rows advancing.
Shooting Star
With rapid motion from on high, I shot in starry splendour; Now prostrate on
the grass I lie; Who aid will kindly render?
The Massive Ones
Room! wheel round! They&#x27;re coming lo! Down sink the bending grasses.
Though spirits, yet their limbs, we know, Are huge substantial masses.
Puck
Don&#x27;t stamp so heavily, I pray; Like elephants you&#x27;re treading! And &#x27;mong the
elves be Puck to - day, The stoutest at the wedding!
Ariel
If nature boon, or subtle sprite, Endow your soul with pinions; Then follow to
yon rosy height, Through ether&#x27;s calm dominions!
Orchestra (pianissimo)
Drifting cloud and misty wreathes Are fill&#x27;d with light elysian; O&#x27;er reed and
leaf the zephyr breathes So fades the fairy vision!
A Gloomy Day. A Plain
Faust and Mephistopheles
Faust
In misery! despairing! long wandering pitifully on the face of the earth and
now imprisoned! This gentle hapless creature, immured in the dungeon as a
malefactor and reserved for horrid tortures! That it should come to this! To
this! - Perfidious, worthless spirit, and this thou hast concealed from me!
Stand! ay, stand! roll in malicious rage thy fiendish eyes! Stand and brave me
with thine insupportable presence! Imprisoned! In hopeless misery! Delivered
over to the power of evil spirits and the judgment of unpitying humanity! And
me, the while, thou wert lulling with tasteless dissipations, concealing from me
her growing anguish, and leaving her to perish without help!
Mephistopheles
She is not the first.
Faust
Hound! Execrable monster! - Back with him, oh thou infinite spirit! back with
the reptile into his dog&#x27;s shape, in which it was his wont to scamper before me
at eventide, to roll before the feet of the harmless wanderer, and to fasten on
his shoulders when he fell! Change him again into his favourite shape, that he
may crouch on his belly before me in the dust, whilst I spurn him with my foot,
the reprobate! - Not the first! - Woe! Woe! By no human soul is it
conceivable, that more than one human creature has ever sunk into a depth of
wretchedness like this, or that the first in her writhing death agony should not
have atoned in the sight of all - pardoning Heaven for the guilt of all the rest!
The misery of this one pierces me to the very marrow, and harrows up my
soul; thou art grinning calmly over the doom of thousands!
Mephistopheles
Now we are once again at our wit&#x27;s end, just where the reason of you mortals
snaps! Why dost thou seek our fellowship, if thou canst not go through with
it? Wilt fly, and art not proof against dizziness? Did we force ourselves on
thee, or thou on us?
Faust
Cease thus to gnash thy ravenous fangs at me! I loathe thee! - Great and
glorious spirit, thou who didst vouchsafe to reveal thyself unto me, thou who
dost know my very heart and soul, why hast thou linked me with this base
associate, who feeds on mischief and revels in destruction?
Mephistopheles
Hast done?
Faust
Save her! - or woe to thee! The direst of curses on thee for thousands of
years!
Mephistopheles
I cannot loose the bands of the avenger, nor withdraw his bolts. - Save her! -
Who was it plunged her into perdition? I or thou?
(Faust looks wildly around.)
Mephistopheles
Would&#x27;st grasp the thunder? Well for you, poor mortals, that &#x27;tis not yours to
wield! To smite to atoms the being however innocent, who obstructs his path,
such is the tyrant&#x27;s fashion of relieving himself in difficulties!
Faust
Convey me thither! She shall be free!
Mephistopheles
And the danger to which thou dost expose thyself? Know, the guilt of blood,
shed by thy hand, lies yet upon the town. Over the place where fell the
murdered one, avenging spirits hover and watch for the returning murderer.
Faust
This too from thee? The death and downfall of a world be on thee, monster!
Conduct me thither, I say, and set her free!
Mephistopheles
I will conduct thee. And what I can do, - hear! Have I all power in heaven
and upon earth! I&#x27;ll cloud the senses of the warder, - do thou possess thyself
of the keys and lead her forth with human hand! I will keep watch! The magic
steeds are waiting, I bear thee off. Thus much is in my power.
Faust
Up and away!
Night. Open Country
Faust. Mephistopheles
(Rushing along on black horses)
Faust
What weave they yonder round the Ravenstone?
Mephistopheles
I know not what they shape and brew.
Faust
They&#x27;re soaring, swooping, bending, stooping.
Mephistopheles
A witche&#x27;s pack.
Faust
They charm, they strew.
Mephistopheles
On! On!
Dungeon
Faust
(with a bunch of keys and a lamp before a small iron door)
A fear unwonted o&#x27;er my spirit falls; Man&#x27;s concentrated woe o&#x27;erwhelms me
here! She dwells immur&#x27;d within these dripping walls; Her only trespass a
delusion dear! Thou lingerest at the fatal door, Thou dread&#x27;st to see her face
once more? On! While thou dalliest, draws her death - hour near.
(He seizes the lock. Singing within.)
My mother, the harlot, She took me and slew! My father, the scoundrel, Hath
eaten me too! My sweet little sister Hath all my bones laid, Where soft
breezes whisper All in the cool shade!
Then became I a wood - bird, and sang on the spray, Fly away! little bird, fly
away! fly away!
Faust (opening the lock)
Ah! she forebodes not that her lover&#x27;s near, The clanking chains, the rustling
straw, to hear.
(He enters.)
Dungeon Scene: Dungeon scene with Mephistopheles, Faust, and Margaret.
Lithograph by Eugene Delacroix.]
Margaret
(hiding her face in the bed of straw)
Woe! woe! they come! on bitter &#x27;tis to die!
Faust (softly)
Hush! hush! be still! I come to set thee free!
Margaret
(throwing herself at his feet)
If thou art human, feel my misery!
Faust
Thou wilt awake the jailor with thy cry!
(He grasps the chains to unlock them.)
Margaret (on her knees)
Who, headsman, unto thee this power O&#x27;er me could give? Thou com&#x27;st for
me at midnight - hour. Be merciful, and let me live! Is morrow&#x27;s dawn not time
enough? (She stands up.)
I&#x27;m still so young, so young And must so early die! Fair was I too, and that
was my undoing. My love is now afar, he then was nigh; Torn lies the garland,
the fair blossoms strew&#x27;d. Nay, seize me not with hand so rude! Spare me!
What harm have I e&#x27;er done to thee? Oh let me not in vain implore! I ne&#x27;er
have seen thee in my life before!
Faust
Can I endure this bitter agony?
Margaret
I now am at thy mercy quite. Let me my babe but suckle once again! I
fondled it the live - long night; They took it from me but to give me pain, And
now, they say that I my child have slain. Gladness I ne&#x27;er again shall know.
Then they sing songs about me, - &#x27;tis wicked of the throng An ancient ballad
endeth so; Who bade them thus apply the song?
Faust
(throwing himself on the ground)
A lover at thy feet bends low, To loose the bonds of wretchedness and woe.
Margaret
(throws herself beside him)
Oh, let us kneel and move the saints by prayer! Look! look! yon stairs below,
Under the threshold there, Hell&#x27;s flames are all aglow! Beneath the floor, With
hideous noise, The devils roar!
Faust (aloud)
Gretchen! Gretchen!
Margaret (listening)
That was my lov&#x27;d one&#x27;s voice!
(She springs up, the chains fall off.)
Where is he? I heard him calling me. Free am I! There&#x27;s none shall hinder me.
To his neck will I fly, On his bosom will lie! Gretchen, he called! - On yon
threshold he stood; Amidst all the howling of hell&#x27;s fiery flood, The scoff and
the scorn of its devilish crew, The tones of his voice, sweet and loving, I
knew.
Faust
&#x27;Tis I!
Margaret
&#x27;Tis thou! O say so once again!
(embracing him.)
&#x27;Tis he! &#x27;Tis he! where&#x27;s now the torturing pain? Where are the fetters? where
the dungeon&#x27;s gloom? &#x27;Tis thou! To save me thou art come! And I am sav&#x27;d!
Already now the street I see Where the first time I caught a glimpse of thee.
There too the pleasant garden shade, Where I and Martha for thy coming
stay&#x27;d.
Faust
(endeavouring to lead her away)
Come! come away!
Margaret
Oh do not haste!
I love to linger where thou stayest. (caressing him.)
Faust
Ah haste! For if thou still delayest, Our lingering we shall both deplore.
Margaret
How, dearest? canst thou kiss no more! So short a time away from me, and
yet, To kiss thou couldst so soon forget! Why on thy neck so anxious do I
feel When formerly a perfect heaven of bliss From thy dear looks and words
would o&#x27;er me steal? As thou wouldst stifle me thou then didst kiss! Kiss me!
Or I&#x27;ll kiss thee! (She embraces him.) Woe! woe! Thy lips are cold, Are
dumb! Thy love where hast thou left? Who hath me of thy love bereft?
(She turns away from him.)
Faust
Come! Follow me, my dearest love, be bold! I&#x27;ll cherish thee with ardour
thousand - fold; I but entreat thee now to follow me!
Margaret
(turning towards him)
And art thou he? and art thou really he?
Faust
&#x27;Tis I! O come!
Margaret
Thou wilt strike off my chain, And thou wilt take me to thine arms again. How
comes it that thou dost not shrink from me? And dost thou know, love, whom
thou wouldst set free?
Faust
Come! come! already night begins to wane.
Margaret
I sent my mother to her grave, I drown&#x27;d my child beneath the wave. Was it
not given to thee and me - thee too? &#x27;Tis thou thyself! I scarce believe it yet.
Give me thy hand! It is no dream! &#x27;Tis true! Thine own dear hand! - But how
is this? &#x27;Tis wet? Quick, wipe it off! Meseems that yet There&#x27;s blood thereon.
Ah God! what hast thou done? Put up thy sword, I beg of thee!
Faust
Oh, dearest, let the past forgotten be! Death is in every word.
Margaret
No, thou must linger here in sorrow! The graves I will describe to thee, And
thou to them must see To - morrow: The best place give to my mother, Close
at her side my brother, Me at some distance lay But not too far away! And
the little one place on my right breast, Nobody else will near me lie! To nestle
beside thee so lovingly, That was a rapture, gracious and sweet! A rapture I
never again shall prove; Methinks I would force myself on thee, love, And
thou dost spurn me, and back retreat Yet &#x27;tis thyself, thy fond kind looks I
see.
Faust
If thou dost feel &#x27;tis I, then come with me!
Margaret
What, there? without?
Faust
Yes, forth in the free air.
Margaret
Ay, if the grave&#x27;s without, - If death lurk there! Hence to the everlasting
resting - place, And not one step beyond! - Thou&#x27;rt leaving me? Oh Henry!
would that I could go with thee!
Faust
Thou canst! But will it! Open stands the door.
Margaret
I dare not go! I&#x27;ve naught to hope for more. What boots it to escape? They
lurk for me! &#x27;Tis wretched to beg, as I must do, And with an evil conscience
thereto! &#x27;Tis wretched, in foreign lands to stray; And me they will catch, do
what I may!
Faust
With thee will I abide.
Margaret
Quick! Quick! Save thy poor child! Keep to the path The brook along, Over
the bridge To the wood beyond, To the left, where the plank is, In the pond.
Seize it at once! It fain would rise, It struggles still! Save it. Oh save!
Faust
Dear Gretchen, more collected be! One little step, and thou art free!
Margaret
Were we but only past the hill! There sits my mother upon a stone My brain,
alas, is cold with dread! There sits my mother upon a stone, And to and fro
she shakes her head; She winks not, she nods not, her head it droops sore;
She slept so long, she waked no more; She slept, that we might taste of bliss:
Ah! those were happy times, I wis!
Faust
Since here avails nor argument nor prayer, Thee hence by force I needs must
bear.
Margaret
Loose me! I will not suffer violence! With murderous hand hold not so fast! I
have done all to please thee in the past!
Faust
Day dawns! My love! My love!
Margaret
Yes! day draws near. The day of judgment too will soon appear! It should
have been my bridal! No one tell, That thy poor Gretchen thou hast known
too well. Woe to my garland! Its bloom is o&#x27;er! Though not at the dance We
shall meet once more. The crowd doth gather, in silence it rolls; The squares,
the streets, Scarce hold the throng. The staff is broken, - the death - bell tolls,
They bind and seize me! I&#x27;m hurried along, To the seat of blood already I&#x27;m
bound! Quivers each neck as the naked steel Quivers on mine the blow to
deal The silence of the grave now broods around!
Faust
Would I had ne&#x27;er been born!
Mephistopheles (appears without)
Up! or you&#x27;re lost. Vain hesitation! Babbling, quaking! My steeds are
shivering, Morn is breaking.
Margaret
What from the floor ascendeth like a ghost? &#x27;Tis he! &#x27;Tis he! Him from my
presence chase! What would he in this holy place? It is for me he cometh!
Faust
Thou shalt live!
Margaret
Judgment of God! To thee my soul I give!
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
Come, come! With her I&#x27;ll else abandon thee!
Margaret
Father, I&#x27;m thine! Do thou deliver me! Ye angels! Ye angelic hosts! descend,
Encamp around to guard me and defend! Henry! I shudder now to look on
thee!
Mephistopheles
She now is judged!
Voices (from above)
Is saved!
Mephistopheles (to Faust)
Come thou with me!
(Vanishes with Faust.)
Voice (from within, dying away)
Henry! Henry!</p>
