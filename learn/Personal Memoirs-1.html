<p>by Philip Henry Sheridan</p>
<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>When, yielding to the solicitations of my friends, I finally decided</p>
<p>to write these Memoirs, the greatest difficulty which confronted me</p>
<p>was that of recounting my share in the many notable events of the</p>
<p>last three decades, in which I played a part, without entering too</p>
<p>fully into the history of these years, and at the same time without</p>
<p>giving to my own acts an unmerited prominence.  To what extent I have</p>
<p>overcome this difficulty I must leave the reader to judge.</p>
<p>In offering this record, penned by my own hand, of the events of my</p>
<p>life, and of my participation in our great struggle for national</p>
<p>existence, human liberty, and political equality, I make no</p>
<p>pretension to literary merit; the importance of the subject-matter of</p>
<p>my narrative is my only claim on the reader&#x27;s attention.</p>
<p>Respectfully dedicating this work to my comrades in arms during the</p>
<p>War of the Rebellion, I leave it as a heritage to my children, and as</p>
<p>a source of information for the future historian.</p>

<p>PERSONAL MEMOIRS</p>
<p>P. H. SHERIDAN.</p>
<p>VOLUME I.</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<p>ANCESTRY--BIRTH--EARLY EDUCATION--A CLERK IN A GROCERY STORE--</p>
<p>APPOINTMENT--MONROE SHOES--JOURNEY TO WEST POINT--HAZING--A FISTICUFF</p>
<p>BATTLE--SUSPENDED--RETURNS TO CLERKSHIP--GRADUATION.</p>
<p>My parents, John and Mary Sheridan, came to America in 1830, having</p>
<p>been induced by the representations of my father&#x27;s uncle, Thomas</p>
<p>Gainor, then living in Albany, N. Y., to try their fortunes in the</p>
<p>New World: They were born and reared in the County Cavan, Ireland,</p>
<p>where from early manhood my father had tilled a leasehold on the</p>
<p>estate of Cherrymoult; and the sale of this leasehold provided him</p>
<p>with means to seek a new home across the sea.  My parents were</p>
<p>blood relations--cousins in the second degree--my mother, whose</p>
<p>maiden name was Minor, having descended from a collateral branch of</p>
<p>my father&#x27;s family.  Before leaving Ireland they had two children,</p>
<p>and on the 6th of March, 1831, the year after their arrival in this</p>
<p>country, I was born, in Albany, N. Y., the third child in a family</p>
<p>which eventually increased to six--four boys and two girls.</p>
<p>The prospects for gaining a livelihood in Albany did not meet the</p>
<p>expectations which my parents had been led to entertain, so in 1832</p>
<p>they removed to the West, to establish themselves in the village of</p>
<p>Somerset, in Perry County, Ohio, which section, in the earliest days</p>
<p>of the State; had been colonized from Pennsylvania and Maryland.  At</p>
<p>this period the great public works of the Northwest--the canals and</p>
<p>macadamized roads, a result of clamor for internal improvements--were</p>
<p>in course of construction, and my father turned his attention to</p>
<p>them, believing that they offered opportunities for a successful</p>
<p>occupation.  Encouraged by a civil engineer named Bassett, who had</p>
<p>taken a fancy to him, he put in bids for a small contract on the</p>
<p>Cumberland Road, known as the &quot;National Road,&quot; which was then being</p>
<p>extended west from the Ohio River.  A little success in this first</p>
<p>enterprise led him to take up contracting as a business, which he</p>
<p>followed on various canals and macadamized roads then building in</p>
<p>different parts of the State of Ohio, with some good fortune for</p>
<p>awhile, but in 1853 what little means he had saved were swallowed up</p>
<p>--in bankruptcy, caused by the failure of the Sciota and Hocking</p>
<p>Valley Railroad Company, for which he was fulfilling a contract at</p>
<p>the time, and this disaster left him finally only a small farm, just</p>
<p>outside the village of Somerset, where he dwelt until his death in</p>
<ol start="1875">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>My father&#x27;s occupation kept him away from home much of the time</p>
<p>during my boyhood, and as a consequence I grew up under the sole</p>
<p>guidance and training of my mother, whose excellent common sense and</p>
<p>clear discernment in every way fitted her for such maternal duties.</p>
<p>When old enough I was sent to the village school, which was taught by</p>
<p>an old-time Irish &quot;master&quot;--one of those itinerant dominies of the</p>
<p>early frontier--who, holding that to spare the rod was to spoil the</p>
<p>child, if unable to detect the real culprit when any offense had been</p>
<p>committed, would consistently apply the switch to the whole school</p>
<p>without discrimination.  It must be conceded that by this means he</p>
<p>never failed to catch the guilty mischief-maker.  The school-year was</p>
<p>divided into terms of three months, the teacher being paid in each</p>
<p>term a certain sum--three dollars, I think, for each pupil-and having</p>
<p>an additional perquisite in the privilege of boarding around at his</p>
<p>option in the different families to which his scholars belonged.</p>
<p>This feature was more than acceptable to the parents at times, for</p>
<p>how else could they so thoroughly learn all the neighborhood gossip?</p>
<p>But the pupils were in almost unanimous opposition, because Mr.</p>
<p>McNanly&#x27;s unheralded advent at any one&#x27;s house resulted frequently in</p>
<p>the discovery that some favorite child had been playing &quot;hookey,&quot;</p>
<p>which means (I will say to the uninitiated, if any such there be)</p>
<p>absenting one&#x27;s self from school without permission, to go on a</p>
<p>fishing or a swimming frolic.  Such at least was my experience more</p>
<p>than once, for Mr. McNanly particularly favored my mother&#x27;s house,</p>
<p>because of a former acquaintanceship in Ireland, and many a time a</p>
<p>comparison of notes proved that I had been in the woods with two</p>
<p>playfellows, named Binckly and Greiner, when the master thought I was</p>
<p>home, ill, and my mother, that I was at school, deeply immersed in</p>
<p>study.  However, with these and other delinquencies not uncommon</p>
<p>among boys, I learned at McNanly&#x27;s school, and a little later, under</p>
<p>a pedagogue named Thorn, a smattering of geography and history, and</p>
<p>explored the mysteries of Pike&#x27;s Arithmetic and Bullions&#x27; English</p>
<p>Grammar, about as far as I could be carried up to the age of</p>
<p>fourteen.  This was all the education then bestowed upon me, and</p>
<p>this--with the exception of progressing in some of these branches by</p>
<p>voluntary study, and by practical application in others, supplemented</p>
<p>by a few months of preparation after receiving my appointment as a</p>
<p>cadet--was the extent of my learning on entering the Military</p>
<p>Academy.</p>
<p>When about fourteen years old I began to do something for myself; Mr.</p>
<p>John Talbot, who kept a country store in the village, employing me to</p>
<p>deal out sugar, coffee, and calico to his customers at the munificent</p>
<p>salary of twenty-four dollars a year.  After I had gained a twelve-</p>
<p>months&#x27; experience with Mr. Talbot my services began to be sought by,</p>
<p>others, and a Mr. David Whitehead secured them by the offer of sixty</p>
<p>dollars a year--Talbot refusing to increase my pay, but not objecting</p>
<p>to my advancement.  A few months later, before my year was up,</p>
<p>another chance to increase my salary came about; Mr. Henry Dittoe,</p>
<p>the enterprising man of the village, offering me one hundred and</p>
<p>twenty dollars a year to take a position in the dry-goods store of</p>
<p>Fink &amp; Dittoe.  I laid the matter before Mr. Whitehead, and he</p>
<p>frankly advised me to accept, though he cautioned me that I might</p>
<p>regret it, adding that he was afraid Henry (referring to Mr. Dittoe)</p>
<p>&quot;had too many irons in the fire.&quot; His warning in regard to the</p>
<p>enterprising merchant proved a prophecy, for &quot; too many irons in the</p>
<p>fire&quot; brought about Mr. Dittoe&#x27;s bankruptcy, although this misfortune</p>
<p>did not befall him till long after I had left his service.  I am glad</p>
<p>to say, however, that his failure was an exceptionally honest one,</p>
<p>and due more to the fact that he was in advance of his surroundings</p>
<p>than to any other cause.</p>
<p>I remained with Fink &amp; Dittoe until I entered the Military Academy,</p>
<p>principally in charge of the book-keeping, which was no small work</p>
<p>for one of my years, considering that in those days the entire</p>
<p>business of country stores in the West was conducted on the credit</p>
<p>system; the customers, being mostly farmers, never expecting to pay</p>
<p>till the product of their farms could be brought to market; and even</p>
<p>then usually squared the book-accounts by notes of hand, that were</p>
<p>often slow of collection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the time I ceased to attend school my employment had</p>
</blockquote>
<p>necessitated, to a certain degree, the application of what I had</p>
<p>learned there, and this practical instruction I reinforced somewhat</p>
<p>by doing considerable reading in a general way, until ultimately I</p>
<p>became quite a local authority in history, being frequently chosen as</p>
<p>arbiter in discussions and disputes that arose in the store.  The</p>
<p>Mexican War, then going on, furnished, of course, a never-ending</p>
<p>theme for controversy, and although I was too young to enter the</p>
<p>military service when volunteers were mustering in our section, yet</p>
<p>the stirring events of the times so much impressed and absorbed me</p>
<p>that my sole wish was to become a soldier, and my highest aspiration</p>
<p>to go to West Point as a Cadet from my Congressional district.  My</p>
<p>chances for this seemed very remote, however, till one day an</p>
<p>opportunity was thrown in my way by the boy who then held the place</p>
<p>failing to pass his examination.  When I learned that by this</p>
<p>occurrence a vacancy existed, I wrote to our representative in</p>
<p>Congress, the Hon. Thomas Ritchey, and asked him for the appointment,</p>
<p>reminding him that we had often met in Fink &amp; Dittoe&#x27;s store, and</p>
<p>that therefore he must know something of my qualifications.  He</p>
<p>responded promptly by enclosing my warrant for the class of 1848; so,</p>
<p>notwithstanding the many romances that have been published about the</p>
<p>matter, to Mr. Ritchey, and to him alone, is due all the credit--if</p>
<p>my career justifies that term--of putting me in the United States</p>
<p>Army.</p>
<p>At once I set about preparing for the examination which precedes</p>
<p>admission to the Military Academy, studying zealously under the</p>
<p>direction of Mr. William Clark; my old teachers, McNanly and Thorn,</p>
<p>having disappeared from Somerset and sought new fields of usefulness.</p>
<p>The intervening months passed rapidly away, and I fear that I did not</p>
<p>make much progress, yet I thought I should be able to pass the</p>
<p>preliminary examination.  That which was to follow worried me more</p>
<p>and gave me many sleepless nights; but these would have been less in</p>
<p>number, I fully believe, had it not been for one specification of my,</p>
<p>outfit which the circular that accompanied my appointment demanded.</p>
<p>This requirement was a pair of &quot;Monroe shoes.&quot;  Now, out in Ohio,</p>
<p>what &quot;Monroe shoes&quot; were was a mystery--not a shoemaker in my section</p>
<p>having so much as an inkling of the construction of the perplexing</p>
<p>things, until finally my eldest brother brought an idea of them from</p>
<p>Baltimore, when it was found that they were a familiar pattern under</p>
<p>another name.</p>
<p>At length the time for my departure came, and I set out for West</p>
<p>Point, going by way of Cleveland and across Lake Erie to Buffalo.  On</p>
<p>the steamer I fell in with another appointee en route to the academy,</p>
<p>David S. Stanley, also from Ohio; and when our acquaintanceship had</p>
<p>ripened somewhat, and we had begun to repose confidence in each</p>
<p>other, I found out that he had no &quot;Monroe shoes,&quot; so I deemed myself</p>
<p>just that much ahead of my companion, although my shoes might not</p>
<p>conform exactly to the regulations in Eastern style and finish.  At</p>
<p>Buffalo, Stanley and I separated, he going by the Erie Canal and I by</p>
<p>the railroad, since I wanted to gain time on account of commands to</p>
<p>stop in Albany to see my father&#x27;s uncle.  Here I spent a few days,</p>
<p>till Stanley reached Albany, when we journeyed together down the</p>
<p>river to West Point.  The examination began a few days after our</p>
<p>arrival, and I soon found myself admitted to the Corps of Cadets, to</p>
<p>date from July 1, 1848, in a class composed of sixty-three members,</p>
<p>many of whom--for example, Stanley, Slocum, Woods, Kautz, and Crook-</p>
<p>-became prominent generals in later years, and commanded divisions,</p>
<p>corps, and armies in the war of the rebellion.</p>
<p>Quickly following my admission I was broken in by a course of hazing,</p>
<p>with many of the approved methods that the Cadets had handed down</p>
<p>from year to year since the Academy was founded; still, I escaped</p>
<p>excessive persecution, although there were in my day many occurrences</p>
<p>so extreme as to call forth condemnation and an endeavor to suppress</p>
<p>the senseless custom, which an improved civilization has now about</p>
<p>eradicated, not only at West Point, but at other colleges.</p>
<p>Although I had met the Academic board and come off with fair success,</p>
<p>yet I knew so little of Algebra or any of the higher branches of</p>
<p>mathematics that during my first six months at the Academy I was</p>
<p>discouraged by many misgivings as to the future, for I speedily</p>
<p>learned that at the January examination the class would have to stand</p>
<p>a test much severer than that which had been applied to it on</p>
<p>entering.  I resolved to try hard, however, and, besides, good</p>
<p>fortune gave me for a room-mate a Cadet whose education was more</p>
<p>advanced than mine, and whose studious habits and willingness to aid</p>
<p>others benefited me immensely.  This room-mate was Henry W. Slocum,</p>
<p>since so signally distinguished in both military and civil capacities</p>
<p>as to win for his name a proud place in the annals of his country.</p>
<p>After taps--that is, when by the regulations of the Academy all the</p>
<p>lights were supposed to be extinguished, and everybody in bed--Slocum</p>
<p>and I would hang a blanket over the one window of our room and</p>
<p>continue our studies--he guiding me around scores of stumbling-blocks</p>
<p>in Algebra and elucidating many knotty points in other branches of</p>
<p>the course with which I was unfamiliar.  On account of this</p>
<p>association I went up before the Board in January with less</p>
<p>uneasiness than otherwise would have been the case, and passed the</p>
<p>examination fairly well.  When it was over, a self-confidence in my</p>
<p>capacity was established that had not existed hitherto, and at each</p>
<p>succeeding examination I gained a little in order of merit till my</p>
<p>furlough summer came round--that is, when I was half through the</p>
<p>four-year course.</p>
<p>My furlough in July and August, 1850, was spent at my home in Ohio,</p>
<p>with the exception of a visit or two to other Cadets on furlough in</p>
<p>the State, and at the close of my leave I returned to the Academy in</p>
<p>the full expectation of graduating with my class in 1852.</p>
<p>A quarrel of a belligerent character in September, ,1851, with Cadet</p>
<p>William R. Terrill, put an end to this anticipation, however, and</p>
<p>threw me back into the class which graduated in 1853.  Terrill was a</p>
<p>Cadet Sergeant, and, while my company was forming for parade, having,</p>
<p>given me an order, in what I considered an improper tone, to &quot;dress&quot;</p>
<p>in a certain direction, when I believed I was accurately dressed, I</p>
<p>fancied I had a grievance, and made toward him with a lowered</p>
<p>bayonet, but my better judgment recalled me before actual contact</p>
<p>could take place.  Of course Terrill reported me for this, and my ire</p>
<p>was so inflamed by his action that when we next met I attacked him,</p>
<p>and a fisticuff engagement in front of barracks followed, which was</p>
<p>stopped by an officer appearing on the scene.  Each of us handed in</p>
<p>an explanation, but mine was unsatisfactory to the authorities, for I</p>
<p>had to admit that I was the assaulting party, and the result was that</p>
<p>I was suspended by the Secretary of War, Mr. Conrad, till August 28,</p>
<p>1852--the Superintendent of the Academy, Captain Brewerton, being</p>
<p>induced to recommend this milder course, he said, by my previous good</p>
<p>conduct.  At the time I thought, of course, my suspension a very</p>
<p>unfair punishment, that my conduct was justifiable and the</p>
<p>authorities of the Academy all wrong, but riper experience has led me</p>
<p>to a different conclusion, and as I look back, though the</p>
<p>mortification I then endured was deep and trying, I am convinced that</p>
<p>it was hardly as much as I deserved for such an outrageous breach of</p>
<p>discipline.</p>
<p>There was no question as to Terrill&#x27;s irritating tone, but in giving</p>
<p>me the order he was prompted by the duty of his position as a file</p>
<p>closer, and I was not the one to remedy the wrong which I conceived</p>
<p>had been done me, and clearly not justifiable in assuming to correct</p>
<p>him with my own hands.  In 1862, when General Buell&#x27;s army was</p>
<p>assembling at Louisville, Terrill was with it as a brigadier-general</p>
<p>(for, although a Virginian, he had remained loyal), and I then took</p>
<p>the initiative toward a renewal of our acquaintance.  Our renewed</p>
<p>friendship was not destined to be of long duration, I am sorry to</p>
<p>say, for a few days later, in the battle of Perryville, while</p>
<p>gallantly fighting for his country, poor Terrill was killed.</p>
<p>My suspension necessitated my leaving the Academy, and I returned</p>
<p>home in the fall of 1851, much crestfallen.  Fortunately, my good</p>
<p>friend Henry Dittoe again gave me employment in keeping the books of</p>
<p>his establishment, and this occupation of my time made the nine</p>
<p>months which were to elapse before I could go back to West Point pass</p>
<p>much more agreeably than they would have done had I been idle.  In</p>
<p>August, 1852, I joined the first class at the Academy in accordance</p>
<p>with the order of the War Department, taking my place at the foot of</p>
<p>the class and graduating with it the succeeding June, number thirty-</p>
<p>four in a membership of fifty-two.  At the head of this class</p>
<p>graduated James B. McPherson, who was killed in the Atlanta campaign</p>
<p>while commanding the Army of the Tennessee.  It also contained such</p>
<p>men as John M. Schofield, who commanded the Army of the Ohio; Joshua</p>
<p>W. Sill, killed as a brigadier in the battle of Stone River; and many</p>
<p>others who, in the war of the rebellion, on one side or the other,</p>
<p>rose to prominence, General John B. Hood being the most distinguished</p>
<p>member of the class among the Confederates.</p>
<p>At the close of the final examination I made no formal application</p>
<p>for assignment to any particular arm of the service, for I knew that</p>
<p>my standing would not entitle me to one of the existing vacancies,</p>
<p>and that I should be obliged to take a place among the brevet second</p>
<p>lieutenants.  When the appointments were made I therefore found</p>
<p>myself attached to the First Infantry, well pleased that I had</p>
<p>surmounted all the difficulties that confront the student at our</p>
<p>national school, and looking forward with pleasant anticipation to</p>
<p>the life before me.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<p>ORDERED TO FORT DUNCAN, TEXAS--&quot;NORTHERS&quot;--SCOUTING DUTY--HUNTING--</p>
<p>NEARLY CAUGHT BY THE INDIANS--A PRIMITIVE HABITATION--A BRAVE</p>
<p>DRUMMERBOYS DEATH--A MEXICAN BALL.</p>
<p>On the 1st day of July, 1853, I was commissioned a brevet second</p>
<p>lieutenant in the First Regiment of United States Infantry, then</p>
<p>stationed in Texas.  The company to which I was attached was</p>
<p>quartered at Fort Duncan, a military post on the Rio Grande opposite</p>
<p>the little town of Piedras Negras, on the boundary line between the</p>
<p>United States and the Republic of Mexico.</p>
<p>After the usual leave of three months following graduation from the</p>
<p>Military Academy I was assigned to temporary duty at Newport</p>
<p>Barracks, a recruiting station and rendezvous for the assignment of</p>
<p>young officers preparatory to joining their regiments.  Here I</p>
<p>remained from September, 1853, to March, 1854, when I was ordered to</p>
<p>join my company at Fort Duncan.  To comply with this order I</p>
<p>proceeded by steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New</p>
<p>Orleans, thence by steamer across the Gulf of Mexico to Indianola,</p>
<p>Tex., and after landing at that place, continued in a small schooner</p>
<p>through what is called the inside channel on the Gulf coast to Corpus</p>
<p>Christi, the headquarters of Brigadier-General Persifer F. Smith, who</p>
<p>was commanding the Department of Texas.  Here I met some of my old</p>
<p>friends from the Military Academy, among them Lieutenant Alfred</p>
<p>Gibbs, who in the last year of the rebellion commanded under me a</p>
<p>brigade of cavalry, and Lieutenant Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, of the</p>
<p>Mounted Rifles, who resigned in 1854 to accept service in the French</p>
<p>Imperial army, but to most of those about headquarters I was an</p>
<p>entire stranger.  Among the latter was Captain Stewart Van Vliet, of</p>
<p>the Quartermaster&#x27;s Department, now on the retired list.  With him I</p>
<p>soon came in frequent contact, and, by reason of his connection with</p>
<p>the Quartermaster&#x27;s Department, the kindly interest he took in</p>
<p>forwarding my business inaugurated between us--a lasting friendship.</p>
<p>A day or two after my arrival at Corpus Christi a train of Government</p>
<p>wagons, loaded with subsistence stores and quartermaster&#x27;s supplies,</p>
<p>started for Laredo, a small town on the Rio Grande below Fort Duncan.</p>
<p>There being no other means of reaching my station I put my small</p>
<p>personal possessions, consisting of a trunk, mattress, two blankets,</p>
<p>and a pillow into one of the heavily loaded wagons and proceeded to</p>
<p>join it, sitting on the boxes or bags of coffee and sugar, as I might</p>
<p>choose.  The movement of the train was very slow, as the soil was</p>
<p>soft on the newly made and sandy roads.  We progressed but a few</p>
<p>miles on our first day&#x27;s journey, and in the evening parked our train</p>
<p>at a point where there was no wood, a scant supply of water--and that</p>
<p>of bad quality--but an abundance of grass.  There being no</p>
<p>comfortable place to sleep in any of the wagons, filled as they were</p>
<p>to the bows with army supplies, I spread my blankets on the ground</p>
<p>between the wheels of one of them, and awoke in the morning feeling</p>
<p>as fresh and bright as would have been possible if all the comforts</p>
<p>of civilization had been at my command.</p>
<p>It took our lumbering train many days to reach Laredo, a distance of</p>
<p>about one hundred and sixty miles from Corpus Christi.  Each march</p>
<p>was but a repetition of the first day&#x27;s journey, its monotony</p>
<p>occasionally relieved, though, by the passage of immense flocks of</p>
<p>ducks and geese, and the appearance at intervals of herds of deer,</p>
<p>and sometimes droves of wild cattle, wild horses and mules.  The</p>
<p>bands of wild horses I noticed were sometimes led by mules, but</p>
<p>generally by stallions with long wavy manes, and flowing tails which</p>
<p>almost touched the ground.</p>
<p>We arrived at Laredo during one of those severe storms incident to</p>
<p>that section, which are termed &quot;Northers&quot; from the fact that the</p>
<p>north winds culminate occasionally in cold windstorms, frequently</p>
<p>preceded by heavy rains.  Generally the blow lasts for three days,</p>
<p>and the cold becomes intense and piercing.  While the sudden</p>
<p>depression of the temperature is most disagreeable, and often causes</p>
<p>great suffering, it is claimed that these &quot;Northers&quot; make the climate</p>
<p>more healthy and endurable.  They occur from October to May, and in</p>
<p>addition to the destruction which, through the sudden depression of</p>
<p>the temperature, they bring on the herds in the interior, they are</p>
<p>often of sufficient violence to greatly injure the harbors on the</p>
<p>coast.</p>
<p>The post near Laredo was called Fort McIntosh, and at this period the</p>
<p>troops stationed there consisted of eight companies of the Fifth</p>
<p>Infantry and two of the First, one of the First Artillery, and three</p>
<p>of the Mounted Rifles.  Just before the &quot;Norther&quot; began these troops</p>
<p>had completed a redoubt for the defense of the post, with the</p>
<p>exception of the ditches, but as the parapet was built of sand--the</p>
<p>only material about Laredo which could be obtained for its</p>
<p>construction--the severity of the winds was too much for such a</p>
<p>shifting substance, and the work was entirely blown away early in the</p>
<p>storm.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly and hospitably welcomed by the officers at the post,</p>
<p>all of whom were living in tents, with no furniture except a cot and</p>
<p>trunk, and an improvised bed for a stranger, when one happened to</p>
<p>come along.  After I had been kindly taken in by one of the younger</p>
<p>officers, I reported to the commanding officer, and was informed by</p>
<p>him that he would direct the quartermaster to furnish me, as soon as</p>
<p>convenient, with transportation to Fort Duncan, the station of my</p>
<p>company.</p>
<p>In the course of a day or two, the quartermaster notified me that a</p>
<p>Government six-mule wagon would be placed at my disposal to proceed</p>
<p>to my destination.  No better means offering, I concluded to set out</p>
<p>in this conveyance, and, since it was also to carry a quantity of</p>
<p>quartermaster&#x27;s property for Fort Duncan, I managed to obtain room</p>
<p>enough for my bed in the limited space between the bows and load,</p>
<p>where I could rest tolerably well, and under cover at night, instead</p>
<p>of sleeping on the ground under the wagon, as I had done on the road</p>
<p>from Corpus Christi to Laredo.</p>
<p>I reached Fort Duncan in March, 1854., and was kindly received by the</p>
<p>commanding officer of the, regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson</p>
<p>Morris,and by the captain of my company (&quot;D&quot;), Eugene E. McLean, and</p>
<p>his charming wife the only daughter of General E. V. Sumner, who was</p>
<p>already distinguished in our service, but much better known in after</p>
<p>years in the operations ofthe Army of the Potomac, during its early</p>
<p>campaigns in Virginia.  Shortly after joining company &quot;D&quot; I was sent</p>
<p>out on scouting duty with another company of the regiment to Camp La</p>
<p>Pena, about sixty or seventy miles east of Fort Duncan, in a section</p>
<p>of country that had for some time past been subjected to raids by the</p>
<p>Lipan and Comanche Indians.  Ournoutpost at La Pena was intended as a</p>
<p>protection against the predatory incursions of these savages, so</p>
<p>almost constant scouting became a daily occupation.  This enabled me</p>
<p>soon to become familiar with and make maps of the surrounding</p>
<p>country, and, through constant association with our Mexican guide, to</p>
<p>pick up in a short time quite a smattering of the Spanish language,</p>
<p>which was very useful to one serving on that frontier.</p>
<p>At that early day western Texas was literally filled with game, and</p>
<p>the region in the immediate vicinity of La Pena contained its full</p>
<p>proportion of deer, antelope, and wild turkeys.  The temptation to</p>
<p>hunt was therefore constantly before me, and a desire to indulge in</p>
<p>this pastime, whenever free from the legitimate duty of the camp,</p>
<p>soon took complete possession of me, so expeditions in pursuit of</p>
<p>game were of frequent occurrence.  In these expeditions I was always</p>
<p>accompanied by a soldier named Frankman, belonging to &quot; D &quot; company,</p>
<p>who was a fine sportsman, and a butcher by trade.  In a short period</p>
<p>I learned from Frankman how to approach and secure the different</p>
<p>species of game, and also how to dress and care for it when killed.</p>
<p>Almost every expedition we made was rewarded with a good supply of</p>
<p>deer, antelope, and wild turkeys, and we furnished the command in</p>
<p>camp with such abundance that it was relieved from the necessity of</p>
<p>drawing its beef ration, much to the discomfiture of the disgruntled</p>
<p>beef contractor.</p>
<p>The camp at La Pena was on sandy ground, unpleasant for men and</p>
<p>animals, and by my advice it was moved to La Pendencia, not far from</p>
<p>Lake Espantosa.  Before removal from our old location, however, early</p>
<p>one bright morning Frankman and I started on one of our customary</p>
<p>expeditions, going down La Pena Creek to a small creek, at the head</p>
<p>of which we had established a hunting rendezvous.  After proceeding</p>
<p>along the stream for three or four miles we saw a column of smoke on</p>
<p>the prairie, and supposing it arose from a camp of Mexican rancheros</p>
<p>catching wild horses or wild cattle, and even wild mules, which were</p>
<p>very numerous in that section of country along the Nueces River, we</p>
<p>thought we would join the party and see how much success they were</p>
<p>having, and observe the methods employed in this laborious and</p>
<p>sometimes dangerous vocation.  With this object in view, we continued</p>
<p>on until we found it necessary to cross to the other side of the</p>
<p>creek to reach the point indicated by the smoke.  Just before</p>
<p>reaching the crossing I discovered moccasin tracks near the water&#x27;s</p>
<p>edge, and realizing in an instant that the camp we were approaching</p>
<p>might possibly be one of hostile Indians--all Indians in that country</p>
<p>at that time were hostile--Frankman and I backed out silently, and</p>
<p>made eager strides for La Pena, where we had scarcely arrived when</p>
<p>Captain M. E. Van Buren, of the Mounted Rifle regiment, came in with</p>
<p>a small command, and reported that he was out in pursuit of a band of</p>
<p>Comanche Indians, which had been committing depredations up about</p>
<p>Fort Clark, but that he had lost the trail.  I immediately informed</p>
<p>him of what had occurred to me during the morning, and that I could</p>
<p>put him on the trail of the Indians he was desirous of punishing.</p>
<p>We hurriedly supplied with rations his small command of thirteen,</p>
<p>men, and I then conducted him to the point where I had seen the</p>
<p>smoke, and there we found signs indicating it to be the recently</p>
<p>abandoned camp of the Indians he was pursuing, and we also noticed</p>
<p>that prairie rats had formed the principal article of diet at the</p>
<p>meal they had just completed.  As they had gone, I could do no more</p>
<p>than put him on the trail made in their departure, which was well</p>
<p>marked; for Indians, when in small parties, and unless pressed,</p>
<p>usually follow each other in single file.  Captain Van Buren followed</p>
<p>the trail by Fort Ewell, and well down toward Corpus Christi, day and</p>
<p>night, until the Indians, exhausted and used up, halted, on an open</p>
<p>plain, unsaddled their horses, mounted bareback, and offered battle.</p>
<p>Their number was double that of Van Buren&#x27;s detachment, but he</p>
<p>attacked them fearlessly, and in the fight was mortally wounded by an</p>
<p>arrow which entered his body in front, just above the sword belt, and</p>
<p>came through the belt behind.  The principal chief of the Indians was</p>
<p>killed, and the rest fled.  Captain Van Buren&#x27;s men carried him to</p>
<p>Corpus Christi, where in a few days he died.</p>
<p>After our removal to La Pendencia a similar pursuit of savages</p>
<p>occurred, but with more fortunate results.  Colonel John H. King, now</p>
<p>on the retired list, then a captain in the First Infantry, came to</p>
<p>our camp in pursuit of a marauding band of hostile Indians, and I was</p>
<p>enabled to put him also on the trail.  He soon overtook them, and</p>
<p>killing two without loss to himself, the band dispersed like a flock</p>
<p>of quail and left him nothing to follow.  He returned to our camp</p>
<p>shortly after, and the few friendly Indian scouts he had with him</p>
<p>held a grand pow-wow and dance over the scalps of the fallen braves.</p>
<p>Around La Pendencia, as at La Pena, the country abounded in deer,</p>
<p>antelope, wild turkeys, and quail, and we killed enough to supply</p>
<p>abundantly the whole command with the meat portion of the ration.</p>
<p>Some mornings Frankman and I would bring in as many as seven deer,</p>
<p>and our hunting expeditions made me so familiar with the region</p>
<p>between our camp arid Fort Duncan, the headquarters of the regiment,</p>
<p>that I was soon enabled to suggest a more direct route of</p>
<p>communication than the circuitous one then traversed, and in a short</p>
<p>time it was established.</p>
<p>Up to this time I had been on detached duty, but soon my own company</p>
<p>was ordered into the field to occupy a position on Turkey Creek,</p>
<p>about ten or twelve miles west of the Nueces River, on the road from</p>
<p>San Antonio to Fort Duncan, and I was required to join the company.</p>
<p>Here constant work and scouting were necessary, as our camp was</p>
<p>specially located with reference to protecting from Indian raids the</p>
<p>road running from San Antonio to Fort Duncan, and on to the interior</p>
<p>of Mexico.  In those days this road was the great line of travel, and</p>
<p>Mexican caravans were frequently passing over it, to and fro, in such</p>
<p>a disorganized condition as often to invite attack from marauding</p>
<p>Comanches and Lipans.  Our time, therefore, was incessantly occupied</p>
<p>in scouting, but our labors were much lightened because they were</p>
<p>directed with intelligence and justice by Captain McLean, whose</p>
<p>agreeable manners and upright methods are still so impressed on my</p>
<p>memory that to this day I look back upon my service with &quot;D&quot; Company</p>
<p>of the First Infantry as among those events which I remember with</p>
<p>most pleasure.</p>
<p>In this manner my first summer of active field duty passed rapidly</p>
<p>away, and in the fall my company returned to Fort Duncan to go into</p>
<p>winter quarters.  These quarters, when constructed, consisted of &quot;A&quot;</p>
<p>tents pitched under a shed improvised by the company.  With only</p>
<p>these accommodations I at first lived around as best I could until</p>
<p>the command was quartered, and then, requesting a detail of wagons</p>
<p>from the quartermaster, I went out some thirty miles to get poles to</p>
<p>build a more comfortable habitation for myself.  In a few days enough</p>
<p>poles for the construction of a modest residence were secured and</p>
<p>brought in, and then the building of my house began.  First, the</p>
<p>poles were cut the proper length, planted in a trench around four</p>
<p>sides of a square of very small proportions, and secured at the top</p>
<p>by string-pieces stretched from one angle to another, in which</p>
<p>half-notches hack been made at proper intervals to receive the</p>
<p>uprights.  The poles were then made rigid by strips nailed on</p>
<p>half-way to the ground, giving the sides of the structure firmness,</p>
<p>but the interstices were large and frequent; still, with the aid of</p>
<p>some old condemned paulins obtained from the quartermaster, the walls</p>
<p>were covered and the necessity for chinking obviated.  This method of</p>
<p>covering the holes in the side walls also possessed the advantage of</p>
<p>permitting some little light to penetrate to the interior of the</p>
<p>house, and avoided the necessity of constructing a window, for which,</p>
<p>by the way, no glass could have been obtained.  Next a good large</p>
<p>fire-place and chimney were built in one corner by means of stones</p>
<p>and mud, and then the roof was put on--a thatched one of prairie</p>
<p>grass.  The floor was dirt compactly tamped.</p>
<p>My furniture was very primitive: a chair or two, with about the same</p>
<p>number of camp stools, a cot, and a rickety old bureau that I</p>
<p>obtained in some way not now remembered.  My washstand consisted of a</p>
<p>board about three feet long, resting on legs formed by driving sticks</p>
<p>into the ground until they held it at about the proper height from</p>
<p>the floor.  This washstand was the most expensive piece of furniture</p>
<p>I owned, the board having cost me three dollars, and even then I</p>
<p>obtained it as a favor, for lumber on the Rio Grande was so scarce in</p>
<p>those days that to possess even the smallest quantity was to indulge</p>
<p>in great luxury.  Indeed, about all that reached the post was what</p>
<p>came in the shape of bacon boxes, and the boards from these were</p>
<p>reserved for coffins in which to bury our dead.</p>
<p>In this rude habitation I spent a happy winter, and was more</p>
<p>comfortably off than many of the officers, who had built none, but</p>
<p>lived in tents and took the chances of &quot;Northers.&quot; During this period</p>
<p>our food was principally the soldier&#x27;s ration: flour, pickled pork,</p>
<p>nasty bacon--cured in the dust of ground charcoal--and fresh beef, of</p>
<p>which we had a plentiful supply, supplemented with game of various</p>
<p>kinds.  The sugar, coffee, and smaller parts of the ration were good,</p>
<p>but we had no vegetables, and the few jars of preserves and some few</p>
<p>vegetables kept by the sutler were too expensive to be indulged in.</p>
<p>So during all the period I lived at Fort Duncan and its sub-camps,</p>
<p>nearly sixteen months, fresh vegetables were practically</p>
<p>unobtainable.  To prevent scurvy we used the juice of the maguey</p>
<p>plant, called pulque, and to obtain a supply of this anti-scorbutic I</p>
<p>was often detailed to march the company out about forty miles, cut</p>
<p>the plant, load up two or three wagons with the stalks, and carry</p>
<p>them to camp.  Here the juice was extracted by a rude press, and put</p>
<p>in bottles until it fermented and became worse in odor than</p>
<p>sulphureted hydrogen.  At reveille roll-call every morning this</p>
<p>fermented liquor was dealt out to the company, and as it was my duty,</p>
<p>in my capacity of subaltern, to attend these roll-calls and see that</p>
<p>the men took their ration of pulque, I always began the duty by</p>
<p>drinking a cup of the repulsive stuff myself.  Though hard to</p>
<p>swallow, its well-known specific qualities in the prevention and cure</p>
<p>of scurvy were familiar to all, so every man in the command gulped</p>
<p>down his share notwithstanding its vile taste and odor.</p>
<p>Considering our isolation, the winter passed very pleasantly to us</p>
<p>all.  The post was a large one, its officers congenial, and we had</p>
<p>many enjoyable occasions.  Dances, races, and horseback riding filled</p>
<p>in much of the time, and occasional raids from Indians furnished more</p>
<p>serious occupation in the way of a scout now and then.  The proximity</p>
<p>of the Indians at times rendered the surrounding country somewhat</p>
<p>dangerous for individuals or small parties at a distance from the</p>
<p>fort; but few thought the savages would come near, so many risks were</p>
<p>doubtless run by various officers, who carried the familiar</p>
<p>six-shooter as their only weapon while out horseback riding, until</p>
<p>suddenly we were awakened to the dangers we had been incurring.</p>
<p>About mid-winter a party of hostile Lipans made a swoop around and</p>
<p>skirting the garrison, killing a herder--a discharged drummer-boy--in</p>
<p>sight of the flag-staff.  Of course great excitement followed.</p>
<p>Captain J. G. Walker, of the Mounted Rifles, immediately started with</p>
<p>his company in pursuit of the Indians, and I was directed to</p>
<p>accompany the command.  Not far away we found the body of the boy</p>
<p>filled with arrows, and near him the body of a fine looking young</p>
<p>Indian, whom the lad had undoubtedly killed before he was himself</p>
<p>overpowered.  We were not a great distance behind the Indians when</p>
<p>the boy&#x27;s body was discovered, and having good trailers we gained on</p>
<p>them rapidly, with the prospect of overhauling them, but as soon as</p>
<p>they found we were getting near they headed for the Rio Grande, made</p>
<p>the crossing to the opposite bank, and were in Mexico before we could</p>
<p>overtake them.  When on the other side of the boundary they grew very</p>
<p>brave, daring us to come over to fight them, well aware all the time</p>
<p>that the international line prevented us from continuing the pursuit.</p>
<p>So we had to return to the post without reward for our exertion</p>
<p>except the consciousness of having made the best effort we could to</p>
<p>catch the murderers.  That night, in company with Lieutenant Thomas</p>
<p>G. Williams, I crossed over the river to the Mexican village of</p>
<p>Piedras Negras, and on going to a house where a large baille, or</p>
<p>dance, was going on we found among those present two of the Indians</p>
<p>we had been chasing.  As soon as they saw us they strung their bows</p>
<p>for a fight, and we drew our sixshooters, but the Mexicans quickly</p>
<p>closed in around the Indians and forced them out of the house--or</p>
<p>rude jackal--where the &quot;ball&quot; was being held, and they escaped.  We</p>
<p>learned later something about the nature of the fight the drummer had</p>
<p>made, and that his death had cost them dear, for, in addition to the</p>
<p>Indian killed and lying by his side, he had mortally wounded another</p>
<p>and seriously wounded a third, with the three shots that he had</p>
<p>fired.</p>
<p>At this period I took up the notion of making a study of ornithology,</p>
<p>incited to it possibly by the great number of bright-colored birds</p>
<p>that made their winter homes along the Rio Grande, and I spent many a</p>
<p>leisure hour in catching specimens by means of stick traps, with</p>
<p>which I found little difficulty in securing almost every variety of</p>
<p>the feathered tribes.  I made my traps by placing four sticks of a</p>
<p>length suited to the size desired so as to form a square, and</p>
<p>building up on them in log-cabin fashion until the structure came</p>
<p>almost to a point by contraction of the corners.  Then the sticks .</p>
<p>were made secure, the trap placed at some secluded spot, and from the</p>
<p>centre to the outside a trench was dug in the ground, and thinly</p>
<p>covered when a depth had been obtained that would leave an aperture</p>
<p>sufficiently large to admit the class of birds desired.  Along this</p>
<p>trench seeds and other food were scattered, which the birds soon</p>
<p>discovered, and of course began to eat, unsuspectingly following the</p>
<p>tempting bait through the gallery till they emerged from its farther</p>
<p>end in the centre of the trap, where they contentedly fed till the</p>
<p>food was all gone.  Then the fact of imprisonment first presented</p>
<p>itself, and they vainly endeavored to escape through the interstices</p>
<p>of the cage, never once guided by their instinct to return to liberty</p>
<p>through the route by which they had entered.</p>
<p>Among the different kinds of birds captured in this way, mocking-</p>
<p>birds, blue-birds, robins, meadow larks, quail, and plover were the</p>
<p>most numerous.  They seemed to have more voracious appetites than</p>
<p>other varieties, or else they were more unwary, and consequently more</p>
<p>easily caught.  A change of station, however, put an end to my</p>
<p>ornithological plans, and activities of other kinds prevented me from</p>
<p>resuming them in after life.</p>
<p>There were quite a number of young officers at the post during the</p>
<p>winter, and as our relations with the Mexican commandant at Piedras</p>
<p>Negras were most amicable, we were often invited to dances at his</p>
<p>house.  He and his hospitable wife and daughter drummed up the female</p>
<p>portion of the elite of Piedras Negras and provided the house, which</p>
<p>was the official as well as the personal residence of the commandant,</p>
<p>while we--the young officers--furnished the music and such</p>
<p>sweetmeats, candies, &amp;c., for the baille as the country would afford.</p>
<p>We generally danced in a long hall on a hard dirt floor.  The girls</p>
<p>sat on one side of the hall, chaperoned by their mothers or some old</p>
<p>duennas, and the men on the other.  When the music struck up each man</p>
<p>asked the lady whom his eyes had already selected to dance with him,</p>
<p>and it was not etiquette for her to refuse--no engagements being</p>
<p>allowed before the music began.  When the dance, which was generally</p>
<p>a long waltz, was over, he seated his partner, and then went to a</p>
<p>little counter at the end of the room and bought his dulcinea a plate</p>
<p>of the candies and sweetmeats provided.  Sometimes she accepted them,</p>
<p>but most generally pointed to her duenna or chaperon behind, who held</p>
<p>up her apron and caught the refreshments as they were slid into it</p>
<p>from the plate.  The greatest decorum was maintained at these dances,</p>
<p>primitively as they were conducted; and in a region so completely cut</p>
<p>off from the world, their influence was undoubtedly beneficial to a</p>
<p>considerable degree in softening the rough edges in a half-breed</p>
<p>population.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this frontier of Mexico were strongly marked with</p>
<p>Indian characteristics, particularly with those of the Comanche type,</p>
<p>and as the wild Indian blood predominated, few of the physical traits</p>
<p>of the Spaniard remained among them, and outlawry was common.  The</p>
<p>Spanish conquerors had left on the northern border only their</p>
<p>graceful manners and their humility before the cross.  The sign of</p>
<p>Christianity was prominently placed at all important points on roads</p>
<p>or trails, and especially where any one had been killed; and as the</p>
<p>Comanche Indians, strong and warlike, had devastated northeastern</p>
<p>Mexico in past years, all along the border, on both sides of the Rio</p>
<p>Grande, the murderous effects of their raids were evidenced by</p>
<p>numberless crosses.  For more than a century forays had been made on</p>
<p>the settlements and towns by these bloodthirsty savages, and, the</p>
<p>Mexican Government being too weak to afford protection, property was</p>
<p>destroyed, the women and children carried off or ravished, and the</p>
<p>men compelled to look on in an agony of helplessness till relieved by</p>
<p>death.  During all this time, however, the forms and ceremonials of</p>
<p>religion, and the polite manners received from the Spaniards, were</p>
<p>retained, and reverence for the emblems of Christianity was always</p>
<p>uppermost in the mind of even the most ignorant.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<p>ORDERED TO FORT READING, CAL.--A DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING--A RESCUED</p>
<p>SOLDIER--DISCOVERING INDIANS--PRIMITIVE FISHING--A DESERTED</p>
<p>VILLAGE--CAMPING OPPOSITE FORT VANCOUVER.</p>
<p>In November, 1854, I received my promotion to a second lieutenancy in</p>
<p>the Fourth Infantry, which was stationed in California and Oregon. In</p>
<p>order to join my company at Fort Reading, California, I had to go to</p>
<p>New York as a starting point, and on arrival there, was placed on</p>
<p>duty, in May, 1855, in command of a detachment of recruits at</p>
<p>Bedloe&#x27;s Island, intended for assignment to the regiments on the</p>
<p>Pacific coast.  I think there were on the island (now occupied by the</p>
<p>statue of Liberty Enlightening the World) about three hundred</p>
<p>recruits.  For a time I was the only officer with them, but shortly</p>
<p>before we started for California, Lieutenant Francis H. Bates, of the</p>
<p>Fourth Infantry, was placed in command. We embarked for the Pacific</p>
<p>coast in July, 1855, and made the journey without incident via the</p>
<p>Isthmus of Panama, in due time landing our men at Benecia Barracks,</p>
<p>above San Francisco.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From this point I proceeded to join my company at Fort Reading, and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on reaching that post, found orders directing me to relieve</p>
<p>Lieutenant John B. Hood--afterward well known as a distinguished</p>
<p>general in the Confederate service.  Lieutenant Hood was in command</p>
<p>of the personal mounted escort of Lieutenant R. S. Williamson, who</p>
<p>was charged with the duty of making such explorations and surveys as</p>
<p>would determine the practicability of connecting, by railroad, the</p>
<p>Sacramento Valley in California with the Columbia River in Oregon</p>
<p>Territory, either through the Willamette Valley, or (if this route</p>
<p>should prove to be impracticable) by the valley of the Des Chutes</p>
<p>River near the foot-slopes of the Cascade chain.  The survey was</p>
<p>being made in accordance with an act of Congress, which provided both</p>
<p>for ascertaining the must practicable and economical route for a</p>
<p>railroad between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean, and for</p>
<p>military and geographical surveys west of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Fort Reading was the starting-point for this exploring expedition,</p>
<p>and there I arrived some four or five days after the party under</p>
<p>Lieutenant Williamson had begun its march.  His personal escort</p>
<p>numbered about sixty mounted men, made up of detachments from</p>
<p>companies of the First Dragoons, under command of Lieutenant Hood,</p>
<p>together with about one hundred men belonging to the Fourth Infantry</p>
<p>arid Third Artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Horatio Gates Gibson,</p>
<p>the present colonel of the Third United States Artillery.  Lieutenant</p>
<p>George Crook--now major-general--was the quartermaster and commissary</p>
<p>of subsistence of the expedition.</p>
<p>The commanding officer at Fort Reading seemed reluctant to let me go</p>
<p>on to relieve Lieutenant Hood, as the country to be passed over was</p>
<p>infested by the Pit River Indians, known to be hostile to white</p>
<p>people and especially to small parties.  I was very anxious to</p>
<p>proceed, however, and willing to take the chances; so, consent being</p>
<p>finally obtained, I started with a corporal and two mounted men,</p>
<p>through a wild and uninhabited region, to overtake if possible</p>
<p>Lieutenant Williamson.  Being on horseback, and unencumbered by</p>
<p>luggage of any kind except blankets and a little hard bread, coffee</p>
<p>and smoking-tobacco, which were all carried on our riding animals, we</p>
<p>were sanguine of succeeding, for we traversed in one day fully the</p>
<p>distance made in three by Lieutenant Williamson&#x27;s party on foot.</p>
<p>The first day we reached the base of Lassan&#x27;s Butte, where I</p>
<p>determined to spend the night near an isolated cabin, or dugout, that</p>
<p>had been recently constructed by a hardy pioneer.  The wind was</p>
<p>blowing a disagreeable gale, which had begun early in the day.  This</p>
<p>made it desirable to locate our camp under the best cover we could</p>
<p>find, and I spent some little time in looking about for a</p>
<p>satisfactory place, but nothing better offered than a large fallen</p>
<p>tree, which lay in such a direction that by encamping on its lee side</p>
<p>we would be protected from the fury of the storm.  This spot was</p>
<p>therefore fixed upon, and preparation made for spending the night as</p>
<p>comfortably as the circumstances would permit.</p>
<p>After we had unsaddled I visited the cabin to inquire in regard to</p>
<p>the country ahead, and there found at first only a soldier of</p>
<p>Williamson&#x27;s party; later the proprietor of the ranch appeared.  The</p>
<p>soldier had been left behind by the surveying party on account of</p>
<p>illness, with instructions to make his way back to Fort Reading as</p>
<p>best he could when he recovered.  His condition having greatly</p>
<p>improved, however, since he had been left, he now begged me in</p>
<p>beseeching terms to take him along with my party, which I finally</p>
<p>consented to do, provided that if he became unable to keep up with</p>
<p>me, and I should be obliged to abandon him, the responsibility would</p>
<p>be his, not mine.  This increased my number to five, and was quite a</p>
<p>reinforcement should we run across any hostile Indians; but it was</p>
<p>also certain to prove an embarrassment should the man again fall ill.</p>
<p>During the night, notwithstanding the continuance of the storm, I had</p>
<p>a very sound and refreshing sleep behind the protecting log where we</p>
<p>made our camp, and at daylight next morning we resumed our journey,</p>
<p>fortified by a breakfast of coffee and hard bread.  I skirted around</p>
<p>the base of Lassan&#x27;s Butte, thence down Hat Creek, all the time</p>
<p>following the trail made by Lieutenant Williamson&#x27;s party.  About</p>
<p>noon the soldier I had picked up at my first camp gave out, and could</p>
<p>go no farther.  As stipulated when I consented to take him along, I</p>
<p>had the right to abandon him, but when it came to the test I could</p>
<p>not make up my mind to do it.  Finding a good place not far off the</p>
<p>trail, one of my men volunteered to remain with him until he died;</p>
<p>and we left them there, with a liberal supply of hard bread and</p>
<p>coffee, believing that we would never again see the invalid.  My</p>
<p>reinforcement was already gone, and another man with it.</p>
<p>With my diminished party I resumed the trail and followed it until</p>
<p>about 4 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, when we heard the sound of voices,</p>
<p>and the corporal, thinking we were approaching Lieutenant</p>
<p>Williamson&#x27;s party, was so overjoyed in anticipation of the junction,</p>
<p>that he wanted to fire his musket as an expression of his delight.</p>
<p>This I prevented his doing, however, and we continued cautiously and</p>
<p>slowly on to develop the source of the sounds in front.  We had not</p>
<p>gone far before I discovered that the noise came from a band of Pit</p>
<p>River Indians, who had struck the trail of the surveying expedition,</p>
<p>and were following it up, doubtless with evil intent.  Dismounting</p>
<p>from my horse I counted the moccasin tracks to ascertain the number</p>
<p>of Indians, discovered it to be about thirty, and then followed on</p>
<p>behind them cautiously, but with little difficulty, as appearances of</p>
<p>speed on their part indicated that they wished to overtake Lieutenant</p>
<p>Williamson&#x27;s party, which made them less on the lookout than usual</p>
<p>for any possible pursuers.  After following the trail until nearly</p>
<p>sundown, I considered it prudent to stop for the night, and drew off</p>
<p>some little distance, where, concealed in a dense growth of timber,</p>
<p>we made our camp.</p>
<p>As I had with me now only two men, I felt somewhat nervous, so I</p>
<p>allowed no fires to be built, and in consequence our supper consisted</p>
<p>of hard bread only.  I passed an anxious night, but beyond our own</p>
<p>solicitude there was nothing to disturb us, the Indians being too</p>
<p>much interested in overtaking the party in front to seek for victims</p>
<p>in the rear, After a hard-bread breakfast we started again on the</p>
<p>trail, and had proceeded but a short distance when, hearing the</p>
<p>voices of the Indians, we at once slackened our speed so as not to</p>
<p>overtake them.</p>
<p>Most of the trail on which we traveled during the morning ran over an</p>
<p>exceedingly rough lava formation--a spur of the lava beds often</p>
<p>described during the Modoc war of 1873 so hard and flinty that</p>
<p>Williamson&#x27;s large command made little impression on its surface,</p>
<p>leaving in fact, only indistinct traces of its line of march.  By</p>
<p>care and frequent examinations we managed to follow his route through</p>
<p>without much delay, or discovery by the Indians, and about noon,</p>
<p>owing to the termination of the lava formation, we descended into the</p>
<p>valley of Hat Greek, a little below where it emerges from the second</p>
<p>canon and above its confluence with Pit River.  As soon as we reached</p>
<p>the fertile soil of the valley, we found Williamson&#x27;s trail well</p>
<p>defined, deeply impressed in the soft loam, and coursing through</p>
<p>wild-flowers and luxuriant grass which carpeted the ground on every</p>
<p>hand.</p>
<p>When we struck this delightful locality we traveled with considerable</p>
<p>speed, and after passing over hill and vale for some distance, the</p>
<p>trail becoming more and more distinct all the time, I suddenly saw in</p>
<p>front of me the Pit River Indians.</p>
<p>This caused a halt, and having hurriedly re-capped our guns and</p>
<p>six-shooters, thus preparing for the worst, I took a look at the band</p>
<p>through my field-glass.  They were a half-mile or more in our front</p>
<p>and numbered about thirty individuals, armed with bows and arrows</p>
<p>only.  Observing us they made friendly demonstrations, but I had not</p>
<p>implicit faith in a Pit River Indian at that period of the settlement</p>
<p>of our country, and especially in that wild locality, so after a</p>
<p>&quot;council of war&quot; with the corporal and man, I concluded to advance to</p>
<p>a point about two hundred yards distant from the party, when, relying</p>
<p>on the speed of our horses rather than on the peaceable intentions of</p>
<p>the savages, I hoped to succeed in cutting around them and take the</p>
<p>trail beyond.  Being on foot they could not readily catch us, and</p>
<p>inasmuch as their arrows were good for a range of only about sixty</p>
<p>yards, I had no fear of any material damage on that score.</p>
<p>On reaching the place selected for our flank movement we made a dash</p>
<p>to the left of the trail, through the widest part of the valley, and</p>
<p>ran our horses swiftly by, but I noticed that the Indians did not</p>
<p>seem to be disturbed by the manoeuvre and soon realized that this</p>
<p>indifference was occasioned by the knowledge that we could not cross</p>
<p>Hat Creek, a deep stream with vertical banks, too broad to be leaped</p>
<p>by our horses.  We were obliged, therefore, to halt, and the Indians</p>
<p>again made demonstrations of friendship, some of them even getting</p>
<p>into the stream to show that they were at the ford.  Thus reassured,</p>
<p>we regained our confidence and boldly crossed the river in the midst</p>
<p>of them.  After we had gained the bluff on the other side of the</p>
<p>creek, I looked down into the valley of Pit River, and could plainly</p>
<p>see the camp of the surveying party.  Its proximity was the influence</p>
<p>which had doubtless caused the peaceable conduct of the Indians.</p>
<p>Probably the only thing that saved us was their ignorance of our</p>
<p>being in their rear, until we stumbled on them almost within sight of</p>
<p>the large party under Williamson.</p>
<p>The Pit River Indians were very hostile at that time, and for many</p>
<p>succeeding years their treachery and cruelty brought misfortune and</p>
<p>misery to the white settlers who ventured their lives in search of</p>
<p>home and fortune in the wild and isolated section over which these</p>
<p>savages roamed.  Not long after Williamson&#x27;s party passed through</p>
<p>their country, the Government was compelled to send into it a</p>
<p>considerable force for the purpose of keeping them under control.</p>
<p>The outcome of this was a severe fight--resulting in the loss of a</p>
<p>good many lives--between the hostiles and a party of our troops under</p>
<p>Lieutenant George Crook.  It finally ended in the establishment of a</p>
<p>military post in the vicinity of the battle-ground, for the permanent</p>
<p>occupation of the country.</p>
<p>A great load was lifted from my heart when I found myself so near</p>
<p>Williamson&#x27;s camp, which I joined August 4, 1855, receiving a warm</p>
<p>welcome from the officers.  During the afternoon I relieved</p>
<p>Lieutenant Hood of the command of the personal escort, and he was</p>
<p>ordered to return, with twelve of the mounted men, over the trail I</p>
<p>had followed.  I pointed out to him on the map the spot where he</p>
<p>would find the two men left on the roadside, and he was directed to</p>
<p>take them into Fort Reading.  They were found without difficulty, and</p>
<p>carried in to the post.  The sick man--Duryea--whom I had expected</p>
<p>never to see again, afterward became the hospital steward at Fort</p>
<p>Yamhill, Oregon, when I was stationed there.</p>
<p>The Indians that I had passed at the ford came to the bluff above the</p>
<p>camp, and arranging themselves in a squatting posture, looked down</p>
<p>upon Williamson&#x27;s party with longing eyes, in expectation of a feast.</p>
<p>They were a pitiable lot, almost naked, hungry and cadaverous.</p>
<p>Indians are always hungry, but these poor creatures were particularly</p>
<p>so, as their usual supply of food had grown very scarce from one</p>
<p>cause and another.</p>
<p>In prosperity they mainly subsisted on fish, or game killed with the</p>
<p>bow and arrow.  When these sources failed they lived on grasshoppers,</p>
<p>and at this season the grasshopper was their principal food.  In</p>
<p>former years salmon were very abundant in the streams of the</p>
<p>Sacramento Valley, and every fall they took great quantities of these</p>
<p>fish and dried them for winter use, but alluvial mining had of late</p>
<p>years defiled the water of the different streams and driven the fish</p>
<p>out.  On this account the usual supply of salmon was very limited.</p>
<p>They got some trout high up on the rivers, above the sluices and</p>
<p>rockers of the miners, but this was a precarious source from which to</p>
<p>derive food, as their means of taking the trout were very primitive.</p>
<p>They had neither hooks nor lines, but depended entirely on a</p>
<p>contrivance made from long, slender branches of willow, which grew on</p>
<p>the banks of most of the streams.  One of these branches would be</p>
<p>cut, and after sharpening the butt-end to a point, split a certain</p>
<p>distance, and by a wedge the prongs divided sufficiently to admit a</p>
<p>fish between.  The Indian fisherman would then slyly put the forked</p>
<p>end in the water over his intended victim, and with a quick dart</p>
<p>firmly wedge him between the prongs.  When secured there, the work of</p>
<p>landing him took but a moment.  When trout were plentiful this</p>
<p>primitive mode of taking them was quite successful, and I have often</p>
<p>known hundreds of pounds to be caught in this way, but when they were</p>
<p>scarce and suspicious the rude method was not rewarded with good</p>
<p>results.</p>
<p>The band looking down on us evidently had not had much fish or game</p>
<p>to eat for some time, so when they had made Williamson understand</p>
<p>that they were suffering for food he permitted them to come into</p>
<p>camp, and furnished them with a supply, which they greedily swallowed</p>
<p>as fast as it was placed at their service, regardless of possible</p>
<p>indigestion.  When they had eaten all they could hold, their</p>
<p>enjoyment was made complete by the soldiers, who gave them a quantity</p>
<p>of strong plug tobacco.  This they smoked incessantly, inhaling all</p>
<p>the smoke, so that none of the effect should be lost.  When we</p>
<p>abandoned this camp the next day, the miserable wretches remained in</p>
<p>it and collected the offal about the cooks&#x27; fires to feast still</p>
<p>more, piecing out the meal, no doubt, with their staple article of</p>
<p>food--grasshoppers.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 5 Lieutenant Hood started back to Fort</p>
<p>Reading, and Lieutenant Williamson resumed his march for the Columbia</p>
<p>River.  Our course was up Pit River, by the lower and upper canons,</p>
<p>then across to the Klamath Lakes, then east, along their edge to the</p>
<p>upper lake.  At the middle Klamath Lake, just after crossing Lost</p>
<p>River and the Natural Bridge, we met a small party of citizens from</p>
<p>Jacksonville, Oregon, looking for hostile Indians who had committed</p>
<p>some depredations in their neighborhood.  From them we learned that</p>
<p>the Rogue River Indians in southern Oregon were on the war-path, and</p>
<p>that as the &quot;regular troops up there were of no account, the citizens</p>
<p>had taken matters in hand, and intended cleaning up the hostiles.&quot;</p>
<p>They swaggered about our camp, bragged a good deal, cursed the</p>
<p>Indians loudly, and soundly abused the Government for not giving them</p>
<p>better protection.  It struck me, however, that they had not worked</p>
<p>very hard to find the hostiles; indeed, it could plainly be seen that</p>
<p>their expedition was a town-meeting sort of affair, and that anxiety</p>
<p>to get safe home was uppermost in their thoughts.  The enthusiasm</p>
<p>with which they started had all oozed out, and that night they</p>
<p>marched back to Jacksonville.  The next day, at the head of the lake,</p>
<p>we came across an Indian village, and I have often wondered since</p>
<p>what would have been the course pursued by these valiant warriors</p>
<p>from Jacksonville had they gone far enough to get into its vicinity.</p>
<p>When we reached the village the tepees--made of grass--were all</p>
<p>standing, the fires burning and pots boiling--the pots filled with</p>
<p>camas and tula roots--but not an Indian was to be seen.  Williamson</p>
<p>directed that nothing in the village should be disturbed; so guards</p>
<p>were placed over it to carry out his instructions and we went into</p>
<p>camp just a little beyond.  We had scarcely established ourselves</p>
<p>when a very old Indian rose up from the high grass some distance off,</p>
<p>and with peaceable signs approached our camp, evidently for the</p>
<p>purpose of learning whether or not our intentions were hostile.</p>
<p>Williamson told him we were friendly; that we had passed through his</p>
<p>village without molesting it, that we had put a guard there to secure</p>
<p>the property his people had abandoned in their fright, and that they</p>
<p>might come back in safety.  The old man searchingly eyed everything</p>
<p>around for some little time, and gaining confidence from the</p>
<p>peaceable appearance of the men, who were engaged in putting up the</p>
<p>tents and preparing their evening meal, he concluded to accept our</p>
<p>professions of friendship, and bring his people in.  Going out about</p>
<p>half a mile from the village he gave a peculiar yell, at which</p>
<p>between three and four hundred Indians arose simultaneously from the</p>
<p>ground, and in answer to his signal came out of the tall grass like a</p>
<p>swarm of locusts and soon overran our camp in search of food, for</p>
<p>like all Indians they were hungry.  They too, proved to be Pit</p>
<p>Rivers, and were not less repulsive than those of their tribe we had</p>
<p>met before.  They were aware of the hostilities going on between the</p>
<p>Rogue Rivers and the whites, but claimed that they had not taken any</p>
<p>part in them.  I question if they had, but had our party been small,</p>
<p>I fear we should have been received at their village in a very</p>
<p>different manner.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the upper Klamath Lake we marched over the divide and down the</p>
</blockquote>
<p>valley of the Des Chutes River to a point opposite the mountains</p>
<p>called the Three Sisters.  Here, on September 23, the party divided,</p>
<p>Williamson and I crossing through the crater of the Three Sisters and</p>
<p>along the western slope of the Cascade Range, until we struck the</p>
<p>trail on McKenzie River, which led us into the Willamette Valley not</p>
<p>far from Eugene City.  We then marched down the Willamette Valley to</p>
<p>Portland, Oregon, where we arrived October 9, 1855</p>
<p>The infantry portion of the command, escorting Lieutenant Henry L.</p>
<p>Abbot, followed farther down the Des Chutes River, to a point</p>
<p>opposite Mount Hood, from which it came into the Willamette Valley</p>
<p>and then marched to Portland.  At Portland we all united, and moving</p>
<p>across the point between the Willamette and Columbia rivers, encamped</p>
<p>opposite Fort Vancouver, on the south bank of the latter stream, on</p>
<p>the farm of an old settler named Switzler, who had located there many</p>
<p>years before.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>&quot;OLD RED&quot;--SKILLFUL SHOOTING--YAKIMA--WAR--A LUDICROUS MISTAKE--</p>
<p>&quot;CUT-MOUTH JOHN&#x27;S&quot; ENCOUNTER--FATHER PANDOZA&#x27;S MISSION--A SNOW-STORM-</p>
<p>-FAILURE OF THE EXPEDITION.</p>
<p>Our camp on the Columbia, near Fort Vancouver, was beautifully</p>
<p>situated on a grassy sward close to the great river; and--as little</p>
<p>duty was required of us after so long a journey, amusement of one</p>
<p>kind or another, and an interchange of visits with the officers at</p>
<p>the post, filled in the time acceptably.  We had in camp an old</p>
<p>mountaineer guide who had accompanied us on the recent march, and who</p>
<p>had received the sobriquet of &quot;Old Red,&quot; on account of the shocky and</p>
<p>tangled mass of red hair and beard, which covered his head and face</p>
<p>so completely that only his eyes could be seen.  His eccentricities</p>
<p>constantly supplied us with a variety of amusements.  Among the</p>
<p>pastimes he indulged in was one which exhibited his skill with the</p>
<p>rifle, and at the same time protected the camp from the intrusions</p>
<p>and ravages of a drove of razor-backed hogs which belonged to Mr.</p>
<p>Switzler.  These hogs were frequent visitors, and very destructive to</p>
<p>our grassy sward, rooting it up in front of our tents and all about</p>
<p>us; in pursuit of bulbous roots and offal from the camp.  Old Red</p>
<p>conceived the idea that it would be well to disable the pigs by</p>
<p>shooting off the tips of their snouts, and he proceeded to put his</p>
<p>conception into execution, and continued it daily whenever the hogs</p>
<p>made their appearance.  Of course their owner made a row about it;</p>
<p>but when Old Red daily settled for his fun by paying liberally with</p>
<p>gold-dust from some small bottles of the precious metal in his</p>
<p>possession, Switzler readily became contented, and I think even</p>
<p>encouraged the exhibitions--of skill.</p>
<p>It was at this period (October, 1855) that the Yakima Indian war</p>
<p>broke out, and I was detached from duty with the exploring party and</p>
<p>required by Major Gabriel J. Rains, then commanding the district, to</p>
<p>join an expedition against the Yakimas.  They had some time before</p>
<p>killed their agent, and in consequence a force under Major Granville</p>
<p>O. Haller had been sent out from the Dalles of the Columbia to</p>
<p>chastise them; but the expedition had not been successful; in fact,</p>
<p>it had been driven back, losing a number of men and two mountain</p>
<p>howitzers.</p>
<p>The object of the second expedition was to retrieve this disaster.</p>
<p>The force was composed of a small body of regular troops, and a</p>
<p>regiment of Oregon mounted volunteers under command of Colonel James</p>
<p>W. Nesmith--subsequently for several years United States Senator from</p>
<p>Oregon.  The whole force was under the command of Major Rains, Fourth</p>
<p>Infantry, who, in order that he might rank Nesmith, by some</p>
<p>hocus-pocus had been made a brigadier-general, under an appointment</p>
<p>from the Governor of Washington Territory.</p>
<p>We started from the Dalles October 30, under conditions that were not</p>
<p>conducive to success.  The season was late for operations; and worse</p>
<p>still, the command was not in accord with the commanding officer,</p>
<p>because of general belief in his incompetency, and on account of the</p>
<p>fictitious rank he assumed.  On the second day out I struck a small</p>
<p>body of Indians with my detachment of dragoons, but was unable to do</p>
<p>them any particular injury beyond getting possession of a large</p>
<p>quantity of their winter food, which their hurried departure</p>
<p>compelled them to abandon.  This food consisted principally of dried</p>
<p>salmon-pulverized and packed in sacks made of grass-dried</p>
<p>huckleberries, and dried camas; the latter a bulbous root about the</p>
<p>size of a small onion, which, when roasted and ground, is made into</p>
<p>bread by the Indians and has a taste somewhat like cooked chestnuts.</p>
<p>Our objective point was Father Pandoza&#x27;s Mission, in the Yakima</p>
<p>Valley, which could be reached by two different routes, and though</p>
<p>celerity of movement was essential, our commanding officer</p>
<p>&quot;strategically&quot; adopted the longer route, and thus the Indians had</p>
<p>ample opportunity to get away with their horses, cattle, women and</p>
<p>children, and camp property.</p>
<p>After the encounter which I just now referred to, the command, which</p>
<p>had halted to learn the results of my chase, resumed its march to and</p>
<p>through the Klikitat canon, and into the lower Yakima Valley, in the</p>
<p>direction of the Yakima River.  I had charge at the head of the</p>
<p>column as it passed through the canon, and on entering the valley</p>
<p>beyond, saw in the distance five or six Indian scouts, whom I pressed</p>
<p>very closely, until after a run of several miles they escaped across</p>
<p>the Yakima River.</p>
<p>The soil in the valley was light and dry, and the movement of animals</p>
<p>over it raised great clouds of dust, that rendered it very difficult</p>
<p>to distinguish friend from foe; and as I was now separated from the</p>
<p>main column a considerable distance, I deemed it prudent to call a</p>
<p>halt until we could discover the direction taken by the principal</p>
<p>body of the Indians.  We soon learned that they had gone up the</p>
<p>valley, and looking that way, we discovered a column of alkali dust</p>
<p>approaching us, about a mile distant, interposing between my little</p>
<p>detachment and the point where I knew General Rains intended to</p>
<p>encamp for the night.  After hastily consulting with Lieutenant</p>
<p>Edward H. Day, of the Third United States Artillery, who was with me,</p>
<p>we both concluded that the dust was caused by a body of the enemy</p>
<p>which had slipped in between us and our main force.  There seemed no</p>
<p>alternative left us but to get back to our friends by charging</p>
<p>through these Indians; and as their cloud of dust was much larger</p>
<p>than ours, this appeared a desperate chance.  Preparations to charge</p>
<p>were begun, however, but, much to our surprise, before they were</p>
<p>completed the approaching party halted for a moment and then</p>
<p>commenced to retreat.  This calmed the throbbing of our hearts, and</p>
<p>with a wild cheer we started in a hot pursuit, that continued for</p>
<p>about two miles, when to our great relief we discovered that we were</p>
<p>driving into Rains&#x27;s camp a squadron of Nesmith&#x27;s battalion of Oregon</p>
<p>volunteers that we had mistaken for Indians, and who in turn believed</p>
<p>us to be the enemy.  When camp was reached, we all indulged in a</p>
<p>hearty laugh ovor the affair, and at the fright each party had given</p>
<p>the other.  The explanations which ensued proved that the squadron of</p>
<p>volunteers had separated from the column at the same time that I had</p>
<p>when we debouched from the canon, and had pursued an intermediate</p>
<p>trail through the hills, which brought it into the valley of the</p>
<p>Yakima at a point higher up the river than where I had struck it.</p>
<p>Next day we resumed our march up the valley, parallel to the Yakima.</p>
<p>About 1 o&#x27;clock we saw a large body of Indians on the opposite side</p>
<p>of the river, and the general commanding made up his mind to cross</p>
<p>and attack them.  The stream was cold, deep, and swift, still I</p>
<p>succeeded in passing my dragoons over safely, but had hardly got them</p>
<p>well on the opposite bank when the Indians swooped down upon us.</p>
<p>Dismounting my men, we received the savages with a heavy fire, which</p>
<p>brought them to a halt with some damage and more or less confusion.</p>
<p>General Rains now became very much excited and alarmed about me, and</p>
<p>endeavored to ford the swift river with his infantry and artillery,</p>
<p>but soon had to abandon the attempt, as three or four of the poor</p>
<p>fellows were swept off their feet and drowned.  Meantime Nesmith came</p>
<p>up with his mounted force, crossed over, and joined me.</p>
<p>The Indians now fell back to a high ridge, on the crest of which they</p>
<p>marched and countermarched, threatening to charge down its face.</p>
<p>Most of them were naked, and as their persons were painted in gaudy</p>
<p>colors and decorated with strips of red flannel, red blankets and gay</p>
<p>war-bonnets, their appearance presented a scene of picturesque</p>
<p>barbarism, fascinating but repulsive.  As they numbered about six</p>
<p>hundred, the chances of whipping them did not seem overwhelmingly in</p>
<p>our favor, yet Nesmith and I concluded we would give them a little</p>
<p>fight, provided we could engage them without going beyond the ridge.</p>
<p>But all our efforts were in vain, for as we advanced they retreated,</p>
<p>and as we drew back they reappeared and renewed their parade and</p>
<p>noisy demonstrations, all the time beating their drums and yelling</p>
<p>lustily.  They could not be tempted into a fight where we desired it,</p>
<p>however, and as we felt unequal to any pursuit beyond the ridge</p>
<p>without the assistance of the infantry and artillery, we re-crossed</p>
<p>the river and encamped with Rains.  It soon became apparent that the</p>
<p>noisy demonstrations of the Indians were intended only as a blind to</p>
<p>cover the escape of their women and children to a place of safety in</p>
<p>the mountains.</p>
<p>Next morning we took up our march without crossing the river; and as</p>
<p>our route would lead us by the point on the opposite bank where the</p>
<p>Indians had made their picturesque display the day before, they at an</p>
<p>early hour came over to our side, and rapidly moved ahead of us to</p>
<p>some distant hills, leaving in our pathway some of the more</p>
<p>venturesome young braves, who attempted , to retard our advance by</p>
<p>opening fire at long range from favorable places where they lay</p>
<p>concealed.  This fire did us little harm, but it had the effect of</p>
<p>making our progress so slow that the patience of every one but</p>
<p>General Rains was well-nigh exhausted.</p>
<p>About 2 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon we arrived well up near the base of</p>
<p>the range of hills, and though it was growing late we still had time</p>
<p>to accomplish something, but our commanding officer decided that it</p>
<p>was best to go into camp, and make a systematic attack next morning.</p>
<p>I proposed that he let me charge with my dragoons through the narrow</p>
<p>canon where the river broke through the range, while the infantry</p>
<p>should charge up the hill and drive the enemy from the top down on</p>
<p>the other side.  In this way I thought we might possibly catch some</p>
<p>of the fugitives, but his extreme caution led him to refuse the</p>
<p>suggestion, so we pitched our tents out of range of their desultory</p>
<p>fire, but near enough to observe plainly their menacing and</p>
<p>tantalizing exhibitions of contempt.</p>
<p>In addition to firing occasionally, they called us all sorts of bad</p>
<p>names, made indecent gestures, and aggravated us, so that between 3</p>
<p>and 4 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, by an inexplicable concert of action,</p>
<p>and with a serious breach of discipline, a large number of the men</p>
<p>and many of the officers broke en masse from the camp with loud yells</p>
<p>and charged the offending savages.  As soon as this mob got within</p>
<p>musket-shot they opened fire on the Indians, who ran down the other</p>
<p>face of the ridge without making the slightest resistance.  The hill</p>
<p>was readily taken by this unmilitary proceeding, and no one was hurt</p>
<p>on either side, but as Rains would not permit it to be held, a large</p>
<p>bonfire was lighted on the crest in celebration of the victory, and</p>
<p>then all hands marched back to camp, where they had no sooner arrived</p>
<p>and got settled down than the Indians returned to the summit of the</p>
<p>ridge, seemingly to enjoy the fire that had been so generously built</p>
<p>for their benefit, and with renewed taunts and gestures continued to</p>
<p>insult us.</p>
<p>Our camp that night was strongly picketed, and when we awoke in the</p>
<p>morning the Indians still occupied their position on the hill.  At</p>
<p>daylight we advanced against them, two or three companies of infantry</p>
<p>moving forward to drive them from the summit, while our main column</p>
<p>passed through the canon into the upper Yakima Valley led by my</p>
<p>dragoons, who were not allowed to charge into the gorge, as the</p>
<p>celerity of such a movement might cause the tactical combination to</p>
<p>fail.</p>
<p>As we passed slowly and cautiously through the canon the Indians ran</p>
<p>rapidly away, and when we reached the farther end they had entirely</p>
<p>disappeared from our front, except one old fellow, whose lame horse</p>
<p>prevented him keeping up with the main body.  This presented an</p>
<p>opportunity for gaining results which all thought should not be lost,</p>
<p>so our guide, an Indian named &quot;Cut-mouth John,&quot; seized upon it, and</p>
<p>giving hot chase, soon, overtook the poor creature, whom he speedily</p>
<p>killed without much danger to himself, for the fugitive was armed</p>
<p>with only an old Hudson&#x27;s Bay flint-lock horse-pistol which could not</p>
<p>be discharged.</p>
<p>&quot;Cut-mouth John&#x27;s&quot; engagement began and ended all the fighting that</p>
<p>took place on this occasion, and much disappointment and discontent</p>
<p>followed, Nesmith&#x27;s mounted force and my dragoons being particularly</p>
<p>disgusted because they had not been &quot;given a chance.&quot;  During the</p>
<p>remainder of the day we cautiously followed the retreating foe, and</p>
<p>late in the evening went into camp a short distance from Father</p>
<p>Pandoza&#x27;s Mission; where we were to await a small column of troops</p>
<p>under command of Captain Maurice Maloney, of the Fourth Infantry,</p>
<p>that was to join us from Steilicom by way of the Natchez Pass, and</p>
<p>from which no tidings had as yet been received.</p>
<p>Next morning the first thing I saw when I put my head out from my</p>
<p>blankets was &quot;Cut-mouth John,&quot; already mounted and parading himself</p>
<p>through the camp.  The scalp of the Indian he had despatched the day</p>
<p>before was tied to the cross-bar of his bridle bit, the hair dangling</p>
<p>almost to the ground, and John was decked out in the sacred vestments</p>
<p>of Father Pandoza, having, long before any one was stiring in camp,</p>
<p>ransacked the log-cabin at the Mission in which the good man had</p>
<p>lived.  John was at all times a most repulsive looking individual, a</p>
<p>part of his mouth having been shot away in a fight with Indians near</p>
<p>Walla Walla some years before, in which a Methodist missionary had</p>
<p>been killed; but his revolting personal appearance was now worse than</p>
<p>ever, and the sacrilegious use of Father Pandoza&#x27;s vestments, coupled</p>
<p>with the ghastly scalp that hung from his bridle, so turned opinion</p>
<p>against him that he was soon captured, dismounted, and his parade</p>
<p>brought to an abrupt close, and I doubt whether he ever after quite</p>
<p>reinstated himself in the good graces of the command.</p>
<p>In the course of the day nearly all the men visited the Mission, but</p>
<p>as it had been plundered by the Indians at the outbreak of</p>
<p>hostilities, when Father Pandoza was carried off, little of value was</p>
<p>left about it except a considerable herd of pigs, which the father</p>
<p>with great difficulty had succeeded in accumulating from a very small</p>
<p>beginning.  The pigs had not been disturbed by the Indians, but the</p>
<p>straggling troops soon disposed of them, and then turned their</p>
<p>attention to the cabbages and potatoes in the garden, with the</p>
<p>intention, no doubt, of dining that day on fresh pork and fresh</p>
<p>vegetables instead of on salt junk and hard bread, which formed their</p>
<p>regular diet on the march.  In digging up the potatoes some one</p>
<p>discovered half a keg of powder, which had been buried in the garden</p>
<p>by the good father to prevent the hostile Indians from getting it to</p>
<p>use against the whites.  As soon as this was unearthed wild</p>
<p>excitement ensued, and a cry arose that Father Pandoza was the person</p>
<p>who furnished powder to the Indians; that here was the proof; that at</p>
<p>last the mysterious means by which the Indians obtained ammunition</p>
<p>was explained--and a rush was made for the mission building. This was</p>
<p>a comfortable log-house of good size, built by the Indians for a</p>
<p>school and church, and attached to one end was the log-cabin</p>
<p>residence of the priest.  Its destruction was a matter of but a few</p>
<p>moments.  A large heap of dry wood was quickly collected and piled in</p>
<p>the building, matches applied, and the whole Mission, including the</p>
<p>priest&#x27;s house, was soon enveloped in flames, and burned to the</p>
<p>ground before the officers in camp became aware of the disgraceful</p>
<p>plundering in which their men were engaged.</p>
<p>The commanding officer having received no news from Captain Maloney</p>
<p>during the day, Colonel Nesmith and I were ordered to go to his</p>
<p>rescue, as it was concluded that he had been surrounded by Indians in</p>
<p>the Natchez Pass.  We started early the next morning, the snow</p>
<p>falling slightly as we set out, and soon arrived at the eastern mouth</p>
<p>of the Natchez Pass.  On the way we noticed an abandoned Indian</p>
<p>village, which had evidently not been occupied for some time.  As we</p>
<p>proceeded the storm increased, and the snow-fall became deeper and</p>
<p>deeper, until finally our horses could not travel through it.  In</p>
<p>consequence we were compelled to give up further efforts to advance,</p>
<p>and obliged to turn back to the abandoned village, where we encamped</p>
<p>for the night.  Near night-fall the storm greatly increased, and our</p>
<p>bivouac became most uncomfortable; but spreading my blankets on the</p>
<p>snow and covering them with Indian matting, I turned in and slept</p>
<p>with that soundness and refreshment accorded by nature to one</p>
<p>exhausted by fatigue.  When I awoke in the morning I found myself</p>
<p>under about two feet of snow, from which I arose with difficulty, yet</p>
<p>grateful that it had kept me warm during the night.</p>
<p>After a cup of coffee and a little hard bread, it was decided we</p>
<p>should return to the main camp near the Mission, for we were now</p>
<p>confident that Maloney was delayed by the snow, and safe enough on</p>
<p>the other side of the mountains.  At all events he was beyond aid</p>
<p>from us, for the impassable snowdrifts could not be overcome with the</p>
<p>means in our possession.  It turned out that our suppositions as to</p>
<p>the cause of his delay were correct.  He had met with the same</p>
<p>difficulties that confronted us, and had been compelled to go into</p>
<p>camp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile valuable time had been lost, and the Indians, with their</p>
<p>families and stock, were well on their way to the Okenagan country, a</p>
<p>region into which we could not penetrate in the winter season.  No</p>
<p>other course was therefore left but to complete the dismal failure of</p>
<p>the expedition by returning home, and our commander readily gave the</p>
<p>order to march back to the Dalles by the &quot;short&quot; route over the</p>
<p>Yakima Mountains.</p>
<p>As the storm was still unabated, it was evident our march home would</p>
<p>be a most difficult one, and it was deemed advisable to start back at</p>
<p>once, lest we should be blocked up in the mountains by the snows for</p>
<p>a period beyond which our provisions would not last.  Relying on the</p>
<p>fact that the short route to the Dalles would lead us over the range</p>
<p>at its most depressed point, where it was hoped the depth of snow was</p>
<p>not yet so great as to make the route impassable, we started with</p>
<p>Colonel Nesmith&#x27;s battalion in advance to break the road, followed by</p>
<p>my dragoons.  In the valley we made rapid progress, but when we</p>
<p>reached the mountain every step we took up its side showed the snow</p>
<p>to be growing deeper and deeper.  At last Nesmith reached the summit,</p>
<p>and there found a depth of about six feet of snow covering the</p>
<p>plateau in every direction, concealing all signs of the trail so</p>
<p>thoroughly that his guides became bewildered and took the wrong</p>
<p>divide.  The moment I arrived at the top my guide--Donald Mc Kay--who</p>
<p>knew perfectly the whole Yakima range, discovered Nesmith&#x27;s mistake.</p>
<p>Word was sent to bring him back, but as he had already nearly crossed</p>
<p>the plateau, considerable delay occurred before he returned.  When he</p>
<p>arrived we began anew the work of breaking a road for the foot troops</p>
<p>behind us, my detachment now in advance.  The deep snow made our work</p>
<p>extremely laborious, exhausting men and horses almost to the point of</p>
<p>relinquishing the struggle, but our desperate situation required that</p>
<p>we should get down into the valley beyond, or run the chance of</p>
<p>perishing on the mountain in a storm which seemed unending.  About</p>
<p>midnight the column reached the valley, very tired and hungry, but</p>
<p>much elated over its escape.  We had spent a day of the most intense</p>
<p>anxiety, especially those who had had the responsibility of keeping</p>
<p>to the right trail, and been charged with the hard work of breaking</p>
<p>the road for the infantry and artillery through such a depth of snow.</p>
<p>Our main difficulties were now over, and in due time we reached the</p>
<p>Dalles, where almost everyone connected with the expedition voted it</p>
<p>a wretched failure; indeed, General Rains himself could not think</p>
<p>otherwise, but he scattered far and wide blame for the failure of his</p>
<p>combinations.  This, of course, led to criminations and</p>
<p>recriminations, which eventuated in charges of incompetency preferred</p>
<p>against him by Captain Edward O. C. Ord, of the Third Artillery.</p>
<p>Rains met the charges with counter-charges against Ord, whom he</p>
<p>accused of purloining Father Pandoza&#x27;s shoes, when the soldiers in</p>
<p>their fury about the ammunition destroyed the Mission.  At the time</p>
<p>of its destruction a rumor of this nature was circulated through</p>
<p>camp, started by some wag, no doubt in jest; for Ord, who was</p>
<p>somewhat eccentric in his habits, and had started on the expedition</p>
<p>rather indifferently shod in carpet-slippers, here came out in a</p>
<p>brand-new pair of shoes.  Of course there was no real foundation for</p>
<p>such a report, but Rains was not above small things, as the bringing</p>
<p>of this petty accusation attests.  Neither party was ever tried, for</p>
<p>General John E. Wool the department commander, had not at command a</p>
<p>sufficient number of officers of appropriate rank to constitute a</p>
<p>court in the case of Rains, and the charges against Ord were very</p>
<p>properly ignored on account of their trifling character.</p>
<p>Shortly after the expedition returned to the Dalles, my detachment</p>
<p>was sent down to Fort Vancouver, and I remained at that post during</p>
<p>the winter of 1855-&#x27;56, till late in March.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>AN INDIAN CONFEDERATION--MASSACRE AT THE CASCADES OF THE COLUMBIA-</p>
<p>-PLAN TO RELIEVE THE BLOCKHOUSE--A HAZARDOUS FLANK MOVEMENT--A NEW</p>
<p>METHOD OF ESTABLISHING GUILT--EXECUTION OF THE INDIAN MURDERERS.</p>
<p>The failure of the Haller expedition from lack of a sufficient force,</p>
<p>and of the Rains expedition from the incompetency of its commander,</p>
<p>was a great mortification to the officers and men connected with</p>
<p>them, and, taken together, had a marked effect upon the Indian</p>
<p>situation in Oregon and Washington Territories at that particular</p>
<p>era.  Besides, it led to further complications and troubles, for it</p>
<p>had begun to dawn upon the Indians that the whites wanted to come in</p>
<p>and dispossess them of their lands and homes, and the failures of</p>
<p>Haller and Rains fostered the belief with the Indians that they could</p>
<p>successfully resist the pressure of civilization.</p>
<p>Acting under these influences, the Spokanes, Walla Wallas, Umatillas,</p>
<p>and Nez Perces cast their lot with the hostiles, and all the savage</p>
<p>inhabitants of the region east of the Cascade Range became involved</p>
<p>in a dispute as to whether the Indians or the Government should</p>
<p>possess certain sections of the country, which finally culminated in</p>
<p>the war of 1856.</p>
<p>Partly to meet the situation that was approaching, the Ninth Infantry</p>
<p>had been sent out from the Atlantic coast to Washington Territory,</p>
<p>and upon its arrival at Fort Vancouver encamped in front of the</p>
<p>officers&#x27; quarters, on the beautiful parade-ground of that post, and</p>
<p>set about preparing for the coming campaign.  The commander, Colonel</p>
<p>George Wright, who had been promoted to the colonelcy of the regiment</p>
<p>upon its organization the previous year, had seen much active duty</p>
<p>since his graduation over thirty years before, serving with credit in</p>
<p>the Florida and Mexican wars.  For the three years previous to his</p>
<p>assignment to the Ninth Infantry he had been stationed on the Pacific</p>
<p>coast, and the experience he had there acquired, added to his</p>
<p>excellent soldierly qualities, was of much benefit in the active</p>
<p>campaigns in which, during the following years, he was to</p>
<p>participate.  Subsequently his career was brought to an untimely</p>
<p>close when, nine years after this period, as he was returning to the</p>
<p>scene of his successes, he, in common with many others was drowned by</p>
<p>the wreck of the ill-fated steamer Brother Jonathan.  Colonel Wright</p>
<p>took command of the district in place of Rains, and had been at</p>
<p>Vancouver but a short time before he realized that it would be</p>
<p>necessary to fight the confederated tribes east of the Cascade Range</p>
<p>of mountains, in order to disabuse them of the idea that they were</p>
<p>sufficiently strong to cope with the power of the Government.  He</p>
<p>therefore at once set about the work of organizing and equipping his</p>
<p>troops for a start in the early spring against the hostile Indians,</p>
<p>intending to make the objective point of his expedition the heart of</p>
<p>the Spokane country on the Upper Columbia River, as the head and</p>
<p>front of the confederation was represented in the person of old</p>
<p>Cammiackan, chief of the Spokanes.</p>
<p>The regiment moved from Fort Vancouver by boat, March 25, 1856, and</p>
<p>landed at the small town called the Dalles, below the mouth of the</p>
<p>Des Chutes River at the eastern base of the Cascade Range, and just</p>
<p>above where the Columbia River enters those mountains.  This</p>
<p>rendezvous was to be the immediate point of departure, and all the</p>
<p>troops composing the expedition were concentrated there.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 26 the movement began, but the column had</p>
<p>only reached Five Mile Creek when the Yakimas, joined by many young</p>
<p>warriors-free lances from other tribes, made a sudden and unexpected</p>
<p>attack at the Cascades of the Columbia, midway between Vancouver and</p>
<p>the Dalles, killed several citizens, women and children, and took</p>
<p>possession of the Portage by besieging the settlers in their cabins</p>
<p>at the Upper Cascades, and those who sought shelter at the Middle</p>
<p>Cascades in the old military block-house, which had been built some</p>
<p>years before as a place of refuge under just such circumstances.</p>
<p>These points held out, and were not captured, but the landing at the</p>
<p>Lower Cascades fell completely into the hands of the savages.</p>
<p>Straggling settlers from the Lower Cascades made their way down to</p>
<p>Fort Vancouver, distant about thirty-six miles, which they reached</p>
<p>that night; and communicated the condition of affairs.  As the</p>
<p>necessity for early relief to the settlers and the re-establishment</p>
<p>of communication with the Dalles were apparent, all the force that</p>
<p>could be spared was ordered out, and in consequence I immediately</p>
<p>received directions to go with my detachment of dragoons, numbering</p>
<p>about forty effective men, to the relief of the middle blockhouse,</p>
<p>which really meant to retake the Cascades.  I got ready at once, and</p>
<p>believing that a piece of artillery would be of service to me, asked</p>
<p>for one, but as there proved to be no guns at the post, I should have</p>
<p>been obliged to proceed without one had it not been that the regular</p>
<p>steamer from San Francisco to Portland was lying at the Vancouver</p>
<p>dock unloading military supplies, and the commander, Captain Dall,</p>
<p>supplied me with the steamer&#x27;s small iron cannon, mounted on a wooden</p>
<p>platform, which he used in firing salutes at different ports on the</p>
<p>arrival and departure of the vessel.  Finding at the arsenal a supply</p>
<p>of solid shot that would fit the gun, I had it put upon the steamboat</p>
<p>Belle, employed to carry my command to the scene of operations, and</p>
<p>started up the Columbia River at 2 A.M. on the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>We reached the Lower Cascades early in the day, where, selecting a</p>
<p>favorable place for the purpose, I disembarked my men and gun on the</p>
<p>north bank of the river, so that I could send back the steamboat to</p>
<p>bring up any volunteer assistance that in the mean time might have</p>
<p>been collected at Vancouver.</p>
<p>The Columbia River was very high at the time, and the water had</p>
<p>backed up into the slough about the foot of the Lower Cascades to</p>
<p>such a degree that it left me only a narrow neck of firm ground to</p>
<p>advance over toward the point occupied by the Indians.  On this neck</p>
<p>of land the hostiles had taken position, as I soon learned by</p>
<p>frequent shots, loud shouting, and much blustering; they, by the most</p>
<p>exasperating yells and indecent exhibitions, daring me to the</p>
<p>contest.</p>
<p>After getting well in hand everything connected with my little</p>
<p>command, I advanced with five or six men to the edge of a growth of</p>
<p>underbrush to make a reconnoissance.  We stole along under cover of</p>
<p>this underbrush until we reached the open ground leading over the</p>
<p>causeway or narrow neck before mentioned, when the enemy opened fire</p>
<p>and killed a soldier near my side by a shot which, just grazing the</p>
<p>bridge of my nose, struck him in the neck, opening an artery and</p>
<p>breaking the spinal cord.  He died instantly.  The Indians at once</p>
<p>made a rush for the body, but my men in the rear, coming quickly to</p>
<p>the rescue, drove them back; and Captain Doll&#x27;s gun being now brought</p>
<p>into play, many solid shot were thrown into the jungle where they lay</p>
<p>concealed, with the effect of considerably moderating their</p>
<p>impetuosity.  Further skirmishing at long range took place at</p>
<p>intervals during the day, with little gain or loss, however, to</p>
<p>either side, for both parties held positions which could not be</p>
<p>assailed in flank, and only the extreme of rashness in either could</p>
<p>prompt a front attack.  My left was protected by the back water</p>
<p>driven into the slough by the high stage of the river, and my right</p>
<p>rested secure on the main stream.  Between us was only the narrow</p>
<p>neck of land, to cross which would be certain death.  The position of</p>
<p>the Indians was almost the exact counterpart of ours.</p>
<p>In the evening I sent a report of the situation back to Vancouver by</p>
<p>the steamboat, retaining a large Hudson&#x27;s Bay bateau which I had</p>
<p>brought up with me.  Examining this I found it would carry about</p>
<p>twenty men, and made up my mind that early next morning I would cross</p>
<p>the command to the opposite or south side of the Columbia River, and</p>
<p>make my way up along the mountain base until I arrived abreast the</p>
<p>middle blockhouse, which was still closely besieged, and then at some</p>
<p>favorable point recross to the north bank to its relief, endeavoring</p>
<p>in this manner to pass around and to the rear of the Indians, whose</p>
<p>position confronting me was too strong for a direct attack.  This</p>
<p>plan was hazardous, but I believed it could be successfully carried</p>
<p>out if the boat could be taken with me; but should I not be able to</p>
<p>do this I felt that the object contemplated in sending me out would</p>
<p>miserably fail, and the small band cooped up at the block-house would</p>
<p>soon starve or fall a prey to the Indians, so I concluded to risk all</p>
<p>the chances the plan involved.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 28 the savages were still in my front, and</p>
<p>after giving them some solid shot from Captain Dall&#x27;s gun we slipped</p>
<p>down to the river-bank, and the detachment crossed by means of the</p>
<p>Hudson&#x27;s Bay boat, making a landing on the opposite shore at a point</p>
<p>where the south channel of the river, after flowing around Bradford&#x27;s</p>
<p>Island, joins the main stream.  It was then about 9 o&#x27;clock, and</p>
<p>everything had thus far proceeded favorably, but examination of the</p>
<p>channel showed that it would be impossible to get the boat up the</p>
<p>rapids along the mainland, and that success could only be assured by</p>
<p>crossing the south channel just below the rapids to the island, along</p>
<p>the shore of which there was every probability we could pull the boat</p>
<p>through the rocks and swift water until the head of the rapids was</p>
<p>reached, from which point to the block-house there was smooth water.</p>
<p>Telling the men of the embarrassment in which I found myself, and</p>
<p>that if I could get enough of them to man the boat and pull it up the</p>
<p>stream by a rope to the shore we would cross to the island and make</p>
<p>the attempt, all volunteered to go, but as ten men seemed sufficient</p>
<p>I selected that number to accompany me.  Before starting, however, I</p>
<p>deemed it prudent to find out if possible what was engaging the</p>
<p>attention of the Indians, who had not yet discovered that we had left</p>
<p>their front.  I therefore climbed up the side of the abrupt mountain</p>
<p>which skirted the water&#x27;s edge until I could see across the island.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From this point I observed the Indians running horse-races and</p>
</blockquote>
<p>otherwise enjoying themselves behind the line they had held against</p>
<p>me the day before.  The squaws decked out in gay colors, and the men</p>
<p>gaudily dressed in war bonnets, made the scene most attractive, but</p>
<p>as everything looked propitious for the dangerous enterprise in hand</p>
<p>I spent little time watching them.  Quickly returning to the boat, I</p>
<p>crossed to the island with my ten men, threw ashore the rope attached</p>
<p>to the bow, and commenced the difficult task of pulling her up the</p>
<p>rapids.  We got along slowly at first, but soon striking a camp of</p>
<p>old squaws who had been left on the island for safety, and had not</p>
<p>gone over to the mainland to see the races, we utilized them to our</p>
<p>advantage.  With unmistakable threats and signs we made them not only</p>
<p>keep quiet, but also give us much needed assistance in pulling</p>
<p>vigorously on the towrope of our boat.</p>
<p>I was laboring under a dreadful strain of mental anxiety during all</p>
<p>this time, for had the Indians discovered what we were about, they</p>
<p>could easily have come over to the island in their canoes, and, by</p>
<p>forcing us to take up our arms to repel their attack, doubtless would</p>
<p>have obliged the abandonment of the boat, and that essential adjunct</p>
<p>to the final success of my plan would have gone down the rapids.</p>
<p>Indeed, under such circumstances, it would have been impossible for</p>
<p>ten men to hold out against the two or three hundred Indians; but the</p>
<p>island forming an excellent screen to our movements, we were not</p>
<p>discovered, and when we reached the smooth water at the upper end of</p>
<p>the rapids we quickly crossed over and joined the rest of the men,</p>
<p>who in the meantime had worked their way along the south bank of the</p>
<p>river parallel with us.  I felt very grateful to the old squaws for</p>
<p>the assistance they rendered.  They worked well under compulsion, and</p>
<p>manifested no disposition to strike for higher wages.  Indeed, I was</p>
<p>so much relieved when we had crossed over from the island and joined</p>
<p>the rest of the party, that I mentally thanked the squaws one and</p>
<p>all.  I had much difficulty in keeping the men on the main shore from</p>
<p>cheering at our success, but hurriedly taking into the bateau all of</p>
<p>them it could carry, I sent the balance along the southern bank,</p>
<p>where the railroad is now built, until both detachments arrived at a</p>
<p>point opposite the block-house, when, crossing to the north bank, I</p>
<p>landed below the blockhouse some little distance, and returned the</p>
<p>boat for the balance of the men, who joined me in a few minutes.</p>
<p>When the Indians attacked the people at the Cascades on the 26th,</p>
<p>word was sent to Colonel Wright, who had already got out from the</p>
<p>Dalles a few miles on his expedition to the Spokane country.  He</p>
<p>immediately turned his column back, and soon after I had landed and</p>
<p>communicated with the beleaguered block-house the advance of his</p>
<p>command arrived under LieutenantColonel Edward J. Steptoe.  I</p>
<p>reported to Steptoe, and related what had occurred during the past</p>
<p>thirty-six hours, gave him a description of the festivities that were</p>
<p>going on at the lower Cascades, and also communicated the</p>
<p>intelligence that the Yakimas had been joined by the Cascade Indians</p>
<p>when the place was first attacked.  I also told him it was my belief</p>
<p>that when he pushed down the main shore the latter tribe without</p>
<p>doubt would cross over to the island we had just left, while the</p>
<p>former would take to the mountains.  Steptoe coincided with me in</p>
<p>this opinion, and informing me that Lieutenant Alexander Piper would</p>
<p>join my detachment with a mountain&#x27; howitzer, directed me to convey</p>
<p>the command to the island and gobble up all who came over to it.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Piper and I landed on the island with the first boatload,</p>
<p>and after disembarking the howitzer we fired two or three shots to</p>
<p>let the Indians know we had artillery with us, then advanced down the</p>
<p>island with the whole of my command, which had arrived in the mean</p>
<p>time; all of the men were deployed as skirmishers except a small</p>
<p>detachment to operate the howitzer.  Near the lower end of the island</p>
<p>we met, as I had anticipated, the entire body of Cascade Indianmen,</p>
<p>women, and children--whose homes were in the vicinity of the</p>
<p>Cascades.  They were very much frightened and demoralized at the turn</p>
<p>events had taken, for the Yakimas at the approach of Steptoe had</p>
<p>abandoned them, as predicted, and fled to the mountians.  The chief</p>
<p>and head-men said they had had nothing to do with the capture of the</p>
<p>Cascades, with the murder of men at the upper landing, nor with the</p>
<p>massacre of men, women, and children near the block-house, and put</p>
<p>all the blame on the Yakimas and their allies.  I did not believe</p>
<p>this, however, and to test the truth of their statement formed them</p>
<p>all in line with their muskets in hand.  Going up to the first man on</p>
<p>the right I accused him of having engaged in the massacre, but was</p>
<p>met by a vigorous denial.  Putting my forefinger into the muzzle of</p>
<p>his gun, I found unmistakable signs of its having been recently</p>
<p>discharged.  My finger was black with the stains of burnt powder, and</p>
<p>holding it up to the Indian, he had nothing more to say in the face</p>
<p>of such positive evidence of his guilt.  A further examination proved</p>
<p>that all the guns were in the same condition.  Their arms were at</p>
<p>once taken possession of, and leaving a small, force to look after</p>
<p>the women and children and the very old men, so that there could be</p>
<p>no possibility of escape, I arrested thirteen of the principal</p>
<p>miscreants, crossed the river to the lower landing, and placed them</p>
<p>in charge of a strong guard.</p>
<p>Late in the evening the steamboat, which I had sent back to</p>
<p>Vancouver, returned, bringing to my assistance from Vancouver,</p>
<p>Captain Henry D. Wallen&#x27;s company of the Fourth Infantry and a</p>
<p>company of volunteers hastily organized at Portland, but as the</p>
<p>Cascades had already been retaken, this reinforcement was too late to</p>
<p>participate in the affair.  The volunteers from Portland, however,</p>
<p>were spoiling for a fight, and in the absence of other opportunity</p>
<p>desired to shoot the prisoners I held (who, they alleged, had killed</p>
<p>a man named Seymour), and proceeded to make their arrangements to do</p>
<p>so, only desisting on being informed that the Indians were my</p>
<p>prisoners, subject to the orders of Colonel Wright, and would be</p>
<p>protected to the last by my detachment.  Not long afterward Seymour</p>
<p>turned up safe and sound, having fled at the beginning of the attack</p>
<p>on the Cascades, and hid somewhere in the thick underbrush until the</p>
<p>trouble was over, and then made his way back to the settlement.  The</p>
<p>next day I turned my prisoners over to Colonel Wright, who had them</p>
<p>marched to the upper landing of the Cascades, where, after a trial by</p>
<p>a military commission, nine of them were sentenced to death and duly</p>
<p>hanged.  I did not see them executed, but was afterward informed</p>
<p>that, in the absence of the usual mechanical apparatus used on such</p>
<p>occasions, a tree with a convenient limb under which two empty</p>
<p>barrels were placed, one on top of the other, furnished a rude but</p>
<p>certain substitute.  In executing the sentence each Indian in turn</p>
<p>was made to stand on the top barrel, and after the noose was adjusted</p>
<p>the lower barrel was knocked away, and the necessary drop thus</p>
<p>obtained.  In this way the whole nine were punished.  Just before</p>
<p>death they all acknowledged their guilt by confessing their</p>
<p>participation in the massacre at the block-house, and met their doom</p>
<p>with the usual stoicism of their race.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<p>MISDIRECTED VENGEANCE--HONORABLE MENTION--CHANGE OF COMMAND--EDUCATED</p>
<p>OXEN--FEEDING THE INDIANS--PURCHASING A BURYING-GROUND--KNOWING RATS.</p>
<p>While still encamped at the lower landing, some three or four days</p>
<p>after the events last recounted, Mr. Joseph Meek, an old frontiersman</p>
<p>and guide for emigrant trains through the mountains, came down from</p>
<p>the Dalles, on his way to Vancouver, and stopped at my camp to</p>
<p>inquire if an Indian named Spencer and his family had passed down to</p>
<p>Vancouver since my arrival at the Cascades.  Spencer, the head of the</p>
<p>family, was a very influential, peaceable Chinook chief, whom Colonel</p>
<p>Wright had taken with him from Fort Vancouver as an interpreter and</p>
<p>mediator with the Spokanes and other hostile tribes, against which</p>
<p>his campaign was directed.  He was a good, reliable Indian, and on</p>
<p>leaving Vancouver to join Colonel Wright, took his family along, to</p>
<p>remain with relatives and friends at Fort Dalles until the return of</p>
<p>the expedition.  When Wright was compelled to retrace his steps on</p>
<p>account of the capture of the Cascades, this family for some reason</p>
<p>known only to Spencer, was started by him down the river to their</p>
<p>home at Vancouver.</p>
<p>Meek, on seeing the family leave the Dalles, had some misgivings as</p>
<p>to their safe arrival at their destination, because of the excited</p>
<p>condition of the people about the Cascades; but Spencer seemed to</p>
<p>think that his own peaceable and friendly reputation, which was</p>
<p>widespread, would protect them; so he parted from his wife and</p>
<p>children with little apprehension as to their safety.  In reply to</p>
<p>Meek&#x27;s question, I stated that I had not seen Spencer&#x27;s family, when</p>
<p>he remarked, &quot;Well, I fear that they are gone up,&quot; a phrase used in</p>
<p>that country in early days to mean that they had been killed.  I</p>
<p>questioned him closely, to elicit further information, but no more</p>
<p>could be obtained; for Meek, either through ignorance or the usual</p>
<p>taciturnity of his class, did not explain more fully, and when the</p>
<p>steamer that had brought the reinforcement started down the river, he</p>
<p>took passage for Vancouver, to learn definitely if the Indian family</p>
<p>had reached that point.  I at once sent to the upper landing, distant</p>
<p>about six miles, to make inquiry in regard to the matter, and in a,</p>
<p>little time my messenger returned with the information that the</p>
<p>family had reached that place the day before, and finding that we had</p>
<p>driven the hostiles off, continued their journey on foot toward my</p>
<p>camp, from which point they expected to go by steamer down the river</p>
<p>to Vancouver.</p>
<p>Their non-arrival aroused in me suspicions of foul play, so with all</p>
<p>the men I could spare, and accompanied by Lieutenant William T.</p>
<p>Welcker, of the Ordnance Corps--a warm and intimate friend--I went in</p>
<p>search of the family, deploying the men as skirmishers across the</p>
<p>valley, and marching them through the heavy forest where the ground</p>
<p>was covered with fallen timber and dense underbrush, in order that no</p>
<p>point might escape our attention.  The search was continued between</p>
<p>the base of the mountain and the river without finding any sign of</p>
<p>Spencer&#x27;s family, until about 3 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, when we</p>
<p>discovered them between the upper and lower landing, in a small open</p>
<p>space about a mile from the road, all dead--strangled to death with</p>
<p>bits of rope.  The party consisted of the mother, two youths, three</p>
<p>girls, and a baby.  They had all been killed by white men, who had</p>
<p>probably met the innocent creatures somewhere near the blockhouse,</p>
<p>driven them from the road into the timber, where the cruel murders</p>
<p>were committed without provocation, and for no other purpose than the</p>
<p>gratification of the inordinate hatred of the Indian that has often</p>
<p>existed on the frontier, and which on more than one occasion has</p>
<p>failed to distinguish friend from foe.  The bodies lay in a</p>
<p>semicircle, and the bits of rope with which the poor wretches had</p>
<p>been strangled to death were still around their necks.  Each piece of</p>
<p>rope--the unwound strand of a heavier piece--was about two feet long,</p>
<p>and encircled the neck of its victim with a single knot, that must</p>
<p>have been drawn tight by the murderers pulling at the ends.  As there</p>
<p>had not been quite enough rope to answer for all, the babe was</p>
<p>strangled by means of a red silk handkerchief, taken, doubtless, from</p>
<p>the neck of its mother.  It was a distressing sight.  A most cruel</p>
<p>outrage had been committed upon unarmed people--our friends and</p>
<p>allies--in a spirit of aimless revenge.  The perpetrators were</p>
<p>citizens living near the middle block-house, whose wives and children</p>
<p>had been killed a few days before by the hostiles, but who well knew</p>
<p>that these unoffending creatures had had nothing to do with those</p>
<p>murders.</p>
<p>In my experience I have been obliged to look upon many cruel scenes</p>
<p>in connection with Indian warfare on the Plains since that day, but</p>
<p>the effect of this dastardly and revolting crime has never been</p>
<p>effaced from my memory.  Greater and more atrocious massacres have</p>
<p>been committed often by Indians; their savage nature modifies one&#x27;s</p>
<p>ideas, however, as to the inhumanity of their acts, but when such</p>
<p>wholesale murder as this is done by whites, and the victims not only</p>
<p>innocent, but helpless, no defense can be made for those who</p>
<p>perpetrated the crime, if they claim to be civilized beings.  It is</p>
<p>true the people at the Cascades had suffered much, and that their</p>
<p>wives and children had been murdered before their eyes, but to wreak</p>
<p>vengeance on Spencer&#x27;s unoffending family, who had walked into their</p>
<p>settlement under the protection of a friendly alliance, was an</p>
<p>unparalleled outrage which nothing can justify or extenuate.  With as</p>
<p>little delay as possible after the horrible discovery, I returned to</p>
<p>camp, had boxes made, and next day buried the bodies of these hapless</p>
<p>victims of misdirected vengeance.</p>
<p>The summary punishment inflicted on the nine Indians, in their trial</p>
<p>and execution, had a most salutary effect on the confederation, and</p>
<p>was the entering wedge to its disintegration; and though Colonel</p>
<p>Wright&#x27;s campaign continued during the summer and into the early</p>
<p>winter, the subjugation of the allied bands became a comparatively</p>
<p>easy matter after the lesson taught the renegades who were captured</p>
<p>at the Cascades.  My detachment did not accompany Colonel Wright, but</p>
<p>remained for some time at the Cascades, and while still there General</p>
<p>Wool came up from San Francisco to take a look into the condition of</p>
<p>things.  From his conversation with me in reference to the affair at</p>
<p>the Cascades, I gathered that he was greatly pleased at the service I</p>
<p>had performed, and I afterward found that his report of my conduct</p>
<p>had so favorably impressed General Scott that that distinguished</p>
<p>officer complimented me from the headquarters of the army in general</p>
<p>orders.</p>
<p>General Wool, while personally supervising matters on the Columbia</p>
<p>River, directed a redistribution to some extent of the troops in the</p>
<p>district, and shortly before his return to San Francisco I was</p>
<p>ordered with my detachment of dragoons to take station on the Grande</p>
<p>Ronde Indian Reservation in Yamhill County, Oregon, about twenty-five</p>
<p>miles southwest of Dayton, and to relieve from duty at that point</p>
<p>Lieutenant William B. Hazen--late brigadier-general and chief signal</p>
<p>officer--who had established a camp there some time before.  I</p>
<p>started for my new station on April 21, and marching by way of</p>
<p>Portland and Oregon City, arrived at Hazen&#x27;s camp April 25.  The camp</p>
<p>was located in the Coast range of mountains, on the northeast part of</p>
<p>the reservation, to which last had been added a section of country</p>
<p>that was afterward known as the Siletz reservation.  The whole body</p>
<p>of land set aside went under the general name of the &quot;Coast</p>
<p>reservation,&quot; from its skirting the Pacific Ocean for some distance</p>
<p>north of Yaquina Bay, and the intention was to establish within its</p>
<p>bounds permanent homes for such Indians as might be removed to it.</p>
<p>In furtherance of this idea, and to relieve northern California and</p>
<p>southwestern Oregon from the roaming, restless bands that kept the</p>
<p>people of those sections in a state of constant turmoil, many of the</p>
<p>different tribes, still under control but liable to take part in</p>
<p>warfare, were removed to the reservation, so that they might be away</p>
<p>from the theatre of hostilities.</p>
<p>When I arrived I found that the Rogue River Indians had just been</p>
<p>placed upon the reservation, and subsequently the Coquille, Klamath,</p>
<p>Modocs, and remnants of the Chinooks were collected there also, the</p>
<p>home of the latter being in the Willamette Valley.  The number all</p>
<p>told amounted to some thousands, scattered over the entire Coast</p>
<p>reservation, but about fifteen hundred were located at the Grande</p>
<p>Ronde under charge of an agent, Mr. John F. Miller, a sensible,</p>
<p>practical man, who left the entire police control to the military,</p>
<p>and attended faithfully to the duty of settling the Indians in the</p>
<p>work of cultivating the soil.</p>
<p>As the place was to be occupied permanently, Lieutenant Hazen had</p>
<p>begun, before my arrival, the erection of buildings for the shelter</p>
<p>of his command, and I continued the work of constructing the post as</p>
<p>laid out by him.  In those days the Government did not provide very</p>
<p>liberally for sheltering its soldiers; and officers and men were</p>
<p>frequently forced to eke out parsimonious appropriations by toilsome</p>
<p>work or go without shelter in most inhospitable regions.  Of course</p>
<p>this post was no exception to the general rule, and as all hands were</p>
<p>occupied in its construction, and I the only officer present, I was</p>
<p>kept busily employed in supervising matters, both as commandant and</p>
<p>quartermaster, until July, when Captain D. A. Russell, of the Fourth</p>
<p>Infantry, was ordered to take command, and I was relieved from the</p>
<p>first part of my duties.</p>
<p>About this time my little detachment parted from me, being ordered to</p>
<p>join a company of the First Dragoons, commanded by Captain Robert</p>
<p>Williams, as it passed up the country from California by way of</p>
<p>Yamhill.  I regretted exceedingly to see them go, for their faithful</p>
<p>work and gallant service had endeared every man to me by the</p>
<p>strongest ties.  Since I relieved Lieutenant Hood on Pit River,</p>
<p>nearly a twelvemonth before, they had been my constant companions,</p>
<p>and the zeal with which they had responded to every call I made on</p>
<p>them had inspired in my heart a deep affection that years have not</p>
<p>removed.  When I relieved Hood--a dragoon officer of their own</p>
<p>regiment--they did not like the change, and I understood that they</p>
<p>somewhat contemptuously expressed this in more ways than one, in</p>
<p>order to try the temper of the new &quot;Leftenant,&quot; but appreciative and</p>
<p>unremitting care, together with firm and just discipline, soon</p>
<p>quieted all symptoms of dissatisfaction and overcame all prejudice.</p>
<p>The detachment had been made up of details from the different</p>
<p>companies of the regiment in order to give Williamson a mounted</p>
<p>force, and as it was usual, under such circumstances, for every</p>
<p>company commander to shove into the detail he was called upon to</p>
<p>furnish the most troublesome and insubordinate individuals of his</p>
<p>company, I had some difficulty, when first taking command, in</p>
<p>controlling such a medley of recalcitrants; but by forethought for</p>
<p>them and their wants, and a strict watchfulness for their rights and</p>
<p>comfort, I was able in a short time to make them obedient and the</p>
<p>detachment cohesive.  In the past year they had made long and</p>
<p>tiresome marches, forded swift mountain streams, constructed rafts of</p>
<p>logs or bundles of dry reeds to ferry our baggage, swum deep rivers,</p>
<p>marched on foot to save their worn-out and exhausted animals, climbed</p>
<p>mountains, fought Indians, and in all and everything had done the</p>
<p>best they could for the service and their commander.  The disaffected</p>
<p>feeling they entertained when I first assumed command soon wore away,</p>
<p>and in its place came a confidence and respect which it gives me the</p>
<p>greatest pleasure to remember, for small though it was, this was my</p>
<p>first cavalry command.  They little thought, when we were in the</p>
<p>mountains of California and Oregon--nor did I myself then dream--that</p>
<p>but a few years were to elapse before it would be my lot again to</p>
<p>command dragoons, this time in numbers so vast as of themselves to</p>
<p>compose almost an army.</p>
<p>Shortly after the arrival of Captain Russell a portion of the Indians</p>
<p>at the Grande Ronde reservation were taken down the coast to the</p>
<p>Siletz reservation, and I was transferred temporarily to Fort</p>
<p>Haskins, on the latter reserve, and assigned to the duty of</p>
<p>completing it and building a blockhouse for the police control of the</p>
<p>Indians placed there.</p>
<p>While directing this work, I undertook to make a road across the</p>
<p>coast mountains from King&#x27;s Valley to the Siletz, to shorten the haul</p>
<p>between the two points by a route I had explored.  I knew there were</p>
<p>many obstacles in the way, but the gain would be great if we could</p>
<p>overcome them, so I set to work with the enthusiasm of a young path-</p>
<p>finder.  The point at which the road was to cross the range was rough</p>
<p>and precipitous, but the principal difficulty in making it would be</p>
<p>from heavy timber on the mountains that had been burned over years</p>
<p>and years before, until nothing was left but limbless trunks of dead</p>
<p>trees--firs and pines--that had fallen from time to time until the</p>
<p>ground was matted with huge logs from five to eight feet in diameter.</p>
<p>These could not be chopped with axes nor sawed by any ordinary means,</p>
<p>therefore we had to burn them into suitable lengths, and drag the</p>
<p>sections to either side of the roadway with from four to six yoke of</p>
<p>oxen.</p>
<p>The work was both tedious and laborious, but in time perseverance</p>
<p>surmounted all obstacles and the road was finished, though its grades</p>
<p>were very steep.  As soon as it was completed, I wished to</p>
<p>demonstrate its value practically, so I started a Government wagon</p>
<p>over it loaded with about fifteen hundred pounds of freight drawn by</p>
<p>six yoke of oxen, and escorted by a small detachment of soldiers.</p>
<p>When it had gone about seven miles the sergeant in charge came back</p>
<p>to the post and reported his inability to get any further.  Going out</p>
<p>to the scene of difficulty I found the wagon at the base of a steep</p>
<p>hill, stalled.  Taking up a whip myself, I directed the men to lay on</p>
<p>their gads, for each man had supplied himself with a flexible hickory</p>
<p>withe in the early stages of the trip, to start the team, but this</p>
<p>course did not move the wagon nor have much effect on the demoralized</p>
<p>oxen; but following as a last resort an example I heard of on a</p>
<p>former occasion, that brought into use the rough language of the</p>
<p>country, I induced the oxen to move with alacrity, and the wagon and</p>
<p>contents were speedily carried to the summit.  The whole trouble was</p>
<p>at once revealed: the oxen had been broken and trained by a man who,</p>
<p>when they were in a pinch, had encouraged them by his frontier</p>
<p>vocabulary, and they could not realize what was expected of them</p>
<p>under extraordinary conditions until they heard familiar and possibly</p>
<p>profanely urgent phrases.  I took the wagon to its destination, but</p>
<p>as it was not brought back, even in all the time I was stationed in</p>
<p>that country, I think comment on the success of my road is</p>
<p>unnecessary.</p>
<p>I spent many happy months at Fort Haskins, remaining there until the</p>
<p>post was nearly completed and its garrison increased by the arrival</p>
<p>of Captain F. T. Dent--a brother-in-law of Captain Ulysses S. Grant--</p>
<p>with his company of the Fourth Infantry, in April, 1857.  In the</p>
<p>summer of 1856, and while I was still on duty there, the Coquille</p>
<p>Indians on the Siletz, and down near the Yaquina Bay, became, on</p>
<p>account of hunger and prospective starvation, very much excited and</p>
<p>exasperated, getting beyond the control of their agent, and even</p>
<p>threatening his life, so a detachment of troops was sent out to set</p>
<p>things to rights, and I took command of it.  I took with me most of</p>
<p>the company, and arrived at Yaquina Bay in time to succor the agent,</p>
<p>who for some days had been besieged in a log hut by the Indians and</p>
<p>had almost abandoned hope of rescue.</p>
<p>Having brought with me over the mountains a few head of beef cattle</p>
<p>for the hungry Indians, without thinking of running any great</p>
<p>personal risk I had six beeves killed some little distance from my</p>
<p>camp, guarding the meat with four Soldiers, whom I was obliged to</p>
<p>post as sentinels around the small area on which the carcasses lay.</p>
<p>The Indians soon formed a circle about the sentinels, and impelled by</p>
<p>starvation, attempted to take the beef before it could be equally</p>
<p>divided.  This was of course resisted, when they drew their knives--</p>
<p>their guns having been previously taken away from them--and some of</p>
<p>the inferior chiefs gave the signal to attack.  The principal chief,</p>
<p>Tetootney John, and two other Indians joined me in the centre of the</p>
<p>circle, and protesting that they would die rather than that the</p>
<p>frenzied onslaught should succeed, harangued the Indians until the</p>
<p>rest of the company hastened up from camp and put an end to the</p>
<p>disturbance.  I always felt grateful to Tetootney John for his</p>
<p>loyalty on this occasion, and many times afterward aided his family</p>
<p>with a little coffee and sugar, but necessarily surreptitiously, so</p>
<p>as not to heighten the prejudices that his friendly act had aroused</p>
<p>among his Indian comrades.</p>
<p>The situation at Yaquina Bay did not seem very safe, notwithstanding</p>
<p>the supply of beef we brought; and the possibility that the starving</p>
<p>Indians might break out was ever present, so to anticipate any</p>
<p>further revolt, I called for more troops.  The request was complied</p>
<p>with by sending to my assistance the greater part of my own company</p>
<p>(&quot;K&quot;)from Fort Yamhill.  The men, inspired by the urgency of our</p>
<p>situation, marched more than forty miles a day, accomplishing the</p>
<p>whole distance in so short a period, that I doubt if the record has</p>
<p>ever been beaten.  When this reinforcement arrived, the Indians saw</p>
<p>the futility of further demonstrations against their agent, who they</p>
<p>seemed to think was responsible for the insufficiency of food, and</p>
<p>managed to exist with the slender rations we could spare and such</p>
<p>indifferent food as they could pick up, until the Indian Department</p>
<p>succeeded in getting up its regular supplies.  In the past the poor</p>
<p>things had often been pinched by hunger and neglect, and at times</p>
<p>their only food was rock oysters, clams and crabs.  Great quantities</p>
<p>of these shell-fish could be gathered in the bay near at hand, but</p>
<p>the mountain Indians, who had heretofore lived on the flesh of</p>
<p>mammal, did not take kindly to mollusks, and, indeed, ate the shell-</p>
<p>fish only as a last resort.</p>
<p>Crab catching at night on the Yaquina Bay by the coast Indians was a</p>
<p>very picturesque scene.  It was mostly done by the squaws and</p>
<p>children, each equipped with a torch in one hand, and a sharp-pointed</p>
<p>stick in the other to take and lift the fish into baskets slung on</p>
<p>the back to receive them.  I have seen at times hundreds of squaws</p>
<p>and children wading about in Yaquina Bay taking crabs in this manner,</p>
<p>and the reflection by the water of the light from the many torches,</p>
<p>with the movements of the Indians while at work, formed a weird and</p>
<p>diverting picture of which we were never tired.</p>
<p>Not long after the arrival of the additional troops from Yamhill, it</p>
<p>became apparent that the number of men at Yaquina Bay would have to</p>
<p>be reduced, so in view of this necessity, it was deemed advisable to</p>
<p>build a block-house for the better protection of the agents and I</p>
<p>looked about for suitable ground on which to erect it.  Nearly all</p>
<p>around the bay the land rose up from the beach very abruptly, and the</p>
<p>only good site that could be found was some level ground used as the</p>
<p>burial-place of the Yaquina Bay Indians--a small band of fish-eating</p>
<p>people who had lived near this point on the coast for ages.  They</p>
<p>were a robust lot, of tall and well-shaped figures, and were called</p>
<p>in the Chinook tongue &quot;salt chuck,&quot; which means fish-eaters, or</p>
<p>eaters of food from the salt water.  Many of the young men and women</p>
<p>were handsome in feature below the forehead, having fine eyes,</p>
<p>aquiline noses and good mouths, but, in conformity with a long-</p>
<p>standing custom, all had flat heads, which gave them a distorted and</p>
<p>hideous appearance, particularly some of the women, who went to the</p>
<p>extreme of fashion and flattened the head to the rear in a sharp</p>
<p>horizontal ridge by confining it between two boards, one running back</p>
<p>from the forehead at an angle of about forty degrees, and the other</p>
<p>up perpendicularly from the back of the neck.  When a head had been</p>
<p>shaped artistically the dusky maiden owner was marked as a belle, and</p>
<p>one could become reconciled to it after a time, but when carelessness</p>
<p>and neglect had governed in the adjustment of the boards, there</p>
<p>probably was nothing in the form of a human being on the face of the</p>
<p>earth that appeared so ugly.</p>
<p>It was the mortuary ground of these Indians that occupied the only</p>
<p>level spot we could get for the block-house.  Their dead were buried</p>
<p>in canoes, which rested in the crotches of forked sticks a few feet</p>
<p>above-ground.  The graveyard was not large, containing probably from</p>
<p>forty to fifty canoes in a fair state of preservation.  According to</p>
<p>the custom of all Indian tribes on the Pacific coast, when one of</p>
<p>their number died all his worldly effects were buried with him, so</p>
<p>that the canoes were filled with old clothes, blankets, pieces of</p>
<p>calico and the like, intended for the use of the departed in the</p>
<p>happy hunting grounds.</p>
<p>I made known to the Indians that we would have to take this piece of</p>
<p>ground for the blockhouse.  They demurred at first, for there is</p>
<p>nothing more painful to an Indian than disturbing his dead, but they</p>
<p>finally consented to hold a council next day on the beach, and thus</p>
<p>come to some definite conclusion.  Next morning they all assembled,</p>
<p>and we talked in the Chinook language all day long, until at last</p>
<p>they gave in, consenting, probably, as much because they could not</p>
<p>help themselves, as for any other reason.  It was agreed that on the</p>
<p>following day at 12 o&#x27;clock, when the tide was going out, I should</p>
<p>take my men and place the canoes in the bay, and let them float out</p>
<p>on the tide across the ocean to the happy hunting-grounds:</p>
<p>At that day there existed in Oregon in vast numbers a species of</p>
<p>wood-rat, and our inspection of the graveyard showed that the canoes</p>
<p>were thickly infested with them.  They were a light gray animal,</p>
<p>larger than the common gray squirrel, with beautiful bushy tails,</p>
<p>which made them strikingly resemble the squirrel, but in cunning and</p>
<p>deviltry they were much ahead of that quick-witted rodent.  I have</p>
<p>known them to empty in one night a keg of spikes in the storehouse in</p>
<p>Yamhill, distributing them along the stringers of the building, with</p>
<p>apparently no other purpose than amusement.  We anticipated great fun</p>
<p>watching the efforts of these rats to escape the next day when the</p>
<p>canoes should be launched on the ocean, and I therefore forbade any</p>
<p>of the command to visit the graveyard in the interim, lest the rats</p>
<p>should be alarmed.  I well knew that they would not be disturbed by</p>
<p>the Indians, who held the sacred spot in awe.  When the work of</p>
<p>taking down the canoes and carrying them to the water began,</p>
<p>expectation was on tiptoe, but, strange as it may seem, not a rat was</p>
<p>to be seen.  This unexpected development was mystifying.  They had</p>
<p>all disappeared; there was not one in any of the canoes, as</p>
<p>investigation proved, for disappointment instigated a most thorough</p>
<p>search.  The Indians said the rats understood Chinook, and that as</p>
<p>they had no wish to accompany the dead across the ocean to the happy</p>
<p>hunting-grounds, they took to the woods for safety.  However that may</p>
<p>be, I have no doubt that the preceding visits to the burial-ground,</p>
<p>and our long talk of the day before, with the unusual stir and</p>
<p>bustle, had so alarmed the rats that, impelled, by their suspicious</p>
<p>instincts, they fled a danger, the nature of which they could not</p>
<p>anticipate, but which they felt to be none the less real and</p>
<p>impending.</p>

<p>INDIANS--CONFLICTING REPORTS OF THE BATTLE OF BULL RUN--SECESSION</p>
<p>QUESTION IN CALIFORNIA--APPOINTED A CAPTAIN--TRANSFERRED TO THE EAST.</p>
<p>The troubles at the Siletz and Yaquina Bay were settled without</p>
<p>further excitement by the arrival in due time of plenty of food, and</p>
<p>as the buildings, at Fort Haskins were so near completion that my</p>
<p>services as quartermaster were no longer needed, I was ordered to</p>
<p>join my own company at Fort Yamhill, where Captain Russell was still</p>
<p>in command.  I returned to that place in May, 1857, and at a period a</p>
<p>little later, in consequence of the close of hostilities in southern</p>
<p>Oregon, the Klamaths and Modocs were sent back to their own country,</p>
<p>to that section in which occurred, in 1873, the disastrous war with</p>
<p>the latter tribe.  This reduced considerably the number of Indians at</p>
<p>the Grande Ronde, but as those remaining were still somewhat unruly,</p>
<p>from the fact that many questions requiring adjustment were</p>
<p>constantly arising between the different bands, the agent and the</p>
<p>officers at the post were kept pretty well occupied.  Captain Russell</p>
<p>assigned to me the special work of keeping up the police control, and</p>
<p>as I had learned at an early day to speak Chinook (the &quot;court</p>
<p>language&quot; among the coast tribes) almost as well as the Indians</p>
<p>themselves, I was thereby enabled to steer my way successfully on</p>
<p>many critical occasions.</p>
<p>For some time the most disturbing and most troublesome element we had</p>
<p>was the Rogue River band.  For three or four years they had fought</p>
<p>our troops obstinately, and surrendered at the bitter end in the</p>
<p>belief that they were merely overpowered, not conquered.  They openly</p>
<p>boasted to the other Indians that they could whip the soldiers, and</p>
<p>that they did not wish to follow the white man&#x27;s ways, continuing</p>
<p>consistently their wild habits, unmindful of all admonitions.</p>
<p>Indeed, they often destroyed their household utensils, tepees and</p>
<p>clothing, and killed their horses on the graves of the dead, in the</p>
<p>fulfillment of a superstitious custom, which demanded that they</p>
<p>should undergo, while mourning for their kindred, the deepest</p>
<p>privation in a property sense.  Everything the loss of which would</p>
<p>make them poor was sacrificed on the graves of their relatives or</p>
<p>distinguished warriors, and as melancholy because of removal from</p>
<p>their old homes caused frequent deaths, there was no lack of occasion</p>
<p>for the sacrifices.  The widows and orphans of the dead warriors were</p>
<p>of course the chief mourners, and exhibited their grief in many</p>
<p>peculiar ways.  I remember one in particular which was universally</p>
<p>practiced by the near kinsfolk.  They would crop their hair very</p>
<p>close, and then cover the head with a sort of hood or plaster of</p>
<p>black pitch, the composition being clay, pulverized charcoal, and the</p>
<p>resinous gum which exudes from the pine-tree.  The hood, nearly an</p>
<p>inch in thickness, was worn during a period of mourning that lasted</p>
<p>through the time it would take nature, by the growth of the hair,</p>
<p>actually to lift from the head the heavy covering of pitch after it</p>
<p>had become solidified and hard as stone.  It must be admitted that</p>
<p>they underwent considerable discomfort in memory of their relatives.</p>
<p>It took all the influence we could bring to bear to break up these</p>
<p>absurdly superstitious practices, and it looked as if no permanent</p>
<p>improvement could be effected, for as soon as we got them to discard</p>
<p>one, another would be invented.  When not allowed to burn down their</p>
<p>tepees or houses, those poor souls who were in a dying condition</p>
<p>would be carried out to the neighboring hillsides just before</p>
<p>dissolution, and there abandoned to their sufferings, with little or</p>
<p>no attention, unless the placing under their heads of a small stick</p>
<p>of wood--with possibly some laudable object, but doubtless great</p>
<p>discomfort to their victim--might be considered such.</p>
<p>To uproot these senseless and monstrous practices was indeed most</p>
<p>difficult.  The most pernicious of all was one which was likely to</p>
<p>bring about tragic results.  They believed firmly in a class of</p>
<p>doctors among their people who professed that they could procure the</p>
<p>illness of an individual at will, and that by certain incantations</p>
<p>they could kill or cure the sick person.  Their faith in this</p>
<p>superstition was so steadfast that there was no doubting its</p>
<p>sincerity, many indulging at times in the most trying privations,</p>
<p>that their relatives might be saved from death at the hands of the</p>
<p>doctors.  I often talked with them on the subject, and tried to</p>
<p>reason them out of the superstitious belief, defying the doctors to</p>
<p>kill me, or even make me ill; but my talks were unavailing, and they</p>
<p>always met my arguments with the remark that I was a white man, of a</p>
<p>race wholly different from the red man, and that that was the reason</p>
<p>the medicine of the doctors would not affect me.  These villainous</p>
<p>doctors might be either men or women, and any one of them finding an</p>
<p>Indian ill, at once averred that his influence was the cause,</p>
<p>offering at the same time to cure the invalid for a fee, which</p>
<p>generally amounted to about all the ponies his family possessed.  If</p>
<p>the proposition was accepted and the fee paid over, the family, in</p>
<p>case the man died, was to have indemnity through the death of the</p>
<p>doctor, who freely promised that they might take his life in such</p>
<p>event, relying on his chances of getting protection from the furious</p>
<p>relatives by fleeing to the military post till time had so assuaged</p>
<p>their grief that matters could be compromised or settled by a</p>
<p>restoration of a part of the property, when the rascally leeches</p>
<p>could again resume their practice.  Of course the services of a</p>
<p>doctor were always accepted when an Indian fell ill; otherwise the</p>
<p>invalid&#x27;s death would surely ensue, brought about by the evil</p>
<p>influence that was unpropitiated.  Latterly it had become quite the</p>
<p>thing, when a patient died, for the doctor to flee to our camp--it</p>
<p>was so convenient and so much safer than elsewhere--and my cellar was</p>
<p>a favorite place of refuge from the infuriated friends of the</p>
<p>deceased.</p>
<p>Among the most notable of these doctors was an Indian named Sam</p>
<p>Patch, who several times sought asylum in any cellar, and being a</p>
<p>most profound diplomat, managed on each occasion and with little</p>
<p>delay to negotiate a peaceful settlement and go forth in safety to</p>
<p>resume the practice of his nefarious profession.  I often hoped he</p>
<p>would be caught before reaching the post, but he seemed to know</p>
<p>intuitively when the time had come to take leg-bail, for his advent</p>
<p>at the garrison generally preceded by but a few hours the death of</p>
<p>some poor dupe.</p>
<p>Finally these peculiar customs brought about the punishment of a</p>
<p>noted doctress of the Rogue River tribe, a woman who was constantly</p>
<p>working in this professional way, and who had found a victim of such</p>
<p>prominence among the Rogue Rivers that his unlooked for death brought</p>
<p>down on her the wrath of all.  She had made him so ill, they</p>
<p>believed, as to bring him to death&#x27;s door notwithstanding the many</p>
<p>ponies that had been given her to cease the incantations, and it was</p>
<p>the conviction of all that she had finally caused the man&#x27;s death</p>
<p>from some ulterior and indiscernible motive.  His relatives and</p>
<p>friends then immediately set about requiting her with the just</p>
<p>penalties of a perfidious breach of contract.  Their threats induced</p>
<p>her instant flight toward my house for the usual protection, but the</p>
<p>enraged friends of the dead man gave hot chase, and overtook the</p>
<p>witch just inside the limits of the garrison, where, on the parade-</p>
<p>ground, in sight of the officers&#x27; quarters, and before any one could</p>
<p>interfere, they killed her.  There were sixteen men in pursuit of the</p>
<p>doctress, and sixteen gun-shot wounds were found in her body when</p>
<p>examined by the surgeon of the post.  The killing of the woman was a</p>
<p>flagrant and defiant outrage committed in the teeth of the military</p>
<p>authority, yet done so quickly that we could not prevent it.  This</p>
<p>necessitated severe measures, both to allay the prevailing excitement</p>
<p>and to preclude the recurrence of such acts.  The body was cared for,</p>
<p>and delivered to the relatives the next day for burial, after which</p>
<p>Captain Russell directed me to take such steps as would put a stop to</p>
<p>the fanatical usages that had brought about this murderous</p>
<p>occurrence, for it was now seen that if timely measures were not</p>
<p>taken to repress them, similar tragedies would surely follow.</p>
<p>Knowing all the men of the Rogue River tribe, and speaking fluently</p>
<p>the Chinook tongue, which they all understood, I went down to their</p>
<p>village the following day, after having sent word to the tribe that I</p>
<p>wished to have a council with them.  The Indians all met me in</p>
<p>council, as I had desired, and I then told them that the men who had</p>
<p>taken part in shooting the woman would have to be delivered up for</p>
<p>punishment.  They were very stiff with me at the interview, and with</p>
<p>all that talent for circumlocution and diplomacy with which the</p>
<p>Indian is lifted, endeavored to evade my demands and delay any</p>
<p>conclusion.  But I was very positive, would hear of no compromise</p>
<p>whatever, and demanded that my terms be at once complied with.  No</p>
<p>one was with me but a sergeant of my company, named Miller, who held</p>
<p>my horse, and as the chances of an agreement began to grow remote, I</p>
<p>became anxious for our safety.  The conversation waxing hot and the</p>
<p>Indians gathering close in around me, I unbuttoned the flap of my</p>
<p>pistol holster, to be ready for any emergency.  When the altercation</p>
<p>became most bitter I put my hand to my hip to draw my pistol, but</p>
<p>discovered it was gone--stolen by one of the rascals surrounding me.</p>
<p>Finding myself unarmed, I modified my tone and manner to correspond</p>
<p>with my helpless condition, thus myself assuming the diplomatic side</p>
<p>in the parley, in order to gain time.  As soon as an opportunity</p>
<p>offered, and I could, without too much loss of self-respect, and</p>
<p>without damaging my reputation among the Indians, I moved out to</p>
<p>where the sergeant held my horse, mounted, and crossing the Yamhill</p>
<p>River close by, called back in Chinook from the farther bank that</p>
<p>&quot;the sixteen men who killed the woman must be delivered up, and my</p>
<p>six-shooter also.&quot; This was responded to by contemptuous laughter, so</p>
<p>I went back to the military post somewhat crestfallen, and made my</p>
<p>report of the turn affairs had taken, inwardly longing for another</p>
<p>chance to bring the rascally Rogue Rivers to terms.</p>
<p>When I had explained the situation to Captain Russell, he thought</p>
<p>that we could not, under any circumstances, overlook this defiant</p>
<p>conduct of the Indians, since, unless summarily punished, it would</p>
<p>lead to even more serious trouble in the future.  I heartily seconded</p>
<p>this proposition, and gladly embracing the opportunity it offered,</p>
<p>suggested that if he would give me another chance, and let me have</p>
<p>the effective force of the garrison, consisting of about fifty men, I</p>
<p>would chastise the Rogue Rivers without fail, and that the next day</p>
<p>was all the time I required to complete arrangements.  He gave me the</p>
<p>necessary authority, and I at once set to work to bring about a</p>
<p>better state of discipline on the reservation, and to put an end to</p>
<p>the practices of the medicine men (having also in view the recovery</p>
<p>of my sixshooter and self-respect), by marching to the village and</p>
<p>taking the rebellious Indians by force.</p>
<p>In the tribe there was an excellent woman called Tighee Mary (Tighee</p>
<p>in Chinook means chief), who by right of inheritance was a kind of</p>
<p>queen of the Rogue Rivers.  Fearing that the insubordinate conduct of</p>
<p>the Indians would precipitate further trouble, she came early the</p>
<p>following morning to see me and tell me of the situation Mary</p>
<p>informed me that she had done all in her power to bring the Indians</p>
<p>to reason, but without avail, and that they were determined to fight</p>
<p>rather than deliver up the sixteen men who had engaged in the</p>
<p>shooting.  She also apprised me of the fact that they had taken up a</p>
<p>position on the Yamhill River, on the direct road between the post</p>
<p>and village, where, painted and armed for war, they were awaiting</p>
<p>attack.</p>
<p>On this information I concluded it would be best to march to the</p>
<p>village by a circuitous route instead of directly, as at first</p>
<p>intended, so I had the ferry-boat belonging to the post floated about</p>
<p>a mile and a half down the Yamhill River and there anchored.  At 11</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock that night I marched my fifty men, out of the garrison, in a</p>
<p>direction opposite to that of the point held by the Indians, and soon</p>
<p>reached the river at the ferryboat.  Here I ferried the party over</p>
<p>with little delay, and marched them along the side of the mountain,</p>
<p>through underbrush and fallen timber, until, just before daylight, I</p>
<p>found that we were immediately in rear of the village, and thence in</p>
<p>rear, also, of the line occupied by the refractory Indians, who were</p>
<p>expecting to meet me on the direct road from the post.  Just at break</p>
<p>of day we made a sudden descent upon the village and took its</p>
<p>occupants completely by surprise, even capturing the chief of the</p>
<p>tribe, &quot;Sam,&quot; who was dressed in all his war toggery, fully armed and</p>
<p>equipped, in anticipation of a fight on the road where his comrades</p>
<p>were in position.  I at once put Sam under guard, giving orders to</p>
<p>kill him instantly if the Indians fired a shot; then forming my line</p>
<p>on the road beyond the edge of the village, in rear of the force</p>
<p>lying in wait for a front attack, we moved forward.  When the hostile</p>
<p>party realized that they were completely cut off from the village,</p>
<p>they came out from their stronghold on the river and took up a line</p>
<p>in my front, distant about sixty yards with the apparent intention of</p>
<p>resisting to the last.</p>
<p>As is usual with Indians when expecting a fight, they were nearly</p>
<p>naked, fantastically painted with blue clay, and hideously arrayed in</p>
<p>war bonnets.  They seemed very belligerent, brandishing their muskets</p>
<p>in the air, dancing on one foot, calling us ugly names, and making</p>
<p>such other demonstrations of hostility, that it seemed at first that</p>
<p>nothing short of the total destruction of the party could bring about</p>
<p>the definite settlement that we were bent on.  Still, as it was my</p>
<p>desire to bring them under subjection without loss of life, if</p>
<p>possible, I determined to see what result would follow when they</p>
<p>learned that their chief was at our mercy.  So, sending Sam under</p>
<p>guard to the front, where he could be seen, informing them that he</p>
<p>would be immediately shot if they fired upon us, and aided by the</p>
<p>cries and lamentations of the women of the village, who deprecated</p>
<p>any hostile action by either party, I soon procured a parley.</p>
<p>The insubordinate Indians were under command of &quot;Joe,&quot; Sam&#x27;s brother,</p>
<p>who at last sent me word that he wanted to see me, and we met between</p>
<p>our, respective lines.  I talked kindly to him, but was firm in my</p>
<p>demand that the men who killed the woman must be given up and my six-</p>
<p>shooter returned.  His reply was he did not think it could be done,</p>
<p>but he would consult his people.  After the consultation, he returned</p>
<p>and notified me that fifteen would surrender and the six-shooter</p>
<p>would be restored, and further, that we could kill the sixteenth man,</p>
<p>since the tribe wished to get rid of him anyhow, adding that he was a</p>
<p>bad Indian, whose bullet no doubt had given the woman her death</p>
<p>wound.  He said that if I assented to this arrangement, he would</p>
<p>require all of his people except the objectionable man to run to the</p>
<p>right of his line at a preconcerted signal.  The bad Indian would be</p>
<p>ordered to stand fast on the extreme left, and we could open fire on</p>
<p>him as his comrades fell away to the right.  I agreed to the</p>
<p>proposition, and gave Joe fifteen minutes to execute his part of it.</p>
<p>We then returned to our respective forces, and a few minutes later</p>
<p>the fifteen ran to the right flank as agreed upon, and we opened fire</p>
<p>on the one Indian left standing alone, bringing him down in his</p>
<p>tracks severely wounded by a shot through the shoulder.</p>
<p>While all this was going on, the other bands of the reservation,</p>
<p>several thousand strong, had occupied the surrounding hills for the</p>
<p>purpose of witnessing the fight, for as the Rogue Rivers had been</p>
<p>bragging for some time that they could whip the soldiers, these other</p>
<p>Indians had come out to see it done.  The result, however,</p>
<p>disappointed the spectators, and the Rogue Rivers naturally lost</p>
<p>caste.  The fifteen men now came in and laid down their arms</p>
<p>(including my six-shooter) in front of us as agreed, but I compelled</p>
<p>them to take the surrendered guns up again and carry them to the</p>
<p>post, where they were deposited in the block-house for future</p>
<p>security.  The prisoners were ironed with ball and chain, and made to</p>
<p>work at the post until their rebellious spirit was broken; and the</p>
<p>wounded man was correspondingly punished after he had fully</p>
<p>recovered.  An investigation as to why this man had been selected as</p>
<p>the offering by which Joe and his companions expected to gain</p>
<p>immunity, showed that the fellow was really a most worthless</p>
<p>character, whose death even would have been a benefit to the tribe.</p>
<p>Thus it seemed that they had two purposes in view--the one to</p>
<p>propitiate me and get good terms, the other to rid themselves of a</p>
<p>vagabond member of the tribe.</p>
<p>The punishment of these sixteen Indians by ball and chain ended all</p>
<p>trouble with the Rogue River tribe.  The, disturbances arising from</p>
<p>the incantations of the doctors and doctresses, and the practice of</p>
<p>killing horses and burning all worldly property on the graves of</p>
<p>those who died, were completely suppressed, and we made with little</p>
<p>effort a great stride toward the civilization of these crude and</p>
<p>superstitious people, for they now began to recognize the power of</p>
<p>the Government.  In their management afterward a course of justice</p>
<p>and mild force was adopted, and unvaryingly applied.  They were</p>
<p>compelled to cultivate their land, to attend church, and to send</p>
<p>their children to school.  When I saw them, fifteen years later,</p>
<p>transformed into industrious and substantial farmers, with neat</p>
<p>houses, fine cattle, wagons and horses, carrying their grain, eggs,</p>
<p>and butter to market and bringing home flour, coffee, sugar, and</p>
<p>calico in return, I found abundant confirmation of my early opinion</p>
<p>that the most effectual measures for lifting them from a state of</p>
<p>barbarism would be a practical supervision at the outset, coupled</p>
<p>with a firm control and mild discipline.</p>
<p>In all that was done for these Indians Captain Russell&#x27;s judgment and</p>
<p>sound, practical ideas were the inspiration.  His true manliness,</p>
<p>honest and just methods, together with the warm-hearted interest he</p>
<p>took in all that pertained to matters of duty to his Government,</p>
<p>could not have produced other than the best results, in what position</p>
<p>soever he might have been placed.  As all the lovable traits of his</p>
<p>character were constantly manifested, I became most deeply attached</p>
<p>to him, and until the day of his death in 1864, on the battle-field</p>
<p>of Opequan, in front of Winchester, while gallantly leading his</p>
<p>division under my command, my esteem and affection were sustained and</p>
<p>intensified by the same strong bonds that drew me to him in these</p>
<p>early days in Oregon.</p>
<p>After the events just narrated I continued on duty at the post of</p>
<p>Yamhill, experiencing the usual routine of garrison life without any</p>
<p>incidents of much interest, down to the breaking out of the war of</p>
<p>the rebellion in April, 1861.  The news of the firing on Fort Sumter</p>
<p>brought us an excitement which overshadowed all else, and though we</p>
<p>had no officers at the post who sympathized with the rebellion, there</p>
<p>were several in our regiment--the Fourth Infantry--who did, and we</p>
<p>were considerably exercised as to the course they might pursue, but</p>
<p>naturally far more so concerning the disposition that would be made</p>
<p>of the regiment during the conflict.</p>
<p>In due time orders came for the regiment to go East, and my company</p>
<p>went off, leaving me, however--a second lieutenant--in command of the</p>
<p>post until I should be relieved by Captain James J. Archer, of the</p>
<p>Ninth Infantry, whose company was to take the place of the old</p>
<p>garrison.  Captain Archer, with his company of the Ninth, arrived</p>
<p>shortly after, but I had been notified that he intended to go South,</p>
<p>and his conduct was such after reaching the post that I would not</p>
<p>turn over the command to him for fear he might commit some rebellious</p>
<p>act.  Thus a more prolonged detention occurred than I had at first</p>
<p>anticipated.  Finally the news came that he had tendered his</p>
<p>resignation and been granted a leave of absence for sixty days.  On</p>
<p>July 17 he took his departure, but I continued in command till</p>
<p>September 1, when Captain Philip A. Owen, of the Ninth Infantry,</p>
<p>arrived and, taking charge, gave me my release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the day we received the news of the firing on Sumter until I</p>
</blockquote>
<p>started East, about the first of September, 1861, I was deeply</p>
<p>solicitous as to the course of events, and though I felt confident</p>
<p>that in the end the just cause of the Government must triumph, yet</p>
<p>the thoroughly crystallized organization which the Southern</p>
<p>Confederacy quickly exhibited disquieted me very much, for it alone</p>
<p>was evidence that the Southern leaders had long anticipated the</p>
<p>struggle and prepared for it.  It was very difficult to obtain direct</p>
<p>intelligence of the progress of the war.  Most of the time we were in</p>
<p>the depths of ignorance as to the true condition of affairs, and this</p>
<p>tended to increase our anxiety.  Then, too, the accounts of the</p>
<p>conflicts that had taken place were greatly exaggerated by the</p>
<p>Eastern papers, and lost nothing in transition.  The news came by the</p>
<p>pony express across the Plains to San Francisco, where it was still</p>
<p>further magnified in republishing, and gained somewhat in Southern</p>
<p>bias.  I remember well that when the first reports reached us of, the</p>
<p>battle of Bull Run--that sanguinary engagement--it was stated that</p>
<p>each side had lost forty thousand men in killed and wounded, and none</p>
<p>were reported missing nor as having run away.  Week by week these</p>
<p>losses grew less, until they finally shrunk into the hundreds, but</p>
<p>the vivid descriptions of the gory conflict were not toned down</p>
<p>during the whole summer.</p>
<p>We received our mail at Yamhill only once a week, and then had to</p>
<p>bring it from Portland, Oregon, by express.  On the day of the week</p>
<p>that our courier, or messenger, was expected back from Portland, I</p>
<p>would go out early in the morning to a commanding point above the</p>
<p>post, from which I could see a long distance down the road as it ran</p>
<p>through the valley of the Yamhill, and there I would watch with</p>
<p>anxiety for his coming, longing for good news; for, isolated as I had</p>
<p>been through years spent in the wilderness, my patriotism was</p>
<p>untainted by politics, nor had it been disturbed by any discussion of</p>
<p>the questions out of which the war grew, and I hoped for the success</p>
<p>of the Government above all other considerations.  I believe I was</p>
<p>also uninfluenced by any thoughts of the promotion that might result</p>
<p>to me from the conflict, but, out of a sincere desire to contribute</p>
<p>as much as I could to the preservation of the Union, I earnestly</p>
<p>wished to be at the seat of war, and feared it might end before I</p>
<p>could get East.  In no sense did I anticipate what was to happen to</p>
<p>me afterward, nor that I was to gain any distinction from it.  I was</p>
<p>ready to do my duty to the best of my ability wherever I might be</p>
<p>called, and I was young, healthy, insensible to fatigue, and desired</p>
<p>opportunity, but high rank was so distant in our service that not a</p>
<p>dream of its attainment had flitted through my brain.</p>
<p>During the period running from January to September, 1861, in</p>
<p>consequence of resignations and the addition of some new regiments to</p>
<p>the regular army, I had passed through the grade of first lieutenant</p>
<p>and reached that of captain in the Thirteenth United States Infantry,</p>
<p>of which General W. T. Sherman had recently been made the colonel.</p>
<p>When relieved from further duty at Yamhill by Captain Owen, I left</p>
<p>for the Atlantic coast to join my new regiment.  A two days&#x27; ride</p>
<p>brought me down to Portland, whence I sailed to San Franciso, and at</p>
<p>that city took passage by steamer for New York via the Isthmus of</p>
<p>Panama, in company with a number of officers who were coming East</p>
<p>under circumstances like my own.</p>
<p>At this time California was much agitated--on the question of</p>
<p>secession, and the secession element was so strong that considerable</p>
<p>apprehension was felt by the Union people lest the State might be</p>
<p>carried into the Confederacy.  As a consequence great distrust</p>
<p>existed in all quarters, and the loyal passengers on the steamer, not</p>
<p>knowing what might occur during our voyage, prepared to meet</p>
<p>emergencies by thoroughly organizing to frustrate any attempt that</p>
<p>might possibly be made to carry us into some Southern port after we</p>
<p>should leave Aspinwall.  However, our fears proved groundless; at all</p>
<p>events, no such attempt was made, and we reached New York in safety</p>
<p>in November, 1861.  A day or two in New York sufficed to replenish a</p>
<p>most meagre wardrobe, and I then started West to join my new</p>
<p>regiment, stopping a day and a night at the home of my parents in</p>
<p>Ohio, where I had not been since I journeyed from Texas for the</p>
<p>Pacific coast.  The headquarters of my regiment were at Jefferson</p>
<p>Barracks, Missouri, to which point I proceeded with no further delay</p>
<p>except a stay in the city of St. Louis long enough to pay my respects</p>
<p>to General H. W. Halleck.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<p>AUDITING ACCOUNTS--CHIEF QUARTERMASTER AND COMMISSARY OF THE ARMY OF</p>
<p>SOUTHWEST MISSOURI--PREPARING FOR THE PEA RIDGE CAMPAIGN--A</p>
<p>DIFFERENCE WITH GENERAL CURTIS--ORDERED TO THE FRONT--APPOINTED A</p>
<p>COLONEL.</p>
<p>Some days after I had reached the headquarters of my regiment near</p>
<p>St. Louis, General Halleck sent for me, and when I reported he</p>
<p>informed me that there existed a great deal of confusion regarding</p>
<p>the accounts of some of the disbursing officers in his department,</p>
<p>whose management of its fiscal affairs under his predecessor, General</p>
<p>John C. Fremont, had been very loose; and as the chaotic condition of</p>
<p>things could be relieved only by auditing these accounts, he</p>
<p>therefore had determined to create a board of officers for the</p>
<p>purpose, and intended to make me president of it.  The various</p>
<p>transactions in question covered a wide field, for the department</p>
<p>embraced the States of Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Arkansas,</p>
<p>and all of Kentucky west of the Cumberland River.</p>
<p>The duty was not distasteful, and I felt that I was qualified to</p>
<p>undertake it, for the accounts to be audited belonged exclusively to</p>
<p>the Quartermaster and Subsistence departments, and by recent</p>
<p>experience I had become familiar with the class of papers that</p>
<p>pertained to those branches of the army.  Indeed, it was my</p>
<p>familiarity with such transactions, returns, etc., that probably</p>
<p>caused my selection as president of the board.</p>
<p>I entered upon the work forthwith, and continued at it until the 26th</p>
<p>of December, 1861.  At that date I was relieved from the auditing</p>
<p>board and assigned to duty as Chief Commissary of the Army of</p>
<p>Southwest Missouri, commanded by General Samuel R. Curtis.  This army</p>
<p>was then organizing at Rolla, Missouri, for the Pea Ridge campaign,</p>
<p>its strength throughout the campaign being in the aggregate about</p>
<p>fifteen thousand men.</p>
<p>As soon as I received information of my selection for this position,</p>
<p>I went to General Halleck and requested him to assign me as Chief</p>
<p>Quartermaster also.  He was reluctant to do so, saying that I could</p>
<p>not perform both duties, but I soon convinced him that I could do</p>
<p>both better than the one, for I reminded him that as Chief</p>
<p>Quartermaster I should control the transportation, and thus obviate</p>
<p>all possible chances of discord between the two staff departments; a</p>
<p>condition which I deemed essential to success, especially as it was</p>
<p>intended that Curtis&#x27;s army should mainly subsist on the country.</p>
<p>This argument impressed Halleck, and becoming convinced, he promptly</p>
<p>issued the order making me Chief Quartermaster and Chief Commissary</p>
<p>of Subsistence of the Army of Southwest Missouri, and I started for</p>
<p>Rolla to enter upon the work assigned me.</p>
<p>Having reported to General Curtis, I quickly learned that his system</p>
<p>of supply was very defective, and the transportation without proper</p>
<p>organization, some of the regiments having forty to fifty wagon each,</p>
<p>and others only three or four.  I labored day and night to remedy</p>
<p>these and other defects, and with the help of Captain Michael P.</p>
<p>Small, of the Subsistence Department, who was an invaluable</p>
<p>assistant, soon brought things into shape, putting the transportation</p>
<p>in good working order, giving each regiment its proper quota of</p>
<p>wagons, and turning the surplus into the general supply trains of the</p>
<p>army.  In accomplishing this I was several times on the verge of</p>
<p>personal conflict with irate regimental commanders, but Colonel G. M.</p>
<p>Dodge so greatly sustained me with General Curtis by strong moral</p>
<p>support, and by such efficient details from his regiment--the Fourth</p>
<p>Iowa Volunteer Infantry--that I still bear him and it great affection</p>
<p>and lasting gratitude.</p>
<p>On January 26, 1862, General Curtis&#x27;s army began its march from Rolla</p>
<p>to Springfield, Missouri, by way of Lebanon.  The roads were deep</p>
<p>with mud, and so badly cut up that the supply trains in moving</p>
<p>labored under the most serious difficulties, and were greatly</p>
<p>embarrassed by swollen streams.  Under these circumstances many</p>
<p>delays occurred, and when we arrived at Lebanon nearly all the</p>
<p>supplies with which we had started had been consumed, and the work of</p>
<p>feeding the troops off the country had to begin at that point.  To</p>
<p>get flour, wheat had to be taken from the stacks, threshed, and sent</p>
<p>to the mills to be ground.  Wheat being scarce in this region, corn</p>
<p>as a substitute had to be converted into meal by the same laborious</p>
<p>process.  In addition, beef cattle had to be secured for the meat</p>
<p>ration.</p>
<p>By hard work we soon accumulated a sufficient quantity of flour and</p>
<p>corn meal to justify the resumption of our march on Springfield; at</p>
<p>or near which point the enemy was believed to be awaiting us, and the</p>
<p>order was given to move forward, the commanding general cautioning</p>
<p>me, in the event of disaster, to let no salt fall into General</p>
<p>Price&#x27;s hands.  General Curtis made a hobby of this matter of salt,</p>
<p>believing the enemy was sadly in need of that article, and he</p>
<p>impressed me deeply with his conviction that our cause would be</p>
<p>seriously injured by a loss which would inure so greatly and</p>
<p>peculiarly to the enemy&#x27;s benefit; but we afterward discovered, when</p>
<p>Price abandoned his position, that about all he left behind was salt.</p>
<p>When we were within about eight miles of Springfield, General Curtis</p>
<p>decided to put his troops in line of battle for the advance on the</p>
<p>town, and directed me to stretch out my supply trains in a long line</p>
<p>of battle, so that in falling back, in case the troops were repulsed,</p>
<p>he could rally the men on the wagons.  I did not like the tactics,</p>
<p>but of course obeyed the order.  The line moved on Springfield, and</p>
<p>took the town without resistance, the enemy having fled southward, in</p>
<p>the direction of Pea Ridge, the preceding day.  Of course our success</p>
<p>relieved my anxiety about the wagons; but fancy has often pictured</p>
<p>since, the stampede of six mule teams that, had we met with any</p>
<p>reverse, would have taken place over the prairies of southwest</p>
<p>Missouri.</p>
<p>The army set out in pursuit of Price, but I was left at Springfield</p>
<p>to gather supplies from the surrounding country, by the same means</p>
<p>that had been used at Lebanon, and send them forward.  To succeed in</p>
<p>this useful and necessary duty required much hard work.  To procure</p>
<p>the grain and to run the mills in the country, replacing the</p>
<p>machinery where parts had been carried away, or changing the</p>
<p>principle and running the mills on some different plan when</p>
<p>necessary, and finally forward the product to the army, made a task</p>
<p>that taxed the energy of all engaged in it.  Yet, having at command a</p>
<p>very skillful corps of millwrights, machinists, and millers, detailed</p>
<p>principally from the Fourth Iowa and Thirty-sixth Illinois volunteer</p>
<p>regiments, we soon got matters in shape, and were able to send such</p>
<p>large quantities of flour and meal to the front, that only the bacon</p>
<p>and small parts of the ration had to be brought forward from our</p>
<p>depot at Rolla.  When things were well systematized, I went forward</p>
<p>myself to expedite the delivery of supplies, and joined the army at</p>
<p>Cross Hollows, just south of Pea Ridge.</p>
<p>Finding everything working well at Cross Hollows, I returned to</p>
<p>Springfield in a few days to continue the labor of collecting</p>
<p>supplies.  On my way back I put the mills at Cassville in good order</p>
<p>to grind the grain in that vicinity, and perfected there a plan for</p>
<p>the general supply from the neighboring district of both the men and</p>
<p>animals of the army, so that there should, be no chance of a failure</p>
<p>of the campaign from bad roads or disaster to my trains.  Springfield</p>
<p>thus became the centre of the entire supply section.</p>
<p>Just after my return to Springfield the battle of Pea Ridge was</p>
<p>fought.  The success of the Union troops in this battle was</p>
<p>considerable, and while not of sufficient magnitude to affect the</p>
<p>general cause materially, it was decisive as to that particular</p>
<p>campaign, and resulted in driving all organized Confederate forces</p>
<p>out of the State of Missouri.  After Pea Ridge was won, certain</p>
<p>efforts were made to deprive Curtis of the credit due him for the</p>
<p>victory; but, no matter what merit belonged to individual commanders,</p>
<p>I was always convinced that Curtis was deserving of the highest</p>
<p>commendation, not only for the skill displayed on the field, but for</p>
<p>a zeal and daring in campaign which was not often exhibited at that</p>
<p>early period of the war.  Especially should this credit be awarded</p>
<p>him, when we consider the difficulties under which he labored, how he</p>
<p>was hampered in having to depend on a sparsely settled country for</p>
<p>the subsistence of his troops.  In the reports of the battle that</p>
<p>came to Springfield, much glory was claimed for some other general</p>
<p>officers, but as I had control of the telegraph line from Springfield</p>
<p>east, I detained all despatches until General Curtis had sent in his</p>
<p>official report.  He thus had the opportunity of communicating with</p>
<p>his superior in advance of some of his vain subordinates, who would</p>
<p>have laid claim to the credit of the battle had I not thwarted them</p>
<p>by this summary means.</p>
<p>Not long afterward came the culmination of a little difference that</p>
<p>had arisen between General Curtis and me, brought about, I have since</p>
<p>sometimes thought, by an assistant quartermaster from Iowa, whom I</p>
<p>had on duty with me at Springfield.  He coveted my place, and finally</p>
<p>succeeded in getting it.  He had been an unsuccessful banker in Iowa,</p>
<p>and early in the war obtained an appointment as assistant</p>
<p>quartermaster of volunteers with the rank of captain.  As chief</p>
<p>quartermaster of the army in Missouri, there would be opportunities</p>
<p>for the recuperation of his fortunes which would not offer to one in</p>
<p>a subordinate place; so to gain this position he doubtless intrigued</p>
<p>for it while under my eye, and Curtis was induced to give it to him</p>
<p>as soon as I was relieved.  His career as my successor, as well as in</p>
<p>other capacities in which he was permitted to act during the war, was</p>
<p>to say the least not savory.  The war over he turned up in Chicago as</p>
<p>president of a bank, which he wrecked; and he finally landed in the</p>
<p>penitentiary for stealing a large sum of money from the United States</p>
<p>Treasury at Washington while employed there as a clerk.  The chances</p>
<p>that this man&#x27;s rascality would be discovered were much less when</p>
<p>chief of the departments of transportation and supply of an army than</p>
<p>they afterward proved to be in the Treasury.  I had in my possession</p>
<p>at all times large sums of money for the needs of the army, and among</p>
<p>other purposes for which these funds were to be disbursed was the</p>
<p>purchase of horses and mules.  Certain officers and men more devoted</p>
<p>to gain than to the performance of duty (a few such are always to be</p>
<p>found in armies) quickly learned this, and determined to profit by</p>
<p>it.  Consequently they began a regular system of stealing horses from</p>
<p>the people of the country and proffering them to me for purchase.  It</p>
<p>took but a little time to discover this roguery, and when I became</p>
<p>satisfied of their knavery I brought it to a sudden close by seizing</p>
<p>the horses as captured property, branding them U. S., and refusing to</p>
<p>pay for them.  General Curtis, misled by the misrepresentations that</p>
<p>had been made, and without fully knowing the circumstances, or</p>
<p>realizing to what a base and demoralizing state of things this course</p>
<p>was inevitably tending, practically ordered me to make the Payments,</p>
<p>and I refused.  The immediate result of this disobedience was a</p>
<p>court-martial to try me; and knowing that my usefulness in that army</p>
<p>was gone, no matter what the outcome of the trial might be, I asked</p>
<p>General Halleck to relieve me from duty with General Curtis and order</p>
<p>me to St. Louis.  This was promptly done, and as my connection with</p>
<p>the Army of Southwest Missouri was thus severed before the court</p>
<p>could be convened, my case never came to trial.  The man referred to</p>
<p>as being the cause of this condition of affairs was appointed by</p>
<p>General Curtis to succeed me.  I turned over to the former all the</p>
<p>funds and property for which I was responsible, also the branded</p>
<p>horses and mules stolen from the people of the country, requiring</p>
<p>receipts for everything.  I heard afterward that some of the blooded</p>
<p>stock of southwest Missouri made its way to Iowa in an unaccountable</p>
<p>manner, but whether the administration of my successor was</p>
<p>responsible for it or not I am unable to say.</p>
<p>On my arrival at St. Louis I felt somewhat forlorn and disheartened</p>
<p>at the turn affairs had taken.  I did not know where I should be</p>
<p>assigned, nor what I should be required to do, but these</p>
<p>uncertainties were dispelled in a few days by General Halleck, who,</p>
<p>being much pressed by the Governors of some of the Western States to</p>
<p>disburse money in their sections, sent me out into the Northwest with</p>
<p>a sort of roving commission to purchase horses for the use of the</p>
<p>army.  I went to Madison and Racine, Wis., at which places I bought</p>
<p>two hundred horses, which were shipped to St. Louis.  At Chicago I</p>
<p>bought two hundred more, and as the prices paid at the latter point</p>
<p>showed that Illinois was the cheapest market--it at that time</p>
<p>producing a surplus over home demands--I determined to make Chicago</p>
<p>the centre of my operations.</p>
<p>While occupied in this way at Chicago the battle of Shiloh took</p>
<p>place, and the desire for active service with troops became uppermost</p>
<p>in my thoughts, so I returned to St. Louis to see if I could not get</p>
<p>into the field.  General Halleck having gone down to the Shiloh</p>
<p>battle-field, I reported to his Assistant Adjutant-General, Colonel</p>
<p>John C. Kelton, and told him of my anxiety to take a hand in active</p>
<p>field-service, adding that I did not wish to join my regiment, which</p>
<p>was still organizing and recruiting at Jefferson Barracks, for I felt</p>
<p>confident I could be more useful elsewhere.  Kelton knew that the</p>
<p>purchasing duty was but temporary, and that on its completion,</p>
<p>probably at no distant date, I should have to join my company at the</p>
<p>barracks; so, realizing the inactivity to which that situation of</p>
<p>affairs would subject me, he decided to assume the responsibility of</p>
<p>sending me to report to General Halleck at Shiloh, and gave me an</p>
<p>order to that effect.</p>
<p>This I consider the turning-point in my military career, and shall</p>
<p>always feel grateful to Colonel Kelton for his kindly act which so</p>
<p>greatly influenced my future.  My desire to join the army at Shiloh</p>
<p>had now taken possession of me, and I was bent on getting there by</p>
<p>the first means available.  Learning that a hospital-boat under</p>
<p>charge of Dr. Hough was preparing to start for Pittsburg Landing, I</p>
<p>obtained the Doctor&#x27;s consent to take passage on it, and on the</p>
<p>evening of April 15, I left St. Louis for the scene of military</p>
<p>operations in northeastern Mississippi.</p>
<p>At Pittsburg Landing I reported to General Halleck, who, after some</p>
<p>slight delay, assigned me to duty as an assistant to Colonel George</p>
<p>Thom, of the topographical engineers.  Colonel Thom put me at the</p>
<p>work of getting the trains up from the landing, which involved the</p>
<p>repair of roads for that purpose by corduroying the marshy places.</p>
<p>This was rough, hard work, without much chance of reward, but it, was</p>
<p>near the field of active operations, and I determined to do the best</p>
<p>I could at it till opportunity for something better might arise.</p>
<p>General Halleck did not know much about taking care of himself in the</p>
<p>field.  His camp arrangements were wholly inadequate, and in</p>
<p>consequence he and all the officers about him were subjected to much</p>
<p>unnecessary discomfort and annoyance.  Someone suggested to him to</p>
<p>appoint me quartermaster for his headquarters, with a view to</p>
<p>systematizing the establishment and remedying the defects complained</p>
<p>of, and I was consequently assigned to this duty.  Shortly after this</p>
<p>assignment I had the satisfaction of knowing that General Halleck was</p>
<p>delighted with the improvements made at headquarters, both in camp</p>
<p>outfit and transportation, and in administration generally.  My</p>
<p>popularity grew as the improvements increased, but one trifling</p>
<p>incident came near marring it.  There was some hitch about getting</p>
<p>fresh beef for General Halleck&#x27;s mess, and as by this time everybody</p>
<p>had come to look to me for anything and everything in the way of</p>
<p>comfort, Colonel Joe McKibben brought an order from the General for</p>
<p>me to get fresh beef for the headquarters mess.  I was not caterer</p>
<p>for this mess, nor did I belong to it even, so I refused point-blank.</p>
<p>McKibben, disliking to report my disobedience, undertook persuasion,</p>
<p>and brought Colonel Thom to see me to aid in his negotiations, but I</p>
<p>would not give in, so McKibben in the kindness of his heart rode</p>
<p>several miles in order to procure the beef himself, and thus save me</p>
<p>from the dire results which be thought would follow should Halleck</p>
<p>get wind of such downright insubordination.  The next day I was made</p>
<p>Commissary of Subsistence for the headquarters in addition to my</p>
<p>other duties, and as this brought me into the line of fresh beef,</p>
<p>General Halleck had no cause thereafter to complain of a scarcity of</p>
<p>that article in his mess.</p>
<p>My stay at General Halleck&#x27;s headquarters was exceedingly agreeable,</p>
<p>and my personal intercourse with officers on duty there was not only</p>
<p>pleasant and instructive, but offered opportunities for improvement</p>
<p>and advancement for which hardly any other post could have afforded</p>
<p>like chances.  My special duties did not occupy all my time, and</p>
<p>whenever possible I used to go over to General Sherman&#x27;s division,</p>
<p>which held the extreme right of our line in the advance on Corinth,</p>
<p>to witness the little engagements occurring there continuously during</p>
<p>the slow progress which the army was then making, the enemy being</p>
<p>forced back but a short distance each day.  I knew General Sherman</p>
<p>very well.  We came from near the same section of country in Ohio,</p>
<p>and his wife and her family had known me from childhood.  I was</p>
<p>always kindly received by the General, and one day he asked me if I</p>
<p>would be willing to accept the colonelcy of a certain Ohio regiment</p>
<p>if he secured the appointment.  I gladly told him yes, if General</p>
<p>Halleck would let me go; but I was doomed to disappointment, for in</p>
<p>about a week or so afterward General Sherman informed me that the</p>
<p>Governor of Ohio would not consent, having already decided to appoint</p>
<p>some one else.</p>
<p>A little later Governor Blair, of Michigan, who was with the army</p>
<p>temporarily in the interest of the troops from his State, and who</p>
<p>just at this time was looking around for a colonel for the Second</p>
<p>Michigan Cavalry, and very anxious to get a regular officer, fixed</p>
<p>upon me as the man.  The regiment was then somewhat run down by</p>
<p>losses from sickness, and considerably split into factions growing</p>
<p>out of jealousies engendered by local differences previous to</p>
<p>organization, and the Governor desired to bridge over all these</p>
<p>troubles by giving the regiment a commander who knew nothing about</p>
<p>them.  I presume that some one said to the Governor about this time,</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#x27;t you get Sheridan?&quot;  This, however, is only conjecture.  I</p>
<p>really do not know how my name was proposed to him, but I have often</p>
<p>been told since that General Gordon Granger, whom I knew slightly</p>
<p>then, and who had been the former colonel of the regiment, first</p>
<p>suggested the appointment.  At all events, on the morning of May 27,</p>
<p>1862, Captain Russell A. Alger--recently Governor of Michigan--</p>
<p>accompanied by the quartermaster of the regiment, Lieutenant Frank</p>
<p>Walbridge, arrived at General Halleck&#x27;s headquarters and delivered to</p>
<p>me this telegram:</p>
<p>(By Telegraph.)</p>
<p>&quot;MILITARY DEPT OF MICHIGAN,</p>
<p>&quot;ADJUTANT-GENERAL&#x27;S OFFICE,</p>
<p>&quot;DETROIT, May 25, 1862.</p>
<p>GENERAL ORDERS NO. 148.</p>
<p>&quot;Captain Philip H. Sheridan, U. S. Army, is hereby appointed</p>
<p>Colonel of the Second Regiment Michigan Cavalry, to rank from</p>
<p>this date.</p>
<p>&quot;Captain Sheridan will immediately assume command of the</p>
<p>regiment.</p>
<p>&quot;By order of the Commander-in-Chief,</p>
<p>&quot;JNO. ROBERTSON,</p>
<p>&quot;Adjutant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>I took the order to General Halleck, and said that I would like to</p>
<p>accept, but he was not willing I should do so until the consent of</p>
<p>the War Department could be obtained.  I returned to my tent much</p>
<p>disappointed, for in those days, for some unaccountable reason, the</p>
<p>War Department did not favor the appointment of regular officers to</p>
<p>volunteer regiments, and I feared a disapproval at Washington.  After</p>
<p>a further consultation with Captain Alger and Lieutenant Walbridge, I</p>
<p>determined to go to the General again and further present the case.</p>
<p>Enlarging on my desire for active service with troops, and urging the</p>
<p>utter lack of such opportunity where I was, I pleaded my cause until</p>
<p>General Halleck finally resolved to take the responsibility of</p>
<p>letting me go without consulting the War Department.  When I had</p>
<p>thanked him for the kindness, he said that inasmuch as I was to leave</p>
<p>him, he would inform me that the regiment to which I had just been</p>
<p>appointed was ordered out as part of a column directed to make a raid</p>
<p>to the south of the enemy, then occupying Corinth, and that if I</p>
<p>could turn over my property, it would probably be well for me to join</p>
<p>my command immediately, so that I could go with the expedition.  I</p>
<p>returned to my tent, where Alger and Walbridge were still waiting,</p>
<p>and told them of the success of my interview, at the same time</p>
<p>notifying them that I would join the regiment in season to accompany</p>
<p>the expedition of which Halleck had spoken.</p>
<p>In the course of the afternoon I turned over all my property to my</p>
<p>successor, and about 8 o&#x27;clock that evening made my appearance at the</p>
<p>camp of the Second Michigan Cavalry, near Farmington, Mississippi.</p>
<p>The regiment was in a hubbub of excitement making preparations for</p>
<p>the raid, and I had barely time to meet the officers of my command,</p>
<p>and no opportunity at all to see the men, when the trumpet sounded to</p>
<p>horse.  Dressed in a coat and trousers of a captain of infantry, but</p>
<p>recast as a colonel of cavalry by a pair of well-worn eagles that</p>
<p>General Granger had kindly given me, I hurriedly placed on my saddle</p>
<p>a haversack, containing some coffee, sugar, bacon, and hard bread,</p>
<p>which had been prepared, and mounting my horse, I reported my</p>
<p>regiment to the brigade commander as ready for duty.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<p>EXPEDITION TO BOONEVILLE--DESTROYING SUPPLIES--CONFEDERATE</p>
<p>STRAGGLERS--SUCCESS OF THE EXPEDITION--A RECONNOISSANCE--THE</p>
<p>IMPORTANCE OF BODILY SUSTENANCE--THE BATTLE OF BOONEVILLE--</p>
<p>RECOMMENDED FOR APPOINTMENT AS A BRIGADIER-GENERAL.</p>
<p>The expedition referred to by General Halleck in his parting</p>
<p>conversation was composed of the Second Michigan and Second Iowa</p>
<p>regiments of cavalry, formed into a brigade under command of Colonel</p>
<p>Washington L. Elliott, of the Second Iowa.  It was to start on the</p>
<p>night of the 27th of May at 12 o&#x27;clock, and proceed by a circuitous</p>
<p>route through Iuka, Miss., to Booneville, a station on the Mobile and</p>
<p>Ohio Railroad, about twenty-two miles below Corinth, and accomplish</p>
<p>all it could in the way of destroying the enemy&#x27;s supplies and</p>
<p>cutting his railroad communications.</p>
<p>The weather in that climate was already warm, guides unobtainable,</p>
<p>and both men and horses suffered much discomfort from the heat, and</p>
<p>fatigue from the many delays growing out of the fact that we were in</p>
<p>almost total ignorance of the roads leading to the point that we</p>
<p>desired to reach.  In order that we might go light we carried only</p>
<p>sugar, coffee, and salt, depending on the country for meat and bread.</p>
<p>Both these articles were scarce, but I think we got all there was,</p>
<p>for our advent was so unexpected by the people of the region through</p>
<p>which we passed that, supposing us to be Confederate cavalry, they</p>
<p>often gave us all they had, the women and servants contributing most</p>
<p>freely from their, reserve stores.</p>
<p>Before reaching Booneville I had the advance, but just as we arrived</p>
<p>on the outskirts of the town the brigade was formed with the Second</p>
<p>Iowa on my right, and the whole force moved forward, right in front,</p>
<p>preceded by skirmishers.  Here we encountered the enemy, but forced</p>
<p>him back with little resistance.  When we had gained possession of</p>
<p>the station, Colonel Elliott directed me to take the left wing of my</p>
<p>regiment, pass to the south, and destroy a bridge or culvert supposed</p>
<p>to be at a little distance below the town on the Mobile and Ohio</p>
<p>Railroad.  The right wing, or other half of the regiment, was to be</p>
<p>held in reserve for my support if necessary.  I moved rapidly in the</p>
<p>designated direction till I reached the railroad, and then rode down</p>
<p>it for a mile and a half, but found neither bridge nor culvert.  I</p>
<p>then learned that there was no bridge of any importance except the</p>
<p>one at Baldwin, nine miles farther down, but as I was aware, from</p>
<p>information recently received, that it was defended by three</p>
<p>regiments and a battery, I concluded that I could best accomplish the</p>
<p>purpose for which I had been detached--crippling the road--by tearing</p>
<p>up the track, bending the rails, and burning the cross-ties.  This</p>
<p>was begun with alacrity at four different points, officers and men</p>
<p>vieing with one another in the laborious work of destruction.  We had</p>
<p>but few tools, and as the difficulties to overcome were serious, our</p>
<p>progress was slow, until some genius conceived the idea that the</p>
<p>track, rails and ties, might be lifted from its bed bodily, turned</p>
<p>over, and subjected to a high heat; a convenient supply of dry fence-</p>
<p>rails would furnish ample fuel to render the rails useless.  In this</p>
<p>way a good deal of the track was effectively broken up, and</p>
<p>communication by rail from Corinth to the south entirely cut off.</p>
<p>While we were still busy in wrecking the road, a dash was made at my</p>
<p>right and rear by a squadron of Confederate cavalry.  This was</p>
<p>handsomely met by the reserve under Captain Archibald P. Campbell, of</p>
<p>the Second Michigan, who, dismounting a portion of his command,</p>
<p>received the enemy with such a volley from his Colt&#x27;s repeating</p>
<p>rifles that the squadron broke and fled in all directions.  We were</p>
<p>not molested further, and resumed our work, intending to extend the</p>
<p>break toward Baldwin, but receiving orders from Elliott to return to</p>
<p>Booneville immediately, the men were recalled, and we started to</p>
<p>rejoin the main command.</p>
<p>In returning to Booneville, I found the railroad track above where I</p>
<p>had struck it blocked by trains that we had thus cut off, and the</p>
<p>woods and fields around the town covered with several thousand</p>
<p>Confederate soldiers.  These were mostly convalescents and</p>
<p>disheartened stragglers belonging to General Beauregard&#x27;s army, and</p>
<p>from them we learned that Corinth was being evacuated.  I spent some</p>
<p>little time in an endeavor to get these demoralized men into an open</p>
<p>field, with a view to some future disposition of them; but in the</p>
<p>midst of the undertaking I received another order from Colonel</p>
<p>Elliott to join him at once.  The news of the evacuation had also</p>
<p>reached Elliott, and had disclosed a phase of the situation so</p>
<p>different from that under which he had viewed it when we arrived at</p>
<p>Booneville, that he had grown anxious to withdraw, lest we should be</p>
<p>suddenly pounced upon by an overwhelming force from some one of the</p>
<p>columns in retreat.  Under such circumstances my prisoners would</p>
<p>prove a decided embarrassment, so I abandoned further attempts to get</p>
<p>them together--not even paroling them, which I thought might have</p>
<p>been done with but little risk.</p>
<p>In the meantime the captured cars had been fired, and as their</p>
<p>complete destruction was assured by explosions from those containing</p>
<p>ammunition, they needed no further attention, so I withdrew my men</p>
<p>and hastened to join Elliott, taking along some Confederate officers</p>
<p>whom I had retained from among four or five hundred prisoners</p>
<p>captured when making the original dash below the town.</p>
<p>The losses in my regiment, and, in fact, those of the entire command,</p>
<p>were insignificant.  The results of the expedition were important;</p>
<p>the railroad being broken so thoroughly as to cut off all rolling</p>
<p>stock north of Booneville, and to place at the service of General</p>
<p>Halleck&#x27;s army the cars and locomotives of which the retreating</p>
<p>Confederates were now so much in need.  In addition, we burned</p>
<p>twenty-six cars containing ten thousand stand of small arms, three</p>
<p>pieces of artillery, a great quantity of clothing, a heavy supply of</p>
<p>ammunition, and the personal baggage of General Leonidas Polk.  A</p>
<p>large number of prisoners, mostly sick and convalescent, also fell</p>
<p>into our hands; but as we could not carry them with ussuch a hurried</p>
<p>departure was an immediate necessity, by reason of our critical</p>
<p>situation--the process of paroling them was not completed, and they</p>
<p>doubtless passed back to active service in the Confederacy, properly</p>
<p>enough unrecognized as prisoners of war by their superiors.</p>
<p>In returning, the column marched back by another indirect route to</p>
<p>its old camp near Farmington, where we learned that the whole army</p>
<p>had moved into and beyond Corinth, in pursuit of Beauregard, on the</p>
<p>13th of May, the very day we had captured Booneville.  Although we</p>
<p>had marched about one hundred and eighty miles in four days, we were</p>
<p>required to take part, of course, in the pursuit of the Confederate</p>
<p>army.  So, resting but one night in our old camp, we were early in</p>
<p>the saddle again on the morning of the 2d of June.  Marching south</p>
<p>through Corinth, we passed on the 4th of June the scene of our late</p>
<p>raid, viewing with much satisfaction, as we took the road toward</p>
<p>Blackland, the still smoldering embers of the burned trains.</p>
<p>On the 4th of June I was ordered to proceed with my regiment along</p>
<p>the Blackland road to determine the strength of the enemy in that</p>
<p>direction, as it was thought possible we might capture, by a</p>
<p>concerted movement which General John Pope had suggested to General</p>
<p>Halleck, a portion of Beauregard&#x27;s rear guard.  Pushing the</p>
<p>Confederate scouts rapidly in with a running fire for a mile or more,</p>
<p>while we were approaching a little stream, I hoped to gobble the main</p>
<p>body of the enemy&#x27;s pickets.  I therefore directed the sabre</p>
<p>battalion of the regiment, followed by that portion of it armed with</p>
<p>revolving rifles, to dash forward in column, cut off these videttes</p>
<p>before they could cross the stream, and then gather them in.  The</p>
<p>pickets fled hastily, however, and a pell-mell pursuit carried us</p>
<p>over the stream at their heels by a little bridge, with no thought of</p>
<p>halting till we gained a hill on the other side, and suddenly found</p>
<p>ourselves almost in the camp of a strong body of artillery and</p>
<p>infantry.  Captain Campbell being in advance, hurriedly dismounted</p>
<p>his battalion for a further forward movement on foot, but it was</p>
<p>readily seen that the enemy was present in such heavy force as almost</p>
<p>to ensure our destruction, and I gave orders for a hasty withdrawal.</p>
<p>We withdrew without loss under cover of thick woods, aided much,</p>
<p>however, by the consternation of the Confederates, who had hardly</p>
<p>recovered from their surprise at our sudden appearance in their camp</p>
<p>before we had again placed the stream between them and us by</p>
<p>recrossing the bridge.  The reconnoissance was a success in one way--</p>
<p>that is, in finding out that the enemy was at the point supposed by,</p>
<p>General Pope; but it also had a tendency to accelerate Beauregard&#x27;s</p>
<p>retreat, for in a day or two his whole line fell back as far south as</p>
<p>Guntown, thus rendering abortive the plans for bagging a large</p>
<p>portion of his army.</p>
<p>General Beauregard&#x27;s evacuation of Corinth and retreat southward were</p>
<p>accomplished in the face of a largely superior force of Union troops,</p>
<p>and he reached the point where he intended to halt for reorganization</p>
<p>without other loss than that sustained in the destruction of the cars</p>
<p>and supplies at Booneville, and the capture of some stragglers and</p>
<p>deserters that fell into our hands while we were pressing his rear</p>
<p>from General Pope&#x27;s flank.  The number of these was quite large, and</p>
<p>indicated that the enemy was considerably demoralized.  Under such</p>
<p>circumstances, an energetic and skillfully directed pursuit might not</p>
<p>have made certain the enemy&#x27;s destruction, but it would largely have</p>
<p>aided in disintegrating his forces, and I never could quite</p>
<p>understand why it was not ordered.  The desultory affairs between</p>
<p>rear and advance guards seemed as a general, thing to have no</p>
<p>particular purpose in view beyond finding out where the enemy was,</p>
<p>and when he was found, since no supporting colums were at hand and no</p>
<p>one in supreme control was present to give directions, our</p>
<p>skirmishing was of little avail and brought but small reward.</p>
<p>A short time subsequent to these occurrences, Colonel Elliott was</p>
<p>made a brigadier-general, and as General Pope appointed him his</p>
<p>Chief-of-Staff, I, on the 11th of June, 1862, fell in command of the</p>
<p>brigade by seniority.  For the rest of the month but little of moment</p>
<p>occurred, and we settled down into camp at Booneville on the 26th of</p>
<p>June, in a position which my brigade had been ordered to take up some</p>
<p>twenty miles, in advance of the main army for the purpose of covering</p>
<p>its front.  Although but a few days had elapsed from the date of my</p>
<p>appointment as colonel of the Second Michigan to that of my</p>
<p>succeeding to the command of the brigade, I believe I can say with</p>
<p>propriety that I had firmly established myself in the confidence of</p>
<p>the officers and men of the regiment, and won their regard by</p>
<p>thoughtful care.  I had striven unceasingly to have them well fed and</p>
<p>well clothed, had personally looked after the selection of their</p>
<p>camps, and had maintained such a discipline as to allay former</p>
<p>irritation.</p>
<p>Men who march, scout, and fight, and suffer all the hardships that</p>
<p>fall to the lot of soldiers in the field, in order to do vigorous</p>
<p>work must have the best bodily sustenance, and every comfort that can</p>
<p>be provided.  I knew from practical experience on the frontier that</p>
<p>my efforts in this direction would not only be appreciated, but</p>
<p>requited by personal affection and gratitude; and, further, that such</p>
<p>exertions would bring the best results to me.  Whenever my authority</p>
<p>would permit I saved my command from needless sacrifices and</p>
<p>unnecessary toil; therefore, when hard or daring work was to be done</p>
<p>I expected the heartiest response, and always got it.  Soldiers are</p>
<p>averse to seeing their comrades killed without compensating results,</p>
<p>and none realize more quickly than they the blundering that often</p>
<p>takes place on the field of battle.  They want some tangible</p>
<p>indemnity for the loss of life, and as victory is an offset the value</p>
<p>of which is manifest, it not only makes them content to shed their</p>
<p>blood, but also furnishes evidence of capacity in those who command</p>
<p>them.  My regiment had lost very few men since coming under my</p>
<p>command, but it seemed, in the eyes of all who belonged to it, that</p>
<p>casualties to the enemy and some slight successes for us had repaid</p>
<p>every sacrifice, and in consequence I had gained not only their</p>
<p>confidence as soldiers, but also their esteem and love as men, and to</p>
<p>a degree far beyond what I then realized.</p>
<p>As soon as the camp of my brigade was pitched at Booneville, I began</p>
<p>to scout in every direction, to obtain a knowledge of the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>whereabouts and learn the ground about me.  My standing in drawing at</p>
<p>the Military Academy had never been so high as to warrant the belief</p>
<p>that I could ever prove myself an expert, but a few practical lessons</p>
<p>in that line were impressed on me there, and I had retained enough to</p>
<p>enable me to make rough maps that could be readily understood, and</p>
<p>which would be suitable to replace the erroneous skeleton outlines of</p>
<p>northern Mississippi, with which at this time we were scantily</p>
<p>furnished; so as soon as possible I compiled for the use of myself</p>
<p>and my regimental commanders an information map of the surrounding</p>
<p>country.  This map exhibited such details as country roads, streams,</p>
<p>farmhouses, fields, woods, and swamps, and such other topographical</p>
<p>features as would be useful.  I must confess that my crude sketch did</p>
<p>not evidence much artistic merit, but it was an improvement on what</p>
<p>we already possessed in the way of details to guide the command, and</p>
<p>this was what I most needed; for it was of the first importance that</p>
<p>in our exposed condition we should be equipped with a thorough</p>
<p>knowledge of the section in which we were operating, so as to be</p>
<p>prepared to encounter an enemy already indicating recovery from the</p>
<p>disorganizing effects of his recent retreat.</p>
<p>In the immediate vicinity of Booneville the country was covered with</p>
<p>heavy forests, with here and there clearings or intervening fields</p>
<p>that had been devoted to the cultivation of cotton and corn.  The</p>
<p>ground was of a low character, typical of northeastern Mississippi,</p>
<p>and abounded in small creeks that went almost totally dry even in</p>
<p>short periods of drought, but became flooded with muddy water under</p>
<p>the outpouring of rain peculiar to a semi-tropical climate.  In such</p>
<p>a region there were many chances of our being surprised, especially</p>
<p>by an enemy who knew the country well, and whose ranks were filled</p>
<p>with local guides; and great precautions as well as the fullest</p>
<p>information were necessary to prevent disaster.  I therefore</p>
<p>endeavored to familiarize all with our surroundings, but scarcely had</p>
<p>matters begun to shape themselves as I desired when our annihilation</p>
<p>was attempted by a large force of Confederate cavalry.</p>
<p>On the morning of July 1, 1862, a cavalry command of between five and</p>
<p>six thousand-men, under the Confederate General James R. Chalmers,</p>
<p>advanced on two roads converging near Booneville.  The head of the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s column on the Blackland and Booneville road came in contact</p>
<p>with my pickets three miles and a half west of Booneville.  These</p>
<p>pickets, under Lieutenant Leonidas S. Scranton, of the Second</p>
<p>Michigan Cavalry, fell back slowly, taking advantage of every tree or</p>
<p>other cover to fire from till they arrived at the point where the</p>
<p>converging roads joined.  At this junction there was a strong</p>
<p>position in the protecting timber, and here Scranton made a firm</p>
<p>stand, being reinforced presently by the few men he had out as</p>
<p>pickets on the road to his left, a second company I had sent him from</p>
<p>camp, and subsequently by three companies more, all now commanded by</p>
<p>Captain Campbell.  This force was dismounted and formed in line, and</p>
<p>soon developed that the enemy was present in large numbers.  Up to</p>
<p>this time Chalmers had shown only the heads of his columns, and we</p>
<p>had doubts as to his purpose, but now that our resistance forced him</p>
<p>to deploy two regiments on the right and left of the road, it became</p>
<p>apparent that he meant business, and that there was no time to lose</p>
<p>in preparing to repel his attack.</p>
<p>Full information of the situation was immediately sent me, and I</p>
<p>directed Campbell to hold fast, if possible, till I could support</p>
<p>him, but if compelled to retire he was authorized to do so slowly,</p>
<p>taking advantage of every means that fell in his way to prolong the</p>
<p>fighting.  Before this I had stationed one battalion of the Second</p>
<p>Iowa in Booneville, but Colonel Edward Hatch, commanding that</p>
<p>regiment, was now directed to leave one company for the protection of</p>
<p>our camp a little to the north of the station, and take the balance</p>
<p>of the Second Iowa, with the battalion in Booneville except two sabre</p>
<p>companies, and form the whole in rear of Captain Campbell, to protect</p>
<p>his flanks and support him by a charge should the enemy break his</p>
<p>dismounted line.</p>
<p>While these preparations were being made, the Confederates attempted</p>
<p>to drive Campbell from his position by a direct attack through an</p>
<p>open field.  In this they failed, however, for our men, reserving</p>
<p>their fire until the enemy came within about thirty yards, then</p>
<p>opened on him with such a shower of bullets from our Colt&#x27;s rifles</p>
<p>that it soon became too hot for him, and he was repulsed with</p>
<p>considerable loss.  Foiled in this move, Chalmers hesitated to attack</p>
<p>again in front, but began overlapping both flanks of Campbell&#x27;s line</p>
<p>by force of numbers, compelling Campbell to retire toward a strong</p>
<p>position I had selected in his rear for a line on which to make our</p>
<p>main resistance.  As soon as the enemy saw this withdrawing he again</p>
<p>charged in front, but was again as gallantly repelled as in the first</p>
<p>assault, although the encounter was for a short time so desperate as</p>
<p>to have the character of a hand-to-hand conflict, several groups of</p>
<p>friend and foe using on each other the butts of their guns.  At this</p>
<p>juncture the timely arrival of Colonel Hatch with the Second Iowa</p>
<p>gave a breathing-spell to Campbell, and made the Confederates so</p>
<p>chary of further direct attacks that he was enabled to retire; and at</p>
<p>the same time I found opportunity to make disposition of the</p>
<p>reinforcement to the best advantage possible, placing the Second Iowa</p>
<p>on the left of the new line and strengthening Campbell on its right</p>
<p>with all the men available.</p>
<p>In view of his numbers, the enemy soon regained confidence in his</p>
<p>ability to overcome us, and in a little while again began his</p>
<p>flanking movements, his right passing around my left flank some</p>
<p>distance, and approaching our camp and transportation, which I had</p>
<p>forbidden to be moved out to the rear.  Fearing that he would envelop</p>
<p>us and capture the camp and transportation, I determined to take the</p>
<p>offensive.  Remembering a circuitous wood road that I had become</p>
<p>familiar with while making the map heretofore mentioned, I concluded</p>
<p>that the most effective plan would be to pass a small column around</p>
<p>the enemy&#x27;s left, by way of this road, and strike his rear by a</p>
<p>mounted charge simultaneously with an advance of our main line on his</p>
<p>front.  I knew that the attack in rear would be a most hazardous</p>
<p>undertaking, but in the face of such odds as the enemy had the</p>
<p>condition of affairs was most critical, and could be relieved, only</p>
<p>by a bold and radical change in our tactics; so I at once selected</p>
<p>four sabre companies, two from the Second Michigan and two from the</p>
<p>Second Iowa, and placing Captain Alger, of the former regiment, in</p>
<p>command of them, I informed him that I expected of them the quick and</p>
<p>desperate work that is usually imposed on a forlorn hope.</p>
<p>To carry out the purpose now in view, I instructed Captain Alger to</p>
<p>follow the wood road as it led around the left of the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>advancing forces, to a point where &#x27;it joined the Blackland road,</p>
<p>about three miles from Booneville, and directed him, upon reaching</p>
<p>the Blackland road, to turn up it immediately, and charge the rear of</p>
<p>the enemy&#x27;s line.  Under no circumstances was he to deploy the</p>
<p>battalion, but charge in column right through whatever he came upon,</p>
<p>and report to me in front of Booneville, if at all possible for him</p>
<p>to get there.  If he failed to break through the enemy&#x27;s line, he was</p>
<p>to go ahead as far as he could, and then if any of his men were left,</p>
<p>and he was able to retreat, he was to do so by the same route he had</p>
<p>taken on his way out.  To conduct him on this perilous service I sent</p>
<p>along a thin, sallow, tawny-haired Mississippian named Beene, whom I</p>
<p>had employed as a guide and scout a few days before, on account of</p>
<p>his intimate knowledge of the roads, from the public thoroughfares</p>
<p>down to the insignificant by-paths of the neighboring swamps.  With</p>
<p>such guidance I felt sure that the column would get to the desired</p>
<p>point without delay, for there was no danger of its being lost or</p>
<p>misled by taking any of the many by-roads which traversed the dense</p>
<p>forests through which it would be obliged to pass.  I also informed</p>
<p>Alger that I should take the reserve and join the main line in front</p>
<p>of Booneville for the purpose of making an advance of my whole force,</p>
<p>and that as a signal he must have his men cheer loudly when he struck</p>
<p>the enemy&#x27;s rear, in order that my attack might be simultaneous with</p>
<p>his.</p>
<p>I gave him one hour to go around and come back through the enemy, and</p>
<p>when he started I moved to the front with the balance of the reserve,</p>
<p>to put everything I had into the fight.  This meant an inestimable</p>
<p>advantage to the enemy in case of our defeat, but our own safety</p>
<p>demanded the hazard.  All along our attenuated line the fighting was</p>
<p>now sharp, and the enemy&#x27;s firing indicated such numerical strength</p>
<p>that fear of disaster to Alger increased my anxiety terribly as the</p>
<p>time set for his cheering arrived and no sound of it was heard.</p>
<p>Relying, however, on the fact that Beene&#x27;s knowledge of the roads</p>
<p>would prevent his being led astray, and confident of Alger&#x27;s</p>
<p>determination to accomplish the purpose for which he set out, as soon</p>
<p>as the hour was up I ordered my whole line forward.  Fortunately,</p>
<p>just as this moment a locomotive and two cars loaded with grain for</p>
<p>my horses ran into Booneville from Corinth.  I say fortunately,</p>
<p>because it was well known throughout the command that in the morning,</p>
<p>when I first discovered the large numbers of the enemy, I had called</p>
<p>for assistance; and my troops, now thinking that reinforcements had</p>
<p>arrived by rail from Rienzi, where a division of infantry was</p>
<p>encamped, and inspirated by this belief, advanced with renewed</p>
<p>confidence and wild cheering.  Meantime I had the engineer of the</p>
<p>locomotive blow his whistle loudly, so that the enemy might also</p>
<p>learn that a train had come; and from the fact that in a few moments</p>
<p>he began to give way before our small force, I thought that this</p>
<p>strategem had some effect.  Soon his men broke, and ran in the utmost</p>
<p>disorder over the country in every direction.  I found later,</p>
<p>however, that his precipitous retreat was due to the pressure on his</p>
<p>left from the Second Iowa, in concert with the front attack of the</p>
<p>Second Michigan, and the demoralization wrought in his rear by Alger,</p>
<p>who had almost entirely accomplished the purpose of his expedition,</p>
<p>though he had failed to come through, or so near that I could hear</p>
<p>the signal agreed upon before leaving Booneville.</p>
<p>After Alger had reached and turned up the Blackland road, the first</p>
<p>thing he came across was the Confederate headquarters; the officers</p>
<p>and orderlies about which he captured and sent back some distance to</p>
<p>a farm-house.  Continuing on a gallop, he soon struck the rear of the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s line, but was unable to get through; nor did he get near</p>
<p>enough for me to hear his cheering; but as he had made the distance</p>
<p>he was to travel in the time allotted, his attack and mine were</p>
<p>almost coincident, and the enemy, stampeded by the charges in front</p>
<p>and rear, fled toward Blackland, with little or no attempt to capture</p>
<p>Alger&#x27;s command, which might readily have been done.  Alger&#x27;s</p>
<p>troopers soon rejoined me at Booneville, minus many hats, having</p>
<p>returned by their original route.  They had sustained little loss</p>
<p>except a few men wounded and a few temporarily missing.  Among these</p>
<p>was Alger himself, who was dragged from his saddle by the limb of a</p>
<p>tree that, in the excitement of the charge, he was unable to flank.</p>
<p>The missing had been dismounted in one way or another, and run over</p>
<p>by the enemy in his flight; but they all turned up later, none the</p>
<p>worse except for a few scratches and bruises.</p>
<p>My effective strength in this fight was 827 all told, and Alger&#x27;s</p>
<p>command comprised ninety officers and men.  Chalmers&#x27;s force was</p>
<p>composed of six regiments and two battalions, and though I have been</p>
<p>unable to find any returns from which to verify his actual numbers,</p>
<p>yet, from the statements of prisoners and from information obtained</p>
<p>from citizens along his line of march, it is safe to say that he had</p>
<p>in the action not less than five-thousand men.  Our casualties were</p>
<p>not many--forty-one in all.  His loss in killed and wounded was</p>
<p>considerable, his most severely wounded--forty men--falling into our</p>
<p>hands, having been left at farm-houses in the vicinity of the</p>
<p>battlefield.</p>
<p>The victory in the face of such odds was most gratifying, and as it</p>
<p>justified my disinclination--in fact, refusal--to retire from</p>
<p>Booneville without fighting (for the purpose of saving my</p>
<p>transportation, as directed by superior authority when I applied in</p>
<p>the morning for reinforcements), it was to me particularly grateful.</p>
<p>It was also very valuable in, view of the fact that it increased the</p>
<p>confidence between the officers and men of my brigade and me, and</p>
<p>gave us for the balance of the month not only comparative rest, but</p>
<p>entire immunity from the dangers of a renewed effort to gobble my</p>
<p>isolated outpost.  In addition to all this, commendation from my</p>
<p>immediate superiors was promptly tendered through oral and written</p>
<p>congratulations; and their satisfaction at the result of the battle</p>
<p>took definite form a few days later, in the following application for</p>
<p>my promotion, when, by an expedition to Ripley, Miss., most valuable</p>
<p>information as to the enemy&#x27;s location and plans was captured:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,</p>
<p>&quot;JULY 30, 1862.--3.05 P. M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK,</p>
<p>&quot;Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>&quot;Brigadiers scarce; good ones scarce.  Asboth goes on the month&#x27;s</p>
<p>leave you gave him ten months since; Granger has temporary command.</p>
<p>The undersigned respectfully beg that you will obtain the promotion</p>
<p>of Sheridan.  He is worth his weight in gold.  His Ripley expedition</p>
<p>has brought us captured letters of immense value, as well as</p>
<p>prisoners, showing the rebel plans and dispositions, as you will</p>
<p>learn from District Commander.</p>
<p>&quot;W. S. ROSECRANS, Brigadier-General.</p>
<p>&quot;C. C. SULLIVAN,      &quot;       &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;G. GRANGER,          &quot;       &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W. L. ELLIOTT,       &quot;       &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A. ASBOTH,           &quot;       &quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<p>IN CAMP NEAR RIENZI--GENERAL GRANGER--A VALUABLE CAPTURE AT RIPLEY--</p>
<p>RAIDING A CORNFIELD--REPULSING AN ATTACK--PRESENTED WITH THE BLACK</p>
<p>HORSE &quot;RIENZI&quot;--MEETING GENERAL GRANT--APPOINTED A BRIGADIER-GENERAL.</p>
<p>After the battle of Booneville, it was decided by General Rosecrans,</p>
<p>on the advice of General Granger, that my position at Booneville was</p>
<p>too much exposed, despite the fact that late on the evening of the</p>
<p>fight my force had been increased by the addition of, a battery of</p>
<p>four guns and two companies of infantry, and by the Third Michigan</p>
<p>Cavalry, commanded by Colonel John K. Mizner; so I was directed to</p>
<p>withdraw from my post and go into camp near Rienzi, Mississippi,</p>
<p>where I could equally well cover the roads in front of the army, and</p>
<p>also be near General Asboth&#x27;s division of infantry, which occupied a</p>
<p>line in rear of the town.  This section of country, being higher and</p>
<p>more rolling than that in the neighborhood of Booneville, had many</p>
<p>advantages in the way of better camping-grounds, better grazing and</p>
<p>the like, but I moved with reluctance, because I feared that my</p>
<p>proximity to Asboth would diminish to a certain extent my</p>
<p>independence of command.</p>
<p>General Asboth was a tall, spare, handsome man, with gray mustache</p>
<p>and a fierce look.  He was an educated soldier, of unquestioned</p>
<p>courage, but the responsibilities of outpost duty bore rather heavily</p>
<p>on him, and he kept all hands in a state of constant worry in</p>
<p>anticipation of imaginary attacks.  His ideas of discipline were not</p>
<p>very rigid either, and as by this time there had been introduced into</p>
<p>my brigade some better methods than those obtaining when it first</p>
<p>fell to my command, I feared the effect should he, have any control</p>
<p>over it, or meddle with its internal affairs.  However, there was</p>
<p>nothing to do but to move to the place designated, but General</p>
<p>Granger, who still commanded the cavalry division to which the</p>
<p>brigade belonged, so arranged matters with General Rosecrans, who had</p>
<p>succeeded to the command of the Army of the Mississippi, that my</p>
<p>independence was to be undisturbed, except in case of a general</p>
<p>attack by the enemy.</p>
<p>We went into camp near Rienzi, July 22, sending back to the general</p>
<p>field-hospital at Tuscumbia Springs all our sick--a considerable</p>
<p>number--stricken down by the malarial influences around Booneville.</p>
<p>In a few days the fine grazing arid abundance of grain for our</p>
<p>exhausted horses brought about their recuperation; and the many large</p>
<p>open fields in the vicinity gave opportunity for drills and parades,</p>
<p>which were much needed.  I turned my attention to those disciplinary</p>
<p>measures which, on account of active work in the field, had been</p>
<p>necessarily neglected since the brigade had arrived at Pittsburg</p>
<p>Landing, in April; and besides, we had been busy in collecting</p>
<p>information by scouting parties and otherwise, in prosecution of the</p>
<p>purpose for which we were covering the main army.</p>
<p>I kept up an almost daily correspondence with General Granger,</p>
<p>concerning the, information obtained by scouts and reconnoitring</p>
<p>parties, and he came often to Rienzi to see me in relation to this</p>
<p>and other matters.  Previously I had not had much personal</p>
<p>association with Granger.  While I was at Halleck&#x27;s headquarters we</p>
<p>met on one or two occasions, and the day I joined the Second Michigan</p>
<p>at Farmington I saw him for a few moments, but, with such slight</p>
<p>exception, our intercourse had been almost exclusively official.  He</p>
<p>had suggested my name, I was told, to Governor Blair, when the</p>
<p>Governor was in search of an officer of the regular army to appoint</p>
<p>to the colonelcy of the Second Michigan Cavalry, but his</p>
<p>recommendation must have been mainly based on the favorable opinions</p>
<p>he had heard expressed by General Halleck and by some of the officers</p>
<p>of his staff, rather than from any personal knowledge of my capacity.</p>
<p>Of course I was very grateful for this, but some of his</p>
<p>characteristics did not impress me favorably, and I sometimes wished</p>
<p>the distance between our camps greater.  His most serious failing was</p>
<p>an uncontrollable propensity to interfere with and direct the minor</p>
<p>matters relating to the command, the details for which those under</p>
<p>him were alone responsible.  Ill-judged meddling in this respect</p>
<p>often led to differences between us, only temporary it is true, but</p>
<p>most harassing to the subordinate, since I was compelled by the</p>
<p>circumstances of the situation not only invariably to yield my own</p>
<p>judgment, but many a time had to play peacemaker--smoothing down</p>
<p>ruffled feelings, that I knew had been excited by Granger&#x27;s freaky</p>
<p>and spasmodic efforts to correct personally some trifling fault that</p>
<p>ought to have been left to a regimental or company commander to</p>
<p>remedy.  Yet with all these small blemishes Granger had many good</p>
<p>qualities, and his big heart was so full of generous impulses and</p>
<p>good motives as to far outbalance his short-comings; and not-</p>
<p>withstanding the friction and occasional acerbity of our official</p>
<p>intercourse, we maintained friendly relations till his death.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the fatal mistake made by dispersing Halleck&#x27;s forces</p>
<p>after the fall of Corinth, General Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s Army of the</p>
<p>Ohio had been started some time before on its march eastward toward</p>
<p>Chattanooga; and as this movement would be followed of course by a</p>
<p>manoeuvre on the part of the enemy, now at Tupelo under General</p>
<p>Braxton Bragg, either to meet Buell or frustrate his designs by some</p>
<p>counter-operation, I was expected to furnish, by scouting and all</p>
<p>other means available, information as to what was going on within the</p>
<p>Confederate lines.  To do the work required, necessitated an increase</p>
<p>of my command, and the Seventh Kansas Cavalry was therefore added to</p>
<p>it, and my picket-line extended so as to cover from Jacinto</p>
<p>southwesterly to a point midway between Rienzi and Booneville, and</p>
<p>then northwesterly to the Hatchie River.  Skirmishes between outposts</p>
<p>on this line were of frequent occurrence, with small results to</p>
<p>either side, but they were somewhat annoying, particularly in the</p>
<p>direction of Ripley, where the enemy maintained a considerable</p>
<p>outpost.  Deciding to cripple if not capture this outpost, on the</p>
<p>evening of July 27, I sent out an expedition under Colonel Hatch,</p>
<p>which drove the enemy from the town of Ripley and took a few</p>
<p>prisoners, but the most valuable prize was in the shape of a package</p>
<p>of thirty-two private letters, the partial reading of which disclosed</p>
<p>to me the positive transfer from Mississippi of most of Bragg&#x27;s army,</p>
<p>for the purpose of counteracting Buell&#x27;s operations in northern</p>
<p>Alabama and East Tennessee.  This decisive evidence was of the utmost</p>
<p>importance, and without taking time to read all the letters, I</p>
<p>forwarded them to General Granger July 28, in a despatch which</p>
<p>stated: &quot;I deem it necessary to send them at once; the enemy is</p>
<p>moving in large force on Chattanooga.&quot;  Other than this the results</p>
<p>of the expedition were few; and the enemy, having fled from Ripley</p>
<p>with but slight resistance, accompanied by almost all the</p>
<p>inhabitants, re-occupied the place next day after our people had</p>
<p>quitted it, and resumed in due time his annoying attacks on our</p>
<p>outposts, both sides trying to achieve something whenever occasion</p>
<p>offered.</p>
<p>The prevalence of a severe drought had resulted in drying up many of</p>
<p>the streams within the enemy&#x27;s lines, and, in consequence, he was</p>
<p>obliged to shift his camps often, and send his beef-cattle and mules</p>
<p>near his outposts for water.  My scouts kept me well posted in regard</p>
<p>to the movements of both camps and herds; and a favorable opportunity</p>
<p>presenting itself, I sent an expedition on August 14 to gather in</p>
<p>some animals located on Twenty-Mile Creek, a stream always supplied</p>
<p>with water from a source of never-failing, springs.  Our side met</p>
<p>with complete success in this instance, and when the expedition</p>
<p>returned, we were all made happy by an abundance of fresh beef, and</p>
<p>by some two hundred captured mules, that we thus added to our trains</p>
<p>at a time when draft animals were much needed.</p>
<p>Rations for the men were now supplied in fair quantities, and the</p>
<p>only thing required to make us wholly contented was plenty of grain</p>
<p>for our animals.  Because of the large number of troops then in West</p>
<p>Tennessee and about Corinth, the indifferent railroad leading down</p>
<p>from Columbus, Ky., was taxed to its utmost capacity to transport</p>
<p>supplies.  The quantity of grain received at Corinth from the north</p>
<p>was therefore limited, and before reaching the different outposts, by</p>
<p>passing through intermediate depots of supply, it had dwindled to</p>
<p>insignificance.  I had hopes, however, that this condition of things</p>
<p>might be ameliorated before long by gathering a good supply of corn</p>
<p>that was ripening in the neighborhood, and would soon, I thought, be</p>
<p>sufficiently hard to feed to my animals.  Not far from my</p>
<p>headquarters there was a particularly fine field, which, with this</p>
<p>end in view, I had carefully protected through the milky stage, to</p>
<p>the evident disappointment of both Asboth&#x27;s men and mine.  They bore</p>
<p>the prohibition well while it affected only themselves, but the trial</p>
<p>was too great when it came to denying their horses; and men whose</p>
<p>discipline kept faith with my guards during the roasting-ear period</p>
<p>now fell from grace.  Their horses were growing thin, and few could</p>
<p>withstand the mute appeals of their suffering pets; so at night the</p>
<p>corn, because of individual foraging, kept stealthily and steadily</p>
<p>vanishing, until the field was soon fringed with only earless stalks.</p>
<p>The disappearance was noticed, and the guard increased, but still the</p>
<p>quantity of corn continued to grow less, the more honest troopers</p>
<p>bemoaning the loss, and questioning the honor of those to whose</p>
<p>safekeeping it had been entrusted.  Finally, doubtless under the</p>
<p>apprehension that through their irregularities the corn would all</p>
<p>disappear and find its way to the horses in accordance with the</p>
<p>stealthy enterprise of their owners, a general raid was made on the</p>
<p>field in broad daylight, and though the guard drove off the</p>
<p>marauders, I must admit that its efforts to keep them back were so</p>
<p>unsuccessful that my hopes for an equal distribution of the crop were</p>
<p>quickly blasted.  One look at the field told that it had been swept</p>
<p>clean of its grain.  Of course a great row occurred as to who was to</p>
<p>blame, and many arrests and trials took place, but there had been</p>
<p>such an interchanging of cap numbers and other insignia that it was</p>
<p>next to impossible to identify the guilty, and so much crimination</p>
<p>and acrimony grew out of the affair that it was deemed best to drop</p>
<p>the whole matter.</p>
<p>On August 27 about half of the command was absent reconnoitring, I</p>
<p>having sent it south toward Tupelo, in the hope of obtaining some</p>
<p>definite information regarding a movement to Holly Springs of the</p>
<p>remainder of the Confederate army, under General Price, when about</p>
<p>mid-day I was suddenly aroused by excited cries and sounds of firing,</p>
<p>and I saw in a moment that the enemy was in my camp.  He had come in</p>
<p>on my right flank from the direction of the Hatchie River, pell-mell</p>
<p>with our picket-post stationed about three miles out on the Ripley</p>
<p>road.  The whole force of the enemy comprised about eight hundred,</p>
<p>but only his advance entered with my pickets, whom he had charged and</p>
<p>badly stampeded, without, on their part, the pretense of a fight in</p>
<p>behalf of those whom it was their duty to protect until proper</p>
<p>dispositions for defense could be made.  The day was excessively hot,</p>
<p>one of those sultry debilitating days that had caused the suspending</p>
<p>of all military exercises; and as most of the men were lounging or</p>
<p>sleeping in their tents, we were literally caught napping.  The alarm</p>
<p>spread instantly through the camp, and in a moment the command turned</p>
<p>out for action, somewhat in deshabille it is true, but none the less</p>
<p>effective, for every man had grabbed his rifle and cartridge-box at</p>
<p>the first alarm.  Aided by a few shots from Captain Henry Hescock&#x27;s</p>
<p>battery, we soon drove the intruders from our camp in about the same</p>
<p>disorder in which they had broken in on us.  By this time Colonel</p>
<p>Hatch and Colonel Albert L. Lee had mounted two battalions each, and</p>
<p>I moved them out at a lively pace in pursuit, followed by a section</p>
<p>of the battery.  No halt was called till we came upon the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>main body, under Colonel Faulkner, drawn up in line of battle near</p>
<p>Newland&#x27;s store.  Opening on him with the two pieces of artillery, I</p>
<p>hurriedly formed line confronting him, and quickly and with but</p>
<p>little resistance drove him in confusion from the field.  The sudden</p>
<p>turning of the tables dismayed Faulkner&#x27;s men, and panic seizing</p>
<p>them, they threw away every loose article of arms or clothing of</p>
<p>which they could dismember themselves, and ran in the wildest</p>
<p>disorder in a mad effort to escape.  As the chase went on the panic</p>
<p>increased, the clouds of dust from the road causing an intermingling</p>
<p>of friend and foe.  In a little while the affair grew most ludicrous,</p>
<p>Faulkner&#x27;s hatless and coatless men taking to the woods in such</p>
<p>dispersed order and so demoralized that a good many prisoners were</p>
<p>secured, and those of the enemy who escaped were hunted until dark.</p>
<p>When the recall was sounded, our men came in loaded down with plunder</p>
<p>in the shape of hats, haversacks, blankets, pistols, and shotguns, in</p>
<p>a quantity which amply repaid for the surprise of the morning, but</p>
<p>did not excuse the delinquent commander of our picket-guard, who a</p>
<p>few days later was brought to a realizing sense of his duty by a</p>
<p>court-martial.</p>
<p>Shortly after this affair Captain Archibald P. Campbell, of the</p>
<p>Second Michigan Cavalry, presented me with the black horse called</p>
<p>Rienzi, since made historical from having been ridden by me in many</p>
<p>battles, conspicuously in the ride from Winchester to Cedar Creek,</p>
<p>which has been celebrated in the poem by T. Buchanan Read.  This</p>
<p>horse was of Morgan stock, and then about three years old.  He was</p>
<p>jet black, excepting three white feet, sixteen hands high, and</p>
<p>strongly built, with great powers of endurance.  He was so active</p>
<p>that he could cover with ease five miles an hour at his natural</p>
<p>walking gait.  The gelding had been ridden very seldom; in fact,</p>
<p>Campbell had been unaccustomed to riding till the war broke out, and,</p>
<p>I think, felt some disinclination to mount the fiery colt.  Campbell</p>
<p>had an affection for him, however, that never waned, and would often</p>
<p>come to my headquarters to see his favorite, the colt being cared for</p>
<p>there by the regimental farrier, an old man named John Ashley, who</p>
<p>had taken him in charge when leaving Michigan, and had been his groom</p>
<p>ever since.  Seeing that I liked the horse--I had ridden him on</p>
<p>several occasions--Campbell presented him to me on one of these</p>
<p>visits, and from that time till the close of the war I rode him</p>
<p>almost continuously, in every campaign and battle in which I took</p>
<p>part, without once finding him overcome by fatigue, though on many</p>
<p>occasions his strength was severely tested by long marches and short</p>
<p>rations.  I never observed in him any vicious habit; a nervousness</p>
<p>and restlessness and switch of the tail, when everything about him</p>
<p>was in repose, being the only indication that he might be</p>
<p>untrustworthy.  No one but a novice could be deceived by this,</p>
<p>however, for the intelligence evinced in every feature, and his</p>
<p>thoroughbred appearance, were so striking that any person accustomed</p>
<p>to horses could not misunderstand such a noble animal.  But Campbell</p>
<p>thought otherwise, at least when the horse was to a certain degree</p>
<p>yet untrained, and could not be pursuaded to ride him; indeed, for</p>
<p>more than a year after he was given to me, Campbell still retained</p>
<p>suspicions of his viciousness, though, along with this mistrust, an</p>
<p>undiminished affection.  Although he was several times wounded, this</p>
<p>horse escaped death in action; and living to a ripe old age, died in</p>
<p>1878, attended to the last with all the care and surrounded with</p>
<p>every comfort due the faithful service he had rendered.</p>
<p>In moving from Corinth east toward Chattanooga, General Buell&#x27;s army</p>
<p>was much delayed by the requirement that he should repair the Memphis</p>
<p>and Charleston railroad as he progressed.  The work of repair obliged</p>
<p>him to march very slowly, and was of but little use when done, for</p>
<p>guerrillas and other bands of Confederates destroyed the road again</p>
<p>as soon as he had passed on.  But worst of all, the time thus</p>
<p>consumed gave General Bragg the opportunity to reorganize and</p>
<p>increase his army to such an extent that he was able to contest the</p>
<p>possession of Middle Tennessee and Kentucky.  Consequently, the</p>
<p>movement of this army through Tennessee and Kentucky toward the Ohio</p>
<p>River--its objective points being Louisville and Cincinnati--was now</p>
<p>well defined, and had already rendered abortive General Buell&#x27;s</p>
<p>designs on Chattanooga and East Tennessee.  Therefore extraordinary</p>
<p>efforts on the part of the Government became necessary, and the</p>
<p>concentration of National troops at Louisville and Cincinnati to meet</p>
<p>the contingency of Bragg&#x27;s reaching those points was an obvious</p>
<p>requirement.  These troops were drawn from all sections in the West</p>
<p>where it was thought they could be spared, and among others I was</p>
<p>ordered to conduct thither--to Louisville or Cincinnati, as</p>
<p>subsequent developments might demand--my regiment, Hescock&#x27;s battery,</p>
<p>the Second and Fifteenth Missouri, and the Thirty-sixth and Forty-</p>
<p>fourth Illinois regiments of infantry, known as the &quot;Pea Ridge</p>
<p>Brigade.&quot; With this column I marched back to Corinth on the 6th of</p>
<p>September, 1862, for the purpose of getting railroad transportation</p>
<p>to Columbus, Kentucky.</p>
<p>At Corinth I met General Grant, who by this time had been</p>
<p>reestablished in favor and command somewhat, General Halleck having</p>
<p>departed for Washington to assume command of the army as General-in-</p>
<p>Chief.  Before and during the activity which followed his</p>
<p>reinstatement, General Grant had become familiar with my services</p>
<p>through the transmission to Washington of information I had furnished</p>
<p>concerning the enemy&#x27;s movements, and by reading reports of my fights</p>
<p>and skirmishes in front, and he was loth to let me go.  Indeed, he</p>
<p>expressed surprise at seeing me in Corinth, and said he had not</p>
<p>expected me to go; he also plainly showed that he was much hurt at</p>
<p>the inconsiderate way in which his command was being depleted.  Since</p>
<p>I was of the opinion that the chief field of usefulness and</p>
<p>opportunity was opening up in Kentucky, I did not wish him to retain</p>
<p>me, which he might have done, and I impressed him with my conviction,</p>
<p>somewhat emphatically, I fear.  Our conversation ended with my wish</p>
<p>gratified.  I afterward learned that General Granger, whom General</p>
<p>Grant did not fancy, had suggested that I should take to Cincinnati</p>
<p>the main portion of Granger&#x27;s command--the Pea Ridge Brigade--as well</p>
<p>as the Second Michigan Cavalry, of which I was still colonel.</p>
<p>We started that night, going by rail over the Mobile and Ohio road to</p>
<p>Columbus, Ky., where we embarked on steamboats awaiting us.  These</p>
<p>boats were five in number, and making one of them my flag-ship,</p>
<p>expecting that we might come upon certain batteries reported to be</p>
<p>located upon the Kentucky shore of the Ohio, I directed the rest to</p>
<p>follow my lead.  Just before reaching Caseyville, the captain of a</p>
<p>tin-clad gunboat that was patrolling the river brought me the</p>
<p>information that the enemy was in strong force at Caseyville, and</p>
<p>expressed a fear that my fleet could not pass his batteries.</p>
<p>Accepting the information as correct, I concluded to capture the</p>
<p>place before trying to pass up the river.  Pushing in to the bank as</p>
<p>we neared the town, I got the troops ashore and moved on Caseyville,</p>
<p>in the expectation of a bloody fight, but was agreeably surprised</p>
<p>upon reaching the outskirts of the village by an outpouring of its</p>
<p>inhabitants--men, women, and children--carrying the Stars and</p>
<p>Stripes, and making the most loyal professions.  Similar</p>
<p>demonstrations of loyalty had been made to the panic-stricken captain</p>
<p>of the gunboat when he passed down the river, but he did not stay to</p>
<p>ascertain their character, neither by landing nor by inquiry, for he</p>
<p>assumed that on the Kentucky bank of the river there could be no</p>
<p>loyalty.  The result mortified the captain intensely; and deeming his</p>
<p>convoy of little further use, he steamed toward Cairo in quest of</p>
<p>other imaginary batteries, while I re-embarked at Caseyville, and</p>
<p>continued up the Ohio undisturbed.  About three miles below</p>
<p>Cincinnati I received instructions to halt, and next day I was</p>
<p>ordered by Major-General H. G. Wright to take my troops back to</p>
<p>Louisville, and there assume command of the Pea Ridge Brigade,</p>
<p>composed of the Second and Fifteenth Missouri, Thirty-sixth and</p>
<p>Forty-fourth Illinois infantry, and of such other regiments as might</p>
<p>be sent me in advance of the arrival of General Buell&#x27;s army.</p>
<p>When I reached Louisville I reported to Major-General William Nelson,</p>
<p>who was sick, and who received me as he lay in bed.  He asked me why</p>
<p>I did not wear the shoulder-straps of my rank.  I answered that I was</p>
<p>the colonel of the Second Michigan cavalry, and had on my appropriate</p>
<p>shoulder-straps.  He replied that I was a brigadier-general for the</p>
<p>Booneville fight, July 1, and that I should wear the shoulder-straps</p>
<p>of that grade.  I returned to my command and put it in camp; and as I</p>
<p>had no reluctance to wearing the shoulder-straps of a brigadier-</p>
<p>general, I was not long in procuring a pair, particularly as I was</p>
<p>fortified next day by receiving from Washington official information</p>
<p>of my appointment as a brigadier-general, to date from July 1, 1862,</p>
<p>the day of the battle of Booneville</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
<p>GOOD ADVICE FROM GENERAL NELSON--HIS TRAGIC DEATH--PUTTING LOUISVILLE</p>
<p>IN A STATE OF DEFENSE--ASSIGNED TO THE COMMAND OF THE ELEVENTH</p>
<p>DIVISION--CAPTURE OF CHAPLIN HEIGHTS--BATTLE OF PERRYVILLE--REPORTED</p>
<p>AMONG THE KILLED--A THRILLING INCIDENT--GENERAL BUELL RELIEVED BY</p>
<p>GENERAL ROSECRANS.</p>
<p>I reported to Major-General Nelson at the Galt House in Louisville,</p>
<p>September 14, 1862, who greeted me in the bluff and hearty fashion of</p>
<p>a sailor--for he had been in the navy till the breaking out of the</p>
<p>war.  The new responsibilities that were now to fall upon me by</p>
<p>virtue of increased rank caused in my mind an uneasiness which, I</p>
<p>think, Nelson observed at the interview, and he allayed it by giving</p>
<p>me much good advice, and most valuable information in regard to</p>
<p>affairs in Kentucky, telling me also that he intended I should retain</p>
<p>in my command the Pea Ridge Brigade and Hescock&#x27;s battery.  This</p>
<p>latter assurance relieved me greatly, for I feared the loss of these</p>
<p>troops in the general redistribution which I knew must soon take</p>
<p>place; and being familiar with their valuable service in Missouri,</p>
<p>and having brought them up from Mississippi, I hoped they would</p>
<p>continue with me.  He directed me to take position just below the</p>
<p>city with the Pea Ridge Brigade, Hescock&#x27;s battery, and the Second</p>
<p>Michigan Cavalry, informing me, at the same time, that some of the</p>
<p>new regiments, then arriving under a recent call of the President for</p>
<p>volunteers, would also be assigned to my command.  Shortly after the</p>
<p>interview eight new regiments and an additional battery joined me,</p>
<p>thus making good his promise of more troops.</p>
<p>A few days later came Nelson&#x27;s tragic end, shocking the whole</p>
<p>country.  Those of us in camp outside of the city were startled on</p>
<p>the morning of September 29 by the news that General Jefferson C.</p>
<p>Davis, of the Union Army, had shot General Nelson at the Galt House,</p>
<p>and the wildest rumors in regard to the occurrence came thick and</p>
<p>fast; one to the effect that Nelson was dead, another having it that</p>
<p>he was living and had killed Davis, and still others reflecting on</p>
<p>the loyalty of both, it being supposed by the general public at first</p>
<p>that the difficulty between the two men had grown out of some</p>
<p>political rather than official or personal differences.  When the</p>
<p>news came, I rode into the city to the Galt House to learn the</p>
<p>particulars, reaching there about 10 o&#x27;clock in the forenoon.  Here I</p>
<p>learned that Nelson had been shot by Davis about two hours before, at</p>
<p>the foot of the main stairway leading from the corridor just beyond</p>
<p>the office to the second floor, and that Nelson was already dead.  It</p>
<p>was almost as difficult to get reliable particulars of the matter at</p>
<p>the hotel as it had been in my camp, but I gathered that the two men</p>
<p>had met first at an early hour near the counter of the hotel office,</p>
<p>and that an altercation which had begun several days before in</p>
<p>relation to something official was renewed by Davis, who, attempting</p>
<p>to speak to Nelson in regard to the subject-matter of their previous</p>
<p>dispute, was met by an insulting refusal to listen.  It now appears</p>
<p>that when Nelson made this offensive remark, Davis threw a small</p>
<p>paper ball that he was nervously rolling between his fingers into</p>
<p>Nelson&#x27;s face, and that this insult was returned by Nelson slapping</p>
<p>Davis (Killed by a Brother Soldier.--Gen. J. B. Fry.) in the face.</p>
<p>But at the time, exactly what had taken place just before the</p>
<p>shooting was shrouded in mystery by a hundred conflicting stories,</p>
<p>the principal and most credited of which was that Davis had demanded</p>
<p>from Nelson an apology for language used in the original altercation,</p>
<p>and that Nelson&#x27;s refusal was accompanied by a slap in the face, at</p>
<p>the same moment denouncing Davis as a coward.  However this may be,</p>
<p>Nelson, after slapping Davis, moved toward the corridor, from which a</p>
<p>stairway led to the second floor, and just as he was about to ascend,</p>
<p>Davis fired with a pistol that he had obtained from some one near by</p>
<p>after the blow had been struck.  The ball entered Nelson&#x27;s breast</p>
<p>just above the heart, but his great strength enabled him to ascend</p>
<p>the stairway notwithstanding the mortal character of the wound, and</p>
<p>he did not fall till he reached the corridor on the second floor.  He</p>
<p>died about half an hour later.  The tragedy cast a deep gloom over</p>
<p>all who knew the men, for they both had many warm personal friends;</p>
<p>and affairs at Louisville had hardly recovered as yet from the</p>
<p>confused and discouraging condition which preceded the arrival of</p>
<p>General Buell&#x27;s army.  General Buell reported the killing of Nelson</p>
<p>to the authorities at Washington, and recommended the trial of Davis</p>
<p>by court-martial, but no proceedings were ever instituted against him</p>
<p>in either a civil or military court, so to this day it has not been</p>
<p>determined judicially who was the aggressor.  Some months later Davis</p>
<p>was assigned to the command of a division in Buell&#x27;s army after that</p>
<p>officer had been relieved from its command.</p>
<p>Two Confederate armies, under General Kirby Smith and General Braxton</p>
<p>Bragg, had penetrated into Kentucky, the one under Smith by the way</p>
<p>of Cumberland Gap, the other and main army under Bragg by way of the</p>
<p>Sequatche Valley, Glasgow, and Mumfordsville.  Glasgow was captured</p>
<p>by the enemy on the 17th of September, and as the expectation was</p>
<p>that Buell would reach the place in time to save the town, its loss</p>
<p>created considerable alarm in the North, for fears were now</p>
<p>entertained that Bragg would strike Louisville and capture the city</p>
<p>before Buell could arrive on the ground.  It became necessary</p>
<p>therefore to put Louisville in a state of defense, and after the</p>
<p>cordon of principal works had been indicated, my troops threw up in</p>
<p>one night a heavy line of rifle-pits south of the city, from the</p>
<p>Bardstown pike to the river.  The apprehended attack by Bragg never</p>
<p>came, however, for in the race that was then going on between him and</p>
<p>Buell on parallel roads, the Army of the Ohio outmarched the</p>
<p>Confederates, its advance arriving at Louisville September 25.</p>
<p>General Buell immediately set about reorganizing the whole force, and</p>
<p>on September 29 issued an order designating the troops under my</p>
<p>command as the Eleventh Division, Army of the Ohio, and assigning</p>
<p>Brigadier-General J. T. Boyle to command the division, and me to</p>
<p>command one of its brigades.  To this I could not object, of course,</p>
<p>for I was a brigadier-general of very recent date, and could hardly</p>
<p>expect more than a brigade.  I had learned, however, that at least</p>
<p>one officer to whom a high command had been given--a corps--had not</p>
<p>yet been appointed a general officer by the President, and I</p>
<p>considered it somewhat unfair that I should be relegated to a</p>
<p>brigade, while men who held no commissions at all were being made</p>
<p>chiefs of corps and divisions; so I sought an interview with General</p>
<p>Buell&#x27;s chief-of-staff, Colonel Fry, and, while not questioning</p>
<p>Buell&#x27;s good intentions nor his pure motives, insisted that my rights</p>
<p>in the matter should be recognized.  That same evening I was assigned</p>
<p>to the command of the Eleventh Division, and began preparing it at</p>
<p>once for a forward movement, which I knew must soon take place in the</p>
<p>resumption of offensive operations by the Army of the Ohio.</p>
<p>During the interval from September 25 till October 1 there was among</p>
<p>the officers much criticism of General Buell&#x27;s management of the</p>
<p>recent campaign, which had resulted in his retirement to Louisville;</p>
<p>and he was particularly censured by many for not offering battle to</p>
<p>General Bragg while the two armies were marching parallel to each</p>
<p>other, and so near that an engagement could have been brought on at</p>
<p>any one of several points--notably so at Glasgow, Kentucky, if there</p>
<p>had been a desire to join issue.  It was asserted, and by many</p>
<p>conceded, that General Buell had a sufficient force to risk a fight.</p>
<p>He was much blamed for the loss of Mumfordsville also.  The capture</p>
<p>of this point, with its garrison, gave Bragg an advantage in the race</p>
<p>toward the Ohio River, which odds would most likely have ensured the</p>
<p>fall of Louisville had they been used with the same energy and skill</p>
<p>that the Confederate commander displayed from Chattanooga to Glasgow;</p>
<p>but something always diverted General Bragg at the supreme moment,</p>
<p>and he failed to utilize the chances falling to him at this time,</p>
<p>for, deflecting his march to the north toward Bardstown, he left open</p>
<p>to Buell the direct road to Louisville by way of Elizabethtown.</p>
<p>At Bardstown Bragg&#x27;s army was halted while he endeavored to establish</p>
<p>a Confederate government in Kentucky by arranging for the</p>
<p>installation of a provisional governor at Lexington.  Bragg had been</p>
<p>assured that the presence of a Confederate army in Kentucky would so</p>
<p>encourage the secession element that the whole State could be forced</p>
<p>into the rebellion and his army thereby largely increased; but he had</p>
<p>been considerably misled, for he now found that though much latent</p>
<p>sympathy existed for his cause, yet as far as giving active aid was</p>
<p>concerned, the enthusiasm exhibited by the secessionists of Kentucky</p>
<p>in the first year of the war was now replaced by apathy, or at best</p>
<p>by lukewarmness.  So the time thus spent in political machinations</p>
<p>was wholly lost to Bragg; and so little reinforcement was added to</p>
<p>his army that it may be said that the recruits gained were not enough</p>
<p>to supply the deficiencies resulting from the recent toilsome marches</p>
<p>of the campaign.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Buell had arrived at Louisville, system had been</p>
<p>substituted for the chaos which had previously obtained there, and</p>
<p>orders were issued for an advance upon the enemy with the purpose of</p>
<p>attacking and the hope of destroying him within the limits of the</p>
<p>&quot;blue grass&quot; region, and, failing in that, to drive him from</p>
<p>Kentucky.  The army moved October 1, 1862, and my division, now a</p>
<p>part of the Third Corps, commanded by General C. C. Gilbert, marched</p>
<p>directly on Bardstown, where it was thought the enemy would make a</p>
<p>stand, but Bragg&#x27;s troops retreated toward Perryville, only resisting</p>
<p>sufficiently to enable the forces of General Kirby Smith to be drawn</p>
<p>in closer--they having begun a concentration at Frankfort--so they</p>
<p>could be used in a combined attack on Louisville as soon as the</p>
<p>Confederate commander&#x27;s political projects were perfected.</p>
<p>Much time was consumed by Buell&#x27;s army in its march on Perryville,</p>
<p>but we finally neared it on the evening of October 7.  During the</p>
<p>day, Brigadier-General Robert B. Mitchell&#x27;s division of Gilbert&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps was in the advance on the Springfield pike, but as the enemy</p>
<p>developed that he was in strong force on the opposite side of a small</p>
<p>stream called Doctor&#x27;s Creek, a tributary of Chaplin River, my</p>
<p>division was brought up and passed to the front.  It was very</p>
<p>difficult to obtain water in this section of Kentucky, as a drought</p>
<p>had prevailed for many weeks, and the troops were suffering so for</p>
<p>water that it became absolutely necessary that we should gain</p>
<p>possession of Doctor&#x27;s Creek in order to relieve their distress.</p>
<p>Consequently General Gilbert, during the night, directed me to push</p>
<p>beyond Doctor&#x27;s Creek early the next morning.  At daylight on the 8th</p>
<p>I moved out Colonel Dan McCook&#x27;s brigade and Barnett&#x27;s battery for</p>
<p>the purpose, but after we had crossed the creek with some slight</p>
<p>skirmishing, I found that we could not hold the ground unless we</p>
<p>carried and occupied a range of hills, called Chaplin Heights, in</p>
<p>front of Chaplin River.  As this would project my command in the</p>
<p>direction of Perryville considerably beyond the troops that were on</p>
<p>either flank, I brought up Laiboldt&#x27;s brigade and Hescock&#x27;s battery</p>
<p>to strengthen Colonel McCook.  Putting both brigades into line we</p>
<p>quickly carried the Heights, much to the surprise of the enemy, I</p>
<p>think, for he did not hold on to the valuable ground as strongly as</p>
<p>he should have done.  This success not only ensured us a good supply</p>
<p>of water, but also, later in the day, had an important bearing in the</p>
<p>battle of Perryville.  After taking the Heights, I brought up the</p>
<p>rest of my division and intrenched, without much difficulty, by</p>
<p>throwing up a strong line of rifle-pits, although the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>sharpshooters annoyed us enough to make me order Laiboldt&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>to drive them in on the main body.  This was successfully done in a</p>
<p>few minutes, but in pushing them back to Chaplin River, we discovered</p>
<p>the Confederates forming a line of battle on the opposite bank, with</p>
<p>the apparent purpose of an attack in force, so I withdrew the brigade</p>
<p>to our intrenchments on the crest and there awaited the assault.</p>
<p>While this skirmishing was going on, General Gilbert--the corps</p>
<p>commander--whose headquarters were located on a hill about a mile</p>
<p>distant to the rear, kept sending me messages by signal not to bring</p>
<p>on an engagement.  I replied to each message that I was not bringing</p>
<p>on an engagement, but that the enemy evidently intended to do so, and</p>
<p>that I believed I should shortly be attacked.  Soon after returning</p>
<p>to the crest and getting snugly fixed in the rifle-pits, my attention</p>
<p>was called to our left, the high ground we occupied affording me in</p>
<p>that direction an unobstructed view.  I then saw General A. McD.</p>
<p>McCook&#x27;s corps--the First-advancing toward Chaplin River by the</p>
<p>Mackville road, apparently unconscious that the Confederates were</p>
<p>present in force behind the stream.  I tried by the use of signal</p>
<p>flags to get information of the situation to these troops, but my</p>
<p>efforts failed, and the leading regiments seemed to approach the</p>
<p>river indifferently prepared to meet the sudden attack that speedily</p>
<p>followed, delivered as it was from the chosen position of the enemy.</p>
<p>The fury of the Confederate assault soon halted this advance force,</p>
<p>and in a short time threw it into confusion, pushed it back a</p>
<p>considerable distance, and ultimately inflicted upon it such loss of</p>
<p>men and guns as to seriously cripple McCook&#x27;s corps, and prevent for</p>
<p>the whole day further offensive movement on his part, though he</p>
<p>stoutly resisted the enemy&#x27;s assaults until 4 o&#x27;clock in the</p>
<p>afternoon.</p>
<p>Seeing McCook so fiercely attacked, in order to aid him I advanced</p>
<p>Hescock&#x27;s battery, supported by six regiments, to a very good</p>
<p>position in front of a belt of timber on my extreme left, where an</p>
<p>enfilading fire could be opened on that portion of the enemy</p>
<p>attacking the right of the First Corps, and also on his batteries</p>
<p>across Chaplin River.  But at this juncture he placed two batteries</p>
<p>on my right and began to mass troops behind them, and General</p>
<p>Gilbert, fearing that my intrenched position on the heights might be</p>
<p>carried, directed me to withdraw Hescock and his supports and return</p>
<p>them to the pits.  My recall was opportune, for I had no sooner got</p>
<p>back to my original line than the Confederates attacked me furiously,</p>
<p>advancing almost to my intrenchments, notwithstanding that a large</p>
<p>part of the ground over which they had to move was swept by a heavy</p>
<p>fire of canister from both my batteries.  Before they had quite</p>
<p>reached us, however, our telling fire made them recoil, and as they</p>
<p>fell back, I directed an advance of my whole division, bringing up my</p>
<p>reserve regiments to occupy the crest of the hills; Colonel William</p>
<p>P. Carlin&#x27;s brigade of Mitchell&#x27;s division meanwhile moving forward</p>
<p>on my right to cover that flank.  This advance pressed the enemy to</p>
<p>Perryville, but he retired in such good order that we gained nothing</p>
<p>but some favorable ground that enabled me to establish my batteries</p>
<p>in positions where they could again turn their attention to the</p>
<p>Confederates in front of McCook, whose critical condition was shortly</p>
<p>after relieved, however, by a united pressure of Gilbert&#x27;s corps</p>
<p>against the flank of McCook&#x27;s assailants, compelling them to retire</p>
<p>behind Chaplin River.</p>
<p>The battle virtually ended about 4 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, though</p>
<p>more or less desultory firing continued until dark.  Considering the</p>
<p>severity of the engagement on McCook&#x27;s front, and the reverses that</p>
<p>had befallen him, I question if, from that part of the line, much</p>
<p>could have been done toward retrieving the blunders of the day, but</p>
<p>it did seem to me that, had the commander of the army been able to be</p>
<p>present on the field, he could have taken advantage of Bragg&#x27;s final</p>
<p>repulse, and there would have remained in our hands more than the</p>
<p>barren field.  But no attempt was made to do anything more till next</p>
<p>morning, and then we secured little except the enemy&#x27;s killed and</p>
<p>most severely wounded.</p>
<p>The operations of my division during the engagement pleased.  General</p>
<p>Gilbert very much, and he informed me that he would relax a rigidly</p>
<p>enforced order which General Buell had issued some days before,</p>
<p>sufficiently to permit my trains to come to the front and supply my</p>
<p>almost starving troops with rations.  The order in question was one</p>
<p>of those issued, doubtless with a good intent, to secure generally</p>
<p>the safety of our trains, but General Gilbert was not elastic, and on</p>
<p>the march he had construed the order so illiberally that it was next</p>
<p>to impossible to supply the men with food, and they were particularly</p>
<p>short in this respect on the eve of the battle.  I had then</p>
<p>endeavored to persuade him to modify his iron-clad interpretation of</p>
<p>the order, but without effect, and the only wagons we could bring up</p>
<p>from the general parks in rear were ambulances and those containing</p>
<p>ammunition.  So to gain access to our trains was a great boon, and at</p>
<p>that moment a more welcome result than would have been a complete</p>
<p>victory minus this concession.</p>
<p>When the battle ceased General Gilbert asked me to join him at</p>
<p>Buell&#x27;s headquarters, which were a considerable distance to the rear,</p>
<p>so after making some dispositions for the evening I proceeded there</p>
<p>as requested.  I arrived just as Buell was about to sit down to his</p>
<p>supper, and noticing that he was lame, then learned that he had been</p>
<p>severely injured by a recent fall from his horse.  He kindly invited</p>
<p>me to join him at the table, an invitation which I accepted with</p>
<p>alacrity, enjoying the meal with a relish known only to a very-hungry</p>
<p>man, for I had eaten nothing since morning.  Of course the events of</p>
<p>the day were the chief topic of discussion--as they were during my</p>
<p>stay at headquarters--but the conversation indicated that what had</p>
<p>occurred was not fully realized, and I returned to my troops</p>
<p>impressed with the belief that General Buell and his staff-officers</p>
<p>were unconscious of the magnitude of the battle that had just been</p>
<p>fought.</p>
<p>It had been expected by Buell that he would fight the enemy on the</p>
<p>9th of October, but the Confederates disposed of that proposition by</p>
<p>attacking us on the 8th, thus disarranging a tactical conception</p>
<p>which, with our superior numbers, would doubtless have proved</p>
<p>successful had it not been anticipated by an enterprising foe.</p>
<p>During the battle on the 8th the Second Corps, under General Thomas</p>
<p>L. Crittenden, accompanied by General George H. Thomas, lay idle the</p>
<p>whole day for want of orders, although it was near enough to the</p>
<p>field to take an active part in the fight; and, moreover, a large</p>
<p>part of Gilbert&#x27;s corps was unengaged during the pressure on McCook.</p>
<p>Had these troops been put in on the enemy&#x27;s left at any time after he</p>
<p>assaulted McCook, success would have been beyond question; but there</p>
<p>was no one on the ground authorized to take advantage of the</p>
<p>situation, and the battle of Perryville remains in history an example</p>
<p>of lost opportunities.  This was due in some measure probably to</p>
<p>General Buell&#x27;s accident, but is mainly attributable to the fact that</p>
<p>he did not clearly apprehend Bragg&#x27;s aim, which was to gain time to</p>
<p>withdraw behind Dick&#x27;s River all the troops he had in Kentucky, for</p>
<p>the Confederate general had no idea of risking the fate of his army</p>
<p>on one general battle at a place or on a day to be chosen by the</p>
<p>Union commander.</p>
<p>Considering the number of troops actually engaged, the losses to</p>
<p>Buell were severe, amounting to something over five thousand in</p>
<p>killed, wounded, and missing.  Among the killed were two brigade</p>
<p>commanders of much promise--General James S. Jackson and General</p>
<p>William R. Terrill.  McCook&#x27;s corps lost twelve guns, some of which</p>
<p>were recovered next day.  The enemy&#x27;s loss in killed and wounded we</p>
<p>never learned, but it must have equalled ours; and about four</p>
<p>thousand prisoners, consisting principally of sick and wounded, fell</p>
<p>into our hands.  In the first report of the battle sent North to the</p>
<p>newspapers I was reported among the killed; but I was pleased to</p>
<p>notice, when the papers reached us a few days later, that the error</p>
<p>had been corrected before my obituary could be written.</p>
<p>The enemy retired from our front the night of the 8th, falling back</p>
<p>on Harrodsburg to form a junction with Kirby Smith, and by taking</p>
<p>this line of retreat opened to us the road to Danville and the chance</p>
<p>for a direct march against his depot of supplies at Bryantsville.  We</p>
<p>did not take advantage of this opening, however, and late in the day-</p>
<p>-on the 9th--my division marched in pursuit, in the direction of</p>
<p>Harrodsburg, which was the apex of a triangle having for its base a</p>
<p>line from Perryville to Danville.  The pursuit was slow, very slow,</p>
<p>consuming the evening of the 9th and all of the l0th and 11th.  By</p>
<p>cutting across the triangle spoken of above, just south of the apex,</p>
<p>I struck the Harrodsburg-Danville road, near Cave Springs, joining</p>
<p>there Gilbert&#x27;s left division, which had preceded me and marched</p>
<p>through Harrodsburg.  Here we again rested until the intention of the</p>
<p>enemy could be divined, and we could learn on which side of Dick&#x27;s</p>
<p>River he would give us battle.  A reconnoissance sent toward the</p>
<p>Dickville crossing developed to a certainty that we should not have</p>
<p>another engagement, however; for it disclosed the fact that Bragg&#x27;s</p>
<p>army had disappeared toward Camp Dick Robinson, leaving only a small</p>
<p>rear-guard at Danville, which in turn quickly fled in the direction</p>
<p>of Lancaster, after exchanging a few shots with Hescock&#x27;s battery.</p>
<p>While this parting salute of deadly projectiles was going on, a</p>
<p>little, daughter of Colonel William J. Landram, whose home was in</p>
<p>Danville, came running out from his house and planted a small</p>
<p>national flag on one of Hescock&#x27;s guns.  The patriotic act was so</p>
<p>brave and touching that it thrilled all who witnessed the scene; and</p>
<p>until the close of the war, when peace separated the surviving</p>
<p>officers and men of the battery, that little flag was protected and</p>
<p>cherished as a memento of the Perryville campaign.</p>
<p>Pursuit of the enemy was not continued in force beyond Crab Orchard,</p>
<p>but some portions of the army kept at Bragg&#x27;s heels until he crossed</p>
<p>the Cumberland River, a part of his troops retiring to Tennessee by</p>
<p>way of Cumberland Gap, but the major portion through Somerset.  As</p>
<p>the retreat of Bragg transferred the theatre of operations back to</p>
<p>Tennessee, orders were now issued for a concentration of Buell&#x27;s army</p>
<p>at Bowling Green, with a view to marching it to Nashville, and my</p>
<p>division moved to that point without noteworthy incident.  I reached</p>
<p>Bowling Green with a force much reduced by the losses sustained in</p>
<p>the battle of Perryville and by sickness.  I had started from</p>
<p>Louisville on October 1 with twelve regiments of infantry--four old</p>
<p>and eight new ones--and two batteries, but many poor fellows,</p>
<p>overcome by fatigue, and diseases induced by the heat, dust, and</p>
<p>drought of the season, had to be left at roadside hospitals.  This</p>
<p>was particularly the case with the new regiments, the men of which,</p>
<p>much depressed by homesickness, and not yet inured to campaigning,</p>
<p>fell easy victims to the hardships of war.</p>
<p>At Bowling Green General Buell was relieved, General W. S. Rosecrans</p>
<p>succeeding him.  The army as a whole did not manifest much regret at</p>
<p>the change of commanders, for the campaign from Louisville on was</p>
<p>looked upon generally as a lamentable failure, yet there were many</p>
<p>who still had the utmost confidence in General Buell, and they</p>
<p>repelled with some asperity the reflections cast upon him by his</p>
<p>critics.  These admirers held him blameless throughout for the</p>
<p>blunders of the campaign, but the greater number laid every error at</p>
<p>his door, and even went to the absurdity of challenging his loyalty</p>
<p>in a mild way, but they particularly charged incompetency at</p>
<p>Perryville, where McCook&#x27;s corps was so badly crippled while nearly</p>
<p>30,000 Union troops were idle on the field, or within striking</p>
<p>distance.  With these it was no use to argue that Buell&#x27;s accident</p>
<p>stood in the way of his activity, nor that he did not know that the</p>
<p>action had assumed the proportions of a battle.  The physical</p>
<p>disability was denied or contested, but even granting this, his</p>
<p>detractors claimed that it did not excuse his ignorance of the true</p>
<p>condition of the fight, and finally worsted his champions by pointing</p>
<p>out that Bragg&#x27;s retreat by way of Harrodsburg beyond Dick&#x27;s River so</p>
<p>jeopardized the Confederate army, that had a skillful and energetic</p>
<p>advance of the Union troops been made, instead of wasting precious</p>
<p>time in slow and unnecessary tactical manoeuvres, the enemy could</p>
<p>have been destroyed before he could quit the State of Kentucky.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>
<p>MOVING TO BOWLING GREEN--JAMES CARD, THE SCOUT AND GUIDE--GENERAL</p>
<p>SILL--COLONEL SCHAEFER--COLONEL G. W. ROBERTS--MOVEMENT ON</p>
<p>MURFREESBORO&#x27;--OPENING OF THE BATTLE OF STONE RIVER.</p>
<p>My division had moved from Crab Orchard to Bowling Green by easy</p>
<p>marches, reaching this place November 1. General Rosecrans assumed</p>
<p>command of the department October 30, at Louisville, and joined the</p>
<p>army November 2.  There had been much pressure brought to bear on</p>
<p>General Buell to induce him to take measures looking to the occupancy</p>
<p>of East Tennessee, and the clamor to this end from Washington still</p>
<p>continued; but now that Bragg was south of the Cumberland River, in a</p>
<p>position threatening Nashville, which was garrisoned by but a small</p>
<p>force, it was apparent to every one at all conversant with the</p>
<p>situation that a battle would have to be fought somewhere in Middle</p>
<p>Tennessee.  So, notwithstanding the pressure from Washington, the</p>
<p>army was soon put in motion for Nashville, and when we arrived there</p>
<p>my division went into camp north of the river, on a plateau just</p>
<p>outside the little town of Edgefield, until the movements of the</p>
<p>enemy should be further developed.</p>
<p>While in this camp, on the plantation of Mr. Hobson, there came to my</p>
<p>headquarters one morning an East Tennessean named James Card, who</p>
<p>offered to the Union cause his services in any capacity in which they</p>
<p>might be made useful.  This offer, and the relation of his personal</p>
<p>history, were given with such sincerity of speech and manner that in</p>
<p>a short time I became convinced of his honesty of purpose.  He was a</p>
<p>small, active, busy man, with a determined way about him, and his</p>
<p>countenance indicated great intelligence.  He gave minute information</p>
<p>that was of inestimable value to me regarding East and Middle</p>
<p>Tennessee and northern Georgia, for, with a view to the army&#x27;s future</p>
<p>movements, I was then making a study of the topography of this</p>
<p>region, and posting myself as to Middle Tennessee, for all knew this</p>
<p>would be the scene of active operations whenever the campaign was</p>
<p>resumed.  This man, like most of the East Tennesseans whom I had met,</p>
<p>was intensely loyal and patriotic, and the interview led in a few</p>
<p>days to his employment as a scout and guide, and subsequently to the</p>
<p>engaging in the same capacity of two of his brothers, who were good</p>
<p>men; but not quite as active nor so intelligent as he was.  Card had</p>
<p>been a colporter, having pedled books, especially religious tracts,</p>
<p>over all Middle and East Tennessee and Georgia, assisted by his</p>
<p>brothers at times, and was therefore thoroughly familiar with these</p>
<p>regions, their roads and inhabitants.  He also preached to country</p>
<p>congregations occasionally, when ministers were scarce, and I have no</p>
<p>doubt often performed the functions of family physician in the</p>
<p>mountain district.  Thus his opportunities were great; and the loyal</p>
<p>people in every section of the country being well known to him and</p>
<p>his brothers, the three began, at this time, a system of scouting and</p>
<p>investigation which bore its first-fruits in specifically locating</p>
<p>the different divisions of Bragg&#x27;s army, with statements of their</p>
<p>strength and condition, and all with so much accuracy that I</p>
<p>thereafter felt reasonably sure that I could at all times procure</p>
<p>such knowledge of the enemy&#x27;s operations as would well equip me for</p>
<p>any contingency that might arise.</p>
<p>By the middle of November the enemy, having assembled his forces in</p>
<p>Middle Tennessee, showed considerable boldness, and it became</p>
<p>necessary to rearrange the Union lines; so my troops were moved to</p>
<p>the south side of the river, out on the Murfreesboro&#x27; pike, to Mill</p>
<p>Creek, distant from Nashville about seven miles.  While we were in</p>
<p>camp on Mill Creek the army was reorganized, and General Joshua W.</p>
<p>Sill, at his own request, was assigned to my division, and took</p>
<p>command of Colonel Nicholas Greusel&#x27;s brigade.  My division became at</p>
<p>the same time the Third Division, Right Wing, Fourteenth Army Corps,</p>
<p>its three brigades of four regiments each being respectively</p>
<p>commanded by General Sill, Colonel Frederick Schaefer and Colonel Dan</p>
<p>McCook; but a few days later Colonel George W. Roberts&#x27;s brigade,</p>
<p>from the garrison at Nashville, was substituted for McCook&#x27;s.</p>
<p>General Sill was a classmate of mine at the Military Academy, having</p>
<p>graduated in 1853.  On graduating he was appointed to the Ordnance</p>
<p>Corps, and served in that department at various arsenals and ordnance</p>
<p>depots throughout the country till early in 1861, when he resigned to</p>
<p>accept a professorship of mathematics and civil engineering at the</p>
<p>Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute.  At the breaking out</p>
<p>of the war he immediately tendered his services to the Government,</p>
<p>and soon rose to the colonelcy of the Thirty-Third Ohio Volunteers,</p>
<p>and afterward to the rank of brigadier-general.  I knew him well, and</p>
<p>was glad that he came to my division, though I was very loth to</p>
<p>relieve Colonel Greusel, of the Thirty-Sixth Illinois, who had</p>
<p>already indicated much military skill and bravery, and at the battle</p>
<p>of Perryville had handled his men with the experience of a veteran.</p>
<p>Sill&#x27;s modesty and courage were exceeded only by a capacity that had</p>
<p>already been demonstrated in many practical ways, and his untimely</p>
<p>death, almost within a month of his joining me, abruptly closed a</p>
<p>career which, had it been prolonged a little more, not only would</p>
<p>have shed additional lustre on his name, but would have been of</p>
<p>marked benefit to his country.</p>
<p>Colonel Schaefer, of the Second Missouri Infantry, had been absent on</p>
<p>sick-leave during the Kentucky campaign, but about this date he</p>
<p>returned to duty, and by seniority fell in command of the second</p>
<p>brigade.  He was of German birth, having come from Baden, where,</p>
<p>prior to 1848, he had been a non-commissioned officer in the service</p>
<p>of his State.  He took part as an insurgent in the so-called</p>
<p>revolution which occurred at Baden in that year, and, compelled to</p>
<p>emigrate on the suppression of the insurrection, made his way to this</p>
<p>country and settled in St. Louis.  Here the breaking out of the war</p>
<p>found him, and through the personal interest which General Sigel took</p>
<p>in him he was commissioned a colonel of volunteers.  He had had a</p>
<p>pretty fair education, a taste for the military profession, and was</p>
<p>of tall and slender build, all of which gave him a student-like</p>
<p>appearance.  He was extremely excitable and nervous when anticipating</p>
<p>a crisis, but always calmed down to cool deliberation when the</p>
<p>critical moment came.  With such a man I could not be less than well</p>
<p>satisfied, although the officer whom he replaced--Colonel Laiboldt--</p>
<p>had performed efficient service and shown much capacity in the recent</p>
<p>campaign.</p>
<p>Colonel G. W. Roberts, of the Forty-Second Illinois Infantry, also</p>
<p>came to me in the reorganization.  He was an ideal soldier both in</p>
<p>mind and body.  He was young, tall, handsome, brave, and dashing, and</p>
<p>possessed a balance-wheel of such good judgment that in his sphere of</p>
<p>action no occasion could arise from which he would not reap the best</p>
<p>results.  But he too was destined to lay, down his life within a few</p>
<p>days, and on the same fatal field.  His brigade had been performing</p>
<p>garrison duty in Nashville during the siege of that city while</p>
<p>Buell&#x27;s army was in Kentucky, but disliking the prospect of</p>
<p>inactivity pending the operations opening before us, Roberts had</p>
<p>requested and obtained a transfer to the army in the field.  His</p>
<p>brigade relieved Colonel Dan McCook&#x27;s, the latter reluctantly joining</p>
<p>the garrison at Nashville, every one in it disappointed and disgusted</p>
<p>that the circumstances existing at this time should necessitate their</p>
<p>relegation to the harassing and tantalizing duty of protecting our</p>
<p>depots and line of supply.</p>
<p>I was fortunate in having such brigade commanders, and no less</p>
<p>favored in the regimental and battery commanders.  They all were not</p>
<p>only patriots, but soldiers, and knowing that discipline must be one</p>
<p>of the most potent factors in bringing to a successful termination,</p>
<p>the mighty contest in which our nation was struggling for existence,</p>
<p>they studied and practiced its methods ceaselessly, inspiring with</p>
<p>the same spirit that pervaded themselves the loyal hearts of their</p>
<p>subordinate officers and men.  All worked unremittingly in the camp</p>
<p>at Mill Creek in preparing for the storm, which now plainly indicated</p>
<p>its speedy coming.  Drills, parades, scouts, foraging expeditions,</p>
<p>picket and guard duty, made up the course in this school of</p>
<p>instruction, supplemented by frequent changes in the locations of the</p>
<p>different brigades, so that the division could have opportunity to</p>
<p>learn to break camp quickly and to move out promptly on the march.</p>
<p>Foraging expeditions were particularly beneficial in this respect,</p>
<p>and when sent out, though absent sometimes for days, the men went</p>
<p>without tents or knapsacks, equipped with only one blanket and their</p>
<p>arms, ammunition, and rations, to teach them to shift for themselves</p>
<p>with slender means in the event of necessity.  The number of</p>
<p>regimental and headquarters wagons was cut down to the lowest</p>
<p>possible figure, and everything made compact by turning into the</p>
<p>supply and ammunition trains of the division all surplus</p>
<p>transportation, and restricting the personal baggage of officers to</p>
<p>the fewest effects possible.</p>
<p>My own staff also was somewhat reorganized and increased at Mill</p>
<p>Creek, and though it had been perfectly satisfactory before, yet, on</p>
<p>account of the changes of troops that had occurred in the command, I</p>
<p>found it necessary to replace valuable officers in some instances,</p>
<p>and secure additional ones in others.  The gathering of information</p>
<p>about the enemy was also industriously pursued, and Card and his</p>
<p>brothers were used constantly on expeditions within the Confederate</p>
<p>lines, frequently visiting Murfreesboro&#x27;, Sparta, Tullahoma,</p>
<p>Shelbyville, and other points.  What they learned was reported to</p>
<p>army headquarters, often orally through me or personally communicated</p>
<p>by Card himself, but much was forwarded in official letters,</p>
<p>beginning with November 24, when I transmitted accurate information</p>
<p>of the concentration of Bragg&#x27;s main force at Tullahoma.  Indeed,</p>
<p>Card kept me so well posted as to every movement of the enemy, not</p>
<p>only with reference to the troops in my immediate front, but also</p>
<p>throughout his whole army, that General Rosecrans placed the most</p>
<p>unreserved reliance on all his statements, and many times used them</p>
<p>to check and correct the reports brought in by his own scouts.</p>
<p>Slight skirmishes took place frequently during this period, and now</p>
<p>and then heavy demonstrations were made in the neighborhood of</p>
<p>Nolensville by reconnoitring parties from both armies, but none of</p>
<p>these ever grew into a battle.  These affairs sprung from the desire</p>
<p>of each side to feel his antagonist, and had little result beyond</p>
<p>emphasizing the fact that behind each line of pickets lay a massed</p>
<p>and powerful army busily preparing for the inevitable conflict and</p>
<p>eager for its opening.  So it wore on till the evening of December</p>
<p>25, 1862; then came the order to move forward.</p>
<p>General Rosecrans, in the reorganization of the army, had assigned</p>
<p>Major-General A. McD. McCook to command the right wing, MajorGeneral</p>
<p>George H. Thomas the centre, and Major-General T. L. Crittenden the</p>
<p>left wing.  McCook&#x27;s wing was made up of three divisions, commanded</p>
<p>in order of rank by Brigadier-General Jeff. C. Davis; Brigadier-</p>
<p>General R. W. Johnson, and Brigadier-General P. H. Sheridan.</p>
<p>Although the corps nomenclature established by General Buell was</p>
<p>dropped, the grand divisions into which he had organized the army at</p>
<p>Louisville were maintained, and, in fact, the conditions established</p>
<p>then remained practically unaltered, with the exception of the</p>
<p>interchange of some brigades, the transfer of a few general officers</p>
<p>from one wing or division to another, and the substitution of General</p>
<p>Thomas for Gilbert as a corps commander.  The army was thus compact</p>
<p>and cohesive, undisturbed by discord and unembarrassed by jealousies</p>
<p>of any moment; and it may be said that under a commander who, we</p>
<p>believed, had the energy and skill necessary to direct us to success,</p>
<p>a national confidence in our invincibility made us all keen for a</p>
<p>test of strength with the Confederates.  We had not long to wait.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of December 26, 1862, in a heavy rain, the army</p>
<p>marched, the movement being directed on Murfreesboro&#x27;, where the</p>
<p>enemy had made some preparation to go into winter-quarters, and to</p>
<p>hold which town it was hoped he would accept battle.  General Thomas</p>
<p>moved by the Franklin and Wilson pikes, General Crittenden by the</p>
<p>Murfreesboro&#x27; pike, through Lavergne, and General McCook by the</p>
<p>Nolensville pike--Davis&#x27;s division in advance.  As McCook&#x27;s command</p>
<p>neared Nolensville, I received a message from Davis informing me that</p>
<p>the Confederates were in considerable force, posted on a range of</p>
<p>hills in his front, and requesting me to support him in an attack he</p>
<p>was about to make.  When the head of my column arrived at Nolensville</p>
<p>I began massing my troops on the right of the road, and by the time</p>
<p>this formation was nearly completed Davis advanced, but not meeting</p>
<p>with sufficient resistance to demand active assistance from me, he</p>
<p>with his own command carried the hills, capturing one piece of</p>
<p>artillery.  This position of the Confederates was a strong one,</p>
<p>defending Knob&#x27;s Gap, through which the Nolensville and Triune pike</p>
<p>passed.  On the 27th Johnson&#x27;s division, followed by mine, advanced</p>
<p>to Triune, and engaged in a severe skirmish near that place, but my</p>
<p>troops were not called into action, the stand made by the enemy being</p>
<p>only for the purpose of gaining time to draw in his outlying troops,</p>
<p>which done, he retired toward Murfreesboro&#x27;.  I remained inactive at</p>
<p>Triune during the 28th, but early on the 29th moved out by the Bole</p>
<p>Jack road to the support of, Davis in his advance to Stewart&#x27;s Creek,</p>
<p>and encamped at Wilkinson&#x27;s crossroads, from which point to</p>
<p>Murfreesboro&#x27;, distant about six miles, there was a good turnpike.</p>
<p>The enemy had sullenly resisted the progress of Crittenden and McCook</p>
<p>throughout the preceding three days, and as it was thought probable</p>
<p>that he might offer battle at Stewart&#x27;s Creek, Thomas, in pursuance</p>
<p>of his original instructions looking to just such a contingency, had</p>
<p>now fallen into the centre by way of the Nolensville crossroads.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3oth I had the advance of McCook&#x27;s corps on the</p>
<p>Wilkinson pike, Roberts&#x27;s brigade leading.  At first only slight</p>
<p>skirmishing took place, but when we came within about three miles of</p>
<p>Murfreesboro&#x27; the resistance of the enemy&#x27;s pickets grew serious, and</p>
<p>a little further on so strong that I had to put in two regiments to</p>
<p>push them back.  I succeeded in driving them about half a mile, when</p>
<p>I was directed by McCook to form line of battle and place my</p>
<p>artillery in position so that I could act in concert with Davis&#x27;s</p>
<p>division, which he wished to post on my right in the general line he</p>
<p>desired to take up.  In obedience to these directions I deployed on</p>
<p>the right of, and oblique to the Wilkinson pike, with a front of four</p>
<p>regiments, a second line of four regiments within short supporting</p>
<p>distance, and a reserve of one brigade in column of regiments to the</p>
<p>rear of my centre.  All this time the enemy kept up a heavy artillery</p>
<p>and musketry fire on my skirmishers, he occupying, with his</p>
<p>sharpshooters, beyond some open fields, a heavy belt of timber to my</p>
<p>front and right, where it was intended the left of Davis should</p>
<p>finally rest.  To gain this point Davis was ordered to swing his</p>
<p>division into it in conjunction with a wheeling movement of my right</p>
<p>brigade, until our continuous line should face nearly due east.  This</p>
<p>would give us possession of the timber referred to, and not only rid</p>
<p>us of the annoying fire from the skirmishers screened by it, but also</p>
<p>place us close in to what was now developing as Bragg&#x27;s line of</p>
<p>battle.  The movement was begun about half-past 2, and was</p>
<p>successfully executed, after a stubborn resistance.  In this</p>
<p>preliminary affair the enemy had put in one battery of artillery,</p>
<p>which was silenced in a little while, however, by Bush&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Hescock&#x27;s guns.  By sundown I had taken up my prescribed position,</p>
<p>facing almost east, my left (Roberts&#x27;s brigade) resting on the</p>
<p>Wilkinson pike, the right (Sill&#x27;s brigade) in the timber we had just</p>
<p>gained, and the reserve brigade (Schaefer&#x27;s) to the rear of my</p>
<p>centre, on some rising ground in the edge of a strip of woods behind</p>
<p>Houghtaling&#x27;s and Hescock&#x27;s batteries.  Davis&#x27;s division was placed</p>
<p>in position on my right, his troops thrown somewhat to the rear, so</p>
<p>that his line formed nearly a right angle with mine, while Johnson&#x27;s</p>
<p>division formed in a very exposed position on the right of Davis,</p>
<p>prolonging the general line just across the Franklin pike.</p>
<p>The centre, under Thomas, had already formed to my left, the right of</p>
<p>Negley&#x27;s division joining my left in a cedar thicket near the</p>
<p>Wilkinson pike, while Crittenden&#x27;s corps was posted on the left of</p>
<p>Thomas, his left resting on Stone River, at a point about two miles</p>
<p>and a half from Murfreesboro&#x27;.</p>
<p>The precision that had characterized every manoeuvre of the past</p>
<p>three days, and the exactness with which each corps and division fell</p>
<p>into its allotted place on the evening of the 30th, indicated that at</p>
<p>the outset of the campaign a well-digested plan of operations had</p>
<p>been prepared for us; and although the scheme of the expected battle</p>
<p>was not known to subordinates of my grade, yet all the movements up</p>
<p>to this time had been so successfully and accurately made as to give</p>
<p>much promise for the morrow, and when night fell there was general</p>
<p>anticipation of the best results to the Union army.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>
<p>ASSAULT ON OUR RIGHT FLANK--OCCUPYING A NEW POSITION--THE ENEMY</p>
<p>CHECKED--TERRIBLE LOSS OF OFFICERS--AMMUNITION GIVES OUT--</p>
<p>RECONSTRUCTING THE LINE--COLLECTING THE WOUNDED AND BURYING THE DEAD-</p>
<p>-DEALING WITH COWARDS--RESULTS OF THE VICTORY.</p>
<p>The enemy under Bragg lay between us and stone River in order of</p>
<p>battle, his general line conforming to the course of that stream. In</p>
<p>my immediate front he appeared to be established in strong force in a</p>
<p>dense cedar wood, just beyond an open valley, which varied from two</p>
<p>hundred to four hundred yards in width, the cedars extending the</p>
<p>entire length of the valley.  From the events of the day and evening</p>
<p>of the 3oth, it was apparent that the two armies were in close</p>
<p>proximity, and orders received during the night revealed the fact</p>
<p>that Rosecrans intended to attack by throwing his left on the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>right, with the expectation of driving it in toward Murfreesboro&#x27;, so</p>
<p>that the right of Crittenden&#x27;s corps could attack Bragg&#x27;s centre in</p>
<p>reverse, while Thomas supported Crittenden by a simultaneous front</p>
<p>assault; and from the movements of the enemy at daylight next</p>
<p>morning, it was plainly indicated that Bragg had planned to swing his</p>
<p>left on our right by an exactly similar manoeuvre, get possession of</p>
<p>the railroad and the Nashville pike, and if possible cut us off from</p>
<p>our base at Nashville.  The conceptions in the minds of the two</p>
<p>generals were almost identical; but Bragg took the initiative,</p>
<p>beginning his movement about an hour earlier than the time set by</p>
<p>Rosecrans, which gained him an immense advantage in execution in the</p>
<p>earlier stages of the action.</p>
<p>During the evening of the th, feeling keenly all the solicitude which</p>
<p>attends one in anticipation of a battle, I examined my position with</p>
<p>great care, inspecting its whole length several times to remedy any</p>
<p>defects that might exist, and to let the men see that I was alive to</p>
<p>their interests and advantages.  After dark, I went back to the rear</p>
<p>of my reserve brigade, and establishing my headquarters behind the</p>
<p>trunk of a large fallen tree, which would shelter me somewhat from</p>
<p>the cold December wind, lay down beside a small camp-fire to get some</p>
<p>rest.</p>
<p>At 2 o&#x27;clock on the morning of the 31st General Sill came back to me</p>
<p>to report that on his front a continuous movement of infantry and</p>
<p>artillery had been going on all night within the Confederate lines,</p>
<p>and that he was convinced that Bragg was massing on our right with</p>
<p>the purpose of making an attack from that direction early in the</p>
<p>morning.  After discussing for a few minutes the probabilities of</p>
<p>such a course on the part of the enemy, I thought McCook should be</p>
<p>made acquainted with what was going on, so Sill and I went back to</p>
<p>see him at his headquarters, not far from the Griscom House, where we</p>
<p>found him sleeping on some straw in the angle of a worm-fence.  I</p>
<p>waked him up and communicated the intelligence, and our consequent</p>
<p>impressions.  He talked the matter over with us for some little time,</p>
<p>but in view of the offensive-defensive part he was to play in the</p>
<p>coming battle, did not seem to think that there was a necessity for</p>
<p>any further dispositions than had already been taken.  He said that</p>
<p>he thought Johnson&#x27;s division would be able to take care of the</p>
<p>right, and seemed confident that the early assault which was to be</p>
<p>made from Rosecrans&#x27;s left would anticipate and check the designs</p>
<p>which we presaged.  We two then returned to my little camp-fire</p>
<p>behind the log, and as we continued talking of what might be expected</p>
<p>from the indications on the right, and Sill becoming more anxious, I</p>
<p>directed two regiments from the reserve to report to him, that they</p>
<p>might be placed within very short supporting distance of his line.</p>
<p>He then rejoined his brigade, better satisfied, but still adhering to</p>
<p>the belief he had expressed when first making his report.</p>
<p>Long before dawn my division breakfasted, and was assembled under</p>
<p>arms, the infantry in line, the cannoneers at their pieces, but while</p>
<p>we were thus preparing, all the recent signs of activity in the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s camp were hushed, a death-like stillness prevailing in the</p>
<p>cedars to our front.  Shortly after daylight General Hardee opened</p>
<p>the engagement, just as Sill had predicted, by a fierce attack on</p>
<p>Johnson&#x27;s division, the extreme right of the Union line.  Immediate</p>
<p>success attending this assault, Hardee extended the attack gradually</p>
<p>along in front of Davis, hip movement taking the form of a wheel to</p>
<p>the right, the pivot being nearly opposite the left of my division.</p>
<p>Johnson&#x27;s division soon gave way, and two of Davis&#x27;s brigades were</p>
<p>forced to fall back with it, though stubbornly resisting the</p>
<p>determined and sweeping onset.</p>
<p>In the meantime the enemy had also attacked me, advancing across an</p>
<p>old cotton-field in Sill&#x27;s front in heavy masses, which were</p>
<p>furiously opened upon by Bush&#x27;s battery from Sill&#x27;s line, and by</p>
<p>Hescock&#x27;s and Houghtaling&#x27;s batteries, which had an oblique fire on</p>
<p>the field from a commanding position in rear of my centre.  The</p>
<p>effect of this fire on the advancing column was terrible, but it</p>
<p>continued on till it reached the edge of the timber where Sill&#x27;s</p>
<p>right lay, when my infantry opened at a range of not over fifty</p>
<p>yards.  For a short time the Confederates withstood the fire, but</p>
<p>then wavered, broke, and fell back toward their original line.  As</p>
<p>they retired, Sill&#x27;s brigade followed in a spirited charge, driving</p>
<p>them back across the open ground and behind their intrenchments.  In</p>
<p>this charge the gallant Sill was killed; a rifle ball passing through</p>
<p>his upper lip and penetrating the brain.  Although this was a heavy</p>
<p>loss, yet the enemy&#x27;s discomfiture was such as to give us an hour&#x27;s</p>
<p>time, and as Colonel Greusel, Thirty-sixth Illinois, succeeded to</p>
<p>Sill&#x27;s command, I directed him, as he took charge, to recall the</p>
<p>brigade to its original position, for the turning-column on my</p>
<p>extreme right was now assuming the most menacing attitude, and it was</p>
<p>urgently necessary to prepare for it.</p>
<p>When that portion of the enemy driven back by Sill recovered from its</p>
<p>repulse it again advanced to the attack, this time directing its</p>
<p>efforts chiefly upon my extreme right, and the front of Woodruff&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade of Davis&#x27;s division, which brigade still held on in its first</p>
<p>position.  In front of my centre the Confederates were again driven</p>
<p>back, but as the assault on Woodruff was in conjunction with an</p>
<p>advance of the column that had forced Johnson to retire, Woodruff was</p>
<p>compelled unfortunately to give way, and two regiments on the right</p>
<p>of my line went with him, till they rallied on the two reserve</p>
<p>regiments which, in anticipation of the enemy&#x27;s initiatory attack I</p>
<p>had sent to Sill&#x27;s rear before daylight.</p>
<p>Both Johnson&#x27;s and Davis&#x27;s divisions were now practically gone from</p>
<p>our line, having retired with a loss of all formation, and they were</p>
<p>being closely pursued by the enemy, whose columns were following the</p>
<p>arc of a circle that would ultimately carry him in on my rear.  In</p>
<p>consequence of the fact that this state of things would soon subject</p>
<p>me to a fire in reverse, I hastily withdrew Sill&#x27;s brigade and the</p>
<p>reserve regiments supporting it, and ordered Roberts&#x27;s brigade, which</p>
<p>at the close of the enemy&#x27;s second repulse had changed front toward</p>
<p>the south and formed in column of regiments, to cover the withdrawal</p>
<p>by a charge on the Confederates as they came into the timber where my</p>
<p>right had originally rested.  Roberts made the charge at the proper</p>
<p>time, and was successful in checking the enemy&#x27;s advance, thus giving</p>
<p>us a breathing-spell, during which I was able to take up a new</p>
<p>position with Schaefer&#x27;s and Sill&#x27;s brigades on the commanding ground</p>
<p>to the rear, where Hescock&#x27;s and Houghtaling&#x27;s batteries had been</p>
<p>posted all the morning.</p>
<p>The general course of this new position was at right angles with my</p>
<p>original line, and it took the shape of an obtuse angle, with my</p>
<p>three batteries at the apex.  Davis, and Carlin of his division,</p>
<p>endeavored to rally their men here on my right, but their efforts</p>
<p>were practically unavailing,--though the calm and cool appearance of</p>
<p>Carlin, who at the time was smoking a stumpy pipe, had some effect,</p>
<p>and was in strong contrast to the excited manner of Davis, who seemed</p>
<p>overpowered by the disaster that had befallen his command.  But few</p>
<p>could be rallied, however, as the men were badly demoralized, and</p>
<p>most of them fell back beyond the Wilkinson pike, where they</p>
<p>reorganized behind the troops of General Thomas.</p>
<p>At this juncture the enemy&#x27;s turning-column began advancing again in</p>
<p>concert with Cheatham&#x27;s division, and as the extreme left of the</p>
<p>Confederates was directed on Griscom&#x27;s house, and their right on the</p>
<p>Blanton house, my new position was in danger of envelopment.  No hope</p>
<p>of stemming the tide at this point seemed probable, but to gain time</p>
<p>I retained my ground as long as possible, and until, under directions</p>
<p>from General McCook, I moved to the front from my left flank and</p>
<p>attached myself to the right of Negley&#x27;s division, which up to this</p>
<p>hour had been left almost undisturbed by the enemy in the line it had</p>
<p>taken up the night before.  Under a heavy fire we succeeded in this</p>
<p>manoeuvre, Schaefer&#x27;s brigade marching first, then the batteries, and</p>
<p>Roberts&#x27;s and Sill&#x27;s brigades following.  When my division arrived on</p>
<p>this new ground, I posted Roberts on Negley&#x27;s right, with Hescock&#x27;s</p>
<p>and Bush&#x27;s guns, the brigade and guns occupying a low rocky ridge of</p>
<p>limestone, which faced them toward Murfreesboro&#x27;, nearly south.  The</p>
<p>rest of my division was aligned facing west, along the edge of a</p>
<p>cedar thicket, the rear rank backed up on the right flank of Roberts,</p>
<p>with Houghtaling&#x27;s battery in the angle.  This presented Sill&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Schaefer&#x27;s brigades in an almost opposite direction to the line we</p>
<p>had so confidently taken up the night before, and covered Negley&#x27;s</p>
<p>rear.  The enemy, in the meantime, had continued his wheeling</p>
<p>movement till he occupied the ground that my batteries and reserve</p>
<p>brigade had held in the morning, and I had now so changed my position</p>
<p>that the left brigade of my division approached his intrenchments in</p>
<p>front of Stone River, while Sill&#x27;s and Schaeffer&#x27;s brigades, by</p>
<p>facing nearly west, confronted the successful troops that had smashed</p>
<p>in our extreme right.</p>
<p>I had hardly got straightened out in this last place when I was</p>
<p>attacked by Cheatham&#x27;s&#x27;division, which, notwithstanding the</p>
<p>staggering blows it had previously received from Sill and Roberts,</p>
<p>now again moved forward in conjunction with the wheeling movement</p>
<p>under the immediate command of Hardee.  One of the most sanguinary</p>
<p>contests of the day now took place.  In fulfillment of Bragg&#x27;s</p>
<p>original design no doubt, Cheatham&#x27;s division attacked on my left,</p>
<p>while heavy masses under Hardee, covered by batteries posted on the</p>
<p>high ground formerly occupied by my guns, assaulted my right, the</p>
<p>whole force advancing simultaneously.  At the same time the enemy</p>
<p>opened an artillery fire from his intrenchments in front of</p>
<p>Murfreesboro&#x27;, and it seemed that he was present on every side.  My</p>
<p>position was strong, however, located in the edge of a dense cedar</p>
<p>thicket and commanding a slight depression of open ground that lay in</p>
<p>my front.  My men were in good spirits too, notwithstanding they had</p>
<p>been a good deal hustled around since daylight, with losses that had</p>
<p>told considerably on their numbers.  Only a short distance now</p>
<p>separated the contending lines, and as the batteries on each side</p>
<p>were not much more than two hundred yards apart when the enemy made</p>
<p>his assault, the artillery fire was fearful in its effect on the</p>
<p>ranks of both contestants, the enemy&#x27;s heavy masses staggering under</p>
<p>the torrent of shell and canister from our batteries, while our lines</p>
<p>were thinned by his ricochetting projectiles, that rebounded again</p>
<p>and again over the thinly covered limestone formation and sped on to</p>
<p>the rear of Negley.  But all his efforts to dislodge or destroy us</p>
<p>were futile, and for the first time since daylight General Hardee was</p>
<p>seriously checked in the turning movement he had begun for the</p>
<p>purpose of getting possession of the Nashville pike, and though</p>
<p>reinforced until two-fifths of Bragg&#x27;s army was now at his command,</p>
<p>yet he met with repulse after repulse, which created great gaps in</p>
<p>his lines and taught him that to overwhelm us was hopeless.</p>
<p>As the enemy was recoiling from his first attack, I received a</p>
<p>message from Rosecrans telling me that he was making new</p>
<p>dispositions, and directing me to hold on where I was until they were</p>
<p>completed.  From this I judged that the existing conditions of the</p>
<p>battle would probably require a sacrifice of my command, so I</p>
<p>informed Roberts and Schaefer that we must be prepared to meet the</p>
<p>demand on us by withstanding the assault of the enemy, no matter what</p>
<p>the outcome.  Every energy was therefore bent to the simple holding</p>
<p>of our ground, and as ammunition was getting scarce, instructions</p>
<p>were given throughout the command to have it reserve its fire till</p>
<p>the most effective moment.  In a little while came a second and a</p>
<p>third assault, and although they were as daring and furious as the</p>
<p>first, yet in each case the Confederates were repulsed, driven back</p>
<p>in confusion, but not without deadly loss to us, for the noble</p>
<p>Roberts was killed, and Colonel Harrington, of the Twenty-Seventh</p>
<p>Illinois, who succeeded to his brigade, was mortally wounded a few</p>
<p>minutes later.  I had now on the death-roll three brigade commanders,</p>
<p>and the loss of subordinate officers and men was appalling, but their</p>
<p>sacrifice had accomplished the desired result; they had not fallen in</p>
<p>vain.  Indeed, the bravery and tenacity of my division gave to</p>
<p>Rosecrans the time required to make new dispositions, and exacted</p>
<p>from our foes the highest commendations.</p>
<p>A lull followed the third fierce assault, and an investigation showed</p>
<p>that, with the exception of a few rounds in my brigade, our</p>
<p>ammunition was entirely exhausted; and while it was apparent that the</p>
<p>enemy was reluctant to renew the conflict in my front, yet I was</p>
<p>satisfied I could not hold on much longer without the danger of</p>
<p>ultimate capture, so I prepared to withdraw as soon as the troops of</p>
<p>Rousseau&#x27;s division, which had been ordered to take up a line on my</p>
<p>right, came into position.  Schaefer&#x27;s and Sill&#x27;s brigades being</p>
<p>without a cartridge, I directed them to fix bayonets for a charge,</p>
<p>and await any attempt of the enemy to embarrass my retreat, while</p>
<p>Roberts&#x27;s brigade, offering such resistance as its small quantity of</p>
<p>ammunition would permit, was pulled slowly in toward the Nashville</p>
<p>pike.  Eighty of the horses of Houghtaling&#x27;s battery having been</p>
<p>killed, an attempt was made to bring his guns back by hand over the</p>
<p>rocky ground, but it could not be done, and we had to abandon them.</p>
<p>Hescock also had lost most of his horses, but all his guns were</p>
<p>saved.  Bush&#x27;s battery lost two pieces, the tangled underbrush in the</p>
<p>dense cedars proving an obstacle to getting them away which his</p>
<p>almost superhuman exertions could not surmount.  Thus far the bloody</p>
<p>duel had cost me heavily, one-third of my division being killed or</p>
<p>wounded.  I had already three brigade commanders killed; a little</p>
<p>later I lost my fourth--Colonel Schaefer.</p>
<p>The difficulties of withdrawing were very great, as the ground was</p>
<p>exceptionally rocky, and the growth of cedars almost impenetrable for</p>
<p>wheeled carriages.  Retiring sullenly under a heavy fire, while the</p>
<p>general line was reformed to my right and rear, my division was at</p>
<p>length drawn through the cedars and debouched into an open space near</p>
<p>the Murfreesboro&#x27; pike, behind the right of Palmer&#x27;s division.  Two</p>
<p>regiments of Sill&#x27;s brigade, however, on account of the conformation</p>
<p>of the ground, were obliged to fall back from the point where</p>
<p>Woodruff&#x27;s brigade of Davis&#x27;s division had rallied after the disaster</p>
<p>of the early morning.  The division came out of the cedars with</p>
<p>unbroken ranks, thinned by only its killed and wounded--but few</p>
<p>missing.  When we came into the open ground, McCook directed</p>
<p>Roberts&#x27;s brigade--now commanded by Colonel Luther P. Bradley--to</p>
<p>proceed a short distance to the rear on the Nashville pike, to repel</p>
<p>the enemy&#x27;s threatening attempt at our communications.  Willingly and</p>
<p>cheerfully the brigade again entered the fight under these new</p>
<p>conditions, and although it was supplied with but three or four</p>
<p>cartridges to the man now, it charged gallantly and recaptured two</p>
<p>pieces of artillery which the Union troops had had to abandon at that</p>
<p>point.</p>
<p>Shortly after we debouched from the cedars I was directed by</p>
<p>Rosecrans to send some aid to the right of General Palmer&#x27;s division;</p>
<p>and two of Schaefer&#x27;s regiments, having obtained ammunition, were</p>
<p>pushed up on Palmer&#x27;s right, accompanied by four of Hescock&#x27;s guns;</p>
<p>but the advance of the enemy here had already been checked by Palmer,</p>
<p>and only a desultory contest ensued.  Rosecrans, whom I now met in</p>
<p>the open ground west of the railroad, behind Palmer, directed that my</p>
<p>command should relieve Wood&#x27;s division, which was required to fall</p>
<p>back and take up the new line that had been marked out while I was</p>
<p>holding on in the cedars.  His usually florid face had lost its ruddy</p>
<p>color, and his anxious eyes told that the disasters of the morning</p>
<p>were testing his powers to the very verge of endurance, but he seemed</p>
<p>fully to comprehend what had befallen us.  His firmly set lips and,</p>
<p>the calmness with which his instructions were delivered inspired</p>
<p>confidence in all around him; and expressing approbation of what my</p>
<p>division had done, while deliberately directing it to a new point, he</p>
<p>renewed in us all the hope of final victory, though it must be</p>
<p>admitted that at this phase of the battle the chances lay largely</p>
<p>with the enemy.</p>
<p>Withdrawing the two regiments and Hescock&#x27;s battery, that I had</p>
<p>posted on the right of Palmer, I moved as directed by Rosecrans into</p>
<p>the position to the east of the railroad, and formed immediately to</p>
<p>the right of Wood, who was now being attacked all along his front,</p>
<p>but more particularly where his right rested near the railroad.</p>
<p>Under a storm of shot and shell that came in torrents my troops took</p>
<p>up the new ground, advancing through a clump of open timber to Wood&#x27;s</p>
<p>assistance.  Forming in line in front of the timber we poured a</p>
<p>telling fire into the enemy&#x27;s ranks, which were then attacking across</p>
<p>some cleared fields; but when he discovered additional troops</p>
<p>confronting him, he gave up the attempt to carry Wood&#x27;s position.  It</p>
<p>was here that I lost Schaefer, who was killed instantly, making my</p>
<p>fourth brigade commander dead that day.  The enemy in front of Wood</p>
<p>having been checked, our whole line east of the railroad executed</p>
<p>undisturbed its retrograde movement to a position about three hundred</p>
<p>yards to its rear.  When I fell back to the edge of the clump of</p>
<p>timber, where when first coming on the ground I had formed to help</p>
<p>Wood, I was ordered by Rosecrans to prepare to make a charge should</p>
<p>the enemy again assault us.  In anticipation of this work I massed my</p>
<p>troops in close column.  The expected attack never came, however, but</p>
<p>the shot and shell of a furious cannonade told with fatal effect upon</p>
<p>men and officers as they lay on their faces hugging the ground.  The</p>
<p>torments of this trying situation were almost unbearable, but it was</p>
<p>obvious to all that it was necessary to have at hand a compact body</p>
<p>of troops to repel any assault the enemy might make pending the</p>
<p>reconstruction of the extreme right of our line, and a silent</p>
<p>determination to stay seemed to take hold of each individual soldier;</p>
<p>nor was this grim silence interrupted throughout the cannonade,</p>
<p>except in one instance, when one of the regiments broke out in a</p>
<p>lusty cheer as a startled rabbit in search of a new hiding-place</p>
<p>safely ran the whole length of the line on the backs of the men.</p>
<p>While my troops were still lying here, General Rosecrans, with a part</p>
<p>of his staff and a few orderlies, rode out on the rearranged line to</p>
<p>supervise its formation and encourage the men, and in prosecution of</p>
<p>these objects moved around the front of my column of attack, within</p>
<p>range of the batteries that were shelling us so viciously.  As he</p>
<p>passed to the open ground on my left, I joined him.  The enemy seeing</p>
<p>this mounted party, turned his guns upon it, and his accurate aim was</p>
<p>soon rewarded, for a solid shot carried away the head of Colonel</p>
<p>Garesche, the chief-of-staff, and killed or wounded two or three</p>
<p>orderlies.  Garesche&#x27;s appalling death stunned us all, and a</p>
<p>momentary expression of horror spread over Rosecrans&#x27;s face; but at</p>
<p>such a time the importance of self-control was vital, and he pursued</p>
<p>his course with an appearance of indifference, which, however, those</p>
<p>immediately about him saw was assumed, for undoubtedly he felt most</p>
<p>deeply the death of his friend and trusted staff-officer.</p>
<p>No other attacks were made on us to the east of the railroad for the</p>
<p>rest of the afternoon, and just before dark I was directed to</p>
<p>withdraw and take up a position along the west side of the Nashville</p>
<p>pike, on the extreme right of our new line, where Roberts&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>and the Seventy-third and Eighty-eighth Illinois had already been</p>
<p>placed by McCook.  The day had cost me much anxiety and sadness, and</p>
<p>I was sorely disappointed at the general result, though I could not</p>
<p>be other than pleased at the part taken by my command.  The loss of</p>
<p>my brigade commanders--Sill, Roberts, Schaefer, and Harrington-and a</p>
<p>large number of regimental and battery officers, with so many of</p>
<p>their men, struck deep into my heart: My thinned ranks told the</p>
<p>woeful tale of the fierce struggles, indescribable by words, through</p>
<p>which my division had passed since 7 o&#x27;clock in the morning; and</p>
<p>this, added to our hungry and exhausted condition, was naturally</p>
<p>disheartening.  The men had been made veterans, however, by the</p>
<p>fortunes and misfortunes of the day, and as they went into their new</p>
<p>places still confident of final success, it was plain to see that</p>
<p>they felt a self-confidence inspired by the part they had already</p>
<p>played.</p>
<p>My headquarters were now established on the Nashville pike, about</p>
<p>three miles and a half from Murfreesboro&#x27;; my division being aligned</p>
<p>to the west of the pike, bowed out and facing almost west, Cleburn&#x27;s</p>
<p>division of the Confederates confronting it.  Davis&#x27;s division was</p>
<p>posted on my right, and Walker&#x27;s brigade of Thomas&#x27;s corps, which had</p>
<p>reported to me, took up a line that con nected my left with Johnson&#x27;s</p>
<p>division.</p>
<p>Late in the evening General Rosecrans, accompanied by General McCook,</p>
<p>and several other officers whose names I am now unable to recall,</p>
<p>rode by my headquarters on their way to the rear to look for a new</p>
<p>line of battle--on Overall&#x27;s creek it was said--that would preserve</p>
<p>our communications with Nashville and offer better facilities for</p>
<p>resistance than the one we were now holding.  Considerable time had</p>
<p>elapsed when they returned from this exploration and proceeded to</p>
<p>their respective commands, without intimating to me that anything had</p>
<p>been determined upon by the reconnoissance, but a little later it was</p>
<p>rumored through the different headquarters that while the party was</p>
<p>looking for a new position it discovered the enemy&#x27;s troops moving</p>
<p>toward our right and rear, the head of his columns being conducted in</p>
<p>the darkness by the aid of torches, and that no alternative was left</p>
<p>us but to hold the lines we then occupied.  The torches had been seen</p>
<p>unquestionably, and possibly created some alarm at first in the minds</p>
<p>of the reconnoitring party, but it was soon ascertained that the</p>
<p>lights came from a battalion of the Fourth regular cavalry that was</p>
<p>picketing our flank and happened to be starting its bivouac fires at</p>
<p>the moment.  The fires and the supposed movements had no weight,</p>
<p>therefore, in deciding the proposition to take up a line at Overall&#x27;s</p>
<p>creek, but General Rosecrans, fortunately for the army, decided to</p>
<p>remain where he was.  Doubtless reflections during his ride caused</p>
<p>him to realize that the enemy must be quite as much crippled as</p>
<p>himself.  If it had been decided to fall back to Overall&#x27;s creek, we</p>
<p>could have withdrawn without much difficulty very likely, but such a</p>
<p>retrograde movement would have left to the enemy the entire battle-</p>
<p>field of Stone River and ultimately compelled our retreat to</p>
<p>Nashville.</p>
<p>In the night of December 3rd several slight demonstrations were made</p>
<p>on my front, but from the darkness neither party felt the effect of</p>
<p>the other&#x27;s fire, and when daylight came again the skirmishers and</p>
<p>lines of battle were in about the same position they had taken up the</p>
<p>evening before.  Soon after daybreak it became evident that the</p>
<p>conflict was to be renewed, and a little later the enemy resumed the</p>
<p>offensive by an attack along my left front, especially on Walker&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade.  His attempt was ineffectual, however, and so easily</p>
<p>repulsed as to demonstrate that the desperate character of his</p>
<p>assaults the day before had nearly exhausted his strength.  About 3</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock in the afternoon he made another feeble charge on my front,</p>
<p>but our fire from the barricades and rifle-pits soon demoralized his</p>
<p>advancing lines, which fell back in some confusion, thus enabling us</p>
<p>to pick up about a hundred prisoners.  From this time till the</p>
<p>evening of January 3 Bragg&#x27;s left remained in our front, and</p>
<p>continued to show itself at intervals by weak demonstrations, which</p>
<p>we afterward ascertained were directly intended to cover the</p>
<p>desperate assault he made with Breckenridge on the left of Rosecrans,</p>
<p>an assault that really had in view only a defensive purpose, for</p>
<p>unless Bragg dislodged the troops which were now massing in front of</p>
<p>his right he would be obliged to withdraw General Polk&#x27;s corps behind</p>
<p>Stone River and finally abandon Murfreesboro&#x27;.  The sequel proved</p>
<p>this to be the case; and the ill-judged assault led by Breckenridge</p>
<p>ending in entire defeat, Bragg retired from Murfreesboro&#x27; the night</p>
<p>of January 3.</p>
<p>General Rosecrans occupied Murfreesboro&#x27; on the 4th and 5th, having</p>
<p>gained a costly victory, which was not decisive enough in its</p>
<p>character to greatly affect the general course of the war, though it</p>
<p>somewhat strengthened and increased our hold on Middle Tennessee.</p>
<p>The enemy in retiring did not fall back very far--only behind Duck</p>
<p>River to Shelbyville and Tullahoma--and but little endeavor was made</p>
<p>to follow him.  Indeed, we were not in condition to pursue, even if</p>
<p>it had been the intention at the outset of the campaign.</p>
<p>As soon as possible after the Confederate retreat I went over the</p>
<p>battle-field to collect such of my wounded as had not been carried</p>
<p>off to the South and to bury my dead.  In the cedars and on the</p>
<p>ground where I had been so fiercely assaulted when the battle opened,</p>
<p>on the morning of the 31st, evidences of the bloody struggle appeared</p>
<p>on every hand in the form of broken fire-arms, fragments of</p>
<p>accoutrements, and splintered trees.  The dead had nearly all been</p>
<p>left unburied, but as there was likelihood of their mutilation by</p>
<p>roving swine, the bodies had mostly been collected in piles at</p>
<p>different points and inclosed by rail fences.  The sad duties of</p>
<p>interment and of caring for the wounded were completed by the 5th,</p>
<p>and on the 6th I moved my division three miles, south of</p>
<p>Murfreesboro&#x27; on the Shelbyville pike, going into camp on the banks</p>
<p>of Stone River.  Here the condition of my command was thoroughly</p>
<p>looked into, and an endeavor made to correct such defects as had been</p>
<p>disclosed by the recent battle.</p>
<p>During the engagement there had been little straggling, and my list</p>
<p>of missing was small and legitimate; still, it was known that a very</p>
<p>few had shirked their duty, and an example was necessary.  Among this</p>
<p>small number were four officers who, it was charged, had abandoned</p>
<p>their colors and regiments.  When their guilt was clearly</p>
<p>established, and as soon as an opportunity occurred, I caused the</p>
<p>whole division to be formed in a hollow square, closed in mass, and</p>
<p>had the four officers marched to the centre, where, telling them that</p>
<p>I would not humiliate any officer or soldier by requiring him to</p>
<p>touch their disgraced swords, I compelled them to deliver theirs up</p>
<p>to my colored servant, who also cut from their coats every insignia</p>
<p>of rank.  Then, after there had been read to the command an order</p>
<p>from army headquarters dismissing the four from the service, the</p>
<p>scene was brought to a close by drumming the cowards out of camp.  It</p>
<p>was a mortifying spectacle, but from that day no officer in that</p>
<p>division ever abandoned his colors.</p>
<p>My effective force in the battle of Stone River was 4,154 officers</p>
<p>and men.  Of this number I lost 1,633 killed, wounded, and missing,</p>
<p>or nearly 40 per cent.  In the remaining years of the war, though</p>
<p>often engaged in most severe contests, I never experienced in any of</p>
<p>my commands so high a rate of casualties.  The ratio of loss in the</p>
<p>whole of Rosecrans&#x27;s army was also high, and Bragg&#x27;s losses were</p>
<p>almost equally great.  Rosecrans carried into the action about 42,000</p>
<p>officers and men.  He lost 13,230, or 31 per cent.  Bragg&#x27;s effective</p>
<p>force was 37,800 officers and men; he lost 10,306, or nearly 28 per</p>
<p>cent.</p>
<p>Though our victory was dearly bought, yet the importance of gaining</p>
<p>the day at any price was very great, particularly when we consider</p>
<p>what might have been the result had not the gallantry of the army and</p>
<p>the manoeuvring during the early disaster saved us from ultimate</p>
<p>defeat.  We had started out from Nashville on an offensive campaign,</p>
<p>probably with no intention of going beyond Murfreesboro&#x27;, in</p>
<p>midwinter, but still with the expectation of delivering a crushing</p>
<p>blow should the enemy accept our challenge to battle.  He met us with</p>
<p>a plan of attack almost the counterpart of our own.  In the execution</p>
<p>of his plan he had many advantages, not the least of which was his</p>
<p>intimate knowledge of the ground, and he came near destroying us.</p>
<p>Had he done so, Nashville would probably have fallen; at all events,</p>
<p>Kentucky would have been opened again to his incursions, and the</p>
<p>theatre of war very likely transferred once more to the Ohio River.</p>
<p>As the case now stood, however, Nashville was firmly established as a</p>
<p>base for future operations, Kentucky was safe from the possibility of</p>
<p>being again overrun, and Bragg, thrown on the defensive, was</p>
<p>compelled to give his thoughts to the protection of the interior of</p>
<p>the Confederacy and the security of Chattanooga, rather than indulge</p>
<p>in schemes of conquest north of the Cumberland River.  While he still</p>
<p>held on in Middle Tennessee his grasp was so much loosened that only</p>
<p>slight effort would be necessary to push him back into Georgia, and</p>
<p>thus give to the mountain region of East Tennessee an opportunity to</p>
<p>prove its loyalty to the, Union.</p>
<p>The victory quieted the fears of the West and Northwest, destroyed</p>
<p>the hopes of the secession element in Kentucky, renewed the drooping</p>
<p>spirits of the East Tennesseans, and demoralized the disunionists in</p>
<p>Middle Tennessee; yet it was a negative victory so far as concerned</p>
<p>the result on the battle-field.  Rosecrans seems to have planned the</p>
<p>battle with the idea that the enemy would continue passive, remain</p>
<p>entirely on the defensive, and that it was necessary only to push</p>
<p>forward our left in order to force the evacuation of Murfreesboro&#x27;;</p>
<p>and notwithstanding the fact that on the afternoon of December 30</p>
<p>McCook received information that the right of Johnson&#x27;s division.</p>
<p>resting near the Franklin pike, extended only to about the centre of</p>
<p>the Confederate army, it does not appear that attack from that</p>
<p>quarter was at all apprehended by the Union commanders.</p>
<p>The natural line of retreat of the Confederates was not threatened by</p>
<p>the design of Rosecrans; and Bragg, without risk to his</p>
<p>communications, anticipated it by a counter-attack of like character</p>
<p>from his own left, and demolished his adversary&#x27;s plan the moment we</p>
<p>were thrown on the defensive.  Had Bragg followed up with the spirit</p>
<p>which characterized its beginning the successful attack by Hardee on</p>
<p>our right wing--and there seems no reason why he should not have done</p>
<p>so--the army of Rosecrans still might have got back to Nashville, but</p>
<p>it would have been depleted and demoralized to such a degree as to</p>
<p>unfit it for offensive operations for a long time afterward.  Bragg&#x27;s</p>
<p>intrenchments in front of Stone River were very strong, and there</p>
<p>seems no reason why he should not have used his plain advantage as</p>
<p>explained, but instead he allowed us to gain time, intrench, and</p>
<p>recover a confidence that at first was badly shaken.  Finally, to cap</p>
<p>the climax of his errors, he directed Breckenridge to make the</p>
<p>assault from his right flank on January 2, with small chance for</p>
<p>anything but disaster, when the real purpose in view could have been</p>
<p>accomplished without the necessity of any offensive manoeuvre</p>
<p>whatever.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<p>APPOINTED A MAJOR-GENERAL--THE SECRET EXPEDITION UNDER CARD THE</p>
<p>SCOUT--HIS CAPTURE BY GUERRILLAS--ESCAPE--A REVENGE PARTY--WOMEN</p>
<p>SOLDIERS--A FIGHT WITH SABRES--TULLAHOMA CAMPAIGN--A FOOLISH</p>
<p>ADVENTURE.</p>
<p>On the 6th of January, 1863, my division settled quietly down in its</p>
<p>camp south of Murfreesboro&#x27;.  Its exhausted condition after the</p>
<p>terrible experiences of the preceding week required attention.  It</p>
<p>needed recuperation, reinforcement, and reorganization, and I set</p>
<p>about these matters without delay, in anticipation of active</p>
<p>operations early in the spring.  No forward movement was made for</p>
<p>nearly six months, however, and throughout this period drills,</p>
<p>parades, reconnoissances, and foraging expeditions filled in the time</p>
<p>profitably.  In addition to these exercises the construction of</p>
<p>permanent fortifications for the security of Murfreesboro&#x27; was</p>
<p>undertaken by General Rosecrans, and large details from my troops</p>
<p>were furnished daily for the work.  Much attention was also given to</p>
<p>creating a more perfect system of guard and picket duty-a matter that</p>
<p>had hitherto been somewhat neglected in the army, as its constant</p>
<p>activity had permitted scant opportunity for the development of such</p>
<p>a system.  It was at this time that I received my appointment as a</p>
<p>major-general of Volunteers.  My promotion had been recommended by</p>
<p>General Rosecrans immediately after the battle of Stone River, but</p>
<p>for some reason it was delayed until April, and though a long time</p>
<p>elapsed between the promise and the performance, my gratification was</p>
<p>extreme.</p>
<p>My scout, Card, was exceedingly useful while encamped near</p>
<p>Murfreesboro, making several trips to East Tennessee within the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s lines to collect information as to the condition of the loyal</p>
<p>people there, and to encourage them with the hope of early</p>
<p>liberation.  He also brought back from each trip very accurate</p>
<p>statements as to the strength and doings of the Confederate army,</p>
<p>fixing almost with certainty its numbers and the locations of its</p>
<p>different divisions, and enabling my engineer-officer--Major</p>
<p>Morhardt--to construct good maps of the country in our front.  On</p>
<p>these dangerous excursions Card was always accompanied by one of his</p>
<p>brothers, the other remaining with me to be ready for duty if any</p>
<p>accident occurred to those who had gone out, or in case I wanted to</p>
<p>communicate with them.  In this way we kept well posted, although the</p>
<p>intelligence these men brought was almost always secured at the risk</p>
<p>of their lives.</p>
<p>Early in the spring, before the Tullahoma campaign began, I thought</p>
<p>it would be practicable, by sending out a small secret expedition of</p>
<p>but three or four men, to break the Nashville and Chattanooga</p>
<p>railroad between Chattanooga and the enemy&#x27;s position at Tullahoma by</p>
<p>burning the bridges in Crow Creek valley from its head to Stevenson,</p>
<p>Alabama, and then the great bridge across the Tennessee River at</p>
<p>Bridgeport.  Feeling confident that I could persuade Card to</p>
<p>undertake the perilous duty, I broached the contemplated project to</p>
<p>him, and he at once jumped at the opportunity of thus distinguishing</p>
<p>himself, saying that with one of his brothers and three other loyal</p>
<p>East Tennesseeans, whose services he knew could be enlisted, he felt</p>
<p>sure of carrying out the idea, so I gave him authority to choose his</p>
<p>own assistants.  In a few days his men appeared at my headquarters,</p>
<p>and when supplied with money in notes of the State Bank of Tennessee,</p>
<p>current everywhere as gold in those days, the party, composed of</p>
<p>Card, the second brother, and the three East Tennesseeans, started on</p>
<p>their precarious enterprise, their course being directed first toward</p>
<p>the Cumberland Mountains, intending to strike the Nashville and</p>
<p>Chattanooga railroad somewhere above Anderson&#x27;s station.  They</p>
<p>expected to get back in about fifteen days, but I looked for some</p>
<p>knowledge of the progress of their adventure before the expiration of</p>
<p>that period, hoping to hear through Confederate sources prisoners and</p>
<p>the like-of the destruction of the bridges.  I waited in patience for</p>
<p>such news, but none came, and as the time Card had allotted himself</p>
<p>passed by, I watched anxiously for his return, for, as there was</p>
<p>scarcely a doubt that the expedition had proved a failure, the fate</p>
<p>of the party became a matter of deep concern to Card&#x27;s remaining</p>
<p>brother and to me.  Finally this brother volunteered to go to his</p>
<p>father&#x27;s house in East Tennessee to get tidings of the party, and I</p>
<p>consented, for the probabilities were that some of them had made</p>
<p>their way to that point, or at least that some information had</p>
<p>reached there about them.  As day after day went by, the time fixed</p>
<p>for this brother&#x27;s return came round, yet he also remained out; but</p>
<p>some days after the lad was due Card himself turned up accompanied by</p>
<p>the brother he had taken with him, soon explained his delay in</p>
<p>getting back, and gave me the story of his adventures while absent.</p>
<p>After leaving my camp, his party had followed various byways across</p>
<p>the Cumberland Mountains to Crow Creek Valley, as instructed; but</p>
<p>when nearing the railroad above Anderson&#x27;s Station, they were</p>
<p>captured by some guerrillas prowling about that vicinity, and being</p>
<p>suspected of disloyalty to the Confederacy, were carried to</p>
<p>Chattanooga and imprisoned as Yankee spies.  Their prospects now were</p>
<p>decidedly discouraging, for death stared them in the face.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, some delays occurred relative to the</p>
<p>disposition that should be made of them, and they, meanwhile,</p>
<p>effected their escape from their jailors by way of one of the prison</p>
<p>windows, from which they managed to displace a bar, and by a skiff,</p>
<p>in the darkness of night, crossed the Tennessee River a little below</p>
<p>Chattanooga.  From this point the party made their way back to my</p>
<p>camp, traveling only at night, hiding in the woods by day, and for</p>
<p>food depending on loyal citizens that Card had become acquainted with</p>
<p>when preaching and pedling.</p>
<p>Card&#x27;s first inquiry after relating his story was for the youngest</p>
<p>brother, whom he had left with me.  I told him what I had done, in my</p>
<p>anxiety about himself, and that more than sufficient time had elapsed</p>
<p>for his brother&#x27;s return.  His reply was: &quot;They have caught him.  The</p>
<p>poor fellow is dead.&quot;  His surmise proved correct; for news soon came</p>
<p>that the poor boy had been captured at his father&#x27;s house, and</p>
<p>hanged.  The blow to Card was a severe one, and so hardened his heart</p>
<p>against the guerrillas in the neighborhood of his father&#x27;s home--for</p>
<p>he knew they were guilty of his brother&#x27;s murder--that it was with</p>
<p>difficulty I could persuade him to continue in the employment of the</p>
<p>Government, so determined was he to avenge his brother&#x27;s death at the</p>
<p>first opportunity.  Finally, however, I succeeded in quieting the</p>
<p>almost uncontrollable rage that seemed to possess him, and he</p>
<p>remained with me during the Tullahoma and Chickamauga campaigns; but</p>
<p>when we reached Knoxville the next winter, he took his departure,</p>
<p>informing me that he was going for the bushwhackers who had killed</p>
<p>his brother.  A short time after he left me, I saw him at the head of</p>
<p>about thirty well-armed East Tennesseeans--refugees.  They were</p>
<p>determined-looking men, seeking revenge for the wrongs and sufferings</p>
<p>that had been put upon them in the last two years, and no doubt</p>
<p>wreaked their vengeance right and left on all who had been in any way</p>
<p>instrumental in persecuting them.</p>
<p>The feeding of our army from the base at Louisville was attended with</p>
<p>a great many difficulties, as the enemy&#x27;s cavalry was constantly</p>
<p>breaking the railroad and intercepting our communications on the</p>
<p>Cumberland River at different points that were easily accessible to</p>
<p>his then superior force of troopers.  The accumulation of reserve</p>
<p>stores was therefore not an easy task, and to get forage ahead a few</p>
<p>days was well-nigh impossible, unless that brought from the North was</p>
<p>supplemented by what we could gather from the country.  Corn was</p>
<p>abundant in the region to the south and southwest of Murfreesboro&#x27;,</p>
<p>so to make good our deficiences in this respect, I employed a brigade</p>
<p>about once a week in the duty of collecting and bringing in forage,</p>
<p>sending out sometimes as many as a hundred and fifty wagons to haul</p>
<p>the grain which my scouts had previously located.  In nearly every</p>
<p>one of these expeditions the enemy was encountered, and the wagons</p>
<p>were usually loaded while the skirmishers kept up a running fire,</p>
<p>Often there would occur a respectable brush, with the loss on each</p>
<p>side of a number of killed and wounded.  The officer in direct</p>
<p>command always reported to me personally whatever had happened during</p>
<p>the time he was out--the result of his reconnoissance, so to speak,</p>
<p>for that war the real nature of these excursions--and on one occasion</p>
<p>the colonel in command, Colonel Conrad, of the Fifteenth Missouri,</p>
<p>informed me that he got through without much difficulty; in fact,</p>
<p>that everything had gone all right and been eminently satisfactory,</p>
<p>except that in returning he had been mortified greatly by the conduct</p>
<p>of the two females belonging to the detachment and division train at</p>
<p>my headquarters.  These women, he said, had given much annoyance by</p>
<p>getting drunk, and to some extent demoralizing his men.  To say that</p>
<p>I was astonished at his statement would be a mild way of putting it,</p>
<p>and had I not known him to be a most upright man and of sound sense,</p>
<p>I should have doubted not only his veracity, but his sanity.</p>
<p>Inquiring who they were and for further details, I was informed that</p>
<p>there certainly were in the command two females, that in some</p>
<p>mysterious manner had attached themselves to the service as soldiers;</p>
<p>that one, an East Tennessee woman, was a teamster in the division</p>
<p>wagon-train and the other a private soldier in a cavalry company</p>
<p>temporarily attached to my headquarters for escort duty.  While out</p>
<p>on the foraging expedition these Amazons had secured a supply of</p>
<p>&quot;apple-jack&quot; by some means, got very drunk, and on the return had</p>
<p>fallen into Stone River and been nearly drowned.  After they had been</p>
<p>fished from, the water, in the process of resuscitation their sex was</p>
<p>disclosed, though up to this time it appeared to be known only to</p>
<p>each other.  The story was straight and the circumstance clear, so,</p>
<p>convinced of Conrad&#x27;s continued sanity, I directed the provost-</p>
<p>marshal to bring in arrest to my headquarters the two disturbers of</p>
<p>Conrad&#x27;s peace of mind, After some little search the East Tennessee</p>
<p>woman was found in camp, somewhat the worse for the experiences of</p>
<p>the day before, but awaiting her fate content idly smoking a cob-</p>
<p>pipe.  She was brought to me, and put in duress under charge of the</p>
<p>division surgeon until her companion could be secured.  To the doctor</p>
<p>she related that the year before she had &quot;refugeed&quot; from East</p>
<p>Tennessee, and on arriving in Louisville assumed men&#x27;s apparel and</p>
<p>sought and obtained employment as a teamster in the quartermaster&#x27;s</p>
<p>department.  Her features were very large, and so coarse and</p>
<p>masculine was her general appearance that she would readily have</p>
<p>passed as a man, and in her case the deception was no doubt easily</p>
<p>practiced.  Next day the &quot;she dragoon&quot; was caught, and proved to be a</p>
<p>rather prepossessing young woman, and though necessarily bronzed and</p>
<p>hardened by exposure, I doubt if, even with these marks of</p>
<p>campaigning, she could have deceived as readily as did her companion.</p>
<p>How the two got acquainted, I never learned, and though they had</p>
<p>joined the army independently of each other, yet an intimacy had</p>
<p>sprung up between them long before the mishaps of the foraging</p>
<p>expedition.  They both were forwarded to army headquarters, and, when</p>
<p>provided with clothing suited to their sex, sent back to Nashville,</p>
<p>and thence beyond our lines to Louisville.</p>
<p>On January 9, by an order from the War Department, the Army of the</p>
<p>Cumberland had been divided into three corps, designated the</p>
<p>Fourteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-first.  This order did not alter</p>
<p>the composition of the former grand divisions, nor change the</p>
<p>commanders, but the new nomenclature was a decided improvement over</p>
<p>the clumsy designations Right Wing, Centre, and Left Wing, which were</p>
<p>well calculated to lead to confusion sometimes.  McCook&#x27;s wing became</p>
<p>the Twentieth Corps, and my division continued of the same</p>
<p>organization, and held the same number as formerly-the Third</p>
<p>Division, Twentieth Corps.  My first brigade was now commanded by</p>
<p>Brigadier-General William H. Lytle, the second by Colonel Bernard</p>
<p>Laiboldt, and the third by Colonel Luther P. Bradley.</p>
<p>On the 4th of March I was directed to move in light marching order</p>
<p>toward Franklin and join General Gordon Granger, to take part in some</p>
<p>operations which he was projecting against General Earl Van Dorn,</p>
<p>then at Spring Hill.  Knowing that my line of march would carry me</p>
<p>through a region where forage was plentiful, I took along a large</p>
<p>train of empty wagons, which I determined to fill with corn and send</p>
<p>back to Murfreesboro&#x27;, believing that I could successfully cover the</p>
<p>train by Minty&#x27;s brigade of cavalry, which had joined me for the</p>
<p>purpose of aiding in a reconnoissance toward Shelbyville.  In</p>
<p>marching the column I placed a regiment of infantry at its head, then</p>
<p>the wagon-train, then a brigade of infantry--masking the cavalry</p>
<p>behind this brigade.  The enemy, discovering that the train was with</p>
<p>us, and thinking he could capture it, came boldly out with his,</p>
<p>cavalry to attack.  The head of his column came up to the crossroads</p>
<p>at Versailles, but holding him there, I passed the train and infantry</p>
<p>brigade beyond toward Eagleville, and when my cavalry had been thus</p>
<p>unmasked, Minty, followed by the balance of my division, which vas</p>
<p>still behind, charged him with the sabre.  Success was immediate and</p>
<p>complete, and pursuit of the routed forces continued through</p>
<p>Unionville, until we fell upon and drove in the Confederate outposts</p>
<p>at Shelbyville.  Here the enemy was taken by surprise evidently,</p>
<p>which was most fortunate for us, otherwise the consequences might</p>
<p>have been disastrous.  Minty captured in the charge about fifty</p>
<p>prisoners and a few wagons and mules, and thus enabled me to load my</p>
<p>train with corn, and send it back to Murfreesboro&#x27; unmolested.  In</p>
<p>this little fight the sabre was freely used by both sides, and I do</p>
<p>not believe that during the whole war I again knew of so large a</p>
<p>percentage of wounds by that arm in proportion to the numbers</p>
<p>engaged.</p>
<p>That night I encamped at Eagleville, and next day reported to Granger</p>
<p>at Franklin, arriving in the midst of much excitement prevailing on</p>
<p>account of the loss of Coburn&#x27;s brigade, which had been captured the</p>
<p>day before a little distance south of that point, while marching to</p>
<p>form a junction with a column that had been directed on Columbia from</p>
<p>Murfreesboro&#x27;.  Shortly after Coburn&#x27;s capture General Granger had</p>
<p>come upon the scene, and the next day he advanced my division and</p>
<p>Minty&#x27;s troops directly on Spring Hill, with a view to making some</p>
<p>reprisal; but Van Dorn had no intention of accommodating us, and</p>
<p>retired from Spring Hill, offering but little resistance.  He</p>
<p>continued to fall back, till finally he got behind Duck River, where</p>
<p>operations against him ceased; for, in consequence of the incessant</p>
<p>rains of the season, the streams had become almost impassable.</p>
<p>Later, I returned by way of Franklin to my old camp at Murfreesboro&#x27;,</p>
<p>passing over on this march the ground on which the Confederate</p>
<p>General Hood met with such disaster the following year in his attack</p>
<p>on Stanley&#x27;s corps.</p>
<p>My command had all returned from the Franklin expedition to</p>
<p>Murfreesboro&#x27; and gone into camp on the Salem pike by the latter part</p>
<p>of March, from which time till June it took part in only the little</p>
<p>affairs of outposts occurring every now and then on my own front.  In</p>
<p>the meanwhile General Rosecrans had been materially reinforced by the</p>
<p>return of sick and wounded men; his army had become well disciplined,</p>
<p>and was tolerably supplied; and he was repeatedly pressed by the</p>
<p>authorities at Washington to undertake offensive operations.</p>
<p>During the spring and early summer Rosecrans resisted, with a great</p>
<p>deal of spirit and on various grounds, these frequent urgings, and</p>
<p>out of this grew up an acrimonious correspondence and strained</p>
<p>feeling between him and General Halleck.  Early in June, however,</p>
<p>stores had been accumulated and other preparations made for a move</p>
<p>forward, Resecrans seeming to have decided that he could safely risk</p>
<p>an advance, with the prospect of good results.  Before finally</p>
<p>deciding, he called upon most of his corps and division commanders</p>
<p>for their opinions on certain propositions which he presented, and</p>
<p>most of them still opposed the projected movement, I among the</p>
<p>number, reasoning that while General Grant was operating against</p>
<p>Vicksburg, it was better to hold Bragg in Middle Tennessee than to</p>
<p>push him so far back into Georgia that interior means of</p>
<p>communication would give the Confederate Government the opportunity</p>
<p>of quickly joining a part of his force to that of General Johnson in</p>
<p>Mississippi.</p>
<p>At this stage, and in fact prior to it, Rosecrans seemed to manifest</p>
<p>special confidence in me, often discussing his plans with me</p>
<p>independent of the occasions on which he formally referred them for</p>
<p>my views.  I recollect that on two different occasions about this</p>
<p>time he unfolded his designs to me in this informal way, outlining</p>
<p>generally how he expected ultimately to force Bragg south of the</p>
<p>Tennessee River, and going into the details of the contemplated move</p>
<p>on Tullahoma.  His schemes, to my mind, were not only comprehensive,</p>
<p>but exact, and showed conclusively, what no one doubted then, that</p>
<p>they were original with him.  I found in them very little to</p>
<p>criticise unfavorably, if we were to move at all, and Rosecrans</p>
<p>certainly impressed me that he favored an advance at an early day,</p>
<p>though many of his generals were against it until the operations on</p>
<p>the Mississippi River should culminate in something definite.  There</p>
<p>was much, fully apparent in the circumstances about his headquarters,</p>
<p>leading to the conviction that Rosecrans originated the Tullahoma</p>
<p>campaign, and the record of his prior performances collaterally</p>
<p>sustains the visible evidence then existing.  In my opinion, then,</p>
<p>based on a clear recollection of various occurrences growing out of</p>
<p>our intimacy, he conceived the plan of the Tullahoma campaign and the</p>
<p>one succeeding it; and is therefore entitled to every credit that</p>
<p>attended their execution, no matter what may be claimed for others.</p>
<p>On the 23d of June Bragg was covering his position north of Duck</p>
<p>River with a front extending from McMinnville, where his cavalry</p>
<p>rested, through Wartrace and Shelbyville to Columbia, his depot being</p>
<p>at Tullahoma.  Rosecrans, thinking that Bragg would offer strong</p>
<p>resistance at Shelbyville--which was somewhat protected by a spur of</p>
<p>low mountains or hills, offshoots of the Cumberland Mountains--</p>
<p>decided to turn that place; consequently, he directed the mass of the</p>
<p>Union army on the enemy&#x27;s right flank, about Manchester.</p>
<p>On the 26th of June McCook&#x27;s corps advanced toward Liberty Gap, my</p>
<p>divisions marching on the Shelbyville pike.  I had proceeded but a</p>
<p>few miles when I encountered the enemy&#x27;s pickets, who fell back to</p>
<p>Christiana, about nine miles from Murfreesboro&#x27;.  Here I was assailed</p>
<p>pretty wickedly by the enemy&#x27;s sharpshooters and a section of</p>
<p>artillery, but as I was instructed to do nothing more than cover the</p>
<p>road from Eagleville, over which Brannan&#x27;s division was to approach</p>
<p>Christiana, I made little reply to this severe annoyance, wishing to</p>
<p>conceal the strength of my force.  As soon as the head of Brannan&#x27;s</p>
<p>column arrived I marched across-country to the left, and encamped</p>
<p>that night at the little town of Millersburg, in the vicinity of</p>
<p>Liberty Gap.  I was directed to move from Millersburg, on Hoover&#x27;s</p>
<p>Gap--a pass in the range of hills already referred to, through which</p>
<p>ran the turnpike from Murfreesboro&#x27; to Manchester--but heavy rains</p>
<p>had made the country roads almost impassable, and the last of my</p>
<p>division did not reach Hoover&#x27;s Gap till the morning of June 27,</p>
<p>after its abandonment by the enemy.  Continuing on to Fairfield, the</p>
<p>head of my column met, south of that place, a small force of</p>
<p>Confederate infantry and cavalry, which after a slight skirmish</p>
<p>Laiboldt&#x27;s brigade drove back toward Wartrace.  The next morning I</p>
<p>arrived at Manchester, where I remained quiet for the day.  Early on</p>
<p>the 29th I marched by the Lynchburg road for Tullahoma, where the</p>
<p>enemy was believed to be in force, and came into position about six</p>
<p>miles from the town.</p>
<p>By the 31st the whole army had been concentrated, in spite of many</p>
<p>difficulties, and though, on account of the heavy rains that had</p>
<p>fallen almost incessantly since we left Murfreesboro&#x27;, its movements</p>
<p>had been slow and somewhat inaccurate, yet the precision with which</p>
<p>it took up a line of battle for an attack on Tullahoma showed that</p>
<p>forethought and study had been given to every detail.  The enemy had</p>
<p>determined to fall back from Tullahoma at the beginning of the</p>
<p>campaign, however, and as we advanced, his evacuation had so far</p>
<p>progressed that when, on July 1.  We reached the earthworks thrown.</p>
<p>up early in the year for the defense of the place, he had almost</p>
<p>wholly disappeared, carrying off all his stores and munitions of war</p>
<p>except some little subsistence and eleven pieces of artillery.  A</p>
<p>strong rearguard remained to cover the retreat, and on my front the</p>
<p>usual encounters between advancing and retreating forces took place.</p>
<p>Just before reaching the intrenchments on the Lynchburg road, I came</p>
<p>upon an open space that was covered by a network of fallen trees and</p>
<p>underbrush, which had been slashed all along in front of the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>earthworks.  This made our progress very difficult, but I shortly</p>
<p>became satisfied that there were only a few of the enemy within the</p>
<p>works, so moving a battalion of cavalry that had joined me the day</p>
<p>before down the road as rapidly as the obstructions would permit, the</p>
<p>Confederate pickets quickly departed, and we gained possession of the</p>
<p>town.  Three siege guns, four caissons, a few stores, and a small</p>
<p>number of prisoners fell into my hands.</p>
<p>That same evening orders were issued to the army to push on from</p>
<p>Tullahoma in pursuit, for, as it was thought that we might not be</p>
<p>able to cross Elk River on account of its swollen condition, we could</p>
<p>do the enemy some damage by keeping close as possible at his heels.</p>
<p>I marched on the Winchester road at 3 o&#x27;clock on the 2d of July and</p>
<p>about 8 o&#x27;clock reached Elk River ford.  The stream was for the time</p>
<p>truly an impassable torrent, and all hope of crossing by the</p>
<p>Winchester ford had to be abandoned.  Deeming that further effort</p>
<p>should be made, however, under guidance of Card, I turned the head of</p>
<p>my column in the direction of Alisona, marching up the river and</p>
<p>nearly parallel with it till I came to Rock Creek.  With a little</p>
<p>delay we got across Rock Creek, which was also much swollen, and</p>
<p>finding a short distance above its mouth a ford on Elk River that</p>
<p>Card said was practicable, I determined to attempt it: Some of the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s cavalry were guarding this ford, but after a sharp little</p>
<p>skirmish my battalion of cavalry crossed and took up a strong</p>
<p>position on the other bank.  The stream was very high and the current</p>
<p>very swift, the water , tumbling along over its rocky bed in an</p>
<p>immense volume, but still it was fordable for infantry if means could</p>
<p>be devised by which the men could keep their feet.  A cable was</p>
<p>stretched across just below the ford as a lifeline for the weaker</p>
<p>ones, and then the men of the entire division having secured their</p>
<p>ammunition by placing the cartridge-boxes on their shoulders, the</p>
<p>column pushed cheerfully into the rushing current.  The men as they</p>
<p>entered the water joined each other in sets of four in a close</p>
<p>embrace, which enabled them to retain a foothold and successfully</p>
<p>resist the force of the flood.  When they were across I turned the</p>
<p>column down the left bank of Elk River, and driving the enemy from</p>
<p>some slight works near Estelle Springs, regained the Winchester road.</p>
<p>By this time it was clear that Bragg intended to fall back behind the</p>
<p>Tennessee River, and our only chance of accomplishing anything of</p>
<p>importance was to smash up his rear-guard before it crossed the</p>
<p>Cumberland Mountains, and in pursuance of this idea I was directed to</p>
<p>attack such of his force as was holding on to Winchester.  At 4</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock on the morning of July 2 I moved on that town, and when we</p>
<p>got close to it directed my mounted troops to charge a small force of</p>
<p>Confederate cavalry that was picketing their front.  The Confederates</p>
<p>resisted but little, and our men went with them in a disorderly chase</p>
<p>through the village to Boiling Fork, a small stream about half a mile</p>
<p>beyond.  Here the fleeing pickets, rallying behind a stronger force,</p>
<p>made a stand, and I was directed by McCook to delay till I</p>
<p>ascertained if Davis&#x27;s division, which was to support me, had made</p>
<p>the crossing of Elk River, and until I could open up communication</p>
<p>with Brannan&#x27;s division, which was to come in on my left at Decherd.</p>
<p>As soon as I learned that Davis was across I pushed on, but the delay</p>
<p>had permitted the enemy to pull his rear-guard up on the mountain,</p>
<p>and rendered nugatory all further efforts to hurt him materially, our</p>
<p>only returns consisting in forcing him to relinquish a small amount</p>
<p>of transportation and forage at the mouth of the pass just beyond</p>
<p>Cowan, a station on the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga</p>
<p>railroad.</p>
<p>At Cowan, Colonel Watkins, of the Sixth Kentucky Cavalry, reported to</p>
<p>me with twelve hundred mounted men.  Having heard during the night</p>
<p>that the enemy had halted on the mountain near the University--an</p>
<p>educational establishment on the summit--I directed Watkins to make a</p>
<p>reconnoissance and find out the value of the information.  He learned</p>
<p>that Wharton&#x27;s brigade of cavalry was halted at the University to</p>
<p>cover a moderately large force of the enemy&#x27;s infantry which had not</p>
<p>yet got down the mountain on the other side, so I pushed Watkins out</p>
<p>again on the 5th, supporting him by a brigade of infantry, which I</p>
<p>accompanied myself.  We were too late, however, for when we arrived</p>
<p>at the top of the mountain Wharton had disappeared, and though</p>
<p>Watkins pursued to Bridgeport, he was able to do nothing more, and on</p>
<p>his return reported that the last of the enemy had crossed the</p>
<p>Tennessee River and burned the railroad bridge.</p>
<p>Nothing further could now be done, so I instructed Watkins to rejoin</p>
<p>the division at Cowan, and being greatly fatigued by the hard</p>
<p>campaigning of the previous ten days, I concluded to go back to my</p>
<p>camp in a more comfortable way than on the back of my tired horse.</p>
<p>In his retreat the enemy had not disturbed the railway track at all,</p>
<p>and as we had captured a hand-car at Cowan, I thought I would have it</p>
<p>brought up to the station near the University to carry me down the</p>
<p>mountain to my camp, and, desiring company, I persuasively invited</p>
<p>Colonel Frank T. Sherman to ride with me.  I sent for the car by a</p>
<p>courier, and for a long time patiently awaited its arrival, in fact,</p>
<p>until all the returning troops had passed us, but still it did not</p>
<p>come.  Thinking it somewhat risky to remain at the station without</p>
<p>protection, Sherman and myself started our horses to Cowan by our</p>
<p>orderlies, and set out on foot to meet the car, trudging along down</p>
<p>the track in momentary expectation of falling in with our private</p>
<p>conveyance.  We had not gone very far before night overtook us, and</p>
<p>we then began to realize the dangers surrounding us, for there we</p>
<p>were alone and helpless, tramping on in the darkness over an unknown</p>
<p>railroad track in the enemy&#x27;s country, liable on the one hand to go</p>
<p>tumbling through some bridge or trestle, and on the other, to</p>
<p>possible capture or death at the hands of the guerrillas then</p>
<p>infesting these mountains.  Just after dark we came to a little cabin</p>
<p>near the track, where we made bold to ask for water, notwithstanding</p>
<p>the fact that to disclose ourselves to the inmates might lead to</p>
<p>fatal consequences.  The water was kindly given, but the owner and</p>
<p>his family were very much exercised lest some misfortune might befall</p>
<p>us near their house, and be charged to them, so they encouraged us to</p>
<p>move on with a frankness inspired by fear of future trouble to</p>
<p>themselves.</p>
<p>At every turn we eagerly hoped to meet the hand-car, but it never</p>
<p>came, and we jolted on from tie to tie for eleven weary miles,</p>
<p>reaching Cowan after midnight, exhausted and sore in every muscle</p>
<p>from frequent falls on the rough, unballasted road-bed.  Inquiry.</p>
<p>developed that the car had been well manned, and started to us as</p>
<p>ordered, and nobody could account for its non-arrival.  Further</p>
<p>investigation next day showed, however, that when it reached the foot</p>
<p>of the mountain, where the railroad formed a junction, the improvised</p>
<p>crew, in the belief no doubt that the University was on the main line</p>
<p>instead of near the branch to Tracy City, followed the main stem</p>
<p>until it carried them clear across the range down the Crow Creek</p>
<p>Valley, where the party was captured.</p>
<p>I had reason to remember for many a day this foolish adventure, for</p>
<p>my sore bones and bruised muscles, caused me physical suffering until</p>
<p>I left the Army of the Cumberland the next spring; but I had still</p>
<p>more reason to feel for my captured men, and on this account I have</p>
<p>never ceased to regret that I so thoughtlessly undertook to rejoin my</p>
<p>troops by rail, instead of sticking to my faithful horse.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
<p>ORDERED TO OCCUPY BRIDGEPORT--A SPY--THE BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA--</p>
<p>GENERAL THOMAS--TREATED TO COFFEE--RESULTS OF THE BATTLE.</p>
<p>The Tullahoma campaign was practically closed by the disappearance of</p>
<p>the enemy from the country north of the Tennessee River.  Middle</p>
<p>Tennessee was once more in the possession of the National troops, and</p>
<p>Rosecrans though strongly urged from Washington to continue on,</p>
<p>resisted the pressure until he could repair the Nashville and</p>
<p>Chattanooga railroad, which was of vital importance in supplying his</p>
<p>army from its secondary base at Nashville.  As he desired to hold</p>
<p>this road to where it crossed the Tennessee, it was necessary to push</p>
<p>a force beyond the mountains, and after a few days of rest at Cowan</p>
<p>my division was ordered to take station at Stevenson, Alabama, the</p>
<p>junction of the Memphis and Charleston road with the Nashville and</p>
<p>Chattanooga, with instructions to occupy Bridgeport also.</p>
<p>The enemy had meanwhile concentrated most of his forces at</p>
<p>Chattanooga for the twofold purpose of holding this gateway of the</p>
<p>Cumberland Mountains, and to assume a defensive attitude which would</p>
<p>enable him to take advantage of such circumstances as might arise in</p>
<p>the development of the offensive campaign he knew we must make.  The</p>
<p>peculiar topography of the country was much to his advantage, and</p>
<p>while we had a broad river and numerous spurs and ridges of the</p>
<p>Cumberland Mountains to cross at a long distance from our base, he</p>
<p>was backed up on his depots of supply, and connected by interior</p>
<p>lines of railway with the different armies of the Confederacy, so</p>
<p>that he could be speedily reinforced.</p>
<p>Bridgeport was to be ultimately a sub-depot for storing subsistence</p>
<p>supplies, and one of the points at which our army would cross the</p>
<p>Tennessee, so I occupied it on July 29 with two brigades, retaining</p>
<p>one at Stevenson, however, to protect that railway junction from</p>
<p>raids by way of Caperton&#x27;s ferry.  By the 29th of August a</p>
<p>considerable quantity of supplies had been accumulated, and then</p>
<p>began a general movement of our troops for crossing the river.  As</p>
<p>there were not with the army enough pontoons to complete the two</p>
<p>bridges required, I was expected to build one of them of trestles;</p>
<p>and a battalion of the First Michigan Engineers under Colonel Innis</p>
<p>was sent me to help construct the bridge.  Early on the 3ist I sent</p>
<p>into the neighboring woods about fifteen hundred men with axes and</p>
<p>teams, and by nightfall they had delivered on the riverbank fifteen</p>
<p>hundred logs suitable for a trestle bridge.  Flooring had been</p>
<p>shipped to me in advance by rail, but the quantity was insufficient,</p>
<p>and the lack had to be supplied by utilizing planking and weather-</p>
<p>boarding taken from barns and houses in the surrounding country.  The</p>
<p>next day Innis&#x27;s engineers, with the assistance of the detail that</p>
<p>had felled the timber, cut and half-notched the logs, and put the</p>
<p>bridge across; spanning the main channel, which was swimming deep,</p>
<p>with four or five pontoons that had been sent me for this purpose.</p>
<p>On the 2d and 3d of September my division crossed on the bridge in</p>
<p>safety, though we were delayed somewhat because of its giving way</p>
<p>once where the pontoons joined the trestles.  We were followed by a</p>
<p>few detachments from other commands, and by nearly all the</p>
<p>transportation of McCook&#x27;s corps.</p>
<p>After getting to the south side of the Tennessee River I was ordered</p>
<p>to Valley Head, where McCook&#x27;s corps was to concentrate.  On the 4th</p>
<p>of September I ascended Sand Mountain, but had got only half way</p>
<p>across the plateau, on top, when night came, the march having been a</p>
<p>most toilsome one.  The next day we descended to the base, and</p>
<p>encamped near Trenton.  On the l0th I arrived at Valley Head, and</p>
<p>climbing Lookout Mountain, encamped on the plateau at Indian Falls.</p>
<p>The following day I went down into Broomtown Valley to Alpine.</p>
<p>The march of McCook&#x27;s corps from Valley Head to Alpine was in</p>
<p>pursuance of orders directing it to advance on Summerville, the</p>
<p>possession of which place would further threaten the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>communications, it being assumed that Bragg was in full retreat</p>
<p>south, as he had abandoned Chattanooga on the 8th.  This assumption</p>
<p>soon proved erroneous, however, and as we, while in Broomtown Valley,</p>
<p>could not communicate directly with Thomas&#x27;s corps, the scattered</p>
<p>condition of the army began to alarm us all, and McCook abandoned the</p>
<p>advance to Summerville, ordering back to the summit of Lookout</p>
<p>Mountain such of the corps trains as had got down into Broomtown</p>
<p>Valley.</p>
<p>But before this I had grown uneasy in regard to the disjointed</p>
<p>situation of our army, and, to inform myself of what was going on,</p>
<p>determined to send a spy into the enemy&#x27;s lines.  In passing Valley</p>
<p>Head on the l0th my scout Card, who had been on the lookout for some</p>
<p>one capable to undertake the task, brought me a Union man with whom</p>
<p>he was acquainted, who lived on Sand Mountain, and had been much</p>
<p>persecuted by guerrillas on account of his loyal sentiments.  He knew</p>
<p>the country well, and as his loyalty was vouched for I asked him to</p>
<p>go into the enemy&#x27;s camp, which I believed to be near Lafayette, and,</p>
<p>bring me such information as he could gather.  He said such a journey</p>
<p>would be at the risk of his life, and that at best he could not</p>
<p>expect to remain in that section of country if he undertook it, but</p>
<p>that he would run all the chances if I would enable him to emigrate</p>
<p>to the West at the end c f the &quot;job,&quot; which I could do by purchasing</p>
<p>the small &quot;bunch&quot; of stock he owned on the mountain.  To this I</p>
<p>readily assented, and he started on the delicate undertaking.  He</p>
<p>penetrated the enemy&#x27;s lines with little difficulty, but while</p>
<p>prosecuting his search for information was suspected, and at once</p>
<p>arrested and placed under guard.  From this critical situation he</p>
<p>escaped; however, making his way through the enemy&#x27;s picket-line in</p>
<p>the darkness by crawling on his belly and deceiving the sentinels by</p>
<p>imitating the grunts of the half-wild, sand-colored hogs with which</p>
<p>the country abounded.  He succeeded in reaching Rosecrans&#x27;s</p>
<p>headquarters finally, and there gave the definite information that</p>
<p>Bragg intended to fight, and that he expected to be reinforced by</p>
<p>Longstreet.</p>
<p>By this time it was clear that Bragg had abandoned Chattanooga with</p>
<p>the sole design of striking us in detail as we followed in pursuit;</p>
<p>and to prevent his achieving this purpose orders came at 12 o&#x27;clock,</p>
<p>midnight, for McCook to draw in toward Chattanooga.  This could be</p>
<p>done only by recrossing Lookout Mountain, the enemy&#x27;s army at</p>
<p>Lafayette now interposing between us and Thomas&#x27;s corps.  The</p>
<p>retrograde march began at once.  I moved back over the mountain on</p>
<p>the 13th and 14th to Stevens&#x27;s Mills, and on the 15th and 16th</p>
<p>recrossed through Stevens&#x27;s Gap, in the Lookout range, and encamped</p>
<p>at its base in McLamore&#x27;s cove.  The march was made with all possible</p>
<p>celerity, for the situation was critical and demanded every exertion.</p>
<p>The ascent and descent of the mountains was extremely exhausting, the</p>
<p>steep grades often rendering it necessary to drag up and let down by</p>
<p>hand both the transportation and artillery.  But at last we were in</p>
<p>conjunction with the main army, and my division breathed easier.</p>
<p>On the 17th I remained in line of battle all day and night in front</p>
<p>of McLamore&#x27;s cove, the enemy making slight demonstrations against me</p>
<p>from the direction of Lafayette.  The main body of the army having</p>
<p>bodily moved to the left meanwhile, I followed it on the 18th,</p>
<p>encamping at Pond Spring.  On the 19th I resumed the march to the</p>
<p>left and went into line of battle at Crawfish Springs to cover our</p>
<p>right and rear.  Immediately after forming this line, I again became</p>
<p>isolated by the general movement to the left, and in consequence was</p>
<p>directed to advance and hold the ford of Chickamauga Creek at Lee and</p>
<p>Gordon&#x27;s Mills, thus coming into close communication with the balance</p>
<p>of our forces.  I moved into this position rapidly, being compelled,</p>
<p>though, first to drive back the enemy&#x27;s cavalry skirmishers, who,</p>
<p>having crossed to the west side of the creek, annoyed the right flank</p>
<p>of my column a good deal while en route.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Lee and Gordon&#x27;s Mills I found the ford over</p>
<p>Chickamauga Creek temporarily uncovered, through the hurried movement</p>
<p>of Wood to the assistance of Davis&#x27;s division.  The enemy was already</p>
<p>present in small force, with the evident intention of taking</p>
<p>permanent possession, but my troops at once actively engaged him and</p>
<p>recovered the ford with some slight losses.  Scarcely had this been</p>
<p>done when I was directed to assist Crittenden.  Leaving Lytle&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade at the ford, I proceeded with Bradley&#x27;s and Laiboldt&#x27;s to</p>
<p>help Crittenden, whose main line was formed to the east of the</p>
<p>Chattanooga and Lafayette road, its right trending toward a point on</p>
<p>Chickamauga Creek about a mile and a half north of Lee and Gordon&#x27;s</p>
<p>Mills.  By the time I had joined Crittenden with my two brigades,</p>
<p>Davis had been worsted in an attack Rosecrans had ordered him to make</p>
<p>on the left of that portion of the enemy&#x27;s line which was located</p>
<p>along the west bank of the Chickamauga, the repulse being so severe</p>
<p>that one of Davis&#x27;s batteries had to be abandoned.  Bradley&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>arrived on the ground first and was hastily formed and thrown into</p>
<p>the fight, which up to this moment had been very doubtful, fortune</p>
<p>inclining first to one side, then to the other.  Bradley&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>went in with steadiness, and charging across an open corn-field that</p>
<p>lay in front of the Lafayette road, recovered Davis&#x27;s guns and forced</p>
<p>the enemy to retire.  Meanwhile Laiboldt&#x27;s brigade had come on the</p>
<p>scene, and forming it on Bradley&#x27;s right, I found myself at the end</p>
<p>of the contest holding the ground which was Davis&#x27;s original</p>
<p>position.  It was an ugly fight and my loss was heavy, including</p>
<p>Bradley wounded.  The temporary success was cheering, and when</p>
<p>Lytle&#x27;s brigade joined me a little later I suggested to Crittenden</p>
<p>that we attack, but investigation showed that his troops, having been</p>
<p>engaged all day, were not in condition, so the suggestion could not</p>
<p>be carried out.</p>
<p>The events of the day had indicated that Bragg&#x27;s main object was to</p>
<p>turn Rosecrans&#x27;s left; it was therefore still deemed necessary that</p>
<p>the army should continue its flank movement to the left, so orders</p>
<p>came to draw my troops in toward the widow Glenn&#x27;s house.  By</p>
<p>strengthening the skirmish line and shifting my brigades in</p>
<p>succession from right to left until the point designated was reached,</p>
<p>I was able to effect the withdrawal without much difficulty, calling</p>
<p>in my skirmish line after the main force had retired.</p>
<p>My command having settled down for the night in this new line I rode</p>
<p>to army headquarters, to learn if possible the expectations for the</p>
<p>morrow and hear the result of the battle in General Thomas&#x27;s front.</p>
<p>Nearly all the superior officers of the army were at headquarters,</p>
<p>and it struck me that much depression prevailed, notwithstanding the</p>
<p>fact that the enemy&#x27;s attempts during the day to turn our left flank</p>
<p>and also envelop our right had been unsuccessful.  It was now</p>
<p>positively known, through prisoners and otherwise, that Bragg had</p>
<p>been reinforced to such an extent as to make him materially outnumber</p>
<p>us, consequently there was much apprehension for the future.</p>
<p>The necessity of protecting our left was most apparent, and the next</p>
<p>day the drifting in that direction was to be continued.  This</p>
<p>movement in the presence of the enemy, who at all points was actively</p>
<p>seeking an opportunity to penetrate our line and interpose a column</p>
<p>between its right and left, was most dangerous.  But the necessity</p>
<p>for shifting the army to the left was obvious, hence only the method</p>
<p>by which it was undertaken is open to question.  The move was made by</p>
<p>the flank in the face of an exultant foe superior in numbers, and was</p>
<p>a violation of a simple and fundamental military principle.  Under</p>
<p>such circumstauces columns naturally stretch out into attenuated</p>
<p>lines, organizations become separated, and intervals occur, all of</p>
<p>which we experienced; and had the orders for the movement been</p>
<p>construed properly I doubt if it could have been executed without</p>
<p>serious danger.  Necessity knows no law, however, and when all the</p>
<p>circumstances of this battle are fully considered it is possible that</p>
<p>justification may be found for the manoeuvres by which the army was</p>
<p>thus drifted to the left.  We were in a bad strait unquestionably,</p>
<p>and under such conditions possibly the exception had to be applied</p>
<p>rather than the rule.</p>
<p>At daylight on the morning of the 20th a dense fog obscured</p>
<p>everything; consequently both armies were passive so far as fighting</p>
<p>was concerned.  Rosecrans took advantage of the inaction to rearrange</p>
<p>his right, and I was pulled back closer to the widow Glenn&#x27;s house to</p>
<p>a strong position, where I threw together some rails and logs as</p>
<p>barricades, but I was disconnected from the troops on my left by a</p>
<p>considerable interval.  Here I awaited the approach of the enemy, but</p>
<p>he did not disturb me, although about 9 o&#x27;clock in the forenoon he</p>
<p>had opened on our extreme left with musketry fire and a heavy</p>
<p>cannonade.  Two hours later it was discovered by McCook that the</p>
<p>interval between the main army and me was widening, and he ordered me</p>
<p>to send Laiboldt&#x27;s brigade to occupy a portion of the front that had</p>
<p>been covered by Negley&#x27;s division.  Before getting this brigade into</p>
<p>place, however, two small brigades of Davis&#x27;s division occupied the</p>
<p>ground, and I directed Laiboldt to form in column of regiments on the</p>
<p>crest of a low ridge in rear of Carlin&#x27;s brigade, so as to prevent</p>
<p>Davis&#x27;s right flank from being turned.  The enemy was now feeling</p>
<p>Davis strongly, and I was about sending for Lytle&#x27;s and Bradley&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigades when I received an order to move these rapidly to the,</p>
<p>extreme left of the army to the assistance of General Thomas.  I rode</p>
<p>hastily back toward their position, but in the meanwhile, they had</p>
<p>been notified by direct orders from McCook, and were moving out at a</p>
<p>double-quick toward the Lafayette road.  By this time the enemy had</p>
<p>assaulted Davis furiously in front and flank, and driven him from his</p>
<p>line, and as the confused mass came back, McCook ordered Laiboldt to</p>
<p>charge by deploying to the front.  This he did through Davis&#x27;s broken</p>
<p>ranks, but failed to check the enemy&#x27;s heavy lines, and finally</p>
<p>Laiboldt&#x27;s brigade broke also and fell to the rear.  My remaining</p>
<p>troops, headed by Lytle, were now passing along the rear of the</p>
<p>ground where this disaster took place--in column on the road--en</p>
<p>route to Thomas, and as the hundreds of fugitives rushed back, McCook</p>
<p>directed me to throw in Lytle&#x27;s and Bradley&#x27;s brigades.  This was</p>
<p>hastily done, they being formed to the front under a terrible fire.</p>
<p>Scarcely were they aligned when the same horde of Confederates that</p>
<p>had overwhelmed Davis and Laiboldt poured in upon them a deadly fire</p>
<p>and shivered the two brigades to pieces.  We succeeded in rallying</p>
<p>them, however, and by a counter attack regained the ridge that</p>
<p>Laiboldt had been driven from, where we captured the colors of the</p>
<p>Twenty-fourth Alabama.  We could not hold the ridge, though, and my</p>
<p>troops were driven back with heavy loss, including General Lytle</p>
<p>killed, past the widow Glenn&#x27;s house, and till I managed to establish</p>
<p>them in line of battle on a range of low hills behind the Dry Valley</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>During these occurrences General Rosecrans passed down the road</p>
<p>behind my line, and sent word that he wished to see me, but affairs</p>
<p>were too critical to admit of my going to him at once, and he rode on</p>
<p>to Chattanooga.  It is to be regretted that he did not wait till I</p>
<p>could join him, for the delay would have permitted him to see that</p>
<p>matters were not in quite such bad shape as he supposed; still, there</p>
<p>is no disguising the fact that at this juncture his army was badly</p>
<p>crippled.</p>
<p>Shortly after my division had rallied on the low hills already</p>
<p>described, I discovered that the enemy, instead of attacking me in</p>
<p>front, was wedging in between my division and the balance of the</p>
<p>army; in short, endeavoring to cut me off from Chattanooga.  This</p>
<p>necessitated another retrograde movement, which brought me back to</p>
<p>the southern face of Missionary Ridge, where I was joined by Carlin&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade of Davis&#x27;s division.  Still thinking I could join General</p>
<p>Thomas, I rode some distance to the left of my line to look for a way</p>
<p>out, but found that the enemy had intervened so far as to isolate me</p>
<p>effectually.  I then determined to march directly to Rossville, and</p>
<p>from there effect a junction with Thomas by the Lafayette road.  I</p>
<p>reached Rossville about o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, bringing with me</p>
<p>eight guns, forty-six caissons, and a long ammunition train, the</p>
<p>latter having been found in a state of confusion behind the widow</p>
<p>Glenn&#x27;s when I was being driven back behind the Dry Valley road.</p>
<p>The head of my column passed through Rossville, appearing upon</p>
<p>Thomas&#x27;s left about 6 o&#x27;clock in the evening, penetrated without any</p>
<p>opposition the right of the enemy&#x27;s line, and captured several of his</p>
<p>field-hospitals.  As soon as I got on the field I informed Thomas of</p>
<p>the presence of my command, and asked for orders.  He replied that</p>
<p>his lines were disorganized, and that it would be futile to attack;</p>
<p>that all I could do was to hold on, and aid in covering his</p>
<p>withdrawal to Rossville.</p>
<p>I accompanied him back to Rossville, and when we reached the skirt of</p>
<p>the little hamlet General Thomas halted and we dismounted.  Going</p>
<p>into one of the angles of a worm fence near by I took a rail from the</p>
<p>top and put it through the lower rails at a proper height from the</p>
<p>ground to make a seat, and General Thomas and I sat down while, my</p>
<p>troops were moving by.  The General appeared very much exhausted,</p>
<p>seemed to forget what he had stopped for, and said little or nothing</p>
<p>of the incidents of the day.  This was the second occasion on which I</p>
<p>had met him in the midst of misfortune, for during the fight in the</p>
<p>cedars at Stone River, when our prospects were most disheartening, we</p>
<p>held a brief conversation respecting the line he was then taking up</p>
<p>for the purpose of helping me.  At other times, in periods of</p>
<p>inactivity, I saw but little of him.  He impressed me, now as he did</p>
<p>in the cedars, his quiet, unobtrusive: demeanor communicating a</p>
<p>gloomy rather than a hopeful view of the situation.  This apparent</p>
<p>depression was due no doubt to the severe trial through which he had</p>
<p>gone in the last forty-eight hours, which, strain had exhausted him</p>
<p>very much both physically and mentally.  His success in maintaining</p>
<p>his ground was undoubtedly largely influenced by the fact that two-</p>
<p>thirds of the National forces had been sent to his succor, but his</p>
<p>firm purpose to save the army was the mainstay on which all relied</p>
<p>after Rosecrans left the field.  As the command was getting pretty</p>
<p>well past, I rose to go in order to put my troops into camp.  This</p>
<p>aroused the General, when, remarking that he had a little flask of</p>
<p>brandy in his saddle-holster, he added that he had just stopped for</p>
<p>the purpose of offering me a drink, as he knew I must be very tired.</p>
<p>He requested one of his staff-officers to get the flask, and after</p>
<p>taking a sip himself, passed it to me.  Refreshed by the brandy,I</p>
<p>mounted and rode off to supervise the encamping of my division, by no</p>
<p>means an easy task considering the darkness, and the confusion that</p>
<p>existed among the troops that had preceded us into Rossville.</p>
<p>This done, I lay down at the foot of a tree, with my saddle for a</p>
<p>pillow, and saddle-blanket for a cover.  Some soldiers near me having</p>
<p>built a fire, were making coffee, and I guess I must have been</p>
<p>looking on wistfully, for in a little while they brought me a tin-</p>
<p>cupful of the coffee and a small piece of hard bread, which I</p>
<p>relished keenly, it being the first food that had passed my lips</p>
<p>since the night before.  I was very tired, very hungry, and much</p>
<p>discouraged by what had taken place since morning.  I had been</p>
<p>obliged to fight my command under the most disadvantageous</p>
<p>circumstances, disconnected, without supports, without even</p>
<p>opportunity to form in line of battle, and at one time contending</p>
<p>against four divisions of the enemy.  In this battle of Chickamauga,</p>
<p>out of an effective strength Of 4,000 bayonets, I had lost 1,517</p>
<p>officers and men, including two brigade commanders.  This was not</p>
<p>satisfactory indeed, it was most depressing--and then there was much</p>
<p>confusion prevailing around Rossville; and, this condition of things</p>
<p>doubtless increasing my gloomy reflections, it did not seem to me</p>
<p>that the outlook for the next day was at all auspicious, unless the</p>
<p>enemy was slow to improve his present advantage.  Exhaustion soon</p>
<p>quieted all forebodings, though, and I fell into a sound sleep, from</p>
<p>which I was not aroused till daylight.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st the enemy failed to advance, and his</p>
<p>inaction gave us the opportunity for getting the broken and</p>
<p>disorganized army into shape.  It took a large part of the day to</p>
<p>accomplish this, and the chances of complete victory would have been</p>
<p>greatly in Bragg&#x27;s favor if he could have attacked us vigorously at</p>
<p>this time.  But he had been badly hurt in the two days&#x27; conflict, and</p>
<p>his inactivity on the 21st showed that he too had to go through the</p>
<p>process of reorganization.  Indeed, his crippled condition began to</p>
<p>show itself the preceding evening, and I have always thought that,</p>
<p>had General Thomas held on and attacked the Confederate right and</p>
<p>rear from where I made the junction with him on the Lafayette road,</p>
<p>the field of Chickamauga would have been relinquished to us; but it</p>
<p>was fated to be otherwise.</p>
<p>Rosecrans, McCook, and Crittenden passed out of the battle when they</p>
<p>went back to Chattanooga, and their absence was discouraging to all</p>
<p>aware of it.  Doubtless this had much to do with Thomas&#x27;s final</p>
<p>withdrawal, thus leaving the field to the enemy, though at an immense</p>
<p>cost in killed and wounded.  The night of the 21st the army moved</p>
<p>back from Rossville, and my division, as the rearguard of the</p>
<p>Twentieth Corps, got within our lines at Chattanooga about 8 o&#x27;clock</p>
<p>the morning of the 22d.  Our unmolested retirement from Rossville</p>
<p>lent additional force to the belief that the enemy had been badly</p>
<p>injured, and further impressed me with the conviction that we might</p>
<p>have held on.  Indeed, the battle of Chickamauga was somewhat like</p>
<p>that of Stone River, victory resting with the side that had the grit</p>
<p>to defer longest its relinquishment of the field.</p>
<p>The manoeuvres by which Rosecrans had carried his army over the</p>
<p>Cumberland Mountains, crossed the Tennessee River, and possessed</p>
<p>himself of Chattanooga, merit the highest commendation up to the</p>
<p>abandonment of this town by Bragg on the 8th of September; but I have</p>
<p>always fancied that that evacuation made Rosecrans over-confident,</p>
<p>and led him to think that he could force Bragg south as far as Rome.</p>
<p>After the Union army passed the river and Chattanooga fell into our</p>
<p>hands; we still kept pressing the enemy&#x27;s communications, and the</p>
<p>configuration of the country necessitated more or less isolation of</p>
<p>the different corps.  McCook&#x27;s corps of three divisions had crossed</p>
<p>two difficult ridges--Sand and Lookout mountains--to Alpine in</p>
<p>Broomtown Valley with intentions against Summerville.  Thomas&#x27;s corps</p>
<p>had marched by the way of Stevens&#x27;s Gap toward Lafayette, which he</p>
<p>expected to occupy.  Crittenden had passed through Chattanooga, at</p>
<p>first directing his march an Ringgold.  Thus the corps of the army</p>
<p>were not in conjunction, and between McCook and Thomas there</p>
<p>intervened a positive and aggressive obstacle in the shape of Bragg&#x27;s</p>
<p>army concentrating and awaiting reinforcement at Lafayette.  Under</p>
<p>these circumstances Bragg could have taken the different corps in</p>
<p>detail, and it is strange that he did not, even before receiving his</p>
<p>reinforcements, turn on McCook in Broomtown Valley and destroy him.</p>
<p>Intelligence that Bragg would give battle began to come to us from</p>
<p>various sources as early as the l0th of September, and on the 11th</p>
<p>McCook found that he could not communicate with Thomas by the direct</p>
<p>road through Broomtown Valley; but we did not begin closing in toward</p>
<p>Chattanooga till the 13th, and even then the Twentieth Corps had</p>
<p>before it the certainty of many delays that must necessarily result</p>
<p>from the circuitous and difficult mountain roads which we would be</p>
<p>obliged to follow.  Had the different corps, beginning with McCook&#x27;s,</p>
<p>been drawn in toward Chattanooga between the 8th and 12th of</p>
<p>September, the objective point of the campaign would have remained in</p>
<p>our hands without the battle of Chickamauga, but, as has been seen,</p>
<p>this was not done.  McCook was almost constantly on the march day and</p>
<p>night between the 13th and the 19th, ascending and descending</p>
<p>mountains, his men worried and wearied, so that when they appeared on</p>
<p>the battle-field, their fatigued condition operated greatly against</p>
<p>their efficiency.  This delay in concentration was also the original</p>
<p>cause of the continuous shifting toward our left to the support of</p>
<p>Thomas, by which manoeuvre Rosecrans endeavored to protect his</p>
<p>communications with Chattanooga, and out of which grew the intervals</p>
<p>that offered such tempting opportunities to Bragg.  In addition to</p>
<p>all this, much transpired on the field of battle tending to bring</p>
<p>about disaster.  There did not seem to be any well-defined plan of</p>
<p>action in the fighting; and this led to much independence of judgment</p>
<p>in construing orders among some of the subordinate generals.  It also</p>
<p>gave rise to much license in issuing orders: too many people were</p>
<p>giving important directions, affecting the whole army, without</p>
<p>authority from its head.  In view, therefore, of all the errors that</p>
<p>were committed from the time Chattanooga fell into our hands after</p>
<p>our first crossing the Tennessee, it was fortunate that the Union</p>
<p>defeat was not more complete, that it left in the enemy&#x27;s possession</p>
<p>not much more than the barren results arising from the simple holding</p>
<p>of the ground on which the engagement was fought.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
<p>AT CHATTANOOGA--THE ENEMY FORTIFIES LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN AND MISSIONARY</p>
<p>RIDGE--REORGANIZING THE ARMY--REMOVAL OF GENERAL ROSECRANS--</p>
<p>PUNISHMENT OF DESERTERS--GRANT AT CHATTANOOGA--THE FIGHT ON LOOKOUT</p>
<p>MOUNTAIN--A BRAVE COLOR-BEARER--BATTLE OF MISSIONARY RIDGE.</p>
<p>By 9 o&#x27;clock on the morning of September 22 my command took up a</p>
<p>position within the heavy line of intrenchments at Chattanooga, the</p>
<p>greater part of which defenses had been thrown up since the army</p>
<p>commenced arriving there the day before.  The enemy, having now</p>
<p>somewhat recovered from the shock of the recent battle, followed</p>
<p>carefully, and soon invested us close into our lines with a parallel</p>
<p>system of rifle-pits.  He also began at once to erect permanent lines</p>
<p>of earthworks on Missionary Ridge and to establish himself strongly</p>
<p>on Lookout Mountain.  He then sent Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry north of the</p>
<p>Tennessee, and, aided greatly by the configuration of the ground,</p>
<p>held us in a state of partial siege, which serious rains might</p>
<p>convert into a complete investment.  The occupation of Lookout</p>
<p>Mountain broke our direct communication with Bridgeport-our sub-</p>
<p>depot--and forced us to bring supplies by way of the Sequatchie</p>
<p>Valley and Waldron&#x27;s Ridge of the Cumberland Mountains, over a road</p>
<p>most difficult even in the summer season, but now liable to be</p>
<p>rendered impassable by autumn rains.  The distance to Bridgeport by</p>
<p>this circuitous route was sixty miles, and the numerous passes,</p>
<p>coves, and small valleys through which the road ran offered tempting</p>
<p>opportunities, for the destruction of trains, and the enemy was not</p>
<p>slow to take advantage of them.  Indeed, the situation was not</p>
<p>promising, and General Rosecrans himself, in communicating with the</p>
<p>President the day succeeding the battle of Chickamauga, expressed</p>
<p>doubts of his ability to hold the gateway of the Cumberland</p>
<p>Mountains.</p>
<p>The position taken up by my troops inside the lines of Chattanooga</p>
<p>was near the old iron-works, under the shadow of Lookout Mountain.</p>
<p>Here we were exposed to a continual fire from the enemy&#x27;s batteries</p>
<p>for many days, but as the men were well covered by secure though</p>
<p>simple intrenchments, but little damage was done.  My own</p>
<p>headquarters were established on the grounds of Mr. William</p>
<p>Crutchfield, a resident of the place, whose devotion to the Union</p>
<p>cause knew no bounds, and who rendered me--and, in fact, at one time</p>
<p>or another, nearly every general officer in the Army of the</p>
<p>Cumberland--invaluable service in the way of information about the</p>
<p>Confederate army.  My headquarters camp frequently received shots</p>
<p>from the point of Lookout Mountain also, but fortunately no</p>
<p>casualties resulted from this plunging fire, though, I am free to</p>
<p>confess, at first our nerves were often upset by the whirring of</p>
<p>twenty-pounder shells dropped inconsiderately into our camp at</p>
<p>untimely hours of the night.</p>
<p>In a few days rain began to fali, and the mountain roads by which our</p>
<p>supplies came were fast growing impracticable.  Each succeeding train</p>
<p>of wagons took longer to make the trip from Bridgeport, and the draft</p>
<p>mules were dying by the hundreds.  The artillery horses would soon go</p>
<p>too, and there was every prospect that later the troops would starve</p>
<p>unless something could be done.  Luckily for my division, a company</p>
<p>of the Second Kentucky Cavalry had attached itself to my</p>
<p>headquarters, and, though there without authority, had been left</p>
<p>undisturbed in view of a coming reorganization of the army incidental</p>
<p>to the removal of McCook and Crittenden from the command of their</p>
<p>respective corps, a measure that had been determined upon immediately</p>
<p>after the battle of Chickamauga.  Desiring to remain with me, Captain</p>
<p>Lowell H. Thickstun, commanding this company, was ready for any duty</p>
<p>I might find, for him, so I ordered him into the Sequatchie Valley</p>
<p>for the purpose of collecting supplies for my troops, and sent my</p>
<p>scout, Card along to guide him to the best locations.  The company</p>
<p>hid itself away in a deep cove in the upper end of the valley, and by</p>
<p>keeping very quiet and paying for everything it took from the people,</p>
<p>in a few days was enabled to send me large quantities of corn for my</p>
<p>animals and food for the officers and men, which greatly supplemented</p>
<p>the scanty supplies we were getting from the sub-depot at Bridgeport.</p>
<p>In this way I carried men and animals through our beleaguerment in</p>
<p>pretty fair condition, and of the turkeys, chickens, ducks, and eggs</p>
<p>sent in for the messes of my officers we often had enough to divide</p>
<p>liberally among those at different headquarters.  Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry</p>
<p>never discovered my detached company, yet the chances of its capture</p>
<p>were not small, sometimes giving much uneasiness; still, I concluded</p>
<p>it was better to run all risks than to let the horses die of</p>
<p>starvation in Chattanooga.  Later, after the battle of Missionary</p>
<p>Ridge, when I started to Knoxville, the company joined me in</p>
<p>excellent shape, bringing with it an abundance of food, including a</p>
<p>small herd of beef cattle.</p>
<p>The whole time my line remained near the iron-mills the shelling from</p>
<p>Lookout was kept up, the screeching shots inquisitively asking in</p>
<p>their well-known way, &quot;Where are you? Where are you?&quot; but it is</p>
<p>strange to see how readily, soldiers can become accustomed to the</p>
<p>sound of dangerous missiles under circumstances of familiarity, and</p>
<p>this case was no exception to the rule.  Few casualties occurred, and</p>
<p>soon contempt took the place of nervousness, and as we could not</p>
<p>reply in kind on account of the elevation required for our guns, the</p>
<p>men responded by jeers and imprecations whenever a shell fell into</p>
<p>their camp.</p>
<p>Meantime, orders having been issued for the organization of the army,</p>
<p>additional troops were attached to my command, and it became the</p>
<p>Second Division of the Fourth Army Corps, to which Major-General</p>
<p>Gordon Granger was assigned as commander.  This necessitated a change</p>
<p>of position of the division, and I moved to ground behind our works,</p>
<p>with my right resting on Fort Negley and my left extending well over</p>
<p>toward Fort Wood, my front being parallel to Missionary Ridge.  My</p>
<p>division was now composed of twenty-five regiments, classified into</p>
<p>brigades and demi-brigades, the former commanded by Brigadier-General</p>
<p>G. D. Wagner, Colonel C. G. Harker, and Colonel F. T. Sherman; the</p>
<p>latter, by Colonels Laiboldt, Miller, Wood, Walworth, and Opdyke.</p>
<p>The demi-brigade was an awkward invention of Granger&#x27;s; but at this</p>
<p>time it was necessitated--perhaps by the depleted condition of our</p>
<p>regiments, which compelled the massing of a great number of</p>
<p>regimental organizations into a division to give it weight and force.</p>
<p>On October 16, 1863, General Grant had been assigned to the command</p>
<p>of the &quot;Military Division of the Mississippi,&quot; a geographical area</p>
<p>which embraced the Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the</p>
<p>Tennessee, thus effecting a consolidation of divided commands which</p>
<p>might have been introduced most profitably at an earlier date.  The</p>
<p>same order that assigned General Grant relieved General Rosecrans,</p>
<p>and placed General Thomas in command of the Army of the Cumberland.</p>
<p>At the time of the reception of the order, Rosecrans was busy with</p>
<p>preparations for a movement to open the direct road to Bridgeport--</p>
<p>having received in the interval, since we came back to Chattanooga,</p>
<p>considerable reinforcement by the arrival in his department of the</p>
<p>Eleventh and Twelfth corps, under General Hooker, from the Army of</p>
<p>the Potomac.  With this force Rosecrans had already strengthened</p>
<p>certain important points on the railroad between Nashville and</p>
<p>Stevenson, and given orders to Hooker to concentrate at Bridgeport</p>
<p>such portions of his command as were available, and to hold them in</p>
<p>readiness to advance toward Chattanooga.</p>
<p>On the 19th of October, after turning the command over to Thomas,</p>
<p>General Rosecrans quietly slipped away from the army.  He submitted _</p>
<p>uncomplainingly to his removal, and modestly left us without fuss or</p>
<p>demonstration; ever maintaining, though, that the battle of</p>
<p>Chickamauga was in effect a victory, as it had ensured us, he said,</p>
<p>the retention of Chattanooga.  When his departure became known deep</p>
<p>and almost universal regret was expressed, for he was</p>
<p>enthusiastically esteemed and loved by the Army of the Cumberland,</p>
<p>from the day he assumed command of it until he left it,</p>
<p>notwithstanding the censure poured upon him after the battle of</p>
<p>Chickamauga.</p>
<p>The new position to which my division had been moved, in consequence</p>
<p>of the reorganization, required little additional labor to strengthen</p>
<p>it, and the routine of fatigue duty and drills was continued as</p>
<p>before, its monotony occasionally broken by the excitement of an</p>
<p>expected attack, or by amusements of various kinds that were</p>
<p>calculated to keep the men in good spirits.  Toward this result much</p>
<p>was contributed by Mr. James E. Murdock, the actor, who came down</p>
<p>from the North to recover the body of his son, killed at Chickamauga,</p>
<p>and was quartered with me for the greater part of the time he was</p>
<p>obliged to await the successful conclusion of his sad mission.  He</p>
<p>spent days, and even weeks, going about through the division giving</p>
<p>recitations before the camp-fires, and in improvised chapels, which</p>
<p>the men had constructed from refuse lumber and canvas.  Suiting his</p>
<p>selections to the occasion, he never failed to excite intense</p>
<p>interest in the breasts of all present, and when circumstances</p>
<p>finally separated him from us, all felt that a debt of gratitude was</p>
<p>due him that could never be paid.  The pleasure he gave, and the</p>
<p>confident feeling that was now arising from expected reinforcements,</p>
<p>was darkened, however, by one sad incident.  Three men of my division</p>
<p>had deserted their colors at the beginning of the siege and made</p>
<p>their way north.  They were soon arrested, and were brought back to</p>
<p>stand trial for the worst offense that can be committed by a soldier,</p>
<p>convicted of the crime, and ordered to be shot.  To make the example</p>
<p>effective I paraded the whole division for the execution, and on the</p>
<p>13th of November, in the presence of their former comrades, the</p>
<p>culprits were sent, in accordance with the terms of their sentence,</p>
<p>to render their account to the Almighty.  It was the saddest</p>
<p>spectacle I ever witnessed, but there could be no evasion, no</p>
<p>mitigation of the full letter of the law; its timely enforcement was</p>
<p>but justice to the brave spirits who had yet to fight the rebellion</p>
<p>to the end.</p>
<p>General Grant arrived at Chattanooga on October 23, and began at once</p>
<p>to carry out the plans that had been formed for opening the shorter</p>
<p>or river road to Bridgeport.  This object was successfully</p>
<p>accomplished by the moving of Hooker&#x27;s command to Rankin&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Brown&#x27;s ferries in concert with a force from the Army of the</p>
<p>Cumberland which was directed on the same points, so by the 27th of</p>
<p>October direct communication with our depots was established.  The</p>
<p>four weeks which followed this cheering result were busy with the</p>
<p>work of refitting and preparing for offensive operations as soon as</p>
<p>General Sherman should reach us with his troops from West Tennessee.</p>
<p>During this period of activity the enemy committed the serious fault</p>
<p>of detaching Longstreet&#x27;s corps--sending it to aid in the siege of</p>
<p>Knoxville in East Tennessee--an error which has no justification</p>
<p>whatever, unless it be based on the presumption that it was</p>
<p>absolutely necessary that Longstreet should ultimately rejoin Lee&#x27;s</p>
<p>army in Virginia by way of Knoxville and Lynchburg, with a chance of</p>
<p>picking up Burnside en route.  Thus depleted, Bragg still held</p>
<p>Missionary Ridge in strong force, but that part of his line which</p>
<p>extended across the intervening valley to the northerly point of.</p>
<p>Lookout Mountain was much attenuated.</p>
<p>By the 18th of November General Grant had issued instructions</p>
<p>covering his intended operations.  They contemplated that Sherman&#x27;s</p>
<p>column, which was arriving by the north bank of the Tennessee, should</p>
<p>cross the river on a pontoon bridge just below the mouth of</p>
<p>Chickamauga Creek and carry the northern extremity of Missionary</p>
<p>Ridge as far as the railroad tunnel; that the Army of the Cumberland-</p>
<p>-the centre--should co-operate with Sherman; and that Hooker with a</p>
<p>mixed command should continue to hold Lookout Valley and operate on</p>
<p>our extreme right as circumstances might warrant.  Sherman crossed on</p>
<p>the 24th to perform his alloted part of the programme, but in the</p>
<p>meantime Grant becoming impressed with the idea that Bragg was</p>
<p>endeavoring to get away, ordered Thomas to make a strong</p>
<p>demonstration in his front, to determine the truth or falsity of the</p>
<p>information that had been received.  This task fell to the Fourth</p>
<p>Corps, and at 12 o&#x27;clock on the 23d I was notified that Wood&#x27;s</p>
<p>division would make a reconnoissance to an elevated point in its</p>
<p>front called Orchard Knob, and that I was to support it with my</p>
<p>division and prevent Wood&#x27;s right flank from being turned by an</p>
<p>advance of the enemy on Moore&#x27;s road or from the direction of</p>
<p>Rossville.  For this duty I marched my division out of the works</p>
<p>about 2 p.m., and took up a position on Bushy Knob.  Shortly after we</p>
<p>reached this point Wood&#x27;s division passed my left flank on its</p>
<p>reconnoissance, and my command, moving in support of it, drove in the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s picket-line.  Wood&#x27;s took possession of Orchard Knob easily,</p>
<p>and mine was halted on a low ridge to the right of the Knob, where I</p>
<p>was directed by General Thomas to cover my front by a strong line of</p>
<p>rifle-pits, and to put in position two batteries of the Fourth</p>
<p>regular artillery that had joined me from the Eleventh Corps.  After</p>
<p>dark Wood began to feel uneasy about his right flank, for a gap</p>
<p>existed between it and my left, so I moved in closer to him, taking</p>
<p>up a line where I remained inactive till the 25th, but suffering some</p>
<p>inconvenience from the enemy&#x27;s shells.</p>
<p>On the 24th General Sherman made an attack for the purpose of</p>
<p>carrying the north end of Missionary Ridge.  His success was not</p>
<p>complete, although at the time it was reported throughout the army to</p>
<p>be so.  It had the effect of disconcerting Bragg, however, and caused</p>
<p>him to strengthen his right by withdrawing troops from his left,</p>
<p>which circumstance led Hooker to advance on the northerly face of</p>
<p>Lookout Mountain.  At first, with good glasses, we could plainly see</p>
<p>Hooker&#x27;s troops driving the Confederates up the face of the mountain.</p>
<p>All were soon lost to view in the dense timber, but emerged again on</p>
<p>the open ground, across which the Confederates retreated at a lively</p>
<p>pace, followed by the pursuing line, which was led by a color-bearer,</p>
<p>who, far in advance, was bravely waving on his comrades.  The</p>
<p>gallantry of this man elicited much enthusiasm among us all, but as</p>
<p>he was a considerable distance ahead of his comrades I expected to</p>
<p>see his rashness punished at any moment by death or capture.  He</p>
<p>finally got quite near the retreating Confederates, when suddenly</p>
<p>they made a dash at him, but he was fully alive to such a move, and</p>
<p>ran back, apparently uninjured, to his friends.  About this time a</p>
<p>small squad of men reached the top of Lookout and planted the Stars</p>
<p>and Stripes on its very crest.  Just then a cloud settled down on the</p>
<p>mountain, and a heavy bank of fog obscured its whole face.</p>
<p>After the view was lost the sharp rattle of musketry continued some</p>
<p>time, but practically the fight had been already won by Hooker&#x27;s men,</p>
<p>the enemy only holding on with a rear-guard to assure his retreat</p>
<p>across Chattanooga Valley to Missionary Ridge.  Later we heard very</p>
<p>heavy cannonading, and fearing that Hooker was in trouble I sent a</p>
<p>staff-officer to find out whether he needed assistance, which I</p>
<p>thought could be given by a demonstration toward Rossville.  The</p>
<p>officer soon returned with the report that Hooker was all right, that</p>
<p>the cannonading was only a part of a little rear-guard fight, two</p>
<p>sections of artillery making all the noise, the reverberations from</p>
<p>point to point in the adjacent mountains echoing and reechoing till</p>
<p>it seemed that at least fifty guns were engaged.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th of November Bragg&#x27;s entire army was</p>
<p>holding only the line of Missionary Ridge, and our troops, being now</p>
<p>practically connected from Sherman to Hooker, confronted it with the</p>
<p>Army of the Cumberland in the centre--bowed out along the front of</p>
<p>Wood&#x27;s division and mine.  Early in the day Sherman, with great</p>
<p>determination and persistence, made an attempt to carry the high</p>
<p>ground near the tunnel, first gaining and then losing advantage, but</p>
<p>his attack was not crowned with the success anticipated.  Meanwhile</p>
<p>Hooker and Palmer were swinging across Chattanooga Valley, using me</p>
<p>as a pivot for the purpose of crossing Missionary Ridge in the</p>
<p>neighborhood of Rossville.  In the early part of the day I had driven</p>
<p>in the Confederate pickets in my front, so as to prolong my line of</p>
<p>battle on that of Wood, the necessity of continuing to refuse my</p>
<p>right having been obviated by the capture of Lookout Mountain and the</p>
<p>advance of Palmer.</p>
<p>About 2 o&#x27;clock orders came to carry the line at the foot of the</p>
<p>ridge, attacking at a signal of six guns.  I had few changes or new</p>
<p>dispositions to make.  Wagner&#x27;s brigade, which was next to Wood&#x27;s</p>
<p>division, was formed in double lines, and Harker&#x27;s brigade took the</p>
<p>same formation on Wagner&#x27;s right.  Colonel F. T. Sherman&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>came on Harker&#x27;s right, formed in a column of attack, with a front of</p>
<p>three regiments, he having nine.  My whole front was covered with a</p>
<p>heavy line of skirmishers.  These dispositions made, my right rested</p>
<p>a little distance south of Moore&#x27;s road, my left joined Wood over</p>
<p>toward Orchard Knob, while my centre was opposite Thurman&#x27;s house--</p>
<p>the headquarters of General Bragg--on Missionary Ridge.  A small</p>
<p>stream of water ran parallel to my front, as far as which the ground</p>
<p>was covered by a thin patch of timber, and beyond the edge of the</p>
<p>timber was an open plain to the foot of Missionary Ridge, varying in</p>
<p>width from four to nine hundred yards.  At the foot of the ridge was</p>
<p>the enemy&#x27;s first line of rifle-pits; at a point midway up its face,</p>
<p>another line, incomplete; and on the crest was a third line, in which</p>
<p>Bragg had massed his artillery.</p>
<p>The enemy saw we were making dispositions for an attack, and in plain</p>
<p>view of my whole division he prepared himself for resistance,</p>
<p>marching regiments from his left flank with flying colors; and</p>
<p>filling up the spaces not already occupied in his intrenchments.</p>
<p>Seeing the enemy thus strengthening himself, it was plain that we</p>
<p>would have to act quickly if we expected to accomplish much, and I</p>
<p>already began to doubt the feasibility of our remaining in the first</p>
<p>line of rifle-pits when we should have carried them.  I discussed the</p>
<p>order with Wagner, Harker, and Sherman, and they were similarly</p>
<p>impressed, so while anxiously awaiting the signal I sent Captain</p>
<p>Ransom of my staff to Granger, who was at Fort Wood, to ascertain if</p>
<p>we were to carry the first line or the ridge beyond.  Shortly after</p>
<p>Ransom started the signal guns were fired, and I told my brigade</p>
<p>commanders to go for the ridge.</p>
<p>Placing myself in front of Harker&#x27;s brigade, between the line of</p>
<p>battle and the skirmishers, accompanied by only an orderly so as not</p>
<p>to attract the enemy&#x27;s fire, we moved out.  Under a terrible storm of</p>
<p>shot and shell the line pressed forward steadily through the timber,</p>
<p>and as it emerged on the plain took the double-quick and with fixed</p>
<p>bayonets rushed at the enemy&#x27;s first line.  Not a shot was fired from</p>
<p>our line of battle, and as it gained on my skirmishers they melted</p>
<p>into and became one with it, and all three of my brigades went over</p>
<p>the rifle-pits simultaneously.  They then lay down on the face of the</p>
<p>ridge, for a breathing-spell and for protection&#x27; from the terrible</p>
<p>fire, of canister and musketry pouring over us from the guns on the</p>
<p>crest.  At the rifle-pits there had been little use for the bayonet,</p>
<p>for most of the Confederate troops, disconcerted by the sudden rush,</p>
<p>lay close in the ditch and surrendered, though some few fled up the</p>
<p>slope to the next line.  The prisoners were directed to move out to</p>
<p>our rear, and as their intrenchments had now come under fire from the</p>
<p>crest, they went with alacrity, and without guard or escort, toward</p>
<p>Chattanooga.</p>
<p>After a short pause to get breath the ascent of the ridge began, and</p>
<p>I rode, into the ditch of the intrenchments to drive out a few</p>
<p>skulkers who were hiding there.  Just at this time I was joined by</p>
<p>Captain Ransom, who, having returned from Granger, told me that we</p>
<p>were to carry only the line at the base, and that in coming back,</p>
<p>when he struck the left of the division, knowing this interpretation</p>
<p>of the order, he in his capacity as an aide-de-camp had directed</p>
<p>Wagner, who was up on the face of the ridge, to return, and that in</p>
<p>consequence Wagner was recalling his men to the base.  I could not</p>
<p>bear to order the recall of troops now so gallantly climbing the hill</p>
<p>step by step, and believing we could take it, I immediately rode to</p>
<p>Wagner&#x27;s brigade and directed it to resume the attack.  In the</p>
<p>meantime Harker&#x27;s and F. T. Sherman&#x27;s troops were approaching the</p>
<p>partial line of works midway of the ridge, and as I returned to the</p>
<p>centre of their rear, they were being led by many stands of</p>
<p>regimental colors.  There seemed to be a rivalry as to which color</p>
<p>should be farthest to the front; first one would go forward a few</p>
<p>feet, then another would come up to it, the color-bearers vying with</p>
<p>one another as to who should be foremost, until finally every</p>
<p>standard was planted on the intermediate works.  The enemy&#x27;s fire</p>
<p>from the crest during the ascent was terrific in the noise made, but</p>
<p>as it was plunging, it over-shot and had little effect on those above</p>
<p>the second line of pits, but was very uncomfortable for those below,</p>
<p>so I deemed it advisable to seek another place, and Wagner&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>having reassembled and again pressed up the ridge, I rode up the face</p>
<p>to join my troops.</p>
<p>As soon as the men saw me, they surged forward and went over the</p>
<p>works on the crest.  The parapet of the intrenchment was too high for</p>
<p>my horse to jump, so, riding a short distance to the left, I entered</p>
<p>through a low place in the line.  A few Confederates were found</p>
<p>inside, but they turned the butts of their muskets toward me in token</p>
<p>of surrender, for our men were now passing beyond them on both their</p>
<p>flanks.</p>
<p>The right and right centre of my division gained the summit first,</p>
<p>they being partially sheltered by a depression in the face of the</p>
<p>ridge, the Confederates in their immediate front fleeing down the</p>
<p>southern face.  When I crossed the rifle-pits on the top the</p>
<p>Confederates were still holding fast at Bragg&#x27;s headquarters, and a</p>
<p>battery located there opened fire along the crest; making things most</p>
<p>uncomfortably hot.  Seeing the danger to which I was exposed, for I</p>
<p>was mounted, Colonel Joseph Conrad, of the Fifteenth Missouri, ran up</p>
<p>and begged me to dismount.  I accepted his excellent advice, and it</p>
<p>probably saved my life; but poor Conrad was punished for his</p>
<p>solicitude by being seriously wounded in the thigh at the moment he</p>
<p>was thus contributing to my safety.</p>
<p>Wildly cheering, the men advanced along the ridge toward Bragg&#x27;s</p>
<p>headquarters, and soon drove the Confederates from this last</p>
<p>position, capturing a number of prisoners, among them Breckenridge&#x27;s</p>
<p>and Bates&#x27;s adjutant-generals, and the battery that had made such</p>
<p>stout resistance on the crest-two guns which were named &quot;Lady</p>
<p>Breckenridge&quot; and &quot;Lady Buckner&quot; General Bragg himself having barely</p>
<p>time to escape before his headquarters were taken.</p>
<p>My whole division had now reached the summit, and Wagner and Harker--</p>
<p>the latter slightly wounded--joined me as I was standing in the</p>
<p>battery just secured.  The enemy was rapidly retiring, and though</p>
<p>many of his troops, with disorganized wagon-trains and several pieces</p>
<p>of artillery, could be distinctly seen in much confusion about half a</p>
<p>mile distant in the valley below, yet he was covering them with a</p>
<p>pretty well organized line that continued to give us a desultory</p>
<p>fire.  Seeing this, I at once directed Wagner and Harker to take up</p>
<p>the pursuit along Moore&#x27;s road, which led to Chickamauga Station--</p>
<p>Bragg&#x27;s depot of supply--and as they progressed, I pushed Sherman&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade along the road behind them.  Wagner and Harker soon overtook</p>
<p>the rearguard, and a slight skirmish caused it to break, permitting</p>
<p>nine guns and a large number of wagons which were endeavoring to get</p>
<p>away in the stampede to fall into our hands.</p>
<p>About a mile and a half beyond Missionary Ridge, Moore&#x27;s road passed</p>
<p>over a second ridge or high range of hills, and here the enemy had</p>
<p>determined to make a stand for that purpose, posting eight pieces of</p>
<p>artillery with such supporting force as he could rally.  He was</p>
<p>immediately attacked by Harker and Wagner, but the position was</p>
<p>strong, the ridge being rugged and difficult of ascent, and after the</p>
<p>first onset our men recoiled.  A staff-officer from Colonel Wood&#x27;s</p>
<p>demi-brigade informing me at this juncture that that command was too</p>
<p>weak to carry the position in its front, I ordered the Fifteenth</p>
<p>Indiana and the Twenty-Sixth Ohio to advance to Wood&#x27;s aid, and then</p>
<p>hastening to the front I found his men clinging to the face of the</p>
<p>ridge, contending stubbornly with the rear-guard of the enemy.</p>
<p>Directing Harker to put Opdyke&#x27;s demi-brigade in on the right, I</p>
<p>informed Wagner that it was necessary to flank the enemy by carrying</p>
<p>the high bluff on our left where the ridge terminated, that I had</p>
<p>designated the Twenty-Sixth Ohio and Fifteenth Indiana for the work,</p>
<p>and that I wished him to join them.</p>
<p>It was now dusk, but the two regiments engaged in the flanking</p>
<p>movement pushed on to gain the bluff.  Just as they reached the crest</p>
<p>of the ridge the moon rose from behind, enlarged by the refraction of</p>
<p>the atmosphere, and as the attacking column passed along the summit</p>
<p>it crossed the moon&#x27;s disk and disclosed to us below a most</p>
<p>interesting panorama, every figure nearly being thrown out in full</p>
<p>relief.  The enemy, now outflanked on left and right, abandoned his</p>
<p>ground, leaving us two pieces of artillery and a number of wagons.</p>
<p>After this ridge was captured I found that no other troops than mine</p>
<p>were pursuing the enemy, so I called a halt lest I might become too</p>
<p>much isolated.  Having previously studied the topography of the</p>
<p>country thoroughly, I knew that if I pressed on my line of march</p>
<p>would carry me back to Chickamauga station, where we would be in rear</p>
<p>of the Confederates that had been fighting General Sherman, and that</p>
<p>there was a possibility of capturing them by such action; but I did</p>
<p>not feel warranted in marching there alone, so I rode back to</p>
<p>Missionary Ridge to ask for more troops, and upon arriving there I</p>
<p>found Granger in command, General Thomas having gone back to</p>
<p>Chattanooga.</p>
<p>Granger was at Braggy&#x27;s late headquarters in bed.  I informed him of</p>
<p>my situation and implored him to follow me up with the Army of the</p>
<p>Cumberland, but he declined, saying that he thought we had done well</p>
<p>enough.  I still insisting, he told me finally to push on to the</p>
<p>crossing of Chickamauga Creek, and if I, encountered the enemy he</p>
<p>would order troops to my support.  I returned to my division about</p>
<p>12 o&#x27;clock at night, got it under way, and reached the crossing,</p>
<p>about half a mile from the station, at 2 o&#x27;clock on the morning of</p>
<p>the 26th, and there found the bridge destroyed, but that the creek</p>
<p>was fordable.  I did not encounter the enemy in any force, but feared</p>
<p>to go farther without assistance.  This I thought I might bring up by</p>
<p>practicing a little deception, so I caused two regiments to simulate</p>
<p>an engagement by opening fire, hoping that this would alarm Granger</p>
<p>and oblige him to respond with troops, but my scheme failed.  General</p>
<p>Granger afterward told me that he had heard the volleys, but</p>
<p>suspected their purpose, knowing that they were not occasioned by a</p>
<p>fight, since they were too regular in their delivery.</p>
<p>I was much disappointed that my pursuit had not been supported, for I</p>
<p>felt that great results were in store for us should the enemy be</p>
<p>vigorously followed.  Had the troops under Granger&#x27;s command been</p>
<p>pushed out with mine when Missionary Ridge was gained, we could have</p>
<p>reached Chickamauga Station by 12 o&#x27;clock the night of the 25th; or</p>
<p>had they been sent even later, when I called for them, we could have</p>
<p>got there by daylight and worked incalculable danger to the</p>
<p>Confederates, for the force that had confronted Sherman did not pass</p>
<p>Chickamauga Station in their retreat till after daylight on the</p>
<p>morning of the 26th.</p>
<p>My course in following so close was dictated by a thorough knowledge</p>
<p>of the topography of the country and a familiarity with its roads,</p>
<p>bypaths, and farm-houses, gained with the assistance of Mr.</p>
<p>Crutchfield; and sure my column was heading in the right direction,</p>
<p>though night had fallen I thought that an active pursuit would almost</p>
<p>certainly complete the destruction of Bragg&#x27;s army.  When General</p>
<p>Grant came by my bivouac at the crossing of Chickamauga Creek on the</p>
<p>26th, he realized what might have been accomplished had the</p>
<p>successful assault on Missionary Ridge been supplemented by vigorous</p>
<p>efforts on the part of some high officers, who were more interested</p>
<p>in gleaning that portion of the battle-field over which my command</p>
<p>had passed than in destroying a panic-stricken enemy.</p>
<p>Although it cannot be said that the result of the two days&#x27;</p>
<p>operations was reached by the methods which General Grant had</p>
<p>indicated in his instructions preceding the battle, yet the general</p>
<p>outcome was unquestionably due to his genius, for the manoeuvring of</p>
<p>Sherman&#x27;s and Hooker&#x27;s commands created the opportunity for Thomas&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps of the Army of the Cumberland to carry the ridge at the centre.</p>
<p>In directing Sherman to attack the north end of the ridge, Grant</p>
<p>disconcerted Bragg--who was thus made to fear the loss of his depot</p>
<p>of supplies at Chickamauga Station--and compelled him to resist</p>
<p>stoutly; and stout resistance to Sherman meant the withdrawal of the</p>
<p>Confederates from Lookout Mountain.  While this attack was in process</p>
<p>of execution advantage was taken of it by Hooker in a well-planned</p>
<p>and well-fought battle, but to my mind an unnecessary one, for our</p>
<p>possession of Lookout was the inevitable result that must follow from</p>
<p>Sherman&#x27;s threatening attitude.  The assault on Missionary Ridge by</p>
<p>Granger&#x27;s and Palmer&#x27;s corps was not premeditated by Grant, he</p>
<p>directing only the line at its base to be carried, but when this fell</p>
<p>into our hands the situation demanded our getting the one at the top</p>
<p>also.</p>
<p>I took into the action an effective force of 6,000, and lost 123</p>
<p>officers and 1,181 men killed and wounded.  These casualties speak</p>
<p>louder than words of the character of the fight, and plainly tell</p>
<p>where the enemy struggled most stubbornly for these figures comprise</p>
<p>one-third the casualties of the entire body of Union troops--</p>
<p>Sherman&#x27;s and all included.  My division captured 1,762 prisoners</p>
<p>and, in all, seventeen pieces of artillery.  Six of these guns I</p>
<p>turned over with caissons complete; eleven were hauled off the field</p>
<p>and appropriated by an officer of high rank--General Hazen.  I have</p>
<p>no disposition to renew the controversy which grew out of this</p>
<p>matter.  At the time the occurrence took place I made the charge in a</p>
<p>plain official report, which was accepted as correct by the corps and</p>
<p>army commanders, from General Granger up to General Grant.  General</p>
<p>Hazen took no notice of this report then, though well aware of its</p>
<p>existence.  Nearly a quarter of a century later, however, he</p>
<p>endeavored to justify his retention of the guns by trying to show</p>
<p>that his brigade was the first to reach the crest of Missionary</p>
<p>Ridge, and that he was therefore entitled to them.  This claim of</p>
<p>being the first to mount the ridge is made by other brigades than</p>
<p>Hazen&#x27;s, with equal if not greater force, so the absurdity of his</p>
<p>deduction is apparent:</p>
<p>NOTE: In a book published by General Hazen in 1885, he endeavored to</p>
<p>show, by a number of letters from subordinate officers of his</p>
<p>command, written at his solicitation from fifteen to twenty years</p>
<p>after the occurrence, that his brigade was the first to mount</p>
<p>Missionary Ridge, and that it was entitled to possess these guns.</p>
<p>The doubtful character of testimony dimmed by the lapse of many years</p>
<p>has long been conceded, and I am content to let the controversy stand</p>
<p>the test of history, based on the conclusions of General Grant, as he</p>
<p>drew them from official reports made when the circumstances were</p>
<p>fresh in the minds of all.</p>
<p>General Grant says: &quot;To Sheridan&#x27;s prompt movement, the Army of the</p>
<p>Cumberland and the nation are indebted for the bulk of the capture of</p>
<p>prisoners, artillery, and small-arms that day.  Except for his prompt</p>
<p>pursuit, so much in this way would not have been accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>General Thomas says: &quot;We captured all their cannon and ammunition</p>
<p>before they could be removed or destroyed.  After halting a few</p>
<p>moments to reorganize the troops, who had become somewhat scattered</p>
<p>in the assault of the hill, General Sheridan pushed forward in</p>
<p>pursuit, and drove those in his front who had escaped capture across</p>
<p>Chickamauga Creek.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL FRANCIS T. SHERMAN, COMMANDING FIRST BRIGADE:</p>
<p>&quot;When within ten yards of the crest, our men seemed to be thrown</p>
<p>forward as if by some powerful engine, and the old flag was planted</p>
<p>firmly and surely on the last line of works of the enemy, followed by</p>
<p>the men, taking one battery of artillery.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL MICHAEL GOODING, TWENTY-SECOND INDIANA:</p>
<p>....&quot;I pushed men up to the second line of works as fast as possible;</p>
<p>on and on, clear to the top, and over the ridge they went, to the</p>
<p>hollow beyond, killing and wounding numbers of the enemy as we</p>
<p>advanced, and leaving the rebel battery in our rear.  We captured</p>
<p>great numbers of prisoners, and sent them to the rear without guards,</p>
<p>as we deemed the pursuit of the enemy of greater importance....</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot give too much praise to Captain Powers, Company &quot;H,&quot;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Smith, Company &quot;K,&quot; Lieutenant Gooding, Company &quot;A,&quot; and</p>
<p>Second Lieutenant Moser, Company &quot;G,&quot; for their assistance, and for</p>
<p>the gallant manner in which they encouraged their men up the side of</p>
<p>the mountain, and charging the enemy&#x27;s works right up to the muzzles</p>
<p>of their guns.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL JASON MARSH, SEVENTY-FOURTH ILLINOIS:</p>
<p>....&quot;The first on the enemy&#x27;s works, and almost simultaneously, were</p>
<p>Lieutenant Clement, Company &quot;A,&quot; Captain Stegner, Company &quot;I,&quot;</p>
<p>Captain Bacon, &quot;Company &quot;G,&quot; and Captain Leffingwell, with some of</p>
<p>their men.  The enemy was still in considerable force behind their</p>
<p>works; but, for some unaccountable reason, they either fled or</p>
<p>surrendered instantly upon the first few of our men reaching them--</p>
<p>not even trying to defend their battery, which was immediately</p>
<p>captured by Captain Stegner.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL PORTER C. OLSON, THIRTY-SIXTH ILLINOIS:</p>
<p>....&quot;In connection with other regiments of this brigade, we assisted</p>
<p>in capturing several pieces of artillery, a number of caissons, and a</p>
<p>great quantity of small-arms.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL JOHN Q. LANE:</p>
<p>....&quot;At the house known as Bragg&#x27;s headquarters, the enemy were</p>
<p>driven from three guns, which fell into our hands.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF BRIGADIER-GENERAL G. D. WAGNER, SECOND BRIGADE:</p>
<p>....&quot;I ordered the command to storm the ridge, bringing up the</p>
<p>Fifteenth Indiana and Ninety-seventh Ohio, which had not yet been</p>
<p>engaged, although suffering from the enemy&#x27;s artillery.  The result</p>
<p>is a matter of history, as we gained the ridge, capturing artillery,</p>
<p>prisoners, and small-arms; to what amount, however, I do not know, as</p>
<p>we pushed on after the enemy as soon as I had re-formed the command .</p>
<p>....Captain Tinney, with his usual gallantry, dashed up the line with</p>
<p>the first troops, and with the aid of an orderly (George Dusenbury,</p>
<p>Fifteenth Indiana), turned the loaded gun of the enemy on his</p>
<p>retreating ranks.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF CAPTAIN BENJAMIN F. HEGLER, FIFTEENTH INDIANA:</p>
<p>....&quot;Our captures amounted to prisoners not counted, representing</p>
<p>many different regiments; several pieces of artillery, and some</p>
<p>wagons.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL ELIAS NEFF, FORTIETH INDIANA:</p>
<p>....&quot;As the regiment reached the top of the ridge and swept for.</p>
<p>ward, the right passed through, without stopping to take possession,</p>
<p>the battery at General Bragg&#x27;s headquarters that had fired so</p>
<p>venomously during the whole contest.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL J. MOORE, FIFTY-EIGHTH INDIANA:</p>
<p>....&quot;In passing to the front from Missionary Ridge, we saw several</p>
<p>pieces of artillery which had been abandoned by the enemy, though I</p>
<p>did not leave any one in charge of them.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF MAJOR C, M. HAMMOND, ONE HUNDREDTH ILLINOIS:</p>
<p>....&quot;I immediately organized my regiment, and while so doing</p>
<p>discovered a number of pieces of artillery in a ravine on my left.  I</p>
<p>sent Lieutenant Stewart, of Company A, to see if these guns which the</p>
<p>enemy had abandoned could not be turned upon them.  He returned and</p>
<p>reported them to be four ten-pound Parrotts and two brass Napoleons;</p>
<p>also that it would require a number of men to place them in position.</p>
<p>I ordered him to report the same to General Wagner, and ask</p>
<p>permission, but before receiving a reply was ordered by you to move</p>
<p>forward my regiment on the left of the Fifty-Eighth Indiana</p>
<p>Volunteers.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL CHARLES G. HARKER, THIRD BRIGADE:</p>
<p>....&quot;My right and Colonel Sherman&#x27;s left interlocked, so to speak, as</p>
<p>we approached the summit, and it was near this point that I saw the</p>
<p>first part of my line gain the crest.  This was done by a few brave</p>
<p>men of my own and Colonel Sherman&#x27;s command driving the enemy from</p>
<p>his intrenchments.  The gap thus opened, our men rushed rapidly in,</p>
<p>and the enemy, loth to give up their position, still remained, firing</p>
<p>at my command toward the left, and the battery in front of the house</p>
<p>known as General Bragg&#x27;s headquarters was still firing at the troops,</p>
<p>and was captured by our men while the gunners were still at their</p>
<p>posts....</p>
<p>....&quot;We captured and sent to division and corps headquarters 503</p>
<p>prisoners and a large number of small-arms.  In regard to the number</p>
<p>of pieces of artillery, it will probably be difficult to reconcile</p>
<p>the reports of my regimental commanders with the reports of other</p>
<p>regiments and brigades who fought so nobly with my own command, and</p>
<p>who alike are entitled to share the honors and glories of the day.</p>
<p>More anxious to follow the enemy than to appropriate trophies already</p>
<p>secured, we pushed to the front, while the place we occupied on</p>
<p>ascending the hill was soon occupied by other troops, who, I have</p>
<p>learned, claim the artillery as having fallen into their own hands.</p>
<p>It must therefore remain with the division and corps commanders, who</p>
<p>knew the relative position of each brigade and division, to accord to</p>
<p>each the trophies to which they are due.</p>
<p>....&quot;From my personal observation I can claim a battery of six guns</p>
<p>captured by a portion of my brigade.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL EMERSON OPDYKE, FIRST DEMI-BRIGADE:</p>
<p>....&quot;My command captured Bragg&#x27;s headquarters, house, and the six</p>
<p>guns which were near there; one of these I ordered turned upon the</p>
<p>enemy, which was done with effect.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL H. C. DUNLAP, THIRD KENTUCKY:</p>
<p>....&quot;The point at which the centre of my regiment reached the crest</p>
<p>was at the stable to the left of the house said to be Bragg&#x27;s</p>
<p>headquarters, and immediately in front of the road which leads down</p>
<p>the southern slope of the ridge.  One piece of the abandoned battery,</p>
<p>was to the left of this point, the remainder to the right, near by.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL W. A. BULLITT, SIXTY-FIFTH OHIO:</p>
<p>....&quot;The position in which my regiment found itself was immediately</p>
<p>in front of a battery, which belched forth a stream of canister upon</p>
<p>us with terrible rapidity.  In addition to this, the enemy, whenever</p>
<p>driven from other points, rallied around this battery, and defended</p>
<p>it with desperation.  It cost a struggle to take it; but we finally</p>
<p>succeeded, and the colors of the Sixty-fifth Ohio were the first</p>
<p>planted upon the yet smoking guns.  Captain Smith, of my regiment,</p>
<p>was placed in charge of the captured battery, which consisted of 5</p>
<p>guns, 3 caissons, and 17 horses.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF CAPTAIN E. P. BATES, ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH OHIO:</p>
<p>....&quot;Perceiving that the ridge across which my regiment extended was</p>
<p>commanded to the very crest by a battery in front, also by those to</p>
<p>right and left, I directed the men to pass up the gorges on either</p>
<p>side.  About forty men, with Captain Parks and Lieutenant Stinger,</p>
<p>passed to the left, the balance to the right, and boldly charged on,</p>
<p>till, foremost with those of other regiments, they stood on the</p>
<p>strongest point of the enemy&#x27;s works, masters alike of his guns and</p>
<p>position....  Captain Parks reports his skirmish-line to have charged</p>
<p>upon and captured one gun, that otherwise would have been hauled</p>
<p>off.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL ALLEN BUCKNER, SEVENTY-NINTH ILLINOIS:</p>
<p>....&quot;The right of the regiment rested on the left of the road, where</p>
<p>it crossed the rebel fortification, leading up the hill toward</p>
<p>Bragg&#x27;s headquarters.  We took a right oblique direction through a</p>
<p>peach orchard until arriving at the woods and logs on the side of the</p>
<p>ridge, when I ordered the men to commence firing, which they did with</p>
<p>good effect, and continued it all the way up until the heights were</p>
<p>gained.  At this point the left of the regiment was near the right of</p>
<p>the house, and I claim that my officers and men captured two large</p>
<p>brass pieces, literally punching the cannoniers from their guns.</p>
<p>Privates John Fregan and Jasper Patterson, from Company &quot;A,&quot; rushed</p>
<p>down the hill, captured one caisson, with a cannonier and six horses,</p>
<p>and brought them back.&quot;</p>
<p>REPORT OF COLONEL J. R. MILES, TWENTY-SEVENTH ILLINOIS:</p>
<p>....&quot;The regiment, without faltering, finally, at about 4.30 P.M.,</p>
<p>gained the enemy&#x27;s works in conjunction with a party of the Thirty-</p>
<p>sixth Illinois, who were immediately on our right.  The regiment, or</p>
<p>a portion of it, proceeded to the left, down the ridge, for nearly or</p>
<p>quite a quarter of a mile capturing three or four pieces of cannon,</p>
<p>driving the gunners from them.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>
<p>ORDERED TO RETURN TO CHATTANOOGA--MARCH TO KNOXVILLE--COLLECTING</p>
<p>SUBSISTENCE STORES--A CLEVER STRATAGEM--A BRIDGE OF WAGONS--LOOKING</p>
<p>OUT FOR THE PERSONAL COMFORT OF THE SOLDIERS-A LEAVE OF ABSENCE--</p>
<p>ORDERED TO WASHINGTON--PARTING WITH SHERIDAN&#x27;S DIVISION.</p>
<p>The day after the battle of Missionary Ridge I was ordered in the</p>
<p>evening to return to Chattanooga, and from the limited supply of</p>
<p>stores to be had there outfit my command to march to the relief of</p>
<p>Knoxville, where General Burnside was still holding out against the</p>
<p>besieging forces of General Longstreet.  When we left Murfreesboro&#x27;</p>
<p>in the preceding June, the men&#x27;s knapsacks and extra clothing, as</p>
<p>well as all our camp equipage, had been left behind, and these</p>
<p>articles had not yet reached us, so we were poorly prepared for a</p>
<p>winter campaign in the mountains of East Tennessee.  There was but</p>
<p>little clothing to be obtained in Chattanooga, and my command</p>
<p>received only a few overcoats and a small supply of India-rubber</p>
<p>ponchos.  We could get no shoes, although we stood in great need of</p>
<p>them, for the extra pair with which each man had started out from</p>
<p>Murfreesboro&#x27; was now much the worse for wear.  The necessity for</p>
<p>succoring Knoxville was urgent, however, so we speedily refitted as</p>
<p>thoroughly as was possible with the limited means at hand.  My</p>
<p>division teams were in very fair condition in consequence of the</p>
<p>forage we had procured in the Sequatchie Valley, so I left the train</p>
<p>behind to bring up clothing when any should arrive in Chattanooga.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, on the 29th of November the Fourth Corps</p>
<p>(Granger&#x27;s) took up the line of march for Knoxville, my men carrying</p>
<p>in their haversacks four days&#x27; rations, depending for a further</p>
<p>supply of food on a small steamboat loaded with subsistence stores,</p>
<p>which was to proceed up the Tennessee River and keep abreast of the</p>
<p>column.</p>
<p>Not far from Philadelphia, Tennessee, the columns of General</p>
<p>Sherman&#x27;s army, which had kept a greater distance from the river than</p>
<p>Granger&#x27;s corps, so as to be able to subsist on the country, came in</p>
<p>toward our right and the whole relieving force was directed on</p>
<p>Marysville, about fifteen miles southwest of Knoxville.  We got to</p>
<p>Marysville December 5, and learned the same day that Longstreet had</p>
<p>shortly before attempted to take Knoxville by a desperate assault,</p>
<p>but signally failing, had raised the siege and retired toward Bean&#x27;s</p>
<p>Station on the Rutledge, Rogersville, and Bristol road, leading to</p>
<p>Virginia.  From Marysville General Sherman&#x27;s troops returned to</p>
<p>Chattanooga, while Granger&#x27;s corps continued on toward Knoxville, to</p>
<p>take part in the pursuit of Longstreet.</p>
<p>Burnside&#x27;s army was deficient in subsistence, though not to the</p>
<p>extent that we had supposed before leaving Chattanooga.  It had eaten</p>
<p>out the country in the immediate vicinity of Knoxville, however;</p>
<p>therefore my division did not cross the Holstein River, but was</p>
<p>required, in order to maintain itself, to proceed to the region of</p>
<p>the French Broad River.  To this end I moved to Sevierville, and</p>
<p>making this village my headquarters, the division was spread out over</p>
<p>the French Broad country, between Big Pigeon and Little Pigeon</p>
<p>rivers, where we soon had all the mills in operation, grinding out</p>
<p>plenty of flour and meal.  The whole region was rich in provender of</p>
<p>all kinds, and as the people with rare exceptions were</p>
<p>enthusiastically loyal, we in a little while got more than enough</p>
<p>food for ourselves, and by means of flatboats began sending the</p>
<p>surplus down the river to the troops at Knoxville.</p>
<p>The intense loyalty of this part of Tennessee exceeded that of any</p>
<p>other section I was in during the war.  The people could not do too</p>
<p>much to aid the Union cause, and brought us an abundance of</p>
<p>everything needful.  The women were especially loyal, and as many of</p>
<p>their sons and husbands, who had been compelled to &quot;refugee&quot; on</p>
<p>account of their loyal sentiments, returned with us, numbers of the</p>
<p>women went into ecstasies of joy when this part of the Union army</p>
<p>appeared among them.  So long as we remained in the French Broad</p>
<p>region, we lived on the fat of the land, but unluckily our stay was</p>
<p>to be of short duration, for Longstreet&#x27;s activity kept the</p>
<p>department commander in a state of constant alarm.</p>
<p>Soon after getting the mills well running, and when the shipment of</p>
<p>their surplus product down the river by flatboats had begun, I was</p>
<p>ordered to move to Knoxville, on account of demonstrations by</p>
<p>Longstreet from the direction of Blain&#x27;s crossroads.  On arriving at</p>
<p>Knoxville, an inspection of my command, showed that the shoes of many</p>
<p>of the men were entirely worn out, the poor fellows having been</p>
<p>obliged to protect their feet with a sort of moccasin, made from</p>
<p>their blankets or from such other material as they could procure.</p>
<p>About six hundred of the command were in this condition, plainly not</p>
<p>suitably shod to withstand the frequent storms of sleet and snow.</p>
<p>These men I left in Knoxville to await the arrival of my train, which</p>
<p>I now learned was en route from Chattanooga with shoes, overcoats,</p>
<p>and other clothing, and with the rest of the division proceeded to</p>
<p>Strawberry Plains, which we reached the latter part of December.</p>
<p>Mid-winter was now upon us, and the weather in this mountain region</p>
<p>of East Tennessee was very cold, snow often falling to the depth of</p>
<p>several inches.  The thin and scanty clothing of the men afforded</p>
<p>little protection, and while in bivouac their only shelter was the</p>
<p>ponchos with which they had been provided before leaving Chattanooga;</p>
<p>there was not a tent in the command.  Hence great suffering resulted,</p>
<p>which I anxiously hoped would be relieved shortly by the arrival of</p>
<p>my train with supplies.  In the course of time the wagons reached</p>
<p>Knoxville, but my troops derived little comfort from this fact, for</p>
<p>the train was stopped by General Foster, who had succeeded Burnside</p>
<p>in command of the department, its contents distributed pro rata to</p>
<p>the different organizations of the entire army, and I received but a</p>
<p>small share.  This was very disappointing, not to say exasperating,</p>
<p>but I could not complain of unfairness, for every command in the army</p>
<p>was suffering to the same extent as mine, and yet it did seem that a</p>
<p>little forethought and exertion on the part of some of the other</p>
<p>superior officers, whose transportation was in tolerable condition,</p>
<p>might have ameliorated the situation considerably.  I sent the train</p>
<p>back at once for more clothing, and on its return, just before</p>
<p>reaching Knoxville, the quartermaster in charge, Captain Philip</p>
<p>Smith, filled the open spaces in the wagons between the bows and load</p>
<p>with fodder and hay, and by this clever stratagem passed it through</p>
<p>the town safe and undisturbed as a forage train.  On Smith&#x27;s arrival</p>
<p>we lost no time in issuing the clothing, and when it had passed into</p>
<p>the hands of the individual soldiers the danger of its appropriation</p>
<p>for general distribution, like the preceding invoice, was very</p>
<p>remote.</p>
<p>General Foster had decided by this time to move his troops to</p>
<p>Dandridge for the twofold purpose of threatening the enemy&#x27;s left and</p>
<p>of getting into a locality where we could again gather subsistence</p>
<p>from the French Broad region.  Accordingly we began an advance on the</p>
<p>15th of January, the cavalry having preceded us some time before.</p>
<p>The Twenty-third Corps and Wood&#x27;s division of the Fourth Corps</p>
<p>crossed the Holstein River by a bridge that had been constructed at</p>
<p>Strawberry Plains.  My division being higher up the stream, forded</p>
<p>it, the water very deep and bitter cold, being filled with slushy</p>
<p>ice.  Marching by way of New Market, I reached Dandridge on the 17th,</p>
<p>and here on my arrival met General Sturgis, then commanding our</p>
<p>cavalry.  He was on the eve of setting out to, &quot;whip the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry,&quot; as he said, and wanted me to go along and see him do it.  I</p>
<p>declined, however, for being now the senior officer present, Foster,</p>
<p>Parke, and Granger having remained at Knoxville and Strawberry</p>
<p>Plains, their absence left me in command, and it was necessary that I</p>
<p>should make disposition of the infantry when it arrived.  As there</p>
<p>were indications of a considerable force of the enemy on the</p>
<p>Russellville road I decided to place the troops in line of battle, so</p>
<p>as to be prepared for any emergency that might arise in the absence</p>
<p>of the senior officers, and I deemed it prudent to supervise</p>
<p>personally the encamping of the men.  This disposition necessarily</p>
<p>required that some of the organizations should occupy very</p>
<p>disagreeable ground, but I soon got all satisfactorily posted with</p>
<p>the exception of General Willich, who expressed some discontent at</p>
<p>being placed beyond the shelter of the timber, but accepted the</p>
<p>situation cheerfully when its obvious necessity was pointed out to</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Feeling that all was secure, I returned to my headquarters in the</p>
<p>village with the idea that we were safely established in ease of</p>
<p>attack, and that the men would now have a good rest if left</p>
<p>undisturbed; and plenty to eat, but hardly had I reached my own camp</p>
<p>when a staff-officer came post-haste from Sturgis with the</p>
<p>information that he was being driven back to my lines, despite the</p>
<p>confident invitation to me (in the morning) to go out and witness the</p>
<p>whipping which was to be given to the enemy&#x27;s cavalry.  Riding to the</p>
<p>front, I readily perceived that the information was correct, and I</p>
<p>had to send a brigade of infantry out to help Sturgis, thus relieving</p>
<p>him from a rather serious predicament.  Indeed, the enemy was present</p>
<p>in pretty strong force, both cavalry and infantry, and from his</p>
<p>vicious attack on Sturgis it looked very much as though he intended</p>
<p>to bring on a general engagement.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances I deemed it advisable that the responsible</p>
<p>commanders of the army should be present, and so informed them.  My</p>
<p>communication brought Parke and Granger to the front without delay,</p>
<p>but Foster could not come, since the hardships of the winter had</p>
<p>reopened an old wound received during the Mexican War, and brought on</p>
<p>much suffering.  By the time Parke and Granger arrived, however, the</p>
<p>enemy, who it turned out was only making a strong demonstration to</p>
<p>learn the object of our movement on Dandridge, seemed satisfied with</p>
<p>the results of his reconnoissance, and began falling back toward</p>
<p>Bull&#x27;s Gap.  Meanwhile Parke and Granger concluded that Dandridge was</p>
<p>an untenable point, and hence decided to withdraw a part of the army</p>
<p>to Strawberry Plains; and the question of supplies again coming up,</p>
<p>it was determined to send the Fourth Corps to the south side of the</p>
<p>French Broad to obtain subsistence, provided we could bridge the</p>
<p>river so that men could get across the deep and icy stream without</p>
<p>suffering.</p>
<p>I agreed to undertake the construction of a bridge on condition that</p>
<p>each division should send to the ford twenty-five wagons with which</p>
<p>to make it.  This being acceded to, Harker&#x27;s brigade began the work</p>
<p>next morning at a favorable point a few miles down the river.  As my</p>
<p>quota of wagons arrived, they were drawn into the stream one after</p>
<p>another by the wheel team, six men in each wagon, and as they</p>
<p>successively reachÔøΩÔøΩd the other side of the channel the mules were</p>
<p>unhitched, the pole of each wagon run under thre hind axle of the one</p>
<p>just in front, and the tailboards used so as to span the slight space</p>
<p>between them.  The plan worked well as long as the material lasted,</p>
<p>but no other wagons than my twenty-five coming on the ground, the</p>
<p>work stopped when the bridge was only half constructed.  Informed of</p>
<p>the delay and its cause, in sheer desperation I finished the bridge</p>
<p>by taking from my own division all the wagons needed to make up the</p>
<p>deficiency.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when the work was finished, and I began</p>
<p>putting over one of my brigades; but in the midst of its crossing</p>
<p>word came that Longstreet&#x27;s army was moving to attack us, which</p>
<p>caused an abandonment of the foraging project, and orders quickly</p>
<p>followed to retire to Strawberry Plains, the retrograde movement to</p>
<p>begin forthwith.  I sent to headquarters information of the plight I</p>
<p>was in--baggage and supplies on the bank and wagons in the stream--</p>
<p>begged to know what was to become of them if we were to hurry off at</p>
<p>a moment&#x27;s notice, and suggested that the movement be delayed until I</p>
<p>could recover my transportation.  Receiving in reply no assurances</p>
<p>that I should be relieved from my dilemma--and, in fact, nothing</p>
<p>satisfactory--I determined to take upon myself the responsibility of</p>
<p>remaining on the ground long enough to get my wagons out of the</p>
<p>river; so I sent out a heavy force to watch for the enemy, and with</p>
<p>the remainder of the command went to work to break up the bridge.</p>
<p>Before daylight next morning I had recovered everything without</p>
<p>interference by Longstreet, who, it was afterward ascertained, was</p>
<p>preparing to move east toward Lynchburg instead of marching to attack</p>
<p>us; the small demonstration against Dandridge, being made simply to</p>
<p>deceive us as to his ultimate object.  I marched to Strawberry Plains</p>
<p>unmolested, and by taking the route over Bay&#x27;s Mountain, a shorter</p>
<p>one than that followed by the main body of our troops, reached the</p>
<p>point of rendezvous as soon as the most of the army, for the road it</p>
<p>followed was not only longer, but badly cut up by trains that had</p>
<p>recently passed over it.</p>
<p>Shortly after getting into camp, the beef contractor came in and</p>
<p>reported that a detachment of the enemy&#x27;s cavalry had captured my</p>
<p>herd of beef cattle.  This caused me much chagrin at first, but the</p>
<p>commissary of my division soon put in an appearance, and assured me</p>
<p>that the loss would not be very disastrous to us nor of much benefit</p>
<p>to the enemy, since the cattle were so poor and weak that they could</p>
<p>not be driven off.  A reconnoissance in force verified the</p>
<p>Commissary&#x27;s statement.  From its inability to travel, the herd,</p>
<p>after all efforts to carry it off had proved ineffectual, had been</p>
<p>abandoned by its captors.</p>
<p>After the troops from Chattanooga arrived in the vicinity of</p>
<p>Knoxville and General Sherman had returned to Chattanooga, the</p>
<p>operations in East Tennessee constituted a series of blunders,</p>
<p>lasting through the entire winter; a state of affairs doubtless due,</p>
<p>in the main, to the fact that the command of the troops was so</p>
<p>frequently changed.  Constant shifting of responsibility from one to</p>
<p>another ensued from the date that General Sherman, after assuring</p>
<p>himself that Knoxville was safe, devolved the command on Burnside.</p>
<p>It had already been intimated to Burnside that he was to be relieved,</p>
<p>and in consequence he was inactive and apathetic, confining his</p>
<p>operations to an aimless expedition whose advance extended only as</p>
<p>far as Blain&#x27;s crossroads, whence it was soon withdrawn.  Meanwhile</p>
<p>General Foster had superseded Burnside, but physical disabilities</p>
<p>rendered him incapable of remaining in the field, and then the chief</p>
<p>authority devolved on Parke.  By this time the transmission of power</p>
<p>seemed almost a disease; at any rate it was catching, so, while we</p>
<p>were en route to Dandridge, Parke transferred the command to Granger.</p>
<p>The latter next unloaded it on me, and there is no telling what the</p>
<p>final outcome would have been had I not entered a protest against a</p>
<p>further continuance of the practice, which remonstrance brought</p>
<p>Granger to the front at Dandridge.</p>
<p>While the events just narrated were taking place, General Grant had</p>
<p>made a visit to Knoxville--about the last of December--and arranged</p>
<p>to open the railroad between there and Chattanooga, with a view to</p>
<p>supplying the troops in East Tennessee by rail in the future, instead</p>
<p>of through Cumberland Gap by a tedious line of wagon-trains.  In</p>
<p>pursuance of his plan the railroad had already been opened to Loudon,</p>
<p>but here much delay occurred on account of the long time it took to</p>
<p>rebuild the bridge over the Tennessee.  Therefore supplies were still</p>
<p>very scarce, and as our animals were now dying in numbers from</p>
<p>starvation, and the men were still on short allowance, it became</p>
<p>necessary that some of the troops east of Knoxville should get nearer</p>
<p>to their depot, and also be in a position to take part in the coming</p>
<p>Georgia campaign, or render assistance to General Thomas, should</p>
<p>General Johnston (who had succeeded in command of the Confederate</p>
<p>army) make any demonstration against Chattanooga.  Hence my division</p>
<p>was ordered to take station at Loudon, Tennessee, and I must confess</p>
<p>that we took the road for that point with few regrets, for a general</p>
<p>disgust prevailed regarding our useless marches during the winter.</p>
<p>At this time my faithful scout Card and his younger brother left me,</p>
<p>with the determination, as I have heretofore related, to avenge their</p>
<p>brother&#x27;s death.  No persuasion could induce Card to remain longer,</p>
<p>for knowing that my division&#x27;s next operation would be toward</p>
<p>Atlanta, and being ignorant of the country below Dalton,.  he</p>
<p>recognized and insisted that his services would then become</p>
<p>practically valueless.</p>
<p>At Loudon, where we arrived January 27, supplies were more plentiful,</p>
<p>and as our tents and extra clothing reached us there in a few days,</p>
<p>every one grew contented and happy.  Here a number of my regiments,</p>
<p>whose terms of service were about to expire, went through the process</p>
<p>of &quot;veteranizing,&quot; and, notwithstanding the trials and hardships of</p>
<p>the preceding nine months, they re-enlisted almost to a man.</p>
<p>When everything was set in motion toward recuperating and refitting</p>
<p>my troops, I availed myself of the opportunity during a lull that</p>
<p>then existed to take a short leave of absence--a privilege I had not</p>
<p>indulged in since entering the service in 1853.  This leave I spent</p>
<p>in the North with much benefit to my physical condition, for I was</p>
<p>much run down by fatiguing service, and not a little troubled by</p>
<p>intense pain which I at times still suffered from my experience in</p>
<p>the unfortunate hand-car incident on the Cumberland Mountains the</p>
<p>previous July.  I returned from leave the latter part of March,</p>
<p>rejoining my division with the expectation that the campaign in that</p>
<p>section would begin as early as April.</p>
<p>On the 12th of March, 1864, General Grant was assigned to the command</p>
<p>of the armies of the United States, as general-in-chief.  He was</p>
<p>already in Washington, whither he had gone to receive his commission</p>
<p>as lieutenant-general.  Shortly after his arrival there, he commenced</p>
<p>to rearrange the different commands in the army to suit the plans</p>
<p>which he intended to enter upon in the spring, and out of this grew a</p>
<p>change in my career.  Many jealousies and much ill-feeling, the</p>
<p>outgrowth of former campaigns, existed among officers of high grade</p>
<p>in the Army of the Potomac in the winter of 1864, and several general</p>
<p>officers were to be sent elsewhere in consequence.  Among these,</p>
<p>General Alfred Pleasonton was to be relieved from the command of the</p>
<p>cavalry, General Grant having expressed to the President</p>
<p>dissatisfaction that so little had hitherto been accomplished by that</p>
<p>arm of the service, and I was selected as chief of the cavalry corps</p>
<p>of the Army of the Potomac, receiving on the night of the 23d of</p>
<p>March from General Thomas at Chattanooga the following telegram:</p>
<p>&quot;MARCH 23, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS, Chattanooga</p>
<p>&quot;Lieutenant-General Grant directs that Major-General Sheridan</p>
<p>immediately repair to Washington and report to the Adjutant-General</p>
<p>of the Army.</p>
<p>&quot; H. W. HALLECK,</p>
<p>Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.&quot;</p>
<p>I was not informed of the purpose for which I was to proceed to</p>
<p>Washington, but I conjectured that it meant a severing of my</p>
<p>relations with the Second Division, Fourth Army Corps.  I at once set</p>
<p>about obeying the order, and as but little preparation was necessary,</p>
<p>I started for Chattanooga the next day, without taking any formal</p>
<p>leave of the troops I had so long commanded.  I could not do it; the</p>
<p>bond existing between them and me had grown to such depth of</p>
<p>attachment that I feared to trust my emotions in any formal parting</p>
<p>from a body of soldiers who, from our mutual devotion, had long</p>
<p>before lost their official designation, and by general consent within</p>
<p>and without the command were called &quot;Sheridan&#x27;s Division.&quot;  When I</p>
<p>took the train at the station the whole command was collected on the</p>
<p>hill-sides around to see me off.  They had assembled spontaneously,</p>
<p>officers and men, and as the cars moved out for Chattanooga they</p>
<p>waved me farewell with demonstrations of affection.</p>
<p>A parting from such friends was indeed to be regretted.  They had</p>
<p>never given me any trouble, nor done anything that could bring aught</p>
<p>but honor to themselves.  I had confidence in them, and I believe</p>
<p>they had in me.  They were ever steady, whether in victory or in</p>
<p>misfortune, and as I tried always to be with them, to put them into</p>
<p>the hottest fire if good could be gained, or save them from</p>
<p>unnecessary loss, as occasion required, they amply repaid all my care</p>
<p>and anxiety, courageously and readily meeting all demands in every</p>
<p>emergency that arose.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, nearly two years before, my lot had been cast with about</p>
<p>half of the twenty-five regiments of infantry that I was just</p>
<p>leaving, the rest joining me after Chickamauga.  It was practically a</p>
<p>new arm of the service to me, for although I was an infantry officer,</p>
<p>yet the only large command which up to that time I had controlled was</p>
<p>composed of cavalry, and most of my experience had been gained in</p>
<p>this arm of the service.  I had to study hard to be able to master</p>
<p>all the needs of such a force, to feed and clothe it and guard all</p>
<p>its interests.  When undertaking these responsibilities I felt that</p>
<p>if I met them faithfully, recompense would surely come through the</p>
<p>hearty response that soldiers always make to conscientious exertion</p>
<p>on the part of their superiors, and not only that more could be</p>
<p>gained in that way than from the use of any species of influence, but</p>
<p>that the reward would be quicker.  Therefore I always tried to look</p>
<p>after their comfort personally; selected their camps, and provided</p>
<p>abundantly for their subsistence, and the road they opened for me</p>
<p>shows that my work was not in vain.  I regretted deeply to have to</p>
<p>leave such soldiers, and felt that they were sorry I was going, and</p>
<p>even now I could not, if I would, retain other than the warmest</p>
<p>sentiments of esteem and the tenderest affection for the officers and</p>
<p>men of &quot;Sheridan&#x27;s Division,&quot; Army of the Cumberland.</p>
<p>On reaching Chattanooga I learned from General Thomas the purpose for</p>
<p>which I had been ordered to Washington.  I was to be assigned to the</p>
<p>command of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac.  The</p>
<p>information staggered me at first, for I knew well the great</p>
<p>responsibilities of such a position; moreover, I was but slightly</p>
<p>acquainted with military operations in Virginia, and then, too, the</p>
<p>higher officers of the Army of the Potomac were little known to me,</p>
<p>so at the moment I felt loth to undergo the trials of the new</p>
<p>position.  Indeed, I knew not a soul in Washington except General</p>
<p>Grant and General Halleck, and them but slightly, and no one in</p>
<p>General Meade&#x27;s army, from the commanding general down, except a few</p>
<p>officers in the lower grades, hardly any of whom I had seen since</p>
<p>graduating at the Military Academy.</p>
<p>Thus it is not much to be wondered at that General Thomas&#x27;s</p>
<p>communication momentarily upset me.  But there was no help for it, so</p>
<p>after reflecting on the matter a little I concluded to make the best</p>
<p>of the situation.  As in Virginia I should be operating in a field</p>
<p>with which I was wholly unfamiliar, and among so many who were</p>
<p>strangers, it seemed to me that it would be advisable to have, as a</p>
<p>chief staff-officer, one who had had service in the East, if an</p>
<p>available man could be found.  In weighing all these considerations</p>
<p>in my mind, I fixed upon Captain James W. Forsyth, of the Eighteenth</p>
<p>Infantry, then in the regular brigade at Chattanooga--a dear friend</p>
<p>of mine, who had served in the Army of the Potomac, in the Peninsula</p>
<p>and Antietam campaigns.  He at once expressed a desire to accept a</p>
<p>position on my staff, and having obtained by the next day the</p>
<p>necessary authority, he and I started for Washington, accompanied by</p>
<p>Lieutenant T. W. C. Moore, one of my aides, leaving behind Lieutenant</p>
<p>M. V. Sheridan, my other aide, to forward our horses as soon as they</p>
<p>should be sent down to Chattanooga from Loudon, after which he was to</p>
<p>join me.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
<p>AT WASHINGTON--MEETING SECRETARY STANTON--INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT</p>
<p>LINCOLN--MADE COMMANDER OF THE CAVALRY CORPS OF THE ARMY OF THE</p>
<p>POTOMAC--ITS OFFICERS--GENERAL MEADE&#x27;s METHOD OF USING CAVALRY--</p>
<p>OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN--SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H.--A DIFFERENCE WITH</p>
<p>GENERAL MEADE--PREPARING TO FIGHT STUART&#x27;S CAVALRY.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Captain Forsyth and Lieutenant Moore, I arrived in</p>
<p>Washington on the morning of April, 4, 1864, and stopped at Willard&#x27;s</p>
<p>Hotel, where, staying temporarily, were many officers of the Army of</p>
<p>the Potomac en route to their commands from leave at the North.</p>
<p>Among all these, however, I was an entire stranger, and I cannot now</p>
<p>recall that I met a single individual whom I had ever before known.</p>
<p>With very little delay after reaching my hotel I made my way to</p>
<p>General Halleck&#x27;s headquarters and reported to that officer, having</p>
<p>learned in the meantime that General Grant was absent from the city.</p>
<p>General Halleck talked to me for a few minutes, outlining briefly the</p>
<p>nature and duties of my new command, and the general military</p>
<p>situation in Virginia.  When he had finished all he had to say about</p>
<p>these matters, he took me to the office of the Secretary of War, to</p>
<p>present me to Mr. Stanton.  During the ceremony of introduction, I</p>
<p>could feel that Mr. Stanton was eying me closely and searchingly,</p>
<p>endeavoring to form some estimate of one about whom he knew</p>
<p>absolutely nothing, and whose career probably had never been called</p>
<p>to his attention until General Grant decided to order me East, after</p>
<p>my name had been suggested by General Halleck in an interview the two</p>
<p>generals had with Mr. Lincoln.  I was rather young in appearance--</p>
<p>looking even under than over thirty-three years--but five feet five</p>
<p>inches in height, and thin almost to emaciation, weighing only one</p>
<p>hundred and fifteen pounds.  If I had ever possessed any self-</p>
<p>assertion in manner or speech, it certainly vanished in the presence</p>
<p>of the imperious Secretary, whose name at the time was the synonym of</p>
<p>all that was cold and formal.  I never learned what Mr. Stanton&#x27;s</p>
<p>first impressions of me were, and his guarded and rather calculating</p>
<p>manner gave at this time no intimation that they were either</p>
<p>favorable or unfavorable, but his frequent commendation in after</p>
<p>years indicated that I gained his goodwill before the close of the</p>
<p>war, if not when I first came to his notice; and a more intimate</p>
<p>association convinced me that the cold and cruel characteristics</p>
<p>popularly ascribed to him were more mythical than real.</p>
<p>When the interview with the Secretary was over, I proceeded with</p>
<p>General Halleck to the White House to pay my respects to the</p>
<p>President.  Mr. Lincoln received me very cordially, offering both his</p>
<p>hands, and saying that he hoped I would fulfill the expectations of</p>
<p>General Grant in the new command I was about to undertake, adding</p>
<p>that thus far the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac had not done all</p>
<p>it might have done, and wound up our short conversation by quoting</p>
<p>that stale interrogation so prevalent during the early years of the</p>
<p>war, &quot;Who ever saw a dead cavalryman?&quot;  His manner did not impress</p>
<p>me, however, that in asking the question he had meant anything beyond</p>
<p>a jest, and I parted from the President convinced that he did not</p>
<p>believe all that the query implied.</p>
<p>After taking leave I separated from General Halleck, and on returning</p>
<p>to my hotel found there an order from the War Department assigning me</p>
<p>to the command of the Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac.  The next</p>
<p>morning, April 5, as I took the cars for the headquarters of the Army</p>
<p>of the Potomac, General Grant, who had returned to Washington the</p>
<p>previous night from a visit to his family, came aboard the train on</p>
<p>his way to Culpeper Court House, and on the journey down I learned</p>
<p>among other things that he had wisely determined to continue</p>
<p>personally in the field, associating himself with General Meade&#x27;s</p>
<p>army; where he could supervise its movements directly, and at the</p>
<p>same time escape the annoyances which, should he remain in</p>
<p>Washington, would surely arise from solicitude for the safety of the</p>
<p>Capital while the campaign was in progress.  When we reached Brandy</p>
<p>Station, I left the train and reported to General Meade, who told me</p>
<p>that the headquarters of the Cavalry Corps were some distance back</p>
<p>from the Station, and indicated the general locations of the</p>
<p>different divisions of the corps, also giving me, in the short time I</p>
<p>remained with him, much information regarding their composition.</p>
<p>I reached the Cavalry Corps headquarters on the evening of April 5,</p>
<p>1864, and the next morning issued orders assuming command.  General</p>
<p>Pleasonton had but recently been relieved, and many of his staff-</p>
<p>officers were still on duty at the headquarters awaiting the arrival</p>
<p>of the permanent commander.  I resolved to retain the most of these</p>
<p>officers on my staff, and although they were all unknown to me when I</p>
<p>decided on this course, yet I never had reason to regret it, nor to</p>
<p>question the selections made by my predecessor.</p>
<p>The corps consisted of three cavalry divisions and twelve batteries</p>
<p>of horse artillery.  Brigadier-General A. T. A. Torbert was in</p>
<p>command of the First Division, which was composed of three brigades;</p>
<p>Brigadier-General D. McM. Gregg, of the Second, consisting of two</p>
<p>brigades; and Brigadier-General J. H. Wilson was afterward assigned</p>
<p>to command the Third, also comprising two brigades: Captain Robinson,</p>
<p>a veteran soldier of the Mexican war, was chief of artillery, and as</p>
<p>such had a general supervision of that arm, though the batteries,</p>
<p>either as units or in sections, were assigned to the different</p>
<p>divisions in campaign.</p>
<p>Each one of my division commanders was a soldier by profession.</p>
<p>Torbert graduated from the Military Academy in 1855, and was</p>
<p>commissioned in the infantry, in which arm he saw much service on the</p>
<p>frontier, in Florida, and on the Utah expedition.  At the beginning</p>
<p>of hostilities in April, 1861, he was made a colonel of New Jersey</p>
<p>volunteers, and from that position was promoted in the fall of 1862</p>
<p>to be a brigadier-general, thereafter commanding a brigade of</p>
<p>infantry in the Army of the Potomac till, in the redistribution of</p>
<p>generals, after Grant came to the East, he was assigned to the First</p>
<p>Cavalry Division.</p>
<p>Gregg graduated in 1855 also, and was appointed to the First</p>
<p>Dragoons, with which regiment, up to the breaking out of the war, he</p>
<p>saw frontier service extending from Fort Union, New Mexico, through</p>
<p>to the Pacific coast, and up into Oregon and Washington Territories,</p>
<p>where I knew him slightly.  In the fall of 1861 he became colonel of</p>
<p>the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and a year later was made a</p>
<p>brigadier-general.  He then succeeded to the command of a division of</p>
<p>cavalry, and continued in that position till the close of his</p>
<p>service, at times temporarily commanding the Cavalry Corps.  He was</p>
<p>the only division commander I had whose experience had been almost</p>
<p>exclusively derived from the cavalry arm.</p>
<p>Wilson graduated in 1860 in the Topographical Engineers, and was</p>
<p>first assigned to duty in Oregon, where he remained till July, 1861.</p>
<p>In the fall of that year his active service in the war began, and he</p>
<p>rose from one position to another, in the East and West, till, while</p>
<p>on General Grant&#x27;s staff, he was made a brigadier-general in the fall</p>
<p>of 1863 in reward for services performed during the Vicksburg</p>
<p>campaign and for engineer duty at Chattanooga preceding the battle of</p>
<p>Missionary Ridge.  At my request he was selected to command the Third</p>
<p>Division.  General Grant thought highly of him, and, expecting much</p>
<p>from his active mental and physical ability, readily assented to</p>
<p>assign him in place of General Kilpatrick.  The only other general</p>
<p>officers in the corps were Brigadier-General Wesley Merritt,</p>
<p>Brigadier-General George A. Custer, and Brigadier-General Henry E.</p>
<p>Davies, each commanding a brigade.</p>
<p>In a few days after my arrival at Brandy Station I reviewed my new</p>
<p>command, which consisted of about twelve thousand officers and men,</p>
<p>with the same number of horses in passable trim.  Many of the general</p>
<p>officers of the army were present at the review, among them Generals</p>
<p>Meade, Hancock, and Sedgwick.  Sedgwick being an old dragoon, came to</p>
<p>renew his former associations with mounted troops, and to encourage</p>
<p>me, as he jestingly said, because of the traditional prejudices the</p>
<p>cavalrymen were supposed to hold against being commanded by an</p>
<p>infantry officer.  The corps presented a fine appearance at the</p>
<p>review, and so far as the health and equipment of the men were</p>
<p>concerned the showing was good and satisfactory; but the horses were</p>
<p>thin and very much worn down by excessive and, it seemed to me,</p>
<p>unnecessary picket duty, for the cavalry picket-line almost</p>
<p>completely encircled the infantry and artillery camps of the army,</p>
<p>covering a distance, on a continuous line, of nearly sixty miles,</p>
<p>with hardly a mounted Confederate confronting it at any point.  From</p>
<p>the very beginning of the war the enemy had shown more wisdom</p>
<p>respecting his cavalry than we.  Instead of wasting its strength by a</p>
<p>policy of disintegration he, at an early day, had organized his</p>
<p>mounted force into compact masses, and plainly made it a favorite;</p>
<p>and, as usual, he was now husbanding the strength of his horses by</p>
<p>keeping them to the rear, so that in the spring he could bring them</p>
<p>out in good condition for the impending campaign.</p>
<p>Before and at the review I took in this situation, and determined to</p>
<p>remedy it if possible; so in due time I sought an interview with</p>
<p>General Meade and informed him that, as the effectiveness of my</p>
<p>command rested mainly on the strength of its horses, I thought the</p>
<p>duty it was then performing was both burdensome and wasteful.  I also</p>
<p>gave him my idea as to what the cavalry should do, the main purport</p>
<p>of which was that it ought to be kept concentrated to fight the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s cavalry.  Heretofore, the commander of the Cavalry Corps had</p>
<p>been, virtually, but an adjunct at army headquarters--a sort of chief</p>
<p>of cavalry--and my proposition seemed to stagger General Meade not a</p>
<p>little.  I knew that it would be difficult to overcome the recognized</p>
<p>custom of using the cavalry for the protection of trains and the</p>
<p>establishment of cordons around the infantry corps, and so far</p>
<p>subordinating its operations to the movements of the main army that</p>
<p>in name only was it a corps at all, but still I thought it my duty to</p>
<p>try.</p>
<p>At first General Meade would hardly listen to my proposition, for he</p>
<p>was filled with the prejudices that, from the beginning of the war,</p>
<p>had pervaded the army regarding the importance and usefulness of</p>
<p>cavalry, General Scott then predicting that the contest would be</p>
<p>settled by artillery, and thereafter refusing the services of</p>
<p>regiment after regiment of mounted troops.  General Meade deemed</p>
<p>cavalry fit for little more than guard and picket duty, and wanted to</p>
<p>know what would protect the transportation trains and artillery</p>
<p>reserve, cover the front of moving infantry columns, and secure his</p>
<p>flanks from intrusion, if my policy were pursued.  I told him that if</p>
<p>he would let me use the cavalry as I contemplated, he need have</p>
<p>little solicitude in these respects, for, with a mass of ten thousand</p>
<p>mounted men, it was my belief that I could make it so lively for the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s cavalry that, so far as attacks from it were concerned, the</p>
<p>flanks and rear of the Army of the Potomac would require little or no</p>
<p>defense, and claimed, further, that moving columns of infantry should</p>
<p>take care of their own fronts.  I also told him that it was my object</p>
<p>to defeat the enemy&#x27;s cavalry in a general combat, if possible, and</p>
<p>by such a result establish a feeling of confidence in my own troops</p>
<p>that would enable us after awhile to march where we pleased, for the</p>
<p>purpose of breaking General Lee&#x27;s communications and destroying the</p>
<p>resources from which his army was supplied.</p>
<p>The idea as here outlined was contrary to Meade&#x27;s convictions, for</p>
<p>though at different times since he commanded the Army of the Potomac</p>
<p>considerable bodies of the cavalry had been massed for some special</p>
<p>occasion, yet he had never agreed to the plan as a permanency, and</p>
<p>could not be bent to it now.  He gave little encouragement,</p>
<p>therefore, to what I proposed, yet the conversation was immediately</p>
<p>beneficial in one way, for when I laid before him the true condition</p>
<p>of the cavalry, he promptly relieved it from much of the arduous and</p>
<p>harassing picket service it was performing, thus giving me about two</p>
<p>weeks in which to nurse the horses before the campaign opened.</p>
<p>The interview also disclosed the fact that the cavalry commander</p>
<p>should be, according to General Meade&#x27;s views, at his headquarters</p>
<p>practically as one of his staff, through whom he would give detailed</p>
<p>directions as, in his judgment, occasion required.  Meade&#x27;s ideas and</p>
<p>mine being so widely divergent, disagreements arose between us later</p>
<p>during the battles of the Wilderness, which lack of concord ended in</p>
<p>some concessions on his part after the movement toward Spottsylvania</p>
<p>Court House began, and although I doubt that his convictions were</p>
<p>ever wholly changed, yet from that date on, in the organization of</p>
<p>the Army of the Potomac, the cavalry corps became more of a compact</p>
<p>body, with the same privileges and responsibilities that attached to</p>
<p>the other corps--conditions that never actually existed before.</p>
<p>On the 4th of May the Army of the Potomac moved against Lee, who was</p>
<p>occupying a defensive position on the south bank of the Rapidan.</p>
<p>After detailing the various detachments which I was obliged to supply</p>
<p>for escorts and other mounted duty, I crossed the river with an</p>
<p>effective force of about 10,000 troopers.  In the interval succeeding</p>
<p>my assignment to the command of the cavalry, I had taken the pains to</p>
<p>study carefully the topography of the country in eastern Virginia,</p>
<p>and felt convinced that, under the policy Meade intended I should</p>
<p>follow, there would be little opportunity for mounted troops to</p>
<p>acquit themselves well in a region so thickly wooded, and traversed</p>
<p>by so many almost parallel streams; but conscious that he would be</p>
<p>compelled sooner or later either to change his mind or partially give</p>
<p>way to the pressure of events, I entered on the campaign with the</p>
<p>loyal determination to aid zealously in all its plans.</p>
<p>General Lee&#x27;s army was located in its winter quarters behind</p>
<p>intrenchments that lay along the Rapidan for a distance of about</p>
<p>twenty miles; extending from Barnett&#x27;s to Morton&#x27;s ford.  The fords</p>
<p>below Morton&#x27;s were watched by a few small detachments of Confederate</p>
<p>cavalry, the main body of which, however, was encamped below</p>
<p>Hamilton&#x27;s crossing, where it could draw supplies from the rich</p>
<p>country along the Rappahannock.  Only a few brigades of Lee&#x27;s</p>
<p>infantry guarded the works along the river, the bulk of it being so</p>
<p>situated that it could be thrown to either flank toward which the</p>
<p>Union troops approached.</p>
<p>General Grant adopted the plan of moving by his left flank, with the</p>
<p>purpose of compelling Lee to come out from behind his intrenchments</p>
<p>along Mine Run and fight on equal terms.  Grant knew well the</p>
<p>character of country through which he would have to pass, but he was</p>
<p>confident that the difficulties of operation in the thickly wooded</p>
<p>region of the Wilderness would be counterbalanced by the facility</p>
<p>with which his position would enable him to secure a new base; and by</p>
<p>the fact that as he would thus cover Washington, there would be</p>
<p>little or no necessity for the authorities there to detach from his</p>
<p>force at some inopportune moment for the protection of that city.</p>
<p>In the move forward two divisions of my cavalry took the advance,</p>
<p>Gregg crossing the Rapidan at Ely&#x27;s ford and Wilson at Germania ford.</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s division remained in the rear to cover the trains and</p>
<p>reserve artillery, holding from Rapidan Station to Culpeper, and</p>
<p>thence through Stevensburg to the Rappahannock River.  Gregg crossed</p>
<p>the Rapidan before daylight, in advance of the Second Corps, and when</p>
<p>the latter reached Ely&#x27;s ford, he pushed on to Chancellorsville;</p>
<p>Wilson preceded the Fifth Corps to Germania ford, and when it reached</p>
<p>the river he made the crossing and moved rapidly by Wilderness</p>
<p>Tavern, as far as Parker&#x27;s Store, from which point he sent a heavy</p>
<p>reconnoissance toward Mine Run, the rest of his division bivouacking</p>
<p>in a strong position.  I myself proceeded to Chancellorsville and</p>
<p>fixed my headquarters at that place, whereon the 5th I was joined by</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s division.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, General Meade had crossed the Rapidan and established his</p>
<p>headquarters not far from Germania ford.  From that point he was in</p>
<p>direct communication with Wilson, whose original instructions from me</p>
<p>carried him only as far as Parker&#x27;s Store, but it being found, during</p>
<p>the night of the 4th, that the enemy was apparently unacquainted with</p>
<p>the occurrences of the day, Meade directed Wilson to advance in the</p>
<p>direction of Craig&#x27;s Meeting House; leaving one regiment to hold</p>
<p>Parker&#x27;s Store.  Wilson with the second brigade encountered Rosser&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade of cavalry just beyond the Meeting House, and drove it back</p>
<p>rapidly a distance of about two miles, holding it there till noon,</p>
<p>while his first brigade was halted on the north side of Robinson&#x27;s</p>
<p>Run near the junction of the Catharpen and Parker&#x27;s Store roads.</p>
<p>Up to this time Wilson had heard nothing of the approach of the Fifth</p>
<p>Corps, and the situation becoming threatening, he withdrew the second</p>
<p>brigade to the position occupied by the first, but scarcely had he</p>
<p>done so when he learned that at an early hour in the forenoon the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s infantry had appeared in his rear at Parker&#x27;s Store and cut</p>
<p>off his communication with General Meade.  Surprised at this, he</p>
<p>determined to withdraw to Todd&#x27;s Tavern, but before his resolution</p>
<p>could be put into execution the Confederates attacked him with a</p>
<p>heavy force, and at the same time began pushing troops down the</p>
<p>Catharpen road.  Wilson was now in a perplexing situation, sandwiched</p>
<p>between the Confederates who had cut him off in the rear at Parker&#x27;s</p>
<p>store and those occupying the Catharpen road, but he extricated his</p>
<p>command by passing it around the latter force, and reached Todd&#x27;s</p>
<p>Tavern by crossing the Po River at Corbin&#x27;s bridge.  General Meade</p>
<p>discovering that the enemy had interposed at Parker&#x27;s store between</p>
<p>Wilson and the Fifth Corps, sent me word to go to Wilson&#x27;s relief,</p>
<p>and this was the first intimation I received that Wilson had been</p>
<p>pushed out so far, but, surmising that he would retire in the</p>
<p>direction of Todd&#x27;s Tavern I immediately despatched Gregg&#x27;s division</p>
<p>there to his relief.  Just beyond Todd&#x27;s Tavern Gregg met Wilson, who</p>
<p>was now being followed by the enemy&#x27;s cavalry.  The pursuing force</p>
<p>was soon checked, and then driven back to Shady Grove Church, while</p>
<p>Wilson&#x27;s troops fell in behind Gregg&#x27;s line, somewhat the worse for</p>
<p>their morning&#x27;s adventure.</p>
<p>When the Army of the Potomac commenced crossing the Rapidan on the</p>
<p>4th, General J. E. B. Stuart, commanding the Confederate cavalry,</p>
<p>began concentrating his command on the right of Lee&#x27;s infantry,</p>
<p>bringing it from Hamilton&#x27;s crossing and other points where it had</p>
<p>been wintering.  Stuart&#x27;s force at this date was a little more than</p>
<p>eight thousand men, organized in two divisions, commanded by Generals</p>
<p>Wade Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee.  Hampton&#x27;s division was composed of</p>
<p>three brigades, commanded by Generals Cordon, Young, and Rosser;</p>
<p>Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s division comprised three brigades also, Generals W. H.</p>
<p>F. Lee, Lomax, and Wickham commanding them.</p>
<p>Information of this concentration, and of the additional fact that</p>
<p>the enemy&#x27;s cavalry about Hamilton&#x27;s crossing was all being drawn in,</p>
<p>reached me on the 5th, which obviated all necessity for my moving on</p>
<p>that point as I intended at the onset of the campaign.  The</p>
<p>responsibility for the safety of our trains and of the left flank of</p>
<p>the army still continued, however, so I made such dispositions of my</p>
<p>troops as to secure these objects by holding the line of the Brock</p>
<p>road beyond the Furnaces, and thence around to Todd&#x27;s Tavern and</p>
<p>Piney Branch Church.  On the 6th, through some false information,</p>
<p>General Meade became alarmed about his left flank, and sent me the</p>
<p>following note:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,</p>
<p>&quot;May 6, 1864.--1 o&#x27;clock P. M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Cavalry Corps</p>
<p>&quot;Your despatch of 11.45 a.m., received.  General Hancock has been</p>
<p>heavily pressed, and his left turned.  The major-general commanding</p>
<p>thinks that you had better draw in your cavalry, so as to secure the</p>
<p>protection of the trains.  The order requiring an escort for the</p>
<p>wagons to-night has been rescinded.</p>
<p>&quot;A. A. HUMPHREYS,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.&quot;</p>
<p>On the morning of the 6th Custer&#x27;s and Devin&#x27;s brigades had been</p>
<p>severely engaged at the Furnaces before I received the above note.</p>
<p>They had been most successful in repulsing the enemy&#x27;s attacks,</p>
<p>however, and I felt that the line taken up could be held; but the</p>
<p>despatch from General Humphreys was alarming, so I drew all the</p>
<p>cavalry close in toward Chancellorsville.  It was found later that</p>
<p>Hancock&#x27;s left had not been turned, and the points thus abandoned had</p>
<p>to be regained at a heavy cost in killed and wounded, to both the</p>
<p>cavalry and the infantry.</p>
<p>On the 7th of May, under directions from headquarters, Army of the</p>
<p>Potomac, the trains were put in motion to go into park at Piney</p>
<p>Branch Church, in anticipation of the movement that was about to be</p>
<p>made for the possession of Spottsylvania Court House.  I felt</p>
<p>confident that the order to move the trains there had been given</p>
<p>without a full understanding of the situation, for Piney Branch</p>
<p>Church was now held by the enemy, a condition which had resulted from</p>
<p>the order withdrawing the cavalry on account of the supposed disaster</p>
<p>to Hancock&#x27;s left the day before; but I thought the best way to</p>
<p>remedy matters was to hold the trains in the vicinity of Aldrich&#x27;s</p>
<p>till the ground on which it was intended to park them should be</p>
<p>regained.</p>
<p>This led to the battle of Todd&#x27;s Tavern, a spirited fight for the</p>
<p>possession of the crossroads at that point, participated in by the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s cavalry and Gregg&#x27;s division, and two brigades of Torbert&#x27;s</p>
<p>division, the latter commanded by Merritt, as Torbert became very ill</p>
<p>on the 6th, and had to be sent to the rear.  To gain the objective</p>
<p>point--the crossroads--I directed Gregg to assail the enemy on the</p>
<p>Catharpen road with Irvin Gregg&#x27;s brigade and drive him over Corbin&#x27;s</p>
<p>bridge, while Merritt attacked him with the Reserve brigade on the</p>
<p>Spottsylvania road in conjunction with Davies&#x27;s brigade of Gregg&#x27;s</p>
<p>division, which was to be put in on the Piney Branch Church road, and</p>
<p>unite with Merritt&#x27;s left.  Davies&#x27;s and Irvin Gregg&#x27;s brigades on my</p>
<p>right and left flanks met with some resistance, yet not enough to</p>
<p>deter them from, executing their orders.  In front of Merritt the</p>
<p>enemy held on more stubbornly, however, and there ensued an</p>
<p>exceedingly severe and, at times, fluctuating fight.  Finally the</p>
<p>Confederates gave way, and we pursued them almost to Spottsylvania</p>
<p>Court House; but deeming it prudent to recall the pursuers about</p>
<p>dark, I encamped Gregg&#x27;s and Merritt&#x27;s divisions in the open fields</p>
<p>to the east of Todd&#x27;s Tavern.</p>
<p>During the preceding three days the infantry corps of the army had</p>
<p>been engaged in the various conflicts known as the battles of the</p>
<p>Wilderness.  The success of the Union troops in those battles had not</p>
<p>been all that was desired, and General Grant now felt that it was</p>
<p>necessary to throw himself on Lee&#x27;s communications if possible, while</p>
<p>preserving his own intact by prolonging the movement to the left.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the evening of the 7th he determined to shift his whole</p>
<p>army toward Spottsylvania Court House, and initiated the movement by</p>
<p>a night march of the infantry to Todd&#x27;s Tavern.  In view of what was</p>
<p>contemplated, I gave orders to Gregg and Merritt to move at daylight</p>
<p>on the morning of the 8th, for the purpose of gaining possession of</p>
<p>Snell&#x27;s bridge over the Po River, the former by the crossing at</p>
<p>Corbin&#x27;s bridge and the latter by the Block House.  I also directed</p>
<p>Wilson, who was at Alsop&#x27;s house, to take possession of Spottsylvania</p>
<p>as early as possible on the morning of the 8th, and then move into</p>
<p>position at Snell&#x27;s bridge conjointly with the other two divisions.</p>
<p>Wilson&#x27;s orders remained as I had issued them, so he moved</p>
<p>accordingly and got possession of Spottsylvania, driving the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry a mile beyond, as will be seen by the following despatch sent</p>
<p>me at 9 A. M. of the 8th:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,</p>
<p>&quot;ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.</p>
<p>&quot;SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE, May 8, 1864 9 A. M.</p>
<p>&quot; LIEUTENANT-COLONEL FORSYTH, CHIEF-OF-STAFF, C. C.</p>
<p>&quot;Have run the enemy&#x27;s cavalry a mile from Spottsylvania Court House;</p>
<p>have charged them, and drove them through the village; am fighting</p>
<p>now with a considerable force, supposed to be Lee&#x27;s division.</p>
<p>Everything all right.</p>
<p>&quot;J. H. WILSON,</p>
<p>&quot;Brigadier-General Commanding.</p>
<p>During the night of the 7th General Meade arrived at Todd&#x27;s Tavern</p>
<p>and modified the orders I had given Gregg and Merritt, directing</p>
<p>Gregg simply to hold Corbin&#x27;s bridge, and Merritt to move out in</p>
<p>front of the infantry column marching on the Spottsylvania road.</p>
<p>Merritt proceeded to obey, but in advancing, our cavalry and infantry</p>
<p>became intermingled in the darkness, and much confusion and delay was</p>
<p>the consequence.  I had not been duly advised of these changes in</p>
<p>Gregg&#x27;s and Merritt&#x27;s orders, and for a time I had fears for the</p>
<p>safety of Wilson, but, while he was preparing to move on to form his</p>
<p>junction with Gregg and Merritt at Snell&#x27;s bridge, the advance of</p>
<p>Anderson (who was now commanding Longstreet&#x27;s corps) appeared on the</p>
<p>scene and drove him from Spottsylvania.</p>
<p>Had Gregg and Merritt been permitted to proceed as they were</p>
<p>originally instructed, it is doubtful whether the battles fought at</p>
<p>Spottsylvania would have occurred, for these two divisions would have</p>
<p>encountered the enemy at the Pa River, and so delayed his march as to</p>
<p>enable our infantry to reach Spottsylvania first, and thus force Lee</p>
<p>to take up a line behind the Po.  I had directed Wilson to move from</p>
<p>the left by &quot;the Gate&quot; through Spottsylvania to Snell&#x27;s bridge, while</p>
<p>Gregg and Merritt were to advance to the same point by Shady Grove</p>
<p>and the Block House.  There was nothing to prevent at least a partial</p>
<p>success of these operations; that is to say, the concentration of the</p>
<p>three divisions in front of Snell&#x27;s bridge, even if we could not</p>
<p>actually have gained it.  But both that important point and the</p>
<p>bridge on the Block House road were utterly ignored, and Lee&#x27;s</p>
<p>approach to Spottsylvania left entirely unobstructed, while three</p>
<p>divisions of cavalry remained practically ineffective by reason of</p>
<p>disjointed and irregular instructions.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th, when I found that such orders had been</p>
<p>given, I made some strong remonstrances against the course that had</p>
<p>been pursued, but it was then too late to carry out the combinations</p>
<p>I had projected the night before, so I proceeded to join Merritt on</p>
<p>the Spottsylvania road.  On reaching Merritt I found General Warren</p>
<p>making complaint that the cavalry were obstructing his infantry</p>
<p>column, so I drew Merritt off the road, and the leading division of</p>
<p>the Fifth Corps pushed up to the front.  It got into line about  11</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock, and advanced to take the village, but it did not go very far</p>
<p>before it struck Anderson&#x27;s corps, and was hurled back with heavy</p>
<p>loss.  This ended all endeavor to take Spottsylvania that day.</p>
<p>A little before noon General Meade sent for me, and when I reached</p>
<p>his headquarters I found that his peppery temper had got the better</p>
<p>of his good judgment, he showing a disposition to be unjust, laying</p>
<p>blame here and there for the blunders that had been committed.  He</p>
<p>was particularly severe on the cavalry, saying, among other things,</p>
<p>that it had impeded the march of the Fifth Corps by occupying the</p>
<p>Spottsylvania road.  I replied that if this were true, he himself had</p>
<p>ordered it there without my knowledge.  I also told him that he had</p>
<p>broken up my combinations, exposed Wilson&#x27;s division to disaster, and</p>
<p>kept Gregg unnecessarily idle, and further, repelled his insinuations</p>
<p>by saying that such disjointed operations as he had been requiring of</p>
<p>the cavalry for the last four days would render the corps inefficient</p>
<p>and useless before long.  Meade was very much irritated, and I was</p>
<p>none the less so.  One word brought on another, until, finally, I</p>
<p>told him that I could whip Stuart if he (Meade) would only let me,</p>
<p>but since he insisted on giving the cavalry directions without</p>
<p>consulting or even notifying me, he could henceforth command the</p>
<p>Cavalry Corps himself--that I would not give it another order.</p>
<p>The acrimonious interview ended with this remark, and after I left</p>
<p>him he went to General Grant&#x27;s headquarters and repeated the</p>
<p>conversation to him, mentioning that I had said that I could whip</p>
<p>Stuart.  At this General Grant remarked: &quot;Did he say so? Then let him</p>
<p>go out and do it.&quot;  This intimation was immediately acted upon by</p>
<p>General Meade, and a little later the following order came to me:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC</p>
<p>&quot;May 8th, 1864 1 P. M.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Cavalry Corps.</p>
<p>&quot;The major-general commanding directs you to immediately concentrate</p>
<p>your available mounted force, and with your ammunition trains and</p>
<p>such supply trains as are filled (exclusive of ambulances) proceed</p>
<p>against the enemy&#x27;s cavalry, and when your supplies are exhausted,</p>
<p>proceed via New Market and Green Bay to Haxall&#x27;s Landing on the James</p>
<p>River, there communicating with General Butler, procuring supplies</p>
<p>and return to this army.  Your dismounted men will be left with the</p>
<p>train here.</p>
<p>&quot;A. A. HUMPHREYS,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General, Chief-of-staff.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as the above order was received I issued instructions for the</p>
<p>concentration of the three divisions of cavalry at Aldrich&#x27;s to</p>
<p>prepare for the contemplated expedition.  Three days&#x27; rations for the</p>
<p>men were distributed, and half rations of grain for one day were</p>
<p>doled out for the horses.  I sent for Gregg, Merritt, and Wilson and</p>
<p>communicated the order to them, saying at the same time, &quot;We are</p>
<p>going out to fight Stuart&#x27;s cavalry in consequence of a suggestion</p>
<p>from me; we will give him a fair, square fight; we are strong, and I</p>
<p>know we can beat him, and in view of my recent representations to</p>
<p>General Meade I shall expect nothing but success.&quot;  I also indicated</p>
<p>to my division commanders the line of march I should take--moving in</p>
<p>one column around the right flank of Lee&#x27;s army to get in its rear--</p>
<p>and stated at the same time that it was my intention to fight Stuart</p>
<p>wherever he presented himself, and if possible go through to Haxall&#x27;s</p>
<p>Landing; but that if Stuart should successfully interpose between us</p>
<p>and that point we would swing back to the Army of the Potomac by</p>
<p>passing around the enemy&#x27;s left flank by way of Gordonsville.  At</p>
<p>first the proposition seemed to surprise the division commanders</p>
<p>somewhat, for hitherto even the boldest, mounted expeditions had been</p>
<p>confined to a hurried ride through the enemy&#x27;s country, without</p>
<p>purpose of fighting more than enough to escape in case of</p>
<p>molestation, and here and there to destroy a bridge.  Our move would</p>
<p>be a challenge to Stuart for a cavalry duel behind Lee&#x27;s lines, in</p>
<p>his own country, but the advantages which it was reasonable to</p>
<p>anticipate from the plan being quickly perceived, each division</p>
<p>commander entered into its support unhesitatingly, and at once set</p>
<p>about preparing for the march next day.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>
<p>THE EXPEDITION STARTS--DESTROYING SUPPLIES--OPENING OF THE FIGHT AT</p>
<p>YELLOW TAVERN--GENERAL CUSTER&#x27;S BRILLIANT CHARGE--DEATH OF GENERAL</p>
<p>STUART--REMOVING TORPEDOES--EXCITEMENT IN RICHMOND--A NIGHT MARCH--</p>
<p>ENTERPRISING NEWSBOYS--THE EFFECTS OF STUART&#x27;S DEFEAT AND DEATH--END</p>
<p>OF THE FIRST EXPEDITION--ITS GREAT SUCCESS AND BENEFICIAL RESULTS.</p>
<p>The expedition which resulted in the battle of Yellow Tavern and the</p>
<p>death of General Stuart started from the vicinity of Aldrich&#x27;s toward</p>
<p>Fredericksburg early on the morning of May 9, 1864, marching on the</p>
<p>plank-road, Merritt&#x27;s division leading.  When the column reached</p>
<p>Tabernacle Church it headed almost due east to the telegraph road,</p>
<p>and thence down that highway to Thornburg, and from that point</p>
<p>through Childsburg to Anderson&#x27;s crossing of the North Anna River, it</p>
<p>being my desire to put my command south of that stream if possible,</p>
<p>where it could procure forage before it should be compelled to fight.</p>
<p>The corps moved at a walk, three divisions on the same road, making a</p>
<p>column nearly thirteen miles in length, and marched around the right</p>
<p>flank of the enemy unsuspected until my rear guard , had passed</p>
<p>Massaponax Church.  Although the column was very long, I preferred to</p>
<p>move it all on one road rather than to attempt combinations for</p>
<p>carrying the divisions to any given point by different routes.</p>
<p>Unless the separate commands in an expedition of this nature are very</p>
<p>prompt in movement, and each fully equal to overcoming at once any</p>
<p>obstacle it may meet, combinations rarely work out as expected;</p>
<p>besides, an engagement was at all times imminent, hence it was</p>
<p>specially necessary to keep the whole force well together.</p>
<p>As soon as the Ny, Po, and Ta rivers were crossed, each ,of which</p>
<p>streams would have afforded an excellent defensive line to the enemy,</p>
<p>all anxiety as to our passing around Lee&#x27;s army was removed, and our</p>
<p>ability to cross the North Anna placed beyond doubt. Meanwhile</p>
<p>General Stuart had discovered what we were about, and he set his</p>
<p>cavalry in motion, sending General Fitzhugh Lee to follow and attack</p>
<p>my rear on the Childsburg road, Stuart himself marching by way of</p>
<p>Davenport&#x27;s bridge, on the North Anna, toward Beaver Dam Station,</p>
<p>near which place his whole command was directed to unite the next</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>My column having passed the Ta River, Stuart attacked its rear with</p>
<p>considerable vigor, in the hope that he could delay my whole force</p>
<p>long enough to permit him to get at least a part of his command in my</p>
<p>front; but this scheme was frustrated by Davies&#x27;s brigade, which I</p>
<p>directed to fight as a rear-guard, holding on at one position and</p>
<p>then at another along the line of march just enough to deter the</p>
<p>enemy from a too rapid advance.  Davies performed this responsible</p>
<p>and trying duty with tact and good judgment, following the main</p>
<p>column steadily as it progressed to the south, and never once</p>
<p>permitting Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s advance to encroach far enough to compel a</p>
<p>halt of my main body.  About dark Merritt&#x27;s division crossed the</p>
<p>North Anna at Anderson&#x27;s ford, while Gregg and Wilson encamped on the</p>
<p>north side, having engaged the enemy, who still hung on my rear up to</p>
<p>a late hour at night.</p>
<p>After Merritt&#x27;s division passed the river, Custer&#x27;s brigade proceeded</p>
<p>on to Beaver Dam Station to cut the Virginia Central railroad.</p>
<p>Before reaching the station he met a small force of the enemy, but</p>
<p>this he speedily drove off, recapturing from it about four hundred</p>
<p>Union prisoners, who had been taken recently in the Wilderness and</p>
<p>were being conducted to Richmond.  Custer also destroyed the station,</p>
<p>two locomotives, three trains of cars, ninety wagons, from eight to</p>
<p>ten miles of railroad and telegraph lines, some two hundred thousand</p>
<p>pounds of bacon and other supplies, amounting in all to about a</p>
<p>million and a half of rations, and nearly all they medical stores of</p>
<p>General Lee&#x27;s army, which had been moved from Orange Court House</p>
<p>either because Lee wished to have them directly in his rear or</p>
<p>because he contemplated falling back to the North Anna.</p>
<p>On the morning of the l0th Gregg and Wilson, while crossing the North</p>
<p>Anna, were again attacked, but were covered by the division on the</p>
<p>south side of the stream; the passage was effected without much loss,</p>
<p>notwithstanding the approach of Stuart on the south bank from the</p>
<p>direction of Davenport&#x27;s bridge.  The possession of Beaver Dam gave</p>
<p>us an important point, as it opened a way toward Richmond by the</p>
<p>Negro-foot road.  It also enabled us to obtain forage for our well-</p>
<p>nigh famished animals, and to prepare for fighting the enemy, who, I</p>
<p>felt sure, would endeavor to interpose between my column and</p>
<p>Richmond.</p>
<p>Stuart had hardly united his troops near Beaver Dam when he realized</p>
<p>that concentrating there was a mistake, so he began making</p>
<p>dispositions for remedying his error, and while we leisurely took the</p>
<p>Negro-foot toad toward Richmond, he changed his tactics and hauled</p>
<p>off from my rear, urging his horses to the death in order to get in</p>
<p>between Richmond and my column.  This he effected about 10 o&#x27;clock on</p>
<p>the morning of the 11th, concentrating at Yellow Tavern, six miles</p>
<p>from the city, on the Brook turnpike.  His change of tactics left my</p>
<p>march on the l0th practically unmolested, and we quietly encamped</p>
<p>that night on the south bank of the South Anna, near Ground Squirrel</p>
<p>Bridge.  Here we procured an abundance of forage, and as the distance</p>
<p>traveled that day had been only fifteen to eighteen miles, men and</p>
<p>horses were able to obtain a good rest during the night.</p>
<p>At 2 o&#x27;clock in the morning, May 11, Davies&#x27;s brigade of Gregg&#x27;s</p>
<p>division marched for Ashland to cut the Fredericksburg railroad.</p>
<p>Arriving there before the head of the enemy&#x27;s column, which had to</p>
<p>pass through this same place to reach Yellow Tavern, Davies drove out</p>
<p>a small force occupying the town, burnt a train of cars and a</p>
<p>locomotive, destroyed the railroad for some distance, and rejoined</p>
<p>the main column at Allen&#x27;s Station on the Fredericksburg and Richmond</p>
<p>railroad.  From Allen&#x27;s Station the whole command moved on Yellow</p>
<p>Tavern, Merritt in the lead, Wilson following, and Gregg in the rear.</p>
<p>The appearance of Davies&#x27;s brigade at Ashland in the morning had had</p>
<p>the effect of further mystifying the enemy as to my intentions; and</p>
<p>while he held it incumbent to place himself between me and Richmond,</p>
<p>yet he was still so uncertain of my movements that he committed the</p>
<p>same fault that he did the first day, when he divided his force and</p>
<p>sent a part to follow me on the Childsburg road.  He now divided his</p>
<p>command again, sending a portion to hang upon my rear, while he</p>
<p>proceeded with the rest to Yellow Tavern.  This separation not only</p>
<p>materially weakened the force which might have been thrown across my</p>
<p>line of march, but it also enabled me to attack with almost my entire</p>
<p>corps, while occupying the pursuers with a small rearguard.</p>
<p>By forced marches General Stuart succeeded in reaching Yellow Tavern</p>
<p>ahead of me on May 11; and the presence of, his troops, on the</p>
<p>Ashland and Richmond road becoming known to Merritt as he was</p>
<p>approaching the Brook turnpike, this general pressed forward at once</p>
<p>to the attack.  Pushing his division to the front, he soon got</p>
<p>possession of the turnpike and drove the enemy back several hundred</p>
<p>yards to the east of it.  This success had the effect of throwing the</p>
<p>head of my column to the east of the pike, and I quickly brought up</p>
<p>Wilson and one of Gregg&#x27;s brigades to take advantage of the situation</p>
<p>by forming a line of battle on that side or the road.  Meanwhile the</p>
<p>enemy, desperate but still confident, poured in a heavy fire from his</p>
<p>line and from a battery which enfiladed the Brook road, and made</p>
<p>Yellow Tavern an uncomfortably hot place.  Gibbs&#x27;s and Devin&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigades, however, held fast there, while Custer, supported by</p>
<p>Chapman&#x27;s brigade, attacked the enemy&#x27;s left and battery in a mounted</p>
<p>charge.</p>
<p>Custer&#x27;s charge, with Chapman on his flank and the rest of Wilson&#x27;s</p>
<p>division sustaining him, was brilliantly executed.  Beginning at a</p>
<p>walk, he increased his gait to a trot, and then at full speed rushed</p>
<p>at the enemy.  At the same moment the dismounted troops along my</p>
<p>whole front moved forward, and as Custer went through the battery,</p>
<p>capturing two of the guns with their cannoneers and breaking up the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s left, Gibbs and Devin drove his centre and right from the</p>
<p>field.  Gregg meanwhile, with equal success, charged the force in his</p>
<p>rear-Gordon&#x27;s brigadeand the engagement ended by giving us complete</p>
<p>control of the road to Richmond.  We captured a number of prisoners,</p>
<p>and the casualties on both sides were quite severe, General Stuart</p>
<p>himself falling mortally wounded, and General James B. Gordon, one of</p>
<p>his brigade commanders, being killed.</p>
<p>After Custer&#x27;s charge, the Confederate cavalry was badly broken up,</p>
<p>the main portion of it being driven in a rout toward Ashland and a</p>
<p>small part in the direction of Richmond, which latter force finally</p>
<p>rejoined Fitzhugh Lee near Mechanicsville.  A reconnoitring party</p>
<p>being now sent up the Brook turnpike toward the city, dashed across</p>
<p>the South Fork of the Chickahominy, drove a small force from the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s exterior intrenchments and went within them.  I followed this</p>
<p>party, and after a little exploration found between the two lines of</p>
<p>works a country road that led across to the pike which runs from</p>
<p>Mechanicsville to Richmond.  I thought we could go around within the</p>
<p>outer line of works by this country road across to the Mechanicsville</p>
<p>pike on the south side of the Chickahominy, and encamp the next night</p>
<p>at Fair Oaks; so I determined to make the movement after dark, being</p>
<p>influenced in this to some extent by reports received during the</p>
<p>afternoon from colored people, to the effect that General B. F.</p>
<p>Butler&#x27;s army had reached a small stream on the south side of the</p>
<p>James, about four miles south of Richmond.  If I could succeed in</p>
<p>getting through by this road, not only would I have a shorter line of</p>
<p>march to Haxall&#x27;s landing, but there was also a possibility that I</p>
<p>could help Butler somewhat by joining him so near Richmond.</p>
<p>Therefore, after making the wounded as comfortable as possible, we</p>
<p>commenced the march about 11 o&#x27;clock on the night of the 1lth, and</p>
<p>massed the command on the plateau south of the Meadow bridge near</p>
<p>daylight on the 12th.</p>
<p>The enemy, anticipating that I would march by this route, had planted</p>
<p>torpedoes along it, and many of these exploded as the column passed</p>
<p>over them, killing several horses and wounding a few men, but beyond</p>
<p>this we met with no molestation.  The torpedoes were loaded shells</p>
<p>planted on each side of the road, and so connected by wires attached</p>
<p>to friction-tubes in the shells, that when a horse&#x27;s hoof struck a</p>
<p>wire the shell was exploded by the jerk on the improvised lanyard.</p>
<p>After the loss of several horses and the wounding of some of the men</p>
<p>by these torpedoes, I gave directions to have them removed, if</p>
<p>practicable, so about twenty-five of the prisoners were brought up</p>
<p>and made to get down on their knees, feel for the wires in the</p>
<p>darkness, follow them up and unearth the shells.  The prisoners</p>
<p>reported the owner of one of the neighboring houses to be the</p>
<p>principal person who had engaged in planting these shells, and I</p>
<p>therefore directed that some of them be carried and placed in the</p>
<p>cellar of his house, arranged to explode if the enemy&#x27;s column came</p>
<p>that way, while he and his family were brought off as prisoners and</p>
<p>held till after daylight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the most intense excitement prevailed in Richmond.  The</p>
<p>Confederates, supposing that their capital was my objective point,</p>
<p>were straining every effort to put it in a state of defense, and had</p>
<p>collected between four and five thousand irregular troops, under</p>
<p>General Bragg, besides bringing up three brigades of infantry from</p>
<p>the force confronting General Butler south of the James River, the</p>
<p>alarm being intensified by the retreat, after the defeat at Yellow</p>
<p>Tavern, of Stuart&#x27;s cavalry, now under General Fitzhugh Lee, by way</p>
<p>of Ashland to Mechanicsville, on the north side of the Chickahominy,</p>
<p>for falling back in that direction, left me between them and</p>
<p>Richmond.</p>
<p>Our march during the night of the 11th was very tedious, on account</p>
<p>of the extreme darkness and frequent showers of rain; but at daylight</p>
<p>on the 12th the head of my column, under Wilson, reached the</p>
<p>Mechanicsville pike.  Here Wilson, encountering the enemy&#x27;s works and</p>
<p>batteries manned by General Bragg&#x27;s troops, endeavored to pass.  In</p>
<p>this he failed, and as soon as I was notified that it was</p>
<p>impracticable to reach Fair Oaks by passing between the works and the</p>
<p>Chickahominy, Custer&#x27;s brigade was directed to make the crossing to</p>
<p>the north side of the Chickahominy, at the Meadow bridge.  Custer</p>
<p>moved rapidly for the bridge, but found it destroyed, and that the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s cavalry was posted on the north side, in front of</p>
<p>Mechanicsville.  When this information came back, I ordered Merritt</p>
<p>to take his whole division and repair the bridge, instructing him</p>
<p>that the crossing must be made at all hazards; for, in view of an</p>
<p>impending attack by the enemy&#x27;s infantry in Richmond, it was</p>
<p>necessary that I should have the bridge as a means of egress in case</p>
<p>of serious disaster.</p>
<p>All the time that Merritt was occupied in this important duty, the</p>
<p>enemy gave great annoyance to the working party by sweeping the</p>
<p>bridge with a section of artillery and a fire from the supporting</p>
<p>troops, so a small force was thrown across to drive them away.  When</p>
<p>Merritt had passed two regiments over, they attacked, but were</p>
<p>repulsed.  The work on the, bridge continued, however, not-</p>
<p>withstanding this discomfiture; and when it was finished, Merritt</p>
<p>crossed nearly all his division, dismounted, and again attacked the</p>
<p>enemy, this time carrying the line, of temporary breastworks, built</p>
<p>with logs and rails, and pursuing his broken troops toward Gaines&#x27;s</p>
<p>Mills.</p>
<p>While Merritt was engaged in this affair, the Confederates advanced</p>
<p>from behind their works at Richmond, and attacked Wilson and Gregg.</p>
<p>Wilson&#x27;s troops were driven back in some confusion at first; but</p>
<p>Gregg, in anticipation of attack, had hidden a heavy line of</p>
<p>dismounted men in a bushy ravine on his front, and when the enemy</p>
<p>marched upon it, with much display and under the eye of the President</p>
<p>of the Confederacy, this concealed line opened a destructive fire</p>
<p>with repeating carbines; and at the same time the batteries of horse-</p>
<p>artillery, under Captain Robinson, joining in the contest, belched</p>
<p>forth shot and shell with fatal effect.  The galling fire caused the</p>
<p>enemy to falter, and while still wavering Wilson rallied his men, and</p>
<p>turning some of them against the right flank of the Confederates,</p>
<p>broke their line, and compelled them to withdraw for security behind</p>
<p>the heavy works thrown up for the defense of the city in 1862.</p>
<p>By destroying the Meadow bridge and impeding my column on the</p>
<p>Mechanicsville, pike, the enemy thought to corner us completely, for</p>
<p>he still maintained the force in Gregg&#x27;s rear that had pressed it the</p>
<p>day before; but the repulse of his infantry ended all his hopes of</p>
<p>doing us any serious damage on the limited ground between the</p>
<p>defenses of Richmond and the Chickahominy.  He felt certain that on</p>
<p>account of the recent heavy rains we could not cross the Chickahominy</p>
<p>except by the Meadow bridge, and it also seemed clear to him that we</p>
<p>could not pass between the river and his intrenchments; therefore he</p>
<p>hoped to ruin us, or at least compel us to return by the same route</p>
<p>we had taken in coming, in which case we would run into Gordon&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade, but the signal repulse of Bragg&#x27;s infantry dispelled these</p>
<p>illusions.</p>
<p>Even had it not been our good fortune to defeat him, we could have</p>
<p>crossed the Chickahominy if necessary at several points that were</p>
<p>discovered by scouting parties which, while the engagement was going</p>
<p>on, I had sent out to look up fords.  This means of getting out from</p>
<p>the circumscribed plateau I did not wish to use, however, unless</p>
<p>there was no alternative, for I wished to demonstrate to the Cavalry</p>
<p>Corps the impossibility of the enemy&#x27;s destroying or capturing so</p>
<p>large a body of mounted troops.</p>
<p>The chances of seriously injuring, us were more favorable to the</p>
<p>enemy this time than ever they were afterward, for with the troops</p>
<p>from Richmond, comprising three brigades of veterans and about five</p>
<p>thousand irregulars on my front and right flank, with Gordon&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry in the rear, and Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry on my left flank,</p>
<p>holding the Chickahominy and Meadow bridge, I was apparently hemmed</p>
<p>in on every side, but relying on the celerity with which mounted</p>
<p>troops could be moved, I felt perfectly confident that the seemingly</p>
<p>perilous situation could be relieved under circumstances even worse</p>
<p>than those then surrounding us.  Therefore, instead of endeavoring to</p>
<p>get away without a fight, I concluded that there would be little</p>
<p>difficulty in withdrawing, even should I be beaten, and none whatever</p>
<p>if I defeated the enemy.</p>
<p>In accordance with this view I accepted battle; and the complete</p>
<p>repulse of the enemy&#x27;s infantry, which assailed us from his</p>
<p>intrenchments, and of Gordon&#x27;s cavalry, which pressed Gregg on the</p>
<p>Brook road, ended the contest in our favor.  The rest of the day we</p>
<p>remained on the battle-field undisturbed, and our time was spent in</p>
<p>collecting the wounded, burying the dead, grazing the horses, and</p>
<p>reading the Richmond journals, two small newsboys with commendable</p>
<p>enterprise having come within our lines from the Confederate capital</p>
<p>to sell their papers.  They were sharp youngsters, and having come</p>
<p>well supplied, they did a thrifty business.  When their stock in</p>
<p>trade was all disposed of they wished to return, but they were so</p>
<p>intelligent and observant that I thought their mission involved other</p>
<p>purposes than the mere sale of newspapers, so they were held till we</p>
<p>crossed the Chickahominy and then turned loose.</p>
<p>After Merritt had crossed the Chickahominy and reached</p>
<p>Mechanicsville, I sent him orders to push on to Gaines&#x27;s Mills.  Near</p>
<p>the latter place he fell in with the enemy&#x27;s cavalry again, and</p>
<p>sending me word, about 4 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon I crossed the</p>
<p>Chickahominy with Wilson and Gregg, but when we overtook Merritt he</p>
<p>had already brushed the Confederates away, and my whole command went</p>
<p>into camp between Walnut Grove and Gaines&#x27;s Mills.</p>
<p>The main purposes of the expedition had now been executed. They were</p>
<p>&quot;to break up General Lee&#x27;s railroad communications, destroy such</p>
<p>depots of supplies as could be found in his rear, and to defeat</p>
<p>General Stuart&#x27;s cavalry.&quot;  Many miles of the Virginia Central and of</p>
<p>the, Richmond and Fredericksburg railroads were broken up, and</p>
<p>several of the bridges on each burnt.  At Beaver Dam, Ashland, and</p>
<p>other places, about two millions of rations had been captured and</p>
<p>destroyed. The most important of all, however, was the defeat of</p>
<p>Stuart.  Since the beginning of the war this general had</p>
<p>distinguished himself by his management of the Confederate mounted</p>
<p>force.  Under him the cavalry of Lee&#x27;s army had been nurtured, and</p>
<p>had acquired such prestige that it thought itself well-nigh</p>
<p>invincible; indeed, in the early years of the war it had proved to be</p>
<p>so.  This was now dispelled by the successful march we had made in</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s rear; and the discomfiture of Stuart at Yellow Tavern had</p>
<p>inflicted a blow from which entire recovery was impossible.</p>
<p>In its effect on the Confederate cause the defeat of Stuart was most</p>
<p>disheartening, but his death was even a greater calamity, as is</p>
<p>evidenced by the words of a Confederate writer (Cooke), who says:</p>
<p>&quot;Stuart could be ill spared at this critical moment, and General Lee</p>
<p>was plunged into the deepest melancholy at the intelligence of his</p>
<p>death.  When it reached him he retired from those around him, and</p>
<p>remained for some time communing with his own heart and memory.  When</p>
<p>one of his staff entered and spoke of Stuart, General Lee said: &#x27;I</p>
<p>can scarcely think of him without weeping.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the camp near Gaines&#x27;s Mills I resumed the march to Haxall&#x27;s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Landing, the point on the James River contemplated in my instructions</p>
<p>where I was to obtain supplies from General Butler.  We got to the</p>
<p>James on the 14th with all our wounded and a large number of</p>
<p>prisoners, and camped between Haxall&#x27;s and Shirley.  The prisoners,</p>
<p>as well as the captured guns, were turned over to General Butler&#x27;s</p>
<p>provost-marshal, and our wounded were quickly and kindly cared for by</p>
<p>his surgeons.  Ample supplies, also, in the way of forage and</p>
<p>rations, were furnished us by General Butler, and the work of</p>
<p>refitting for our return to the Army of the Potomac was vigorously</p>
<p>pushed. By the 17th all was ready, and having learned by scouting</p>
<p>parties sent in the direction of Richmond and as far as Newmarket</p>
<p>that the enemy&#x27;s cavalry was returning to Lee&#x27;s army I started that</p>
<p>evening on my return march, crossing the Chickahominy at Jones&#x27;s</p>
<p>bridge, and bivouacking on the 19th near Baltimore crossroads.</p>
<p>My uncertainty of what had happened to the Army of the Potomac in our</p>
<p>absence, and as to where I should find it, made our getting back a</p>
<p>problem somewhat difficult of solution, particularly as I knew that</p>
<p>reinforcements for Lee had come up from the south to Richmond, and</p>
<p>that most likely some of these troops were being held at different</p>
<p>points on the route to intercept my column.  Therefore I determined</p>
<p>to pass the Pamunkey River at the White House, and sent to Fort</p>
<p>Monroe for a pontoon-bridge on which to make the crossing.  While</p>
<p>waiting for the pontoons I ordered Custer to proceed with his brigade</p>
<p>to Hanover Station, to destroy the railroad bridge over the South</p>
<p>Anna, a little beyond that place; at the same time I sent Gregg and</p>
<p>Wilson to Cold Harbor, to demonstrate in the direction of Richmond as</p>
<p>far as Mechanicsville, so as to cover Custer&#x27;s movements.  Merritt,</p>
<p>with the remaining brigades of his division, holding fast at</p>
<p>Baltimore crossroads to await events.</p>
<p>After Gregg and Custer had gone, it was discovered that the railroad</p>
<p>bridge over the Pamunkey, near the White House, had been destroyed</p>
<p>but partially--the cross-ties and stringers being burned in places</p>
<p>only--and that it was practicable to repair it sufficiently to carry</p>
<p>us over.  In view of this information General Merritt&#x27;s two brigades</p>
<p>were at once put on the duty of reconstructing the bridge.  By</p>
<p>sending mounted parties through the surrounding country, each man of</p>
<p>which would bring in a board or a plank, Merritt soon accumulated</p>
<p>enough lumber for the flooring, and in one day the bridge was made</p>
<p>practicable.  On the 22d Gregg, Wilson, and Custer returned.  The</p>
<p>latter had gone on his expedition as far as Hanover Station,</p>
<p>destroyed some commissary stores there, and burned two trestle</p>
<p>bridges over Hanover Creek.  This done, he deemed it prudent to</p>
<p>retire to Hanovertown.  The next morning he again marched to Hanover</p>
<p>Station, and there ascertained that a strong force of the enemy,</p>
<p>consisting of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, was posted at the</p>
<p>South Anna bridges.  These troops had gone there from Richmond en</p>
<p>route to reinforce Lee.  In the face of this impediment Custer&#x27;s</p>
<p>mission could not be executed fully, so he returned to Baltimore</p>
<p>crossroads.</p>
<p>The whole command was drawn in by noon of the 22d, and that day it</p>
<p>crossed the Pamunkey by Merritt&#x27;s reconstructed bridge, marching to</p>
<p>Ayletts, on the Mattapony River, the same night.  Here I learned from</p>
<p>citizens, and from prisoners taken during the day by scouting parties</p>
<p>sent toward Hanover Court House, that Lee had been, forced from his</p>
<p>position near Spottsylvania Court House and compelled to retire to</p>
<p>the line of the North Anna.  I then determined to rejoin the Army of</p>
<p>the Potomac at the earliest moment, which I did by making for</p>
<p>Chesterfield Station, where I reported to General Meade on the 24th</p>
<p>of May.</p>
<p>Our return to Chesterfield ended the first independent expedition the</p>
<p>Cavalry Corps had undertaken since coming under my command, and our</p>
<p>success was commended highly by Generals Grant and Meade, both</p>
<p>realizing that our operations in the rear of Lee had disconcerted and</p>
<p>alarmed that general so much as to aid materially in forcing his</p>
<p>retrograde march, and both acknowledged that, by drawing off the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s cavalry during the past fortnight, we had enabled them to</p>
<p>move the Army of the Potomac and its enormous trains without</p>
<p>molestation in the manoeuvres that had carried it to the North Anna.</p>
<p>Then, too, great quantities of provisions and munitions of war had</p>
<p>been destroyed--stores that the enemy had accumulated at sub-depots</p>
<p>from strained resources and by difficult means; the railroads that</p>
<p>connected Lee with Richmond broken, the most successful cavalry</p>
<p>leader of the South killed, and in addition to all this there had</p>
<p>been inflicted on the Confederate mounted troops the most thorough</p>
<p>defeat that had yet befallen them in Virginia.</p>
<p>When the expedition set out the Confederate authorities in Richmond</p>
<p>were impressed, and indeed convinced, that my designs contemplated</p>
<p>the capture of that city, and notwithstanding the loss they sustained</p>
<p>in the defeat and death of Stuart, and their repulse the succeeding</p>
<p>day, they drew much comfort from the fact that I had not entered</p>
<p>their capital.  Some Confederate writers have continued to hold this</p>
<p>theory and conviction since the war.  In this view they were and are</p>
<p>in error.  When Stuart was defeated the main purpose of my</p>
<p>instructions had been carried out, and my thoughts then turned to</p>
<p>joining General Butler to get supplies.  I believed that I could do</p>
<p>this by cutting across to the Mechanicsville pike and Fair Oaks on</p>
<p>the south side of the Chickahominy, but the failure of Wilson&#x27;s</p>
<p>column to get possession of the outwork which commanded the pike</p>
<p>necessitated my crossing at Meadow bridge, and then moving by</p>
<p>Mechanicsville and Gaines&#x27;s Mills instead of by the shorter route.</p>
<p>Moreover, my information regarding General Butler&#x27;s position was</p>
<p>incorrect, so that even had I been successful in getting to Fair Oaks</p>
<p>by the direct road I should still have gained nothing thereby, for I</p>
<p>should still have been obliged to continue down the James River to</p>
<p>Haxall&#x27;s.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>
<p>GENERAL WILSON&#x27;S ADVANCE TOWARD HANOVER COURT HOUSE--CROSSING THE</p>
<p>PAMUNKEY--ENGAGEMENT OF HAWE&#x27;S SHOP--FIGHT AT MATADEQUIN CREEK--</p>
<p>CAPTURE OF COLD HARBOR--THE FIGHT TO RETAIN THE PLACE--MOVEMENTS OF</p>
<p>GENERAL WILSON.</p>
<p>When I rejoined the Army of the Potomac, near Chesterfield Station,</p>
<p>the heavy battles around Spottsylvania had been fought, and the</p>
<p>complicated manoeuvres by which the whole Union force was swung</p>
<p>across the North Anna were in process of execution.  In conjunction</p>
<p>with these manoeuvres Wilson&#x27;s division was sent to the right flank</p>
<p>of the army, where he made a reconnoissance south of the North Anna</p>
<p>as far as Little River, crossing the former stream near Jericho</p>
<p>Mills.  Wilson was to operate from day to day on that flank as it</p>
<p>swung to the south, covering to New Castle ferry each advance of the</p>
<p>infantry and the fords left behind on the march.  From the 26th to</p>
<p>the 30th these duties kept Wilson constantly occupied, and also</p>
<p>necessitated a considerable dispersion of his force, but by the 31st</p>
<p>he was enabled to get all his division together again, and crossing</p>
<p>to the south side of the Pamunkey at New Castle ferry, he advanced</p>
<p>toward Hanover Court House.  Near Dr Pride&#x27;s house he encountered a</p>
<p>division of the enemy&#x27;s cavalry under General W. H. F. Lee, and drove</p>
<p>it back across Mechamp&#x27;s Creek, thus opening communication with the</p>
<p>right of our infantry resting near Phillips&#x27;s Mills.  Just as this</p>
<p>had been done, a little before dark, Wilson received an order from</p>
<p>General Meade directing him to push on toward Richmond until he</p>
<p>encountered the Confederates in such strength that he could no longer</p>
<p>successfully contend against them, and in compliance with this order</p>
<p>occupied Hanover Court House that same day.  Resuming his march at</p>
<p>daylight on June 1, he went ahead on the Ashland road while sending</p>
<p>Chapman&#x27;s brigade up the south bank of the South Anna to destroy the</p>
<p>bridges on that stream.  Chapman having succeeded in this work,</p>
<p>Wilson re-united his whole command and endeavored to hold Ashland,</p>
<p>but finding the Confederate cavalry and infantry there in strong</p>
<p>force, he was obliged to withdraw to Dr. Price&#x27;s house.  Here he</p>
<p>learned that the army had gone to the left toward Cold Harbor, so on</p>
<p>the 2d of June he moved to Hawe&#x27;s Shop.</p>
<p>While Wilson was operating thus on the right, I had to cover with</p>
<p>Gregg&#x27;s and Torbert&#x27;s divisions the crossing of the army over the</p>
<p>Pamunkey River at and near Hanovertown.  Torbert having recovered</p>
<p>from the illness which overtook him in the Wilderness, had now</p>
<p>returned to duty.  The march to turn the enemy&#x27;s right began on the</p>
<p>26th.  Torbert and Gregg in advance, to secure the crossings of the</p>
<p>Pamunkey and demonstrate in such manner as to deceive the enemy as</p>
<p>much as possible in the movement, the two cavalry divisions being</p>
<p>supported by General D. A. Russell&#x27;s division of the Sixth Corps.</p>
<p>To attain this end in the presence of an ever-watchful foe who had</p>
<p>just recently been reinforced in considerable numbers from Richmond</p>
<p>and further south--almost enough to make up the losses he had</p>
<p>sustained in the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania--required the most</p>
<p>vigorous and zealous work on the part of those to whom had been</p>
<p>allotted the task of carrying out the initial manoeuvres.  Torbert</p>
<p>started for Taylor&#x27;s ford on the Pamunkey with directions to</p>
<p>demonstrate heavily at that point till after dark, as if the crossing</p>
<p>was to be made there, and having thus impressed the enemy, he was to</p>
<p>leave a small guard, withdraw quietly, and march to Hanovertown ford,</p>
<p>where the real crossing was to be effected.  Meanwhile Gregg marched</p>
<p>to Littlepage&#x27;s crossing of the Pamunkey, with instructions to make</p>
<p>feints in the same manner as Torbert until after dark, when he was to</p>
<p>retire discreetly, leaving a small force to keep up the</p>
<p>demonstration, and then march rapidly to Hanovertown crossing, taking</p>
<p>with him the pontoon-bridge.</p>
<p>At the proper hour Russell took up the march and followed the</p>
<p>cavalry.  The troops were in motion all night, undergoing the usual</p>
<p>delays incident to night marches, and, early on the morning of the</p>
<p>27th the crossing was made, Custer&#x27;s brigade of Torbert&#x27;s division</p>
<p>driving from the ford about one hundred of the enemy&#x27;s cavalry, and</p>
<p>capturing between thirty and forty prisoners.  The remainder of</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s division followed this brigade and advanced to Hanovertown,</p>
<p>where General Gordon&#x27;s brigade of Confederate cavalry was met.</p>
<p>Torbert attacked this force with Devin&#x27;s brigade, while he sent</p>
<p>Custer to Hawe&#x27;s Shop, from which point a road leading to the right</p>
<p>was taken that brought him in rear of the enemy&#x27;s cavalry; when the</p>
<p>Confederates discovered this manoeuvre, they retired in the direction</p>
<p>of Hanover Court House.  Pursuit continued as far as a little stream</p>
<p>called Crump&#x27;s Creek, and here Torbert was halted, Gregg moving up on</p>
<p>his line meanwhile, and Russell encamping near the crossing of the</p>
<p>river.  This completed our task of gaining a foothold south of the</p>
<p>Pamunkey, and on the 28th the main army crossed unharassed and took</p>
<p>up a position behind my line, extending south from the river, with</p>
<p>the Sixth Corps on the right across the Hanover Court House road at</p>
<p>Crump&#x27;s Creek, the Second Corps on the left of the Sixth, and the</p>
<p>Fifth Corps about two miles in front of Hanovertown, its left</p>
<p>extending to the Tolopotomy.</p>
<p>There was now much uncertainty in General Grant&#x27;s mind as to the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s whereabouts, and there were received daily the most</p>
<p>conflicting statements as to the nature of Lee&#x27;s movements.  It</p>
<p>became necessary, therefore, to find out by an actual demonstration</p>
<p>what Lee was doing, and I was required to reconnoitre in the</p>
<p>direction of Mechanicsville.  For this purpose I moved Gregg&#x27;s</p>
<p>division out toward this town by way of Hawe&#x27;s Shop, and when it had</p>
<p>gone about three-fourths of a mile beyond the Shop the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry was discovered dismounted and disposed behind a temporary</p>
<p>breastwork of rails and logs.</p>
<p>This was the first occasion on which, since the battle of Yellow</p>
<p>Tavern, the Confederate troopers had confronted us in large numbers,</p>
<p>their mounted operations, like ours, having been dependent more or</p>
<p>less on the conditions that grew out of the movements in which Lee&#x27;s</p>
<p>infantry had been engaged since the 14th of May.</p>
<p>On that date General Lee had foreshadowed his intention of using his</p>
<p>cavalry in connection with the manoeuvres of his infantry by issuing</p>
<p>an order himself, now that Stuart was dead, directing that the &quot;three</p>
<p>divisions of cavalry serving with the army [Lee&#x27;s] will constitute</p>
<p>separate commands, and will report directly to and receive orders</p>
<p>from the headquarters of the army.&quot;  The order indicates that since</p>
<p>Stuart&#x27;s death the Confederate cavalry had been re-organized into</p>
<p>three divisions, that were commanded respectively by General Wade</p>
<p>Hampton, General Fitzhugh Lee, and General W. H. F. Lee, the</p>
<p>additional division organization undoubtedly growing out of the fact,</p>
<p>that General M. C. Butler&#x27;s brigade of about four thousand men had</p>
<p>joined recently from South Carolina.</p>
<p>When this force developed in Gregg&#x27;s front, he attacked the moment</p>
<p>his troops could be dismounted; and the contest became one of</p>
<p>exceeding stubborness, for he found confronting him Hampton&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s divisions, supported by what we then supposed to be a</p>
<p>brigade of infantry, but which, it has since been ascertained, was</p>
<p>Butler&#x27;s brigade of mounted troops; part of them armed with long-</p>
<p>range rifles.  The contest between the opposing forces was of the</p>
<p>severest character and continued till late in the evening.  The</p>
<p>varying phases of the fight prompted me to reinforce Gregg as much as</p>
<p>possible, so I directed Custer&#x27;s brigade to report to him, sending,</p>
<p>meanwhile, for the other two brigades of Torbert, but these were not</p>
<p>available at the time--on account of delays which occurred in</p>
<p>relieving them from the line at Crump&#x27;s Creek--and did not get up</p>
<p>till the fight was over.  As soon as Custer joined him, Gregg</p>
<p>vigorously assaulted the Confederate position along his whole front;</p>
<p>and notwithstanding the long-range rifles of the South Carolinians,</p>
<p>who were engaging in their first severe combat it appears, and fought</p>
<p>most desperately, he penetrated their barricades at several points.</p>
<p>The most determined and obstinate efforts for success were now made</p>
<p>on both sides, as the position at Hawe&#x27;s Shop had become of very</p>
<p>great importance on account of the designs of both Lee and Grant.</p>
<p>Lee wished to hold this ground while he manoeuvred his army to the</p>
<p>line of the Tolopotomy, where he could cover the roads to Richmond,</p>
<p>while Grant, though first sending me out merely to discover by a</p>
<p>strong reconnoissance the movements of the enemy, saw the value of</p>
<p>the place to cover his new base at the White House, and also to give</p>
<p>us possession of a direct road to Cold Harbor.  Hawe&#x27;s Shop remained</p>
<p>in our possession finally, for late in the evening Custer&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>was dismounted and formed in close column in rear of Gregg, and while</p>
<p>it assaulted through an opening near the centre of his line, the</p>
<p>other two brigades advanced and carried the temporary works.  The</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s dead and many of his wounded fell into our hands; also a</p>
<p>considerable number of prisoners, from whom we learned that</p>
<p>Longstreet&#x27;s and Ewell&#x27;s corps were but four miles to the rear.</p>
<p>The battle was a decidedly severe one, the loss on each side being</p>
<p>heavy in proportion to the number of troops engaged.  This fight took</p>
<p>place almost immediately in front of our infantry, which, during the</p>
<p>latter part of the contest, was busily occupied in throwing up</p>
<p>intrenchments.  Late in the afternoon I reported to General Meade the</p>
<p>presence of the enemy&#x27;s infantry, and likewise that Hampton&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s divisions were in my front also, and asked, at the</p>
<p>same time; that some of our infantry, which was near at hand, be sent</p>
<p>to my assistance.  I could not convince Meade that anything but the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s horse was fighting us, however, and he declined to push out</p>
<p>the foot-troops, who were much wearied by night marches.  It has been</p>
<p>ascertained since that Meade&#x27;s conclusions were correct in so far as</p>
<p>they related to the enemy&#x27;s infantry; but the five cavalry brigades</p>
<p>far outnumbered my three, and it is to be regretted that so much was</p>
<p>risked in holding a point that commanded the roads to Cold Harbor and</p>
<p>Meadow bridge, when there was at hand a preponderating number of</p>
<p>Union troops which might have been put into action.  However, Gregg&#x27;s</p>
<p>division and Custer&#x27;s brigade were equal to the situation, all</p>
<p>unaided as they were till dark, when Torbert and Merritt came on the</p>
<p>ground.  The contest not only gave us the crossroads, but also</p>
<p>removed our uncertainty regarding Lee&#x27;s movements, clearly</p>
<p>demonstrating that his army was retiring by its right flank, so that</p>
<p>it might continue to interpose between Grant and the James River; as</p>
<p>well as cover the direct route to Richmond.</p>
<p>General Lee reported this battle to his Government as a Confederate</p>
<p>victory, but his despatch was sent early in the day, long before the</p>
<p>fight ended, and evidently he could not have known the final result</p>
<p>when he made the announcement, for the fight lasted until dark.</p>
<p>After dark, our own and the Confederate dead having been buried, I</p>
<p>withdrew, and moving to the rear of our infantry, marched all night</p>
<p>and till I reached the vicinity of Old Church, where I had been</p>
<p>instructed to keep a vigilant watch on the enemy with Gregg&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s divisi6ns.  As soon as I had taken position at Old Church</p>
<p>my pickets were pushed out in the direction of Cold Harbor, and the</p>
<p>fact that the enemy was holding that point in some force was clearly</p>
<p>ascertained.  But our occupation of Cold Harbor was of the utmost</p>
<p>importance; indeed, it was absolutely necessary that we should</p>
<p>possess it, to secure our communications with the White House, as</p>
<p>well as to cover the extension of our line to the left toward the</p>
<p>James River.  Roads from Bethesda Church, Old Church, and the White</p>
<p>House centred at Cold Harbor, and from there many roads diverged also</p>
<p>toward different crossings of the Chickahominy, which were</p>
<p>indispensable to us.</p>
<p>The enemy too realized the importance of the place, for as soon as he</p>
<p>found himself compelled to take up the line of the Tolopotomy he</p>
<p>threw a body of troops into Cold Harbor by forced marches, and</p>
<p>followed it up by pushing a part of this force out on the Old Church</p>
<p>road as far as Matadequin Creek, where he established a line of</p>
<p>battle, arranging the front of it parallel to the road along the</p>
<p>south bank of the Pamunkey; this for the purpose of endangering our</p>
<p>trains as they moved back and forth between the army and the White</p>
<p>House.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I had occupied Old Church and pushed pickets down toward</p>
<p>Cold Harbor.  The outposts struck each other just north of Matadequin</p>
<p>Creek, and a spirited fight immediately took place.  At first our</p>
<p>pickets were sorely pressed, but Torbert, who was already preparing</p>
<p>to make a reconnoissance, lost no time in reinforcing them on the</p>
<p>north side of the creek with Devin&#x27;s brigade.  The fight then became</p>
<p>general, both sides, dismounted, stubbornly contesting the ground.</p>
<p>Of the Confederates, General Butler&#x27;s South Carolinians bore the</p>
<p>brunt of the fight, and, strongly posted as they were on the south</p>
<p>bank of the creek, held their ground with the same obstinacy they had</p>
<p>previously shown at Hawe&#x27;s Shop.  Finally, however, Torbert threw</p>
<p>Merritt&#x27;s and Custer&#x27;s brigades into the action, and the enemy</p>
<p>retired, we pursuing to within a mile and a half of Cold Harbor and</p>
<p>capturing a number of prisoners.  Gregg&#x27;s division took no part in</p>
<p>the actual fighting, but remained near Old Church observing the roads</p>
<p>on Torberts flanks, one leading toward Bethesda Church on his right,</p>
<p>the other to his left in the direction of the White House.  This</p>
<p>latter road Gregg was particularly instructed to keep open, so as to</p>
<p>communicate with General W. F. Smith, who was then debarking his</p>
<p>corps at the White House, and on the morning of the 3ist this</p>
<p>general&#x27;s advance was covered by a brigade which Gregg had sent him</p>
<p>for the purpose.</p>
<p>Torbert having pursued toward Cold Harbor the troops he fought at</p>
<p>Matadequin Creek, had taken up a position about a mile and a half</p>
<p>from that place, on the Old Church road.  The morning of the 31st I</p>
<p>visited him to arrange for his further advance, intending thus to</p>
<p>anticipate an expected attack from Fitzhugh Lee, who was being</p>
<p>reinforced by infantry.  I met Torbert at Custer&#x27;s headquarters, and</p>
<p>found that the two had already been talking over a scheme to capture</p>
<p>Cold Harbor, and when their plan was laid before me it appeared so</p>
<p>plainly feasible that I fully endorsed it, at once giving directions</p>
<p>for its immediate execution, and ordering Gregg to come forward to</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s support with such troops as he could spare from the duty</p>
<p>with which he had been charged.</p>
<p>Torbert moved out promptly, Merritt&#x27;s brigade first, followed by</p>
<p>Custer&#x27;s, on the direct road to Cold Harbor, while Devin&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>was detached, and marched by a left-hand road that would bring him in</p>
<p>on the right and rear of the enemy&#x27;s line, which was posted in front</p>
<p>of the crossroads.  Devin was unable to carry his part of the</p>
<p>programme farther than to reach the front of the Confederate right,</p>
<p>and as Merritt came into position to the right of the Old Church road</p>
<p>Torbert was obliged to place a part of Custer&#x27;s brigade on Merritt&#x27;s</p>
<p>left so as to connect with Devin.  The whole division was now in</p>
<p>line, confronted by Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry, supported by Clingman&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade from Hoke&#x27;s division of infantry; and from the Confederate</p>
<p>breastworks, hastily constructed out of logs, rails, and earth, a</p>
<p>heavy fire was already being poured upon us that it seemed impossible</p>
<p>to withstand.  None of Gregg&#x27;s division had yet arrived, and so</p>
<p>stubborn was the enemy&#x27;s resistance that I began to doubt our ability</p>
<p>to carry the place before reinforcements came up, but just then</p>
<p>Merritt reported that he could turn the enemy&#x27;s left, and being</p>
<p>directed to execute his proposition, he carried it to a most</p>
<p>successful issue with the First and Second regular cavalry.  Just as</p>
<p>these two regiments passed around the enemy&#x27;s left and attacked his</p>
<p>rear, the remainder of the division assailed him in front.  This</p>
<p>manoeuvre of Merritt&#x27;s stampeded the Confederates, and the defenses</p>
<p>falling into our hands easily, we pushed ahead on the Bottom&#x27;s bridge</p>
<p>road three-fourths of a mile beyond Cold Harbor.</p>
<p>Cold Harbor was now mine, but I was about nine miles away from our</p>
<p>nearest infantry, and had been able to bring up only Davies&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>of cavalry, which arrived after the fight.  My isolated position</p>
<p>therefore made me a little uneasy.  I felt convinced that the enemy</p>
<p>would attempt to regain the place, for it was of as much importance</p>
<p>to him as to us, and the presence of his infantry disclosed that he</p>
<p>fully appreciated this.  My uneasiness increased as the day grew</p>
<p>late, for I had learned from prisoners that the balance of Hoke&#x27;s</p>
<p>division was en route to Cold Harbor, and Kershaw near at hand,</p>
<p>interposing between the Union left near Bethesda Church and my</p>
<p>position.  In view of this state of affairs, I notified General Meade</p>
<p>that I had taken Cold Harbor, but could not with safety to my command</p>
<p>hold it, and forthwith gave directions to withdraw during the night.</p>
<p>The last of my troops had scarcely pulled out, however, when I</p>
<p>received a despatch from Meade directing me to hold Cold Harbor at</p>
<p>every hazard.  General Grant had expected that a severe battle would</p>
<p>have to be fought before we could obtain possession of the place; and</p>
<p>its capture by our cavalry not being anticipated, no preparation had</p>
<p>been made for its permanent occupancy.  No time was to be lost,</p>
<p>therefore, if the advantages which possession of Cold Harbor gave us</p>
<p>were to be improved, so at the same hour that Meade ordered me to</p>
<p>hold the place at all hazards the Sixth Corps was started on a forced</p>
<p>march, by Grant&#x27;s directions, to aid in that object, and on arrival</p>
<p>to relieve my cavalry.</p>
<p>The moment Meade&#x27;s order was received, I directed a reoccupation of</p>
<p>Cold Harbor, and although a large portion of Torbert&#x27;s command was</p>
<p>already well on its way back to the line we held on the morning of</p>
<p>the 31st, this force speedily retraced its steps, and re-entered the</p>
<p>place before daylight; both our departure and return having been</p>
<p>effected without the enemy being aware of our movements.  We now</p>
<p>found that the temporary breastworks of rails and logs which the</p>
<p>Confederates had built were of incalculable benefit to us in</p>
<p>furnishing material with which to establish a line of defense, they</p>
<p>being made available by simply reversing them at some points, or at</p>
<p>others wholly reconstructing them to suit the circumstances of the</p>
<p>ground: The troops, without reserves, were then placed behind our</p>
<p>cover dismounted, boxes of ammunition distributed along the line, and</p>
<p>the order passed along that the place must be held.  All this was</p>
<p>done in the darkness, and while we were working away at our cover the</p>
<p>enemy could be distinctly heard from our skirmish-line giving</p>
<p>commands and making preparations to attack.</p>
<p>Just after daylight on the 1st of June the Confederate infantry under</p>
<p>General Kershaw endeavored to drive us out, advancing against my</p>
<p>right from the Bethesda Church road.  In his assault he was permitted</p>
<p>to come close up to our works, and when within short range such afire</p>
<p>was opened on him from our horse-artillery and repeating carbines</p>
<p>that he recoiled in confusion after the first onset; still, he seemed</p>
<p>determined to get the place, and after reorganizing, again attacked;</p>
<p>but the lesson of the first repulse was not without effect, and his</p>
<p>feeble effort proved wholly fruitless.  After his second failure we</p>
<p>were left undisturbed, and at 9 A.M. I sent the following despatch to</p>
<p>army headquarters:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,</p>
<p>&quot;ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.</p>
<p>&quot;Cold Harbor, Va., June 1, 1864--9 A.M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL HUMPHREYS,</p>
<p>&quot;Chief-of-Staff.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL: In obedience to your instructions I am holding Cold Harbor.</p>
<p>I have captured this morning more prisoners; they belong to three</p>
<p>different infantry brigades.  The enemy assaulted the right of my</p>
<p>lines this morning, but were handsomely repulsed.  I have been very</p>
<p>apprehensive, but General Wright is now coming up.  I built slight</p>
<p>works for my men; the enemy came up to them, and were driven back.</p>
<p>General Wright has just arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General Commanding.&quot;</p>
<p>About 10 o&#x27;clock in the morning the Sixth Corps relieved Torbert and</p>
<p>Davies, having marched all night, and these two generals moving out</p>
<p>toward the Chickahominy covered the left of the infantry line till</p>
<p>Hancock&#x27;s corps took their place in the afternoon.  By this time</p>
<p>Gregg had joined me with his two brigades, and both Torbert and Gregg</p>
<p>were now marched to Prospect Church, from which point I moved them to</p>
<p>a position on the north side of the Chickahominy at Bottom&#x27;s bridge.</p>
<p>Here the enemy&#x27;s cavalry confronted us, occupying the south bank of</p>
<p>the stream, with artillery in position at the fords prepared to</p>
<p>dispute our passage; but it was not intended that we should cross; so</p>
<p>Gregg and Torbert lay quiet in camp at Bottom&#x27;s bridge and at Old</p>
<p>Church without noteworthy event until the 6th of June.</p>
<p>As before related, Wilson&#x27;s division struck the enemy&#x27;s infantry as</p>
<p>well as W. H. F. Lee&#x27;s cavalry near Ashland on the 1st of June, and</p>
<p>although Chapman destroyed the bridges over the South Anna, which was</p>
<p>his part of the programme, Wilson found it necessary to return to</p>
<p>Price&#x27;s Store.  From this point he continued to cover the right of</p>
<p>the Army of the Potomac, on the 2d of June driving the rear-guard of</p>
<p>the enemy from Hawe&#x27;s Shop, the scene of the battle of May 28.  The</p>
<p>same day he crossed Tolopotomy Creek, and passed around the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>left flank so far that Lee thought his left was turned by a strong</p>
<p>force, and under cover of darkness withdrew from a menacing position</p>
<p>which he was holding in front of the Ninth Corps.  This successful</p>
<p>manoeuvre completed, Wilson returned to Hawe&#x27;s Shop, and on the 4th</p>
<p>went into camp at New Castle ferry, in anticipation of certain</p>
<p>operations of the Cavalry Corps, which were to take place while the</p>
<p>Army of the Potomac was crossing to the south side of the James.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>
<p>THE MOVEMENT TO THE JAMES--THE SECOND EXPEDITION--BATTLE OF</p>
<p>TREVILLIAN STATION--DEFEAT OF GENERAL WADE HAMPTON--MALLORY&#x27;S</p>
<p>CROSSROADS--SUFFERING OF THE WOUNDED--SECURING THE TRAINS--GENERAL</p>
<p>GREGG&#x27;S STUBBORN FIGHT.</p>
<p>By the 6th of June General Grant again determined to continue the</p>
<p>movement of the army by its left flank to the south bank of the James</p>
<p>River, his unsuccessful attack on the enemy&#x27;s works near Cold Harbor</p>
<p>having demonstrated that Lee&#x27;s position north of the Chickahominy</p>
<p>could not be carried by assault with results that would compensate</p>
<p>for the enormous loss of life which must follow; therefore a further</p>
<p>attempt to fight a decisive battle north of Richmond was abandoned.</p>
<p>In carrying the army to the James River the hazardous manoeuvres</p>
<p>would be hampered by many obstacles, such as the thick timber,</p>
<p>underbrush, and troublesome swamps to be met in crossing the</p>
<p>Chickahominy.  Besides, Lee held an interior line, from which all the</p>
<p>direct roads to Richmond could be covered with his infantry, leaving</p>
<p>his cavalry free to confront our advance on the south bank of the</p>
<p>Chickahominy as far down as Jones&#x27;s bridge, and thence around to</p>
<p>Charles City Court House.  In view of these difficulties it became</p>
<p>necessary to draw off the bulk of the enemy&#x27;s cavalry while the</p>
<p>movement to the James was in process of execution, and General Meade</p>
<p>determined to do this by requiring me to proceed with two divisions</p>
<p>as far as Charlottesville to destroy the railroad bridge over the</p>
<p>Rivanna River near that town, the railroad itself from the Rivanna to</p>
<p>Gordonsville, and, if practicable, from Gordonsville back toward</p>
<p>Hanover Junction also.</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,</p>
<p>&quot;June 5, 1864.  3.30 P. M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Commanding Cavalry Corps.</p>
<p>&quot;I am directed by the major-general commanding to furnish the</p>
<p>following instructions for your guidance in the execution of the duty</p>
<p>referred to in the order for movements and changes of position to-</p>
<p>night, a copy of which order accompanies this communication.</p>
<p>&quot;With two divisions of your corps you will move on the morning of the</p>
<p>7th instant to Charlottesville and destroy the railroad bridge over</p>
<p>the Rivanna near that town; you will then thoroughly destroy the</p>
<p>railroad from that point to Gordonsville, and from Gordonsville</p>
<p>toward Hanover Junction, and to the latter point, if practicable.</p>
<p>The chief engineer, Major Duane, will furnish you a canvas pontoon-</p>
<p>train of eight boats.  The chief quartermaster will supply you with</p>
<p>such tools, implements, and materials as you may require for the</p>
<p>destruction of the road.  Upon the completion of this duty you will</p>
<p>rejoin this army.</p>
<p>&quot;A. HUMPHREYS,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.&quot;</p>
<p>After Meade&#x27;s instructions reached me they were somewhat modified by</p>
<p>General Grant, who on the same evening had received information that</p>
<p>General Hunter, commanding the troops in West Virginia, had reached</p>
<p>Staunton and engaged with advantage the Confederate commander,</p>
<p>General Jones, near that place.  General Grant informed me orally</p>
<p>that he had directed Hunter to advance as far as Charlottesville,</p>
<p>that he expected me to unite with him there, and that the two</p>
<p>commands, after destroying the James River canal and the Virginia</p>
<p>Central road, were to join the Army of the Potomac in the manner</p>
<p>contemplated in my instructions from General Meade; and that in view</p>
<p>of what was anticipated, it would be well to break up as much of the</p>
<p>railroad as possible on my way westward.  A copy of his letter to</p>
<p>Hunter comprised my written instructions.  A junction with this</p>
<p>general was not contemplated when the expedition was first conceived,</p>
<p>but became an important though not the paramount object after the</p>
<p>reception of the later information.  The diversion of the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry from the south side of the Chickahominy was its main purpose,</p>
<p>for in the presence of such a force as Lee&#x27;s contracted lines would</p>
<p>now permit him to concentrate behind the Chickahominy, the</p>
<p>difficulties of crossing that stream would be largely increased if he</p>
<p>also had at hand a strong body of horse, to gain the time necessary</p>
<p>for him to oppose the movement at the different crossings with masses</p>
<p>of his infantry.</p>
<p>The order calling for two divisions for the expedition, I decided to</p>
<p>take Gregg&#x27;s and Torbert&#x27;s, leaving Wilson&#x27;s behind to continue with</p>
<p>the infantry in its march to the James and to receive instructions</p>
<p>directly from, the headquarters of the army.  All my dismounted men</p>
<p>had been sent to the White House some days before, and they were</p>
<p>directed to report to Wilson as they could be provided with mounts.</p>
<p>&quot;COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1964.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER, Commanding Dept West Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;General Sheridan leaves here to-morrow morning with instructions to</p>
<p>proceed to Charlottesville, Va., and to commence there the</p>
<p>destruction of the Virginia Central railroad, destroying this way as</p>
<p>much as possible.  The complete destruction of this road and of the</p>
<p>canal on James River is of great importance to us.  According to the</p>
<p>instructions I sent to General Halleck for your guidance, you will</p>
<p>proceed to Lynchburg and commence there.  It would be of great value</p>
<p>to us to get possession of Lynchburg for a single day.  But that</p>
<p>point is of so much importance to the enemy, that in attempting to</p>
<p>get it such resistance may be met as to defeat your getting into the</p>
<p>road or canal at all.  I see, in looking over the letter to General</p>
<p>Halleck on the subject of your instructions, that it rather indicates</p>
<p>that your route should be from Staunton via Charlottesville.  If you</p>
<p>have so understood it, you will be doing just what I want.  The</p>
<p>direction I would now give is, that if this letter reaches you in the</p>
<p>valley between Staunton and Lynchburg, you immediately turn east by</p>
<p>the most practicable road until you strike the Lynchburg branch of</p>
<p>the Virginia Central road.  From there move eastward along the line</p>
<p>of the road, destroying it completely and thoroughly, until you join</p>
<p>General Sheridan.  After the work laid out for General Sheridan and</p>
<p>yourself is thoroughly done, proceed to join the Army of the Potomac</p>
<p>by the route laid out in General Sheridan&#x27;s instructions.  If any</p>
<p>portion of your force, especially your cavalry, is needed back in</p>
<p>your department, you are authorized to send it back.  If on receipt</p>
<p>of this you should be near to Lynchburg and deem it practicable to</p>
<p>reach that point, you will exercise your judgment about going there.</p>
<p>If you should be on the railroad between Charlottesville and</p>
<p>Lynchburg, it may be practicable to detach a cavalry force to destroy</p>
<p>the canal.  Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>Owing to the hard service of the preceding month we had lost many</p>
<p>horses, so the number of dismounted men was large; and my strength</p>
<p>had also been much reduced by killed and wounded during the same</p>
<p>period of activity.  The effective mounted force of my two divisions</p>
<p>was therefore much diminished, they mustering only about six thousand</p>
<p>officers and men when concentrated on June 6 at New Castle ferry.</p>
<p>Here they were provided with three days&#x27; rations, intended to last</p>
<p>five days, and with two days&#x27; grain for the horses.  The rations and</p>
<p>forty rounds of ammunition per man were to be carried on the persons</p>
<p>of the troopers, the grain on the pommel of the saddle, and the</p>
<p>reserve ammunition in wagons.  One medical wagon and eight ambulances</p>
<p>were also furnished, and one wagon was authorized for each division</p>
<p>and brigade headquarters; enough canvas-covered boats for a small</p>
<p>pontoon-bridge were also provided.</p>
<p>My instructions permitting latitude in the route I should take, I</p>
<p>decided to march along the north bank of the North Anna River, cross</p>
<p>that stream at Carpenter&#x27;s ford, strike the Virginia Central railroad</p>
<p>at Trevillian Station, destroy it toward Louisa Court House, march</p>
<p>past Gordonsville, strike the railroad again at Cobham&#x27;s Station, and</p>
<p>destroy it thence to Charlottesville as we proceeded west.  The</p>
<p>success of the last part of this programme would of course depend on</p>
<p>the location of General Hunter when I should arrive in the region</p>
<p>where it would be practicable for us to communicate with each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From my camp at New Castle ferry we crossed the Pamunkey, marched</p>
</blockquote>
<p>between Aylett&#x27;s and Dunkirk on the Mattapony River, and on the 8th</p>
<p>of June encamped at Polecat Station.  The next day we resumed the</p>
<p>march along the North Anna--our advance guard skirmishing with a few</p>
<p>mounted men of the enemy, who proved to be irregulars--and bivouacked</p>
<p>on Northeast Creek, near Young&#x27;s Mills.  This day I learned from some</p>
<p>of these irregulars whom we made prisoners that Breckenridge&#x27;s</p>
<p>division of infantry, en route to the Shenandoah Valley by way of</p>
<p>Gordonsville, was passing slowly up the railroad parallel to me, and</p>
<p>that the enemy&#x27;s cavalry had left its position on the south side of</p>
<p>the Chickahominy, and was marching on the old Richmond and</p>
<p>Gordonsville road toward Gordonsville, under command of General Wade</p>
<p>Hampton, the information being confirmed by a scouting party sent out</p>
<p>to cut the telegraph wires along the railroad in the night.</p>
<p>Breckenridge had been ordered back to the valley by General Lee as</p>
<p>soon as he heard of Hunter&#x27;s victory near Staunton, but now that my</p>
<p>expedition had been discovered, the movement of Breckenridge&#x27;s troops</p>
<p>on the railroad was being timed to correspond with the marches of my</p>
<p>command till Hampton could get more nearly parallel with me.</p>
<p>On the 10th we resumed the march, passing by Twyman&#x27;s store, crossing</p>
<p>the North Anna at Carpenter&#x27;s ford and encamping on the road leading</p>
<p>along the south fork of the North Anna to Trevillian Station.  During</p>
<p>the evening and night of the Loth the boldness of the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>scouting parties, with which we had been coming into collision more</p>
<p>or less every day, perceptibly increased, thus indicating the</p>
<p>presence of a large force, and evidencing that his shorter line of</p>
<p>march had enabled him to bring to my front a strong body of cavalry,</p>
<p>although it started from Lee&#x27;s army nearly two days later than I did</p>
<p>from Grant&#x27;s.  The arrival of this body also permitted Breckenridge</p>
<p>to pass on to Gordonsville, and from there to interpose between</p>
<p>General Hunter and me at either Charlottesville or Waynesboro&#x27; as</p>
<p>circumstances might determine.</p>
<p>On the night of the Loth General Hampton&#x27;s division camped about</p>
<p>three miles northwest of Trevillian, at a place called Green Spring</p>
<p>Valley and Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s division not far from Louisa Court House,</p>
<p>some six miles east of Trevillian.  Learning that I was at</p>
<p>Carpenter&#x27;s ford, Hampton marched his division by way of Trevillian</p>
<p>Station toward Clayton&#x27;s store, on the road from Trevillian to</p>
<p>Carpenter&#x27;s ford, intending to attack me at Clayton&#x27;s.  Fitzhugh</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s division was to join Hampton at Clayton&#x27;s store from Louisa</p>
<p>Court House; but on the morning of the 11th the two generals were</p>
<p>separated by several miles.</p>
<p>At daylight of the 11th my march, to Trevillian Station was resumed</p>
<p>on the direct road to that point, and engaging the enemy&#x27;s pickets</p>
<p>and advanced parties soon after setting out, we began to drive them</p>
<p>in.  Torbert had the lead with Merritt&#x27;s and Devin&#x27;s brigades, and as</p>
<p>he pressed back the pickets he came upon the enemy posted behind a</p>
<p>line of barricades in dense timber about three miles from Trevillian.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Custer&#x27;s brigade had been sent from where we bivouacked, by</p>
<p>a wood road found on our left, to destroy Trevillian Station.  In</p>
<p>following this road Custer got to the rear of Hampton&#x27;s division,</p>
<p>having passed between its right flank and Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s division,</p>
<p>which was at the time marching on the road leading from Louisa Court</p>
<p>House to Clayton&#x27;s store to unite with Hampton.</p>
<p>Custer, the moment he found himself in Hampton&#x27;s rear, charged the</p>
<p>led horses, wagons, and caissons found there, getting hold of a vast</p>
<p>number of each, and also of the station itself.  The stampede and</p>
<p>havoc wrought by Custer in Hampton&#x27;s rear compelled him to turn</p>
<p>Rosser&#x27;s brigade in that direction, and while it attacked Custer on</p>
<p>one side, Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s division, which had followed Custer toward</p>
<p>Trevillian, attacked him on the other.  There then ensued a desperate</p>
<p>struggle for the possession of the captured property, resulting</p>
<p>finally in its being retaken by the enemy.  Indeed, the great number</p>
<p>of horses and vehicles could not be kept on the limited space within</p>
<p>Custer&#x27;s line, which now formed almost a complete circle; and while</p>
<p>he was endeavoring to remove them to a secure place they, together</p>
<p>with Custer&#x27;s headquarters wagon and four of his caissons, fell into</p>
<p>the hands of their original owners.</p>
<p>As soon as the firing told that Custer had struck the enemy&#x27;s rear, I</p>
<p>directed Torbert to press the line in front of Merritt and Devin,</p>
<p>aided by one brigade of Gregg&#x27;s division on their left, Gregg&#x27;s other</p>
<p>brigade in the meantime attacking Fitzhugh Lee on the Louisa Court</p>
<p>House road.  The effect of this was to force Hampton back, and his</p>
<p>division was so hard pushed that a portion of it was driven pell-mell</p>
<p>into Custer&#x27;s lines, leaving there about five hundred prisoners.  The</p>
<p>rest of Hampton&#x27;s men did not rally till they got some distance west</p>
<p>of Trevillian, while, in the meantime, Gregg had driven Fitzhugh Lee</p>
<p>toward Louisa Court House so far that many miles now intervened</p>
<p>between the two Confederate divisions, precluding their union until</p>
<p>about noon the next day, when Fitzhugh Lee effected the junction</p>
<p>after a circuitous march in the night.  The defeat of Hampton at the</p>
<p>point where he had determined to resist my further advance, and his</p>
<p>retreat westward, gave me undisturbed possession of the station; and</p>
<p>after destroying the railroad to some extent toward Gordonsville, I</p>
<p>went into camp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From prisoners taken during the day, I gathered that General Hunter,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>instead of coming toward Charlottesville, as I had reason to expect,</p>
<p>both from the instructions given me and the directions sent him by</p>
<p>General Grant, was in the neighborhood of Lexington--apparently</p>
<p>moving on Lynchburg--and that Breckenridge was at Gordonsville and</p>
<p>Charlottesville.  I also heard, from the same source, that Ewell&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps was on its way to Lynchburg, but this intelligence proved</p>
<p>afterward to be incorrect, for these troops, commanded by General</p>
<p>Early, did not leave Richmond till two days later.</p>
<p>There was no doubt as to the information about Hunter&#x27;s general</p>
<p>location, however.  He was marching toward Lynchburg, away from</p>
<p>instead of toward me, thus making the junction of our commands beyond</p>
<p>all reasonable probability.  So in view of this, I made up my mind to</p>
<p>abandon that part of the scheme, and to return by leisurely marches,</p>
<p>which would keep Hampton&#x27;s cavalry away from Lee while Grant was</p>
<p>crossing the James River.  I was still further influenced to this</p>
<p>course by the burden which was thrown on me in the large number of</p>
<p>wounded--there being about five hundred cases of my own--and the five</p>
<p>hundred prisoners that I would probably be forced to abandon, should</p>
<p>I proceed farther.  Besides, the recent battle had reduced my supply</p>
<p>of ammunition to a very small amount--not more than enough for one</p>
<p>more respectable engagement; and as the chances were that I would</p>
<p>have to fight a great deal before I could reach Hunter, now that the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s cavalry and Breckenridge&#x27;s infantry were between us, the</p>
<p>risks of the undertaking seemed too great to warrant it.</p>
<p>The morning of June 12 Gregg&#x27;s division commenced destroying the</p>
<p>railroad to Louisa Court House, and continued the work during the</p>
<p>day, breaking it pretty effectually.  While Gregg was thus occupied,</p>
<p>I directed Torbert to make a reconnoissance up the Gordonsville road,</p>
<p>to secure a by-road leading over Mallory&#x27;s ford, on the North Anna,</p>
<p>to the Catharpen road, as I purposed following that route to</p>
<p>Spottsylvania Court House on my return, and thence via Bowling Green</p>
<p>and Dunkirk to the White House.  About a mile beyond Trevillian the</p>
<p>Gordonsville road fork--the left fork leading to Charlottesville--and</p>
<p>about a mile beyond the fork Hampton had taken up and strongly</p>
<p>intrenched a line across both roads, being reinforced by Fitzhugh</p>
<p>Lee, who, as before related, had joined him about noon by a</p>
<p>roundabout march.  Torbert soon hotly engaged this line, and by the</p>
<p>impetuosity of his first attack, gained some advantage; but the</p>
<p>appearance of Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s troops on the right, and Hampton&#x27;s</p>
<p>strong resistance in front, rendered futile all efforts to carry the</p>
<p>position; and, although I brought up one of Gregg&#x27;s brigades to</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s assistance, yet the by-road I coveted was still held by the</p>
<p>enemy when night closed in.</p>
<p>This engagement, like that off the day before around Trevillian, was</p>
<p>mostly fought dismounted by both sides, as had also been the earlier</p>
<p>fights of the cavalry during the summer in the Wilderness, at Todd&#x27;s</p>
<p>Tavern, Hawe&#x27;s Shop, and Matadequin Creek.  Indeed, they could hardly</p>
<p>have been fought otherwise than on foot, as there was little chance</p>
<p>for mounted fighting in eastern Virginia, the dense woods, the</p>
<p>armament of both parties, and the practice of barricading making it</p>
<p>impracticable to use the sabre with anything like a large force; and</p>
<p>so with the exception of Yellow Tavern the dismounted method</p>
<p>prevailed in almost every engagement.</p>
<p>The losses at Mallory&#x27;s Crossroads were very heavy on both sides.</p>
<p>The character of the fighting, together with the day&#x27;s results,</p>
<p>demonstrated that it was impossible to make the passage of the North</p>
<p>Anna at Mallory&#x27;s ford without venturing another battle the next day.</p>
<p>This would consume the little ammunition left, and though we might</p>
<p>gain the road, yet the possibility of having no ammunition whatever</p>
<p>to get back with was too great a hazard, so I gave orders to withdraw</p>
<p>during the night of the 12th.  We retired along the same road by</p>
<p>which we had come, taking with us the prisoners, and all of our</p>
<p>wounded who could be moved.  Those who could not be transported, some</p>
<p>ninety in number, and all the Confederate wounded in my hands, were</p>
<p>left at Trevillian in hospitals, under charge of one of our surgeons,</p>
<p>with plenty of medical and other stores.</p>
<p>We recrossed the North Anna at Carpenter&#x27;s ford the following</p>
<p>morning, and halting there, unsaddled and turned the horses out to</p>
<p>graze, for they were nearly famished, having had neither food nor</p>
<p>water during the preceding forty-eight hours.  Late in the afternoon</p>
<p>we saddled up and proceeded to Twyman&#x27;s Store, while General</p>
<p>Hampton&#x27;s main body moved down the south bank of the North Anna, with</p>
<p>the purpose of intervening between me and the Army of the Potomac, in</p>
<p>the hope of preventing my return to it; but his movements took no</p>
<p>definite shape beyond watching me, however, till several days later,</p>
<p>near St. Mary&#x27;s Church, when I was crossing the peninsula to the</p>
<p>James River.</p>
<p>On the 14th the march was continued, and we reached the Catharpen</p>
<p>road, upon which it was originally intended to move if we had been</p>
<p>able to cross at Mallory&#x27;s ford, and this conducted me to Shady Grove</p>
<p>Church.  The next day we passed over the battle-field of</p>
<p>Spottsylvania Court House.  The marks of the recent conflicts about</p>
<p>there were visible on every hand, and in the neighboring houses were</p>
<p>found many Union and Confederate wounded, who had been too severely</p>
<p>hurt to be removed from the field-hospitals at the time of the</p>
<p>battles.  Such of our wounded as were able to travel were brought</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>On the 16th I marched from Edge Hill on the Ta River through Bowling</p>
<p>Green to Dr. Butler&#x27;s, on the north side of the Mattapony.  When I</p>
<p>arrived here I was unable to ascertain the position of the Army of</p>
<p>the Potomac, and was uncertain whether or not the base at the White</p>
<p>House had been discontinued.  I had heard nothing from the army for</p>
<p>nine days except rumors through Southern sources, and under these</p>
<p>circumstances did not like to venture between the Mattapony and</p>
<p>Pamunkey rivers, embarrassed as I was with some four hundred wounded,</p>
<p>five hundred prisoners, and about two thousand negroes that had</p>
<p>joined my column in the hope of obtaining their freedom.  I therefore</p>
<p>determined to push down the north bank of the Mattapony far enough to</p>
<p>enable me to send these impediments directly to West Point, where I</p>
<p>anticipated finding some of our gunboats and transports, that could</p>
<p>carry all to the North.  Following this plan, we proceeded through</p>
<p>Walkerton to King and Queen Court House, and bivouacked in its</p>
<p>vicinity the night of the 18th.  Next day I learned that the depot at</p>
<p>the White House had not yet been broken up entirely, and that</p>
<p>supplies were in store for me there; so after sending the wounded,</p>
<p>prisoners, and negroes to West Point under an escort of two</p>
<p>regiments, I turned back to Dunkirk, on the Mattapony, and crossed to</p>
<p>the south side at a place where the stream was narrow enough to</p>
<p>bridge with my pontoon-boats.</p>
<p>In returning from Trevillian, as the most of our wounded were hauled</p>
<p>in old buggies, carts, and such other vehicles as could be made</p>
<p>available in the absence of a sufficient number of ambulances, the</p>
<p>suffering was intense, the heat of the season and dusty roads adding</p>
<p>much to the discomfort.  Each day we halted many times to dress the</p>
<p>wounds of the injured and to refresh them as much as possible, but</p>
<p>our means for mitigating their distress were limited.  The fortitude</p>
<p>and cheerfulness of the poor fellows under such conditions were</p>
<p>remarkable, for no word of complaint was heard.  The Confederate</p>
<p>prisoners and colored people being on foot, our marches were</p>
<p>necessarily made short, and with frequent halts also, but they too</p>
<p>suffered considerably from the heat and dust, though at times the</p>
<p>prisoners were relieved by being mounted on the horses of some of our</p>
<p>regiments, the owners meantime marching on foot.  Where all the</p>
<p>colored people came from and what started them was inexplicable, but</p>
<p>they began joining us just before we reached Trevillian--men, women,</p>
<p>and children with bundles of all sorts containing their few worldly</p>
<p>goods, and the number increased from day to day until they arrived at</p>
<p>West Point.  Probably not one of the poor things had the remotest</p>
<p>idea, when he set out, as to where he would finally land, but to a</p>
<p>man they followed the Yankees in full faith that they would lead to</p>
<p>freedom, no matter what road they took.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th, at an early hour, we resumed our march,</p>
<p>and as the column proceeded sounds of artillery were heard in the</p>
<p>direction of the White House, which fact caused us to quicken the</p>
<p>pace.  We had not gone far when despatches from General Abercrombie,</p>
<p>commanding some fragmentary organizations at the White House,</p>
<p>notified me that the place was about to be attacked.  I had</p>
<p>previously sent an advance party with orders to move swiftly toward</p>
<p>the cannonading and report to me by couriers the actual condition of</p>
<p>affairs.  From this party I soon learned that there was no occasion</p>
<p>to push our jaded animals, since the crisis, if there had been one,</p>
<p>was over and the enemy repulsed, so the increased gait was reduced to</p>
<p>a leisurely march that took us late in the afternoon to the north</p>
<p>bank of the Pamunkey, opposite Abercrombie&#x27;s camp.  When I got to the</p>
<p>river the enemy was holding the bluffs surrounding the White House</p>
<p>farm, having made no effort to penetrate General Abercrombie&#x27;s line</p>
<p>or do him other hurt than to throw a few shells among the teamsters</p>
<p>there congregated.</p>
<p>Next day Gregg&#x27;s division crossed the Pamunkey dismounted, and</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s crossed mounted. As soon as the troops were over, Gregg,</p>
<p>supported by Merritt&#x27;s brigade, moved out on the road to Tunstall&#x27;s</p>
<p>Station to attack Hampton, posted an the west side of Black Creek,</p>
<p>Custer&#x27;s brigade meanwhile moving, mounted, on the road to</p>
<p>Cumberland, and Devin&#x27;s in like manner on the one to Baltimore</p>
<p>crossroads.  This offer of battle was not accepted, however, and</p>
<p>Hampton withdrew from my front, retiring behind the Chickahominy,</p>
<p>where his communications with Lee would be more secure.</p>
<p>While at the White House I received orders to break up that depot</p>
<p>wholly, and also instructions to move the trains which the Army of</p>
<p>the Potomac had left there across the peninsula to the pontoon-bridge</p>
<p>at Deep Bottom on the James River.  These trains amounted to hundreds</p>
<p>of wagons and other vehicles, and knowing full well the dangers which</p>
<p>would attend the difficult problem of getting them over to</p>
<p>Petersburg, I decided to start them with as little delay as</p>
<p>circumstances would permit, and the morning of the 22d sent Torbert&#x27;s</p>
<p>division ahead to secure Jones&#x27;s bridge on the Chickahominy, so that</p>
<p>the wagons could be crossed at that point.  The trains followed</p>
<p>Torbert, while Gregg&#x27;s division marched by a road parallel to the one</p>
<p>on which the wagons were moving, and on their right flank, as they</p>
<p>needed to be covered and protected in that direction only.</p>
<p>The enemy made no effort to attack us while we were moving the trains</p>
<p>that day, and the wagons were all safely parked for the night on the</p>
<p>south side of the Chickahominy, guarded by General Getty, who had</p>
<p>relieved Abercrombie from command of the infantry fragments before we</p>
<p>started off from the White House.</p>
<p>To secure the crossing at Jones&#x27;s bridge, Torbert had pushed Devin&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade out on the Long Bridge road, on the side of the Chickahominy</p>
<p>where, on the morning of the 23d, he was attacked by Chambliss&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigade of W. H. F. Lee&#x27;s division.  Devin was driven in some little</p>
<p>distance, but being reinforced by Getty with six companies of colored</p>
<p>troops, he quickly turned the tables on Chambliss and re-established</p>
<p>his picketposts.  From this affair I learned that Chambliss&#x27;s brigade</p>
<p>was the advance of the Confederate cavalry corps, while Hampton</p>
<p>discovered from it that we were already in possession of the Jones&#x27;s</p>
<p>bridge crossing of the Chickahominy; and as he was too late to</p>
<p>challenge our passage of the stream at this point he contented</p>
<p>himself with taking up a position that night so as to cover the roads</p>
<p>leading from Long Bridge to Westover, with the purpose of preventing</p>
<p>the trains from following the river road to the pontoon-bridge at</p>
<p>Deep Bottom.</p>
<p>My instructions required me to cross the trains over the James River</p>
<p>on this pontoon-bridge if practicable, and to reach it I should be</p>
<p>obliged to march through Charles City Court House, and then by</p>
<p>Harrison&#x27;s Landing and Malvern Hill, the latter point being held by</p>
<p>the enemy.  In fact, he held all the ground between Long Bridge on</p>
<p>the Chickahominy and the pontoon-bridge except the Tete de pont at</p>
<p>the crossing.  Notwithstanding this I concluded to make the attempt,</p>
<p>for all the delays of ferrying the command and trains would be</p>
<p>avoided if we got through to the bridge; and with this object in view</p>
<p>I moved Torbert&#x27;s division out on the Charles City road to conduct</p>
<p>the wagons.  Just beyond Charles City Court House Torbert encountered</p>
<p>Lomax&#x27;s brigade, which he drove across Herring Creek on the road to</p>
<p>Westover Church; and reporting the affair to me, I surmised, from the</p>
<p>presence of this force in my front, that Hampton would endeavor to</p>
<p>penetrate to the long column of wagons, so I ordered them to go into</p>
<p>park near Wilcox&#x27;s landing, and instructed Gregg, whose division had</p>
<p>been marching in the morning along the road leading from Jones&#x27;s</p>
<p>bridge to St.  Mary&#x27;s Church for the purpose of covering the exposed</p>
<p>flank of the train, to hold fast near the church without fail till</p>
<p>all the transportation had passed Charles City Court House.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, General Hampton, who had conjectured that I would try to</p>
<p>get the train across the James by the pontoonbridge at Deep Bottom,</p>
<p>began concentrating all his troops except Lomax&#x27;s brigade, which was</p>
<p>to confront the head of my column on the river road, in the vicinity</p>
<p>of Nance&#x27;s Shop.  This was discovered by Gregg at an early hour, and</p>
<p>divining this purpose he had prepared to meet it by constructing</p>
<p>hasty cover for his men before receiving my instructions.  About 4</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock in the afternoon Hampton got his force in hand, and with</p>
<p>Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s division assailed the whole front of Gregg&#x27;s line, and</p>
<p>his left flank with Chambliss&#x27;s and Geary&#x27;s brigades.  For two hours</p>
<p>he continued to attack, but made little impression on Gregg--gain at</p>
<p>one point being counterbalanced by failure at another.  Because of</p>
<p>the evident strength of Hampton, Gregg had placed all his troops in</p>
<p>line of battle from the first, and on discovery of the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>superior numbers sent message after message to me concerning the</p>
<p>situation, but the messengers never arrived, being either killed or</p>
<p>captured, and I remained in total ignorance till dark of the strait</p>
<p>his division was in.</p>
<p>Toward night it became clear to Gregg that he could maintain the</p>
<p>unequal contest no longer, and he then decided to retreat, but not</p>
<p>until convinced that the time won had enabled all the trains to pass</p>
<p>Charles City Court House in safety.  When he had got all his led</p>
<p>horses fairly on the way, and such of the wounded as could be</p>
<p>transported, he retired by his right flank-in some confusion, it is</p>
<p>true, but stubbornly resisting to Hopewell Church, where Hampton</p>
<p>ceased to press him.</p>
<p>Gregg&#x27;s losses were heavy, and he was forced to abandon his dead and</p>
<p>most seriously wounded, but the creditable stand made ensured the</p>
<p>safety of the train, the last wagon of which was now parked at</p>
<p>Wilcox&#x27;s Landing.  His steady, unflinching determination to gain time</p>
<p>for the wagons to get beyond the point of danger was characteristic</p>
<p>of the man, and this was the third occasion on which he had exhibited</p>
<p>a high order of capacity and sound judgment since coming under my</p>
<p>command.  The firmness and coolness with which he always met the</p>
<p>responsibilities of a dangerous place were particularly strong points</p>
<p>in Gregg&#x27;s make-up, and he possessed so much professional though</p>
<p>unpretentious ability, that it is to be regretted he felt obliged a</p>
<p>few months later to quit the service before the close of the war.</p>
<p>Gregg&#x27;s fight fully satisfied me that we could not get the trains up</p>
<p>to the pontoon-bridge, for of course Hampton would now throw all his</p>
<p>cavalry in my front, on the river road, where it could be backed up</p>
<p>by Lee&#x27;s infantry.  Meanwhile, General Meade had become assured of</p>
<p>the same thing, and as he was now growing anxious about the fate of</p>
<p>Wilson&#x27;s division--which, during my absence, had been sent out to</p>
<p>break the enemy&#x27;s communications south of Petersburg, by destroying</p>
<p>the Southside and Danville railroads--he sent ferryboats to cross me</p>
<p>over the James.  During the night&#x27;of the 24th, and next morning, the</p>
<p>immense train--which ought never to have been left for the cavalry to</p>
<p>escort, after a fatiguing expedition of three weeks--was moved back</p>
<p>through Charles City Court House to Douthard&#x27;s landing, and there</p>
<p>ferried over the river, followed by my troops in like manner.  When</p>
<p>General Hampton discovered this, he moved to Drury&#x27;s Bluff, and</p>
<p>there, on the morning of the 27th, crossed the James by the</p>
<p>Confederate pontoon-bridge.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>
<p>GENERAL WILSON&#x27;S RAID--DESTROYING RAILROADS--HIS DISCOMFITURE--</p>
<p>RESULTS OF HIS RAID--REMOUNTS--MOVEMENT TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE</p>
<p>JAMES--DECEIVING LEE--MY ISOLATED POSITION--ESTIMATE OF HANCOCK--</p>
<p>SUCCESS OF THE CAVALRY--THEIR CONSTANT DUTIES.</p>
<p>While I was absent on the expedition to Trevillian, the movement of</p>
<p>the Army of the Potomac across the James River was effected, and</p>
<p>Wilson, whom I had left behind for the purpose, was engaged in the</p>
<p>duty of covering its front and rear.  Late on the night of June 12</p>
<p>he, with Chapman&#x27;s brigade, crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge,</p>
<p>in advance of the Fifth Corps, and by 7 o&#x27;clock next morning had</p>
<p>driven the enemy&#x27;s pickets up to White Oak bridge, where he waited</p>
<p>for our infantry.  When that came up, he pushed on as far as Riddle&#x27;s</p>
<p>Shop, but late that evening the Confederate infantry forced him to</p>
<p>withdraw to St. Mary&#x27;s Church; for early in the morning General Lee</p>
<p>had discovered the movement of our army, and promptly threw this</p>
<p>column of infantry south of the Chickahominy to White Oak Swamp, with</p>
<p>the design of covering Richmond.  From St. Mary&#x27;s Church Wilson</p>
<p>guarded all the roads toward White Oak Swamp and Riddle&#x27;s Shop,</p>
<p>McIntosh&#x27;s brigade joining him on the 14th, by way of Long Bridge, as</p>
<p>the rear of the Army of the Potomac passed the Chickahominy.  In the</p>
<p>performance of this duty Wilson did not have to fight any engagement</p>
<p>of magnitude, for the bulk of the enemy&#x27;s cavalry had followed me to</p>
<p>Trevillian.  During the 15th and 16th Wilson drew his troops in</p>
<p>toward the James River, and next day crossed it on the pontoon-bridge</p>
<p>and camped on the Blackwater, near Mt. Sinai Church.  Here he</p>
<p>remained till the 22d of June--the same day I reached the White House</p>
<p>with Gregg and Torbert--when, under orders from General Meade, he set</p>
<p>out to cut the enemy&#x27;s communications to the south and southwest of</p>
<p>Petersburg.</p>
<p>His instructions implied that the breaking up of the Petersburg and</p>
<p>Lynchburg, and Richmond and Danville railroads at Burkeville was the</p>
<p>most important part of his mission, and that when the work of</p>
<p>destruction began, it should be continued till he was driven off by</p>
<p>the enemy.  Wilson&#x27;s force consisted of about 5,500 men, General A.</p>
<p>V. Kautz, with the cavalry of the Army of the James, having joined</p>
<p>him for the expedition.  In moving out Wilson crossed the Weldon road</p>
<p>near Ream&#x27;s Station, first destroying it effectually at that point.</p>
<p>About fourteen miles west of Petersburg he struck the Southside</p>
<p>railroad, and broke it up clear to Burkeville, a distance of thirty</p>
<p>miles.  Having destroyed everything at Burkeville Junction, he moved</p>
<p>along the Danville road to Staunton River, completely wrecking about</p>
<p>thirty miles of that line also.  At Staunton River he found the</p>
<p>railroad bridge strongly guarded, and seeing that he could not burn</p>
<p>it, he began his return march that night, and reached Nottoway River,</p>
<p>some thirty miles south of Petersburg, at noon of the next day--the</p>
<p>28th.</p>
<p>In this expedition Wilson was closely followcd from the start by</p>
<p>Barringer&#x27;s brigade of W. H. F. Lee&#x27;s cavalry, but the operations</p>
<p>were not interfered with materially, his success being signal till he</p>
<p>reached the vicinity of Stony Creek depot on his return.  At this</p>
<p>point General Hampton, with his own and Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry, got</p>
<p>between Wilson and the Army of the Potomac, there being behind them</p>
<p>at Ream&#x27;s Station, at the same time, two brigades of infantry under</p>
<p>General Mahone.  A severe battle ensued, resulting in Wilson&#x27;s</p>
<p>defeat, with the loss of twelve guns and all his wagons.  In</p>
<p>consequence of this discomfiture he was obliged to fall back across</p>
<p>the Nottoway River with his own division, and rejoined the army by</p>
<p>way of Peter&#x27;s bridge on that stream, while Kautz&#x27;s division, unable</p>
<p>to unite with Wilson after the two commands had become separated in</p>
<p>the fight, made a circuit of the enemy&#x27;s left, and reached the lines</p>
<p>of our army in the night of the 28th.</p>
<p>Neither the presence of Hampton&#x27;s cavalry at Stony Creek depot, nor</p>
<p>the possession of Ream&#x27;s Station by the Confederate infantry, seems</p>
<p>to have been anticipated by Wilson, for in the report of the</p>
<p>expedition he states:</p>
<p>&quot;Foreseeing the probability of having to return northward, I wrote to</p>
<p>General Meade the evening before starting that I anticipated no</p>
<p>serious difficulty in executing his orders; but unless General</p>
<p>Sheridan was required to keep Hampton&#x27;s cavalry engaged, and our</p>
<p>infantry to prevent Lee from making detachments, we should probably</p>
<p>experience great difficulty in rejoining the army.  In reply to this</p>
<p>note, General Humphreys, chief-of-staff, informed me it was intended</p>
<p>the Army of the Potomac should cover the Weldon road the next day,</p>
<p>the Southside road the day after, and that Hampton having followed</p>
<p>Sheridan toward Gordonsville, I need not fear any trouble from him.&quot;</p>
<p>I doubt that General Meade&#x27;s letter of instructions and Wilson&#x27;s note</p>
<p>of the same evening, warrant what General Wilson here says.  It is</p>
<p>true that the Weldon railroad near Ream&#x27;s Station was not covered by</p>
<p>our infantry, as General Humphreys informed him it would be, but</p>
<p>Wilson is in error when he intimates that he was assured that I would</p>
<p>look after Hampton.  I do not think General Meade&#x27;s instructions are</p>
<p>susceptible of this interpretation.  I received no orders requiring</p>
<p>me to detain Hampton.  On the contrary, when I arrived at the White</p>
<p>House my instructions required me to break up the depot there, and</p>
<p>then bring the train across the Peninsula as soon as practicable, nor</p>
<p>were these instructions ever modified.  I began the duty imposed on</p>
<p>me on the morning of the 23d, totally in the dark as to what was</p>
<p>expected of Wilson, though it seems, from some correspondence between</p>
<p>Generals Grant and Meade, which I never saw till after the war, that</p>
<p>Grant thought Wilson could rely on Hampton&#x27;s absence from his field</p>
<p>of operations throughout the expedition.</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,</p>
<p>&quot;June 21, 1864. 9:20 A. M.</p>
<p>&quot;BRIGADIER-GENERAL WILSON,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Third Division Cavalry Corps.</p>
<p>&quot;The major-general commanding directs that you move your command at</p>
<p>2 A. M. to-morrow, the 22d instant, in execution of the duty assigned</p>
<p>you of destroying certain railroads.  Despatches received from the</p>
<p>White House state that Hampton&#x27;s cavalry was before that place</p>
<p>yesterday evening, and that General Sheridan had also reached there,</p>
<p>hence it is desirable that you should march at the earliest moment.</p>
<p>In passing Petersburg you will endeavor to avoid the observation of</p>
<p>the enemy, and then move by the shortest routes to the intersection</p>
<p>of the Petersburg and Lynchburg, and the Richmond and Danville</p>
<p>railroads, and destroy both these roads to the greatest extent</p>
<p>possible, continuing their destruction until driven from it by such</p>
<p>attacks of the enemy as you can no longer resist.  The destruction of</p>
<p>those roads to such an extent that they cannot be used by the enemy</p>
<p>in connection with Richmond during the remainder of the campaign is</p>
<p>an important part of the plan of campaign.  The latest information</p>
<p>from Major-General Hunter represents him to be a few miles west of</p>
<p>Lynchburg.  He may endeavor to form a junction with this army; you</p>
<p>will communicate with him if practicable, and have delivered to him</p>
<p>verbally the contents of the following copy of a communication from</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Grant to the major-general commanding this army.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Brooks, who will accompany your expedition part of the</p>
<p>way, should be informed where General Hunter will probably be found.</p>
<p>&quot;The success of your expedition will depend upon the secrecy with</p>
<p>which it is commenced, and the celerity with which its movements are</p>
<p>conducted; your command will, therefore, have with it the lightest</p>
<p>supplies and smallest number of wheels consistent with the thorough</p>
<p>execution of the duty, the supplies of the section of country you</p>
<p>will operate in being taken into account.  Upon the completion of the</p>
<p>work assigned you, you will rejoin this army.</p>
<p>&quot;The chief quartermaster was directed yesterday to supply you with</p>
<p>the implements and material for the destruction of railroads obtained</p>
<p>for General Sheridan.</p>
<p>[Signed] &quot;A. A. HUMPHREYS,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY FORCES,</p>
<p>Mount Sinai Church, June 21, 1864--6 P.M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL HUMPHREYS,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chief-of-Staff.</p>
<p>&quot;The instructions of the major-general commanding, of this date, are</p>
<p>received.  I shall march in obedience thereto at 2 A. M. to-morrow.</p>
<p>Before starting I would like to know if our infantry forces cover the</p>
<p>Weldon road.</p>
<p>&quot;I propose striking the Southside road first at Sutherland Station,</p>
<p>or some point in that vicinity, tearing up the track sufficiently to</p>
<p>delay railroad communication ten or twelve hours.  At this place I</p>
<p>shall detach a force to strike the Richmond and Danville road, by a</p>
<p>rapid march, at the nearest point, tearing up the track at every</p>
<p>practicable point between there and Burkeville.</p>
<p>&quot;From Sutherlands I shall move the main body of my command by the</p>
<p>Great road (breaking the railroad at every convenient point) directly</p>
<p>to Burkeville, which, if we succeed in capturing, will afford us the</p>
<p>opportunity of prosecuting our work with great advantage.  As soon as</p>
<p>I have made dispositions for communicating with Hunter and done all</p>
<p>the damage possible, I shall move with all possible rapidity for</p>
<p>Danville and Grenboro&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;Circumstances must, however, is a great degree control our movements</p>
<p>after leaving Burkeville.</p>
<p>&quot;If Sheridan will look after Hampton, I apprehend no difficulty, and</p>
<p>hope to be able to do the enemy great damage.  The ammunition issued</p>
<p>to my command is very defective.  The implements for destroying roads</p>
<p>have not yet arrived, but I learn from General Ingalls that they will</p>
<p>certainly be here early to-morrow.</p>
<p>[Signed] J. H. WILSON,</p>
<p>&quot;Brigadier-General Commanding.</p>
<p>The moment I received orders from General Meade to go to the relief</p>
<p>of Wilson, I hastened with Torbert and Gregg by way of Prince George</p>
<p>Court House and Lee&#x27;s Mills to Ream&#x27;s Station.  Here I found the</p>
<p>Sixth Corps, which Meade had pushed out on his left flank immediately</p>
<p>on hearing of Wilson&#x27;s mishap, but I was too late to render any</p>
<p>material assistance, Wilson having already disappeared, followed by</p>
<p>the enemy.  However, I at once sent out parties to gather</p>
<p>information, and soon learned that Wilson had got safe across the</p>
<p>Nottoway at Peter&#x27;s bridge and was making for the army by way of</p>
<p>Blunt&#x27;s bridge, on the Blackwater.</p>
<p>The benefits derived from this expedition, in the destruction of the</p>
<p>Southside and Danville railroads, were considered by General Grant as</p>
<p>equivalent for the losses sustained in Wilson&#x27;s defeat, for the</p>
<p>wrecking of the railroads and cars was most complete, occasioning at</p>
<p>this, time serious embarrassment to the Confederate Government; but I</p>
<p>doubt if all this compensated for the artillery and prisoners that</p>
<p>fell into the hands of the enemy in the swamps of Hatcher&#x27;s Run and</p>
<p>Rowanty Creek.  Wilson&#x27;s retreat from the perilous situation at</p>
<p>Ream&#x27;s station was a most creditable performance--in the face of two</p>
<p>brigades of infantry and three divisions of cavalry--and in the</p>
<p>conduct of the whole expedition the only criticism that can hold</p>
<p>against him is that he placed too much reliance on meeting our</p>
<p>infantry at Ream&#x27;s station, seeing that uncontrollable circumstances</p>
<p>might, and did, prevent its being there.  He ought to have marched on</p>
<p>the 28th by Jarrett&#x27;s Station to Peter&#x27;s bridge, on the Nottoway, and</p>
<p>Blunts bridge on the Blackwater, to the rear of the Army of the</p>
<p>Potomac.</p>
<p>When the safety of Wilson&#x27;s command was assured, I was ordered back</p>
<p>to Light House Point, where I had gone into camp after crossing the</p>
<p>James River to rest and recruit my command, now very much reduced in</p>
<p>numbers by reason of casualties to both horses and men.  It had been</p>
<p>marching and fighting for fifty consecutive days, and the fatiguing</p>
<p>service had told so fearfully on my animals that the number of</p>
<p>dismounted men in the corps was very large.  With the exception of</p>
<p>about four hundred horses that I received at the White House, no</p>
<p>animals were furnished to supply the deficiencies which had arisen</p>
<p>from the wearing marches of the past two months until I got to this</p>
<p>camp at Light House Point; here my needs were so obvious that they</p>
<p>could no longer be neglected.</p>
<p>I remained at Light House Point from the 2d to the 26th of July,</p>
<p>recuperating the cavalry, the intensely warm weather necessitating</p>
<p>almost an entire suspension of hostilities on the part of the Army of</p>
<p>the Potomac.  Meanwhile fifteen hundred horses were sent me here, and</p>
<p>these, with the four hundred already mentioned, were all that my</p>
<p>troops received while I held the personal command of the Cavalry</p>
<p>Corps, from April 6 to August 1, 1864.  This was not near enough to</p>
<p>mount the whole command, so I disposed the men who could not be</p>
<p>supplied in a dismounted camp.</p>
<p>By the 26th of July our strength was pretty well restored, and as</p>
<p>General Grant was now contemplating offensive operations for the</p>
<p>purpose of keeping Lee&#x27;s army occupied around Richmond, and also of</p>
<p>carrying Petersburg by assault if possible, I was directed to move to</p>
<p>the north side of the James River in conjunction with General</p>
<p>Hancock&#x27;s corps, and, if opportunity offered, to make a second</p>
<p>expedition against the Virginia Central railroad, and again destroy</p>
<p>the bridges on the North Anna, the Little and the South Anna rivers.</p>
<p>I started out on the afternoon of the 26th and crossed the Appomattox</p>
<p>at Broadway landing.  At Deep Bottom I was joined by Kautz&#x27;s small</p>
<p>division from the Army of the James, and here massed the whole</p>
<p>command, to allow Hancock&#x27;s corps to take the lead, it crossing to</p>
<p>the north bank of the James River by the bridge below the mouth of</p>
<p>Bailey&#x27;s Creek.  I moved late in the afternoon, so as not to come</p>
<p>within the enemy&#x27;s view before dark, and after night-fall Hancock&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps passed me and began crossing the pontoon-bridge about 2 o&#x27;clock</p>
<p>in the morning.</p>
<p>By daylight Hancock was across, the cavalry following.  Soon a</p>
<p>portion of his corps attacked the enemy&#x27;s works on the east side of</p>
<p>Bailey&#x27;s Creek, and, aided by the cavalry moving on its right,</p>
<p>captured four pieces of artillery.  This opened the way for Hancock</p>
<p>to push out his whole corps, and as he advanced by a wheel, with his</p>
<p>left as a pivot, the cavalry joined in the movement, pressing forward</p>
<p>on the New Market and Central or Charles City roads.</p>
<p>We did not go far before we found the enemy&#x27;s infantry posted across</p>
<p>these two roads behind a strong line of intrenchments on the west</p>
<p>bank of Bailey&#x27;s Creek.  His videttes in front of Ruffin&#x27;s house on</p>
<p>the New Market road were soon driven in on their main line, and the</p>
<p>high ground before the house was immediately occupied by Torbert and</p>
<p>Gregg, supported by Kautz&#x27;s division.  By the time the cavalry line</p>
<p>was formed the Confederate General Kershaw, with his own division of</p>
<p>infantry and those of Wilcox and Heath, advanced to attack us.</p>
<p>Directing the most of his troops against the cavalry, which was still</p>
<p>mounted, Kershaw drove it back some distance over the high ground.</p>
<p>When it reached the eastern face of the ridge, however, it was</p>
<p>quickly dismounted, and the men directed to lie down in line of</p>
<p>battle about fifteen yards from the crest, and here the onset of the</p>
<p>enemy was awaited.  When Kershaw&#x27;s men reached the crest such a</p>
<p>severe fire was opened on them, and at such close quarters, that they</p>
<p>could not withstand it, and gave way in disorder.  They were followed</p>
<p>across the plain by the cavalry, and lost about two hundred and fifty</p>
<p>prisoners and two battle-flags.  The counter attack against the</p>
<p>infantry by Torbert and Gregg re-established our line and gave us the</p>
<p>victory of Darbytown, but it also demonstrated the fact that General</p>
<p>Lee had anticipated the movement around his left flank by</p>
<p>transferring to the north side of the James a large portion of his</p>
<p>infantry and W. H. F. Lee&#x27;s division of cavalry.</p>
<p>This development rendered useless any further effort on Hancock&#x27;s</p>
<p>part or mine to carry out the plan of the expedition, for General</p>
<p>Grant did not intend Hancock to assault the enemy&#x27;s works unless</p>
<p>there should be found in them but a very thin line of infantry which</p>
<p>could be surprised.  In such event, Hancock was to operate so that</p>
<p>the cavalry might turn the Confederates on the Central or Charles</p>
<p>City road, but the continually increasing force of the enemy showed</p>
<p>this to be impracticable.  The long front presented by Hancock&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps and the cavalry deceived General Lee, and he undoubtedly</p>
<p>thought that nearly all of Grant&#x27;s army had been moved to the north</p>
<p>side of the James River; and to meet the danger he transferred the</p>
<p>most of his own strength to the same side to confront his adversary,</p>
<p>thinning the lines around Petersburg to reinforce those opposing us</p>
<p>on the Central and New Market roads.  This was what Grant hoped Lee</p>
<p>would do in case the operations of Hancock and myself became</p>
<p>impracticable, for Grant had an alternative plan for carrying</p>
<p>Petersburg by assault in conjunction with the explosion of a mine</p>
<p>that had been driven under the enemy&#x27;s works from the front of</p>
<p>Burnside&#x27;s corps.</p>
<p>Now that there was no longer a chance for the cavalry to turn the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s left, our attention was directed to keeping up the deception</p>
<p>of Lee, and on the afternoon of the 28th Hancock&#x27;s corps withdrew to</p>
<p>a line nearer the head of the bridge, the cavalry drawing back to a</p>
<p>position on his right.  From now on, all sorts of devices and</p>
<p>stratagems were practiced--anything that would tend to make the</p>
<p>Confederates believe we were being reinforced, while Hancock was</p>
<p>preparing for a rapid return to Petersburg at the proper time.  In</p>
<p>order to delude the enemy still more after night-fall of the 28th I</p>
<p>sent one of my divisions to the south side of the James, first</p>
<p>covering the bridgeway with refuse hay to keep the tram of the horses</p>
<p>from being heard.  After daylight the next morning, I marched this</p>
<p>division back again on foot, in full view of the enemy, to create the</p>
<p>impression of a continuous movement large bodies of infantry to the</p>
<p>north side, while the same time Kautz was made to skirmish with the</p>
<p>enemy on our extreme right.  These various artifices had the effect</p>
<p>intended, for by the evening of the 29th Lee had transferred all his</p>
<p>infantry to the north bank of the James, except three divisions, and</p>
<p>all his cavalry save one.</p>
<p>The morning of the 30th had been fixed upon to explode the mine and</p>
<p>assault the enemy&#x27;s works, so after dark on the evening of the 29th</p>
<p>Hancock hastily but quietly withdrew his corps to the south side to</p>
<p>take part in the engagement which was to succeed the explosion, and I</p>
<p>was directed to follow Hancock.  This left me on the north side of</p>
<p>the river confronting two-thirds of Lee&#x27;s army in a perilous</p>
<p>position, where I could easily be driven into Curl&#x27;s Neck and my</p>
<p>whole command annihilated.  The situation, therefore, was not a</p>
<p>pleasant one to contemplate, but it could not be avoided.  Luckily</p>
<p>the enemy did not see fit to attack, and my anxiety was greatly</p>
<p>relieved by getting the whole command safely across the bridge</p>
<p>shortly after daylight, having drawn in the different brigades</p>
<p>successively from my right.  By 10 o&#x27;clock on the morning of the 3oth</p>
<p>my leading division was well over toward the left of our army in</p>
<p>front of Petersburg, marching with the purpose to get around the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s right flank during the operations that were to succeed the</p>
<p>mine explosion, but when I reached General Meade&#x27;s headquarters I</p>
<p>found that lamentable failure had attended the assault made when the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s works were blown up in the morning.  Blunder after blunder</p>
<p>had rendered the assault abortive, and all the opportunities opened</p>
<p>by our expedition to the north side were irretrievably lost, so</p>
<p>General Meade at once arrested the movement of the cavalry.</p>
<p>In the expedition to Deep Bottom I was under the command of Major-</p>
<p>General Hancock, who, by seniority, was to control my corps as well</p>
<p>as his own until the way was opened for me to get out on the Virginia</p>
<p>Central railroad.  If this opportunity was gained, I was to cut loose</p>
<p>and damage Lee&#x27;s communications with the Shenandoah Valley in such</p>
<p>manner as best suited the conditions, but my return was not to be</p>
<p>jeopardized nor long delayed.  This necessitated that Hancock&#x27;s line</p>
<p>should extend to Bottom&#x27;s bridge on the Chickahominy.  The enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>early discovery of the movement and his concentration of troops on</p>
<p>the north side prevented Hancock from accomplishing the programme</p>
<p>laid out for him.  Its impracticability was demonstrated early on the</p>
<p>27th, and Hancock&#x27;s soldierly instincts told him this the moment he</p>
<p>unexpectedly discovered Kershaw blocking the New Market and Charles</p>
<p>City roads.  To Hancock the temptation to assault Kershaw&#x27;s position</p>
<p>was strong indeed, but if he carried it there would still remain the</p>
<p>dubious problem of holding the line necessary for my safe return, so</p>
<p>with rare judgment he desisted zealously turning to the alternative</p>
<p>proposition--the assault on Petersburg--for more significant results.</p>
<p>This was the only occasion during the war in which I was associated</p>
<p>with Hancock in campaign.  Up till then we had seldom met, and that</p>
<p>was the first opportunity I had to observe his quick apprehension,</p>
<p>his physical courage, and the soldierly personality which had long</p>
<p>before established his high reputation.</p>
<p>On the 1st of August, two days after the mine explosion, I was.</p>
<p>relieved from the personal command of the Cavalry Corps, and ordered</p>
<p>to the Shenandoah Valley, where at a later date Torbert&#x27;s and</p>
<p>Wilson&#x27;s divisions joined me.  Practically, after I went to the</p>
<p>valley, my command of the Cavalry Corps became supervisory merely.</p>
<p>During the period of my immediate control of the corps, I tried to</p>
<p>carry into effect, as far as possible, the views I had advanced</p>
<p>before and during the opening of the Wilderness campaign, i.e., &quot;that</p>
<p>our cavalry ought to fight the enemy&#x27;s cavalry, and our infantry the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s infantry&quot;; for there was great danger of breaking the spirit</p>
<p>of the corps if it was to be pitted against the enemy&#x27;s compact</p>
<p>masses of foot-troops posted behind intrenchments, and unless there</p>
<p>was some adequate tactical or strategical advantage to be gained,</p>
<p>such a use of it would not be justified.  Immediately succeeding the</p>
<p>battles of the Wilderness, opportunity offered to put this plan into</p>
<p>execution to some extent, and from that time forward--from the battle</p>
<p>of Yellow Tavern--our success was almost continuous, resulting</p>
<p>finally, before the close of the war, in the nearly total</p>
<p>annihilation of the enemy&#x27;s cavalry.</p>
<p>The constant activity of the corps from May 5 till August 1 gave</p>
<p>little opportunity for the various division and brigade commanders to</p>
<p>record its work in detail; so there exists but meagre accounts of the</p>
<p>numerous skirmishes and graver conflicts in which, in addition to the</p>
<p>fights mentioned in this narrative, it engaged.  A detailed history</p>
<p>of its performances is not within the province of a work of this</p>
<p>nature; but in review, it can be said, without trespassing on the</p>
<p>reader&#x27;s time, that the Cavalry Corps led the advance of the Army of</p>
<p>the Potomac into the Wilderness in the memorable campaign of 1864;</p>
<p>that on the expedition by way of Richmond to Haxall&#x27;s it marked out</p>
<p>the army&#x27;s line of march to the North Anna; that it again led the</p>
<p>advance to the Tolopotomy, and also to Cold Harbor, holding that</p>
<p>important strategic point at great hazard; and that by the Trevillian</p>
<p>expedition it drew away the enemy&#x27;s cavalry from the south side of</p>
<p>the Chickahominy, and thereby assisted General Grant materially in</p>
<p>successfully marching to the James River and Petersburg.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Wilson made his march to Staunton bridge, destroying</p>
<p>railroads and supplies of inestimable value, and though this was</p>
<p>neutralized by his disaster near Ream&#x27;s Station, the temporary set-</p>
<p>back there to one division was soon redeemed by victory over the</p>
<p>Confederate infantry at the battle of Darbytown.</p>
<p>In the campaign we were almost always on the march, night and day,</p>
<p>often unable to care properly for our wounded, and obliged to bury</p>
<p>our dead where they fell; and innumerable combats attest the part the</p>
<p>cavalry played in Grant&#x27;s march from the Rapidan to Petersburg.  In</p>
<p>nearly all of these our casualties were heavy, particularly so when,</p>
<p>as was often the case, we had to engage the Confederate infantry; but</p>
<p>the enemy returned such a full equivalent in dead and wounded in</p>
<p>every instance, that finally his mounted power, which from the</p>
<p>beginning of the war had been nurtured with a wise appreciation of</p>
<p>its value, was utterly broken.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>
<p>GENERAL HUNTER&#x27;S SUCCESSFUL MARCH AND SUBSEQUENT RETREAT--GENERAL</p>
<p>JUBAL A. EARLY THREATENS WASHINGTON--CHAMBERSBURG, PA., BURNED--</p>
<p>SELECTED TO OPERATE AGAINST GENERAL EARLY--THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY--</p>
<p>THE CONFEDERATE ARMY.</p>
<p>When the attempt to take Petersburg in conjunction with the mine</p>
<p>explosion resulted in such a dismal failure, all the operations</p>
<p>contemplated in connection with that project came to a standstill,</p>
<p>and there was every prospect that the intensely hot and sultry</p>
<p>weather would prevent further activity in the Army of the Potomac</p>
<p>till a more propitious season.  Just now, however, the conditions</p>
<p>existing in the Shenandoah Valley and along the upper Potomac</p>
<p>demanded the special attention of General Grant, for, notwithstanding</p>
<p>the successful march that Major-General David Hunter had made toward</p>
<p>Lynchburg early in the summer, what he had first gained was</p>
<p>subsequently lost by strategical mistakes, that culminated in</p>
<p>disaster during the retreat he was obliged to make from the vicinity</p>
<p>of Lynchburg to the Kanawha Valley.  This route of march uncovered</p>
<p>the lower portion of the Valley of the Shenandoah, and with the</p>
<p>exception of a small force of Union troops under General Franz Sigel</p>
<p>posted aft Martinsburg for the purpose of covering the Baltimore and</p>
<p>Ohio railroad, there was nothing at hand to defend the lower valley.</p>
<p>The different bodies of Confederates which compelled Hunter&#x27;s retreat</p>
<p>were under command of General Jubal A. Early, who had been sent to</p>
<p>Lynchburg with Ewell&#x27;s corps after the defeat of the Confederate</p>
<p>General W. C. Jones near Staunton on the 5th of June, to take command</p>
<p>of the Valley District.  When Early had forced Hunter into the</p>
<p>Kanawha region far enough to feel assured that Lynchburg could not</p>
<p>again be threatened from that direction, he united to his own corps</p>
<p>General John C. Breckenridge&#x27;s infantry division and the cavalry of</p>
<p>Generals J. H. Vaughn, John McCausland.  B. T. Johnson, and J. D.</p>
<p>Imboden, which heretofore had been operating in southwest and western</p>
<p>Virginia under General Robert Ransom, Jr., and with the column thus</p>
<p>formed, was ready to turn his attention to the lower Shenandoah</p>
<p>Valley.  At Early&#x27;s suggestion General Lee authorized him to move</p>
<p>north at an opportune moment, cross the upper Potomac into Maryland</p>
<p>and threaten Washington.  Indeed, General Lee had foreshadowed such a</p>
<p>course when Early started toward Lynchburg for the purpose of</p>
<p>relieving the pressure in front of Petersburg, but was in some doubt</p>
<p>as to the practicability of the movement later, till persuaded to it</p>
<p>by the representations of Early after that general had driven Hunter</p>
<p>beyond the mountains and found little or nothing opposing except the</p>
<p>small force of Sigel, which he thought he could readily overcome by</p>
<p>celerity of movement.</p>
<p>By rapid marching Early reached Winchester on the 2d of July, and on</p>
<p>the 4th occupied Martinsburg, driving General Sigel out of that place</p>
<p>the same day that Hunter&#x27;s troops, after their fatiguing retreat</p>
<p>through the mountains, reached Charlestown, West Virginia.  Early was</p>
<p>thus enabled to cross the Potomac without difficulty, when, moving</p>
<p>around .  Harper&#x27;s Ferry, through the gaps of the South Mountain, he</p>
<p>found his path unobstructed till he reached the Monocacy, where</p>
<p>Ricketts&#x27;s division of the Sixth Corps, and some raw troops that had</p>
<p>been collected by General Lew Wallace, met and held the Confederates</p>
<p>till the other reinforcements that had been ordered to the capital</p>
<p>from Petersburg could be brought up.  Wallace contested the line of</p>
<p>the Monocacy with obstinacy, but had to retire finally toward</p>
<p>Baltimore.  The road was then open to Washington, and Early marched</p>
<p>to the outskirts and began against the capital the demonstrations</p>
<p>which were designed to divert the Army of the Potomac from its main</p>
<p>purpose in front of Petersburg.</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s audacity in thus threatening Washington had caused some</p>
<p>concern to the officials in the city, but as the movement was looked</p>
<p>upon by General Grant as a mere foray which could have no decisive</p>
<p>issue, the Administration was not much disturbed till the</p>
<p>Confederates came in close proximity.  Then was repeated the alarm</p>
<p>and consternation of two years before, fears for the safety of the</p>
<p>capital being magnified by the confusion and discord existing among</p>
<p>the different generals in Washington and Baltimore; and the imaginary</p>
<p>dangers vanished only with the appearance of General Wright, who,</p>
<p>with the Sixth Corps and one division of the Nineteenth Corps, pushed</p>
<p>out to attack Early as soon as he could get his arriving troops in</p>
<p>hand, but under circumstances that precluded celerity of movement;</p>
<p>and as a consequence the Confederates escaped with little injury,</p>
<p>retiring across the Potomac to Leesburg, unharassed save by some</p>
<p>Union cavalry that had been sent out into Loudoun County by Hunter,</p>
<p>who in the meantime had arrived at Harper&#x27;s Ferry by the Baltimore</p>
<p>and Ohio railroad.  From Leesburg Early retired through Winchester</p>
<p>toward Strasburg, but when the head of his column reached this place</p>
<p>he found that he was being followed by General Crook with the</p>
<p>combined troops of Hunter and Sigel only, Wright having returned to</p>
<p>Washington under orders to rejoin Meade at Petersburg.  This</p>
<p>reduction of the pursuing force tempting Early to resume the</p>
<p>offensive, he attacked Crook at Kernstown, and succeeded in</p>
<p>administering such a check as to necessitate this general&#x27;s retreat</p>
<p>to Martinsburg, and finally to Harper&#x27;s Ferry.  Crook&#x27;s withdrawal</p>
<p>restored to Early the line of the upper Potomac, so, recrossing this</p>
<p>stream, he advanced again into Maryland, and sending McCausland on to</p>
<p>Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, laid that town in ashes, leaving three</p>
<p>thousand non-combatants without shelter or food.</p>
<p>When Early fell back from the vicinity of Washington toward</p>
<p>Strasburg, General Grant believed that he would rejoin Lee, but later</p>
<p>manoeuvres of the enemy indicated that Early had given up this idea,</p>
<p>if he ever, entertained it, and intended to remain in the valley,</p>
<p>since it would furnish Lee and himself with subsistence, and also</p>
<p>afford renewed opportunities for threatening Washington.  Indeed, the</p>
<p>possession of the Valley of the Shenandoah at this time was of vast</p>
<p>importance to Lee&#x27;s army, and on every hand there were indications</p>
<p>that the Confederate Government wished to hold it at least until</p>
<p>after the crops could be gathered in to their depots at Lynchburg and</p>
<p>Richmond.  Its retention, besides being of great advantage in the</p>
<p>matter of supplies, would also be a menace to the North difficult for</p>
<p>General Grant to explain, and thereby add an element of considerable</p>
<p>benefit to the Confederate cause; so when Early&#x27;s troops again</p>
<p>appeared at Martinsburg it was necessary for General Grant to</p>
<p>confront them with a force strong enough to put an end to incursions</p>
<p>north of the Potomac, which hitherto had always led to National</p>
<p>discomfiture at some critical juncture, by turning our army in</p>
<p>eastern Virginia from its chief purpose--the destruction of Lee and</p>
<p>the capture of the Confederate capital.</p>
<p>This second irruption of Early, and his ruthless destruction of</p>
<p>Chambersburg led to many recommendations on the part of General Grant</p>
<p>looking to a speedy elimination of the confusion then existing among</p>
<p>the Union forces along the upper Potomac, but for a time the</p>
<p>authorities at Washington would approve none of his propositions.</p>
<p>The President and Secretary Stanton seemed unwilling to adopt his</p>
<p>suggestions, and one measure which he deemed very important--the</p>
<p>consolidation into a single command of the four geographical</p>
<p>districts into which, to relieve political pressure no doubt, the</p>
<p>territory had been divided--met with serious opposition.  Despite</p>
<p>Grant&#x27;s representations, he could not prevail on the Administration</p>
<p>to approve this measure, but finally the manoeuvres of Early and the</p>
<p>raid to Chambersburg compelled a partial compliance, though Grant had</p>
<p>somewhat circumvented the difficulty already by deciding to appoint a</p>
<p>commander for the forces in the field that were to operate against</p>
<p>Early.</p>
<p>On the 31st of July General Grant selected me as this commander, and</p>
<p>in obedience to his telegraphic summons I repaired to his</p>
<p>headquarters at City Point.  In the interview that followed, he</p>
<p>detailed to me the situation of affairs on the upper Potomac, telling</p>
<p>me that I was to command in the field the troops that were to operate</p>
<p>against Early, but that General Hunter, who was at the head of the</p>
<p>geographical department, would be continued in his position for the</p>
<p>reason that the Administration was reluctant to reconstruct or</p>
<p>consolidate the different districts.  After informing me that one</p>
<p>division of the Cavalry Corps would be sent to my new command, he</p>
<p>went on to say that he wanted me to push the enemy as soon as this</p>
<p>division arrived, and if Early retired up the Shenandoah Valley I was</p>
<p>to pursue, but if he crossed the Potomac I was to put myself south of</p>
<p>him and try to compass his destruction.  The interview having ended,</p>
<p>I returned to Hancock Station to prepare for my departure, and on the</p>
<p>evening of August 1 I was relieved from immediate duty with the Army</p>
<p>of the Potomac, but not from command of the cavalry as a corps</p>
<p>organization.</p>
<p>I arrived at Washington on the 4th of August, and the next day</p>
<p>received instructions from General Halleck to report to General Grant</p>
<p>at Monocacy Junction, whither he had gone direct from City Point, in</p>
<p>consequence of a characteristic despatch from the President</p>
<p>indicating his disgust with the confusion, disorder, and helplessness</p>
<p>prevailing along the upper Potomac, and intimating that Grant&#x27;s</p>
<p>presence there was necessary.</p>
<p>In company with the Secretary of War I called on the President before</p>
<p>leaving Washington, and during a short conversation Mr. Lincoln</p>
<p>candidly told me that Mr. Stanton had objected to my assignment to</p>
<p>General Hunter&#x27;s command, because he thought me too young, and that</p>
<p>he himself had concurred with the Secretary; but now, since General</p>
<p>Grant had &quot;ploughed round&quot; the difficulties of the situation by</p>
<p>picking me out to command the &quot;boys in the field,&quot; he felt satisfied</p>
<p>with what had been done, and &quot;hoped for the best.&quot;  Mr. Stanton</p>
<p>remained silent during these remarks, never once indicating whether</p>
<p>he, too, had become reconciled to my selection or not; and although,</p>
<p>after we left the White House, he conversed with me freely in regard</p>
<p>to the campaign I was expected to make, seeking to impress on me the</p>
<p>necessity for success from the political as well as from the military</p>
<p>point of view, yet he utterly ignored the fact that he had taken any</p>
<p>part in disapproving the recommendation of the general-in-chief.</p>
<p>August 6, I reported to General Grant at the Monocacy, and he there</p>
<p>turned over to me the following instructions, which he had previously</p>
<p>prepared for General Hunter in the expectation that general would</p>
<p>continue to command the department:</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIELD,</p>
<p>&quot;Monocacy Bridge, Md., Aug.  5, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL: Concentrate all your available force without delay in the</p>
<p>vicinity of Harper&#x27;s Ferry, leaving only such railroad guards and</p>
<p>garrisons for public property as may be necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;Use in this concentration the railroad, if by so doing time can be</p>
<p>saved.  From Harper&#x27;s Ferry, if it is found that the enemy has moved</p>
<p>north of the Potomac in large force, push north, following and</p>
<p>attacking him wherever found; following him, if driven south of the</p>
<p>Potomac, as long as it is safe to do so.  If it is ascertained that</p>
<p>the enemy has but a small force north of the Potomac, then push south</p>
<p>the main force, detaching, under a competent commander, a sufficient</p>
<p>force to look after the raiders and drive them to their homes.  In</p>
<p>detaching such a force, the brigade of cavalry now en route from</p>
<p>Washington via Rockville may be taken into account.</p>
<p>&quot;There are now on the way to join you three other brigades of the</p>
<p>best of cavalry, numbering at least five thousand men and horses.</p>
<p>These will be instructed, in the absence of further orders, to join</p>
<p>you by the south side of the Potomac.  One brigade will probably</p>
<p>start to-morrow.</p>
<p>&quot;In pushing up the Shenandoah Valley, as it is expected you will have</p>
<p>to go first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left to</p>
<p>invite the enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and stock</p>
<p>wanted for the use of your command.  Such as cannot be consumed,</p>
<p>destroy.  It is not desirable that the buildings should be destroyed-</p>
<p>-they should, rather, be protected; but the people should be informed</p>
<p>that so long as an army can subsist among them recurrences of these</p>
<p>raids must be expected, and we are determined to stop them at all</p>
<p>hazards.</p>
<p>&quot;Bear in mind, the object is to drive the enemy south; and to do this</p>
<p>you want to keep him always in sight.  Be guided in your course by</p>
<p>the course he takes.</p>
<p>&quot;Make your own arrangements for supplies of all kinds, giving regular</p>
<p>vouchers for such as may be taken from loyal citizens in the country</p>
<p>through which you march.</p>
<p>&quot;Very respectfully,</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General D. HUNTER,</p>
<p>&quot;Commanding Department of West Virginia.&quot;</p>
<p>When I had read the letter addressed to Hunter, General Grant said I</p>
<p>would be expected to report directly to him, as Hunter had asked that</p>
<p>day to be wholly relieved, not from any chagrin at my assignment to</p>
<p>the control of the active forces of his command, but because he</p>
<p>thought that his fitness for the position he was filling was</p>
<p>distrusted by General Halleck, and he had no wish to cause</p>
<p>embarrassment by remaining where he could but remove me one degree</p>
<p>from the headquarters of the army.  The next day Hunter&#x27;s unselfish</p>
<p>request was complied with, and an order was issued by the President,</p>
<p>consolidating the Middle Department, the Department of Washington,</p>
<p>the Department of the Susquehanna, and the Department of West</p>
<p>Virginia.</p>
<p>Under this order these four geographical districts constituted the</p>
<p>Middle Military Division, and I was temporarily assigned to command</p>
<p>it.  Hunter&#x27;s men had been bivouacking for some days past in the</p>
<p>vicinity of Monocacy Junction and Frederick, but before General</p>
<p>Grant&#x27;s instructions were written out, Hunter had conformed to them</p>
<p>by directing the concentration at Halltown, about four miles in front</p>
<p>of Harper&#x27;s Ferry, of all his force available for field service.</p>
<p>Therefore the different bodies of troops, with the exception of</p>
<p>Averell&#x27;s cavalry, which had followed McCausland toward Moorefield</p>
<p>after the burning of Chambersburg, were all in motion toward Halltown</p>
<p>on August 6.</p>
<p>Affairs at Monocacy kept me but an hour or two, and these disposed</p>
<p>of, I continued on to Harper&#x27;s Ferry by the special train which had</p>
<p>brought me from Washington, that point being intended as my</p>
<p>headquarters while making preparations to advance.  The enemy was</p>
<p>occupying Martinsburg, Williamsport, and Shepherdstown at the time;</p>
<p>sending occasional raiding parties into Maryland as far as</p>
<p>Hagerstown.  The concentration of my troops at Halltown being an</p>
<p>indication to Early that we intended to renew the offensive, however,</p>
<p>he immediately began counter preparations by drawing in all his</p>
<p>detached columns from the north side of the Potomac, abandoning a</p>
<p>contemplated raid into Maryland, which his success against Crook at</p>
<p>Kernstown had prompted him to project, and otherwise disposing</p>
<p>himself for defense.</p>
<p>At Harper&#x27;s Ferry I made my headquarters in the second story of a</p>
<p>small and very dilapidated hotel, and as soon as settled sent for</p>
<p>Lieutenant John R. Meigs, the chief engineer officer of the command,</p>
<p>to study with him the maps of my geographical division.  It always</p>
<p>came rather easy to me to learn the geography of a new section, and</p>
<p>its important topographical features as well; therefore I found that,</p>
<p>with the aid of Meigs, who was most intelligent in his profession,</p>
<p>the region in which I was to operate would soon be well fixed in my</p>
<p>mind.  Meigs was familiar with every important road and stream, and</p>
<p>with all points worthy of note west of the Blue Ridge, and was</p>
<p>particularly well equipped with knowledge regarding the Shenandoah</p>
<p>Valley, even down to the farmhouses.  He imparted with great</p>
<p>readiness what he knew of this, clearly pointing out its</p>
<p>configuration and indicating the strongest points for Confederate</p>
<p>defense, at the same time illustrating scientifically and forcibly</p>
<p>the peculiar disadvantages under which the Union army had hitherto</p>
<p>labored.</p>
<p>The section that received my closest attention has its northern limit</p>
<p>along the Potomac between McCoy&#x27;s ferry at the eastern base of the</p>
<p>North Mountain, and Harper&#x27;s Ferry at the western base of the Blue</p>
<p>Ridge.  The southern limit is south of Staunton, on the divide which</p>
<p>separates the waters flowing into the Potomac from those that run to</p>
<p>the James.  The western boundary is the eastern slope of the</p>
<p>Alleghany Mountains, the eastern, the Blue Ridge; these two distinct</p>
<p>mountain ranges trending about southwest inclose a stretch of quite</p>
<p>open, undulating country varying in width from the northern to the</p>
<p>southern extremity, and dotted at frequent intervals with patches of</p>
<p>heavy woods: At Martinsburg the valley is about sixty miles broad,</p>
<p>and on an east and west line drawn through Winchester about forty-</p>
<p>five, while at Strasburg it narrows down to about twenty-five.  Just</p>
<p>southeast of Strasburg, which is nearly midway between the eastern</p>
<p>and western walls of the valley, rises an abrupt range of mountains</p>
<p>called Massanutten, consisting of several ridges which extend</p>
<p>southward between the North and South Forks of the Shenandoah River</p>
<p>until, losing their identity, they merge into lower but broken ground</p>
<p>between New Market and Harrisonburg.  The Massanutten ranges, with</p>
<p>their spurs and hills, divide the Shenandoah Valley into two valleys,</p>
<p>the one next the Blue Ridge being called the Luray, while that next</p>
<p>the North Mountain retains the name of Shenandoah.</p>
<p>A broad macadamized road, leading south from Williamsport, Maryland,</p>
<p>to Lexington, Virginia, was built at an early day to connect the</p>
<p>interior of the latter State with the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, and</p>
<p>along this road are situated the principal towns and villages of the</p>
<p>Shenandoah Valley, with lateral lines of communication extending to</p>
<p>the mountain ranges on the east and west.  The roads running toward</p>
<p>the Blue Ridge are nearly all macadamized, and the principal ones</p>
<p>lead to the railroad system of eastern Virginia through Snicker&#x27;s,</p>
<p>Ashby&#x27;s Manassas, Chester, Thornton&#x27;s Swift Run, Brown&#x27;s and Rock-</p>
<p>fish gaps, tending to an ultimate centre at Richmond.  These gaps are</p>
<p>low and easy, offering little obstruction to the march of an army</p>
<p>coming from eastern Virginia, and thus the Union troops operating</p>
<p>west of the Blue Ridge were always subjected to the perils of a flank</p>
<p>attack; for the Confederates could readily be brought by rail to</p>
<p>Gordonsville and Charlottesville, from which points they could move</p>
<p>with such celerity through the Blue Ridge that, on more than one</p>
<p>occasion, the Shenandoah Valley had been the theatre of Confederate</p>
<p>success, due greatly to the advantage of possessing these interior</p>
<p>lines.</p>
<p>Nature had been very kind to the valley, making it rich and</p>
<p>productive to an exceptional degree, and though for three years</p>
<p>contending armies had been marching up and down it, the fertile soil</p>
<p>still yielded ample subsistence for Early&#x27;s men, with a large surplus</p>
<p>for the army of Lee.  The ground had long been well cleared of</p>
<p>timber, and the rolling surface presented so few obstacles to the</p>
<p>movement of armies that they could march over the country in any</p>
<p>direction almost as well as on the roads, the creeks and rivers being</p>
<p>everywhere fordable, with little or no difficulty beyond that of</p>
<p>leveling the approaches.</p>
<p>I had opposing me an army largely composed of troops that had</p>
<p>operated in this region hitherto under &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson with</p>
<p>marked success, inflicting defeat on the Union forces almost every</p>
<p>time the two armies had come in contact. These men were now commanded</p>
<p>by a veteran officer of the Confederacy-General Jubal A. Early--whose</p>
<p>past services had so signalized his ability that General Lee</p>
<p>specially selected him to take charge of the Valley District, and,</p>
<p>notwithstanding the misfortunes that befell him later, clung to him</p>
<p>till the end, of the war.  The Confederate army at this date was</p>
<p>about twenty thousand strong, and consisted of Early&#x27;s own corps,</p>
<p>with Generals Rodes, Ramseur, and Gordon commanding its divisions;</p>
<p>the infantry of Breckenridge from southwestern Virginia; three</p>
<p>battalions of artillery; and the cavalry brigades of Vaughn, Johnson,</p>
<p>McCausland, and Imboden.  This cavalry was a short time afterward</p>
<p>organized into a division under the command of General Lomax.</p>
<p>After discovering that my troops were massing in front of Harper&#x27;s</p>
<p>Ferry, Early lost not a moment in concentrating his in the vicinity</p>
<p>of Martinsburg, in positions from which he could continue to obstruct</p>
<p>the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and yet be enabled to retire up the</p>
<p>valley under conditions of safety when I should begin an offensive</p>
<p>campaign.</p>
<p>When I took command of the Army of the Shenandoah its infantry force</p>
<p>comprised the Sixth Corps, one division of the Nineteenth Corps, and</p>
<p>two divisions from West Virginia.  The Sixth Corps was commanded by</p>
<p>Major-General Horatio G. Wright; its three divisions by Brigadier-</p>
<p>Generals David A. Russell, Geo.  W. Getty, and James B. Ricketts.</p>
<p>The single division of the Nineteenth Corps had for its immediate</p>
<p>chief Brigadier-General William Dwight, the corps being commanded by</p>
<p>Brigadier-General Wm.  H. Emory.  The troops from West Virginia were</p>
<p>under Brigadier-General George Crook, with Colonels Joseph Thoburn</p>
<p>and Isaac H. Duval as division commanders, and though in all not more</p>
<p>than one fair-sized division, they had been designated, on account of</p>
<p>the department they belonged to, the Army of West Virginia.  General</p>
<p>Torbert&#x27;s division, then arriving from the Cavalry Corps of the Army</p>
<p>of the Potomac, represented the mounted arm of the service, and in</p>
<p>the expectation that Averell would soon join me with his troopers, I</p>
<p>assigned General Torbert as chief of cavalry, and General Wesley</p>
<p>Merritt succeeded to the command of Torbert&#x27;s division.</p>
<p>General Wright, the commander of the Sixth Corps, was an officer of</p>
<p>high standing in the Corps of Engineers, and had seen much active</p>
<p>service during the preceding three years.  He commanded the</p>
<p>Department of the Ohio throughout the very trying period of the</p>
<p>summer and fall of 1862, and while in that position he, with other</p>
<p>prominent officers, recommended my appointment as a brigadier-</p>
<p>general.  In 1863 he rendered valuable service at the battle of</p>
<p>Gettysburg, following which he was assigned to the Sixth Corps, and</p>
<p>commanded it at the capture of the Confederate works at Rappahannock</p>
<p>Station and in the operations at Mine Run.  He ranked me as a major-</p>
<p>general of volunteers by nearly a year in date of commission, but my</p>
<p>assignment by the President to the command of the army in the valley</p>
<p>met with Wright&#x27;s approbation, and, so far as I have ever known, he</p>
<p>never questioned the propriety of the President&#x27;s action.  The Sixth</p>
<p>Corps division commanders, Getty, Russell, and Ricketts, were all</p>
<p>educated soldiers, whose records, beginning with the Mexican War, had</p>
<p>already been illustrated in the war of the rebellion by distinguished</p>
<p>service in the Army of the Potomac.</p>
<p>General Emory was a veteran, having graduated at the Military Academy</p>
<p>in 1831, the year I was born.  In early life he had seen much service</p>
<p>in the Artillery, the Topographical Engineers, and the Cavalry, and</p>
<p>in the war of the rebellion had exhibited the most soldierly</p>
<p>characteristics at Port Hudson and on the Red River campaign.  At</p>
<p>this time he had but one division of the Nineteenth Corps present,</p>
<p>which division was well commanded by General Dwight, a volunteer</p>
<p>officer who had risen to the grade of brigadier-general through</p>
<p>constant hard work.  Crook was a classmate of mine--at least, we</p>
<p>entered the Military Academy the same year, though he graduated a</p>
<p>year ahead of me.  We had known each other as boys before we entered</p>
<p>the army, and later as men, and I placed implicit faith in his</p>
<p>experience and qualifications as a general.</p>
<p>The transfer of Torbert to the position of chief of cavalry left</p>
<p>Merritt, as I have already said, in command of the First Cavalry</p>
<p>Division.  He had been tried in the place before, and from the day he</p>
<p>was selected as one of a number of young men to be appointed general</p>
<p>officers, with the object of giving life to the Cavalry Corps, he</p>
<p>filled the measure of expectation.  Custer was one of these young men</p>
<p>too, and though as yet commanding a brigade under Merritt, his</p>
<p>gallant fight at Trevillian Station, as well as a dozen others during</p>
<p>the summer, indicated that he would be equal to the work that was to</p>
<p>fall to him when in a few weeks he should succeed Wilson.  But to go</p>
<p>on down the scale of rank, describing the officers who commanded in</p>
<p>the Army of the Shenandoah, would carry me beyond all limit, so I</p>
<p>refrain from the digression with regret that I cannot pay to each his</p>
<p>well-earned tribute.</p>
<p>The force that I could take with me into the field at this time</p>
<p>numbered about 26,000 men.  Within the limits of the geographical</p>
<p>division there was a much greater number of troops than this.</p>
<p>Baltimore, Washington, Harper&#x27;s Ferry, Hagerstown, Frederick,</p>
<p>Cumberland, and a score of other points; besides the strong</p>
<p>detachments that it took to keep the Baltimore and Ohio railroad open</p>
<p>through the mountains of West Virginia, and escorts for my trains,</p>
<p>absorbed so many men that the column which could be made available</p>
<p>for field operations was small when compared with the showing on</p>
<p>paper.  Indeed, it was much less than it ought to have been, but for</p>
<p>me, in the face of the opposition made by different interests</p>
<p>involved, to detach troops from any of the points to which they had</p>
<p>been distributed before I took charge was next to impossible.</p>
<p>In a few days after my arrival preparations were completed, and I was</p>
<p>ready to make the first move for the possession of the Shenandoah</p>
<p>Valley.  For the next five weeks the operations on my part consisted</p>
<p>almost wholly of offensive and defensive manoeuvring for certain</p>
<p>advantages, the enemy confining himself meanwhile to measures</p>
<p>intended to counteract my designs.  Upon the advent of Torbert, Early</p>
<p>immediately grew suspicious, and fell back twelve miles south of</p>
<p>Martinsburg, to Bunker Hill and vicinity, where his right flank would</p>
<p>be less exposed, but from which position he could continue to</p>
<p>maintain the break in the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and push</p>
<p>reconnoitring parties through Smithfield to Charlestown.  These</p>
<p>reconnoitring parties exhibited considerable boldness at times, but</p>
<p>since they had no purpose in view save to discover whether or not we</p>
<p>were moving, I did not contest any ground with them except about our</p>
<p>outposts.  Indeed, I desired that Early might remain at some point</p>
<p>well to the north till I was fully prepared to throw my army on his</p>
<p>right and rear and force a battle, and hence I abstained from</p>
<p>disturbing him by premature activity, for I thought that if I could</p>
<p>beat him at Winchester, or north of it, there would be far greater</p>
<p>chances of weighty results.  I therefore determined to bring my</p>
<p>troops, if it were at all possible to do so, into such a position</p>
<p>near that town as to oblige Early to fight.  The sequel proved,</p>
<p>however, that he was accurately informed of all my movements.  To</p>
<p>anticipate them, therefore, he began his retreat up the valley the</p>
<p>day that I moved out from Halltown, and (consequently was able to</p>
<p>place himself south of Winchester before I could get there.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXIV.</p>
<p>MOVING ON GENERAL EARLY--GENERAL GRANT&#x27;S LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS--</p>
<p>DESTROYING THE RESOURCES OF THE VALLEY--REASON FOR THE DESTRUCTION--</p>
<p>WITHDRAWAL TO HALLTOWN--ALARM IN THE NORTH OVER THE RETROGRADE</p>
<p>MOVEMENT--RENEWING THE ADVANCE UP THE VALLEY--GENERAL ANDERSON&#x27;S</p>
<p>ATTEMPT TO RETURN TO PETERSBURG--STRENGTH OF THE ARMIES.</p>
<p>For a clear understanding of the operations which preceded the</p>
<p>victories that resulted in almost annihilating General Early&#x27;s army</p>
<p>in the Shenandoah Valley, it is necessary to describe in considerable</p>
<p>detail the events that took place prior to the 19th of September.  My</p>
<p>army marched from Harper&#x27;s Ferry on the l0th of August, 1864, General</p>
<p>Torbert with Merritt&#x27;s division of cavalry moving in advance through</p>
<p>Berryville, going into position near White Post.  The Sixth Corps,</p>
<p>under General Wright, moved by way of Charlestown and Summit Point to</p>
<p>Clifton; General Emory, with Dwight&#x27;s division of the Nineteenth</p>
<p>Corps, marched along the Berryville pike through Berryville to the</p>
<p>left of the position of the Sixth Corps at Clifton; General Crook&#x27;s</p>
<p>command, moving on the Kabletown road, passed through Kabletown to</p>
<p>the vicinity of Berryville, and went into position on the left of</p>
<p>Dwight&#x27;s division, while Colonel Lowell, with a detached force of two</p>
<p>small regiments of cavalry, marched to Summit Point; so that on the</p>
<p>night of August 10 my infantry occupied a line stretching from</p>
<p>Clifton to Berryville, with Merritt&#x27;s cavalry at White Post and</p>
<p>Lowell&#x27;s at Summit Point.  The enemy, as stated before, moved at the</p>
<p>same time from Bunker Hill and vicinity, and stretched his line from</p>
<p>where the Winchester and Potomac railroad crosses Opequon Creek to</p>
<p>the point at which the Berryville and Winchester pike crosses the</p>
<p>same stream, thus occupying the west bank to cover Winchester.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th the Sixth Corps was ordered to move across</p>
<p>the country toward the junction of the Berryville-Winchester pike and</p>
<p>the Opequon, and to take the crossing and hold it, Dwight&#x27;s division</p>
<p>being directed to move through Berryville on the White Post road for</p>
<p>a mile, then file to the right by heads of regiments at deploying</p>
<p>distances, and carry the crossing of Opequon Creek at a ford about</p>
<p>three-fourths of a mile from the left of the Sixth Corps, while Crook</p>
<p>was instructed to move out on the White Post road, a mile and a half</p>
<p>beyond Berryville, then head to the right and secure the ford about a</p>
<p>mile to the left of Dwight; Torbert&#x27;s orders were to push Merritt&#x27;s</p>
<p>division up the Millwood pike toward Winchester, attack any force he</p>
<p>might run against, and ascertain the movements of the Confederate</p>
<p>army; and lastly, Lowell received instructions to close in from</p>
<p>Summit Point on the right of the Sixth Corps.</p>
<p>My object in securing the fords was to further my march on Winchester</p>
<p>from the southeast, since, from all the information gathered during</p>
<p>the l0th, I still thought Early could be brought to a stand at that</p>
<p>point; but in this I was mistaken, as Torbert&#x27;s reconnoissance</p>
<p>proved, for on the morning of the 11th, when Merritt had driven the</p>
<p>Confederate cavalry, then covering the Millwood pike west of the</p>
<p>Opequon, off toward Kernstown, he found that their infantry and</p>
<p>artillery were retreating south, up the Valley pike.</p>
<p>As soon as this information was obtained Torbert moved quickly</p>
<p>through the toll-gate on the Front Royal and Winchester road to</p>
<p>Newtown, to strike the enemy&#x27;s flank and harass him in his retreat,</p>
<p>Lowell following up through Winchester, on the Valley pike; Crook was</p>
<p>turned to the left and ordered to Stony Point, while Emory and</p>
<p>Wright, marching to the left also, were directed to take post on the</p>
<p>night of the 11th between the Millwood and Front Royal roads, within</p>
<p>supporting distance of Crook.  Merritt meeting some of the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry at the tollgate, drove it in the direction of Newtown till it</p>
<p>got inside the line of Gordon&#x27;s division of infantry, which had been</p>
<p>thrown out and posted behind barricades to cover the flank of the</p>
<p>main force in its retreat.  A portion of Merritt&#x27;s cavalry attacked</p>
<p>this infantry and drove in its skirmish-line, and though not able to</p>
<p>dislodge Gordon, Merritt held the ground gained till night-fall, when</p>
<p>the Confederate infantry moved off under cover of darkness to Hupp&#x27;s</p>
<p>Hill, between Strasburg and Cedar Creek</p>
<p>The next morning Crook marched from Stony Point to Cedar Creek, Emory</p>
<p>followed with Dwight, and the cavalry moved to the same point by way</p>
<p>of Newtown and the Valley pike, the Sixth Corps following the</p>
<p>cavalry.  That night Crook was in position at Cedar Creek, on the</p>
<p>left of the Valley pike, Emory on the right of the pike, the Sixth</p>
<p>Corps on the right of Emory, and the cavalry on the flanks.  In the</p>
<p>afternoon a heavy skirmish-line had been thrown forward to the</p>
<p>heights on the south side of Cedar Creek, and a brisk affair with the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s pickets took place, the Confederates occupying with their</p>
<p>main force the heights north of Strasburg.  On the morning of the</p>
<p>13th my cavalry went out to reconnoitre toward Strasburg, on the</p>
<p>middle road, about two and a half miles west of the Valley pike, and</p>
<p>discovered that Early&#x27;s infantry was at Fisher&#x27;s Hill, where he had</p>
<p>thrown up behind Tumbling Run earthworks extending clear across the</p>
<p>narrow valley between the Massanutten and North mountains.  On the</p>
<p>left of these works he had Vaughan&#x27;s, McCausland&#x27;s, and Johnson&#x27;s</p>
<p>brigades of cavalry under General Lomax, who at this time relieved</p>
<p>General Ramseur from the command of the Confederate mounted forces.</p>
<p>Within the past day or two I had received information that a column</p>
<p>of the enemy was moving up from Culpeper Court House and approaching</p>
<p>Front Royal through Chester Gap, and although the intelligence was</p>
<p>unconfirmed, it caused me much solicitude; for there was strong</p>
<p>probability that such a movement would be made, and any considerable</p>
<p>force advancing through Front Royal toward Winchester could fall upon</p>
<p>my rear and destroy my communication with Harper&#x27;s Ferry, or, moving</p>
<p>along the base of Massanutten Mountain, could attack my flank in</p>
<p>conjunction with the force at Fisher&#x27;s Hill without a possibility of</p>
<p>my preventing it.</p>
<p>Neither Wilson&#x27;s cavalry nor Grower&#x27;s infantry had yet joined me, and</p>
<p>the necessities, already explained, which obliged me to hold with</p>
<p>string garrisons Winchester and other points heretofore mentioned.</p>
<p>had so depleted my line of battle strength that I knew the enemy</p>
<p>would outnumber me when Anderson&#x27;s corps should arrive in the valley.</p>
<p>I deemed it advisable, therefore, to act with extreme caution, so,</p>
<p>with the exception of a cavalry reconnoissance on the 13th, I</p>
<p>remained on the defensive, quietly awaiting developments.  In the</p>
<p>evening of that day the enemy&#x27;s skirmishers withdrew to Tumbling Run,</p>
<p>his main force remaining inactive behind the intrenchments at</p>
<p>Fisher&#x27;s Hill waiting for the arrival of Anderson.</p>
<p>The rumors in regard to the force advancing from Culpeper kept</p>
<p>increasing every hour, so on the morning of the 14th I concluded to</p>
<p>send a brigade of cavalry to Front Royal to ascertain definitely what</p>
<p>was up.  At the same time I crossed the Sixth Corps to the south side</p>
<p>of Cedar Creek, and occupied the heights near Strasburg.  That day I</p>
<p>received from the hands of Colonel Chipman, of the Adjutant-General&#x27;s</p>
<p>Department, the following despatch, to deliver which he had ridden in</p>
<p>great haste from Washington through Snicker&#x27;s Gap, escorted by a</p>
<p>regiment of cavalry:</p>
<p>&quot;CITY POINT, August 12, 1864--9 A. M.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK</p>
<p>&quot;Inform General Sheridan that it is now certain two (2) divisions of</p>
<p>infantry have gone to Early, and some cavalry and twenty (20) pieces</p>
<p>of artillery.  This movement commenced last Saturday night.  He must</p>
<p>be cautious, and act now on the defensive until movements here force</p>
<p>them to detach to send this way.  Early&#x27;s force, with this increase,</p>
<p>cannot exceed forty thousand men, but this is too much for General</p>
<p>Sheridan to attack.  Send General Sheridan the remaining brigade of</p>
<p>the Nineteenth Corps.</p>
<p>&quot;I have ordered to Washington all the one-hundred-day men.  Their</p>
<p>time will soon be out, but for the present they will do to serve in</p>
<p>the defenses.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>The despatch explained the movement from Culpeper, and on the morning</p>
<p>of the 15th Merritt&#x27;s two remaining brigades were sent to Front Royal</p>
<p>to oppose Anderson, and the Sixth Corps withdrawn to the north side</p>
<p>of Cedar Creek, where it would be in a position enabling me either to</p>
<p>confront Anderson or to act defensively, as desired by General Grant.</p>
<p>To meet the requirements of his instructions I examined the map of</p>
<p>the valley for a defensive line--a position where a smaller number of</p>
<p>troops could hold a larger number--for this information led me to</p>
<p>suppose that Early&#x27;s force would greatly exceed mine when Anderson&#x27;s</p>
<p>two divisions of infantry and Fitzhugh Lee&#x27;s cavalry had joined him.</p>
<p>I could see but one such position, and that was at Halltown, in front</p>
<p>of Harper&#x27;s Ferry.  Subsequent experience convinced me that there was</p>
<p>no other really defensive line in the Shenandoah Valley, for at</p>
<p>almost any other point the open country and its peculiar topography</p>
<p>invites rather than forbids flanking operations.</p>
<p>This retrograde movement would also enable me to strengthen my</p>
<p>command by Grower&#x27;s division of the Nineteenth Corps and Wilson&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry, both of which divisions were marching from Washington by way</p>
<p>of Snicker&#x27;s Gap.</p>
<p>After fully considering the matter, I determined to move back to</p>
<p>Halltown, carrying out, as I retired, my instructions to destroy all</p>
<p>the forage and subsistence the country afforded.  So Emory was</p>
<p>ordered to retire to Winchester on the night of the 15th, and Wright</p>
<p>and Crook to follow through Winchester to Clifton the next night.</p>
<p>For the cavalry, in this move to the rear, I gave the following</p>
<p>instructions:</p>
<p>&quot;....In pushing up the Shenandoah Valley, as it is expected you will</p>
<p>have to go first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left</p>
<p>to invite the enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and</p>
<p>stock wanted for the use of your command.  Such as cannot be</p>
<p>consumed, destroy.  It is not desirable that buildings should be</p>
<p>destroyed--they should, rather, be protected; but the people should</p>
<p>be informed that so long as an army can subsist among them,</p>
<p>recurrences of these raids must be expected, and we are determined to</p>
<p>stop them at all hazards....&quot; [Grant&#x27;s letter of instructions.]</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,</p>
<p>&quot;Cedar Creek, Va., August 16, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;GENERAL: In compliance with instructions of the Lieutenant-General</p>
<p>commanding, you will make the necessary arrangements and give the</p>
<p>necessary orders for the destruction of the wheat and hay south of a</p>
<p>line from Millwood to Winchester and Petticoat Gap.  You will seize</p>
<p>all mules, horses, and cattle that may be useful to our army.  Loyal</p>
<p>citizens can bring in their claims against the Government for this</p>
<p>necessary destruction.  No houses will be burned, and officers in</p>
<p>charge of this delicate but necessary duty must inform the people</p>
<p>that the object is to make this valley untenable for the raiding</p>
<p>parties of the rebel army.</p>
<p>&quot;Very respectfully,</p>
<p>&quot;P. H. SHERIDAN,</p>
<p>&quot;Major-General Commanding.</p>
<p>&quot;BRIGADIER-GENERAL A. T. A. TORBERT,</p>
<p>&quot;Chief of Cavalry, Middle Military Division.&quot;</p>
<p>During his visit to General Hunter at the Monocacy, General Grant had</p>
<p>not only decided to retain in the Shenandoah Valley a large force</p>
<p>sufficient to defeat Early&#x27;s army or drive it back to Lee, but he had</p>
<p>furthermore determined to make that sections by the destruction of</p>
<p>its supplies, untenable for continued occupancy by the Confederates.</p>
<p>This would cut off one of Lee&#x27;s main-stays in the way of subsistence,</p>
<p>and at the same time diminish the number of recruits and conscripts</p>
<p>he received; the valley district while under his control not only</p>
<p>supplying Lee with an abundance of food, but also furnishing him many</p>
<p>men for his regular and irregular forces.  Grant&#x27;s instructions to</p>
<p>destroy the valley began with the letter of August 5 to Hunter, which</p>
<p>was turned over to me, and this was followed at intervals by more</p>
<p>specific directions, all showing the earnestness of his purpose.</p>
<p>&quot;CITY POINT, Va., Aug. 16--3:30 P. M., 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Winchester, Va.:</p>
<p>&quot;If you can possibly spare a division of cavalry, send them through</p>
<p>Loudoun County to destroy and carry off the crops, animals, negroes,</p>
<p>and all men under fifty years of age capable of bearing arms.  In</p>
<p>this way you will get many of Mosby&#x27;s men.  All male citizens under</p>
<p>fifty can fairly be held as prisoners of war, not as citizen</p>
<p>prisoners.  If not already soldiers, they will be made so the moment</p>
<p>the rebel army gets hold of them.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>&quot;CITY POINT, Aug. 21, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Charlestown, Va.:</p>
<p>&quot;In stripping Loudoun County of supplies, etc., impress from all</p>
<p>loyal persons so that they may receive pay for what is taken from</p>
<p>them.  I am informed by the Assistant Secretary of War that Loudoun</p>
<p>County has a large population of Quakers, who are all favorably</p>
<p>disposed to the Union.  These people may be exempted from arrest.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES</p>
<p>&quot;CITY POINT, Va., Aug. 26,2:30 P. M. 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Halltown, Va.:</p>
<p>&quot;Telegraphed you that I had good reason for believing that Fitz Lee</p>
<p>had been ordered back here.  I now think it likely that all troops</p>
<p>will be ordered back from the valley except what they believe to be</p>
<p>the minimum number to detain you.  My reason for supposing this is</p>
<p>based upon the fact that yielding up the Weldon road seems to be a</p>
<p>blow to the enemy he cannot stand.  I think I do not overstate the</p>
<p>loss of the enemy in the last two weeks at 10,000 killed and wounded.</p>
<p>We have lost heavily, mostly in captured when the enemy gained</p>
<p>temporary advantages.  Watch closely, and if you find this theory</p>
<p>correct, push with all vigor.  Give the enemy no rest, and if it is</p>
<p>possible to follow to the Virginia Central road, follow that far.  Do</p>
<p>all the damage to railroads and crops you can.  Carry off stock of</p>
<p>all descriptions and negroes, so as to prevent further planting.  If</p>
<p>the war is to last another year we want the Shenandoah Valley to</p>
<p>remain a barren waste.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.</p>
<p>&quot;HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,</p>
<p>&quot;CITY POINT, Va., Sept. 4,--10 A. M.--1864.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Charlestown, Va.:</p>
<p>&quot;In cleaning out the arms-bearing community of Loudoun County and the</p>
<p>subsistence for armies, exercise your own judgment as to who should</p>
<p>be exempt from arrest, and as to who should receive pay for their</p>
<p>stock, grain, etc.  It is our interest that that county should not be</p>
<p>capable of subsisting a hostile army, and at the same time we want to</p>
<p>inflict as little hardship upon Union men as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;CITY POINT, Va., Nov. 9, 1864.</p>
<p>&quot;MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Cedar Creek, Va.:</p>
<p>&quot;Do you not think it advisable to notify all citizens living east of</p>
<p>the Blue Ridge to move out north of the Potomac all their stock,</p>
<p>grain, and provisions of every description?  There is no doubt about</p>
<p>the necessity of clearing out that country so that it will not</p>
<p>support Mosby&#x27;s gang.  And the question is whether it is not better</p>
<p>that the people should save what they can.  So long as the war lasts</p>
<p>they must be prevented from raising another crop, both there and as</p>
<p>high up the valley as we can control.</p>
<p>&quot;U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.&quot;</p>
<p>He had rightly concluded that it was time to bring the war home to a</p>
<p>people engaged in raising crops from a prolific soil to feed the</p>
<p>country&#x27;s enemies, and devoting to the Confederacy its best youth.  I</p>
<p>endorsed the programme in all its parts, for the stores of meat and</p>
<p>grain that the valley provided, and the men it furnished for Lee&#x27;s</p>
<p>depleted regiments, were the strongest auxiliaries he possessed in</p>
<p>the whole insurgent section.  In war a territory like this is a</p>
<p>factor of great importance, and whichever adversary controls it</p>
<p>permanently reaps all the advantages of its prosperity.  Hence, as I</p>
<p>have said, I endorsed Grant&#x27;s programme, for I do not hold war to</p>
<p>mean simply that lines of men shall engage each other in battle, and</p>
<p>material interests be ignored.  This is but a duel, in which one</p>
<p>combatant seeks the other&#x27;s life; war means much more, and is far</p>
<p>worse than this.  Those who rest at home in peace and plenty see but</p>
<p>little of the horrors attending such a duel, and even grow</p>
<p>indifferent to them as the struggle goes on, contenting themselves</p>
<p>with encouraging all who are able-bodied to enlist in the cause, to</p>
<p>fill up the shattered ranks as death thins them.  It is another</p>
<p>matter, however, when deprivation and suffering are brought to their</p>
<p>own doors.  Then the case appears much graver, for the loss of</p>
<p>property weighs heavy with the most of mankind; heavier often, than</p>
<p>the sacrifices made on the field of battle.  Death is popularly</p>
<p>considered the maximum of punishment in war, but it is not; reduction</p>
<p>to poverty brings prayers for peace more surely and more quickly than</p>
<p>does the destruction of human life, as the selfishness of man has</p>
<p>demonstrated in more than one great conflict.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 16th I started back to Winchester, whence I</p>
<p>could better supervise our regressive march.  As I was passing</p>
<p>through Newtown, I heard cannonading from the direction of Front</p>
<p>Royal, and on reaching Winchester, Merritt&#x27;s couriers brought me word</p>
<p>that he had been attacked at the crossing of the Shenandoah by</p>
<p>Kershaw&#x27;s division of Anderson&#x27;s corps and two brigades of Fitzhugh</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s cavalry, but that the attack had been handsomely repulsed, with</p>
<p>a capture of two battle-flags and three hundred prisoners.  This was</p>
<p>an absolute confirmation of the despatch from Grant; and I was now</p>
<p>more than satisfied with the wisdom of my withdrawal.</p>
<p>At daylight of the 17th Emory moved from Winchester to Berryville,</p>
<p>and the same morning Crook and Wright reached Winchester, having</p>
<p>started from Cedar Creek the day before.  From Winchester, Crook and</p>
<p>Wright resumed their march toward Clifton, Wright, who had the rear</p>
<p>guard, getting that day as far as the Berryville crossing of the</p>
<p>Opequon, where he was ordered to remain, while Crook went ahead till</p>
<p>he reached the vicinity of Berryville.  On the afternoon of the 17th</p>
<p>Lowell with his two regiments of troopers came into Winchester, where</p>
<p>he was joined by Wilson&#x27;s mounted division, which had come by a rapid</p>
<p>march from Snicker&#x27;s ferry.  In the mean time Merritt, after his</p>
<p>handsome engagement with Kershaw near Front Royal, had been ordered</p>
<p>back to the neighborhood of White Post, so that my cavalry outposts</p>
<p>now extended from this last point around to the west of Winchester.</p>
<p>During all these operations the enemy had a signal-station on Three</p>
<p>Top Mountain, almost overhanging Strasburg, from which every movement</p>
<p>made by our troops could be plainly seen; therefore, early on the</p>
<p>morning of the 17th he became aware of the fact that we were retiring</p>
<p>down the valley, and at once made after us, and about sundown drove</p>
<p>Torbert out of Winchester, he having been left there-with Wilson and</p>
<p>Lowell, and the Jersey brigade of the Sixth Corps, to develop the</p>
<p>character of the enemy&#x27;s pursuit.  After a severe skirmish Wilson and</p>
<p>Lowell fell back to Summit Point, and the Jersey brigade joined its</p>
<p>corps at the crossing of the Opequon.  This affair demonstrated that</p>
<p>Early&#x27;s whole army had followed us from Fisher&#x27;s Hill, in concert</p>
<p>with Anderson and Fitzhugh Lee from Front Royal, and the two columns</p>
<p>joined near Winchester the morning of the 18th.</p>
<p>That day I moved the Sixth Corps by way of Clifton to Flowing Spring,</p>
<p>two and a half miles west of Charlestown, on the Smithfield pike; and</p>
<p>Emory, with Dwight&#x27;s and Grower&#x27;s divisions (Grower&#x27;s having joined</p>
<p>that morning from Washington), to a position about the same distance</p>
<p>south of Charlestown, on the Berryville pike.  Following these</p>
<p>movements, Merritt fell back to Berryville, covering the Berryville</p>
<p>pike crossing of the Opequon, and Wilson was stationed at Summit</p>
<p>Point, whence he held a line along the Opequon as far north as the</p>
<p>bridge at Smithfield.  Crook continued to hold on near Clifton until</p>
<p>the next day, and was then moved into place on the left of Emory.</p>
<p>This line was practically maintained till the 21st, when the enemy,</p>
<p>throwing a heavy force across the Opequon by the bridge at</p>
<p>Smithfield, drove in my cavalry pickets to Summit Point, and followed</p>
<p>up with a rapid advance against the position of the Sixth Corps near</p>
<p>Flowing Spring.  A sharp and obstinate skirmish with a heavy picket-</p>
<p>line of the Sixth Corps grew out of this manoeuvre, and resulted very</p>
<p>much in our favor, but the quick withdrawal of the Confederates left</p>
<p>no opportunity for a general engagement.  It seems that General Early</p>
<p>thought I had taken position near Summit Point, and that by moving</p>
<p>rapidly around through Smithfield he could fall upon my rear in</p>
<p>concert with an attack in front by Anderson, but the warm reception</p>
<p>given him disclosed his error, for he soon discovered that my line</p>
<p>lay in front of Charlestown instead of where he supposed.</p>
<p>In the manoeuvre Merritt had been attacked in front of Berryville and</p>
<p>Wilson at Summit Point, the former by cavalry and the latter by</p>
<p>Anderson&#x27;s infantry.  The exposed positions of Merritt and Wilson</p>
<p>necessitated their withdrawal if I was to continue to act on the</p>
<p>defensive; so, after the army had moved back to Halltown the</p>
<p>preceding night, without loss or inconvenience, I called them in and</p>
<p>posted them on the right of the infantry.</p>
<p>My retrograde move from Strasburg to Halltown caused considerable</p>
<p>alarm in the North, as the public was ignorant of the reasons for it;</p>
<p>and in the excited state of mind then prevailing, it was generally</p>
<p>expected that the reinforced Confederate army would again cross the</p>
<p>Potomac, ravage Maryland and Pennsylvania, and possibly capture</p>
<p>Washington.  Mutterings of dissatisfaction reached me from many</p>
<p>sources, and loud calls were made for my removal, but I felt</p>
<p>confident that my course would be justified when the true situation</p>
<p>was understood, for I knew that I was complying with my instructions.</p>
<p>Therefore I paid small heed to the adverse criticisms pouring down</p>
<p>from the North almost every day, being fully convinced that the best</p>
<p>course was to bide my time, and wait till I could get the enemy into</p>
<p>a position from which he could not escape without such serious</p>
<p>misfortune as to have some bearing on the general result of the war.</p>
<p>Indeed, at this time I was hoping that my adversary would renew the</p>
<p>boldness he had exhibited the early part of the month, and strike for</p>
<p>the north side of the Potomac, and wrote to General Grant on the 20th</p>
<p>of August that I had purposely left everything in that direction open</p>
<p>to the enemy.</p>
<p>On the 22d the Confederates moved to Charlestown and pushed well up</p>
<p>to my position at Halltown.  Here for the next three days they</p>
<p>skirmished with my videttes and infantry pickets, Emory and Cook</p>
<p>receiving the main attention; but finding that they could make no</p>
<p>impression, and judging it to be an auspicious time to intensify the</p>
<p>scare in the North, on the 25th of August Early despatched Fitzhugh</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s cavalry to Williamsport, and moved all the rest of his army but</p>
<p>Anderson&#x27;s infantry and McCausland&#x27;s cavalry to Kerneysville.  This</p>
<p>same day there was sharp picket firing along the whole front of my</p>
<p>infantry line, arising, as afterward ascertained, from a heavy</p>
<p>demonstration by Anderson.  During this firing I sent Torbert, with</p>
<p>Merritt&#x27;s and Wilson&#x27;s divisions, to Kerrteysville, whence he was to</p>
<p>proceed toward Leetown and learn what had become of Fitz. Lee.</p>
<p>About a mile from Leetown Torbert met a small force of Confederate</p>
<p>cavalry, and soon after encountering it, stumbled on Breckenridge&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps of infantry on the march, apparently heading for Shepherdstown.</p>
<p>The surprise was mutual, for Torbert expected to meet only the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s cavalry, while the Confederate infantry column was</p>
<p>anticipating an unobstructed march to the Potomac.  Torbert attacked</p>
<p>with such vigor as at first to double up the head of Breckenridge&#x27;s</p>
<p>corps and throw it into confusion, but when the Confederates realized</p>
<p>that they were confronted only by cavalry, Early brought up the whole</p>
<p>of the four infantry divisions engaged in his manoeuvre, and in a</p>
<p>sharp attack pushed Torbert rapidly back.</p>
<p>All the advantages which Torbert had gained by surprising the enemy</p>
<p>were nullified by this counter-attack, and he was obliged to withdraw</p>
<p>Wilson&#x27;s division toward my right, to the neighborhood of Duffield&#x27;s</p>
<p>Station, Merritt drawing back to the same point by way of the</p>
<p>Shepherdstown ford.  Custer&#x27;s brigade becoming isolated after the</p>
<p>fight while assisting the rear guard, was also obliged to retire,</p>
<p>which it did to Shepherdstown and there halted, picketing the river</p>
<p>to Antietam ford.</p>
<p>When Torbert reported to me the nature of his encounter, and that a</p>
<p>part of Early&#x27;s infantry was marching to the north, while Fitzhugh</p>
<p>Lee&#x27;s cavalry had gone toward Martinsburg, I thought that the</p>
<p>Confederate general meditated crossing his cavalry into Maryland, so</p>
<p>I sent Wilson by way of Harper&#x27;s Ferry to watch his movements from</p>
<p>Boonesboro&#x27;, and at the same time directed Averell, who had reported</p>
<p>from West Virginia some days before, to take post at Williamsport and</p>
<p>hold the crossing there until he was driven away.  I also thought it</p>
<p>possible that Early might cross the Potomac with his whole army, but</p>
<p>the doubts of a movement like this outweighed the probabilities</p>
<p>favoring it.  Nevertheless, to meet such a contingency I arranged to</p>
<p>throw my army on his rear should the occasion arise, and deeming my</p>
<p>position at Halltown the most advantageous in which to await</p>
<p>developments, my infantry was retained there.</p>
<p>If General Early had ever intended to cross the Potomac, Torbert&#x27;s</p>
<p>discovery of his manoeuvre put an end to his scheme of invasion, for</p>
<p>he well knew that and success he might derive from such a course</p>
<p>would depend on his moving with celerity, and keeping me in ignorance</p>
<p>of his march till it should be well under way; so he settled all the</p>
<p>present uncertainties by retiring with all his troops about</p>
<p>Kerneysville to his old position at Bunker Hill behind the Opequon,</p>
<p>and on the night of the 26th silently withdrew Anderson and</p>
<p>McCausland from my front at Halltown to Stephenson&#x27;s depot.</p>
<p>By the 27th all of Early&#x27;s infantry was in position at Brucetown and</p>
<p>Bunker Hill, his cavalry holding the outposts of Leetown and</p>
<p>Smithfield, and on that day Merritt&#x27;s division attacked the enemy&#x27;s</p>
<p>horse at Leetown, and pressed it back through Smithfield to the west</p>
<p>side of the Opequon.  This reconnoissance determined definitely that</p>
<p>Early had abandoned the projected movement into Maryland, if he ever</p>
<p>seriously contemplated it; and I marched my infantry out from</p>
<p>Halltown to the front of Charlestown, with the intention of occupying</p>
<p>a line between Clifton and Berryville the moment matters should so</p>
<p>shape themselves that I could do so with advantage.  The night of the</p>
<p>28th Wilson joined me near Charlestown from his points of observation</p>
<p>in Maryland, and the next day Averell crossed the Potomac at</p>
<p>Williamsport and advanced to Martinsburg.</p>
<p>Merritt&#x27;s possession of Smithfield bridge made Early somewhat uneasy,</p>
<p>since it afforded opportunity for interposing a column between his</p>
<p>right and left flanks, so he concluded to retake the crossing, and,</p>
<p>to this end, on the 29th advanced two divisions of infantry.  A</p>
<p>severe fight followed, and Merritt was forced to retire, being driven</p>
<p>through the village toward Charlestown with considerable loss.  As</p>
<p>Merritt was nearing my infantry line, I ordered.  Ricketts&#x27;s division</p>
<p>of the Sixth Corps to his relief, and this in a few minutes turned</p>
<p>the tide, the Smithfield crossing of the Opequon being regained, and</p>
<p>afterward held by Lowell&#x27;s brigade, supported by Ricketts.  The next</p>
<p>morning I moved Torbert, with Wilson and Merritt, to Berryville, and</p>
<p>succeeding their occupation of that point there occurred along my</p>
<p>whole line a lull, which lasted until the 3d of September, being</p>
<p>undisturbed except by a combat near Bunker Hill between Averell&#x27;s</p>
<p>cavalry and a part of McCausland&#x27;s, supported by Rodes&#x27;s division of</p>
<p>infantry, in which affair the Confederates were defeated with the</p>
<p>loss of about fifty prisoners and considerable property in the shape</p>
<p>of wagons and beef-cattle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Torbert&#x27;s movement to Berryville had alarmed Early, and as</p>
<p>a counter move on the 2d of September he marched with the bulk of his</p>
<p>army to Summit Point, but while reconnoitring in that region on the</p>
<p>3d he learned of the havoc that Averell was creating in his rear, and</p>
<p>this compelled him to recross to the west side of the Opequon and</p>
<p>mass his troops in the vicinity of Stephenson&#x27;s depot, whence he</p>
<p>could extend down to Bunker Hill, continue to threaten the Baltimore</p>
<p>and Ohio railroad, and at the same time cover Winchester.</p>
<p>The same day I was moving my infantry to take up the Clifton-</p>
<p>Berryville line, and that afternoon Wright went into position at</p>
<p>Clifton, Crook occupied Berryville, and Emory&#x27;s corps came in between</p>
<p>them, forming almost a continuous line.  Torbert had moved to White</p>
<p>Post meanwhile, with directions to reconnoitre as far south as the</p>
<p>Front Royal Pike.</p>
<p>My infantry had just got fairly into this position about an hour</p>
<p>before sunset, when along Crook&#x27;s front a combat took place that at</p>
<p>the time caused me to believe it was Early&#x27;s purpose to throw a</p>
<p>column between Crook and Torbert, with the intention of isolating the</p>
<p>latter; but the fight really arose from the attempt of General</p>
<p>Anderson to return to Petersburg with Kershaw&#x27;s division in response</p>
<p>to loud calls from General Lee.  Anderson started south on the 3d of</p>
<p>September, and possibly this explains Early&#x27;s reconnoissance that day</p>
<p>to Summit Point as a covering movement, but his rapid withdrawal left</p>
<p>him in ignorance of my advance, and Anderson marched on heedlessly</p>
<p>toward Berryville, expecting to cross the Blue Ridge through Ashby&#x27;s</p>
<p>Gap.  At Berryville however, he blundered into Crook&#x27;s lines about</p>
<p>sunset, and a bitter little fight ensued, in which the Confederates</p>
<p>got so much the worst of it that they withdrew toward Winchester.</p>
<p>When General Early received word of this encounter he hurried to</p>
<p>Anderson&#x27;s assistance with three divisions, but soon perceiving what</p>
<p>was hitherto unknown to him, that my whole army was on a new line, he</p>
<p>decided, after some slight skirmishing, that Anderson must remain at</p>
<p>Winchester until a favorable opportunity offered for him to rejoin</p>
<p>Lee by another route.</p>
<p>Succeeding the discomfiture of Anderson, some minor operations took</p>
<p>place on the part of, Averell on the right and McIntosh&#x27;s brigade of</p>
<p>Wilson&#x27;s division on the left, but from that time until the 19th of</p>
<p>September no engagement of much importance occurred.  The line from</p>
<p>Clifton to Berryville was occupied by the Sixth Corps and Grower&#x27;s</p>
<p>and Dwight&#x27;s divisions of the Nineteenth, Crook being transferred to</p>
<p>Summit Point, whence I could use him to protect my right flank and my</p>
<p>communication with Harper&#x27;s Ferry, while the cavalry threatened the</p>
<p>enemy&#x27;s right flank and line of retreat up the valley.</p>
<p>The difference of strength between the two armies at this date was</p>
<p>considerably in my favor, but the conditions attending my situation</p>
<p>in a hostile region necessitated so much detached service to protect</p>
<p>trains, and to secure Maryland and Pennsylvania from raids, that my</p>
<p>excess in numbers was almost canceled by these incidental demands</p>
<p>that could not be avoided, and although I knew that I was strong,</p>
<p>yet, in consequence of the injunctions of General Grant, I deemed it</p>
<p>necessary to be very cautious; and the fact that the Presidential</p>
<p>election was impending made me doubly so, the authorities at</p>
<p>Washington having impressed upon me that the defeat of my army might</p>
<p>be followed by the overthrow of the party in power, which event, it</p>
<p>was believed, would at least retard the progress of the war, if,</p>
<p>indeed, it did not lead to the complete abandonment of all coercive</p>
<p>measures.  Under circumstances such as these I could not afford to</p>
<p>risk a disaster, to say nothing of the intense disinclination every</p>
<p>soldier has for such results; so, notwithstanding my superior</p>
<p>strength, I determined to take all the time necessary to equip myself</p>
<p>with the fullest information, and then seize an opportunity under</p>
<p>such conditions that I could not well fail of success.</p>
