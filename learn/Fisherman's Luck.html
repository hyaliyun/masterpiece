<p>M. DE MONTAIGNE: Divers Events.</p>
<p>DEDICATION TO MY LADY GRAYGOWN</p>
<p>Here is the basket; I bring it home to you.  There are no great fish</p>
<p>in it.  But perhaps there may be one or two little ones which will</p>
<p>be to your taste.  And there are a few shining pebbles from the bed</p>
<p>of the brook, and ferns from the cool, green woods, and wild flowers</p>
<p>from the places that you remember.  I would fain console you, if I</p>
<p>could, for the hardship of having married an angler: a man who</p>
<p>relapses into his mania with the return of every spring, and never</p>
<p>sees a little river without wishing to fish in it.  But after all,</p>
<p>we have had good times together as we have followed the stream of</p>
<p>life towards the sea.  And we have passed through the dark days</p>
<p>without losing heart, because we were comrades.  So let this book</p>
<p>tell you one thing that is certain.  In all the life of your</p>
<p>fisherman the best piece of luck is just YOU.</p>

<p>FISHERMAN&#x27;S LUCK</p>
<p>Has it ever fallen in your way to notice the quality of the</p>
<p>greetings that belong to certain occupations?</p>
<p>There is something about these salutations in kind which is</p>
<p>singularly taking and grateful to the ear.  They are as much better</p>
<p>than an ordinary &quot;good day&quot; or a flat &quot;how are you?&quot; as a folk-song</p>
<p>of Scotland or the Tyrol is better than the futile love-ditty of the</p>
<p>drawing-room.  They have a spicy and rememberable flavour.  They</p>
<p>speak to the imagination and point the way to treasure-trove.</p>
<p>There is a touch of dignity in them, too, for all they are so free</p>
<p>and easy--the dignity of independence, the native spirit of one who</p>
<p>takes for granted that his mode of living has a right to make its</p>
<p>own forms of speech.  I admire a man who does not hesitate to salute</p>
<p>the world in the dialect of his calling.</p>
<p>How salty and stimulating, for example, is the sailorman&#x27;s hail of</p>
<p>&quot;Ship ahoy!&quot;  It is like a breeze laden with briny odours and a</p>
<p>pleasant dash of spray.  The miners in some parts of Germany have a</p>
<p>good greeting for their dusky trade.  They cry to one who is going</p>
<p>down the shaft, &quot;Gluck auf!&quot;  All the perils of an underground</p>
<p>adventure and all the joys of seeing the sun again are compressed</p>
<p>into a word.  Even the trivial salutation which the telephone has</p>
<p>lately created and claimed for its peculiar use--&quot;Hello, hello&quot;--</p>
<p>seems to me to have a kind of fitness and fascination.  It is like a</p>
<p>thoroughbred bulldog, ugly enough to be attractive.  There is a</p>
<p>lively, concentrated, electric air about it.  It makes courtesy wait</p>
<p>upon dispatch, and reminds us that we live in an age when it is</p>
<p>necessary to be wide awake.</p>
<p>I have often wished that every human employment might evolve its own</p>
<p>appropriate greeting.  Some of them would be queer, no doubt; but at</p>
<p>least they would be an improvement on the wearisome iteration of</p>
<p>&quot;Good-evening&quot; and &quot;Good-morning,&quot; and the monotonous inquiry, &quot;How</p>
<p>do you do?&quot;--a question so meaningless that it seldom tarries for an</p>
<p>answer.  Under the new and more natural system of etiquette, when</p>
<p>you passed the time of day with a man you would know his business,</p>
<p>and the salutations of the market-place would be full of interest.</p>
<p>As for my chosen pursuit of angling (which I follow with diligence</p>
<p>when not interrupted by less important concerns), I rejoice with</p>
<p>every true fisherman that it has a greeting all its own and of a</p>
<p>most honourable antiquity.  There is no written record of its</p>
<p>origin.  But it is quite certain that since the days after the</p>
<p>Flood, when Deucalion</p>

<p>two honest and good-natured anglers have never met each other by the</p>
<p>way without crying out, &quot;What luck?&quot;</p>
<p>Here, indeed, is an epitome of the gentle art.  Here is the spirit</p>
<p>of it embodied in a word and paying its respects to you with its</p>
<p>native accent.  Here you see its secret charms unconsciously</p>
<p>disclosed.  The attraction of angling for all the ages of man, from</p>
<p>the cradle to the grave, lies in its uncertainty.  &#x27;Tis an affair of</p>
<p>luck.</p>
<p>No amount of preparation in the matter of rods and lines and hooks</p>
<p>and lures and nets and creels can change its essential character.</p>
<p>No excellence of skill in casting the delusive fly or adjusting the</p>
<p>tempting bait upon the hook can make the result secure.  You may</p>
<p>reduce the chances, but you cannot eliminate them.  There are a</p>
<p>thousand points at which fortune may intervene.  The state of the</p>
<p>weather, the height of the water, the appetite of the fish, the</p>
<p>presence or absence of other anglers--all these indeterminable</p>
<p>elements enter into the reckoning of your success.  There is no</p>
<p>combination of stars in the firmament by which you can forecast the</p>
<p>piscatorial future.  When you go a-fishing, you just take your</p>
<p>chances; you offer yourself as a candidate for anything that may be</p>
<p>going; you try your luck.</p>
<p>There are certain days that are favourites among anglers, who regard</p>
<p>them as propitious for the sport.  I know a man who believes that</p>
<p>the fish always rise better on Sunday than on any other day in the</p>
<p>week.  He complains bitterly of this supposed fact, because his</p>
<p>religious scruples will not allow him to take advantage of it.  He</p>
<p>confesses that he has sometimes thought seriously of joining the</p>
<p>Seventh-Day Baptists.</p>
<p>Among the Pennsylvania Dutch, in the Alleghany Mountains, I have</p>
<p>found a curious tradition that Ascension Day is the luckiest in the</p>
<p>year for fishing.  On that morning the district school is apt to he</p>
<p>thinly attended, and you must be on the stream very early if you do</p>
<p>not wish to find wet footprints on the stones ahead of you.</p>
<p>But in fact, all these superstitions about fortunate days are idle</p>
<p>and presumptuous.  If there were such days in the calendar, a kind</p>
<p>and firm Providence would never permit the race of man to discover</p>
<p>them.  It would rob life of one of its principal attractions, and</p>
<p>make fishing altogether too easy to be interesting.</p>
<p>Fisherman&#x27;s luck is so notorious that it has passed into a proverb.</p>
<p>But the fault with that familiar saying is that it is too short and</p>
<p>too narrow to cover half the variations of the angler&#x27;s possible</p>
<p>experience.  For if his luck should be bad, there is no portion of</p>
<p>his anatomy, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet,</p>
<p>that may not be thoroughly wet.  But if it should be good, he may</p>
<p>receive an unearned blessing of abundance not only in his basket,</p>
<p>but also in his head and his heart, his memory and his fancy.  He</p>
<p>may come home from some obscure, ill-named, lovely stream--some Dry</p>
<p>Brook, or Southwest Branch of Smith&#x27;s Run--with a creel full of</p>
<p>trout, and a mind full of grateful recollections of flowers that</p>
<p>seemed to bloom for his sake, and birds that sang a new, sweet,</p>
<p>friendly message to his tired soul.  He may climb down to &quot;Tommy&#x27;s</p>
<p>Rock&quot; below the cliffs at Newport (as I have done many a day with my</p>
<p>lady Greygown), and, all unnoticed by the idle, weary promenaders in</p>
<p>the path of fashion, haul in a basketful of blackfish, and at the</p>
<p>same time look out across the shining sapphire waters and inherit a</p>
<p>wondrous good fortune of dreams--</p>

<p>But all this, you must remember, depends upon something secret and</p>
<p>incalculable, something that we can neither command nor predict.  It</p>
<p>is an affair of gift, not of wages.  Fish (and the other good things</p>
<p>which are like sauce to the catching of them) cast no shadow before.</p>
<p>Water is the emblem of instability.  No one can tell what he shall</p>
<p>draw out of it until he has taken in his line.  Herein are found the</p>
<p>true charm and profit of angling for all persons of a pure and</p>
<p>childlike mind.</p>
<p>Look at those two venerable gentlemen floating in a skiff upon the</p>
<p>clear waters of Lake George.  One of them is a successful statesman,</p>
<p>an ex-President of the United States, a lawyer versed in all the</p>
<p>curious eccentricities of the &quot;lawless science of the law.&quot;  The</p>
<p>other is a learned doctor of medicine, able to give a name to all</p>
<p>diseases from which men have imagined that they suffered, and to</p>
<p>invent new ones for those who are tired of vulgar maladies.  But all</p>
<p>their learning is forgotten, their cares and controversies are laid</p>
<p>aside, in &quot;innocuous desuetude.&quot;  The Summer School of Sociology is</p>
<p>assembled.  The Medical Congress is in session.</p>
<p>But they care not--no, not so much as the value of a single live</p>
<p>bait.  The sun shines upon them with a fervent heat, but it irks</p>
<p>them not.  The rain descends, and the winds blow and beat upon them,</p>
<p>but they are unmoved.  They are securely anchored here in the lee of</p>
<p>Sabbath-Day Point.</p>
<p>What enchantment binds them to that inconsiderable spot?  What magic</p>
<p>fixes their eyes upon the point of a fishing-rod, as if it were the</p>
<p>finger of destiny?  It is the enchantment of uncertainty: the same</p>
<p>natural magic that draws the little suburban boys in the spring of</p>
<p>the year, with their strings and pin-hooks, around the shallow ponds</p>
<p>where dace and redfins hide; the same irresistible charm that fixes</p>
<p>a row of city gamins, like ragged and disreputable fish-crows, on</p>
<p>the end of a pier where blear-eyed flounders sometimes lurk in the</p>
<p>muddy water.  Let the philosopher explain it as he will.  Let the</p>
<p>moralist reprehend it as he chooses.  There is nothing that attracts</p>
<p>human nature more powerfully than the sport of tempting the unknown</p>
<p>with a fishing-line.</p>
<p>Those ancient anglers have set out upon an exodus from the tedious</p>
<p>realm of the definite, the fixed, the must-certainly-come-to-pass.</p>
<p>They are on a holiday in the free country of peradventure.  They do</p>
<p>not know at this moment whether the next turn of Fortune&#x27;s reel will</p>
<p>bring up a perch or a pickerel, a sunfish or a black bass.  It may</p>
<p>be a hideous catfish or a squirming eel, or it may be a lake-trout,</p>
<p>the grand prize in the Lake George lottery.  There they sit, those</p>
<p>gray-haired lads, full of hope, yet equally prepared for</p>
<p>resignation; taking no thought for the morrow, and ready to make the</p>
<p>best of to-day; harmless and happy players at the best of all games</p>
<p>of chance.</p>
<p>&quot;In other words,&quot; I hear some severe and sour-complexioned reader</p>
<p>say, &quot;in plain language, they are a pair of old gamblers.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, if it pleases you to call honest men by a bad name.  But they</p>
<p>risk nothing that is not their own; and if they lose, they are not</p>
<p>impoverished.  They desire nothing that belongs to other men; and if</p>
<p>they win, no one is robbed.  If all gambling were like that, it</p>
<p>would be difficult to see the harm in it.  Indeed, a daring moralist</p>
<p>might even assert, and prove by argument, that so innocent a delight</p>
<p>in the taking of chances is an aid to virtue.</p>
<p>Do you remember Martin Luther&#x27;s reasoning on the subject of</p>
<p>&quot;excellent large pike&quot;?  He maintains that God would never have</p>
<p>created them so good to the taste, if He had not meant them to be</p>
<p>eaten.  And for the same reason I conclude that this world would</p>
<p>never have been left so full of uncertainties, nor human nature</p>
<p>framed so as to find a peculiar joy and exhilaration in meeting them</p>
<p>bravely and cheerfully, if it had not been divinely intended that</p>
<p>most of our amusement and much of our education should come from</p>
<p>this source.</p>
<p>&quot;Chance&quot; is a disreputable word, I know.  It is supposed by many</p>
<p>pious persons to be improper and almost blasphemous to use it.  But</p>
<p>I am not one of those who share this verbal prejudice.  I am</p>
<p>inclined rather to believe that it is a good word to which a bad</p>
<p>reputation has been given.  I feel grateful to that admirable</p>
<p>&quot;psychologist who writes like a novelist,&quot; Mr. William James, for</p>
<p>his brilliant defence of it.  For what does it mean, after all, but</p>
<p>that some things happen in a certain way which might have happened</p>
<p>in another way?  Where is the immorality, the irreverence, the</p>
<p>atheism in such a supposition?  Certainly God must be competent to</p>
<p>govern a world in which there are possibilities of various kinds,</p>
<p>just as well as one in which every event is inevitably determined</p>
<p>beforehand.  St. Peter and the other fishermen-disciples on the Lake</p>
<p>of Galilee were perfectly free to cast their net on either side of</p>
<p>the ship.  So far as they could see, so far as any one could see, it</p>
<p>was a matter of chance where they chose to cast it.  But it was not</p>
<p>until they let it down, at the Master&#x27;s word, on the right side that</p>
<p>they had good luck.  And not the least element of their joy in the</p>
<p>draft of fishes was that it brought a change of fortune.</p>
<p>Leave the metaphysics of the question on the table for the present.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it is plain that our human nature is adapted to</p>
<p>conditions variable, undetermined, and hidden from our view.  We are</p>
<p>not fitted to live in a world where a + b always equals c, and there</p>
<p>is nothing more to follow.  The interest of life&#x27;s equation arrives</p>
<p>with the appearance of x, the unknown quantity.  A settled,</p>
<p>unchangeable, clearly foreseeable order of things does not suit our</p>
<p>constitution.  It tends to melancholy and a fatty heart.  Creatures</p>
<p>of habit we are undoubtedly; but it is one of our most fixed habits</p>
<p>to be fond of variety.  The man who is never surprised does not know</p>
<p>the taste of happiness, and unless the unexpected sometimes happens</p>
<p>to us, we are most grievously disappointed.</p>
<p>Much of the tediousness of highly civilized life comes from its</p>
<p>smoothness and regularity.  To-day is like yesterday, and we think</p>
<p>that we can predict to-morrow.  Of course we cannot really do so.</p>
<p>The chances are still there.  But we have covered them up so deeply</p>
<p>with the artificialities of life that we lose sight of them.  It</p>
<p>seems as if everything in our neat little world were arranged, and</p>
<p>provided for, and reasonably sure to come to pass.  The best way of</p>
<p>escape from this TAEDIUM VITAE is through a recreation like angling,</p>
<p>not only because it is so evidently a matter of luck, but also</p>
<p>because it tempts us into a wilder, freer life.  It leads almost</p>
<p>inevitably to camping out, which is a wholesome and sanitary</p>
<p>imprudence.</p>
<p>It is curious and pleasant, to my apprehension, to observe how many</p>
<p>people in New England, one of whose States is called &quot;the land of</p>
<p>Steady Habits,&quot; are sensible of the joy of changing them,--out of</p>
<p>doors.  These good folk turn out from their comfortable farm-houses</p>
<p>and their snug suburban cottages to go a-gypsying for a fortnight</p>
<p>among the mountains or beside the sea.  You see their white tents</p>
<p>gleaming from the pine-groves around the little lakes, and catch</p>
<p>glimpses of their bathing-clothes drying in the sun on the wiry</p>
<p>grass that fringes the sand-dunes.  Happy fugitives from the bondage</p>
<p>of routine!  They have found out that a long journey is not</p>
<p>necessary to a good vacation.  You may reach the Forest of Arden in</p>
<p>a buckboard.  The Fortunate Isles are within sailing distance in a</p>
<p>dory.  And a voyage on the river Pactolus is open to any one who can</p>
<p>paddle a canoe.</p>
<p>I was talking--or rather listening--with a barber, the other day, in</p>
<p>the sleepy old town of Rivermouth.  He told me, in one of those easy</p>
<p>confidences which seem to make the razor run more smoothly, that it</p>
<p>had been the custom of his family, for some twenty years past, to</p>
<p>forsake their commodious dwelling on Anchor Street every summer, and</p>
<p>emigrate six miles, in a wagon to Wallis Sands, where they spent the</p>
<p>month of August very merrily under canvas.  Here was a sensible</p>
<p>household for you!  They did not feel bound to waste a year&#x27;s income</p>
<p>on a four weeks&#x27; holiday.  They were not of those foolish folk who</p>
<p>run across the sea, carefully carrying with them the same tiresome</p>
<p>mind that worried them at home.  They got a change of air by making</p>
<p>an alteration of life.  They escaped from the land of Egypt by</p>
<p>stepping out into the wilderness and going a-fishing.</p>
<p>The people who always live in houses, and sleep on beds, and walk on</p>
<p>pavements, and buy their food from butchers and bakers and grocers,</p>
<p>are not the most blessed inhabitants of this wide and various earth.</p>
<p>The circumstances of their existence are too mathematical and secure</p>
<p>for perfect contentment.  They live at second or third hand.  They</p>
<p>are boarders in the world.  Everything is done for them by somebody</p>
<p>else.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible for anything very interesting to happen to</p>
<p>them.  They must get their excitement out of the newspapers, reading</p>
<p>of the hairbreadth escapes and moving accidents that befall people</p>
<p>in real life.  What do these tame ducks really know of the adventure</p>
<p>of living?  If the weather is bad, they are snugly housed.  If it is</p>
<p>cold, there is a furnace in the cellar.  If they are hungry, the</p>
<p>shops are near at hand.  It is all as dull, flat, stale, and</p>
<p>unprofitable as adding up a column of figures.  They might as well</p>
<p>be brought up in an incubator.</p>
<p>But when man abides in tents, after the manner of the early</p>
<p>patriarchs, the face of the world is renewed.  The vagaries of the</p>
<p>clouds become significant.  You watch the sky with a lover&#x27;s look,</p>
<p>eager to know whether it will smile or frown.  When you lie at night</p>
<p>upon your bed of boughs and hear the rain pattering on the canvas</p>
<p>close above your head, you wonder whether it is a long storm or only</p>
<p>a shower.</p>
<p>The rising wind shakes the tent-flaps.  Are the pegs well driven</p>
<p>down and the cords firmly fastened?  You fall asleep again and wake</p>
<p>later, to hear the rain drumming still more loudly on the tight</p>
<p>cloth, and the big breeze snoring through the forest, and the waves</p>
<p>plunging along the beach.  A stormy day?  Well, you must cut plenty</p>
<p>of wood and keep the camp-fire glowing, for it will be hard to start</p>
<p>it up again, if you let it get too low.  There is little use in</p>
<p>fishing or hunting in such a storm.  But there is plenty to do in</p>
<p>the camp: guns to be cleaned, tackle to be put in order, clothes to</p>
<p>be mended, a good story of adventure to be read, a belated letter to</p>
<p>be written to some poor wretch in a summer hotel, a game of hearts</p>
<p>or cribbage to be played, or a hunting-trip to be planned for the</p>
<p>return of fair weather.  The tent is perfectly dry.  A little trench</p>
<p>dug around it carries off the surplus water, and luckily it is</p>
<p>pitched with the side to the lake, so that you get the pleasant heat</p>
<p>of the fire without the unendurable smoke.  Cooking in the rain has</p>
<p>its disadvantages.  But how good the supper tastes when it is served</p>
<p>up on a tin plate, with an empty box for a table and a roll of</p>
<p>blankets at the foot of the bed for a seat!</p>
<p>A day, two days, three days, the storm may continue, according to</p>
<p>your luck.  I have been out in the woods for a fortnight without a</p>
<p>drop of rain or a sign of dust.  Again, I have tented on the shore</p>
<p>of a big lake for a week, waiting for an obstinate tempest to pass</p>
<p>by.</p>
<p>Look now, just at nightfall: is there not a little lifting and</p>
<p>breaking of the clouds in the west, a little shifting of the wind</p>
<p>toward a better quarter?  You go to bed with cheerful hopes.  A</p>
<p>dozen times in the darkness you are half awake, and listening</p>
<p>drowsily to the sounds of the storm.  Are they waxing or waning?  Is</p>
<p>that louder pattering a new burst of rain, or is it only the</p>
<p>plumping of the big drops as they are shaken from the trees?  See,</p>
<p>the dawn has come, and the gray light glimmers through the canvas.</p>
<p>In a little while you will know your fate.</p>
<p>Look!  There is a patch of bright yellow radiance on the peak of the</p>
<p>tent.  The shadow of a leaf dances over it.  The sun must be</p>
<p>shining.  Good luck! and up with you, for it is a glorious morning.</p>
<p>The woods are glistening as fresh and fair as if they had been new-</p>
<p>created overnight.  The water sparkles, and tiny waves are dancing</p>
<p>and splashing all along the shore.  Scarlet berries of the mountain-</p>
<p>ash hang around the lake.  A pair of kingfishers dart back and forth</p>
<p>across the bay, in flashes of living blue.  A black eagle swings</p>
<p>silently around his circle, far up in the cloudless sky.  The air is</p>
<p>full of pleasant sounds, but there is no noise.  The world is full</p>
<p>of joyful life, but there is no crowd and no confusion.  There is no</p>
<p>factory chimney to darken the day with its smoke, no trolley-car to</p>
<p>split the silence with its shriek and smite the indignant ear with</p>
<p>the clanging of its impudent bell.  No lumberman&#x27;s axe has robbed</p>
<p>the encircling forests of their glory of great trees.  No fires have</p>
<p>swept over the hills and left behind them the desolation of a</p>
<p>bristly landscape.  All is fresh and sweet, calm and clear and</p>
<p>bright.</p>
<p>&#x27;Twas rather a rude jest of Nature, that tempest of yesterday.  But</p>
<p>if you have taken it in good part, you are all the more ready for</p>
<p>her caressing mood to-day.  And now you must be off to get your</p>
<p>dinner--not to order it at a shop, but to look for it in the woods</p>
<p>and waters.  You are ready to do your best with rod or gun.  You</p>
<p>will use all the skill you have as hunter or fisherman.  But what</p>
<p>you shall find, and whether you shall subsist on bacon and biscuit,</p>
<p>or feast on trout and partridges, is, after all, a matter of luck.</p>
<p>I profess that it appears to me not only pleasant, but also</p>
<p>salutary, to be in this condition.  It brings us home to the plain</p>
<p>realities of life; it teaches us that a man ought to work before he</p>
<p>eats; it reminds us that, after he has done all he can, he must</p>
<p>still rely upon a mysterious bounty for his daily bread.  It says to</p>
<p>us, in homely and familiar words, that life was meant to be</p>
<p>uncertain, that no man can tell what a day will bring forth, and</p>
<p>that it is the part of wisdom to be prepared for disappointments and</p>
<p>grateful for all kinds of small mercies.</p>
<p>There is a story in that fragrant book, THE LITTLE FLOWERS OF ST.</p>
<p>FRANCIS, which I wish to transcribe here, without tying a moral to</p>
<p>it, lest any one should accuse me of preaching.</p>
<p>&quot;Hence [says the quaint old chronicler], having assigned to his</p>
<p>companions the other parts of the world, St. Francis, taking Brother</p>
<p>Maximus as his comrade, set forth toward the province of France.</p>
<p>And coming one day to a certain town, and being very hungry, they</p>
<p>begged their bread as they went, according to the rule of their</p>
<p>order, for the love of God.  And St. Francis went through one</p>
<p>quarter of the town, and Brother Maximus through another.  But</p>
<p>forasmuch as St. Francis was a man mean and low of stature, and</p>
<p>hence was reputed a vile beggar by such as knew him not, he only</p>
<p>received a few scanty crusts and mouthfuls of dry bread.  But to</p>
<p>Brother Maximus, who was large and well favoured, were given good</p>
<p>pieces and big, and an abundance of bread, yea, whole loaves.</p>
<p>Having thus begged, they met together without the town to eat, at a</p>
<p>place where there was a clear spring and a fair large stone, upon</p>
<p>which each spread forth the gifts that he had received.  And St.</p>
<p>Francis, seeing that the pieces of bread begged by Brother Maximus</p>
<p>were bigger and better than his own, rejoiced greatly, saying, &#x27;Oh,</p>
<p>Brother Maximus, we are not worthy of so great a treasure.&#x27;  As he</p>
<p>repeated these words many times, Brother Maximus made answer:</p>
<p>&#x27;Father, how can you talk of treasures when there is such great</p>
<p>poverty and such lack of all things needful?  Here is neither napkin</p>
<p>nor knife, neither board nor trencher, neither house nor table,</p>
<p>neither man-servant nor maid-servant.&#x27;  St. Francis replied: &#x27;And</p>
<p>this is what I reckon a great treasure, where naught is made ready</p>
<p>by human industry, but all that is here is prepared by Divine</p>
<p>Providence, as is plainly set forth in the bread which we have</p>
<p>begged, in the table of fair stone, and in the spring of clear</p>
<p>water.  And therefore I would that we should pray to God that He</p>
<p>teach us with all our hearts to love the treasure of holy poverty,</p>
<p>which is so noble a thing, and whose servant is God the Lord.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>I know of but one fairer description of a repast in the open air;</p>
<p>and that is where we are told how certain poor fishermen, coming in</p>
<p>very weary after a night of toil (and one of them very wet after</p>
<p>swimming ashore), found their Master standing on the bank of the</p>
<p>lake waiting for them.  But it seems that he must have been busy in</p>
<p>their behalf while he was waiting; for there was a bright fire of</p>
<p>coals burning on the shore, and a goodly fish broiling thereon, and</p>
<p>bread to eat with it.  And when the Master had asked them about</p>
<p>their fishing, he said, &quot;Come, now, and get your breakfast.&quot;  So</p>
<p>they sat down around the fire, and with his own hands he served them</p>
<p>with the bread and the fish.</p>
<p>Of all the banquets that have ever been given upon earth, that is</p>
<p>the one in which I would rather have had a share.</p>
<p>But it is now time that we should return to our fishing.  And let us</p>
<p>observe with gratitude that almost all of the pleasures that are</p>
<p>connected with this pursuit--its accompaniments and variations,</p>
<p>which run along with the tune and weave an embroidery of delight</p>
<p>around it--have an accidental and gratuitous quality about them.</p>
<p>They are not to be counted upon beforehand.  They are like something</p>
<p>that is thrown into a purchase by a generous and open-handed dealer,</p>
<p>to make us pleased with our bargain and inclined to come back to the</p>
<p>same shop.</p>
<p>If I knew, for example, before setting out for a day on the brook,</p>
<p>precisely what birds I should see, and what pretty little scenes in</p>
<p>the drama of woodland life were to be enacted before my eyes, the</p>
<p>expedition would lose more than half its charm.  But, in fact, it is</p>
<p>almost entirely a matter of luck, and that is why it never grows</p>
<p>tiresome.</p>
<p>The ornithologist knows pretty well where to look for the birds, and</p>
<p>he goes directly to the places where he can find them, and proceeds</p>
<p>to study them intelligently and systematically.  But the angler who</p>
<p>idles down the stream takes them as they come, and all his</p>
<p>observations have a flavour of surprise in them.</p>
<p>He hears a familiar song,--one that he has often heard at a</p>
<p>distance, but never identified,--a loud, cheery, rustic cadence</p>
<p>sounding from a low pine-tree close beside him.  He looks up</p>
<p>carefully through the needles and discovers a hooded warbler, a</p>
<p>tiny, restless creature, dressed in green and yellow, with two white</p>
<p>feathers in its tail, like the ends of a sash, and a glossy little</p>
<p>black bonnet drawn closely about its golden head.  He will never</p>
<p>forget that song again.  It will make the woods seem homelike to</p>
<p>him, many a time, as he hears it ringing through the afternoon, like</p>
<p>the call of a small country girl playing at hide-and-seek: &quot;See ME;</p>
<p>here I BE.&quot;</p>
<p>Another day he sits down on a mossy log beside a cold, trickling</p>
<p>spring to eat his lunch.  It has been a barren day for birds.</p>
<p>Perhaps he has fallen into the fault of pursuing his sport too</p>
<p>intensely, and tramped along the stream looking for nothing but</p>
<p>fish.  Perhaps this part of the grove has really been deserted by</p>
<p>its feathered inhabitants, scared away by a prowling hawk or driven</p>
<p>out by nest-hunters.  But now, without notice, the luck changes.  A</p>
<p>surprise-party of redstarts breaks into full play around him.  All</p>
<p>through the dark-green shadow of the hemlocks they flash like little</p>
<p>candles--CANDELITAS, the Cubans call them.  Their brilliant markings</p>
<p>of orange and black, and their fluttering, airy, graceful movements,</p>
<p>make them most welcome visitors.  There is no bird in the bush</p>
<p>easier to recognize or pleasanter to watch.  They run along the</p>
<p>branches and dart and tumble through the air in fearless chase of</p>
<p>invisible flies and moths.  All the time they keep unfolding and</p>
<p>furling their rounded tails, spreading them out and waving them and</p>
<p>closing them suddenly, just as the Cuban girls manage their fans.</p>
<p>In fact, the redstarts are the tiny fantail pigeons of the forest.</p>
<p>There are other things about the birds, besides their musical</p>
<p>talents and their good looks, that the fisherman has a chance to</p>
<p>observe on his lucky days.  He may sea something of their courage</p>
<p>and their devotion to their young.</p>
<p>I suppose a bird is the bravest creature that lives, in spite of its</p>
<p>natural timidity.  From which we may learn that true courage is not</p>
<p>incompatible with nervousness, and that heroism does not mean the</p>
<p>absence of fear, but the conquest of it.  Who does not remember the</p>
<p>first time that he ever came upon a hen-partridge with her brood, as</p>
<p>he was strolling through the woods in June?  How splendidly the old</p>
<p>bird forgets herself in her efforts to defend and hide her young!</p>
<p>Smaller birds are no less daring.  One evening last summer I was</p>
<p>walking up the Ristigouche from Camp Harmony to fish for salmon at</p>
<p>Mowett&#x27;s Rock, where my canoe was waiting for me.  As I stepped out</p>
<p>from a thicket on to the shingly bank of the river, a spotted</p>
<p>sandpiper teetered along before me, followed by three young ones.</p>
<p>Frightened at first, the mother flew out a few feet over the water.</p>
<p>But the piperlings could not fly, having no feathers; and they crept</p>
<p>under a crooked log.  I rolled the log over very gently and took one</p>
<p>of the cowering creatures into my hand--a tiny, palpitating scrap of</p>
<p>life, covered with soft gray down, and peeping shrilly, like a</p>
<p>Liliputian chicken.  And now the mother was transformed.  Her fear</p>
<p>was changed into fury.  She was a bully, a fighter, an Amazon in</p>
<p>feathers.  She flew at me with loud cries, dashing herself almost</p>
<p>into my face.  I was a tyrant, a robber, a kidnapper, and she called</p>
<p>heaven to witness that she would never give up her offspring without</p>
<p>a struggle.  Then she changed her tactics and appealed to my baser</p>
<p>passions.  She fell to the ground and fluttered around me as if her</p>
<p>wing were broken.  &quot;Look!&quot; she seemed to say, &quot;I am bigger than that</p>
<p>poor little baby.  If you must eat something, eat me!  My wing is</p>
<p>lame.  I can&#x27;t fly.  You can easily catch me.  Let that little bird</p>
<p>go!&quot;  And so I did; and the whole family disappeared in the bushes</p>
<p>as if by magic.  I wondered whether the mother was saying to</p>
<p>herself, after the manner of her sex, that men are stupid things,</p>
<p>after all, and no match for the cleverness of a female who stoops to</p>
<p>deception in a righteous cause.</p>
<p>Now, that trivial experience was what I call a piece of good luck--</p>
<p>for me, and, in the event, for the sandpiper.  But it is doubtful</p>
<p>whether it would be quite so fresh and pleasant in the remembrance,</p>
<p>if it had not also fallen to my lot to take two uncommonly good</p>
<p>salmon on that same evening, in a dry season.</p>
<p>Never believe a fisherman when he tells you that he does not care</p>
<p>about the fish he catches.  He may say that he angles only for the</p>
<p>pleasure of being out-of-doors, and that he is just as well</p>
<p>contented when he takes nothing as when he makes a good catch.  He</p>
<p>may think so, but it is not true.  He is not telling a deliberate</p>
<p>falsehood.  He is only assuming an unconscious pose, and indulging</p>
<p>in a delicate bit of self-flattery.  Even if it were true, it would</p>
<p>not be at all to his credit.</p>
<p>Watch him on that lucky day when he comes home with a full basket of</p>
<p>trout on his shoulder, or a quartette of silver salmon covered with</p>
<p>green branches in the bottom of the canoe.  His face is broader than</p>
<p>it was when he went out, and there is a sparkle of triumph in his</p>
<p>eye.  &quot;It is naught, it is naught,&quot; he says, in modest depreciation</p>
<p>of his triumph.  But you shall see that he lingers fondly about the</p>
<p>place where the fish are displayed upon the grass, and does not fail</p>
<p>to look carefully at the scales when they are weighed, and has an</p>
<p>attentive ear for the comments of admiring spectators.  You shall</p>
<p>find, moreover, that he is not unwilling to narrate the story of the</p>
<p>capture--how the big fish rose short, four times, to four different</p>
<p>flies, and finally took a small Black Dose, and played all over the</p>
<p>pool, and ran down a terribly stiff rapid to the next pool below,</p>
<p>and sulked for twenty minutes, and had to be stirred up with stones,</p>
<p>and made such a long fight that, when he came in at last, the hold</p>
<p>of the hook was almost worn through, and it fell out of his mouth as</p>
<p>he touched the shore.  Listen to this tale as it is told, with</p>
<p>endless variations, by every man who has brought home a fine fish,</p>
<p>and you will perceive that the fisherman does care for his luck,</p>
<p>after all.</p>
<p>And why not?  I am no friend to the people who receive the bounties</p>
<p>of Providence without visible gratitude.  When the sixpence falls</p>
<p>into your hat, you may laugh.  When the messenger of an unexpected</p>
<p>blessing takes you by the hand and lifts you up and bids you walk,</p>
<p>you may leap and run and sing for joy, even as the lame man, whom</p>
<p>St. Peter healed, skipped piously and rejoiced aloud as he passed</p>
<p>through the Beautiful Gate of the Temple.  There is no virtue in</p>
<p>solemn indifference.  Joy is just as much a duty as beneficence is.</p>
<p>Thankfulness is the other side of mercy.</p>
<p>When you have good luck in anything, you ought to be glad.  Indeed,</p>
<p>if you are not glad, you are not really lucky.</p>
<p>But boasting and self-glorification I would have excluded, and most</p>
<p>of all from the behaviour of the angler.  He, more than other men,</p>
<p>is dependent for his success upon the favour of an unseen</p>
<p>benefactor.  Let his skill and industry be never so great, he can do</p>
<p>nothing unless LA BONNE CHANCE comes to him.</p>
<p>I was once fishing on a fair little river, the P&#x27;tit Saguenay, with</p>
<p>two excellent anglers and pleasant companions, H. E. G---- and C. S.</p>
<p>D----.  They had done all that was humanly possible to secure good</p>
<p>sport.  The stream had been well preserved.  They had boxes full of</p>
<p>beautiful flies, and casting-lines imported from England, and a rod</p>
<p>for every fish in the river.  But the weather was &quot;dour,&quot; and the</p>
<p>water &quot;drumly,&quot; and every day the lumbermen sent a &quot;drive&quot; of ten</p>
<p>thousand spruce logs rushing down the flooded stream.  For three</p>
<p>days we had not seen a salmon, and on the fourth, despairing, we</p>
<p>went down to angle for sea-trout in the tide of the greater</p>
<p>Saguenay.  There, in the salt water, where men say the salmon never</p>
<p>take the fly, H. E. G----, fishing with a small trout-rod, a poor,</p>
<p>short line, and an ancient red ibis of the common kind, rose and</p>
<p>hooked a lordly salmon of at least five-and-thirty pounds.  Was not</p>
<p>this pure luck?</p>
<p>Pride is surely the most unbecoming of all vices in a fisherman.</p>
<p>For though intelligence and practice and patience and genius, and</p>
<p>many other noble things which modesty forbids him to mention, enter</p>
<p>into his pastime, so that it is, as Izaak Walton has firmly</p>
<p>maintained, an art; yet, because fortune still plays a controlling</p>
<p>hand in the game, its net results should never be spoken of with a</p>
<p>haughty and vain spirit.  Let not the angler imitate Timoleon, who</p>
<p>boasted of his luck and lost it.  It is tempting Providence to print</p>
<p>the record of your wonderful catches in the sporting newspapers; or</p>
<p>at least, if it must be done, there should stand at the head of the</p>
<p>column some humble, thankful motto, like &quot;NON NOBIS, DOMINE.&quot;  Even</p>
<p>Father Izaak, when he has a fish on his line, says, with a due sense</p>
<p>of human limitations, &quot;There is a trout now, and a good one too, IF</p>
<p>I CAN BUT HOLD HIM!&quot;</p>
<p>This reminds me that we left H. E. G----, a few sentences back,</p>
<p>playing his unexpected salmon, on a trout-rod, in the Saguenay.</p>
<p>Four times that great fish leaped into the air; twice he suffered</p>
<p>the pliant reed to guide him toward the shore, and twice ran out</p>
<p>again to deeper water.  Then his spirit awoke within him: he bent</p>
<p>the rod like a willow wand, dashed toward the middle of the river,</p>
<p>broke the line as if it had been pack-thread, and sailed</p>
<p>triumphantly away to join the white porpoises that were tumbling in</p>
<p>the tide.  &quot;WHE-E-EW,&quot; they said, &quot;WHE-E-EW! PSHA-A-AW!&quot; blowing out</p>
<p>their breath in long, soft sighs as they rolled about like huge</p>
<p>snowballs in the black water.  But what did H. E. G---- say?  He sat</p>
<p>him quietly down upon a rock and reeled in the remnant of his line,</p>
<p>uttering these remarkable and Christian words: &quot;Those porpoises,</p>
<p>said he, &quot;describe the situation rather mildly.  But it was good fun</p>
<p>while it lasted.&quot;</p>
<p>Again I remembered a saying of Walton: &quot;Well, Scholar, you must</p>
<p>endure worse luck sometimes, or you will never make a good angler.&quot;</p>
<p>Or a good man, either, I am sure.  For he who knows only how to</p>
<p>enjoy, and not to endure, is ill-fitted to go down the stream of</p>
<p>life through such a world as this.</p>
<p>I would not have you to suppose, gentle reader, that in discoursing</p>
<p>of fisherman&#x27;s luck I have in mind only those things which may be</p>
<p>taken with a hook.  It is a parable of human experience.  I have</p>
<p>been thinking, for instance, of Walton&#x27;s life as well as of his</p>
<p>angling: of the losses and sufferings that he, the firm Royalist,</p>
<p>endured when the Commonwealth men came marching into London town; of</p>
<p>the consoling days that were granted to him, in troublous times, on</p>
<p>the banks of the Lea and the Dove and the New River, and the good</p>
<p>friends that he made there, with whom he took sweet counsel in</p>
<p>adversity; of the little children who played in his house for a few</p>
<p>years, and then were called away into the silent land where he could</p>
<p>hear their voices no longer.  I was thinking how quietly and</p>
<p>peaceably he lived through it all, not complaining nor desponding,</p>
<p>but trying to do his work well, whether he was keeping a shop or</p>
<p>writing hooks, and seeking to prove himself an honest man and a</p>
<p>cheerful companion, and never scorning to take with a thankful heart</p>
<p>such small comforts and recreations as came to him.</p>
<p>It is a plain, homely, old-fashioned meditation, reader, but not</p>
<p>unprofitable.  When I talk to you of fisherman&#x27;s luck, I do not</p>
<p>forget that there are deeper things behind it.  I remember that what</p>
<p>we call our fortunes, good or ill, are but the wise dealings and</p>
<p>distributions of a Wisdom higher, and a Kindness greater, than our</p>
<p>own.  And I suppose that their meaning is that we should learn, by</p>
<p>all the uncertainties of our life, even the smallest, how to be</p>
<p>brave and steady and temperate and hopeful, whatever comes, because</p>
<p>we believe that behind it all there lies a purpose of good, and over</p>
<p>it all there watches a providence of blessing.</p>
<p>In the school of life many branches of knowledge are taught.  But</p>
<p>the only philosophy that amounts to anything, after all, is just the</p>
<p>secret of making friends with our luck.</p>
<p>THE THRILLING MOMENT</p>
<p>&quot;In angling, as in all other recreations into which excitement</p>
<p>enters, we have to be on our guard, so that we can at any moment</p>
<p>throw a weight of self-control into the scale against misfortune;</p>
<p>and happily we can study to some purpose, both to increase our</p>
<p>pleasure in success and to lessen our distress caused by what goes</p>
<p>ill.  It is not only in cases of great disasters, however, that the</p>
<p>angler needs self-control.  He is perpetually called upon to use it</p>
<p>to withstand small exasperations.&quot;--SIR EDWARD GREY: Fly-Fishing.</p>
<p>Every moment of life, I suppose, is more or less of a turning-point.</p>
<p>Opportunities are swarming around us all the time, thicker than</p>
<p>gnats at sundown.  We walk through a cloud of chances, and if we</p>
<p>were always conscious of them they would worry us almost to death.</p>
<p>But happily our sense of uncertainty is soothed and cushioned by</p>
<p>habit, so that we can live comfortably with it.  Only now and then,</p>
<p>by way of special excitement, it starts up wide awake.  We perceive</p>
<p>how delicately our fortune is poised and balanced on the pivot of a</p>
<p>single incident.  We get a peep at the oscillating needle, and,</p>
<p>because we have happened to see it tremble, we call our experience a</p>
<p>crisis.</p>
<p>The meditative angler is not exempt from these sensational periods.</p>
<p>There are times when all the uncertainty of his chosen pursuit seems</p>
<p>to condense itself into one big chance, and stand out before him</p>
<p>like a salmon on the top wave of a rapid.  He sees that his luck</p>
<p>hangs by a single strand, and he cannot tell whether it will hold or</p>
<p>break.  This is his thrilling moment, and he never forgets it.</p>
<p>Mine came to me in the autumn of 1894, on the banks of the</p>
<p>Unpronounceable River, in the Province of Quebec.  It was the last</p>
<p>day, of the open season for ouananiche, and we had set our hearts on</p>
<p>catching some good fish to take home with us.  We walked up from the</p>
<p>mouth of the river, four preposterously long and rough miles, to the</p>
<p>famous fishing-pool, &quot;LA PLACE DE PECHE A BOIVIN.&quot;  It was a noble</p>
<p>day for walking; the air was clear and crisp, and all the hills</p>
<p>around us were glowing with the crimson foliage of those little</p>
<p>bushes which God created to make burned lands look beautiful.  The</p>
<p>trail ended in a precipitous gully, down which we scrambled with</p>
<p>high hopes, and fishing-rods unbroken, only to find that the river</p>
<p>was in a condition which made angling absurd if not impossible.</p>
<p>There must have been a cloud-burst among the mountains, for the</p>
<p>water was coming down in flood.  The stream was bank-full, gurgling</p>
<p>and eddying out among the bushes, and rushing over the shoal where</p>
<p>the fish used to lie, in a brown torrent ten feet deep.  Our last</p>
<p>day with the land-locked salmon seemed destined to be a failure, and</p>
<p>we must wait eight months before we could have another.  There were</p>
<p>three of us in the disappointment, and we shared it according to our</p>
<p>temperaments.</p>
<p>Paul virtuously resolved not to give up while there was a chance</p>
<p>left, and wandered down-stream to look for an eddy where he might</p>
<p>pick up a small fish.  Ferdinand, our guide, resigned himself</p>
<p>without a sigh to the consolation of eating blueberries, which he</p>
<p>always did with great cheerfulness.  But I, being more cast down</p>
<p>than either of my comrades, sought out a convenient seat among the</p>
<p>rocks, and, adapting my anatomy as well as possible to the</p>
<p>irregularities of nature&#x27;s upholstery, pulled from my pocket AN</p>
<p>AMATEUR ANGLER&#x27;S DAYS IN DOVE DALE, and settled down to read myself</p>
<p>into a Christian frame of mind.</p>
<p>Before beginning, my eyes roved sadly over the pool once more.  It</p>
<p>was but a casual glance.  It lasted only for an instant.  But in</p>
<p>that fortunate fragment of time I distinctly saw the broad tail of a</p>
<p>big ouananiche rise and disappear in the swift water at the very</p>
<p>head of the pool.</p>
<p>Immediately the whole aspect of affairs was changed.  Despondency</p>
<p>vanished, and the river glittered with the beams of rising hope.</p>
<p>Such is the absurd disposition of some anglers.  They never see a</p>
<p>fish without believing that they can catch him; but if they see no</p>
<p>fish, they are inclined to think that the river is empty and the</p>
<p>world hollow.</p>
<p>I said nothing to my companions.  It would have been unkind to</p>
<p>disturb them with expectations which might never be realized.  My</p>
<p>immediate duty was to get within casting distance of that salmon as</p>
<p>soon as possible.</p>
<p>The way along the shore of the pool was difficult.  The bank was</p>
<p>very steep, and the rocks by the river&#x27;s edge were broken and</p>
<p>glibbery.  Presently I came to a sheer wall of stone, perhaps thirty</p>
<p>feet high, rising directly from the deep water.</p>
<p>There was a tiny ledge or crevice running part of the way across the</p>
<p>face of this wall, and by this four-inch path I edged along, holding</p>
<p>my rod in one hand, and clinging affectionately with the other to</p>
<p>such clumps of grass and little bushes as I could find.  There was</p>
<p>one small huckleberry plant to which I had a particular attachment.</p>
<p>It was fortunately a firm little bush, and as I held fast to it I</p>
<p>remembered Tennyson&#x27;s poem which begins</p>
<p>&quot;Flower in the crannied wall,&quot;</p>
<p>and reflected that if I should succeed in plucking out this flower,</p>
<p>&quot;root and all,&quot; it would probably result in an even greater increase</p>
<p>of knowledge than the poet contemplated.</p>
<p>The ledge in the rock now came to an end.  But below me in the pool</p>
<p>there was a sunken reef; and on this reef a long log had caught,</p>
<p>with one end sticking out of the water, within jumping distance.  It</p>
<p>was the only chance.  To go back would have been dangerous.  An</p>
<p>angler with a large family dependent upon him for support has no</p>
<p>right to incur unnecessary perils.</p>
<p>Besides, the fish was waiting for me at the upper end of the pool!</p>
<p>So I jumped; landed on the end of the log; felt it settle slowly</p>
<p>down; ran along it like a small boy on a seesaw, and leaped off into</p>
<p>shallow water just as the log rolled from the ledge and lunged out</p>
<p>into the stream.</p>
<p>It went wallowing through the pool and down the rapid like a playful</p>
<p>hippopotamus.  I watched it with interest and congratulated myself</p>
<p>that I was no longer embarked upon it.  On that craft a voyage down</p>
<p>the Unpronounceable River would have been short but far from merry.</p>
<p>The &quot;all ashore&quot; bell was not rung early enough.  I just got off,</p>
<p>with not half a second to spare.</p>
<p>But now all was well, for I was within reach of the fish.  A little</p>
<p>scrambling over the rocks brought me to a point where I could easily</p>
<p>cast over him.  He was lying in a swift, smooth, narrow channel</p>
<p>between two large stones.  It was a snug resting-place, and no doubt</p>
<p>he would remain there for some time.  So I took out my fly-book and</p>
<p>prepared to angle for him according to the approved rules of the</p>
<p>art.</p>
<p>Nothing is more foolish in sport than the habit of precipitation.</p>
<p>And yet it is a fault to which I am singularly subject.  As a boy,</p>
<p>in Brooklyn, I never came in sight of the Capitoline Skating Pond,</p>
<p>after a long ride in the horse-cars, without breaking into a run</p>
<p>along the board walk, buckling on my skates in a furious hurry, and</p>
<p>flinging myself impetuously upon the ice, as if I feared that it</p>
<p>would melt away before I could reach it.  Now this, I confess, is a</p>
<p>grievous defect, which advancing years have not entirely cured; and</p>
<p>I found it necessary to take myself firmly, as it were, by the</p>
<p>mental coat-collar, and resolve not to spoil the chance of catching</p>
<p>the only ouananiche in the Unpronounceable River by undue haste in</p>
<p>fishing for him.</p>
<p>I carefully tested a brand-new leader, and attached it to the line</p>
<p>with great deliberation and the proper knot.  Then I gave my whole</p>
<p>mind to the important question of a wise selection of flies.</p>
<p>It is astonishing how much time and mental anxiety a man can spend</p>
<p>on an apparently simple question like this.  When you are buying</p>
<p>flies in a shop it seems as if you never had half enough.  You keep</p>
<p>on picking out a half-dozen of each new variety as fast as the</p>
<p>enticing salesman shows them to you.  You stroll through the streets</p>
<p>of Montreal or Quebec and drop in at every fishing-tackle dealer&#x27;s</p>
<p>to see whether you can find a few more good flies.  Then, when you</p>
<p>come to look over your collection at the critical moment on the bank</p>
<p>of a stream, it seems as if you had ten times too many.  And, spite</p>
<p>of all, the precise fly that you need is not there.</p>
<p>You select a couple that you think fairly good, lay them down beside</p>
<p>you in the grass, and go on looking through the book for something</p>
<p>better.  Failing to satisfy yourself, you turn to pick up those that</p>
<p>you have laid out, and find that they have mysteriously vanished</p>
<p>from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Then you struggle with naughty words and relapse into a condition of</p>
<p>mental palsy.</p>
<p>Precipitation is a fault.  But deliberation, for a person of</p>
<p>precipitate disposition, is a vice.</p>
<p>The best thing to do in such a case is to adopt some abstract theory</p>
<p>of action without delay, and put it into practice without</p>
<p>hesitation.  Then if you fail, you can throw the responsibility on</p>
<p>the theory.</p>
<p>Now, in regard to flies there are two theories.  The old,</p>
<p>conservative theory is, that on a bright day you should use a dark,</p>
<p>dull fly, because it is less conspicuous.  So I followed that theory</p>
<p>first and put on a Great Dun and a Dark Montreal.  I cast them</p>
<p>delicately over the fish, but he would not look at them.</p>
<p>Then I perverted myself to the new, radical theory which says that</p>
<p>on a bright day you must use a light, gay fly, because it is more in</p>
<p>harmony with the sky, and therefore less noticeable.  Accordingly I</p>
<p>put on a Professor and a Parmacheene Belle; but this combination of</p>
<p>learning and beauty had no attraction for the ouananiche.</p>
<p>Then I fell back on a theory of my own, to the effect that the</p>
<p>ouananiche have an aversion to red, and prefer yellow and brown.  So</p>
<p>I tried various combinations of flies in which these colours</p>
<p>predominated.</p>
<p>Then I abandoned all theories and went straight through my book,</p>
<p>trying something from every page, and winding up with that lure</p>
<p>which the guides consider infallible,--&quot;a Jock o&#x27; Scott that cost</p>
<p>fifty cents at Quebec.&quot;  But it was all in vain.  I was ready to</p>
<p>despair.</p>
<p>At this psychological moment I heard behind me a voice of hope,--the</p>
<p>song of a grasshopper: not one of those fat-legged, green-winged</p>
<p>imbeciles that feebly tumble in the summer fields, but a game</p>
<p>grasshopper,--one of those thin-shanked, brown-winged fellows that</p>
<p>leap like kangaroos, and fly like birds, and sing KRI-KAREE-KAREE-</p>
<p>KRI in their flight.</p>
<p>It is not really a song, I know, but it sounds like one; and, if you</p>
<p>had heard that Kri-karee carolling as I chased him over the rocks,</p>
<p>you would have been sure that he was mocking me.</p>
<p>I believed that he was the predestined lure for that ouananiche; but</p>
<p>it was hard to persuade him to fulfill his destiny.  I slapped at</p>
<p>him with my hat, but he was not there.  I grasped at him on the</p>
<p>bushes, and brought away &quot;nothing but leaves.&quot;  At last he made his</p>
<p>way to the very edge of the water and poised himself on a stone,</p>
<p>with his legs well tucked in for a long leap and a bold flight to</p>
<p>the other side of the river.  It was my final opportunity.  I made a</p>
<p>desperate grab at it and caught the grasshopper.</p>
<p>My premonition proved to be correct.  When that Kri-karee, invisibly</p>
<p>attached to my line, went floating down the stream, the ouananiche</p>
<p>was surprised.  It was the fourteenth of September, and he had</p>
<p>supposed the grasshopper season was over.  The unexpected temptation</p>
<p>was too strong for him.  He rose with a rush, and in an instant I</p>
<p>was fast to the best land-locked salmon of the year.</p>
<p>But the situation was not without its embarrassments.  My rod</p>
<p>weighed only four and a quarter ounces; the fish weighed between six</p>
<p>and seven pounds.  The water was furious and headstrong.  I had only</p>
<p>thirty yards of line and no landing-net.</p>
<p>&quot;HOLA!  FERDINAND!&quot; I cried.  &quot;APPORTE LA NETTE, VITE!  A BEAUTY!</p>
<p>HURRY UP!&quot;</p>
<p>I thought it must be an hour while he was making his way over the</p>
<p>hill, through the underbrush, around the cliff.  Again and again the</p>
<p>fish ran out my line almost to the last turn.  A dozen times he</p>
<p>leaped from the water, shaking his silvery sides.  Twice he tried to</p>
<p>cut the leader across a sunken ledge.  But at last he was played</p>
<p>out, and came in quietly towards the point of the rock.  At the same</p>
<p>moment Ferdinand appeared with the net.</p>
<p>Now, the use of the net is really the most difficult part of</p>
<p>angling.  And Ferdinand is the best netsman in the Lake St. John</p>
<p>country.  He never makes the mistake of trying to scoop a fish in</p>
<p>motion.  He does not grope around with aimless, futile strokes as if</p>
<p>he were feeling for something in the dark.  He does not entangle the</p>
<p>dropper-fly in the net and tear the tail-fly out of the fish&#x27;s</p>
<p>mouth.  He does not get excited.</p>
<p>He quietly sinks the net in the water, and waits until he can see</p>
<p>the fish distinctly, lying perfectly still and within reach.  Then</p>
<p>he makes a swift movement, like that of a mower swinging the scythe,</p>
<p>takes the fish into the net head-first, and lands him without a</p>
<p>slip.</p>
<p>I felt sure that Ferdinand was going to do the trick in precisely</p>
<p>this way with my ouananiche.  Just at the right instant he made one</p>
<p>quick, steady swing of the arms, and--the head of the net broke</p>
<p>clean off the handle and went floating away with the fish in it!</p>
<p>All seemed to be lost.  But Ferdinand was equal to the occasion.  He</p>
<p>seized a long, crooked stick that lay in a pile of driftwood on the</p>
<p>shore, sprang into the water up to his waist, caught the net as it</p>
<p>drifted past, and dragged it to land, with the ultimate ouananiche,</p>
<p>the prize of the season, still glittering through its meshes.</p>
<p>This is the story of my most thrilling moment as an angler.</p>
<p>But which was the moment of the deepest thrill?</p>
<p>Was it when the huckleberry bush saved me from a watery grave, or</p>
<p>when the log rolled under my feet and started down the river?  Was</p>
<p>it when the fish rose, or when the net broke, or when the long stick</p>
<p>captured it?</p>
<p>No, it was none of these.  It was when the Kri-karee sat with his</p>
<p>legs tucked under him on the brink of the stream.  That was the</p>
<p>turning-point.  The fortunes of the day depended on the comparative</p>
<p>quickness of the reflex action of his neural ganglia and mine.  That</p>
<p>was the thrilling moment.</p>
<p>I see it now.  A crisis is really the commonest thing in the world.</p>
<p>The reason why life sometimes seems dull to us is because we do not</p>
<p>perceive the importance and the excitement of getting bait.</p>
<p>TALKABILITY</p>
<p>A PRELUDE AND THEME WITH VARIATIONS</p>
<p>&quot;He praises a meditative life, and with evident sincerity: but we</p>
<p>feel that he liked nothing so well as good talk.&quot;--JAMES RUSSELL</p>
<p>LOWELL: Walton.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>PRELUDE--ON AN OLD, FOOLISH MAXIM</p>
<p>The inventor of the familiar maxim that &quot;fishermen must not talk&quot; is</p>
<p>lost in the mists of antiquity, and well deserves his fate.  For a</p>
<p>more foolish rule, a conventionality more obscure and aimless in its</p>
<p>tyranny, was never imposed upon an innocent and honourable</p>
<p>occupation, to diminish its pleasure and discount its profits.  Why,</p>
<p>in the name of all that is genial, should anglers go about their</p>
<p>harmless sport in stealthy silence like conspirators, or sit</p>
<p>together in a boat, dumb, glum, and penitential, like naughty</p>
<p>schoolboys on the bench of disgrace?  &#x27;Tis an Omorcan superstition;</p>
<p>a rule without a reason; a venerable, idiotic fashion invented to</p>
<p>repress lively spirits and put a premium on stupidity.</p>
<p>For my part, I incline rather to the opinion of the Neapolitan</p>
<p>fishermen who maintain that a certain amount of noise, of certain</p>
<p>kinds, is likely to improve the fishing, and who have a particular</p>
<p>song, very sweet and charming, which they sing to draw the fishes</p>
<p>around them.  It is narrated, likewise, of the good St. Brandan,</p>
<p>that on his notable voyage from Ireland in search of Paradise, he</p>
<p>chanted the service for St. Peter&#x27;s day so pleasantly that a</p>
<p>subaqueous audience of all sorts and sizes was attracted, insomuch</p>
<p>that the other monks began to be afraid, and begged the abbot that</p>
<p>he would sing a little lower, for they were not quite sure of the</p>
<p>intention of the congregation.  Of St. Anthony of Padua it is said</p>
<p>that he even succeeded in persuading the fishes, in great</p>
<p>multitudes, to listen to a sermon; and that when it was ended (it</p>
<p>must be noted that it was both short and cheerful) they bowed their</p>
<p>heads and moved their bodies up and down with every mark of fondness</p>
<p>and approval of what the holy father had spoken.</p>
<p>If we can believe this, surely we need not be incredulous of things</p>
<p>which seem to be no less, but rather more, in harmony with the</p>
<p>course of nature.  Creatures who are sensible to the attractions of</p>
<p>a sermon can hardly be indifferent to the charm of other kinds of</p>
<p>discourse.  I can easily imagine a company of grayling wishing to</p>
<p>overhear a conversation between I. W. and his affectionate (but</p>
<p>somewhat prodigal) son and servant, Charles Cotton; and surely every</p>
<p>intelligent salmon in Scotland might have been glad to hear</p>
<p>Christopher North and the Ettrick Shepherd bandy jests and swap</p>
<p>stories.  As for trout,--was there one in Massachusetts that would</p>
<p>not have been curious to listen to the intimate opinions of Daniel</p>
<p>Webster as he loafed along the banks of the Marshpee,--or is there</p>
<p>one in Pennsylvania to-day that might not be drawn with interest and</p>
<p>delight to the feet of Joseph Jefferson, telling how he conceived</p>
<p>and wrote RIP VAN WINKLE on the banks of a trout-stream?</p>
<p>Fishermen must be silent?  On the contrary, it is far more likely</p>
<p>that good talk may promote good fishing.</p>
<p>All this, however, goes upon the assumption that fish can hear, in</p>
<p>the proper sense of the word.  And this, it must be confessed, is an</p>
<p>assumption not yet fully verified.  Experienced anglers and students</p>
<p>of fishy ways are divided upon the question.  It is beyond a doubt</p>
<p>that all fishes, except the very lowest forms, have ears.  But then</p>
<p>so have all men; and yet we have the best authority for believing</p>
<p>that there are many who &quot;having ears, hear not.&quot;</p>
<p>The ears of fishes, for the most part, are inclosed in their skull,</p>
<p>and have no outward opening.  Water conveys sound, as every country</p>
<p>boy knows who has tried the experiment of diving to the bottom of</p>
<p>the swimming-hole and knocking two big stones together.  But I doubt</p>
<p>whether any country boy, engaged in this interesting scientific</p>
<p>experiment, has heard the conversation of his friends on the bank</p>
<p>who were engaged in hiding his clothes.</p>
<p>There are many curious and more or less venerable stories to the</p>
<p>effect that fishes may be trained to assemble at the ringing of a</p>
<p>bell or the beating of a drum.  Lucian, a writer of the second</p>
<p>century, tells of a certain lake wherein many sacred fishes were</p>
<p>kept, of which the largest had names given to them, and came when</p>
<p>they were called.  But Lucian was not a man of especially good</p>
<p>reputation, and there is an air of improbability about his statement</p>
<p>that the LARGEST fishes came.  This is not the custom of the largest</p>
<p>fishes.</p>
<p>In the present century there was a tale of an eel in a garden-well,</p>
<p>in Scotland, which would come to be fed out of a spoon when the</p>
<p>children called him by his singularly inappropriate name of Rob Roy.</p>
<p>This seems a more likely story than Lucian&#x27;s; at all events it comes</p>
<p>from a more orthodox atmosphere.  But before giving it full</p>
<p>credence, I should like to know whether the children, when they</p>
<p>called &quot;Rob Roy!&quot; stood where the eel could see the spoon.</p>
<p>On the other side of the question, we may quote Mr. Ronalds, also a</p>
<p>Scotchman, and the learned author of THE FLY-FISHER&#x27;S ENTOMOLOGY,</p>
<p>who conducted a series of experiments which proved that even trout,</p>
<p>the most fugacious of fish, are not in the least disturbed by the</p>
<p>discharge of a gun, provided the flash is concealed.  Mr. Henry P.</p>
<p>Wells, the author of THE AMERICAN SALMON ANGLER, says that he has</p>
<p>&quot;never been able to make a sound in the air which seemed to produce</p>
<p>the slightest effect upon trout in the water.&quot;</p>
<p>So the controversy on the hearing of fishes continues, and the</p>
<p>conclusion remains open.  Every man is at liberty to embrace that</p>
<p>side which pleases him best.  You may think that the finny tribes</p>
<p>are as sensitive to sound as Fine Ear, in the German fairy-tale, who</p>
<p>could hear the grass grow.  Or you may hold the opposite opinion,</p>
<p>that they are</p>

<p>But whichever theory you adopt, in practice, if you are a wise</p>
<p>fisherman, you will steer a middle course, between one thing which</p>
<p>must be left undone and another thing which should be done.  You</p>
<p>will refrain from stamping on the bank, or knocking on the side of</p>
<p>the boat, or dragging the anchor among the stones on the bottom; for</p>
<p>when the water vibrates the fish are likely to vanish.  But you will</p>
<p>indulge as freely as you please in pleasant discourse with your</p>
<p>comrade; for it is certain that fishing is never hindered, and may</p>
<p>even be helped, in one way or another, by good talk.</p>
<p>I should therefore have no hesitation in advising any one to choose,</p>
<p>for companionship on an angling expedition, long or short, a person</p>
<p>who has the rare merit of being TALKABLE.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>THEME--ON A SMALL, USEFUL VIRTUE</p>
<p>&quot;Talkable&quot; is not a new adjective.  But it needs a new definition,</p>
<p>and the complement of a corresponding noun.  I would fain set down</p>
<p>on paper some observations and reflections which may serve to make</p>
<p>its meaning clear, and render due praise to that most excellent</p>
<p>quality in man or woman,--especially in anglers,--the small but</p>
<p>useful virtue of TALKABILITY.</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson uses the word &quot;talkable&quot; in one of his essays</p>
<p>to denote a certain distinction among the possible subjects of human</p>
<p>speech.  There are some things, he says in effect, about which you</p>
<p>can really talk; and there are other things about which you cannot</p>
<p>properly talk at all, but only dispute, or harangue, or prose, or</p>
<p>moralize, or chatter.</p>
<p>After mature consideration I have arrived at the opinion that this</p>
<p>distinction among the themes of speech is an illusion.  It does not</p>
<p>exist.  All subjects, &quot;the foolish things of the world, and the weak</p>
<p>things of the world, and base things of the world, yea, and things</p>
<p>that are not,&quot; may provide matter for good talk, if only the right</p>
<p>people are engaged in the enterprise.  I know a man who can make a</p>
<p>description of the weather as entertaining as a tune on the violin;</p>
<p>and even on the threadbare theme of the waywardness of domestic</p>
<p>servants, I have heard a discreet woman play the most diverting and</p>
<p>instructive variations.</p>
<p>No, the quality of talkability does not mark a distinction among</p>
<p>things; it denotes a difference among people.  It is not an</p>
<p>attribute unequally distributed among material objects and abstract</p>
<p>ideas.  It is a virtue which belongs to the mind and moral character</p>
<p>of certain persons.  It is a reciprocal human quality; active as</p>
<p>well as passive; a power of bestowing and receiving.</p>
<p>An amiable person is one who has a capacity for loving and being</p>
<p>loved.  An affable person is one who is ready to speak and to be</p>
<p>spoken to,--as, for example, Milton&#x27;s &quot;affable archangel&quot; Raphael;</p>
<p>though it must be confessed that he laid the chief emphasis on the</p>
<p>active side of his affability.  A &quot;clubable&quot; person (to use a word</p>
<p>which Dr. Samuel Johnson invented but did not put into his</p>
<p>dictionary) is one who is fit for the familiar give and take of</p>
<p>club-life.  A talkable person, therefore, is one whose nature and</p>
<p>disposition invite the easy interchange of thoughts and feelings,</p>
<p>one in whose company it is a pleasure to talk or to be talked to.</p>
<p>Now this good quality of talkability is to be distinguished, very</p>
<p>strictly and inflexibly, from the bad quality which imitates it and</p>
<p>often brings it into discredit.  I mean the vice of talkativeness.</p>
<p>That is a selfish, one-sided, inharmonious affair, full of</p>
<p>discomfort, and productive of most unchristian feelings.</p>
<p>You may observe the operations of this vice not only in human</p>
<p>beings, but also in birds.  All the birds in the bush can make some</p>
<p>kind of a noise; and most of them like to do it; and some of them</p>
<p>like it a great deal and do it very much.  But it is not always for</p>
<p>edification, nor are the most vociferous and garrulous birds</p>
<p>commonly the most pleasing.  A parrot, for instance, in your</p>
<p>neighbour&#x27;s back yard, in the summer time, when the windows are</p>
<p>open, is not an aid to the development of Christian character.  I</p>
<p>knew a man who had to stay in the city all summer, and in the autumn</p>
<p>was asked to describe the character and social standing of a new</p>
<p>family that had moved into his neighbourhood.  Were they &quot;nice</p>
<p>people,&quot; well-bred, intelligent, respectable?  &quot;Well,&quot; said he, &quot;I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know what your standards are, and would prefer not to say</p>
<p>anything libellous; but I&#x27;ll tell you in a word,--they are the kind</p>
<p>of people that keep a parrot.&quot;</p>
<p>Then there is the English Sparrow!  What an insufferable chatterbox,</p>
<p>what an incurable scold, what a voluble and tiresome blackguard is</p>
<p>this little feathered cockney.  There is not a sweet or pleasant</p>
<p>word in all his vocabulary.</p>
<p>I am convinced that he talks altogether of scandals and fights and</p>
<p>street-sweepings.</p>
<p>The kingdom of ornithology is divided into two departments,--real</p>
<p>birds and English sparrows.  English sparrows are not real birds;</p>
<p>they are little beasts.</p>
<p>There was a church in Brooklyn which was once covered with a great</p>
<p>and spreading vine, in which the sparrows built innumerable nests.</p>
<p>These ungodly little birds kept up such a din that it was impossible</p>
<p>to hear the service of the sanctuary.  The faithful clergy strained</p>
<p>their voices to the verge of ministerial sore throat, but the people</p>
<p>had no peace in their devotions until the vine was cut down, and the</p>
<p>Anglican intruders were evicted.</p>
<p>A talkative person is like an English sparrow,--a bird that cannot</p>
<p>sing, and will sing, and ought to be persuaded not to try to sing.</p>
<p>But a talkable person has the gift that belongs to the wood thrush</p>
<p>and the veery and the wren, the oriole and the white-throat and the</p>
<p>rose-breasted grosbeak, the mockingbird and the robin (sometimes);</p>
<p>and the brown thrush; yes, the brown thrush has it to perfection, if</p>
<p>you can catch him alone,--the gift of being interesting, charming,</p>
<p>delightful, in the most off-hand and various modes of utterance.</p>
<p>Talkability is not at all the same thing as eloquence.  The eloquent</p>
<p>man surprises, overwhelms, and sometimes paralyzes us by the display</p>
<p>of his power.  Great orators are seldom good talkers.  Oratory in</p>
<p>exercise is masterful and jealous, and intolerant of all</p>
<p>interruptions.  Oratory in preparation is silent, self-centred,</p>
<p>uncommunicative.  The painful truth of this remark may he seen in</p>
<p>the row of countenances along the president&#x27;s table at a public</p>
<p>banquet about nine o&#x27;clock in the evening.  The bicycle-face seems</p>
<p>unconstrained and merry by comparison with the after-dinner-speech-</p>
<p>face.  The flow of table-talk is corked by the anxious conception of</p>
<p>post-prandial oratory.</p>
<p>Thackeray, in one of his ROUNDABOUT PAPERS, speaks of &quot;the sin of</p>
<p>tall-talking,&quot; which, he says, &quot;is the sin of schoolmasters,</p>
<p>governesses, critics, sermoners, and instructors of young or old</p>
<p>people.&quot;  But this is not in accord with my observation.  I should</p>
<p>say it was rather the sin of dilettanti who are ambitious of that</p>
<p>high-stepping accomplishment which is called &quot;conversational</p>
<p>ability.&quot;</p>
<p>This has usually, to my mind, something set and artificial about it,</p>
<p>although in its most perfect form the art almost succeeds in</p>
<p>concealing itself.  But, at all events, &#x27;&#x27;conversation&#x27;&#x27; is talk in</p>
<p>evening dress, with perhaps a little powder and a touch of rouge.</p>
<p>&#x27;T is like one of those wise virgins who are said to look their best</p>
<p>by lamplight.  And doubtless this is an excellent thing, and not</p>
<p>without its advantages.  But for my part, commend me to one who</p>
<p>loses nothing by the early morning illumination,--one who brings all</p>
<p>her attractions with her when she comes down to breakfast,--she is a</p>
<p>very pleasant maid.</p>
<p>Talk is that form of human speech which is exempt from all duties,</p>
<p>foreign and domestic.  It is the nearest thing in the world to</p>
<p>thinking and feeling aloud.  It is necessarily not for publication,--</p>
<p>solely an evidence of good faith and mutual kindness.  You tell me</p>
<p>what you have seen and what you are thinking about, because you take</p>
<p>it for granted that it will interest and entertain me; and you</p>
<p>listen to my replies and the recital of my adventures and opinions,</p>
<p>because you know I like to tell them, and because you find something</p>
<p>in them, of one kind or another, that you care to hear.  It is a</p>
<p>nice game, with easy, simple rules, and endless possibilities of</p>
<p>variation.  And if we go into it with the right spirit, and play it</p>
<p>for love, without heavy stakes, the chances are that if we happen to</p>
<p>be fairly talkable people we shall have one of the best things in</p>
<p>the world,--a mighty good talk.</p>
<p>What is there in this anxious, hide-bound, tiresome existence of</p>
<p>ours, more restful and remunerative?  Montaigne says, &quot;The use of it</p>
<p>is more sweet than of any other action of life; and for that reason</p>
<p>it is that, if I were compelled to choose, I should sooner, I think,</p>
<p>consent to lose my sight than my hearing and speech.&quot;  The very</p>
<p>aimlessness with which it proceeds, the serene disregard of all</p>
<p>considerations of profit and propriety with which it follows its</p>
<p>wandering course, and brings up anywhere or nowhere, to camp for the</p>
<p>night, is one of its attractions.  It is like a day&#x27;s fishing, not</p>
<p>valuable chiefly for the fish you bring home, but for the pleasant</p>
<p>country through which it leads you, and the state of personal well-</p>
<p>being and health in which it leaves you, warmed, and cheered, and</p>
<p>content with life and friendship.</p>
<p>The order in which you set out upon a talk, the path which you</p>
<p>pursue, the rules which you observe or disregard, make but little</p>
<p>difference in the end.  You may follow the advice of Immanuel Kant</p>
<p>if you like, and begin with the weather and the roads, and go on to</p>
<p>current events, and wind up with history, art, and philosophy.  Or</p>
<p>you may reverse the order if you prefer, like that admirable talker</p>
<p>Clarence King, who usually set sail on some highly abstract paradox,</p>
<p>such as &quot;Civilization is a nervous disease,&quot; and landed in a tale of</p>
<p>adventure in Mexico or the Rocky Mountains.  Or you may follow the</p>
<p>example of Edward Eggleston, who started in at the middle and worked</p>
<p>out at either end, and sometimes at both.  It makes no difference.</p>
<p>If the thing is in you at all, you will find good matter for talk</p>
<p>anywhere along the route.  Hear what Montaigne says again: &quot;In our</p>
<p>discourse all subjects are alike to me; let there be neither weight</p>
<p>nor depth, &#x27;t is all one; there is yet grace and pertinence; all</p>
<p>there is tented with a mature and constant judgment, and mixed with</p>
<p>goodness, freedom, gayety, and friendship.&quot;</p>
<p>How close to the mark the old essayist sends his arrow!  He is right</p>
<p>about the essential qualities of good talk.  They are not merely</p>
<p>intellectual.  They are moral.  Goodness of heart, freedom of</p>
<p>spirit, gayety of temper, and friendliness of disposition,--these</p>
<p>are four fine things, and doubtless as acceptable to God as they are</p>
<p>agreeable to men.  The talkability which springs out of these</p>
<p>qualities has its roots in a good soil.  On such a plant one need</p>
<p>not look for the poison berries of malign discourse, nor for the</p>
<p>Dead Sea apples of frivolous mockery.  But fair fruit will be there,</p>
<p>pleasant to the sight and good for food, brought forth abundantly</p>
<p>according to the season.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>VARIATIONS--ON A PLEASANT PHRASE FROM MONTAIGNE</p>
<p>Montaigne has given as our text, &quot;Goodness, freedom, gayety, and</p>
<p>friendship,&quot;--these are the conditions which produce talkability.</p>
<p>And on this fourfold theme we may embroider a few variations, by way</p>
<p>of exposition and enlargement.</p>
<p>GOODNESS is the first thing and the most needful.  An ugly, envious,</p>
<p>irritable disposition is not fitted for talk.  The occasions for</p>
<p>offence are too numerous, and the way into strife is too short and</p>
<p>easy.  A touch of good-natured combativeness, a fondness for brisk</p>
<p>argument, a readiness to try a friendly bout with any comer, on any</p>
<p>ground, is a decided advantage in a talker.  It breaks up the</p>
<p>offensive monotony of polite concurrence, and makes things lively.</p>
<p>But quarrelsomeness is quite another affair, and very fatal.</p>
<p>I am always a little uneasy in a discourse with the Reverend</p>
<p>Bellicosus Macduff.  It is like playing golf on links liable to</p>
<p>earthquakes.  One never knows when the landscape will be thrown into</p>
<p>convulsions.  Macduff has a tendency to regard a difference of</p>
<p>opinion as a personal insult.  If he makes a bad stroke he seems to</p>
<p>think that the way to retrieve it is to deliver the next one on the</p>
<p>head of the other player.  He does not tarry for the invitation to</p>
<p>lay on; and before you know what has happened you find yourself in a</p>
<p>position where you are obliged to cry, &quot;Hold, enough!&quot; and to be</p>
<p>liberally damned without any bargain to that effect.  This is</p>
<p>discouraging, and calculated to make one wish that human intercourse</p>
<p>might be put, as far as Macduff is concerned, upon the gold basis of</p>
<p>silence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what a delight it was to talk with that old</p>
<p>worthy, Chancellor Howard Crosby.  He was a fighting man for four or</p>
<p>five generations hack, Dutch on one side, English on the other.  But</p>
<p>there was not one little drop of gall in his blood.  His opinions</p>
<p>were fixed to a degree; he loved to do battle for them; he never</p>
<p>changed them--at least never in the course of the same discussion.</p>
<p>He admired and respected a gallant adversary, and urged him on, with</p>
<p>quips and puns and daring assaults and unqualified statements, to do</p>
<p>his best.  Easy victories were not to his taste.  Even if he joined</p>
<p>with you in laying out some common falsehood for burial, you might</p>
<p>be sure that before the affair was concluded there would be every</p>
<p>prospect of what an Irishman would call &quot;an elegant wake.&quot;  If you</p>
<p>stood up against him on one of his favorite subjects of discussion</p>
<p>you must be prepared for hot work.  You would have to take off your</p>
<p>coat.  But when the combat was over he would be the man to help you</p>
<p>on with it again; and you would walk home together arm in arm,</p>
<p>through the twilight, smoking the pipe of peace.  Talk like that</p>
<p>does good.  It quickens the beating of the heart, and leaves no</p>
<p>scars upon it.</p>
<p>But this manly spirit, which loves</p>

<p>is a very different thing from that mean, bad, hostile temper which</p>
<p>loves to inflict wounds and injuries just for the sake of showing</p>
<p>power, and which is never so happy as when it is making some one</p>
<p>wince.  There are such people in the world, and sometimes their</p>
<p>brilliancy tempts us to forget their malignancy.  But to have much</p>
<p>converse with them is as if we should make playmates of rattlesnakes</p>
<p>for their grace of movement and swiftness of stroke.</p>
<p>I knew a man once (I will not name him even with an initial) who was</p>
<p>malignant to the core.  Learned, industrious, accomplished, he kept</p>
<p>all his talents at the service of a perfect genius for hatred.  If</p>
<p>you crossed his path but once, he would never cease to curse you.</p>
<p>The grave might close over you, but he would revile your epitaph and</p>
<p>mock at your memory.  It was not even necessary that you should do</p>
<p>anything to incur his enmity.  It was enough to be upright and</p>
<p>sincere and successful, to waken the wrath of this Shimei.</p>
<p>Integrity was an offence to him, and excellence of any kind filled</p>
<p>him with spleen.  There was no good cause within his horizon that he</p>
<p>did not give a bad word to, and no decent man in the community whom</p>
<p>he did not try either to use or to abuse.  To listen to him or to</p>
<p>read what he had written was to learn to think a little worse of</p>
<p>every one that he mentioned, and worst of all of him.  He had the</p>
<p>air of a gentleman, the vocabulary of a scholar, the style of a</p>
<p>Junius, and the heart of a Thersites.</p>
<p>Talk, in such company, is impossible.  The sense of something evil,</p>
<p>lurking beneath the play of wit, is like the knowledge that there</p>
<p>are snakes in the grass.  Every step must be taken with fear.  But</p>
<p>the real pleasure of a walk through the meadow comes from the</p>
<p>feeling of security, of ease, of safe and happy abandon to the mood</p>
<p>of the moment.  This ungirdled and unguarded felicity in mutual</p>
<p>discourse depends, after all, upon the assurance of real goodness in</p>
<p>your companion.  I do not mean a stiff impeccability of conduct.</p>
<p>Prudes and Pharisees are poor comrades.  I mean simply goodness of</p>
<p>heart, the wholesome, generous, kindly quality which thinketh no</p>
<p>evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, hopeth all things, endureth all</p>
<p>things, and wisheth well to all men.  Where you feel this quality</p>
<p>you can let yourself go, in the ease of hearty talk.</p>
<p>FREEDOM is the second note that Montaigne strikes, and it is</p>
<p>essential to the harmony of talking.  Very careful, prudent, precise</p>
<p>persons are seldom entertaining in familiar speech.  They are like</p>
<p>tennis players in too fine clothes.  They think more of their</p>
<p>costume than of the game.</p>
<p>A mania for absolutely correct pronunciation is fatal.  The people</p>
<p>who are afflicted with this painful ailment are as anxious about</p>
<p>their utterance as dyspeptics about their diet.  They move through</p>
<p>their sentences as delicately as Agag walked.  Their little airs of</p>
<p>nicety, their starched cadences and frilled phrases seem as if they</p>
<p>had just been taken out of a literary bandbox.  If perchance you</p>
<p>happen to misplace an accent, you shall see their eyebrows curl up</p>
<p>like an interrogation mark, and they will ask you what authority you</p>
<p>have for that pronunciation.  As if, forsooth, a man could not talk</p>
<p>without book-license!  As if he must have a permit from some dusty</p>
<p>lexicon before he can take a good word into his mouth and speak it</p>
<p>out like the people with whom he has lived!</p>
<p>The truth is that the man who is very particular not to commit</p>
<p>himself, in pronunciation or otherwise, and talks as if his remarks</p>
<p>were being taken down in shorthand, and shudders at the thought of</p>
<p>making a mistake, will hardly be able to open your heart or let out</p>
<p>the best that is in his own.</p>
<p>Reserve and precision are a great protection to overrated</p>
<p>reputations; but they are death to talk.</p>
<p>In talk it is not correctness of grammar nor elegance of enunciation</p>
<p>that charms us; it is spirit, VERVE, the sudden turn of humour, the</p>
<p>keen, pungent taste of life.  For this reason a touch of dialect, a</p>
<p>flavour of brogue, is delightful.  Any dialect is classic that has</p>
<p>conveyed beautiful thoughts.  Who that ever talked with the poet</p>
<p>Tennyson, when he let himself go, over the pipes, would miss the</p>
<p>savour of his broad-rolling Lincolnshire vowels, now heightening the</p>
<p>humour, now deepening the pathos, of his genuine manly speech?</p>
<p>There are many good stories lingering in the memories of those who</p>
<p>knew Dr. James McCosh, the late president of Princeton University,--</p>
<p>stories too good, I fear, to get into a biography; but the best of</p>
<p>them, in print, would not have the snap and vigour of the poorest of</p>
<p>them, in talk, with his own inimitable Scotch-Irish brogue to set it</p>
<p>forth.</p>
<p>A brogue is not a fault.  It is a beauty, an heirloom, a</p>
<p>distinction.  A local accent is like a landed inheritance; it marks</p>
<p>a man&#x27;s place in the world, tells where he comes from.  Of course it</p>
<p>is possible to have too much of it.  A man does not need to carry</p>
<p>the soil of his whole farm around with him on his boots.  But,</p>
<p>within limits, the accent of a native region is delightful.  &#x27;T is</p>
<p>the flavour of heather in the grouse, the taste of wild herbs and</p>
<p>evergreen-buds in the venison.  I like the maple-sugar tang of the</p>
<p>Vermonter&#x27;s sharp-edged speech; the round, full-waisted r&#x27;s of</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and Ohio; the soft, indolent vowels of the South.  One</p>
<p>of the best talkers now living is a schoolmaster from Virginia,</p>
<p>Colonel Gordon McCabe.  I once crossed the ocean with him on a</p>
<p>stream of stories that reached from Liverpool to New York.  He did</p>
<p>not talk in the least like a book.  He talked like a Virginian.</p>
<p>When Montaigne mentions GAYETY as the third clement of satisfying</p>
<p>discourse, I fancy he does not mean mere fun, though that has its</p>
<p>value at the right time and place.  But there is another quality</p>
<p>which is far more valuable and always fit.  Indeed it underlies the</p>
<p>best fun and makes it wholesome.  It is cheerfulness, the temper</p>
<p>which makes the best of things and squeezes the little drops of</p>
<p>honey even out of thistle-blossoms.  I think this is what Montaigne</p>
<p>meant.  Certainly it is what he had.</p>
<p>Cheerfulness is the background of all good talk.  A sense of humour</p>
<p>is a means of grace.  With it I have heard a pleasant soul make even</p>
<p>that most perilous of all subjects, the description of a long</p>
<p>illness, entertaining.  The various physicians moved through the</p>
<p>recital as excellent comedians, and the medicines appeared like a</p>
<p>succession of timely jests.</p>
<p>There is no occasion upon which this precious element of talkability</p>
<p>comes out stronger than when we are on a journey.  Travel with a</p>
<p>cheerless and easily discouraged companion is an unadulterated</p>
<p>misery.  But a cheerful comrade is better than a waterproof coat and</p>
<p>a foot-warmer.</p>
<p>I remember riding once with my lady Graygown fifteen miles through a</p>
<p>cold rainstorm, in an open buckboard, over the worst road in the</p>
<p>world, from LAC A LA BELLE RIVIERE to the Metabetchouan River.  Such</p>
<p>was the cheerfulness of her ejaculations (the only possible form of</p>
<p>talk) that we arrived at our destination as warm and merry as if we</p>
<p>had been sitting beside a roaring camp-fire.</p>
<p>But after all, the very best thing in good talk, and the thing that</p>
<p>helps it most, is FRIENDSHIP.  How it dissolves the barriers that</p>
<p>divide us, and loosens all constraint, and diffuses itself like some</p>
<p>fine old cordial through all the veins of life--this feeling that we</p>
<p>understand and trust each other, and wish each other heartily well!</p>
<p>Everything into which it really comes is good.  It transforms</p>
<p>letter-writing from a task into a pleasure.  It makes music a</p>
<p>thousand times more sweet.  The people who play and sing not at us,</p>
<p>but TO us,--how delightful it is to listen to them!  Yes, there is a</p>
<p>talkability that can express itself even without words.  There is an</p>
<p>exchange of thought and feeling which is happy alike in speech and</p>
<p>in silence.  It is quietness pervaded with friendship.</p>
<p>Having come thus far in the exposition of Montaigne, I shall</p>
<p>conclude with an opinion of my own, even though I cannot quote a</p>
<p>sentence of his to back it.</p>
<p>The one person of all the world in whom talkability is most</p>
<p>desirable, and talkativeness least endurable, is a wife.</p>
<p>A WILD STRAWBERRY</p>
<p>&quot;Such is the story of the Boblink; once spiritual, musical, admired,</p>
<p>the joy of the meadows, and the favourite bird of spring; finally a</p>
<p>gross little sensualist who expiates his sensuality in the larder.</p>
<p>His story contains a moral, worthy the attention of all little birds</p>
<p>and little boys; warning them to keep to those refined and</p>
<p>intellectual pursuits which raised him to so high a pitch of</p>
<p>popularity during the early part of his career; but to eschew all</p>
<p>tendency to that gross and dissipated indulgence, which brought this</p>
<p>mistaken little bird to an untimely end.&quot;--WASHINGTON IRVING:</p>
<p>Wolfert&#x27;s Roost.</p>
<p>The Swiftwater brook was laughing softly to itself as it ran through</p>
<p>a strip of hemlock forest on the edge of the Woodlings&#x27; farm.  Among</p>
<p>the evergreen branches overhead the gayly-dressed warblers,--little</p>
<p>friends of the forest,--were flitting to and fro, lisping their June</p>
<p>songs of contented love: milder, slower, lazier notes than those in</p>
<p>which they voiced the amourous raptures of May.  Prince&#x27;s Pine and</p>
<p>golden loose-strife and pink laurel and blue hare-bells and purple-</p>
<p>fringed orchids, and a score of lovely flowers were all abloom.  The</p>
<p>late spring had hindered some; the sudden heats of early summer had</p>
<p>hastened others; and now they seemed to come out all together, as if</p>
<p>Nature had suddenly tilted up her cornucopia and poured forth her</p>
<p>treasures in spendthrift joy.</p>
<p>I lay on a mossy bank at the foot of a tree, filling my pipe after a</p>
<p>frugal lunch, and thinking how hard it would be to find in any</p>
<p>quarter of the globe a place more fair and fragrant than this hidden</p>
<p>vale among the Alleghany Mountains.  The perfume of the flowers of</p>
<p>the forest is more sweet and subtle than the heavy scent of tropical</p>
<p>blossoms.  No lily-field in Bermuda could give a fragrance half so</p>
<p>magical as the fairy-like odour of these woodland slopes, soft</p>
<p>carpeted with the green of glossy vines above whose tiny leaves, in</p>
<p>delicate profusion,</p>

<p>Nor are there any birds in Africa, or among the Indian Isles, more</p>
<p>exquisite in colour than these miniature warblers, showing their</p>
<p>gold and green, their orange and black, their blue and white,</p>
<p>against the dark background of the rhododendron thicket.</p>
<p>But how seldom we put a cup of pleasure to our lips without a dash</p>
<p>of bitters, a touch of faultfinding.  My drop of discontent, that</p>
<p>day, was the thought that the northern woodland, at least in June,</p>
<p>yielded no fruit to match its beauty and its fragrance.</p>
<p>There is good browsing among the leaves of the wood and the grasses</p>
<p>of the meadow, as every well-instructed angler knows.  The bright</p>
<p>emerald tips that break from the hemlock and the balsam like verdant</p>
<p>flames have a pleasant savour to the tongue.  The leaves of the</p>
<p>sassafras are full of spice, and the bark of the black-birch twigs</p>
<p>holds a fine cordial.  Crinkle-root is spicy, but you must partake</p>
<p>of it delicately, or it will bite your tongue.  Spearmint and</p>
<p>peppermint never lose their charm for the palate that still</p>
<p>remembers the delights of youth.  Wild sorrel has an agreeable,</p>
<p>sour, shivery flavour.  Even the tender stalk of a young blade of</p>
<p>grass is a thing that can be chewed by a person of childlike mind</p>
<p>with much contentment.</p>
<p>But, after all, these are only relishes.  They whet the appetite</p>
<p>more than they appease it.  There should be something to eat, in the</p>
<p>June woods, as perfect in its kind, as satisfying to the sense of</p>
<p>taste, as the birds and the flowers are to the senses of sight and</p>
<p>hearing and smell.  Blueberries are good, but they are far away in</p>
<p>July.  Blackberries are luscious when they are fully ripe, but that</p>
<p>will not be until August.  Then the fishing will be over, and the</p>
<p>angler&#x27;s hour of need will be past.  The one thing that is lacking</p>
<p>now beside this mountain stream is some fruit more luscious and</p>
<p>dainty than grows in the tropics, to melt upon the lips and fill the</p>
<p>mouth with pleasure.</p>
<p>But that is what these cold northern woods will not offer.  They are</p>
<p>too reserved, too lofty, too puritanical to make provision for the</p>
<p>grosser wants of humanity.  They are not friendly to luxury.</p>
<p>Just then, as I shifted my head to find a softer pillow of moss</p>
<p>after this philosophic and immoral reflection, Nature gave me her</p>
<p>silent answer.  Three wild strawberries, nodding on their long</p>
<p>stems, hung over my face.  It was an invitation to taste and see</p>
<p>that they were good.</p>
<p>The berries were not the round and rosy ones of the meadow, but the</p>
<p>long, slender, dark crimson ones of the forest.  One, two, three; no</p>
<p>more on that vine; but each one as it touched my lips was a drop of</p>
<p>nectar and a crumb of ambrosia, a concentrated essence of all the</p>
<p>pungent sweetness of the wildwood, sapid, penetrating, and</p>
<p>delicious.  I tasted the odour of a hundred blossoms and the green</p>
<p>shimmering of innumerable leaves and the sparkle of sifted sunbeams</p>
<p>and the breath of highland breezes and the song of many birds and</p>
<p>the murmur of flowing streams,--all in a wild strawberry.</p>
<p>Do you remember, in THE COMPLEAT ANGLER, a remark which Isaak Walton</p>
<p>quotes from a certain &quot;Doctor Boteler&quot; about strawberries?</p>
<p>&quot;Doubtless,&quot; said that wise old man, &quot;God could have made a better</p>
<p>berry, but doubtless God never did.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, the wild strawberry is the one that God made.</p>
<p>I think it would have been pleasant to know a man who could sum up</p>
<p>his reflections upon the important question of berries in such a</p>
<p>pithy saying as that which Walton repeats.  His tongue must have</p>
<p>been in close communication with his heart.  He must have had a fair</p>
<p>sense of that sprightly humour without which piety itself is often</p>
<p>insipid.</p>
<p>I have often tried to find out more about him, and some day I hope I</p>
<p>shall.  But up to the present, all that the books have told me of</p>
<p>this obscure sage is that his name was William Butler, and that he</p>
<p>was an eminent physician, sometimes called &quot;the Aesculapius of his</p>
<p>age.&quot;  He was born at Ipswich, in l535, and educated at Clare Hall,</p>
<p>Cambridge; in the neighbourhood of which town he appears to have</p>
<p>spent the most of his life, in high repute as a practitioner of</p>
<p>physic.  He had the honour of doctoring King James the First after</p>
<p>an accident on the hunting field, and must have proved himself a</p>
<p>pleasant old fellow, for the king looked him up at Cambridge the</p>
<p>next year, and spent an hour in his lodgings.  This wise physician</p>
<p>also invented a medicinal beverage called &quot;Doctor Butler&#x27;s Ale.&quot;  I</p>
<p>do not quite like the sound of it, but perhaps it was better than</p>
<p>its name.  This much is sure, at all events: either it was really a</p>
<p>harmless drink, or else the doctor must have confined its use</p>
<p>entirely to his patients; for he lived to the ripe age of eighty-</p>
<p>three years.</p>
<p>Between the time when William Butler first needed the services of a</p>
<p>physician, in 1535, and the time when he last prescribed for a</p>
<p>patient, in 1618, there was plenty of trouble in England.  Bloody</p>
<p>Queen Mary sat on the throne; and there were all kinds of quarrels</p>
<p>about religion and politics; and Catholics and Protestants were</p>
<p>killing one another in the name of God.  After that the red-haired</p>
<p>Elizabeth, called the Virgin Queen, wore the crown, and waged</p>
<p>triumphant war and tempestuous love.  Then fat James of Scotland was</p>
<p>made king of Great Britain; and Guy Fawkes tried to blow him up with</p>
<p>gunpowder, and failed; and the king tried to blow out all the pipes</p>
<p>in England with his COUNTERBLAST AGAINST TOBACCO; but he failed too.</p>
<p>Somewhere about that time, early in the seventeenth century, a very</p>
<p>small event happened.  A new berry was brought over from Virginia,--</p>
<p>FRAGRARIA VIRGINIANA,--and then, amid wars and rumours of wars,</p>
<p>Doctor Butler&#x27;s happiness was secure.  That new berry was so much</p>
<p>richer and sweeter and more generous than the familiar FRAGRARIA</p>
<p>VESCA of Europe, that it attracted the sincere interest of all</p>
<p>persons of good taste.  It inaugurated a new era in the history of</p>
<p>the strawberry.  The long lost masterpiece of Paradise was restored</p>
<p>to its true place in the affections of man.</p>
<p>Is there not a touch of merry contempt for all the vain</p>
<p>controversies and conflicts of humanity in the grateful ejaculation</p>
<p>with which the old doctor greeted that peaceful, comforting gift of</p>
<p>Providence?</p>
<p>&quot;From this time forward,&quot; he seems to say, &quot;the fates cannot beggar</p>
<p>me, for I have eaten strawberries.  With every Maytime that visits</p>
<p>this distracted island, the white blossoms with hearts of gold will</p>
<p>arrive.  In every June the red drops of pleasant savour will hang</p>
<p>among the scalloped leaves.  The children of this world may wrangle</p>
<p>and give one another wounds that even my good ale cannot cure.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the earth as God created it is a fair dwelling and</p>
<p>full of comfort for all who have a quiet mind and a thankful heart.</p>
<p>Doubtless God might have made a better world, but doubtless this is</p>
<p>the world He made for us; and in it He planted the strawberry.&quot;</p>
<p>Fine old doctor!  Brave philosopher of cheerfulness!  The Virginian</p>
<p>berry should have been brought to England sooner, or you should have</p>
<p>lived longer, at least to a hundred years, so that you might have</p>
<p>welcomed a score of strawberry-seasons with gratitude and an</p>
<p>epigram.</p>
<p>Since that time a great change has passed over the fruit which</p>
<p>Doctor Butler praised so well.  That product of creative art which</p>
<p>Divine wisdom did not choose to surpass, human industry has laboured</p>
<p>to improve.  It has grown immensely in size and substance.  The</p>
<p>traveller from America who steams into Queenstown harbour in early</p>
<p>summer is presented (for a consideration) with a cabbage-leaf full</p>
<p>of pale-hued berries, sweet and juicy, any one of which would</p>
<p>outbulk a dozen of those that used to grow in Virginia when</p>
<p>Pocahontas was smitten with the charms of Captain John Smith.  They</p>
<p>are superb, those light-tinted Irish strawberries.  And there are</p>
<p>wonderful new varieties developed in the gardens of New Jersey and</p>
<p>Rhode Island, which compare with the ancient berries of the woods</p>
<p>and meadows as Leviathan with a minnow.  The huge crimson cushions</p>
<p>hang among the plants so thick that they seem like bunches of fruit</p>
<p>with a few leaves attached for ornament.  You can satisfy your</p>
<p>hunger in such a berry-patch in ten minutes, while out in the field</p>
<p>you must pick for half an hour, and in the forest thrice as long,</p>
<p>before you can fill a small tin cup.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, it is questionable whether men have really bettered</p>
<p>God&#x27;s CHEF D&#x27;OEUVRE in the berry line.  They have enlarged it and</p>
<p>made it more plentiful and more certain in its harvest.  But</p>
<p>sweeter, more fragrant, more poignant in its flavour?  No.  The wild</p>
<p>berry still stands first in its subtle gusto.</p>
<p>Size is not the measure of excellence.  Perfection lies in quality,</p>
<p>not in quantity.  Concentration enhances pleasure, gives it a point</p>
<p>so that it goes deeper.</p>
<p>Is not a ten-inch trout better than a ten-foot sturgeon?  I would</p>
<p>rather read a tiny essay by Charles Lamb than a five-hundred page</p>
<p>libel on life by a modern British novelist who shall be nameless.</p>
<p>Flavour is the priceless quality.  Style is the thing that counts</p>
<p>and is remembered, in literature, in art, and in berries.</p>
<p>No JOCUNDA, nor TRIUMPH, nor VICTORIA, nor any other high-titled</p>
<p>fruit that ever took the first prize at an agricultural fair, is</p>
<p>half so delicate and satisfying as the wild strawberry that dropped</p>
<p>into my mouth, under the hemlock tree, beside the Swiftwater.</p>
<p>A touch of surprise is essential to perfect sweetness.</p>
<p>To get what you have been wishing for is pleasant; but to get what</p>
<p>you have not been sure of, makes the pleasure tingle.  A new door of</p>
<p>happiness is opened when you go out to hunt for something and</p>
<p>discover it with your own eyes.  But there is an experience even</p>
<p>better than that.  When you have stupidly forgotten (or despondently</p>
<p>forgone) to look about you for the unclaimed treasures and unearned</p>
<p>blessings which are scattered along the by-ways of life, then,</p>
<p>sometimes by a special mercy, a small sample of them is quietly laid</p>
<p>before you so that you cannot help seeing it, and it brings you back</p>
<p>to a sense of the joyful possibilities of living.</p>
<p>How full of enjoyment is the search after wild things,--wild birds,</p>
<p>wild flowers, wild honey, wild berries!  There was a country club on</p>
<p>Storm King Mountain, above the Hudson River, where they used to</p>
<p>celebrate a festival of flowers every spring.  Men and women who had</p>
<p>conservatories of their own, full of rare plants and costly orchids,</p>
<p>came together to admire the gathered blossoms of the woodlands and</p>
<p>meadows.  But the people who had the best of the entertainment were</p>
<p>the boys and girls who wandered through the thickets and down the</p>
<p>brooks, pushed their way into the tangled copses and crept</p>
<p>venturesomely across the swamps, to look for the flowers.  Some of</p>
<p>the seekers may have had a few gray hairs; but for that day at least</p>
<p>they were all boys and girls.  Nature was as young as ever, and they</p>
<p>were all her children.  Hand touched hand without a glove.  The</p>
<p>hidden blossoms of friendship unfolded.  Laughter and merry shouts</p>
<p>and snatches of half-forgotten song rose to the lips.  Gay adventure</p>
<p>sparkled in the air.  School was out and nobody listened for the</p>
<p>bell.  It was just a day to live, and be natural, and take no</p>
<p>thought for the morrow.</p>
<p>There is great luck in this affair of looking for flowers.  I do not</p>
<p>see how any one who is prejudiced against games of chance can</p>
<p>consistently undertake it.</p>
<p>For my own part, I approve of garden flowers because they are so</p>
<p>orderly and so certain; but wild flowers I love, just because there</p>
<p>is so much chance about them.  Nature is all in favour of certainty</p>
<p>in great laws and of uncertainty in small events.  You cannot</p>
<p>appoint the day and the place for her flower-shows.  If you happen</p>
<p>to drop in at the right moment she will give you a free admission.</p>
<p>But even then it seems as if the table of beauty had been spread for</p>
<p>the joy of a higher visitor, and in obedience to secret orders which</p>
<p>you have not heard.</p>
<p>Have you ever found the fringed gentian?</p>

<p>There are strange freaks of fortune in the finding of wild flowers,</p>
<p>and curious coincidences which make us feel as if some one were</p>
<p>playing friendly tricks on us.  I remember reading, one evening in</p>
<p>May, a passage in a good book called THE PROCESSION OF THE FLOWERS,</p>
<p>in which Colonel Higginson describes the singular luck that a friend</p>
<p>of his enjoyed, year after year, in finding the rare blossoms of the</p>
<p>double rueanemone.  It seems that this man needed only to take a</p>
<p>walk in the suburbs of any town, and he would come upon a bed of</p>
<p>these flowers, without effort or design.  I envied him his good</p>
<p>fortune, for I had never discovered even one of them.  But the next</p>
<p>morning, as I strolled out to fish the Swiftwater, down below Billy</p>
<p>Lerns&#x27;s spring-house I found a green bank in the shadow of the wood</p>
<p>all bespangled with tiny, trembling, twofold stars,--double</p>
<p>rueanemones, for luck!  It was a favourable omen, and that day I</p>
<p>came home with a creel full of trout.</p>
<p>The theory that Adam lived out in the woods for some time before he</p>
<p>was put into the garden of Eden &quot;to dress it and to keep it&quot; has an</p>
<p>air of probability.  How else shall we account for the arboreal</p>
<p>instincts that cling to his posterity?</p>
<p>There is a wilding strain in our blood that all the civilization in</p>
<p>the world will not eradicate.  I never knew a real boy--or, for that</p>
<p>matter, a girl worth knowing--who would not rather climb a tree, any</p>
<p>day, than walk up a golden stairway.</p>
<p>It is a touch of this instinct, I suppose, that makes it more</p>
<p>delightful to fish in the most insignificant of free streams than in</p>
<p>a carefully stocked and preserved pond, where the fish are brought</p>
<p>up by hand and fed on minced liver.  Such elaborate precautions to</p>
<p>ensure good luck extract all the spice from the sport of angling.</p>
<p>Casting the fly in such a pond, if you hooked a fish, you might</p>
<p>expect to hear the keeper say, &quot;Ah, that is Charles, we will play</p>
<p>him and put him back, if you please, sir; for the master is very</p>
<p>fond of him,&quot;--or, &quot;Now you have got hold of Edward; let us land him</p>
<p>and keep him; he is three years old this month, and just ready to be</p>
<p>eaten.&quot;  It would seem like taking trout out of cold storage.</p>
<p>Who could find any pleasure in angling for the tame carp in the</p>
<p>fish-pool of Fontainebleau?  They gather at the marble steps, those</p>
<p>venerable, courtly fish, to receive their rations; and there are</p>
<p>veterans among them, in ancient livery, with fringes of green moss</p>
<p>on their shoulders, who could tell you pretty tales of being fed by</p>
<p>the white hands of maids of honour, or even of nibbling their crumbs</p>
<p>of bread from the jewelled fingers of a princess.</p>
<p>There is no sport in bringing pets to the table.  It may be</p>
<p>necessary sometimes; but the true sportsman would always prefer to</p>
<p>leave the unpleasant task of execution to menial hands, while he</p>
<p>goes out into the wild country to capture his game by his own</p>
<p>skill,--if he has good luck.  I would rather run some risk in this</p>
<p>enterprise (even as the young Tobias did, when the voracious pike</p>
<p>sprang at him from the waters of the Tigris, and would have devoured</p>
<p>him but for the friendly instruction of the piscatory Angel, who</p>
<p>taught Tobias how to land the monster),--I would far rather take any</p>
<p>number of chances in my sport than have it domesticated to the point</p>
<p>of dulness.</p>
<p>The trim plantations of trees which are called &quot;forests&quot; in certain</p>
<p>parts of Europe--scientifically pruned and tended, counted every</p>
<p>year by uniformed foresters, and defended against all possible</p>
<p>depredations--are admirable and useful in their way; but they lack</p>
<p>the mystic enchantment of the fragments of native woodland which</p>
<p>linger among the Adirondacks and the White Mountains, or the vast,</p>
<p>shaggy, sylvan wildernesses which hide the lakes and rivers of</p>
<p>Canada.  These Laurentian Hills lie in No Man&#x27;s Land.  Here you do</p>
<p>not need to keep to the path, for there is none.  You may make your</p>
<p>own trail, whithersoever fancy leads you; and at night you may pitch</p>
<p>your tent under any tree that looks friendly and firm.</p>
<p>Here, if anywhere, you shall find Dryads, and Naiads, and Oreads.</p>
<p>And if you chance to see one, by moonlight, combing her long hair</p>
<p>beside the glimmering waterfall, or slipping silently, with gleaming</p>
<p>shoulders, through the grove of silver birches, you may call her by</p>
<p>the name that pleases you best.  She is all your own discovery.</p>
<p>There is no social directory in the wilderness.</p>
<p>One side of our nature, no doubt, finds its satisfaction in the</p>
<p>regular, the proper, the conventional.  But there is another side of</p>
<p>our nature, underneath, that takes delight in the strange, the free,</p>
<p>the spontaneous.  We like to discover what we call a law of Nature,</p>
<p>and make our calculations about it, and harness the force which lies</p>
<p>behind it for our own purposes.  But we taste a different kind of</p>
<p>joy when an event occurs which nobody has foreseen or counted upon.</p>
<p>It seems like an evidence that there is something in the world which</p>
<p>is alive and mysterious and untrammelled.</p>
<p>The weather-prophet tells us of an approaching storm.  It comes</p>
<p>according to the programme.  We admire the accuracy of the</p>
<p>prediction, and congratulate ourselves that we have such a good</p>
<p>meteorological service.  But when, perchance, a bright, crystalline</p>
<p>piece of weather arrives instead of the foretold tempest, do we not</p>
<p>feel a secret sense of pleasure which goes beyond our mere comfort</p>
<p>in the sunshine?  The whole affair is not as easy as a sum in simple</p>
<p>addition, after all,--at least not with our present knowledge.  It</p>
<p>is a good joke on the Weather Bureau.  &quot;Aha, Old Probabilities!&quot; we</p>
<p>say, &quot;you don&#x27;t know it all yet; there are still some chances to be</p>
<p>taken!&quot;</p>
<p>Some day, I suppose, all things in the heavens above, and in the</p>
<p>earth beneath, and in the hearts of the men and women who dwell</p>
<p>between, will be investigated and explained.  We shall live a</p>
<p>perfectly ordered life, with no accidents, happy or unhappy.</p>
<p>Everybody will act according to rule, and there will be no dotted</p>
<p>lines on the map of human existence, no regions marked &quot;unexplored.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps that golden age of the machine will come, but you and I will</p>
<p>hardly live to see it.  And if that seems to you a matter for tears,</p>
<p>you must do your own weeping, for I cannot find it in my heart to</p>
<p>add a single drop of regret.</p>
<p>The results of education and social discipline in humanity are fine.</p>
<p>It is a good thing that we can count upon them.  But at the same</p>
<p>time let us rejoice in the play of native traits and individual</p>
<p>vagaries.  Cultivated manners are admirable, yet there is a sudden</p>
<p>touch of inborn grace and courtesy that goes beyond them all.  No</p>
<p>array of accomplishments can rival the charm of an unsuspected gift</p>
<p>of nature, brought suddenly to light.  I once heard a peasant girl</p>
<p>singing down the Traunthal, and the echo of her song outlives, in</p>
<p>the hearing of my heart, all memories of the grand opera.</p>
<p>The harvest of the gardens and the orchards, the result of prudent</p>
<p>planting and patient cultivation, is full of satisfaction.  We</p>
<p>anticipate it in due season, and when it comes we fill our mouths</p>
<p>and are grateful.  But pray, kind Providence, let me slip over the</p>
<p>fence out of the garden now and then, to shake a nut-tree that grows</p>
<p>untended in the wood.  Give me liberty to put off my black coat for</p>
<p>a day, and go a-fishing on a free stream, and find by chance a wild</p>
<p>strawberry.</p>
<p>LOVERS AND LANDSCAPE</p>
<p>&quot;He insisted that the love that was of real value in the world was</p>
<p>n&#x27;t interesting, and that the love that was interesting was n&#x27;t</p>
<p>always admirable.  Love that happened to a person like the measles</p>
<p>or fits, and was really of no particular credit to itself or its</p>
<p>victims, was the sort that got into the books and was made much of;</p>
<p>whereas the kind that was attained by the endeavour of true souls,</p>
<p>and that had wear in it, and that made things go right instead of</p>
<p>tangling them up, was too much like duty to make satisfactory</p>
<p>reading for people of sentiment.&quot;--E. S. MARTIN: My Cousin Anthony.</p>
<p>The first day of spring is one thing, and the first spring day is</p>
<p>another.  The difference between them is sometimes as great as a</p>
<p>month.</p>
<p>The first day of spring is due to arrive, if the calendar does not</p>
<p>break down, about the twenty-first of March, when the earth turns</p>
<p>the corner of Sun Alley and starts for Summer Street.  But the first</p>
<p>spring day is not on the time-table at all.  It comes when it is</p>
<p>ready, and in the latitude of New York this is usually not till</p>
<p>after All Fools&#x27; Day.</p>
<p>About this time,--</p>

<p>it is the habit of the angler who lives in town to prepare for the</p>
<p>labours of the approaching season by longer walks or bicycle-rides</p>
<p>in the parks, or along the riverside, or in the somewhat demoralized</p>
<p>Edens of the suburbs.  In the course of these vernal peregrinations</p>
<p>and circumrotations, I observe that lovers of various kinds begin to</p>
<p>occupy a notable place in the landscape.</p>
<p>The burnished dove puts a livelier iris around his neck, and</p>
<p>practises fantastic bows and amourous quicksteps along the verandah</p>
<p>of the pigeon-house and on every convenient roof.  The young male of</p>
<p>the human species, less gifted in the matter of rainbows, does his</p>
<p>best with a gay cravat, and turns the thoughts which circulate above</p>
<p>it towards the securing or propitiating of a best girl.</p>
<p>The objects of these more or less brilliant attentions, doves and</p>
<p>girls, show a becoming reciprocity, and act in a way which leads us</p>
<p>to infer (so far as inferences hold good in the mysterious region of</p>
<p>female conduct) that they are not seriously displeased.  To a</p>
<p>rightly tempered mind, pleasure is a pleasant sight.  And the</p>
<p>philosophic observer who could look upon this spring spectacle of</p>
<p>the lovers with any but friendly feelings would be indeed what the</p>
<p>great Dr. Samuel Johnson called &quot;a person not to be envied.&quot;</p>
<p>Far be it from me to fall into such a desiccated and supercilious</p>
<p>mood.  My small olive-branch of fancy will be withered, in truth,</p>
<p>and ready to drop budless from the tree, when I cease to feel a mild</p>
<p>delight in the billings and cooings of the little birds that</p>
<p>separate from the flocks to fly together in pairs, or in the</p>
<p>uninstructive but mutually satisfactory converse which Strephon</p>
<p>holds with Chloe while they dally along the primrose path.</p>
<p>I am glad that even the stony and tumultuous city affords some</p>
<p>opportunities for these amiable observations.  In the month of April</p>
<p>there is hardly a clump of shrubbery in the Central Park which will</p>
<p>not serve as a trysting-place for yellow warblers and catbirds just</p>
<p>home from their southern tours.  At the same time, you shall see</p>
<p>many a bench, designed for the accommodation of six persons,</p>
<p>occupied at the sunset hour by only two, and apparently so much too</p>
<p>small for them that they cannot avoid a little crowding.</p>
<p>These are infallible signs.  Taken in conjunction with the eruption</p>
<p>of tops and marbles among the small boys, and the purchase of</p>
<p>fishing-tackle and golf-clubs by the old boys, they certify us that</p>
<p>the vernal equinox has arrived, not only in the celestial regions,</p>
<p>but also in the heart of man.</p>
<p>I have been reflecting of late upon the relation of lovers to the</p>
<p>landscape, and questioning whether art has given it quite the same</p>
<p>place as that which belongs to it in nature.  In fiction, for</p>
<p>example, and in the drama, and in music, I have some vague</p>
<p>misgivings that romantic love has come to hold a more prominent and</p>
<p>a more permanent position than it fills in real life.</p>
<p>This is dangerous ground to venture upon, even in the most modest</p>
<p>and deprecatory way.  The man who expresses an opinion, or even a</p>
<p>doubt, on this subject, contrary to the ruling traditions, will have</p>
<p>a swarm of angry critics buzzing about him.  He will be called a</p>
<p>heretic, a heathen, a cold-blooded freak of nature.  As for the</p>
<p>woman who hesitates to subscribe all the thirty-nine articles of</p>
<p>romantic love, if such a one dares to put her reluctance into words,</p>
<p>she is certain to be accused either of unwomanly ambition or of</p>
<p>feminine disappointment.</p>
<p>Let us make haste, then, to get back for safety to the</p>
<p>ornithological aspect of the subject.  Here there can be no</p>
<p>penalties for heresy.  And here I make bold to avow my conviction</p>
<p>that the pairing season is not the only point of interest in the</p>
<p>life of the birds; nor is the instinct by which they mate altogether</p>
<p>and beyond comparison the noblest passion that stirs their feathered</p>
<p>breasts.</p>
<p>&#x27;T is true, the time of mating is their prettiest season; but it is</p>
<p>very short.  How little we should know of the drama of their airy</p>
<p>life if we had eyes only for this brief scene!  Their finest</p>
<p>qualities come out in the patient cares that protect the young in</p>
<p>the nest, in the varied struggles for existence through the changing</p>
<p>year, and in the incredible heroisms of the annual migrations.</p>
<p>Herein is a parable.</p>
<p>It may be observed further, without fear of rebuke, that the</p>
<p>behaviour of the different kinds of birds during the prevalence of</p>
<p>romantic love is not always equally above reproach.  The courtship</p>
<p>of English sparrows--blustering, noisy, vulgar--is a sight to offend</p>
<p>the taste of every gentle on-looker.  Some birds reiterate and</p>
<p>vociferate their love-songs in a fashion that displays their</p>
<p>inconsiderateness as well as their ignorance of music.  This trait</p>
<p>is most marked in domestic fowls.  There was a guinea-cock, once,</p>
<p>that chose to do his wooing close under the window of a farm-house</p>
<p>where I was lodged.  He had no regard for my hours of sleep or</p>
<p>meditation.  His amatory click-clack prevented the morning and</p>
<p>wrecked the tranquillity of the evening.  It was odious, brutal,--</p>
<p>worse, it was absolutely thoughtless.  Herein is another parable.</p>
<p>Let us admit cheerfully that lovers have a place in the landscape</p>
<p>and lend a charm to it.  This does not mean that they are to take up</p>
<p>all the room there is.  Suppose, for example, that a pair of them,</p>
<p>on Goat Island, put themselves in such a position as to completely</p>
<p>block out your view of Niagara.  You cannot regard them with</p>
<p>gratitude.  They even become a little tedious.  Or suppose that you</p>
<p>are visiting at a country-house, and you find that you must not</p>
<p>enjoy the moonlight on the verandah because Augustus and Amanda are</p>
<p>murmuring in one corner, and that you must not go into the garden</p>
<p>because Louis and Lizzie are there, and that you cannot have a sail</p>
<p>on the lake because Richard and Rebecca have taken the boat.</p>
<p>Of course, unless you happen to be a selfish old curmudgeon, you</p>
<p>rejoice, by sympathy, in the happiness of these estimable young</p>
<p>people.  But you fail to see why it should cover so much ground.</p>
<p>Why should they not pool their interests, and all go out in the</p>
<p>boat, or all walk in the garden, or all sit on the verandah?  Then</p>
<p>there would be room for somebody else about the place.</p>
<p>In old times you could rely upon lovers for retirement.  But</p>
<p>nowadays their role seems to be a bold ostentation of their</p>
<p>condition.  They rely upon other people to do the timid, shrinking</p>
<p>part.  Society, in America, is arranged principally for their</p>
<p>convenience; and whatever portion of the landscape strikes their</p>
<p>fancy, they preempt and occupy.  All this goes upon the presumption</p>
<p>that romantic love is really the only important interest in life.</p>
<p>This train of thought was illuminated, the other night, by an</p>
<p>incident which befell me at a party.  It was an assembly of men,</p>
<p>drawn together by their common devotion to the sport of canoeing.</p>
<p>There were only three or four of the gentler sex present (as</p>
<p>honorary members), and only one of whom it could be suspected that</p>
<p>she was at that time a victim or an object of the tender passion.</p>
<p>In the course of the evening, by way of diversion to our</p>
<p>disputations on keels and centreboards, canvas and birch-bark,</p>
<p>cedar-wood and bass-wood, paddles and steering-gear, a fine young</p>
<p>Apollo, with a big, manly voice, sang us a few songs.  But he did</p>
<p>not chant the joys of weathering a sudden squall, or running a rapid</p>
<p>feather-white with foam, or floating down a long, quiet, elm-bowered</p>
<p>river.  Not all.  His songs were full of sighs and yearnings,</p>
<p>languid lips and sheep&#x27;s-eyes.  His powerful voice informed us that</p>
<p>crowns of thorns seemed like garlands of roses, and kisses were as</p>
<p>sweet as samples of heaven, and various other curious sensations</p>
<p>were experienced; and at the end of every stanza the reason was</p>
<p>stated, in tones of thunder--</p>

<p>Even if true, it seemed inappropriate.  How foolish the average</p>
<p>audience in a drawing-room looks while it is listening to passionate</p>
<p>love-ditties!  And yet I suppose the singer chose these songs, not</p>
<p>from any malice aforethought, but simply because songs of this kind</p>
<p>are so abundant that it is next to impossible to find anything else</p>
<p>in the shops.</p>
<p>In regard to novels, the situation is almost as discouraging.  Ten</p>
<p>love-stories are printed to one of any other kind.  We have a</p>
<p>standing invitation to consider the tribulations and difficulties of</p>
<p>some young man or young woman in finding a mate.  It must be</p>
<p>admitted that the subject has its capabilities of interest.  Nature</p>
<p>has her uses for the lover, and she gives him an excellent part to</p>
<p>play in the drama of life.  But is this tantamount to saying that</p>
<p>his interest is perennial and all-absorbing, and that his role on</p>
<p>the stage is the only one that is significant and noteworthy?</p>
<p>Life is much too large to be expressed in the terms of a single</p>
<p>passion.  Friendship, patriotism, parental tenderness, filial</p>
<p>devotion, the ardour of adventure, the thirst for knowledge, the</p>
<p>ecstasy of religion,--these all have their dwelling in the heart of</p>
<p>man.  They mould character.  They control conduct.  They are stars</p>
<p>of destiny shining in the inner firmament.  And if art would truly</p>
<p>hold the mirror up to nature, it must reflect these greater and</p>
<p>lesser lights that rule the day and the night.</p>
<p>How many of the plays that divert and misinform the modern theatre-</p>
<p>goer turn on the pivot of a love-affair, not always pure, but</p>
<p>generally simple!  And how many of those that are imported from</p>
<p>France proceed upon the theory that the Seventh is the only</p>
<p>Commandment, and that the principal attraction of life lies in the</p>
<p>opportunity of breaking it!  The matinee-girl is not likely to have</p>
<p>a very luminous or truthful idea of existence floating around in her</p>
<p>pretty little head.</p>
<p>But, after all, the great plays, those that take the deepest hold</p>
<p>upon the heart, like HAMLET and KING LEAR, MACBETH and OTHELLO, are</p>
<p>not love-plays.  And the most charming comedies, like THE WINTER&#x27;S</p>
<p>TALE, and THE RIVALS, and RIP VAN WINKLE, are chiefly memorable for</p>
<p>other things than love-scenes.</p>
<p>Even in novels, love shows at its best when it does not absorb the</p>
<p>whole plot.  LORNA DOONE is a lovers&#x27; story, but there is a blessed</p>
<p>minimum of spooning in it, and always enough of working and fighting</p>
<p>to keep the air clear and fresh.  THE HEART OF MIDLOTHIAN, and</p>
<p>HYPATIA, and ROMOLA, and THE CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH, and JOHN</p>
<p>INGLESANT, and THE THREE MUSKETEERS, and NOTRE DAME, and PEACE AND</p>
<p>WAR, and QUO VADIS,--these are great novels because they are much</p>
<p>more than tales of romantic love.  As for HENRY ESMOND, (which seems</p>
<p>to me the best of all,) certainly &quot;love at first sight&quot; does not</p>
<p>play the finest role in that book.</p>
<p>There are good stories of our own day--pathetic, humourous,</p>
<p>entertaining, powerful--in which the element of romantic love is</p>
<p>altogether subordinate, or even imperceptible.  THE RISE OF SILAS</p>
<p>LAPHAM does not owe its deep interest to the engagement of the very</p>
<p>charming young people who enliven it.  MADAME DELPHINE and OLE</p>
<p>&#x27;STRACTED are perfect stories of their kind.  I would not barter THE</p>
<p>JUNGLE BOOKS for a hundred of THE BRUSHWOOD BOY.</p>
<p>The truth is that love, considered merely as the preference of one</p>
<p>person for another of the opposite sex, is not &quot;the greatest thing</p>
<p>in the world.&quot;  It becomes great only when it leads on, as it often</p>
<p>does, to heroism and self-sacrifice and fidelity.  Its chief value</p>
<p>for art (the interpreter) lies not in itself, but in its quickening</p>
<p>relation to the other elements of life.  It must be seen and shown</p>
<p>in its due proportion, and in harmony with the broader landscape.</p>
<p>Do you believe that in all the world there is only one woman</p>
<p>specially created for each man, and that the order of the universe</p>
<p>will be hopelessly askew unless these two needles find each other in</p>
<p>the haystack?  You believe it for yourself, perhaps; but do you</p>
<p>believe it for Tom Johnson?  You remember what a terrific</p>
<p>disturbance he made in the summer of 189-, at Bar Harbor, about</p>
<p>Ellinor Brown, and how he ran away with her in September.  You have</p>
<p>also seen them together (occasionally) at Lenox and Newport, since</p>
<p>their marriage.  Are you honestly of the opinion that if Tom had not</p>
<p>married Ellinor, these two young lives would have been a total</p>
<p>wreck?</p>
<p>Adam Smith, in his book on THE MORAL SENTIMENTS, goes so far as to</p>
<p>say that &quot;love is not interesting to the observer because it is AN</p>
<p>AFFECTION OF THE IMAGINATION, into which it is difficult for a third</p>
<p>party to enter.&quot;  Something of the same kind occurred to me in</p>
<p>regard to Tom and Ellinor.  Yet I would not have presumed to suggest</p>
<p>this thought to either of them.  Nor would I have quoted in their</p>
<p>hearing the melancholy and frigid prediction of Ralph Waldo Emerson,</p>
<p>to the effect that they would some day discover &quot;that all which at</p>
<p>first drew them together--those once sacred features, that magical</p>
<p>play of charm--was deciduous.&quot;</p>
<p>DECIDUOUS, indeed?  Cold, unpleasant, botanical word!  Rather would</p>
<p>I prognosticate for the lovers something perennial,</p>

<p>rest of us were hardened to it.</p>
<p>When he married Cornelia Cochrane, we were consoled for our partial</p>
<p>loss by the apparent fitness and brilliancy of the match.  If</p>
<p>Beekman was a masterful man, Cornelia was certainly what you might</p>
<p>call a mistressful woman.  She had been the head of her house since</p>
<p>she was eighteen years old.  She carried her good looks like the</p>
<p>family plate; and when she came into the breakfast-room and said</p>
<p>good-morning, it was with an air as if she presented every one with</p>
<p>a check for a thousand dollars.  Her tastes were accepted as</p>
<p>judgments, and her preferences had the force of laws.  Wherever she</p>
<p>wanted to go in the summer-time, there the finger of household</p>
<p>destiny pointed.  At Newport, at Bar Harbour, at Lenox, at</p>
<p>Southampton, she made a record.  When she was joined in holy wedlock</p>
<p>to Beekman De Peyster, her father and mother heaved a sigh of</p>
<p>satisfaction, and settled down for a quiet vacation in Cherry</p>
<p>Valley.</p>
<p>It was in the second summer after the wedding that Beekman admitted</p>
<p>to a few of his ancient Petrine cronies, in moments of confidence</p>
<p>(unjustifiable, but natural), that his wife had one fault.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not exactly a fault,&quot; he said, &quot;not a positive fault, you</p>
<p>know.  It is just a kind of a defect, due to her education, of</p>
<p>course.  In everything else she&#x27;s magnificent.  But she does n&#x27;t</p>
<p>care for fishing.  &quot;</p>
<p>to survive the evanescence of love&#x27;s young dream.  Ellinor should</p>
<p>turn out to be a woman like the Lady Elizabeth Hastings, of whom</p>
<p>Richard Steele wrote that &quot;to love her was a liberal education.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom should prove that he had in him the lasting stuff of a true man</p>
<p>and a hero.  Then it would make little difference whether their</p>
<p>conjunction had been eternally prescribed in the book of fate or</p>
<p>not.  It would be evidently a fit match, made on earth and</p>
<p>illustrative of heaven.</p>
<p>But even in the making of such a match as this, the various stages</p>
<p>of attraction, infatuation, and appropriation should not be</p>
<p>displayed too prominently before the world, nor treated as events of</p>
<p>overwhelming importance and enduring moment.  I would not counsel</p>
<p>Tom and Ellinor, in the midsummer of their engagement, to have their</p>
<p>photographs taken together in affectionate attitudes.</p>
<p>The pictures of an imaginary kind which deal with the subject of</p>
<p>romantic love are, almost without exception, fatuous and futile.</p>
<p>The inanely amatory, with their languishing eyes, weary us.  The</p>
<p>endlessly osculatory, with their protracted salutations, are</p>
<p>sickening.  Even when an air of sentimental propriety is thrown</p>
<p>about them by some such title as &quot;Wedded&quot; or &quot;The Honeymoon,&quot; they</p>
<p>fatigue us.  For the most part, they remind me of the remark which</p>
<p>the Commodore made upon a certain painting of Jupiter and lo which</p>
<p>hangs in the writing-room of the Contrary Club.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; said that gently piercing critic, &quot;that picture is equally</p>
<p>unsatisfactory to the artist, to the moralist, and to the</p>
<p>voluptuary.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, having made a clean breast of my misgivings and</p>
<p>reservations on the subject of lovers and landscape, I will now</p>
<p>confess that the whole of my doubts do not weigh much against my</p>
<p>unreasoned faith in romantic love.  At heart I am no infidel, but a</p>
<p>most obstinate believer and devotee.  My seasons of skepticism are</p>
<p>transient.  They are connected with a torpid liver and aggravated by</p>
<p>confinement to a sedentary life and enforced abstinence from</p>
<p>angling.  Out-of-doors, I return to a saner and happier frame of</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>As my wheel rolls along the Riverside Drive in the golden glow of</p>
<p>the sunset, I rejoice that the episode of Charles Henry and Matilda</p>
<p>Jane has not been omitted from the view.  This vast and populous</p>
<p>city, with all its passing show of life, would be little better than</p>
<p>a waste, howling wilderness if we could not catch a glimpse, now and</p>
<p>then, of young people falling in love in the good old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>Even on a trout-stream, I have seen nothing prettier than the sight</p>
<p>upon which I once came suddenly as I was fishing down the Neversink.</p>
<p>A boy was kneeling beside the brook, and a girl was giving him a</p>
<p>drink of water out of her rosy hands.  They stared with wonder and</p>
<p>compassion at the wet and solitary angler, wading down the stream,</p>
<p>as if he were some kind of a mild lunatic.  But as I glanced</p>
<p>discreetly at their small tableau, I was not unconscious of the new</p>
<p>joy that came into the landscape with the presence of</p>

<p>I knew how sweet the water tasted from that kind of a cup.  I also</p>
<p>have lived in Arcadia, and have not forgotten the way back.</p>
<p>A FATAL SUCCESS</p>
<p>&quot;What surprises me in her behaviour,&quot; said he, &quot;is its thoroughness.</p>
<p>Woman seldom does things by halves, but often by doubles.&quot;--SOLOMON</p>
<p>SINGLEWITZ: The Life of Adam.</p>
<p>Beekman De Peyster was probably the most passionate and triumphant</p>
<p>fisherman in the Petrine Club.  He angled with the same dash and</p>
<p>confidence that he threw into his operations in the stock-market.</p>
<p>He was sure to be the first man to get his flies on the water at the</p>
<p>opening of the season.  And when we came together for our fall</p>
<p>meeting, to compare notes of our wanderings on various streams and</p>
<p>make up the fish-stories for the year, Beekman was almost always</p>
<p>&quot;high hook.&quot;  We expected, as a matter of course, to hear that he</p>
<p>had taken the most and the largest fish.</p>
<p>It was so with everything that he undertook.  He was a masterful</p>
<p>man.  If there was an unusually large trout in a river, Beekman knew</p>
<p>about it before any one else, and got there first, and came home</p>
<p>with the fish.  It did not make him unduly proud, because there was</p>
<p>nothing unShe says it &#x27;s stupid,--can&#x27;t see why any one</p>
<p>should like the woods,--calls camping out the lunatic&#x27;s diversion.</p>
<p>It &#x27;s rather awkward for a man with my habits to have his wife take</p>
<p>such a view.  But it can be changed by training.  I intend to</p>
<p>educate her and convert her.  I shall make an angler of her yet.&quot;</p>
<p>And so he did.</p>
<p>The new education was begun in the Adirondacks, and the first lesson</p>
<p>was given at Paul Smith&#x27;s.  It was a complete failure.</p>
<p>Beekman persuaded her to come out with him for a day on Meacham</p>
<p>River, and promised to convince her of the charm of angling.  She</p>
<p>wore a new gown, fawn-colour and violet, with a picture-hat, very</p>
<p>taking.  But the Meacham River trout was shy that day; not even</p>
<p>Beekman could induce him to rise to the fly.  What the trout lacked</p>
<p>in confidence the mosquitoes more than made up.  Mrs. De Peyster</p>
<p>came home much sunburned, and expressed a highly unfavourable</p>
<p>opinion of fishing as an amusement and of Meacham River as a resort.</p>
<p>&quot;The nice people don&#x27;t come to the Adirondacks to fish,&quot; said she;</p>
<p>&quot;they come to talk about the fishing twenty years ago.  Besides,</p>
<p>what do you want to catch that trout for?  If you do, the other men</p>
<p>will say you bought it, and the hotel will have to put in a new one</p>
<p>for the rest of the season.&quot;</p>
<p>The following year Beekman tried Moosehead Lake.  Here he found an</p>
<p>atmosphere more favourable to his plan of education.  There were a</p>
<p>good many people who really fished, and short expeditions in the</p>
<p>woods were quite fashionable.  Cornelia had a camping-costume of the</p>
<p>most approved style made by Dewlap on Fifth Avenue,--pearl-gray with</p>
<p>linings of rose-silk,--and consented to go with her husband on a</p>
<p>trip up Moose River.  They pitched their tent the first evening at</p>
<p>the mouth of Misery Stream, and a storm came on.  The rain sifted</p>
<p>through the canvas in a fine spray, and Mrs. De Peyster sat up all</p>
<p>night in a waterproof cloak, holding an umbrella.  The next day they</p>
<p>were back at the hotel in time for lunch.</p>
<p>&quot;It was horrid,&quot; she told her most intimate friend, &quot;perfectly</p>
<p>horrid.  The idea of sleeping in a shower-bath, and eating your</p>
<p>breakfast from a tin plate, just for sake of catching a few silly</p>
<p>fish!  Why not send your guides out to get them for you?&quot;</p>
<p>But, in spite of this profession of obstinate heresy, Beekman</p>
<p>observed with secret joy that there were signs, before the end of</p>
<p>the season, that Cornelia was drifting a little, a very little but</p>
<p>still perceptibly, in the direction of a change of heart.  She began</p>
<p>to take an interest, as the big trout came along in September, in</p>
<p>the reports of the catches made by the different anglers.  She would</p>
<p>saunter out with the other people to the corner of the porch to see</p>
<p>the fish weighed and spread out on the grass.  Several times she</p>
<p>went with Beekman in the canoe to Hardscrabble Point, and showed</p>
<p>distinct evidences of pleasure when he caught large trout.  The last</p>
<p>day of the season, when he returned from a successful expedition to</p>
<p>Roach River and Lily Bay, she inquired with some particularity about</p>
<p>the results of his sport; and in the evening, as the company sat</p>
<p>before the great open fire in the hall of the hotel, she was heard</p>
<p>to use this information with considerable skill in putting down Mrs.</p>
<p>Minot Peabody of Boston, who was recounting the details of her</p>
<p>husband&#x27;s catch at Spencer Pond.  Cornelia was not a person to be</p>
<p>contented with the back seat, even in fish-stories.</p>
<p>When Beekman observed these indications he was much encouraged, and</p>
<p>resolved to push his educational experiment briskly forward to his</p>
<p>customary goal of success.</p>
<p>&quot;Some things can be done, as well as others,&quot; he said in his</p>
<p>masterful way, as three of us were walking home together after the</p>
<p>autumnal dinner of the Petrine Club, which he always attended as a</p>
<p>graduate member.  &quot;A real fisherman never gives up.  I told you I&#x27;d</p>
<p>make an angler out of my wife; and so I will.  It has been rather</p>
<p>difficult.  She is &#x27;dour&#x27; in rising.  But she&#x27;s beginning to take</p>
<p>notice of the fly now.  Give me another season, and I&#x27;ll have her</p>
<p>landed.&quot;</p>
<p>Good old Beekman!  Little did he think--  But I must not interrupt</p>
<p>the story with moral reflections.</p>
<p>The preparations that he made for his final effort at conversion</p>
<p>were thorough and prudent.  He had a private interview with Dewlap</p>
<p>in regard to the construction of a practical fishing-costume for a</p>
<p>lady, which resulted in something more reasonable and workmanlike</p>
<p>than had ever been turned out by that famous artist.  He ordered</p>
<p>from Hook and Catchett a lady&#x27;s angling-outfit of the most enticing</p>
<p>description,--a split-bamboo rod, light as a girl&#x27;s wish, and strong</p>
<p>as a matron&#x27;s will; an oxidized silver reel, with a monogram on one</p>
<p>side, and a sapphire set in the handle for good luck; a book of</p>
<p>flies, of all sizes and colours, with the correct names inscribed in</p>
<p>gilt letters on each page.  He surrounded his favourite sport with</p>
<p>an aureole of elegance and beauty.  And then he took Cornelia in</p>
<p>September to the Upper Dam at Rangeley.</p>
<p>She went reluctant.  She arrived disgusted.  She stayed incredulous.</p>
<p>She returned--  Wait a bit, and you shall hear how she returned.</p>
<p>The Upper Dam at Rangeley is the place, of all others in the world,</p>
<p>where the lunacy of angling may be seen in its incurable stage.</p>
<p>There is a cosy little inn, called a camp, at the foot of a big</p>
<p>lake.  In front of the inn is a huge dam of gray stone, over which</p>
<p>the river plunges into a great oval pool, where the trout assemble</p>
<p>in the early fall to perpetuate their race.  From the tenth of</p>
<p>September to the thirtieth, there is not an hour of the day or night</p>
<p>when there are no boats floating on that pool, and no anglers</p>
<p>trailing the fly across its waters.  Before the late fishermen are</p>
<p>ready to come in at midnight, the early fishermen may be seen</p>
<p>creeping down to the shore with lanterns in order to begin before</p>
<p>cock-crow.  The number of fish taken is not large,--perhaps five or</p>
<p>six for the whole company on an average day,--but the size is</p>
<p>sometimes enormous,--nothing under three pounds is counted,--and</p>
<p>they pervade thought and conversation at the Upper Dam to the</p>
<p>exclusion of every other subject.  There is no driving, no dancing,</p>
<p>no golf, no tennis.  There is nothing to do but fish or die.</p>
<p>At first, Cornelia thought she would choose the latter alternative.</p>
<p>But a remark of that skilful and morose old angler, McTurk, which</p>
<p>she overheard on the verandah after supper, changed her mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Women have no sporting instinct,&quot; said he.  &quot;They only fish because</p>
<p>they see men doing it.  They are imitative animals.&quot;</p>
<p>That same night she told Beekman, in the subdued tone which the</p>
<p>architectural construction of the house imposes upon all</p>
<p>confidential communications in the bedrooms, but with resolution in</p>
<p>every accent, that she proposed to go fishing with him on the</p>
<p>morrow.</p>
<p>&quot;But not on that pool, right in front of the house, you understand.</p>
<p>There must be some other place, out on the lake, where we can fish</p>
<p>for three or four days, until I get the trick of this wobbly rod.</p>
<p>Then I&#x27;ll show that old bear, McTurk, what kind of an animal woman</p>
<p>is.</p>
<p>Beekman was simply delighted.  Five days of diligent practice at the</p>
<p>mouth of Mill Brook brought his pupil to the point where he</p>
<p>pronounced her safe.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; he said patronizingly, &quot;you have &#x27;nt learned all about</p>
<p>it yet.  That will take years.  But you can get your fly out thirty</p>
<p>feet, and you can keep the tip of your rod up.  If you do that, the</p>
<p>trout will hook himself, in rapid water, eight times out of ten.</p>
<p>For playing him, if you follow my directions, you &#x27;ll be all right.</p>
<p>We will try the pool tonight, and hope for a medium-sized fish.&quot;</p>
<p>Cornelia said nothing, but smiled and nodded.  She had her own</p>
<p>thoughts.</p>
<p>At about nine o&#x27;clock Saturday night, they anchored their boat on</p>
<p>the edge of the shoal where the big eddy swings around, put out the</p>
<p>lantern and began to fish.  Beekman sat in the bow of the boat, with</p>
<p>his rod over the left side; Cornelia in the stern, with her rod over</p>
<p>the right side.  The night was cloudy and very black.  Each of them</p>
<p>had put on the largest possible fly, one a &quot;Bee-Pond&quot; and the other</p>
<p>a &quot;Dragon;&quot; but even these were invisible.  They measured out the</p>
<p>right length of line, and let the flies drift back until they hung</p>
<p>over the shoal, in the curly water where the two currents meet.</p>
<p>There were three other boats to the left of them.  McTurk was their</p>
<p>only neighbour in the darkness on the right.  Once they heard him</p>
<p>swearing softly to himself, and knew that he had hooked and lost a</p>
<p>fish.</p>
<p>Away down at the tail of the pool, dimly visible through the gloom,</p>
<p>the furtive fisherman, Parsons, had anchored his boat.  No noise</p>
<p>ever came from that craft.  If he wished to change his position, he</p>
<p>did not pull up the anchor and let it down again with a bump.  He</p>
<p>simply lengthened or shortened his anchor rope.  There was no click</p>
<p>of the reel when he played a fish.  He drew in and paid out the line</p>
<p>through the rings by hand, without a sound.  What he thought when a</p>
<p>fish got away, no one knew, for he never said it.  He concealed his</p>
<p>angling as if it had been a conspiracy.  Twice that night they heard</p>
<p>a faint splash in the water near his boat, and twice they saw him</p>
<p>put his arm over the side in the darkness and bring it back again</p>
<p>very quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;That &#x27;s the second fish for Parsons,&quot; whispered Beekman, &quot;what a</p>
<p>secretive old Fortunatus he is!  He knows more about fishing than</p>
<p>any man on the pool, and talks less.&quot;</p>
<p>Cornelia did not answer.  Her thoughts were all on the tip of her</p>
<p>own rod.  About eleven o&#x27;clock a fine, drizzling rain set in.  The</p>
<p>fishing was very slack.  All the other boats gave it up in despair;</p>
<p>but Cornelia said she wanted to stay out a little longer, they might</p>
<p>as well finish up the week.</p>
<p>At precisely fifty minutes past eleven, Beekman reeled up his line,</p>
<p>and remarked with firmness that the holy Sabbath day was almost at</p>
<p>hand and they ought to go in.</p>
<p>&quot;Not till I &#x27;ve landed this trout,&quot; said Cornelia.</p>
<p>&quot;What?  A trout!  Have you got one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly; I &#x27;ve had him on for at least fifteen minutes.  I &#x27;m</p>
<p>playing him Mr. Parsons&#x27; way.  You might as well light the lantern</p>
<p>and get the net ready; he &#x27;s coming in towards the boat now.&quot;</p>
<p>Beekman broke three matches before he made the lantern burn; and</p>
<p>when he held it up over the gunwale, there was the trout sure</p>
<p>enough, gleaming ghostly pale in the dark water, close to the boat,</p>
<p>and quite tired out.  He slipped the net over the fish and drew it</p>
<p>in,--a monster.</p>
<p>&quot;I &#x27;ll carry that trout, if you please,&quot; said Cornelia, as they</p>
<p>stepped out of the boat; and she walked into the camp, on the last</p>
<p>stroke of midnight, with the fish in her hand, and quietly asked for</p>
<p>the steelyard.</p>
<p>Eight pounds and fourteen ounces,--that was the weight.  Everybody</p>
<p>was amazed.  It was the &quot;best fish&quot; of the year.  Cornelia showed no</p>
<p>sign of exultation, until just as John was carrying the trout to the</p>
<p>ice-house.  Then she flashed out:--&quot;Quite a fair imitation, Mr.</p>
<p>McTurk,--is n&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>Now McTurk&#x27;s best record for the last fifteen years was seven pounds</p>
<p>and twelve ounces.</p>
<p>So far as McTurk is concerned, this is the end of the story.  But</p>
<p>not for the De Peysters.  I wish it were.  Beekman went to sleep</p>
<p>that night with a contented spirit.  He felt that his experiment in</p>
<p>education had been a success.  He had made his wife an angler.</p>
<p>He had indeed, and to an extent which he little suspected.  That</p>
<p>Upper Dam trout was to her like the first taste of blood to the</p>
<p>tiger.  It seemed to change, at once, not so much her character as</p>
<p>the direction of her vital energy.  She yielded to the lunacy of</p>
<p>angling, not by slow degrees, (as first a transient delusion, then a</p>
<p>fixed idea, then a chronic infirmity, finally a mild insanity,) but</p>
<p>by a sudden plunge into the most violent mania.  So far from being</p>
<p>ready to die at Upper Dam, her desire now was to live there--and to</p>
<p>live solely for the sake of fishing--as long as the season was open.</p>
<p>There were two hundred and forty hours left to midnight on the</p>
<p>thirtieth of September.  At least two hundred of these she spent on</p>
<p>the pool; and when Beekman was too exhausted to manage the boat and</p>
<p>the net and the lantern for her, she engaged a trustworthy guide to</p>
<p>take Beekman&#x27;s place while he slept.  At the end of the last day her</p>
<p>score was twenty-three, with an average of five pounds and a</p>
<p>quarter.  His score was nine, with an average of four pounds.  He</p>
<p>had succeeded far beyond his wildest hopes.</p>
<p>The next year his success became even more astonishing.  They went</p>
<p>to the Titan Club in Canada.  The ugliest and most inaccessible</p>
<p>sheet of water in that territory is Lake Pharaoh.  But it is famous</p>
<p>for the extraordinary fishing at a certain spot near the outlet,</p>
<p>where there is just room enough for one canoe.  They camped on Lake</p>
<p>Pharaoh for six weeks, by Mrs. De Peyster&#x27;s command; and her canoe</p>
<p>was always the first to reach the fishing-ground in the morning, and</p>
<p>the last to leave it in the evening.</p>
<p>Some one asked him, when he returned to the city, whether he had</p>
<p>good luck.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite fair,&quot; he tossed off in a careless way; &quot;we took over three</p>
<p>hundred pounds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To your own rod?&quot; asked the inquirer, in admiration.</p>
<p>&quot;No-o-o,&quot; said Beekman, &quot;there were two of us.&quot;</p>
<p>There were two of them, also, the following year, when they joined</p>
<p>the Natasheebo Salmon Club and fished that celebrated river in</p>
<p>Labrador.  The custom of drawing lots every night for the water that</p>
<p>each member was to angle over the next day, seemed to be especially</p>
<p>designed to fit the situation.  Mrs. De Peyster could fish her own</p>
<p>pool and her husband&#x27;s too.  The result of that year&#x27;s fishing was</p>
<p>something phenomenal.  She had a score that made a paragraph in the</p>
<p>newspapers and called out editorial comment.  One editor was so</p>
<p>inadequate to the situation as to entitle the article in which he</p>
<p>described her triumph &quot;The Equivalence of Woman.&quot;  It was well-</p>
<p>meant, but she was not at all pleased with it.</p>
<p>She was now not merely an angler, but a &quot;record&quot; angler of the most</p>
<p>virulent type.  Wherever they went, she wanted, and she got, the</p>
<p>pick of the water.  She seemed to be equally at home on all kinds of</p>
<p>streams, large and small.  She would pursue the little mountain-</p>
<p>brook trout in the early spring, and the Labrador salmon in July,</p>
<p>and the huge speckled trout of the northern lakes in September, with</p>
<p>the same avidity and resolution.  All that she cared for was to get</p>
<p>the best and the most of the fishing at each place where she angled.</p>
<p>This she always did.</p>
<p>And Beekman,--well, for him there were no more long separations from</p>
<p>the partner of his life while he went off to fish some favourite</p>
<p>stream.  There were no more home-comings after a good day&#x27;s sport to</p>
<p>find her clad in cool and dainty raiment on the verandah, ready to</p>
<p>welcome him with friendly badinage.  There was not even any casting</p>
<p>of the fly around Hardscrabble Point while she sat in the canoe</p>
<p>reading a novel, looking up with mild and pleasant interest when he</p>
<p>caught a larger fish than usual, as an older and wiser person looks</p>
<p>at a child playing some innocent game.  Those days of a divided</p>
<p>interest between man and wife were gone.  She was now fully</p>
<p>converted, and more.  Beekman and Cornelia were one; and she was the</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>The last time I saw the De Peysters he was following her along the</p>
<p>Beaverkill, carrying a landing-net and a basket, but no rod.  She</p>
<p>paused for a moment to exchange greetings, and then strode on down</p>
<p>the stream.  He lingered for a few minutes longer to light a pipe.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, old man,&quot; I said, &quot;you certainly have succeeded in making an</p>
<p>angler of Mrs. De Peyster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; he answered,--&quot;have n&#x27;t I?&quot;  Then he continued, after</p>
<p>a few thoughtful puffs of smoke, &quot;Do you know, I &#x27;m not quite so</p>
<p>sure as I used to be that fishing is the best of all sports.  I</p>
<p>sometimes think of giving it up and going in for croquet.&quot;</p>
<p>FISHING IN BOOKS</p>
<p>&quot;SIMPSON.--Have you ever seen any American books on angling, Fisher?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;FISHER.--No, I do not think there are any published.  Brother</p>
<p>Jonathan is not yet sufficiently civilized to produce anything</p>
<p>original on the gentle art.  There is good trout-fishing in America,</p>
<p>and the streams, which are all free, are much less fished than in</p>
<p>our Island, &#x27;from the small number of gentlemen,&#x27; as an American</p>
<p>writer says, &#x27;who are at leisure to give their time to it.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>--WILLIAM ANDREW CHATTO: The Angler&#x27;s Souvenir (London, 1835).</p>
<p>That wise man and accomplished scholar, Sir Henry Wotton, the friend</p>
<p>of Izaak Walton and ambassador of King James I to the republic of</p>
<p>Venice, was accustomed to say that &quot;he would rather live five May</p>
<p>months than forty Decembers.&quot;  The reason for this preference was no</p>
<p>secret to those who knew him.  It had nothing to do with British or</p>
<p>Venetian politics.  It was simply because December, with all its</p>
<p>domestic joys, is practically a dead month in the angler&#x27;s calendar.</p>
<p>His occupation is gone.  The better sort of fish are out of season.</p>
<p>The trout are lean and haggard: it is no trick to catch them and no</p>
<p>treat to eat them.  The salmon, all except the silly kelts, have run</p>
<p>out to sea, and the place of their habitation no man kno his goings, that only three</p>
<p>other writers, so far as I know, have ever spoken ill of him.</p>
<p>weth.  There</p>
<p>is nothing for the angler to do but wait for the return of spring,</p>
<p>and meanwhile encourage and sustain his patience with such small</p>
<p>consolations in kind as a friendly Providence may put within his</p>
<p>reach.</p>
<p>Some solace may be found, on a day of crisp, wintry weather, in the</p>
<p>childish diversion of catching pickerel through the ice.  This</p>
<p>method of taking fish is practised on a large scale and with</p>
<p>elaborate machinery by men who supply the market.  I speak not of</p>
<p>their commercial enterprise and its gross equipage, but of ice-</p>
<p>fishing in its more sportive and desultory form, as it is pursued by</p>
<p>country boys and the incorrigible village idler.</p>
<p>You choose for this pastime a pond where the ice is not too thick,</p>
<p>lest the labour of cutting through should be discouraging; nor too</p>
<p>thin, lest the chance of breaking in should be embarrassing.  You</p>
<p>then chop out, with almost any kind of a hatchet or pick, a number</p>
<p>of holes in the ice, making each one six or eight inches in</p>
<p>diameter, and placing them about five or six feet apart.  If you</p>
<p>happen to know the course of a current flowing through the pond, or</p>
<p>the location of a shoal frequented by minnows, you will do well to</p>
<p>keep near it.  Over each hole you set a small contrivance called a</p>
<p>&quot;tilt-up.&quot;  It consists of two sticks fastened in the middle, at</p>
<p>right angles to each other.  The stronger of the two is laid across</p>
<p>the opening in the ice.  The other is thus balanced above the</p>
<p>aperture, with a baited hook and line attached to one end, while the</p>
<p>other end is adorned with a little flag.  For choice, I would have</p>
<p>the flags red.  They look gayer, and I imagine they are more lucky.</p>
<p>When you have thus baited and set your tilt-ups,--twenty or thirty</p>
<p>of them,--you may put on your skates and amuse yourself by gliding</p>
<p>to and fro on the smooth surface of the ice, cutting figures of</p>
<p>eight and grapevines and diamond twists, while you wait for the</p>
<p>pickerel to begin their part of the performance.  They will let you</p>
<p>know when they are ready.</p>
<p>A fish, swimming around in the dim depths under the ice, sees one of</p>
<p>your baits, fancies it, and takes it in.  The moment he tries to run</p>
<p>away with it he tilts the little red flag into the air and waves it</p>
<p>backward and forward.  &quot;Be quick!&quot; he signals all unconsciously;</p>
<p>&quot;here I am; come and pull me up!&quot;</p>
<p>When two or three flags are fluttering at the same moment, far apart</p>
<p>on the pond, you must skate with speed and haul in your lines</p>
<p>promptly.</p>
<p>How hard it is, sometimes, to decide which one you will take first!</p>
<p>That flag in the middle of the pond has been waving for at least a</p>
<p>minute; but the other, in the corner of the bay, is tilting up and</p>
<p>down more violently: it must be a larger fish.  Great Dagon! There&#x27;s</p>
<p>another red signal flying, away over by the point!  You hesitate,</p>
<p>you make a few strokes in one direction, then you whirl around and</p>
<p>dart the other way.  Meantime one of the tilt-ups, constructed with</p>
<p>too short a cross-stick, has been pulled to one side, and disappears</p>
<p>in the hole.  One pickerel in the pond carries a flag.  Another</p>
<p>tilt-up ceases to move and falls flat upon the ice.  The bait has</p>
<p>been stolen.  You dash desperately toward the third flag and pull in</p>
<p>the only fish that is left,--probably the smallest of them all!</p>
<p>A surplus of opportunities does not insure the best luck.</p>
<p>A room with seven doors--like the famous apartment in Washington&#x27;s</p>
<p>headquarters at Newburgh--is an invitation to bewilderment.  I would</p>
<p>rather see one fair opening in life than be confused by three</p>
<p>dazzling chances.</p>
<p>There was a good story about fishing through the ice which formed</p>
<p>part of the stock-in-conversation of that ingenious woodsman, Martin</p>
<p>Moody, Esquire, of Big Tupper Lake.  &quot;&#x27;T was a blame cold day,&quot; he</p>
<p>said, &quot;and the lines friz up stiffer &#x27;n a fence-wire, jus&#x27; as fast</p>
<p>as I pulled &#x27;em in, and my fingers got so dum&#x27; frosted I could n&#x27;t</p>
<p>bait the hooks.  But the fish was thicker and hungrier &#x27;n flies in</p>
<p>June.  So I jus&#x27; took a piece of bait and held it over one o&#x27; the</p>
<p>holes.  Every time a fish jumped up to git it, I &#x27;d kick him out on</p>
<p>the ice.  I tell ye, sir, I kicked out more &#x27;n four hundred pounds</p>
<p>of pick&#x27;rel that morning.  Yaas, &#x27;t was a big lot, I &#x27;low, but then</p>
<p>&#x27;t was a cold day!  I jus&#x27; stacked &#x27;em up solid, like cordwood.&quot;</p>
<p>Let us now leave this frigid subject!  Iced fishing is but a</p>
<p>chilling and unsatisfactory imitation of real sport.  The angler</p>
<p>will soon turn from it with satiety, and seek a better consolation</p>
<p>for the winter of his discontent in the entertainment of fishing in</p>
<p>books.</p>
<p>Angling is the only sport that boasts the honour of having given a</p>
<p>classic to literature.</p>
<p>Izaak Walton&#x27;s success with THE COMPLEAT ANGLER was a fine</p>
<p>illustration of fisherman&#x27;s luck.  He set out, with some aid from an</p>
<p>adept in fly-fishing and cookery, named Thomas Barker, to produce a</p>
<p>little &quot;discourse of fish and fishing&quot; which should serve as a</p>
<p>useful manual for quiet persons inclined to follow the contemplative</p>
<p>man&#x27;s recreation.  He came home with a book which has made his name</p>
<p>beloved by ten generations of gentle readers, and given him a secure</p>
<p>place in the Pantheon of letters,--not a haughty eminence, but a</p>
<p>modest niche, all his own, and ever adorned with grateful offerings</p>
<p>of fresh flowers.</p>
<p>This was great luck.  But it was well-deserved, and therefore it has</p>
<p>not been grudged or envied.</p>
<p>Walton was a man so peaceful and contented, so friendly in his</p>
<p>disposition, and so innocent in allOne was that sour-complexioned Cromwellian trooper, Richard Franck,</p>
<p>who wrote in 1658 an envious book entitled NORTHERN MEMOIRS,</p>
<p>CALCULATED FOR THE MERIDIAN OF SCOTLAND, ETC., TO WHICH IS ADDED THE</p>
<p>CONTEMPLATIVE AND PRACTICAL ANGLER.  In this book the furious Franck</p>
<p>first pays Walton the flattery of imitation, and then further adorns</p>
<p>him with abuse, calling THE COMPLEAT ANGLER &quot;an indigested octavo,</p>
<p>stuffed with morals from Dubravius and others,&quot; and more than</p>
<p>hinting that the father of anglers knew little or nothing of &quot;his</p>
<p>uncultivated art.&quot;  Walton was a Churchman and a Loyalist, you see,</p>
<p>while Franck was a Commonwealth man and an Independent.</p>
<p>The second detractor of Walton was Lord Byron, who wrote</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb in his gullet</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  Should have a hook, and a small trout to pull it.&quot;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>But Byron is certainly a poor authority on the quality of mercy.</p>
<p>His contempt need not cause an honest man overwhelming distress.  I</p>
<p>should call it a complimentary dislike.</p>
<p>The third author who expressed unpleasant sentiments in regard to</p>
<p>Walton was Leigh Hunt.  Here, again, I fancy that partizan prejudice</p>
<p>had something to do with the dislike.  Hunt was a radical in</p>
<p>politics and religion.  Moreover there was a feline strain in his</p>
<p>character, which made it necessary for him to scratch somebody now</p>
<p>and then, as a relief to his feelings.</p>
<p>Walton was a great quoter.  His book is not &quot;stuffed,&quot; as Franck</p>
<p>jealously alleged, but it is certainly well sauced with piquant</p>
<p>references to other writers, as early as the author of the Book of</p>
<p>Job, and as late as John Dennys, who betrayed to the world THE</p>
<p>SECRETS OF ANGLING in 1613.  Walton further seasoned his book with</p>
<p>fragments of information about fish and fishing, more or less</p>
<p>apocryphal, gathered from Aelian, Pliny, Plutarch, Sir Francis</p>
<p>Bacon, Dubravius, Gesner, Rondeletius, the learned Aldrovandus, the</p>
<p>venerable Bede, the divine Du Bartas, and many others.  He borrowed</p>
<p>freely for the adornment of his discourse, and did not scorn to make</p>
<p>use of what may he called LIVE QUOTATIONS,--that is to say, the</p>
<p>unpublished remarks of his near contemporaries, caught in friendly</p>
<p>conversation, or handed down by oral tradition.</p>
<p>But these various seasonings did not disguise, they only enhanced,</p>
<p>the delicate flavour of the dish which he served up to his readers.</p>
<p>This was all of his own taking, and of a sweetness quite</p>
<p>incomparable.</p>
<p>I like a writer who is original enough to water his garden with</p>
<p>quotations, without fear of being drowned out.  Such men are Charles</p>
<p>Lamb and James Russell Lowell and John Burroughs.</p>
<p>Walton&#x27;s book is as fresh as a handful of wild violets and sweet</p>
<p>lavender.  It breathes the odours of the green fields and the woods.</p>
<p>It tastes of simple, homely, appetizing things like the &quot;syllabub of</p>
<p>new verjuice in a new-made haycock&quot; which the milkwoman promised to</p>
<p>give Piscator the next time he came that way.  Its music plays the</p>

<p>Walton has been quoted even more than any of the writers whom he</p>
<p>quotes.  It would be difficult, even if it were not ungrateful, to</p>
<p>write about angling without referring to him.  Some pretty saying,</p>
<p>some wise reflection from his pages, suggests itself at almost every</p>
<p>turn of the subject.</p>
<p>And yet his book, though it be the best, is not the only readable</p>
<p>one that his favourite recreation has begotten.  The literature of</p>
<p>angling is extensive, as any one may see who will look at the list</p>
<p>of the collection presented by Mr. John Bartlett to Harvard</p>
<p>University, or study the catalogue of the piscatorial library of Mr.</p>
<p>Dean Sage, of Albany, who himself has contributed an admirable book</p>
<p>on THE RISTIGOUCHE.</p>
<p>Nor is this literature altogether composed of dry and technical</p>
<p>treatises, interesting only to the confirmed anglimaniac, or to the</p>
<p>young novice ardent in pursuit of practical information.  There is a</p>
<p>good deal of juicy reading in it.</p>
<p>Books about angling should be divided (according to De Quincey&#x27;s</p>
<p>method) into two classes,--the literature of knowledge, and the</p>
<p>literature of power.</p>
<p>The first class contains the handbooks on rods and tackle, the</p>
<p>directions how to angle for different kinds of fish, and the guides</p>
<p>to various fishing-resorts.  The weakness of these books is that</p>
<p>they soon fall out of date, as the manufacture of tackle is</p>
<p>improved, the art of angling refined, and the fish in once-famous</p>
<p>waters are educated or exterminated.</p>
<p>Alas, how transient is the fashion of this world, even in angling!</p>
<p>The old manuals with their precise instruction for trimming and</p>
<p>painting trout-rods eighteen feet long, and their painful</p>
<p>description of &quot;oyntments&quot; made of nettle-juice, fish-hawk oil,</p>
<p>camphor, cat&#x27;s fat, or assafoedita, (supposed to allure the fish,)</p>
<p>are altogether behind the age.  Many of the flies described by</p>
<p>Charles Cotton and Thomas Barker seem to have gone out of style</p>
<p>among the trout.  Perhaps familiarity has bred contempt.  Generation</p>
<p>after generation of fish have seen these same old feathered</p>
<p>confections floating on the water, and learned by sharp experience</p>
<p>that they do not taste good.  The blase trout demand something new,</p>
<p>something modern.  It is for this reason, I suppose, that an</p>
<p>altogether original fly, unheard of, startling, will often do great</p>
<p>execution in an over-fished pool.</p>
<p>Certain it is that the art of angling, in settled regions, is</p>
<p>growing more dainty and difficult.  You must cast a longer, lighter</p>
<p>line; you must use finer leaders; you must have your flies dressed</p>
<p>on smaller hooks.</p>
<p>And another thing is certain: in many places (described in the</p>
<p>ancient volumes) where fish were once abundant, they are now like</p>
<p>the shipwrecked sailors in Vergil his Aeneid,--</p>

<p>The floods themselves are also disappearing.  Mr. Edmund Clarence</p>
<p>Stedman was telling me, the other day, of the trout-brook that used</p>
<p>to run through the Connecticut village when he nourished a poet&#x27;s</p>
<p>youth.  He went back to visit the stream a few years since, and it</p>
<p>was gone, literally vanished from the face of earth, stolen to make</p>
<p>a watersupply for the town, and used for such base purposes as the</p>
<p>washing of clothes and the sprinkling of streets.</p>
<p>I remember an expedition with my father, some twenty years ago, to</p>
<p>Nova Scotia, whither we set out to realize the hopes kindled by an</p>
<p>ANGLER&#x27;S GUIDE written in the early sixties.  It was like looking</p>
<p>for tall clocks in the farmhouses around Boston.  The harvest had</p>
<p>been well gleaned before our arrival, and in the very place where</p>
<p>our visionary author located his most famous catch we found a summer</p>
<p>hotel and a sawmill.</p>
<p>&#x27;T is strange and sad, how many regions there are where &quot;the fishing</p>
<p>was wonderful forty years ago&quot;!</p>
<p>The second class of angling books--the literature of power--includes</p>
<p>all (even those written with some purpose of instruction) in which</p>
<p>the gentle fascinations of the sport, the attractions of living out-</p>
<p>of-doors, the beauties of stream and woodland, the recollections of</p>
<p>happy adventure, and the cheerful thoughts that make the best of a</p>
<p>day&#x27;s luck, come clearly before the author&#x27;s mind and find some fit</p>
<p>expression in his words.  Of such books, thank Heaven, there is a</p>
<p>plenty to bring a Maytide charm and cheer into the fisherman&#x27;s dull</p>
<p>December.  I will name, by way of random tribute from a grateful but</p>
<p>unmethodical memory, a few of these consolatory volumes.</p>
<p>First of all comes a family of books that were born in Scotland and</p>
<p>smell of the heather.</p>
<p>Whatever a Scotchman&#x27;s conscience permits him to do, is likely to be</p>
<p>done with vigour and a fiery mind.  In trade and in theology, in</p>
<p>fishing and in fighting, he is all there and thoroughly kindled.</p>
<p>There is an old-fashioned book called THE MOOR AND THE LOCH, by John</p>
<p>Colquhoun, which is full of contagious enthusiasm.  Thomas Tod</p>
<p>Stoddart was a most impassioned angler, (though over-given to strong</p>
<p>language,) and in his ANGLING REMINISCENCES he has touched the</p>
<p>subject with a happy hand,--happiest when he breaks into poetry and</p>
<p>tosses out a song for the fisherman.  Professor John Wilson of the</p>
<p>University of Edinburgh held the chair of Moral Philosophy in that</p>
<p>institution, but his true fame rests on his well-earned titles of A.</p>
<p>M. and F. R. S.,--Master of Angling, and Fisherman Royal of</p>
<p>Scotland.  His RECREATIONS OF CHRISTOPHER NORTH, albeit their humour</p>
<p>is sometimes too boisterously hammered in, are genial and generous</p>
<p>essays, overflowing with passages of good-fellowship and pedestrian</p>
<p>fancy.  I would recommend any person in a dry and melancholy state</p>
<p>of mind to read his paper on &quot;Streams,&quot; in the first volume of</p>
<p>ESSAYS CRITICAL AND IMAGINATIVE.  But it must be said, by way of</p>
<p>warning to those with whom dryness is a matter of principle, that</p>
<p>all Scotch fishing-books are likely to be sprinkled with Highland</p>
<p>Dew.</p>
<p>Among English anglers, Sir Humphry Davy is one of whom Christopher</p>
<p>North speaks rather slightingly.  Nevertheless his SALMONIA is well</p>
<p>worth reading, not only because it was written by a learned man, but</p>
<p>because it exhales the spirit of cheerful piety and vital wisdom.</p>
<p>Charles Kingsley was another great man who wrote well about angling.</p>
<p>His CHALK-STREAM STUDIES are clear and sparkling.  They cleanse the</p>
<p>mind and refresh the heart and put us more in love with living.  Of</p>
<p>quite a different style are the MAXIMS AND HINTS FOR AN ANGLER, AND</p>
<p>MISERIES OF FISHING, which were written by Richard Penn, a grandson</p>
<p>of the founder of Pennsylvania.  This is a curious and rare little</p>
<p>volume, professing to be a compilation from the &quot;Common Place Book</p>
<p>of the Houghton Fishing Club,&quot; and dealing with the subject from a</p>
<p>Pickwickian point of view.  I suppose that William Penn would have</p>
<p>thought his grandson a frivolous writer.</p>
<p>But he could not have entertained such an opinion of the Honourable</p>
<p>Robert Boyle, of whose OCCASIONAL REFLECTIONS no less than twelve</p>
<p>discourses treat &quot;of Angling Improved to Spiritual Uses.&quot;  The</p>
<p>titles of some of these discourses are quaint enough to quote.</p>
<p>&quot;Upon the being called upon to rise early on a very fair morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Upon the mounting, singing, and lighting of larks.&quot;  &quot;Upon fishing</p>
<p>with a counterfeit fly.&quot;  &quot;Upon a danger arising from an</p>
<p>unseasonable contest with the steersman.&quot;  &quot;Upon one&#x27;s drinking</p>
<p>water out of the brim of his hat.&quot;  With such good texts it is easy</p>
<p>to endure, and easier still to spare, the sermons.</p>
<p>Englishmen carry their love of travel into their anglimania, and</p>
<p>many of their books describe fishing adventures in foreign parts.</p>
<p>RAMBLES WITH A FISHING-ROD, by E. S. Roscoe, tells of happy days in</p>
<p>the Salzkammergut and the Bavarian Highlands and Normandy.  FISH-</p>
<p>TAILS AND A FEW OTHERS, by Bradnock Hall, contains some delightful</p>
<p>chapters on Norway.  THE ROD IN INDIA, by H. S. Thomas, narrates</p>
<p>wonderful adventures with the Mahseer and the Rohu and other pagan</p>
<p>fish.</p>
<p>But, after all, I like the English angler best when he travels at</p>
<p>home, and writes of dry-fly fishing in the Itchen or the Test, or of</p>
<p>wet-fly fishing in Northumberland or Sutherlandshire.  There is a</p>
<p>fascinating booklet that appeared quietly, some years ago, called AN</p>
<p>AMATEUR ANGLER&#x27;S DAYS IN DOVE DALE.  It runs as easily and merrily</p>
<p>and kindly as a little river, full of peace and pure enjoyment.</p>
<p>Other books of the same quality have since been written by the same</p>
<p>pen,--DAYS IN CLOVER, FRESH WOODS, BY MEADOW AND STREAM.  It is no</p>
<p>secret, I believe, that the author is Mr. Edward Marston, the senior</p>
<p>member of a London publishing-house.  But he still clings to his</p>
<p>retiring pen-name of &quot;The Amateur Angler,&quot; and represents himself,</p>
<p>by a graceful fiction, as all unskilled in the art.  An instance of</p>
<p>similar modesty is found in Mr. Andrew Lang, who entitles the first</p>
<p>chapter of his delightful ANGLING SKETCHES (without which no</p>
<p>fisherman&#x27;s library is complete), &quot;Confessions of a Duffer.&quot;  This</p>
<p>an engaging liberty which no one else would dare to take.</p>
<p>The best English fish-story pure and simple, that I know, is</p>
<p>&quot;Crocker&#x27;s Hole,&quot; by H. D. Black-more, the creator of LORNA DOONE.</p>
<p>Let us turn now to American books about angling.  Of these the</p>
<p>merciful dispensations of Providence have brought forth no small</p>
<p>store since Mr. William Andrew Chatto made the ill-natured remark</p>
<p>which is pilloried at the head of this chapter.  By the way, it</p>
<p>seems that Mr. Chatto had never heard of &quot;The Schuylkill Fishing</p>
<p>Company,&quot; which was founded on that romantic stream near</p>
<p>Philadelphia in 1732, nor seen the AUTHENTIC HISTORICAL MEMOIR of</p>
<p>that celebrated and amusing society.</p>
<p>I am sorry for the man who cannot find pleasure in reading the</p>
<p>appendix of THE AMERICAN ANGLER&#x27;S BOOK, by Thaddeus Norris; or the</p>
<p>discursive pages of Frank Forester&#x27;s FISH AND FISHING; or the</p>
<p>introduction and notes of that unexcelled edition of Walton which</p>
<p>was made by the Reverend Doctor George W. Bethune; or SUPERIOR</p>
<p>FISHING and GAME FISH OF THE NORTH, by Mr. Robert B. Roosevelt; or</p>
<p>Henshall&#x27;s BOOK OF THE BLACK BASS; or the admirable disgressions of</p>
<p>Mr. Henry P. Wells, in his FLY-RODS AND FLY-TACKLE, and THE AMERICAN</p>
<p>SALMON ANGLER.  Dr. William C. Prime has never put his profound</p>
<p>knowledge of the art of angling into a manual of technical</p>
<p>instruction; but he has written of the delights of the sport in OWL</p>
<p>CREEK LETTERS, and in I GO A-FISHING, and in some of the chapters of</p>
<p>ALONG NEW ENGLAND ROADS and AMONG NEW ENGLAND HILLS, with a</p>
<p>persuasive skill that has created many new anglers, and made many</p>
<p>old ones grateful.  It is a fitting coincidence of heredity that his</p>
<p>niece, Mrs. Annie Trumbull Slosson, is the author of the most tender</p>
<p>and pathetic of all angling stories, FISHIN&#x27; JIMMY.</p>
<p>But it is not only in books written altogether from his peculiar</p>
<p>point of view and to humour his harmless insanity, that the angler</p>
<p>may find pleasant reading about his favourite pastime.  There are</p>
<p>excellent bits of fishing scattered all through the field of good</p>
<p>literature.  It seems as if almost all the men who could write well</p>
<p>had a friendly feeling for the contemplative sport.</p>
<p>Plutarch, in THE LIVES OF THE NOBLE GRECIANS AND ROMANS, tells a</p>
<p>capital fish-story of the manner in which the Egyptian Cleopatra</p>
<p>fooled that far-famed Roman wight, Marc Antony, when they were</p>
<p>angling together on the Nile.  As I recall it, from a perusal in</p>
<p>early boyhood, Antony was having very bad luck indeed; in fact he</p>
<p>had taken nothing, and was sadly put out about it.  Cleopatra,</p>
<p>thinking to get a rise out of him, secretly told one of her</p>
<p>attendants to dive over the opposite side of the barge and fasten a</p>
<p>salt fish to the Roman general&#x27;s hook.  The attendant was much</p>
<p>pleased with this commission, and, having executed it, proceeded to</p>
<p>add a fine stroke of his own; for when he had made the fish fast on</p>
<p>the hook, he gave a great pull to the line and held on tightly.</p>
<p>Antony was much excited and began to haul violently at his tackle.</p>
<p>&quot;By Jupiter!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;it was long in coming, but I have a</p>
<p>colossal bite now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have a care,&quot; said Cleopatra, laughing behind her sunshade, &quot;or he</p>
<p>will drag you into the water.  You must give him line when he pulls</p>
<p>hard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a denarius will I give!&quot; rudely responded Antony.  &quot;I mean to</p>
<p>have this halibut or Hades!&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment the man under the boat, being out of breath, let the</p>
<p>line go, and Antony, falling backward, drew up the salted herring.</p>
<p>&quot;Take that fish off the hook, Palinurus,&quot; he proudly said.  &quot;It is</p>
<p>not as large as I thought, but it looks like the oldest one that has</p>
<p>been caught to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>Such, in effect, is the tale narrated by the veracious Plutarch.</p>
<p>And if any careful critic wishes to verify my quotation from memory,</p>
<p>he may compare it with the proper page of Langhorne&#x27;s translation; I</p>
<p>think it is in the second volume, near the end.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott, who once described himself as</p>

<p>has an amusing passage of angling in the third chapter of</p>
<p>REDGAUNTLET.  Darsie Latimer is relating his adventures in</p>
<p>Dumfriesshire.  &quot;By the way,&quot; says he, &quot;old Cotton&#x27;s instructions,</p>
<p>by which I hoped to qualify myself for the gentle society of</p>
<p>anglers, are not worth a farthing for this meridian.  I learned this</p>
<p>by mere accident, after I had waited four mortal hours.  I shall</p>
<p>never forget an impudent urchin, a cowherd, about twelve years old,</p>
<p>without either brogue or bonnet, barelegged, with a very indifferent</p>
<p>pair of breeches,--how the villain grinned in scorn at my landing-</p>
<p>net, my plummet, and the gorgeous jury of flies which I had</p>
<p>assembled to destroy all the fish in the river.  I was induced at</p>
<p>last to lend the rod to the sneering scoundrel, to see what he would</p>
<p>make of it; and he not only half-filled my basket in an hour, but</p>
<p>literally taught me to kill two trouts with my own hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus ancient and well-authenticated is the superstition of the</p>
<p>angling powers of the barefooted country-boy,--in fiction.</p>
<p>Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, in that valuable but over-capitalized</p>
<p>book, MY NOVEL, makes use of Fishing for Allegorical Purposes.  The</p>
<p>episode of John Burley and the One-eyed Perch not only points a</p>
<p>Moral but adorns the Tale.</p>
<p>In the works of R. D. Blackmore, angling plays a less instructive</p>
<p>but a pleasanter part.  It is closely interwoven with love.  There</p>
<p>is a magical description of trout-fishing on a meadow-brook in ALICE</p>
<p>LORRAINE.  And who that has read LORNA DOONE, (pity for the man or</p>
<p>woman that knows not the delight of that book!) can ever forget how</p>
<p>young John Ridd dared his way up the gliddery water-slide, after</p>
<p>loaches, and found Lorna in a fair green meadow adorned with</p>
<p>flowers, at the top of the brook?</p>
<p>I made a little journey into the Doone Country once, just to see</p>
<p>that brook and to fish in it.  The stream looked smaller, and the</p>
<p>water-slide less terrible, than they seemed in the book.  But it was</p>
<p>a mighty pretty place after all; and I suppose that even John Ridd,</p>
<p>when he came back to it in after years, found it shrunken a little.</p>
<p>All the streams were larger in our boyhood than they are now,</p>
<p>except, perhaps, that which flows from the sweetest spring of all,</p>
<p>the fountain of love, which John Ridd discovered beside the</p>
<p>Bagworthy River,--and I, on the willow-shaded banks of the Patapsco,</p>
<p>where the Baltimore girls fish for gudgeons,--and you?  Come, gentle</p>
<p>reader, is there no stream whose name is musical to you, because of</p>
<p>a hidden spring of love that you once found on its shore?  The</p>
<p>waters of that fountain never fail, and in them alone we taste the</p>
<p>undiminished fulness of immortal youth.</p>
<p>The stories of William Black are enlivened with fish, and he knew,</p>
<p>better than most men, how they should be taken.  Whenever he wanted</p>
<p>to get two young people engaged to each other, all other devices</p>
<p>failing, he sent them out to angle together.  If it had not been for</p>
<p>fishing, everything in A PRINCESS OF THULE and WHITE HEATHER would</p>
<p>have gone wrong.</p>
<p>But even men who have been disappointed in love may angle for solace</p>
<p>or diversion.  I have known some old bachelors who fished</p>
<p>excellently well; and others I have known who could find, and give,</p>
<p>much pleasure in a day on the stream, though they had no skill in</p>
<p>the sport.  Of this class was Washington Irving, with an extract</p>
<p>from whose SKETCH BOOK I will bring this rambling dissertation to an</p>
<p>end.</p>
<p>&quot;Our first essay,&quot; says he, was along a mountain brook among the</p>
<p>highlands of the Hudson; a most unfortunate place for the execution</p>
<p>of those piscatory tactics which had been invented along the velvet</p>
<p>margins of quiet English rivulets.  It was one of those wild streams</p>
<p>that lavish, among our romantic solitudes, unheeded beauties enough</p>
<p>to fill the sketch-book of a hunter of the picturesque.  Sometimes</p>
<p>it would leap down rocky shelves, making small cascades, over which</p>
<p>the trees threw their broad balancing sprays, and long nameless</p>
<p>weeds hung in fringes from the impending banks, dripping with</p>
<p>diamond drops.  Sometimes it would brawl and fret along a ravine in</p>
<p>the matted shade of a forest, filling it with murmurs; and, after</p>
<p>this termagant career, would steal forth into open day, with the</p>
<p>most placid, demure face imaginable; as I have seen some pestilent</p>
<p>shrew of a housewife, after filling her home with uproar and ill-</p>
<p>humour, come dimpling out of doors, swimming and courtesying, and</p>
<p>smiling upon all the world.</p>
<p>&quot;How smoothly would this vagrant brook glide, at such times, through</p>
<p>some bosom of green meadow-land among the mountains, where the quiet</p>
<p>was only interrupted by the occasional tinkling of a bell from the</p>
<p>lazy cattle among the clover, or the sound of a woodcutter&#x27;s axe</p>
<p>from the neighbouring forest!</p>
<p>&quot;For my part, I was always a bungler at all kinds of sport that</p>
<p>required either patience or adroitness, and had not angled above</p>
<p>half an hour before I had completely &#x27;satisfied the sentiment,&#x27; and</p>
<p>convinced myself of the truth of Izaak Walton&#x27;s opinion, that</p>
<p>angling is something like poetry,--a man must be born to it.  I</p>
<p>hooked myself instead of the fish; tangled my line in every tree;</p>
<p>lost my bait; broke my rod; until I gave up the attempt in despair,</p>
<p>and passed the day under the trees, reading old Izaak, satisfied</p>
<p>that it was his fascinating vein of honest simplicity and rural</p>
<p>feeling that had bewitched me, and not the passion for angling.&quot;</p>
<p>A NORWEGIAN HONEYMOON</p>
<p>&quot;The best rose-bush, after all, is not that which has the fewest</p>
<p>thorns, but that which bears the finest roses.&quot;--SOLOMON SINGLEWITZ:</p>
<p>The Life of Adam.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>It was not all unadulterated sweetness, of course.  There were</p>
<p>enough difficulties in the way to make it seem desirable; and a few</p>
<p>stings of annoyance, now and then, lent piquancy to the adventure.</p>
<p>But a good memory, in dealing with the past, has the art of</p>
<p>straining out all the beeswax of discomfort, and storing up little</p>
<p>jars of pure hydromel.  As we look back at our six weeks in Norway,</p>
<p>we agree that no period of our partnership in experimental</p>
<p>honeymooning has yielded more honey to the same amount of comb.</p>
<p>Several considerations led us to the resolve of taking our honeymoon</p>
<p>experimentally rather than chronologically.  We started from the</p>
<p>self-evident proposition that it ought to be the happiest time in</p>
<p>married life.</p>
<p>&quot;It is perfectly ridiculous,&quot; said my lady Graygown, &quot;to suppose</p>
<p>that a thing like that can be fixed by the calendar.  It may</p>
<p>possibly fall in the first month after the wedding, but it is not</p>
<p>likely.  Just think how slightly two people know each other when</p>
<p>they get married.  They are in love, of course, but that is not at</p>
<p>all the same as being well acquainted.  Sometimes the more love, the</p>
<p>less acquaintance!  And sometimes the more acquaintance, the less</p>
<p>love!  Besides, at first there are always the notes of thanks for</p>
<p>the wedding-presents to be written, and the letters of</p>
<p>congratulation to be answered, and it is awfully hard to make each</p>
<p>one sound a little different from the others and perfectly natural.</p>
<p>Then, you know, everybody seems to suspect you of the folly of being</p>
<p>newly married.  You run across your friends everywhere, and they</p>
<p>grin when they see you.  You can&#x27;t help feeling as if a lot of</p>
<p>people were watching you through opera-glasses, or taking snap-shots</p>
<p>at you with a kodak.  It is absurd to imagine that the first month</p>
<p>must be the real honeymoon.  And just suppose it were,--what bad</p>
<p>luck that would be!  What would there be to look forward to?&quot;</p>
<p>Every word that fell from her lips seemed to me like the wisdom of</p>
<p>Diotima.</p>
<p>&quot;You are right,&quot; I cried; &quot;Portia could not hold a candle to you for</p>
<p>clear argument.  Besides, suppose two people are imprudent enough to</p>
<p>get married in the first week of December, as we did!--what becomes</p>
<p>of the chronological honeymoon then?  There is no fishing in</p>
<p>December, and all the rivers of Paradise, at least in our latitude,</p>
<p>are frozen up.  No, my lady, we will discover our month of honey by</p>
<p>the empirical method.  Each year we will set out together to seek it</p>
<p>in a solitude for two; and we will compare notes on moons, and</p>
<p>strike the final balance when we are sure that our happiest</p>
<p>experiment has been completed.&quot;</p>
<p>We are not sure of that, even yet.  We are still engaged, as a</p>
<p>committee of two, in our philosophical investigation, and we decline</p>
<p>to make anything but a report of progress.  We know more now than we</p>
<p>did when we first went honeymooning in the city of Washington.  For</p>
<p>one thing, we are certain that not even the far-famed rosemary-</p>
<p>fields of Narbonne, or the fragrant hillsides of the Corbieres,</p>
<p>yield a sweeter harvest to the busy-ness of the bees than the</p>
<p>Norwegian meadows and mountain-slopes yielded to our idleness in the</p>
<p>summer of 1888.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>The rural landscape of Norway, on the long easterly slope that leads</p>
<p>up to the watershed among the mountains of the western coast, is not</p>
<p>unlike that of Vermont or New Hampshire.  The railway from</p>
<p>Christiania to the Randsfjord carried us through a hilly country of</p>
<p>scattered farms and villages.  Wood played a prominent part in the</p>
<p>scenery.  There were dark stretches of forest on the hilltops and in</p>
<p>the valleys; rivers filled with floating logs; sawmills beside the</p>
<p>waterfalls; wooden farmhouses painted white; and rail-fences around</p>
<p>the fields.  The people seemed sturdy, prosperous, independent.</p>
<p>They had the familiar habit of coming down to the station to see the</p>
<p>train arrive and depart.  We might have fancied ourselves on a</p>
<p>journey through the Connecticut valley, if it had not been for the</p>
<p>soft sing-song of the Norwegian speech and the uniform politeness of</p>
<p>the railway officials.</p>
<p>What a room that was in the inn at Randsfjord where we spent our</p>
<p>first night out!  Vast, bare, primitive, with eight windows to admit</p>
<p>the persistent nocturnal twilight; a sea-like floor of blue-painted</p>
<p>boards, unbroken by a single island of carpet; and a castellated</p>
<p>stove in one corner: an apartment for giants, with two little beds</p>
<p>for dwarfs on opposite shores of the ocean.  There was no telephone;</p>
<p>so we arranged a system of communication with a fishing-line, to</p>
<p>make sure that the sleepy partner should be awake in time for the</p>
<p>early boat in the morning.</p>
<p>The journey up the lake took seven hours, and reminded us of a</p>
<p>voyage on Lake George; placid, picturesque, and pervaded by summer</p>
<p>boarders.  Somewhere on the way we had lunch, and were well</p>
<p>fortified to take the road when the steamboat landed us at Odnaes,</p>
<p>at the head of the lake, about two o&#x27;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>There are several methods in which you may drive through Norway.</p>
<p>The government maintains posting-stations at the farms along the</p>
<p>main travelled highways, where you can hire horses and carriages of</p>
<p>various kinds.  There are also English tourist agencies which make a</p>
<p>business of providing travellers with complete transportation.  You</p>
<p>may try either of these methods alone, or you may make a judicious</p>
<p>mixture.</p>
<p>Thus, by an application of the theory of permutations and</p>
<p>combinations, you have your choice among four ways of accomplishing</p>
<p>a driving-tour.  First, you may engage a carriage and pair, with a</p>
<p>driver, from one of the tourist agencies, and roll through your</p>
<p>journey in sedentary case, provided your horses do not go lame or</p>
<p>give out.  Second, you may rely altogether upon the posting-stations</p>
<p>to send you on your journey; and this is a very pleasant, lively</p>
<p>way, provided there is not a crowd of travellers on the road before</p>
<p>you, who take up all the comfortable conveyances and leave you</p>
<p>nothing but a jolting cart or a ramshackle KARIOL of the time of St.</p>
<p>Olaf.  Third, you may rent an easy-riding vehicle (by choice a well-</p>
<p>hung gig) for the entire trip, and change ponies at the stations as</p>
<p>you drive along; this is the safest way.  The fourth method is to</p>
<p>hire your horseflesh at the beginning for the whole journey, and</p>
<p>pick up your vehicles from place to place.  This method is</p>
<p>theoretically possible, but I do not know any one who has tried it.</p>
<p>Our gig was waiting for us at Odnaes.  There was a brisk little</p>
<p>mouse-coloured pony in the shafts; and it took but a moment to strap</p>
<p>our leather portmanteau on the board at the back, perch the postboy</p>
<p>on top of it, and set out for our first experience of a Norwegian</p>
<p>driving-tour.</p>
<p>The road at first was level and easy; and we bowled along smoothly</p>
<p>through the valley of the Etnaelv, among drooping birch-trees and</p>
<p>green fields where the larks were singing.  At Tomlevolden, ten</p>
<p>miles farther on, we reached the first station, a comfortable old</p>
<p>farmhouse, with a great array of wooden outbuildings.  Here we had a</p>
<p>chance to try our luck with the Norwegian language in demanding &quot;en</p>
<p>hest, saa straxt som muligt.&quot;  This was what the guide-book told us</p>
<p>to say when we wanted a horse.</p>
<p>There is great fun in making a random cast on the surface of a</p>
<p>strange language.  You cannot tell what will come up.  It is like an</p>
<p>experiment in witchcraft.  We should not have been at all surprised,</p>
<p>I must confess, if our preliminary incantation had brought forth a</p>
<p>cow or a basket of eggs.</p>
<p>But the good people seemed to divine our intentions; and while we</p>
<p>were waiting for one of the stable-boys to catch and harness the new</p>
<p>horse, a yellow-haired maiden inquired, in very fair English, if we</p>
<p>would not be pleased to have a cup of tea and some butter-bread;</p>
<p>which we did with great comfort.</p>
<p>The SKYDSGUT, or so-called postboy, for the next stage of the</p>
<p>journey, was a full-grown man of considerable weight.  As he climbed</p>
<p>to his perch on our portmanteau, my lady Graygown congratulated me</p>
<p>on the prudence which had provided that one side of that receptacle</p>
<p>should be of an inflexible stiffness, quite incapable of being</p>
<p>crushed; otherwise, asked she, what would have become of her Sunday</p>
<p>frock under the pressure of this stern necessity of a postboy?</p>
<p>But I think we should not have cared very much if all our luggage</p>
<p>had been smashed on this journey, for the road now began to ascend,</p>
<p>and the views over the Etnadal, with its winding river, were of a</p>
<p>breadth and sweetness most consoling.  Up and up we went, curving in</p>
<p>and out through the forest, crossing wild ravines and shadowy dells,</p>
<p>looking back at every turn on the wide landscape bathed in golden</p>
<p>light.  At the station of Sveen, where we changed horse and postboy</p>
<p>again, it was already evening.  The sun was down, but the mystical</p>
<p>radiance of the northern twilight illumined the sky.  The dark fir-</p>
<p>woods spread around us, and their odourous breath was diffused</p>
<p>through the cool, still air.  We were crossing the level summit of</p>
<p>the plateau, twenty-three hundred feet above the sea.  Two tiny</p>
<p>woodland lakes gleamed out among the trees.  Then the road began to</p>
<p>slope gently towards the west, and emerged suddenly on the edge of</p>
<p>the forest, looking out over the long, lovely vale of Valders, with</p>
<p>snow-touched mountains on the horizon, and the river Baegna</p>
<p>shimmering along its bed, a thousand feet below us.</p>
<p>What a heart-enlarging outlook!  What a keen joy of motion, as the</p>
<p>wheels rolled down the long incline, and the sure-footed pony swung</p>
<p>between the shafts and rattled his hoofs merrily on the hard road!</p>
<p>What long, deep breaths of silent pleasure in the crisp night air!</p>
<p>What wondrous mingling of lights in the afterglow of sunset, and the</p>
<p>primrose bloom of the first stars, and faint foregleamings of the</p>
<p>rising moon creeping over the hill behind us!  What perfection of</p>
<p>companionship without words, as we rode together through a strange</p>
<p>land, along the edge of the dark!</p>
<p>When we finished the thirty-fifth mile, and drew up in the courtyard</p>
<p>of the station at Frydenlund, Graygown sprang out, with a little</p>
<p>sigh of regret.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it last night,&quot; she cried, &quot;or to-morrow morning?  I have n&#x27;t</p>
<p>the least idea what time it is; it seems as if we had been</p>
<p>travelling in eternity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is just ten o&#x27;clock,&quot; I answered, &quot;and the landlord says there</p>
<p>will be a hot supper of trout ready for us in five minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>It would be vain to attempt to give a daily record of the whole</p>
<p>journey in which we made this fair beginning.  It was a most idle</p>
<p>and unsystematic pilgrimage.  We wandered up and down, and turned</p>
<p>aside when fancy beckoned.  Sometimes we hurried on as fast as the</p>
<p>horses would carry us, driving sixty or seventy miles a day;</p>
<p>sometimes we loitered and dawdled, as if we did not care whether we</p>
<p>got anywhere or not.  If a place pleased us, we stayed and tried the</p>
<p>fishing.  If we were tired of driving, we took to the water, and</p>
<p>travelled by steamer along a fjord, or hired a rowboat to cross from</p>
<p>point to point.  One day we would be in a good little hotel, with</p>
<p>polyglot guests, and serving-maids in stagey Norse costumes,--like</p>
<p>the famous inn at Stalheim, which commands the amazing panorama of</p>
<p>the Naerodal.  Another day we would lodge in a plain farmhouse like</p>
<p>the station at Nedre Vasenden, where eggs and fish were the staples</p>
<p>of diet, and the farmer&#x27;s daughter wore the picturesque peasants&#x27;</p>
<p>dress, with its tall cap, without any dramatic airs.  Lakes and</p>
<p>rivers, precipices and gorges, waterfalls and glaciers and snowy</p>
<p>mountains were our daily repast.  We drove over five hundred miles</p>
<p>in various kinds of open wagons, KARIOLS for one, and STOLKJAERRES</p>
<p>for two, after we had left our comfortable gig behind us.  We saw</p>
<p>the ancient dragon-gabled church of Burgund; and the delightful,</p>
<p>showery town of Bergen; and the gloomy cliffs of the Geiranger-Fjord</p>
<p>laced with filmy cataracts; and the bewitched crags of the Romsdal;</p>
<p>and the wide, desolate landscape of Jerkin; and a hundred other</p>
<p>unforgotten scenes.  Somehow or other we went, (around and about,</p>
<p>and up and down, now on wheels, and now on foot, and now in a boat,)</p>
<p>all the way from Christiania to Throndhjem.  My lady Graygown could</p>
<p>give you the exact itinerary, for she has been well brought up, and</p>
<p>always keeps a diary.  All I know is, that we set out from one city</p>
<p>and arrived at the other, and we gathered by the way a collection of</p>
<p>instantaneous photographs.  I am going to turn them over now, and</p>
<p>pick out a few of the clearest pictures.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Here is the bridge over the Naeselv at Fagernaes.  Just below it is</p>
<p>a good pool for trout, but the river is broad and deep and swift.</p>
<p>It is difficult wading to get out within reach of the fish.  I have</p>
<p>taken half a dozen small ones and come to the end of my cast.  There</p>
<p>is a big one lying out in the middle of the river, I am sure.  But</p>
<p>the water already rises to my hips; another step will bring it over</p>
<p>the top of my waders, and send me downstream feet uppermost.</p>
<p>&quot;Take care!&quot; cries Graygown from the grassy bank, where she sits</p>
<p>placidly crocheting some mysterious fabric of white yarn.</p>
<p>She does not see the large rock lying at the bottom of the river</p>
<p>just beyond me.  If I can step on that, and stand there without</p>
<p>being swept away, I can reach the mid-current with my flies.  It is</p>
<p>a long stride and a slippery foothold, but by good luck &quot;the last</p>
<p>step which costs&quot; is accomplished.  The tiny black and orange hackle</p>
<p>goes curling out over the stream, lights softly, and swings around</p>
<p>with the current, folding and expanding its feathers as if it were</p>
<p>alive.  The big trout takes it promptly the instant it passes over</p>
<p>him; and I play him and net him without moving from my perilous</p>
<p>perch.</p>
<p>Graygown waves her crochet-work like a flag, &quot;Bravo!&quot; she cries.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s a beauty, nearly two pounds!  But do be careful about coming</p>
<p>back; you are not good enough to take any risks yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The station at Skogstad is a solitary farmhouse lying far up on the</p>
<p>bare hillside, with its barns and out-buildings grouped around a</p>
<p>central courtyard, like a rude fortress.  The river travels along</p>
<p>the valley below, now wrestling its way through a narrow passage</p>
<p>among the rocks, now spreading out at leisure in a green meadow.  As</p>
<p>we cross the bridge, the crystal water is changed to opal by the</p>
<p>sunset glow, and a gentle breeze ruffles the long pools, and the</p>
<p>trout are rising freely.  It is the perfect hour for fishing.  Would</p>
<p>Graygown dare to drive on alone to the gate of the fortress, and</p>
<p>blow upon the long horn which doubtless hangs beside it, and demand</p>
<p>admittance and a lodging, &quot;in the name of the great Jehovah and the</p>
<p>Continental Congress,&quot;--while I angle down the river a mile or so?</p>
<p>Certainly she would.  What door is there in Europe at which the</p>
<p>American girl is afraid to knock?  &quot;But wait a moment.  How do you</p>
<p>ask for fried chicken and pancakes in Norwegian?  KYLLING OG</p>
<p>PANDEKAGE?  How fierce it sounds!  All right now.  Run along and</p>
<p>fish.&quot;</p>
<p>The river welcomes me like an old friend.  The tune that it sings is</p>
<p>the same that the flowing water repeats all around the world.  Not</p>
<p>otherwise do the lively rapids carry the familiar air, and the</p>
<p>larger falls drone out a burly bass, along the west branch of the</p>
<p>Penobscot, or down the valley of the Bouquet.  But here there are no</p>
<p>forests to conceal the course of the stream.  It lies as free to the</p>
<p>view as a child&#x27;s thought.  As I follow on from pool to pool,</p>
<p>picking out a good trout here and there, now from a rocky corner</p>
<p>edged with foam, now from a swift gravelly run, now from a snug</p>
<p>hiding-place that the current has hollowed out beneath the bank, all</p>
<p>the way I can see the fortress far above me on the hillside.</p>
<p>I am as sure that it has already surrendered to Graygown as if I</p>
<p>could discern her white banner of crochet-work floating from the</p>
<p>battlements.</p>
<p>Just before dark, I climb the hill with a heavy basket of fish.  The</p>
<p>castle gate is open.  The scent of chicken and pancakes salutes the</p>
<p>weary pilgrim.  In a cosy little parlour, adorned with fluffy mats</p>
<p>and pictures framed in pine-cones, lit by a hanging lamp with glass</p>
<p>pendants, sits the mistress of the occasion, calmly triumphant and</p>
<p>plying her crochet-needle.</p>
<p>There is something mysterious about a woman&#x27;s fancy-work.  It seems</p>
<p>to have all the soothing charm of the tobacco-plant, without its</p>
<p>inconveniences.  Just to see her tranquillity, while she relaxes her</p>
<p>mind and busies her fingers with a bit of tatting or embroidery or</p>
<p>crochet, gives me a sense of being domesticated, a &quot;homey&quot; feeling,</p>
<p>anywhere in the wide world.</p>
<p>If you ever go to Norway, you must be sure to see the Loenvand.  You</p>
<p>can set out from the comfortable hotel at Faleide, go up the Indvik</p>
<p>Fjord in a rowboat, cross over a two-mile hill on foot or by</p>
<p>carriage, spend a happy day on the lake, and return to your inn in</p>
<p>time for a late supper.  The lake is perhaps the most beautiful in</p>
<p>Norway.  Long and narrow, it lies like a priceless emerald of palest</p>
<p>green, hidden and guarded by jealous mountains.  It is fed by huge</p>
<p>glaciers, which hang over the shoulders of the hills like ragged</p>
<p>cloaks of ice.</p>
<p>As we row along the shore, trolling in vain for the trout that live</p>
<p>in the ice-cold water, fragments of the tattered cloth-of-silver far</p>
<p>above us, on the opposite side, are loosened by the touch of the</p>
<p>summer sun, and fall from the precipice.  They drift downward, at</p>
<p>first, as noiselessly as thistledowns; then they strike the rocks</p>
<p>and come crashing towards the lake with the hollow roar of an</p>
<p>avalanche.</p>
<p>At the head of the lake we find ourselves in an enormous</p>
<p>amphitheatre of mountains.  Glaciers are peering down upon us.</p>
<p>Snow-fields glare at us with glistening eyes.  Black crags seem to</p>
<p>bend above us with an eternal frown.  Streamers of foam float from</p>
<p>the forehead of the hills and the lips of the dark ravines.  But</p>
<p>there is a little river of cold, pure water flowing from one of the</p>
<p>rivers of ice, and a pleasant shelter of young trees and bushes</p>
<p>growing among the debris of shattered rocks; and there we build our</p>
<p>camp-fire and eat our lunch.</p>
<p>Hunger is a most impudent appetite.  It makes a man forget all the</p>
<p>proprieties.  What place is there so lofty, so awful, that he will</p>
<p>not dare to sit down in it and partake of food?  Even on the side of</p>
<p>Mount Sinai, the elders of Israel spread their out-of-door table,</p>
<p>&quot;and did eat and drink.&quot;</p>
<p>I see the Tarn of the Elk at this moment, just as it looked in the</p>
<p>clear sunlight of that August afternoon, ten years ago.  Far down in</p>
<p>a hollow of the desolate hills it nestles, four thousand feet above</p>
<p>the sea.  The moorland trail hangs high above it, and, though it is</p>
<p>a mile away, every curve of the treeless shore, every shoal and reef</p>
<p>in the light green water is clearly visible.  With a powerful field-</p>
<p>glass one can almost see the large trout for which the pond is</p>
<p>famous.</p>
<p>The shelter-hut on the bank is built of rough gray stones, and the</p>
<p>roof is leaky to the light as well as to the weather.  But there are</p>
<p>two beds in it, one for my guide and one for me; and a practicable</p>
<p>fireplace, which is soon filled with a blaze of comfort.  There is</p>
<p>also a random library of novels, which former fishermen have</p>
<p>thoughtfully left behind them.  I like strong reading in the</p>
<p>wilderness.  Give me a story with plenty of danger and wholesome</p>
<p>fighting in it,--&quot;The Three Musketeers,&quot; or &quot;Treasure Island,&quot; or</p>
<p>&quot;The Afghan&#x27;s Knife.&quot;  Intricate studies of social dilemmas and</p>
<p>tales of mild philandering seem bloodless and insipid.</p>
<p>The trout in the Tarn of the Elk are large, undoubtedly, but they</p>
<p>are also few in number and shy in disposition.  Either some of the</p>
<p>peasants have been fishing over them with the deadly &quot;otter,&quot; or</p>
<p>else they belong to that variety of the trout family known as TRUTTA</p>
<p>DAMNOSA,--the species which you can see but cannot take.  We watched</p>
<p>these aggravating fish playing on the surface at sunset; we saw them</p>
<p>dart beneath our boat in the early morning; but not until a driving</p>
<p>snowstorm set in, about noon of the second day, did we succeed in</p>
<p>persuading any of them to take the fly.  Then they rose, for a</p>
<p>couple of hours, with amiable perversity.  I caught five, weighing</p>
<p>between two and four pounds each, and stopped because my hands were</p>
<p>so numb that I could cast no longer.</p>
<p>Now for a long tramp over the hills and home.  Yes, home; for yonder</p>
<p>in the white house at Drivstuen, with fuchsias and geraniums</p>
<p>blooming in the windows, and a pretty, friendly Norse girl to keep</p>
<p>her company, my lady is waiting for me.  See, she comes running out</p>
<p>to the door, in the gathering dusk, with a red flower in her hair,</p>
<p>and hails me with the fisherman&#x27;s greeting.  WHAT LUCK?</p>
<p>Well, THIS luck, at all events!  I can show you a few good fish, and</p>
<p>sit down with you to a supper of reindeer-venison and a quiet</p>
<p>evening of music and talk.</p>
<p>Shall I forget thee, hospitable Stuefloten, dearest to our memory of</p>
<p>all the rustic stations in Norway?  There are no stars beside thy</p>
<p>name in the pages of Baedeker.  But in the book of our hearts a</p>
<p>whole constellation is thine.</p>
<p>The long, low, white farmhouse stands on a green hill at the head of</p>
<p>the Romsdal.  A flourishing crop of grass and flowers grows on the</p>
<p>stable-roof, and there is a little belfry with a big bell to call</p>
<p>the labourers home from the fields.  In the corner of the living-</p>
<p>room of the old house there is a broad fireplace built across the</p>
<p>angle.  Curious cupboards are tucked away everywhere.  The long</p>
<p>table in the dining-room groans thrice a day with generous fare.</p>
<p>There are as many kinds of hot bread as in a Virginia country-house;</p>
<p>the cream is thick enough to make a spoon stand up in amazement;</p>
<p>once, at dinner, we sat embarrassed before six different varieties</p>
<p>of pudding.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the saffron light is beginning to fade, we go</p>
<p>out and walk in the road before the house, looking down the long</p>
<p>mystical vale of the Rauma, or up to the purple western hills from</p>
<p>which the clear streams of the Ulvaa flow to meet us.</p>
<p>Above Stuefloten the Rauma lingers and meanders through a smoother</p>
<p>and more open valley, with broad beds of gravel and flowery meadows.</p>
<p>Here the trout and grayling grow fat and lusty, and here we angle</p>
<p>for them, day after day, in water so crystalline that when one steps</p>
<p>into the stream one hardly knows whether to expect a depth of six</p>
<p>inches or six feet.</p>
<p>Tiny English flies and leaders of gossamer are the tackle for such</p>
<p>water in midsummer.  With this delicate outfit, and with a light</p>
<p>hand and a long line, one may easily outfish the native angler, and</p>
<p>fill a twelve-pound basket every fair day.  I remember an old</p>
<p>Norwegian, an inveterate fisherman, whose footmarks we saw ahead of</p>
<p>us on the stream all through an afternoon.  Footmarks I call them;</p>
<p>and so they were, literally, for there were only the prints of a</p>
<p>single foot to be seen on the banks of sand, and between them, a</p>
<p>series of small, round, deep holes.</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of a bird made those marks, Frederik?&quot; I asked my</p>
<p>faithful guide.</p>
<p>&quot;That is old Pedersen,&quot; he said, &quot;with his wooden leg.  He makes a</p>
<p>dot after every step.  We shall catch him in a little while.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, about six o&#x27;clock we saw him standing on a grassy</p>
<p>point, hurling his line, with a fat worm on the end of it, far</p>
<p>across the stream, and letting it drift down with the current.  But</p>
<p>the water was too fine for that style of fishing, and the poor old</p>
<p>fellow had but a half dozen little fish.  My creel was already</p>
<p>overflowing, so I emptied out all of the grayling into his bag, and</p>
<p>went on up the river to complete my tale of trout before dark.</p>
<p>And when the fishing is over, there is Graygown with the wagon,</p>
<p>waiting at the appointed place under the trees, beside the road.</p>
<p>The sturdy white pony trots gayly homeward.  The pale yellow stars</p>
<p>blossom out above the hills again, as they did on that first night</p>
<p>when we were driving down into the Valders.  Frederik leans over the</p>
<p>back of the seat, telling us marvellous tales, in his broken</p>
<p>English, of the fishing in a certain lake among the mountains, and</p>
<p>of the reindeer-shooting on the fjeld beyond it.</p>
<p>&quot;It is sad that you go to-morrow,&quot; says he &quot;but you come back</p>
<p>another year, I think, to fish in that lake, and to shoot those</p>
<p>reindeer.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, Frederik, we are coming back to Norway some day, perhaps,--who</p>
<p>can tell?  It is one of the hundred places that we are vaguely</p>
<p>planning to revisit.  For, though we did not see the midnight sun</p>
<p>there, we saw the honeymoon most distinctly.  And it was bright</p>
<p>enough to take pictures by its light.</p>
<p>WHO OWNS THE MOUNTAINS?</p>
<p>&quot;My heart is fixed firm and stable in the belief that ultimately</p>
<p>the sunshine and the summer, the flowers and the azure sky, shall</p>
<p>become, as it were, interwoven into man&#x27;s existence.  He shall take</p>
<p>from all their beauty and enjoy their glory.&quot;--RICHARD JEFFERIES:</p>
<p>The Life of the Fields.</p>
<p>It was the little lad that asked the question; and the answer also,</p>
<p>as you will see, was mainly his.</p>
<p>We had been keeping Sunday afternoon together in our favourite</p>
<p>fashion, following out that pleasant text which tells us to &quot;behold</p>
<p>the fowls of the air.&quot;  There is no injunction of Holy Writ less</p>
<p>burdensome in acceptance, or more profitable in obedience, than this</p>
<p>easy out-of-doors commandment.  For several hours we walked in the</p>
<p>way of this precept, through the untangled woods that lie behind the</p>
<p>Forest Hills Lodge, where a pair of pigeon-hawks had their nest; and</p>
<p>around the brambly shores of the small pond, where Maryland yellow-</p>
<p>throats and song-sparrows were settled; and under the lofty hemlocks</p>
<p>of the fragment of forest across the road, where rare warblers</p>
<p>flitted silently among the tree-tops.  The light beneath the</p>
<p>evergreens was growing dim as we came out from their shadow into the</p>
<p>widespread glow of the sunset, on the edge of a grassy hill,</p>
<p>overlooking the long valley of the Gale River, and uplooking to the</p>
<p>Franconia Mountains.</p>
<p>It was the benediction hour.  The placid air of the day shed a new</p>
<p>tranquillity over the consoling landscape.  The heart of the earth</p>
<p>seemed to taste a repose more perfect than that of common days.  A</p>
<p>hermit-thrush, far up the vale, sang his vesper hymn; while the</p>
<p>swallows, seeking their evening meal, circled above the river-fields</p>
<p>without an effort, twittering softly, now and then, as if they must</p>
<p>give thanks.  Slight and indefinable touches in the scene, perhaps</p>
<p>the mere absence of the tiny human figures passing along the road or</p>
<p>labouring in the distant meadows, perhaps the blue curls of smoke</p>
<p>rising lazily from the farmhouse chimneys, or the family groups</p>
<p>sitting under the maple-trees before the door, diffused a sabbath</p>
<p>atmosphere over the world.</p>
<p>Then said the lad, lying on the grass beside me, &quot;Father, who owns</p>
<p>the mountains?&quot;</p>
<p>I happened to have heard, the day before, of two or three lumber</p>
<p>companies that had bought</p>
<p>some of the woodland slopes; so I told him their names, adding that</p>
<p>there were probably a good many different owners, whose claims taken</p>
<p>all together would cover the whole Franconia range of hills.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; answered the lad, after a moment of silence, &quot;I don&#x27;t see</p>
<p>what difference that makes.  Everybody can look at them.&quot;</p>
<p>They lay stretched out before us in the level sunlight, the sharp</p>
<p>peaks outlined against the sky, the vast ridges of forest sinking</p>
<p>smoothly towards the valleys.  the deep hollows gathering purple</p>
<p>shadows in their bosoms, and the little foothills standing out in</p>
<p>rounded promontories of brighter green from the darker mass behind</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>Far to the east, the long comb of Twin Mountain extended itself back</p>
<p>into the untrodden wilderness.  Mount Garfield lifted a clear-cut</p>
<p>pyramid through the translucent air.  The huge bulk of Lafayette</p>
<p>ascended majestically in front of us, crowned with a rosy diadem of</p>
<p>rocks.  Eagle Cliff and Bald Mountain stretched their line of</p>
<p>scalloped peaks across the entrance to the Notch.  Beyond that</p>
<p>shadowy vale, the swelling summits of Cannon Mountain rolled away to</p>
<p>meet the tumbling waves of Kinsman, dominated by one loftier crested</p>
<p>billow that seemed almost ready to curl and break out of green</p>
<p>silence into snowy foam.  Far down the sleeping Landaff valley the</p>
<p>undulating dome of Moosilauke trembled in the distant blue.</p>
<p>They were all ours, from crested cliff to wooded base.  The solemn</p>
<p>groves of firs and spruces, the plumed sierras of lofty pines, the</p>
<p>stately pillared forests of birch and beech, the wild ravines, the</p>
<p>tremulous thickets of silvery poplar, the bare peaks with their wide</p>
<p>outlooks, and the cool vales resounding with the ceaseless song of</p>
<p>little rivers,--we knew and loved them all; they ministered peace</p>
<p>and joy to us; they were all ours, though we held no title deeds and</p>
<p>our ownership had never been recorded.</p>
<p>What is property, after all?  The law says there are two kinds, real</p>
<p>and personal.  But it seems to me that the only real property is</p>
<p>that which is truly personal, that which we take into our inner life</p>
<p>and make our own forever, by understanding and admiration and</p>
<p>sympathy and love.  This is the only kind of possession that is</p>
<p>worth anything.</p>
<p>A gallery of great paintings adorns the house of the Honourable</p>
<p>Midas Bond, and every year adds a new treasure to his collection.</p>
<p>He knows how much they cost him, and he keeps the run of the</p>
<p>quotations at the auction sales, congratulating himself as the price</p>
<p>of the works of his well-chosen artists rises in the scale, and the</p>
<p>value of his art treasures is enhanced.  But why should he call them</p>
<p>his?  He is only their custodian.  He keeps them well varnished, and</p>
<p>framed in gilt.  But he never passes through those gilded frames</p>
<p>into the world of beauty that lies behind the painted canvas.  He</p>
<p>knows nothing of those lovely places from which the artist&#x27;s soul</p>
<p>and hand have drawn their inspiration.  They are closed and barred</p>
<p>to him.  He has bought the pictures, but he cannot buy the key.  The</p>
<p>poor art student who wanders through his gallery, lingering with awe</p>
<p>and love before the masterpieces, owns them far more truly than</p>
<p>Midas does.</p>
<p>Pomposus Silverman purchased a rich library a few years ago.  The</p>
<p>books were rare and costly.  That was the reason why Pomposus bought</p>
<p>them.  He was proud to feel that he was the possessor of literary</p>
<p>treasures which were not to be found in the houses of his wealthiest</p>
<p>acquaintances.  But the threadbare Bucherfreund, who was engaged at</p>
<p>a slender salary to catalogue the library and take care of it,</p>
<p>became the real proprietor.  Pomposus paid for the books, but</p>
<p>Bucherfreund enjoyed them.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say that the possession of much money is always a</p>
<p>barrier to real wealth of mind and heart.  Nor would I maintain that</p>
<p>all the poor of this world are rich in faith and heirs of the</p>
<p>kingdom.  But some of them are.  And if some of the rich of this</p>
<p>world (through the grace of Him with whom all things are possible)</p>
<p>are also modest in their tastes, and gentle in their hearts, and</p>
<p>open in their minds, and ready to be pleased with unbought</p>
<p>pleasures, they simply share in the best things which are provided</p>
<p>for all.</p>
<p>I speak not now of the strife that men wage over the definition and</p>
<p>the laws of property.  Doubtless there is much here that needs to be</p>
<p>set right.  There are men and women in the world who are shut out</p>
<p>from the right to earn a living, so poor that they must perish for</p>
<p>want of daily bread, so full of misery that there is no room for the</p>
<p>tiniest seed of joy in their lives.  This is the lingering shame of</p>
<p>civilization.  Some day, perhaps, we shall find the way to banish</p>
<p>it.  Some day, every man shall have his title to a share in the</p>
<p>world&#x27;s great work and the world&#x27;s large joy.</p>
<p>But meantime it is certain that, where there are a hundred poor</p>
<p>bodies who suffer from physical privation, there are a thousand poor</p>
<p>souls who suffer from spiritual poverty.  To relive this greater</p>
<p>suffering there needs no change of laws, only a change of heart.</p>
<p>What does it profit a man to be the landed proprietor of countless</p>
<p>acres unless he can reap the harvest of delight that blooms from</p>
<p>every rood of God&#x27;s earth for the seeing eye and the loving spirit?</p>
<p>And who can reap that harvest so closely that there shall not be</p>
<p>abundant gleaning left for all mankind?  The most that a wide estate</p>
<p>can yield to its legal owner is a living.  But the real owner can</p>
<p>gather from a field of goldenrod, shining in the August sunlight, an</p>
<p>unearned increment of delight.</p>
<p>We measure success by accumulation.  The measure is false.  The true</p>
<p>measure is appreciation.  He who loves most has most.</p>
<p>How foolishly we train ourselves for the work of life!  We give our</p>
<p>most arduous and eager efforts to the cultivation of those faculties</p>
<p>which will serve us in the competitions of the forum and the market-</p>
<p>place.  But if we were wise, we should care infinitely more for the</p>
<p>unfolding of those inward, secret, spiritual powers by which alone</p>
<p>we can become the owners of anything that is worth having.  Surely</p>
<p>God is the great proprietor.  Yet all His works He has given away.</p>
<p>He holds no title-deeds.  The one thing that is His, is the perfect</p>
<p>understanding, the perfect joy, the perfect love, of all things that</p>
<p>He has made.  To a share in this high ownership He welcomes all who</p>
<p>are poor in spirit.  This is the earth which the meek inherit.  This</p>
<p>is the patrimony of the saints in light.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, laddie,&quot; I said to my comrade, &quot;let us go home.  You and I</p>
<p>are very rich.  We own the mountains.  But we can never sell them,</p>
<p>and we don&#x27;t want to.&quot;</p>
<p>A LAZY, IDLE BROOK</p>
<p>&quot;Perpetual devotion to what a man calls his business is only to be</p>
<p>sustained by perpetual neglect of many other things.  And it is not</p>
<p>by any means certain that a manÔøΩÔøΩs business is the most important</p>
<p>thing he has to do.&quot;--ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON: An Apology for Idlers.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>A CASUAL INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>On the South Shore of Long Island, all things incline to a natural</p>
<p>somnolence.  There are no ambitious mountains, no braggart cliffs,</p>
<p>no hasty torrents, no hustling waterfalls in that land,</p>
<p>&quot;In which it seemeth always afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>The salt meadows sleep in the summer sun; the farms and market-</p>
<p>gardens yield a placid harvest to a race of singularly unhurried</p>
<p>tillers of the soil; the low hills rise with gentle slopes, not</p>
<p>caring to get too high in the world, only far enough to catch a</p>
<p>pleasant glimpse of the sea and a breath of fresh air; the very</p>
<p>trees grow leisurely, as if they felt that they had &quot;all the time</p>
<p>there is.&quot; And from this dreamy land, close as it lies to the</p>
<p>unresting ocean, the tumult of the breakers and the foam of ever-</p>
<p>turning tides are shut off by the languid lagoons of the Great South</p>
<p>Bay and a long range of dunes, crested with wire-grass, bay-bushes,</p>
<p>and wild-roses.</p>
<p>In such a country you could not expect a little brook to be noisy,</p>
<p>fussy, energetic.  If it were not lazy, it would be out of keeping.</p>
<p>But the actual and undisguised idleness of this particular brook was</p>
<p>another affair, and one in which it was distinguished among its</p>
<p>fellows.  For almost all the other little rivers of the South Shore,</p>
<p>lazy as they may be by nature, yet manage to do some kind of work</p>
<p>before they finish the journey from their crystal-clear springs into</p>
<p>the brackish waters of the bay.  They turn the wheels of sleepy</p>
<p>gristmills, while the miller sits with his hands in his pockets</p>
<p>underneath the willow-trees.  They fill reservoirs out of which</p>
<p>great steam-engines pump the water to quench the thirst of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Even the smaller streams tarry long enough in their seaward</p>
<p>sauntering to irrigate a few cranberry-bogs and so provide that</p>
<p>savoury sauce which makes the Long Island turkey a fitter subject</p>
<p>for Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>But this brook of which I speak did none of these useful things.  It</p>
<p>was absolutely out of business.</p>
<p>There was not a mill, nor a reservoir, nor a cranberry-bog, on all</p>
<p>its course of a short mile.  The only profitable affair it ever</p>
<p>undertook was to fill a small ice-pond near its entrance into the</p>
<p>Great South Bay.  You could hardly call this a very energetic</p>
<p>enterprise.  It amounted to little more than a good-natured consent</p>
<p>to allow itself to be used by the winter for the making of ice, if</p>
<p>the winter happened to be cold enough.  Even this passive industry</p>
<p>came to nothing; for the water, being separated from the bay only by</p>
<p>a short tideway under a wooden bridge on the south country road, was</p>
<p>too brackish to freeze easily; and the ice, being pervaded with</p>
<p>weeds, was not much relished by the public.  So the wooden ice-</p>
<p>house, innocent of paint, and toned by the weather to a soft, sad-</p>
<p>coloured gray, stood like an improvised ruin among the pine-trees</p>
<p>beside the pond.</p>
<p>It was through this unharvested ice-pond, this fallow field of</p>
<p>water, that my lady Graygown and I entered on acquaintance with our</p>
<p>lazy, idle brook.  We had a house, that summer, a few miles down the</p>
<p>bay.  But it was a very small house, and the room that we like best</p>
<p>was out of doors.  So we spent much time in a sailboat,--by name</p>
<p>&quot;The Patience,&quot;--making voyages of exploration into watery corners</p>
<p>and byways.  Sailing past the wooden bridge one day, when a strong</p>
<p>east wind had made a very low tide, we observed the water flowing</p>
<p>out beneath the road with an eddying current.  We were interested to</p>
<p>discover where such a stream came from.  But the sailboat could not</p>
<p>go under the bridge, nor even make a landing on the shore without</p>
<p>risk of getting aground.  The next day we came back in a rowboat to</p>
<p>follow the clue of curiosity.  The tide was high now, and we passed</p>
<p>with the reversed current under the bridge, almost bumping our heads</p>
<p>against the timbers.  Emerging upon the pond, we rowed across its</p>
<p>shallow, weed-encumbered waters, and were introduced without</p>
<p>ceremony to one of the most agreeable brooks that we had ever met.</p>
<p>It was quite broad where it came into the pond,--a hundred feet from</p>
<p>side to side,--bordered with flags and rushes and feathery meadow</p>
<p>grasses.  The real channel meandered in sweeping curves from bank to</p>
<p>bank, and the water, except in the swifter current, was filled with</p>
<p>an amazing quantity of some aquatic moss.  The woods came straggling</p>
<p>down on either shore.  There were fallen trees in the stream here</p>
<p>and there.  On one of the points an old swamp-maple, with its</p>
<p>decrepit branches and its leaves already touched with the hectic</p>
<p>colours of decay, hung far out over the water which was undermining</p>
<p>it, looking and leaning downward, like an aged man who bends, half-</p>
<p>sadly and half-willingly, towards the grave.</p>
<p>But for the most part the brook lay wide open to the sky, and the</p>
<p>tide, rising and sinking somewhat irregularly in the pond below,</p>
<p>made curious alternations in its depth and in the swiftness of its</p>
<p>current.  For about half a mile we navigated this lazy little river,</p>
<p>and then we found that rowing would carry us no farther, for we came</p>
<p>to a place where the stream issued with a livelier flood from an</p>
<p>archway in a thicket.</p>
<p>This woodland portal was not more than four feet wide, and the</p>
<p>branches of the small trees were closely interwoven overhead.  We</p>
<p>shipped the oars and took one of them for a paddle.  Stooping down,</p>
<p>we pushed the boat through the archway and found ourselves in the</p>
<p>Fairy Dell.  It was a long, narrow bower, perhaps four hundred feet</p>
<p>from end to end, with the brook dancing through it in a joyous,</p>
<p>musical flow over a bed of clean yellow sand and white pebbles.</p>
<p>There were deep places in the curves where you could hardly touch</p>
<p>bottom with an oar, and shallow places in the straight runs where</p>
<p>the boat would barely float.  Not a ray of unbroken sunlight leaked</p>
<p>through the green roof of this winding corridor; and all along the</p>
<p>sides there were delicate mosses and tall ferns and wildwood flowers</p>
<p>that love the shade.</p>
<p>At the upper end of the bower our progress in the boat was barred by</p>
<p>a low bridge, on a forgotten road that wound through the pine-woods.</p>
<p>Here I left my lady Graygown, seated on the shady corner of the</p>
<p>bridge with a book, swinging her feet over the stream, while I set</p>
<p>out to explore its further course.  Above the wood-road there were</p>
<p>no more fairy dells, nor easy-going estuaries.  The water came down</p>
<p>through the most complicated piece of underbrush that I have ever</p>
<p>encountered.  Alders and swamp maples and pussy-willows and gray</p>
<p>birches grew together in a wild confusion.  Blackberry bushes and</p>
<p>fox-grapes and cat-briers trailed and twisted themselves anger.</p>
<p>What a pretty battle it is, and in a good cause, too!  Waste no pity</p>
<p>on that big black ruffian.  He is a villain and a thief, an egg-</p>
<p>stealer, an ogre, a devourer of unfledged innocents.  The kingbirds</p>
<p>are not afraid of him, knowing that he is a coward at heart.  They</p>
<p>fly upon him, now from below, now from above.  They buffet him from</p>
<p>one side and from the other.  They circle round him like a pair of</p>
<p>swift gunboats round an antiquated man-of-war.  They even perch upon</p>
<p>his back and dash their beaks into his neck and pluck feathers from</p>
<p>his piratical plumage.  At last his lumbering flight has carried him</p>
<p>far enough away, and the brave little defenders fly back to the</p>
<p>nest, poising above it on quivering wings for a moment, then dipping</p>
<p>down swiftly in pursuit of some passing insect.  The war is over.</p>
<p>Courage has had its turn.  Now tenderness comes into play.in an</p>
<p>incredible tangle.  There was only one way to advance, and that was</p>
<p>to wade in the middle of the brook, stooping low, lifting up the</p>
<p>pendulous alder-branches, threading a tortuous course, now under and</p>
<p>now over the innumerable obstacles, as a darning-needle is pushed in</p>
<p>and out through the yarn of a woollen stocking.</p>
<p>It was dark and lonely in that difficult passage.  The brook divided</p>
<p>into many channels, turning this way and that way, as if it were</p>
<p>lost in the woods.  There were huge clumps of OSMUNDA REGALIS</p>
<p>spreading their fronds in tropical profusion.  Mouldering logs were</p>
<p>covered with moss.  The water gurgled slowly into deep corners under</p>
<p>the banks.  Catbirds and blue jays fluttered screaming from the</p>
<p>thickets.  Cotton-tailed rabbits darted away, showing the white flag</p>
<p>of fear.  Once I thought I saw the fuscous gleam of a red fox</p>
<p>stealing silently through the brush.  It would have been no surprise</p>
<p>to hear the bark of a raccoon, or see the eyes of a wildcat gleaming</p>
<p>through the leaves.</p>
<p>For more than an hour I was pushing my way through this miniature</p>
<p>wilderness of half a mile; and then I emerged suddenly, to find</p>
<p>myself face to face with--a railroad embankment and the afternoon</p>
<p>express, with its parlour-cars, thundering down to Southampton!</p>
<p>It was a strange and startling contrast.  The explorerÔøΩÔøΩs joy, the</p>
<p>sense of adventure, the feeling of wildness and freedom, withered</p>
<p>and crumpled somewhat preposterously at the sight of the parlour-</p>
<p>cars.  My scratched hands and wet boots and torn coat seemed unkempt</p>
<p>and disreputable.  Perhaps some of the well-dressed people looking</p>
<p>out at the windows of the train were the friends with whom we were</p>
<p>to dine on Saturday.  BATECHE!  What would they say to such a</p>
<p>costume as mine?  What did I care what they said!</p>
<p>But, all the same, it was a shock, a disenchantment, to find that</p>
<p>civilization, with all its absurdities and conventionalities, was so</p>
<p>threateningly close to my new-found wilderness.  My first enthusiasm</p>
<p>was not a little chilled as I walked back, along an open woodland</p>
<p>path, to the bridge where Graygown was placidly reading.  Reading, I</p>
<p>say, though her book was closed, and her brown eyes were wandering</p>
<p>over the green leaves of the thicket, and the white clouds drifting,</p>
<p>drifting lazily across the blue deep of the sky.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>A BETTER ACQUAINTANCE</p>
<p>On the voyage home, she gently talked me out of my disappointment,</p>
<p>and into a wiser frame of mind.</p>
<p>It was a surprise, of course, she admitted, to find that our</p>
<p>wilderness was so little, and to discover the trail of a parlour-car</p>
<p>on the edge of Paradise.  But why not turn the surprise around, and</p>
<p>make it pleasant instead of disagreeable?  Why not look at the</p>
<p>contrast from the side that we liked best?</p>
<p>It was not necessary that everybody should take the same view of</p>
<p>life that pleased us.  The world would not get on very well without</p>
<p>people who preferred parlour-cars to canoes, and patent-leather</p>
<p>shoes to India-rubber boots, and ten-course dinners to picnics in</p>
<p>the woods.  These good people were unconsciously toiling at the hard</p>
<p>and necessary work of life in order that we, of the chosen and</p>
<p>fortunate few, should be at liberty to enjoy the best things in the</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>Why should we neglect our opportunities, which were also our real</p>
<p>duties?  The nervous disease of civilization might prevail all</p>
<p>around us, but that ought not to destroy our grateful enjoyment of</p>
<p>the lucid intervals that were granted to us by a merciful</p>
<p>Providence.</p>
<p>Why should we not take this little untamed brook, running its humble</p>
<p>course through the borders of civilized life and midway between two</p>
<p>flourishing summer resorts,--a brook without a single house or a</p>
<p>cultivated field on its banks, as free and beautiful and secluded as</p>
<p>if it flowed through miles of trackless forest,--why not take this</p>
<p>brook as a sign that the ordering of the universe had a &quot;good</p>
<p>intention&quot; even for inveterate idlers, and that the great Arranger</p>
<p>of the world felt some kindness for such gipsy-hearts as ours?  What</p>
<p>law, human or divine, was there to prevent us from making this</p>
<p>stream our symbol of deliverance from the conventional and</p>
<p>commonplace, our guide to liberty and a quiet mind?</p>
<p>So reasoned Graygown with her</p>

<p>And, according to her word, so did we.  That lazy, idle brook became</p>
<p>to us one of the best of friends; the pathfinder of happiness on</p>
<p>many a bright summer day; and, through long vacations, the faithful</p>
<p>encourager of indolence.</p>
<p>Indolence in the proper sense of the word, you understand.  The</p>
<p>meaning which is commonly given to it, as Archbishop Trench pointed</p>
<p>out in his suggestive book about WORDS AND THEIR USES, is altogether</p>
<p>false.  To speak of indolence as if it were a vice is just a great</p>
<p>big verbal slander.</p>
<p>Indolence is a virtue.  It comes from two Latin words, which mean</p>
<p>freedom from anxiety or grief.  And that is a wholesome state of</p>
<p>mind.  There are times and seasons when it is even a pious and</p>
<p>blessed state of mind.  Not to be in a hurry; not to be ambitious or</p>
<p>jealous or resentful; not to feel envious of anybody; not to fret</p>
<p>about to-day nor worry about to-morrow,--that is the way we ought</p>
<p>all to feel at some time in our lives; and that is the kind of</p>
<p>indolence in which our brook faithfully encouraged us.</p>
<p>ÔøΩÔøΩT is an age in which such encouragement is greatly needed.  We have</p>
<p>fallen so much into the habit of being always busy that we know not</p>
<p>how nor when to break it off with firmness.  Our business tags after</p>
<p>us into the midst of our pleasures, and we are ill at ease beyond</p>
<p>reach of the telegraph and the daily newspaper.  We agitate</p>
<p>ourselves amazingly about a multitude of affairs,--the politics of</p>
<p>Europe, the state of the weather all around the globe, the marriages</p>
<p>and festivities of very rich people, and the latest novelties in</p>
<p>crime, none of which are of vital interest to us.  The more earnest</p>
<p>souls among us are cultivating a vicious tendency to Summer Schools,</p>
<p>and Seaside Institutes of Philosophy, and Mountaintop Seminaries of</p>
<p>Modern Languages.</p>
<p>We toil assiduously to cram something more into those scrap-bags of</p>
<p>knowledge which we fondly call our minds.  Seldom do we rest</p>
<p>tranquil long enough to find out whether there is anything in them</p>
<p>already that is of real value,--any native feeling, any original</p>
<p>thought, which would like to come out and sun itself for a while in</p>
<p>quiet.</p>
<p>For my part, I am sure that I stand more in need of a deeper sense</p>
<p>of contentment with life than of a knowledge of the Bulgarian</p>
<p>tongue, and that all the paradoxes of Hegel would not do me so much</p>
<p>good as one hour of vital sympathy with the careless play of</p>
<p>children.  The Marquis du Paty de lÔøΩÔøΩHuitre may espouse the daughter</p>
<p>and heiress of the Honourable James Bulger with all imaginable pomp,</p>
<p>if he will.  CA NE MÔøΩÔøΩINTRIGUE POINT DU TOUT.  I would rather stretch</p>
<p>myself out on the grass and watch yonder pair of kingbirds carrying</p>
<p>luscious flies to their young ones in the nest, or chasing away the</p>
<p>marauding crow with shrill cries of   The</p>
<p>young birds, all ignorant of the passing danger, but always</p>
<p>conscious of an insatiable hunger, are uttering loud remonstrances</p>
<p>and plaintive demands for food.  Domestic life begins again, and</p>
<p>they that sow not, neither gather into barns, are fed.</p>
<p>Do you suppose that this wondrous stage of earth was set, and all</p>
<p>the myriad actors on it</p>
<p>taught to play their parts, without a spectator in view?  Do you</p>
<p>think that there is anything better for you and me to do, now and</p>
<p>then, than to sit down quietly in a humble seat, and watch a few</p>
<p>scenes in the drama?  Has it not something to say to us, and do we</p>
<p>not understand it best when we have a peaceful heart and free from</p>
<p>dolor?  That is what IN-DOLENCE means, and there are no better</p>
<p>teachers of it then the light-hearted birds and untoiling flowers,</p>
<p>commended by the wisest of all masters to our consideration; nor can</p>
<p>we find a more pleasant pedagogue to lead us to their school than a</p>
<p>small, merry brook.</p>
<p>And this was what our chosen stream did for us.  It was always</p>
<p>luring us away from an artificial life into restful companionship</p>
<p>with nature.</p>
<p>Suppose, for example, we found ourselves growing a bit dissatisfied</p>
<p>with the domestic arrangements of our little cottage, and coveting</p>
<p>the splendours of a grander establishment.  An afternoon on the</p>
<p>brook was a good cure for that folly.  Or suppose a day came when</p>
<p>there was an imminent prospect of many formal calls.  We had an</p>
<p>important engagement up the brook; and while we kept it we could</p>
<p>think with satisfaction of the joy of our callers when they</p>
<p>discovered that they could discharge their whole duty with a piece</p>
<p>of pasteboard.  This was an altruistic pleasure.  Or suppose that a</p>
<p>few friends were coming to supper, and there were no flowers for the</p>
<p>supper-table.  We could easily have bought them in the village.  But</p>
<p>it was far more to our liking to take the children up the brook, and</p>
<p>come back with great bunches of wild white honeysuckle and blue</p>
<p>flag, or posies of arrowheads and cardinal-flowers.  Or suppose that</p>
<p>I was very unwisely and reluctantly labouring at some serious piece</p>
<p>of literary work, promised for the next number of THE SCRIBBLERÔøΩÔøΩS</p>
<p>REVIEW; and suppose that in the midst of this labour the sad news</p>
<p>came to me that the fisherman had forgotten to leave any fish at our</p>
<p>cottage that morning.  Should my innocent babes and my devoted wife</p>
<p>be left to perish of starvation while I continued my poetical</p>
<p>comparison of the two Williams, Shakspeare and Watson?  Inhuman</p>
<p>selfishness!  Of course it was my plain duty to sacrifice my</p>
<p>inclinations, and get my fly-rod, and row away across the bay, with</p>
<p>a deceptive appearance of cheerfulness, to catch a basket of trout</p>
<p>in--</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>THE SECRETS OF INTIMACY</p>
<p>THERE!  I came within eight letters of telling the name of the</p>
<p>brook, a thing that I am firmly resolved not to do.  If it were an</p>
<p>ordinary fishless little river, or even a stream with nothing better</p>
<p>than grass-pike and sunfish in it, you should have the name and</p>
<p>welcome.  But when a brook contains speckled trout, and when their</p>
<p>presence is known to a very few persons who guard the secret as the</p>
<p>dragon guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides, and when the</p>
<p>size of the trout is large beyond the dreams of hope,--well, when</p>
<p>did you know a true angler who would willingly give away the name of</p>
<p>such a brook as that?  You may find an encourager of indolence in</p>
<p>almost any stream of the South Side, and I wish you joy of your</p>
<p>brook.  But if you want to catch trout in mine you must discover it</p>
<p>for yourself, or perhaps go with me some day, and solemnly swear</p>
<p>secrecy.</p>
<p>That was the way in which the freedom of the stream was conferred</p>
<p>upon me.  There was a small boy in the village, the son of rich but</p>
<p>respectable parents, and an inveterate all-round sportsman, aged</p>
<p>fourteen years, with whom I had formed a close intimacy.  I was</p>
<p>telling him about the pleasure of exploring the idle brook, and</p>
<p>expressing the opinion that in bygone days, (in that mythical &quot;forty</p>
<p>years ago&quot; when all fishing was good), there must have been trout in</p>
<p>it.  A certain look came over the boyÔøΩÔøΩs face.  He gazed at me</p>
<p>solemnly, as if he were searching the inmost depths of my character</p>
<p>before he spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, do you want to know something?&quot;</p>
<p>I assured him that an increase of knowledge was the chief aim of my</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you promise you wonÔøΩÔøΩt tell?&quot;</p>
<p>I expressed my readiness to be bound to silence by the most awful</p>
<p>pledge that the law would sanction.</p>
<p>&quot;Wish you may die?&quot;</p>
<p>I not only wished that I might die, but was perfectly certain that I</p>
<p>would die.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, whatÔøΩÔøΩs the matter with catching trout in that brook now?  Do</p>
<p>you want to go with me next Saturday?  I saw four or five bully ones</p>
<p>last week, and got three.&quot;</p>
<p>On the appointed day we made the voyage, landed at the upper bridge,</p>
<p>walked around by the woodpath to the railroad embankment, and began</p>
<p>to worm our way down through the tangled wilderness.  Fly-fishing,</p>
<p>of course, was out of the question.  The only possible method of</p>
<p>angling was to let the line, baited with a juicy &quot;garden hackle,&quot;</p>
<p>drift down the current as far as possible before you, under the</p>
<p>alder-branches and the cat-briers, into the holes and corners of the</p>
<p>stream.  Then, if there came a gentle tug on the rod, you must</p>
<p>strike, to one side or the other, as the branches might allow, and</p>
<p>trust wholly to luck for a chance to play the fish.  Many a trout we</p>
<p>lost that day,--the largest ones, of course,--and many a hook was</p>
<p>embedded in a sunken log, or hopelessly entwined among the boughs</p>
<p>overhead.  But when we came out at the bridge, very wet and</p>
<p>disheveled, we had seven pretty fish, the heaviest about half a</p>
<p>pound.  The Fairy Dell yielded a brace of smaller ones, and</p>
<p>altogether we were reasonably happy as we took up the oars and</p>
<p>pushed out upon the open stream.</p>
<p>But if there were fish above, why should there not be fish below?</p>
<p>It was about sunset, the anglerÔøΩÔøΩs golden hour.  We were already</p>
<p>committed to the crime of being late for supper.  It would add</p>
<p>little to our guilt and much to our pleasure to drift slowly down</p>
<p>the middle of the brook and cast the artful fly in the deeper</p>
<p>corners on either shore.  So I took off the vulgar bait-hook and put</p>
<p>on a delicate leader with a Queen of the Water for a tail-fly and a</p>
<p>Yellow Sally for a dropper,--innocent little confections of feathers</p>
<p>and tinsel, dressed on the tiniest hooks, and calculated to tempt</p>
<p>the appetite or the curiosity of the most capricious trout.</p>
<p>For a long time the whipping of the water produced no result, and it</p>
<p>seemed as if the dainty style of angling were destined to prove less</p>
<p>profitable than plain fishing with a worm.  But presently we came to</p>
<p>an elbow of the brook, just above the estuary, where there was quite</p>
<p>a stretch of clear water along the lower side, with two half-sunken</p>
<p>logs sticking out from the bank, against which the current had</p>
<p>drifted a broad raft of weeds.  I made a long cast, and sent the</p>
<p>tail-fly close to the edge of the weeds.  There was a swelling</p>
<p>ripple on the surface of the water, and a noble fish darted from</p>
<p>under the logs, dashed at the fly, missed it, and whirled back to</p>
<p>his shelter.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!&quot; said the boy, &quot;that was a whacker!  He made a wake like a</p>
<p>steamboat.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a moment for serious thought.  What was best to be done with</p>
<p>that fish?  Leave him to settle down for the night and come back</p>
<p>after him another day?  Or try another cast for him at once?  A fish</p>
<p>on Saturday evening is worth two on Monday morning.  I changed the</p>
<p>Queen of the Water for a Royal Coachman tied on a number fourteen</p>
<p>hook,--white wings, peacock body with a belt of crimson silk,--and</p>
<p>sent it out again, a foot farther up the stream and a shade closer</p>
<p>to the weeds.  As it settled on the water, there was a flash of gold</p>
<p>from the shadow beneath the logs, and a quick turn of the wrist made</p>
<p>the tiny hook fast in the fish.  He fought wildly to get back to the</p>
<p>shelter of his logs, but the four ounce rod had spring enough in it</p>
<p>to hold him firmly away from that dangerous retreat.  Then he</p>
<p>splurged up and down the open water, and made fierce dashes among</p>
<p>the grassy shallows, and seemed about to escape a dozen times.  But</p>
<p>at last his force was played out; he came slowly towards the boat,</p>
<p>turning on his side, and I netted him in my hat.</p>
<p>&quot;Bully for us;&quot; said the boy, &quot;we got him!  What a dandy!&quot;</p>
<p>It was indeed one of the handsomest fish that I have ever taken on</p>
<p>the South Side,--just short of two pounds and a quarter,--small</p>
<p>head, broad tail, and well-rounded sides coloured with orange and</p>
<p>blue and gold and red.  A pair of the same kind, one weighing two</p>
<p>pounds and the other a pound and three quarters, were taken by</p>
<p>careful fishing down the lower end of the pool, and then we rowed</p>
<p>home through the dusk, pleasantly convinced that there is no virtue</p>
<p>more certainly rewarded than the patience of anglers, and entirely</p>
<p>willing to put up with a cold supper and a mild reproof for the sake</p>
<p>of sport.</p>
<p>Of course we could not resist the temptation to show those fish to</p>
<p>the neighbours.  But, equally of course, we evaded the request to</p>
<p>give precise information as to the precise place where they were</p>
<p>caught.  Indeed, I fear that there must have been something confused</p>
<p>in our description of where we had been on that afternoon.  Our</p>
<p>carefully selected language may have been open to misunderstanding.</p>
<p>At all events, the next day, which was the Sabbath, there was a row</p>
<p>of eager but unprincipled anglers sitting on a bridge OVER ANOTHER</p>
<p>STREAM, and fishing for trout with worms and large expectations, but</p>
<p>without visible results.</p>
<p>The boy and I agreed that if this did not teach a good moral lesson</p>
<p>it was not our fault.</p>
<p>I obtained the boyÔøΩÔøΩs consent to admit the partner of my lifeÔøΩÔøΩs joys</p>
<p>and two of our children to the secret of the brook, and thereafter,</p>
<p>when we visited it, we took the fly-rod with us.  If by chance</p>
<p>another boat passed us in the estuary, we were never fishing, but</p>
<p>only gathering flowers, or going for a picnic, or taking</p>
<p>photographs.  But when the uninitiated ones had passed by, we would</p>
<p>get out the rod again, and try a few more casts.</p>
<p>One day in particular I remember, when Graygown and little Teddy</p>
<p>were my companions.  We really had no hopes of angling, for the hour</p>
<p>was mid-noon, and the day was warm and still.  But suddenly the</p>
<p>trout, by one of those unaccountable freaks which make their</p>
<p>disposition so interesting and attractive, began to rise all about</p>
<p>us in a bend of the stream.</p>
<p>&quot;Look!&quot; said Teddy; &quot;wherever you see one of those big smiles on the</p>
<p>water, I believe thereÔøΩÔøΩs a fish!&quot;</p>
<p>Fortunately the rod was at hand.  Graygown and Teddy managed the</p>
<p>boat and the landing-net with consummate skill.  We landed no less</p>
<p>than a dozen beautiful fish at that most unlikely hour and then</p>
<p>solemnly shook hands all around.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar pleasure in doing a thing like this, catching</p>
<p>trout in a place where nobody thinks of looking for them, and at an</p>
<p>hour when everybody believes they cannot be caught.  It is more fun</p>
<p>to take one good fish out of an old, fished-out stream, near at hand</p>
<p>to the village, than to fill a basket from some far-famed and well-</p>
<p>stocked water.  It is the unexpected touch that tickles our sense of</p>
<p>pleasure.  While life lasts, we are always hoping for it and</p>
<p>expecting it.  There is no country so civilized, no existence so</p>
<p>humdrum, that there is not room enough in it somewhere for a lazy,</p>
<p>idle brook, an encourager of indolence, with hope of happy</p>
<p>surprises.</p>
<p>THE OPEN FIRE</p>
<p>&quot;It is a vulgar notion that a fire is only for heat.  A chief value</p>
<p>of it is, however, to look at.  And it is never twice the same.&quot;--</p>
<p>CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER: Backlog Studies.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>LIGHTING UP</p>
<p>Man is the animal that has made friends with the fire.</p>
<p>All the other creatures, in their natural state, are afraid of it.</p>
<p>They look upon it with wonder and dismay.  It fascinates them,</p>
<p>sometimes, with its glittering eyes in the night.  The squirrels and</p>
<p>the hares come pattering softly towards it through the underbrush</p>
<p>around the new camp.  The fascinated deer stares into the blaze of</p>
<p>the jack-light while the hunterÔøΩÔøΩs canoe creeps through the lily-</p>
<p>pads.  But the charm that masters them is one of dread, not of love.</p>
<p>It is the witchcraft of the serpentÔøΩÔøΩs lambent look.  When they know</p>
<p>what it means, when the heat of the fire touches them, or even when</p>
<p>its smell comes clearly to their most delicate sense, they recognize</p>
<p>it as their enemy, the Wild Huntsman whose red hounds can follow,</p>
<p>follow for days without wearying, growing stronger and more furious</p>
<p>with every turn of the chase.  Let but a trail of smoke drift down</p>
<p>the wind across the forest, and all the game for miles and miles</p>
<p>will catch the signal for fear and flight.</p>
<p>Many of the animals have learned how to make houses for themselves.</p>
<p>The CABANE of the beaver is a wonder of neatness and comfort, much</p>
<p>preferable to the wigwam of his Indian hunter.  The muskrat knows</p>
<p>how thick and high to build the dome of his waterside cottage, in</p>
<p>order to protect himself against the frost of the coming winter and</p>
<p>the floods of the following spring.  The woodchuckÔøΩÔøΩs house has two</p>
<p>or three doors; and the squirrelÔøΩÔøΩs dwelling is provided with a good</p>
<p>bed and a convenient storehouse for nuts and acorns.  The sportive</p>
<p>otters have a toboggan slide in front of their residence; and the</p>
<p>moose in winter make a &quot;yard,&quot; where they can take exercise</p>
<p>comfortably and find shelter for sleep.  But there is one thing</p>
<p>lacking in all these various dwellings,--a fireplace.</p>
<p>Man is the only creature that dares to light a fire and to live with</p>
<p>it.  The reason?  Because he alone has learned how to put it out.</p>
<p>It is true that two of his humbler friends have been converted to</p>
<p>fire-worship.  The dog and the cat, being half-humanized, have begun</p>
<p>to love the fire.  I suppose that a cat seldom comes so near to</p>
<p>feeling a true sense of affection as when she has finished her</p>
<p>saucer of bread and milk, and stretched herself luxuriously</p>
<p>underneath the kitchen stove, while her faithful mistress washes up</p>
<p>the dishes.  As for a dog, I am sure that his admiring love for his</p>
<p>master is never greater than when they come in together from the</p>
<p>hunt, wet and tired, and the man gathers a pile of wood in front of</p>
<p>the tent, touches it with a tiny magic wand, and suddenly the clear,</p>
<p>consoling flame springs up, saying cheerfully, &quot;Here we are, at home</p>
<p>in the forest; come into the warmth; rest, and eat, and sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>When the weary, shivering dog sees this miracle, he knows that his</p>
<p>master is a great man and a lord of things.</p>
<p>After all, that is the only real open fire.  Wood is the fuel for</p>
<p>it.  Out-of-doors is the place for it.  A furnace is an underground</p>
<p>prison for a toiling slave.  A stove is a cage for a tame bird.</p>
<p>Even a broad hearthstone and a pair of glittering andirons--the best</p>
<p>ornament of a room--must be accepted as an imitation of the real</p>
<p>thing.  The veritable open fire is built in the open, with the whole</p>
<p>earth for a fireplace and the sky for a chimney.</p>
<p>To start a fire in the open is by no means as easy as it looks.  It</p>
<p>is one of those simple tricks that every one thinks he can perform</p>
<p>until he tries it.</p>
<p>To do it without trying,--accidentally and unwillingly,--that, of</p>
<p>course, is a thing for which any fool is fit.  You knock out the</p>
<p>ashes from your pipe on a fallen log; you toss the end of a match</p>
<p>into a patch of grass, green on top, but dry as punk underneath; you</p>
<p>scatter the dead brands of an old fire among the moss,--a</p>
<p>conflagration is under way before you know it.</p>
<p>A fire in the woods is one thing; a comfort and a joy.  Fire in the</p>
<p>woods is another thing; a terror, an uncontrollable fury, a burning</p>
<p>shame.</p>
<p>But the lighting up of a proper fire, kindly, approachable,</p>
<p>serviceable, docile, is a work of intelligence.  If, perhaps, you</p>
<p>have to do it in the rain, with a single match, it requires no</p>
<p>little art and skill.</p>
<p>There is plenty of wood everywhere, but not a bit to burn.  The</p>
<p>fallen trees are waterlogged.  The dead leaves are as damp as grief.</p>
<p>The charred sticks that you find in an old fireplace are absolutely</p>
<p>incombustible.  Do not trust the handful of withered twigs and</p>
<p>branches that you gather from the spruce-trees.  They seem dry, but</p>
<p>they are little better for your purpose than so much asbestos.  You</p>
<p>make a pile of them in some apparently suitable hollow, and lay a</p>
<p>few larger sticks on top.  Then you hastily scratch your solitary</p>
<p>match on the seat of your trousers and thrust it into the pile of</p>
<p>twigs.  What happens?  The wind whirls around in your stupid little</p>
<p>hollow, and the blue flame of the sulphur spirts and sputters for an</p>
<p>instant, and then goes out.  Or perhaps there is a moment of</p>
<p>stillness; the match flares up bravely; the nearest twigs catch</p>
<p>fire, crackling and sparkling; you hurriedly lay on more sticks; but</p>
<p>the fire deliberately dodges them, creeps to the corner of the pile</p>
<p>where the twigs are fewest and dampest, snaps feebly a few times,</p>
<p>and expires in smoke.  Now where are you?  How far is it to the</p>
<p>nearest match?</p>
<p>If you are wise, you will always make your fire before you light it.</p>
<p>Time is never saved by doing a thing badly.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>THE CAMP-FIRE</p>
<p>In the making of fires there is as much difference as in the</p>
<p>building of houses.  Everything depends upon the purpose that you</p>
<p>have in view.  There is the camp-fire, and the cooking-fire, and the</p>
<p>smudge-fire, and the little friendship-fire,--not to speak of other</p>
<p>minor varieties.  Each of these has its own proper style of</p>
<p>architecture, and to mix them is false art and poor economy.</p>
<p>The object of the camp-fire is to give heat, and incidentally light,</p>
<p>to your tent or shanty.  You can hardly build this kind of a fire</p>
<p>unless you have a good axe and know how to chop.  For the first</p>
<p>thing that you need is a solid backlog, the thicker the better, to</p>
<p>hold the heat and reflect it into the tent.  This log must not be</p>
<p>too dry, or it will burn out quickly.  Neither must it be too damp,</p>
<p>else it will smoulder and discourage the fire.  The best wood for it</p>
<p>is the body of a yellow birch, and, next to that, a green balsam.</p>
<p>It should be five or six feet long, and at least two and a half feet</p>
<p>in diameter.  If you cannot find a tree thick enough, cut two or</p>
<p>three lengths of a smaller one; lay the thickest log on the ground</p>
<p>first, about ten or twelve feet in front of the tent; drive two</p>
<p>strong stakes behind it, slanting a little backward; and lay the</p>
<p>other logs on top of the first, resting against the stakes.</p>
<p>Now you are ready for the hand-chunks, or andirons.  These are</p>
<p>shorter sticks of wood, eight or ten inches thick, laid at right</p>
<p>angles to the backlog, four or five feet apart.  Across these you</p>
<p>are to build up the firewood proper.</p>
<p>Use a dry spruce-tree, not one that has fallen, but one that is dead</p>
<p>and still standing, if you want a lively, snapping fire.  Use a hard</p>
<p>maple or a hickory if you want a fire that will burn steadily and</p>
<p>make few sparks.  But if you like a fire to blaze up at first with a</p>
<p>splendid flame, and then burn on with an enduring heat far into the</p>
<p>night, a young white birch with the bark on is the tree to choose.</p>
<p>Six or eight round sticks of this laid across the hand-chunks, with</p>
<p>perhaps a few quarterings of a larger tree, will make a glorious</p>
<p>fire.</p>
<p>But before you put these on, you must be ready to light up.  A few</p>
<p>splinters of dry spruce or pine or balsam, stood endwise against the</p>
<p>backlog, or, better still, piled up in a pyramid between the hand-</p>
<p>chunks; a few strips of birch-bark; and one good match,--these are</p>
<p>all that you want.  But be sure that your match is a good one.  It</p>
<p>is better to see to this before you go into the brush.  Your</p>
<p>comfort, even your life, may depend on it.</p>
<p>&quot;AVEC CES ALLUMETTES-LA,&quot; said my guide at LAC ST. JEAN one day, as</p>
<p>he vainly tried to light his pipe with a box of parlour matches from</p>
<p>the hotel,--AVEC CES GNOGNOTTES DÔøΩÔøΩALLUMETTES ON POURRA MOURIR AU</p>
<p>BOIS!&quot;</p>
<p>In the woods, the old-fashioned brimstone match of our grandfathers--</p>
<p>the match with a brown head and a stout stick and a dreadful smell--</p>
<p>is the best.  But if you have only one, do not trust even that to</p>
<p>light your fire directly.  Use it first to touch off a roll of</p>
<p>birch-bark which you hold in your hand.  Then, when the bark is well</p>
<p>alight, crinkling and curling, push it under the heap of kindlings,</p>
<p>give the flame time to take a good hold, and lay your wood over it,</p>
<p>a stick at a time, until the whole pile is blazing.  Now your fire</p>
<p>is started.  Your friendly little red-haired gnome is ready to serve</p>
<p>you through the night.</p>
<p>He will dry your clothes if you are wet.  He will cheer you up if</p>
<p>you are despondent.  He will diffuse an air of sociability through</p>
<p>the camp, and draw the men together in a half circle for</p>
<p>storytelling and jokes and singing.  He will hold a flambeau for you</p>
<p>while you spread your blankets on the boughs and dress for bed.  He</p>
<p>will keep you warm while you sleep,--at least till about three</p>
<p>oÔøΩÔøΩclock in the morning, when you dream that you are out sleighing in</p>
<p>your pajamas, and wake up with a shiver.</p>
<p>&quot;HOLA, FERDINAND, FRANCOIS!&quot; you call out from your bed, pulling the</p>
<p>blankets over your ears; &quot;RAMANCHEZ LE FEU, SÔøΩÔøΩIL VOUS PLAIT.  CÔøΩÔøΩEST</p>
<p>UN FREITE DE CHIEN.&quot;</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>THE COOKING-FIRE</p>
<p>Of course such a fire as I have been describing can be used for</p>
<p>cooking, when it has burned down a little, and there is a bed of hot</p>
<p>embers in front of the backlog.  But a correct kitchen fire should</p>
<p>be constructed after another fashion.  What you want now is not</p>
<p>blaze, but heat, and that not diffused, but concentrated.  You must</p>
<p>be able to get close to your fire without burning your boots or</p>
<p>scorching your face.</p>
<p>If you have time and the material, make a fireplace of big stones.</p>
<p>But not of granite, for that will split with the heat, and perhaps</p>
<p>fly in your face.</p>
<p>If you are in a hurry and there are no suitable stones at hand, lay</p>
<p>two good logs nearly parallel with each other, a foot or so apart,</p>
<p>and build your fire between them.  For a cooking-fire, use split</p>
<p>wood in short sticks.  Let the first supply burn to glowing coals</p>
<p>before you begin.  A frying-pan that is lukewarm one minute and red-</p>
<p>hot the next is the abomination of desolation.  If you want black</p>
<p>toast, have it made before a fresh, sputtering, blazing heap of</p>
<p>wood.</p>
<p>In fires, as in men, an excess of energy is a lack of usefulness.</p>
<p>The best work is done without many sparks.  Just enough is the right</p>
<p>kind of a fire and a feast.</p>
<p>To know how to cook is not a very elegant accomplishment.  Yet there</p>
<p>are times and seasons when it seems to come in better than</p>
<p>familiarity with the dead languages, or much skill upon the lute.</p>
<p>You cannot always rely on your guides for a tasteful preparation of</p>
<p>food.  Many of them are ignorant of the difference between frying</p>
<p>and broiling, and their notion of boiling a potato or a fish is to</p>
<p>reduce it to a pulp.  Now and then you find a man who has a natural</p>
<p>inclination to the culinary art, and who does very well within</p>
<p>familiar limits.</p>
<p>Old Edouard, the Montaignais Indian who cooked for my friends H. E.</p>
<p>G. and C. S. D. last summer on the STE. MARGUERITE EN BAS, was such</p>
<p>a man.  But Edouard could not read, and the only way he could tell</p>
<p>the nature of the canned provisions was by the pictures on the cans.</p>
<p>If the picture was strange to him, there was no guessing what he</p>
<p>would do with the contents of the can.  He was capable of roasting</p>
<p>strawberries, and serving green peas cold for dessert.  One day a</p>
<p>can of mullagatawny soup and a can of apricots were handed out to</p>
<p>him simultaneously and without explanations.  Edouard solved the</p>
<p>problem by opening both cans and cooking them together.  We had a</p>
<p>new soup that day, MULLAGATAWNY AUX APRICOTS.  It was not as bad as</p>
<p>it sounds.  It tasted somewhat like chutney.</p>
<p>The real reason why food that is cooked over an open fire tastes so</p>
<p>good to us is because we are really hungry when we get it.  The man</p>
<p>who puts up provisions for camp has a great advantage over the</p>
<p>dealers who must satisfy the pampered appetite of people in houses.</p>
<p>I never can get any bacon in New York like that which I buy at a</p>
<p>little shop in Quebec to take into the woods.  If I ever set up in</p>
<p>the grocery business, I shall try to get a good trade among anglers.</p>
<p>It will be easy to please my customers.</p>
<p>The reputation that trout enjoy as a food-fish is partly due to the</p>
<p>fact that they are usually cooked over an open fire.  In the city</p>
<p>they never taste as good.  It is not merely a difference in</p>
<p>freshness.  It is a change in the sauce.  If the truth must be told,</p>
<p>even by an angler, there are at least five salt-water fish which are</p>
<p>better than trout,--to eat.  There is none better to catch.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>THE SMUDGE-FIRE</p>
<p>But enough of the cooking-fire.  Let us turn now to the subject of</p>
<p>the smudge, known in Lower Canada as LA BOUCANE.  The smudge owes</p>
<p>its existence to the pungent mosquito, the sanguinary black-fly, and</p>
<p>the peppery midge,--LE MARINGOUIN, LA MOUSTIQUE, ET LE BRULOT.  To</p>
<p>what it owes its English name I do not know; but its French name</p>
<p>means simply a thick, nauseating, intolerable smoke.</p>
<p>The smudge is called into being for the express purpose of creating</p>
<p>a smoke of this kind, which is as disagreeable to the mosquito, the</p>
<p>black-fly, and the midge as it is to the man whom they are</p>
<p>devouring.  But the man survives the smoke, while the insects</p>
<p>succumb to it, being destroyed or driven away.  Therefore the</p>
<p>smudge, dark and bitter in itself, frequently becomes, like</p>
<p>adversity, sweet in its uses.  It must be regarded as a form of fire</p>
<p>with which man has made friends under the pressure of a cruel</p>
<p>necessity.</p>
<p>It would seem as if it ought to be the simplest affair in the world</p>
<p>to light up a smudge.  And so it is--if you are not trying.</p>
<p>An attempt to produce almost any other kind of a fire will bring</p>
<p>forth smoke abundantly.  But when you deliberately undertake to</p>
<p>create a smudge, flames break from the wettest timber, and green</p>
<p>moss blazes with a furious heat.  You hastily gather handfuls of</p>
<p>seemingly incombustible material and throw it on the fire, but the</p>
<p>conflagration increases.  Grass and green leaves hesitate for an</p>
<p>instant and then flash up like tinder.  The more you put on, the</p>
<p>more your smudge rebels against its proper task of smudging.  It</p>
<p>makes a pleasant warmth, to encourage the black-flies; and bright</p>
<p>light to attract and cheer the mosquitoes.  Your effort is a</p>
<p>brilliant failure.</p>
<p>The proper way to make a smudge is this.  Begin with a very little,</p>
<p>lowly fire.  Let it be bright, but not ambitious.  DonÔøΩÔøΩt try to make</p>
<p>a smoke yet.</p>
<p>Then gather a good supply of stuff which seems likely to suppress</p>
<p>fire without smothering it.  Moss of a certain kind will do, but not</p>
<p>the soft, feathery moss that grows so deep among the spruce-trees.</p>
<p>Half-decayed wood is good; spongy, moist, unpleasant stuff, a</p>
<p>vegetable wet blanket.  The bark of dead evergreen trees, hemlock,</p>
<p>spruce, or balsam, is better still.  Gather a plentiful store of it.</p>
<p>But donÔøΩÔøΩt try to make a smoke yet.</p>
<p>Let your fire burn a while longer; cheer it up a little.  Get some</p>
<p>clear, resolute, unquenchable coals aglow in the heart of it.  DonÔøΩÔøΩt</p>
<p>try to make a smoke yet.</p>
<p>Now pile on your smouldering fuel.  Fan it with your hat.  Kneel</p>
<p>down and blow it, and in ten minutes you will have a smoke that will</p>
<p>make you wish you had never been born.</p>
<p>That is the proper way to make a smudge.  But the easiest way is to</p>
<p>ask your guide to make it for you.</p>
<p>If he makes it in an old iron pot, so much the better, for then you</p>
<p>can move it around to the windward when the breeze veers, and carry</p>
<p>it into your tent without risk of setting everything on fire, and</p>
<p>even take it with you in the canoe while you are fishing.</p>
<p>Some of the pleasantest pictures in the anglerÔøΩÔøΩs gallery of</p>
<p>remembrance are framed in the smoke that rises from a smudge.</p>
<p>With my eyes shut, I can call up a vision of eight birch-bark canoes</p>
<p>floating side by side on Moosehead Lake, on a fair June morning,</p>
<p>fifteen years ago.  They are anchored off Green Island, riding</p>
<p>easily on the long, gentle waves.  In the stern of each canoe there</p>
<p>is a guide with a long-handled net; in the bow, an angler with a</p>
<p>light fly-rod; in the middle, a smudge-kettle, smoking steadily.  In</p>
<p>the air to the windward of the little fleet hovers a swarm of flies</p>
<p>drifting down on the shore breeze, with bloody purpose in their</p>
<p>breasts, but baffled by the protecting smoke.  In the water to the</p>
<p>leeward plays a school of speckled trout, feeding on the minnows</p>
<p>that hang around the sunken ledges of rock.  As a larger wave than</p>
<p>usual passes over the ledges, it lifts the fish up, and you can see</p>
<p>the big fellows, three, and four, and even five pounds apiece,</p>
<p>poising themselves in the clear brown water.  A long cast will send</p>
<p>the fly over one of them.  Let it sink a foot.  Draw it up with a</p>
<p>fluttering motion.  Now the fish sees it, and turns to catch it.</p>
<p>There is a yellow gleam in the depth, a sudden swirl on the surface;</p>
<p>you strike sharply, and the trout is matching his strength against</p>
<p>the spring of your four ounces of split bamboo.</p>
<p>You can guess at his size, as he breaks water, by the breadth of his</p>
<p>tail: a pound of weight to an inch of tail,--that is the traditional</p>
<p>measure, and it usually comes pretty close to the mark, at least in</p>
<p>the case of large fish.  But it is never safe to record the weight</p>
<p>until the trout is in the canoe.  As the Canadian hunters say, &quot;Sell</p>
<p>not the skin of the bear while he carries it.&quot;</p>
<p>Now the breeze that blows over Green Island drops away, and the</p>
<p>smoke of the eight smudge-kettles falls like a thick curtain.  The</p>
<p>canoes, the dark shores of Norcross Point, the twin peaks of Spencer</p>
<p>Mountain, the dim blue summit of Katahdin, the dazzling sapphire</p>
<p>sky, the flocks of fleece-white clouds shepherded on high by the</p>
<p>western wind, all have vanished.  With closed eyes I see another</p>
<p>vision, still framed in smoke,--a vision of yesterday.</p>
<p>It is a wild river flowing into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, on the</p>
<p>COTE NORD, far down towards Labrador.  There is a long, narrow,</p>
<p>swift pool between two parallel ridges of rock.  Over the ridge on</p>
<p>the right pours a cataract of pale yellow foam.  At the bottom of</p>
<p>the pool, the water slides down into a furious rapid, and dashes</p>
<p>straight through an impassable gorge half a mile to the sea.  The</p>
<p>pool is full of salmon, leaping merrily in their delight at coming</p>
<p>into their native stream.  The air is full of black-flies, rejoicing</p>
<p>in the warmth of the July sun.  On a slippery point of rock, below</p>
<p>the fall, are two anglers, tempting the fish and enduring the flies.</p>
<p>Behind them is an old HABITANT raising a mighty column of smoke.</p>
<p>Through the cloudy pillar which keeps back the Egyptian host, you</p>
<p>see the waving of a long rod.  A silver-gray fly with a barbed tail</p>
<p>darts out across the pool, swings around with the current, well</p>
<p>under water, and slowly works past the big rock in the centre, just</p>
<p>at the head of the rapid.  Almost past it, but not quite: for</p>
<p>suddenly the fly disappears; the line begins to run out; the reel</p>
<p>sings sharp and shrill; a salmon is hooked.</p>
<p>But how well is he hooked?  That is the question.  This is no easy</p>
<p>pool to play a fish in.  There is no chance to jump into a canoe and</p>
<p>drop below him, and get the current to help you in drowning him.</p>
<p>You cannot follow him along the shore.  You cannot even lead him</p>
<p>into quiet water, where the gaffer can creep near to him unseen and</p>
<p>drag him in with a quick stroke.  You must fight your fish to a</p>
<p>finish, and all the advantages are on his side.  The current is</p>
<p>terribly strong.  If he makes up his mind to go downstream to the</p>
<p>sea, the only thing you can do is to hold him by main force; and</p>
<p>then it is ten to one that the hook tears out or the leader breaks.</p>
<p>It is not in human nature for one man to watch another handling a</p>
<p>fish in such a place without giving advice.  &quot;Keep the tip of your</p>
<p>rod up.  DonÔøΩÔøΩt let your reel overrun.  Stir him up a little, he ÔøΩÔøΩs</p>
<p>sulking.  DonÔøΩÔøΩt let him ÔøΩÔøΩjig,ÔøΩÔøΩ or youÔøΩÔøΩll lose him.  You ÔøΩÔøΩre playing</p>
<p>him too hard.  There, he ÔøΩÔøΩs going to jump again.  Drop your tip.</p>
<p>Stop him, quick! he ÔøΩÔøΩs going down the rapid!&quot;</p>
<p>Of course the man who is playing the salmon does not like this.  If</p>
<p>he is quick-tempered, sooner or later he tells his counsellor to</p>
<p>shut up.  But if he is a gentle, early-Christian kind of a man, wise</p>
<p>as a serpent and harmless as a dove, he follows the advice that is</p>
<p>given to him, promptly and exactly.  Then, when it is all ended, and</p>
<p>he has seen the big fish, with the line over his shoulder, poised</p>
<p>for an instant on the crest of the first billow of the rapid, and</p>
<p>has felt the leader stretch and give and SNAP!--then he can have the</p>
<p>satisfaction, while he reels in his slack line, of saying to his</p>
<p>friend, &quot;Well, old man, I did everything just as you told me.  But I</p>
<p>think if I had pushed that fish a little harder at the beginning, AS</p>
<p>I WANTED TO, I might have saved him.&quot;</p>
<p>But really, of course, the chances were all against it.  In such a</p>
<p>pool, most of the larger fish get away.  Their weight gives them a</p>
<p>tremendous pull.  The fish that are stopped from going into the</p>
<p>rapid, and dragged back from the curling wave, are usually the</p>
<p>smaller ones.  Here they are,--twelve pounds, eight pounds, six</p>
<p>pounds, five pounds and a half, FOUR POUNDS!  Is not this the</p>
<p>smallest salmon that you ever saw?  Not a grilse, you understand,</p>
<p>but a real salmon, of brightest silver, hall-marked with St.</p>
<p>AndrewÔøΩÔøΩs cross.</p>
<p>Now let us sit down for a moment and watch the fish trying to leap</p>
<p>up the falls.  There is a clear jump of about ten feet, and above</p>
<p>that an apparently impossible climb of ten feet more up a ladder of</p>
<p>twisting foam.  A salmon darts from the boiling water at the bottom</p>
<p>of the fall like an arrow from a bow.  He rises in a beautiful</p>
<p>curve, fins laid close to his body and tail quivering; but he has</p>
<p>miscalculated his distance.  He is on the downward curve when the</p>
<p>water strikes him and tumbles him back.  A bold little fish, not</p>
<p>more than eighteen inches long, makes a jump at the side of the</p>
<p>fall, where the water is thin, and is rolled over and over in the</p>
<p>spray.  A larger salmon rises close beside us with a tremendous</p>
<p>rush, bumps his nose against a jutting rock, and flops back into the</p>
<p>pool.  Now comes a fish who has made his calculations exactly.  He</p>
<p>leaves the pool about eight feet from the foot of the fall, rises</p>
<p>swiftly, spreads his fins, and curves his tail as if he were flying,</p>
<p>strikes the water where it is thickest just below the brink, holds</p>
<p>on desperately, and drives himself, with one last wriggle, through</p>
<p>the bending stream, over the edge, and up the first step of the</p>
<p>foaming stairway.  He has obeyed the strongest instinct of his</p>
<p>nature, and gone up to make love in the highest fresh water that he</p>
<p>can reach.</p>
<p>The smoke of the smudge-fire is sharp and tearful, but a man can</p>
<p>learn to endure a good deal of it when he can look through its rings</p>
<p>at such scenes as these.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>THE LITTLE FRIENDSHIP-FIRE</p>
<p>There are times and seasons when the angler has no need of any of</p>
<p>the three fires of which we have been talking.  He sleeps in a</p>
<p>house.  His breakfast and dinner are cooked for him in a kitchen.</p>
<p>He is in no great danger from black-flies or mosquitoes.  All he</p>
<p>needs now, as he sets out to spend a day on the Neversink, or the</p>
<p>Willowemoc, or the Shepaug, or the Swiftwater, is a good lunch in</p>
<p>his pocket, and a little friendship-fire to burn pleasantly beside</p>
<p>him while he eats his frugal fare and prolongs his noonday rest.</p>
<p>This form of fire does less work than any other in the world.  Yet</p>
<p>it is far from being useless; and I, for one, should be sorry to</p>
<p>live without it.  Its only use is to make a visible centre of</p>
<p>interest where there are two or three anglers eating their lunch</p>
<p>together, or to supply a kind of companionship to a lone fisherman.</p>
<p>It is kindled and burns for no other purpose than to give you the</p>
<p>sense of being at home and at ease.  Why the fire should do this, I</p>
<p>cannot tell, but it does.</p>
<p>You may build your friendship-fire in almost any way that pleases</p>
<p>you; but this is the way in which you shall build it best.  You have</p>
<p>no axe, of course, so you must look about for the driest sticks that</p>
<p>you can find.  Do not seek them close beside the stream, for there</p>
<p>they are likely to be water-soaked; but go back into the woods a bit</p>
<p>and gather a good armful of fuel.  Then break it, if you can, into</p>
<p>lengths of about two feet, and construct your fire in the following</p>
<p>fashion.</p>
<p>Lay two sticks parallel, and put between them a pile of dried grass,</p>
<p>dead leaves, small twigs, and the paper in which your lunch was</p>
<p>wrapped.  Then lay two other sticks crosswise on top of your first</p>
<p>pair.  Strike your match and touch your kindlings.  As the fire</p>
<p>catches, lay on other pairs of sticks, each pair crosswise to the</p>
<p>pair that is below it, until you have a pyramid of flame.  This is</p>
<p>&quot;a Micmac fire&quot; such as the Indians make in the woods.</p>
<p>Now you can pull off your wading-boots and warm your feet at the</p>
<p>blaze.  You can toast your bread if you like.  You can even make</p>
<p>shift to broil one of your trout, fastened on the end of a birch</p>
<p>twig if you have a fancy that way.  When your hunger is satisfied,</p>
<p>you shake out the crumbs for the birds and the squirrels, pick up a</p>
<p>stick with a coal at the end to light your pipe, put some more wood</p>
<p>on your fire, and settle down for an hourÔøΩÔøΩs reading if you have a</p>
<p>book in your pocket, or for a good talk if you have a comrade with</p>
<p>you.</p>
<p>The stream of time flows swift and smooth, by such a fire as this.</p>
<p>The moments slip past unheeded; the sun sinks down his western arch;</p>
<p>the shadows begin to fall across the brook; it is time to move on</p>
<p>for the afternoon fishing.  The fire has almost burned out.  But do</p>
<p>not trust it too much.  Throw some sand over it, or bring a hatful</p>
<p>of water from the brook to pour on it, until you are sure that the</p>
<p>last glowing ember is extinguished, and nothing but the black coals</p>
<p>and the charred ends of the sticks are left.</p>
<p>Even the little friendship-fire must keep the law of the bush.  All</p>
<p>lights out when their purpose is fulfilled!</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>ALTARS OF REMEMBRANCE</p>
<p>It is a question that we have often debated, in the informal</p>
<p>meetings of our Petrine Club: Which is pleasanter,--to fish an old</p>
<p>stream, or a new one?</p>
<p>The younger members are all for the &quot;fresh woods and pastures new.&quot;</p>
<p>They speak of the delight of turning off from the high-road into</p>
<p>some faintly-marked trail; following it blindly through the forest,</p>
<p>not knowing how far you have to go; hearing the voice of waters</p>
<p>sounding through the woodland; leaving the path impatiently and</p>
<p>striking straight across the underbrush; scrambling down a steep</p>
<p>bank, pushing through a thicket of alders, and coming out suddenly,</p>
<p>face to face with a beautiful, strange brook.  It reminds you, of</p>
<p>course, of some old friend.  It is a little like the Beaverkill, or</p>
<p>the Ausable, or the Gale River.  And yet it is different.  Every</p>
<p>stream has its own character and disposition.  Your new acquaintance</p>
<p>invites you to a day of discoveries.  If the water is high, you will</p>
<p>follow it down, and have easy fishing.  If the water is low, you</p>
<p>will go upstream, and fish &quot;fine and far-off.&quot;  Every turn in the</p>
<p>avenue which the little river has made for you opens up a new view,--</p>
<p>a rocky gorge where the deep pools are divided by white-footed</p>
<p>falls; a lofty forest where the shadows are deep and the trees arch</p>
<p>overhead; a flat, sunny stretch where the stream is spread out, and</p>
<p>pebbly islands divide the channels, and the big fish are lurking at</p>
<p>the sides in the sheltered corners under the bushes.  From scene to</p>
<p>scene you follow on, delighted and expectant, until the night</p>
<p>suddenly drops its veil, and then you will be lucky if you can find</p>
<p>your way home in the dark!</p>
<p>Yes, it is all very good, this exploration of new streams.  But, for</p>
<p>my part, I like still better to go back to a familiar little river,</p>
<p>and fish or dream along the banks where I have dreamed and fished</p>
<p>before.  I know every bend and curve: the sharp turn where the water</p>
<p>runs under the roots of the old hemlock-tree; the snaky glen, where</p>
<p>the alders stretch their arms far out across the stream; the meadow</p>
<p>reach, where the trout are fat and silvery, and will only rise about</p>
<p>sunrise or sundown, unless the day is cloudy; the NaiadÔøΩÔøΩs Elbow,</p>
<p>where the brook rounds itself, smooth and dimpled, to embrace a</p>
<p>cluster of pink laurel-bushes.  All these I know; yes, and almost</p>
<p>every current and eddy and backwater I know long before I come to</p>
<p>it.  I remember where I caught the big trout the first year I came</p>
<p>to the stream; and where I lost a bigger one.  I remember the pool</p>
<p>where there were plenty of good fish last year, and wonder whether</p>
<p>they are there now.</p>
<p>Better things than these I remember: the companions with whom I have</p>
<p>followed the stream in days long past; the rendezvous with a comrade</p>
<p>at the place where the rustic bridge crosses the brook; the hours of</p>
<p>sweet converse beside the friendship-fire; the meeting at twilight</p>
<p>with my lady Graygown and the children, who have come down by the</p>
<p>wood-road to walk home with me.</p>
<p>Surely it is pleasant to follow an old stream.  Flowers grow along</p>
<p>its banks which are not to be found anywhere else in the wide world.</p>
<p>&quot;There is rosemary, that ÔøΩÔøΩs for remembrance; and there is pansies,</p>
<p>that ÔøΩÔøΩs for thoughts!&quot;</p>
<p>One May evening, a couple of years since, I was angling in the</p>
<p>Swiftwater, and came upon Joseph Jefferson, stretched out on a large</p>
<p>rock in midstream, and casting the fly down a long pool.  He had</p>
<p>passed the threescore years and ten, but he was as eager and as</p>
<p>happy as a boy in his fishing.</p>
<p>&quot;You here!&quot; I cried.  &quot;What good fortune brought you into these</p>
<p>waters?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; he answered, &quot;I fished this brook forty-five years ago.  It</p>
<p>was in the Paradise Valley that I first thought of Rip Van Winkle.</p>
<p>I wanted to come back again for the sake of old times.&quot;</p>
<p>But what has all this to do with an open fire?  I will tell you.  It</p>
<p>is at the places along the stream, where the little flames of love</p>
<p>and friendship have been kindled in bygone days, that the past</p>
<p>returns most vividly.  These are the altars of remembrance.</p>
<p>It is strange how long a small fire will leave its mark.  The</p>
<p>charred sticks, the black coals, do not decay easily.  If they lie</p>
<p>well up the hank, out of reach of the spring floods, they will stay</p>
<p>there for years.  If you have chanced to build a rough fireplace of</p>
<p>stones from the brook, it seems almost as if it would last forever.</p>
<p>There is a mossy knoll beneath a great butternut-tree on the</p>
<p>Swiftwater where such a fireplace was built four years ago; and</p>
<p>whenever I come to that place now I lay the rod aside, and sit down</p>
<p>for a little while by the fast-flowing water, and remember.</p>
<p>This is what I see: A man wading up the stream, with a creel over</p>
<p>his shoulder, and perhaps a dozen trout in it; two little lads in</p>
<p>gray corduroys running down the path through the woods to meet him,</p>
<p>one carrying a frying-pan and a kettle, the other with a basket of</p>
<p>lunch on his arm.  Then I see the bright flames leaping up in the</p>
<p>fireplace, and hear the trout sizzling in the pan, and smell the</p>
<p>appetizing odour.  Now I see the lads coming back across the foot-</p>
<p>bridge that spans the stream, with a bottle of milk from the nearest</p>
<p>farmhouse.  They are laughing and teetering as they balance along</p>
<p>the single plank.  Now the table is spread on the moss.  How good</p>
<p>the lunch tastes!  Never were there such pink-fleshed trout, such</p>
<p>crisp and savoury slices of broiled bacon.  Douglas, (the beloved</p>
<p>doll that the younger lad shamefacedly brings out from the pocket of</p>
<p>his jacket,) must certainly have some of it.  And after the lunch is</p>
<p>finished, and the birdÔøΩÔøΩs portion has been scattered on the moss, we</p>
<p>creep carefully on our hands and knees to the edge of the brook, and</p>
<p>look over the bank at the big trout that is poising himself in the</p>
<p>amber water.  We have tried a dozen times to catch him, but never</p>
<p>succeeded.  The next time, perhaps--</p>
<p>Well, the fireplace is still standing.  The butternut-tree spreads</p>
<p>its broad branches above the stream.  The violets and the bishopÔøΩÔøΩs-</p>
<p>caps and the wild anemones are sprinkled over the banks.  The</p>
<p>yellow-throat and the water-thrush and the vireos still sing the</p>
<p>same tunes in the thicket.  And the elder of the two lads often</p>
<p>comes back with me to that pleasant place and shares my fishermanÔøΩÔøΩs</p>
<p>luck beside the Swiftwater.</p>
<p>But the younger lad?</p>
<p>Ah, my little Barney, you have gone to follow a new stream,--clear</p>
<p>as crystal,--flowing through fields of wonderful flowers that never</p>
<p>fade.  It is a strange river to Teddy and me; strange and very far</p>
<p>away.  Some day we shall see it with you; and you will teach us the</p>
<p>names of those blossoms that do not wither.  But till then, little</p>
<p>Barney, the other lad and I will follow the old stream that flows by</p>
<p>the woodland fireplace,--your altar.</p>
<p>Rue grows here.  Yes, there is plenty of rue.  But there is also</p>
<p>rosemary, that ÔøΩÔøΩs for remembrance!  And close beside it I see a</p>
<p>little heartÔøΩÔøΩs-ease.</p>
<p>A SLUMBER SONG</p>
<p>FOR THE FISHERMAN&#x27;S CHILD</p>
<p>Furl your sail, my little boatie;</p>
