<p>by Voltaire (Francois Marie Arouet)</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Francois Marie Arouet, who called himself Voltaire, was the son of</p>
<p>Francois Arouet of Poitou, who lived in Paris, had given up his</p>
<p>office of notary two years before the birth of this his third son,</p>
<p>and obtained some years afterwards a treasurer&#x27;s office in the</p>
<p>Chambre des Comptes.  Voltaire was born in the year 1694.  He lived</p>
<p>until within ten or eleven years of the outbreak of the Great French</p>
<p>Revolution, and was a chief leader in the movement of thought that</p>
<p>preceded the Revolution.  Though he lived to his eighty-fourth year,</p>
<p>Voltaire was born with a weak body.  His brother Armand, eight years</p>
<p>his senior, became a Jansenist.  Voltaire when ten years old was</p>
<p>placed with the Jesuits in the College Louis-le-Grand.  There he was</p>
<p>taught during seven years, and his genius was encouraged in its bent</p>
<p>for literature; skill in speaking and in writing being especially</p>
<p>fostered in the system of education which the Jesuits had planned to</p>
<p>produce capable men who by voice and pen could give a reason for the</p>
<p>faith they held.  Verses written for an invalid soldier at the age</p>
<p>of eleven won for young Voltaire the friendship of Ninon l&#x27;Enclos,</p>
<p>who encouraged him to go on writing verses.  She died soon</p>
<p>afterwards, and remembered him with a legacy of two thousand livres</p>
<p>for purchase of books.  He wrote in his lively school-days a tragedy</p>
<p>that afterwards he burnt.  At the age of seventeen he left the</p>
<p>College Louis-le-Grand, where he said afterwards that he had been</p>
<p>taught nothing but Latin and the Stupidities.  He was then sent to</p>
<p>the law schools, and saw life in Paris as a gay young poet who, with</p>
<p>all his brilliant liveliness, had an aptitude for looking on the</p>
<p>tragic side of things, and one of whose first poems was an &quot;Ode on</p>
<p>the Misfortunes of Life.&quot;  His mother died when he was twenty.</p>
<p>Voltaire&#x27;s father thought him a fool for his versifying, and</p>
<p>attached him as secretary to the Marquis of Chateauneuf; when he</p>
<p>went as ambassador to the Hague.  In December, 1713, he was</p>
<p>dismissed for his irregularities.  In Paris his unsteadiness and his</p>
<p>addiction to literature caused his father to rejoice in getting him</p>
<p>housed in a country chateau with M. de Caumartin.  M. de Caumartin&#x27;s</p>
<p>father talked with such enthusiasm of Henri IV. and Sully that</p>
<p>Voltaire planned the writing of what became his Henriade, and his</p>
<p>&quot;History of the Age of Louis XIV.,&quot; who died on the 1st of</p>
<p>September, 1715.</p>
<p>Under the regency that followed, Voltaire got into trouble again and</p>
<p>again through the sharpness of his pen, and at last, accused of</p>
<p>verse that satirised the Regent, he was locked up--on the 17th of</p>
<p>May, 1717--in the Bastille.  There he wrote the first two books of</p>
<p>his Henriade, and finished a play on OEdipus, which he had begun at</p>
<p>the age of eighteen.  He did not obtain full liberty until the 12th</p>
<p>of April, 1718, and it was at this time--with a clearly formed</p>
<p>design to associate the name he took with work of high attempt in</p>
<p>literature--that Francois Marie Arouet, aged twenty-four, first</p>
<p>called himself Voltaire.</p>
<p>Voltaire&#x27;s OEdipe was played with success in November, 1718.  A few</p>
<p>months later he was again banished from Paris, and finished the</p>
<p>Henriade in his retirement, as well as another play, Artemise, that</p>
<p>was acted in February, 1720.  Other plays followed.  In December,</p>
<p>1721, Voltaire visited Lord Bolingbroke, who was then an exile from</p>
<p>England, at the Chateau of La Source.  There was now constant</p>
<p>literary activity.  From July to October, 1722, Voltaire visited</p>
<p>Holland with Madame de Rupelmonde.  After a serious attack of small-</p>
<p>pox in November, 1723, Voltaire was active as a poet about the</p>
<p>Court.  He was then in receipt of a pension of two thousand livres</p>
<p>from the king, and had inherited more than twice as much by the</p>
<p>death of his father in January, 1722.  But in December, 1725, a</p>
<p>quarrel, fastened upon him by the Chevalier de Rohan, who had him</p>
<p>waylaid and beaten, caused him to send a challenge.  For this he was</p>
<p>arrested and lodged once more, in April, 1726, in the Bastille.</p>
<p>There he was detained a month; and his first act when he was</p>
<p>released was to ask for a passport to England.</p>
<p>Voltaire left France, reached London in August, 1726, went as guest</p>
<p>to the house of a rich merchant at Wandsworth, and remained three</p>
<p>years in this country, from the age of thirty-two to the age of</p>
<p>thirty-five.  He was here when George I. died, and George II. became</p>
<p>king.  He published here his Henriade.  He wrote here his &quot;History</p>
<p>of Charles XII.&quot;  He read &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; as a new book, and</p>
<p>might have been present at the first night of The Beggar&#x27;s Opera.</p>
<p>He was here whet Sir Isaac Newton died.</p>
<p>In 1731 he published at Rouen the Lettres sur les Anglais, which</p>
<p>appeared in England in 1733 in the volume from which they are here</p>
<p>reprinted.</p>
<p>H.M.</p>
<p>LETTERS ON ENGLAND</p>
<p>LETTER I.--ON THE QUAKERS</p>
<p>I was of opinion that the doctrine and history of so extraordinary a</p>
<p>people were worthy the attention of the curious.  To acquaint myself</p>
<p>with them I made a visit to one of the most eminent Quakers in</p>
<p>England, who, after having traded thirty years, had the wisdom to</p>
<p>prescribe limits to his fortune and to his desires, and was settled</p>
<p>in a little solitude not far from London.  Being come into it, I</p>
<p>perceived a small but regularly built house, vastly neat, but</p>
<p>without the least pomp of furniture.  The Quaker who owned it was a</p>
<p>hale, ruddy-complexioned old man, who had never been afflicted with</p>
<p>sickness because he had always been insensible to passions, and a</p>
<p>perfect stranger to intemperance.  I never in my life saw a more</p>
<p>noble or a more engaging aspect than his.  He was dressed like those</p>
<p>of his persuasion, in a plain coat without pleats in the sides, or</p>
<p>buttons on the pockets and sleeves; and had on a beaver, the brims</p>
<p>of which were horizontal like those of our clergy.  He did not</p>
<p>uncover himself when I appeared, and advanced towards me without</p>
<p>once stooping his body; but there appeared more politeness in the</p>
<p>open, humane air of his countenance, than in the custom of drawing</p>
<p>one leg behind the other, and taking that from the head which is</p>
<p>made to cover it.  &quot;Friend,&quot; says he to me, &quot;I perceive thou art a</p>
<p>stranger, but if I can do anything for thee, only tell me.&quot;  &quot;Sir,&quot;</p>
<p>said I to him, bending forwards and advancing, as is usual with us,</p>
<p>one leg towards him, &quot;I flatter myself that my just curiosity will</p>
<p>not give you the least offence, and that you&#x27;ll do me the honour to</p>
<p>inform me of the particulars of your religion.&quot;  &quot;The people of thy</p>
<p>country,&quot; replied the Quaker, &quot;are too full of their bows and</p>
<p>compliments, but I never yet met with one of them who had so much</p>
<p>curiosity as thyself.  Come in, and let us first dine together.&quot;  I</p>
<p>still continued to make some very unseasonable ceremonies, it not</p>
<p>being easy to disengage one&#x27;s self at once from habits we have been</p>
<p>long used to; and after taking part in a frugal meal, which began</p>
<p>and ended with a prayer to God, I began to question my courteous</p>
<p>host.  I opened with that which good Catholics have more than once</p>
<p>made to Huguenots.  &quot;My dear sir,&quot; said I, &quot;were you ever baptised?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never was,&quot; replied the Quaker, &quot;nor any of my brethren.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zounds!&quot; say I to him, &quot;you are not Christians, then.&quot;  &quot;Friend,&quot;</p>
<p>replies the old man in a soft tone of voice, &quot;swear not; we are</p>
<p>Christians, and endeavour to be good Christians, but we are not of</p>
<p>opinion that the sprinkling water on a child&#x27;s head makes him a</p>
<p>Christian.&quot;  &quot;Heavens!&quot; say I, shocked at his impiety, &quot;you have</p>
<p>then forgot that Christ was baptised by St. John.&quot;  &quot;Friend,&quot;</p>
<p>replies the mild Quaker once again, &quot;swear not; Christ indeed was</p>
<p>baptised by John, but He himself never baptised anyone.  We are the</p>
<p>disciples of Christ, not of John.&quot;  I pitied very much the sincerity</p>
<p>of my worthy Quaker, and was absolutely for forcing him to get</p>
<p>himself christened.  &quot;Were that all,&quot; replied he very gravely, &quot;we</p>
<p>would submit cheerfully to baptism, purely in compliance with thy</p>
<p>weakness, for we don&#x27;t condemn any person who uses it; but then we</p>
<p>think that those who profess a religion of so holy, so spiritual a</p>
<p>nature as that of Christ, ought to abstain to the utmost of their</p>
<p>power from the Jewish ceremonies.&quot;  &quot;O unaccountable!&quot; say I:</p>
<p>&quot;what! baptism a Jewish ceremony?&quot;  &quot;Yes, my friend,&quot; says he, &quot;so</p>
<p>truly Jewish, that a great many Jews use the baptism of John to this</p>
<p>day.  Look into ancient authors, and thou wilt find that John only</p>
<p>revived this practice; and that it had been used by the Hebrews,</p>
<p>long before his time, in like manner as the Mahometans imitated the</p>
<p>Ishmaelites in their pilgrimages to Mecca.  Jesus indeed submitted</p>
<p>to the baptism of John, as He had suffered Himself to be</p>
<p>circumcised; but circumcision and the washing with water ought to be</p>
<p>abolished by the baptism of Christ, that baptism of the Spirit, that</p>
<p>ablution of the soul, which is the salvation of mankind.  Thus the</p>
<p>forerunner said, &#x27;I indeed baptise you with water unto repentance;</p>
<p>but He that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not</p>
<p>worthy to bear:  he shall baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with</p>
<p>fire.&#x27;  Likewise Paul, the great apostle of the Gentiles, writes as</p>
<p>follows to the Corinthians, &#x27;Christ sent me not to baptise, but to</p>
<p>preach the Gospel;&#x27; and indeed Paul never baptised but two persons</p>
<p>with water, and that very much against his inclinations.  He</p>
<p>circumcised his disciple Timothy, and the other disciples likewise</p>
<p>circumcised all who were willing to submit to that carnal ordinance.</p>
<p>But art thou circumcised?&quot; added he.  &quot;I have not the honour to be</p>
<p>so,&quot; say I.  &quot;Well, friend,&quot; continues the Quaker, &quot;thou art a</p>
<p>Christian without being circumcised, and I am one without being</p>
<p>baptised.&quot;  Thus did this pious man make a wrong but very specious</p>
<p>application of four or five texts of Scripture which seemed to</p>
<p>favour the tenets of his sect; but at the same time forgot very</p>
<p>sincerely an hundred texts which made directly against them.  I had</p>
<p>more sense than to contest with him, since there is no possibility</p>
<p>of convincing an enthusiast.  A man should never pretend to inform a</p>
<p>lover of his mistress&#x27;s faults, no more than one who is at law, of</p>
<p>the badness of his cause; nor attempt to win over a fanatic by</p>
<p>strength of reasoning.  Accordingly I waived the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said I to him, &quot;what sort of a communion have you?&quot;  &quot;We</p>
<p>have none like that thou hintest at among us,&quot; replied he.  &quot;How! no</p>
<p>communion?&quot; said I.  &quot;Only that spiritual one,&quot; replied he, &quot;of</p>
<p>hearts.&quot;  He then began again to throw out his texts of Scripture;</p>
<p>and preached a most eloquent sermon against that ordinance.  He</p>
<p>harangued in a tone as though he had been inspired, to prove that</p>
<p>the sacraments were merely of human invention, and that the word</p>
<p>&quot;sacrament&quot; was not once mentioned in the Gospel.  &quot;Excuse,&quot; said</p>
<p>he, &quot;my ignorance, for I have not employed a hundredth part of the</p>
<p>arguments which might be brought to prove the truth of our religion,</p>
<p>but these thou thyself mayest peruse in the Exposition of our Faith</p>
<p>written by Robert Barclay.  It is one of the best pieces that ever</p>
<p>was penned by man; and as our adversaries confess it to be of</p>
<p>dangerous tendency, the arguments in it must necessarily be very</p>
<p>convincing.&quot;  I promised to peruse this piece, and my Quaker</p>
<p>imagined he had already made a convert of me.  He afterwards gave me</p>
<p>an account in few words of some singularities which make this sect</p>
<p>the contempt of others.  &quot;Confess,&quot; said he, &quot;that it was very</p>
<p>difficult for thee to refrain from laughter, when I answered all thy</p>
<p>civilities without uncovering my head, and at the same time said</p>
<p>&#x27;thee&#x27; and &#x27;thou&#x27; to thee.  However, thou appearest to me too well</p>
<p>read not to know that in Christ&#x27;s time no nation was so ridiculous</p>
<p>as to put the plural number for the singular.  Augustus Caesar</p>
<p>himself was spoken to in such phrases as these:  &#x27;I love thee,&#x27; &#x27;I</p>
<p>beseech thee,&#x27; &#x27;I thank thee;&#x27; but he did not allow any person to</p>
<p>call him &#x27;Domine,&#x27; sir.  It was not till many ages after that men</p>
<p>would have the word &#x27;you,&#x27; as though they were double, instead of</p>
<p>&#x27;thou&#x27; employed in speaking to them; and usurped the flattering</p>
<p>titles of lordship, of eminence, and of holiness, which mere worms</p>
<p>bestow on other worms by assuring them that they are with a most</p>
<p>profound respect, and an infamous falsehood, their most obedient</p>
<p>humble servants.  It is to secure ourselves more strongly from such</p>
<p>a shameless traffic of lies and flattery, that we &#x27;thee&#x27; and &#x27;thou&#x27;</p>
<p>a king with the same freedom as we do a beggar, and salute no</p>
<p>person; we owing nothing to mankind but charity, and to the laws</p>
<p>respect and obedience.</p>
<p>&quot;Our apparel is also somewhat different from that of others, and</p>
<p>this purely, that it may be a perpetual warning to us not to imitate</p>
<p>them.  Others wear the badges and marks of their several dignities,</p>
<p>and we those of Christian humility.  We fly from all assemblies of</p>
<p>pleasure, from diversions of every kind, and from places where</p>
<p>gaming is practised; and indeed our case would be very deplorable,</p>
<p>should we fill with such levities as those I have mentioned the</p>
<p>heart which ought to be the habitation of God.  We never swear, not</p>
<p>even in a court of justice, being of opinion that the most holy name</p>
<p>of God ought not to be prostituted in the miserable contests betwixt</p>
<p>man and man.  When we are obliged to appear before a magistrate upon</p>
<p>other people&#x27;s account (for law-suits are unknown among the</p>
<p>Friends), we give evidence to the truth by sealing it with our yea</p>
<p>or nay; and the judges believe us on our bare affirmation, whilst so</p>
<p>many other Christians forswear themselves on the holy Gospels.  We</p>
<p>never war or fight in any case; but it is not that we are afraid,</p>
<p>for so far from shuddering at the thoughts of death, we on the</p>
<p>contrary bless the moment which unites us with the Being of Beings;</p>
<p>but the reason of our not using the outward sword is, that we are</p>
<p>neither wolves, tigers, nor mastiffs, but men and Christians.  Our</p>
<p>God, who has commanded us to love our enemies, and to suffer without</p>
<p>repining, would certainly not permit us to cross the seas, merely</p>
<p>because murderers clothed in scarlet, and wearing caps two foot</p>
<p>high, enlist citizens by a noise made with two little sticks on an</p>
<p>ass&#x27;s skin extended.  And when, after a victory is gained, the whole</p>
<p>city of London is illuminated; when the sky is in a blaze with</p>
<p>fireworks, and a noise is heard in the air, of thanksgivings, of</p>
<p>bells, of organs, and of the cannon, we groan in silence, and are</p>
<p>deeply affected with sadness of spirit and brokenness of heart, for</p>
<p>the sad havoc which is the occasion of those public rejoicings.&quot;</p>
<p>LETTER II.--ON THE QUAKERS</p>
<p>Such was the substance of the conversation I had with this very</p>
<p>singular person; but I was greatly surprised to see him come the</p>
<p>Sunday following and take me with him to the Quakers&#x27; meeting.</p>
<p>There are several of these in London, but that which he carried me</p>
<p>to stands near the famous pillar called The Monument.  The brethren</p>
<p>were already assembled at my entering it with my guide.  There might</p>
<p>be about four hundred men and three hundred women in the meeting.</p>
<p>The women hid their faces behind their fans, and the men were</p>
<p>covered with their broad-brimmed hats.  All were seated, and the</p>
<p>silence was universal.  I passed through them, but did not perceive</p>
<p>so much as one lift up his eyes to look at me.  This silence lasted</p>
<p>a quarter of an hour, when at last one of them rose up, took off his</p>
<p>hat, and, after making a variety of wry faces and groaning in a most</p>
<p>lamentable manner, he, partly from his nose and partly from his</p>
<p>mouth, threw out a strange, confused jumble of words (borrowed, as</p>
<p>he imagined, from the Gospel) which neither himself nor any of his</p>
<p>hearers understood.  When this distorter had ended his beautiful</p>
<p>soliloquy, and that the stupid, but greatly edified, congregation</p>
<p>were separated, I asked my friend how it was possible for the</p>
<p>judicious part of their assembly to suffer such a babbling?  &quot;We are</p>
<p>obliged,&quot; says he, &quot;to suffer it, because no one knows when a man</p>
<p>rises up to hold forth whether he will be moved by the Spirit or by</p>
<p>folly.  In this doubt and uncertainty we listen patiently to</p>
<p>everyone; we even allow our women to hold forth.  Two or three of</p>
<p>these are often inspired at one and the same time, and it is then</p>
<p>that a most charming noise is heard in the Lord&#x27;s house.&quot;  &quot;You</p>
<p>have, then, no priests?&quot; say I to him.  &quot;No, no, friend,&quot; replies</p>
<p>the Quaker, &quot;to our great happiness.&quot;  Then opening one of the</p>
<p>Friends&#x27; books, as he called it, he read the following words in an</p>
<p>emphatic tone:- &quot;&#x27;God forbid we should presume to ordain anyone to</p>
<p>receive the Holy Spirit on the Lord&#x27;s Day to the prejudice of the</p>
<p>rest of the brethren.&#x27;  Thanks to the Almighty, we are the only</p>
<p>people upon earth that have no priests.  Wouldst thou deprive us of</p>
<p>so happy a distinction?  Why should we abandon our babe to mercenary</p>
<p>nurses, when we ourselves have milk enough for it?  These mercenary</p>
<p>creatures would soon domineer in our houses and destroy both the</p>
<p>mother and the babe.  God has said, &#x27;Freely you have received,</p>
<p>freely give.&#x27;  Shall we, after these words, cheapen, as it were, the</p>
<p>Gospel, sell the Holy Ghost, and make of an assembly of Christians a</p>
<p>mere shop of traders?  We don&#x27;t pay a set of men clothed in black to</p>
<p>assist our poor, to bury our dead, or to preach to the brethren.</p>
<p>These offices are all of too tender a nature for us ever to entrust</p>
<p>them to others.&quot;  &quot;But how is it possible for you,&quot; said I, with</p>
<p>some warmth, &quot;to know whether your discourse is really inspired by</p>
<p>the Almighty?&quot;  &quot;Whosoever,&quot; says he, &quot;shall implore Christ to</p>
<p>enlighten him, and shall publish the Gospel truths he may feel</p>
<p>inwardly, such an one may be assured that he is inspired by the</p>
<p>Lord.&quot;  He then poured forth a numberless multitude of Scripture</p>
<p>texts which proved, as he imagined, that there is no such thing as</p>
<p>Christianity without an immediate revelation, and added these</p>
<p>remarkable words:  &quot;When thou movest one of thy limbs, is it moved</p>
<p>by thy own power?  Certainly not; for this limb is often sensible to</p>
<p>involuntary motions.  Consequently he who created thy body gives</p>
<p>motion to this earthly tabernacle.  And are the several ideas of</p>
<p>which thy soul receives the impression formed by thyself?  Much less</p>
<p>are they, since these pour in upon thy mind whether thou wilt or no;</p>
<p>consequently thou receivest thy ideas from Him who created thy soul.</p>
<p>But as He leaves thy affections at full liberty, He gives thy mind</p>
<p>such ideas as thy affections may deserve; if thou livest in God,</p>
<p>thou actest, thou thinkest in God.  After this thou needest only but</p>
<p>open thine eyes to that light which enlightens all mankind, and it</p>
<p>is then thou wilt perceive the truth, and make others perceive it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, this,&quot; said I, &quot;is Malebranche&#x27;s doctrine to a tittle.&quot;  &quot;I am</p>
<p>acquainted with thy Malebranche,&quot; said he; &quot;he had something of the</p>
<p>Friend in him, but was not enough so.&quot;  These are the most</p>
<p>considerable particulars I learnt concerning the doctrine of the</p>
<p>Quakers.  In my next letter I shall acquaint you with their history,</p>
<p>which you will find more singular than their opinions.</p>
<p>LETTER III.--ON THE QUAKERS</p>
<p>You have already heard that the Quakers date from Christ, who,</p>
<p>according to them, was the first Quaker.  Religion, say these, was</p>
<p>corrupted a little after His death, and remained in that state of</p>
<p>corruption about sixteen hundred years.  But there were always a few</p>
<p>Quakers concealed in the world, who carefully preserved the sacred</p>
<p>fire, which was extinguished in all but themselves, until at last</p>
<p>this light spread itself in England in 1642.</p>
<p>It was at the time when Great Britain was torn to pieces by the</p>
<p>intestine wars which three or four sects had raised in the name of</p>
<p>God, that one George Fox, born in Leicestershire, and son to a silk-</p>
<p>weaver, took it into his head to preach, and, as he pretended, with</p>
<p>all the requisites of a true apostle--that is, without being able</p>
<p>either to read or write.  He was about twenty-five years of age,</p>
<p>irreproachable in his life and conduct, and a holy madman.  He was</p>
<p>equipped in leather from head to foot, and travelled from one</p>
<p>village to another, exclaiming against war and the clergy.  Had his</p>
<p>invectives been levelled against the soldiery only he would have</p>
<p>been safe enough, but he inveighed against ecclesiastics.  Fox was</p>
<p>seized at Derby, and being carried before a justice of peace, he did</p>
<p>not once offer to pull off his leathern hat, upon which an officer</p>
<p>gave him a great box of the ear, and cried to him, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know</p>
<p>you are to appear uncovered before his worship?&quot;  Fox presented his</p>
<p>other cheek to the officer, and begged him to give him another box</p>
<p>for God&#x27;s sake.  The justice would have had him sworn before he</p>
<p>asked him any questions.  &quot;Know, friend,&quot; says Fox to him, &quot;that I</p>
<p>never swear.&quot;  The justice, observing he &quot;thee&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;thou&#x27;d&quot; him,</p>
<p>sent him to the House of Correction, in Derby, with orders that he</p>
<p>should be whipped there.  Fox praised the Lord all the way he went</p>
<p>to the House of Correction, where the justice&#x27;s order was executed</p>
<p>with the utmost severity.  The men who whipped this enthusiast were</p>
<p>greatly surprised to hear him beseech them to give him a few more</p>
<p>lashes for the good of his soul.  There was no need of entreating</p>
<p>these people; the lashes were repeated, for which Fox thanked them</p>
<p>very cordially, and began to preach.  At first the spectators fell</p>
<p>a-laughing, but they afterwards listened to him; and as enthusiasm</p>
<p>is an epidemical distemper, many were persuaded, and those who</p>
<p>scourged him became his first disciples.  Being set at liberty, he</p>
<p>ran up and down the country with a dozen proselytes at his heels,</p>
<p>still declaiming against the clergy, and was whipped from time to</p>
<p>time.  Being one day set in the pillory, he harangued the crowd in</p>
<p>so strong and moving a manner, that fifty of the auditors became his</p>
<p>converts, and he won the rest so much in his favour that, his head</p>
<p>being freed tumultuously from the hole where it was fastened, the</p>
<p>populace went and searched for the Church of England clergyman who</p>
<p>had been chiefly instrumental in bringing him to this punishment,</p>
<p>and set him on the same pillory where Fox had stood.</p>
<p>Fox was bold enough to convert some of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers,</p>
<p>who thereupon quitted the service and refused to take the oaths.</p>
<p>Oliver, having as great a contempt for a sect which would not allow</p>
<p>its members to fight, as Sixtus Quintus had for another sect, Dove</p>
<p>non si chiamava, began to persecute these new converts.  The prisons</p>
<p>were crowded with them, but persecution seldom has any other effect</p>
<p>than to increase the number of proselytes.  These came, therefore,</p>
<p>from their confinement more strongly confirmed in the principles</p>
<p>they had imbibed, and followed by their gaolers, whom they had</p>
<p>brought over to their belief.  But the circumstances which</p>
<p>contributed chiefly to the spreading of this sect were as follows:-</p>
<p>Fox thought himself inspired, arid consequently was of opinion that</p>
<p>he must speak in a manner different from the rest of mankind.  He</p>
<p>thereupon began to writhe his body, to screw up his face, to hold in</p>
<p>his breath, and to exhale it in a forcible manner, insomuch that the</p>
<p>priestess of the Pythian god at Delphos could not have acted her</p>
<p>part to better advantage.  Inspiration soon became so habitual to</p>
<p>him that he could scarce deliver himself in any other manner.  This</p>
<p>was the first gift he communicated to his disciples.  These aped</p>
<p>very sincerely their master&#x27;s several grimaces, and shook in every</p>
<p>limb the instant the fit of inspiration came upon them, whence they</p>
<p>were called Quakers.  The vulgar attempted to mimic them; they</p>
<p>trembled, they spake through the nose, they quaked and fancied</p>
<p>themselves inspired by the Holy Ghost.  The only thing now wanting</p>
<p>was a few miracles, and accordingly they wrought some.</p>
<p>Fox, this modern patriarch, spoke thus to a justice of peace before</p>
<p>a large assembly of people:  &quot;Friend, take care what thou dost; God</p>
<p>will soon punish thee for persecuting His saints.&quot;  This magistrate,</p>
<p>being one who besotted himself every day with bad beer and brandy,</p>
<p>died of an apoplexy two days after, the moment he had signed a</p>
<p>mittimus for imprisoning some Quakers.  The sudden death with which</p>
<p>this justice was seized was not ascribed to his intemperance, but</p>
<p>was universally looked upon as the effect of the holy man&#x27;s</p>
<p>predictions; so that this accident made more converts to Quakerism</p>
<p>than a thousand sermons and as many shaking fits could have done.</p>
<p>Oliver, finding them increase daily, was desirous of bringing them</p>
<p>over to his party, and for that purpose attempted to bribe them by</p>
<p>money.  However, they were incorruptible, which made him one day</p>
<p>declare that this religion was the only one he had ever met with</p>
<p>that had resisted the charms of gold.</p>
<p>The Quakers were several times persecuted under Charles II.; not</p>
<p>upon a religious account, but for refusing to pay the tithes, for</p>
<p>&quot;theeing&quot; and &quot;thouing&quot; the magistrates, and for refusing to take</p>
<p>the oaths enacted by the laws.</p>
<p>At last Robert Barclay, a native of Scotland, presented to the King,</p>
<p>in 1675, his &quot;Apology for the Quakers,&quot; a work as well drawn up as</p>
<p>the subject could possibly admit.  The dedication to Charles II. is</p>
<p>not filled with mean, flattering encomiums, but abounds with bold</p>
<p>touches in favour of truth and with the wisest counsels.  &quot;Thou hast</p>
<p>tasted,&quot; says he to the King at the close of his epistle dedicatory,</p>
<p>&quot;of prosperity and adversity; thou knowest what it is to be banished</p>
<p>thy native country; to be overruled as well as to rule and sit upon</p>
<p>the throne; and, being oppressed, thou hast reason to know how</p>
<p>hateful the Oppressor is both to God and man.  If, after all these</p>
<p>warnings and advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the Lord with</p>
<p>all thy heart, but forget Him who remembered thee in thy distress,</p>
<p>and give up thyself to follow lust and vanity, surely great will be</p>
<p>thy condemnation.</p>
<p>&quot;Against which snare, as well as the temptation of those that may or</p>
<p>do feed thee and prompt thee to evil, the most excellent and</p>
<p>prevalent remedy will be, to apply thyself to that light of Christ</p>
<p>which shineth in thy conscience, which neither can nor will flatter</p>
<p>thee nor suffer thee to be at ease in thy sins, but doth and will</p>
<p>deal plainly and faithfully with thee, as those that are followers</p>
<p>thereof have plainly done.--Thy faithful friend and subject, Robert</p>
<p>Barclay.&quot;</p>
<p>A more surprising circumstance is, that this epistle, written by a</p>
<p>private man of no figure, was so happy in its effects, as to put a</p>
<p>stop to the persecution.</p>
<p>LETTER IV.--ON THE QUAKERS</p>
<p>About this time arose the illustrious William Penn, who established</p>
<p>the power of the Quakers in America, and would have made them appear</p>
<p>venerable in the eyes of the Europeans, were it possible for mankind</p>
<p>to respect virtue when revealed in a ridiculous light.  He was the</p>
<p>only son of Vice-Admiral Penn, favourite of the Duke of York,</p>
<p>afterwards King James II.</p>
<p>William Penn, at twenty years of age, happening to meet with a</p>
<p>Quaker in Cork, whom he had known at Oxford, this man made a</p>
<p>proselyte of him; and William being a sprightly youth, and naturally</p>
<p>eloquent, having a winning aspect, and a very engaging carriage, he</p>
<p>soon gained over some of his intimates.  He carried matters so far,</p>
<p>that he formed by insensible degrees a society of young Quakers, who</p>
<p>met at his house; so that he was at the head of a sect when a little</p>
<p>above twenty.</p>
<p>Being returned, after his leaving Cork, to the Vice-Admiral his</p>
<p>father, instead of falling upon his knees to ask his blessing, he</p>
<p>went up to him with his hat on, and said, &quot;Friend, I am very glad to</p>
<p>see thee in good health.&quot;  The Vice-Admiral imagined his son to be</p>
<p>crazy, but soon finding he was turned Quaker, he employed all the</p>
<p>methods that prudence could suggest to engage him to behave and act</p>
<p>like other people.  The youth made no other answer to his father,</p>
<p>than by exhorting him to turn Quaker also.  At last his father</p>
<p>confined himself to this single request, viz., &quot;that he should wait</p>
<p>upon the King and the Duke of York with his hat under his arm, and</p>
<p>should not &#x27;thee&#x27; and &#x27;thou&#x27; them.&quot;  William answered, &quot;that he</p>
<p>could not do these things, for conscience&#x27; sake,&quot; which exasperated</p>
<p>his father to such a degree, that he turned him out of doors.  Young</p>
<p>Pen gave God thanks for permitting him to suffer so early in His</p>
<p>cause, after which he went into the city, where he held forth, and</p>
<p>made a great number of converts.</p>
<p>The Church of England clergy found their congregations dwindle away</p>
<p>daily; and Penn being young, handsome, and of a graceful stature,</p>
<p>the court as well as the city ladies flocked very devoutly to his</p>
<p>meeting.  The patriarch, George Fox, hearing of his great</p>
<p>reputation, came to London (though the journey was very long) purely</p>
<p>to see and converse with him.  Both resolved to go upon missions</p>
<p>into foreign countries, and accordingly they embarked for Holland,</p>
<p>after having left labourers sufficient to take care of the London</p>
<p>vineyard.</p>
<p>Their labours were crowned with success in Amsterdam, but a</p>
<p>circumstance which reflected the greatest honour on them, and at the</p>
<p>same time put their humility to the greatest trial, was the</p>
<p>reception they met with from Elizabeth, the Princess Palatine, aunt</p>
<p>to George I. of Great Britain, a lady conspicuous for her genius and</p>
<p>knowledge, and to whom Descartes had dedicated his Philosophical</p>
<p>Romance.</p>
<p>She was then retired to the Hague, where she received these Friends,</p>
<p>for so the Quakers were at that time called in Holland.  This</p>
<p>princess had several conferences with them in her palace, and she at</p>
<p>last entertained so favourable an opinion of Quakerism, that they</p>
<p>confessed she was not far from the kingdom of heaven.  The Friends</p>
<p>sowed likewise the good seed in Germany, but reaped very little</p>
<p>fruit; for the mode of &quot;theeing&quot; and &quot;thouing&quot; was not approved of</p>
<p>in a country where a man is perpetually obliged to employ the titles</p>
<p>of &quot;highness&quot; and &quot;excellency.&quot;  William Penn returned soon to</p>
<p>England upon hearing of his father&#x27;s sickness, in order to see him</p>
<p>before he died.  The Vice-Admiral was reconciled to his son, and</p>
<p>though of a different persuasion, embraced him tenderly.  William</p>
<p>made a fruitless exhortation to his father not to receive the</p>
<p>sacrament, but to die a Quaker, and the good old man entreated his</p>
<p>son William to wear buttons on his sleeves, and a crape hatband in</p>
<p>his beaver, but all to no purpose.</p>
<p>William Penn inherited very large possessions, part of which</p>
<p>consisted in Crown debts due to the Vice-Admiral for sums he had</p>
<p>advanced for the sea service.  No moneys were at that time more</p>
<p>insecure than those owing from the king.  Penn was obliged to go</p>
<p>more than once, and &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; King Charles and his</p>
<p>Ministers, in order to recover the debt; and at last, instead of</p>
<p>specie, the Government invested him with the right and sovereignty</p>
<p>of a province of America, to the south of Maryland.  Thus was a</p>
<p>Quaker raised to sovereign power.  Penn set sail for his new</p>
<p>dominions with two ships freighted with Quakers, who followed his</p>
<p>fortune.  The country was then called Pennsylvania from William</p>
<p>Penn, who there founded Philadelphia, now the most flourishing city</p>
<p>in that country.  The first step he took was to enter into an</p>
<p>alliance with his American neighbours, and this is the only treaty</p>
<p>between those people and the Christians that was not ratified by an</p>
<p>oath, and was never infringed.  The new sovereign was at the same</p>
<p>time the legislator of Pennsylvania, and enacted very wise and</p>
<p>prudent laws, none of which have ever been changed since his time.</p>
<p>The first is, to injure no person upon a religious account, and to</p>
<p>consider as brethren all those who believe in one God.</p>
<p>He had no sooner settled his government, but several American</p>
<p>merchants came and peopled this colony.  The natives of the country,</p>
<p>instead of flying into the woods, cultivated by insensible degrees a</p>
<p>friendship with the peaceable Quakers.  They loved these foreigners</p>
<p>as much as they detested the other Christians who had conquered and</p>
<p>laid waste America.  In a little time a great number of these</p>
<p>savages (falsely so called), charmed with the mild and gentle</p>
<p>disposition of their neighbours, came in crowds to William Penn, and</p>
<p>besought him to admit them into the number of his vassals.  It was</p>
<p>very rare and uncommon for a sovereign to be &quot;thee&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;thou&#x27;d&quot;</p>
<p>by the meanest of his subjects, who never took their hats off when</p>
<p>they came into his presence; and as singular for a Government to be</p>
<p>without one priest in it, and for a people to be without arms,</p>
<p>either offensive or defensive; for a body of citizens to be</p>
<p>absolutely undistinguished but by the public employments, and for</p>
<p>neighbours not to entertain the least jealousy one against the</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>William Penn might glory in having brought down upon earth the so</p>
<p>much boasted golden age, which in all probability never existed but</p>
<p>in Pennsylvania.  He returned to England to settle some affairs</p>
<p>relating to his new dominions.  After the death of King Charles II.,</p>
<p>King James, who had loved the father, indulged the same affection to</p>
<p>the son, and no longer considered him as an obscure sectary, but as</p>
<p>a very great man.  The king&#x27;s politics on this occasion agreed with</p>
<p>his inclinations.  He was desirous of pleasing the Quakers by</p>
<p>annulling the laws made against Nonconformists, in order to have an</p>
<p>opportunity, by this universal toleration, of establishing the</p>
<p>Romish religion.  All the sectarists in England saw the snare that</p>
<p>was laid for them, but did not give into it; they never failing to</p>
<p>unite when the Romish religion, their common enemy, is to be</p>
<p>opposed.  But Penn did not think himself bound in any manner to</p>
<p>renounce his principles, merely to favour Protestants to whom he was</p>
<p>odious, in opposition to a king who loved him.  He had established a</p>
<p>universal toleration with regard to conscience in America, and would</p>
<p>not have it thought that he intended to destroy it in Europe, for</p>
<p>which reason he adhered so inviolably to King James, that a report</p>
<p>prevailed universally of his being a Jesuit.  This calumny affected</p>
<p>him very strongly, and he was obliged to justify himself in print.</p>
<p>However, the unfortunate King James II., in whom, as in most princes</p>
<p>of the Stuart family, grandeur and weakness were equally blended,</p>
<p>and who, like them, as much overdid some things as he was short in</p>
<p>others, lost his kingdom in a manner that is hardly to be accounted</p>
<p>for.</p>
<p>All the English sectarists accepted from William III, and his</p>
<p>Parliament the toleration and indulgence which they had refused when</p>
<p>offered by King James.  It was then the Quakers began to enjoy, by</p>
<p>virtue of the laws, the several privileges they possess at this</p>
<p>time.  Penn having at last seen Quakerism firmly established in his</p>
<p>native country, went back to Pennsylvania.  His own people and the</p>
<p>Americans received him with tears of joy, as though he had been a</p>
<p>father who was returned to visit his children.  All the laws had</p>
<p>been religiously observed in his absence, a circumstance in which no</p>
<p>legislator had ever been happy but himself.  After having resided</p>
<p>some years in Pennsylvania he left it, but with great reluctance, in</p>
<p>order to return to England, there to solicit some matters in favour</p>
<p>of the commerce of Pennsylvania.  But he never saw it again, he</p>
<p>dying in Ruscombe, in Berkshire, in 1718.</p>
<p>I am not able to guess what fate Quakerism may have in America, but</p>
<p>I perceive it dwindles away daily in England.  In all countries</p>
<p>where liberty of conscience is allowed, the established religion</p>
<p>will at last swallow up all the rest.  Quakers are disqualified from</p>
<p>being members of Parliament; nor can they enjoy any post or</p>
<p>preferment, because an oath must always be taken on these occasions,</p>
<p>and they never swear.  They are therefore reduced to the necessity</p>
<p>of subsisting upon traffic.  Their children, whom the industry of</p>
<p>their parents has enriched, are desirous of enjoying honours, of</p>
<p>wearing buttons and ruffles; and quite ashamed of being called</p>
<p>Quakers they become converts to the Church of England, merely to be</p>
<p>in the fashion.</p>
<p>LETTER V.--ON THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND</p>
<p>England is properly the country of sectarists.  Multae sunt</p>
<p>mansiones in domo patris mei (in my Father&#x27;s house are many</p>
<p>mansions).  An Englishman, as one to whom liberty is natural, may go</p>
<p>to heaven his own way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, though every one is permitted to serve God in whatever</p>
<p>mode or fashion he thinks proper, yet their true religion, that in</p>
<p>which a man makes his fortune, is the sect of Episcopalians or</p>
<p>Churchmen, called the Church of England, or simply the Church, by</p>
<p>way of eminence.  No person can possess an employment either in</p>
<p>England or Ireland unless he be ranked among the faithful, that is,</p>
<p>professes himself a member of the Church of England.  This reason</p>
<p>(which carries mathematical evidence with it) has converted such</p>
<p>numbers of Dissenters of all persuasions, that not a twentieth part</p>
<p>of the nation is out of the pale of the Established Church.  The</p>
<p>English clergy have retained a great number of the Romish</p>
<p>ceremonies, and especially that of receiving, with a most scrupulous</p>
<p>attention, their tithes.  They also have the pious ambition to aim</p>
<p>at superiority.</p>
<p>Moreover, they inspire very religiously their flock with a holy zeal</p>
<p>against Dissenters of all denominations.  This zeal was pretty</p>
<p>violent under the Tories in the four last years of Queen Anne; but</p>
<p>was productive of no greater mischief than the breaking the windows</p>
<p>of some meeting-houses and the demolishing of a few of them.  For</p>
<p>religious rage ceased in England with the civil wars, and was no</p>
<p>more under Queen Anne than the hollow noise of a sea whose billows</p>
<p>still heaved, though so long after the storm when the Whigs and</p>
<p>Tories laid waste their native country, in the same manner as the</p>
<p>Guelphs and Ghibelins formerly did theirs.  It was absolutely</p>
<p>necessary for both parties to call in religion on this occasion; the</p>
<p>Tories declared for Episcopacy, and the Whigs, as some imagined,</p>
<p>were for abolishing it; however, after these had got the upper hand,</p>
<p>they contented themselves with only abridging it.</p>
<p>At the time when the Earl of Oxford and the Lord Bolingbroke used to</p>
<p>drink healths to the Tories, the Church of England considered those</p>
<p>noblemen as the defenders of its holy privileges.  The lower House</p>
<p>of Convocation (a kind of House of Commons) composed wholly of the</p>
<p>clergy, was in some credit at that time; at least the members of it</p>
<p>had the liberty to meet, to dispute on ecclesiastical matters, to</p>
<p>sentence impious books from time to time to the flames, that is,</p>
<p>books written against themselves.  The Ministry which is now</p>
<p>composed of Whigs does not so much as allow those gentlemen to</p>
<p>assemble, so that they are at this time reduced (in the obscurity of</p>
<p>their respective parishes) to the melancholy occupation of praying</p>
<p>for the prosperity of the Government whose tranquillity they would</p>
<p>willingly disturb.  With regard to the bishops, who are twenty-six</p>
<p>in all, they still have seats in the House of Lords in spite of the</p>
<p>Whigs, because the ancient abuse of considering them as barons</p>
<p>subsists to this day.  There is a clause, however, in the oath which</p>
<p>the Government requires from these gentlemen, that puts their</p>
<p>Christian patience to a very great trial, viz., that they shall be</p>
<p>of the Church of England as by law established.  There are few</p>
<p>bishops, deans, or other dignitaries, but imagine they are so jure</p>
<p>divino; it is consequently a great mortification to them to be</p>
<p>obliged to confess that they owe their dignity to a pitiful law</p>
<p>enacted by a set of profane laymen.  A learned monk (Father</p>
<p>Courayer) wrote a book lately to prove the validity and succession</p>
<p>of English ordinations.  This book was forbid in France, but do you</p>
<p>believe that the English Ministry were pleased with it?  Far from</p>
<p>it.  Those wicked Whigs don&#x27;t care a straw whether the episcopal</p>
<p>succession among them hath been interrupted or not, or whether</p>
<p>Bishop Parker was consecrated (as it is pretended) in a tavern or a</p>
<p>church; for these Whigs are much better pleased that the Bishops</p>
<p>should derive their authority from the Parliament than from the</p>
<p>Apostles.  The Lord Bolingbroke observed that this notion of divine</p>
<p>right would only make so many tyrants in lawn sleeves, but that the</p>
<p>laws made so many citizens.</p>
<p>With regard to the morals of the English clergy, they are more</p>
<p>regular than those of France, and for this reason.  All the clergy</p>
<p>(a very few excepted) are educated in the Universities of Oxford or</p>
<p>Cambridge, far from the depravity and corruption which reign in the</p>
<p>capital.  They are not called to dignities till very late, at a time</p>
<p>of life when men are sensible of no other passion but avarice, that</p>
<p>is, when their ambition craves a supply.  Employments are here</p>
<p>bestowed both in the Church and the army, as a reward for long</p>
<p>services; and we never see youngsters made bishops or colonels</p>
<p>immediately upon their laying aside the academical gown; and besides</p>
<p>most of the clergy are married.  The stiff and awkward air</p>
<p>contracted by them at the University, and the little familiarity the</p>
<p>men of this country have with the ladies, commonly oblige a bishop</p>
<p>to confine himself to, and rest contented with, his own.  Clergymen</p>
<p>sometimes take a glass at the tavern, custom giving them a sanction</p>
<p>on this occasion; and if they fuddle themselves it is in a very</p>
<p>serious manner, and without giving the least scandal.</p>
<p>That fable-mixed kind of mortal (not to be defined), who is neither</p>
<p>of the clergy nor of the laity; in a word, the thing called Abbe in</p>
<p>France; is a species quite unknown in England.  All the clergy here</p>
<p>are very much upon the reserve, and most of them pedants.  When</p>
<p>these are told that in France young fellows famous for their</p>
<p>dissoluteness, and raised to the highest dignities of the Church by</p>
<p>female intrigues, address the fair publicly in an amorous way, amuse</p>
<p>themselves in writing tender love songs, entertain their friends</p>
<p>very splendidly every night at their own houses, and after the</p>
<p>banquet is ended withdraw to invoke the assistance of the Holy</p>
<p>Ghost, and call themselves boldly the successors of the Apostles,</p>
<p>they bless God for their being Protestants.  But these are shameless</p>
<p>heretics, who deserve to be blown hence through the flames to old</p>
<p>Nick, as Rabelais says, and for this reason I do not trouble myself</p>
<p>about them.</p>
<p>LETTER VI.--ON THE PRESBYTERIANS</p>
<p>The Church of England is confined almost to the kingdom whence it</p>
<p>received its name, and to Ireland, for Presbyterianism is the</p>
<p>established religion in Scotland.  This Presbyterianism is directly</p>
<p>the same with Calvinism, as it was established in France, and is now</p>
<p>professed at Geneva.  As the priests of this sect receive but very</p>
<p>inconsiderable stipends from their churches, and consequently cannot</p>
<p>emulate the splendid luxury of bishops, they exclaim very naturally</p>
<p>against honours which they can never attain to.  Figure to yourself</p>
<p>the haughty Diogenes trampling under foot the pride of Plato.  The</p>
<p>Scotch Presbyterians are not very unlike that proud though tattered</p>
<p>reasoner.  Diogenes did not use Alexander half so impertinently as</p>
<p>these treated King Charles II.; for when they took up arms in his</p>
<p>cause in opposition to Oliver, who had deceived them, they forced</p>
<p>that poor monarch to undergo the hearing of three or four sermons</p>
<p>every day, would not suffer him to play, reduced him to a state of</p>
<p>penitence and mortification, so that Charles soon grew sick of these</p>
<p>pedants, and accordingly eloped from them with as much joy as a</p>
<p>youth does from school.</p>
<p>A Church of England minister appears as another Cato in presence of</p>
<p>a juvenile, sprightly French graduate, who bawls for a whole morning</p>
<p>together in the divinity schools, and hums a song in chorus with</p>
<p>ladies in the evening; but this Cato is a very spark when before a</p>
<p>Scotch Presbyterian.  The latter affects a serious gait, puts on a</p>
<p>sour look, wears a vastly broad-brimmed hat and a long cloak over a</p>
<p>very short coat, preaches through the nose, and gives the name of</p>
<p>the whore of Babylon to all churches where the ministers are so</p>
<p>fortunate as to enjoy an annual revenue of five or six thousand</p>
<p>pounds, and where the people are weak enough to suffer this, and to</p>
<p>give them the titles of my lord, your lordship, or your eminence.</p>
<p>These gentlemen, who have also some churches in England, introduced</p>
<p>there the mode of grave and severe exhortations.  To them is owing</p>
<p>the sanctification of Sunday in the three kingdoms.  People are</p>
<p>there forbidden to work or take any recreation on that day, in which</p>
<p>the severity is twice as great as that of the Romish Church.  No</p>
<p>operas, plays, or concerts are allowed in London on Sundays, and</p>
<p>even cards are so expressly forbidden that none but persons of</p>
<p>quality, and those we call the genteel, play on that day; the rest</p>
<p>of the nation go either to church, to the tavern, or to see their</p>
<p>mistresses.</p>
<p>Though the Episcopal and Presbyterian sects are the two prevailing</p>
<p>ones in Great Britain, yet all others are very welcome to come and</p>
<p>settle in it, and live very sociably together, though most of their</p>
<p>preachers hate one another almost as cordially as a Jansenist damns</p>
<p>a Jesuit.</p>
<p>Take a view of the Royal Exchange in London, a place more venerable</p>
<p>than many courts of justice, where the representatives of all</p>
<p>nations meet for the benefit of mankind.  There the Jew, the</p>
<p>Mahometan, and the Christian transact together, as though they all</p>
<p>professed the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none</p>
<p>but bankrupts.  There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist,</p>
<p>and the Churchman depends on the Quaker&#x27;s word.</p>
<p>If one religion only were allowed in England, the Government would</p>
<p>very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people</p>
<p>would cut one another&#x27;s throats; but as there are such a multitude,</p>
<p>they all live happy and in peace.</p>
<p>LETTER VII.--ON THE SOCINIANS, OR ARIANS, OR ANTITRINITARIANS</p>
<p>There is a little sect here composed of clergymen, and of a few very</p>
<p>learned persons among the laity, who, though they do not call</p>
<p>themselves Arians or Socinians, do yet dissent entirely from St.</p>
<p>Athanasius with regard to their notions of the Trinity, and declare</p>
<p>very frankly that the Father is greater than the Son.</p>
<p>Do you remember what is related of a certain orthodox bishop, who,</p>
<p>in order to convince an emperor of the reality of consubstantiation,</p>
<p>put his hand under the chin of the monarch&#x27;s son, and took him by</p>
<p>the nose in presence of his sacred majesty?  The emperor was going</p>
<p>to order his attendants to throw the bishop out of the window, when</p>
<p>the good old man gave him this handsome and convincing reason:</p>
<p>&quot;Since your majesty,&quot; says he, &quot;is angry when your son has not due</p>
<p>respect shown him, what punishment do you think will God the Father</p>
<p>inflict on those who refuse His Son Jesus the titles due to Him?&quot;</p>
<p>The persons I just now mentioned declare that the holy bishop took a</p>
<p>very wrong step, that his argument was inconclusive, and that the</p>
<p>emperor should have answered him thus:  &quot;Know that there are two</p>
<p>ways by which men may be wanting in respect to me--first, in not</p>
<p>doing honour sufficient to my son; and, secondly, in paying him the</p>
<p>same honour as to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Be this as it will, the principles of Arius begin to revive, not</p>
<p>only in England, but in Holland and Poland.  The celebrated Sir</p>
<p>Isaac Newton honoured this opinion so far as to countenance it.</p>
<p>This philosopher thought that the Unitarians argued more</p>
<p>mathematically than we do.  But the most sanguine stickler for</p>
<p>Arianism is the illustrious Dr. Clark.  This man is rigidly</p>
<p>virtuous, and of a mild disposition, is more fond of his tenets than</p>
<p>desirous of propagating them, and absorbed so entirely in problems</p>
<p>and calculations that he is a mere reasoning machine.</p>
<p>It is he who wrote a book which is much esteemed and little</p>
<p>understood, on the existence of God, and another, more intelligible,</p>
<p>but pretty much contemned, on the truth of the Christian religion.</p>
<p>He never engaged in scholastic disputes, which our friend calls</p>
<p>venerable trifles.  He only published a work containing all the</p>
<p>testimonies of the primitive ages for and against the Unitarians,</p>
<p>and leaves to the reader the counting of the voices and the liberty</p>
<p>of forming a judgment.  This book won the doctor a great number of</p>
<p>partisans, and lost him the See of Canterbury; but, in my humble</p>
<p>opinion, he was out in his calculation, and had better have been</p>
<p>Primate of all England than merely an Arian parson.</p>
<p>You see that opinions are subject to revolutions as well as empires.</p>
<p>Arianism, after having triumphed during three centuries, and been</p>
<p>forgot twelve, rises at last out of its own ashes; but it has chosen</p>
<p>a very improper season to make its appearance in, the present age</p>
<p>being quite cloyed with disputes and sects.  The members of this</p>
<p>sect are, besides, too few to be indulged the liberty of holding</p>
<p>public assemblies, which, however, they will, doubtless, be</p>
<p>permitted to do in case they spread considerably.  But people are</p>
<p>now so very cold with respect to all things of this kind, that there</p>
<p>is little probability any new religion, or old one, that may be</p>
<p>revived, will meet with favour.  Is it not whimsical enough that</p>
<p>Luther, Calvin, and Zuinglius, all of them wretched authors, should</p>
<p>have founded sects which are now spread over a great part of Europe,</p>
<p>that Mahomet, though so ignorant, should have given a religion to</p>
<p>Asia and Africa, and that Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Clark, Mr. Locke,</p>
<p>Mr. Le Clerc, etc., the greatest philosophers, as well as the ablest</p>
<p>writers of their ages, should scarcely have been able to raise a</p>
<p>little flock, which even decreases daily.</p>
<p>This it is to be born at a proper period of time.  Were Cardinal de</p>
<p>Retz to return again into the world, neither his eloquence nor his</p>
<p>intrigues would draw together ten women in Paris.</p>
<p>Were Oliver Cromwell, he who beheaded his sovereign, and seized upon</p>
<p>the kingly dignity, to rise from the dead, he would be a wealthy</p>
<p>City trader, and no more.</p>
<p>LETTER VIII.--ON THE PARLIAMENT</p>
<p>The members of the English Parliament are fond of comparing</p>
<p>themselves to the old Romans.</p>
<p>Not long since Mr. Shippen opened a speech in the House of Commons</p>
<p>with these words, &quot;The majesty of the people of England would be</p>
<p>wounded.&quot;  The singularity of the expression occasioned a loud</p>
<p>laugh; but this gentleman, so far from being disconcerted, repeated</p>
<p>the same words with a resolute tone of voice, and the laugh ceased.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the majesty of the people of England has nothing in</p>
<p>common with that of the people of Rome, much less is there any</p>
<p>affinity between their Governments.  There is in London a senate,</p>
<p>some of the members whereof are accused (doubtless very unjustly) of</p>
<p>selling their voices on certain occasions, as was done in Rome; this</p>
<p>is the only resemblance.  Besides, the two nations appear to me</p>
<p>quite opposite in character, with regard both to good and evil.  The</p>
<p>Romans never knew the dreadful folly of religious wars, an</p>
<p>abomination reserved for devout preachers of patience and humility.</p>
<p>Marius and Sylla, Caesar and Pompey, Anthony and Augustus, did not</p>
<p>draw their swords and set the world in a blaze merely to determine</p>
<p>whether the flamen should wear his shirt over his robe, or his robe</p>
<p>over his shirt, or whether the sacred chickens should eat and drink,</p>
<p>or eat only, in order to take the augury.  The English have hanged</p>
<p>one another by law, and cut one another to pieces in pitched</p>
<p>battles, for quarrels of as trifling a nature.  The sects of the</p>
<p>Episcopalians and Presbyterians quite distracted these very serious</p>
<p>heads for a time.  But I fancy they will hardly ever be so silly</p>
<p>again, they seeming to be grown wiser at their own expense; and I do</p>
<p>not perceive the least inclination in them to murder one another</p>
<p>merely about syllogisms, as some zealots among them once did.</p>
<p>But here follows a more essential difference between Rome and</p>
<p>England, which gives the advantage entirely to the latter--viz.,</p>
<p>that the civil wars of Rome ended in slavery, and those of the</p>
<p>English in liberty.  The English are the only people upon earth who</p>
<p>have been able to prescribe limits to the power of kings by</p>
<p>resisting them; and who, by a series of struggles, have at last</p>
<p>established that wise Government where the Prince is all-powerful to</p>
<p>do good, and, at the same time, is restrained from committing evil;</p>
<p>where the nobles are great without insolence, though there are no</p>
<p>vassals; and where the people share in the Government without</p>
<p>confusion.</p>
<p>The House of Lords and that of the Commons divide the legislative</p>
<p>power under the king, but the Romans had no such balance.  The</p>
<p>patricians and plebeians in Rome were perpetually at variance, and</p>
<p>there was no intermediate power to reconcile them.  The Roman</p>
<p>senate, who were so unjustly, so criminally proud as not to suffer</p>
<p>the plebeians to share with them in anything, could find no other</p>
<p>artifice to keep the latter out of the administration than by</p>
<p>employing them in foreign wars.  They considered the plebeians as a</p>
<p>wild beast, whom it behoved them to let loose upon their neighbours,</p>
<p>for fear they should devour their masters.  Thus the greatest defect</p>
<p>in the Government of the Romans raised them to be conquerors.  By</p>
<p>being unhappy at home, they triumphed over and possessed themselves</p>
<p>of the world, till at last their divisions sunk them to slavery.</p>
<p>The Government of England will never rise to so exalted a pitch of</p>
<p>glory, nor will its end be so fatal.  The English are not fired with</p>
<p>the splendid folly of making conquests, but would only prevent their</p>
<p>neighbours from conquering.  They are not only jealous of their own</p>
<p>liberty, but even of that of other nations.  The English were</p>
<p>exasperated against Louis XIV. for no other reason but because he</p>
<p>was ambitious, and declared war against him merely out of levity,</p>
<p>not from any interested motives.</p>
<p>The English have doubtless purchased their liberties at a very high</p>
<p>price, and waded through seas of blood to drown the idol of</p>
<p>arbitrary power.  Other nations have been involved in as great</p>
<p>calamities, and have shed as much blood; but then the blood they</p>
<p>spilt in defence of their liberties only enslaved them the more.</p>
<p>That which rises to a revolution in England is no more than a</p>
<p>sedition in other countries.  A city in Spain, in Barbary, or in</p>
<p>Turkey, takes up arms in defence of its privileges, when immediately</p>
<p>it is stormed by mercenary troops, it is punished by executioners,</p>
<p>and the rest of the nation kiss the chains they are loaded with.</p>
<p>The French are of opinion that the government of this island is more</p>
<p>tempestuous than the sea which surrounds it, which indeed is true;</p>
<p>but then it is never so but when the king raises the storm--when he</p>
<p>attempts to seize the ship of which he is only the chief pilot.  The</p>
<p>civil wars of France lasted longer, were more cruel, and productive</p>
<p>of greater evils than those of England; but none of these civil wars</p>
<p>had a wise and prudent liberty for their object.</p>
<p>In the detestable reigns of Charles IX. and Henry III. the whole</p>
<p>affair was only whether the people should be slaves to the Guises.</p>
<p>With regard to the last war of Paris, it deserves only to be hooted</p>
<p>at.  Methinks I see a crowd of schoolboys rising up in arms against</p>
<p>their master, and afterwards whipped for it.  Cardinal de Retz, who</p>
<p>was witty and brave (but to no purpose), rebellious without a cause,</p>
<p>factious without design, and head of a defenceless party, caballed</p>
<p>for caballing sake, and seemed to foment the civil war merely out of</p>
<p>diversion.  The Parliament did not know what he intended, nor what</p>
<p>he did not intend.  He levied troops by Act of Parliament, and the</p>
<p>next moment cashiered them.  He threatened, he begged pardon; he set</p>
<p>a price upon Cardinal Mazarin&#x27;s head, and afterwards congratulated</p>
<p>him in a public manner.  Our civil wars under Charles VI. were</p>
<p>bloody and cruel, those of the League execrable, and that of the</p>
<p>Frondeurs ridiculous.</p>
<p>That for which the French chiefly reproach the English nation is the</p>
<p>murder of King Charles I., whom his subjects treated exactly as he</p>
<p>would have treated them had his reign been prosperous.  After all,</p>
<p>consider on one side Charles I., defeated in a pitched battle,</p>
<p>imprisoned, tried, sentenced to die in Westminster Hall, and then</p>
<p>beheaded.  And on the other, the Emperor Henry VII., poisoned by his</p>
<p>chaplain at his receiving the Sacrament; Henry III. stabbed by a</p>
<p>monk; thirty assassinations projected against Henry IV., several of</p>
<p>them put in execution, and the last bereaving that great monarch of</p>
<p>his life.  Weigh, I say, all these wicked attempts, and then judge.</p>
<p>LETTER IX.--ON THE GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>That mixture in the English Government, that harmony between King,</p>
<p>Lords, and commons, did not always subsist.  England was enslaved</p>
<p>for a long series of years by the Romans, the Saxons, the Danes, and</p>
<p>the French successively.  William the Conqueror particularly, ruled</p>
<p>them with a rod of iron.  He disposed as absolutely of the lives and</p>
<p>fortunes of his conquered subjects as an eastern monarch; and</p>
<p>forbade, upon pain of death, the English either fire or candle in</p>
<p>their houses after eight o&#x27;clock; whether was this to prevent their</p>
<p>nocturnal meetings, or only to try, by an odd and whimsical</p>
<p>prohibition, how far it was possible for one man to extend his power</p>
<p>over his fellow-creatures.  It is true, indeed, that the English had</p>
<p>Parliaments before and after William the Conqueror, and they boast</p>
<p>of them, as though these assemblies then called Parliaments,</p>
<p>composed of ecclesiastical tyrants and of plunderers entitled</p>
<p>barons, had been the guardians of the public liberty and happiness.</p>
<p>The barbarians who came from the shores of the Baltic, and settled</p>
<p>in the rest of Europe, brought with them the form of government</p>
<p>called States or Parliaments, about which so much noise is made, and</p>
<p>which are so little understood.  Kings, indeed, were not absolute in</p>
<p>those days; but then the people were more wretched upon that very</p>
<p>account, and more completely enslaved.  The chiefs of these savages,</p>
<p>who had laid waste France, Italy, Spain, and England, made</p>
<p>themselves monarchs.  Their generals divided among themselves the</p>
<p>several countries they had conquered, whence sprung those margraves,</p>
<p>those peers, those barons, those petty tyrants, who often contested</p>
<p>with their sovereigns for the spoils of whole nations.  These were</p>
<p>birds of prey fighting with an eagle for doves whose blood the</p>
<p>victorious was to suck.  Every nation, instead of being governed by</p>
<p>one master, was trampled upon by a hundred tyrants.  The priests</p>
<p>soon played a part among them.  Before this it had been the fate of</p>
<p>the Gauls, the Germans, and the Britons, to be always governed by</p>
<p>their Druids and the chiefs of their villages, an ancient kind of</p>
<p>barons, not so tyrannical as their successors.  These Druids</p>
<p>pretended to be mediators between God and man.  They enacted laws,</p>
<p>they fulminated their excommunications, and sentenced to death.  The</p>
<p>bishops succeeded, by insensible degrees, to their temporal</p>
<p>authority in the Goth and Vandal government.  The popes set</p>
<p>themselves at their head, and armed with their briefs, their bulls,</p>
<p>and reinforced by monks, they made even kings tremble, deposed and</p>
<p>assassinated them at pleasure, and employed every artifice to draw</p>
<p>into their own purses moneys from all parts of Europe.  The weak</p>
<p>Ina, one of the tyrants of the Saxon Heptarchy in England, was the</p>
<p>first monarch who submitted, in his pilgrimage to Rome, to pay St.</p>
<p>Peter&#x27;s penny (equivalent very near to a French crown) for every</p>
<p>house in his dominions.  The whole island soon followed his example;</p>
<p>England became insensibly one of the Pope&#x27;s provinces, and the Holy</p>
<p>Father used to send from time to time his legates thither to levy</p>
<p>exorbitant taxes.  At last King John delivered up by a public</p>
<p>instrument the kingdom of England to the Pope, who had</p>
<p>excommunicated him; but the barons, not finding their account in</p>
<p>this resignation, dethroned the wretched King John and seated Louis,</p>
<p>father to St. Louis, King of France, in his place.  However, they</p>
<p>were soon weary of their new monarch, and accordingly obliged him to</p>
<p>return to France.</p>
<p>Whilst that the barons, the bishops, and the popes, all laid waste</p>
<p>England, where all were for ruling the most numerous, the most</p>
<p>useful, even the most virtuous, and consequently the most venerable</p>
<p>part of mankind, consisting of those who study the laws and the</p>
<p>sciences, of traders, of artificers, in a word, of all who were not</p>
<p>tyrants--that is, those who are called the people:  these, I say,</p>
<p>were by them looked upon as so many animals beneath the dignity of</p>
<p>the human species.  The Commons in those ages were far from sharing</p>
<p>in the government, they being villains or peasants, whose labour,</p>
<p>whose blood, were the property of their masters who entitled</p>
<p>themselves the nobility.  The major part of men in Europe were at</p>
<p>that time what they are to this day in several parts of the world--</p>
<p>they were villains or bondsmen of lords--that is, a kind of cattle</p>
<p>bought and sold with the land.  Many ages passed away before justice</p>
<p>could be done to human nature--before mankind were conscious that it</p>
<p>was abominable for many to sow, and but few reap.  And was not</p>
<p>France very happy, when the power and authority of those petty</p>
<p>robbers was abolished by the lawful authority of kings and of the</p>
<p>people?</p>
<p>Happily, in the violent shocks which the divisions between kings and</p>
<p>the nobles gave to empires, the chains of nations were more or less</p>
<p>heavy.  Liberty in England sprang from the quarrels of tyrants.  The</p>
<p>barons forced King John and King Henry III. to grant the famous</p>
<p>Magna Charta, the chief design of which was indeed to make kings</p>
<p>dependent on the Lords; but then the rest of the nation were a</p>
<p>little favoured in it, in order that they might join on proper</p>
<p>occasions with their pretended masters.  This great Charter, which</p>
<p>is considered as the sacred origin of the English liberties, shows</p>
<p>in itself how little liberty was known.</p>
<p>The title alone proves that the king thought he had a just right to</p>
<p>be absolute; and that the barons, and even the clergy, forced him to</p>
<p>give up the pretended right, for no other reason but because they</p>
<p>were the most powerful.</p>
<p>Magna Charta begins in this style:  &quot;We grant, of our own free will,</p>
<p>the following privileges to the archbishops, bishops, priors, and</p>
<p>barons of our kingdom,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>The House of Commons is not once mentioned in the articles of this</p>
<p>Charter--a proof that it did not yet exist, or that it existed</p>
<p>without power.  Mention is therein made, by name, of the freemen of</p>
<p>England--a melancholy proof that some were not so.  It appears, by</p>
<p>Article XXXII., that these pretended freemen owed service to their</p>
<p>lords.  Such a liberty as this was not many removes from slavery.</p>
<p>By Article XXI., the king ordains that his officers shall not</p>
<p>henceforward seize upon, unless they pay for them, the horses and</p>
<p>carts of freemen.  The people considered this ordinance as a real</p>
<p>liberty, though it was a greater tyranny.  Henry VII., that happy</p>
<p>usurper and great politician, who pretended to love the barons,</p>
<p>though he in reality hated and feared them, got their lands</p>
<p>alienated.  By this means the villains, afterwards acquiring riches</p>
<p>by their industry, purchased the estates and country seats of the</p>
<p>illustrious peers who had ruined themselves by their folly and</p>
<p>extravagance, and all the lands got by insensible degrees into other</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>The power of the House of Commons increased every day.  The families</p>
<p>of the ancient peers were at last extinct; and as peers only are</p>
<p>properly noble in England, there would be no such thing in</p>
<p>strictness of law as nobility in that island, had not the kings</p>
<p>created new barons from time to time, and preserved the body of</p>
<p>peers, once a terror to them, to oppose them to the Commons, since</p>
<p>become so formidable.</p>
<p>All these new peers who compose the Higher House receive nothing but</p>
<p>their titles from the king, and very few of them have estates in</p>
<p>those places whence they take their titles.  One shall be Duke of D-</p>
<p>, though he has not a foot of land in Dorsetshire; and another is</p>
<p>Earl of a village, though he scarce knows where it is situated.  The</p>
<p>peers have power, but it is only in the Parliament House.</p>
<p>There is no such thing here as haute, moyenne, and basse justice--</p>
<p>that is, a power to judge in all matters civil and criminal; nor a</p>
<p>right or privilege of hunting in the grounds of a citizen, who at</p>
<p>the same time is not permitted to fire a gun in his own field.</p>
<p>No one is exempted in this country from paying certain taxes because</p>
<p>he is a nobleman or a priest.  All duties and taxes are settled by</p>
<p>the House of Commons, whose power is greater than that of the Peers,</p>
<p>though inferior to it in dignity.  The spiritual as well as temporal</p>
<p>Lords have the liberty to reject a Money Bill brought in by the</p>
<p>Commons; but they are not allowed to alter anything in it, and must</p>
<p>either pass or throw it out without restriction.  When the Bill has</p>
<p>passed the Lords and is signed by the king, then the whole nation</p>
<p>pays, every man in proportion to his revenue or estate, not</p>
<p>according to his title, which would be absurd.  There is no such</p>
<p>thing as an arbitrary subsidy or poll-tax, but a real tax on the</p>
<p>lands, of all which an estimate was made in the reign of the famous</p>
<p>King William III.</p>
<p>The land-tax continues still upon the same foot, though the revenue</p>
<p>of the lands is increased.  Thus no one is tyrannised over, and</p>
<p>every one is easy.  The feet of the peasants are not bruised by</p>
<p>wooden shoes; they eat white bread, are well clothed, and are not</p>
<p>afraid of increasing their stock of cattle, nor of tiling their</p>
<p>houses, from any apprehension that their taxes will be raised the</p>
<p>year following.  The annual income of the estates of a great many</p>
<p>commoners in England amounts to two hundred thousand livres, and yet</p>
<p>these do not think it beneath them to plough the lands which enrich</p>
<p>them, and on which they enjoy their liberty.</p>
<p>LETTER X.--ON TRADE</p>
<p>As trade enriched the citizens in England, so it contributed to</p>
<p>their freedom, and this freedom on the other side extended their</p>
<p>commerce, whence arose the grandeur of the State.  Trade raised by</p>
<p>insensible degrees the naval power, which gives the English a</p>
<p>superiority over the seas, and they now are masters of very near two</p>
<p>hundred ships of war.  Posterity will very probably be surprised to</p>
<p>hear that an island whose only produce is a little lead, tin,</p>
<p>fuller&#x27;s-earth, and coarse wool, should become so powerful by its</p>
<p>commerce, as to be able to send, in 1723, three fleets at the same</p>
<p>time to three different and far distanced parts of the globe.  One</p>
<p>before Gibraltar, conquered and still possessed by the English; a</p>
<p>second to Portobello, to dispossess the King of Spain of the</p>
<p>treasures of the West Indies; and a third into the Baltic, to</p>
<p>prevent the Northern Powers from coming to an engagement.</p>
<p>At the time when Louis XIV. made all Italy tremble, and that his</p>
<p>armies, which had already possessed themselves of Savoy and</p>
<p>Piedmont, were upon the point of taking Turin; Prince Eugene was</p>
<p>obliged to march from the middle of Germany in order to succour</p>
<p>Savoy.  Having no money, without which cities cannot be either taken</p>
<p>or defended, he addressed himself to some English merchants.  These,</p>
<p>at an hour and half&#x27;s warning, lent him five millions, whereby he</p>
<p>was enabled to deliver Turin, and to beat the French; after which he</p>
<p>wrote the following short letter to the persons who had disbursed</p>
<p>him the above-mentioned sums:  &quot;Gentlemen, I have received your</p>
<p>money, and flatter myself that I have laid it out to your</p>
<p>satisfaction.&quot;  Such a circumstance as this raises a just pride in</p>
<p>an English merchant, and makes him presume (not without some reason)</p>
<p>to compare himself to a Roman citizen; and, indeed, a peer&#x27;s brother</p>
<p>does not think traffic beneath him.  When the Lord Townshend was</p>
<p>Minister of State, a brother of his was content to be a City</p>
<p>merchant; and at the time that the Earl of Oxford governed Great</p>
<p>Britain, a younger brother was no more than a factor in Aleppo,</p>
<p>where he chose to live, and where he died.  This custom, which</p>
<p>begins, however, to be laid aside, appears monstrous to Germans,</p>
<p>vainly puffed up with their extraction.  These think it morally</p>
<p>impossible that the son of an English peer should be no more than a</p>
<p>rich and powerful citizen, for all are princes in Germany.  There</p>
<p>have been thirty highnesses of the same name, all whose patrimony</p>
<p>consisted only in their escutcheons and their pride.</p>
<p>In France the title of marquis is given gratis to any one who will</p>
<p>accept of it; and whosoever arrives at Paris from the midst of the</p>
<p>most remote provinces with money in his purse, and a name</p>
<p>terminating in ac or ille, may strut about, and cry, &quot;Such a man as</p>
<p>I!  A man of my rank and figure!&quot; and may look down upon a trader</p>
<p>with sovereign contempt; whilst the trader on the other side, by</p>
<p>thus often hearing his profession treated so disdainfully, is fool</p>
<p>enough to blush at it.  However, I need not say which is most useful</p>
<p>to a nation; a lord, powdered in the tip of the mode, who knows</p>
<p>exactly at what o&#x27;clock the king rises and goes to bed, and who</p>
<p>gives himself airs of grandeur and state, at the same time that he</p>
<p>is acting the slave in the ante-chamber of a prime minister; or a</p>
<p>merchant, who enriches his country, despatches orders from his</p>
<p>counting-house to Surat and Grand Cairo, and contributes to the</p>
<p>well-being of the world.</p>
<p>LETTER XI.--ON INOCULATION</p>
<p>It is inadvertently affirmed in the Christian countries of Europe</p>
<p>that the English are fools and madmen.  Fools, because they give</p>
<p>their children the small-pox to prevent their catching it; and</p>
<p>madmen, because they wantonly communicate a certain and dreadful</p>
<p>distemper to their children, merely to prevent an uncertain evil.</p>
<p>The English, on the other side, call the rest of the Europeans</p>
<p>cowardly and unnatural.  Cowardly, because they are afraid of</p>
<p>putting their children to a little pain; unnatural, because they</p>
<p>expose them to die one time or other of the small-pox.  But that the</p>
<p>reader may be able to judge whether the English or those who differ</p>
<p>from them in opinion are in the right, here follows the history of</p>
<p>the famed inoculation, which is mentioned with so much dread in</p>
<p>France.</p>
<p>The Circassian women have, from time immemorial, communicated the</p>
<p>small-pox to their children when not above six months old by making</p>
<p>an incision in the arm, and by putting into this incision a pustule,</p>
<p>taken carefully from the body of another child.  This pustule</p>
<p>produces the same effect in the arm it is laid in as yeast in a</p>
<p>piece of dough; it ferments, and diffuses through the whole mass of</p>
<p>blood the qualities with which it is impregnated.  The pustules of</p>
<p>the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated</p>
<p>are employed to communicate the same distemper to others.  There is</p>
<p>an almost perpetual circulation of it in Circassia; and when</p>
<p>unhappily the small-pox has quite left the country, the inhabitants</p>
<p>of it are in as great trouble and perplexity as other nations when</p>
<p>their harvest has fallen short.</p>
<p>The circumstance that introduced a custom in Circassia, which</p>
<p>appears so singular to others, is nevertheless a cause common to all</p>
<p>nations, I mean maternal tenderness and interest.</p>
<p>The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and</p>
<p>indeed, it is in them they chiefly trade.  They furnish with</p>
<p>beauties the seraglios of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian Sophy,</p>
<p>and of all those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain</p>
<p>such precious merchandise.  These maidens are very honourably and</p>
<p>virtuously instructed to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of</p>
<p>a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most</p>
<p>voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for</p>
<p>whom they are designed.  These unhappy creatures repeat their lesson</p>
<p>to their mothers, in the same manner as little girls among us repeat</p>
<p>their catechism without understanding one word they say.</p>
<p>Now it often happened that, after a father and mother had taken the</p>
<p>utmost care of the education of their children, they were frustrated</p>
<p>of all their hopes in an instant.  The small-pox getting into the</p>
<p>family, one daughter died of it, another lost an eye, a third had a</p>
<p>great nose at her recovery, and the unhappy parents were completely</p>
<p>ruined.  Even, frequently, when the small-pox became epidemical,</p>
<p>trade was suspended for several years, which thinned very</p>
<p>considerably the seraglios of Persia and Turkey.</p>
<p>A trading nation is always watchful over its own interests, and</p>
<p>grasps at every discovery that may be of advantage to its commerce.</p>
<p>The Circassians observed that scarce one person in a thousand was</p>
<p>ever attacked by a small-pox of a violent kind.  That some, indeed,</p>
<p>had this distemper very favourably three or four times, but never</p>
<p>twice so as to prove fatal; in a word, that no one ever had it in a</p>
<p>violent degree twice in his life.  They observed farther, that when</p>
<p>the small-pox is of the milder sort, and the pustules have only a</p>
<p>tender, delicate skin to break through, they never leave the least</p>
<p>scar in the face.  From these natural observations they concluded,</p>
<p>that in case an infant of six months or a year old should have a</p>
<p>milder sort of small-pox, he would not die of it, would not be</p>
<p>marked, nor be ever afflicted with it again.</p>
<p>In order, therefore, to preserve the life and beauty of their</p>
<p>children, the only thing remaining was to give them the small-pox in</p>
<p>their infant years.  This they did by inoculating in the body of a</p>
<p>child a pustule taken from the most regular and at the same time the</p>
<p>most favourable sort of small-pox that could be procured.</p>
<p>The experiment could not possibly fail.  The Turks, who are people</p>
<p>of good sense, soon adopted this custom, insomuch that at this time</p>
<p>there is not a bassa in Constantinople but communicates the small-</p>
<p>pox to his children of both sexes immediately upon their being</p>
<p>weaned.</p>
<p>Some pretend that the Circassians borrowed this custom anciently</p>
<p>from the Arabians; but we shall leave the clearing up of this point</p>
<p>of history to some learned Benedictine, who will not fail to compile</p>
<p>a great many folios on this subject, with the several proofs or</p>
<p>authorities.  All I have to say upon it is that, in the beginning of</p>
<p>the reign of King George I., the Lady Wortley Montague, a woman of</p>
<p>as fine a genius, and endued with as great a strength of mind, as</p>
<p>any of her sex in the British Kingdoms, being with her husband, who</p>
<p>was ambassador at the Porte, made no scruple to communicate the</p>
<p>small-pox to an infant of which she was delivered in Constantinople.</p>
<p>The chaplain represented to his lady, but to no purpose, that this</p>
<p>was an unchristian operation, and therefore that it could succeed</p>
<p>with none but infidels.  However, it had the most happy effect upon</p>
<p>the son of the Lady Wortley Montague, who, at her return to England,</p>
<p>communicated the experiment to the Princess of Wales, now Queen of</p>
<p>England.  It must be confessed that this princess, abstracted from</p>
<p>her crown and titles, was born to encourage the whole circle of</p>
<p>arts, and to do good to mankind.  She appears as an amiable</p>
<p>philosopher on the throne, having never let slip one opportunity of</p>
<p>improving the great talents she received from Nature, nor of</p>
<p>exerting her beneficence.  It is she who, being informed that a</p>
<p>daughter of Milton was living, but in miserable circumstances,</p>
<p>immediately sent her a considerable present.  It is she who protects</p>
<p>the learned Father Courayer.  It is she who condescended to attempt</p>
<p>a reconciliation between Dr. Clark and Mr. Leibnitz.  The moment</p>
<p>this princess heard of inoculation, she caused an experiment of it</p>
<p>to be made on four criminals sentenced to die, and by that means</p>
<p>preserved their lives doubly; for she not only saved them from the</p>
<p>gallows, but by means of this artificial small-pox prevented their</p>
<p>ever having that distemper in a natural way, with which they would</p>
<p>very probably have been attacked one time or other, and might have</p>
<p>died of in a more advanced age.</p>
<p>The princess being assured of the usefulness of this operation,</p>
<p>caused her own children to be inoculated.  A great part of the</p>
<p>kingdom followed her example, and since that time ten thousand</p>
<p>children, at least, of persons of condition owe in this manner their</p>
<p>lives to her Majesty and to the Lady Wortley Montague; and as many</p>
<p>of the fair sex are obliged to them for their beauty.</p>
<p>Upon a general calculation, threescore persons in every hundred have</p>
<p>the small-pox.  Of these threescore, twenty die of it in the most</p>
<p>favourable season of life, and as many more wear the disagreeable</p>
<p>remains of it in their faces so long as they live.  Thus, a fifth</p>
<p>part of mankind either die or are disfigured by this distemper.  But</p>
<p>it does not prove fatal to so much as one among those who are</p>
<p>inoculated in Turkey or in England, unless the patient be infirm, or</p>
<p>would have died had not the experiment been made upon him.  Besides,</p>
<p>no one is disfigured, no one has the small-pox a second time, if the</p>
<p>inoculation was perfect.  It is therefore certain, that had the lady</p>
<p>of some French ambassador brought this secret from Constantinople to</p>
<p>Paris, the nation would have been for ever obliged to her.  Then the</p>
<p>Duke de Villequier, father to the Duke d&#x27;Aumont, who enjoys the most</p>
<p>vigorous constitution, and is the healthiest man in France, would</p>
<p>not have been cut off in the flower of his age.</p>
<p>The Prince of Soubise, happy in the finest flush of health, would</p>
<p>not have been snatched away at five-and-twenty, nor the Dauphin,</p>
<p>grandfather to Louis XV., have been laid in his grave in his</p>
<p>fiftieth year.  Twenty thousand persons whom the small-pox swept</p>
<p>away at Paris in 1723 would have been alive at this time.  But are</p>
<p>not the French fond of life, and is beauty so inconsiderable an</p>
<p>advantage as to be disregarded by the ladies?  It must be confessed</p>
<p>that we are an odd kind of people.  Perhaps our nation will imitate</p>
<p>ten years hence this practice of the English, if the clergy and the</p>
<p>physicians will but give them leave to do it; or possibly our</p>
<p>countrymen may introduce inoculation three months hence in France</p>
<p>out of mere whim, in case the English should discontinue it through</p>
<p>fickleness.</p>
<p>I am informed that the Chinese have practised inoculation these</p>
<p>hundred years, a circumstance that argues very much in its favour,</p>
<p>since they are thought to be the wisest and best governed people in</p>
<p>the world.  The Chinese, indeed, do not communicate this distemper</p>
<p>by inoculation, but at the nose, in the same manner as we take</p>
<p>snuff.  This is a more agreeable way, but then it produces the like</p>
<p>effects; and proves at the same time that had inoculation been</p>
<p>practised in France it would have saved the lives of thousands.</p>
<p>LETTER XII.--ON THE LORD BACON</p>
<p>Not long since the trite and frivolous question following was</p>
<p>debated in a very polite and learned company, viz., Who was the</p>
<p>greatest man, Caesar, Alexander, Tamerlane, Cromwell, &amp;c.?</p>
<p>Somebody answered that Sir Isaac Newton excelled them all.  The</p>
<p>gentleman&#x27;s assertion was very just; for if true greatness consists</p>
<p>in having received from heaven a mighty genius, and in having</p>
<p>employed it to enlighten our own mind and that of others, a man like</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton, whose equal is hardly found in a thousand years,</p>
<p>is the truly great man.  And those politicians and conquerors (and</p>
<p>all ages produce some) were generally so many illustrious wicked</p>
<p>men.  That man claims our respect who commands over the minds of the</p>
<p>rest of the world by the force of truth, not those who enslave their</p>
<p>fellow-creatures:  he who is acquainted with the universe, not they</p>
<p>who deface it.</p>
<p>Since, therefore, you desire me to give you an account of the famous</p>
<p>personages whom England has given birth to, I shall begin with Lord</p>
<p>Bacon, Mr. Locke, Sir Isaac Newton, &amp;c.  Afterwards the warriors and</p>
<p>Ministers of State shall come in their order.</p>
<p>I must begin with the celebrated Viscount Verulam, known in Europe</p>
<p>by the name of Bacon, which was that of his family.  His father had</p>
<p>been Lord Keeper, and himself was a great many years Lord Chancellor</p>
<p>under King James I.  Nevertheless, amidst the intrigues of a Court,</p>
<p>and the affairs of his exalted employment, which alone were enough</p>
<p>to engross his whole time, he yet found so much leisure for study as</p>
<p>to make himself a great philosopher, a good historian, and an</p>
<p>elegant writer; and a still more surprising circumstance is that he</p>
<p>lived in an age in which the art of writing justly and elegantly was</p>
<p>little known, much less true philosophy.  Lord Bacon, as is the fate</p>
<p>of man, was more esteemed after his death than in his lifetime.  His</p>
<p>enemies were in the British Court, and his admirers were foreigners.</p>
<p>When the Marquis d&#x27;Effiat attended in England upon the Princess</p>
<p>Henrietta Maria, daughter to Henry IV., whom King Charles I. had</p>
<p>married, that Minister went and visited the Lord Bacon, who, being</p>
<p>at that time sick in his bed, received him with the curtains shut</p>
<p>close.  &quot;You resemble the angels,&quot; says the Marquis to him; &quot;we hear</p>
<p>those beings spoken of perpetually, and we believe them superior to</p>
<p>men, but are never allowed the consolation to see them.&quot;</p>
<p>You know that this great man was accused of a crime very unbecoming</p>
<p>a philosopher:  I mean bribery and extortion.  You know that he was</p>
<p>sentenced by the House of Lords to pay a fine of about four hundred</p>
<p>thousand French livres, to lose his peerage and his dignity of</p>
<p>Chancellor; but in the present age the English revere his memory to</p>
<p>such a degree, that they will scarce allow him to have been guilty.</p>
<p>In case you should ask what are my thoughts on this head, I shall</p>
<p>answer you in the words which I heard the Lord Bolingbroke use on</p>
<p>another occasion.  Several gentlemen were speaking, in his company,</p>
<p>of the avarice with which the late Duke of Marlborough had been</p>
<p>charged, some examples whereof being given, the Lord Bolingbroke was</p>
<p>appealed to (who, having been in the opposite party, might perhaps,</p>
<p>without the imputation of indecency, have been allowed to clear up</p>
<p>that matter):  &quot;He was so great a man,&quot; replied his lordship, &quot;that</p>
<p>I have forgot his vices.&quot;</p>
<p>I shall therefore confine myself to those things which so justly</p>
<p>gained Lord Bacon the esteem of all Europe.</p>
<p>The most singular and the best of all his pieces is that which, at</p>
<p>this time, is the most useless and the least read, I mean his Novum</p>
<p>Scientiarum Organum.  This is the scaffold with which the new</p>
<p>philosophy was raised; and when the edifice was built, part of it at</p>
<p>least, the scaffold was no longer of service.</p>
<p>The Lord Bacon was not yet acquainted with Nature, but then he knew,</p>
<p>and pointed out, the several paths that lead to it.  He had despised</p>
<p>in his younger years the thing called philosophy in the</p>
<p>Universities, and did all that lay in his power to prevent those</p>
<p>societies of men instituted to improve human reason from depraving</p>
<p>it by their quiddities, their horrors of the vacuum, their</p>
<p>substantial forms, and all those impertinent terms which not only</p>
<p>ignorance had rendered venerable, but which had been made sacred by</p>
<p>their being ridiculously blended with religion.</p>
<p>He is the father of experimental philosophy.  It must, indeed, be</p>
<p>confessed that very surprising secrets had been found out before his</p>
<p>time--the sea-compass, printing, engraving on copper plates, oil-</p>
<p>painting, looking-glasses; the art of restoring, in some measure,</p>
<p>old men to their sight by spectacles; gunpowder, &amp;c., had been</p>
<p>discovered.  A new world had been fought for, found, and conquered.</p>
<p>Would not one suppose that these sublime discoveries had been made</p>
<p>by the greatest philosophers, and in ages much more enlightened than</p>
<p>the present?  But it was far otherwise; all these great changes</p>
<p>happened in the most stupid and barbarous times.  Chance only gave</p>
<p>birth to most of those inventions; and it is very probable that what</p>
<p>is called chance contributed very much to the discovery of America;</p>
<p>at least, it has been always thought that Christopher Columbus</p>
<p>undertook his voyage merely on the relation of a captain of a ship</p>
<p>which a storm had driven as far westward as the Caribbean Islands.</p>
<p>Be this as it will, men had sailed round the world, and could</p>
<p>destroy cities by an artificial thunder more dreadful than the real</p>
<p>one; but, then, they were not acquainted with the circulation of the</p>
<p>blood, the weight of the air, the laws of motion, light, the number</p>
<p>of our planets, &amp;c.  And a man who maintained a thesis on</p>
<p>Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Categories,&quot; on the universals a parte rei, or such-</p>
<p>like nonsense, was looked upon as a prodigy.</p>
<p>The most astonishing, the most useful inventions, are not those</p>
<p>which reflect the greatest honour on the human mind.  It is to a</p>
<p>mechanical instinct, which is found in many men, and not to true</p>
<p>philosophy, that most arts owe their origin.</p>
<p>The discovery of fire, the art of making bread, of melting and</p>
<p>preparing metals, of building houses, and the invention of the</p>
<p>shuttle, are infinitely more beneficial to mankind than printing or</p>
<p>the sea-compass:  and yet these arts were invented by uncultivated,</p>
<p>savage men.</p>
<p>What a prodigious use the Greeks and Romans made afterwards of</p>
<p>mechanics!  Nevertheless, they believed that there were crystal</p>
<p>heavens, that the stars were small lamps which sometimes fell into</p>
<p>the sea, and one of their greatest philosophers, after long</p>
<p>researches, found that the stars were so many flints which had been</p>
<p>detached from the earth.</p>
<p>In a word, no one before the Lord Bacon was acquainted with</p>
<p>experimental philosophy, nor with the several physical experiments</p>
<p>which have been made since his time.  Scarce one of them but is</p>
<p>hinted at in his work, and he himself had made several.  He made a</p>
<p>kind of pneumatic engine, by which he guessed the elasticity of the</p>
<p>air.  He approached, on all sides as it were, to the discovery of</p>
<p>its weight, and had very near attained it, but some time after</p>
<p>Torricelli seized upon this truth.  In a little time experimental</p>
<p>philosophy began to be cultivated on a sudden in most parts of</p>
<p>Europe.  It was a hidden treasure which the Lord Bacon had some</p>
<p>notion of, and which all the philosophers, encouraged by his</p>
<p>promises, endeavoured to dig up.</p>
<p>But that which surprised me most was to read in his work, in express</p>
<p>terms, the new attraction, the invention of which is ascribed to Sir</p>
<p>Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>We must search, says Lord Bacon, whether there may not be a kind of</p>
<p>magnetic power which operates between the earth and heavy bodies,</p>
<p>between the moon and the ocean, between the planets, &amp;c.  In another</p>
<p>place he says either heavy bodies must be carried towards the centre</p>
<p>of the earth, or must be reciprocally attracted by it; and in the</p>
<p>latter case it is evident that the nearer bodies, in their falling,</p>
<p>draw towards the earth, the stronger they will attract one another.</p>
<p>We must, says he, make an experiment to see whether the same clock</p>
<p>will go faster on the top of a mountain or at the bottom of a mine;</p>
<p>whether the strength of the weights decreases on the mountain and</p>
<p>increases in the mine.  It is probable that the earth has a true</p>
<p>attractive power.</p>
<p>This forerunner in philosophy was also an elegant writer, an</p>
<p>historian, and a wit.</p>
<p>His moral essays are greatly esteemed, but they were drawn up in the</p>
<p>view of instructing rather than of pleasing; and, as they are not a</p>
<p>satire upon mankind, like Rochefoucauld&#x27;s &quot;Maxims,&quot; nor written upon</p>
<p>a sceptical plan, like Montaigne&#x27;s &quot;Essays,&quot; they are not so much</p>
<p>read as those two ingenious authors.</p>
<p>His History of Henry VII. was looked upon as a masterpiece, but how</p>
<p>is it possible that some persons can presume to compare so little a</p>
<p>work with the history of our illustrious Thuanus?</p>
<p>Speaking about the famous impostor Perkin, son to a converted Jew,</p>
<p>who assumed boldly the name and title of Richard IV., King of</p>
<p>England, at the instigation of the Duchess of Burgundy, and who</p>
<p>disputed the crown with Henry VII., the Lord Bacon writes as</p>
<p>follows:-</p>
<p>&quot;At this time the King began again to be haunted with sprites, by</p>
<p>the magic and curious arts of the Lady Margaret, who raised up the</p>
<p>ghost of Richard, Duke of York, second son to King Edward IV., to</p>
<p>walk and vex the King.</p>
<p>&quot;After such time as she (Margaret of Burgundy) thought he (Perkin</p>
<p>Warbeck) was perfect in his lesson, she began to cast with herself</p>
<p>from what coast this blazing star should first appear, and at what</p>
<p>time it must be upon the horizon of Ireland; for there had the like</p>
<p>meteor strong influence before.&quot;</p>
<p>Methinks our sagacious Thuanus does not give in to such fustian,</p>
<p>which formerly was looked upon as sublime, but in this age is justly</p>
<p>called nonsense.</p>
<p>LETTER XIII.--ON MR. LOCKE</p>
<p>Perhaps no man ever had a more judicious or more methodical genius,</p>
<p>or was a more acute logician than Mr. Locke, and yet he was not</p>
<p>deeply skilled in the mathematics.  This great man could never</p>
<p>subject himself to the tedious fatigue of calculations, nor to the</p>
<p>dry pursuit of mathematical truths, which do not at first present</p>
<p>any sensible objects to the mind; and no one has given better proofs</p>
<p>than he, that it is possible for a man to have a geometrical head</p>
<p>without the assistance of geometry.  Before his time, several great</p>
<p>philosophers had declared, in the most positive terms, what the soul</p>
<p>of man is; but as these absolutely knew nothing about it, they might</p>
<p>very well be allowed to differ entirely in opinion from one another.</p>
<p>In Greece, the infant seat of arts and of errors, and where the</p>
<p>grandeur as well as folly of the human mind went such prodigious</p>
<p>lengths, the people used to reason about the soul in the very same</p>
<p>manner as we do.</p>
<p>The divine Anaxagoras, in whose honour an altar was erected for his</p>
<p>having taught mankind that the sun was greater than Peloponnesus,</p>
<p>that snow was black, and that the heavens were of stone, affirmed</p>
<p>that the soul was an aerial spirit, but at the same time immortal.</p>
<p>Diogenes (not he who was a cynical philosopher after having coined</p>
<p>base money) declared that the soul was a portion of the substance of</p>
<p>God:  an idea which we must confess was very sublime.  Epicurus</p>
<p>maintained that it was composed of parts in the same manner as the</p>
<p>body.</p>
<p>Aristotle, who has been explained a thousand ways, because he is</p>
<p>unintelligible, was of opinion, according to some of his disciples,</p>
<p>that the understanding in all men is one and the same substance.</p>
<p>The divine Plato, master of the divine Aristotle,--and the divine</p>
<p>Socrates, master of the divine Plato--used to say that the soul was</p>
<p>corporeal and eternal.  No doubt but the demon of Socrates had</p>
<p>instructed him in the nature of it.  Some people, indeed, pretend</p>
<p>that a man who boasted his being attended by a familiar genius must</p>
<p>infallibly be either a knave or a madman, but this kind of people</p>
<p>are seldom satisfied with anything but reason.</p>
<p>With regard to the Fathers of the Church, several in the primitive</p>
<p>ages believed that the soul was human, and the angels and God</p>
<p>corporeal.  Men naturally improve upon every system.  St. Bernard,</p>
<p>as Father Mabillon confesses, taught that the soul after death does</p>
<p>not see God in the celestial regions, but converses with Christ&#x27;s</p>
<p>human nature only.  However, he was not believed this time on his</p>
<p>bare word; the adventure of the crusade having a little sunk the</p>
<p>credit of his oracles.  Afterwards a thousand schoolmen arose, such</p>
<p>as the Irrefragable Doctor, the Subtile Doctor, the Angelic Doctor,</p>
<p>the Seraphic Doctor, and the Cherubic Doctor, who were all sure that</p>
<p>they had a very clear and distinct idea of the soul, and yet wrote</p>
<p>in such a manner, that one would conclude they were resolved no one</p>
<p>should understand a word in their writings.  Our Descartes, born to</p>
<p>discover the errors of antiquity, and at the same time to substitute</p>
<p>his own, and hurried away by that systematic spirit which throws a</p>
<p>cloud over the minds of the greatest men, thought he had</p>
<p>demonstrated that the soul is the same thing as thought, in the same</p>
<p>manner as matter, in his opinion, is the same as extension.  He</p>
<p>asserted, that man thinks eternally, and that the soul, at its</p>
<p>coming into the body, is informed with the whole series of</p>
<p>metaphysical notions:  knowing God, infinite space, possessing all</p>
<p>abstract ideas--in a word, completely endued with the most sublime</p>
<p>lights, which it unhappily forgets at its issuing from the womb.</p>
<p>Father Malebranche, in his sublime illusions, not only admitted</p>
<p>innate ideas, but did not doubt of our living wholly in God, and</p>
<p>that God is, as it were, our soul.</p>
<p>Such a multitude of reasoners having written the romance of the</p>
<p>soul, a sage at last arose, who gave, with an air of the greatest</p>
<p>modesty, the history of it.  Mr. Locke has displayed the human soul</p>
<p>in the same manner as an excellent anatomist explains the springs of</p>
<p>the human body.  He everywhere takes the light of physics for his</p>
<p>guide.  He sometimes presumes to speak affirmatively, but then he</p>
<p>presumes also to doubt.  Instead of concluding at once what we know</p>
<p>not, he examines gradually what we would know.  He takes an infant</p>
<p>at the instant of his birth; he traces, step by step, the progress</p>
<p>of his understanding; examines what things he has in common with</p>
<p>beasts, and what he possesses above them.  Above all, he consults</p>
<p>himself:  the being conscious that he himself thinks.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall leave,&quot; says he, &quot;to those who know more of this matter</p>
<p>than myself, the examining whether the soul exists before or after</p>
<p>the organisation of our bodies.  But I confess that it is my lot to</p>
<p>be animated with one of those heavy souls which do not think always;</p>
<p>and I am even so unhappy as not to conceive that it is more</p>
<p>necessary the soul should think perpetually than that bodies should</p>
<p>be for ever in motion.&quot;</p>
<p>With regard to myself, I shall boast that I have the honour to be as</p>
<p>stupid in this particular as Mr. Locke.  No one shall ever make me</p>
<p>believe that I think always:  and I am as little inclined as he</p>
<p>could be to fancy that some weeks after I was conceived I was a very</p>
<p>learned soul; knowing at that time a thousand things which I forgot</p>
<p>at my birth; and possessing when in the womb (though to no manner of</p>
<p>purpose) knowledge which I lost the instant I had occasion for it;</p>
<p>and which I have never since been able to recover perfectly.</p>
<p>Mr. Locke, after having destroyed innate ideas; after having fully</p>
<p>renounced the vanity of believing that we think always; after having</p>
<p>laid down, from the most solid principles, that ideas enter the mind</p>
<p>through the senses; having examined our simple and complex ideas;</p>
<p>having traced the human mind through its several operations; having</p>
<p>shown that all the languages in the world are imperfect, and the</p>
<p>great abuse that is made of words every moment, he at last comes to</p>
<p>consider the extent or rather the narrow limits of human knowledge.</p>
<p>It was in this chapter he presumed to advance, but very modestly,</p>
<p>the following words:  &quot;We shall, perhaps, never be capable of</p>
<p>knowing whether a being, purely material, thinks or not.&quot;  This sage</p>
<p>assertion was, by more divines than one, looked upon as a scandalous</p>
<p>declaration that the soul is material and mortal.  Some Englishmen,</p>
<p>devout after their way, sounded an alarm.  The superstitious are the</p>
<p>same in society as cowards in an army; they themselves are seized</p>
<p>with a panic fear, and communicate it to others.  It was loudly</p>
<p>exclaimed that Mr. Locke intended to destroy religion; nevertheless,</p>
<p>religion had nothing to do in the affair, it being a question purely</p>
<p>philosophical, altogether independent of faith and revelation.  Mr.</p>
<p>Locke&#x27;s opponents needed but to examine, calmly and impartially,</p>
<p>whether the declaring that matter can think, implies a</p>
<p>contradiction; and whether God is able to communicate thought to</p>
<p>matter.  But divines are too apt to begin their declarations with</p>
<p>saying that God is offended when people differ from them in opinion;</p>
<p>in which they too much resemble the bad poets, who used to declare</p>
<p>publicly that Boileau spake irreverently of Louis XIV., because he</p>
<p>ridiculed their stupid productions.  Bishop Stillingfleet got the</p>
<p>reputation of a calm and unprejudiced divine because he did not</p>
<p>expressly make use of injurious terms in his dispute with Mr. Locke.</p>
<p>That divine entered the lists against him, but was defeated; for he</p>
<p>argued as a schoolman, and Locke as a philosopher, who was perfectly</p>
<p>acquainted with the strong as well as the weak side of the human</p>
<p>mind, and who fought with weapons whose temper he knew.  If I might</p>
<p>presume to give my opinion on so delicate a subject after Mr. Locke,</p>
<p>I would say, that men have long disputed on the nature and the</p>
<p>immortality of the soul.  With regard to its immortality, it is</p>
<p>impossible to give a demonstration of it, since its nature is still</p>
<p>the subject of controversy; which, however, must be thoroughly</p>
<p>understood before a person can be able to determine whether it be</p>
<p>immortal or not.  Human reason is so little able, merely by its own</p>
<p>strength, to demonstrate the immortality of the soul, that it was</p>
<p>absolutely necessary religion should reveal it to us.  It is of</p>
<p>advantage to society in general, that mankind should believe the</p>
<p>soul to be immortal; faith commands us to do this; nothing more is</p>
<p>required, and the matter is cleared up at once.  But it is otherwise</p>
<p>with respect to its nature; it is of little importance to religion,</p>
<p>which only requires the soul to be virtuous, whatever substance it</p>
<p>may be made of.  It is a clock which is given us to regulate, but</p>
<p>the artist has not told us of what materials the spring of this</p>
<p>chock is composed.</p>
<p>I am a body, and, I think, that&#x27;s all I know of the matter.  Shall I</p>
<p>ascribe to an unknown cause, what I can so easily impute to the only</p>
<p>second cause I am acquainted with?  Here all the school philosophers</p>
<p>interrupt me with their arguments, and declare that there is only</p>
<p>extension and solidity in bodies, and that there they can have</p>
<p>nothing but motion and figure.  Now motion, figure, extension and</p>
<p>solidity cannot form a thought, and consequently the soul cannot be</p>
<p>matter.  All this so often repeated mighty series of reasoning,</p>
<p>amounts to no more than this:  I am absolutely ignorant what matter</p>
<p>is; I guess, but imperfectly, some properties of it; now I</p>
<p>absolutely cannot tell whether these properties may be joined to</p>
<p>thought.  As I therefore know nothing, I maintain positively that</p>
<p>matter cannot think.  In this manner do the schools reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Locke addressed these gentlemen in the candid, sincere manner</p>
<p>following:  At least confess yourselves to be as ignorant as I.</p>
<p>Neither your imaginations nor mine are able to comprehend in what</p>
<p>manner a body is susceptible of ideas; and do you conceive better in</p>
<p>what manner a substance, of what kind soever, is susceptible of</p>
<p>them?  As you cannot comprehend either matter or spirit, why will</p>
<p>you presume to assert anything?</p>
<p>The superstitious man comes afterwards and declares, that all those</p>
<p>must be burnt for the good of their souls, who so much as suspect</p>
<p>that it is possible for the body to think without any foreign</p>
<p>assistance.  But what would these people say should they themselves</p>
<p>be proved irreligious?  And indeed, what man can presume to assert,</p>
<p>without being guilty at the same time of the greatest impiety, that</p>
<p>it is impossible for the Creator to form matter with thought and</p>
<p>sensation?  Consider only, I beg you, what a dilemma you bring</p>
<p>yourselves into, you who confine in this manner the power of the</p>
<p>Creator.  Beasts have the same organs, the same sensations, the same</p>
<p>perceptions as we; they have memory, and combine certain ideas.  In</p>
<p>case it was not in the power of God to animate matter, and inform it</p>
<p>with sensation, the consequence would be, either that beasts are</p>
<p>mere machines, or that they have a spiritual soul.</p>
<p>Methinks it is clearly evident that beasts cannot be mere machines,</p>
<p>which I prove thus.  God has given to them the very same organs of</p>
<p>sensation as to us:  if therefore they have no sensation, God has</p>
<p>created a useless thing; now according to your own confession God</p>
<p>does nothing in vain; He therefore did not create so many organs of</p>
<p>sensation, merely for them to be uninformed with this faculty;</p>
<p>consequently beasts are not mere machines.  Beasts, according to</p>
<p>your assertion, cannot be animated with a spiritual soul; you will,</p>
<p>therefore, in spite of yourself, be reduced to this only assertion,</p>
<p>viz., that God has endued the organs of beasts, who are mere matter,</p>
<p>with the faculties of sensation and perception, which you call</p>
<p>instinct in them.  But why may not God, if He pleases, communicate</p>
<p>to our more delicate organs, that faculty of feeling, perceiving,</p>
<p>and thinking, which we call human reason?  To whatever side you</p>
<p>turn, you are forced to acknowledge your own ignorance, and the</p>
<p>boundless power of the Creator.  Exclaim therefore no more against</p>
<p>the sage, the modest philosophy of Mr. Locke, which so far from</p>
<p>interfering with religion, would be of use to demonstrate the truth</p>
<p>of it, in case religion wanted any such support.  For what</p>
<p>philosophy can be of a more religious nature than that, which</p>
<p>affirming nothing but what it conceives clearly, and conscious of</p>
<p>its own weakness, declares that we must always have recourse to God</p>
<p>in our examining of the first principles?</p>
<p>Besides, we must not be apprehensive that any philosophical opinion</p>
<p>will ever prejudice the religion of a country.  Though our</p>
<p>demonstrations clash directly with our mysteries, that is nothing to</p>
<p>the purpose, for the latter are not less revered upon that account</p>
<p>by our Christian philosophers, who know very well that the objects</p>
<p>of reason and those of faith are of a very different nature.</p>
<p>Philosophers will never form a religious sect, the reason of which</p>
<p>is, their writings are not calculated for the vulgar, and they</p>
<p>themselves are free from enthusiasm.  If we divide mankind into</p>
<p>twenty parts, it will be found that nineteen of these consist of</p>
<p>persons employed in manual labour, who will never know that such a</p>
<p>man as Mr. Locke existed.  In the remaining twentieth part how few</p>
<p>are readers?  And among such as are so, twenty amuse themselves with</p>
<p>romances to one who studies philosophy.  The thinking part of</p>
<p>mankind is confined to a very small number, and these will never</p>
<p>disturb the peace and tranquillity of the world.</p>
<p>Neither Montaigne, Locke, Bayle, Spinoza, Hobbes, the Lord</p>
<p>Shaftesbury, Collins, nor Toland lighted up the firebrand of discord</p>
<p>in their countries; this has generally been the work of divines, who</p>
<p>being at first puffed up with the ambition of becoming chiefs of a</p>
<p>sect, soon grew very desirous of being at the head of a party.  But</p>
<p>what do I say?  All the works of the modern philosophers put</p>
<p>together will never make so much noise as even the dispute which</p>
<p>arose among the Franciscans, merely about the fashion of their</p>
<p>sleeves and of their cowls.</p>
<p>LETTER XIV.--ON DESCARTES AND SIR ISAAC NEWTON</p>
<p>A Frenchman who arrives in London, will find philosophy, like</p>
<p>everything else, very much changed there.  He had left the world a</p>
<p>plenum, and he now finds it a vacuum.  At Paris the universe is seen</p>
<p>composed of vortices of subtile matter; but nothing like it is seen</p>
<p>in London.  In France, it is the pressure of the moon that causes</p>
<p>the tides; but in England it is the sea that gravitates towards the</p>
<p>moon; so that when you think that the moon should make it flood with</p>
<p>us, those gentlemen fancy it should be ebb, which very unluckily</p>
<p>cannot be proved.  For to be able to do this, it is necessary the</p>
<p>moon and the tides should have been inquired into at the very</p>
<p>instant of the creation.</p>
<p>You will observe farther, that the sun, which in France is said to</p>
<p>have nothing to do in the affair, comes in here for very near a</p>
<p>quarter of its assistance.  According to your Cartesians, everything</p>
<p>is performed by an impulsion, of which we have very little notion;</p>
<p>and according to Sir Isaac Newton, it is by an attraction, the cause</p>
<p>of which is as much unknown to us.  At Paris you imagine that the</p>
<p>earth is shaped like a melon, or of an oblique figure; at London it</p>
<p>has an oblate one.  A Cartesian declares that light exists in the</p>
<p>air; but a Newtonian asserts that it comes from the sun in six</p>
<p>minutes and a half.  The several operations of your chemistry are</p>
<p>performed by acids, alkalies and subtile matter; but attraction</p>
<p>prevails even in chemistry among the English.</p>
<p>The very essence of things is totally changed.  You neither are</p>
<p>agreed upon the definition of the soul, nor on that of matter.</p>
<p>Descartes, as I observed in my last, maintains that the soul is the</p>
<p>same thing with thought, and Mr. Locke has given a pretty good proof</p>
<p>of the contrary.</p>
<p>Descartes asserts farther, that extension alone constitutes matter,</p>
<p>but Sir Isaac adds solidity to it.</p>
<p>How furiously contradictory are these opinions!</p>
<p>&quot;Non nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites.&quot;</p>
<p>VIRGIL, Eclog. III.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tis not for us to end such great disputes.&quot;</p>
<p>This famous Newton, this destroyer of the Cartesian system, died in</p>
<p>March, anno 1727.  His countrymen honoured him in his lifetime, and</p>
<p>interred him as though he had been a king who had made his people</p>
<p>happy.</p>
<p>The English read with the highest satisfaction, and translated into</p>
<p>their tongue, the Elogium of Sir Isaac Newton, which M. de</p>
<p>Fontenelle spoke in the Academy of Sciences.  M. de Fontenelle</p>
<p>presides as judge over philosophers; and the English expected his</p>
<p>decision, as a solemn declaration of the superiority of the English</p>
<p>philosophy over that of the French.  But when it was found that this</p>
<p>gentleman had compared Descartes to Sir Isaac, the whole Royal</p>
<p>Society in London rose up in arms.  So far from acquiescing with M.</p>
<p>Fontenelle&#x27;s judgment, they criticised his discourse.  And even</p>
<p>several (who, however, were not the ablest philosophers in that</p>
<p>body) were offended at the comparison; and for no other reason but</p>
<p>because Descartes was a Frenchman.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that these two great men differed very much in</p>
<p>conduct, in fortune, and in philosophy.</p>
<p>Nature had indulged Descartes with a shining and strong imagination,</p>
<p>whence he became a very singular person both in private life and in</p>
<p>his manner of reasoning.  This imagination could not conceal itself</p>
<p>even in his philosophical works, which are everywhere adorned with</p>
<p>very shining, ingenious metaphors and figures.  Nature had almost</p>
<p>made him a poet; and indeed he wrote a piece of poetry for the</p>
<p>entertainment of Christina, Queen of Sweden, which however was</p>
<p>suppressed in honour to his memory.</p>
<p>He embraced a military life for some time, and afterwards becoming a</p>
<p>complete philosopher, he did not think the passion of love</p>
<p>derogatory to his character.  He had by his mistress a daughter</p>
<p>called Froncine, who died young, and was very much regretted by him.</p>
<p>Thus he experienced every passion incident to mankind.</p>
<p>He was a long time of opinion that it would be necessary for him to</p>
<p>fly from the society of his fellow creatures, and especially from</p>
<p>his native country, in order to enjoy the happiness of cultivating</p>
<p>his philosophical studies in full liberty.</p>
<p>Descartes was very right, for his contemporaries were not knowing</p>
<p>enough to improve and enlighten his understanding, and were capable</p>
<p>of little else than of giving him uneasiness.</p>
<p>He left France purely to go in search of truth, which was then</p>
<p>persecuted by the wretched philosophy of the schools.  However, he</p>
<p>found that reason was as much disguised and depraved in the</p>
<p>universities of Holland, into which he withdrew, as in his own</p>
<p>country.  For at the time that the French condemned the only</p>
<p>propositions of his philosophy which were true, he was persecuted by</p>
<p>the pretended philosophers of Holland, who understood him no better;</p>
<p>and who, having a nearer view of his glory, hated his person the</p>
<p>more, so that he was obliged to leave Utrecht.  Descartes was</p>
<p>injuriously accused of being an atheist, the last refuge of</p>
<p>religious scandal:  and he who had employed all the sagacity and</p>
<p>penetration of his genius, in searching for new proofs of the</p>
<p>existence of a God, was suspected to believe there was no such</p>
<p>Being.</p>
<p>Such a persecution from all sides, must necessarily suppose a most</p>
<p>exalted merit as well as a very distinguished reputation, and indeed</p>
<p>he possessed both.  Reason at that time darted a ray upon the world</p>
<p>through the gloom of the schools, and the prejudices of popular</p>
<p>superstition.  At last his name spread so universally, that the</p>
<p>French were desirous of bringing him back into his native country by</p>
<p>rewards, and accordingly offered him an annual pension of a thousand</p>
<p>crowns.  Upon these hopes Descartes returned to France; paid the</p>
<p>fees of his patent, which was sold at that time, but no pension was</p>
<p>settled upon him.  Thus disappointed, he returned to his solitude in</p>
<p>North Holland, where he again pursued the study of philosophy,</p>
<p>whilst the great Galileo, at fourscore years of age, was groaning in</p>
<p>the prisons of the Inquisition, only for having demonstrated the</p>
<p>earth&#x27;s motion.</p>
<p>At last Descartes was snatched from the world in the flower of his</p>
<p>age at Stockholm.  His death was owing to a bad regimen, and he</p>
<p>expired in the midst of some literati who were his enemies, and</p>
<p>under the hands of a physician to whom he was odious.</p>
<p>The progress of Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s life was quite different.  He</p>
<p>lived happy, and very much honoured in his native country, to the</p>
<p>age of fourscore and five years.</p>
<p>It was his peculiar felicity, not only to be born in a country of</p>
<p>liberty, but in an age when all scholastic impertinences were</p>
<p>banished from the world.  Reason alone was cultivated, and mankind</p>
<p>could only be his pupil, not his enemy.</p>
<p>One very singular difference in the lives of these two great men is,</p>
<p>that Sir Isaac, during the long course of years he enjoyed, was</p>
<p>never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common</p>
<p>frailties of mankind, nor ever had any commerce with women--a</p>
<p>circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who</p>
<p>attended him in his last moments.</p>
<p>We may admire Sir Isaac Newton on this occasion, but then we must</p>
<p>not censure Descartes.</p>
<p>The opinion that generally prevails in England with regard to these</p>
<p>new philosophers is, that the latter was a dreamer, and the former a</p>
<p>sage.</p>
<p>Very few people in England read Descartes, whose works indeed are</p>
<p>now useless.  On the other side, but a small number peruse those of</p>
<p>Sir Isaac, because to do this the student must be deeply skilled in</p>
<p>the mathematics, otherwise those works will be unintelligible to</p>
<p>him.  But notwithstanding this, these great men are the subject of</p>
<p>everyone&#x27;s discourse.  Sir Isaac Newton is allowed every advantage,</p>
<p>whilst Descartes is not indulged a single one.  According to some,</p>
<p>it is to the former that we owe the discovery of a vacuum, that the</p>
<p>air is a heavy body, and the invention of telescopes.  In a word,</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton is here as the Hercules of fabulous story, to whom</p>
<p>the ignorant ascribed all the feats of ancient heroes.</p>
<p>In a critique that was made in London on Mr. de Fontenelle&#x27;s</p>
<p>discourse, the writer presumed to assert that Descartes was not a</p>
<p>great geometrician.  Those who make such a declaration may justly be</p>
<p>reproached with flying in their master&#x27;s face.  Descartes extended</p>
<p>the limits of geometry as far beyond the place where he found them,</p>
<p>as Sir Isaac did after him.  The former first taught the method of</p>
<p>expressing curves by equations.  This geometry which, thanks to him</p>
<p>for it, is now grown common, was so abstruse in his time, that not</p>
<p>so much as one professor would undertake to explain it; and Schotten</p>
<p>in Holland, and Format in France, were the only men who understood</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>He applied this geometrical and inventive genius to dioptrics,</p>
<p>which, when treated of by him, became a new art.  And if he was</p>
<p>mistaken in some things, the reason of that is, a man who discovers</p>
<p>a new tract of land cannot at once know all the properties of the</p>
<p>soil.  Those who come after him, and make these lands fruitful, are</p>
<p>at least obliged to him for the discovery.  I will not deny but that</p>
<p>there are innumerable errors in the rest of Descartes&#x27; works.</p>
<p>Geometry was a guide he himself had in some measure fashioned, which</p>
<p>would have conducted him safely through the several paths of natural</p>
<p>philosophy.  Nevertheless, he at last abandoned this guide, and gave</p>
<p>entirely into the humour of forming hypotheses; and then philosophy</p>
<p>was no more than an ingenious romance, fit only to amuse the</p>
<p>ignorant.  He was mistaken in the nature of the soul, in the proofs</p>
<p>of the existence of a God, in matter, in the laws of motion, and in</p>
<p>the nature of light.  He admitted innate ideas, he invented new</p>
<p>elements, he created a world; he made man according to his own</p>
<p>fancy; and it is justly said, that the man of Descartes is, in fact,</p>
<p>that of Descartes only, very different from the real one.</p>
<p>He pushed his metaphysical errors so far, as to declare that two and</p>
<p>two make four for no other reason but because God would have it so.</p>
<p>However, it will not be making him too great a compliment if we</p>
<p>affirm that he was valuable even in his mistakes.  He deceived</p>
<p>himself; but then it was at least in a methodical way.  He destroyed</p>
<p>all the absurd chimeras with which youth had been infatuated for two</p>
<p>thousand years.  He taught his contemporaries how to reason, and</p>
<p>enabled them to employ his own weapons against himself.  If</p>
<p>Descartes did not pay in good money, he however did great service in</p>
<p>crying down that of a base alloy.</p>
<p>I indeed believe that very few will presume to compare his</p>
<p>philosophy in any respect with that of Sir Isaac Newton.  The former</p>
<p>is an essay, the latter a masterpiece.  But then the man who first</p>
<p>brought us to the path of truth, was perhaps as great a genius as he</p>
<p>who afterwards conducted us through it.</p>
<p>Descartes gave sight to the blind.  These saw the errors of</p>
<p>antiquity and of the sciences.  The path he struck out is since</p>
<p>become boundless.  Rohault&#x27;s little work was, during some years, a</p>
<p>complete system of physics; but now all the Transactions of the</p>
<p>several academies in Europe put together do not form so much as the</p>
<p>beginning of a system.  In fathoming this abyss no bottom has been</p>
<p>found.  We are now to examine what discoveries Sir Isaac Newton has</p>
<p>made in it.</p>
<p>LETTER XV.--ON ATTRACTION</p>
<p>The discoveries which gained Sir Isaac Newton so universal a</p>
<p>reputation, relate to the system of the world, to light, to</p>
<p>geometrical infinities; and, lastly, to chronology, with which he</p>
<p>used to amuse himself after the fatigue of his severer studies.</p>
<p>I will now acquaint you (without prolixity if possible) with the few</p>
<p>things I have been able to comprehend of all these sublime ideas.</p>
<p>With regard to the system of our world, disputes were a long time</p>
<p>maintained, on the cause that turns the planets, and keeps them in</p>
<p>their orbits:  and on those causes which make all bodies here below</p>
<p>descend towards the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>The system of Descartes, explained and improved since his time,</p>
<p>seemed to give a plausible reason for all those phenomena; and this</p>
<p>reason seemed more just, as it is simple and intelligible to all</p>
<p>capacities.  But in philosophy, a student ought to doubt of the</p>
<p>things he fancies he understands too easily, as much as of those he</p>
<p>does not understand.</p>
<p>Gravity, the falling of accelerated bodies on the earth, the</p>
<p>revolution of the planets in their orbits, their rotations round</p>
<p>their axis, all this is mere motion.  Now motion cannot perhaps be</p>
<p>conceived any otherwise than by impulsion; therefore all those</p>
<p>bodies must be impelled.  But by what are they impelled?  All space</p>
<p>is full, it therefore is filled with a very subtile matter, since</p>
<p>this is imperceptible to us; this matter goes from west to east,</p>
<p>since all the planets are carried from west to east.  Thus from</p>
<p>hypothesis to hypothesis, from one appearance to another,</p>
<p>philosophers have imagined a vast whirlpool of subtile matter, in</p>
<p>which the planets are carried round the sun:  they also have created</p>
<p>another particular vortex which floats in the great one, and which</p>
<p>turns daily round the planets.  When all this is done, it is</p>
<p>pretended that gravity depends on this diurnal motion; for, say</p>
<p>these, the velocity of the subtile matter that turns round our</p>
<p>little vortex, must be seventeen times more rapid than that of the</p>
<p>earth; or, in case its velocity is seventeen times greater than that</p>
<p>of the earth, its centrifugal force must be vastly greater, and</p>
<p>consequently impel all bodies towards the earth.  This is the cause</p>
<p>of gravity, according to the Cartesian system.  But the theorist,</p>
<p>before he calculated the centrifugal force and velocity of the</p>
<p>subtile matter, should first have been certain that it existed.</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton, seems to have destroyed all these great and little</p>
<p>vortices, both that which carries the planets round the sun, as well</p>
<p>as the other which supposes every planet to turn on its own axis.</p>
<p>First, with regard to the pretended little vortex of the earth, it</p>
<p>is demonstrated that it must lose its motion by insensible degrees;</p>
<p>it is demonstrated, that if the earth swims in a fluid, its density</p>
<p>must be equal to that of the earth; and in case its density be the</p>
<p>same, all the bodies we endeavour to move must meet with an</p>
<p>insuperable resistance.</p>
<p>With regard to the great vortices, they are still more chimerical,</p>
<p>and it is impossible to make them agree with Kepler&#x27;s law, the truth</p>
<p>of which has been demonstrated.  Sir Isaac shows, that the</p>
<p>revolution of the fluid in which Jupiter is supposed to be carried,</p>
<p>is not the same with regard to the revolution of the fluid of the</p>
<p>earth, as the revolution of Jupiter with respect to that of the</p>
<p>earth.  He proves, that as the planets make their revolutions in</p>
<p>ellipses, and consequently being at a much greater distance one from</p>
<p>the other in their Aphelia, and a little nearer in their Perihelia;</p>
<p>the earth&#x27;s velocity, for instance, ought to be greater when it is</p>
<p>nearer Venus and Mars, because the fluid that carries it along,</p>
<p>being then more pressed, ought to have a greater motion; and yet it</p>
<p>is even then that the earth&#x27;s motion is slower.</p>
<p>He proves that there is no such thing as a celestial matter which</p>
<p>goes from west to east since the comets traverse those spaces,</p>
<p>sometimes from east to west, and at other times from north to south.</p>
<p>In fine, the better to resolve, if possible, every difficulty, he</p>
<p>proves, and even by experiments, that it is impossible there should</p>
<p>be a plenum; and brings back the vacuum, which Aristotle and</p>
<p>Descartes had banished from the world.</p>
<p>Having by these and several other arguments destroyed the Cartesian</p>
<p>vortices, he despaired of ever being able to discover whether there</p>
<p>is a secret principle in nature which, at the same time, is the</p>
<p>cause of the motion of all celestial bodies, and that of gravity on</p>
<p>the earth.  But being retired in 1666, upon account of the Plague,</p>
<p>to a solitude near Cambridge; as he was walking one day in his</p>
<p>garden, and saw some fruits fall from a tree, he fell into a</p>
<p>profound meditation on that gravity, the cause of which had so long</p>
<p>been sought, but in vain, by all the philosophers, whilst the vulgar</p>
<p>think there is nothing mysterious in it.  He said to himself; that</p>
<p>from what height soever in our hemisphere, those bodies might</p>
<p>descend, their fall would certainly be in the progression discovered</p>
<p>by Galileo; and the spaces they run through would be as the square</p>
<p>of the times.  Why may not this power which causes heavy bodies to</p>
<p>descend, and is the same without any sensible diminution at the</p>
<p>remotest distance from the centre of the earth, or on the summits of</p>
<p>the highest mountains, why, said Sir Isaac, may not this power</p>
<p>extend as high as the moon?  And in case its influence reaches so</p>
<p>far, is it not very probable that this power retains it in its</p>
<p>orbit, and determines its motion?  But in case the moon obeys this</p>
<p>principle (whatever it be) may we not conclude very naturally that</p>
<p>the rest of the planets are equally subject to it?  In case this</p>
<p>power exists (which besides is proved) it must increase in an</p>
<p>inverse ratio of the squares of the distances.  All, therefore, that</p>
<p>remains is, to examine how far a heavy body, which should fall upon</p>
<p>the earth from a moderate height, would go; and how far in the same</p>
<p>time, a body which should fall from the orbit of the moon, would</p>
<p>descend.  To find this, nothing is wanted but the measure of the</p>
<p>earth, and the distance of the moon from it.</p>
<p>Thus Sir Isaac Newton reasoned.  But at that time the English had</p>
<p>but a very imperfect measure of our globe, and depended on the</p>
<p>uncertain supposition of mariners, who computed a degree to contain</p>
<p>but sixty English miles, whereas it consists in reality of near</p>
<p>seventy.  As this false computation did not agree with the</p>
<p>conclusions which Sir Isaac intended to draw from them, he laid</p>
<p>aside this pursuit.  A half-learned philosopher, remarkable only for</p>
<p>his vanity, would have made the measure of the earth agree, anyhow,</p>
<p>with his system.  Sir Isaac, however, chose rather to quit the</p>
<p>researches he was then engaged in.  But after Mr. Picard had</p>
<p>measured the earth exactly, by tracing that meridian which redounds</p>
<p>so much to the honour of the French, Sir Isaac Newton resumed his</p>
<p>former reflections, and found his account in Mr. Picard&#x27;s</p>
<p>calculation.</p>
<p>A circumstance which has always appeared wonderful to me, is that</p>
<p>such sublime discoveries should have been made by the sole</p>
<p>assistance of a quadrant and a little arithmetic.</p>
<p>The circumference of the earth is 123,249,600 feet.  This, among</p>
<p>other things, is necessary to prove the system of attraction.</p>
<p>The instant we know the earth&#x27;s circumference, and the distance of</p>
<p>the moon, we know that of the moon&#x27;s orbit, and the diameter of this</p>
<p>orbit.  The moon performs its revolution in that orbit in twenty-</p>
<p>seven days, seven hours, forty-three minutes.  It is demonstrated,</p>
<p>that the moon in its mean motion makes an hundred and fourscore and</p>
<p>seven thousand nine hundred and sixty feet (of Paris) in a minute.</p>
<p>It is likewise demonstrated, by a known theorem, that the central</p>
<p>force which should make a body fall from the height of the moon,</p>
<p>would make its velocity no more than fifteen Paris feet in a minute</p>
<p>of time.  Now, if the law by which bodies gravitate and attract one</p>
<p>another in an inverse ratio to the squares of the distances be true,</p>
<p>if the same power acts according to that law throughout all nature,</p>
<p>it is evident that as the earth is sixty semi-diameters distant from</p>
<p>the moon, a heavy body must necessarily fall (on the earth) fifteen</p>
<p>feet in the first second, and fifty-four thousand feet in the first</p>
<p>minute.</p>
<p>Now a heavy body falls, in reality, fifteen feet in the first</p>
<p>second, and goes in the first minute fifty-four thousand feet, which</p>
<p>number is the square of sixty multiplied by fifteen.  Bodies,</p>
<p>therefore, gravitate in an inverse ratio of the squares of the</p>
<p>distances; consequently, what causes gravity on earth, and keeps the</p>
<p>moon in its orbit, is one and the same power; it being demonstrated</p>
<p>that the moon gravitates on the earth, which is the centre of its</p>
<p>particular motion, it is demonstrated that the earth and the moon</p>
<p>gravitate on the sun which is the centre of their annual motion.</p>
<p>The rest of the planets must be subject to this general law; and if</p>
<p>this law exists, these planets must follow the laws which Kepler</p>
<p>discovered.  All these laws, all these relations are indeed observed</p>
<p>by the planets with the utmost exactness; therefore, the power of</p>
<p>attraction causes all the planets to gravitate towards the sun, in</p>
<p>like manner as the moon gravitates towards our globe.</p>
<p>Finally, as in all bodies re-action is equal to action, it is</p>
<p>certain that the earth gravitates also towards the moon; and that</p>
<p>the sun gravitates towards both.  That every one of the satellites</p>
<p>of Saturn gravitates towards the other four, and the other four</p>
<p>towards it; all five towards Saturn, and Saturn towards all.  That</p>
<p>it is the same with regard to Jupiter; and that all these globes are</p>
<p>attracted by the sun, which is reciprocally attracted by them.</p>
<p>This power of gravitation acts proportionably to the quantity of</p>
<p>matter in bodies, a truth which Sir Isaac has demonstrated by</p>
<p>experiments.  This new discovery has been of use to show that the</p>
<p>sun (the centre of the planetary system) attracts them all in a</p>
<p>direct ratio of their quantity of matter combined with their</p>
<p>nearness.  From hence Sir Isaac, rising by degrees to discoveries</p>
<p>which seemed not to be formed for the human mind, is bold enough to</p>
<p>compute the quantity of matter contained in the sun and in every</p>
<p>planet; and in this manner shows, from the simple laws of mechanics,</p>
<p>that every celestial globe ought necessarily to be where it is</p>
<p>placed.</p>
<p>His bare principle of the laws of gravitation accounts for all the</p>
<p>apparent inequalities in the course of the celestial globes.  The</p>
<p>variations of the moon are a necessary consequence of those laws.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reason is evidently seen why the nodes of the moon</p>
<p>perform their revolutions in nineteen years, and those of the earth</p>
<p>in about twenty-six thousand.  The several appearances observed in</p>
<p>the tides are also a very simple effect of this attraction.  The</p>
<p>proximity of the moon, when at the full, and when it is new, and its</p>
<p>distance in the quadratures or quarters, combined with the action of</p>
<p>the sun, exhibit a sensible reason why the ocean swells and sinks.</p>
<p>After having shown by his sublime theory the course and inequalities</p>
<p>of the planets, he subjects comets to the same law.  The orbit of</p>
<p>these fires (unknown for so great a series of years), which was the</p>
<p>terror of mankind and the rock against which philosophy split,</p>
<p>placed by Aristotle below the moon, and sent back by Descartes above</p>
<p>the sphere of Saturn, is at last placed in its proper seat by Sir</p>
<p>Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>He proves that comets are solid bodies which move in the sphere of</p>
<p>the sun&#x27;s activity, and that they describe an ellipsis so very</p>
<p>eccentric, and so near to parabolas, that certain comets must take</p>
<p>up above five hundred years in their revolution.</p>
<p>The learned Dr. Halley is of opinion that the comet seen in 1680 is</p>
<p>the same which appeared in Julius Caesar&#x27;s time.  This shows more</p>
<p>than any other that comets are hard, opaque bodies; for it descended</p>
<p>so near to the sun, as to come within a sixth part of the diameter</p>
<p>of this planet from it, and consequently might have contracted a</p>
<p>degree of heat two thousand times stronger than that of red-hot</p>
<p>iron; and would have been soon dispersed in vapour, had it not been</p>
<p>a firm, dense body.  The guessing the course of comets began then to</p>
<p>be very much in vogue.  The celebrated Bernoulli concluded by his</p>
<p>system that the famous comet of 1680 would appear again the 17th of</p>
<p>May, 1719.  Not a single astronomer in Europe went to bed that</p>
<p>night.  However, they needed not to have broke their rest, for the</p>
<p>famous comet never appeared.  There is at least more cunning, if not</p>
<p>more certainty, in fixing its return to so remote a distance as five</p>
<p>hundred and seventy-five years.  As to Mr. Whiston, he affirmed very</p>
<p>seriously that in the time of the Deluge a comet overflowed the</p>
<p>terrestrial globe.  And he was so unreasonable as to wonder that</p>
<p>people laughed at him for making such an assertion.  The ancients</p>
<p>were almost in the same way of thinking with Mr. Whiston, and</p>
<p>fancied that comets were always the forerunners of some great</p>
<p>calamity which was to befall mankind.  Sir Isaac Newton, on the</p>
<p>contrary, suspected that they are very beneficent, and that vapours</p>
<p>exhale from them merely to nourish and vivify the planets, which</p>
<p>imbibe in their course the several particles the sun has detached</p>
<p>from the comets, an opinion which, at least, is more probable than</p>
<p>the former.  But this is not all.  If this power of gravitation or</p>
<p>attraction acts on all the celestial globes, it acts undoubtedly on</p>
<p>the several parts of these globes.  For in case bodies attract one</p>
<p>another in proportion to the quantity of matter contained in them,</p>
<p>it can only be in proportion to the quantity of their parts; and if</p>
<p>this power is found in the whole, it is undoubtedly in the half; in</p>
<p>the quarters in the eighth part, and so on in infinitum.</p>
<p>This is attraction, the great spring by which all Nature is moved.</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton, after having demonstrated the existence of this</p>
<p>principle, plainly foresaw that its very name would offend; and,</p>
<p>therefore, this philosopher, in more places than one of his books,</p>
<p>gives the reader some caution about it.  He bids him beware of</p>
<p>confounding this name with what the ancients called occult</p>
<p>qualities, but to be satisfied with knowing that there is in all</p>
<p>bodies a central force, which acts to the utmost limits of the</p>
<p>universe, according to the invariable laws of mechanics.</p>
<p>It is surprising, after the solemn protestations Sir Isaac made,</p>
<p>that such eminent men as Mr. Sorin and Mr. de Fontenelle should have</p>
<p>imputed to this great philosopher the verbal and chimerical way of</p>
<p>reasoning of the Aristotelians; Mr. Sorin in the Memoirs of the</p>
<p>Academy of 1709, and Mr. de Fontenelle in the very eulogium of Sir</p>
<p>Isaac Newton.</p>
<p>Most of the French (the learned and others) have repeated this</p>
<p>reproach.  These are for ever crying out, &quot;Why did he not employ the</p>
<p>word iMPULSION, which is so well understood, rather than that of</p>
<p>ATTRACTION, which is unintelligible?&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Isaac might have answered these critics thus: --&quot;First, you have</p>
<p>as imperfect an idea of the word impulsion as of that of attraction;</p>
<p>and in case you cannot conceive how one body tends towards the</p>
<p>centre of another body, neither can you conceive by what power one</p>
<p>body can impel another.</p>
<p>&quot;Secondly, I could not admit of impulsion; for to do this I must</p>
<p>have known that a celestial matter was the agent.  But so far from</p>
<p>knowing that there is any such matter, I have proved it to be merely</p>
<p>imaginary.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirdly, I use the word attraction for no other reason but to</p>
<p>express an effect which I discovered in Nature--a certain and</p>
<p>indisputable effect of an unknown principle--a quality inherent in</p>
<p>matter, the cause of which persons of greater abilities than I can</p>
<p>pretend to may, if they can, find out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What have you, then, taught us?&quot; will these people say further;</p>
<p>&quot;and to what purpose are so many calculations to tell us what you</p>
<p>yourself do not comprehend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have taught you,&quot; may Sir Isaac rejoin, &quot;that all bodies</p>
<p>gravitate towards one another in proportion to their quantity of</p>
<p>matter; that these central forces alone keep the planets and comets</p>
<p>in their orbits, and cause them to move in the proportion before set</p>
<p>down.  I demonstrate to you that it is impossible there should be</p>
<p>any other cause which keeps the planets in their orbits than that</p>
<p>general phenomenon of gravity.  For heavy bodies fall on the earth</p>
<p>according to the proportion demonstrated of central forces; and the</p>
<p>planets finishing their course according to these same proportions,</p>
<p>in case there were another power that acted upon all those bodies,</p>
<p>it would either increase their velocity or change their direction.</p>
<p>Now, not one of those bodies ever has a single degree of motion or</p>
<p>velocity, or has any direction but what is demonstrated to be the</p>
<p>effect of the central forces.  Consequently it is impossible there</p>
<p>should be any other principle.&quot;</p>
<p>Give me leave once more to introduce Sir Isaac speaking.  Shall he</p>
<p>not be allowed to say? &quot;My case and that of the ancients is very</p>
<p>different.  These saw, for instance, water ascend in pumps, and</p>
<p>said, &#x27;The water rises because it abhors a vacuum.&#x27;  But with regard</p>
<p>to myself; I am in the case of a man who should have first observed</p>
<p>that water ascends in pumps, but should leave others to explain the</p>
<p>cause of this effect.  The anatomist, who first declared that the</p>
<p>motion of the arm is owing to the contraction of the muscles, taught</p>
<p>mankind an indisputable truth.  But are they less obliged to him</p>
<p>because he did not know the reason why the muscles contract?  The</p>
<p>cause of the elasticity of the air is unknown, but he who first</p>
<p>discovered this spring performed a very signal service to natural</p>
<p>philosophy.  The spring that I discovered was more hidden and more</p>
<p>universal, and for that very reason mankind ought to thank me the</p>
<p>more.  I have discovered a new property of matter--one of the</p>
<p>secrets of the Creator--and have calculated and discovered the</p>
<p>effects of it.  After this, shall people quarrel with me about the</p>
<p>name I give it?&quot;</p>
<p>Vortices may be called an occult quality, because their existence</p>
<p>was never proved.  Attraction, on the contrary, is a real thing,</p>
<p>because its effects are demonstrated, and the proportions of it are</p>
<p>calculated.  The cause of this cause is among the Arcana of the</p>
<p>Almighty.</p>
<p>&quot;Precedes huc, et non amplius.&quot;</p>
<p>(Thus far shalt thou go, and no farther.)</p>
<p>LETTER XVI.--ON SIR ISAAC NEWTON&#x27;S OPTICS</p>
<p>The philosophers of the last age found out a new universe; and a</p>
<p>circumstance which made its discovery more difficult was that no one</p>
<p>had so much as suspected its existence.  The most sage and judicious</p>
<p>were of opinion that it was a frantic rashness to dare so much as to</p>
<p>imagine that it was possible to guess the laws by which the</p>
<p>celestial bodies move and the manner how light acts.  Galileo, by</p>
<p>his astronomical discoveries, Kepler, by his calculation, Descartes</p>
<p>(at least, in his dioptrics), and Sir Isaac Newton, in all his</p>
<p>works, severally saw the mechanism of the springs of the world.  The</p>
<p>geometricians have subjected infinity to the laws of calculation.</p>
<p>The circulation of the blood in animals, and of the sap in</p>
<p>vegetables, have changed the face of Nature with regard to us.  A</p>
<p>new kind of existence has been given to bodies in the air-pump.  By</p>
<p>the assistance of telescopes bodies have been brought nearer to one</p>
<p>another.  Finally, the several discoveries which Sir Isaac Newton</p>
<p>has made on light are equal to the boldest things which the</p>
<p>curiosity of man could expect after so many philosophical novelties.</p>
<p>Till Antonio de Dominis the rainbow was considered as an</p>
<p>inexplicable miracle.  This philosopher guessed that it was a</p>
<p>necessary effect of the sun and rain.  Descartes gained immortal</p>
<p>fame by his mathematical explication of this so natural a</p>
<p>phenomenon.  He calculated the reflections and refractions of light</p>
<p>in drops of rain.  And his sagacity on this occasion was at that</p>
<p>time looked upon as next to divine.</p>
<p>But what would he have said had it been proved to him that he was</p>
<p>mistaken in the nature of light; that he had not the least reason to</p>
<p>maintain that it is a globular body?  That it is false to assert</p>
<p>that this matter, spreading itself through the whole, waits only to</p>
<p>be projected forward by the sun, in order to be put in action, in</p>
<p>like manner as a long staff acts at one end when pushed forward by</p>
<p>the other.  That light is certainly darted by the sun; in fine, that</p>
<p>light is transmitted from the sun to the earth in about seven</p>
<p>minutes, though a cannonball, which were not to lose any of its</p>
<p>velocity, could not go that distance in less than twenty-five years.</p>
<p>How great would have been his astonishment had he been told that</p>
<p>light does not reflect directly by impinging against the solid parts</p>
<p>of bodies, that bodies are not transparent when they have large</p>
<p>pores, and that a man should arise who would demonstrate all these</p>
<p>paradoxes, and anatomise a single ray of light with more dexterity</p>
<p>than the ablest artist dissects a human body.  This man is come.</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated to the eye, by the bare assistance</p>
<p>of the prism, that light is a composition of coloured rays, which,</p>
<p>being united, form white colour.  A single ray is by him divided</p>
<p>into seven, which all fall upon a piece of linen, or a sheet of</p>
<p>white paper, in their order, one above the other, and at unequal</p>
<p>distances.  The first is red, the second orange, the third yellow,</p>
<p>the fourth green, the fifth blue, the sixth indigo, the seventh a</p>
<p>violet-purple.  Each of these rays, transmitted afterwards by a</p>
<p>hundred other prisms, will never change the colour it bears; in like</p>
<p>manner, as gold, when completely purged from its dross, will never</p>
<p>change afterwards in the crucible.  As a superabundant proof that</p>
<p>each of these elementary rays has inherently in itself that which</p>
<p>forms its colour to the eye, take a small piece of yellow wood, for</p>
<p>instance, and set it in the ray of a red colour; this wood will</p>
<p>instantly be tinged red.  But set it in the ray of a green colour,</p>
<p>it assumes a green colour, and so of all the rest.</p>
<p>From what cause, therefore, do colours arise in Nature?  It is</p>
<p>nothing but the disposition of bodies to reflect the rays of a</p>
<p>certain order and to absorb all the rest.</p>
<p>What, then, is this secret disposition?  Sir Isaac Newton</p>
<p>demonstrates that it is nothing more than the density of the small</p>
<p>constituent particles of which a body is composed.  And how is this</p>
<p>reflection performed?  It was supposed to arise from the rebounding</p>
<p>of the rays, in the same manner as a ball on the surface of a solid</p>
<p>body.  But this is a mistake, for Sir Isaac taught the astonished</p>
<p>philosophers that bodies are opaque for no other reason but because</p>
<p>their pores are large, that light reflects on our eyes from the very</p>
<p>bosom of those pores, that the smaller the pores of a body are the</p>
<p>more such a body is transparent.  Thus paper, which reflects the</p>
<p>light when dry, transmits it when oiled, because the oil, by filling</p>
<p>its pores, makes them much smaller.</p>
<p>It is there that examining the vast porosity of bodies, every</p>
<p>particle having its pores, and every particle of those particles</p>
<p>having its own, he shows we are not certain that there is a cubic</p>
<p>inch of solid matter in the universe, so far are we from conceiving</p>
<p>what matter is.  Having thus divided, as it were, light into its</p>
<p>elements, and carried the sagacity of his discoveries so far as to</p>
<p>prove the method of distinguishing compound colours from such as are</p>
<p>primitive, he shows that these elementary rays, separated by the</p>
<p>prism, are ranged in their order for no other reason but because</p>
<p>they are refracted in that very order; and it is this property</p>
<p>(unknown till he discovered it) of breaking or splitting in this</p>
<p>proportion; it is this unequal refraction of rays, this power of</p>
<p>refracting the red less than the orange colour, &amp;c., which he calls</p>
<p>the different refrangibility.  The most reflexible rays are the most</p>
<p>refrangible, and from hence he evinces that the same power is the</p>
<p>cause both of the reflection and refraction of light.</p>
<p>But all these wonders are merely but the opening of his discoveries.</p>
<p>He found out the secret to see the vibrations or fits of light which</p>
<p>come and go incessantly, and which either transmit light or reflect</p>
<p>it, according to the density of the parts they meet with.  He has</p>
<p>presumed to calculate the density of the particles of air necessary</p>
<p>between two glasses, the one flat, the other convex on one side, set</p>
<p>one upon the other, in order to operate such a transmission or</p>
<p>reflection, or to form such and such a colour.</p>
<p>From all these combinations he discovers the proportion in which</p>
<p>light acts on bodies and bodies act on light.</p>
<p>He saw light so perfectly, that he has determined to what degree of</p>
<p>perfection the art of increasing it, and of assisting our eyes by</p>
<p>telescopes, can be carried.</p>
<p>Descartes, from a noble confidence that was very excusable,</p>
<p>considering how strongly he was fired at the first discoveries he</p>
<p>made in an art which he almost first found out; Descartes, I say,</p>
<p>hoped to discover in the stars, by the assistance of telescopes,</p>
<p>objects as small as those we discern upon the earth.</p>
<p>But Sir Isaac has shown that dioptric telescopes cannot be brought</p>
<p>to a greater perfection, because of that refraction, and of that</p>
<p>very refrangibility, which at the same time that they bring objects</p>
<p>nearer to us, scatter too much the elementary rays.  He has</p>
<p>calculated in these glasses the proportion of the scattering of the</p>
<p>red and of the blue rays; and proceeding so far as to demonstrate</p>
<p>things which were not supposed even to exist, he examines the</p>
<p>inequalities which arise from the shape or figure of the glass, and</p>
<p>that which arises from the refrangibility.  He finds that the object</p>
<p>glass of the telescope being convex on one side and flat on the</p>
<p>other, in case the flat side be turned towards the object, the error</p>
<p>which arises from the construction and position of the glass is</p>
<p>above five thousand times less than the error which arises from the</p>
<p>refrangibility; and, therefore, that the shape or figure of the</p>
<p>glasses is not the cause why telescopes cannot be carried to a</p>
<p>greater perfection, but arises wholly from the nature of light.</p>
<p>For this reason he invented a telescope, which discovers objects by</p>
<p>reflection, and not by refraction.  Telescopes of this new kind are</p>
<p>very hard to make, and their use is not easy; but, according to the</p>
<p>English, a reflective telescope of but five feet has the same effect</p>
<p>as another of a hundred feet in length.</p>
<p>LETTER XVII.--ON INFINITES IN GEOMETRY, AND SIR ISAAC NEWTON&#x27;S</p>
<p>CHRONOLOGY</p>
<p>The labyrinth and abyss of infinity is also a new course Sir Isaac</p>
<p>Newton has gone through, and we are obliged to him for the clue, by</p>
<p>whose assistance we are enabled to trace its various windings.</p>
<p>Descartes got the start of him also in this astonishing invention.</p>
<p>He advanced with mighty steps in his geometry, and was arrived at</p>
<p>the very borders of infinity, but went no farther.  Dr. Wallis,</p>
<p>about the middle of the last century, was the first who reduced a</p>
<p>fraction by a perpetual division to an infinite series.</p>
<p>The Lord Brouncker employed this series to square the hyperbola.</p>
<p>Mercator published a demonstration of this quadrature; much about</p>
<p>which time Sir Isaac Newton, being then twenty-three years of age,</p>
<p>had invented a general method, to perform on all geometrical curves</p>
<p>what had just before been tried on the hyperbola.</p>
<p>It is to this method of subjecting everywhere infinity to</p>
<p>algebraical calculations, that the name is given of differential</p>
<p>calculations or of fluxions and integral calculation.  It is the art</p>
<p>of numbering and measuring exactly a thing whose existence cannot be</p>
<p>conceived.</p>
<p>And, indeed, would you not imagine that a man laughed at you who</p>
<p>should declare that there are lines infinitely great which form an</p>
<p>angle infinitely little?</p>
<p>That a right line, which is a right line so long as it is finite, by</p>
<p>changing infinitely little its direction, becomes an infinite curve;</p>
<p>and that a curve may become infinitely less than another curve?</p>
<p>That there are infinite squares, infinite cubes, and infinites of</p>
<p>infinites, all greater than one another, and the last but one of</p>
<p>which is nothing in comparison of the last?</p>
<p>All these things, which at first appear to be the utmost excess of</p>
<p>frenzy, are in reality an effort of the subtlety and extent of the</p>
<p>human mind, and the art of finding truths which till then had been</p>
<p>unknown.</p>
<p>This so bold edifice is even founded on simple ideas.  The business</p>
<p>is to measure the diagonal of a square, to give the area of a curve,</p>
<p>to find the square root of a number, which has none in common</p>
<p>arithmetic.  After all, the imagination ought not to be startled any</p>
<p>more at so many orders of infinites than at the so well-known</p>
<p>proposition, viz., that curve lines may always be made to pass</p>
<p>between a circle and a tangent; or at that other, namely, that</p>
<p>matter is divisible in infinitum.  These two truths have been</p>
<p>demonstrated many years, and are no less incomprehensible than the</p>
<p>things we have been speaking of.</p>
<p>For many years the invention of this famous calculation was denied</p>
<p>to Sir Isaac Newton.  In Germany Mr. Leibnitz was considered as the</p>
<p>inventor of the differences or moments, called fluxions, and Mr.</p>
<p>Bernouilli claimed the integral calculus.  However, Sir Isaac is now</p>
<p>thought to have first made the discovery, and the other two have the</p>
<p>glory of having once made the world doubt whether it was to be</p>
<p>ascribed to him or them.  Thus some contested with Dr. Harvey the</p>
<p>invention of the circulation of the blood, as others disputed with</p>
<p>Mr. Perrault that of the circulation of the sap.</p>
<p>Hartsocher and Leuwenhoek disputed with each other the honour of</p>
<p>having first seen the vermiculi of which mankind are formed.  This</p>
<p>Hartsocher also contested with Huygens the invention of a new method</p>
<p>of calculating the distance of a fixed star.  It is not yet known to</p>
<p>what philosopher we owe the invention of the cycloid.</p>
<p>Be this as it will, it is by the help of this geometry of infinites</p>
<p>that Sir Isaac Newton attained to the most sublime discoveries.  I</p>
<p>am now to speak of another work, which, though more adapted to the</p>
<p>capacity of the human mind, does nevertheless display some marks of</p>
<p>that creative genius with which Sir Isaac Newton was informed in all</p>
<p>his researches.  The work I mean is a chronology of a new kind, for</p>
<p>what province soever he undertook he was sure to change the ideas</p>
<p>and opinions received by the rest of men.</p>
<p>Accustomed to unravel and disentangle chaos, he was resolved to</p>
<p>convey at least some light into that of the fables of antiquity</p>
<p>which are blended and confounded with history, and fix an uncertain</p>
<p>chronology.  It is true that there is no family, city, or nation,</p>
<p>but endeavours to remove its original as far backward as possible.</p>
<p>Besides, the first historians were the most negligent in setting</p>
<p>down the eras:  books were infinitely less common than they are at</p>
<p>this time, and, consequently, authors being not so obnoxious to</p>
<p>censure, they therefore imposed upon the world with greater</p>
<p>impunity; and, as it is evident that these have related a great</p>
<p>number of fictitious particulars, it is probable enough that they</p>
<p>also gave us several false eras.</p>
<p>It appeared in general to Sir Isaac that the world was five hundred</p>
<p>years younger than chronologers declare it to be.  He grounds his</p>
<p>opinion on the ordinary course of Nature, and on the observations</p>
<p>which astronomers have made.</p>
<p>By the course of Nature we here understand the time that every</p>
<p>generation of men lives upon the earth.  The Egyptians first</p>
<p>employed this vague and uncertain method of calculating when they</p>
<p>began to write the beginning of their history.  These computed three</p>
<p>hundred and forty-one generations from Menes to Sethon; and, having</p>
<p>no fixed era, they supposed three generations to consist of a</p>
<p>hundred years.  In this manner they computed eleven thousand three</p>
<p>hundred and forty years from Menes&#x27;s reign to that of Sethon.</p>
<p>The Greeks before they counted by Olympiads followed the method of</p>
<p>the Egyptians, and even gave a little more extent to generations,</p>
<p>making each to consist of forty years.</p>
<p>Now, here, both the Egyptians and the Greeks made an erroneous</p>
<p>computation.  It is true, indeed, that, according to the usual</p>
<p>course of Nature, three generations last about a hundred and twenty</p>
<p>years; but three reigns are far from taking up so many.  It is very</p>
<p>evident that mankind in general live longer than kings are found to</p>
<p>reign, so that an author who should write a history in which there</p>
<p>were no dates fixed, and should know that nine kings had reigned</p>
<p>over a nation; such an historian would commit a great error should</p>
<p>he allow three hundred years to these nine monarchs.  Every</p>
<p>generation takes about thirty-six years; every reign is, one with</p>
<p>the other, about twenty.  Thirty kings of England have swayed the</p>
<p>sceptre from William the Conqueror to George I., the years of whose</p>
<p>reigns added together amount to six hundred and forty-eight years;</p>
<p>which, being divided equally among the thirty kings, give to every</p>
<p>one a reign of twenty-one years and a half very near.  Sixty-three</p>
<p>kings of France have sat upon the throne; these have, one with</p>
<p>another, reigned about twenty years each.  This is the usual course</p>
<p>of Nature.  The ancients, therefore, were mistaken when they</p>
<p>supposed the durations in general of reigns to equal that of</p>
<p>generations.  They, therefore, allowed too great a number of years,</p>
<p>and consequently some years must be subtracted from their</p>
<p>computation.</p>
<p>Astronomical observations seem to have lent a still greater</p>
<p>assistance to our philosopher.  He appears to us stronger when he</p>
<p>fights upon his own ground.</p>
<p>You know that the earth, besides its annual motion which carries it</p>
<p>round the sun from west to east in the space of a year, has also a</p>
<p>singular revolution which was quite unknown till within these late</p>
<p>years.  Its poles have a very slow retrograde motion from east to</p>
<p>west, whence it happens that their position every day does not</p>
<p>correspond exactly with the same point of the heavens.  This</p>
<p>difference, which is so insensible in a year, becomes pretty</p>
<p>considerable in time; and in threescore and twelve years the</p>
<p>difference is found to be of one degree, that is to say, the three</p>
<p>hundred and sixtieth part of the circumference of the whole heaven.</p>
<p>Thus after seventy-two years the colure of the vernal equinox which</p>
<p>passed through a fixed star, corresponds with another fixed star.</p>
<p>Hence it is that the sun, instead of being in that part of the</p>
<p>heavens in which the Ram was situated in the time of Hipparchus, is</p>
<p>found to correspond with that part of the heavens in which the Bull</p>
<p>was situated; and the Twins are placed where the Bull then stood.</p>
<p>All the signs have changed their situation, and yet we still retain</p>
<p>the same manner of speaking as the ancients did.  In this age we say</p>
<p>that the sun is in the Ram in the spring, from the same principle of</p>
<p>condescension that we say that the sun turns round.</p>
<p>Hipparchus was the first among the Greeks who observed some change</p>
<p>in the constellations with regard to the equinoxes, or rather who</p>
<p>learnt it from the Egyptians.  Philosophers ascribed this motion to</p>
<p>the stars; for in those ages people were far from imagining such a</p>
<p>revolution in the earth, which was supposed to be immovable in every</p>
<p>respect.  They therefore created a heaven in which they fixed the</p>
<p>several stars, and gave this heaven a particular motion by which it</p>
<p>was carried towards the east, whilst that all the stars seemed to</p>
<p>perform their diurnal revolution from east to west.  To this error</p>
<p>they added a second of much greater consequence, by imagining that</p>
<p>the pretended heaven of the fixed stars advanced one degree eastward</p>
<p>every hundred years.  In this manner they were no less mistaken in</p>
<p>their astronomical calculation than in their system of natural</p>
<p>philosophy.  As for instance, an astronomer in that age would have</p>
<p>said that the vernal equinox was in the time of such and such an</p>
<p>observation, in such a sign, and in such a star.  It has advanced</p>
<p>two degrees of each since the time that observation was made to the</p>
<p>present.  Now two degrees are equivalent to two hundred years;</p>
<p>consequently the astronomer who made that observation lived just so</p>
<p>many years before me.  It is certain that an astronomer who had</p>
<p>argued in this manner would have mistook just fifty-four years;</p>
<p>hence it is that the ancients, who were doubly deceived, made their</p>
<p>great year of the world, that is, the revolution of the whole</p>
<p>heavens, to consist of thirty-six thousand years.  But the moderns</p>
<p>are sensible that this imaginary revolution of the heaven of the</p>
<p>stars is nothing else than the revolution of the poles of the earth,</p>
<p>which is performed in twenty-five thousand nine hundred years.  It</p>
<p>may be proper to observe transiently in this place, that Sir Isaac,</p>
<p>by determining the figure of the earth, has very happily explained</p>
<p>the cause of this revolution.</p>
<p>All this being laid down, the only thing remaining to settle</p>
<p>chronology is to see through what star the colure of the equinoxes</p>
<p>passes, and where it intersects at this time the ecliptic in the</p>
<p>spring; and to discover whether some ancient writer does not tell us</p>
<p>in what point the ecliptic was intersected in his time, by the same</p>
<p>colure of the equinoxes.</p>
<p>Clemens Alexandrinus informs us, that Chiron, who went with the</p>
<p>Argonauts, observed the constellations at the time of that famous</p>
<p>expedition, and fixed the vernal equinox to the middle of the Ram;</p>
<p>the autumnal equinox to the middle of Libra; our summer solstice to</p>
<p>the middle of Cancer, and our winter solstice to the middle of</p>
<p>Capricorn.</p>
<p>A long time after the expedition of the Argonauts, and a year before</p>
<p>the Peloponnesian war, Methon observed that the point of the summer</p>
<p>solstice passed through the eighth degree of Cancer.</p>
<p>Now every sign of the zodiac contains thirty degrees.  In Chiron&#x27;s</p>
<p>time, the solstice was arrived at the middle of the sign, that is to</p>
<p>say to the fifteenth degree.  A year before the Peloponnesian war it</p>
<p>was at the eighth, and therefore it had retarded seven degrees.  A</p>
<p>degree is equivalent to seventy-two years; consequently, from the</p>
<p>beginning of the Peloponnesian war to the expedition of the</p>
<p>Argonauts, there is no more than an interval of seven times seventy-</p>
<p>two years, which make five hundred and four years, and not seven</p>
<p>hundred years as the Greeks computed.  Thus in comparing the</p>
<p>position of the heavens at this time with their position in that</p>
<p>age, we find that the expedition of the Argonauts ought to be placed</p>
<p>about nine hundred years before Christ, and not about fourteen</p>
<p>hundred; and consequently that the world is not so old by five</p>
<p>hundred years as it was generally supposed to be.  By this</p>
<p>calculation all the eras are drawn nearer, and the several events</p>
<p>are found to have happened later than is computed.  I do not know</p>
<p>whether this ingenious system will be favourably received; and</p>
<p>whether these notions will prevail so far with the learned, as to</p>
<p>prompt them to reform the chronology of the world.  Perhaps these</p>
<p>gentlemen would think it too great a condescension to allow one and</p>
<p>the same man the glory of having improved natural philosophy,</p>
<p>geometry, and history.  This would be a kind of universal monarchy,</p>
<p>with which the principle of self-love that is in man will scarce</p>
<p>suffer him to indulge his fellow-creature; and, indeed, at the same</p>
<p>time that some very great philosophers attacked Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s</p>
<p>attractive principle, others fell upon his chronological system.</p>
<p>Time that should discover to which of these the victory is due, may</p>
<p>perhaps only leave the dispute still more undetermined.</p>
<p>LETTER XVIII.--ON TRAGEDY</p>
<p>The English as well as the Spaniards were possessed of theatres at a</p>
<p>time when the French had no more than moving, itinerant stages.</p>
<p>Shakspeare, who was considered as the Corneille of the first-</p>
<p>mentioned nation, was pretty nearly contemporary with Lopez de Vega,</p>
<p>and he created, as it were, the English theatre.  Shakspeare boasted</p>
<p>a strong fruitful genius.  He was natural and sublime, but had not</p>
<p>so much as a single spark of good taste, or knew one rule of the</p>
<p>drama.  I will now hazard a random, but, at the same time, true</p>
<p>reflection, which is, that the great merit of this dramatic poet has</p>
<p>been the ruin of the English stage.  There are such beautiful, such</p>
<p>noble, such dreadful scenes in this writer&#x27;s monstrous farces, to</p>
<p>which the name of tragedy is given, that they have always been</p>
<p>exhibited with great success.  Time, which alone gives reputation to</p>
<p>writers, at last makes their very faults venerable.  Most of the</p>
<p>whimsical gigantic images of this poet, have, through length of time</p>
<p>(it being a hundred and fifty years since they were first drawn)</p>
<p>acquired a right of passing for sublime.  Most of the modern</p>
<p>dramatic writers have copied him; but the touches and descriptions</p>
<p>which are applauded in Shakspeare, are hissed at in these writers;</p>
<p>and you will easily believe that the veneration in which this author</p>
<p>is held, increases in proportion to the contempt which is shown to</p>
<p>the moderns.  Dramatic writers don&#x27;t consider that they should not</p>
<p>imitate him; and the ill-success of Shakspeare&#x27;s imitators produces</p>
<p>no other effect, than to make him be considered as inimitable.  You</p>
<p>remember that in the tragedy of Othello, Moor of Venice, a most</p>
<p>tender piece, a man strangles his wife on the stage, and that the</p>
<p>poor woman, whilst she is strangling, cries aloud that she dies very</p>
<p>unjustly.  You know that in Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, two grave-</p>
<p>diggers make a grave, and are all the time drinking, singing</p>
<p>ballads, and making humorous reflections (natural indeed enough to</p>
<p>persons of their profession) on the several skulls they throw up</p>
<p>with their spades; but a circumstance which will surprise you is,</p>
<p>that this ridiculous incident has been imitated.  In the reign of</p>
<p>King Charles II., which was that of politeness, and the Golden Age</p>
<p>of the liberal arts; Otway, in his Venice Preserved, introduces</p>
<p>Antonio the senator, and Naki, his courtesan, in the midst of the</p>
<p>horrors of the Marquis of Bedemar&#x27;s conspiracy.  Antonio, the</p>
<p>superannuated senator plays, in his mistress&#x27;s presence, all the</p>
<p>apish tricks of a lewd, impotent debauchee, who is quite frantic and</p>
<p>out of his senses.  He mimics a bull and a dog, and bites his</p>
<p>mistress&#x27;s legs, who kicks and whips him.  However, the players have</p>
<p>struck these buffooneries (which indeed were calculated merely for</p>
<p>the dregs of the people) out of Otway&#x27;s tragedy; but they have still</p>
<p>left in Shakspeare&#x27;s Julius Caesar the jokes of the Roman shoemakers</p>
<p>and cobblers, who are introduced in the same scene with Brutus and</p>
<p>Cassius.  You will undoubtedly complain, that those who have</p>
<p>hitherto discoursed with you on the English stage, and especially on</p>
<p>the celebrated Shakspeare, have taken notice only of his errors; and</p>
<p>that no one has translated any of those strong, those forcible</p>
<p>passages which atone for all his faults.  But to this I will answer,</p>
<p>that nothing is easier than to exhibit in prose all the silly</p>
<p>impertinences which a poet may have thrown out; but that it is a</p>
<p>very difficult task to translate his fine verses.  All your junior</p>
<p>academical sophs, who set up for censors of the eminent writers,</p>
<p>compile whole volumes; but methinks two pages which display some of</p>
<p>the beauties of great geniuses, are of infinitely more value than</p>
<p>all the idle rhapsodies of those commentators; and I will join in</p>
<p>opinion with all persons of good taste in declaring, that greater</p>
<p>advantage may be reaped from a dozen verses of Homer of Virgil, than</p>
<p>from all the critiques put together which have been made on those</p>
<p>two great poets.</p>
<p>I have ventured to translate some passages of the most celebrated</p>
<p>English poets, and shall now give you one from Shakspeare.  Pardon</p>
<p>the blemishes of the translation for the sake of the original; and</p>
<p>remember always that when you see a version, you see merely a faint</p>
<p>print of a beautiful picture.  I have made choice of part of the</p>
<p>celebrated soliloquy in Hamlet, which you may remember is as</p>
<p>follows:-</p>
<p>&quot;To be, or not to be? that is the question!</p>
<p>Whether &#x27;t is nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</p>
<p>And by opposing, end them?  To die! to sleep!</p>
<p>No more! and by a sleep to say we end</p>
<p>The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks</p>
<p>That flesh is heir to!  &#x27;Tis a consummation</p>
<p>Devoutly to be wished.  To die! to sleep!</p>
<p>To sleep; perchance to dream!  O, there&#x27;s the rub;</p>
<p>For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come</p>
<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
<p>Must give us pause.  There&#x27;s the respect</p>
<p>That makes calamity of so long life:</p>
<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
<p>The oppressor&#x27;s wrong, the poor man&#x27;s contumely,</p>
<p>The pangs of despised love, the law&#x27;s delay,</p>
<p>The insolence of office, and the spurns</p>
<p>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</p>
<p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>
<p>With a bare bodkin.  Who would fardels bear</p>
<p>To groan and sweat under a weary life,</p>
<p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>
<p>The undiscovered country, from whose bourn</p>
<p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will,</p>
<p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have,</p>
<p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
<p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</p>
<p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
<p>Is sicklied o&#x27;er with the pale cast of thought:</p>
<p>And enterprises of great weight and moment</p>
<p>With this regard their currents turn awry,</p>
<p>And lose the name of action--&quot;</p>
<p>My version of it runs thus:-</p>
<p>&quot;Demeure, il faut choisir et passer a l&#x27;instant</p>
<p>De la vie, a la mort, ou de l&#x27;etre au neant.</p>
<p>Dieux cruels, s&#x27;il en est, eclairez mon courage.</p>
<p>Faut-il vieillir courbe sous la main qui m&#x27;outrage,</p>
<p>Supporter, ou finir mon malheur et mon sort?</p>
<p>Qui suis je?  Qui m&#x27;arrete! et qu&#x27;est-ce que la mort?</p>
<p>C&#x27;est la fin de nos maux, c&#x27;est mon unique asile</p>
<p>Apres de longs transports, c&#x27;est un sommeil tranquile.</p>
<p>On s&#x27;endort, et tout meurt, mais un affreux reveil</p>
<p>Doit succeder peut etre aux douceurs du sommeil!</p>
<p>On nous menace, on dit que cette courte vie,</p>
<p>De tourmens eternels est aussi-tot suivie.</p>
<p>O mort! moment fatal! affreuse eternite!</p>
<p>Tout coeur a ton seul nom se glace epouvante.</p>
<p>Eh! qui pourroit sans toi supporter cette vie,</p>
<p>De nos pretres menteurs benir l&#x27;hypocrisie:</p>
<p>D&#x27;une indigne maitresse encenser les erreurs,</p>
<p>Ramper sous un ministre, adorer ses hauteurs;</p>
<p>Et montrer les langueurs de son ame abattue,</p>
<p>A des amis ingrats qui detournent la vue?</p>
<p>La mort seroit trop douce en ces extremitez,</p>
<p>Mais le scrupule parle, et nous crie, arretez;</p>
<p>Il defend a nos mains cet heureux homicide</p>
<p>Et d&#x27;un heros guerrier, fait un Chretien timide,&quot; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Do not imagine that I have translated Shakspeare in a servile</p>
<p>manner.  Woe to the writer who gives a literal version; who by</p>
<p>rendering every word of his original, by that very means enervates</p>
<p>the sense, and extinguishes all the fire of it.  It is on such an</p>
<p>occasion one may justly affirm, that the letter kills, but the</p>
<p>Spirit quickens.</p>
<p>Here follows another passage copied from a celebrated tragic writer</p>
<p>among the English.  It is Dryden, a poet in the reign of Charles</p>
<p>II.--a writer whose genius was too exuberant, and not accompanied</p>
<p>with judgment enough.  Had he written only a tenth part of the works</p>
<p>he left behind him, his character would have been conspicuous in</p>
<p>every part; but his great fault is his having endeavoured to be</p>
<p>universal.</p>
<p>The passage in question is as follows:-</p>
<p>&quot;When I consider life, &#x27;t is all a cheat,</p>
<p>Yet fooled by hope, men favour the deceit;</p>
<p>Trust on and think, to-morrow will repay;</p>
<p>To-morrow&#x27;s falser than the former day;</p>
<p>Lies more; and whilst it says we shall be blest</p>
<p>With some new joy, cuts off what we possessed;</p>
<p>Strange cozenage! none would live past years again,</p>
<p>Yet all hope pleasure in what yet remain,</p>
<p>And from the dregs of life think to receive</p>
<p>What the first sprightly running could not give.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m tired with waiting for this chymic gold,</p>
<p>Which fools us young, and beggars us when old.&quot;</p>
<p>I shall now give you my translation:-</p>
<p>&quot;De desseins en regrets et d&#x27;erreurs en desirs</p>
<p>Les mortals insenses promenent leur folie.</p>
<p>Dans des malheurs presents, dans l&#x27;espoir des plaisirs</p>
<p>Nous ne vivons jamais, nous attendons la vie.</p>
<p>Demain, demain, dit-on, va combler tous nos voeux.</p>
<p>Demain vient, et nous laisse encore plus malheureux.</p>
<p>Quelle est l&#x27;erreur, helas! du soin qui nous devore,</p>
<p>Nul de nous ne voudroit recommencer son cours.</p>
<p>De nos premiers momens nous maudissons l&#x27;aurore,</p>
<p>Et de la nuit qui vient nous attendons encore,</p>
<p>Ce qu&#x27;ont en vain promis les plus beaux de nos jours,&quot; &amp;c.</p>
<p>It is in these detached passages that the English have hitherto</p>
<p>excelled.  Their dramatic pieces, most of which are barbarous and</p>
<p>without decorum, order, or verisimilitude, dart such resplendent</p>
<p>flashes through this gleam, as amaze and astonish.  The style is too</p>
<p>much inflated, too unnatural, too closely copied from the Hebrew</p>
<p>writers, who abound so much with the Asiatic fustian.  But then it</p>
<p>must be also confessed that the stilts of the figurative style, on</p>
<p>which the English tongue is lifted up, raises the genius at the same</p>
<p>time very far aloft, though with an irregular pace.  The first</p>
<p>English writer who composed a regular tragedy, and infused a spirit</p>
<p>of elegance through every part of it, was the illustrious Mr.</p>
<p>Addison.  His &quot;Cato&quot; is a masterpiece, both with regard to the</p>
<p>diction and to the beauty and harmony of the numbers.  The character</p>
<p>of Cato is, in my opinion, vastly superior to that of Cornelia in</p>
<p>the &quot;Pompey&quot; of Corneille, for Cato is great without anything like</p>
<p>fustian, and Cornelia, who besides is not a necessary character,</p>
<p>tends sometimes to bombast.  Mr. Addison&#x27;s Cato appears to me the</p>
<p>greatest character that was ever brought upon any stage, but then</p>
<p>the rest of them do not correspond to the dignity of it, and this</p>
<p>dramatic piece, so excellently well writ, is disfigured by a dull</p>
<p>love plot, which spreads a certain languor over the whole, that</p>
<p>quite murders it.</p>
<p>The custom of introducing love at random and at any rate in the</p>
<p>drama passed from Paris to London about 1660, with our ribbons and</p>
<p>our perruques.  The ladies who adorn the theatrical circle there, in</p>
<p>like manner as in this city, will suffer love only to be the theme</p>
<p>of every conversation.  The judicious Mr. Addison had the effeminate</p>
<p>complaisance to soften the severity of his dramatic character, so as</p>
<p>to adapt it to the manners of the age, and, from an endeavour to</p>
<p>please, quite ruined a masterpiece in its kind.  Since his time the</p>
<p>drama is become more regular, the audience more difficult to be</p>
<p>pleased, and writers more correct and less bold.  I have seen some</p>
<p>new pieces that were written with great regularity, but which, at</p>
<p>the same time, were very flat and insipid.  One would think that the</p>
<p>English had been hitherto formed to produce irregular beauties only.</p>
<p>The shining monsters of Shakspeare give infinite more delight than</p>
<p>the judicious images of the moderns.  Hitherto the poetical genius</p>
<p>of the English resembles a tufted tree planted by the hand of</p>
<p>Nature, that throws out a thousand branches at random, and spreads</p>
<p>unequally, but with great vigour.  It dies if you attempt to force</p>
<p>its nature, and to lop and dress it in the same manner as the trees</p>
<p>of the Garden of Marli.</p>
<p>LETTER XIX.--ON COMEDY</p>
<p>I am surprised that the judicious and ingenious Mr. de Muralt, who</p>
<p>has published some letters on the English and French nations, should</p>
<p>have confined himself; in treating of comedy, merely to censure</p>
<p>Shadwell the comic writer.  This author was had in pretty great</p>
<p>contempt in Mr. de Muralt&#x27;s time, and was not the poet of the polite</p>
<p>part of the nation.  His dramatic pieces, which pleased some time in</p>
<p>acting, were despised by all persons of taste, and might be compared</p>
<p>to many plays which I have seen in France, that drew crowds to the</p>
<p>play-house, at the same time that they were intolerable to read; and</p>
<p>of which it might be said, that the whole city of Paris exploded</p>
<p>them, and yet all flocked to see them represented on the stage.</p>
<p>Methinks Mr. de Muralt should have mentioned an excellent comic</p>
<p>writer (living when he was in England), I mean Mr. Wycherley, who</p>
<p>was a long time known publicly to be happy in the good graces of the</p>
<p>most celebrated mistress of King Charles II.  This gentleman, who</p>
<p>passed his life among persons of the highest distinction, was</p>
<p>perfectly well acquainted with their lives and their follies, and</p>
<p>painted them with the strongest pencil, and in the truest colours.</p>
<p>He has drawn a misanthrope or man-hater, in imitation of that of</p>
<p>Moliere.  All Wycherley&#x27;s strokes are stronger and bolder than those</p>
<p>of our misanthrope, but then they are less delicate, and the rules</p>
<p>of decorum are not so well observed in this play.  The English</p>
<p>writer has corrected the only defect that is in Moliere&#x27;s comedy,</p>
<p>the thinness of the plot, which also is so disposed that the</p>
<p>characters in it do not enough raise our concern.  The English</p>
<p>comedy affects us, and the contrivance of the plot is very</p>
<p>ingenious, but at the same time it is too bold for the French</p>
<p>manners.  The fable is this:- A captain of a man-of-war, who is very</p>
<p>brave, open-hearted, and inflamed with a spirit of contempt for all</p>
<p>mankind, has a prudent, sincere friend, whom he yet is suspicious</p>
<p>of; and a mistress that loves him with the utmost excess of passion.</p>
<p>The captain so far from returning her love, will not even condescend</p>
<p>to look upon her, but confides entirely in a false friend, who is</p>
<p>the most worthless wretch living.  At the same time he has given his</p>
<p>heart to a creature, who is the greatest coquette and the most</p>
<p>perfidious of her sex, and he is so credulous as to be confident she</p>
<p>is a Penelope, and his false friend a Cato.  He embarks on board his</p>
<p>ship in order to go and fight the Dutch, having left all his money,</p>
<p>his jewels, and everything he had in the world to this virtuous</p>
<p>creature, whom at the same time he recommends to the care of his</p>
<p>supposed faithful friend.  Nevertheless the real man of honour, whom</p>
<p>he suspects so unaccountably, goes on board the ship with him, and</p>
<p>the mistress, on whom he would not bestow so much as one glance,</p>
<p>disguises herself in the habit of a page, and is with him the whole</p>
<p>voyage, without his once knowing that she is of a sex different from</p>
<p>that she attempts to pass for, which, by the way, is not over</p>
<p>natural.</p>
<p>The captain having blown up his own ship in an engagement, returns</p>
<p>to England abandoned and undone, accompanied by his page and his</p>
<p>friend, without knowing the friendship of the one or the tender</p>
<p>passion of the other.  Immediately he goes to the jewel among women,</p>
<p>who he expected had preserved her fidelity to him and the treasure</p>
<p>he had left in her hands.  He meets with her indeed, but married to</p>
<p>the honest knave in whom he had reposed so much confidence, and</p>
<p>finds she had acted as treacherously with regard to the casket he</p>
<p>had entrusted her with.  The captain can scarce think it possible</p>
<p>that a woman of virtue and honour can act so vile a part; but to</p>
<p>convince him still more of the reality of it, this very worthy lady</p>
<p>falls in love with the little page, and will force him to her</p>
<p>embraces.  But as it is requisite justice should be done, and that</p>
<p>in a dramatic piece virtue ought to be rewarded and vice punished,</p>
<p>it is at last found that the captain takes his page&#x27;s place, and</p>
<p>lies with his faithless mistress, cuckolds his treacherous friend,</p>
<p>thrusts his sword through his body, recovers his casket, and marries</p>
<p>his page.  You will observe that this play is also larded with a</p>
<p>petulant, litigious old woman (a relation of the captain), who is</p>
<p>the most comical character that was ever brought upon the stage.</p>
<p>Wycherley has also copied from Moliere another play, of as singular</p>
<p>and bold a cast, which is a kind of Ecole des Femmes, or, School for</p>
<p>Married Women.</p>
<p>The principal character in this comedy is one Homer, a sly fortune</p>
<p>hunter, and the terror of all the City husbands.  This fellow, in</p>
<p>order to play a surer game, causes a report to be spread, that in</p>
<p>his last illness, the surgeons had found it necessary to have him</p>
<p>made a eunuch.  Upon his appearing in this noble character, all the</p>
<p>husbands in town flock to him with their wives, and now poor Homer</p>
<p>is only puzzled about his choice.  However, he gives the preference</p>
<p>particularly to a little female peasant, a very harmless, innocent</p>
<p>creature, who enjoys a fine flush of health, and cuckolds her</p>
<p>husband with a simplicity that has infinitely more merit than the</p>
<p>witty malice of the most experienced ladies.  This play cannot</p>
<p>indeed be called the school of good morals, but it is certainly the</p>
<p>school of wit and true humour.</p>
<p>Sir John Vanbrugh has written several comedies, which are more</p>
<p>humorous than those of Mr. Wycherley, but not so ingenious.  Sir</p>
<p>John was a man of pleasure, and likewise a poet and an architect.</p>
<p>The general opinion is, that he is as sprightly in his writings as</p>
<p>he is heavy in his buildings.  It is he who raised the famous Castle</p>
<p>of Blenheim, a ponderous and lasting monument of our unfortunate</p>
<p>Battle of Hochstet.  Were the apartments but as spacious as the</p>
<p>walls are thick, this castle would be commodious enough.  Some wag,</p>
<p>in an epitaph he made on Sir John Vanbrugh, has these lines:-</p>
<p>&quot;Earth lie light on him, for he</p>
<p>Laid many a heavy load on thee.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir John having taken a tour into France before the glorious war</p>
<p>that broke out in 1701, was thrown into the Bastille, and detained</p>
<p>there for some time, without being ever able to discover the motive</p>
<p>which had prompted our ministry to indulge him with this mark of</p>
<p>their distinction.  He wrote a comedy during his confinement; and a</p>
<p>circumstance which appears to me very extraordinary is, that we</p>
<p>don&#x27;t meet with so much as a single satirical stroke against the</p>
<p>country in which he had been so injuriously treated.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Congreve raised the glory of comedy to a greater height</p>
<p>than any English writer before or since his time.  He wrote only a</p>
<p>few plays, but they are all excellent in their kind.  The laws of</p>
<p>the drama are strictly observed in them; they abound with characters</p>
<p>all which are shadowed with the utmost delicacy, and we don&#x27;t meet</p>
<p>with so much as one low or coarse jest.  The language is everywhere</p>
<p>that of men of honour, but their actions are those of knaves--a</p>
<p>proof that he was perfectly well acquainted with human nature, and</p>
<p>frequented what we call polite company.  He was infirm and come to</p>
<p>the verge of life when I knew him.  Mr. Congreve had one defect,</p>
<p>which was his entertaining too mean an idea of his first profession</p>
<p>(that of a writer), though it was to this he owed his fame and</p>
<p>fortune.  He spoke of his works as of trifles that were beneath him;</p>
<p>and hinted to me, in our first conversation, that I should visit him</p>
<p>upon no other footing than that of a gentleman who led a life of</p>
<p>plainness and simplicity.  I answered, that had he been so</p>
<p>unfortunate as to be a mere gentleman, I should never have come to</p>
<p>see him; and I was very much disgusted at so unseasonable a piece of</p>
<p>vanity.</p>
<p>Mr. Congreve&#x27;s comedies are the most witty and regular, those of Sir</p>
<p>John Vanbrugh most gay and humorous, and those of Mr. Wycherley have</p>
<p>the greatest force and spirit.  It may be proper to observe that</p>
<p>these fine geniuses never spoke disadvantageously of Moliere; and</p>
<p>that none but the contemptible writers among the English have</p>
<p>endeavoured to lessen the character of that great comic poet.  Such</p>
<p>Italian musicians as despise Lully are themselves persons of no</p>
<p>character or ability; but a Buononcini esteems that great artist,</p>
<p>and does justice to his merit.</p>
<p>The English have some other good comic writers living, such as Sir</p>
<p>Richard Steele and Mr. Cibber, who is an excellent player, and also</p>
<p>Poet Laureate--a title which, how ridiculous soever it may be</p>
<p>thought, is yet worth a thousand crowns a year (besides some</p>
<p>considerable privileges) to the person who enjoys it.  Our</p>
<p>illustrious Corneille had not so much.</p>
<p>To conclude.  Don&#x27;t desire me to descend to particulars with regard</p>
<p>to these English comedies, which I am so fond of applauding; nor to</p>
<p>give you a single smart saying or humorous stroke from Wycherley or</p>
<p>Congreve.  We don&#x27;t laugh in rending a translation.  If you have a</p>
<p>mind to understand the English comedy, the only way to do this will</p>
<p>be for you to go to England, to spend three years in London, to make</p>
<p>yourself master of the English tongue, and to frequent the playhouse</p>
<p>every night.  I receive but little pleasure from the perusal of</p>
<p>Aristophanes and Plautus, and for this reason, because I am neither</p>
<p>a Greek nor a Roman.  The delicacy of the humour, the allusion, the</p>
<p>a propos--all these are lost to a foreigner.</p>
<p>But it is different with respect to tragedy, this treating only of</p>
<p>exalted passions and heroical follies, which the antiquated errors</p>
<p>of fable or history have made sacred.  OEdipus, Electra, and such-</p>
<p>like characters, may with as much propriety be treated of by the</p>
<p>Spaniards, the English, or us, as by the Greeks.  But true comedy is</p>
<p>the speaking picture of the follies and ridiculous foibles of a</p>
<p>nation; so that he only is able to judge of the painting who is</p>
<p>perfectly acquainted with the people it represents.</p>
<p>LETTER XX.--ON SUCH OF THE NOBILITY AS CULTIVATE THE BELLES LETTRES</p>
<p>There once was a time in France when the polite arts were cultivated</p>
<p>by persons of the highest rank in the state.  The courtiers</p>
<p>particularly were conversant in them, although indolence, a taste</p>
<p>for trifles, and a passion for intrigue, were the divinities of the</p>
<p>country.  The Court methinks at this time seems to have given into a</p>
<p>taste quite opposite to that of polite literature, but perhaps the</p>
<p>mode of thinking may be revived in a little time.  The French are of</p>
<p>so flexible a disposition, may be moulded into such a variety of</p>
<p>shapes, that the monarch needs but command and he is immediately</p>
<p>obeyed.  The English generally think, and learning is had in greater</p>
<p>honour among them than in our country--an advantage that results</p>
<p>naturally from the form of their government.  There are about eight</p>
<p>hundred persons in England who have a right to speak in public, and</p>
<p>to support the interest of the kingdom; and near five or six</p>
<p>thousand may in their turns aspire to the same honour.  The whole</p>
<p>nation set themselves up as judges over these, and every man has the</p>
<p>liberty of publishing his thoughts with regard to public affairs,</p>
<p>which shows that all the people in general are indispensably obliged</p>
<p>to cultivate their understandings.  In England the governments of</p>
<p>Greece and Rome are the subject of every conversation, so that every</p>
<p>man is under a necessity of perusing such authors as treat of them,</p>
<p>how disagreeable soever it may be to him; and this study leads</p>
<p>naturally to that of polite literature.  Mankind in general speak</p>
<p>well in their respective professions.  What is the reason why our</p>
<p>magistrates, our lawyers, our physicians, and a great number of the</p>
<p>clergy, are abler scholars, have a finer taste, and more wit, than</p>
<p>persons of all other professions?  The reason is, because their</p>
<p>condition of life requires a cultivated and enlightened mind, in the</p>
<p>same manner as a merchant is obliged to be acquainted with his</p>
<p>traffic.  Not long since an English nobleman, who was very young,</p>
<p>came to see me at Paris on his return from Italy.  He had written a</p>
<p>poetical description of that country, which, for delicacy and</p>
<p>politeness, may vie with anything we meet with in the Earl of</p>
<p>Rochester, or in our Chaulieu, our Sarrasin, or Chapelle.  The</p>
<p>translation I have given of it is so inexpressive of the strength</p>
<p>and delicate humour of the original, that I am obliged seriously to</p>
<p>ask pardon of the author and of all who understand English.</p>
<p>However, as this is the only method I have to make his lordship&#x27;s</p>
<p>verses known, I shall here present you with them in our tongue:-</p>
<p>&quot;Qu&#x27;ay je donc vu dans l&#x27;Italie?</p>
<p>Orgueil, astuce, et pauvrete,</p>
<p>Grands complimens, peu de bonte</p>
<p>Et beaucoup de ceremonie.</p>
<p>&quot;L&#x27;extravagante comedie</p>
<p>Que souvent l&#x27;Inquisition</p>
<p>Vent qu&#x27;on nomme religion</p>
<p>Mais qu&#x27;ici nous nommons folie.</p>
<p>&quot;La Nature en vain bienfaisante</p>
<p>Vent enricher ses lieux charmans,</p>
<p>Des pretres la main desolante</p>
<p>Etouffe ses plus beaux presens.</p>
<p>&quot;Les monsignors, soy disant Grands,</p>
<p>Seuls dans leurs palais magnifiques</p>
<p>Y sont d&#x27;illustres faineants,</p>
<p>Sans argent, et sans domestiques.</p>
<p>&quot;Pour les petits, sans liberte,</p>
<p>Martyrs du joug qui les domine,</p>
<p>Ils ont fait voeu de pauvrete,</p>
<p>Priant Dieu par oisivete</p>
<p>Et toujours jeunant par famine.</p>
<p>&quot;Ces beaux lieux du Pape benis</p>
<p>Semblent habitez par les diables;</p>
<p>Et les habitans miserables</p>
<p>Sont damnes dans le Paradis.&quot;</p>
<p>LETTER XXI.--ON THE EARL OF ROCHESTER AND MR. WALLER</p>
<p>The Earl of Rochester&#x27;s name is universally known.  Mr. de St.</p>
<p>Evremont has made very frequent mention of him, but then he has</p>
<p>represented this famous nobleman in no other light than as the man</p>
<p>of pleasure, as one who was the idol of the fair; but, with regard</p>
<p>to myself, I would willingly describe in him the man of genius, the</p>
<p>great poet.  Among other pieces which display the shining</p>
<p>imagination, his lordship only could boast he wrote some satires on</p>
<p>the same subjects as those our celebrated Boileau made choice of.  I</p>
<p>do not know any better method of improving the taste than to compare</p>
<p>the productions of such great geniuses as have exercised their</p>
<p>talent on the same subject.  Boileau declaims as follows against</p>
<p>human reason in his &quot;Satire on Man:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cependant a le voir plein de vapeurs legeres,</p>
<p>Soi-meme se bercer de ses propres chimeres,</p>
<p>Lui seul de la nature est la baze et l&#x27;appui,</p>
<p>Et le dixieme ciel ne tourne que pour lui.</p>
<p>De tous les animaux il est ici le maitre;</p>
<p>Qui pourroit le nier, poursuis tu?  Moi peut-etre.</p>
<p>Ce maitre pretendu qui leur donne des loix,</p>
<p>Ce roi des animaux, combien a-t&#x27;il de rois?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet, pleased with idle whimsies of his brain,</p>
<p>And puffed with pride, this haughty thing would fain</p>
<p>Be think himself the only stay and prop</p>
<p>That holds the mighty frame of Nature up.</p>
<p>The skies and stars his properties must seem,</p>
<hr>
<p>Of all the creatures he&#x27;s the lord, he cries.</p>
<hr>
<p>And who is there, say you, that dares deny</p>
<p>So owned a truth?  That may be, sir, do I.</p>
<hr>
<p>This boasted monarch of the world who awes</p>
<p>The creatures here, and with his nod gives laws</p>
<p>This self-named king, who thus pretends to be</p>
<p>The lord of all, how many lords has he?&quot;</p>
<p>OLDHAM, a little altered.</p>
<p>The Lord Rochester expresses himself, in his &quot;Satire against Man,&quot;</p>
<p>in pretty near the following manner.  But I must first desire you</p>
<p>always to remember that the versions I give you from the English</p>
<p>poets are written with freedom and latitude, and that the restraint</p>
<p>of our versification, and the delicacies of the French tongue, will</p>
<p>not allow a translator to convey into it the licentious impetuosity</p>
<p>and fire of the English numbers:-</p>
<p>&quot;Cet esprit que je hais, cet esprit plein d&#x27;erreur,</p>
<p>Ce n&#x27;est pas ma raison, c&#x27;est la tienne, docteur.</p>
<p>C&#x27;est la raison frivole, inquiete, orgueilleuse</p>
<p>Des sages animaux, rivale dedaigneuse,</p>
<p>Qui croit entr&#x27;eux et l&#x27;Ange, occuper le milieu,</p>
<p>Et pense etre ici bas l&#x27;image de son Dieu.</p>
<p>Vil atome imparfait, qui croit, doute, dispute</p>
<p>Rampe, s&#x27;eleve, tombe, et nie encore sa chute,</p>
<p>Qui nous dit je suis libre, en nous montrant ses fers,</p>
<p>Et dont l&#x27;oeil trouble et faux, croit percer l&#x27;univers.</p>
<p>Allez, reverends fous, bienheureux fanatiques,</p>
<p>Compilez bien l&#x27;amas de vos riens scholastiques,</p>
<p>Peres de visions, et d&#x27;enigmes sacres,</p>
<p>Auteurs du labirinthe, ou vous vous egarez.</p>
<p>Allez obscurement eclaircir vos misteres,</p>
<p>Et courez dans l&#x27;ecole adorer vos chimeres.</p>
<p>Il est d&#x27;autres erreurs, il est de ces devots</p>
<p>Condamne par eux memes a l&#x27;ennui du repos.</p>
<p>Ce mystique encloitre, fier de son indolence</p>
<p>Tranquille, au sein de Dieu.  Que peut il faire?  Il pense.</p>
<p>Non, tu ne penses point, miserable, tu dors:</p>
<p>Inutile a la terre, et mis au rang des morts.</p>
<p>Ton esprit enerve croupit dans la molesse.</p>
<p>Reveille toi, sois homme, et sors de ton ivresse.</p>
<p>L&#x27;homme est ne pour agir, et tu pretens penser?&quot;  &amp;c.</p>
<p>The original runs thus:-</p>
<p>&quot;Hold mighty man, I cry all this we know,</p>
<p>And &#x27;tis this very reason I despise,</p>
<p>This supernatural gift that makes a mite</p>
<p>Think he&#x27;s the image of the Infinite;</p>
<p>Comparing his short life, void of all rest,</p>
<p>To the eternal and the ever blest.</p>
<p>This busy, puzzling stirrer up of doubt,</p>
<p>That frames deep mysteries, then finds them out,</p>
<p>Filling, with frantic crowds of thinking fools,</p>
<p>Those reverend bedlams, colleges, and schools;</p>
<p>Borne on whose wings each heavy sot can pierce</p>
<p>The limits of the boundless universe.</p>
<p>So charming ointments make an old witch fly,</p>
<p>And bear a crippled carcase through the sky.</p>
<p>&#x27;Tis this exalted power, whose business lies</p>
<p>In nonsense and impossibilities.</p>
<p>This made a whimsical philosopher</p>
<p>Before the spacious world his tub prefer;</p>
<p>And we have modern cloistered coxcombs, who</p>
<p>Retire to think, &#x27;cause they have naught to do.</p>
<p>But thoughts are given for action&#x27;s government,</p>
<p>Where action ceases, thought&#x27;s impertinent.&quot;</p>
<p>Whether these ideas are true or false, it is certain they are</p>
<p>expressed with an energy and fire which form the poet.  I shall be</p>
<p>very far from attempting to examine philosophically into these</p>
<p>verses, to lay down the pencil, and take up the rule and compass on</p>
<p>this occasion; my only design in this letter being to display the</p>
<p>genius of the English poets, and therefore I shall continue in the</p>
<p>same view.</p>
<p>The celebrated Mr. Waller has been very much talked of in France,</p>
<p>and Mr. De la Fontaine, St. Evremont, and Bayle have written his</p>
<p>eulogium, but still his name only is known.  He had much the same</p>
<p>reputation in London as Voiture had in Paris, and in my opinion</p>
<p>deserved it better.  Voiture was born in an age that was just</p>
<p>emerging from barbarity; an age that was still rude and ignorant,</p>
<p>the people of which aimed at wit, though they had not the least</p>
<p>pretensions to it, and sought for points and conceits instead of</p>
<p>sentiments.  Bristol stones are more easily found than diamonds.</p>
<p>Voiture, born with an easy and frivolous, genius, was the first who</p>
<p>shone in this aurora of French literature.  Had he come into the</p>
<p>world after those great geniuses who spread such a glory over the</p>
<p>age of Louis XIV., he would either have been unknown, would have</p>
<p>been despised, or would have corrected his style.  Boileau applauded</p>
<p>him, but it was in his first satires, at a time when the taste of</p>
<p>that great poet was not yet formed.  He was young, and in an age</p>
<p>when persons form a judgment of men from their reputation, and not</p>
<p>from their writings.  Besides, Boileau was very partial both in his</p>
<p>encomiums and his censures.  He applauded Segrais, whose works</p>
<p>nobody reads; he abused Quinault, whose poetical pieces every one</p>
<p>has got by heart; and is wholly silent upon La Fontaine.  Waller,</p>
<p>though a better poet than Voiture, was not yet a finished poet.  The</p>
<p>graces breathe in such of Waller&#x27;s works as are writ in a tender</p>
<p>strain; but then they are languid through negligence, and often</p>
<p>disfigured with false thoughts.  The English had not in his time</p>
<p>attained the art of correct writing.  But his serious compositions</p>
<p>exhibit a strength and vigour which could not have been expected</p>
<p>from the softness and effeminacy of his other pieces.  He wrote an</p>
<p>elegy on Oliver Cromwell, which, with all its faults, is</p>
<p>nevertheless looked upon as a masterpiece.  To understand this copy</p>
<p>of verses you are to know that the day Oliver died was remarkable</p>
<p>for a great storm.  His poem begins in this manner:-</p>
<p>&quot;Il n&#x27;est plus, s&#x27;en est fait, soumettons nous au sort,</p>
<p>Le ciel a signale ce jour par des tempetes,</p>
<p>Et la voix des tonnerres eclatant sur nos tetes</p>
<p>Vient d&#x27;annoncer sa mort.</p>
<p>&quot;Par ses derniers soupirs il ebranle cet ile;</p>
<p>Cet ile que son bras fit trembler tant de fois,</p>
<p>Quand dans le cours de ses exploits,</p>
<p>Il brisoit la tete des Rois,</p>
<p>Et soumettoit un peuple a son joug seul docile.</p>
<p>&quot;Mer tu t&#x27;en es trouble; O mer tes flots emus</p>
<p>Semblent dire en grondant aux plus lointains rivages</p>
<p>Que l&#x27;effroi de la terre et ton maitre n&#x27;est plus.</p>
<p>&quot;Tel au ciel autrefois s&#x27;envola Romulus,</p>
<p>Tel il quitta la Terre, au milieu des orages,</p>
<p>Tel d&#x27;un peuple guerrier il recut les homages;</p>
<p>Obei dans sa vie, sa mort adore,</p>
<p>Son palais fut un Temple,&quot; &amp;c.</p>
<p>&quot;We must resign! heaven his great soul does claim</p>
<p>In storms as loud as his immortal fame;</p>
<p>His dying groans, his last breath shakes our isle,</p>
<p>And trees uncut fall for his funeral pile:</p>
<p>About his palace their broad roots are tost</p>
<p>Into the air; so Romulus was lost!</p>
<p>New Rome in such a tempest missed her king,</p>
<p>And from obeying fell to worshipping.</p>
<p>On OEta&#x27;s top thus Hercules lay dead,</p>
<p>With ruined oaks and pines about him spread.</p>
<p>Nature herself took notice of his death,</p>
<p>And, sighing, swelled the sea with such a breath,</p>
<p>That to remotest shores the billows rolled,</p>
<p>Th&#x27; approaching fate of his great ruler told.&quot;</p>
<p>WALLER.</p>
<p>It was this elogium that gave occasion to the reply (taken notice of</p>
<p>in Bayle&#x27;s Dictionary), which Waller made to King Charles II.  This</p>
<p>king, to whom Waller had a little before (as is usual with bards and</p>
<p>monarchs) presented a copy of verses embroidered with praises,</p>
<p>reproached the poet for not writing with so much energy and fire as</p>
<p>when he had applauded the Usurper (meaning Oliver).  &quot;Sir,&quot; replied</p>
<p>Waller to the king, &quot;we poets succeed better in fiction than in</p>
<p>truth.&quot;  This answer was not so sincere as that which a Dutch</p>
<p>ambassador made, who, when the same monarch complained that his</p>
<p>masters paid less regard to him than they had done to Cromwell.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, sir!&quot; says the Ambassador, &quot;Oliver was quite another man--&quot;  It</p>
<p>is not my intent to give a commentary on Waller&#x27;s character, nor on</p>
<p>that of any other person; for I consider men after their death in no</p>
<p>other light than as they were writers, and wholly disregard</p>
<p>everything else.  I shall only observe that Waller, though born in a</p>
<p>court, and to an estate of five or six thousand pounds sterling a</p>
<p>year, was never so proud or so indolent as to lay aside the happy</p>
<p>talent which Nature had indulged him.  The Earls of Dorset and</p>
<p>Roscommon, the two Dukes of Buckingham, the Lord Halifax, and so</p>
<p>many other noblemen, did not think the reputation they obtained of</p>
<p>very great poets and illustrious writers, any way derogatory to</p>
<p>their quality.  They are more glorious for their works than for</p>
<p>their titles.  These cultivated the polite arts with as much</p>
<p>assiduity as though they had been their whole dependence.</p>
<p>They also have made learning appear venerable in the eyes of the</p>
<p>vulgar, who have need to be led in all things by the great; and who,</p>
<p>nevertheless, fashion their manners less after those of the nobility</p>
<p>(in England I mean) than in any other country in the world.</p>
<p>LETTER XXII.--ON MR. POPE AND SOME OTHER FAMOUS POETS</p>
<p>I intended to treat of Mr. Prior, one of the most amiable English</p>
<p>poets, whom you saw Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary at Paris</p>
<p>in 1712.  I also designed to have given you some idea of the Lord</p>
<p>Roscommon&#x27;s and the Lord Dorset&#x27;s muse; but I find that to do this I</p>
<p>should be obliged to write a large volume, and that, after much</p>
<p>pains and trouble, you would have but an imperfect idea of all those</p>
<p>works.  Poetry is a kind of music in which a man should have some</p>
<p>knowledge before he pretends to judge of it.  When I give you a</p>
<p>translation of some passages from those foreign poets, I only prick</p>
<p>down, and that imperfectly, their music; but then I cannot express</p>
<p>the taste of their harmony.</p>
<p>There is one English poem especially which I should despair of ever</p>
<p>making you understand, the title whereof is &quot;Hudibras.&quot;  The subject</p>
<p>of it is the Civil War in the time of the grand rebellion, and the</p>
<p>principles and practice of the Puritans are therein ridiculed.  It</p>
<p>is Don Quixote, it is our &quot;Satire Menippee&quot; blended together.  I</p>
<p>never found so much wit in one single book as in that, which at the</p>
<p>same time is the most difficult to be translated.  Who would believe</p>
<p>that a work which paints in such lively and natural colours the</p>
<p>several foibles and follies of mankind, and where we meet with more</p>
<p>sentiments than words, should baffle the endeavours of the ablest</p>
<p>translator?  But the reason of this is, almost every part of it</p>
<p>alludes to particular incidents.  The clergy are there made the</p>
<p>principal object of ridicule, which is understood but by few among</p>
<p>the laity.  To explain this a commentary would be requisite, and</p>
<p>humour when explained is no longer humour.  Whoever sets up for a</p>
<p>commentator of smart sayings and repartees is himself a blockhead.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the works of the ingenious Dean Swift, who</p>
<p>has been called the English Rabelais, will never be well understood</p>
<p>in France.  This gentleman has the honour (in common with Rabelais)</p>
<p>of being a priest, and, like him, laughs at everything; but, in my</p>
<p>humble opinion, the title of the English Rabelais which is given the</p>
<p>dean is highly derogatory to his genius.  The former has</p>
<p>interspersed his unaccountably-fantastic and unintelligible book</p>
<p>with the most gay strokes of humour; but which, at the same time,</p>
<p>has a greater proportion of impertinence.  He has been vastly lavish</p>
<p>of erudition, of smut, and insipid raillery.  An agreeable tale of</p>
<p>two pages is purchased at the expense of whole volumes of nonsense.</p>
<p>There are but few persons, and those of a grotesque taste, who</p>
<p>pretend to understand and to esteem this work; for, as to the rest</p>
<p>of the nation, they laugh at the pleasant and diverting touches</p>
<p>which are found in Rabelais and despise his book.  He is looked upon</p>
<p>as the prince of buffoons.  The readers are vexed to think that a</p>
<p>man who was master of so much wit should have made so wretched a use</p>
<p>of it; he is an intoxicated philosopher who never wrote but when he</p>
<p>was in liquor.</p>
<p>Dean Swift is Rabelais in his senses, and frequenting the politest</p>
<p>company.  The former, indeed, is not so gay as the latter, but then</p>
<p>he possesses all the delicacy, the justness, the choice, the good</p>
<p>taste, in all which particulars our giggling rural Vicar Rabelais is</p>
<p>wanting.  The poetical numbers of Dean Swift are of a singular and</p>
<p>almost inimitable taste; true humour, whether in prose or verse,</p>
<p>seems to be his peculiar talent; but whoever is desirous of</p>
<p>understanding him perfectly must visit the island in which he was</p>
<p>born.</p>
<p>It will be much easier for you to form an idea of Mr. Pope&#x27;s works.</p>
<p>He is, in my opinion, the most elegant, the most correct poet; and,</p>
<p>at the same time, the most harmonious (a circumstance which redounds</p>
<p>very much to the honour of this muse) that England ever gave birth</p>
<p>to.  He has mellowed the harsh sounds of the English trumpet to the</p>
<p>soft accents of the flute.  His compositions may be easily</p>
<p>translated, because they are vastly clear and perspicuous; besides,</p>
<p>most of his subjects are general, and relative to all nations.</p>
<p>His &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot; will soon be known in France by the</p>
<p>translation which l&#x27;Abbe de Resnel has made of it.</p>
<p>Here is an extract from his poem entitled the &quot;Rape of the Lock,&quot;</p>
<p>which I just now translated with the latitude I usually take on</p>
<p>these occasions; for, once again, nothing can be more ridiculous</p>
<p>than to translate a poet literally:-</p>
<p>&quot;Umbriel, a l&#x27;instant, vieil gnome rechigne,</p>
<p>Va d&#x27;une aile pesante et d&#x27;un air renfrogne</p>
<p>Chercher en murmurant la caverne profonde,</p>
<p>Ou loin des doux raions que repand l&#x27;oeil du monde</p>
<p>La Deesse aux Vapeurs a choisi son sejour,</p>
<p>Les Tristes Aquilons y sifflent a l&#x27;entour,</p>
<p>Et le souffle mal sain de leur aride haleine</p>
<p>Y porte aux environs la fievre et la migraine.</p>
<p>Sur un riche sofa derriere un paravent</p>
<p>Loin des flambeaux, du bruit, des parleurs et du vent,</p>
<p>La quinteuse deesse incessamment repose,</p>
<p>Le coeur gros de chagrin, sans en savoir la cause.</p>
<p>N&#x27;aiant pense jamais, l&#x27;esprit toujours trouble,</p>
<p>L&#x27;oeil charge, le teint pale, et l&#x27;hypocondre enfle.</p>
<p>La medisante Envie, est assise aupres d&#x27;elle,</p>
<p>Vieil spectre feminin, decrepite pucelle,</p>
<p>Avec un air devot dechirant son prochain,</p>
<p>Et chansonnant les Gens l&#x27;Evangile a la main.</p>
<p>Sur un lit plein de fleurs negligemment panchee</p>
<p>Une jeune beaute non loin d&#x27;elle est couchee,</p>
<p>C&#x27;est l&#x27;Affectation qui grassaie en parlant,</p>
<p>Ecoute sans entendre, et lorgne en regardant.</p>
<p>Qui rougit sans pudeur, et rit de tout sans joie,</p>
<p>De cent maux differens pretend qu&#x27;elle est la proie;</p>
<p>Et pleine de sante sous le rouge et le fard,</p>
<p>Se plaint avec molesse, et se pame avec art.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite</p>
<p>As ever sullied the fair face of light,</p>
<p>Down to the central earth, his proper scene,</p>
<p>Repairs to search the gloomy cave of Spleen.</p>
<p>Swift on his sooty pinions flits the gnome,</p>
<p>And in a vapour reached the dismal dome.</p>
<p>No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,</p>
<p>The dreaded east is all the wind that blows.</p>
<p>Here, in a grotto, sheltered close from air,</p>
<p>And screened in shades from day&#x27;s detested glare,</p>
<p>She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,</p>
<p>Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head,</p>
<p>Two handmaids wait the throne.  Alike in place,</p>
<p>But differing far in figure and in face,</p>
<p>Here stood Ill-nature, like an ancient maid,</p>
<p>Her wrinkled form in black and white arrayed;</p>
<p>With store of prayers for mornings, nights, and noons,</p>
<p>Her hand is filled; her bosom with lampoons.</p>
<p>There Affectation, with a sickly mien,</p>
<p>Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen,</p>
<p>Practised to lisp, and hang the head aside,</p>
<p>Faints into airs, and languishes with pride;</p>
<p>On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,</p>
<p>Wrapt in a gown, for sickness and for show.&quot;</p>
<p>This extract, in the original (not in the faint translation I have</p>
<p>given you of it), may be compared to the description of la Molesse</p>
<p>(softness or effeminacy), in Boileau&#x27;s &quot;Lutrin.&quot;</p>
<p>Methinks I now have given you specimens enough from the English</p>
<p>poets.  I have made some transient mention of their philosophers,</p>
<p>but as for good historians among them, I don&#x27;t know of any; and,</p>
<p>indeed, a Frenchman was forced to write their history.  Possibly the</p>
<p>English genius, which is either languid or impetuous, has not yet</p>
<p>acquired that unaffected eloquence, that plain but majestic air</p>
<p>which history requires.  Possibly too, the spirit of party which</p>
<p>exhibits objects in a dim and confused light may have sunk the</p>
<p>credit of their historians.  One half of the nation is always at</p>
<p>variance with the other half.  I have met with people who assured me</p>
<p>that the Duke of Marlborough was a coward, and that Mr. Pope was a</p>
<p>fool; just as some Jesuits in France declare Pascal to have been a</p>
<p>man of little or no genius, and some Jansenists affirm Father</p>
<p>Bourdaloue to have been a mere babbler.  The Jacobites consider Mary</p>
<p>Queen of Scots as a pious heroine, but those of an opposite party</p>
<p>look upon her as a prostitute, an adulteress, a murderer.  Thus the</p>
<p>English have memorials of the several reigns, but no such thing as a</p>
<p>history.  There is, indeed, now living, one Mr. Gordon (the public</p>
<p>are obliged to him for a translation of Tacitus), who is very</p>
<p>capable of writing the history of his own country, but Rapin de</p>
<p>Thoyras got the start of him.  To conclude, in my opinion the</p>
<p>English have not such good historians as the French have no such</p>
<p>thing as a real tragedy, have several delightful comedies, some</p>
<p>wonderful passages in certain of their poems, and boast of</p>
<p>philosophers that are worthy of instructing mankind.  The English</p>
<p>have reaped very great benefit from the writers of our nation, and</p>
<p>therefore we ought (since they have not scrupled to be in our debt)</p>
<p>to borrow from them.  Both the English and we came after the</p>
<p>Italians, who have been our instructors in all the arts, and whom we</p>
<p>have surpassed in some.  I cannot determine which of the three</p>
<p>nations ought to be honoured with the palm; but happy the writer who</p>
<p>could display their various merits.</p>
<p>LETTER XXIII.--ON THE REGARD THAT OUGHT TO BE SHOWN TO MEN OF</p>
<p>LETTERS</p>
<p>Neither the English nor any other people have foundations</p>
<p>established in favour of the polite arts like those in France.</p>
<p>There are Universities in most countries, but it is in France only</p>
<p>that we meet with so beneficial an encouragement for astronomy and</p>
<p>all parts of the mathematics, for physic, for researches into</p>
<p>antiquity, for painting, sculpture, and architecture.  Louis XIV.</p>
<p>has immortalised his name by these several foundations, and this</p>
<p>immortality did not cost him two hundred thousand livres a year.</p>
<p>I must confess that one of the things I very much wonder at is, that</p>
<p>as the Parliament of Great Britain have promised a reward of 20,000</p>
<p>pounds sterling to any person who may discover the longitude, they</p>
<p>should never have once thought to imitate Louis XIV. in his</p>
<p>munificence with regard to the arts and sciences.</p>
<p>Merit, indeed, meets in England with rewards of another kind, which</p>
<p>redound more to the honour of the nation.  The English have so great</p>
<p>a veneration for exalted talents, that a man of merit in their</p>
<p>country is always sure of making his fortune.  Mr. Addison in France</p>
<p>would have been elected a member of one of the academies, and, by</p>
<p>the credit of some women, might have obtained a yearly pension of</p>
<p>twelve hundred livres, or else might have been imprisoned in the</p>
<p>Bastile, upon pretence that certain strokes in his tragedy of Cato</p>
<p>had been discovered which glanced at the porter of some man in</p>
<p>power.  Mr. Addison was raised to the post of Secretary of State in</p>
<p>England.  Sir Isaac Newton was made Master of the Royal Mint.  Mr.</p>
<p>Congreve had a considerable employment.  Mr. Prior was</p>
<p>Plenipotentiary.  Dr. Swift is Dean of St. Patrick in Dublin, and is</p>
<p>more revered in Ireland than the Primate himself.  The religion</p>
<p>which Mr. Pope professes excludes him, indeed, from preferments of</p>
<p>every kind, but then it did not prevent his gaining two hundred</p>
<p>thousand livres by his excellent translation of Homer.  I myself saw</p>
<p>a long time in France the author of Rhadamistus ready to perish for</p>
<p>hunger.  And the son of one of the greatest men our country ever</p>
<p>gave birth to, and who was beginning to run the noble career which</p>
<p>his father had set him, would have been reduced to the extremes of</p>
<p>misery had he not been patronised by Monsieur Fagon.</p>
<p>But the circumstance which mostly encourages the arts in England is</p>
<p>the great veneration which is paid them.  The picture of the Prime</p>
<p>Minister hangs over the chimney of his own closet, but I have seen</p>
<p>that of Mr. Pope in twenty noblemen&#x27;s houses.  Sir Isaac Newton was</p>
<p>revered in his lifetime, and had a due respect paid to him after his</p>
<p>death; the greatest men in the nation disputing who should have the</p>
<p>honour of holding up his pall.  Go into Westminster Abbey, and you</p>
<p>will find that what raises the admiration of the spectator is not</p>
<p>the mausoleums of the English kings, but the monuments which the</p>
<p>gratitude of the nation has erected to perpetuate the memory of</p>
<p>those illustrious men who contributed to its glory.  We view their</p>
<p>statues in that abbey in the same manner as those of Sophocles,</p>
<p>Plato, and other immortal personages were viewed in Athens; and I am</p>
<p>persuaded that the bare sight of those glorious monuments has fired</p>
<p>more than one breast, and been the occasion of their becoming great</p>
<p>men.</p>
<p>The English have even been reproached with paying too extravagant</p>
<p>honours to mere merit, and censured for interring the celebrated</p>
<p>actress Mrs. Oldfield in Westminster Abbey, with almost the same</p>
<p>pomp as Sir Isaac Newton.  Some pretend that the English had paid</p>
<p>her these great funeral honours, purposely to make us more strongly</p>
<p>sensible of the barbarity and injustice which they object to us, for</p>
<p>having buried Mademoiselle Le Couvreur ignominiously in the fields.</p>
<p>But be assured from me, that the English were prompted by no other</p>
<p>principle in burying Mrs. Oldfield in Westminster Abbey than their</p>
<p>good sense.  They are far from being so ridiculous as to brand with</p>
<p>infamy an art which has immortalised a Euripides and a Sophocles; or</p>
<p>to exclude from the body of their citizens a set of people whose</p>
<p>business is to set off with the utmost grace of speech and action</p>
<p>those pieces which the nation is proud of.</p>
<p>Under the reign of Charles I. and in the beginning of the civil wars</p>
<p>raised by a number of rigid fanatics, who at last were the victims</p>
<p>to it; a great many pieces were published against theatrical and</p>
<p>other shows, which were attacked with the greater virulence because</p>
<p>that monarch and his queen, daughter to Henry I. of France, were</p>
<p>passionately fond of them.</p>
<p>One Mr. Prynne, a man of most furiously scrupulous principles, who</p>
<p>would have thought himself damned had he worn a cassock instead of a</p>
<p>short cloak, and have been glad to see one-half of mankind cut the</p>
<p>other to pieces for the glory of God, and the Propaganda Fide; took</p>
<p>it into his head to write a most wretched satire against some pretty</p>
<p>good comedies, which were exhibited very innocently every night</p>
<p>before their majesties.  He quoted the authority of the Rabbis, and</p>
<p>some passages from St. Bonaventure, to prove that the OEdipus of</p>
<p>Sophocles was the work of the evil spirit; that Terence was</p>
<p>excommunicated ipso facto; and added, that doubtless Brutus, who was</p>
<p>a very severe Jansenist, assassinated Julius Caesar for no other</p>
<p>reason but because he, who was Pontifex Maximus, presumed to write a</p>
<p>tragedy the subject of which was OEdipus.  Lastly, he declared that</p>
<p>all who frequented the theatre were excommunicated, as they thereby</p>
<p>renounced their baptism.  This was casting the highest insult on the</p>
<p>king and all the royal family; and as the English loved their prince</p>
<p>at that time, they could not bear to hear a writer talk of</p>
<p>excommunicating him, though they themselves afterwards cut his head</p>
<p>off.  Prynne was summoned to appear before the Star Chamber; his</p>
<p>wonderful book, from which Father Le Brun stole his, was sentenced</p>
<p>to be burnt by the common hangman, and himself to lose his ears.</p>
<p>His trial is now extant.</p>
<p>The Italians are far from attempting to cast a blemish on the opera,</p>
<p>or to excommunicate Signor Senesino or Signora Cuzzoni.  With regard</p>
<p>to myself, I could presume to wish that the magistrates would</p>
<p>suppress I know not what contemptible pieces written against the</p>
<p>stage.  For when the English and Italians hear that we brand with</p>
<p>the greatest mark of infamy an art in which we excel; that we</p>
<p>excommunicate persons who receive salaries from the king; that we</p>
<p>condemn as impious a spectacle exhibited in convents and</p>
<p>monasteries; that we dishonour sports in which Louis XIV. and Louis</p>
<p>XV., performed as actors; that we give the title of the devil&#x27;s</p>
<p>works to pieces which are received by magistrates of the most severe</p>
<p>character, and represented before a virtuous queen; when, I say,</p>
<p>foreigners are told of this insolent conduct, this contempt for the</p>
<p>royal authority, and this Gothic rusticity which some presume to</p>
<p>call Christian severity, what an idea must they entertain of our</p>
<p>nation?  And how will it be possible for them to conceive, either</p>
<p>that our laws give a sanction to an art which is declared infamous,</p>
<p>or that some persons dare to stamp with infamy an art which receives</p>
<p>a sanction from the laws, is rewarded by kings, cultivated and</p>
<p>encouraged by the greatest men, and admired by whole nations?  And</p>
<p>that Father Le Brun&#x27;s impertinent libel against the stage is seen in</p>
<p>a bookseller&#x27;s shop, standing the very next to the immortal labours</p>
<p>of Racine, of Corneille, of Moliere, &amp;c.</p>
<p>LETTER XXIV.--ON THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND OTHER ACADEMIES</p>
<p>The English had an Academy of Sciences many years before us, but</p>
<p>then it is not under such prudent regulations as ours, the only</p>
<p>reason of which very possibly is, because it was founded before the</p>
<p>Academy of Paris; for had it been founded after, it would very</p>
<p>probably have adopted some of the sage laws of the former and</p>
<p>improved upon others.</p>
<p>Two things, and those the most essential to man, are wanting in the</p>
<p>Royal Society of London, I mean rewards and laws.  A seat in the</p>
<p>Academy at Paris is a small but secure fortune to a geometrician or</p>
<p>a chemist; but this is so far from being the case at London, that</p>
<p>the several members of the Royal Society are at a continual, though</p>
<p>indeed small expense.  Any man in England who declares himself a</p>
<p>lover of the mathematics and natural philosophy, and expresses an</p>
<p>inclination to be a member of the Royal Society, is immediately</p>
<p>elected into it.  But in France it is not enough that a man who</p>
<p>aspires to the honour of being a member of the Academy, and of</p>
<p>receiving the royal stipend, has a love for the sciences; he must at</p>
<p>the same time be deeply skilled in them; and is obliged to dispute</p>
<p>the seat with competitors who are so much the more formidable as</p>
<p>they are fired by a principle of glory, by interest, by the</p>
<p>difficulty itself; and by that inflexibility of mind which is</p>
<p>generally found in those who devote themselves to that pertinacious</p>
<p>study, the mathematics.</p>
<p>The Academy of Sciences is prudently confined to the study of</p>
<p>Nature, and, indeed, this is a field spacious enough for fifty or</p>
<p>threescore persons to range in.  That of London mixes</p>
<p>indiscriminately literature with physics; but methinks the founding</p>
<p>an academy merely for the polite arts is more judicious, as it</p>
<p>prevents confusion, and the joining, in some measure, of</p>
<p>heterogeneals, such as a dissertation on the head-dresses of the</p>
<p>Roman ladies with a hundred or more new curves.</p>
<p>As there is very little order and regularity in the Royal Society,</p>
<p>and not the least encouragement; and that the Academy of Paris is on</p>
<p>a quite different foot, it is no wonder that our transactions are</p>
<p>drawn up in a more just and beautiful manner than those of the</p>
<p>English.  Soldiers who are under a regular discipline, and besides</p>
<p>well paid, must necessarily at last perform more glorious</p>
<p>achievements than others who are mere volunteers.  It must indeed be</p>
<p>confessed that the Royal Society boast their Newton, but then he did</p>
<p>not owe his knowledge and discoveries to that body; so far from it,</p>
<p>that the latter were intelligible to very few of his fellow members.</p>
<p>A genius like that of Sir Isaac belonged to all the academies in the</p>
<p>world, because all had a thousand things to learn of him.</p>
<p>The celebrated Dean Swift formed a design, in the latter end of the</p>
<p>late Queen&#x27;s reign, to found an academy for the English tongue upon</p>
<p>the model of that of the French.  This project was promoted by the</p>
<p>late Earl of Oxford, Lord High Treasurer, and much more by the Lord</p>
<p>Bolingbroke, Secretary of State, who had the happy talent of</p>
<p>speaking without premeditation in the Parliament House with as much</p>
<p>purity as Dean Swift wrote in his closet, and who would have been</p>
<p>the ornament and protector of that academy.  Those only would have</p>
<p>been chosen members of it whose works will last as long as the</p>
<p>English tongue, such as Dean Swift, Mr. Prior, whom we saw here</p>
<p>invested with a public character, and whose fame in England is equal</p>
<p>to that of La Fontaine in France; Mr. Pope, the English Boileau, Mr.</p>
<p>Congreve, who may be called their Moliere, and several other eminent</p>
<p>persons whose names I have forgot; all these would have raised the</p>
<p>glory of that body to a great height even in its infancy.  But Queen</p>
<p>Anne being snatched suddenly from the world, the Whigs were resolved</p>
<p>to ruin the protectors of the intended academy, a circumstance that</p>
<p>was of the most fatal consequence to polite literature.  The members</p>
<p>of this academy would have had a very great advantage over those who</p>
<p>first formed that of the French, for Swift, Prior, Congreve, Dryden,</p>
<p>Pope, Addison, &amp;c. had fixed the English tongue by their writings;</p>
<p>whereas Chapelain, Colletet, Cassaigne, Faret, Perrin, Cotin, our</p>
<p>first academicians, were a disgrace to their country; and so much</p>
<p>ridicule is now attached to their very names, that if an author of</p>
<p>some genius in this age had the misfortune to be called Chapelain or</p>
<p>Cotin, he would be under a necessity of changing his name.</p>
<p>One circumstance, to which the English Academy should especially</p>
<p>have attended, is to have prescribed to themselves occupations of a</p>
<p>quite different kind from those with which our academicians amuse</p>
<p>themselves.  A wit of this country asked me for the memoirs of the</p>
<p>French Academy.  I answered, they have no memoirs, but have printed</p>
<p>threescore or fourscore volumes in quarto of compliments.  The</p>
<p>gentleman perused one or two of them, but without being able to</p>
<p>understand the style in which they were written, though he</p>
<p>understood all our good authors perfectly.  &quot;All,&quot; says he, &quot;I see</p>
<p>in these elegant discourses is, that the member elect having assured</p>
<p>the audience that his predecessor was a great man, that Cardinal</p>
<p>Richelieu was a very great man, that the Chancellor Seguier was a</p>
<p>pretty great man, that Louis XIV. was a more than great man, the</p>
<p>director answers in the very same strain, and adds, that the member</p>
<p>elect may also be a sort of great man, and that himself, in quality</p>
<p>of director, must also have some share in this greatness.&quot;</p>
<p>The cause why all these academical discourses have unhappily done so</p>
<p>little honour to this body is evident enough.  Vitium est temporis</p>
<p>potius quam hominis (the fault is owing to the age rather than to</p>
<p>particular persons).  It grew up insensibly into a custom for every</p>
<p>academician to repeat these elogiums at his reception; it was laid</p>
<p>down as a kind of law that the public should be indulged from time</p>
<p>to time the sullen satisfaction of yawning over these productions.</p>
<p>If the reason should afterwards be sought, why the greatest geniuses</p>
<p>who have been incorporated into that body have sometimes made the</p>
<p>worst speeches, I answer, that it is wholly owing to a strong</p>
<p>propension, the gentlemen in question had to shine, and to display a</p>
<p>thread-bare, worn-out subject in a new and uncommon light.  The</p>
<p>necessity of saying something, the perplexity of having nothing to</p>
<p>say, and a desire of being witty, are three circumstances which</p>
<p>alone are capable of making even the greatest writer ridiculous.</p>
<p>These gentlemen, not being able to strike out any new thoughts,</p>
<p>hunted after a new play of words, and delivered themselves without</p>
<p>thinking at all:  in like manner as people who should seem to chew</p>
<p>with great eagerness, and make as though they were eating, at the</p>
<p>same time that they were just starved.</p>
<p>It is a law in the French Academy, to publish all those discourses</p>
<p>by which only they are known, but they should rather make a law</p>
<p>never to print any of them.</p>
<p>But the Academy of the Belles Lettres have a more prudent and more</p>
<p>useful object, which is, to present the public with a collection of</p>
<p>transactions that abound with curious researches and critiques.</p>
<p>These transactions are already esteemed by foreigners; and it were</p>
<p>only to be wished that some subjects in them had been more</p>
<p>thoroughly examined, and that others had not been treated at all.</p>
<p>As, for instance, we should have been very well satisfied, had they</p>
<p>omitted I know not what dissertation on the prerogative of the right</p>
<p>hand over the left; and some others, which, though not published</p>
<p>under so ridiculous a title, are yet written on subjects that are</p>
<p>almost as frivolous and silly.</p>
<p>The Academy of Sciences, in such of their researches as are of a</p>
<p>more difficult kind and a more sensible use, embrace the knowledge</p>
<p>of nature and the improvements of the arts.  We may presume that</p>
<p>such profound, such uninterrupted pursuits as these, such exact</p>
<p>calculations, such refined discoveries, such extensive and exalted</p>
<p>views, will, at last, produce something that may prove of advantage</p>
<p>to the universe.  Hitherto, as we have observed together, the most</p>
<p>useful discoveries have been made in the most barbarous times.  One</p>
<p>would conclude that the business of the most enlightened ages and</p>
<p>the most learned bodies, is, to argue and debate on things which</p>
<p>were invented by ignorant people.  We know exactly the angle which</p>
<p>the sail of a ship is to make with the keel in order to its sailing</p>
<p>better; and yet Columbus discovered America without having the least</p>
<p>idea of the property of this angle:  however, I am far from</p>
<p>inferring from hence that we are to confine ourselves merely to a</p>
<p>blind practice, but happy it were, would naturalists and</p>
<p>geometricians unite, as much as possible, the practice with the</p>
<p>theory.</p>
<p>Strange, but so it is, that those things which reflect the greatest</p>
<p>honour on the human mind are frequently of the least benefit to it!</p>
<p>A man who understands the four fundamental rules of arithmetic,</p>
<p>aided by a little good sense, shall amass prodigious wealth in</p>
<p>trade, shall become a Sir Peter Delme, a Sir Richard Hopkins, a Sir</p>
<p>Gilbert Heathcote, whilst a poor algebraist spends his whole life in</p>
<p>searching for astonishing properties and relations in numbers, which</p>
<p>at the same time are of no manner of use, and will not acquaint him</p>
<p>with the nature of exchanges.  This is very nearly the case with</p>
<p>most of the arts:  there is a certain point beyond which all</p>
<p>researches serve to no other purpose than merely to delight an</p>
<p>inquisitive mind.  Those ingenious and useless truths may be</p>
<p>compared to stars which, by being placed at too great a distance,</p>
<p>cannot afford us the least light.</p>
<p>With regard to the French Academy, how great a service would they do</p>
<p>to literature, to the language, and the nation, if, instead of</p>
<p>publishing a set of compliments annually, they would give us new</p>
<p>editions of the valuable works written in the age of Louis XIV.,</p>
<p>purged from the several errors of diction which are crept into them.</p>
<p>There are many of these errors in Corneille and Moliere, but those</p>
<p>in La Fontaine are very numerous.  Such as could not be corrected</p>
<p>might at least be pointed out.  By this means, as all the Europeans</p>
<p>read those works, they would teach them our language in its utmost</p>
<p>purity--which, by that means, would be fixed to a lasting standard;</p>
<p>and valuable French books being then printed at the King&#x27;s expense,</p>
<p>would prove one of the most glorious monuments the nation could</p>
<p>boast.  I have been told that Boileau formerly made this proposal,</p>
<p>and that it has since been revived by a gentleman eminent for his</p>
<p>genius, his fine sense, and just taste for criticism; but this</p>
<p>thought has met with the fate of many other useful projects, of</p>
<p>being applauded and neglected.</p>
