<p>DEDICATION</p>

<p>Let the brilliant mind that gave me the subject of this Scene</p>
<p>have the honor of it.</p>
<p>Her brother,</p>
<p>De Balzac</p>
<p>A START IN LIFE</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>THAT WHICH WAS LACKING TO PIERROTIN&#x27;S HAPPINESS</p>
<p>Railroads, in a future not far distant, must force certain industries</p>
<p>to disappear forever, and modify several others, more especially those</p>
<p>relating to the different modes of transportation in use around Paris.</p>
<p>Therefore the persons and things which are the elements of this Scene</p>
<p>will soon give to it the character of an archaeological work. Our</p>
<p>nephews ought to be enchanted to learn the social material of an epoch</p>
<p>which they will call the &quot;olden time.&quot; The picturesque &quot;coucous&quot; which</p>
<p>stood on the Place de la Concorde, encumbering the Cours-la-Reine,--</p>
<p>coucous which had flourished for a century, and were still numerous in</p>
<p>1830, scarcely exist in 1842, unless on the occasion of some</p>
<p>attractive suburban solemnity, like that of the Grandes Eaux of</p>
<p>Versailles. In 1820, the various celebrated places called the</p>
<p>&quot;Environs of Paris&quot; did not all possess a regular stage-coach service.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Touchards, father and son, had acquired a monopoly</p>
<p>of travel and transportation to all the populous towns within a</p>
<p>radius of forty-five miles; and their enterprise constituted a fine</p>
<p>establishment in the rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis. In spite of their</p>
<p>long-standing rights, in spite, too, of their efforts, their capital,</p>
<p>and all the advantages of a powerful centralization, the Touchard</p>
<p>coaches (&quot;messageries&quot;) found terrible competition in the coucous for</p>
<p>all points with a circumference of fifteen or twenty miles. The</p>
<p>passion of the Parisian for the country is such that local enterprise</p>
<p>could successfully compete with the Lesser Stage company,--Petites</p>
<p>Messageries, the name given to the Touchard enterprise to distinguish</p>
<p>it from that of the Grandes Messageries of the rue Montmartre. At the</p>
<p>time of which we write, the Touchard success was stimulating</p>
<p>speculators. For every small locality in the neighborhood of Paris</p>
<p>there sprang up schemes of beautiful, rapid, and commodious vehicles,</p>
<p>departing and arriving in Paris at fixed hours, which produced,</p>
<p>naturally, a fierce competition. Beaten on the long distances of</p>
<p>twelve to eighteen miles, the coucou came down to shorter trips, and</p>
<p>so lived on for several years. At last, however, it succumbed to</p>
<p>omnibuses, which demonstrated the possibility of carrying eighteen</p>
<p>persons in a vehicle drawn by two horses. To-day the coucous--if by</p>
<p>chance any of those birds of ponderous flight still linger in the</p>
<p>second-hand carriage-shops--might be made, as to its structure and</p>
<p>arrangement, the subject of learned researches comparable to those of</p>
<p>Cuvier on the animals discovered in the chalk pits of Montmartre.</p>
<p>These petty enterprises, which had struggled since 1822 against the</p>
<p>Touchards, usually found a strong foothold in the good-will and</p>
<p>sympathy of the inhabitants of the districts which they served. The</p>
<p>person undertaking the business as proprietor and conductor was nearly</p>
<p>always an inn-keeper along the route, to whom the beings, things, and</p>
<p>interests with which he had to do were all familiar. He could execute</p>
<p>commissions intelligently; he never asked as much for his little</p>
<p>stages, and therefore obtained more custom than the Touchard coaches.</p>
<p>He managed to elude the necessity of a custom-house permit. If need</p>
<p>were, he was willing to infringe the law as to the number of</p>
<p>passengers he might carry. In short, he possessed the affection of the</p>
<p>masses; and thus it happened that whenever a rival came upon the same</p>
<p>route, if his days for running were not the same as those of the</p>
<p>coucou, travellers would put off their journey to make it with their</p>
<p>long-tried coachman, although his vehicle and his horses might be in a</p>
<p>far from reassuring condition.</p>
<p>One of the lines which the Touchards, father and son, endeavored to</p>
<p>monopolize, and the one most stoutly disputed (as indeed it still is),</p>
<p>is that of Paris to Beaumont-sur-Oise,--a line extremely profitable,</p>
<p>for three rival enterprises worked it in 1822. In vain the Touchards</p>
<p>lowered their price; in vain they constructed better coaches and</p>
<p>started oftener. Competition still continued, so productive is a line</p>
<p>on which are little towns like Saint-Denis and Saint-Brice, and</p>
<p>villages like Pierrefitte, Groslay, Ecouen, Poncelles, Moisselles,</p>
<p>Monsoult, Maffliers, Franconville, Presles, Nointel, Nerville, etc.</p>
<p>The Touchard coaches finally extended their route to Chambly; but</p>
<p>competition followed. To-day the Toulouse, a rival enterprise, goes as</p>
<p>far as Beauvais.</p>
<p>Along this route, which is that toward England, there lies a road</p>
<p>which turns off at a place well-named, in view of its topography, The</p>
<p>Cave, and leads through a most delightful valley in the basin of the</p>
<p>Oise to the little town of Isle-Adam, doubly celebrated as the cradle</p>
<p>of the family, now extinct, of Isle-Adam, and also as the former</p>
<p>residence of the Bourbon-Contis. Isle-Adam is a little town flanked by</p>
<p>two large villages, Nogent and Parmain, both remarkable for splendid</p>
<p>quarries, which have furnished material for many of the finest</p>
<p>buildings in modern Paris and in foreign lands,--for the base and</p>
<p>capital of the columns of the Brussels theatre are of Nogent stone.</p>
<p>Though remarkable for its beautiful sites, for the famous chateaux</p>
<p>which princes, monks, and designers have built, such as Cassan, Stors,</p>
<p>Le Val, Nointel, Persan, etc., this region had escaped competition in</p>
<p>1822, and was reached by two coaches only, working more or less in</p>
<p>harmony.</p>
<p>This exception to the rule of rivalry was founded on reasons that are</p>
<p>easy to understand. From the Cave, the point on the route to England</p>
<p>where a paved road (due to the luxury of the Princes of Conti) turned</p>
<p>off to Isle-Adam, the distance is six miles. No speculating enterprise</p>
<p>would make such a detour, for Isle-Adam was the terminus of the road,</p>
<p>which did not go beyond it. Of late years, another road has been made</p>
<p>between the valley of Montmorency and the valley of the Oise; but in</p>
<p>1822 the only road which led to Isle-Adam was the paved highway of the</p>
<p>Princes of Conti. Pierrotin and his colleague reigned, therefore, from</p>
<p>Paris to Isle-Adam, beloved by every one along the way. Pierrotin&#x27;s</p>
<p>vehicle, together with that of his comrade, and Pierrotin himself,</p>
<p>were so well known that even the inhabitants on the main road as far</p>
<p>as the Cave were in the habit of using them; for there was always</p>
<p>better chance of a seat to be had than in the Beaumont coaches, which</p>
<p>were almost always full. Pierrotin and his competitor were on the best</p>
<p>of terms. When the former started from Isle-Adam, the latter was</p>
<p>returning from Paris, and vice versa.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to speak of the rival. Pierrotin possessed the</p>
<p>sympathies of his region; besides, he is the only one of the two who</p>
<p>appears in this veracious narrative. Let it suffice you to know that</p>
<p>the two coach proprietors lived under a good understanding, rivalled</p>
<p>each other loyally, and obtained customers by honorable proceedings.</p>
<p>In Paris they used, for economy&#x27;s sake, the same yard, hotel, and</p>
<p>stable, the same coach-house, office, and clerk. This detail is alone</p>
<p>sufficient to show that Pierrotin and his competitor were, as the</p>
<p>popular saying is, &quot;good dough.&quot; The hotel at which they put up in</p>
<p>Paris, at the corner of the rue d&#x27;Enghien, is still there, and is</p>
<p>called the &quot;Lion d&#x27;Argent.&quot; The proprietor of the establishment, which</p>
<p>from time immemorial had lodged coachmen and coaches, drove himself</p>
<p>for the great company of Daumartin, which was so firmly established</p>
<p>that its neighbors, the Touchards, whose place of business was</p>
<p>directly opposite, never dreamed of starting a rival coach on the</p>
<p>Daumartin line.</p>
<p>Though the departures for Isle-Adam professed to take place at a fixed</p>
<p>hour, Pierrotin and his co-rival practised an indulgence in that</p>
<p>respect which won for them the grateful affection of the country-</p>
<p>people, and also violent remonstrances on the part of strangers</p>
<p>accustomed to the regularity of the great lines of public conveyances.</p>
<p>But the two conductors of these vehicles, which were half diligence,</p>
<p>half coucou, were invariably defended by their regular customers. The</p>
<p>afternoon departure at four o&#x27;clock usually lagged on till half-past,</p>
<p>while that of the morning, fixed for eight o&#x27;clock, was seldom known</p>
<p>to take place before nine. In this respect, however, the system was</p>
<p>elastic. In summer, that golden period for the coaching business, the</p>
<p>rule of departure, rigorous toward strangers, was often relaxed for</p>
<p>country customers. This method not infrequently enabled Pierrotin to</p>
<p>pocket two fares for one place, if a countryman came early and wanted</p>
<p>a seat already booked and paid for by some &quot;bird of passage&quot; who was,</p>
<p>unluckily for himself, a little late. Such elasticity will certainly</p>
<p>not commend itself to purists in morality; but Pierrotin and his</p>
<p>colleague justified it on the varied grounds of &quot;hard times,&quot; of their</p>
<p>losses during the winter months, of the necessity of soon getting</p>
<p>better coaches, and of the duty of keeping exactly to the rules</p>
<p>written on the tariff, copies of which were, however, never shown,</p>
<p>unless some chance traveller was obstinate enough to demand it.</p>
<p>Pierrotin, a man about forty years of age, was already the father of a</p>
<p>family. Released from the cavalry on the great disbandment of 1815,</p>
<p>the worthy fellow had succeeded his father, who for many years had</p>
<p>driven a coucou of capricious flight between Paris and Isle-Adam.</p>
<p>Having married the daughter of a small inn-keeper, he enlarged his</p>
<p>business, made it a regular service, and became noted for his</p>
<p>intelligence and a certain military precision. Active and decided in</p>
<p>his ways, Pierrotin (the name seems to have been a sobriquet)</p>
<p>contrived to give, by the vivacity of his countenance, an expression</p>
<p>of sly shrewdness to his ruddy and weather-stained visage which</p>
<p>suggested wit. He was not without that facility of speech which is</p>
<p>acquired chiefly through &quot;seeing life&quot; and other countries. His voice,</p>
<p>by dint of talking to his horses and shouting &quot;Gare!&quot; was rough; but</p>
<p>he managed to tone it down with the bourgeois. His clothing, like that</p>
<p>of all coachmen of the second class, consisted of stout boots, heavy</p>
<p>with nails, made at Isle-Adam, trousers of bottle-green velveteen,</p>
<p>waistcoat of the same, over which he wore, while exercising his</p>
<p>functions, a blue blouse, ornamented on the collar, shoulder-straps</p>
<p>and cuffs, with many-colored embroidery. A cap with a visor covered</p>
<p>his head. His military career had left in Pierrotin&#x27;s manners and</p>
<p>customs a great respect for all social superiority, and a habit of</p>
<p>obedience to persons of the upper classes; and though he never</p>
<p>willingly mingled with the lesser bourgeoisie, he always respected</p>
<p>women in whatever station of life they belonged. Nevertheless, by dint</p>
<p>of &quot;trundling the world,&quot;--one of his own expressions,--he had come to</p>
<p>look upon those he conveyed as so many walking parcels, who required</p>
<p>less care than the inanimate ones,--the essential object of a coaching</p>
<p>business.</p>
<p>Warned by the general movement which, since the Peace, was</p>
<p>revolutionizing his calling, Pierrotin would not allow himself to be</p>
<p>outdone by the progress of new lights. Since the beginning of the</p>
<p>summer season he had talked much of a certain large coach, ordered</p>
<p>from Farry, Breilmann, and Company, the best makers of diligences,--a</p>
<p>purchase necessitated by an increasing influx of travellers.</p>
<p>Pierrotin&#x27;s present establishment consisted of two vehicles. One,</p>
<p>which served in winter, and the only one he reported to the tax-</p>
<p>gatherer, was the coucou which he inherited from his father. The</p>
<p>rounded flanks of this vehicle allowed him to put six travellers on</p>
<p>two seats, of metallic hardness in spite of the yellow Utrecht velvet</p>
<p>with which they were covered. These seats were separated by a wooden</p>
<p>bar inserted in the sides of the carriage at the height of the</p>
<p>travellers&#x27; shoulders, which could be placed or removed at will. This</p>
<p>bar, specially covered with velvet (Pierrotin called it &quot;a back&quot;), was</p>
<p>the despair of the passengers, from the great difficulty they found in</p>
<p>placing and removing it. If the &quot;back&quot; was difficult and even painful</p>
<p>to handle, that was nothing to the suffering caused to the omoplates</p>
<p>when the bar was in place. But when it was left to lie loose across</p>
<p>the coach, it made both ingress and egress extremely perilous,</p>
<p>especially to women.</p>
<p>Though each seat of this vehicle, with rounded sides like those of a</p>
<p>pregnant woman, could rightfully carry only three passengers, it was</p>
<p>not uncommon to see eight persons on the two seats jammed together</p>
<p>like herrings in a barrel. Pierrotin declared that the travellers were</p>
<p>far more comfortable in a solid, immovable mass; whereas when only</p>
<p>three were on a seat they banged each other perpetually, and ran much</p>
<p>risk of injuring their hats against the roof by the violent jolting of</p>
<p>the roads. In front of the vehicle was a wooden bench where Pierrotin</p>
<p>sat, on which three travellers could perch; when there, they went, as</p>
<p>everybody knows, by the name of &quot;rabbits.&quot; On certain trips Pierrotin</p>
<p>placed four rabbits on the bench, and sat himself at the side, on a</p>
<p>sort of box placed below the body of the coach as a foot-rest for the</p>
<p>rabbits, which was always full of straw, or of packages that feared no</p>
<p>damage. The body of this particular coucou was painted yellow,</p>
<p>embellished along the top with a band of barber&#x27;s blue, on which could</p>
<p>be read, on the sides, in silvery white letters, &quot;Isle-Adam, Paris,&quot;</p>
<p>and across the back, &quot;Line to Isle-Adam.&quot;</p>
<p>Our descendants will be mightily mistaken if they fancy that thirteen</p>
<p>persons including Pierrotin were all that this vehicle could carry. On</p>
<p>great occasions it could take three more in a square compartment</p>
<p>covered with an awning, where the trunks, cases, and packages were</p>
<p>piled; but the prudent Pierrotin only allowed his regular customers to</p>
<p>sit there, and even they were not allowed to get in until at some</p>
<p>distance beyond the &quot;barriere.&quot; The occupants of the &quot;hen-roost&quot; (the</p>
<p>name given by conductors to this section of their vehicles) were made</p>
<p>to get down outside of every village or town where there was a post of</p>
<p>gendarmerie; the overloading forbidden by law, &quot;for the safety of</p>
<p>passengers,&quot; being too obvious to allow the gendarme on duty--always a</p>
<p>friend to Pierrotin--to avoid the necessity of reporting this flagrant</p>
<p>violation of the ordinances. Thus on certain Saturday nights and</p>
<p>Monday mornings, Pierrotin&#x27;s coucou &quot;trundled&quot; fifteen travellers; but</p>
<p>on such occasions, in order to drag it along, he gave his stout old</p>
<p>horse, called Rougeot, a mate in the person of a little beast no</p>
<p>bigger than a pony, about whose merits he had much to say. This little</p>
<p>horse was a mare named Bichette; she ate little, she was spirited, she</p>
<p>was indefatigable, she was worth her weight in gold.</p>
<p>&quot;My wife wouldn&#x27;t give her for that fat lazybones of a Rougeot!&quot; cried</p>
<p>Pierrotin, when some traveller would joke him about his epitome of a</p>
<p>horse.</p>
<p>The difference between this vehicle and the other consisted chiefly in</p>
<p>the fact that the other was on four wheels. This coach, of comical</p>
<p>construction, called the &quot;four-wheel-coach,&quot; held seventeen</p>
<p>travellers, though it was bound not to carry more than fourteen. It</p>
<p>rumbled so noisily that the inhabitants of Isle-Adam frequently said,</p>
<p>&quot;Here comes Pierrotin!&quot; when he was scarcely out of the forest which</p>
<p>crowns the slope of the valley. It was divided into two lobes, so to</p>
<p>speak: one, called the &quot;interior,&quot; contained six passengers on two</p>
<p>seats; the other, a sort of cabriolet constructed in front, was called</p>
<p>the &quot;coupe.&quot; This coupe was closed in with very inconvenient and</p>
<p>fantastic glass sashes, a description of which would take too much</p>
<p>space to allow of its being given here. The four-wheeled coach was</p>
<p>surmounted by a hooded &quot;imperial,&quot; into which Pierrotin managed to</p>
<p>poke six passengers; this space was inclosed by leather curtains.</p>
<p>Pierrotin himself sat on an almost invisible seat perched just below</p>
<p>the sashes of the coupe.</p>
<p>The master of the establishment paid the tax which was levied upon all</p>
<p>public conveyances on his coucou only, which was rated to carry six</p>
<p>persons; and he took out a special permit each time that he drove the</p>
<p>four-wheeler. This may seem extraordinary in these days, but when the</p>
<p>tax on vehicles was first imposed, it was done very timidly, and such</p>
<p>deceptions were easily practised by the coach proprietors, always</p>
<p>pleased to &quot;faire la queue&quot; (cheat of their dues) the government</p>
<p>officials, to use the argot of their vocabulary. Gradually the greedy</p>
<p>Treasury became severe; it forced all public conveyances not to roll</p>
<p>unless they carried two certificates,--one showing that they had been</p>
<p>weighed, the other that their taxes were duly paid. All things have</p>
<p>their salad days, even the Treasury; and in 1822 those days still</p>
<p>lasted. Often in summer, the &quot;four-wheel-coach,&quot; and the coucou</p>
<p>journeyed together, carrying between them thirty-two passengers,</p>
<p>though Pierrotin was only paying a tax on six. On these specially</p>
<p>lucky days the convoy started from the faubourg Saint-Denis at half-</p>
<p>past four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, and arrived gallantly at Isle-Adam</p>
<p>by ten at night. Proud of this service, which necessitated the hire of</p>
<p>an extra horse, Pierrotin was wont to say:--</p>
<p>&quot;We went at a fine pace!&quot;</p>
<p>But in order to do the twenty-seven miles in five hours with his</p>
<p>caravan, he was forced to omit certain stoppages along the road,--at</p>
<p>Saint-Brice, Moisselles, and La Cave.</p>
<p>The hotel du Lion d&#x27;Argent occupies a piece of land which is very deep</p>
<p>for its width. Though its frontage has only three or four windows on</p>
<p>the faubourg Saint-Denis, the building extends back through a long</p>
<p>court-yard, at the end of which are the stables, forming a large house</p>
<p>standing close against the division wall of the adjoining property.</p>
<p>The entrance is through a sort of passage-way beneath the floor of the</p>
<p>second story, in which two or three coaches had room to stand. In 1822</p>
<p>the offices of all the lines of coaches which started from the Lion</p>
<p>d&#x27;Argent were kept by the wife of the inn-keeper, who had as many</p>
<p>books as there were lines. She received the fares, booked the</p>
<p>passengers, and stowed away, good-naturedly, in her vast kitchen the</p>
<p>various packages and parcels to be transported. Travellers were</p>
<p>satisfied with this easy-going, patriarchal system. If they arrived</p>
<p>too soon, they seated themselves beneath the hood of the huge kitchen</p>
<p>chimney, or stood within the passage-way, or crossed to the Cafe de</p>
<p>l&#x27;Echiquier, which forms the corner of the street so named.</p>
<p>In the early days of the autumn of 1822, on a Saturday morning,</p>
<p>Pierrotin was standing, with his hands thrust into his pockets through</p>
<p>the apertures of his blouse, beneath the porte-cochere of the Lion</p>
<p>d&#x27;Argent, whence he could see, diagonally, the kitchen of the inn, and</p>
<p>through the long court-yard to the stables, which were defined in</p>
<p>black at the end of it. Daumartin&#x27;s diligence had just started,</p>
<p>plunging heavily after those of the Touchards. It was past eight</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock. Under the enormous porch or passage, above which could be</p>
<p>read on a long sign, &quot;Hotel du Lion d&#x27;Argent,&quot; stood the stablemen and</p>
<p>porters of the coaching-lines watching the lively start of the</p>
<p>vehicles which deceives so many travellers, making them believe that</p>
<p>the horses will be kept to that vigorous gait.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall I harness up, master?&quot; asked Pierrotin&#x27;s hostler, when there</p>
<p>was nothing more to be seen along the road.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a quarter-past eight, and I don&#x27;t see any travellers,&quot; replied</p>
<p>Pierrotin. &quot;Where have they poked themselves? Yes, harness up all the</p>
<p>same. And there are no parcels either! Twenty good Gods! a fine day</p>
<p>like this, and I&#x27;ve only four booked! A pretty state of things for a</p>
<p>Saturday! It is always the same when you want money! A dog&#x27;s life, and</p>
<p>a dog&#x27;s business!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you had more, where would you put them? There&#x27;s nothing left but</p>
<p>the cabriolet,&quot; said the hostler, intending to soothe Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;You forget the new coach!&quot; cried Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you really got it?&quot; asked the man, laughing, and showing a set</p>
<p>of teeth as white and broad as almonds.</p>
<p>&quot;You old good-for-nothing! It starts to-morrow, I tell you; and I want</p>
<p>at least eighteen passengers for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha, ha! a fine affair; it&#x27;ll warm up the road,&quot; said the hostler.</p>
<p>&quot;A coach like that which runs to Beaumont, hey? Flaming! painted red</p>
<p>and gold to make Touchard burst with envy! It takes three horses! I</p>
<p>have bought a mate for Rougeot, and Bichette will go finely in</p>
<p>unicorn. Come, harness up!&quot; added Pierrotin, glancing out towards the</p>
<p>street, and stuffing the tobacco into his clay pipe. &quot;I see a lady and</p>
<p>lad over there with packages under their arms; they are coming to the</p>
<p>Lion d&#x27;Argent, for they&#x27;ve turned a deaf ear to the coucous. Tiens,</p>
<p>tiens! seems to me I know that lady for an old customer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve often started empty, and arrived full,&quot; said his porter, still</p>
<p>by way of consolation.</p>
<p>&quot;But no parcels! Twenty good Gods! What a fate!&quot;</p>
<p>And Pierrotin sat down on one of the huge stone posts which protected</p>
<p>the walls of the building from the wheels of the coaches; but he did</p>
<p>so with an anxious, reflective air that was not habitual with him.</p>
<p>This conversation, apparently insignificant, had stirred up cruel</p>
<p>anxieties which were slumbering in his breast. What could there be to</p>
<p>trouble the heart of Pierrotin in a fine new coach? To shine upon &quot;the</p>
<p>road,&quot; to rival the Touchards, to magnify his own line, to carry</p>
<p>passengers who would compliment him on the conveniences due to the</p>
<p>progress of coach-building, instead of having to listen to perpetual</p>
<p>complaints of his &quot;sabots&quot; (tires of enormous width),--such was</p>
<p>Pierrotin&#x27;s laudable ambition; but, carried away with the desire to</p>
<p>outstrip his comrade on the line, hoping that the latter might some</p>
<p>day retire and leave to him alone the transportation to Isle-Adam, he</p>
<p>had gone too far. The coach was indeed ordered from Barry, Breilmann,</p>
<p>and Company, coach-builders, who had just substituted square English</p>
<p>springs for those called &quot;swan-necks,&quot; and other old-fashioned French</p>
<p>contrivances. But these hard and distrustful manufacturers would only</p>
<p>deliver over the diligence in return for coin. Not particularly</p>
<p>pleased to build a vehicle which would be difficult to sell if it</p>
<p>remained upon their hands, these long-headed dealers declined to</p>
<p>undertake it at all until Pierrotin had made a preliminary payment of</p>
<p>two thousand francs. To satisfy this precautionary demand, Pierrotin</p>
<p>had exhausted all his resources and all his credit. His wife, his</p>
<p>father-in-law, and his friends had bled. This superb diligence he had</p>
<p>been to see the evening before at the painter&#x27;s; all it needed now was</p>
<p>to be set a-rolling, but to make it roll, payment in full must, alas!</p>
<p>be made.</p>
<p>Now, a thousand francs were lacking to Pierrotin, and where to get</p>
<p>them he did not know. He was in debt to the master of the Lion</p>
<p>d&#x27;Argent; he was in danger of his losing his two thousand francs</p>
<p>already paid to the coach-builder, not counting five hundred for the</p>
<p>mate to Rougeot, and three hundred for new harnesses, on which he had</p>
<p>a three-months&#x27; credit. Driven by the fury of despair and the madness</p>
<p>of vanity, he had just openly declared that the new coach was to start</p>
<p>on the morrow. By offering fifteen hundred francs, instead of the two</p>
<p>thousand five hundred still due, he was in hopes that the softened</p>
<p>carriage-builders would give him his coach. But after a few moments&#x27;</p>
<p>meditation, his feelings led him to cry out aloud:--</p>
<p>&quot;No! they&#x27;re dogs! harpies! Suppose I appeal to Monsieur Moreau, the</p>
<p>steward at Presles? he is such a kind man,&quot; thought Pierrotin, struck</p>
<p>with a new idea. &quot;Perhaps he would take my note for six months.&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment a footman in livery, carrying a leather portmanteau and</p>
<p>coming from the Touchard establishment, where he had gone too late to</p>
<p>secure places as far as Chambly, came up and said:--</p>
<p>&quot;Are you Pierrotin?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say on,&quot; replied Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;If you would wait a quarter of an hour, you could take my master. If</p>
<p>not, I&#x27;ll carry back the portmanteau and try to find some other</p>
<p>conveyance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll wait two, three quarters, and throw a little in besides, my</p>
<p>lad,&quot; said Pierrotin, eyeing the pretty leather trunk, well buckled,</p>
<p>and bearing a brass plate with a coat of arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Very good; then take this,&quot; said the valet, ridding his shoulder of</p>
<p>the trunk, which Pierrotin lifted, weighed, and examined.</p>
<p>&quot;Here,&quot; he said to his porter, &quot;wrap it up carefully in soft hay and</p>
<p>put it in the boot. There&#x27;s no name upon it,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Monseigneur&#x27;s arms are there,&quot; replied the valet.</p>
<p>&quot;Monseigneur! Come and take a glass,&quot; said Pierrotin, nodding toward</p>
<p>the Cafe de l&#x27;Echiquier, whither he conducted the valet. &quot;Waiter, two</p>
<p>absinthes!&quot; he said, as he entered. &quot;Who is your master? and where is</p>
<p>he going? I have never seen you before,&quot; said Pierrotin to the valet</p>
<p>as they touched glasses.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s a good reason for that,&quot; said the footman. &quot;My master only</p>
<p>goes into your parts about once a year, and then in his own carriage.</p>
<p>He prefers the valley d&#x27;Orge, where he has the most beautiful park in</p>
<p>the neighborhood of Paris, a perfect Versailles, a family estate of</p>
<p>which he bears the name. Don&#x27;t you know Monsieur Moreau?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The steward of Presles?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. Monsieur le Comte is going down to spend a couple of days with</p>
<p>him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! then I&#x27;m to carry Monsieur le Comte de Serizy!&quot; cried the coach-</p>
<p>proprietor.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my land, neither more nor less. But listen! here&#x27;s a special</p>
<p>order. If you have any of the country neighbors in your coach you are</p>
<p>not to call him Monsieur le comte; he wants to travel &#x27;en cognito,&#x27;</p>
<p>and told me to be sure to say he would pay a handsome pourboire if he</p>
<p>was not recognized.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So! Has this secret journey anything to do with the affair which Pere</p>
<p>Leger, the farmer at the Moulineaux, came to Paris the other day to</p>
<p>settle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; replied the valet, &quot;but the fat&#x27;s in the fire. Last</p>
<p>night I was sent to the stable to order the Daumont carriage to be</p>
<p>ready to go to Presles at seven this morning. But when seven o&#x27;clock</p>
<p>came, Monsieur le comte countermanded it. Augustin, his valet de</p>
<p>chambre, attributes the change to the visit of a lady who called last</p>
<p>night, and again this morning,--he thought she came from the country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could she have told him anything against Monsieur Moreau?--the best</p>
<p>of men, the most honest of men, a king of men, hey! He might have made</p>
<p>a deal more than he has out of his position, if he&#x27;d chosen; I can</p>
<p>tell you that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then he was foolish,&quot; answered the valet, sententiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Monsieur le Serizy going to live at Presles at last?&quot; asked</p>
<p>Pierrotin; &quot;for you know they have just repaired and refurnished the</p>
<p>chateau. Do you think it is true he has already spent two hundred</p>
<p>thousand francs upon it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you or I had half what he has spent upon it, you and I would be</p>
<p>rich bourgeois. If Madame la comtesse goes there--ha! I tell you what!</p>
<p>no more ease and comfort for the Moreaus,&quot; said the valet, with an air</p>
<p>of mystery.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s a worthy man, Monsieur Moreau,&quot; remarked Pierrotin, thinking of</p>
<p>the thousand francs he wanted to get from the steward. &quot;He is a man</p>
<p>who makes others work, but he doesn&#x27;t cheapen what they do; and he</p>
<p>gets all he can out of the land--for his master. Honest man! He often</p>
<p>comes to Paris and gives me a good fee: he has lots of errands for me</p>
<p>to do in Paris; sometimes three or four packages a day,--either from</p>
<p>monsieur or madame. My bill for cartage alone comes to fifty francs a</p>
<p>month, more or less. If madame does set up to be somebody, she&#x27;s fond</p>
<p>of her children; and it is I who fetch them from school and take them</p>
<p>back; and each time she gives me five francs,--a real great lady</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t do better than that. And every time I have any one in the</p>
<p>coach belonging to them or going to see them, I&#x27;m allowed to drive up</p>
<p>to the chateau,--that&#x27;s all right, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They say Monsieur Moreau wasn&#x27;t worth three thousand francs when</p>
<p>Monsieur le comte made him steward of Presles,&quot; said the valet.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, since 1806, there&#x27;s seventeen years, and the man ought to have</p>
<p>made something at any rate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True,&quot; said the valet, nodding. &quot;Anyway, masters are very annoying;</p>
<p>and I hope, for Moreau&#x27;s sake, that he has made butter for his bread.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have often been to your house in the rue de la Chaussee d&#x27;Antin to</p>
<p>carry baskets of game,&quot; said Pierrotin, &quot;but I&#x27;ve never had the</p>
<p>advantage, so far of seeing either monsieur or madame.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur le comte is a good man,&quot; said the footman, confidentially.</p>
<p>&quot;But if he insists on your helping to keep up his cognito there&#x27;s</p>
<p>something in the wind. At any rate, so we think at the house; or else,</p>
<p>why should he countermand the Daumont,--why travel in a coucou? A peer</p>
<p>of France might afford to hire a cabriolet to himself, one would</p>
<p>think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A cabriolet would cost him forty francs to go there and back; for let</p>
<p>me tell you, if you don&#x27;t know it, that road was only made for</p>
<p>squirrels,--up-hill and down, down-hill and up!&quot; said Pierrotin. &quot;Peer</p>
<p>of France or bourgeois, they are all looking after the main chance,</p>
<p>and saving their money. If this journey concerns Monsieur Moreau,</p>
<p>faith, I&#x27;d be sorry any harm should come to him! Twenty good Gods!</p>
<p>hadn&#x27;t I better find some way of warning him?--for he&#x27;s a truly good</p>
<p>man, a kind man, a king of men, hey!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pooh! Monsieur le comte thinks everything of Monsieur Moreau,&quot;</p>
<p>replied the valet. &quot;But let me give you a bit of good advice. Every</p>
<p>man for himself in this world. We have enough to do to take care of</p>
<p>ourselves. Do what Monsieur le comte asks you to do, and all the more</p>
<p>because there&#x27;s no trifling with him. Besides, to tell the truth, the</p>
<p>count is generous. If you oblige him so far,&quot; said the valet, pointing</p>
<p>half-way down his little finger, &quot;he&#x27;ll send you on as far as that,&quot;</p>
<p>stretching out his arm to its full length.</p>
<p>This wise reflection, and the action that enforced it, had the effect,</p>
<p>coming from a man who stood as high as second valet to the Comte de</p>
<p>Serizy, of cooling the ardor of Pierrotin for the steward of Presles.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, adieu, Monsieur Pierrotin,&quot; said the valet.</p>
<p>A glance rapidly cast on the life of the Comte de Serizy, and on that</p>
<p>of his steward, is here necessary in order to fully understand the</p>
<p>little drama now about to take place in Pierrotin&#x27;s vehicle.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>THE STEWARD IN DANGER</p>
<p>Monsieur Huguet de Serisy descends in a direct line from the famous</p>
<p>president Huguet, ennobled under Francois I.</p>
<p>This family bears: party per pale or and sable, an orle counterchanged</p>
<p>and two lozenges counterchanged, with: &quot;i, semper melius eris,&quot;--a</p>
<p>motto which, together with the two distaffs taken as supporters,</p>
<p>proves the modesty of the burgher families in the days when the Orders</p>
<p>held their allotted places in the State; and the naivete of our</p>
<p>ancient customs by the pun on &quot;eris,&quot; which word, combined with the</p>
<p>&quot;i&quot; at the beginning and the final &quot;s&quot; in &quot;melius,&quot; forms the name</p>
<p>(Serisy) of the estate from which the family take their title.</p>
<p>The father of the present count was president of a parliament before</p>
<p>the Revolution. He himself a councillor of State at the Grand Council</p>
<p>of 1787, when he was only twenty-two years of age, was even then</p>
<p>distinguished for his admirable memoranda on delicate diplomatic</p>
<p>matters. He did not emigrate during the Revolution, and spent that</p>
<p>period on his estate of Serizy near Arpajon, where the respect in</p>
<p>which his father was held protected him from all danger. After</p>
<p>spending several years in taking care of the old president, who died</p>
<p>in 1794, he was elected about that time to the Council of the Five</p>
<p>Hundred, and accepted those legislative functions to divert his mind</p>
<p>from his grief. After the 18th Brumaire, Monsieur de Serizy became,</p>
<p>like so many other of the old parliamentary families, an object of the</p>
<p>First Consul&#x27;s blandishment. He was appointed to the Council of State,</p>
<p>and received one of the most disorganized departments of the</p>
<p>government to reconstruct. This scion of an old historical family</p>
<p>proved to be a very active wheel in the grand and magnificent</p>
<p>organization which we owe to Napoleon.</p>
<p>The councillor of State was soon called from his particular</p>
<p>administration to a ministry. Created count and senator by the</p>
<p>Emperor, he was made proconsul to two kingdoms in succession. In 1806,</p>
<p>when forty years of age, he married the sister of the ci-devant</p>
<p>Marquis de Ronquerolles, the widow at twenty of Gaubert, one of the</p>
<p>most illustrious of the Republican generals, who left her his whole</p>
<p>property. This marriage, a suitable one in point of rank, doubled the</p>
<p>already considerable fortune of the Comte de Serizy, who became</p>
<p>through his wife the brother-in-law of the ci-devant Marquis de</p>
<p>Rouvre, made count and chamberlain by the Emperor.</p>
<p>In 1814, weary with constant toil, the Comte de Serizy, whose</p>
<p>shattered health required rest, resigned all his posts, left the</p>
<p>department at the head of which the Emperor had placed him, and came</p>
<p>to Paris, where Napoleon was compelled by the evidence of his eyes to</p>
<p>admit that the count&#x27;s illness was a valid excuse, though at first</p>
<p>that UNFATIGUABLE master, who gave no heed to the fatigue of others,</p>
<p>was disposed to consider Monsieur de Serizy&#x27;s action as a defection.</p>
<p>Though the senator was never in disgrace, he was supposed to have</p>
<p>reason to complain of Napoleon. Consequently, when the Bourbons</p>
<p>returned, Louis XVIII., whom Monsieur de Serizy held to be his</p>
<p>legitimate sovereign, treated the senator, now a peer of France, with</p>
<p>the utmost confidence, placed him in charge of his private affairs,</p>
<p>and appointed him one of his cabinet ministers. On the 20th of March,</p>
<p>Monsieur de Serizy did not go to Ghent. He informed Napoleon that he</p>
<p>remained faithful to the house of Bourbon; would not accept his</p>
<p>peerage during the Hundred Days, and passed that period on his estate</p>
<p>at Serizy.</p>
<p>After the second fall of the Emperor, he became once more a privy-</p>
<p>councillor, was appointed vice-president of the Council of State, and</p>
<p>liquidator, on behalf of France, of claims and indemnities demanded by</p>
<p>foreign powers. Without personal assumption, without ambition even, he</p>
<p>possessed great influence in public affairs. Nothing of importance was</p>
<p>done without consulting him; but he never went to court, and was</p>
<p>seldom seen in his own salons. This noble life, devoting itself from</p>
<p>its very beginning to work, had ended by becoming a life of incessant</p>
<p>toil. The count rose at all seasons by four o&#x27;clock in the morning,</p>
<p>and worked till mid-day, attended to his functions as peer of France</p>
<p>and vice-president of the Council of State in the afternoons, and went</p>
<p>to bed at nine o&#x27;clock. In recognition of such labor, the King had</p>
<p>made him a knight of his various Orders. Monsieur de Serizy had long</p>
<p>worn the grand cross of the Legion of honor; he also had the orders of</p>
<p>the Golden Fleece, of Saint-Andrew of Russia, that of the Prussian</p>
<p>Eagle, and nearly all the lesser Orders of the courts of Europe. No</p>
<p>man was less obvious, or more useful in the political world than he.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand that the world&#x27;s honor, the fuss and feathers</p>
<p>of public favor, the glories of success were indifferent to a man of</p>
<p>this stamp; but no one, unless a priest, ever comes to life of this</p>
<p>kind without some serious underlying reason. His conduct had its</p>
<p>cause, and a cruel one.</p>
<p>In love with his wife before he married her, this passion had lasted</p>
<p>through all the secret unhappiness of his marriage with a widow,--a</p>
<p>woman mistress of herself before as well as after her second marriage,</p>
<p>and who used her liberty all the more freely because her husband</p>
<p>treated her with the indulgence of a mother for a spoilt child. His</p>
<p>constant toil served him as shield and buckler against pangs of heart</p>
<p>which he silenced with the care that diplomatists give to the keeping</p>
<p>of secrets. He knew, moreover, how ridiculous was jealousy in the eyes</p>
<p>of a society that would never have believed in the conjugal passion of</p>
<p>an old statesman. How happened it that from the earliest days of his</p>
<p>marriage his wife so fascinated him? Why did he suffer without</p>
<p>resistance? How was it that he dared not resist? Why did he let the</p>
<p>years go by and still hope on? By what means did this young and pretty</p>
<p>and clever woman hold him in bondage?</p>
<p>The answer to all these questions would require a long history, which</p>
<p>would injure our present tale. Let us only remark here that the</p>
<p>constant toil and grief of the count had unfortunately contributed not</p>
<p>a little to deprive him of personal advantages very necessary to a man</p>
<p>who attempts to struggle against dangerous comparisons. In fact, the</p>
<p>most cruel of the count&#x27;s secret sorrows was that of causing</p>
<p>repugnance to his wife by a malady of the skin resulting solely from</p>
<p>excessive labor. Kind, and always considerate of the countess, he</p>
<p>allowed her to be mistress of herself and her home. She received all</p>
<p>Paris; she went into the country; she returned from it precisely as</p>
<p>though she were still a widow. He took care of her fortune and</p>
<p>supplied her luxury as a steward might have done. The countess had the</p>
<p>utmost respect for her husband. She even admired his turn of mind; she</p>
<p>knew how to make him happy by approbation; she could do what she</p>
<p>pleased with him by simply going to his study and talking for an hour</p>
<p>with him. Like the great seigneurs of the olden time, the count</p>
<p>protected his wife so loyally that a single word of disrespect said of</p>
<p>her would have been to him an unpardonable injury. The world admired</p>
<p>him for this; and Madame de Serizy owed much to it. Any other woman,</p>
<p>even though she came of a family as distinguished as the Ronquerolles,</p>
<p>might have found herself degraded in public opinion. The countess was</p>
<p>ungrateful, but she mingled a charm with her ingratitude. From time to</p>
<p>time she shed a balm upon the wounds of her husband&#x27;s heart.</p>
<p>Let us now explain the meaning of this sudden journey, and the</p>
<p>incognito maintained by a minister of State.</p>
<p>A rich farmer of Beaumont-sur-Oise, named Leger, leased and cultivated</p>
<p>a farm, the fields of which projected into and greatly injured the</p>
<p>magnificent estate of the Comte de Serizy, called Presles. This farm</p>
<p>belonged to a burgher of Beaumont-sur-Oise, named Margueron. The lease</p>
<p>made to Leger in 1799, at a time when the great advance of agriculture</p>
<p>was not foreseen, was about to expire, and the owner of the farm</p>
<p>refused all offers from Leger to renew the lease. For some time past,</p>
<p>Monsieur de Serizy, wishing to rid himself of the annoyances and petty</p>
<p>disputes caused by the inclosure of these fields within his land, had</p>
<p>desired to buy the farm, having heard that Monsieur Margueron&#x27;s chief</p>
<p>ambition was to have his only son, then a mere tax-gatherer, made</p>
<p>special collector of finances at Beaumont. The farmer, who knew he</p>
<p>could sell the fields piecemeal to the count at a high price, was</p>
<p>ready to pay Margueron even more than he expected from the count.</p>
<p>Thus matters stood when, two days earlier than that of which we write,</p>
<p>Monsieur de Serizy, anxious to end the matter, sent for his notary,</p>
<p>Alexandre Crottat, and his lawyer, Derville, to examine into all the</p>
<p>circumstances of the affair. Though Derville and Crottat threw some</p>
<p>doubt on the zeal of the count&#x27;s steward (a disturbing letter from</p>
<p>whom had led to the consultation), Monsieur de Serizy defended Moreau,</p>
<p>who, he said, had served him faithfully for seventeen years.</p>
<p>&quot;Very well!&quot; said Derville, &quot;then I advise your Excellency to go to</p>
<p>Presles yourself, and invite this Margueron to dinner. Crottat will</p>
<p>send his head-clerk with a deed of sale drawn up, leaving only the</p>
<p>necessary lines for description of property and titles in blank. Your</p>
<p>Excellency should take with you part of the purchase money in a check</p>
<p>on the Bank of France, not forgetting the appointment of the son to</p>
<p>the collectorship. If you don&#x27;t settle the thing at once that farm</p>
<p>will slip through your fingers. You don&#x27;t know, Monsieur le comte, the</p>
<p>trickery of these peasants. Peasants against diplomat, and the</p>
<p>diplomat succumbs.&quot;</p>
<p>Crottat agreed in this advice, which the count, if we may judge by the</p>
<p>valet&#x27;s statements to Pierrotin, had adopted. The preceding evening he</p>
<p>had sent Moreau a line by the diligence to Beaumont, telling him to</p>
<p>invite Margueron to dinner in order that they might then and there</p>
<p>close the purchase of the farm of Moulineaux.</p>
<p>Before this matter came up, the count had already ordered the chateau</p>
<p>of Presles to be restored and refurnished, and for the last year,</p>
<p>Grindot, an architect then in fashion, was in the habit of making a</p>
<p>weekly visit. So, while concluding his purchase of the farm, Monsieur</p>
<p>de Serizy also intended to examine the work of restoration and the</p>
<p>effect of the new furniture. He intended all this to be a surprise to</p>
<p>his wife when he brought her to Presles, and with this idea in his</p>
<p>mind, he had put some personal pride and self-love into the work. How</p>
<p>came it therefore that the count, who intended in the evening to drive</p>
<p>to Presles openly in his own carriage, should be starting early the</p>
<p>next morning incognito in Pierrotin&#x27;s coucou?</p>
<p>Here a few words on the life of the steward Moreau become</p>
<p>indispensable.</p>
<p>Moreau, steward of the state of Presles, was the son of a provincial</p>
<p>attorney who became during the Revolution syndic-attorney at</p>
<p>Versailles. In that position, Moreau the father had been the means of</p>
<p>almost saving both the lives and property of the Serizys, father and</p>
<p>son. Citizen Moreau belonged to the Danton party; Robespierre,</p>
<p>implacable in his hatreds, pursued him, discovered him, and finally</p>
<p>had him executed at Versailles. Moreau the son, heir to the doctrines</p>
<p>and friendships of his father, was concerned in one of the</p>
<p>conspiracies which assailed the First Consul on his accession to</p>
<p>power. At this crisis, Monsieur de Serizy, anxious to pay his debt of</p>
<p>gratitude, enabled Moreau, lying under sentence of death, to make his</p>
<p>escape; in 1804 he asked for his pardon, obtained it, offered him</p>
<p>first a place in his government office, and finally took him as</p>
<p>private secretary for his own affairs.</p>
<p>Some time after the marriage of his patron Moreau fell in love with</p>
<p>the countess&#x27;s waiting-woman and married her. To avoid the annoyances</p>
<p>of the false position in which this marriage placed him (more than one</p>
<p>example of which could be seen at the imperial court), Moreau asked</p>
<p>the count to give him the management of the Presles estate, where his</p>
<p>wife could play the lady in a country region, and neither of them</p>
<p>would be made to suffer from wounded self-love. The count wanted a</p>
<p>trustworthy man at Presles, for his wife preferred Serizy, an estate</p>
<p>only fifteen miles from Paris. For three or four years Moreau had held</p>
<p>the key of the count&#x27;s affairs; he was intelligent, and before the</p>
<p>Revolution he had studied law in his father&#x27;s office; so Monsieur de</p>
<p>Serizy granted his request.</p>
<p>&quot;You can never advance in life,&quot; he said to Moreau, &quot;for you have</p>
<p>broken your neck; but you can be happy, and I will take care that you</p>
<p>are so.&quot;</p>
<p>He gave Moreau a salary of three thousand francs and his residence in</p>
<p>a charming lodge near the chateau, all the wood he needed from the</p>
<p>timber that was cut on the estate, oats, hay, and straw for two</p>
<p>horses, and a right to whatever he wanted of the produce of the</p>
<p>gardens. A sub-prefect is not as well provided for.</p>
<p>During the first eight years of his stewardship, Moreau managed the</p>
<p>estate conscientiously; he took an interest in it. The count, coming</p>
<p>down now and then to examine the property, pass judgment on what had</p>
<p>been done, and decide on new purchases, was struck with Moreau&#x27;s</p>
<p>evident loyalty, and showed his satisfaction by liberal gifts.</p>
<p>But after the birth of Moreau&#x27;s third child, a daughter, he felt</p>
<p>himself so securely settled in all his comforts at Presles that he</p>
<p>ceased to attribute to Monsieur de Serizy those enormous advantages.</p>
<p>About the year 1816, the steward, who until then had only taken what</p>
<p>he needed for his own use from the estate, accepted a sum of twenty-</p>
<p>five thousand francs from a wood-merchant as an inducement to lease to</p>
<p>the latter, for twelve years, the cutting of all the timber. Moreau</p>
<p>argued this: he could have no pension; he was the father of a family;</p>
<p>the count really owed him that sum as a gift after ten years&#x27;</p>
<p>management; already the legitimate possessor of sixty thousand francs</p>
<p>in savings, if he added this sum to that, he could buy a farm worth a</p>
<p>hundred and twenty-five thousand francs in Champagne, a township just</p>
<p>above Isle-Adam, on the right bank of the Oise. Political events</p>
<p>prevented both the count and the neighboring country-people from</p>
<p>becoming aware of this investment, which was made in the name of</p>
<p>Madame Moreau, who was understood to have inherited property from an</p>
<p>aunt of her father.</p>
<p>As soon as the steward had tasted the delightful fruit of the</p>
<p>possession of the property, he began, all the while maintaining toward</p>
<p>the world an appearance of the utmost integrity, to lose no occasion</p>
<p>of increasing his fortune clandestinely; the interests of his three</p>
<p>children served as a poultice to the wounds of his honor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we ought in justice to say that while he accepted casks</p>
<p>of wine, and took care of himself in all the purchases that he made</p>
<p>for the count, yet according to the terms of the Code he remained an</p>
<p>honest man, and no proof could have been found to justify an</p>
<p>accusation against him. According to the jurisprudence of the least</p>
<p>thieving cook in Paris, he shared with the count in the profits due to</p>
<p>his own capable management. This manner of swelling his fortune was</p>
<p>simply a case of conscience, that was all. Alert, and thoroughly</p>
<p>understanding the count&#x27;s interests, Moreau watched for opportunities</p>
<p>to make good purchases all the more eagerly, because he gained a</p>
<p>larger percentage on them. Presles returned a revenue of seventy</p>
<p>thousand francs net. It was a saying of the country-side for a circuit</p>
<p>of thirty miles:--</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur de Serizy has a second self in Moreau.&quot;</p>
<p>Being a prudent man, Moreau invested yearly, after 1817, both his</p>
<p>profits and his salary on the Grand Livre, piling up his heap with the</p>
<p>utmost secrecy. He often refused proposals on the plea of want of</p>
<p>money; and he played the poor man so successfully with the count that</p>
<p>the latter gave him the means to send both his sons to the school</p>
<p>Henri IV. At the present moment Moreau was worth one hundred and</p>
<p>twenty thousand francs of capital invested in the Consolidated thirds,</p>
<p>now paying five per cent, and quoted at eighty francs. These carefully</p>
<p>hidden one hundred and twenty thousand francs, and his farm at</p>
<p>Champagne, enlarged by subsequent purchases, amounted to a fortune of</p>
<p>about two hundred and eighty thousand francs, giving him an income of</p>
<p>some sixteen thousand.</p>
<p>Such was the position of the steward at the time when the Comte de</p>
<p>Serizy desired to purchase the farm of Moulineaux,--the ownership of</p>
<p>which was indispensable to his comfort. This farm consisted of ninety-</p>
<p>six parcels of land bordering the estate of Presles, and frequently</p>
<p>running into it, producing the most annoying discussions as to the</p>
<p>trimming of hedges and ditches and the cutting of trees. Any other</p>
<p>than a cabinet minister would probably have had scores of lawsuits on</p>
<p>his hands. Pere Leger only wished to buy the property in order to sell</p>
<p>to the count at a handsome advance. In order to secure the exorbitant</p>
<p>sum on which his mind was set, the farmer had long endeavored to come</p>
<p>to an understanding with Moreau. Impelled by circumstances, he had,</p>
<p>only three days before this critical Sunday, had a talk with the</p>
<p>steward in the open field, and proved to him clearly that he (Moreau)</p>
<p>could make the count invest his money at two and a half per cent, and</p>
<p>thus appear to serve his patron&#x27;s interests, while he himself pocketed</p>
<p>forty thousand francs which Leger offered him to bring about the</p>
<p>transaction.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you what,&quot; said the steward to his wife, as he went to bed</p>
<p>that night, &quot;if I make fifty thousand francs out of the Moulineaux</p>
<p>affair,--and I certainly shall, for the count will give me ten</p>
<p>thousand as a fee,--we&#x27;ll retire to Isle-Adam and live in the Pavillon</p>
<p>de Nogent.&quot;</p>
<p>This &quot;pavillon&quot; was a charming place, originally built by the Prince</p>
<p>de Conti for a mistress, and in it every convenience and luxury had</p>
<p>been placed.</p>
<p>&quot;That will suit me,&quot; said his wife. &quot;The Dutchman who lives there has</p>
<p>put it in good order, and now that he is obliged to return to India,</p>
<p>he would probably let us have it for thirty thousand francs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We shall be close to Champagne,&quot; said Moreau. &quot;I am in hopes of</p>
<p>buying the farm and mill of Mours for a hundred thousand francs. That</p>
<p>would give us ten thousand a year in rentals. Nogent is one of the</p>
<p>most delightful residences in the valley; and we should still have an</p>
<p>income of ten thousand from the Grand-Livre.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why don&#x27;t you ask for the post of juge-de-paix at Isle-Adam? That</p>
<p>would give us influence, and fifteen hundred a year salary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I did think of it.&quot;</p>
<p>With these plans in mind, Moreau, as soon as he heard from the count</p>
<p>that he was coming to Presles, and wished him to invite Margueron to</p>
<p>dinner on Saturday, sent off an express to the count&#x27;s head-valet,</p>
<p>inclosing a letter to his master, which the messenger failed to</p>
<p>deliver before Monsieur de Serizy retired at his usually early hour.</p>
<p>Augustin, however, placed it, according to custom in such cases, on</p>
<p>his master&#x27;s desk. In this letter Moreau begged the count not to</p>
<p>trouble himself to come down, but to trust entirely to him. He added</p>
<p>that Margueron was no longer willing to sell the whole in one block,</p>
<p>and talked of cutting the farm up into a number of smaller lots. It</p>
<p>was necessary to circumvent this plan, and perhaps, added Moreau, it</p>
<p>might be best to employ a third party to make the purchase.</p>
<p>Everybody has enemies in this life. Now the steward and his wife had</p>
<p>wounded the feelings of a retired army officer, Monsieur de Reybert,</p>
<p>and his wife, who were living near Presles. From speeches like pin-</p>
<p>pricks, matters had advanced to dagger-thrusts. Monsieur de Reybert</p>
<p>breathed vengeance. He was determined to make Moreau lose his</p>
<p>situation and gain it himself. The two ideas were twins. Thus the</p>
<p>proceedings of the steward, spied upon for two years, were no secret</p>
<p>to Reybert. The same conveyance that took Moreau&#x27;s letter to the count</p>
<p>conveyed Madame de Reybert, whom her husband despatched to Paris.</p>
<p>There she asked with such earnestness to see the count that although</p>
<p>she was sent away at nine o&#x27;clock, he having then gone to bed, she was</p>
<p>ushered into his study the next morning at seven.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; she said to the cabinet-minister, &quot;we are incapable, my</p>
<p>husband and I, of writing anonymous letters, therefore I have come to</p>
<p>see you in person. I am Madame de Reybert, nee de Corroy. My husband</p>
<p>is a retired officer, with a pension of six hundred francs, and we</p>
<p>live at Presles, where your steward has offered us insult after</p>
<p>insult, although we are persons of good station. Monsieur de Reybert,</p>
<p>who is not an intriguing man, far from it, is a captain of artillery,</p>
<p>retired in 1816, having served twenty years,--always at a distance</p>
<p>from the Emperor, Monsieur le comte. You know of course how difficult</p>
<p>it is for soldiers who are not under the eye of their master to obtain</p>
<p>promotion,--not counting that the integrity and frankness of Monsieur</p>
<p>de Reybert were displeasing to his superiors. My husband has watched</p>
<p>your steward for the last three years, being aware of his dishonesty</p>
<p>and intending to have him lose his place. We are, as you see, quite</p>
<p>frank with you. Moreau has made us his enemies, and we have watched</p>
<p>him. I have come to tell you that you are being tricked in the</p>
<p>purchase of the Moulineaux farm. They mean to get an extra hundred</p>
<p>thousand francs out of you, which are to be divided between the</p>
<p>notary, the farmer Leger, and Moreau. You have written Moreau to</p>
<p>invite Margueron, and you are going to Presles to-day; but Margueron</p>
<p>will be ill, and Leger is so certain of buying the farm that he is now</p>
<p>in Paris to draw the money. If we have enlightened you as to what is</p>
<p>going on, and if you want an upright steward you will take my husband;</p>
<p>though noble, he will serve you as he has served the State. Your</p>
<p>steward has made a fortune of two hundred and fifty thousand francs</p>
<p>out of his place; he is not to be pitied therefore.&quot;</p>
<p>The count thanked Madame de Reybert coldly, bestowing upon her the</p>
<p>holy-water of courts, for he despised backbiting; but for all that, he</p>
<p>remembered Derville&#x27;s doubts, and felt inwardly shaken. Just then he</p>
<p>saw his steward&#x27;s letter and read it. In its assurances of devotion</p>
<p>and its respectful reproaches for the distrust implied in wishing to</p>
<p>negotiate the purchase for himself, he read the truth.</p>
<p>&quot;Corruption has come to him with fortune,--as it always does!&quot; he said</p>
<p>to himself.</p>
<p>The count then made several inquiries of Madame de Reybert, less to</p>
<p>obtain information than to gain time to observe her; and he wrote a</p>
<p>short note to his notary telling him not to send his head-clerk to</p>
<p>Presles as requested, but to come there himself in time for dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Though Monsieur le comte,&quot; said Madame de Reybert in conclusion, &quot;may</p>
<p>have judged me unfavorably for the step I have taken unknown to my</p>
<p>husband, he ought to be convinced that we have obtained this</p>
<p>information about his steward in a natural and honorable manner; the</p>
<p>most sensitive conscience cannot take exception to it.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, Madame de Reybert, nee de Corroy, stood erect as a pike-</p>
<p>staff. She presented to the rapid investigation of the count a face</p>
<p>seamed with the small-pox like a colander with holes, a flat, spare</p>
<p>figure, two light and eager eyes, fair hair plastered down upon an</p>
<p>anxious forehead, a small drawn-bonnet of faded green taffetas lined</p>
<p>with pink, a white gown with violet spots, and leather shoes. The</p>
<p>count recognized the wife of some poor, half-pay captain, a puritan,</p>
<p>subscribing no doubt to the &quot;Courrier Francais,&quot; earnest in virtue,</p>
<p>but aware of the comfort of a good situation and eagerly coveting it.</p>
<p>&quot;You say your husband has a pension of six hundred francs,&quot; he said,</p>
<p>replying to his own thoughts, and not to the remark Madame de Reybert</p>
<p>had just made.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were born a Corroy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, monsieur,--a noble family of Metz, where my husband belongs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In what regiment did Monsieur de Reybert serve?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The 7th artillery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good!&quot; said the count, writing down the number.</p>
<p>He had thought at one time of giving the management of the estate to</p>
<p>some retired army officer, about whom he could obtain exact</p>
<p>information from the minister of war.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame,&quot; he resumed, ringing for his valet, &quot;return to Presles, this</p>
<p>afternoon with my notary, who is going down there for dinner, and to</p>
<p>whom I have recommended you. Here is his address. I am going myself</p>
<p>secretly to Presles, and will send for Monsieur de Reybert to come and</p>
<p>speak to me.&quot;</p>
<p>It will thus be seen that Monsieur de Serizy&#x27;s journey by a public</p>
<p>conveyance, and the injunction conveyed by the valet to conceal his</p>
<p>name and rank had not unnecessarily alarmed Pierrotin. That worthy had</p>
<p>just forebodings of a danger which was about to swoop down upon one of</p>
<p>his best customers.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>THE TRAVELLERS</p>
<p>As Pierrotin issued from the Cafe de l&#x27;Echiquier, after treating the</p>
<p>valet, he saw in the gate-way of the Lion d&#x27;Argent the lady and the</p>
<p>young man in whom his perspicacity at once detected customers, for the</p>
<p>lady with outstretched neck and anxious face was evidently looking for</p>
<p>him. She was dressed in a black-silk gown that was dyed, a brown</p>
<p>bonnet, an old French cashmere shawl, raw-silk stockings, and low</p>
<p>shoes; and in her hand she carried a straw bag and a blue umbrella.</p>
<p>This woman, who had once been beautiful, seemed to be about forty</p>
<p>years of age; but her blue eyes, deprived of the fire which happiness</p>
<p>puts there, told plainly that she had long renounced the world. Her</p>
<p>dress, as well as her whole air and demeanor, indicated a mother</p>
<p>wholly devoted to her household and her son. If the strings of her</p>
<p>bonnet were faded, the shape betrayed that it was several years old.</p>
<p>The shawl was fastened by a broken needle converted into a pin by a</p>
<p>bead of sealing-wax. She was waiting impatiently for Pierrotin,</p>
<p>wishing to recommend to his special care her son, who was doubtless</p>
<p>travelling for the first time, and with whom she had come to the</p>
<p>coach-office as much from doubt of his ability as from maternal</p>
<p>affection.</p>
<p>This mother was in every way completed by the son, so that the son</p>
<p>would not be understood without the mother. If the mother condemned</p>
<p>herself to mended gloves, the son wore an olive-green coat with</p>
<p>sleeves too short for him, proving that he had grown, and might grow</p>
<p>still more, like other adults of eighteen or nineteen years of age.</p>
<p>The blue trousers, mended by his mother, presented to the eye a</p>
<p>brighter patch of color when the coat-tails maliciously parted behind</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t rub your gloves that way, you&#x27;ll spoil them,&quot; she was saying as</p>
<p>Pierrotin appeared. &quot;Is this the conductor? Ah! Pierrotin, is it you?&quot;</p>
<p>she exclaimed, leaving her son and taking the coachman apart a few</p>
<p>steps.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you&#x27;re well, Madame Clapart,&quot; he replied, with an air that</p>
<p>expressed both respect and familiarity.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Pierrotin, very well. Please take good care of my Oscar; he is</p>
<p>travelling alone for the first time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! so he is going alone to Monsieur Moreau!&quot; cried Pierrotin, for</p>
<p>the purpose of finding out whether he were really going there.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the mother.</p>
<p>&quot;Then Madame Moreau is willing?&quot; returned Pierrotin, with a sly look.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the mother, &quot;it will not be all roses for him, poor child!</p>
<p>But his future absolutely requires that I should send him.&quot;</p>
<p>This answer struck Pierrotin, who hesitated to confide his fears for</p>
<p>the steward to Madame Clapart, while she, on her part, was afraid of</p>
<p>injuring her boy if she asked Pierrotin for a care which might have</p>
<p>transformed him into a mentor. During this short deliberation, which</p>
<p>was ostensibly covered by a few phrases as to the weather, the</p>
<p>journey, and the stopping-places along the road, we will ourselves</p>
<p>explain what were the ties that united Madame Clapart with Pierrotin,</p>
<p>and authorized the two confidential remarks which they have just</p>
<p>exchanged.</p>
<p>Often--that is to say, three or four times a month--Pierrotin, on his</p>
<p>way to Paris, would find the steward on the road near La Cave. As soon</p>
<p>as the vehicle came up, Moreau would sign to a gardener, who, with</p>
<p>Pierrotin&#x27;s help, would put upon the coach either one or two baskets</p>
<p>containing the fruits and vegetables of the season, chickens, eggs,</p>
<p>butter, and game. The steward always paid the carriage and Pierrotin&#x27;s</p>
<p>fee, adding the money necessary to pay the toll at the barriere, if</p>
<p>the baskets contained anything dutiable. These baskets, hampers, or</p>
<p>packages, were never directed to any one. On the first occasion, which</p>
<p>served for all others, the steward had given Madame Clapart&#x27;s address</p>
<p>by word of mouth to the discreet Pierrotin, requesting him never to</p>
<p>deliver to others the precious packages. Pierrotin, impressed with the</p>
<p>idea of an intrigue between the steward and some pretty girl, had gone</p>
<p>as directed to number 7 rue de la Cerisaie, in the Arsenal quarter,</p>
<p>and had there found the Madame Clapart just portrayed, instead of the</p>
<p>young and beautiful creature he expected to find.</p>
<p>The drivers of public conveyances and carriers are called by their</p>
<p>business to enter many homes, and to be cognizant of many secrets; but</p>
<p>social accident, that sub-providence, having willed that they be</p>
<p>without education and devoid of the talent of observation, it follows</p>
<p>that they are not dangerous. Nevertheless, at the end of a few months,</p>
<p>Pierrotin was puzzled to explain the exact relations of Monsieur</p>
<p>Moreau and Madame Clapart from what he saw of the household in the rue</p>
<p>de la Cerisaie. Though lodgings were not dear at that time in the</p>
<p>Arsenal quarter, Madame Clapart lived on a third floor at the end of a</p>
<p>court-yard, in a house which was formerly that of a great family, in</p>
<p>the days when the higher nobility of the kingdom lived on the ancient</p>
<p>site of the Palais des Tournelles and the hotel Saint-Paul. Toward the</p>
<p>end of the sixteenth century, the great seigneurs divided among</p>
<p>themselves these vast spaces, once occupied by the gardens of the</p>
<p>kings of France, as indicated by the present names of the streets,--</p>
<p>Cerisaie, Beautreillis, des Lions, etc. Madame Clapart&#x27;s apartment,</p>
<p>which was panelled throughout with ancient carvings, consisted of</p>
<p>three connecting rooms, a dining-room, salon, and bedroom. Above it</p>
<p>was the kitchen, and a bedroom for Oscar. Opposite to the entrance, on</p>
<p>what is called in Paris &quot;le carre,&quot;--that is, the square landing,--was</p>
<p>the door of a back room, opening, on every floor, into a sort of tower</p>
<p>built of rough stone, in which was also the well for the staircase.</p>
<p>This was the room in which Moreau slept whenever he went to Paris.</p>
<p>Pierrotin had seen in the first room, where he deposited the hampers,</p>
<p>six wooden chairs with straw seats, a table, and a sideboard; at the</p>
<p>windows, discolored curtains. Later, when he entered the salon, he</p>
<p>noticed some old Empire furniture, now shabby; but only as much as all</p>
<p>proprietors exact to secure their rent. Pierrotin judged of the</p>
<p>bedroom by the salon and dining-room. The wood-work, painted coarsely</p>
<p>of a reddish white, which thickened and blurred the mouldings and</p>
<p>figurines, far from being ornamental, was distressing to the eye. The</p>
<p>floors, never waxed, were of that gray tone we see in boarding-</p>
<p>schools. When Pierrotin came upon Monsieur and Madame Clapart at their</p>
<p>meals he saw that their china, glass, and all other little articles</p>
<p>betrayed the utmost poverty; and yet, though the chipped and mended</p>
<p>dishes and tureens were those of the poorest families and provoked</p>
<p>pity, the forks and spoons were of silver.</p>
<p>Monsieur Clapart, clothed in a shabby surtout, his feet in broken</p>
<p>slippers, always wore green spectacles, and exhibited, whenever he</p>
<p>removed his shabby cap of a bygone period, a pointed skull, from the</p>
<p>top of which trailed a few dirty filaments which even a poet could</p>
<p>scarcely call hair. This man, of wan complexion, seemed timorous, but</p>
<p>withal tyrannical.</p>
<p>In this dreary apartment, which faced the north and had no other</p>
<p>outlook than to a vine on the opposite wall and a well in the corner</p>
<p>of the yard, Madame Clapart bore herself with the airs of a queen, and</p>
<p>moved like a woman unaccustomed to go anywhere on foot. Often, while</p>
<p>thanking Pierrotin, she gave him glances which would have touched to</p>
<p>pity an intelligent observer; from time to time she would slip a</p>
<p>twelve-sous piece into his hand, and then her voice was charming.</p>
<p>Pierrotin had never seen Oscar, for the reason that the boy was always</p>
<p>in school at the time his business took him to the house.</p>
<p>Here is the sad story which Pierrotin could never have discovered,</p>
<p>even by asking for information, as he sometimes did, from the portress</p>
<p>of the house; for that individual knew nothing beyond the fact that</p>
<p>the Claparts paid a rent of two hundred and fifty francs a year, had</p>
<p>no servant but a charwoman who came daily for a few hours in the</p>
<p>morning, that Madame Clapart did some of her smaller washing herself,</p>
<p>and paid the postage on her letters daily, being apparently unable to</p>
<p>let the sum accumulate.</p>
<p>There does not exist, or rather, there seldom exists, a criminal who</p>
<p>is wholly criminal. Neither do we ever meet with a dishonest nature</p>
<p>which is completely dishonest. It is possible for a man to cheat his</p>
<p>master to his own advantage, or rake in for himself alone all the hay</p>
<p>in the manger, but, even while laying up capital by actions more or</p>
<p>less illicit, there are few men who never do good ones. If only from</p>
<p>self-love, curiosity, or by way of variety, or by chance, every man</p>
<p>has his moment of beneficence; he may call it his error, he may never</p>
<p>do it again, but he sacrifices to Goodness, as the most surly man</p>
<p>sacrifices to the Graces once or twice in his life. If Moreau&#x27;s faults</p>
<p>can ever be excused, it might be on the score of his persistent</p>
<p>kindness in succoring a woman of whose favors he had once been proud,</p>
<p>and in whose house he was hidden when in peril of his life.</p>
<p>This woman, celebrated under the Directory for her liaison with one of</p>
<p>the five kings of that reign, married, through that all-powerful</p>
<p>protection, a purveyor who was making his millions out of the</p>
<p>government, and whom Napoleon ruined in 1802. This man, named Husson,</p>
<p>became insane through his sudden fall from opulence to poverty; he</p>
<p>flung himself into the Seine, leaving the beautiful Madame Husson</p>
<p>pregnant. Moreau, very intimately allied with Madame Husson, was at</p>
<p>that time condemned to death; he was unable therefore to marry the</p>
<p>widow, being forced to leave France. Madame Husson, then twenty-two</p>
<p>years old, married in her deep distress a government clerk named</p>
<p>Clapart, aged twenty-seven, who was said to be a rising man. At that</p>
<p>period of our history, government clerks were apt to become persons of</p>
<p>importance; for Napoleon was ever on the lookout for capacity. But</p>
<p>Clapart, though endowed by nature with a certain coarse beauty, proved</p>
<p>to have no intelligence. Thinking Madame Husson very rich, he feigned</p>
<p>a great passion for her, and was simply saddled with the impossibility</p>
<p>of satisfying either then or in the future the wants she had acquired</p>
<p>in a life of opulence. He filled, very poorly, a place in the Treasury</p>
<p>that gave him a salary of eighteen hundred francs; which was all the</p>
<p>new household had to live on. When Moreau returned to France as the</p>
<p>secretary of the Comte de Serizy he heard of Madame Husson&#x27;s pitiable</p>
<p>condition, and he was able, before his own marriage, to get her an</p>
<p>appointment as head-waiting-woman to Madame Mere, the Emperor&#x27;s</p>
<p>mother. But in spite of that powerful protection Clapart was never</p>
<p>promoted; his incapacity was too apparent.</p>
<p>Ruined in 1815 by the fall of the Empire, the brilliant Aspasia of the</p>
<p>Directory had no other resources than Clapart&#x27;s salary of twelve</p>
<p>hundred francs from a clerkship obtained for him through the Comte de</p>
<p>Serizy. Moreau, the only protector of a woman whom he had known in</p>
<p>possession of millions, obtained a half-scholarship for her son, Oscar</p>
<p>Husson, at the school of Henri IV.; and he sent her regularly, by</p>
<p>Pierrotin, such supplies from the estate at Presles as he could</p>
<p>decently offer to a household in distress.</p>
<p>Oscar was the whole life and all the future of his mother. The poor</p>
<p>woman could now be reproached with no other fault than her exaggerated</p>
<p>tenderness for her boy,--the bete-noire of his step-father. Oscar was,</p>
<p>unfortunately, endowed by nature with a foolishness his mother did not</p>
<p>perceive, in spite of the step-father&#x27;s sarcasms. This foolishness--</p>
<p>or, to speak more specifically, this overweening conceit--so troubled</p>
<p>Monsieur Moreau that he begged Madame Clapart to send the boy down to</p>
<p>him for a month that he might study his character, and find out what</p>
<p>career he was fit for. Moreau was really thinking of some day</p>
<p>proposing Oscar to the count as his successor.</p>
<p>But to give to the devil and to God what respectively belongs to them,</p>
<p>perhaps it would be well to show the causes of Oscar Husson&#x27;s silly</p>
<p>self-conceit, premising that he was born in the household of Madame</p>
<p>Mere. During his early childhood his eyes were dazzled by imperial</p>
<p>splendors. His pliant imagination retained the impression of those</p>
<p>gorgeous scenes, and nursed the images of a golden time of pleasure in</p>
<p>hopes of recovering them. The natural boastfulness of school-boys</p>
<p>(possessed of a desire to outshine their mates) resting on these</p>
<p>memories of his childhood was developed in him beyond all measure. It</p>
<p>may also have been that his mother at home dwelt too fondly on the</p>
<p>days when she herself was a queen in Directorial Paris. At any rate,</p>
<p>Oscar, who was now leaving school, had been made to bear many</p>
<p>humiliations which the paying pupils put upon those who hold</p>
<p>scholarships, unless the scholars are able to impose respect by</p>
<p>superior physical ability.</p>
<p>This mixture of former splendor now departed, of beauty gone, of blind</p>
<p>maternal love, of sufferings heroically borne, made the mother one of</p>
<p>those pathetic figures which catch the eye of many an observer in</p>
<p>Paris.</p>
<p>Incapable, naturally, of understanding the real attachment of Moreau</p>
<p>to this woman, or that of the woman for the man she had saved in 1797,</p>
<p>now her only friend, Pierrotin did not think it best to communicate</p>
<p>the suspicion that had entered his head as to some danger which was</p>
<p>threatening Moreau. The valet&#x27;s speech, &quot;We have enough to do in this</p>
<p>world to look after ourselves,&quot; returned to his mind, and with it came</p>
<p>that sentiment of obedience to what he called the &quot;chefs de file,&quot;--</p>
<p>the front-rank men in war, and men of rank in peace. Besides, just now</p>
<p>Pierrotin&#x27;s head was as full of his own stings as there are five-franc</p>
<p>pieces in a thousand francs. So that the &quot;Very good, madame,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, madame,&quot; with which he replied to the poor mother, to whom</p>
<p>a trip of twenty miles appeared a journey, showed plainly that he</p>
<p>desired to get away from her useless and prolix instructions.</p>
<p>&quot;You will be sure to place the packages so that they cannot get wet if</p>
<p>the weather should happen to change.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve a hood,&quot; replied Pierrotin. &quot;Besides, see, madame, with what</p>
<p>care they are being placed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oscar, don&#x27;t stay more than two weeks, no matter how much they may</p>
<p>ask you,&quot; continued Madame Clapart, returning to her son. &quot;You can&#x27;t</p>
<p>please Madame Moreau, whatever you do; besides, you must be home by</p>
<p>the end of September. We are to go to Belleville, you know, to your</p>
<p>uncle Cardot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, mamma.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Above all,&quot; she said, in a low voice, &quot;be sure never to speak about</p>
<p>servants; keep thinking all the time that Madame Moreau was once a</p>
<p>waiting-maid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, mamma.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar, like all youths whose vanity is excessively ticklish, seemed</p>
<p>annoyed at being lectured on the threshold of the Lion d&#x27;Argent.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, now good-bye, mamma. We shall start soon; there&#x27;s the horse all</p>
<p>harnessed.&quot;</p>
<p>The mother, forgetting that she was in the open street, embraced her</p>
<p>Oscar, and said, smiling, as she took a little roll from her basket:--</p>
<p>&quot;Tiens! you were forgetting your roll and the chocolate! My child,</p>
<p>once more, I repeat, don&#x27;t take anything at the inns; they&#x27;d make you</p>
<p>pay for the slightest thing ten times what it is worth.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar would fain have seen his mother farther off as she stuffed the</p>
<p>bread and chocolate into his pocket. The scene had two witnesses,--two</p>
<p>young men a few years older than Oscar, better dressed than he,</p>
<p>without a mother hanging on to them, whose actions, dress, and ways</p>
<p>all betokened that complete independence which is the one desire of a</p>
<p>lad still tied to his mother&#x27;s apron-strings.</p>
<p>&quot;He said MAMMA!&quot; cried one of the new-comers, laughing.</p>
<p>The words reached Oscar&#x27;s ears and drove him to say, &quot;Good-bye,</p>
<p>mother!&quot; in a tone of terrible impatience.</p>
<p>Let us admit that Madame Clapart spoke too loudly, and seemed to wish</p>
<p>to show to those around them her tenderness for the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;What is the matter with you, Oscar?&quot; asked the poor hurt woman. &quot;I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know what to make of you,&quot; she added in a severe tone, fancying</p>
<p>herself able to inspire him with respect,--a great mistake made by</p>
<p>those who spoil their children. &quot;Listen, my Oscar,&quot; she said, resuming</p>
<p>at once her tender voice, &quot;you have a propensity to talk, and to tell</p>
<p>all you know, and all that you don&#x27;t know; and you do it to show off,</p>
<p>with the foolish vanity of a mere lad. Now, I repeat, endeavor to keep</p>
<p>your tongue in check. You are not sufficiently advanced in life, my</p>
<p>treasure, to be able to judge of the persons with whom you may be</p>
<p>thrown; and there is nothing more dangerous than to talk in public</p>
<p>conveyances. Besides, in a diligence well-bred persons always keep</p>
<p>silence.&quot;</p>
<p>The two young men, who seemed to have walked to the farther end of the</p>
<p>establishment, here returned, making their boot-heels tap upon the</p>
<p>paved passage of the porte-cochere. They might have heard the whole of</p>
<p>this maternal homily. So, in order to rid himself of his mother, Oscar</p>
<p>had recourse to an heroic measure, which proved how vanity stimulates</p>
<p>the intellect.</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma,&quot; he said, &quot;you are standing in a draught, and you may take</p>
<p>cold. Besides, I am going to get into the coach.&quot;</p>
<p>The lad must have touched some tender spot, for his mother caught him</p>
<p>to her bosom, kissed him as if he were starting upon a long journey,</p>
<p>and went with him to the vehicle with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t forget to give five francs to the servants when you come away,&quot;</p>
<p>she said; &quot;write me three times at least during the fifteen days;</p>
<p>behave properly, and remember all that I have told you. You have linen</p>
<p>enough; don&#x27;t send any to the wash. And above all, remember Monsieur</p>
<p>Moreau&#x27;s kindness; mind him as you would a father, and follow his</p>
<p>advice.&quot;</p>
<p>As he got into the coach, Oscar&#x27;s blue woollen stockings became</p>
<p>visible, through the action of his trousers which drew up suddenly,</p>
<p>also the new patch in the said trousers was seen, through the parting</p>
<p>of his coat-tails. The smiles of the two young men, on whom these</p>
<p>signs of an honorable indigence were not lost, were so many fresh</p>
<p>wounds to the lad&#x27;s vanity.</p>
<p>&quot;The first place was engaged for Oscar,&quot; said the mother to Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the back seat,&quot; she said to the boy, looking fondly at him with</p>
<p>a loving smile.</p>
<p>Oh! how Oscar regretted that trouble and sorrow had destroyed his</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s beauty, and that poverty and self-sacrifice prevented her</p>
<p>from being better dressed! One of the young men, the one who wore top-</p>
<p>boots and spurs, nudged the other to make him take notice of Oscar&#x27;s</p>
<p>mother, and the other twirled his moustache with a gesture which</p>
<p>signified,--</p>
<p>&quot;Rather pretty figure!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How shall I ever get rid of mamma?&quot; thought Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot; asked Madame Clapart.</p>
<p>Oscar pretended not to hear, the monster! Perhaps Madame Clapart was</p>
<p>lacking in tact under the circumstances; but all absorbing sentiments</p>
<p>have so much egotism!</p>
<p>&quot;Georges, do you like children when travelling?&quot; asked one young man</p>
<p>of the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my good Amaury, if they are weaned, and are named Oscar, and</p>
<p>have chocolate.&quot;</p>
<p>These speeches were uttered in half-tones to allow Oscar to hear them</p>
<p>or not hear them as he chose; his countenance was to be the weather-</p>
<p>gauge by which the other young traveller could judge how much fun he</p>
<p>might be able to get out of the lad during the journey. Oscar chose</p>
<p>not to hear. He looked to see if his mother, who weighed upon him like</p>
<p>a nightmare, was still there, for he felt that she loved him too well</p>
<p>to leave him so quickly. Not only did he involuntarily compare the</p>
<p>dress of his travelling companion with his own, but he felt that his</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s toilet counted for much in the smiles of the two young men.</p>
<p>&quot;If they would only take themselves off!&quot; he said to himself.</p>
<p>Instead of that, Amaury remarked to Georges, giving a tap with his</p>
<p>cane to the heavy wheel of the coucou:</p>
<p>&quot;And so, my friend, you are really going to trust your future to this</p>
<p>fragile bark?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must,&quot; replied Georges, in a tone of fatalism.</p>
<p>Oscar gave a sigh as he remarked the jaunty manner in which his</p>
<p>companion&#x27;s hat was stuck on one ear for the purpose of showing a</p>
<p>magnificent head of blond hair beautifully brushed and curled; while</p>
<p>he, by order of his step-father, had his black hair cut like a</p>
<p>clothes-brush across the forehead, and clipped, like a soldier&#x27;s,</p>
<p>close to the head. The face of the vain lad was round and chubby and</p>
<p>bright with the hues of health, while that of his fellow-traveller was</p>
<p>long, and delicate, and pale. The forehead of the latter was broad,</p>
<p>and his chest filled out a waistcoat of cashmere pattern. As Oscar</p>
<p>admired the tight-fitting iron-gray trousers and the overcoat with its</p>
<p>frogs and olives clasping the waist, it seemed to him that this</p>
<p>romantic-looking stranger, gifted with such advantages, insulted him</p>
<p>by his superiority, just as an ugly woman feels injured by the mere</p>
<p>sight of a pretty one. The click of the stranger&#x27;s boot-heels offended</p>
<p>his taste and echoed in his heart. He felt as hampered by his own</p>
<p>clothes (made no doubt at home out of those of his step-father) as</p>
<p>that envied young man seemed at ease in his.</p>
<p>&quot;That fellow must have heaps of francs in his trousers pocket,&quot;</p>
<p>thought Oscar.</p>
<p>The young man turned round. What were Oscar&#x27;s feelings on beholding a</p>
<p>gold chain round his neck, at the end of which no doubt was a gold</p>
<p>watch! From that moment the young man assumed, in Oscar&#x27;s eyes, the</p>
<p>proportions of a personage.</p>
<p>Living in the rue de la Cerisaie since 1815, taken to and from school</p>
<p>by his step-father, Oscar had no other points of comparison since his</p>
<p>adolescence than the poverty-stricken household of his mother. Brought</p>
<p>up strictly, by Moreau&#x27;s advice, he seldom went to the theatre, and</p>
<p>then to nothing better than the Ambigu-Comique, where his eyes could</p>
<p>see little elegance, if indeed the eyes of a child riveted on a</p>
<p>melodrama were likely to examine the audience. His step-father still</p>
<p>wore, after the fashion of the Empire, his watch in the fob of his</p>
<p>trousers, from which there depended over his abdomen a heavy gold</p>
<p>chain, ending in a bunch of heterogeneous ornaments, seals, and a</p>
<p>watch-key with a round top and flat sides, on which was a landscape in</p>
<p>mosaic. Oscar, who considered that old-fashioned finery as the &quot;ne</p>
<p>plus ultra&quot; of adornment, was bewildered by the present revelation of</p>
<p>superior and negligent elegance. The young man exhibited, offensively,</p>
<p>a pair of spotless gloves, and seemed to wish to dazzle Oscar by</p>
<p>twirling with much grace a gold-headed switch cane.</p>
<p>Oscar had reached that last quarter of adolescence when little things</p>
<p>cause immense joys and immense miseries,--a period when youth prefers</p>
<p>misfortune to a ridiculous suit of clothes, and caring nothing for the</p>
<p>real interests of life, torments itself about frivolities, about</p>
<p>neckcloths, and the passionate desire to appear a man. Then the young</p>
<p>fellow swells himself out; his swagger is all the more portentous</p>
<p>because it is exercised on nothings. Yet if he envies a fool who is</p>
<p>elegantly dressed, he is also capable of enthusiasm over talent, and</p>
<p>of genuine admiration for genius. Such defects as these, when they</p>
<p>have no root in the heart, prove only the exuberance of sap,--the</p>
<p>richness of the youthful imagination. That a lad of nineteen, an only</p>
<p>child, kept severely at home by poverty, adored by a mother who put</p>
<p>upon herself all privations for his sake, should be moved to envy by a</p>
<p>young man of twenty-two in a frogged surtout-coat silk-lined, a waist-</p>
<p>coat of fancy cashmere, and a cravat slipped through a ring of the</p>
<p>worse taste, is nothing more than a peccadillo committed in all ranks</p>
<p>of social life by inferiors who envy those that seem beyond them. Men</p>
<p>of genius themselves succumb to this primitive passion. Did not</p>
<p>Rousseau admire Ventura and Bacle?</p>
<p>But Oscar passed from peccadillo to evil feelings. He felt humiliated;</p>
<p>he was angry with the youth he envied, and there rose in his heart a</p>
<p>secret desire to show openly that he himself was as good as the object</p>
<p>of his envy.</p>
<p>The two young fellows continued to walk up and own from the gate to</p>
<p>the stables, and from the stables to the gate. Each time they turned</p>
<p>they looked at Oscar curled up in his corner of the coucou. Oscar,</p>
<p>persuaded that their jokes and laughter concerned himself, affected</p>
<p>the utmost indifference. He began to hum the chorus of a song lately</p>
<p>brought into vogue by the liberals, which ended with the words, &quot;&#x27;Tis</p>
<p>Voltaire&#x27;s fault, &#x27;tis Rousseau&#x27;s fault.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tiens! perhaps he is one of the chorus at the Opera,&quot; said Amaury.</p>
<p>This exasperated Oscar, who bounded up, pulled out the wooden &quot;back,&quot;</p>
<p>and called to Pierrotin:--</p>
<p>&quot;When do we start?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Presently,&quot; said that functionary, who was standing, whip in hand,</p>
<p>and gazing toward the rue d&#x27;Enghien.</p>
<p>At this moment the scene was enlivened by the arrival of a young man</p>
<p>accompanied by a true &quot;gamin,&quot; who was followed by a porter dragging a</p>
<p>hand-cart. The young man came up to Pierrotin and spoke to him</p>
<p>confidentially, on which the latter nodded his head, and called to his</p>
<p>own porter. The man ran out and helped to unload the little hand-cart,</p>
<p>which contained, besides two trunks, buckets, brushes, boxes of</p>
<p>singular shape, and an infinity of packages and utensils which the</p>
<p>youngest of the new-comers, who had climbed into the imperial, stowed</p>
<p>away with such celerity that Oscar, who happened to be smiling at his</p>
<p>mother, now standing on the other side of the street, saw none of the</p>
<p>paraphernalia which might have revealed to him the profession of his</p>
<p>new travelling companion.</p>
<p>The gamin, who must have been sixteen years of age, wore a gray blouse</p>
<p>buckled round his waist by a polished leather belt. His cap, jauntily</p>
<p>perched on the side of his head, seemed the sign of a merry nature,</p>
<p>and so did the picturesque disorder of the curly brown hair which fell</p>
<p>upon his shoulders. A black-silk cravat drew a line round his very</p>
<p>white neck, and added to the vivacity of his bright gray eyes. The</p>
<p>animation of his brown and rosy face, the moulding of his rather large</p>
<p>lips, the ears detached from his head, his slightly turned-up nose,--</p>
<p>in fact, all the details of his face proclaimed the lively spirit of a</p>
<p>Figaro, and the careless gayety of youth, while the vivacity of his</p>
<p>gesture and his mocking eye revealed an intellect already developed by</p>
<p>the practice of a profession adopted very early in life. As he had</p>
<p>already some claims to personal value, this child, made man by Art or</p>
<p>by vocation, seemed indifferent to the question of costume; for he</p>
<p>looked at his boots, which had not been polished, with a quizzical</p>
<p>air, and searched for the spots on his brown Holland trousers less to</p>
<p>remove them than to see their effect.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m in style,&quot; he said, giving himself a shake and addressing his</p>
<p>companion.</p>
<p>The glance of the latter, showed authority over his adept, in whom a</p>
<p>practised eye would at once have recognized the joyous pupil of a</p>
<p>painter, called in the argot of the studios a &quot;rapin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Behave yourself, Mistigris,&quot; said his master, giving him the nickname</p>
<p>which the studio had no doubt bestowed upon him.</p>
<p>The master was a slight and pale young man, with extremely thick black</p>
<p>hair, worn in a disorder that was actually fantastic. But this</p>
<p>abundant mass of hair seemed necessary to an enormous head, whose vast</p>
<p>forehead proclaimed a precocious intellect. A strained and harassed</p>
<p>face, too original to be ugly, was hollowed as if this noticeable</p>
<p>young man suffered from some chronic malady, or from privations caused</p>
<p>by poverty (the most terrible of all chronic maladies), or from griefs</p>
<p>too recent to be forgotten. His clothing, analogous, with due</p>
<p>allowance, to that of Mistigris, consisted of a shabby surtout coat,</p>
<p>American-green in color, much worn, but clean and well-brushed; a</p>
<p>black waistcoat buttoned to the throat, which almost concealed a</p>
<p>scarlet neckerchief; and trousers, also black and even more worn than</p>
<p>the coat, flapping his thin legs. In addition, a pair of very muddy</p>
<p>boots indicated that he had come on foot and from some distance to the</p>
<p>coach office. With a rapid look this artist seized the whole scene of</p>
<p>the Lion d&#x27;Argent, the stables, the courtyard, the various lights and</p>
<p>shades, and the details; then he looked at Mistigris, whose satirical</p>
<p>glance had followed his own.</p>
<p>&quot;Charming!&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, very,&quot; replied the other.</p>
<p>&quot;We seem to have got here too early,&quot; pursued Mistigris. &quot;Couldn&#x27;t we</p>
<p>get a mouthful somewhere? My stomach, like Nature, abhors a vacuum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have we time to get a cup of coffee?&quot; said the artist, in a gentle</p>
<p>voice, to Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but don&#x27;t be long,&quot; answered the latter.</p>
<p>&quot;Good; that means we have a quarter of an hour,&quot; remarked Mistigris,</p>
<p>with the innate genius for observation of the Paris rapin.</p>
<p>The pair disappeared. Nine o&#x27;clock was striking in the hotel kitchen.</p>
<p>Georges thought it just and reasonable to remonstrate with Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! my friend; when a man is blessed with such wheels as these</p>
<p>(striking the clumsy tires with his cane) he ought at least to have</p>
<p>the merit of punctuality. The deuce! one doesn&#x27;t get into that thing</p>
<p>for pleasure; I have business that is devilishly pressing or I</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t trust my bones to it. And that horse, which you call Rougeot,</p>
<p>he doesn&#x27;t look likely to make up for lost time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to harness Bichette while those gentlemen take their</p>
<p>coffee,&quot; replied Pierrotin. &quot;Go and ask, you,&quot; he said to his porter,</p>
<p>&quot;if Pere Leger is coming with us--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is your Pere Leger?&quot; asked Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the way, at number 50. He couldn&#x27;t get a place in the Beaumont</p>
<p>diligence,&quot; said Pierrotin, still speaking to his porter and</p>
<p>apparently making no answer to his customer; then he disappeared</p>
<p>himself in search of Bichette.</p>
<p>Georges, after shaking hands with his friend, got into the coach,</p>
<p>handling with an air of great importance a portfolio which he placed</p>
<p>beneath the cushion of the seat. He took the opposite corner to that</p>
<p>of Oscar, on the same seat.</p>
<p>&quot;This Pere Leger troubles me,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They can&#x27;t take away our places,&quot; replied Oscar. &quot;I have number one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I number two,&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>Just as Pierrotin reappeared, having harnessed Bichette, the porter</p>
<p>returned with a stout man in tow, whose weight could not have been</p>
<p>less than two hundred and fifty pounds at the very least. Pere Leger</p>
<p>belonged to the species of farmer which has a square back, a</p>
<p>protuberant stomach, a powdered pigtail, and wears a little coat of</p>
<p>blue linen. His white gaiters, coming above the knee, were fastened</p>
<p>round the ends of his velveteen breeches and secured by silver</p>
<p>buckles. His hob-nailed shoes weighed two pounds each. In his hand, he</p>
<p>held a small reddish stick, much polished, with a large knob, which</p>
<p>was fastened round his wrist by a thong of leather.</p>
<p>&quot;And you are called Pere Leger?&quot; asked Georges, very seriously, as the</p>
<p>farmer attempted to put a foot on the step.</p>
<p>&quot;At your service,&quot; replied the farmer, looking in and showing a face</p>
<p>like that of Louis XVIII., with fat, rubicund cheeks, from between</p>
<p>which issued a nose that in any other face would have seemed enormous.</p>
<p>His smiling eyes were sunken in rolls of fat. &quot;Come, a helping hand,</p>
<p>my lad!&quot; he said to Pierrotin.</p>
<p>The farmer was hoisted in by the united efforts of Pierrotin and the</p>
<p>porter, to cries of &quot;Houp la! hi! ha! hoist!&quot; uttered by Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! I&#x27;m not going far; only to La Cave,&quot; said the farmer, good-</p>
<p>humoredly.</p>
<p>In France everybody takes a joke.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the back seat,&quot; said Pierrotin, &quot;there&#x27;ll be six of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where&#x27;s your other horse?&quot; demanded Georges. &quot;Is it as mythical as</p>
<p>the third post-horse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There she is,&quot; said Pierrotin, pointing to the little mare, who was</p>
<p>coming along alone.</p>
<p>&quot;He calls that insect a horse!&quot; exclaimed Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! she&#x27;s good, that little mare,&quot; said the farmer, who by this time</p>
<p>was seated. &quot;Your servant, gentlemen. Well, Pierrotin, how soon do you</p>
<p>start?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have two travellers in there after a cup of coffee,&quot; replied</p>
<p>Pierrotin.</p>
<p>The hollow-cheeked young man and his page reappeared.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, let&#x27;s start!&quot; was the general cry.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to start,&quot; replied Pierrotin. &quot;Now, then, make ready,&quot;</p>
<p>he said to the porter, who began thereupon to take away the stones</p>
<p>which stopped the wheels.</p>
<p>Pierrotin took Rougeot by the bridle and gave that guttural cry, &quot;Ket,</p>
<p>ket!&quot; to tell the two animals to collect their energy; on which,</p>
<p>though evidently stiff, they pulled the coach to the door of the Lion</p>
<p>d&#x27;Argent. After which manoeuvre, which was purely preparatory,</p>
<p>Pierrotin gazed up the rue d&#x27;Enghien and then disappeared, leaving the</p>
<p>coach in charge of the porter.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah ca! is he subject to such attacks,--that master of yours?&quot; said</p>
<p>Mistigris, addressing the porter.</p>
<p>&quot;He has gone to fetch his feed from the stable,&quot; replied the porter,</p>
<p>well versed in all the usual tricks to keep passengers quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, after all,&quot; said Mistigris, &quot;&#x27;art is long, but life is short&#x27;</p>
<p>--to Bichette.&quot;</p>
<p>At this particular epoch, a fancy for mutilating or transposing</p>
<p>proverbs reigned in the studios. It was thought a triumph to find</p>
<p>changes of letters, and sometimes of words, which still kept the</p>
<p>semblance of the proverb while giving it a fantastic or ridiculous</p>
<p>meaning.[*]</p>
<p>[*] It is plainly impossible to translate many of these proverbs and</p>
<p>put any fun or meaning into them.--Tr.</p>
<p>&quot;Patience, Mistigris!&quot; said his master; &quot;&#x27;come wheel, come whoa.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Pierrotin here returned, bringing with him the Comte de Serizy, who</p>
<p>had come through the rue de l&#x27;Echiquier, and with whom he had</p>
<p>doubtless had a short conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;Pere Leger,&quot; said Pierrotin, looking into the coach, &quot;will you give</p>
<p>your place to Monsieur le comte? That will balance the carriage</p>
<p>better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We sha&#x27;n&#x27;t be off for an hour if you go on this way,&quot; cried Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall have to take down this infernal bar, which cost such trouble</p>
<p>to put up. Why should everybody be made to move for the man who comes</p>
<p>last? We all have a right to the places we took. What place has</p>
<p>monsieur engaged? Come, find that out! Haven&#x27;t you a way-book, a</p>
<p>register, or something? What place has Monsieur Lecomte engaged?--</p>
<p>count of what, I&#x27;d like to know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur le comte,&quot; said Pierrotin, visibly troubled, &quot;I am afraid</p>
<p>you will be uncomfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you keep better count of us?&quot; said Mistigris. &quot;&#x27;Short</p>
<p>counts make good ends.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mistigris, behave yourself,&quot; said his master.</p>
<p>Monsieur de Serizy was evidently taken by all the persons in the coach</p>
<p>for a bourgeois of the name of Lecomte.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t disturb any one,&quot; he said to Pierrotin. &quot;I will sit with you in</p>
<p>front.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come, Mistigris,&quot; said the master to his rapin, &quot;remember the respect</p>
<p>you owe to age; you don&#x27;t know how shockingly old you may be yourself</p>
<p>some day. &#x27;Travel deforms youth.&#x27; Give your place to monsieur.&quot;</p>
<p>Mistigris opened the leathern curtain and jumped out with the agility</p>
<p>of a frog leaping into the water.</p>
<p>&quot;You mustn&#x27;t be a rabbit, august old man,&quot; he said to the count.</p>
<p>&quot;Mistigris, &#x27;ars est celare bonum,&#x27;&quot; said his master.</p>
<p>&quot;I thank you very much, monsieur,&quot; said the count to Mistigris&#x27;s</p>
<p>master, next to whom he now sat.</p>
<p>The minister of State cast a sagacious glance round the interior of</p>
<p>the coach, which greatly affronted both Oscar and Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;When persons want to be master of a coach, they should engage all the</p>
<p>places,&quot; remarked Georges.</p>
<p>Certain now of his incognito, the Comte de Serizy made no reply to</p>
<p>this observation, but assumed the air of a good-natured bourgeois.</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose you were late, wouldn&#x27;t you be glad that the coach waited for</p>
<p>you?&quot; said the farmer to the two young men.</p>
<p>Pierrotin still looked up and down the street, whip in hand,</p>
<p>apparently reluctant to mount to the hard seat where Mistigris was</p>
<p>fidgeting.</p>
<p>&quot;If you expect some one else, I am not the last,&quot; said the count.</p>
<p>&quot;I agree to that reasoning,&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>Georges and Oscar began to laugh impertinently.</p>
<p>&quot;The old fellow doesn&#x27;t know much,&quot; whispered Georges to Oscar, who</p>
<p>was delighted at this apparent union between himself and the object of</p>
<p>his envy.</p>
<p>&quot;Parbleu!&quot; cried Pierrotin, &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t be sorry for two more</p>
<p>passengers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#x27;t paid; I&#x27;ll get out,&quot; said Georges, alarmed.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you waiting for, Pierrotin?&quot; asked Pere Leger.</p>
<p>Whereupon Pierrotin shouted a certain &quot;Hi!&quot; in which Bichette and</p>
<p>Rougeot recognized a definitive resolution, and they both sprang</p>
<p>toward the rise of the faubourg at a pace which was soon to slacken.</p>
<p>The count had a red face, of a burning red all over, on which were</p>
<p>certain inflamed portions which his snow-white hair brought out into</p>
<p>full relief. To any but heedless youths, this complexion would have</p>
<p>revealed a constant inflammation of the blood, produced by incessant</p>
<p>labor. These blotches and pimples so injured the naturally noble air</p>
<p>of the count that careful examination was needed to find in his green-</p>
<p>gray eyes the shrewdness of the magistrate, the wisdom of a statesman,</p>
<p>and the knowledge of a legislator. His face was flat, and the nose</p>
<p>seemed to have been depressed into it. The hat hid the grace and</p>
<p>beauty of his forehead. In short, there was enough to amuse those</p>
<p>thoughtless youths in the odd contrasts of the silvery hair, the</p>
<p>burning face, and the thick, tufted eye-brows which were still jet-</p>
<p>black.</p>
<p>The count wore a long blue overcoat, buttoned in military fashion to</p>
<p>the throat, a white cravat around his neck, cotton wool in his ears,</p>
<p>and a shirt-collar high enough to make a large square patch of white</p>
<p>on each cheek. His black trousers covered his boots, the toes of</p>
<p>which were barely seen. He wore no decoration in his button-hole, and</p>
<p>doeskin gloves concealed his hands. Nothing about him betrayed to the</p>
<p>eyes of youth a peer of France, and one of the most useful statesmen</p>
<p>in the kingdom.</p>
<p>Pere Leger had never seen the count, who, on his side, knew the former</p>
<p>only by name. When the count, as he got into the carriage, cast the</p>
<p>glance about him which affronted Georges and Oscar, he was, in</p>
<p>reality, looking for the head-clerk of his notary (in case he had been</p>
<p>forced, like himself, to take Pierrotin&#x27;s vehicle), intending to</p>
<p>caution him instantly about his own incognito. But feeling reassured</p>
<p>by the appearance of Oscar, and that of Pere Leger, and, above all, by</p>
<p>the quasi-military air, the waxed moustaches, and the general look of</p>
<p>an adventurer that distinguished Georges, he concluded that his note</p>
<p>had reached his notary, Alexandre Crottat, in time to prevent the</p>
<p>departure of the clerk.</p>
<p>&quot;Pere Leger,&quot; said Pierrotin, when they reached the steep hill of the</p>
<p>faubourg Saint-Denis by the rue de la Fidelite, &quot;suppose we get out,</p>
<p>hey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll get out, too,&quot; said the count, hearing Leger&#x27;s name.</p>
<p>&quot;Goodness! if this is how we are going, we shall do fourteen miles in</p>
<p>fifteen days!&quot; cried Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;It isn&#x27;t my fault,&quot; said Pierrotin, &quot;if a passenger wishes to get</p>
<p>out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ten louis for you if you keep the secret of my being here as I told</p>
<p>you before,&quot; said the count in a low voice, taking Pierrotin by the</p>
<p>arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, my thousand francs!&quot; thought Pierrotin as he winked an eye at</p>
<p>Monsieur de Serizy, which meant, &quot;Rely on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar and Georges stayed in the coach.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Pierrotin, since Pierrotin you are,&quot; cried Georges, when</p>
<p>the passengers were once more stowed away in the vehicle, &quot;if you</p>
<p>don&#x27;t mean to go faster than this, say so! I&#x27;ll pay my fare and take a</p>
<p>post-horse at Saint-Denis, for I have important business on hand which</p>
<p>can&#x27;t be delayed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! he&#x27;ll go well enough,&quot; said Pere Leger. &quot;Besides, the distance</p>
<p>isn&#x27;t great.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am never more than half an hour late,&quot; asserted Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you are not wheeling the Pope in this old barrow of yours,&quot;</p>
<p>said Georges, &quot;so, get on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps he&#x27;s afraid of shaking monsieur,&quot; said Mistigris looking</p>
<p>round at the count. &quot;But you shouldn&#x27;t have preferences, Pierrotin, it</p>
<p>isn&#x27;t right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coucous and the Charter make all Frenchmen equals,&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! be easy,&quot; said Pere Leger; &quot;we are sure to get to La Chapelle by</p>
<p>mid-day,&quot;--La Chapelle being the village next beyond the Barriere of</p>
<p>Saint-Denis.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>THE GRANDSON OF THE FAMOUS CZERNI-GEORGES</p>
<p>Those who travel in public conveyances know that the persons thus</p>
<p>united by chance do not immediately have anything to say to one</p>
<p>another; unless under special circumstances, conversation rarely</p>
<p>begins until they have gone some distance. This period of silence is</p>
<p>employed as much in mutual examination as in settling into their</p>
<p>places. Minds need to get their equilibrium as much as bodies. When</p>
<p>each person thinks he has discovered the age, profession, and</p>
<p>character of his companions, the most talkative member of the company</p>
<p>begins, and the conversation gets under way with all the more vivacity</p>
<p>because those present feel a need of enlivening the journey and</p>
<p>forgetting its tedium.</p>
<p>That is how things happen in French stage-coaches. In other countries</p>
<p>customs are very different. Englishmen pique themselves on never</p>
<p>opening their lips; Germans are melancholy in a vehicle; Italians too</p>
<p>wary to talk; Spaniards have no public conveyances; and Russians no</p>
<p>roads. There is no amusement except in the lumbering diligences of</p>
<p>France, that gabbling and indiscreet country, where every one is in a</p>
<p>hurry to laugh and show his wit, and where jest and epigram enliven</p>
<p>all things, even the poverty of the lower classes and the weightier</p>
<p>cares of the solid bourgeois. In a coach there is no police to check</p>
<p>tongues, and legislative assemblies have set the fashion of public</p>
<p>discussion. When a young man of twenty-two, like the one named</p>
<p>Georges, is clever and lively, he is much tempted, especially under</p>
<p>circumstances like the present, to abuse those qualities.</p>
<p>In the first place, Georges had soon decided that he was the superior</p>
<p>human being of the party there assembled. He saw in the count a</p>
<p>manufacturer of the second-class, whom he took, for some unknown</p>
<p>reason, to be a chandler; in the shabby young man accompanied by</p>
<p>Mistigris, a fellow of no account; in Oscar a ninny, and in Pere</p>
<p>Leger, the fat farmer, an excellent subject to hoax. Having thus</p>
<p>looked over the ground, he resolved to amuse himself at the expense of</p>
<p>such companions.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me see,&quot; he thought to himself, as the coucou went down the hill</p>
<p>from La Chapelle to the plain of Saint-Denis, &quot;shall I pass myself off</p>
<p>for Etienne or Beranger? No, these idiots don&#x27;t know who they are.</p>
<p>Carbonaro? the deuce! I might get myself arrested. Suppose I say I&#x27;m</p>
<p>the son of Marshal Ney? Pooh! what could I tell them?--about the</p>
<p>execution of my father? It wouldn&#x27;t be funny. Better be a disguised</p>
<p>Russian prince and make them swallow a lot of stuff about the Emperor</p>
<p>Alexander. Or I might be Cousin, and talk philosophy; oh, couldn&#x27;t I</p>
<p>perplex &#x27;em! But no, that shabby fellow with the tousled head looks to</p>
<p>me as if he had jogged his way through the Sorbonne. What a pity! I</p>
<p>can mimic an Englishman so perfectly I might have pretended to be Lord</p>
<p>Byron, travelling incognito. Sapristi! I&#x27;ll command the troops of Ali,</p>
<p>pacha of Janina!&quot;</p>
<p>During this mental monologue, the coucou rolled through clouds of dust</p>
<p>rising on either side of it from that much travelled road.</p>
<p>&quot;What dust!&quot; cried Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Henry IV. is dead!&quot; retorted his master. &quot;If you&#x27;d say it was scented</p>
<p>with vanilla that would be emitting a new opinion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You think you&#x27;re witty,&quot; replied Mistigris. &quot;Well, it IS like vanilla</p>
<p>at times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the Levant--&quot; said Georges, with the air of beginning a story.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Ex Oriente flux,&#x27;&quot; remarked Mistigris&#x27;s master, interrupting the</p>
<p>speaker.</p>
<p>&quot;I said in the Levant, from which I have just returned,&quot; continued</p>
<p>Georges, &quot;the dust smells very good; but here it smells of nothing,</p>
<p>except in some old dust-barrel like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has monsieur lately returned from the Levant?&quot; said Mistigris,</p>
<p>maliciously. &quot;He isn&#x27;t much tanned by the sun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! I&#x27;ve just left my bed after an illness of three months, from the</p>
<p>germ, so the doctors said, of suppressed plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you had the plague?&quot; cried the count, with a gesture of alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;Pierrotin, stop!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go on, Pierrotin,&quot; said Mistigris. &quot;Didn&#x27;t you hear him say it was</p>
<p>inward, his plague?&quot; added the rapin, talking back to Monsieur de</p>
<p>Serizy. &quot;It isn&#x27;t catching; it only comes out in conversation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mistigris! if you interfere again I&#x27;ll have you put off into the</p>
<p>road,&quot; said his master. &quot;And so,&quot; he added, turning to Georges,</p>
<p>&quot;monsieur has been to the East?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, monsieur; first to Egypt, then to Greece, where I served under</p>
<p>Ali, pacha of Janina, with whom I had a terrible quarrel. There&#x27;s no</p>
<p>enduring those climates long; besides, the emotions of all kinds in</p>
<p>Oriental life have disorganized my liver.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, have you served as a soldier?&quot; asked the fat farmer. &quot;How old</p>
<p>are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty-nine,&quot; replied Georges, whereupon all the passengers looked at</p>
<p>him. &quot;At eighteen I enlisted as a private for the famous campaign of</p>
<p>1813; but I was present at only one battle, that of Hanau, where I was</p>
<p>promoted sergeant-major. In France, at Montereau, I won the rank of</p>
<p>sub-lieutenant, and was decorated by,--there are no informers here,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m sure,--by the Emperor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What! are you decorated?&quot; cried Oscar. &quot;Why don&#x27;t you wear your</p>
<p>cross?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The cross of &#x27;ceux-ci&#x27;? No, thank you! Besides, what man of any</p>
<p>breeding would wear his decorations in travelling? There&#x27;s monsieur,&quot;</p>
<p>he said, motioning to the Comte de Serizy. &quot;I&#x27;ll bet whatever you</p>
<p>like--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Betting whatever you like means, in France, betting nothing at all,&quot;</p>
<p>said Mistigris&#x27;s master.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll bet whatever you like,&quot; repeated Georges, incisively, &quot;that</p>
<p>monsieur here is covered with stars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the count, laughing, &quot;I have the grand cross of the</p>
<p>Legion of honor, that of Saint Andrew of Russia, that of the Prussian</p>
<p>Eagle, that of the Annunciation of Sardinia, and the Golden Fleece.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beg pardon,&quot; said Mistigris, &quot;are they all in the coucou?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! that brick-colored old fellow goes it strong!&quot; whispered Georges</p>
<p>to Oscar. &quot;What was I saying?--oh! I know. I don&#x27;t deny that I adore</p>
<p>the Emperor--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I served under him,&quot; said the count.</p>
<p>&quot;What a man he was, wasn&#x27;t he?&quot; cried Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;A man to whom I owe many obligations,&quot; replied the count, with a</p>
<p>silly expression that was admirably assumed.</p>
<p>&quot;For all those crosses?&quot; inquired Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;And what quantities of snuff he took!&quot; continued Monsieur de Serizy.</p>
<p>&quot;He carried it loose in his pockets,&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;So I&#x27;ve been told,&quot; remarked Pere Leger with an incredulous look.</p>
<p>&quot;Worse than that; he chewed and smoked,&quot; continued Georges. &quot;I saw him</p>
<p>smoking, in a queer way, too, at Waterloo, when Marshal Soult took him</p>
<p>round the waist and flung him into his carriage, just as he had seized</p>
<p>a musket and was going to charge the English--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were at Waterloo!&quot; cried Oscar, his eyes stretching wide open.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, young man, I did the campaign of 1815. I was a captain at Mont-</p>
<p>Saint-Jean, and I retired to the Loire, after we were all disbanded.</p>
<p>Faith! I was disgusted with France; I couldn&#x27;t stand it. In fact, I</p>
<p>should certainly have got myself arrested; so off I went, with two or</p>
<p>three dashing fellows,--Selves, Besson, and others, who are now in</p>
<p>Egypt,--and we entered the service of pacha Mohammed; a queer sort of</p>
<p>fellow he was, too! Once a tobacco merchant in the bazaars, he is now</p>
<p>on the high-road to be a sovereign prince. You&#x27;ve all seen him in that</p>
<p>picture by Horace Vernet,--&#x27;The Massacre of the Mameluks.&#x27; What a</p>
<p>handsome fellow he was! But I wouldn&#x27;t give up the religion of my</p>
<p>fathers and embrace Islamism; all the more because the abjuration</p>
<p>required a surgical operation which I hadn&#x27;t any fancy for. Besides,</p>
<p>nobody respects a renegade. Now if they had offered me a hundred</p>
<p>thousand francs a year, perhaps--and yet, no! The pacha did give me a</p>
<p>thousand talari as a present.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How much is that?&quot; asked Oscar, who was listening to Georges with all</p>
<p>his ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! not much. A talaro is, as you might say, a five-franc piece. But</p>
<p>faith! I got no compensation for the vices I contracted in that God-</p>
<p>forsaken country, if country it is. I can&#x27;t live now without smoking a</p>
<p>narghile twice a-day, and that&#x27;s very costly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you find Egypt?&quot; asked the count.</p>
<p>&quot;Egypt? Oh! Egypt is all sand,&quot; replied Georges, by no means taken</p>
<p>aback. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing green but the valley of the Nile. Draw a green</p>
<p>line down a sheet of yellow paper, and you have Egypt. But those</p>
<p>Egyptians--fellahs they are called--have an immense advantage over us.</p>
<p>There are no gendarmes in that country. You may go from end to end of</p>
<p>Egypt, and you won&#x27;t see one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I suppose there are a good many Egyptians,&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Not as many as you think for,&quot; replied Georges. &quot;There are many more</p>
<p>Abyssinians, and Giaours, and Vechabites, Bedouins, and Cophs. But all</p>
<p>that kind of animal is very uninteresting, and I was glad enough to</p>
<p>embark on a Genoese polacca which was loading for the Ionian Islands</p>
<p>with gunpowder and munitions for Ali de Tebelen. You know, don&#x27;t you,</p>
<p>that the British sell powder and munitions of war to all the world,--</p>
<p>Turks, Greeks, and the devil, too, if the devil has money? From Zante</p>
<p>we were to skirt the coasts of Greece and tack about, on and off. Now</p>
<p>it happens that my name of Georges is famous in that country. I am,</p>
<p>such as you see me, the grandson of the famous Czerni-Georges who made</p>
<p>war upon the Porte, and, instead of crushing it, as he meant to do,</p>
<p>got crushed himself. His son took refuge in the house of the French</p>
<p>consul at Smyrna, and he afterwards died in Paris, leaving my mother</p>
<p>pregnant with me, his seventh child. Our property was all stolen by</p>
<p>friends of my grandfather; in fact, we were ruined. My mother, who</p>
<p>lived on her diamonds, which she sold one by one, married, in 1799, my</p>
<p>step-father, Monsieur Yung, a purveyor. But my mother is dead, and I</p>
<p>have quarrelled with my step-father, who, between ourselves, is a</p>
<p>blackguard; he is still alive, but I never see him. That&#x27;s why, in</p>
<p>despair, left all to myself, I went off to the wars as a private in</p>
<ol start="1813">
<li>Well, to go back to the time I returned to Greece; you wouldn&#x27;t</li>
</ol>
<p>believe with what joy old Ali Tebelen received the grandson of Czerni-</p>
<p>Georges. Here, of course, I call myself simply Georges. The pacha gave</p>
<p>me a harem--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have had a harem?&quot; said Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Were you a pacha with MANY tails?&quot; asked Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it that you don&#x27;t know,&quot; replied Georges, &quot;that only the</p>
<p>Sultan makes pachas, and that my friend Tebelen (for we were as</p>
<p>friendly as Bourbons) was in rebellion against the Padishah! You know,</p>
<p>or you don&#x27;t know, that the true title of the Grand Seignior is</p>
<p>Padishah, and not Sultan or Grand Turk. You needn&#x27;t think that a harem</p>
<p>is much of a thing; you might as well have a herd of goats. The women</p>
<p>are horribly stupid down there; I much prefer the grisettes of the</p>
<p>Chaumieres at Mont-Parnasse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are nearer, at any rate,&quot; said the count.</p>
<p>&quot;The women of the harem couldn&#x27;t speak a word of French, and that</p>
<p>language is indispensable for talking. Ali gave me five legitimate</p>
<p>wives and ten slaves; that&#x27;s equivalent to having none at all at</p>
<p>Janina. In the East, you must know, it is thought very bad style to</p>
<p>have wives and women. They have them, just as we have Voltaire and</p>
<p>Rousseau; but who ever opens his Voltaire or his Rousseau? Nobody.</p>
<p>But, for all that, the highest style is to be jealous. They sew a</p>
<p>woman up in a sack and fling her into the water on the slightest</p>
<p>suspicion,--that&#x27;s according to their Code.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you fling any in?&quot; asked the farmer.</p>
<p>&quot;I, a Frenchman! for shame! I loved them.&quot;</p>
<p>Whereupon Georges twirled and twisted his moustache with a dreamy air.</p>
<p>They were now entering Saint-Denis, and Pierrotin presently drew up</p>
<p>before the door of a tavern where were sold the famous cheese-cakes of</p>
<p>that place. All the travellers got out. Puzzled by the apparent truth</p>
<p>mingled with Georges&#x27; inventions, the count returned to the coucou</p>
<p>when the others had entered the house, and looked beneath the cushion</p>
<p>for the portfolio which Pierrotin told him that enigmatical youth had</p>
<p>placed there. On it he read the words in gilt letters: &quot;Maitre</p>
<p>Crottat, notary.&quot; The count at once opened it, and fearing, with some</p>
<p>reason, that Pere Leger might be seized with the same curiosity, he</p>
<p>took out the deed of sale for the farm at Moulineaux, put it into his</p>
<p>coat pocket, and entered the inn to keep an eye on the travellers.</p>
<p>&quot;This Georges is neither more nor less than Crottat&#x27;s second clerk,&quot;</p>
<p>thought he. &quot;I shall pay my compliments to his master, whose business</p>
<p>it was to send me his head-clerk.&quot;</p>
<p>From the respectful glances of Pere Leger and Oscar, Georges perceived</p>
<p>that he had made for himself two fervent admirers. Accordingly, he now</p>
<p>posed as a great personage; paid for their cheese-cakes, and ordered</p>
<p>for each a glass of Alicante. He offered the same to Mistigris and his</p>
<p>master, who refused with smiles; but the friend of Ali Tebelen</p>
<p>profited by the occasion to ask the pair their names.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! monsieur,&quot; said Mistigris&#x27; master, &quot;I am not blessed, like you,</p>
<p>with an illustrious name; and I have not returned from Asia--&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment the count, hastening into the huge inn-kitchen lest his</p>
<p>absence should excite inquiry, entered the place in time to hear the</p>
<p>conclusion of the young man&#x27;s speech.</p>
<p>&quot;--I am only a poor painter lately returned from Rome, where I went at</p>
<p>the cost of the government, after winning the &#x27;grand prix&#x27; five years</p>
<p>ago. My name is Schinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! bourgeois, may I offer you a glass of Alicante and some cheese-</p>
<p>cakes?&quot; said Georges to the count.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; replied the latter. &quot;I never leave home without taking my</p>
<p>cup of coffee and cream.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you eat anything between meals? How bourgeois, Marais, Place</p>
<p>Royale, that is!&quot; cried Georges. &quot;When he &#x27;blagued&#x27; just now about his</p>
<p>crosses, I thought there was something in him,&quot; whispered the Eastern</p>
<p>hero to the painter. &quot;However, we&#x27;ll set him going on his decorations,</p>
<p>the old tallow-chandler! Come, my lad,&quot; he added, calling to Oscar,</p>
<p>&quot;drink me down the glass poured out for the chandler; that will start</p>
<p>your moustache.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar, anxious to play the man, swallowed the second glass of wine,</p>
<p>and ate three more cheese-cakes.</p>
<p>&quot;Good wine, that!&quot; said Pere Leger, smacking his lips.</p>
<p>&quot;It is all the better,&quot; said Georges, &quot;because it comes from Bercy.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been to Alicante myself, and I know that this wine no more</p>
<p>resembles what is made there than my arm is like a windmill. Our made-</p>
<p>up wines are a great deal better than the natural ones in their own</p>
<p>country. Come, Pierrotin, take a glass! It is a great pity your horses</p>
<p>can&#x27;t take one, too; we might go faster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forward, march!&quot; cried Pierrotin, amid a mighty cracking of whips,</p>
<p>after the travellers were again boxed up.</p>
<p>It was now eleven o&#x27;clock. The weather, which had been cloudy,</p>
<p>cleared; the breeze swept off the mists, and the blue of the sky</p>
<p>appeared in spots; so that when the coucou trundled along the narrow</p>
<p>strip of road from Saint-Denis to Pierrefitte, the sun had fairly</p>
<p>drunk up the last floating vapors of the diaphanous veil which swathed</p>
<p>the scenery of that famous region.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, now, tell us why you left your friend the pacha,&quot; said Pere</p>
<p>Leger, addressing Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a very singular scamp,&quot; replied Georges, with an air that hid</p>
<p>a multitude of mysteries. &quot;He put me in command of his cavalry,--so</p>
<p>far, so good--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! that&#x27;s why he wears spurs,&quot; thought poor Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;At that time Ali Tebelen wanted to rid himself of Chosrew pacha,</p>
<p>another queer chap! You call him, here, Chaureff; but the name is</p>
<p>pronounced, in Turkish, Cosserew. You must have read in the newspapers</p>
<p>how old Ali drubbed Chosrew, and soundly, too, faith! Well, if it</p>
<p>hadn&#x27;t been for me, Ali Tebelen himself would have bit the dust two</p>
<p>days earlier. I was at the right wing, and I saw Chosrew, an old sly-</p>
<p>boots, thinking to force our centre,--ranks closed, stiff, swift, fine</p>
<p>movement a la Murat. Good! I take my time; then I charge, double-</p>
<p>quick, and cut his line in two,--you understand? Ha! ha! after the</p>
<p>affair was over, Ali kissed me--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do they do that in the East?&quot; asked the count, in a joking way.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, monsieur,&quot; said the painter, &quot;that&#x27;s done all the world over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After that,&quot; continued Georges, &quot;Ali gave me yataghans, and carbines,</p>
<p>and scimetars, and what-not. But when we got back to his capital he</p>
<p>made me propositions, wanted me to drown a wife, and make a slave of</p>
<p>myself,--Orientals are so queer! But I thought I&#x27;d had enough of it;</p>
<p>for, after all, you know, Ali was a rebel against the Porte. So I</p>
<p>concluded I had better get off while I could. But I&#x27;ll do Monsieur</p>
<p>Tebelen the justice to say that he loaded me with presents,--diamonds,</p>
<p>ten thousand talari, one thousand gold coins, a beautiful Greek girl</p>
<p>for groom, a little Circassian for a mistress, and an Arab horse! Yes,</p>
<p>Ali Tebelen, pacha of Janina, is too little known; he needs an</p>
<p>historian. It is only in the East one meets with such iron souls, who</p>
<p>can nurse a vengeance twenty years and accomplish it some fine</p>
<p>morning. He had the most magnificent white beard that was ever seen,</p>
<p>and a hard, stern face--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what did you do with your treasures?&quot; asked farmer Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! that&#x27;s it! you may well ask that! Those fellows down there</p>
<p>haven&#x27;t any Grand Livre nor any Bank of France. So I was forced to</p>
<p>carry off my windfalls in a felucca, which was captured by the Turkish</p>
<p>High-Admiral himself. Such as you see me here to-day, I came very near</p>
<p>being impaled at Smyrna. Indeed, if it hadn&#x27;t been for Monsieur de</p>
<p>Riviere, our ambassador, who was there, they&#x27;d have taken me for an</p>
<p>accomplice of Ali pacha. I saved my head, but, to tell the honest</p>
<p>truth, all the rest, the ten thousand talari, the thousand gold</p>
<p>pieces, and the fine weapons, were all, yes all, drunk up by the</p>
<p>thirsty treasury of the Turkish admiral. My position was the more</p>
<p>perilous because that very admiral happened to be Chosrew pacha. After</p>
<p>I routed him, the fellow had managed to obtain a position which is</p>
<p>equal to that of our Admiral of the Fleet--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I thought he was in the cavalry?&quot; said Pere Leger, who had</p>
<p>followed the narrative with the deepest attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me! how little the East is understood in the French provinces!&quot;</p>
<p>cried Georges. &quot;Monsieur, I&#x27;ll explain the Turks to you. You are a</p>
<p>farmer; the Padishah (that&#x27;s the Sultan) makes you a marshal; if you</p>
<p>don&#x27;t fulfil your functions to his satisfaction, so much the worse for</p>
<p>you, he cuts your head off; that&#x27;s his way of dismissing his</p>
<p>functionaries. A gardener is made a prefect; and the prime minister</p>
<p>comes down to be a foot-boy. The Ottomans have no system of promotion</p>
<p>and no hierarchy. From a cavalry officer Chosrew simply became a naval</p>
<p>officer. Sultan Mahmoud ordered him to capture Ali by sea; and he did</p>
<p>get hold of him, assisted by those beggarly English--who put their paw</p>
<p>on most of the treasure. This Chosrew, who had not forgotten the</p>
<p>riding-lesson I gave him, recognized me. You understand, my goose was</p>
<p>cooked, oh, brown! when it suddenly came into my head to claim</p>
<p>protection as a Frenchman and a troubadour from Monsieur de Riviere.</p>
<p>The ambassador, enchanted to find something to show him off, demanded</p>
<p>that I should be set at liberty. The Turks have one good trait in</p>
<p>their nature; they are as willing to let you go as they are to cut</p>
<p>your head off; they are indifferent to everything. The French consul,</p>
<p>charming fellow, friend of Chosrew, made him give back two thousand of</p>
<p>the talari, and, consequently, his name is, as I may say, graven on my</p>
<p>heart--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was his name?&quot; asked Monsieur de Serizy; and a look of some</p>
<p>surprise passed over his face as Georges named, correctly, one of our</p>
<p>most distinguished consul-generals who happened at that time to be</p>
<p>stationed at Smyrna.</p>
<p>&quot;I assisted,&quot; added Georges, &quot;at the execution of the Governor of</p>
<p>Smyrna, whom the Sultan had ordered Chosrew to put to death. It was</p>
<p>one of the most curious things I ever saw, though I&#x27;ve seen many,--</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell you about it when we stop for breakfast. From Smyrna I</p>
<p>crossed to Spain, hearing there was a revolution there. I went</p>
<p>straight to Mina, who appointed me as his aide-de-camp with the rank</p>
<p>of colonel. I fought for the constitutional cause, which will</p>
<p>certainly be defeated when we enter Spain--as we undoubtedly shall,</p>
<p>some of these days--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You, a French soldier!&quot; said the count, sternly. &quot;You show</p>
<p>extraordinary confidence in the discretion of those who are listening</p>
<p>to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But there are no spies here,&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you aware, Colonel Georges,&quot; continued the count, &quot;that the Court</p>
<p>of Peers is at this very time inquiring into a conspiracy which has</p>
<p>made the government extremely severe in its treatment of French</p>
<p>soldiers who bear arms against France, and who deal in foreign</p>
<p>intrigues for the purpose of overthrowing our legitimate sovereigns.&quot;</p>
<p>On hearing this stern admonition the painter turned red to his ears</p>
<p>and looked at Mistigris, who seemed dumfounded.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Pere Leger, &quot;what next?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If,&quot; continued the count, &quot;I were a magistrate, it would be my duty</p>
<p>to order the gendarmes at Pierrefitte to arrest the aide-de-camp of</p>
<p>Mina, and to summon all present in this vehicle to testify to his</p>
<p>words.&quot;</p>
<p>This speech stopped Georges&#x27; narrative all the more surely, because at</p>
<p>this moment the coucou reached the guard-house of a brigade of</p>
<p>gendarmerie,--the white flag floating, as the orthodox saying is, upon</p>
<p>the breeze.</p>
<p>&quot;You have too many decorations to do such a dastardly thing,&quot; said</p>
<p>Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind; we&#x27;ll catch up with him soon,&quot; whispered Georges in the</p>
<p>lad&#x27;s ear.</p>
<p>&quot;Colonel,&quot; cried Leger, who was a good deal disturbed by the count&#x27;s</p>
<p>outburst, and wanted to change the conversation, &quot;in all these</p>
<p>countries where you have been, what sort of farming do they do? How do</p>
<p>they vary the crops?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, in the first place, my good fellow, you must understand, they</p>
<p>are too busy cropping off each others&#x27; heads to think much of cropping</p>
<p>the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>The count couldn&#x27;t help smiling; and that smile reassured the</p>
<p>narrator.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a way of cultivating which you will think very queer. They</p>
<p>don&#x27;t cultivate at all; that&#x27;s their style of farming. The Turks and</p>
<p>the Greeks, they eat onions or rise. They get opium from poppies, and</p>
<p>it gives them a fine revenue. Then they have tobacco, which grows of</p>
<p>itself, famous latakiah! and dates! and all kinds of sweet things that</p>
<p>don&#x27;t need cultivation. It is a country full of resources and</p>
<p>commerce. They make fine rugs at Smyrna, and not dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; persisted Leger, &quot;if the rugs are made of wool they must come</p>
<p>from sheep; and to have sheep you must have fields, farms, culture--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there may be something of that sort,&quot; replied Georges. &quot;But</p>
<p>their chief crop, rice, grows in the water. As for me, I have only</p>
<p>been along the coasts and seen the parts that are devastated by war.</p>
<p>Besides, I have the deepest aversion to statistics.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about the taxes?&quot; asked the farmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! the taxes are heavy; they take all a man has, and leave him the</p>
<p>rest. The pacha of Egypt was so struck with the advantages of that</p>
<p>system, that, when I came away he was on the point of organizing his</p>
<p>own administration on that footing--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; said Leger, who no longer understood a single word, &quot;how?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot; said Georges. &quot;Why, agents go round and take all the harvests,</p>
<p>and leave the fellahs just enough to live on. That&#x27;s a system that</p>
<p>does away with stamped papers and bureaucracy, the curse of France,</p>
<p>hein?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By virtue of what right?&quot; said Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;Right? why it is a land of despotism. They haven&#x27;t any rights. Don&#x27;t</p>
<p>you know the fine definition Montesquieu gives of despotism. &#x27;Like the</p>
<p>savage, it cuts down the tree to gather the fruits.&#x27; They don&#x27;t tax,</p>
<p>they take everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#x27;s what our rulers are trying to bring us to. &#x27;Tax vobiscum,&#x27;</p>
<p>--no, thank you!&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;But that is what we ARE coming to,&quot; said the count. &quot;Therefore, those</p>
<p>who own land will do well to sell it. Monsieur Schinner must have seen</p>
<p>how things are tending in Italy, where the taxes are enormous.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Corpo di Bacco! the Pope is laying it on heavily,&quot; replied Schinner.</p>
<p>&quot;But the people are used to it. Besides, Italians are so good-natured</p>
<p>that if you let &#x27;em murder a few travellers along the highways they&#x27;re</p>
<p>contented.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see, Monsieur Schinner,&quot; said the count, &quot;that you are not wearing</p>
<p>the decoration you obtained in 1819; it seems the fashion nowadays not</p>
<p>to wear orders.&quot;</p>
<p>Mistigris and the pretended Schinner blushed to their ears.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, with me,&quot; said the artist, &quot;the case is different. It isn&#x27;t on</p>
<p>account of fashion; but I don&#x27;t want to be recognized. Have the</p>
<p>goodness not to betray me, monsieur; I am supposed to be a little</p>
<p>painter of no consequence,--a mere decorator. I&#x27;m on may way to a</p>
<p>chateau where I mustn&#x27;t rouse the slightest suspicion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! I see,&quot; said the count, &quot;some intrigue,--a love affair! Youth is</p>
<p>happy!&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar, who was writhing in his skin at being a nobody and having</p>
<p>nothing to say, gazed at Colonel Czerni-Georges and at the famous</p>
<p>painter Schinner, and wondered how he could transform himself into</p>
<p>somebody. But a youth of nineteen, kept at home all his life, and</p>
<p>going for two weeks only into the country, what could he be, or do, or</p>
<p>say? However, the Alicante had got into his head, and his vanity was</p>
<p>boiling in his veins; so when the famous Schinner allowed a romantic</p>
<p>adventure to be guessed at in which the danger seemed as great as the</p>
<p>pleasure, he fastened his eyes, sparkling with wrath and envy, upon</p>
<p>that hero.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the count, with a credulous air, &quot;a man must love a woman</p>
<p>well to make such sacrifices.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What sacrifices?&quot; demanded Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you know, my little friend, that a ceiling painted by so great</p>
<p>a master as yours is worth its weight in gold?&quot; replied the count. &quot;If</p>
<p>the civil list paid you, as it did, thirty thousand francs for each of</p>
<p>those rooms in the Louvre,&quot; he continued, addressing Schinner, &quot;a</p>
<p>bourgeois,--as you call us in the studios--ought certainly to pay you</p>
<p>twenty thousand. Whereas, if you go to this chateau as a humble</p>
<p>decorator, you will not get two thousand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The money is not the greatest loss,&quot; said Mistigris. &quot;The work is</p>
<p>sure to be a masterpiece, but he can&#x27;t sign it, you know, for fear of</p>
<p>compromising HER.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! I&#x27;d return all my crosses to the sovereigns who gave them to me</p>
<p>for the devotion that youth can win,&quot; said the count.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s just it!&quot; said Mistigris, &quot;when one&#x27;s young, one&#x27;s loved;</p>
<p>plenty of love, plenty of women; but they do say: &#x27;Where there&#x27;s wife,</p>
<p>there&#x27;s mope.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What does Madame Schinner say to all this?&quot; pursued the count; &quot;for I</p>
<p>believe you married, out of love, the beautiful Adelaide de Rouville,</p>
<p>the protegee of old Admiral de Kergarouet; who, by the bye, obtained</p>
<p>for you the order for the Louvre ceilings through his nephew, the</p>
<p>Comte de Fontaine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A great painter is never married when he travels,&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;So that&#x27;s the morality of studios, is it?&quot; cried the count, with an</p>
<p>air of great simplicity.</p>
<p>&quot;Is the morality of courts where you got those decorations of yours</p>
<p>any better?&quot; said Schinner, recovering his self-possession, upset for</p>
<p>the moment by finding out how much the count knew of Schinner&#x27;s life</p>
<p>as an artist.</p>
<p>&quot;I never asked for any of my orders,&quot; said the count. &quot;I believe I</p>
<p>have loyally earned them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;A fair yield and no flavor,&#x27;&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>The count was resolved not to betray himself; he assumed an air of</p>
<p>good-humored interest in the country, and looked up the valley of</p>
<p>Groslay as the coucou took the road to Saint-Brice, leaving that to</p>
<p>Chantilly on the right.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Rome as fine as they say it is?&quot; said Georges, addressing the</p>
<p>great painter.</p>
<p>&quot;Rome is fine only to those who love it; a man must have a passion for</p>
<p>it to enjoy it. As a city, I prefer Venice,--though I just missed</p>
<p>being murdered there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Faith, yes!&quot; cried Mistigris; &quot;if it hadn&#x27;t been for me you&#x27;d have</p>
<p>been gobbled up. It was that mischief-making tom-fool, Lord Byron, who</p>
<p>got you into the scrape. Oh! wasn&#x27;t he raging, that buffoon of an</p>
<p>Englishman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hush!&quot; said Schinner. &quot;I don&#x27;t want my affair with Lord Byron talked</p>
<p>about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you must own, all the same, that you were glad enough I knew how</p>
<p>to box,&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>From time to time, Pierrotin exchanged sly glances with the count,</p>
<p>which might have made less inexperienced persons than the five other</p>
<p>travellers uneasy.</p>
<p>&quot;Lords, pachas, and thirty-thousand-franc ceilings!&quot; he cried. &quot;I seem</p>
<p>to be driving sovereigns. What pourboires I&#x27;ll get!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And all the places paid for!&quot; said Mistigris, slyly.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a lucky day for me,&quot; continued Pierrotin; &quot;for you know, Pere</p>
<p>Leger, about my beautiful new coach on which I have paid an advance of</p>
<p>two thousand francs? Well, those dogs of carriage-builders, to whom I</p>
<p>have to pay two thousand five hundred francs more, won&#x27;t take fifteen</p>
<p>hundred down, and my note for a thousand for two months! Those</p>
<p>vultures want it all. Who ever heard of being so stiff with a man in</p>
<p>business these eight years, and the father of a family?--making me run</p>
<p>the risk of losing everything, carriage and money too, if I can&#x27;t find</p>
<p>before to-morrow night that miserable last thousand! Hue, Bichette!</p>
<p>They won&#x27;t play that trick on the great coach offices, I&#x27;ll warrant</p>
<p>you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that&#x27;s it,&quot; said the rapin; &quot;&#x27;your money or your strife.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you have only eight hundred now to get,&quot; remarked the count,</p>
<p>who considered this moan, addressed to Pere Leger, a sort of letter of</p>
<p>credit drawn upon himself.</p>
<p>&quot;True,&quot; said Pierrotin. &quot;Xi! xi! Rougeot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must have seen many fine ceilings in Venice,&quot; resumed the count,</p>
<p>addressing Schinner.</p>
<p>&quot;I was too much in love to take any notice of what seemed to me then</p>
<p>mere trifles,&quot; replied Schinner. &quot;But I was soon cured of that folly,</p>
<p>for it was in the Venetian states--in Dalmatia--that I received a</p>
<p>cruel lesson.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can it be told?&quot; asked Georges. &quot;I know Dalmatia very well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if you have been there, you know that all the people at that</p>
<p>end of the Adriatic are pirates, rovers, corsairs retired from</p>
<p>business, as they haven&#x27;t been hanged--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uscoques,&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>Hearing the right name given, the count, who had been sent by Napoleon</p>
<p>on one occasion to the Illyrian provinces, turned his head and looked</p>
<p>at Georges, so surprised was he.</p>
<p>&quot;The affair happened in that town where they make maraschino,&quot;</p>
<p>continued Schinner, seeming to search for a name.</p>
<p>&quot;Zara,&quot; said Georges. &quot;I&#x27;ve been there; it is on the coast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are right,&quot; said the painter. &quot;I had gone there to look at the</p>
<p>country, for I adore scenery. I&#x27;ve longed a score of times to paint</p>
<p>landscape, which no one, as I think, understands but Mistigris, who</p>
<p>will some day reproduce Hobbema, Ruysdael, Claude Lorrain, Poussin,</p>
<p>and others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; exclaimed the count, &quot;if he reproduces one of them won&#x27;t that</p>
<p>be enough?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you persist in interrupting, monsieur,&quot; said Oscar, &quot;we shall</p>
<p>never get on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Monsieur Schinner was not addressing himself to you in</p>
<p>particular,&quot; added Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tisn&#x27;t polite to interrupt,&quot; said Mistigris, sententiously, &quot;but we</p>
<p>all do it, and conversation would lose a great deal if we didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>scatter little condiments while exchanging our reflections. Therefore,</p>
<p>continue, agreeable old gentleman, to lecture us, if you like. It is</p>
<p>done in the best society, and you know the proverb: &#x27;we must &#x27;owl with</p>
<p>the wolves.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had heard marvellous things of Dalmatia,&quot; resumed Schinner, &quot;so I</p>
<p>went there, leaving Mistigris in Venice at an inn--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Locanda,&#x27;&quot; interposed Mistigris; &quot;keep to the local color.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zara is what is called a country town--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Georges; &quot;but it is fortified.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Parbleu!&quot; said Schinner; &quot;the fortifications count for much in my</p>
<p>adventure. At Zara there are a great many apothecaries. I lodged with</p>
<p>one. In foreign countries everybody makes a principal business of</p>
<p>letting lodgings; all other trades are accessory. In the evening,</p>
<p>linen changed, I sat in my balcony. In the opposite balcony I saw a</p>
<p>woman; oh! such a woman! Greek,--THAT TELLS ALL! The most beautiful</p>
<p>creature in the town; almond eyes, lids that dropped like curtains,</p>
<p>lashes like a paint-brush, a face with an oval to drive Raffaelle mad,</p>
<p>a skin of the most delicious coloring, tints well-blended, velvety!</p>
<p>and hands, oh!--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They weren&#x27;t made of butter like those of the David school,&quot; put in</p>
<p>Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;You are always lugging in your painting,&quot; cried Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;La, la!&quot; retorted Mistigris; &quot;&#x27;an ounce o&#x27; paint is worth a pound of</p>
<p>swagger.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And such a costume! pure Greek!&quot; continued Schinner. &quot;Conflagration</p>
<p>of soul! you understand? Well, I questioned my Diafoirus; and he told</p>
<p>me that my neighbor was named Zena. Changed my linen. The husband, an</p>
<p>old villain, in order to marry Zena, paid three hundred thousand</p>
<p>francs to her father and mother, so celebrated was the beauty of that</p>
<p>beautiful creature, who was truly the most beautiful girl in all</p>
<p>Dalmatia, Illyria, Adriatica, and other places. In those parts they</p>
<p>buy their wives without seeing them--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall not go THERE,&quot; said Pere Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;There are nights when my sleep is still illuminated by the eyes of</p>
<p>Zena,&quot; continued Schinner. &quot;The husband was sixty-nine years of age,</p>
<p>and jealous! not as a tiger, for they say of a tiger, &#x27;jealous as a</p>
<p>Dalmatian&#x27;; and my man was worse than A Dalmatian, one Dalmatian,--he</p>
<p>was three and a half Dalmatians at the very least; he was an Uscoque,</p>
<p>tricoque, archicoque in a bicoque of a paltry little place like</p>
<p>Zara--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Horrid fellow, and &#x27;horrider bellow,&#x27;&quot; put in Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! good,&quot; said Georges, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;After being a corsair, and probably a pirate, he thought no more of</p>
<p>spitting a Christian on his dagger than I did of spitting on the</p>
<p>ground,&quot; continued Schinner. &quot;So that was how the land lay. The old</p>
<p>wretch had millions, and was hideous with the loss of an ear some</p>
<p>pacha had cut off, and the want of an eye left I don&#x27;t know where.</p>
<p>&#x27;Never,&#x27; said the little Diafoirus, &#x27;never does he leave his wife,</p>
<p>never for a second.&#x27; &#x27;Perhaps she&#x27;ll want your services, and I could</p>
<p>go in your clothes; that&#x27;s a trick that has great success in our</p>
<p>theatres,&#x27; I told him. Well, it would take too long to tell you all</p>
<p>the delicious moments of that lifetime--to wit, three days--which I</p>
<p>passed exchanging looks with Zena, and changing linen every day. It</p>
<p>was all the more violently titillating because the slightest motion</p>
<p>was significant and dangerous. At last it must have dawned upon Zena&#x27;s</p>
<p>mind that none but a Frenchman and an artist was daring enough to make</p>
<p>eyes at her in the midst of the perils by which she was surrounded;</p>
<p>and as she hated her hideous pirate, she answered my glances with</p>
<p>delightful ogles fit to raise a man to the summit of Paradise without</p>
<p>pulleys. I attained to the height of Don Quixote; I rose to</p>
<p>exaltation! and I cried: &#x27;The monster may kill me, but I&#x27;ll go, I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>go!&#x27; I gave up landscape and studied the ignoble dwelling of the</p>
<p>Uscoque. That night, changed linen, and put on the most perfumed shirt</p>
<p>I had; then I crossed the street, and entered--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The house?&quot; cried Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;The house?&quot; echoed Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;The house,&quot; said Schinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you&#x27;re a bold dog,&quot; cried farmer Leger. &quot;I should have kept out</p>
<p>of it myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Especially as you could never have got through the doorway,&quot; replied</p>
<p>Schinner. &quot;So in I went,&quot; he resumed, &quot;and I found two hands stretched</p>
<p>out to meet mine. I said nothing, for those hands, soft as the peel of</p>
<p>an onion, enjoined me to silence. A whisper breathed into my ear, &#x27;He</p>
<p>sleeps!&#x27; Then, as we were sure that nobody would see us, we went to</p>
<p>walk, Zena and I, upon the ramparts, but accompanied, if you please,</p>
<p>by a duenna, as hideous as an old portress, who didn&#x27;t leave us any</p>
<p>more than our shadow; and I couldn&#x27;t persuade Madame Pirate to send</p>
<p>her away. The next night we did the same thing, and again I wanted to</p>
<p>get rid of the old woman, but Zena resisted. As my sweet love spoke</p>
<p>only Greek, and I Venetian, we couldn&#x27;t understand each other, and so</p>
<p>we quarrelled. I said to myself, in changing linen, &#x27;As sure as fate,</p>
<p>the next time there&#x27;ll be no old woman, and we can make it all up with</p>
<p>the language of love.&#x27; Instead of which, fate willed that that old</p>
<p>woman should save my life! You&#x27;ll hear how. The weather was fine, and,</p>
<p>not to create suspicion, I took a turn at landscape,--this was after</p>
<p>our quarrel was made up, you understand. After walking along the</p>
<p>ramparts for some time, I was coming tranquilly home with my hands in</p>
<p>my pockets, when I saw the street crowded with people. Such a crowd!</p>
<p>like that for an execution. It fell upon me; I was seized, garroted,</p>
<p>gagged, and guarded by the police. Ah! you don&#x27;t know--and I hope you</p>
<p>never may know--what it is to be taken for a murderer by a maddened</p>
<p>populace which stones you and howls after you from end to end of the</p>
<p>principal street of a town, shouting for your death! Ah! those eyes</p>
<p>were so many flames, all mouths were a single curse, while from the</p>
<p>volume of that burning hatred rose the fearful cry: &#x27;To death! to</p>
<p>death! down with the murderer!&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So those Dalmatians spoke our language, did they?&quot; said the count. &quot;I</p>
<p>observe you relate the scene as if it happened yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>Schinner was nonplussed.</p>
<p>&quot;Riot has but one language,&quot; said the astute statesman Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued Schinner, &quot;when I was brought into court in presence</p>
<p>of the magistrates, I learned that the cursed corsair was dead,</p>
<p>poisoned by Zena. I&#x27;d liked to have changed linen then. Give you my</p>
<p>word, I knew nothing of THAT melodrama. It seems the Greek girl put</p>
<p>opium (a great many poppies, as monsieur told us, grow about there) in</p>
<p>the pirate&#x27;s grog, just to make him sleep soundly and leave her free</p>
<p>for a little walk with me, and the old duenna, unfortunate creature,</p>
<p>made a mistake and trebled the dose. The immense fortune of that</p>
<p>cursed pirate was really the cause of all my Zena&#x27;s troubles. But she</p>
<p>explained matters so ingenuously that I, for one, was released with an</p>
<p>injunction from the mayor and the Austrian commissary of police to go</p>
<p>back to Rome. Zena, who let the heirs of the Uscoque and the judges</p>
<p>get most of the old villain&#x27;s wealth, was let off with two years&#x27;</p>
<p>seclusion in a convent, where she still is. I am going back there some</p>
<p>day to paint her portrait; for in a few years, you know, all this will</p>
<p>be forgotten. Such are the follies one commits at eighteen!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you left me without a sou in the locanda at Venice,&quot; said</p>
<p>Mistigris. &quot;And I had to get from Venice to Rome by painting portraits</p>
<p>for five francs apiece, which they didn&#x27;t pay me. However, that was my</p>
<p>halcyon time. I don&#x27;t regret it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can imagine the reflections that came to me in that Dalmatian</p>
<p>prison, thrown there without protection, having to answer to Austrians</p>
<p>and Dalmatians, and in danger of losing my head because I went twice</p>
<p>to walk with a woman. There&#x27;s ill-luck, with a vengeance!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did all that really happen to you?&quot; said Oscar, naively.</p>
<p>&quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t it happen to him, inasmuch as it had already happened</p>
<p>during the French occupation of Illyria to one of our most gallant</p>
<p>officers of artillery?&quot; said the count, slyly.</p>
<p>&quot;And you believed that artillery officer?&quot; said Mistigris, as slyly to</p>
<p>the count.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; asked Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course he can&#x27;t tell you that they cut his head off,--how could</p>
<p>he?&quot; said Mistigris. &quot;&#x27;Dead schinners tell no tales.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur, are there farms in that country?&quot; asked Pere Leger. &quot;What</p>
<p>do they cultivate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maraschino,&quot; replied Mistigris,--&quot;a plant that grows to the height of</p>
<p>the lips, and produces a liqueur which goes by that name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Pere Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;I only stayed three days in the town and fifteen in prison,&quot; said</p>
<p>Schinner, &quot;so I saw nothing; not even the fields where they grow the</p>
<p>maraschino.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are fooling you,&quot; said Georges to the farmer. &quot;Maraschino comes</p>
<p>in cases.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Romances alter cases,&#x27;&quot; remarked Mistigris.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>THE DRAMA BEGINS</p>
<p>Pierrotin&#x27;s vehicle was now going down the steep incline of the valley</p>
<p>of Saint-Brice to the inn which stands in the middle of the large</p>
<p>village of that name, where Pierrotin was in the habit of stopping an</p>
<p>hour to breathe his horses, give them their oats, and water them. It</p>
<p>was now about half-past one o&#x27;clock.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! here&#x27;s Pere Leger,&quot; cried the inn-keeper, when the coach pulled</p>
<p>up before the door. &quot;Do you breakfast?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Always once a day,&quot; said the fat farmer; &quot;and I&#x27;ll break a crust here</p>
<p>and now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give us a good breakfast,&quot; cried Georges, twirling his cane in a</p>
<p>cavalier manner which excited the admiration of poor Oscar.</p>
<p>But that admiration was turned to jealousy when he saw the gay</p>
<p>adventurer pull out from a side-pocket a small straw case, from which</p>
<p>he selected a light-colored cigar, which he proceeded to smoke on the</p>
<p>threshold of the inn door while waiting for breakfast.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you smoke?&quot; he asked of Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; replied the ex-schoolboy, swelling out his little chest</p>
<p>and assuming a jaunty air.</p>
<p>Georges presented the open case to Oscar and Schinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Phew!&quot; said the great painter; &quot;ten-sous cigars!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The remains of those I brought back from Spain,&quot; said the adventurer.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you breakfast here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the artist. &quot;I am expected at the chateau. Besides, I took</p>
<p>something at the Lion d&#x27;Argent just before starting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you?&quot; said Georges to Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;I have breakfasted,&quot; replied Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar would have given ten years of his life for boots and straps to</p>
<p>his trousers. He sneezed, he coughed, he spat, and swallowed the smoke</p>
<p>with ill-disguised grimaces.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t know how to smoke,&quot; said Schinner; &quot;look at me!&quot;</p>
<p>With a motionless face Schinner breathed in the smoke of his cigar and</p>
<p>let it out through his nose without the slightest contraction of</p>
<p>feature. Then he took another whiff, kept the smoke in his throat,</p>
<p>removed the cigar from his lips, and allowed the smoke slowly and</p>
<p>gracefully to escape them.</p>
<p>&quot;There, young man,&quot; said the great painter.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, young man, here&#x27;s another way; watch this,&quot; said Georges,</p>
<p>imitating Schinner, but swallowing the smoke and exhaling none.</p>
<p>&quot;And my parents believed they had educated me!&quot; thought Oscar,</p>
<p>endeavoring to smoke with better grace.</p>
<p>But his nausea was so strong that he was thankful when Mistigris</p>
<p>filched his cigar, remarking, as he smoked it with evident</p>
<p>satisfaction, &quot;You haven&#x27;t any contagious diseases, I hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar in reply would fain have punched his head.</p>
<p>&quot;How he does spend money!&quot; he said, looking at Colonel Georges. &quot;Eight</p>
<p>francs for Alicante and the cheese-cakes; forty sous for cigars; and</p>
<p>his breakfast will cost him--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ten francs at least,&quot; replied Mistigris; &quot;but that&#x27;s how things are.</p>
<p>&#x27;Sharp stomachs make short purses.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come, Pere Leger, let us drink a bottle of Bordeaux together,&quot; said</p>
<p>Georges to the farmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty francs for his breakfast!&quot; cried Oscar; &quot;in all, more than</p>
<p>thirty-odd francs since we started!&quot;</p>
<p>Killed by a sense of his inferiority, Oscar sat down on a stone post,</p>
<p>lost in a revery which did not allow him to perceive that his</p>
<p>trousers, drawn up by the effect of his position, showed the point of</p>
<p>junction between the old top of his stocking and the new &quot;footing,&quot;--</p>
<p>his mother&#x27;s handiwork.</p>
<p>&quot;We are brothers in socks,&quot; said Mistigris, pulling up his own</p>
<p>trousers sufficiently to show an effect of the same kind,--&quot;&#x27;By the</p>
<p>footing, Hercules.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>The count, who overheard this, laughed as he stood with folded arms</p>
<p>under the porte-cochere, a little behind the other travellers. However</p>
<p>nonsensical these lads might be, the grave statesman envied their very</p>
<p>follies; he liked their bragging and enjoyed the fun of their lively</p>
<p>chatter.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, are you to have Les Moulineaux? for I know you went to Paris to</p>
<p>get the money for the purchase,&quot; said the inn-keeper to Pere Leger,</p>
<p>whom he had just taken to the stables to see a horse he wanted to sell</p>
<p>to him. &quot;It will be queer if you manage to fleece a peer of France and</p>
<p>a minister of State like the Comte de Serizy.&quot;</p>
<p>The person thus alluded to showed no sign upon his face as he turned</p>
<p>to look at the farmer.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve done for him,&quot; replied Pere Leger, in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Good! I like to see those nobles fooled. If you should want twenty</p>
<p>thousand francs or so, I&#x27;ll lend them to you-- But Francois, the</p>
<p>conductor of Touchard&#x27;s six o&#x27;clock coach, told me that Monsieur</p>
<p>Margueron was invited by the Comte de Serizy to dine with him to-day</p>
<p>at Presles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That was the plan of his Excellency, but we had our own little ways</p>
<p>of thwarting it,&quot; said the farmer, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;The count could appoint Monsieur Margueron&#x27;s son, and you haven&#x27;t any</p>
<p>place to give,--remember that,&quot; said the inn-keeper.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I do; but if the count has the ministry on his side, I have</p>
<p>King Louis XVIII.,&quot; said Pere Leger, in a low voice. &quot;Forty thousand</p>
<p>of his pictures on coin of the realm given to Moreau will enable me to</p>
<p>buy Les Moulineaux for two hundred and sixty thousand, money down,</p>
<p>before Monsieur de Serizy can do so. When he finds the sale is made,</p>
<p>he&#x27;ll be glad enough to buy the farm for three hundred and sixty</p>
<p>thousand, instead of letting me cut it up in small lots right in the</p>
<p>heart of his property.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well done, bourgeois!&quot; cried the inn-keeper.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you think that&#x27;s good play?&quot; said Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides,&quot; said the inn-keeper, &quot;the farm is really worth that to</p>
<p>him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; Les Moulineaux brings in to-day six thousand francs in rental.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll take another lease of it at seven thousand five hundred for</p>
<p>eighteen years. Therefore it is really an investment at more than two</p>
<p>and a half per cent. The count can&#x27;t complain of that. In order not to</p>
<p>involve Moreau, he is himself to propose me as tenant and farmer; it</p>
<p>gives him a look of acting for his master&#x27;s interests by finding him</p>
<p>nearly three per cent for his money, and a tenant who will pay well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How much will Moreau make, in all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if the count gives him ten thousand francs for the transaction</p>
<p>the matter will bring him fifty thousand,--and well-earned, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After all, the count, so they tell me, doesn&#x27;t like Presles. And then</p>
<p>he is so rich, what does it matter what it costs him?&quot; said the inn-</p>
<p>keeper. &quot;I have never seen him, myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor I,&quot; said Pere Leger. &quot;But he must be intending to live there, or</p>
<p>why should he spend two hundred thousand francs in restoring the</p>
<p>chateau? It is as fine now as the King&#x27;s own palace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; said the inn-keeper, &quot;it was high time for Moreau to</p>
<p>feather his nest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, for if the masters come there,&quot; replied Leger, &quot;they won&#x27;t keep</p>
<p>their eyes in their pockets.&quot;</p>
<p>The count lost not a word of this conversation, which was held in a</p>
<p>low voice, but not in a whisper.</p>
<p>&quot;Here I have actually found the proofs I was going down there to</p>
<p>seek,&quot; he thought, looking at the fat farmer as he entered the</p>
<p>kitchen. &quot;But perhaps,&quot; he added, &quot;it is only a scheme; Moreau may not</p>
<p>have listened to it.&quot;</p>
<p>So unwilling was he to believe that his steward could lend himself to</p>
<p>such a conspiracy.</p>
<p>Pierrotin here came out to water his horses. The count, thinking that</p>
<p>the driver would probably breakfast with the farmer and the inn-</p>
<p>keeper, feared some thoughtless indiscretion.</p>
<p>&quot;All these people combine against us,&quot; he thought; &quot;it is allowable to</p>
<p>baffle them-- Pierrotin,&quot; he said in a low voice as the man passed</p>
<p>him, &quot;I promised you ten louis to keep my secret; but if you continue</p>
<p>to conceal my name (and remember, I shall know if you pronounce it, or</p>
<p>make the slightest sign that reveals it to any one, no matter who,</p>
<p>here or at Isle-Adam, before to-night), I will give you to-morrow</p>
<p>morning, on your return trip, the thousand francs you need to pay for</p>
<p>your new coach. Therefore, by way of precaution,&quot; added the count,</p>
<p>striking Pierrotin, who was pale with happiness, on the shoulder,</p>
<p>&quot;don&#x27;t go in there to breakfast; stay with your horses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur le comte, I understand you; don&#x27;t be afraid! it relates to</p>
<p>Pere Leger, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It relates to every one,&quot; replied the count.</p>
<p>&quot;Make yourself easy.--Come, hurry,&quot; said Pierrotin, a few moments</p>
<p>later, putting his head into the kitchen. &quot;We are late. Pere Leger,</p>
<p>you know there&#x27;s a hill to climb; I&#x27;m not hungry, and I&#x27;ll drive on</p>
<p>slowly; you can soon overtake me,--it will do you good to walk a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a hurry you are in, Pierrotin!&quot; said the inn-keeper. &quot;Can&#x27;t you</p>
<p>stay and breakfast? The colonel here pays for the wine at fifty sous,</p>
<p>and has ordered a bottle of champagne.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve got a fish I must deliver by three o&#x27;clock for a great</p>
<p>dinner at Stors; there&#x27;s no fooling with customers, or fishes,</p>
<p>either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Pere Leger to the inn-keeper. &quot;You can harness that</p>
<p>horse you want to sell me into the cabriolet; we&#x27;ll breakfast in peace</p>
<p>and overtake Pierrotin, and I can judge of the beast as we go along.</p>
<p>We can go three in your jolter.&quot;</p>
<p>To the count&#x27;s surprise, Pierrotin himself rebridled the horses.</p>
<p>Schinner and Mistigris had walked on. Scarcely had Pierrotin overtaken</p>
<p>the two artists and was mounting the hill from which Ecouen, the</p>
<p>steeple of Mesnil, and the forests that surround that most beautiful</p>
<p>region, came in sight, when the gallop of a horse and the jingling of</p>
<p>a vehicle announced the coming of Pere Leger and the grandson of</p>
<p>Czerni-Georges, who were soon restored to their places in the coucou.</p>
<p>As Pierrotin drove down the narrow road to Moisselles, Georges, who</p>
<p>had so far not ceased to talk with the farmer of the beauty of the</p>
<p>hostess at Saint-Brice, suddenly exclaimed: &quot;Upon my word, this</p>
<p>landscape is not so bad, great painter, is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pooh! you who have seen the East and Spain can&#x27;t really admire it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve two cigars left! If no one objects, will you help me finish</p>
<p>them, Schinner? the little young man there seems to have found a whiff</p>
<p>or two enough for him.&quot;</p>
<p>Pere Leger and the count kept silence, which passed for consent.</p>
<p>Oscar, furious at being called a &quot;little young man,&quot; remarked, as the</p>
<p>other two were lighting their cigars:</p>
<p>&quot;I am not the aide-de-camp of Mina, monsieur, and I have not yet been</p>
<p>to the East, but I shall probably go there. The career to which my</p>
<p>family destine me will spare me, I trust, the annoyances of travelling</p>
<p>in a coucou before I reach your present age. When I once become a</p>
<p>personage I shall know how to maintain my station.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Et caetera punctum!&#x27;&quot; crowed Mistigris, imitating the hoarse voice</p>
<p>of a young cock; which made Oscar&#x27;s deliverance all the more absurd,</p>
<p>because he had just reached the age when the beard sprouts and the</p>
<p>voice breaks. &quot;&#x27;What a chit for chat!&#x27;&quot; added the rapin.</p>
<p>&quot;Your family, young man, destine you to some career, do they?&quot; said</p>
<p>Georges. &quot;Might I ask what it is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Diplomacy,&quot; replied Oscar.</p>
<p>Three bursts of laughter came from Mistigris, the great painter, and</p>
<p>the farmer. The count himself could not help smiling. Georges was</p>
<p>perfectly grave.</p>
<p>&quot;By Allah!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;I see nothing to laugh at in that. Though</p>
<p>it seems to me, young man, that your respectable mother is, at the</p>
<p>present moment, not exactly in the social sphere of an ambassadress.</p>
<p>She carried a handbag worthy of the utmost respect, and wore shoe-</p>
<p>strings which--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother, monsieur!&quot; exclaimed Oscar, in a tone of indignation.</p>
<p>&quot;That was the person in charge of our household.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Our household&#x27; is a very aristocratic term,&quot; remarked the count.</p>
<p>&quot;Kings have households,&quot; replied Oscar, proudly.</p>
<p>A look from Georges repressed the desire to laugh which took</p>
<p>possession of everybody; he contrived to make Mistigris and the</p>
<p>painter understand that it was necessary to manage Oscar cleverly in</p>
<p>order to work this new mine of amusement.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur is right,&quot; said the great Schinner to the count, motioning</p>
<p>towards Oscar. &quot;Well-bred people always talk of their &#x27;households&#x27;; it</p>
<p>is only common persons like ourselves who say &#x27;home.&#x27; For a man so</p>
<p>covered with decorations--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Nunc my eye, nunc alii,&#x27;&quot; whispered Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;--you seem to know little of the language of the courts. I ask your</p>
<p>future protection, Excellency,&quot; added Schinner, turning to Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;I congratulate myself on having travelled with three such</p>
<p>distinguished men,&quot; said the count,--&quot;a painter already famous, a</p>
<p>future general, and a young diplomatist who may some day recover</p>
<p>Belgium for France.&quot;</p>
<p>Having committed the odious crime of repudiating his mother, Oscar,</p>
<p>furious from a sense that his companions were laughing at him, now</p>
<p>resolved, at any cost, to make them pay attention to him.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;All is not gold that glitters,&#x27;&quot; he began, his eyes flaming.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s not it,&quot; said Mistigris. &quot;&#x27;All is not old that titters.&#x27;</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll never get on in diplomacy if you don&#x27;t know your proverbs</p>
<p>better than that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I may not know proverbs, but I know my way--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must be far,&quot; said Georges, &quot;for I saw that person in charge of</p>
<p>your household give you provisions enough for an ocean voyage: rolls,</p>
<p>chocolate--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A special kind of bread and chocolate, yes, monsieur,&quot; returned</p>
<p>Oscar; &quot;my stomach is much too delicate to digest the victuals of a</p>
<p>tavern.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Victuals&#x27; is a word as delicate and refined as your stomach,&quot; said</p>
<p>Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! I like that word &#x27;victuals,&#x27;&quot; cried the great painter.</p>
<p>&quot;The word is all the fashion in the best society,&quot; said Mistigris. &quot;I</p>
<p>use it myself at the cafe of the Black Hen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your tutor is, doubtless, some celebrated professor, isn&#x27;t he?--</p>
<p>Monsieur Andrieux of the Academie Francaise, or Monsieur Royer-</p>
<p>Collard?&quot; asked Schinner.</p>
<p>&quot;My tutor is or was the Abbe Loraux, now vicar of Saint-Sulpice,&quot;</p>
<p>replied Oscar, recollecting the name of the confessor at his school.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you were right to take a private tutor,&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tuto, tutor, celeritus, and jocund.&#x27; Of course, you will reward him</p>
<p>well, your abbe?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Undoubtedly he will be made a bishop some day,&quot; said Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;By your family influence?&quot; inquired Georges gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;We shall probably contribute to his rise, for the Abbe Frayssinous is</p>
<p>constantly at our house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you know the Abbe Frayssinous?&quot; asked the count.</p>
<p>&quot;He is under obligations to my father,&quot; answered Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you on your way to your estate?&quot; asked Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;No, monsieur; but I am able to say where I am going, if others are</p>
<p>not. I am going to the Chateau de Presles, to the Comte de Serizy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The devil! are you going to Presles?&quot; cried Schinner, turning as red</p>
<p>as a cherry.</p>
<p>&quot;So you know his Excellency the Comte de Serizy?&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>Pere Leger turned round to look at Oscar with a stupefied air.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Monsieur de Serizy at Presles?&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Apparently, as I am going there,&quot; replied Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you often see the count,&quot; asked Monsieur de Serizy.</p>
<p>&quot;Often,&quot; replied Oscar. &quot;I am a comrade of his son, who is about my</p>
<p>age, nineteen; we ride together on horseback nearly every day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Aut Caesar, aut Serizy,&#x27;&quot; said Mistigris, sententiously.</p>
<p>Pierrotin and Pere Leger exchanged winks on hearing this statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Really,&quot; said the count to Oscar, &quot;I am delighted to meet with a</p>
<p>young man who can tell me about that personage. I want his influence</p>
<p>on a rather serious matter, although it would cost him nothing to</p>
<p>oblige me. It concerns a claim I wish to press on the American</p>
<p>government. I should be glad to obtain information about Monsieur de</p>
<p>Serizy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! if you want to succeed,&quot; replied Oscar, with a knowing look,</p>
<p>&quot;don&#x27;t go to him, but go to his wife; he is madly in love with her; no</p>
<p>one knows more than I do about that; but she can&#x27;t endure him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;The count has a skin disease which makes him hideous. Doctor Albert</p>
<p>has tried in vain to cure it. The count would give half his fortune if</p>
<p>he had a chest like mine,&quot; said Oscar, swelling himself out. &quot;He lives</p>
<p>a lonely life in his own house; gets up very early in the morning and</p>
<p>works from three to eight o&#x27;clock; after eight he takes his remedies,</p>
<p>--sulphur-baths, steam-baths, and such things. His valet bakes him in</p>
<p>a sort of iron box--for he is always in hopes of getting cured.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he is such a friend of the King as they say he is, why doesn&#x27;t he</p>
<p>get his Majesty to touch him?&quot; asked Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;The count has lately promised thirty thousand francs to a celebrated</p>
<p>Scotch doctor who is coming over to treat him,&quot; continued Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Then his wife can&#x27;t be blamed if she finds better--&quot; said Schinner,</p>
<p>but he did not finish his sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;I should say so!&quot; resumed Oscar. &quot;The poor man is so shrivelled and</p>
<p>old you would take him for eighty! He&#x27;s as dry as parchment, and,</p>
<p>unluckily for him, he feels his position.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most men would,&quot; said Pere Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;He adores his wife and dares not find fault with her,&quot; pursued Oscar,</p>
<p>rejoicing to have found a topic to which they listened. &quot;He plays</p>
<p>scenes with her which would make you die of laughing,--exactly like</p>
<p>Arnolphe in Moliere&#x27;s comedy.&quot;</p>
<p>The count, horror-stricken, looked at Pierrotin, who, finding that the</p>
<p>count said nothing, concluded that Madame Clapart&#x27;s son was telling</p>
<p>falsehoods.</p>
<p>&quot;So, monsieur,&quot; continued Oscar, &quot;if you want the count&#x27;s influence, I</p>
<p>advise you to apply to the Marquis d&#x27;Aiglemont. If you get that former</p>
<p>adorer of Madame de Serizy on your side, you will win husband and wife</p>
<p>at one stroke.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look here!&quot; said the painter, &quot;you seem to have seen the count</p>
<p>without his clothes; are you his valet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His valet!&quot; cried Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Hang it! people don&#x27;t tell such things about their friends in public</p>
<p>conveyances,&quot; exclaimed Mistigris. &quot;As for me, I&#x27;m not listening to</p>
<p>you; I&#x27;m deaf: &#x27;discretion plays the better part of adder.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;A poet is nasty and not fit,&#x27; and so is a tale-bearer,&quot; cried</p>
<p>Schinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Great painter,&quot; said Georges, sententiously, &quot;learn this: you can&#x27;t</p>
<p>say harm of people you don&#x27;t know. Now the little one here has proved,</p>
<p>indubitably, that he knows his Serizy by heart. If he had told us</p>
<p>about the countess, perhaps--?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop! not a word about the Comtesse de Serizy, young men,&quot; cried the</p>
<p>count. &quot;I am a friend of her brother, the Marquis de Ronquerolles, and</p>
<p>whoever attempts to speak disparagingly of the countess must answer to</p>
<p>me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur is right,&quot; cried the painter; &quot;no man should blaguer women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God, Honor, and the Ladies! I believe in that melodrama,&quot; said</p>
<p>Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know the guerrilla chieftain, Mina, but I know the Keeper of</p>
<p>the Seals,&quot; continued the count, looking at Georges; &quot;and though I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t wear my decorations,&quot; he added, looking at the painter, &quot;I</p>
<p>prevent those who do not deserve them from obtaining any. And finally,</p>
<p>let me say that I know so many persons that I even know Monsieur</p>
<p>Grindot, the architect of Presles. Pierrotin, stop at the next inn; I</p>
<p>want to get out a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>Pierrotin hurried his horses through the village street of Moisselles,</p>
<p>at the end of which was the inn where all travellers stopped. This</p>
<p>short distance was done in silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is that young fool going?&quot; asked the count, drawing Pierrotin</p>
<p>into the inn-yard.</p>
<p>&quot;To your steward. He is the son of a poor lady who lives in the rue de</p>
<p>la Cerisaie, to whom I often carry fruit, and game, and poultry from</p>
<p>Presles. She is a Madame Husson.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that man?&quot; inquired Pere Leger of Pierrotin when the count had</p>
<p>left him.</p>
<p>&quot;Faith, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; replied Pierrotin; &quot;this is the first time I</p>
<p>have driven him. I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if he was that prince who</p>
<p>owns Maffliers. He has just told me to leave him on the road near</p>
<p>there; he doesn&#x27;t want to go on to Isle-Adam.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pierrotin thinks he is the master of Maffliers,&quot; said Pere Leger,</p>
<p>addressing Georges when he got back into the coach.</p>
<p>The three young fellows were now as dull as thieves caught in the act;</p>
<p>they dared not look at each other, and were evidently considering the</p>
<p>consequences of their fibs.</p>
<p>&quot;This is what is called &#x27;suffering for license sake,&#x27;&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;You see I did know the count,&quot; said Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Possibly. But you&#x27;ll never be an ambassador,&quot; replied Georges. &quot;When</p>
<p>people want to talk in public conveyances, they ought to be careful,</p>
<p>like me, to talk without saying anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s what speech is for,&quot; remarked Mistigris, by way of conclusion.</p>
<p>The count returned to his seat and the coucou rolled on amid the</p>
<p>deepest silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my friends,&quot; said the count, when they reached the Carreau</p>
<p>woods, &quot;here we all are, as silent as if we were going to the</p>
<p>scaffold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Silence gives content,&#x27;&quot; muttered Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;The weather is fine,&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;What place is that?&quot; said Oscar, pointing to the chateau de</p>
<p>Franconville, which produces a fine effect at that particular spot,</p>
<p>backed, as it is, by the noble forest of Saint-Martin.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it,&quot; cried the count, &quot;that you, who say you go so often to</p>
<p>Presles, do not know Franconville?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur knows men, not castles,&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Budding diplomatists have so much else to take their minds,&quot; remarked</p>
<p>Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Be so good as to remember my name,&quot; replied Oscar, furious. &quot;I am</p>
<p>Oscar Husson, and ten years hence I shall be famous.&quot;</p>
<p>After that speech, uttered with bombastic assumption, Oscar flung</p>
<p>himself back in his corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Husson of what, of where?&quot; asked Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a great family,&quot; replied the count. &quot;Husson de la Cerisaie;</p>
<p>monsieur was born beneath the steps of the Imperial throne.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar colored crimson to the roots of his hair, and was penetrated</p>
<p>through and through with a dreadful foreboding.</p>
<p>They were now about to descend the steep hill of La Cave, at the foot</p>
<p>of which, in a narrow valley, flanked by the forest of Saint-Martin,</p>
<p>stands the magnificent chateau of Presles.</p>
<p>&quot;Messieurs,&quot; said the count, &quot;I wish you every good fortune in your</p>
<p>various careers. Monsieur le colonel, make your peace with the King of</p>
<p>France; the Czerni-Georges ought not to snub the Bourbons. I have</p>
<p>nothing to wish for you, my dear Monsieur Schinner; your fame is</p>
<p>already won, and nobly won by splendid work. But you are much to be</p>
<p>feared in domestic life, and I, being a married man, dare not invite</p>
<p>you to my house. As for Monsieur Husson, he needs no protection; he</p>
<p>possesses the secrets of statesmen and can make them tremble. Monsieur</p>
<p>Leger is about to pluck the Comte de Serizy, and I can only exhort him</p>
<p>to do it with a firm hand. Pierrotin, put me out here, and pick me up</p>
<p>at the same place to-morrow,&quot; added the count, who then left the coach</p>
<p>and took a path through the woods, leaving his late companions</p>
<p>confused and bewildered.</p>
<p>&quot;He must be that count who has hired Franconville; that&#x27;s the path to</p>
<p>it,&quot; said Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;If ever again,&quot; said the false Schinner, &quot;I am caught blague-ing in a</p>
<p>public coach, I&#x27;ll fight a duel with myself. It was your fault,</p>
<p>Mistigris,&quot; giving his rapin a tap on the head.</p>
<p>&quot;All I did was to help you out, and follow you to Venice,&quot; said</p>
<p>Mistigris; &quot;but that&#x27;s always the way, &#x27;Fortune belabors the slave.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me tell you,&quot; said Georges to his neighbor Oscar, &quot;that if, by</p>
<p>chance, that was the Comte de Serizy, I wouldn&#x27;t be in your skin for a</p>
<p>good deal, healthy as you think it.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar, remembering his mother&#x27;s injunctions, which these words</p>
<p>recalled to his mind, turned pale and came to his senses.</p>
<p>&quot;Here you are, messieurs!&quot; cried Pierrotin, pulling up at a fine iron</p>
<p>gate.</p>
<p>&quot;Here we are--where?&quot; said the painter, and Georges, and Oscar all at</p>
<p>once.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; exclaimed Pierrotin, &quot;if that doesn&#x27;t beat all! Ah ca,</p>
<p>monsieurs, have none of you been here before? Why, this is the chateau</p>
<p>de Presles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes; all right, friend,&quot; said Georges, recovering his audacity.</p>
<p>&quot;But I happen to be going on to Les Moulineaux,&quot; he added, not wishing</p>
<p>his companions to know that he was really going to the chateau.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t say so? Then you are coming to me,&quot; said Pere Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;How so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I&#x27;m the farmer at Moulineaux. Hey, colonel, what brings you</p>
<p>there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To taste your butter,&quot; said Georges, pulling out his portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;Pierrotin,&quot; said Oscar, &quot;leave my things at the steward&#x27;s. I am going</p>
<p>straight to the chateau.&quot;</p>
<p>Whereupon Oscar plunged into a narrow path, not knowing, in the least,</p>
<p>where he was going.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi! Monsieur l&#x27;ambassadeur,&quot; cried Pere Leger, &quot;that&#x27;s the way to the</p>
<p>forest; if you really want to get to the chateau, go through the</p>
<p>little gate.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus compelled to enter, Oscar disappeared into the grand court-yard.</p>
<p>While Pere Leger stood watching Oscar, Georges, utterly confounded by</p>
<p>the discovery that the farmer was the present occupant of Les</p>
<p>Moulineaux, has slipped away so adroitly that when the fat countryman</p>
<p>looked round for his colonel there was no sign of him.</p>
<p>The iron gates opened at Pierrotin&#x27;s demand, and he proudly drove in</p>
<p>to deposit with the concierge the thousand and one utensils belonging</p>
<p>to the great Schinner. Oscar was thunderstruck when he became aware</p>
<p>that Mistigris and his master, the witnesses of his bravado, were to</p>
<p>be installed in the chateau itself. In ten minutes Pierrotin had</p>
<p>discharged the various packages of the painter, the bundles of Oscar</p>
<p>Husson, and the pretty little leather portmanteau, which he took from</p>
<p>its nest of hay and confided mysteriously to the wife of the</p>
<p>concierge. Then he drove out of the courtyard, cracking his whip, and</p>
<p>took the road that led through the forest to Isle-Adam, his face</p>
<p>beaming with the sly expression of a peasant who calculates his</p>
<p>profits. Nothing was lacking now to his happiness; on the morrow he</p>
<p>would have his thousand francs, and, as a consequence, his magnificent</p>
<p>new coach.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>THE MOREAU INTERIOR</p>
<p>Oscar, somewhat abashed, was skulking behind a clump of trees in the</p>
<p>centre of the court-yard, and watching to see what became of his two</p>
<p>road-companions, when Monsieur Moreau suddenly came out upon the</p>
<p>portico from what was called the guard-room. He was dressed in a long</p>
<p>blue overcoat which came to his heels, breeches of yellowish leather</p>
<p>and top-boots, and in his hand he carried a riding-whip.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! my boy, so here you are? How is the dear mamma?&quot; he said, taking</p>
<p>Oscar by the hand. &quot;Good-day, messieurs,&quot; he added to Mistigris and</p>
<p>his master, who then came forward. &quot;You are, no doubt, the two</p>
<p>painters whom Monsieur Grindot, the architect, told me to expect.&quot;</p>
<p>He whistled twice at the end of his whip; the concierge came.</p>
<p>&quot;Take these gentlemen to rooms 14 and 15. Madame Moreau will give you</p>
<p>the keys. Go with them to show the way; make fires there, if</p>
<p>necessary, and take up all their things. I have orders from Monsieur</p>
<p>le comte,&quot; he added, addressing the two young men, &quot;to invite you to</p>
<p>my table, messieurs; we dine at five, as in Paris. If you like</p>
<p>hunting, you will find plenty to amuse you; I have a license from the</p>
<p>Eaux et Forets; and we hunt over twelve thousand acres of forest, not</p>
<p>counting our own domain.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar, the painter, and Mistigris, all more or less subdued, exchanged</p>
<p>glances, but Mistigris, faithful to himself, remarked in a low tone,</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Veni, vidi, cecidi,--I came, I saw, I slaughtered.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar followed the steward, who led him along at a rapid pace through</p>
<p>the park.</p>
<p>&quot;Jacques,&quot; said Moreau to one of his children whom they met, &quot;run in</p>
<p>and tell your mother that little Husson has come, and say to her that</p>
<p>I am obliged to go to Les Moulineaux for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>The steward, then about fifty years old, was a dark man of medium</p>
<p>height, and seemed stern. His bilious complexion, to which country</p>
<p>habits had added a certain violent coloring, conveyed, at first sight,</p>
<p>the impression of a nature which was other than his own. His blue eyes</p>
<p>and a large crow-beaked nose gave him an air that was the more</p>
<p>threatening because his eyes were placed too close together. But his</p>
<p>large lips, the outline of his face, and the easy good-humor of his</p>
<p>manner soon showed that his nature was a kindly one. Abrupt in speech</p>
<p>and decided in tone, he impressed Oscar immensely by the force of his</p>
<p>penetration, inspired, no doubt, by the affection which he felt for</p>
<p>the boy. Trained by his mother to magnify the steward, Oscar had</p>
<p>always felt himself very small in Moreau&#x27;s presence; but on reaching</p>
<p>Presles a new sensation came over him, as if he expected some harm</p>
<p>from this fatherly figure, his only protector.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my Oscar, you don&#x27;t look pleased at getting here,&quot; said the</p>
<p>steward. &quot;And yet you&#x27;ll find plenty of amusement; you shall learn to</p>
<p>ride on horseback, and shoot, and hunt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know any of those things,&quot; said Oscar, stupidly.</p>
<p>&quot;But I brought you here to learn them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma told me only to stay two weeks because of Madame Moreau.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! we&#x27;ll see about that,&quot; replied Moreau, rather wounded that his</p>
<p>conjugal authority was doubted.</p>
<p>Moreau&#x27;s youngest son, an active, strapping lad of twelve, here ran</p>
<p>up.</p>
<p>&quot;Come,&quot; said his father, &quot;take Oscar to your mother.&quot;</p>
<p>He himself went rapidly along the shortest path to the gamekeeper&#x27;s</p>
<p>house, which was situated between the park and the forest.</p>
<p>The pavilion, or lodge, in which the count had established his</p>
<p>steward, was built a few years before the Revolution. It stood in the</p>
<p>centre of a large garden, one wall of which adjoined the court-yard of</p>
<p>the stables and offices of the chateau itself. Formerly its chief</p>
<p>entrance was on the main road to the village. But after the count&#x27;s</p>
<p>father bought the building, he closed that entrance and united the</p>
<p>place with his own property.</p>
<p>The house, built of freestone, in the style of the period of Louis XV.</p>
<p>(it is enough to say that its exterior decoration consisted of a stone</p>
<p>drapery beneath the windows, as in the colonnades of the Place Louis</p>
<p>XV., the flutings of which were stiff and ungainly), had on the</p>
<p>ground-floor a fine salon opening into a bedroom, and a dining-room</p>
<p>connected with a billiard-room. These rooms, lying parallel to one</p>
<p>another, were separated by a staircase, in front of which was a sort</p>
<p>of peristyle which formed an entrance-hall, on which the two suits of</p>
<p>rooms on either side opened. The kitchen was beneath the dining-room,</p>
<p>for the whole building was raised ten steps from the ground level.</p>
<p>By placing her own bedroom on the first floor above the ground-floor,</p>
<p>Madame Moreau was able to transform the chamber adjoining the salon</p>
<p>into a boudoir. These two rooms were richly furnished with beautiful</p>
<p>pieces culled from the rare old furniture of the chateau. The salon,</p>
<p>hung with blue and white damask, formerly the curtains of the state-</p>
<p>bed, was draped with ample portieres and window curtains lined with</p>
<p>white silk. Pictures, evidently from old panels, plant-stands, various</p>
<p>pretty articles of modern upholstery, handsome lamps, and a rare old</p>
<p>cut-glass chandelier, gave a grandiose appearance to the room. The</p>
<p>carpet was a Persian rug. The boudoir, wholly modern, and furnished</p>
<p>entirely after Madame Moreau&#x27;s own taste, was arranged in imitation of</p>
<p>a tent, with ropes of blue silk on a gray background. The classic</p>
<p>divan was there, of course, with its pillows and footstools. The</p>
<p>plant-stands, taken care of by the head-gardener of Presles, rejoiced</p>
<p>the eye with their pyramids of bloom. The dining-room and billiard-</p>
<p>room were furnished in mahogany.</p>
<p>Around the house the steward&#x27;s wife had laid out a beautiful garden,</p>
<p>carefully cultivated, which opened into the great park. Groups of</p>
<p>choice parks hid the offices and stables. To improve the entrance by</p>
<p>which visitors came to see her, she had substituted a handsome iron</p>
<p>gateway for the shabby railing, which she discarded.</p>
<p>The dependence in which the situation of their dwelling placed the</p>
<p>Moreaus, was thus adroitly concealed, and they seemed all the more</p>
<p>like rich and independent persons taking care of the property of a</p>
<p>friend, because neither the count nor the countess ever came to</p>
<p>Presles to take down their pretensions. Moreover, the perquisites</p>
<p>granted by Monsieur de Serizy allowed them to live in the midst of</p>
<p>that abundance which is the luxury of country life. Milk, eggs,</p>
<p>poultry, game, fruits, flowers, forage, vegetables, wood, the steward</p>
<p>and his wife used in profusion, buying absolutely nothing but</p>
<p>butcher&#x27;s-meat, wines, and the colonial supplies required by their</p>
<p>life of luxury. The poultry-maid baked their bread; and of late years</p>
<p>Moreau had paid his butcher with pigs from the farm, after reserving</p>
<p>those he needed for his own use.</p>
<p>On one occasion, the countess, always kind and good to her former</p>
<p>maid, gave her, as a souvenir perhaps, a little travelling-carriage,</p>
<p>the fashion of which was out of date. Moreau had it repainted, and now</p>
<p>drove his wife about the country with two good horses which belonged</p>
<p>to the farm. Besides these horses, Moreau had his own saddle-horse. He</p>
<p>did enough farming on the count&#x27;s property to keep the horses and</p>
<p>maintain his servants. He stacked three hundred tons of excellent hay,</p>
<p>but accounted for only one hundred, making use of a vague permission</p>
<p>once granted by the count. He kept his poultry-yard, pigeon-cotes, and</p>
<p>cattle at the cost of the estate, but the manure of the stables was</p>
<p>used by the count&#x27;s gardeners. All these little stealings had some</p>
<p>ostensible excuse.</p>
<p>Madame Moreau had taken into her service a daughter of one of the</p>
<p>gardeners, who was first her maid and afterwards her cook. The</p>
<p>poultry-game, also the dairy-maid, assisted in the work of the</p>
<p>household; and the steward had hired a discharged soldier to groom the</p>
<p>horses and do the heavy labor.</p>
<p>At Nerville, Chaumont, Maffliers, Nointel, and other places of the</p>
<p>neighborhood, the handsome wife of the steward was received by persons</p>
<p>who either did not know, or pretended not to know her previous</p>
<p>condition. Moreau did services to many persons. He induced his master</p>
<p>to agree to certain things which seem trifles in Paris, but are really</p>
<p>of immense importance in the country. After bringing about the</p>
<p>appointment of a certain &quot;juge de paix&quot; at Beaumont and also at Isle-</p>
<p>Adam, he had, in the same year, prevented the dismissal of a keeper-</p>
<p>general of the Forests, and obtained the cross of the Legion of honor</p>
<p>for the first cavalry-sergeant at Beaumont. Consequently, no festivity</p>
<p>was ever given among the bourgeoisie to which Monsieur and Madame</p>
<p>Moreau were not invited. The rector of Presles and the mayor of</p>
<p>Presles came every evening to play cards with them. It is difficult</p>
<p>for a man not to be kind and hospitable after feathering his nest so</p>
<p>comfortably.</p>
<p>A pretty woman, and an affected one, as all retired waiting-maids of</p>
<p>great ladies are, for after they are married they imitate their</p>
<p>mistresses, Madame Moreau imported from Paris all the new fashions.</p>
<p>She wore expensive boots, and never was seen on foot, except,</p>
<p>occasionally, in the finest weather. Though her husband allowed but</p>
<p>five hundred francs a year for her toilet, that sum is immense in the</p>
<p>provinces, especially if well laid out. So that Madame Moreau, fair,</p>
<p>rosy, and fresh, about thirty-six years of age, still slender and</p>
<p>delicate in shape in spite of her three children, played the young</p>
<p>girl and gave herself the airs of a princess. If, when she drove by in</p>
<p>her caleche, some stranger had asked, &quot;Who is she?&quot; Madame Moreau</p>
<p>would have been furious had she heard the reply: &quot;The wife of the</p>
<p>steward at Presles.&quot; She wished to be taken for the mistress of the</p>
<p>chateau. In the villages, she patronized the people in the tone of a</p>
<p>great lady. The influence of her husband over the count, proved in so</p>
<p>many years, prevented the small bourgeoisie from laughing at Madame</p>
<p>Moreau, who, in the eyes of the peasants, was really a personage.</p>
<p>Estelle (her name was Estelle) took no more part in the affairs of the</p>
<p>stewardship then the wife of a broker does in her husband&#x27;s affairs at</p>
<p>the Bourse. She even depended on Moreau for the care of the household</p>
<p>and their own fortune. Confident of his MEANS, she was a thousand</p>
<p>leagues from dreaming that this comfortable existence, which had</p>
<p>lasted for seventeen years, could ever be endangered. And yet, when</p>
<p>she heard of the count&#x27;s determination to restore the magnificent</p>
<p>chateau, she felt that her enjoyments were threatened, and she urged</p>
<p>her husband to come to the arrangement with Leger about Les</p>
<p>Moulineaux, so that they might retire from Presles and live at Isle-</p>
<p>Adam. She had no intention of returning to a position that was more or</p>
<p>less that of a servant in presence of her former mistress, who,</p>
<p>indeed, would have laughed to see her established in the lodge with</p>
<p>all the airs and graces of a woman of the world.</p>
<p>The rancorous enmity which existed between the Reyberts and the</p>
<p>Moreaus came from a wound inflicted by Madame de Reybert upon Madame</p>
<p>Moreau on the first occasion when the latter assumed precedence over</p>
<p>the former on her first arrival at Presles, the wife of the steward</p>
<p>being determined not to allow her supremacy to be undermined by a</p>
<p>woman nee de Corroy. Madame de Reybert thereupon reminded, or,</p>
<p>perhaps, informed the whole country-side of Madame Moreau&#x27;s former</p>
<p>station. The words &quot;waiting-maid&quot; flew from lip to lip. The envious</p>
<p>acquaintances of the Moreaus throughout the neighborhood from Beaumont</p>
<p>to Moisselles, began to carp and criticize with such eagerness that a</p>
<p>few sparks of the conflagration fell into the Moreau household. For</p>
<p>four years the Reyberts, cut dead by the handsome Estelle, found</p>
<p>themselves the objects of so much animadversion on the part of the</p>
<p>adherents of the Moreaus that their position at Presles would not have</p>
<p>been endurable without the thought of vengeance which had, so far,</p>
<p>supported them.</p>
<p>The Moreaus, who were very friendly with Grindot the architect, had</p>
<p>received notice from him of the early arrival of the two painters sent</p>
<p>down to finish the decorations of the chateau, the principal paintings</p>
<p>for which were just completed by Schinner. The great painter had</p>
<p>recommended for this work the artist who was accompanied by Mistigris.</p>
<p>For two days past Madame Moreau had been on the tiptoe of expectation,</p>
<p>and had put herself under arms to receive him. An artist, who was to</p>
<p>be her guest and companion for weeks, demanded some effort. Schinner</p>
<p>and his wife had their own apartment at the chateau, where, by the</p>
<p>count&#x27;s express orders, they were treated with all the consideration</p>
<p>due to himself. Grindot, who stayed at the steward&#x27;s house, showed</p>
<p>such respect for the great artist that neither the steward nor his</p>
<p>wife had attempted to put themselves on familiar terms with him.</p>
<p>Moreover, the noblest and richest people in the surrounding country</p>
<p>had vied with each other in paying attention to Schinner and his wife.</p>
<p>So, very well pleased to have, as it were, a little revenge of her</p>
<p>own, Madame Moreau was determined to cry up the artist she was now</p>
<p>expecting, and to present him to her social circle as equal in talent</p>
<p>to the great Schinner.</p>
<p>Though for two days past Moreau&#x27;s pretty wife had arrayed herself</p>
<p>coquettishly, the prettiest of her toilets had been reserved for this</p>
<p>very Saturday, when, as she felt no doubt, the artist would arrive for</p>
<p>dinner. A pink gown in very narrow stripes, a pink belt with a richly</p>
<p>chased gold buckle, a velvet ribbon and cross at her throat, and</p>
<p>velvet bracelets on her bare arms (Madame de Serizy had handsome arms</p>
<p>and showed them much), together with bronze kid shoes and thread</p>
<p>stockings, gave Madame Moreau all the appearance of an elegant</p>
<p>Parisian. She wore, also, a superb bonnet of Leghorn straw, trimmed</p>
<p>with a bunch of moss roses from Nattier&#x27;s, beneath the spreading sides</p>
<p>of which rippled the curls of her beautiful blond hair.</p>
<p>After ordering a very choice dinner and reviewing the condition of her</p>
<p>rooms, she walked about the grounds, so as to be seen standing near a</p>
<p>flower-bed in the court-yard of the chateau, like the mistress of the</p>
<p>house, on the arrival of the coach from Paris. She held above her head</p>
<p>a charming rose-colored parasol lined with white silk and fringed.</p>
<p>Seeing that Pierrotin merely left Mistigris&#x27;s queer packages with the</p>
<p>concierge, having, apparently, brought no passengers, Estelle retired</p>
<p>disappointed and regretting the trouble of making her useless toilet.</p>
<p>Like many persons who are dressed in their best, she felt incapable of</p>
<p>any other occupation than that of sitting idly in her salon awaiting</p>
<p>the coach from Beaumont, which usually passed about an hour after that</p>
<p>of Pierrotin, though it did not leave Paris till mid-day. She was,</p>
<p>therefore, in her own apartment when the two artists walked up to the</p>
<p>chateau, and were sent by Moreau himself to their rooms where they</p>
<p>made their regulation toilet for dinner. The pair had asked questions</p>
<p>of their guide, the gardener, who told them so much of Moreau&#x27;s beauty</p>
<p>that they felt the necessity of &quot;rigging themselves up&quot; (studio</p>
<p>slang). They, therefore, put on their most superlative suits and then</p>
<p>walked over to the steward&#x27;s lodge, piloted by Jacques Moreau, the</p>
<p>eldest son, a hardy youth, dressed like an English boy in a handsome</p>
<p>jacket with a turned-over collar, who was spending his vacation like a</p>
<p>fish in water on the estate where his father and mother reigned as</p>
<p>aristocrats.</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma,&quot; he said, &quot;here are the two artists sent down by Monsieur</p>
<p>Schinner.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Moreau, agreeably surprised, rose, told her son to place</p>
<p>chairs, and began to display her graces.</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma, the Husson boy is with papa,&quot; added the lad; &quot;shall I fetch</p>
<p>him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You need not hurry; go and play with him,&quot; said his mother.</p>
<p>The remark &quot;you need not hurry&quot; proved to the two artists the</p>
<p>unimportance of their late travelling companion in the eyes of their</p>
<p>hostess; but it also showed, what they did not know, the feeling of a</p>
<p>step-mother against a step-son. Madame Moreau, after seventeen years</p>
<p>of married life, could not be ignorant of the steward&#x27;s attachment to</p>
<p>Madame Clapart and the little Husson, and she hated both mother and</p>
<p>child so vehemently that it is not surprising that Moreau had never</p>
<p>before risked bringing Oscar to Presles.</p>
<p>&quot;We are requested, my husband and myself,&quot; she said to the two</p>
<p>artists, &quot;to do you the honors of the chateau. We both love art, and,</p>
<p>above all, artists,&quot; she added in a mincing tone; &quot;and I beg you to</p>
<p>make yourselves at home here. In the country, you know, every one</p>
<p>should be at their ease; one must feel wholly at liberty, or life is</p>
<p>TOO insipid. We have already had Monsieur Schinner with us.&quot;</p>
<p>Mistigris gave a sly glance at his companion.</p>
<p>&quot;You know him, of course?&quot; continued Estelle, after a slight pause.</p>
<p>&quot;Who does not know him, madame?&quot; said the painter.</p>
<p>&quot;Knows him like his double,&quot; remarked Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Grindot told me your name,&quot; said Madame Moreau to the</p>
<p>painter. &quot;But--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Joseph Bridau,&quot; he replied, wondering with what sort of woman he had</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>Mistigris began to rebel internally against the patronizing manner of</p>
<p>the steward&#x27;s wife; but he waited, like Bridau, for some word which</p>
<p>might give him his cue; one of those words &quot;de singe a dauphin&quot; which</p>
<p>artists, cruel, born-observers of the ridiculous--the pabulum of their</p>
<p>pencils--seize with such avidity. Meantime Estelle&#x27;s clumsy hands and</p>
<p>feet struck their eyes, and presently a word, or phrase or two,</p>
<p>betrayed her past, and quite out of keeping with the elegance of her</p>
<p>dress, made the two young fellows aware of their prey. A single glance</p>
<p>at each other was enough to arrange a scheme that they should take</p>
<p>Estelle seriously on her own ground, and thus find amusement enough</p>
<p>during the time of their stay.</p>
<p>&quot;You say you love art, madame; perhaps you cultivate it successfully,&quot;</p>
<p>said Joseph Bridau.</p>
<p>&quot;No. Without being neglected, my education was purely commercial; but</p>
<p>I have so profound and delicate a sense of art that Monsieur Schinner</p>
<p>always asked me, when he had finished a piece of work, to give him my</p>
<p>opinion on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just as Moliere consulted La Foret,&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>Not knowing that La Foret was Moliere&#x27;s servant-woman, Madame Moreau</p>
<p>inclined her head graciously, showing that in her ignorance she</p>
<p>accepted the speech as a compliment.</p>
<p>&quot;Didn&#x27;t he propose to &#x27;croquer&#x27; you?&quot; asked Bridau. &quot;Painters are</p>
<p>eager enough after handsome women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What may you mean by such language?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the studios we say croquer, craunch, nibble, for sketching,&quot;</p>
<p>interposed Mistigris, with an insinuating air, &quot;and we are always</p>
<p>wanting to croquer beautiful heads. That&#x27;s the origin of the</p>
<p>expression, &#x27;She is pretty enough to eat.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was not aware of the origin of the term,&quot; she replied, with the</p>
<p>sweetest glance at Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;My pupil here,&quot; said Bridau, &quot;Monsieur Leon de Lora, shows a</p>
<p>remarkable talent for portraiture. He would be too happy, I know, to</p>
<p>leave you a souvenir of our stay by painting your charming head,</p>
<p>madame.&quot;</p>
<p>Joseph Bridau made a sign to Mistigris which meant: &quot;Come, sail in,</p>
<p>and push the matter; she is not so bad in looks, this woman.&quot;</p>
<p>Accepting the glance, Leon de Lora slid down upon the sofa beside</p>
<p>Estelle and took her hand, which she permitted.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! madame, if you would like to offer a surprise to your husband,</p>
<p>and will give me a few secret sittings I would endeavor to surpass</p>
<p>myself. You are so beautiful, so fresh, so charming! A man without any</p>
<p>talent might become a genius in painting you. He would draw from your</p>
<p>eyes--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must paint your dear children in the arabesques,&quot; said Bridau,</p>
<p>interrupting Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;I would rather have them in the salon; but perhaps I am indiscreet in</p>
<p>asking it,&quot; she replied, looking at Bridau coquettishly.</p>
<p>&quot;Beauty, madame, is a sovereign whom all painters worship; it has</p>
<p>unlimited claims upon them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are both charming,&quot; thought Madame Moreau. &quot;Do you enjoy</p>
<p>driving? Shall I take you through the woods, after dinner, in my</p>
<p>carriage?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! oh! oh!&quot; cried Mistigris, in three ecstatic tones. &quot;Why, Presles</p>
<p>will prove our terrestrial paradise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With an Eve, a fair, young, fascinating woman,&quot; added Bridau.</p>
<p>Just as Madame Moreau was bridling, and soaring to the seventh heaven,</p>
<p>she was recalled like a kite by a twitch at its line.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame!&quot; cried her maid-servant, bursting into the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Rosalie,&quot; said her mistress, &quot;who allowed you to come here without</p>
<p>being sent for?&quot;</p>
<p>Rosalie paid no heed to the rebuke, but whispered in her mistress&#x27;s</p>
<p>ear:--</p>
<p>&quot;The count is at the chateau.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has he asked for me?&quot; said the steward&#x27;s wife.</p>
<p>&quot;No, madame; but he wants his trunk and the key of his apartment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then give them to him,&quot; she replied, making an impatient gesture to</p>
<p>hide her real trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;Mamma! here&#x27;s Oscar Husson,&quot; said her youngest son, bringing in</p>
<p>Oscar, who turned as red as a poppy on seeing the two artists in</p>
<p>evening dress.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! so you have come, my little Oscar,&quot; said Estelle, stiffly. &quot;I</p>
<p>hope you will now go and dress,&quot; she added, after looking at him</p>
<p>contemptuously from head to foot. &quot;Your mother, I presume, has not</p>
<p>accustomed you to dine in such clothes as those.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; cried the cruel Mistigris, &quot;a future diplomatist knows the</p>
<p>saying that &#x27;two coats are better than none.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you mean, a future diplomatist?&quot; exclaimed Madame Moreau.</p>
<p>Poor Oscar had tears in his eyes as he looked in turn from Joseph to</p>
<p>Leon.</p>
<p>&quot;Merely a joke made in travelling,&quot; replied Joseph, who wanted to save</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s feelings out of pity.</p>
<p>&quot;The boy just wanted to be funny like the rest of us, and he blagued,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s all,&quot; said Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame,&quot; said Rosalie, returning to the door of the salon, &quot;his</p>
<p>Excellency has ordered dinner for eight, and wants it served at six</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock. What are we to do?&quot;</p>
<p>During Estelle&#x27;s conference with her head-woman the two artists and</p>
<p>Oscar looked at each other in consternation; their glances were</p>
<p>expressive of terrible apprehension.</p>
<p>&quot;His Excellency! who is he?&quot; said Joseph Bridau.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Monsieur le Comte de Serizy, of course,&quot; replied little Moreau.</p>
<p>&quot;Could it have been the count in the coucou?&quot; said Leon de Lora.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed Oscar, &quot;the Comte de Serizy always travels in his own</p>
<p>carriage with four horses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did the Comte de Serizy get here?&quot; said the painter to Madame</p>
<p>Moreau, when she returned, much discomfited, to the salon.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure I do not know,&quot; she said. &quot;I cannot explain to myself this</p>
<p>sudden arrival; nor do I know what has brought him-- And Moreau not</p>
<p>here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His Excellency wishes Monsieur Schinner to come over to the chateau,&quot;</p>
<p>said the gardener, coming to the door of the salon. &quot;And he begs</p>
<p>Monsieur Schinner to give him the pleasure to dine with him; also</p>
<p>Monsieur Mistigris.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Done for!&quot; cried the rapin, laughing. &quot;He whom we took for a</p>
<p>bourgeois in the coucou was the count. You may well say: &#x27;Sour are the</p>
<p>curses of perversity.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar was very nearly changed to a pillar of salt; for, at this</p>
<p>revelation, his throat felt saltier than the sea.</p>
<p>&quot;And you, who talked to him about his wife&#x27;s lovers and his skin</p>
<p>diseases!&quot; said Mistigris, turning on Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;What does he mean?&quot; exclaimed the steward&#x27;s wife, gazing after the</p>
<p>two artists, who went away laughing at the expression of Oscar&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>Oscar remained dumb, confounded, stupefied, hearing nothing, though</p>
<p>Madame Moreau questioned him and shook him violently by his arm, which</p>
<p>she caught and squeezed. She gained nothing, however, and was forced</p>
<p>to leave him in the salon without an answer, for Rosalie appeared</p>
<p>again, to ask for linen and silver, and to beg she would go herself</p>
<p>and see that the multiplied orders of the count were executed. All the</p>
<p>household, together with the gardeners and the concierge and his wife,</p>
<p>were going and coming in a confusion that may readily be imagined. The</p>
<p>master had fallen upon his own house like a bombshell.</p>
<p>From the top of the hill near La Cave, where he left the coach, the</p>
<p>count had gone, by the path through the woods well-known to him, to</p>
<p>the house of his gamekeeper. The keeper was amazed when he saw his</p>
<p>real master.</p>
<p>&quot;Is Moreau here?&quot; said the count. &quot;I see his horse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, monseigneur; he means to go to Moulineaux before dinner, and he</p>
<p>has left his horse here while he went to the chateau to give a few</p>
<p>orders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you value your place,&quot; said the count, &quot;you will take that horse</p>
<p>and ride at once to Beaumont, where you will deliver to Monsieur</p>
<p>Margueron the note that I shall now write.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying the count entered the keeper&#x27;s lodge and wrote a line,</p>
<p>folding it in a way impossible to open without detection, and gave it</p>
<p>to the man as soon as he saw him in the saddle.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a word to any one,&quot; he said, &quot;and as for you, madame,&quot; he added</p>
<p>to the gamekeeper&#x27;s wife, &quot;if Moreau comes back for his horse, tell</p>
<p>him merely that I have taken it.&quot;</p>
<p>The count then crossed the park and entered the court-yard of the</p>
<p>chateau through the iron gates. However worn-out a man may be by the</p>
<p>wear and tear of public life, by his own emotions, by his own mistakes</p>
<p>and disappointments, the soul of any man able to love deeply at the</p>
<p>count&#x27;s age is still young and sensitive to treachery. Monsieur de</p>
<p>Serizy had felt such pain at the thought that Moreau had deceived him,</p>
<p>that even after hearing the conversation at Saint-Brice he thought him</p>
<p>less an accomplice of Leger and the notary than their tool. On the</p>
<p>threshold of the inn, and while that conversation was still going on,</p>
<p>he thought of pardoning his steward after giving him a good reproof.</p>
<p>Strange to say, the dishonesty of his confidential agent occupied his</p>
<p>mind as a mere episode from the moment when Oscar revealed his</p>
<p>infirmities. Secrets so carefully guarded could only have been</p>
<p>revealed by Moreau, who had, no doubt, laughed over the hidden</p>
<p>troubles of his benefactor with either Madame de Serizy&#x27;s former maid</p>
<p>or with the Aspasia of the Directory.</p>
<p>As he walked along the wood-path, this peer of France, this statesman,</p>
<p>wept as young men weep; he wept his last tears. All human feelings</p>
<p>were so cruelly hurt by one stroke that the usually calm man staggered</p>
<p>through his park like a wounded deer.</p>
<p>When Moreau arrived at the gamekeeper&#x27;s lodge and asked for his horse,</p>
<p>the keeper&#x27;s wife replied:--</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur le comte has just taken it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur le comte!&quot; cried Moreau. &quot;Whom do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, the Comte de Serizy, our master,&quot; she replied. &quot;He is probably</p>
<p>at the chateau by this time,&quot; she added, anxious to be rid of the</p>
<p>steward, who, unable to understand the meaning of her words, turned</p>
<p>back towards the chateau.</p>
<p>But he presently turned again and came back to the lodge, intending to</p>
<p>question the woman more closely; for he began to see something serious</p>
<p>in this secret arrival, and the apparently strange method of his</p>
<p>master&#x27;s return. But the wife of the gamekeeper, alarmed to find</p>
<p>herself caught in a vise between the count and his steward, had locked</p>
<p>herself into the house, resolved not to open to any but her husband.</p>
<p>Moreau, more and more uneasy, ran rapidly, in spite of his boots and</p>
<p>spurs, to the chateau, where he was told that the count was dressing.</p>
<p>&quot;Seven persons invited to dinner!&quot; cried Rosalie as soon as she saw</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Moreau then went through the offices to his own house. On his way he</p>
<p>met the poultry-girl, who was having an altercation with a handsome</p>
<p>young man.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur le comte particularly told me a colonel, an aide-de-camp of</p>
<p>Mina,&quot; insisted the girl.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not a colonel,&quot; replied Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;But isn&#x27;t your name Georges?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s all this?&quot; said the steward, intervening.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur, my name is Georges Marest; I am the son of a rich wholesale</p>
<p>ironmonger in the rue Saint-Martin; I come on business to Monsieur le</p>
<p>Comte de Serizy from Maitre Crottat, a notary, whose second clerk I</p>
<p>am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I,&quot; said the girl, &quot;am telling him that monseigneur said to me:</p>
<p>&#x27;There&#x27;ll come a colonel named Czerni-Georges, aide-de-camp to Mina;</p>
<p>he&#x27;ll come by Pierrotin&#x27;s coach; if he asks for me show him into the</p>
<p>waiting-room.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Evidently,&quot; said the clerk, &quot;the count is a traveller who came down</p>
<p>with us in Pierrotin&#x27;s coucou; if it hadn&#x27;t been for the politeness of</p>
<p>a young man he&#x27;d have come as a rabbit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A rabbit! in Pierrotin&#x27;s coucou!&quot; exclaimed Moreau and the poultry-</p>
<p>girl together.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure of it, from what this girl is now saying,&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;How so?&quot; asked the steward.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! that&#x27;s the point,&quot; cried the clerk. &quot;To hoax the travellers and</p>
<p>have a bit of fun I told them a lot of stuff about Egypt and Greece</p>
<p>and Spain. As I happened to be wearing spurs I have myself out for a</p>
<p>colonel of cavalry: pure nonsense!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; said Moreau, &quot;what did this traveller you take to be</p>
<p>Monsieur le comte look like?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Face like a brick,&quot; said Georges, &quot;hair snow-white, and black</p>
<p>eyebrows.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is he!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;m lost!&quot; exclaimed Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I chaffed him about his decorations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pooh! he&#x27;s a good fellow; you probably amused him. Come at once to</p>
<p>the chateau. I&#x27;ll go in and see his Excellency. Where did you say he</p>
<p>left the coach?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the top of the mountain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what to make of it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After all,&quot; thought Georges, &quot;though I did blague him, I didn&#x27;t say</p>
<p>anything insulting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why have you come here?&quot; asked the steward.</p>
<p>&quot;I have brought the deed of sale for the farm at Moulineaux, all ready</p>
<p>for signature.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good heavens!&quot; exclaimed the steward, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand one word of</p>
<p>all this!&quot;</p>
<p>Moreau felt his heart beat painfully when, after giving two raps on</p>
<p>his master&#x27;s door, he heard the words:--</p>
<p>&quot;Is that you, MONSIEUR Moreau?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, monseigneur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come in.&quot;</p>
<p>The count was now wearing a pair of white trousers and thin boots, a</p>
<p>white waistcoat and a black coat on which shone the grand cross of the</p>
<p>Legion upon the right breast, and fastened to a buttonhole on the left</p>
<p>was the order of the Golden Fleece hanging by a short gold chain. He</p>
<p>had arranged his hair himself, and had, no doubt, put himself in full</p>
<p>dress to do the honors of Presles to Monsieur Margueron; and,</p>
<p>possibly, to impress the good man&#x27;s mind with a prestige of grandeur.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, monsieur,&quot; said the count, who remained seated, leaving Moreau</p>
<p>to stand before him. &quot;We have not concluded that purchase from</p>
<p>Margueron.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He asks too much for the farm at the present moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why is he not coming to dinner as I requested?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monseigneur, he is ill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have just come from there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said the count, with a stern air which was really</p>
<p>terrible, &quot;what would you do with a man whom you trusted, if, after</p>
<p>seeing you dress wounds which you desired to keep secret from all the</p>
<p>world, he should reveal your misfortunes and laugh at your malady with</p>
<p>a strumpet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would thrash him for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if you discovered that he was also betraying your confidence and</p>
<p>robbing you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should endeavor to detect him, and send him to the galleys.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Moreau, listen to me. You have undoubtedly spoken of my</p>
<p>infirmities to Madame Clapart; you have laughed at her house, and with</p>
<p>her, over my attachment to the Comtesse de Serizy; for her son, little</p>
<p>Husson, told a number of circumstances relating to my medical</p>
<p>treatment, to travellers by a public conveyance in my presence, and</p>
<p>Heaven knows in what language! He dared to calumniate my wife. Besides</p>
<p>this, I learned from the lips of Pere Leger himself, who was in the</p>
<p>coach, of the plan laid by the notary at Beaumont and by you and by</p>
<p>himself in relation to Les Moulineaux. If you have been, as you say,</p>
<p>to Monsieur Margueron, it was to tell him to feign illness. He is so</p>
<p>little ill that he is coming here to dinner this evening. Now,</p>
<p>monsieur, I could pardon you having made two hundred and fifty</p>
<p>thousand francs out of your situation in seventeen years,--I can</p>
<p>understand that. You might each time have asked me for what you took,</p>
<p>and I would have given it to you; but let that pass. You have been,</p>
<p>notwithstanding this disloyalty, better than others, as I believe. But</p>
<p>that you, who knew my toil for our country, for France, you have seen</p>
<p>me giving night after night to the Emperor&#x27;s service, and working</p>
<p>eighteen hours of each twenty-four for months together, you who knew</p>
<p>my love for Madame de Serizy,--that you should have gossiped about me</p>
<p>before a boy! holding up my secrets and my affections to the ridicule</p>
<p>of a Madame Husson!--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monseigneur!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is unpardonable. To injure a man&#x27;s interest, why, that is nothing;</p>
<p>but to stab his heart!--Oh! you do not know what you have done!&quot;</p>
<p>The count put his head in his hands and was silent for some moments.</p>
<p>&quot;I leave you what you have gained,&quot; he said after a time, &quot;and I shall</p>
<p>forget you. For my sake, for my dignity, and for your honor, we will</p>
<p>part decently; for I cannot but remember even now what your father did</p>
<p>for mine. You will explain the duties of the stewardship in a proper</p>
<p>manner to Monsieur de Reybert, who succeeds you. Be calm, as I am.</p>
<p>Give no opportunity for fools to talk. Above all, let there be no</p>
<p>recrimination or petty meanness. Though you no longer possess my</p>
<p>confidence, endeavor to behave with the decorum of well-bred persons.</p>
<p>As for that miserable boy who has wounded me to death, I will not have</p>
<p>him sleep at Presles; send him to the inn; I will not answer for my</p>
<p>own temper if I see him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not deserve such gentleness, monseigneur,&quot; said Moreau, with</p>
<p>tears in his eyes. &quot;Yes, you are right; if I had been utterly</p>
<p>dishonest I should now be worth five hundred thousand francs instead</p>
<p>of half that sum. I offer to give you an account of my fortune, with</p>
<p>all its details. But let me tell you, monseigneur, that in talking of</p>
<p>you with Madame Clapart, it was never in derision; but, on the</p>
<p>contrary, to deplore your state, and to ask her for certain remedies,</p>
<p>not used by physicians, but known to the common people. I spoke of</p>
<p>your feelings before the boy, who was in his bed and, as I supposed,</p>
<p>asleep (it seems he must have been awake and listening to us), with</p>
<p>the utmost affection and respect. Alas! fate wills that indiscretions</p>
<p>be punished like crimes. But while accepting the results of your just</p>
<p>anger, I wish you to know what actually took place. It was, indeed,</p>
<p>from heart to heart that I spoke of you to Madame Clapart. As for my</p>
<p>wife, I have never said one word of these things--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enough,&quot; said the count, whose conviction was now complete; &quot;we are</p>
<p>not children. All is now irrevocable. Put your affairs and mine in</p>
<p>order. You can stay in the pavilion until October. Monsieur and Madame</p>
<p>de Reybert will lodge for the present in the chateau; endeavor to keep</p>
<p>on terms with them, like well-bred persons who hate each other, but</p>
<p>still keep up appearances.&quot;</p>
<p>The count and Moreau went downstairs; Moreau white as the count&#x27;s</p>
<p>hair, the count himself calm and dignified.</p>
<p>During the time this interview lasted the Beaumont coach, which left</p>
<p>Paris at one o&#x27;clock, had stopped before the gates of the chateau, and</p>
<p>deposited Maitre Crottat, the notary, who was shown, according to the</p>
<p>count&#x27;s orders, into the salon, where he found his clerk, extremely</p>
<p>subdued in manner, and the two painters, all three of them painfully</p>
<p>self-conscious and embarrassed. Monsieur de Reybert, a man of fifty,</p>
<p>with a crabbed expression of face, was also there, accompanied by old</p>
<p>Margueron and the notary of Beaumont, who held in his hand a bundle of</p>
<p>deeds and other papers.</p>
<p>When these various personages saw the count in evening dress, and</p>
<p>wearing his orders, Georges Marest had a slight sensation of colic,</p>
<p>Joseph Bridau quivered, but Mistigris, who was conscious of being in</p>
<p>his Sunday clothes, and had, moreover, nothing on his conscience,</p>
<p>remarked, in a sufficiently loud tone:--</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he looks a great deal better like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Little scamp,&quot; said the count, catching him by the ear, &quot;we are both</p>
<p>in the decoration business. I hope you recognize your own work, my</p>
<p>dear Schinner,&quot; he added, pointing to the ceiling of the salon.</p>
<p>&quot;Monseigneur,&quot; replied the artist, &quot;I did wrong to take such a</p>
<p>celebrated name out of mere bravado; but this day will oblige me to do</p>
<p>fine things for you, and so bring credit on my own name of Joseph</p>
<p>Bridau.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You took up my defence,&quot; said the count, hastily; &quot;and I hope you</p>
<p>will give me the pleasure of dining with me, as well as my lively</p>
<p>friend Mistigris.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your Excellency doesn&#x27;t know to what you expose yourself,&quot; said the</p>
<p>saucy rapin; &quot;&#x27;facilis descensus victuali,&#x27; as we say at the Black</p>
<p>Hen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bridau!&quot; exclaimed the minister, struck by a sudden thought. &quot;Are you</p>
<p>any relation to one of the most devoted toilers under the Empire, the</p>
<p>head of a bureau, who fell a victim to his zeal?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His son, monseigneur,&quot; replied Joseph, bowing.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you are most welcome here,&quot; said the count, taking Bridau&#x27;s hand</p>
<p>in both of his. &quot;I knew your father, and you can count on me as on--on</p>
<p>an uncle in America,&quot; added the count, laughing. &quot;But you are too</p>
<p>young to have pupils of your own; to whom does Mistigris really</p>
<p>belong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To my friend Schinner, who lent him to me,&quot; said Joseph. &quot;Mistigris&#x27;</p>
<p>name is Leon de Lora. Monseigneur, if you knew my father, will you</p>
<p>deign to think of his other son, who is now accused of plotting</p>
<p>against the State, and is soon to be tried before the Court of Peers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! that&#x27;s true,&quot; said the count. &quot;Yes, I will think about it, be</p>
<p>sure of that. As for Colonel Czerni-Georges, the friend of Ali Pacha,</p>
<p>and Mina&#x27;s aide-de-camp--&quot; he continued, walking up to Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;He! why that&#x27;s my second clerk!&quot; cried Crottat.</p>
<p>&quot;You are quite mistaken, Maitre Crottat,&quot; said the count, assuming a</p>
<p>stern air. &quot;A clerk who intends to be a notary does not leave</p>
<p>important deeds in a diligence at the mercy of other travellers;</p>
<p>neither does he spend twenty francs between Paris and Moisselles; or</p>
<p>expose himself to be arrested as a deserter--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monseigneur,&quot; said Georges Marest, &quot;I may have amused myself with the</p>
<p>bourgeois in the diligence, but--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let his Excellency finish what he was saying,&quot; said the notary,</p>
<p>digging his elbow into his clerk&#x27;s ribs.</p>
<p>&quot;A notary,&quot; continued the count, &quot;ought to practise discretion,</p>
<p>shrewdness, caution from the start; he should be incapable of such a</p>
<p>blunder as taking a peer of France for a tallow-chandler--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am willing to be blamed for my faults,&quot; said Georges; &quot;but I never</p>
<p>left my deeds at the mercy of--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now you are committing the fault of contradicting the word of a</p>
<p>minister of State, a gentleman, an old man, and a client,&quot; said the</p>
<p>count. &quot;Give me that deed of sale.&quot;</p>
<p>Georges turned over and over the papers in his portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;That will do; don&#x27;t disarrange those papers,&quot; said the count, taking</p>
<p>the deed from his pocket. &quot;Here is what you are looking for.&quot;</p>
<p>Crottat turned the paper back and forth, so astonished was he at</p>
<p>receiving it from the hands of his client.</p>
<p>&quot;What does this mean, monsieur?&quot; he said, finally, to Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;If I had not taken it,&quot; said the count, &quot;Pere Leger,--who is by no</p>
<p>means such a ninny as you thought him from his questions about</p>
<p>agriculture, by which he showed that he attended to his own business,</p>
<p>--Pere Leger might have seized that paper and guessed my purpose. You</p>
<p>must give me the pleasure of dining with me, but one on condition,--</p>
<p>that of describing, as you promised, the execution of the Muslim of</p>
<p>Smyrna, and you must also finish the memoirs of some client which you</p>
<p>have certainly read to be so well informed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Schlague for blague!&quot; said Leon de Lora, in a whisper, to Joseph</p>
<p>Bridau.</p>
<p>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said the count to the two notaries and Messieurs</p>
<p>Margueron and de Reybert, &quot;let us go into the next room and conclude</p>
<p>this business before dinner, because, as my friend Mistigris would</p>
<p>say: &#x27;Qui esurit constentit.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he is very good-natured,&quot; said Leon de Lora to Georges Marest,</p>
<p>when the count had left the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, HE may be, but my master isn&#x27;t,&quot; said Georges, &quot;and he will</p>
<p>request me to go and blaguer somewhere else.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind, you like travel,&quot; said Bridau.</p>
<p>&quot;What a dressing that boy will get from Monsieur and Madame Moreau!&quot;</p>
<p>cried Mistigris.</p>
<p>&quot;Little idiot!&quot; said Georges. &quot;If it hadn&#x27;t been for him the count</p>
<p>would have been amused. Well, anyhow, the lesson is a good one; and if</p>
<p>ever again I am caught bragging in a public coach--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is a stupid thing to do,&quot; said Joseph Bridau.</p>
<p>&quot;And common,&quot; added Mistigris. &quot;&#x27;Vulgarity is the brother of</p>
<p>pretension.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>While the matter of the sale was being settled between Monsieur</p>
<p>Margueron and the Comte de Serizy, assisted by their respective</p>
<p>notaries in presence of Monsieur de Reybert, the ex-steward walked</p>
<p>with slow steps to his own house. There he entered the salon and sat</p>
<p>down without noticing anything. Little Husson, who was present,</p>
<p>slipped into a corner, out of sight, so much did the livid face of his</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s friend alarm him.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh! my friend!&quot; said Estelle, coming into the room, somewhat tired</p>
<p>with what she had been doing. &quot;What is the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, we are lost,--lost beyond recovery. I am no longer steward</p>
<p>of Presles, no longer in the count&#x27;s confidence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pere Leger, who was in Pierrotin&#x27;s coach, told the count all about</p>
<p>the affair of Les Moulineaux. But that is not the thing that has cost</p>
<p>me his favor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oscar spoke ill of the countess, and he told about the count&#x27;s</p>
<p>diseases.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oscar!&quot; cried Madame Moreau. &quot;Ah! my dear, your sin has found you</p>
<p>out. It was well worth while to warm that young serpent in your bosom.</p>
<p>How often I have told you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; said Moreau, in a strained voice.</p>
<p>At this moment Estelle and her husband discovered Oscar cowering in</p>
<p>his corner. Moreau swooped down on the luckless lad like a hawk on its</p>
<p>prey, took him by the collar of the coat and dragged him to the light</p>
<p>of a window. &quot;Speak! what did you say to monseigneur in that coach?</p>
<p>What demon let loose your tongue, you who keep a doltish silence</p>
<p>whenever I speak to you? What did you do it for?&quot; cried the steward,</p>
<p>with frightful violence.</p>
<p>Too bewildered to weep, Oscar was dumb and motionless as a statue.</p>
<p>&quot;Come with me and beg his Excellency&#x27;s pardon,&quot; said Moreau.</p>
<p>&quot;As if his Excellency cares for a little toad like that!&quot; cried the</p>
<p>furious Estelle.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, I say, to the chateau,&quot; repeated Moreau.</p>
<p>Oscar dropped like an inert mass to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Come!&quot; cried Moreau, his anger increasing at every instant.</p>
<p>&quot;No! no! mercy!&quot; cried Oscar, who could not bring himself to submit to</p>
<p>a torture that seemed to him worse than death.</p>
<p>Moreau then took the lad by his coat, and dragged him, as he might a</p>
<p>dead body, through the yards, which rang with the boy&#x27;s outcries and</p>
<p>sobs. He pulled him up the portico, and, with an arm that fury made</p>
<p>powerful, he flung him, bellowing, and rigid as a pole, into the</p>
<p>salon, at the very feet of the count, who, having completed the</p>
<p>purchase of Les Moulineaux, was about to leave the salon for the</p>
<p>dining-room with his guests.</p>
<p>&quot;On your knees, wretched boy! and ask pardon of him who gave food to</p>
<p>your mind by obtaining your scholarship.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar, his face to the ground, was foaming with rage, and did not say</p>
<p>a word. The spectators of the scene were shocked. Moreau seemed no</p>
<p>longer in his senses; his face was crimson with injected blood.</p>
<p>&quot;This young man is a mere lump of vanity,&quot; said the count, after</p>
<p>waiting a moment for Oscar&#x27;s excuses. &quot;A proud man humiliates himself</p>
<p>because he sees there is grandeur in a certain self-abasement. I am</p>
<p>afraid that you will never make much of that lad.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, his Excellency passed on. Moreau took Oscar home with him;</p>
<p>and on the way gave orders that the horses should immediately be put</p>
<p>to Madame Moreau&#x27;s caleche.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>A MOTHER&#x27;S TRIALS</p>
<p>While the horses were being harnessed, Moreau wrote the following</p>
<p>letter to Madame Clapart:--</p>
<p>My dear,--Oscar has ruined me. During his journey in Pierrotin&#x27;s</p>
<p>coach, he spoke of Madame de Serizy&#x27;s behavior to his Excellency,</p>
<p>who was travelling incognito, and actually told, to himself, the</p>
<p>secret of his terrible malady. After dismissing me from my</p>
<p>stewardship, the count told me not to let Oscar sleep at Presles,</p>
<p>but to send him away immediately. Therefore, to obey his orders,</p>
<p>the horses are being harnessed at this moment to my wife&#x27;s</p>
<p>carriage, and Brochon, my stable-man, will take the miserable</p>
<p>child to you to-night.</p>
<p>We are, my wife and I, in a distress of mind which you may perhaps</p>
<p>imagine, though I cannot describe it to you. I will see you in a</p>
<p>few days, for I must take another course. I have three children,</p>
<p>and I ought to consider their future. At present I do not know</p>
<p>what to do; but I shall certainly endeavor to make the count aware</p>
<p>of what seventeen years of the life of a man like myself is worth.</p>
<p>Owning at the present moment about two hundred and fifty thousand</p>
<p>francs, I want to raise myself to a fortune which may some day</p>
<p>make me the equal of his Excellency. At this moment I feel within</p>
<p>me the power to move mountains and vanquish insurmountable</p>
<p>difficulties. What a lever is such a scene of bitter humiliation</p>
<p>as I have just passed through! Whose blood has Oscar in his veins?</p>
<p>His conduct has been that of a blockhead; up to this moment when I</p>
<p>write to you, he has not said a word nor answered, even by a sign,</p>
<p>the questions my wife and I have put to him. Will he become an</p>
<p>idiot? or is he one already? Dear friend, why did you not instruct</p>
<p>him as to his behavior before you sent him to me? How many</p>
<p>misfortunes you would have spared me, had you brought him here</p>
<p>yourself as I begged you to do. If Estelle alarmed you, you might</p>
<p>have stayed at Moisselles. However, the thing is done, and there</p>
<p>is no use talking about it.</p>
<p>Adieu; I shall see you soon.</p>
<p>Your devoted servant and friend,</p>
<p>Moreau</p>
<p>At eight o&#x27;clock that evening, Madame Clapart, just returned from a</p>
<p>walk she had taken with her husband, was knitting winter socks for</p>
<p>Oscar, by the light of a single candle. Monsieur Clapart was expecting</p>
<p>a friend named Poiret, who often came in to play dominoes, for never</p>
<p>did he allow himself to spend an evening at a cafe. In spite of the</p>
<p>prudent economy to which his small means forced him, Clapart would not</p>
<p>have answered for his temperance amid a luxury of food and in presence</p>
<p>of the usual guests of a cafe whose inquisitive observation would have</p>
<p>piqued him.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid Poiret came while we were out,&quot; said Clapart to his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, no, my friend; the portress would have told us so when we came</p>
<p>in,&quot; replied Madame Clapart.</p>
<p>&quot;She may have forgotten it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What makes you think so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time she has forgotten things for us,--for</p>
<p>God knows how people without means are treated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the poor woman, to change the conversation and escape</p>
<p>Clapart&#x27;s cavilling, &quot;Oscar must be at Presles by this time. How he</p>
<p>will enjoy that fine house and the beautiful park.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! yes,&quot; snarled Clapart, &quot;you expect fine things of him; but, mark</p>
<p>my words, there&#x27;ll be squabbles wherever he goes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you never cease to find fault with that poor child?&quot; said the</p>
<p>mother. &quot;What has he done to you? If some day we should live at our</p>
<p>ease, we may owe it all to him; he has such a good heart--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our bones will be jelly long before that fellow makes his way in the</p>
<p>world,&quot; cried Clapart. &quot;You don&#x27;t know your own child; he is</p>
<p>conceited, boastful, deceitful, lazy, incapable of--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#x27;t you go to meet Poiret?&quot; said the poor mother, struck to the</p>
<p>heart by the diatribe she had brought upon herself.</p>
<p>&quot;A boy who has never won a prize at school!&quot; continued Clapart.</p>
<p>To bourgeois eyes, the obtaining of school prizes means the certainty</p>
<p>of a fine future for the fortunate child.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you win any?&quot; asked his wife. &quot;Oscar stood second in philosophy.&quot;</p>
<p>This remark imposed silence for a moment on Clapart; but presently he</p>
<p>began again.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, Madame Moreau hates him like poison, you know why. She&#x27;ll</p>
<p>try to set her husband against him. Oscar to step into his shoes as</p>
<p>steward of Presles! Why he&#x27;d have to learn agriculture, and know how</p>
<p>to survey.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He can learn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He--that pussy cat! I&#x27;ll bet that if he does get a place down there,</p>
<p>it won&#x27;t be a week before he does some doltish thing which will make</p>
<p>the count dismiss him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good God! how can you be so bitter against a poor child who is full</p>
<p>of good qualities, sweet-tempered as an angel, incapable of doing harm</p>
<p>to any one, no matter who.&quot;</p>
<p>Just then the cracking of a postilion&#x27;s whip and the noise of a</p>
<p>carriage stopping before the house was heard, this arrival having</p>
<p>apparently put the whole street into a commotion. Clapart, who heard</p>
<p>the opening of many windows, looked out himself to see what was</p>
<p>happening.</p>
<p>&quot;They have sent Oscar back to you in a post-chaise,&quot; he cried, in a</p>
<p>tone of satisfaction, though in truth he felt inwardly uneasy.</p>
<p>&quot;Good heavens! what can have happened to him?&quot; cried the poor mother,</p>
<p>trembling like a leaf shaken by the autumn wind.</p>
<p>Brochon here came up, followed by Oscar and Poiret.</p>
<p>&quot;What has happened?&quot; repeated the mother, addressing the stable-man.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know, but Monsieur Moreau is no longer steward of Presles,</p>
<p>and they say your son has caused it. His Excellency ordered that he</p>
<p>should be sent home to you. Here&#x27;s a letter from poor Monsieur Moreau,</p>
<p>madame, which will tell you all. You never saw a man so changed in a</p>
<p>single day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Clapart, two glasses of wine for the postilion and for monsieur!&quot;</p>
<p>cried the mother, flinging herself into a chair that she might read</p>
<p>the fatal letter. &quot;Oscar,&quot; she said, staggering towards her bed, &quot;do</p>
<p>you want to kill your mother? After all the cautions I gave you this</p>
<p>morning--&quot;</p>
<p>She did not end her sentence, for she fainted from distress of mind.</p>
<p>When she came to herself she heard her husband saying to Oscar, as he</p>
<p>shook him by the arm:--</p>
<p>&quot;Will you answer me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go to bed, monsieur,&quot; she said to her son. &quot;Let him alone, Monsieur</p>
<p>Clapart. Don&#x27;t drive him out of his senses; he is frightfully</p>
<p>changed.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar did not hear his mother&#x27;s last words; he had slipped away to bed</p>
<p>the instant that he got the order.</p>
<p>Those who remember their youth will not be surprised to learn that</p>
<p>after a day so filled with events and emotions, Oscar, in spite of the</p>
<p>enormity of his offences, slept the sleep of the just. The next day he</p>
<p>did not find the world so changed as he thought it; he was surprised</p>
<p>to be very hungry,--he who the night before had regarded himself as</p>
<p>unworthy to live. He had only suffered mentally. At his age mental</p>
<p>impressions succeed each other so rapidly that the last weakens its</p>
<p>predecessor, however deeply the first may have been cut in. For this</p>
<p>reason corporal punishment, though philanthropists are deeply opposed</p>
<p>to it in these days, becomes necessary in certain cases for certain</p>
<p>children. It is, moreover, the most natural form of retribution, for</p>
<p>Nature herself employs it; she uses pain to impress a lasting memory</p>
<p>of her precepts. If to the shame of the preceding evening, unhappily</p>
<p>too transient, the steward had joined some personal chastisement,</p>
<p>perhaps the lesson might have been complete. The discernment with</p>
<p>which such punishment needs to be administered is the greatest</p>
<p>argument against it. Nature is never mistaken; but the teacher is, and</p>
<p>frequently.</p>
<p>Madame Clapart took pains to send her husband out, so that she might</p>
<p>be alone with her son the next morning. She was in a state to excite</p>
<p>pity. Her eyes, worn with tears; her face, weary with the fatigue of a</p>
<p>sleepless night; her feeble voice,--in short, everything about her</p>
<p>proved an excess of suffering she could not have borne a second time,</p>
<p>and appealed to sympathy.</p>
<p>When Oscar entered the room she signed to him to sit down beside her,</p>
<p>and reminded him in a gentle but grieved voice of the benefits they</p>
<p>had so constantly received from the steward of Presles. She told him</p>
<p>that they had lived, especially for the last six years, on the</p>
<p>delicate charity of Monsieur Moreau; and that Monsieur Clapart&#x27;s</p>
<p>salary, also the &quot;demi-bourse,&quot; or scholarship, by which he (Oscar)</p>
<p>had obtained an education, was due to the Comte de Serizy. Most of</p>
<p>this would now cease. Monsieur Clapart, she said, had no claim to a</p>
<p>pension,--his period of service not being long enough to obtain one.</p>
<p>On the day when he was no longer able to keep his place, what would</p>
<p>become of them?</p>
<p>&quot;For myself,&quot; she said, &quot;by nursing the sick, or living as a</p>
<p>housekeeper in some great family, I could support myself and Monsieur</p>
<p>Clapart; but you, Oscar, what could you do? You have no means, and you</p>
<p>must earn some, for you must live. There are but four careers for a</p>
<p>young man like you,--commerce, government employment, the licensed</p>
<p>professions, or military service. All forms of commerce need capital,</p>
<p>and we have none to give you. In place of capital, a young man can</p>
<p>only give devotion and his capacity. But commerce also demands the</p>
<p>utmost discretion, and your conduct yesterday proves that you lack it.</p>
<p>To enter a government office, you must go through a long probation by</p>
<p>the help of influence, and you have just alienated the only protector</p>
<p>that we had,--a most powerful one. Besides, suppose you were to meet</p>
<p>with some extraordinary help, by which a young man makes his way</p>
<p>promptly either in business or in the public employ, where could you</p>
<p>find the money to live and clothe yourself during the time that you</p>
<p>are learning your employment?&quot;</p>
<p>Here the mother wandered, like other women, into wordy lamentation:</p>
<p>What should she do now to feed the family, deprived of the benefits</p>
<p>Moreau&#x27;s stewardship had enabled him to send her from Presles? Oscar</p>
<p>had overthrown his benefactor&#x27;s prosperity! As commerce and a</p>
<p>government clerkship were now impossible, there remained only the</p>
<p>professions of notary and lawyer, either barristers or solicitors, and</p>
<p>sheriffs. But for those he must study at least three years, and pay</p>
<p>considerable sums for entrance fees, examinations, certificates, and</p>
<p>diplomas; and here again the question of maintenance presented itself.</p>
<p>&quot;Oscar,&quot; she said, in conclusion, &quot;in you I had put all my pride, all</p>
<p>my life. In accepting for myself an unhappy old age, I fastened my</p>
<p>eyes on you; I saw you with the prospect of a fine career, and I</p>
<p>imagined you succeeding in it. That thought, that hope, gave me</p>
<p>courage to face the privations I have endured for six years in order</p>
<p>to carry you through school, where you have cost me, in spite of the</p>
<p>scholarship, between seven and eight hundred francs a year. Now that</p>
<p>my hope is vanishing, your future terrifies me. I cannot take one</p>
<p>penny from Monsieur Clapart&#x27;s salary for my son. What can you do? You</p>
<p>are not strong enough to mathematics to enter any of the technical</p>
<p>schools; and, besides, where could I get the three thousand francs</p>
<p>board-money which they extract? This is life as it is, my child. You</p>
<p>are eighteen, you are strong. Enlist in the army; it is your only</p>
<p>means, that I can see, to earn your bread.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar knew as yet nothing whatever of life. Like all children who have</p>
<p>been kept from a knowledge of the trials and poverty of the home, he</p>
<p>was ignorant of the necessity of earning his living. The word</p>
<p>&quot;commerce&quot; presented no idea whatever to his mind; &quot;public employment&quot;</p>
<p>said almost as little, for he saw no results of it. He listened,</p>
<p>therefore, with a submissive air, which he tried to make humble, to</p>
<p>his mother&#x27;s exhortations, but they were lost in the void, and did not</p>
<p>reach his mind. Nevertheless, the word &quot;army,&quot; the thought of being a</p>
<p>soldier, and the sight of his mother&#x27;s tears did at last make him cry.</p>
<p>No sooner did Madame Clapart see the drops coursing down his cheeks</p>
<p>than she felt herself helpless, and, like most mothers in such cases,</p>
<p>she began the peroration which terminates these scenes,--scenes in</p>
<p>which they suffer their own anguish and that of their children also.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Oscar, PROMISE me that you will be more discreet in future,--</p>
<p>that you will not talk heedlessly any more, but will strive to repress</p>
<p>your silly vanity,&quot; et cetera, et cetera.</p>
<p>Oscar of course promised all his mother asked him to promise, and</p>
<p>then, after gently drawing him to her, Madame Clapart ended by kissing</p>
<p>him to console him for being scolded.</p>
<p>&quot;In future,&quot; she said, &quot;you will listen to your mother, and will</p>
<p>follow her advice; for a mother can give nothing but good counsel to</p>
<p>her child. We will go and see your uncle Cardot; that is our last</p>
<p>hope. Cardot owed a great deal to your father, who gave him his</p>
<p>sister, Mademoiselle Husson, with an enormous dowry for those days,</p>
<p>which enabled him to make a large fortune in the silk trade. I think</p>
<p>he might, perhaps, place you with Monsieur Camusot, his successor and</p>
<p>son-in-law, in the rue des Bourdonnais. But, you see, your uncle</p>
<p>Cardot has four children. He gave his establishment, the Cocon d&#x27;Or,</p>
<p>to his eldest daughter, Madame Camusot; and though Camusot has</p>
<p>millions, he has also four children by two wives; and, besides, he</p>
<p>scarcely knows of our existence. Cardot has married his second</p>
<p>daughter, Mariane, to Monsieur Protez, of the firm of Protez and</p>
<p>Chiffreville. The practice of his eldest son, the notary, cost him</p>
<p>four hundred thousand francs; and he has just put his second son,</p>
<p>Joseph, into the drug business of Matifat. So you see, your uncle</p>
<p>Cardot has many reasons not to take an interest in you, whom he sees</p>
<p>only four times a year. He has never come to call upon me here, though</p>
<p>he was ready enough to visit me at Madame Mere&#x27;s when he wanted to</p>
<p>sell his silks to the Emperor, the imperial highnesses, and all the</p>
<p>great people at court. But now the Camusots have turned ultras. The</p>
<p>eldest son of Camusot&#x27;s first wife married a daughter of one of the</p>
<p>king&#x27;s ushers. The world is mighty hump-backed when it stoops!</p>
<p>However, it was a clever thing to do, for the Cocon d&#x27;Or has the</p>
<p>custom of the present court as it had that of the Emperor. But to-</p>
<p>morrow we will go and see your uncle Cardot, and I hope that you will</p>
<p>endeavor to behave properly; for, as I said before, and I repeat it,</p>
<p>that is our last hope.&quot;</p>
<p>Monsieur Jean-Jerome-Severin Cardot had been a widower six years. As</p>
<p>head-clerk of the Cocon d&#x27;Or, one of the oldest firms in Paris, he had</p>
<p>bought the establishment in 1793, at a time when the heads of the</p>
<p>house were ruined by the maximum; and the money of Mademoiselle</p>
<p>Husson&#x27;s dowry had enabled him to do this, and so make a fortune that</p>
<p>was almost colossal in ten years. To establish his children richly</p>
<p>during his lifetime, he had conceived the idea of buying an annuity</p>
<p>for himself and his wife with three hundred thousand francs, which</p>
<p>gave him an income of thirty thousand francs a year. He then divided</p>
<p>his capital into three shares of four hundred thousand francs each,</p>
<p>which he gave to three of his children,--the Cocon d&#x27;Or, given to his</p>
<p>eldest daughter on her marriage, being the equivalent of a fourth</p>
<p>share. Thus the worthy man, who was now nearly seventy years old,</p>
<p>could spend his thirty thousand a year as he pleased, without feeling</p>
<p>that he injured the prospects of his children, all finely provided</p>
<p>for, whose attentions and proofs of affection were, moreover, not</p>
<p>prompted by self-interest.</p>
<p>Uncle Cardot lived at Belleville, in one of the first houses above the</p>
<p>Courtille. He there occupied, on the first floor, an apartment</p>
<p>overlooking the valley of the Seine, with a southern exposure, and the</p>
<p>exclusive enjoyment of a large garden, for the sum of a thousand</p>
<p>francs a year. He troubled himself not at all about the three or four</p>
<p>other tenants of the same vast country-house. Certain, through a long</p>
<p>lease, of ending his days there, he lived rather plainly, served by an</p>
<p>old cook and the former maid of the late Madame Cardot,--both of whom</p>
<p>expected to reap an annuity of some six hundred francs apiece on the</p>
<p>old man&#x27;s death. These two women took the utmost care of him, and were</p>
<p>all the more interested in doing so because no one was ever less fussy</p>
<p>or less fault-finding than he. The apartment, furnished by the late</p>
<p>Madame Cardot, had remained in the same condition for the last six</p>
<p>years,--the old man being perfectly contented with it. He spent in all</p>
<p>not more than three thousand francs a year there; for he dined in</p>
<p>Paris five days in the week, and returned home at midnight in a</p>
<p>hackney-coach, which belonged to an establishment at Courtille. The</p>
<p>cook had only her master&#x27;s breakfast to provide on those days. This</p>
<p>was served at eleven o&#x27;clock; after that he dressed and perfumed</p>
<p>himself, and departed for Paris. Usually, a bourgeois gives notice in</p>
<p>the household if he dines out; old Cardot, on the contrary, gave</p>
<p>notice when he dined at home.</p>
<p>This little old man--fat, rosy, squat, and strong--always looked, in</p>
<p>popular speech, as if he had stepped from a bandbox. He appeared in</p>
<p>black silk stockings, breeches of &quot;pou-de-soie&quot; (paduasoy), a white</p>
<p>pique waistcoat, dazzling shirt-front, a blue-bottle coat, violet silk</p>
<p>gloves, gold buckles to his shoes and his breeches, and, lastly, a</p>
<p>touch of powder and a little queue tied with black ribbon. His face</p>
<p>was remarkable for a pair of eyebrows as thick as bushes, beneath</p>
<p>which sparkled his gray eyes; and for a square nose, thick and long,</p>
<p>which gave him somewhat the air of the abbes of former times. His</p>
<p>countenance did not belie him. Pere Cardot belonged to that race of</p>
<p>lively Gerontes which is now disappearing rapidly, though it once</p>
<p>served as Turcarets to the comedies and tales of the eighteenth</p>
<p>century. Uncle Cardot always said &quot;Fair lady,&quot; and he placed in their</p>
<p>carriages, and otherwise paid attention to those women whom he saw</p>
<p>without protectors; he &quot;placed himself at their disposition,&quot; as he</p>
<p>said, in his chivalrous way.</p>
<p>But beneath his calm air and his snowy poll he concealed an old age</p>
<p>almost wholly given up to mere pleasure. Among men he openly professed</p>
<p>epicureanism, and gave himself the license of free talk. He had seen</p>
<p>no harm in the devotion of his son-in-law, Camusot, to Mademoiselle</p>
<p>Coralie, for he himself was secretly the Mecaenas of Mademoiselle</p>
<p>Florentine, the first danseuse at the Gaiete. But this life and these</p>
<p>opinions never appeared in his own home, nor in his external conduct</p>
<p>before the world. Uncle Cardot, grave and polite, was thought to be</p>
<p>somewhat cold, so much did he affect decorum; a &quot;devote&quot; would have</p>
<p>called him a hypocrite.</p>
<p>The worthy old gentleman hated priests; he belonged to that great</p>
<p>flock of ninnies who subscribed to the &quot;Constitutionnel,&quot; and was much</p>
<p>concerned about &quot;refusals to bury.&quot; He adored Voltaire, though his</p>
<p>preferences were really for Piron, Vade, and Colle. Naturally, he</p>
<p>admired Beranger, whom he wittily called the &quot;grandfather of the</p>
<p>religion of Lisette.&quot; His daughters, Madame Camusot and Madame Protez,</p>
<p>and his two sons would, to use a popular expression, have been</p>
<p>flabbergasted if any one had explained to them what their father meant</p>
<p>by &quot;singing la Mere Godichon.&quot;</p>
<p>This long-headed parent had never mentioned his income to his</p>
<p>children, who, seeing that he lived in a cheap way, reflected that he</p>
<p>had deprived himself of his property for their sakes, and, therefore,</p>
<p>redoubled their attentions and tenderness. In fact, he would sometimes</p>
<p>say to his sons:--</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t lose your property; remember, I have none to leave you.&quot;</p>
<p>Camusot, in whom he recognized a certain likeness to his own nature,</p>
<p>and whom he liked enough to make a sharer in his secret pleasures,</p>
<p>alone knew of the thirty thousand a year annuity. But Camusot approved</p>
<p>of the old man&#x27;s ethics, and thought that, having made the happiness</p>
<p>of his children and nobly fulfilled his duty by them, he now had a</p>
<p>right to end his life jovially.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you see, my friend,&quot; said the former master of the Cocon d&#x27;Or,</p>
<p>&quot;I might re-marry. A young woman would give me more children. Well,</p>
<p>Florentine doesn&#x27;t cost me what a wife would; neither does she bore</p>
<p>me; and she won&#x27;t give me children to lessen your property.&quot;</p>
<p>Camusot considered that Pere Cardot gave expression to a high sense of</p>
<p>family duty in these words; he regarded him as an admirable father-in-</p>
<p>law.</p>
<p>&quot;He knows,&quot; thought he, &quot;how to unite the interests of his children</p>
<p>with the pleasures which old age naturally desires after the worries</p>
<p>of business life.&quot;</p>
<p>Neither the Cardots, nor the Camusots, nor the Protez knew anything of</p>
<p>the ways of life of their aunt Clapart. The family intercourse was</p>
<p>restricted to the sending of notes of &quot;faire part&quot; on the occasion of</p>
<p>deaths and marriages, and cards at the New Year. The proud Madame</p>
<p>Clapart would never have brought herself to seek them were it not for</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s interests, and because of her friendship for Moreau, the only</p>
<p>person who had been faithful to her in misfortune. She had never</p>
<p>annoyed old Cardot by her visits, or her importunities, but she held</p>
<p>to him as to a hope, and always went to see him once every three</p>
<p>months and talked to him of Oscar, the nephew of the late respectable</p>
<p>Madame Cardot; and she took the boy to call upon him three times</p>
<p>during each vacation. At each of these visits the old gentleman had</p>
<p>given Oscar a dinner at the Cadran-Bleu, taking him, afterwards, to</p>
<p>the Gaiete, and returning him safely to the rue de la Cerisaie. On one</p>
<p>occasion, having given the boy an entirely new suit of clothes, he</p>
<p>added the silver cup and fork and spoon required for his school</p>
<p>outfit.</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s mother endeavored to impress the old gentleman with the idea</p>
<p>that his nephew cherished him, and she constantly referred to the cup</p>
<p>and the fork and spoon and to the beautiful suit of clothes, though</p>
<p>nothing was then left of the latter but the waistcoat. But such little</p>
<p>arts did Oscar more harm than good when practised on so sly an old fox</p>
<p>as uncle Cardot. The latter had never much liked his departed wife, a</p>
<p>tall, spare, red-haired woman; he was also aware of the circumstances</p>
<p>of the late Husson&#x27;s marriage with Oscar&#x27;s mother, and without in the</p>
<p>least condemning her, he knew very well that Oscar was a posthumous</p>
<p>child. His nephew, therefore, seemed to him to have no claims on the</p>
<p>Cardot family. But Madame Clapart, like all women who concentrate</p>
<p>their whole being into the sentiment of motherhood, did not put</p>
<p>herself in Cardot&#x27;s place and see the matter from his point of view;</p>
<p>she thought he must certainly be interested in so sweet a child, who</p>
<p>bore the maiden name of his late wife.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said old Cardot&#x27;s maid-servant, coming out to him as he</p>
<p>walked about the garden while awaiting his breakfast, after his</p>
<p>hairdresser had duly shaved him and powdered his queue, &quot;the mother of</p>
<p>your nephew, Oscar, is here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-day, fair lady,&quot; said the old man, bowing to Madame Clapart, and</p>
<p>wrapping his white pique dressing-gown about him. &quot;Hey, hey! how this</p>
<p>little fellow grows,&quot; he added, taking Oscar by the ear.</p>
<p>&quot;He has finished school, and he regretted so much that his dear uncle</p>
<p>was not present at the distribution of the Henri IV. prizes, at which</p>
<p>he was named. The name of Husson, which, let us hope, he will bear</p>
<p>worthily, was proclaimed--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The deuce it was!&quot; exclaimed the little old man, stopping short.</p>
<p>Madame Clapart, Oscar, and he were walking along a terrace flanked by</p>
<p>oranges, myrtles, and pomegranates. &quot;And what did he get?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The fourth rank in philosophy,&quot; replied the mother proudly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! oh!&quot; cried uncle Cardot, &quot;the rascal has a good deal to do to</p>
<p>make up for lost time; for the fourth rank in philosophy, well, IT</p>
<p>ISN&#x27;T PERU, you know! You will stay and breakfast with me?&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;We are at your orders,&quot; replied Madame Clapart. &quot;Ah! my dear Monsieur</p>
<p>Cardot, what happiness it is for fathers and mothers when their</p>
<p>children make a good start in life! In this respect--indeed, in all</p>
<p>others,&quot; she added, catching herself up, &quot;you are one of the most</p>
<p>fortunate fathers I have ever known. Under your virtuous son-in-law</p>
<p>and your amiable daughter, the Cocon d&#x27;Or continues to be the greatest</p>
<p>establishment of its kind in Paris. And here&#x27;s your eldest son, for</p>
<p>the last ten years at the head of a fine practice and married to</p>
<p>wealth. And you have such charming little granddaughters! You are, as</p>
<p>it were, the head of four great families. Leave us, Oscar; go and look</p>
<p>at the garden, but don&#x27;t touch the flowers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, he&#x27;s eighteen years old!&quot; said uncle Cardot, smiling at this</p>
<p>injunction, which made an infant of Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Alas, yes, he is eighteen, my good Monsieur Cardot; and after</p>
<p>bringing him so far, sound and healthy in mind and body, neither bow-</p>
<p>legged nor crooked, after sacrificing everything to give him an</p>
<p>education, it would be hard if I could not see him on the road to</p>
<p>fortune.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That Monsieur Moreau who got him the scholarship will be sure to look</p>
<p>after his career,&quot; said uncle Cardot, concealing his hypocrisy under</p>
<p>an air of friendly good-humor.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Moreau may die,&quot; she said. &quot;And besides, he has quarrelled</p>
<p>irrevocably with the Comte de Serizy, his patron.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The deuce he has! Listen, madame; I see you are about to--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, monsieur,&quot; said Oscar&#x27;s mother, interrupting the old man, who,</p>
<p>out of courtesy to the &quot;fair lady,&quot; repressed his annoyance at being</p>
<p>interrupted. &quot;Alas, you do not know the miseries of a mother who, for</p>
<p>seven years past, has been forced to take a sum of six hundred francs</p>
<p>a year for her son&#x27;s education from the miserable eighteen hundred</p>
<p>francs of her husband&#x27;s salary. Yes, monsieur, that is all we have had</p>
<p>to live upon. Therefore, what more can I do for my poor Oscar?</p>
<p>Monsieur Clapart so hates the child that it is impossible for me to</p>
<p>keep him in the house. A poor woman, alone in the world, am I not</p>
<p>right to come and consult the only relation my Oscar has under</p>
<p>heaven?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you are right,&quot; said uncle Cardot. &quot;You never told me of all</p>
<p>this before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, monsieur!&quot; replied Madame Clapart, proudly, &quot;you were the last to</p>
<p>whom I would have told my wretchedness. It is all my own fault; I</p>
<p>married a man whose incapacity is almost beyond belief. Yes, I am,</p>
<p>indeed, most unhappy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to me, madame,&quot; said the little old man, &quot;and don&#x27;t weep; it</p>
<p>is most painful to me to see a fair lady cry. After all, your son</p>
<p>bears the name of Husson, and if my dear deceased wife were living she</p>
<p>would wish to do something for the name of her father and of her</p>
<p>brother--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She loved her brother,&quot; said Oscar&#x27;s mother.</p>
<p>&quot;But all my fortune is given to my children, who expect nothing from</p>
<p>me at my death,&quot; continued the old man. &quot;I have divided among them the</p>
<p>millions that I had, because I wanted to see them happy and enjoying</p>
<p>their wealth during my lifetime. I have nothing now except an annuity;</p>
<p>and at my age one clings to old habits. Do you know the path on which</p>
<p>you ought to start this young fellow?&quot; he went on, after calling to</p>
<p>Oscar and taking him by the arm. &quot;Let him study law; I&#x27;ll pay the</p>
<p>costs. Put him in a lawyer&#x27;s office and let him learn the business of</p>
<p>pettifogging; if he does well, if he distinguishes himself, if he</p>
<p>likes his profession and I am still alive, each of my children shall,</p>
<p>when the proper time comes, lend him a quarter of the cost of a</p>
<p>practice; and I will be security for him. You will only have to feed</p>
<p>and clothe him. Of course he&#x27;ll sow a few wild oats, but he&#x27;ll learn</p>
<p>life. Look at me: I left Lyon with two double louis which my</p>
<p>grandmother gave me, and walked to Paris; and what am I now? Fasting</p>
<p>is good for the health. Discretion, honesty, and work, young man, and</p>
<p>you&#x27;ll succeed. There&#x27;s a great deal of pleasure in earning one&#x27;s</p>
<p>fortune; and if a man keeps his teeth he eats what he likes in his old</p>
<p>age, and sings, as I do, &#x27;La Mere Godichon.&#x27; Remember my words:</p>
<p>Honesty, work, discretion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you hear that, Oscar?&quot; said his mother. &quot;Your uncle sums up in</p>
<p>three words all that I have been saying to you. You ought to carve the</p>
<p>last word in letters of fire on your memory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I have,&quot; said Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Very good,--then thank your uncle; didn&#x27;t you hear him say he would</p>
<p>take charge of your future? You will be a lawyer in Paris.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He doesn&#x27;t see the grandeur of his destiny,&quot; said the little old man,</p>
<p>observing Oscar&#x27;s apathetic air. &quot;Well, he&#x27;s just out of school.</p>
<p>Listen, I&#x27;m no talker,&quot; he continued; &quot;but I have this to say:</p>
<p>Remember that at your age honesty and uprightness are maintained only</p>
<p>by resisting temptations; of which, in a great city like Paris, there</p>
<p>are many at every step. Live in your mother&#x27;s home, in the garret; go</p>
<p>straight to the law-school; from there to your lawyer&#x27;s office; drudge</p>
<p>night and day, and study at home. Become, by the time you are twenty-</p>
<p>two, a second clerk; by the time you are twenty-four, head-clerk; be</p>
<p>steady, and you will win all. If, moreover, you shouldn&#x27;t like the</p>
<p>profession, you might enter the office of my son the notary, and</p>
<p>eventually succeed him. Therefore, work, patience, discretion,</p>
<p>honesty,--those are your landmarks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God grant that you may live thirty years longer to see your fifth</p>
<p>child realizing all we expect from him,&quot; cried Madame Clapart, seizing</p>
<p>uncle Cardot&#x27;s hand and pressing it with a gesture that recalled her</p>
<p>youth.</p>
<p>&quot;Now come to breakfast,&quot; replied the kind old man, leading Oscar by</p>
<p>the ear.</p>
<p>During the meal uncle Cardot observed his nephew without appearing to</p>
<p>do so, and soon saw that the lad knew nothing of life.</p>
<p>&quot;Send him here to me now and then,&quot; he said to Madame Clapart, as he</p>
<p>bade her good-bye, &quot;and I&#x27;ll form him for you.&quot;</p>
<p>This visit calmed the anxieties of the poor mother, who had not hoped</p>
<p>for such brilliant success. For the next fortnight she took Oscar to</p>
<p>walk daily, and watched him tyrannically. This brought matters to the</p>
<p>end of October. One morning as the poor household was breakfasting on</p>
<p>a salad of herring and lettuce, with milk for a dessert, Oscar beheld</p>
<p>with terror the formidable ex-steward, who entered the room and</p>
<p>surprised this scene of poverty.</p>
<p>&quot;We are now living in Paris--but not as we lived at Presles,&quot; said</p>
<p>Moreau, wishing to make known to Madame Clapart the change in their</p>
<p>relations caused by Oscar&#x27;s folly. &quot;I shall seldom be here myself; for</p>
<p>I have gone into partnership with Pere Leger and Pere Margueron of</p>
<p>Beaumont. We are speculating in land, and we have begun by purchasing</p>
<p>the estate of Persan. I am the head of the concern, which has a</p>
<p>capital of a million; part of which I have borrowed on my own</p>
<p>securities. When I find a good thing, Pere Leger and I examine it; my</p>
<p>partners have each a quarter and I a half in the profits; but I do</p>
<p>nearly all the work, and for that reason I shall be constantly on the</p>
<p>road. My wife lives here, in the faubourg du Roule, very plainly. When</p>
<p>we see how the business turns out, if we risk only the profits, and if</p>
<p>Oscar behaves himself, we may, perhaps, employ him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! my friend, the catastrophe caused by my poor boy&#x27;s heedlessness</p>
<p>may prove to be the cause of your making a brilliant fortune; for,</p>
<p>really and truly, you were burying your energy and your capacity at</p>
<p>Presles.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Clapart then went on to relate her visit to uncle Cardot, in</p>
<p>order to show Moreau that neither she nor her son need any longer be a</p>
<p>burden on him.</p>
<p>&quot;He is right, that old fellow,&quot; said the ex-steward. &quot;We must hold</p>
<p>Oscar in that path with an iron hand, and he will end as a barrister</p>
<p>or a notary. But he mustn&#x27;t leave the track; he must go straight</p>
<p>through with it. Ha! I know how to help you. The legal business of</p>
<p>land-agents is quite important, and I have heard of a lawyer who has</p>
<p>just bought what is called a &quot;titre nu&quot;; that means a practice without</p>
<p>clients. He is a young man, hard as an iron bar, eager for work,</p>
<p>ferociously active. His name is Desroches. I&#x27;ll offer him our business</p>
<p>on condition that he takes Oscar as a pupil; and I&#x27;ll ask him to let</p>
<p>the boy live with him at nine hundred francs a year, of which I will</p>
<p>pay three, so that your son will cost you only six hundred francs,</p>
<p>without his living, in future. If the boy ever means to become a man</p>
<p>it can only be under a discipline like that. He&#x27;ll come out of that</p>
<p>office, notary, solicitor, or barrister, as he may elect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come, Oscar; thank our kind Monsieur Moreau, and don&#x27;t stand there</p>
<p>like a stone post. All young men who commit follies have not the good</p>
<p>fortune to meet with friends who still take an interest in their</p>
<p>career, even after they have been injured by them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The best way to make your peace with me,&quot; said Moreau, pressing</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s hand, &quot;is to work now with steady application, and to conduct</p>
<p>yourself in future properly.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>TRICKS AND FARCES OF THE EMBRYO LONG ROBE</p>
<p>Ten days later, Oscar was taken by Monsieur Moreau to Maitre</p>
<p>Desroches, solicitor, recently established in the rue de Bethisy, in a</p>
<p>vast apartment at the end of a narrow court-yard, for which he was</p>
<p>paying a relatively low price.</p>
<p>Desroches, a young man twenty-six years of age, born of poor parents,</p>
<p>and brought up with extreme severity by a stern father, had himself</p>
<p>known the condition in which Oscar now was. Accordingly, he felt an</p>
<p>interest in him, but the sort of interest which alone he could take,</p>
<p>checked by the apparent harshness that characterized him. The aspect</p>
<p>of this gaunt young man, with a muddy skin and hair cropped like a</p>
<p>clothes-brush, who was curt of speech and possessed a piercing eye and</p>
<p>a gloomy vivaciousness, terrified the unhappy Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;We work here day and night,&quot; said the lawyer, from the depths of his</p>
<p>armchair, and behind a table on which were papers, piled up like Alps.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Moreau, we won&#x27;t kill him; but he&#x27;ll have to go at our pace.</p>
<p>Monsieur Godeschal!&quot; he called out.</p>
<p>Though the day was Sunday, the head-clerk appeared, pen in hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Godeschal, here&#x27;s the pupil of whom I spoke to you. Monsieur</p>
<p>Moreau takes the liveliest interest in him. He will dine with us and</p>
<p>sleep in the small attic next to your chamber. You will allot the</p>
<p>exact time it takes to go to the law-school and back, so that he does</p>
<p>not lose five minutes on the way. You will see that he learns the Code</p>
<p>and is proficient in his classes; that is to say, after he has done</p>
<p>his work here, you will give him authors to read. In short, he is to</p>
<p>be under your immediate direction, and I shall keep an eye on it. They</p>
<p>want to make him what you have made yourself, a capable head-clerk,</p>
<p>against the time when he can take such a place himself. Go with</p>
<p>Monsieur Godeschal, my young friend; he&#x27;ll show you your lodging, and</p>
<p>you can settle down in it. Did you notice Godeschal?&quot; continued</p>
<p>Desroches, speaking to Moreau. &quot;There&#x27;s a fellow who, like me, has</p>
<p>nothing. His sister Mariette, the famous danseuse, is laying up her</p>
<p>money to buy him a practice in ten years. My clerks are young blades</p>
<p>who have nothing but their ten fingers to rely upon. So we all, my</p>
<p>five clerks and I, work as hard as a dozen ordinary fellows. But in</p>
<p>ten years I&#x27;ll have the finest practice in Paris. In my office,</p>
<p>business and clients are a passion, and that&#x27;s beginning to make</p>
<p>itself felt. I took Godeschal from Derville, where he was only just</p>
<p>made second clerk. He gets a thousand francs a year from me, and food</p>
<p>and lodging. But he&#x27;s worth it; he is indefatigable. I love him, that</p>
<p>fellow! He has managed to live, as I did when a clerk, on six hundred</p>
<p>francs a year. What I care for above all is honesty, spotless</p>
<p>integrity; and when it is practised in such poverty as that, a man&#x27;s a</p>
<p>man. For the slightest fault of that kind a clerk leaves my office.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The lad is in a good school,&quot; thought Moreau.</p>
<p>For two whole years Oscar lived in the rue de Bethisy, a den of</p>
<p>pettifogging; for if ever that superannuated expression was applicable</p>
<p>to a lawyer&#x27;s office, it was so in this case. Under this supervision,</p>
<p>both petty and able, he was kept to his regular hours and to his work</p>
<p>with such rigidity that his life in the midst of Paris was that of a</p>
<p>monk.</p>
<p>At five in the morning, in all weathers, Godeschal woke up. He went</p>
<p>down with Oscar to the office, where they always found their master up</p>
<p>and working. Oscar then did the errands of the office and prepared his</p>
<p>lessons for the law-school,--and prepared them elaborately; for</p>
<p>Godeschal, and frequently Desroches himself, pointed out to their</p>
<p>pupil authors to be looked through and difficulties to overcome. He</p>
<p>was not allowed to leave a single section of the Code until he had</p>
<p>thoroughly mastered it to the satisfaction of his chief and Godeschal,</p>
<p>who put him through preliminary examinations more searching and longer</p>
<p>than those of the law-school. On his return from his classes, where he</p>
<p>was kept but a short time, he went to his work in the office;</p>
<p>occasionally he was sent to the Palais, but always under the thumb of</p>
<p>the rigid Godeschal, till dinner. The dinner was that of his master,--</p>
<p>one dish of meat, one of vegetables, and a salad. The dessert</p>
<p>consisted of a piece of Gruyere cheese. After dinner, Godeschal and</p>
<p>Oscar returned to the office and worked till night. Once a month Oscar</p>
<p>went to breakfast with his uncle Cardot, and he spent the Sundays with</p>
<p>his mother. From time to time Moreau, when he came to the office about</p>
<p>his own affairs, would take Oscar to dine in the Palais-Royal, and to</p>
<p>some theatre in the evening. Oscar had been so snubbed by Godeschal</p>
<p>and by Desroches for his attempts at elegance that he no longer gave a</p>
<p>thought to his clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;A good clerk,&quot; Godeschal told him, &quot;should have two black coats, one</p>
<p>new, one old, a pair of black trousers, black stockings, and shoes.</p>
<p>Boots cost too much. You can&#x27;t have boots till you are called to the</p>
<p>bar. A clerk should never spend more than seven hundred francs a year.</p>
<p>Good stout shirts of strong linen are what you want. Ha! when a man</p>
<p>starts from nothing to reach fortune, he has to keep down to bare</p>
<p>necessities. Look at Monsieur Desroches; he did what we are doing, and</p>
<p>see where he is now.&quot;</p>
<p>Godeschal preached by example. If he professed the strictest</p>
<p>principles of honor, discretion, and honesty, he practised them</p>
<p>without assumption, as he walked, as he breathed; such action was the</p>
<p>natural play of his soul, as walking and breathing were the natural</p>
<p>play of his organs. Eighteen months after Oscar&#x27;s installation into</p>
<p>the office, the second clerk was, for the second time, slightly wrong</p>
<p>in his accounts, which were comparatively unimportant. Godeschal said</p>
<p>to him in presence of all the other clerks:</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Gaudet, go away from here of your own free will, that it may</p>
<p>not be said that Monsieur Desroches has dismissed you. You have been</p>
<p>careless or absent-minded, and neither of those defects can pass here.</p>
<p>The master shall know nothing about the matter; that is all that I can</p>
<p>do for a comrade.&quot;</p>
<p>At twenty years of age, Oscar became third clerk in the office. Though</p>
<p>he earned no salary, he was lodged and fed, for he did the work of the</p>
<p>second clerk. Desroches employed two chief clerks, and the work of the</p>
<p>second was unremitting toil. By the end of his second year in the law-</p>
<p>school Oscar knew more than most licensed graduates; he did the work</p>
<p>at the Palais intelligently, and argued some cases in chambers.</p>
<p>Godeschal and Desroches were satisfied with him. And yet, though he</p>
<p>now seemed a sensible man, he showed, from time to time, a hankering</p>
<p>after pleasure and a desire to shine, repressed, though it was, by the</p>
<p>stern discipline and continual toil of his life.</p>
<p>Moreau, satisfied with Oscar&#x27;s progress, relaxed, in some degree, his</p>
<p>watchfulness; and when, in July, 1825, Oscar passed his examinations</p>
<p>with a spotless record, the land-agent gave him the money to dress</p>
<p>himself elegantly. Madame Clapart, proud and happy in her son,</p>
<p>prepared the outfit splendidly for the rising lawyer.</p>
<p>In the month of November, when the courts reopened, Oscar Husson</p>
<p>occupied the chamber of the second clerk, whose work he now did</p>
<p>wholly. He had a salary of eight hundred francs with board and</p>
<p>lodging. Consequently, uncle Cardot, who went privately to Desroches</p>
<p>and made inquiries about his nephew, promised Madame Clapart to be on</p>
<p>the lookout for a practice for Oscar, if he continued to do as well in</p>
<p>the future.</p>
<p>In spite of these virtuous appearances, Oscar Husson was undergoing a</p>
<p>great strife in his inmost being. At times he thought of quitting a</p>
<p>life so directly against his tastes and his nature. He felt that</p>
<p>galley-slaves were happier than he. Galled by the collar of this iron</p>
<p>system, wild desires seized him to fly when he compared himself in the</p>
<p>street with the well-dressed young men whom he met. Sometimes he was</p>
<p>driven by a sort of madness towards women; then, again, he resigned</p>
<p>himself, but only to fall into a deeper disgust for life. Impelled by</p>
<p>the example of Godeschal, he was forced, rather than led of himself,</p>
<p>to remain in that rugged way.</p>
<p>Godeschal, who watched and took note of Oscar, made it a matter of</p>
<p>principle not to allow his pupil to be exposed to temptation.</p>
<p>Generally the young clerk was without money, or had so little that he</p>
<p>could not, if he would, give way to excess. During the last year, the</p>
<p>worthy Godeschal had made five or six parties of pleasure with Oscar,</p>
<p>defraying the expenses, for he felt that the rope by which he tethered</p>
<p>the young kid must be slackened. These &quot;pranks,&quot; as he called them,</p>
<p>helped Oscar to endure existence, for there was little amusement in</p>
<p>breakfasting with his uncle Cardot, and still less in going to see his</p>
<p>mother, who lived even more penuriously than Desroches. Moreau could</p>
<p>not make himself familiar with Oscar as Godeschal could; and perhaps</p>
<p>that sincere friend to young Husson was behind Godeschal in these</p>
<p>efforts to initiate the poor youth safely into the mysteries of life.</p>
<p>Oscar, grown prudent, had come, through contact with others, to see</p>
<p>the extent and the character of the fault he had committed on that</p>
<p>luckless journey; but the volume of his repressed fancies and the</p>
<p>follies of youth might still get the better of him. Nevertheless, the</p>
<p>more knowledge he could get of the world and its laws, the better his</p>
<p>mind would form itself, and, provided Godeschal never lost sight of</p>
<p>him, Moreau flattered himself that between them they could bring the</p>
<p>son of Madame Clapart through in safety.</p>
<p>&quot;How is he getting on?&quot; asked the land-agent of Godeschal on his</p>
<p>return from one of his journeys which had kept him some months out of</p>
<p>Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;Always too much vanity,&quot; replied Godeschal. &quot;You give him fine</p>
<p>clothes and fine linen, he wears the shirt-fronts of a stockbroker,</p>
<p>and so my dainty coxcomb spends his Sundays in the Tuileries, looking</p>
<p>out for adventures. What else can you expect? That&#x27;s youth. He</p>
<p>torments me to present him to my sister, where he would see a pretty</p>
<p>sort of society!--actresses, ballet-dancers, elegant young fops,</p>
<p>spendthrifts who are wasting their fortunes! His mind, I&#x27;m afraid, is</p>
<p>not fitted for law. He can talk well, though; and if we could make him</p>
<p>a barrister he might plead cases that were carefully prepared for</p>
<p>him.&quot;</p>
<p>In the month of November, 1825, soon after Oscar Husson had taken</p>
<p>possession of his new clerkship, and at the moment when he was about</p>
<p>to pass his examination for the licentiate&#x27;s degree, a new clerk</p>
<p>arrived to take the place made vacant by Oscar&#x27;s promotion.</p>
<p>This fourth clerk, named Frederic Marest, intended to enter the</p>
<p>magistracy, and was now in his third year at the law school. He was a</p>
<p>fine young man of twenty-three, enriched to the amount of some twelve</p>
<p>thousand francs a year by the death of a bachelor uncle, and the son</p>
<p>of Madame Marest, widow of the wealthy wood-merchant. This future</p>
<p>magistrate, actuated by a laudable desire to understand his vocation</p>
<p>in its smallest details, had put himself in Desroches&#x27; office for the</p>
<p>purpose of studying legal procedure, and of training himself to take a</p>
<p>place as head-clerk in two years. He hoped to do his &quot;stage&quot; (the</p>
<p>period between the admission as licentiate and the call to the bar) in</p>
<p>Paris, in order to be fully prepared for the functions of a post which</p>
<p>would surely not be refused to a rich young man. To see himself, by</p>
<p>the time he was thirty, &quot;procureur du roi&quot; in any court, no matter</p>
<p>where, was his sole ambition. Though Frederic Marest was cousin-german</p>
<p>to Georges Marest, the latter not having told his surname in</p>
<p>Pierrotin&#x27;s coucou, Oscar Husson did not connect the present Marest</p>
<p>with the grandson of Czerni-Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Messieurs,&quot; said Godeschal at breakfast time, addressing all the</p>
<p>clerks, &quot;I announce to you the arrival of a new jurisconsult; and as</p>
<p>he is rich, rishissime, we will make him, I hope, pay a glorious</p>
<p>entrance-fee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forward, the book!&quot; cried Oscar, nodding to the youngest clerk, &quot;and</p>
<p>pray let us be serious.&quot;</p>
<p>The youngest clerk climbed like a squirrel along the shelves which</p>
<p>lined the room, until he could reach a register placed on the top</p>
<p>shelf, where a thick layer of dust had settled on it.</p>
<p>&quot;It is getting colored,&quot; said the little clerk, exhibiting the volume.</p>
<p>We must explain the perennial joke of this book, then much in vogue in</p>
<p>legal offices. In a clerical life where work is the rule, amusement is</p>
<p>all the more treasured because it is rare; but, above all, a hoax or a</p>
<p>practical joke is enjoyed with delight. This fancy or custom does, to</p>
<p>a certain extent, explain Georges Marest&#x27;s behavior in the coucou. The</p>
<p>gravest and most gloomy clerk is possessed, at times, with a craving</p>
<p>for fun and quizzing. The instinct with which a set of young clerks</p>
<p>will seize and develop a hoax or a practical joke is really</p>
<p>marvellous. The denizens of a studio and of a lawyer&#x27;s office are, in</p>
<p>this line, superior to comedians.</p>
<p>In buying a practice without clients, Desroches began, as it were, a</p>
<p>new dynasty. This circumstance made a break in the usages relative to</p>
<p>the reception of new-comers. Moreover, Desroches having taken an</p>
<p>office where legal documents had never yet been scribbled, had bought</p>
<p>new tables, and white boxes edged with blue, also new. His staff was</p>
<p>made up of clerks coming from other officers, without mutual ties, and</p>
<p>surprised, as one may say, to find themselves together. Godeschal, who</p>
<p>had served his apprenticeship under Maitre Derville, was not the sort</p>
<p>of clerk to allow the precious tradition of the &quot;welcome&quot; to be lost.</p>
<p>This &quot;welcome&quot; is a breakfast which every neophyte must give to the</p>
<p>&quot;ancients&quot; of the office into which he enters.</p>
<p>Now, about the time when Oscar came to the office, during the first</p>
<p>six months of Desroches&#x27; installation, on a winter evening when the</p>
<p>work had been got through more quickly than usual, and the clerks were</p>
<p>warming themselves before the fire preparatory to departure, it came</p>
<p>into Godeschal&#x27;s head to construct and compose a Register</p>
<p>&quot;architriclino-basochien,&quot; of the utmost antiquity, saved from the</p>
<p>fires of the Revolution, and derived through the procureur of the</p>
<p>Chatelet-Bordin, the immediate predecessor of Sauvaguest, the</p>
<p>attorney, from whom Desroches had bought his practice. The work, which</p>
<p>was highly approved by the other clerks, was begun by a search through</p>
<p>all the dealers in old paper for a register, made of paper with the</p>
<p>mark of the eighteenth century, duly bound in parchment, on which</p>
<p>should be the stamp of an order in council. Having found such a volume</p>
<p>it was left about in the dust, on the stove, on the ground, in the</p>
<p>kitchen, and even in what the clerks called the &quot;chamber of</p>
<p>deliberations&quot;; and thus it obtained a mouldiness to delight an</p>
<p>antiquary, cracks of aged dilapidation, and broken corners that looked</p>
<p>as though the rats had gnawed them; also, the gilt edges were</p>
<p>tarnished with surprising perfection. As soon as the book was duly</p>
<p>prepared, the entries were made. The following extracts will show to</p>
<p>the most obtuse mind the purpose to which the office of Maitre</p>
<p>Desroches devoted this register, the first sixty pages of which were</p>
<p>filled with reports of fictitious cases. On the first page appeared as</p>
<p>follows, in the legal spelling of the eighteenth century:--</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, so be it. This</p>
<p>day, the feast of our lady Saincte-Geneviesve, patron saint of</p>
<p>Paris, under whose protection have existed, since the year 1525</p>
<p>the clerks of this Practice, we the under-signed, clerks and sub-</p>
<p>clerks of Maistre Jerosme-Sebastien Bordin, successor to the late</p>
<p>Guerbet, in his lifetime procureur at the Chastelet, do hereby</p>
<p>recognize the obligation under which we lie to renew and continue</p>
<p>the register and the archives of installation of the clerks of</p>
<p>this noble Practice, a glorious member of the Kingdom of Basoche,</p>
<p>the which register, being now full in consequence of the many acts</p>
<p>and deeds of our well-beloved predecessors, we have consigned to</p>
<p>the Keeper of the Archives of the Palais for safe-keeping, with</p>
<p>the registers of other ancient Practices; and we have ourselves</p>
<p>gone, each and all, to hear mass at the parish church of Saint-</p>
<p>Severin to solemnize the inauguration of this our new register.</p>
<p>In witness whereof we have hereunto signed our names: Malin, head-</p>
<p>clerk; Grevin, second-clerk; Athanase Feret, clerk; Jacques Heret,</p>
<p>clerk; Regnault de Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Angely, clerk; Bedeau, youngest</p>
<p>clerk and gutter-jumper.</p>
<p>In the year of our Lord 1787.</p>
<p>After the mass aforesaid was heard, we conveyed ourselves to</p>
<p>Courtille, where, at the common charge, we ordered a fine</p>
<p>breakfast; which did not end till seven o&#x27;clock the next morning.</p>
<p>This was marvellously well engrossed. An expert would have said that</p>
<p>it was written in the eighteenth century. Twenty-seven reports of</p>
<p>receptions of neophytes followed, the last in the fatal year of 1792.</p>
<p>Then came a blank of fourteen years; after which the register began</p>
<p>again, in 1806, with the appointment of Bordin as attorney before the</p>
<p>first Court of the Seine. And here follows the deed which proclaimed</p>
<p>the reconstitution of the kingdom of Basoche:--</p>
<p>God in his mercy willed that, in spite of the fearful storms which</p>
<p>have cruelly ravaged the land of France, now become a great</p>
<p>Empire, the archives of the very celebrated Practice of Maitre</p>
<p>Bordin should be preserved; and we, the undersigned, clerks of the</p>
<p>very virtuous and very worthy Maitre Bordin, do not hesitate to</p>
<p>attribute this unheard-of preservation, when all titles,</p>
<p>privileges, and charters were lost, to the protection of Sainte-</p>
<p>Genevieve, patron Saint of this office, and also to the reverence</p>
<p>which the last of the procureurs of noble race had for all that</p>
<p>belonged to ancient usages and customs. In the uncertainty of</p>
<p>knowing the exact part of Sainte-Genevieve and Maitre Bordin in</p>
<p>this miracle, we have resolved, each of us, to go to Saint-Etienne</p>
<p>du Mont and there hear mass, which will be said before the altar</p>
<p>of that Holy-Shepherdess who sends us sheep to shear, and also to</p>
<p>offer a breakfast to our master Bordin, hoping that he will pay</p>
<p>the costs.</p>
<p>Signed: Oignard, first clerk; Poidevin, second clerk; Proust,</p>
<p>clerk; Augustin Coret, sub-clerk.</p>
<p>At the office.</p>
<p>November, 1806.</p>
<p>At three in the afternoon, the above-named clerks hereby return</p>
<p>their grateful thanks to their excellent master, who regaled them</p>
<p>at the establishment of the Sieur Rolland restaurateur, rue du</p>
<p>Hasard, with exquisite wines of three regions, to wit: Bordeaux,</p>
<p>Champagne, and Burgundy, also with dishes most carefully chosen,</p>
<p>between the hours of four in the afternoon to half-past seven in</p>
<p>the evening. Coffee, ices, and liqueurs were in abundance. But</p>
<p>the presence of the master himself forbade the chanting of hymns</p>
<p>of praise in clerical stanzas. No clerk exceeded the bounds of</p>
<p>amiable gayety, for the worthy, respectable, and generous patron</p>
<p>had promised to take his clerks to see Talma in &quot;Brittanicus,&quot; at</p>
<p>the Theatre-Francais. Long life to Maitre Bordin! May God shed</p>
<p>favors on his venerable pow! May he sell dear so glorious a</p>
<p>practice! May the rich clients for whom he prays arrive! May his</p>
<p>bills of costs and charges be paid in a trice! May our masters to</p>
<p>come be like him! May he ever be loved by clerks in other worlds</p>
<p>than this!</p>
<p>Here followed thirty-three reports of various receptions of new</p>
<p>clerks, distinguished from one another by different writing and</p>
<p>different inks, also by quotations, signatures, and praises of good</p>
<p>cheer and wines, which seemed to show that each report was written and</p>
<p>signed on the spot, &quot;inter pocula.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, under date of the month of June, 1822, the period when</p>
<p>Desroches took the oath, appears this constitutional declaration:--</p>
<p>I, the undersigned, Francois-Claude-Marie Godeschal, called by</p>
<p>Maitre Desroches to perform the difficult functions of head-clerk</p>
<p>in a Practice where the clients have to be created, having learned</p>
<p>through Maitre Derville, from whose office I come, of the</p>
<p>existence of the famous archives architriclino-basochien, so</p>
<p>celebrated at the Palais, have implored our gracious master to</p>
<p>obtain them from his predecessor; for it has become of the highest</p>
<p>importance to recover a document bearing date of the year 1786,</p>
<p>which is connected with other documents deposited for safe-keeping</p>
<p>at the Palais, the existence of which has been certified to by</p>
<p>Messrs. Terrasse and Duclos, keepers of records, by the help of</p>
<p>which we may go back to the year 1525, and find historical</p>
<p>indications of the utmost value on the manners, customs, and</p>
<p>cookery of the clerical race.</p>
<p>Having received a favorable answer to this request, the present</p>
<p>office has this day been put in possession of these proofs of the</p>
<p>worship in which our predecessors held the Goddess Bottle and good</p>
<p>living.</p>
<p>In consequence thereof, for the edification of our successors, and</p>
<p>to renew the chain of years and goblets, I, the said Godeschal,</p>
<p>have invited Messieurs Doublet, second clerk; Vassal, third clerk;</p>
<p>Herisson and Grandemain, clerks; and Dumets, sub-clerk, to</p>
<p>breakfast, Sunday next, at the &quot;Cheval Rouge,&quot; on the Quai Saint-</p>
<p>Bernard, where we will celebrate the victory of obtaining this</p>
<p>volume which contains the Charter of our gullets.</p>
<p>This day, Sunday, June 27th, were imbibed twelve bottles of twelve</p>
<p>different wines, regarded as exquisite; also were devoured melons,</p>
<p>&quot;pates au jus romanum,&quot; and a fillet of beef with mushroom sauce.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Mariette, the illustrious sister of our head-clerk</p>
<p>and leading lady of the Royal Academy of music and dancing, having</p>
<p>obligingly put at the disposition of this Practice orchestra seats</p>
<p>for the performance of this evening, it is proper to make this</p>
<p>record of her generosity. Moreover, it is hereby decreed that the</p>
<p>aforesaid clerks shall convey themselves in a body to that noble</p>
<p>demoiselle to thank her in person, and declare to her that on the</p>
<p>occasion of her first lawsuit, if the devil sends her one, she</p>
<p>shall pay the money laid out upon it, and no more.</p>
<p>And our head-clerk Godeschal has been and is hereby proclaimed a</p>
<p>flower of Basoche, and, more especially, a good fellow. May a man</p>
<p>who treats so well be soon in treaty for a Practice of his own!</p>
<p>On this record were stains of wine, pates, and candle-grease. To</p>
<p>exhibit the stamp of truth that the writers had managed to put upon</p>
<p>these records, we may here give the report of Oscar&#x27;s own pretended</p>
<p>reception:--</p>
<p>This day, Monday, November 25th, 1822, after a session held</p>
<p>yesterday at the rue de la Cerisaie, Arsenal quarter, at the house</p>
<p>of Madame Clapart, mother of the candidate-basochien Oscar Husson,</p>
<p>we, the undersigned, declare that the repast of admission</p>
<p>surpassed our expectations. It was composed of radishes, pink and</p>
<p>black, gherkins, anchovies, butter and olives for hors-d&#x27;oeuvre; a</p>
<p>succulent soup of rice, bearing testimony to maternal solicitude,</p>
<p>for we recognized therein a delicious taste of poultry; indeed, by</p>
<p>acknowledgment of the new member, we learned that the gibbets of a</p>
<p>fine stew prepared by the hands of Madame Clapart herself had been</p>
<p>judiciously inserted into the family soup-pot with a care that is</p>
<p>never taken except in such households.</p>
<p>Item: the said gibbets inclosed in a sea of jelly.</p>
<p>Item: a tongue of beef with tomatoes, which rendered us all</p>
<p>tongue-tied automatoes.</p>
<p>Item: a compote of pigeons with caused us to think the angels had</p>
<p>had a finger in it.</p>
<p>Item: a timbale of macaroni surrounded by chocolate custards.</p>
<p>Item: a dessert composed of eleven delicate dishes, among which we</p>
<p>remarked (in spite of the tipsiness caused by sixteen bottles of</p>
<p>the choicest wines) a compote of peaches of august and mirobolant</p>
<p>delicacy.</p>
<p>The wines of Roussillon and those of the banks of the Rhone</p>
<p>completely effaced those of Champagne and Burgundy. A bottle of</p>
<p>maraschino and another of kirsch did, in spite of the exquisite</p>
<p>coffee, plunge us into so marked an oenological ecstasy that we</p>
<p>found ourselves at a late hour in the Bois de Boulogne instead of</p>
<p>our domicile, where we thought we were.</p>
<p>In the statutes of our Order there is one rule which is rigidly</p>
<p>enforced; namely, to allow all candidates for the privilege of</p>
<p>Basoche to limit the magnificence of their feast of welcome to the</p>
<p>length of their purse; for it is publicly notorious that no one</p>
<p>delivers himself up to Themis if he has a fortune, and every clerk</p>
<p>is, alas, sternly curtailed by his parents. Consequently, we</p>
<p>hereby record with the highest praise the liberal conduct of</p>
<p>Madame Clapart, widow, by her first marriage, of Monsieur Husson,</p>
<p>father of the candidate, who is worthy of the hurrahs which we</p>
<p>gave for her at dessert.</p>
<p>To all of which we hereby set our hands.</p>
<p>[Signed by all the clerks.]</p>
<p>Three clerks had already been deceived by the Book, and three real</p>
<p>&quot;receptions of welcome,&quot; were recorded on this imposing register.</p>
<p>The day after the arrival of each neophyte, the little sub-clerk (the</p>
<p>errand-boy and &quot;gutter-jumper&quot;) laid upon the new-comer&#x27;s desk the</p>
<p>&quot;Archives Architriclino-Basochiennes,&quot; and the clerks enjoyed the</p>
<p>sight of his countenance as he studied its facetious pages. Inter</p>
<p>pocula each candidate had learned the secret of the farce, and the</p>
<p>revelation inspired him with the desire to hoax his successor.</p>
<p>We see now why Oscar, become in his turn participator in the hoax,</p>
<p>called out to the little clerk, &quot;Forward, the book!&quot;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later a handsome young man, with a fine figure and</p>
<p>pleasant face, presented himself, asked for Monsieur Desroches, and</p>
<p>gave his name without hesitation to Godeschal.</p>
<p>&quot;I am Frederic Marest,&quot; he said, &quot;and I come to take the place of</p>
<p>third clerk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Husson,&quot; said Godeschal to Oscar, &quot;show monsieur his seat</p>
<p>and tell him about the customs of the office.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day the new clerk found the register lying on his desk. He</p>
<p>took it up, but after reading a few pages he began to laugh, said</p>
<p>nothing to the assembled clerks, and laid the book down again.</p>
<p>&quot;Messieurs,&quot; he said, when the hour of departure came at five o&#x27;clock,</p>
<p>&quot;I have a cousin who is head clerk of the notary Maitre Leopold</p>
<p>Hannequin; I will ask his advice as to what I ought to do for my</p>
<p>welcome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That looks ill,&quot; cried Godeschal, when Frederic had gone, &quot;he hasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>the cut of a novice, that fellow!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll get some fun out of him yet,&quot; said Oscar.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>LA MARQUISE DE LAS FLORENTINAS Y CABIROLOS</p>
<p>The following day, at two o&#x27;clock, a young man entered the office,</p>
<p>whom Oscar recognized as Georges Marest, now head-clerk of the notary</p>
<p>Hannequin.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! here&#x27;s the friend of Ali pacha!&quot; he exclaimed in a flippant way.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! you here, Monsieur l&#x27;ambassadeur!&quot; returned Georges,</p>
<p>recollecting Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;So you know each other?&quot; said Godeschal, addressing Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;I should think so! We got into a scrape together,&quot; replied Georges,</p>
<p>&quot;about two years ago. Yes, I had to leave Crottat and go to Hannequin</p>
<p>in consequence of that affair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was it?&quot; asked Godeschal.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, nothing!&quot; replied Georges, at a sign from Oscar. &quot;We tried to</p>
<p>hoax a peer of France, and he bowled us over. Ah ca! so you want to</p>
<p>jockey my cousin, do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We jockey no one,&quot; replied Oscar, with dignity; &quot;there&#x27;s our</p>
<p>charter.&quot;</p>
<p>And he presented the famous register, pointing to a place where</p>
<p>sentence of banishment was passed on a refractory who was stated to</p>
<p>have been forced, for acts of dishonesty, to leave the office in 1788.</p>
<p>Georges laughed as he looked through the archives.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well,&quot; he said, &quot;my cousin and I are rich, and we&#x27;ll give you a</p>
<p>fete such as you never had before,--something to stimulate your</p>
<p>imaginations for that register. To-morrow (Sunday) you are bidden to</p>
<p>the Rocher de Cancale at two o&#x27;clock. Afterwards, I&#x27;ll take you to</p>
<p>spend the evening with Madame la Marquise de las Florentinas y</p>
<p>Cabirolos, where we shall play cards, and you&#x27;ll see the elite of the</p>
<p>women of fashion. Therefore, gentleman of the lower courts,&quot; he added,</p>
<p>with notarial assumption, &quot;you will have to behave yourselves, and</p>
<p>carry your wine like the seigneurs of the Regency.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hurrah!&quot; cried the office like one man. &quot;Bravo! very well! vivat!</p>
<p>Long live the Marests!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s all this about?&quot; asked Desroches, coming out from his private</p>
<p>office. &quot;Ah! is that you, Georges? I know what you are after; you want</p>
<p>to demoralize my clerks.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, he withdrew into his own room, calling Oscar after him.</p>
<p>&quot;Here,&quot; he said, opening his cash-box, &quot;are five hundred francs. Go to</p>
<p>the Palais, and get from the registrar a copy of the decision in</p>
<p>Vandernesse against Vandernesse; it must be served to-night if</p>
<p>possible. I have promised a PROD of twenty francs to Simon. Wait for</p>
<p>the copy if it is not ready. Above all, don&#x27;t let yourself be fooled;</p>
<p>for Derville is capable, in the interest of his clients, to stick a</p>
<p>spoke in our wheel. Count Felix de Vandernesse is more powerful than</p>
<p>his brother, our client, the ambassador. Therefore keep your eyes</p>
<p>open, and if there&#x27;s the slightest hitch come back to me at once.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar departed with the full intention of distinguishing himself in</p>
<p>this little skirmish,--the first affair entrusted to him since his</p>
<p>installation as second clerk.</p>
<p>After the departure of Georges and Oscar, Godeschal sounded the new</p>
<p>clerk to discover the joke which, as he thought, lay behind this</p>
<p>Marquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos. But Frederic, with the</p>
<p>coolness and gravity of a king&#x27;s attorney, continued his cousin&#x27;s</p>
<p>hoax, and by his way of answering, and his manner generally, he</p>
<p>succeeded in making the office believe that the marquise might really</p>
<p>be the widow of a Spanish grandee, to whom his cousin Georges was</p>
<p>paying his addresses. Born in Mexico, and the daughter of Creole</p>
<p>parents, this young and wealthy widow was noted for the easy manners</p>
<p>and habits of the women of those climates.</p>
<p>&quot;She loves to laugh, she loves to sing, she loves to drink like me!&quot;</p>
<p>he said in a low voice, quoting the well-known song of Beranger.</p>
<p>&quot;Georges,&quot; he added, &quot;is very rich; he has inherited from his father</p>
<p>(who was a widower) eighteen thousand francs a year, and with the</p>
<p>twelve thousand which an uncle has just left to each of us, he has an</p>
<p>income of thirty thousand. So he pays his debts, and gives up the law.</p>
<p>He hopes to be Marquis de las Florentinas, for the young widow is</p>
<p>marquise in her own right, and has the privilege of giving her titles</p>
<p>to her husband.&quot;</p>
<p>Though the clerks were still a good deal undecided in mind as to the</p>
<p>marquise, the double perspective of a breakfast at the Rocher de</p>
<p>Cancale and a fashionable festivity put them into a state of joyous</p>
<p>expectation. They reserved all points as to the Spanish lady,</p>
<p>intending to judge her without appeal after the meeting.</p>
<p>The Marquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos was neither more nor less</p>
<p>than Mademoiselle Agathe-Florentine Cabirolle, first danseuse at the</p>
<p>Gaiete, with whom uncle Cardot was in the habit of singing &quot;Mere</p>
<p>Godichon.&quot; A year after the very reparable loss of Madame Cardot, the</p>
<p>successful merchant encountered Florentine as she was leaving Coulon&#x27;s</p>
<p>dancing-class. Attracted by the beauty of that choregraphic flower</p>
<p>(Florentine was then about thirteen years of age), he followed her to</p>
<p>the rue Pastourel, where he found that the future star of the ballet</p>
<p>was the daughter of a portress. Two weeks later, the mother and</p>
<p>daughter, established in the rue de Crussol, were enjoying a modest</p>
<p>competence. It was to this protector of the arts--to use the</p>
<p>consecrated phrase--that the theatre owed the brilliant danseuse. The</p>
<p>generous Maecenas made two beings almost beside themselves with joy in</p>
<p>the possession of mahogany furniture, hangings, carpets, and a regular</p>
<p>kitchen; he allowed them a woman-of-all-work, and gave them two</p>
<p>hundred and fifty francs a month for their living. Pere Cardot, with</p>
<p>his hair in &quot;pigeon-wings,&quot; seemed like an angel, and was treated with</p>
<p>the attention due to a benefactor. To him this was the age of gold.</p>
<p>For three years the warbler of &quot;Mere Godichon&quot; had the wise policy to</p>
<p>keep Mademoiselle Cabirolle and her mother in this little apartment,</p>
<p>which was only ten steps from the theatre; but he gave the girl, out</p>
<p>of love for the choregraphic art, the great Vestris for a master. In</p>
<p>1820 he had the pleasure of seeing Florentine dance her first &quot;pas&quot; in</p>
<p>the ballet of a melodrama entitled &quot;The Ruins of Babylon.&quot; Florentine</p>
<p>was then about sixteen. Shortly after this debut Pere Cardot became an</p>
<p>&quot;old screw&quot; in the eyes of his protegee; but as he had the sense to</p>
<p>see that a danseuse at the Gaiete had a certain rank to maintain, he</p>
<p>raised the monthly stipend to five hundred francs, for which, although</p>
<p>he did not again become an angel, he was, at least, a &quot;friend for</p>
<p>life,&quot; a second father. This was his silver age.</p>
<p>From 1820 to 1823, Florentine had the experience of every danseuse of</p>
<p>nineteen to twenty years of age. Her friends were the illustrious</p>
<p>Mariette and Tullia, leading ladies of the Opera, Florine, and also</p>
<p>poor Coralie, torn too early from the arts, and love, and Camusot. As</p>
<p>old Cardot had by this time acquired five additional years, he had</p>
<p>fallen into the indulgence of a semi-paternity, which is the way with</p>
<p>old men towards the young talents they have trained, and which owe</p>
<p>their success to them. Besides, where could he have found another</p>
<p>Florentine who knew all his habits and likings, and with whom he and</p>
<p>his friends could sing &quot;Mere Godichon&quot;? So the little old man remained</p>
<p>under a yoke that was semi-conjugal and also irresistibly strong. This</p>
<p>was the brass age for the old fellow.</p>
<p>During the five years of silver and gold Pere Cardot had laid by</p>
<p>eighty thousand francs. The old gentleman, wise from experience,</p>
<p>foresaw that by the time he was seventy Florentine would be of age,</p>
<p>probably engaged at the Opera, and, consequently, wanting all the</p>
<p>luxury of a theatrical star. Some days before the party mentioned by</p>
<p>Georges, Pere Cardot had spent the sum of forty-five thousand francs</p>
<p>in fitting up for his Florentine the former apartment of the late</p>
<p>Coralie. In Paris there are suites of rooms as well as houses and</p>
<p>streets that have their predestinations. Enriched with a magnificent</p>
<p>service of plate, the &quot;prima danseuse&quot; of the Gaiete began to give</p>
<p>dinners, spent three hundred francs a month on her dress, never went</p>
<p>out except in a hired carriage, and had a maid for herself, a cook,</p>
<p>and a little footman.</p>
<p>In fact, an engagement at the Opera was already in the wind. The Cocon</p>
<p>d&#x27;Or did homage to its first master by sending its most splendid</p>
<p>products for the gratification of Mademoiselle Cabirolle, now called</p>
<p>Florentine. The magnificence which suddenly burst upon her apartment</p>
<p>in the rue de Vendome would have satisfied the most ambitious</p>
<p>supernumerary. After being the master of the ship for seven years,</p>
<p>Cardot now found himself towed along by a force of unlimited caprice.</p>
<p>But the luckless old gentleman was fond of his tyrant. Florentine was</p>
<p>to close his eyes; he meant to leave her a hundred thousand francs.</p>
<p>The iron age had now begun.</p>
<p>Georges Marest, with thirty thousand francs a year, and a handsome</p>
<p>face, courted Florentine. Every danseuse makes a point of having some</p>
<p>young man who will take her to drive, and arrange the gay excursions</p>
<p>into the country which all such women delight in. However</p>
<p>disinterested she may be, the courtship of such a star is a passion</p>
<p>which costs some trifles to the favored mortal. There are dinners at</p>
<p>restaurants, boxes at the theatres, carriages to go to the environs</p>
<p>and return, choice wines consumed in profusion,--for an opera danseuse</p>
<p>eats and drinks like an athlete. Georges amused himself like other</p>
<p>young men who pass at a jump from paternal discipline to a rich</p>
<p>independence, and the death of his uncle, nearly doubling his means,</p>
<p>had still further enlarged his ideas. As long as he had only his</p>
<p>patrimony of eighteen thousand francs a year, his intention was to</p>
<p>become a notary, but (as his cousin remarked to the clerks of</p>
<p>Desroches) a man must be stupid who begins a profession with the</p>
<p>fortune most men hope to acquire in order to leave it. Wiser then</p>
<p>Georges, Frederic persisted in following the career of public office,</p>
<p>and of putting himself, as we have seen, in training for it.</p>
<p>A young man as handsome and attractive as Georges might very well</p>
<p>aspire to the hand of a rich creole; and the clerks in Desroches&#x27;</p>
<p>office, all of them the sons of poor parents, having never frequented</p>
<p>the great world, or, indeed, known anything about it, put themselves</p>
<p>into their best clothes on the following day, impatient enough to</p>
<p>behold, and be presented to the Mexican Marquise de las Florentinas y</p>
<p>Cabirolos.</p>
<p>&quot;What luck,&quot; said Oscar to Godeschal, as they were getting up in the</p>
<p>morning, &quot;that I had just ordered a new coat and trousers and</p>
<p>waistcoat, and that my dear mother had made me that fine outfit! I</p>
<p>have six frilled shirts of fine linen in the dozen she made for me. We</p>
<p>shall make an appearance! Ha! ha! suppose one of us were to carry off</p>
<p>the Creole marchioness from that Georges Marest!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fine occupation that, for a clerk in our office!&quot; cried Godeschal.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you never control your vanity, popinjay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! monsieur,&quot; said Madame Clapart, who entered the room at that</p>
<p>moment to bring her son some cravats, and overhead the last words of</p>
<p>the head-clerk, &quot;would to God that my Oscar might always follow your</p>
<p>advice. It is what I tell him all the time: &#x27;Imitate Monsieur</p>
<p>Godeschal; listen to what he tells you.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;ll go all right, madame,&quot; interposed Godeschal, &quot;but he mustn&#x27;t</p>
<p>commit any more blunders like one he was guilty of last night, or</p>
<p>he&#x27;ll lose the confidence of the master. Monsieur Desroches won&#x27;t</p>
<p>stand any one not succeeding in what he tells them to do. He ordered</p>
<p>your son, for a first employment in his new clerkship, to get a copy</p>
<p>of a judgment which ought to have been served last evening, and Oscar,</p>
<p>instead of doing so, allowed himself to be fooled. The master was</p>
<p>furious. It&#x27;s a chance if I have been able to repair the mischief by</p>
<p>going this morning, at six o&#x27;clock, to see the head-clerk at the</p>
<p>Palais, who has promised me to have a copy ready by seven o&#x27;clock to-</p>
<p>morrow morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, Godeschal!&quot; cried Oscar, going up to him and pressing his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;You are, indeed, a true friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, monsieur!&quot; said Madame Clapart, &quot;a mother is happy, indeed, in</p>
<p>knowing that her son has a friend like you; you may rely upon a</p>
<p>gratitude which can end only with my life. Oscar, one thing I want to</p>
<p>say to you now. Distrust that Georges Marest. I wish you had never met</p>
<p>him again, for he was the cause of your first great misfortune in</p>
<p>life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was he? How so?&quot; asked Godeschal.</p>
<p>The too devoted mother explained succinctly the adventure of her poor</p>
<p>Oscar in Pierrotin&#x27;s coucou.</p>
<p>&quot;I am certain,&quot; said Godeschal, &quot;that that blagueur is preparing some</p>
<p>trick against us for this evening. As for me, I can&#x27;t go to the</p>
<p>Marquise de las Florentinas&#x27; party, for my sister wants me to draw up</p>
<p>the terms of her new engagement; I shall have to leave after the</p>
<p>dessert. But, Oscar, be on your guard. They will ask you to play, and,</p>
<p>of course, the Desroches office mustn&#x27;t draw back; but be careful. You</p>
<p>shall play for both of us; here&#x27;s a hundred francs,&quot; said the good</p>
<p>fellow, knowing that Oscar&#x27;s purse was dry from the demands of his</p>
<p>tailor and bootmaker. &quot;Be prudent; remember not to play beyond that</p>
<p>sum; and don&#x27;t let yourself get tipsy, either with play or libations.</p>
<p>Saperlotte! a second clerk is already a man of weight, and shouldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>gamble on notes, or go beyond a certain limit in anything. His</p>
<p>business is to get himself admitted to the bar. Therefore don&#x27;t drink</p>
<p>too much, don&#x27;t play too long, and maintain a proper dignity,--that&#x27;s</p>
<p>your rule of conduct. Above all, get home by midnight; for, remember,</p>
<p>you must be at the Palais to-morrow morning by seven to get that</p>
<p>judgment. A man is not forbidden to amuse himself, but business first,</p>
<p>my boy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you hear that, Oscar?&quot; said Madame Clapart. &quot;Monsieur Godeschal is</p>
<p>indulgent; see how well he knows how to combine the pleasures of youth</p>
<p>and the duties of his calling.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Clapart, on the arrival of the tailor and the bootmaker with</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s new clothes, remained alone with Godeschal, in order to return</p>
<p>him the hundred francs he had just given her son.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, monsieur!&quot; she said, &quot;the blessings of a mother will follow you</p>
<p>wherever you go, and in all your enterprises.&quot;</p>
<p>Poor woman! she now had the supreme delight of seeing her son well-</p>
<p>dressed, and she gave him a gold watch, the price of which she had</p>
<p>saved by economy, as the reward of his good conduct.</p>
<p>&quot;You draw for the conscription next week,&quot; she said, &quot;and to prepare,</p>
<p>in case you get a bad number, I have been to see your uncle Cardot. He</p>
<p>is very much pleased with you; and so delighted to know you are a</p>
<p>second clerk at twenty, and to hear of your successful examination at</p>
<p>the law-school, that he promised me the money for a substitute. Are</p>
<p>not you glad to think that your own good conduct has brought such</p>
<p>reward? Though you have some privations to bear, remember the</p>
<p>happiness of being able, five years from now, to buy a practice. And</p>
<p>think, too, my dear little kitten, how happy you make your mother.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s face, somewhat thinned by study, had acquired, through habits</p>
<p>of business, a serious expression. He had reached his full growth, his</p>
<p>beard was thriving; adolescence had given place to virility. The</p>
<p>mother could not refrain from admiring her son and kissing him, as she</p>
<p>said:--</p>
<p>&quot;Amuse yourself, my dear boy, but remember the advice of our good</p>
<p>Monsieur Godeschal. Ah! by the bye, I was nearly forgetting! Here&#x27;s a</p>
<p>present our friend Moreau sends you. See! what a pretty pocket-book.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I want it, too; for the master gave me five hundred francs to get</p>
<p>that cursed judgment of Vandernesse versus Vandernesse, and I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>want to leave that sum of money in my room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, surely, you are not going to carry it with you!&quot; exclaimed his</p>
<p>mother, in alarm. &quot;Suppose you should lose a sum like that! Hadn&#x27;t you</p>
<p>better give it to Monsieur Godeschal for safe keeping?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Godeschal!&quot; cried Oscar, who thought his mother&#x27;s suggestion</p>
<p>excellent.</p>
<p>But Godeschal, who, like all clerks, has his time to himself on</p>
<p>Sundays, from ten to two o&#x27;clock, had already departed.</p>
<p>When his mother left him, Oscar went to lounge upon the boulevards</p>
<p>until it was time to go to Georges Marest&#x27;s breakfast. Why not display</p>
<p>those beautiful clothes which he wore with a pride and joy which all</p>
<p>young fellows who have been pinched for means in their youth will</p>
<p>remember. A pretty waistcoat with a blue ground and a palm-leaf</p>
<p>pattern, a pair of black cashmere trousers pleated, a black coat very</p>
<p>well fitting, and a cane with a gilt top, the cost of which he had</p>
<p>saved himself, caused a natural joy to the poor lad, who thought of</p>
<p>his manner of dress on the day of that journey to Presles, as the</p>
<p>effect that Georges had then produced upon him came back to his mind.</p>
<p>Oscar had before him the perspective of a day of happiness; he was to</p>
<p>see the gay world at last! Let us admit that a clerk deprived of</p>
<p>enjoyments, though longing for dissipation, was likely to let his</p>
<p>unchained senses drive the wise counsels of his mother and Godeschal</p>
<p>completely out of his mind. To the shame of youth let it be added that</p>
<p>good advice is never lacking to it. In the matter of Georges, Oscar</p>
<p>himself had a feeling of aversion for him; he felt humiliated before a</p>
<p>witness of that scene in the salon at Presles when Moreau had flung</p>
<p>him at the count&#x27;s feet. The moral senses have their laws, which are</p>
<p>implacable, and we are always punished for disregarding them. There is</p>
<p>one in particular, which the animals themselves obey without</p>
<p>discussion, and invariably; it is that which tells us to avoid those</p>
<p>who have once injured us, with or without intention, voluntarily or</p>
<p>involuntarily. The creature from whom we receive either damage or</p>
<p>annoyance will always be displeasing to us. Whatever may be his rank</p>
<p>or the degree of affection in which he stands to us, it is best to</p>
<p>break away from him; for our evil genius has sent him to us. Though</p>
<p>the Christian sentiment is opposed to it, obedience to this terrible</p>
<p>law is essentially social and conservative. The daughter of James II.,</p>
<p>who seated herself upon her father&#x27;s throne, must have caused him many</p>
<p>a wound before that usurpation. Judas had certainly given some</p>
<p>murderous blow to Jesus before he betrayed him. We have within us an</p>
<p>inward power of sight, an eye of the soul which foresees catastrophes;</p>
<p>and the repugnance that comes over us against the fateful being is the</p>
<p>result of that foresight. Though religion orders us to conquer it,</p>
<p>distrust remains, and its voice is forever heard. Would Oscar, at</p>
<p>twenty years of age, have the wisdom to listen to it?</p>
<p>Alas! when, at half-past two o&#x27;clock, Oscar entered the salon of the</p>
<p>Rocher de Cancale,--where were three invited persons besides the</p>
<p>clerks, to wit: an old captain of dragoons, named Giroudeau; Finot, a</p>
<p>journalist who might procure an engagement for Florentine at the</p>
<p>Opera, and du Bruel, an author, the friend of Tullia, one of</p>
<p>Mariette&#x27;s rivals,--the second clerk felt his secret hostility vanish</p>
<p>at the first handshaking, the first dashes of conversation as they sat</p>
<p>around a table luxuriously served. Georges, moreover, made himself</p>
<p>charming to Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve taken to private diplomacy,&quot; he said; &quot;for what difference is</p>
<p>there between a lawyer and an ambassador? only that between a nation</p>
<p>and an individual. Ambassadors are the attorneys of Peoples. If I can</p>
<p>ever be useful to you, let me know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Oscar, &quot;I&#x27;ll admit to you now that you once did me a very</p>
<p>great harm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pooh!&quot; said Georges, after listening to the explanation for which he</p>
<p>asked; &quot;it was Monsieur de Serizy who behaved badly. His wife! I</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t have her at any price; neither would I like to be in the</p>
<p>count&#x27;s red skin, minister of State and peer of France as he is. He</p>
<p>has a small mind, and I don&#x27;t care a fig for him now.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar listened with true pleasure to these slurs on the count, for</p>
<p>they diminished, in a way, the importance of his fault; and he echoed</p>
<p>the spiteful language of the ex-notary, who amused himself by</p>
<p>predicting the blows to the nobility of which the bourgeoisie were</p>
<p>already dreaming,--blows which were destined to become a reality in</p>
<ol start="1830">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>At half-past three the solid eating of the feast began; the dessert</p>
<p>did not appear till eight o&#x27;clock,--each course having taken two hours</p>
<p>to serve. None but clerks can eat like that! The stomachs of eighteen</p>
<p>and twenty are inexplicable to the medical art. The wines were worthy</p>
<p>of Borrel, who in those days had superseded the illustrious Balaine,</p>
<p>the creator of the first restaurant for delicate and perfectly</p>
<p>prepared food in Paris,--that is to say, the whole world.</p>
<p>The report of this Belshazzar&#x27;s feast for the architriclino-basochien</p>
<p>register was duly drawn up, beginning, &quot;Inter pocula aurea</p>
<p>restauranti, qui vulgo dicitur Rupes Cancali.&quot; Every one can imagine</p>
<p>the fine page now added to the Golden Book of jurisprudential</p>
<p>festivals.</p>
<p>Godeschal disappeared after signing the report, leaving the eleven</p>
<p>guests, stimulated by the old captain of the Imperial Guard, to the</p>
<p>wines, toasts, and liqueurs of a dessert composed of choice and early</p>
<p>fruits, in pyramids that rivalled the obelisk of Thebes. By half-past</p>
<p>ten the little sub-clerk was in such a state that Georges packed him</p>
<p>into a coach, paid his fare, and gave the address of his mother to the</p>
<p>driver. The remaining ten, all as drunk as Pitt and Dundas, talked of</p>
<p>going on foot along the boulevards, considering the fine evening, to</p>
<p>the house of the Marquise de las Florentinas y Cabirolos, where, about</p>
<p>midnight, they might expect to find the most brilliant society of</p>
<p>Paris. They felt the need of breathing the pure air into their lungs;</p>
<p>but, with the exception of Georges, Giroudeau, du Bruel, and Finot,</p>
<p>all four accustomed to Parisian orgies, not one of the party could</p>
<p>walk. Consequently, Georges sent to a livery-stable for three open</p>
<p>carriages, in which he drove his company for an hour round the</p>
<p>exterior boulevards from Monmartre to the Barriere du Trone. They</p>
<p>returned by Bercy, the quays, and the boulevards to the rue de</p>
<p>Vendome.</p>
<p>The clerks were fluttering still in the skies of fancy to which youth</p>
<p>is lifted by intoxication, when their amphitryon introduced them into</p>
<p>Florentine&#x27;s salon. There sparkled a bevy of stage princesses, who,</p>
<p>having been informed, no doubt, of Frederic&#x27;s joke, were amusing</p>
<p>themselves by imitating the women of good society. They were then</p>
<p>engaged in eating ices. The wax-candles flamed in the candelabra.</p>
<p>Tullia&#x27;s footmen and those of Madame du Val-Noble and Florine, all in</p>
<p>full livery, where serving the dainties on silver salvers. The</p>
<p>hangings, a marvel of Lyonnaise workmanship, fastened by gold cords,</p>
<p>dazzled all eyes. The flowers of the carpet were like a garden. The</p>
<p>richest &quot;bibelots&quot; and curiosities danced before the eyes of the new-</p>
<p>comers.</p>
<p>At first, and in the state to which Georges had brought them, the</p>
<p>clerks, and more particularly Oscar, believed in the Marquise de las</p>
<p>Florentinas y Cabirolos. Gold glittered on four card-tables in the</p>
<p>bed-chamber. In the salon, the women were playing at vingt-et-un, kept</p>
<p>by Nathan, the celebrated author.</p>
<p>After wandering, tipsy and half asleep, through the dark exterior</p>
<p>boulevards, the clerks now felt that they had wakened in the palace of</p>
<p>Armida. Oscar, presented to the marquise by Georges, was quite</p>
<p>stupefied, and did not recognize the danseuse he had seen at the</p>
<p>Gaiete, in this lady, aristocratically decolletee and swathed in</p>
<p>laces, till she looked like the vignette of a keepsake, who received</p>
<p>him with manners and graces the like of which was neither in the</p>
<p>memory nor the imagination of a young clerk rigidly brought up. After</p>
<p>admiring the splendors of the apartment and the beautiful women there</p>
<p>displayed, who had all outdone each other in their dress for this</p>
<p>occasion, Oscar was taken by the hand and led by Florentine to a</p>
<p>vingt-et-un table.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me present you,&quot; she said, &quot;to the beautiful Marquise d&#x27;Anglade,</p>
<p>one of my nearest friends.&quot;</p>
<p>And she took Oscar to the pretty Fanny Beaupre, who had just made</p>
<p>herself a reputation at the Porte-Saint-Martin, in a melodrama</p>
<p>entitled &quot;La Famille d&#x27;Anglade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear,&quot; said Florentine, &quot;allow me to present to you a charming</p>
<p>youth, whom you can take as a partner in the game.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! that will be delightful,&quot; replied the actress, smiling, as she</p>
<p>looked at Oscar. &quot;I am losing. Shall we go shares, monsieur?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame la marquise, I am at your orders,&quot; said Oscar, sitting down</p>
<p>beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;Put down the money; I&#x27;ll play; you shall being me luck! See, here are</p>
<p>my last hundred francs.&quot;</p>
<p>And the &quot;marquise&quot; took out from her purse, the rings of which were</p>
<p>adorned with diamonds, five gold pieces. Oscar pulled out his hundred</p>
<p>in silver five-franc pieces, much ashamed at having to mingle such</p>
<p>ignoble coins with gold. In ten throws the actress lost the two</p>
<p>hundred francs.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! how stupid!&quot; she cried. &quot;I&#x27;m banker now. But we&#x27;ll play together</p>
<p>still, won&#x27;t we?&quot;</p>
<p>Fanny Beaupre rose to take her place as banker, and Oscar, finding</p>
<p>himself observed by the whole table, dared not retire on the ground</p>
<p>that he had no money. Speech failed him, and his tongue clove to the</p>
<p>roof of his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Lend me five hundred francs,&quot; said the actress to the danseuse.</p>
<p>Florentine brought the money, which she obtained from Georges, who had</p>
<p>just passed eight times at ecarte.</p>
<p>&quot;Nathan has won twelve hundred francs,&quot; said the actress to Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Bankers always win; we won&#x27;t let them fool us, will we?&quot; she</p>
<p>whispered in his ear.</p>
<p>Persons of nerve, imagination, and dash will understand how it was</p>
<p>that poor Oscar opened his pocket-book and took out the note of five</p>
<p>hundred francs which Desroches had given him. He looked at Nathan, the</p>
<p>distinguished author, who now began, with Florine, to play a heavy</p>
<p>game against the bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, my little man, take &#x27;em up,&quot; cried Fanny Beaupre, signing to</p>
<p>Oscar to rake in the two hundred francs which Nathan and Florine had</p>
<p>punted.</p>
<p>The actress did not spare taunts or jests on those who lost. She</p>
<p>enlivened the game with jokes which Oscar thought singular; but</p>
<p>reflection was stifled by joy; for the first two throws produced a</p>
<p>gain of two thousand francs. Oscar then thought of feigning illness</p>
<p>and making his escape, leaving his partner behind him; but &quot;honor&quot;</p>
<p>kept him there. Three more turns and the gains were lost. Oscar felt a</p>
<p>cold sweat running down his back, and he was sobered completely.</p>
<p>The next two throws carried off the thousand francs of their mutual</p>
<p>stake. Oscar was consumed with thirst, and drank three glasses of iced</p>
<p>punch one after the other. The actress now led him into the bed-</p>
<p>chamber, where the rest of the company were playing, talking</p>
<p>frivolities with an easy air. But by this time the sense of his wrong-</p>
<p>doing overcame him; the figure of Desroches appeared to him like a</p>
<p>vision. He turned aside to a dark corner and sat down, putting his</p>
<p>handkerchief to his eyes, and wept. Florentine noticed the attitude of</p>
<p>true grief, which, because it is sincere, is certain to strike the eye</p>
<p>of one who acts. She ran to him, took the handkerchief from his hand,</p>
<p>and saw his tears; then she led him into a boudoir alone.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it, my child?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>At the tone and accent of that voice Oscar recognized a motherly</p>
<p>kindness which is often found in women of her kind, and he answered</p>
<p>openly:--</p>
<p>&quot;I have lost five hundred francs which my employer gave me to obtain a</p>
<p>document to-morrow morning; there&#x27;s nothing for me but to fling myself</p>
<p>into the river; I am dishonored.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How silly you are!&quot; she said. &quot;Stay where you are; I&#x27;ll get you a</p>
<p>thousand francs and you can win back what you&#x27;ve lost; but don&#x27;t risk</p>
<p>more than five hundred, so that you may be sure of your master&#x27;s</p>
<p>money. Georges plays a fine game at ecarte; bet on him.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar, frightened by his position, accepted the offer of the mistress</p>
<p>of the house.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; he thought, &quot;it is only women of rank who are capable of such</p>
<p>kindness. Beautiful, noble, rich! how lucky Georges is!&quot;</p>
<p>He received the thousand francs from Florentine and returned to bet on</p>
<p>his hoaxer. Georges had just passed for the fourth time when Oscar sat</p>
<p>down beside him. The other players saw with satisfaction the arrival</p>
<p>of a new better; for all, with the instinct of gamblers, took the side</p>
<p>of Giroudeau, the old officer of the Empire.</p>
<p>&quot;Messieurs,&quot; said Georges, &quot;you&#x27;ll be punished for deserting me; I</p>
<p>feel in the vein. Come, Oscar, we&#x27;ll make an end of them!&quot;</p>
<p>Georges and his partner lost five games running. After losing the</p>
<p>thousand francs Oscar was seized with the fury of play and insisted on</p>
<p>taking the cards himself. By the result of a chance not at all</p>
<p>uncommon with those who play for the first time, he won. But Georges</p>
<p>bewildered him with advice; told him when to throw the cards, and even</p>
<p>snatched them from his hand; so that this conflict of wills and</p>
<p>intuitions injured his vein. By three o&#x27;clock in the morning, after</p>
<p>various changes of fortune, and still drinking punch, Oscar came down</p>
<p>to his last hundred francs. He rose with a heavy head, completely</p>
<p>stupefied, took a few steps forward, and fell upon a sofa in the</p>
<p>boudoir, his eyes closing in a leaden sleep.</p>
<p>&quot;Mariette,&quot; said Fanny Beaupre to Godeschal&#x27;s sister, who had come in</p>
<p>about two o&#x27;clock, &quot;do you dine here to-morrow? Camusot and Pere</p>
<p>Cardot are coming, and we&#x27;ll have some fun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; cried Florentine, &quot;and my old fellow never told me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He said he&#x27;d tell you to-morrow morning,&quot; remarked Fanny Beaupre.</p>
<p>&quot;The devil take him and his orgies!&quot; exclaimed Florentine. &quot;He and</p>
<p>Camusot are worse than magistrates or stage-managers. But we have very</p>
<p>good dinners here, Mariette,&quot; she continued. &quot;Cardot always orders</p>
<p>them from Chevet&#x27;s; bring your Duc de Maufrigneuse and we&#x27;ll make them</p>
<p>dance like Tritons.&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing the names of Cardot and Camusot, Oscar made an effort to throw</p>
<p>off his sleep; but he could only mutter a few words which were not</p>
<p>understood, and then he fell back upon the silken cushions.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll have to keep him here all night,&quot; said Fanny Beaupre,</p>
<p>laughing, to Florentine.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! poor boy! he is drunk with punch and despair both. It is the</p>
<p>second clerk in your brother&#x27;s office,&quot; she said to Mariette. &quot;He has</p>
<p>lost the money his master gave him for some legal affair. He wanted to</p>
<p>drown himself; so I lent him a thousand francs, but those brigands</p>
<p>Finot and Giroudeau won them from him. Poor innocent!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we ought to wake him,&quot; said Mariette. &quot;My brother won&#x27;t make</p>
<p>light of it, nor his master either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, wake him if you can, and carry him off with you!&quot; said</p>
<p>Florentine, returning to the salon to receive the adieux of some</p>
<p>departing guests.</p>
<p>Presently those who remained began what was called &quot;character</p>
<p>dancing,&quot; and by the time it was broad daylight, Florentine, tired</p>
<p>out, went to bed, oblivious to Oscar, who was still in the boudoir</p>
<p>sound asleep.</p>
<p>CHAPTER X</p>
<p>ANOTHER CATASTROPHE</p>
<p>About eleven the next morning, a terrible sound awoke the unfortunate</p>
<p>clerk. Recognizing the voice of his uncle Cardot, he thought it wise</p>
<p>to feign sleep, and so turned his face into the yellow velvet cushions</p>
<p>on which he had passed the night.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, my little Florentine,&quot; said the old gentleman, &quot;this is</p>
<p>neither right nor sensible; you danced last evening in &#x27;Les Ruines,&#x27;</p>
<p>and you have spent the night in an orgy. That&#x27;s deliberately going to</p>
<p>work to lose your freshness. Besides which, it was ungrateful to</p>
<p>inaugurate this beautiful apartment without even letting me know. Who</p>
<p>knows what has been going on here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Old monster!&quot; cried Florentine, &quot;haven&#x27;t you a key that lets you in</p>
<p>at all hours? My ball lasted till five in the morning, and you have</p>
<p>the cruelty to come and wake me up at eleven!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Half-past eleven, Titine,&quot; observed Cardot, humbly. &quot;I came out early</p>
<p>to order a dinner fit for an archbishop at Chevet&#x27;s. Just see how the</p>
<p>carpets are stained! What sort of people did you have here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You needn&#x27;t complain, for Fanny Beaupre told me you were coming to</p>
<p>dinner with Camusot, and to please you I&#x27;ve invited Tullia, du Bruel,</p>
<p>Mariette, the Duc de Maufrigneuse, Florine, and Nathan. So you&#x27;ll have</p>
<p>the four loveliest creatures ever seen behind the foot-lights; we&#x27;ll</p>
<p>dance you a &#x27;pas de Zephire.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is enough to kill you to lead such a life!&quot; cried old Cardot; &quot;and</p>
<p>look at the broken glasses! What pillage! The antechamber actually</p>
<p>makes me shudder--&quot;</p>
<p>At this instant the wrathful old gentleman stopped short as if</p>
<p>magnetized, like a bird which a snake is charming. He saw the outline</p>
<p>of a form in a black coat through the door of the boudoir.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, Mademoiselle Cabirolle!&quot; he said at last.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>The eyes of the danseuse followed those of the little old man; and</p>
<p>when she recognized the presence of the clerk she went off into such</p>
<p>fits of laughter that not only was the old gentleman nonplussed, but</p>
<p>Oscar was compelled to appear; for Florentine took him by the arm,</p>
<p>still pealing with laughter at the conscience-stricken faces of the</p>
<p>uncle and nephew.</p>
<p>&quot;You here, nephew?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nephew! so he&#x27;s your nephew?&quot; cried Florentine, with another burst of</p>
<p>laughter. &quot;You never told me about him. Why didn&#x27;t Mariette carry you</p>
<p>off?&quot; she said to Oscar, who stood there petrified. &quot;What can he do</p>
<p>now, poor boy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever he pleases!&quot; said Cardot, sharply, marching to the door as</p>
<p>if to go away.</p>
<p>&quot;One moment, papa Cardot. You will be so good as to get your nephew</p>
<p>out of a scrape into which I led him; for he played the money of his</p>
<p>master and lost it, and I lend him a thousand francs to win it back,</p>
<p>and he lost that too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miserable boy! you lost fifteen hundred francs at play at your age?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, uncle, uncle!&quot; cried poor Oscar, plunged by these words into all</p>
<p>the horrors of his position, and falling on his knees before his</p>
<p>uncle, with clasped hands, &quot;It is twelve o&#x27;clock! I am lost,</p>
<p>dishonored! Monsieur Desroches will have no pity! He gave me the money</p>
<p>for an important affair, in which his pride was concerned. I was to</p>
<p>get a paper at the Palais in the case of Vandernesse versus</p>
<p>Vandernesse! What will become of me? Oh, save me for the sake of my</p>
<p>father and aunt! Come with me to Monsieur Desroches, and explain it to</p>
<p>him; make some excuse,--anything!&quot;</p>
<p>These sentences were jerked out through sobs and tears that might have</p>
<p>moved the sphinx of Luxor.</p>
<p>&quot;Old skinflint!&quot; said the danseuse, who was crying, &quot;will you let your</p>
<p>own nephew be dishonored,--the son of the man to whom you owe your</p>
<p>fortune?--for his name is Oscar Husson. Save him, or Titine will deny</p>
<p>you forever!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how did he come here?&quot; asked Cardot.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you see that the reason he forgot to go for those papers was</p>
<p>because he was drunk and overslept himself. Georges and his cousin</p>
<p>Frederic took all the clerks in his office to a feast at the Rocher de</p>
<p>Cancale.&quot;</p>
<p>Pere Cardot looked at Florentine and hesitated.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, come,&quot; she said, &quot;you old monkey, shouldn&#x27;t I have hid him</p>
<p>better if there had been anything else in it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There, take your five hundred francs, you scamp!&quot; said Cardot to his</p>
<p>nephew, &quot;and remember, that&#x27;s the last penny you&#x27;ll ever get from me.</p>
<p>Go and make it up with your master if you can. I&#x27;ll return the</p>
<p>thousand francs which you borrowed of mademoiselle; but I&#x27;ll never</p>
<p>hear another word about you.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar disappeared, not wishing to hear more. Once in the street,</p>
<p>however, he knew not where to go.</p>
<p>Chance which destroys men and chance which saves them were both making</p>
<p>equal efforts for and against Oscar during that fateful morning. But</p>
<p>he was doomed to fall before a master who forgave no failure in any</p>
<p>affair he had once undertaken. When Mariette reached home that night,</p>
<p>she felt alarmed at what might happen to the youth in whom her brother</p>
<p>took interest and she wrote a hasty note to Godeschal, telling him</p>
<p>what had happened to Oscar and inclosing a bank bill for five hundred</p>
<p>francs to repair his loss. The kind-hearted creature went to sleep</p>
<p>after charging her maid to carry the little note to Desroches&#x27; office</p>
<p>before seven o&#x27;clock in the morning. Godeschal, on his side, getting</p>
<p>up at six and finding that Oscar had not returned, guessed what had</p>
<p>happened. He took the five hundred francs from his own little hoard</p>
<p>and rushed to the Palais, where he obtained a copy of the judgment and</p>
<p>returned in time to lay it before Desroches by eight o&#x27;clock.</p>
<p>Meantime Desroches, who always rose at four, was in his office by</p>
<p>seven. Mariette&#x27;s maid, not finding the brother of her mistress in his</p>
<p>bedroom, came down to the office and there met Desroches, to whom she</p>
<p>very naturally offered the note.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it about business?&quot; he said; &quot;I am Monsieur Desroches.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can see, monsieur,&quot; replied the maid.</p>
<p>Desroches opened the letter and read it. Finding the five-hundred-</p>
<p>franc note, he went into his private office furiously angry with his</p>
<p>second clerk. About half-past seven he heard Godeschal dictating to</p>
<p>the second head-clerk a copy of the document in question, and a few</p>
<p>moments later the good fellow entered his master&#x27;s office with an air</p>
<p>of triumph in his heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Did Oscar Husson fetch the paper this morning from Simon?&quot; inquired</p>
<p>Desroches.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who gave him the money?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you did, Saturday,&quot; replied Godeschal.</p>
<p>&quot;Then it rains five-hundred-franc notes,&quot; cried Desroches. &quot;Look here,</p>
<p>Godeschal, you are a fine fellow, but that little Husson does not</p>
<p>deserve such generosity. I hate idiots, but I hate still more the men</p>
<p>who will go wrong in spite of the fatherly care which watches over</p>
<p>them.&quot; He gave Godeschal Mariette&#x27;s letter and the five-hundred-franc</p>
<p>note which she had sent. &quot;You must excuse my having opened it,&quot; he</p>
<p>said, &quot;but your sister&#x27;s maid told me it was on business. Dismiss</p>
<p>Husson.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor unhappy boy! what grief he has caused me! &quot; said Godeschal,</p>
<p>&quot;that tall ne&#x27;er-do-well of a Georges Marest is his evil genius; he</p>
<p>ought to flee him like the plague; if not, he&#x27;ll bring him to some</p>
<p>third disgrace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; asked Desroches.</p>
<p>Godeschal then related briefly the affair of the journey to Presles.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! yes,&quot; said the lawyer, &quot;I remember Joseph Bridau told me that</p>
<p>story about the time it happened. It is to that meeting that we owe</p>
<p>the favor Monsieur de Serizy has since shown in the matter of Joseph&#x27;s</p>
<p>brother, Philippe Bridau.&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment Moreau, to whom the case of the Vandernesse estate was</p>
<p>of much importance, entered the office. The marquis wished to sell the</p>
<p>land in parcels and the count was opposed to such a sale. The land-</p>
<p>agent received therefore the first fire of Desroches&#x27; wrath against</p>
<p>his ex-second clerk and all the threatening prophecies which he</p>
<p>fulminated against him. The result was that this most sincere friend</p>
<p>and protector of the unhappy youth came to the conclusion that his</p>
<p>vanity was incorrigible.</p>
<p>&quot;Make him a barrister,&quot; said Desroches. &quot;He has only his last</p>
<p>examination to pass. In that line, his defects might prove virtues,</p>
<p>for self-love and vanity give tongues to half the attorneys.&quot;</p>
<p>At this time Clapart, who was ill, was being nursed by his wife,--a</p>
<p>painful task, a duty without reward. The sick man tormented the poor</p>
<p>creature, who was now doomed to learn what venomous and spiteful</p>
<p>teasing a half-imbecile man, whom poverty had rendered craftily</p>
<p>savage, could be capable of in the weary tete-a-tete of each endless</p>
<p>day. Delighted to turn a sharpened arrow in the sensitive heart of the</p>
<p>mother, he had, in a measure, studied the fears that Oscar&#x27;s behavior</p>
<p>and defects inspired in the poor woman. When a mother receives from</p>
<p>her child a shock like that of the affair at Presles, she continues in</p>
<p>a state of constant fear, and, by the manner in which his wife boasted</p>
<p>of Oscar every time he obtained the slightest success, Clapart knew</p>
<p>the extent of her secret uneasiness, and he took pains to rouse it on</p>
<p>every occasion.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Madame,&quot; Clapart would say, &quot;Oscar is doing better than I even</p>
<p>hoped. That journey to Presles was only a heedlessness of youth. Where</p>
<p>can you find young lads who do not commit just such faults? Poor</p>
<p>child! he bears his privations heroically! If his father had lived, he</p>
<p>would never have had any. God grant he may know how to control his</p>
<p>passions!&quot; etc., etc.</p>
<p>While all these catastrophes were happening in the rue de Vendome and</p>
<p>the rue de Bethisy, Clapart, sitting in the chimney corner, wrapped in</p>
<p>an old dressing-gown, watched his wife, who was engaged over the fire</p>
<p>in their bedroom in simultaneously making the family broth, Clapart&#x27;s</p>
<p>&quot;tisane,&quot; and her own breakfast.</p>
<p>&quot;Mon Dieu! I wish I knew how the affair of yesterday ended. Oscar was</p>
<p>to breakfast at the Rocher de Cancale and spend the evening with a</p>
<p>marquise--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t trouble yourself! Sooner or later you&#x27;ll find out about your</p>
<p>swan,&quot; said her husband. &quot;Do you really believe in that marquise?</p>
<p>Pooh! A young man who has senses and a taste for extravagance like</p>
<p>Oscar can find such ladies as that on every bush--if he pays for them.</p>
<p>Some fine morning you&#x27;ll find yourself with a load of debt on your</p>
<p>back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are always trying to put me in despair!&quot; cried Madame Clapart.</p>
<p>&quot;You complained that my son lived on your salary, and never has he</p>
<p>cost you a penny. For two years you haven&#x27;t had the slightest cause of</p>
<p>complaint against him; here he is second clerk, his uncle and Monsieur</p>
<p>Moreau pay all expenses, and he earns, himself, a salary of eight</p>
<p>hundred francs. If we have bread to eat in our old age we may owe it</p>
<p>all to that dear boy. You are really too unjust--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You call my foresight unjust, do you?&quot; replied the invalid, crossly.</p>
<p>Just then the bell rang loudly. Madame Clapart ran to open the door,</p>
<p>and remained in the outer room with Moreau, who had come to soften the</p>
<p>blow which Oscar&#x27;s new folly would deal to the heart of his poor</p>
<p>mother.</p>
<p>&quot;What! he gambled with the money of the office?&quot; she cried, bursting</p>
<p>into tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Didn&#x27;t I tell you so, hey?&quot; said Clapart, appearing like a spectre at</p>
<p>the door of the salon whither his curiosity had brought him.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! what shall we do with him?&quot; said Madame Clapart, whose grief made</p>
<p>her impervious to Clapart&#x27;s taunt.</p>
<p>&quot;If he bore my name,&quot; replied Moreau, &quot;I should wait composedly till</p>
<p>he draws for the conscription, and if he gets a fatal number I should</p>
<p>not provide him with a substitute. This is the second time your son</p>
<p>has committed a folly out of sheer vanity. Well, vanity may inspire</p>
<p>fine deeds in war and may advance him in the career of a soldier.</p>
<p>Besides, six years of military service will put some lead into his</p>
<p>head; and as he has only his last legal examination to pass, it won&#x27;t</p>
<p>be much ill-luck for him if he doesn&#x27;t become a lawyer till he is</p>
<p>twenty-six; that is, if he wants to continue in the law after paying,</p>
<p>as they say, his tax of blood. By that time, at any rate, he will have</p>
<p>been severely punished, he will have learned experience, and</p>
<p>contracted habits of subordination. Before making his probation at the</p>
<p>bar he will have gone through his probations in life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If that is your decision for a son,&quot; said Madame Clapart, &quot;I see that</p>
<p>the heart of a father is not like that of a mother. My poor Oscar a</p>
<p>common soldier!--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you rather he flung himself headforemost into the Seine after</p>
<p>committing a dishonorable action? He cannot now become a solicitor; do</p>
<p>you think him steady and wise enough to be a barrister? No. While his</p>
<p>reason is maturing, what will he become? A dissipated fellow. The</p>
<p>discipline of the army will, at least, preserve him from that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could he not go into some other office? His uncle Cardot has promised</p>
<p>to pay for his substitute; Oscar is to dedicate his graduating thesis</p>
<p>to him.&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment carriage-wheels were heard, and a hackney-coach</p>
<p>containing Oscar and all his worldly belongings stopped before the</p>
<p>door. The luckless young man came up at once.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! here you are, Monsieur Joli-Coeur!&quot; cried Clapart.</p>
<p>Oscar kissed his mother, and held out to Moreau a hand which the</p>
<p>latter refused to take. To this rebuff Oscar replied by a reproachful</p>
<p>look, the boldness of which he had never shown before. Then he turned</p>
<p>on Clapart.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to me, monsieur,&quot; said the youth, transformed into a man. &quot;You</p>
<p>worry my poor mother devilishly, and that&#x27;s your right, for she is,</p>
<p>unfortunately, your wife. But as for me, it is another thing. I shall</p>
<p>be of age in a few months; and you have no rights over me even as a</p>
<p>minor. I have never asked anything of you. Thanks to Monsieur Moreau,</p>
<p>I have never cost you one penny, and I owe you no gratitude.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say, let me alone!&quot;</p>
<p>Clapart, hearing this apostrophe, slunk back to his sofa in the</p>
<p>chimney corner. The reasoning and the inward fury of the young man,</p>
<p>who had just received a lecture from his friend Godeschal, silenced</p>
<p>the imbecile mind of the sick man.</p>
<p>&quot;A momentary temptation, such as you yourself would have yielded to at</p>
<p>my age,&quot; said Oscar to Moreau, &quot;has made me commit a fault which</p>
<p>Desroches thinks serious, though it is only a peccadillo. I am more</p>
<p>provoked with myself for taking Florentine of the Gaiete for a</p>
<p>marquise than I am for losing fifteen hundred francs after a little</p>
<p>debauch in which everybody, even Godeschal, was half-seas over. This</p>
<p>time, at any rate, I&#x27;ve hurt no one by myself. I&#x27;m cured of such</p>
<p>things forever. If you are willing to help me, Monsieur Moreau, I</p>
<p>swear to you that the six years I must still stay a clerk before I can</p>
<p>get a practice shall be spent without--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop there!&quot; said Moreau. &quot;I have three children, and I can make no</p>
<p>promises.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind, never mind,&quot; said Madame Clapart to her son, casting a</p>
<p>reproachful glance at Moreau. &quot;Your uncle Cardot--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no longer an uncle Cardot,&quot; replied Oscar, who related the</p>
<p>scene at the rue de Vendome.</p>
<p>Madame Clapart, feeling her legs give way under the weight of her</p>
<p>body, staggered to a chair in the dining-room, where she fell as if</p>
<p>struck by lightning.</p>
<p>&quot;All the miseries together!&quot; she said, as she fainted.</p>
<p>Moreau took the poor mother in his arms, and carried her to the bed in</p>
<p>her chamber. Oscar remained motionless, as if crushed.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing left for you,&quot; said Moreau, coming back to him, &quot;but</p>
<p>to make yourself a soldier. That idiot of a Clapart looks to me as</p>
<p>though he couldn&#x27;t live three months, and then your mother will be</p>
<p>without a penny. Ought I not, therefore, to reserve for her the little</p>
<p>money I am able to give? It was impossible to tell you this before</p>
<p>her. As a soldier, you&#x27;ll eat plain bread and reflect on life such as</p>
<p>it is to those who are born into it without fortune.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I may get a lucky number,&quot; said Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose you do, what then? Your mother has well fulfilled her duty</p>
<p>towards you. She gave you an education; she placed you on the right</p>
<p>road, and secured you a career. You have left it. Now, what can you</p>
<p>do? Without money, nothing; as you know by this time. You are not a</p>
<p>man who can begin a new career by taking off your coat and going to</p>
<p>work in your shirt-sleeves with the tools of an artisan. Besides, your</p>
<p>mother loves you, and she would die to see you come to that.&quot;</p>
<p>Oscar sat down and no longer restrained his tears, which flowed</p>
<p>copiously. At last he understood this language, so completely</p>
<p>unintelligible to him ever since his first fault.</p>
<p>&quot;Men without means ought to be perfect,&quot; added Moreau, not suspecting</p>
<p>the profundity of that cruel sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;My fate will soon be decided,&quot; said Oscar. &quot;I draw my number the day</p>
<p>after to-morrow. Between now and then I will decide upon my future.&quot;</p>
<p>Moreau, deeply distressed in spite of his stern bearing, left the</p>
<p>household in the rue de la Cerisaie to its despair.</p>
<p>Three days later Oscar drew the number twenty-seven. In the interests</p>
<p>of the poor lad the former steward of Presles had the courage to go to</p>
<p>the Comte de Serizy and ask for his influence to get Oscar into the</p>
<p>cavalry. It happened that the count&#x27;s son, having left the Ecole</p>
<p>Polytechnique rather low in his class, was appointed, as a favor, sub-</p>
<p>lieutenant in a regiment of cavalry commanded by the Duc de</p>
<p>Maufrigneuse. Oscar had, therefore, in his great misfortune, the small</p>
<p>luck of being, at the Comte de Serizy&#x27;s instigation, drafted into that</p>
<p>noble regiment, with the promise of promotion to quartermaster within</p>
<p>a year. Chance had thus placed the ex-clerk under the command of the</p>
<p>son of the Comte de Serizy.</p>
<p>Madame Clapart, after languishing for some days, so keenly was she</p>
<p>affected by these catastrophes, became a victim to the remorse which</p>
<p>seizes upon many a mother whose conduct has been frail in her youth,</p>
<p>and who, in her old age, turns to repentance. She now considered</p>
<p>herself under a curse. She attributed the sorrows of her second</p>
<p>marriage and the misfortunes of her son to a just retribution by which</p>
<p>God was compelling her to expiate the errors and pleasures of her</p>
<p>youth. This opinion soon became a certainty in her mind. The poor</p>
<p>woman went, for the first time in forty years, to confess herself to</p>
<p>the Abbe Gaudron, vicar of Saint-Paul&#x27;s, who led her into the practice</p>
<p>of devotion. But so ill-used and loving a soul as that of Madame</p>
<p>Clapart&#x27;s could never be anything but simply pious. The Aspasia of the</p>
<p>Directory wanted to expiate her sins in order to draw down the</p>
<p>blessing of God on the head of her poor Oscar, and she henceforth</p>
<p>vowed herself to works and deeds of the purest piety. She believed she</p>
<p>had won the attention of heaven when she saved the life of Monsieur</p>
<p>Clapart, who, thanks to her devotion, lived on to torture her; but she</p>
<p>chose to see, in the tyranny of that imbecile mind, a trial inflicted</p>
<p>by the hand of one who loveth while he chasteneth.</p>
<p>Oscar, meantime, behaved so well that in 1830 he was first sergeant of</p>
<p>the company of the Vicomte de Serizy, which gave him the rank of sub-</p>
<p>lieutenant of the line. Oscar Husson was by that time twenty-five</p>
<p>years old. As the Royal Guard, to which his regiment was attached, was</p>
<p>always in garrison in Paris, or within a circumference of thirty miles</p>
<p>around the capital, he came to see his mother from time to time, and</p>
<p>tell her his griefs; for he had the sense to see that he could never</p>
<p>become an officer as matters then were. At that time the cavalry</p>
<p>grades were all being taken up by the younger sons of noble families,</p>
<p>and men without the article to their names found promotion difficult.</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s sole ambition was to leave the Guards and be appointed sub-</p>
<p>lieutenant in a regiment of the cavalry of the line. In the month of</p>
<p>February, 1830, Madame Clapart obtained this promotion for her son</p>
<p>through the influence of Madame la Dauphine, granted to the Abbe</p>
<p>Gaudron, now rector of Saint-Pauls.</p>
<p>Although Oscar outwardly professed to be devoted to the Bourbons, in</p>
<p>the depths of his heart he was a liberal. Therefore, in the struggle</p>
<p>of 1830, he went over to the side of the people. This desertion, which</p>
<p>had an importance due to the crisis in which it took place, brought</p>
<p>him before the eyes of the public. During the excitement of triumph in</p>
<p>the month of August he was promoted lieutenant, received the cross of</p>
<p>the Legion of honor, and was attached as aide-de-camp to La Fayette,</p>
<p>who gave him the rank of captain in 1832. When the amateur of the best</p>
<p>of all possible republics was removed from the command of the National</p>
<p>guard, Oscar Husson, whose devotion to the new dynasty amounted to</p>
<p>fanaticism, was appointed major of a regiment sent to Africa at the</p>
<p>time of the first expedition undertaken by the Prince-royal. The</p>
<p>Vicomte de Serizy chanced to be the lieutenant-colonel of this</p>
<p>regiment. At the affair of the Makta, where the field had to be</p>
<p>abandoned to the Arabs, Monsieur de Serizy was left wounded under a</p>
<p>dead horse. Oscar, discovering this, called out to the squadron:</p>
<p>&quot;Messieurs, it is going to death, but we cannot abandon our colonel.&quot;</p>
<p>He dashed upon the enemy, and his electrified soldiers followed him.</p>
<p>The Arabs, in their first astonishment at this furious and unlooked-</p>
<p>for return, allowed Oscar to seize the viscount, whom he flung across</p>
<p>his horse, and carried off at full gallop,--receiving, as he did so,</p>
<p>two slashes from yataghans on his left arm.</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s conduct on this occasion was rewarded with the officer&#x27;s cross</p>
<p>of the Legion of honor, and by his promotion to the rank of</p>
<p>lieutenant-colonel. He took the most affectionate care of the Vicomte</p>
<p>de Serizy, whose mother came to meet him on the arrival of the</p>
<p>regiment at Toulon, where, as we know, the young man died of his</p>
<p>wounds.</p>
<p>The Comtesse de Serizy had not separated her son from the man who had</p>
<p>shown him such devotion. Oscar himself was so seriously wounded that</p>
<p>the surgeons whom the countess had brought with her from Paris thought</p>
<p>best to amputate his left arm.</p>
<p>Thus the Comte de Serizy was led not only to forgive Oscar for his</p>
<p>painful remarks on the journey to Presles, but to feel himself his</p>
<p>debtor on behalf of his son, now buried in the chapel of the chateau</p>
<p>de Serizy.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>OSCAR&#x27;S LAST BLUNDER</p>
<p>Some years after the affair at Makta, an old lady, dressed in black,</p>
<p>leaning on the arm of a man about thirty-four years of age, in whom</p>
<p>observers would recognize a retired officer, from the loss of an arm</p>
<p>and the rosette of the Legion of honor in his button-hole, was</p>
<p>standing, at eight o&#x27;clock, one morning in the month of May, under the</p>
<p>porte-cochere of the Lion d&#x27;Argent, rue de Faubourg Saint-Denis,</p>
<p>waiting, apparently, for the departure of a diligence. Undoubtedly</p>
<p>Pierrotin, the master of the line of coaches running through the</p>
<p>valley of the Oise (despatching one through Saint-Leu-Taverny and</p>
<p>Isle-Adam to Beaumont), would scarcely have recognized in this bronzed</p>
<p>and maimed officer the little Oscar Husson he had formerly taken to</p>
<p>Presles. Madame Husson, at last a widow, was as little recognizable as</p>
<p>her son. Clapart, a victim of Fieschi&#x27;s machine, had served his wife</p>
<p>better by death than by all his previous life. The idle lounger was</p>
<p>hanging about, as usual, on the boulevard du Temple, gazing at the</p>
<p>show, when the explosion came. The poor widow was put upon the pension</p>
<p>list, made expressly for the families of the victim, at fifteen</p>
<p>hundred francs a year.</p>
<p>The coach, to which were harnessed four iron-gray horses that would</p>
<p>have done honor to the Messageries-royales, was divided into three</p>
<p>compartments, coupe, interieur, and rotonde, with an imperiale above.</p>
<p>It resembled those diligences called &quot;Gondoles,&quot; which now ply, in</p>
<p>rivalry with the railroad, between Paris and Versailles. Both solid</p>
<p>and light, well-painted and well-kept, lined with fine blue cloth, and</p>
<p>furnished with blinds of a Moorish pattern and cushions of red</p>
<p>morocco, the &quot;Swallow of the Oise&quot; could carry, comfortably, nineteen</p>
<p>passengers. Pierrotin, now about fifty-six years old, was little</p>
<p>changed. Still dressed in a blue blouse, beneath which he wore a black</p>
<p>suit, he smoked his pipe, and superintended the two porters in livery,</p>
<p>who were stowing away the luggage in the great imperiale.</p>
<p>&quot;Are your places taken?&quot; he said to Madame Clapart and Oscar, eyeing</p>
<p>them like a man who is trying to recall a likeness to his memory.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, two places for the interieur in the name of my servant,</p>
<p>Bellejambe,&quot; replied Oscar; &quot;he must have taken them last evening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! monsieur is the new collector of Beaumont,&quot; said Pierrotin. &quot;You</p>
<p>take the place of Monsieur Margueron&#x27;s nephew?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Oscar, pressing the arm of his mother, who was about to</p>
<p>speak.</p>
<p>The officer wished to remain unknown for a time.</p>
<p>Just then Oscar thrilled at hearing the well-remembered voice of</p>
<p>Georges Marest calling out from the street: &quot;Pierrotin, have you one</p>
<p>seat left?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me you could say &#x27;monsieur&#x27; without cracking your</p>
<p>throat,&quot; replied the master of the line of coaches of the Valley of</p>
<p>the Oise, sharply.</p>
<p>Unless by the sound of the voice, Oscar could never have recognized</p>
<p>the individual whose jokes had been so fatal to him. Georges, almost</p>
<p>bald, retained only three or four tufts of hair above his ears; but</p>
<p>these were elaborately frizzed out to conceal, as best they could, the</p>
<p>nakedness of the skull. A fleshiness ill-placed, in other words, a</p>
<p>pear-shaped stomach, altered the once elegant proportions of the ex-</p>
<p>young man. Now almost ignoble in appearance and bearing, Georges</p>
<p>exhibited the traces of disasters in love and a life of debauchery in</p>
<p>his blotched skin and bloated, vinous features. The eyes had lost the</p>
<p>brilliancy, the vivacity of youth which chaste or studious habits have</p>
<p>the virtue to retain. Dressed like a man who is careless of his</p>
<p>clothes, Georges wore a pair of shabby trousers, with straps intended</p>
<p>for varnished boots; but his were of leather, thick-soled, ill-</p>
<p>blacked, and of many months&#x27; wear. A faded waistcoat, a cravat,</p>
<p>pretentiously tied, although the material was a worn-out foulard,</p>
<p>bespoke the secret distress to which a former dandy sometimes falls a</p>
<p>prey. Moreover, Georges appeared at this hour of the morning in an</p>
<p>evening coat, instead of a surtout; a sure diagnostic of actual</p>
<p>poverty. This coat, which had seen long service at balls, had now,</p>
<p>like its master, passed from the opulent ease of former times to daily</p>
<p>work. The seams of the black cloth showed whitening lines; the collar</p>
<p>was greasy; long usage had frayed the edges of the sleeves into</p>
<p>fringes.</p>
<p>And yet, Georges ventured to attract attention by yellow kid gloves,</p>
<p>rather dirty, it is true, on the outside of which a signet ring</p>
<p>defined a large dark spot. Round his cravat, which was slipped into a</p>
<p>pretentious gold ring, was a chain of silk, representing hair, which,</p>
<p>no doubt, held a watch. His hat, though worn rather jauntily,</p>
<p>revealed, more than any of the above symptoms, the poverty of a man</p>
<p>who was totally unable to pay sixteen francs to a hat-maker, being</p>
<p>forced to live from hand to mouth. The former admirer of Florentine</p>
<p>twirled a cane with a chased gold knob, which was horribly battered.</p>
<p>The blue trousers, the waistcoat of a material called &quot;Scotch stuff,&quot;</p>
<p>a sky-blue cravat and a pink-striped cotton shirt, expressed, in the</p>
<p>midst of all this ruin, such a latent desire to SHOW-OFF that the</p>
<p>contrast was not only a sight to see, but a lesson to be learned.</p>
<p>&quot;And that is Georges!&quot; said Oscar, in his own mind,--&quot;a man I left in</p>
<p>possession of thirty thousand francs a year!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has Monsieur DE Pierrotin a place in the coupe?&quot; asked Georges,</p>
<p>ironically replying to Pierrotin&#x27;s rebuff.</p>
<p>&quot;No; my coupe is taken by a peer of France, the son-in-law of Monsieur</p>
<p>Moreau, Monsieur le Baron de Canalis, his wife, and his mother-in-law.</p>
<p>I have nothing left but one place in the interieur.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The devil! so peers of France still travel in your coach, do they?&quot;</p>
<p>said Georges, remembering his adventure with the Comte de Serizy.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;ll take that place in the interieur.&quot;</p>
<p>He cast a glance of examination on Oscar and his mother, but did not</p>
<p>recognize them.</p>
<p>Oscar&#x27;s skin was now bronzed by the sun of Africa; his moustache was</p>
<p>very thick and his whiskers ample; the hollows in his cheeks and his</p>
<p>strongly marked features were in keeping with his military bearing.</p>
<p>The rosette of an officer of the Legion of honor, his missing arm, the</p>
<p>strict propriety of his dress, would all have diverted Georges</p>
<p>recollections of his former victim if he had had any. As for Madame</p>
<p>Clapart, whom Georges had scarcely seen, ten years devoted to the</p>
<p>exercise of the most severe piety had transformed her. No one would</p>
<p>ever have imagined that that gray sister concealed the Aspasia of</p>
<ol start="1797">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>An enormous old man, very simply dressed, though his clothes were good</p>
<p>and substantial, in whom Oscar recognized Pere Leger, here came slowly</p>
<p>and heavily along. He nodded familiarly to Pierrotin, who appeared by</p>
<p>his manner to pay him the respect due in all lands to millionaires.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! ha! why, here&#x27;s Pere Leger! more and more preponderant!&quot; cried</p>
<p>Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;To whom have I the honor of speaking?&quot; asked old Leger, curtly.</p>
<p>&quot;What! you don&#x27;t recognize Colonel Georges, the friend of Ali pacha?</p>
<p>We travelled together once upon a time, in company with the Comte de</p>
<p>Serizy.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the habitual follies of those who have fallen in the world is</p>
<p>to recognize and desire the recognition of others.</p>
<p>&quot;You are much changed,&quot; said the ex-farmer, now twice a millionaire.</p>
<p>&quot;All things change,&quot; said Georges. &quot;Look at the Lion d&#x27;Argent and</p>
<p>Pierrotin&#x27;s coach; they are not a bit like what they were fourteen</p>
<p>years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pierrotin now controls the whole service of the Valley of the Oise,&quot;</p>
<p>replied Monsieur Leger, &quot;and sends out five coaches. He is the</p>
<p>bourgeois of Beaumont, where he keeps a hotel, at which all the</p>
<p>diligences stop, and he has a wife and daughter who are not a bad help</p>
<p>to him.&quot;</p>
<p>An old man of seventy here came out of the hotel and joined the group</p>
<p>of travellers who were waiting to get into the coach.</p>
<p>&quot;Come along, Papa Reybert,&quot; said Leger, &quot;we are only waiting now for</p>
<p>your great man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here he comes,&quot; said the steward of Presles, pointing to Joseph</p>
<p>Bridau.</p>
<p>Neither Georges nor Oscar recognized the illustrious artist, for his</p>
<p>face had the worn and haggard lines that were now famous, and his</p>
<p>bearing was that which is given by success. The ribbon of the Legion</p>
<p>of honor adorned his black coat, and the rest of his dress, which was</p>
<p>extremely elegant, seemed to denote an expedition to some rural fete.</p>
<p>At this moment a clerk, with a paper in his hand, came out of the</p>
<p>office (which was now in the former kitchen of the Lion d&#x27;Argent), and</p>
<p>stood before the empty coupe.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur and Madame de Canalis, three places,&quot; he said. Then, moving</p>
<p>to the door of the interieur, he named, consecutively, &quot;Monsieur</p>
<p>Bellejambe, two places; Monsieur de Reybert, three places; Monsieur--</p>
<p>your name, if you please?&quot; he said to Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Georges Marest,&quot; said the fallen man, in a low voice.</p>
<p>The clerk then moved to the rotunde, before which were grouped a</p>
<p>number of nurses, country-people, and petty shopkeepers, who were</p>
<p>bidding each other adieu. Then, after bundling in the six passengers,</p>
<p>he called to four young men who mounted to the imperial; after which</p>
<p>he cried: &quot;Start!&quot; Pierrotin got up beside his driver, a young man in</p>
<p>a blouse, who called out: &quot;Pull!&quot; to his animals, and the vehicle,</p>
<p>drawn by four horses brought at Roye, mounted the rise of the faubourg</p>
<p>Saint-Denis at a slow trot.</p>
<p>But no sooner had it got above Saint-Laurent than it raced like a</p>
<p>mail-cart to Saint-Denis, which it reached in forty minutes. No stop</p>
<p>was made at the cheese-cake inn, and the coach took the road through</p>
<p>the valley of Montmorency.</p>
<p>It was at the turn into this road that Georges broke the silence which</p>
<p>the travellers had so far maintained while observing each other.</p>
<p>&quot;We go a little faster than we did fifteen years ago, hey, Pere</p>
<p>Leger?&quot; he said, pulling out a silver watch.</p>
<p>&quot;Persons are usually good enough to call me Monsieur Leger,&quot; said the</p>
<p>millionaire.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, here&#x27;s our blagueur of the famous journey to Presles,&quot; cried</p>
<p>Joseph Bridau. &quot;Have you made any new campaigns in Asia, Africa, or</p>
<p>America?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sacrebleu! I&#x27;ve made the revolution of July, and that&#x27;s enough for</p>
<p>me, for it ruined me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you made the revolution of July!&quot; cried the painter, laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I always said it never made itself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How people meet again!&quot; said Monsieur Leger, turning to Monsieur de</p>
<p>Reybert. &quot;This, papa Reybert, is the clerk of the notary to whom you</p>
<p>undoubtedly owe the stewardship of Presles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We lack Mistigris, now famous under his own name of Leon de Lora,&quot;</p>
<p>said Joseph Bridau, &quot;and the little young man who was stupid enough to</p>
<p>talk to the count about those skin diseases which are now cured, and</p>
<p>about his wife, whom he has recently left that he may die in peace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the count himself, you lack him,&quot; said old Reybert.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid,&quot; said Joseph Bridau, sadly, &quot;that the last journey the</p>
<p>count will ever take will be from Presles to Isle-Adam, to be present</p>
<p>at my marriage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He still drives about the park,&quot; said Reybert.</p>
<p>&quot;Does his wife come to see him?&quot; asked Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;Once a month,&quot; replied Reybert. &quot;She is never happy out of Paris.</p>
<p>Last September she married her niece, Mademoiselle du Rouvre, on whom,</p>
<p>since the death of her son, she spends all her affection, to a very</p>
<p>rich young Pole, the Comte Laginski.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To whom,&quot; asked Madame Clapart, &quot;will Monsieur de Serizy&#x27;s property</p>
<p>go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To his wife, who will bury him,&quot; replied Georges. &quot;The countess is</p>
<p>still fine-looking for a woman of fifty-four years of age. She is very</p>
<p>elegant, and, at a little distance, gives one the illusion--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She will always be an illusion to you,&quot; said Leger, who seemed</p>
<p>inclined to revenge himself on his former hoaxer.</p>
<p>&quot;I respect her,&quot; said Georges. &quot;But, by the bye, what became of that</p>
<p>steward whom the count turned off?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Moreau?&quot; said Leger; &quot;why, he&#x27;s the deputy from the Oise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! the famous Centre man; Moreau de l&#x27;Oise?&quot; cried Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; returned Leger, &quot;Moreau de l&#x27;Oise. He did more than you for the</p>
<p>revolution of July, and he has since then bought the beautiful estate</p>
<p>of Pointel, between Presles and Beaumont.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next to the count&#x27;s,&quot; said Georges. &quot;I call that very bad taste.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t speak so loud,&quot; said Monsieur de Reybert, &quot;for Madame Moreau</p>
<p>and her daughter, the Baronne de Canalis, and the Baron himself, the</p>
<p>former minister, are in the coupe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What &#x27;dot&#x27; could he have given his daughter to induce our great</p>
<p>orator to marry her?&quot; said Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;Something like two millions,&quot; replied old Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;He always had a taste for millions,&quot; remarked Georges. &quot;He began his</p>
<p>pile surreptitiously at Presles--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say nothing against Monsieur Moreau,&quot; cried Oscar, hastily. &quot;You</p>
<p>ought to have learned before now to hold your tongue in public</p>
<p>conveyances.&quot;</p>
<p>Joseph Bridau looked at the one-armed officer for several seconds;</p>
<p>then he said, smiling:--</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur is not an ambassador, but his rosette tells us he has made</p>
<p>his way nobly; my brother and General Giroudeau have repeatedly named</p>
<p>him in their reports.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oscar Husson!&quot; cried Georges. &quot;Faith! if it hadn&#x27;t been for your</p>
<p>voice I should never have known you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! it was monsieur who so bravely rescued the Vicomte Jules de</p>
<p>Serizy from the Arabs?&quot; said Reybert, &quot;and for whom the count has</p>
<p>obtained the collectorship of Beaumont while awaiting that of</p>
<p>Pontoise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, monsieur,&quot; said Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you will give me the pleasure, monsieur,&quot; said the great</p>
<p>painter, &quot;of being present at my marriage at Isle-Adam.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whom do you marry?&quot; asked Oscar, after accepting the invitation.</p>
<p>&quot;Mademoiselle Leger,&quot; replied Joseph Bridau, &quot;the granddaughter of</p>
<p>Monsieur de Reybert. Monsieur le comte was kind enough to arrange the</p>
<p>marriage for me. As an artist I owe him a great deal, and he wished,</p>
<p>before his death, to secure my future, about which I did not think,</p>
<p>myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whom did Pere Leger marry?&quot; asked Georges.</p>
<p>&quot;My daughter,&quot; replied Monsieur de Reybert, &quot;and without a &#x27;dot.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Georges, assuming a more respectful manner toward Monsieur</p>
<p>Leger, &quot;I am fortunate in having chosen this particular day to do the</p>
<p>valley of the Oise. You can all be useful to me, gentlemen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How so?&quot; asked Monsieur Leger.</p>
<p>&quot;In this way,&quot; replied Georges. &quot;I am employed by the &#x27;Esperance,&#x27; a</p>
<p>company just formed, the statutes of which have been approved by an</p>
<p>ordinance of the King. This institution gives, at the end of ten</p>
<p>years, dowries to young girls, annuities to old men; it pays the</p>
<p>education of children, and takes charge, in short, of the fortunes of</p>
<p>everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can well believe it,&quot; said Pere Leger, smiling. &quot;In a word, you are</p>
<p>a runner for an insurance company.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, monsieur. I am the inspector-general; charged with the duty of</p>
<p>establishing correspondents and appointing the agents of the company</p>
<p>throughout France. I am only operating until the agents are selected;</p>
<p>for it is a matter as delicate as it is difficult to find honest</p>
<p>agents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how did you lose your thirty thousand a year?&quot; asked Oscar.</p>
<p>&quot;As you lost your arm,&quot; replied the son of Czerni-Georges, curtly.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you must have shared in some brilliant action,&quot; remarked Oscar,</p>
<p>with a sarcasm not unmixed with bitterness.</p>
<p>&quot;Parbleu! I&#x27;ve too many--shares! that&#x27;s just what I wanted to sell.&quot;</p>
<p>By this time they had arrived at Saint-Leu-Taverny, where all the</p>
<p>passengers got out while the coach changed horses. Oscar admired the</p>
<p>liveliness which Pierrotin displayed in unhooking the traces from the</p>
<p>whiffle-trees, while his driver cleared the reins from the leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;Poor Pierrotin,&quot; thought he; &quot;he has stuck like me,--not far advanced</p>
<p>in the world. Georges has fallen low. All the others, thanks to</p>
<p>speculation and to talent, have made their fortune. Do we breakfast</p>
<p>here, Pierrotin?&quot; he said, aloud, slapping that worthy on the</p>
<p>shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not the driver,&quot; said Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you, then?&quot; asked Colonel Husson.</p>
<p>&quot;The proprietor,&quot; replied Pierrotin.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, don&#x27;t be vexed with an old acquaintance,&quot; said Oscar, motioning</p>
<p>to his mother, but still retaining his patronizing manner. &quot;Don&#x27;t you</p>
<p>recognize Madame Clapart?&quot;</p>
<p>It was all the nobler of Oscar to present his mother to Pierrotin,</p>
<p>because, at that moment, Madame Moreau de l&#x27;Oise, getting out of the</p>
<p>coupe, overheard the name, and stared disdainfully at Oscar and his</p>
<p>mother.</p>
<p>&quot;My faith! madame,&quot; said Pierrotin, &quot;I should never have known you;</p>
<p>nor you, either, monsieur; the sun burns black in Africa, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>The species of pity which Oscar thus felt for Pierrotin was the last</p>
<p>blunder that vanity ever led our hero to commit, and, like his other</p>
<p>faults, it was punished, but very gently, thus:--</p>
<p>Two months after his official installation at Beaumont-sur-Oise, Oscar</p>
<p>was paying his addresses to Mademoiselle Georgette Pierrotin, whose</p>
<p>&#x27;dot&#x27; amounted to one hundred and fifty thousand francs, and he</p>
<p>married the pretty daughter of the proprietor of the stage-coaches of</p>
<p>the Oise, toward the close of the winter of 1838.</p>
<p>The adventure of the journey to Presles was a lesson to Oscar Husson</p>
<p>in discretion; his disaster at Florentine&#x27;s card-party strengthened</p>
<p>him in honesty and uprightness; the hardships of his military career</p>
<p>taught him to understand the social hierarchy and to yield obedience</p>
<p>to his lot. Becoming wise and capable, he was happy. The Comte de</p>
<p>Serizy, before his death, obtained for him the collectorship at</p>
<p>Pontoise. The influence of Monsieur Moreau de l&#x27;Oise and that of the</p>
<p>Comtesse de Serizy and the Baron de Canalis secured, in after years, a</p>
<p>receiver-generalship for Monsieur Husson, in whom the Camusot family</p>
<p>now recognize a relation.</p>
<p>Oscar is a commonplace man, gentle, without assumption, modest, and</p>
<p>always keeping, like his government, to a middle course. He excites</p>
<p>neither envy nor contempt. In short, he is the modern bourgeois.</p>
