(1807-1882)</p>
<p>Incipit Comoedia Dantis Alagherii,
Florentini natione, non moribus.</p>
<p>The Divine Comedy
translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>
<p>INFERNO</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto I</p>
<p>Midway upon the journey of our life
I found myself within a forest dark,
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</p>
<p>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
Which in the very thought renews the fear.</p>
<p>So bitter is it, death is little more;
But of the good to treat, which there I found,
Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</p>
<p>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
So full was I of slumber at the moment
In which I had abandoned the true way.</p>
<p>But after I had reached a mountain&#x27;s foot,
At that point where the valley terminated,
Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</p>
<p>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,
Vested already with that planet&#x27;s rays
Which leadeth others right by every road.</p>
<p>Then was the fear a little quieted
That in my heart&#x27;s lake had endured throughout
The night, which I had passed so piteously.</p>
<p>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,
Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,
Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</p>
<p>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,
Turn itself back to re-behold the pass
Which never yet a living person left.</p>
<p>After my weary body I had rested,
The way resumed I on the desert slope,
So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</p>
<p>And lo! almost where the ascent began,
A panther light and swift exceedingly,
Which with a spotted skin was covered o&#x27;er!</p>
<p>And never moved she from before my face,
Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
That many times I to return had turned.</p>
<p>The time was the beginning of the morning,
And up the sun was mounting with those stars
That with him were, what time the Love Divine</p>
<p>At first in motion set those beauteous things;
So were to me occasion of good hope,
The variegated skin of that wild beast,</p>
<p>The hour of time, and the delicious season;
But not so much, that did not give me fear
A lion&#x27;s aspect which appeared to me.</p>
<p>He seemed as if against me he were coming
With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</p>
<p>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings
Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</p>
<p>She brought upon me so much heaviness,
With the affright that from her aspect came,
That I the hope relinquished of the height.</p>
<p>And as he is who willingly acquires,
And the time comes that causes him to lose,
Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</p>
<p>E&#x27;en such made me that beast withouten peace,
Which, coming on against me by degrees
Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.</p>
<p>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,
Before mine eyes did one present himself,
Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</p>
<p>When I beheld him in the desert vast,
&quot;Have pity on me,&quot; unto him I cried,
&quot;Whiche&#x27;er thou art, or shade or real man!&quot;</p>
<p>He answered me: &quot;Not man; man once I was,
And both my parents were of Lombardy,
And Mantuans by country both of them.</p>
<p>&#x27;Sub Julio&#x27; was I born, though it was late,
And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,
During the time of false and lying gods.</p>
<p>A poet was I, and I sang that just
Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,
After that Ilion the superb was burned.</p>
<p>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?
Why climb&#x27;st thou not the Mount Delectable,
Which is the source and cause of every joy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain
Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?&quot;
I made response to him with bashful forehead.</p>
<p>&quot;O, of the other poets honour and light,
Avail me the long study and great love
That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</p>
<p>Thou art my master, and my author thou,
Thou art alone the one from whom I took
The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</p>
<p>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;
Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,
For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thee it behoves to take another road,&quot;
Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,
&quot;If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</p>
<p>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,
Suffers not any one to pass her way,
But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</p>
<p>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,
That never doth she glut her greedy will,
And after food is hungrier than before.</p>
<p>Many the animals with whom she weds,
And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound
Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</p>
<p>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;
&#x27;Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</p>
<p>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,
On whose account the maid Camilla died,
Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</p>
<p>Through every city shall he hunt her down,
Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,
There from whence envy first did let her loose.</p>
<p>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best
Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,
And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</p>
<p>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,
Who cry out each one for the second death;</p>
<p>And thou shalt see those who contented are
Within the fire, because they hope to come,
Whene&#x27;er it may be, to the blessed people;</p>
<p>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,
A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;
With her at my departure I will leave thee;</p>
<p>Because that Emperor, who reigns above,
In that I was rebellious to his law,
Wills that through me none come into his city.</p>
<p>He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;
There is his city and his lofty throne;
O happy he whom thereto he elects!&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;Poet, I thee entreat,
By that same God whom thou didst never know,
So that I may escape this woe and worse,</p>
<p>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,
That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,
And those thou makest so disconsolate.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto II</p>
<p>Day was departing, and the embrowned air
Released the animals that are on earth
From their fatigues; and I the only one</p>
<p>Made myself ready to sustain the war,
Both of the way and likewise of the woe,
Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</p>
<p>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!
O memory, that didst write down what I saw,
Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</p>
<p>And I began: &quot;Poet, who guidest me,
Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,
Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</p>
<p>Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent,
While yet corruptible, unto the world
Immortal went, and was there bodily.</p>
<p>But if the adversary of all evil
Was courteous, thinking of the high effect
That issue would from him, and who, and what,</p>
<p>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;
For he was of great Rome, and of her empire
In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</p>
<p>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,
Were stablished as the holy place, wherein
Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</p>
<p>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,
Things did he hear, which the occasion were
Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</p>
<p>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,
To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,
Which of salvation&#x27;s way is the beginning.</p>
<p>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?
I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,
Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,
I fear the coming may be ill-advised;
Thou&#x27;rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.&quot;</p>
<p>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,
And by new thoughts doth his intention change,
So that from his design he quite withdraws,</p>
<p>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,
Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,
Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;If I have well thy language understood,&quot;
Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,
&quot;Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</p>
<p>Which many times a man encumbers so,
It turns him back from honoured enterprise,
As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</p>
<p>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,
I&#x27;ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard
At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</p>
<p>Among those was I who are in suspense,
And a fair, saintly Lady called to me
In such wise, I besought her to command me.</p>
<p>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;
And she began to say, gentle and low,
With voice angelical, in her own language:</p>
<p>&#x27;O spirit courteous of Mantua,
Of whom the fame still in the world endures,
And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</p>
<p>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,
Upon the desert slope is so impeded
Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</p>
<p>And may, I fear, already be so lost,
That I too late have risen to his succour,
From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</p>
<p>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,
And with what needful is for his release,
Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</p>
<p>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;
I come from there, where I would fain return;
Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</p>
<p>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,
Full often will I praise thee unto him.&#x27;
Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</p>
<p>&#x27;O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom
The human race exceedeth all contained
Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,</p>
<p>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,
To obey, if &#x27;twere already done, were late;
No farther need&#x27;st thou ope to me thy wish.</p>
<p>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun
The here descending down into this centre,
From the vast place thou burnest to return to.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,
Briefly will I relate,&#x27; she answered me,
&#x27;Why I am not afraid to enter here.</p>
<p>Of those things only should one be afraid
Which have the power of doing others harm;
Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</p>
<p>God in his mercy such created me
That misery of yours attains me not,
Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</p>
<p>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves
At this impediment, to which I send thee,
So that stern judgment there above is broken.</p>
<p>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,
And said, &quot;Thy faithful one now stands in need
Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,
Hastened away, and came unto the place
Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</p>
<p>&quot;Beatrice&quot; said she, &quot;the true praise of God,
Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,
For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</p>
<p>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?
Dost thou not see the death that combats him
Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?&quot;</p>
<p>Never were persons in the world so swift
To work their weal and to escape their woe,
As I, after such words as these were uttered,</p>
<p>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,
Confiding in thy dignified discourse,
Which honours thee, and those who&#x27;ve listened to it.&#x27;</p>
<p>After she thus had spoken unto me,
Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;
Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</p>
<p>And unto thee I came, as she desired;
I have delivered thee from that wild beast,
Which barred the beautiful mountain&#x27;s short ascent.</p>
<p>What is it, then?  Why, why dost thou delay?
Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?
Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</p>
<p>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight
Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,
And so much good my speech doth promise thee?&quot;</p>
<p>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,
Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,
Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</p>
<p>Such I became with my exhausted strength,
And such good courage to my heart there coursed,
That I began, like an intrepid person:</p>
<p>&quot;O she compassionate, who succoured me,
And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon
The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</p>
<p>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed
To the adventure, with these words of thine,
That to my first intent I have returned.</p>
<p>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,
Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.&quot;
Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</p>
<p>I entered on the deep and savage way.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto III</p>
<p>&quot;Through me the way is to the city dolent;
Through me the way is to eternal dole;
Through me the way among the people lost.</p>
<p>Justice incited my sublime Creator;
Created me divine Omnipotence,
The highest Wisdom and the primal Love.</p>
<p>Before me there were no created things,
Only eterne, and I eternal last.
All hope abandon, ye who enter in!&quot;</p>
<p>These words in sombre colour I beheld
Written upon the summit of a gate;
Whence I: &quot;Their sense is, Master, hard to me!&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me, as one experienced:
&quot;Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,
All cowardice must needs be here extinct.</p>
<p>We to the place have come, where I have told thee
Thou shalt behold the people dolorous
Who have foregone the good of intellect.&quot;</p>
<p>And after he had laid his hand on mine
With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,
He led me in among the secret things.</p>
<p>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud
Resounded through the air without a star,
Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</p>
<p>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,
Accents of anger, words of agony,
And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</p>
<p>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on
For ever in that air for ever black,
Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</p>
<p>And I, who had my head with horror bound,
Said: &quot;Master, what is this which now I hear?
What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;This miserable mode
Maintain the melancholy souls of those
Who lived withouten infamy or praise.</p>
<p>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir
Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,
Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.</p>
<p>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;
Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,
For glory none the damned would have from them.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;O Master, what so grievous is
To these, that maketh them lament so sore?&quot;
He answered: &quot;I will tell thee very briefly.</p>
<p>These have no longer any hope of death;
And this blind life of theirs is so debased,
They envious are of every other fate.</p>
<p>No fame of them the world permits to be;
Misericord and Justice both disdain them.
Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.&quot;</p>
<p>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,
Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,
That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</p>
<p>And after it there came so long a train
Of people, that I ne&#x27;er would have believed
That ever Death so many had undone.</p>
<p>When some among them I had recognised,
I looked, and I beheld the shade of him
Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</p>
<p>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,
That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches
Hateful to God and to his enemies.</p>
<p>These miscreants, who never were alive,
Were naked, and were stung exceedingly
By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</p>
<p>These did their faces irrigate with blood,
Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet
By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</p>
<p>And when to gazing farther I betook me.
People I saw on a great river&#x27;s bank;
Whence said I: &quot;Master, now vouchsafe to me,</p>
<p>That I may know who these are, and what law
Makes them appear so ready to pass over,
As I discern athwart the dusky light.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;These things shall all be known
To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay
Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.&quot;</p>
<p>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,
Fearing my words might irksome be to him,
From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</p>
<p>And lo! towards us coming in a boat
An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,
Crying: &quot;Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!</p>
<p>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;
I come to lead you to the other shore,
To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</p>
<p>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,
Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!&quot;
But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</p>
<p>He said: &quot;By other ways, by other ports
Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;
A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.&quot;</p>
<p>And unto him the Guide: &quot;Vex thee not, Charon;
It is so willed there where is power to do
That which is willed; and farther question not.&quot;</p>
<p>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks
Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,
Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</p>
<p>But all those souls who weary were and naked
Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,
As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</p>
<p>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,
The human race, the place, the time, the seed
Of their engendering and of their birth!</p>
<p>Thereafter all together they drew back,
Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,
Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</p>
<p>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,
Beckoning to them, collects them all together,
Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</p>
<p>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,
First one and then another, till the branch
Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</p>
<p>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam
Throw themselves from that margin one by one,
At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</p>
<p>So they depart across the dusky wave,
And ere upon the other side they land,
Again on this side a new troop assembles.</p>
<p>&quot;My son,&quot; the courteous Master said to me,
&quot;All those who perish in the wrath of God
Here meet together out of every land;</p>
<p>And ready are they to pass o&#x27;er the river,
Because celestial Justice spurs them on,
So that their fear is turned into desire.</p>
<p>This way there never passes a good soul;
And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,
Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.&quot;</p>
<p>This being finished, all the dusk champaign
Trembled so violently, that of that terror
The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</p>
<p>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,
And fulminated a vermilion light,
Which overmastered in me every sense,</p>
<p>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto IV</p>
<p>Broke the deep lethargy within my head
A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,
Like to a person who by force is wakened;</p>
<p>And round about I moved my rested eyes,
Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,
To recognise the place wherein I was.</p>
<p>True is it, that upon the verge I found me
Of the abysmal valley dolorous,
That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</p>
<p>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,
So that by fixing on its depths my sight
Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us descend now into the blind world,&quot;
Began the Poet, pallid utterly;
&quot;I will be first, and thou shalt second be.&quot;</p>
<p>And I, who of his colour was aware,
Said: &quot;How shall I come, if thou art afraid,
Who&#x27;rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;The anguish of the people
Who are below here in my face depicts
That pity which for terror thou hast taken.</p>
<p>Let us go on, for the long way impels us.&quot;
Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter
The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</p>
<p>There, as it seemed to me from listening,
Were lamentations none, but only sighs,
That tremble made the everlasting air.</p>
<p>And this arose from sorrow without torment,
Which the crowds had, that many were and great,
Of infants and of women and of men.</p>
<p>To me the Master good: &quot;Thou dost not ask
What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?
Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,</p>
<p>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,
&#x27;Tis not enough, because they had not baptism
Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;</p>
<p>And if they were before Christianity,
In the right manner they adored not God;
And among such as these am I myself.</p>
<p>For such defects, and not for other guilt,
Lost are we and are only so far punished,
That without hope we live on in desire.&quot;</p>
<p>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,
Because some people of much worthiness
I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,&quot;
Began I, with desire of being certain
Of that Faith which o&#x27;ercometh every error,</p>
<p>&quot;Came any one by his own merit hence,
Or by another&#x27;s, who was blessed thereafter?&quot;
And he, who understood my covert speech,</p>
<p>Replied: &quot;I was a novice in this state,
When I saw hither come a Mighty One,
With sign of victory incoronate.</p>
<p>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,
And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,
Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient</p>
<p>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,
Israel with his father and his children,
And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,</p>
<p>And others many, and he made them blessed;
And thou must know, that earlier than these
Never were any human spirits saved.&quot;</p>
<p>We ceased not to advance because he spake,
But still were passing onward through the forest,
The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</p>
<p>Not very far as yet our way had gone
This side the summit, when I saw a fire
That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</p>
<p>We were a little distant from it still,
But not so far that I in part discerned not
That honourable people held that place.</p>
<p>&quot;O thou who honourest every art and science,
Who may these be, which such great honour have,
That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;The honourable name,
That sounds of them above there in thy life,
Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.&quot;</p>
<p>In the mean time a voice was heard by me:
&quot;All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;
His shade returns again, that was departed.&quot;</p>
<p>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,
Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;
Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</p>
<p>To say to me began my gracious Master:
&quot;Him with that falchion in his hand behold,
Who comes before the three, even as their lord.</p>
<p>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;
He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;
The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</p>
<p>Because to each of these with me applies
The name that solitary voice proclaimed,
They do me honour, and in that do well.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school
Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,
Who o&#x27;er the others like an eagle soars.</p>
<p>When they together had discoursed somewhat,
They turned to me with signs of salutation,
And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</p>
<p>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,
In that they made me one of their own band;
So that the sixth was I, &#x27;mid so much wit.</p>
<p>Thus we went on as far as to the light,
Things saying &#x27;tis becoming to keep silent,
As was the saying of them where I was.</p>
<p>We came unto a noble castle&#x27;s foot,
Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,
Defended round by a fair rivulet;</p>
<p>This we passed over even as firm ground;
Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;
We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</p>
<p>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,
Of great authority in their countenance;
They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</p>
<p>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side
Into an opening luminous and lofty,
So that they all of them were visible.</p>
<p>There opposite, upon the green enamel,
Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,
Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</p>
<p>I saw Electra with companions many,
&#x27;Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,
Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;</p>
<p>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea
On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,
Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;</p>
<p>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,
Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,
And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.</p>
<p>When I had lifted up my brows a little,
The Master I beheld of those who know,
Sit with his philosophic family.</p>
<p>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.
There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,
Who nearer him before the others stand;</p>
<p>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,
Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,
Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;</p>
<p>Of qualities I saw the good collector,
Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,
Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,</p>
<p>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,
Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,
Averroes, who the great Comment made.</p>
<p>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,
Because so drives me onward the long theme,
That many times the word comes short of fact.</p>
<p>The sixfold company in two divides;
Another way my sapient Guide conducts me
Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</p>
<p>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto V</p>
<p>Thus I descended out of the first circle
Down to the second, that less space begirds,
And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.</p>
<p>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;
Examines the transgressions at the entrance;
Judges, and sends according as he girds him.</p>
<p>I say, that when the spirit evil-born
Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;
And this discriminator of transgressions</p>
<p>Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it;
Girds himself with his tail as many times
As grades he wishes it should be thrust down.</p>
<p>Always before him many of them stand;
They go by turns each one unto the judgment;
They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.</p>
<p>&quot;O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry
Comest,&quot; said Minos to me, when he saw me,
Leaving the practice of so great an office,</p>
<p>&quot;Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;
Let not the portal&#x27;s amplitude deceive thee.&quot;
And unto him my Guide: &quot;Why criest thou too?</p>
<p>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;
It is so willed there where is power to do
That which is willed; and ask no further question.&quot;</p>
<p>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow
Audible unto me; now am I come
There where much lamentation strikes upon me.</p>
<p>I came into a place mute of all light,
Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,
If by opposing winds &#x27;t is combated.</p>
<p>The infernal hurricane that never rests
Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;
Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</p>
<p>When they arrive before the precipice,
There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,
There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</p>
<p>I understood that unto such a torment
The carnal malefactors were condemned,
Who reason subjugate to appetite.</p>
<p>And as the wings of starlings bear them on
In the cold season in large band and full,
So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</p>
<p>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;
No hope doth comfort them for evermore,
Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</p>
<p>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,
Making in air a long line of themselves,
So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</p>
<p>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.
Whereupon said I: &quot;Master, who are those
People, whom the black air so castigates?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first of those, of whom intelligence
Thou fain wouldst have,&quot; then said he unto me,
&quot;The empress was of many languages.</p>
<p>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,
That lustful she made licit in her law,
To remove the blame to which she had been led.</p>
<p>She is Semiramis, of whom we read
That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;
She held the land which now the Sultan rules.</p>
<p>The next is she who killed herself for love,
And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;
Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.&quot;</p>
<p>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless
Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,
Who at the last hour combated with Love.</p>
<p>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand
Shades did he name and point out with his finger,
Whom Love had separated from our life.</p>
<p>After that I had listened to my Teacher,
Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,
Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</p>
<p>And I began: &quot;O Poet, willingly
Speak would I to those two, who go together,
And seem upon the wind to be so light.&quot;</p>
<p>And, he to me: &quot;Thou&#x27;lt mark, when they shall be
Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them
By love which leadeth them, and they will come.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,
My voice uplift I: &quot;O ye weary souls!
Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.&quot;</p>
<p>As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,
With open and steady wings to the sweet nest
Fly through the air by their volition borne,</p>
<p>So came they from the band where Dido is,
Approaching us athwart the air malign,
So strong was the affectionate appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;O living creature gracious and benignant,
Who visiting goest through the purple air
Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</p>
<p>If were the King of the Universe our friend,
We would pray unto him to give thee peace,
Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</p>
<p>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,
That will we hear, and we will speak to you,
While silent is the wind, as it is now.</p>
<p>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,
Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends
To rest in peace with all his retinue.</p>
<p>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,
Seized this man for the person beautiful
That was ta&#x27;en from me, and still the mode offends me.</p>
<p>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,
Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,
That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</p>
<p>Love has conducted us unto one death;
Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!&quot;
These words were borne along from them to us.</p>
<p>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,
I bowed my face, and so long held it down
Until the Poet said to me: &quot;What thinkest?&quot;</p>
<p>When I made answer, I began: &quot;Alas!
How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,
Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!&quot;</p>
<p>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,
And I began: &quot;Thine agonies, Francesca,
Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</p>
<p>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,
By what and in what manner Love conceded,
That you should know your dubious desires?&quot;</p>
<p>And she to me: &quot;There is no greater sorrow
Than to be mindful of the happy time
In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</p>
<p>But, if to recognise the earliest root
Of love in us thou hast so great desire,
I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</p>
<p>One day we reading were for our delight
Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.
Alone we were and without any fear.</p>
<p>Full many a time our eyes together drew
That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;
But one point only was it that o&#x27;ercame us.</p>
<p>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile
Being by such a noble lover kissed,
This one, who ne&#x27;er from me shall be divided,</p>
<p>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.
Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.
That day no farther did we read therein.&quot;</p>
<p>And all the while one spirit uttered this,
The other one did weep so, that, for pity,
I swooned away as if I had been dying,</p>
<p>And fell, even as a dead body falls.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto VI</p>
<p>At the return of consciousness, that closed
Before the pity of those two relations,
Which utterly with sadness had confused me,</p>
<p>New torments I behold, and new tormented
Around me, whichsoever way I move,
And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</p>
<p>In the third circle am I of the rain
Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;
Its law and quality are never new.</p>
<p>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,
Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;
Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.</p>
<p>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,
With his three gullets like a dog is barking
Over the people that are there submerged.</p>
<p>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,
And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;
He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.</p>
<p>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;
One side they make a shelter for the other;
Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.</p>
<p>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!
His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;
Not a limb had he that was motionless.</p>
<p>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,
Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,
He threw it into those rapacious gullets.</p>
<p>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,
And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,
For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,</p>
<p>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed
Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders
Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.</p>
<p>We passed across the shadows, which subdues
The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet
Upon their vanity that person seems.</p>
<p>They all were lying prone upon the earth,
Excepting one, who sat upright as soon
As he beheld us passing on before him.</p>
<p>&quot;O thou that art conducted through this Hell,&quot;
He said to me, &quot;recall me, if thou canst;
Thyself wast made before I was unmade.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;The anguish which thou hast
Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,
So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.</p>
<p>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful
A place art put, and in such punishment,
If some are greater, none is so displeasing.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Thy city, which is full
Of envy so that now the sack runs over,
Held me within it in the life serene.</p>
<p>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;
For the pernicious sin of gluttony
I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.</p>
<p>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,
For all these suffer the like penalty
For the like sin;&quot; and word no more spake he.</p>
<p>I answered him: &quot;Ciacco, thy wretchedness
Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;
But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come</p>
<p>The citizens of the divided city;
If any there be just; and the occasion
Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;They, after long contention,
Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party
Will drive the other out with much offence.</p>
<p>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall
Within three suns, and rise again the other
By force of him who now is on the coast.</p>
<p>High will it hold its forehead a long while,
Keeping the other under heavy burdens,
Howe&#x27;er it weeps thereat and is indignant.</p>
<p>The just are two, and are not understood there;
Envy and Arrogance and Avarice
Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.&quot;</p>
<p>Here ended he his tearful utterance;
And I to him: &quot;I wish thee still to teach me,
And make a gift to me of further speech.</p>
<p>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,
Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,
And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,</p>
<p>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;
For great desire constraineth me to learn
If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.&quot;</p>
<p>And he: &quot;They are among the blacker souls;
A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;
If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.</p>
<p>But when thou art again in the sweet world,
I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;</p>
<p>No more I tell thee and no more I answer.&quot;</p>
<p>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,
Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;
He fell therewith prone like the other blind.</p>
<p>And the Guide said to me: &quot;He wakes no more
This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;
When shall approach the hostile Potentate,</p>
<p>Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,
Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,
Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes.&quot;</p>
<p>So we passed onward o&#x27;er the filthy mixture
Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,
Touching a little on the future life.</p>
<p>Wherefore I said: &quot;Master, these torments here,
Will they increase after the mighty sentence,
Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Return unto thy science,
Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,
The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.</p>
<p>Albeit that this people maledict
To true perfection never can attain,
Hereafter more than now they look to be.&quot;</p>
<p>Round in a circle by that road we went,
Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;
We came unto the point where the descent is;</p>
<p>There we found Plutus the great enemy.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto VII</p>
<p>&quot;Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!&quot;
Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;
And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,</p>
<p>Said, to encourage me: &quot;Let not thy fear
Harm thee; for any power that he may have
Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,
And said: &quot;Be silent, thou accursed wolf;
Consume within thyself with thine own rage.</p>
<p>Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;
Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought
Vengeance upon the proud adultery.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as the sails inflated by the wind
Involved together fall when snaps the mast,
So fell the cruel monster to the earth.</p>
<p>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,
Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore
Which all the woe of the universe insacks.</p>
<p>Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many
New toils and sufferings as I beheld?
And why doth our transgression waste us so?</p>
<p>As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,
That breaks itself on that which it encounters,
So here the folk must dance their roundelay.</p>
<p>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,
On one side and the other, with great howls,
Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.</p>
<p>They clashed together, and then at that point
Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,
Crying, &quot;Why keepest?&quot; and, &quot;Why squanderest thou?&quot;</p>
<p>Thus they returned along the lurid circle
On either hand unto the opposite point,
Shouting their shameful metre evermore.</p>
<p>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about
Through his half-circle to another joust;
And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,</p>
<p>Exclaimed: &quot;My Master, now declare to me
What people these are, and if all were clerks,
These shaven crowns upon the left of us.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;All of them were asquint
In intellect in the first life, so much
That there with measure they no spending made.</p>
<p>Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,
Whene&#x27;er they reach the two points of the circle,
Where sunders them the opposite defect.</p>
<p>Clerks those were who no hairy covering
Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,
In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;My Master, among such as these
I ought forsooth to recognise some few,
Who were infected with these maladies.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Vain thought thou entertainest;
The undiscerning life which made them sordid
Now makes them unto all discernment dim.</p>
<p>Forever shall they come to these two buttings;
These from the sepulchre shall rise again
With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.</p>
<p>Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world
Have ta&#x27;en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;
Whate&#x27;er it be, no words adorn I for it.</p>
<p>Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce
Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,
For which the human race each other buffet;</p>
<p>For all the gold that is beneath the moon,
Or ever has been, of these weary souls
Could never make a single one repose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Master,&quot; I said to him, &quot;now tell me also
What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,
That has the world&#x27;s goods so within its clutches?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;O creatures imbecile,
What ignorance is this which doth beset you?
Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.</p>
<p>He whose omniscience everything transcends
The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,
That every part to every part may shine,</p>
<p>Distributing the light in equal measure;
He in like manner to the mundane splendours
Ordained a general ministress and guide,</p>
<p>That she might change at times the empty treasures
From race to race, from one blood to another,
Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.</p>
<p>Therefore one people triumphs, and another
Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,
Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.</p>
<p>Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;
She makes provision, judges, and pursues
Her governance, as theirs the other gods.</p>
<p>Her permutations have not any truce;
Necessity makes her precipitate,
So often cometh who his turn obtains.</p>
<p>And this is she who is so crucified
Even by those who ought to give her praise,
Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.</p>
<p>But she is blissful, and she hears it not;
Among the other primal creatures gladsome
She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.</p>
<p>Let us descend now unto greater woe;
Already sinks each star that was ascending
When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.&quot;</p>
<p>We crossed the circle to the other bank,
Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself
Along a gully that runs out of it.</p>
<p>The water was more sombre far than perse;
And we, in company with the dusky waves,
Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.</p>
<p>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,
This tristful brooklet, when it has descended
Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.</p>
<p>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,
Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,
All of them naked and with angry look.</p>
<p>They smote each other not alone with hands,
But with the head and with the breast and feet,
Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.</p>
<p>Said the good Master: &quot;Son, thou now beholdest
The souls of those whom anger overcame;
And likewise I would have thee know for certain</p>
<p>Beneath the water people are who sigh
And make this water bubble at the surface,
As the eye tells thee wheresoe&#x27;er it turns.</p>
<p>Fixed in the mire they say, &#x27;We sullen were
In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,
Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;</p>
<p>Now we are sullen in this sable mire.&#x27;
This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,
For with unbroken words they cannot say it.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen
A great arc &#x27;twixt the dry bank and the swamp,
With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;</p>
<p>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto VIII</p>
<p>I say, continuing, that long before
We to the foot of that high tower had come,
Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</p>
<p>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,
And from afar another answer them,
So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</p>
<p>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,
I said: &quot;What sayeth this, and what respondeth
That other fire? and who are they that made it?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Across the turbid waves
What is expected thou canst now discern,
If reek of the morass conceal it not.&quot;</p>
<p>Cord never shot an arrow from itself
That sped away athwart the air so swift,
As I beheld a very little boat</p>
<p>Come o&#x27;er the water tow&#x27;rds us at that moment,
Under the guidance of a single pilot,
Who shouted, &quot;Now art thou arrived, fell soul?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain
For this once,&quot; said my Lord; &quot;thou shalt not have us
Longer than in the passing of the slough.&quot;</p>
<p>As he who listens to some great deceit
That has been done to him, and then resents it,
Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</p>
<p>My Guide descended down into the boat,
And then he made me enter after him,
And only when I entered seemed it laden.</p>
<p>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,
The antique prow goes on its way, dividing
More of the water than &#x27;tis wont with others.</p>
<p>While we were running through the dead canal,
Uprose in front of me one full of mire,
And said, &quot;Who &#x27;rt thou that comest ere the hour?&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;Although I come, I stay not;
But who art thou that hast become so squalid?&quot;
&quot;Thou seest that I am one who weeps,&quot; he answered.</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;With weeping and with wailing,
Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;
For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.&quot;</p>
<p>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;
Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,
Saying, &quot;Away there with the other dogs!&quot;</p>
<p>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;
He kissed my face, and said: &quot;Disdainful soul,
Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</p>
<p>That was an arrogant person in the world;
Goodness is none, that decks his memory;
So likewise here his shade is furious.</p>
<p>How many are esteemed great kings up there,
Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,
Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;My Master, much should I be pleased,
If I could see him soused into this broth,
Before we issue forth out of the lake.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Ere unto thee the shore
Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;
Such a desire &#x27;tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.&quot;</p>
<p>A little after that, I saw such havoc
Made of him by the people of the mire,
That still I praise and thank my God for it.</p>
<p>They all were shouting, &quot;At Philippo Argenti!&quot;
And that exasperate spirit Florentine
Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</p>
<p>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;
But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,
Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</p>
<p>And the good Master said: &quot;Even now, my Son,
The city draweth near whose name is Dis,
With the grave citizens, with the great throng.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;Its mosques already, Master, clearly
Within there in the valley I discern
Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</p>
<p>They were.&quot;  And he to me: &quot;The fire eternal
That kindles them within makes them look red,
As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we arrived within the moats profound,
That circumvallate that disconsolate city;
The walls appeared to me to be of iron.</p>
<p>Not without making first a circuit wide,
We came unto a place where loud the pilot
Cried out to us, &quot;Debark, here is the entrance.&quot;</p>
<p>More than a thousand at the gates I saw
Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily
Were saying, &quot;Who is this that without death</p>
<p>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?&quot;
And my sagacious Master made a sign
Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</p>
<p>A little then they quelled their great disdain,
And said: &quot;Come thou alone, and he begone
Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</p>
<p>Let him return alone by his mad road;
Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,
Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.&quot;</p>
<p>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted
At utterance of the accursed words;
For never to return here I believed.</p>
<p>&quot;O my dear Guide, who more than seven times
Hast rendered me security, and drawn me
From imminent peril that before me stood,</p>
<p>Do not desert me,&quot; said I, &quot;thus undone;
And if the going farther be denied us,
Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.&quot;</p>
<p>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,
Said unto me: &quot;Fear not; because our passage
None can take from us, it by Such is given.</p>
<p>But here await me, and thy weary spirit
Comfort and nourish with a better hope;
For in this nether world I will not leave thee.&quot;</p>
<p>So onward goes and there abandons me
My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,
For No and Yes within my head contend.</p>
<p>I could not hear what he proposed to them;
But with them there he did not linger long,
Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</p>
<p>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,
On my Lord&#x27;s breast, who had remained without
And turned to me with footsteps far between.</p>
<p>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he
Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,
&quot;Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?&quot;</p>
<p>And unto me: &quot;Thou, because I am angry,
Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,
Whatever for defence within be planned.</p>
<p>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;
For once they used it at less secret gate,
Which finds itself without a fastening still.</p>
<p>O&#x27;er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;
And now this side of it descends the steep,
Passing across the circles without escort,</p>
<p>One by whose means the city shall be opened.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto IX</p>
<p>That hue which cowardice brought out on me,
Beholding my Conductor backward turn,
Sooner repressed within him his new colour.</p>
<p>He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,
Because the eye could not conduct him far
Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.</p>
<p>&quot;Still it behoveth us to win the fight,&quot;
Began he; &quot;Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .
O how I long that some one here arrive!&quot;</p>
<p>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning
He covered up with what came afterward,
That they were words quite different from the first;</p>
<p>But none the less his saying gave me fear,
Because I carried out the broken phrase,
Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.</p>
<p>&quot;Into this bottom of the doleful conch
Doth any e&#x27;er descend from the first grade,
Which for its pain has only hope cut off?&quot;</p>
<p>This question put I; and he answered me:
&quot;Seldom it comes to pass that one of us
Maketh the journey upon which I go.</p>
<p>True is it, once before I here below
Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,
Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.</p>
<p>Naked of me short while the flesh had been,
Before within that wall she made me enter,
To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;</p>
<p>That is the lowest region and the darkest,
And farthest from the heaven which circles all.
Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.</p>
<p>This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,
Encompasses about the city dolent,
Where now we cannot enter without anger.&quot;</p>
<p>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;
Because mine eye had altogether drawn me
Tow&#x27;rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,</p>
<p>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen
The three infernal Furies stained with blood,
Who had the limbs of women and their mien,</p>
<p>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;
Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,
Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.</p>
<p>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen
Of everlasting lamentation knew,
Said unto me: &quot;Behold the fierce Erinnys.</p>
<p>This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;
She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;
Tisiphone is between;&quot; and then was silent.</p>
<p>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;
They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,
That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.</p>
<p>&quot;Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!&quot;
All shouted looking down; &quot;in evil hour
Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,
For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,
No more returning upward would there be.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round
Himself, and trusted not unto my hands
So far as not to blind me with his own.</p>
<p>O ye who have undistempered intellects,
Observe the doctrine that conceals itself
Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!</p>
<p>And now there came across the turbid waves
The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,
Because of which both of the margins trembled;</p>
<p>Not otherwise it was than of a wind
Impetuous on account of adverse heats,
That smites the forest, and, without restraint,</p>
<p>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;
Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,
And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.</p>
<p>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: &quot;Direct the nerve
Of vision now along that ancient foam,
There yonder where that smoke is most intense.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent
Across the water scatter all abroad,
Until each one is huddled in the earth.</p>
<p>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,
Thus fleeing from before one who on foot
Was passing o&#x27;er the Styx with soles unwet.</p>
<p>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,
Waving his left hand oft in front of him,
And only with that anguish seemed he weary.</p>
<p>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,
And to the Master turned; and he made sign
That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.</p>
<p>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!
He reached the gate, and with a little rod
He opened it, for there was no resistance.</p>
<p>&quot;O banished out of Heaven, people despised!&quot;
Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;
&quot;Whence is this arrogance within you couched?</p>
<p>Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,
From which the end can never be cut off,
And which has many times increased your pain?</p>
<p>What helpeth it to butt against the fates?
Your Cerberus, if you remember well,
For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he returned along the miry road,
And spake no word to us, but had the look
Of one whom other care constrains and goads</p>
<p>Than that of him who in his presence is;
And we our feet directed tow&#x27;rds the city,
After those holy words all confident.</p>
<p>Within we entered without any contest;
And I, who inclination had to see
What the condition such a fortress holds,</p>
<p>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,
And see on every hand an ample plain,
Full of distress and torment terrible.</p>
<p>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,
Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,
That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,</p>
<p>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;
So likewise did they there on every side,
Saving that there the manner was more bitter;</p>
<p>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,
By which they so intensely heated were,
That iron more so asks not any art.</p>
<p>All of their coverings uplifted were,
And from them issued forth such dire laments,
Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.</p>
<p>And I: &quot;My Master, what are all those people
Who, having sepulture within those tombs,
Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Here are the Heresiarchs,
With their disciples of all sects, and much
More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.</p>
<p>Here like together with its like is buried;
And more and less the monuments are heated.&quot;
And when he to the right had turned, we passed</p>
<p>Between the torments and high parapets.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto X</p>
<p>Now onward goes, along a narrow path
Between the torments and the city wall,
My Master, and I follow at his back.</p>
<p>&quot;O power supreme, that through these impious circles
Turnest me,&quot; I began, &quot;as pleases thee,
Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</p>
<p>The people who are lying in these tombs,
Might they be seen? already are uplifted
The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;They all will be closed up
When from Jehoshaphat they shall return
Here with the bodies they have left above.</p>
<p>Their cemetery have upon this side
With Epicurus all his followers,
Who with the body mortal make the soul;</p>
<p>But in the question thou dost put to me,
Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,
And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;Good Leader, I but keep concealed
From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,
Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire
Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,
Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.</p>
<p>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest
A native of that noble fatherland,
To which perhaps I too molestful was.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound
From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,
Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</p>
<p>And unto me he said: &quot;Turn thee; what dost thou?
Behold there Farinata who has risen;
From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.&quot;</p>
<p>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,
And he uprose erect with breast and front
E&#x27;en as if Hell he had in great despite.</p>
<p>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader
Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,
Exclaiming, &quot;Let thy words explicit be.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb
Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,
Then asked of me, &quot;Who were thine ancestors?&quot;</p>
<p>I, who desirous of obeying was,
Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;
Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</p>
<p>Then said he: &quot;Fiercely adverse have they been
To me, and to my fathers, and my party;
So that two several times I scattered them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If they were banished, they returned on all sides,&quot;
I answered him, &quot;the first time and the second;
But yours have not acquired that art aright.&quot;</p>
<p>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered
Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;
I think that he had risen on his knees.</p>
<p>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude
He had to see if some one else were with me,
But after his suspicion was all spent,</p>
<p>Weeping, he said to me: &quot;If through this blind
Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,
Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;I come not of myself;
He who is waiting yonder leads me here,
Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.&quot;</p>
<p>His language and the mode of punishment
Already unto me had read his name;
On that account my answer was so full.</p>
<p>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: &quot;How
Saidst thou,--he had?  Is he not still alive?
Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?&quot;</p>
<p>When he became aware of some delay,
Which I before my answer made, supine
He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</p>
<p>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire
I had remained, did not his aspect change,
Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.</p>
<p>&quot;And if,&quot; continuing his first discourse,
&quot;They have that art,&quot; he said, &quot;not learned aright,
That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</p>
<p>But fifty times shall not rekindled be
The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,
Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</p>
<p>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,
Say why that people is so pitiless
Against my race in each one of its laws?&quot;</p>
<p>Whence I to him: &quot;The slaughter and great carnage
Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause
Such orisons in our temple to be made.&quot;</p>
<p>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,
&quot;There I was not alone,&quot; he said, &quot;nor surely
Without a cause had with the others moved.</p>
<p>But there I was alone, where every one
Consented to the laying waste of Florence,
He who defended her with open face.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,&quot;
I him entreated, &quot;solve for me that knot,
Which has entangled my conceptions here.</p>
<p>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,
Beforehand whatsoe&#x27;er time brings with it,
And in the present have another mode.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We see, like those who have imperfect sight,
The things,&quot; he said, &quot;that distant are from us;
So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</p>
<p>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain
Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,
Not anything know we of your human state.</p>
<p>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead
Will be our knowledge from the moment when
The portal of the future shall be closed.&quot;</p>
<p>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,
Said: &quot;Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,
That still his son is with the living joined.</p>
<p>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,
Tell him I did it because I was thinking
Already of the error you have solved me.&quot;</p>
<p>And now my Master was recalling me,
Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit
That he would tell me who was with him there.</p>
<p>He said: &quot;With more than a thousand here I lie;
Within here is the second Frederick,
And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.&quot;</p>
<p>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards
The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting
Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</p>
<p>He moved along; and afterward thus going,
He said to me, &quot;Why art thou so bewildered?&quot;
And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</p>
<p>&quot;Let memory preserve what thou hast heard
Against thyself,&quot; that Sage commanded me,
&quot;And now attend here;&quot; and he raised his finger.</p>
<p>&quot;When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet
Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,
From her thou&#x27;lt know the journey of thy life.&quot;</p>
<p>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;
We left the wall, and went towards the middle,
Along a path that strikes into a valley,</p>
<p>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XI</p>
<p>Upon the margin of a lofty bank
Which great rocks broken in a circle made,
We came upon a still more cruel throng;</p>
<p>And there, by reason of the horrible
Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,
We drew ourselves aside behind the cover</p>
<p>Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,
Which said: &quot;Pope Anastasius I hold,
Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Slow it behoveth our descent to be,
So that the sense be first a little used
To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it.&quot;</p>
<p>The Master thus; and unto him I said,
&quot;Some compensation find, that the time pass not
Idly;&quot; and he: &quot;Thou seest I think of that.</p>
<p>My son, upon the inside of these rocks,&quot;
Began he then to say, &quot;are three small circles,
From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.</p>
<p>They all are full of spirits maledict;
But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee,
Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint.</p>
<p>Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,
Injury is the end; and all such end
Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.</p>
<p>But because fraud is man&#x27;s peculiar vice,
More it displeases God; and so stand lowest
The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.</p>
<p>All the first circle of the Violent is;
But since force may be used against three persons,
In three rounds &#x27;tis divided and constructed.</p>
<p>To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we
Use force; I say on them and on their things,
As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.</p>
<p>A death by violence, and painful wounds,
Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance
Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;</p>
<p>Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,
Marauders, and freebooters, the first round
Tormenteth all in companies diverse.</p>
<p>Man may lay violent hands upon himself
And his own goods; and therefore in the second
Round must perforce without avail repent</p>
<p>Whoever of your world deprives himself,
Who games, and dissipates his property,
And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.</p>
<p>Violence can be done the Deity,
In heart denying and blaspheming Him,
And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.</p>
<p>And for this reason doth the smallest round
Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,
And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.</p>
<p>Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,
A man may practise upon him who trusts,
And him who doth no confidence imburse.</p>
<p>This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers
Only the bond of love which Nature makes;
Wherefore within the second circle nestle</p>
<p>Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,
Falsification, theft, and simony,
Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.</p>
<p>By the other mode, forgotten is that love
Which Nature makes, and what is after added,
From which there is a special faith engendered.</p>
<p>Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is
Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,
Whoe&#x27;er betrays for ever is consumed.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;My Master, clear enough proceeds
Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes
This cavern and the people who possess it.</p>
<p>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,
Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,
And who encounter with such bitter tongues,</p>
<p>Wherefore are they inside of the red city
Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,
And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?&quot;</p>
<p>And unto me he said: &quot;Why wanders so
Thine intellect from that which it is wont?
Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?</p>
<p>Hast thou no recollection of those words
With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses
The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,--</p>
<p>Incontinence, and Malice, and insane
Bestiality? and how Incontinence
Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?</p>
<p>If thou regardest this conclusion well,
And to thy mind recallest who they are
That up outside are undergoing penance,</p>
<p>Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons
They separated are, and why less wroth
Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,
Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,
That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!</p>
<p>Once more a little backward turn thee,&quot; said I,
&quot;There where thou sayest that usury offends
Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Philosophy,&quot; he said, &quot;to him who heeds it,
Noteth, not only in one place alone,
After what manner Nature takes her course</p>
<p>From Intellect Divine, and from its art;
And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,
After not many pages shalt thou find,</p>
<p>That this your art as far as possible
Follows, as the disciple doth the master;
So that your art is, as it were, God&#x27;s grandchild.</p>
<p>From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind
Genesis at the beginning, it behoves
Mankind to gain their life and to advance;</p>
<p>And since the usurer takes another way,
Nature herself and in her follower
Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.</p>
<p>But follow, now, as I would fain go on,
For quivering are the Fishes on the horizon,
And the Wain wholly over Caurus lies,</p>
<p>And far beyond there we descend the crag.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XII</p>
<p>The place where to descend the bank we came
Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,
Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.</p>
<p>Such as that ruin is which in the flank
Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,
Either by earthquake or by failing stay,</p>
<p>For from the mountain&#x27;s top, from which it moved,
Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,
Some path &#x27;twould give to him who was above;</p>
<p>Even such was the descent of that ravine,
And on the border of the broken chasm
The infamy of Crete was stretched along,</p>
<p>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;
And when he us beheld, he bit himself,
Even as one whom anger racks within.</p>
<p>My Sage towards him shouted: &quot;Peradventure
Thou think&#x27;st that here may be the Duke of Athens,
Who in the world above brought death to thee?</p>
<p>Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not
Instructed by thy sister, but he comes
In order to behold your punishments.&quot;</p>
<p>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment
In which he has received the mortal blow,
Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,</p>
<p>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;
And he, the wary, cried: &quot;Run to the passage;
While he wroth, &#x27;tis well thou shouldst descend.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus down we took our way o&#x27;er that discharge
Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves
Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.</p>
<p>Thoughtful I went; and he said: &quot;Thou art thinking
Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded
By that brute anger which just now I quenched.</p>
<p>Now will I have thee know, the other time
I here descended to the nether Hell,
This precipice had not yet fallen down.</p>
<p>But truly, if I well discern, a little
Before His coming who the mighty spoil
Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,</p>
<p>Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley
Trembled so, that I thought the Universe
Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think</p>
<p>The world ofttimes converted into chaos;
And at that moment this primeval crag
Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.</p>
<p>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near
The river of blood, within which boiling is
Whoe&#x27;er by violence doth injure others.&quot;</p>
<p>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,
That spurs us onward so in our short life,
And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</p>
<p>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,
As one which all the plain encompasses,
Conformable to what my Guide had said.</p>
<p>And between this and the embankment&#x27;s foot
Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,
As in the world they used the chase to follow.</p>
<p>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,
And from the squadron three detached themselves,
With bows and arrows in advance selected;</p>
<p>And from afar one cried: &quot;Unto what torment
Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?
Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.&quot;</p>
<p>My Master said: &quot;Our answer will we make
To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,
That will of thine was evermore so hasty.&quot;</p>
<p>Then touched he me, and said: &quot;This one is Nessus,
Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,
And for himself, himself did vengeance take.</p>
<p>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,
Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;
That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.</p>
<p>Thousands and thousands go about the moat
Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges
Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.&quot;</p>
<p>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;
Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch
Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</p>
<p>After he had uncovered his great mouth,
He said to his companions: &quot;Are you ware
That he behind moveth whate&#x27;er he touches?</p>
<p>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.&quot;
And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,
Where the two natures are together joined,</p>
<p>Replied: &quot;Indeed he lives, and thus alone
Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;
Necessity, and not delight, impels us.</p>
<p>Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja,
Who unto me committed this new office;
No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.</p>
<p>But by that virtue through which I am moving
My steps along this savage thoroughfare,
Give us some one of thine, to be with us,</p>
<p>And who may show us where to pass the ford,
And who may carry this one on his back;
For &#x27;tis no spirit that can walk the air.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,
And said to Nessus: &quot;Turn and do thou guide them,
And warn aside, if other band may meet you.&quot;</p>
<p>We with our faithful escort onward moved
Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,
Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</p>
<p>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,
And the great Centaur said: &quot;Tyrants are these,
Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</p>
<p>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here
Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius
Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</p>
<p>That forehead there which has the hair so black
Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,
Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,</p>
<p>Up in the world was by his stepson slain.&quot;
Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,
&quot;Now he be first to thee, and second I.&quot;</p>
<p>A little farther on the Centaur stopped
Above a folk, who far down as the throat
Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</p>
<p>A shade he showed us on one side alone,
Saying: &quot;He cleft asunder in God&#x27;s bosom
The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.&quot;</p>
<p>Then people saw I, who from out the river
Lifted their heads and also all the chest;
And many among these I recognised.</p>
<p>Thus ever more and more grew shallower
That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;
And there across the moat our passage was.</p>
<p>&quot;Even as thou here upon this side beholdest
The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,&quot;
The Centaur said, &quot;I wish thee to believe</p>
<p>That on this other more and more declines
Its bed, until it reunites itself
Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</p>
<p>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading
That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,
And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks</p>
<p>The tears which with the boiling it unseals
In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,
Who made upon the highways so much war.&quot;</p>
<p>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XIII</p>
<p>Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,
When we had put ourselves within a wood,
That was not marked by any path whatever.</p>
<p>Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,
Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,
Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.</p>
<p>Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,
Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold
&#x27;Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.</p>
<p>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,
Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,
With sad announcement of impending doom;</p>
<p>Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,
And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;
They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</p>
<p>And the good Master: &quot;Ere thou enter farther,
Know that thou art within the second round,&quot;
Thus he began to say, &quot;and shalt be, till</p>
<p>Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;
Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see
Things that will credence give unto my speech.&quot;</p>
<p>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,
And person none beheld I who might make them,
Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</p>
<p>I think he thought that I perhaps might think
So many voices issued through those trunks
From people who concealed themselves from us;</p>
<p>Therefore the Master said: &quot;If thou break off
Some little spray from any of these trees,
The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.&quot;</p>
<p>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,
And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;
And the trunk cried, &quot;Why dost thou mangle me?&quot;</p>
<p>After it had become embrowned with blood,
It recommenced its cry: &quot;Why dost thou rend me?
Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</p>
<p>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;
Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,
Even if the souls of serpents we had been.&quot;</p>
<p>As out of a green brand, that is on fire
At one of the ends, and from the other drips
And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</p>
<p>So from that splinter issued forth together
Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip
Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</p>
<p>&quot;Had he been able sooner to believe,&quot;
My Sage made answer, &quot;O thou wounded soul,
What only in my verses he has seen,</p>
<p>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;
Whereas the thing incredible has caused me
To put him to an act which grieveth me.</p>
<p>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way
Of some amends thy fame he may refresh
Up in the world, to which he can return.&quot;</p>
<p>And the trunk said: &quot;So thy sweet words allure me,
I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,
That I a little to discourse am tempted.</p>
<p>I am the one who both keys had in keeping
Of Frederick&#x27;s heart, and turned them to and fro
So softly in unlocking and in locking,</p>
<p>That from his secrets most men I withheld;
Fidelity I bore the glorious office
So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</p>
<p>The courtesan who never from the dwelling
Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,
Death universal and the vice of courts,</p>
<p>Inflamed against me all the other minds,
And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,
That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.</p>
<p>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,
Thinking by dying to escape disdain,
Made me unjust against myself, the just.</p>
<p>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,
Do swear to you that never broke I faith
Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;</p>
<p>And to the world if one of you return,
Let him my memory comfort, which is lying
Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.&quot;</p>
<p>Waited awhile, and then: &quot;Since he is silent,&quot;
The Poet said to me, &quot;lose not the time,
But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.&quot;</p>
<p>Whence I to him: &quot;Do thou again inquire
Concerning what thou thinks&#x27;t will satisfy me;
For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore he recommenced: &quot;So may the man
Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,
Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</p>
<p>To tell us in what way the soul is bound
Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,
If any from such members e&#x27;er is freed.&quot;</p>
<p>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward
The wind was into such a voice converted:
&quot;With brevity shall be replied to you.</p>
<p>When the exasperated soul abandons
The body whence it rent itself away,
Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</p>
<p>It falls into the forest, and no part
Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,
There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</p>
<p>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;
The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,
Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</p>
<p>Like others for our spoils shall we return;
But not that any one may them revest,
For &#x27;tis not just to have what one casts off.</p>
<p>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal
Forest our bodies shall suspended be,
Each to the thorn of his molested shade.&quot;</p>
<p>We were attentive still unto the trunk,
Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,
When by a tumult we were overtaken,</p>
<p>In the same way as he is who perceives
The boar and chase approaching to his stand,
Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</p>
<p>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,
Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,
That of the forest, every fan they broke.</p>
<p>He who was in advance: &quot;Now help, Death, help!&quot;
And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,
Was shouting: &quot;Lano, were not so alert</p>
<p>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!&quot;
And then, perchance because his breath was failing,
He grouped himself together with a bush.</p>
<p>Behind them was the forest full of black
She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot
As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</p>
<p>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,
And him they lacerated piece by piece,
Thereafter bore away those aching members.</p>
<p>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,
And led me to the bush, that all in vain
Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</p>
<p>&quot;O Jacopo,&quot; it said, &quot;of Sant&#x27; Andrea,
What helped it thee of me to make a screen?
What blame have I in thy nefarious life?&quot;</p>
<p>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,
He said: &quot;Who wast thou, that through wounds so many
Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to us: &quot;O souls, that hither come
To look upon the shameful massacre
That has so rent away from me my leaves,</p>
<p>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;
I of that city was which to the Baptist
Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</p>
<p>Forever with his art will make it sad.
And were it not that on the pass of Arno
Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</p>
<p>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it
Upon the ashes left by Attila,
In vain had caused their labour to be done.</p>
<p>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XIV</p>
<p>Because the charity of my native place
Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,
And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</p>
<p>Then came we to the confine, where disparted
The second round is from the third, and where
A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</p>
<p>Clearly to manifest these novel things,
I say that we arrived upon a plain,
Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;</p>
<p>The dolorous forest is a garland to it
All round about, as the sad moat to that;
There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</p>
<p>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,
Not of another fashion made than that
Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.</p>
<p>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou
By each one to be dreaded, who doth read
That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</p>
<p>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,
Who all were weeping very miserably,
And over them seemed set a law diverse.</p>
<p>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;
And some were sitting all drawn up together,
And others went about continually.</p>
<p>Those who were going round were far the more,
And those were less who lay down to their torment,
But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</p>
<p>O&#x27;er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,
Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,
As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</p>
<p>As Alexander, in those torrid parts
Of India, beheld upon his host
Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</p>
<p>Whence he provided with his phalanxes
To trample down the soil, because the vapour
Better extinguished was while it was single;</p>
<p>Thus was descending the eternal heat,
Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder
Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</p>
<p>Without repose forever was the dance
Of miserable hands, now there, now here,
Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</p>
<p>&quot;Master,&quot; began I, &quot;thou who overcomest
All things except the demons dire, that issued
Against us at the entrance of the gate,</p>
<p>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not
The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,
So that the rain seems not to ripen him?&quot;</p>
<p>And he himself, who had become aware
That I was questioning my Guide about him,
Cried: &quot;Such as I was living, am I, dead.</p>
<p>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom
He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,
Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</p>
<p>And if he wearied out by turns the others
In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,
Vociferating, &#x27;Help, good Vulcan, help!&#x27;</p>
<p>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,
And shot his bolts at me with all his might,
He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.&quot;</p>
<p>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,
That I had never heard him speak so loud:
&quot;O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished</p>
<p>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;
Not any torment, saving thine own rage,
Would be unto thy fury pain complete.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he turned round to me with better lip,
Saying: &quot;One of the Seven Kings was he
Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold</p>
<p>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;
But, as I said to him, his own despites
Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.</p>
<p>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place
As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,
But always keep them close unto the wood.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes
Forth from the wood a little rivulet,
Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</p>
<p>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,
The sinful women later share among them,
So downward through the sand it went its way.</p>
<p>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,
Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;
Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</p>
<p>&quot;In all the rest which I have shown to thee
Since we have entered in within the gate
Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</p>
<p>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes
So notable as is the present river,
Which all the little flames above it quenches.&quot;</p>
<p>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him
That he would give me largess of the food,
For which he had given me largess of desire.</p>
<p>&quot;In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,&quot;
Said he thereafterward, &quot;whose name is Crete,
Under whose king the world of old was chaste.</p>
<p>There is a mountain there, that once was glad
With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;
Now &#x27;tis deserted, as a thing worn out.</p>
<p>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle
Of her own son; and to conceal him better,
Whene&#x27;er he cried, she there had clamours made.</p>
<p>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,
Who holds his shoulders turned tow&#x27;rds Damietta,
And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.</p>
<p>His head is fashioned of refined gold,
And of pure silver are the arms and breast;
Then he is brass as far down as the fork.</p>
<p>From that point downward all is chosen iron,
Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,
And more he stands on that than on the other.</p>
<p>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure
Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,
Which gathered together perforate that cavern.</p>
<p>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;
Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;
Then downward go along this narrow sluice</p>
<p>Unto that point where is no more descending.
They form Cocytus; what that pool may be
Thou shalt behold, so here &#x27;tis not narrated.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;If so the present runnel
Doth take its rise in this way from our world,
Why only on this verge appears it to us?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Thou knowest the place is round,
And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,
Still to the left descending to the bottom,</p>
<p>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.
Therefore if something new appear to us,
It should not bring amazement to thy face.&quot;</p>
<p>And I again: &quot;Master, where shall be found
Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou&#x27;rt silent,
And sayest the other of this rain is made?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,&quot;
Replied he; &quot;but the boiling of the red
Water might well solve one of them thou makest.</p>
<p>Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,
There where the souls repair to lave themselves,
When sin repented of has been removed.&quot;</p>
<p>Then said he: &quot;It is time now to abandon
The wood; take heed that thou come after me;
A way the margins make that are not burning,</p>
<p>And over them all vapours are extinguished.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XV</p>
<p>Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,
And so the brooklet&#x27;s mist o&#x27;ershadows it,
From fire it saves the water and the dikes.</p>
<p>Even as the Flemings, &#x27;twixt Cadsand and Bruges,
Fearing the flood that tow&#x27;rds them hurls itself,
Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;</p>
<p>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,
To guard their villas and their villages,
Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;</p>
<p>In such similitude had those been made,
Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,
Whoever he might be, the master made them.</p>
<p>Now were we from the forest so remote,
I could not have discovered where it was,
Even if backward I had turned myself,</p>
<p>When we a company of souls encountered,
Who came beside the dike, and every one
Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont</p>
<p>To eye each other under a new moon,
And so towards us sharpened they their brows
As an old tailor at the needle&#x27;s eye.</p>
<p>Thus scrutinised by such a family,
By some one I was recognised, who seized
My garment&#x27;s hem, and cried out, &quot;What a marvel!&quot;</p>
<p>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,
On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,
That the scorched countenance prevented not</p>
<p>His recognition by my intellect;
And bowing down my face unto his own,
I made reply, &quot;Are you here, Ser Brunetto?&quot;</p>
<p>And he: &quot;May&#x27;t not displease thee, O my son,
If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini
Backward return and let the trail go on.&quot;</p>
<p>I said to him: &quot;With all my power I ask it;
And if you wish me to sit down with you,
I will, if he please, for I go with him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O son,&quot; he said, &quot;whoever of this herd
A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,
Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.</p>
<p>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,
And afterward will I rejoin my band,
Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.&quot;</p>
<p>I did not dare to go down from the road
Level to walk with him; but my head bowed
I held as one who goeth reverently.</p>
<p>And he began: &quot;What fortune or what fate
Before the last day leadeth thee down here?
And who is this that showeth thee the way?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Up there above us in the life serene,&quot;
I answered him, &quot;I lost me in a valley,
Or ever yet my age had been completed.</p>
<p>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;
This one appeared to me, returning thither,
And homeward leadeth me along this road.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;If thou thy star do follow,
Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,
If well I judged in the life beautiful.</p>
<p>And if I had not died so prematurely,
Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,
I would have given thee comfort in the work.</p>
<p>But that ungrateful and malignant people,
Which of old time from Fesole descended,
And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,</p>
<p>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;
And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs
It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;
A people avaricious, envious, proud;
Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.</p>
<p>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,
One party and the other shall be hungry
For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.</p>
<p>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole
Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,
If any still upon their dunghill rise,</p>
<p>In which may yet revive the consecrated
Seed of those Romans, who remained there when
The nest of such great malice it became.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,&quot;
Replied I to him, &quot;not yet would you be
In banishment from human nature placed;</p>
<p>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now
My heart the dear and good paternal image
Of you, when in the world from hour to hour</p>
<p>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;
And how much I am grateful, while I live
Behoves that in my language be discerned.</p>
<p>What you narrate of my career I write,
And keep it to be glossed with other text
By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.</p>
<p>This much will I have manifest to you;
Provided that my conscience do not chide me,
For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.</p>
<p>Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;
Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around
As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.&quot;</p>
<p>My Master thereupon on his right cheek
Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;
Then said: &quot;He listeneth well who noteth it.&quot;</p>
<p>Nor speaking less on that account, I go
With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are
His most known and most eminent companions.</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;To know of some is well;
Of others it were laudable to be silent,
For short would be the time for so much speech.</p>
<p>Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,
And men of letters great and of great fame,
In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.</p>
<p>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,
And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there
If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,</p>
<p>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants
From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,
Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.</p>
<p>More would I say, but coming and discoursing
Can be no longer; for that I behold
New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.</p>
<p>A people comes with whom I may not be;
Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,
In which I still live, and no more I ask.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those
Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle
Across the plain; and seemed to be among them</p>
<p>The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XVI</p>
<p>Now was I where was heard the reverberation
Of water falling into the next round,
Like to that humming which the beehives make,</p>
<p>When shadows three together started forth,
Running, from out a company that passed
Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.</p>
<p>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:
&quot;Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest
To be some one of our depraved city.&quot;</p>
<p>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,
Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!
It pains me still but to remember it.</p>
<p>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;
He turned his face towards me, and &quot;Now wait,&quot;
He said; &quot;to these we should be courteous.</p>
<p>And if it were not for the fire that darts
The nature of this region, I should say
That haste were more becoming thee than them.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced
The old refrain, and when they overtook us,
Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.</p>
<p>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,
Watching for their advantage and their hold,
Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,</p>
<p>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage
Direct to me, so that in opposite wise
His neck and feet continual journey made.</p>
<p>And, &quot;If the misery of this soft place
Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,&quot;
Began one, &quot;and our aspect black and blistered,</p>
<p>Let the renown of us thy mind incline
To tell us who thou art, who thus securely
Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.</p>
<p>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,
Naked and skinless though he now may go,
Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;</p>
<p>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;
His name was Guidoguerra, and in life
Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.</p>
<p>The other, who close by me treads the sand,
Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame
Above there in the world should welcome be.</p>
<p>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,
Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly
My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.&quot;</p>
<p>Could I have been protected from the fire,
Below I should have thrown myself among them,
And think the Teacher would have suffered it;</p>
<p>But as I should have burned and baked myself,
My terror overmastered my good will,
Which made me greedy of embracing them.</p>
<p>Then I began: &quot;Sorrow and not disdain
Did your condition fix within me so,
That tardily it wholly is stripped off,</p>
<p>As soon as this my Lord said unto me
Words, on account of which I thought within me
That people such as you are were approaching.</p>
<p>I of your city am; and evermore
Your labours and your honourable names
I with affection have retraced and heard.</p>
<p>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits
Promised to me by the veracious Leader;
But to the centre first I needs must plunge.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So may the soul for a long while conduct
Those limbs of thine,&quot; did he make answer then,
&quot;And so may thy renown shine after thee,</p>
<p>Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell
Within our city, as they used to do,
Or if they wholly have gone out of it;</p>
<p>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment
With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,
Doth greatly mortify us with his words.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,
Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,
Florence, so that thou weep&#x27;st thereat already!&quot;</p>
<p>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;
And the three, taking that for my reply,
Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</p>
<p>&quot;If other times so little it doth cost thee,&quot;
Replied they all, &quot;to satisfy another,
Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</p>
<p>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,
And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,
When it shall pleasure thee to say, &#x27;I was,&#x27;</p>
<p>See that thou speak of us unto the people.&quot;
Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight
It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</p>
<p>Not an Amen could possibly be said
So rapidly as they had disappeared;
Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.</p>
<p>I followed him, and little had we gone,
Before the sound of water was so near us,
That speaking we should hardly have been heard.</p>
<p>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course
The first from Monte Veso tow&#x27;rds the East,
Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,</p>
<p>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere
It down descendeth into its low bed,
And at Forli is vacant of that name,</p>
<p>Reverberates there above San Benedetto
From Alps, by falling at a single leap,
Where for a thousand there were room enough;</p>
<p>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,
We found resounding that dark-tinted water,
So that it soon the ear would have offended.</p>
<p>I had a cord around about me girt,
And therewithal I whilom had designed
To take the panther with the painted skin.</p>
<p>After I this had all from me unloosed,
As my Conductor had commanded me,
I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,</p>
<p>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,
And at a little distance from the verge,
He cast it down into that deep abyss.</p>
<p>&quot;It must needs be some novelty respond,&quot;
I said within myself, &quot;to the new signal
The Master with his eye is following so.&quot;</p>
<p>Ah me! how very cautious men should be
With those who not alone behold the act,
But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!</p>
<p>He said to me: &quot;Soon there will upward come
What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming
Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.&quot;</p>
<p>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,
A man should close his lips as far as may be,
Because without his fault it causes shame;</p>
<p>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes
Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,
So may they not be void of lasting favour,</p>
<p>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere
I saw a figure swimming upward come,
Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,</p>
<p>Even as he returns who goeth down
Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled
Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,</p>
<p>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XVII</p>
<p>&quot;Behold the monster with the pointed tail,
Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,
Behold him who infecteth all the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,
And beckoned him that he should come to shore,
Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</p>
<p>And that uncleanly image of deceit
Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,
But on the border did not drag its tail.</p>
<p>The face was as the face of a just man,
Its semblance outwardly was so benign,
And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</p>
<p>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;
The back, and breast, and both the sides it had
Depicted o&#x27;er with nooses and with shields.</p>
<p>With colours more, groundwork or broidery
Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,
Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.</p>
<p>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,
That part are in the water, part on land;
And as among the guzzling Germans there,</p>
<p>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;
So that vile monster lay upon the border,
Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.</p>
<p>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,
Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,
That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</p>
<p>The Guide said: &quot;Now perforce must turn aside
Our way a little, even to that beast
Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.&quot;</p>
<p>We therefore on the right side descended,
And made ten steps upon the outer verge,
Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</p>
<p>And after we are come to him, I see
A little farther off upon the sand
A people sitting near the hollow place.</p>
<p>Then said to me the Master: &quot;So that full
Experience of this round thou bear away,
Now go and see what their condition is.</p>
<p>There let thy conversation be concise;
Till thou returnest I will speak with him,
That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus farther still upon the outermost
Head of that seventh circle all alone
I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</p>
<p>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;
This way, that way, they helped them with their hands
Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</p>
<p>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,
Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when
By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</p>
<p>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces
Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,
Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</p>
<p>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,
Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;
And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.</p>
<p>And as I gazing round me come among them,
Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw
That had the face and posture of a lion.</p>
<p>Proceeding then the current of my sight,
Another of them saw I, red as blood,
Display a goose more white than butter is.</p>
<p>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid
Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,
Said unto me: &quot;What dost thou in this moat?</p>
<p>Now get thee gone; and since thou&#x27;rt still alive,
Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,
Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</p>
<p>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;
Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,
Exclaiming, &#x27;Come the sovereign cavalier,</p>
<p>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;&#x27;&quot;
Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust
His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</p>
<p>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex
Him who had warned me not to tarry long,
Backward I turned me from those weary souls.</p>
<p>I found my Guide, who had already mounted
Upon the back of that wild animal,
And said to me: &quot;Now be both strong and bold.</p>
<p>Now we descend by stairways such as these;
Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,
So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.&quot;</p>
<p>Such as he is who has so near the ague
Of quartan that his nails are blue already,
And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</p>
<p>Even such became I at those proffered words;
But shame in me his menaces produced,
Which maketh servant strong before good master.</p>
<p>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;
I wished to say, and yet the voice came not
As I believed, &quot;Take heed that thou embrace me.&quot;</p>
<p>But he, who other times had rescued me
In other peril, soon as I had mounted,
Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</p>
<p>And said: &quot;Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;
The circles large, and the descent be little;
Think of the novel burden which thou hast.&quot;</p>
<p>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,
Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;
And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</p>
<p>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,
And that extended like an eel he moved,
And with his paws drew to himself the air.</p>
<p>A greater fear I do not think there was
What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,
Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;</p>
<p>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks
Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,
His father crying, &quot;An ill way thou takest!&quot;</p>
<p>Than was my own, when I perceived myself
On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished
The sight of everything but of the monster.</p>
<p>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;
Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only
By wind upon my face and from below.</p>
<p>I heard already on the right the whirlpool
Making a horrible crashing under us;
Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</p>
<p>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;
Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,
Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</p>
<p>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,
The turning and descending, by great horrors
That were approaching upon divers sides.</p>
<p>As falcon who has long been on the wing,
Who, without seeing either lure or bird,
Maketh the falconer say, &quot;Ah me, thou stoopest,&quot;</p>
<p>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,
Thorough a hundred circles, and alights
Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</p>
<p>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,
Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,
And being disencumbered of our persons,</p>
<p>He sped away as arrow from the string.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XVIII</p>
<p>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,
Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,
As is the circle that around it turns.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the field malign
There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,
Of which its place the structure will recount.</p>
<p>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains
Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,
And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.</p>
<p>As where for the protection of the walls
Many and many moats surround the castles,
The part in which they are a figure forms,</p>
<p>Just such an image those presented there;
And as about such strongholds from their gates
Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</p>
<p>So from the precipice&#x27;s base did crags
Project, which intersected dikes and moats,
Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</p>
<p>Within this place, down shaken from the back
Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet
Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</p>
<p>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,
New torments, and new wielders of the lash,
Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</p>
<p>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;
This side the middle came they facing us,
Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</p>
<p>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,
The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,
Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</p>
<p>For all upon one side towards the Castle
Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter&#x27;s;
On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</p>
<p>This side and that, along the livid stone
Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,
Who cruelly were beating them behind.</p>
<p>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs
At the first blows! and sooth not any one
The second waited for, nor for the third.</p>
<p>While I was going on, mine eyes by one
Encountered were; and straight I said: &quot;Already
With sight of this one I am not unfed.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,
And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,
And to my going somewhat back assented;</p>
<p>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,
Lowering his face, but little it availed him;
For said I: &quot;Thou that castest down thine eyes,</p>
<p>If false are not the features which thou bearest,
Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;
But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Unwillingly I tell it;
But forces me thine utterance distinct,
Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</p>
<p>I was the one who the fair Ghisola
Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,
Howe&#x27;er the shameless story may be told.</p>
<p>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;
Nay, rather is this place so full of them,
That not so many tongues to-day are taught</p>
<p>&#x27;Twixt Reno and Savena to say &#x27;sipa;&#x27;
And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,
Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.&quot;</p>
<p>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge
A demon smote him, and said: &quot;Get thee gone
Pander, there are no women here for coin.&quot;</p>
<p>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;
Thereafterward with footsteps few we came
To where a crag projected from the bank.</p>
<p>This very easily did we ascend,
And turning to the right along its ridge,
From those eternal circles we departed.</p>
<p>When we were there, where it is hollowed out
Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,
The Guide said: &quot;Wait, and see that on thee strike</p>
<p>The vision of those others evil-born,
Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,
Because together with us they have gone.&quot;</p>
<p>From the old bridge we looked upon the train
Which tow&#x27;rds us came upon the other border,
And which the scourges in like manner smite.</p>
<p>And the good Master, without my inquiring,
Said to me: &quot;See that tall one who is coming,
And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;</p>
<p>Still what a royal aspect he retains!
That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning
The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.</p>
<p>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along
After the daring women pitiless
Had unto death devoted all their males.</p>
<p>There with his tokens and with ornate words
Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden
Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.</p>
<p>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;
Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,
And also for Medea is vengeance done.</p>
<p>With him go those who in such wise deceive;
And this sufficient be of the first valley
To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.&quot;</p>
<p>We were already where the narrow path
Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms
Of that a buttress for another arch.</p>
<p>Thence we heard people, who are making moan
In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,
And with their palms beating upon themselves</p>
<p>The margins were incrusted with a mould
By exhalation from below, that sticks there,
And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</p>
<p>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices
To give us sight of it, without ascending
The arch&#x27;s back, where most the crag impends.</p>
<p>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat
I saw a people smothered in a filth
That out of human privies seemed to flow;</p>
<p>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,
I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,
It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</p>
<p>He screamed to me: &quot;Wherefore art thou so eager
To look at me more than the other foul ones?&quot;
And I to him: &quot;Because, if I remember,</p>
<p>I have already seen thee with dry hair,
And thou&#x27;rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;
Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.&quot;</p>
<p>And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:
&quot;The flatteries have submerged me here below,
Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.&quot;</p>
<p>Then said to me the Guide: &quot;See that thou thrust
Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,
That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</p>
<p>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,
Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,
And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</p>
<p>Thais the harlot is it, who replied
Unto her paramour, when he said, &#x27;Have I
Great gratitude from thee?&#x27;--&#x27;Nay, marvellous;&#x27;</p>
<p>And herewith let our sight be satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XIX</p>
<p>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,
Ye who the things of God, which ought to be
The brides of holiness, rapaciously</p>
<p>For silver and for gold do prostitute,
Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,
Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</p>
<p>We had already on the following tomb
Ascended to that portion of the crag
Which o&#x27;er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.</p>
<p>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest
In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,
And with what justice doth thy power distribute!</p>
<p>I saw upon the sides and on the bottom
The livid stone with perforations filled,
All of one size, and every one was round.</p>
<p>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater
Than those that in my beautiful Saint John
Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,</p>
<p>And one of which, not many years ago,
I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;
Be this a seal all men to undeceive.</p>
<p>Out of the mouth of each one there protruded
The feet of a transgressor, and the legs
Up to the calf, the rest within remained.</p>
<p>In all of them the soles were both on fire;
Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,
They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.</p>
<p>Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont
To move upon the outer surface only,
So likewise was it there from heel to point.</p>
<p>&quot;Master, who is that one who writhes himself,
More than his other comrades quivering,&quot;
I said, &quot;and whom a redder flame is sucking?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;If thou wilt have me bear thee
Down there along that bank which lowest lies,
From him thou&#x27;lt know his errors and himself.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;
Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not
From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.&quot;</p>
<p>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;
We turned, and on the left-hand side descended
Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.</p>
<p>And the good Master yet from off his haunch
Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me
Of him who so lamented with his shanks.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoe&#x27;er thou art, that standest upside down,
O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,&quot;
To say began I, &quot;if thou canst, speak out.&quot;</p>
<p>I stood even as the friar who is confessing
The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,
Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</p>
<p>And he cried out: &quot;Dost thou stand there already,
Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?
By many years the record lied to me.</p>
<p>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,
For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud
The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?&quot;</p>
<p>Such I became, as people are who stand,
Not comprehending what is answered them,
As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</p>
<p>Then said Virgilius: &quot;Say to him straightway,
&#x27;I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.&#x27;&quot;
And I replied as was imposed on me.</p>
<p>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,
Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation
Said to me: &quot;Then what wantest thou of me?</p>
<p>If who I am thou carest so much to know,
That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,
Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</p>
<p>And truly was I son of the She-bear,
So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth
Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</p>
<p>Beneath my head the others are dragged down
Who have preceded me in simony,
Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</p>
<p>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever
That one shall come who I believed thou wast,
What time the sudden question I proposed.</p>
<p>But longer I my feet already toast,
And here have been in this way upside down,
Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</p>
<p>For after him shall come of fouler deed
From tow&#x27;rds the west a Pastor without law,
Such as befits to cover him and me.</p>
<p>New Jason will he be, of whom we read
In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,
So he who governs France shall be to this one.&quot;</p>
<p>I do not know if I were here too bold,
That him I answered only in this metre:
&quot;I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</p>
<p>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,
Before he put the keys into his keeping?
Truly he nothing asked but &#x27;Follow me.&#x27;</p>
<p>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias
Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen
Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</p>
<p>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,
And keep safe guard o&#x27;er the ill-gotten money,
Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.</p>
<p>And were it not that still forbids it me
The reverence for the keys superlative
Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</p>
<p>I would make use of words more grievous still;
Because your avarice afflicts the world,
Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.</p>
<p>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,
When she who sitteth upon many waters
To fornicate with kings by him was seen;</p>
<p>The same who with the seven heads was born,
And power and strength from the ten horns received,
So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.</p>
<p>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;
And from the idolater how differ ye,
Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?</p>
<p>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,
Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower
Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!&quot;</p>
<p>And while I sang to him such notes as these,
Either that anger or that conscience stung him,
He struggled violently with both his feet.</p>
<p>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,
With such contented lip he listened ever
Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</p>
<p>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,
And when he had me all upon his breast,
Remounted by the way where he descended.</p>
<p>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;
But bore me to the summit of the arch
Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</p>
<p>There tenderly he laid his burden down,
Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,
That would have been hard passage for the goats:</p>
<p>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XX</p>
<p>Of a new pain behoves me to make verses
And give material to the twentieth canto
Of the first song, which is of the submerged.</p>
<p>I was already thoroughly disposed
To peer down into the uncovered depth,
Which bathed itself with tears of agony;</p>
<p>And people saw I through the circular valley,
Silent and weeping, coming at the pace
Which in this world the Litanies assume.</p>
<p>As lower down my sight descended on them,
Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted
From chin to the beginning of the chest;</p>
<p>For tow&#x27;rds the reins the countenance was turned,
And backward it behoved them to advance,
As to look forward had been taken from them.</p>
<p>Perchance indeed by violence of palsy
Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;
But I ne&#x27;er saw it, nor believe it can be.</p>
<p>As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit
From this thy reading, think now for thyself
How I could ever keep my face unmoistened,</p>
<p>When our own image near me I beheld
Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes
Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.</p>
<p>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak
Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said
To me: &quot;Art thou, too, of the other fools?</p>
<p>Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;
Who is a greater reprobate than he
Who feels compassion at the doom divine?</p>
<p>Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom
Opened the earth before the Thebans&#x27; eyes;
Wherefore they all cried: &#x27;Whither rushest thou,</p>
<p>Amphiaraus?  Why dost leave the war?&#x27;
And downward ceased he not to fall amain
As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.</p>
<p>See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!
Because he wished to see too far before him
Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:</p>
<p>Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,
When from a male a female he became,
His members being all of them transformed;</p>
<p>And afterwards was forced to strike once more
The two entangled serpents with his rod,
Ere he could have again his manly plumes.</p>
<p>That Aruns is, who backs the other&#x27;s belly,
Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs
The Carrarese who houses underneath,</p>
<p>Among the marbles white a cavern had
For his abode; whence to behold the stars
And sea, the view was not cut off from him.</p>
<p>And she there, who is covering up her breasts,
Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,
And on that side has all the hairy skin,</p>
<p>Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,
Afterwards tarried there where I was born;
Whereof I would thou list to me a little.</p>
<p>After her father had from life departed,
And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,
She a long season wandered through the world.</p>
<p>Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake
At the Alp&#x27;s foot that shuts in Germany
Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.</p>
<p>By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,
&#x27;Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,
With water that grows stagnant in that lake.</p>
<p>Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,
And he of Brescia, and the Veronese
Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.</p>
<p>Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,
To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,
Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.</p>
<p>There of necessity must fall whatever
In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,
And grows a river down through verdant pastures.</p>
<p>Soon as the water doth begin to run,
No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,
Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.</p>
<p>Not far it runs before it finds a plain
In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,
And oft &#x27;tis wont in summer to be sickly.</p>
<p>Passing that way the virgin pitiless
Land in the middle of the fen descried,
Untilled and naked of inhabitants;</p>
<p>There to escape all human intercourse,
She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise
And lived, and left her empty body there.</p>
<p>The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,
Collected in that place, which was made strong
By the lagoon it had on every side;</p>
<p>They built their city over those dead bones,
And, after her who first the place selected,
Mantua named it, without other omen.</p>
<p>Its people once within more crowded were,
Ere the stupidity of Casalodi
From Pinamonte had received deceit.</p>
<p>Therefore I caution thee, if e&#x27;er thou hearest
Originate my city otherwise,
No falsehood may the verity defraud.&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;My Master, thy discourses are
To me so certain, and so take my faith,
That unto me the rest would be spent coals.</p>
<p>But tell me of the people who are passing,
If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,
For only unto that my mind reverts.&quot;</p>
<p>Then said he to me: &quot;He who from the cheek
Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders
Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,</p>
<p>So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,
An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,
In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.</p>
<p>Eryphylus his name was, and so sings
My lofty Tragedy in some part or other;
That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it.</p>
<p>The next, who is so slender in the flanks,
Was Michael Scott, who of a verity
Of magical illusions knew the game.</p>
<p>Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,
Who now unto his leather and his thread
Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.</p>
<p>Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,
The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;
They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.</p>
<p>But come now, for already holds the confines
Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville
Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,</p>
<p>And yesternight the moon was round already;
Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee
From time to time within the forest deep.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXI</p>
<p>From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things
Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,
We came along, and held the summit, when</p>
<p>We halted to behold another fissure
Of Malebolge and other vain laments;
And I beheld it marvellously dark.</p>
<p>As in the Arsenal of the Venetians
Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch
To smear their unsound vessels o&#x27;er again,</p>
<p>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof
One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks
The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;</p>
<p>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,
This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,
Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;</p>
<p>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,
Was boiling down below there a dense pitch
Which upon every side the bank belimed.</p>
<p>I saw it, but I did not see within it
Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,
And all swell up and resubside compressed.</p>
<p>The while below there fixedly I gazed,
My Leader, crying out: &quot;Beware, beware!&quot;
Drew me unto himself from where I stood.</p>
<p>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient
To see what it behoves him to escape,
And whom a sudden terror doth unman,</p>
<p>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;
And I beheld behind us a black devil,
Running along upon the crag, approach.</p>
<p>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!
And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,
With open wings and light upon his feet!</p>
<p>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,
A sinner did encumber with both haunches,
And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.</p>
<p>From off our bridge, he said: &quot;O Malebranche,
Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;
Plunge him beneath, for I return for others</p>
<p>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.
All there are barrators, except Bonturo;
No into Yes for money there is changed.&quot;</p>
<p>He hurled him down, and over the hard crag
Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened
In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</p>
<p>The other sank, and rose again face downward;
But the demons, under cover of the bridge,
Cried: &quot;Here the Santo Volto has no place!</p>
<p>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;
Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,
Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.&quot;</p>
<p>They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;
They said: &quot;It here behoves thee to dance covered,
That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.&quot;</p>
<p>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make
Immerse into the middle of the caldron
The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.</p>
<p>Said the good Master to me: &quot;That it be not
Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down
Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;</p>
<p>And for no outrage that is done to me
Be thou afraid, because these things I know,
For once before was I in such a scuffle.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he passed on beyond the bridge&#x27;s head,
And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,
Need was for him to have a steadfast front.</p>
<p>With the same fury, and the same uproar,
As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,
Who on a sudden begs, where&#x27;er he stops,</p>
<p>They issued from beneath the little bridge,
And turned against him all their grappling-irons;
But he cried out: &quot;Be none of you malignant!</p>
<p>Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,
Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,
And then take counsel as to grappling me.&quot;</p>
<p>They all cried out: &quot;Let Malacoda go;&quot;
Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,
And he came to him, saying: &quot;What avails it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me
Advanced into this place,&quot; my Master said,
&quot;Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,</p>
<p>Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?
Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed
That I another show this savage road.&quot;</p>
<p>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,
That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,
And to the others said: &quot;Now strike him not.&quot;</p>
<p>And unto me my Guide: &quot;O thou, who sittest
Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,
Securely now return to me again.&quot;</p>
<p>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;
And all the devils forward thrust themselves,
So that I feared they would not keep their compact.</p>
<p>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers
Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,
Seeing themselves among so many foes.</p>
<p>Close did I press myself with all my person
Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes
From off their countenance, which was not good.</p>
<p>They lowered their rakes, and &quot;Wilt thou have me hit him,&quot;
They said to one another, &quot;on the rump?&quot;
And answered: &quot;Yes; see that thou nick him with it.&quot;</p>
<p>But the same demon who was holding parley
With my Conductor turned him very quickly,
And said: &quot;Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;&quot;</p>
<p>Then said to us: &quot;You can no farther go
Forward upon this crag, because is lying
All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.</p>
<p>And if it still doth please you to go onward,
Pursue your way along upon this rock;
Near is another crag that yields a path.</p>
<p>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,
One thousand and two hundred sixty-six
Years were complete, that here the way was broken.</p>
<p>I send in that direction some of mine
To see if any one doth air himself;
Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.</p>
<p>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,&quot;
Began he to cry out, &quot;and thou, Cagnazzo;
And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.</p>
<p>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,
And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,
And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;</p>
<p>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;
Let these be safe as far as the next crag,
That all unbroken passes o&#x27;er the dens.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O me! what is it, Master, that I see?
Pray let us go,&quot; I said, &quot;without an escort,
If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.</p>
<p>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,
Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,
And with their brows are threatening woe to us?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;I will not have thee fear;
Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,
Because they do it for those boiling wretches.&quot;</p>
<p>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;
But first had each one thrust his tongue between
His teeth towards their leader for a signal;</p>
<p>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXII</p>
<p>I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,
Begin the storming, and their muster make,
And sometimes starting off for their escape;</p>
<p>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,
O Aretines, and foragers go forth,
Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,</p>
<p>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,
With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,
And with our own, and with outlandish things,</p>
<p>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth
Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,
Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</p>
<p>We went upon our way with the ten demons;
Ah, savage company! but in the church
With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!</p>
<p>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,
To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,
And of the people who therein were burned.</p>
<p>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign
To mariners by arching of the back,
That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</p>
<p>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,
One of the sinners would display his back,
And in less time conceal it than it lightens.</p>
<p>As on the brink of water in a ditch
The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,
So that they hide their feet and other bulk,</p>
<p>So upon every side the sinners stood;
But ever as Barbariccia near them came,
Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.</p>
<p>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,
One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass
One frog remains, and down another dives;</p>
<p>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,
Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,
And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</p>
<p>I knew, before, the names of all of them,
So had I noted them when they were chosen,
And when they called each other, listened how.</p>
<p>&quot;O Rubicante, see that thou do lay
Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,&quot;
Cried all together the accursed ones.</p>
<p>And I: &quot;My Master, see to it, if thou canst,
That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,
Thus come into his adversaries&#x27; hands.&quot;</p>
<p>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,
Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:
&quot;I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;</p>
<p>My mother placed me servant to a lord,
For she had borne me to a ribald knave,
Destroyer of himself and of his things.</p>
<p>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;
I set me there to practise barratry,
For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.&quot;</p>
<p>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,
On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,
Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</p>
<p>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;
But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,
And said: &quot;Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.&quot;</p>
<p>And to my Master he turned round his head;
&quot;Ask him again,&quot; he said, &quot;if more thou wish
To know from him, before some one destroy him.&quot;</p>
<p>The Guide: &quot;Now tell then of the other culprits;
Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,
Under the pitch?&quot;  And he: &quot;I separated</p>
<p>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;
Would that I still were covered up with him,
For I should fear not either claw nor hook!&quot;</p>
<p>And Libicocco: &quot;We have borne too much;&quot;
And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,
So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</p>
<p>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him
Down at the legs; whence their Decurion
Turned round and round about with evil look.</p>
<p>When they again somewhat were pacified,
Of him, who still was looking at his wound,
Demanded my Conductor without stay:</p>
<p>&quot;Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting
Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?&quot;
And he replied: &quot;It was the Friar Gomita,</p>
<p>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,
Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,
And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</p>
<p>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,
As he says; and in other offices
A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</p>
<p>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche
Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia
To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</p>
<p>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;
Still farther would I speak, but am afraid
Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.&quot;</p>
<p>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,
Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,
Said: &quot;Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you desire either to see or hear,&quot;
The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,
&quot;Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</p>
<p>But let the Malebranche cease a little,
So that these may not their revenges fear,
And I, down sitting in this very place,</p>
<p>For one that I am will make seven come,
When I shall whistle, as our custom is
To do whenever one of us comes out.&quot;</p>
<p>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,
Shaking his head, and said: &quot;Just hear the trick
Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!&quot;</p>
<p>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,
Responded: &quot;I by far too cunning am,
When I procure for mine a greater sadness.&quot;</p>
<p>Alichin held not in, but running counter
Unto the rest, said to him: &quot;If thou dive,
I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</p>
<p>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;
The height be left, and be the bank a shield
To see if thou alone dost countervail us.&quot;</p>
<p>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!
Each to the other side his eyes averted;
He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</p>
<p>The Navarrese selected well his time;
Planted his feet on land, and in a moment
Leaped, and released himself from their design.</p>
<p>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,
But he most who was cause of the defeat;
Therefore he moved, and cried: &quot;Thou art o&#x27;ertakern.&quot;</p>
<p>But little it availed, for wings could not
Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,
And, flying, upward he his breast directed;</p>
<p>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden
Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,
And upward he returneth cross and weary.</p>
<p>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina
Flying behind him followed close, desirous
The other should escape, to have a quarrel.</p>
<p>And when the barrator had disappeared,
He turned his talons upon his companion,
And grappled with him right above the moat.</p>
<p>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk
To clapperclaw him well; and both of them
Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</p>
<p>A sudden intercessor was the heat;
But ne&#x27;ertheless of rising there was naught,
To such degree they had their wings belimed.</p>
<p>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia
Made four of them fly to the other side
With all their gaffs, and very speedily</p>
<p>This side and that they to their posts descended;
They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,
Who were already baked within the crust,</p>
<p>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXIII</p>
<p>Silent, alone, and without company
We went, the one in front, the other after,
As go the Minor Friars along their way.</p>
<p>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed
My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,
Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;</p>
<p>For &#x27;mo&#x27; and &#x27;issa&#x27; are not more alike
Than this one is to that, if well we couple
End and beginning with a steadfast mind.</p>
<p>And even as one thought from another springs,
So afterward from that was born another,
Which the first fear within me double made.</p>
<p>Thus did I ponder: &quot;These on our account
Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff
So great, that much I think it must annoy them.</p>
<p>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,
They will come after us more merciless
Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,&quot;</p>
<p>I felt my hair stand all on end already
With terror, and stood backwardly intent,
When said I: &quot;Master, if thou hidest not</p>
<p>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche
I am in dread; we have them now behind us;
I so imagine them, I already feel them.&quot;</p>
<p>And he: &quot;If I were made of leaded glass,
Thine outward image I should not attract
Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.</p>
<p>Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,
With similar attitude and similar face,
So that of both one counsel sole I made.</p>
<p>If peradventure the right bank so slope
That we to the next Bolgia can descend,
We shall escape from the imagined chase.&quot;</p>
<p>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,
When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,
Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.</p>
<p>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,
Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,
And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,</p>
<p>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,
Having more care of him than of herself,
So that she clothes her only with a shift;</p>
<p>And downward from the top of the hard bank
Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,
That one side of the other Bolgia walls.</p>
<p>Ne&#x27;er ran so swiftly water through a sluice
To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,
When nearest to the paddles it approaches,</p>
<p>As did my Master down along that border,
Bearing me with him on his breast away,
As his own son, and not as a companion.</p>
<p>Hardly the bed of the ravine below
His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill
Right over us; but he was not afraid;</p>
<p>For the high Providence, which had ordained
To place them ministers of the fifth moat,
The power of thence departing took from all.</p>
<p>A painted people there below we found,
Who went about with footsteps very slow,
Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.</p>
<p>They had on mantles with the hoods low down
Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut
That in Cologne they for the monks are made.</p>
<p>Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;
But inwardly all leaden and so heavy
That Frederick used to put them on of straw.</p>
<p>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!
Again we turned us, still to the left hand
Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;</p>
<p>But owing to the weight, that weary folk
Came on so tardily, that we were new
In company at each motion of the haunch.</p>
<p>Whence I unto my Leader: &quot;See thou find
Some one who may by deed or name be known,
And thus in going move thine eye about.&quot;</p>
<p>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,
Cried to us from behind: &quot;Stay ye your feet,
Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!</p>
<p>Perhaps thou&#x27;lt have from me what thou demandest.&quot;
Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: &quot;Wait,
And then according to his pace proceed.&quot;</p>
<p>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste
Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;
But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.</p>
<p>When they came up, long with an eye askance
They scanned me without uttering a word.
Then to each other turned, and said together:</p>
<p>&quot;He by the action of his throat seems living;
And if they dead are, by what privilege
Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?&quot;</p>
<p>Then said to me: &quot;Tuscan, who to the college
Of miserable hypocrites art come,
Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to them: &quot;Born was I, and grew up
In the great town on the fair river of Arno,
And with the body am I&#x27;ve always had.</p>
<p>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down
Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?
And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?&quot;</p>
<p>And one replied to me: &quot;These orange cloaks
Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights
Cause in this way their balances to creak.</p>
<p>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;
I Catalano, and he Loderingo
Named, and together taken by thy city,</p>
<p>As the wont is to take one man alone,
For maintenance of its peace; and we were such
That still it is apparent round Gardingo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O Friars,&quot; began I, &quot;your iniquitous. . .&quot;
But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed
One crucified with three stakes on the ground.</p>
<p>When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,
Blowing into his beard with suspirations;
And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,</p>
<p>Said to me: &quot;This transfixed one, whom thou seest,
Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet
To put one man to torture for the people.</p>
<p>Crosswise and naked is he on the path,
As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,
Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;</p>
<p>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished
Within this moat, and the others of the council,
Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.&quot;</p>
<p>And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel
O&#x27;er him who was extended on the cross
So vilely in eternal banishment.</p>
<p>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:
&quot;Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us
If to the right hand any pass slope down</p>
<p>By which we two may issue forth from here,
Without constraining some of the black angels
To come and extricate us from this deep.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he made answer: &quot;Nearer than thou hopest
There is a rock, that forth from the great circle
Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,</p>
<p>Save that at this &#x27;tis broken, and does not bridge it;
You will be able to mount up the ruin,
That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.&quot;</p>
<p>The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;
Then said: &quot;The business badly he recounted
Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.&quot;</p>
<p>And the Friar: &quot;Many of the Devil&#x27;s vices
Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,
That he&#x27;s a liar and the father of lies.&quot;</p>
<p>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,
Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;
Whence from the heavy-laden I departed</p>
<p>After the prints of his beloved feet.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXIV</p>
<p>In that part of the youthful year wherein
The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,
And now the nights draw near to half the day,</p>
<p>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground
The outward semblance of her sister white,
But little lasts the temper of her pen,</p>
<p>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,
Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign
All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</p>
<p>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,
Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;
Then he returns and hope revives again,</p>
<p>Seeing the world has changed its countenance
In little time, and takes his shepherd&#x27;s crook,
And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</p>
<p>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,
When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,
And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</p>
<p>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,
The Leader turned to me with that sweet look
Which at the mountain&#x27;s foot I first beheld.</p>
<p>His arms he opened, after some advisement
Within himself elected, looking first
Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</p>
<p>And even as he who acts and meditates,
For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,
So upward lifting me towards the summit</p>
<p>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,
Saying: &quot;To that one grapple afterwards,
But try first if &#x27;tis such that it will hold thee.&quot;</p>
<p>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;
For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,
Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</p>
<p>And had it not been, that upon that precinct
Shorter was the ascent than on the other,
He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</p>
<p>But because Malebolge tow&#x27;rds the mouth
Of the profoundest well is all inclining,
The structure of each valley doth import</p>
<p>That one bank rises and the other sinks.
Still we arrived at length upon the point
Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</p>
<p>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,
When I was up, that I could go no farther,
Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</p>
<p>&quot;Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,&quot;
My Master said; &quot;for sitting upon down,
Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,</p>
<p>Withouten which whoso his life consumes
Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,
As smoke in air or in the water foam.</p>
<p>And therefore raise thee up, o&#x27;ercome the anguish
With spirit that o&#x27;ercometh every battle,
If with its heavy body it sink not.</p>
<p>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;
&#x27;Tis not enough from these to have departed;
Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.&quot;</p>
<p>Then I uprose, showing myself provided
Better with breath than I did feel myself,
And said: &quot;Go on, for I am strong and bold.&quot;</p>
<p>Upward we took our way along the crag,
Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,
And more precipitous far than that before.</p>
<p>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;
Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,
Not well adapted to articulate words.</p>
<p>I know not what it said, though o&#x27;er the back
I now was of the arch that passes there;
But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</p>
<p>I was bent downward, but my living eyes
Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;
Wherefore I: &quot;Master, see that thou arrive</p>
<p>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;
For as from hence I hear and understand not,
So I look down and nothing I distinguish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Other response,&quot; he said, &quot;I make thee not,
Except the doing; for the modest asking
Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.&quot;</p>
<p>We from the bridge descended at its head,
Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,
And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</p>
<p>And I beheld therein a terrible throng
Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,
That the remembrance still congeals my blood</p>
<p>Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;
For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae
She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</p>
<p>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant
E&#x27;er showed she with all Ethiopia,
Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</p>
<p>Among this cruel and most dismal throng
People were running naked and affrighted.
Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.</p>
<p>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;
These riveted upon their reins the tail
And head, and were in front of them entwined.</p>
<p>And lo! at one who was upon our side
There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him
There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</p>
<p>Nor &#x27;O&#x27; so quickly e&#x27;er, nor &#x27;I&#x27; was written,
As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly
Behoved it that in falling he became.</p>
<p>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,
The ashes drew together, and of themselves
Into himself they instantly returned.</p>
<p>Even thus by the great sages &#x27;tis confessed
The phoenix dies, and then is born again,
When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</p>
<p>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
But only on tears of incense and amomum,
And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</p>
<p>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,
By force of demons who to earth down drag him,
Or other oppilation that binds man,</p>
<p>When he arises and around him looks,
Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish
Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</p>
<p>Such was that sinner after he had risen.
Justice of God! O how severe it is,
That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</p>
<p>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;
Whence he replied: &quot;I rained from Tuscany
A short time since into this cruel gorge.</p>
<p>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,
Even as the mule I was; I&#x27;m Vanni Fucci,
Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.&quot;</p>
<p>And I unto the Guide: &quot;Tell him to stir not,
And ask what crime has thrust him here below,
For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.&quot;</p>
<p>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,
But unto me directed mind and face,
And with a melancholy shame was painted.</p>
<p>Then said: &quot;It pains me more that thou hast caught me
Amid this misery where thou seest me,
Than when I from the other life was taken.</p>
<p>What thou demandest I cannot deny;
So low am I put down because I robbed
The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</p>
<p>And falsely once &#x27;twas laid upon another;
But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,
If thou shalt e&#x27;er be out of the dark places,</p>
<p>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:
Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;
Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</p>
<p>Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,
Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,
And with impetuous and bitter tempest</p>
<p>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;
When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,
So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</p>
<p>And this I&#x27;ve said that it may give thee pain.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXV</p>
<p>At the conclusion of his words, the thief
Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,
Crying: &quot;Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.&quot;</p>
<p>From that time forth the serpents were my friends;
For one entwined itself about his neck
As if it said: &quot;I will not thou speak more;&quot;</p>
<p>And round his arms another, and rebound him,
Clinching itself together so in front,
That with them he could not a motion make.</p>
<p>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not
To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,
Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?</p>
<p>Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,
Spirit I saw not against God so proud,
Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!</p>
<p>He fled away, and spake no further word;
And I beheld a Centaur full of rage
Come crying out: &quot;Where is, where is the scoffer?&quot;</p>
<p>I do not think Maremma has so many
Serpents as he had all along his back,
As far as where our countenance begins.</p>
<p>Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,
With wings wide open was a dragon lying,
And he sets fire to all that he encounters.</p>
<p>My Master said: &quot;That one is Cacus, who
Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine
Created oftentimes a lake of blood.</p>
<p>He goes not on the same road with his brothers,
By reason of the fraudulent theft he made
Of the great herd, which he had near to him;</p>
<p>Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath
The mace of Hercules, who peradventure
Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.&quot;</p>
<p>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,
And spirits three had underneath us come,
Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,</p>
<p>Until what time they shouted: &quot;Who are you?&quot;
On which account our story made a halt,
And then we were intent on them alone.</p>
<p>I did not know them; but it came to pass,
As it is wont to happen by some chance,
That one to name the other was compelled,</p>
<p>Exclaiming: &quot;Where can Cianfa have remained?&quot;
Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,
Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.</p>
<p>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe
What I shall say, it will no marvel be,
For I who saw it hardly can admit it.</p>
<p>As I was holding raised on them my brows,
Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth
In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.</p>
<p>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,
And with the forward ones his arms it seized;
Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;</p>
<p>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,
And put its tail through in between the two,
And up behind along the reins outspread it.</p>
<p>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs
Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile
Upon the other&#x27;s limbs entwined its own.</p>
<p>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax
They had been made, and intermixed their colour;
Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;</p>
<p>E&#x27;en as proceedeth on before the flame
Upward along the paper a brown colour,
Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.</p>
<p>The other two looked on, and each of them
Cried out: &quot;O me, Agnello, how thou changest!
Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.&quot;</p>
<p>Already the two heads had one become,
When there appeared to us two figures mingled
Into one face, wherein the two were lost.</p>
<p>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,
The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest
Members became that never yet were seen.</p>
<p>Every original aspect there was cancelled;
Two and yet none did the perverted image
Appear, and such departed with slow pace.</p>
<p>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge
Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,
Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;</p>
<p>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies
Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,
Livid and black as is a peppercorn.</p>
<p>And in that part whereat is first received
Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;
Then downward fell in front of him extended.</p>
<p>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;
Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,
Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.</p>
<p>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;
One through the wound, the other through the mouth
Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.</p>
<p>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions
Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,
And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.</p>
<p>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;
For if him to a snake, her to fountain,
Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;</p>
<p>Because two natures never front to front
Has he transmuted, so that both the forms
To interchange their matter ready were.</p>
<p>Together they responded in such wise,
That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,
And eke the wounded drew his feet together.</p>
<p>The legs together with the thighs themselves
Adhered so, that in little time the juncture
No sign whatever made that was apparent.</p>
<p>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure
The other one was losing, and his skin
Became elastic, and the other&#x27;s hard.</p>
<p>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,
And both feet of the reptile, that were short,
Lengthen as much as those contracted were.</p>
<p>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,
Became the member that a man conceals,
And of his own the wretch had two created.</p>
<p>While both of them the exhalation veils
With a new colour, and engenders hair
On one of them and depilates the other,</p>
<p>The one uprose and down the other fell,
Though turning not away their impious lamps,
Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.</p>
<p>He who was standing drew it tow&#x27;rds the temples,
And from excess of matter, which came thither,
Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;</p>
<p>What did not backward run and was retained
Of that excess made to the face a nose,
And the lips thickened far as was befitting.</p>
<p>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,
And backward draws the ears into his head,
In the same manner as the snail its horns;</p>
<p>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt
For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked
In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.</p>
<p>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,
Along the valley hissing takes to flight,
And after him the other speaking sputters.</p>
<p>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,
And said to the other: &quot;I&#x27;ll have Buoso run,
Crawling as I have done, along this road.&quot;</p>
<p>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast
Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse
The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.</p>
<p>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be
Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,
They could not flee away so secretly</p>
<p>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;
And he it was who sole of three companions,
Which came in the beginning, was not changed;</p>
<p>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXVI</p>
<p>Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,
That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,
And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!</p>
<p>Among the thieves five citizens of thine
Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,
And thou thereby to no great honour risest.</p>
<p>But if when morn is near our dreams are true,
Feel shalt thou in a little time from now
What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.</p>
<p>And if it now were, it were not too soon;
Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,
For &#x27;twill aggrieve me more the more I age.</p>
<p>We went our way, and up along the stairs
The bourns had made us to descend before,
Remounted my Conductor and drew me.</p>
<p>And following the solitary path
Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,
The foot without the hand sped not at all.</p>
<p>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,
When I direct my mind to what I saw,
And more my genius curb than I am wont,</p>
<p>That it may run not unless virtue guide it;
So that if some good star, or better thing,
Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.</p>
<p>As many as the hind (who on the hill
Rests at the time when he who lights the world
His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</p>
<p>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)
Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,
Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</p>
<p>With flames as manifold resplendent all
Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware
As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</p>
<p>And such as he who with the bears avenged him
Beheld Elijah&#x27;s chariot at departing,
What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</p>
<p>For with his eye he could not follow it
So as to see aught else than flame alone,
Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</p>
<p>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment
Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,
And every flame a sinner steals away.</p>
<p>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,
So that, if I had seized not on a rock,
Down had I fallen without being pushed.</p>
<p>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,
Exclaimed: &quot;Within the fires the spirits are;
Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Master,&quot; I replied, &quot;by hearing thee
I am more sure; but I surmised already
It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</p>
<p>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft
At top, it seems uprising from the pyre
Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.&quot;</p>
<p>He answered me: &quot;Within there are tormented
Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together
They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.</p>
<p>And there within their flame do they lament
The ambush of the horse, which made the door
Whence issued forth the Romans&#x27; gentle seed;</p>
<p>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead
Deidamia still deplores Achilles,
And pain for the Palladium there is borne.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If they within those sparks possess the power
To speak,&quot; I said, &quot;thee, Master, much I pray,
And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</p>
<p>That thou make no denial of awaiting
Until the horned flame shall hither come;
Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Worthy is thy entreaty
Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;
But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.</p>
<p>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived
That which thou wishest; for they might disdain
Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.&quot;</p>
<p>When now the flame had come unto that point,
Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,
After this fashion did I hear him speak:</p>
<p>&quot;O ye, who are twofold within one fire,
If I deserved of you, while I was living,
If I deserved of you or much or little</p>
<p>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,
Do not move on, but one of you declare
Whither, being lost, he went away to die.&quot;</p>
<p>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,
Murmuring, began to wave itself about
Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</p>
<p>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro
Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,
It uttered forth a voice, and said: &quot;When I</p>
<p>From Circe had departed, who concealed me
More than a year there near unto Gaeta,
Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</p>
<p>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence
For my old father, nor the due affection
Which joyous should have made Penelope,</p>
<p>Could overcome within me the desire
I had to be experienced of the world,
And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</p>
<p>But I put forth on the high open sea
With one sole ship, and that small company
By which I never had deserted been.</p>
<p>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,
Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,
And the others which that sea bathes round about.</p>
<p>I and my company were old and slow
When at that narrow passage we arrived
Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,</p>
<p>That man no farther onward should adventure.
On the right hand behind me left I Seville,
And on the other already had left Ceuta.</p>
<p>&#x27;O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand
Perils,&#x27; I said, &#x27;have come unto the West,
To this so inconsiderable vigil</p>
<p>Which is remaining of your senses still
Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,
Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</p>
<p>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;
Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,
But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.&#x27;</p>
<p>So eager did I render my companions,
With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,
That then I hardly could have held them back.</p>
<p>And having turned our stern unto the morning,
We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,
Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</p>
<p>Already all the stars of the other pole
The night beheld, and ours so very low
It did not rise above the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Five times rekindled and as many quenched
Had been the splendour underneath the moon,
Since we had entered into the deep pass,</p>
<p>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim
From distance, and it seemed to me so high
As I had never any one beheld.</p>
<p>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;
For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,
And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</p>
<p>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,
At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,
And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</p>
<p>Until the sea above us closed again.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXVII</p>
<p>Already was the flame erect and quiet,
To speak no more, and now departed from us
With the permission of the gentle Poet;</p>
<p>When yet another, which behind it came,
Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top
By a confused sound that issued from it.</p>
<p>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first
With the lament of him, and that was right,
Who with his file had modulated it)</p>
<p>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,
That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,
Still it appeared with agony transfixed;</p>
<p>Thus, by not having any way or issue
At first from out the fire, to its own language
Converted were the melancholy words.</p>
<p>But afterwards, when they had gathered way
Up through the point, giving it that vibration
The tongue had given them in their passage out,</p>
<p>We heard it said: &quot;O thou, at whom I aim
My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard,
Saying, &#x27;Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,&#x27;</p>
<p>Because I come perchance a little late,
To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee;
Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.</p>
<p>If thou but lately into this blind world
Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land,
Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression,</p>
<p>Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war,
For I was from the mountains there between
Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.&quot;</p>
<p>I still was downward bent and listening,
When my Conductor touched me on the side,
Saying: &quot;Speak thou: this one a Latian is.&quot;</p>
<p>And I, who had beforehand my reply
In readiness, forthwith began to speak:
&quot;O soul, that down below there art concealed,</p>
<p>Romagna thine is not and never has been
Without war in the bosom of its tyrants;
But open war I none have left there now.</p>
<p>Ravenna stands as it long years has stood;
The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding,
So that she covers Cervia with her vans.</p>
<p>The city which once made the long resistance,
And of the French a sanguinary heap,
Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again;</p>
<p>Verrucchio&#x27;s ancient Mastiff and the new,
Who made such bad disposal of Montagna,
Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth.</p>
<p>The cities of Lamone and Santerno
Governs the Lioncel of the white lair,
Who changes sides &#x27;twixt summer-time and winter;</p>
<p>And that of which the Savio bathes the flank,
Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,
Lives between tyranny and a free state.</p>
<p>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;
Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,
So may thy name hold front there in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>After the fire a little more had roared
In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved
This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</p>
<p>&quot;If I believed that my reply were made
To one who to the world would e&#x27;er return,
This flame without more flickering would stand still;</p>
<p>But inasmuch as never from this depth
Did any one return, if I hear true,
Without the fear of infamy I answer,</p>
<p>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,
Believing thus begirt to make amends;
And truly my belief had been fulfilled</p>
<p>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,
Who put me back into my former sins;
And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.</p>
<p>While I was still the form of bone and pulp
My mother gave to me, the deeds I did
Were not those of a lion, but a fox.</p>
<p>The machinations and the covert ways
I knew them all, and practised so their craft,
That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</p>
<p>When now unto that portion of mine age
I saw myself arrived, when each one ought
To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,</p>
<p>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;
And penitent and confessing I surrendered,
Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</p>
<p>The Leader of the modern Pharisees
Having a war near unto Lateran,
And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</p>
<p>For each one of his enemies was Christian,
And none of them had been to conquer Acre,
Nor merchandising in the Sultan&#x27;s land,</p>
<p>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,
In him regarded, nor in me that cord
Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</p>
<p>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester
To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,
So this one sought me out as an adept</p>
<p>To cure him of the fever of his pride.
Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,
Because his words appeared inebriate.</p>
<p>And then he said: &#x27;Be not thy heart afraid;
Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me
How to raze Palestrina to the ground.</p>
<p>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,
As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,
The which my predecessor held not dear.&#x27;</p>
<p>Then urged me on his weighty arguments
There, where my silence was the worst advice;
And said I: &#x27;Father, since thou washest me</p>
<p>Of that sin into which I now must fall,
The promise long with the fulfilment short
Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.&#x27;</p>
<p>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,
For me; but one of the black Cherubim
Said to him: &#x27;Take him not; do me no wrong;</p>
<p>He must come down among my servitors,
Because he gave the fraudulent advice
From which time forth I have been at his hair;</p>
<p>For who repents not cannot be absolved,
Nor can one both repent and will at once,
Because of the contradiction which consents not.&#x27;</p>
<p>O miserable me! how I did shudder
When he seized on me, saying: &#x27;Peradventure
Thou didst not think that I was a logician!&#x27;</p>
<p>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined
Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,
And after he had bitten it in great rage,</p>
<p>Said: &#x27;Of the thievish fire a culprit this;&#x27;
Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,
And vested thus in going I bemoan me.&quot;</p>
<p>When it had thus completed its recital,
The flame departed uttering lamentations,
Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</p>
<p>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,
Up o&#x27;er the crag above another arch,
Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee</p>
<p>By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXVIII</p>
<p>Who ever could, e&#x27;en with untrammelled words,
Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full
Which now I saw, by many times narrating?</p>
<p>Each tongue would for a certainty fall short
By reason of our speech and memory,
That have small room to comprehend so much.</p>
<p>If were again assembled all the people
Which formerly upon the fateful land
Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood</p>
<p>Shed by the Romans and the lingering war
That of the rings made such illustrious spoils,
As Livy has recorded, who errs not,</p>
<p>With those who felt the agony of blows
By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard,
And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still</p>
<p>At Ceperano, where a renegade
Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo,
Where without arms the old Alardo conquered,</p>
<p>And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,
Should show, it would be nothing to compare
With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.</p>
<p>A cask by losing centre-piece or cant
Was never shattered so, as I saw one
Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.</p>
<p>Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;
His heart was visible, and the dismal sack
That maketh excrement of what is eaten.</p>
<p>While I was all absorbed in seeing him,
He looked at me, and opened with his hands
His bosom, saying: &quot;See now how I rend me;</p>
<p>How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;
In front of me doth Ali weeping go,
Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;</p>
<p>And all the others whom thou here beholdest,
Disseminators of scandal and of schism
While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.</p>
<p>A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us
Thus cruelly, unto the falchion&#x27;s edge
Putting again each one of all this ream,</p>
<p>When we have gone around the doleful road;
By reason that our wounds are closed again
Ere any one in front of him repass.</p>
<p>But who art thou, that musest on the crag,
Perchance to postpone going to the pain
That is adjudged upon thine accusations?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,&quot;
My Master made reply, &quot;to be tormented;
But to procure him full experience,</p>
<p>Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him
Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;
And this is true as that I speak to thee.&quot;</p>
<p>More than a hundred were there when they heard him,
Who in the moat stood still to look at me,
Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.</p>
<p>&quot;Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,
Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,
If soon he wish not here to follow me,</p>
<p>So with provisions, that no stress of snow
May give the victory to the Novarese,
Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.&quot;</p>
<p>After one foot to go away he lifted,
This word did Mahomet say unto me,
Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.</p>
<p>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,
And nose cut off close underneath the brows,
And had no longer but a single ear,</p>
<p>Staying to look in wonder with the others,
Before the others did his gullet open,
Which outwardly was red in every part,</p>
<p>And said: &quot;O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,
And whom I once saw up in Latian land,
Unless too great similitude deceive me,</p>
<p>Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,
If e&#x27;er thou see again the lovely plain
That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,</p>
<p>And make it known to the best two of Fano,
To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,
That if foreseeing here be not in vain,</p>
<p>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,
And drowned near unto the Cattolica,
By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.</p>
<p>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca
Neptune ne&#x27;er yet beheld so great a crime,
Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.</p>
<p>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,
And holds the land, which some one here with me
Would fain be fasting from the vision of,</p>
<p>Will make them come unto a parley with him;
Then will do so, that to Focara&#x27;s wind
They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;Show to me and declare,
If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,
Who is this person of the bitter vision.&quot;</p>
<p>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw
Of one of his companions, and his mouth
Oped, crying: &quot;This is he, and he speaks not.</p>
<p>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged
In Caesar by affirming the forearmed
Always with detriment allowed delay.&quot;</p>
<p>O how bewildered unto me appeared,
With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,
Curio, who in speaking was so bold!</p>
<p>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,
The stumps uplifting through the murky air,
So that the blood made horrible his face,</p>
<p>Cried out: &quot;Thou shalt remember Mosca also,
Who said, alas! &#x27;A thing done has an end!&#x27;
Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And death unto thy race,&quot; thereto I added;
Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,
Departed, like a person sad and crazed.</p>
<p>But I remained to look upon the crowd;
And saw a thing which I should be afraid,
Without some further proof, even to recount,</p>
<p>If it were not that conscience reassures me,
That good companion which emboldens man
Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.</p>
<p>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,
A trunk without a head walk in like manner
As walked the others of the mournful herd.</p>
<p>And by the hair it held the head dissevered,
Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,
And that upon us gazed and said: &quot;O me!&quot;</p>
<p>It of itself made to itself a lamp,
And they were two in one, and one in two;
How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.</p>
<p>When it was come close to the bridge&#x27;s foot,
It lifted high its arm with all the head,
To bring more closely unto us its words,</p>
<p>Which were: &quot;Behold now the sore penalty,
Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;
Behold if any be as great as this.</p>
<p>And so that thou may carry news of me,
Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same
Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.</p>
<p>I made the father and the son rebellious;
Achitophel not more with Absalom
And David did with his accursed goadings.</p>
<p>Because I parted persons so united,
Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!
From its beginning, which is in this trunk.</p>
<p>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXIX</p>
<p>The many people and the divers wounds
These eyes of mine had so inebriated,
That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</p>
<p>But said Virgilius: &quot;What dost thou still gaze at?
Why is thy sight still riveted down there
Among the mournful, mutilated shades?</p>
<p>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;
Consider, if to count them thou believest,
That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,</p>
<p>And now the moon is underneath our feet;
Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,
And more is to be seen than what thou seest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If thou hadst,&quot; I made answer thereupon,
&quot;Attended to the cause for which I looked,
Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him
I went, already making my reply,
And superadding: &quot;In that cavern where</p>
<p>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,
I think a spirit of my blood laments
The sin which down below there costs so much.&quot;</p>
<p>Then said the Master: &quot;Be no longer broken
Thy thought from this time forward upon him;
Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;</p>
<p>For him I saw below the little bridge,
Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger
Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.</p>
<p>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded
By him who formerly held Altaforte,
Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O my Conductor, his own violent death,
Which is not yet avenged for him,&quot; I said,
&quot;By any who is sharer in the shame,</p>
<p>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,
As I imagine, without speaking to me,
And thereby made me pity him the more.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus did we speak as far as the first place
Upon the crag, which the next valley shows
Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</p>
<p>When we were now right over the last cloister
Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers
Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</p>
<p>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,
Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,
Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</p>
<p>What pain would be, if from the hospitals
Of Valdichiana, &#x27;twixt July and September,
And of Maremma and Sardinia</p>
<p>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,
Such was it here, and such a stench came from it
As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</p>
<p>We had descended on the furthest bank
From the long crag, upon the left hand still,
And then more vivid was my power of sight</p>
<p>Down tow&#x27;rds the bottom, where the ministress
Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,
Punishes forgers, which she here records.</p>
<p>I do not think a sadder sight to see
Was in Aegina the whole people sick,
(When was the air so full of pestilence,</p>
<p>The animals, down to the little worm,
All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,
According as the poets have affirmed,</p>
<p>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)
Than was it to behold through that dark valley
The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</p>
<p>This on the belly, that upon the back
One of the other lay, and others crawling
Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</p>
<p>We step by step went onward without speech,
Gazing upon and listening to the sick
Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</p>
<p>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,
As leans in heating platter against platter,
From head to foot bespotted o&#x27;er with scabs;</p>
<p>And never saw I plied a currycomb
By stable-boy for whom his master waits,
Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</p>
<p>As every one was plying fast the bite
Of nails upon himself, for the great rage
Of itching which no other succour had.</p>
<p>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,
In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,
Or any other fish that has them largest.</p>
<p>&quot;O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,&quot;
Began my Leader unto one of them,
&quot;And makest of them pincers now and then,</p>
<p>Tell me if any Latian is with those
Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee
To all eternity unto this work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,
Both of us here,&quot; one weeping made reply;
&quot;But who art thou, that questionest about us?&quot;</p>
<p>And said the Guide: &quot;One am I who descends
Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,
And I intend to show Hell unto him.&quot;</p>
<p>Then broken was their mutual support,
And trembling each one turned himself to me,
With others who had heard him by rebound.</p>
<p>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,
Saying: &quot;Say unto them whate&#x27;er thou wishest.&quot;
And I began, since he would have it so:</p>
<p>&quot;So may your memory not steal away
In the first world from out the minds of men,
But so may it survive &#x27;neath many suns,</p>
<p>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;
Let not your foul and loathsome punishment
Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I of Arezzo was,&quot; one made reply,
&quot;And Albert of Siena had me burned;
But what I died for does not bring me here.</p>
<p>&#x27;Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,
That I could rise by flight into the air,
And he who had conceit, but little wit,</p>
<p>Would have me show to him the art; and only
Because no Daedalus I made him, made me
Be burned by one who held him as his son.</p>
<p>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,
For alchemy, which in the world I practised,
Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.&quot;</p>
<p>And to the Poet said I: &quot;Now was ever
So vain a people as the Sienese?
Not for a certainty the French by far.&quot;</p>
<p>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,
Replied unto my speech: &quot;Taking out Stricca,
Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</p>
<p>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use
Of cloves discovered earliest of all
Within that garden where such seed takes root;</p>
<p>And taking out the band, among whom squandered
Caccia d&#x27;Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,
And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</p>
<p>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee
Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye
Tow&#x27;rds me, so that my face well answer thee,</p>
<p>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio&#x27;s shade,
Who metals falsified by alchemy;
Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</p>
<p>How I a skilful ape of nature was.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXX</p>
<p>&#x27;Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,
For Semele, against the Theban blood,
As she already more than once had shown,</p>
<p>So reft of reason Athamas became,
That, seeing his own wife with children twain
Walking encumbered upon either hand,</p>
<p>He cried: &quot;Spread out the nets, that I may take
The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;&quot;
And then extended his unpitying claws,</p>
<p>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,
And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;
And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;--</p>
<p>And at the time when fortune downward hurled
The Trojan&#x27;s arrogance, that all things dared,
So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,</p>
<p>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,
When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,
And of her Polydorus on the shore</p>
<p>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,
Out of her senses like a dog she barked,
So much the anguish had her mind distorted;</p>
<p>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan
Were ever seen in any one so cruel
In goading beasts, and much more human members,</p>
<p>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,
Who, biting, in the manner ran along
That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.</p>
<p>One to Capocchio came, and by the nape
Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging
It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</p>
<p>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,
Said to me: &quot;That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,
And raving goes thus harrying other people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O,&quot; said I to him, &quot;so may not the other
Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee
To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;That is the ancient ghost
Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became
Beyond all rightful love her father&#x27;s lover.</p>
<p>She came to sin with him after this manner,
By counterfeiting of another&#x27;s form;
As he who goeth yonder undertook,</p>
<p>That he might gain the lady of the herd,
To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,
Making a will and giving it due form.&quot;</p>
<p>And after the two maniacs had passed
On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back
To look upon the other evil-born.</p>
<p>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,
If he had only had the groin cut off
Just at the point at which a man is forked.</p>
<p>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions
The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,
That the face corresponds not to the belly,</p>
<p>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart
As does the hectic, who because of thirst
One tow&#x27;rds the chin, the other upward turns.</p>
<p>&quot;O ye, who without any torment are,
And why I know not, in the world of woe,&quot;
He said to us, &quot;behold, and be attentive</p>
<p>Unto the misery of Master Adam;
I had while living much of what I wished,
And now, alas! a drop of water crave.</p>
<p>The rivulets, that from the verdant hills
Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,
Making their channels to be cold and moist,</p>
<p>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;
For far more doth their image dry me up
Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</p>
<p>The rigid justice that chastises me
Draweth occasion from the place in which
I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</p>
<p>There is Romena, where I counterfeited
The currency imprinted with the Baptist,
For which I left my body burned above.</p>
<p>But if I here could see the tristful soul
Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,
For Branda&#x27;s fount I would not give the sight.</p>
<p>One is within already, if the raving
Shades that are going round about speak truth;
But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</p>
<p>If I were only still so light, that in
A hundred years I could advance one inch,
I had already started on the way,</p>
<p>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,
Although the circuit be eleven miles,
And be not less than half a mile across.</p>
<p>For them am I in such a family;
They did induce me into coining florins,
Which had three carats of impurity.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;Who are the two poor wretches
That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,
Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I found them here,&quot; replied he, &quot;when I rained
Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,
Nor do I think they will for evermore.</p>
<p>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,
The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;
From acute fever they send forth such reek.&quot;</p>
<p>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed
At being, peradventure, named so darkly,
Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</p>
<p>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;
And Master Adam smote him in the face,
With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</p>
<p>Saying to him: &quot;Although be taken from me
All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,
I have an arm unfettered for such need.&quot;</p>
<p>Whereat he answer made: &quot;When thou didst go
Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:
But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.&quot;</p>
<p>The dropsical: &quot;Thou sayest true in that;
But thou wast not so true a witness there,
Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,&quot;
Said Sinon; &quot;and for one fault I am here,
And thou for more than any other demon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remember, perjurer, about the horse,&quot;
He made reply who had the swollen belly,
&quot;And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks
Thy tongue,&quot; the Greek said, &quot;and the putrid water
That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the false-coiner: &quot;So is gaping wide
Thy mouth for speaking evil, as &#x27;tis wont;
Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me</p>
<p>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,
And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus
Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.&quot;</p>
<p>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,
When said the Master to me: &quot;Now just look,
For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.&quot;</p>
<p>When him I heard in anger speak to me,
I turned me round towards him with such shame
That still it eddies through my memory.</p>
<p>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,
Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,
So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</p>
<p>Such I became, not having power to speak,
For to excuse myself I wished, and still
Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</p>
<p>&quot;Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,&quot;
The Master said, &quot;than this of thine has been;
Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,</p>
<p>And make account that I am aye beside thee,
If e&#x27;er it come to pass that fortune bring thee
Where there are people in a like dispute;</p>
<p>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXXI</p>
<p>One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,
So that it tinged the one cheek and the other,
And then held out to me the medicine;</p>
<p>Thus do I hear that once Achilles&#x27; spear,
His and his father&#x27;s, used to be the cause
First of a sad and then a gracious boon.</p>
<p>We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,
Upon the bank that girds it round about,
Going across it without any speech.</p>
<p>There it was less than night, and less than day,
So that my sight went little in advance;
But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,</p>
<p>So loud it would have made each thunder faint,
Which, counter to it following its way,
Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.</p>
<p>After the dolorous discomfiture
When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,
So terribly Orlando sounded not.</p>
<p>Short while my head turned thitherward I held
When many lofty towers I seemed to see,
Whereat I: &quot;Master, say, what town is this?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Because thou peerest forth
Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,
It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.</p>
<p>Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,
How much the sense deceives itself by distance;
Therefore a little faster spur thee on.&quot;</p>
<p>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,
And said: &quot;Before we farther have advanced,
That the reality may seem to thee</p>
<p>Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,
And they are in the well, around the bank,
From navel downward, one and all of them.&quot;</p>
<p>As, when the fog is vanishing away,
Little by little doth the sight refigure
Whate&#x27;er the mist that crowds the air conceals,</p>
<p>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,
More and more near approaching tow&#x27;rd the verge,
My error fled, and fear came over me;</p>
<p>Because as on its circular parapets
Montereggione crowns itself with towers,
E&#x27;en thus the margin which surrounds the well</p>
<p>With one half of their bodies turreted
The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces
E&#x27;en now from out the heavens when he thunders.</p>
<p>And I of one already saw the face,
Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,
And down along his sides both of the arms.</p>
<p>Certainly Nature, when she left the making
Of animals like these, did well indeed,
By taking such executors from Mars;</p>
<p>And if of elephants and whales she doth not
Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly
More just and more discreet will hold her for it;</p>
<p>For where the argument of intellect
Is added unto evil will and power,
No rampart can the people make against it.</p>
<p>His face appeared to me as long and large
As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter&#x27;s,
And in proportion were the other bones;</p>
<p>So that the margin, which an apron was
Down from the middle, showed so much of him
Above it, that to reach up to his hair</p>
<p>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;
For I beheld thirty great palms of him
Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.</p>

Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,
To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.</p>
<p>And unto him my Guide: &quot;Soul idiotic,
Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,
When wrath or other passion touches thee.</p>
<p>Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt
Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,
And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast.&quot;</p>
<p>Then said to me: &quot;He doth himself accuse;
This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought
One language in the world is not still used.</p>
<p>Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;
For even such to him is every language
As his to others, which to none is known.&quot;</p>
<p>Therefore a longer journey did we make,
Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft
We found another far more fierce and large.</p>
<p>In binding him, who might the master be
I cannot say; but he had pinioned close
Behind the right arm, and in front the other,</p>
<p>With chains, that held him so begirt about
From the neck down, that on the part uncovered
It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.</p>
<p>&quot;This proud one wished to make experiment
Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,&quot;
My Leader said, &quot;whence he has such a guerdon.</p>
<p>Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.
What time the giants terrified the gods;
The arms he wielded never more he moves.&quot;</p>
<p>And I to him: &quot;If possible, I should wish
That of the measureless Briareus
These eyes of mine might have experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Whence he replied: &quot;Thou shalt behold Antaeus
Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,
Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.</p>
<p>Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,
And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,
Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.&quot;</p>
<p>There never was an earthquake of such might
That it could shake a tower so violently,
As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.</p>
<p>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,
For nothing more was needful than the fear,
If I had not beheld the manacles.</p>
<p>Then we proceeded farther in advance,
And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells
Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.</p>
<p>&quot;O thou, who in the valley fortunate,
Which Scipio the heir of glory made,
When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,</p>
<p>Once brought&#x27;st a thousand lions for thy prey,
And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war
Among thy brothers, some it seems still think</p>
<p>The sons of Earth the victory would have gained:
Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,
There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.</p>
<p>Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;
This one can give of that which here is longed for;
Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.</p>
<p>Still in the world can he restore thy fame;
Because he lives, and still expects long life,
If to itself Grace call him not untimely.&quot;</p>
<p>So said the Master; and in haste the other
His hands extended and took up my Guide,--
Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.</p>
<p>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,
Said unto me: &quot;Draw nigh, that I may take thee;&quot;
Then of himself and me one bundle made.</p>
<p>As seems the Carisenda, to behold
Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud
Above it so that opposite it hangs;</p>
<p>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood
Watching to see him stoop, and then it was
I could have wished to go some other way.</p>
<p>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up
Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;
Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,</p>
<p>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXXII</p>
<p>If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,
As were appropriate to the dismal hole
Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,</p>
<p>I would press out the juice of my conception
More fully; but because I have them not,
Not without fear I bring myself to speak;</p>
<p>For &#x27;tis no enterprise to take in jest,
To sketch the bottom of all the universe,
Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.</p>
<p>But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,
Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,
That from the fact the word be not diverse.</p>
<p>O rabble ill-begotten above all,
Who&#x27;re in the place to speak of which is hard,
&#x27;Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!</p>
<p>When we were down within the darksome well,
Beneath the giant&#x27;s feet, but lower far,
And I was scanning still the lofty wall,</p>
<p>I heard it said to me: &quot;Look how thou steppest!
Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet
The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!&quot;</p>
<p>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me
And underfoot a lake, that from the frost
The semblance had of glass, and not of water.</p>
<p>So thick a veil ne&#x27;er made upon its current
In winter-time Danube in Austria,
Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,</p>
<p>As there was here; so that if Tambernich
Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,
E&#x27;en at the edge &#x27;twould not have given a creak.</p>
<p>And as to croak the frog doth place himself
With muzzle out of water,--when is dreaming
Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,--</p>
<p>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,
Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,
Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.</p>
<p>Each one his countenance held downward bent;
From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart
Among them witness of itself procures.</p>
<p>When round about me somewhat I had looked,
I downward turned me, and saw two so close,
The hair upon their heads together mingled.</p>
<p>&quot;Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,&quot;
I said, &quot;who are you;&quot; and they bent their necks,
And when to me their faces they had lifted,</p>
<p>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,
Gushed o&#x27;er the eyelids, and the frost congealed
The tears between, and locked them up again.</p>
<p>Clamp never bound together wood with wood
So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,
Butted together, so much wrath o&#x27;ercame them.</p>
<p>And one, who had by reason of the cold
Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,
Said: &quot;Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?</p>
<p>If thou desire to know who these two are,
The valley whence Bisenzio descends
Belonged to them and to their father Albert.</p>
<p>They from one body came, and all Caina
Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade
More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</p>
<p>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow
At one and the same blow by Arthur&#x27;s hand;
Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers</p>
<p>So with his head I see no farther forward,
And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;
Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.</p>
<p>And that thou put me not to further speech,
Know that I Camicion de&#x27; Pazzi was,
And wait Carlino to exonerate me.&quot;</p>
<p>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made
Purple with cold; whence o&#x27;er me comes a shudder,
And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.</p>
<p>And while we were advancing tow&#x27;rds the middle,
Where everything of weight unites together,
And I was shivering in the eternal shade,</p>
<p>Whether &#x27;twere will, or destiny, or chance,
I know not; but in walking &#x27;mong the heads
I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</p>
<p>Weeping he growled: &quot;Why dost thou trample me?
Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?&quot;</p>
<p>And I: &quot;My Master, now wait here for me,
That I through him may issue from a doubt;
Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.&quot;</p>
<p>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said
Who was blaspheming vehemently still:
&quot;Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora
Smiting,&quot; replied he, &quot;other people&#x27;s cheeks,
So that, if thou wert living, &#x27;twere too much?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,&quot;
Was my response, &quot;if thou demandest fame,
That &#x27;mid the other notes thy name I place.&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;For the reverse I long;
Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;
For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.&quot;</p>
<p>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,
And said: &quot;It must needs be thou name thyself,
Or not a hair remain upon thee here.&quot;</p>
<p>Whence he to me: &quot;Though thou strip off my hair,
I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,
If on my head a thousand times thou fall.&quot;</p>
<p>I had his hair in hand already twisted,
And more than one shock of it had pulled out,
He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,</p>
<p>When cried another: &quot;What doth ail thee, Bocca?
Is&#x27;t not enough to clatter with thy jaws,
But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said I, &quot;I care not to have thee speak,
Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame
I will report of thee veracious news.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Begone,&quot; replied he, &quot;and tell what thou wilt,
But be not silent, if thou issue hence,
Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;</p>
<p>He weepeth here the silver of the French;
&#x27;I saw,&#x27; thus canst thou phrase it, &#x27;him of Duera
There where the sinners stand out in the cold.&#x27;</p>
<p>If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,
Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,
Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;</p>
<p>Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be
Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello
Who oped Faenza when the people slep.&quot;</p>
<p>Already we had gone away from him,
When I beheld two frozen in one hole,
So that one head a hood was to the other;</p>
<p>And even as bread through hunger is devoured,
The uppermost on the other set his teeth,
There where the brain is to the nape united.</p>
<p>Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed
The temples of Menalippus in disdain,
Than that one did the skull and the other things.</p>
<p>&quot;O thou, who showest by such bestial sign
Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,
Tell me the wherefore,&quot; said I, &quot;with this compact,</p>
<p>That if thou rightfully of him complain,
In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,
I in the world above repay thee for it,</p>
<p>If that wherewith I speak be not dried up.&quot;</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXXIII</p>
<p>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,
That sinner, wiping it upon the hair
Of the same head that he behind had wasted.</p>
<p>Then he began: &quot;Thou wilt that I renew
The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already
To think of only, ere I speak of it;</p>
<p>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit
Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,
Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.</p>
<p>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode</p>
<p>Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine
Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</p>
<p>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,
And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;
Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.</p>
<p>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,
Trusting in him I was made prisoner,
And after put to death, I need not say;</p>
<p>But ne&#x27;ertheless what thou canst not have heard,
That is to say, how cruel was my death,
Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.</p>
<p>A narrow perforation in the mew,
Which bears because of me the title of Famine,
And in which others still must be locked up,</p>
<p>Had shown me through its opening many moons
Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
Which of the future rent for me the veil.</p>
<p>This one appeared to me as lord and master,
Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.</p>
<p>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,
Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi
He had sent out before him to the front.</p>
<p>After brief course seemed unto me forespent
The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes
It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</p>
<p>When I before the morrow was awake,
Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons
Who with me were, and asking after bread.</p>
<p>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,
Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,
And weep&#x27;st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</p>
<p>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh
At which our food used to be brought to us,
And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</p>
<p>And I heard locking up the under door
Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word
I gazed into the faces of my sons.</p>
<p>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;
They wept; and darling little Anselm mine
Said: &#x27;Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?&#x27;</p>
<p>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made
All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,
Until another sun rose on the world.</p>
<p>As now a little glimmer made its way
Into the dolorous prison, and I saw
Upon four faces my own very aspect,</p>
<p>Both of my hands in agony I bit;
And, thinking that I did it from desire
Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</p>
<p>And said they: &#x27;Father, much less pain &#x27;twill give us
If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us
With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.&#x27;</p>
<p>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.
That day we all were silent, and the next.
Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</p>
<p>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo
Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,
Saying, &#x27;My father, why dost thou not help me?&#x27;</p>
<p>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,
I saw the three fall, one by one, between
The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</p>
<p>Already blind, to groping over each,
And three days called them after they were dead;
Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.&quot;</p>
<p>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,
The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,
Which, as a dog&#x27;s, upon the bone were strong.</p>
<p>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people
Of the fair land there where the &#x27;Si&#x27; doth sound,
Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,</p>
<p>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,
And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno
That every person in thee it may drown!</p>
<p>For if Count Ugolino had the fame
Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,
Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.</p>
<p>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!
Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,
And the other two my song doth name above!</p>
<p>We passed still farther onward, where the ice
Another people ruggedly enswathes,
Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</p>
<p>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,
And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes
Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</p>
<p>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,
And, in the manner of a crystal visor,
Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</p>
<p>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,
Because of cold all sensibility
Its station had abandoned in my face,</p>
<p>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;
Whence I: &quot;My Master, who sets this in motion?
Is not below here every vapour quenched?&quot;</p>
<p>Whence he to me: &quot;Full soon shalt thou be where
Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,
Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast.&quot;</p>
<p>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust
Cried out to us: &quot;O souls so merciless
That the last post is given unto you,</p>
<p>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I
May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart
A little, e&#x27;er the weeping recongeal.&quot;</p>
<p>Whence I to him: &quot;If thou wouldst have me help thee
Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,
May I go to the bottom of the ice.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he replied: &quot;I am Friar Alberigo;
He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,
Who here a date am getting for my fig.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O,&quot; said I to him, &quot;now art thou, too, dead?&quot;
And he to me: &quot;How may my body fare
Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</p>
<p>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,
That oftentimes the soul descendeth here
Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.</p>
<p>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove
From off my countenance these glassy tears,
Know that as soon as any soul betrays</p>
<p>As I have done, his body by a demon
Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,
Until his time has wholly been revolved.</p>
<p>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;
And still perchance above appears the body
Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</p>
<p>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;
It is Ser Branca d&#x27; Oria, and many years
Have passed away since he was thus locked up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think,&quot; said I to him, &quot;thou dost deceive me;
For Branca d&#x27; Oria is not dead as yet,
And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In moat above,&quot; said he, &quot;of Malebranche,
There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,
As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</p>
<p>When this one left a devil in his stead
In his own body and one near of kin,
Who made together with him the betrayal.</p>
<p>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,
Open mine eyes;&quot;--and open them I did not,
And to be rude to him was courtesy.</p>
<p>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance
With every virtue, full of every vice
Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?</p>
<p>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna
I found of you one such, who for his deeds
In soul already in Cocytus bathes,</p>
<p>And still above in body seems alive!</p>
<p>Inferno: Canto XXXIV</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni&#x27;
Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,&quot;
My Master said, &quot;if thou discernest him.&quot;</p>
<p>As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when
Our hemisphere is darkening into night,
Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,</p>
<p>Methought that such a building then I saw;
And, for the wind, I drew myself behind
My Guide, because there was no other shelter.</p>
<p>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,
There where the shades were wholly covered up,
And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.</p>
<p>Some prone are lying, others stand erect,
This with the head, and that one with the soles;
Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.</p>
<p>When in advance so far we had proceeded,
That it my Master pleased to show to me
The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,</p>
<p>He from before me moved and made me stop,
Saying: &quot;Behold Dis, and behold the place
Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself.&quot;</p>
<p>How frozen I became and powerless then,
Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,
Because all language would be insufficient.</p>
<p>I did not die, and I alive remained not;
Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,
What I became, being of both deprived.</p>
<p>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous
From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;
And better with a giant I compare</p>
<p>Than do the giants with those arms of his;
Consider now how great must be that whole,
Which unto such a part conforms itself.</p>
<p>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,
And lifted up his brow against his Maker,
Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</p>
<p>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,
When I beheld three faces on his head!
The one in front, and that vermilion was;</p>
<p>Two were the others, that were joined with this
Above the middle part of either shoulder,
And they were joined together at the crest;</p>
<p>And the right-hand one seemed &#x27;twixt white and yellow;
The left was such to look upon as those
Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.</p>
<p>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,
Such as befitting were so great a bird;
Sails of the sea I never saw so large.</p>
<p>No feathers had they, but as of a bat
Their fashion was; and he was waving them,
So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</p>
<p>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.
With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins
Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.</p>
<p>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching
A sinner, in the manner of a brake,
So that he three of them tormented thus.</p>
<p>To him in front the biting was as naught
Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine
Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</p>
<p>&quot;That soul up there which has the greatest pain,&quot;
The Master said, &quot;is Judas Iscariot;
With head inside, he plies his legs without.</p>
<p>Of the two others, who head downward are,
The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;
See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.</p>
<p>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.
But night is reascending, and &#x27;tis time
That we depart, for we have seen the whole.&quot;</p>
<p>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,
And he the vantage seized of time and place,
And when the wings were opened wide apart,</p>
<p>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;
From fell to fell descended downward then
Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</p>
<p>When we were come to where the thigh revolves
Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,
The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,</p>
<p>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,
And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,
So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,&quot;
The Master said, panting as one fatigued,
&quot;Must we perforce depart from so much evil.&quot;</p>
<p>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,
And down upon the margin seated me;
Then tow&#x27;rds me he outstretched his wary step.</p>
<p>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see
Lucifer in the same way I had left him;
And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</p>
<p>And if I then became disquieted,
Let stolid people think who do not see
What the point is beyond which I had passed.</p>
<p>&quot;Rise up,&quot; the Master said, &quot;upon thy feet;
The way is long, and difficult the road,
And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.&quot;</p>
<p>It was not any palace corridor
There where we were, but dungeon natural,
With floor uneven and unease of light.</p>
<p>&quot;Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,
My Master,&quot; said I when I had arisen,
&quot;To draw me from an error speak a little;</p>
<p>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed
Thus upside down? and how in such short time
From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?&quot;</p>
<p>And he to me: &quot;Thou still imaginest
Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped
The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.</p>
<p>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;
When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point
To which things heavy draw from every side,</p>
<p>And now beneath the hemisphere art come
Opposite that which overhangs the vast
Dry-land, and &#x27;neath whose cope was put to death</p>
<p>The Man who without sin was born and lived.
Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere
Which makes the other face of the Judecca.</p>
<p>Here it is morn when it is evening there;
And he who with his hair a stairway made us
Still fixed remaineth as he was before.</p>
<p>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;
And all the land, that whilom here emerged,
For fear of him made of the sea a veil,</p>
<p>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure
To flee from him, what on this side appears
Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.&quot;</p>
<p>A place there is below, from Beelzebub
As far receding as the tomb extends,
Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</p>
<p>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth
Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed
With course that winds about and slightly falls.</p>
<p>The Guide and I into that hidden road
Now entered, to return to the bright world;
And without care of having any rest</p>
<p>We mounted up, he first and I the second,
Till I beheld through a round aperture
Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;</p>
<p>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><a
