Puzzle of Dickens&#x27;s Last Plot</h1></header><p>The Puzzle of Dickens&#x27;s Last Plot</p>
<p>by Andrew Lang</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>FORSTER tells us that Dickens, in his later novels, from BLEAK HOUSE  onwards (1853), &quot;assiduously cultivated&quot; construction, &quot;this essential  of his art.&quot;  Some critics may think, that since so many of the best  novels in the world &quot;have no outline, or, if they have an outline, it  is a demned outline,&quot; elaborate construction is not absolutely  &quot;essential.&quot;  Really essential are character, &quot;atmosphere,&quot; humour.</p>
<p>But as, in the natural changes of life, and under the strain of  restless and unsatisfied activity, his old buoyancy and unequalled  high spirits deserted Dickens, he certainly wrote no longer in what  Scott, speaking of himself, calls the manner of &quot;hab nab at a  venture.&quot;  He constructed elaborate plots, rich in secrets and  surprises.  He emulated the manner of Wilkie Collins, or even of  Gaboriau, while he combined with some of the elements of the detective  novel, or ROMAN POLICIER, careful study of character.  Except GREAT  EXPECTATIONS, none of his later tales rivals in merit his early  picaresque stories of the road, such as PICKWICK and NICHOLAS  NICKLEBY.  &quot;Youth will be served;&quot; no sedulous care could compensate  for the exuberance of &quot;the first sprightly runnings.&quot;  In the early  books the melodrama of the plot, the secrets of Ralph Nickleby, of  Monk, of Jonas Chuzzlewit, were the least of the innumerable  attractions.  But Dickens was more and more drawn towards the secret  that excites curiosity, and to the game of hide and seek with the  reader who tried to anticipate the solution of the secret.</p>
<p>In April, 1869, Dickens, outworn by the strain of his American  readings; of that labour achieved under painful conditions of  ominously bad health - found himself, as Sir Thomas Watson reported,  &quot;on the brink of an attack of paralysis of his left side, and possibly  of apoplexy.&quot;  He therefore abandoned a new series of Readings.  We  think of Scott&#x27;s earlier seizures of a similar kind, after which  PEVERIL, he said, &quot;smacked of the apoplexy.&quot;  But Dickens&#x27;s new story  of THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD, first contemplated in July, 1869, and  altered in character by the emergence of &quot;a very curious and new  idea,&quot; early in August, does not &quot;smack of the apoplexy.&quot;  We may  think that the mannerisms of Mr. Honeythunder, the philanthropist, and  of Miss Twinkleton, the schoolmistress, are not in the author&#x27;s best  vein of humour.  &quot;The Billickin,&quot; on the other hand, the lodging-house  keeper, is &quot;in very gracious fooling:&quot; her unlooked-for sallies in  skirmishes with Miss Twinkleton are rich in mirthful surprises.  Mr.  Grewgious may be caricatured too much, but not out of reason; and  Dickens, always good at boys, presents a GAMIN, in Deputy, who is in  not unpleasant contrast with the pathetic Jo of BLEAK HOUSE.  Opinions  may differ as to Edwin and Rosa, but the more closely one studies  Edwin, the better one thinks of that character.  As far as we are  allowed to see Helena Landless, the restraint which she puts on her  &quot;tigerish blood&quot; is admirable:  she is very fresh and original.  The  villain is all that melodrama can desire, but what we do miss, I  think, is the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of a small cathedral town.  Here there is a  lack of softness and delicacy of treatment:  on the other hand, the  opium den is studied from the life.</p>
<p>On the whole, Dickens himself was perhaps most interested in his plot,  his secret, his surprises, his game of hide and seek with the reader.   He threw himself into the sport with zest:  he spoke to his sister-in- law, Miss Hogarth, about his fear that he had not sufficiently  concealed his tracks in the latest numbers.  Yet, when he died in  June, 1870, leaving three completed numbers still unpublished, he left  his secret as a puzzle to the curious.  Many efforts have been made to  decipher his purpose, especially his intentions as to the hero.  Was  Edwin Drood killed, or did he escape?</p>
<p>By a coincidence, in September, 1869, Dickens was working over the  late Lord Lytton&#x27;s tale for ALL THE YEAR ROUND, &quot;The Disappearance of  John Ackland,&quot; for the purpose of mystifying the reader as to whether  Ackland was alive or dead.  But he was conspicuously defunct!  (ALL  THE YEAR ROUND, September-October, 1869.)</p>
<p>The most careful of the attempts at a reply about Edwin, a study based  on deep knowledge of Dickens, is &quot;Watched by the Dead,&quot; by the late  ingenious Mr. R. A. Proctor (1887).  This book, to which I owe much  aid, is now out of print.  In 1905, Mr. Cuming Walters revived &quot;the  auld mysterie,&quot; in his &quot;Clues to Dickens&#x27;s Edwin Drood&quot; (Chapman &amp;  Hall and Heywood, Manchester).  From the solution of Mr. Walters I am  obliged to dissent.  Of Mr. Proctor&#x27;s theory I offer some necessary  corrections, and I hope that I have unravelled some skeins which Mr.  Proctor left in a state of tangle.  As one read and re-read the  fragment, points very dark seemed, at least, to become suddenly clear:   especially one appeared to understand the meaning half-revealed and  half-concealed by Jasper&#x27;s babblings under the influence of opium.  He  saw in his vision, &quot;THAT, I never saw THAT before.&quot;  We may be sure  that he was to see &quot;THAT&quot; in real life.  We must remember that,  according to Forster, &quot;such was Dickens&#x27;s interest in things  supernatural that, but for the strong restraining power of his common  sense, he might have fallen into the follies of spiritualism.&quot;  His  interest in such matters certainly peeps out in this novel - there are  two specimens of the supernormal - and he may have gone to the limited  extent which my hypothesis requires.  If I am right, Dickens went  further, and fared worse, in the too material premonitions of &quot;The  Signalman&quot; in MUGBY JUNCTION.</p>
<p>With this brief preface, I proceed to the analysis of Dickens&#x27;s last  plot.  Mr. William Archer has kindly read the proof sheets and made  valuable suggestions, but is responsible for none of my theories.</p>
<p>ANDREW LANG. ST. ANDREWS, SEPTEMBER 4, 1905.</p>
<p>THE STORY - DRAMATIS PERSONAE</p>
<p>FOR the discovery of Dickens&#x27;s secret in EDWIN DROOD it is necessary  to obtain a clear view of the characters in the tale, and of their  relations to each other.</p>
<p>About the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in Cloisterham,  a cathedral city sketched from Rochester, a young University man, Mr.  Bud, who had a friend Mr. Drood, one of a firm of engineers -  somewhere.  They were &quot;fast friends and old college companions.&quot;  Both  married young.  Mr. Bud wedded a lady unnamed, by whom he was the  father of one child, a daughter, Rosa Bud.  Mr. Drood, whose wife&#x27;s  maiden name was Jasper, had one son, Edwin Drood.  Mrs. Bud was  drowned in a boating accident, when her daughter, Rosa, was a child.   Mr. Drood, already a widower, and the bereaved Mr. Bud &quot;betrothed&quot; the  two children, Rosa and Edwin, and then expired, when the orphans were  about seven and eleven years old.  The guardian of Rosa was a lawyer,  Mr. Grewgious, who had been in love with her mother.  To Grewgious Mr.  Bud entrusted his wife&#x27;s engagement ring, rubies and diamonds, which  Grewgious was to hand over to Edwin Drood, if, when he attained his  majority, he and Rosa decided to marry.</p>
<p>Grewgious was apparently legal agent for Edwin, while Edwin&#x27;s maternal  uncle, John Jasper (aged about sixteen when the male parents died),  was Edwin&#x27;s &quot;trustee,&quot; as well as his uncle and devoted friend.   Rosa&#x27;s little fortune was an annuity producing ?50 a-year:  Edwin  succeeded to his father&#x27;s share in an engineering firm.</p>
<p>When the story opens, Edwin is nearly twenty-one, and is about to  proceed to Egypt, as an engineer.  Rosa, at school in Cloisterham, is  about seventeen; John Jasper is twenty-six.  He is conductor of the  Choir of the Cathedral, a &quot;lay precentor;&quot; he is very dark, with thick  black whiskers, and, for a number of years, has been a victim to the  habit of opium smoking.  He began very early.  He takes this drug both  in his lodgings, over the gate of the Cathedral, and in a den in East  London, kept by a woman nicknamed &quot;The Princess Puffer.&quot;  This hag, we  learn, has been a determined drunkard, - &quot;I drank heaven&#x27;s-hard,&quot; -  for sixteen years BEFORE she took to opium.  If she has been dealing  in opium for ten years (the exact period is not stated), she has been  very disreputable for twenty-six years, that is ever since John  Jasper&#x27;s birth.  Mr. Cuming Walters suggests that she is the mother of  John Jasper, and, therefore, maternal grandmother of Edwin Drood.  She  detests her client, Jasper, and plays the spy on his movements, for  reasons unexplained.</p>
<p>Jasper is secretly in love with Rosa, the FIANCEE of his nephew, and  his own pupil in the musical art.  He makes her aware of his passion,  silently, and she fears and detests him, but keeps these emotions  private.  She is a saucy school-girl, and she and Edwin are on  uncomfortable terms:  she does not love him, while he perhaps does  love her, but is annoyed by her manner, and by the gossip about their  betrothal.  &quot;The bloom is off the plum&quot; of their prearranged loves, he  says to his friend, uncle, and confidant, Jasper, whose own concealed  passion for Rosa is of a ferocious and homicidal character.  Rosa is  aware of this fact; &quot;a glaze comes over his eyes,&quot; sometimes, she  says, &quot;and he seems to wander away into a frightful sort of dream, in  which he threatens most. . . The man appears to have these frightful  dreams even when he is not under opium.</p>
<p>OPENING OF THE TALE</p>
<p>The tale opens abruptly with an opium-bred vision of the tower of  Cloisterham Cathedral, beheld by Jasper as he awakens in the den of  the Princess Puffer, between a Chinaman, a Lascar, and the hag  herself.  This Cathedral tower, thus early and emphatically  introduced, is to play a great but more or less mysterious part in the  romance:  that is certain.  Jasper, waking, makes experiments on the  talk of the old woman, the Lascar and Chinaman in their sleep.  He  pronounces it &quot;unintelligible,&quot; which satisfies him that his own  babble, when under opium, must be unintelligible also.  He is,  presumably, acquainted with the languages of the eastern coast of  India, and with Chinese, otherwise, how could he hope to understand  the sleepers?  He is being watched by the hag, who hates him.</p>
<p>Jasper returns to Cloisterham, where we are introduced to the Dean, a  nonentity, and to Minor Canon Crisparkle, a muscular Christian in the  pink of training, a classical scholar, and a good honest fellow.   Jasper gives Edwin a dinner, and gushes over &quot;his bright boy,&quot; a  lively lad, full of chaff, but also full of confiding affection and  tenderness of heart.  Edwin admits that his betrothal is a bore:   Jasper admits that he loathes his life; and that the church singing  &quot;often sounds to me quite devilish,&quot; - and no wonder.  After this  dinner, Jasper has a &quot;weird seizure;&quot; &quot;a strange film comes over  Jasper&#x27;s eyes,&quot; he &quot;looks frightfully ill,&quot; becomes rigid, and admits  that he &quot;has been taking opium for a pain, an agony that sometimes  overcomes me.&quot;  This &quot;agony,&quot; we learn, is the pain of hearing Edwin  speak lightly of his love, whom Jasper so furiously desires.  &quot;Take it  as a warning,&quot; Jasper says, but Edwin, puzzled, and full of confiding  tenderness, does not understand.</p>
<p>In the next scene we meet the school-girl, Rosa, who takes a walk and  has a tiff with Edwin.  Sir Luke Fildes&#x27;s illustration shows Edwin as  &quot;a lad with the bloom of a lass,&quot; with a CLASSIC PROFILE; AND A  GRACIOUS HEAD OF LONG, THICK, FAIR HAIR, long, though we learn it has  just been cut.  He wears a soft slouched hat, and the pea-coat of the  period.</p>
<p>SAPSEA AND DURDLES</p>
<p>Next, Jasper and Sapsea, a pompous ass, auctioneer, and mayor, sit at  their wine, expecting a third guest.  Mr. Sapsea reads his absurd  epitaph for his late wife, who is buried in a &quot;Monument,&quot; a vault of  some sort in the Cathedral churchyard.  To them enter Durdles, a man  never sober, yet trusted with the key of the crypt, &quot;as contractor for  rough repairs.&quot;  In the crypt &quot;he habitually sleeps off the fumes of  liquor.&quot;  Of course no Dean would entrust keys to this incredibly  dissipated, dirty, and insolent creature, to whom Sapsea gives the key  of his vault, for no reason at all, as the epitaph, of course, is to  be engraved on the outside, by Durdles&#x27;s men.  However, Durdles  insists on getting the key of the vault:  he has two other large keys.   Jasper, trifling with them, keeps clinking them together, so as to  know, even in the dark, by the sound, which is the key that opens  Sapsea&#x27;s vault, in the railed-off burial ground, beside the cloister  arches.  He has met Durdles at Sapsea&#x27;s for no other purpose than to  obtain access at will to Mrs. Sapsea&#x27;s monument.  Later in the evening  Jasper finds Durdles more or less drunk, and being stoned by a GAMIN,</p>
<p>&quot;Deputy,&quot; a retainer of a tramp&#x27;s lodging-house.  Durdles fees Deputy,  in fact, to drive him home every night after ten.  Jasper and Deputy  fall into feud, and Jasper has thus a new, keen, and omnipresent  enemy.  As he walks with Durdles that worthy explains (in reply to a  question by Jasper), that, by tapping a wall, even if over six feet  thick, with his hammer, he can detect the nature of the contents of  the vault, &quot;solid in hollow, and inside solid, hollow again.  Old &#x27;un  crumbled away in stone coffin, in vault.&quot;  He can also discover the  presence of &quot;rubbish left in that same six foot space by Durdles&#x27;s  men.&quot;  Thus, if a foreign body were introduced into the Sapsea vault,  Durdles could detect its presence by tapping the outside wall.  As  Jasper&#x27;s purpose clearly is to introduce a foreign body - that of  Edwin who stands between him and Rosa - into Mrs. Sapsea&#x27;s vault, this  &quot;gift&quot; of Durdles is, for Jasper, an uncomfortable discovery.  He goes  home, watches Edwin asleep, and smokes opium.</p>
<p>THE LANDLESSES</p>
<p>Two new characters are now introduced, Neville and Helena Landless,  (1) twins, orphans, of Cingalese extraction, probably Eurasian; very  dark, the girl &quot;almost of the gipsy type;&quot; both are &quot;fierce of look.&quot;   The young man is to read with Canon Crisparkle and live with him; the  girl goes to the same school as Rosa.  The education of both has been  utterly neglected; instruction has been denied to them.  Neville  explains the cause of their fierceness to Crisparkle.  In Ceylon they  were bullied by a cruel stepfather and several times ran away:  the  girl was the leader, always &quot;DRESSED AS A BOY, AND SHOWING THE DARING  OF A MAN.&quot;  Edwin Drood&#x27;s air of supercilious ownership of Rosa Bud  (indicated as a fault of youth and circumstance, not of heart and  character), irritates Neville Landless, who falls in love with Rosa at  first sight.  As Rosa sings, at Crisparkle&#x27;s, while Jasper plays the  piano, Jasper&#x27;s fixed stare produces an hysterical fit in the girl,  who is soothed by Helena Landless.  Helena shows her aversion to  Jasper, who, as even Edwin now sees, frightens Rosa.  &quot;You would be  afraid of him, under similar circumstances, wouldn&#x27;t you, Miss  Landless?&quot; asks Edwin.  &quot;Not under any circumstances,&quot; answers Helena,  and Jasper &quot;thanks Miss Landless for this vindication of his  character.&quot;</p>
<p>The girls go back to their school, where Rosa explains to Helena her  horror of Jasper&#x27;s silent love-making:  &quot;I feel that I am never safe  from him . . . a glaze comes over his eyes and he seems to wander away  into a frightful sort of dream in which he threatens most,&quot; as already  quoted.  Helena thus, and she alone, except Rosa, understands Jasper  thoroughly.  She becomes Rosa&#x27;s protectress.  &quot;LET WHOMSOEVER IT MOST  CONCERNED LOOK WELL TO IT.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus Jasper has a new observer and enemy, in addition to the  omnipresent street boy, Deputy, and the detective old hag of the opium  den.</p>
<p>Leaving the Canon&#x27;s house, Neville and Edwin quarrel violently over  Rosa, in the open air; they are followed by Jasper, and taken to his  house to be reconciled over glasses of mulled wine.  Jasper drugs the  wine, and thus provokes a violent scene; next day he tells Crisparkle  that Neville is &quot;murderous.&quot;  &quot;There is something of the tiger in his  dark blood.&quot;  He spreads the story of the FRACAS in the town.</p>
<p>Grewgious, Rosa&#x27;s guardian, now comes down on business; the girl fails  to explain to him the unsatisfactory relations between her and Edwin:   Grewgious is to return to her &quot;at Christmas,&quot; if she sends for him,  and she does send.  Grewgious, &quot;an angular man,&quot; all duty and  sentiment (he had loved Rosa&#x27;s mother), has an interview with Edwin&#x27;s  trustee, Jasper, for whom he has no enthusiasm, but whom he does not  in any way suspect.  They part on good terms, to meet at Christmas.   Crisparkle, with whom Helena has fallen suddenly in love, arranges  with Jasper that Edwin and Landless shall meet and be reconciled, as  both are willing to be, at a dinner in Jasper&#x27;s rooms, on Christmas  Eve.  Jasper, when Crisparkle proposes this, denotes by his manner  &quot;some close internal calculation.&quot;  We see that he is reckoning how  the dinner suits his plan of campaign, and &quot;CLOSE calculation&quot; may  refer, as in Mr. Proctor&#x27;s theory, to the period of the moon:  ON  CHRISTMAS EVE THERE WILL BE NO MOONSHINE AT MIDNIGHT.  JASPER, having  worked out this problem, accepts Crisparkle&#x27;s proposal, and his  assurances about Neville, and shows Crisparkle a diary in which he has  entered his fears that Edwin&#x27;s life is in danger from Neville.  Edwin  (who is not in Cloisterham at this moment) accepts, by letter, the  invitation to meet Neville at Jasper&#x27;s on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Edwin visits Grewgious in his London chambers; is lectured  on his laggard and supercilious behaviour as a lover, and receives the  engagement ring of the late Mrs. Bud, Rosa&#x27;s mother, which is very  dear to Grewgious - in the presence of Bazzard, Grewgious&#x27;s clerk, a  gloomy writer of an amateur unacted tragedy.  Edwin is to return the  ring to Grewgious, if he and Rosa decide not to marry.  The ring is in  a case, and Edwin places it &quot;in his breast.&quot;  We must understand, in  the breast-pocket of his coat:  no other interpretation will pass  muster.  &quot;Her ring - will it come back to me?&quot; reflects the mournful  Grewgious.</p>
<p>THE UNACCOUNTABLE EXPEDITION</p>
<p>Jasper now tells Sapsea, and the Dean, that he is to make &quot;a moonlight  expedition with Durdles among the tombs, vaults, towers, and ruins to- night.&quot;  The impossible Durdles has the keys necessary for this,  &quot;surely an unaccountable expedition,&quot; Dickens keeps remarking.  The  moon seems to rise on this night at about 7.30 p.m.  Jasper takes a  big case-bottle of liquor - drugged, of course and goes to the den of  Durdles.  In the yard of this inspector of monuments he is bidden to  beware of a mound of quicklime near the yard gate.  &quot;With a little  handy stirring, quick enough to eat your bones,&quot; says Durdles.  There  is some considerable distance between this &quot;mound&quot; of quicklime and  the crypt, of which Durdles has the key, but the intervening space is  quite empty of human presence, as the citizens are unwilling to meet  ghosts.</p>
<p>In the crypt Durdles drinks a good deal of the drugged liquor.  &quot;They  are to ascend the great Tower,&quot; - and why they do that is part of the  Mystery, though not an insoluble part.  Before they climb, Durdles  tells Jasper that he was drunk and asleep in the crypt, last Christmas  Eve, and was wakened by &quot;the ghost of one terrific shriek, followed by  the ghost of the howl of a dog, a long dismal, woeful howl, such as a  dog gives when a person&#x27;s dead.&quot;  Durdles has made inquiries and, as  no one else heard the shriek and the howl, he calls these sounds  &quot;ghosts.&quot;</p>
<p>They are obviously meant to be understood as supranormal premonitory  sounds; of the nature of second sight, or rather of second hearing.   Forster gives examples of Dickens&#x27;s tendency to believe in such  premonitions:  Dickens had himself a curious premonitory dream.  He  considerably overdid the premonitory business in his otherwise  excellent story, THE SIGNALMAN, or so it seems to a student of these  things.  The shriek and howl heard by Durdles are to be repeated, we  see, in real life, later, on a Christmas Eve.  The question is - when?   More probably NOT on the Christmas Eve just imminent, when Edwin is to  vanish, but, on the Christmas Eve following, when Jasper is to be  unmasked.</p>
<p>All this while, and later, Jasper examines Durdles very closely,  studying the effects on him of the drugged drink.  When they reach the  top of the tower, Jasper closely contemplates &quot;that stillest part of  it&quot; (the landscape) &quot;which the Cathedral overshadows; but he  contemplates Durdles quite as curiously.&quot;</p>
<p>There is a motive for the scrutiny in either case.  Jasper examines  the part of the precincts in the shadow of the Cathedral, because he  wishes to assure himself that it is lonely enough for his later  undescribed but easily guessed proceedings in this night of mystery.   He will have much to do that could not brook witnesses, after the  drugged Durdles has fallen sound asleep.  We have already been assured  that the whole area over which Jasper is to operate is &quot;utterly  deserted,&quot; even when it lies in full moonlight, about 8.30 p.m.  &quot;One  might fancy that the tide of life was stemmed by Mr. Jasper&#x27;s own  gate-house.&quot;  The people of Cloisterham, we hear, would deny that they  believe in ghosts; but they give this part of the precinct a wide  berth (Chapter XII.).  If the region is &quot;utterly deserted&quot; at nine  o&#x27;clock in the evening, when it lies in the ivory moonlight, much more  will it be free from human presence when it lies in shadow, between  one and two o&#x27;clock after midnight.  Jasper, however, from the tower  top closely scrutinizes the area of his future operations.  It is,  probably, for this very purpose of discovering whether the coast be  clear or not, that Jasper climbs the tower.</p>
<p>He watches Durdles for the purpose of finding how the drug which he  has administered works, with a view to future operations on Edwin.   Durdles is now in such a state that &quot;he deems the ground so far below  on a level with the tower, and would as lief walk off the tower into  the air as not.&quot;</p>
<p>All this is apparently meant to suggest that Jasper, on Christmas Eve,  will repeat his expedition, WITH EDWIN, whom he will have drugged, and  that he will allow Edwin to &quot;walk off the tower into the air.&quot;  There  are later suggestions to the same effect, as we shall see, but they  are deliberately misleading.  There are also strong suggestions to the  very opposite effect:  it is broadly indicated that Jasper is to  strangle Edwin with a thick black-silk scarf, which he has just taken  to wearing for the good of his throat.</p>
<p>The pair return to the crypt, Durdles falls asleep, dreams that Jasper  leaves him, &quot;and that something touches him and something falls from  his hand.  Then something clinks and gropes about,&quot; and the lines of  moonlight shift their direction, as Durdles finds that they have  really done when he wakens, with Jasper beside him, while the  Cathedral clock strikes two.  They have had many hours, not less than  five, for their expedition.  The key of the crypt lies beside Durdles  on the ground.  They go out, and as Deputy begins stone-throwing,  Jasper half strangles him.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF THE EXPEDITION</p>
<p>Jasper has had ample time to take models in wax of all Durdles&#x27;s keys.   But he could have done that in a few minutes, while Durdles slept, if  he had wax with him, without leaving the crypt.  He has also had time  to convey several wheelbarrowfuls of quicklime from Durdles&#x27;s yard to  Mrs. Sapsea&#x27;s sepulchre, of which monument he probably took the key  from Durdles, and tried its identity by clinking.  But even in a  Cathedral town, even after midnight, several successive expeditions of  a lay precentor with a wheelbarrow full of quicklime would have been  apt to attract the comment of some belated physician, some cleric  coming from a sick bed, or some local roysterers.  Therefore it is  that Dickens insists on the &quot;utterly deserted&quot; character of the area,  and shows us that Jasper has made sure of that essential fact by  observations from the tower top.  Still, his was a perilous  expedition, with his wheelbarrow!  We should probably learn later,  that Jasper was detected by the wakeful Deputy, who loathed him.   Moreover, next morning Durdles was apt to notice that some of his  quicklime had been removed.  As far as is shown, Durdles noticed  nothing of that kind, though he does observe peculiarities in Jasper&#x27;s  behaviour.</p>
<p>The next point in the tale is that Edwin and Rosa meet, and have sense  enough to break off their engagement.  But Edwin, represented as  really good-hearted, now begins to repent his past behaviour, and,  though he has a kind of fancy for Miss Landless, he pretty clearly  falls deeper in love with his late FIANCEE, and weeps his loss in  private:  so we are told.</p>
<p>CHRISTMAS EVE</p>
<p>Christmas Eve comes, the day of the dinner of three, Jasper, Landless,  and Edwin.  The chapter describing this fateful day (xiv.) is headed,  WHEN SHALL THESE THREE MEET AGAIN? and Mr. Proctor argues that Dickens  intends that THEY SHALL meet again.  The intention, and the hint, are  much in Dickens&#x27;s manner.  Landless means to start, next day, very  early, on a solitary walking tour, and buys an exorbitantly heavy  stick.  We casually hear that Jasper knows Edwin to possess no  jewellery, except a watch and chain and a scarf-pin.  As Edwin moons  about, he finds the old opium hag, come down from London, &quot;seeking a  needle in a bottle of hay,&quot; she says - that is, hunting vainly for  Jasper.</p>
<p>Please remark that Jasper has run up to town, on December 23, and has  saturated his system with a debauch of opium on the very eve of the  day when he clearly means to kill Edwin.  This was a most injudicious  indulgence, in the circumstances.  A maiden murder needs nerve!  We  know that &quot;fiddlestrings was weakness to express the state of&quot;  Jasper&#x27;s &quot;nerves&quot; on the day after the night of opium with which the  story opens.  On December 24, Jasper returned home, the hag at his  heels.  The old woman, when met by Edwin, has a curious film over her  eyes; &quot;he seems to know her.&quot;  &quot;Great heaven,&quot; he thinks, next moment.   &quot;Like Jack that night!&quot;  This refers to a kind of fit of Jasper&#x27;s,  after dinner, on the first evening of the story.  Edwin has then seen  Jack Jasper in one of his &quot;filmy&quot; seizures.  The woman prays Edwin for  three shillings and six-pence, to buy opium.  He gives her the money;  she asks his Christian name.  &quot;Edwin.&quot;  Is &quot;Eddy&quot; a sweetheart&#x27;s form  of that?  He says that he has no sweetheart.  He is told to be  thankful that his name is not Ned.  Now, Jasper alone calls Edwin  &quot;Ned.&quot;  &quot;&#x27;Ned&#x27; is a threatened name, a dangerous name,&quot; says the hag,  who has heard Jasper threaten &quot;Ned&quot; in his opium dreams.</p>
<p>Edwin determines to tell this adventure to Jasper, BUT NOT ON THIS  NIGHT:  to-morrow will do.  Now, DID he tell the story to Jasper that  night, in the presence of Landless, at dinner?  If so, Helena Landless  might later learn the fact from Neville.  If she knew it, she would  later tell Mr. Grewgious.</p>
<p>The three men meet and dine.  There is a fearful storm.  &quot;Stones are  displaced upon the summit of the great tower.&quot;  Next morning, early,  Jasper yells to Crisparkle, who is looking out of his window in Minor  Canon Row, that Edwin has disappeared.  Neville has already set out on  his walking tour.</p>
<p>AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE</p>
<p>Men go forth and apprehend Neville, who shows fight with his heavy  stick.  We learn that he and Drood left Jasper&#x27;s house at midnight,  went for ten minutes to look at the river under the wind, and parted  at Crisparkle&#x27;s door.  Neville now remains under suspicion:  Jasper  directs the search in the river, on December 25, 26, and 27.  On the  evening of December 27, Grewgious visits Jasper.  Now, Grewgious, as  we know, was to be at Cloisterham at Christmas.  True, he was engaged  to dine on Christmas Day with Bazzard, his clerk; but, thoughtful as  he was of the moody Bazzard, as Edwin was leaving Cloisterham he would  excuse himself.  He would naturally take a great part in the search  for Edwin, above all as Edwin had in his possession the ring so dear  to the lawyer.  Edwin had not shown it to Rosa when they determined to  part.  He &quot;kept it in his breast,&quot; and the ring, we learn, was &quot;GIFTED  WITH INVINCIBLE FORCE TO HOLD AND DRAG,&quot; so Dickens warns us.</p>
<p>The ring is obviously to be a PIECE DE CONVICTION.  BUT our point, at  present, is that we do not know how Grewgious, to whom this ring was  so dear, employed himself at Cloisterham - after Edwin&#x27;s disappearance  - between December 25 and December 27.  On the evening of the 27th, he  came to Jasper, saying, &quot;I have JUST LEFT MISS LANDLESS.&quot;  He then  slowly and watchfully told Jasper that Edwin&#x27;s engagement was broken  off, while the precentor gasped, perspired, tore his hair, shrieked,  and finally subsided into a heap of muddy clothes on the floor.   Meanwhile, Mr. Grewgious, calmly observing these phenomena, warmed his  hands at the fire for some time before he called in Jasper&#x27;s landlady.</p>
<p>Grewgious now knows by Jasper&#x27;s behaviour that he believes himself to  have committed a superfluous crime, by murdering Edwin, who no longer  stood between him and Rosa, as their engagement was already at an end.   Whether a Jasper, in real life, would excite himself so much, is  another question.  We do not know, as Mr. Proctor insists, what Mr.  Grewgious had been doing at Cloisterham between Christmas Day and  December 27, the date of his experiment on Jasper&#x27;s nerves.  Mr.  Proctor supposes him to have met the living Edwin, and obtained  information from him, after his escape from a murderous attack by  Jasper.  Mr. Proctor insists that this is the only explanation of  Grewgious&#x27;s conduct, any other &quot;is absolutely impossible.&quot;  In that  case the experiment of Grewgious was not made to gain information from  Jasper&#x27;s demeanour, but was the beginning of his punishment, and was  intended by Grewgious to be so.</p>
<p>But Dickens has been careful to suggest, with suspicious breadth of  candour, another explanation of the source of Grewgious&#x27;s knowledge.   If Edwin has really escaped, and met Grewgious, Dickens does not want  us to be sure of that, as Mr. Proctor was sure.  Dickens deliberately  puts his readers on another trail, though neither Mr. Walters nor Mr.  Proctor struck the scent.  As we have noted, Grewgious at once says to  Jasper, &quot;I HAVE JUST COME FROM MISS LANDLESS.&quot;  This tells Jasper  nothing, but it tells a great deal to the watchful reader, who  remembers that Miss Landless, and she only, is aware that Jasper  loves, bullies, and insults Rosa, and that Rosa&#x27;s life is embittered  by Jasper&#x27;s silent wooing, and his unspoken threats.  Helena may also  know that &quot;Ned is a threatened name,&quot; as we have seen, and that the  menace comes from Jasper.  As Jasper is now known to be Edwin&#x27;s rival  in love, and as Edwin has vanished, the murderer, Mr. Grewgious  reckons, is Jasper; and his experiment, with Jasper&#x27;s consequent  shriek and fit, confirms the hypothesis.  Thus Grewgious had  information enough, from Miss Landless, to suggest his experiment -  Dickens intentionally made that clear (though not clear enough for Mr.  Proctor and Mr. Cuming Walters) - while his experiment gives him a  moral certainty of Jasper&#x27;s crime, but yields no legal evidence.</p>
<p>But does Grewgious know no more than what Helena, and the fit and  shriek of Jasper, have told him?  Is his knowledge limited to the  evidence that Jasper has murdered Edwin?  Or does Grewgious know more,  know that Edwin, in some way, has escaped from death?</p>
<p>That is Dickens&#x27;s secret.  But whereas Grewgious, if he believes  Jasper to be an actual murderer, should take him seriously; in point  of fact, he speaks of Jasper in so light a tone, as &quot;our local  friend,&quot; that we feel no certainty that he is not really aware of  Edwin&#x27;s escape from a murderous attack by Jasper, and of his continued  existence.</p>
<p>Presently Crisparkle, under some mysterious impression, apparently  telepathic (the book is rich in such psychical phenomena), visits the  weir on the river, at night, and next day finds Edwin&#x27;s watch and  chain in the timbers; his scarf-pin in the pool below.  The watch and  chain must have been placed purposely where they were found, they  could not float thither, and, if Neville had slain Edwin, he would not  have stolen his property, of course, except as a blind, neutralised by  the placing of the watch in a conspicuous spot.  However, the  increased suspicions drive Neville away to read law in Staple Inn,  where Grewgious also dwells, and incessantly watches Neville out of  his window.</p>
<p>About six months later, Helena Landless is to join Neville, who is  watched at intervals by Jasper, who, again, is watched by Grewgious as  the precentor lurks about Staple Inn.</p>
<p>DICK DATCHERY</p>
<p>About the time when Helena leaves Cloisterham for town, a new  character appears in Cloisterham, &quot;a white-headed personage with black  eyebrows, BUTTONED UP IN A TIGHTISH BLUE SURTOUT, with a buff  waistcoat, grey trowsers, and something of a military air.&quot;  His shock  of white hair was unusually thick and ample.  This man, &quot;a buffer  living idly on his means,&quot; named Datchery, is either, as Mr. Proctor  believed, Edwin Drood, or, as Mr. Walters thinks, Helena Landless.  By  making Grewgious drop the remark that Bazzard, his clerk, a moping owl  of an amateur tragedian, &quot;is off duty here,&quot; at his chambers, Dickens  hints that Bazzard is Datchery.  But that is a mere false scent, a  ruse of the author, scattering paper in the wrong place, in this long  paper hunt.</p>
<p>As for Helena, Mr. Walters justly argues that Dickens has marked her  for some important part in the ruin of Jasper.  &quot;There was a  slumbering gleam of fire in her intense dark eyes.  Let whomsoever it  most concerned look well to it.&quot;  Again, we have been told that Helena  had high courage.  She had told Jasper that she feared him &quot;in no  circumstances whatever.&quot;  Again, we have learned that in childhood she  had dressed as a boy when she ran away from home; and she had the  motives of protecting Rosa and her brother, Neville, from the  machinations of Jasper, who needs watching, as he is trying to ruin  Neville&#x27;s already dilapidated character, and, by spying on him, to  break down his nerve.  Really, of course, Neville is quite safe.   There is no CORPUS DELICTI, no carcase of the missing Edwin Drood.</p>
<p>For the reasons given, Datchery might be Helena in disguise.</p>
<p>If so, the idea is highly ludicrous, while nothing is proved either by  the blackness of Datchery&#x27;s eyebrows (Helena&#x27;s were black), or by  Datchery&#x27;s habit of carrying his hat under his arm, not on his head.   A person who goes so far as to wear a conspicuous white wig, would not  be afraid also to dye his eyebrows black, if he were Edwin; while  either Edwin or Helena MUST have &quot;made up&quot; the face, by the use of  paint and sham wrinkles.  Either Helena or Edwin would have been  detected in real life, of course, but we allow for the accepted  fictitious convention of successful disguise, and for the necessities  of the novelist.  A tightly buttoned surtout would show Helena&#x27;s  feminine figure; but let that also pass.  As to the hat, Edwin&#x27;s own  hair was long and thick:  add a wig, and his hat would be a burden to  him.</p>
<p>What is most unlike the stern, fierce, sententious Helena, is  Datchery&#x27;s habit of &quot;chaffing.&quot;  He fools the ass of a Mayor, Sapsea,  by most exaggerated diference:  his tone is always that of indolent  mockery, which one doubts whether the &quot;intense&quot; and concentrated  Helena could assume.  He takes rooms in the same house as Jasper, to  whom, as to Durdles and Deputy, he introduces himself on the night of  his arrival at Cloisterham.  He afterwards addresses Deputy, the  little GAMIN, by the name &quot;Winks,&quot; which is given to him by the people  at the Tramps&#x27; lodgings:  the name is a secret of Deputy&#x27;s.</p>
<p>JASPER, ROSA, AND TARTAR</p>
<p>Meanwhile Jasper formally proposes to Rosa, in the school garden:   standing apart and leaning against a sundial, as the garden is  commanded by many windows.  He offers to resign his hopes of bringing  Landless to the gallows (perhaps this bad man would provide a CORPUS  DELICTI of his own making!) if Rosa will accept him:  he threatens to  &quot;pursue her to the death,&quot; if she will not; he frightens her so  thoroughly that she rushes to Grewgious in his chambers in London.   She now suspects Jasper of Edwin&#x27;s murder, but keeps her thoughts to  herself.  She tells Grewgious, who is watching Neville, - &quot;I have a  fancy for keeping him under my eye,&quot; - that Jasper has made love to  her, and Grewgious replies in a parody of &quot;God save the King&quot;!</p>
<p>&quot;On Thee his hopes to fix Damn him again!&quot;</p>
<p>Would he fool thus, if he knew Jasper to have killed Edwin?  He is not  certain whether Rosa should visit Helena next day, in Landless&#x27;s  rooms, opposite; and Mr. Walters suggests that he may be aware that  Helena, dressed as Datchery, is really absent at Cloisterham.   However, next day, Helena is in her brother&#x27;s rooms.  Moreover, it is  really a sufficient explanation of Grewgious&#x27;s doubt that Jasper is  lurking around, and that not till next day is a PRIVATE way of  communication arranged between Neville and his friends.  In any case,  next day, Helena is in her brother&#x27;s rooms, and, by aid of a Mr.  Tartar&#x27;s rooms, she and Rosa can meet privately.  There is a good deal  of conspiring to watch Jasper when he watches Neville, and in this new  friend, Mr. Tartar, a lover is provided for Rosa.  Tartar is a  miraculously agile climber over roofs and up walls, a retired  Lieutenant of the navy, and a handy man, being such a climber, to  chase Jasper about the roof of the Cathedral, when Jasper&#x27;s day of  doom arrives.</p>
<p>JASPER&#x27;S OPIUM VISIONS</p>
<p>In July, Jasper revisits the London opium den, and talks under opium,  watched by the old hag.  He speaks of a thing which he often does in  visions:  &quot;a hazardous and perilous journey, over abysses where a slip  would be destruction.  Look down, look down!  You see what lies at the  bottom there?&quot;  He enacts the vision and says, &quot;There was a fellow  traveller.&quot;  He &quot;speaks in a whisper, and as if in the dark.&quot;  The  vision is, in this case, &quot;a poor vision:  no struggle, no  consciousness of peril, no entreaty.&quot;  Edwin, in the reminiscent  vision, dies very easily and rapidly.  &quot;When it comes to be real at  last, it is so short that it seems unreal for the first time.&quot;  &quot;And  yet I never saw THAT before.  Look what a poor miserable mean thing it  is.  THAT must be real.  It&#x27;s over.&quot;</p>
<p>What can all this mean?  We have been told that, shortly before  Christmas Eve, Jasper took to wearing a thick black-silk handkerchief  for his throat.  He hung it over his arm, &quot;his face knitted and  stern,&quot; as he entered his house for his Christmas Eve dinner.  If he  strangled Edwin with the scarf, as we are to suppose, he did not lead  him, drugged, to the tower top, and pitch him off.  Is part of  Jasper&#x27;s vision reminiscent - the brief, unresisting death - while  another part is a separate vision, is PROSPECTIVE, &quot;premonitory&quot;?   Does he see himself pitching Neville Landless off the tower top, or  see him fallen from the Cathedral roof?  Is Neville&#x27;s body &quot;THAT&quot; - &quot;I  never saw THAT before.  Look what a poor miserable mean thing it is!   THAT must be real.&quot;  Jasper &quot;never saw THAT&quot; - the dead body below the  height - before.  THIS vision, I think, is of the future, not of the  past, and is meant to bewilder the reader who thinks that the whole  represents the slaying of Drood.  The tale is rich in &quot;warnings&quot; and  telepathy.</p>
<p>DATCHERY AND THE OPIUM WOMAN</p>
<p>The hag now tracks Jasper home to Cloisterham.  Here she meets  Datchery, whom she asks how she can see Jasper?  If Datchery is Drood,  he now learns, WHAT HE DID NOT KNOW BEFORE, THAT THERE IS SOME  CONNECTION BETWEEN JASPER AND THE HAG.  He walks with her to the place  where Edwin met the hag, on Christmas Eve, and gave her money; and he  jingles his own money as he walks.  The place, or the sound of the  money, makes the woman tell Datchery about Edwin&#x27;s gift of three  shillings and sixpence for opium.  Datchery, &quot;with a sudden change of  countenance, gives her a sudden look.&quot;  It does not follow that he is  NOT Drood, for, though the hag&#x27;s love of opium was known to Drood,  Datchery is not to reveal his recognition of the woman.  He does what  any stranger would do; he &quot;gives a sudden look,&quot; as if surprised by  the mention of opium.</p>
<p>Mr. Walters says, &quot;Drood would not have changed countenance on hearing  a fact he had known six months previously.&quot;  But if Drood was playing  at being somebody else, he would, of course, give a kind of start and  stare, on hearing of the opium.  When he also hears from the hag that  her former benefactor&#x27;s name was Edwin, he asks her how she knew that  - &quot;a fatuously unnecessary question,&quot; says Mr. Walters.  A needless  question for Datchery&#x27;s information, if he be Drood, but as useful a  question as another if Drood be Datchery, and wishes to maintain the  conversation.</p>
<p>DATCHERY&#x27;S SCORE</p>
<p>Datchery keeps a tavern score of his discoveries behind a door, in  cryptic chalk strokes.  He does this, says Mr. Walters, because, being  Helena, he would betray himself if he wrote in a female hand.  But  nobody would WRITE secrets on a door!  He adds &quot;a moderate stroke,&quot;  after meeting the hag, though, says Mr. Walters, &quot;Edwin Drood would  have learned nothing new whatever&quot; from the hag.</p>
<p>But Edwin would have learned something quite new, and very important -  that the hag was hunting Jasper.  Next day Datchery sees the woman  shake her fists at Jasper in church, and hears from her that she knows  Jasper &quot;better far than all the reverend parsons put together know  him.&quot;  Datchery then adds a long thick line to his chalked score, yet,  says Mr. Walters, Datchery has learned &quot;nothing new to Edwin Drood, if  alive.&quot;</p>
<p>This is an obvious error.  It is absolutely new to Edwin Drood that  the opium hag is intimately acquainted with his uncle, Jasper, and  hates Jasper with a deadly hatred.  All this is not only new to Drood,  if alive, but is rich in promise of further revelations.  Drood, on  Christmas Eve, had learned from the hag only that she took opium, and  that she had come from town to Cloisterham, and had &quot;hunted for a  needle in a bottle of hay.&quot;  That was the sum of his information.  Now  he learns that the woman knows, tracks, has found, and hates, his  worthy uncle, Jasper.  He may well, therefore, add a heavy mark to his  score.</p>
<p>We must also ask, How could Helena, fresh from Ceylon, know &quot;the old  tavern way of keeping scores?  Illegible except to the scorer.  The  scorer not committed, the scored debited with what is against him,&quot; as  Datchery observes.  An Eurasian girl of twenty, new to England, would  not argue thus with herself:  she would probably know nothing of  English tavern scores.  We do not hear that Helena ever opened a book:   we do know that education had been denied to her.  What acquaintance  could she have with old English tavern customs?</p>
<p>If Drood is Datchery, then Dickens used a form of a very old and  favourite FICELLE of his:  the watching of a villain by an improbable  and unsuspected person, in this case thought to be dead.  If Helena is  Datchery, the &quot;assumption&quot; or personation is in the highest degree  improbable, her whole bearing is quite out of her possibilities, and  the personation is very absurd.</p>
<p>Here the story ends.</p>
<p>THEORIES OF THE MYSTERY</p>
<p>FORSTER&#x27;S EVIDENCE</p>
<p>WE have some external evidence as to Dickens&#x27;s solution of his own  problem, from Forster. (2)  On August 6, 1869, some weeks before he  began to work at his tale, Dickens, in a letter, told Forster, &quot;I have  a very curious and new idea for my new story.  Not communicable (or  the interest of the book would be gone), but a very strong one, though  difficult to work.&quot;  Forster must have instantly asked that the  incommunicable secret should be communicated to HIM, for he tells us  that &quot;IMMEDIATELY AFTER I learnt&quot; - the secret.  But did he learn it?   Dickens was ill, and his plot, whatever it may have been, would be  irritatingly criticized by Forster before it was fully thought out.   &quot;Fules and bairns should not see half-done work,&quot; and Dickens may well  have felt that Forster should not see work not even begun, but merely  simmering in the author&#x27;s own fancy.</p>
<p>Forster does not tell us that Dickens communicated the secret in a  letter.  He quotes none:  he says &quot;I was told,&quot; orally, that is.  When  he writes, five years later (1874), &quot;Landless was, I THINK, to have  perished in assisting Tartar finally to unmask and seize the  murderer,&quot; he is clearly trusting, not to a letter of Dickens&#x27;s, but  to a defective memory; and he knows it.  He says that a nephew was to  be murdered by an uncle.  The criminal was to confess in the condemned  cell.  He was to find out that his crime had been needless, and to be  convicted by means of the ring (Rosa&#x27;s mother&#x27;s ring) remaining in the  quicklime that had destroyed the body of Edwin.</p>
<p>Nothing &quot;new&quot; in all this, as Forster must have seen.  &quot;The  originality,&quot; he explains, &quot;was to consist in the review of the  murderer&#x27;s career by himself at the close, when its temptations were  to be dwelt upon as if, not he the culprit, but some other man, were  the tempted.&quot;</p>
<p>But all this is not &quot;hard to work,&quot; and is not &quot;original.&quot;  As Mr.  Proctor remarks, Dickens had used that trick twice already.   (&quot;Madman&#x27;s Manuscript,&quot; PICKWICK; &quot;Clock Case Confession,&quot; in MASTER  HUMPHREY&#x27;S CLOCK.)  The quicklime trick is also very old indeed.  The  disguise of a woman as a man is as ancient as the art of fiction:  yet  Helena MAY be Datchery, though nobody guessed it before Mr. Cuming  Walters.  She ought not to be Datchery; she is quite out of keeping in  her speech and manner as Datchery, and is much more like Drood.</p>
<p>&quot;A NEW IDEA&quot;</p>
<p>There are no new ideas in plots.  &quot;All the stories have been told,&quot;  and all the merit lies in the manner of the telling.  Dickens had used  the unsuspected watcher, as Mr. Proctor shows, in almost all his  novels.  In MARTIN CHUZZLEWIT, when Jonas finds that Nadgett has been  the watcher, Dickens writes, &quot;The dead man might have come out of his  grave and not confounded and appalled him so.&quot;  Now, to Jasper, Edwin  WAS &quot;the dead man,&quot; and Edwin&#x27;s grave contained quicklime.  Jasper was  sure that he had done for Edwin:  he had taken Edwin&#x27;s watch, chain,  and scarf-pin; he believed that he had left him, drugged, in  quicklime, in a locked vault.  Consequently the reappearance of Edwin,  quite well, in the vault where Jasper had buried him, would be a very  new idea to Jasper; would &quot;confound and appall him.&quot;  Jasper would  have emotions, at that spectacle, and so would the reader!  It is not  every day, even in our age of sixpenny novels, that a murderer is  compelled to visit, alone, at night, the vault which holds his  victim&#x27;s &quot;cold remains,&quot; and therein finds the victim &quot;come up,  smiling.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, for business purposes, this idea was new enough!  The idea was  &quot;difficult to work,&quot; says Dickens, with obvious truth.  How was he to  get the quicklime into the vault, and Drood, alive, out of the vault?   As to the reader, he would at first take Datchery for Drood, and then  think, &quot;No, that is impossible, and also is stale.  Datchery cannot be  Drood,&quot; and thus the reader would remain in a pleasant state of  puzzledom, as he does, unto this day.</p>
<p>If Edwin is dead, there is not much &quot;Mystery&quot; about him.  We have as  good as seen Jasper strangle him and take his pin, chain, and watch.   Yet by adroitly managing the conduct of Mr. Grewgious, Dickens  persuaded Mr. Proctor that certainly, Grewgious knew Edwin to be  alive.  As Grewgious knew, from Helena, all that was necessary to  provoke his experiment on Jasper&#x27;s nerves, Mr. Proctor argued on false  premises, but that was due to the craft of Dickens.  Mr. Proctor  rejected Forster&#x27;s report, from memory, of what he understood to be  the &quot;incommunicable secret&quot; of Dickens&#x27;s plot, and I think that he was  justified in the rejection.  Forster does not seem to have cared about  the thing - he refers lightly to &quot;the reader curious in such matters&quot;  - when once he had received his explanation from Dickens.  His memory,  in the space of five years, may have been inaccurate:  he probably  neither knew nor cared who Datchery was; and he may readily have  misunderstood what Dickens told him, orally, about the ring, as the  instrument of detection.  Moreover, Forster quite overlooked one  source of evidence, as I shall show later.</p>
<p>MR. PROCTOR&#x27;S THEORY</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor&#x27;s theory of the story is that Jasper, after Edwin&#x27;s return  at midnight on Christmas Eve, recommended a warm drink - mulled wine,  drugged - and then proposed another stroll of inspection of the  effects of the storm.  He then strangled him, somewhere, and placed  him in the quicklime in the Sapsea vault, locked him in, and went to  bed.  Next, according to Mr. Proctor, Durdles, then, &quot;lying drunk in  the precincts,&quot; for some reason taps with his hammer on the wall of  the Sapsea vault, detects the presence of a foreign body, opens the  tomb, and finds Drood in the quicklime, &quot;his face fortunately  protected by the strong silk shawl with which Jasper has intended to  throttle him.&quot;</p>
<p>A MISTAKEN THEORY</p>
<p>This is &quot;thin,&quot; very &quot;thin!&quot;  Dickens must have had some better scheme  than Mr. Proctor&#x27;s.  Why did Jasper not &quot;mak sikker&quot; like Kirkpatrick  with the Red Comyn?  Why did he leave his silk scarf?  It might come  to be asked for; to be sure the quicklime would destroy it, but why  did Jasper leave it?  Why did the intoxicated Durdles come out of the  crypt, if he was there, enter the graveyard, and begin tapping at the  wall of the vault?  Why not open the door? he had the key.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, all this to have occurred, and suppose, with Mr.  Proctor, that Durdles and Deputy carried Edwin to the Tramps&#x27;  lodgings, would Durdles fail to recognize Edwin?  We are to guess that  Grewgious was present, or disturbed at his inn, or somehow brought  into touch with Edwin, and bribed Durdles to silence, &quot;until a scheme  for the punishment of Jasper had been devised.&quot;</p>
<p>All this set of conjectures is crude to the last degree.  We do not  know how Dickens meant to get Edwin into and out of the vault.   Granting that Edwin was drugged, Jasper might lead Edwin in,  considering the licence extended to the effects of drugs in novels,  and might strangle him there.  Above all, how did Grewgious, if in  Cloisterham, come to be at hand at midnight?</p>
<p>ANOTHER WAY</p>
<p>If I must make a guess, I conjecture that Jasper had one of his  &quot;filmy&quot; seizures, was &quot;in a frightful sort of dream,&quot; and bungled the  murder:  made an incomplete job of it.  Half-strangled men and women  have often recovered.  In Jasper&#x27;s opium vision and reminiscence there  was no resistance, all was very soon over.  Jasper might even bungle  the locking of the door of the vault.  He was apt to have a seizure  after opium, in moments of excitement, and HE HAD BEEN AT THE OPIUM  DEN THROUGH THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 23, for the hag tracked him from her  house in town to Cloisterham on December 24, the day of the crime.   Grant that his accustomed fit came upon him during the excitement of  the murder, as it does come after &quot;a nicht wi&#x27; opium,&quot; in chapter ii.,  when Edwin excites him by contemptuous talk of the girl whom Jasper  loves so furiously - and then anything may happen!</p>
<p>Jasper murders Edwin inefficiently; he has a fit; while he is  unconscious the quicklime revives Edwin, by burning his hand, say,  and, during Jasper&#x27;s swoon, Edwin, like another famous prisoner, &quot;has  a happy thought, he opens the door, and walks out.&quot;</p>
<p>Being drugged, he is in a dreamy state; knows not clearly what has  occurred, or who attacked him.  Jasper revives, &quot;look on&#x27;t again he  dare not,&quot; - on the body of his victim - and HE walks out and goes  home, where his red lamp has burned all the time - &quot;thinking it all  wery capital.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another way,&quot; - Jasper not only fails to strangle Drood, but fails to  lock the door of the vault, and Drood walks out after Jasper has gone.   Jasper has, before his fit, &quot;removed from the body the most lasting,  the best known, and most easily recognizable things upon it, the watch  and scarf-pin.&quot;  So Dickens puts the popular view of the case against  Neville Landless, and so we are to presume that Jasper acted.  If he  removed no more things from the body than these, he made a fatal  oversight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, how does Edwin, once out of the vault, make good a secret  escape from Cloisterham?  Mr. Proctor invokes the aid of Mr.  Grewgious, but does not explain why Grewgious was on the spot.  I  venture to think it not inconceivable that Mr. Grewgious having come  down to Cloisterham by a late train, on Christmas Eve, to keep his  Christmas appointment with Rosa, paid a darkling visit to the tomb of  his lost love, Rosa&#x27;s mother.  Grewgious was very sentimental, but too  secretive to pay such a visit by daylight.  &quot;A night of memories and  sighs&quot; he might &quot;consecrate&quot; to his lost lady love, as Landor did to  Rose Aylmer.  Grewgious was to have helped Bazzard to eat a turkey on  Christmas Day.  But he could get out of that engagement.  He would  wish to see Edwin and Rosa together, and Edwin was leaving  Cloisterham.  The date of Grewgious&#x27;s arrival at Cloisterham is  studiously concealed.  I offer at least a conceivable motive for  Grewgious&#x27;s possible presence at the churchyard.  Mrs. Bud, his lost  love, we have been told, was buried hard by the Sapsea monument.  If  Grewgious visited her tomb, he was on the spot to help Edwin,  supposing Edwin to escape.  Unlikelier things occur in novels.  I do  not, in fact, call these probable occurrences in every-day life, but  none of the story is probable.  Jasper&#x27;s &quot;weird seizures&quot; are meant to  lead up to SOMETHING.  They may have been meant to lead up to the  failure of the murder and the escape of Edwin.  Of course Dickens  would not have treated these incidents, when he came to make Edwin  explain, - nobody else could explain, - in my studiously simple style.   The drugged Edwin himself would remember the circumstances but  mistily:  his evidence would be of no value against Jasper.</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor next supposes, we saw, that Drood got into touch with  Grewgious, and I have added the circumstances which might take  Grewgious to the churchyard.  Next, when Edwin recovered health, he  came down, perhaps, as Datchery, to spy on Jasper.  I have elsewhere  said, as Mr. Cuming Walters quotes me, that &quot;fancy can suggest no  reason why Edwin Drood, if he escaped from his wicked uncle, should go  spying about instead of coming openly forward.  No plausible  unfantastic reason could be invented.&quot;  Later, I shall explain why  Edwin, if he is Datchery, might go spying alone.</p>
<p>It is also urged that Edwin left Rosa in sorrow, and left blame on  Neville Landless.  Why do this?  Mr. Proctor replies that Grewgious&#x27;s  intense and watchful interest in Neville, otherwise unexplained, is  due to his knowledge that Drood is alive, and that Neville must be  cared for, while Grewgious has told Rosa that Edwin lives.  He also  told her of Edwin&#x27;s real love of her, hence Miss Bud says, &quot;Poor, poor  Eddy,&quot; quite A PROPOS DE BOTTES, when she finds herself many fathoms  deep in love with Lieutenant Tartar, R.N.  &quot;&#x27;Poor, poor Eddy!&#x27; thought  Rosa, as they walked along,&quot; Tartar and she.  This is a plausible  suggestion of Mr. Proctor.  Edwin, though known to Rosa to be alive,  has no chance!  But, as to my own remark, &quot;why should not Edwin come  forward at once, instead of spying about?&quot;  Well, if he did, there  would be no story.  As for &quot;an unfantastic reason&quot; for his conduct,  Dickens is not writing an &quot;unfantastic&quot; novel.  Moreover, if things  occurred as I have suggested, I do not see what evidence Drood had  against Jasper.  Edwin&#x27;s clothes were covered with lime, but, when he  told his story, Jasper would reply that Drood never returned to his  house on Christmas Eve, but stayed out, &quot;doing what was correct by the  season, in the way of giving it the welcome it had the right to  expect,&quot; like Durdles on another occasion.  Drood&#x27;s evidence, if it  was what I have suggested, would sound like the dream of an  intoxicated man, and what other evidence could be adduced?  Thus I had  worked out Drood&#x27;s condition, if he really was not killed, in this  way:  I had supposed him to escape, in a very mixed frame of mind,  when he would be encountered by Grewgious, who, of course, could make  little out of him in his befogged state.  Drood could not even prove  that it was not Landless who attacked him.  The result would be that  Drood would lie low, and later, would have reason enough for  disguising himself as Datchery, and playing the spy in Cloisterham.</p>
<p>At this point I was reinforced by an opinion which Mr. William Archer  had expressed, unknown to me, in a newspaper article.  I had described  Edwin&#x27;s confused knowledge of his own experience, if he were  thoroughly drugged, and then half strangled.  Mr. Archer also took  that point, and added that Edwin being a good-hearted fellow, and fond  of his uncle Jasper, he would not bring, or let Grewgious bring, a  terrible charge against Jasper, till he knew more certainly the whole  state of the case.  For that reason, he would come disguised to  Cloisterham and make inquiries.  By letting Jasper know about the  ring, he would compel him to enter the vault, and then, Mr. Archer  thinks, would induce him to &quot;repent and begin life afresh.&quot;</p>
<p>I scarcely think that Datchery&#x27;s purpose was so truly honourable:  he  rather seems to be getting up a case against Jasper.  Still, the idea  of Mr. Archer is very plausible, and, at least, given Drood&#x27;s need of  evidence, and the lack of evidence against Jasper, we see reason good,  in a novel of this kind, for his playing the part of amateur  detective.</p>
<p>DICKENS&#x27;S UNUSED DRAFT OF A CHAPTER</p>
<p>Forster found, and published, a very illegible sketch of a chapter of  the tale:  &quot;How Mr. Sapsea ceased to be a Member of the Eight Club,  Told by Himself.&quot;  This was &quot;a cramped, interlined, and blotted&quot;  draft, on paper of only half the size commonly used by Dickens.  Mr.  Sapsea tells how his Club mocked him about a stranger, who had  mistaken him for the Dean.  The jackass, Sapsea, left the Club, and  met the stranger, A YOUNG MAN, who fooled him to the top of his bent,  saying, &quot;If I was to deny that I came to this town to see and hear  you, Sir, what would it avail me?&quot;  Apparently this paper was a rough  draft of an idea for introducing a detective, as a YOUNG man, who  mocks Sapsea just as Datchery does in the novel.  But to make the spy  A YOUNG man, whether the spy was Drood or Helena Landless, was too  difficult; and therefore Dickens makes Datchery &quot;an elderly buffer&quot; in  a white wig.  If I am right, it was easier for Helena, a girl, to pose  as a young man, than for Drood to reappear as a young man, not  himself.  Helena MAY be Datchery, and yet Drood may be alive and  biding his time; but I have disproved my old objection that there was  no reason why Drood, if alive, should go spying about in disguise.   There were good Dickensian reasons.</p>
<p>A QUESTION OF TASTE</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters argues that the story is very tame if Edwin is  still alive, and left out of the marriages at the close.  Besides,  &quot;Drood is little more than a name-label, attached to a body, a man who  never excites sympathy, whose fate causes no emotion, he is saved for  no useful or sentimental purpose, and lags superfluous on the stage.   All of which is bad art, so bad that Dickens would never have been  guilty of it.&quot;</p>
<p>That is a question of taste.  On rereading the novel, I see that  Dickens makes Drood as sympathetic as he can.  He is very young, and  speaks of Rosa with bad taste, but he is really in love with her, much  more so than she with him, and he is piqued by her ceaseless mockery,  and by their false position.  To Jasper he is singularly tender, and  remorseful when he thinks that he has shown want of tact.  There is  nothing ominous about his gaiety:  as to his one fault, we leave him,  on Christmas Eve, a converted character:  he has a kind word and look  for every one whom he meets, young and old.  He accepts Mr.  Grewgious&#x27;s very stern lecture in the best manner possible.  In short,  he is marked as faulty -  &quot;I am young,&quot; so he excuses himself, in the  very words of Darnley to Queen Mary! (if the Glasgow letter be  genuine); but he is also marked as sympathetic.</p>
<p>He was, I think, to have a lesson, and to become a good fellow.  Mr.  Proctor rightly argues (and Forster &quot;thinks&quot;), that Dickens meant to  kill Neville Landless:  Mr. Cuming Walters agrees with him, but Mr.  Proctor truly adds that Edwin has none of the signs of Dickens&#x27;s  doomed men, his Sidney Cartons, and the rest.  You can tell, as it  were by the sound of the voice of Dickens, says Mr. Proctor, that  Edwin is to live.  The impression is merely subjective, but I feel the  impression.  The doom of Landless is conspicuously fixed, and why is  Landless to be killed by Jasper?  Merely to have a count on which to  hang Jasper!  He cannot be hanged for killing Drood, if Drood is  alive.</p>
<p>MR. PROCTOR&#x27;S THEORY CONTINUED</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor next supposes that Datchery and others, by aid of the  opium hag, have found out a great deal of evidence against Jasper.   They have discovered from the old woman that his crime was long  premeditated:  he had threatened &quot;Ned&quot; in his opiated dreams:  and had  clearly removed Edwin&#x27;s trinkets and watch, because they would not be  destroyed, with his body, by the quicklime.  This is all very well,  but there is still, so far, no legal evidence, on my theory, that  Jasper attempted to take Edwin&#x27;s life.  Jasper&#x27;s enemies, therefore,  can only do their best to make his life a burden to him, and to give  him a good fright, probably with the hope of terrifying him into  avowals.</p>
<p>Now the famous ring begins &quot;to drag and hold&quot; the murderer.  He is  given to know, I presume, that, when Edwin disappeared, he had a gold  ring in the pocket of his coat.  Jasper is thus compelled to revisit  the vault, at night, and there, in the light of his lantern, he sees  the long-lost Edwin, with his hand in the breast of his great coat.</p>
<p>Horrified by this unexpected appearance, Jasper turns to fly.  But he  is confronted by Neville Landless, Crisparkle, Tartar, and perhaps by  Mr. Grewgious, who are all on the watch.  He rushes up through the  only outlet, the winding staircase of the Cathedral tower, of which we  know that he has had the key.  Neville, who leads his pursuers,  &quot;receives his death wound&quot; (and, I think, is pitched off the top of  the roof).  Then Jasper is collared by that agile climber, Tartar, and  by Crisparkle, always in the pink of condition.  There is now  something to hang Jasper for - the slaying of Landless (though, as far  as I can see, THAT was done in self-defence).  Jasper confesses all;  Tartar marries Rosa; Helena marries Crisparkle.  Edwin is only twenty- one, and may easily find a consoler of the fair sex:  indeed he is  &quot;ower young to marry yet.&quot;</p>
<p>The capture of Jasper was fixed, of course, for Christmas Eve.  The  phantom cry foreheard by Durdles, two years before, was that of  Neville as he fell; and the dog that howled was Neville&#x27;s dog, a  character not yet introduced into the romance.</p>
<p>MR. CUMING WALTERS&#x27;S THEORY</p>
<p>Such is Mr. Proctor&#x27;s theory of the story, in which I mainly agree.   Mr. Proctor relies on a piece of evidence overlooked by Forster, and  certainly misinterpreted, as I think I can prove to a certainty, by  Mr. Cuming Walters, whose theory of the real conduct of the plot runs  thus:  After watching the storm at midnight with Edwin, Neville left  him, and went home:  &quot;his way lay in an opposite direction.  Near to  the Cathedral Jasper intercepted his nephew. . . . Edwin may have been  already drugged.&quot;  How the murder was worked Mr. Cuming Walters does  not say, but he introduces at this point, the two sounds foreheard by  Durdles, without explaining &quot;the howl of a dog.&quot;  Durdles would hear  the cries, and Deputy &quot;had seen what he could not understand,&quot;  whatever it was that he saw.  Jasper, not aware of Drood&#x27;s possession  of the ring, takes only his watch, chain, and pin, which he places on  the timbers of the weir, and in the river, to be picked up by that  persistent winter-bather, Crisparkle of the telescopic and microscopic  eyesight.</p>
<p>As to the ring, Mr. Cuming Walters erroneously declares that Mr.  Proctor &quot;ignores&quot; the power of the ring &quot;to hold and drag,&quot; and says  that potent passage is &quot;without meaning and must be disregarded.&quot;   Proctor, in fact, gives more than three pages to the meaning of the  ring, which &quot;drags&quot; Jasper into the vault, when he hears of its  existence. (3)  Next, Mr. Cuming Walters supposes Datchery to learn  from Durdles, whom he is to visit, about the second hearing of the cry  and the dog&#x27;s howl.  Deputy may have seen Jasper &quot;carrying his burden&quot;  (Edwin) &quot;towards the Sapsea vault.&quot;  In fact, Jasper probably saved  trouble by making the drugged Edwin walk into that receptacle.   &quot;Datchery would not think of the Sapsea vault unaided.&quot;  No - unless  Datchery was Drood !  &quot;Now Durdles is useful again.  Tapping with his  hammer he would find a change . . . inquiry must be made.&quot;  Why should  Durdles tap the Sapsea monument?  As Durdles had the key, he would  simply walk into the vault, and find the quicklime.  Now, Jasper also,  we presume, had a key, made from a wax impression of the original.  If  he had any sense, he would have removed the quicklime as easily as he  inserted it, for Mr. Sapsea was mortal:  he might die any day, and be  buried, and then the quicklime, lying where it ought not, would give  rise to awkward inquiries.</p>
<p>Inquiry being made, in consequence of Durdles&#x27;s tappings, the ring  would be found, as Mr. Cuming Walters says.  But even then, unless  Deputy actually saw Jasper carry a man into the vault, nobody could  prove Jasper&#x27;s connection with the presence of the ring in the vault.   Moreover, Deputy hated Jasper, and if he saw Jasper carrying the body  of a man, on the night when a man disappeared, he was clever enough to  lead Durdles to examine the vault, AT ONCE.  Deputy had a great  dislike of the Law and its officers, but here was a chance for him to  distinguish himself, and conciliate them.</p>
<p>However these things may be, Mr. Cuming Walters supposes that Jasper,  finding himself watched, re-enters the vault, perhaps, &quot;to see that  every trace of the crime had been removed.&quot;  In the vault he finds -  Datchery, that is, Helena Landless!  Jasper certainly visited the  vault and found somebody.</p>
<p>EVIDENCE OF COLLINS&#x27;S DRAWINGS</p>
<p>We now come to the evidence which Forster strangely overlooked, which  Mr. Proctor and Mr. Archer correctly deciphered, and which Mr. Cuming  Walters misinterprets.  On December 22, 1869, Dickens wrote to Forster  that two numbers of his romance were &quot;now in type.  Charles Collins  has designed an excellent cover.&quot;  Mr. C. A. Collins had married a  daughter of Dickens. (4)  He was an artist, a great friend of Dickens,  and author of that charming book, &quot;A Cruise on Wheels.&quot;  His design of  the paper cover of the story (it appeared in monthly numbers)  contained, as usual, sketches which give an inkling of the events in  the tale.  Mr. Collins was to have illustrated the book; but, finally,  Mr. (now Sir) Luke Fildes undertook the task.  Mr. Collins died in  1873.  It appears that Forster never asked him the meaning of his  designs - a singular oversight.</p>
<p>The cover lies before the reader.  In the left-hand top corner appears  an allegorical female figure of joy, with flowers.  The central top  space contains the front of Cloisterham Cathedral, or rather, the  nave.  To the left walks Edwin, with hyacinthine locks, and a  thoroughly classical type of face, and Grecian nose.  LIKE DATCHERY,  HE DOES NOT WEAR, BUT CARRIES HIS HAT; this means nothing, if they are  in the nave.  He seems bored.  On his arm is Rosa; SHE seems bored;  she trails her parasol, and looks away from Edwin, looks down, to her  right.  On the spectator&#x27;s right march the surpliced men and boys of  the Choir.  Behind them is Jasper, black whiskers and all; he stares  after Edwin and Rosa; his right hand hides his mouth.  In the corner  above him is an allegorical female,  clasping a stiletto.</p>
<p>Beneath Edwin and Rosa is, first, an allegorical female figure,  looking at a placard, headed &quot;LOST,&quot; on a door.  Under that, again, is  a girl in a garden-chair; a young man, whiskerless, with wavy hair,  kneels and kisses her hand.  She looks rather unimpassioned.  I  conceive the man to be Landless, taking leave of Rosa after urging his  hopeless suit, for which Helena, we learn, &quot;seems to compassionate  him.&quot;  He has avowed his passion, early in the story, to Crisparkle.   Below, the opium hag is smoking.  On the other side, under the figures  of Jasper and the Choir, the young man who kneels to the girl is seen  bounding up a spiral staircase.  His left hand is on the iron railing;  he stoops over it, looking down at others who follow him.  His right  hand, the index finger protruded, points upward, and, by chance or  design, points straight at Jasper in the vignette above.  Beneath this  man (clearly Landless) follows a tall man in a &quot;bowler&quot; hat, a &quot;cut- away&quot; coat, and trousers which show an inch of white stocking above  the low shoes.  His profile is hid by the wall of the spiral  staircase:  he might be Grewgious of the shoes, white stockings, and  short trousers, but he may be Tartar:  he takes two steps at a stride.   Beneath him a youngish man, in a low, soft, clerical hat and a black  pea-coat, ascends, looking downwards and backwards.  This is clearly  Crisparkle.  A Chinaman is smoking opium beneath.</p>
<p>In the central lowest space, a dark and whiskered man enters a dark  chamber; his left hand is on the lock of the door; in his right he  holds up a lantern.  The light of the lantern reveals a young man in a  soft hat of Tyrolese shape.  His features are purely classical, his  nose is Grecian, his locks are long (at least, according to the taste  of to-day); he wears a light paletot, buttoned to the throat; his  right arm hangs by his side; his left hand is thrust into the breast  of his coat.  He calmly regards the dark man with the lantern.  That  man, of course, is Jasper.  The young man is EDWIN DROOD, of the  Grecian nose, hyacinthine locks, and classic features, as in Sir L.  Fildes&#x27;s third illustration.</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor correctly understood the unmistakable meaning of this last  design, Jasper entering the vault -</p>
<p>&quot;TO-DAY THE DEAD ARE LIVING, THE LOST IS FOUND TO-DAY.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters tells us that he did not examine these designs by  Mr. Collins till he had formed his theory, and finished his book.  &quot;On  the conclusion of the whole work the pictures were referred to for the  first time, and were then found to support in the most striking manner  the opinions arrived at,&quot; namely, that Drood was killed, and that  Helena is Datchery.  Thus does theory blind us to facts!</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters connects the figure of the whiskerless young man  kneeling to a girl in a garden seat, with the whiskered Jasper&#x27;s  proposal to Rosa in a garden seat.  But Jasper does not kneel to Rosa;  he stands apart, leaning on a sundial; he only once vaguely &quot;touches&quot;  her, which she resents; he does not kneel; he does not kiss her hand  (Rosa &quot;took the kiss sedately,&quot; like Maud in the poem); and - Jasper  had lustrous thick black whiskers.</p>
<p>Again, the same whiskerless young man, bounding up the spiral  staircase in daylight, and wildly pointing upwards, is taken by Mr.  Cuming Walters to represent Jasper climbing the staircase to  reconnoitre, at night, with a lantern, and, of course, with black  whiskers.  The two well-dressed men on the stairs (Grewgious, or  Tartar, and Crisparkle) also, according to Mr. Cuming Walters, &quot;relate  to Jasper&#x27;s unaccountable expedition with Durdles to the Cathedral.&quot;   Neither of them is Jasper; neither of them is Durdles, &quot;in a suit of  coarse flannel&quot; - a disreputable jacket, as Sir L. Fildes depicts him  - &quot;with horn buttons,&quot; and a battered old tall hat.  These  interpretations are quite demonstrably erroneous and even impossible.   Mr. Archer interprets the designs exactly as I do.</p>
<p>As to the young man in the light of Jasper&#x27;s lamp, Mr. Cuming Walters  says, &quot;the large hat and the tightly-buttoned surtout must be  observed; they are the articles of clothing on which most stress is  laid in the description of Datchery.  But the face is young.&quot;  The  face of Datchery was elderly, and he had a huge shock of white hair, a  wig.  Datchery wore &quot;a tightish blue surtout, with a buff waist-coat  and grey trousers; he had something of a military air.&quot;  The young man  in the vault has anything but a military air; he shows no waistcoat,  and he does not wear &quot;a tightish blue surtout,&quot; or any surtout at all.</p>
<p>The surtout of the period is shown, worn by Jasper, in Sir L. Fildes&#x27;s  sixth and ninth illustrations.  It is a frock-coat; the collar  descends far below the top of the waistcoat (buff or otherwise),  displaying that garment; the coat is tightly buttoned beneath,  revealing the figure; the tails of the coat do not reach the knees of  the wearer.  The young man in the vault, on the other hand, wears a  loose paletot, buttoned to the throat (vaults are chilly places), and  the coat falls so as to cover the knees; at least, partially.  The  young man is not, like Helena, &quot;very dark, and fierce of look, . . .  of almost the gipsy type.&quot;  He is blonde, sedate, and of the classic  type, as Drood was.  He is no more like Helena than Crisparkle is like  Durdles.  Mr. Cuming Walters says that Mr. Proctor was &quot;unable to  allude to the prophetic picture by Collins.&quot;  As a fact, this picture  is fully described by Mr. Proctor, but Mr. Walters used the wrong  edition of his book, unwittingly.</p>
<p>Mr. Proctor writes:- &quot;Creeping down the crypt steps, oppressed by  growing horror and by terror of coming judgment, sickening under fears  engendered by the darkness of night and the charnel-house air he  breathed, Jasper opens the door of the tomb and holds up his lantern,  shuddering at the thought of what it may reveal to him.</p>
<p>&quot;And what sees he?  Is it the spirit of his victim that stands there,  &#x27;in his habit as he lived,&#x27; his hand clasped on his breast, where the  ring had been when he was murdered?  What else can Jasper deem it?   There, clearly visible in the gloom at the back of the tomb, stands  Edwin Drood, with stern look fixed on him - pale, silent, relentless!&quot;</p>
<p>Again, &quot;On the title-page are given two of the small pictures from the  Love side of the cover, two from the Murder side, and the central  picture below, which presents the central horror of the story - the  end and aim of the &#x27;Datchery assumption&#x27; and of Mr. Grewgious&#x27;s plans  - showing Jasper driven to seek for the proofs of his crime amid the  dust to which, as he thought, the flesh and bones, and the very  clothes of his victim, had been reduced.&quot;</p>
<p>There are only two possible choices; either Collins, under Dickens&#x27;s  oral instructions, depicted Jasper finding Drood alive in the vault,  an incident which was to occur in the story; or Dickens bade Collins  do this for the purpose of misleading his readers in an illegitimate  manner; while the young man in the vault was really to be some person  &quot;made up&quot; to look like Drood, and so to frighten Jasper with a pseudo- ghost of that hero.  The latter device, the misleading picture, would  be childish, and the pseudo-ghost, exactly like Drood, could not be  acted by the gipsy-like, fierce Helena, or by any other person in the  romance.</p>
<p>MR. WALTERS&#x27;S THEORY CONTINUED</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters guesses that Jasper was to aim a deadly blow (with  his left hand, to judge from the picture) at Helena, and that Neville  &quot;was to give his life for hers.&quot;  But, manifestly, Neville was to lead  the hunt of Jasper up the spiral stair, as in Collins&#x27;s design, and  was to be dashed from the roof:  his body beneath was to be &quot;THAT, I  never saw before.  THAT must be real.  Look what a poor mean miserable  thing it is!&quot; as Jasper says in his vision.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuming Walters, pursuing his idea of Helena as both Datchery and  also as the owner of &quot;the YOUNG face&quot; of the youth in the vault (and  also of the young hands, a young girl&#x27;s hands could never pass for  those of &quot;an elderly buffer&quot;), exclaims:  &quot;Imagine the intense power  of the dramatic climax, when Datchery, the elderly man, is re- transformed into Helena Landless, the young and handsome woman; and  when she reveals the seemingly impenetrable secret which had been  closed up in one guilty man&#x27;s mind.&quot;</p>
<p>The situations are startling, I admit, but how would Canon Crisparkle  like them?  He is, we know, to marry Helena, &quot;the young person, my  dear,&quot; Miss Twinkleton would say, &quot;who for months lived alone, at  inns, wearing a blue surtout, a buff waistcoat, and grey - &quot;  Here  horror chokes the utterance of Miss Twinkleton.  &quot;Then she was in the  vault in ANOTHER disguise, not more womanly, at that awful scene when  poor Mr. Jasper was driven mad, so that he confessed all sorts of  nonsense, for, my dear, all the Close believes that it WAS nonsense,  and that Mr. Jasper was reduced to insanity by persecution.  And Mr.  Crisparkle, with that elegant dainty mother of his - it has broken her  heart - is marrying this half-caste gipsy TROLLOP, with her blue  surtout and grey - oh, it is a disgrace to Cloisterham!&quot;</p>
<p>The climax, in fact, as devised by Mr. Cuming Walters, is rather too  dramatic for the comfort of a minor canon.  A humorist like Dickens  ought to have seen the absurdity of the situation.  Mr. Walters MAY be  right, Helena may be Datchery, but she ought not to be.</p>
<p>WHO WAS THE PRINCESS PUFFER?</p>
<p>Who was the opium hag, the Princess Puffer?  Mr. Cuming Walters  writes:  &quot;We make a guess, for Dickens gives us no solid facts.  But  when we remember that not a word is said throughout the volume of  Jasper&#x27;s antecedents, who he was, and where he came from; when we  remember that but for his nephew he was a lonely man; when we see that  he was both criminal and artist; when we observe his own wheedling  propensity, his false and fulsome protestations of affection, his  slyness, his subtlety, his heartlessness, his tenacity; and when,  above all, we know that the opium vice is HEREDITARY, and that a YOUNG  man would not be addicted to it unless born with the craving; (5)  then, it is not too wild a conjecture that Jasper was the wayward  progeny of this same opium-eating woman, all of whose characteristics  he possessed, and, perchance, of a man of criminal instincts, but of a  superior position.  Jasper is a morbid and diseased being while still  in the twenties, a mixture of genius and vice.  He hates and he loves  fiercely, as if there were wild gipsy blood in his veins.  Though  seemingly a model of decorum and devoted to his art, he complains of  his &quot;daily drudging round&quot; and &quot;the cramped monotony of his  existence.&quot;  He commits his crime with the ruthlessness of a beast,  his own nature being wholly untamed.  If we deduce that his father was  an adventurer and a vagabond, we shall not be far wrong.  If we deduce  that his mother was the opium-eater, prematurely aged, who had  transmitted her vicious propensity to her child, we shall almost  certainly be right.&quot;</p>
<p>WHO WAS JASPER?</p>
<p>Who was Jasper?  He was the brother-in-law of the late Mr. Drood, a  respected engineer, and University man.  We do not know whence came  Mrs. Drood, Jasper&#x27;s sister, but is it likely that her mother &quot;drank  heaven&#x27;s-hard&quot; - so the hag says of herself - then took to keeping an  opium den, and there entertained her son Jasper, already an  accomplished vocalist, but in a lower station than that to which his  musical genius later raised him, as lay Precentor?  If the Princess  Puffer be, as on Mr. Cuming Walters&#x27;s theory she is, Edwin&#x27;s long-lost  grandmother, her discovery would be unwelcome to Edwin.  Probably she  did not live much longer; &quot;my lungs are like cabbage nets,&quot; she says.   Mr. Cuming Walters goes on -</p>
<p>&quot;Her purpose is left obscure.  How easily, however, we see  possibilities in a direction such as this.  The father, perhaps a  proud, handsome man, deserts the woman, and removes the child.  The  woman hates both for scorning her, but the father dies, or disappears,  and is beyond her vengeance.  Then the child, victim to the ills in  his blood, creeps back to the opium den, not knowing his mother, but  immediately recognized by her.  She will make the child suffer for the  sins of the father, who had destroyed her happiness.  Such a theme was  one which appealed to Dickens.  It must not, however, be urged; and  the crucial question after all is concerned with the opium woman as  one of the unconscious instruments of justice, aiding with her trifle  of circumstantial evidence the Nemesis awaiting Jasper.</p>
<p>&quot;Another hypothesis - following on the Carker theme in &#x27;Dombey and  Son&#x27; - is that Jasper, a dissolute and degenerate man, lascivious, and  heartless, may have wronged a child of the woman&#x27;s; but it is not  likely that Dickens would repeat the Mrs. Brown story.&quot;</p>
<p>Jasper, PERE, father of John Jasper and of Mrs. Drood, however  handsome, ought not to have deserted Mrs. Jasper.  Whether John  Jasper, prematurely devoted to opium, became Edwin&#x27;s guardian at about  the age of fifteen, or whether, on attaining his majority, he  succeeded to some other guardian, is not very obvious.  In short, we  cannot guess why the Princess Puffer hated Jasper, a paying client of  long standing.  We are only certain that Jasper was a bad fellow, and  that the Princess Puffer said, &quot;I know him, better than all the  Reverend Parsons put together know him.&quot;  On the other hand, Edwin  &quot;seems to know&quot; the opium woman, when he meets her on Christmas Eve,  which may be a point in favour of her being his long-lost grandmother.</p>
<p>Jasper was certainly tried and condemned; for Dickens intended &quot;to  take Mr. Fildes to a condemned cell in Maidstone, or some other gaol,  in order to make a drawing.&quot; (6)  Possibly Jasper managed to take his  own life, in the cell; possibly he was duly hanged.</p>
<p>Jasper, after all, was a failure as a murderer, even if we suppose him  to have strangled his nephew successfully.  &quot;It is obvious to the most  excruciatingly feeble capacity&quot; that, if he meant to get rid of proofs  of the identity of Drood&#x27;s body by means of quicklime, it did not  suffice to remove Drood&#x27;s pin, watch, and chain.  Drood would have  coins of the realm in his pockets, gold, silver, bronze.  Quicklime  would not destroy these metallic objects, nor would it destroy keys,  which would easily prove Drood&#x27;s identity.  If Jasper knew his  business, he would, of course, rifle ALL of Edwin&#x27;s pockets minutely,  and would remove the metallic buttons of his braces, which generally  display the maker&#x27;s name, or the tailor&#x27;s.  On research I find &quot;H.  Poole &amp; Co., Savile Row&quot; on my buttons.  In this inquiry of his,  Jasper would have discovered the ring in Edwin&#x27;s breast pocket, and  would have taken it away.  Perhaps Dickens never thought of that  little fact:  if he did think of it, no doubt he found some mode of  accounting for Jasper&#x27;s unworkmanlike negligence.  The trouser-buttons  would have led any inquirer straight to Edwin&#x27;s tailor; I incline to  suspect that neither Dickens nor Jasper noticed that circumstance.   The conscientious artist in crime cannot afford to neglect the  humblest and most obvious details.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>ACCORDING to my theory, which mainly rests on the unmistakable  evidence of the cover drawn by Collins under Dickens&#x27;s directions, all  &quot;ends well.&quot;  Jasper comes to the grief he deserves:  Helena, after  her period of mourning for Neville, marries Crisparkle:  Rosa weds her  mariner.  Edwin, at twenty-one, is not heart-broken, but, a greatly  improved character, takes, to quote his own words, &quot;a sensible  interest in works of engineering skill, especially when they are to  change the whole condition of an undeveloped country&quot; - Egypt.</p>
<p>These conclusions are inevitable unless we either suppose Dickens to  have arranged a disappointment for his readers in the TABLEAU of  Jasper and Drood, in the vault, on the cover, or can persuade  ourselves that not Drood, but some other young man, is revealed by the  light of Jasper&#x27;s lantern.  Now, the young man is very like Drood, and  very unlike the dark fierce Helena Landless:  disguised as Drood, this  time, not as Datchery.  All the difficulty as to why Drood, if he  escaped alive, did not at once openly denounce Jasper, is removed when  we remember, as Mr. Archer and I have independently pointed out, that  Drood, when attacked by Jasper, was (like Durdles in the  &quot;unaccountable expedition&quot;) stupefied by drugs, and so had no valid  evidence against his uncle.  Whether science is acquainted with the  drugs necessary for such purposes is another question.  They are  always kept in stock by starving and venal apothecaries in fiction and  the drama, and are a recognized convention of romance.</p>
<p>So ends our unfolding of the Mystery of Edwin Drood.</p>
