While, as regards any historical accuracy in dress, Lord Lytton, in an article in the NINETEENTH CENTURY, has laid it down as a dogma of art that archaeology is entirely out of place in the presentation of any of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and the attempt to introduce it one of the stupidest pedantries of an age of prigs.  Lord Lytton&#x27;s position I shall examine later on; but, as regards the theory that Shakespeare did not busy himself much about the costume-wardrobe of his theatre, anybody who cares to study Shakespeare&#x27;s method will see that there is absolutely no dramatist of the French, English, or Athenian stage who relies so much for his illusionist effects on the dress of his actors as Shakespeare does himself.  Knowing how the artistic temperament is always fascinated by beauty of costume, he constantly introduces into his plays masques and dances, purely for the sake of the pleasure which they give the eye; and we have still his stage-directions for the three great processions in HENRY THE EIGHTH, directions which are characterised by the most extraordinary elaborateness of detail down to the collars of S.S. and the pearls in Anne Boleyn&#x27;s hair.  Indeed it would be quite easy for a modern manager to reproduce these pageants absolutely as Shakespeare had them designed; and so accurate were they that one of the court officials of the time, writing an account of the last performance of the play at the Globe Theatre to a friend, actually complains of their realistic character, notably of the production on the stage of the Knights of the Garter in the robes and insignia of the order as being calculated to bring ridicule on the real ceremonies; much in the same spirit in which the French Government, some time ago, prohibited that delightful actor, M. Christian, from appearing in uniform, on the plea that it was prejudicial to the glory of the army that a colonel should be caricatured.  And elsewhere the gorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the English stage under Shakespeare&#x27;s influence was attacked by the contemporary critics, not as a rule, however, on the grounds of the democratic tendencies of realism, but usually on those moral grounds which are always the last refuge of people who have no sense of beauty.  The point, however, which I wish to emphasise is, not that Shakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in adding picturesqueness to poetry, but that he saw how important costume is as a means of producing certain dramatic effects.  Many of his plays, such as MEASURE FOR MEASURE, TWELFTH NIGHT, THE TWO GENTLEMAN OF VERONA, ALL&#x27;S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, CYMBELINE, and others, depend for their illusion on the character of the various dresses worn by the hero or the heroine; the delightful scene in HENRY THE SIXTH, on the modern miracles of healing by faith, loses all its point unless Gloster is in black and scarlet; and the DENOUMENT of the MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR hinges on the colour of Anne Page&#x27;s gown.  As for the uses Shakespeare makes of disguises the instances are almost numberless.  Posthumus hides his passion under a peasant&#x27;s garb, and Edgar his pride beneath an idiot&#x27;s rags; Portia wears the apparel of a lawyer, and Rosalind is attired in &#x27;all points as a man&#x27;; the cloak-bag of Pisanio changes Imogen to the Youth Fidele; Jessica flees from her father&#x27;s house in boy&#x27;s dress, and Julia ties up her yellow hair in fantastic love-knots, and dons hose and doublet; Henry the Eighth woos his lady as a shepherd, and Romeo his as a pilgrim; Prince Hal and Poins appear first as footpads in buckram suits, and then in white aprons and leather jerkins as the waiters in a tavern-   I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. &#x27;Twas on a summer&#x27;s evening, in his tent, The day he overcame the Nervii See what a rent the envious Casca made-   Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse, Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armour that thou wear&#x27;st.   As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, it is to be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historical plays, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many effective open-air incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who had at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who could rely on the actors taking pains about their make-up.  Even now it is difficult to produce such a play as the COMEDY OF ERRORS; and to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry&#x27;s brother resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing TWELFTH NIGHT adequately performed.  Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare&#x27;s on the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a master of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing- master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production. For he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each character.  &#x27;Racine abhorre la realite,&#x27; says Auguste Vacquerie somewhere; &#x27;il ne daigne pas s&#x27;occuper de son costume.  Si l&#x27;on s&#x27;en rapportait aux indications du poete, Agamemnon serait vetu d&#x27;un sceptre et Achille d&#x27;une epee.&#x27;  But with Shakespeare it is very different.  He gives us directions about the costumes of Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in MACBETH, and the apothecary in ROMEO AND JULIET, several elaborate descriptions of his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in which Petruchio is to be married.  Rosalind, he tells us, is tall, and is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and is to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt.  The children who play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white and green - a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose favourite colours they were - and in white, with green garlands and gilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton. Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by his wearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his boots.  The Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in mourning beside her.  The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of the Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue.  We know the patterns on the Dauphin&#x27;s armour and the Pucelle&#x27;s sword, the crest on Warwick&#x27;s helmet and the colour of Bardolph&#x27;s nose.  Portia has golden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek&#x27;s hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and won&#x27;t curl at all.  Some of the characters are stout, some lean, some straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are to blacken their faces.  Lear has a white beard, Hamlet&#x27;s father a grizzled, and Benedick is to shave his in the course of the play. Indeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quite elaborate; tells us of the many different colours in use, and gives a hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on. There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics in hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians, and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in an ass&#x27;s head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated husband and his wife&#x27;s milliner about the slashing of a sleeve.  As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the aphorisms he makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age, particularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies&#x27; bonnets, and the many descriptions of the MUNDUS MULIEBRIS, from the long of Autolycus in the WINTER&#x27;S TALE down to the account of the Duchess of Milan&#x27;s gown in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, they are far too numerous to quote; though it may be worth while to remind people that the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to be found in Lear&#x27;s scene with Edgar - a passage which has the advantage of brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing metaphysics of SARTOR RESARTUS.  But I think that from what I have already said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much interested in costume.  I do not mean in that shallow sense by which it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds and daffodils that he was the Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan age; but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressive of a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain types of character, and is one of the essential factors of the means which a true illusionist has at his disposal.  Indeed to him the deformed figure of Richard was of as much value as Juliet&#x27;s loveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks of the lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each  and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one of his plays, expresses his regret at being unable to produce helmets of the period, he is speaking as an Elizabethan manager and not merely as an Elizabethan poet.  At Cambridge, for instance, during his day, a play of RICHARD THE THIRD was performed, in which the actors were attired in real dresses of the time, procured from the great collection of historical costume in the Tower, which was always open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes placed at their disposal.  And I cannot help thinking that this performance must have been far more artistic, as regards costume, than Garrick&#x27;s mounting of Shakespeare&#x27;s own play on the subject, in which he himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, and everybody else in the costume of the time of George the Third, Richmond especially being much admired in the uniform of a young guardsman.  For what is the use to the stage of that archaeology which has so strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can give us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which the action of the play passes?  It enables us to see a Greek dressed like a Greek, and an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the arcades of Venice and the balconies of Verona; and, if the play deals with any of the great eras in our country&#x27;s history, to contemplate the age in its proper attire, and the king in his habit as he lived.  And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would have said some time ago, at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, had the curtain risen on his father&#x27;s Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair, attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume which in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to an antique Roman!  For in those halcyon days of the drama no archaeology troubled the stage, or distressed the critics, and our inartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of anachronisms, and beheld with the calm complacency of the age of prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a Lear in lace ruffles, and a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline.  I can understand archaeology being attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but to attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark. However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as well speak disrespectfully of the equator.  For archaeology, being a science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply.  Its value depends entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it. We look to the archaeologist for the materials, to the artist for the method.  In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, the first thing the artist has to settle is the best date for the drama.  This should be determined by the general spirit of the play, more than by any actual historical references which may occur in it.  Most HAMLETS I have seen were placed far too early. HAMLET is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and if the allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts it back to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down much later.  Once, however, that the date has been fixed, then the archaeologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is to convert into effects.  It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show us that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a great deal of capital has been made out of Hector&#x27;s indiscreet quotation from Aristotle.  Upon the other hand, the anachronisms are really few in number, and not very important, and, had Shakespeare&#x27;s attention been drawn to them by a brother artist, he would probably have corrected them.  For, though they can hardly be called blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of his work; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannot be emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to its proper date.  In looking at Shakespeare&#x27;s plays as a whole, however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelity as regards his personages and his plots.  Many of his DRAMATIS PERSONAE are people who had actually existed, and some of them might have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience. Indeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his time was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.  As for his plots, Shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentic history, or from the old ballads and traditions which served as history to the Elizabethan public, and which even now no scientific historian would dismiss as absolutely untrue.  And not merely did he select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of his imaginative work, but he always gives to each play the general character, the social atmosphere in a word, of the age in question. Stupidity he recognises as being one of the permanent characteristics of all European civilisations; so he sees no difference between a London mob of his own day and a Roman mob of pagan days, between a silly watchman in Messina and a silly Justice of the Peace in Windsor.  But when he deals with higher characters, with those exceptions of each age which are so fine that they become its types, he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal of their time.  Virgilia is one of those Roman wives on whose tomb was written &#x27;Domi mansit, lanam fecit,&#x27; as surely as Juliet is the romantic girl of the Renaissance.  He is even true to the characteristics of race.  Hamlet has all the imagination and irresolution of the Northern nations, and the Princess Katharine is as entirely French as the heroine of DIVORCONS.  Harry the Fifth is a pure Englishman, and Othello a true Moor.  Again when Shakespeare treats of the history of England from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it is wonderful how careful he is to have his facts perfectly right - indeed he follows Holinshed with curious fidelity.  The incessant wars between France and England are described with extraordinary accuracy down to the names of the besieged towns, the ports of landing and embarkation, the sites and dates of the battles, the titles of the commanders on each side, and the lists of the killed and wounded.  And as regards the Civil Wars of the Roses we have many elaborate genealogies of the seven sons of Edward the Third; the claims of the rival Houses of York and Lancaster to the throne are discussed at length; and if the English aristocracy will not read Shakespeare as a poet, they should certainly read him as a sort of early Peerage.  There is hardly a single title in the Upper House, with the exception of course of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords, which does not appear in Shakespeare along with many details of family history, creditable and discreditable.  Indeed if it be really necessary that the School Board children should know all about the Wars of the Roses, they could learn their lessons just as well out of Shakespeare as out of shilling primers, and learn them, I need not say, far more pleasurably.  Even in Shakespeare&#x27;s own day this use of his plays was recognised.  &#x27;The historical plays teach history to those who cannot read it in the chronicles,&#x27; says Heywood in a tract about the stage, and yet I am sure that sixteenth-century chronicles were much more delightful reading than nineteenth-century primers are.  Of course the aesthetic value of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays does not, in the slightest degree, depend on their facts, but on their Truth, and Truth is independent of facts always, inventing or selecting them at pleasure.  But still Shakespeare&#x27;s use of facts is a most interesting part of his method of work, and shows us his attitude towards the stage, and his relations to the great art of illusion. Indeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classing his plays with &#x27;fairy tales,&#x27; as Lord Lytton does; for one of his aims was to create for England a national historical drama, which should deal with incidents with which the public was well acquainted, and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people. Patriotism, I need hardly say, is not a necessary quality of art; but it means, for the artist, the substitution of a universal for an individual feeling, and for the public the presentation of a work of art in a most attractive and popular form.  It is worth noticing that Shakespeare&#x27;s first and last successes were both historical plays.  It may be asked, what has this to do with Shakespeare&#x27;s attitude towards costume?  I answer that a dramatist who laid such stress on historical accuracy of fact would have welcomed historical accuracy of costume as a most important adjunct to his illusionist method. And I have no hesitation in saying that he did so.  The reference to helmets of the period in the prologue to HENRY THE FIFTH may be considered fanciful, though Shakespeare must have often seen   The very casque That did affright the air at Agincourt,   where it still hangs in the dusky gloom of Westminster Abbey, along with the saddle of that &#x27;imp of fame,&#x27; and the dinted shield with its torn blue velvet lining and its tarnished lilies of gold; but the use of military tabards in HENRY THE SIXTH is a bit of pure archaeology, as they were not worn in the sixteenth century; and the King&#x27;s own tabard, I may mention, was still suspended over his tomb in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, in Shakespeare&#x27;s day.  For, up to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the Philistines in 1645, the chapels and cathedrals of England were the great national museums of archaeology, and in them were kept the armour and attire of the heroes of English history.  A good deal was of course preserved in the Tower, and even in Elizabeth&#x27;s day tourists were brought there to see such curious relics of the past as Charles Brandon&#x27;s huge lance, which is still, I believe, the admiration of our country visitors; but the cathedrals and churches were, as a rule, selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception of the historic antiquities.  Canterbury can still show us the helm of the Black Prince, Westminster the robes of our kings, and in old St. Paul&#x27;s the very banner that had waved on Bosworth field was hung up by Richmond himself.  In fact, everywhere that Shakespeare turned in London, he saw the apparel and appurtenances of past ages, and it is impossible to doubt that he made use of his opportunities.  The employment of lance and shield, for instance, in actual warfare, which is so frequent in his plays, is drawn from archaeology, and not from the military accoutrements of his day; and his general use of armour in battle was not a characteristic of his age, a time when it was rapidly disappearing before firearms.  Again, the crest on Warwick&#x27;s helmet, of which such a point is made in HENRY THE SIXTH, is absolutely correct in a fifteenth-century play when crests were generally worn, but would not have been so in a play of Shakespeare&#x27;s own time, when feathers and plumes had taken their place - a fashion which, as he tells us in HENRY THE EIGHTH, was borrowed from France.  For the historical plays, then, we may be sure that archaeology was employed, and as for the others I feel certain that it was the case also.  The appearance of Jupiter on his eagle, thunderbolt in hand, of Juno with her peacocks, and of Iris with her many-coloured bow; the Amazon masque and the masque of the Five Worthies, may all be regarded as archaeological; and the vision which Posthumus sees in prison of Sicilius Leonatus - &#x27;an old man, attired like a warrior, leading an ancient matron&#x27; - is clearly so.  Of the &#x27;Athenian dress&#x27; by which Lysander is distinguished from Oberon I have already spoken; but one of the most marked instances is in the case of the dress of Coriolanus, for which Shakespeare goes directly to Plutarch.  That historian, in his Life of the great Roman, tells us of the oak-wreath with which Caius Marcius was crowned, and of the curious kind of dress in which, according to ancient fashion, he had to canvass his electors; and on both of these points he enters into long disquisitions, investigating the origin and meaning of the old customs.  Shakespeare, in the spirit of the true artist, accepts the facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic and picturesque effects  and, as far as dramatic value goes, to confuse the costumes is to confuse the play.  Costume is a growth, an evolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, sign of the manners, customs and mode of life of each century.  The Puritan dislike of colour, adornment and grace in apparel was part of the great revolt of the middle classes against Beauty in the seventeenth century.  A historian who disregarded it would give us a most inaccurate picture of the time, and a dramatist who did not avail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing an illusionist effect.  The effeminacy of dress that characterised the reign of Richard the Second was a constant theme of contemporary authors.  Shakespeare, writing two hundred years after, makes the king&#x27;s fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in the play, from John of Gaunt&#x27;s reproaches down to Richard&#x27;s own speech in the third act on his deposition from the throne.  And that Shakespeare examined Richard&#x27;s tomb in Westminster Abbey seems to me certain from York&#x27;s speech  it is not merely a dangerous colour to wear by gaslight, but it is really difficult in England to get a thoroughly good blue.  The fine Chinese blue, which we all so much admire, takes two years to dye, and the English public will not wait so long for a colour.  Peacock blue, of course, has been employed on the stage, notably at the Lyceum, with great advantage; but all attempts at a good light blue, or good dark blue, which I have seen have been failures.  The value of black is hardly appreciated; it was used effectively by Mr. Irving in HAMLET as the central note of a composition, but as a tone-giving neutral its importance is not recognised.  And this is curious, considering the general colour of the dress of a century in which, as Baudelaire says, &#x27;Nous celebrons tous quelque enterrement.&#x27;  The archaeologist of the future will probably point to this age as the time when the beauty of black was understood; but I hardly think that, as regards stage-mounting or house decoration, it really is.  Its decorative value is, of course, the same as that of white or gold; it can separate and harmonise colours.  In modern plays the black frock- coat of the hero becomes important in itself, and should be given a suitable background.  But it rarely is.  Indeed the only good background for a play in modern dress which I have ever seen was the dark grey and cream-white scene of the first act of the PRINCESSE GEORGES in Mrs. Langtry&#x27;s production.  As a rule, the hero is smothered in BRIC-E-BRAC and palm-trees, lost in the gilded abyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge in the midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always be kept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.  This, of course, can only be done when there is one single mind directing the whole production.  The facts of art are diverse, but the essence of artistic effect is unity.  Monarchy, Anarchy, and Republicanism may contend for the government of nations; but a theatre should be in the power of a cultured despot.  There may be division of labour, but there must be no division of mind.  Whoever understands the costume of an age understands of necessity its architecture and its surroundings also, and it is easy to see from the chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines or not.  In fact, in art there is no specialism, and a really artistic production should bear the impress of one master, and one master only, who not merely should design and arrange everything, but should have complete control over the way in which each dress is to be worn.  Mademoiselle Mars, in the first production of HERNANI, absolutely refused to call her lover &#x27;MON LION!&#x27; unless she was allowed to wear a little fashionable TOQUE then much in vogue on the Boulevards; and many young ladies on our own stage insist to the present day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under Greek dresses, to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold; but these wicked things should not be allowed.  And there should be far more dress rehearsals than there are now.  Actors such as Mr. Forbes-Robertson, Mr. Conway, Mr. George Alexander, and others, not to mention older artists, can move with ease and elegance in the attire of any century; but there are not a few who seem dreadfully embarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets, and who always wear their dresses as if they were costumes.  Costumes, of course, they are to the designer; but dresses they should be to those that wear them.  And it is time that a stop should be put to the idea, very prevalent on the stage, that the Greeks and Romans always went about bareheaded in the open air - a mistake the Elizabethan managers did not fall into, for they gave hoods as well as gowns to their Roman senators.  More dress rehearsals would also be of value in explaining to the actors that there is a form of gesture and movement that is not merely appropriate to each style of dress, but really conditioned by it.  The extravagant use of the arms in the eighteenth century, for instance, was the necessary result of the large hoop, and the solemn dignity of Burleigh owed as much to his ruff as to his reason.  Besides until an actor is at home in his dress, he is not at home in his part.  Of the value of beautiful costume in creating an artistic temperament in the audience, and producing that joy in beauty for beauty&#x27;s sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood, I will not here speak; though it is worth while to notice how Shakespeare appreciated that side of the question in the production of his tragedies, acting them always by artificial light, and in a theatre hung with black; but what I have tried to point out is that archaeology is not a pedantic method, but a method of artistic illusion, and that costume is a means of displaying character without description, and of producing dramatic situations and dramatic effects.  And I think it is a pity that so many critics should have set themselves to attack one of the most important movements on the modern stage before that movement has at all reached its proper perfection.  That it will do so, however, I feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics in the future higher qualification than that they can remember Macready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them, indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty.  POUR ETRE PLUS DIFFICILE, LA TACHE N&#x27;EN EST QUE PLUS GLORIEUSE.  And if they will not encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of which Shakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it has the illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beauty for its result.  Not that I agree with everything that I have said in this essay.  There is much with which I entirely disagree.  The essay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in aesthetic criticism attitude is everything.  For in art there is no such thing as a universal truth.  A Truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true.  And just as it is only in art- criticism, and through it, that we can apprehend the Platonic theory of ideas, so it is only in art-criticism, and through it, that we can realise Hegel&#x27;s system of contraries.  The truths of metaphysics are the truths of masks.      End"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:description" content="THE TRUTH OF MASKS - A NOTE ON ILLUSION    In many of the somewhat violent attacks that have recently been made on that splendour of mounting which now characterises our Shakespearian revivals in England, it seems to have been tacitly assumed by the critics that Shakespeare himself was more or less indifferent to the costumes of his actors, and that, could he see Mrs. Langtry&#x27;s production of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA, he would probably say that the play, and the play only, is the thing, and that everything else is leather and prunella.  While, as regards any historical accuracy in dress, Lord Lytton, in an article in the NINETEENTH CENTURY, has laid it down as a dogma of art that archaeology is entirely out of place in the presentation of any of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and the attempt to introduce it one of the stupidest pedantries of an age of prigs.  Lord Lytton&#x27;s position I shall examine later on; but, as regards the theory that Shakespeare did not busy himself much about the costume-wardrobe of his theatre, anybody who cares to study Shakespeare&#x27;s method will see that there is absolutely no dramatist of the French, English, or Athenian stage who relies so much for his illusionist effects on the dress of his actors as Shakespeare does himself.  Knowing how the artistic temperament is always fascinated by beauty of costume, he constantly introduces into his plays masques and dances, purely for the sake of the pleasure which they give the eye; and we have still his stage-directions for the three great processions in HENRY THE EIGHTH, directions which are characterised by the most extraordinary elaborateness of detail down to the collars of S.S. and the pearls in Anne Boleyn&#x27;s hair.  Indeed it would be quite easy for a modern manager to reproduce these pageants absolutely as Shakespeare had them designed; and so accurate were they that one of the court officials of the time, writing an account of the last performance of the play at the Globe Theatre to a friend, actually complains of their realistic character, notably of the production on the stage of the Knights of the Garter in the robes and insignia of the order as being calculated to bring ridicule on the real ceremonies; much in the same spirit in which the French Government, some time ago, prohibited that delightful actor, M. Christian, from appearing in uniform, on the plea that it was prejudicial to the glory of the army that a colonel should be caricatured.  And elsewhere the gorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the English stage under Shakespeare&#x27;s influence was attacked by the contemporary critics, not as a rule, however, on the grounds of the democratic tendencies of realism, but usually on those moral grounds which are always the last refuge of people who have no sense of beauty.  The point, however, which I wish to emphasise is, not that Shakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in adding picturesqueness to poetry, but that he saw how important costume is as a means of producing certain dramatic effects.  Many of his plays, such as MEASURE FOR MEASURE, TWELFTH NIGHT, THE TWO GENTLEMAN OF VERONA, ALL&#x27;S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, CYMBELINE, and others, depend for their illusion on the character of the various dresses worn by the hero or the heroine; the delightful scene in HENRY THE SIXTH, on the modern miracles of healing by faith, loses all its point unless Gloster is in black and scarlet; and the DENOUMENT of the MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR hinges on the colour of Anne Page&#x27;s gown.  As for the uses Shakespeare makes of disguises the instances are almost numberless.  Posthumus hides his passion under a peasant&#x27;s garb, and Edgar his pride beneath an idiot&#x27;s rags; Portia wears the apparel of a lawyer, and Rosalind is attired in &#x27;all points as a man&#x27;; the cloak-bag of Pisanio changes Imogen to the Youth Fidele; Jessica flees from her father&#x27;s house in boy&#x27;s dress, and Julia ties up her yellow hair in fantastic love-knots, and dons hose and doublet; Henry the Eighth woos his lady as a shepherd, and Romeo his as a pilgrim; Prince Hal and Poins appear first as footpads in buckram suits, and then in white aprons and leather jerkins as the waiters in a tavern-   I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. &#x27;Twas on a summer&#x27;s evening, in his tent, The day he overcame the Nervii See what a rent the envious Casca made-   Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse, Which in the day of battle tire thee more Than all the complete armour that thou wear&#x27;st.   As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, it is to be remarked that, while he more than once complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historical plays, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many effective open-air incidents, he always writes as a dramatist who had at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and who could rely on the actors taking pains about their make-up.  Even now it is difficult to produce such a play as the COMEDY OF ERRORS; and to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry&#x27;s brother resembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing TWELFTH NIGHT adequately performed.  Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare&#x27;s on the stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requires the services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, a costumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, a master of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing- master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production. For he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of each character.  &#x27;Racine abhorre la realite,&#x27; says Auguste Vacquerie somewhere; &#x27;il ne daigne pas s&#x27;occuper de son costume.  Si l&#x27;on s&#x27;en rapportait aux indications du poete, Agamemnon serait vetu d&#x27;un sceptre et Achille d&#x27;une epee.&#x27;  But with Shakespeare it is very different.  He gives us directions about the costumes of Perdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in MACBETH, and the apothecary in ROMEO AND JULIET, several elaborate descriptions of his fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb in which Petruchio is to be married.  Rosalind, he tells us, is tall, and is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, and is to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt.  The children who play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in white and green - a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whose favourite colours they were - and in white, with green garlands and gilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton. Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by his wearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his boots.  The Duchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband in mourning beside her.  The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of the Cardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, are all made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue.  We know the patterns on the Dauphin&#x27;s armour and the Pucelle&#x27;s sword, the crest on Warwick&#x27;s helmet and the colour of Bardolph&#x27;s nose.  Portia has golden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls, and Sir Andrew Aguecheek&#x27;s hair hangs like flax on a distaff, and won&#x27;t curl at all.  Some of the characters are stout, some lean, some straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some are to blacken their faces.  Lear has a white beard, Hamlet&#x27;s father a grizzled, and Benedick is to shave his in the course of the play. Indeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quite elaborate; tells us of the many different colours in use, and gives a hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on. There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics in hairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians, and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in an ass&#x27;s head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes the Lord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriated husband and his wife&#x27;s milliner about the slashing of a sleeve.  As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and the aphorisms he makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age, particularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies&#x27; bonnets, and the many descriptions of the MUNDUS MULIEBRIS, from the long of Autolycus in the WINTER&#x27;S TALE down to the account of the Duchess of Milan&#x27;s gown in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, they are far too numerous to quote; though it may be worth while to remind people that the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to be found in Lear&#x27;s scene with Edgar - a passage which has the advantage of brevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthing metaphysics of SARTOR RESARTUS.  But I think that from what I have already said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very much interested in costume.  I do not mean in that shallow sense by which it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds and daffodils that he was the Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethan age; but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressive of a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain types of character, and is one of the essential factors of the means which a true illusionist has at his disposal.  Indeed to him the deformed figure of Richard was of as much value as Juliet&#x27;s loveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks of the lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each  and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one of his plays, expresses his regret at being unable to produce helmets of the period, he is speaking as an Elizabethan manager and not merely as an Elizabethan poet.  At Cambridge, for instance, during his day, a play of RICHARD THE THIRD was performed, in which the actors were attired in real dresses of the time, procured from the great collection of historical costume in the Tower, which was always open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes placed at their disposal.  And I cannot help thinking that this performance must have been far more artistic, as regards costume, than Garrick&#x27;s mounting of Shakespeare&#x27;s own play on the subject, in which he himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, and everybody else in the costume of the time of George the Third, Richmond especially being much admired in the uniform of a young guardsman.  For what is the use to the stage of that archaeology which has so strangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, can give us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in which the action of the play passes?  It enables us to see a Greek dressed like a Greek, and an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy the arcades of Venice and the balconies of Verona; and, if the play deals with any of the great eras in our country&#x27;s history, to contemplate the age in its proper attire, and the king in his habit as he lived.  And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would have said some time ago, at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, had the curtain risen on his father&#x27;s Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair, attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costume which in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate to an antique Roman!  For in those halcyon days of the drama no archaeology troubled the stage, or distressed the critics, and our inartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere of anachronisms, and beheld with the calm complacency of the age of prose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a Lear in lace ruffles, and a Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline.  I can understand archaeology being attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but to attack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark. However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just as well speak disrespectfully of the equator.  For archaeology, being a science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply.  Its value depends entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it. We look to the archaeologist for the materials, to the artist for the method.  In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, the first thing the artist has to settle is the best date for the drama.  This should be determined by the general spirit of the play, more than by any actual historical references which may occur in it.  Most HAMLETS I have seen were placed far too early. HAMLET is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and if the allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts it back to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down much later.  Once, however, that the date has been fixed, then the archaeologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is to convert into effects.  It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves show us that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and a great deal of capital has been made out of Hector&#x27;s indiscreet quotation from Aristotle.  Upon the other hand, the anachronisms are really few in number, and not very important, and, had Shakespeare&#x27;s attention been drawn to them by a brother artist, he would probably have corrected them.  For, though they can hardly be called blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of his work; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannot be emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according to its proper date.  In looking at Shakespeare&#x27;s plays as a whole, however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelity as regards his personages and his plots.  Many of his DRAMATIS PERSONAE are people who had actually existed, and some of them might have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience. Indeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in his time was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.  As for his plots, Shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentic history, or from the old ballads and traditions which served as history to the Elizabethan public, and which even now no scientific historian would dismiss as absolutely untrue.  And not merely did he select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of his imaginative work, but he always gives to each play the general character, the social atmosphere in a word, of the age in question. Stupidity he recognises as being one of the permanent characteristics of all European civilisations; so he sees no difference between a London mob of his own day and a Roman mob of pagan days, between a silly watchman in Messina and a silly Justice of the Peace in Windsor.  But when he deals with higher characters, with those exceptions of each age which are so fine that they become its types, he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal of their time.  Virgilia is one of those Roman wives on whose tomb was written &#x27;Domi mansit, lanam fecit,&#x27; as surely as Juliet is the romantic girl of the Renaissance.  He is even true to the characteristics of race.  Hamlet has all the imagination and irresolution of the Northern nations, and the Princess Katharine is as entirely French as the heroine of DIVORCONS.  Harry the Fifth is a pure Englishman, and Othello a true Moor.  Again when Shakespeare treats of the history of England from the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it is wonderful how careful he is to have his facts perfectly right - indeed he follows Holinshed with curious fidelity.  The incessant wars between France and England are described with extraordinary accuracy down to the names of the besieged towns, the ports of landing and embarkation, the sites and dates of the battles, the titles of the commanders on each side, and the lists of the killed and wounded.  And as regards the Civil Wars of the Roses we have many elaborate genealogies of the seven sons of Edward the Third; the claims of the rival Houses of York and Lancaster to the throne are discussed at length; and if the English aristocracy will not read Shakespeare as a poet, they should certainly read him as a sort of early Peerage.  There is hardly a single title in the Upper House, with the exception of course of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords, which does not appear in Shakespeare along with many details of family history, creditable and discreditable.  Indeed if it be really necessary that the School Board children should know all about the Wars of the Roses, they could learn their lessons just as well out of Shakespeare as out of shilling primers, and learn them, I need not say, far more pleasurably.  Even in Shakespeare&#x27;s own day this use of his plays was recognised.  &#x27;The historical plays teach history to those who cannot read it in the chronicles,&#x27; says Heywood in a tract about the stage, and yet I am sure that sixteenth-century chronicles were much more delightful reading than nineteenth-century primers are.  Of course the aesthetic value of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays does not, in the slightest degree, depend on their facts, but on their Truth, and Truth is independent of facts always, inventing or selecting them at pleasure.  But still Shakespeare&#x27;s use of facts is a most interesting part of his method of work, and shows us his attitude towards the stage, and his relations to the great art of illusion. Indeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classing his plays with &#x27;fairy tales,&#x27; as Lord Lytton does; for one of his aims was to create for England a national historical drama, which should deal with incidents with which the public was well acquainted, and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people. Patriotism, I need hardly say, is not a necessary quality of art; but it means, for the artist, the substitution of a universal for an individual feeling, and for the public the presentation of a work of art in a most attractive and popular form.  It is worth noticing that Shakespeare&#x27;s first and last successes were both historical plays.  It may be asked, what has this to do with Shakespeare&#x27;s attitude towards costume?  I answer that a dramatist who laid such stress on historical accuracy of fact would have welcomed historical accuracy of costume as a most important adjunct to his illusionist method. And I have no hesitation in saying that he did so.  The reference to helmets of the period in the prologue to HENRY THE FIFTH may be considered fanciful, though Shakespeare must have often seen   The very casque That did affright the air at Agincourt,   where it still hangs in the dusky gloom of Westminster Abbey, along with the saddle of that &#x27;imp of fame,&#x27; and the dinted shield with its torn blue velvet lining and its tarnished lilies of gold; but the use of military tabards in HENRY THE SIXTH is a bit of pure archaeology, as they were not worn in the sixteenth century; and the King&#x27;s own tabard, I may mention, was still suspended over his tomb in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, in Shakespeare&#x27;s day.  For, up to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the Philistines in 1645, the chapels and cathedrals of England were the great national museums of archaeology, and in them were kept the armour and attire of the heroes of English history.  A good deal was of course preserved in the Tower, and even in Elizabeth&#x27;s day tourists were brought there to see such curious relics of the past as Charles Brandon&#x27;s huge lance, which is still, I believe, the admiration of our country visitors; but the cathedrals and churches were, as a rule, selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception of the historic antiquities.  Canterbury can still show us the helm of the Black Prince, Westminster the robes of our kings, and in old St. Paul&#x27;s the very banner that had waved on Bosworth field was hung up by Richmond himself.  In fact, everywhere that Shakespeare turned in London, he saw the apparel and appurtenances of past ages, and it is impossible to doubt that he made use of his opportunities.  The employment of lance and shield, for instance, in actual warfare, which is so frequent in his plays, is drawn from archaeology, and not from the military accoutrements of his day; and his general use of armour in battle was not a characteristic of his age, a time when it was rapidly disappearing before firearms.  Again, the crest on Warwick&#x27;s helmet, of which such a point is made in HENRY THE SIXTH, is absolutely correct in a fifteenth-century play when crests were generally worn, but would not have been so in a play of Shakespeare&#x27;s own time, when feathers and plumes had taken their place - a fashion which, as he tells us in HENRY THE EIGHTH, was borrowed from France.  For the historical plays, then, we may be sure that archaeology was employed, and as for the others I feel certain that it was the case also.  The appearance of Jupiter on his eagle, thunderbolt in hand, of Juno with her peacocks, and of Iris with her many-coloured bow; the Amazon masque and the masque of the Five Worthies, may all be regarded as archaeological; and the vision which Posthumus sees in prison of Sicilius Leonatus - &#x27;an old man, attired like a warrior, leading an ancient matron&#x27; - is clearly so.  Of the &#x27;Athenian dress&#x27; by which Lysander is distinguished from Oberon I have already spoken; but one of the most marked instances is in the case of the dress of Coriolanus, for which Shakespeare goes directly to Plutarch.  That historian, in his Life of the great Roman, tells us of the oak-wreath with which Caius Marcius was crowned, and of the curious kind of dress in which, according to ancient fashion, he had to canvass his electors; and on both of these points he enters into long disquisitions, investigating the origin and meaning of the old customs.  Shakespeare, in the spirit of the true artist, accepts the facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic and picturesque effects  and, as far as dramatic value goes, to confuse the costumes is to confuse the play.  Costume is a growth, an evolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, sign of the manners, customs and mode of life of each century.  The Puritan dislike of colour, adornment and grace in apparel was part of the great revolt of the middle classes against Beauty in the seventeenth century.  A historian who disregarded it would give us a most inaccurate picture of the time, and a dramatist who did not avail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing an illusionist effect.  The effeminacy of dress that characterised the reign of Richard the Second was a constant theme of contemporary authors.  Shakespeare, writing two hundred years after, makes the king&#x27;s fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in the play, from John of Gaunt&#x27;s reproaches down to Richard&#x27;s own speech in the third act on his deposition from the throne.  And that Shakespeare examined Richard&#x27;s tomb in Westminster Abbey seems to me certain from York&#x27;s speech  it is not merely a dangerous colour to wear by gaslight, but it is really difficult in England to get a thoroughly good blue.  The fine Chinese blue, which we all so much admire, takes two years to dye, and the English public will not wait so long for a colour.  Peacock blue, of course, has been employed on the stage, notably at the Lyceum, with great advantage; but all attempts at a good light blue, or good dark blue, which I have seen have been failures.  The value of black is hardly appreciated; it was used effectively by Mr. Irving in HAMLET as the central note of a composition, but as a tone-giving neutral its importance is not recognised.  And this is curious, considering the general colour of the dress of a century in which, as Baudelaire says, &#x27;Nous celebrons tous quelque enterrement.&#x27;  The archaeologist of the future will probably point to this age as the time when the beauty of black was understood; but I hardly think that, as regards stage-mounting or house decoration, it really is.  Its decorative value is, of course, the same as that of white or gold; it can separate and harmonise colours.  In modern plays the black frock- coat of the hero becomes important in itself, and should be given a suitable background.  But it rarely is.  Indeed the only good background for a play in modern dress which I have ever seen was the dark grey and cream-white scene of the first act of the PRINCESSE GEORGES in Mrs. Langtry&#x27;s production.  As a rule, the hero is smothered in BRIC-E-BRAC and palm-trees, lost in the gilded abyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge in the midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always be kept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.  This, of course, can only be done when there is one single mind directing the whole production.  The facts of art are diverse, but the essence of artistic effect is unity.  Monarchy, Anarchy, and Republicanism may contend for the government of nations; but a theatre should be in the power of a cultured despot.  There may be division of labour, but there must be no division of mind.  Whoever understands the costume of an age understands of necessity its architecture and its surroundings also, and it is easy to see from the chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines or not.  In fact, in art there is no specialism, and a really artistic production should bear the impress of one master, and one master only, who not merely should design and arrange everything, but should have complete control over the way in which each dress is to be worn.  Mademoiselle Mars, in the first production of HERNANI, absolutely refused to call her lover &#x27;MON LION!&#x27; unless she was allowed to wear a little fashionable TOQUE then much in vogue on the Boulevards; and many young ladies on our own stage insist to the present day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under Greek dresses, to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold; but these wicked things should not be allowed.  And there should be far more dress rehearsals than there are now.  Actors such as Mr. Forbes-Robertson, Mr. Conway, Mr. George Alexander, and others, not to mention older artists, can move with ease and elegance in the attire of any century; but there are not a few who seem dreadfully embarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets, and who always wear their dresses as if they were costumes.  Costumes, of course, they are to the designer; but dresses they should be to those that wear them.  And it is time that a stop should be put to the idea, very prevalent on the stage, that the Greeks and Romans always went about bareheaded in the open air - a mistake the Elizabethan managers did not fall into, for they gave hoods as well as gowns to their Roman senators.  More dress rehearsals would also be of value in explaining to the actors that there is a form of gesture and movement that is not merely appropriate to each style of dress, but really conditioned by it.  The extravagant use of the arms in the eighteenth century, for instance, was the necessary result of the large hoop, and the solemn dignity of Burleigh owed as much to his ruff as to his reason.  Besides until an actor is at home in his dress, he is not at home in his part.  Of the value of beautiful costume in creating an artistic temperament in the audience, and producing that joy in beauty for beauty&#x27;s sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood, I will not here speak; though it is worth while to notice how Shakespeare appreciated that side of the question in the production of his tragedies, acting them always by artificial light, and in a theatre hung with black; but what I have tried to point out is that archaeology is not a pedantic method, but a method of artistic illusion, and that costume is a means of displaying character without description, and of producing dramatic situations and dramatic effects.  And I think it is a pity that so many critics should have set themselves to attack one of the most important movements on the modern stage before that movement has at all reached its proper perfection.  That it will do so, however, I feel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic critics in the future higher qualification than that they can remember Macready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them, indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty.  POUR ETRE PLUS DIFFICILE, LA TACHE N&#x27;EN EST QUE PLUS GLORIEUSE.  And if they will not encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of which Shakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it has the illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beauty for its result.  Not that I agree with everything that I have said in this essay.  There is much with which I entirely disagree.  The essay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in aesthetic criticism attitude is everything.  For in art there is no such thing as a universal truth.  A Truth in art is that whose contradictory is also true.  And just as it is only in art- criticism, and through it, that we can apprehend the Platonic theory of ideas, so it is only in art-criticism, and through it, that we can realise Hegel&#x27;s system of contraries.  The truths of metaphysics are the truths of masks.      End"><link data-rh="true" rel="icon" href="/img/docusaurus.svg"><link data-rh="true" rel="canonical" href="https://www.123j.com/google/THE TRUTH OF MASKS"><link data-rh="true" rel="alternate" href="https://www.123j.com/google/THE TRUTH OF MASKS" hreflang="zh"><link data-rh="true" rel="alternate" href="https://www.123j.com/google/THE TRUTH OF MASKS" hreflang="x-default"><link data-rh="true" rel="preconnect" href="https://X1Z85QJPUV-dsn.algolia.net" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/blog/rss.xml" title="masterpiece RSS Feed">

MASKS</h1></header><p>THE TRUTH OF MASKS - A NOTE ON ILLUSION</p>
<p>In many of the somewhat violent attacks that have recently beenmade on that splendour of mounting which now characterises ourShakespearian revivals in England, it seems to have been tacitlyassumed by the critics that Shakespeare himself was more or lessindifferent to the costumes of his actors, and that, could he seeMrs. Langtry&#x27;s production of ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA, he wouldprobably say that the play, and the play only, is the thing, andthat everything else is leather and prunella.  While, as regardsany historical accuracy in dress, Lord Lytton, in an article in theNINETEENTH CENTURY, has laid it down as a dogma of art thatarchaeology is entirely out of place in the presentation of any ofShakespeare&#x27;s plays, and the attempt to introduce it one of thestupidest pedantries of an age of prigs.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton&#x27;s position I shall examine later on; but, as regardsthe theory that Shakespeare did not busy himself much about thecostume-wardrobe of his theatre, anybody who cares to studyShakespeare&#x27;s method will see that there is absolutely no dramatistof the French, English, or Athenian stage who relies so much forhis illusionist effects on the dress of his actors as Shakespearedoes himself.</p>
<p>Knowing how the artistic temperament is always fascinated by beautyof costume, he constantly introduces into his plays masques anddances, purely for the sake of the pleasure which they give theeye; and we have still his stage-directions for the three greatprocessions in HENRY THE EIGHTH, directions which are characterisedby the most extraordinary elaborateness of detail down to thecollars of S.S. and the pearls in Anne Boleyn&#x27;s hair.  Indeed itwould be quite easy for a modern manager to reproduce thesepageants absolutely as Shakespeare had them designed; and soaccurate were they that one of the court officials of the time,writing an account of the last performance of the play at the GlobeTheatre to a friend, actually complains of their realisticcharacter, notably of the production on the stage of the Knights ofthe Garter in the robes and insignia of the order as beingcalculated to bring ridicule on the real ceremonies; much in thesame spirit in which the French Government, some time ago,prohibited that delightful actor, M. Christian, from appearing inuniform, on the plea that it was prejudicial to the glory of thearmy that a colonel should be caricatured.  And elsewhere thegorgeousness of apparel which distinguished the English stage underShakespeare&#x27;s influence was attacked by the contemporary critics,not as a rule, however, on the grounds of the democratic tendenciesof realism, but usually on those moral grounds which are always thelast refuge of people who have no sense of beauty.</p>
<p>The point, however, which I wish to emphasise is, not thatShakespeare appreciated the value of lovely costumes in addingpicturesqueness to poetry, but that he saw how important costume isas a means of producing certain dramatic effects.  Many of hisplays, such as MEASURE FOR MEASURE, TWELFTH NIGHT, THE TWOGENTLEMAN OF VERONA, ALL&#x27;S WELL THAT ENDS WELL, CYMBELINE, andothers, depend for their illusion on the character of the variousdresses worn by the hero or the heroine; the delightful scene inHENRY THE SIXTH, on the modern miracles of healing by faith, losesall its point unless Gloster is in black and scarlet; and theDENOUMENT of the MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR hinges on the colour ofAnne Page&#x27;s gown.  As for the uses Shakespeare makes of disguisesthe instances are almost numberless.  Posthumus hides his passionunder a peasant&#x27;s garb, and Edgar his pride beneath an idiot&#x27;srags; Portia wears the apparel of a lawyer, and Rosalind is attiredin &#x27;all points as a man&#x27;; the cloak-bag of Pisanio changes Imogento the Youth Fidele; Jessica flees from her father&#x27;s house in boy&#x27;sdress, and Julia ties up her yellow hair in fantastic love-knots,and dons hose and doublet; Henry the Eighth woos his lady as ashepherd, and Romeo his as a pilgrim; Prince Hal and Poins appearfirst as footpads in buckram suits, and then in white aprons andleather jerkins as the waiters in a tavern:  and as for Falstaff,does he not come on as a highwayman, as an old woman, as Herne theHunter, and as the clothes going to the laundry?</p>
<p>Nor are the examples of the employment of costume as a mode ofintensifying dramatic situation less numerous.  After slaughter ofDuncan, Macbeth appears in his night-gown as if aroused from sleep;Timon ends in rags the play he had begun in splendour; Richardflatters the London citizens in a suit of mean and shabby armour,and, as soon as he has stepped in blood to the throne, marchesthrough the streets in crown and George and Garter; the climax ofTHE TEMPEST is reached when Prospero, throwing off his enchanter&#x27;srobes, sends Ariel for his hat and rapier, and reveals himself asthe great Italian Duke; the very Ghost in HAMLET changes hismystical apparel to produce different effects; and as for Juliet, amodern playwright would probably have laid her out in her shroud,and made the scene a scene of horror merely, but Shakespeare arraysher in rich and gorgeous raiment, whose loveliness makes the vault&#x27;a feasting presence full of light,&#x27; turns the tomb into a bridalchamber, and gives the cue and motive for Romeo&#x27;s speech of thetriumph of Beauty over Death.</p>
<p>Even small details of dress, such as the colour of a major-domo&#x27;sstockings, the pattern on a wife&#x27;s handkerchief, the sleeve of ayoung soldier, and a fashionable woman&#x27;s bonnets, become inShakespeare&#x27;s hands points of actual dramatic importance, and bysome of them the action of the play in question is conditionedabsolutely.  Many other dramatists have availed themselves ofcostume as a method of expressing directly to the audience thecharacter of a person on his entrance, though hardly so brilliantlyas Shakespeare has done in the case of the dandy Parolles, whosedress, by the way, only an archaeologist can understand; the fun ofa master and servant exchanging coats in presence of the audience,of shipwrecked sailors squabbling over the division of a lot offine clothes, and of a tinker dressed up like a duke while he is inhis cups, may be regarded as part of that great career whichcostume has always played in comedy from the time of Aristophanesdown to Mr. Gilbert; but nobody from the mere details of appareland adornment has ever drawn such irony of contrast, such immediateand tragic effect, such pity and such pathos, as Shakespearehimself.  Armed cap-e-pie, the dead King stalks on the battlementsof Elsinore because all is not right with Denmark; Shylock&#x27;s Jewishgaberdine is part of the stigma under which that wounded andembittered nature writhes; Arthur begging for his life can think ofno better plea than the handkerchief he had given Hubert -</p>
<p>Have you the heart? when your head did but ache,I knit my handkerchief about your brows,(The best I had, a princess wrought it me)And I did never ask it you again;</p>
<p>and Orlando&#x27;s blood-stained napkin strikes the first sombre note inthat exquisite woodland idyll, and shows us the depth of feelingthat underlies Rosalind&#x27;s fanciful wit and wilful jesting.</p>
<p>Last night &#x27;twas on my arm; I kissed it;I hope it be not gone to tell my lordThat I kiss aught but he,</p>
<p>says Imogen, jesting on the loss of the bracelet which was alreadyon its way to Rome to rob her of her husband&#x27;s faith; the littlePrince passing to the Tower plays with the dagger in his uncle&#x27;sgirdle; Duncan sends a ring to Lady Macbeth on the night of his ownmurder, and the ring of Portia turns the tragedy of the merchantinto a wife&#x27;s comedy.  The great rebel York dies with a paper crownon his head; Hamlet&#x27;s black suit is a kind of colour-motive in thepiece, like the mourning of the Chimene in the CID; and the climaxof Antony&#x27;s speech is the production of Caesar&#x27;s cloak:-</p>
<p>I rememberThe first time ever Caesar put it on.&#x27;Twas on a summer&#x27;s evening, in his tent,The day he overcame the Nervii:-Look, in this place ran Cassius&#x27; dagger through:See what a rent the envious Casca made:Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed. . . .Kind souls, what, weep you when you but beholdOur Caesar&#x27;s vesture wounded?</p>
<p>The flowers which Ophelia carries with her in her madness are aspathetic as the violets that blossom on a grave; the effect ofLear&#x27;s wandering on the heath is intensified beyond words by hisfantastic attire; and when Cloten, stung by the taunt of thatsimile which his sister draws from her husband&#x27;s raiment, arrayshimself in that husband&#x27;s very garb to work upon her the deed ofshame, we feel that there is nothing in the whole of modern Frenchrealism, nothing even in THERESE RAQUIN, that masterpiece ofhorror, which for terrible and tragic significance can compare withthis strange scene in CYMBELINE.</p>
<p>In the actual dialogue also some of the most vivid passages arethose suggested by costume.  Rosalind&#x27;s</p>
<p>Dost thou think, though I am caparisoned like a man, I have adoublet and hose in my disposition?</p>
<p>Constance&#x27;s</p>
<p>Grief fills the place of my absent child,Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;</p>
<p>and the quick sharp cry of Elizabeth -</p>
<p>Ah! cut my lace asunder! -</p>
<p>are only a few of the many examples one might quote.  One of thefinest effects I have ever seen on the stage was Salvini, in thelast act of LEAR, tearing the plume from Kent&#x27;s cap and applying itto Cordelia&#x27;s lips when he came to the line,</p>
<p>This feather stirs; she lives!</p>
<p>Mr. Booth, whose Lear had many noble qualities of passion, plucked,I remember, some fur from his archaeologically-incorrect ermine forthe same business; but Salvini&#x27;s was the finer effect of the two,as well as the truer.  And those who saw Mr. Irving in the last actof RICHARD THE THIRD have not, I am sure, forgotten how much theagony and terror of his dream was intensified, by contrast, throughthe calm and quiet that preceded it, and the delivery of such linesas</p>
<p>What, is my beaver easier than it was?And all my armour laid into my tent?Look that my staves be sound and not too heavy -</p>
<p>lines which had a double meaning for the audience, remembering thelast words which Richard&#x27;s mother called after him as he wasmarching to Bosworth:-</p>
<p>Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,Which in the day of battle tire thee moreThan all the complete armour that thou wear&#x27;st.</p>
<p>As regards the resources which Shakespeare had at his disposal, itis to be remarked that, while he more than once complains of thesmallness of the stage on which he has to produce big historicalplays, and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out manyeffective open-air incidents, he always writes as a dramatist whohad at his disposal a most elaborate theatrical wardrobe, and whocould rely on the actors taking pains about their make-up.  Evennow it is difficult to produce such a play as the COMEDY OF ERRORS;and to the picturesque accident of Miss Ellen Terry&#x27;s brotherresembling herself we owe the opportunity of seeing TWELFTH NIGHTadequately performed.  Indeed, to put any play of Shakespeare&#x27;s onthe stage, absolutely as he himself wished it to be done, requiresthe services of a good property-man, a clever wig-maker, acostumier with a sense of colour and a knowledge of textures, amaster of the methods of making-up, a fencing-master, a dancing-master, and an artist to direct personally the whole production.For he is most careful to tell us the dress and appearance of eachcharacter.  &#x27;Racine abhorre la realite,&#x27; says Auguste Vacqueriesomewhere; &#x27;il ne daigne pas s&#x27;occuper de son costume.  Si l&#x27;ons&#x27;en rapportait aux indications du poete, Agamemnon serait vetud&#x27;un sceptre et Achille d&#x27;une epee.&#x27;  But with Shakespeare it isvery different.  He gives us directions about the costumes ofPerdita, Florizel, Autolycus, the Witches in MACBETH, and theapothecary in ROMEO AND JULIET, several elaborate descriptions ofhis fat knight, and a detailed account of the extraordinary garb inwhich Petruchio is to be married.  Rosalind, he tells us, is tall,and is to carry a spear and a little dagger; Celia is smaller, andis to paint her face brown so as to look sunburnt.  The childrenwho play at fairies in Windsor Forest are to be dressed in whiteand green - a compliment, by the way, to Queen Elizabeth, whosefavourite colours they were - and in white, with green garlands andgilded vizors, the angels are to come to Katherine in Kimbolton.Bottom is in homespun, Lysander is distinguished from Oberon by hiswearing an Athenian dress, and Launce has holes in his boots.  TheDuchess of Gloucester stands in a white sheet with her husband inmourning beside her.  The motley of the Fool, the scarlet of theCardinal, and the French lilies broidered on the English coats, areall made occasion for jest or taunt in the dialogue.  We know thepatterns on the Dauphin&#x27;s armour and the Pucelle&#x27;s sword, the creston Warwick&#x27;s helmet and the colour of Bardolph&#x27;s nose.  Portia hasgolden hair, Phoebe is black-haired, Orlando has chestnut curls,and Sir Andrew Aguecheek&#x27;s hair hangs like flax on a distaff, andwon&#x27;t curl at all.  Some of the characters are stout, some lean,some straight, some hunchbacked, some fair, some dark, and some areto blacken their faces.  Lear has a white beard, Hamlet&#x27;s father agrizzled, and Benedick is to shave his in the course of the play.Indeed, on the subject of stage beards Shakespeare is quiteelaborate; tells us of the many different colours in use, and givesa hint to actors always to see that their own are properly tied on.There is a dance of reapers in rye-straw hats, and of rustics inhairy coats like satyrs; a masque of Amazons, a masque of Russians,and a classical masque; several immortal scenes over a weaver in anass&#x27;s head, a riot over the colour of a coat which it takes theLord Mayor of London to quell, and a scene between an infuriatedhusband and his wife&#x27;s milliner about the slashing of a sleeve.</p>
<p>As for the metaphors Shakespeare draws from dress, and theaphorisms he makes on it, his hits at the costume of his age,particularly at the ridiculous size of the ladies&#x27; bonnets, and themany descriptions of the MUNDUS MULIEBRIS, from the long ofAutolycus in the WINTER&#x27;S TALE down to the account of the Duchessof Milan&#x27;s gown in MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, they are far toonumerous to quote; though it may be worth while to remind peoplethat the whole of the Philosophy of Clothes is to be found inLear&#x27;s scene with Edgar - a passage which has the advantage ofbrevity and style over the grotesque wisdom and somewhat mouthingmetaphysics of SARTOR RESARTUS.  But I think that from what I havealready said it is quite clear that Shakespeare was very muchinterested in costume.  I do not mean in that shallow sense bywhich it has been concluded from his knowledge of deeds anddaffodils that he was the Blackstone and Paxton of the Elizabethanage; but that he saw that costume could be made at once impressiveof a certain effect on the audience and expressive of certain typesof character, and is one of the essential factors of the meanswhich a true illusionist has at his disposal.  Indeed to him thedeformed figure of Richard was of as much value as Juliet&#x27;sloveliness; he sets the serge of the radical beside the silks ofthe lord, and sees the stage effects to be got from each:  he hasas much delight in Caliban as he has in Ariel, in rags as he has incloth of gold, and recognises the artistic beauty of ugliness.</p>
<p>The difficulty Ducis felt about translating OTHELLO in consequenceof the importance given to such a vulgar thing as a handkerchief,and his attempt to soften its grossness by making the Moorreiterate &#x27;Le bandeau! le bandeau!&#x27; may be taken as an example ofthe difference between LA TRAGEDIE PHILOSOPHIQUE and the drama ofreal life; and the introduction for the first time of the wordMOUCHOIR at the Theatre Francais was an era in that romantic-realistic movement of which Hugo is the father and M. Zola theENFANT TERRIBLE, just as the classicism of the earlier part of thecentury was emphasised by Talma&#x27;s refusal to play Greek heroes anylonger in a powdered periwig - one of the many instances, by theway, of that desire for archaeological accuracy in dress which hasdistinguished the great actors of our age.</p>
<p>In criticising the importance given to money in LA COMEDIE HUMAINE,Theophile Gautier says that Balzac may claim to have invented a newhero in fiction, LE HEROS METALLIQUE.  Of Shakespeare it may besaid he was the first to see the dramatic value of doublets, andthat a climax may depend on a crinoline.</p>
<p>The burning of the Globe Theatre - an event due, by the way, to theresults of the passion for illusion that distinguishedShakespeare&#x27;s stage-management - has unfortunately robbed us ofmany important documents; but in the inventory, still in existence,of the costume-wardrobe of a London theatre in Shakespeare&#x27;s time,there are mentioned particular costumes for cardinals, shepherds,kings, clowns, friars, and fools; green coats for Robin Hood&#x27;s men,and a green gown for Maid Marian; a white and gold doublet forHenry the Fifth, and a robe for Longshanks; besides surplices,copes, damask gowns, gowns of cloth of gold and of cloth of silver,taffeta gowns, calico gowns, velvet coats, satin coats, friezecoats, jerkins of yellow leather and of black leather, red suits,grey suits, French Pierrot suits, a robe &#x27;for to goo invisibell,&#x27;which seems inexpensive at 3 pounds, 10s., and four incomparablefardingales - all of which show a desire to give every character anappropriate dress.  There are also entries of Spanish, Moorish andDanish costumes, of helmets, lances, painted shields, imperialcrowns, and papal tiaras, as well as of costumes for TurkishJanissaries, Roman Senators, and all the gods and goddesses ofOlympus, which evidence a good deal of archaeological research onthe part of the manager of the theatre.  It is true that there is amention of a bodice for Eve, but probably the DONNEE of the playwas after the Fall.</p>
<p>Indeed, anybody who cares to examine the age of Shakespeare willsee that archaeology was one of its special characteristics.  Afterthat revival of the classical forms of architecture which was oneof the notes of the Renaissance, and the printing at Venice andelsewhere of the masterpieces of Greek and Latin literature, hadcome naturally an interest in the ornamentation and costume of theantique world.  Nor was it for the learning that they couldacquire, but rather for the loveliness that they might create, thatthe artists studied these things.  The curious objects that werebeing constantly brought to light by excavations were not left tomoulder in a museum, for the contemplation of a callous curator,and the ENNUI of a policeman bored by the absence of crime.  Theywere used as motives for the production of a new art, which was tobe not beautiful merely, but also strange.</p>
<p>Infessura tells us that in 1485 some workmen digging on the AppianWay came across an old Roman sarcophagus inscribed with the name&#x27;Julia, daughter of Claudius.&#x27;  On opening the coffer they foundwithin its marble womb the body of a beautiful girl of aboutfifteen years of age, preserved by the embalmer&#x27;s skill fromcorruption and the decay of time.  Her eyes were half open, herhair rippled round her in crisp curling gold, and from her lips andcheek the bloom of maidenhood had not yet departed.  Borne back tothe Capitol, she became at once the centre of a new cult, and fromall parts of the city crowded pilgrims to worship at the wonderfulshrine, till the Pope, fearing lest those who had found the secretof beauty in a Pagan tomb might forget what secrets Judaea&#x27;s roughand rock-hewn sepulchre contained, had the body conveyed away bynight, and in secret buried.  Legend though it may be, yet thestory is none the less valuable as showing us the attitude of theRenaissance towards the antique world.  Archaeology to them was nota mere science for the antiquarian; it was a means by which theycould touch the dry dust of antiquity into the very breath andbeauty of life, and fill with the new wine of romanticism formsthat else had been old and outworn.  From the pulpit of NiccolaPisano down to Mantegna&#x27;s &#x27;Triumph of Caesar,&#x27; and the serviceCellini designed for King Francis, the influence of this spirit canbe traced; nor was it confined merely to the immobile arts - thearts of arrested movement - but its influence was to be seen alsoin the great Graeco-Roman masques which were the constant amusementof the gay courts of the time, and in the public pomps andprocessions with which the citizens of big commercial towns werewont to greet the princes that chanced to visit them; pageants, bythe way, which were considered so important that large prints weremade of them and published - a fact which is a proof of the generalinterest at the time in matters of such kind.</p>
<p>And this use of archaeology in shows, so far from being a bit ofpriggish pedantry, is in every way legitimate and beautiful.  Forthe stage is not merely the meeting-place of all the arts, but isalso the return of art to life.  Sometimes in an archaeologicalnovel the use of strange and obsolete terms seems to hide thereality beneath the learning, and I dare say that many of thereaders of NOTRE DAME DE PARIS have been much puzzled over themeaning of such expressions as LA CASAQUE E MAHOITRES, LESVOULGIERS, LE GALLIMARD TACHE D&#x27;ENCRE, LES CRAAQUINIERS, and thelike; but with the stage how different it is!  The ancient worldwakes from its sleep, and history moves as a pageant before oureyes, without obliging us to have recourse to a dictionary or anencyclopaedia for the perfection of our enjoyment.  Indeed, thereis not the slightest necessity that the public should know theauthorities for the mounting of any piece.  From such materials,for instance, as the disk of Theodosius, materials with which themajority of people are probably not very familiar, Mr. E. W.Godwin, one of the most artistic spirits of this century inEngland, created the marvellous loveliness of the first act ofCLAUDIAN, and showed us the life of Byzantium in the fourthcentury, not by a dreary lecture and a set of grimy casts, not by anovel which requires a glossary to explain it, but by the visiblepresentation before us of all the glory of that great town.  Andwhile the costumes were true to the smallest points of colour anddesign, yet the details were not assigned that abnormal importancewhich they must necessarily be given in a piecemeal lecture, butwere subordinated to the rules of lofty composition and the unityof artistic effect.  Mr. Symonds, speaking of that great picture ofMantegna&#x27;s, now in Hampton Court, says that the artist hasconverted an antiquarian motive into a theme for melodies of line.The same could have been said with equal justice of Mr. Godwin&#x27;sscene.  Only the foolish called it pedantry, only those who wouldneither look nor listen spoke of the passion of the play beingkilled by its paint.  It was in reality a scene not merely perfectin its picturesqueness, but absolutely dramatic also, getting ridof any necessity for tedious descriptions, and showing us, by thecolour and character of Claudian&#x27;s dress, and the dress of hisattendants, the whole nature and life of the man, from what schoolof philosophy he affected, down to what horses he backed on theturf.</p>
<p>And indeed archaeology is only really delightful when transfusedinto some form of art.  I have no desire to underrate the servicesof laborious scholars, but I feel that the use Keats made ofLempriere&#x27;s Dictionary is of far more value to us than ProfessorMax Muller&#x27;s treatment of the same mythology as a disease oflanguage.  Better ENDYMION than any theory, however sound, or, asin the present instance, unsound, of an epidemic among adjectives!And who does not feel that the chief glory of Piranesi&#x27;s book onVases is that it gave Keats the suggestion for his &#x27;Ode on aGrecian Urn&#x27;?  Art, and art only, can make archaeology beautiful;and the theatric art can use it most directly and most vividly, forit can combine in one exquisite presentation the illusion of actuallife with the wonder of the unreal world.  But the sixteenthcentury was not merely the age of Vitruvius; it was the age ofVecellio also.  Every nation seems suddenly to have becomeinterested in the dress of its neighbours.  Europe began toinvestigate its own clothes, and the amount of books published onnational costumes is quite extraordinary.  At the beginning of thecentury the NUREMBERG CHRONICLE, with its two thousandillustrations, reached its fifth edition, and before the centurywas over seventeen editions were published of Munster&#x27;sCOSMOGRAPHY.  Besides these two books there were also the works ofMichael Colyns, of Hans Weigel, of Amman, and of Vecellio himself,all of them well illustrated, some of the drawings in Vecelliobeing probably from the hand of Titian.</p>
<p>Nor was it merely from books and treatises that they acquired theirknowledge.  The development of the habit of foreign travel, theincreased commercial intercourse between countries, and thefrequency of diplomatic missions, gave every nation manyopportunities of studying the various forms of contemporary dress.After the departure from England, for instance, of the ambassadorsfrom the Czar, the Sultan and the Prince of Morocco, Henry theEighth and his friends gave several masques in the strange attireof their visitors.  Later on London saw, perhaps too often, thesombre splendour of the Spanish Court, and to Elizabeth came envoysfrom all lands, whose dress, Shakespeare tells us, had an importantinfluence on English costume.</p>
<p>And the interest was not confined merely to classical dress, or thedress of foreign nations; there was also a good deal of research,amongst theatrical people especially, into the ancient costume ofEngland itself:  and when Shakespeare, in the prologue to one ofhis plays, expresses his regret at being unable to produce helmetsof the period, he is speaking as an Elizabethan manager and notmerely as an Elizabethan poet.  At Cambridge, for instance, duringhis day, a play of RICHARD THE THIRD was performed, in which theactors were attired in real dresses of the time, procured from thegreat collection of historical costume in the Tower, which wasalways open to the inspection of managers, and sometimes placed attheir disposal.  And I cannot help thinking that this performancemust have been far more artistic, as regards costume, thanGarrick&#x27;s mounting of Shakespeare&#x27;s own play on the subject, inwhich he himself appeared in a nondescript fancy dress, andeverybody else in the costume of the time of George the Third,Richmond especially being much admired in the uniform of a youngguardsman.</p>
<p>For what is the use to the stage of that archaeology which has sostrangely terrified the critics, but that it, and it alone, cangive us the architecture and apparel suitable to the time in whichthe action of the play passes?  It enables us to see a Greekdressed like a Greek, and an Italian like an Italian; to enjoy thearcades of Venice and the balconies of Verona; and, if the playdeals with any of the great eras in our country&#x27;s history, tocontemplate the age in its proper attire, and the king in his habitas he lived.  And I wonder, by the way, what Lord Lytton would havesaid some time ago, at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre, had the curtainrisen on his father&#x27;s Brutus reclining in a Queen Anne chair,attired in a flowing wig and a flowered dressing-gown, a costumewhich in the last century was considered peculiarly appropriate toan antique Roman!  For in those halcyon days of the drama noarchaeology troubled the stage, or distressed the critics, and ourinartistic grandfathers sat peaceably in a stifling atmosphere ofanachronisms, and beheld with the calm complacency of the age ofprose an Iachimo in powder and patches, a Lear in lace ruffles, anda Lady Macbeth in a large crinoline.  I can understand archaeologybeing attacked on the ground of its excessive realism, but toattack it as pedantic seems to be very much beside the mark.However, to attack it for any reason is foolish; one might just aswell speak disrespectfully of the equator.  For archaeology, beinga science, is neither good nor bad, but a fact simply.  Its valuedepends entirely on how it is used, and only an artist can use it.We look to the archaeologist for the materials, to the artist forthe method.</p>
<p>In designing the scenery and costumes for any of Shakespeare&#x27;splays, the first thing the artist has to settle is the best datefor the drama.  This should be determined by the general spirit ofthe play, more than by any actual historical references which mayoccur in it.  Most HAMLETS I have seen were placed far too early.HAMLET is essentially a scholar of the Revival of Learning; and ifthe allusion to the recent invasion of England by the Danes puts itback to the ninth century, the use of foils brings it down muchlater.  Once, however, that the date has been fixed, then thearchaeologist is to supply us with the facts which the artist is toconvert into effects.</p>
<p>It has been said that the anachronisms in the plays themselves showus that Shakespeare was indifferent to historical accuracy, and agreat deal of capital has been made out of Hector&#x27;s indiscreetquotation from Aristotle.  Upon the other hand, the anachronismsare really few in number, and not very important, and, hadShakespeare&#x27;s attention been drawn to them by a brother artist, hewould probably have corrected them.  For, though they can hardly becalled blemishes, they are certainly not the great beauties of hiswork; or, at least, if they are, their anachronistic charm cannotbe emphasised unless the play is accurately mounted according toits proper date.  In looking at Shakespeare&#x27;s plays as a whole,however, what is really remarkable is their extraordinary fidelityas regards his personages and his plots.  Many of his DRAMATISPERSONAE are people who had actually existed, and some of themmight have been seen in real life by a portion of his audience.Indeed the most violent attack that was made on Shakespeare in histime was for his supposed caricature of Lord Cobham.  As for hisplots, Shakespeare constantly draws them either from authentichistory, or from the old ballads and traditions which served ashistory to the Elizabethan public, and which even now no scientifichistorian would dismiss as absolutely untrue.  And not merely didhe select fact instead of fancy as the basis of much of hisimaginative work, but he always gives to each play the generalcharacter, the social atmosphere in a word, of the age in question.Stupidity he recognises as being one of the permanentcharacteristics of all European civilisations; so he sees nodifference between a London mob of his own day and a Roman mob ofpagan days, between a silly watchman in Messina and a silly Justiceof the Peace in Windsor.  But when he deals with higher characters,with those exceptions of each age which are so fine that theybecome its types, he gives them absolutely the stamp and seal oftheir time.  Virgilia is one of those Roman wives on whose tomb waswritten &#x27;Domi mansit, lanam fecit,&#x27; as surely as Juliet is theromantic girl of the Renaissance.  He is even true to thecharacteristics of race.  Hamlet has all the imagination andirresolution of the Northern nations, and the Princess Katharine isas entirely French as the heroine of DIVORCONS.  Harry the Fifth isa pure Englishman, and Othello a true Moor.</p>
<p>Again when Shakespeare treats of the history of England from thefourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, it is wonderful how carefulhe is to have his facts perfectly right - indeed he followsHolinshed with curious fidelity.  The incessant wars between Franceand England are described with extraordinary accuracy down to thenames of the besieged towns, the ports of landing and embarkation,the sites and dates of the battles, the titles of the commanders oneach side, and the lists of the killed and wounded.  And as regardsthe Civil Wars of the Roses we have many elaborate genealogies ofthe seven sons of Edward the Third; the claims of the rival Housesof York and Lancaster to the throne are discussed at length; and ifthe English aristocracy will not read Shakespeare as a poet, theyshould certainly read him as a sort of early Peerage.  There ishardly a single title in the Upper House, with the exception ofcourse of the uninteresting titles assumed by the law lords, whichdoes not appear in Shakespeare along with many details of familyhistory, creditable and discreditable.  Indeed if it be reallynecessary that the School Board children should know all about theWars of the Roses, they could learn their lessons just as well outof Shakespeare as out of shilling primers, and learn them, I neednot say, far more pleasurably.  Even in Shakespeare&#x27;s own day thisuse of his plays was recognised.  &#x27;The historical plays teachhistory to those who cannot read it in the chronicles,&#x27; saysHeywood in a tract about the stage, and yet I am sure thatsixteenth-century chronicles were much more delightful reading thannineteenth-century primers are.</p>
<p>Of course the aesthetic value of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays does not, inthe slightest degree, depend on their facts, but on their Truth,and Truth is independent of facts always, inventing or selectingthem at pleasure.  But still Shakespeare&#x27;s use of facts is a mostinteresting part of his method of work, and shows us his attitudetowards the stage, and his relations to the great art of illusion.Indeed he would have been very much surprised at any one classinghis plays with &#x27;fairy tales,&#x27; as Lord Lytton does; for one of hisaims was to create for England a national historical drama, whichshould deal with incidents with which the public was wellacquainted, and with heroes that lived in the memory of a people.Patriotism, I need hardly say, is not a necessary quality of art;but it means, for the artist, the substitution of a universal foran individual feeling, and for the public the presentation of awork of art in a most attractive and popular form.  It is worthnoticing that Shakespeare&#x27;s first and last successes were bothhistorical plays.</p>
<p>It may be asked, what has this to do with Shakespeare&#x27;s attitudetowards costume?  I answer that a dramatist who laid such stress onhistorical accuracy of fact would have welcomed historical accuracyof costume as a most important adjunct to his illusionist method.And I have no hesitation in saying that he did so.  The referenceto helmets of the period in the prologue to HENRY THE FIFTH may beconsidered fanciful, though Shakespeare must have often seen</p>
<p>The very casqueThat did affright the air at Agincourt,</p>
<p>where it still hangs in the dusky gloom of Westminster Abbey, alongwith the saddle of that &#x27;imp of fame,&#x27; and the dinted shield withits torn blue velvet lining and its tarnished lilies of gold; butthe use of military tabards in HENRY THE SIXTH is a bit of purearchaeology, as they were not worn in the sixteenth century; andthe King&#x27;s own tabard, I may mention, was still suspended over histomb in St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, in Shakespeare&#x27;s day.  For,up to the time of the unfortunate triumph of the Philistines in1645, the chapels and cathedrals of England were the great nationalmuseums of archaeology, and in them were kept the armour and attireof the heroes of English history.  A good deal was of coursepreserved in the Tower, and even in Elizabeth&#x27;s day tourists werebrought there to see such curious relics of the past as CharlesBrandon&#x27;s huge lance, which is still, I believe, the admiration ofour country visitors; but the cathedrals and churches were, as arule, selected as the most suitable shrines for the reception ofthe historic antiquities.  Canterbury can still show us the helm ofthe Black Prince, Westminster the robes of our kings, and in oldSt. Paul&#x27;s the very banner that had waved on Bosworth field washung up by Richmond himself.</p>
<p>In fact, everywhere that Shakespeare turned in London, he saw theapparel and appurtenances of past ages, and it is impossible todoubt that he made use of his opportunities.  The employment oflance and shield, for instance, in actual warfare, which is sofrequent in his plays, is drawn from archaeology, and not from themilitary accoutrements of his day; and his general use of armour inbattle was not a characteristic of his age, a time when it wasrapidly disappearing before firearms.  Again, the crest onWarwick&#x27;s helmet, of which such a point is made in HENRY THE SIXTH,is absolutely correct in a fifteenth-century play when crests weregenerally worn, but would not have been so in a play ofShakespeare&#x27;s own time, when feathers and plumes had taken theirplace - a fashion which, as he tells us in HENRY THE EIGHTH, wasborrowed from France.  For the historical plays, then, we may besure that archaeology was employed, and as for the others I feelcertain that it was the case also.  The appearance of Jupiter onhis eagle, thunderbolt in hand, of Juno with her peacocks, and ofIris with her many-coloured bow; the Amazon masque and the masqueof the Five Worthies, may all be regarded as archaeological; andthe vision which Posthumus sees in prison of Sicilius Leonatus -&#x27;an old man, attired like a warrior, leading an ancient matron&#x27; -is clearly so.  Of the &#x27;Athenian dress&#x27; by which Lysander isdistinguished from Oberon I have already spoken; but one of themost marked instances is in the case of the dress of Coriolanus,for which Shakespeare goes directly to Plutarch.  That historian,in his Life of the great Roman, tells us of the oak-wreath withwhich Caius Marcius was crowned, and of the curious kind of dressin which, according to ancient fashion, he had to canvass hiselectors; and on both of these points he enters into longdisquisitions, investigating the origin and meaning of the oldcustoms.  Shakespeare, in the spirit of the true artist, acceptsthe facts of the antiquarian and converts them into dramatic andpicturesque effects:  indeed the gown of humility, the &#x27;woolvishgown,&#x27; as Shakespeare calls it, is the central note of the play.There are other cases I might quote, but this one is quitesufficient for my purpose; and it is evident from it at any ratethat, in mounting a play in the accurate costume of the time,according to the best authorities, we are carrying outShakespeare&#x27;s own wishes and method.</p>
<p>Even if it were not so, there is no more reason that we shouldcontinue any imperfections which may be supposed to havecharacterised Shakespeare&#x27;s stage mounting than that we should haveJuliet played by a young man, or give up the advantage ofchangeable scenery.  A great work of dramatic art should not merelybe made expressive of modern passion by means of the actor, butshould be presented to us in the form most suitable to the modernspirit.  Racine produced his Roman plays in Louis Quatorze dress ona stage crowded with spectators; but we require differentconditions for the enjoyment of his art.  Perfect accuracy ofdetail, for the sake of perfect illusion, is necessary for us.What we have to see is that the details are not allowed to usurpthe principal place.  They must be subordinate always to thegeneral motive of the play.  But subordination in art does not meandisregard of truth; it means conversion of fact into effect, andassigning to each detail its proper relative value</p>
<p>&#x27;Les petits details d&#x27;histoire et de vie domestique (says Hugo)doivent etre scrupuleusement etudies et reproduits par le poete,mais uniquement comme des moyens d&#x27;accroitre la realite del&#x27;ensemble, et de faire penetrer jusque dans les coins les plusobscurs de l&#x27;oeuvre cette vie generale et puissante au milieu delaquelle les personnages sont plus vrais, et les catastrophes, parconsequeut, plus poignantes.  Tout doit etre subordonne e ce but.L&#x27;Homme sur le premier plan, le reste au fond.&#x27;</p>
<p>This passage is interesting as coming from the first great Frenchdramatist who employed archaeology on the stage, and whose plays,though absolutely correct in detail, are known to all for theirpassion, not for their pedantry - for their life, not for theirlearning.  It is true that he has made certain concessions in thecase of the employment of curious or strange expressions.  Ruy Blastalks of M, de Priego as &#x27;sujet du roi&#x27; instead of &#x27;noble du roi,&#x27;and Angelo Malipieri speaks of &#x27;la croix rouge&#x27; instead of &#x27;lacroix de gueules.&#x27;  But they are concessions made to the public, orrather to a section of it.  &#x27;J&#x27;en offre ici toute mes excuses auxspectateurs intelligents,&#x27; he says in a note to one of the plays;&#x27;esperons qu&#x27;un jour un seigneur venitien pourra dire toutbonnement sans peril son blason sur le theatre.  C&#x27;est un progresqui viendra.&#x27;  And, though the description of the crest is notcouched in accurate language, still the crest itself was accuratelyright.  It may, of course, be said that the public do not noticethese things; upon the other hand, it should be remembered that Arthas no other aim but her own perfection, and proceeds simply by herown laws, and that the play which Hamlet describes as being caviareto the general is a play he highly praises.  Besides, in England,at any rate, the public have undergone a transformation; there isfar more appreciation of beauty now than there was a few years ago;and though they may not be familiar with the authorities andarchaeological data for what is shown to them, still they enjoywhatever loveliness they look at.  And this is the important thing.Better to take pleasure in a rose than to put its root under amicroscope.  Archaeological accuracy is merely a condition ofillusionist stage effect; it is not its quality.  And Lord Lytton&#x27;sproposal that the dresses should merely be beautiful without beingaccurate is founded on a misapprehension of the nature of costume,and of its value on the stage.  This value is twofold, picturesqueand dramatic; the former depends on the colour of the dress, thelatter on its design and character.  But so interwoven are the twothat, whenever in our own day historical accuracy has beendisregarded, and the various dresses in a play taken from differentages, the result has been that the stage has been turned into thatchaos of costume, that caricature of the centuries, the Fancy DressBall, to the entire ruin of all dramatic and picturesque effect.For the dresses of one age do not artistically harmonise with thedresses of another:  and, as far as dramatic value goes, to confusethe costumes is to confuse the play.  Costume is a growth, anevolution, and a most important, perhaps the most important, signof the manners, customs and mode of life of each century.  ThePuritan dislike of colour, adornment and grace in apparel was partof the great revolt of the middle classes against Beauty in theseventeenth century.  A historian who disregarded it would give usa most inaccurate picture of the time, and a dramatist who did notavail himself of it would miss a most vital element in producing anillusionist effect.  The effeminacy of dress that characterised thereign of Richard the Second was a constant theme of contemporaryauthors.  Shakespeare, writing two hundred years after, makes theking&#x27;s fondness for gay apparel and foreign fashions a point in theplay, from John of Gaunt&#x27;s reproaches down to Richard&#x27;s own speechin the third act on his deposition from the throne.  And thatShakespeare examined Richard&#x27;s tomb in Westminster Abbey seems tome certain from York&#x27;s speech:-</p>
<p>See, see, King Richard doth himself appearAs doth the blushing discontented sunFrom out the fiery portal of the east,When he perceives the envious clouds are bentTo dim his glory.</p>
<p>For we can still discern on the King&#x27;s robe his favourite badge -the sun issuing from a cloud.  In fact, in every age the socialconditions are so exemplified in costume, that to produce asixteenth-century play in fourteenth-century attire, or VICE VERSA,would make the performance seem unreal because untrue.  And,valuable as beauty of effect on the stage is, the highest beauty isnot merely comparable with absolute accuracy of detail, but reallydependent on it.  To invent, an entirely new costume is almostimpossible except in burlesque or extravaganza, and as forcombining the dress of different centuries into one, the experimentwould be dangerous, and Shakespeare&#x27;s opinion of the artistic valueof such a medley may be gathered from his incessant satire of theElizabethan dandies for imagining that they were well dressedbecause they got their doublets in Italy, their hats in Germany,and their hose in France.  And it should be noted that the mostlovely scenes that have been produced on our stage have been thosethat have been characterised by perfect accuracy, such as Mr. andMrs. Bancroft&#x27;s eighteenth-century revivals at the Haymarket, Mr.Irying&#x27;s superb production of MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and Mr,Barrett&#x27;s CLAUDIAN.  Besides, and this is perhaps the most completeanswer to Lord Lytton&#x27;s theory, it must be remembered that neitherin costume nor in dialogue is beauty the dramatist&#x27;s primary aim atall.  The true dramatist aims first at what is characteristic, andno more desires that all his personages should be beautifullyattired than he desires that they should all have beautiful naturesor speak beautiful English.  The true dramatist, in fact, shows uslife under the conditions of art, not art in the form of life.  TheGreek dress was the loveliest dress the world has ever seen, andthe English dress of the last century one of the most monstrous;yet we cannot costume a play by Sheridan as we would costume a playby Sophokles.  For, as Polonius says in his excellent lecture, alecture to which I am glad to have the opportunity of expressing myobligations, one of the first qualities of apparel is itsexpressiveness.  And the affected style of dress in the lastcentury was the natural characteristic of a society of affectedmanners and affected conversation - a characteristic which therealistic dramatist will highly value down to the smallest detailof accuracy, and the materials for which he can get only fromarchaeology.</p>
<p>But it is not enough that a dress should be accurate; it must bealso appropriate to the stature and appearance of the actor, and tohis supposed condition, as well as to his necessary action in theplay.  In Mr. Hare&#x27;s production OF AS YOU LIKE IT at the St.James&#x27;s Theatre, for instance, the whole point of Orlando&#x27;scomplaint that he is brought up like a peasant, and not like agentleman, was spoiled by the gorgeousness of his dress, and thesplendid apparel worn by the banished Duke and his friends wasquite out of place.  Mr. Lewis Wingfield&#x27;s explanation that thesumptuary laws of the period necessitated their doing so, is, I amafraid, hardly sufficient.  Outlaws, lurking in a forest and livingby the chase, are not very likely to care much about ordinances ofdress.  They were probably attired like Robin Hood&#x27;s men, to whom,indeed, they are compared in the course of the play.  And thattheir dress was not that of wealthy noblemen may be seen byOrlando&#x27;s words when he breaks in upon them.  He mistakes them forrobbers, and is amazed to find that they answer him in courteousand gentle terms.  Lady Archibald Campbell&#x27;s production, under Mr.E. W. Godwin&#x27;s direction, of the same play in Coombe Wood was, asregards mounting, far more artistic.  At least it seemed so to me.The Duke and his companions were dressed in serge tunics, leathernjerkins, high boots and gauntlets, and wore bycocket hats andhoods.  And as they were playing in a real forest, they found, I amsure, their dresses extremely convenient.  To every character inthe play was given a perfectly appropriate attire, and the brownand green of their costumes harmonised exquisitely with the fernsthrough which they wandered, the trees beneath which they lay, andthe lovely English landscape that surrounded the Pastoral Players.The perfect naturalness of the scene was due to the absoluteaccuracy and appropriateness of everything that was worn.  Norcould archaeology have been put to a severer test, or come out ofit more triumphantly.  The whole production showed once for allthat, unless a dress is archaeologically correct, and artisticallyappropriate, it always looks unreal, unnatural, and theatrical inthe sense of artificial.</p>
<p>Nor, again, is it enough that there should be accurate andappropriate costumes of beautiful colours; there must be alsobeauty of colour on the stage as a whole, and as long as thebackground is painted by one artist, and the foreground figuresindependently designed by another, there is the danger of a want ofharmony in the scene as a picture.  For each scene the colour-scheme should be settled as absolutely as for the decoration of aroom, and the textures which it is proposed to use should be mixedand re-mixed in every possible combination, and what is discordantremoved.  Then, as regards the particular kinds of colours, thestage is often too glaring, partly through the excessive use ofhot, violent reds, and partly through the costumes looking too new.Shabbiness, which in modern life is merely the tendency of thelower orders towards tone, is not without its artistic value, andmodern colours are often much improved by being a little faded.Blue also is too frequently used:  it is not merely a dangerouscolour to wear by gaslight, but it is really difficult in Englandto get a thoroughly good blue.  The fine Chinese blue, which we allso much admire, takes two years to dye, and the English public willnot wait so long for a colour.  Peacock blue, of course, has beenemployed on the stage, notably at the Lyceum, with great advantage;but all attempts at a good light blue, or good dark blue, which Ihave seen have been failures.  The value of black is hardlyappreciated; it was used effectively by Mr. Irving in HAMLET as thecentral note of a composition, but as a tone-giving neutral itsimportance is not recognised.  And this is curious, considering thegeneral colour of the dress of a century in which, as Baudelairesays, &#x27;Nous celebrons tous quelque enterrement.&#x27;  The archaeologistof the future will probably point to this age as the time when thebeauty of black was understood; but I hardly think that, as regardsstage-mounting or house decoration, it really is.  Its decorativevalue is, of course, the same as that of white or gold; it canseparate and harmonise colours.  In modern plays the black frock-coat of the hero becomes important in itself, and should be given asuitable background.  But it rarely is.  Indeed the only goodbackground for a play in modern dress which I have ever seen wasthe dark grey and cream-white scene of the first act of thePRINCESSE GEORGES in Mrs. Langtry&#x27;s production.  As a rule, thehero is smothered in BRIC-E-BRAC and palm-trees, lost in the gildedabyss of Louis Quatorze furniture, or reduced to a mere midge inthe midst of marqueterie; whereas the background should always bekept as a background, and colour subordinated to effect.  This, ofcourse, can only be done when there is one single mind directingthe whole production.  The facts of art are diverse, but theessence of artistic effect is unity.  Monarchy, Anarchy, andRepublicanism may contend for the government of nations; but atheatre should be in the power of a cultured despot.  There may bedivision of labour, but there must be no division of mind.  Whoeverunderstands the costume of an age understands of necessity itsarchitecture and its surroundings also, and it is easy to see fromthe chairs of a century whether it was a century of crinolines ornot.  In fact, in art there is no specialism, and a really artisticproduction should bear the impress of one master, and one masteronly, who not merely should design and arrange everything, butshould have complete control over the way in which each dress is tobe worn.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Mars, in the first production of HERNANI, absolutelyrefused to call her lover &#x27;MON LION!&#x27; unless she was allowed towear a little fashionable TOQUE then much in vogue on theBoulevards; and many young ladies on our own stage insist to thepresent day on wearing stiff starched petticoats under Greekdresses, to the entire ruin of all delicacy of line and fold; butthese wicked things should not be allowed.  And there should be farmore dress rehearsals than there are now.  Actors such as Mr.Forbes-Robertson, Mr. Conway, Mr. George Alexander, and others, notto mention older artists, can move with ease and elegance in theattire of any century; but there are not a few who seem dreadfullyembarrassed about their hands if they have no side pockets, and whoalways wear their dresses as if they were costumes.  Costumes, ofcourse, they are to the designer; but dresses they should be tothose that wear them.  And it is time that a stop should be put tothe idea, very prevalent on the stage, that the Greeks and Romansalways went about bareheaded in the open air - a mistake theElizabethan managers did not fall into, for they gave hoods as wellas gowns to their Roman senators.</p>
<p>More dress rehearsals would also be of value in explaining to theactors that there is a form of gesture and movement that is notmerely appropriate to each style of dress, but really conditionedby it.  The extravagant use of the arms in the eighteenth century,for instance, was the necessary result of the large hoop, and thesolemn dignity of Burleigh owed as much to his ruff as to hisreason.  Besides until an actor is at home in his dress, he is notat home in his part.</p>
<p>Of the value of beautiful costume in creating an artistictemperament in the audience, and producing that joy in beauty forbeauty&#x27;s sake without which the great masterpieces of art can neverbe understood, I will not here speak; though it is worth while tonotice how Shakespeare appreciated that side of the question in theproduction of his tragedies, acting them always by artificiallight, and in a theatre hung with black; but what I have tried topoint out is that archaeology is not a pedantic method, but amethod of artistic illusion, and that costume is a means ofdisplaying character without description, and of producing dramaticsituations and dramatic effects.  And I think it is a pity that somany critics should have set themselves to attack one of the mostimportant movements on the modern stage before that movement has atall reached its proper perfection.  That it will do so, however, Ifeel as certain as that we shall require from our dramatic criticsin the future higher qualification than that they can rememberMacready or have seen Benjamin Webster; we shall require of them,indeed, that they cultivate a sense of beauty.  POUR ETRE PLUSDIFFICILE, LA TACHE N&#x27;EN EST QUE PLUS GLORIEUSE.  And if they willnot encourage, at least they must not oppose, a movement of whichShakespeare of all dramatists would have most approved, for it hasthe illusion of truth for its method, and the illusion of beautyfor its result.  Not that I agree with everything that I have saidin this essay.  There is much with which I entirely disagree.  Theessay simply represents an artistic standpoint, and in aestheticcriticism attitude is everything.  For in art there is no suchthing as a universal truth.  A Truth in art is that whosecontradictory is also true.  And just as it is only in art-criticism, and through it, that we can apprehend the Platonictheory of ideas, so it is only in art-criticism, and through it,that we can realise Hegel&#x27;s system of contraries.  The truths ofmetaphysics are the truths of masks.</p>
