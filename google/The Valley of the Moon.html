<p>BOOK I</p>
<p>CHAPTER 1</p>
<p>&quot;You hear me, Saxon? Come on along. What if it is the</p>
<p>Bricklayers? I&#x27;ll have gentlemen friends there, and so&#x27;ll you.</p>
<p>The Al Vista band&#x27;ll be along, an&#x27; you know it plays heavenly.</p>
<p>An&#x27; you just love dancin&#x27;---&quot;</p>
<p>Twenty feet away, a stout, elderly woman interrupted the girl&#x27;s</p>
<p>persuasions. The elderly woman&#x27;s back was turned, and the</p>
<p>back-loose, bulging, and misshapen--began a convulsive heaving.</p>
<p>&quot;Gawd!&quot; she cried out. &quot;O Gawd!&quot;</p>
<p>She flung wild glances, like those of an entrapped animal, up and</p>
<p>down the big whitewashed room that panted with heat and that was</p>
<p>thickly humid with the steam that sizzled from the damp cloth</p>
<p>under the irons of the many ironers. From the girls and women</p>
<p>near her, all swinging irons steadily but at high pace, came</p>
<p>quick glances, and labor efficiency suffered to the extent of a</p>
<p>score of suspended or inadequate movements. The elderly woman&#x27;s</p>
<p>cry had caused a tremor of money-loss to pass among the</p>
<p>piece-work ironers of fancy starch.</p>
<p>She gripped herself and her iron with a visible effort, and</p>
<p>dabbed futilely at the frail, frilled garment on the board under</p>
<p>her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought she&#x27;d got&#x27;em again--didn&#x27;t you?&quot; the girl said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a shame, a women of her age, and . . . condition,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>answered, as she frilled a lace ruffle with a hot fluting-iron.</p>
<p>Her movements were delicate, safe, and swift, and though her face</p>
<p>was wan with fatigue and exhausting heat, there was no slackening</p>
<p>in her pace.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; her with seven, an&#x27; two of &#x27;em in reform school,&quot; the girl</p>
<p>at the next board sniffed sympathetic agreement. &quot;But you just</p>
<p>got to come to Weasel Park to-morrow, Saxon. The Bricklayers&#x27; is</p>
<p>always lively--tugs-of-war, fat-man races, real Irish jiggin&#x27;,</p>
<p>an&#x27; . . . an&#x27; everything. An&#x27; The floor of the pavilion&#x27;s swell.&quot;</p>
<p>But the elderly woman brought another interruption. She dropped</p>
<p>her iron on the shirtwaist, clutched at the board, fumbled it,</p>
<p>caved in at the knees and hips, and like a half-empty sack</p>
<p>collapsed on the floor, her long shriek rising in the pent room</p>
<p>to the acrid smell of scorching cloth. The women at the boards</p>
<p>near to her scrambled, first, to the hot iron to save the cloth,</p>
<p>and then to her, while the forewoman hurried belligerently down</p>
<p>the aisle. The women farther away continued unsteadily at their</p>
<p>work, losing movements to the extent of a minute&#x27;s set-back to</p>
<p>the totality of the efficiency of the fancy-starch room.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough to kill a dog,&quot; the girl muttered, thumping her iron down</p>
<p>on its rest with reckless determination. &quot;Workin&#x27; girls&#x27; life</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t what it&#x27;s cracked up. Me to quit--that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m comin&#x27;</p>
<p>to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mary!&quot; Saxon uttered the other&#x27;s name with a reproach so</p>
<p>profound that she was compelled to rest her own iron for emphasis</p>
<p>and so lose a dozen movements.</p>
<p>Mary flashed a half-frightened look across.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t mean it, Saxon,&quot; she whimpered. &quot;Honest, I didn&#x27;t. I</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t never go that way. But I leave it to you, if a day like</p>
<p>this don&#x27;t get on anybody&#x27;s nerves. Listen to that!&quot;</p>
<p>The stricken woman, on her back, drumming her heels on the floor,</p>
<p>was shrieking persistently and monotonously, like a mechanical</p>
<p>siren. Two women, clutching her under the arms, were dragging her</p>
<p>down the aisle. She drummed and shrieked the length of it. The</p>
<p>door opened, and a vast, muffled roar of machinery burst in; and</p>
<p>in the roar of it the drumming and the shrieking were drowned ere</p>
<p>the door swung shut. Remained of the episode only the scorch of</p>
<p>cloth drifting ominously through the air.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s sickenin&#x27;,&quot; said Mary.</p>
<p>And thereafter, for a long time, the many irons rose and fell,</p>
<p>the pace of the room in no wise diminished; while the forewoman</p>
<p>strode the aisles with a threatening eye for incipient breakdown</p>
<p>and hysteria. Occasionally an ironer lost the stride for an</p>
<p>instant, gasped or sighed, then caught it up again with weary</p>
<p>determination. The long summer day waned, hut not the heat, and</p>
<p>under the raw flare of electric light the work went on.</p>
<p>By nine o&#x27;clock the first women began to go home. The mountain of</p>
<p>fancy starch had been demolished--all save the few remnants, here</p>
<p>and there, on the boards, where the ironers still labored.</p>
<p>Saxon finished ahead of Mary, at whose board she paused on the</p>
<p>way out.</p>
<p>&quot;Saturday night an&#x27; another week gone,&quot; Mary said mournfully, her</p>
<p>young cheeks pallid and hollowed, her black eyes blue-shadowed</p>
<p>and tired. &quot;What d&#x27;you think you&#x27;ve made, Saxon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twelve and a quarter,&quot; was the answer, just touched with pride</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#x27;d a-made more if it wasn&#x27;t for that fake bunch of</p>
<p>starchers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My! I got to pass it to you,&quot; Mary congratulated. &quot;You&#x27;re a sure</p>
<p>fierce hustler--just eat it up. Me--I&#x27;ve only ten an&#x27; a half, an&#x27;</p>
<p>for a hard week ... See you on the nine-forty. Sure now. We can</p>
<p>just fool around until the dancin&#x27; begins. A lot of my gentlemen</p>
<p>friends&#x27;ll be there in the afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>Two blocks from the laundry, where an arc-light showed a gang of</p>
<p>toughs on the corner, Saxon quickened her pace. Unconsciously her</p>
<p>face set and hardened as she passed. She did not catch the words</p>
<p>of the muttered comment, but the rough laughter it raised made</p>
<p>her guess and warmed her checks with resentful blood. Three</p>
<p>blocks more, turning once to left and once to right, she walked</p>
<p>on through the night that was already growing cool. On either</p>
<p>side were workingmen&#x27;s houses, of weathered wood, the ancient</p>
<p>paint grimed with the dust of years, conspicuous only for</p>
<p>cheapness and ugliness.</p>
<p>Dark it was, but she made no mistake, the familiar sag and</p>
<p>screeching reproach of the front gate welcome under her hand. She</p>
<p>went along the narrow walk to the rear, avoided the missing step</p>
<p>without thinking about it, and entered the kitchen, where a</p>
<p>solitary gas-jet flickered. She turned it up to the best of its</p>
<p>flame. It was a small room, not disorderly, because of lack of</p>
<p>furnishings to disorder it. The plaster, discolored by the steam</p>
<p>of many wash-days, was crisscrossed with cracks from the big</p>
<p>earthquake of the previous spring. The floor was ridged,</p>
<p>wide-cracked, and uneven, and in front of the stove it was worn</p>
<p>through and repaired with a five-gallon oil-can hammered flat and</p>
<p>double. A sink, a dirty roller-towel, several chairs, and a</p>
<p>wooden table completed the picture.</p>
<p>An apple-core crunched under her foot as she drew a chair to the</p>
<p>table. On the frayed oilcloth, a supper waited. She attempted the</p>
<p>cold beans, thick with grease, but gave them up, and buttered a</p>
<p>slice of bread.</p>
<p>The rickety house shook to a heavy, prideless tread, and through</p>
<p>the inner door came Sarah, middle-aged, lop-breasted,</p>
<p>hair-tousled, her face lined with care and fat petulance.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh, it&#x27;s you,&quot; she grunted a greeting. &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t keep</p>
<p>things warm. Such a day! I near died of the heat. An&#x27; little</p>
<p>Henry cut his lip awful. The doctor had to put four stitches in</p>
<p>it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarah came over and stood mountainously by the table.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the matter with them beans?&quot; she challenged.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, only ...&quot; Saxon caught her breath and avoided the</p>
<p>threatened outburst. &quot;Only I&#x27;m not hungry. It&#x27;s been so hot all</p>
<p>day. It was terrible in the laundry.&quot;</p>
<p>Recklessly she took a mouthful of the cold tea that had been</p>
<p>steeped so long that it was like acid in her mouth, and</p>
<p>recklessly, under the eye of her sister-in-law, she swallowed it</p>
<p>and the rest of the cupful. She wiped her mouth on her</p>
<p>handkerchief and got up.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I&#x27;ll go to bed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wonder you ain&#x27;t out to a dance,&quot; Sarah sniffed. &quot;Funny, ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>it, you come home so dead tired every night, an&#x27; yet any night in</p>
<p>the week you can get out an&#x27; dance unearthly hours.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon started to speak, suppressed herself with tightened lips,</p>
<p>then lost control and blazed out. &quot;Wasn&#x27;t you ever young?&quot;</p>
<p>Without waiting for reply, she turned to her bedroom, which</p>
<p>opened directly off the kitchen. It was a small room, eight by</p>
<p>twelve, and the earthquake had left its marks upon the plaster. A</p>
<p>bed and chair of cheap pine and a very ancient chest of drawers</p>
<p>constituted the furniture. Saxon had known this chest of drawers</p>
<p>all her life. The vision of it was woven into her earliest</p>
<p>recollections. She knew it had crossed the plains with her people</p>
<p>in a prairie schooner. It was of solid mahogany. One end was</p>
<p>cracked and dented from the capsize of the wagon in Rock Canyon.</p>
<p>A bullet-hole, plugged, in the face of the top drawer, told of</p>
<p>the fight with the Indians at Little Meadow. Of these happenings</p>
<p>her mother had told her; also had she told that the chest had</p>
<p>come with the family originally from England in a day even</p>
<p>earlier than the day on which George Washington was born.</p>
<p>Above the chest of drawers, on the wall, hung a small</p>
<p>looking-glass. Thrust under the molding were photographs of young</p>
<p>men and women, and of picnic groups wherein the young men, with</p>
<p>hats rakishly on the backs of their heads, encircled the girls</p>
<p>with their arms. Farther along on the wall were a colored</p>
<p>calendar and numerous colored advertisements and sketches torn</p>
<p>out of magazines. Most of these sketches were of horses. From the</p>
<p>gas-fixture hung a tangled bunch of well-scribbled dance</p>
<p>programs.</p>
<p>Saxon started to take off her hat, but suddenly sat down on the</p>
<p>bed. She sobbed softly, with considered repression, but the</p>
<p>weak-latched door swung noiselessly open, and she was startled by</p>
<p>her sister-in-law&#x27;s voice.</p>
<p>&quot;NOW what&#x27;s the matter with you? If you didn&#x27;t like them beans--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; Saxon explained hurriedly. &quot;I&#x27;m just tired, that&#x27;s all,</p>
<p>and my feet hurt. I wasn&#x27;t hungry, Sarah. I&#x27;m just beat out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you took care of this house,&quot; came the retort, &quot;an&#x27; cooked</p>
<p>an&#x27; baked, an&#x27; washed, an&#x27; put up with what I put up, you&#x27;d have</p>
<p>something to be beat out about. You&#x27;ve got a snap, you have. But</p>
<p>just wait.&quot; Sarah broke off to cackle gloatingly. &quot;Just wait,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s all, an&#x27; you&#x27;ll be fool enough to get married some day,</p>
<p>like me, an&#x27; then you&#x27;ll get yours--an&#x27; it&#x27;ll be brats, an&#x27;</p>
<p>brats, an&#x27; brats, an&#x27; no more dancin&#x27;, an&#x27; silk stockin&#x27;s, an&#x27;</p>
<p>three pairs of shoes at one time. You&#x27;ve got a cinch-nobody to</p>
<p>think of but your own precious self--an&#x27; a lot of young hoodlums</p>
<p>makin&#x27; eyes at you an&#x27; tellin&#x27; you how beautiful your eyes are.</p>
<p>Huh! Some fine day you&#x27;ll tie up to one of &#x27;em, an&#x27; then, mebbe,</p>
<p>on occasion, you&#x27;ll wear black eyes for a change.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t say that, Sarah,&quot; Saxon protested. &quot;My brother never laid</p>
<p>hands on you. You know that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No more he didn&#x27;t. He never had the gumption. Just the same,</p>
<p>he&#x27;s better stock than that tough crowd you run with, if he can&#x27;t</p>
<p>make a livin&#x27; an&#x27; keep his wife in three pairs of shoes. Just the</p>
<p>same he&#x27;s oodles better&#x27;n your bunch of hoodlums that no decent</p>
<p>woman&#x27;d wipe her one pair of shoes on. How you&#x27;ve missed trouble</p>
<p>this long is beyond me. Mebbe the younger generation is wiser in</p>
<p>such thins--I don&#x27;t know. But I do know that a young woman that</p>
<p>has three pairs of shoes ain&#x27;t thinkin&#x27; of anything but her own</p>
<p>enjoyment, an&#x27; she&#x27;s goin&#x27; to get hers, I can tell her that much.</p>
<p>When I was a girl there wasn&#x27;t such doin&#x27;s. My mother&#x27;d taken the</p>
<p>hide off me if I done the things you do. An&#x27; she was right, just</p>
<p>as everything in the world is wrong now. Look at your brother,</p>
<p>a-runnin&#x27; around to socialist meetin&#x27;s, an&#x27; chewin&#x27; hot air, an&#x27;</p>
<p>diggin&#x27; up extra strike dues to the union that means so much</p>
<p>bread out of the mouths of his children, instead of makin&#x27; good</p>
<p>with his bosses. Why, the dues he pays would keep me in seventeen</p>
<p>pairs of shoes if I was nannygoat enough to want &#x27;em. Some day,</p>
<p>mark my words, he&#x27;ll get his time, an&#x27; then what&#x27;ll we do?</p>
<p>What&#x27;ll I do, with five mouths to feed an&#x27; nothin&#x27; comin&#x27; in?&quot;</p>
<p>She stopped, out of breath but seething with the tirade yet to</p>
<p>come.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Sarah, please won&#x27;t you shut the door?&quot; Saxon pleaded.</p>
<p>The door slammed violently, and Saxon, ere she fell to crying</p>
<p>again, could hear her sister-in-law lumbering about the kitchen</p>
<p>and talking loudly to herself.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>Each bought her own ticket at the entrance to Weasel Park. And</p>
<p>each, as she laid her half-dollar down, was distinctly aware of</p>
<p>how many pieces of fancy starch were represented by the coin. It</p>
<p>was too early for the crowd, but bricklayers and their families,</p>
<p>laden with huge lunch-baskets and armfuls of babies, were already</p>
<p>going in--a healthy, husky race of workmen, well-paid and</p>
<p>robustly fed. And with them, here and there, undisguised by their</p>
<p>decent American clothing, smaller in bulk and stature, weazened</p>
<p>not alone by age but by the pinch of lean years and early</p>
<p>hardship, were grandfathers and mothers who had patently first</p>
<p>seen the light of day on old Irish soil. Their faces showed</p>
<p>content and pride as they limped along with this lusty progeny of</p>
<p>theirs that had fed on better food.</p>
<p>Not with these did Mary and Saxon belong. They knew them not, had</p>
<p>no acquaintances among them. It did not matter whether the</p>
<p>festival were Irish, German, or Slavonian; whether the picnic was</p>
<p>the Bricklayers&#x27;, the Brewers&#x27;, or the Butchers&#x27;. They, the</p>
<p>girls, were of the dancing crowd that swelled by a certain</p>
<p>constant percentage the gate receipts of all the picnics.</p>
<p>They strolled about among the booths where peanuts were grinding</p>
<p>and popcorn was roasting in preparation for the day, and went on</p>
<p>and inspected the dance floor of the pavilion. Saxon, clinging to</p>
<p>an imaginary partner, essayed a few steps of the dip-waltz. Mary</p>
<p>clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;My!&quot; she cried. &quot;You&#x27;re just swell! An&#x27; them stockin&#x27;s is</p>
<p>peaches.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon smiled with appreciation, pointed out her foot,</p>
<p>velvet-slippered with high Cuban heels, and slightly lifted the</p>
<p>tight black skirt, exposing a trim ankle and delicate swell of</p>
<p>calf, the white flesh gleaming through the thinnest and flimsiest</p>
<p>of fifty-cent black silk stockings. She was slender, not tall,</p>
<p>yet the due round lines of womanhood were hers. On her white</p>
<p>shirtwaist was a pleated jabot of cheap lace, caught with a large</p>
<p>novelty pin of imitation coral. Over the shirtwaist was a natty</p>
<p>jacket, elbow-sleeved, and to the elbows she wore gloves of</p>
<p>imitation suede. The one essentially natural touch about her</p>
<p>appearance was the few curls, strangers to curling-irons, that</p>
<p>escaped from under the little naughty hat of black velvet pulled</p>
<p>low over the eyes.</p>
<p>Mary&#x27;s dark eyes flashed with joy at the sight, and with a swift</p>
<p>little run she caught the other girl in her arms and kissed her</p>
<p>in a breast-crushing embrace. She released her, blushing at her</p>
<p>own extravagance.</p>
<p>&quot;You look good to me,&quot; she cried, in extenuation. &quot;If I was a man</p>
<p>I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands off you. I&#x27;d eat you, I sure would.&quot;</p>
<p>They went out of the pavilion hand in hand, and on through the</p>
<p>sunshine they strolled, swinging hands gaily, reacting</p>
<p>exuberantly from the week of deadening toil. They hung over the</p>
<p>railing of the bear-pit, shivering at the huge and lonely</p>
<p>denizen, and passed quickly on to ten minutes of laughter at the</p>
<p>monkey cage. Crossing the grounds, they looked down into the</p>
<p>little race track on the bed of a natural amphitheater where the</p>
<p>early afternoon games were to take place. After that they</p>
<p>explored the woods, threaded by countless paths, ever opening out</p>
<p>in new surprises of green-painted rustic tables and benches in</p>
<p>leafy nooks, many of which were already pre-empted by family</p>
<p>parties. On a grassy slope, tree-surrounded, they spread a</p>
<p>newspaper and sat down on the short grass already tawny-dry under</p>
<p>the California sun. Half were they minded to do this because of</p>
<p>the grateful indolence after six days of insistent motion, half</p>
<p>in conservation for the hours of dancing to come.</p>
<p>&quot;Bert Wanhope&#x27;ll be sure to come,&quot; Mary chattered. &quot;An&#x27; he said</p>
<p>he was going to bring Billy Roberts--&#x27;Big Bill,&#x27; all the fellows</p>
<p>call him. He&#x27;s just a big boy, but he&#x27;s awfully tough. He&#x27;s a</p>
<p>prizefighter, an&#x27; all the girls run after him. I&#x27;m afraid of him.</p>
<p>He ain&#x27;t quick in talkin&#x27;. He&#x27;s more like that big bear we saw.</p>
<p>Brr-rf! Brr-rf!--bite your head off, just like that. He ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>really a prize-fighter. He&#x27;s a teamster--belongs to the union.</p>
<p>Drives for Coberly and Morrison. But sometimes he fights in the</p>
<p>clubs. Most of the fellows are scared of him. He&#x27;s got a bad</p>
<p>temper, an&#x27; he&#x27;d just as soon hit a fellow as eat, just like</p>
<p>that. You won&#x27;t like him, but he&#x27;s a swell dancer. He&#x27;s heavy,</p>
<p>you know, an&#x27; he just slides and glides around. You wanta have a</p>
<p>dance with&#x27;m anyway. He&#x27;s a good spender, too. Never pinches. But</p>
<p>my!--he&#x27;s got one temper.&quot;</p>
<p>The talk wandered on, a monologue on Mary&#x27;s part, that centered</p>
<p>always on Bert Wanhope.</p>
<p>&quot;You and he are pretty thick,&quot; Saxon ventured.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d marry&#x27;m to-morrow,&quot; Mary flashed out impulsively. Then her</p>
<p>face went bleakly forlorn, hard almost in its helpless pathos.</p>
<p>&quot;Only, he never asks me. He&#x27;s ...&quot; Her pause was broken by sudden</p>
<p>passion. &quot;You watch out for him, Saxon, if he ever comes foolin&#x27;</p>
<p>around you. He&#x27;s no good. Just the same, I&#x27;d marry him to-morrow.</p>
<p>He&#x27;ll never get me any other way.&quot; Her mouth opened, but instead</p>
<p>of speaking she drew a long sigh. &quot;It&#x27;s a funny world, ain&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>she added. &quot;More like a scream. And all the stars are worlds,</p>
<p>too. I wonder where God hides. Bert Wanhope says there ain&#x27;t no</p>
<p>God. But he&#x27;s just terrible. He says the most terrible things. I</p>
<p>believe in God. Don&#x27;t you? What do you think about God, Saxon?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shrugged her shoulders and laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;But if we do wrong we get ours, don&#x27;t we?&quot; Mary persisted.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s what they all say, except Bert. He says he don&#x27;t care</p>
<p>what he does, he&#x27;ll never get his, because when he dies he&#x27;s</p>
<p>dead, an&#x27; when he&#x27;s dead he&#x27;d like to see any one put anything</p>
<p>across on him that&#x27;d wake him up. Ain&#x27;t he terrible, though? But</p>
<p>it&#x27;s all so funny. Sometimes I get scared when I think God&#x27;s</p>
<p>keepin&#x27; an eye on me all the time. Do you think he knows what I&#x27;m</p>
<p>sayin&#x27; now? What do you think he looks like, anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Saxon answered. &quot;He&#x27;s just a funny proposition.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; the other gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;He IS, just the same, from what all people say of him,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>went on stoutly. &quot;My brother thinks he looks like Abraham</p>
<p>Lincoln. Sarah thinks he has whiskers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I never think of him with his hair parted,&quot; Mary confessed,</p>
<p>daring the thought and shivering with apprehension. &quot;He just</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t have his hair parted. THAT&#x27;D be funny.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know that little, wrinkly Mexican that sells wire puzzles?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon queried. &quot;Well, God somehow always reminds me of him.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary laughed outright.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that IS funny. I never thought of him like that How do you</p>
<p>make it out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, just like the little Mexican, he seems to spend his time</p>
<p>peddling puzzles. He passes a puzzle out to everybody, and they</p>
<p>spend all their lives tryin&#x27; to work it out They all get stuck. I</p>
<p>can&#x27;t work mine out. I don&#x27;t know where to start. And look at the</p>
<p>puzzle he passed Sarah. And she&#x27;s part of Tom&#x27;s puzzle, and she</p>
<p>only makes his worse. And they all, an&#x27; everybody I know--you,</p>
<p>too--are part of my puzzle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mebbe the puzzles is all right,&quot; Mary considered. &quot;But God don&#x27;t</p>
<p>look like that yellow little Greaser. THAT I won&#x27;t fall for. God</p>
<p>don&#x27;t look like anybody. Don&#x27;t you remember on the wall at the</p>
<p>Salvation Army it says &#x27;God is a spirit&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s another one of his puzzles, I guess, because nobody knows</p>
<p>what a spirit looks like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, too.&quot; Mary shuddered with reminiscent fear.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever I try to think of God as a spirit, I can see Hen Miller</p>
<p>all wrapped up in a sheet an&#x27; runnin&#x27; us girls. We didn&#x27;t know,</p>
<p>an&#x27; it scared the life out of us. Little Maggie Murphy fainted</p>
<p>dead away, and Beatrice Peralta fell an&#x27; scratched her face</p>
<p>horrible. When I think of a spirit all I can see is a white sheet</p>
<p>runnin&#x27; in the dark. Just the same, God don&#x27;t look like a</p>
<p>Mexican, an&#x27; he don&#x27;t wear his hair parted.&quot;</p>
<p>A strain of music from the dancing pavilion brought both girls</p>
<p>scrambling to their feet.</p>
<p>&quot;We can get a couple of dances in before we eat,&quot; Mary proposed.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; then it&#x27;ll be afternoon an&#x27; all the fellows &#x27;ll be here.</p>
<p>Most of them are pinchers--that&#x27;s why they don&#x27;t come early, so</p>
<p>as to get out of taking the girls to dinner. But Bert&#x27;s free with</p>
<p>his money, an&#x27; so is Billy. If we can beat the other girls to it,</p>
<p>they&#x27;ll take us to the restaurant. Come on, hurry, Saxon.&quot;</p>
<p>There were few couples on the floor when they arrived at the</p>
<p>pavilion, and the two girls essayed the first waltz together.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s Bert now,&quot; Saxon whispered, as they came around the</p>
<p>second time.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t take any notice of them,&quot; Mary whispered back. &quot;We&#x27;ll just</p>
<p>keep on goin&#x27;. They needn&#x27;t think we&#x27;re chasin&#x27; after them.&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon noted the heightened color in the other&#x27;s cheek, and</p>
<p>felt her quicker breathing.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you see that other one?&quot; Mary asked, as she backed Saxon in</p>
<p>a long slide across the far end of the pavilion. &quot;That was Billy</p>
<p>Roberts. Bert said he&#x27;d come. He&#x27;ll take you to dinner, and</p>
<p>Bert&#x27;ll take me. It&#x27;s goin&#x27; to be a swell day, you&#x27;ll see. My! I</p>
<p>only wish the music&#x27;ll hold out till we can get back to the other</p>
<p>end.&quot;</p>
<p>Down the floor they danced, on man-trapping and dinner-getting</p>
<p>intent, two fresh young things that undeniably danced well and</p>
<p>that were delightfully surprised when the music stranded them</p>
<p>perilously near to their desire.</p>
<p>Bert and Mary addressed each other by their given names, but to</p>
<p>Saxon Bert was &quot;Mr. Wanhope,&quot; though he called her by her first</p>
<p>name. The only introduction was of Saxon and Billy Roberts. Mary</p>
<p>carried it off with a flurry of nervous carelessness.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Robert--Miss Brown. She&#x27;s my best friend. Her first name&#x27;s</p>
<p>Saxon. Ain&#x27;t it a scream of a name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Billy retorted, hat off and hand extended.</p>
<p>&quot;Pleased to meet you, Miss Brown.&quot;</p>
<p>As their hands clasped and she felt the teamster callouses on his</p>
<p>palm, her quick eyes saw a score of things. About all that he saw</p>
<p>was her eyes, and then it was with a vague impression that they</p>
<p>were blue. Not till later in the day did he realize that they</p>
<p>were gray. She, on the contrary, saw his eyes as they really</p>
<p>were--deep blue, wide, and handsome in a sullen-boyish way. She</p>
<p>saw that they were straight-looking, and she liked them, as she</p>
<p>had liked the glimpse she had caught of his hand, and as she</p>
<p>liked the contact of his hand itself. Then, too, but not sharply,</p>
<p>she had perceived the short, square-set nose, the rosiness of</p>
<p>cheek, and the firm, short upper lip, ere delight centered her</p>
<p>flash of gaze on the well-modeled, large clean mouth where red</p>
<p>lips smiled clear of the white, enviable teeth. A BOY, A GREAT</p>
<p>BIG MAN-BOY, was her thought; and, as they smiled at each other</p>
<p>and their hands slipped apart, she was startled by a glimpse of</p>
<p>his hair--short and crisp and sandy, hinting almost of palest</p>
<p>gold save that it was too flaxen to hint of gold at all.</p>
<p>So blond was he that she was reminded of stage-types she had</p>
<p>seen, such as Ole Olson and Yon Yonson; but there resemblance</p>
<p>ceased. It was a matter of color only, for the eyes were</p>
<p>dark-lashed and -browed, and were cloudy with temperament rather</p>
<p>than staring a child-gaze of wonder, and the suit of smooth brown</p>
<p>cloth had been made by a tailor. Saxon appraised the suit on the</p>
<p>instant, and her secret judgment was NOT A CENT LESS THAN FIFTY</p>
<p>DOLLARS. Further, he had none of the awkwardness of the</p>
<p>Scandinavian immigrant. On the contrary, he was one of those rare</p>
<p>individuals that radiate muscular grace through the ungraceful</p>
<p>man-garments of civilization. Every movement was supple, slow,</p>
<p>and apparently considered. This she did not see nor analyze. She</p>
<p>saw only a clothed man with grace of carriage and movement. She</p>
<p>felt, rather than perceived, the calm and certitude of all the</p>
<p>muscular play of him, and she felt, too, the promise of easement</p>
<p>and rest that was especially grateful and craved-for by one who</p>
<p>had incessantly, for six days and at top-speed, ironed fancy</p>
<p>starch. As the touch of his hand had been good, so, to her, this</p>
<p>subtler feel of all of him, body and mind, was good.</p>
<p>As he took her program and skirmished and joked after the way of</p>
<p>young men, she realized the immediacy of delight she had taken in</p>
<p>him. Never in her life had she been so affected by any man. She</p>
<p>wondered to herself: IS THIS THE MAN?</p>
<p>He danced beautifully. The joy was hers that good dancers take</p>
<p>when they have found a good dancer for a partner. The grace of</p>
<p>those slow-moving, certain muscles of his accorded perfectly with</p>
<p>the rhythm of the music. There was never doubt, never a betrayal</p>
<p>of indecision. She glanced at Bert, dancing &quot;tough&quot; with Mary,</p>
<p>caroming down the long floor with more than one collision with</p>
<p>the increasing couples. Graceful himself in his slender, tall,</p>
<p>lean-stomached way, Bert was accounted a good dancer; yet Saxon</p>
<p>did not remember ever having danced with him with keen pleasure.</p>
<p>Just a hit of a jerk spoiled his dancing--a jerk that did not</p>
<p>occur, usually, but that always impended. There was something</p>
<p>spasmodic in his mind. He was too quick, or he continually</p>
<p>threatened to be too quick. He always seemed just on the verge of</p>
<p>overrunning the time. It was disquieting. He made for unrest.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a dream of a dancer,&quot; Billy Roberts was saying. &quot;I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>heard lots of the fellows talk about your dancing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love it,&quot; she answered.</p>
<p>But from the way she said it he sensed her reluctance to speak,</p>
<p>and danced on in silence, while she warmed with the appreciation</p>
<p>of a woman for gentle consideration. Gentle consideration was a</p>
<p>thing rarely encountered in the life she lived. IS THIS THE MAN?</p>
<p>She remembered Mary&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d marry him to-morrow,&quot; and caught</p>
<p>herself speculating on marrying Billy Roberts by the next day--if</p>
<p>he asked her.</p>
<p>With eyes that dreamily desired to close, she moved on in the</p>
<p>arms of this masterful, guiding pressure. A PRIZE-FIGHTER! She</p>
<p>experienced a thrill of wickedness as she thought of what Sarah</p>
<p>would say could she see her now, Only he wasn&#x27;t a prizefighter,</p>
<p>but a teamster.</p>
<p>Came an abrupt lengthening of step, the guiding pressure grew</p>
<p>more compelling, and she was caught up and carried along, though</p>
<p>her velvet-shod feet never left the floor. Then came the sudden</p>
<p>control down to the shorter step again, and she felt herself</p>
<p>being held slightly from him so that he might look into her face</p>
<p>and laugh with her in joy at the exploit. At the end, as the band</p>
<p>slowed in the last bars, they, too, slowed, their dance fading</p>
<p>with the music in a lengthening glide that ceased with the last</p>
<p>lingering tone.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re sure cut out for each other when it comes to dancin&#x27;,&quot; he</p>
<p>said, as they made their way to rejoin the other couple.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a dream,&quot; she replied.</p>
<p>So low was her voice that he bent to hear, and saw the flush in</p>
<p>her cheeks that seemed communicated to her eyes, which were</p>
<p>softly warm and sensuous. He took the program from her and</p>
<p>gravely and gigantically wrote his name across all the length of</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; now it&#x27;s no good,&quot; he dared. &quot;Ain&#x27;t no need for it.&quot;</p>
<p>He tore it across and tossed it aside.</p>
<p>&quot;Me for you, Saxon, for the next,&quot; was Bert&#x27;s greeting, as they</p>
<p>came up. &quot;You take Mary for the next whirl, Bill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothin&#x27; doin&#x27;, Bo,&quot; was the retort. &quot;Me an&#x27; Saxon&#x27;s framed up to</p>
<p>last the day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watch out for him, Saxon,&quot; Mary warned facetiously. &quot;He&#x27;s liable</p>
<p>to get a crush ou you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I know a good thing when I see it,&quot; Billy responded</p>
<p>gallantly.</p>
<p>&quot;And so do I,&quot; Saxon aided and abetted.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d &#x27;a&#x27; known you if I&#x27;d seen you in the dark,&quot; Billy added.</p>
<p>Mary regarded them with mock alarm, and Bert said good-naturedly:</p>
<p>&quot;All I got to say is you ain&#x27;t wastin&#x27; any time gettin&#x27; together.</p>
<p>Just the same, if&#x27; you can spare a few minutes from each other</p>
<p>after a couple more whirls, Mary an&#x27; me&#x27;d be complimented to have</p>
<p>your presence at dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just like that,&quot; chimed Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;Quit your kiddin&#x27;,&quot; Billy laughed back, turning his head to look</p>
<p>into Saxon&#x27;s eyes. &quot;Don&#x27;t listen to &#x27;em. They&#x27;re grouched because</p>
<p>they got to dance together. Bert&#x27;s a rotten dancer, and Mary</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t so much. Come on, there she goes. See you after two more</p>
<p>dances.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>They had dinner in the open-air, tree-walled dining-room, and</p>
<p>Saxon noted that it was Billy who paid the reckoning for the</p>
<p>four. They knew many of the young men and women at the other</p>
<p>tables, and greetings and fun flew back and forth. Bert was very</p>
<p>possessive with Mary, almost roughly so, resting his hand on</p>
<p>hers, catching and holding it, and, once, forcibly slipping off</p>
<p>her two rings and refusing to return them for a long while. At</p>
<p>times, when he put his arm around her waist, Mary promptly</p>
<p>disengaged it; and at other times, with elaborate obliviousness</p>
<p>that deceived no one, she allowed it to remain.</p>
<p>And Saxon, talking little but studying Billy Roberts very</p>
<p>intently, was satisfied that there would be an utter difference</p>
<p>in the way he would do such things . . . if ever he would do</p>
<p>them. Anyway, he&#x27;d never paw a girl as Bert and lots of the other</p>
<p>fellows did. She measured the breadth of Billy&#x27;s heavy shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do they call you &#x27;Big&#x27; Bill?&quot; she asked. &quot;You&#x27;re not so very</p>
<p>tall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope,&quot; he agreed. &quot;I&#x27;m only five feet eight an&#x27; three-quarters.</p>
<p>I guess it must be my weight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He fights at a hundred an&#x27; eighty,&quot; Bert interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, out it,&quot; Billy said quickly, a cloud-rift of displeasure</p>
<p>showing in his eyes. &quot;I ain&#x27;t a fighter. I ain&#x27;t fought in six</p>
<p>months. I&#x27;ve quit it. It don&#x27;t pay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yon got two hundred the night you put the Frisco Slasher to the</p>
<p>bad,&quot; Bert urged proudly.</p>
<p>&quot;Cut it. Cut it now.--Say, Saxon, you ain&#x27;t so big yourself, are</p>
<p>you? But you&#x27;re built just right if anybody should ask you.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re round an&#x27; slender at the same time. I bet I can guess your</p>
<p>weight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody gnesses over it,&quot; she warned, while inwardly she was</p>
<p>puzzled that she should at the same time be glad and regretful</p>
<p>that he did not fight any more.</p>
<p>&quot;Not me,&quot; he was saying. &quot;I&#x27;m a wooz at weight-guessin&#x27;. Just you</p>
<p>watch me.&quot; He regarded her critically, and it was patent that</p>
<p>warm approval played its little rivalry with the judgment of his</p>
<p>gaze. &quot;Wait a minute.&quot;</p>
<p>He reached over to her and felt her arm at the biceps. The</p>
<p>pressure of the encircling fingers was firm and honest, and Saxon</p>
<p>thrilled to it. There was magic in this man-boy. She would have</p>
<p>known only irritation had Bert or any other man felt her arm. But</p>
<p>this man! IS HE THE MAN? she was questioning, when he voiced his</p>
<p>conclusion.</p>
<p>&quot;Your clothes don&#x27;t weigh more&#x27;n seven pounds. And seven</p>
<p>from--hum--say one hundred an&#x27; twenty-three--one hundred an&#x27;</p>
<p>sixteen is your stripped weight.&quot;</p>
<p>But at the penultimate word, Mary cried out with sharp reproof:</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Billy Roberts, people don&#x27;t talk about such things.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked at her with slow-growing, uncomprehending surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;What things?&quot; he demanded finally.</p>
<p>&quot;There you go again! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Look!</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got Saxon blushing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not,&quot; Saxon denied indignantly.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; if you keep on, Mary, you&#x27;ll have me blushing,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>growled. &quot;I guess I know what&#x27;s right an&#x27; what ain&#x27;t. It ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>what a guy says, but what he thinks. An&#x27; I&#x27;m thinkin&#x27; right, an&#x27;</p>
<p>Saxon knows it. An&#x27; she an&#x27; I ain&#x27;t thinkin&#x27; what you&#x27;re thinkin&#x27;</p>
<p>at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; Mary cried. &quot;You&#x27;re gettin&#x27; worse an&#x27; worse. I never</p>
<p>think such things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, Mary! Backup!&quot; Bert checked her peremptorily. &quot;You&#x27;re in</p>
<p>the wrong stall. Billy never makes mistakes like that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he needn&#x27;t be so raw,&quot; she persisted.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, Mary, an&#x27; be good, an&#x27; cut that stuff,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>dismissal of her, as he turned to Saxon. &quot;How near did I come to</p>
<p>it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One hundred and twenty-two,&quot; she answered, looking deliberately</p>
<p>at Mary. &quot;One twenty two with my clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy burst into hearty laughter, in which Bert joined.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care,&quot; Mary protested, &quot;You&#x27;re terrible, both of</p>
<p>you--an&#x27; you, too, Saxon. I&#x27;d never a-thought it of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to me, kid,&quot; Bert began soothingly, as his arm slipped</p>
<p>around her waist.</p>
<p>But in the false excitement she had worked herself into, Mary</p>
<p>rudely repulsed the arm, and then, fearing that she had wounded</p>
<p>her lover&#x27;s feelings, she took advantage of the teasing and</p>
<p>banter to recover her good humor. His arm was permitted to</p>
<p>return, and with heads bent together, they talked in whispers.</p>
<p>Billy discreetly began to make conversation with Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, you know, your name is a funny one. I never heard it tagged</p>
<p>on anybody before. But it&#x27;s all right. I like it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother gave it to me. She was educated, and knew all kinds of</p>
<p>words. She was always reading books, almost until she died. And</p>
<p>she wrote lots and lots. I&#x27;ve got some of her poetry published in</p>
<p>a San Jose newspaper long ago. The Saxons were a race of</p>
<p>people--she told me all about them when I was a little girl. They</p>
<p>were wild, like Indians, only they were white. And they had blue</p>
<p>eyes, and yellow hair, and they were awful fighters.&quot;</p>
<p>As she talked, Billy followed her solemnly, his eyes steadily</p>
<p>turned on hers.</p>
<p>&quot;Never heard of them,&quot; he confessed. &quot;Did they live anywhere</p>
<p>around here?&quot;</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;No, They lived in England. They were the first English, and you</p>
<p>know the Americans came from the English. We&#x27;re Saxons, you an&#x27;</p>
<p>me, an&#x27; Mary, an&#x27; Bert, and all the Americans that are real</p>
<p>Americans, you know, and not Dagoes and Japs and such.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My folks lived in America a long time,&quot; Billy said slowly,</p>
<p>digesting the information she had given and relating himself to</p>
<p>it. &quot;Anyway, my mother&#x27;s folks did. They crossed to Maine</p>
<p>hundreds of years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My father was &#x27;State of Maine,&quot; she broke in, with a little</p>
<p>gurgle of joy. &quot;And my mother was horn in Ohio, or where Ohio is</p>
<p>now. She used to call it the Great Western Reserve. What was your</p>
<p>father?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t know.&quot; Billy shrugged his shoulders. &quot;He didn&#x27;t know</p>
<p>himself. Nobody ever knew, though he was American, all right, all</p>
<p>right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His name&#x27;s regular old American,&quot; Saxon suggested. &quot;There&#x27;s a</p>
<p>big English general right now whose name is Roberts. I&#x27;ve read it</p>
<p>in the papers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Roberts wasn&#x27;t my father&#x27;s name. He never knew what his name</p>
<p>was. Roberts was the name of a gold-miner who adopted him. You</p>
<p>see, it was this way. When they was Indian-fightin&#x27; up there with</p>
<p>the Modoc Indians, a lot of the miners an&#x27; settlers took a hand.</p>
<p>Roberts was captain of one outfit, and once, after a fight, they</p>
<p>took a lot of prisoners--squaws, an&#x27; kids an&#x27; babies. An&#x27; one of</p>
<p>the kids was my father. They figured he was about five years old.</p>
<p>He didn&#x27;t know nothin&#x27; but Indian.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon clapped her hands, and her eyes sparkled: &quot;He&#x27;d been</p>
<p>captured on an Indian raid!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the way they figured it,&quot; Billy nodded. &quot;They recollected</p>
<p>a wagon-train of Oregon settlers that&#x27;d been killed by the Modocs</p>
<p>four years before. Roberts adopted him, and that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>know his real name. But you can bank on it, he crossed the plains</p>
<p>just the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So did my father,&quot; Saxon said proudly.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; my mother, too,&quot; Billy added, pride touching his own voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway, she came pretty close to crossin&#x27; the plains, because</p>
<p>she was born in a wagon on the River Platte on the way out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother, too,&quot; said Saxon. &quot;She was eight years old, an&#x27; she</p>
<p>walked most of the way after the oxen began to give out.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy thrust out his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Put her there, kid,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;re just like old friends, what</p>
<p>with the same kind of folks behind us.&quot;</p>
<p>With shining eyes, Saxon extended her hand to his, and gravely</p>
<p>they shook.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it wonderful?&quot; she murmured. &quot;We&#x27;re both old American</p>
<p>stock. And if you aren&#x27;t a Saxon there never was one--your hair,</p>
<p>your eyes, your skin, everything. And you&#x27;re a fighter, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess all our old folks was fighters when it comes to that. It</p>
<p>come natural to &#x27;em, an&#x27; dog-gone it, they just had to fight or</p>
<p>they&#x27;d never come through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you two talkin&#x27; about?&quot; Mary broke in upon them.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;re thicker&#x27;n mush in no time,&quot; Bert girded. &quot;You&#x27;d think</p>
<p>they&#x27;d known each other a week already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, we knew each other longer than that,&quot; Saxon returned.</p>
<p>&quot;Before ever we were born our folks were walkin&#x27; across the</p>
<p>plains together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When your folks was waitin&#x27; for the railroad to be built an&#x27; all</p>
<p>the Indians killed off before they dasted to start for</p>
<p>California,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s way of proclaiming the new alliance.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re the real goods,Saxon an&#x27;n me, if anybody should ride up on</p>
<p>a buzz-wagon an&#x27; ask you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Mary boasted with quiet petulance. &quot;My father</p>
<p>stayed behind to fight in the Civil War. He was a drummer-boy.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why he didn&#x27;t come to California until afterward.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And my father went back to fight in the Civil War,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>&quot;And mine, too,&quot; said Billy.</p>
<p>They looked at each other gleefully. Again they had found a new</p>
<p>contact</p>
<p>&quot;Well, they&#x27;re all dead, ain&#x27;t they?&quot; was Bert&#x27;s saturnine</p>
<p>comment. &quot;There ain&#x27;t no difference dyin&#x27; in battle or in the</p>
<p>poorhouse. The thing is they&#x27;re deado. I wouldn&#x27;t care a rap if</p>
<p>my father&#x27;d been hanged. It&#x27;s all the same in a thousand years.</p>
<p>This braggin&#x27; about folks makes me tired. Besides, my father</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t a-fought. He wasn&#x27;t born till two years after the war.</p>
<p>Just the same, two of my uncles were killed at Gettysburg. Guess</p>
<p>we done our share.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just like that,&quot; Mary applauded.</p>
<p>Bert&#x27;s arm went around her waist again.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re here, ain&#x27;t we?&quot; he said. &quot;An&#x27; that&#x27;s what counts. The</p>
<p>dead are dead, an&#x27; you can bet your sweet life they just keep on</p>
<p>stayin&#x27; dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary put her hand over his mouth and began to chide him for his</p>
<p>awfulness, whereupon he kissed the palm of her hand and put his</p>
<p>head closer to hers.</p>
<p>The merry clatter of dishes was increasing as the dining-room</p>
<p>filled up. Here and there voices were raised in snatches of song.</p>
<p>There were shrill squeals and screams and bursts of heavier male</p>
<p>laughter as the everlasting skirmishing between the young men and</p>
<p>girls played on. Among some of the men the signs of drink were</p>
<p>already manifest. At a near table girls were calling out to</p>
<p>Billy. And Saxon, the sense of temporary possession already</p>
<p>strong on her, noted with jealous eyes that he was a favorite and</p>
<p>desired object to them.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t they awful?&quot; Mary voiced her disapproval. &quot;They got a</p>
<p>nerve. I know who they are. No respectable girl &#x27;d have a thing</p>
<p>to do with them. Listen to that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you Bill, you,&quot; one of them, a buxom young brunette, was</p>
<p>calling. &quot;Hope you ain&#x27;t forgotten me, Bill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you chicken,&quot; he called back gallantly.</p>
<p>Saxon flattered herself that he showed vexation, and she</p>
<p>conceived an immense dislike for the brunette.</p>
<p>&quot;Goin&#x27; to dance?&quot; the latter called.</p>
<p>&quot;Mebbe,&quot; he answered, and turned abruptly to Saxon. &quot;Say, we old</p>
<p>Americans oughta stick together, don&#x27;t you think? They ain&#x27;t many</p>
<p>of us left. The country&#x27;s fillin&#x27; up with all kinds of</p>
<p>foreigners.&quot;</p>
<p>He talked on steadily, in a low, confidential voice, head close</p>
<p>to hers, as advertisement to the other girl that he was occupied.</p>
<p>From the next table on the opposite side, a young man had singled</p>
<p>out Saxon. His dress was tough. His companions, male and female,</p>
<p>were tough. His face was inflamed, his eyes touched with</p>
<p>wildness.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, you!&quot; he called. &quot;You with the velvet slippers. Me for</p>
<p>you.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl beside him put her arm around his neck and tried to hush</p>
<p>him, and through the mufflement of her embrace they could hear</p>
<p>him gurgling:</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you she&#x27;s some goods. Watch me go across an&#x27; win her from</p>
<p>them cheap skates.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Butchertown hoodlums,&quot; Mary sniffed.</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s eyes encountered the eyes of the girl, who glared hatred</p>
<p>across at her. And in Billy&#x27;s eyes she saw moody anger</p>
<p>smouldering. The eyes were more sullen, more handsome than ever,</p>
<p>and clouds and veils and lights and shadowe shifted and deepened</p>
<p>in the blue of them until they gave her a sense of unfathomable</p>
<p>depth. He had stopped talking, and he made no effort to talk.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t start a rough house, Bill,&quot; Bert cautioned. &quot;They&#x27;re from</p>
<p>across the hay an&#x27; they don&#x27;t know you, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>Bert stood up suddenly, stepped over to the other table,</p>
<p>whispered briefly, and came back. Every face at the table was</p>
<p>turned on Billy. The offendor arose brokenly, shook off the</p>
<p>detaining hand of his girl, and came over. He was a large man,</p>
<p>with a hard, malignant face and bitter eyes. Also, he was a</p>
<p>subdued man.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re Big Bill Roberts,&quot; he said thickly, clinging to the table</p>
<p>as he reeled. &quot;I take my hat off to you. I apologire. I admire</p>
<p>your taste in skirts, an&#x27; take it from me that&#x27;s a compliment;</p>
<p>but I did&#x27;nt know who you was. If I&#x27;d knowed you was Bill Roberts</p>
<p>there wouldn&#x27;t been a peep from my fly-trap. D&#x27;ye get me? I</p>
<p>apologize. Will you shake hands?&quot;</p>
<p>Gruffly, Billy said, &quot;It&#x27;s all right--forget it, sport;&quot; and</p>
<p>sullenly he shook hands and with a slow, massive movement thrust</p>
<p>the other back toward his own table.</p>
<p>Saxon was glowing. Here was a man, a protector, something to lean</p>
<p>against, of whom even the Butchertown toughs were afraid as soon</p>
<p>as his name was mentioned.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>After dinner there were two dances in the pavilion, and then the</p>
<p>band led the way to the race track for the games. The dancers</p>
<p>followed, and all through the grounds the picnic parties left</p>
<p>their tables to join in. Five thousand packed the grassy slopes</p>
<p>of the amphitheater and swarmed inside the race track. Here,</p>
<p>first of the events, the men were lining up for a tug of war. The</p>
<p>contest was between the Oakland Bricklayers and the San Francisco</p>
<p>Bricklayers, and the picked braves, huge and heavy, were taking</p>
<p>their positions along the rope. They kicked heel-holds in the</p>
<p>soft earth, rubbed their hands with the soil from underfoot, and</p>
<p>laughed and joked with the crowd that surged about them.</p>
<p>The judges and watchers struggled vainly to keep back this crowd</p>
<p>of relatives and friends. The Celtic blood was up, and the Celtic</p>
<p>faction spirit ran high. The air was filled with cries of cheer,</p>
<p>advice, warning, and threat. Many elected to leave the side of</p>
<p>their own team and go to the side of the other team with the</p>
<p>intention of circumventing foul play. There were as many women as</p>
<p>men among the jostling supporters. The dust from the trampling,</p>
<p>scuffling feet rose in the air, and Mary gasped and coughed and</p>
<p>begged Bert to take her away. But he, the imp in him elated with</p>
<p>the prospect of trouble, insisted on urging in closer. Saxon</p>
<p>clung to Billy, who slowly and methodically elbowed and</p>
<p>shouldered a way for her.</p>
<p>&quot;No place for a girl,&quot; he grumbled, looking down at her with a</p>
<p>masked expression of absent-mindedness, while his elbow</p>
<p>powerfully crushed on the ribs of a big Irishman who gave room.</p>
<p>&quot;Things&#x27;ll break loose when they start pullin&#x27;. They&#x27;s been too</p>
<p>much drink, an&#x27; you know what the Micks are for a rough house.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was very much out of place among these large-bodied men and</p>
<p>women. She seemed very small and childlike, delicate and fragile,</p>
<p>a creature from another race. Only Billy&#x27;s skilled bulk and</p>
<p>muscle saved her. He was continually glancing from face to face</p>
<p>of the women and always returning to study her face, nor was she</p>
<p>unaware of the contrast he was making.</p>
<p>Some excitement occurred a score of feet away from them, and to</p>
<p>the sound of exclamations and blows a surge ran through the</p>
<p>crowd. A large man, wedged sidewise in the jam, was shoved</p>
<p>against Saxon, crushing her closely against Billy, who reached</p>
<p>across to the man&#x27;s shoulder with a massive thrust that was not</p>
<p>so slow as usual. An involuntary grunt came from the victim, who</p>
<p>turned his head, showing sun-reddened blond skin and unmistakable</p>
<p>angry Irish eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s eatin&#x27; yeh?&quot; he snarled.</p>
<p>&quot;Get off your foot; you&#x27;re standin&#x27; on it,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>contemptuous reply, emphasized by an increase of thrust.</p>
<p>The Irishman grunted again and made a frantic struggle to twist</p>
<p>his body around, but the wedging bodies on either side held him</p>
<p>in a vise.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll break yer ugly face for yeh in a minute,&quot; he announced in</p>
<p>wrath-thick tones.</p>
<p>Then his own face underwent transformation. The snarl left the</p>
<p>lips, and the angry eyes grew genial.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; sure an&#x27; it&#x27;s yerself,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know it was yeh</p>
<p>a-shovin&#x27;. I seen yeh lick the Terrible Swede, if yeh WAS robbed</p>
<p>on the decision.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you didn&#x27;t, Bo,&quot; Billy answered pleasantly. &quot;You saw me take</p>
<p>a good beatin&#x27; that night. The decision was all right.&quot;</p>
<p>The Irishman was now beaming. He had endeavored to pay a</p>
<p>compliment with a lie, and the prompt repudiation of the lie</p>
<p>served only to increase his hero-worship.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, an&#x27; a bad beatin&#x27; it was,&quot; he acknowledged, &quot;but yeh</p>
<p>showed the grit of a bunch of wildcats. Soon as I can get me arm</p>
<p>free I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to shake yeh by the hand an&#x27; help yeh aise yer</p>
<p>young lady.&quot;</p>
<p>Frustrated in the struggle to get the crowd back, the referee</p>
<p>fired his revolver in the air, and the tug-of-war was on.</p>
<p>Pandemonium broke loose. Saxon, protected by the two big men, was</p>
<p>near enough to the front to see much that ensued. The men on the</p>
<p>rope pulled and strained till their faces were red with effort</p>
<p>and their joints crackled. The rope was new, and, as their hands</p>
<p>slipped, their wives and daughters sprang in, scooping up the</p>
<p>earth in double handfuls and pouring it on the rope and the hands</p>
<p>of their men to give them better grip.</p>
<p>A stout, middle-aged woman, carried beyond herself by the passion</p>
<p>of the contest, seized the rope and pulled beside her husband,</p>
<p>encouraged him with loud cries. A watcher from the opposing team</p>
<p>dragged her screaming away and was dropped like a steer by an</p>
<p>ear-blow from a partisan from the woman&#x27;s team. He, in turn, went</p>
<p>down, and brawny women joined with their men in the battle.</p>
<p>Vainly the judges and watchers begged, pleaded, yelled, and swung</p>
<p>with their fists. Men, as well as women, were springing in to thc</p>
<p>rope and pulling. No longer was it team against team, but all</p>
<p>Oakland against all San Francisco, festooned with a free-for-all</p>
<p>fight. Hands overlaid hands two and three deep in the struggle to</p>
<p>grasp the rope. And hands that found no holds, doubled into</p>
<p>bunches of knuckles that impacted on the jaws of the watchers who</p>
<p>strove to tear hand-holds from the rope.</p>
<p>Bert yelped with joy, while Mary clung to him, mad with fear.</p>
<p>Close to the rope the fighters were going down and being</p>
<p>trampled. The dust arose in clouds, while from beyond, all</p>
<p>around, unable to get into the battle, could be heard the shrill</p>
<p>and impotent rage-screams and rage-yells of women and men.</p>
<p>&quot;Dirty work, dirty work,&quot; Billy muttered over and over; and,</p>
<p>though he saw much that occurred, assisted by the friendly</p>
<p>Irishman he was coolly and safely working Saxon back out of the</p>
<p>melee.</p>
<p>At last the break came. The losing team, accompanied by its host</p>
<p>of volunteers, was dragged in a rush over the ground and</p>
<p>disappeared under the avalanche of battling forms of the</p>
<p>onlookers.</p>
<p>Leaving Saxon under the protection of the Irishman in an outer</p>
<p>eddy of calm, Billy plunged back into the mix-up. Several minutes</p>
<p>later he emerged with the missing couple--Bert bleeding from a</p>
<p>blow on the ear, but hilarious, and Mary rumpled and hysterical.</p>
<p>&quot;This ain&#x27;t sport,&quot; she kept repeating. &quot;It&#x27;s a shame, a dirty</p>
<p>shame.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We got to get outa this,&quot; Billy said. &quot;The fun&#x27;s only</p>
<p>commenced.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, wait,&quot; Bert begged. &quot;It&#x27;s worth eight dollars. It&#x27;s cheap at</p>
<p>any price. I ain&#x27;t seen so many black eyes and bloody noses in a</p>
<p>month of Sundays.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, go on back an&#x27; enjoy yourself,&quot; Billy commended. &quot;I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>take the girls up there on the side hill where we can look on.</p>
<p>But I won&#x27;t give much for your good looks if some of them Micks</p>
<p>lands on you.&quot;</p>
<p>The trouble was over in an amazingly short time, for from the</p>
<p>judges&#x27; stand beside the track the announcer was bellowing the</p>
<p>start of the boys&#x27; foot-race; and Bert, disappointed, joined</p>
<p>Billy and the two girls on the hillside looking down upon the</p>
<p>track.</p>
<p>There were boys&#x27; races and girls&#x27; races, races of young women and</p>
<p>old women, of fat men and fat women, sack races and three-legged</p>
<p>races, and the contestants strove around the small track through</p>
<p>a Bedlam of cheering supporters. The tug-of-war was already</p>
<p>forgotten, and good nature reigned again.</p>
<p>Five young men toed the mark, crouching with fingertips to the</p>
<p>ground and waiting the starter&#x27;s revolver-shot. Three were in</p>
<p>their stocking-feet, and the remaining two wore spiked</p>
<p>running-shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;Young men&#x27;s race,&quot; Bert read from the program. &quot;An&#x27; only one</p>
<p>prize--twenty-five dollars. See the red-head with the spikes--the</p>
<p>one next to the outside. San Francisco&#x27;s set on him winning. He&#x27;s</p>
<p>their crack, an&#x27; there&#x27;s a lot of bets up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who&#x27;s goin&#x27; to win?&quot; Mary deferred to Billy&#x27;s superior athletic</p>
<p>knowledge.</p>
<p>&quot;How can I tell!&quot; he answered. &quot;I never saw any of &#x27;em before.</p>
<p>But they all look good to me. May the best one win, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>The revolver was fired, and the five runners were off and away.</p>
<p>Three were outdistanced at the start. Redhead led, with a</p>
<p>black-haired young man at his shoulder, and it was plain that the</p>
<p>race lay between these two. Halfway around, the black-haired one</p>
<p>took the lead in a spurt that was intended to last to the finish.</p>
<p>Ten feet he gained, nor could Red-head cut it down an inch.</p>
<p>&quot;The boy&#x27;s a streak,&quot; Billy commented. &quot;He ain&#x27;t tryin&#x27; his</p>
<p>hardest, an&#x27; Red-head&#x27;s just bustin&#x27; himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Still ten feet in the lead, the black-haired one breasted the</p>
<p>tape in a hubbub of cheers. Yet yells of disapproval could be</p>
<p>distinguished. Bert hugged himself with joy.</p>
<p>&quot;Mm-mm,&quot; he gloated. &quot;Ain&#x27;t Frisco sore? Watch out for fireworks</p>
<p>now. See! He&#x27;s bein&#x27; challenged. The judges ain&#x27;t payin&#x27; him the</p>
<p>money. An&#x27; he&#x27;s got a gang behind him. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ain&#x27;t had so</p>
<p>much fun since my old woman broke her leg!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#x27;t they pay him, Billy?&quot; Saxon asked. &quot;He won.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Frisco bunch is challengin&#x27; him for a professional,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>elucidated. &quot;That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re all beefin&#x27; about. But it ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>right. They all ran for that money, so they&#x27;re all professional.&quot;</p>
<p>The crowd surged and argued and roared in front of the judges&#x27;</p>
<p>stand. The stand was a rickety, two-story affair, the second</p>
<p>story open at the front, and here the judges could be seen</p>
<p>debating as heatedly as the crowd beneath them.</p>
<p>&quot;There she starts!&quot; Bert cried. &quot;Oh, you rough-house!&quot;</p>
<p>The black-haired racer, backed by a dozen supporters, was</p>
<p>climbing the outside stairs to the judges.</p>
<p>&quot;The purse-holder&#x27;s his friend,&quot; Billy said. &quot;See, he&#x27;s paid him,</p>
<p>an&#x27; some of the judges is willin&#x27; an&#x27; some are beefin&#x27;. An&#x27; now</p>
<p>that other gang&#x27;s going up--they&#x27;re Redhead&#x27;s.&quot; He turned to</p>
<p>Saxon with a reassuring smile. &quot;We&#x27;re well out of it this time.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s goin&#x27; to be rough stuff down there in a minute.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The judges are tryin&#x27; to make him give the money back,&quot; Bert</p>
<p>explained. &quot;An&#x27; if he don&#x27;t the other gang&#x27;ll take it away from</p>
<p>him. See! They&#x27;re reachin&#x27; for it now.&quot;</p>
<p>High above his head, the winner held the roll of paper containing</p>
<p>the twenty-five silver dollars. His gang, around him, was</p>
<p>shouldering back those who tried to seize the money. No blows had</p>
<p>been struck yet, but the struggle increased until the frail</p>
<p>structure shook and swayed. From the crowd beneath the winner was</p>
<p>variously addressed: &quot;Give it baok, you dog!&quot; &quot;Hang on to it,</p>
<p>Tim!&quot; &quot;You won fair, Timmy!&quot; &quot;Give it back, you dirty robber!&quot;</p>
<p>Abuse unprintable as well as friendly advice was hurled at him.</p>
<p>The struggle grew more violent. Tim&#x27;s supporters strove to hold</p>
<p>him off the floor so that his hand would still be above the</p>
<p>grasping hands that shot up. Once, for an instant, his arm was</p>
<p>jerked down. Again it went up. But evidently the paper had</p>
<p>broken, and with a last desperate effort, before he went down,</p>
<p>Tim flung the coin out in a silvery shower upon the heads of the</p>
<p>crowd beneath. Then ensued a weary period of arguing and</p>
<p>quarreling.</p>
<p>&quot;I wish they&#x27;d finish, so as we could get back to the dancin&#x27;,&quot;</p>
<p>Mary complained. &quot;This ain&#x27;t no fun.&quot;</p>
<p>Slowly and painfully the judges&#x27; stand was cleared, and an</p>
<p>announcer, stepping to the front of the stand, spread his arms</p>
<p>appealing for silence. The angiy clamor died down.</p>
<p>&quot;The judges have decided,&quot; he shouted, &quot;that this day of good</p>
<p>fellowship an&#x27; brotherhood--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hear! Hear!&quot; Many of the cooler heads applauded. &quot;That&#x27;s the</p>
<p>stuff!&quot; &quot;No fightin&#x27;!&quot; &quot;No hard feelin&#x27;s!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; therefore,&quot; the announcer became audible again, &quot;the judges</p>
<p>have decided to put up another purse of twenty-five dollars an&#x27;</p>
<p>run the race over again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; Tim?&quot; bellowed scores of throats. &quot;What about Tim?&quot; &quot;He&#x27;s</p>
<p>been robbed!&quot; &quot;The judges is rotten!&quot;</p>
<p>Again the announcer stilled the tumult with his arm appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;The judges have decided, for the sake of good feelin&#x27;, that</p>
<p>Timothy McManus will also run. If he wins, the money&#x27;s his.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now wouldn&#x27;t that jar you?&quot; Billy grumbled disgustedly. &quot;If</p>
<p>Tim&#x27;s eligible now, he was eligible the first time. An&#x27; if he was</p>
<p>eligible the first time, then the money was his.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Red-head&#x27;ll bust himself wide open this time,&quot; Bert jubilated.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; so will Tim,&quot; Billy rejoined. &quot;You can bet he&#x27;s mad clean</p>
<p>through, and he&#x27;ll let out the links he was holdin&#x27; in last</p>
<p>time.&quot;</p>
<p>Another quarter of an hour was spent in clearing the track of the</p>
<p>excited crowd, and this time only Tim and Red-head toed the mark.</p>
<p>The other three young men had abandoned the contest.</p>
<p>The leap of Tim, at the report of the revolver, put him a clean</p>
<p>yard in the lead.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess he&#x27;s professional, all right, all right,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>remarked. &quot;An&#x27; just look at him go!&quot;</p>
<p>Half-way around, Tim led by fifty feet, and, running swiftly,</p>
<p>maintaining the same lead, he came down the homestretch an easy</p>
<p>winner. When directly beneath the group on the hillside, the</p>
<p>incredible and unthinkable happened. Standing close to the inside</p>
<p>edge of the track was a dapper young man with a light switch</p>
<p>cane. He was distinctly out of place in such a gathering, for</p>
<p>upon him was no ear-mark of the working class. Afterward, Bert</p>
<p>was of the opinion that he looked like a swell dancing master,</p>
<p>while Billy called him &quot;the dude.&quot;</p>
<p>So far as Timothy McManus was concerned, the dapper young man was</p>
<p>destiny; for as Tim passed him, the young man, with utmost</p>
<p>deliberation, thrust his cane between Tim&#x27;s flying legs. Tim</p>
<p>sailed through the air in a headlong pitch, struck spread-eagled</p>
<p>on his face, and plowed along in a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>There was an instant of vast and gasping silence. The young man,</p>
<p>too, seemed petrified by the ghastliness of his deed. It took an</p>
<p>approciable interval of time for him, as well as for the</p>
<p>onlookers, to realize what he had done. They recovered first, and</p>
<p>from a thousand throats the wild Irish yell went up. Red-head won</p>
<p>the race without a cheer. The storm center had shifted to the</p>
<p>young man with the cane. After the yell, he had one moment of</p>
<p>indecision; then he turned and darted up the track.</p>
<p>&quot;Go it, sport!&quot; Bert cheered, waving his hat in the air. &quot;You&#x27;re</p>
<p>the goods for me! Who&#x27;d a-thought it? Who&#x27;d a-thought it?</p>
<p>Say!--wouldn&#x27;t it, now? Just wouldn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Phew! He&#x27;s a streak himself,&quot; Billy admired. &quot;But what did he do</p>
<p>it for? He&#x27;s no bricklayer.&quot;</p>
<p>Like a frightened rabbit, the mad roar at his heels, the young</p>
<p>man tore up the track to an open space on the hillside, up which</p>
<p>he clawed and disappeared among the trees. Behind him toiled a</p>
<p>hundred vengeful runners.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s too bad he&#x27;s missing the rest of it,&quot; Billy said. &quot;Look at</p>
<p>&#x27;em goin&#x27; to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Bert was beside himself. He leaped up and down and cried</p>
<p>continuously.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at &#x27;em! Look at &#x27;em! Look at &#x27;em!&quot;</p>
<p>The Oakland faction was outraged. Twice had its favorite runner</p>
<p>been jobbed out of the race. This last was only another vile</p>
<p>trick of the Frisco faction. So Oakland doubled its brawny fists</p>
<p>and swung into San Francisco for blood. And San Francisco,</p>
<p>consciously innocent, was no less willing to join issues. To be</p>
<p>charged with such a crime was no less monstrous than the crime</p>
<p>itself. Besides, for too many tedious hours had the Irish</p>
<p>heroically suppressed themselves. Five thousands of them exploded</p>
<p>into joyous battle. The women joined with them. The whole</p>
<p>amphitheater was filled with the conflict. There were rallies,</p>
<p>retreats, charges, and counter-charges. Weaker groups were forced</p>
<p>fighting up the hillsides. Other groups, bested, fled among the</p>
<p>trees to carry on guerrilla warfare, emerging in sudden dashes to</p>
<p>overwhelm isolated enemies. Half a dozen special policemen, hired</p>
<p>by the Weasel Park management, received an impartial trouncing</p>
<p>from both sides.</p>
<p>&quot;Nohody&#x27;s the friend of a policeman,&quot; Bert chortled, dabbing his</p>
<p>handkerchief to his injured ear, which still bled.</p>
<p>The bushes crackled behind him, and he sprang aside to let the</p>
<p>locked forms of two men go by, rolling over and over down the</p>
<p>hill, each striking when uppermost, and followed by a screaming</p>
<p>woman who rained blows on the one who was patently not of her</p>
<p>clan.</p>
<p>The judges, in the second story of the stand, valiantly withstood</p>
<p>a fierce assault until the frail structure toppled to the ground</p>
<p>in splinters.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s that woman doing?&quot; Saxon asked, calling attention to an</p>
<p>elderly woman beneath them on the track, who had sat down and was</p>
<p>pulling from her foot an elastic-sided shoe of generous</p>
<p>dimensions.</p>
<p>&quot;Goin&#x27; swimming,&quot; Bert chuckled, as the stocking followed.</p>
<p>They watched, fascinated. The shoe was pulled on again over the</p>
<p>bare foot. Then the woman slipped a rock the size of her fist</p>
<p>into the stocking, and, brandishing this ancient and horrible</p>
<p>weapon, lumbered into the nearest fray.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!--Oh!--Oh!&quot; Bert screamed, with every blow she struck &quot;Hey,</p>
<p>old flannel-mouth! Watch out! You&#x27;ll get yours in a second. Oh!</p>
<p>Oh! A peach! Did you see it? Hurray for the old lady! Look at her</p>
<p>tearin&#x27; into &#x27;em! Watch out, old girl! ... Ah-h-h.&quot;</p>
<p>His voice died away regretfully, as the one with the stocking,</p>
<p>whose hair had been clutched from behind by another Amazon, was</p>
<p>whirled about in a dizzy semicircle.</p>
<p>Vainly Mary clung to his arm, shaking him back and forth and</p>
<p>remonstrating.</p>
<p>&quot;Can&#x27;t you be sensible?&quot; she cried. &quot;It&#x27;s awful! I tell you it&#x27;s</p>
<p>awful!&quot;</p>
<p>But Bert was irrepressible.</p>
<p>&quot;Go it, old girl!&quot; he encouraged. &quot;You win! Me for you every</p>
<p>time! Now&#x27;s your chance! Swat! Oh! My! A peach! A peach!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the biggest rough-house I ever saw,&quot; Billy confided to</p>
<p>Saxon. &quot;It sure takes the Micks to mix it. But what did that dude</p>
<p>wanta do it for? That&#x27;s what gets me. He wasn&#x27;t a bricklayer--not</p>
<p>even a workingman--just a regular sissy dude that didn&#x27;t know a</p>
<p>livin&#x27; soul in the grounds. But if he wanted to raise a</p>
<p>rough-house he certainly done it. Look at &#x27;em. They&#x27;re fightin&#x27;</p>
<p>everywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>He broke into sudden laughter, so hearty that the tears came into</p>
<p>his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; Saxon asked, anxious not to miss anything.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s that dude,&quot; Billy explained between gusts. &quot;What did he</p>
<p>wanta do it for? That&#x27;s what gets my goat. What&#x27;d he wanta do it</p>
<p>for?&quot;</p>
<p>There was more crashing in the brush, and two women erupted upon</p>
<p>the scene, one in flight, the other pursuing. Almost ere they</p>
<p>could realize it, the little group found itself merged in the</p>
<p>astounding conflict that covered, if not the face of creation, at</p>
<p>least all the visible landscape of Weasel Park.</p>
<p>The fleeing woman stumbled in rounding the end of a picnic bench,</p>
<p>and would have been caught had she not seized Mary&#x27;s arm to</p>
<p>recover balance, and then flung Mary full into the arms of the</p>
<p>woman who pursued. This woman, largely built, middle-aged, and</p>
<p>too irate to comprehend, clutched Mary&#x27;s hair by one hand and</p>
<p>lifted the other to smack her. Before the blow could fall, Billy</p>
<p>had seized both the woman&#x27;s wrists.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, old girl, cut it out,&quot; he said appeasingly. &quot;You&#x27;re in</p>
<p>wrong. She ain&#x27;t done nothin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the woman did a strange thing. Making no resistance, but</p>
<p>maintaining her hold on the girl&#x27;s hair, she stood still and</p>
<p>calmly began to scream. The scream was hideously compounded of</p>
<p>fright and fear. Yet in her face was neither fright nor fear. She</p>
<p>regarded Billy coolly and appraisingly, as if to see how he took</p>
<p>it--her scream merely the cry to the clan for help.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, shut up, you battleax!&quot; Bert vociferated, trying to drag her</p>
<p>off by the shoulders.</p>
<p>The result was that The four rocked back and forth, while the</p>
<p>woman calmly went on screaming. The scream became touched with</p>
<p>triumph as more crashing was heard in the brush.</p>
<p>Saxon saw Billy&#x27;s slow eyes glint suddenly to the hardness of</p>
<p>steel, and at the same time she saw him put pressure on his</p>
<p>wrist-holds. The woman released her grip on Mary and was shoved</p>
<p>back and free. Then the first man of the rescue was upon them. He</p>
<p>did not pause to inquire into the merits of the affair. It was</p>
<p>sufficient that he saw the woman reeling away from Billy and</p>
<p>screaming with pain that was largely feigned.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all a mistake,&quot; Billy cried hurriedly. &quot;We apologize,</p>
<p>sport--&quot;</p>
<p>The Irishman swung ponderously. Billy ducked, cutting his apology</p>
<p>short, and as the sledge-like fist passed over his head, he drove</p>
<p>his left to the other&#x27;s jaw. The big Irishman toppled over</p>
<p>sidewise and sprawled on the edge of the slope. Half-scrambled</p>
<p>back to his feet and out of balance, he was caught by Bert&#x27;s</p>
<p>fist, and this time went clawing down the slope that was slippery</p>
<p>with short, dry grass.   Bert was redoubtable. &quot;That for you, old</p>
<p>girl--my compliments,&quot; was his cry, as he shoved the woman over</p>
<p>the edge on to the treacherous slope. Three more men were</p>
<p>emerging from the brush.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Billy had put Saxon in behind the protection of</p>
<p>the picnic table. Mary, who was hysterical, had evinced a desire</p>
<p>to cling to him, and he had sent her sliding across the top of</p>
<p>the table to Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, you flannel-mouths!&quot; Bert yelled at the newcomers,</p>
<p>himself swept away by passion, his black eyes flashing wildly,</p>
<p>his dark face inflamed by the too-ready blood. &quot;Come on, you</p>
<p>cheap skates! Talk about Gettysburg. We&#x27;ll show you all the</p>
<p>Americans ain&#x27;t dead yet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut your trap--we don&#x27;t want a scrap with the girls here,&quot;</p>
<p>Billy growled harshly, holding his position in front of the</p>
<p>table. He turned to the three rescuers, who were bewildered by</p>
<p>the lack of anything visible to rescue. &quot;Go on, sports. We don&#x27;t</p>
<p>want a row. You&#x27;re in wrong. They ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; doin&#x27; in the</p>
<p>fight line. We don&#x27;t wanta fight--d&#x27;ye get me?&quot;</p>
<p>They still hesitated, and Billy might have succeeded in avoiding</p>
<p>trouble had not the man who had gone down the bank chosen that</p>
<p>unfortunate moment to reappear, crawling groggily on hands and</p>
<p>knees and showing a bleeding face. Again Bert reached him and</p>
<p>sent him downslope, and the other three, with wild yells, sprang</p>
<p>in on Billy, who punched, shifted position, ducked and punched,</p>
<p>and shifted again ere he struck the thiird time. His blows were</p>
<p>clean end hard, scientifically delivered, with the weight of his</p>
<p>body behind.</p>
<p>Saxon, looking on, saw his eyes and learned more about him. She</p>
<p>was frightened, but clear-seeing, and she was startled by the</p>
<p>disappearance of all depth of light and shadow in his eyes. They</p>
<p>showed surface only--a hard, bright surface, almost glazed,</p>
<p>devoid of all expression save deadly seriousness. Bert&#x27;s eyes</p>
<p>showed madness. The eyes of the Irishmen were angry and serious,</p>
<p>and yet not all serious. There was a wayward gleam in them, as if</p>
<p>they enjoyed the fracas. But in Billy&#x27;s eyes was no enjoyment. It</p>
<p>was as if he had certain work to do and had doggedly settled down</p>
<p>to do it.</p>
<p>Scarcely more expression did she note in the face, though there</p>
<p>was nothing in common between it and the one she had seen all</p>
<p>day. The boyishness had vanished. This face was mature in a</p>
<p>terrifying, ageless way. There was no anger in it, Nor was it</p>
<p>even pitiless. It seemed to have glazed as hard and passionlessly</p>
<p>as his eyes. Something came to her of her wonderful mother&#x27;s</p>
<p>tales of the ancient Saxons, and he seemed to her one of those</p>
<p>Saxons, and she caught a glimpse, on the well of her</p>
<p>consciousness, of a long, dark boat, with a prow like the beak of</p>
<p>a bird of prey, and of huge, half-naked men, wing-helmeted, and</p>
<p>one of their faces, it seemed to her, was his face. She did not</p>
<p>reason this. She felt it, and visioned it as by an unthinkable</p>
<p>clairvoyance, and gasped, for the flurry of war was over. It had</p>
<p>lasted only seconds, Bert was dancing on the edge of the slippery</p>
<p>slope and mocking the vanquished who had slid impotently to the</p>
<p>bottom. But Billy took charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, you girls,&quot; he commanded. &quot;Get onto yourself, Bert. We</p>
<p>got to get onta this. We can&#x27;t fight an army.&quot;</p>
<p>He led the retreat, holding Saxon&#x27;s arm, and Bert, giggling and</p>
<p>jubilant, brought up the rear with an indignant Mary who</p>
<p>protested vainly in his unheeding ears.</p>
<p>For a hundred yards they ran and twisted through the trees, and</p>
<p>then, no signs of pursuit appearing, they slowed down to a</p>
<p>dignified saunter. Bert, the trouble-seeker, pricked his ears to</p>
<p>the muffled sound of blows and sobs, and stepped aside to</p>
<p>investigate.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! look what I&#x27;ve found!&quot; he called.</p>
<p>They joined him on the edge of a dry ditch and looked down. In</p>
<p>the bottom were two men, strays from the fight, grappled together</p>
<p>and still fighting. They were weeping out of sheer fatigue and</p>
<p>helplessness, and the blows they only occasionally struck were</p>
<p>open-handed and ineffectual.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, you, sport--throw sand in his eyes,&quot; Bert counseled.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s it, blind him an&#x27; he&#x27;s your&#x27;n.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop that!&quot; Billy shouted at the man, who was following</p>
<p>instructions, &quot;Or I&#x27;ll come down there an&#x27; beat you up myself.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s all over--d&#x27;ye get me? It&#x27;s all over an&#x27; everybody&#x27;s</p>
<p>friends. Shake an&#x27; make up. The drinks are on both of you. That&#x27;s</p>
<p>right--here, gimme your hand an&#x27; I&#x27;ll pull you out.&quot;</p>
<p>They left them shaking hands and brushing each other&#x27;s clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;It soon will be over,&quot; Billy grinned to Saxon. &quot;I know &#x27;em.</p>
<p>Fight&#x27;s fun with them. An&#x27; this big scrap&#x27;s made the days howlin&#x27;</p>
<p>success. what did I tell you!--look over at that table there.&quot;</p>
<p>A group of disheveled men and women, still breathing heavily,</p>
<p>were shaking hands all around.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, let&#x27;s dance,&quot; Mary pleaded, urging them in the</p>
<p>direction of the pavilion.</p>
<p>All over the park the warring bricklayers were shaking hands and</p>
<p>making up, while the open-air bars were crowded with the</p>
<p>drinkers.</p>
<p>Saxon walked very close to Billy. She was proud of him. He could</p>
<p>fight, and he could avoid trouble. In all that had occurred he</p>
<p>had striven to avoid trouble. And, also, consideration for her</p>
<p>and Mary had been uppermost in his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;You are brave,&quot; she said to him.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s like takin&#x27; candy from a baby,&quot; he disclaimed. &quot;They only</p>
<p>rough-house. They don&#x27;t know boxin&#x27;. They&#x27;re wide open, an&#x27; all</p>
<p>you gotta do is hit &#x27;em. It ain&#x27;t real fightin&#x27;, you know.&quot; With</p>
<p>a troubled, boyish look in his eyes, he stared at his bruised</p>
<p>knuckles. &quot;An&#x27; I&#x27;ll have to drive team to-morrow with &#x27;em,&quot; he</p>
<p>lamented. &quot;Which ain&#x27;t fun, I&#x27;m tellin&#x27; you, when they stiffen</p>
<p>up.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>At eight o&#x27;clock the Al Vista band played &quot;Home, Sweet Home,&quot;</p>
<p>and, following the hurried rush through the twilight to the</p>
<p>picnic train, the four managed to get double seats facing each</p>
<p>other. When the aisles and platforms were packed by the hilarious</p>
<p>crowd, the train pulled out for the short run from the suburbs</p>
<p>into Oakland. All the car was singing a score of songs at once,</p>
<p>and Bert, his head pillowed on Mary&#x27;s breast with her arms around</p>
<p>him, started &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash.&quot; And he sang the song</p>
<p>through, undeterred by the bedlam of two general fights, one on</p>
<p>the adjacent platform, the other at the opposite end of the car,</p>
<p>both of which were finally subdued by special policemen to the</p>
<p>screams of women and the crash of glass.</p>
<p>Billy sang a lugubrious song of many stanzas about a cowboy, the</p>
<p>refrain of which was, &quot;Bury me out on the lone pr-rairie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s one you never heard before; my father used to sing it,&quot;</p>
<p>he told Saxon, who was glad that it was ended.</p>
<p>She had discovered the first flaw in him. He was tonedeaf. Not</p>
<p>once had he been on the key.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t sing often,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;You bet your sweet life he don&#x27;t,&quot; Bert exclaimed. &quot;His</p>
<p>friends&#x27;d kill him if he did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They all make fun of my singin&#x27;,&quot; he complained to Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Honest, now, do you find it as rotten as all that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It &#x27;s...it&#x27;s maybe flat a bit,&quot; she admitted reluctantly.</p>
<p>&quot;It don&#x27;t sound flat to me,&quot; he protested. &quot;It&#x27;s a regular josh</p>
<p>on me. I&#x27;ll bet Bert put you up to it. You sing something now,</p>
<p>Saxon. I bet you sing good. I can tell it from lookin&#x27; at you.&quot;</p>
<p>She began &quot;When the Harvest Days Are Over.&quot; Bert and Mary joined</p>
<p>in; but when Billy attempted to add his voice he was dissuaded by</p>
<p>a shin-kick from Bert. Saxon sang in a clear, true soprano, thin</p>
<p>but sweet, and she was aware that she was singing to Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Now THAT is singing what is,&quot; he proclaimed, when she had</p>
<p>finished. &quot;Sing it again. Aw, go on. You do it just right. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>great.&quot;</p>
<p>His hand slipped to hers and gathered it in, and as she sang</p>
<p>again she felt the tide of his strength flood warmingly through</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at &#x27;em holdin&#x27; hands,&quot; Bert jeered. &quot;Just a-holdin&#x27; hands</p>
<p>like they was afraid. Look at Mary an&#x27; me, Come on an&#x27; kick in,</p>
<p>you cold-feets. Get together. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;ll look</p>
<p>suspicious. I got my suspicions already. You&#x27;re framin&#x27; somethin&#x27;</p>
<p>up.&quot;</p>
<p>Thers was no mistaking his innuendo, and Saxon felt her cheeks</p>
<p>flaming.</p>
<p>&quot;Get onto yourself, Bert,&quot; Billy reproved.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up!&quot; Mary added the weight of her indignation. &quot;You&#x27;re</p>
<p>awfully raw, Bert Wanhope, an&#x27; I won&#x27;t have anything more to do</p>
<p>with you--there!&quot;</p>
<p>She withdrew her arms and shoved him away, only to receive him</p>
<p>forgivingly half a dozen seconds afterward.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, the four of us,&quot; Bert went on irrepressibly. &quot;The</p>
<p>night&#x27;s young. Let&#x27;s make a time of it--Pabst&#x27;s Cafe first, and</p>
<p>then some. What you say, Bill? What you say, Saxon? Mary&#x27;s game.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon waited and wondered, half sick with apprehension of this</p>
<p>man beside her whom she had known so short a time.</p>
<p>&quot;Nope,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;I gotta get up to a hard day&#x27;s work</p>
<p>to-morrow, and I guess the girls has got to, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon forgave him his tone-deafness. Here was the kind of man she</p>
<p>always had known existed. It was for some such man that she had</p>
<p>waited. She was twenty-two, and her first marriage offer had come</p>
<p>when she was sixteen. The last had occurred only the month</p>
<p>before, from the foreman of the washing-room, and he had been</p>
<p>good and kind, but not young. But this one beside her--he was</p>
<p>strong and kind and good, and YOUNG. She was too young herself</p>
<p>not to desire youth. There would have been rest from fancy starch</p>
<p>with the foreman, but there would have been no warmth. But this</p>
<p>man beside her.... She caught herself on the verge involuntarily</p>
<p>of pressing his hand that held hers.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Bert, don&#x27;t tease he&#x27;s right,&quot; Mary was saying. &quot;We&#x27;ve got</p>
<p>to get some sleep. It&#x27;s fancy starch to-morrow, and all day on</p>
<p>our feet.&quot;</p>
<p>It came to Saxon with a chill pang that she was surely older than</p>
<p>Billy. She stole glances at the smoothness of his face, and the</p>
<p>essential boyishness of him, so much desired, shocked her. Of</p>
<p>course he would marry some girl years younger than himself, than</p>
<p>herself. How old was he? Could it be that he was too young for</p>
<p>her? As he seemed to grow insecessible, she was drawn toward him</p>
<p>more compellingly. He was so strong, so gentle. She lived over</p>
<p>the events of the day. There was no flaw there. He had considered</p>
<p>her and Mary, always. And he had torn the program up and danced</p>
<p>only with her. Surely he had liked her, or he would not have done</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>She slightly moved her hand in his and felt the harsh contact of</p>
<p>his teamster callouses. The sensation was exquisite. He, too,</p>
<p>moved his hand, to accommodate the shift of hers, and she waited</p>
<p>fearfully. She did not want him to prove like other men, and she</p>
<p>could have hated him had he dared to take advantage of that</p>
<p>slight movement of her fingers and put his arm around her. He did</p>
<p>not, and she flamed toward him. There was fineness in him. He was</p>
<p>neither rattle-brained, like Bert, nor coarse like other men she</p>
<p>had encountered. For she had had experiences, not nice, and she</p>
<p>had been made to suffer by the lack of what was termed chivalry,</p>
<p>though she, in turn, lacked that word to describe what she</p>
<p>divined and desired.</p>
<p>And he was a prizefighter. The thought of it almost made her</p>
<p>gasp. Yet he answered not at all to her conception of a</p>
<p>prizefighter. But, then, he wasn&#x27;t a prizefighter. He had said he</p>
<p>was not. She resolved to ask him about it some time if . . . if</p>
<p>he took her out again. Yet there was little doubt of that, for</p>
<p>when a man danced with one girl a whole day he did not drop her</p>
<p>immediately. Almost she hoped that he was a prizefighter. There</p>
<p>was a delicious tickle of wickedness about it. Prizefighters were</p>
<p>such terrible and mysterious men. In so far as they were out of</p>
<p>the ordinary and were not mere common workingmen such as</p>
<p>carpenters and laundrymen, they represented romance. Power also</p>
<p>they represented. They did not work for bosses, but spectacularly</p>
<p>and magnificently, with their own might, grappled with the great</p>
<p>world and wrung splendid living from its reluctant hands. Some of</p>
<p>them even owned automobiles and traveled with a retinue of</p>
<p>trainers and servants. Perhaps it had been only Billy&#x27;s modesty</p>
<p>that made him say he had quit fighting. And yet, there were the</p>
<p>callouses on his hands. That showed he had quit.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>They said good-bye at the gate. Billy betrayed awkwardness that</p>
<p>was sweet to Saxon. He was not one of the take-it-for-granted</p>
<p>young men. There was a pause, while she feigned desire to go into</p>
<p>the house, yet waited in secret eagerness for the words she</p>
<p>wanted him to say.</p>
<p>&quot;When am I goin&#x27; to see you again?&quot; he asked, holding her hand in</p>
<p>his.</p>
<p>She laughed consentingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I live &#x27;way up in East Oakland,&quot; he explained. &quot;You know there&#x27;s</p>
<p>where the stable is, an&#x27; most of our teaming is done in that</p>
<p>section, so I don&#x27;t knock around down this way much. But, say--&quot;</p>
<p>His hand tightened on hers. &quot;We just gotta dance together some</p>
<p>more. I&#x27;ll tell you, the Orindore Club has its dance Wednesday.</p>
<p>If you haven&#x27;t a date--have you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then Wednesday. What time&#x27;ll I come for you?&quot;</p>
<p>And when they had arranged the details, and he had agreed that</p>
<p>she should dance some of the dances with the other fellows, and</p>
<p>said good night again, his hand closed more tightly on hers and</p>
<p>drew her toward him. She resisted slightly, but honestly. It was</p>
<p>the custom, but she felt she ought not for fear he might</p>
<p>misunderstand. And yet she wanted to kiss him as she had never</p>
<p>wanted to kiss a man. When it came, her face upturned to his, she</p>
<p>realized that on his part it was an honest kiss. There hinted</p>
<p>nothing behind it. Rugged and kind as himself, it was virginal</p>
<p>almost, and betrayed no long practice in the art of saying</p>
<p>good-bye. All men were not brutes after all, was her thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Good night,&quot; she murmured; the gate screeched under her hand;</p>
<p>and she hurried along the narrow walk that led around to the</p>
<p>corner of the house.</p>
<p>&quot;Wednesday,&quot; he celled softly.</p>
<p>&quot;Wednesday,&quot; she answered.</p>
<p>But in the shadow of the narrow alley between the two houses she</p>
<p>stood still and pleasured in the ring of his foot falls down the</p>
<p>cement sidewalk. Not until they had quite died away did she go</p>
<p>on. She crept up the back stairs and across the kitchen to her</p>
<p>room, registering her thanksgiving that Sarah was asleep.</p>
<p>She lighted the gas, and, as she removed the little velvet hat,</p>
<p>she felt her lips still tingling with the kiss. Yet it had meant</p>
<p>nothing. It was the way of the young men. They all did it. But</p>
<p>their good-night kisses had never tingled, while this one tingled</p>
<p>in her brain as wall as on her lip. What was it? What did it</p>
<p>mean? With a sudden impulse she looked at herself in the glass.</p>
<p>The eyes were happy and bright. The color that tinted her cheeks</p>
<p>so easily was in them and glowing. It was a pretty reflection,</p>
<p>and she smiled, partly in joy, partly in appreciation, and the</p>
<p>smile grew at sight of the even rows of strong white teeth. Why</p>
<p>shouldn&#x27;t Billy like that face? was her unvoiced query. Other men</p>
<p>had liked it. Other men did like it. Even the other girls</p>
<p>admitted she was a good-looker. Charley Long certainly liked it</p>
<p>from the way he made life miserable for her.</p>
<p>She glanced aside to the rim of the looking-glass where his</p>
<p>photograph was wedged, shuddered, and made a moue of distaste.</p>
<p>There was cruelty in those eyes, and brutishness. He was a brute.</p>
<p>For a year, now, he had bullied her. Other fellows were afraid to</p>
<p>go with her. He warned them off. She had been forced into almost</p>
<p>slavery to his attentions. She remembered the young bookkeeper at</p>
<p>the laundry--not a workingman, but a soft-handed, soft-voiced</p>
<p>gentleman--whom Charley had beaten up at the corner because he</p>
<p>had been bold enough to come to take her to the theater. And she</p>
<p>had been helpless. For his own sake she had never dared accept</p>
<p>another invitation to go out with him.</p>
<p>And now, Wednesday night, she was going with Billy. Billy! Her</p>
<p>heart leaped. There would be trouble, but Billy would save her</p>
<p>from him. She&#x27;d like to see him try and beat Billy up.</p>
<p>With a quick movement, she jerked the photograph from its niche</p>
<p>and threw it face down upon the chest of drawers. It fell beside</p>
<p>a small square case of dark and tarnished leather. With a feeling</p>
<p>as of profanation she again seized the offending photograph and</p>
<p>flung it across the room into a corner. At the same time she</p>
<p>picked up the leather case. Springing it open, she gazed at the</p>
<p>daguerreotype of a worn little woman with steady gray eyes and a</p>
<p>hopeful, pathetic mouth. Opposite, on the velvet lining, done in</p>
<p>gold lettering, was, CARLTON FROM DAISY. She read it reverently,</p>
<p>for it represented the father she had never known, and the mother</p>
<p>she had so little known, though she could never forget that those</p>
<p>wise sad eyes were gray.</p>
<p>Despite lack of conventional religion, Saxon&#x27;s nature was deeply</p>
<p>religious. Her thoughts of God were vague and nebulous, and there</p>
<p>she was frankly puzzled. She could not vision God. Here, in the</p>
<p>daguerreotype, was the concrete; much she had grasped from it,</p>
<p>and always there seemed an infinite more to grasp. She did not go</p>
<p>to church. This was her high altar and holy of holies. She came</p>
<p>to it in trouble, in loneliness, for counsel, divination, end</p>
<p>comfort. In so far as she found herself different from the girls</p>
<p>of her acquaintance, she quested here to try to identify her</p>
<p>characteristics in the pictured face. Her mother had been</p>
<p>different from other women, too. This, forsooth, meant to her</p>
<p>what God meant to others. To this she strove to be true, and not</p>
<p>to hurt nor vex. And how little she really knew of her mother,</p>
<p>and of how much was conjecture and surmise, she was unaware; for</p>
<p>it was through many years she had erected this mother-myth.</p>
<p>Yet was it all myth? She resented the doubt with quick jealousy,</p>
<p>and, opening the bottom drawer of the chest, drew forth a</p>
<p>battered portfolio. Out rolled manuscripts, faded and worn, and</p>
<p>arose a faint far scent of sweet-kept age. The writing was</p>
<p>delicate and curled, with the quaint fineness of half a century</p>
<p>before. She read a stanza to herself:</p>
<p>&quot;Sweet as a wind-lute&#x27;s airy strains</p>
<p>Your gentle muse has learned to sing,</p>
<p>And California&#x27;s boundless plains</p>
<p>Prolong the soft notes echoing.&quot;</p>
<p>She wondered, for the thousandth time, what a windlute was; yet</p>
<p>much of beauty, much of beyondness, she sensed of this dimly</p>
<p>remembered beautiful mother of hers. She communed a while, then</p>
<p>unrolled a second manuscript. &quot;To C. B.,&quot; it read. To Carlton</p>
<p>Brown, she knew, to her father, a love-poem from her mother.</p>
<p>Saxon pondered the opening lines:</p>
<p>&quot;I have stolen away from the crowd in the groves,</p>
<p>Where the nude statues stand, and the leaves point and shiver</p>
<p>At ivy-crowned Bacchus, the Queen of the Loves,</p>
<p>Pandora and Psyche, struck voiceless forever.&quot;</p>
<p>This, too, was beyond her. But she breathed the beauty of it.</p>
<p>Bacchus, and Pandora and Psyche--talismans to conjure with! But</p>
<p>alas! the necromancy was her mother&#x27;s. Strange, meaningless words</p>
<p>that meant so much! Her marvelous mother had known their meaning.</p>
<p>Saxon spelled the three words aloud, letter by letter, for she</p>
<p>did not dare their pronunciation; and in her consciousness</p>
<p>glimmered august connotations, profound and unthinkable. Her mind</p>
<p>stumbled and halted on the star-bright and dazzling boundaries of</p>
<p>a world beyond her world in which her mother had roamed at will.</p>
<p>Again and again, solemnly, she went over the four lines. They</p>
<p>were radiance and light to the world, haunted with phantoms of</p>
<p>pain and unrest, in which she had her being. There, hidden among</p>
<p>those cryptic singing lines, was the clue. If she could only</p>
<p>grasp it, all would be made clear. Of this she was sublimely</p>
<p>confident. She would understand Sarah&#x27;s sharp tongue, her unhappy</p>
<p>brother, the cruelty of Charley Long, the justness of the</p>
<p>bookkeeper&#x27;s beating, the day-long, month-long, year-long toil at</p>
<p>the ironing-board.</p>
<p>She skipped a stanza that she knew was hopelessly beyond her, and</p>
<p>tried again:</p>
<p>&quot;The dusk of the greenhouse is luminous yet</p>
<p>With quivers of opal and tremors of gold;</p>
<p>For the sun is at rest, and the light from the west,</p>
<p>Like delicate wine that is mellow and old,</p>
<p>&quot;Flushes faintly the brow of a naiad that stands</p>
<p>In the spray of a fountain, whose seed-amethysts</p>
<p>Tremble lightly a moment on bosom and hands,</p>
<p>Then dip in their basin from bosom and wrists.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful, just beautiful,&quot; she sighed. And then, appalled</p>
<p>at the length of all the poem, at the volume of the mystery, she</p>
<p>rolled the manuscript and put it away. Again she dipped in the</p>
<p>drawer, seeking the clue among the cherished fragments of her</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s hidden soul.</p>
<p>This time it was a small package, wrapped in tissue paper and</p>
<p>tied with ribbon. She opened it carefully, with the deep gravity</p>
<p>and circumstance of a priest before an altar. Appeared a little</p>
<p>red-satin Spanish girdle, whale-boned like a tiny corset,</p>
<p>pointed, the pioneer finery of a frontier woman who had crossed</p>
<p>the plains. It was hand-made after the California-Spanish model</p>
<p>of forgotten days. The very whalebone had been home-shaped of the</p>
<p>raw material from the whaleships traded for in hides and tallow.</p>
<p>The black lace trimming her mother had made. The triple edging of</p>
<p>black velvet strips--her mother&#x27;s hands had sewn the stitches.</p>
<p>Saxon dreamed over it in a maze of incoherent thought. This was</p>
<p>concrete. This she understood. This she worshiped as man-created</p>
<p>gods have been worshiped on less tangible evidence of their</p>
<p>sojourn on earth.</p>
<p>Twenty-two inches it measured around. She knew it out of many</p>
<p>verifications. She stood up and put it about her waist. This was</p>
<p>part of the ritual. It almost met. In places it did meet. Without</p>
<p>her dress it would meet everywhere as it had met on her mother.</p>
<p>Closest of all, this survival of old California-Ventura days</p>
<p>brought Saxon in touch. Hers was her mother&#x27;s form. Physically,</p>
<p>she was like her mother. Her grit, her ability to turn off work</p>
<p>that was such an amazement to others, were her mother&#x27;s. Just so</p>
<p>had her mother been an amazement to her generation--her mother,</p>
<p>the toy-like creature, the smallest and tha youngest of the</p>
<p>strapping pioneer brood, who nevertheless had mothered the brood.</p>
<p>Always it had been her wisdom that was sought, even by the</p>
<p>brothers and sisters a dozen years her senior. Daisy, it was, who</p>
<p>had put her tiny foot down and commanded the removal from the</p>
<p>fever flatlands of Colusa to the healthy mountains of Ventura;</p>
<p>who had backed the savage old Indian-fighter of a father into a</p>
<p>corner and fought the entire family that Vila might marry the man</p>
<p>of her choice; who had flown in the face of the family and of</p>
<p>community morality and demanded the divorce of Laura from her</p>
<p>criminally weak husband; and who on the other hand, had held the</p>
<p>branches of the family together when only misunderstanding and</p>
<p>weak humanness threatened to drive them apart.</p>
<p>The peacemaker and the warrior! All the old tales trooped before</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s eyes. They were sharp with detail, for she had visioned</p>
<p>them many times, though their content was of things she had never</p>
<p>seen. So far as details were concerned, they were her own</p>
<p>creation, for she had never seen an ox, a wild Indian, nor a</p>
<p>prairie schooner. Yet, palpitating and real, shimmering in the</p>
<p>sun-flashed dust of ten thousand hoofs, she saw pass, from East</p>
<p>to West, across a continent, the great hegira of the land-hungry</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon. It was part and fiber of her. She had been nursed on</p>
<p>its traditions and its facts from the lips of those who had taken</p>
<p>part. Clearly she saw the long wagon-train, the lean, gaunt men</p>
<p>who walked before, the youths goading the lowing oxen that fell</p>
<p>and were goaded to their feet to fall again. And through it all,</p>
<p>a flying shuttle, weaving the golden dazzling thread of</p>
<p>personality, moved the form of her little, indomitable mother,</p>
<p>eight years old, and nine ere the great traverse was ended, a</p>
<p>necromancer and a law-giver, willing her way, and the way and the</p>
<p>willing always good and right.</p>
<p>Saxon saw Punch, the little, rough-coated Skye-terrier with the</p>
<p>honest eyes (who had plodded for weary months), gone lame and</p>
<p>abandoned; she saw Daisy, the chit of a child, hide Punch in the</p>
<p>wagon. She saw the savage old worried father discover the added</p>
<p>burden of the several pounds to the dying oxen. She saw his</p>
<p>wrath, as he held Punch by the scruff of the neck. And she saw</p>
<p>Daisy, between the muzzle of the long-barreled rifle and the</p>
<p>little dog. And she saw Daisy thereafter, through days of alkali</p>
<p>and heat, walking, stumbling, in the dust of the wagons, the</p>
<p>little sick dog, like a baby, in her arms.</p>
<p>But most vivid of all, Saxon saw the fight at Little Meadow--and</p>
<p>Daisy, dressed as for a gala day, in white, a ribbon sash about</p>
<p>her waist, ribbons and a round-comb in her hair, in her hands</p>
<p>small water-pails, step forth into the sunshine on the</p>
<p>flower-grown open ground from the wagon circle, wheels</p>
<p>interlocked, where the wounded screamed their delirium and</p>
<p>babbled of flowing fountains, and go on, through the sunshine and</p>
<p>the wonder-inhibition of the bullet-dealing Indians, a hundred</p>
<p>yards to the waterhole and back again.</p>
<p>Saxon kissed the little, red satin Spanish girdle passionately,</p>
<p>and wrapped it up in haste, with dewy eyes, abandoning the</p>
<p>mystery and godhead of mother and all the strange enigma of</p>
<p>living.</p>
<p>In bed, she projected against her closed eyelids the few rich</p>
<p>scenes of her mother that her child-memory retained. It was her</p>
<p>favorite way of wooing sleep. She had done it all her life--sunk</p>
<p>into the death-blackness of sleep with her mother limned to the</p>
<p>last on her fading consciousness. But this mother was not the</p>
<p>Daisy of the plains nor of the daguerreotype. They had been</p>
<p>before Saxon&#x27;s time. This that she saw nightly was an older</p>
<p>mother, broken with insomnia and brave with sorrow, who crept,</p>
<p>always crept, a pale, frail creature, gentle and unfaltering,</p>
<p>dying from lack of sleep, living by will, and by will refraining</p>
<p>from going mad, who, nevertheless, could not will sleep, and whom</p>
<p>not even the whole tribe of doctors could make sleep.</p>
<p>Crept--always she crept, about the house, from weary bed to weary</p>
<p>chair and back again through long days and weeks of torment,</p>
<p>never complaining, though her unfailing smile was twisted with</p>
<p>pain, and the wise gray eyes, still wise and gray, were grown</p>
<p>unutterably larger and profoundly deep.</p>
<p>But on this night Saxon did not win to sleep quickly; the little</p>
<p>creeping mother came and went; and in the intervals the face of</p>
<p>Billy, with the cloud-drifted, sullen, handsome eyes, burned</p>
<p>against her eyelids. And once again, as sleep welled up to</p>
<p>smother her, she put to herself the question IS THIS THE MAN?</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>Tun work in the ironing-room slipped off, but the three days</p>
<p>until Wednesday night were very long. She hummed over the fancy</p>
<p>starch that flew under the iron at an astounding rate.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t see how you do it,&quot; Mary admired. &quot;You&#x27;ll make thirteen</p>
<p>or fourteen this week at that rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon laughed, and in the steam from the iron she saw dancing</p>
<p>golden letters that spelled WEDNESDAY.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think of Billy?&quot; Mary asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I like him,&quot; was the frank answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, don&#x27;t let it go farther than that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will if I want to,&quot; Saxon retorted gaily.</p>
<p>&quot;Better not,&quot; came the warning. &quot;You&#x27;ll only make trouble for</p>
<p>yourself. He ain&#x27;t marryin&#x27;. Many a girl&#x27;s found that out. They</p>
<p>just throw themselves at his head, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not going to throw myself at him, or any other man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just thought I&#x27;d tell you,&quot; Mary concluded. &quot;A word to the</p>
<p>wise.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon had become grave.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s not . . . not . . .&quot; she began, than looked the</p>
<p>significance of the question she could not complete.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, nothin&#x27; like that--though there&#x27;s nothin&#x27; to stop him. He&#x27;s</p>
<p>straight, all right, all right. But he just won&#x27;t fall for</p>
<p>anything in skirts. He dances, an&#x27; runs around, an&#x27; has a good</p>
<p>time, an&#x27; beyond that--nitsky. A lot of &#x27;em&#x27;s got fooled on him.</p>
<p>I bet you there&#x27;s a dozen girls in love with him right now. An&#x27;</p>
<p>he just goes on turnin&#x27; &#x27;em down. There was Lily Sanderson--you</p>
<p>know her. You seen her at that Slavonic picnic last summer at</p>
<p>Shellmound--that tall, nice-lookin&#x27; blonde that was with Butch</p>
<p>Willows?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I remember her,&quot; Saxon sald. &quot;What about her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, she&#x27;d been runnin&#x27; with Butch Willows pretty steady, an&#x27;</p>
<p>just because she could dance, Billy dances a lot with her. Butch</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t afraid of nothin&#x27;. He wades right in for a showdown, an&#x27;</p>
<p>nails Billy outside, before everybody, an&#x27; reads the riot act.</p>
<p>An&#x27; Billy listens in that slow, sleepy way of his, an&#x27; Butch gets</p>
<p>hotter an&#x27; hotter, an&#x27; everybody expects a scrap.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; then Billy says to Butch, &#x27;Are you done?&#x27; &#x27;Yes,&#x27; Butch says;</p>
<p>&#x27;I&#x27;ve said my say, an&#x27; what are you goin&#x27; to do about it?&#x27; An&#x27;</p>
<p>Billy says--an&#x27; what d&#x27;ye think he said, with everybody lookin&#x27;</p>
<p>on an&#x27; Butch with blood in his eye? Well, he said, &#x27;I guess</p>
<p>nothin&#x27;, Butch.&#x27; Just like that. Butch was that surprised you</p>
<p>could knocked him over with a feather. &#x27;An&#x27; never dance with her</p>
<p>no more?&#x27; he says. &#x27;Not if you say I can&#x27;t, Butch,&#x27; Billy says.</p>
<p>Just like that.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you know, any other man to take water the way he did from</p>
<p>Butch--why, everybody&#x27;d despise him. But not Billy. You see, he</p>
<p>can afford to. He&#x27;s got a rep as a fighter, an&#x27; when he just</p>
<p>stood back &#x27;an&#x27; let Butch have his way, everybody knew he wasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>scared, or backin&#x27; down, or anything. He didn&#x27;t care a rap for</p>
<p>Lily Sanderson, that was all, an&#x27; anybody could see she was just</p>
<p>crazy after him.&quot;</p>
<p>The telling of this episode caused Saxon no little worry. Hers</p>
<p>was the average woman&#x27;s pride, but in the matter of</p>
<p>man-conquering prowess she was not unduly conceited. Billy had</p>
<p>enjoyed her dancing, and she wondered if that were all. If</p>
<p>Charley Long bullied up to him would he let her go as he had let</p>
<p>Lily Sanderson go? He was not a marrying man; nor could Saxon</p>
<p>blind her eyes to the fact that he was eminently marriageable. No</p>
<p>wonder the girls ran after him. And he was a man-subduer as well</p>
<p>as a woman-subduer. Men liked him. Bert Wanhope seemed actually</p>
<p>to love him. She remembered the Butchertown tough in the</p>
<p>dining-room at Weasel Park who had come over to the table to</p>
<p>apologize, and the Irishman at the tug-of-war who had abandoned</p>
<p>all thought of fighting with him the moment he learned his</p>
<p>identity.</p>
<p>A very much spoiled young man was a thought that flitted</p>
<p>frequently through Saxon&#x27;s mind; and each time she condemned it</p>
<p>as ungenerous. He was gentle in that tantalizing slow way of his.</p>
<p>Despite his strength, he did not walk rough-shod over others.</p>
<p>There was the affair with Lily Sanderson. Saxon analysed it again</p>
<p>and again. He had not cared for the girl, and he had immediately</p>
<p>stepped from between her and Butch. It was just the thing that</p>
<p>Bert, out of sheer wickedness and love of trouble, would not have</p>
<p>done. There would have been a fight, hard feelings, Butch turned</p>
<p>into an enemy, and nothing profited to Lily. But Billy had done</p>
<p>the right thing--done it slowly and imperturbably and with the</p>
<p>least hurt to everybody. All of which made him more desirable to</p>
<p>Saxon and less possible.</p>
<p>She bought another pair of silk stockings that she had hesitated</p>
<p>at for weeks, and on Tuesday night sewed and drowsed wearily over</p>
<p>a new shirtwaist and earned complaint from Sarah concerning her</p>
<p>extravagant use of gas.</p>
<p>Wednesday night, at the Orindore dance, was not all undiluted</p>
<p>pleasure. It was shameless the way the girls made up to Billy,</p>
<p>and, at times, Saxon found his easy consideration for them almost</p>
<p>irritating. Yet she was compelled to acknowledge to herself that</p>
<p>he hurt none of the other fellows&#x27; feelings in the way the girls</p>
<p>hurt hers. They all but asked him outright to dance with them,</p>
<p>and little of their open pursuit of him escaped her eyes. She</p>
<p>resolved that she would not be guilty of throwing herself at him,</p>
<p>and withheld dance after dance, and yet was secretly and</p>
<p>thrillingly aware that she was pursuing the right tactics. She</p>
<p>deliberately demonstrated that she was desirable to other men, as</p>
<p>he involuntarily demonstrated his own desirableness to the women.</p>
<p>Her happiness came when he coolly overrode her objections and</p>
<p>insisted on two dances more than she had allotted him. And she</p>
<p>was pleased, as well as angered, when she chanced to overhear two</p>
<p>of the strapping young cannery girls. &quot;The way that little</p>
<p>sawed-off is monopolizin&#x27; him,&quot; said one. And the other: &quot;You&#x27;d</p>
<p>think she might have the good taste to run after somebody of her</p>
<p>own age.&quot; &quot;Cradle-snatcher,&quot; was the final sting that sent the</p>
<p>angry blood into Saxon&#x27;s cheeks as the two girls moved away,</p>
<p>unaware that they had been overheard.</p>
<p>Billy saw her home, kissed her at the gate, and got her consent</p>
<p>to go with him to the dance at Germania Hall on Friday night.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn&#x27;t thinkin&#x27; of goin&#x27;,&quot; he sald. &quot;But if you&#x27;ll say the</p>
<p>word . . . Bert&#x27;s goin&#x27; to be there.&quot;</p>
<p>Next day, at the ironing boards, Mary told her that she and Bert</p>
<p>were dated for Germania Hall.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you goin&#x27;?&quot; Mary asked.</p>
<p>Saxon nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Billy Roberts?&quot;</p>
<p>The nod was repeated, and Mary, with suspended iron, gave her a</p>
<p>long and curions look.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, an&#x27; what if Charley Long butts in?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>They ironed swiftly and silently for a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Mary decided, &quot;if he does butt in maybe he&#x27;ll get his.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d like to see him get it--the big stiff! It all depends how</p>
<p>Billy feels--about you, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m no Lily Sanderson,&quot; Saxon answered indignantly. &quot;I&#x27;ll never</p>
<p>give Billy Roberts a chance to turn me down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will, if Charley Long butts in. Take it from me, Saxon, he</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t no gentleman. Look what he done to Mr. Moody. That was a</p>
<p>awful beatin&#x27;. An&#x27; Mr. Moody only a quiet little man that</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t harm a fly. Well, he won&#x27;t find Billy Roberts a sissy by</p>
<p>a long shot.&quot;</p>
<p>That night, outside the laundry entrance, Saxon found Charley</p>
<p>Long waiting. As he stepped forward to greet her and walk</p>
<p>alongside, she felt the sickening palpitation that he had so</p>
<p>thoroughly taught her to know. The blood ebbed from her face with</p>
<p>the apprehension and fear his appearance caused. She was afraid</p>
<p>of the rough bulk of the man; of the heavy brown eyes, dominant</p>
<p>and confident; of the big blacksmith-hands and the thick strong</p>
<p>fingers with the hair-pads on the back to every first joint. He</p>
<p>was unlovely to the eye, and he was unlovely to all her finer</p>
<p>sensibilities. It was not his strength itself, but the quality of</p>
<p>it and the misuse of it, that affronted her. The beating he had</p>
<p>given the gentle Mr. Moody had meant half-hours of horror to her</p>
<p>afterward. Always did the memory of it come to her accompanied by</p>
<p>a shudder. And yet, without shock, she had seen Billy fight at</p>
<p>Weasel Park in the same primitive man-animal way. But it had been</p>
<p>ditferent. She recognized, but could not analyze, the difference.</p>
<p>She was aware only of the brutishness of this man&#x27;s hands and</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re lookin&#x27; white an&#x27; all beat to a frazzle,&quot; he was saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#x27;t you cut the work? You got to some time, anyway. You</p>
<p>can&#x27;t lose me, kid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I could,&quot; she replied.</p>
<p>He laughed with harsh joviality. &quot;Nothin&#x27; to it, Saxon. You&#x27;re</p>
<p>just cut out to be Mrs. Long, an&#x27; you&#x27;re sure goin&#x27; to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish I was as certain about all things as you are,&quot; she said</p>
<p>with mild sarcasm that missed.</p>
<p>&quot;Take it from me,&quot; he went on, &quot;there&#x27;s just one thing you can be</p>
<p>certain of--an&#x27; that is that I am certain.&quot; He was pleased with</p>
<p>the cleverness of his idea and laughed approvingly. &quot;When I go</p>
<p>after anything I get it, an&#x27; if anything gets in between it gets</p>
<p>hurt. D&#x27;ye get that? It&#x27;s me for you, an&#x27; that&#x27;s all there is to</p>
<p>it, so you might as well make up your mind and go to workin&#x27; in</p>
<p>my home instead of the laundry. Why, it&#x27;s a snap. There wouldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>be much to do. I make good money, an&#x27; you wouldn&#x27;t want for</p>
<p>anything. You know, I just washed up from work an&#x27; skinned over</p>
<p>here to tell it to you once more, so you wouldn&#x27;t forget. I ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>ate yet, an&#x27; that shows how much I think of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;d better go and eat then,&quot; she advised, though she knew the</p>
<p>futility of attempting to get rid of him.</p>
<p>She scarcely heard what he said. It had come upon her suddenly</p>
<p>that she was very tired and very small and very weak alongside</p>
<p>this colossus of a man. Would he dog her always? she asked</p>
<p>despairingly, and seemed to glimpse a vision of all her future</p>
<p>life stretched out before her, with always the form and face of</p>
<p>the burly blacksmith pursuing her.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, kid, an&#x27; kick in,&quot; he continued. &quot;It&#x27;s the good old</p>
<p>summer time, an&#x27; that&#x27;s the time to get married.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I&#x27;m not going to marry you,&quot; she protested. &quot;I&#x27;ve told you a</p>
<p>thousand times already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, forget it. You want to get them ideas out of your think-box.</p>
<p>Of course, you&#x27;re goin&#x27; to marry me. It&#x27;s a pipe. An&#x27; I&#x27;ll tell</p>
<p>you another pipe. You an&#x27; me&#x27;s goin&#x27; acrost to Frisco Friday</p>
<p>night. There&#x27;s goin&#x27; to he big doin&#x27;s with the Horseshoers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only I&#x27;m not,&quot; she contradicted.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes you are,&quot; he asserted with absolute assurance. &quot;We&#x27;ll</p>
<p>eatch the last boat back, an&#x27; you&#x27;ll have one fine time. An&#x27; I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>put you next to some of the good dancers. Oh, I ain&#x27;t a pincher,</p>
<p>an&#x27; I know you like dancin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I tell you I can&#x27;t,&quot; she reiterated.</p>
<p>He shot a glance of suspicion at her from under the black thatch</p>
<p>of brows that met above his nose and were as one brow.</p>
<p>&quot;Why can&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A date,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Who&#x27;s the bloke?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None of your business, Charley Long. I&#x27;ve got a date, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll make it my business. Remember that lah-de-dah bookkeeper</p>
<p>rummy? Well, just keep on rememborin&#x27; him an&#x27; what he got.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish yon&#x27;d leave me alone,&quot; she pleaded resentfully. &quot;Can&#x27;t</p>
<p>you be kind just for once?&quot;</p>
<p>The blacksmith laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&quot;If any rummy thinks he can butt in on you an&#x27; me, he&#x27;ll learn</p>
<p>different, an&#x27; I&#x27;m the little boy that&#x27;ll learn &#x27;m.--Fridey</p>
<p>night, eh? Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won&#x27;t tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; he repeated.</p>
<p>Her lips were drawn in tight silence, and in her cheeks were</p>
<p>little angry spots of blood.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!--As if I couldn&#x27;t guess! Germania Hall. Well, I&#x27;ll be</p>
<p>there, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll take you home afterward. D&#x27;ye get that? An&#x27; you&#x27;d</p>
<p>better tell the rummy to beat it unless you want to see&#x27;m get his</p>
<p>face hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon, hurt as a prideful woman can be hurt by cavalier</p>
<p>treatment, was tempted to cry out the name and prowess of her</p>
<p>new-found protector. And then came fear. This was a big man, and</p>
<p>Billy was only a boy. That was the way he affected her. She</p>
<p>remembered her first impression of his hands and glanced quickly</p>
<p>at the hands of the man beside her. They seemed twice as large as</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s, and the mats of hair seemed to advertise a terrible</p>
<p>strength. No, Billy could not fight this big brute. He must not.</p>
<p>And then to Saxon came a wicked little hope that by the</p>
<p>mysterious and unthinkable ability that prizefighters possessed,</p>
<p>Billy might be able to whip this bully and rid her of him. With</p>
<p>the next glance doubt came again, for her eye dwelt on the</p>
<p>blacksmith&#x27;s broad shoulders, the cloth of the coat</p>
<p>muscle-wrinkled and the sleeves bulging above the biceps.</p>
<p>&quot;If you lay a hand on anybody I&#x27;m going with again---&quot; she began.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, they&#x27;ll get hurt, of course,&quot; Long grinned. &quot;And they&#x27;ll</p>
<p>deserve it, too. Any rummy that comes between a fellow an&#x27; his</p>
<p>girl ought to get hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I&#x27;m not your girl, and all your saying so doesn&#x27;t make it</p>
<p>so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, get mad,&quot; he approved. &quot;I like you for that, too.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ve got spunk an&#x27; fight. I like to see it. It&#x27;s what a man</p>
<p>needs in his wife--and not these fat cows of women. They&#x27;re the</p>
<p>dead ones. Now you&#x27;re a live one, all wool, a yard long and a</p>
<p>yard wide.&quot;</p>
<p>She stopped before the house and put her hand on the gate.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#x27;m going in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on out afterward for a run to Idora Park,&quot; he suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I&#x27;m not feeling good, and I&#x27;m going straight to bed as soon</p>
<p>as I eat supper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!&quot; he sneered. &quot;Gettin&#x27; in shape for the fling to-morrow</p>
<p>night, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>With an impatient movement she opened the gate and stepped</p>
<p>inside.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve given it to you straight,&quot; he went on. &quot;If you don&#x27;t go</p>
<p>with me to-morrow night somebody&#x27;ll get hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope it will be you,&quot; she cried vindictively.</p>
<p>He laughed as he threw his head back, stretched his big chest,</p>
<p>and half-lifted his heavy arms. The action reminded her</p>
<p>disgustingly of a great ape she had once seen in a circus.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, good-bye,&quot; he said. &quot;See you to-morrow night at Germania</p>
<p>Hall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#x27;t told you it was Germania Hall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you haven&#x27;t told me it wasn&#x27;t. All the same, I&#x27;ll be there.</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ll take you home, too. Be sure an&#x27; keep plenty of round</p>
<p>dances open fer me. That&#x27;s right. Get mad. It makes you look</p>
<p>fine.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>The music stopped at the end of the waltz, leaving Billy and</p>
<p>Saxon at the big entrance doorway of the ballroom. Her hand</p>
<p>rested lightly on his arm, and they were promenading on to find</p>
<p>seats, when Charley Long, evidently just arrived, thrust his way</p>
<p>in front of them.</p>
<p>&quot;So you&#x27;re the buttinsky, eh?&quot; he demanded, his face malignant</p>
<p>with passion and menace.</p>
<p>&quot;Who?--me?&quot; Billy queried gently. &quot;Some mistake, sport. I never</p>
<p>butt in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re goin&#x27; to get your head beaten off if you don&#x27;t make</p>
<p>yourself scarce pretty lively.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want that to happen for the world,&quot; Billy drawled.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, Saxon. This neighborhood&#x27;s unhealthy for us.&quot;</p>
<p>He started to go on with her, but Long thrust in front again.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re too fresh to keep, young fellow,&quot; he snarled. &quot;You need</p>
<p>saltin&#x27; down. D&#x27;ye get me?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy scratched his head, on his face exaggerated puzzlement.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I don&#x27;t get you,&quot; he said. &quot;Now just what was it you said?&quot;</p>
<p>But the big blacksmith turned contemptuously away from him to</p>
<p>Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Come here, you. Let&#x27;s see your program.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you want to dance with him?&quot; Billy asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry, sport, nothin&#x27; doin&#x27;,&quot; Billy said, again making to start</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>For the third time the blacksmith blocked the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Get off your foot,&quot; said Billy. &quot;You&#x27;re standin&#x27; on it.&quot;</p>
<p>Long all but sprang upon him, his hands clenched, one arm just</p>
<p>starting back for the punch while at the same instant shoulders</p>
<p>and chest were coming forward. But he restrained himself at sight</p>
<p>of Billy&#x27;s unstartled body and cold and cloudy ayes. He had made</p>
<p>no move of mind or muscle. It was as if he were unaware of the</p>
<p>threatened attack. All of which constituted a new thing in Long&#x27;s</p>
<p>experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you don&#x27;t know who I am,&quot; he bullied.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep, I do,&quot; Billy answered airily. &quot;You&#x27;re a recordbreaker at</p>
<p>rough-housin&#x27;.&quot; (Here Long&#x27;s face showed pleasure.) &quot;You ought to</p>
<p>have the Police Gazette diamond belt for rough-bousin&#x27; baby</p>
<p>buggies&#x27;. I guess there ain&#x27;t a one you&#x27;re afraid to tackle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave &#x27;m alone, Charley,&quot; advised one of the young men who had</p>
<p>crowded about them. &quot;He&#x27;s Bill Roberts, the fighter. You know&#x27;m.</p>
<p>Big Bill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care if he&#x27;s Jim Jeffries. He can&#x27;t butt in on me this</p>
<p>way.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless it was noticeable, even to Saxon, that the fire had</p>
<p>gone out of his fiercenes. Billy&#x27;s name seemed to have a quieting</p>
<p>effect on obstreperous males.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know him?&quot; Billy asked her.</p>
<p>She signified yes with her eyes, though it seemed she must cry</p>
<p>out a thousand things against this man who so steadfastly</p>
<p>persecuted her. Billy turned to the blacksmith.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, sport, you don&#x27;t want trouble with me. I&#x27;ve got your</p>
<p>number. Besides, what do we want to fight for? Hasn&#x27;t she got a</p>
<p>say so in the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, she hasn&#x27;t. This is my affair an&#x27; yourn.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy shook his head slowly. &quot;No; you&#x27;re in wrong. I think she</p>
<p>has a say in the matter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, say it then,&quot; Long snarled at Saxon. &quot;who&#x27;re you goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>go with?--me or him? Let&#x27;s get it settled.&quot;</p>
<p>For reply, Saxon reached her free hand over to the hand that</p>
<p>rested on Billy&#x27;s arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Nuff said,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s remark.</p>
<p>Long glared at Saxon, then transferred the glare to her</p>
<p>protector.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve a good mind to mix it with you anyway,&quot; Long gritted</p>
<p>through his teeth.</p>
<p>Saxon was elated as they started to move away. Lily Sanderson&#x27;s</p>
<p>fate had not been hers, and her wonderful man-boy, without the</p>
<p>threat of a blow, slow of speech and imperturbable, had conquered</p>
<p>the big blacksmith.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s forced himself upon me all the time,&quot; she whispered to</p>
<p>Billy. &quot;He&#x27;s tried to run me, and beaten up every man that came</p>
<p>near me. I never want to see him again.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy halted immediately. Long, who was reluctantly moving to get</p>
<p>out of the way, also halted.</p>
<p>&quot;She says she don&#x27;t want anything more to do with you,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>said to him. &quot;An&#x27; what she says goes. If I get a whisper any time</p>
<p>that you&#x27;ve been botherin&#x27; her, I&#x27;ll attend to your case. D&#x27;ye</p>
<p>get that?&quot;</p>
<p>Long glowered and remained silent.</p>
<p>&quot;D&#x27;ye get that?&quot; Billy repeated, more imperatively.</p>
<p>A growl of assent came from the blacksmith</p>
<p>&quot;All right, then. See you remember it. An&#x27; now get outa the way</p>
<p>or I&#x27;ll walk over you.&quot;</p>
<p>Long slunk back, muttering inarticulate threats, and Saxon moved</p>
<p>on as in a dream. Charley Long had taken water. He had been</p>
<p>afraid of this smooth-skinned, blue-eyed boy. She was quit of</p>
<p>him--something no other man had dared attempt for her. And Billy</p>
<p>had liked her better than Lily Sanderson.</p>
<p>Twice Saxon tried to tell Billy the detalls of her acquaintance</p>
<p>with Long, but each time was put off.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care a rap about it,&quot; Billy said the second time.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re here, ain&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>But she insisted, and when, worked up and angry by the recital,</p>
<p>she had finished, he patted her hand soothingly.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right, Saxon,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#x27;s just a big stiff. I took</p>
<p>his measure as soon as I looked at him. He won&#x27;t bother you</p>
<p>again. I know his kind. He&#x27;s a dog. Roughhouse? He couldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>rough-house a milk wagon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how do you do it?&quot; she asked breathlessly. &quot;Why are men so</p>
<p>afraid of you? You&#x27;re just wonderful.&quot;</p>
<p>He smiled in an embarrassed way and changed the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;I like your teeth. They&#x27;re so white an&#x27; regular,</p>
<p>an&#x27; not big, an&#x27; not dinky little baby&#x27;s teeth either. They&#x27;re</p>
<p>... they&#x27;re just right, an&#x27; they fit you. I never seen such fine</p>
<p>teeth on a girl yet. D&#x27;ye know, honest, they kind of make me</p>
<p>hungry when I look at &#x27;em. They&#x27;re good enough to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>At midnight, leaving the insatiable Bert and Mary still dancing,</p>
<p>Bllly and Saxon started for home. It was on his suggestion that</p>
<p>they left early, and he felt called upon to explain.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s one thing the fightin&#x27; game&#x27;s taught me,&quot; he said. &quot;To take</p>
<p>care of myself. A fellow can&#x27;t work all day and dance all night</p>
<p>and keep in condition. It&#x27;s the same way with drinkin&#x27;--an&#x27; not</p>
<p>that I&#x27;m a little tin angel. I know what it is. I&#x27;ve been soused</p>
<p>to the guards an&#x27; all the rest of it. I like my beer--big</p>
<p>schooners of it; but I don&#x27;t drink all I want of it. I&#x27;ve tried,</p>
<p>but it don&#x27;t pay. Take that big stiff to-night that butted in on</p>
<p>us. He ought to had my number. He&#x27;s a dog anyway, but besides he</p>
<p>had beer bloat. I sized that up the first rattle, an&#x27; that&#x27;s the</p>
<p>difference about who takes the other fellow&#x27;s number. Condition,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s what it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But he is so big,&quot; Saxon protested. &quot;Why, his fists are twice as</p>
<p>big as yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That don&#x27;t mean anything. What counts is what&#x27;s behind the</p>
<p>fists. He&#x27;d turn loose like a buckin&#x27; bronco. If I couldn&#x27;t drop</p>
<p>him at the start, all I&#x27;d do is to keep away, smother up, an&#x27;</p>
<p>wait. An&#x27; all of a sudden he&#x27;d blow up--go all to pieces, you</p>
<p>know, wind, heart, everything, and then I&#x27;d have him where I</p>
<p>wanted him. And the point is he knows it, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re the first prizefighter I ever knew,&quot; Saxon said, after a</p>
<p>pause.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not any more,&quot; he disclaimed hastily. &quot;That&#x27;s one thing the</p>
<p>fightin&#x27; game taught me--to leave it alone. It don&#x27;t pay. A</p>
<p>fellow trains as fine as silk--till he&#x27;s all silk, his skin,</p>
<p>everything, and he&#x27;s fit to live for a hundred years; an&#x27; then he</p>
<p>climbs through the ropes for a hard twenty rounds with some tough</p>
<p>customer that&#x27;s just as good as he is, and in those twenty rounds</p>
<p>he frazzles out all his silk an&#x27; blows in a year of his life.</p>
<p>Yes, sometimes he blows in five years of it, or cuts it in half,</p>
<p>or uses up all of it. I&#x27;ve watched &#x27;em. I&#x27;ve seen fellows strong</p>
<p>as bulls fight a hard battle and die inside the year of</p>
<p>consumption, or kidney disease, or anything else. Now what&#x27;s the</p>
<p>good of it? Money can&#x27;t buy what they throw away. That&#x27;s why I</p>
<p>quit the game and went back to drivin&#x27; team. I got my silk, an&#x27;</p>
<p>I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to keep it, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It must make you feel proud to know you are the master of other</p>
<p>men,&quot; she said softly, aware herself of pride in the strength and</p>
<p>skill of him.</p>
<p>&quot;It does,&quot; he admitted frankly. &quot;I&#x27;m glad I went into the</p>
<p>game--just as glad as I am that I pulled out of it. ... Yep, it&#x27;s</p>
<p>taught me a lot--to keep my eyes open an&#x27; my head cool. Oh, I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>got a temper, a peach of a temper. I get scared of myself</p>
<p>sometimes. I used to be always breakin&#x27; loose. But the fightin&#x27;</p>
<p>taught me to keep down the steam an&#x27; not do things I&#x27;d be sorry</p>
<p>for afterward.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you&#x27;re the sweetest, easiest tempered man I know,&quot; she</p>
<p>interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you believe it. Just watch me, and sometime you&#x27;ll see me</p>
<p>break out that bad that I won&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doin&#x27; myself. Oh,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m a holy terror when I get started!&quot;</p>
<p>This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little</p>
<p>joy-thrill.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, as they neared her neighborhood, &quot;what are you</p>
<p>doin&#x27; next Sunday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing. No plans at all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, suppose you an&#x27; me go buggy-riding all day out in the</p>
<p>hills?&quot;</p>
<p>She did not answer immediately, and for the moment she was seeing</p>
<p>the nightmare vision of her last buggy-ride; of her fear and her</p>
<p>leap from the buggy; and of the long miles and the stumbling</p>
<p>through the darkness in thin-soled shoes that bruised her feet on</p>
<p>every rock. And then it came to her with a great swell of joy</p>
<p>that this man beside her was not such a man.</p>
<p>&quot;I love horses,&quot; she said. &quot;I almost love them better than I do</p>
<p>dancing, only I don&#x27;t know anything about them. My father rode a</p>
<p>great roan war-horse. He was a captain of cavalry, you know. I</p>
<p>never saw him, but somehow I always can see him on that big</p>
<p>horse, with a sash around his waist and his sword at his side. My</p>
<p>brother George has the sword now, but Tom--he&#x27;s the brother I</p>
<p>live with says it is mine because it wasn&#x27;t his father&#x27;s. You</p>
<p>see, they&#x27;re only my half-brothers. I was the only child by my</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s second marriage. That was her real marriage--her</p>
<p>love-marriage, I mean.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon ceased abruptly, embarrassed by her own garrulity; and yet</p>
<p>the impulse was strong to tell this young man all about herself,</p>
<p>and it seemed to her that these far memories were a large part of</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on an&#x27; tell me about it,&quot; Billy urged. &quot;I like to hear about</p>
<p>the old people of the old days. My people was along in there,</p>
<p>too, an&#x27; somehow I think it was a better world to live in than</p>
<p>now. Things was more sensible and natural. I don&#x27;t exactly say</p>
<p>what I mean. But it&#x27;s like this: I don&#x27;t understand life to-day.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s the labor unions an&#x27; employers&#x27; associations, an&#x27;</p>
<p>strikes&#x27;, an&#x27; hard times, an&#x27; huntin&#x27; for jobs, an&#x27; all the rest.</p>
<p>Things wasn&#x27;t like that in the old days. Everybody farmed, an&#x27;</p>
<p>shot their meat, an&#x27; got enough to eat, an&#x27; took care of their</p>
<p>old foiks. But now it&#x27;s all a mix-up that I can&#x27;t understand.</p>
<p>Mebbe I&#x27;m a fool, I don&#x27;t know. But, anyway, go ahead an&#x27; tell us</p>
<p>about your mother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you see, when she was only a young woman she and Captain</p>
<p>Brown fell in love. He was a soldier then, before the war. And he</p>
<p>was ordered East for the war when she was away nursing her sister</p>
<p>Laura. And then came the news that he was killed at Shiloh. And</p>
<p>she married a man who had loved her for years and years. He was a</p>
<p>boy in the same wagon-train coming across the plains. She liked</p>
<p>him, but she didn&#x27;t love him. And afterwerd came the news that my</p>
<p>father wasn&#x27;t killed after all. So it made her very sad, but it</p>
<p>did not spoil her life. She was a good mother end a good wife and</p>
<p>all that, but she was always sad, and sweet, and gentle, and I</p>
<p>think her voice was the most beautiful in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She was game, all right,&quot; Billy approved.</p>
<p>&quot;And my father never married. He loved her all the time. I&#x27;ve got</p>
<p>a lovely poem home that she wrote to him, It&#x27;s just wonderful,</p>
<p>and it sings like music. Well, long, long afterward her husband</p>
<p>died, and then she and my father made their love marriage. They</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t get married until 1882, and she was pretty well along.&quot;</p>
<p>More she told him, as they stood hy the gate, and Saxon tried to</p>
<p>think that the good-bye kiss was a trifle longer than just</p>
<p>ordinary,</p>
<p>&quot;How about nine o&#x27;clock?&quot; he queried across the gate. &quot;Don&#x27;t</p>
<p>bother about lunch or anything. I&#x27;ll fix all that up. You just be</p>
<p>ready at nine.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>Sunday morning Saxon was beforehand in getting ready, and on her</p>
<p>return to the kitchen from her second journey to peep through the</p>
<p>front windows, Sarah began her customary attack.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a shame an&#x27; a disgrace the way some people can afford silk</p>
<p>stockings,&quot; she began. &quot;Look at me, a-toilin&#x27; and a-stewin&#x27; day</p>
<p>an&#x27; night, and I never get silk stockings--nor shoes, three pairs</p>
<p>of them all at one time. But there&#x27;s a just God in heaven, and</p>
<p>there&#x27;ll be some mighty big surprises for some when the end comes</p>
<p>and folks get passed out what&#x27;s comin&#x27; to them.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom, smoking his pipe and cuddling his youngest-born on his</p>
<p>knees, dropped an eyelid surreptitiously on his cheek in token</p>
<p>that Sarah was in a tantrum. Saxon devoted herself to tying a</p>
<p>ribbon in the hair of one of the little girls. Sarah lumbered</p>
<p>heavily about the kitchen, washing and putting away the breakfast</p>
<p>dishes. She straightened her back from the sink with a groan and</p>
<p>glared at Saxon with fresh hostility.</p>
<p>&quot;You ain&#x27;t sayin&#x27; anything, eh? An&#x27; why don&#x27;t you? Because I</p>
<p>guess you still got some natural shame in you a-runnin&#x27; with a</p>
<p>prizefighter. Oh, I&#x27;ve heard about your goings-on with Bill</p>
<p>Roberts. A nice specimen he is. But just you wait till Charley</p>
<p>Long gets his hands on him, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Tom intervened. &quot;Bill Roberts is a pretty</p>
<p>good boy from what I hear.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon smiled with superior knowledge, and Sarah, catching her,</p>
<p>was infuriated.</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#x27;t you marry Charley Long? He&#x27;s crazy for you, and he</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t a drinkin&#x27; man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess he gets outside his share of beer,&quot; Saxon retorted.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; her brother supplemented. &quot;An&#x27; I know for a fact</p>
<p>that he keeps a keg in the house all the time as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you&#x27;ve been guzzling from it,&quot; Sarah snapped.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I have,&quot; Tom said, wiping his mouth reminiscently with the</p>
<p>back of his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, he can afford to keep a keg in the house if he wants to,&quot;</p>
<p>she returned to the attack, which now was directed at her husband</p>
<p>as well. &quot;He pays his bills, and he certainly makes good</p>
<p>money--better than most men, anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; he hasn&#x27;t a wife an&#x27; children to watch out for,&quot; Tom said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor everlastin&#x27; dues to unions that don&#x27;t do him no good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes, he has,&quot; Tom urged genially. &quot;Blamed little he&#x27;d work</p>
<p>in that shop, or any other shop in Oakland, if he didn&#x27;t keep in</p>
<p>good standing with the Blacksmiths. You don&#x27;t understand labor</p>
<p>conditions, Sarah. The unions have got to stick, if the men</p>
<p>aren&#x27;t to starve to death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, of course not,&quot; Sarah sniffed. &quot;I don&#x27;t understand anything.</p>
<p>I ain&#x27;t got a mind. I&#x27;m a fool, an&#x27; you tell me so right before</p>
<p>the children.&quot; She turned savagely on her eldest, who startled</p>
<p>and shrank away. &quot;Willie, your mother is a fool. Do you get that?</p>
<p>Your father says she&#x27;s a fool--says it right before her face and</p>
<p>yourn. She&#x27;s just a plain fool. Next he&#x27;ll be sayin&#x27; she&#x27;s crazy</p>
<p>an&#x27; puttin&#x27; her away in the asylum. An&#x27; how will you like that,</p>
<p>Willie? How will you like to see your mother in a straitjacket</p>
<p>an&#x27; a padded cell, shut out from the light of the sun an&#x27; beaten</p>
<p>like a nigger before the war, Willie, beaten an&#x27; clubbed like a</p>
<p>regular black nigger? That&#x27;s the kind of a father you&#x27;ve got,</p>
<p>Willie. Think of it, Willie, in a padded cell, the mother that</p>
<p>bore you, with the lunatics sereechin&#x27; an&#x27; screamin&#x27; all around,</p>
<p>an&#x27; the quick-lime eatin&#x27; into the dead bodies of them that&#x27;s</p>
<p>beaten to death by the cruel wardens--&quot;</p>
<p>She continued tirelessly, painting with pessimistic strokes the</p>
<p>growing black future her husband was meditating for her, while</p>
<p>the boy, fearful of some vague, incomprehensible catastrophe,</p>
<p>began to weep silently, with a pendulous, trembling underlip.</p>
<p>Saxon, for the moment, lost control of herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, for heaven&#x27;s sake, can&#x27;t we be together five minutes without</p>
<p>quarreling?&quot; she blazed.</p>
<p>Sarah broke off from asylum conjurations and turned upon her</p>
<p>sister-in-law.</p>
<p>&quot;Who&#x27;s quarreling? Can&#x27;t I open my head without bein&#x27; jumped on</p>
<p>by the two of you?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shrugged her shoulders despairingly, and Sarah swung about</p>
<p>on her husband.</p>
<p>&quot;Seein&#x27; you love your sister so much better than your wife, wby</p>
<p>did you want to marry me, that&#x27;s borne your children for you, an&#x27;</p>
<p>slaved for you, an&#x27; toiled for you, an&#x27; worked her fingernails</p>
<p>off for you, with no thanks, an &#x27;insultin&#x27; me before the</p>
<p>children, an&#x27; sayin&#x27; I&#x27;m crazy to their faces. An&#x27; what have you</p>
<p>ever did for me? That&#x27;s what I want to know--me, that&#x27;s cooked</p>
<p>for you, an&#x27; washed your stinkin&#x27; clothes, and fixed your socks,</p>
<p>an&#x27; sat up nights with your brats when they was ailin&#x27;. Look at</p>
<p>that!&quot;</p>
<p>She thrust out a shapeless, swollen foot, encased in a monstrous,</p>
<p>untended shoe, the dry, raw leather of which showed white on the</p>
<p>edges of bulging cracks.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at that! That&#x27;s what I say. Look at that!&quot; Her voice was</p>
<p>persistently rising and at the same time growing throaty. &quot;The</p>
<p>only shoes I got. Me. Your wife. Ain&#x27;t you ashamed? Where are my</p>
<p>three pairs? Look at that stockin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>Speech failed her, and she sat down suddenly on a chair at the</p>
<p>table, glaring unutterable malevolence and misery. She arose with</p>
<p>the abrupt stiffness of an automaton, poured herself a cup of</p>
<p>cold coffee, and in the same jerky way sat down again. As if too</p>
<p>hot for her lips, she filled her saucer with the greasy-looking,</p>
<p>nondescript fluid, and continued her set glare, her breast rising</p>
<p>and falling with staccato, mechanical movement.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Sarah, be c&#x27;am, be c&#x27;am,&quot; Tom pleaded anxiously.</p>
<p>In response, slowly, with utmost deliberation, as if the destiny</p>
<p>of empires rested on the certitude of her act, she turned the</p>
<p>saucer of coffee upside down on the table. She lifted her right</p>
<p>hand, slowly, hugely, and in the same slow, huge way landed the</p>
<p>open palm with a sounding slap on Tom&#x27;s astounded cheek.</p>
<p>Immediately thereafter she raised her voice in the shrill,</p>
<p>hoarse, monotonous madness of hysteria, sat down on the floor,</p>
<p>and rocked back and forth in the throes of an abysmal grief.</p>
<p>Willie&#x27;s silent weeping turned to noise, and the two little</p>
<p>girls, with the fresh ribbons in their hair, joined him. Tom&#x27;s</p>
<p>face was drawn and white, though the smitten cheek still blazed,</p>
<p>and Saxon wanted to put her arms comfortingly around him, yet</p>
<p>dared not. He bent over his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;Sarah, you ain&#x27;t feelin&#x27; well. Let me put you to bed, and I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>finish tidying up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t touch me!--don&#x27;t touch me!&quot; she screamed, jerking</p>
<p>violently away from him.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the children out in the yard, Tom, for a walk,</p>
<p>anything--get them away,&quot; Saxon said. She was sick, and white,</p>
<p>and trembling. &quot;Go, Tom, please, please. There&#x27;s your hat. I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>take care of her. I know just how.&quot;</p>
<p>Left to herself, Saxon worked with frantic haste, assuming the</p>
<p>calm she did not possess, but which she must impart to the</p>
<p>screaming bedlamite upon the floor. The light frame house leaked</p>
<p>the noise hideously, and Saxon knew that the houses on either</p>
<p>side were hearing, and the street itself and the houses across</p>
<p>the street. Her fear was that Billy should arrive in the midst of</p>
<p>it. Further, she was incensed, violated. Every fiber rebelled,</p>
<p>aimost in a nausea; yet she maintained cool control and stroked</p>
<p>Sarah&#x27;s forehead and hair with slow, soothing movements. Soon,</p>
<p>with one arm around her, she managed to win the first diminution</p>
<p>in the strident, atrocious, unceasing scream. A few minutes</p>
<p>later, sobbing heavily, the elder woman lay in bed, across her</p>
<p>forehead and eyes a wet-pack of towel for easement of the</p>
<p>headache she and Saxon tacitly accepted as substitute for the</p>
<p>brain-storm.</p>
<p>When a clatter of hoofs came down the street and stopped, Saxon</p>
<p>was able to slip to the front door and wave her hand to Billy. In</p>
<p>the kitchen she found Tom waiting in sad anxiousness.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right,&quot; she said. &quot;Billy Roberts has come, and I&#x27;ve got</p>
<p>to go. You go in and sit beside her for a while, and maybe she&#x27;ll</p>
<p>go to sleep. But don&#x27;t rush her. Let her have her own way. If</p>
<p>she&#x27;ll let you take her hand, why do it. Try it, anyway. But</p>
<p>first of all, as an opener and just as a matter of course, start</p>
<p>wetting the towel over her eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>He was a kindly, easy-going man; but, after the way of a large</p>
<p>percentage of the Western stock, he was undemonstrative. He</p>
<p>nodded, turned toward the door to obey, and paused irresolutely.</p>
<p>The look he gave back to Saxon was almost dog-like in gratitude</p>
<p>and all-brotherly in love. She felt it, and in spirit leapt</p>
<p>toward it.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right--everything&#x27;s all right,&quot; she cried hastily.</p>
<p>Tom shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;No, it ain&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a shame, a blamed shame, that&#x27;s what it is.&quot;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t care for myself. But it&#x27;s</p>
<p>for you. You got your life before you yet, little kid sister.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll get old, and all that means, fast enough. But it&#x27;s a bad</p>
<p>start for a day off. The thing for you to do is to forget all</p>
<p>this, and skin out with your fellow, an&#x27; have a good time.&quot; In</p>
<p>the open door, his hand on the knob to close it after him, he</p>
<p>halted a second time. A spasm contracted his brow. &quot;Hell! Think</p>
<p>of it! Sarah and I used to go buggy-riding once on a time. And I</p>
<p>guess she had her three pairs of shoes, too. Can you beat it?&quot;</p>
<p>In her bedroom Saxon completed her dressing, for an instant</p>
<p>stepping upon a chair so as to glimpse critically in the small</p>
<p>wall-mirror the hang of her ready-made linen skirt. This, and the</p>
<p>jacket, she had altered to fit, and she had double-stitched the</p>
<p>seams to achieve the coveted tailored effect. Still on the chair,</p>
<p>all in the moment of quick clear-seeing, she drew the skirt</p>
<p>tightly back and raised it. The sight was good to her, nor did</p>
<p>she under-appraise the lines of the slender ankle above the low</p>
<p>tan tie nor did she under-appraise the delicate yet mature swell</p>
<p>of calf outlined in the fresh brown of a new cotton stocking.</p>
<p>Down from the chair, she pinned on a firm sailor hat of white</p>
<p>straw with a brown ribbon around the crown that matched her</p>
<p>ribbon belt. She rubbed her cheeks quickly and fiercely to bring</p>
<p>back the color Sarah had driven out of them, and delayed a moment</p>
<p>longer to put on her tan lisle-thread gloves. Once, in the</p>
<p>fashion-page of a Sunday supplement, she had read that no lady</p>
<p>ever put on her gloves after she left the door.</p>
<p>With a resolute self-grip, as she crossed the parlor and passed</p>
<p>the door to Sarah&#x27;s bedroom, through the thin wood of which came</p>
<p>elephantine moanings and low slubberings, she steeled herself to</p>
<p>keep the color in her cheeks and the brightness in her eyes. And</p>
<p>so well did she succeed that Billy never dreamed that the</p>
<p>radiant, live young thing, tripping lightly down the steps to</p>
<p>him, had just come from a bout with soul-sickening hysteria and</p>
<p>madness.</p>
<p>To her, in the bright sun, Billy&#x27;s blondness was startling. His</p>
<p>cheeks, smooth as a girl&#x27;s, were touched with color. The blue</p>
<p>eyes seemed more cloudily blue than usual, and the crisp, sandy</p>
<p>hair hinted more than ever of the pale straw-gold that was not</p>
<p>there. Never had she seen him quite so royally young. As he</p>
<p>smiled to greet her, with a slow white flash of teeth from</p>
<p>between red lips, she caught again the promise of easement and</p>
<p>rest. Fresh from the shattering chaos of her sister-in-law&#x27;s</p>
<p>mind, Billy&#x27;s tremendous calm was especially satisfying, and</p>
<p>Saxon mentally laughed to scorn the terrible temper he had</p>
<p>charged to himself.</p>
<p>She had been buggy-riding before, but always behind one horse,</p>
<p>jaded, and livery, in a top-buggy, heavy and dingy, such as</p>
<p>livery stables rent because of sturdy unbreakableness. But here</p>
<p>stood two horses, head-tossing and restless, shouting in every</p>
<p>high-light glint of their satin, golden-sorrel coats that they</p>
<p>had never been rented out in all their glorious young lives.</p>
<p>Between them was a pole inconceivably slender, on them were</p>
<p>harnesses preposterously string-like and fragile. And Billy</p>
<p>belonged here, by elemental right, a part of them and of it, a</p>
<p>master-part and a component, along with the spidery-delicate,</p>
<p>narrow-boxed, wide- and yellow-wheeled, rubber-tired rig,</p>
<p>efficient and capable, as different as he was different from the</p>
<p>other man who had taken her out behind stolid, lumubering horses.</p>
<p>He held the reins in one hand, yet, with low, steady voice,</p>
<p>confident and assuring, held the nervous young animals more by</p>
<p>the will and the spirit of him.</p>
<p>It was no time for lingering. With the quick glance and</p>
<p>fore-knowledge of a woman, Saxon saw, not merely the curious</p>
<p>children clustering about, but the peering of adult faces from</p>
<p>open doors and windows, and past window-shades lifted up or held</p>
<p>aside. With his free hand, Billy drew back the linen robe and</p>
<p>helped her to a place beside him. The high-backed, luxuriously</p>
<p>upholstered seat of brown leather gave her a sense of great</p>
<p>comfort; yet even greater, it seemed to her, was the nearness and</p>
<p>comfort of the man himself and of his body.</p>
<p>&quot;How d&#x27;ye like &#x27;em?&quot; he asked, changing the reins to both hands</p>
<p>and chirruping the horses, which went out with a jerk in an</p>
<p>immediacy of action that was new to her. &quot;They&#x27;re the boss&#x27;s, you</p>
<p>know. Couldn&#x27;t rent animals like them. He lets me take them out</p>
<p>for exercise sometimes. If they ain&#x27;t exercised regular they&#x27;re a</p>
<p>handful.--Look at King, there, prancin&#x27;. Some style, eh? Some</p>
<p>style! The other one&#x27;s the real goods, though. Prince is his</p>
<p>name. Got to have some bit on him to hold&#x27;m.--Ah! Would you?--Did</p>
<p>you see&#x27;m, Saxon? Some horse! Some horse!&quot;</p>
<p>From behind came the admiring cheer of the neighborhood children,</p>
<p>and Saxon, with a sigh of content, knew that the happy day had at</p>
<p>last begun.</p>
<p>CHAPTER X</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know horses,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;I&#x27;ve never been on one&#x27;s</p>
<p>back, and the only ones I&#x27;ve tried to drive were single, and</p>
<p>lame, or almost falling down, or something. But I&#x27;m not afraid of</p>
<p>horses. I just love them. I was born loving them, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy threw an admiring, appreciative glance at her.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the stuff. That&#x27;s what I like in a woman--grit. Some of</p>
<p>the girls I&#x27;ve had out--well, take it from me, they made me sick.</p>
<p>Oh, I&#x27;m hep to &#x27;em. Nervous, an&#x27; trembly, an&#x27; screechy, an&#x27;</p>
<p>wabbly. I reckon they come out on my account an&#x27; not for the</p>
<p>ponies. But me for the brave kid that likes the ponies. You&#x27;re</p>
<p>the real goods, Saxon, honest to God you are. Why, I can talk</p>
<p>like a streak with you. The rest of &#x27;em make me sick. I&#x27;m like a</p>
<p>clam. They don&#x27;t know nothin&#x27;, an&#x27; they&#x27;re that scared all the</p>
<p>time--well, I guess you get me&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have to be born to love horses, maybe,&quot; she answered. &quot;Maybe</p>
<p>it&#x27;s because I always think of my father on his roan war-horse</p>
<p>that makes me love horses. But, anyway, I do. When I was a little</p>
<p>girl I was drawing horses all the time. My mother always</p>
<p>encouraged me. I&#x27;ve a scrapbook mostly filled with horses I drew</p>
<p>when I was little. Do you know, Billy, sometimes I dream I</p>
<p>actually own a horse, all my own. And lots of times I dream I&#x27;m</p>
<p>on a horse&#x27;s back, or driving him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll let you drive &#x27;em, after a while, when they&#x27;ve worked their</p>
<p>edge off. They&#x27;re pullin&#x27; now.--There, put your hands in front of</p>
<p>mine--take hold tight. Feel that? Sure you feel it. An&#x27; you ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>feelin&#x27; it all by a long shot. I don&#x27;t dast slack, you bein&#x27; such</p>
<p>a lightweight.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled as she felt the apportioned pull of the mouths</p>
<p>of the beautiful, live things; and he, looking at her, sparkled</p>
<p>with her in her delight.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the good of a woman if she can&#x27;t keep up with a man?&quot; he</p>
<p>broke out enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&quot;People that like the same things always get along best</p>
<p>together,&quot; she answered, with a triteness that concealed the joy</p>
<p>that was hers at being so spontaneously in touch with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Saxon, I&#x27;ve fought battles, good ones, frazzlin&#x27; my silk</p>
<p>away to beat the band before whisky-soaked, smokin&#x27; audiences of</p>
<p>rotten fight-fans, that just made me sick clean through. An&#x27;</p>
<p>them, that couldn&#x27;t take just one stiff jolt or hook to jaw or</p>
<p>stomach, a-cheerin&#x27; me an&#x27; yellin&#x27; for blood. Blood, mind you!</p>
<p>An&#x27; them without the blood of a shrimp in their bodies. Why,</p>
<p>honest, now, I&#x27;d sooner fight before an audience of one--you for</p>
<p>instance, or anybody I liked. It&#x27;d do me proud. But them</p>
<p>sickenin&#x27;, sap-headed stiffs, with the grit of rabbits and the</p>
<p>silk of mangy ky-yi&#x27;s, a-cheerin&#x27; me--ME! Can you blame me for</p>
<p>quittin&#x27;the dirty game?--Why, I&#x27;d sooner fight before broke-down</p>
<p>old plugs of work-horses that&#x27;s candidates for chicken-meat, than</p>
<p>before them rotten bunches of stiffs with nothin&#x27; thicker&#x27;n water</p>
<p>in their veins, an&#x27; Contra Costa water at that when the rains is</p>
<p>heavy on the hills.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I...I didn&#x27;t know prizefighting was like that,&quot; she faltered, as</p>
<p>she released her hold on the lines and sank back again beside</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>&quot;It ain&#x27;t the fightin&#x27;, it&#x27;s the fight-crowds,&quot; he defended with</p>
<p>instant jealousy. &quot;Of course, fightin&#x27; hurts a young fellow</p>
<p>because it frazzles the silk outa him an&#x27; all that. But it&#x27;s the</p>
<p>low-lifers in the audience that gets me. Why the good things they</p>
<p>say to me, the praise an&#x27; that, is insuiting. Do you get me? It</p>
<p>makes me cheap. Think of it--booze-guzzlin&#x27; stiffs that &#x27;d be</p>
<p>afraid to mix it with a sick cat, not fit to hold the coat of any</p>
<p>decent man, think of them a-standin&#x27; up on their hind legs an&#x27;</p>
<p>yellin&#x27; an&#x27; cheerin&#x27; me--ME!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! ha! What d&#x27;ye think of that? Ain&#x27;t he a rogue?&quot;</p>
<p>A big bulldog, sliding obliquely and silently across the street,</p>
<p>unconcerned with the team he was avoiding, had passed so close</p>
<p>that Prince, baring his teeth like a stallion, plunged his head</p>
<p>down against reins and check in an effort to seize the dog.</p>
<p>&quot;Now he&#x27;s some fighter, that Prince. An&#x27; he&#x27;s natural. He didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>make that reach just for some low-lifer to yell&#x27;m on. He just</p>
<p>done it outa pure cussedness and himself. That&#x27;s clean. That&#x27;s</p>
<p>right. Because it&#x27;s natural. But them fight-fans! Honest to God,</p>
<p>Saxon...&quot;</p>
<p>And Saxon, glimpsing him sidewise, as he watched the horses and</p>
<p>their way on the Sunday morning streets, checking them back</p>
<p>suddenly and swerving to avoid two boys coasting across street on</p>
<p>a toy wagon, saw in him deeps and intensities, all the magic</p>
<p>connotations of temperament, the glimmer and hint of rages</p>
<p>profound, bleaknesses as cold and far as the stars, savagery as</p>
<p>keen as a wolf&#x27;s and clean as a stallion&#x27;s, wrath as implacable</p>
<p>as a destroying angel&#x27;s, and youth that was fire and life beyond</p>
<p>time and place. She was awed and fascinated, with the hunger of</p>
<p>woman bridging the vastness to him, daring to love him with arms</p>
<p>and breast that ached to him, murmuring to herself and through</p>
<p>all the halls of her soul, &quot;You dear, you dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Honest to God, Saxon,&quot; he took up the broken thread, &quot;they&#x27;s</p>
<p>times when I&#x27;ve hated them, when I wanted to jump over the ropes</p>
<p>and wade into them, knock-down and drag-out, an&#x27; show&#x27;m what</p>
<p>fightin&#x27; was. Take that night with Billy Murphy. Billy</p>
<p>Murphy!--if you only knew him. My friend. As clean an&#x27; game a boy</p>
<p>as ever jumped inside the ropes to take the decision. Him! We</p>
<p>went to the Durant School together. We grew up chums. His fight</p>
<p>was my fight. My trouble was his trouble. We both took to the</p>
<p>fightin&#x27; game. They matched us. Not the first time. Twice we&#x27;d</p>
<p>fought draws. Once the decision was his; once it was mine. The</p>
<p>fifth fight of two lovin&#x27; men that just loved each other. He&#x27;s</p>
<p>three years older&#x27;n me. He&#x27;s a wife and two or three kids, an&#x27; I</p>
<p>know them, too. And he&#x27;s my friend. Get it?</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m ten pounds heavier--but with heavyweights that &#x27;a all right.</p>
<p>He can&#x27;t time an&#x27; distance as good as me, an&#x27; I can keep set</p>
<p>better, too. But he&#x27;s cleverer an&#x27; quicker. I never was quick</p>
<p>like him. We both can take punishment, an&#x27; we&#x27;re both two-handed,</p>
<p>a wallop in all our fists. I know the kick of his, an&#x27; he knows</p>
<p>my kick, an&#x27; we&#x27;re both real respectful. And we&#x27;re even-matched.</p>
<p>Two draws, and a decision to each. Honest, I ain&#x27;t any kind of a</p>
<p>hunch who&#x27;s gain&#x27; to win, we&#x27;re that even.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, the fight.--You ain&#x27;t squeamish, are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; she cried. &quot;I&#x27;d just love to hear--you are so</p>
<p>wonderful.&quot;</p>
<p>He took the praise with a clear, unwavering look, and without</p>
<p>hint of acknowledgment.</p>
<p>&quot;We go along--six rounds--seven rounds--eight rounds; an&#x27; honors</p>
<p>even. I&#x27;ve been timin&#x27; his rushes an&#x27; straight-leftin&#x27; him, an&#x27;</p>
<p>meetin&#x27; his duck with a wicked little right upper-cut, an&#x27; he&#x27;s</p>
<p>shaken me on the jaw an&#x27; walloped my ears till my head&#x27;s all</p>
<p>singin&#x27; an&#x27; buzzin&#x27;. An&#x27; everything lovely with both of us, with</p>
<p>a noise like a draw decision in sight. Twenty rounds is the</p>
<p>distance, you know.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; then his bad luck comes. We&#x27;re just mixin&#x27; into a clinch</p>
<p>that ain&#x27;t arrived yet, when he shoots a short hook to my</p>
<p>head--his left, an&#x27; a real hay-maker if it reaches my jaw. I make</p>
<p>a forward duck, not quick enough, an&#x27; he lands bingo on the side</p>
<p>of my head. Honest to God, Saxon, it&#x27;s that heavy I see some</p>
<p>stars. But it don&#x27;t hurt an&#x27; ain&#x27;t serious, that high up where</p>
<p>the bone&#x27;s thick. An&#x27; right there he finishes himself, for his</p>
<p>bad thumb, which I&#x27;ve known since he first got it as a kid</p>
<p>fightin&#x27; in the sandlot at Watts Tract--he smashes that thumb</p>
<p>right there, on my hard head, back into the socket with an</p>
<p>out-twist, an&#x27; all the old cords that&#x27;d never got strong gets</p>
<p>theirs again. I didn&#x27;t mean it. A dirty trick, fair in the game,</p>
<p>though, to make a guy smash his hand on your head. But not</p>
<p>between friends. I couldn&#x27;t a-done that to Bill Murphy for a</p>
<p>million dollars. It was a accident, just because I was slow,</p>
<p>because I was born slow.</p>
<p>&quot;The hurt of it! Honest, Saxon, you don&#x27;t know what hurt is till</p>
<p>you&#x27;ve got a old hurt like that hurt again. What can Billy Murphy</p>
<p>do but slow down? He&#x27;s got to. He ain&#x27;t fightin&#x27; two-handed any</p>
<p>more. He knows it; I know it; The referee knows it; but nobody</p>
<p>else. He goes on a-moving that left of his like it&#x27;s all right.</p>
<p>But it ain&#x27;t. It&#x27;s hurtin&#x27; him like a knife dug into him. He</p>
<p>don&#x27;t dast strike a real blow with that left of his. But it</p>
<p>hurts, anyway. Just to move it or not move it hurts, an&#x27; every</p>
<p>little dab-feint that I&#x27;m too wise to guard, knowin&#x27; there&#x27;s no</p>
<p>weight behind, why them little dab-touches on that poor thumb</p>
<p>goes right to the heart of him, an&#x27; hurts worse than a thousand</p>
<p>boils or a thousand knockouts--just hurts all over again, an&#x27;</p>
<p>worse, each time an&#x27; touch.</p>
<p>&quot;Now suppose he an&#x27; me was boxin&#x27; for fun, out in the back yard,</p>
<p>an&#x27; he hurts his thumb that way, why we&#x27;d have the gloves off in</p>
<p>a jiffy an&#x27; I&#x27;d be putting cold compresses on that poor thumb of</p>
<p>his an&#x27; bandagin&#x27; it that tight to keep the inflammation down.</p>
<p>But no. This is a fight for fight-fans that&#x27;s paid their</p>
<p>admission for blood, an&#x27; blood they&#x27;re goin&#x27; to get. They ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>men. They&#x27;re wolves.</p>
<p>&quot;He has to go easy, now, an&#x27; I ain&#x27;t a-forcin&#x27; him none. I&#x27;m all</p>
<p>shot to pieces. I don&#x27;t know what to do. So I slow down, an&#x27; the</p>
<p>fans get hep to it. &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you fight?&#x27; they begin to yell;</p>
<p>&#x27;Fake! Fake!&#x27; &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you kiss&#x27;m?&#x27; &#x27;Lovin&#x27; cup for yours, Bill</p>
<p>Roberts!&#x27; an&#x27; that sort of bunk.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Fight!&#x27; says The referee to me, low an&#x27; savage. &#x27;Fight, or I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>disqualify you--you, Bill, I mean you.&#x27; An&#x27; this to me, with a</p>
<p>touch on the shoulder &#x27;so they&#x27;s no mistakin&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;It ain&#x27;t pretty. It ain&#x27;t right. D&#x27;ye know what we was fightin&#x27;</p>
<p>for? A hundred bucks. Think of it! An&#x27; the game is we got to do</p>
<p>our best to put our man down for the count because of the fans</p>
<p>has bet on us. Sweet, ain&#x27;t it? Well, that&#x27;s my last fight. It</p>
<p>finishes me deado. Never again for yours truly.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Quit,&#x27; I says to Billy Murphy in a clinch; &#x27;for the love of</p>
<p>God, Bill, quit.&#x27; An&#x27; he says back, in a whisper, &#x27;I can&#x27;t,</p>
<p>Bill--you know that.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; then the referee drags us apart, an&#x27; a lot of the fans</p>
<p>begins to hoot an&#x27; boo.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Now kick in, damn you, Bill Roberts, an&#x27; finish&#x27;m&#x27; the referee</p>
<p>says to me, an&#x27; I tell&#x27;m to go to hell as Bill an&#x27; me flop into</p>
<p>the next clinch, not hittin&#x27;, an&#x27; Bill touches his thumb again,</p>
<p>an&#x27; I see the pain shoot across his face. Game? That good boy&#x27;s</p>
<p>the limit. An&#x27; to look into the eyes of a brave man that&#x27;s sick</p>
<p>with pain, an&#x27; love &#x27;m, an&#x27; see love in them eyes of his, an&#x27;</p>
<p>then have to go on givin&#x27; &#x27;m pain--call that sport? I can&#x27;t see</p>
<p>it. But the crowd&#x27;s got its money on us. We don&#x27;t count. We&#x27;ve</p>
<p>sold ourselves for a hundred bucks, an&#x27; we gotta deliver the</p>
<p>goods.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me tell you, Saxon, honest to God, that was one of the times</p>
<p>I wanted to go through the ropes an&#x27; drop them fans a-yellin&#x27; for</p>
<p>blood an&#x27; show &#x27;em what blood is.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;For God&#x27;s sake finish me, Bill,&#x27; Bill says to me in that</p>
<p>clinch; &#x27;put her over an&#x27; I&#x27;ll fall for it, but I can&#x27;t lay</p>
<p>down.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;D&#x27;ye want to know? I cry there, right in the ring, in that</p>
<p>clinch. The weeps for me. &#x27;I can&#x27;t do it, Bill,&#x27; I whisper back,</p>
<p>hangin&#x27; onto&#x27;m like a brother an&#x27; the referee ragin&#x27; an&#x27; draggin&#x27;</p>
<p>at us to get us apart, an&#x27; all the wolves in the house snarlin&#x27;.</p>
<p>&#x27;You got &#x27;m!&#x27; the audience is yellin&#x27;. &#x27;Go in an&#x27; finish &#x27;m!&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;The hay for him, Bill; put her across to the jaw an&#x27; see &#x27;m</p>
<p>fall!&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You got to, Bill, or you&#x27;re a dog,&#x27; Bill says, lookin&#x27; love at</p>
<p>me in his eyes as the referee&#x27;s grip untangles us clear.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; them wolves of fans yellin&#x27;: &#x27;Fake! Fake! Fake!&#x27; like that,</p>
<p>an&#x27; keepin&#x27; it up.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I done it. They&#x27;s only that way out. I done it. By God, I</p>
<p>done it. I had to. I feint for &#x27;m, draw his left, duck to the</p>
<p>right past it, takin&#x27; it across my shoulder, an come up with my</p>
<p>right to his jaw. An&#x27; he knows the trick. He&#x27;s hep. He&#x27;s beaten</p>
<p>me to it an&#x27; blocked it with his shoulder a thousan&#x27; times. But</p>
<p>this time he don&#x27;t. He keeps himself wide open on purpose. Blim!</p>
<p>It lands. He&#x27;s dead in the air, an&#x27; he goes down sideways,</p>
<p>strikin&#x27; his face first on the rosin-canvas an&#x27; then layin&#x27; dead,</p>
<p>his head twisted under &#x27;m till you&#x27;d a-thought his neck was</p>
<p>broke. ME--I did that for a hundred bucks an&#x27; a bunch of stiffs</p>
<p>I&#x27;d be ashamed to wipe my feet on. An&#x27; then I pick Bill up in my</p>
<p>arms an&#x27; carry&#x27;m to his corner, an&#x27; help bring&#x27;m around. Well,</p>
<p>they ain&#x27;t no kick comin&#x27;. They pay their money an&#x27; they get</p>
<p>their blood, an&#x27; a knockout. An&#x27; a better man than them, that I</p>
<p>love, layin&#x27; there dead to the world with a skinned face on the</p>
<p>mat.&quot;</p>
<p>For a moment he was still, gazing straight before him at the</p>
<p>horses, his face hard and angry. He sighed, looked at Saxon, and</p>
<p>smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I quit the game right there. An&#x27; Billy Murphy&#x27;s laughed at</p>
<p>me for it. He still follows it. A side-line, you know, because he</p>
<p>works at a good trade. But once in a while, when the house needs</p>
<p>paintin&#x27;, or the doctor bills are up, or his oldest kid wants a</p>
<p>bicycle, he jumps out an&#x27; makes fifty or a hundred bucks before</p>
<p>some of the clubs. I want you to meet him when it comes handy.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s some boy I&#x27;m tellin&#x27; you. But it did make me sick that</p>
<p>night.&quot;</p>
<p>Again the harshness and anger were in his face, and Saxon amazed</p>
<p>herself by doing unconsciously what women higher in the social</p>
<p>scale have done with deliberate sincerity. Her hand went out</p>
<p>impulsively to his holding the lines, resting on top of it for a</p>
<p>moment with quick, firm pressure. Her reward was a smile from</p>
<p>lips and eyes, as his face turned toward her.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I never talk a streak like this to anybody.</p>
<p>I just hold my hush an&#x27; keep my thinks to myself. But, somehow, I</p>
<p>guess it&#x27;s funny, I kind of have a feelin&#x27; I want to make good</p>
<p>with you. An&#x27; that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m tellin&#x27; you my thinks. Anybody can</p>
<p>dance.&quot;</p>
<p>The way led uptown, past the City Hall and the Fourteenth Street</p>
<p>skyscrapers, and out Broadway to Mountain View. Turning to the</p>
<p>right at the cemetery, they climbed the Piedmont Heights to Blair</p>
<p>Park and plunged into the green coolness of Jack Hayes Canyon.</p>
<p>Saxon could not suppress her surprise and joy at the quickness</p>
<p>with which they covered the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;They are beautiful,&quot; she said. &quot;I never dreamed I&#x27;d ever ride</p>
<p>behind horses like them. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll wake up now and find</p>
<p>it&#x27;s a dream. You know, I dream horses all the time. I&#x27;d give</p>
<p>anything to own one some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s funny, ain&#x27;t it?&quot; Billy answered. &quot;I like horses that way.</p>
<p>The boss says I&#x27;m a wooz at horses. An&#x27; I know he&#x27;s a dub. He</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know the first thing. An&#x27; yet he owns two hundred big heavy</p>
<p>draughts besides this light drivin&#x27; pair, an&#x27; I don&#x27;t own one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet God makes the horses,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a sure thing the boss don&#x27;t. Then how does he have so</p>
<p>many?--two hundred of &#x27;em, I&#x27;m tellin&#x27; you. He thinks he likes</p>
<p>horses. Honest to God, Saxon, he don&#x27;t like all his horses as</p>
<p>much as I like the last hair on the last tail of the scrubbiest</p>
<p>of the bunch. Yet they&#x27;re his. Wouldn&#x27;t it jar you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it?&quot; Saxon laughed appreciatively. &quot;I just love fancy</p>
<p>shirtwaists, an&#x27; I spent my life ironing some of the</p>
<p>beautifullest I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s funny, an&#x27; it isn&#x27;t fair.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy gritted his teeth in another of his rages.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; the way some of them women gets their shirtwaists. It makes</p>
<p>me sick, thinkin&#x27; of you ironin&#x27; &#x27;em. You know what I mean,</p>
<p>Saxon. They ain&#x27;t no use wastin&#x27; words over it. You know. I know.</p>
<p>Everybody knows. An&#x27; it&#x27;s a hell of a world if men an&#x27; women</p>
<p>sometimes can&#x27;t talk to each other about such things.&quot; His manner</p>
<p>was almost apologetic yet it was defiantly and assertively right.</p>
<p>&quot;I never talk this way to other girls. They&#x27;d think I&#x27;m workin up</p>
<p>to designs on &#x27;em. They make me sick the way they&#x27;re always</p>
<p>lookin&#x27; for them designs. But you&#x27;re different I can talk to you</p>
<p>that way. I know I&#x27;ve got to. It&#x27;s the square thing. You&#x27;re like</p>
<p>Billy Murphy, or any other man a man can talk to.&quot;</p>
<p>She sighed with a great happiness, and looked at him with</p>
<p>unconscious, love-shining eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the same way with me,&quot; she said. &quot;The fellows I&#x27;ve run with</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never dared let talk about such things, because I knew</p>
<p>they&#x27;d take advantage of it. Why, all the time, with them, I&#x27;ve a</p>
<p>feeling that we&#x27;re cheating and lying to each other, playing a</p>
<p>game like at a masquerade ball.&quot; She paused for a moment,</p>
<p>hesitant and debating, then went on in a queer low voice. &quot;I</p>
<p>haven&#x27;t been asleep. I&#x27;ve seen... and heard. I&#x27;ve had my chances,</p>
<p>when I was that tired of the laundry I&#x27;d have done almost</p>
<p>anything. I could have got those fancy shirtwaists... an&#x27; all the</p>
<p>rest... and maybe a horse to ride. There was a bank cashier...</p>
<p>married, too, if you please. He talked to me straight out. I</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t count, you know. I wasn&#x27;t a girl, with a girl&#x27;s feelings,</p>
<p>or anything. I was nobody. It was just like a business talk. I</p>
<p>learned about men from him. He told me what he&#x27;d do. He...&quot;</p>
<p>Her voice died away in sadness, and in the silence she could hear</p>
<p>Billy grit his teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t tell me,&quot; he cried. &quot;I know. It&#x27;s a dirty world--an</p>
<p>unfair, lousy world. I can&#x27;t make it out. They&#x27;s no squareness in</p>
<p>it.--Women, with the best that&#x27;s in &#x27;em, bought an&#x27; sold like</p>
<p>horses. I don&#x27;t understand women that way. I don&#x27;t understand men</p>
<p>that way. I can&#x27;t see how a man gets anything but cheated when he</p>
<p>buys such things. It&#x27;s funny, ain&#x27;t it? Take my boss an&#x27; his</p>
<p>horses. He owns women, too. He might a-owned you, just because</p>
<p>he&#x27;s got the price. An&#x27;, Saxon, you was made for fancy</p>
<p>shirtwaists an&#x27; all that, but, honest to God, I can&#x27;t see you</p>
<p>payin&#x27; for them that way. It&#x27;d be a crime--&quot;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly and reined in the horses. Around a sharp</p>
<p>turn, speeding down the grade upon them, had appeared an</p>
<p>automobile. With slamming of brakes it was brought to a stop,</p>
<p>while the faces of the occupants took new lease of interest of</p>
<p>life and stared at the young man and woman in the light rig that</p>
<p>barred the way. Billy held up his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Take the outside, sport,&quot; he said to the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothin&#x27; doin&#x27;, kiddo,&quot; came the answer, as the chauffeur</p>
<p>measured with hard, wise eyes the crumbling edge of the road and</p>
<p>the downfall of the outside bank.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we camp,&quot; Billy announced cheerfully. &quot;I know the rules of</p>
<p>the road. These animals ain&#x27;t automobile broke altogether, an&#x27; if</p>
<p>you think I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to have &#x27;em shy off the grade you got another</p>
<p>guess comin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>A confusion of injured protestation arose from those that sat in</p>
<p>the car.</p>
<p>&quot;You needn&#x27;t be a road-hog because you&#x27;re a Rube,&quot; said the</p>
<p>chauffeur. &quot;We ain&#x27;t a-goin&#x27; to hurt your horses. Pull out so we</p>
<p>can pass. If you don&#x27;t...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;ll do you, sport,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s retort. &quot;You can&#x27;t talk that</p>
<p>way to yours truly. I got your number an&#x27; your tag, my son.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re standin&#x27; on your foot. Back up the grade an&#x27; get off of</p>
<p>it. Stop on the outside at the first psssin&#x27;-place an&#x27; we&#x27;ll pass</p>
<p>you. You&#x27;ve got the juice. Throw on the reverse.&quot;</p>
<p>After a nervous consultation, the chauffeur obeyed, and the car</p>
<p>backed up the hill and out of sight around the turn.</p>
<p>&quot;Them cheap skates,&quot; Billy sneered to Saxon, &quot;with a couple of</p>
<p>gallons of gasoline an&#x27; the price of a machine a-thinkin&#x27; they</p>
<p>own the roads your folks an&#x27; my folks made.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Takln&#x27; all night about it?&quot; came the chauffeur&#x27;s voice from</p>
<p>around the bend. &quot;Get a move on. You can pass.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Get off your foot,&quot; Billy retorted contemptuously. &quot;I&#x27;m a-comin&#x27;</p>
<p>when I&#x27;m ready to come, an&#x27; if you ain&#x27;t given room enough I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>go clean over you an&#x27; your load of chicken meat.&quot;</p>
<p>He slightly slacked the reins on the restless, head-tossing</p>
<p>animals, and without need of chirrup they took the weight of the</p>
<p>light vehicle and passed up the hill and apprehensively on the</p>
<p>inside of the purring machine.</p>
<p>&quot;Where was we?&quot; Billy queried, as the clear road showed in front.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep, take my boss. Why should he own two hundred horses, an&#x27;</p>
<p>women, an&#x27; the rest, an&#x27; you an&#x27; me own nothin&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You own your silk, Billy,&quot; she said softly.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; you yours. Yet we sell it to &#x27;em like it was cloth across</p>
<p>the counter at so much a yard. I guess you&#x27;re hep to what a few</p>
<p>more years in the laundry&#x27;ll do to you. Take me. I&#x27;m sellin&#x27; my</p>
<p>silk slow every day I work. See that little finger?&quot; He shifted</p>
<p>the reins to one hand for a moment and held up the free hand for</p>
<p>inspection. &quot;I can&#x27;t straighten it like the others, an&#x27; it&#x27;s</p>
<p>growin&#x27;. I never put it out fightin&#x27;. The teamin&#x27;s done it.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s silk gone across the counter, that&#x27;s all. Ever see a old</p>
<p>four-horse teamster&#x27;s hands? They look like claws they&#x27;re that</p>
<p>crippled an&#x27; twisted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Things weren&#x27;t like that in the old days when our folks crossed</p>
<p>the plains,&quot; she answered. &quot;They might a-got their fingers</p>
<p>twisted, but they owned the best goin&#x27; in the way of horses and</p>
<p>such.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. They worked for themselves. They twisted their fingers for</p>
<p>themselves. But I&#x27;m twistin&#x27; my fingers for my boss. Why, d&#x27;ye</p>
<p>know, Saxon, his hands is soft as a woman&#x27;s that&#x27;s never done any</p>
<p>work. Yet he owns the horses an&#x27; the stables, an&#x27; never does a</p>
<p>tap of work, an&#x27; I manage to scratch my meal-ticket an&#x27; my</p>
<p>clothes. It&#x27;s got my goat the way things is run. An&#x27; who runs &#x27;em</p>
<p>that way? That&#x27;s what I want to know. Times has changed. Who</p>
<p>changed &#x27;em?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God didn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bet your life he didn&#x27;t, An&#x27; that&#x27;s another thing that gets</p>
<p>me. Who&#x27;s God anyway? If he&#x27;s runnin&#x27; things--an&#x27; what good is he</p>
<p>if he ain&#x27;t?--then why does he let my boss, an&#x27; men like that</p>
<p>cashier you mentioned, why does he let them own the horses, an&#x27;</p>
<p>buy the women, the nice little girls that oughta be lovin&#x27; their</p>
<p>own huabands, an&#x27; havin&#x27; children they&#x27;re not ashamed of, an&#x27;</p>
<p>just bein&#x27; happy aecordin&#x27; to their nature?&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>The horses, resting frequently and lathered by the work, had</p>
<p>climbed the steep grade of the old road to Moraga Valley, and on</p>
<p>the divide of the Contra Costa hills the way descended sharply</p>
<p>through the green and sunny stillness of Redwood Canyon.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, ain&#x27;t it swell?&quot; Billy queried, with a wave of his hand</p>
<p>indicating the circled tree-groups, the trickle of unseen water,</p>
<p>and the summer hum of bees.</p>
<p>&quot;I love it&quot;&#x27; Saxon affirmed. &quot;It makes me want to live in the</p>
<p>country, and I never have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me, too, Saxon. I&#x27;ve never lived in the country in my life--an&#x27;</p>
<p>all my folks was country folks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No cities then. Everybody lived in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you&#x27;re right,&quot; he nodded. &quot;They just had to live in the</p>
<p>country.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no brake on the light carriage, and Billy became</p>
<p>absorbed in managing his team down the steep, winding road. Saxon</p>
<p>leaned back, eyes closed, with a feeling of ineeffable rest. Time</p>
<p>and again he shot glances at her closed eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot; he asked finally, in mild alarm. &quot;You ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>sick?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s so beautiful I&#x27;m afraid to look,&quot; she answered. &quot;It&#x27;s so</p>
<p>brave it hurts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;BRAVE?--now that&#x27;s funnny.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it? But it just makes me feel that way. It&#x27;s brave. Now</p>
<p>the houses and streets and things in the city aren&#x27;t brave. But</p>
<p>this is. I don&#x27;t know why. It just is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By golly, I think you&#x27;re right,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;It strikes me</p>
<p>that way, now you speak of it. They ain&#x27;t no games or tricks</p>
<p>here, no cheatin&#x27; an&#x27; no lyin&#x27;. Them trees just stand up natural</p>
<p>an&#x27; strong an&#x27; clean like young boys their first time in the ring</p>
<p>before they&#x27;ve learned its rottenness an&#x27; how to double-cross an&#x27;</p>
<p>lay down to the bettin&#x27; odds an&#x27; the fightfans. Yep; it is brave.</p>
<p>Say, Saxon, you see things, don&#x27;t you?&quot; His pause was almost</p>
<p>wistful, and he looked at her and studied her with a caressing</p>
<p>softness that ran through her in resurgent thrills. &quot;D&#x27;ye know,</p>
<p>I&#x27;d just like you to see me fight some time--a real fight, with</p>
<p>something doin&#x27; every moment. I&#x27;d be proud to death to do it for</p>
<p>you. An&#x27; I&#x27;d sure fight some with you lookin&#x27; on an&#x27;</p>
<p>understandin&#x27;. That&#x27;d be a fight what is, take it from me. An&#x27;</p>
<p>that&#x27;s funny, too. I never wanted to fight before a woman in my</p>
<p>life. They squeal and screech an&#x27; don&#x27;t understand. But you&#x27;d</p>
<p>understand. It&#x27;s dead open an&#x27; shut you would.&quot;</p>
<p>A little later, swinging along the flat of the valley, through</p>
<p>the little clearings of the farmers and the ripe grain-stretches</p>
<p>golden in the sunshine, Billy turned to Saxon again.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, you&#x27;ve ben in love with fellows, lots of times. Tell me</p>
<p>about it. What&#x27;s it like?&quot;</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;I only thought I was in love--and not many times, either--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Many times!&quot; he cried.</p>
<p>&quot;Not really ever,&quot; she assured him, secretly exultant at his</p>
<p>unconscious jealousy. &quot;I never was really in love. If I had been</p>
<p>I&#x27;d be married now. You see, I couldn&#x27;t see anything else to it</p>
<p>but to marry a man if I loved him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But suppose he didn&#x27;t love you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; she smiled, half with facetiousness and half</p>
<p>with certainty and pride. &quot;I think I could make him love me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you sure could,&quot; Billy proclaimed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&quot;The trouble is,&quot; she went on, &quot;the men that loved me I never</p>
<p>cared for that way.--Oh, look!&quot;</p>
<p>A cottontail rabbit had scuttled across the road, and a tiny dust</p>
<p>cloud lingered like smoke, marking the way of his flight. At the</p>
<p>next turn a dozen quail exploded into the air from under the</p>
<p>noses of the horses. Billy and Saxon exclaimed in mutual delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee,&quot; he muttered, &quot;I almost wisht I&#x27;d ben born a farmer. Folks</p>
<p>wasn&#x27;t made to live in cities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not our kind, at least,&quot; she agreed. Followed a pause and a long</p>
<p>sigh. &quot;It&#x27;s all so beautiful. It would be a dream just to live</p>
<p>all your life in it. I&#x27;d like to be an Indian squaw sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>Several times Billy checked himself on the verge of speech.</p>
<p>&quot;About those fellows you thought you was in love with,&quot; he said</p>
<p>finally. &quot;You ain&#x27;t told me, yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want to know?&quot; she asked. &quot;They didn&#x27;t amount to anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I want to know. Go ahead. Fire away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, first there was Al Stanley--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did he do for a livin&#x27;?&quot; Billy demanded, almost as with</p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>&quot;He wss a gambler.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s face abruptly stiffened, and she could see his eyes</p>
<p>cloudy with doubt in the quick glance he flung at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it was all right,&quot; she laughed. &quot;I was only eight years old.</p>
<p>You see, I&#x27;m beginning at the beginning. It was after my mother</p>
<p>died and when I was adopted by Cady. He kept a hotel and saloon.</p>
<p>It was down in Los Angeles. Just a small hotel. Workingmen, just</p>
<p>common laborers, mostly, and some railroad men, stopped at it,</p>
<p>and I guess Al Stanley got his share of their wages. He was so</p>
<p>handsome and so quiet and soft-spoken. And he had the nicest eyes</p>
<p>and the softest, cleanest hands. I can see them now. He played</p>
<p>with me sometimes, in the afternoon, and gave me candy and little</p>
<p>presents. He used to sleep most of the day. I didn&#x27;t know why,</p>
<p>then. I thought he was a fairy prince in disguise. And then he</p>
<p>got killed, right in the bar-room, but first he killed the man</p>
<p>that killed him. So that was the end of that love affair.</p>
<p>&quot;Next was after the asylum, when I was thirteen and living with</p>
<p>my brother--I&#x27;ve lived with him ever since. He was a boy that</p>
<p>drove a bakery wagon. Almost every morning, on the way to school,</p>
<p>I used to pass him. He would come driving down Wood Street and</p>
<p>turn in on Twelfth. Maybe it was because he drove a horse that</p>
<p>attracted me. Anyway, I must have loved him for a couple of</p>
<p>months. Then he lost his job, or something, for another boy drove</p>
<p>the wagon. And we&#x27;d never even spoken to each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Then there was a bookkeeper when I was sixteen. I seem to run to</p>
<p>bookkeepers. It was a bookkeeper at the laundry that Charley Long</p>
<p>beat up. This other one was when I was working in Hickmeyer&#x27;s</p>
<p>Cannery. He had soft hands, too. But I quickly got all I wanted</p>
<p>of him. He was . . . well, anyway, he had ideas like your boss.</p>
<p>And I never really did love him, truly and honest, Billy. I felt</p>
<p>from the first that he wasn&#x27;t just right. And when I was working</p>
<p>in the paper-box factory I thought I loved a clerk in Kahn&#x27;s</p>
<p>Emporium--you know, on Eleventh and Washington. He was all right.</p>
<p>That was the trouble with him. He was too much all right. He</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t have any life in him, any go. He wanted to marry me,</p>
<p>though. But somehow I couldn&#x27;t see it. That shows I didn&#x27;t love</p>
<p>him. He was narrow-chested and skinny, and his hands were always</p>
<p>cold and fishy. But my! he could dress--just like he came out of</p>
<p>a bandbox. He said he was going to drown himself, and all kinds</p>
<p>of things, but I broke with him just the same.</p>
<p>&quot;And after that...well, there isn&#x27;t any after that. I must have</p>
<p>got particular, I guess, but I didn&#x27;t see anybody I could love.</p>
<p>It seemed more like a game with the men I met, or a fight. And we</p>
<p>never fought fair on either side. Seemed as if we always had</p>
<p>cards up our sleeves. We weren&#x27;t honest or outspoken, but instead</p>
<p>it seemed as if we were trying to take advantage of each other.</p>
<p>Charley Long was honest, though. And so was that bank cashier.</p>
<p>And even they made me have the fight feeling harder than ever.</p>
<p>All of them always made me feel I had to take care of myself.</p>
<p>They wouldn&#x27;t. That was sure.&quot;</p>
<p>She stopped and looked with interest at the clean profile of his</p>
<p>face as he watched and guided the homes. He looked at her</p>
<p>inquiringly, and her eyes laughed lazily into his as she</p>
<p>stretched her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s all,&quot; she concluded. &quot;I&#x27;ve told you everything, which</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never done before to any one. And it&#x27;s your turn now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not much of a turn, Saxon. I&#x27;ve never cared for girls--that is,</p>
<p>not enough to want to marry &#x27;em. I always liked men</p>
<p>better--fellows like Billy Murphy. Besides, I guess I was too</p>
<p>interested in trainin&#x27; an&#x27; fightin&#x27; to bother with women much.</p>
<p>Why, Saxon, honest, while I ain&#x27;t ben altogether good--you</p>
<p>understand what I mean--just the same I ain&#x27;t never talked love</p>
<p>to a girl in my life. They was no call to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The girls have loved you just the same,&quot; she teased, while in</p>
<p>her heart was a curious elation at his virginal confession.</p>
<p>He devoted himself to the horses.</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of them,&quot; she urged.</p>
<p>Still he did not reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, haven&#x27;t they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it wasn&#x27;t my fault,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;If they wanted to</p>
<p>look sideways at me it was up to them. And it was up to me to</p>
<p>sidestep if I wanted to, wasn&#x27;t it? You&#x27;ve no idea, Saxon, how a</p>
<p>prizefighter is run after. Why, sometimes it&#x27;s seemed to me that</p>
<p>girls an&#x27; women ain&#x27;t got an ounce of natural shame in their</p>
<p>make-up. Oh, I was never afraid of them, believe muh, but I</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t hanker after &#x27;em. A man&#x27;s a fool that&#x27;d let them kind get</p>
<p>his goat.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you haven&#x27;t got love in you,&quot; she challenged.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I haven&#x27;t,&quot; was his discouraging reply. &quot;Anyway, I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>see myself lovin&#x27; a girl that runs after me. It&#x27;s all right for</p>
<p>Charley-boys, but a man that is a man don&#x27;t like bein&#x27; chased by</p>
<p>women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother always said that love was the greatest thing in the</p>
<p>world,&quot; Saxon argued. &quot;She wrote poems about it, too. Some of</p>
<p>them were published in the San Jose Mercury.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think about it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; she baffled, meeting his eyes with another</p>
<p>lazy smile. &quot;All I know is it&#x27;s pretty good to be alive a day</p>
<p>like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On a trip like this--you bet it is,&quot; he added promptly.</p>
<p>At one o&#x27;clock Billy turned off the road and drove into an open</p>
<p>space among the trees.</p>
<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s where we eat,&quot; he announced. &quot;I thought it&#x27;d be better to</p>
<p>have a lunch by ourselves than atop at one of these roadside</p>
<p>dinner counters. An&#x27; now, just to make everything safe an&#x27;</p>
<p>comfortable, I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to unharness the horses. We got lots of</p>
<p>time. You can get the lunch basket out an&#x27; spread it on the</p>
<p>lap-robe.&quot;</p>
<p>As Saxon unpacked she basket she was appalled at his</p>
<p>extravagance. She spread an amazing array of ham and chicken</p>
<p>sandwiches, crab salad, hard-boiled eggs, pickled pigs&#x27; feet,</p>
<p>ripe olives and dill pickles, Swiss cheese, salted almonds,</p>
<p>oranges and bananas, and several pint bottles of beer. It was the</p>
<p>quantity as well as the variety that bothered her. It had the</p>
<p>appearance of a reckless attempt to buy out a whole delicatessen</p>
<p>shop.</p>
<p>&quot;You oughtn&#x27;t to blow yourself that way,&quot; she reproved him as he</p>
<p>sat down beside her. &quot;Why it&#x27;s enough for half a dozen</p>
<p>bricklayers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she acknowledged. &quot;But that&#x27;s the trouble. It&#x27;s too much</p>
<p>so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then it&#x27;s all right,&quot; he concluded. &quot;I always believe in havin&#x27;</p>
<p>plenty. Have some beer to wash the dust away before we begin?</p>
<p>Watch out for the glasses. I gotta return them.&quot;</p>
<p>Later, the meal finished, he lay on his back, smoking a</p>
<p>cigarette, and questioned her about her earlier history. She had</p>
<p>been telling him of her life in her brother&#x27;s house, where she</p>
<p>paid four dollars and a half a week board. At fifteen she had</p>
<p>graduated from grammar school and gone to work in the jute mills</p>
<p>for four dollars a week, three of which she had paid to Sarah.</p>
<p>&quot;How about that saloonkeeper?&quot; Billy asked. &quot;How come it he</p>
<p>adopted you?&quot;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &quot;I don&#x27;t know, except that all my</p>
<p>relatives were hard up. It seemed they just couldn&#x27;t get on. They</p>
<p>managed to scratch a lean living for themselves, and that was</p>
<p>all. Cady--he was the saloonkeeper--had been a soldier in my</p>
<p>father&#x27;s company, and he always swore by Captain Kit, which was</p>
<p>their nickname for him. My father had kept the surgeons from</p>
<p>amputating his leg in the war, and he never forgot it. He was</p>
<p>making money in the hotel and saloon, and I found out afterward</p>
<p>he helped out a lot to pay the doctors and to bury my mother</p>
<p>alongside of father. I was to go to Uncle Will--that was my</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s wish; but there had been fighting up in the Ventura</p>
<p>Mountains where his ranch was, and men had been killed. It was</p>
<p>about fences and cattlemen or something, and anyway he was in</p>
<p>jail a long time, and when he got his freedom the lawyers had got</p>
<p>his ranch. He was an old man, then, and broken, and his wife took</p>
<p>sick, and he got a job as night watchman for forty dollars a</p>
<p>month. So he couldn&#x27;t do anything for me, and Cady adopted me.</p>
<p>&quot;Cady was a good man, if he did run a saloon. His wife was a big,</p>
<p>handsome-looking woman. I don&#x27;t think she was all right . . . and</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve heard so since. But she was good to me. I don&#x27;t care what</p>
<p>they say about her, or what she was. She was awful good to me.</p>
<p>After he died, she went altogether bad, and so I went into the</p>
<p>orphan asylum. It wasn&#x27;t any too good there, and I had three</p>
<p>years of it. And then Tom had married and settled down to steady</p>
<p>work, and he took me out to live with him. And--well, I&#x27;ve been</p>
<p>working pretty steady ever since.&quot;</p>
<p>She gazed sadly away across the fields until her eyes came to</p>
<p>rest on a fence bright-splashed with poppies at its base. Billy,</p>
<p>who from his supine position had been looking up at her, studying</p>
<p>and pleasuring in the pointed oval of her woman&#x27;s face, reached</p>
<p>his hand out slowly as he murmured:</p>
<p>&quot;You poor little kid.&quot;</p>
<p>His hand closed sympathetically on her bare forearm, and as she</p>
<p>looked down to greet his eyes she saw in them suprise and</p>
<p>delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, ain&#x27;t your skin cool though,&quot; he said. &quot;Now me, I&#x27;m always</p>
<p>warm. Feel my hand.&quot;</p>
<p>It was warmly moist, and she noted microscopic beads of sweat on</p>
<p>his forehead and clean-shaven upper lip.</p>
<p>&quot;My, but you are sweaty.&quot;</p>
<p>She bent to him and with her handkerchief dabbed his lip and</p>
<p>forehead dry, then dried his palms.</p>
<p>&quot;I breathe through my skin, I guess,&quot; he explained. &quot;The wise</p>
<p>guys in the trainin&#x27; camps and gyms say it&#x27;s a good sign for</p>
<p>health. But somehow I&#x27;m sweatin&#x27; more than usual now. Funny,</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>She had been forced to unclasp his hand from her arm in order to</p>
<p>dry it, and when she finished, it returned to its old position.</p>
<p>&quot;But, say, ain&#x27;t your skin cool,&quot; he repeated with renewed</p>
<p>wonder. &quot;Soft as velvet, too, an&#x27; smooth as silk. It feels</p>
<p>great.&quot;</p>
<p>Gently explorative, he slid his hand from wrist to elbow and came</p>
<p>to rest half way back. Tired and languid from the morning in the</p>
<p>sun, she found herself thrilling to his touch and half-dreamily</p>
<p>deciding that here was a man she could love, hands and all.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I&#x27;ve taken the cool all out of that spot.&quot; He did not look</p>
<p>up to her, and she could see the roguish smile that curled on his</p>
<p>lips. &quot;So I guess I&#x27;ll try another.&quot;</p>
<p>He shifted his hand along her arm with soft sensuousness, and</p>
<p>she, looking down at his lips, remembered the long tingling they</p>
<p>had given hers the first time they had met.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on and talk,&quot; he urged, after a delicious five minutes of</p>
<p>silence. &quot;I like to watch your lips talking. It&#x27;s funny, but</p>
<p>every move they make looks like a tickly kiss.&quot;</p>
<p>Greatly she wanted to stay where she was. Instead, she said:</p>
<p>&quot;If I talk, you won&#x27;t like what I say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; he insisted. &quot;You can&#x27;t say anything I won&#x27;t like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there&#x27;s some poppies over there by the fence I want to</p>
<p>pick. And then it&#x27;s time for us to be going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I lose,&quot; he laughed. &quot;But you made twenty-five tickle kisses</p>
<p>just the same. I counted &#x27;em. I&#x27;ll tell you what: you sing &#x27;When</p>
<p>the Harvest Days Are Over,&#x27; and let me have your other cool arm</p>
<p>while you&#x27;re doin&#x27; it, and then we&#x27;ll go.&quot;</p>
<p>She sang looking down into his eyes, which ware centered, not on</p>
<p>hers, but on her lips. When she finished, she slipped his hands</p>
<p>from her arms and got up. He was about to start for the horses,</p>
<p>when she held her jacket out to him. Despite the independence</p>
<p>natural to a girl who earned her own living, she had an innate</p>
<p>love of the little services and finenesses; and, also, she</p>
<p>remembered from her childhood the talk by the pioneer women of</p>
<p>the courtesy and attendance of the caballeros of the</p>
<p>Spanish-California days.</p>
<p>Sunset greeted them when, after a wide circle to the east and</p>
<p>south, they cleared the divide of the Contra Costa hills and</p>
<p>began dropping down the long grade that led past Redwood Peak to</p>
<p>Fruitvale. Beneath them stretched the flatlands to the bay,</p>
<p>checkerboarded into fields and broken by the towns of Elmhurst,</p>
<p>San Leandro, and Haywards. The smoke of Oakland filled the</p>
<p>western sky with haze and murk, while beyond, across the bay,</p>
<p>they could see the first winking lights of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Darkness was on them, and Billy had become curiously silent. For</p>
<p>half an hour he had given no recognition of her existence save</p>
<p>once, when the chill evening wind caused him to tuck the robe</p>
<p>tightly about her and himself. Half a dozen times Saxon found</p>
<p>herself on the verge of the remark, &quot;What&#x27;s on your mind?&quot; but</p>
<p>each time let it remain unuttered. She sat very close to him. The</p>
<p>warmth of their bodies intermingled, and she was aware of a great</p>
<p>restfulness and content.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon,&quot; he began abruptly. &quot;It&#x27;s no use my holdin&#x27; it in</p>
<p>any longer. It&#x27;s ben in my mouth all day, ever since lunch.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the matter with you an&#x27; me gettin&#x27; married?&quot;</p>
<p>She knew, very quietly and very gladly, that he meant it.</p>
<p>Instinctively she wss impelled to hold off, to make him woo her,</p>
<p>to make herself more desirably valuable ere she yielded. Further,</p>
<p>her woman&#x27;s sensitiveness and pride were offended. She had never</p>
<p>dreamed of so forthright and bald a proposal from the man to whom</p>
<p>she would give herself. The simplicity and directness of Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>proposal constituted almost a hurt. On the other hand she wanted</p>
<p>him so much--how much she had not realized until now, when he had</p>
<p>so unexpectedly made himself accessible.</p>
<p>&quot;Well you gotta say something, Saxon. Hand it to me, good or bad;</p>
<p>but anyway hand it to me. An&#x27; just take into consideration that I</p>
<p>love you. Why, I love you like the very devil, Saxon. I must,</p>
<p>because I&#x27;m askin&#x27; you to marry me, an&#x27; I never asked any girl</p>
<p>that before.&quot;</p>
<p>Another silence fell, and Saxon found herself dwelling on the</p>
<p>warmth, tingling now, under the lap-robe. When she realized</p>
<p>whither her thoughts led, she blushed guiltily in the darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;How old are you, Billy?&quot; she questioned, with a suddenness and</p>
<p>irrelevance as disconcerting as his first words had been.</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty-two,&quot; he answered.</p>
<p>&quot;I am twenty-four.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As if I didn&#x27;t know. When you left the orphan asylum and how old</p>
<p>you were, how long you worked in the jute mills, the cannery, the</p>
<p>paper-box factory, the laundry--maybe you think I can&#x27;t do</p>
<p>addition. I knew how old you was, even to your birthday.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I&#x27;m two years older.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What of it? If it counted for anything, I wouldn&#x27;t be lovin&#x27;</p>
<p>you, would I? Your mother was dead right. Love&#x27;s the big stuff.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s what counts. Don&#x27;t you see? I juat love you, an&#x27; I gotta</p>
<p>have you. It&#x27;s natural, I guess; and I&#x27;ve always found with</p>
<p>horses, dogs, and other folks, that what&#x27;s natural is right.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no gettin&#x27; away from it, Saxon; I gotta have you, an&#x27; I&#x27;m</p>
<p>just hopin&#x27; hard you gotta have me. Maybe my hands ain&#x27;t soft</p>
<p>like bookkeepers&#x27; an&#x27; clerks, but they can work for you, an&#x27;</p>
<p>fight like Sam Hill for you, and, Saxon, they can love you.&quot;</p>
<p>The old sex antagonism which she had always experienced with men</p>
<p>seemed to have vanished. She had no sense of being on the</p>
<p>defensive. This was no game. It was what she had been looking for</p>
<p>and dreaming about. Before Billy she was defenseless, and there</p>
<p>was an all-satisfaction in the knowledge. She could deny him</p>
<p>nothing. Not even if he proved to be like the others. And out of</p>
<p>the greatness of the thought rose a greater thought--he would not</p>
<p>so prove himself.</p>
<p>She did not speak. Instead, in a glow of spirit and flesh, she</p>
<p>reached out to his left hand and gently tried to remove it from</p>
<p>the rein. He did not understand; but when she persisted he</p>
<p>shifted the rein to his right and let her have her will with the</p>
<p>other hand. Her head bent over it, and she kissed the teamster</p>
<p>callouses.</p>
<p>For the moment he was stunned.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean it?&quot; he stammered.</p>
<p>For reply, she kissed the hand again and murmured:</p>
<p>&quot;I love your hands, Billy. To me they are the most beautiful</p>
<p>hands in the world, and it would take hours of talking to tell</p>
<p>you all they mean to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa!&quot; he called to the horses.</p>
<p>He pulled them in to a standstill, soothed them with his voice,</p>
<p>and made the reins fast around the whip. Then he turned to her</p>
<p>with arms around her and lips to lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Billy, I&#x27;ll make you a good wife,&quot; she sobbed, when the kiss</p>
<p>was broken.</p>
<p>He kissed her wet eyes and found her lips again.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you know what I was thinkin&#x27; and why I was sweatin&#x27; when we</p>
<p>was eatin&#x27; lunch. Just seemed I couldn&#x27;t hold in much longer from</p>
<p>tellin&#x27; you. Why, you know, you looked good to me from the first</p>
<p>moment I spotted you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I think I loved you from that first day, too, Billy. And I</p>
<p>was so proud of you all that day, you were so kind and gentle,</p>
<p>and so strong, and the way the men all respected you and the</p>
<p>girls all wanted you, and the way you fought those three Irishmen</p>
<p>when I was behind the picnic table. I couldn&#x27;t love or marry a</p>
<p>man I wasn&#x27;t proud of, and I&#x27;m so proud of you, so proud.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not half as much as I am right now of myself,&quot; he answered, &quot;for</p>
<p>having won you. It&#x27;s too good to he true. Maybe the alarm</p>
<p>clock&#x27;ll go off and wake me up in a couple of minutes. Well,</p>
<p>anyway, if it does, I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to make the best of them two</p>
<p>minutes first. Watch out I don&#x27;t eat you, I&#x27;m that hungry for</p>
<p>you.&quot;</p>
<p>He smothered her in an embrace, holding her so tightly to him</p>
<p>that it almost hurt. After what was to her an age-long period of</p>
<p>bliss, his arms relaxed and he seemed to make an effort to draw</p>
<p>himself together.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; the clock ain&#x27;t gone off yet,&quot; he whispered against her</p>
<p>cheek. &quot;And it&#x27;s a dark night, an&#x27; there&#x27;s Fruitvale right ahead,</p>
<p>an&#x27; if there ain&#x27;t King and Prince standin&#x27; still in the middle</p>
<p>of the road. I never thought the time&#x27;d come when I wouldn&#x27;t want</p>
<p>to take the ribbons on a fine pair of horses. But this is that</p>
<p>time. I just can&#x27;t let go of you, and I&#x27;ve gotta some time</p>
<p>to-night. It hurts worse&#x27;n poison, but here goes.&quot;</p>
<p>He restored her to herself, tucked the disarranged robe about</p>
<p>her, and chirruped to the impatient team.</p>
<p>Half an hour later he called &quot;Whoa!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know I&#x27;m awake now, but I don&#x27;t know but maybe I dreamed all</p>
<p>the rest, and I just want to make sure.&quot;</p>
<p>And again be made the reins fast and took her in his arms.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>The days flew by for Saxon. She worked on steadily at the</p>
<p>laundry, even doing more overtime than usual, and all her free</p>
<p>waking hours were devoted to preparations for the great change</p>
<p>and to Billy. He had proved himself God&#x27;s own impetuous lover by</p>
<p>insisting on getting married the next day after the proposal, and</p>
<p>then by resolutely refusing to compromise on more than a week&#x27;s</p>
<p>delay.</p>
<p>&quot;Why wait?&quot; he demanded. &quot;We&#x27;re not gettin&#x27; any younger so far as</p>
<p>I can notice, an&#x27; think of all we lose every day we wait.&quot;</p>
<p>In the end, he gave in to a month, which was well, for in two</p>
<p>weeks he was transferred, with half a dozen other drivers, to</p>
<p>work from the big stables of Corberly and Morrison in West</p>
<p>Oakland. House-hunting in the other end of town ceased, and on</p>
<p>Pine Street, between Fifth and Fourth, and in immediate proximity</p>
<p>to the great Southern Pacific railroad yards, Billy and Saxon</p>
<p>rented a neat cottage of four small rooms for ten dollars a</p>
<p>month.</p>
<p>&quot;Dog-cheap is what I call it, when I think of the small rooms</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve ben soaked for,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s judgment. &quot;Look at the one I</p>
<p>got now, not as big as the smallest here, an&#x27; me payin&#x27; six</p>
<p>dollars a month for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s furnished,&quot; Saxon remmded him. &quot;You see, that makes a</p>
<p>difference.&quot;</p>
<p>But Billy didn&#x27;t see.</p>
<p>&quot;I ain&#x27;t much of a scholar, Saxon, but I know simple arithmetic;</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve soaked my watch when I was hard up, and I can calculate</p>
<p>interest. How much do you figure it will cost to furnish the</p>
<p>house, carpets on the floor, linoleum on the kitchen, and all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We can do it nicely for three hundred dollars,&quot; she answered.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking it over and I&#x27;m sure we can do it for that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Three hundred,&quot; he muttered, wrinkling his brows with</p>
<p>concentration. &quot;Three hundred, say at six per cent.--that&#x27;d be</p>
<p>six cents on the dollar, sixty cents on ten dollars, six dollars</p>
<p>on the hundred, on three hundred eighteen dollars. Say--I&#x27;m a</p>
<p>bear at multiplyin&#x27; by ten. Now divide eighteen by twelve, that&#x27;d</p>
<p>be a dollar an&#x27; a half a month interest.&quot; He stopped, satisfied</p>
<p>that he had proved his contention. Then his face quickened with a</p>
<p>fresh thought. &quot;Hold on! That ain&#x27;t all. That&#x27;d be the interest</p>
<p>on the furniture for four rooms. Divide by four. What&#x27;s a dollar</p>
<p>an&#x27; a half divided by four?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Four into fifteen, three times and three to carry,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>recited glibly. &quot;Four into thirty is seven, twenty-eight, two to</p>
<p>carry; and two-fourths is one-half. There you are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee! You&#x27;re the real bear at figures.&quot; He hesitated. &quot;I didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>follow you. How much did you say it was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty-seven and a half cents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, ha! Now we&#x27;ll see how much I&#x27;ve ben gouged for my one room.</p>
<p>Ten dollars a month for four rooms is two an&#x27; a half for one. Add</p>
<p>thirty-seven an&#x27; a half cents interest on furniture, an&#x27; that</p>
<p>makes two dollars an&#x27; eighty-seven an&#x27; a half cents. Subtract</p>
<p>from six dollars ...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Three dollars and twelve and a half cents,&quot; she supplied</p>
<p>quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;There we are! Three dollars an&#x27; twelve an&#x27; a half cents I&#x27;m</p>
<p>jiggered out of on the room I&#x27;m rentin&#x27;. Say! Bein&#x27; married is</p>
<p>like savin&#x27; money, ain&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But furniture wears out, Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By golly, I never thought of that. It ought to be figured, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&#x27;ve got a snap here, and next Saturday afternoon you&#x27;ve</p>
<p>gotta get off from the laundry so as we can go an&#x27; buy our</p>
<p>furniture. I saw Salinger&#x27;s last night. I give&#x27;m fifty down, and</p>
<p>the rest installment plan, ten dollars a month. In twenty-five</p>
<p>months the furniture&#x27;s ourn. An&#x27; remember, Saxon, you wanta buy</p>
<p>everything you want, no matter how much it costs. No scrimpin&#x27; on</p>
<p>what&#x27;s for you an&#x27; me. Get me?&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded, with no betrayal on her face of the myriad secret</p>
<p>economies that filled her mind. A hint of moisture glistened in</p>
<p>her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re so good to me, Billy,&quot; she murmured, as she came to him</p>
<p>and was met inside his arms.</p>
<p>&quot;So you&#x27;ve gone an&#x27; done it,&quot; Mary commented, one morning in the</p>
<p>laundry. They had not been at work ten minutes ere her eye had</p>
<p>glimpsed the topaz ring on the third finger of Saxon&#x27;s left hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Who&#x27;s the lucky one? Charley Long or Billy Roberts?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Billy,&quot; was the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh! Takin&#x27; a young boy to raise, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon showed that the stab had gone home, and Mary was all</p>
<p>contrition.</p>
<p>&quot;Can&#x27;t you take a josh? I&#x27;m glad to death at the news. Billy&#x27;s a</p>
<p>awful good man, and I&#x27;m glad to see you get him. There ain&#x27;t many</p>
<p>like him knockin&#x27; &#x27;round, an&#x27; they ain&#x27;t to be had for the</p>
<p>askin&#x27;. An&#x27; you&#x27;re both lucky. You was just made for each other,</p>
<p>an&#x27; you&#x27;ll make him a better wife than any girl I know. when is</p>
<p>it to be?&quot;</p>
<p>Going home from the laundry a few days later, Saxon encountered</p>
<p>Charley Long. He blocked the sidewalk, and compelled speech with</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>&quot;So you&#x27;re runnin&#x27; with a prizefighter,&quot; he sneered. &quot;A blind man</p>
<p>can see your finish.&quot;</p>
<p>For the first time she was unafraid of this big-bodied,</p>
<p>black-browed men with the hairy-matted hands and fingers. She</p>
<p>held up her left hand.</p>
<p>&quot;See that? It&#x27;s something, with all your strength, that you could</p>
<p>never put on my finger. Billy Roberts put it on inside a week. He</p>
<p>got your number, Charley Long, and at the same time he got me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Skiddoo for you,&quot; Long retorted. &quot;Twenty-three&#x27;s your number.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s not like you,&quot; Saxon went on. &quot;He&#x27;s a man, every bit of</p>
<p>him, a fine, clean man.&quot;</p>
<p>Long laughed hoarsely.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s got your goat all right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yours,&quot; she flashed back.</p>
<p>&quot;I could tell you things about him. Saxon, straight, he ain&#x27;t no</p>
<p>good. If I was to tell you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;d better get out of my way,&quot; she interrupted, &quot;or I&#x27;ll tell</p>
<p>him, and you know what you&#x27;ll get, you great big bully.&quot;</p>
<p>Long shuffled uneasily, then reluctantly stepped aside.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a caution,&quot; he said, half admiiringly.</p>
<p>&quot;So&#x27;s Billy Roberts,&quot; she laughed, and continned on her way.</p>
<p>After half a dozen steps she stopped. &quot;Say,&quot; she called.</p>
<p>The big blacksmith turned toward her with eagerness.</p>
<p>&quot;About a block back,&quot; she said, &quot;I saw a man with hip disease.</p>
<p>You might go and beat him up.&quot;</p>
<p>Of one extravagance Saxon was guilty in the course of the brief</p>
<p>engagement period. A full day&#x27;s wages she spent in the purchase</p>
<p>of half a dozen cabinet photographs of herself. Billy had</p>
<p>insisted that life was unendurable could he not look upon her</p>
<p>semblance the last thing when he went to bed at night and the</p>
<p>first thing when he got up in the morning. In return, his</p>
<p>photographs, one conventional and one in the stripped fighting</p>
<p>costume of the ring, ornamented her looking glass. It was while</p>
<p>gazing at the latter that she was reminded of her wonderful</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s tales of the ancient Saxons and sea-foragers of the</p>
<p>English coasts. From the chest of drawers that had crossed the</p>
<p>plains she drew forth another of her several precious heirloom--a</p>
<p>scrap-book of her mother&#x27;s in which was pasted much of the</p>
<p>fugitive newspaper verse of pioneer California days. Also, there</p>
<p>were copies of paintings and old wood engravings from the</p>
<p>magazines of a generation and more before.</p>
<p>Saxon ran the pages with familiar fingers and stopped at the</p>
<p>picture she was seeking. Between bold headlands of rock and under</p>
<p>a gray cloud-blown sky, a dozen boats, long and lean and dark,</p>
<p>beaked like monstrous birds, were landing on a foam-whitened</p>
<p>beach of sand. The men in the boats, half naked, huge-muscled and</p>
<p>fair-haired, wore winged helmets. In their hands were swords and</p>
<p>spears, and they were leaping, waist-deep, into the sea-wash and</p>
<p>wading ashore. Opposed to them, contesting the landing, were</p>
<p>skin-clad savages, unlike Indians, however, who clustered on the</p>
<p>beach or waded into the water to their knees. The first blows</p>
<p>were being struck, and here and there the bodies of the dead and</p>
<p>wounded rolled in the surf. One fair-haired invader lay across</p>
<p>the gunwale of a boat, the manner of his death told by the arrow</p>
<p>that transfixed his breast. In the air, leaping past him into the</p>
<p>water, sword in hand, was Billy. There was no mistaking it. The</p>
<p>striking blondness, the face, the eyes, the mouth were the same.</p>
<p>The very expression on the face was what had been on Billy&#x27;s the</p>
<p>day of the picnic when he faced the three wild Irishmen.</p>
<p>Somewhere out of the ruck of those warring races had emerged</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s ancestors, and hers, was her afterthought, as she closed</p>
<p>the book and put it back in the drawer. And some of those</p>
<p>ancestors had made this ancient and battered chest of drawers</p>
<p>which had crossed the salt ocean and the plains and been pierced</p>
<p>by a bullet in the fight with the Indians at Little Meadow.</p>
<p>Almost, it seemed, she could visualize the women who had kept</p>
<p>their pretties and their family homespun in its drawers--the</p>
<p>women of those wandering generations who were grandmothers and</p>
<p>greater great grandmothers of her own mother. Well, she sighed,</p>
<p>it was a good stock to be born of, a hard-working, hard-fighting</p>
<p>stock. She fell to wondering what her life would have been like</p>
<p>had she been born a Chinese woman, or an Italian woman like those</p>
<p>she saw, head-shawled or bareheaded, squat, ungainly and swarthy,</p>
<p>who carried great loads of driftwood on their heads up from tha</p>
<p>beach. Then she laughed at her foolishness, remembered Billy and</p>
<p>the four-roomed cottage on Pine Street, and went to bed with her</p>
<p>mind filled for the hundredth time with the details of the</p>
<p>furniture.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<p>&quot;Our cattle were all played out,&quot; Saxon was saying, &quot;and winter</p>
<p>was so near that we couldn&#x27;t dare try to cross the Great American</p>
<p>Desert, so our train stopped in Salt Lake City that winter. The</p>
<p>Mormons hadn&#x27;t got bad yet, and they were good to us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You talk as though you were there,&quot; Bert commented.</p>
<p>&quot;My mother was,&quot; Saxon answered proudly. &quot;She was nine years old</p>
<p>that winter.&quot;</p>
<p>They were seated around the table in the kitchen of the little</p>
<p>Pine Street cottage, making a cold lunch of sandwiches, tamales,</p>
<p>and bottled beer. It being Sunday, the four were free from work,</p>
<p>and they had come early, to work harder than on any week day,</p>
<p>washing walls and windows, scrubbing floors, laying carpets and</p>
<p>linoleum, hanging curtains, setting up the stove, putting the</p>
<p>kitchen utensils and dishes away, and placing the furniture.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on with the story, Saxon,&quot; Mary begged. &quot;I&#x27;m just dyin&#x27; to</p>
<p>hear. And Bert, you just shut up and listen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that winter was when Del Hancock showed up. He was</p>
<p>Kentucky born, but he&#x27;d been in the West for years. He was a</p>
<p>scout, like Kit Carson, and he knew him well. Many&#x27;s a time Kit</p>
<p>Carson and he slept under the same blankets. They were together</p>
<p>to California and Oregon with General Fremont. Well, Del Hancock</p>
<p>was passing on his way through Salt Lake, going I don&#x27;t know</p>
<p>where to raise a company of Rocky Mountain trappers to go after</p>
<p>beaver some new place he knew about. Ha was a handsome man. He</p>
<p>wore his hair long like in pictures, and had a silk sash around</p>
<p>his waist he&#x27;d learned to wear in California from the Spanish,</p>
<p>and two revolvers in his belt. Any woman &#x27;d fall in love with him</p>
<p>first sight. Well, he saw Sadie, who was my mother&#x27;s oldest</p>
<p>sister, and I guess she looked good to him, for he stopped right</p>
<p>there in Salt Lake and didn&#x27;t go a step. He was a great Indian</p>
<p>fighter, too, and I heard my Aunt Villa say, when I was a little</p>
<p>girl, that he had the blackest, brightest eyes, and that the way</p>
<p>he looked was like an eagle. He&#x27;d fought duels, too, the way they</p>
<p>did in those days, and he wasn&#x27;t afraid of anything.</p>
<p>&quot;Sadie was a beauty, and she flirted with him and drove him</p>
<p>crazy. Maybe she wasn&#x27;t sure of her own mind, I don&#x27;t know. But I</p>
<p>do know that she didn&#x27;t give in as easy as I did to Billy.</p>
<p>Finally, he couldn&#x27;t stand it any more. Ha rode up that night on</p>
<p>horseback, wild as could be. &#x27;Sadie,&#x27; he said, &#x27;if you don&#x27;t</p>
<p>promise to marry me to-morrow, I&#x27;ll shoot myself to-night right</p>
<p>back of the corral.&#x27; And he&#x27;d have done it, too, and Sadie knew</p>
<p>it, and said she would. Didn&#x27;t they make love fast in those</p>
<p>days?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Mary sniffed. &quot;A week after you first laid</p>
<p>eyes on Billy you was engaged. Did Billy say he was going to</p>
<p>shoot himself back of the laundry if you turned him down?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t give him a chance,&quot; Saxon confessed. &quot;Anyway Del</p>
<p>Hancock and Aunt Sadie got married next day. And they were very</p>
<p>happy afterward, only she died. And after that he was killed,</p>
<p>with General Custer and all the rest, by the Indians. He was an</p>
<p>old man by then, but I guess he got his share of Indians before</p>
<p>they got him. Men like him always died fighting, and they took</p>
<p>their dead with them. I used to know Al Stanley when I was a</p>
<p>little girl. He was a gambler, but he was game. A railroad man</p>
<p>shot him in the back when he was sitting at a table. That shot</p>
<p>killed him, too. He died in about two seconds. But before he died</p>
<p>he&#x27;d pulled his gun and put three bullets into the man that</p>
<p>killed him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t like fightin&#x27;,&quot; Mary protested. &quot;It makes me nervous.</p>
<p>Bert gives me the willies the way he&#x27;s always lookin&#x27; for</p>
<p>trouble. There ain&#x27;t no sense in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I wouldn&#x27;t give a snap of my fingers for a man without</p>
<p>fighting spirit,&quot; Saxon answered. &quot;why, we wouldn&#x27;t be here</p>
<p>to-day if it wasn&#x27;t for the fighting spirit of our people before</p>
<p>us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve got the real goods of a fighter in Billy,&quot; Bert assured</p>
<p>her; &quot;a yard long and a yard wide and genuine A Number One,</p>
<p>long-fleeced wool. Billy&#x27;s a Mohegan with a scalp-lock, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>what he is. And when he gets his mad up it&#x27;s a case of get out</p>
<p>from under or something will fall on you--hard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just like that,&quot; Mary added.</p>
<p>Billy, who had taken no part in the conversation, got up, glanced</p>
<p>into the bedroom off the kitchen, went into the parlor and the</p>
<p>bedroom off the parlor, then returned and stood gazing with</p>
<p>puzzled brows into the kitchen bedroom.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s eatin&#x27; you, old man,&quot; Bert queried. &quot;You look as though</p>
<p>you&#x27;d lost something or was markin&#x27; a three-way ticket. What you</p>
<p>got on your chest? Cough it up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I&#x27;m just thinkin&#x27; where in Sam Hill&#x27;s the bed an&#x27; stuff for</p>
<p>the back bedroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There isn&#x27;t any,&quot; Saxon explained. &quot;We didn&#x27;t order any.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;ll see about it to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What d&#x27;ye want another bed for?&quot; asked Bert. &quot;Ain&#x27;t one bed</p>
<p>enough for the two of you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shut up, Bert!&quot; Mary cried. &quot;Don&#x27;t get raw.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, Mary!&quot; Bert grinned. &quot;Back up. You&#x27;re in the wrong stall</p>
<p>as usual.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#x27;t need that room,&quot; Saxon was saying to Billy. &quot;And so I</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t plan any furniture. That money went to buy better carpets</p>
<p>and a better stove.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy came over to her, lifted her from the chair, and seated</p>
<p>himself with her on his knees.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, little girl. I&#x27;m glad you did. The best for us</p>
<p>every time. And to-morrow night I want you to run up with me to</p>
<p>Salinger&#x27;s an&#x27; pick out a good bedroom set an&#x27; carpet for that</p>
<p>room. And it must be good. Nothin&#x27; snide.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will cost fifty dollars,&quot; she objected.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; he nodded. &quot;Make it cost fifty dollars and not a</p>
<p>cent less. We&#x27;re goin&#x27; to have the best. And what&#x27;s the good of</p>
<p>an empty room? It&#x27;d make the house look cheap. Why, I go around</p>
<p>now, seein&#x27; this little nest just as it grows an&#x27; softens, day by</p>
<p>day, from the day we paid the cash money down an&#x27; nailed the</p>
<p>keys. Why, almost every moment I&#x27;m drivin&#x27; the horses, all day</p>
<p>long, I just keep on seein&#x27; this nest. And when we&#x27;re married,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll go on seein&#x27; it. And I want to see it complete. If that</p>
<p>room&#x27;d he bare-floored an&#x27; empty, I&#x27;d see nothin&#x27; but it and its</p>
<p>bare floor all day long. I&#x27;d be cheated. The house&#x27;d be a lie.</p>
<p>Look at them curtains you put up in it, Saxon. That&#x27;s to make</p>
<p>believe to the neighbors that it&#x27;s furnished. Saxon, them</p>
<p>curtains are lyin&#x27; about that room, makin&#x27; a noise for every one</p>
<p>to hear that that room&#x27;s furnished. Nitsky for us. I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>see that them curtains tell the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You might rent it,&quot; Bert suggested. &quot;You&#x27;re close to the</p>
<p>railroad yards, and it&#x27;s only two blocks to a restaurant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not on your life. I ain&#x27;t marryin&#x27; Saxon to take in lodgers. If</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t take care of her, d&#x27;ye know what I&#x27;ll do ? Go down to</p>
<p>Long Wharf, say &#x27;Here goes nothin&#x27;,&#x27; an&#x27; jump into the bay with a</p>
<p>stone tied to my neck. Ain&#x27;t I right, Saxon?&quot;</p>
<p>It was contrary to her prudent judgment, but it fanned her pride.</p>
<p>She threw her arms around her lover&#x27;s neck, and said, ere she</p>
<p>kissed him:</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re the boss, Billy. What you say goes, and always will go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to that!&quot; Bert gibed to Mary. &quot;That&#x27;s the stuff. Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>onto her job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess we&#x27;ll talk things over together first before ever I do</p>
<p>anything,&quot; Billy was saying to Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to that,&quot; Mary triumphed. &quot;You bet the man that marries</p>
<p>me&#x27;ll have to talk things over first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Billy&#x27;s only givin&#x27; her hot air,&quot; Bert plagued. &quot;They all do it</p>
<p>before they&#x27;re married.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary sniffed contemptuously.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll bet Saxon leads him around by the nose. And I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>say, loud an&#x27; strong, that I&#x27;ll lead the man around by the nose</p>
<p>that marries me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not if you love him,&quot; Saxon interposed.</p>
<p>&quot;All the more reason,&quot; Mary pursued.</p>
<p>Bert assumed an expression and attitude of mournful dejection.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you see why me an&#x27; Mary don&#x27;t get married,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m</p>
<p>some big Indian myself, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll be everlastingly jiggerooed if I</p>
<p>put up for a wigwam I can&#x27;t be boss of.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#x27;m no squaw,&quot; Mary retaliated, &quot;an&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t marry a big</p>
<p>buck Indian if all the rest of the men in the world was dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well this big buck Indian ain&#x27;t asked you yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He knows what he&#x27;d get if he did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And after that maybe he&#x27;ll think twice before he does ask you.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon, intent on diverting the conversation into pleasanter</p>
<p>channels, clapped her hands as if with sudden recollection.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! I forgot! I want to show you something.&quot; From her purse she</p>
<p>drew a slender ring of plain gold and passed it around. &quot;My</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s wedding ring. I&#x27;ve worn it around my neck always, like a</p>
<p>locket. I cried for it so in the orphan asylum that the matron</p>
<p>gave it back for me to wear. And now, just to think, after next</p>
<p>Tuesday I&#x27;ll be wearing it on my finger. Look, Billy, see the</p>
<p>engraving on the inside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;C to D, 1879,&quot; he read.</p>
<p>&quot;Carlton to Daisy--Carlton was my father&#x27;s first name. And now,</p>
<p>Billy, you&#x27;ve got to get it engraved for you and me.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary was all eagerness and delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s fine,&quot; she cried. &quot;W to S, 1907.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy considered a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;No, that wouldn&#x27;t be right, because I&#x27;m not giving it to Saxon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;W and S.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope.&quot; Billy shook his head. &quot;S and W, because you come first</p>
<p>with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I come first with you, you come first with us. Billy, dear, I</p>
<p>insist on W and S.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You see,&quot; Mary said to Bert. &quot;Having her own way and leading him</p>
<p>by the nose already.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon acknowledged the sting.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway you want, Billy,&quot; she surrendered. His arms tightened</p>
<p>about her.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll talk it over first, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>Sarah was conservative. Worse, she had crystallized at the end of</p>
<p>her love-time with the coming of her first child. After that she</p>
<p>was as set in her ways as plaster in a mold. Her mold was the</p>
<p>prejudices and notions of her girlhood and the house she lived</p>
<p>in. So habitual was she that any change in the customary round</p>
<p>assumed the proportions of a revolution. Tom had gone through</p>
<p>many of these revolutions, three of them when he moved house.</p>
<p>Then his stamina broke, and he never moved house again.</p>
<p>So it was that Saxon had held back the announcement of her</p>
<p>approaching marriage until it was unavoidable. She expected a</p>
<p>scene, and she got it.</p>
<p>&quot;A prizefighter, a hoodlum, a plug-ugly,&quot; Sarah sneered, after</p>
<p>she had exhausted herself of all calamitous forecasts of her own</p>
<p>future and the future of her children in the absence of Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>weekly four dollars and a half. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what your mother&#x27;d</p>
<p>thought if she lived to see the day when you took up with a tough</p>
<p>like Bill Roberts. Bill! Why, your mother was too refined to</p>
<p>associate with a man that was called Bill. And all I can say is</p>
<p>you can say good-bye to silk stockings and your three pair of</p>
<p>shoes. It won&#x27;t be long before you&#x27;ll think yourself lucky to go</p>
<p>sloppin&#x27; around in Congress gaiters and cotton stockin&#x27;s two pair</p>
<p>for a quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I&#x27;m not afraid of Billy not being able to keep me in all</p>
<p>kinds of shoes,&quot; Saxon retorted with a proud toss of her head.</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re talkin&#x27; about.&quot; Sarah paused to laugh</p>
<p>in mirthless discordance. &quot;Watch for the babies to come. They</p>
<p>come faster than wages raise these days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we&#x27;re not going to have any babies ... that is, at first.</p>
<p>Not until after the furniture is all paid for anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wise in your generation, eh? In my days girls were more modest</p>
<p>than to know anything about disgraceful subjects.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As babies?&quot; Saxon queried, with a touch of gentle malice.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, as babies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The first I knew that babies were disgraceful. Why, Sarah, you,</p>
<p>with your five, how disgraceful you have been. Billy and I have</p>
<p>decided not to be half as disgraceful. We&#x27;re only going to have</p>
<p>two--a boy and a girl.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom chuckled, but held the peace by hiding his face in his coffee</p>
<p>cup. Sarah, though checked by this flank attack, was herself an</p>
<p>old hand in the art. So temporary was the setback that she</p>
<p>scarcely paused ere hurling her assault from a new angle.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; marryin&#x27; so quick, all of a sudden, eh? If that ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>suspicious, nothin&#x27; is. I don&#x27;t know what young women&#x27;s comin&#x27;</p>
<p>to. They ain&#x27;t decent, I tell you. They ain&#x27;t decent. That&#x27;s what</p>
<p>comes of Sunday dancin&#x27; an&#x27; all the rest. Young women nowadays</p>
<p>are like a lot of animals. Such fast an&#x27; looseness I never saw</p>
<p>...&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was white with anger, but while Sarah wandered on in her</p>
<p>diatribe, Tom managed to wink privily and prodigiously at his</p>
<p>sister and to implore her to help in keeping the peace.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right, kid sister,&quot; he comforted Saxon when they were</p>
<p>alone. &quot;There&#x27;s no use talkin&#x27; to Sarah. Bill Roberts is a good</p>
<p>boy. I know a lot about him. It does you proud to get him for a</p>
<p>husband. You&#x27;re bound to he happy with him . . .&quot; His voice sank,</p>
<p>and his face seemed suddenly to be very old and tired as he went</p>
<p>on anxiously. &quot;Take warning from Sarah. Don&#x27;t nag. Whatever you</p>
<p>do, don&#x27;t nag. Don&#x27;t give him a perpetual-motion line of chin.</p>
<p>Kind of let him talk once in a while. Men have some horse sense,</p>
<p>though Sarah don&#x27;t know it. Why, Sarah actually loves me, though</p>
<p>she don&#x27;t make a noise like it. The thing for you is to love your</p>
<p>husband, and, by thunder, to make a noise of lovin&#x27; him, too. And</p>
<p>then you can kid him into doing &#x27;most anything you want. Let him</p>
<p>have his way once in a while, and he&#x27;ll let you have yourn. But</p>
<p>you just go on lovin&#x27; him, and leanin&#x27; on his judgement--he&#x27;s no</p>
<p>fool--and you&#x27;ll be all hunky-dory. I&#x27;m scared from goin&#x27; wrong,</p>
<p>what of Sarah. But I&#x27;d sooner be loved into not going wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I&#x27;ll do it, Tom,&quot; Saxon nodded, smiling through the tears</p>
<p>his sympathy had brought into her eyes. &quot;And on top of it I&#x27;m</p>
<p>going to do something else, I&#x27;m going to make Billy love me and</p>
<p>just keep on loving me. And then I won&#x27;t have to kid him into</p>
<p>doing some of the things I want. He&#x27;ll do them because he loves</p>
<p>me, you see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You got the right idea, Saxon. Stick with it, an&#x27; you&#x27;ll win</p>
<p>out.&quot;</p>
<p>Later, when she had put on her hat to start for the laundry, she</p>
<p>found Tom waiting for her at the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27;, Saxon,&quot; he said, hastily and haltingly, &quot;you won&#x27;t take</p>
<p>anything I&#x27;ve said . . . you know . .--about Sarah . . . as bein&#x27;</p>
<p>in any way disloyal to her? She&#x27;s a good woman, an&#x27; faithful. An&#x27;</p>
<p>her life ain&#x27;t so easy by a long shot. I&#x27;d bite out my tongue</p>
<p>before I&#x27;d say anything against her. I gueas all folks have their</p>
<p>troubles. It&#x27;s hell to be poor, ain&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve been awful good to me, Tom. I can never forget it. And I</p>
<p>know Sarah means right. She does do her best.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won&#x27;t be able to give you a wedding present,&quot; her brother</p>
<p>ventured apologetically. &quot;Sarah won&#x27;t hear of it. Says we didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>get none from my folks when we got married. But I got something</p>
<p>for you just the same. A surprise. You&#x27;d never guess it.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon waited.</p>
<p>&quot;When you told me you was goin&#x27; to get married, I just happened</p>
<p>to think of it, an&#x27; I wrote to brother George, askin&#x27; him for it</p>
<p>for you. An&#x27; by thunder he sent it by express. I didn&#x27;t tell you</p>
<p>because I didn&#x27;t know but maybe he&#x27;d sold it. He did sell the</p>
<p>silver spurs. He needed the money, I guess. But the other, I had</p>
<p>it sent to the shop so as not to bother Sarah, an&#x27; I sneaked it</p>
<p>in last night an&#x27; hid it in the woodshed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it is something of my father&#x27;s! What is it? Oh, what is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His army sword.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The one he wore on his roan war horse! Oh, Tom, you couldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>give me a better present. Let&#x27;s go back now. I want to see it. We</p>
<p>can slip in the back way. Sarah&#x27;s washing in the kitchen, and she</p>
<p>won&#x27;t begin hanging out for an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I spoke to Sarah about lettin&#x27; you take the old chest of drawers</p>
<p>that was your mother&#x27;s,&quot; Tom whispered, as they stole along the</p>
<p>narrow alley between the houses. &quot;Only she got on her high horse.</p>
<p>Said that Daisy was as much my mother as yourn, even if we did</p>
<p>have different fathers, and that the chest had always belonged in</p>
<p>Daisy&#x27;s family and not Captain Kit&#x27;s, an&#x27; that it was mine, an&#x27;</p>
<p>what was mine she had some say-so about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right,&quot; Saxon reassured him. &quot;She sold it to me last</p>
<p>night. She was waiting up for me when I got home with fire in her</p>
<p>eye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep, she was on the warpath all day after I mentioned it. How</p>
<p>much did you give her for it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Six dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Robbery--it ain&#x27;t worth it,&quot; Tom groaned. &quot;It&#x27;s all cracked at</p>
<p>one end and as old as the hills.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d have given ten dollars for it. I&#x27;d have given &#x27;most anything</p>
<p>for it, Tom. It was mother&#x27;s, you know. I remember it in her room</p>
<p>when she was still alive.&quot;</p>
<p>In the woodshed Tom resurrected the hidden treasure and took off</p>
<p>the wrapping paper. Appeared a rusty, steel-scabbarded saber of</p>
<p>the heavy type carried by cavalry officers in Civil War days. It</p>
<p>was attached to a moth-eaten sash of thick-woven crimson silk</p>
<p>from which hung heavy silk tassels. Saxon almost seized it from</p>
<p>her brother in her eagerness. She drew forth the blade and</p>
<p>pressed her lips to the steel.</p>
<p>It was her last day at the laundry. She was to quit work that</p>
<p>evening for good. And the next afternoon, at five, she and Billy</p>
<p>were to go before a justice of the peace and be married. Bert and</p>
<p>Mary were to be the witnesses, and after that the four were to go</p>
<p>to a private room in Barnum&#x27;s Restaurant for the wedding supper.</p>
<p>That over, Bert and Mary would proceed to a dance at Myrtle Hall,</p>
<p>while Billy and Saxon would take the Eighth Street car to Seventh</p>
<p>and Pine. Honeymoons are infrequent in the working class. The</p>
<p>next morning Billy must be at the stable at his regular hour to</p>
<p>drive his team out.</p>
<p>All the women in the fancy starch room knew it was Saxon&#x27;s last</p>
<p>day. Many exulted for her, and not a few were envious of her, in</p>
<p>that she had won a husband and to freedom from the suffocating</p>
<p>slavery of the ironing board. Much of bantering she endured; such</p>
<p>was the fate of every girl who married out of the fancy starch</p>
<p>room. But Saxon was too happy to be hurt by the teasing, a great</p>
<p>deal of which was gross, but all of which was good-natured.</p>
<p>In the steam that arose from under her iron, and on the surfaces</p>
<p>of the dainty lawns and muslins that flew under her hands, she</p>
<p>kept visioning herself in the Pine Street cottage; and steadily</p>
<p>she hummed under her breath her paraphrase of the latest popular</p>
<p>song:</p>
<p>&quot;And when I work, and when I work,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll always work for Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>By three in the afternoon the strain of the piece-workers in the</p>
<p>humid, heated room grew tense. Elderly women gasped and sighed;</p>
<p>the color went out of the cheeks of the young women, their faces</p>
<p>became drawn and dark circles formed under their eyes; but all</p>
<p>held on with weary, unabated speed. The tireless, vigilant</p>
<p>forewoman kept a sharp lookout for incipient hysteria, and once</p>
<p>led a narrow-chested, stoop-shouldered young thing out of the</p>
<p>place in time to prevent a collapse.</p>
<p>Saxon was startled by the wildest scream of terror she had evor</p>
<p>heard. The tense thread of human resolution snapped; wills and</p>
<p>nerves broke down, and a hundred women suspended their irons or</p>
<p>dropped them. It was Mary who had screamed so terribly, and Saxon</p>
<p>saw a strange black animal flapping great claw-like wings and</p>
<p>nestling on Mary&#x27;s shoulder. With the scream, Mary crouched down,</p>
<p>and the strange creature, darting into the air, fluttered full</p>
<p>into the startled face of a woman at the next board. This woman</p>
<p>promptly screamed and fainted. Into the air again, the flying</p>
<p>thing darted hither and thither, while the shrieking, shrinking</p>
<p>women threw up their arms, tried to run away along the aisles, or</p>
<p>cowered under their ironing boards.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s only a bat!&quot; the forewoman shouted. She was furious. &quot;Ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>you ever seen a bat? It won&#x27;t eat you!&quot;</p>
<p>But they were ghetto people, and were not to be quieted. Some</p>
<p>woman who could not see the cause of the uproar, out of her</p>
<p>overwrought apprehension raised the cry of fire and precipitated</p>
<p>the panic rush for the doors. All of them were screaming the</p>
<p>stupid, soul-sickening high note of terror, drowning the</p>
<p>forewoman&#x27;s voice. Saxon had been merely startled at first, but</p>
<p>the screaming panic broke her grip on herself and swept her away.</p>
<p>Though she did not scream, she fled with the rest. When this</p>
<p>horde of crazed women debouched on the next department, Those who</p>
<p>worked there joined in the stampede to escape from they knew not</p>
<p>what danger. In ten minutes the laundry was deserted, save for a</p>
<p>few men wandering about with hand grenades in futile search for</p>
<p>the cause of the disturbance.</p>
<p>The forewoman was stout, but indomitable. Swept along half the</p>
<p>length of an aisle by the terror-stricken women, she had broken</p>
<p>her way back through the rout and quickly caught the</p>
<p>light-blinded visitant in a clothes basket.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe I don&#x27;t know what God looks like, but take it from me I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>seen a tintype of the devil,&quot; Mary gurgled, emotionally</p>
<p>fluttering back and forth between laughter and tears.</p>
<p>But Saxon was angry with herself, for she had been as frightened</p>
<p>as the rest in that wild flight for out-of-doors.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re a lot of fools,&quot; she said. &quot;It was only a bat. I&#x27;ve heard</p>
<p>about them. They live in the country. They wouldn&#x27;t hurt a fly.</p>
<p>They can&#x27;t see in the daytime. That was what was the matter with</p>
<p>this one. It was only a bat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh, you can&#x27;t string me,&quot; Mary replied. &quot;It was the devil.&quot; She</p>
<p>sobbed a moment, and then laughed hysterically again. &quot;Did you</p>
<p>see Mrs. Bergstrom faint? And it only touched her in the face.</p>
<p>Why, it was on my shoulder and touching my bare neck like the</p>
<p>hand of a corpse. And I didn&#x27;t faint.&quot; She laughed again. &quot;I</p>
<p>guess, maybe, I was too scared to faint.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on back,&quot; Saxon urged. &quot;We&#x27;ve lost half an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not me. I&#x27;m goin&#x27; home after that, if they fire me. I couldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>iron for sour apples now, I&#x27;m that shaky.&quot;</p>
<p>One woman had broken a leg, another an arm, and a number nursed</p>
<p>milder bruises and bruises. No bullying nor entreating of the</p>
<p>forewoman could persuade the women to return to work. They were</p>
<p>too upset and nervous, and only here and there could one be found</p>
<p>brave enough to re-enter the bullding for the hats and lunch</p>
<p>baskets of the others. Saxon was one of the handful that returned</p>
<p>and worked till six o&#x27;clock.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Bert!--you&#x27;re squiffed!&quot; Mary cried reproachfully.</p>
<p>The four were at the table in the private room at Barnum&#x27;s. The</p>
<p>wedding supper, simple enough, but seemingly too expensive to</p>
<p>Saxon, had been eaten. Bert, in his hand a glass of California</p>
<p>red wine, which the management supplied for fifty cents a bottle,</p>
<p>was on his feet endeavoring a speech. His face was flushed; his</p>
<p>black eyes wers feverishly bright.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve ben drinkin&#x27; before you met me,&quot; Mary continued. &quot;I can</p>
<p>see it stickin&#x27; out all over you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Consult an oculist, my dear,&quot; he replied. &quot;Bertram is himself</p>
<p>to-night. An&#x27; he is here, arisin&#x27; to his feet to give the glad</p>
<p>hand to his old pal. Bill, old man, here&#x27;s to you. It&#x27;s how-de-do</p>
<p>an&#x27; good-bye, I guess. You&#x27;re a married man now, Bill, an&#x27; you</p>
<p>got to keep regular hours. No more runnin&#x27; around with the boys.</p>
<p>You gotta take care of yourself, an&#x27; get your life insured, an&#x27;</p>
<p>take out an accident policy, an&#x27; join a buildin&#x27; an&#x27; loan</p>
<p>society, an&#x27; a buryin&#x27; association--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now you shut up, Bert,&quot; Mary broke in. &quot;You don&#x27;t talk about</p>
<p>buryin&#x27;s at weddings. You oughta be ashamed of yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa, Mary! Back up! I said what I said because I meant it. I</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t thinkin&#x27; what Mary thinks. What I was thinkin&#x27; ... Let me</p>
<p>tell you what I was thinkin&#x27;. I said buryin&#x27; association, didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>I? Well, it was not with the idea of castin&#x27; gloom over this</p>
<p>merry gatherin&#x27;. Far be it...&quot;</p>
<p>He was so evidently seeking a way out of his predicament, that</p>
<p>Mary tossed her head triumphantly. This acted as a spur to his</p>
<p>reeling wits.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me tell you why,&quot; he went on. &quot;Because, Bill, you got such</p>
<p>an all-fired pretty wife, that&#x27;s why. All the fellows is crazy</p>
<p>over her, an&#x27; when they get to runnin&#x27; after her, what&#x27;ll you be</p>
<p>doin&#x27;? You&#x27;ll be gettin&#x27; busy. And then won&#x27;t you need a buryin&#x27;</p>
<p>association to bury &#x27;em? I just guess yes. That was the</p>
<p>compliment to your good taste in skirts I was tryin&#x27; to come</p>
<p>across with when Mary butted in.&quot;</p>
<p>His glittering eyes rested for a moment in bantering triumph on</p>
<p>Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;Who says I&#x27;m squiffed? Me? Not on your life. I&#x27;m seein&#x27; all</p>
<p>things in a clear white light. An&#x27; I see Bill there, my old</p>
<p>friend Bill. An&#x27; I don&#x27;t see two Bills. I see only one. Bill was</p>
<p>never two-faced in his life. Bill, old man, when I look at you</p>
<p>there in the married harness, I&#x27;m sorry--&quot; He ceased abruptly and</p>
<p>turned on Mary. &quot;Now don&#x27;t go up in the air, old girl. I&#x27;m onto</p>
<p>my job. My grandfather was a state senator, and he could spiel</p>
<p>graceful an&#x27; pleasin&#x27; till the cows come home. So can I.--Bill,</p>
<p>when I look at you, I&#x27;m sorry. I repeat, I&#x27;m sorry. He glared</p>
<p>challengingly at Mary. &quot;For myself when I look at you an&#x27; know</p>
<p>all the happiness you got a hammerlock on. Take it from me,</p>
<p>you&#x27;re a wise guy, bless the women. You&#x27;ve started well. Keep it</p>
<p>up. Marry &#x27;em all, bless &#x27;em. Bill, here&#x27;s to you. You&#x27;re a</p>
<p>Mohegan with a scalplock. An&#x27; you got a squaw that is some squaw,</p>
<p>take it from me. Minnehaha, here&#x27;s to you--to the two of you--an&#x27;</p>
<p>to the papooses, too, gosh-dang them!&quot;</p>
<p>He drained the glass suddenly and collapsed in his chair,</p>
<p>blinking his eyes across at the wedded couple while tears</p>
<p>trickled unheeded down his cheeks. Mary&#x27;s hand went out</p>
<p>soothingly to his, completing his break-down.</p>
<p>&quot;By God, I got a right to cry,&quot; he sobbed. &quot;I&#x27;m losin&#x27; my best</p>
<p>friend, ain&#x27;t I? It&#x27;ll never be the same again never. When I</p>
<p>think of the fun, an&#x27; scrapes, an&#x27; good times Bill an&#x27; me has had</p>
<p>together, I could darn near hate you, Saxon, sittin&#x27; there with</p>
<p>your hand in his.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cheer up, Bert,&quot; she laughed gently. &quot;Look at whose hand you are</p>
<p>holding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, it&#x27;s only one of his cryin&#x27; jags,&quot; Mary said, with a</p>
<p>harshness that her free hand belied as it caressed his hair with</p>
<p>soothing strokes. &quot;Buck up, Bert. Everything&#x27;s all right. And now</p>
<p>it&#x27;s up to Bill to say something after your dandy spiel.&quot;</p>
<p>Bert recovered himself quickly with another glass of wine.</p>
<p>&quot;Kick in, Bill,&quot; he cried. &quot;It&#x27;s your turn now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m no hotair artist,&quot; Billy grumbled. &quot;What&#x27;ll I say, Saxon?</p>
<p>They ain&#x27;t no use tellin&#x27; &#x27;em how happy we are. They know that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell them we&#x27;re always going to he happy,&quot; she said. &quot;And thank</p>
<p>them for all their good wishes, and we both wish them the same.</p>
<p>And we&#x27;re always going to be together, like old times, the four</p>
<p>of us. And tell them they&#x27;re invited down to 507 Pine Street next</p>
<p>Sunday for Sunday dinner.--And, Mary, if you want to come</p>
<p>Saturday night you can sleep in the spare bedroom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve told&#x27;m yourself, better&#x27;n I could.&quot; Billy clapped his</p>
<p>hands. &quot;You did yourself proud, an&#x27; I guess they ain&#x27;t much to</p>
<p>add to it, but just the same I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to pass them a hot one.&quot;</p>
<p>He stood up, his hand on his glass. His clear blue eyes under the</p>
<p>dark brows and framed by the dark lashes, seemed a deeper blue,</p>
<p>and accentuated the blondness of hair and skin. The smooth cheeks</p>
<p>were rosy--not with wine, for it was only his second glass--but</p>
<p>with health and joy. Saxon, looking up at him, thrilled with</p>
<p>pride in him, he was so well-dressed, so strong, so handsome, so</p>
<p>clean-looking--her man-boy. And she was aware of pride in</p>
<p>herself, in her woman&#x27;s desirableness that had won for her so</p>
<p>wonderful a lover.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Bert an&#x27; Mary, here you are at Saxon&#x27;s and my wedding</p>
<p>supper. We&#x27;re just goin&#x27; to take all your good wishes to heart,</p>
<p>we wish you the same back, and when we say it we mean more than</p>
<p>you think we mean. Saxon an&#x27; I believe in tit for tat. So we&#x27;re</p>
<p>wishin&#x27; for the day when the table is turned clear around an&#x27;</p>
<p>we&#x27;re sittin&#x27; as guests at your weddin&#x27; supper. And then, when</p>
<p>you come to Sunday dinner, you can both stop Saturday night in</p>
<p>the spare bedroom. I guess I was wised up when I furnished it,</p>
<p>eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never thought it of you, Billy!&quot; Mary exclaimed. &quot;You&#x27;re every</p>
<p>hit as raw as Bert. But just the same ... &quot;</p>
<p>There was a rush of moisture to her eyes. Her voice faltered and</p>
<p>broke. She smiled through her tears at them, then turned to look</p>
<p>at Bert, who put his arm around her and gathered her on to his</p>
<p>knees.</p>
<p>When they left the restaurant, the four walked to Eighth and</p>
<p>Broadway, where they stopped beside the electric car. Bert and</p>
<p>Billy were awkward and silent, oppressed by a strange aloofness.</p>
<p>But Mary embraced Saxon with fond anxiousness.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right, dear,&quot; Mary whispered. &quot;Don&#x27;t be scared. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>all right. Think of all the other women in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>The conductor clanged the gong, and the two couples separated in</p>
<p>a sudden hubbub of farewell.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you Mohegan!&quot; Bert called after, as the car got under way.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you Minnehaha!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remember what I said,&quot; was Mary&#x27;s parting to Saxon.</p>
<p>The car stopped at Seventh and Pine, the terminus of the line. It</p>
<p>was only a little over two blocks to the cottage. On the front</p>
<p>steps Billy took the key from his pocket.</p>
<p>&quot;Funny, isn&#x27;t it?&quot; he said, as the key turned in tlie lock. &quot;You</p>
<p>an&#x27; me. Just you an&#x27; me.&quot;</p>
<p>While he lighted the lamp in the parlor, Saxon was taking off her</p>
<p>hat. He went into the bedroom and lighted the lamp there, then</p>
<p>turned back and stood in the doorway. Saxon, still unaccountably</p>
<p>fumbling with her hatpins, stole a glance at him. He held out his</p>
<p>arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>She came to him, and in his arms he could feel her trembling.</p>
<p>BOOK II</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>The first evening after the marriage night Saxon met Billy at the</p>
<p>door as he came up the front steps. After their embrace, and as</p>
<p>they crossed the parlor hand in hand toward the kitchen, he</p>
<p>filled his lungs through his nostrils with audible satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;My, but this house smells good, Saxon! It ain&#x27;t the coffee--I</p>
<p>can smell that, too. It&#x27;s the whole house. It smells ... well, it</p>
<p>just smells good to me, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>He washed and dried himself at the sink, while she heated the</p>
<p>frying pan on the front hole of the stove with the lid off. As he</p>
<p>wiped his hands he watched her keenly, and cried out with</p>
<p>approbation as she dropped the steak in the fryin pan.</p>
<p>&quot;Where&#x27;d you learn to cook steak on a dry, hot pan? It&#x27;s the only</p>
<p>way, but darn few women seem to know about it.&quot;</p>
<p>As she took the cover off a second frying pan and stirred the</p>
<p>savory contents with a kitchen knife, he came behind her, passed</p>
<p>his arms under her arm-pits with down-drooping hands upon her</p>
<p>breasts, and bent his head over her shoulder till cheek touched</p>
<p>cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;Um-um-um-m-m! Fried potatoes with onions like mother used to</p>
<p>make. Me for them. Don&#x27;t they smell good, though! Um-um-m-m-m!&quot;</p>
<p>The pressure of his hands relaxed, and his cheek slid caressingly</p>
<p>past hers as he started to release her. Then his hands closed</p>
<p>down again. She felt his lips on her hair and heard his</p>
<p>advertised inhalation of delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Um-um-m-m-m! Don&#x27;t you smell good--yourself, though! I never</p>
<p>understood what they meant when they said a girl was sweet. I</p>
<p>know, now. And you&#x27;re the sweetest I ever knew.&quot;</p>
<p>His joy was boundless. When he returned from combing his hair in</p>
<p>the bedroom and sat down at the small table opposite her, he</p>
<p>paused with knife and fork in hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, bein&#x27; married is a whole lot more than it&#x27;s cracked up to</p>
<p>be by most married folks. Honest to God, Saxon, we can show &#x27;em a</p>
<p>few. We can give &#x27;em cards and spades an&#x27; little casino an&#x27; win</p>
<p>out on big casino and the aces. I&#x27;ve got but one kick comin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>The instant apprehension in her eyes provoked a chuckle from him.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; that is that we didn&#x27;t get married quick enough. Just think.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve lost a whole week of this.&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes shone with gratitude and happiness, and in her heart she</p>
<p>solemnly pledged herself that never in all their married life</p>
<p>would it be otherwise.</p>
<p>Supper finished, she cleared the table and began washing the</p>
<p>dishes at the sink. When he evinced the intention of wiping them,</p>
<p>she caught him by the lapels of the coat and backed him into a</p>
<p>chair.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll sit right there, if you know what&#x27;s good for you. Now be</p>
<p>good and mind what I say. Also, you will smoke a cigarette.--No;</p>
<p>you&#x27;re not going to watch me. There&#x27;s the morning paper beside</p>
<p>you. And if you don&#x27;t hurry to read it, I&#x27;ll be through these</p>
<p>dishes before you&#x27;ve started.&quot;</p>
<p>As he smoked and read, she continually glanced across at him from</p>
<p>her work. One thing more, she thought--slippers; and then the</p>
<p>picture of comfort and content would be complete.</p>
<p>Several minutes later Billy put the paper aside with a sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s no use,&quot; he complained. &quot;I can&#x27;t read.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the matter?&quot; she teased. &quot;Eyes weak?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope. They&#x27;ra sore, and there&#x27;s only one thing to do &#x27;em any</p>
<p>good, an&#x27; that&#x27;s lookin&#x27; at you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, then, baby Billy; I&#x27;ll be through in a jiffy.&quot;</p>
<p>When she had washed the dish towel and scalded out the sink, she</p>
<p>took off her kitchen apron, came to him, and kissed first one eye</p>
<p>and then the other.</p>
<p>&quot;How are they now. Cured?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They feel some better already.&quot;</p>
<p>She repeated the treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;And now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Still better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Almost well.&quot;</p>
<p>After he had adjudged them well, he ouched and informed her that</p>
<p>there was still some hurt in the right eye.</p>
<p>In the course of treating it, she cried out as in pain. Billy was</p>
<p>all alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it? What hurt you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My eyes. They&#x27;re hurting like sixty.&quot;</p>
<p>And Billy became physician for a while and she the patient. When</p>
<p>the cure was accomplished, she led him into the parlor, where, by</p>
<p>the open window, they succeeded in occupying the same Morris</p>
<p>chair. It was the most expensive comfort in the house. It had</p>
<p>cost seven dollars and a half, and, though it was grander than</p>
<p>anything she had dreamed of possessing, the extravagance of it</p>
<p>had worried her in a half-guilty way all day.</p>
<p>The salt chill of the air that is the blessing of all the bay</p>
<p>cities after the sun goes down crept in about them. They heard</p>
<p>the switch engines puffing in the railroad yards, and the</p>
<p>rumbling thunder of the Seventh Street local slowing down in its</p>
<p>run from the Mole to stop at West Oakland station. From the</p>
<p>street came the noise of children playing in the summer night,</p>
<p>and from the steps of the house next door the low voices of</p>
<p>gossiping housewives.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you beat it?&quot; Billy murmured. &quot;When I think of that</p>
<p>six-dollar furnished room of mine, it makes me sick to think what</p>
<p>I was missin&#x27; all the time. But there&#x27;s one satisfaction. If I&#x27;d</p>
<p>changed it sooner I wouldn&#x27;t a-had you. You see, I didn&#x27;t know</p>
<p>you existed only until a couple of weeks ago.&quot;</p>
<p>His hand crept along her bare forearm and up and partly under the</p>
<p>elbow-sleeve.</p>
<p>&quot;Your skin&#x27;s so cool,&quot; he said. &quot;It ain&#x27;t cold; it&#x27;s cool. It</p>
<p>feels good to the hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty soon you&#x27;ll be calling me your cold-storage baby,&quot; she</p>
<p>laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;And your voice is cool,&quot; he went on. &quot;It gives me the feeling</p>
<p>just as your hand does when you rest it on my forehead. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>funny. I can&#x27;t explain it. But your voice just goes all through</p>
<p>me, cool and fine. It&#x27;s like a wind of coolness--just right. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>like the first of the sea-breeze settin&#x27; in in the afternoon</p>
<p>after a scorchin&#x27; hot morning. An&#x27; sometimes, when you talk low,</p>
<p>it sounds round and sweet like the &#x27;cello in the Macdonough</p>
<p>Theater orchestra. And it never goes high up, or sharp, or</p>
<p>squeaky, or scratchy, like some women&#x27;s voices when they&#x27;re mad,</p>
<p>or fresh, or excited, till they remind me of a bum phonograph</p>
<p>record. Why, your voice, it just goes through me till I&#x27;m all</p>
<p>trembling--like with the everlastin&#x27; cool of it. It&#x27;s it&#x27;s</p>
<p>straight delicious. I guess angels in heaven, if they is any,</p>
<p>must have voices like that.&quot;</p>
<p>After a few minutes, in which, so inexpreasible was her happiness</p>
<p>that she could only pass her hand through his hair and cling to</p>
<p>him, he broke out again.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what you remind me of. Did you ever see a</p>
<p>thoroughbred mare, all shinin&#x27; in the sun, with hair like satin</p>
<p>an&#x27; skin so thin an&#x27; tender that the least touch of the whip</p>
<p>leaves a mark--all fine nerves, an&#x27; delicate an&#x27; sensitive,</p>
<p>that&#x27;ll kill the toughest bronco when it comes to endurance an&#x27;</p>
<p>that can strain a tendon in a flash or catch death-of-cold</p>
<p>without a blanket for a night? I wanta tell you they ain&#x27;t many</p>
<p>beautifuler sights in this world. An&#x27; they&#x27;re that fine-strung,</p>
<p>an&#x27; sensitive, an&#x27; delicate. You gotta handle &#x27;em right-side up,</p>
<p>glass, with care. Well, that&#x27;s what you remind me of. And I&#x27;m</p>
<p>goin&#x27; to make it my job to see you get handled an&#x27; gentled in the</p>
<p>same way. You&#x27;re as different from other women as that kind of a</p>
<p>mare is from scrub work-horse mares. You&#x27;re a thoroughbred.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re clean-cut an&#x27; spirited, an&#x27; your lines ...</p>
<p>&quot;Say, d&#x27;ye know you&#x27;ve got some figure? Well, you have. Talk</p>
<p>about Annette Kellerman. You can give her cards and spades. She&#x27;s</p>
<p>Australian, an&#x27; you&#x27;re American, only your figure ain&#x27;t. You&#x27;re</p>
<p>different. You&#x27;re nifty--I don&#x27;t know how to explain it. Other</p>
<p>women ain&#x27;t built like you. You belong in some other country.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re Frenchy, that&#x27;s what. You&#x27;re built like a French woman an&#x27;</p>
<p>more than that--the way you walk, move, stand up or sit down, or</p>
<p>don&#x27;t do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>And he, who had never been out of California, or, for that</p>
<p>matter, had never slept a night away from his birthtown of</p>
<p>Oakland, was right in his judgment. She was a flower of</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon stock, a rarity in the exceptional smallness and</p>
<p>fineness of hand and foot and bone and grace of flesh and</p>
<p>carriage--some throw-back across the face of time to the foraying</p>
<p>Norman-French that had intermingled with the sturdy Saxon breed.</p>
<p>&quot;And in the way you carry your clothes. They belong to you. They</p>
<p>seem just as much part of you as the cool of your voice and skin.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re always all right an&#x27; couldn&#x27;t be better. An&#x27; you know, a</p>
<p>fellow kind of likes to be seen taggin&#x27; around with a woman like</p>
<p>you, that wears her clothes like a dream, an&#x27; hear the other</p>
<p>fellows say: &#x27;Who&#x27;s Bill&#x27;s new skirt? She&#x27;s a peach, ain&#x27;t she?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#x27;t I like to win her, though.&#x27; And all that sort of talk.&quot;</p>
<p>And Saxon, her cheek pressed to his, knew that she was paid in</p>
<p>full for all her midnight sewings and the torturing hours of</p>
<p>drowsy stitching when her head nodded with the weariness of the</p>
<p>day&#x27;s toil, while she recreated for herself filched ideas from</p>
<p>the dainty garments that had steamed under her passing iron.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon, I got a new name for you. You&#x27;re my Tonic Kid.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what you are, the Tonic Kid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you&#x27;ll never get tired of me?&quot; she queried.</p>
<p>&quot;Tired? Why we was made for each other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it wonderful, our meeting, Billy? We might never have met.</p>
<p>It was just by accident that we did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We was born lucky,&quot; he proclaimed. &quot;That&#x27;s a cinch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it was more than luck,&quot; she ventured.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. It just had to be. It was fate. Nothing could a-kept us</p>
<p>apart.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat on in a silence that was quick with unuttered love, till</p>
<p>she felt him slowly draw her more closely and his lips come near</p>
<p>to her ear as they whispered: &quot;What do you say we go to bed?&quot;</p>
<p>Many evenings they spent like this, varied with an occasional</p>
<p>dance, with trips to the Orpheum and to Bell&#x27;s Theater, or to the</p>
<p>moving picture shows, or to the Friday night band concerts in</p>
<p>City Hall Park. Often, on Sunday, she prepared a lunch, and he</p>
<p>drove her out into the hills behind Prince and King, whom Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>employer was still glad to have him exercise.</p>
<p>Each morning Saxon was called by the alarm clock. The first</p>
<p>morning he had insisted upon getting up with her and building the</p>
<p>fire in the kitchen stove. She gave in the first morning, but</p>
<p>after that she laid the fire in the evening, so that all that was</p>
<p>required was the touching of a match to it. And in bed she</p>
<p>compelled him to remain for a last little doze ere she called him</p>
<p>for breakfast. For the first several weeks she prepared his lunch</p>
<p>for him. Then, for a week, he came down to dinner. After that he</p>
<p>was compelled to take his lunch with him. It depended on how far</p>
<p>distant the teaming was done.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re not starting right with a man,&quot; Mary cautioned. &quot;You wait</p>
<p>on him hand and foot. You&#x27;ll spoil him if you don&#x27;t watch out.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s him that ought to be waitin&#x27; on you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s the bread-winner,&quot; Saxon replied. &quot;He works harder than I,</p>
<p>and I&#x27;ve got more time than I know what to do with--time to burn.</p>
<p>Besides, I want to wait on him because I love to, and because ...</p>
<p>well, anyway, I want to.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>Despite the fastidiousness of her housekeeping, Saxon, once she</p>
<p>had systematized it, found time and to spare on her hands.</p>
<p>Especially during the periods in which her husband carried his</p>
<p>lunch and there was no midday meal to prepare, she had a number</p>
<p>of hours each day to herself. Trained for years to the routine of</p>
<p>factory and laundry work, she could not abide this unaccustomed</p>
<p>idleness. She could not bear to sit and do nothing, while she</p>
<p>could not pay calls on her girlhood friends, for they still</p>
<p>worked in factory and laundry. Nor was she acquainted with the</p>
<p>wives of the neighborhood, save for one strange old woman who</p>
<p>lived in the house next door and with whom Saxon had exchanged</p>
<p>snatches of conversation over the backyard division fence.</p>
<p>One time-consuming diversion of which Saxon took advantage was</p>
<p>free and unlimited baths. In the orphan asylum and in Sarah&#x27;s</p>
<p>house she had been used to but one bath a week. As she grew to</p>
<p>womanhood she had attempted more frequent baths. But the effort</p>
<p>proved disastrous, arousing, first, Sarah&#x27;s derision, and next,</p>
<p>her wrath. Sarah had crystallized in the era of the weekly</p>
<p>Saturday night bath, and any increase in this cleansing function</p>
<p>was regarded by her as putting on airs and as an insinuation</p>
<p>against her own cleanliness. Also, it was an extravagant misuse</p>
<p>of fuel, and occasioned extra towels in the family wash. But now,</p>
<p>in Billy&#x27;s house, with her own stove, her own tub and towels and</p>
<p>soap, and no one to say her nay, Saxon was guilty of a daily</p>
<p>orgy. True, it was only a common washtub that she placed on the</p>
<p>kitchen floor and filled by hand; but it was a luxury that had</p>
<p>taken her twenty-four years to achieve. It was from the strange</p>
<p>woman next door that Saxon received a hint, dropped in casual</p>
<p>conversation, of what proved the culminating joy of bathing. A</p>
<p>simple thing--a few drops of druggist&#x27;s ammonia in the water; but</p>
<p>Saxon had never heard of it before.</p>
<p>She was destined to learn much from the strange woman. The</p>
<p>acquaintance had begun one day when Saxon, in the back yard, was</p>
<p>hanging out a couple of corset covers and several pieces of her</p>
<p>finest undergarments. The woman leaning on the rail of her back</p>
<p>porch, had caught her eye, and nodded, as it seemed to Saxon,</p>
<p>half to her and half to the underlinen on the line.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re newly married, aren&#x27;t you?&quot; the woman asked. &quot;I&#x27;m Mrs.</p>
<p>Higgins. I prefer my first name, which is Mercedes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#x27;m Mrs. Roberts,&quot; Saxon replied, thrilling to the newness</p>
<p>of the designation on her tongue. &quot;My first name is Saxon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Strange name for a Yankee woman,&quot; the other commented.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but I&#x27;m not Yankee,&quot; Saxon exclaimed. &quot;I&#x27;m Californian.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;La la,&quot; laughed Mercedes Higgins. &quot;I forgot I was in America. In</p>
<p>other lands all Americans are called Yankees. It is true that you</p>
<p>are newly married?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon nodded with a happy sigh. Mercedes sighed, too.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you happy, soft, beautiful young thing. I could envy you to</p>
<p>hatred--you with all the man-world ripe to be twisted about your</p>
<p>pretty little fingers. And you don&#x27;t realize your fortune. No one</p>
<p>does until it&#x27;s too late.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was puzzled and disturbed, though she answered readily:</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but I do know how lucky I am. I have the finest man in the</p>
<p>world.&quot;</p>
<p>Mercedes Higgins sighed again and changed the subject. She nodded</p>
<p>her head at the garments.</p>
<p>&quot;I see you like pretty things. It is good judgment for a young</p>
<p>woman. They&#x27;re the bait for men--half the weapons in the battle.</p>
<p>They win men, and they hold men--&quot; She broke off to demand almost</p>
<p>fiercely: &quot;And you, you would keep your husband?--always,</p>
<p>always--if you can?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I intend to. I will make him love me always and always.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon ceased, troubled and surprised that she should be so</p>
<p>intimate with a stranger.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tis a queer thing, this love of men,&quot; Mercedes said. &quot;And a</p>
<p>failing of all women is it to believe they know men like books.</p>
<p>And with breaking hearts, die they do, most women, out of their</p>
<p>ignorance of men and still foolishly believing they know all</p>
<p>about them. Oh, la la, the little fools. And so you say, little</p>
<p>new-married woman, that you will make your man love you always</p>
<p>and always? And so they all say it, knowing men and the queerness</p>
<p>of men&#x27;s love the way they think they do. Easier it is to win the</p>
<p>capital prize in the Little Louisiana, but the little new-married</p>
<p>women never know it until too late. But you--you have begun well.</p>
<p>Stay by your pretties and your looks. &#x27;Twas so you won your man,</p>
<p>&#x27;tis so you&#x27;ll hold him. But that is not all. Some time I will</p>
<p>talk with you and tell what few women trouble to know, what few</p>
<p>women ever come to know.--Saxon!--&#x27;tis a strong, handsome name</p>
<p>for a woman. But you don&#x27;t look it. Oh, I&#x27;ve watched you. French</p>
<p>you are, with a Frenchiness beyond dispute. Tell Mr. Roberts I</p>
<p>congratulate him on his good taste.&quot;</p>
<p>She paused, her hand on the knob of her kitchen door.</p>
<p>&quot;And come and see me some time. You will never be sorry. I can</p>
<p>teach you much. Come in the afternoon. My man is night watchman</p>
<p>in the yards and sleeps of mornings. He&#x27;s sleeping now.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon went into the house puzzling and pondering. Anything but</p>
<p>ordinary was this lean, dark-skinned woman, with the face</p>
<p>withered as if scorched in great heats, and the eyes, large and</p>
<p>black, that flashed and flamed with advertisement of an</p>
<p>unquenched inner conflagration. Old she was--Saxon caught herself</p>
<p>debating anywhere between fifty and seventy; and her hair, which</p>
<p>had once been blackest black, was streaked plentifully with gray.</p>
<p>Especially noteworthy to Saxon was her speech. Good English it</p>
<p>was, better than that to which Saxon was accustomed. Yet the</p>
<p>woman was not American. On the other hand, she had no perceptible</p>
<p>accent. Rather were her words touched by a foreignness so elusive</p>
<p>that Saxon could not analyze nor place it.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, huh,&quot; Billy said, when she had told him that evening of the</p>
<p>day&#x27;s event. &quot;So SHE&#x27;S Mrs. Higgins? He&#x27;s a watchman. He&#x27;s got</p>
<p>only one arm. Old Higgins an&#x27; her--a funny bunch, the two of</p>
<p>them. The people&#x27;s scared of her--some of &#x27;em. The Dagoes an&#x27;</p>
<p>some of the old Irish dames thinks she&#x27;s a witch. Won&#x27;t have a</p>
<p>thing to do with her. Bert was tellin&#x27; me about it. Why, Saxon,</p>
<p>d&#x27;ye know, some of &#x27;em believe if she was to get mad at &#x27;em, or</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t like their mugs, or anything, that all she&#x27;s got to do is</p>
<p>look at &#x27;em an&#x27; they&#x27;ll curl up their toes an&#x27; croak. One of the</p>
<p>fellows that works at the stable--you&#x27;ve seen &#x27;m--Henderson--he</p>
<p>lives around the corner on Fifth--he says she&#x27;s bughouse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Saxon defended her new acquaintance. &quot;She may</p>
<p>be crazy, but she says the same thing you&#x27;re always saying. She</p>
<p>says my form is not American but French.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I take my hat off to her,&quot; Billy responded. &quot;No wheels in</p>
<p>her head if she says that. Take it from me, she&#x27;s a wise gazabo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And she speaks good English, Billy, like a school teacher, like</p>
<p>what I guess my mother used to speak. She&#x27;s educated.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She ain&#x27;t no fool, or she wouldn&#x27;t a-sized you up the way she</p>
<p>did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She told me to congratulate you on your good taste in marrying</p>
<p>me,&quot; Saxon laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;She did, eh? Then give her my love. Me for her, because she</p>
<p>knows a good thing when she sees it, an&#x27; she ought to be</p>
<p>congratulating you on your good taste in me.&quot;</p>
<p>It was on another day that Mercedes Higgins nodded, half to</p>
<p>Saxon, and half to the dainty women&#x27;s things Saxon was hanging on</p>
<p>the line.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve been worrying over your washing, little new-wife,&quot; was her</p>
<p>greeting.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but I&#x27;ve worked in the laundry for years,&quot; Saxon said</p>
<p>quickly.</p>
<p>Mercedes sneered scornfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Steam laundry. That&#x27;s business, and it&#x27;s stupid. Only common</p>
<p>things should go to a steam laundry. That is their punishment for</p>
<p>being common. But the pretties! the dainties! the flimsies!--la</p>
<p>la, my dear, their washing is an art. It requires wisdom, genius,</p>
<p>and discretion fine as the clothes are fine. I will give you a</p>
<p>recipe for homemade soap. It will not harden the texture. It will</p>
<p>give whiteness, and softness, and life. You can wear them long,</p>
<p>and fine white clothes are to be loved a long time. Oh, fine</p>
<p>washing is a refinement, an art. It is to be done as an artist</p>
<p>paints a picture, or writes a poem, with love, holily, a true</p>
<p>sacrament of beauty.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall teach you better ways, my dear, better ways than you</p>
<p>Yankees know. I shall teach you new pretties.&quot; She nodded her</p>
<p>head to Saxon&#x27;s underlinen on the line. &quot;I see you make little</p>
<p>laces. I know all laces--the Belgian, the Maltese, the</p>
<p>Mechlin--oh, the many, many loves of laces! I shall teach you</p>
<p>some of the simpler ones so that you can make them for yourself,</p>
<p>for your brave man you are to make love you always and always.&quot;</p>
<p>On her first visit to Mercedes Higgins, Saxon received the recipe</p>
<p>for home-made soap and her head was filled with a minutiae of</p>
<p>instruction in the art of fine washing. Further, she was</p>
<p>fascinated and excited by all the newness and strangeness of the</p>
<p>withered old woman who blew upon her the breath of wider lands</p>
<p>and seas beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>&quot;You are Spanish?&quot; Saxon ventnred.</p>
<p>&quot;No, and yes, and neither, and more. My father was Irish, my</p>
<p>mother Peruvian-Spanish. &#x27;Tis after her I took, in color and</p>
<p>looks. In other ways after my father, the blue-eyed Celt with the</p>
<p>fairy song on his tongue and the restless feet that stole the</p>
<p>rest of him away to far-wandering. And the feet of him that he</p>
<p>lent me have led me away on as wide far roads as ever his led</p>
<p>him.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon remembered her school geography, and with her mind&#x27;s eye</p>
<p>she saw a certain outline map of a continent with jiggly wavering</p>
<p>parallel lines that denoted coast.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she cried, &quot;then you are South American.&quot;</p>
<p>Mercedes shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;I had to be born somewhere. It was a great ranch, my mother&#x27;s.</p>
<p>You could put all Oakland in one of its smallest pastures.&quot;</p>
<p>Mercedes Higgins sighed cheerfully and for the time was lost in</p>
<p>retrospection. Saxon was curious to hear more about this woman</p>
<p>who must have lived much as the Spanish-Californians had lived in</p>
<p>the old days.</p>
<p>&quot;You received a good education,&quot; she said tentatively. &quot;Your</p>
<p>English is perfect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, the English came afterward, and not in school. But, as it</p>
<p>goes, yes, a good education in all things but the most</p>
<p>important--men. That, too, came afterward. And little my mother</p>
<p>dreamed--she was a grand lady, what you call a</p>
<p>cattle-queen--little she dreamed my fine education was to fit me</p>
<p>in the end for a night watchman&#x27;s wife.&quot; She laughed genuinely at</p>
<p>the grotesqueness of the idea. &quot;Night watchman, laborers, why, we</p>
<p>had hundreds, yes, thousands that toiled for us. The peons--they</p>
<p>are like what you call slaves, almost, and the cowboys, who could</p>
<p>ride two hundred miles between side and side of the ranch. And in</p>
<p>the big house servants beyond remembering or counting. La la, in</p>
<p>my mother&#x27;s house were many servants.&quot;</p>
<p>Mercedes Higgins was voluble as a Greek, and wandered on in</p>
<p>reminiscence.</p>
<p>&quot;But our servants were lazy and dirty. The Chinese are the</p>
<p>servants par excellence. So are the Japanese, when you find a</p>
<p>good one, but not so good as the Chinese. The Japanese</p>
<p>maidservants are pretty and merry, but you never know the moment</p>
<p>they&#x27;ll leave you. The Hindoos are not strong, but very obedient.</p>
<p>They look upon sahibs and memsahibs as gods! I was a</p>
<p>memsahib--which means woman. I once had a Russian cook who always</p>
<p>spat in the soup for luck. It was very funny. But we put up with</p>
<p>it. It was the custom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How you must have traveled to have such strange servants!&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>encouraged.</p>
<p>The old woman laughed corroboration.</p>
<p>&quot;And the strangest of all, down in the South Seas, black slaves,</p>
<p>little kinky-haired cannibals with bones through their noses.</p>
<p>When they did not mind, or when they stole, they were tied up to</p>
<p>a cocoanut palm behind the compound and lashed with whips of</p>
<p>rhinoceros hide. They were from an island of cannibals and</p>
<p>head-hunters, and they never cried out. It was their pride. There</p>
<p>was little Vibi, only twelve years old--he waited on me--and when</p>
<p>his back was cut in shreds and I wept over him, he would only</p>
<p>laugh and say, &#x27;Short time little bit I take &#x27;m head belong big</p>
<p>fella white marster.&#x27; That was Bruce Anstey, the Englishman who</p>
<p>whipped him. But little Vibi never got the head. He ran away and</p>
<p>the bushmen cut off his own head and ate every bit of him.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon chilled, and her face was grave; but Mercedes Higgins</p>
<p>rattled on.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, those were wild, gay, savage days. Would you believe it, my</p>
<p>dear, in three years those Englishmen of the plantation drank up</p>
<p>oceans of champagne and Scotch whisky and dropped thirty thousand</p>
<p>pounds on the adventure. Not dollars--pounds, which means one</p>
<p>hundred and fifty thousand dollars. They were princes while it</p>
<p>lasted. It was splendid, glorious. It was mad, mad. I sold half</p>
<p>my beautiful jewels in New Zealand before I got started again.</p>
<p>Bruce Anstey blew out his brains at the end. Roger went mate on a</p>
<p>trader with a black crew, for eight pounds a month. And Jack</p>
<p>Gilbraith--he was the rarest of them all. His people were wealthy</p>
<p>and titled, and he went home to England and sold cat&#x27;s meat, sat</p>
<p>around their big house till they gave him more money to start a</p>
<p>rubber plantation in the East Indies somewhere, on Sumatra, I</p>
<p>think--or was it New Guinea?&quot;</p>
<p>And Saxon, back in her own kitchen and preparing supper for</p>
<p>Billy, wondered what lusts and rapacities had led the old,</p>
<p>burnt-faced woman from the big Peruvian ranch, through all the</p>
<p>world, to West Oakland and Barry Higgins Old Barry was not the</p>
<p>sort who would fling away his share of one hundred and fifty</p>
<p>thousand dollars, much less ever attain to such opulence.</p>
<p>Besides, she had mentioned the names of other men, but not his.</p>
<p>Much more Mercedes had talked, in snatches and fragments. There</p>
<p>seemed no great country nor city of the old world or the new in</p>
<p>which she had not been. She had even been in Klondike, ten years</p>
<p>before, in a half-dozen flashing sentences picturing the</p>
<p>fur-clad, be-moccasined miners sowing the barroom floors with</p>
<p>thousands of dollars&#x27; worth of gold dust. Always, so it seemed to</p>
<p>Saxon, Mrs. Higgins had been with men to whom money was as water.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>Saxon, brooding over her problem of retaining Billy&#x27;s love, of</p>
<p>never staling the freshness of their feeling for each other and</p>
<p>of never descending from the heights which at present they were</p>
<p>treading, felt herself impelled toward Mrs. Higgins. SHE knew;</p>
<p>surely she must know. Had she not hinted knowledge beyond</p>
<p>ordinary women&#x27;s knowledge?</p>
<p>Several weeks went by, during which Saxon was often with her. But</p>
<p>Mrs. Higgins talked of all other matters, taught Saxon the making</p>
<p>of certain simple laces, and instructed her in the arts of</p>
<p>washing and of marketing. And then, one afternoon, Saxon found</p>
<p>Mrs. Higgins more voluble than usual, with words, clean-uttered,</p>
<p>that rippled and tripped in their haste to escape. Her eyes were</p>
<p>flaming. So flamed her face. Her words were flames. There was a</p>
<p>smell of liquor in the air and Saxon knew that the old woman had</p>
<p>been drinking. Nervous and frightened, at the same time</p>
<p>fascinated, Saxon hemstitched a linen handkerchief intended for</p>
<p>Billy and listened to Mercedes&#x27; wild flow of speech.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, my dear. I shall tell you about the world of men. Do not</p>
<p>be stupid like all your people, who think me foolish and a witch</p>
<p>with the evil eye. Ha! ha! When I think of silly Maggie Donahue</p>
<p>pulling the shawl across her baby&#x27;s face when we pass each other</p>
<p>on the sidewalk! A witch I have been, &#x27;tis true, but my witchery</p>
<p>was with men. Oh, I am wise, very wise, my dear. I shall tell you</p>
<p>of women&#x27;s ways with men, and of men&#x27;s ways with women, the best</p>
<p>of them and the worst of them. Of the brute that is in all men,</p>
<p>of the queerness of them that breaks the hearts of stupid women</p>
<p>who do not understand. And all women are stupid. I am not stupid.</p>
<p>La la, listen.</p>
<p>&quot;I am an old woman. And like a woman, I&#x27;ll not tell you how old I</p>
<p>am. Yet can I hold men. Yet would I hold men, toothless and a</p>
<p>hundred, my nose touching my chin. Not the young men. They were</p>
<p>mine in my young days. But the old men, as befits my years. And</p>
<p>well for me the power is mine. In all this world I am without kin</p>
<p>or cash. Only have I wisdom and memories--memories that are</p>
<p>ashes, but royal ashes, jeweled ashes. Old women, such as I,</p>
<p>starve and shiver, or accept the pauper&#x27;s dole and the pauper&#x27;s</p>
<p>shroud. Not I. I hold my man. True, &#x27;tis only Barry Higgins--old</p>
<p>Barry, heavy, an ox, but a male man, my dear, and queer as all</p>
<p>men are queer. &#x27;Tis true, he has one arm.&quot; She shrugged her</p>
<p>shoulders. &quot;A compensation. He cannot beat me, and old bones are</p>
<p>tender when the round flesh thins to strings.</p>
<p>&quot;But when I think of my wild young lovers, princes, mad with the</p>
<p>madness of youth! I have lived. It is enough. I regret nothing.</p>
<p>And with old Barry I have my surety of a bite to eat and a place</p>
<p>by the fire. And why? Because I know men, and shall never lose my</p>
<p>cunning to hold them. &#x27;Tis bitter sweet, the knowledge of them,</p>
<p>more sweet than bitter--men and men and men! Not stupid dolts,</p>
<p>nor fat bourgeois swine of business men, but men of temperament,</p>
<p>of flame and fire; madmen, maybe, but a lawless, royal race of</p>
<p>madmen.</p>
<p>&quot;Little wife-woman, you must learn. Variety! There lies the</p>
<p>magic. &#x27;Tis the golden key. &#x27;Tis the toy that amuses. Without it</p>
<p>in the wife, the man is a Turk; with it, he is her slave, and</p>
<p>faithful. A wife must be many wives. If you would have your</p>
<p>husband&#x27;s love you must be all women to him. You must be ever</p>
<p>new, with the dew of newness ever sparkling, a flower that never</p>
<p>blooms to the fulness that fades. You must be a garden of</p>
<p>flowers, ever new, ever fresh, ever different. And in your garden</p>
<p>the man must never pluck the last of your posies.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, little wife-woman. In the garden of love is a snake. It</p>
<p>is the commonplace. Stamp on its head, or it will destroy the</p>
<p>garden. Remember the name. Commonplace. Never be too intimate.</p>
<p>Men only seem gross. Women are more gross than men.--No, do not</p>
<p>argue, little new-wife. You are an infant woman. Women are less</p>
<p>delicate than men. Do I not know? Of their own husbands they will</p>
<p>relate the most intimate love-secrets to other women. Men never</p>
<p>do this of their wives. Explain it. There is only one way. In all</p>
<p>things of love women are less delicate. It is their mistake. It</p>
<p>is the father and the mother of the commonplace, and it is the</p>
<p>commonplace, like a loathsome slug, that beslimes and destroys</p>
<p>love.</p>
<p>&quot;Be delicate, little wife-woman. Never be without your veil,</p>
<p>without many veils. Veil yourself in a thousand veils, all</p>
<p>shimmering and glittering with costly textures and precious</p>
<p>jewels. Never let the last veil be drawn. Against the morrow</p>
<p>array yourself with more veils, ever more veils, veils without</p>
<p>end. Yet the many veils must not seem many. Each veil must seem</p>
<p>the only one between you and your hungry lover who will have</p>
<p>nothing less than all of you. Each time he must seem to get all,</p>
<p>to tear aside the last veil that hides you. He must think so. It</p>
<p>must not be so. Then there will be no satiety, for on the morrow</p>
<p>he will find another last veil that has escaped him.</p>
<p>&quot;Remember, each veil must seem the last and only one. Always you</p>
<p>must seem to abandon all to his arms; always you must reserve</p>
<p>more that on the morrow and on all the morrows you may abandon.</p>
<p>Of such is variety, surprise, so that your man&#x27;s pursuit will be</p>
<p>everlasting, so that his eyes will look to you for newness, and</p>
<p>not to other women. It was the freshness and the newness&#x27; of your</p>
<p>beauty and you, the mystery of you, that won your man. When a man</p>
<p>has plucked and smelled all the sweetness of a flower, he looks</p>
<p>for other flowers. It is his queerness. You must ever remain a</p>
<p>flower almost plucked yet never plucked, stored with vats of</p>
<p>sweet unbroached though ever broached.</p>
<p>&quot;Stupid women, and all are stupid, think the first winning of the</p>
<p>man the final victory. Then they settle down and grow fat, and</p>
<p>state, and dead, and heartbroken. Alas, they are so stupid. But</p>
<p>you, little infant-woman with your first victory, you must make</p>
<p>your love-life an unending chain of victories. Each day you must</p>
<p>win your man again. And when you have won the last victory, when</p>
<p>you can find no more to win, then ends love. Finis is written,</p>
<p>and your man wanders in strange gardens. Remember, love must be</p>
<p>kept insatiable. It must have an appetite knife-edged and never</p>
<p>satisfied. You must feed your lover well, ah, very well, most</p>
<p>well; give, give, yet send him away hungry to come back to you</p>
<p>for more.</p>
<p>Mrs. Higgins stood up suddenly and crossed out of the room. Saxon</p>
<p>had not failed to note the litheness and grace in that lean and</p>
<p>withered body. She watched for Mrs. Higgins&#x27; return, and knew</p>
<p>that the litheness and grace had not been imagined.</p>
<p>&quot;Scarcely have I told you the first letter in love&#x27;s alphabet,&quot;</p>
<p>said Mercedes Higgins, as she reseated herself.</p>
<p>In her hands was a tiny instrument, beautifully grained and</p>
<p>richly brown, which resembled a guitar save that it bore four</p>
<p>strings. She swept them back and forth with rhythmic forefinger</p>
<p>and lifted a voice, thin and mellow, in a fashion of melody that</p>
<p>was strange, and in a foreign tongue, warm-voweled, all-voweled,</p>
<p>and love-exciting. Softly throbbing, voice and strings arose on</p>
<p>sensuous crests of song, died away to whisperings and caresses,</p>
<p>drifted through love-dusks and twilights, or swelled again to</p>
<p>love-cries barbarically imperious in which were woven plaintive</p>
<p>calls and madnesses of invitation and promise. It went through</p>
<p>Saxon until she was as this instrument, swept with passional</p>
<p>strains. It seemed to her a dream, and almost was she dizzy, when</p>
<p>Mercedes Higgins ceased.</p>
<p>&quot;If your man had clasped the last of you, and if all of you were</p>
<p>known to him as an old story, yet, did you sing that one song, as</p>
<p>I have sung it, yet would his arms again go out to you and his</p>
<p>eyes grow warm with the old mad lights. Do you see? Do you</p>
<p>understand, little wife-woman?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon could only nod, her lips too dry for speech.</p>
<p>&quot;The golden koa, the king of woods,&quot; Mercedes was crooning over</p>
<p>the instrument. &quot;The ukulele--that is what the Hawaiians call it,</p>
<p>which means, my dear, the jumping flea. They are golden-fleshed,</p>
<p>the Hawalians, a race of lovers, all in the warm cool of the</p>
<p>tropic night where the trade winds blow.&quot;</p>
<p>Again she struck the strings. She sang in another language, which</p>
<p>Saxon deemed must be French. It was a gayly-devilish lilt,</p>
<p>tripping and tickling. Her large eyes at times grew larger and</p>
<p>wilder, and again narrowed in enticement and wickedness. When she</p>
<p>ended, she looked to Saxon for a verdict.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t like that one so well,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>Mercedes shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;They all have their worth, little infant-woman with so much to</p>
<p>learn. There are times when men may be won with wine. There are</p>
<p>times when men may be won with the wine of song, so queer they</p>
<p>are. La la, so many ways, so many ways. There are your pretties,</p>
<p>my dear, your dainties. They are magic nets. No fisherman upon</p>
<p>the sea ever tangled fish more successfully than we women with</p>
<p>our flimsies. You are on the right path. I have seen men enmeshed</p>
<p>by a corset cover no prettier, no daintier, than these of yours I</p>
<p>have seen on the line.</p>
<p>&quot;I have called the washing of fine linen an art. But it is not</p>
<p>for itself alone. The greatest of the arts is the conquering of</p>
<p>men. Love is the sum of all the arts, as it is the reason for</p>
<p>their existence. Listen. In all times and ages have been women,</p>
<p>great wise women. They did not need to be beautiful. Greater then</p>
<p>all woman&#x27;s beauty was their wisdom. Princes end potentates bowed</p>
<p>down before them. Nations battled over them. Empires crashed</p>
<p>because of them. Religions were founded on them. Aphrodite,</p>
<p>Astarte, the worships of the night--listen, infant-woman, of the</p>
<p>great women who conquered worlds of men.&quot;</p>
<p>And thereafter Saxon listened, in a maze, to what almost seemed a</p>
<p>wild farrago, save that the strange meaningless phrases were</p>
<p>fraught with dim, mysterious significance. She caught glimmerings</p>
<p>of profounds inexpressible and unthinkable that hinted</p>
<p>connotations lawless and terrible. The woman&#x27;s speech was a lava</p>
<p>rush, scorching and searing; and Saxon&#x27;s cheeks, and forehead,</p>
<p>and neck burned with a blush that continuously increased. She</p>
<p>trembled with fear, suffered qualms of nausea, thought sometimes</p>
<p>that she would faint, so madly reeled her brain; yet she could</p>
<p>not tear herself away, sad sat on and on, her sewing forgotten on</p>
<p>her lap, staring with inward sight upon a nightmare vision beyond</p>
<p>all imagining. At last, when it seemed she could endure no more,</p>
<p>and while she was wetting her dry lips to cry out in protest,</p>
<p>Mercedes ceased.</p>
<p>&quot;And here endeth the first lesson,&quot; she said quite calmly, then</p>
<p>laughed with a laughter that was tantalizing and tormenting.</p>
<p>&quot;What is the matter? You are not shocked?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am frightened,&quot; Saxon quavered huskily, with a half-sob of</p>
<p>nervousness. &quot;You frighten me. I am very foolish, and I know so</p>
<p>little, that I had never dreamed ... THAT.&quot;</p>
<p>Mercedes nodded her head comprehendingly.</p>
<p>&quot;It is indeed to be frightened at,&quot; she said. &quot;It is solemn; it</p>
<p>is terrible; it is magnificent!&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>Saxon had been clear-eyed all her days, though her field of</p>
<p>vision had been restricted. Clear-eyed, from her childhood days</p>
<p>with the saloonkeeper Cady and Cady&#x27;s good-natured but unmoral</p>
<p>spouse, she had observed, and, later, generalized much upon sex.</p>
<p>She knew the post-nuptial problem of retaining a husband&#x27;s love,</p>
<p>as few wives of any class knew it, just as she knew the</p>
<p>pre-nuptial problem of selecting a husband, as few girls of the</p>
<p>working class knew it.</p>
<p>She had of herself developed an eminently rational philosophy of</p>
<p>love. Instinctively, and consciously, too, she had made toward</p>
<p>delicacy, and shunned the perils of the habitual and commonplace.</p>
<p>Thoroughly aware she was that as she cheapened herself so did she</p>
<p>cheapen love. Never, in the weeks of their married life, had</p>
<p>Billy found her dowdy, or harshly irritable, or lethargic. And</p>
<p>she had deliberately permeated her house with her personal</p>
<p>atmosphere of coolness, and freshness, and equableness. Nor had</p>
<p>she been ignorant of such assets as surprise and charm. Her</p>
<p>imagination had not been asleep, and she had been born with</p>
<p>wisdom. In Billy she had won a prize, and she knew it. She</p>
<p>appreciated his lover&#x27;s ardor and was proud. His open-handed</p>
<p>liberality, his desire for everything of the best, his own</p>
<p>personal cleanliness and care of himself she recognized as far</p>
<p>beyond the average. He was never coarse. He met delicacy with</p>
<p>delicacy, though it was obvious to her that the initiative in all</p>
<p>such matters lay with her and must lie with her always. He was</p>
<p>largely unconscious of what he did and why. But she knew in all</p>
<p>full clarity of judgment. And he was such a prize among men.</p>
<p>Despite her clear sight of her problem of keeping Billy a lover,</p>
<p>and despite the considerable knowledge and experience arrayed</p>
<p>before her mental vision, Mercedes Higgins had spread before her</p>
<p>a vastly wider panorama. The old woman had verified her own</p>
<p>conclusions, given her new ideas, clinched old ones, and even</p>
<p>savagely emphasized the tragic importance of the whole problem.</p>
<p>Much Saxon remembered of that mad preachment, much she guessed</p>
<p>and felt, and much had been beyond her experience and</p>
<p>understanding. But the metaphors of the veils and the flowers,</p>
<p>and the rules of giving to abandonment with always more to</p>
<p>abandon, she grasped thoroughly, and she was enabled to formulate</p>
<p>a bigger and stronger love-philosophy. In the light of the</p>
<p>revelation she re-examined the married lives of all she had ever</p>
<p>known, and, with sharp definiteness as never before, she saw</p>
<p>where and why so many of them had failed.</p>
<p>With renewed ardor Saxon devoted herself to her household, to her</p>
<p>pretties, and to her charms. She marketed with a keener desire</p>
<p>for the best, though never ignoring the need for economy. From</p>
<p>the women&#x27;s pages of the Sunday supplements, and from the women&#x27;s</p>
<p>magazines in the free reading room two blocks away, she gleaned</p>
<p>many idess for the preservation of her looks. In a systematic way</p>
<p>she exercised the various parts of her body, and a certain period</p>
<p>of time each day she employed in facial exercises and massage for</p>
<p>the purpose of retaining the roundness and freshness, and</p>
<p>firmness and color. Billy did not know. These intimacies of the</p>
<p>toilette were not for him. The results, only, were his. She drew</p>
<p>books from the Carnegie Library and studied physiology and</p>
<p>hygiene, and learned a myriad of things about herself and the</p>
<p>ways of woman&#x27;s health that she had never been taught by Sarah,</p>
<p>the women of the orphan asylum, nor by Mrs. Cady.</p>
<p>After long debate she subscribed to a woman&#x27;s magazine, the</p>
<p>patterns and lessons of which she decided were the best suited to</p>
<p>her taste and purse. The other woman&#x27;s magazines she had aceess</p>
<p>to in the free reading room, and more than one pattern of lace</p>
<p>and embroidery she copied by means of tracing paper. Before the</p>
<p>lingerie windows of the uptown shops she often stood and studied;</p>
<p>nor was she above taking advantage, when small purchases were</p>
<p>made, of looking over the goods at the hand-embroidered underwear</p>
<p>counters. Once, she even considered taking up with hand-painted</p>
<p>china, but gave over the idea when she learned its expensiveness.</p>
<p>She slowly replaced all her simple maiden underlinen with</p>
<p>garments which, while still simple, were wrought with beautiful</p>
<p>French embroidery, tucks, and drawnwork. She crocheted fine</p>
<p>edgings on the inexpensive knitted underwear she wore in winter.</p>
<p>She made little corset covers and chemises of fine but fairly</p>
<p>inexpensive lawns, and, with simple flowered designs and perfect</p>
<p>laundering, her nightgowns were always sweetly fresh and dainty.</p>
<p>In some publication she ran across a brief printed note to the</p>
<p>effect that French women were just beginning to wear fascinating</p>
<p>beruffled caps at the breakfast table. It meant nothing to her</p>
<p>that in her case she must first prepare the breakfast. Promptly</p>
<p>appeared in the house a yard of dotted Swiss muslin, and Saxon</p>
<p>was deep in experimenting on patterns for herself, and in sorting</p>
<p>her bits of laces for suitable trimmings. The resultant dainty</p>
<p>creation won Mercedes Higgins&#x27; enthusiastic approval.</p>
<p>Saxon made for herself simple house slips of pretty gingham, with</p>
<p>neat low collars turned back from her fresh round throat. She</p>
<p>crocheted yards of laces for her underwear, and made Battenberg</p>
<p>in abundance for her table and for the bureau. A great</p>
<p>achievement, that aroused Billy&#x27;s applause, was an Afghan for the</p>
<p>bed. She even ventured a rag carpet, which, the women&#x27;s magazines</p>
<p>informed her, had newly returned into fashion. As a matter of</p>
<p>course she hemstitched the best table linen and bed linen they</p>
<p>could afford.</p>
<p>As the happy months went by she was never idle. Nor was Billy</p>
<p>forgotten. When the cold weather came on she knitted him</p>
<p>wristlets, which he always religiously wore from the house and</p>
<p>pocketed immediately thereafter. The two sweaters she made for</p>
<p>him, however, received a better fate, as did the slippers which</p>
<p>she insisted on his slipping into, on the evenings they remained</p>
<p>at home.</p>
<p>The hard practical wisdom of Mercedes Higgins proved of immense</p>
<p>help, for Saxon strove with a fervor almost religious to have</p>
<p>everything of the best and at the same time to be saving. Here</p>
<p>she faced the financial and economic problem of keeping house in</p>
<p>a society where the cost of living rose faster than the wages of</p>
<p>industry. And here the old woman taught her the science of</p>
<p>marketing so thoroughly that she made a dollar of Billy&#x27;s go half</p>
<p>as far again as the wives of the neighborhood made the dollars of</p>
<p>their men go.</p>
<p>Invariably, on Saturday night, Billy poured his total wages into</p>
<p>her lap. He never asked for an accounting of what she did with</p>
<p>it, though he continually reiterated that he had never fed so</p>
<p>well in his life. And always, the wages still untouched in her</p>
<p>lap, she had him take out what he estimated he would need for</p>
<p>spending money for the week to come. Not only did she bid him</p>
<p>take plenty but she insisted on his taking any amount extra that</p>
<p>he might desire at any time through the week. And, further, she</p>
<p>insisted he should not tell her what it was for.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve always had money in your pocket,&quot; she reminded him, &quot;and</p>
<p>there&#x27;s no reason marriage should change that. If it did, I&#x27;d</p>
<p>wish I&#x27;d never married you. Oh, I know about men when they get</p>
<p>together. First one treats and then another, and it takes money.</p>
<p>Now if you can&#x27;t treat just as freely as the rest of thcm, why I</p>
<p>know you so well that I know you&#x27;d stay away from them. And that</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t be right ... to you, I mean. I want you to be together</p>
<p>with men. It&#x27;s good for a man.&quot;</p>
<p>And Billy buried her in his arms and swore she was the greatest</p>
<p>little bit of woman that ever came down the pike.</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; he jubilated; &quot;not only do I feed better, and live more</p>
<p>comfortable, and hold up my end with the fellows; but I&#x27;m</p>
<p>actually saving money--or you are for me. Here I am, with</p>
<p>furniture being paid for regular every month, and a little woman</p>
<p>I&#x27;m mad over, and on top of it money in the bank. How much is it</p>
<p>now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sixty-two dollars,&quot; she told him. &quot;Not so bad for a rainy day.</p>
<p>You might get sick, or hurt, or something happen.</p>
<p>It was in mid-winter, when Billy, with quite a deal of obvious</p>
<p>reluctance, broached a money matter to Saxon. His old friend,</p>
<p>Billy Murphy, was laid up with la grippe, and one of his</p>
<p>children, playing in the street, had been seriously injured by a</p>
<p>passing wagon. Billy Murphy, still feeble after two weeks in bed,</p>
<p>had asked Billy for the loan of fifty dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s perfectly safe,&quot; Billy concluded to Saxon. &quot;I&#x27;ve known him</p>
<p>since we was kids at the Durant School together. He&#x27;s straight as</p>
<p>a die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s got nothing to do with it,&quot; Saxon chided. &quot;If you were</p>
<p>single you&#x27;d have lent it to him immediately, wouldn&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Then it&#x27;s no different because you&#x27;re married. It&#x27;s your money,</p>
<p>Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not by a damn sight,&quot; he cried. &quot;It ain&#x27;t mine. It&#x27;s ourn. And I</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t think of lettin&#x27; anybody have it without seein&#x27; you</p>
<p>first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you didn&#x27;t tell him that,&quot; she ssid with quick concern.</p>
<p>&quot;Nope,&quot; Billy laughed. &quot;I knew, if I did, you&#x27;d be madder&#x27;n a</p>
<p>hatter. I just told him I&#x27;d try an&#x27; figure it out. After all, I</p>
<p>was sure you&#x27;d stand for it if you had it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Billy,&quot; she murmured, her voice rich and low with love;</p>
<p>&quot;maybe you don&#x27;t know it, but that&#x27;s one of the sweetest things</p>
<p>you&#x27;ve said since we got married.&quot;</p>
<p>The more Saxon saw of Mercedes Higgins the less did she</p>
<p>understand her. That the old woman was a close-fisted miser,</p>
<p>Saxon soon learned. And this trait she found hard to reconcile</p>
<p>with her tales of squandering. On the other hand, Saxon was</p>
<p>bewildered by Mercedes&#x27; extravagance in personal matters. Her</p>
<p>underlinen, hand-made of course, was very costly. The table she</p>
<p>set for Barry was good, but the table for herself was vastly</p>
<p>better. Yet both tables were set on the same table. While Barry</p>
<p>contented himaelf with solid round steak, Mercedes ate</p>
<p>tenderloin. A huge, tough muttonchop on Barry&#x27;s plate would be</p>
<p>balanced by tiny French chops on Mercedes&#x27; plate. Tea was brewed</p>
<p>in separate pots. So was coffee. While Barry gulped twenty-five</p>
<p>cent tea from a large and heavy mug, Mercedes sipped three-dollar</p>
<p>tea from a tiny cup of Belleek, rose-tinted, fragile as all</p>
<p>egg-shell. In the same manner, his twenty-five cent coffee was</p>
<p>diluted with milk, her eighty cent Turkish with cream.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tis good enough for the old man,&quot; she told Saxon. &quot;He knows no</p>
<p>better, and it would be a wicked sin to waste it on him.&quot;</p>
<p>Little traffickings began between the two women. After Mercedes</p>
<p>had freely taught Saxon the loose-wristed facility of playing</p>
<p>accompaniments on the ukulele, she proposed an exchange. Her time</p>
<p>was past, she said, for such frivolities, and she offered the</p>
<p>instrument for the breakfast cap of which Saxon had made so good</p>
<p>a success.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s worth a few dollars,&quot; Mercedes said. &quot;It cost me twenty,</p>
<p>though that was years ago. Yet it is well worth the value of the</p>
<p>cap.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But wouldn&#x27;t the cap be frivolous, too?&quot; Saxon queried, though</p>
<p>herself well pleased with the bargain.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tis not for my graying hair,&quot; Mercedes frankly disclaimed. &quot;I</p>
<p>shall sell it for the money. Much that I do, when the rheumatism</p>
<p>is not maddening my fingers, I sell. La la, my dear, &#x27;tis not old</p>
<p>Barry&#x27;s fifty a month that&#x27;ll satisfy all my expensive tastes.</p>
<p>&#x27;Tis I that make up the difference. And old age needs money as</p>
<p>never youth needs it. Some day you will learn for yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am well satisfied with the trade,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;And I shall</p>
<p>make me another cap when I can lay aside enough for the</p>
<p>material.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Make several,&quot; Mercedes advised. &quot;I&#x27;ll sell them for you,</p>
<p>keeping, of course, a small commission for my services. I can</p>
<p>give you six dollars apiece for them. We will consult about them.</p>
<p>The profit will more than provide material for your own.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>Four eventful things happened in the course of the winter. Bert</p>
<p>and Mary got married and rented a cottage in the neighborhood</p>
<p>three blocks away. Billy&#x27;s wages were cut, along with the wages</p>
<p>of all the teamsters in Oakland. Billy took up shaving with a</p>
<p>safety razor. And, finally, Saxon was proven a false prophet and</p>
<p>Sarah a true one.</p>
<p>Saxon made up her mind, beyond any doubt, ere she confided the</p>
<p>news to Billy. At first, while still suspecting, she had felt a</p>
<p>frightened sinking of the heart and fear of the unknown and</p>
<p>unexperienced. Then had come economic fear, as she contemplated</p>
<p>the increased expense entailed. But by the time she had made</p>
<p>surety doubly sure, all was swept away before a wave of</p>
<p>passionate gladness. HERS AND BILLY&#x27;S! The phrase was continually</p>
<p>in her mind, and each recurrent thought of it brought an actual</p>
<p>physical pleasure-pang to her heart.</p>
<p>The night she told the news to Billy, he withheld his own news of</p>
<p>the wage-cut, and joined with her in welcoming the little one.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;ll we do? Go to the theater to celebrate?&quot; he asked,</p>
<p>relaxing the pressure of his embrace so that she might speak. &quot;Or</p>
<p>suppose we stay in, just you and me, and ... and the three of</p>
<p>us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay in,&quot; was her verdict. &quot;I just want you to hold me, and hold</p>
<p>me, and hold me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s what I wanted, too, only I wasn&#x27;t sure, after bein&#x27; in</p>
<p>the house all day, maybe you&#x27;d want to go out.&quot;</p>
<p>There was frost in the air, and Billy brought the Morris chair in</p>
<p>by the kitchen stove. She lay cuddled in his arms, her head on</p>
<p>his shoulder, his cheek against her hair.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn&#x27;t make no mistake in our lightning marriage with only a</p>
<p>week&#x27;s courtin&#x27;,&quot; he reflected aloud. &quot;Why, Saxon, we&#x27;ve been</p>
<p>courtin&#x27; ever since just the same. And now . . . my God, Saxon,</p>
<p>it&#x27;s too wonderful to be true. Think of it! Ourn! The three of</p>
<p>us! The little rascal! I bet he&#x27;s goin&#x27; to he a boy. An&#x27; won&#x27;t I</p>
<p>learn &#x27;m to put up his fists an&#x27; take care of himself! An&#x27;</p>
<p>swimmin&#x27; too. If he don&#x27;t know how to swim by the time he&#x27;s</p>
<p>six...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if HE&#x27;S a girl?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;SHE&#x27;S goin&#x27; to he a boy,&quot; Billy retorted, joining in the playful</p>
<p>misuse of pronouns.</p>
<p>And both laughed and kissed, and sighed with content. &quot;I&#x27;m goin&#x27;</p>
<p>to turn pincher, now,&quot; he announced, after quite an interval of</p>
<p>meditation. &quot;No more drinks with the boys. It&#x27;s me for the water</p>
<p>wagon. And I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to ease down on smokes. Huh! Don&#x27;t see why I</p>
<p>can&#x27;t roll my own cigarettes. They&#x27;re ten times cheaper&#x27;n tailor-</p>
<p>mades. An&#x27; I can grow a beard. The amount of money the barbers</p>
<p>get out of a fellow in a year would keep a baby.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just you let your beard grow, Mister Roberts, and I&#x27;ll get a</p>
<p>divorce,&quot; Saxon threatened. &quot;You&#x27;re just too handsome and strong</p>
<p>with a smooth face. I love your face too much to have it covered</p>
<p>up.--Oh, you dear! you dear! Billy, I never knew what happiness</p>
<p>was until I came to live with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor me neither.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And it&#x27;s always going to be so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can just bet,&quot; he assured her.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I was going to he happy married,&quot; she went on; &quot;but I</p>
<p>never dreamed it would be like this.&quot; She turned her head on his</p>
<p>shoulder and kissed his cheek. &quot;Billy, it isn&#x27;t happiness. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>And Billy resolutely kept undivulged the cut in wages. Not until</p>
<p>two weeks later, when it went into effect, and he poured the</p>
<p>diminished sum into her lap, did he break it to her. The next</p>
<p>day, Bert and Mary, already a month married, had Sunday dinner</p>
<p>with them, and the matter came up for discussion. Bert was</p>
<p>particularly pessmistic, and muttered dark hints of an impending</p>
<p>strike in the railroad shops.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#x27;d all shut your traps, it&#x27;d be all right,&quot; Mary</p>
<p>criticized. &quot;These union agitators get the railroad sore. They</p>
<p>give me the cramp, the way they butt in an&#x27; stir up trouble. If I</p>
<p>was boss I&#x27;d cut the wages of any man that listened to them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet you belonged to the laundry workers&#x27; union,&quot; Saxon rebuked</p>
<p>gently.</p>
<p>&quot;Because I had to or I wouldn&#x27;t a-got work. An&#x27; much good it ever</p>
<p>done me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But look at Billy,&quot; Bert argued &quot;The teamsters ain&#x27;t ben sayin&#x27;</p>
<p>a word, not a peep, an&#x27; everything lovely, and then, bang, right</p>
<p>in the neck, a ten per cent cut. Oh, hell, what chance have we</p>
<p>got? We lose. There&#x27;s nothin&#x27; left for us in this country we&#x27;ve</p>
<p>made and our fathers an&#x27; mothers before us. We&#x27;re all shot to</p>
<p>pieces. We Can see our finish--we, the old stock, the children of</p>
<p>the white people that broke away from England an&#x27; licked the tar</p>
<p>outa her, that freed the slaves, an&#x27; fought the Indians, &#x27;an made</p>
<p>the West! Any gink with half an eye can see it comin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what are we going to do about it?&quot; Saxon questioned</p>
<p>anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Fight. That&#x27;s all. The country&#x27;s in the hands of a gang of</p>
<p>robbers. Look at the Southern Pacific. It runs California.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, rats, Bert,&quot; Billy interrupted. &quot;You&#x27;re takin&#x27; through your</p>
<p>lid. No railroad can ran the government of California.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a bonehead,&quot; Bert sneered. &quot;And some day, when it&#x27;s too</p>
<p>late, you an&#x27; all the other boneheads&#x27;ll realize the fact.</p>
<p>Rotten? I tell you it stinks. Why, there ain&#x27;t a man who wants to</p>
<p>go to state legislature but has to make a trip to San Francisco,</p>
<p>an&#x27; go into the S. P. offices, an&#x27; take his hat off, an&#x27; humbly</p>
<p>ask permission. Why, the governors of California has been</p>
<p>railroad governors since before you and I was born. Huh! You</p>
<p>can&#x27;t tell me. We&#x27;re finished. We&#x27;re licked to a frazzle. But</p>
<p>it&#x27;d do my heart good to help string up some of the dirty thieves</p>
<p>before I passed out. D&#x27;ye know what we are?--we old white stock</p>
<p>that fought in the wars, an&#x27; broke the land, an&#x27; made all this?</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell you. We&#x27;re the last of the Mohegans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He scares me to death, he&#x27;s so violent,&quot; Mary said with</p>
<p>unconcealed hostility. &quot;If he don&#x27;t quit shootin&#x27; off his mouth</p>
<p>he&#x27;ll get fired from the shops. And then what&#x27;ll we do? He don&#x27;t</p>
<p>consider me. But I can tell you one thing all right, all right.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll not go back to the laundry.&quot; She held her right hand up and</p>
<p>spoke with the solemnity of an oath. &quot;Not so&#x27;s you can see it.</p>
<p>Never again for yours truly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I know what you&#x27;re drivin&#x27; at,&quot; Bert said with asperity.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; all I can tell you is, livin&#x27; or dead, in a job or out, no</p>
<p>matter what happens to me, if you will lead that way, you will,</p>
<p>an&#x27; there&#x27;s nothin&#x27; else to it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I kept straight before I met you,&quot; she came back with a</p>
<p>toss of the head. &quot;And I kept straight after I met you, which is</p>
<p>going some if anybody should ask you.&quot;</p>
<p>Hot words were on Bert&#x27;s tongue, but Saxon intervened and brought</p>
<p>about peace. She was concerned over the outcome of their</p>
<p>marriage. Both were highstrung, both were quick and irritable,</p>
<p>and their continual clashes did not augur well for their future.</p>
<p>The safety razor was a great achievement for Saxon. Privily she</p>
<p>conferred with a clerk she knew in Pierce&#x27;s hardware store and</p>
<p>made the purchase. On Sunday morning, after breakfast, when Billy</p>
<p>was starting to go to the barber shop, she led him into the</p>
<p>bedroom, whisked a towel aside, and revealed the razor box,</p>
<p>shaving mug, soap, brush, and lather all ready. Billy recoiled,</p>
<p>then came back to make curious investigation. He gazed pityingly</p>
<p>at the safety razor.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh! Call that a man&#x27;s tool!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;ll do the work,&quot; she said. &quot;It does it for thousands of men</p>
<p>every day.&quot;</p>
<p>But Billy shook his head and backed away.</p>
<p>&quot;You shave three times a week,&quot; she urged. &quot;That&#x27;s forty-five</p>
<p>cents. Call it half a dollar, and there are fifty-two weeks in</p>
<p>the year. Twenty-six dollars a year just for shaving. Come on,</p>
<p>dear, and try it. Lots of men swear by it.&quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head mutinously, and the cloudy deeps of his eyes</p>
<p>grew more cloudy. She loved that sullen handsomeness that made</p>
<p>him look so boyish, and, laughing and kissing him, she forced him</p>
<p>into a chair, got off his coat, and unbuttoned shirt and</p>
<p>undershirt and turned them in.</p>
<p>Threatening him with, &quot;If you open your mouth to kick I&#x27;ll shove</p>
<p>it in,&quot; she coated his face with lather.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; she checked him, as he reached desperately for</p>
<p>the razor. &quot;I&#x27;ve been watching the barbers from the sidewalk.</p>
<p>This is what they do after the lather is on.&quot;</p>
<p>And thereupon she proceeded to rub the lather in with her</p>
<p>fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; she said, when she had coated his face a second time.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re ready to begin. Only remember, I&#x27;m not always going to do</p>
<p>this for you. I&#x27;m just breaking you in, you see.&quot;</p>
<p>With great outward show of rebellion, half genuine, half</p>
<p>facetious, he made several tentative scrapes with the razor. He</p>
<p>winced violently, and violently exclaimed:</p>
<p>&quot;Holy jumping Jehosaphat!&quot;</p>
<p>He examined his face in the glass, and a streak of blood showed</p>
<p>in the midst of the lather.</p>
<p>&quot;Cut!--by a safety razor, by God! Sure, men swear by it. Can&#x27;t</p>
<p>blame &#x27;em. Cut! By a safety!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But wait a second,&quot; Saxon pleaded. &quot;They have to be regulated.</p>
<p>The clerk told me. See those little screws. There ... That&#x27;s it</p>
<p>.. turn them around.&quot;</p>
<p>Again Billy applied the blade to his face. After a couple of</p>
<p>scrapes, be looked at himself closely in the mirror, grinned, and</p>
<p>went on shaving. With swiftness and dexterity he scraped his face</p>
<p>clean of lather. Saxon clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Billy approved. &quot;Great! Here. Give me your hand. See what</p>
<p>a good job it made.&quot;</p>
<p>He started to rub her hand against his cheek. Saxon jerked away</p>
<p>with a little cry of disappointment, then examined him closely.</p>
<p>&quot;It hasn&#x27;t shaved at all,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a fake, that&#x27;s what it is. It cuts the hide, but not the</p>
<p>hair. Me for the barber.&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon was persistent.</p>
<p>&quot;You haven&#x27;t given it a fair trial yet. It was regulated too</p>
<p>much. Let me try my hand at it. There, that&#x27;s it, betwixt and</p>
<p>between. Now, lather again and try it.&quot;</p>
<p>This time the unmistakable sand-papery sound of hair-severing</p>
<p>could he heard.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it?&quot; she fluttered anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;It gets the--ouch!--hair,&quot; Billy grunted, frowning and making</p>
<p>faces. &quot;But it--gee!--say!--ouch!--pulls like Sam Hill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay with it,&quot; she encouraged. &quot;Don&#x27;t give up the ship, big</p>
<p>Injun with a scalplock. Remember what Bert says and be the last</p>
<p>of the Mohegans.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of fifteen minutes he rinsed his face and dried it,</p>
<p>sighing with relief.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a shave, in a fashion, Saxon, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m stuck on</p>
<p>it. It takes out the nerve. I&#x27;m as weak as a cat.&quot;</p>
<p>He groaned with sudden discovery of fresh misfortune.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the matter now?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The back of my neck--how can I shave the back of my neck? I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>have to pay a barber to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s consternation was tragic, but it only lasted a moment.</p>
<p>She took the brush in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Sit down, Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?--you?&quot; he demanded indignantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; me. If any barber is good enough to shave your neck, and</p>
<p>then I am, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy moaned and groaned in the abjectness of humility and</p>
<p>surrender, and let her have her way.</p>
<p>&quot;There, and a good job,&quot; she informed him when she had finished.</p>
<p>&quot;As easy as falling off a log. And besides, it means twenty-six</p>
<p>dollars a year. And you&#x27;ll buy the crib, the baby buggy, the</p>
<p>pinning blankets, and lots and lots of things with it. Now sit</p>
<p>still a minute longer.&quot;</p>
<p>She rinsed and dried the back of his neck and dusted it with</p>
<p>talcum powder.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re as sweet as a clean little baby, Billy Boy.&quot;</p>
<p>The unexpected and lingering impact of her lips on the back of</p>
<p>his neck made him writhe with mingled feelings not all</p>
<p>unpleasant.</p>
<p>Two days later, though vowing in the intervening time to have</p>
<p>nothing further to do with the instrument of the devil, he</p>
<p>permitted Saxon to assist him to a second shave. This time it</p>
<p>went easier.</p>
<p>&quot;It ain&#x27;t so bad,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I&#x27;m gettin&#x27; the hang of it. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>all in the regulating. You can shave as close as you want an&#x27; no</p>
<p>more close than you want. Barbers can&#x27;t do that. Every once an&#x27;</p>
<p>awhile they get my face sore.&quot;</p>
<p>The third shave was an unqualified success, and the culminating</p>
<p>bliss was reached when Saxon presented him with a bottle of witch</p>
<p>hazel. After that he began active proselyting. He could not wait</p>
<p>a visit from Bert, but carried the paraphernalia to the latter&#x27;s</p>
<p>house to demonstrate.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve ben boobs all these years, Bert, runnin&#x27; the chances of</p>
<p>barber&#x27;s itch an&#x27; everything. Look at this, eh? See her take</p>
<p>hold. Smooth as silk. Just as easy... There! Six minutes by the</p>
<p>clock. Can you beat it? When I get my hand in, I can do it in</p>
<p>three. It works in the dark. It works under water. You couldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>cut yourself if you tried. And it saves twenty-six dollars a</p>
<p>year. Saxon figured it out, and she&#x27;s a wonder, I tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>The trafficking between Saxon and Mercedes increased. The latter</p>
<p>commanded a ready market for all the fine work Saxon could</p>
<p>supply, while Saxon was eager and happy in the work. The expected</p>
<p>babe and the cut in Billy&#x27;s wages had caused her to regard the</p>
<p>economic phase of existence more seriously than ever. Too little</p>
<p>money was being laid away in the bank, and her conscience pricked</p>
<p>her as she considered how much she was laying out on the pretty</p>
<p>necessaries for the household and herself. Also, for the first</p>
<p>time in her life she was spending another&#x27;s earnings. Since a</p>
<p>young girl she had been used to spending her own, and now, thanks</p>
<p>to Mercedes she was doing it again, and, out of her profits,</p>
<p>assaying more expensive and delightful adventures in lingerie.</p>
<p>Mercedes suggested, and Saxon carried out and even bettered, the</p>
<p>dainty things of thread and texture. She made ruffled chemises of</p>
<p>sheer linen, with her own fine edgings and French embroidery on</p>
<p>breast and shoulders; linen hand-made combination undersuits; and</p>
<p>nightgowns, fairy and cobwebby, embroidered, trimmed with Irish</p>
<p>lace. On Mercedes&#x27; instigation she executed an ambitious and</p>
<p>wonderful breakfast cap for which the old woman returned her</p>
<p>twelve dollars after deducting commission.</p>
<p>She was happy and busy every waking moment, nor was preparation</p>
<p>for the little one neglected. The only ready made garments she</p>
<p>bought were three fine little knit shirts. As for the rest, every</p>
<p>bit was made by her own hands--featherstitched pinning blankets,</p>
<p>a crocheted jacket and cap, knitted mittens, embroidered bonnets;</p>
<p>slim little princess slips of sensible length; underskirts on</p>
<p>absurd Lilliputian yokes; silk-embroidered white flannel</p>
<p>petticoats; stockings and crocheted boots, seeming to burgeon</p>
<p>before her eyes with wriggly pink toes and plump little calves;</p>
<p>and last, but not least, many deliciously soft squares of</p>
<p>bird&#x27;s-eye linen. A little later, as a crowning masterpiece, she</p>
<p>was guilty of a dress coat of white silk, embroidered. And into</p>
<p>all the tiny garments, with every stitch, she sewed love. Yet</p>
<p>this love, so unceasingly sewn, she knew when she came to</p>
<p>consider and marvel, was more of Billy than of the nebulous,</p>
<p>ungraspable new bit of life that eluded her fondest attempts at</p>
<p>visioning.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s comment, as he went over the mite&#x27;s wardrobe</p>
<p>and came back to center on the little knit shirts, &quot;they look</p>
<p>more like a real kid than the whole kit an&#x27; caboodle. Why, I can</p>
<p>see him in them regular manshirts.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon, with a sudden rush of happy, unshed tears, held one of the</p>
<p>little shirts up to his lips. He kissed it solemnly, his eyes</p>
<p>resting on Saxon&#x27;s.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s some for the boy,&quot; he said, &quot;but a whole lot for you.&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon&#x27;s money-earning was doomed to cease ignominiously and</p>
<p>tragically. One day, to take advantage of a department store</p>
<p>bargain sale, she crossed the bay to San Francisco. Passing along</p>
<p>Sutter Street, her eye was attracted by a display in the small</p>
<p>window of a small shop. At first she could not believe it; yet</p>
<p>there, in the honored place of the window, was the wonderful</p>
<p>breakfast cap for which she had received twelve dollars from</p>
<p>Mercedes. It was marked twenty-eight dollars. Saxon went in and</p>
<p>interviewed the shopkeeper, an emaciated, shrewd-eyed and</p>
<p>middle-aged woman of foreign extraction.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t want to buy anything,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;I make nice</p>
<p>things like you have here, and I wanted to know what you pay for</p>
<p>them-for that breakfast cap in the window, for instance.&quot;</p>
<p>The woman darted a keen glance to Saxon&#x27;s left hand, noted the</p>
<p>innumerable tiny punctures in the ends of the first and second</p>
<p>fingers, then appraised her clothing and her face.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you do work like that?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;I paid twenty dollars to the woman that made that.&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>repressed an almost spasmodic gasp, and thought coolly for a</p>
<p>space. Mercedes had given her twelve. Then Mercedes had pocketed</p>
<p>eight, while she, Saxon, had furnished the material and labor.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you please show me other hand-made things nightgowns,</p>
<p>chemises, and such things, and tell me the prices you pay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you do such work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And will you sell to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; Saxon answered. &quot;That is why I am here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We add only a small amount when we sell,&quot; the woman went on;</p>
<p>&quot;you see, light and rent and such things, as well as a profit or</p>
<p>else we could not be here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s only fair,&quot; Saxon agreed.</p>
<p>Amongst the beautiful stuff Saxon went over, she found a</p>
<p>nightgown and a combination undersuit of her own manufacture. For</p>
<p>the former she had received eight dollars from Mercedes, it was</p>
<p>marked eighteen, and the woman had paid fourteen; for the latter</p>
<p>Saxon received six, it was marked fifteen, and the woman had paid</p>
<p>eleven.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; Saxon said, as she drew on her gloves. &quot;I should</p>
<p>like to bring you some of my work at those prices.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I shall be glad to buy it ... if it is up to the mark.&quot; The</p>
<p>woman looked at her severely. &quot;Mind you, it must be as good as</p>
<p>this. And if it is, I often get special orders, and I&#x27;ll give you</p>
<p>a chance at them.&quot;</p>
<p>Mercedes was unblushingly candid when Saxon reproached her.</p>
<p>&quot;You told me you took only a commission,&quot; was Saxon&#x27;s accusation.</p>
<p>&quot;So I did; and so I have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I did all the work and bought all the materials, yet you</p>
<p>actually cleared more out of it than I did. You got the lion&#x27;s</p>
<p>share.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And why shouldn&#x27;t I, my dear? I was the middleman. It&#x27;s the way</p>
<p>of the world. &#x27;Tis the middlemen that get the lion&#x27;s share.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me most unfair,&quot; Saxon reflected, more in sadness</p>
<p>than anger.</p>
<p>&quot;That is your quarrel with the world, not with me,&quot; Mercedes</p>
<p>rejoined sharply, then immediately softened with one of her quick</p>
<p>changes. &quot;We mustn&#x27;t quarrel, my dear. I like you so much. La la,</p>
<p>it is nothing to you, who are young and strong with a man young</p>
<p>and strong. Listen, I am an old woman. And old Barry can do</p>
<p>little for me. He is on his last legs. His kidneys are &#x27;most</p>
<p>gone. Remember, &#x27;tis I must bury him. And I do him honor, for</p>
<p>beside me he&#x27;ll have his last long steep. A stupid, dull old man,</p>
<p>heavy, an ox, &#x27;tis true; but a good old fool with no trace of</p>
<p>evil in him. The plot is bought and paid for--the final</p>
<p>installment was made up, in part, out of my commissions from you.</p>
<p>Then there are the funeral expenses. It must be done nicely. I</p>
<p>have still much to save. And Barry may turn up his toes any day.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon sniffed the air carefully, and knew the old woman had been</p>
<p>drinking again.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, my dear, let me show you.&quot; Leading Saxon to a large sea</p>
<p>chest in the bedroom, Mercedes lifted the lid. A faint perfume,</p>
<p>as of rose-petals, floated up. &quot;Behold, my burial trousseau. Thus</p>
<p>I shall wed the dust.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s amazement increased, as, article by article, the old</p>
<p>woman displayed the airiest, the daintiest, the most delicious</p>
<p>and most complete of bridal outfits. Mercedes held up an ivory</p>
<p>fan.</p>
<p>&quot;In Venice &#x27;twas given me, my dear.--See, this comb, turtle</p>
<p>shell; Bruce Anstey made it for me the week before he drank his</p>
<p>last bottle and scattered his brave mad brains with a Colt&#x27;s</p>
<p>44.--This scarf. La la, a Liberty scarf--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And all that will be buried with you,&quot; Saxon mused, &quot;Oh, the</p>
<p>extravagance of it!&quot;</p>
<p>Mercedes laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Why not? I shall die as I have lived. It is my pleasure. I go to</p>
<p>the dust as a bride. No cold and narrow bed for me. I would it</p>
<p>were a coach, covered with the soft things of the East, and</p>
<p>pillows, pillows, without end.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would buy you twenty funerals and twenty plots,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>protested, shocked by this blasphemy of conventional death. &quot;It</p>
<p>is downright wicked.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Twill be as I have lived,&quot; Mercedes said complacently. &quot;And</p>
<p>it&#x27;s a fine bride old Barry&#x27;ll have to come and lie beside him.&quot;</p>
<p>She closed the lid and sighed. &quot;Though I wish it were Bruce</p>
<p>Anstey, or any of the pick of my young men to lie with me in the</p>
<p>great dark and to crumble with me to the dust that is the real</p>
<p>death.&quot;</p>
<p>She gazed at Saxon with eyes heated by alcohol and at the same</p>
<p>time cool with the coolness of content.</p>
<p>&quot;In the old days the great of earth were buried with their live</p>
<p>slaves with them. I but take my flimsies, my dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you aren&#x27;t afraid of death? ...in the least?&quot;</p>
<p>Mercedes shook her head emphatically.</p>
<p>&quot;Death is brave, and good, and kind. I do not fear death. &#x27;Tis of</p>
<p>men I am afraid when I am dead. So I prepare. They shall not have</p>
<p>me when I am dead.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was puzzled.</p>
<p>&quot;They would not want you then,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Many are wanted,&quot; was the answer. &quot;Do you know what becomes of</p>
<p>the aged poor who have no money for burial? They are not buried.</p>
<p>Let me tell you. We stood before great doors. He was a queer man,</p>
<p>a professor who ought to have been a pirate, a man who lectured</p>
<p>in class rooms when he ought to have been storming walled cities</p>
<p>or robbing banks. He was slender, like Don Juan. His hands were</p>
<p>strong as steel. So was his spirit. And he was mad, a bit mad, as</p>
<p>all my young men have been. &#x27;Come, Mercedes,&#x27; he said; &#x27;we will</p>
<p>inspect our brethren and become humble, and glad that we are not</p>
<p>as they--as yet not yet. And afterward, to-night, we will dine</p>
<p>with a more devilish taste, and we will drink to them in golden</p>
<p>wine that will be the more golden for having seen them. Come,</p>
<p>Mercedes.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;He thrust the great doors open, and by the hand led me in. It</p>
<p>was a sad company. Twenty-four, that lay on marble slabs, or sat,</p>
<p>half erect and propped, while many young men, bright of eye,</p>
<p>bright little knives in their hands, glanced curiously at me from</p>
<p>their work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were dead?&quot; Saxon interrupted to gasp.</p>
<p>&quot;They were the pauper dead, my dear. &#x27;Come, Mercedes,&#x27; said he.</p>
<p>&#x27;There is more to show you that will make us glad we are alive.&#x27;</p>
<p>And he took me down, down to the vats. The salt vats, my dear. I</p>
<p>was not afraid. But it was in my mind, then, as I looked, how it</p>
<p>would be with me when I was dead. And there they were, so many</p>
<p>lumps of pork. And the order came, &#x27;A woman; an old woman.&#x27; And</p>
<p>the man who worked there fished in the vats. The first was a man</p>
<p>he drew to see. Again he fished and stirred. Again a man. He was</p>
<p>impatient, and grumbled at his luck. And then, up through the</p>
<p>brine, he drew a woman, and by the face of her she was old, and</p>
<p>he was satisfied.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is not true!&quot; Saxon cried out.</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen, my dear, I know. And I tell you fear not the wrath</p>
<p>of God when you are dead. Fear only the salt vats. And as I stood</p>
<p>and looked, and as be who led me there looked at me and smiled</p>
<p>and questioned and bedeviled me with those mad, black,</p>
<p>tired-scholar&#x27;s eyes of his, I knew that that was no way for my</p>
<p>dear clay. Dear it is, my clay to me; dear it has been to others.</p>
<p>La la, the salt vat is no place for my kissed lips and love-</p>
<p>lavished body.&quot; Mercedes lifted the lid of the chest and gazed</p>
<p>fondly at her burial pretties. &quot;So I have made my bed. So I shall</p>
<p>lie in it. Some old philosopher said we know we must die; we do</p>
<p>not believe it. But the old do believe. I believe.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, remember the salt vats, and do not be angry with me</p>
<p>because my commissions have been heavy. To escape the vats I</p>
<p>would stop at nothing steal the widow&#x27;s mite, the orphan&#x27;s crust,</p>
<p>and pennies from a dead man&#x27;s eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; Saxon asked abruptly, holding herself</p>
<p>together despite cold horror.</p>
<p>Mercedes dropped the lid and shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows? I shall rest well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And punishment?&quot; Saxon probed, remembering the unthinkable tale</p>
<p>of the other&#x27;s life.</p>
<p>&quot;Impossible, my dear. As some old poet said, &#x27;God&#x27;s a good</p>
<p>fellow.&#x27; Some time I shall talk to you about God. Never be afraid</p>
<p>of him. Be afraid only of the salt vats and the things men may do</p>
<p>with your pretty flesh after you are dead.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>Billy quarreled with good fortune. He suspected he was too</p>
<p>prosperous on the wages he received. What with the accumulating</p>
<p>savings account, the paying of the monthly furniture installment</p>
<p>and the house rent, the spending money in pocket, and the good</p>
<p>fare he was eating, he was puzzled as to how Saxon managed to pay</p>
<p>for the goods used in her fancy work. Several times he had</p>
<p>suggested his inability to see how she did it, and been baffled</p>
<p>each time by Saxon&#x27;s mysterious laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t see how you do it on the money,&quot; he was contending one</p>
<p>evening.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak further, then closed it and for five</p>
<p>minutes thought with knitted brows.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;what&#x27;s become of that frilly breakfast cap you</p>
<p>was workin&#x27; on so hard, I ain&#x27;t never seen you wear it, and it</p>
<p>was sure too big for the kid.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon hesitated, with pursed lips and teasing eyes. With her,</p>
<p>untruthfulness had always been a difficult matter. To Billy it</p>
<p>was impossible. She could see the cloud-drift in his eyes</p>
<p>deepening and his face hardening in the way she knew so well when</p>
<p>he was vexed.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon, you ain&#x27;t ... you ain&#x27;t ... sellin&#x27; your work?&quot;</p>
<p>And thereat she related everything, not omitting Mercedes</p>
<p>Higgins&#x27; part in the transaction, nor Mercedes Higgins&#x27;</p>
<p>remarkable burial trousseau. But Billy was not to be led aside by</p>
<p>the latter. In terms anything but uncertain he told Saxon that</p>
<p>she was not to work for money.</p>
<p>&quot;But I have so much spare time, Billy, dear,&quot; she pleaded.</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing doing. I won&#x27;t listen to it. I married you, and I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>take care of you. Nobody can say Bill Roberts&#x27; wife has to work.</p>
<p>And I don&#x27;t want to think it myself. Besides, it ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>necessary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Billy--&quot; she began again.</p>
<p>&quot;Nope. That&#x27;s one thing I won&#x27;t stand for, Saxon. Not that I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t like fancy work. I do. I like it like hell, every bit you</p>
<p>make, but I like it on YOU. Go ahead and make all you want of it,</p>
<p>for yourself, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll put up for the goods. Why, I&#x27;m just</p>
<p>whistlin&#x27; an&#x27; happy all day long, thinkin&#x27; of the boy an&#x27; seein&#x27;</p>
<p>you at home here workin&#x27; away on all them nice things. Because I</p>
<p>know how happy you are a-doin&#x27; it. But honest to God, Saxon, it&#x27;d</p>
<p>all be spoiled if I knew you was doin&#x27; it to sell. You see, Bill</p>
<p>Roberts&#x27; wife don&#x27;t have to work. That&#x27;s my brag--to myself, mind</p>
<p>you. An&#x27; besides, it ain&#x27;t right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a dear,&quot; she whispered, happy despite her disappointment.</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to have all you want,&quot; be continued. &quot;An&#x27; you&#x27;re</p>
<p>goin&#x27; to get it as long as I got two hands stickin&#x27; on the ends</p>
<p>of my arms. I guess I know how good the things are you wear--good</p>
<p>to me, I mean, too. I&#x27;m dry behind the ears, an&#x27; maybe I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>learned a few things I oughtn&#x27;t to before I knew you. But I know</p>
<p>what I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; about, and I want to say that outside the</p>
<p>clothes down underneath, an&#x27; the clothes down underneath the</p>
<p>outside ones, I never saw a woman like you. Oh--&quot;</p>
<p>He threw up his hands as if despairing of ability to express what</p>
<p>he thought and felt, then essayed a further attempt.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not a matter of bein&#x27; only clean, though that&#x27;s a whole</p>
<p>lot. Lots of women are clean. It ain&#x27;t that. It&#x27;s something more,</p>
<p>an&#x27; different. It&#x27;s ... well, it&#x27;s the look of it, so white, an&#x27;</p>
<p>pretty, an&#x27; tasty. It gets on the imagination. It&#x27;s something I</p>
<p>can&#x27;t get out of my thoughts of you. I want to tell you lots of</p>
<p>men can&#x27;t strip to advantage, an&#x27; lots of women, too. But</p>
<p>you--well, you&#x27;re a wonder, that&#x27;s all, and you can&#x27;t get too</p>
<p>many of them nice things to suit me, and you can&#x27;t get them too</p>
<p>nice.</p>
<p>&quot;For that matter, Saxon, you can just blow yourself. There&#x27;s lots</p>
<p>of easy money layin&#x27; around. I&#x27;m in great condition. Billy Murphy</p>
<p>pulled down seventy-five round iron dollars only last week for</p>
<p>puttin&#x27; away the Pride of North Beach. That&#x27;s what ha paid us the</p>
<p>fifty back out of.&quot;</p>
<p>But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s Carl Hansen,&quot; Billy argued. &quot;The second Sharkey, the</p>
<p>alfalfa sportin&#x27; writers are callin&#x27; him. An&#x27; he calls himself</p>
<p>Champion of the United States Navy. Well, I got his number. He&#x27;s</p>
<p>just a big stiff. I&#x27;ve seen &#x27;m fight, an&#x27; I can pass him the</p>
<p>sleep medicine just as easy. The Secretary of the Sportin&#x27; Life</p>
<p>Club offered to match me. An&#x27; a hundred iron dollars in it for</p>
<p>the winner. And it&#x27;ll all be yours to blow in any way you want.</p>
<p>What d&#x27;ye say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I can&#x27;t work for money, you can&#x27;t fight,&quot; was Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>ultimatum, immediately withdrawn. &quot;But you and I don&#x27;t drive</p>
<p>bargains. Even if you&#x27;d let me work for money, I wouldn&#x27;t let you</p>
<p>fight. I&#x27;ve never forgotten what you told me about how</p>
<p>prizefighters lose their silk. Well, you&#x27;re not going to lose</p>
<p>yours. It&#x27;s half my silk, you know. And if you won&#x27;t fight, I</p>
<p>won&#x27;t work--there. And more, I&#x27;ll never do anything you don&#x27;t</p>
<p>want me to, Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Same here,&quot; Billy agreed. &quot;Though just the same I&#x27;d like most to</p>
<p>death to have just one go at that squarehead Hansen.&quot; He smiled</p>
<p>with pleasure at the thought. &quot;Say, let&#x27;s forget it all now, an&#x27;</p>
<p>you sing me &#x27;Harvest Days&#x27; on that dinky what-you-may-call-it.&quot;</p>
<p>When she had complied, accompanying herself on the ukulele, she</p>
<p>suggested his weird &quot;Cowboy&#x27;s Lament.&quot; In some inexplicable way</p>
<p>of love, she had come to like her husband&#x27;s one song. Because he</p>
<p>sang it, she liked its inanity and monotonousness; and most of</p>
<p>all, it seemed to her, she loved his hopeless and adorable</p>
<p>flatting of every note. She could even sing with him, flatting as</p>
<p>accurately and deliciously as he. Nor did she undeceive him in</p>
<p>his sublime faith.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess Bert an&#x27; the rest have joshed me all the time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;You and I get along together with it fine,&quot; she equivoeated; for</p>
<p>in such matters she did not deem the untruth a wrong.</p>
<p>Spring was on when the strike came in the railroad shops. The</p>
<p>Sunday before it was called, Saxon and Billy had dinner at Bert&#x27;s</p>
<p>house. Saxon&#x27;s brother came, though he had found it impossible to</p>
<p>bring Sarah, who refused to budge from her household rut. Bert</p>
<p>was blackly pessimistic, and they found him singing with sardonic</p>
<p>glee:</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody loves a mil-yun-aire.</p>
<p>Nobody likes his looks.</p>
<p>Nobody&#x27;ll share his slightest care,</p>
<p>He classes with thugs and crooks.</p>
<p>Thriftiness has become a crime,</p>
<p>So spend everything you earn;</p>
<p>We&#x27;re living now in a funny time,</p>
<p>When money is made to burn.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary went about the dinner preparation, flaunting unmistakable</p>
<p>signals of rebellion; and Saxon, rolling up her sleeves and tying</p>
<p>on an apron, washed the breakfast dishes. Bert fetched a pitcher</p>
<p>of steaming beer from the corner saloon, and the three men smoked</p>
<p>and talked about the coming strike.</p>
<p>&quot;It oughta come years ago,&quot; was Bert&#x27;s dictum. &quot;It can&#x27;t come any</p>
<p>too quick now to suit me, but it&#x27;s too late. We&#x27;re beaten thumbs</p>
<p>donn. Here&#x27;s where the last of the Mohegans gets theirs, in the</p>
<p>neck, ker-whop!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Tom, who had been smoking his pipe gravely,</p>
<p>began to counsel. &quot;Organized labor&#x27;s gettin&#x27; stronger every day.</p>
<p>Why, I can remember when there wasn&#x27;t any unions in California,</p>
<p>Look at us now--wages, an&#x27; hours, an&#x27; everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You talk like an organizer,&quot; Bert sneered, &quot;shovin&#x27; the bull con</p>
<p>on the boneheads. But we know different. Organized wages won&#x27;t</p>
<p>buy as much now as unorganized wages used to buy. They&#x27;ve got us</p>
<p>whipsawed. Look at Frisco, the labor leaders doin&#x27; dirtier</p>
<p>polities than the old parties, pawin&#x27; an&#x27; squabblin&#x27; over graft,</p>
<p>an&#x27; goin&#x27; to San Quentin, while--what are the Frisco carpenters</p>
<p>doin&#x27;? Let me tell you one thing, Tom Brown, if you listen to all</p>
<p>you hear you&#x27;ll hear that every Frisco carpenter is union an&#x27;</p>
<p>gettin&#x27; full union wages. Do you believe it? It&#x27;s a damn lie.</p>
<p>There ain&#x27;t a carpenter that don&#x27;t rebate his wages Saturday</p>
<p>night to the contractor. An&#x27; that&#x27;s your buildin&#x27; trades in San</p>
<p>Francisco, while the leaders are makin&#x27; trips to Europe on the</p>
<p>earnings of the tenderloin--when they ain&#x27;t coughing it up to the</p>
<p>lawyers to get out of wearin&#x27; stripes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s all right,&quot; Tom concurred. &quot;Nobody&#x27;s denyin&#x27; it. The</p>
<p>trouble is labor ain&#x27;t quite got its eyes open. It ought to play</p>
<p>politics, but the politics ought to be the right kind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Socialism, eh?&quot; Bert caught him up with scorn. &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t they</p>
<p>sell us out just as the Ruefs and Schmidts have?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Get men that are honest,&quot; Billy said. &quot;That&#x27;s the whole trouble.</p>
<p>Not that I stand for socialism. I don&#x27;t. All our folks was a long</p>
<p>time in America, an&#x27; I for one won&#x27;t stand for a lot of fat</p>
<p>Germans an&#x27; greasy Russian Jews tellin&#x27; me how to run my country</p>
<p>when they can&#x27;t speak English yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your country!&quot; Bert cried. &quot;Why, you bonehead, you ain&#x27;t got a</p>
<p>country. That&#x27;s a fairy story the grafters shove at you every</p>
<p>time they want to rob you some more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But don&#x27;t vote for the grafters,&quot; Billy contended. &quot;If we</p>
<p>selected honest men we&#x27;d get honest treatment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish you&#x27;d come to some of our meetings, Billy,&quot; Tom said</p>
<p>wistfully. &quot;If you would, you&#x27;d get your eyes open an&#x27; vote the</p>
<p>socialist ticket next election.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not on your life,&quot; Billy declined. &quot;&quot;When you catch me in a</p>
<p>socialist meeting&#x27;ll be when they can talk like white men.&quot;</p>
<p>Bert was humming:</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re living now in a funny time,</p>
<p>When money is made to burn.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary was too angry with her husband, because of the impending</p>
<p>strike and his incendiary utterances, to hold conversation with</p>
<p>Saxon, and the latter, bepuzzled, listened to the conflicting</p>
<p>opinions of the men.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are we at?&quot; she asked them, with a merriness that</p>
<p>concealed her anxiety at heart.</p>
<p>&quot;We ain&#x27;t at,&quot; Bert snarled. &quot;We&#x27;re gone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But meat and oil have gone up again,&quot; she chafed. &quot;And Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>wages have been cut, and the shop men&#x27;s were cut last year.</p>
<p>Something must be done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing to do is fight like hell,&quot; Bert answered. &quot;Fight,</p>
<p>an&#x27; go down fightin&#x27;. That&#x27;s all. We&#x27;re licked anyhow, but we can</p>
<p>have a last run for our money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s no way to talk,&quot; Tom rebuked.</p>
<p>&quot;The time for talkin&#x27; &#x27;s past, old cock. The time for fightin&#x27; &#x27;s</p>
<p>come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A hell of a chance you&#x27;d have against regular troops and machine</p>
<p>guns,&quot; Billy retorted.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, not that way. There&#x27;s such things as greasy sticks that go</p>
<p>up with a loud noise and leave holes. There&#x27;s such things as</p>
<p>emery powder--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ho!&quot; Mary burst out upon him, arms akimbo. &quot;So that&#x27;s what</p>
<p>it means. That&#x27;s what the emery in your vest pocket meant.&quot;</p>
<p>Her husband ignored her. Tom smoked with a troubled air. Billy</p>
<p>was hurt. It showed plainly in his face.</p>
<p>&quot;You ain&#x27;t ben doin&#x27; that, Bert?&quot; he asked, his manner showing</p>
<p>his expectancy of his friend&#x27;s denial.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing, if you wont to know. I&#x27;d see&#x27;m all in hell if I</p>
<p>could, before I go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s a bloody-minded anarchist,&quot; Mary complained. &quot;Men like him</p>
<p>killed McKinley, and Garfield, an&#x27;--an&#x27; an&#x27; all the rest. He&#x27;ll</p>
<p>be hung. You&#x27;ll see. Mark my words. I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s no children</p>
<p>in sight, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s hot air,&quot; Billy comforted her.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s just teasing you,&quot; Saxon soothed. &quot;He always was a josher.&quot;</p>
<p>But Mary shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;I know. I hear him talkin&#x27; in his sleep. He swears and curses</p>
<p>something awful, an&#x27; grits his teeth. Listen to him now.&quot;</p>
<p>Bert, his handsome face bitter and devil-may-care, had tilted his</p>
<p>chair back against the wall and was singing</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody loves a mil-yun-aire,</p>
<p>Nobody likes his looks,</p>
<p>Nobody&#x27;ll share his slightest care,</p>
<p>He classes with thugs and crooks.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom was saying something about reasonableness and justice, and</p>
<p>Bert ceased from singing to catch him up.</p>
<p>&quot;Justice, eh? Another pipe-dream. I&#x27;ll show you where the working</p>
<p>class gets justice. You remember Forbes--J. Alliston</p>
<p>Forbes--wrecked the Alta California Trust Company an&#x27; salted down</p>
<p>two cold millions. I saw him yesterday, in a big hell-bent</p>
<p>automobile. What&#x27;d he get? Eight years&#x27; sentence. How long did he</p>
<p>serve? Less&#x27;n two years. Pardoned out on account of ill health.</p>
<p>Ill hell! We&#x27;ll be dead an&#x27; rotten before he kicks the bucket.</p>
<p>Here. Look out this window. You see the back of that house with</p>
<p>the broken porch rail. Mrs. Danaker lives there. She takes in</p>
<p>washin&#x27;. Her old man was killed on the railroad. Nitsky on</p>
<p>damages--contributory negligence, or</p>
<p>fellow-servant-something-or-other flimflam. That&#x27;s what the</p>
<p>courts handed her. Her boy, Archie, was sixteen. He was on the</p>
<p>road, a regular road-kid. He blew into Fresno an&#x27; rolled a drunk.</p>
<p>Do you want to know how much he got? Two dollars and eighty</p>
<p>cents. Get that? --Two-eighty. And what did the alfalfa judge</p>
<p>hand&#x27;m? Fifty years. He&#x27;s served eight of it already in San</p>
<p>Quentin. And he&#x27;ll go on serving it till he croaks. Mrs. Danaker</p>
<p>says he&#x27;s bad with consumption--caught it inside, but she ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>got the pull to get&#x27;m pardoned. Archie the Kid steals two dollars</p>
<p>an&#x27; eighty cents from a drunk and gets fifty years. J. Alliston</p>
<p>Forbes sticks up the Alta Trust for two millions en&#x27; gets less&#x27;n</p>
<p>two years. Who&#x27;s country is this anyway? Yourn an&#x27; Archie the</p>
<p>Kid&#x27;s? Guess again. It&#x27;s J. Alliston Forbes&#x27;--Oh:</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody likes a mil-yun-aire,</p>
<p>Nobody likes hia looks,</p>
<p>Nobody&#x27;ll share his slightest care,</p>
<p>He classes with thugs and crooks.&quot;</p>
<p>Mary, at the sink, where Saxon was just finishing the last dish,</p>
<p>untied Saxon&#x27;s apron and kissed her with the sympathy that women</p>
<p>alone feel for each other under the shadow of maternity.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you sit down, dear. You mustn&#x27;t tire yourself, and it&#x27;s a</p>
<p>long way to go yet. I&#x27;ll get your sewing for you, and you can</p>
<p>listen to the men talk. But don&#x27;t listen to Bert. He&#x27;s crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon sewed and listened, and Bert&#x27;s face grew bleak and bitter</p>
<p>as he contemplated the baby clothes in her lap.</p>
<p>&quot;There you go,&quot; he blurted out, &quot;bringin&#x27; kids into the world</p>
<p>when you ain&#x27;t got any guarantee you can feed em.</p>
<p>&quot;You must a-had a souse last night,&quot; Tom grinned.</p>
<p>Bert shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, what&#x27;s the use of gettin&#x27; grouched?&quot; Billy cheered. &quot;It&#x27;s a</p>
<p>pretty good country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It WAS a pretty good country,&quot; Bert replied, &quot;when we was all</p>
<p>Mohegans. But not now. We&#x27;re jiggerooed. We&#x27;re hornswoggled.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re backed to a standstill. We&#x27;re double-crossed to a</p>
<p>fare-you-well. My folks fought for this country. So did yourn,</p>
<p>all of you. We freed the niggers, killed the Indians, an starved,</p>
<p>an&#x27; froze, an&#x27; sweat, an&#x27; fought. This land looked good to us. We</p>
<p>cleared it, an&#x27; broke it, an&#x27; made the roads, an&#x27; built the</p>
<p>cities. And there was plenty for everyhody. And we went on</p>
<p>fightin&#x27; for it. I had two uncles killed at Gettysburg. All of us</p>
<p>was mixed up in that war. Listen to Saxon talk any time what her</p>
<p>folks went through to get out here an&#x27; get ranches, an&#x27; horses,</p>
<p>an&#x27; cattle, an&#x27; everything. And they got &#x27;em. All our folks&#x27; got</p>
<p>&#x27;em, Mary&#x27;s, too--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if they&#x27;d ben smart they&#x27;d a-held on to them,&quot; she</p>
<p>interpolated.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Bert continued. &quot;That&#x27;s the very point. We&#x27;re the</p>
<p>losers. We&#x27;ve ben robbed. We couldn&#x27;t mark cards, deal from the</p>
<p>bottom, an&#x27; ring in cold decks like the others. We&#x27;re the white</p>
<p>folks that failed. You see, times changed, and there was two</p>
<p>kinds of us, the lions and the plugs. The plugs only worked, the</p>
<p>lions only gobbled. They gobbled the farms, the mines, the</p>
<p>factories, an&#x27; now they&#x27;ve gobbled the government. We&#x27;re the</p>
<p>white folks an&#x27; the children of white folks, that was too busy</p>
<p>being good to be smart. We&#x27;re the white folks that lost out.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re the ones that&#x27;s ben skinned. D&#x27;ye get me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;d make a good soap-boxer,&quot; Tom commended, &quot;if only you&#x27;d get</p>
<p>the kinks straightened out in your reasoning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds all right, Bert,&quot; Billy said, &quot;only it ain&#x27;t. Any man</p>
<p>can get rich to-day--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or be president of the United States,&quot; Bert snapped. &quot;Sure</p>
<p>thing--if he&#x27;s got it in him. Just the same I ain&#x27;t heard you</p>
<p>makin&#x27; a noise like a millionaire or a president. Why? You ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>got it in you. You&#x27;re a bonehead. A plug. That&#x27;s why. Skiddoo for</p>
<p>you. Skiddoo for all of us.&quot;</p>
<p>At the table, while they ate, Tom talked of the joys of</p>
<p>farm-life he had known as a boy and as a young man, and confided</p>
<p>that it was his dream to go and take up government land somewhere</p>
<p>as his people had done before him. Unfortunately, as he</p>
<p>explained, Sarah was set, so that the dream must remain a dream.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all in the game,&quot; Billy sighed. &quot;It&#x27;s played to rules. Some</p>
<p>one has to get knocked out, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>A little later, while Bert was off on a fresh diatribe, Billy</p>
<p>became aware that he was making comparisons. This house was not</p>
<p>like his house. Here was no satisfying atmosphere. Things seemed</p>
<p>to run with a jar. He recollected that when they arrived the</p>
<p>breakfast dishes had not yet been washed. With a man&#x27;s general</p>
<p>obliviousness of household affairs, he had not noted details; yet</p>
<p>it had been borne in on him, all morning, in a myriad ways, that</p>
<p>Mary was not the housekeeper Saxon was. He glanced proudly across</p>
<p>at her, and felt the spur of an impulse to leave his seat, go</p>
<p>around, and embrace her. She was a wife. He remembered her dainty</p>
<p>undergarmenting, and on the instant, into his brain, leaped the</p>
<p>image of her so appareled, only to be shattered by Bert.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Bill, you seem to think I&#x27;ve got a grouch. Sure thing. I</p>
<p>have. You ain&#x27;t had my experiences. You&#x27;ve always done teamin&#x27;</p>
<p>an&#x27; pulled down easy money prizefightin&#x27;. You ain&#x27;t known hard</p>
<p>times. You ain&#x27;t ben through strikes. You ain&#x27;t had to take care</p>
<p>of an old mother an&#x27; swallow dirt on her account. It wasn&#x27;t until</p>
<p>after she died that I could rip loose an&#x27; take or leave as I felt</p>
<p>like it.</p>
<p>&quot;Take that time I tackled the Niles Electric an&#x27; see what a</p>
<p>work-plug gets handed out to him. The Head Cheese sizes me up,</p>
<p>pumps me a lot of questions, an&#x27; gives me an application blank. I</p>
<p>make it out, payin&#x27; a dollar to a doctor they sent me to for a</p>
<p>health certificate. Then I got to go to a picture garage an&#x27; get</p>
<p>my mug taken for the Niles Electric rogues&#x27; gallery. And I cough</p>
<p>up another dollar for the mug. The Head Squirt takes the blank,</p>
<p>the health certificate, and the mug, an&#x27; fires more questions.</p>
<p>DID I BELONG TO A LABOR UNION?--ME? Of course I told&#x27;m the truth</p>
<p>I guess nit. I needed the job. The grocery wouldn&#x27;t give me any</p>
<p>more tick, and there was my mother.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh, thinks I, here&#x27;s where I&#x27;m a real carman. Back platform for</p>
<p>me, where I can pick up the fancy skirts. Nitsky. Two dollars,</p>
<p>please. Me--my two dollars. All for a pewter badge. Then there</p>
<p>was the uniform--nineteen fifty, and get it anywhere else for</p>
<p>fifteen. Only that was to be paid out of my first month. And then</p>
<p>five dollars in change in my pocket, my own money. That was the</p>
<p>rule.--I borrowed that five from Tom Donovan, the policeman. Then</p>
<p>what? They worked me for two weeks without pay, breakin&#x27; me in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you pick up any fancy skirts?&quot; Saxon queried teasingly.</p>
<p>Bert shook his head glumly.</p>
<p>&quot;I only worked a month. Then we organized, and they busted our</p>
<p>union higher&#x27;n a kite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you boobs in the shops will be busted the same way if you go</p>
<p>out on strike,&quot; Mary informed him.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve ben tellin&#x27; you all along,&quot; Bert replied. &quot;We</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t got a chance to win.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why go out?&quot; was Saxon&#x27;s question.</p>
<p>He looked at her with lackluster eyes for a moment, then answered</p>
<p>&quot;Why did my two uncles get killed at Gettysburg?&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>Saxon went about her housework greatly troubled. She no longer</p>
<p>devoted herself to the making of pretties. The materials cost</p>
<p>money, and she did not dare. Bert&#x27;s thrust had sunk home. It</p>
<p>remained in her quivering consciousness like a shaft of steel</p>
<p>that ever turned and rankled. She and Billy were responsible for</p>
<p>this coming young life. Could they be sure, after all, that they</p>
<p>could adequately feed and clothe it and prepare it for its way in</p>
<p>the world? Where was the guaranty? She remembered, dimly, the</p>
<p>blight of hard times in the past, and the plaints of fathers and</p>
<p>mothers in those days returned to her with a new significance.</p>
<p>Almost could she understand Sarah&#x27;s chronic complaining.</p>
<p>Hard times were already in the neighborhood, where lived the</p>
<p>families of the shopmen who had gone out on strike. Among the</p>
<p>small storekeepers, Saxon, in the course of the daily marketing,</p>
<p>could sense the air of despondency. Light and geniality seemed to</p>
<p>have vanished. Gloom pervaded everywhere. The mothers of the</p>
<p>children that played in the streets showed the gloom plainly in</p>
<p>their faces. When they gossiped in the evenings, over front gates</p>
<p>and on door stoops, their voices were subdued and less of</p>
<p>laughter rang out.</p>
<p>Mary Donahue, who had taken three pints from the milkman, now</p>
<p>took one pint. There were no more family trips to the moving</p>
<p>picture shows. Scrap-meat was harder to get from the butcher.</p>
<p>Nora Delaney, in the third house, no longer bought fresh fish for</p>
<p>Friday. Salted codfish, not of the best quality, was now on her</p>
<p>table. The sturdy children that ran out upon the street between</p>
<p>meals with huge slices of bread and butter and sugar now came out</p>
<p>with no sugar and with thinner slices spread more thinly with</p>
<p>butter. The very custom was dying out, and some children already</p>
<p>had desisted from piecing between meals.</p>
<p>Everywhere was manifest a pinching and scraping, a tightenig and</p>
<p>shortening down of expenditure. And everywhere was more</p>
<p>irritation. Women became angered with one another, and with the</p>
<p>children, more quickly than of yore; and Saxon knew that Bert and</p>
<p>Mary bickered incessantly.</p>
<p>&quot;If she&#x27;d only realize I&#x27;ve got troubles of my own,&quot; Bert</p>
<p>complained to Saxon.</p>
<p>She looked at him closely, and felt fear for him in a vague, numb</p>
<p>way. His black eyes seemed to burn with a continuous madness. The</p>
<p>brown face was leaner, the skin drawn tightly across the</p>
<p>cheekbones. A slight twist had come to the mouth, which seemed</p>
<p>frozen into bitterness. The very carriage of his body and the way</p>
<p>he wore his hat advertised a recklessness more intense than had</p>
<p>been his in the past.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the long afternoons, sitting by the window with</p>
<p>idle hands, she caught herself reconstructing in her vision that</p>
<p>folk-migration of her people across the plains and mountains and</p>
<p>deserts to the sunset land by the Western sea. And often she</p>
<p>found herself dreaming of the arcadian days of her people, when</p>
<p>they had not lived in cities nor been vexed with labor unions and</p>
<p>employers&#x27; associations. She would remember the old people&#x27;s</p>
<p>tales of self-sufficingness, when they shot or raised their own</p>
<p>meat, grew their own vegetables, were their own blacksmiths and</p>
<p>carpenters, made their own shoes--yes, and spun the cloth of the</p>
<p>clothes they wore. And something of the wistfulness in Tom&#x27;s face</p>
<p>she could see as she recollected it when he talked of his dream</p>
<p>of taking up government land.</p>
<p>A farmer&#x27;s life must be fine, she thought. Why was it that people</p>
<p>had to live in cities? Why had times changed? If there had been</p>
<p>enough in the old days, why was there not enough now? Why was it</p>
<p>necessary for men to quarrel and jangle, and strike and fight,</p>
<p>all about the matter of getting work? Why wasn&#x27;t there work for</p>
<p>all?--Only that morning, and she shuddered with the recollection,</p>
<p>she had seen two scabs, on their way to work, beaten up by the</p>
<p>strikers, by men she knew by sight, and some by name, who lived</p>
<p>in the neighhorhood. It had happened directly across the street.</p>
<p>It had been cruel, terrible--a dozen men on two. The children had</p>
<p>begun it by throwing rocks at the scabs and cursing them in ways</p>
<p>children should not know. Policemen had run upon the scene with</p>
<p>drawn revolvers, and the strikers had retreated into the houses</p>
<p>and through the narrow alleys between the houses. One of the</p>
<p>scabs, unconscious, had been carried away in an ambulance; the</p>
<p>other, assisted by special railroad police, had been taken away</p>
<p>to the shops. At him, Mary Donahue, standing on her front stoop,</p>
<p>her child in her arms, had hurled such vile abuse that it had</p>
<p>brought the blush of shame to Saxon&#x27;s cheeks. On the stoop of the</p>
<p>house on the other side, Saxon had noted Mercedes, in the height</p>
<p>of the beating up, looking on with a queer smile. She had seemed</p>
<p>very eager to witness, her nostrils dilated and swelling like the</p>
<p>beat of pulses as she watched. It had struck Saxon at the time</p>
<p>that the old woman was quite unalarmed and only curious to see.</p>
<p>To Mercedes, who was so wise in love, Saxon went for explanation</p>
<p>of what was the matter with the world. But the old woman&#x27;s wisdom</p>
<p>in affairs industrial and economic was cryptic and unpalatable.</p>
<p>&quot;La la, my dear, it is so simple. Most men are born stupid. They</p>
<p>are the slaves. A few are born clever. They are the masters. God</p>
<p>made men so, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then how about God and that terrible beating across the street</p>
<p>this morning?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid he was not interested,&quot; Mercedes smiled. &quot;I doubt he</p>
<p>even knows that it happened.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was frightened to death,&quot; Saxon declared. &quot;I was made sick by</p>
<p>it. And yet you--I saw you--you looked on as cool as you please,</p>
<p>as if it was a show.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a show, my dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, how could you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;La la, I have seen men killed. It is nothing strange. All men</p>
<p>die. The stupid ones die like oxen, they know not why. It is</p>
<p>quite funny to see. They strike each other with fists and clubs,</p>
<p>and break each other&#x27;s heads. It is gross. They are like a lot of</p>
<p>animals. They are like dogs wrangling over bones. Jobs are bones,</p>
<p>you know. Now, if they fought for women, or ideas, or bars of</p>
<p>gold, or fabulous diamonds, it would be splendid. But no; they</p>
<p>are only hungry, and fight over scraps for their stomach.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, if I could only understand!&quot; Saxon murmured, her hands</p>
<p>tightly clasped in anguish of incomprehension and vital need to</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing to understand. It is clear as print. There have</p>
<p>always been the stupid and the clever, the slave and the master,</p>
<p>the peasant and the prince. There always will be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why is a peasant a peasant, my dear? Because he is a peasant.</p>
<p>Why is a flea a flea?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon tossed her head fretfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but my dear, I have answered. The philosophies of the world</p>
<p>can give no better answer. Why do you like your man for a husband</p>
<p>rather than any other man? Because you like him that way, that is</p>
<p>all. Why do you like? Because you like. Why does fire burn and</p>
<p>frost bite? Why are there clever men and stupid men? masters and</p>
<p>slaves? employers and workingmen? Why is black black? Answer that</p>
<p>and you answer everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it is not right That men should go hungry and without work</p>
<p>when they want to work if only they can get a square deal,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>protested.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but it is right, just as it is right that stone won&#x27;t burn</p>
<p>like wood, that sea sand isn&#x27;t sugar, that thorns prick, that</p>
<p>water is wet, that smoke rises, that things fall down and not</p>
<p>up.&quot;</p>
<p>But such doctrine of reality made no impression on Saxon.</p>
<p>Frankly, she could not comprehend. It seemed like so much</p>
<p>nonsense.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we have no liberty and independence,&quot; she cried</p>
<p>passionately. &quot;One man is not as good as another. My child has</p>
<p>not the right to live that a rich mother&#x27;s child has.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly not,&quot; Mercedes answered.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet all my people fought for these things,&quot; Saxon urged,</p>
<p>remembering her school history and the sword of her father.</p>
<p>&quot;Democracy--the dream of the stupid peoples. Oh, la la, my dear,</p>
<p>democracy is a lie, an enchantment to keep the work brutes</p>
<p>content, just as religion used to keep them content. When they</p>
<p>groaned in their misery and toil, they were persuaded to keep on</p>
<p>in their misery and toil by pretty tales of a land beyond the</p>
<p>skies where they would live famously and fat while the clever</p>
<p>ones roasted in everlasting fire. Ah, how the clever ones must</p>
<p>have chuckled! And when that lie wore out, and democracy was</p>
<p>dreamed, the clever ones saw to it that it should be in truth a</p>
<p>dream, nothing but a dream. The world belongs to the great and</p>
<p>clever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you are of the working people,&quot; Saxon charged.</p>
<p>The old woman drew herself up, and almost was angry.</p>
<p>&quot;I? Of the working people? My dear, because I had misfortune with</p>
<p>moneys invested, because I am old and can no longer win the brave</p>
<p>young men, because I have outlived the men of my youth and there</p>
<p>is no one to go to, because I live here in the ghetto with Barry</p>
<p>Higgins and prepare to die--why, my dear, I was born with the</p>
<p>masters, and have trod all my days on the necks of the stupid. I</p>
<p>have drunk rare wines and sat at feasts that would have supported</p>
<p>this neighborhood for a lifetime. Dick Golden and I--it was</p>
<p>Dickie&#x27;s money, but I could have had it Dick Golden and I dropped</p>
<p>four hundred thousand francs in a week&#x27;s play at Monte Carlo. He</p>
<p>was a Jew, but he was a spender. In India I have worn jewels that</p>
<p>could have saved the lives of ten thousand families dying before</p>
<p>my eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You saw them die? ... and did nothing?&quot; Saxon asked aghast.</p>
<p>&quot;I kept my jewels--la la, and was robbed of them by a brute of a</p>
<p>Russian officer within the year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you let them die,&quot; Saxon reiterated.</p>
<p>&quot;They were cheap spawn. They fester and multiply like maggots.</p>
<p>They meant nothing--nothing, my dear, nothing. No more than your</p>
<p>work people mean here, whose crowning stupidity is their</p>
<p>continuing to beget more stupid spawn for the slavery of the</p>
<p>masters.&quot;</p>
<p>So it was that while Saxon could get little glimmering of common</p>
<p>sense from others, from the terrible old woman she got none at</p>
<p>all. Nor could Saxon bring herself to believe much of what she</p>
<p>considered Mercedes&#x27; romancing. As the weeks passed, the strike</p>
<p>in the railroad shops grew bitter and deadly. Billy shook his</p>
<p>head and confessed his inability to make head or tail of the</p>
<p>troubles that were looming on the labor horizon.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t get the hang of it,&quot; he told Saxon. &quot;It&#x27;s a mix-up. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>like a roughhouse with the lights out. Look at us teamsters. Here</p>
<p>we are, the talk just starting of going out on sympathetic strike</p>
<p>for the mill-workers. They&#x27;ve ben out a week, most of their</p>
<p>places is filled, an&#x27; if us teamsters keep on haulin&#x27; the</p>
<p>mill-work the strike&#x27;s lost.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet you didn&#x27;t consider striking for yourselves when your wages</p>
<p>were cut,&quot; Saxon said with a frown.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, we wasn&#x27;t in position then. But now the Frisco teamsters and</p>
<p>the whole Frisco Water Front Confederation is liable to back us</p>
<p>up. Anyway, we&#x27;re just talkin&#x27; about it, that&#x27;s all. But if we do</p>
<p>go out, we&#x27;ll try to get back that ten per cent cut.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s rotten politics,&quot; he said another time. &quot;Everybody&#x27;s</p>
<p>rotten. If we&#x27;d only wise up and agree to pick out honest men--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But if you, and Bert, and Tom can&#x27;t agree, how do you expect all</p>
<p>the rest to agree?&quot; Saxon asked.</p>
<p>&quot;It gets me,&quot; he admitted. &quot;It&#x27;s enough to give a guy the willies</p>
<p>thinkin&#x27; about it. And yet it&#x27;s plain as the nose on your face.</p>
<p>Get honest men for politics, an&#x27; the whole thing&#x27;s straightened</p>
<p>out. Honest men&#x27;d make honest laws, an&#x27; then honest men&#x27;d get</p>
<p>their dues. But Bert wants to smash things, an&#x27; Tom smokes his</p>
<p>pipe and dreams pipe dreams about by an&#x27; by when everybody votes</p>
<p>the way he thinks. But this by an&#x27; by ain&#x27;t the point. We want</p>
<p>things now. Tom says we can&#x27;t get them now, an&#x27; Bert says we</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t never goin&#x27; to get them. What can a fellow do when</p>
<p>everybody&#x27;s of different minds? Look at the socialists</p>
<p>themselves. They&#x27;re always disagreeing, splittin&#x27; up, an&#x27; firin&#x27;</p>
<p>each other out of the party. The whole thing&#x27;s bughouse, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>what, an&#x27; I almost get dippy myself thinkin&#x27; about it. The point</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t get out of my mind is that we want things now.&quot;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly and stared at Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; he asked, his voice husky with anxiety. &quot;You ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>sick ... or .. or anything?&quot;</p>
<p>One hand she had pressed to her heart; but the startle and fright</p>
<p>in her eyes was changing into a pleased intentness, while on her</p>
<p>mouth was a little mysterious smile. She seemed oblivious to her</p>
<p>husband, as if listening to some message from afar and not for</p>
<p>his ears. Then wonder and joy transfused her face, and she looked</p>
<p>at Billy, and her hand went out to his.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s life,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I felt life. I am so glad, so glad.&quot;</p>
<p>The next evening when Billy came home from work, Saxon caused him</p>
<p>to know and undertake more of the responsibilities of fatherhood.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking it over, Billy,&quot; she began, &quot;and I&#x27;m such a</p>
<p>healthy, strong woman that it won&#x27;t have to be very expensive.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s Martha Skelton--she&#x27;s a good midwife.&quot;</p>
<p>But Billy shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothin&#x27; doin&#x27; in that line, Saxon. You&#x27;re goin&#x27; to have Doc</p>
<p>Hentley. He&#x27;s Bill Murphy&#x27;s doc, an&#x27; Bill swears by him. He&#x27;s an</p>
<p>old cuss, but he&#x27;s a wooz.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She confined Maggie Donahue,&quot; Saxon argued; &quot;and look at her and</p>
<p>her baby.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, she won&#x27;t confine you--not so as you can notice it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the doctor will charge twenty dollars,&quot; Saxon pursued, &quot;and</p>
<p>make me get a nurse because I haven&#x27;t any womenfolk to come in.</p>
<p>But Martha Skelton would do everything, and it would be so much</p>
<p>cheaper.&quot;</p>
<p>But Billy gathered her tenderly in his arms and laid down the</p>
<p>law.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to me, little wife. The Roberts family ain&#x27;t on the</p>
<p>cheap. Never forget that. You&#x27;ve gotta have the baby. That&#x27;s your</p>
<p>business, an&#x27; it&#x27;s enough for you. My business is to get the</p>
<p>money an&#x27; take care of you. An&#x27; the best ain&#x27;t none too good for</p>
<p>you. Why, I wouldn&#x27;t run the chance of the teeniest accident</p>
<p>happenin&#x27; to you for a million dollars. It&#x27;s you that counts. An&#x27;</p>
<p>dollars is dirt. Maybe you think I like that kid some. I do. Why,</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t get him outa my head. I&#x27;m thinkin&#x27; about&#x27;m all day long.</p>
<p>If I get fired, it&#x27;ll be his fault. I&#x27;m clean dotty over him. But</p>
<p>just the same, Saxon, honest to God, before I&#x27;d have anything</p>
<p>happen to you, break your little finger, even, I&#x27;d see him dead</p>
<p>an&#x27; buried first. That&#x27;ll give you something of an idea what you</p>
<p>mean to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, Saxon, I had the idea that when folks got married they just</p>
<p>settled down, and after a while their business was to get along</p>
<p>with each other. Maybe it&#x27;s the way it is with other people; but</p>
<p>it ain&#x27;t that way with you an&#x27; me. I love you more &#x27;n more every</p>
<p>day. Right now I love you more&#x27;n when I began talkin&#x27; to you five</p>
<p>minutes ago. An&#x27; you won&#x27;t have to get a nurse. Doc Hentley&#x27;ll</p>
<p>come every day, an&#x27; Mary&#x27;ll come in an&#x27; do the housework, an&#x27;</p>
<p>take care of you an&#x27; all that, just as you&#x27;ll do for her if she</p>
<p>ever needs it.&quot;</p>
<p>As the days and weeks pussed, Saxon was possessed by a conscious</p>
<p>feeling of proud motherhood in her swelling breasts. So</p>
<p>essentially a normal woman was she, that motherhood was a</p>
<p>satisfying and passionate happiness. It was true that she had her</p>
<p>moments of apprehension, but they were so momentary and faint</p>
<p>that they tended, if anything, to give zest to her happiness.</p>
<p>Only one thing troubled her, and that was the puzzling and</p>
<p>perilous situation of labor which no one seemed to understand,</p>
<p>her self least of all.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;re always talking about how much more is made by machinery</p>
<p>than by the old ways,&quot; she told her brother Tom. &quot;Then, with all</p>
<p>the machinery we&#x27;ve got now, why don&#x27;t we get more?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now you&#x27;re talkin&#x27;,&quot; he answered. &quot;It wouldn&#x27;t take you long to</p>
<p>understand socialism.&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon had a mind to the immediate need of things.</p>
<p>&quot;Tom, how long have you been a socialist?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eight years.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you haven&#x27;t got anything by it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we will ... in time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At that rate you&#x27;ll be dead first,&quot; she challenged.</p>
<p>Tom sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid so. Things move so slow.&quot;</p>
<p>Again he sighed. She noted the weary, patient look in his face,</p>
<p>the bent shoulders, the labor-gnarled hands, and it all seemed to</p>
<p>symbolize the futility of his social creed.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>It began quietly, as the fateful unexpected so often begins.</p>
<p>Children, of all ages and sizes, were playing in the street, and</p>
<p>Saxon, by the open front window, was watching them and dreaming</p>
<p>day dreams of her child soon to be. The sunshine mellowed</p>
<p>peacefully down, and a light wind from the bay cooled the air and</p>
<p>gave to it a tang of salt. One of the children pointed up Pine</p>
<p>Street toward Seventh. All the children ceased playing, and</p>
<p>stared and pointed. They formed into groups, the larger boys, of</p>
<p>from ten to twelve, by themselves, the older girls anxiously</p>
<p>clutching the small children by the hands or gathering them into</p>
<p>their arms.</p>
<p>Saxon could not see the cause of all this, but she could guess</p>
<p>when she saw the larger boys rush to the gutter, pick up stones,</p>
<p>and sneak into the alleys between the houses. Smaller boys tried</p>
<p>to imitate them. The girls, dragging the tots by the arms, banged</p>
<p>gates and clattered up the front steps of the small houses. The</p>
<p>doors slammed behind them, and the street was deserted, though</p>
<p>here and there front shades were drawn aside so that</p>
<p>anxious-faced women might peer forth. Saxon heard the uptown</p>
<p>train puffing and snorting as it pulled out from Center Street.</p>
<p>Then, from the direction of Seventh, came a hoarse, throaty</p>
<p>manroar. Still, she could see nothing, and she remembered</p>
<p>Mercedes Higgins&#x27; words &quot;THEY ARE LIKE DOGS WRANGLING OVER BONES.</p>
<p>JOBS ARE BONES, YOU KNOW&quot;</p>
<p>The roar came closer, and Saxon, leaning out, saw a dozen scabs,</p>
<p>conveyed by as many special police and Pinkertons, coming down</p>
<p>the sidewalk on her side of tho street. They came compactly, as</p>
<p>if with discipline, while behind, disorderly, yelling confusedly,</p>
<p>stooping to pick up rocks, were seventy-five or a hundred of the</p>
<p>striking shopmen. Saxon discovered herself trembling with</p>
<p>apprehension, knew that she must not, and controlled herself. She</p>
<p>was helped in this by the conduct of Mercedes Higgins. The o]d</p>
<p>woman came out of her front door, dragging a chair, on which she</p>
<p>coolly seated herself on the tiny stoop at the top of the steps.</p>
<p>In the hands of the special police were clubs. The Pinkertons</p>
<p>carried no visible weapons. The strikers, urging on from behind,</p>
<p>seemed content with yelling their rage and threats, and it</p>
<p>remained for the children to precipitate the conflict. From</p>
<p>across the street, between the Olsen and the Isham houses, came a</p>
<p>shower of stones. Most of these fell short, though one struck a</p>
<p>scab on the head. The man was no more than twenty feet away from</p>
<p>Saxon. He reeled toward her front picket fence, drawing a</p>
<p>revolver. With one hand he brushed the blood from his eyes and</p>
<p>with the other he discharged the revolver into the Isham house. A</p>
<p>Pinkerton seized his arm to prevent a second shot, and dragged</p>
<p>him along. At the same instant a wilder roar went up from the</p>
<p>strikers, while a volley of stones came from between Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>house and Maggie Donahue&#x27;s. The scabs and their protectors made a</p>
<p>stand, drawing revolvers. From their hard, determined</p>
<p>faces--fighting men by profession--Saxon could augur nothing but</p>
<p>bloodshed and death. An elderly man, evidently the leader, lifted</p>
<p>a soft felt hat and mopped the perspiration from the bald top of</p>
<p>his head. He was a large man, very rotund of belly and helpless</p>
<p>looking. His gray beard was stained with streaks of tobacco</p>
<p>juice, and he was smoking a cigar. He was stoop-shouldered, and</p>
<p>Saxon noted the dandruff on the collar of his coat,</p>
<p>One of the men pointed into the street, and several of his</p>
<p>companions laughed. The cause of it was the little Olsen boy,</p>
<p>barely four years old, escaped somehow from his mother and</p>
<p>toddling toward his economic enemies. In his right he bore a rock</p>
<p>so heavy that he could scarcely lift it. With this he feebly</p>
<p>threatened them. His rosy little face was convulsed with rage,</p>
<p>and he was screaming over and over &quot;Dam scabs! Dam scabs! Dam</p>
<p>scabs!&quot; The laughter with which they greeted him only increased</p>
<p>his fury. He toddled closer, and with a mighty exertion threw the</p>
<p>rock, It fell a scant six feet beyond his hand.</p>
<p>This much Saxon saw, and also Mrs. Olsen rushing into the street</p>
<p>for her child. A rattling of revolver-shots from the strikers</p>
<p>drew Saxon&#x27;s attention to the men beneath her. One of them cursed</p>
<p>sharply and examined the biceps of his left arm, which hung</p>
<p>limply by his side, Down the hand she saw the blood beginning to</p>
<p>drip. She knew she ought not remain and watch, but the memory of</p>
<p>her fighting forefathers was with her, while she possessed no</p>
<p>more than normal human fear--if anything, less. She forgot her</p>
<p>child in the eruption of battle that had broken upon her quiet</p>
<p>street, And she forgot the strikers, and everything else, in</p>
<p>amazement at what had happened to the round-bellied,</p>
<p>cigar-smoking leader. In some strange way, she knew not how, his</p>
<p>head had become wedged at the neck between the tops of the</p>
<p>pickets of her fence. His body hung down outside, the knees not</p>
<p>quite touching the ground. His hat had fallen off, and the sun</p>
<p>was making an astounding high light on his bald spot. The cigar,</p>
<p>too, was gone. She saw he was looking at her. One hand, between</p>
<p>the pickets, seemed waving at her, and almost he seemed to wink</p>
<p>at her jocosely, though she knew it to be the contortion of</p>
<p>deadly pain.</p>
<p>Possibly a second, or, at most, two seconds, she gazed at this,</p>
<p>when she was aroused by Bert&#x27;s voice. He was running along the</p>
<p>sidewMk, in front of her house, and behind him charged several</p>
<p>more strikers, while he shouted: &quot;Come on, you Mohegans! We got</p>
<p>&#x27;em nailed to the cross!&quot;</p>
<p>In his left hand he carried a pick-handle, in his right a</p>
<p>revolver, already empty, for he clicked the cylinder vainly</p>
<p>around as he ran. With an abrupt stop, dropping the pick-handle,</p>
<p>he whirled half about, facing Saxon&#x27;s gate. He was sinking down,</p>
<p>when he straightened himself to throw the revolver into the face</p>
<p>of a scab who was jumping toward him. Then he began swaying, at</p>
<p>the same time sagging at the knees and waist. Slowly, with</p>
<p>infinite effort, he caught a gate picket in his right hand, and,</p>
<p>still slowly, as if lowering himself, sank down, while past him</p>
<p>leaped the crowd of strikers he had led.</p>
<p>It was battle without quarter--a massacre. The scabs and their</p>
<p>protectors, surrounded, backed against Saxon&#x27;s fence, fought like</p>
<p>cornered rats, but could not withstand the rush of a hundred men.</p>
<p>Clubs and pick-handles were swinging, revolvers were exploding,</p>
<p>and cobblestones were flung with crushing effect at arm&#x27;s</p>
<p>distance. Saxon saw young Frank Davis, a friend of Bert&#x27;s and a</p>
<p>father of several months&#x27; standing, press the muzzle of his</p>
<p>revolver against a scab&#x27;s stomach and fire. There were curses and</p>
<p>snarls of rage, wild cries of terror and pain. Mercedes was</p>
<p>right. These things were not men. They were beasts, fighting over</p>
<p>bones, destroying one another for bones.</p>
<p>JOBS ARE BONES; JOBS ARE BONES. The phrase was an incessant</p>
<p>iteration in Saxon&#x27;s brain. Much as she might have wished it, she</p>
<p>was powerless now to withdraw from the window. It was as if she</p>
<p>were paralyzed. Her brain no longer worked. She sat numb,</p>
<p>staring, incapable of anything save seeing the rapid horror</p>
<p>before her eyes that flashed along like a moving picture film</p>
<p>gone mad. She saw Pinkertons, special police, and strikers go</p>
<p>down. One scab, terribly wounded, on his knees and begging for</p>
<p>mercy, was kicked in the face. As he sprawled backward another</p>
<p>striker, standing over him, fired a revolver into his chest,</p>
<p>quickly and deliberately, again and again, until the weapon was</p>
<p>empty. Another scab, backed over the pickets by a hand clutching</p>
<p>his throat, had his face pulped by a revolver butt. Again and</p>
<p>again, continually, the revolver rose and fell, and Saxon knew</p>
<p>the man who wielded it--Chester Johnson. She had met him at</p>
<p>dances and danced with him in the days before she was married. He</p>
<p>had always been kind and good natured. She remembered the Friday</p>
<p>night, after a City Hall band concert, when he had taken her and</p>
<p>two other girls to Tony&#x27;s Tamale Grotto on Thirteenth street. And</p>
<p>after that they had all gone to Pabst&#x27;s Cafe and drunk a glass of</p>
<p>beer before they went home. It was impossible that this could be</p>
<p>the same Chester Johnson. And as she looked, she saw the</p>
<p>round-bellied leader, still wedged by the neck between the</p>
<p>pickets, draw a revolver with his free hand, and, squinting</p>
<p>horribly sidewise, press the muzzle against Chester&#x27;s side. She</p>
<p>tried to scream a warning. She did scream, and Chester looked up</p>
<p>and saw her. At that moment the revolver went off, and he</p>
<p>collapsed prone upon the body of the scab. And the bodies of</p>
<p>three men hung on her picket fence.</p>
<p>Anything could happen now. Quite without surprise, she saw the</p>
<p>strikers leaping the fence, trampling her few little geraniums</p>
<p>and pansies into the earth as they fled between Mercedes&#x27; house</p>
<p>and hers. Up Pine street, from the railroad yards, was coming a</p>
<p>rush of railroad police and Pinkertons, firing as they ran. While</p>
<p>down Pine street, gongs clanging, horses at a gallop, came three</p>
<p>patrol wagons packed with police. The strikers were in a trap.</p>
<p>The only way out was between the houses and over the back yard</p>
<p>fences. The jam in the narrow alley prevented them all from</p>
<p>escaping. A dozen were cornered in the angle between the front of</p>
<p>her house and the steps. And as they had done, so were they done</p>
<p>by. No effort was made to arrest. They were clubbed down and shot</p>
<p>down to the last man by the guardians of the peace who were</p>
<p>infuriated by what had been wreaked on their brethren.</p>
<p>It was all over, and Saxon, moving as in a dream, clutching the</p>
<p>banister tightly, came down the front steps. The round-bellied</p>
<p>leader still leered at her and fluttered one hand, though two big</p>
<p>policemen were just bending to extricate him. The gate was off</p>
<p>its hinges, which seemed strange, for she had been watching all</p>
<p>the time and had not seen it happen.</p>
<p>Bert&#x27;s eyes were closed. His lips were blood-flecked, and there</p>
<p>was a gurgling in his throat as if he were trying to say</p>
<p>something. As she stooped above him, with her handkerchief</p>
<p>brushing the blood from his cheek where some one had stepped on</p>
<p>him, his eyes opened. The old defiant light was in them. He did</p>
<p>not know her. The lips moved, and faintly, almout reminiscently,</p>
<p>he murmured, &quot;The last of the Mohegans, the last of the</p>
<p>Mohegans.&quot; Then he groaned, and the eyelids drooped down again.</p>
<p>He was not dead. She knew that, The chest still rose and fell,</p>
<p>and the gurgling still continued in his throat.</p>
<p>She looked up. Mercedes stood beside her. The old woman&#x27;s eyes</p>
<p>were very bright, her withered cheeks flushed.</p>
<p>&quot;Will you help me carry him into the house?&quot; Saxon asked.</p>
<p>Mercedes nodded, turned to a sergeant of police, and made the</p>
<p>request to him. The sergeant gave a swift glance at Bert, and his</p>
<p>eyes were bitter and ferocious as he refused.</p>
<p>&quot;To hell with&#x27;m. We&#x27;ll care for our own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you and I can do it,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t be a fool.&quot; Mercedes was beckoning to Mrs. Olsen across</p>
<p>the street. &quot;You go into the house, little mother that is to be.</p>
<p>This is bad for you. We&#x27;ll carry him in. Mrs. Olsen is coming,</p>
<p>and we&#x27;ll get Maggie Donahue.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon led the way into the back bedroom which Billy had insisted</p>
<p>on furnishing. As she opened the door, the carpet seemed to fly</p>
<p>up into her face as with the force of a blow, for she remembered</p>
<p>Bert had laid that carpet. And as the women placed him on the bed</p>
<p>she recalled that it was Bert and she, between them, who had set</p>
<p>the bed up one Sunday morning.</p>
<p>And then she felt very queer, and was surprised to see Mercedes</p>
<p>regarding her with questioning, searching eyes. After that her</p>
<p>queerness came on very fast, and she descended into the hell of</p>
<p>pain that is given to women alone to know. She was supported,</p>
<p>half-carried, to the front bedroom. Many faces were about</p>
<p>her--Mercedes, Mrs. Olsen, Maggie Donahue. It seemed she must ask</p>
<p>Mrs. Olsen if she had saved little Emil from the street, but</p>
<p>Mercedes cleared Mrs. Olsen out to look after Bert, and Maggie</p>
<p>Donahue went to answer a knock at the front door. From the street</p>
<p>came a loud hum of voices, punctuated by shouts and commands, and</p>
<p>from time to time there was a clanging of the gongs of ambulances</p>
<p>and patrol wagon&#x27;s. Then appeared the fat, comfortable face of</p>
<p>Martha Shelton, and, later, Dr. Hentley came. Once, in a clear</p>
<p>interval, through the thin wall Saxon heard the high opening</p>
<p>notes of Mary&#x27;s hysteria. And, another time, she heard Mary</p>
<p>repeating over and over. &quot;I&#x27;ll never go back to the laundry.</p>
<p>Never. Never.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER X</p>
<p>Billy could never get over the shock, during that period, of</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s appearance. Morning after morning, and evening after</p>
<p>evening when he came home from work, he would enter the room</p>
<p>where she lay and fight a royal battle to hide his feelings and</p>
<p>make a show of cheerfulness and geniality. She looked so small</p>
<p>lying there so small and shrunken and weary, and yet so</p>
<p>child-like in her smallness. Tenderly, as he sat beside her, he</p>
<p>would take up her pale hand and stroke the slim, transparent arm,</p>
<p>marveling at the smallness and delicacy of the bones.</p>
<p>One of her first questions, puzzling alike to Billy and Mary,</p>
<p>was:</p>
<p>&quot;Did they save little Emil Olsen?&quot;</p>
<p>And when she told them how he had attacked, singlehanded, the</p>
<p>whole twenty-four fighting men, Billy&#x27;s face glowed with</p>
<p>appreciation.</p>
<p>&quot;The little cuss!&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s the kind of a kid to be proud</p>
<p>of.&quot;</p>
<p>He halted awkwardly, and his very evident fear that he had hurt</p>
<p>her touched Saxon. She put her hand out to his.</p>
<p>&quot;Billy,&quot; she began; then waited till Mary left the room.</p>
<p>&quot;I never asked before--not that it matters ... now. But I waited</p>
<p>for you to tell me. Was it ... ?&quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;No; it was a girl. A perfect little girl. Only ... it was too</p>
<p>soon.&quot;</p>
<p>She pressed his hand, and almost it was she that sympathized with</p>
<p>him in his affliction.</p>
<p>&quot;I never told you, Billy--you were so set on a boy; but I</p>
<p>planned, just the same, if it was a girl, to call her Daisy. You</p>
<p>remember, that was my mother&#x27;s name.&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded his approbation.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon, you know I did want a boy like the very dickens ...</p>
<p>well, I don&#x27;t care now. I think I&#x27;m set just as hard on a girl,</p>
<p>an&#x27;, well, here&#x27;s hopin&#x27; the next will be called ... you wouldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>mind, would you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If we called it the same name, Daisy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Billy! I was thinking the very same thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Then his face grew stern as he went on.</p>
<p>&quot;Only there ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to be a next. I didn&#x27;t know what havin&#x27;</p>
<p>children was like before. You can&#x27;t run any more risks like</p>
<p>that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hear the big, strong, afraid-man talk!&quot; she jeered, with a wan</p>
<p>smile. &quot;You don&#x27;t know anything about it. How can a man? I am a</p>
<p>healthy, natural woman. Everything would have been all right this</p>
<p>time if ... if all that fighting hadn&#x27;t happened. Where did they</p>
<p>bury Bert?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You knew?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All the time. And where is Mercedes? She hasn&#x27;t been in for two</p>
<p>days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Old Barry&#x27;s sick. She&#x27;s with him.&quot;</p>
<p>He did not tell her that the old night watchman was dying, two</p>
<p>thin walls and half a dozen feet away.</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s lips were trembling, and she began to cry weakly,</p>
<p>clinging to Billy&#x27;s hand with both of hers.</p>
<p>&quot;I--I can&#x27;t help it,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I&#x27;ll be all right in a minute</p>
<p>... Our little girl, Billy. Think of it! And I never saw her!&quot;</p>
<p>She was still lying on her bed, when, one evening, Mary saw fit</p>
<p>to break out in bitter thanksgiving that she had escaped, and was</p>
<p>destined to escape, what Saxon had gone through.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, what are you talkin&#x27; about?&quot; Billy demanded. &quot;You&#x27;ll get</p>
<p>married some time again as sure as beans is beans.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not to the best man living,&quot; she proclaimed. &quot;And there ain&#x27;t no</p>
<p>call for it. There&#x27;s too many people in the world now, else why</p>
<p>are there two or three men for every job? And, besides, havin&#x27;</p>
<p>children is too terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon, with a look of patient wisdom in her face that became</p>
<p>glorified as she spoke, made answer:</p>
<p>&quot;I ought to know what it means. I&#x27;ve been through it, and I&#x27;m</p>
<p>still in the thick of it, and I want to say to you right now, out</p>
<p>of all the pain and the ache and the sorrow, that it is the most</p>
<p>beautiful, wonderful thing in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>As Saxon&#x27;s strength came back to her (and when Doctor Hentley had</p>
<p>privily assured Billy that she was sound as a dollar), she</p>
<p>herself took up the matter of the industrial tragedy that had</p>
<p>taken place before her door. The militia had been called out</p>
<p>immediately, Billy informed her, and was encamped then at the</p>
<p>foot of Pine street on the waste ground next to the railroad</p>
<p>yards. As for the strikers, fifteen of them were in jail. A house</p>
<p>to house search had been made in the neighborhood by the police,</p>
<p>and in this way nearly the whole fifteen, all wounded, had been</p>
<p>captured. It would go hard with them, Billy foreboded gloomily.</p>
<p>The newspapers were demanding blood for blood, and all the</p>
<p>ministers in Oakland had preached fierce sermons against the</p>
<p>strikers. The railroad had filled every place, and it was well</p>
<p>known that the striking shopmen not only would never get their</p>
<p>old jobs back but were blacklisted in every railroad in the</p>
<p>United States. Already they were beginning to scatter. A number</p>
<p>had gone to Panama, and four were talking of going to Ecuador to</p>
<p>work in the shops of the railroad that ran over the Andes to</p>
<p>Quito.</p>
<p>With anxiety keenly concealed, she tried to feel out Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>opinion on what had happened.</p>
<p>&quot;That shows what Bert&#x27;s violent methods come to,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>He shook his head slowly and gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;ll hang Chester Johnson, anyway,&quot; be answered indirectly.</p>
<p>&quot;You know him. You told me you used to dance with him. He was</p>
<p>caught red-handed, lyin&#x27; on the body of a scab he beat to death.</p>
<p>Old Jelly Belly&#x27;s got three bullet holes in him, but he ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>goin&#x27; to die, and he&#x27;s got Chester&#x27;s number. They&#x27;ll hang&#x27;m on</p>
<p>Jelly Belly&#x27;s evidence. It was all in the papers. Jelly Belly</p>
<p>shot him, too, a-hangin&#x27; by the neck on our pickets.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shuddered. Jelly Belly must be the man with the bald spot</p>
<p>and the tobacco-stained whiskers.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;I saw it all. It seemed he must have hung there</p>
<p>for hours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was all over, from first to last, in five minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seemed ages and ages.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess that&#x27;s the way it seemed to Jelly Belly, stuck on the</p>
<p>pickets,&quot; Billy smiled grimly. &quot;But he&#x27;s a hard one to kill. He&#x27;s</p>
<p>been shot an&#x27; cut up a dozen different times. But they say now</p>
<p>he&#x27;ll be crippled for life--have to go around on crutches, or in</p>
<p>a wheel-chair. That&#x27;ll stop him from doin&#x27; any more dirty work</p>
<p>for the railroad. He was one of their top gun-fighters--always up</p>
<p>to his ears in the thick of any fightin&#x27; that was goin&#x27; on. He</p>
<p>never was leery of anything on two feet, I&#x27;ll say that much</p>
<p>for&#x27;m.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where does he live?&quot; Saxon inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Up on Adeline, near Tenth--fine neighborhood an&#x27; fine</p>
<p>two-storied house. He must pay thirty dollars a month rent. I</p>
<p>guess the railroad paid him pretty well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then he must be married?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep. I never seen his wife, but he&#x27;s got one son, Jack, a</p>
<p>passenger engineer. I used to know him. He was a nifty boxer,</p>
<p>though he never went into the ring. An&#x27; he&#x27;s got another son</p>
<p>that&#x27;s teacher in the high school. His name&#x27;s Paul. We&#x27;re about</p>
<p>the same age. He was great at baseball. I knew him when we was</p>
<p>kids. He pitched me out three times hand-runnin&#x27; once, when the</p>
<p>Durant played the Cole School.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon sat back in the Morris chair, resting and thinking. The</p>
<p>problem was growing more complicated than ever. This elderly,</p>
<p>round-bellied, and bald-headed gunfighter, too, had a wife and</p>
<p>family. And there was Frank Davis, married barely a year and with</p>
<p>a baby boy. Perhaps the scab he shot in the stomach had a wife</p>
<p>and children. All seemed to be acquainted, members of a very</p>
<p>large family, and yet, because of their particular families, they</p>
<p>battered and killed each other. She had seen Chester Johnson kill</p>
<p>a scab, and now they were going to hang Chester Johnson, who had</p>
<p>married Kittie Brady out of the cannery, and she and Kittie Brady</p>
<p>had worked together years before in the paper box factory.</p>
<p>Vainly Saxon waked for Billy to say something that would show he</p>
<p>did not countenance the killing of the scabs.</p>
<p>&quot;It was wrong,&quot; she ventured finally.</p>
<p>&quot;They killed Bert,&quot; he countered. &quot;An&#x27; a lot of others. An&#x27; Frank</p>
<p>Davis. Did you know he was dead? Had his whole lower jaw shot</p>
<p>away--died in the ambulance before they could get him to the</p>
<p>receiving hospital. There was never so much killin&#x27; at one time</p>
<p>in Oakland before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it was their fault,&quot; she contended. &quot;They began it. It was</p>
<p>murder.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy did not reply, but she heard him mutter hoarsely. She knew</p>
<p>he said &quot;God damn them&quot;; but when she asked, &quot;What?&quot; he made no</p>
<p>answer. His eyes were deep with troubled clouds, while the mouth</p>
<p>had hardened, and all his face was bleak.</p>
<p>To her it was a heart-stab. Was he, too, like the rest? Would he</p>
<p>kill other men who had families, like Bert, and Frank Davis, and</p>
<p>Chester Johnson had killed? Was he, too, a wild beast, a dog that</p>
<p>would snarl over a bone?</p>
<p>She sighed. Life was a strange puzzle. Perhaps Mercedes Higgins</p>
<p>was right in her cruel statement of the terms of existence.</p>
<p>&quot;What of it,&quot; Billy laughed harshly, as if in answer to her</p>
<p>unuttered questions. &quot;It&#x27;s dog eat dog, I guess, and it&#x27;s always</p>
<p>ben that way. Take that scrap outside there. They killed each</p>
<p>other just like the North an&#x27; South did in the Civil War.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But workingmen can&#x27;t win that way, Billy. You say yourself that</p>
<p>it spoiled their chance of winning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose not,&quot; he admitted reluctantly. &quot;But what other chance</p>
<p>they&#x27;ve got to win I don&#x27;t see. Look at &#x27;us. We&#x27;ll be up against</p>
<p>it next.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not the teamsters?&quot; she cried.</p>
<p>He nodded gloomily.</p>
<p>&quot;The bosses are cuttin&#x27; loose all along the line for a high old</p>
<p>time. Say they&#x27;re goin&#x27; to beat us to our knees till we come</p>
<p>crawlin&#x27; back a-beggin&#x27; for our jobs. They&#x27;ve bucked up real high</p>
<p>an&#x27; mighty what of all that killin&#x27; the other day. Havin&#x27; the</p>
<p>troops out is half the fight, along with havin&#x27; the preachers an&#x27;</p>
<p>the papers an&#x27; the public behind &#x27;em. They&#x27;re shootin&#x27; off their</p>
<p>mouths already about what they&#x27;re goin&#x27; to do. They&#x27;re sure</p>
<p>gunning for trouble. First, they&#x27;re goin&#x27; to hang Chester Johnson</p>
<p>an&#x27; as many more of the fifteen as they can. They say that flat.</p>
<p>The Tribune, an&#x27; the Enquirer an&#x27; the Times keep sayin&#x27; it over</p>
<p>an over every day. They&#x27;re all union-hustin&#x27; to beat the band. No</p>
<p>more closed shop. To hell with organized labor. Why, the dirty</p>
<p>little Intelligencer come out this morning an&#x27; said that every</p>
<p>union official in Oakland ought to be run outa town or stretched</p>
<p>up. Fine, Eh? You bet it&#x27;s fine.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at us. It ain&#x27;t a case any more of sympathetic strike for</p>
<p>the mill-workers. We got our own troubles. They&#x27;ve fired our four</p>
<p>best men--the ones that was always on the conference committees.</p>
<p>Did it without cause. They&#x27;re lookin&#x27; for trouble, as I told you,</p>
<p>an&#x27; they&#x27;ll get it, too, if they don&#x27;t watch out. We got our tip</p>
<p>from the Frisco Water Front Confederation. With them backin&#x27; us</p>
<p>we&#x27;ll go some.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean you&#x27;ll ... strike?&quot; Saxon asked.</p>
<p>He bent his head.</p>
<p>&quot;But isn&#x27;t that what they want you to do?--from the way they&#x27;re</p>
<p>acting?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What &quot;s the difference?&quot; Billy shrugged his shoulders, then</p>
<p>continued. &quot;It&#x27;s better to strike than to get fired. We beat &#x27;em</p>
<p>to it, that&#x27;s all, an&#x27; we catch &#x27;em before they&#x27;re ready. Don&#x27;t</p>
<p>we know what they&#x27;re doin&#x27;? They&#x27;re collectin&#x27; gradin&#x27;-camp</p>
<p>drivers an&#x27; mule-skinners all up an&#x27; down the state. They got</p>
<p>forty of &#x27;em, feedin&#x27; &#x27;em in a hotel in Stockton right now, an&#x27;</p>
<p>ready to rush &#x27;em in on us an&#x27; hundreds more like &#x27;em. So this</p>
<p>Saturday&#x27;s the last wages I&#x27;ll likely bring home for some time.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon closed her eyes and thought quietly for five minutes. It</p>
<p>was not her way to take things excitedly. The coolness of poise</p>
<p>that Billy so admired never deserted her in time of emergency.</p>
<p>She realized that she herself was no more than a mote caught up</p>
<p>in this tangled, nonunderstandable conflict of many motes.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll have to draw from our savings to pay for this month&#x27;s</p>
<p>rent,&quot; she said brightly.</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s face fell.</p>
<p>&quot;We ain&#x27;t got as much in the bank as you think,&quot; he confessed.</p>
<p>&quot;Bert had to be buried, you know, an I coughed up what the others</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t raise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How much was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forty dollars. I was goin&#x27; to stand off the butcher an&#x27; the rest</p>
<p>for a while. They knew I was good pay. But they put it to me</p>
<p>straight. They&#x27;d been carryin&#x27; the shopmen right along an was up</p>
<p>against it themselves. An&#x27; now with that strike smashed they&#x27;re</p>
<p>pretty much smashed themselves. So I took it all out of the bank.</p>
<p>I knew you wouldn&#x27;t mind. You don&#x27;t, do you?&quot;</p>
<p>She smiled bravely, and bravely overcame the sinking feeling at</p>
<p>her heart.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the only right thing to do, Billy. I would have done it</p>
<p>if you were lying sick, and Bert would have done it for you an&#x27;</p>
<p>me if it had been the other way around.&quot;</p>
<p>His face was glowing.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee, Saxon, a fellow can always count on you. You&#x27;re like my</p>
<p>right hand. That&#x27;s why I say no more babies. If I lose you I&#x27;m</p>
<p>crippled for life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve got to economize,&quot; she mused, nodding her appreciation.</p>
<p>&quot;How much is in bank?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just about thirty dollars. You see, I had to pay Martha Skelton</p>
<p>an&#x27; for the ... a few other little things. An&#x27; the union took</p>
<p>time by the neck and levied a four dollar emergency assessment on</p>
<p>every member just to be ready if the strike was pulled off. But</p>
<p>Doc Hentley can wait. He said as much. He&#x27;s the goods, if anybody</p>
<p>should ask you. How&#x27;d you like&#x27;m?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I liked him. But I don&#x27;t know about doctors. He&#x27;s the first I</p>
<p>ever had--except when I was vaccinated once, and then the city</p>
<p>did that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like the street car men are goin&#x27; out, too. Dan Fallon&#x27;s</p>
<p>come to town. Came all the way from New York. Tried to sneak in</p>
<p>on the quiet, but the fellows knew when he left New York, an&#x27;</p>
<p>kept track of him all the way acrost. They have to. He&#x27;s</p>
<p>Johnny-on-the-Spot whenever street car men are licked into shape.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s won lots of street car strikes for tha bosses. Keeps an army</p>
<p>of strike breakers an&#x27; ships them all over the country on special</p>
<p>trains wherever they&#x27;re needed. Oakland&#x27;s never seen labor</p>
<p>troubles like she&#x27;s got and is goin&#x27; to get. All hell&#x27;s goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>break loose from the looks of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Watch out for yourself, then, Billy. I don&#x27;t want to lose you</p>
<p>either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, that&#x27;s all right. I can take care of myself. An&#x27; besides, it</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t as though we was licked. We got a good chance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you&#x27;ll lose if there is any killing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep; we gotta keep an eye out against that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No violence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No gun-fighting or dynamite,&quot; he assented. &quot;But a heap of</p>
<p>scabs&#x27;ll get their heads broke. That has to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you won&#x27;t do any of that, Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not so as any slob can testify before a court to havin&#x27; seen</p>
<p>me.&quot; Then, with a quick shift, he changed the subject. &quot;Old Barry</p>
<p>Higgins is dead. I didn&#x27;t want to tell you till you was outa bed.</p>
<p>Buried&#x27;m a week ago. An&#x27; the old woman&#x27;s movin&#x27; to Frisco. She</p>
<p>told me she&#x27;d be in to say good-bye. She stuck by you pretty well</p>
<p>them first couple of days, an&#x27; she showed Martha Shelton a few</p>
<p>that made her hair curl. She got Martha&#x27;s goat from the jump.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>With Billy on strike and away doing picket duty, and with the</p>
<p>departure of Mercedes and the death of Bert, Saxon was left much</p>
<p>to herself in a loneliness that even in one as healthy-minded as</p>
<p>she could not fail to produce morbidness. Mary, too, had left,</p>
<p>having spoken vaguely of taking a job at housework in Piedmont.</p>
<p>Billy could help Saxon little in her trouble. He dimly sansed her</p>
<p>suffering, without comprehending the scope and intensity of it.</p>
<p>He was too man-practical, and, by his very sex, too remote from</p>
<p>the intimate tragedy that was hers. He was an outsider at the</p>
<p>best, a friendly onlooker who saw little. To her the baby had</p>
<p>been quick and real. It was still quick and real. That was her</p>
<p>trouble. By no deliberate effort of will could she fill the</p>
<p>achiiig void of its absence. Its reality became, at times, an</p>
<p>hallucination. Somewhere it still was, and she must find it. She</p>
<p>would catch herself, on occasion, listening with strained ears</p>
<p>for the cry she had never heard, yet which, in fancy, she had</p>
<p>heard a thousand times in the happy months before the end. Twice</p>
<p>she left her bed in her sleep and went searching--each time</p>
<p>coming to herself beside her mother&#x27;s chest of drawers in which</p>
<p>were the tiny garments. To herself, at such moments, she would</p>
<p>say, &quot;I had a baby once.&quot; And she would say it, aloud, as she</p>
<p>watched the children playing in the street.</p>
<p>One day, on the Eighth street cars, a young mother sat beside</p>
<p>her, a crowing infant in her arms. And Saxon said to her:</p>
<p>&quot;I had a baby once. It died.&quot;</p>
<p>The mother looked at her, startled, half-drew the baby tighter in</p>
<p>her arms, jealously, or as if in fear; then she softened as she</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>&quot;You poor thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Saxon nodded. &quot;It died.&quot;</p>
<p>Tear&#x27;s welled into her eyes, and the telling of her grief seemed</p>
<p>to have brought relief. But all the day she suffered from an</p>
<p>almost overwhelming desire to recite her sorrow to the world--to</p>
<p>the paying teller at the bank, to the elderly floor-walker in</p>
<p>Salinger&#x27;s, to the blind woman, guided by a little boy, who</p>
<p>played on the concertina--to every one save the policeman. The</p>
<p>police were new and terrible creatures to her now. She had seen</p>
<p>them kill the strikers as mercilessly as the strikers had killed</p>
<p>the scabs. And, unlike the strikers, the police were professional</p>
<p>killers. They were not fighting for jobs. They did it as a</p>
<p>business. They could have taken prisoners that day, in the angle</p>
<p>of her front steps and the house. But they had not.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, whenever approaching one, she edged across the</p>
<p>sidewalk so as to get as far as possible away from him. She did</p>
<p>not reason it out, but deeper than consciousness was the feeling</p>
<p>that they were typical of something inimical to her and hers.</p>
<p>At Eighth and Broadway, waiting for her car to return home, the</p>
<p>policeman on the corner recognized her and greeted her. She</p>
<p>turned white to the lips, and her heart fluttered painfully. It</p>
<p>was only Ned Hermanmann, fatter, bronder-faced, jollier looking</p>
<p>than ever. He had sat across the aisle from her for three terms</p>
<p>at school. He and she had been monitors together of the</p>
<p>composition books for one term. The day the powder works blew up</p>
<p>at Pinole, breaking every window in the school, he and she had</p>
<p>not joined in the panic rush for out-of-doors. Both had remained</p>
<p>in the room, and the irate principal had exhibited them, from</p>
<p>room to room, to the cowardly classes, and then rewarded them</p>
<p>with a month&#x27;s holiday from school. And after that Ned Hermanmann</p>
<p>had become a policeman, and married Lena Highland, and Saxon had</p>
<p>heard they had five children.</p>
<p>But, in spite of all that, he was now a policeman, and Billy was</p>
<p>now a striker. Might not Ned Hermanmann some day club and shoot</p>
<p>Billy just as those other policemen clubbed and shot the strikers</p>
<p>by her front steps?</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the matter, Saxon?&quot; he asked. &quot;Sick?&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded and choked, unable to speak, and started to move</p>
<p>toward her car which was coming to a stop.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll help you,&quot; he offered.</p>
<p>She shrank away from his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;No; I&#x27;m all right,&quot; she gasped hurriedly. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to take</p>
<p>it. I&#x27;ve forgotten something.&quot;</p>
<p>She turned away dizzily, up Broadway to Ninth. Two blocks along</p>
<p>Ninth, she turned down Clay and back to Eighth street, where she</p>
<p>waited for another car.</p>
<p>As the summer months dragged along, the industrial situation in</p>
<p>Oakland grew steadily worse. Capital everywhere seemed to have</p>
<p>selected this city for the battle with organized labor. So many</p>
<p>men in Oakland were out on strike, or were locked out, or were</p>
<p>unable to work because of the dependence of their trades on the</p>
<p>other tied-up trade&#x27;s, that odd jobs at common labor were hard to</p>
<p>obtain. Billy occasionally got a day&#x27;s wdrk to do, but did not</p>
<p>earn enough to make both ends meet, despite the small strike</p>
<p>wages received at first, and despite the rigid economy he and</p>
<p>Saxon practiced.</p>
<p>The table she set had scarcely anything in common with that of</p>
<p>their first married year. Not alone was every item of cheaper</p>
<p>quality, but many items had disappeared. Meat, and the poorest,</p>
<p>was very seldom on the table. Cow&#x27;s milk had given place to</p>
<p>condensed milk, and even the sparing use of the latter had</p>
<p>ceased. A roll of butter, when they had it, lastad half a dozen</p>
<p>times as long as formerly. Where Billy had been used to drinking</p>
<p>three cups of coffee for breakfast, he now drank one. Saxon</p>
<p>boiled this coffee an atrocious length of time, and she paid</p>
<p>twenty cents a pound for it.</p>
<p>The blight of hard times was on all the neighborhood. The</p>
<p>families not involved in one strike were touched by some other</p>
<p>strike or by the cessation of work in some dependent trade. Many</p>
<p>single young men who were lodgers had drifted away, thus</p>
<p>increasing the house rent of the families which had sheltered</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>&quot;Gott!&quot; said the butcher to Saxon. &quot;We working class all suffer</p>
<p>together. My wife she cannot get her teeth fixed now. Pretty soon</p>
<p>I go smash broke maybe.&quot;</p>
<p>Once, when Billy was preparing to pawn his watch, Saxon suggested</p>
<p>his borrowing the money from Billy Murphy.</p>
<p>&quot;I was plannin&#x27; that,&quot; Billy answered, &quot;only I can&#x27;t now. I</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t tell you what happened Tuesday night at the Sporting Life</p>
<p>Club. You remember that squarehead Champion of the United States</p>
<p>Navy? Bill was matched with him, an&#x27; it was sure easy money. Bill</p>
<p>had &#x27;m goin&#x27; south by the end of the sixth round, an&#x27; at the</p>
<p>seventh went in to finish &#x27;m. And then--just his luck, for his</p>
<p>trade&#x27;s idle now--he snaps his right forearm. Of course the</p>
<p>squarehead comes back at &#x27;m on the jump, an&#x27; it&#x27;s good night for</p>
<p>Bill. Gee! Us Mohegans are gettin&#x27; our bad luck handed to us in</p>
<p>chunks these days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot; Saxon cried, shuddering involuntarily.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Billy asked with open mouth of surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t say that word again. Bert was always saying it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Mohegans. All right, I won&#x27;t. You ain&#x27;t superstitions, are</p>
<p>you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; but just the same there&#x27;s too much truth in the word for me</p>
<p>to like it. Sometimes it seems as though he was right. Times have</p>
<p>changed. They&#x27;ve changed even since I was a little girl. We</p>
<p>crossed the plains and opened up this country, and now we&#x27;re</p>
<p>losing even the chance to work for a living in it. And it&#x27;s not</p>
<p>my fault, it&#x27;s not your fault. We&#x27;ve got to live well or bad just</p>
<p>hy luck, it seems. There&#x27;s no other way to explain it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It beats me,&quot; Billy concurred. &quot;Look at the way I worked last</p>
<p>year. Never missed a day. I&#x27;d want to never miss a day this year,</p>
<p>an&#x27; here I haven&#x27;t done a tap for weeks an&#x27; weeks an&#x27; weeks. Say!</p>
<p>Who runs this country anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon had stopped the morning paper, but frequently Maggie</p>
<p>Donahue&#x27;s boy, who served a Tribune route, tossed an &quot;extra&quot; on</p>
<p>her steps. From its editorials Saxon gleaned that organized labor</p>
<p>was trying to run the country and that it was making a mess of</p>
<p>it. It was all the fault of domineering labor--so ran the</p>
<p>editorials, column by column, day by day; and Saxon was</p>
<p>convinced, yet remained unconvinced. The social puzzle of living</p>
<p>was too intricate.</p>
<p>The teamsters&#x27; strike, backed financially by the teamsters of San</p>
<p>Francisco and by the allied unions of the San Francisco Water</p>
<p>Front Confederation, promised to be long-drawn, whether or not it</p>
<p>was successful. The Oakland harness-washers and stablemen, with</p>
<p>few exceptions, had gone out with the teamsters. The teaming</p>
<p>firm&#x27;s were not half-filling their contracts, but the employers&#x27;</p>
<p>association was helping them. In fact, half the employers&#x27;</p>
<p>associations of the Pacific Coast were helping the Oakland</p>
<p>Employers&#x27; Association.</p>
<p>Saxon was behind a month&#x27;s rent, which, when it is considered</p>
<p>that rent was paid in advance, was equivalent to two months.</p>
<p>Likewise, she was two months behind in the installments on the</p>
<p>furniture. Yet she was not pressed very hard by Salinger&#x27;s, the</p>
<p>furniture dealers.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re givin&#x27; you all the rope we can,&quot; said their collector. &quot;My</p>
<p>orders is to make yon dig up every cent I can and at the same</p>
<p>time not to be too hard. Salinger&#x27;s are trying to do the right</p>
<p>thing, but they&#x27;re up against it, too. You&#x27;ve no idea how many</p>
<p>accounts like yours they&#x27;re carrying along. Sooner or later</p>
<p>they&#x27;ll have to call a halt or get it in the neck themselves. And</p>
<p>in the meantime just see if you can&#x27;t scrape up five dollars by</p>
<p>next week--just to cheer them along, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the stablemen who had not gone out, Henderson by name,</p>
<p>worked at Billy&#x27;s stables. Despite the urging of the bosses to</p>
<p>eat and sleep in the stable like the other men, Henderson had</p>
<p>persisted in coming home each morning to his little house around</p>
<p>the corner from Saxon&#x27;s on Fifth street. Several times she had</p>
<p>seen him swinging along defiantly, his dinner pail in his hand,</p>
<p>while the neighborhood boys dogged his heels at a safe distance</p>
<p>and informed him in yapping chorus that he was a scab and no</p>
<p>good. But one evening, on his way to work, in a spirit of bravado</p>
<p>he went into the Pile-Drivers&#x27; Home, the saloon at Seventh and</p>
<p>Pine. There it was his mortal mischance to encounter Otto Frank,</p>
<p>a striker who drove from the same stable. Not many minutes later</p>
<p>an ambulance was hurrylug Henderson to the receiving hospital</p>
<p>with a fractured skull, while a patrol wagon was no less swiftly</p>
<p>carrying Otto Frank to the city prison.</p>
<p>Maggie Donahue it was, eyes shining with gladness, who told Saxon</p>
<p>of the happening.</p>
<p>&quot;Served him right, too, the dirty scab,&quot; Maggie concluded.</p>
<p>&quot;But his poor wife!&quot; was Saxon&#x27;s cry. &quot;She&#x27;s not strong. And then</p>
<p>the children. She&#x27;ll never be able to take care of them if her</p>
<p>husband dies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; serve her right, the damned slut!&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was both shocked and hurt by the Irishwoman&#x27;s brutality.</p>
<p>But Maggie was implacable.</p>
<p>&quot; &#x27;Tis all she or any woman deserves that&#x27;ll put up an&#x27; live with</p>
<p>a scab. What about her children? Let&#x27;m starve, an&#x27; her man</p>
<p>a-takin&#x27; the food out of other children&#x27;s mouths.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Olsen&#x27;s attitude was different. Beyond passive sentimental</p>
<p>pity for Henderson&#x27;s wife and children, she gave them no thought,</p>
<p>her chief concern being for Otto Frank and Otto Frank&#x27;s wife and</p>
<p>children--herself and Mrs. Frank being full sisters.</p>
<p>&quot;If he dies, they will hang Otto,&quot; she asid. &quot;And then what will</p>
<p>poor Hilda do? She has varicose veins in both legs, and she never</p>
<p>can stand on her feet all day an&#x27; work for wages. And me, I</p>
<p>cannot help. Ain&#x27;t Carl out of work, too?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy had still another point of view.</p>
<p>&quot;It will give the strike a black eye, especially if Henderson</p>
<p>croaks,&quot; he worried, when he came home. &quot;They&#x27;ll hang Frank on</p>
<p>record time. Besides, we&#x27;ll have to put up a defense, an&#x27; lawyers</p>
<p>charge like Sam Hill. They&#x27;ll eat a hole in our treasury you</p>
<p>could drive every team in Oakland through. An&#x27; if Frank hadn&#x27;t</p>
<p>ben screwed up with whisky he&#x27;d never a-done it. He&#x27;s the</p>
<p>mildest, good-naturedest man sober you ever seen.&quot;</p>
<p>Twice that evening Billy left the house to find out if Henderson</p>
<p>was dead yet. In the morning the papers gave little hope, and the</p>
<p>evening papers published his death. Otto Frank lay in jail</p>
<p>without bail. The Tribune demanded a quick trial and summary</p>
<p>execution, calling on the prospective jury manfully to do its</p>
<p>duty and dwelling at length on the moral effect that would be so</p>
<p>produced upon the lawless working class. It went further,</p>
<p>emphasising the salutary effect machine guns would have on the</p>
<p>mob that had taken the fair city of Oakland by the throat.</p>
<p>And all such occurrences struck at Saxon personally. Practically</p>
<p>alone in the world, save for Billy, it was her life, and his, and</p>
<p>their mutual love-life, that was menaced. From the moment he left</p>
<p>the house to the moment of his return she knew no peace of mind.</p>
<p>Rough work was afoot, of which he told her nothing, and she knew</p>
<p>he was playing his part in it. On more than one occasion she</p>
<p>noticed fresh-broken skin on his knuckles. At such times he was</p>
<p>remarkably taciturn, and would sit in brooding silence or go</p>
<p>almost immediately to bed. She was afraid to have this habit of</p>
<p>reticence grow on him, and bravely she bid for his confidence.</p>
<p>She climbed into his lap and inside his arms, one of her arms</p>
<p>around his neck, and with the free hand she caressed his hair</p>
<p>back from the forehead and smoothed out tbe moody brows.</p>
<p>&quot;Now listen to me, Billy Boy,&quot; she began lightly. &quot;You haven&#x27;t</p>
<p>been playing fair, and I won&#x27;t have it. No!&quot; She pressed his lips</p>
<p>shut with her fingers. &quot;I&#x27;m doing the talking now, and because</p>
<p>you haven&#x27;t been doing your share of the talking for some time.</p>
<p>You remember we agreed at the start to always talk things over. I</p>
<p>was the first to break this, when I sold my fancy work to Mrs.</p>
<p>Higgins without speaking to you about it. And I was very sorry. I</p>
<p>am still sorry. And I&#x27;ve never done it since. Now it&#x27;s your turn.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re not talking things over with me. You are doing things you</p>
<p>don&#x27;t tell me about.</p>
<p>&quot;Billy, you&#x27;re dearer to me than anything else in the world. You</p>
<p>know that. We&#x27;re sharing each other&#x27;s lives, only, just now,</p>
<p>there&#x27;s something you&#x27;re not sharing. Every time your knuckles</p>
<p>are sore, there&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t share. If you can&#x27;t trust</p>
<p>me, you can&#x27;t trust anybody. And, besides, I love you so that no</p>
<p>matter what you do I&#x27;ll go on loving you just the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy gazed at her with fond incredulity.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t be a pincher,&quot; she teased. &quot;Remember, I stand for whatever</p>
<p>you do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you won&#x27;t buck against me?&quot; he queried.</p>
<p>&quot;How can I? I&#x27;m not your boss, Billy. I wouldn&#x27;t boss you for</p>
<p>anything in the world. And if you&#x27;d let me boss you, I wouldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>love you half as much.&quot;</p>
<p>He digested this slowly, and finally nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; you won&#x27;t be mad?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With you? You&#x27;ve never seen me mad yet. Now come on and be</p>
<p>generous and tell me how you hurt your knuckles. It&#x27;s fresh</p>
<p>to-day. Anybody can see that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right. I&#x27;ll tell you how it happened.&quot; He stopped and</p>
<p>giggled with genuine boyish glee at some recollection. &quot;It&#x27;s like</p>
<p>this. You won&#x27;t be mad, now? We gotta do these sort of things to</p>
<p>hold our own. Well, here&#x27;s the show, a regular movin&#x27; picture</p>
<p>except for file talkin&#x27;. Here&#x27;s a big rube comin&#x27; along, hayseed</p>
<p>stickin&#x27; out all over, hands like hams an&#x27; feet like Mississippi</p>
<p>gunboats. He&#x27;d make half as much again as me in size an&#x27; he&#x27;s</p>
<p>young, too. Only he ain&#x27;t lookin&#x27; for trouble, an&#x27; he&#x27;s as</p>
<p>innocent as ... well, he&#x27;s the innocentest scab that ever come</p>
<p>down the pike an&#x27; bumped into a couple of pickets. Not a regular</p>
<p>strike-breaker, you see, just a big rube that&#x27;s read the bosses&#x27;</p>
<p>ads an&#x27; come a-humpin&#x27; to town for the big wages.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; here&#x27;s Bud Strothers an&#x27; me comin&#x27; along. We always go in</p>
<p>pairs that way, an&#x27; sometimes bigger bunches. I flag the rube.</p>
<p>&#x27;Hello,&#x27; says I, &#x27;lookin&#x27; for a job?&#x27; &#x27;You bet,&#x27; says he. &#x27;Can</p>
<p>you drive?&#x27; &#x27;Yep.&#x27; &#x27;Four horses!&#x27; &#x27;Show me to &#x27;em,&#x27; says he. &#x27;No</p>
<p>josh, now,&#x27; says I; &#x27;you&#x27;re sure wantin&#x27; to drive?&#x27; &#x27;That&#x27;s what</p>
<p>I come to town for,&#x27; he says. &#x27;You&#x27;re the man we&#x27;re lookin&#x27; for,&#x27;</p>
<p>says I. &#x27;Come along, an&#x27; we&#x27;ll have you busy in no time.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;You see, Saxon, we can&#x27;t pull it off there, because there&#x27;s Tom</p>
<p>Scanlon--you know, the red-headed cop only a couple of blocks</p>
<p>away an&#x27; pipin&#x27; us off though not recognizin&#x27; us. So away we go,</p>
<p>the three of us, Bud an&#x27; me leadin&#x27; that boob to take our jobs</p>
<p>away from us I guess nit. We turn into the alley back of</p>
<p>Campwell&#x27;s grocery. Nobody in sight. Bud stops short, and the</p>
<p>rube an&#x27; me stop.</p>
<p>&quot; &#x27;I don&#x27;t think he wants to drive,&#x27; Bud says, considerin&#x27;. An&#x27;</p>
<p>the rube says quick, &#x27;You betcher life I do.&#x27; &#x27;You&#x27;re dead sure</p>
<p>you want that job?&#x27; I says. Yes, he&#x27;s dead sure. Nothin&#x27;s goin&#x27;</p>
<p>to keep him away from that job. Why, that job&#x27;s what he come to</p>
<p>town for, an&#x27; we can&#x27;t lead him to it too quick.</p>
<p>&quot; &#x27;Well, my friend,&#x27; says I, &#x27;it&#x27;s my sad duty to inform you that</p>
<p>you&#x27;ve made a mistake.&#x27; &#x27;How&#x27;s that?&#x27; he says. &#x27;Go on,&#x27; I says;</p>
<p>&#x27;you&#x27;re standin&#x27; on your foot.&#x27; And, honest to God, Saxon, that</p>
<p>gink looks down at his feet to see. &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand,&#x27; says</p>
<p>he. &#x27;We&#x27;re goin&#x27; to show you,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; then--Biff! Bang! Bingo! Swat! Zooie! Ker-slambango-blam!</p>
<p>Fireworks, Fourth of July, Kingdom Come, blue lights,</p>
<p>sky-rockets, an&#x27; hell fire--just like that. It don&#x27;t take long</p>
<p>when you&#x27;re scientific an&#x27; trained to tandem work. Of course it&#x27;s</p>
<p>hard on the knuckles. But say, Saxon, if you&#x27;d seen that rube</p>
<p>before an&#x27; after you&#x27;d thought he was a lightnin&#x27; change artist.</p>
<p>Laugh? You&#x27;d a-busted.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy halted to give vent to his own mirth. Saxon forced herself</p>
<p>to join with him, but down in her heart was horror. Mercedes was</p>
<p>right. The stupid workers wrangled and snarled over jobs. The</p>
<p>clever masters rode in automobiles and did not wrangle and snarl.</p>
<p>They hired other stupid ones to do the wrangling and snarling for</p>
<p>them. It was men like Bert and Frank Davis, like Chester Johnson</p>
<p>and Otto Frank, like Jelly Belly and the Pinkertons, like</p>
<p>Henderson and all the rest of the scabs, who were beaten up,</p>
<p>shot, clubbed, or hanged. Ah, the clever ones were very clever.</p>
<p>Nothing happened to them. They only rode in their automobiles.</p>
<p>&quot; &#x27;You big stiffs,&#x27; the rube snivels as he crawls to his feet at</p>
<p>the end,&quot; Billy was continuing. &quot; &#x27;You think you still want that</p>
<p>job?&#x27; I ask. He shakes his head. Then I read&#x27;m the riot act</p>
<p>&#x27;They&#x27;s only one thing for you to do, old hoss, an&#x27; that&#x27;s beat</p>
<p>it. D&#x27;ye get me? Beat it. Back to the farm for YOU. An&#x27; if you</p>
<p>come monkeyin&#x27; around town again, we&#x27;ll be real mad at you. We</p>
<p>was only foolin&#x27; this time. But next time we catch you your own</p>
<p>mother won&#x27;t know you when we get done with you.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27;--say!--you oughta seen&#x27;m beat it. I bet he&#x27;s goin&#x27; yet. Ah&#x27;</p>
<p>when he gets back to Milpitas, or Sleepy Hollow, or wherever he</p>
<p>hangs out, an&#x27; tells how the boys does things in Oakland, it&#x27;s</p>
<p>dollars to doughnuts they won&#x27;t be a rube in his district that&#x27;d</p>
<p>come to town to drive if they offered ten dollars an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was awful,&quot; Saxon said, then laughed well-simulated</p>
<p>appreciation.</p>
<p>&quot;But that was nothin&#x27;,&quot; Billy went on. &quot;A bunch of the boys</p>
<p>caught another one this morning. They didn&#x27;t do a thing to him.</p>
<p>My goodness gracious, no. In less&#x27;n two minutes he was the worst</p>
<p>wreck they ever hauled to the receivin&#x27; hospital. The evenin&#x27;</p>
<p>papers gave the score: nose broken, three bad scalp wounds, front</p>
<p>teeth out, a broken collarbone, an&#x27; two broken ribs. Gee! He</p>
<p>certainly got all that was comin&#x27; to him. But that&#x27;s nothin&#x27;.</p>
<p>D&#x27;ye want to know what the Frisco teamsters did in the big strike</p>
<p>before the Earthquake? They took every scab they caught an&#x27; broke</p>
<p>both his arms with a crowbar. That was so he couldn&#x27;t drive, you</p>
<p>see. Say, the hospitals was filled with &#x27;em. An&#x27; the teamsters</p>
<p>won that strike, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But is it necessary, Billy, to be so terrible? I know they&#x27;re</p>
<p>scabs, and that they&#x27;re taking the bread out of the strikers&#x27;</p>
<p>children&#x27;s mouths to put in their own children&#x27;s mouths, and that</p>
<p>it isn&#x27;t fair and all that; but just the same is it necessary to</p>
<p>be so ... terrible?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Billy answered confidently. &quot;We just gotta throw</p>
<p>the fear of God into them--when we can do it without bein&#x27;</p>
<p>caught.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if you&#x27;re caught?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then the union hires the lawyers to defend us, though that ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>much good now, for the judges are pretty hostyle, an&#x27; the papers</p>
<p>keep hammerin&#x27; away at them to give stiffer an&#x27; stiffer</p>
<p>sentences. Just the same, before this strike&#x27;s over there&#x27;ll be a</p>
<p>whole lot of guys a-wishin&#x27; they&#x27;d never gone scabbin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>Very cautiously, in the next half hour, Saxon tried to feel out</p>
<p>her husband&#x27;s attitude, to find if he doubted the rightness of</p>
<p>the violence he and his brother teamsters committed. But Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>ethical sanction was rock-bedded and profound. It never entered</p>
<p>his head that he was not absolutely right. It was the game.</p>
<p>Caught in its tangled meshes, he could see no other way to play</p>
<p>it than the way all men played it. He did not stand for dynamite</p>
<p>and murder, however. But then the unions did not stand for such.</p>
<p>Quite naive was his explanation that dynamite and murder did not</p>
<p>pay; that such actions always brought down the condemnation of</p>
<p>the public and broke the strikes. But the healthy beating up of a</p>
<p>scab, he contended--the &quot;throwing of the fear of God into a</p>
<p>scab,&quot; as he expressed it--was the only right and proper thing to</p>
<p>do.</p>
<p>&quot;Our folks never had to do such things,&quot; Saxon said finally.</p>
<p>&quot;They never had strikes nor scabs in those times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bet they didn&#x27;t,&quot; Billy agreed &quot;Them was the good old days.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d liked to a-lived then.&quot; He drew a long breath and sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;But them times will never come again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you have liked living in the country?&quot; Saxon asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s lots of men living in the country now,&quot; she suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same I notice them a-hikin&#x27; to town to get our jobs,&quot;</p>
<p>was his reply.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>A gleam of light came, when Billy got a job driving a grading</p>
<p>team for the contractors of the big bridge then building at</p>
<p>Niles. Before he went he made certain that it was a union job.</p>
<p>And a union job it was for two days, when the concrete workers</p>
<p>threw down their tools. The contractors, evidently prepared for</p>
<p>such happening, immediately filled the places of the concrete men</p>
<p>with nonunion Italians. Whereupon the carpenters, structural</p>
<p>ironworkers and teamsters walked out; and Billy, lacking train</p>
<p>fare, spent the rest of the day in walking home.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn&#x27;t work as a scab,&quot; he concluded his tale.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Saxon said; &quot;you couldn&#x27;t work as a scab.&quot;</p>
<p>But she wondered why it was that when men wanted to work, and</p>
<p>there was work to do, yet they were unable to work because their</p>
<p>unions said no. Why were there unions? And, if unions had to be,</p>
<p>why were not all workingmen in them? Then there would be no</p>
<p>scabs, and Billy could work every day. Also, she wondered where</p>
<p>she was to get a sack of flour, for she had long since ceased the</p>
<p>extravagance of baker&#x27;s bread. And so many other of the</p>
<p>neighborhood women had done this, that the little Welsh baker had</p>
<p>closed up shop and gone away, taking his wife and two little</p>
<p>daughters with him. Look where she would, everybody was being</p>
<p>hurt by the industrial strife.</p>
<p>One afternoon came a caller at her door, and that evening came</p>
<p>Billy with dubious news. He had been approached that day. All he</p>
<p>had to do, he told Saxon, was to say the word, and he could go</p>
<p>into the stable as foreman at one hundred dollars a month.</p>
<p>The nearness of such a sum, the possibility of it, was almost</p>
<p>stunning to Saxon, sitting at a supper which consisted of boiled</p>
<p>potatoes, warmed-over beans, and a small dry onion which they</p>
<p>were eating raw. There was neither bread, coffee, nor butter. The</p>
<p>onion Billy had pulled from his pocket, having picked it up in</p>
<p>the street. One hundred dollars a month! She moistened her lips</p>
<p>and fought for control.</p>
<p>&quot;What made them offer it to you?&quot; she questioned.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s easy,&quot; was his answer. &quot;They got a dozen reasons. The guy</p>
<p>the boss has had exercisin&#x27; Prince and King is a dub. King has</p>
<p>gone lame in the shoulders. Then they&#x27;re guessin&#x27; pretty strong</p>
<p>that I&#x27;m the party that&#x27;s put a lot of their scabs outa</p>
<p>commission. Macklin&#x27;s ben their foreman for years an&#x27; years--why</p>
<p>I was in knee pants when he was foreman. Well, he&#x27;s sick an&#x27; all</p>
<p>in. They gotta have somebody to take his place. Then, too, I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>been with &#x27;em a long time. An&#x27; on top of that, I&#x27;m the man for</p>
<p>the job. They know I know horses from the ground up. Hell, it&#x27;s</p>
<p>all I&#x27;m good for, except sluggin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Think of it, Billy!&quot; she broathed. &quot;A hundred dollars a month! A</p>
<p>hundred dollars a month!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; throw the fellows down,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was not a question. Nor was it a statement. It was anything</p>
<p>Saxon chose to make of it. They looked at each other. She waited</p>
<p>for him to speak; but he continued merely to look. It came to her</p>
<p>that she was facing one of the decisive moments of her life, and</p>
<p>she gripped herself to face it in all coolness. Nor would Billy</p>
<p>proffer her the slightest help. Whatever his own judgment might</p>
<p>be, he masked it with an expressionless face. His eyes betrayed</p>
<p>nothing. He looked and waited.</p>
<p>&quot;You ... you can&#x27;t do that, Billy,&quot; she said finally. &quot;You can&#x27;t</p>
<p>throw the fellows down.&quot;</p>
<p>His hand shot out to hers, and his face was a sudden, radiant</p>
<p>dawn.</p>
<p>&quot;Put her there!&quot; he cried, their hands meeting and clasping.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re the truest true blue wife a man ever had. If all the</p>
<p>other fellows&#x27; wives was like you, we could win any strike we</p>
<p>tackled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What would you have done if you weren&#x27;t married, Billy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seen &#x27;em in hell first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Than it doesn&#x27;t make any difference being married. I&#x27;ve got to</p>
<p>stand by you in everything you stand for. I&#x27;d be a nice wife if I</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>She remembered her caller of the afternoon, and knew the moment</p>
<p>was too propitious to let pass.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a man here this afternoon, Billy. He wanted a room. I</p>
<p>told him I&#x27;d speak to you. He said he would pay six dollars a</p>
<p>month for the back bedroom. That would pay half a month&#x27;s</p>
<p>installment on the furniture and buy a sack of flour, and we&#x27;re</p>
<p>all out of flour.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s old hostility to the idea was instantly uppermost, and</p>
<p>Saxon watched him anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Some scab in the shops, I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; he&#x27;s firing on the freight run to San Jose. Harmon, he said</p>
<p>his name was, James Harmon. They&#x27;ve just transferred him from the</p>
<p>Truckee division. He&#x27;ll sleep days mostly, he said; and that&#x27;s</p>
<p>why he wanted a quiet house without children in it.&quot;</p>
<p>In the end, with much misgiving, and only after Saxon had</p>
<p>insistently pointed out how little work it entailed on her, Billy</p>
<p>consented, though he continued to protest, as an afterthought</p>
<p>&quot;But I don&#x27;t want you makin&#x27; beds for any man. It ain&#x27;t right,</p>
<p>Saxon. I oughta take care of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you would,&quot; she flashed back at him, &quot;if you&#x27;d take the</p>
<p>foremanship. Only you can&#x27;t. It wouldn&#x27;t be right. And if I&#x27;m to</p>
<p>stand by you it&#x27;s only fair to let me do what I can.&quot;</p>
<p>James Harmon proved even less a bother than Saxon had</p>
<p>anticipated. For a fireman he was scrupulously clean, always</p>
<p>washing up in the roundhouse before he came home. He used the key</p>
<p>to the kitchen door, coming and going by the back steps. To Saxon</p>
<p>he barely said how-do-you-do or good day; and, sleeping in the</p>
<p>day time and working at night, he was in the house a week before</p>
<p>Billy laid eyes on him.</p>
<p>Billy had taken to coming home later and later, and to going out</p>
<p>after supper by himself. He did not offer to tell Saxon where he</p>
<p>went. Nor did she ask. For that matter it required little</p>
<p>shrewdness on her part to guess. The fumes of whisky were on his</p>
<p>lips at such times. His slow, deliberate ways were even slower,</p>
<p>even more deliberate. Liquor did not affect his legs. He walked</p>
<p>as soberly as any man. There was no hesitancy, no faltering, in</p>
<p>his muscular movements. The whisky went to his brain, making his</p>
<p>eyes heavy-lidded and the cloudiness of them more cloudy. Not</p>
<p>that he was flighty, nor quick, nor irritable. On the contrary,</p>
<p>the liquor imparted to his mental processes a deep gravity and</p>
<p>brooding solemnity. He talked little, but that little was ominous</p>
<p>and oracular. At such times there was no appeal from his</p>
<p>judgment, no discussion. He knew, as God knew. And when he chose</p>
<p>to speak a harsh thought, it was ten-fold harsher than</p>
<p>ordinarily, because it seemed to proceed out of such profundity</p>
<p>of cogitation, because it was as prodigiously deliberate in its</p>
<p>incubation as it was in its enunciation.</p>
<p>It was not a nice side he was showing to Saxon. It was, almost,</p>
<p>as if a stranger had come to live with her. Despite herself, she</p>
<p>found herself beginning to shrink from him. And little could she</p>
<p>comfort herself with the thought that it was not his real self,</p>
<p>for she remembered his gentleness and considerateness, all his</p>
<p>finenesses of the past. Then he had made a continual effort to</p>
<p>avoid trouble and fighting. Now he enjoyed it, exulted in it,</p>
<p>went looking for it. All this showed in his face. No longer was</p>
<p>he the smiling, pleasant-faced boy. He smiled infrequently now.</p>
<p>His face was a man&#x27;s face. The lips, the eyes, the lines were</p>
<p>harsh as his thoughts were harsh.</p>
<p>He was rarely unkind to Saxon; but, on the other hand he was</p>
<p>rarely kind. His attitude toward her was growing negative. He was</p>
<p>disinterested. Despite the fight for the union she was enduring</p>
<p>with him, putting up with him shoulder to shoulder, she occupied</p>
<p>but little space in his mind. When he acted toward her gently,</p>
<p>she could see that it was merely mechanical, just as she was well</p>
<p>aware that the endearing terms he used, the endearing caresses he</p>
<p>gave, were only habitual. The spontaneity and warmth had gone</p>
<p>out. Often, when he was not in liquor, flashes of the old Billy</p>
<p>came back, but even such flashes dwindled in frequency. He was</p>
<p>growing preoccupied, moody. Hard times and the bitter stresses of</p>
<p>industrial conflict strained him. Especially was this apparent in</p>
<p>his sleep, when he suffered paroxysms of lawless dreams, groaning</p>
<p>and muttering, clenching his fists, grinding his teeth, twisting</p>
<p>with muscular tensions, his face writhing with passions and</p>
<p>violences, his throat guttering with terrible curses that rasped</p>
<p>and aborted on his lips. And Saxon, lying beside him, afraid of</p>
<p>this visitor to her bed whom she did not know, remembered what</p>
<p>Mary had told her of Bert. He, too, had cursed and clenched his</p>
<p>fists, in his nights fought out the battles of his days.</p>
<p>One thing, however, Saxon saw clearly. By no deliberate act of</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s was he becoming this other and unlovely Billy. Were there</p>
<p>no strike, no snarling and wrangling over jobs, there would be</p>
<p>only the old Billy she had loved in all absoluteness. This</p>
<p>sleeping terror in him would have lain asleep. It was something</p>
<p>that was being awakened in him, an image incarnate of outward</p>
<p>conditions, as cruel, as ugly, as maleficent as were those</p>
<p>outward conditions. But if the strike continued, then, she</p>
<p>feared, with reason, would this other and grisly self of Billy</p>
<p>strengthen to fuller and more forbidding stature. And this, she</p>
<p>knew, would mean the wreck of their love-life. Such a Billy she</p>
<p>could not love; in its nature such a Billy was not lovable nor</p>
<p>capable of love. And then, at the thought of offspring, she</p>
<p>shuddered. It was too terrible. And at such moments of</p>
<p>contemplation, from her soul the inevitable plaint of the human</p>
<p>went up: WHY? WHY? WHY?</p>
<p>Billy, too, had his unanswerable queries.</p>
<p>&quot;Why won&#x27;t the building trades come out?&quot; he demanded wrathfuly</p>
<p>of the obscurity that veiled the ways of living and the world.</p>
<p>&quot;But no; O&#x27;Brien won&#x27;t stand for a strike, and he has the</p>
<p>Building Trades Council under his thumb. But why don&#x27;t they chuck</p>
<p>him and come out anyway? We&#x27;d win hands down all along the line.</p>
<p>But no, O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s got their goat, an&#x27; him up to his dirty neck in</p>
<p>politics an&#x27; graft! An&#x27; damn the Federation of Labor! If all the</p>
<p>railroad boys had come out, wouldn&#x27;t the shop men have won</p>
<p>instead of bein&#x27; licked to a frazzle? Lord, I ain&#x27;t had a smoke</p>
<p>of decent tobacco or a cup of decent coffee in a coon&#x27;s age. I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>forgotten what a square meal tastes like. I weighed myself</p>
<p>yesterday. Fifteen pounds lighter than when the strike begun. If</p>
<p>it keeps on much more I can fight middleweight. An&#x27; this is what</p>
<p>I get after payin&#x27; dues into the union for years and years. I</p>
<p>can&#x27;t get a square meal, an&#x27; my wife has to make other men&#x27;s</p>
<p>beds. It makes my tired ache. Some day I&#x27;ll get real huffy an&#x27;</p>
<p>chuck that lodger out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s not his fault, Billy,&quot; Saxon protested.</p>
<p>&quot;Who said it was?&quot; Billy snapped roughly. &quot;Can&#x27;t I kick in</p>
<p>general if I want to? Just the same it makes me sick. What&#x27;s the</p>
<p>good of organized labor if it don&#x27;t stand together? For two cents</p>
<p>I&#x27;d chuck the whole thing up an&#x27; go over to the employers. Only I</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t, God damn them! If they think they can beat us down to</p>
<p>our knees, let&#x27;em go ahead an&#x27; try it, that&#x27;s all. But it gets me</p>
<p>just the same. The whole world&#x27;s clean dippy. They ain&#x27;t no sense</p>
<p>in anything. What&#x27;s the good of supportin&#x27; a union that can&#x27;t win</p>
<p>a strike? What&#x27;s the good of knockin&#x27; the blocks off of scabs</p>
<p>when they keep a-comin&#x27; thick as ever? The whole thing&#x27;s</p>
<p>bughouse, an&#x27; I guess I am, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Such an outburst on Billy&#x27;s part was so unusual that it was the</p>
<p>only time Saxon knew it to occur. Always he was sullen, and</p>
<p>dogged, and unwhipped; while whisky only served to set the</p>
<p>maggots of certitude crawling in his brain.</p>
<p>One night Billy did not get home till after twelve. Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>anxiety was increased by the fact that police fighting and head</p>
<p>breaking had been reported to have occurred. When Billy came, his</p>
<p>appearance verified the report. His coatsleeves were half torn</p>
<p>off. The Windsor tie had disappeared from under his soft</p>
<p>turned-down collar, and every button had been ripped off the</p>
<p>front of the shirt. When he took his hat off, Saxon was</p>
<p>frightened by a lump on his head the size of an apple.</p>
<p>&quot;D&#x27;ye know who did that? That Dutch slob Hermanmann, with a riot</p>
<p>club. An&#x27; I&#x27;ll get&#x27;m for it some day, good an&#x27; plenty. An&#x27;</p>
<p>there&#x27;s another fellow I got staked out that&#x27;ll be my meat when</p>
<p>this strike&#x27;s over an&#x27; things is settled down. Blanchard&#x27;s his</p>
<p>name, Roy Blanchard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not of Blanchard, Perkins and Company?&quot; Saxon asked, busy</p>
<p>washing Billy&#x27;s hurt and making her usual fight to keep him calm.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep; except he&#x27;s the son of the old man. What&#x27;s he do, that</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t done a tap of work in all his life except to blow the old</p>
<p>man&#x27;s money? He goes strike-breakin&#x27;. Grandstand play, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>what I call it. Gets his name in the papers an makes all the</p>
<p>skirts he runs with fluster up an&#x27; say: &#x27;My! Some bear, that Roy</p>
<p>Blanchard, some bear.&#x27; Some bear--the gazabo! He&#x27;ll be bear-meat</p>
<p>for me some day. I never itched so hard to lick a man in my life.</p>
<p>&quot;And--oh, I guess I&#x27;ll pass that Dutch cop up. He got his</p>
<p>already. Somebody broke his head with a lump of coal the size of</p>
<p>a water bucket. That was when the wagons was turnin&#x27; into</p>
<p>Franklin, just off Eighth, by the old Galindo Hotel. They was</p>
<p>hard fightin&#x27; there, an&#x27; some guy in the hotel lams that coal</p>
<p>down from the second story window.</p>
<p>&quot;They was fightin&#x27; every block of the way--bricks, cobblestones,</p>
<p>an&#x27; police-clubs to beat the band. They don&#x27;t dast call out the</p>
<p>troops. An&#x27; they was afraid to shoot. Why, we tore holes through</p>
<p>the police force, an&#x27; the ambulanees and patrol wagons worked</p>
<p>over-time. But say, we got the procession blocked at Fourteenth</p>
<p>and Broadway, right under the nose of the City Hall, rushed the</p>
<p>rear end, cut out the horses of five wagons, an&#x27; handed them</p>
<p>college guys a few love-pats in passin&#x27;. All that saved &#x27;em from</p>
<p>hospital was the police reserves. Just the same we had &#x27;em jammed</p>
<p>an hour there. You oughta seen the street cars blocked,</p>
<p>too--Broadway, Fourteenth, San Pablo, as far as you could see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what did Blanchard do?&quot; Saxon called him back.</p>
<p>&quot;He led the procession, an&#x27; he drove my team. All the teams was</p>
<p>from my stable. He rounded up a lot of them college</p>
<p>fellows--fraternity guys, they&#x27;re called--yaps that live off</p>
<p>their fathers&#x27; money. They come to the stable in big tourin&#x27; cars</p>
<p>an&#x27; drove out the wagons with half the police of Oakland to help</p>
<p>them. Say, it was sure some day. The sky rained cobblestones. An&#x27;</p>
<p>you oughta heard the clubs on our heads--rat-tat-tat-tat,</p>
<p>rat-tat-tat-tat! An&#x27; say, the chief of police, in a police auto,</p>
<p>sittin&#x27; up like God Almighty--just before we got to Peralta</p>
<p>street they was a block an&#x27; the police chargin&#x27;, an&#x27; an old</p>
<p>woman, right from her front gate, lammed the chief of police full</p>
<p>in the face with a dead cat. Phew! You could hear it. &#x27;Arrest</p>
<p>that woman!&#x27; he yells, with his handkerchief out. But the boys</p>
<p>beat the cops to her an&#x27; got her away. Some day? I guess yes. The</p>
<p>receivin&#x27; hospital went outa commission on the jump, an&#x27; the</p>
<p>overflow was spilled into St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, an&#x27; Fabiola, an&#x27; I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know where else. Eight of our men was pulled, an&#x27; a dozen</p>
<p>of the Frisco teamsters that&#x27;s come over to help. They&#x27;re holy</p>
<p>terrors, them Frisco teamsters. It seemed half the workingmen of</p>
<p>Oakland was helpin&#x27; us, an&#x27; they must be an army of them in jail.</p>
<p>Our lawyers&#x27;ll have to take their cases, too.</p>
<p>&quot;But take it from me, it&#x27;s the last we&#x27;ll see of Roy Blanchard</p>
<p>an&#x27; yaps of his kidney buttin&#x27; into our affairs. I guess we</p>
<p>showed &#x27;em some football. You know that brick buildin&#x27; they&#x27;re</p>
<p>puttin&#x27; up on Bay street? That&#x27;s where we loaded up first, an&#x27;,</p>
<p>say, you couldn&#x27;t see the wagon-seats for bricks when they</p>
<p>started from the stables. Blanchard drove the first wagon, an&#x27; he</p>
<p>was knocked clean off the seat once, but he stayed with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He must have been brave,&quot; Saxon commented.</p>
<p>&quot;Brave?&quot; Billy flared. &quot;With the police, an&#x27; the army an&#x27; navy</p>
<p>behind him? I suppose you&#x27;ll be takin&#x27; their part next. Brave?</p>
<p>A-takin&#x27; the food outa the mouths of our women an children.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t Curley Jones&#x27;s little kid die last night? Mother&#x27;s milk</p>
<p>not nourishin&#x27;, that&#x27;s what it was, because she didn&#x27;t have the</p>
<p>right stuff to eat. An&#x27; I know, an&#x27; you know, a dozen old aunts,</p>
<p>an&#x27; sister-in-laws, an&#x27; such, that&#x27;s had to hike to the poorhouse</p>
<p>because their folks couldn&#x27;t take care of &#x27;em in these times.&quot;</p>
<p>In the morning paper Saxon read the exciting account of the</p>
<p>futile attempt to break the teamsters&#x27; strike. Roy Blanchard was</p>
<p>hailed a hero and held up as a model of wealthy citizenship. And</p>
<p>to save herself she could not help glowing with appreciation of</p>
<p>his courage. There was something fine in his going out to face</p>
<p>the snarling pack. A brigadier general of the regular army was</p>
<p>quoted as lamenting the fact that the troops had not been called</p>
<p>out to take the mob by the throat and shake law and order into</p>
<p>it. &quot;This is the time for a little healthful bloodletting,&quot; was</p>
<p>the conclusion of his remarks, after deploring the pacific</p>
<p>methods of the police. &quot;For not until the mob has been thoroughly</p>
<p>beaten and cowed will tranquil industrial conditions obtain.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening Saxon and Billy went up town. Returning home and</p>
<p>finding nothing to eat, he had taken her on one arm, his overcoat</p>
<p>on the other. The overcoat he had pawned at Uncle Sam&#x27;s, and he</p>
<p>and Saxon had eaten drearily at a Japanese restaurant which in</p>
<p>some miraculous way managed to set a semi-satisfying meal for ten</p>
<p>cents. After eating, they started on their way to spend an</p>
<p>additional five cents each on a moving picture show.</p>
<p>At the Central Bank Building, two striking teamsters accosted</p>
<p>Billy and took him away with them. Saxon waited on the corner,</p>
<p>and when he returned, three quarters of an hour later, she knew</p>
<p>he had been drinking.</p>
<p>Half a block on, passing the Forum Cafe, he stopped suddenly. A</p>
<p>limousine stood at the curb, and into it a young man was helping</p>
<p>several wonderfully gowned women. A chauffeur sat in the driver&#x27;s</p>
<p>sent. Billy touched the young man on the arm. He was as</p>
<p>broad-shouldered as Billy and slightly taller. Blue-eyed,</p>
<p>strong-featured, in Saxon&#x27;s opinion he was undeniably handsome.</p>
<p>&quot;Just a word, sport,&quot; Billy said, in a low, slow voice.</p>
<p>The young man glanced quickly at Billy and Saxon, and asked</p>
<p>impatiently:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re Blanchard,&quot; Billy began. &quot;I seen you yesterday lead out</p>
<p>that bunch of teams.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn&#x27;t I do it all right?&quot; Blanchard asked gaily, with a flash</p>
<p>of glance to Saxon and back again.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. But that ain&#x27;t what I want to talk about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; the other demanded with sudden suspicion.</p>
<p>&quot;A striker. It just happens you drove my team, that&#x27;s all. No;</p>
<p>don&#x27;t move for a gun.&quot; (As Blanchard half reached toward his hip</p>
<p>pocket.) &quot;I ain&#x27;t startin&#x27; anythin&#x27; here. But I just want to tell</p>
<p>you something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be quick, then.&quot;</p>
<p>Blanchard lifted one foot to step into the machine.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; Billy went on without any diminution of his exasperating</p>
<p>slowness. &quot;What I want to tell you is that I&#x27;m after you. Not</p>
<p>now, when the strike&#x27;s on, but some time later I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to get</p>
<p>you an&#x27; give you the beatin&#x27; of your life.&quot;</p>
<p>Blanchard looked Billy over with new interest and measuring eyes</p>
<p>that sparkled with appreciation.</p>
<p>&quot;You are a husky yourself,&quot; he said. &quot;But do you think you can do</p>
<p>it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. You&#x27;re my meat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, then, my friend. Look me up after the strike is</p>
<p>settled, and I&#x27;ll give you a chance at me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remember,&quot; Billy added, &quot;I got you staked out.&quot;</p>
<p>Blanchard nodded, smiled genially to both of them, raised his hat</p>
<p>to Saxon, and stepped into the machine.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<p>From now on, to Saxon, life seemed bereft of its last reason and</p>
<p>rhyme. It had become senseless, nightmarish. Anything irrational</p>
<p>was possible. There was nothing stable in the anarchic flux of</p>
<p>affairs that swept her on she knew not to what catastrophic end.</p>
<p>Had Billy been dependable, all would still have been well. With</p>
<p>him to cling to she would have faced everything fearlessly. But</p>
<p>he had been whirled away from her in the prevailing madness. So</p>
<p>radical was the change in him that he seemed almost an intruder</p>
<p>in the house. Spiritually he was such an intruder. Another man</p>
<p>looked out of his eyes--a man whose thoughts were of violence and</p>
<p>hatred; a man to whom there was no good in anything, and who had</p>
<p>become an ardent protagonist of the evil that was rampant aud</p>
<p>universal. This man no longer condemned Bert, himself muttering</p>
<p>vaguely of dynamite, end sabotage, and revolution.</p>
<p>Saxon strove to maintain that sweetness and coolness of flesh and</p>
<p>spirit that Billy had praised in the old days. Once, only, she</p>
<p>lost control. He had been in a particularly ugly mood, and a</p>
<p>final harshness and unfairness cut her to the quick.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you speaking to?&quot; she flamed out at him.</p>
<p>He was speechless and abashed, and could only stare at her face,</p>
<p>which was white with anger.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you ever speak to me like that again, Billy,&quot; she</p>
<p>commanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, can&#x27;t you put up with a piece of bad temper?&quot; he muttered,</p>
<p>half apologetically, yet half defiantly. &quot;God knows I got enough</p>
<p>to make me cranky.&quot;</p>
<p>After he left the house she flung herself on the bed and cried</p>
<p>heart-brokenly. For she, who knew so thoroughly the humility of</p>
<p>love, was a proud woman. Only the proud can be truly humble, as</p>
<p>only the strong may know the fullness of gentleness. But what was</p>
<p>the use, she demanded, of being proud and game, when the only</p>
<p>person in the world who mattered to her lost his own pride and</p>
<p>gameness and fairness and gave her the worse share of their</p>
<p>mutual trouble?</p>
<p>And now, as she had faced alone the deeper, organic hurt of the</p>
<p>loss of her baby, she faced alone another, and, in a way, an even</p>
<p>greater personal trouble. Perhaps she loved Billy none the less,</p>
<p>but her love was changing into something less proud, less</p>
<p>confident, less trusting; it was becoming shot through with</p>
<p>pity--with the pity that is parent to contempt. Her own loyalty</p>
<p>was threatening to weaken, and she shuddered and shrank from the</p>
<p>contempt she could see creeping in.</p>
<p>She struggled to steel herself to face the situation. Forgiveness</p>
<p>stole into her heart, and she knew relief until the thought came</p>
<p>that in the truest, highest love forgiveness should have no</p>
<p>place. And again she cried, and continued her battle. After all,</p>
<p>one thing was incontestable: THIS BILLY WES NOT THE BILLY SHE HAD</p>
<p>LOVED. This Billy was another man, a sick man, and no more to be</p>
<p>held responsible than a fever-patient in the ravings of delirium.</p>
<p>She must be Billy&#x27;s nurse, without pride, without contempt, with</p>
<p>nothing to forgive. Besides, he was really bearing the brunt of</p>
<p>the fight, was in the thick of it, dizzy with the striking of</p>
<p>blows and the blows he received. If fault there was, it lay</p>
<p>elsewhere, somewhere in the tangled scheme of things that made</p>
<p>men snarl over jobs like dogs over bones.</p>
<p>So Saxon arose and buckled on her armor again for the hardest</p>
<p>fight of all in the world&#x27;s arena--the woman&#x27;s fight. She ejected</p>
<p>from her thought all doubting and distrust. She forgave nothing,</p>
<p>for there was nothing requiring forgiveness. She pledged herself</p>
<p>to an absoluteness of belief that her love and Billy&#x27;s was</p>
<p>unsullied, unperturbed--serere as it had always been, as it would</p>
<p>be when it came back again after the world settled down once more</p>
<p>to rational ways.</p>
<p>That night, when he came home, she proposed, as an emergency</p>
<p>measure, that she should resume her needlework and help keep the</p>
<p>pot boiling until the strike was over, But Billy would hear</p>
<p>nothing of it.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right,&quot; he assured her repeatedly. &quot;They ain&#x27;t no call</p>
<p>for you to work. I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to get some money before the week is</p>
<p>out. An&#x27; I&#x27;ll turn it over to you. An&#x27; Saturday night we&#x27;ll go to</p>
<p>the show--a real show, no movin&#x27; pictures. Harvey&#x27;s nigger</p>
<p>minstrels is comin&#x27; to town. We&#x27;ll go Saturday night. I&#x27;ll have</p>
<p>the money before that, as sure as beans is beans.&quot;</p>
<p>Friday evening he did not come home to supper, which Saxon</p>
<p>regretted, for Maggie Donahue had returned a pan of potatoes and</p>
<p>two quarts of flour (borrowed the week before), and it was a</p>
<p>hearty meal that awaited him. Saxon kept the stove going till</p>
<p>nine o&#x27;clock, when, despite her reluctance, she went to bed. Her</p>
<p>preference would have been to wait up, but she did not dare,</p>
<p>knowing full well what the effect would be on him did he come</p>
<p>home in liquor.</p>
<p>The clock had just struck one, when she heard the click of the</p>
<p>gate. Slowly, heavily, ominously, she heard him come up the steps</p>
<p>and fumble with his key at the door. He entered the bedroom, and</p>
<p>she heard him sigh as he sat down. She remained quiet, for she</p>
<p>had learned the hypersensitiveness induced by drink and was</p>
<p>fastidiously careful not to hurt him even with the knowledge that</p>
<p>she had lain awake for him. It was not easy. Her hands were</p>
<p>clenched till the nails dented the palms, and her body was rigid</p>
<p>in her passionate effort for control. Never had he come home as</p>
<p>bad as this.</p>
<p>&quot;Saxon,&quot; he called thickly. &quot;Saxon.&quot;</p>
<p>She stired and yawned.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Won&#x27;t you strike a light? My fingers is all thumbs.&quot;</p>
<p>Without looking at him, she complied; but so violent was the</p>
<p>nervous trembling of her hands that the glass chimney tinkled</p>
<p>against the globe and the match went out.</p>
<p>&quot;I ain&#x27;t drunk, Saxon,&quot; he said in the darkness, a hint of</p>
<p>amusement in his thick voice. &quot;I&#x27;ve only had two or three jolts</p>
<p>... of that sort.&quot;</p>
<p>On her second attempt with the lamp she succeeded. When she</p>
<p>turned to look at him she screamed with fright. Though she had</p>
<p>heard his voice and knew him to be Billy, for the instant she did</p>
<p>not recognize him. His face was a face she had never known.</p>
<p>Swollen, bruised, discolored, every feature had been beaten out</p>
<p>of all semblance of familiarity. One eye was entirely closed, the</p>
<p>other showed through a narrow slit of blood-congested flesh. One</p>
<p>ear seemed to have lost most of its skin. The whole face was a</p>
<p>swollen pulp. His right jaw, in particular, was twice the size of</p>
<p>the left. No wonder his speech had been thick, was her thought,</p>
<p>as she regarded the fearfully cut and swollen lips that still</p>
<p>bled. She was sickened by the sight, and her heart went out to</p>
<p>him in a great wave of tenderness. She wanted to put her arms</p>
<p>around him, and cuddle and soothe him; but her practical judgment</p>
<p>bade otherwise.</p>
<p>&quot;You poor, poor boy,&quot; she cried. &quot;Tell me what you want me to do</p>
<p>first. I don&#x27;t know about such things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you could help me get my clothes off,&quot; he suggested meekly</p>
<p>and thickly. &quot;I got &#x27;em on before I stiffened up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then hot water--that will be good,&quot; she said, as she began</p>
<p>gently drawing his coat sleeve over a puffed and helpless hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you they was all thumbs,&quot; he grimaced, holding up his</p>
<p>hand and squinting at it with the fraction of sight remaining to</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>&quot;You sit and wait,&quot; she said, &quot;till I start the fire and get the</p>
<p>hot water going. I won&#x27;t be a minute. Then I&#x27;ll finish getting</p>
<p>your clothes off.&quot;</p>
<p>From the kitchen she could hear him mumbling to himself, and when</p>
<p>she returned he was repeating over and over:</p>
<p>&quot;We needed the money, Saxon. We needed the money.&quot;</p>
<p>Drunken he was not, she could see that, and from his babbling she</p>
<p>knew he was partly delirious.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a surprise box,&quot; he wandered on, while she proceeded to</p>
<p>undress him; and bit by bit she was able to piece together what</p>
<p>had happened. &quot;He was an unknown from Chicago. They sprang him on</p>
<p>me. The secretary of the Acme Club warned me I&#x27;d have my hands</p>
<p>full. An&#x27; I&#x27;d a-won if I&#x27;d been in condition. But fifteen pounds</p>
<p>off without trainin&#x27; ain&#x27;t condition, Then I&#x27;d been drinkin&#x27;</p>
<p>pretty regular, an&#x27; I didn&#x27;t have my wind.&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon, stripping his undershirt, no longer heard him. As with</p>
<p>his face, she could not recognize his splendidly muscled back.</p>
<p>The white sheath of silken skin was torn and bloody. The</p>
<p>lacerations occurred oftenest in horizontal lines, though there</p>
<p>were perpendicular lines as well.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you get all that?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The ropes. I was up against &#x27;em more times than I like to</p>
<p>remember. Gee! He certainly gave me mine. But I fooled &#x27;m. He</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t put me out. I lasted the twenty rounds, an&#x27; I wanta tell</p>
<p>you he&#x27;s got some marks to remember me by. If he ain&#x27;t got a</p>
<p>couple of knuckles broke in the left hand I&#x27;m a geezer.--Here,</p>
<p>feel my head here. Swollen, eh? Sure thing. He hit that more</p>
<p>times than he&#x27;s wishin&#x27; he had right now. But, oh, what a lacin&#x27;!</p>
<p>What a lacin&#x27;! I never had anything like it before. The Chicago</p>
<p>Terror, they call &#x27;m. I take my hat off to &#x27;m. He&#x27;s some bear.</p>
<p>But I could a-made &#x27;m take the count if I&#x27;d ben in condition an&#x27;</p>
<p>had my wind.--Oh! Ouch! Watch out! It&#x27;s like a boil!&quot;</p>
<p>Fumbling at his waistband, Saxon&#x27;s hand had come in contact with</p>
<p>a brightly inflamed surface larger than a soup plate</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s from the kidney blows,&quot; Billy explained. &quot;He was a</p>
<p>regular devil at it. &#x27;Most every clench, like clock work, down</p>
<p>he&#x27;d chop one on me. It got so sore I was wincin&#x27; ... until I got</p>
<p>groggy an&#x27; didn&#x27;t know much of anything. It ain&#x27;t a knockout</p>
<p>blow, you know, but it&#x27;s awful wearin&#x27; in a long fight. It takes</p>
<p>the starch out of you.&quot;</p>
<p>When his knees were bared, Saxon could see the skin across the</p>
<p>knee-caps was broken and gone.</p>
<p>&quot;The skin ain&#x27;t made to stand a heavy fellow like me on the</p>
<p>knees,&quot; he volunteered. &quot;An&#x27; the rosin in the canvas cuts like</p>
<p>Sam Hill.&quot;</p>
<p>The tears were in Saxon&#x27;s eyes, and she could have cried over the</p>
<p>manhandled body of her beautiful sick boy.</p>
<p>As she carried his pants across the room to hang them up, a</p>
<p>jingle of money came from them. He called her back, and from the</p>
<p>pocket drew forth a handful of silver.</p>
<p>&quot;We needed the money, we needed the money,&quot; he kept muttering, as</p>
<p>he vainly tried to count the coins; and Saxon knew that his mind</p>
<p>was wandering again.</p>
<p>It cut her to the heart, for she could not but remember the harsh</p>
<p>thoughts that had threatened her loyalty during the week past.</p>
<p>After all, Billy, the splendid physical man, was only a boy, her</p>
<p>boy. And he had faced and endured all this terrible punishment</p>
<p>for her, for the house and tha furniture that were their house</p>
<p>and furniture. He said so, now, when he scarcely knew what he</p>
<p>said. He said &quot;WE needed the money.&quot; She was not so absent from</p>
<p>his thoughts as she had fancied. Here, down to the naked tie-ribs</p>
<p>of his soul, when he was half unconscious, the thought of her</p>
<p>persisted, was uppermost. We needed the money. WE!</p>
<p>The tears were trickling down her checks as she bent over him,</p>
<p>and it seemed she had never loved him so much as now.</p>
<p>&quot;Here; you count,&quot; he said, abandoning the effort and handing the</p>
<p>money to her. &quot;... How much do you make it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nineteen dollars and thirty-five cents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right ... the loser&#x27;s end ... twenty dollars. I had some</p>
<p>drinks, an&#x27; treated a couple of the boys, an&#x27; then there was</p>
<p>carfare. If I&#x27;d a-won, I&#x27;d a-got a hundred. That&#x27;s what I fought</p>
<p>for. It&#x27;d a-put us on Easy street for a while. You take it an&#x27;</p>
<p>keep it. It&#x27;s better &#x27;n nothin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>In bed, he could not sleep because of his pain, and hour by hour</p>
<p>she worked over him, renewing the hot compresses over his</p>
<p>bruises, soothing the lacerations with witch hazel and cold cream</p>
<p>and the tenderest of finger tips. And all the while, with broken</p>
<p>intervals of groaning, he babbled on, living over the fight,</p>
<p>seeking relief in telling her his trouble, voicing regret at loss</p>
<p>of the money, and crying out the hurt to his pride. Far worse</p>
<p>than the sum of his physical hurts was his hurt pride.</p>
<p>&quot;He couldn&#x27;t put me out, anyway. He had full swing at me in the</p>
<p>times when I was too much in to get my hands up. The crowd was</p>
<p>crazy. I showed &#x27;em some stamina. They was times when he only</p>
<p>rocked me, for I&#x27;d evaporated plenty of his steam for him in the</p>
<p>openin&#x27; rounds. I don&#x27;t know how many times he dropped me. things</p>
<p>was gettin&#x27; too dreamy ...</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, toward the end, I could see three of him in the ring</p>
<p>at once, an&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t know which to hit an&#x27; which to duck ...</p>
<p>&quot;But I fooled &#x27;m. When I couldn&#x27;t see, or feel, an&#x27; when my knees</p>
<p>was shakin an my head goin&#x27; like a merry-go-round, I&#x27;d fall safe</p>
<p>into clenches just the same. I bet the referee&#x27;s arms is tired</p>
<p>from draggin&#x27; us apart ...</p>
<p>&quot;But what a lacin&#x27;! What a lacin&#x27;! Say, Saxon ... where are you?</p>
<p>Oh, there, eh? I guess I was dreamin&#x27;. But, say, let this be a</p>
<p>lesson to you. I broke my word an&#x27; went fightin&#x27;, an&#x27; see what I</p>
<p>got. Look at me, an&#x27; take warnin&#x27; so you won&#x27;t make the same</p>
<p>mistake an&#x27; go to makin&#x27; an&#x27; sellin&#x27; fancy work again ...</p>
<p>&quot;But I fooled &#x27;em--everybody. At the beginnin&#x27; the bettin&#x27; was</p>
<p>even. By the sixth round the wise gazabos was offerin&#x27; two to one</p>
<p>against me. I was licked from the first drop outa the</p>
<p>box--anybody could see that; but he couldn&#x27;t put me down for the</p>
<p>count. By the tenth round they was offerin&#x27; even that I wouldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>last the round. At the eleventh they was offerin&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t last</p>
<p>the fifteenth. An&#x27; I lasted the whole twenty. But some</p>
<p>punishment, I want to tell you, some punishment.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, they was four rounds I was in dreamland all the time ...</p>
<p>only I kept on my feet an&#x27; fought, or took the count to eight an&#x27;</p>
<p>got up, an&#x27; stalled an&#x27; covered an&#x27; whanged away. I don&#x27;t know</p>
<p>what I done, except I must a-done like that, because I wasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>there. I don&#x27;t know a thing from the thirteenth, when he sent me</p>
<p>to the mat on my head, till the eighteenth.</p>
<p>&quot;Where was I? Oh, yes. I opened my eyes, or one eye, because I</p>
<p>had only one that would open. An&#x27; there I was, in my corner, with</p>
<p>the towels goin&#x27; an&#x27; ammonia in my nose an&#x27; Bill Murphy with a</p>
<p>chunk of ice at the back of my neck. An&#x27; there, across the ring,</p>
<p>I could see the Chicago Terror, an&#x27; I had to do some thinkin&#x27; to</p>
<p>remember I was fightin&#x27; him. It was like I&#x27;d been away somewhere</p>
<p>an&#x27; just got back. &#x27;What round&#x27;s this comin&#x27;?&#x27; I ask Bill. &#x27;The</p>
<p>eighteenth,&#x27; says he. &#x27;The hell,&#x27; I says. &#x27;What&#x27;s come of all the</p>
<p>other rounds? The last I was figlitin&#x27; in was the thirteenth.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;You&#x27;re a wonder,&#x27; says Bill. &#x27;You&#x27;ve ben out four rounds, only</p>
<p>nobody knows it except me. I&#x27;ve ben tryin&#x27; to get you to quit all</p>
<p>the time.&#x27; Just then the gong sounds, an&#x27; I can see the Terror</p>
<p>startin&#x27; for me. &#x27;Quit,&#x27; says Bill, makin&#x27; a move to throw in the</p>
<p>towel. &#x27;Not on your life,&#x27; I says. &#x27;Drop it, Bill.&#x27; But he went</p>
<p>on wantin&#x27; me to quit. By that time the Terror had come across to</p>
<p>my corner an&#x27; was standin&#x27; with his hands down, lookin&#x27; at me.</p>
<p>The referee was lookin&#x27;, too, an&#x27; the house was that quiet,</p>
<p>lookin&#x27;, you could hear a pin drop. An&#x27; my head was gettin&#x27; some</p>
<p>clearer, but not much.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You can&#x27;t win,&#x27; Bill says.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Watch me,&#x27; says I. An&#x27; with that I make a rush for the Terror,</p>
<p>catchin&#x27; him unexpeeted. I&#x27;m that groggy I can&#x27;t stand, but I</p>
<p>just keep a-goin&#x27;, wallopin&#x27; the Terror clear across the ring to</p>
<p>his corner, where he slips an&#x27; falls, an&#x27; I fall on top of &#x27;m.</p>
<p>Say, that crowd goes crazy.</p>
<p>&quot;Where was I?--My head&#x27;s still goin&#x27; round I guess. It&#x27;s buzzin&#x27;</p>
<p>like a swarm of bees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;d just fallen on top of him in his corner,&quot; Saxon prompted.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes. Well, no sooner are we on our feet--an&#x27; I can&#x27;t</p>
<p>stand--I rush &#x27;m the same way back across to my corner an&#x27; fall</p>
<p>on &#x27;m. That was luck. We got up, an&#x27; I&#x27;d a-fallen, only I</p>
<p>clenched an&#x27; held myself up by him. &#x27;I got your goat,&#x27; I says to</p>
<p>him. &#x27;An&#x27; now I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to eat you up.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I hadn&#x27;t his goat, but I was playin&#x27; to get a piece of it, an&#x27; I</p>
<p>got it, rushin&#x27; &#x27;m as soon as the referee drags us apart an&#x27;</p>
<p>fetchin&#x27; &#x27;m a lucky wallop in the stomach that steadied &#x27;m an&#x27;</p>
<p>made him almighty careful. Too almighty careful. He was afraid to</p>
<p>chance a mix with me. He thought I had more fight left in me than</p>
<p>I had. So you see I got that much of his goat anyway.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; he couldn&#x27;t get me. He didn&#x27;t get me. An&#x27; in the twentieth</p>
<p>we stood in the middle of the ring an&#x27; exchanged wallops even. Of</p>
<p>course, I&#x27;d made a fine showin&#x27; for a licked man, but he got the</p>
<p>decision, which was right. But I fooled &#x27;m. He couldn&#x27;t get me.</p>
<p>An&#x27; I fooled the gazabos that was bettin&#x27; he would on short</p>
<p>order.&quot;</p>
<p>At last, as dawn came on, Billy slept. He groaned and moaned, his</p>
<p>face twisting with pain, his body vainly moving and tossing in</p>
<p>quest of easement.</p>
<p>So this was prizefighting, Saxon thought. It was much worse than</p>
<p>she had dreamed. She had had no idea that such damage could be</p>
<p>wrought with padded gloves. He must never fight again. Street</p>
<p>rioting was preferable. She was wondering how much of his silk</p>
<p>had been lost, when he mumbled and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked, ere it came to her that his eyes were</p>
<p>unseeing and that he was in delirium.</p>
<p>&quot;Saxon! ... Saxon!&quot; he called.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Billy. What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>His hand fumbled over the bed where ordinarily it would have</p>
<p>encountered her.</p>
<p>Again he called her, and she cried her presence loudly in his</p>
<p>ear. He sighed with relief and muttered brokenly:</p>
<p>&quot;I had to do it. ... We needed the money.&quot;</p>
<p>His eyes closed, and he slept more soundly, though his muttering</p>
<p>continued. She had heard of congestion of the brain, and was</p>
<p>frightened. Then she remembered his telling her of the ice Billy</p>
<p>Murphy had held against his head.</p>
<p>Throwing a shawl over her head, she ran to the Pile Drivers&#x27; Home</p>
<p>on Seventh street. The barkeeper had just opened, and was</p>
<p>sweeping out. From the refrigerator he gave her all the ice she</p>
<p>wished to carry, breaking it into convenient pieces for her. Back</p>
<p>in the house, she applied the ice to the base of Billy&#x27;s brain,</p>
<p>placed hot irons to his feet, and bathed his head with witch</p>
<p>hazel made cold by resting on the ice.</p>
<p>He slept in the darkened room until late afternoon, when, to</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s dismay, he insisted on getting up.</p>
<p>&quot;Gotta make a showin&#x27;,&quot; he explained. &quot;They ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to have</p>
<p>the laugh on me.&quot;</p>
<p>In torment he was helped by her to dress, and in torment he went</p>
<p>forth from the house so that his world should have ocular</p>
<p>evidence that the beating he had received did not keep him in</p>
<p>bed.</p>
<p>It was another kind of pride, different from a woman&#x27;s, and Saxon</p>
<p>wondered if it were the less admirable for that.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>In the days that followed Billy&#x27;s swellings went down and the</p>
<p>bruises passed away with surprising rapidity. The quick healing</p>
<p>of the lacerations attested the healthiness of his blood. Only</p>
<p>remained the black eyes, unduly conspicuous on a face as blond as</p>
<p>his. The discoloration was stubborn, persisting half a month, in</p>
<p>which time happened divers events of importance.</p>
<p>Otto Frank&#x27;s trial had been expeditious. Found guilty by a jury</p>
<p>notable for the business and professional men on it, the death</p>
<p>sentence was passed upon him and he was removed to San Quentin</p>
<p>for execution.</p>
<p>The case of Chester Johnson and the fourteen others had taken</p>
<p>longer, but within the same week, it, too, was finished. Chester</p>
<p>Johnson was sentenced to be hanged. Two got life; three, twenty</p>
<p>years. Only two were acquitted. The remaining seven received</p>
<p>terms of from two to ten years.</p>
<p>The effect on Saxon was to throw her into deep depression. Billy</p>
<p>was made gloomy, but his fighting spirit was not subdued.</p>
<p>&quot;Always some men killed in battle,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s to be</p>
<p>expected. But the way of sentencin&#x27; &#x27;em gets me. All found guilty</p>
<p>was responsible for the killin&#x27;; or none was responsible. If all</p>
<p>was, then they should get the same sentence. They oughta hang</p>
<p>like Chester Johnson, or else he oughtn&#x27;t to hang. I&#x27;d just like</p>
<p>to know how the judge makes up his mind. It must be like markin&#x27;</p>
<p>China lottery tickets. He plays hunches. He looks at a guy an&#x27;</p>
<p>waits for a spot or a number to come into his head. How else</p>
<p>could he give Johnny Black four years an&#x27; Cal Hutchins twenty</p>
<p>years? He played the hunches as they came into his head, an&#x27; it</p>
<p>might just as easy ben the other way around an&#x27; Cal Hutchins got</p>
<p>four years an&#x27; Johnny Black twenty.</p>
<p>&quot;I know both them boys. They hung out with the Tenth an&#x27; Kirkham</p>
<p>gang mostly, though sometimes they ran with my gang. We used to</p>
<p>go swimmin&#x27; after school down to Sandy Beach on the marsh, an&#x27; in</p>
<p>the Transit slip where they said the water was sixty feet deep,</p>
<p>only it wasn&#x27;t. An&#x27; once, on a Thursday, we dug a lot of clams</p>
<p>together, an&#x27; played hookey Friday to peddle them. An&#x27; we used to</p>
<p>go out on the Rock Wall an&#x27; catch pogies an&#x27; rock cod. One</p>
<p>day--the day of the eclipse--Cal caught a perch half as big as a</p>
<p>door. I never seen such a fish. An&#x27; now he&#x27;s got to wear the</p>
<p>stripes for twenty years. Lucky he wasn&#x27;t married. If he don&#x27;t</p>
<p>get the consumption he&#x27;ll be an old man when he comes out. Cal&#x27;s</p>
<p>mother wouldn&#x27;t let &#x27;m go swimmin&#x27;, an&#x27; whenever she suspected</p>
<p>she always licked his hair with her tongue. If it tasted salty,</p>
<p>he got a beltin&#x27;. But he was onto himself. Comin&#x27; home, he&#x27;d jump</p>
<p>somebody&#x27;s front fence an&#x27; hold his head under a faucet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I used to dance with Chester Johnson,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;And I knew</p>
<p>his wife, Kittie Brady, long and long ago. She had next place at</p>
<p>the table to me in the paper-box factory. She&#x27;s gone to San</p>
<p>Francisco to her married sister&#x27;s. She&#x27;s going to have a baby,</p>
<p>too. She was awfully pretty, and there was always a string of</p>
<p>fellows after her.&quot;</p>
<p>The effect of the conviction and severe sentences was a bad one</p>
<p>on the union men. Instead of being disheartening, it intensified</p>
<p>the bitterness. Billy&#x27;s repentance for having fought and the</p>
<p>sweetness and affection which had flashed up in the days of</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s nursing of him were blotted out. At home, he scowled and</p>
<p>brooded, while his talk took on the tone of Bert&#x27;s in the last</p>
<p>days ere that Mohegan died. Also, Billy stayed away from home</p>
<p>longer hours, and was again steadily drinking.</p>
<p>Saxon well-nigh abandoned hope. Almost was she steeled to the</p>
<p>inevitable tragedy which her morbid fancy painted in a thousand</p>
<p>guises. Oftenest, it was of Billy being brought home on a</p>
<p>stretcher. Sometimes it was a call to the telephone in the corner</p>
<p>grocery and the curt information by a strange voice that her</p>
<p>husband was lying in the receiving hospital or the morgue. And</p>
<p>when the mysterious horse-poisoning cases occurred, and when the</p>
<p>residence of one of the teaming magnates was half destroyed by</p>
<p>dynamite, she saw Billy in prison, or wearing stripes, or</p>
<p>mounting to the scaffold at San Quentin while at the same time</p>
<p>she could see the little cottage on Pine street besieged by</p>
<p>newspaper reporters and photographers.</p>
<p>Yet her lively imagination failed altogether to anticipate the</p>
<p>real catastrophe. Harmon, the fireman lodger, passing through the</p>
<p>kitchen on his way out to work, had paused to tell Saxon about</p>
<p>the previous day&#x27;s train-wreck in the Alviso marshes, and of how</p>
<p>the engineer, imprisoned under the overturned engine and unhurt,</p>
<p>being drowned by the rising tide, had begged to be shot. Billy</p>
<p>came in at the end of the narrative, and from the somber light in</p>
<p>his heavy-lidded eyes Saxon knew he had been drinking. He</p>
<p>glowered at Harmon, and, without greeting to him or Saxon, leaned</p>
<p>his shoulder against the wall.</p>
<p>Harmon felt the awkwardness of the situation, and did his best to</p>
<p>appear oblivious.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just telling your wife--&quot; he began, but was savagely</p>
<p>interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care what you was tellin&#x27; her. But I got something to</p>
<p>tell you, Mister Man. My wife&#x27;s made up your bed too many times</p>
<p>to suit me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Billy!&quot; Saxon cried, her face scarlet with resentment, and hurt,</p>
<p>and shame.</p>
<p>Billy ignored her. Harmon was saying:</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t understand--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don&#x27;t like your mug,&quot; Billy informed him. &quot;You&#x27;re</p>
<p>standin&#x27; on your foot. Get off of it. Get out. Beat it. D&#x27;ye</p>
<p>understand that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s got into him,&quot; Saxon gasped hurriedly to the</p>
<p>fireman. &quot;He&#x27;s not himself. Oh, I am so ashamed, so ashamed.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy turned on her.</p>
<p>&quot;You shut your mouth an&#x27; keep outa this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, Billy,&quot; she remonstrated.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; get outa here. You go into the other room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here, now,&quot; Harmon broke in. &quot;This is a fine way to treat a</p>
<p>fellow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve given you too much rope as it is,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve paid my rent regularly, haven&#x27;t I?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I oughta knock your block off for you. Don&#x27;t see any reason</p>
<p>I shouldn&#x27;t, for that matter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you do anything like that, Billy--&quot; Saxon began.</p>
<p>&quot;You here still? Well, if you won&#x27;t go into the other room, I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>see that you do.&quot;</p>
<p>His hand clutched her arm. For one instant she resisted his</p>
<p>strength; and in that instant, the flesh crushed under his</p>
<p>fingers, she realized the fullness of his strength.</p>
<p>In the front room she could only lie back in the Morris chair</p>
<p>sobbing, and listen to what occurred in the kitchen. &quot;I&#x27;ll stay</p>
<p>to the end of the week,&quot; the fireman was saying. &quot;I&#x27;ve paid in</p>
<p>advance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t make no mistake,&quot; came Billy&#x27;s voice, so slow that it was</p>
<p>almost a drawl, yet quivering with rage. &quot;You can&#x27;t get out too</p>
<p>quick if you wanta stay healthy--you an&#x27; your traps with you. I&#x27;m</p>
<p>likely to start something any moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I know you&#x27;re a slugger--&quot; the fireman&#x27;s voice began.</p>
<p>Then came the unmistakable impact of a blow; the crash of glass;</p>
<p>a scuffle on the back porch; and, finally, the heavy bumps of a</p>
<p>body down the steps. She heard Billy reenter the kitchen, move</p>
<p>about, and knew he was sweeping up the broken glass of the</p>
<p>kitchen door. Then he washed himself at the sink, whistling while</p>
<p>he dried his face and hands, and walked into the front room. She</p>
<p>did not look at him. She was too sick and sad. He paused</p>
<p>irresolutely, seeming to make up his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m goin&#x27; up town,&quot; he stated. &quot;They&#x27;s a meeting of the union.</p>
<p>If I don&#x27;t come back it&#x27;ll be because that geezer&#x27;s sworn out a</p>
<p>warrant.&quot;</p>
<p>He opened the front door and paused. She knew he was looking at</p>
<p>her. Then the door closed and she heard him go down the steps.</p>
<p>Saxon was stunned. She did not think. She did not know what to</p>
<p>think. The whole thing was incomprehensible, incredible. She lay</p>
<p>back in the chair, her eyes closed, her mind almost a blank,</p>
<p>crushed by a leaden feeling that the end had come to everything.</p>
<p>The voices of children playing in the street aroused her. Night</p>
<p>had fallen. She groped her way to a lamp and lighted it. In the</p>
<p>kitchen she stared, lips trembling, at the pitiful, half prepared</p>
<p>meal. The fire had gone out. The water had boiled away from the</p>
<p>potatoes. When she lifted the lid, a burnt smell arose.</p>
<p>Methodically she scraped and cleaned the pot, put things in</p>
<p>order, and peeled and sliced the potatoes for next day&#x27;s frying.</p>
<p>And just as methodically she went to bed. Her lack of</p>
<p>nervousness, her placidity, was abnormal, so abnormal that she</p>
<p>closed her eyes and was almost immediately asleep. Nor did she</p>
<p>awaken till the sunshine was streaming into the room.</p>
<p>It was the first night she and Billy had slept apart. She was</p>
<p>amazed that she had not lain awake worrying about him. She lay</p>
<p>with eyes wide open, scarcely thinking, until pain in her arm</p>
<p>attracted her attention. It was where Billy had gripped her. On</p>
<p>examination she found the bruised flesh fearfully black and blue.</p>
<p>She was astonished, not by the spiritual fact that such bruise</p>
<p>had been administered by the one she loved most in the world, but</p>
<p>by the sheer physical fact that an instant&#x27;s pressure had</p>
<p>inflicted so much damage. The strength of a man was a terrible</p>
<p>thing. Quite impersonally, she found herself wondering if Charley</p>
<p>Long were as strong as Billy.</p>
<p>It was not until she dressed and built the fire that she began to</p>
<p>think about more immediate things. Billy had not returned. Then</p>
<p>he was arrested. What was she to do?--leave him in jail, go away,</p>
<p>and start life afresh? Of course it was impossible to go on</p>
<p>living with a man who had behaved as he had. But then, came</p>
<p>another thought, WAS it impossible? After all, he was her</p>
<p>husband. FOR BETTER OR WORSE--the phrase reiterated itself, a</p>
<p>monotonous accompaniment to her thoughts, at the back of her</p>
<p>consciousness. To leave him was to surrender. She carried the</p>
<p>matter before the tribunal of her mother&#x27;s memory. No; Daisy</p>
<p>would never have surrendered. Daisy was a fighter. Then she,</p>
<p>Saxon, must fight. Besides--and she acknowledged it--readily,</p>
<p>though in a cold, dead way--besides, Billy was better than most</p>
<p>husbands. Better than any other husband she had heard of, she</p>
<p>concluded, as she remembered many of his earlier nicenesses and</p>
<p>finenesses, and especially his eternal chant: NOTHING IS TOO GOOD</p>
<p>FOR US. THE ROBERTSES AIN&#x27;T ON THE CHEAP.</p>
<p>At eleven o&#x27;clock she had a caller. It was Bud Strothers, Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>mate on strike duty. Billy, he told her, had refused bail,</p>
<p>refused a lawyer, had asked to be tried by the Court, had pleaded</p>
<p>guilty, and had received a sentence of sixty dollars or thirty</p>
<p>days. Also, he had refused to let the boys pay his fine.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s clean looney,&quot; Strothers summed up. &quot;Won&#x27;t listen to</p>
<p>reason. Says he&#x27;ll serve the time out. He&#x27;s been tankin&#x27; up too</p>
<p>regular, I guess. His wheels are buzzin&#x27;. Here, he give me this</p>
<p>note for you. Any time you want anything send for me. The boys&#x27;ll</p>
<p>all stand by Bill&#x27;s wife. You belong to us, you know. How are you</p>
<p>off for money?&quot;</p>
<p>Proudly she disclaimed any need for money, and not until her</p>
<p>visitor departed did she read Billy&#x27;s note:</p>
<p>Dear Saxon--Bud Strothers is going to give you this. Don&#x27;t worry</p>
<p>about me. I am going to take my medicine. I deserve it--you know</p>
<p>that. I guess I am gone bughouse. Just the same, I am sorry for</p>
<p>what I done. Don&#x27;t come to see me. I don&#x27;t want you to. If you</p>
<p>need money, the union will give you some. The business agent is</p>
<p>all right. I will be out in a month. Now, Saxon, you know I love</p>
<p>you, and just say to yourself that you forgive me this time, and</p>
<p>you won&#x27;t never have to do it again.</p>

<p>Bud Strothers was followed by Maggie Donahue, and Mrs. Olsen, who</p>
<p>paid neighborly calls of cheer and were tactful in their offers</p>
<p>of help and in studiously avoiding more reference than was</p>
<p>necessary to Billy&#x27;s predicament.</p>
<p>In the afternoon James Harmon arrived. He limped slightly, and</p>
<p>Saxon divined that he was doing his best to minimize that</p>
<p>evidence of hurt. She tried to apologize to him, but he would not</p>
<p>listen.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t blame you, Mrs. Roberts,&quot; he said. &quot;I know it wasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>your doing. But your husband wasn&#x27;t just himself, I guess. He was</p>
<p>fightin&#x27; mad on general principles, and it was just my luck to</p>
<p>get in the way, that was all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But just the same--&quot;</p>
<p>The fireman shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;I know all about it. I used to punish the drink myself, and I</p>
<p>done some funny things in them days. And I&#x27;m sorry I swore that</p>
<p>warrant out and testified. But I was hot in the collar. I&#x27;m</p>
<p>cooled down now, an&#x27; I&#x27;m sorry I done it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re awfully good and kind,&quot; she said, and then began</p>
<p>hesitantly on what was bothering her. &quot;You ... you can&#x27;t stay</p>
<p>now, with him... away, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; that wouldn&#x27;t do, would it? I&#x27;ll tell you: I&#x27;ll pack up</p>
<p>right now, and skin out, and then, before six o&#x27;clock, I&#x27;ll send</p>
<p>a wagon for my things. Here&#x27;s the key to the kitchen door.&quot;</p>
<p>Much as he demurred, she compelled him to receive back the</p>
<p>unexpired portion of his rent. He shook her hand heartily at</p>
<p>leaving, and tried to get her to promise to call upon him for a</p>
<p>loan any time she might be in need.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right,&quot; he assured her. &quot;I&#x27;m married, and got two boys.</p>
<p>One of them&#x27;s got his lungs touched, and she&#x27;s with &#x27;em down in</p>
<p>Arizona campin&#x27; out. The railroad helped with passes.&quot;</p>
<p>And as he went down the steps she wondered that so kind a man</p>
<p>should be in so madly cruel a world.</p>
<p>The Donahue boy threw in a spare evening paper, and Saxon found</p>
<p>half a column devoted to Billy. It was not nice. The fact that he</p>
<p>had stood up in the police court with his eyes blacked from some</p>
<p>other fray was noted. He was described as a bully, a hoodlum, a</p>
<p>rough-neck, a professional slugger whose presence in the ranks</p>
<p>was a disgrace to organized labor. The assault he had pleaded</p>
<p>guilty of was atrocious and unprovoked, and if he were a fair</p>
<p>sample of a striking teamster, the only wise thing for Oakland to</p>
<p>do was to break up the union and drive every member from the</p>
<p>city. And, finally, the paper complained at the mildness of the</p>
<p>sentence. It should have been six months at least. The judge was</p>
<p>quoted as expressing regret that he had been unable to impose a</p>
<p>six months&#x27; sentence, this inability being due to the condition</p>
<p>of the jails, already crowded beyond capacity by the many eases</p>
<p>of assault committed in the course of the various strikes.</p>
<p>That night, in bed, Saxon experienced her first loneliness. Her</p>
<p>brain seemed in a whirl, and her sleep was broken by vain</p>
<p>gropings for the form of Billy she imagined at her side. At last,</p>
<p>she lighted the lamp and lay staring at the ceiling, wide-eyed,</p>
<p>conning over and over the details of the disaster that had</p>
<p>overwhelmed her. She could forgive, and she could not forgive.</p>
<p>The blow to her love-life had been too savage, too brutal. Her</p>
<p>pride was too lacerated to permit her wholly to return in memory</p>
<p>to the other Billy whom she loved. Wine in, wit out, she repeated</p>
<p>to herself; but the phrase could not absolve the man who had</p>
<p>slept by her side, and to whom she had consecrated herself. She</p>
<p>wept in the loneliness of the all-too-spacious bed, strove to</p>
<p>forget Billy&#x27;s incomprehensible cruelty, even pillowed her cheek</p>
<p>with numb fondness against the bruise of her arm; but still</p>
<p>resentment burned within her, a steady flame of protest against</p>
<p>Billy and all that Billy had done. Her throat was parched, a dull</p>
<p>ache never ceased in her breast, and she was oppressed by a</p>
<p>feeling of goneness. WHY, WHY?--And from the puzzle of the world</p>
<p>came no solution.</p>
<p>In the morning she received a visit from Sarah--the second in all</p>
<p>the period of her marriage; and she could easily guess her</p>
<p>sister-in-law&#x27;s ghoulish errand. No exertion was required for the</p>
<p>assertion of all of Saxon&#x27;s pride. She refused to be in the</p>
<p>slightest on the defensive. There was nothing to defend, nothing</p>
<p>to explain. Everything was all right, and it was nobody&#x27;s</p>
<p>business anyway. This attitude but served to vex Sarah.</p>
<p>&quot;I warned you, and you can&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t,&quot; her diatribe ran. &quot;I</p>
<p>always knew he was no good, a jailbird, a hoodlum, a slugger. My</p>
<p>heart sunk into my boots when I heard you was runnin&#x27; with a</p>
<p>prizefighter. I told you so at the time. But no; you wouldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>listen, you with your highfalutin&#x27; notions an&#x27; more pairs of</p>
<p>shoes than any decent woman should have. You knew better&#x27;n me.</p>
<p>An&#x27; I said then, to Tom, I said, &#x27;It&#x27;s all up with Saxon now.&#x27;</p>
<p>Them was my very words. Them that touches pitch is defiled. If</p>
<p>you&#x27;d only a-married Charley Long! Then the family wouldn&#x27;t a-ben</p>
<p>disgraced. An&#x27; this is only the beginnin&#x27;, mark me, only the</p>
<p>beginnin&#x27;. Where it&#x27;ll end, God knows. He&#x27;ll kill somebody yet,</p>
<p>that plug-ugly of yourn, an&#x27; be hanged for it. You wait an&#x27; see,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s all, an&#x27; then you&#x27;ll remember my words. As you make your</p>
<p>bed, so you will lay in it&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Best bed I ever had,&quot; Saxon commented.</p>
<p>&quot;So you can say, so you can say,&quot; Sarah snorted.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for a queen&#x27;s bed,&quot; Saxon added.</p>
<p>&quot;A jailbird&#x27;s bed,&quot; Sarah rejoined witheringly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s the style,&quot; Saxon retorted airily. &quot;Everybody&#x27;s getting</p>
<p>a taste of jail. Wasn&#x27;t Tom arrested at some street meeting of</p>
<p>the socialists? Everybody goes to jail these days.&quot;</p>
<p>The barb had struck home.</p>
<p>&quot;But Tom was acquitted,&quot; Sarah hastened to proclaim.</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same he lay in jail all night without bail.&quot;</p>
<p>This was unanswerable, and Sarah executed her favorite tactic of</p>
<p>attack in flank.</p>
<p>&quot;A nice come-down for you, I must say, that was raised straight</p>
<p>an&#x27; right, a-cuttin&#x27; up didoes with a lodger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who says so?&quot; Saxon blazed with an indignation quickly mastered.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, a blind man can read between the lines. A lodger, a young</p>
<p>married woman with no self respect, an&#x27; a prizefighter for a</p>
<p>husband--what else would they fight about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just like any family quarrel, wasn&#x27;t it?&quot; Saxon smiled placidly.</p>
<p>Sarah was shocked into momentary speechlessness.</p>
<p>&quot;And I want you to understand it,&quot; Saxon continued. &quot;It makes a</p>
<p>woman proud to have men fight over her. I am proud. Do you hear?</p>
<p>I am proud. I want you to tell them so. I want you to tell all</p>
<p>your neighbors. Tell everybody. I am no cow. Men like me. Men</p>
<p>fight for me. Men go to jail for me. What is a woman in the world</p>
<p>for, if it isn&#x27;t to have men like her? Now, go, Sarah; go at</p>
<p>once, and tell everybody what you&#x27;ve read between the lines. Tell</p>
<p>them Billy is a jailbird and that I am a bad woman whom all men</p>
<p>desire. Shout it out, and good luck to you. And get out of my</p>
<p>house. And never put your feet in it again. You are too decent a</p>
<p>woman to come here. You might lose your reputation. And think of</p>
<p>your children. Now get out. Go.&quot;</p>
<p>Not until Sarah had taken an amazed and horrified departure did</p>
<p>Saxon fling herself on the bed in a convulsion of tears. She had</p>
<p>been ashamed, before, merely of Billy&#x27;s inhospitality, and</p>
<p>surliness, and unfairness. But she could see, now, the light in</p>
<p>which others looked on the affair. It had not entered Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>head. She was confident that it had not entered Billy&#x27;s. She knew</p>
<p>his attitude from the first. Always he had opposed taking a</p>
<p>lodger because of his proud faith that his wife should not work.</p>
<p>Only hard times had compelled his consent, and, now that she</p>
<p>looked back, almost had she inveigled him into consenting.</p>
<p>But all this did not alter the viewpoint the neighborhood must</p>
<p>hold, that every one who had ever known her must hold. And for</p>
<p>this, too, Billy was responsible. It was more terrible than all</p>
<p>the other things he had been guilty of put together. She could</p>
<p>never look any one in the face again. Maggie Donahue and Mrs.</p>
<p>Olsen had been very kind, but of what must they have been</p>
<p>thinking all the time they talked with her? And what must they</p>
<p>have said to each other? What was everybody saying?--over front</p>
<p>gates and back fences,--the men standing on the corners or</p>
<p>talking in saloons?</p>
<p>Later, exhausted by her grief, when the tears no longer fell, she</p>
<p>grew more impersonal, and dwelt on the disasters that had</p>
<p>befallen so many women since the strike troubles began--Otto</p>
<p>Frank&#x27;s wife, Henderson&#x27;s widow, pretty Kittie Brady, Mary, all</p>
<p>the womenfolk of the other workmen who were now wearing the</p>
<p>stripes in San Quentin. Her world was crashing about her ears. No</p>
<p>one was exempt. Not only had she not escaped, but hers was the</p>
<p>worst disgrace of all. Desperately she tried to hug the delusion</p>
<p>that she was asleep, that it was all a nightmare, and that soon</p>
<p>the alarm would go off and she would get up and cook Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>breakfast so that he could go to work.</p>
<p>She did not leave the bed that day. Nor did she sleep. Her brain</p>
<p>whirled on and on, now dwelling at insistent length upon her</p>
<p>misfortunes, now pursuing the most fantastic ramifications of</p>
<p>what she considered her disgrace, and, again, going back to her</p>
<p>childhood and wandering through endless trivial detail. She</p>
<p>worked at all the tasks she had ever done, performing, in fancy,</p>
<p>the myriads of mechanical movements peculiar to each</p>
<p>occupation--shaping and pasting in the paper box factory, ironing</p>
<p>in the laundry, weaving in the jute mill, peeling fruit in the</p>
<p>cannery and countless boxes of scalded tomatoes. She attended all</p>
<p>her dances and all her picnics over again; went through her</p>
<p>school days, recalling the face and name and seat of every</p>
<p>schoolmate; endured the gray bleakness of the years in the orphan</p>
<p>asylum; revisioned every memory of her mother, every tale; and</p>
<p>relived all her life with Billy. But ever--and here the torment</p>
<p>lay--she was drawn back from these far-wanderings to her present</p>
<p>trouble, with its parch in the throat, its ache in the breast,</p>
<p>and its gnawing, vacant goneness.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV</p>
<p>All that night Saxon lay, unsleeping, without taking off her</p>
<p>clothes, and when she arose in the morning and washed her face</p>
<p>and dressed her hair she was aware of a strange numbness, of a</p>
<p>feeling of constriction about her head as if it were bound by a</p>
<p>heavy band of iron. It seemed like a dull pressure upon her</p>
<p>brain. It was the beginning of an illness that she did not know</p>
<p>as illness. All she knew was that she felt queer. It was not</p>
<p>fever. It was not cold. Her bodily health was as it should be,</p>
<p>and, when she thought about it, she put her condition down to</p>
<p>nerves--nerves, according to her ideas and the ideas of her</p>
<p>class, being unconnected with disease.</p>
<p>She had a strange feeling of loss of self, of being a stranger to</p>
<p>herself, and the world in which she moved seemed a vague and</p>
<p>shrouded world. It lacked sharpness of definition. Its customary</p>
<p>vividness was gone. She had lapses of memory, and was continually</p>
<p>finding herself doing unplanned things. Thus, to her</p>
<p>astonishment, she came to in the back yard hanging up the week&#x27;s</p>
<p>wash. She had no recollection of having done it, yet it had been</p>
<p>done precisely as it should have been done. She had boiled the</p>
<p>sheets and pillow-slips and the table linen. Billy&#x27;s woolens had</p>
<p>been washed in warm water only, with the home-made soap, the</p>
<p>recipe of which Mercedes had given her. On investigation, she</p>
<p>found she had eaten a mutton chop for breakfast. This meant that</p>
<p>she had been to the butcher shop, yet she had no memory of having</p>
<p>gone. Curiously, she went into the bedroom. The bed was made up</p>
<p>and everything in order.</p>
<p>At twilight she came upon herself in the front room, seated by</p>
<p>the window, crying in an ecstasy of joy. At first she did not</p>
<p>know what this joy was; then it came to her that it was because</p>
<p>she had lost her baby. &quot;A blessing, a blessing,&quot; she was chanting</p>
<p>aloud, wringing her hands, but with joy, she knew it was with joy</p>
<p>that she wrung her hands.</p>
<p>The days came and went. She had little notion of time. Sometimes,</p>
<p>centuries agone, it seemed to her it was since Billy had gone to</p>
<p>jail. At other times it was no more than the night before. But</p>
<p>through it all two ideas persisted: she must not go to see Billy</p>
<p>in jail; it was a blessing she had lost her baby.</p>
<p>Once, Bud Strothers came to see her. She sat in the front room</p>
<p>and talked with him, noting with fascination that there were</p>
<p>fringes to the heels of his trousers. Another day, the business</p>
<p>agent of the union called. She told him, as she had told Bud</p>
<p>Strothers, that everything was all right, that she needed</p>
<p>nothing, that she could get along comfortably until Billy came</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>A fear began to haunt her. WHEN HE CAME OUT. No; it must not be.</p>
<p>There must not be another baby. It might LIVE. No, no, a thousand</p>
<p>times no. It must not be. She would run away first. She would</p>
<p>never see Billy again. Anything but that. Anything but that.</p>
<p>This fear persisted. In her nightmare-ridden sleep it became an</p>
<p>accomplished fact, so that she would awake, trembling, in a cold</p>
<p>sweat, crying out. Her sleep had become wretched. Sometimes she</p>
<p>was convinced that she did not sleep at all, and she knew that</p>
<p>she had insomnia, and remembered that it was of insomnia her</p>
<p>mother had died.</p>
<p>She came to herself one day, sitting in Doctor Hentley&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>He was looking at her in a puzzled way.</p>
<p>&quot;Got plenty to eat?&quot; he was asking.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Any serious trouble?&quot;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything&#x27;s all right, doctor . . . except . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he encouraged.</p>
<p>And then she knew why she had come. Simply, explicitly,she told</p>
<p>him. He shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;It can&#x27;t be done, little woman,&quot; he said</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but it can!&quot; she cried. &quot;I know it can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t mean that,&quot; he answered. &quot;I mean I can&#x27;t tell you. I</p>
<p>dare not. It is against the law. There is a doctor in Leavenworth</p>
<p>prison right now for that.&quot;</p>
<p>In vain she pleaded with him. He instanced his own wife and</p>
<p>children whose existence forbade his imperiling</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, there is no likelihood now,&quot; he told her.</p>
<p>&quot;But there will be, there is sure to be,&quot; she urged.</p>
<p>But he could only shake his head sadly.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you want to know?&quot; he questioned finally.</p>
<p>Saxon poured her heart out to him. She told of her first year of</p>
<p>happiness with Billy, of the hard times caused by the labor</p>
<p>troubles, of the change in Billy so that there was no love-life</p>
<p>left, of her own deep horror. Not if it died, she concluded. She</p>
<p>could go through that again. But if it should live. Billy would</p>
<p>soon be out of jail, and then the danger would begin. It was only</p>
<p>a few words. She would never tell any one. Wild horses could not</p>
<p>drag it out of her.</p>
<p>But Doctor Hentley continued to shake his head. &quot;I can&#x27;t tell</p>
<p>you, little woman. It&#x27;s a shame, but I can&#x27;t take the risk. My</p>
<p>hands are tied. Our laws are all wrong. I have to consider those</p>
<p>who are dear to me.&quot;</p>
<p>It was when she got up to go that he faltered. &quot;Come here,&quot; he</p>
<p>said. &quot;Sit closer.&quot;</p>
<p>He prepared to whisper in her ear, then, with a sudden excess of</p>
<p>caution, crossed the room swiftly, opened the door, and looked</p>
<p>out. When he sat down again he drew his chair so close to hers</p>
<p>that the arms touched, and when he whispered his beard tickled</p>
<p>her ear.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; he shut her off when she tried to voice her gratitude.</p>
<p>&quot;I have told you nothing. You were here to consult me about your</p>
<p>general health. You are run down, out of condition--&quot;</p>
<p>As he talked he moved her toward the door. When he opened it, a</p>
<p>patient for the dentist in the adjoining office was standing in</p>
<p>the hall. Doctor Hentley lifted his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;What you need is that tonic I prescribed. Remember that. And</p>
<p>don&#x27;t pamper your appetite when it comes back. Eat strong,</p>
<p>nourishing food, and beefsteak, plenty of beefsteak. And don&#x27;t</p>
<p>cook it to a cinder. Good day.&quot;</p>
<p>At times the silent cottage became unendurable, and Saxon would</p>
<p>throw a shawl about her head and walk out the Oakland Mole, or</p>
<p>cross the railroad yards and the marshes to Sandy Beach where</p>
<p>Billy had said he used to swim. Also, by going out the Transit</p>
<p>slip, by climbing down the piles on a precarious ladder of iron</p>
<p>spikes, and by crossing a boom of logs, she won access to the</p>
<p>Rock Wall that extended far out into the bay and that served as a</p>
<p>barrier between the mudflats and the tide-scoured channel of</p>
<p>Oakland Estuary. Here the fresh sea breezes blew and Oakland sank</p>
<p>down to a smudge of smoke behind her, while across the bay she</p>
<p>could see the smudge that represented San Francisco. Ocean</p>
<p>steamships passed up and down the estuary, and lofty-masted</p>
<p>ships, towed by red-stacked tugs.</p>
<p>She gazed at the sailors on the ships, wondered on what far</p>
<p>voyages and to what far lands they went, wondered what freedoms</p>
<p>were theirs. Or were they girt in by as remorseless and cruel a</p>
<p>world as the dwellers in Oakland were? Were they as unfair, as</p>
<p>unjust, as brutal, in their dealings with their fellows as were</p>
<p>the city dwellers? It did not seem so, and sometimes she wished</p>
<p>herself on board, out-bound, going anywhere, she cared not where,</p>
<p>so long as it was away from the world to which she had given her</p>
<p>best and which had trampled her in return.</p>
<p>She did not know always when she left the house, nor where her</p>
<p>feet took her. Once, she came to herself in a strange part of</p>
<p>Oakland. The street was wide and lined with rows of shade trees.</p>
<p>Velvet lawns, broken only by cement sidewalks, ran down to the</p>
<p>gutters. The houses stood apart and were large. In her vocabulary</p>
<p>they were mansions. What had shocked her to consciousness of</p>
<p>herself was a young man in the driver&#x27;s seat of a touring car</p>
<p>standing at the curb. He was looking at her curiously and she</p>
<p>recognized him as Roy Blanchard, whom, in front of the Forum,</p>
<p>Billy had threatened to whip. Beside the car, bareheaded, stood</p>
<p>another young man. He, too, she remembered. He it was, at the</p>
<p>Sunday picnic where she first met Billy, who had thrust his cane</p>
<p>between the legs of the flying foot-racer and precipitated the</p>
<p>free-for-all fight. Like Blanchard, he was looking at her</p>
<p>curiously, and she became aware that she had been talking to</p>
<p>herself. The babble of her lips still beat in her ears. She</p>
<p>blushed, a rising tide of shame heating her face, and quickened</p>
<p>her pace. Blanchard sprang out of the car and came to her with</p>
<p>lifted hat. &quot;Is anything the matter?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head, and, though she had stopped, she evinced her</p>
<p>desire to go on.</p>
<p>&quot;I know you,&quot; he said, studying her face. &quot;You were with the</p>
<p>striker who promised me a licking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is my husband,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Good for him.&quot; He regarded her pleasantly and frankly. &quot;But</p>
<p>about yourself? Isn&#x27;t there anything I can do for you? Something</p>
<p>IS the matter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I&#x27;m all right,&quot; she answered. &quot;I have been sick,&quot; she lied;</p>
<p>for she never dreamed of connecting her queerness with sickness.</p>
<p>&quot;You look tired,&quot; he pressed her. &quot;I can take you in the machine</p>
<p>and run you anywhere you want. It won&#x27;t be any trouble. I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>plenty of time.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;If... if you would tell me where I can catch the Eighth street</p>
<p>cars. I don&#x27;t often come to this part of town.&quot;</p>
<p>He told her where to find an electric car and what transfers to</p>
<p>make, and she was surprised at the distance she had wandered.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;And good bye.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure I can&#x27;t do anything now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, good bye,&quot; he smiled good humoredly. &quot;And tell that</p>
<p>husband of yours to keep in good condition. I&#x27;m likely to make</p>
<p>him need it all when he tangles up with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but you can&#x27;t fight with him,&quot; she warned. &quot;You mustn&#x27;t. You</p>
<p>haven&#x27;t got a show.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good for you,&quot; he admired. &quot;That&#x27;s the way for a woman to stand</p>
<p>up for her man. Now the average woman would be so afraid he was</p>
<p>going to get licked--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I&#x27;m not afraid. .. for him. It&#x27;s for you. He&#x27;s a terrible</p>
<p>fighter. You wouldn&#x27;t have any chance. It would be like....</p>
<p>like....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like taking candy from a baby?&quot; Blanchard finished for her.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she nodded. &quot;That&#x27;s just what he would call it. And</p>
<p>whenever he tells you you are standing on your foot watch out for</p>
<p>him. Now I must go. Good bye, and thank you again.&quot;</p>
<p>She went on down the sidewalk, his cheery good bye ringing in her</p>
<p>ears. He was kind--she admitted it honestly; yet he was one of</p>
<p>the clever ones, one of the masters, who, according to Billy,</p>
<p>were responsible for all the cruelty to labor, for the hardships</p>
<p>of the women, for the punishment of the labor men who were</p>
<p>wearing stripes in San Quentin or were in the death cells</p>
<p>awaiting the scaffold. Yet he was kind, sweet natured, clean,</p>
<p>good. She could read his character in his face. But how could</p>
<p>this be, if he were responsible for so much evil? She shook her</p>
<p>head wearily. There was no explanation, no understanding of this</p>
<p>world which destroyed little babes and bruised women&#x27;s breasts.</p>
<p>As for her having strayed into that neighborhood of fine</p>
<p>residences, she was unsurprised. It was in line with her</p>
<p>queerness. She did so many things without knowing that she did</p>
<p>them. But she must be careful. It was better to wander on the</p>
<p>marshes and the Rock Wall.</p>
<p>Especially she liked the Rock Wall. There was a freedom about it,</p>
<p>a wide spaciousness that she found herself instinctively trying</p>
<p>to breathe, holding her arms out to embrace and make part of</p>
<p>herself. It was a more natural world, a more rational world. She</p>
<p>could understand it--understand the green crabs with white-</p>
<p>bleached claws that scuttled before her and which she could see</p>
<p>pasturing on green-weeded rocks when the tide was low. Here,</p>
<p>hopelessly man-made as the great wall was, nothing seemed</p>
<p>artificial. There were no men here, no laws nor conflicts of men.</p>
<p>The tide flowed and ebbed; the sun rose and set; regularly each</p>
<p>afternoon the brave west wind came romping in through the Golden</p>
<p>Gate, darkening the water, cresting tiny wavelets, making the</p>
<p>sailboats fly. Everything ran with frictionless order. Everything</p>
<p>was free. Firewood lay about for the taking. No man sold it by</p>
<p>the sack. Small boys fished with poles from the rocks, with no</p>
<p>one to drive them away for trespass, catching fish as Billy had</p>
<p>caught fish, as Cal Hutchins had caught fish. Billy had told her</p>
<p>of the great perch Cal Hutchins caught on the day of the eclipse,</p>
<p>when he had little dreamed the heart of his manhood would be</p>
<p>spent in convict&#x27;s garb.</p>
<p>And here was food, food that was free. She watched the small boys</p>
<p>on a day when she had eaten nothing, and emulated them, gathering</p>
<p>mussels from the rocks at low water, cooking them by placing them</p>
<p>among the coals of a fire she built on top of the wall. They</p>
<p>tasted particularly good. She learned to knock the small oysters</p>
<p>from the rocks, and once she found a string of fresh-caught fish</p>
<p>some small boy had forgotten to take home with him.</p>
<p>Here drifted evidences of man&#x27;s sinister handiwork--from a</p>
<p>distance, from the cities. One flood tide she found the water</p>
<p>covered with muskmelons. They bobbed and bumped along up the</p>
<p>estuary in countless thousands. Where they stranded against the</p>
<p>rocks she was able to get them. But each and every melon--and she</p>
<p>patiently tried scores of them--had been spoiled by a sharp gash</p>
<p>that let in the salt water. She could not understand. She asked</p>
<p>an old Portuguese woman gathering driftwood.</p>
<p>&quot;They do it, the people who have too much,&quot; the old woman</p>
<p>explained, straightening her labor-stiffened back with such an</p>
<p>effort that almost Saxon could hear it creak. The old woman&#x27;s</p>
<p>black eyes flashed angrily, and her wrinkled lips, drawn tightly</p>
<p>across toothless gums, wry with bitterness. &quot;The people that have</p>
<p>too much. It is to keep up the price. They throw them overboard</p>
<p>in San Francisco.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But why don&#x27;t they give them away to the poor people?&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>asked.</p>
<p>&quot;They must keep up the price.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the poor people cannot buy them anyway,&quot; Saxon objected. &quot;It</p>
<p>would not hurt the price.&quot;</p>
<p>The old woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know. It is their way. They chop each melon so that the</p>
<p>poor people cannot fish them out and eat anyway. They do the same</p>
<p>with the oranges, with the apples. Ah, the fishermen! There is a</p>
<p>trust. When the boats catch too much fish, the trust throws them</p>
<p>overboard from Fisherman Wharf, boat-loads, and boat-loads, and</p>
<p>boatloads of the beautiful fish. And the beautiful good fish sink</p>
<p>and are gone. And no one gets them. Yet they are dead and only</p>
<p>good to eat. Fish are very good to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>And Saxon could not understand a world that did such things--a</p>
<p>world in which some men possessed so much food that they threw it</p>
<p>away, paying men for their labor of spoiling it before they threw</p>
<p>it away; and in the same world so many people who did not have</p>
<p>enough food, whose babies died because their mothers&#x27; milk was</p>
<p>not nourishing, whose young men fought and killed one another for</p>
<p>the chance to work, whose old men and women went to the poorhouse</p>
<p>because there was no food for them in the little shacks they wept</p>
<p>at leaving. She wondered if all the world were that way, and</p>
<p>remembered Mercedes&#x27; tales. Yes; all the world was that way. Had</p>
<p>not Mercedes seen ten thousand families starve to death in that</p>
<p>far away India, when, as she had said, her own jewels that she</p>
<p>wore would have fed and saved them all? It was the poorhouse and</p>
<p>the salt vats for the stupid, jewels and automobiles for the</p>
<p>clever ones.</p>
<p>She was one of the stupid. She must be. The evidence all pointed</p>
<p>that way. Yet Saxon refused to accept it. She was not stupid. Her</p>
<p>mother had not been stupid, nor had the pioneer stock before her.</p>
<p>Still it must be so. Here she sat, nothing to eat at home, her</p>
<p>love-husband changed to a brute beast and lying in jail, her arms</p>
<p>and heart empty of the babe that would have been there if only</p>
<p>the stupid ones had not made a shambles of her front yard in</p>
<p>their wrangling over jobs.</p>
<p>She sat there, racking her brain, the smudge of Oakland at her</p>
<p>back, staring across the bay at the smudge of Ban Francisco. Yet</p>
<p>the sun was good; the wind was good, as was the keen salt air in</p>
<p>her nostrils; the blue sky, flecked with clouds, was good. All</p>
<p>the natural world was right, and sensible, and beneficent. It was</p>
<p>the man-world that was wrong, and mad, and horrible. Why were the</p>
<p>stupid stupid? Was it a law of God? No; it could not be. God had</p>
<p>made the wind, and air, and sun. The man-world was made by man,</p>
<p>and a rotten job it was. Yet, and she remembered it well, the</p>
<p>teaching in the orphan asylum, God had made everything. Her</p>
<p>mother, too, had believed this, had believed in this God. Things</p>
<p>could not be different. It was ordained.</p>
<p>For a time Saxon sat crushed, helpless. Then smoldered protest,</p>
<p>revolt. Vainly she asked why God had it in for her. What had she</p>
<p>done to deserve such fate? She briefly reviewed her life in quest</p>
<p>of deadly sins committed, and found them not. She had obeyed her</p>
<p>mother; obeyed Cady, the saloon-keeper, and Cady&#x27;s wife; obeyed</p>
<p>the matron and the other women in the orphan asylum; obeyed Tom</p>
<p>when she came to live in his house, and never run in the streets</p>
<p>because he didn&#x27;t wish her to. At school she had always been</p>
<p>honorably promoted, and never had her deportment report varied</p>
<p>from one hundred per cent. She had worked from the day she left</p>
<p>school to the day of her marriage. She had been a good worker,</p>
<p>too. The little Jew who ran the paper box factory had almost wept</p>
<p>when she quit. It was the same at the cannery. She was among the</p>
<p>high-line weavers when the jute mills closed down. I And she had</p>
<p>kept straight. It was not as if she had been ugly or</p>
<p>unattractive. She had known her temptations and encountered her</p>
<p>dangers. The fellows had been crazy about her. They had run after</p>
<p>her, fought over her, in a way to turn most girls&#x27; heads. But she</p>
<p>had kept straight. And then had come Billy, her reward. She had</p>
<p>devoted herself to him, to his house, to all that would nourish</p>
<p>his love; and now she and Billy were sinking down into this</p>
<p>senseless vortex of misery and heartbreak of the man-made world.</p>
<p>No, God was not responsible. She could have made a better world</p>
<p>herself--a finer, squarer world. This being so, then there was no</p>
<p>God. God could not make a botch. The matron had been wrong, her</p>
<p>mother had been wrong. Then there was no immortality, and Bert,</p>
<p>wild and crazy Bert, falling at her front gate with his foolish</p>
<p>death-cry, was right. One was a long time dead.</p>
<p>Looking thus at life, shorn of its superrational sanctions, Saxon</p>
<p>floundered into the morass of pessimism. There was no</p>
<p>justification for right conduct in the universe, no square</p>
<p>deal for her who had earned reward, for the millions who worked</p>
<p>like animals, died like animals, and were a long time and forever</p>
<p>dead. Like the hosts of more learned thinkers before her, she</p>
<p>concluded that the universe was unmoral and without concern for</p>
<p>men.</p>
<p>And now she sat crushed in greater helplessness than when she had</p>
<p>included God in the scheme of injustice. As long as God was,</p>
<p>there was always chance for a miracle, for some supernatural</p>
<p>intervention, some rewarding with ineffable bliss. With God</p>
<p>missing, the world was a trap. Life was a trap. She was like a</p>
<p>linnet, caught by small boys and imprisoned in a cage. That was</p>
<p>because the linnet was stupid. But she rebelled. She fluttered</p>
<p>and beat her soul against the hard face of things as did the</p>
<p>linnet against the bars of wire. She was not stupid. She did not</p>
<p>belong in the trap. She would fight her way out of the trap.</p>
<p>There must be such a way out. When canal boys and rail-splitters,</p>
<p>the lowliest of the stupid lowly, as she had read in her school</p>
<p>history, could find their way out and become presidents of the</p>
<p>nation and rule over even the clever ones in their automobiles,</p>
<p>then could she find her way out and win to the tiny reward she</p>
<p>craved--Billy, a little love, a little happiness. She would not</p>
<p>mind that the universe was unmoral, that there was no God, no</p>
<p>immortality. She was willing to go into the black grave and</p>
<p>remain in its blackness forever, to go into the salt vats and let</p>
<p>the young men cut her dead flesh to sausage-meat, if--if only she</p>
<p>could get her small meed of happiness first.</p>
<p>How she would work for that happiness! How she would appreciate</p>
<p>it, make the most of each least particle of it! But how was she</p>
<p>to do it, Where was the paths She could not vision it. Her eyes</p>
<p>showed her only the smudge of San Francisco, the smudge of</p>
<p>Oakland, where men were breaking heads and killing one another,</p>
<p>where babies were dying, born and unborn, and where women were</p>
<p>weeping with bruised breasts.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI</p>
<p>Her vague, unreal existence continued. It seemed in some previous</p>
<p>life-time that Billy had gone away, that another life-time would</p>
<p>have to come before he returned. She still suffered from</p>
<p>insomnia. Long nights passed in succession, during which she</p>
<p>never closed her eyes. At other times she slept through long</p>
<p>stupors, waking stunned and numbed, scarcely able to open her</p>
<p>heavy eyes, to move her weary limbs. The pressure of the iron</p>
<p>band on her head never relaxed. She was poorly nourished. Nor had</p>
<p>she a cent of money. She often went a whole day without eating.</p>
<p>Once, seventy-two hours elapsed without food passing her lips.</p>
<p>She dug clams in the marsh, knocked the tiny oysters from the</p>
<p>rocks, and gathered mussels.</p>
<p>And yet, when Bud Strothers came to see how she was getting</p>
<p>along, she convinced him that all was well. One evening after</p>
<p>work, Tom came, and forced two dollars upon her. He was terribly</p>
<p>worried. He would like to help more, but Sarah was expecting</p>
<p>another baby. There had been slack times in his trade because of</p>
<p>the strikes in the other trades. He did not know what the country</p>
<p>was coming to. And it was all so simple. All they had to do was</p>
<p>see things in his way and vote the way he voted. Then everybody</p>
<p>would get a square deal. Christ was a Socialist, he told her.</p>
<p>&quot;Christ died two thousand years ago,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; Tom queried, not catching her implication.</p>
<p>&quot;Think,&quot; she said, &quot;think of all the men and women who died in</p>
<p>those two thousand years, and socialism has not come yet. And in</p>
<p>two thousand years more it may be as far away as ever. Tom, your</p>
<p>socialism never did you any good. It is a dream.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It wouldn&#x27;t be if--&quot; he began with a flash of resentment.</p>
<p>&quot;If they believed as you do. Only they don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t succeed</p>
<p>in making them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we are increasing every year,&quot; he argued.</p>
<p>&quot;Two thousand years is an awfully long time,&quot; she said quietly.</p>
<p>Her brother&#x27;s tired face saddened as he noted. Then he sighed:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Saxon, if it&#x27;s a dream, it is a good dream.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t want to dream,&quot; was her reply. &quot;I want things real. I</p>
<p>want them now.&quot;</p>
<p>And before her fancy passed the countless generations of the</p>
<p>stupid lowly, the Billys and Saxons, the Berts and Marys, the</p>
<p>Toms and Sarahs. And to what end? The salt vats and the grave.</p>
<p>Mercedes was a hard and wicked woman, but Mercedes was right. The</p>
<p>stupid must always be under the heels of the clever ones. Only</p>
<p>she, Saxon, daughter of Daisy who had written wonderful poems and</p>
<p>of a soldier-father on a roan war-horse, daughter of the strong.</p>
<p>generations who hall won half a world from wild nature and the</p>
<p>savage Indian--no, she was not stupid. It was as if she suffered</p>
<p>false imprisonment. There was some mistake. She would find the</p>
<p>way out.</p>
<p>With the two dollars she bought a sack of flour and half a sack</p>
<p>of potatoes. This relieved the monotony of her clams and mussels.</p>
<p>Like the Italian and Portuguese women, she gathered driftwood and</p>
<p>carried it home, though always she did it with shamed pride,</p>
<p>timing her arrival so that it would be after dark. One day, on</p>
<p>the mud-flat side of the Rock Wall, an Italian fishing boat</p>
<p>hauled up on the sand dredged from the channel. From the top of</p>
<p>the wall Saxon watched the men grouped about the charcoal</p>
<p>brazier, eating crusty Italian bread and a stew of meat and</p>
<p>vegetables, washed down with long draughts of thin red wine. She</p>
<p>envied them their freedom that advertised itself in the</p>
<p>heartiness of their meal, in the tones of their chatter and</p>
<p>laughter, in the very boat itself that was not tied always to one</p>
<p>place and that carried them wherever they willed. Afterward, they</p>
<p>dragged a seine across the mud-flats and up on the sand,</p>
<p>selecting for themselves only the larger kinds of fish. Many</p>
<p>thousands of small fish, like sardines, they left dying on the</p>
<p>sand when they sailed away. Saxon got a sackful of the fish, and</p>
<p>was compelled to make two trips in order to carry them home,</p>
<p>where she salted them down in a wooden washtubs</p>
<p>Her lapses of consciousness continued. The strangest thing she</p>
<p>did while in such condition was on Sandy Beach. There she</p>
<p>discovered herself, one windy afternoon, lying in a hole she had</p>
<p>dug, with sacks for blankets. She had even roofed the hole in</p>
<p>rough fashion by means of drift wood and marsh grass. On top of</p>
<p>the grass she had piled sand.</p>
<p>Another time she came to herself walking across the  marshes, a</p>
<p>bundle of driftwood, tied with bale-rope, on her shoulder.</p>
<p>Charley Long was walking beside her. She could see his face in</p>
<p>the starlight. She wondered dully how long he had been talking,</p>
<p>what he had said. Then she was curious to hear what he was</p>
<p>saying. She was not afraid, despite his strength, his wicked</p>
<p>nature, and tho loneliness and darkness of the marsh.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a shame for a girl like you to have to do this,&quot; he was</p>
<p>saying, apparently in repetition of what he had already urged.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on an&#x27; say the word, Saxon. Come on an&#x27; say the word.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon stopped and quietly faced him.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen, Charley Long. Billy&#x27;s only doing thirty days, and his</p>
<p>time is almost up. When he gets out your life won&#x27;t be worth a</p>
<p>pinch of salt if I tell him you&#x27;ve been bothering me. Now listen.</p>
<p>If you go right now away from here, and stay away, I won&#x27;t tell</p>
<p>him. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve got to say.&quot;</p>
<p>The big blacksmith stood in scowling indecisions his face</p>
<p>pathetic in its fierce yearning, his hands making unconscious,</p>
<p>clutching contractions.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you little, small thing,&quot; he said desperately, &quot;I could</p>
<p>break you in one hand. I could--why, I could do anything I</p>
<p>wanted. I don&#x27;t want to hurt you, Saxon. You know that. Just say</p>
<p>the word--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve said the only word I&#x27;m going to say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God!&quot; he muttered in involuntary admiration. &quot;You ain&#x27;t afraid.</p>
<p>You ain&#x27;t afraid.&quot;</p>
<p>They faced each other for long silent minutes.</p>
<p>&quot;Why ain&#x27;t you afraid?&quot; he demanded at last, after peering into</p>
<p>the surrounding darkness as if searching for her hidden allies.</p>
<p>&quot;Because I married a man,&quot; Saxon said briefly. &quot;And now you&#x27;d</p>
<p>better go.&quot;</p>
<p>When he had gone she shifted the load of wood to her other</p>
<p>shoulder and started on, in her breast a quiet thrill of pride in</p>
<p>Billy. Though behind prison bars, still she leaned against his</p>
<p>strength. The mere naming of him was sufficient to drive away a</p>
<p>brute like Charley Long.</p>
<p>On the day that Otto Frank was hanged she remained indoors. The</p>
<p>evening papers published the account. There had been no reprieve.</p>
<p>In Sacramento was a railroad Governor who might reprieve or even</p>
<p>pardon bank-wreckers and grafters, but who dared not lift his</p>
<p>finger for a workingman. All this was the talk of the</p>
<p>neighborhood. It had been Billy&#x27;s talk. It had been Bert&#x27;s talk.</p>
<p>The next day Saxon started out the Rock Wall, and the specter of</p>
<p>Otto Frank walked by her side. And with him was a dimmer, mistier</p>
<p>specter that she recognized as Billy. Was he, too, destined to</p>
<p>tread his way to Otto Frank&#x27;s dark end? Surely so, if the blood</p>
<p>and strike continued. He was a fighter. He felt he was right in</p>
<p>fighting. It was easy to kill a man. Even if he did not intend</p>
<p>it, some time, when he was slugging a scab, the scab would</p>
<p>fracture his skull on a stone curbing or a cement sidewalk. And</p>
<p>then Billy would hang. That was why Otto Frank hanged. He had not</p>
<p>intended to kill Henderson. It was only by accident that</p>
<p>Henderson&#x27;s skull was fractured. Yet Otto Frank had been hanged</p>
<p>for it just the same.</p>
<p>She wrung her hands and wept loudly as she stumbled among the</p>
<p>windy rocks. The hours passed, and she was lost to herself and</p>
<p>her grief. When she came to she found herself on the far end of</p>
<p>the wall where it jutted into the bay between the Oakland and</p>
<p>Alameda Moles. But she could see no wall. It was the time of the</p>
<p>full moon, and the unusual high tide covered the rocks. She was</p>
<p>knee deep in the water, and about her knees swam scores of big</p>
<p>rock rats, squeaking and fighting, scrambling to climb upon her</p>
<p>out of the flood. She screamed with fright and horror, and kicked</p>
<p>at them. Some dived and swam away under water; others circled</p>
<p>about her warily at a distance; and one big fellow laid his teeth</p>
<p>into her shoe. Him she stepped on and crushed with her free foot.</p>
<p>By this time, though still trembling, she was able coolly to</p>
<p>consider the situation. She waded to a stout stick of driftwood a</p>
<p>few feet away, and with this quickly cleared a space about</p>
<p>herself.</p>
<p>A grinning small boy, in a small, bright-painted and half-decked</p>
<p>skiff, sailed close in to the wall and let go his sheet to spill</p>
<p>the wind. &quot;Want to get aboard?&quot; he called.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered. &quot;There are thousands of big rats here. I&#x27;m</p>
<p>afraid of them.&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded, ran close in, spilled the wind from his sail, the</p>
<p>boat&#x27;s way carrying it gently to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Shove out its bow,&quot; he commanded. &quot;That&#x27;s right. I don&#x27;t want to</p>
<p>break my centerboard.... An&#x27; then jump aboard in the</p>
<p>stern--quick!--alongside of me.&quot;</p>
<p>She obeyed, stepping in lightly beside him. He held the tiller up</p>
<p>with his elbow, pulled in on the sheet, and as the sail filled</p>
<p>the boat sprang away over the rippling water.</p>
<p>&quot;You know boats,&quot; the boy said approvingly.</p>
<p>He was a slender, almost frail lad, of twelve or thirteen years,</p>
<p>though healthy enough, with sunburned freckled face and large</p>
<p>gray eyes that were clear and wistful.</p>
<p>Despite his possession of the pretty boat, Saxon was quick to</p>
<p>sense that he was one of them, a child of the people.</p>
<p>&quot;First boat I was ever in, except ferryboats,&quot; Saxon laughed.</p>
<p>He looked at her keenly. &quot;Well, you take to it like a duck to</p>
<p>water is all I can say about it. Where d&#x27;ye want me to land you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to speak, gave her another long look,</p>
<p>considered for a space, then asked suddenly: &quot;Got plenty of</p>
<p>time?&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;All day?&quot;</p>
<p>Again she nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Say--I&#x27;ll tell you, I&#x27;m goin&#x27; out on this ebb to Goat Island for</p>
<p>rockcod, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll come in on the flood this evening. I got plenty</p>
<p>of lines an&#x27; bait. Want to come along7 We can both fish. And what</p>
<p>you catch you can have.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon hesitated. The freedom and motion of the small boat</p>
<p>appealed to her. Like the ships she had envied, it was outbound.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you&#x27;ll drown me,&quot; she parleyed.</p>
<p>The boy threw back his head with pride.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I&#x27;ve been sailin&#x27; many a long day by myself, an&#x27; I ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>drowned yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; she consented. &quot;Though remember, I don&#x27;t know</p>
<p>anything about boats.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, that&#x27;s all right.--Now I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to go about. When I say</p>
<p>&#x27;Hard a-lee!&#x27; like that, you duck your head so the boom don&#x27;t hit</p>
<p>you, an&#x27; shift over to the other side.&quot;</p>
<p>He executed the maneuver, Saxon obeyed, and found herself sitting</p>
<p>beside him on the opposite side of the boat, while the boat</p>
<p>itself, on the other tack, was heading toward Long Wharf where</p>
<p>the coal bunkers were. She was aglow with admiration, the more so</p>
<p>because the mechanics of boat-sailing was to her a complex and</p>
<p>mysterious thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you learn it all?&quot; she inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Taught myself, just naturally taught myself. I liked it, you</p>
<p>see, an&#x27; what a fellow likes he&#x27;s likeliest to do. This is my</p>
<p>second boat. My first didn&#x27;t have a centerboard. I bought it for</p>
<p>two dollars an&#x27; learned a lot, though it never stopped leaking.</p>
<p>What d &#x27;ye think I paid for this one? It&#x27;s worth twenty-five</p>
<p>dollars right now. What d &#x27;ye think I paid for it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I give up,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;How much?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Six dollars. Think of it! A boat like this! Of course I done a</p>
<p>lot of work, an&#x27; the sail cost two dollars, the oars one forty,</p>
<p>an&#x27; the paint one seventy-five. But just the same eleven dollars</p>
<p>and fifteen cents is a real bargain. It took me a long time</p>
<p>saving for it, though. I carry papers morning and</p>
<p>evening--there&#x27;s a boy taking my route for me this afternoon--I</p>
<p>give &#x27;m ten cents, an&#x27; all the extras he sells is his; and I&#x27;d</p>
<p>a-got the boat sooner only I had to pay for my shorthand lessons.</p>
<p>My mother wants me to become a court reporter. They get sometimes</p>
<p>as much as twenty dollars a day. Gee! But I don&#x27;t want it. It&#x27;s a</p>
<p>shame to waste the money on the lessons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; she asked, partly from idleness, and yet with</p>
<p>genuine curiosity; for she felt drawn to this boy in knee pants</p>
<p>who was so confident and at the same time so wistful.</p>
<p>&quot;What do I want?&quot; he repeated after her.</p>
<p>Turning his head slowly, he followed the sky-line, pausing</p>
<p>especially when his eyes rested landward on the brown Contra</p>
<p>Costa hills, and seaward, past Alcatraz, on the Golden Glate. The</p>
<p>wistfulness in his eyes was overwhelming and went to her heart.</p>
<p>&quot;That,&quot; he said, sweeping the circle of the world with a wave of</p>
<p>his arm.</p>
<p>&quot;That?&quot; she queried.</p>
<p>He looked at her, perplexed in that he had not made his meaning</p>
<p>clear.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you ever feel that way?&quot; he asked, bidding for sympathy</p>
<p>with his dream. &quot;Don&#x27;t you sometimes feel you&#x27;d die if you didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>know what&#x27;s beyond them hills an&#x27; what&#x27;s beyond the other hills</p>
<p>behind them hills? An&#x27; the Golden Gate! There&#x27;s the Pacific Ocean</p>
<p>beyond, and China, an&#x27; Japan, an&#x27; India, an&#x27;. .. an&#x27; all the</p>
<p>coral islands. You can go anywhere out through the Golden</p>
<p>Gate--to Australia, to Africa, to the seal islands, to the North</p>
<p>Pole, to Cape Horn. Why, all them places are just waitin&#x27; for me</p>
<p>to come an&#x27; see &#x27;em. I&#x27;ve lived in Oakland all my life, but I&#x27;m</p>
<p>not going to live in Oakland the rest of my life, not by a long</p>
<p>shot. I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to get away. .. away. ..&quot;</p>
<p>Again, as words failed to express the vastness of his desire, the</p>
<p>wave of his arm swept the circle of the world.</p>
<p>Saxon thrilled with him. She too, save for her earlier childhood,</p>
<p>had lived in Oakland all her life. And it had been a good place</p>
<p>in which to live. .. until now. And now, in all its nightmare</p>
<p>horror, it was a place to get away from, as with her people the</p>
<p>East had been a place to get away from. And why not? The world</p>
<p>tugged at her, and she felt in touch with the lad&#x27;s desire. Now</p>
<p>that she thought of it, her race had never been given to staying</p>
<p>long in one place. Always it had been on the move. She remembered</p>
<p>back to her mother&#x27;s tales, and to the wood engraving in her</p>
<p>scrapbook where her half-clad forebears, sword in hand, leaped</p>
<p>from their lean beaked boats to do battle on the blood-drenched</p>
<p>sands of England.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you ever hear about the Anglo-Saxons?&quot; she asked the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;You bet!&quot; His eyes glistened, and he looked at her with new</p>
<p>interest. &quot;I&#x27;m an Anglo-Saxon, every inch of me. Look at the</p>
<p>color of my eyes, my skin. I&#x27;m awful white where I ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>sunburned. An&#x27; my hair was yellow when I was a baby. My mother</p>
<p>says it&#x27;ll be dark brown by the time I&#x27;m grown up, worse luck.</p>
<p>Just the same, I&#x27;m Anglo-Saxon. I am of a fighting race. We ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>afraid of nothin&#x27;. This bay--think I&#x27;m afraid of it!&quot; He looked</p>
<p>out over the water with flashing eye of scorn. &quot;Why, I&#x27;ve crossed</p>
<p>it when it was howlin&#x27; an&#x27; when the scow schooner sailors said I</p>
<p>lied an&#x27; that I didn&#x27;t. Huh! They were only squareheads. Why, we</p>
<p>licked their kind thousands of years ago. We lick everything we</p>
<p>go up against. We&#x27;ve wandered all over the world, licking the</p>
<p>world. On the sea, on the land, it&#x27;s all the same. Look at Ivory</p>
<p>Nelson, look at Davy Crockett, look at Paul Jones, look at Clive,</p>
<p>an&#x27; Kitchener, an&#x27; Fremont, an&#x27; Kit Carson, an&#x27; all of &#x27;em.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon nodded, while he continued, her own eyes shining, and it</p>
<p>came to her what a glory it would be to be the mother of a</p>
<p>man-child like this. Her body ached with the fancied quickening</p>
<p>of unborn life. A good stock, a good stock, she thought to</p>
<p>herself. Then she thought of herself and Billy, healthy shoots of</p>
<p>that same stock, yet condemned to childlessness because of the</p>
<p>trap of the manmade world and the curse of being herded with the</p>
<p>stupid ones.</p>
<p>She came back to the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;My father was a soldier in the Civil War,&quot; he was telling her,</p>
<p>&quot;a scout an&#x27; a spy. The rebels were going to hang him twice for a</p>
<p>spy. At the battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek he ran half a mile with his</p>
<p>captain wounded on his back. He&#x27;s got a bullet in his leg right</p>
<p>now, just above the knee. It&#x27;s been there all these years. He let</p>
<p>me feel it once. He was a buffalo hunter and a trapper before the</p>
<p>war. He was sheriff of his county when he was twenty years old.</p>
<p>An&#x27; after the war, when he was marshal of Silver City, he cleaned</p>
<p>out the bad men an&#x27; gun-fighters. He&#x27;s been in almost every state</p>
<p>in the Union. He could wrestle any man at the railings in his</p>
<p>day, an&#x27; he was bully of the raftsmen of the Susquehanna when he</p>
<p>was only a youngster. His father killed a man in a standup fight</p>
<p>with a blow of his fist when he was sixty years old. An&#x27; when he</p>
<p>was seventy-four, his second wife had twins, an&#x27; he died when he</p>
<p>was plowing in the field with oxen when he was ninety-nine years</p>
<p>old. He just unyoked the oxen, an&#x27; sat down under a tree, an&#x27;</p>
<p>died there sitting up. An&#x27; my father&#x27;s just like him. He&#x27;s pretty</p>
<p>old now, but he ain&#x27;t afraid of nothing. He&#x27;s a regular</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon, you see. He&#x27;s a special policeman, an&#x27; he didn&#x27;t do</p>
<p>a thing to the strikers in some of the fightin&#x27;. He had his face</p>
<p>all cut up with a rock, but he broke his club short off over some</p>
<p>hoodlum&#x27;s head.&quot;</p>
<p>He paused breathlessly and looked at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;d hate to a-ben that hoodlum.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My name is Saxon,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Your name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My first name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!&quot; he cried. &quot;You&#x27;re lucky. Now if mine had been only</p>
<p>Erling--you know, Erling the Bold--or Wolf, or Swen, or Jarl!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Only John,&quot; he admitted sadly. &quot;But I don&#x27;t let &#x27;em call one</p>
<p>John. Everybody&#x27;s got to call me Jack. I&#x27;ve scrapped with a dozen</p>
<p>fellows that tried to call me John, or Johnnie--wouldn&#x27;t that</p>
<p>make you sick?--Johnnie!&quot;</p>
<p>They were now off the coal bunkers of Long Wharf, and the boy put</p>
<p>the skiff about, heading toward San Francisco. They were well out</p>
<p>in the open bay. The west wind had strengthened and was</p>
<p>whitecapping the strong ebb tide. The boat drove merrily along.</p>
<p>When splashes of spray flew aboard, wetting them, Saxon laughed,</p>
<p>and the boy surveyed her with approval. They passed a ferryboat,</p>
<p>and the passengers on the upper deck crowded to one side to watch</p>
<p>them. In the swell of the steamer&#x27;s wake, the skiff shipped</p>
<p>quarter-full of water. Saxon picked up an empty can and looked at</p>
<p>the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; he said. &quot;Go ahead an&#x27; bale out.&quot; And, when she</p>
<p>had finished: &quot;We&#x27;ll fetch Goat Island next tack. Right there off</p>
<p>the Torpedo Station is where we fish, in fifty feet of water an&#x27;</p>
<p>the tide runnin&#x27; to beat the band. You&#x27;re wringing wet, ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>you? Gee! You&#x27;re like your name. You&#x27;re a Saxon, all right. Are</p>
<p>you married?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;d you want to do that for, Now you can&#x27;t wander over the</p>
<p>world like I&#x27;m going to. You&#x27;re tied down. You&#x27;re anchored for</p>
<p>keeps.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s pretty good to be married, though,&quot; she smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, everybody gets married. But that&#x27;s no reason to be in a</p>
<p>rush about it. Why couldn&#x27;t you wait a while, like me, I&#x27;m goin&#x27;</p>
<p>to get married, too, but not until I&#x27;m an old man an&#x27; have been</p>
<p>everywheres.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the lee of Goat Island, Saxon obediently sitting still, he</p>
<p>took in the sail, and, when the boat had drifted to a position to</p>
<p>suit him, he dropped a tiny anchor. He got out the fish lines and</p>
<p>showed Saxon how to bait her hooks with salted minnows. Then they</p>
<p>dropped the lines to bottom, where they vibrated in the swift</p>
<p>tide, and waited for bites.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;ll bite pretty soon,&quot; he encouraged. &quot;I&#x27;ve never failed but</p>
<p>twice to catch a mess here. What d&#x27;ye say we eat while we&#x27;re</p>
<p>waiting?&quot;</p>
<p>Vainly she protested she was not hungry. He shared his lunch with</p>
<p>her with a boy&#x27;s rigid equity, even to the half of a hard-boiled</p>
<p>egg and the half of a big red apple.</p>
<p>Still the rockcod did not bite. From under the stern-sheets he</p>
<p>drew out a cloth-bound book.</p>
<p>&quot;Free Library,&quot; he vouchsafed, as he began to read, with one hand</p>
<p>holding the place while with the other he waited for the tug on</p>
<p>the fishline that would announce rockcod.</p>
<p>Saxon read the title. It was &quot;Afloat in the Forest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Listen to this,&quot; he said after a few minutes, and he read</p>
<p>several pages descriptive of a great flooded tropical forest</p>
<p>being navigated by boys on a raft.</p>
<p>&quot;Think of that!&quot; he concluded. &quot;That&#x27;s the Amazon river in flood</p>
<p>time in South America. And the world&#x27;s full of places like</p>
<p>that--everywhere, most likely, except Oakland. Oakland&#x27;s just a</p>
<p>place to start from, I guess. Now that&#x27;s adventure, I want to</p>
<p>tell you. Just think of the luck of them boys! All the same, some</p>
<p>day I&#x27;m going to go over the Andes to the headwaters of the</p>
<p>Amazon, all through the rubber country, an&#x27; canoe down the Amazon</p>
<p>thousands of miles to its mouth where it&#x27;s that wide you can&#x27;t</p>
<p>see one bank from the other an&#x27; where you can scoop up perfectly</p>
<p>fresh water out of the ocean a hundred miles from land.&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon was not listening. One pregnant sentence had caught her</p>
<p>fancy. Oakland just a place to start from. She had never viewed</p>
<p>the city in that light. She had accepted it as a place to live</p>
<p>in, as an end in itself. But a place to start from! Why not! Why</p>
<p>not like any railroad station or ferry depot! Certainly, as</p>
<p>things were going, Oakland was not a place to stop in. The boy</p>
<p>was right. It was a place to start from. But to go where? Here</p>
<p>she was halted, and she was driven from the train of thought by a</p>
<p>strong pull and a series of jerks on the line. She began to haul</p>
<p>in, hand under hand, rapidly and deftly, the boy encouraging her,</p>
<p>until hooks, sinker, and a big gasping rockcod tumbled into the</p>
<p>bottom of the boat. The fish was free of the hook, and she baited</p>
<p>afresh and dropped the line over. The boy marked his place and</p>
<p>closed the book.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;ll be biting soon as fast as we can haul &#x27;em in,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the rush of fish did not come immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you ever read Captain Mayne Reid?&quot; he asked. &quot;Or Captain</p>
<p>Marryatt? Or Ballantyne?&quot;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;And you an Anglo-Saxon!&quot; he cried derisively. &quot;Why, there&#x27;s</p>
<p>stacks of &#x27;em in the Free Library. I have two cards, my mother&#x27;s</p>
<p>an&#x27; mine, an&#x27; I draw &#x27;em out all the time, after school, before I</p>
<p>have to carry my papers. I stick the books inside my shirt, in</p>
<p>front, under the suspenders. That holds &#x27;em. One time, deliverin&#x27;</p>
<p>papers at Second an&#x27; Market--there&#x27;s an awful tough gang of kids</p>
<p>hang out there--I got into a fight with the leader. He hauled off</p>
<p>to knock my wind out, an&#x27; he landed square on a book. You ought</p>
<p>to seen his face. An&#x27; then I landed on him. An&#x27; then his whole</p>
<p>gang was goin&#x27; to jump on me, only a couple of iron-molders</p>
<p>stepped in an&#x27; saw fair play. I gave &#x27;em the books to hold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who won?&quot; Saxon asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody,&quot; the boy confessed reluctantly. &quot;I think I was lickin&#x27;</p>
<p>him, but the molders called it a draw because the policeman on</p>
<p>the beat stopped us when we&#x27;d only teen fightin&#x27; half an hour.</p>
<p>But you ought to seen the crowd. I bet there was five hundred--&quot;</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly and began hauling in his line. Saxon, too,</p>
<p>was hauling in. And in the next couple of hours they caught</p>
<p>twenty pounds of fish between them.</p>
<p>That night, long after dark, the little, half-decked skiff sailed</p>
<p>up the Oakland Estuary. The wind was fair but light, and the boat</p>
<p>moved slowly, towing a long pile which the boy had picked up</p>
<p>adrift and announced as worth three dollars anywhere for the wood</p>
<p>that was in it. The tide flooded smoothly under the full moon,</p>
<p>and Saxon recognized the points they passed--the Transit slip,</p>
<p>Sandy Beach, the shipyards, the nail works, Market street wharf.</p>
<p>The boy took the skiff in to a dilapidated boat-wharf at the foot</p>
<p>of Castro street, where the scow schooners, laden with sand and</p>
<p>gravel, lay hauled to the shore in a long row. He insisted upon</p>
<p>an equal division of the fish, because Saxon had helped catch</p>
<p>them, though he explained at length the ethics of flotsam to show</p>
<p>her that the pile was wholly his.</p>
<p>At Seventh and Poplar they separated, Saxon walking on alone to</p>
<p>Pine street with her load of fish. Tired though she was from the</p>
<p>long day, she had a strange feeling of well-being, and, after</p>
<p>cleaning the fish, she fell asleep wondering, when good times</p>
<p>came again, if she could persuade Billy to get a boat and go out</p>
<p>with her on Sundays as she had gone out that day.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>She slept all night, without stirring, without dreaming, and</p>
<p>awoke naturally and, for the first time in weeks, refreshed. She</p>
<p>felt her old self, as if some depressing weight had been lifted,</p>
<p>or a shadow had been swept away from between her and the sun. Her</p>
<p>head was clear. The seeming iron band that had pressed it so hard</p>
<p>was gone. She was cheerful. She even caught herself humming aloud</p>
<p>as she divided the fish into messes for Mrs. Olsen, Maggie</p>
<p>Donahue, and herself. She enjoyed her gossip with each of them,</p>
<p>and, returning home, plunged joyfully into the task of putting</p>
<p>the neglected house in order. She sang as she worked, and ever as</p>
<p>she sang the magic words of the boy danced and sparkled among the</p>
<p>notes: OAKLAND IS JUST A PLACE TO START FROM.</p>
<p>Everything was clear as print. Her and Billy&#x27;s problem was as</p>
<p>simple as an arithmetic problem at school: to carpet a room so</p>
<p>many feet long, so many feet wide, to paper a room so many feet</p>
<p>high, so many feet  around. She had been sick in her head, she</p>
<p>had had strange lapses, she had been irresponsible. Very well.</p>
<p>All this had been because of her troubles--troubles in which she</p>
<p>had had no hand in the making. Billy&#x27;s case was hers precisely.</p>
<p>He had behaved strangely because he had been irresponsible. And</p>
<p>all their troubles were the troubles of the trap. Oakland was the</p>
<p>trap. Oakland was a good place to start from.</p>
<p>She reviewed the events of her married life. The strikes and the</p>
<p>hard times had caused everything. If it had not been for the</p>
<p>strike of the shopmen and the fight in her front yard, she would</p>
<p>not have lost her baby. If Billy had not been made desperate by</p>
<p>the idleness and the hopeless fight of the teamsters, he would</p>
<p>not have taken to drinking. If they had not been hard up, they</p>
<p>would not have taken a lodger, and Billy would not be in jail.</p>
<p>Her mind was made up. The city was no place for her and Billy, no</p>
<p>place for love nor for babies. The way out was simple. They would</p>
<p>leave Oakland. It was the stupid that remained and bowed their</p>
<p>heads to fate. But she and Billy were not stupid. They would not</p>
<p>bow their heads. They would go forth and face fate.--Where, she</p>
<p>did not know. But that would come. The world was large. Beyond</p>
<p>the encircling hills, out through the Golden Gate, somewhere they</p>
<p>would find what they desired. The boy had been wrong in one</p>
<p>thing. She was not tied to Oakland, even if she was married. The</p>
<p>world was free to her and Billy as it had been free to the</p>
<p>wandering generations before them. It was only the stupid who had</p>
<p>been left behind everywhere in the race&#x27;s wandering. The strong</p>
<p>had gone on. Well, she and Billy were strong. They would go on,</p>
<p>over the brown Contra Costa hills or out through the Golden Gate.</p>
<p>The day before Billy&#x27;s release Saxon completed her meager</p>
<p>preparations to receive him. She was without money, and, except</p>
<p>for her resolve not to offend Billy in that way again, she would</p>
<p>have borrowed ferry fare from Maggie Donahue and journeyed to San</p>
<p>Francisco to sell some of her personal pretties. As it was, with</p>
<p>bread and potatoes and salted sardines in the house, she went out</p>
<p>at the afternoon low tide and dug clams for a chowder. Also, she</p>
<p>gathered a load of driftwood, and it was nine in the evening when</p>
<p>she emerged from the marsh, on her shoulder a bundle of wood and</p>
<p>a short-handled spade, in her free hand the pail of clams. She</p>
<p>sought the darker side of the street at the corner and hurried</p>
<p>across the zone of electric light to avoid detection by the</p>
<p>neighbors. But a woman came toward her, looked sharply and</p>
<p>stopped in front of her. It was Mary.</p>
<p>&quot;My God, Saxon!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Is it as bad as this?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon looked at her old friend curiously, with a swift glance</p>
<p>that sketched all the tragedy. Mary was thinner, though there was</p>
<p>more color in her cheeks--color of which Saxon had her doubts.</p>
<p>Mary&#x27;s bright eyes were handsomer, larger--too large, too</p>
<p>feverish bright, too restless. She was well dressed--too well</p>
<p>dressed; and she was suffering from nerves. She turned her head</p>
<p>apprehensively to glance into the darkness behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;My God!&quot; Saxon breathed. &quot;And you. ..&quot; She shut her lips, then</p>
<p>began anew. &quot;Come along to the house,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#x27;re ashamed to be seen with me--&quot; Mary blurted, with one</p>
<p>of her old quick angers.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; Saxon disclaimed. &quot;It&#x27;s the driftwood and the clams. I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t want the neighbors to know. Come along.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; I can&#x27;t, Saxon. I&#x27;d like to, but I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve got to catch</p>
<p>the next train to F&#x27;risco. I&#x27;ve ben waitin&#x27; around. I knocked at</p>
<p>your back door. But the house was dark. Billy&#x27;s still in, ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, he gets out to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I read about it in the papers,&quot; Mary went on hurriedly, looking</p>
<p>behind her. &quot;I was in Stockton when it happened.&quot; She turned upon</p>
<p>Saxon almost savagely. &quot;You don&#x27;t blame me, do you? I just</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t go back to work after bein&#x27; married. I was sick of work.</p>
<p>Played out, I guess, an&#x27; no good anyway. But if you only knew how</p>
<p>I hated the laundry even before I got married. It&#x27;s a dirty</p>
<p>world. You don&#x27;t dream. Saxon, honest to God, you could never</p>
<p>guess a hundredth part of its dirtiness. Oh, I wish I was dead, I</p>
<p>wish I was dead an&#x27; out of it all. Listen--no, I can&#x27;t now.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s the down train puffin&#x27; at Adeline. I&#x27;ll have to run for</p>
<p>it. Can I come--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, get a move on, can&#x27;t you?&quot; a man&#x27;s voice interrupted.</p>
<p>Behind her the speaker had partly emerged from the darkness. No</p>
<p>workingman, Saxon could see that--lower in the world scale,</p>
<p>despite his good clothes, than any workingman.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m comin&#x27;, if you&#x27;ll only wait a second,&quot; Mary placated.</p>
<p>And by her answer and its accents Saxon knew that Mary was afraid</p>
<p>of this man who prowled on the rim of light.</p>
<p>Mary turned to her.</p>
<p>&quot;I got to beat it; good bye,&quot; she said, fumbling in the palm of</p>
<p>her glove.</p>
<p>She caught Saxon&#x27;s free hand, and Saxon felt a small hot coin</p>
<p>pressed into it. She tried to resist, to force it back.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; Mary pleaded. &quot;For old times. You can do as much for me</p>
<p>some day. I&#x27;ll see you again. Good bye.&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, sobbing, she threw her arms around Saxon&#x27;s waist,</p>
<p>crushing the feathers of her hat against the load of wood as she</p>
<p>pressed her face against Saxon&#x27;s breast. Then she tore herself</p>
<p>away to arm&#x27;s length, passionate, queering, and stood gazing at</p>
<p>Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, get a hustle, get a hustle,&quot; came from the darkness the</p>
<p>peremptory voice of the man.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Saxon!&quot; Mary sobbed; and was gone.</p>
<p>In the house, the lamp lighted, Saxon looked at the coin. It was</p>
<p>a five-dollar piece--to her, a fortune. Then she thought of Mary,</p>
<p>and of the man of whom she was afraid. Saxon registered another</p>
<p>black mark against Oakland. Mary was one more destroyed. They</p>
<p>lived only five years, on the average, Saxon had heard somewhere.</p>
<p>She looked at the coin and tossed it into the kitchen sink. When</p>
<p>she cleaned the clams, she heard the coin tinkle down the vent</p>
<p>pipe.</p>
<p>It was the thought of Billy, next morning, that led Saxon to go</p>
<p>under the sink, unscrew the cap to the catchtrap, and rescue the</p>
<p>five-dollar piece. Prisoners were not well fed, she had been</p>
<p>told; and the thought of placing clams and dry bread before</p>
<p>Billy, after thirty days of prison fare, was too appalling for</p>
<p>her to contemplate. She knew how he liked to spread his butter on</p>
<p>thick, how he liked thick, rare steak fried on a dry hot pan, and</p>
<p>how he liked coffee that was coffee and plenty of it.</p>
<p>Not until after nine o&#x27;clock did Billy arrive, and she was</p>
<p>dressed in her prettiest house gingham to meet him. She peeped on</p>
<p>him as he came slowly up the front steps, and she would have run</p>
<p>out to him except for a group of neighborhood children who were</p>
<p>staring from across the street. The door opened before him as his</p>
<p>hand reached for the knob, and, inside, he closed it by backing</p>
<p>against it, for his arms were filled with Saxon. No, he had not</p>
<p>had breakfast, nor did he want any now that he had her. He had</p>
<p>only stopped for a shave. He had stood the barber off, and he had</p>
<p>walked all the way from the City Hall because of lack of the</p>
<p>nickel carfare. But he&#x27;d like a bath most mighty well, and a</p>
<p>change of clothes. She mustn&#x27;t come near him until he was clean.</p>
<p>When all this was accomplished, he sat in the kitchen and watched</p>
<p>her cook, noting the driftwood she put in the stove and asking</p>
<p>about it. While she moved about, she told how she had gathered</p>
<p>the wood, how she had managed to live and not be beholden to the</p>
<p>union, and by the time they were seated at the table she was</p>
<p>telling him about her meeting with Mary the night before. She did</p>
<p>not mention the five dollars.</p>
<p>Billy stopped chewing the first mouthful of steak. His expression</p>
<p>frightened her. He spat the meat out on his plate.</p>
<p>&quot;You got the money to buy the meat from her,&quot; he accused slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;You had no money, no more tick with the butcher, yet here&#x27;s</p>
<p>meat. Am I right?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon could only bend her head.</p>
<p>The terrifying, ageless look had come into his face, the bleak</p>
<p>and passionless glaze into his eyes, which she had first seen on</p>
<p>the day at Weasel Park when he had fought with the three</p>
<p>Irishmen.</p>
<p>&quot;What else did you buy?&quot; he demanded--not roughly, not angrily,</p>
<p>but with the fearful coldness of a rage that words could not</p>
<p>express.</p>
<p>To her surprise, she had grown calm. What did it matter? It was</p>
<p>merely what one must expect, living in Oakland--something to be</p>
<p>left behind when Oakland was a thing behind, a place started</p>
<p>from.</p>
<p>&quot;The coffee,&quot; she answered. &quot;And the butter.&quot;</p>
<p>He emptied his plate of meat and her plate into the frying pan,</p>
<p>likewise the roll of butter and the slice on the table, and on</p>
<p>top he poured the contents of the coffee canister. All this he</p>
<p>carried into the back yard and dumped in the garbage can. The</p>
<p>coffee pot he emptied into the sink. &quot;How much of the money you</p>
<p>got left?&quot; he next wanted to know.</p>
<p>Saxon had already gone to her purse and taken it out.</p>
<p>&quot;Three dollars and eighty cents,&quot; she counted, handing it to him.</p>
<p>&quot;I paid forty-five cents for the steak.&quot;</p>
<p>He ran his eye over the money, counted it, and went to the front</p>
<p>door. She heard the door open and close, and knew that the silver</p>
<p>had been flung into the street. When he came back to the kitchen,</p>
<p>Saxon was already serving him fried potatoes on a clean plate.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothin&#x27;s too good for the Robertses,&quot; he said; &quot;but, by God,</p>
<p>that sort of truck is too high for my stomach. It&#x27;s so high it</p>
<p>stinks.&quot;</p>
<p>He glanced at the fried potatoes, the fresh slice of dry bread,</p>
<p>and the glass of water she was placing by his plate.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right,&quot; she smiled, as he hesitated. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing</p>
<p>left that&#x27;s tainted.&quot;</p>
<p>He shot a swift glance at her face, as if for sarcasm, then</p>
<p>sighed and sat down. Almost immediately he was up again and</p>
<p>holding out his arms to her.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to eat in a minute, but I want to talk to you first,&quot;</p>
<p>he said, sitting down and holding her closely. &quot;Besides, that</p>
<p>water ain&#x27;t like coffee. Gettin&#x27; cold won&#x27;t spoil it none. Now,</p>
<p>listen. You&#x27;re the only one I got in this world. You wasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>afraid of me an&#x27; what I just done, an&#x27; I&#x27;m glad of that. Now</p>
<p>we&#x27;ll forget all about Mary. I got charity enough. I&#x27;m just as</p>
<p>sorry for her as you. I&#x27;d do anything for her. I&#x27;d wash her feet</p>
<p>for her like Christ did. I&#x27;d let her eat at my table, an&#x27; sleep</p>
<p>under my roof. But all that ain&#x27;t no reason I should touch</p>
<p>anything she&#x27;s earned. Now forget her. It&#x27;s you an&#x27; me, Saxon,</p>
<p>only you an&#x27; me an&#x27; to hell with the rest of the world. Nothing</p>
<p>else counts. You won&#x27;t never have to be afraid of me again.</p>
<p>Whisky an&#x27; I don&#x27;t mix very well, so I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to cut whisky out.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been clean off my nut, an&#x27; I ain&#x27;t treated you altogether</p>
<p>right. But that&#x27;s all past. It won&#x27;t never happen again. I&#x27;m</p>
<p>goin&#x27; to start out fresh.</p>
<p>&quot;Now take this thing. I oughtn&#x27;t to acted so hasty. But I did. I</p>
<p>oughta talked it over. But I didn&#x27;t. My damned temper got the</p>
<p>best of me, an&#x27; you know I got one. If a fellow can keep his</p>
<p>temper in boxin&#x27;, why he can keep it in bein&#x27; married, too. Only</p>
<p>this got me too sudden-like. It&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t stomach, that</p>
<p>I never could stomach. An&#x27; you wouldn&#x27;t want me to any more&#x27;n I&#x27;d</p>
<p>want you to stomach something you just couldn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>She sat up straight on his knees and looked at him, afire with an</p>
<p>idea.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean that, Billy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;ll tell you something I can&#x27;t stomach any more. I&#x27;ll die</p>
<p>if I have to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; he questioned, after a searching pause.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s up to you,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Then fire away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re letting yourself in for,&quot; she warned.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you&#x27;d better back out before it&#x27;s too late.&quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head stubbornly.</p>
<p>&quot;What you don&#x27;t want to stomach you ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to stomach. Let</p>
<p>her go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First,&quot; she commenced, &quot;no more slugging of scabs.&quot;</p>
<p>His mouth opened, but he checked the involuntary protest.</p>
<p>&quot;And, second, no more Oakland.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t get that last.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No more Oakland. No more living in Oakland. I&#x27;ll die if I have</p>
<p>to. It&#x27;s pull up stakes and get out.&quot;</p>
<p>He digested this slowly.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; he asked finally.</p>
<p>&quot;Anywhere. Everywhere. Smoke a cigarette and think it over.&quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head and studied her.</p>
<p>&quot;You mean that?&quot; he asked at length.</p>
<p>&quot;I do. I want to chuck Oakland just as hard as you wanted to</p>
<p>chuck the beefsteak, the coffee, and the butter.&quot;</p>
<p>She could see him brace himself. She could feel him brace his</p>
<p>very body ere he answered.</p>
<p>&quot;All right then, if that&#x27;s what you want. We&#x27;ll quit Oakland.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll quit it cold. God damn it, anyway, it never done nothin&#x27;</p>
<p>for me, an&#x27; I guess I&#x27;m husky enough to scratch for us both</p>
<p>anywheres. An&#x27; now that&#x27;s settled, just tell me what you got it</p>
<p>in for Oakland for.&quot;</p>
<p>And she told him all she had thought out, marshaled all the facts</p>
<p>in her indictment of Oakland, omitting nothing, not even her last</p>
<p>visit to Doctor Hentley&#x27;s office nor Billy&#x27;s drinking. He but</p>
<p>drew her closer and proclaimed his resolves anew. The time</p>
<p>passed. The fried potatoes grew cold, and the stove went out.</p>
<p>When a pause came, Billy stood up, still holding her. He glanced</p>
<p>at the fried potatoes.</p>
<p>&quot;Stone cold,&quot; he said, then turned to her. &quot;Come on. Put on your</p>
<p>prettiest. We&#x27;re goin&#x27; up town for something to eat an&#x27; to</p>
<p>celebrate. I guess we got a celebration comin&#x27;, seein&#x27; as we&#x27;re</p>
<p>going to pull up stakes an&#x27; pull our freight from the old burg.</p>
<p>An&#x27; we won&#x27;t have to walk. I can borrow a dime from the barber,</p>
<p>an&#x27; I got enough junk to hock for a blowout.&quot;</p>
<p>His junk proved to be several gold medals won in his amateur days</p>
<p>at boxing tournaments. Once up town and in the pawnshop, Uncle</p>
<p>Sam seemed thoroughly versed in the value of the medals, and</p>
<p>Billy jingled a handful of silver in his pocket as they walked</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>He was as hilarious as a boy, and she joined in his good spirits.</p>
<p>When he stopped at a corner cigar store to buy a sack of Bull</p>
<p>Durham, he changed his mind and bought Imperials.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I&#x27;m a regular devil,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Nothing&#x27;s too good</p>
<p>to-day--not even tailor-made smokes. An&#x27; no chop houses nor Jap</p>
<p>joints for you an&#x27; me. It&#x27;s Barnum&#x27;s.&quot;</p>
<p>They strolled to the restaurant at Seventh and Broadway where</p>
<p>they had had their wedding supper.</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s make believed we&#x27;re not married,&quot; Saxon suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; he agreed, &quot;--an&#x27; take a private room so as the waiter&#x27;ll</p>
<p>have to knock on the door each time he comes in.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon demurred at that.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be too expensive, Billy. You&#x27;ll have to tip him for the</p>
<p>knocking. We&#x27;ll take the regular dining room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Order anything you want,&quot; Billy said largely, when they were</p>
<p>seated. &quot;Here&#x27;s family porterhouse, a dollar an&#x27; a half. What</p>
<p>d&#x27;ye say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And hash-browned,&quot; she abetted, &quot;and coffee extra special, and</p>
<p>some oysters first--I want to compare them with the rock</p>
<p>oysters.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy nodded, and looked up from the bill of fare.</p>
<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s mussels bordelay. Try an order of them, too, an&#x27; see if</p>
<p>they beat your Rock Wall ones.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; Saxon cried, her eyes dancing. &quot;The world is ours.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re just travelers through this town.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep, that&#x27;s the stuff,&quot; Billy muttered absently. He was looking</p>
<p>at the theater column. He lifted his eyes from the paper.</p>
<p>&quot;Matinee at Bell&#x27;s. We can get reserved seats for a</p>
<p>quarter.--Doggone the luck anyway!&quot;</p>
<p>His exclamation was so aggrieved and violent that it brought</p>
<p>alarm into her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;If I&#x27;d only thought,&quot; he regretted, &quot;we could a-gone to the</p>
<p>Forum for grub. That&#x27;s the swell joint where fellows like Roy</p>
<p>Blanchard hangs out, blowin&#x27; the money we sweat for them.&quot;</p>
<p>They bought reserved tickets at Bell&#x27;s Theater; but it was too</p>
<p>early for the performance, and they went down Broadway and into</p>
<p>the Electric Theater to while away the time on a moving picture</p>
<p>show. A cowboy film was run off, and a French comic; then came a</p>
<p>rural drama situated somewhere in the Middle West. It began with</p>
<p>a farm yard scene. The sun blazed down on a corner of a barn and</p>
<p>on a rail fence where the ground lay in the mottled shade of</p>
<p>large trees overhead. There were chickens, ducks, and turkeys,</p>
<p>scratching, waddling, moving about. A big sow, followed by a</p>
<p>roly-poly litter of seven little ones, marched majestically</p>
<p>through the chickens, rooting them out of the way. The hens, in</p>
<p>turn, took it out on the little porkers, pecking them when they</p>
<p>strayed too far from their mother. And over the top rail a horse</p>
<p>looked drowsily on, ever and anon, at mathematically precise</p>
<p>intervals, switching a lazy tail that flashed high lights in the</p>
<p>sunshine.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a warm day and there are flies--can&#x27;t you just feel it?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure. An&#x27; that horse&#x27;s tail! It&#x27;s the most natural ever. Gee! I</p>
<p>bet he knows the trick of clampin&#x27; it down over the reins. I</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t wonder if his name was Iron Tail.&quot;</p>
<p>A dog ran upon the scene. The mother pig turned tail and with</p>
<p>short ludicrous jumps, followed by her progeny and pursued by the</p>
<p>dog, fled out of the film. A young girl came on, a sunbonnet</p>
<p>hanging down her back, her apron caught up in front and filled</p>
<p>with grain which she threw to the buttering fowls. Pigeons flew</p>
<p>down from the top of the film and joined in the scrambling feast.</p>
<p>The dog returned, wading scarcely noticed among the feathered</p>
<p>creatures, to wag his tail and laugh up at the girl. And, behind,</p>
<p>the horse nodded over the rail and switched on. A young man</p>
<p>entered, his errand immediately known to an audience educated in</p>
<p>moving pictures. But Saxon had no eyes for the love-making, the</p>
<p>pleading forcefulness, the shy reluctance, of man and maid. Ever</p>
<p>her gaze wandered back to the chickens, to the mottled shade</p>
<p>under the trees, to the warm wall of the barn, to the sleepy</p>
<p>horse with its ever recurrent whisk of tail</p>
<p>She drew closer to Billy, and her hand, passed around his arm,</p>
<p>sought his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Billy,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I&#x27;d just die of happiness in a place</p>
<p>like that.&quot; And, when the film was ended. &quot;We got lots of time</p>
<p>for Bell&#x27;s. Let&#x27;s stay and see that one over again.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat through a repetition of the performance, and when the</p>
<p>farm yard scene appeared, the longer Saxon looked at it the more</p>
<p>it affected her. And this time she took in further details. She</p>
<p>saw fields beyond, rolling hills in the background, and a</p>
<p>cloud-flecked sky. She identified some of the chickens,</p>
<p>especially an obstreperous old hen who resented the thrust of the</p>
<p>sow&#x27;s muzzle, particularly pecked at the little pigs, and laid</p>
<p>about her with a vengeance when the grain fell. Saxon looked back</p>
<p>across the fields to the hills and sky, breathing the</p>
<p>spaciousness of it, the freedom, the content. Tears welled into</p>
<p>her eyes and she wept silently, happily.</p>
<p>&quot;I know a trick that&#x27;d fix that old horse if he ever clamped his</p>
<p>tail down on me,&quot; Billy whispered</p>
<p>&quot;Now I know where we&#x27;re going when we leave Oakland,&quot; she</p>
<p>informed him.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked at her, and followed her gaze to the screen. &quot;Oh,&quot; he</p>
<p>said, and cogitated. &quot;An&#x27; why shouldn&#x27;t we?&quot; he added.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Billy, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>Her lips trembled in her eagerness, and her whisper broke and was</p>
<p>almost inaudible &quot;Sure,&quot; he said. It was his day of royal</p>
<p>largess.</p>
<p>&quot;What you want is yourn, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll scratch my fingers off for it.</p>
<p>An&#x27; I&#x27;ve always had a hankerin&#x27; for the country myself. Say! I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>known horses like that to sell for half the price, an&#x27; I can sure</p>
<p>cure &#x27;em of the habit.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII</p>
<p>It was early evening when they got off the car at Seventh and</p>
<p>Pine on their way home from Bell&#x27;s Theater. Billy and Saxon did</p>
<p>their little marketing together, then separated at the corner,</p>
<p>Saxon to go on to the house and prepare supper, Billy to go and</p>
<p>see the boys--the teamsters who had fought on in the strike</p>
<p>during his month of retirement.</p>
<p>&quot;Take care of yourself, Billy,&quot; she called, as he started off.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; he answered, turning his face to her over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Her heart leaped at the smile. It was his old, unsullied</p>
<p>love-smile which she wanted always to see on his face--for which,</p>
<p>armed with her own wisdom and the wisdom of Mercedes, she would</p>
<p>wage the utmost woman&#x27;s war to possess. A thought of this flashed</p>
<p>brightly through her brain, and it was with a proud little smile</p>
<p>that she remembered all her pretty equipment stored at home in</p>
<p>the bureau and the chest of drawers.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of an hour later, supper ready, all but the</p>
<p>putting on of the lamb chops at the sound of his step, Saxon</p>
<p>waited. She heard the gate click, but instead of his step she</p>
<p>heard a curious and confused scraping of many steps. She flew to</p>
<p>open the door. Billy stood there, but a different Billy from the</p>
<p>one she had parted from so short a time before. A small boy,</p>
<p>beside him, held his hat. His face had been fresh-washed, or,</p>
<p>rather, drenched, for his shirt and shoulders were wet. His pale</p>
<p>hair lay damp and plastered against his forehead, and was</p>
<p>darkened by oozing blood. Both arms hung limply by his side. But</p>
<p>his face was composed, and he even grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right,&quot; he reassured Saxon. &quot;The joke&#x27;s on me. Somewhat</p>
<p>damaged but still in the ring.&quot; He stepped gingerly across the</p>
<p>threshold. &quot;--Come on in, you fellows. We&#x27;re all mutts together.&quot;</p>
<p>He was followed in by the boy with his hat, by Bud Strothers and</p>
<p>another teamster she knew, and by two strangers. The latter were</p>
<p>big, hard-featured, sheepish-faced men, who stared at Saxon as if</p>
<p>afraid of her.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right, Saxon,&quot; Billy began, but was interrupted by Bud.</p>
<p>&quot;First thing is to get him on the bed an&#x27; cut his clothes off</p>
<p>him. Both arms is broke, and here are the ginks that done it.&quot;</p>
<p>He indicated the two strangers, who shuffled their feet with</p>
<p>embarrassment and looked more sheepish than ever.</p>
<p>Billy sat down on the bed, and while Saxon held the lamp, Bud and</p>
<p>the strangers proceeded to cut coat, shirt, and undershirt from</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>&quot;He wouldn&#x27;t go to the receivin&#x27; hospital,&quot; Bud said to Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Not on your life,&quot; Billy concurred. &quot;I had &#x27;em send for Doc</p>
<p>Hentley. He&#x27;ll be here any minute. Them two arms is all I got.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ve done pretty well by me, an&#x27; I gotta do the same by them.-</p>
<p>-No medical students a-learnin&#x27; their trade on me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how did it happens&quot; Saxon demanded, looking from Billy to</p>
<p>the two strangers, puzzled by the amity that so evidently existed</p>
<p>among them all.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, they&#x27;re all right,&quot; Billy dashed in. &quot;They done it through</p>
<p>mistake. They&#x27;re Frisco teamsters, an&#x27; they come over to help</p>
<p>us--a lot of &#x27;em.&quot;</p>
<p>The two teamsters seemed to cheer up at this, and nodded their</p>
<p>heads.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, missus,&quot; one of them rumbled hoarsely. &quot;It&#x27;s all a mistake,</p>
<p>an&#x27;... well, the joke&#x27;s on us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The drinks, anyway,&quot; Billy grinned.</p>
<p>Not only was Saxon not excited, but she was scarcely perturbed.</p>
<p>What had happened was only to be expected.</p>
<p>It was in line with all that Oakland had already done to her and</p>
<p>hers, and, besides, Billy was not dangerously hurt. Broken arms</p>
<p>and a sore head would heal. She brought chairs and seated</p>
<p>everybody.</p>
<p>&quot;Now tell me what happened,&quot; she begged. &quot;I&#x27;m all at sea, what of</p>
<p>you two burleys breaking my husband&#x27;s arms, then seeing him home</p>
<p>and holding a love-fest with him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; you got a right,&quot; Bud Strothers assured her. &quot;You see, it</p>
<p>happened this way--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shut up, Bud,&quot; Billy broke it. &quot;You didn&#x27;t see anything of</p>
<p>it.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon looked to the San Francisco teamsters.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;d come over to lend a hand, seein&#x27; as the Oakland boys was</p>
<p>gettin&#x27; some the short end of it,&quot; one spoke up, &quot;an&#x27; we&#x27;ve sure</p>
<p>learned some scabs there&#x27;s better trades than drivin&#x27; team. Well,</p>
<p>me an&#x27; Jackson here was nosin&#x27; around to see what we can see,</p>
<p>when your husband comes moseyin&#x27; along. When he--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; Jackson interrupted. &quot;get it straight as you go along.</p>
<p>We reckon we know the boys by sight. But your husband we ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>never seen around, him bein&#x27;. ..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As you might say, put away for a while,&quot; the first teamster took</p>
<p>up the tale. &quot;So, when we sees what we thinks is a scab dodgin&#x27;</p>
<p>away from us an&#x27; takin&#x27; the shortcut through the alley--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The alley back of Campbell&#x27;s grocery,&quot; Billy elucidated.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep, back of the grocery,&quot; the first teamster went on; &quot;why,</p>
<p>we&#x27;re sure he&#x27;s one of them squarehead scabs, hired through</p>
<p>Murray an&#x27; Ready, makin&#x27; a sneak to get into the stables over the</p>
<p>back fences.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We caught one there, Billy an&#x27; me,&quot; Bud interpolated.</p>
<p>&quot;So we don&#x27;t waste any time,&quot; Jackson said, addressing himself to</p>
<p>Saxon. &quot;We&#x27;ve done it before, an&#x27; we know how to do &#x27;em up brown</p>
<p>an&#x27; tie &#x27;em with baby ribbon. So we catch your husband right in</p>
<p>the alley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was lookin&#x27; for Bud,&quot; said Billy. &quot;The boys told me I&#x27;d find</p>
<p>him somewhere around the other end of the alley. An&#x27; the first</p>
<p>thing I know, Jackson, here, asks me for a match.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; right there&#x27;s where I get in my fine work,&quot; resumed the</p>
<p>first teamster.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; asked Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;That.&quot; The man pointed to the wound in Billy&#x27;s scalp. &quot;I laid &#x27;m</p>
<p>out. He went down like a steer, an&#x27; got up on his knees dippy,</p>
<p>a-gabblin&#x27; about somebody standin&#x27; on their foot. He didn&#x27;t know</p>
<p>where he was at, you see, clean groggy. An&#x27; then we done it.&quot;</p>
<p>The man paused, the tale told.</p>
<p>&quot;Broke both his arms with the crowbar,&quot; Bud supplemented.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s when I come to myself, when the bones broke,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>corroborated. &quot;An&#x27; there was the two of &#x27;em givin&#x27; me the ha-ha.</p>
<p>&#x27;That&#x27;ll last you some time,&#x27; Jackson was sayin&#x27;. An&#x27; Anson says,</p>
<p>&#x27;I&#x27;d like to see you drive horses with them arms.&#x27; An&#x27; then</p>
<p>Jackson says, &#x27;let&#x27;s give &#x27;m something for luck.&#x27; An&#x27; with that</p>
<p>he fetched me a wallop on the jaw--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; corrected Anson. &quot;That wallop was mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it sent me into dreamland over again,&quot; Billy sighed. &quot;An&#x27;</p>
<p>when I come to, here was Bud an&#x27; Anson an&#x27; Jackson dousin&#x27; me at</p>
<p>a water trough. An&#x27; then we dodged a reporter an&#x27; all come home</p>
<p>together.&quot;</p>
<p>Bud Strothers held up his fist and indicated freshly abraded</p>
<p>skin.</p>
<p>&quot;The reporter-guy just insisted on samplin&#x27; it,&quot; he said. Then,</p>
<p>to Billy: &quot;That&#x27;s why I cut around Ninth an&#x27; caught up with you</p>
<p>down on Sixth.&quot;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Doctor Hentley arrived, and drove the men</p>
<p>from the rooms. They waited till he had finished, to assure</p>
<p>themselves of Billy&#x27;s well being, and then departed. In the</p>
<p>kitchen Doctor Hentley washed his hands and gave Saxon final</p>
<p>instructions. As he dried himself he sniffed the air and looked</p>
<p>toward the stove where a pot was simmering.</p>
<p>&quot;Clams,&quot; he said. &quot;Where did you buy them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t buy them,&quot; replied Saxon. &quot;I dug them myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not in the marsh?&quot; he asked with quickened interest.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Throw them away. Throw them out. They&#x27;re death and corruption.</p>
<p>Typhoid--I&#x27;ve got three cases now, all traced to the clams and</p>
<p>the marsh.&quot;</p>
<p>When he had gone, Saxon obeyed. Still another mark against</p>
<p>Oakland, she reflected--Oakland, the man-trap, that poisoned</p>
<p>those it could not starve.</p>
<p>&quot;If it wouldn&#x27;t drive a man to drink,&quot; Billy groaned, when Saxon</p>
<p>returned to him. &quot;Did you ever dream such luck? Look at all my</p>
<p>fights in the ring, an&#x27; never a broken bone, an&#x27; here, snap,</p>
<p>snap, just like that, two arms smashed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it might be worse,&quot; Saxon smiled cheerfully.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d like to know how.&quot; It might have been your neck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; a good job. I tell you, Saxon, you gotta show me anything</p>
<p>worse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can,&quot; she said confidently.</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, wouldn&#x27;t it be worse if you intended staying on in Oakland</p>
<p>where it might happen again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can see myself becomin&#x27; a farmer an&#x27; plowin&#x27; with a pair of</p>
<p>pipe-stems like these,&quot; he persisted.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor Hentley says they&#x27;ll be stronger at the break than ever</p>
<p>before. And you know yourself that&#x27;s true of clean-broken bones.</p>
<p>Now you close your eyes and go to sleep. You&#x27;re all done up, and</p>
<p>you need to keep your brain quiet and stop thinking.&quot;</p>
<p>He closed his eyes obediently. She slipped a cool hand under the</p>
<p>nape of his neck and let it rest.</p>
<p>&quot;That feels good,&quot; he murmured. &quot;You&#x27;re so cool, Saxon. Your</p>
<p>hand, and you, all of you. Bein&#x27; with you is like comin&#x27; out into</p>
<p>the cool night after dancin&#x27; in a hot room.&quot;</p>
<p>After several minutes of quiet, he began to giggle.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, nothin&#x27;. I was just thinkin&#x27;--thinking of them mutts doin&#x27;</p>
<p>me up--me, that&#x27;s done up more scabs than I can remember.&quot;</p>
<p>Next morning Billy awoke with his blues dissipated. From the</p>
<p>kitchen Saxon heard him painfully wrestling strange vocal</p>
<p>acrobatics.</p>
<p>&quot;I got a new song you never heard,&quot; he told her when she came in</p>
<p>with a cup of coffee. &quot;I only remember the chorus though. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>the old man talkin&#x27; to some hobo of a hired man that wants to</p>
<p>marry his daughter. Mamie, that Billy Murphy used to run with</p>
<p>before he got married, used to sing it. It&#x27;s a kind of a sobby</p>
<p>song. It used to always give Mamie the weeps. Here&#x27;s the way the</p>
<p>chorus goes--an&#x27; remember, it&#x27;s the old man spielin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>And with great solemnity and excruciating Batting, Billy sang:</p>
<p>&quot;O treat my daughter kind-i-ly;</p>
<p>An&#x27; say you&#x27;ll do no harm,</p>
<p>An&#x27; when I die I&#x27;ll will to you</p>
<p>My little house an&#x27; farm--</p>
<p>My horse, my plow, my sheep, my cow,</p>
<p>An&#x27; all them little chickens in the ga-a-rden.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s them little chickens in the garden that gets me,&quot; he</p>
<p>explained. &quot;That&#x27;s how I remembered it--from the chickens in the</p>
<p>movin&#x27; pictures yesterday. An&#x27; some day we&#x27;ll have little</p>
<p>chickens in the garden, won&#x27;t we, old girl?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And a daughter, too,&quot; Saxon amplified.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I&#x27;ll be the old geezer sayin&#x27; them same words to the hired</p>
<p>man,&quot; Billy carried the fancy along. &quot;It don&#x27;t take long to raise</p>
<p>a daughter if you ain&#x27;t in a hurry.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon took her long-neglected ukulele from its case and strummed</p>
<p>it into tune.</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#x27;ve a song you never heard, Billy. Tom&#x27;s always singing it.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s crazy about taking up government land and going farming,</p>
<p>only Sarah won&#x27;t think of it. He sings it something like this:</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll have a little farm,</p>
<p>A pig, a horse, a cow,</p>
<p>And you will drive the wagon,</p>
<p>And I will drive the plow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only in this case I guess it&#x27;s me that&#x27;ll do the plowin&#x27;,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>approved. &quot;Say, Saxon, sing &#x27;Harvest Days.&#x27; That&#x27;s a farmer&#x27;s</p>
<p>song, too.&quot;</p>
<p>After that she feared the coffee was growing cold and compelled</p>
<p>Billy to take it. In the helplessness of two broken arms, he had</p>
<p>to be fed like a baby, and as she fed him they talked.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you one thing,&quot; Billy said, between mouthfuls. &quot;Once</p>
<p>we get settled down in the country you&#x27;ll have that horse you&#x27;ve</p>
<p>been wishin&#x27; for all your life. An&#x27; it&#x27;ll be all your own, to</p>
<p>ride, drive, sell, or do anything you want with.&quot;</p>
<p>And, again, he ruminated: &quot;One thing that&#x27;ll come handy in the</p>
<p>country is that I know horses; that&#x27;s a big start. I can always</p>
<p>get a job at that--if it ain&#x27;t at union wages. An&#x27; the other</p>
<p>things about farmin&#x27; I can learn fast enough.--Say, d&#x27;ye remember</p>
<p>that day you first told me about wantin&#x27; a horse to ride all your</p>
<p>life?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon remembered, and it was only by a severe struggle that she</p>
<p>was able to keep the tears from welling into her eyes. She seemed</p>
<p>bursting with happiness, and she was remembering many things--all</p>
<p>the warm promise of life with Billy that had been hers in the</p>
<p>days before hard times. And now the promise was renewed again.</p>
<p>Since its fulfillment had not come to them, they were going away</p>
<p>to fulfill it for themselves and make the moving pictures come</p>
<p>true.</p>
<p>Impelled by a half-feigned fear, she stole away into the kitchen</p>
<p>bedroom where Bert had died, to study her face in the bureau</p>
<p>mirror. No, she decided; she was little changed. She was still</p>
<p>equipped for the battlefield of love. Beautiful she was not. She</p>
<p>knew that. But had not Mercedes said that the great women of</p>
<p>history who had won men had not been beautiful? And yet, Saxon</p>
<p>insisted, as she gazed at her reflection, she was anything but</p>
<p>unlovely. She studied her wide gray eyes that were so very gray,</p>
<p>that were always alive with light and vivacities, where, in the</p>
<p>surface and depths, always swam thoughts unuttered, thoughts that</p>
<p>sank down and dissolved to give place to other thoughts. The</p>
<p>brows were excellent--she realized that. Slenderly penciled, a</p>
<p>little darker than her light brown hair, they just fitted her</p>
<p>irregular nose that was feminine but not weak, that if anything</p>
<p>was piquant and that picturesquely might be declared impudent.</p>
<p>She could see that her face was slightly thin, that the red of</p>
<p>her lips was not quite so red, and that she had lost some of her</p>
<p>quick coloring. But all that would come back again. Her mouth was</p>
<p>not of the rosebud type she saw in the magazines. She paid</p>
<p>particular attention to it. A pleasant mouth it was, a mouth to</p>
<p>be joyous with, a mouth for laughter and to make laughter in</p>
<p>others. She deliberately experimented with it, smiled till the</p>
<p>corners dented deeper. And she knew that when she smiled her</p>
<p>smile was provocative of smiles. She laughed with her eyes</p>
<p>alone--a trick of hers. She threw back her head and laughed with</p>
<p>eyes and mouth together, between her spread lips showing the even</p>
<p>rows of strong white teeth.</p>
<p>And she remembered Billy&#x27;s praise of her teeth, the night at</p>
<p>Germanic Hall after he had told Charley Long he was standing on</p>
<p>his foot. &quot;Not big, and not little dinky baby&#x27;s teeth either,&quot;</p>
<p>Billy had said, &quot;.. . just right, and they fit you.&quot; Also, he had</p>
<p>said that to look at them made him hungry, and that they were</p>
<p>good enough to eat.</p>
<p>She recollected all the compliments he had ever paid her. Beyond</p>
<p>all treasures, these were treasures to her--the love phrases,</p>
<p>praises, and admirations. He had said her skin was cool--soft as</p>
<p>velvet, too, and smooth as silk. She rolled up her sleeve to the</p>
<p>shoulder, brushed her cheek with the white skin for a test, with</p>
<p>deep scrutiny examined the fineness of its texture. And he had</p>
<p>told her that she was sweet; that he hadn&#x27;t known what it meant</p>
<p>when they said a girl was sweet, not until he had known her. And</p>
<p>he had told her that her voice was cool, that it gave him the</p>
<p>feeling her hand did when it rested on his forehead. Her voice</p>
<p>went all through him, he had said, cool and fine, like a wind of</p>
<p>coolness. And he had likened it to the first of the sea breeze</p>
<p>setting in the afternoon after a scorching hot morning. And,</p>
<p>also, when she talked low, that it was round and sweet, like the</p>
<p>&#x27;cello in the Macdonough Theater orchestra.</p>
<p>He had called her his Tonic Kid. He had called her a</p>
<p>thoroughbred, clean-cut and spirited, all fine nerves and</p>
<p>delicate and sensitive. He had liked the way she carried her</p>
<p>clothes. She carried them like a dream, had been his way of</p>
<p>putting it. They were part of her, just as much as the cool of</p>
<p>her voice and skin and the scent of her hair.</p>
<p>And her figure! She got upon a chair and tilted the mirror so</p>
<p>that she could see herself from hips to feet. She drew her skirt</p>
<p>back and up. The slender ankle was just as slender. The calf had</p>
<p>lost none of its delicately mature swell. She studied her hips,</p>
<p>her waist, her bosom, her neck, the poise of her head, and sighed</p>
<p>contentedly. Billy must be right, and he had said that she was</p>
<p>built like a French woman, and that in the matter of lines and</p>
<p>form she could give Annette Kellerman cards and spades.</p>
<p>He had said so many things, now that she recalled them all at one</p>
<p>time. Her lips! The Sunday he proposed he had said: &quot;I like to</p>
<p>watch your lips talking. It&#x27;s funny, but every move they make</p>
<p>looks like a tickly kiss.&quot; And afterward, that same day: &quot;You</p>
<p>looked good to me from the first moment I spotted you.&quot; He had</p>
<p>praised her housekeeping. He had said he fed better, lived more</p>
<p>comfortably, held up his end with the fellows, and saved money.</p>
<p>And she remembered that day when he had crushed her in his arms</p>
<p>and declared she was the greatest little bit of a woman that had</p>
<p>ever come down the pike.</p>
<p>She ran her eyes over all herself in the mirror again, gathered</p>
<p>herself together into a whole, compact and good to look</p>
<p>upon--delicious, she knew. Yes, she would do. Magnificent as</p>
<p>Billy was in his man way, in her own way she was a match for him.</p>
<p>Yes, she had done well by Billy. She deserved much--all he could</p>
<p>give her, the best he could give her. But she made no blunder of</p>
<p>egotism. Frankly valuing herself, she as frankly valued him. When</p>
<p>he was himself, his real self, not harassed by trouble, not</p>
<p>pinched by the trap, not maddened by drink, her man-boy and</p>
<p>lover, he was well worth all she gave him or could give him.</p>
<p>Saxon gave herself a farewell look. No. She was not dead, any</p>
<p>more than was Billy&#x27;s love dead, than was her love dead. All that</p>
<p>was needed was the proper soil, and their love would grow and</p>
<p>blossom. And they were turning their backs upon Oakland to go and</p>
<p>seek that proper soil.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Billy!&quot; she called through the partition, still standing on</p>
<p>the chair, one hand tipping the mirror forward and back, so that</p>
<p>she was able to run her eyes from the reflection of her ankles</p>
<p>and calves to her face, warm with color and roguishly alive.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; she heard him answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m loving myself,&quot; she called back.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the game?&quot; came his puzzled query. &quot;What are you so stuck</p>
<p>on yourself for!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you love me,&quot; she answered. &quot;I love every bit of me,</p>
<p>Billy, because. .. because. .. well, because you love every bit</p>
<p>of me.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX</p>
<p>Between feeding and caring for Billy, doing the housework, making</p>
<p>plans, and selling her store of pretty needlework, the days flew</p>
<p>happily for Saxon. Billy&#x27;s consent to sell her pretties had been</p>
<p>hard to get, but at last she succeeded in coaxing it out of him.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s only the ones I haven&#x27;t used,&quot; she urged; &quot;and I can always</p>
<p>make more when we get settled somewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>What she did not sell, along with the household linen and hers</p>
<p>and Billy&#x27;s spare clothing, she arranged to store with Tom.</p>
<p>&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Billy said. &quot;This is your picnic. What you say goes.</p>
<p>You&#x27;re Robinson Crusoe an&#x27; I&#x27;m your man Friday. Make up your mind</p>
<p>yet which way you&#x27;re goin&#x27; to travel?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Or how?&quot;</p>
<p>She held up one foot and then the other, encased in stout walking</p>
<p>shoes which she had begun that morning to break in about the</p>
<p>house. Shank&#x27;s mare, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the way our people came into the West,&quot; she said proudly.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;ll be regular trampin&#x27;, though,&quot; he argued. &quot;An&#x27; I never</p>
<p>heard of a woman tramp.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then here&#x27;s one. Why, Billy, there&#x27;s no shame in tramping. My</p>
<p>mother tramped most of the way across the Plains. And &#x27;most</p>
<p>everybody else&#x27;s mother tramped across in those days. I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>care what people will think. I guess our race has been on the</p>
<p>tramp since the beginning of creation, just like we&#x27;ll be,</p>
<p>looking for a piece of land that looked good to settle down on.&quot;</p>
<p>After a few days, when his scalp was sufficiently healed and the</p>
<p>bone-knitting was nicely in process, Billy was able to be up and</p>
<p>about. He was still quite helpless, however, with both his arms</p>
<p>in splints.</p>
<p>Doctor Hentley not only agreed, but himself suggested, that his</p>
<p>bill should wait against better times for settlement. Of</p>
<p>government land, in response to Saxon&#x27;s eager questioning, he</p>
<p>knew nothing, except that he had a hazy idea that the days of</p>
<p>government land were over.</p>
<p>Tom, on the contrary, was confident that there was plenty of</p>
<p>government hand. He talked of Honey Lake, of Shasta County, and</p>
<p>of Humboldt.</p>
<p>&quot;But you can&#x27;t tackle it at this time of year, with winter comin&#x27;</p>
<p>on,&quot; he advised Saxon. &quot;The thing for you to do is head south for</p>
<p>warmer weather--say along the coast. It don&#x27;t snow down there. I</p>
<p>tell you what you do. Go down by San Jose and Salinas an&#x27; come</p>
<p>out on the coast at Monterey. South of that you&#x27;ll find</p>
<p>government land mixed up with forest reserves and Mexican</p>
<p>rancheros. It&#x27;s pretty wild, without any roads to speak of. All</p>
<p>they do is handle cattle. But there&#x27;s some fine redwood canyons,</p>
<p>with good patches of farming ground that run right down to the</p>
<p>ocean. I was talkin&#x27; last year with a fellow that&#x27;s been all</p>
<p>through there. An&#x27; I&#x27;d a-gone, like you an&#x27; Billy, only Sarah</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t hear of it. There&#x27;s gold down there, too. Quite a bunch</p>
<p>is in there prospectin&#x27;, an&#x27; two or three good mines have opened.</p>
<p>But that&#x27;s farther along and in a ways from the coast. You might</p>
<p>take a look.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shook her head. &quot;We&#x27;re not looking for gold but for</p>
<p>chickens and a place to grow vegetables. Our folks had all the</p>
<p>chance for gold in the early days, and what have they got to show</p>
<p>for it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you&#x27;re right,&quot; Tom conceded. &quot;They always played too big</p>
<p>a game, an&#x27; missed the thousand little chances right under their</p>
<p>nose. Look at your pa. I&#x27;ve heard him tell of selling three</p>
<p>Market street lots in San Francisco for fifty dollars each.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re worth five  hundred thousand right now. An&#x27; look at Uncle</p>
<p>Will. He had ranches till the cows come home. Satisfied? No. He</p>
<p>wanted to be a cattle king, a regular Miller and Lux. An&#x27; when he</p>
<p>died he was a night watchman in Los Angeles at forty dollars a</p>
<p>month. There&#x27;s a spirit of the times, an&#x27; the spirit of the times</p>
<p>has changed. It&#x27;s all big business now, an&#x27; we&#x27;re the small</p>
<p>potatoes. Why, I&#x27;ve heard our folks talk of livin&#x27; in the Western</p>
<p>Reserve. That was all around what&#x27;s Ohio now. Anybody could get a</p>
<p>farm them days. All they had to do was yoke their oxen an&#x27; go</p>
<p>after it, an&#x27; the Pacific Ocean thousands of miles to the west,</p>
<p>an&#x27; all them thousands of miles an&#x27; millions of farms just</p>
<p>waitin&#x27; to be took up. A hundred an&#x27; sixty acres? Shucks. In the</p>
<p>early days in Oregon they talked six hundred an&#x27; forty acres.</p>
<p>That was the spirit of them times--free land, an&#x27; plenty of it.</p>
<p>But when we reached the Pacific Ocean them times was ended. Big</p>
<p>business begun; an&#x27; big business means big business men; an&#x27;</p>
<p>every big business man means thousands of little men without any</p>
<p>business at all except to work for the big ones. They&#x27;re the</p>
<p>losers, don&#x27;t you see? An&#x27; if they don&#x27;t like it they can lump</p>
<p>it, but it won&#x27;t do them no good. They can&#x27;t yoke up their oxen</p>
<p>an&#x27; pull on. There&#x27;s no place to pull on. China&#x27;s over there, an&#x27;</p>
<p>in between&#x27;s a mighty lot of salt water that&#x27;s no good for</p>
<p>farmin&#x27; purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s all clear enough,&quot; Saxon commented.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; her brother went on. &quot;We can all see it after it&#x27;s</p>
<p>happened, when it&#x27;s too late.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the big men were smarter,&quot; Saxon remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;They were luckier,&quot; Tom contended. &quot;Some won, but most lost, an&#x27;</p>
<p>just as good men lost. It was almost like a lot of boys</p>
<p>scramblin&#x27; on the sidewalk for a handful of small change. Not</p>
<p>that some didn&#x27;t have far-seein&#x27;. But just take your pa, for</p>
<p>example. He come of good Down East stock that&#x27;s got business</p>
<p>instinct an&#x27; can add to what it&#x27;s got. Now suppose your pa had</p>
<p>developed a weak heart, or got kidney disease, or caught</p>
<p>rheumatism, so he couldn&#x27;t go gallivantin&#x27; an&#x27; rainbow chasin&#x27;,</p>
<p>an&#x27; fightin&#x27; an&#x27; explorin&#x27; all over the West. Why, most likely</p>
<p>he&#x27;d a settled down in San Francisco--he&#x27;d a-had to--an&#x27; held</p>
<p>onto them three Market street lots, an&#x27; bought more lots, of</p>
<p>course, an&#x27; gone into steamboat companies, an&#x27; stock gamblin&#x27;,</p>
<p>an&#x27; railroad buildin&#x27;, an&#x27; Comstock-tunnelin&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, he&#x27;d a-become big business himself. I know &#x27;m. He was the</p>
<p>most energetic man I ever saw, think quick as a wink, as cool as</p>
<p>an icicle an&#x27; as wild as a Comanche. Why, he&#x27;d a-cut a swath</p>
<p>through the free an&#x27; easy big business gamblers an&#x27; pirates of</p>
<p>them days; just as he cut a swath through the hearts of the</p>
<p>ladies when he went gallopin&#x27; past on that big horse of his,</p>
<p>sword clatterin&#x27;, spurs jinglin&#x27;, his long hair fiyin&#x27;, straight</p>
<p>as an Indian, clean-built an&#x27; graceful as a blue-eyed prince out</p>
<p>of a fairy book an&#x27; a Mexican caballero all rolled into one; just</p>
<p>as he cut a swath through the Johnny Rebs in Civil War days,</p>
<p>chargin&#x27; with his men all the way through an&#x27; back again, an&#x27;</p>
<p>yellin&#x27; like a wild Indian for more. Cady, that helped raise you,</p>
<p>told me about that. Cady rode with your pa.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, if your pa&#x27;d only got laid up in San Francisco, he would</p>
<p>a-ben one of the big men of the West. An&#x27; in that case, right</p>
<p>now, you&#x27;d be a rich young woman, travelin&#x27; in Europe, with a</p>
<p>mansion on Nob Hill along with the Floods and Crockers, an&#x27;</p>
<p>holdin&#x27; majority stock most likely in the Fairmount Hotel an&#x27; a</p>
<p>few little concerns like it. An&#x27; why ain&#x27;t you? Because your pa</p>
<p>wasn&#x27;t smart? No. His mind was like a steel trap. It&#x27;s because he</p>
<p>was filled to burstin&#x27; an&#x27; spillin&#x27; over with the spirit of the</p>
<p>times; because he was full of fire an&#x27; vinegar an&#x27; couldn&#x27;t set</p>
<p>down in one place. That&#x27;s all the difference between you an&#x27; the</p>
<p>young women right now in the Flood and Crocker families. Your</p>
<p>father didn&#x27;t catch rheumatism at the right time, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon sighed, then smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same, I&#x27;ve got them beaten,&quot; she said. &quot;The Miss Floods</p>
<p>and Miss Crockers can&#x27;t marry prize-fighters, and I did.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom looked at her, taken aback for the moment, with admiration,</p>
<p>slowly at first, growing in his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, all I got to say,&quot; he enunciated solemnly, &quot;is that</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s so lucky he don&#x27;t know how lucky he is.&quot;</p>
<p>Not until Doctor Hentley gave the word did the splints come off</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s arms, and Saxon insisted upon an additional two weeks&#x27;</p>
<p>delay so that no risk would be run. These two weeks would</p>
<p>complete another month&#x27;s rent, and the landlord had agreed to</p>
<p>wait payment for the last two months until Billy was on his feet</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Salinger&#x27;s awaited the day set by Saxon for taking back their</p>
<p>furniture. Also, they had returned to Billy seventy-five dollars.</p>
<p>&quot;The rest you&#x27;ve paid will be rent,&quot; the collector told Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;And the furniture&#x27;s second hand now, too. The deal will be a</p>
<p>loss to Salinger&#x27;s&#x27; and they didn&#x27;t have to do it, either; you</p>
<p>know that. So just remember they&#x27;ve been pretty square with you,</p>
<p>and if you start over again don&#x27;t forget them.&quot;</p>
<p>Out of this sum, and out of what was realized from Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>pretties, they were able to pay all their small bills and yet</p>
<p>have a few dollars remaining in pocket.</p>
<p>&quot;I hate owin&#x27; things worse &#x27;n poison,&quot; Billy said to Saxon. &quot;An&#x27;</p>
<p>now we don&#x27;t owe a soul in this world except the landlord an&#x27; Doc</p>
<p>Hentley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And neither of them can afford to wait longer than they have</p>
<p>to,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;And they won&#x27;t,&quot; Billy answered quietly.</p>
<p>She smiled her approval, for she shared with Billy his horror of</p>
<p>debt, just as both shared it with that early tide of pioneers</p>
<p>with a Puritan ethic, which had settled the West.</p>
<p>Saxon timed her opportunity when Billy was out of the house to</p>
<p>pack the chest of drawers which had crossed the Atlantic by</p>
<p>sailing ship and the Plains by ox team. She kissed the bullet</p>
<p>hole in it, made in the fight at Little Meadow, as she kissed her</p>
<p>father&#x27;s sword, the while she visioned him, as she always did,</p>
<p>astride his roan warhorse. With the old religious awe, she pored</p>
<p>over her mother&#x27;s poems in the scrap-book, and clasped her</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s red satin Spanish girdle about her in a farewell</p>
<p>embrace. She unpacked the scrap-book in order to gaze a last time</p>
<p>at the wood engraving of the Vikings, sword in hand, leaping upon</p>
<p>the English sands. Again she identified Billy as one of the</p>
<p>Vikings, and pondered for a space on the strange wanderings of</p>
<p>the seed from which she sprang. Always had her race been</p>
<p>land-hungry, and she took delight in believing she had bred true;</p>
<p>for had not she, despite her life passed in a city, found this</p>
<p>same land-hunger in her? And was she not going forth to satisfy</p>
<p>that hunger, just as her people of old time had done, as her</p>
<p>father and mother before her? She remembered her mother&#x27;s tale of</p>
<p>how the promised land looked to them as their battered wagons and</p>
<p>weary oxen dropped down through the early winter snows of the</p>
<p>Sierras to the vast and flowering sun-land of California: In</p>
<p>fancy, herself a child of nine, she looked down from the snowy</p>
<p>heights as her mother must have looked down. She recalled and</p>
<p>repeated aloud one of her mother&#x27;s stanzas:</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Sweet as a wind-lute&#x27;s airy strains</p>
<p>Your gentle muse has learned to sing</p>
<p>And California&#x27;s boundless plains</p>
<p>Prolong the soft notes echoing.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>She sighed happily and dried her eyes. Perhaps the hard times</p>
<p>were past. Perhaps they had constituted HER Plains, and she and</p>
<p>Billy had won safely across and were even then climbing the</p>
<p>Sierras ere they dropped down into the pleasant valley land.</p>
<p>Salinger&#x27;s wagon was at the house, taking out the furniture, the</p>
<p>morning they left. The landlord, standing at the gate, received</p>
<p>the keys, shook hands with them, and wished them luck. &quot;You&#x27;re</p>
<p>goin&#x27; at it right,&quot; he congratulated them. &quot;Sure an&#x27; wasn&#x27;t it</p>
<p>under me roll of blankets I tramped into Oakland meself forty</p>
<p>year ago! Buy land, like me, when it&#x27;s cheap. It&#x27;ll keep you from</p>
<p>the poorhouse in your old age. There&#x27;s plenty of new towns</p>
<p>springin&#x27; up. Get in on the ground floor. The work of your</p>
<p>hands&#x27;ll keep you in food an&#x27; under a roof, an&#x27; the lend &#x27;ll make</p>
<p>you well to do. An&#x27; you know me address. When you can spare send</p>
<p>me along that small bit of rent. An&#x27; good luck. An&#x27; don&#x27;t mind</p>
<p>what people think. &#x27;Tis them that looks that finds.&quot;</p>
<p>Curious neighbors peeped from behind the blinds as Billy and</p>
<p>Saxon strode up the street, while the children gazed at them in</p>
<p>gaping astonishment. On Billy&#x27;s back, inside a painted canvas</p>
<p>tarpaulin, was slung the roll of bedding. Inside the roll were</p>
<p>changes of underclothing and odds and ends of necessaries.</p>
<p>Outside, from the lashings, depended a frying pan and cooking</p>
<p>pail. In his hand he carried the coffee pot. Saxon carried a</p>
<p>small telescope basket protected by black oilcloth, and across</p>
<p>her back was the tiny ukulele case.</p>
<p>&quot;We must look like holy frights,&quot; Billy grumbled, shrinking from</p>
<p>every gaze that was bent upon him.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;d be all right, if we were going camping,&quot; Saxon consoled.</p>
<p>&quot;Only we&#x27;re not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But they don&#x27;t know that,&quot; she continued. &quot;It&#x27;s only you know</p>
<p>that, and what you think they&#x27;re thinking isn&#x27;t what they&#x27;re</p>
<p>thinking at all. Most probably they think we&#x27;re going camping.</p>
<p>And the best of it is we are going camping. We are! We are!&quot;</p>
<p>At this Billy cheered up, though he muttered his firm intention</p>
<p>to knock the block off of any guy that got fresh. He stole a</p>
<p>glance at Saxon. Her cheeks were red, her eyes glowing.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said suddenly. &quot;I seen an opera once, where fellows</p>
<p>wandered over the country with guitars slung on their backs just</p>
<p>like you with that strummy-strum. You made me think of them. They</p>
<p>was always singin&#x27; songs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s what I brought it along for,&quot; Saxon answered.</p>
<p>&quot;And when we go down country roads we&#x27;ll sing as we go along, and</p>
<p>we&#x27;ll sing by the campfires, too. We&#x27;re going camping, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>all. Taking a vacation and seeing the country. So why shouldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>we have a good time? Why, we don&#x27;t even know where we&#x27;re going to</p>
<p>sleep to-night, or any night. Think of the fun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a sporting proposition all right, all right,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>considered. &quot;But, just the same, let&#x27;s turn off an&#x27; go around the</p>
<p>block. There&#x27;s some fellows I know, standin&#x27; up there on the next</p>
<p>corner, an&#x27; I don&#x27;t want to knock THEIR blocks off.&quot;</p>
<p>BOOK III</p>
<p>CHAPTER I</p>
<p>The car ran as far as Hayward&#x27;s, but at Saxon&#x27;s suggestion they</p>
<p>got off at San Leandro.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter where we start walking,&quot; she said, &quot;for start</p>
<p>to walk somewhere we must. And as we&#x27;re looking for land and</p>
<p>finding out about land, the quicker we begin to investigate the</p>
<p>better. Besides, we want to know all about all kinds of land,</p>
<p>close to the big cities as well as back in the mountains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!--this must be the Porchugeeze headquarters,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>reiterated comment, as they walked through San Leandro.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as though they&#x27;d crowd our kind out,&quot; Saxon adjudged.</p>
<p>&quot;Some tall crowdin&#x27;, I guess,&quot; Billy grumbled. &quot;It looks like the</p>
<p>free-born American ain&#x27;t got no room left in his own land.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then it&#x27;s his own fault,&quot; Saxon said, with vague asperity,</p>
<p>resenting conditions she was just beginning to grasp.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know about that. I reckon the American could do what</p>
<p>the Porchugeeze do if he wanted to. Only he don&#x27;t want to, thank</p>
<p>God. He ain&#x27;t much given to livin&#x27; like a pig often leavin&#x27;s.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not in the country, maybe,&quot; Saxon controverted. &quot;But I&#x27;ve seen</p>
<p>an awful lot of Americans living like pigs in the cities.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy grunted unwilling assent. &quot;I guess they quit the farms an&#x27;</p>
<p>go to the city for something better, an&#x27; get it in the neck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look at all the children!&quot; Saxon cried. &quot;School&#x27;s letting out.</p>
<p>And nearly all are Portuguese, Billy, NOT Porchugeeze. Mercedes</p>
<p>taught me the right way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They never wore glad rags like them in the old country,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>sneered. &quot;They had to come over here to get decent clothes and</p>
<p>decent grub. They&#x27;re as fat as butterballs.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon nodded affirmation, and a great light seemed suddenly to</p>
<p>kindle in her understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the very point, Billy. They&#x27;re doing it--doing it</p>
<p>farming, too. Strikes don&#x27;t bother THEM.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t call that dinky gardening farming,&quot; he objected,</p>
<p>pointing to a piece of land barely the size of an acre, which</p>
<p>they were passing.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, your ideas are still big,&quot; she laughed. &quot;You&#x27;re like Uncle</p>
<p>Will, who owned thousands of acres and wanted to own a million,</p>
<p>and who wound up as night watchman. That&#x27;s what was the trouble</p>
<p>with all us Americans. Everything large scale. Anything less than</p>
<p>one hundred and sixty acres was small scale.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same,&quot; Billy held stubbornly, &quot;large scale&#x27;s a whole</p>
<p>lot better&#x27;n small scale like all these dinky gardens.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon sighed. &quot;I don&#x27;t know which is the dinkier,&quot; she observed</p>
<p>finally, &quot;--owning a few little acres and the team you&#x27;re</p>
<p>driving, or not owning any acres and driving a team somebody else</p>
<p>owns for wages.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy winced.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on, Robinson Crusoe,&quot; he growled good naturedly. &quot;Rub it in</p>
<p>good an&#x27; plenty. An&#x27; the worst of it is it&#x27;s correct. A hell of a</p>
<p>free-born American I&#x27;ve been, adrivin&#x27; other folkses&#x27; teams for a</p>
<p>livin&#x27;, a-strikin&#x27; and a-sluggin&#x27; scabs, an&#x27; not bein&#x27; able to</p>
<p>keep up with the installments for a few sticks of furniture. Just</p>
<p>the same I was sorry for one thing. I hated worse in Sam Hill to</p>
<p>see that Morris chair go back--you liked it so. We did a lot of</p>
<p>honeymoonin&#x27; in that chair.&quot;</p>
<p>They were well out of San Leandro, walking through a region of</p>
<p>tiny holdings--&quot;farmlets,&quot; Billy called them; and Saxon got out</p>
<p>her ukulele to cheer him with a song.</p>
<p>First, it was &quot;Treat my daughter kind-i-ly,&quot; and then she swung</p>
<p>into old-fashioned darky camp-meeting hymns, beginning with:</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! de Judgmen&#x27; Day am rollin&#x27; roan&#x27;,</p>
<p>Rollin&#x27;, yes, a-rollin&#x27;,</p>
<p>I hear the trumpets&#x27; awful soun&#x27;,</p>
<p>Rollin&#x27;, yes, a-rollin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>A big touring car, dashing past, threw a dusty pause in her</p>
<p>singing, and Saxon delivered herself of her latest wisdom.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Billy, remember we&#x27;re not going to take up with the first</p>
<p>piece of land we see. We&#x27;ve got to go into this with our eyes</p>
<p>open--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; they ain&#x27;t open yet,&quot; he agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;And we&#x27;ve got to get them open. &#x27;&#x27;Tis them that looks that</p>
<p>finds.&#x27; There&#x27;s lots of time to learn things. We don&#x27;t care if it</p>
<p>takes months and months. We&#x27;re footloose. A good start is better</p>
<p>than a dozen bad ones. We&#x27;ve got to talk and find out. We&#x27;ll talk</p>
<p>with everybody we meet. Ask questions. Ask everybody. It&#x27;s the</p>
<p>only way to find out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I ain&#x27;t much of a hand at askin&#x27; questions,&quot; Billy demurred.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;ll ask,&quot; she cried. &quot;We&#x27;ve got to win out at this game,</p>
<p>and the way is to know. Look at all these Portuguese. Where are</p>
<p>all the Americans? They owned the land first, after the Mexicans.</p>
<p>What made the Americans clear out? How do the Portuguese make it</p>
<p>go? Don&#x27;t you see, We&#x27;ve got to ask millions of questions.&quot;</p>
<p>She strummed a few chords, and then her clear sweet voice rang</p>
<p>out gaily:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;s g&#x27;wine back to Dixie,</p>
<p>I&#x27;s g&#x27;wine back to Dixie,</p>
<p>I&#x27;s g&#x27;wine where de orange blossoms grow,</p>
<p>For I hear de chillun eallin&#x27;,</p>
<p>I see de sad tears fallin&#x27;--</p>
<p>My heart&#x27;s turned back to Dixie,</p>
<p>An&#x27; I mus&#x27;go.&quot;</p>
<p>She broke off to exclaim: &quot;Oh! What a lovely place! See that</p>
<p>arbor--just covered with grapes!&quot;</p>
<p>Again and again she was attracted by the small places they</p>
<p>passed. Now it was: &quot;Look at the flowers!&quot; or: &quot;My! those</p>
<p>vegetables!&quot; or: &quot;See! They&#x27;ve got a cow!&quot;</p>
<p>Men--Americans--driving along in buggies or runabouts looked at</p>
<p>Saxon and Billy curiously. This Saxon could brook far easier than</p>
<p>could Billy, who would mutter and grumble deep in his throat.</p>
<p>Beside the road they came upon a lineman eating his lunch.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop and talk,&quot; Saxon whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, what&#x27;s the good? He&#x27;s a lineman. What&#x27;d he know about</p>
<p>farmin&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You never can tell. He&#x27;s our kind. Go ahead, Billy. You just</p>
<p>speak to him. He isn&#x27;t working now anyway, and he&#x27;ll be more</p>
<p>likely to talk. See that tree in there, just inside the gate, and</p>
<p>the way the branches are grown together. It&#x27;s a curiosity. Ask</p>
<p>him about it. That&#x27;s a good way to get started.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy stopped, when they were alongside.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do,&quot; he said gruffly.</p>
<p>The lineman, a young fellow, paused in the cracking of a</p>
<p>hard-boiled egg to stare up at the couple.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Billy swung his pack from his shoulders to the ground, and Saxon</p>
<p>rested her telescope basket.</p>
<p>&quot;Peddlin&#x27;?&quot; the young man asked, too discreet to put his question</p>
<p>directly to Saxon, yet dividing it between her and Billy, and</p>
<p>cocking his eye at the covered basket.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she spoke up quickly. &quot;We&#x27;re looking for land. Do you know</p>
<p>of any around here?&quot;</p>
<p>Again he desisted from the egg, studying them with sharp eyes as</p>
<p>if to fathom their financial status.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know what land sells for around here?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Saxon answered. &quot;Do you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess I ought to. I was born here. And land like this all</p>
<p>around you runs at from two to three hundred to four an&#x27; five</p>
<p>hundred dollars an acre.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whew!&quot; Billy whistled. &quot;I guess we don&#x27;t want none of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what makes it that high? Town lots?&quot; Saxon wanted to know.</p>
<p>&quot;Nope. The Porchugeeze make it that high, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it was pretty good land that fetched a hundred an</p>
<p>acre,&quot; Billy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, them times is past. They used to give away land once, an&#x27; if</p>
<p>you was good, throw in all the cattle runnin&#x27; on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about government land around here?&quot; was Billy&#x27;a next query.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t none, an&#x27; never was. This was old Mexican grants. My</p>
<p>grandfather bought sixteen hundred of the best acres around here</p>
<p>for fifteen hundred dollars--five hundred down an&#x27; the balance in</p>
<p>five years without interest. But that was in the early days. He</p>
<p>come West in &#x27;48, tryin&#x27; to find a country without chills an&#x27;</p>
<p>fever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He found it all right,&quot; said Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;You bet he did. An&#x27; if him an&#x27; father &#x27;d held onto the land it&#x27;d</p>
<p>been better than a gold mine, an&#x27; I wouldn&#x27;t be workin&#x27; for a</p>
<p>livin&#x27;. What&#x27;s your business?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Teamster.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ben in the strike in Oakland?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing. I&#x27;ve teamed there most of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>Here the two men wandered off into a discussion of union affairs</p>
<p>and the strike situation; but Saxon refused to be balked, and</p>
<p>brought back the talk to the land.</p>
<p>&quot;How was it the Portuguese ran up the price of lend?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>The young fellow broke away from union matters with an effort,</p>
<p>and for a moment regarded her with lack luster eyes, until the</p>
<p>question sank into his consciousness.</p>
<p>&quot;Because they worked the land overtime. Because they worked</p>
<p>mornin&#x27;, noon, an&#x27; night, all hands, women an&#x27; kids. Because they</p>
<p>could get more out of twenty acres than we could out of a hundred</p>
<p>an&#x27; sixty. Look at old Silva--Antonio Silva. I&#x27;ve known him ever</p>
<p>since I was a shaver. He didn&#x27;t have the price of a square meal</p>
<p>when he hit this section and begun leasin&#x27; land from my folks.</p>
<p>Look at him now--worth two hundred an&#x27; fifty thousan&#x27; cold, an&#x27; I</p>
<p>bet he&#x27;s got credit for a million, an&#x27; there&#x27;s no tellin&#x27; what</p>
<p>the rest of his family owns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And he made all that out of your folks&#x27; land?&quot; Saxon demanded.</p>
<p>The young man nodded his head with evident reluctance.</p>
<p>&quot;Then why didn&#x27;t your folks do it?&quot; she pursued.</p>
<p>The lineman shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Search me,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But the money was in the land,&quot; she persisted.</p>
<p>&quot;Blamed if it was,&quot; came the retort, tinged slightly with color.</p>
<p>&quot;We never saw it stickin&#x27; out so as you could notice it. The</p>
<p>money was in the hands of the Porchugeeze, I guess. They knew a</p>
<p>few more &#x27;n we did, that&#x27;s all.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon showed such dissatisfaction with his explanation that he</p>
<p>was stung to action. He got up wrathfully. &quot;Come on, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>show you,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ll show you why I&#x27;m workin&#x27; for wages when</p>
<p>I might a-ben a millionaire if my folks hadn&#x27;t been mutts. That&#x27;s</p>
<p>what we old Americans are, Mutts, with a capital M.&quot;</p>
<p>He led them inside the gate, to the fruit tree that had first</p>
<p>attracted Saxon&#x27;s attention. From the main crotch diverged the</p>
<p>four main branches of the tree. Two feet above the crotch the</p>
<p>branches were connected, each to the ones on both sides, by</p>
<p>braces of living wood.</p>
<p>&quot;You think it growed that way, eh? Well, it did. But it was old</p>
<p>Silva that made it just the same--caught two sprouts, when the</p>
<p>tree was young, an&#x27; twisted &#x27;em together. Pretty slick, eh? You</p>
<p>bet. That tree&#x27;ll never blow down. It&#x27;s a natural, springy brace,</p>
<p>an&#x27; beats iron braces stiff. Look along all the rows. Every</p>
<p>tree&#x27;s that way. See? An&#x27; that&#x27;s just one trick of the</p>
<p>Porchugeeze. They got a million like it.</p>
<p>&quot;Figure it out for yourself. They don&#x27;t need props when the</p>
<p>crop&#x27;s heavy. Why, when we had a heavy crop, we used to use five</p>
<p>props to a tree. Now take ten acres of trees. That&#x27;d be some</p>
<p>several thousan&#x27; props. Which cost money, an&#x27; labor to put in an&#x27;</p>
<p>take out every year. These here natural braces don&#x27;t have to have</p>
<p>a thing done. They&#x27;re Johnny-on-the-spot all the time. Why, the</p>
<p>Porchugeeze has got us skinned a mile. Come on, I&#x27;ll show you.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy, with city notions of trespass, betrayed perturbation at</p>
<p>the freedom they were making of the little farm.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s all right, as long as you don&#x27;t step on nothin&#x27;,&quot; the</p>
<p>lineman reassured him. &quot;Besides, my grandfather used to own this.</p>
<p>They know me. Forty years ago old Silva come from the Azores.</p>
<p>Went sheep-herdin&#x27; in the mountains for a couple of years, then</p>
<p>blew in to San Leandro. These five acres was the first land he</p>
<p>leased. That was the beginnin&#x27;. Then he began leasin&#x27; by the,</p>
<p>hundreds of acres, an&#x27; by the hundred-an&#x27;-sixties. An&#x27; his</p>
<p>sisters an&#x27; his uncles an&#x27; his aunts begun pourin&#x27; in from the</p>
<p>Azores--they&#x27;re all related there, you know; an&#x27; pretty soon San</p>
<p>Leandro was a regular Porchugeeze settlement.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; old Silva wound up by buyin&#x27; these five acres from</p>
<p>grandfather. Pretty soon--an&#x27; father by that time was in the hole</p>
<p>to the neck--he was buyin&#x27; father&#x27;s land by the</p>
<p>hundred-an&#x27;-sixties. An&#x27; all the rest of his relations was coin&#x27;</p>
<p>the same thing. Eather was always gettin&#x27; rich quick, an&#x27; he</p>
<p>wound up by dyin&#x27; in debt. But old Silva never overlooked a bet,</p>
<p>no matter how dinky. An&#x27; all the rest are just like him. You see</p>
<p>outside the fence there, clear to the wheel-tracks in the</p>
<p>road--horse-beans. We&#x27;d a-scorned to do a picayune thing like</p>
<p>that. Not Silva. Why he&#x27;s got a town house in San Leandro now.</p>
<p>An&#x27; he rides around in a four-thousan&#x27;-dollar tourin&#x27; car. An&#x27;</p>
<p>just the same his front door yard grows onions clear to the</p>
<p>sidewalk. He clears three hundred a year on that patch alone. I</p>
<p>know ten acres of land he bought last year,--a thousan&#x27; an acre</p>
<p>they asked&#x27;m, an&#x27; he never batted an eye. He knew it was worth</p>
<p>it, that&#x27;s all. He knew he could make it pay. Back in the hills,</p>
<p>there, he&#x27;s got a ranch of five hundred an&#x27; eighty acres, bought</p>
<p>it dirt cheap, too; an&#x27; I want to tell you I could travel around</p>
<p>in a different tourin&#x27; car every day in the week just outa the</p>
<p>profits he makes on that ranch from the horses all the way from</p>
<p>heavy draughts to fancy steppers.</p>
<p>&quot;But how?--how?--how did he get it all?&quot; Saxon clamored.</p>
<p>&quot;By bein&#x27; wise to farmin&#x27;. Why, the whole blame family works.</p>
<p>They ain&#x27;t ashamed to roll up their sleeves an&#x27; dig--sons an&#x27;</p>
<p>daughters an&#x27; daughter-in-laws, old man, old woman, an&#x27; the</p>
<p>babies. They have a sayin&#x27; that a kid four years old that can&#x27;t</p>
<p>pasture one cow on the county road an&#x27; keep it fat ain&#x27;t worth</p>
<p>his salt. Why, the Silvas, the whole tribe of &#x27;em, works a</p>
<p>hundred acres in peas, eighty in tomatoes, thirty in asparagus,</p>
<p>ten in pie-plant, forty in cucumbers, an&#x27;--oh, stacks of other</p>
<p>things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how do they do it?&quot; Saxon continued to demand. &quot;We&#x27;ve never</p>
<p>been ashamed to work. We&#x27;ve worked hard all our lives. I can</p>
<p>out-work any Portuguese woman ever born. And I&#x27;ve done it, too,</p>
<p>in the jute mills. There were lots of Portuguese girls working at</p>
<p>the looms all around me, and I could out-weave them, every day,</p>
<p>and I did, too. It isn&#x27;t a case of work. What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>The lineman looked at her in a troubled way.</p>
<p>&quot;Many&#x27;s the time I&#x27;ve asked myself that same question. &#x27;We&#x27;re</p>
<p>better&#x27;n these cheap emigrants,&#x27; I&#x27;d say to myself. &#x27;We was here</p>
<p>first, an&#x27; owned the land. I can lick any Dago that ever hatched</p>
<p>in the Azores. I got a better education. Then how in thunder do</p>
<p>they put it all over us, get our land, an&#x27; start accounts in the</p>
<p>banks?&#x27; An&#x27; the only answer I know is that we ain&#x27;t got the sabe.</p>
<p>We don&#x27;t use our head-pieces right. Something&#x27;s wrong with us.</p>
<p>Anyway, we wasn&#x27;t wised up to farming. We played at it. Show you?</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what I brung you in for--the way old Silva an&#x27; all his</p>
<p>tribe farms. Book at this place. Some cousin of his, just out</p>
<p>from the Azores, is makin&#x27; a start on it, an&#x27; payin&#x27; good rent to</p>
<p>Silva. Pretty soon he&#x27;ll be up to snuff an&#x27; buyin&#x27; land for</p>
<p>himself from some perishin&#x27; American farmer.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at that--though you ought to see it in summer. Not an inch</p>
<p>wasted. Where we got one thin crop, they get four fat crops. An&#x27;</p>
<p>look at the way they crowd it--currants between the tree rows,</p>
<p>beans between the currant rows, a row of beans close on each side</p>
<p>of the trees, an&#x27; rows of beans along the ends of the tree rows.</p>
<p>Why, Silva wouldn&#x27;t sell these five acres for five hundred an</p>
<p>acre cash down. He gave grandfather fifty an acre for it on long</p>
<p>time, an&#x27; here am I, workin&#x27; for the telephone company an&#x27;</p>
<p>putting&#x27; in a telephone for old Silva&#x27;s cousin from the Azores</p>
<p>that can&#x27;t speak American yet. Horse-beans along the road--say,</p>
<p>when Silva swung that trick he made more outa fattenin&#x27; hogs with</p>
<p>&#x27;em than grandfather made with all his farmin&#x27;. Grandfather stuck</p>
<p>up his nose at horse-beans. He died with it stuck up, an&#x27; with</p>
<p>more mortgages on the land he had left than you could shake a</p>
<p>stick at. Plantin&#x27; tomatoes wrapped up in wrappin&#x27; paper--ever</p>
<p>heard of that? Father snorted when he first seen the Porchugeeze</p>
<p>doin&#x27; it. An&#x27; he went on snortin&#x27;. Just the same they got bumper</p>
<p>crops, an&#x27; father&#x27;s house-patch of tomatoes was eaten by the</p>
<p>black beetles. We ain&#x27;t got the sabe, or the knack, or something</p>
<p>or other. Just look at this piece of ground--four crops a year,</p>
<p>an&#x27; every inch of soil workin&#x27; over time. Why, back in town</p>
<p>there, there&#x27;s single acres that earns more than fifty of ours in</p>
<p>the old days. The Porchugeeze is natural-born farmers, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>all, an&#x27; we don&#x27;t know nothin&#x27; about farmin&#x27; an&#x27; never did.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon talked with the lineman, following him about, till one</p>
<p>o&#x27;clock, when he looked at his watch, said good bye, and returned</p>
<p>to his task of putting in a telephone for the latest immigrant</p>
<p>from the Azores.</p>
<p>When in town, Saxon carried her oilcloth-wrapped telescope in her</p>
<p>hand; but it was so arranged with loops, that, once on the road,</p>
<p>she could thrust her arms through the loops and carry it on her</p>
<p>back. When she did this, the tiny ukulele case was shifted so</p>
<p>that it hung under her left arm.</p>
<p>A mile on from the lineman, they stopped where a small creek,</p>
<p>fringed with brush, crossed the county road. Billy was for the</p>
<p>cold lunch, which was the last meal Saxon had prepared in the</p>
<p>Pine street cottage; but she was determined upon building a fire</p>
<p>and boiling coffee. Not that she desired it for herself, but that</p>
<p>she was impressed with the idea that everything at the starting</p>
<p>of their strange wandering must be as comfortable as possible for</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s sake. Bent on inspiring him with enthusiasm equal to her</p>
<p>own, she declined to dampen what sparks he had caught by anything</p>
<p>so uncheerful as a cold meal.</p>
<p>&quot;Now one thing we want to get out of our heads right at the</p>
<p>start, Billy, is that we&#x27;re in a hurry. We&#x27;re not in a hurry, and</p>
<p>we don&#x27;t care whether school keeps or not. We&#x27;re out to have a</p>
<p>good time, a regular adventure like you read about in books.--My!</p>
<p>I wish that boy that took me fishing to Goat Island could see me</p>
<p>now. Oakland was just a place to start from, he said. And, well,</p>
<p>we&#x27;ve started, haven&#x27;t we? And right here&#x27;s where we stop and</p>
<p>boil coffee. You get the fire going, Billy, and I&#x27;ll get the</p>
<p>water and the things ready to spread out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; Billy remarked, while they waited for the water to boil,</p>
<p>&quot;d&#x27;ye know what this reminds me of?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was certain she did know, but she shook her head. She</p>
<p>wanted to hear him say it.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, the second Sunday I knew you, when we drove out to Moraga</p>
<p>Valley behind Prince and King. You spread the lunch that day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only it was a more scrumptious lunch,&quot; she added, with a happy</p>
<p>smile.</p>
<p>&quot;But I wonder why we didn&#x27;t have coffee that day,&quot; he went on.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps it would have been too much like housekeeping,&quot; she</p>
<p>laughed; &quot;kind of what Mary would call indelicate--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or raw,&quot; Billy interpolated. &quot;She was always springin&#x27; that</p>
<p>word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet look what became of her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the way with all of them,&quot; Billy growled somberly. &quot;I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>always noticed it&#x27;s the fastidious, la-de-da ones that turn out</p>
<p>the rottenest. They&#x27;re like some horses I know, a-shyin&#x27; at the</p>
<p>things they&#x27;re the least afraid of.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was silent, oppressed by a sadness, vague and remote, which</p>
<p>the mention of Bert&#x27;s widow had served to bring on.</p>
<p>&quot;I know something else that happened that day which you&#x27;d never</p>
<p>guess,&quot; Billy reminisced. &quot;I bet you couldn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder,&quot; Saxon murmured, and guessed it with her eyes.</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s eyes answered, and quite spontaneously he reached over,</p>
<p>caught her hand, and pressed it caressingly to his cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s little, but oh my,&quot; he said, addressing the imprisoned</p>
<p>hand. Then he gazed at Saxon, and she warmed with his words.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re beginnin&#x27; courtin&#x27; all over again, ain&#x27;t we?&quot;</p>
<p>Both ate heartily, and Billy was guilty of three cups of coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, this country air gives some appetite,&quot; he mumbled, as he</p>
<p>sank his teeth into his fifth bread-and-meat sandwich. &quot;I could</p>
<p>eat a horse, an&#x27; drown his head off in coffee afterward.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s mind had reverted to all the young lineman had told her,</p>
<p>and she completed a sort of general resume of the information.</p>
<p>&quot;My!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;but we&#x27;ve learned a lot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; we&#x27;ve sure learned one thing,&quot; Billy said. &quot;An&#x27; that is that</p>
<p>this is no place for us, with land a thousan&#x27; an acre an&#x27; only</p>
<p>twenty dollars in our pockets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, we&#x27;re not going to stop here,&quot; she hastened to say.</p>
<p>&quot;But just the same it&#x27;s the Portuguese that gave it its price,</p>
<p>and they make things go on it--send their children to school...</p>
<p>and have them; and, as you said yourself, they&#x27;re as fat as</p>
<p>butterballs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I take my hat off to them,&quot; Billy responded.</p>
<p>&quot;But all the same, I&#x27;d sooner have forty acres at a hundred an</p>
<p>acre than four at a thousan&#x27; an acre. Somehow, you know, I&#x27;d be</p>
<p>scared stiff on four acres--scared of fallin&#x27; off, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>She was in full sympathy with him. In her heart of hearts the</p>
<p>forty acres tugged much the harder. In her way, allowing for the</p>
<p>difference of a generation, her desire for spaciousness was as</p>
<p>strong as her Uncle Will&#x27;s.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we&#x27;re not going to stop here,&quot; she assured Billy. &quot;We&#x27;re</p>
<p>going in, not for forty acres, but for a hundred and sixty acres</p>
<p>free from the government.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I guess the government owes it to us for what our fathers</p>
<p>an&#x27; mothers done. I tell you, Saxon, when a woman walks across</p>
<p>the plains like your mother done, an&#x27; a man an&#x27; wife gets</p>
<p>massacred by the Indians like my grandfather an&#x27; mother done, the</p>
<p>government does owe them something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it&#x27;s up to us to collect.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; we&#x27;ll collect all right, all right, somewhere down in them</p>
<p>redwood mountains south of Monterey.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>It was a good afternoon&#x27;s tramp to Niles, passing through the</p>
<p>town of Haywards; yet Saxon and Billy found time to diverge from</p>
<p>the main county road and take the parallel roads through acres of</p>
<p>intense cultivation where the land was farmed to the</p>
<p>wheel-tracks. Saxon looked with amazement at these small,</p>
<p>brown-skinned immigrants who came to the soil with nothing and</p>
<p>yet made the soil pay for itself to the tune of two hundred, of</p>
<p>five hundred, and of a thousand dollars an acre.</p>
<p>On every hand was activity. Women and children were in the fields</p>
<p>as well as men. The land was turned endlessly over and over. They</p>
<p>seemed never to let it rest. And it rewarded them. It must reward</p>
<p>them, or their children would not be able to go to school, nor</p>
<p>would so many of them be able to drive by in rattletrap,</p>
<p>second-hand buggies or in stout light wagons.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at their faces,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;They are happy and contented.</p>
<p>They haven&#x27;t faces like the people in our neighborhood after the</p>
<p>strikes began.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sure, they got a good thing,&quot; Billy agreed. &quot;You can see it</p>
<p>stickin&#x27; out all over them. But they needn&#x27;t get chesty with ME,</p>
<p>I can tell you that much--just because they&#x27;ve jiggerrooed us out</p>
<p>of our land an&#x27; everything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But they&#x27;re not showing any signs of chestiness,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>demurred.</p>
<p>&quot;No, they&#x27;re not, come to think of it. All the same, they ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>so wise. I bet I could tell &#x27;em a few about horses.&quot;</p>
<p>It was sunset when they entered the little town of Niles. Billy,</p>
<p>who had been silent for the last half mile, hesitantly ventured a</p>
<p>suggestion.</p>
<p>&quot;Say. .. I could put up for a room in the hotel just as well as</p>
<p>not. What d &#x27;ye think?&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon shook her head emphatically.</p>
<p>&quot;How long do you think our twenty dollars will last at that rate?</p>
<p>Besides, the only way to begin is to begin at the beginning. We</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t plan sleeping in hotels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; he gave in. &quot;I&#x27;m game. I was just thinkin&#x27; about</p>
<p>you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you&#x27;d better think I&#x27;m game, too,&quot; she flashed forgivingly.</p>
<p>&quot;And now we&#x27;ll have to see about getting things for supper.&quot;</p>
<p>They bought a round steak, potatoes, onions, and a dozen eating</p>
<p>apples, then went out from the town to the fringe of trees and</p>
<p>brush that advertised a creek. Beside the trees, on a sand bank,</p>
<p>they pitched camp. Plenty of dry wood lay about, and Billy</p>
<p>whistled genially while he gathered and chopped. Saxon, keen to</p>
<p>follow his every mood, was cheered by the atrocious discord on</p>
<p>his lips. She smiled to herself as she spread the blankets, with</p>
<p>the tarpaulin underneath, for a table, having first removed all</p>
<p>twigs from the sand. She had much to learn in the matter of</p>
<p>cooking over a camp-fire, and made fair progress, discovering,</p>
<p>first of all, that control of the fire meant far more than the</p>
<p>size of it. When the coffee was boiled, she settled the grounds</p>
<p>with a part-cup of cold water and placed the pot on the edge of</p>
<p>the coals where it would keep hot and yet not boil. She fried</p>
<p>potato dollars and onions in the same pan, but separately, and</p>
<p>set them on top of the coffee pot in the tin plate she was to eat</p>
<p>from, covering it with Billy&#x27;s inverted plate. On the dry hot</p>
<p>pan, in the way that delighted Billy, she fried the steak. This</p>
<p>completed, and while Billy poured the coffee, she served the</p>
<p>steak, putting the dollars and onions back into the frying pan</p>
<p>for a moment to make them piping hot again.</p>
<p>&quot;What more d&#x27;ye want than this?&quot; Billy challenged with deep-toned</p>
<p>satisfaction, in the pause after his final cup of coffee, while</p>
<p>he rolled a cigarette. He lay on his side, full length, resting</p>
<p>on his elbow. The fire was burning brightly, and Saxon&#x27;s color</p>
<p>was heightened by the flickering flames. &quot;Now our folks, when</p>
<p>they was on the move, had to be afraid for Indians, and wild</p>
<p>animals and all sorts of things; an&#x27; here we are, as safe as bugs</p>
<p>in a rug. Take this sand. What better bed could you ask? Soft as</p>
<p>feathers. Say--you look good to me, heap little squaw. I bet you</p>
<p>don&#x27;t look an inch over sixteen right now, Mrs.</p>
<p>Babe-in-the-Woods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t I?&quot; she glowed, with a flirt of the head sideward and a</p>
<p>white flash of teeth. &quot;If you weren&#x27;t smoking a cigarette I&#x27;d ask</p>
<p>you if your mother knew you&#x27;re out, Mr. Babe-in-the-Sandbank.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; he began, with transparently feigned seriousness. &quot;I want</p>
<p>to ask you something, if you don&#x27;t mind. Now, of course, I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>want to hurt your feelin&#x27;s or nothin&#x27;, but just the same there&#x27;s</p>
<p>something important I&#x27;d like to know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what is it?&quot; she inquired, after a fruitless wait.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it&#x27;s just this, Saxon. I like you like anything an&#x27; all</p>
<p>that, but here&#x27;s night come on, an&#x27; we&#x27;re a thousand miles from</p>
<p>anywhere, and--well, what I wanta know is: are we really an&#x27;</p>
<p>truly married, you an&#x27; me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really and truly,&quot; she assured him. &quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, nothing; but I&#x27;d kind a-forgotten, an&#x27; I was gettin&#x27;</p>
<p>embarrassed, you know, because if we wasn&#x27;t, seein&#x27; the way I was</p>
<p>brought up, this&#x27;d be no place--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That will do you,&quot; she said severely. &quot;And this is just the time</p>
<p>and place for you to get in the firewood for morning while I wash</p>
<p>up the dishes and put the kitchen in order.&quot;</p>
<p>He started to obey, but paused to throw his arm about her and</p>
<p>draw her close. Neither spoke, but when he went his way Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>breast was fluttering and a song of thanksgiving breathed on her</p>
<p>lips.</p>
<p>The night had come on, dim with the light of faint stars. But</p>
<p>these had disappeared behind clouds that seemed to have arisen</p>
<p>from nowhere. It was the beginning of California Indian summer.</p>
<p>The air was warm, with just the first hint of evening chill, and</p>
<p>there was no wind.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve a feeling as if we&#x27;ve just started to live,&quot; Saxon said,</p>
<p>when Billy, his firewood collected, joined her on the blankets</p>
<p>before the fire. &quot;I&#x27;ve learned more to-day than ten years in</p>
<p>Oakland.&quot; She drew a long breath and braced her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Farming&#x27;s a bigger subject than I thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy said nothing. With steady eyes he was staring into the</p>
<p>fire, and she knew he was turning something over in his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it,&quot; she asked, when she saw he had reached a</p>
<p>conclusion, at the same time resting her hand on the back of his.</p>
<p>&quot;Just been framin&#x27; up that ranch of ourn,&quot; he answered. &quot;It&#x27;s all</p>
<p>well enough, these dinky farmlets. They&#x27;ll do for foreigners. But</p>
<p>we Americans just gotta have room. I want to be able to look at a</p>
<p>hilltop an&#x27; know it&#x27;s my land, and know it&#x27;s my land down the</p>
<p>other side an&#x27; up the next hilltop, an&#x27; know that over beyond</p>
<p>that, down alongside some creek, my mares are most likely</p>
<p>grazin&#x27;, an&#x27; their little colts grazin&#x27; with &#x27;em or kickin&#x27; up</p>
<p>their heels. You know, there&#x27;s money in raisin&#x27;</p>
<p>horses--especially the big workhorses that run to eighteen</p>
<p>hundred an&#x27; two thousand pounds. They&#x27;re payin&#x27; for &#x27;em, in the</p>
<p>cities, every day in the year, seven an&#x27; eight hundred a pair,</p>
<p>matched geldings, four years old. Good pasture an&#x27; plenty of it,</p>
<p>in this kind of a climate, is all they need, along with some sort</p>
<p>of shelter an&#x27; a little hay in long spells of bad weather. I</p>
<p>never thought of it before, but let me tell you that this ranch</p>
<p>proposition is beginnin&#x27; to look good to ME.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was all excitement. Here was new information on the</p>
<p>cherished subject, and, best of all, Billy was the authority.</p>
<p>Still better, he was taking an interest himself.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;ll be room for that and for everything on a quarter</p>
<p>section,&quot; she encouraged.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing. Around the house we&#x27;ll have vegetables an&#x27; fruit and</p>
<p>chickens an&#x27; everything, just like the Porchugeeze, an&#x27; plenty of</p>
<p>room beside to walk around an&#x27; range the horses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But won&#x27;t the colts cost money, Billy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not much. The cobblestones eat horses up fast. That&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>get my brood mares, from the ones knocked out by the city. I know</p>
<p>THAT end of it. They sell &#x27;em at auction, an&#x27; they&#x27;re good for</p>
<p>years an&#x27; years, only no good on the cobbles any more.&quot;</p>
<p>There ensued a long pause. In the dying fire both were busy</p>
<p>visioning the farm to be.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s pretty still, ain&#x27;t it?&quot; Billy said, rousing himself at</p>
<p>last. He gazed about him. &quot;An&#x27; black as a stack of black cats.&quot;</p>
<p>He shivered, buttoned his coat, and tossed several sticks on the</p>
<p>fire. &quot;Just the same, it&#x27;s the best kind of a climate in the</p>
<p>world. Many&#x27;s the time, when I was a little kid, I&#x27;ve heard my</p>
<p>father brag about California&#x27;s bein&#x27; a blanket climate. He went</p>
<p>East, once, an&#x27; staid a summer an&#x27; a winter, an&#x27; got all he</p>
<p>wanted. Never again for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother said there never was such a land for climate. How</p>
<p>wonderful it must have seemed to them after crossing the deserts</p>
<p>and mountains. They called it the land of milk and honey. The</p>
<p>ground was so rich that all they needed to do was scratch it,</p>
<p>Cady used to say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And wild game everywhere,&quot; Billy contributed. &quot;Mr. Roberts, the</p>
<p>one that adopted my father, he drove cattle from the San Josquin</p>
<p>to the Columbia river. He had forty men helpin&#x27; him, an&#x27; all they</p>
<p>took along was powder an&#x27; salt. They lived off the game they</p>
<p>shot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The hills were full of deer, and my mother saw whole herds of</p>
<p>elk around Santa Rosa. Some time we&#x27;ll go there, Billy. I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>always wanted to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And when my father was a young man, somewhere up north of</p>
<p>Sacramento, in a creek called Cache Slough, the tules was full of</p>
<p>grizzliest He used to go in an&#x27; shoot &#x27;em. An&#x27; when they caught</p>
<p>&#x27;em in the open, he an&#x27; the Mexicans used to ride up an&#x27; rope</p>
<p>them--catch them with lariats, you know. He said a horse that</p>
<p>wasn&#x27;t afraid of grizzlies fetched ten times as much as any other</p>
<p>horse An&#x27; panthers!--all the old folks called &#x27;em painters an&#x27;</p>
<p>catamounts an&#x27; varmints. Yes, we&#x27;ll go to Santa Rosa some time.</p>
<p>Maybe we won&#x27;t like that land down the coast, an&#x27; have to keep on</p>
<p>hikin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>By this time the fire had died down, and Saxon had finished</p>
<p>brushing and braiding her hair. Their bed-going preliminaries</p>
<p>were simple, and in a few minutes they were side by side under</p>
<p>the blankets. Saxon closed her eyes, but could not sleep. On the</p>
<p>contrary, she had never been more wide awake. She had never slept</p>
<p>out of doors in her life, and by no exertion of will could she</p>
<p>overcome the strangeness of it. In addition, she was stiffened</p>
<p>from the long trudge, and the sand, to her surprise, was anything</p>
<p>but soft. An hour passed. She tried to believe that Billy was</p>
<p>asleep, but felt certain he was not. The sharp crackle of a dying</p>
<p>ember startled her. She was confident that Billy had moved</p>
<p>slightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Billy,&quot; she whispered, &quot;are you awake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep,&quot; came his low answer, &quot;--an&#x27; thinkin&#x27; this sand is harder&#x27;n</p>
<p>a cement floor. It&#x27;s one on me, all right. But who&#x27;d a-thought</p>
<p>it?&quot;</p>
<p>Both shifted their postures slightly, but vain was the attempt to</p>
<p>escape from the dull, aching contact of the sand.</p>
<p>An abrupt, metallic, whirring noise of some nearby cricket gave</p>
<p>Saxon another startle. She endured the sound for some minutes,</p>
<p>until Billy broke forth.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, that gets my goat whatever it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think it&#x27;s a rattlesnake?&quot; she asked, maintaining a</p>
<p>calmness she did not feel.</p>
<p>&quot;Just what I&#x27;ve been thinkin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw two, in the window of Bowman&#x27;s Drug Store An&#x27; you know,</p>
<p>Billy, they&#x27;ve got a hollow fang, and when they stick it into you</p>
<p>the poison runs down the hollow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Br-r-r-r,&quot; Billy shivered, in fear that was not altogether</p>
<p>mockery. &quot;Certain death, everybody says, unless you&#x27;re a Bosco.</p>
<p>Remember him7&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He eats &#x27;em alive! He eats &#x27;em alive! Bosco! Bosco!&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>responded, mimicking the cry of a side-show barker. Just the</p>
<p>same, all Bosco&#x27;s rattlers had the poison-sacs cut outa them.</p>
<p>They must a-had. Gee! It&#x27;s funny I can&#x27;t get asleep. I wish that</p>
<p>damned thing&#x27;d close its trap. I wonder if it is a rattlesnake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; it can&#x27;t be,&quot; Saxon decided. &quot;All the rattlesnakes are</p>
<p>killed off long ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then where did Bosco get his?&quot; Billy demanded with unimpeachable</p>
<p>logic. &quot;An&#x27; why don&#x27;t you get to sleep?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because it&#x27;s all new, I guess,&quot; was her reply. &quot;You see, I never</p>
<p>camped out in my life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither did I. An&#x27; until now I always thought it was a lark.&quot; He</p>
<p>changed his position on the maddening sand and sighed heavily.</p>
<p>&quot;But we&#x27;ll get used to it in time, I guess. What other folks can</p>
<p>do, we can, an&#x27; a mighty lot of &#x27;em has camped out. It&#x27;s all</p>
<p>right. Here we are, free an&#x27; independent, no rent to pay, our own</p>
<p>bosses&quot;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly. From somewhere in the brush came an</p>
<p>intermittent rustling. When they tried to locate it, it</p>
<p>mysteriously ceased, and when the first hint of drowsiness stole</p>
<p>upon them the rustling as mysteriously recommenced.</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds like something creeping up on us,&quot; Saxon suggested,</p>
<p>snuggling closer to Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it ain&#x27;t a wild Indian, at all events,&quot; was the best he</p>
<p>could offer in the way of comfort. He yawned deliberately. &quot;Aw,</p>
<p>shucks! What&#x27;s there to be scared of? Think of what all the</p>
<p>pioneers went through.&quot;</p>
<p>Several minutes later his shoulders began to shake, and Saxon</p>
<p>knew he was giggling.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just thinkin&#x27; of a yarn my father used to tell about,&quot; he</p>
<p>explained. &quot;It was about old Susan Kleghorn, one of the Oregon</p>
<p>pioneer women. Wall-Eyed Susan, they used to call her; but she</p>
<p>could shoot to beat the band. Once, on the Plains, the wagon</p>
<p>train she was in, was attacked by Indians. They got all the</p>
<p>wagons in a circle, an&#x27; all hands an&#x27; the oxen inside, an&#x27; drove</p>
<p>the Indians off, killin&#x27; a lot of &#x27;em. They was too strong that</p>
<p>way, so what&#x27;d the Indians do, to draw &#x27;em out into the open, but</p>
<p>take two white girls, captured from some other train, an&#x27; begin</p>
<p>to torture &#x27;em. They done it just out of gunshot, but so</p>
<p>everybody could see. The idea was that the white men couldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>stand it, an&#x27; would rush out, an&#x27; then the Indians&#x27;d have &#x27;em</p>
<p>where they wanted &#x27;em.</p>
<p>&quot;The white men couldn&#x27;t do a thing. If they rushed out to save</p>
<p>the girls, they&#x27;d be finished, an&#x27; then the Indians&#x27;d rush the</p>
<p>train. It meant death to everybody. But what does old Susan do,</p>
<p>but get out an old, long-barreled Kentucky rifle. She rams down</p>
<p>about three times the regular load of powder, takes aim at a big</p>
<p>buck that&#x27;s pretty busy at the torturin&#x27;, an&#x27; bangs away. It</p>
<p>knocked her clean over backward, an&#x27; her shoulder was lame all</p>
<p>the rest of the way to Oregon, but she dropped the big Indian</p>
<p>deado. He never knew what struck &#x27;m.</p>
<p>&quot;But that wasn&#x27;t the yarn I wanted to tell. It seems old Susan</p>
<p>liked John Barleycorn. She&#x27;d souse herself to the ears every</p>
<p>chance she got. An&#x27; her sons an&#x27; daughters an&#x27; the old man had to</p>
<p>be mighty careful not to leave any around where she could get</p>
<p>hands on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On what?&quot; asked Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;On John Barleycorn.--Oh, you ain&#x27;t on to that. It&#x27;s the old</p>
<p>fashioned name for whisky. Well, one day all the folks was goin&#x27;</p>
<p>away--that was over somewhere at a place called Bodega, where</p>
<p>they&#x27;d settled after comin&#x27; down from Oregon. An&#x27; old Susan</p>
<p>claimed her rheumatics was hurtin&#x27; her an&#x27; so she couldn&#x27;t go.</p>
<p>But the family was on. There was a two-gallon demijohn of whisky</p>
<p>in the house. They said all right, but before they left they sent</p>
<p>one of the grandsons to climb a big tree in the barnyard, where</p>
<p>he tied the demijohn sixty feet from the ground. Just the same,</p>
<p>when they come home that night they found Susan on the kitchen</p>
<p>floor dead to the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And she&#x27;d climbed the tree after all,&quot; Saxon hazarded, when</p>
<p>Billy had shown no inclination of going on.</p>
<p>&quot;Not on your life,&quot; he laughed jubilantly. &quot;All she&#x27;d done was to</p>
<p>put a washtub on the ground square under the demijohn. Then she</p>
<p>got out her old rifle an&#x27; shot the demijohn to smithereens, an&#x27;</p>
<p>all she had to do was lap the whisky outa the tub.&quot;</p>
<p>Again Saxon was drowsing, when the rustling sound was heard, this</p>
<p>time closer. To her excited apprehension there was something</p>
<p>stealthy about it, and she imagined a beast of prey creeping upon</p>
<p>them. &quot;Billy,&quot; she whispered.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I&#x27;m a-listenin&#x27; to it,&quot; came his wide awake answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Mightn&#x27;t that be a panther, or maybe ... a wildcat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It can&#x27;t be. All the varmints was killed off long ago. This is</p>
<p>peaceable farmin&#x27; country.&quot;</p>
<p>A vagrant breeze sighed through the trees and made Saxon shiver.</p>
<p>The mysterious cricket-noise ceased with suspicious abruptness.</p>
<p>Then, from the rustling noise, enslled a dull but heavy thump</p>
<p>that caused both Saxon and Billy to sit up in the blankets. There</p>
<p>were no further sounds, and they lay down again, though the very</p>
<p>silence now seemed ominous.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh,&quot; Billy muttered with relief. &quot;As though I don&#x27;t know what</p>
<p>it was. It was a rabbit. I&#x27;ve heard tame ones bang their hind</p>
<p>feet down on the floor that way.&quot;</p>
<p>In vain Saxon tried to win sleep. The sand grew harder with the</p>
<p>passage of time. Her flesh and her bones ached from contact with</p>
<p>it. And, though her reason flouted any possibility of wild</p>
<p>dangers, her fancy went on picturing them with unflagging zeal.</p>
<p>A new sound commenced. It was neither a rustling nor a rattling,</p>
<p>and it tokened some large body passing through the brush.</p>
<p>Sometimes twigs crackled and broke, and, once, they heard</p>
<p>bush-branches press aside and spring back into place.</p>
<p>&quot;If that other thing was a panther, this is an elephant,&quot; was</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s uncheering opinion. &quot;It&#x27;s got weight. Listen to that. An&#x27;</p>
<p>it&#x27;s comin&#x27; nearer.&quot;</p>
<p>There were frequent stoppages, then the sounds would begin again,</p>
<p>always louder, always closer. Billy sat up in the blankets once</p>
<p>more, passing one arm around Saxon, who had also sat up.</p>
<p>&quot;I ain&#x27;t slept a wink,&quot; he complained. &quot;--There it goes again. I</p>
<p>wish I could see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It makes a noise big enough for a grizzly,&quot; Saxon chattered,</p>
<p>partly from nervousness, partly from the chill of the night.</p>
<p>&quot;It ain&#x27;t no grasshopper, that&#x27;s sure.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy started to leave the blankets, but Saxon caught his arm.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I ain&#x27;t scairt none,&quot; he answered. &quot;But, honest to God, this</p>
<p>is gettin&#x27; on my nerves. If I don&#x27;t find what that thing is,</p>
<p>it&#x27;ll give me the willies. I&#x27;m just goin&#x27; to reconnoiter. I won&#x27;t</p>
<p>go close.&quot;</p>
<p>So intensely dark was the night, that the moment Billy crawled</p>
<p>beyond the reach of her hand he was lost to sight. She sat and</p>
<p>waited. The sound had ceased, though she could follow Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>progress by the cracking of dry twigs and limbs. After a few</p>
<p>moments he returned and crawled under the blankets.</p>
<p>&quot;I scared it away, I guess. It&#x27;s got better ears, an&#x27; when it</p>
<p>heard me comin&#x27; it skinned out most likely. I did my dangdest,</p>
<p>too, not to make a sound.--O Lord, there it goes again.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat up. Saxon nudged Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;There,&quot; she warned, in the faintest of whispers. &quot;I can hear it</p>
<p>breathing. It almost made a snort.&quot;</p>
<p>A dead branch cracked loudly, and so near at hand, that both of</p>
<p>them jumped shamelessly.</p>
<p>&quot;I ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to stand any more of its foolin&#x27;,&quot; Billy declared</p>
<p>wrathfully. &quot;It&#x27;ll be on top of us if I don&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; she queried anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Yell the top of my head off. I&#x27;ll get a fall outa whatever it</p>
<p>is.&quot;</p>
<p>He drew a deep breath and emitted a wild yell.</p>
<p>The result far exceeded any expectation he could have</p>
<p>entertained, and Saxon&#x27;s heart leaped up in sheer panic. On the</p>
<p>instant the darkness erupted into terrible sound and movement.</p>
<p>There were trashings of underbrush and lunges and plunges of</p>
<p>heavy bodies in different directions. Fortunately for their ease</p>
<p>of mind, all these sounds receded and died away.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; what d&#x27;ye think of that?&quot; Billy broke the silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee! all the fight fans used to say I was scairt of nothin&#x27;.</p>
<p>Just the same I&#x27;m glad they ain&#x27;t seein&#x27; me to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>He groaned. &quot;I&#x27;ve got all I want of that blamed sand. I&#x27;m goin&#x27;</p>
<p>to get up and start the fire.&quot;</p>
<p>This was easy. Under the ashes were live embers which quickly</p>
<p>ignited the wood he threw on. A few stars were peeping out in the</p>
<p>misty zenith. He looked up at them, deliberated, and started to</p>
<p>move away.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you going now?&quot; Saxon called.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I&#x27;ve got an idea,&quot; he replied noncommittally, and walked</p>
<p>boldly away beyond the circle of the firelight.</p>
<p>Saxon sat with the blankets drawn closely under her chin, and</p>
<p>admired his courage. He had not even taken the hatchet, and he</p>
<p>was going in the direction in which the disturbance had died</p>
<p>away.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later he came back chuckling.</p>
<p>&quot;The sons-of-guns, they got my goat all right. I&#x27;ll be scairt of</p>
<p>my own shadow next.--What was they? Huh! You couldn&#x27;t guess in a</p>
<p>thousand years. A bunch of half-grown calves, an&#x27; they was worse</p>
<p>scairt than us.&quot;</p>
<p>He smoked a cigarette by the fire, then rejoined Saxon under the</p>
<p>blankets.</p>
<p>&quot;A hell of a farmer I&#x27;ll make,&#x27;, he chafed, &quot;when a lot of little</p>
<p>calves can scare the stuffin&#x27; outa me. I bet your father or mine</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t a-batted an eye. The stock has gone to seed, that&#x27;s what</p>
<p>it has.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it hasn&#x27;t,&quot; Saxon defended. &quot;The stock is all right. We&#x27;re</p>
<p>just as able as our folks ever were, and we&#x27;re healthier on top</p>
<p>of it. We&#x27;ve been brought up different, that&#x27;s all. We&#x27;ve lived</p>
<p>in cities all our lives. We know the city sounds and thugs, but</p>
<p>we don&#x27;t know the country ones. Our training has been unnatural,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s the whole thing in a nutshell. Now we&#x27;re going in for</p>
<p>natural training. Give us a little time, and we&#x27;ll sleep as sound</p>
<p>out of doors as ever your father or mine did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But not on sand, &quot; Billy groaned.</p>
<p>&quot;We won&#x27;t try. That&#x27;s one thing, for good and all, we&#x27;ve learned</p>
<p>the very first time. And now hush up and go to sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>Their fears had vanished, but the sand, receiving now their</p>
<p>undivided attention, multiplied its unyieldingness. Billy dozed</p>
<p>off first, and roosters were crowing somewhere in the distance</p>
<p>when Saxon&#x27;s eyes closed. But they could not escape the sand, and</p>
<p>their sleep was fitful.</p>
<p>At the first gray of dawn, Billy crawled out and built a roaring</p>
<p>fire. Saxon drew up to it shiveringly. They were hollow-eyed and</p>
<p>weary. Saxon began to laugh. Billy joined sulkily, then</p>
<p>brightened up as his eyes chanced upon the coffee pot, which he</p>
<p>immediately put on to boil.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III</p>
<p>It is forty miles from Oakland to San Jose, and Saxon and Billy</p>
<p>accomplished it in three easy days. No more obliging and angrily</p>
<p>garrulous linemen were encountered, and few were the</p>
<p>opportunities for conversation with chance wayfarers. Numbers of</p>
<p>tramps, carrying rolls of blankets, were met, traveling both</p>
<p>north and south on the county road; and from talks with them</p>
<p>Saxon quickly learned that they knew little or nothing about</p>
<p>farming. They were mostly old men, feeble or besotted, and all</p>
<p>they knew was work--where jobs might be good, where jobs had been</p>
<p>good; but the places they mentioned were always a long way off.</p>
<p>One thing she did glean from them, and that was that the district</p>
<p>she and Billy were passing through was &quot;small-farmer&quot; country in</p>
<p>which labor was rarely hired, and that when it was it generally</p>
<p>was Portuguese.</p>
<p>The farmers themselves were unfriendly. They drove by Billy and</p>
<p>Saxon, often with empty wagons, but never invited them to ride.</p>
<p>When chance offered and Saxon did ask questions, they looked her</p>
<p>over curiously, or suspiciously, and gave ambiguous and</p>
<p>facetious answers.</p>
<p>&quot;They ain&#x27;t Americans, damn them,&quot; Billy fretted. &quot;Why, in the</p>
<p>old days everybody was friendly to everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon remembered her last talk with her brother.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the spirit of the times, Billy. The spirit has changed.</p>
<p>Besides, these people are too near. Wait till we get farther away</p>
<p>from the cities, then we&#x27;ll find them more friendly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A measly lot these ones are,&quot; he sneered.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they&#x27;ve a right to be,&quot; she laughed. &quot;For all you know,</p>
<p>more than one of the scabs you&#x27;ve slugged were sons of theirs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I could only hope so,&quot; Billy said fervently. &quot;But I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>care if I owned ten thousand acres, any man hikin&#x27; with his</p>
<p>blankets might be just as good a man as me, an&#x27; maybe better, for</p>
<p>all I&#x27;d know. I&#x27;d give &#x27;m the benefit of the doubt, anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy asked for work, at first, indiscriminately, later, only at</p>
<p>the larger farms. The unvarying reply was that there was no work.</p>
<p>A few said there would be plowing after the first rains. Here and</p>
<p>there, in a small way, dry plowing was going on. But in the main</p>
<p>the farmers were waiting.</p>
<p>&quot;But do you know how to plow?&quot; Saxon asked Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;No; but I guess it ain&#x27;t much of a trick to turn. Besides, next</p>
<p>man I see plowing I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to get a lesson from.&quot;</p>
<p>In the mid-afternoon of the second day his opportunity came. He</p>
<p>climbed on top of the fence of a small field and watched an old</p>
<p>man plow round and round it.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, shucks, just as easy as easy,&quot; Billy commented scornfully.</p>
<p>&quot;If an old codger like that can handle one plow, I can handle</p>
<p>two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go on and try it,&quot; Saxon urged.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the good?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cold feet,&quot; she jeered, but with a smiling face. &quot;All you have</p>
<p>to do is ask him. All he can do is say no. And what if he does?</p>
<p>You faced the Chicago Terror twenty rounds without flinching.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, but it&#x27;s different,&quot; he demurred, then dropped to the ground</p>
<p>inside the fence. &quot;Two to one the old geezer turns me down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, he won&#x27;t. Just tell him you want to learn, and ask him if</p>
<p>he&#x27;ll let you drive around a few times. Tell him it won&#x27;t cost</p>
<p>him anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh! If he gets chesty I&#x27;ll take his blamed plow away from</p>
<p>him.&quot;</p>
<p>From the top of the fence, but too far away to hear, Saxon</p>
<p>watched the colloquy. After several minutes, the lines were</p>
<p>transferred to Billy&#x27;s neck, the handles to his hands. Then the</p>
<p>team started, and the old man, delivering a rapid fire of</p>
<p>instructions, walked alongside of Billy. When a few turns had</p>
<p>been made, the farmer crossed the plowed strip to Saxon, and</p>
<p>joined her on the rail.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s plowed before, a little mite, ain&#x27;t he?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Never in his life. But he knows how to drive horses.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He showed he wasn&#x27;t all greenhorn, an&#x27; he learns pretty quick.&quot;</p>
<p>Here the farmer chuckled and cut himself a chew from a plug of</p>
<p>tobacco. &quot;I reckon he won&#x27;t tire me out a-settin&#x27; here.&quot;</p>
<p>The unplowed area grew smaller and smaller, but Billy evinced no</p>
<p>intention of quitting, and his audience on the fence was deep in</p>
<p>conversation. Saxon&#x27;s questions flew fast and furious, and she</p>
<p>was not long in concluding that the old man bore a striking</p>
<p>resemblance to the description the lineman had given of his</p>
<p>father.</p>
<p>Billy persisted till the field was finished, and the old man</p>
<p>invited him and Saxon to stop for the night. There was a disused</p>
<p>outbuilding where they would find a small cook stove, he said,</p>
<p>and also he would give them fresh milk. Further, if Saxon wanted</p>
<p>to test HER desire for farming, she could try her hand on the</p>
<p>cow.</p>
<p>The milking lesson did not prove as successful as Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>plowing; but when he had mocked sufficiently, Saxon challenged</p>
<p>him to try, and he failed as grievously as she. Saxon had eyes</p>
<p>and questions for everything, and it did not take her long to</p>
<p>realize that she was looking upon the other side of the farming</p>
<p>shield. Farm and farmer were old-fashioned. There was no</p>
<p>intensive cultivation. There was too much land too little farmed.</p>
<p>Everything was slipshod. House and barn and outbuildings were</p>
<p>fast falling into ruin. The front yard was weed-grown. There was</p>
<p>no vegetable garden. The small orchard was old, sickly, and</p>
<p>neglected. The trees were twisted, spindling, and overgrown with</p>
<p>a gray moss. The sons and daughters were away in the cities,</p>
<p>Saxon found out. One daughter had married a doctor, the other was</p>
<p>a teacher in the state normal school; one son was a locomotive</p>
<p>engineer, the second was an architect, and the third was a police</p>
<p>court reporter in San Francisco. On occasion, the father said,</p>
<p>they helped out the old folks.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think?&quot; Saxon asked Billy as he smoked his</p>
<p>after-supper cigarette.</p>
<p>His shoulders went up in a comprehensive shrug.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh! That&#x27;s easy. The old geezer&#x27;s like his orchard--covered</p>
<p>with moss. It&#x27;s plain as the nose on your face, after San</p>
<p>Leandro, that he don&#x27;t know the first thing. An&#x27; them horses.</p>
<p>It&#x27;d be a charity to him, an&#x27; a savin&#x27; of money for him, to take</p>
<p>&#x27;em out an&#x27; shoot &#x27;em both. You bet you don&#x27;t see the Porchugeeze</p>
<p>with horses like them. An&#x27; it ain&#x27;t a case of bein&#x27; proud, or</p>
<p>puttin&#x27; on side, to have good horses. It&#x27;s brass tacks an&#x27;</p>
<p>business. It pays. That&#x27;s the game. Old horses eat more in young</p>
<p>ones to keep in condition an&#x27; they can&#x27;t do the same amount of</p>
<p>work. But you bet it costs just as much to shoe them. An&#x27; his is</p>
<p>scrub on top of it. Every minute he has them horses he&#x27;s losin&#x27;</p>
<p>money. You oughta see the way they work an&#x27; figure horses in the</p>
<p>city.&quot;</p>
<p>They slept soundly, and, after an early breakfast, prepared to</p>
<p>start.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d like to give you a couple of days&#x27; work,&quot; the old man</p>
<p>regretted, at parting, &quot;but I can&#x27;t see it. The ranch just about</p>
<p>keeps me and the old woman, now that the children are gone. An&#x27;</p>
<p>then it don&#x27;t always. Seems times have been bad for a long spell</p>
<p>now. Ain&#x27;t never been the same since Grover Cleveland.&quot;</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon, on the outskirts of San Jose, Saxon</p>
<p>called a halt.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going right in there and talk,&quot; she declared, &quot;unless they</p>
<p>set the dogs on me. That&#x27;s the prettiest place yet, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy, who was always visioning hills and spacious ranges for his</p>
<p>horses, mumbled unenthusiastic assent.</p>
<p>&quot;And the vegetables! Look at them! And the flowers growing along</p>
<p>the borders! That beats tomato plants in wrapping paper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t see the sense of it,&quot; Billy objected. &quot;Where&#x27;s the money</p>
<p>come in from flowers that take up the ground that good vegetables</p>
<p>might be growin&#x27; on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to find out.&quot; She pointed to a woman,</p>
<p>stooped to the ground and working with a trowel; in front of the</p>
<p>tiny bungalow. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what she&#x27;s like, but at the worst</p>
<p>she can only be mean. See! She&#x27;s looking at us now. Drop your</p>
<p>load alongside of mine, and come on in.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy slung the blankets from his shoulder to the ground, but</p>
<p>elected to wait. As Saxon went up the narrow, flower-bordered</p>
<p>walk, she noted two men at work among the vegetables--one an old</p>
<p>Chinese, the other old and of some dark-eyed foreign breed. Here</p>
<p>were neatness, efficiency, and intensive cultivation with a</p>
<p>vengeance--even her untrained eye could see that. The woman stood</p>
<p>up and turned from her flowers, and Saxon saw that she was</p>
<p>middle-aged, slender, and simply but nicely dressed. She wore</p>
<p>glasses, and Saxon&#x27;s reading of her face was that it was kind but</p>
<p>nervous looking.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t want anything to-day,&quot; she said, before Saxon could</p>
<p>speak, administering the rebuff with a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>Saxon groaned inwardly over the black-covered telescope basket.</p>
<p>Evidently the woman had seen her put it down.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re not peddling,&quot; she explained quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I am sorry for the mistake.&quot;</p>
<p>This time the woman&#x27;s smile was even pleasanter, and she waited</p>
<p>for Saxon to state her errand.</p>
<p>Nothing loath, Saxon took it at a plunge.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re looking for land. We want to be farmers, you know, and</p>
<p>before we get the land we want to find out what kind of land we</p>
<p>want. And seeing your pretty place has just filled me up with</p>
<p>questions. You see, we don&#x27;t know anything about farming. We&#x27;ve</p>
<p>lived in the city all our life, and now we&#x27;ve given it up and are</p>
<p>going to live in the country and be happy.&quot;</p>
<p>She paused. The woman&#x27;s face seemed to grow quizzical, though the</p>
<p>pleasantness did not abate.</p>
<p>&quot;But how do you know you will be happy in the country?&quot; she</p>
<p>asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know. All I do know is that poor people can&#x27;t be happy</p>
<p>in the city where they have labor troubles all the time. If they</p>
<p>can&#x27;t be happy in the country, then there&#x27;s no happiness</p>
<p>anywhere, and that doesn&#x27;t seem fair, does it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is sound reasoning, my dear, as far as it goes. But you must</p>
<p>remember that there are many poor people in the country and many</p>
<p>unhappy people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You look neither poor nor unhappy,&quot; Saxon challenged.</p>
<p>&quot;You ARE a dear.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon saw the pleased flush in the other&#x27;s face, which lingered</p>
<p>as she went on.</p>
<p>&quot;But still, I may be peculiarly qualified to live and succeed in</p>
<p>the country. As you say yourself, you&#x27;ve spent your life in the</p>
<p>city. You don&#x27;t know the first thing about the country. It might</p>
<p>even break your heart.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s mind went back to the terrible months in the Pine street</p>
<p>cottage.</p>
<p>&quot;I know already that the city will break my heart. Maybe the</p>
<p>country will, too, but just the same it&#x27;s my only chance, don&#x27;t</p>
<p>you see. It&#x27;s that or nothing. Besides, our folks before us</p>
<p>were all of the country. It seems the more natural way. And</p>
<p>better, here I am, which proves that &#x27;way down inside I must want</p>
<p>the country, must, as you call it, be peculiarly qualified for</p>
<p>the country, or else I wouldn&#x27;t be here.&quot;</p>
<p>The other nodded approval, and looked at her with growing</p>
<p>interest.</p>
<p>&quot;That young man--&quot; she began.</p>
<p>&quot;Is my husband. He was a teamster until the big strike came. My</p>
<p>name is Roberts, Saxon Roberts, and my husband is William</p>
<p>Roberts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I am Mrs. Mortimer,&quot; the other said, with a bow of</p>
<p>acknowledgment. &quot;I am a widow. And now, if you will ask your</p>
<p>husband in, I shall try to answer some of your many questions.</p>
<p>Tell him to put the bundles inside the gate.... And now what are</p>
<p>all the questions you are filled with?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, all kinds. How does it pay? How did you manage it all? How</p>
<p>much did the land cost? Did you build that beautiful house? How</p>
<p>much do you pay the men1 How did you learn all the different</p>
<p>kinds of things, and which grew best and which paid best? What is</p>
<p>the best way to sell them? How do you sell them?&quot; Saxon paused</p>
<p>and laughed. &quot;Oh, I haven&#x27;t begun yet. Why do you have flowers on</p>
<p>the borders everywhere? I looked over the Portuguese farms around</p>
<p>San Leandro, but they never mixed flowers and vegetables.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer held up her hand. &quot;Let me answer the last first.</p>
<p>It is the key to almost everything.&quot;</p>
<p>But Billy arrived, and the explanation was deferred until after</p>
<p>his introduction.</p>
<p>&quot;The flowers caught your eyes, didn&#x27;t they, my dear?&quot; Mrs.</p>
<p>Mortimer resumed. &quot;And brought you in through my gate and right</p>
<p>up to me. And that&#x27;s the very reason they were planted with the</p>
<p>vegetables--to catch eyes. You can&#x27;t imagine how many eyes they</p>
<p>have caught, nor how many owners of eyes they have lured inside</p>
<p>my gate. This is a good road, and is a very popular short country</p>
<p>drive for townsfolk. Oh, no; I&#x27;ve never had any luck with</p>
<p>automobiles. They can&#x27;t see anything for dust. But I began when</p>
<p>nearly everybody still used carriages. The townswomen would drive</p>
<p>by. My flowers, and then my place, would catch their eyes. They</p>
<p>would tell their drivers to stop. And--well, somehow, I managed</p>
<p>to be in the front within speaking distance. Usually I succeeded</p>
<p>in invitlng them in to see my flowers... and vegetables, of</p>
<p>course. Everything was sweet, clean, pretty. It all appealed.</p>
<p>And--&quot; Mrs. Mortimer shrugged her shoulders. &quot;It is well known</p>
<p>that the stomach sees through the eyes. The thought of vegetables</p>
<p>growing among flowers pleased their fancy. They wanted my</p>
<p>vegetables. They must have them. And they did, at double the</p>
<p>market price, which they were only too glad to pay. You see, I</p>
<p>became the fashion, or a fad, in a small way. Nobody lost. The</p>
<p>vegetables were certainly good, as good as any on the market and</p>
<p>often fresher. And, besides, my customers killed two birds with</p>
<p>one stone; for they were pleased with themselves for</p>
<p>philanthropic reasons. Not only did they obtain the finest and</p>
<p>freshest possible vegetables, but at the same time they were</p>
<p>happy with the knowledge that they were helping a deserving</p>
<p>widow-woman. Yes, and it gave a certain tone to their</p>
<p>establishments to be able to say they bought Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s</p>
<p>vegetables. But that&#x27;s too big a side to go into. In short, my</p>
<p>little place became a show place--anywhere to go, for a drive or</p>
<p>anything, you know, when time has to be killed. And it became</p>
<p>noised about who I was, and who my husband had been, what I had</p>
<p>been. Some of the townsladies I had known personally in the old</p>
<p>days. They actually worked for my success. And then, too, I used</p>
<p>to serve tea. My patrons became my guests for the time being. I</p>
<p>still serve it, when they drive out to show me off to their</p>
<p>friends. So you see, the flowers are one of the ways I</p>
<p>succeeded.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was glowing with appreciation, but Mrs. Mortimer, glancing</p>
<p>at Billy, noted not entire approval. His blue eyes were clouded.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, out with it,&quot; she encouraged. &quot;What are you thinking?&quot;</p>
<p>To Saxon&#x27;s surprise, he answered directly, and to her double</p>
<p>surprise, his criticism was of a nature which had never entered</p>
<p>her head.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s just a trick,&quot; Billy expounded. &quot;That&#x27;s what I was gettin&#x27;</p>
<p>at--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But a paying trick,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer interrupted, her eyes dancing</p>
<p>and vivacious behind the glasses.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and no,&quot; Billy said stubbornly, speaking in his slow,</p>
<p>deliberate fashion. &quot;If every farmer was to mix flowers an&#x27;</p>
<p>vegetables, then every farmer would get double the market price,</p>
<p>an&#x27; then there wouldn&#x27;t be any double market price. Everything&#x27;d</p>
<p>be as it was before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are opposing a theory to a fact,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer stated. &quot;The</p>
<p>fact is that all the farmers do not do it. The fact is that I do</p>
<p>receive double the price. You can&#x27;t get away from that.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy was unconvinced, though unable to reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same,&quot; he muttered, with a slow shake of the head, &quot;I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t get the hang of it. There&#x27;s something wrong so far as we&#x27;re</p>
<p>concerned--my wife an&#x27; me, I mean. Maybe I&#x27;ll get hold of it</p>
<p>after a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And in the meantime, we&#x27;ll look around,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer invited.</p>
<p>&quot;I want to show you everything, and tell you how I make it go.</p>
<p>Afterward, we&#x27;ll sit down, and I&#x27;ll tell you about the beginning.</p>
<p>You see--&quot; she bent her gaze on Saxon--&quot;I want you thoroughly to</p>
<p>understand that you can succeed in the country if you go about it</p>
<p>right. I didn&#x27;t know a thing about it when I began, and I didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>have a fine big man like yours. I was all alone. But I&#x27;ll tell</p>
<p>you about that.&quot;</p>
<p>For the next hour, among vegetables, berry-bushes and fruit</p>
<p>trees, Saxon stored her brain with a huge mass of information to</p>
<p>be digested at her leisure. Billy, too, was interested, but he</p>
<p>left the talking to Saxon, himself rarely asking a question. At</p>
<p>the rear of the bungalow, where everything was as clean and</p>
<p>orderly as the front, they were shown through the chicken yard.</p>
<p>Here, in different runs, were kept several hundred small and</p>
<p>snow-white hens.</p>
<p>&quot;White Leghorns,&quot; said Mrs. Mortimer. &quot;You have no idea what they</p>
<p>netted me this year. I never keep a hen a moment past the prime</p>
<p>of her laying period--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just what I was tellin&#x27; you, Saxon, about horses,&quot; Billy broke</p>
<p>in.</p>
<p>&quot;And by the simplest method of hatching them at the right time,</p>
<p>which not one farmer in ten thousand ever dreams of doing, I have</p>
<p>them laying in the winter when most hens stop laying and when</p>
<p>eggs are highest. Another thing: I have my special customers.</p>
<p>They pay me ten cents a dozen more than the market price, because</p>
<p>my specialty is one-day eggs.&quot;</p>
<p>Here she chanced to glance at Billy, and guessed that he was</p>
<p>still wrestling with his problem.</p>
<p>&quot;Same old thing?&quot; she queried.</p>
<p>He nodded. &quot;Same old thing. If every farmer delivered day-old</p>
<p>eggs, there wouldn&#x27;t be no ten cents higher &#x27;n the top price.</p>
<p>They&#x27;d be no better off than they was before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the eggs would be one-day eggs, all the eggs would be</p>
<p>one-day eggs, you mustn&#x27;t forget that,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer pointed</p>
<p>out.</p>
<p>&quot;But that don&#x27;t butter no toast for my wife an&#x27; me,&quot; he objected.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been tryin&#x27; to get the hang of, an&#x27; now I</p>
<p>got it. You talk about theory an&#x27; fact. Ten cents higher than top</p>
<p>price is a theory to Saxon an&#x27; me. The fact is, we ain&#x27;t got no</p>
<p>eggs, no chickens, an&#x27; no land for the chickens to run an&#x27; lay</p>
<p>eggs on.&quot;</p>
<p>Their hostess nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; there&#x27;s something else about this outfit of yourn that I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t get the hang of,&quot; he pursued. &quot;I can&#x27;t just put my finger</p>
<p>on it, but it&#x27;s there all right.&quot;</p>
<p>They were shown over the cattery, the piggery, the milkers, and</p>
<p>the kennelry, as Mrs. Mortimer called her live stock departments.</p>
<p>None was large. All were moneymakers, she assured them, and</p>
<p>rattled off her profits glibly. She took their breaths away by</p>
<p>the prices given and received for pedigreed Persians, pedigreed</p>
<p>Ohio Improved Chesters, pedigreed Scotch collies, and pedigreed</p>
<p>Jerseys. For the milk of the last she also had a special private</p>
<p>market, receiving five cents more a quart than was fetched by the</p>
<p>best dairy milk. Billy was quick to point out the difference</p>
<p>between the look of her orchard and the look of the orchard they</p>
<p>had inspected the previous afternoon, and Mrs. Mortimer showed</p>
<p>him scores of other differences, many of which he was compelled</p>
<p>to accept on faith.</p>
<p>Then she told them of another industry, her home-made jams and</p>
<p>jellies, always contracted for in advance, and at prices</p>
<p>dizzyingly beyond the regular market. They sat in comfortable</p>
<p>rattan chairs on the veranda, while she told the story of how she</p>
<p>had drummed up the jam and jelly trade, dealing only with the one</p>
<p>best restaurant and one best club in San Jose. To the proprietor</p>
<p>and the steward she had gone with her samples, in long</p>
<p>discussions beaten down their opposition, overcome their</p>
<p>reluctance, and persuaded the proprietor, in particular, to make</p>
<p>a &quot;special&quot; of her wares, to boom them quietly with his patrons,</p>
<p>and, above all, to charge stiffly for dishes and courses in which</p>
<p>they appeared.</p>
<p>Throughout the recital Billy&#x27;s eyes were moody with</p>
<p>dissatisfaction. Mrs. Mortimer saw, and waited.</p>
<p>&quot;And now, begin at the beginning,&quot; Saxon begged.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Mortimer refused unless they agreed to stop for supper.</p>
<p>Saxon frowned Billy&#x27;s reluctance away, and accepted for both of</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer took up her tale, &quot;in the beginning I</p>
<p>was a greenhorn, city born and bred. All I knew of the country</p>
<p>was that it was a place to go to for vacations, and I always went</p>
<p>to springs and mountain and seaside resorts. I had lived among</p>
<p>books almost all my life. I was head librarian of the Doncaster</p>
<p>Library for years. Then I married Mr. Mortimer. He was a book</p>
<p>man, a professor in San Miguel University. He had a long</p>
<p>sickness, and when he died there was nothing left. Even his life</p>
<p>insurance was eaten into before I could be free of creditors. As</p>
<p>for myself, I was worn out, on the verge of nervous prostration,</p>
<p>fit for nothing. I had five thousand dollars left, however, and,</p>
<p>without going into the details, I decided to go farming. I found</p>
<p>this place, in a delightful climate, close to San Jose--the end</p>
<p>of the electric line is only a quarter of a mile on--and I bought</p>
<p>it. I paid two thousand cash, and gave a mortgage for two</p>
<p>thousand. It cost two hundred an acre, you see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty acres!&quot; Saxon cried.</p>
<p>&quot;Wasn&#x27;t that pretty small?&quot; Billy ventured.</p>
<p>&quot;Too large, oceans too large. I leased ten acres of it the first</p>
<p>thing. And it&#x27;s still leased after all this time. Even the ten</p>
<p>I&#x27;d retained was much too large for a long, long time. It&#x27;s only</p>
<p>now that I&#x27;m beginning to feel a tiny mite crowded.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And ten acres has supported you an&#x27; two hired men?&quot; Billy</p>
<p>demanded, amazed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer clapped her hands delightedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen. I had been a librarian. I knew my way among books. First</p>
<p>of all I&#x27;d read everything written on the subject, and subscribed</p>
<p>to some of the best farm magazines and papers. And you ask if my</p>
<p>ten acres have supported me and two hired men. Let me tell you. I</p>
<p>have four hired men. The ten acres certainly must support them,</p>
<p>as it supports Hannah--she&#x27;s a Swedish widow who runs the house</p>
<p>and who is a perfect Trojan during the jam and jelly season--and</p>
<p>Hannah&#x27;s daughter, who goes to school and lends a hand, and my</p>
<p>nephew whom I have taken to raise and educate. Also, the ten</p>
<p>acres have come pretty close to paying for the whole twenty, as</p>
<p>well as for this house, and all the outbuildings, and all the</p>
<p>pedigreed stock.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon remembered what the young lineman had said about the</p>
<p>Portuguese.</p>
<p>&quot;The ten acres didn&#x27;t do a bit of it,&quot; she cried. &quot;It was your</p>
<p>head that did it all, and you know it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#x27;s the point, my dear. It shows the right kind of person</p>
<p>can succeed in the country. Remember, the soil is generous. But</p>
<p>it must be treated generously, and that is something the old</p>
<p>style American farmer can&#x27;t get into his head. So it IS head that</p>
<p>counts. Even when his starving acres have convinced him of the</p>
<p>need for fertilizing, he can&#x27;t see the difference between cheap</p>
<p>fertilizer and good fertilizer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#x27;s something I want to know about,&quot; Saxon exclaimed. And</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell you all I know, but, first, you must be very tired. I</p>
<p>noticed you were limping. Let me take you in--never mind your</p>
<p>bundles; I&#x27;ll send Chang for them.&quot;</p>
<p>To Saxon, with her innate love of beauty and charm in all</p>
<p>personal things, the interior of the bungalow was a revelation.</p>
<p>Never before had she been inside a middle class home, and what</p>
<p>she saw not only far exceeded anything she had imagined, but was</p>
<p>vastly different from her imaginings. Mrs. Mortimer noted her</p>
<p>sparkling glances which took in everything, and went out of her</p>
<p>way to show Saxon around, doing it under the guise of gleeful</p>
<p>boastings, stating the costs of the different materials,</p>
<p>explaining how she had done things with her own hands, such as</p>
<p>staining the doors, weathering the bookcases, and putting</p>
<p>together the big Mission Morris chair. Billy stepped gingerly</p>
<p>behind, and though it never entered his mind to ape to the manner</p>
<p>born, he succeeded in escaping conspicuous awkwardness, even at</p>
<p>the table where he and Saxon had the unique experience of being</p>
<p>waited on in a private house by a servant.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#x27;d only come along next year,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer mourned;</p>
<p>&quot;then I should have had the spare room I had planned--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s all right,&quot; Billy spoke up; &quot;thank you just the same. But</p>
<p>we&#x27;ll catch the electric cars into San Jose an&#x27; get a room.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer was still disturbed at her inability to put them up</p>
<p>for the night, and Saxon changed the conversation by pleading to</p>
<p>be told more.</p>
<p>&quot;You remember, I told you I&#x27;d paid only two thousand down on the</p>
<p>land,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer complied. &quot;That left me three thousand to</p>
<p>experiment with. Of course, all my friends and relatives</p>
<p>prophesied failure. And, of course, I made my mistakes, plenty of</p>
<p>them, but I was saved from still more by the thorough study I had</p>
<p>made and continued to make.&quot; She indicated shelves of farm books</p>
<p>and files of farm magazines that lined the walls. &quot;And I</p>
<p>continued to study. I was resolved to be up to date, and I sent</p>
<p>for all the experiment station reports. I went almost entirely on</p>
<p>the basis that whatever the old type farmer did was wrong, and,</p>
<p>do you know, in doing that I was not so far wrong myself. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>almost unthinkable, the stupidity of the old-fashioned farmers.</p>
<p>Oh, I consulted with them, talked things over with them,</p>
<p>challenged their stereotyped ways, demanded demonstration of</p>
<p>their dogmatic and prejudiced beliefs, and quite succeeded in</p>
<p>convincing the last of them that I was a fool and doomed to come</p>
<p>to grief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you didn&#x27;t! You didn&#x27;t!&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer smiled gratefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, even now, I&#x27;m amazed that I didn&#x27;t. But I came of a</p>
<p>hard-headed stock which had been away from the soil long enough</p>
<p>to gain a new perspective. When a thing satisfied my judgment, I</p>
<p>did it forthwith and downright, no matter how extravagant it</p>
<p>seemed. Take the old orchard. Worthless! Worse than worthless!</p>
<p>Old Calkins nearly died of heart disease when he saw the</p>
<p>devastation I had wreaked upon it. And look at it now. There was</p>
<p>an old rattletrap ruin where the bungalow now stands. I put up</p>
<p>with it, but I immediately pulled down the cow barn, the</p>
<p>pigsties, the chicken houses, everything--made a clean sweep.</p>
<p>They shook their heads and groaned when they saw such wanton</p>
<p>waste by a widow struggling to make a living. But worse was to</p>
<p>come. They were paralyzed when I told them the price of the three</p>
<p>beautiful O.I.C.&#x27;s--pigs, you know, Chesters--which I bought,</p>
<p>sixty dollars for the three, and only just weaned. Then I hustled</p>
<p>the nondescript chickens to market, replacing them with the White</p>
<p>Leghorns. The two scrub cows that came with the place I sold to</p>
<p>the butcher for thirty dollars each, paying two hundred and fifty</p>
<p>for two blue-blooded Jersey heifers .. . and coined money on the</p>
<p>exchange, while Calkins and the rest went right on with their</p>
<p>scrubs that couldn&#x27;t give enough milk to pay for their board.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy nodded approval.</p>
<p>&quot;Remember what I told you about horses,&quot; he reiterated to Saxon;</p>
<p>and, assisted by his hostess, he gave a very creditable</p>
<p>disquisition on horseflesh and its management from a business</p>
<p>point of view.</p>
<p>When he went out to smoke Mrs. Mortimer led Saxon into talking</p>
<p>about herself and Billy, and betrayed not the slightest shock</p>
<p>when she learned of his prizefighting and scab-slugging</p>
<p>proclivities.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s a splendid young man, and good,&quot; she assured Saxon. &quot;His</p>
<p>face shows that. And, best of all, he loves you and is proud of</p>
<p>you. You can&#x27;t imagine how I have enjoyed watching the way he</p>
<p>looks at you, especially when you are talking. He respects your</p>
<p>judgment. Why, he must, for here he is with you on this</p>
<p>pilgrimage which is wholly your idea.&quot; Mrs. Mortimer sighed. &quot;You</p>
<p>are very fortunate, dear child, very fortunate. And you don&#x27;t yet</p>
<p>know what a man&#x27;s brain is. Wait till he is quite fired with</p>
<p>enthusiasm for your project. You will be astounded by the way he</p>
<p>takes hold. You will have to exert yourself to keep up with him.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you must lead. Remember, he is city bred. It</p>
<p>will be a struggle to wean him from the only life he&#x27;s known.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but he&#x27;s disgusted with the city, too--&quot; Saxon began.</p>
<p>&quot;But not as you are. Love is not the whole of man, as it is of</p>
<p>woman. The city hurt you more than it hurt him. It was you who</p>
<p>lost the dear little babe. His interest, his connection, was no</p>
<p>more than casual and incidental compared with the depth and</p>
<p>vividness of yours.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer turned her head to Billy, who was just entering.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you got the hang of what was bothering you?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty close to it,&quot; he answered, taking the indicated big</p>
<p>Morris chair. &quot;It&#x27;s this--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One moment,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer checked him. &quot;That is a beautiful,</p>
<p>big, strong chair, and so are you, at any rate big and strong,</p>
<p>and your little wife is very weary--no, no; sit down, it&#x27;s your</p>
<p>strength she needs. Yes, I insist. Open your arms.&quot;</p>
<p>And to him she led Saxon, and into his arms placed her. &quot;Now,</p>
<p>sir--and you look delicious, the pair of you--register your</p>
<p>objections to my way of earning a living.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It ain&#x27;t your way,&quot; Billy repudiated quickly. &quot;Your way&#x27;s all</p>
<p>right. It&#x27;s great. What I&#x27;m trying to get at is that your way</p>
<p>don&#x27;t fit us. We couldn&#x27;t make a go of it your way. Why you had</p>
<p>pull--well-to-do acquaintances, people that knew you&#x27;d been a</p>
<p>librarian an&#x27; your husband a professor. An&#x27; you had...&quot; Here he</p>
<p>floundered a moment, seeking definiteness for the idea he still</p>
<p>vaguely grasped. &quot;Well, you had a way we couldn&#x27;t have. You were</p>
<p>educated, an&#x27;... an&#x27;--I don&#x27;t know, I guess you knew society</p>
<p>ways an&#x27; business ways we couldn&#x27;t know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, my dear boy, you could learn what was neeessary,&quot; she</p>
<p>contended.</p>
<p>Billy shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;No. You don&#x27;t quite get me. Let&#x27;s take it this way. Just suppose</p>
<p>it&#x27;s me, with jam an&#x27; jelly, a-wadin&#x27; into that swell restaurant</p>
<p>like you did to talk with the top guy. Why, I&#x27;d be outa place the</p>
<p>moment I stepped into his office. Worse&#x27;n that, I&#x27;d feel outa</p>
<p>place. That&#x27;d make me have a chip on my shoulder an&#x27; lookin&#x27; for</p>
<p>trouble, which is a poor way to do business. Then, too, I&#x27;d be</p>
<p>thinkin&#x27; he was thinkin&#x27; I was a whole lot of a husky to be</p>
<p>peddlin&#x27; jam. What&#x27;d happen, I&#x27;d be chesty at the drop of the</p>
<p>hat. I&#x27;d be thinkin&#x27; he was thinkin&#x27; I was standin&#x27; on my foot,</p>
<p>an&#x27; I&#x27;d beat him to it in tellin&#x27; him he was standin&#x27; on HIS</p>
<p>foot. Don&#x27;t you see? It&#x27;s because I was raised that way. It&#x27;d be</p>
<p>take it or leave it with me, an&#x27; no jam sold.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What you say is true, &quot; Mrs. Mortimer took up brightly. &quot;But</p>
<p>there is your wife. Just look at her. She&#x27;d make an impression on</p>
<p>any business man. He&#x27;d be only too willing to listen to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy stiffened, a forbidding expression springing into his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;What have I done now?&quot; their hostess laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;I ain&#x27;t got around yet to tradin&#x27; on my wife&#x27;s looks,&quot; he</p>
<p>rumbled gruffly.</p>
<p>&quot;Right you are. The only trouble is that you, both of you, are</p>
<p>fifty years behind the times. You&#x27;re old Ameriean. How you ever</p>
<p>got here in the thick of modern conditions is a miracle. You&#x27;re</p>
<p>Rip Van Winkles. Who ever heard, in these degenerate times, of a</p>
<p>young man and woman of the city putting their blankets on their</p>
<p>backs and starting out in search of land? Why, it&#x27;s the old</p>
<p>Argonaut spirit. You&#x27;re as like as peas in a pod to those who</p>
<p>yoked their oxen and held west to the lands beyond the sunset.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll wager your fathers and mothers, or grandfathers and</p>
<p>grandmothers, were that very stock.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s eyes were glistening, and Billy&#x27;s were friendly once</p>
<p>more. Both nodded their heads.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m of the old stock myself,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer went on proudly. &quot;My</p>
<p>grandmother was one of the survivors of the Donner Party. My</p>
<p>grandfather, Jason Whitney, came around the Horn and took part in</p>
<p>the raising of the Bear Flag at Sonoma. He was at Monterey when</p>
<p>John Marshall discovered gold in Sutter&#x27;s mill-race. One of the</p>
<p>streets in San Francisco is named after him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know it,&quot; Billy put in. &quot;Whitney Street. It&#x27;s near Russian</p>
<p>Hill. Saxon&#x27;s mother walked across the Plains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Billy&#x27;s grandfather and grandmother were massacred by the</p>
<p>Indians,&quot; Saxon contributed. &quot;His father was a little baby boy,</p>
<p>and lived with the Indians, until captured by the whites. He</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t even know his name and was adopted by a Mr. Roberts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you two dear children, we&#x27;re almost like relatives,&quot; Mrs.</p>
<p>Mortimer beamed. &quot;It&#x27;s a breath of old times, alas! all forgotten</p>
<p>in these fly-away days. I am especially interested, because I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>catalogued and read everything covering those times. You--&quot; she</p>
<p>indicated Billy, &quot;you are historical, or at least your father is.</p>
<p>I remember about him. The whole thing is in Bancroft&#x27;s History.</p>
<p>It was the Modoc Indians. There were eighteen wagons. Your father</p>
<p>was the only survivor, a mere baby at the time, with no knowledge</p>
<p>of what happened. He was adopted by the leader of the whites.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; said Billy. &quot;It was the Modocs. His train must</p>
<p>have ben bound for Oregon. It was all wiped out. I wonder if you</p>
<p>know anything about Saxon&#x27;s mother. She used to write poetry in</p>
<p>the early days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was any of it printed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Saxon answered. &quot;In the old San Jose papers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And do you know any of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, there&#x27;s one beginning:</p>
<p>&#x27;Sweet as the wind-lute&#x27;s airy strains</p>
<p>Your gentle muse has learned to sing,</p>
<p>And California&#x27;s boundless plains</p>
<p>Prolong the soft notes echoing.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It sounds familiar,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer said, pondering.</p>
<p>&quot;And there was another I remember that began:</p>
<p>&#x27;I&#x27;ve stolen away from the crowd in the groves,</p>
<p>Where the nude statues stand, and the leaves point and shiver,&#x27;--</p>
<p>&quot;And it run on like that. I don&#x27;t understand it all. It was</p>
<p>written to my father--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A love poem!&quot; Mrs. Mortimer broke in. &quot;I remember it. Wait a</p>
<p>minute... Da-da-dah, da-da-dah, da-da-dah, da-da--STANDS--</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;In the spray of a fountain, whose seed-amethysts</p>
<p>Tremble lightly a moment on bosom and hands,</p>
<p>Then drip in their basin from bosom and wrists.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve never forgotten the drip of the seed-amethysts, though I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t remember your mother&#x27;s name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was Daisy--&quot; Saxon began.</p>
<p>&quot;No; Dayelle,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer corrected with quickening</p>
<p>recollection.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, but nobody called her that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But she signed it that way. What is the rest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Daisy Wiley Brown.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer went to the bookshelves and quickly returned with a</p>
<p>large, soberly-bound volume.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s &#x27;The Story of the Files,&#x27;&quot; she explained. &quot;Among other</p>
<p>things, all the good fugitive verse was gathered here from the</p>
<p>old newspaper files.&quot; Her eyes running down the index suddenly</p>
<p>stopped. &quot;I was right. Dayelle Wiley Brown. There it is. Ten of</p>
<p>her poems, too: &#x27;The Viking&#x27;s Quest&#x27;; &#x27;Days of Gold&#x27;;</p>
<p>&#x27;Constancy&#x27;; &#x27;The Caballero&#x27;; &#x27;Graves at Little Meadow&#x27;--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We fought off the Indians there,&quot; Saxon interrupted in her</p>
<p>excitement. &quot;And mother, who was only a little girl, went out and</p>
<p>got water for the wounded. And the Indians wouldn&#x27;t shoot at her.</p>
<p>Everybody said it was a miracle.&quot; She sprang out of Billy&#x27;s arms,</p>
<p>reaching for the book and crying: &quot;Oh, let me see it! Let me see</p>
<p>it! It&#x27;s all new to me. I don&#x27;t know these poems. Can I copy</p>
<p>them? I&#x27;ll learn them by heart. Just to think, my mother&#x27;s!&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s glasses required repolishing; and for half an</p>
<p>hour she and Billy remained silent while Saxon devoured her</p>
<p>mother&#x27;s lines. At the end, staring at the book which she had</p>
<p>closed on her finger, she could only repeat in wondering awe:</p>
<p>&quot;And I never knew, I never knew.&quot;</p>
<p>But during that half hour Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s mind had not been idle.</p>
<p>A little later, she broached her plan. She believed in intensive</p>
<p>dairying as well as intensive farming, and intended, as soon as</p>
<p>the lease expired, to establish a Jersey dairy on the other ten</p>
<p>acres. This, like everything she had done, would be model, and it</p>
<p>meant that she would require more help. Billy and Saxon were just</p>
<p>the two. By next summer she could have them installed in the</p>
<p>cottage she intended building. In the meantime she could arrange,</p>
<p>one way and another, to get work for Billy through the winter.</p>
<p>She would guarantee this work, and she knew a small house they</p>
<p>could rent just at the end of the car-line. Under her supervision</p>
<p>Billy could take charge from the very beginning of the building.</p>
<p>In this way they would be earning money, preparing themselves for</p>
<p>independent farming life, and have opportunity to look about</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>But her persuasions were in vain. In the end Saxon succinctly</p>
<p>epitomized their point of view.</p>
<p>&quot;We can&#x27;t stop at the first place, even if it is as beautiful and</p>
<p>kind as yours and as nice as this valley is. We don&#x27;t even know</p>
<p>what we want. We&#x27;ve got to go farther, and see all kinds of</p>
<p>places and all kinds of ways, in order to find out. We&#x27;re not in</p>
<p>a hurry to make up our minds. We want to make, oh, so very sure!</p>
<p>And besides...&quot; She hesitated. &quot;Besides, we don&#x27;t like</p>
<p>altogether flat land. Billy wants some hills in his. And so do</p>
<p>I.&quot;</p>
<p>When they were ready to leave Mrs. Mortimer offered to present</p>
<p>Saxon with &quot;The Story of the Files&quot;; but Saxon shook her head and</p>
<p>got some money from Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;It says it costs two dollars,&quot; she said. &quot;Will you buy me one,</p>
<p>and keep it till we get settled? Then I&#x27;ll write, and you can</p>
<p>send it to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you Americans,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer chided, accepting the money.</p>
<p>&quot;But you must promise to write from time to time before you&#x27;re</p>
<p>settled.&quot;</p>
<p>She saw them to the county road.</p>
<p>&quot;You are brave young things,&quot; she said at parting. &quot;I only wish I</p>
<p>were going with you, my pack upon my back. You&#x27;re perfectly</p>
<p>glorious, the pair of you. If ever I can do anything for you,</p>
<p>just let me know. You&#x27;re bound to succeed, and I want a hand in</p>
<p>it myself. Let me know how that government land turns out,</p>
<p>though I warn you I haven&#x27;t much faith in its feasibility. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>sure to be too far away from markets.&quot;</p>
<p>She shook hands with Billy. Saxon she caught into her arms and</p>
<p>kissed.</p>
<p>&quot;Be brave,&quot; she said, with low earnestness, in Saxon&#x27;s ear.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll win. You are starting with the right ideas. And you were</p>
<p>right not to accept my proposition. But remember, it, or better,</p>
<p>will always be open to you. You&#x27;re young yet, both of you. Don&#x27;t</p>
<p>be in a hurry. Any time you stop anywhere for a while, let me</p>
<p>know, and I&#x27;ll mail you heaps of agricultural reports and farm</p>
<p>publications. Good-bye. Heaps and heaps and heaps of luck.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
<p>Bill sat motionless on the edge of the bed in their little room</p>
<p>in San Jose that night, a musing expression in his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he remarked at last, with a long-drawn breath, &quot;all I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>got to say is there&#x27;s some pretty nice people in this world after</p>
<p>all. Take Mrs. Mortimer. Now she&#x27;s the real goods--regular old</p>
<p>American.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A fine, educated lady,&quot; Saxon agreed, &quot;and not a bit ashamed to</p>
<p>work at farming herself. And she made it go, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On twenty acres--no, ten; and paid for &#x27;em, an&#x27; all</p>
<p>improvements, an&#x27; supported herself, four hired men, a Swede</p>
<p>woman an&#x27; daughter, an&#x27; her own nephew. It gets me. Ten acres!</p>
<p>Why, my father never talked less&#x27;n one hundred an&#x27; sixty acres.</p>
<p>Even your brother Tom still talks in quarter sections.--An&#x27; she</p>
<p>was only a woman, too. We was lucky in meetin&#x27; her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wasn&#x27;t it an adventure!&quot; Saxon cried. &quot;That&#x27;s what comes of</p>
<p>traveling. You never know what&#x27;s going to happen next. It jumped</p>
<p>right out at us, just when we were tired and wondering how much</p>
<p>farther to San Jose. We weren&#x27;t expecting it at all. And she</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t treat us as if we were tramping. And that house--so clean</p>
<p>and beautiful. You could eat off the floor. I never dreamed of</p>
<p>anything so sweet and lovely as the inside of that house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It smelt good,&quot; Billy supplied.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the very thing. It&#x27;s what the women&#x27;s pages call</p>
<p>atmosphere. I didn&#x27;t know what they meant before. That house has</p>
<p>beautiful, sweet atmosphere--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like all your nice underthings,&quot; said Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#x27;s the next step after keeping your body sweet and clean</p>
<p>and beautiful. It&#x27;s to have your house sweet and clean and</p>
<p>beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it can&#x27;t be a rented one, Saxon. You&#x27;ve got to own it.</p>
<p>Landlords don&#x27;t build houses like that. Just the same, one thing</p>
<p>stuck out plain: that house was not expensive. It wasn&#x27;t the</p>
<p>cost. It was the way. The wood was ordinary wood you can buy in</p>
<p>any lumber yard. Why, our house on Pine street was made out of</p>
<p>the same kind of wood. But the way it was made was different. I</p>
<p>can&#x27;t explain, but you can see what I&#x27;m drivin&#x27; at.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon, revisioning the little bungalow they had just left,</p>
<p>repeated absently: &quot;That&#x27;s it--the way.&quot;</p>
<p>The next morning they were early afoot, seeking through the</p>
<p>suburbs of San Jose the road to San Juan and Monterey. Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>limp had increased. Beginning with a burst blister, her heel was</p>
<p>skinning rapidly. Billy remembered his father&#x27;s talks about care</p>
<p>of the feet, and stopped at a butcher shop to buy five cents&#x27;</p>
<p>worth of mutton tallow.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the stuff,&quot; he told Saxon. &quot;Clean foot-gear and the feet</p>
<p>well greased. We&#x27;ll put some on as soon as we&#x27;re clear of town.</p>
<p>An&#x27; we might as well go easy for a couple of days. Now, if I</p>
<p>could get a little work so as you could rest up several days it&#x27;d</p>
<p>be just the thing. I &#x27;11 keep my eye peeled.&quot;</p>
<p>Almost on the outskirts of town he left Saxon on the county road</p>
<p>and went up a long driveway to what appeared a large farm. He</p>
<p>came back beaming.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all hunkydory,&quot; he called as he approached. &quot;We&#x27;ll just go</p>
<p>down to that clump of trees by the creek an&#x27; pitch camp. I start</p>
<p>work in the mornin&#x27;, two dollars a day an&#x27; board myself. It&#x27;d</p>
<p>been a dollar an&#x27; a half if he furnished the board. I told &#x27;m I</p>
<p>liked the other way best, an&#x27; that I had my camp with me. The</p>
<p>weather&#x27;s fine, an&#x27; we can make out a few days till your foot&#x27;s</p>
<p>in shape. Come on. We&#x27;ll pitch a regular, decent camp.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you get the job,&quot; Saxon asked, as they cast about,</p>
<p>determining their camp-site.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait till we get fixed an&#x27; I&#x27;ll tell you all about it. It was a</p>
<p>dream, a cinch.&quot;</p>
<p>Not until the bed was spread, the fire built, and a pot of</p>
<p>beans boiling did Billy throw down the last armful of wood and</p>
<p>begin.</p>
<p>&quot;In the first place, Benson&#x27;s no old-fashioned geezer. You</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t think he was a farmer to look at &#x27;m. He&#x27;s up to date,</p>
<p>sharp as tacks, talks an&#x27; acts like a business man. I could see</p>
<p>that, just by lookin&#x27; at his place, before I seen HIM. He took</p>
<p>about fifteen seconds to size me up.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Can you plow?&#x27; says he.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Sure thing,&#x27; I told &#x27;m.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Know horses?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I was hatched in a box-stall,&#x27; says I.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; just then--you remember that four-horse load of machinery</p>
<p>that come in after me?--just then it drove up.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;How about four horses?&#x27; he asks, casual-like.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Right to home. I can drive &#x27;m to a plow, a sewin&#x27; machine, or a</p>
<p>merry-go-round.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Jump up an&#x27; take them lines, then,&#x27; he says, quick an&#x27; sharp,</p>
<p>not wastin&#x27; seconds. &#x27;See that shed. Go &#x27;round the barn to the</p>
<p>right an&#x27; back in for unloadin&#x27;.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; right here I wanta tell you it was some nifty drivin&#x27; he was</p>
<p>askin&#x27;. I could see by the tracks the wagons&#x27;d all ben goin&#x27;</p>
<p>around the barn to the left. What he was askin&#x27; was too close</p>
<p>work for comfort--a double turn, like an S, between a corner of a</p>
<p>paddock an&#x27; around the corner of the barn to the last swing. An&#x27;,</p>
<p>to eat into the little room there was, there was piles of manure</p>
<p>just thrown outa the barn an&#x27; not hauled away yet. But I wasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>lettin&#x27; on nothin&#x27;. The driver gave me the lines, an&#x27; I could see</p>
<p>he was grinnin&#x27;, sure I&#x27;d make a mess of it. I bet he couldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>a-done it himself. I never let on, an away we went, me not even</p>
<p>knowin&#x27; the horses--but, say, if you&#x27;d seen me throw them leaders</p>
<p>clean to the top of the manure till the nigh horse was scrapin&#x27;</p>
<p>the side of the barn to make it, an&#x27; the off hind hub was cuttin&#x27;</p>
<p>the corner post of the paddock to miss by six inches. It was the</p>
<p>only way. An&#x27; them horses was sure beauts. The leaders slacked</p>
<p>back an&#x27; darn near sat down on their singletrees when I threw the</p>
<p>back into the wheelers an&#x27; slammed on the brake an&#x27; stopped on</p>
<p>the very precise spot.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You&#x27;ll do,&#x27; Benson says. &#x27;That was good</p>
<p>work.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Aw, shucks,&#x27; I says, indifferent as hell. &#x27;Gimme something real</p>
<p>hard.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;He smiles an&#x27; understands.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;You done that well,&#x27; he says. &#x27;An&#x27; I&#x27;m particular about who</p>
<p>handles my horses. The road ain&#x27;t no place for you. You must be a</p>
<p>good man gone wrong. Just the same you can plow with my horses,</p>
<p>startin&#x27; in to-morrow mornin&#x27;.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Which shows how wise he wasn&#x27;t. I hadn&#x27;t showed I could plow.&quot;</p>
<p>When Saxon had served the beans, and Billy the coffee, she stood</p>
<p>still a moment and surveyed the spread meal on the blankets--the</p>
<p>canister of sugar, the condensed milk tin, the sliced corned</p>
<p>beef, the lettuce salad and sliced tomatoes, the slices of fresh</p>
<p>French bread, and the steaming plates of beans and mugs of</p>
<p>coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;What a difference from last night!&quot; Saxon exclaimed, clapping</p>
<p>her hands. &quot;It&#x27;s like an adventure out of a book. Oh, that boy I</p>
<p>went fishing with! Think of that beautiful table and that</p>
<p>beautiful house last night, and then look at this. Why, we could</p>
<p>have lived a thousand years on end in Oakland and never met a</p>
<p>woman like Mrs. Mortimer nor dreamed a house like hers existed.</p>
<p>And, Billy, just to think, we&#x27;ve only just started.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy worked for three days, and while insisting that he was</p>
<p>doing very well, he freely admitted that there was more in</p>
<p>plowing than he had thought. Saxon experienced quiet satisfaction</p>
<p>when she learned he was enjoying it.</p>
<p>&quot;I never thought I&#x27;d like plowin&#x27;--much,&quot; he observed. &quot;But it&#x27;s</p>
<p>fine. It&#x27;s good for the leg-muscles, too. They don&#x27;t get exercise</p>
<p>enough in teamin&#x27;. If ever I trained for another fight, you bet</p>
<p>I&#x27;d take a whack at plowin&#x27;. An&#x27;, you know, the ground has a</p>
<p>regular good smell to it, a-turnin&#x27; over an&#x27; turnin&#x27; over. Gosh,</p>
<p>it&#x27;s good enough to eat, that smell. An&#x27; it just goes on, turnin&#x27;</p>
<p>up an&#x27; over, fresh an&#x27; thick an&#x27; good, all day long. An&#x27; the</p>
<p>horses are Joe-dandies. They know their business as well as a</p>
<p>man. That&#x27;s one thing, Benson ain&#x27;t got a scrub horse on the</p>
<p>place.&quot;</p>
<p>The last day Billy worked, the sky clouded over, the air grew</p>
<p>damp, a strong wind began to blow from the southeast, and all the</p>
<p>signs were present of the first winter rain. Billy came back in</p>
<p>the evening with a small roll of old canvas he had borrowed,</p>
<p>which he proceeded to arrange over their bed on a framework so as</p>
<p>to shed rain. Several times he complained about the little finger</p>
<p>of his left hand. It had been bothering him all day he told</p>
<p>Saxon, for several days slightly, in fact, and it was as tender</p>
<p>as a boil--most likely a splinter, but he had been unable to</p>
<p>locate it.</p>
<p>He went ahead with storm preparations, elevating the bed on old</p>
<p>boards which he lugged from a disused barn falling to decay on</p>
<p>the opposite bank of the creek. Upon the boards he heaped dry</p>
<p>leaves for a mattress. He concluded by reinforcing the canvas</p>
<p>with additional guys of odd pieces of rope and bailing-wire.</p>
<p>When the first splashes of rain arrived Saxon was delighted.</p>
<p>Billy betrayed little interest. His finger was hurting too much,</p>
<p>he said. Neither he nor Saxon could make anything of it, and both</p>
<p>scoffed at the idea of a felon.</p>
<p>&quot;It might be a run-around,&quot; Saxon hazarded.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know. I remember Mrs. Cady had one once, but I was too</p>
<p>small. It was the little finger, too. She poulticed it, I think.</p>
<p>And I remember she dressed it with some kind of salve. It got</p>
<p>awful bad, and finished by her losing the nail. After that it got</p>
<p>well quick, and a new nail grew out. Suppose I make a hot bread</p>
<p>poultice for yours.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy declined, being of the opinion that it would be better in</p>
<p>the morning. Saxon was troubled, and as she dozed off she knew</p>
<p>that he was lying restlessly wide awake. A few minutes afterward,</p>
<p>roused by a heavy blast of wind and rain on the canvas, she heard</p>
<p>Billy softly groaning. She raised herself on her elbow and with</p>
<p>her free hand, in the way she knew, manipulating his forehead and</p>
<p>the surfaces around his eyes, soothed him off to sleep.</p>
<p>Again she slept. And again she was aroused, this time not by the</p>
<p>storm, but by Billy. She could not see, but by feeling she</p>
<p>ascertained his strange position. He was outside the blankets and</p>
<p>on his knees, his forehead resting on the boards, his shoulders</p>
<p>writhing with suppressed anguish.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s pulsin&#x27; to beat the band,&quot; he said, when she spoke. &quot;It&#x27;s</p>
<p>worsen a thousand toothaches. But it ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27;... if only</p>
<p>the canvas don&#x27;t blow down. Think what our folks had to stand,&quot;</p>
<p>he gritted out between groans. &quot;Why, my father was out in the</p>
<p>mountains, an&#x27; the man with &#x27;m got mauled by a grizzly--clean</p>
<p>clawed to the bones all over. An&#x27; they was outa grub an&#x27; had to</p>
<p>travel. Two times outa three, when my father put &#x27;m on the horse,</p>
<p>he&#x27;d faint away. Had to be tied on. An&#x27; that lasted five weeks,</p>
<p>an&#x27; HE pulled through. Then there was Jack Quigley. He blowed off</p>
<p>his whole right hand with the burstin&#x27; of his shotgun, an&#x27; the</p>
<p>huntin&#x27; dog pup he had with &#x27;m ate up three of the fingers. An&#x27;</p>
<p>he was all alone in the marsh, an&#x27;--&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon heard no more of the adventures of Jack Quigley. A</p>
<p>terrific blast of wind parted several of the guys, collapsed the</p>
<p>framework, and for a moment buried them under the canvas. The</p>
<p>next moment canvas, framework, and trailing guys were whisked</p>
<p>away into the darkness, and Saxon and Billy were deluged with</p>
<p>rain.</p>
<p>&quot;Only one thing to do,&quot; he yelled in her ear. &quot;--Gather up the</p>
<p>things an&#x27; get into that old barn.&quot;</p>
<p>They accomplished this in the drenching darkness, making two</p>
<p>trips across the stepping stones of the shallow creek and soaking</p>
<p>themselves to the knees. The old barn leaked like a sieve, but</p>
<p>they managed to find a dry space on which to spread their</p>
<p>anything but dry bedding. Billy&#x27;s pain was heart-rending to</p>
<p>Saxon. An hour was required to subdue him to a doze, and only by</p>
<p>continuously stroking his forehead could she keep him asleep.</p>
<p>Shivering and miserable, she accepted a night of wakefulness</p>
<p>gladly with the knowledge that she kept him from knowing the</p>
<p>worst of his pain.</p>
<p>At the time when she had decided it must be past midnight, there</p>
<p>was an interruption. From the open doorway came a flash of</p>
<p>electric light, like a tiny searchlight, which quested about the</p>
<p>barn and came to rest on her and Billy. From the source of light</p>
<p>a harsh voice said:</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! ha! I&#x27;ve got you! Come out of that!&quot;</p>
<p>Billy sat up, his eyes dazzled by the light. The voice behind the</p>
<p>light was approaching and reiterating its demand that they come</p>
<p>out of that.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s up?&quot; Billy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Me,&quot; was the answer; &quot;an&#x27; wide awake, you bet.&quot;</p>
<p>The voice was now beside them, scarcely a yard away, yet they</p>
<p>eoald see nothing on account of the light, which was</p>
<p>intermittent, frequently going out for an instant as the</p>
<p>operator&#x27;s thumb tired on the switch.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, get a move on,&quot; the voice went on. &quot;Roll up your</p>
<p>blankets an&#x27; trot along. I want you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who in hell are you?&quot; Billy demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m the constable. Come on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what do you want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You, of course, the pair of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vagrancy. Now hustle. I ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to loaf here all night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, chase yourself,&quot; Billy advised. &quot;I ain&#x27;t a vag. I&#x27;m a</p>
<p>workingman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you are an&#x27; maybe you ain&#x27;t,&quot; said the constable; &quot;but you</p>
<p>can tell all that to Judge Neusbaumer in the mornin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why you. .. you stinkin&#x27;, dirty cur, you think you&#x27;re goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>pull me,&quot; Billy began. &quot;Turn the light on yourself. I want to see</p>
<p>what kind of an ugly mug you got. Pull me, eh? Pull me? For two</p>
<p>cents I&#x27;d get up there an&#x27; beat you to a jelly, you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, Billy,&quot; Saxon pleaded. &quot;Don&#x27;t make trouble. It would</p>
<p>mean jail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right,&quot; the constable approved, &quot;listen to your woman.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s my wife, an&#x27; see you speak of her as such,&quot; Billy warned.</p>
<p>&quot;Now get out, if you know what&#x27;s good for yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve seen your kind before,&quot; the constable retorted. &quot;An&#x27; I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>got my little persuader with me. Take a squint.&quot;</p>
<p>The shaft of light shifted, and out of the darkness, illuminated</p>
<p>with ghastly brilliance, they saw thrust a hand holding a</p>
<p>revolver. This hand seemed a thing apart, self-existent, with no</p>
<p>corporeal attachment, and it appeared and disappeared like an</p>
<p>apparition as the thumb-pressure wavered on the switch. One</p>
<p>moment they were staring at the hand and revolver, the next</p>
<p>moment at impenetrable darkness, and the next moment again at the</p>
<p>hand and revolver.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, I guess you&#x27;ll come,&quot; the constable gloated.</p>
<p>&quot;You got another guess comin&#x27;,&quot; Billy began.</p>
<p>But at that moment the light went out. They heard a quick</p>
<p>movement on the officer&#x27;s part and the thud of the light-stick on</p>
<p>the ground. Both Billy and the constable fumbled for it, but</p>
<p>Billy found it and flashed it on the other. They saw a</p>
<p>gray-bearded man clad in streaming oilskins. He was an old man,</p>
<p>and reminded Saxon of the sort she had been used to see in Grand</p>
<p>Army processions on Decoration Day.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me that stick,&quot; he bullied.</p>
<p>Billy sneered a refusal.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;ll put a hole through you, by criminy.&quot;</p>
<p>He leveled the revolver directly at Billy, whose thumb on the</p>
<p>switch did not waver, and they could see the gleaming bullet-tips</p>
<p>in the chambers of the cylinder.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you whiskery old skunk, you ain&#x27;t got the grit to shoot</p>
<p>sour apples,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s answer. &quot;I know your kind--brave as</p>
<p>lions when it comes to pullin&#x27; miserable, broken-spirited bindle</p>
<p>stiffs, but as leery as a yellow dog when you face a man. Pull</p>
<p>that trigger! Why, you pusillanimous piece of dirt, you&#x27;d run</p>
<p>with your tail between your legs if I said boo!&quot;</p>
<p>Suiting action to the word, Billy let out an explosive &quot;BOO!&quot; and</p>
<p>Saxon giggled involuntarily at the startle it caused in the</p>
<p>constable.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll give you a last chance,&quot; the latter grated through his</p>
<p>teeth. &quot;Turn over that light-stick an&#x27; come along peaceable, or</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll lay you out.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was frightened for Billy&#x27;s sake, and yet only half</p>
<p>frightened. She had a faith that the man dared not fire, and she</p>
<p>felt the old familiar thrills of admiration for Billy&#x27;s courage.</p>
<p>She could not see his face, but she knew in all certitude that it</p>
<p>was bleak and passionless in the terrifying way she had seen it</p>
<p>when he fought the three Irishmen.</p>
<p>&quot;You ain&#x27;t the first man I killed,&quot; the constable threatened.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m an old soldier, an&#x27; I ain&#x27;t squeamish over blood--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you ought to be ashamed of yourself,&quot; Saxon broke in,</p>
<p>&quot;trying to shame and disgrace peaceable people who&#x27;ve done no</p>
<p>wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve done wrong sleepin&#x27; here,&quot; was his vindication. &quot;This</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t your property. It&#x27;s agin the law. An&#x27; folks that go agin</p>
<p>the law go to jail, as the two of you&#x27;ll go. I&#x27;ve sent many a</p>
<p>tramp up for thirty days for sleepin&#x27; in this very shack. Why,</p>
<p>it&#x27;s a regular trap for &#x27;em. I got a good glimpse of your faces</p>
<p>an&#x27; could see you was tough characters.&quot; He turned on Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve fooled enough with you. Are you goin&#x27; to give in an&#x27; come</p>
<p>peaceable?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to tell you a couple of things, old boss,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>answered. &quot;Number one: you ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to pull us. Number two:</p>
<p>we&#x27;re goin&#x27; to sleep the night out here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gimme that light-stick,&quot; the constable demanded peremptorily.</p>
<p>&quot;G&#x27;wan, Whiskers. You&#x27;re standin&#x27; on your foot. Beat it. Pull</p>
<p>your freight. As for your torch you&#x27;ll find it outside in the</p>
<p>mud.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy shifted the light until it illuminated the doorway, and</p>
<p>then threw the stick as he would pitch a baseball. They were now</p>
<p>in total darkness, and they could hear the intruder gritting his</p>
<p>teeth in rage.</p>
<p>&quot;Now start your shootin&#x27; an&#x27; see what&#x27;ll happen to you,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>advised menacingly.</p>
<p>Saxon felt for Billy&#x27;s hand and squeezed it proudly. The</p>
<p>constable grumbled some threat.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot; Billy demanded sharply. &quot;Ain&#x27;t you gone yet? Now</p>
<p>listen to me, Whiskers. I&#x27;ve put up with all your shenanigan I&#x27;m</p>
<p>goin&#x27; to. Now get out or I&#x27;ll throw you out. An&#x27; if you come</p>
<p>monkeyin, around here again you&#x27;ll get yours. Now get!&quot;</p>
<p>So great was the roar of the storm that they could hear nothing.</p>
<p>Billy rolled a cigarette. When he lighted it, they saw the barn</p>
<p>was empty. Billy chuckled.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, I was so mad I clean forgot my run-around. It&#x27;s only just</p>
<p>beginnin&#x27; to tune up again.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon made him lie down and receive her soothing ministrations.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no use moving till morning, &quot; she said. &quot;Then, just as</p>
<p>soon as it&#x27;s light, we&#x27;ll catch a car into San Jose, rent a</p>
<p>room, get a hot breakfast, and go to a drug store for the proper</p>
<p>stuff for poulticing or whatever treatment&#x27;s needed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Benson,&quot; Billy demurred.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll telephone him from town. It will only cost five cents. I</p>
<p>saw he had, a wire. And you couldn&#x27;t plow on account of the rain,</p>
<p>even if your finger was well. Besides, we&#x27;ll both be mending</p>
<p>together. My heel will be all right by the time it clears up and</p>
<p>we can start traveling.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
<p>Early on Monday morning, three days later, Saxon and Billy took</p>
<p>an electric car to the end of the line, and started a second time</p>
<p>for San Juan. Puddles were standing in the road, but the sun</p>
<p>shone from a blue sky, and everywhere, on the ground, was a faint</p>
<p>hint of budding green. At Benson&#x27;s Saxon waited while Billy went</p>
<p>in to get his six dollars for the three days&#x27; plowing.</p>
<p>&quot;Kicked like a steer because I was quittin&#x27;,&quot; he told her when he</p>
<p>came back. &quot;He wouldn&#x27;t listen at first. Said he&#x27;d put me to</p>
<p>drivin&#x27; in a few days, an&#x27; that there wasn&#x27;t enough good</p>
<p>four-horse men to let one go easily.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what did you say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I just told &#x27;m I had to be movin&#x27; along. An&#x27; when he tried</p>
<p>to argue I told &#x27;m my wife was with me, an&#x27; she was blamed</p>
<p>anxious to get along.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But so are you, Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, Pete; but just the same I wasn&#x27;t as keen as you. Doggone</p>
<p>it, I was gettin&#x27; to like that plowin&#x27;. I&#x27;ll never be scairt to</p>
<p>ask for a job at it again. I&#x27;ve got to where I savvy the burro,</p>
<p>an&#x27; you bet I can plow against most of &#x27;m right now.&quot;</p>
<p>An hour afterward, with a good three miles to their credit, they</p>
<p>edged to the side of the road at the sound of an automobile</p>
<p>behind them. But the machine did not pass. Benson was alone in</p>
<p>it, and he came to a stop alongside.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are you bound?&quot; he inquired of Billy, with a quick,</p>
<p>measuring glance at Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Monterey--if you&#x27;re goin&#x27; that far,&quot; Billy answered with a</p>
<p>chuckle.</p>
<p>&quot;I can give you a lift as far as Watsonville. It would take you</p>
<p>several days on shank&#x27;s mare with those loads. Climb in.&quot; He</p>
<p>addressed Saxon directly. &quot;Do you want to ride in front?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon glanced to Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; he approved. &quot;It&#x27;s fine in front.--This is my wife, Mr.</p>
<p>Benson--Mrs. Roberts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ho, so you&#x27;re the one that took your husband away from me,&quot;</p>
<p>Benson accused good humoredly, as he tucked the robe around her.</p>
<p>Saxon shouldered the responsibility and became absorbed in</p>
<p>watching him start the car.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d be a mighty poor farmer if I owned no more land than you&#x27;d</p>
<p>plowed before you came to me,&quot; Benson, with a twinkling eye,</p>
<p>jerked over his shoulder to Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d never had my hands on a plow but once before,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>confessed. &quot;But a fellow has to learn some time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At two dollars a day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he can get some alfalfa artist to put up for it,&quot; Billy met</p>
<p>him complacently.</p>
<p>Benson laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a quick learner,&quot; he complimented. &quot;I could see that you</p>
<p>and plows weren&#x27;t on speaking acquaintance. But you took hold</p>
<p>right. There isn&#x27;t one man in ten I could hire off the county</p>
<p>road that could do as well as you were doing on the third day.</p>
<p>But your big asset is that you know horses. It was half a joke</p>
<p>when I told you to take the lines that morning. You&#x27;re a trained</p>
<p>horseman and a born horseman as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s very gentle with horses,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>&quot;But there&#x27;s more than that to it,&quot; Benson took her up. &quot;Your</p>
<p>husband&#x27;s got the WAY with him. It&#x27;s hard to explain. But that&#x27;s</p>
<p>what it is--the WAY. It&#x27;s an instinct almost. Kindness is</p>
<p>necessary. But GRIP is more so. Your husband grips his horses.</p>
<p>Take the test I gave him with the four-horse load. It was too</p>
<p>complicated and severe. Kindness couldn&#x27;t have done it. It took</p>
<p>grip. I could see it the moment he started. There wasn&#x27;t any</p>
<p>doubt in his mind. There wasn&#x27;t any doubt in the horses. They got</p>
<p>the feel of him. They just knew the thing was going to be done</p>
<p>and that it was up to them to do it. They didn&#x27;t have any fear,</p>
<p>but just the same they knew the boss was in the seat. When he</p>
<p>took hold of those lines, he took hold of the horses. He gripped</p>
<p>them, don&#x27;t you see. He picked them up and put them where he</p>
<p>wanted them, swung them up and down and right and left, made</p>
<p>them pull, and slack, and back--and they knew everything was</p>
<p>going to come out right. Oh, horses may be stupid, but they&#x27;re</p>
<p>not altogether fools. They know when the proper horseman has hold</p>
<p>of them, though how they know it so quickly is beyond me.&quot;</p>
<p>Benson paused, half vexed at his volubility, and gazed keenly at</p>
<p>Saxon to see if she had followed him. What he saw in her face</p>
<p>and eyes satisfied him, and he added, with a short laugh:</p>
<p>&quot;Horseflesh is a hobby of mine. Don&#x27;t think otherwise because I</p>
<p>am running a stink engine. I&#x27;d rather be streaking along here</p>
<p>behind a pair of fast-steppers. But I&#x27;d lose time on them, and,</p>
<p>worse than that, I&#x27;d be too anxious about them all the time. As</p>
<p>for this thing, why, it has no nerves, no delicate joints nor</p>
<p>tendons; it&#x27;s a case of let her rip.&quot;</p>
<p>The miles flew past and Saxon was soon deep in talk with her</p>
<p>host. Here again, she discerned immediately, was a type of the</p>
<p>new farmer. The knowledge she had picked up enabled her to talk</p>
<p>to advantage, and when Benson talked she was amazed that she</p>
<p>could understand so much. In response to his direct querying, she</p>
<p>told him her and Billy&#x27;s plans, sketching the Oakland life</p>
<p>vaguely, and dwelling on their future intentions.</p>
<p>Almost as in a dream, when they passed the nurseries at Morgan</p>
<p>Hill, she learned they had come twenty miles, and realized that</p>
<p>it was a longer stretch than they had planned to walk that day.</p>
<p>And still the machine hummed on, eating up the distance as ever</p>
<p>it flashed into view.</p>
<p>&quot;I wondered what so good a man as your husband was doing on the</p>
<p>road,&quot; Benson told her.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; she smiled. &quot;He said you said he must be a good man gone</p>
<p>wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you see, I didn&#x27;t know about YOU. Now I understand. Though I</p>
<p>must say it&#x27;s extraordinary in these days for a young couple like</p>
<p>you to pack your blankets in search of land. And, before I forget</p>
<p>it, I want to tell you one thing.&quot; He turned to Billy. &quot;I am just</p>
<p>telling your wife that there&#x27;s an all-the-year job waiting for</p>
<p>you on my ranch. And there&#x27;s a tight little cottage of three</p>
<p>rooms the two of you can housekeep in. Don&#x27;t forget.&quot;</p>
<p>Among other things Saxon discovered that Benson had gone through</p>
<p>the College of Agriculture at the University of California--a</p>
<p>branch of learning she had not known existed. He gave her small</p>
<p>hope in her search for government land.</p>
<p>&quot;The only government land left,&quot; he informed her, &quot;is what is not</p>
<p>good enough to take up for one reason or another. If it&#x27;s good</p>
<p>land down there where you&#x27;re going, then the market is</p>
<p>inaccessible. I know no railroads tap in there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait till we strike Pajaro Valley,&quot; he said, when they had</p>
<p>passed Gilroy and were booming on toward Sargent&#x27;s. &quot;I&#x27;ll show</p>
<p>you what can be done with the soil--and not by cow-college</p>
<p>graduates but by uneducated foreigners that the high and mighty</p>
<p>American has always sneered at. I&#x27;ll show you. It&#x27;s one of the</p>
<p>most wonderful demonstrations in the state.&quot;</p>
<p>At Sargent&#x27;s he left them in the machine a few minutes while he</p>
<p>transacted business.</p>
<p>&quot;Whew! It beats hikin&#x27;,&quot; Billy said. &quot;The day&#x27;s young yet and</p>
<p>when he drops us we&#x27;ll be fresh for a few miles on our own. Just</p>
<p>the same, when we get settled an&#x27; well off, I guess I&#x27;ll stick by</p>
<p>horses. They&#x27;ll always be good enough for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A machine&#x27;s only good to get somewhere in a hurry,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>agreed. &quot;Of course, if we got very, very rich--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon,&quot; Billy broke in, suddenly struck with an idea. &quot;I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>learned one thing. I ain&#x27;t afraid any more of not gettin&#x27; work in</p>
<p>the country. I was at first, but I didn&#x27;t tell you. Just the same</p>
<p>I was dead leery when we pulled out on the San Leandro pike. An&#x27;</p>
<p>here, already, is two places open--Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s an&#x27; Benson&#x27;s;</p>
<p>an&#x27; steady jobs, too. Yep, a man can get work in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; Saxon amended, with a proud little smile, &quot;you haven&#x27;t said</p>
<p>it right. Any GOOD man can get work in the country. The big</p>
<p>farmers don&#x27;t hire men out of charity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure; they ain&#x27;t in it for their health,&quot; he grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;And they jump at you. That&#x27;s because you are a good man. They</p>
<p>can see it with half an eye. Why, Billy, take all the working</p>
<p>tramps we&#x27;ve met on the road already. There wasn&#x27;t one to compare</p>
<p>with you. I looked them over. They&#x27;re all weak--weak in their</p>
<p>bodies, weak in their heads, weak both ways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yep, they are a pretty measly bunch,&quot; Billy admitted modestly.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the wrong time of the year to see Pajaro Valley,&quot; Benson</p>
<p>said, when he again sat beside Saxon and Sargent&#x27;s was a thing of</p>
<p>the past. &quot;Just the same, it&#x27;s worth seeing any time. Think of</p>
<p>it--twelve thousand acres of apples! Do you know what they call</p>
<p>Pajaro Valley now? New Dalmatia. We&#x27;re being squeezed out. We</p>
<p>Yankees thought we were smart. Well, the Dalmatians came along</p>
<p>and showed they were smarter. They were miserable</p>
<p>immigrants--poorer than Job&#x27;s turkey. First, they worked at day&#x27;s</p>
<p>labor in the fruit harvest. Next they began, in a small way,</p>
<p>buying the apples on the trees. The more money they made the</p>
<p>bigger became their deals. Pretty soon they were renting the</p>
<p>orchards on long leases. And now, they are beginning to buy the</p>
<p>land. It won&#x27;t be long before they own the whole valley, and the</p>
<p>last American will be gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, our smart Yankees! Why, those first ragged Slavs in their</p>
<p>first little deals with us only made something like two and three</p>
<p>thousand per cent. profits. And now they&#x27;re satisfied to make a</p>
<p>hundred per cent. It&#x27;s a calamity if their profits sink to</p>
<p>twenty-five or fifty per cent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s like San Leandro,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;The original owners of the</p>
<p>land are about all gone already. It&#x27;s intensive cultivation.&quot; She</p>
<p>liked that phrase. &quot;It isn&#x27;t a ease of having a lot of acres, but</p>
<p>of how much they can get out of one acre.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and more than that,&quot; Benson answered, nodding his head</p>
<p>emphatically. &quot;Lots of them, like Luke Scurich, are in it on a</p>
<p>large scale. Several of them are worth a quarter of a million</p>
<p>already. I know ten of them who will average one hundred and</p>
<p>fifty thousand each. They have a WAY with apples. It&#x27;s almost a</p>
<p>gift. They KNOW trees in much the same way your husband knows</p>
<p>horses. Each tree is just as much an individual to them as a</p>
<p>horse is to me. They know each tree, its whole history,</p>
<p>everything that ever happened to it, its every idiosyncrasy. They</p>
<p>have their fingers on its pulse. They can tell if it&#x27;s feeling as</p>
<p>well to-day as it felt yesterday. And if it isn&#x27;t, they know why</p>
<p>and proceed to remedy matters for it. They can look at a tree in</p>
<p>bloom and tell how many boxes of apples it will pack, and not</p>
<p>only that--they&#x27;ll know. what the quality and grades of those</p>
<p>apples are going to be. Why, they know each individual apple, and</p>
<p>they pick it tenderly, with love, never hurting it, and pack it</p>
<p>and ship it tenderly and with love, and when it arrives at</p>
<p>market, it isn&#x27;t bruised nor rotten, and it fetches top price.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it&#x27;s more than intensive. These Adriatic Slavs are</p>
<p>long-headed in business. Not only can they grow apples, but they</p>
<p>can sell apples. No market? What does it matter? Make a market.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s their way, while our kind let the crops rot knee-deep</p>
<p>under the trees. Look at Peter Mengol. Every year he goes to</p>
<p>England, and he takes a hundred carloads of yellow Newton pippins</p>
<p>with him. Why, those Dalmatians are showing Pajaro apples on the</p>
<p>South African market right now, and coining money out of it hand</p>
<p>over fist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do they do with all the money?&quot; Saxon queried.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy the Americans of Pajaro Valley out, of course, as they are</p>
<p>already doing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then?&quot; she questioned.</p>
<p>Benson looked at her quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;Then they&#x27;ll start buying the Americans out of some other</p>
<p>valley. And the Americans will spend the money and by the second</p>
<p>generation start rotting in the cities, as you and your husband</p>
<p>would have rotted if you hadn&#x27;t got out.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon could not repress a shudder.--As Mary had rotted, she</p>
<p>thought; as Bert and all the rest had rotted; as Tom and all the</p>
<p>rest were rotting.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s a great country,&quot; Benson was continuing. &quot;But we&#x27;re not</p>
<p>a great people. Kipling is right. We&#x27;re crowded out and sitting</p>
<p>on the stoop. And the worst of it is there&#x27;s no reason we</p>
<p>shouldn&#x27;t know better. We&#x27;re teaching it in all our agricultural</p>
<p>colleges, experiment stations, and demonstration trains. But the</p>
<p>people won&#x27;t take hold, and the immigrant, who has learned in a</p>
<p>hard school, beats them out. Why, after I graduated, and before</p>
<p>my father died--he was of the old school and laughed at what he</p>
<p>called my theories--I traveled for a couple of years. I wanted to</p>
<p>see how the old countries farmed. Oh, I saw.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll soon enter the valley. You bet I saw. First thing, in</p>
<p>Japan, the terraced hillsides. Take a hill so steep you couldn&#x27;t</p>
<p>drive a horse up it. No bother to them. They terraced it--a stone</p>
<p>wall, and good masonry, six feet high, a level terrace six feet</p>
<p>wide; up and up, walls and terraces, the same thing all the way,</p>
<p>straight into the air, walls upon walls, terraces upon terraces,</p>
<p>until I&#x27;ve seen ten-foot walls built to make three-foot terraces,</p>
<p>and twenty-foot walls for four or five feet of soil they could</p>
<p>grow things on. And that soil, packed up the mountainsides in</p>
<p>baskets on their backs!</p>
<p>&quot;Same thing everywhere I went, in Greece, in Ireland, in</p>
<p>Dalmatia--I went there, too. They went around and gathered every</p>
<p>bit of soil they could find, gleaned it and even stole it by the</p>
<p>shovelful or handful, and carried it up the mountains on their</p>
<p>backs and built farms--BUILT them, MADE them, on the naked rock.</p>
<p>Why, in France, I&#x27;ve seen hill peasants mining their stream-beds</p>
<p>for soil as our fathers mined the streams of California for gold.</p>
<p>Only our gold&#x27;s gone, and the peasants&#x27; soil remains, turning</p>
<p>over and over, doing something, growing something, all the time.</p>
<p>Now, I guess I&#x27;ll hush.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My God!&quot; Billy muttered in awe-stricken tones. &quot;Our folks never</p>
<p>done that. No wonder they lost out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s the valley now,&quot; Benson said. &quot;Look at those trees! Look</p>
<p>at those hillsides! That&#x27;s New Dalmatia. Look at it! An apple</p>
<p>paradise! Look at that soil! Look at the way it&#x27;s worked!&quot;</p>
<p>It was not a large valley that Saxon saw. But everywhere, across</p>
<p>the flat-lands and up the low rolling hills, the industry of the</p>
<p>Dalmatians was evident. As she looked she listened to Benson.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know what the old settlers did with this beautiful soil?</p>
<p>Planted the flats in grain and pastured cattle on the hills. And</p>
<p>now twelve thousand acres of it are in apples. It&#x27;s a regular</p>
<p>show place for the Eastern guests at Del Monte, who run out here</p>
<p>in their machines to see the trees in bloom or fruit. Take Matteo</p>
<p>Lettunich--he&#x27;s one of the originals. Entered through Castle</p>
<p>Garden and became a dish-washer. When he laid eyes on this</p>
<p>valley he knew it was his Klondike. To-day he leases seven</p>
<p>hundred acres and owns a hundred and thirty of his own--the</p>
<p>finest orchard in the valley, and he packs from forty to fifty</p>
<p>thousand boxes of export apples from it every year. And he won&#x27;t</p>
<p>let a soul but a Dalmatian pick a single apple of all those</p>
<p>apples. One day, in a banter, I asked him what he&#x27;d sell his</p>
<p>hundred and thirty acres for. He answered seriously. He told me</p>
<p>what it had netted him, year by year, and struck an average. He</p>
<p>told me to calculate the principal from that at six per cent. I</p>
<p>did. It came to over three thousand dollars an acre.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are all the Chinks doin&#x27; in the Valley?&quot; Billy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Growin&#x27; apples, too?&quot;</p>
<p>Benson shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;But that&#x27;s another point where we Americans lose out. There</p>
<p>isn&#x27;t anything wasted in this valley, not a core nor a paring;</p>
<p>and it isn&#x27;t the Americans who do the saving. There are</p>
<p>fifty-seven apple-evaporating furnaces, to say nothing of the</p>
<p>apple canneries and cider and vinegar factories. And Mr. John</p>
<p>Chinaman owns them. They ship fifteen thousand barrels of cider</p>
<p>and vinegar each year.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was our folks that made this country,&quot; Billy reflected.</p>
<p>&quot;Fought for it, opened it up, did everything--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But develop it,&quot; Benson caught him up. &quot;We did our best to</p>
<p>destroy it, as we destroyed the soil of New England.&quot; He waved</p>
<p>his hand, indicating some place beyond the hills. &quot;Salinas lies</p>
<p>over that way. If you went through there you&#x27;d think you were in</p>
<p>Japan. And more than one fat little fruit valley in California</p>
<p>has been taken over by the Japanese. Their method is somewhat</p>
<p>different from the Dalmatians&#x27;. First they drift in fruit picking</p>
<p>at day&#x27;s wages. They give better satisfaction than the American</p>
<p>fruit-pickers, too, and the Yankee grower is glad to get them.</p>
<p>Next, as they get stronger, they form in Japanese unions and</p>
<p>proceed to run the American labor out. Still the fruit-growers</p>
<p>are satisfied. The next step is when the Japs won&#x27;t pick. The</p>
<p>American labor is gone. The fruit-grower is helpless. The crop</p>
<p>perishes. Then in step the Jap labor bosses. They&#x27;re the masters</p>
<p>already. They contract for the crop. The fruit-growers are at</p>
<p>their mercy, you see. Pretty soon the Japs are running the</p>
<p>valley. The fruit-growers have become absentee landlords and are</p>
<p>busy learning higher standards of living in the cities or making</p>
<p>trips to Europe. Remains only one more step. The Japs buy them</p>
<p>out. They&#x27;ve got to sell, for the Japs control the labor market</p>
<p>and could bankrupt them at will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But if this goes on, what is left for us?&quot; asked Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;What is happening. Those of us who haven&#x27;t anything rot in the</p>
<p>cities. Those of us who have land, sell it and go to the cities.</p>
<p>Some become larger capitalists; some go into the professions; the</p>
<p>rest spend the money and start rotting when it&#x27;s gone, and if it</p>
<p>lasts their life-time their children do the rotting for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Their long ride was soon over, and at parting Benson reminded</p>
<p>Billy of the steady job that awaited him any time he gave the</p>
<p>word.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess we&#x27;ll take a peep at that government land first,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>answered. &quot;Don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;ll settle down to, but there&#x27;s one</p>
<p>thing sure we won&#x27;t tackle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Start in apple-growin&#x27; at three thousan&#x27; dollars an acre.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy and Saxon, their packs upon the* backs, trudged along a</p>
<p>hundred yards. He was the first to break silence.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I tell you another thing, Saxon. We&#x27;ll never be goin&#x27; around</p>
<p>smellin&#x27; out an&#x27; swipin&#x27; bits of soil an&#x27; carryin&#x27; it up a hill</p>
<p>in a basket. The United States is big yet. I don&#x27;t care what</p>
<p>Benson or any of &#x27;em says, the United States ain&#x27;t played out.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s millions of acres untouched an&#x27; waitin&#x27;, an&#x27; it&#x27;s up to</p>
<p>us to find &#x27;em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#x27;ll tell you one thing,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;We&#x27;re getting an</p>
<p>education. Tom was raised on a ranch, yet he doesn&#x27;t know right</p>
<p>now as much about farming conditions as we do. And I&#x27;ll tell you</p>
<p>another thing. The more I think of it, the more it seems we are</p>
<p>going to be disappointed about that government land.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t no use believin&#x27; what everybody tells you,&quot; he protested.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it isn&#x27;t that. It&#x27;s what I think. I leave it to you. If this</p>
<p>land around here is worth three thousand an acre, why is it that</p>
<p>government land, if it&#x27;s any good, is waiting there, only a short</p>
<p>way off, to be taken for the asking.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy pondered this for a quarter of a mile, but could come to no</p>
<p>conclusion. At last he cleared his throat and remarked:</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we can wait till we see it first, can&#x27;t we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; Saxon agreed. &quot;We&#x27;ll wait till we see it.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
<p>They had taken the direct county road across the hills from</p>
<p>Monterey, instead of the Seventeen Mile Drive around by the</p>
<p>coast, so that Carmel Bay came upon them without any</p>
<p>fore-glimmerings of its beauty. Dropping down through the pungent</p>
<p>pines, they passed woods-embowered cottages, quaint and rustic,</p>
<p>of artists and writers, and went on across wind-blown rolling</p>
<p>sandhills held to place by sturdy lupine and nodding with pale</p>
<p>California poppies. Saxon screamed in sudden wonder of delight,</p>
<p>then caught her breath and gazed at the amazing peacock-blue of a</p>
<p>breaker, shot through with golden sunlight, overfalling in a</p>
<p>mile-long sweep and thundering into white ruin of foam on a</p>
<p>crescent beach of sand scarcely less white.</p>
<p>How long they stood and watched the stately procession of</p>
<p>breakers, rising from out the deep and wind-capped sea to froth</p>
<p>and thunder at their feet, Saxon did not know. She was recalled</p>
<p>to herself when Billy, laughing, tried to remove the telescope</p>
<p>basket from her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;You kind of look as though you was goin&#x27; to stop a while,&quot; he</p>
<p>said. &quot;So we might as well get comfortable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never dreamed it, I never dreamed it,&quot; she repeated, with</p>
<p>passionately clasped hands. &quot;I. .. I thought the surf at the</p>
<p>Cliff House was wonderful, but it gave no idea of this.--Oh!</p>
<p>Look! LOOK! Did you ever see such an unspeakable color? And the</p>
<p>sunlight flashing right through it! Oh! Oh! Oh!&quot;</p>
<p>At last she was able to take her eyes from the surf and gaze at</p>
<p>the sea-horizon of deepest peacock-blue and piled with</p>
<p>cloud-masses, at the curve of the beach south to the jagged point</p>
<p>of rocks, and at the rugged blue mountains seen across soft low</p>
<p>hills, landward, up Carmel Valley.</p>
<p>&quot;Might as well sit down an&#x27; take it easy,&quot; Billy indulged her.</p>
<p>&quot;This is too good to want to run away from all at once.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon assented, but began immediately to unlace her shoes.</p>
<p>&quot;You ain&#x27;t a-goin&#x27; to?&quot; Billy asked in surprised delight, then</p>
<p>began unlacing his own.</p>
<p>But before they were ready to run barefooted on the perilous</p>
<p>fringe of cream-wet sand where land and ocean met, a new and</p>
<p>wonderful thing attracted their attention. Down from the dark</p>
<p>pines and across the sandhills ran a man, naked save for narrow</p>
<p>trunks. He was smooth and rosy-skinned, cherubic-faced, with a</p>
<p>thatch of curly yellow hair, but his body was hugely thewed as a</p>
<p>Hercules&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!--must be Sandow, &quot; Billy muttered low to Saxon.</p>
<p>But she was thinking of the engraving in her mother&#x27;s scrapbook</p>
<p>and of the Vikings on the wet sands of England.</p>
<p>The runner passed them a dozen feet away, crossed the wet sand,</p>
<p>never parsing, till the froth wash was to his knees while above</p>
<p>him, ten feet at least, upreared a was of overtopping water. Huge</p>
<p>and powerful as his body had seemed, it was now white and fragile</p>
<p>in the face of that imminent, great-handed buffet of the sea.</p>
<p>Saxon gasped with anxiety, and she stole a look at Billy to note</p>
<p>that he was tense with watching.</p>
<p>But the stranger sprang to meet the blow, and, just when it</p>
<p>seemed he must be crushed, he dived into the face of the breaker</p>
<p>and disappeared. The mighty mass of water fell in thunder on the</p>
<p>beach, but beyond appeared a yellow head, one arm out-reaching,</p>
<p>and a portion of a shoulder. Only a few strokes was he able to</p>
<p>make are he was come pelted to dye through another breaker. This</p>
<p>was the battle--to win seaward against the Creep of the shoreward</p>
<p>hastening sea. Each time he dived and was lost to view Saxon</p>
<p>caught her breath and clenched her hands. Sometimes, after the</p>
<p>passage of a breaker, they enfold not find him, and when they did</p>
<p>he would be scores of feet away, flung there like a chip by a</p>
<p>smoke-bearded breaker. Often it seemed he must fail and be thrown</p>
<p>upon the beach, but at the end of half an hour he was beyond the</p>
<p>outer edge of the surf and swimming strong, no longer diving, but</p>
<p>topping the waves. Soon he was so far away that only at intervals</p>
<p>could they find the speck of him. That, too, vanished, and Saxon</p>
<p>and Billy looked at each other, she with amazement at the</p>
<p>swimmer&#x27;s valor, Billy with blue eyes flashing.</p>
<p>&quot;Some swimmer, that boy, some swimmer,&quot; he praised. &quot;Nothing</p>
<p>chicken-hearted about him.--Say, I only know tank-swimmin&#x27;, an&#x27;</p>
<p>bay-swimmin&#x27;, but now I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to learn ocean-swimmin&#x27;. If I</p>
<p>could do that I&#x27;d be so proud you couldn&#x27;t come within forty feet</p>
<p>of me. Why, Saxon, honest to God, I&#x27;d sooner do what he done than</p>
<p>own a thousan&#x27; farms. Oh, I can swim, too, I&#x27;m tellin&#x27; you,like a</p>
<p>fish--I swum, one Sunday, from the Narrow Gauge Pier to Sessions&#x27;</p>
<p>Basin, an&#x27; that&#x27;s miles--but I never seen anything like that guy</p>
<p>in the swimmin&#x27; line. An&#x27; I&#x27;m not goin&#x27; to leave this beach until</p>
<p>he comes back.--All by his lonely out there in a mountain sea,</p>
<p>think of it! He&#x27;s got his nerve all right, all right.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon and Billy ran barefooted up and down the beach, pursuing</p>
<p>each other with brandished snakes of seaweed and playing like</p>
<p>children for an hour. It was not until they were putting on their</p>
<p>shoes that they sighted the yellow head bearing shoreward. Billy</p>
<p>was at the edge of the surf to meet him, emerging, not</p>
<p>white-skinned as he had entered, but red from the pounding he had</p>
<p>received at the hands of the sea.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a wonder, and I just got to hand it to you,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>greeted him in outspoken admiration.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a big surf to-day,&quot; the young man replied, with a nod of</p>
<p>acknowledgment.</p>
<p>&quot;It don&#x27;t happen that you are a fighter I never heard of?&quot; Billy</p>
<p>queried, striving to get some inkling of the identity of the</p>
<p>physical prodigy.</p>
<p>The other laughed and shook his head, and Billy could</p>
<p>not guess that he was an ex-captain of a &#x27;Varsity Eleven, and</p>
<p>incidentally the father of a family and the author of many books.</p>
<p>He looked Billy over with an eye trained in measuring freshmen</p>
<p>aspirants for the gridiron.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re some body of a man,&quot; he appreciated. &quot;You&#x27;d strip with</p>
<p>the best of them. Am I right in guessing that you know your way</p>
<p>about in the ring?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy nodded. &quot;My name&#x27;s Roberts.&quot;</p>
<p>The swimmer scowled with a futile effort at recollection.</p>
<p>&quot;Bill--Bill Roberts,&quot; Billy supplemented.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, ho!--Not BIG Bill Roberts? Why, I saw you fight, before the</p>
<p>earthquake, in the Mechanic&#x27;s Pavilion. It was a preliminary to</p>
<p>Eddie Hanlon and some other fellow. You&#x27;re a two-handed fighter,</p>
<p>I remember that, with an awful wallop, but slow. Yes, I remember,</p>
<p>you were slow that night, but you got your man.&quot; He put out a wet</p>
<p>hand. &quot;My name&#x27;s Hazard-- Jim Hazard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; if you&#x27;re the football coach that was, a couple of years</p>
<p>ago, I&#x27;ve read about you in the papers. Am I right?&quot;</p>
<p>They shook hands heartily, and Saxon was introduced. She felt</p>
<p>very small beside the two young giants, and very proud,</p>
<p>withal, that she belonged to the race that gave them birth. She</p>
<p>could only listen to them talk.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d like to put on the gloves with you every day for half an</p>
<p>hour,&quot; Hazard said. &quot;You could teach me a lot. Are you going to</p>
<p>stay around here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. We&#x27;re goin&#x27; on down the coast, lookin&#x27; for land. Just the</p>
<p>same, I could teach you a few, and there&#x27;s one thing you could</p>
<p>teach me--surf swimmin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll swap lessons with you any time,&quot; Hazard offered. He turned</p>
<p>to Saxon. &quot;Why don&#x27;t you stop in Carmel for a while, It isn&#x27;t so</p>
<p>bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful,&quot; she acknowledged, with a grateful smile,</p>
<p>&quot;but--&quot; She turned and pointed to their packs on the edge of the</p>
<p>lupine. &quot;We&#x27;re on the tramp, and lookin&#x27; for government land.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#x27;re looking down past the Sur for it, it will keep,&quot; he</p>
<p>laughed. &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve got to run along and get some clothes on. If</p>
<p>you come back this way, look me up. Anybody will tell you where I</p>
<p>live. So long.&quot;</p>
<p>And, as he had first arrived, he departed, crossing the sandhills</p>
<p>on the run.</p>
<p>Billy followed him with admiring eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Some boy, some boy,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Why, Saxon, he&#x27;s famous. If</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen his face in the papers once, I&#x27;ve seen it a thousand</p>
<p>times. An&#x27; he ain&#x27;t a bit stuck on himself. Just man to man.</p>
<p>Say!--I&#x27;m beginnin&#x27; to have faith in the old stock again.&quot;</p>
<p>They turned their backs on the beach and in the tiny main street</p>
<p>bought meat, vegetables, and half a dozen eggs. Billy had to drag</p>
<p>Saxon away from the window of a fascinating shop where were</p>
<p>iridescent pearls of abalone, set and unset.</p>
<p>&quot;Abalones grow here, all along the coast,&quot; Billy assured her;</p>
<p>&quot;an&#x27; I&#x27;ll get you all you want. Low tide&#x27;s the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My father had a set of cuff-buttons made of abalone shell,&quot; she</p>
<p>said. &quot;They were set in pure, soft gold. I haven&#x27;t thought about</p>
<p>them for years, and I wonder who has them now.&quot;</p>
<p>They turned south. Everywhere from among the pines peeped the</p>
<p>quaint pretty houses of the artist folk, and they were not</p>
<p>prepared, where the road dipped to Carmel River, for the building</p>
<p>that met their eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I know what it is,&quot; Saxon almost whispered. &quot;It&#x27;s an old Spanish</p>
<p>Mission. It&#x27;s the Carmel Mission, of course. That&#x27;s the way the</p>
<p>Spaniards came up from Mexico, building missions as they came and</p>
<p>converting the Indians&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Until we chased them out, Spaniards an&#x27; Indians, whole kit an&#x27;</p>
<p>caboodle,&quot; Billy observed with calm satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same, it&#x27;s wonderful,&quot; Saxon mused, gazing at the big,</p>
<p>half-ruined adobe structure. &quot;There is the Mission Dolores, in</p>
<p>San Francisco, but it&#x27;s smaller than this and not as old.&quot;</p>
<p>Hidden from the sea by low hillocks, forsaken by human being and</p>
<p>human habitation, the church of sun-baked clay and straw and</p>
<p>chalk-rock stood hushed and breathless in the midst of the adobe</p>
<p>ruins which once had housed its worshiping thousands. The spirit</p>
<p>of the place descended upon Saxon and Billy, and they walked</p>
<p>softly, speaking in whispers, almost afraid to go in through the</p>
<p>open ports. There was neither priest nor worshiper, yet they</p>
<p>found all the evidences of use, by a congregation which Billy</p>
<p>judged must be small from the number of the benches. Inter they</p>
<p>climbed the earthquake~racked belfry, noting the hand-hewn</p>
<p>timbers; and in the gallery, discovering the pure quality of</p>
<p>their voices, Saxon, trembling at her own temerity, softly sang</p>
<p>the opening bars of &quot;Jesus Lover of My Soul.&quot; Delighted with the</p>
<p>result, she leaned over the railing, gradually increasing her</p>
<p>voice to its full strength as she sang:</p>
<p>&quot;Jesus, Lover of my soul,</p>
<p>Let me to Thy bosom fly,</p>
<p>While the nearer waters roll,</p>
<p>While the tempest still is nigh.</p>
<p>Hide me, O my Saviour, hide,</p>
<p>Till the storm of life is past;</p>
<p>Safe into the haven guide</p>
<p>And receive my soul at last.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy leaned against the ancient wall and loved her with his</p>
<p>eyes, and, when she had finished, he murmured, almost in a</p>
<p>whisper:</p>
<p>&quot;That was beautiful--just beautiful. An&#x27; you ought to a-seen your</p>
<p>face when you sang. It was as beautiful as your voice. Ain&#x27;t it</p>
<p>funny?--I never think of religion except when I think of you.&quot;</p>
<p>They camped in the willow bottom, cooked dinner, and spent the</p>
<p>afternoon on the point of low rocks north of the mouth of the</p>
<p>river. They had not intended to spend the afternoon, but found</p>
<p>themselves too fascinated to turn away from the breakers bursting</p>
<p>upon the rocks and from the many kinds of colorful sea life</p>
<p>starfish, crabs, mussels, sea anemones, and, once, in a</p>
<p>rock-pool, a small devilfish that chilled their blood when it</p>
<p>cast the hooded net of its body around the small crabs they</p>
<p>tossed to it. As the tide grew lower, they gathered a mess of</p>
<p>mussels--huge fellows, five and six inches long and bearded like</p>
<p>patriarchs. Then, while Billy wandered in a vain search for</p>
<p>abalones, Saxon lay and dabbled in the crystal-clear water of a</p>
<p>roak-pool, dipping up handfuls of glistening jewels--ground bits</p>
<p>of shell and pebble of flashing rose and blue and green and</p>
<p>violet. Billy came back and lay beside her, lazying in the</p>
<p>sea-cool sunshine, and together they watched the sun sink into</p>
<p>the horizon where the ocean was deepest peacock-blue.</p>
<p>She reached out her hand to Billy&#x27;s and sighed with sheer</p>
<p>repletion of content. It seemed she had never lived such a</p>
<p>wonderful day. It was as if all old dreams were coming true. Such</p>
<p>beauty of the world she had never guessed in her fondest</p>
<p>imagining. Billy pressed her hand tenderly.</p>
<p>&quot;What was you thinkin&#x27; of?&quot; he asked, as they arose finally to</p>
<p>go.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know, Billy. Perhaps that it was better, one day</p>
<p>like this, than ten thousand years in Oakland.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
<p>They left Carme1 River and Carmel Valley behind, and with a</p>
<p>rising sun went south across the hills between the mountains and</p>
<p>the sea. The road was badly washed and gullied and showed little</p>
<p>sign of travel.</p>
<p>&quot;It peters out altogether farther down,&quot; Billy said. &quot;From there</p>
<p>on it&#x27;s only horse trails. But I don&#x27;t see much signs of timber,</p>
<p>an&#x27; this soil&#x27;s none so good. It&#x27;s only used for pasture--no</p>
<p>farmin&#x27; to speak of.&quot;</p>
<p>The hills were bare and grassy. Only the canyons were wooded,</p>
<p>while the higher and more distant hills were furry with</p>
<p>chaparral. Once they saw a coyote slide into the brush, and</p>
<p>once Billy wished for a gun when a large wildcat stared at</p>
<p>them malignantly and declined to run until routed by a clod of</p>
<p>earth that burst about its ears like shrapnel.</p>
<p>Several miles along Saxon complained of thirst. Where the road</p>
<p>dipped nearly at sea level to cross a small gulch Billy looked</p>
<p>for water. The bed of the gulch was damp with hill-drip, and he</p>
<p>left her to rest while he sought a spring.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; he hailed a few minutes afterward. &quot;Come on down. You just</p>
<p>gotta see this. It&#x27;ll &#x27;most take your breath away.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon followed the faint path that led steeply down through the</p>
<p>thicket. Midway along, where a barbed wire fence was strung high</p>
<p>across the mouth of the gulch and weighted down with big rocks,</p>
<p>she caught her first glimpse of the tiny beach. Only from the sea</p>
<p>could one guess its existence, so completely was it tucked away</p>
<p>on three precipitous sides by the land, and screened by the</p>
<p>thicket. Furthermore, the beach was the head of a narrow rock</p>
<p>cove, a quarter of a mile long, up which pent way the sea roared</p>
<p>and was subdued at the last to a gentle pulse of surf. Beyond the</p>
<p>mouth many detached rocks, meeting the full force of the</p>
<p>breakers, spouted foam and spray high in the air. The knees of</p>
<p>these rocks, seen between the surges, were black with mussels. On</p>
<p>their tops sprawled huge sea-lions tawny-wet and roaring in the</p>
<p>sun, while overhead, uttering shrill cries, darted and wheeled a</p>
<p>multitude of sea birds.</p>
<p>The last of the descent, from the barbed wire fence, was a</p>
<p>sliding fall of a dozen feet, and Saxon arrived on the soft dry</p>
<p>sand in a sitting posture.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I tell you it&#x27;s just great,&quot; Billy bubbled. &quot;Look at it for</p>
<p>a camping spot. In among the trees there is the prettiest spring</p>
<p>you ever saw. An&#x27; look at all the good firewood, an&#x27;. ..&quot; He</p>
<p>gazed about and seaward with eyes that saw what no rush of words</p>
<p>could compass. &quot;... An&#x27;, an&#x27; everything. We could live here.</p>
<p>Look at the mussels out there. An&#x27; I bet you we could catch fish.</p>
<p>What d&#x27;ye say we stop a few days?--It&#x27;s vacation anyway--an&#x27; I</p>
<p>could go back to Carmel for hooks an&#x27; lines.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon, keenly appraising his glowing face, realized that he was</p>
<p>indeed being won from the city.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; there ain&#x27;t no wind here,&quot; he was recommending. &quot;Not a</p>
<p>breath. An&#x27; look how wild it is. Just as if we was a thousand</p>
<p>miles from anywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>The wind, which had been fresh and raw across the bare hills,</p>
<p>gained no entrance to the cove; and the beach was warm and balmy,</p>
<p>the air sweetly pungent with the thicket odors. Here and there,</p>
<p>in the midst of the thicket, severe small oak trees and other</p>
<p>small trees of which Saxon did not know the names. Her enthusiasm</p>
<p>now vied with Billy&#x27;s, and, hand in hand, they started to</p>
<p>explore.</p>
<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s where we can play real Robinson Crusoe, &quot; Billy</p>
<p>cried, as they crossed the hard sand from highwater mark to the</p>
<p>edge of the water. &quot;Come on, Robinson. Let&#x27;s stop over. Of</p>
<p>course, I&#x27;m your Man Friday, an&#x27; what you say goes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what shall we do with Man Saturday!&quot; She pointed in mock</p>
<p>consternation to a fresh footprint in the sand. &quot;He may be a</p>
<p>savage cannibal, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No chance. It&#x27;s not a bare foot but a tennis shoe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But a savage could get a tennis shoe from a drowned or eaten</p>
<p>sailor, couldn&#x27;t hey&quot; she contended.</p>
<p>&quot;But sailors don&#x27;t wear tennis shoes,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s prompt</p>
<p>refutation.</p>
<p>&quot;You know too much for Man Friday,&quot; she chided; &quot;but, just the</p>
<p>same; if you&#x27;ll fetch the packs we&#x27;ll make camp. Besides, it</p>
<p>mightn&#x27;t have been a sailor that was eaten. It might have been a</p>
<p>passenger.&quot;</p>
<p>By the end of an hour a snug camp was completed. The blankets</p>
<p>were spread, a supply of firewood was chopped from the seasoned</p>
<p>driftwood, and over a fire the coffee pot had begun to sing.</p>
<p>Saxon called to Billy, who was improvising a table from a</p>
<p>wave-washed plank. She pointed seaward. On the far point of</p>
<p>rocks, naked except for swimming trunks, stood a man. He was</p>
<p>gazing toward them, and they could see his long mop of dark hair</p>
<p>blown by the wind. As he started to climb the rocks landward</p>
<p>Billy eaUed Saxon&#x27;s attention to the fact that the stranger wore</p>
<p>tennis shoes. In a few minutes he dropped down from the rock to</p>
<p>the beach and walked up to them.</p>
<p>&quot;Gosh!&quot; Billy whispered to Saxon. &quot;He&#x27;s lean enough, but look at</p>
<p>his muscles. Everybody down here seems to go in for physical</p>
<p>culture.&quot;</p>
<p>As the newcomer approached, Saxon glimpsed sufflcient of his face</p>
<p>to be reminded of the old pioneers and of a certain type of face</p>
<p>seen frequently among the old soldiers: Young though he was--not</p>
<p>more than thirty, she decided--this man had the same long and</p>
<p>narrow face, with the high cheekbones, high and slender forehead,</p>
<p>and nose high, lean, and almost beaked. The lips were thin and</p>
<p>sensitive; but the eyes were different from any she had ever seen</p>
<p>in pioneer or veteran or any man. They were so dark a gray that</p>
<p>they seemed brown, and there were a farness and alertness of</p>
<p>vision in them as of bright questing through profounds of space.</p>
<p>In a misty way Saxon felt that she had seen him before.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello,&quot; he greeted. &quot;You ought to be comfortable here.&quot; He threw</p>
<p>down a partly filled sack. &quot;Mussels. All I could get. The tide&#x27;s</p>
<p>not low enough yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon heard Billy muffle an ejaculation, and saw painted on his</p>
<p>face the extremest astonishment.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, honest to God, it does me proud to meet you,&quot; he blurted</p>
<p>out. &quot;Shake hands. I always said if I laid eyes on you I&#x27;d</p>
<p>shake.--Say!&quot;</p>
<p>But Billy&#x27;s feelings mastered him, and, beginning with a choking</p>
<p>giggle, he roared into helpless mirth.</p>
<p>The stranger looked at him curiously across their clasped hands,</p>
<p>and glanced inquiringly to Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;You gotta excuse me,&quot; Billy gurgled, pumping the other&#x27;s hand up</p>
<p>and down. &quot;But I just gotta laugh. Why, honest to God, I&#x27;ve woke</p>
<p>up nights an&#x27; laughed an&#x27; gone to sleep again. Don&#x27;t you</p>
<p>recognize &#x27;m, Saxon? He&#x27;s the same identical dude say, friend,</p>
<p>you&#x27;re some punkins at a hundred yards dash, ain&#x27;t you7&quot;</p>
<p>And then, in a sudden rush, Saxon placed him. He it was who had</p>
<p>stood with Roy Blanchard alongside the automobile on the day she</p>
<p>had wandered, sick and unwitting, into strange neighborhoods. Nor</p>
<p>had that day been the first time she had seen him.</p>
<p>&quot;Remember the Bricklayers&#x27; Picnic at Weasel Park7&quot; Billy was</p>
<p>asking. &quot;An&#x27; the foot race? Why, I&#x27;d know that nose of yours</p>
<p>anywhere among a million. You was the guy that stuck your cane</p>
<p>between Timothy McManus&#x27;s legs an&#x27; started the grandest</p>
<p>roughhouse Weasel Park or any other park ever seen.&quot;</p>
<p>The visitor now commenced to laugh. He stood on one leg as he</p>
<p>laughed harder, then stood on the other leg. Finally he sat down</p>
<p>on a log of driftwood.</p>
<p>&quot;And you were there,&quot; he managed to gasp to Billy at last. &quot;You</p>
<p>saw it. You saw it.&quot; He turned to Saxon. &quot;--And you?&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; Billy began again, as their laughter eased down, &quot;what I</p>
<p>wants know is what&#x27;d you wanta do it for. Say, what&#x27;d you wants</p>
<p>do it for? I&#x27;ve been askin&#x27; that to myeelf ever since.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So have I,&quot; was the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn&#x27;t know Timothy McManus, did you7&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; I&#x27;d never seen him before, and I&#x27;ve never seen him since.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what&#x27;d you wanta do it for?&quot; Billy persisted.</p>
<p>The young man laughed, then controlled himself.</p>
<p>&quot;To save my life, I don&#x27;t know. I have one friend, a most</p>
<p>intelligent chap that writes sober, scientific books, and he&#x27;s</p>
<p>always aching to throw an egg into an electric fan to see what</p>
<p>will happen.  Perhaps that&#x27;s the way it was with me, except that</p>
<p>there was no aching. When I saw those legs flying past, I merely</p>
<p>stuck my stick in between. I didn&#x27;t know I was going to do it. I</p>
<p>just did it. Timothy McManus was no more surprised than I was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did they catch you?&quot; Billy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I look as if they did? I was never so scared in my life.</p>
<p>Timothy McManus himself couldn&#x27;t have caught me that day. But</p>
<p>what happened afterward? I heard they had a fearful roughhouse,</p>
<p>but I couldn&#x27;t stop to see.&quot;</p>
<p>It was not until a quarter of an hour had passed, during which</p>
<p>Billy described the fight, that introductions took place. Mark</p>
<p>Hall was their visitor&#x27;s name, and he lived in a bungalow among</p>
<p>the Carmel pines.</p>
<p>&quot;But how did you ever find your way to Bierce&#x27;s Cove?&quot; he was</p>
<p>curious to know. &quot;Nobody ever dreams of it from the road.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So that&#x27;s its name?&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the name we gave it. One of our crowd camped here one</p>
<p>summer, and we named it after him. I&#x27;ll take a cup of that</p>
<p>coffee, if you don&#x27;t mind.&quot;--This to Saxon. &quot;And then I&#x27;ll show</p>
<p>your husband around. We&#x27;re pretty proud of this cove. Nobody ever</p>
<p>comes here but ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You didn&#x27;t get all that muscle from bein&#x27; chased by McManus,&quot;</p>
<p>Billy observed over the coffee.</p>
<p>&quot;Massage under tension,&quot; was the cryptic reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Billy said, pondering vacantly. &quot;Do you eat it with a</p>
<p>spoon?&quot;</p>
<p>Hall laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll show you. Take any muscle you want, tense it, then</p>
<p>manipulate it with your fingers, so, and so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; that done all that&#x27;&quot; Billy asked skeptically.</p>
<p>&quot;All that!&quot; the other scorned proudly. &quot;For one muscle you see,</p>
<p>there&#x27;s five tucked away but under command. Touch your finger to</p>
<p>any part of me and see.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy complied, touching the right breast.</p>
<p>&quot;You know something about anatomy, picking a muscleless spot,&quot;</p>
<p>scolded Hall.</p>
<p>Billy grinned triumphantly, then, to his amazement, saw a muscle</p>
<p>grow up under his finger. He prodded it, and found it hard and</p>
<p>honest.</p>
<p>&quot;Massage under tension!&quot; Hall exulted. &quot;Go on--anywhere you</p>
<p>want.&quot;</p>
<p>And anywhere and everywhere Billy touched, muscles large and</p>
<p>small rose up, quivered, and sank down, till the whole body was a</p>
<p>ripple of willed quick.</p>
<p>&quot;Never saw anything like it,&quot; Billy marveled at the end; &quot;an&#x27;</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen some few good men stripped in my time. Why, you&#x27;re all</p>
<p>living silk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Massage under tension did it, my friend. The doctors gave me up.</p>
<p>My friends called me the sick rat, and the mangy poet, and all</p>
<p>that. Then I quit the city, came down to Carmel, and went in for</p>
<p>the open air--and massage under tension.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jim Hazard didn&#x27;t get his muscles that way,&quot; Billy challenged.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly not, the lucky skunk; he was born with them. Mine&#x27;s</p>
<p>made. That&#x27;s the difference. I&#x27;m a work of art. He&#x27;s a cave bear.</p>
<p>Come along. I&#x27;ll show you around now. You&#x27;d better get your</p>
<p>clothes off. Keep on only your shoes and pants, unless you&#x27;ve got</p>
<p>a pair of trunks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother was a poet,&quot; Saxon said, while Billy was getting</p>
<p>himself ready in the thicket. She had noted Hall&#x27;s reference to</p>
<p>himself.</p>
<p>He seemed incurious, and she ventured further.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of it was printed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was her name?&quot; he asked idly.</p>
<p>&quot;Dayelle Wiley Brown. She wrote: &#x27;The Viking&#x27;s Quest&#x27;;</p>
<p>&#x27;Days of Gold&#x27;; &#x27;Constancy&#x27;; &#x27;The Caballero&#x27;; &#x27;Graves at</p>
<p>Little Meadow&#x27;; and a lot more. Ten of them are in &#x27;The</p>
<p>Story of the Files.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve the book at home,&quot; he remarked, for the first time showing</p>
<p>real interest. &quot;She was a pioneer, of course--before my time.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll look her up when I get back to the house. My people were</p>
<p>pioneers. They came by Panama, in the Fifties, from Long Island.</p>
<p>My father was a doctor, but he went into business in San</p>
<p>Francisco and robbed his fellow men out of enough to keep me and</p>
<p>the rest of a large family going ever since.--Say, where are you</p>
<p>and your husband bound?&quot;</p>
<p>When Saxon had told him of their attempt to get away from Oakland</p>
<p>and of their quest for land, he sympathized with the first and</p>
<p>shook his head over the second.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful down beyond the Sur,&quot; he told her. &quot;I&#x27;ve been all</p>
<p>over those redwood canyons, and the place is alive with game. The</p>
<p>government land is there, too. But you&#x27;d be foolish to settle.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s too remote. And it isn&#x27;t good farming land, except in</p>
<p>patches in the canyons. I know a Mexican there who is wild to</p>
<p>sell his five hundred acres for fifteen hundred dollars. Three</p>
<p>dollars an acre! And what does that mean? That it isn&#x27;t worth</p>
<p>more. That it isn&#x27;t worth so much; because he can find no takers.</p>
<p>Land, you know, is worth what they buy and sell it for.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy, emerging from the thicket, only in shoes and in pants</p>
<p>rolled to the knees, put an end to the conversation; and Saxon</p>
<p>watched the two men, physically so dissimilar, climb the rocks</p>
<p>and start out the south side of the cove. At first her eyes</p>
<p>followed them lazily, but soon she grew interested and</p>
<p>worried. Hall was leading Billy up what seemed a perpendicular</p>
<p>wall in order to gain the backbone of the rock. Billy went</p>
<p>slowly, displaying extreme caution; but twice she saw him slip,</p>
<p>the weather-eaten stone crumbling away in his hand and rattling</p>
<p>beneath him into the cove. When Hall reached the top, a hundred</p>
<p>feet above the sea, she saw him stand upright and sway easily on</p>
<p>the knife-edge which she knew fell away as abruptly on the other</p>
<p>side. Billy, once on top, contented himself with crouching on</p>
<p>hands and knees. The leader went on, upright, walking as easily</p>
<p>as on a level floor. Billy abandoned the hands and knees</p>
<p>position, but crouched closely and often helped himself with his</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>The knife-edge backbone was deeply serrated, and into one of the</p>
<p>notches both men disappeared. Saxon could not keep down her</p>
<p>anxiety, and climbed out on the north side of the cove, which was</p>
<p>less rugged and far less difficult to travel. Even so, the</p>
<p>unaccustomed height, the crumbling surface, and the fierce</p>
<p>buffets of the wind tried her nerve. Soon she was opposite the</p>
<p>men. They had leaped a narrow chasm and were scaling another</p>
<p>tooth. Already Billy was going more nimbly, but his leader often</p>
<p>paused and waited for him. The way grew severer, and several</p>
<p>times the clefts they essayed extended down to the ocean level</p>
<p>and spouted spray from the growling breakers that burst through.</p>
<p>At other times, standing erect, they would fall forward across</p>
<p>deep and narrow clefts until their palms met the opposing side;</p>
<p>then, clinging with their fingers, their bodies would be drawn</p>
<p>across and up.</p>
<p>Near the end, Hall and Billy went out of sight over the south</p>
<p>side of the backbone, and when Saxon saw them again they were</p>
<p>rounding the extreme point of rock and coming back on the cove</p>
<p>side. Here the way seemed barred. A wide fissure, with hopelessly</p>
<p>vertical sides, yawned skywards from a foam-white vortex where</p>
<p>the mad waters shot their level a dozen feet upward and dropped</p>
<p>it as abruptly to the black depths of battered rock and</p>
<p>writhing weed.</p>
<p>Clinging precariously, the men descended their side till the</p>
<p>spray was flying about them. Here they paused. Saxon could see</p>
<p>Hall pointing down across the fissure and imagined he was showing</p>
<p>some curious thing to Billy. She was not prepared for what</p>
<p>followed. The surf-level sucked and sank away, and across and</p>
<p>down Hall jumped to a narrow foothold where the wash had roared</p>
<p>yards deep the moment before. Without pause, as the returning sea</p>
<p>rushed up, he was around the sharp corner and clawing upward hand</p>
<p>and foot to escape being caught. Billy was now left alone. He</p>
<p>could not even see Hall, much less be further advised by him, and</p>
<p>so tensely did Saxon watch, that the pain in her finger-tips,</p>
<p>crushed to the rock by which she held, warned her to relax. Billy</p>
<p>waited his chance, twice made tentative preparations to leap and</p>
<p>sank back, then leaped across and down to the momentarily exposed</p>
<p>foothold, doubled the corner, and as he clawed up to join Hall</p>
<p>was washed to the waist but not torn away.</p>
<p>Saxon did not breathe easily till they rejoined her at the fire.</p>
<p>One glance at Billy told her that he was exceedingly disgusted</p>
<p>with himself.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll do, for a beginner,&quot; Hall cried, slapping him jovially on</p>
<p>the bare shoulder. &quot;That climb is a stunt of mine. Many&#x27;s the</p>
<p>brave lad that&#x27;s started with me and broken down before we were</p>
<p>half way out. I&#x27;ve had a dozen balk at that big jump. Only the</p>
<p>athletes make it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I ain&#x27;t ashamed of admittin&#x27; I was scairt,&quot; Billy growled.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re a regular goat, an&#x27; you sure got my goat half a dozen</p>
<p>times. But I&#x27;m mad now. It&#x27;s mostly trainin&#x27;, an&#x27; I&#x27;m goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>camp right here an&#x27; train till I can challenge you to a race out</p>
<p>an&#x27; around an&#x27; back to the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Done,&quot; said Hall, putting out his hand in ratification. &quot;And</p>
<p>some time, when we get together in San Francisco, I&#x27;ll lead you</p>
<p>up against Bierce--the one this cove is named after. His favorite</p>
<p>stunt, when he isn&#x27;t collecting rattlesnakes, is to wait for a</p>
<p>forty-mile-an-hour breeze, and then get up and walk on the</p>
<p>parapet of a skyscraper--on the lee side, mind you, so that if he</p>
<p>blows off there&#x27;s nothing to fetch him up but the street. He</p>
<p>sprang that on me once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you do it!&quot; Billy asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have if I hadn&#x27;t been on. I&#x27;d been practicing it</p>
<p>secretly for a week. And I got twenty dollars out of him on the</p>
<p>bet.&quot;</p>
<p>The tide was now low enough for mussel gathering and Saxon</p>
<p>accompanied the men out the north wall. Hall had several sacks to</p>
<p>fill. A rig was coming for him in the afternoon, he explained, to</p>
<p>cart the mussels back to Carmel. When the sacks were full they</p>
<p>ventured further among the rock crevices and were rewarded with</p>
<p>three abalones, among the shells of which Saxon found one coveted</p>
<p>blister-pearl. Hall initiated them into the mysteries of pounding</p>
<p>and preparing the abalone meat for cooking.</p>
<p>By this time it seemed to Saxon that they had known him a long</p>
<p>time. It reminded her of the old times when Bert had been with</p>
<p>them, singing his songs or ranting about the last of the</p>
<p>Mohicans.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, listen; I&#x27;m going to teach you something,&quot; Hall commanded,</p>
<p>a large round rock poised in his hand above the abalone meat.</p>
<p>&quot;You must never, never pound abalone without singing this song.</p>
<p>Nor must you sing this song at any other time. It would be the</p>
<p>rankest sacrilege. Abalone is the food of the gods. Its</p>
<p>preparation is a religious function. Now listen, and follow, and</p>
<p>remember that it is a very solemn occasion.&quot;</p>
<p>The stone came down with a thump on the white meat, and</p>
<p>thereafter arose and fell in a sort of tom-tom accompaniment to</p>
<p>the poet&#x27;s song:</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! some folks boast of quail on toast,</p>
<p>Because they think it&#x27;s tony;</p>
<p>But I&#x27;m content to owe my rent</p>
<p>And live on abalone.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Mission Point&#x27;s a friendly joint</p>
<p>Where every crab&#x27;s a crony,</p>
<p>And true and kind you&#x27;ll ever find</p>
<p>The clinging abalone.</p>
<p>&quot;He wanders free beside the sea</p>
<p>Where &#x27;er the coast is stony;</p>
<p>He flaps his wings and madly sings--</p>
<p>The plaintive abalone.</p>
<p>&quot;Some stick to biz, some flirt with Liz</p>
<p>Down on the sands of Coney;</p>
<p>But we, by hell, stay in Carmel,</p>
<p>And whang the abalone.&quot;</p>
<p>He paused with his mouth open and stone upraised. There was a</p>
<p>rattle of wheels and a voice calling from above where the sacks</p>
<p>of mussels had been carried. He brought the stone down with a</p>
<p>final thump and stood up.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s a thousand more verses like those,&quot; he said. &quot;Sorry I</p>
<p>hadn&#x27;t time to teach you them.&quot; He held out his hand, palm</p>
<p>downward. &quot;And now, children, bless you, you are now members of</p>
<p>the clan of Abalone Eaters, and I solemnly enjoin you, never, no</p>
<p>matter what the circumstances, pound abalone meat without</p>
<p>chanting the sacred words I have revealed unto you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we can&#x27;t remember the words from only one hearing,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>expostulated.</p>
<p>&quot;That shall be attended to. Next Sunday the Tribe of Abalone</p>
<p>Eaters will descend upon you here in Bierce&#x27;s Cove, and you will</p>
<p>be able to see the rites, the writers and writeresses, down even</p>
<p>to the Iron Man with the basilisk eyes, vulgarly known as the</p>
<p>King of the Sacerdotal Lizards.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will Jim Hazard come?&quot; Billy called, as Hall disappeared into</p>
<p>the thicket.</p>
<p>&quot;He will certainly come. Is he not the Cave-Bear Pot-Walloper and</p>
<p>Gridironer, the most fearsome, and, next to me, the most exalted,</p>
<p>of all the Abalone Eaters?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon and Billy could only look at each other till they heard the</p>
<p>wheels rattle away.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;ll be doggoned,&quot; Billy let out. &quot;He&#x27;s some boy, that.</p>
<p>Nothing stuck up about him. Just like Jim Hazard, comes along and</p>
<p>makes himself at home, you&#x27;re as good as he is an&#x27; he&#x27;s as good</p>
<p>as you, an&#x27; we&#x27;re all friends together, just like that, right off</p>
<p>the bat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s old stock, too,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;He told me while you were</p>
<p>undressing. His folks came by Panama before the railroad was</p>
<p>built, and from what he said I guess he&#x27;s got plenty of money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He sure don&#x27;t act like it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And isn&#x27;t he full of fun!&quot; Saxon cried.</p>
<p>&quot;A regular josher. An&#x27; HIM!--a POET!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know, Billy. I&#x27;ve heard that plenty of poets are</p>
<p>odd.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, come to think of it. There&#x27;s Joaquin Miller, lives</p>
<p>out in the hills back of Fruitvale. He&#x27;s certainly odd. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>right near his place where I proposed to you. Just the same I</p>
<p>thought poets wore whiskers and eyeglasses, an&#x27; never tripped up</p>
<p>foot-racers at Sunday picnics, nor run around with as few clothes</p>
<p>on as the law allows, gatherin&#x27; mussels an&#x27; climbin&#x27; like goats.&quot;</p>
<p>That night, under the blankets, Saxon lay awake, looking at the</p>
<p>stars, pleasuring in the balmy thicket-scents, and listening to</p>
<p>the dull rumble of the outer surf and the whispering ripples on</p>
<p>the sheltered beach a few feet away. Billy stirred, and she knew</p>
<p>he was not yet asleep.</p>
<p>&quot;Glad you left Oakland, Billy?&quot; she snuggled.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!&quot; came his answer. &quot;Is a clam happy?&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
<p>Every half tide Billy raced out the south wall over the dangerous</p>
<p>course he and Hall had traveled, and each trial found him doing</p>
<p>it in faster time.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait till Sunday,&quot; he said to Saxon. &quot;I&#x27;ll give that poet a run</p>
<p>for his money. Why, they ain&#x27;t a place that bothers me now. I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>got the head confidence. I run where I went on hands an&#x27; knees. I</p>
<p>figured it out this way: Suppose you had a foot to fall on each</p>
<p>side, an&#x27; it was soft hay. They&#x27;d be nothing to stop you. You</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t fall. You&#x27;d go like a streak. Then it&#x27;s just the same if</p>
<p>it&#x27;s a mile down on each side. That ain&#x27;t your concern. Your</p>
<p>concern is to stay on top and go like a streak. An&#x27;, d&#x27;ye know,</p>
<p>Saxon, when I went at it that way it never bothered me at all.</p>
<p>Wait till he comes with his crowd Sunday. I&#x27;m ready for him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder what the crowd will be like,&quot; Saxon speculated.</p>
<p>&quot;Like him, of course. Birds of a feather flock together. They</p>
<p>won&#x27;t be stuck up, any of them, you&#x27;ll see.&quot;</p>
<p>Hall had sent out fish-lines and a swimming suit by a Mexican</p>
<p>cowboy bound south to his ranch, and from the latter they learned</p>
<p>much of the government land and how to get it. The week flew by;</p>
<p>each day Saxon sighed a farewell of happiness to the sun; each</p>
<p>morning they greeted its return with laughter of joy in that</p>
<p>another happy day had begun. They made no plans, but fished,</p>
<p>gathered mussels and abalones, and climbed among the rocks as the</p>
<p>moment moved them. The abalone meat they pounded religiously to a</p>
<p>verse of doggerel improvised by Saxon. Billy prospered. Saxon had</p>
<p>never seen him at so keen a pitch of health. As for herself, she</p>
<p>scarcely needed the little hand-mirror to know that never, since</p>
<p>she was a young girl, had there been such color in her cheeks,</p>
<p>such spontaneity of vivacity.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the first time in my life I ever had real play,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>said. &quot;An&#x27; you an&#x27; me never played at all all the time we was</p>
<p>married. This beats bein&#x27; any kind of a millionaire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No seven o&#x27;clock whistle,&quot; Saxon exulted. &quot;I&#x27;d lie abed in the</p>
<p>mornings on purpose, only everything is too good not to be up.</p>
<p>And now you just play at chopping some firewood and catching a</p>
<p>nice big perch, Man Friday, if you expect to get any dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy got up, hatchet in hand, from where he had been lying</p>
<p>prone, digging holes in the sand with his bare toes.</p>
<p>&quot;But it ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to last,&quot; he said, with a deep sigh of</p>
<p>regret. &quot;The rains&#x27;ll come any time now. The good weather&#x27;s</p>
<p>hangin&#x27; on something wonderful.&quot;</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, returning from his run out the south wall,</p>
<p>he missed Saxon. After helloing for her without result, he</p>
<p>climbed to the road. Half a mile away, he saw her astride an</p>
<p>unsaddled, unbridled horse that moved unwillingly, at a slow</p>
<p>walk, across the pasture.</p>
<p>&quot;Lucky for you it was an old mare that had been used to</p>
<p>ridin&#x27;--see them saddle marks,&quot; he grumbled, when she at last</p>
<p>drew to a halt beside him and allowed him to help her down.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Billy,&quot; she sparkled, &quot;I was never on a horse before. It was</p>
<p>glorious! I felt so helpless, too, and so brave.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m proud of you, just the same,&quot; he said, in more grumbling</p>
<p>tones than before. &quot; &#x27;Tain&#x27;t every married women&#x27;d tackle a</p>
<p>strange horse that way, especially if she&#x27;d never ben on one.</p>
<p>An&#x27; I ain&#x27;t forgot that you&#x27;re goin&#x27; to have a saddle animal all</p>
<p>to yourself some day--a regular Joe dandy.&quot;</p>
<p>The Abalone Eaters, in two rigs and on a number of horses,</p>
<p>descended in force on Bierce&#x27;s Cove. There were half a score of</p>
<p>men and almost as many women. All were young, between the ages of</p>
<p>twenty-five and forty, and all seemed good friends. Most of them</p>
<p>were married. They arrived in a roar of good spirits, tripping</p>
<p>one another down the slippery trail and engulfing Saxon and Billy</p>
<p>in a comradeship as artless and warm as the sunshine itself.</p>
<p>Saxon was appropriated by the girls--she could not realize them</p>
<p>women; and they made much of her, praising her camping and</p>
<p>traveling equipment and insisting on hearing some of her tale.</p>
<p>They were experienced campers themselves, as she quickly</p>
<p>discovered when she saw the pots and pans and clothes-boilers for</p>
<p>the mussels which they had brought.</p>
<p>In the meantime Billy and the men had undressed and scattered out</p>
<p>after mussels and abalones. The girls lighted on Saxon&#x27;s ukulele</p>
<p>and nothing would do but she must play and sing. Several of them</p>
<p>had been to Honolulu, and knew the instrument, confirming</p>
<p>Mercedes&#x27; definition of ukulele as &quot;jumping flea.&quot; Also, they</p>
<p>knew Hawaiian songs she had learned from Mercedes, and soon, to</p>
<p>her accompaniment, all were singing: &quot;Aloha Oe,&quot; &quot;Honolulu</p>
<p>Tomboy,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Lei Lehua.&quot; Saxon was genuinely shocked when</p>
<p>some of them, even the more matronly, danced hulas on the sand.</p>
<p>When the men returned, burdened with sacks of shellfish, Mark</p>
<p>Hall, as high priest, commanded the due and solemn rite of the</p>
<p>tribe. At a wave of his hand, the many poised stones came down in</p>
<p>unison on the white meat, and all voices were uplifted in the</p>
<p>Hymn to the Abalone. Old verses all sang, ocasionally some one</p>
<p>sang a fresh verse alone, whereupon it was repeated in chorus.</p>
<p>Billy betrayed Saxon by begging her in an undertone to sing the</p>
<p>verse she had made, and her pretty voice was timidly raised in:</p>
<p>&quot;We sit around and gaily pound,</p>
<p>And bear no acrimony</p>
<p>Because our ob--ject is a gob</p>
<p>Of sizzling abalone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great!&quot; cried the poet, who had winced at ob--ject. &quot;She speaks</p>
<p>the language of the tribe! Come on, children--now!&quot;</p>
<p>And all chanted Saxon&#x27;s lines. Then Jim Hazard had a new verse,</p>
<p>and one of the girls, and the Iron Man with the basilisk eyes of</p>
<p>greenish-gray, whom Saxon recognized from Hall&#x27;s description. To</p>
<p>her it seemed he had the face of a priest.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! some like ham and some like lamb</p>
<p>And some like macaroni;</p>
<p>But bring me in a pail of gin</p>
<p>And a tub of abalone.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! some drink rain and some champagne</p>
<p>Or brandy by the pony;</p>
<p>But I will try a little rye</p>
<p>With a dash of abalone.</p>
<p>&quot;Some live on hope and some on dope</p>
<p>And some on alimony.</p>
<p>But our tom-cat, he lives on fat</p>
<p>And tender abalone.&quot;</p>
<p>A black-haired, black-eyed man with the roguish face of a satyr,</p>
<p>who, Saxon learned, was an artist who sold his paintings at five</p>
<p>hundred apiece, brought on himself universa1 execration and</p>
<p>acclamation by singing:</p>
<p>&quot;The more we take, the more they make</p>
<p>In deep sea matrimony;</p>
<p>Race suicide cannot betide</p>
<p>The fertile abalone.&quot;</p>
<p>And so it went, verses new and old, verses without end, all in</p>
<p>glorification of the succulent shellfish of Carmel. Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>enjoyment was keen, almost ecstatic, and she had diffculty in</p>
<p>convincing herself of the reality of it all. It seemed like some</p>
<p>fairy tale or book story come true. Again, it seemed more like a</p>
<p>stage, and these the actors, she and Billy having blundered into</p>
<p>the scene in some incomprehensible way. Much of wit she sensed</p>
<p>which she did not understand. Much she did understand. And she</p>
<p>was aware that brains were playing as she had never seen brains</p>
<p>play before. The puritan streak in her training was astonished</p>
<p>and shocked by some of the broadness; but she refused to sit in</p>
<p>judgment. They SEEMED good, these light-hearted young people;</p>
<p>they certainly were not rough or gross as were many of the crowds</p>
<p>she had been with on Sunday picnics. None of the men got drunk,</p>
<p>although there were cocktails in vacuum bottles and red wine in a</p>
<p>huge demijohn.</p>
<p>What impressed Saxon most was their excessive jollity, their</p>
<p>childlike joy, and the childlike things they did. This effect was</p>
<p>heightened by the fact that they were novelists and painters,</p>
<p>poets and critics, sculptors and musicians. One man, with a</p>
<p>refined and delicate face--a dramatic critic on a great San</p>
<p>Francisco daily, she was told--introduced a feat which all the</p>
<p>men tried and failed at most ludicrously. On the beach, at</p>
<p>regular intervals, planks were placed as obstacles. Then the</p>
<p>dramatic critic, on all fours, galloped along the sand for all</p>
<p>the world like a horse, and for all the world like a horse taking</p>
<p>hurdles he jumped the planks to the end of the course.</p>
<p>Quoits had been brought along, and for a while these were pitched</p>
<p>with zest. Then jumping was started, and game slid into game.</p>
<p>Billy took part in everything, but did not win first place as</p>
<p>often as he had expected. An English writer beat him a dozen feet</p>
<p>at tossing the caber. Jim Hazard beat him in putting the heavy</p>
<p>&quot;rock.&quot; Mark Hall out-jumped him standing and running. But at the</p>
<p>standing high back-jump Billy did come first. Despite the</p>
<p>handicap of his weight, this victory was due to his splendid back</p>
<p>and abdominal lifting muscles. Immediately after this, however,</p>
<p>he was brought to grief by Mark Hall&#x27;s sister, a strapping young</p>
<p>amazon in cross-saddle riding costume, who three times tumbled</p>
<p>him ignominiously heels over head in a bout of Indian wrestling.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re easy,&quot; jeered the Iron Man, whose name they had learned</p>
<p>was Pete Bideaux. &quot;I can put you down myself,</p>
<p>catch-as-catch-can.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy accepted the challenge, and found in all truth that the</p>
<p>other was rightly nicknamed. In the training camps Billy had</p>
<p>sparred and clinched with giant champions like Jim Jeffries and</p>
<p>Jack Johnson, and met the weight of their strength, but never had</p>
<p>he encountered strength like this of the Iron Man. Do what he</p>
<p>could, Billy was powerless, and twice his shoulders were ground</p>
<p>into the sand in defeat.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll get a chance back at him,&quot; Hazard whispered to Billy, off</p>
<p>at one side. &quot;I&#x27;ve brought the gloves along. Of course, you had</p>
<p>no chance with him at his own game. He&#x27;s wrestled in the music</p>
<p>halls in London with Hackenschmidt. Now you keep quiet, and we&#x27;ll</p>
<p>lead up to it in a casual sort of way. He doesn&#x27;t know about</p>
<p>you.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon, the Englishman who had tossed the caber was sparring with</p>
<p>the dramatic critic, Hazard and Hall boxed in fantastic</p>
<p>burlesque, then, gloves in hand, looked for the next</p>
<p>appropriately matched couple. The choice of Bideaux and Billy was</p>
<p>obvious.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s liable to get nasty if he&#x27;s hurt,&quot; Hazard warned Billy, as</p>
<p>he tied on the gloves for him. &quot;He&#x27;s old American French, and</p>
<p>he&#x27;s got a devil of a temper. But just keep your head and tap</p>
<p>him--whatever you do, keep tapping him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Easy sparring now&quot;; &quot;No roughhouse, Bideaux&quot;; &quot;Just light</p>
<p>tapping, you know,&quot; were admonitions variously addressed to the</p>
<p>Iron Man.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on a second,&quot; he said to Billy, dropping his hands. &quot;When I</p>
<p>get rapped I do get a bit hot. But don&#x27;t mind me. I can&#x27;t help</p>
<p>it, you know. It&#x27;s only for the moment, and I don&#x27;t mean it.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon felt very nervous, visions of Billy&#x27;s bloody fights and all</p>
<p>the scabs he had slugged rising in her brain; but she had never</p>
<p>seen her husband box, and but few seconds were required to put</p>
<p>her at ease. The Iron Man had no chance. Billy was too completely</p>
<p>the master, guarding every blow, himself continually and almost</p>
<p>at will tapping the other&#x27;s face and body. There was no weight in</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s blows, only a light and snappy tingle; but their</p>
<p>incessant iteration told on the Iron Man&#x27;s temper. In vain the</p>
<p>onlookers warned him to go easy. His face purpled with anger, and</p>
<p>his blows became savage. But Billy went on, tap, tap, tap,</p>
<p>calmly, gently, imperturbably. The Iron Man lost control, and</p>
<p>rushed and plunged, delivering great swings and upper-cuts of</p>
<p>man-killing quality. Billy ducked, side-stepped, blocked,</p>
<p>stalled, and escaped all damage. In the clinches, which were</p>
<p>unavoidable, he locked the Iron Man&#x27;s arms, and in the clinches</p>
<p>the Iron Man invariably laughed and apologized, only to lose his</p>
<p>head with the first tap the instant they separated and be more</p>
<p>infuriated than ever.</p>
<p>And when it was over and Billy&#x27;s identity had been divulged, the</p>
<p>Iron Man accepted the joke on himself with the best of humor. It</p>
<p>had been a splendid exhibition on Billy&#x27;s part. His mastery of</p>
<p>the sport, coupled with his self-control, had most favorably</p>
<p>impressed the crowd, and Saxon, very proud of her man boy, could</p>
<p>not but see the admiration all had for him.</p>
<p>Nor did she prove in any way a social failure. When the tired and</p>
<p>sweating players lay down in the dry sand to cool off, she was</p>
<p>persuaded into accompanying their nonsense songs with the</p>
<p>ukulele. Nor was it long, catching their spirit, ere she was</p>
<p>singing to them and teaching them quaint songs of early days</p>
<p>which she had herself learned as a little girl from Cady--Cady,</p>
<p>the saloonkeeper, pioneer, and ax-cavalryman, who had been a</p>
<p>bull-whacker on the Salt Intake Trail in the days before the</p>
<p>railroad.</p>
<p>One song which became an immediate favorite was:</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! times on Bitter Creek, they never can be beat,</p>
<p>Root hog or die is on every wagon sheet;</p>
<p>The sand within your throat, the dust within your eye,</p>
<p>Bend your back and stand it--root hog or die.&quot;</p>
<p>After the dozen verses of &quot;Root Hog or Die,&quot; Mark Hall claimed</p>
<p>to be especially infatuated with:</p>
<p>&quot;Obadier, he dreampt a dream,</p>
<p>Dreampt he was drivin&#x27; a ten-mule team,</p>
<p>But when he woke he heaved a sigh,</p>
<p>The lead-mule kicked e-o-wt the swing-mule&#x27;s eye.&quot;</p>
<p>It was Mark Hall who brought up the matter of Billy&#x27;s challenge</p>
<p>to race out the south wall of the cove, though he referred to the</p>
<p>test as lying somewhere in the future. Billy surprised him by</p>
<p>saying he was ready at any time. Forthwith the crowd clamored for</p>
<p>the race. Hall offered to bet on himself, but there were no</p>
<p>takers. He offered two to one to Jim Hazard, who shook his head</p>
<p>and said he would accept three to one as a sporting proposition.</p>
<p>Billy heard and gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll take you for five dollars,&quot; he said to Hall, &quot;but not at</p>
<p>those odds. I&#x27;ll back myself even.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It isn&#x27;t your money I want; it&#x27;s Hazard&#x27;s,&quot; Hall demurred.</p>
<p>&quot;Though I&#x27;ll give either of you three to one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even or nothing,&quot; Billy held out obstinately.</p>
<p>Hall finally closed both bets--even with Billy, and three to one</p>
<p>with Hazard.</p>
<p>The path along the knife-edge was so narorw that it was</p>
<p>impossible for runners to pass each other, so it was arranged to</p>
<p>time the men, Hall to go first and Billy to follow after an</p>
<p>interval of half a minute.</p>
<p>Hall toed the mark and at the word was off with the form of a</p>
<p>sprinter. Saxon&#x27;s heart sank. She knew Billy had never crossed</p>
<p>the stretch of sand at that speed. Billy darted forward thirty</p>
<p>seconds later, and reached the foot of the rock when Hall was</p>
<p>half way up. When both were on top and racing from notch to</p>
<p>notch, the Iron Man announced that they had scaled the wall in</p>
<p>the same time to a second.</p>
<p>&quot;My money still looks good,&quot; Hazard remarked, &quot;though I hope</p>
<p>neither of them breaks a neck. I wouldn&#x27;t take that run that way</p>
<p>for all the gold that would fill the cove.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you&#x27;ll take bigger chances swimming in a storm on Carmel</p>
<p>Beach,&quot; his wife chided.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; he retorted. &quot;You haven&#x27;t so far to fall when</p>
<p>swimming.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy and Hall had disappeared and were making the circle around</p>
<p>the end. Those on the beach were certain that the poet had gained</p>
<p>in the dizzy spurts of flight along the knife-edge. Even Hazard</p>
<p>admitted it.</p>
<p>&quot;What price for my money now?&quot; he cried excitedly, dancing up and</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>Hall had reappeared, the great jump accomplished, and was running</p>
<p>shoreward. But there was no gap. Billy was on his heels, and on</p>
<p>his heels he stayed, in to shore, down the wall, and to the mark</p>
<p>on the beach. Billy had won by half a minute.</p>
<p>&quot;Only by the watch,&quot; he panted. &quot;Hall was over half a minute</p>
<p>ahead of me out to the end. I&#x27;m not slower than I thought, but</p>
<p>he&#x27;s faster. He&#x27;s a wooz of a sprinter. He could beat me ten</p>
<p>times outa ten, except for accident. He was hung up at the jump</p>
<p>by a big sea. That&#x27;s where I caught &#x27;m. I jumped right after &#x27;m</p>
<p>on the same sea, then he set the pace home, and all I had to do</p>
<p>was take it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s all right,&quot; said Hall. &quot;You did better than beat me.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the first time in the history of Bierce&#x27;s Cove that two</p>
<p>men made that jump on the same sea. And all the risk was yours,</p>
<p>coming last.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a fluke,&quot; Billy insisted.</p>
<p>And at that point Saxon settled the dispute of modesty and raised</p>
<p>a general laugh by rippling chords on the ukulele and parodying</p>
<p>an old hymn in negro minstrel fashion:</p>
<p>&quot;De Lawd move in er mischievous way</p>
<p>His blunders to perform.&quot;</p>
<p>In the afternoon Jim Hazard and Hall dived into the breakers and</p>
<p>swam to the outlying rocks, routing the protesting sea-lions and</p>
<p>taking possession of their surf-battered stronghold. Billy</p>
<p>followed the swimmers with his eyes, yearning after them so</p>
<p>undisguisedly that Mrs. Hazard said to him:</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#x27;t you stop in Carmel this winter? Jim will teach you all</p>
<p>he knows about the surf. And he&#x27;s wild to box with you. He works</p>
<p>long hours at his desk, and he really needs exercise.&quot;</p>
<p>Not until sunset did the merry crowd carry their pots and pans</p>
<p>and trove of mussels up to the road and depart. Saxon and Billy</p>
<p>watched them disappear, on horses and behind horses, over the top</p>
<p>of the first hill, and then descended hand in hand through the</p>
<p>thicket to the camp. Billy threw himself on the sand and</p>
<p>stretched out.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ve been so tired,&quot; he yawned. &quot;An&#x27; there&#x27;s</p>
<p>one thing sure: I never had such a day. It&#x27;s worth livin&#x27;twenty</p>
<p>years for an&#x27; then some.&quot;</p>
<p>He reached out his hand to Saxon, who lay beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;And, oh, I was so proud of you, Billy,&quot; she said. &quot;I never saw</p>
<p>you box before. I didn&#x27;t know it was like that. The Iron Man was</p>
<p>at your mercy all the time, and you kept it from being violent or</p>
<p>terrible. Everybody could look on and enjoy--and they did, too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh, I want to say you was goin&#x27; some yourself. They just took</p>
<p>to you. Why, honest to God, Saxon, in the singin&#x27; you was the</p>
<p>whole show, along with the ukulele. All the women liked you, too,</p>
<p>an&#x27; that&#x27;s what counts.&quot;</p>
<p>It was their first social triumph, and the taste of it was sweet:</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Hall said he&#x27;d looked up the &#x27;Story of the Files,&#x27;&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>recounted. &quot;And he said mother was a true poet. He said it was</p>
<p>astonishing the fine stock that had crossed the Plains. He told</p>
<p>me a lot about those times and the people I didn&#x27;t know. And he&#x27;s</p>
<p>read all about the fight at Little Meadow. He says he&#x27;s got it in</p>
<p>a book at home, and if we come back to Carmel he&#x27;ll show it to</p>
<p>me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He wants us to come back all right. D&#x27;ye know what he said to</p>
<p>me, Saxon t He gave me a letter to some guy that&#x27;s down on the</p>
<p>government land--some poet that&#x27;s holdin&#x27; down a quarter of a</p>
<p>section--so we&#x27;ll be able to stop there, which&#x27;ll come in handy</p>
<p>if the big rains catch us. An&#x27;--Oh! that&#x27;s what I was drivin&#x27; at.</p>
<p>He said he had a little shack he lived in while the house was</p>
<p>buildin&#x27;. The Iron Man&#x27;s livin&#x27; in it now, but he&#x27;s goin&#x27; away to</p>
<p>some Catholic college to study to be a priest, an&#x27; Hall said the</p>
<p>shack&#x27;d be ours as long as we wanted to use it. An&#x27; he said I</p>
<p>could do what the Iron Man was doin&#x27; to make a livin&#x27;. Hall was</p>
<p>kind of bashful when he was offerin&#x27; me work. Said it&#x27;d be only</p>
<p>odd jobs, but that we&#x27;d make out. I could help&#x27;m plant potatoes,</p>
<p>he said; an&#x27; he got half savage when he said I couldn&#x27;t chop</p>
<p>wood. That was his job, he said; an&#x27; you could see he was</p>
<p>actually jealous over it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Mrs. Hall said just about the same to me, Billy. Carmel</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t be so bad to pass the rainy season in. And then, too,</p>
<p>you could go swimming with Mr. Hazard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seems as if we could settle down wherever we&#x27;ve a mind to,&quot;</p>
<p>Billy assented. &quot;Carmel&#x27;s the third place now that&#x27;s offered.</p>
<p>Well, after this, no man need be afraid of makin&#x27; a go in the</p>
<p>country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No good man,&quot; Saxon corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you&#x27;re right.&quot; Billy thought for a moment. &quot;Just the</p>
<p>same a dub, too, has a better chance in the country than in the</p>
<p>city.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who&#x27;d have ever thought that such fine people existed?&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>pondered. &quot;It&#x27;s just wonderful, when you come to think of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s only what you&#x27;d expect from a rich poet that&#x27;d trip up a</p>
<p>foot-racer at an Irish picnic,&quot; Billy exposited.</p>
<p>&quot;The only crowd such a guy&#x27;d run with would be like himself, or</p>
<p>he&#x27;d make a crowd that was. I wouldn&#x27;t wonder that he&#x27;d make</p>
<p>this crowd. Say, he&#x27;s got some sister, if anybody&#x27;d ride up on a</p>
<p>sea-lion an&#x27; ask you. She&#x27;s got that Indian wrestlin&#x27; down pat,</p>
<p>an&#x27; she&#x27;s built for it. An&#x27; say, ain&#x27;t his wife a beaut?&quot;</p>
<p>A little longer they lay in the warm sand. It was Billy who broke</p>
<p>the silence, and what he said seemed to proceed out of profound</p>
<p>meditation.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon, d&#x27;ye know I don&#x27;t care if I never see movie pictures</p>
<p>again.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
<p>Saxon and Billy were gone weeks on the trip south, but in the end</p>
<p>they came back to Carmel. They had stopped with Hafler, the poets</p>
<p>in the Marble House, which he had built with his own hands. This</p>
<p>queer dwelling was all in one room, built almost entirely of</p>
<p>white marble. Hailer cooked, as over a campfire, in the huge</p>
<p>marble fireplace, which he used in all ways as a kitchen. There</p>
<p>were divers shelves of books, and the massive furniture he had</p>
<p>made from redwood, as he had made the shakes for the roof. A</p>
<p>blanket, stretched across a corner, gave Saxon privacy. The poet</p>
<p>was on the verge of departing for San Francisco and New York, but</p>
<p>remained a day over with them to explain the country and run over</p>
<p>the government land with Billy. Saxon had wanted to go along that</p>
<p>morning, but Hafler scornfully rejected her, telling her that her</p>
<p>legs were too short. That night, when the men returned, Billy was</p>
<p>played out to exhaustion. He frankly acknowledged that Hafler had</p>
<p>walked him into the ground, and that his tongue had been hanging</p>
<p>out from the first hour. Hafler estimated that they had covered</p>
<p>fifty-five miles.</p>
<p>&quot;But such miles!&quot; Billy enlarged. &quot;Half the time up or down, an&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;most all the time without trails. An&#x27; such a pace. He was dead</p>
<p>right about your short legs, Saxon. You wouldn&#x27;t a-lasted the</p>
<p>first mile. An&#x27; such country! We ain&#x27;t seen anything like it</p>
<p>yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Hafler left the next day to catch the train at Monterey. He gave</p>
<p>them the freedom of the Marble House, and told them to stay the</p>
<p>whole winter if they wanted. Billy elected to loaf around and</p>
<p>rest up that day. He was stiff and sore. Moreover, he was stunned</p>
<p>by the exhibition of walking prowess on the part of the poet.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody can do something top-notch down in this country,&quot; he</p>
<p>marveled. &quot;Now take that Hafler. He&#x27;s a bigger man than me, an&#x27; a</p>
<p>heavier. An&#x27; weight&#x27;s against walkin&#x27;, too. But not with him.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s done eighty miles inside twenty-four hours, he told me, an&#x27;</p>
<p>once a hundred an&#x27; seventy in three days. Why, he made a show</p>
<p>outa me. I felt ashamed as a little kid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remember, Billy,&quot; Saxon soothed him, &quot;every man to his own game.</p>
<p>And down here you&#x27;re a top-notcher at your own game. There isn&#x27;t</p>
<p>one you&#x27;re not the master of with the gloves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess that&#x27;s right,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But just the same it goes</p>
<p>against the grain to be walked off my legs by a poet--by a poet,</p>
<p>mind you.&quot;</p>
<p>They spent days in going over the government land, and in the end</p>
<p>reluctantly decided against taking it up. The redwood canyons and</p>
<p>great cliffs of the Santa Lucia Mountains fascinated Saxon; but</p>
<p>she remembered what Hafler had told her of the summer fogs which</p>
<p>hid the sun sometimes for a week or two at a time, and which</p>
<p>lingered for months. Then, too, there was no access to market.</p>
<p>It was many miles to where the nearest wagon road began, at</p>
<p>Post&#x27;s, and from there on, past Point Sur to Carmel, it was a</p>
<p>weary and perilous way. Billy, with his teamster judgment,</p>
<p>admitted that for heavy hauling it was anything but a picnic.</p>
<p>There was the quarry of perfect marble on Hafler&#x27;s quarter</p>
<p>section. He had said that it would be worth a fortune if near a</p>
<p>railroad; but, as it was, he&#x27;d make them a present of it if they</p>
<p>wanted it.</p>
<p>Billy visioned the grassy slopes pastured with his horses and</p>
<p>cattle, and found it hard to turn his back; but he listened with</p>
<p>a willing ear to Saxon&#x27;s argument in favor of a farm-home like</p>
<p>the one they had seen in the moving pictures in Oakland. Yes, he</p>
<p>agreed, what they wanted was an all-around farm, and an</p>
<p>all-around farm they would have if they hiked forty years to find</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>&quot;But it must have redwoods on it,&quot; Saxon hastened to stipulate.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve fallen in love with them. And we can get along without fog.</p>
<p>And there must be good wagon-roads, and a railroad not more than</p>
<p>a thousand miles away.&quot;</p>
<p>Heavy winter rains held them prisoners for two weeks in the</p>
<p>Marble House. Saxon browsed among Hafler&#x27;s books, though most of</p>
<p>them were depressingly beyond her, while Billy hunted with</p>
<p>Hafler&#x27;s guns. But he was a poor shot and a worse hunter. His</p>
<p>only success was with rabbits, which he managed to kill on</p>
<p>occasions when they stood still. With the rifle he got nothing,</p>
<p>although he fired at half a dozen different deer, and, once, at a</p>
<p>huge cat-creature with a long tail which he was certain was a</p>
<p>mountain lion. Despite the way he grumbled at himself, Saxon</p>
<p>could see the keen joy he was taking. This belated arousal of</p>
<p>the hunting instinct seemed to make almost another man of him. He</p>
<p>was out early and late, compassing prodigious climbs and</p>
<p>tramps--once reaching as far as the gold mines Tom had spoken of,</p>
<p>and being away two days.</p>
<p>&quot;Talk about pluggin&#x27; away at a job in the city, an&#x27; goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>movie&#x27; pictures and Sunday picnics for amusement!&quot; he would burst</p>
<p>out. &quot;I can&#x27;t see what was eatin&#x27; me that I ever put up with such</p>
<p>truck. Here&#x27;s where I oughta ben all the time, or some place</p>
<p>like it.&quot;</p>
<p>He was filled with this new mode of life, and was continually</p>
<p>recalling old hunting tales of his father and telling them to</p>
<p>Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, I don&#x27;t get stiffened any more after an all-day tramp,&quot; he</p>
<p>exulted. &quot;I&#x27;m broke in. An&#x27; some day, if I meet up with that</p>
<p>Hafler, I&#x27;ll challenge&#x27;m to a tramp that&#x27;ll break his heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Foolish boy, always wanting to play everybody&#x27;s game and beat</p>
<p>them at it,&quot; Saxon laughed delightedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, I guess you&#x27;re right,&quot; he growled. &quot;Hafler can always</p>
<p>out-walk me. He&#x27;s made that way. But some day, just the same, if</p>
<p>I ever see &#x27;m again, I&#x27;ll invite &#x27;m to put on the gloves....</p>
<p>though I won&#x27;t be mean enough to make &#x27;m as sore as he made me.&quot;</p>
<p>After they left Post&#x27;s on the way back to Carmel, the condition</p>
<p>of the road proved the wisdom of their rejection of the</p>
<p>government land. They passed a rancher&#x27;s wagon overturned, a</p>
<p>second wagon with a broken axle, and the stage a hundred yards</p>
<p>down the mountainside, where it had fallen, passengers, horses,</p>
<p>road, and all.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess they just about quit tryin&#x27; to use this road in the</p>
<p>winter,&quot; Billy said. &quot;It&#x27;s horse-killin&#x27; an&#x27; man-killin&#x27;, an&#x27; I</p>
<p>can just see &#x27;m freightin&#x27; that marble out over it I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>think.&quot;</p>
<p>Settling down at Carmel was an easy matter. The Iron Man had</p>
<p>already departed to his Catholic college, and the &quot;shack&quot; turned</p>
<p>out to be a three-roomed house comfortably furnished for</p>
<p>housekeeping. Hall put Billy to work on the potato patch--a</p>
<p>matter of three acres which the poet farmed erratically to the</p>
<p>huge delight of his crowd. He planted at all seasons, and it was</p>
<p>accepted by the community that what did not rot in the ground was</p>
<p>evenly divided between the gophers and trespassing cows. A plow</p>
<p>was borrowed, a team of horses hired, and Billy took hold. Also</p>
<p>he built a fence around the patch, and after that was set to</p>
<p>staining the shingled roof of the bungalow. Hall climbed to the</p>
<p>ridge-pole to repeat his warning that Billy must keep away from</p>
<p>his wood-pile. One morning Hall came over and watched Billy</p>
<p>chopping wood for Saxon. The poet looked on covetously as long as</p>
<p>he could restrain himself.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s plain you don&#x27;t know how to use an axe,&quot; he sneered. &quot;Here,</p>
<p>let me show you.&quot;</p>
<p>He worked away for an hour, all the while delivering an</p>
<p>exposition on the art of chopping wood.</p>
<p>&quot;Here,&quot; Billy expostulated at last, taking hold of the axe. &quot;I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>have to chop a cord of yours now in order to make this up to</p>
<p>you.&quot;</p>
<p>Hall surrendered the axe reluctantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t let me catch you around my wood-pile, that&#x27;s all, &quot; he</p>
<p>threatened. &quot;My wood-pile is my castle, and you&#x27;ve got to</p>
<p>understand that.&quot;</p>
<p>From a financial standpoint, Saxon and Billy were putting aside</p>
<p>much money. They paid no rent, their simple living was cheap, and</p>
<p>Billy had all the work he cared to accept. The various members of</p>
<p>the crowd seemed in a conspiracy to keep him busy. It was all odd</p>
<p>jobs, but he preferred it so, for it enabled him to suit his time</p>
<p>to Jim Hazard&#x27;s. Each day they boxed and took a long swim through</p>
<p>the surf. When Hazard finished his morning&#x27;s writing, he would</p>
<p>whoop through the pines to Billy, who dropped whatever work he</p>
<p>was doing. After the swim, they would take a fresh shower at</p>
<p>Hazard&#x27;s house, rub each other down in training camp style, and</p>
<p>be ready for the noon meal. In the afternoon Hazard returned to</p>
<p>his desk, and Billy to his outdoor work, although, still later,</p>
<p>they often met for a few miles&#x27; run over the hills. Training was</p>
<p>a matter of habit to both men. Hazard, when he had finished with</p>
<p>seven years of football, knowing the dire death that awaits the</p>
<p>big-muscled athlete who ceases training abruptly, had been</p>
<p>compelled to keep it up. Not only was it a necessity, but he had</p>
<p>grown to like it. Billy also liked it, for he took great delight</p>
<p>in the silk of his body.</p>
<p>Often, in the early morning, gun in hand, he was off with Mark</p>
<p>Hall, who taught him to shoot and hunt. Hall had dragged a</p>
<p>shotgun around from the days when he wore knee pants, and his</p>
<p>keen observing eyes and knowledge of the habits of wild life were</p>
<p>a revelation to Billy. This part of the country was too settled</p>
<p>for large game, but Billy kept Saxon supplied with squirrels and</p>
<p>quail, cottontails and jackrabbits, snipe and wild ducks. And</p>
<p>they learned to eat roasted mallard and canvasback in the</p>
<p>California style of sixteen minutes in a hot oven. As he became</p>
<p>expert with shotgun and rifle, he began to regret the deer and</p>
<p>the mountain lion he had missed down below the Sur; and to</p>
<p>the requirements of the farm he and Saxon sought he added plenty</p>
<p>of game.</p>
<p>But it was not all play in Carmel. That portion of the community</p>
<p>which Saxon and Billy came to know, &quot;the crowd,&quot; was</p>
<p>hard-working. Some worked regularly, in the morning or late at</p>
<p>night. Others worked spasmodically, like the wild Irish</p>
<p>playwright, who would shut himself up for a week at a time, then</p>
<p>emerge, pale and drawn, to play like a madman against the time of</p>
<p>his next retirement. The pale and youthful father of a family,</p>
<p>with the face of Shelley, who wrote vaudeville turns for a living</p>
<p>and blank verse tragedies and sonnet cycles for the despair of</p>
<p>managers and publishers, hid himself in a concrete cell with</p>
<p>three-foot walls, so piped, that, by turning a lever, the whole</p>
<p>structure spouted water upon the impending intruder. But in the</p>
<p>main, they respected each other&#x27;s work-time. They drifted into</p>
<p>one another&#x27;s houses as the spirit prompted, but if they found a</p>
<p>man at work they went their way. This obtained to all except Mark</p>
<p>Hall, who did not have to work for a living; and he climbed trees</p>
<p>to get away from popularity and compose in peace.</p>
<p>The crowd was unique in its democracy and solidarity. It had</p>
<p>little intercourse with the sober and conventional part of</p>
<p>Carmel. This section constituted the aristocracy of art and</p>
<p>letters, and was sneered at as bourgeois. In return, it looked</p>
<p>askance at the crowd with its rampant bohemianism. The taboo</p>
<p>extended to Billy and Saxon. Billy took up the attitude of the</p>
<p>clan and sought no work from the other camp. Nor was work offered</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>Hall kept open house. The big living room, with its huge</p>
<p>fireplace, divans, shelves and tables of books and magazines, was</p>
<p>the center of things. Here, Billy and Saxon were expected to be,</p>
<p>and in truth found themselves to be, as much at home as anybody.</p>
<p>Here, when wordy discussions on all subjects under the sun were</p>
<p>not being waged, Billy played at cut-throat Pedro, horrible</p>
<p>fives, bridge, and pinochle. Saxon, a favorite of the young</p>
<p>women, sewed with them, teaching them pretties and being taught</p>
<p>in fair measure in return.</p>
<p>It was Billy, before they had been in Carmel a week, who said</p>
<p>shyly to Saxon:</p>
<p>&quot;Say, you can&#x27;t guess how I&#x27;m missin&#x27; all your nice things.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s the matter with writin&#x27; Tom to express &#x27;m down? When we</p>
<p>start trampin&#x27; again, we&#x27;ll express &#x27;m back.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon wrote the letter, and all that day her heart was singing.</p>
<p>Her man was still her lover. And there were in his eyes all the</p>
<p>old lights which had been blotted out during the nightmare period</p>
<p>of the strike.</p>
<p>&quot;Some pretty nifty skirts around here, but you&#x27;ve got &#x27;em all</p>
<p>beat, or I&#x27;m no judge,&quot; he told her. And again: &quot;Oh, I love you</p>
<p>to death anyway. But if them things ain&#x27;t shipped down there&#x27;ll</p>
<p>be a funeral.&quot;</p>
<p>Hall and his wife owned a pair of saddle horses which were kept</p>
<p>at the livery stable, and here Billy naturally gravitated. The</p>
<p>stable operated the stage and carried the mails between Carmel</p>
<p>and Monterey. Also, it rented out carriages and mountain wagons</p>
<p>that seated nine persons. With carriages and wagons a driver was</p>
<p>furnished The stable often found itself short a driver, and Billy</p>
<p>was quickly called upon. He became an extra man at the stable. He</p>
<p>received three dollars a day at such times, and drove many</p>
<p>parties around the Seventeen Mile Drive, up Carmel Valley, and</p>
<p>down the coast to the various points and beaches.</p>
<p>&quot;But they&#x27;re a pretty uppish sort, most of &#x27;em,&quot; he said to</p>
<p>Saxon, referring to the persons he drove. &quot;A1ways MISTER Roberts</p>
<p>this, an&#x27; MISTER Roberts that--all kinds of ceremony so as to</p>
<p>make me not forget they consider themselves better &#x27;n me. You</p>
<p>see, I ain&#x27;t exactly a servant, an&#x27; yet I ain&#x27;t good enough for</p>
<p>them. I&#x27;m the driver--something half way between a hired man and</p>
<p>a chauffeur. Huh! When they eat they give me my lunch off to one</p>
<p>side, or afterward. No family party like with Hall an&#x27; HIS kind.</p>
<p>An&#x27; that crowd to-day, why, they just naturally didn&#x27;t have no</p>
<p>lunch for me at all. After this, always, you make me up my own</p>
<p>lunch. I won&#x27;t be be holdin&#x27; to &#x27;em for nothin&#x27;, the damned</p>
<p>geezers. An&#x27; you&#x27;d a-died to seen one of &#x27;em try to give me a</p>
<p>tip. I didn&#x27;t say nothin&#x27;. I just looked at &#x27;m like I didn&#x27;t see</p>
<p>&#x27;m, an&#x27; turned away casual-like after a moment, leavin&#x27; him as</p>
<p>embarrassed as hell.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Billy enjoyed the driving, never more so than when</p>
<p>he held the reins, not of four plodding workhorses, but of four</p>
<p>fast driving animals, his foot on the powerful brake, and swung</p>
<p>around curves and along dizzy cliff-rims to a frightened chorus</p>
<p>of women passengers. And when it came to horse judgment and</p>
<p>treatment of sick and injured horses even the owner of the stable</p>
<p>yielded place to Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;I could get a regular job there any time,&quot; he boasted quietly to</p>
<p>Saxon. &quot;Why, the country&#x27;s just sproutin&#x27; with jobs for any so-so</p>
<p>sort of a fellow. I bet anything, right now, if I said to the</p>
<p>boss that I&#x27;d take sixty dollars an&#x27; work regular, he&#x27;d jump for</p>
<p>me. He&#x27;s hinted as much.--And, say! Are you onta the fact that</p>
<p>yours truly has learnt a new trade, Well he has. He could take a</p>
<p>job stage-drivin&#x27; anywheres. They drive six on some of the stages</p>
<p>up in Lake County. If we ever get there, I&#x27;ll get thick with some</p>
<p>driver, just to get the reins of six in my hands. An&#x27; I&#x27;ll have</p>
<p>you on the box beside me. Some goin&#x27; that! Some goin&#x27;!&quot;</p>
<p>Billy took little interest in the many discussions waged in</p>
<p>Hall&#x27;s big living room. &quot;Wind-chewin&#x27;,&quot; was his term for it. To</p>
<p>him it was so much good time wasted that might be employed at a</p>
<p>game of Pedro, or going swimming, or wrestling in the sand.</p>
<p>Saxon, on the contrary, delighted in the logomachy, though little</p>
<p>enough she understood of it, following mainly by feeling, and</p>
<p>once in a while catching a high light.</p>
<p>But what she could never comprehend was the pessimism that so</p>
<p>often cropped up. The wild Irish playwright had terrible spells</p>
<p>of depression. Shelley, who wrote vaudeville turns in the</p>
<p>concrete cell, was a chronic pessimist. St. John, a young</p>
<p>magazine writer, was an anarchic disciple of Nietzsche. Masson, a</p>
<p>painter, held to a doctrine of eternal recurrence that was</p>
<p>petrifying. And Hall, usually so merry, could outfoot them all</p>
<p>when he once got started on the cosmic pathos of religion and the</p>
<p>gibbering anthropomorphisms of those who loved not to die. At</p>
<p>such times Saxon was oppressed by these sad children of art. It</p>
<p>was inconceivable that they, of all people, should be so forlorn.</p>
<p>One night Hall turned suddenly upon Billy, who had been following</p>
<p>dimly and who only comprehended that to them everything in life</p>
<p>was rotten and wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, you pagan, you, you stolid and flesh-fettered ox, you</p>
<p>monstrosity of over-weening and perennial health and joy, what do</p>
<p>you think of it?&quot; Hall demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I&#x27;ve had my troubles,&quot; Billy answered, speaking in his</p>
<p>wonted slow way. &quot;I&#x27;ve had my hard times, an&#x27; fought a losin&#x27;</p>
<p>strike, an&#x27; soaked my watch, an&#x27; ben unable to pay my rent or</p>
<p>buy grub, an&#x27; slugged scabs, an&#x27; ben slugged, and ben thrown</p>
<p>into jail for makin&#x27; a fool of myself. If I get you, I&#x27;d be a</p>
<p>whole lot better to be a swell hog fattenin&#x27; for market an&#x27;</p>
<p>nothin&#x27; worryin&#x27;, than to be a guy sick to his stomach from not</p>
<p>savvyin&#x27; how the world is made or from wonderin&#x27; what&#x27;s the good</p>
<p>of anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s good, that prize hog,&quot; the poet laughed. &quot;Least</p>
<p>irritation, least effort--a compromise of Nirvana and life.</p>
<p>Least irritation, least effort, the ideal existence: a jellyfish</p>
<p>floating in a tideless, tepid, twilight sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you&#x27;re missin&#x27; all the good things,&quot; Billy objected.</p>
<p>&quot;Name them,&quot; came the challenge.</p>
<p>Billy was silent a moment. To him life seemed a large and</p>
<p>generous thing. He felt as if his arms ached from inability to</p>
<p>compass it all, and he began, haltingly at first, to put his</p>
<p>feeling into speech.</p>
<p>&quot;If you&#x27;d ever stood up in the ring an&#x27; out-gamed an&#x27; out-fought</p>
<p>a man as good as yourself for twenty rounds, you&#x27;d get what I&#x27;m</p>
<p>drivin&#x27; at. Jim Hazard an&#x27; I get it when we swim out through the</p>
<p>surf an&#x27; laugh in the teeth of the biggest breakers that ever</p>
<p>pounded the beach, an&#x27; when we come out from the shower, rubbed</p>
<p>down and dressed, our skin an&#x27; muscles like silk, our bodies an&#x27;</p>
<p>brains all a-tinglin&#x27; like silk....&quot;</p>
<p>He paused and gave up from sheer inability to express ideas that</p>
<p>were nebulous at best and that in reality were remembered</p>
<p>sensations.</p>
<p>&quot;Silk of the body, can you beat it?&quot; he concluded lamely, feeling</p>
<p>that he had failed to make his point, embarrassed by the circle</p>
<p>of listeners.</p>
<p>&quot;We know all that,&quot; Hall retorted. &quot;The lies of the flesh.</p>
<p>Afterward come rheumatism and diabetes. The wine of life is</p>
<p>heady, but all too quickly it turns to--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uric acid,&quot; interpolated the wild Irish playwright.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;s plenty more of the good things,&quot; Billy took up with a</p>
<p>sudden rush of words. &quot;Good things all the way up from juicy</p>
<p>porterhouse and the kind of coffee Mrs. Hall makes to...&quot; He</p>
<p>hesitated at what he was about to say, then took it at a plunge.</p>
<p>&quot;To a woman you can love an&#x27; that loves you. Just take a look at</p>
<p>Saxon there with the ukulele in her lap. There&#x27;s where I got the</p>
<p>jellyfish in the dishwater an&#x27; the prize hog skinned to death.&quot;</p>
<p>A shout of applause and great hand-clapping went up from the</p>
<p>girls, and Billy looked painfully uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&quot;But suppose the silk goes out of your body till you creak like a</p>
<p>rusty wheelbarrow?&quot; Hall pursued. &quot;Suppose, just suppose, Saxon</p>
<p>went away with another man. What then?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy considered a space.</p>
<p>&quot;Then it&#x27;d be me for the dishwater an&#x27; the jellyfish, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>He straightened up in his chair and threw back his shoulders</p>
<p>unconsciously as he ran a hand over his biceps and swelled it.</p>
<p>Then he took another look at Saxon. &quot;But thank the Lord I still</p>
<p>got a wallop in both my arms an&#x27; a wife to fill &#x27;em with love.&quot;</p>
<p>Again the girls applauded, and Mrs. Hall cried:</p>
<p>&quot;Look at Saxon! She blushing! What have you to say for yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That no woman could be happier,&quot; she stammered, &quot;and no queen as</p>
<p>proud. And that--&quot;</p>
<p>She completed the thought by strumming on the ukulele and</p>
<p>singing:</p>
<p>&quot;De Lawd move in or mischievous way</p>
<p>His blunders to perform.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I give you best,&quot; Hall grinned to Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I don&#x27;t know,&quot; Billy disclaimed modestly. &quot;You&#x27;ve read so</p>
<p>much I guess you know more about everything than I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; &quot;Traitor!&quot; &quot;Taking it all back!&quot; the girls cried</p>
<p>variously.</p>
<p>Billy took heart of courage, reassured them with a slow smile,</p>
<p>and said:</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same I&#x27;d sooner be myself than have book indigestion.</p>
<p>An&#x27; as for Saxon, why, one kiss of her lips is worth more&#x27;n all</p>
<p>the libraries in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER X</p>
<p>&quot;There be hills and valleys, and rich land, and streams of clear</p>
<p>water, good wagon roads and a railroad not too far away, plenty</p>
<p>of sunshine, and cold enough at night to need blankets, and not</p>
<p>only pines but plenty of other kinds of trees, with open spaces</p>
<p>to pasture Billy&#x27;s horses and cattle, and deer and rabbits for</p>
<p>him to shoot, and lots and lots of redwood trees, and . . . and .</p>
<p>. . well, and no fog,&quot; Saxon concluded the description of the</p>
<p>farm she and Billy sought.</p>
<p>Mark Hall laughed delightedly.</p>
<p>&quot;And nightingales roosting in all the trees,&quot; he cried; &quot;flowers</p>
<p>that neither fail nor fade, bees without stings, honey dew every</p>
<p>morning, showers of manna betweenwhiles, fountains of youth and</p>
<p>quarries of philosopher&#x27;s stones--why, I know the very place. Let</p>
<p>me show you.&quot;</p>
<p>She waited while he pored over road-maps of the state. Failing in</p>
<p>them, he got out a big atlas, and, though. all the countries of</p>
<p>the world were in it, he could not find what he was after.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind,&quot; he said. &quot;Come over to-night and I&#x27;ll be able to</p>
<p>show you.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening he led her out on the veranda to the telescope, and</p>
<p>she found herself looking through it at the full moon.</p>
<p>&quot;Somewhere up there in some valley you&#x27;ll find that farm,&quot; he</p>
<p>teased.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall looked inquiringly at them as they returned inside.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve been showing her a valley in the moon where she expects to</p>
<p>go farming,&quot; he laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;We started out prepared to go any distance,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;And if</p>
<p>it&#x27;s to the moon, I expect we can make it.&quot; 412</p>
<p>THE VAI`I,EY OF THE MOON 413</p>
<p>&quot;But my dear child, you can&#x27;t expect to find such a paradise on</p>
<p>the earth,&quot; Hall continued. &quot;For instance, you can&#x27;t have</p>
<p>redwoods without fog. They go together. The redwoods grow only in</p>
<p>the fog belt.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon debated a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we could put up with a little fog,&quot; she conceded, &quot;--</p>
<p>almost anything to have redwoods. I don&#x27;t know what a quarry of</p>
<p>philosopher&#x27;s stones is like, but if it&#x27;s anything like Mr.</p>
<p>Hafier&#x27;s marble quarry, and there&#x27;s a railroad handy, I guess we</p>
<p>could manage to worry along. And you don&#x27;t have to go to the moon</p>
<p>for honey dew. They scrape it off of the leaves of the bushes up</p>
<p>in Nevada County. I know that for a fact, because my father told</p>
<p>my-mother about it, and she told me.&quot;</p>
<p>A little later in the evening, the subject of farming having</p>
<p>remained uppermost, Hall swept off into a diatribe against the</p>
<p>&quot;gambler&#x27;s paradise,&quot; which was his epithet for the United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>&quot;When you think of the glorious chance,&quot; he said. &quot;A new country,</p>
<p>bounded by the oceans, situated just right in latitude, with the</p>
<p>richest land and vastest natural resources of any country in the</p>
<p>world, settled by immigrants who had thrown off all the leading</p>
<p>strings of the Old World and were in the humor for democracy.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to stop them from perfecting the</p>
<p>democracy they started, and that thing was greediness.</p>
<p>&quot;They started gobbling everything in sight like a lot of swine,</p>
<p>and while they gobbled democracy went to smash. Gobbling became</p>
<p>gambling. It was a nation of tin horns. Whenever a man lost his</p>
<p>stake, all he had to do was to chase the frontier west a few</p>
<p>miles and get another stake. They moved over the face of the land</p>
<p>like so many locusts. They destroyed everything--the Indians, the</p>
<p>soil, the forests, just as they destroyed the buffalo and the</p>
<p>passenger pigeon. Their morality in business and politics was</p>
<p>gambler morality. Their laws were gambling laws--how to play the</p>
<p>game. Everybody played. Therefore, hurrah for the game. Nobody</p>
<p>objected, because nobody was unable to play. As I said, the</p>
<p>losers chased the frontier for fresh stakes. The winner of</p>
<p>to-day, broke to-morrow, on the day following might be riding his</p>
<p>luck to royal flushes on five-card draws.</p>
<p>&quot;So they gobbled and gambled from the Atlantic to the Pacific,</p>
<p>until they&#x27;d swined a whole continent. When they&#x27;d finished with</p>
<p>the lands and forests and mines, they turned back, gambling for</p>
<p>any little stakes they&#x27;d overlooked, gambling for franchises and</p>
<p>monopolies, using politics to protect their crooked deals and</p>
<p>brace games. And democracy gone clean to smash.</p>
<p>&quot;And then was the funniest time of all. The losers couldn&#x27;t get</p>
<p>any more stakes, while the winners went on gambling among</p>
<p>themselves. The losers could only stand around with their hands</p>
<p>in their pockets and look on. When they got hungry, they went,</p>
<p>hat in hand, and begged the successful gamblers for a job. The</p>
<p>losers went to work for the winners, and they&#x27;ve been working for</p>
<p>them ever since, and democracy side-tracked up Salt Creek. You,</p>
<p>Billy Roberts, have never had a hand in the game in your life.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s because your people were among the also-rans. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about yourself?&quot; Billy asked. &quot;I ain&#x27;t seen you holdin&#x27; any</p>
<p>hands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t have to. I don&#x27;t count. I am a parasite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A flea, a woodtick, anything that gets something for nothing. I</p>
<p>batten on the mangy hides of the workingmen. I don&#x27;t have to</p>
<p>gamble. I don&#x27;t have to work. My father left me enough of his</p>
<p>winnings.--Oh, don&#x27;t preen yourself, my boy. Your folks were just</p>
<p>as bad as mine. But yours lost, and mine won, and so you plow in</p>
<p>my potato patch. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t see it,&quot; Billy contended stoutly. &quot;A man with gumption</p>
<p>can win out to-day--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On government land?&quot; Hall asked quickly.</p>
<p>Billy swallowed and acknowledged the stab.</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same he can win out,&quot; he reiterated.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely--he can win a job from some other fellow? A young husky</p>
<p>with a good head like yours can win jobs anywhere. But think of</p>
<p>the handicaps on the fellows who lose. How many tramps have you</p>
<p>met along the road who could get a job driving four horses for</p>
<p>the Carmel Livery Stabler And some of them were as husky as you</p>
<p>when they were young. And on top of it all you&#x27;ve got no shout</p>
<p>coming. It&#x27;s a mighty big come-down from gambling for a continent</p>
<p>to gambling for a job.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just the same--&quot; Billy recommenced.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you&#x27;ve got it in your blood,&quot; Hall cut him off cavalierly.</p>
<p>&quot;And why not? Everybody in this country has been gambling for</p>
<p>generations. It was in the air when you were born. You&#x27;ve</p>
<p>breathed it all your life. You, who &#x27;ve never had a white chip in</p>
<p>the game, still go on shouting for it and capping for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what are all of us losers to do?&quot; Saxon inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Call in the police and stop the game,&quot; Hall recommended. &quot;It&#x27;s</p>
<p>crooked.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon frowned.</p>
<p>&quot;Do what your forefathers didn&#x27;t do,&quot; he amplified. &quot;Go ahead and</p>
<p>perfect democracy.&quot;</p>
<p>She remembered a remark of Mercedes.  &quot;A friend of mine says that</p>
<p>democracy is an enchantment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is--in a gambling joint. There are a million boys in our</p>
<p>public schools right now swallowing the gump of canal boy to</p>
<p>President, and millions of worthy citizens who sleep sound every</p>
<p>night in the belief that they have a say in running the country.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You talk like my brother Tom,&quot; Saxon said, failing to</p>
<p>comprehend. &quot;If we all get into politics and work hard for</p>
<p>something better maybe we&#x27;ll get it after a thousand years or so.</p>
<p>But I want it now.&quot; She clenched her hands passionately. &quot;I can&#x27;t</p>
<p>wait; I want it now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that is just what I&#x27;ve been telling you, my dear girl.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s the trouble with all the losers. They can&#x27;t wait.</p>
<p>They want it now--a stack of chips and a fling at the game. Well,</p>
<p>they won&#x27;t get it now. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s the matter with you, chasing</p>
<p>a valley in the moon. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s the matter with Billy, aching</p>
<p>right now for a chance to win ten cents from me at Pedro cussing</p>
<p>wind-chewing under his breath.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee! you&#x27;d make a good soap-boxer,&quot; commented Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#x27;d be a soap-boxer if I didn&#x27;t have the spending of my</p>
<p>father&#x27;s ill-gotten gains. It&#x27;s none of my affair. Islet them</p>
<p>rot. They&#x27;d be just as bad if they were on top. It&#x27;s all a</p>
<p>mess--blind bats, hungry swine, and filthy buzzards--&quot;</p>
<p>Here Mrs. Hall interferred.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Mark, you stop that, or you&#x27;ll be getting the blues.&quot;</p>
<p>He tossed his mop of hair and laughed with an effort.</p>
<p>&quot;No I won&#x27;t,&quot; he denied. &quot;I&#x27;m going to get ten cents from Billy</p>
<p>at a game of Pedro. He won&#x27;t have a look in.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon and Billy flourished in the genial human atmosphere of</p>
<p>Carmel. They appreciated in their own estimation. Saxon felt that</p>
<p>she was something more than a laundry girl and the wife of a</p>
<p>union teamster. She was no longer pent in the narrow working</p>
<p>class environment of a Pine street neighborhood. Life had grown</p>
<p>opulent. They fared better physically, materially, and</p>
<p>spiritually; and all this was reflected in their features, in the</p>
<p>carriage of their bodies. She knew Billy had never been handsomer</p>
<p>nor in more splendid bodily condition. He swore he had a harem,</p>
<p>and that she was his second wife-- twice as beautiful as the</p>
<p>first one he had married. And she demurely confessed to him that</p>
<p>Mrs. Hall and several others of the matrons had enthusiastically</p>
<p>admired her form one day when in for a cold dip in Carmel river.</p>
<p>They had got around her, and called her Venus, and made her</p>
<p>crouch and assume different poses.</p>
<p>Billy understood the Venus reference; for a marble one, with</p>
<p>broken arms, stood in Hall&#x27;s living room, and the poet had told</p>
<p>him the world worshiped it as the perfection of female form.</p>
<p>&quot;I always said you had Annette Kellerman beat a mile,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>said; and so proud was his air of possession that Saxon blushed</p>
<p>and trembled, and hid her hot face against his breast.</p>
<p>The men in the crowd were open in their admiration of Saxon, in</p>
<p>an above-board manner. But she made no mistake. She did not lose</p>
<p>her head. There was no chance of that, for her love for Billy</p>
<p>beat more strongly than ever. Nor was she guilty of</p>
<p>over-appraisal. She knew him for what he was, and loved him with</p>
<p>open eyes. He had no book learning, no art, like the other men.</p>
<p>His grammar was bad; she knew that, just as she knew that he</p>
<p>would never mend it. Yet she would not have exchanged him for any</p>
<p>of the others, not even for Mark Hall with the princely heart</p>
<p>whom she loved much in the same way that she loved his wife.</p>
<p>For that matter, she found in Billy a certain health and</p>
<p>rightness, a certain essential integrity, which she prized more</p>
<p>highly than all book learning and bank accounts. It was by virtue</p>
<p>of this health, and rightness, and integrity, that he had beaten</p>
<p>Hall in argument the night the poet was on the pessimistic</p>
<p>rampage. Billy had beaten him, not with the weapons of learning,</p>
<p>but just by being himself and by speaking out the truth that was</p>
<p>in him. Best of all, he had not even known that he had beaten,</p>
<p>and had taken the applause as good-natured banter. But Saxon</p>
<p>knew, though she could scarcely tell why; and she would always</p>
<p>remember how the wife of Shelley had whispered to her afterward</p>
<p>with shining eyes: &quot;Oh, Saxon, you must be so happy.&quot;</p>
<p>Were Saxon driven to speech to attempt to express what Billy</p>
<p>meant to her, she would have done it with the simple word &quot;man.&quot;</p>
<p>Always he was that to her. Always in glowing splendor, that was</p>
<p>his connotation--MAN. Sometimes, by herself, she would all but</p>
<p>weep with joy at recollection of his way of informing some</p>
<p>truculent male that he was standing on his foot. &quot;Get off your</p>
<p>foot. You&#x27;re standin&#x27; on it.&quot; It was Billy! It was magnificently</p>
<p>Billy. And it was this Billy who loved her. She knew it. She knew</p>
<p>it by the pulse that only a woman knows how to gauge. He loved</p>
<p>her less wildly, it was true; but more fondly, more maturely. It</p>
<p>was the love that lasted--if only they did not go back to the</p>
<p>city where the beautiful things of the spirit perished and the</p>
<p>beast bared its fangs.</p>
<p>In the early spring, Mark Hall and his wife went to New York, the</p>
<p>two Japanese servants of the bungalow were dismissed, and Saxon</p>
<p>and Billy were installed as caretakers. Jim Hazard, too, departed</p>
<p>on his yearly visit to Paris; and though Billy missed him, he</p>
<p>continued his long swims out through the breakers. Hall&#x27;s two</p>
<p>saddle horses had been left in his charge, and Saxon made herself</p>
<p>a pretty cross-saddle riding costume of tawny-brown corduroy that</p>
<p>matched the glints in her hair. Billy no longer worked at odd</p>
<p>jobs. As extra driver at the stable he earned more than they</p>
<p>spent, and, in preference to cash, he taught Saxon to ride, and</p>
<p>was out and away with her over the country on all-day trips. A</p>
<p>favorite ride was around by the coast to Monterey, where he</p>
<p>taught her to swim in the big Del Monte tank. They would come</p>
<p>home in the evening across the hills. Also, she took to following</p>
<p>him on his early morning hunts, and life seemed one long</p>
<p>vacation.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you one thing,&quot; he said to Saxon, one day, as they</p>
<p>drew their horses to a halt and gazed down into Carmel Valley. &quot;I</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t never going to work steady for another man for wages as</p>
<p>long as I live.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Work isn&#x27;t everything,&quot; she acknowledged.</p>
<p>&quot;I should guess not. Why, look here, Saxon, what&#x27;d it mean if I</p>
<p>worked teamin&#x27; in Oakland for a million dollars a day for a</p>
<p>million years and just had to go on stayin&#x27; there an&#x27; livin&#x27; the</p>
<p>way we used to? It&#x27;d mean work all day, three squares, an&#x27; movie&#x27;</p>
<p>pictures for recreation. Movin&#x27; pictures! Huh! We&#x27;re livin&#x27;</p>
<p>movie&#x27; pictures these days. I&#x27;d sooner have one year like what</p>
<p>we&#x27;re havin&#x27; here in Carmel and then die, than a thousan&#x27; million</p>
<p>years like on Pine street.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon had warned the Halls by letter that she and Billy intended</p>
<p>starting on their search for the valley in the moon as soon as</p>
<p>the first of summer arrived. Fortunately, the poet was put to no</p>
<p>inconvenience, for Bideaux, the Iron Man with the basilisk eyes,</p>
<p>had abandoned his dreams of priesthood and decided to become an</p>
<p>actor. He arrived at Carmel from the Catholic college in time to</p>
<p>take charge of the bungalow.</p>
<p>Much to Saxon&#x27;s gratification, the crowd was loth to see them</p>
<p>depart. The owner of the Carmel stable offered to put Billy in</p>
<p>charge at ninety dollars a month. Also, he received a similar</p>
<p>offer from the stable in Pacific Grove.</p>
<p>&quot;Whither away,&quot; the wild Irish playwright hailed them on the</p>
<p>station platform at Monterey. He was just returning from New</p>
<p>York.</p>
<p>&quot;To a valley in the moon,&quot; Saxon answered gaily.</p>
<p>He regarded their business-like packs.</p>
<p>&quot;By George!&quot; he cried. &quot;I&#x27;ll do it! By George! Let me come</p>
<p>along.&quot; Then his face fell. &quot;And I&#x27;ve signed the contract,&quot; he</p>
<p>groaned. &quot;Three acts! Say, you&#x27;re lucky. And this time of year,</p>
<p>too.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI</p>
<p>&quot;We hiked into Monterey last winter, but we&#x27;re ridin&#x27; out now, b</p>
<p>&#x27;gosh!&quot; Billy said as the train pulled out and they leaned back</p>
<p>in their seats.</p>
<p>They had decided against retracing their steps over the ground</p>
<p>already traveled, and took the train to San Francisco. They had</p>
<p>been warned by Mark Hall of the enervation of the south, and were</p>
<p>bound north for their blanket climate. Their intention was to</p>
<p>cross the Bay to Sausalito and wander up through the coast</p>
<p>counties Here, Hall had told them, they would find the true home</p>
<p>of the redwood. But Billy, in the smoking car for a cigarette,</p>
<p>seated himself beside a man who was destined to deflect them from</p>
<p>their course. He was a keen-faced, dark-eyed man, undoubtedly a</p>
<p>Jew; and Billy, remembering Saxon&#x27;s admonition always to ask</p>
<p>questions, watched his opportunity and started a conversation. It</p>
<p>took but a little while to learn that Gunston was a commission</p>
<p>merchant, and to realize that the content of his talk was too</p>
<p>valuable for Saxon to lose. Promptly, when he saw that the</p>
<p>other&#x27;s cigar was finished, Billy invited him into the next car</p>
<p>to meet Saxon. Billy would have been incapable of such an act</p>
<p>prior to his sojourn in Carmel. That much at least he had</p>
<p>acquired of social facility.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s just teen tellin&#x27; me about the potato kings, and I wanted</p>
<p>him to tell you,&quot; Billy explained to Saxon after the</p>
<p>introduction. &quot;Go on and tell her, Mr. Gunston, about that fan</p>
<p>tan sucker that made nineteen thousan&#x27; last year in celery an&#x27;</p>
<p>asparagus.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was just telling your husband about the way the Chinese make</p>
<p>things go up the San Joaquin river. It would be worth your while</p>
<p>to go up there and look around. It&#x27;s the good season now--too</p>
<p>early for mosquitoes. You can get off the train at Black Diamond</p>
<p>or Antioch and travel around among the big farming islands on the</p>
<p>steamers and launches. The fares are cheap, and you&#x27;ll find some</p>
<p>of those big gasoline boats, like the Duchess and Princess, more</p>
<p>like big steamboats.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell her about Chow Lam,&quot; Billy urged.</p>
<p>The commission merchant leaned back and laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Chow Lam, several years ago, was a broken-down fan tan player.</p>
<p>He hadn&#x27;t a cent, and his health was going back on him. He had</p>
<p>worn out his back with twenty years&#x27; work in the gold mines,</p>
<p>washing over the tailings of the early miners. And whatever he&#x27;d</p>
<p>made he&#x27;d lost at gambling. Also, he was in debt three hundred</p>
<p>dollars to the Six Companies--you know, they&#x27;re Chinese affairs.</p>
<p>And, remember, this was only seven years ago--health breaking</p>
<p>down, three hundred in debt, and no trade. Chow Lam blew into</p>
<p>Stockton and got a job on the peat lands at day&#x27;s wages. It was a</p>
<p>Chinese company, down on Middle River, that farmed celery and</p>
<p>asparagus. This was when he got onto himself and took stock of</p>
<p>himself. A quarter of a century in the United States, back not so</p>
<p>strong as it used to was, and not a penny laid by for his return</p>
<p>to China. He saw how the Chinese in the company had done</p>
<p>it--saved their wages and bought a share.</p>
<p>&quot;He saved his wages for two years, and bought one share in a</p>
<p>thirty-share company. That was only five years ago. They leased</p>
<p>three hundred acres of peat land from a white man who preferred</p>
<p>traveling in Europe. Out of the profits of that one share in the</p>
<p>first year, he bought two shares in another company. And in a</p>
<p>year more, out of the three shares, he organized a company of his</p>
<p>own. One year of this, with bad luck, and he just broke even.</p>
<p>That brings it up to three years ago. The following year, bumper</p>
<p>crops, he netted four thousand. The next year it wan five</p>
<p>thousand. And last year he cleaned up nineteen thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Pretty good, eh, for old broken-down Chow Lam?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My!&quot; was all Saxon could say.</p>
<p>Her eager interest, however, incited the commission merchant to</p>
<p>go on.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at Sing Kee--the Potato King of Stockton. I know him well.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had more large deals with him and made less money than with</p>
<p>any man I know. He was only a coolie, and he smuggled himself</p>
<p>into the United States twenty years ago. Started at day&#x27;s wages,</p>
<p>then peddled vegetables in a couple of baskets slung on a stick,</p>
<p>and after that opened up a store in Chinatown in San Francisco.</p>
<p>But he had a head on him, and he was soon onto the curves of the</p>
<p>Chinese farmers that dealt at his store. The store couldn&#x27;t make</p>
<p>money fast enough to suit him. He headed up the San Joaquin.</p>
<p>Didn&#x27;t do much for a couple of years except keep his eyes peeled.</p>
<p>Then he jumped in and leased twelve hundred acres at seven</p>
<p>dollars an acre &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My God!&quot; Billy said in an awe-struck voice. &quot;Eight thousan&#x27;,</p>
<p>four hundred dollars just for rent the first year. I know five</p>
<p>hundred acres I can buy for three dollars an acre.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will it grow potatoes?&quot; Gunston asked.</p>
<p>Billy shook his head. &quot;Nor nothin&#x27; else, I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>All three laughed heartily and the commission merchant resumed:</p>
<p>&quot;That seven dollars was only for the land. Possibly you know what</p>
<p>it costs to plow twelve hundred acres?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>&quot;And he got a hundred and sixty sacks to the acre that year,&quot;</p>
<p>Gunston continued. &quot;Potatoes were selling at fifty cents. My</p>
<p>father was at the head of our concern at the time, so I know for</p>
<p>a fact. And Sing Kee could have sold at fifty cents and made</p>
<p>money. But did he? Trust a Chinaman to know the market. They can</p>
<p>skin the commission merchants at it. Sing Kee held on. When &#x27;most</p>
<p>everybody else had sold, potatoes began to climb. He laughed at</p>
<p>our buyers when we offered him sixty cents, seventy cents, a</p>
<p>dollar. Do you want to know what he finally did sell for? One</p>
<p>dollar and sixty-five a sack. Suppose they actually cost him</p>
<p>forty cents. A hundred and sixty times twelve hundred . . . let</p>
<p>me see . . . twelve times nought is nought and twelve times</p>
<p>sixteen is a hundred and ninety-two . . . a hundred and</p>
<p>ninety-two thousand sacks at a dollar and a quarter net...four</p>
<p>into a hundred and ninety-two is forty-eight, plus, is two</p>
<p>hundred and forty--there you are, two hundred and forty thousand</p>
<p>dollars clear profit on that year&#x27;s deal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; him a Chink,&quot; Billy mourned disconsolately. He turned to</p>
<p>Saxon. &quot;They ought to be some new country for us white folks to</p>
<p>go to. Gosh!--we&#x27;re settin&#x27; on the stoop all right, all right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, of course, that was unusual,&quot; Glunston hastened to qualify.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a failure of potatoes in other districts, and a</p>
<p>corner, and in some strange way Sing Kee was dead on. He never</p>
<p>made profits like that again. But he goes ahead steadily. Last</p>
<p>year he had four thousand acres in potatoes, a thousand in</p>
<p>asparagus, five hundred in celery and five hundred in beans. And</p>
<p>he&#x27;s running six hundred acres in seeds. No matter what happens</p>
<p>to one or two crops, he can&#x27;t lose on all of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve seen twelve thousand acres of apple trees,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>&quot;And I&#x27;d like to see four thousand acres in potatoes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And we will,&quot; Billy rejoined with great positiveness. &quot;It&#x27;s us</p>
<p>for the San Joaquin. We don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in our country. No</p>
<p>wonder we&#x27;re out on the stoop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll find lots of kings up there,&quot; Gunston related. &quot;Yep Hong</p>
<p>Lee--they call him &#x27;Big Jim,&#x27; and Ah Pock, and Ah Whang,</p>
<p>and--then there&#x27;s Shima, the Japanese potato king. He&#x27;s worth</p>
<p>several millions. Lives like a prince.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why don&#x27;t Americans succeed like that?&quot; asked Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Because they won&#x27;t, I guess. There&#x27;s nothing to stop them except</p>
<p>themselves. I&#x27;ll tell you one thing, though-- give me the Chinese</p>
<p>to deal with. He&#x27;s honest. His word is as good as his bond. If he</p>
<p>says he&#x27;ll do a thing, he&#x27;ll do it. And, anyway, the white man</p>
<p>doesn&#x27;t know how to farm. :EIven the up-to-date white farmer is</p>
<p>content with one crop at a time and rotation of crops. Mr. John</p>
<p>Chinaman goes him one better, and grows two crops at one time on</p>
<p>the same soil. I&#x27;ve seen it--radishes and carrots, two crops,</p>
<p>sown at one time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which don&#x27;t stand to reason,&quot; Billy objected. &quot;They&#x27;d be only a</p>
<p>half crop of each.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Another guess coming,&quot; Gunston jeered. &quot;Carrots have to be</p>
<p>thinned when they&#x27;re so far along. So do radishes. But carrots</p>
<p>grow slow. Radishes grow fast. The slow-going carrots serve the</p>
<p>purpose of thinning the radishes. And when the radishes are</p>
<p>pulled, ready for market, that thins the carrots, which come</p>
<p>along later. You can&#x27;t beat the Chink.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t see why a white man can&#x27;t do what a Chink can,&quot; protested</p>
<p>Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds all right,&quot; Gunston replied. &quot;The only objection is</p>
<p>that the white man doesn&#x27;t. The Chink is busy all the time, and</p>
<p>he keeps the ground just as busy. He has organization, system.</p>
<p>Who ever heard of white farmers keeping books? The Chink does. No</p>
<p>guess work with him. He knows just where he stands, to a cent, on</p>
<p>any crop at any moment. And he knows the market. He plays both</p>
<p>ends. How he does it is beyond me, but he knows the market better</p>
<p>than we commission merchants.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, again, he&#x27;s patient but not stubborn. Suppose he does make</p>
<p>a mistake, and gets in a crop, and then finds the market is</p>
<p>wrong. In such a situation the white man gets stubborn and hangs</p>
<p>on like a bulldog. But not the Chink. He&#x27;s going to minimize the</p>
<p>losses of that mistake. That land has got to work, and make</p>
<p>money. Without a quiver or a regret, the moment he&#x27;s learned his</p>
<p>error, he puts his plows into that crop, turns it under, and</p>
<p>plants something else. He has the savve. He can look at a sprout,</p>
<p>just poked up out of the ground, and tell how it&#x27;s going to turn</p>
<p>out--whether it will head up or won&#x27;t head up; or if it&#x27;s going</p>
<p>to head up good, medium, or bad. That&#x27;s one end. Take the other</p>
<p>end. He controls his crop. He forces it or holds it back. with an</p>
<p>eye on the market. And when the market is just right, there&#x27;s his</p>
<p>crop, ready to deliver, timed to the minute.&quot;</p>
<p>The conversation with Gunston lasted hours, and the more he</p>
<p>talked of the Chinese and their farming ways the more Saxon</p>
<p>became aware of a growing dissatisfaction. She did not question</p>
<p>the facts. The trouble was that they were not alluring. Somehow,</p>
<p>she could not find place for them in her valley of the moon. It</p>
<p>was not until the genial Jew left the train that Billy gave</p>
<p>definite statement to what was vaguely bothering her.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh! We ain&#x27;t Chinks. We&#x27;re white folks. Does a Chink ever want</p>
<p>to ride a horse, hell-bent for election an&#x27; havin&#x27; a good time of</p>
<p>it? Did you ever see a Chink go swimmin&#x27; out through the breakers</p>
<p>at Carmel?--or boxin&#x27;, wrestlin&#x27;, runnin&#x27; an&#x27; jumpin&#x27;for the</p>
<p>sport of it? Did you ever see a Chink take a shotgun on his arm,</p>
<p>tramp six miles, an&#x27; come back happy with one measly rabbit? What</p>
<p>does a Chink do? Work his damned head off. That&#x27;s all he&#x27;s good</p>
<p>for. To hell with work, if that&#x27;s the whole of the game--an&#x27; I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>done my share of work, an&#x27; I can work alongside of any of &#x27;em.</p>
<p>But what&#x27;s the good? If they&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned solid since</p>
<p>you an&#x27; me hit the road, Saxon, it is that work&#x27;s the least part</p>
<p>of life. God!--if it was all of life I couldn&#x27;t cut my throat</p>
<p>quick enough to get away from it. I want shotguns an&#x27; rifles, an&#x27;</p>
<p>a horse between my legs. I don&#x27;t want to be so tired all the time</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t love my wife. Who wants to be rich an&#x27; clear two hundred</p>
<p>an&#x27; forty thousand on a potato deal! Look at Rockefeller. Has to</p>
<p>live on milk. I want porterhouse and a stomach that can bite</p>
<p>sole-leather. An&#x27; I want you, an&#x27; plenty of time along with you,</p>
<p>an&#x27; fun for both of us. What&#x27;s the good of life if they ain&#x27;t no</p>
<p>fun?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Billy!&quot; Saxon cried. &quot;It&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve been trying to get</p>
<p>straightened out in my head. It&#x27;s been worrying me for ever so</p>
<p>long. I was afraid there was something wrong with me- -that I</p>
<p>wasn&#x27;t made for the country after all. All the time I didn&#x27;t envy</p>
<p>the San Leandro Portuguese. I didn&#x27;t want to be one, nor a Pajaro</p>
<p>Valley Dalmatian, nor even a Mrs. Mortimer. And you didn&#x27;t</p>
<p>either. What we want is a valley of the moon, with not too much</p>
<p>work, and all the fun we want. And we&#x27;ll just keep on looking</p>
<p>until we find it. And if we don&#x27;t find it, we&#x27;ll go on having the</p>
<p>fun just as we have ever since we left Oakland. And, Billy . . .</p>
<p>we&#x27;re never, never going to work our damned heads off, are we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not on your life, &quot; Billy growled in fierce affirmation.</p>
<p>They walked into Black Diamond with their packs on their backs.</p>
<p>It was a scattered village of shabby little cottages, with a main</p>
<p>street that was a wallow of black mud from the last late spring</p>
<p>rain. The sidewalks bumped up and down in uneven steps and</p>
<p>landings. Everything seemed un-American. The names on the strange</p>
<p>dingy shops were unspeakably foreign. The one dingy hotel was run</p>
<p>by a Greek. Greeks were everywhere--swarthy men in sea-boots and</p>
<p>tam-o&#x27;-shanters, hatless women in bright colors, hordes of sturdy</p>
<p>children, and all speaking in outlandish voices, crying shrilly</p>
<p>and vivaciously with the volubility of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!--this ain&#x27;t the United States,&quot; Billy muttered. Down on the</p>
<p>water front they found a fish cannery and an asparagus cannery in</p>
<p>the height of the busy season, where they looked in vain among</p>
<p>the toilers for familiar American faces. Billy picked out the</p>
<p>bookkeepers and foremen for Americans. All the rest were Greeks,</p>
<p>Italians, and Chinese.</p>
<p>At the steamboat wharf, they watched the bright-painted Greek</p>
<p>boats arriving, discharging their loads of glorious salmon, and</p>
<p>departing. New York Cut-Off, as the slough was called, curved to</p>
<p>the west and north and flowed into a vast body of water which was</p>
<p>the united Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.</p>
<p>Beyond the steamboat wharf, the fishing wharves dwindled to</p>
<p>stages for the drying of nets; and here, away from the noise and</p>
<p>clatter of the alien town, Saxon and Billy took off their packs</p>
<p>and rested. The tall, rustling tules grew out of the deep water</p>
<p>close to the dilapidated boat-landing where they sat. Opposite</p>
<p>the town lay a long flat island, on which a row of ragged poplars</p>
<p>leaned against the sky.</p>
<p>&quot;Just like in that Dutch windmill picture Mark Hall has,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>Billy pointed out the mouth of the slough and across the broad</p>
<p>reach of water to a cluster of tiny white buildings, behind</p>
<p>which, like a glimmering mirage, rolled the low Montezuma Hills.</p>
<p>&quot;Those houses is Collinsville,&quot; he informed her. &quot;The Sacramento</p>
<p>river comes in there, and you go up it to Rio Vista an&#x27; Isleton,</p>
<p>and Walnut Grove, and all those places Mr. Gunston was tellin&#x27; us</p>
<p>about. It&#x27;s all islands and sloughs, connectin&#x27; clear across an&#x27;</p>
<p>back to the San Joaquin. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t the sun good,&quot; Saxon yawned. &quot;And how quiet it is here, so</p>
<p>short a distance away from those strange foreigners. And to</p>
<p>think! in the cities, right now, men are beating and killing each</p>
<p>other for jobs.&quot;</p>
<p>Now and again an overland passenger train rushed by in the</p>
<p>distance, echoing along the background of foothills of Mt.</p>
<p>Diablo, which bulked, twin-peaked, greencrinkled, against the</p>
<p>sky. Then the slumbrous quiet would fall, to be broken by the far</p>
<p>call of a foreign tongue or by a gasoline fishing boat chugging</p>
<p>in through the mouth of the slough.</p>
<p>Not a hundred feet away, anchored close in the tules, lay a</p>
<p>beautiful white yacht. Despite its tininess, it looked broad and</p>
<p>comfortable. Smoke was rising for&#x27;ard from its stovepipe. On its</p>
<p>stern, in gold letters, they read Roamer. On top of the cabin,</p>
<p>basking in the sunshine, lay a man and woman, the latter with a</p>
<p>pink scarf around her head. The man was reading aloud from a</p>
<p>book, while she sewed. Beside them sprawled a fox terrier.</p>
<p>&quot;Gosh! they don&#x27;t have to stick around cities to be happy,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>commented.</p>
<p>A Japanese came on deck from the cabin, sat down for&#x27;ard, and</p>
<p>began picking a chicken. The feathers floated away in a long line</p>
<p>toward the mouth of the slough.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Look!&quot; Saxon pointed in her excitement. &quot;He&#x27;s fishing! And</p>
<p>the line is fast to his toe!&quot;</p>
<p>The man had dropped the book face-downward on the cabin and</p>
<p>reached for the line, while the woman looked up from her sewing,</p>
<p>and the terrier began to bark. In came the line, hand under hand,</p>
<p>and at the end a big catfish. When this was removed, and the line</p>
<p>rebaited and dropped overboard, the man took a turn around his</p>
<p>toe and went on reading.</p>
<p>A Japanese came down on the landing-stage beside Saxon and Billy,</p>
<p>and hailed the yacht. He carried parcels of meat and vegetables;</p>
<p>one coat pocket bulged with letters, the other with morning</p>
<p>papers. In response to his hail, the Japanese on the yacht stood</p>
<p>up with the part- plucked chicken. The man said something to him,</p>
<p>put aside the book, got into the white skiff lying astern, and</p>
<p>rowed to the landing. As he came alongside the stage, he pulled</p>
<p>in his oars, caught hold, and said good morning genially.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I know you,&quot; Saxon said impulsively, to Billy&#x27;s amazement.</p>
<p>&quot;You are....&quot;</p>
<p>Here she broke off in confusion.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; the man said, smiling reassurance.</p>
<p>&quot;You are Jack Hastings, I &#x27;m sure of it. I used to see your</p>
<p>photograph in the papers all the time you were war correspondent</p>
<p>in the Japanese-Russian War. You&#x27;ve written lots of books, though</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve never read them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right you are,&quot; he ratified. &quot;And what&#x27;s your name?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon introduced herself and Billy, and, when she noted the</p>
<p>writer&#x27;s observant eye on their packs, she sketched the</p>
<p>pilgrimage they were on. The farm in the valley of the moon</p>
<p>evidently caught his fancy, and, though the Japanese and his</p>
<p>parcels were safely in the skiff, Hastings still lingered. When</p>
<p>Saxon spoke of Carmel, he seemed to know everybody in Hall&#x27;s</p>
<p>crowd, and when he heard they were intending to go to Rio Vista,</p>
<p>his invitation was immediate.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, we&#x27;re going that way ourselves, inside an hour, as soon as</p>
<p>slack water comes,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;It&#x27;s just the thing. Come on</p>
<p>on board. We&#x27;ll be there by four this afternoon if there&#x27;s any</p>
<p>wind at all. Come on. My wife&#x27;s on board, and Mrs. Hall is one of</p>
<p>her best chums. We&#x27;ve been away to South America--just got back;</p>
<p>or you&#x27;d have seen us in Carmel. Hal wrote to us about the pair</p>
<p>of you.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the second time in her life that Saxon had been in a small</p>
<p>boat, and the Roamer was the first yacht she had ever been on</p>
<p>board. The writer&#x27;s wife, whom he called Clara, welcomed them</p>
<p>heartily, and Saxon lost no time in falling in love with her and</p>
<p>in being fallen in love with in return. So strikingly did they</p>
<p>resemble each other, that Hastings was not many minutes in</p>
<p>calling attention to it. He made them stand side by side, studied</p>
<p>their eyes and mouths and ears, compared their hands, their hair,</p>
<p>their ankles, and swore that his fondest dream was shattered--</p>
<p>namely, that when Clara had been made the mold was broken.</p>
<p>On Clara&#x27;s suggestion that it might have been pretty much the</p>
<p>same mold, they compared histories. Both were of the pioneer</p>
<p>stock. Clara&#x27;s mother, like Saxon&#x27;s, had crossed the Plains with</p>
<p>ox-teams, and, like Saxon&#x27;s, had wintered in Salt Intake City--in</p>
<p>fact, had, with her sisters, opened the first Gentile school in</p>
<p>that Mormon stronghold. And, if Saxon&#x27;s father had helped raise</p>
<p>the Bear Flag rebellion at Sonoma, it was at Sonoma that Clara&#x27;s</p>
<p>father had mustered in for the War of the Rebellion and ridden as</p>
<p>far east with his troop as Salt Lake City, of which place he had</p>
<p>been provost marshal when the Mormon trouble flared up. To</p>
<p>complete it all, Clara fetched from the cabin an ukulele of boa</p>
<p>wood that was the twin to Saxon&#x27;s, and together they sang</p>
<p>&quot;Honolulu Tomboy.&quot;</p>
<p>Hastings decided to eat dinner--he called the midday meal by its</p>
<p>old-fashioned name--before sailing; and down below Saxon was</p>
<p>surprised and delighted by the measure of comfort in so tiny a</p>
<p>cabin. There was just room for Billy to stand upright. A</p>
<p>centerboard-case divided the room in half longitudinally, and to</p>
<p>this was attached the hinged table from which they ate. Low bunks</p>
<p>that ran the full cabin length, upholstered in cheerful green,</p>
<p>served as seats. A curtain, easily attached by hooks between the</p>
<p>centerboard-case and the roof, at night screened Mrs. Hastings&#x27;</p>
<p>sleeping quarters. On the opposite side the two Japanese bunked,</p>
<p>while for&#x27;ard, under the deck, was the galley. So small was it</p>
<p>that there was just room beside it for the cook, who was</p>
<p>compelled by the low deck to squat on his hands. The other</p>
<p>Japanese, who had brought the parcels on board, waited on the</p>
<p>table.</p>
<p>&quot;They are looking for a ranch in the valley of the moon,&quot;</p>
<p>Hastings concluded his explanation of the pilgrimage to Clara.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!--don&#x27;t you know--&quot; she cried; but was silenced by her</p>
<p>husband.</p>
<p>&quot;Hush,&quot; he said peremptorily, then turned to their guests.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen. There&#x27;s something in that valley of the moon idea, but I</p>
<p>won&#x27;t tell you what. It is a secret. Now we&#x27;ve a ranch in Sonoma</p>
<p>Valley about eight miles from the very town of Sonoma where you</p>
<p>two girls&#x27; fathers took up soldiering; and if you ever come to</p>
<p>our ranch you&#x27;ll learn the secret. Oh, believe me, it&#x27;s connected</p>
<p>with your valley of the moon.--Isn&#x27;t it, Mate?&quot;</p>
<p>This last was the mutual name he and Clara had for each other.</p>
<p>She smiled and laughed and nodded her head.</p>
<p>&quot;You might find our valley the very one you are looking for,&quot; she</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>But Hastings shook his head at her to check further speech. She</p>
<p>turned to the fox terrier and made it speak for a piece of meat.</p>
<p>&quot;Her name&#x27;s Peggy,&quot; she told Saxon. &quot;We had two Irish terriers</p>
<p>down in the South Seas, brother and sister, but they died. We</p>
<p>called them Peggy and Possum. So she&#x27;s named after the original</p>
<p>Peggy.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy was impressed by the ease with which the Roamer was</p>
<p>operated. While they lingered at table, at a word from Hastings</p>
<p>the two Japanese had gone on deck. Billy could hear them throwing</p>
<p>down the halyards, casting off gaskets, and heaving the anchor</p>
<p>short on the tiny winch. In several minutes one called down that</p>
<p>everything was ready, and all went on deck. Hoisting mainsail and</p>
<p>jigger was a matter of minutes. Then the cook and cabin-boy broke</p>
<p>out anchor, and, while one hove it up, the other hoisted the jib.</p>
<p>Eastings, at the wheel, trimmed the sheet. The Roamer paid off,</p>
<p>filled her sails, slightly heeling, and slid across the smooth</p>
<p>water and out the mouth of New York Slough. The Japanese coiled</p>
<p>the halyards and went below for their own dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;The flood is just beginning to make,&quot; said Hastings, pointing to</p>
<p>a striped spar-buoy that was slightly tipping up-stream on the</p>
<p>edge of the channel.</p>
<p>The tiny white houses of Collinsville, which they were nearing,</p>
<p>disappeared behind a low island, though the Montezuma Hills, with</p>
<p>their long, low, restful lines, slumbered on the horizon</p>
<p>apparently as far away as ever.</p>
<p>As the Roamer passed the mouth of Montezuma Slough and entered</p>
<p>the Sacramento, they came upon Collinsville close at hand. Saxon</p>
<p>clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s like a lot of toy houses,&quot; she said, &quot;cut out of cardboard.</p>
<p>And those hilly fields are just painted up behind.&quot;</p>
<p>They passed many arks and houseboats of fishermen moored among</p>
<p>the tules, and the women and children, like the men in the boats,</p>
<p>were dark-skinned, black-eyed, foreign. As they proceeded up the</p>
<p>river, they began to encounter dredges at work, biting out</p>
<p>mouthfuls of the sandy river bottom and heaping it on top of the</p>
<p>huge levees. Great mats of willow brush, hundreds of yards in</p>
<p>length, were laid on top of the river-slope of the levees and</p>
<p>held in place by steel cables and thousands of cubes of cement.</p>
<p>The willows soon sprouted, Hastings told them, and by the time</p>
<p>the mats were rotted away the sand was held in place by the roots</p>
<p>of the trees.</p>
<p>&quot;It must cost like Sam Hill,&quot; Billy observed.</p>
<p>&quot;But the land is worth it,&quot; Hastings explained. &quot;This island land</p>
<p>is the most productive in the world. This section of California</p>
<p>is like Holland. You wouldn&#x27;t think it, but this water we&#x27;re</p>
<p>sailing on is higher than the surface of the islands. They&#x27;re</p>
<p>like leaky boats--calking, patching, pumping, night and day and</p>
<p>all the time. But it pays. It pays.&quot;</p>
<p>Except for the dredgers, the fresh-piled sand, the dense willow</p>
<p>thickets, and always Mt. Diablo to the south, nothing was to be</p>
<p>seen. Occasionally a river steamboat passed, and blue herons flew</p>
<p>into the trees.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be very lonely,&quot; Saxon remarked.</p>
<p>Hastings laughed and told her she would change her mind later.</p>
<p>Much he related to them of the river lands, and after a while he</p>
<p>got on the subject of tenant farming. Saxon had started him by</p>
<p>speaking of the land-hungry Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>&quot;Land-hogs,&quot; he snapped. &quot;That&#x27;s our record in this country. As</p>
<p>one old Reuben told a professor of an agricultural experiment</p>
<p>station: &#x27;They ain&#x27;t no sense in tryin&#x27; to teach me farmin&#x27;. I</p>
<p>know all about it. Ain&#x27;t I worked out three farms?&#x27; It was his</p>
<p>kind that destroyed New England. Back there great sections are</p>
<p>relapsing to wilderness. In one state, at least, the deer have</p>
<p>increased until they are a nuisance. There are abandoned farms by</p>
<p>the tens of thousands. I&#x27;ve gone over the lists of them--farms in</p>
<p>New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut. Offered for</p>
<p>sale on easy pay nent. The prices asked wouldn&#x27;t pay for the</p>
<p>improvements, while the land, of course, is thrown in for</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
<p>&quot;And the same thing is going on, in one way or another, the same</p>
<p>land-robbing and hogging, over the rest of the country--down in</p>
<p>Texas, in Missouri, and Kansas, out here in California. Take</p>
<p>tenant farming. I know a ranch in my county where the land was</p>
<p>worth a hundred and twenty-five an acre. And it gave its return</p>
<p>at that valuation. When the old man died, the son leased it to a</p>
<p>Portuguese and went to live in the city. In five years the</p>
<p>Portuguese skimmed the cream and dried up the udder. The second</p>
<p>lease, with another Portuguese for three years, gave one-quarter</p>
<p>the former return. No third Portuguese appeared to offer to lease</p>
<p>it. There wasn&#x27;t anything left. That ranch was worth fifty</p>
<p>thousand when the old man died. In the end the son got eleven</p>
<p>thousand for it. Why, I&#x27;ve seen land that paid twelve per cent.,</p>
<p>that, after the skimming of a five-years&#x27; lease, paid only one</p>
<p>and a quarter per cent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the same in our valley,&quot; Mrs. Hastings supplemented. &quot;All</p>
<p>the old farms are dropping into ruin. Take the Ebell Place,</p>
<p>Mate.&quot; Her husband nodded emphatic indorsement. &quot;When we used to</p>
<p>know it, it was a perfect paradise of a farm. There were dams and</p>
<p>lakes, beautiful meadows, lush hayfields, red hills of</p>
<p>grape-lands, hundreds of acres of good pasture, heavenly groves</p>
<p>of pines and oaks, a stone winery, stone barns, grounds--oh, I</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t describe it in hours. When Mrs. Bell died, the family</p>
<p>scattered, and the leasing began. It&#x27;s a ruin to-day. The trees</p>
<p>have been cut and sold for firewood. There&#x27;s only a little bit of</p>
<p>the vineyard that isn&#x27;t abandoned-- just enough to make wine for</p>
<p>the present Italian lessees, who are running a poverty-stricken</p>
<p>milk ranch on the leavings of the soil. I rode over it last year,</p>
<p>and cried. The beautiful orchard is a horror. The grounds have</p>
<p>gone back to the wild. Just because they didn&#x27;t keep the gutters</p>
<p>cleaned out, the rain trickled down and dry-rotted the timbers,</p>
<p>and the big stone barn is caved in. The same with part of the</p>
<p>winery--the other part is used for stabling the cows. And the</p>
<p>house!--words can&#x27;t describe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s become a profession,&quot; Hastings went on. &quot;The &#x27;movers.&#x27; They</p>
<p>lease, clean out and gut a place in several years, and then move</p>
<p>on. They&#x27;re not like the foreigners, the Chinese, and Japanese,</p>
<p>and the rest. In the main they&#x27;re a lazy, vagabond, poor-white</p>
<p>sort, who do nothing else but skin the soil and move, skin the</p>
<p>soil and move. Now take the Portuguese and Italians in our</p>
<p>country. They are different. They arrive in the country without a</p>
<p>penny and work for others of their countrymen until they&#x27;ve</p>
<p>learned the language and their way about. Now they&#x27;re not movers.</p>
<p>What they are after is land of their own, which they will love</p>
<p>and care for and conserve. But, in the meantime, how to get it?</p>
<p>Saving wages is slow. There is a quicker way. They lease. In</p>
<p>three years they can gut enough out of somebody else&#x27;s land to</p>
<p>set themselves up for life. It is sacrilege, a veritable rape of</p>
<p>the land; but what of it, It&#x27;s the way of the United States.&quot;</p>
<p>He turned suddenly on Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Roberts. You and your wife are looking for your bit</p>
<p>of land. You want it bad. Now take my advice. It&#x27;s cold, hard</p>
<p>advice. Become a tenant farmer. Lease some place, where the old</p>
<p>folks have died and the country isn&#x27;t good enough for the sons</p>
<p>and daughters. Then gut it. Wring the last dollar out of the</p>
<p>soil, repair nothing, and in three years you&#x27;ll have your own</p>
<p>place paid for. Then turn over a new leaf, and love your soil.</p>
<p>Nourish it. Every dollar you feed it will return you two. lend</p>
<p>have nothing scrub about the place. If it&#x27;s a horse, a cow, a</p>
<p>pig, a chicken, or a blackberry vine, see that it&#x27;s</p>
<p>thoroughbred.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s wicked!&quot; Saxon wrung out. &quot;It&#x27;s wicked advice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We live in a wicked age,&quot; Hastings countered, smiling grimly.</p>
<p>&quot;This wholesale land-skinning is the national crime of the United</p>
<p>States to-day. Nor would I give your husband such advice if I</p>
<p>weren&#x27;t absolutely certain that the land he skins would be</p>
<p>skinned by some Portuguese or Italian if he refused. As fast as</p>
<p>they arrive and settle down, they send for their sisters and</p>
<p>their cousins and their aunts. If you were thirsty, if a</p>
<p>warehouse were burning and beautiful Rhine wine were running to</p>
<p>waste, would you stay your hand from scooping a drink?Well, the</p>
<p>national warehouse is afire in many places, and no end of the</p>
<p>good things are running to waste. Help yourself. If you don&#x27;t,</p>
<p>the immigrants will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you don&#x27;t know him,&quot; Mrs. Hastings hurried to explain. &quot;He</p>
<p>spends all his time on the ranch in conserving the soil. There</p>
<p>are over a thousand acres of woods alone, and, though he thins</p>
<p>and forests like a surgeon, he won&#x27;t let a tree be chopped</p>
<p>without his permission. He&#x27;s even planted a hundred thousand</p>
<p>trees. He&#x27;s always draining and ditching to stop erosion, and</p>
<p>experimenting with pasture grasses. And every little while he</p>
<p>buys some exhausted adjoining ranch and starts building up the</p>
<p>soil.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wherefore I know what I &#x27;m talking about,&quot; Hastings broke in.</p>
<p>&quot;And my advice holds. I love the soil, yet tomorrow, things being</p>
<p>as they are and if I were poor, I&#x27;d gut five hundred acres in</p>
<p>order to buy twenty-five for myself. When you get into Sonoma</p>
<p>Valley, look me up, and I&#x27;ll put you onto the whole game, and</p>
<p>both ends of it. I&#x27;ll show you construction as well as</p>
<p>destruction. When you find a farm doomed to be gutted anyway, why</p>
<p>jump in and do it yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and he mortgaged himself to the eyes,&quot; laughed Mrs.</p>
<p>Hastings, &quot;to keep five hundred acres of woods out of the hands</p>
<p>of the charcoal burners.&quot;</p>
<p>Ahead, on the left bank of the Sacramento, just at the fading end</p>
<p>of the Montezuma Hills, Rio Vista appeared. The Roamer slipped</p>
<p>through the smooth water, past steamboat wharves, landing stages,</p>
<p>and warehouses. The two Japanese went for&#x27;ard on deck. At command</p>
<p>of Hastings, the jib ran down, and he shot the Roomer into the</p>
<p>wind, losing way, until he called, &quot;Let go the hook!&quot; The anchor</p>
<p>went down, and the yacht swung to it, so close to shore that the</p>
<p>skiff lay under overhanging willows.</p>
<p>&quot;Farther up the river we tie to the bank,&quot; Mrs. Hastings said,</p>
<p>&quot;so that when you wake in the morning you find the branches of</p>
<p>trees sticking down into the cabin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ooh!&quot; Saxon murmured, pointing to a lump on her wrist. &quot;Look at</p>
<p>that. A mosquito.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty early for them,&quot; Hastings said. &quot;But later on they&#x27;re</p>
<p>terrible. I&#x27;ve seen them so thick I couldn&#x27;t back the jib against</p>
<p>them.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was not nautical enough to appreciate his hyperbole, though</p>
<p>Billy grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no mosquitoes in the valley of the moon,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;No, never,&quot; said Mrs. Hastings, whose husband began immediately</p>
<p>to regret the smallness of the cabin which prevented him from</p>
<p>offering sleeping accommodations.</p>
<p>An automobile bumped along on top of the levee, and the young</p>
<p>boys and girls in it cried, &quot;Oh, you kid!&quot; to Saxon and Billy,</p>
<p>and Hastings, who was rowing them ashore in the skiff. Hastings</p>
<p>called, &quot;Oh, you kid!&quot; back to them; and Saxon, pleasuring in the</p>
<p>boyishness of his sunburned face, was reminded of the boyishness</p>
<p>of Mark Hall and his Carmel crowd.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
<p>Crossing the Sacramento on an old-fashioned ferry a short</p>
<p>distance above Rio Vista, Saxon and Billy entered the river</p>
<p>country. From the top of the levee she got her revelation.</p>
<p>Beneath, lower than the river, stretched broad, flat land, far as</p>
<p>the eye could see. Roads ran in every direction, and she saw</p>
<p>countless farmhouses of which she had never dreamed when sailing</p>
<p>on the lonely river a few feet the other side of the willowy</p>
<p>fringe.</p>
<p>Three weeks they spent among the rich farm islands, which heaped</p>
<p>up levees and pumped day and night to keep afloat. It was a</p>
<p>monotonous land, with an unvarying richness of soil and with only</p>
<p>one landmark--Mt. Diablo, ever to be seen, sleeping in the midday</p>
<p>azure, limping its crinkled mass against the sunset sky, or</p>
<p>forming like a dream out of the silver dawn. Sometimes on foot,</p>
<p>often by launch, they cries-crossed and threaded the river region</p>
<p>as far as the peat lands of the Middle River, down the San</p>
<p>Joaquin to Antioch, and up Georgiana Slough to Walnut Grove on</p>
<p>the Sacramento. And it proved a foreign land. The workers of the</p>
<p>soil teemed by thousands, yet Saxon and Billy knew what it was to</p>
<p>go a whole day without finding any one who spoke English. They</p>
<p>encountered --sometimes in whole villages--Chinese, Japanese,</p>
<p>Italians, Portuguese, Swiss, Hindus, Koreans, Norwegians, Danes,</p>
<p>French, Armenians, Slavs, almost every nationality save American.</p>
<p>One American they found on the lower reaches of Georgiana who</p>
<p>eked an illicit existence by fishing with traps. Another</p>
<p>American, who spouted blood and destruction on all political</p>
<p>subjects, was an itinerant bee-farmer. At Walnut Grove, bustling</p>
<p>with life, the few Americane consisted of the storekeeper, the</p>
<p>saloonkeeper, the butcher, the keeper of the drawbridge, and the</p>
<p>ferryman. Yet two thriving towns were in Walnut Grove, one</p>
<p>Chinese, one Japanese. Most of the land was owned by Americans,</p>
<p>who lived away from it and were continually selling it to the</p>
<p>foreigners.</p>
<p>A riot, or a merry-making--they could not tell which --was taking</p>
<p>place in the Japanese town, as Saxon and Billy steamed out on the</p>
<p>Apache, bound for Sacramento.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re settin&#x27; on the stoop,&quot; Billy railed. &quot;Pretty soon they&#x27;ll</p>
<p>crowd us off of that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There won&#x27;t be any stoop in the valley of the moon,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>cheered him.</p>
<p>But he was inconsolable, remarking bitterly:</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; they ain&#x27;t one of them damn foreigners that can handle four</p>
<p>horses like me.</p>
<p>&quot;But they can everlastingly farm,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>And Saxon, looking at his moody face, was suddenly reminded of a</p>
<p>lithograph she had seen in her childhood It was of a Plains</p>
<p>Indian, in paint and feathers, astride his horse and gazing with</p>
<p>wondering eye at a railroad train rushing along a fresh-made</p>
<p>track. The Indian had passed, she remembered, before the tide of</p>
<p>new life that brought the railroad. And were Billy and his kind</p>
<p>doomed to pass, she pondered, before this new tide of life,</p>
<p>amazingly industrious, that was flooding in from Asia and Europe?</p>
<p>At Sacramento they stopped two weeks, where Billy drove team and</p>
<p>earned the money to put them along on their travels. Also, life</p>
<p>in Oakland and Carmel, close to the salt edge of the coast, had</p>
<p>spoiled them for the interior. Too warm, was their verdict of</p>
<p>Sacramento and they followed the railroad west, through a region</p>
<p>of swamp-land, to Davisville. Here they were lured aside and to</p>
<p>the north to pretty Woodland, where Billy drove team for a fruit</p>
<p>farm, and where Saxon wrung from him a reluctant consent for her</p>
<p>to work a few days in the fruit harvest. She made an important</p>
<p>and mystifying secret of what she intended doing with her</p>
<p>earnings, and Billy teased her about it until the matter passed</p>
<p>from his mind. Nor did she tell him of a money order inclosed</p>
<p>with a certain blue slip of paper in a letter to Bud Strothers.</p>
<p>They began to suffer from the heat. Billy declared they had</p>
<p>strayed out of the blanket climate.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no redwoods here,&quot; Saxon said. &quot;We must go west toward</p>
<p>the coast. It is there we&#x27;ll find the valley of the moon.&quot;</p>
<p>From Woodland they swung west and south along the county roads to</p>
<p>the fruit paradise of Vacaville. Here Billy picked fruit, then</p>
<p>drove team; and here Saxon received a letter and a tiny express</p>
<p>package from Bud Strothers. When Billy came into camp from the</p>
<p>day&#x27;s work, she bade him stand still and shut his eyes. For a few</p>
<p>seconds she fumbled and did something to the breast of his cotton</p>
<p>work-shirt. Once, he felt a slight prick, as of a pin point, and</p>
<p>grunted, while she laughed and bullied him to continue keeping</p>
<p>his eyes shut.</p>
<p>&quot;Close your eyes and give me a kiss,&quot; she sang, &quot;and then I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>show you what iss.&quot;</p>
<p>She kissed him and when he looked down he saw, pinned to his</p>
<p>shirt, the gold medals he had pawned the day they had gone to the</p>
<p>moving picture show and received their inspiration to return to</p>
<p>the land.</p>
<p>&quot;You darned kid!&quot; he exclaimed, as he caught her to him. &quot;So</p>
<p>that&#x27;s what you blew your fruit money in on? An&#x27; I never</p>
<p>guessed!--Come here to you.&quot;</p>
<p>And thereupon she suffered the pleasant mastery of his brawn, and</p>
<p>was hugged and wrestled with until the coffee pot boiled over and</p>
<p>she darted from him to the rescue.</p>
<p>&quot;I kinda always been a mite proud of &#x27;em,&quot; he confessed, as he</p>
<p>rolled his after-supper cigarette. &quot;They take me back to my kid</p>
<p>days when I amateured it to beat the band. I was some kid in them</p>
<p>days, believe muh.--But say, d&#x27;ye know, they&#x27;d clean slipped my</p>
<p>recollection. Oakland&#x27;s a thousan&#x27; years away from you an&#x27; me,</p>
<p>an&#x27; ten thousan&#x27; miles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then this will bring you back to it,&quot; Saxon said, opening Bud&#x27;s</p>
<p>letter and reading it aloud.</p>
<p>Bud had taken it for granted that Billy knew the wind-up of the</p>
<p>strike; so he devoted himself to the details as to which men had</p>
<p>got back their jobs, and which had been blacklisted. To his own</p>
<p>amazement he had been taken back, and was now driving Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>horses. Still more amazing was the further information he had to</p>
<p>impart. The old foreman of the West Oakland stables had died, and</p>
<p>since then two other foremen had done nothing but make messes of</p>
<p>everything. The point of all which was that the Boss had spoken</p>
<p>that day to Bud, regretting the disappearance of Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t make no mistake,&quot; Bud wrote. &quot;The Boss is onto all your</p>
<p>curves. I bet he knows every scab you slugged. Just the same he</p>
<p>says to me--Strothers, if you ain&#x27;t at liberty to give me his</p>
<p>address, just write yourself and tell him for me to come a</p>
<p>running. I&#x27;ll give him a hundred and twenty-five a month to take</p>
<p>hold the stables.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon waited with well-concealed anxiety when the letter was</p>
<p>finished. Billy, stretched out, leaning on one elbow, blew a</p>
<p>meditative ring of smoke. His cheap workshirt, incongruously</p>
<p>brilliant with the gold of the medals that flashed in the</p>
<p>firelight, was open in front, showing the smooth skin and</p>
<p>splendid swell of chest. He glanced around--at the blankets</p>
<p>bowered in a green screen and waiting, at the campfire and the</p>
<p>blackened, battered coffee pot, at the well-worn hatchet, half</p>
<p>buried in a tree trunk, and lastly at Saxon. His eyes embraced</p>
<p>her; then into them came a slow expression of inquiry. But she</p>
<p>offered no help.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he uttered finally, &quot;all you gotta do is write Bud</p>
<p>Strothers, an&#x27; tell &#x27;m not on the Boss&#x27;s ugly tintype. --An&#x27;</p>
<p>while you&#x27;re about it, I&#x27;ll send &#x27;m the money to get my watch</p>
<p>out. You work out the interest. The overcoat can stay there an&#x27;</p>
<p>rot.&quot;</p>
<p>But they did not prosper in the interior heat. They lost weight.</p>
<p>The resilience went out of their minds and bodies. As Billy</p>
<p>expressed it, their silk was frazzled. So they shouldered their</p>
<p>packs and headed west across the wild mountains. In the Berryessa</p>
<p>Valley, the shimmering heat waves made their eyes ache, and their</p>
<p>heads; so that they traveled on in the early morning and late</p>
<p>afternoon. Still west they headed, over more mountains, to</p>
<p>beautiful Napa Valley. The next valley beyond was Sonoma, where</p>
<p>Hastings had invited them to his ranch. And here they would have</p>
<p>gone, had not Billy chanced upon a newspaper item which told of</p>
<p>the writer&#x27;s departure to cover some revolution that was breaking</p>
<p>out somewhere in Mexico.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll see &#x27;m later on,&quot; Billy said, as they turned northwest,</p>
<p>through the vineyards and orchards of Napa Valley. &quot;We&#x27;re like</p>
<p>that millionaire Bert used to sing about, except it&#x27;s time that</p>
<p>we&#x27;ve got to burn. Any direction is as good as any other, only</p>
<p>west is best.&quot;</p>
<p>Three times in the Napa Valley Billy refused work. Past St.</p>
<p>Helena, Saxon hailed with joy the unmistakable redwoods they</p>
<p>could see growing up the small canyons that penetrated the</p>
<p>western wall of the valley. At Calistoga, at the end of the</p>
<p>railroad, they saw the six-horse stages leaving for Middletown</p>
<p>and Lower Lake. They debated their route. That way led to Lake</p>
<p>County and not toward the coast, so Saxon and Billy swung west</p>
<p>through the mountains to the valley of the Russian River, coming</p>
<p>out at Healdsburg. They lingered in the hop-fields on the rich</p>
<p>bottoms, where Billy scorned to pick hops alongside of Indians,</p>
<p>Japanese, and Chinese.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn&#x27;t work alongside of &#x27;em an hour before I&#x27;d be knockin&#x27;</p>
<p>their blocks off,&quot; he explained. &quot;Besides, this Russian River&#x27;s</p>
<p>some nifty. Let&#x27;s pitch camp and go swimmin&#x27;. &quot;</p>
<p>So they idled their way north up the broad, fertile valley, so</p>
<p>happy that they forgot that work was ever necessary, while the</p>
<p>valley of the moon was a golden dream, remote, but sure, some day</p>
<p>of realization. At Cloverdale, Billy fell into luck. A</p>
<p>combination of sickness and mischance found the stage stables</p>
<p>short a driver. Each day the train disgorged passengers for the</p>
<p>Geysers, and Billy, as if accustomed to it all his life, took the</p>
<p>reins of six horses and drove a full load over the mountains in</p>
<p>stage time. The second trip he had Saxon beside him on the high</p>
<p>boxseat. By the end of two weeks the regular driver was back.</p>
<p>Billy declined a stable-job, took his wages, and continued north.</p>
<p>Saxon had adopted a fox terrier puppy and named him Possum, after</p>
<p>the dog Mrs. Hastings had told them about. So young was he that</p>
<p>he quickly became footsore, and she carried him until Billy</p>
<p>perched him on top of his pack and grumbled that Possum was</p>
<p>chewing his back hair to a frazzle.</p>
<p>They passed through the painted vineyards of Asti at the end of</p>
<p>the grape-picking, and entered Ukiah drenched to the skin by the</p>
<p>first winter rain.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; Billy said, &quot;you remember the way the Roamer just skated</p>
<p>along. Well, this summer&#x27;s done the same thing--gone by on</p>
<p>wheels. An&#x27; now it&#x27;s up to us to find some place to winter. This</p>
<p>Ukiah looks like a pretty good burg. We&#x27;ll get a room to-night</p>
<p>an&#x27; dry out. An&#x27; to-morrow I&#x27;ll hustle around to the stables, an&#x27;</p>
<p>if I locate anything we can rent a shack an&#x27; have all winter to</p>
<p>think about where we&#x27;ll go next year.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
<p>The winter proved much less exciting than the one spent in</p>
<p>Carmel, and keenly as Saxon had appreciated the Carmel folk, she</p>
<p>now appreciated them more keenly than ever. In Ukiah she formed</p>
<p>nothing more than superficial acquaintances. Here people were</p>
<p>more like those of the working class she had known in Oakland, or</p>
<p>else they were merely wealthy and herded together in automobiles.</p>
<p>There was no democratic artist-colony that pursued fellowship</p>
<p>disregardful of the caste of wealth.</p>
<p>Yet it was a more enjoyable winter than any she had spent in</p>
<p>Oakland. Billy had failed to get regular employment; so she saw</p>
<p>much of him, and they lived a prosperous and happy hand-to-mouth</p>
<p>existence in the tiny cottage they rented. As extra man at the</p>
<p>biggest livery stable, Billy&#x27;s spare time was so great that he</p>
<p>drifted into horse-trading. It was hazardous, and more than once</p>
<p>he was broke, but the table never wanted for the best of steak</p>
<p>and coffee, nor did they stint themselves for clothes.</p>
<p>&quot;Them blamed farmers--I gotta pass it to &#x27;em,&quot; Billy grinned one</p>
<p>day, when he had been particularly bested in a horse deal. &quot;They</p>
<p>won&#x27;t tear under the wings, the sons of guns. In the summer they</p>
<p>take in boarders, an&#x27; in the winter they make a good livin&#x27; coin&#x27;</p>
<p>each other up at tradin&#x27; horses. An&#x27; I just want to tell YOU,</p>
<p>Saxon, they&#x27;ve sure shown me a few. An&#x27; I &#x27;m gettin&#x27; tough under</p>
<p>the wings myself. I&#x27;ll never tear again so as you can notice it.</p>
<p>Which means one more trade learned for yours truly. I can make a</p>
<p>livin&#x27; anywhere now tradin&#x27; horses.&quot;</p>
<p>Often Billy had Saxon out on spare saddle horses from the stable,</p>
<p>and his horse deals took them on many trips into the surrounding</p>
<p>country. Likewise she was with him when he was driving horses to</p>
<p>sell on commission; and in both their minds, independently, arose</p>
<p>a new idea concerning their pilgrimage. Billy was the first to</p>
<p>broach it.</p>
<p>&quot;I run into an outfit the other day, that&#x27;s stored in town,&quot; he</p>
<p>said, &quot;an&#x27; it&#x27;s kept me thinkin&#x27; ever since. Ain&#x27;t no use tryin&#x27;</p>
<p>to get you to guess it, because you can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll tell you--the</p>
<p>swellest wagon-campin&#x27; outfit; anybody ever heard of. First of</p>
<p>all, the wagon&#x27;s a peacherino. Strong as they make &#x27;em. It was</p>
<p>made to order, upon Puget Sound, an&#x27; it was tested out all the</p>
<p>way down here. No load an&#x27; no road can strain it. The guy had</p>
<p>consumption that had it built. A doctor an&#x27; a cook traveled with</p>
<p>&#x27;m till he passed in his checks here in Ukiah two years ago. But</p>
<p>say--if you could see it. Every kind of a contrivance--a place</p>
<p>for everything--a regular home on wheels. Now, if we could get</p>
<p>that, an&#x27; a couple of plugs, we could travel like kings, an&#x27;</p>
<p>laugh at the weather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Billy! it&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve been dreamin&#x27; all winter. It</p>
<p>would be ideal. And . . . well, sometimes on the road I &#x27;m sure</p>
<p>you can&#x27;t help forgetting what a nice little wife you&#x27;ve got . .</p>
<p>. and with a wagon I could have all kinds of pretty clothes</p>
<p>along.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s blue eyes glowed a caress, cloudy and warm; as he said</p>
<p>quietly:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve ben thinkin&#x27; about that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you can carry a rifle and shotgun and fishing poles and</p>
<p>everything,&quot; she rushed along. &quot;And a good big axe, man-size,</p>
<p>instead of that hatchet you&#x27;re always complaining about. And</p>
<p>Possum can lift up his legs and rest. And--but suppose you can&#x27;t</p>
<p>buy it? How much do they want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One hundred an&#x27; fifty big bucks,&quot; he answered. &quot;But dirt cheap</p>
<p>at that. It&#x27;s givin&#x27; it away. I tell you that rig wasn&#x27;t built</p>
<p>for a cent less than four hundred, an&#x27; I know wagon-work in the</p>
<p>dark. Now, if I can put through that dicker with Caswell&#x27;s six</p>
<p>horses--say, I just got onto that horse-buyer to-day. If he buys</p>
<p>&#x27;em, who d&#x27;ye think he&#x27;ll ship &#x27;em to? To the Boss, right to the</p>
<p>West Oakland stables. I &#x27;m goin&#x27; to get you to write to him.</p>
<p>Travelin&#x27;, as we&#x27;re goin&#x27; to, I can pick up bargains. An&#x27; if the</p>
<p>Boss&#x27;ll talk, I can make the regular horse-buyer&#x27;s commissions.</p>
<p>He&#x27;ll have to trust me with a lot of money, though, which most</p>
<p>likely he won&#x27;t, knowin&#x27; all his scabs I beat up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he could trust you to run his stable, I guess he isn&#x27;t afraid</p>
<p>to let you handle his money,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>Billy shrugged his shoulders in modest dubiousness.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, anyway, as I was sayin&#x27; if I can sell Caswell&#x27;s six</p>
<p>horses, why, we can stand off this month&#x27;s bills an&#x27; buy the</p>
<p>wagon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But horses!&quot; Saxon queried anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;ll come later--if I have to take a regular job for two or</p>
<p>three months. The only trouble with that &#x27;d be that it&#x27;d run us</p>
<p>pretty well along into summer before we could pull out. But come</p>
<p>on down town an&#x27; I&#x27;ll show you the outfit right now. &quot;</p>
<p>Saxon saw the wagon and was so infatuated with it that she lost a</p>
<p>night&#x27;s sleep from sheer insomnia of anticipation. Then Caswell&#x27;s</p>
<p>six horses were sold, the month&#x27;s bills held over, and the wagon</p>
<p>became theirs. One rainy morning, two weeks later, Billy had</p>
<p>scarcely left the house, to be gone on an all-day trip into the</p>
<p>country after horses, when he was back again.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on!&quot; he called to Saxon from the street. &quot;Get your things</p>
<p>on an&#x27; come along. I want to show you something.&quot;</p>
<p>He drove down town to a board stable, and took her through to a</p>
<p>large, roofed inclosure in the rear. There he led to her a span</p>
<p>of sturdy dappled chestnuts, with cream-colored manes and tails.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, the beauties! the beauties!&quot; Saxon cried, resting her cheek</p>
<p>against the velvet muzzle of one, while the other roguishly</p>
<p>nuzzled for a share.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t they, though?&quot; Billy reveled, leading them up and down</p>
<p>before her admiring gaze. &quot;Thirteen hundred an&#x27; fifty each, an&#x27;</p>
<p>they don&#x27;t look the weight, they&#x27;re that slick put together. I</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t believe it myself, till I put &#x27;em on the scales.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven hundred an&#x27; seven pounds, the two of &#x27;em. An&#x27; I</p>
<p>tried &#x27;em out--that was two days ago. Good dispositions, no</p>
<p>faults, an&#x27; true-pullers, automobile broke an&#x27; all the rest. I&#x27;d</p>
<p>back &#x27;em to out-pull any team of their weight I ever seen.--Say,</p>
<p>how&#x27;d they look hooked up to that wagon of ourn?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon visioned the picture, and shook her head slowly in a</p>
<p>reaction of regret.</p>
<p>&quot;Three hundred spot cash buys &#x27;em,&quot; Billy went on. &quot;An&#x27; that&#x27;s</p>
<p>bed-rock. The owner wants the money so bad he&#x27;s droolin&#x27; for it.</p>
<p>Just gotta sell, an&#x27; sell quick. An&#x27; Saxon, honest to God, that</p>
<p>pair&#x27;d fetch five hundred at auction down in the city. Both</p>
<p>mares, full sisters, five an&#x27; six years old, registered Belgian</p>
<p>sire, out of a heavy standard-bred mare that I know. Three</p>
<p>hundred takes &#x27;em, an&#x27; I got the refusal for three days.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s regret changed to indignation.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, why did you show them to me? We haven&#x27;t any three hundred,</p>
<p>and you know it. All I&#x27;ve got in the house is six dollars, and</p>
<p>you haven&#x27;t that much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you think that&#x27;s all I brought you down town for,&quot; he</p>
<p>replied enigmatically. &quot;Well, it ain&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>He paused, licked his lips, and shifted his weight uneasily from</p>
<p>one leg to the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you listen till I get all done before you say anything.</p>
<p>Ready?&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Won&#x27;t open your mouth?&quot;</p>
<p>This time she obediently shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it&#x27;s this way,&quot; he began haltingly. &quot;They&#x27;s a youngster</p>
<p>come up from Frisco, Young Sandow they call &#x27;m, an&#x27; the Pride of</p>
<p>Telegraph Hill. He&#x27;s the real goods of a heavyweight, an&#x27; he was</p>
<p>to fight Montana Red Saturday night, only Montana Red, just in a</p>
<p>little trainin&#x27; bout, snapped his forearm yesterday. The managers</p>
<p>has kept it quiet. Now here&#x27;s the proposition. Lots of tickets</p>
<p>sold, an&#x27; they&#x27;ll be a big crowd Saturday night. At the last</p>
<p>moment, so as not to disappoint &#x27;em, they&#x27;ll spring me to take</p>
<p>Montana&#x27;s place. I &#x27;m the dark horse. Nobody knows me--not even</p>
<p>Young Sandow. He&#x27;s come up since my time. I&#x27;ll be a rube fighter.</p>
<p>I can fight as Horse Roberts.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, wait a minute. The winner&#x27;ll pull down three hundred big</p>
<p>round iron dollars. Wait, I &#x27;m tellin&#x27; you! It&#x27;s a lead-pipe</p>
<p>cinch. It&#x27;s like robbin&#x27; a corpse. Sandow&#x27;s got all the heart in</p>
<p>the world--regular knock~down-an&#x27;-drag-out-an&#x27;-hang-on fighter.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve followed &#x27;m in the papers. But he ain&#x27;t clever. I &#x27;m slow,</p>
<p>all right, all right, but I &#x27;m clever, an&#x27; I got a hay-maker in</p>
<p>each arm. I got Sandow&#x27;s number an&#x27; I know it.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, you got the say-so in this. If you say yes, the nags is</p>
<p>ourn. If you say no, then it&#x27;s all bets off, an&#x27; everything all</p>
<p>right, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll take to harness-washin&#x27; at the stable so as to</p>
<p>buy a couple of plugs. Remember, they&#x27;ll only be plugs, though.</p>
<p>But don&#x27;t look at me while you&#x27;re makin&#x27; up your mind. Keep your</p>
<p>lamps on the horses.&quot;</p>
<p>It was with painful indecision that she looked at the beautiful</p>
<p>animals.</p>
<p>&quot;Their names is Hazel an&#x27; Hattie,&quot; Billy put in a sly wedge. &quot;If</p>
<p>we get &#x27;em we could call it the &#x27;Double H&#x27; outfit.&quot;</p>
<p>But Saxon forgot the team and could only see Billy&#x27;s frightfully</p>
<p>bruised body the night he fought the Chicago Terror. She was</p>
<p>about to speak, when Billy, who had been hanging on her lips,</p>
<p>broke in:</p>
<p>&quot;Just hitch &#x27;em up to our wagon in your mind an&#x27; look at the</p>
<p>outfit. You got to go some to beat it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you&#x27;re not in training, Billy,&quot; she said suddenly and</p>
<p>without having intended to say it.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!&quot; he snorted. &quot;I&#x27;ve been in half trainin&#x27; for the last year.</p>
<p>My legs is like iron. They&#x27;ll hold me up as long as I&#x27;ve got a</p>
<p>punch left in my arms, and I always have that. Besides, I won&#x27;t</p>
<p>let &#x27;m make a long fight. He&#x27;s a man-eater, an&#x27; man-eaters is my</p>
<p>meat. I eat &#x27;m alive. It&#x27;s the clever boys with the stamina an&#x27;</p>
<p>endurance that I can&#x27;t put away. But this young Sandow&#x27;s my meat.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll get &#x27;m maybe in the third or fourth round--you know, time &#x27;m</p>
<p>in a rush an&#x27; hand it to &#x27;m just as easy. It&#x27;s a lead-pipe cinch,</p>
<p>I tell you. Honest to God, Saxon, it&#x27;s a shame to take the</p>
<p>money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I hate to think of you all battered up,&quot; she temporized. &quot;If</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t love you so, it might be different. And then, too, you</p>
<p>might get hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy laughed in contemptuous pride of youth and brawn.</p>
<p>&quot;You won&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve been in a fight, except that we&#x27;ll own Hazel</p>
<p>an&#x27; Hattie there. An&#x27; besides, Saxon, I just gotta stick my fist</p>
<p>in somebody&#x27;s face once in a while. You know I can go for months</p>
<p>peaceable an&#x27; gentle as a lamb, an&#x27; then my knuckles actually</p>
<p>begin to itch to land on something. Now, it&#x27;s a whole lot</p>
<p>sensibler to land on Young Sandow an&#x27; get three hundred for it,</p>
<p>than to land on some hayseed an&#x27; get hauled up an&#x27; fined before</p>
<p>some justice of the peace. Now take another squint at Hazel an&#x27;</p>
<p>Hattie. They&#x27;re regular farm furniture, good to breed from when</p>
<p>we get to that valley of the moon. An&#x27; they&#x27;re heavy enough to</p>
<p>turn right into the plowin&#x27;, .too.&quot;</p>
<p>The evening of the fight at quarter past eight, Saxon parted from</p>
<p>Billy. At quarter past nine, with hot water, ice, and everything</p>
<p>ready in anticipation, she heard the gate click and Billy&#x27;s step</p>
<p>come up the porch. She had agreed to the fight much against her</p>
<p>better judgment, and had regretted her consent every minute of</p>
<p>the hour she had just waited; so that, as she opened the front</p>
<p>door, she was expectant of any sort of a terrible husband-wreck.</p>
<p>But the Billy she saw was precisely the Billy she had parted</p>
<p>from.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no fights&quot; she cried, in so evident disappointment</p>
<p>that he laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;They was all yellin&#x27; &#x27;Fake! Fake!&#x27; when I left, an&#x27; wantin&#x27;</p>
<p>their money back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;ve got YOU,&quot; she laughed, leading him in, though</p>
<p>secretly she sighed farewell to Hazel and Hattie.</p>
<p>&quot;I stopped by the way to get something for you that you&#x27;ve been</p>
<p>wantin&#x27; some time,&quot; Billy said casually. &quot;Shut your eyes an&#x27; open</p>
<p>your hand; an&#x27; when you open your eyes you&#x27;ll find it grand,&quot; he</p>
<p>chanted.</p>
<p>Into her hand something was laid that was very heavy and very</p>
<p>cold, and when her eyes opened she saw it was a stack of fifteen</p>
<p>twenty-dollar gold pieces.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you it was like takin&#x27; money from a corpse,&quot; he exulted,</p>
<p>as he emerged grinning from the whirlwind of punches, whacks, and</p>
<p>hugs in which she had enveloped him. &quot;They wasn&#x27;t no fight at</p>
<p>all. D &#x27;ye want to know how long it lasted? Just twenty-seven</p>
<p>seconds--less &#x27;n half a minute. An&#x27; how many blows struck? One.</p>
<p>An&#x27; it was me that done it. Here, I&#x27;ll show you. It was just like</p>
<p>this--a regular scream.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy had taken his place in the middle of the room, slightly</p>
<p>crouching, chin tucked against the sheltering left shoulder,</p>
<p>fists closed, elbows in so as to guard left side and abdomen, and</p>
<p>forearms close to the body.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the first round,&quot; he pictured. &quot;Gong&#x27;s sounded, an&#x27; we&#x27;ve</p>
<p>shook hands. Of course, seein&#x27; as it&#x27;s a long fight an&#x27; we&#x27;ve</p>
<p>never seen each other in action, we ain&#x27;t in no rush. We&#x27;re just</p>
<p>feelin&#x27; each other out an&#x27; fiddlin&#x27; around. Seventeen seconds</p>
<p>like that. Not a blow struck. Nothin&#x27;. An&#x27; then it&#x27;s all off with</p>
<p>the big Swede. It takes some time to tell it, but it happened in</p>
<p>a jiffy, in fess In a tenth of a second. I wasn&#x27;t expectin&#x27; it</p>
<p>myself. We&#x27;re awful close together. His left glove ain&#x27;t a foot</p>
<p>from my jaw, an&#x27; my left glove ain&#x27;t a foot from hisn. He feints</p>
<p>with his right, an&#x27; I know it&#x27;s a feint, an&#x27; just hunch up my</p>
<p>left shoulder a bit an&#x27; feint with my right. That draws his guard</p>
<p>over just about an inch, an&#x27; I see my openin&#x27;. My left ain&#x27;t got</p>
<p>a foot to travel. I don&#x27;t draw it back none. I start it from</p>
<p>where it is, corkscrewin&#x27; around his right guard an&#x27; pivotin&#x27; at</p>
<p>the waist to put the weight of my shoulder into the punch. An&#x27; it</p>
<p>connects!-- Square on the point of the chin, sideways. He drops</p>
<p>deado. I walk back to my corner, an&#x27;, honest to God, Saxon, I</p>
<p>can&#x27;t help gigglin&#x27; a little, it was that easy. The referee</p>
<p>stands over &#x27;m an&#x27; counts &#x27;m out. He never quivers. The audience</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know what to make of it an&#x27; sits paralyzed. His seconds</p>
<p>carry &#x27;m to his corner an&#x27; set &#x27;m on the stool. But they gotta</p>
<p>hold &#x27;m up. Five minutes afterward he opens his eyes--but he</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t seein&#x27; nothing. They&#x27;re glassy. Five minutes more, an&#x27; he</p>
<p>stands up. They got to help hold &#x27;m, his legs givin&#x27; under &#x27;m</p>
<p>like they was sausages. An&#x27; the seconds has to help &#x27;m through</p>
<p>the ropes, an&#x27; they go down the aisle to his dressin&#x27; room</p>
<p>a-helpin&#x27; &#x27;m. An&#x27; the crowd beginning to yell fake an&#x27; want its</p>
<p>money back. Twenty-seven seconds--one punch --n&#x27; a spankin&#x27; pair</p>
<p>of horses for the best wife Billy Roberts ever had in his long</p>
<p>experience.&quot;</p>
<p>All of Saxon&#x27;s old physical worship of her husband revived and</p>
<p>doubled on itself many times. He was in all truth a hero, worthy</p>
<p>to be of that wing-helmeted company leaping from the beaked boats</p>
<p>upon the bloody English sands. The next morning he was awakened</p>
<p>by her lips pressed on his left hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey!--what are you doin&#x27;?&#x27;&quot; he demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Kissing Hazel and Hattie good morning,&quot; she answered demurely.</p>
<p>&quot;And now I &#x27;m going to kiss you good morning.... And just where</p>
<p>did your punch land? Show me.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy complied, touching the point of her chin with his knuckles.</p>
<p>With both her hands on his arm, she shored it back and tried to</p>
<p>draw it forward sharply in similitude of a punch. But Billy</p>
<p>withstrained her.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; he said. &quot;You don&#x27;t want to knock your jaw off. I&#x27;ll show</p>
<p>you. A quarter of an inch will do.&quot;</p>
<p>And at a distance of a quarter of an inch from her chin he</p>
<p>administered the slightest flick of a tap.</p>
<p>On the instant Saxon&#x27;s brain snapped with a white flash of light,</p>
<p>while her whole body relaxed, numb and weak, volitionless, sad</p>
<p>her vision reeled and blurred. The next instant she was herself</p>
<p>again, in her eyes terror and understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;And it was at a foot that you struck him,&quot; she murmured in a</p>
<p>voice of awe.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and with the weight of my shoulders behind it,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>laughed. &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s nothing.--Here, let me show you something</p>
<p>else.&quot;</p>
<p>He searched out her solar plexus, and did no more than snap his</p>
<p>middle finger against it. This time she experienced a simple</p>
<p>paralysis, accompanied by a stoppage of breath, but with a brain</p>
<p>and vision that remained perfectly clear. In a moment, however,</p>
<p>all the unwonted sensations were gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Solar Plexus,&quot; Billy elucidated. &quot;Imagine what it&#x27;s like when</p>
<p>the other fellow lifts a wallop to it all the way from his knees.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the punch that won the championship of the world for Bob</p>
<p>Fitzsimmons.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon shuddered, then resigned herself to Billy&#x27;s playful</p>
<p>demonstration of the weak points in the human anatomy. He pressed</p>
<p>the tip of a finger into the middle of her forearm, and she knew</p>
<p>excruciating agony. On either side of her neck, at the base, he</p>
<p>dented gently with his thumbs, and she felt herself quickly</p>
<p>growing unconscious.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s one of the death touches of the Japs,&quot; he told her, and</p>
<p>went on, accompanying grips and holds with a running exposition.</p>
<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s the toe-hold that Notch defeated Hackenschmidt with. I</p>
<p>learned it from Farmer Burns.--An&#x27; here&#x27;s a half-Nelson.--An&#x27;</p>
<p>here&#x27;s you makin&#x27; roughhouse at a dance, an&#x27; I &#x27;m the floor</p>
<p>manager, an&#x27; I gotta put you out.&quot;</p>
<p>One hand grasped her wrist, the other hand passed around and</p>
<p>under her forearm and grasped his own wrist. And at the first</p>
<p>hint of pressure she felt that her arm was a pipe-stem about to</p>
<p>break.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s called the &#x27;come along.&#x27;--An&#x27; here&#x27;s the strong arm. A</p>
<p>boy can down a man with it. An&#x27; if you ever get into a scrap an&#x27;</p>
<p>the other fellow gets your nose between his teeth--you don&#x27;t want</p>
<p>to lose your nose, do you? Well, this is what you do, quick as a</p>
<p>flash.&quot;</p>
<p>Involuntarily she closed her eyes as Billy&#x27;s thumb-ends pressed</p>
<p>into them. She could feel the fore-running ache of a dull and</p>
<p>terrible hurt.</p>
<p>&quot;If he don&#x27;t let go, you just press real hard, an&#x27; out pop his</p>
<p>eyes, an&#x27; he&#x27;s blind as a bat for the rest of his life. Oh, he&#x27;ll</p>
<p>let go all right all right.&quot;</p>
<p>He released her and lay back laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;How d&#x27;ye feel?&quot; he asked. &quot;Those ain&#x27;t boxin&#x27; tricks, but</p>
<p>they&#x27;re all in the game of a roughhouse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel like revenge,&quot; she said, trying to apply the &quot;come along&quot;</p>
<p>to his arm.</p>
<p>When she exerted the pressure she cried out with pain, for she</p>
<p>had succeeded only in hurting herself. Billy grinned at her</p>
<p>futility. She dug her thumbs into his neck in imitation of the</p>
<p>Japanese death touch, then gazed ruefully at the bent ends of her</p>
<p>nails. She punched him smartly on the point of the chin, and</p>
<p>again cried out, this time to the bruise of her knuckles.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this can&#x27;t hurt me,&quot; she gritted through her teeth, as she</p>
<p>assailed his solar plexus with her doubled fists.</p>
<p>By this time he was in a roar of laughter. Under the sheaths of</p>
<p>muscles that were as armor, the fatal nerve center remained</p>
<p>impervious.</p>
<p>&quot;Go on, do it some more,&quot; he urged, when she had given up,</p>
<p>breathing heavily. &quot;It feels fine, like you was ticklin&#x27; me with</p>
<p>a feather.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, Mister Man,&quot; she threatened balefully. &quot;You can talk</p>
<p>about your grips and death touches and all the rest, but that&#x27;s</p>
<p>all man&#x27;s game. I know something that will beat them all, that</p>
<p>will make a strong man as helpless as a baby. Wait a minute till</p>
<p>I get it. There. Shut your eyes. Ready? I won&#x27;t be a second.&quot;</p>
<p>He waited with closed eyes, and then, softly as rose petals</p>
<p>fluttering down, he felt her lips on his mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;You win,&quot; he said in solemn ecstasy, and passed his arms around</p>
<p>her.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
<p>In the morning Billy went down town to pay for Hazel and Hattie.</p>
<p>It was due to Saxon&#x27;s impatient desire to see them, that he</p>
<p>seemed to take a remarkably long time about so simple a</p>
<p>transaction. But she forgave him when he arrived with the two</p>
<p>horses hitched to the camping wagon.</p>
<p>&quot;Had to borrow the harness,&quot; he said. &quot;Pass Possum up and climb</p>
<p>in, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll show you the Double H Outfit, which is some outfit,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m tellin&#x27; you.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s delight was unbounded and almost speechless as they drove</p>
<p>out into the country behind the dappled chestnuts with the</p>
<p>cream-colored tails and manes. The seat was upholstered,</p>
<p>high-backed, and comfortable; and Billy raved about the wonders</p>
<p>of the efficient brake. He trotted the team along the hard county</p>
<p>road to show the standard-going in them, and put them up a steep</p>
<p>earthroad, almost hub-deep with mud, to prove that the light</p>
<p>Belgian sire was not wanting in their make-up.</p>
<p>When Saxon at last lapsed into complete silence, he studied her</p>
<p>anxiously, with quick sidelong glances. She sighed and asked:</p>
<p>&quot;When do you think we&#x27;ll be able to start?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe in two weeks . . . or, maybe in two or three months. &quot; He</p>
<p>sighed with solemn deliberation. &quot;We&#x27;re like the Irishman with</p>
<p>the trunk an&#x27; nothin&#x27; to put in it. Here&#x27;s the wagon, here&#x27;s the</p>
<p>horses, an&#x27; nothin&#x27; to pull. I know a peach of a shotgun I can</p>
<p>get, second-hand, eighteen dollars; but look at the bills we owe.</p>
<p>Then there&#x27;s a new &#x27;22 Automatic rifle I want for you. An&#x27; a</p>
<p>30-30 I&#x27;ve had my eye on for deer. An&#x27; you want a good jointed</p>
<p>pole as well as me. An&#x27; tackle costs like Sam Hill. An&#x27; harness</p>
<p>like I want will cost fifty bucks cold. An&#x27; the wagon ought to be</p>
<p>painted. Then there&#x27;s pasture ropes, an&#x27; nose-bags, an&#x27; a harness</p>
<p>punch, an&#x27; all such things. An&#x27; Hazel an&#x27; Hattie eatin&#x27; their</p>
<p>heads off all the time we&#x27;re waitin&#x27;. An&#x27; I &#x27;m just itchin&#x27; to be</p>
<p>started myself.&quot;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly and confusedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Billy, what have you got up your sleeve?--I can see it in</p>
<p>your eyes,&quot; Saxon demanded and indicted in mixed metaphors.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Saxon, you see, it&#x27;s like this. Sandow ain&#x27;t satisfied.</p>
<p>He&#x27;s madder &#x27;n a hatter. Never got one punch at me. Never had a</p>
<p>chance to make a showin&#x27;, an&#x27; he wants a return match. He&#x27;s</p>
<p>blattin&#x27; around town that he can lick me with one hand tied</p>
<p>behind &#x27;m, an&#x27; all that kind of hot air. Which ain&#x27;t the point.</p>
<p>The point is, the fight-fans is wild to see a return-match. They</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t get a run for their money last time. They&#x27;ll fill the</p>
<p>house. The managers has seen me already. That was why I was so</p>
<p>long. They&#x27;s three hundred more waitin&#x27; on the tree for me to</p>
<p>pick two weeks from last night if you&#x27;ll say the word. It&#x27;s just</p>
<p>the same as I told you before. He&#x27;s my meat. He still thinks I &#x27;m</p>
<p>a rube, an&#x27; that it was a fluke punch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, Billy, you told me long ago that fighting took the silk out</p>
<p>of you. That was why you&#x27;d quit it and stayed by teaming.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not this kind of fightin&#x27;,&quot; he answered. &quot;I got this one all</p>
<p>doped out. I&#x27;ll let &#x27;m last till about the seventh. Not that</p>
<p>it&#x27;ll be necessary, but just to give the audience a run for its</p>
<p>money. Of course, I&#x27;ll get a lump or two, an&#x27; lose some skin.</p>
<p>Then I&#x27;ll time &#x27;m to that glass jaw of his an&#x27; drop &#x27;m for the</p>
<p>count. An&#x27; we&#x27;ll be all packed up, an&#x27; next mornin&#x27; we&#x27;ll pull</p>
<p>out. What d&#x27;ye say? Aw, come on.&quot;</p>
<p>Saturday night, two weeks later, Saxon ran to the door when the</p>
<p>gate clicked. Billy looked tired. His hair was wet, his nose</p>
<p>swollen, one cheek was puffed, there was skin missing from his</p>
<p>ears, and both eyes were slightly bloodshot.</p>
<p>&quot;I &#x27;m darned if that boy didn&#x27;t fool me,&quot; he said, as he placed</p>
<p>the roll of gold pieces in her hand and sat down with her on his</p>
<p>knees. &quot;He&#x27;s some boy when he gets extended. Instead of stoppin&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;m at the seventh, he kept me hustlin&#x27; till the fourteenth. Then</p>
<p>I got &#x27;m the way I said. It&#x27;s too bad he&#x27;s got a glass jaw. He&#x27;s</p>
<p>quicker&#x27;n I thought, an&#x27; he&#x27;s got a wallop that made me mighty</p>
<p>respectful from the second round--an&#x27; the prettiest little chop</p>
<p>an&#x27; come-again I ever saw. But that glass jaw! He kept it in</p>
<p>cotton wool till the fourteenth an&#x27; then I connected.</p>
<p>&quot;--An&#x27;, say. I &#x27;m mighty glad it did last fourteen rounds. I</p>
<p>still got all my silk. I could see that easy. I wasn&#x27;t breathin&#x27;</p>
<p>much, an&#x27; every round was fast. An&#x27; my legs was like iron. I</p>
<p>could a-fought forty rounds. You see, I never said nothin&#x27;, but</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been suspicious all the time after that beatin&#x27; the Chicago</p>
<p>Terror gave me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense!--you would have known it long before now,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>cried. &quot;Look at all your boxing, and wrestling, and running at</p>
<p>Carmel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope.&quot; Billy shok his head with the conviction of utter</p>
<p>knowledge. &quot;That&#x27;s different. It don&#x27;t take it outa you. You</p>
<p>gotta be up against the real thing, fightin&#x27; for life, round</p>
<p>after round, with a husky you know ain&#x27;t lost a thread of his</p>
<p>silk yet--then, if you don&#x27;t blow up, if your legs is steady, an&#x27;</p>
<p>your heart ain&#x27;t burstin&#x27;, an&#x27; you ain&#x27;t wobbly at all, an&#x27; no</p>
<p>signs of queer street in your head--why, then you know you still</p>
<p>got all your silk. An&#x27; I got it, I got all mine, d&#x27;ye hear me,</p>
<p>an&#x27; I ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to risk it on no more fights. That&#x27;s straight.</p>
<p>Easy money&#x27;s hardest in the end. From now on it&#x27;s horsebuyin&#x27; on</p>
<p>commish, an&#x27; you an&#x27; me on the road till we find that valley of</p>
<p>the moon.&quot;</p>
<p>Next morning, early, they drove out of Ukiah. Possum sat on the</p>
<p>seat between them, his rosy mouth agape with excitement. They had</p>
<p>originally planned to cross over to the coast from Ukiah, but it</p>
<p>was too early in the season for the soft earth-roads to be in</p>
<p>shape after the winter rains; so they turned east, for Lake</p>
<p>County, their route to extend north through the upper Sacramento</p>
<p>Valley and across the mountains into Oregon. Then they would</p>
<p>circle west to the coast, where the roads by that time would be</p>
<p>in condition, and come down its length to the Golden Gate.</p>
<p>All the land was green and flower-sprinkled, and each tiny</p>
<p>valley, as they entered the hills, was a garden.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!&quot; Billy remarked scornfully to the general landscape. &quot;They</p>
<p>say a rollin&#x27; stone gathers no moss. Just the same this looks</p>
<p>like some outfit we&#x27;ve gathered. Never had so much actual</p>
<p>property in my life at one time--an&#x27; them was the days when I</p>
<p>wasn&#x27;t rollin&#x27;. Hell--even the furniture wasn&#x27;t ourn. Only the</p>
<p>clothes we stood up in, an&#x27; some old socks an&#x27; things.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon reached out and touched his hand, and he knew that it was a</p>
<p>hand that loved his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve only one regret,&quot; she said. &quot;You&#x27;ve earned it all yourself.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve had nothing to do with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!--you&#x27;ve had everything to do with it. You&#x27;re like my second</p>
<p>in a fight. You keep me happy an&#x27; in condition. A man can&#x27;t fight</p>
<p>without a good second to take care of him. Hell, I wouldn&#x27;t a-ben</p>
<p>here if it wasn&#x27;t for you. You made me pull up stakes an&#x27; head</p>
<p>out. Why, if it hadn&#x27;t been for you I&#x27;d a-drunk myself dead an&#x27;</p>
<p>rotten by this time, or had my neck stretched at San Quentin over</p>
<p>hittin&#x27; some scab too hard or something or other. An&#x27; look at me</p>
<p>now. Look at that roll of greenbacks&quot;-- he tapped his breast--&quot;to</p>
<p>buy the Boss some horses. Why, we&#x27;re takin&#x27; an unendin&#x27; vacation,</p>
<p>an&#x27; makin&#x27; a good livin&#x27; at the same time. An&#x27; one more trade I</p>
<p>got--horse-buyin&#x27; for Oakland. If I show I&#x27;ve got the savve, an&#x27;</p>
<p>I have, all the Frisco firms&#x27;ll be after me to buy for them. An&#x27;</p>
<p>it&#x27;s all your fault. You&#x27;re my Tonic Kid all right, all right,</p>
<p>an&#x27; if Possum wasn&#x27;t lookin&#x27;, I&#x27;d--well, who cares if he does</p>
<p>look?&quot;</p>
<p>And Billy leaned toward her sidewise and kissed her.</p>
<p>The way grew hard and rocky as they began to climb, but the</p>
<p>divide was an easy one, and they soon dropped down the canyon of</p>
<p>the Blue Lakes among lush fields of golden poppies. In the bottom</p>
<p>of the canyon lay a wandering sheet of water of intensest blue.</p>
<p>Ahead, the folds of hills interlaced the distance, with a remote</p>
<p>blue mountain rising in the center of the picture.</p>
<p>They asked questions of a handsome, black-eyed man with curly</p>
<p>gray hair, who talked to them in a German accent, while a</p>
<p>cheery-faced woman smiled down at them out of a trellised high</p>
<p>window of the Swiss cottage perched on the bank. Billy watered</p>
<p>the horses at a pretty hotel farther on, where the proprietor</p>
<p>came out and talked and told him he had built it himself,</p>
<p>according to the plans of the black-eyed man with the curly gray</p>
<p>hair, who was a San Francisco architect.</p>
<p>&quot;Goin&#x27; up, goin&#x27; up,&quot; Billy chortled, as they drove on through</p>
<p>the winding hills past another lake of intensest blue. &quot;D&#x27;ye</p>
<p>notice the difference in our treatment already between ridin&#x27; an&#x27;</p>
<p>walkin&#x27; with packs on our backs? With Hazel an&#x27; Hattie an&#x27; Saxon</p>
<p>an&#x27; Possum, an&#x27; yours truly, an&#x27; this high-toned wagon, folks</p>
<p>most likely take us for millionaires out on a lark.&quot;</p>
<p>The way widened. Broad, oak-studded pastures with grazing</p>
<p>livestock lay on either hand. Then Clear Lake opened before them</p>
<p>like an inland sea, flecked with little squalls and flaws of wind</p>
<p>from the high mountains on the northern slopes of which still</p>
<p>glistened white snow patches.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve heard Mrs. Hazard rave about Lake Geneva,&quot; Saxon recalled;</p>
<p>&quot;but I wonder if it is more beautiful than this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That architect fellow called this the California Alps, you</p>
<p>remember,&quot; Billy confirmed. &quot;An&#x27; if I don&#x27;t mistake, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>Lakeport showin&#x27; up ahead. An&#x27; all wild country, an&#x27; no</p>
<p>railroads.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And no moon valleys here,&quot; Saxon criticized. &quot;But it is</p>
<p>beautiful, oh, so beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hotter&#x27;n hell in the dead of summer, I&#x27;ll bet,&quot; was Billy&#x27;s</p>
<p>opinion. &quot;Nope, the country we&#x27;re lookin&#x27; for lies nearer the</p>
<p>coast. Just the same it is beautiful . . . like a picture on the</p>
<p>wall. What d&#x27;ye say we stop off an&#x27; go for a swim this</p>
<p>afternoon?&quot;</p>
<p>Ten days later they drove into Williams, in Colusa County, and</p>
<p>for the first time again encountered a railroad. Billy was</p>
<p>looking for it, for the reason that at the rear of the wagon</p>
<p>walked two magnificent work-horses which he had picked up for</p>
<p>shipment to Oakland.</p>
<p>&quot;Too hot,&quot; was Saxon&#x27;s verdict, as she gazed across the</p>
<p>shimmering level of the vast Sacramento Valley. &quot;No redwoods. No</p>
<p>hills. No forests. No manzanita. No madronos. Lonely, and sad--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; like the river islands,&quot; Billy interpolated. &quot;Richer in</p>
<p>hell, but looks too much like hard work. It&#x27;ll do for those</p>
<p>that&#x27;s stuck on hard work--God knows, they&#x27;s nothin&#x27; here to</p>
<p>induce a fellow to knock off ever for a bit of play. No fishin&#x27;,</p>
<p>no huntin&#x27;, nothin&#x27; but work. I&#x27;d work myself, if I had to live</p>
<p>here.&quot;</p>
<p>North they drove, through days of heat and dust, across the</p>
<p>California plains, and everywhere was manifest the &quot;new&quot;</p>
<p>farming--great irrigation ditches, dug and being dug, the land</p>
<p>threaded by power-lines from the mountains, and many new</p>
<p>farmhouses on small holdings newly fenced. The bonanza farms were</p>
<p>being broken up. However, many of the great estates remained,</p>
<p>five to ten thousand acres in extent, running from the Sacramento</p>
<p>bank to the horizon dancing in the heat waves, and studded with</p>
<p>great valley oaks.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes rich soil to make trees like those,&quot; a ten-acre farmer</p>
<p>told them.</p>
<p>They had driven off the road a hundred feet to his tiny barn in</p>
<p>order to water Hazel and Hattie. A sturdy young orchard covered</p>
<p>most of his ten acres, though a goodly portion was devoted to</p>
<p>whitewashed henhouses and wired runways wherein hundreds of</p>
<p>chickens were to be seen. He had just begun work on a small frame</p>
<p>dwelling.</p>
<p>&quot;I took a vacation when I bought,&quot; he explained, &quot;and planted the</p>
<p>trees. Then I went back to work an&#x27; stayed with it till the place</p>
<p>was cleared. Now I &#x27;m here for keeps, an&#x27; soon as the house is</p>
<p>finished I&#x27;ll send for the wife. She&#x27;s not very well, and it will</p>
<p>do her good. We&#x27;ve been planning and working for years to get</p>
<p>away from- the city.&quot; He stopped in order to give a happy sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;And now we&#x27;re free.&quot;</p>
<p>The water in the trough was warm from the sun.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; the man said. &quot;Don&#x27;t let them drink that. I&#x27;ll give it</p>
<p>to them cool.&quot;</p>
<p>Stepping into a small shed, he turned an electric switch, and a</p>
<p>motor the size of a fruit box hummed into action. A five-inch</p>
<p>stream of sparkling water splashed into the shallow main ditch of</p>
<p>his irrigation system and flowed away across the orchard through</p>
<p>many laterals.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#x27; tit beautiful, eh?--beautiful! beautiful!&quot; the man chanted</p>
<p>in an ecstasy. &quot;It&#x27;s bud and fruit. It&#x27;s blood and life. Look at</p>
<p>it! It makes a gold mine laughable, and a saloon a nightmare. I</p>
<p>know. I . . . I used to be a barkeeper. In fact, I&#x27;ve been a</p>
<p>barkeeper most of my life. That&#x27;s how I paid for this place. And</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve hated the business all the time. I was a farm boy, and all</p>
<p>my life I&#x27;ve been wanting to get back to it. And here I am at</p>
<p>last.&quot;</p>
<p>He wiped his glasses the better to behold his beloved water, then</p>
<p>seized a hoe and strode down the main ditch to open more</p>
<p>laterals.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s the funniest barkeeper I ever seen,&quot; Billy commented. &quot;I</p>
<p>took him for a business man of some sort. Must a-ben in some kind</p>
<p>of a quiet hotel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t drive on right away,&quot; Saxon requested. &quot;I want to talk</p>
<p>with him.&quot;</p>
<p>He came back, polishing his glasses, his face beaming, watching</p>
<p>the water as if fascinated by it. It required no more exertion on</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s part to start him than had been required on his part to</p>
<p>start the motor.</p>
<p>&quot;The pioneers settled all this in the early fifties,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Mexicans never got this far, so it was government land.</p>
<p>Everybody got a hundred and sixty acres. And such acres! The</p>
<p>stories they tell about how much wheat they got to the acre are</p>
<p>almost unbelievable. Then several things happened. The sharpest</p>
<p>and steadiest of the pioneers held what they had and added to it</p>
<p>from the other fellows. It takes a great many quarter sections to</p>
<p>make a bonanza farm. It wasn&#x27;t long before it was &#x27;most all</p>
<p>bonanza farms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were the successful gamblers,&quot; Saxon put in, remembering</p>
<p>Mark Hall&#x27;s words.</p>
<p>The man nodded appreciatively and continued.</p>
<p>&quot;The old folks schemed and gathered and added the land into the</p>
<p>big holdings, and built the great barns and mansions, and planted</p>
<p>the house orchards and flower gardens. The young folks were</p>
<p>spoiled by so much wealth and went away to the cities to spend</p>
<p>it. And old folks and young united in one thing: in impoverishing</p>
<p>the soil. Year after year they scratched it and took out bonanza</p>
<p>crops. They put nothing back. All they left was plow-sole and</p>
<p>exhausted land. Why, there&#x27;s big sections they exhausted and left</p>
<p>almost desert.</p>
<p>&quot;The bonanza farmers are all gone now, thank the Lord, and here&#x27;s</p>
<p>where we small farmers come into our own. It won&#x27;t be many years</p>
<p>before the whole valley will be farmed in patches like mine. Look</p>
<p>at what we&#x27;re doing! Worked-out land that had ceased to grow</p>
<p>wheat, and we turn the water on, treat the soil decently, and see</p>
<p>our orchards!</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve got the water--from the mountains, and from under the</p>
<p>ground. I was reading an account the other day. All life depends</p>
<p>on food. All food depends on water. It takes a thousand pounds of</p>
<p>water to produce one pound of food; ten thousand pounds to</p>
<p>produce one pound of meat. How much water do you drink in a year?</p>
<p>About a ton. But you eat about two hundred pounds of vegetables</p>
<p>and two hundred pounds of meat a year--which means you consume</p>
<p>one hundred tons of water in the vegetables and one thousand tons</p>
<p>in the meat--which means that it takes eleven hundred and one</p>
<p>tons of water each year to keep a small woman like you going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!&quot; was all Billy could say.</p>
<p>&quot;You see how population depends upon water,&quot; the ax-barkeeper</p>
<p>went on. &quot;Well, we&#x27;ve got the water, immense subterranean</p>
<p>supplies, and in not many years this valley will be populated as</p>
<p>thick as Belgium.&quot;</p>
<p>Fascinated by the five-inch stream, sluiced out of the earth and</p>
<p>back to the earth by the droning motor, he forgot his discourse</p>
<p>and stood and gazed, rapt and unheeding, while his visitors drove</p>
<p>on.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; him a drink-slinger!&quot; Billy marveled. &quot;He can sure sling the</p>
<p>temperance dope if anybody should ask you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s lovely to think about--all that water, and all the happy</p>
<p>people that will come here to live--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it ain&#x27;t the valley of the moon!&quot; Billy laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she responded. &quot;They don&#x27;t have to irrigate in the valley</p>
<p>of the moon, unless for alfalfa and such crops. What we want is</p>
<p>the water bubbling naturally from the ground, and crossing the</p>
<p>farm in little brooks, and on the boundary a fine big creek--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With trout in it!&quot; Billy took her up. &quot;An&#x27; willows and trees of</p>
<p>all kinds growing along the edges, and here a riffle where you</p>
<p>can flip out trout, and there a deep pool where you can swim and</p>
<p>high-dive. An&#x27; kingfishers, an&#x27; rabbits comin&#x27; down to drink,</p>
<p>an&#x27;, maybe, a deer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And meadowlarks in the pasture,&quot; Saxon added. &quot;And mourning</p>
<p>doves in the trees. We must have mourning doves--and the big,</p>
<p>gray tree-squirrels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!--that valley of the moon&#x27;s goin&#x27; to be some valley,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>meditated, flicking a fly away with his whip from Hattie&#x27;s side.</p>
<p>&quot;Think we&#x27;ll ever find it?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon nodded her head with great certitude.</p>
<p>&quot;Just as the Jews found the promised land, and the Mormons Utah,</p>
<p>and the Pioneers California. You remember the last advice we got</p>
<p>when we left Oakland&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;Tis them that looks that finds.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV</p>
<p>Ever north, through a fat and flourishing rejuvenated land,</p>
<p>stopping at the towns of Willows, Red Bluff and Redding, crossing</p>
<p>the counties of Colusa, Glenn, Tehama, and Shasta, went the</p>
<p>spruce wagon drawn by the dappled chestnuts with cream-colored</p>
<p>manes and tails. Billy picked up only three horses for shipment,</p>
<p>although he visited many farms; and Saxon talked with the women</p>
<p>while he looked over the stock with the men. And Saxon grew the</p>
<p>more convinced that the valley she sought lay not there.</p>
<p>At Redding they crossed the Sacramento on a cable ferry, and made</p>
<p>a day&#x27;s scorching traverse through rol}ing foot-hills and flat</p>
<p>tablelands. The heat grew more insupportable, and the trees and</p>
<p>shrubs were blasted and dead. Then they came again to the</p>
<p>Sacramento, where the great smelters of Kennett explained the</p>
<p>destruction of the vegetation.</p>
<p>They climbed out of the smelting town, where eyrie houses perched</p>
<p>insecurely on a precipitous landscape. It was a broad,</p>
<p>well-engineered road that took them up a grade miles long and</p>
<p>plunged down into the Canyon of the Sacramento. The road,</p>
<p>rock-surfaced and easy-graded, hewn out of the canyon wall, grew</p>
<p>so narrow that Billy worried for fear of meeting opposite-bound</p>
<p>teams. Far below, the river frothed and flowed over pebbly</p>
<p>shallows, or broke tumultuously over boulders and cascades, in</p>
<p>its race for the great valley they had left behind.</p>
<p>Sometimes, on the wider stretches of road, Saxon drove and Billy</p>
<p>walked to lighten the load. She insisted on taking her turns at</p>
<p>walking, and when he breathed the panting mares on the steep, and</p>
<p>Saxon stood by their heads caressing them and cheering them,</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s joy was too deep for any turn of speech as he gazed at</p>
<p>his beautiful horses and his glowing girl, trim and colorful in</p>
<p>her golden brown corduroy, the brown corduroy calves swelling</p>
<p>sweetly under the abbreviated slim skirt. And when her answering</p>
<p>look of happiness came to him--a sudden dimness in her straight</p>
<p>gray eyes--he was overmastered by the knowledge that he must say</p>
<p>something or burst.</p>
<p>&quot;O. you kid!&quot; he cried.</p>
<p>And with radiant face she answered, &quot;O, you kid!&quot;</p>
<p>They camped one night in a deep dent in the canyon, where was</p>
<p>snuggled a box-factory village, and where a toothless ancient,</p>
<p>gazing with faded eyes at their traveling outfit, asked: &quot;Be you</p>
<p>showin&#x27;?&quot;</p>
<p>They passed Castle Crags, mighty-bastioned and glowing red</p>
<p>against the palpitating blue sky. They caught their first glimpse</p>
<p>of Mt. Shasta, a rose-tinted snow-peak rising, a sunset dream,</p>
<p>between and beyond green interlacing walls of canyon--a landmark</p>
<p>destined to be with them for many days. At unexpected turns,</p>
<p>after mounting some steep grade, Shasta would appear again, still</p>
<p>distant, now showing two peaks and glacial fields of shimmering</p>
<p>white. Miles and miles and days and days they climbed, with</p>
<p>Shasta ever developing new forms and phases in her summer snows.</p>
<p>&quot;A moving picture in the sky,&quot; said Billy at last.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,--it is all so beautiful,&quot; sighed Saxon. &quot;But there are no</p>
<p>moon-valleys here.&quot;</p>
<p>They encountered a plague of butterflies, and for days drove</p>
<p>through untold millions of the fluttering beauties that covered</p>
<p>the road with uniform velvet-brown. And ever the road seemed to</p>
<p>rise under the noses of the snorting mares, filling the air with</p>
<p>noiseless flight, drifting down the breeze in clouds of brown and</p>
<p>yellow soft-flaked as snow, and piling in mounds against the</p>
<p>fences, ever driven to float helplessly on the irrigation ditches</p>
<p>along the roadside. Hazel and Hattie soon grew used to them</p>
<p>though Possum never ceased being made frantic.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!--who ever heard of butterfly-broke horses?&quot; Billy chaffed.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s worth fifty bucks more on their price.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait till you get across the Oregon line into the Rogue River</p>
<p>Valley,&quot; they were told. &quot;There&#x27;s God&#x27;s Paradise --climate,</p>
<p>scenery, and fruit-farming; fruit ranches that yield two hundred</p>
<p>per cent. on a valuation of five hundred dollars an acre.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!&quot; Billy said, when he had driven on out of hearing; &quot;that&#x27;s</p>
<p>too rich for our digestion.&quot;</p>
<p>And Saxon said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know about apples in the valley of the</p>
<p>moon, but I do know that the yield is ten thousand per cent. of</p>
<p>happiness on a valuation of one Billy, one Saxon, a Hazel, a</p>
<p>Hattie, and a Possum.&quot;</p>
<p>Through Siskiyou County and across high mountains, they came to</p>
<p>Ashland and Medford and camped beside the wild Rogue River.</p>
<p>&quot;This is wonderful and glorious,&quot; pronounced Saxon; &quot;but it is</p>
<p>not the valley of the moon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope, it ain&#x27;t the valley of the moon,&quot; agreed Billy, and he</p>
<p>said it on the evening of the day he hooked a monster steelhead,</p>
<p>standing to his neck in the ice-cold water of the Rogue and</p>
<p>fighting for forty minutes, with screaming reel, ere he drew his</p>
<p>finny prize to the bank and with the scalp-yell of a Comanche</p>
<p>jumped and clutched it by the gills.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Them that looks finds,&#x27;&quot; predicted Saxon, as they drew north</p>
<p>out of Grant&#x27;s Pass, and held north across the mountains and</p>
<p>fruitful Oregon valleys.</p>
<p>One day, in camp by the Umpqua River, Billy bent over to begin</p>
<p>skinning the first deer he had ever shot. He raised his eyes to</p>
<p>Saxon and remarked:</p>
<p>&quot;If I didn&#x27;t know California, I guess Oregon&#x27;d suit me from the</p>
<p>ground up.&quot;</p>
<p>In the evening, replete with deer meat, resting on his elbow and</p>
<p>smoking his after-supper cigarette, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe they ain&#x27;t no valley of the moon. An&#x27; if they ain&#x27;t, what</p>
<p>of it? We could keep on this way forever. I don&#x27;t ask nothing</p>
<p>better.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is a valley of the moon,&quot; Saxon answered BOberly. &quot;And we</p>
<p>are going to find it. We&#x27;ve got to. Why Billy, it would never do,</p>
<p>never to settle down. There would be no little Hazels and little</p>
<p>Hatties, nor little . . . Billies--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor little Saxons,&quot; Billy interjected.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor little Possums,&quot; she hurried on, nodding her head and</p>
<p>reaching out a caressing hand to where the fox terrier was</p>
<p>ecstatically gnawing a deer-rib. A vicious snarl and a wicked</p>
<p>snap that barely missed her fingers were her reward.</p>
<p>&quot;Possum!&quot; she cried in sharp reproof, again extending her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t, &quot; Billy warned. &quot;He can&#x27;t help it, and he&#x27;s likely to get</p>
<p>you next time.&quot;</p>
<p>Even more compelling was the menacing threat that Possum growled,</p>
<p>his jaws close-guarding the bone, eyes blazing insanely, the hair</p>
<p>rising stiffly on his neck.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a good dog that sticks up for its bone,&quot; Billy championed.</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t care to own one that didn&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it&#x27;s my Possum,&quot; Saxon protested. &quot;And he loves me. Besides,</p>
<p>he must love me more than an old bone. And he must mind</p>
<p>me.--Here, you, Possum, give me that bone! Give me that bone,</p>
<p>sir!&quot;</p>
<p>Her hand went out gingerly, and the growl rose in volume and key</p>
<p>till it culminated in a snap.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you it&#x27;s instinct,&quot; Billy repeated. &quot;He does love you,</p>
<p>but he just can&#x27;t help doin&#x27; it. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s got a right to defend his bones from strangers but not from</p>
<p>his mother,&quot; Saxon argued. &quot;I shall make him give up that bone to</p>
<p>me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fox terriers is awful highstrung, Saxon. You&#x27;ll likely get him</p>
<p>hysterical.&quot;</p>
<p>But she was obstinately set in her purpose. She picked up a short</p>
<p>stick of firewood.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, sir, give me that bone.&quot;</p>
<p>She threatened with the stick, and the dog&#x27;s growling became</p>
<p>ferocious. Again he snapped, then crouched back over his bone.</p>
<p>Saxon raised the stick as if to strike him, and he suddenly</p>
<p>abandoned the bone, rolled over on his back at her feet, four</p>
<p>legs in the air, his ears lying meekly back, his eyes swimming</p>
<p>and eloquent with submission and appeal.</p>
<p>&quot;My God!&quot; Billy breathed in solemn awe. &quot;Look at it!--presenting</p>
<p>his solar plexus to you, his vitals an&#x27; his life, all defense</p>
<p>down, as much as sayin&#x27;: &#x27;Here I am&quot; Stamp on me. Kick the life</p>
<p>outa me. I love you, I am your slave, but I just can&#x27;t help</p>
<p>defendin&#x27; my bone. My instinct&#x27;s stronger&#x27;n me. Kill me, but I</p>
<p>can&#x27;t help it.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was melted. Tears were in her eyes as she stooped and</p>
<p>gathered the mite of an animal in her arms. Possum was in a</p>
<p>frenzy of agitation, whining, trembling, writhing, twisting,</p>
<p>licking her face, all for forgiveness.</p>
<p>&quot;Heart of gold with a rose in his mouth,&quot; Saxon crooned, burying</p>
<p>her face in the soft and quivering bundle of sensibilities.</p>
<p>&quot;Mother is sorry. She&#x27;ll never bother you again that way. There,</p>
<p>there, little love. See? There&#x27;s your bone. Take it.&quot;</p>
<p>She put him down, but he hesitated between her and the bone,</p>
<p>patently looking to her for surety of permission, yet continuing</p>
<p>to tremble in the terrible struggle between duty and desire that</p>
<p>seemed tearing him asunder. Not until she repeated that it was</p>
<p>all right and nodded her head consentingly did he go to the bone.</p>
<p>And once, a minute later, he raised his head with a sudden</p>
<p>startle and gazed inquiringly at her. She nodded and smiled, and</p>
<p>Possum, with a happy sigh of satisfaction, dropped his head down</p>
<p>to the precious deer-rib.</p>
<p>&quot;That Mercedes was right when she said men fought over jobs like</p>
<p>dogs over bones,&quot; Billy enunciated slowly. &quot;It&#x27;s instinct. Why, I</p>
<p>couldn&#x27;t no more help reaching my fist to the point of a scab&#x27;s</p>
<p>jaw than could Possum from snappin&#x27; at you. They&#x27;s no explainin&#x27;</p>
<p>it. What a man has to he has to. The fact that he does a thing</p>
<p>shows he had to do it whether he can explain it or not. You</p>
<p>remember Hall couldn&#x27;t explain why he stuck that stick between</p>
<p>Timothy McManus&#x27;s legs in the foot race. What a man has to, he</p>
<p>has to. That&#x27;s all I know about it. I never had no earthly reason</p>
<p>to beat up that lodger we had, Jimmy Harmon. He was a good guy,</p>
<p>square an&#x27; all right. But I just had to, with the strike goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>smash, an&#x27; everything so bitter inside me that I could taste it.</p>
<p>I never told you, but I saw &#x27;m once after I got out--when my arms</p>
<p>was mendin&#x27;. I went down to the roundhouse an&#x27; waited for &#x27;m to</p>
<p>come in off a run, an&#x27; apologized to &#x27;m. Now why did I apologize?</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know, except for the same reason I punched &#x27;m--I just had</p>
<p>to.&quot;</p>
<p>And so Billy expounded the why of like in terms of realism, in</p>
<p>the camp by the Umpqua River, while Possum expounded it, in</p>
<p>similar terms of fang and appetite, on the rib of deer.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI</p>
<p>With Possum on the seat beside her, Saxon drove into the town of</p>
<p>Roseburg. She drove at a walk. At the back of the wagon were tied</p>
<p>two heavy young work-horses. Behind, half a dozen more marched</p>
<p>free, and the rear was brought up by Billy, astride a ninth</p>
<p>horse. All these he shipped from Roseburg to the West Oakland</p>
<p>stables.</p>
<p>It was in the Umpqua Valley that they heard the parable of the</p>
<p>white sparrow. The farmer who told it was elderly and</p>
<p>flourishing. His farm was a model of orderliness and system.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Billy heard neighbors estimate his wealth at a</p>
<p>quarter of a million.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve heard the story of the farmer and the white sparrow&#x27;&quot; he</p>
<p>asked Billy, at dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;Never heard of a white sparrow even,&quot; Billy answered.</p>
<p>&quot;I must say they&#x27;re pretty rare,&quot; the farmer owned. &quot;But here&#x27;s</p>
<p>the story: Once there was a farmer who wasn&#x27;t making much of a</p>
<p>success. Things just didn&#x27;t seem to go right, till at last, one</p>
<p>day, he heard about the wonderful white sparrow. It seems that</p>
<p>the white sparrow comes out only just at daybreak with the first</p>
<p>light of dawn, and that it brings all kinds of good luck to the</p>
<p>farmer that is fortunate enough to catch it. Next morning our</p>
<p>farmer was up at daybreak, and before, looking for it. And, do</p>
<p>you know, he sought for it continually, for months and months,</p>
<p>and never caught even a glimpse of it.&quot; Their host shook his</p>
<p>head. &quot;No; he never found it, but he found so many things about</p>
<p>the farm needing attention, and which he attended to before</p>
<p>breakfast, that before he knew it the farm was prospering, and it</p>
<p>wasn&#x27;t long before the mortgage was paid off and he was starting</p>
<p>a bank account.&quot;</p>
<p>That afternoon, as they drove along, Billy was plunged in a deep</p>
<p>reverie.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I got the point all right,&quot; he said finally. &quot;An&#x27; yet I</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t satisfied. Of course, they wasn&#x27;t a white sparrow, but by</p>
<p>getting up early an&#x27; attendin&#x27; to things he&#x27;d been slack about</p>
<p>before--oh, I got it all right. An&#x27; yet, Saxon, if that&#x27;s what a</p>
<p>farmer&#x27;s life means, I don&#x27;t want to find no moon valley. Life</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t hard work. Daylight to dark, hard at it--might just as well</p>
<p>be in the city. What&#x27;s the difference? A1&#x27; the time you&#x27;ve got to</p>
<p>yourself is for sleepin&#x27;, an&#x27; when you&#x27;re sleepin&#x27; you&#x27;re not</p>
<p>enjoyin&#x27; yourself. An&#x27; what&#x27;s it matter where you sleep, you&#x27;re</p>
<p>deado. Might as well be dead an&#x27; done with it as work your head</p>
<p>off that way. I&#x27;d sooner stick to the road, an&#x27; shoot a deer an&#x27;</p>
<p>catch a trout once in a while, an&#x27; lie on my back in the shade,</p>
<p>an&#x27; laugh with you an&#x27; have fun with you, an&#x27; . . . an&#x27; go</p>
<p>swimmin&#x27;. An&#x27; I &#x27;m a willin&#x27; worker, too. But they&#x27;s all the</p>
<p>difference in the world between a decent amount of work an&#x27;</p>
<p>workin&#x27; your head off.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was in full accord. She looked back on her years of toil</p>
<p>and contrasted them with the joyous life she had lived on the</p>
<p>road.</p>
<p>&quot;We don&#x27;t want to be rich,&quot; she said. &quot;Let them hunt their white</p>
<p>sparrows in the Sacramento islands and the irrigation valleys.</p>
<p>When we get up early in the valley of the moon, it will be to</p>
<p>hear the birds sing and sing with them. And if we work hard at</p>
<p>times, it will be only so that we&#x27;ll have more time to play. And</p>
<p>when you go swimming I &#x27;m going with you. And we&#x27;ll play so hard</p>
<p>that we&#x27;ll be glad to work for relaxation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I &#x27;m gettin&#x27; plumb dried out,&quot; Billy announced, mopping the</p>
<p>sweat from his sunburned forehead. &quot;What d&#x27;ye say we head for the</p>
<p>coast?&quot;</p>
<p>West they turned, dropping down wild mountain gorges from the</p>
<p>height of land of the interior valleys. So fearful was the road,</p>
<p>that, on one stretch of seven miles, they passed ten broken-down</p>
<p>automobiles. Billy would not force the mares and promptly camped</p>
<p>beside a brawling stream from which he whipped two trout at a</p>
<p>time. Here, Saxon caught her first big trout. She had been</p>
<p>accustomed to landing them up to nine and ten inches, and the</p>
<p>screech of the reel when the big one was hooked caused her to cry</p>
<p>out in startled surprise. Billy came up the riffle to her and</p>
<p>gave counsel. Several minutes later, cheeks flushed and eyes</p>
<p>dancing with excitement, Saxon dragged the big fellow carefully</p>
<p>from the water&#x27;s edge into the dry sand. Here it threw the hook</p>
<p>out and flopped tremendously until she fell upon it and captured</p>
<p>it in her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Sixteen inches,&quot; Billy said, as she held it up proudly for</p>
<p>inspection. &quot;--Hey!--what are you goin&#x27; to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wash off the sand, of course,&quot; was her answer.</p>
<p>&quot;Better put it in the basket,&quot; he advised, then closed his mouth</p>
<p>and grimly watched.</p>
<p>She stooped by the side of the stream and dipped in the splendid</p>
<p>fish. It flopped, there was a convulsive movement on her part,</p>
<p>and it was gone.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Saxon cried in chagrin.</p>
<p>&quot;Them that finds should hold,&quot; quoth Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care,&quot; she replied. &quot;It was a bigger one than you ever</p>
<p>caught anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I &#x27;m not denyin&#x27; you&#x27;re a peach at fishin&#x27;,&quot; he drawled.</p>
<p>&quot;You caught me, didn&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know about that,&quot; she retorted. &quot;Maybe it was like the</p>
<p>man who was arrested for catching trout out of season. His</p>
<p>defense was self defense.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy pondered, but did not see.</p>
<p>&quot;The trout attacked him,&quot; she explained.</p>
<p>Billy grinned. Fifteen minutes later he said:</p>
<p>&quot;You sure handed me a hot one.&quot;</p>
<p>The sky was overcast, and, as they drove along the bank of the</p>
<p>Coquille River, the fog suddenly enveloped them.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoof!&quot; Billy exhaled joyfully. &quot;Ain&#x27;t it great! I can feel</p>
<p>myself moppin&#x27; it up like a dry sponge. I never appreciated fog</p>
<p>before.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon held out her arms to receive it, making motions as if she</p>
<p>were bathing in the gray mist.</p>
<p>&quot;I never thought I&#x27;d grow tired of the sun,&quot; she said; &quot;but we&#x27;ve</p>
<p>had more than our share the last few weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since we hit the Sacramento Valley,&quot; Billy affirmed. &quot;Too</p>
<p>much sun ain&#x27;t good. I&#x27;ve worked that out. Sunshine is like</p>
<p>liquor. Did you ever notice how good you felt when the sun come</p>
<p>out after a week of cloudy weather, Well, that sunshine was just</p>
<p>like a jolt of whiskey. Had the same effect. Made you feel good</p>
<p>all over. Now, when you&#x27;re swimmin&#x27;, an&#x27; come out an&#x27; lay in the</p>
<p>sun, how good you feel. That&#x27;s because you&#x27;re lappin&#x27; up a</p>
<p>sun-cocktail. But suppose you lay there in the sand a couple of</p>
<p>hours. You don&#x27;t feel so good. You&#x27;re so slow-movin&#x27; it takes you</p>
<p>a long time to dress. You go home draggin&#x27; your legs an&#x27; feelin&#x27;</p>
<p>rotten, with all the life sapped outa you. What&#x27;s that? It&#x27;s the</p>
<p>katzenjammer. You&#x27;ve been soused to the ears in sunshine, like so</p>
<p>much whiskey, an&#x27; now you&#x27;re payin&#x27; for it. That&#x27;s straight.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s why fog in the climate is best.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then we&#x27;ve been drunk for months, &quot; Saxon said. &quot;And now we&#x27;re</p>
<p>going to sober up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You bet. Why, Saxon, I can do two days&#x27; work in one in this</p>
<p>climate.--Look at the mares. Blame me if they ain&#x27;t perkin&#x27; up</p>
<p>already.&quot;</p>
<p>Vainly Saxon&#x27;s eye roved the pine forest in search of her beloved</p>
<p>redwoods. They would find them down in California, they were told</p>
<p>in the town of Bandon.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we&#x27;re too far north,&quot; said Saxon. &quot;We must go south to find</p>
<p>our valley of the moon.&quot;</p>
<p>And south they went, along roads that steadily grew worse,</p>
<p>through the dairy country of Langlois and through thick pine</p>
<p>forests to Port Orford, where Saxon picked jeweled agates on the</p>
<p>beach while Billy caught enormous rockcod. No railroads had yet</p>
<p>penetrated this wild region, and the way south grew wilder and</p>
<p>wilder. At Gold Beach they encountered their old friend, the</p>
<p>Rogue River, which they ferried across where it entered the</p>
<p>Pacific. Still wilder became the country, still more terrible the</p>
<p>road, still farther apart the isolated farms and clearings.</p>
<p>And here were neither Asiatics nor Europeans. The scant</p>
<p>population consisted of the original settlers and their</p>
<p>descendants. More than one old man or woman Saxon talked with,</p>
<p>who could remember the trip across the Plains with the plodding</p>
<p>oxen. West they had fared until the Pacific itself had stopped</p>
<p>them, and here they had made their clearings, built their rude</p>
<p>houses, and settled. In them Farthest West had been reached. Old</p>
<p>customs had changed little. There were no railways. No automobile</p>
<p>as yet had ventured their perilous roads. Eastward, between them</p>
<p>and the populous interior valleys, lay the wilderness of the</p>
<p>Coast Range--a game paradise, Billy heard; though he declared</p>
<p>that the very road he traveled was game paradise enough for him.</p>
<p>Had he not halted the horses, turned the reins over to Saxon, and</p>
<p>shot an eight-pronged buck from the wagon-seat?</p>
<p>South of Gold Beach, climbing a narrow road through the virgin</p>
<p>forest, they heard from far above the jingle of bells. A hundred</p>
<p>yards farther on Billy found a place wide enough to turn out.</p>
<p>Here he waited, while the merry bells, descending the mountain,</p>
<p>rapidly came near. They heard the grind of brakes, the soft thud</p>
<p>of horses&#x27; hoofs, once a sharp cry of the driver, and once a</p>
<p>woman&#x27;s laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;Some driver, some driver,&quot; Billy muttered. &quot;I take my hat off to</p>
<p>&#x27;m whoever he is, hittin&#x27; a pace like that on a road like</p>
<p>this.--Listen to that! He&#x27;s got powerful brakes.-- Zocie! That</p>
<p>WAS a chuck-hole! Some springs, Saxon, some springs!&quot;</p>
<p>Where the road zigzagged above, they glimpsed through the trees</p>
<p>four sorrel horses trotting swiftly, and the flying wheels of a</p>
<p>small, tan-painted trap.</p>
<p>At the bend of the road the leaders appeared again, swinging wide</p>
<p>on the curve, the wheelers flashed into view, and the light</p>
<p>two-seated rig; then the whole affair straightened out and</p>
<p>thundered down upon them across a narrow plank-bridge. In the</p>
<p>front seat were a man and woman; in the rear seat a Japanese was</p>
<p>squeezed in among suit cases, rods, guns, saddles, and a</p>
<p>typewriter case, while above him and all about him, fastened most</p>
<p>intricately, sprouted a prodigious crop of deer- and elk-horns.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s Mr. and Mrs. Hastings,&quot; Saxon cried.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa!&quot; Hastings yelled, putting on the brake and gathering his</p>
<p>horses in to a stop alongside. Greetings flew back and forth, in</p>
<p>which the Japanese, whom they had last seen on the Roamer at Rio</p>
<p>Vista, gave and reeeived his share.</p>
<p>&quot;Different from the Sacramento islands, eh?&quot; Hastings said to</p>
<p>Saxon. &quot;Nothing but old American stock in these mountains. And</p>
<p>they haven&#x27;t changed any. As John Fox, Jr., said, they&#x27;re our</p>
<p>contemporary ancestors. Our old folks were just like them.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hastings, between them, told of their long drive.</p>
<p>They were out two months then, and intended to continue north</p>
<p>through Oregon and Washington to the Canadian boundary.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we&#x27;ll ship our horses and come home by train,&quot; concluded</p>
<p>Hastings.</p>
<p>&quot;But the way you drive you oughta be a whole lot further along</p>
<p>than this,&quot; Billy criticized.</p>
<p>&quot;But we keep stopping off everywhere,&quot; Mrs. Hastings explained.</p>
<p>&quot;We went in to the Hoopa Reservation,&quot; said Mr. Elastings, &quot; and</p>
<p>canoed down the Trinity and Klamath Rivers to the ocean. And just</p>
<p>now we&#x27;ve come out from two weeks in the real wilds of Curry</p>
<p>County.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must go in,&quot; Hastings advised. &quot;You&#x27;ll get to Mountain Ranch</p>
<p>to-night. And you can turn in from there. No roads, though.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll have to pack your horses. But it&#x27;s full of game. I shot</p>
<p>five mountain lions and two bear, to say nothing of deer. And</p>
<p>there are small herds of elk, too.--No; I didn&#x27;t shoot any.</p>
<p>They&#x27;re protected. These horns I got from the old hunters. I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>tell you all about it.&quot;</p>
<p>And while the men talked, Saxon and Mrs. Hastings were not idle.</p>
<p>&quot;Found your valley of the moon yet?&quot; the writer&#x27;s wife asked, as</p>
<p>they were saying good-by.</p>
<p>Saxon shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;You will find it if you go far enough; and be sure you go as far</p>
<p>as Sonoma Valley and our ranch. Then, if you haven&#x27;t found it</p>
<p>yet, we&#x27;ll see what we can do.&quot;</p>
<p>Three weeks later, with a bigger record of mountain lions and</p>
<p>bear than Hastings&#x27; to his credit, Billy emerged from Curry</p>
<p>County and drove across the line into California. At once Saxon</p>
<p>found herself among the redwoods. But they were redwoods</p>
<p>unbelievable. Billy stopped the wagon, got out, and paced around</p>
<p>one.</p>
<p>&quot;Forty-five feet,&quot; he announced. &quot;That&#x27;s fifteen in diameter. And</p>
<p>they&#x27;re all like it only bigger. No; there&#x27;s a runt. It&#x27;s only</p>
<p>about nine feet through. An&#x27; they&#x27;re hundreds of feet tall.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When I die, Billy, you must bury me in a redwood grove,&quot; Saxon</p>
<p>adjured.</p>
<p>&quot;I ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to let you die before I do,&quot; he assured her. &quot;An&#x27;</p>
<p>then we&#x27;ll leave it in our wills for us both to be buried that</p>
<p>way.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII</p>
<p>South they held along the coast, hunting, fishing, swimming, and</p>
<p>horse-buying. Billy shipped his purchases on the coasting</p>
<p>steamers. Through Del Norte and Humboldt counties they went, and</p>
<p>through Mendocino into Sonoma --counties larger than Eastern</p>
<p>states--threading the giant woods, whipping innumerable</p>
<p>trout-streams, and crossing countless rich valleys. Ever Saxon</p>
<p>sought the valley of the moon. Sometimes, when all seemed fair,</p>
<p>the lack was a railroad, sometimes madrono and manzanita trees,</p>
<p>and, usually, there was too much fog.</p>
<p>&quot;We do want a sun-cocktail once in a while,&quot; she told Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yep,&quot; was his answer. &quot;Too much fog might make us soggy. What</p>
<p>we&#x27;re after is betwixt an&#x27; between, an&#x27; we&#x27;ll have to get back</p>
<p>from the coast a ways to find it.&quot;</p>
<p>This was in the fall of the year, and they turned their backs on</p>
<p>the Pacific at old Fort Ross and entered the Russian River</p>
<p>Valley, far below Ukiah, by way of Cazadero and Guerneville. At</p>
<p>Santa Rosa Billy was delayed with the shipping of several horses,</p>
<p>so that it was not until afternoon that he drove south and east</p>
<p>for Sonoma Valley.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess we&#x27;ll no more than make Sonoma Valley when it&#x27;ll be time</p>
<p>to camp,&quot; he said, measuring the sun with his eye. &quot;This is</p>
<p>called Bennett Valley. You cross a divide from it and come out at</p>
<p>Glen Ellen. Now this is a mighty pretty valley, if anybody should</p>
<p>ask you. An&#x27; that&#x27;s some nifty mountain over there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The mountain is all right,&quot; Saxon adjudged. &quot;But all the rest of</p>
<p>the hills are too bare. And I don&#x27;t see any big trees. It takes</p>
<p>rich soil to make big trees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I ain&#x27;t sayin&#x27; it&#x27;s the valley of the moon by a long ways.</p>
<p>All the same, Saxon, that&#x27;s some mountain. Look at the timber on</p>
<p>it. I bet they&#x27;s deer there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder where we&#x27;ll spend this winter,&quot; Saxon remarked.</p>
<p>&quot;D&#x27;ye know, I&#x27;ve just been thinkin&#x27; the same thing. Let&#x27;s winter</p>
<p>at Carmel. Mark Hall&#x27;s back, an&#x27; so is Jim Hazard. What d&#x27;ye</p>
<p>say?&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Only you won&#x27;t be the odd-job man this time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nope. We can make trips in good weather horse-buyin&#x27;,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>confirmed, his face beaming with self-satisfaction. &quot;An&#x27; if that</p>
<p>walkin&#x27; poet of the Marble House is around, I&#x27;ll sure get the</p>
<p>gloves on with &#x27;m just in memory of the time he walked me off my</p>
<p>legs--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; Saxon cried. &quot;Look, Billy! Look!&quot;</p>
<p>Around a bend in the road came a man in a sulky, driving a heavy</p>
<p>stallion. The animal was a bright chestnut-sorrel, with</p>
<p>cream-colored mane and tail. The tail almost swept the ground,</p>
<p>while the mane was so thick that it crested out of the neck and</p>
<p>flowed down, long and wavy. He scented the mares and stopped</p>
<p>short, head flung up and armfuls of creamy mane tossing in the</p>
<p>breeze. He bent his head until flaring nostrils brushed impatient</p>
<p>knees, and between the fine-pointed ears could be seen a mighty</p>
<p>and incredible curve of neck. Again he tossed his head, fretting</p>
<p>against the bit as the driver turned widely aside for safety in</p>
<p>passing. They could see the blue glaze like a sheen on the</p>
<p>surface of the horse&#x27;s bright, wild eyes, and Billy closed a wary</p>
<p>thumb on his reins and himself turned widely. He held up his hand</p>
<p>in signal, and the driver of the stallion stopped when well past,</p>
<p>and over his shoulder talked draught-horses with Billy.</p>
<p>Among other things, Billy learned that the stallion&#x27;s name was</p>
<p>Barbarossa, that the driver was the owner, and that Santa Rosa</p>
<p>was his headquarters.</p>
<p>&quot;There are two ways to Sonoma Valley from here,&quot; the man</p>
<p>directed. &quot;When you come to the crossroads the turn to the left</p>
<p>will take you to Glen Ellen by Bennett Peak-- that&#x27;s it there.&quot;</p>
<p>Rising from rolling stubble fields, Bennett Peak towered hot in</p>
<p>the sun, a row of bastion hills leaning against its base. But</p>
<p>hills and mountains on that side showed bare and heated, though</p>
<p>beautiful with the sunburnt tawniness of California.</p>
<p>&quot;The turn to the right will take you to Glen Ellen, too, only</p>
<p>it&#x27;s longer and steeper grades. But your mares don&#x27;t look as</p>
<p>though it&#x27;d bother them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which is the prettiest way?&quot; Saxon asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, the right hand road, by all means,&quot; said the man. &quot;That&#x27;s</p>
<p>Sonoma Mountain there, and the road skirts it pretty well up, and</p>
<p>goes through Cooper&#x27;s Grove.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy did not start immediately after they had said good-by, and</p>
<p>he and Saxon, heads over shoulders, watched the roused Barbarossa</p>
<p>plunging mutinously on toward Santa Rosa.</p>
<p>&quot;Gee!&quot; Billy said. &quot;I&#x27;d like to be up here next spring.</p>
<p>At the crossroads Billy hesitated and looked at Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;What if it is longer?&quot; she said. &quot;Look how beautiful it is--all</p>
<p>covered with green woods; and I just know those are redwoods in</p>
<p>the canyons. You never can tell. The valley of the moon might be</p>
<p>right up there somewhere. And it would never do to miss it just</p>
<p>in order to save half an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>They took the turn to the right and began crossing a series of</p>
<p>steep foothills. As they approached the mountain there were signs</p>
<p>of a greater abundance of water. They drove beside a running</p>
<p>stream, and, though the vineyards on the hills were summer-dry,</p>
<p>the farmhouses in the hollows and on the levels were grouped</p>
<p>about with splendid trees.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it sounds funny,&quot; Saxon observed; &quot;but I &#x27;m beginning to</p>
<p>love that mountain already. It almost seems as if I d seen it</p>
<p>before, somehow, it&#x27;s so all-around satisfying--oh!&quot;</p>
<p>Crossing a bridge and rounding a sharp turn, they were suddenly</p>
<p>enveloped in a mysterious coolness and gloom. All about them</p>
<p>arose stately trunks of redwood. The forest floor was a rosy</p>
<p>carpet of autumn fronds. Occasional shafts of sunlight,</p>
<p>penetrating the deep shade, warmed the somberness of the grove.</p>
<p>Alluring paths led off among the trees and into cozy nooks made</p>
<p>by circles of red columns growing around the dust of vanished</p>
<p>ancestors--witnessing the titantic dimensions of those ancestors</p>
<p>by the girth of the circles in which they stood.</p>
<p>Out of the grove they pulled to the steep divide, which was no</p>
<p>more than a buttress of Sonoma Mountain. The way led on through</p>
<p>rolling uplands and across small dips and canyons, all well</p>
<p>wooded and a-drip with water. In places the road was muddy from</p>
<p>wayside springs.</p>
<p>&quot;The mountain&#x27;s a sponge,&quot; said Billy. &quot;Here it is, the tail-end</p>
<p>of dry summer, an&#x27; the ground&#x27;s just leakin&#x27; everywhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know I&#x27;ve never been here before,&quot; Saxon communed aloud. &quot;But</p>
<p>it&#x27;s all so familiar! So I must have dreamed it. And there&#x27;s</p>
<p>madronos!--a whole grove! And manzanita! Why, I feel just as if I</p>
<p>was coming home.... Oh, Billy, if it should turn out to be our</p>
<p>valley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Plastered against the side of a mountain?&quot; he queried, with a</p>
<p>skeptical laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;No; I don&#x27;t mean that. I mean on the way to our valley. Because</p>
<p>the way--all ways--to our valley must be beautiful. And this;</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve seen it all before, dreamed it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s great,&quot; he said sympathetically. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t trade a square</p>
<p>mile of this kind of country for the whole Sacramento Valley,</p>
<p>with the river islands thrown in and Middle River for good</p>
<p>measure. If they ain&#x27;t deer up there, I miss my guess. An&#x27; where</p>
<p>they&#x27;s springs they&#x27;s streams, an&#x27; streams means trout.&quot;</p>
<p>They passed a large and comfortable farmhouse, surrounded by</p>
<p>wandering barns and cow-sheds, went on under forest arches, and</p>
<p>emerged beside a field with which Saxon was instantly enchanted.</p>
<p>It flowed in a gentle concave from the road up the mountain, its</p>
<p>farther boundary an unbroken line of timber. The field glowed</p>
<p>like rough gold in the approaching sunset, and near the middle of</p>
<p>it stood a solitary great redwood, with blasted top suggesting a</p>
<p>nesting eyrie for eagles. The timber beyond clothed the mountain</p>
<p>in solid green to what they took to be the top. But, as they</p>
<p>drove on, Saxon, looking back upon what she called her field, saw</p>
<p>the real summit of Sonoma towering beyond, the mountain behind</p>
<p>her field a mere spur upon the side of the larger mass.</p>
<p>Ahead and toward the right, across sheer ridges of the mountains,</p>
<p>separated by deep green canyons and broadening lower down into</p>
<p>rolling orchards and vineyards, they caught their first sight of</p>
<p>Sonoma Valley and the wild mountains that rimmed its eastern</p>
<p>side. To the left they gazed across a golden land of small hills</p>
<p>and valleys. Beyond, to the north, they glimpsed another portion</p>
<p>of the valley, and, still beyond, the opposing wall of the</p>
<p>valley-- a range of mountains, the highest of which reared its</p>
<p>red and battered ancient crater against a rosy and mellowing sky.</p>
<p>From north to southeast, the mountain rim curved in the</p>
<p>brightness of the sun, while Saxon and Billy were already in the</p>
<p>shadow of evening. He looked at Saxon, noted the ravished ecstasy</p>
<p>of her face, and stopped the horses. All the eastern sky was</p>
<p>blushing to rose, which descended upon the mountains, touching</p>
<p>them with wine and ruby. Sonoma Valley began to fill with a</p>
<p>purple flood, laying the mountain bases, rising, inundating,</p>
<p>drowning them in its purple. Saxon pointed in silence, indicating</p>
<p>that the purple flood was the sunset shadow of Sonoma Mountain.</p>
<p>Billy nodded, then chirruped to the mares, and the descent began</p>
<p>through a warm and colorful twilight.</p>
<p>On the elevated sections of the road they felt the cool,</p>
<p>delicious breeze from the Pacific forty miles away; while from</p>
<p>each little dip and hollow came warm breaths of autumn earth,</p>
<p>spicy with sunburnt grass and fallen leaves and passing flowers.</p>
<p>They came to the rim of a deep canyon that seemed to penetrate to</p>
<p>the heart of Sonoma Mountain. Again, with no word spoken, merely</p>
<p>from watching Saxon, Billy stopped the wagon. The canyon was</p>
<p>wildly beautiful. Tall redwoods lined its entire length. On its</p>
<p>farther rim stood three rugged knolls covered with dense woods of</p>
<p>spruce and oak. From between the knolls, a feeder to the main</p>
<p>canyon and likewise fringed with redwoods, emerged a smaller</p>
<p>canyon. Billy pointed to a stubble field that lay at the feet of</p>
<p>the knolls.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s in fields like that I&#x27;ve seen my mares a-pasturing,&quot; he</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>They dropped down into the canyon, the road following a stream</p>
<p>that sang under maples and alders. The sunset fires, refracted</p>
<p>from the cloud-driftage of the autumn sky, bathed the canyon with</p>
<p>crimson, in which ruddy-limbed mandronos and wine-wooded</p>
<p>manzanitas burned and smoldered. The air was aromatic with</p>
<p>laurel. Wild grape vines bridged the stream from tree to tree.</p>
<p>Oaks of many sorts were veiled in lacy Spanish moss. Ferns and</p>
<p>brakes grew lush beside the stream. From somewhere came the</p>
<p>plaint of a mourning dove. Fifty feet above the ground, almost</p>
<p>over their heads, a Douglas squirrel crossed the road--a flash of</p>
<p>gray between two trees; and they marked the continuance of its</p>
<p>aerial passage by the bending of the boughs.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve got a hunch,&quot; said Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me say it first,&quot; Saxon begged.</p>
<p>He waited, his eyes on her face as she gazed about her in</p>
<p>rapture.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ve found our valley,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Was that it?&quot;</p>
<p>He nodded, but checked speech at sight of a small boy driving a</p>
<p>cow up the road, a preposterously big shotgun in one hand, in the</p>
<p>other as preposterously big a jackrabbit.  &quot;How far to Glen</p>
<p>Ellen?&quot; Billy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Mile an&#x27; a half,&quot; was the answer.</p>
<p>&quot;What creek is this?&quot; inquired Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;Wild Water. It empties into Sonoma Creek half a mile down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trout?&quot;--this from Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;If you know how to catch &#x27;em,&quot; grinned the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;Deer up the mountain?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It ain&#x27;t open season,&quot; the boy evaded.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess you never shot a deer,&quot; Billy slyly baited, and was</p>
<p>rewarded with:</p>
<p>&quot;I got the horns to show.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Deer shed their horns,&quot; Billy teased on. &quot;Anybody can find &#x27;em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I got the meat on mine. It ain&#x27;t dry yet--&quot;</p>
<p>The boy broke off, gazing with shocked eyes into the pit Billy</p>
<p>had dug for him.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right, sonny,&quot; Billy laughed, as he drove on. &quot;I ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>the game warden. I &#x27;m buyin&#x27; horses.&quot;</p>
<p>More leaping tree squirrels, more ruddy madronos and majestic</p>
<p>oaks, more fairy circles of redwoods, and, still beside the</p>
<p>singing stream, they passed a gate by the roadside. Before it</p>
<p>stood a rural mail box, on which was lettered &quot;Edmund Hale.&quot;</p>
<p>Standing under the rustic arch, leaning upon the gate, a man and</p>
<p>woman composed a pieture so arresting and beautiful that Saxon</p>
<p>caught her breath. They were side by side, the delicate hand of</p>
<p>the woman curled in the hand of the man, which looked as if made</p>
<p>to confer benedictions. His face bore out this impression--a</p>
<p>beautiful-browed countenance, with large, benevolent gray eyes</p>
<p>under a wealth of white hair that shone like spun glass. He was</p>
<p>fair and large; the little woman beside him was daintily wrought.</p>
<p>She was saffron-brown, as a woman of the white race can well be,</p>
<p>with smiling eyes of bluest blue. In quaint sage-green draperies,</p>
<p>she seemed a flower, with her small vivid face irresistibly</p>
<p>reminding Saxon of a springtime wake-robin.</p>
<p>Perhaps the picture made by Saxon and Billy was equally arresting</p>
<p>and beautiful, as they drove down through the golden end of day.</p>
<p>The two couples had eyes only for each other. The little woman</p>
<p>beamed joyously. The man&#x27;s face glowed into the benediction that</p>
<p>had trembled there. To Saxon, like the field up the mountain,</p>
<p>like the mountain itself, it seemed that she had always known</p>
<p>this adorable pair. She knew that she loved them.</p>
<p>&quot;How d&#x27;ye do,&quot; said Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;You blessed children,&quot; said the man. &quot;I wonder if you know how</p>
<p>dear you look sitting there.&quot;</p>
<p>That was all. The wagon had passed by, rustling down the road,</p>
<p>which was carpeted with fallen leaves of maple, oak, and alder.</p>
<p>Then they came to the meeting of the two creeks.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, what a place for a home,&quot; Saxon cried, pointing across Wild</p>
<p>Water. &quot;See, Billy, on that bench there above the meadow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a rich bottom, Saxon; and so is the bench rich. Look at the</p>
<p>big trees on it. An&#x27; they&#x27;s sure to be springs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Drive over,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Forsaking the main road, they crossed Wild Water on a narrow</p>
<p>bridge and continued along an ancient, rutted road that ran</p>
<p>beside an equally ancient worm-fence of split redwood rails. They</p>
<p>came to a gate, open and off its hinges, through which the road</p>
<p>led out on the bench.</p>
<p>&quot;This is it--I know it,&quot; Saxon said with conviction. &quot;Drive in,</p>
<p>Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>A small, whitewashed farmhouse with broken windows showed through</p>
<p>the trees.</p>
<p>&quot;Talk about your madronos--&quot;</p>
<p>Billy pointed to the father of all madronos, six feet in diameter</p>
<p>at its base, sturdy and sound, which stood before the house.</p>
<p>They spoke in low tones as they passed around the house under</p>
<p>great oak trees and came to a stop before a small barn. They did</p>
<p>not wait to unharness. Tying the horses, they started to explore.</p>
<p>The pitch from the bench to the meadow was steep yet thickly</p>
<p>wooded with oaks and manzanita. As they crashed through the</p>
<p>underbrush they startled a score of quail into flight.</p>
<p>&quot;How about game?&quot; Saxon queried.</p>
<p>Billy grinned, and fell to examining a spring which bubbled a</p>
<p>clear stream into the meadow. Here the ground was sunbaked and</p>
<p>wide open in a multitude of cracks.</p>
<p>Disappointment leaped into Saxon&#x27;s face, but Billy, crumbling a</p>
<p>clod between his fingers, had not made up his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s rich,&quot; he pronounced; &quot;--the cream of the soil that&#x27;s been</p>
<p>washin&#x27; down from the hills for ten thousan&#x27; years. But--&quot;</p>
<p>He broke off, stared all about, studying the configuration of the</p>
<p>meadow, crossed it to the redwood trees beyond, then came back.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s no good as it is,&quot; he said. &quot;But it&#x27;s the best ever if it&#x27;s</p>
<p>handled right. All it needs is a little common sense an&#x27; a lot of</p>
<p>drainage. This meadow&#x27;s a natural basin not yet filled level.</p>
<p>They&#x27;s a sharp slope through the redwoods to the creek. Come on,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll show you.&quot;</p>
<p>They went through the redwoods and came out on Sonoma Creek. At</p>
<p>this spot was no singing. The stream poured into a quiet pool.</p>
<p>The willows on their side brushed the water. The opposite side</p>
<p>was a steep bank. Billy measured the height of the bank with his</p>
<p>eye, the depth of the water with a driftwood pole.</p>
<p>&quot;Fifteen feet,&quot; he announced. &quot;That allows all kinds of</p>
<p>high-divin&#x27; from the bank. An&#x27; it&#x27;s a hundred yards of a swim up</p>
<p>an&#x27; down.&quot;</p>
<p>They followed down the pool. It emptied in a riffle, across</p>
<p>exposed bedrock, into another pool. As they looked, a trout</p>
<p>flashed into the air and back, leaving a widening ripple on the</p>
<p>quiet surface.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess we won&#x27;t winter in Carmel,&quot; Billy said. &quot;This place was</p>
<p>specially manufactured for us. In the morning I&#x27;ll find out who</p>
<p>owns it.&quot;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, feeding the horses, he called Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>attention to a locomotive whistle.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ve got your railroad,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s a train pulling into</p>
<p>Glen Ellen, an&#x27; it&#x27;s only a mile from here.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was dozing off to sleep under the blankets when Billy</p>
<p>aroused her.</p>
<p>&quot;Suppose the guy that owns it won&#x27;t sell?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There isn&#x27;t the slightest doubt,&quot; Saxon answered with unruffled</p>
<p>certainty. &quot;This is our place. I know it.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII</p>
<p>They were awakened by Possum, who was indignantly reproaching a</p>
<p>tree squirrel for not coming down to be killed. The squirrel</p>
<p>chattered garrulous remarks that drove Possum into a mad attempt</p>
<p>to climb the tree. Billy and Saxon giggled and hugged each other</p>
<p>at the terrier&#x27;s frenzy.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is goin&#x27; to be our place, they&#x27;ll be no shootin&#x27; of tree</p>
<p>squirrels,&quot; Billy said.</p>
<p>Saxon pressed his hand and sat up. From beneath the bench came</p>
<p>the cry of a meadow lark.</p>
<p>&quot;There isn&#x27;t anything left to be desired,&quot; she sighed happily.</p>
<p>&quot;Except the deed,&quot; Billy corrected.</p>
<p>After a hasty breakfast, they started to explore, running the</p>
<p>irregular boundaries of the place and repeatedly crossing it from</p>
<p>rail fence to creek and back again. Seven springs they found</p>
<p>along the foot of the bench on the edge of the meadow.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s your water supply,&quot; Billy said. &quot;Drain the meadow, work</p>
<p>the soil up, and with fertilizer and all that water you can grow</p>
<p>crops the year round. There must be five acres of it, an&#x27; I</p>
<p>wouldn&#x27;t trade it for Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s.&quot;</p>
<p>They were standing in the old orchard, on the bench where they</p>
<p>had counted twenty-seven trees, neglected but of generous girth.</p>
<p>&quot;And on top the bench, back of the house, we can grow berries.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon paused, considering a new thought &quot;If only Mrs. Mortimer</p>
<p>would come up and advise us!--Do you think she would, Billy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure she would. It ain&#x27;t more &#x27;n four hours&#x27; run from San Jose.</p>
<p>But first we&#x27;ll get our hooks into the place. Then you can write</p>
<p>to her.&quot;</p>
<p>Sonoma Creek gave the long boundary to the little farm, two sides</p>
<p>were worm fenced, and the fourth side was Wild Water.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, we&#x27;ll have that beautiful man and woman for neighbors,&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon recollected. &quot;Wild Water will be the dividing line between</p>
<p>their place and ours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It ain&#x27;t ours yet,&quot; Billy commented. &quot;Let&#x27;s go and call on &#x27;em.</p>
<p>They&#x27;ll be able to tell us all about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s just as good as,&quot; she replied. &quot;The big thing has been the</p>
<p>finding. And whoever owns it doesn&#x27;t care much for it. It hasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>been lived in for a long time. And --Oh, Billy--are you</p>
<p>satisfied!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With every bit of it,&quot; he answered frankly, &quot;as far as it goes.</p>
<p>But the trouble is, it don&#x27;t go far enough.&quot;</p>
<p>The disappointment in her face spurred him to renunciation of his</p>
<p>particular dream.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll buy it--that&#x27;s settled,&quot; he said. &quot;But outside the meadow,</p>
<p>they&#x27;s so much woods that they&#x27;s little pasture--not more &#x27;n</p>
<p>enough for a couple of horses an&#x27; a cow. But I don&#x27;t care. We</p>
<p>can&#x27;t have everything, an&#x27; what they is is almighty good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let us call it a starter,&quot; she consoled. &quot;Later on we can add to</p>
<p>it--maybe the land alongside that runs up the Wild Water to the</p>
<p>three knolls we saw yesterday &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where I seen my horses pasturin&#x27;,&quot; he remembered, with a flash</p>
<p>of eye. &quot;Why not? So much has come true since we hit the road,</p>
<p>maybe that&#x27;ll come true, too.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll work for it, Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll work like hell for it,&quot; he said grimly.</p>
<p>They passed through the rustic gate and along a path that wound</p>
<p>through wild woods. There was no sign of the house until they</p>
<p>came abruptly upon it, bowered among the trees. It was</p>
<p>eight-sided, and so justly proportioned that its two stories made</p>
<p>no show of height. The house belonged there. It might have sprung</p>
<p>from the soil just as the trees had. There were no formal</p>
<p>grounds. The wild grew to the doors. The low porch of the main</p>
<p>entrance was raised only a step from the ground. &quot;Trillium</p>
<p>Covert,&quot; they read, in quaint carved letters under the eave of</p>
<p>the porch.</p>
<p>&quot;Come right upstairs, you dears,&quot; a voice called from above, in</p>
<p>response to Saxon&#x27;s knock.</p>
<p>Stepping back and looking up, she beheld the little lady smiling</p>
<p>down from a sleeping-porch. Clad in a rosy-tissued and flowing</p>
<p>house gown, she again reminded Saxon of a flower.</p>
<p>&quot;Just push the front door open and find your way,&quot; was the</p>
<p>direction.</p>
<p>Saxon led, with Billy at her heels. They came into a room bright</p>
<p>with windows, where a big log smoldered in a rough-stone</p>
<p>fireplace. On the stone slab above stood a huge Mexican jar,</p>
<p>filled with autumn branches and trailing fluffy smoke-vine. The</p>
<p>walls were finished in warm natural woods, stained but without</p>
<p>polish. The air was aromatic with clean wood odors. A walnut</p>
<p>organ loomed in a shallow corner of the room. All corners were</p>
<p>shallow in this octagonal dwelling. In another corner were many</p>
<p>rows of books. Through the windows, across a low couch</p>
<p>indubitably made for use, could be seen a restful picture of</p>
<p>autumn trees and yellow grasses, threaded by wellworn paths that</p>
<p>ran here and there over the tiny estate. A delightful little</p>
<p>stairway wound past more windows to the upper story. Here the</p>
<p>little lady greeted them and led them into what Saxon knew at</p>
<p>once was her room. The two octagonal sides of the house which</p>
<p>showed in this wide room were given wholly to windows. Under the</p>
<p>long sill, to the floor, were shelves of books. Books lay here</p>
<p>and there, in the disorder of use, on work table, couch and desk.</p>
<p>On a sill by an open window, a jar of autumn leaves breathed the</p>
<p>charm of the sweet brown wife, who seated herself in a tiny</p>
<p>rattan chair, enameled a cheery red, such as children delight to</p>
<p>rock in.</p>
<p>&quot;A queer house,&quot; Mrs. Hale laughed girlishly and contentedly.</p>
<p>&quot;But we love it. Edmund made it with his own hands even to the</p>
<p>plumbing, though he did have a terrible time with that before he</p>
<p>succeeded.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about that hardwood floor downstairs?--an&#x27; the fireplace?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;All, all,&quot; she replied proudly. &quot;And half the furniture. That</p>
<p>cedar desk there, the table--with his own hands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are such gentle hands,&quot; Saxon was moved to say.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale looked at her quickly, her vivid face alive with a</p>
<p>grateful light.</p>
<p>&quot;They are gentle, the gentlest hands I have ever known, &quot; she</p>
<p>said softly. &quot;And you are a dear to have noticed it, for you only</p>
<p>saw them yesterday in passing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn&#x27;t help it,&quot; Saxon said simply.</p>
<p>Her gaze slipped past Mrs. Hale, attracted by the wall beyond,</p>
<p>which was done in a bewitching honeycomb pattern dotted with</p>
<p>golden bees. The walls were hung with a few, a very few, framed</p>
<p>pictures.</p>
<p>&quot;They are all of people,&quot; Saxon said, remembering the beautiful</p>
<p>paintings in Mark Hall&#x27;s bungalow.</p>
<p>&quot;My windows frame my landscape paintings,&quot; Mrs. Hale answered,</p>
<p>pointing out of doors. &quot;Inside I want only the faces of my dear</p>
<p>ones whom I cannot have with me always. Some of them are dreadful</p>
<p>rovers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Saxon was on her feet and looking at a photograph. &quot;You</p>
<p>know Clara Hastings!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I ought to. I did everything but nurse her at my breast. She</p>
<p>came to me when she was a little baby. Her mother was my sister.</p>
<p>Do you know how greatly you resemble her? I remarked it to Edmund</p>
<p>yesterday. He had already seen it. It wasn&#x27;t a bit strange that</p>
<p>his heart leaped out to you two as you came drilling down behind</p>
<p>those beautiful horses.&quot;</p>
<p>So Mrs. Hale was Clara&#x27;s aunt--old stock that had crossed the</p>
<p>Plains. Saxon knew now why she had reminded her so strongly of</p>
<p>her own mother.</p>
<p>The talk whipped quite away from Billy, who could only admire the</p>
<p>detailed work of the cedar desk while he listened. Saxon told of</p>
<p>meeting Clara and Jack Hastings on their yacht and on their</p>
<p>driving trip in Oregon. They were off again, Mrs. Eale said,</p>
<p>having shipped their horses home from Vancouver and taken the</p>
<p>Canadian Pacific on their way to England. Mrs. Hale knew Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>mother or, rather, her poems; and produced, not only &quot;The Story</p>
<p>of the Files,&quot; but a ponderous scrapbook which contained many of</p>
<p>her mother&#x27;s poems which Saxon had never seen. A sweet singer,</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale said; but so many had sung in the days of gold and been</p>
<p>forgotten. There had been no army of magazines then, and the</p>
<p>poems had perished in local newspapers.</p>
<p>Jack Hastings had fallen in love with Clara, the talk ran on;</p>
<p>then, visiting at Trillium Covert, he had fallen in love with</p>
<p>Sonoma Valley and bought a magnificent home ranch, though little</p>
<p>enough he saw of it, being away over the world so much of the</p>
<p>time. Mrs. Hale talked of her own Journey across the Plains, a</p>
<p>little girl, in the late Fifties, and, like Mrs. Mortimer, knew</p>
<p>all about the fight at Little Meadow, and the tale of the</p>
<p>massacre of the emigrant train of which Billy&#x27;s father had been</p>
<p>the sole survivor.</p>
<p>&quot;And so,&quot; Saxon concluded, an hour later, &quot;we&#x27;ve been three years</p>
<p>searching for our valley of the moon, and now we&#x27;ve found it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Valley of the Moon?&quot; Mrs. Hale queried. &quot;Then you knew about it</p>
<p>all the time. What kept you so long?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; we didn&#x27;t know. We just started on a blind search for it.</p>
<p>Mark Hall called it a pilgrimage, and was always teasing us to</p>
<p>carry long staffs. He said when we found the spot we&#x27;d know,</p>
<p>because then the staffs would burst into blossom. He laughed at</p>
<p>all the good things we wanted in our valley, and one night he</p>
<p>took me out and showed me the moon through a telescope. He said</p>
<p>that was the only place we could find such a wonderful valley. He</p>
<p>meant it was moonshine, but we adopted the name and went on</p>
<p>looking for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What a coincidence!&quot; Mrs. Hale exclaimed. &quot;For this is the</p>
<p>Valley of the Moon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know it,&quot; Saxon said with quiet confidence. &quot;It has everything</p>
<p>we wanted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you don&#x27;t understand, my dear. This is the Valley of the</p>
<p>Moon. This is Sonoma Valley. Sonoma is an Indian word, and means</p>
<p>the Valley of the Moon. That was what the Indians called it for</p>
<p>untold ages before the first white men came. We, who love it,</p>
<p>still so call it.&quot;</p>
<p>And then Saxon recalled the mysterious references Jack Hastings</p>
<p>and his wife had made to it, and the talk tripped along until</p>
<p>Billy grew restless. He cleared his throat significantly and</p>
<p>interrupted.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to find out about that ranch acrost the creek--who owns</p>
<p>it, if they&#x27;ll sell, where we&#x27;ll find &#x27;em, an&#x27; such things.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hale stood up.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll go and see Edmund,&quot; she said, catching Saxon by the hand</p>
<p>and leading the way.</p>
<p>&quot;My!&quot; Billy ejaculated, towering above her. &quot;I used to think</p>
<p>Saxon was small. But she&#x27;d make two of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you&#x27;re pretty big,&quot; the little woman smiled; &quot;but Edmund is</p>
<p>taller than you, and broader-shouldered.&quot;</p>
<p>They crossed a bright hall, and found the big beautiful husband</p>
<p>lying back reading in a huge Mission rocker. Beside it was</p>
<p>another tiny child&#x27;s chair of red-enameled rattan. Along the</p>
<p>length of his thigh, the head on his knee and directed toward a</p>
<p>smoldering log in a fireplace, clung an incredibly large striped</p>
<p>cat. Like its master, it turned its head to greet the newcomers.</p>
<p>Again Saxon felt the loving benediction that abided in his face,</p>
<p>his eyes, his hands--toward which she involuntarily dropped her</p>
<p>eyes. Again she was impressed by the gentleness of them. They</p>
<p>were hands of love. They were the hands of a type of man she had</p>
<p>never dreamed existed. No one in that merry crowd of Carmel had</p>
<p>prefigured him. They were artists. This was the scholar, the</p>
<p>philosopher. In place of the passion of youth and all youth&#x27;s mad</p>
<p>revolt, was the benignance of wisdom. Those gentle hands had</p>
<p>passed all the bitter by and plucked only the sweet of life.</p>
<p>Dearly as she loved them, she shuddered to think what some of</p>
<p>those Carmelites would be like when they were as old as</p>
<p>he--especially the dramatic critic and the Iron Man.</p>
<p>&quot;Here are the dear children, Edmund,&quot; Mrs. Hale said. &quot;What do</p>
<p>you think! They want to buy the Madrono Ranch. They&#x27;ve been three</p>
<p>years searching for it--I forgot to tell them we had searched ten</p>
<p>years for Trillium Covert. Tell them all about it. Surely Mr.</p>
<p>Naismith is still of a mind to sell!&quot;</p>
<p>They seated themselves in simple massive chairs, and Mrs. Hale</p>
<p>took the tiny rattan beside the big Mission rocker, her slender</p>
<p>hand curled like a tendril in Edmund&#x27;s. And while Saxon listened</p>
<p>to the talk, her eyes took in the grave rooms lined with books.</p>
<p>She began to realize how a mere structure of wood and stone may</p>
<p>express the spirit of him who conceives and makes it. Those</p>
<p>gentle hands had made all this--the very furniture, she guessed</p>
<p>as her eyes roved from desk to chair, from work table to reading</p>
<p>stand beside the bed in the other room, where stood a</p>
<p>green-shaded lamp and orderly piles of magazines and books.</p>
<p>As for the matter of Madrono Ranch, it was easy enough he was</p>
<p>saying. Naismith would sell. Had desired to sell for the past</p>
<p>five years, ever since he had engaged in the enterprise of</p>
<p>bottling mineral water at the springs lower down the valley. It</p>
<p>was fortunate that he was the owner, for about all the rest of</p>
<p>the surrounding land was owned by a Erenchman--an early settler.</p>
<p>He would not part with a foot of it. He was a peasant, with all</p>
<p>the peasant&#x27;s love of the soil, which, in him, had become an</p>
<p>obsession, a disease. He was a land-miser. With no business</p>
<p>capacity, old and opinionated, he was land poor, and it was an</p>
<p>open question which would arrive first, his death or bankruptcy.</p>
<p>As for Madrono Ranch, Naismith owned it and had set the price at</p>
<p>fifty dollars an acre. That would be one thousand dollars, for</p>
<p>there were twenty acres. As a farming investment, using</p>
<p>old-fashioned methods, it was not worth it. As a business</p>
<p>investment, yes; for the virtues of the valley were on the eve of</p>
<p>being discovered by the outside world, and no better location for</p>
<p>a summer home could be found. As a happiness investment in joy of</p>
<p>beauty and climate, it was worth a thousand times the price</p>
<p>asked. And he knew Naismith would allow time on most of the</p>
<p>amount. Edmund&#x27;s suggestion was that they take a two years&#x27;</p>
<p>lease, with option to buy, the rent to apply to the purchase if</p>
<p>they took it up. Naismith had done that once with a Swiss, who</p>
<p>had paid a monthly rental of ten dollars. But the man&#x27;s wife had</p>
<p>died, and he had gone away.</p>
<p>Edmund soon divined Billy&#x27;s renunciation, though not the nature</p>
<p>of it; and several questions brought it forth-- the old pioneer</p>
<p>dream of land spaciousness; of cattle on a hundred hills; one</p>
<p>hundred and sixty acres of land the smallest thinkable division.</p>
<p>&quot;But you don&#x27;t need all that land, dear lad,&quot; Edmund said softly.</p>
<p>&quot;I see you understand intensive farming. Have you thought about</p>
<p>intensive horse-raising?&quot;</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s jaw dropped at the smashing newness of the idea. He</p>
<p>considered it, but could see no similarity in the two processes.</p>
<p>Unbelief leaped into his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;You gotta show me!&quot; he cried.</p>
<p>The elder man smiled gently.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us see. In the first place, you don&#x27;t need those twenty</p>
<p>acres except for beauty. There are five acres in the meadow. You</p>
<p>don&#x27;t need more than two of them to make your living at selling</p>
<p>vegetables. In fact, you and your wife, working from daylight to</p>
<p>dark, cannot properly farm those two acres. Remains three acres.</p>
<p>You have plenty of water for it from the springs. Don&#x27;t be</p>
<p>satisfied with one crop a year, like the rest of the</p>
<p>old-fashioned farmers in this valley. Farm it like your vegetable</p>
<p>plot, intensively, all the year, in crops that make horse-feed,</p>
<p>irrigating, fertilizing, rotating your crops. Those three acres</p>
<p>will feed as many horses as heaven knows how huge an area of</p>
<p>unseeded, uncared for, wasted pasture would feed. Think it over.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll lend you books on the subject. I don&#x27;t know how large your</p>
<p>crops will be, nor do I know how much a horse eats; that&#x27;s your</p>
<p>business. But I am certain, with a hired man to take your place</p>
<p>helping your wife on her two acres of vegetables, that by the</p>
<p>time you own the horses your three acres will feed, you will have</p>
<p>all you can attend to. Then it will be time to get more land, for</p>
<p>more horses, for more riches, if that way happiness lie.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy understood. In his enthusiasm he dashed out:</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;re some farmer.&quot;</p>
<p>Edmund smiled and glanced toward his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;Give him your opinion of that, Annette.&quot;</p>
<p>Her blue eyes twinkled as she complied.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, the dear, he never farms. He has never farmed. But he</p>
<p>knows.&quot; She waved her hand about the book1ined walls. &quot;He is a</p>
<p>student of good. He studies all good things done by good men</p>
<p>under the sun. His pleasure is in books and wood-working.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t forget Dulcie,&quot; Edmund gently protested.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and Dulcie.&quot; Annette laughed. &quot;Dulcie is our cow. It is a</p>
<p>great question with Jack Hastings whether Edmund dotes more on</p>
<p>Dulcie, or Dulcie dotes more on Edmund. When he goes to San</p>
<p>Francisco Dulcie is miserable. So is Edmund, until he hastens</p>
<p>back. Oh, Dulcie has given me no few jealous pangs. But I have to</p>
<p>confess he understands her as no one else does.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is the one practical subject I know by experience,&quot; Edmund</p>
<p>confirmed. &quot;I am an authority on Jersey cows. Call upon me any</p>
<p>time for counsel.&quot;</p>
<p>He stood up and went toward his book-shelves; and they saw how</p>
<p>magnificently large a man he was. He paused a book in his hand,</p>
<p>to answer a question from Saxon. No; there were no mosquitoes,</p>
<p>although, one summer when the south wind blew for ten days--an</p>
<p>unprecedented thing--a few mosquitoes had been carried up from</p>
<p>San Pablo Bay. As for fog, it was the making of the valley. And</p>
<p>where they were situated, sheltered behind Sonoma Mountain, the</p>
<p>fogs were almost invariably high fogs. Sweeping in from the ocean</p>
<p>forty miles away, they were deflected by Sonoma Mountain and</p>
<p>shunted high into the air. Another thing, Trillium Covert and</p>
<p>Madrono Ranch were happily situated in a narrow thermal belt, so</p>
<p>that in the frosty mornings of winter the temperature was always</p>
<p>several degrees higher than in the rest of the valley. In fact,</p>
<p>frost was very rare in the thermal belt, as was proved by the</p>
<p>successful cultivation of certain orange and lemon trees.</p>
<p>Edmund continued reading titles and selecting books until he had</p>
<p>drawn out quite a number. He opened the top one, Bolton Hall&#x27;s</p>
<p>&quot;Three Acres and Liberty,&quot; and read to them of a man who walked</p>
<p>six hundred and fifty miles a year in cultivating, by</p>
<p>old-fashioned methods, twenty acres, from which he harvested</p>
<p>three thousand bushels of poor potatoes; and of another man, a</p>
<p>&quot;new&quot; farmer, who cultivated only five acres, walked two hundred</p>
<p>miles, and produced three thousand bushels of potatoes, early and</p>
<p>choice, which he sold at many times the price received by the</p>
<p>first man.</p>
<p>Saxon receded the books from Edmund, and, as she heaped them in</p>
<p>Billy&#x27;s arms, read the titles. They were: Wickson&#x27;s &quot;California</p>
<p>Fruits,&quot; Wickson&#x27;s &quot;California Vegetables,&quot; Brooks&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Fertilizers,&quot; Watson&#x27;s &quot;Farm Poultry,&quot; King&#x27;s &quot;Irrigation and</p>
<p>Drainage,&quot; Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;Fields, Factories and Workshops,&quot; and</p>
<p>Farmer&#x27;s Bulletin No. 22 on &quot;The Feeding of Farm Animals.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come for more any time you want them,&quot; Edmund invited. &quot;I have</p>
<p>hundreds of volumes on farming, and all the Agricultural</p>
<p>Bulletins.... And you must come and get acquainted with Dulcie</p>
<p>your first spare time,&quot; he called after them out the door.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer arrived with seed catalogs and farm books, to find</p>
<p>Saxon immersed in the farm books borrowed from Edmund. Saxon</p>
<p>showed her around, and she was delighted with everything,</p>
<p>including the terms of the lease and its option to buy.</p>
<p>&quot;And now,&quot; she said. &quot;What is to be done? Sit down, both of you.</p>
<p>This is a council of war, and I am the one person in the world to</p>
<p>tell you what to do. I ought to be. Anybody who has reorganized</p>
<p>and recatalogued a great city library should be able to start you</p>
<p>young people on in short order. Now, where shall we begin?&quot;</p>
<p>She paused for breath of consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;First, Madrono Ranch is a bargain. I know soil, I know beauty, I</p>
<p>know climate. Madrono Ranch is a gold mine. There is a fortune in</p>
<p>that meadow. Tilth--I&#x27;ll tell you about that later. First, here&#x27;s</p>
<p>the land. Second, what are you going to do with it? Make a</p>
<p>living? Yes. Vegetables? Of course. What are you going to do with</p>
<p>them after you have grown them? Sell. Where?--Now listen. You</p>
<p>must do as I did. Cut out the middle man. Sell directly to the</p>
<p>consumer. Drum up your own market. Do you know what I saw from</p>
<p>the car windows coming up the valley, only several miles from</p>
<p>here? Hotels, springs, summer resorts, winter</p>
<p>resorts--population, mouths, market. How is that market supplied?</p>
<p>I looked in vain for truck gardens.--Billy, harness up your</p>
<p>horses and be ready directly after dinner to take Saxon and me</p>
<p>driving. Never mind everything else. Let things stand. What&#x27;s the</p>
<p>use of starting for a place of which you haven&#x27;t the address.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll look for the address this afternoon. Then we&#x27;ll know where</p>
<p>we are--at.&quot; --The last syllable a smiling concession to Billy.</p>
<p>But Saxon did not accompany them. There was too much to be done</p>
<p>in cleaning the long-abandoned house and in preparing an</p>
<p>arrangement for Mrs. Mortimer to sleep. And it was long after</p>
<p>supper time when Mrs. Mortimer and Billy returned.</p>
<p>&quot;You lucky, lucky children,&quot; she began immediately. &quot;This valley</p>
<p>is just waking up. Here&#x27;s your market. There isn&#x27;t a competitor</p>
<p>in the valley. I thought those resorts looked new--Caliente,</p>
<p>Boyes Hot Springs, E1 Verano, and all along the line. Then there</p>
<p>are three little hotels in Glen Ellen, right next door. Oh, I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>talked with all the owners and managers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s a wooz,&quot; Billy admired. &quot;She&#x27;d brace up to God on a</p>
<p>business proposition. You oughta seen her.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer acknowledged the compliment and dashed on.</p>
<p>&quot;And where do all the vegetables come from? Wagons drive down</p>
<p>twelve to fifteen miles from Santa Rosa, and up from Sonoma.</p>
<p>Those are the nearest truck farms, and when they fail, as they</p>
<p>often do, I am told, to supply the increasing needs, the managers</p>
<p>have to express vegetables all the way from San Francisco. I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>introduced Billy. They&#x27;ve agreed to patronize home industry.</p>
<p>Besides, it is better for them. You&#x27;ll deliver just as good</p>
<p>vegetables just as cheap; you will make it a point to deliver</p>
<p>better, fresher vegetables; and don&#x27;t forget that delivery for</p>
<p>you will be cheaper by virtue of the shorter haul.</p>
<p>&quot;No day-old egg stunt here. No jams nor jellies. But you&#x27;ve got</p>
<p>lots of space up on the bench here on which you can&#x27;t grow</p>
<p>vegetables. To-morrow morning I&#x27;ll help you lay out the chicken</p>
<p>runs and houses. Besides, there is the matter of capons for the</p>
<p>San Francisco market. You&#x27;ll start small. It will be a side line</p>
<p>at first. I&#x27;ll tell you all about that, too, and send you the</p>
<p>literature. You must use your head. Let others do the work. You</p>
<p>must understand that thoroughly. The wages of superintendence are</p>
<p>always larger than the wages of the laborers. You must keep</p>
<p>books. You must know where you stand. You must know what pays and</p>
<p>what doesn&#x27;t and what pays best. Your books will tell that. I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>show you all in good time. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; think of it--all that on two acres!&quot; Billy murmured.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer looked at him sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;Two acres your granny,&quot; she said with asperity. &quot;Five acres. And</p>
<p>then you won&#x27;t be able to supply your market. And you, my boy, as</p>
<p>soon as the first rains come will have your hands full and your</p>
<p>horses weary draining that meadow. We&#x27;ll work those plans out</p>
<p>to-morrow Also, there is the matter of berries on the bench</p>
<p>here--and trellised table grapes, the choicest. They bring the</p>
<p>fancy prices. There will be blackberries--Burbank&#x27;s, he lives at</p>
<p>Santa Rosa--Loganberries, Mammoth berries. But don&#x27;t fool with</p>
<p>strawberries. That&#x27;s a whole occupation in itself. They&#x27;re not</p>
<p>vines, you know. I&#x27;ve examined the orchard. It&#x27;s a good</p>
<p>foundation. We&#x27;ll settle the pruning and grafts later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Billy wanted three acres of the meadow,&quot; Saxon explained at</p>
<p>the first chance.</p>
<p>&quot;What for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To grow hay and other kinds of food for the horses he&#x27;s going to</p>
<p>raise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Buy it out of a portion of the profits from those three acres,&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mortimer decided on the instant.</p>
<p>Billy swallowed, and again achieved renunciation.</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; he said, with a brave show of cheerfulness. &quot;Let her</p>
<p>go. Us for the greens.&quot;</p>
<p>During the several days of Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s visit, Billy let the</p>
<p>two women settle things for themselves. Oakland had entered upon</p>
<p>a boom, and from the West Oakland stables had come an urgent</p>
<p>letter for more horses. So Billy was out, early and late,</p>
<p>scouring the surrounding country for young work animals. In this</p>
<p>way, at the start, he learned his valley thoroughly. There was</p>
<p>also a clearing out at the West Oakland stables of mares whose</p>
<p>feet had been knocked out on the hard city pave meets, and he was</p>
<p>offered first choice at bargain prices. They were good animals.</p>
<p>He knew what they were because he knew them of old time. The soft</p>
<p>earth of the country, with a preliminary rest in pasture with</p>
<p>their shoes pulled off, would put them in shape. They would never</p>
<p>do again on hard-paved streets, but there were years of farm work</p>
<p>in them. And then there was the breeding. But he could not</p>
<p>undertake to buy them. He fought out the battle in secret and</p>
<p>said nothing to Saxon.</p>
<p>At night, he would sit in the kitchen and smoke, listening to all</p>
<p>that the two women had done and planned in the day. The right</p>
<p>kind of horses was hard to buy, and, as he put it, it was like</p>
<p>pulling a tooth to get a farmer to part with one, despite the</p>
<p>fact that he had been authorized to increase the buying sum by as</p>
<p>much as fifty dollars. Despite the coming of the automobile, the</p>
<p>price of heavy draught animals continued to rise. From as early</p>
<p>as Billy could remember, the price of the big work horses had</p>
<p>increased steadily. After the great earthquake, the price had</p>
<p>jumped; yet it had never gone back.</p>
<p>&quot;Billy, you make more money as a horse-buyer than a common</p>
<p>laborer, don&#x27;t you?&quot; Mrs. Mortimer asked. &quot;Very well, then. You</p>
<p>won&#x27;t have to drain the meadow, or plow it, or anything. You keep</p>
<p>right on buying horses. Work with your head. But out of what you</p>
<p>make you will please pay the wages of one laborer for Saxon&#x27;s</p>
<p>vegetables. It will be a good investment, with quick returns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; he agreed. &quot;That&#x27;s all anybody hires any body for--to</p>
<p>make money outa &#x27;m. But how Saxon an&#x27; one man are goin&#x27; to work</p>
<p>them five acres, when Mr. Hale says two of us couldn&#x27;t do what&#x27;s</p>
<p>needed on two acres, is beyond me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Saxon isn&#x27;t going to work,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer retorted.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you see me working at San Jose? Saxon is going to use her</p>
<p>head. It&#x27;s about time you woke up to that. A dollar and a half a</p>
<p>day is what is earned by persons who don&#x27;t use their heads. And</p>
<p>she isn&#x27;t going to be satisfied with a dollar and a half a day.</p>
<p>Now listen. I had a long talk with Mr. Hale this afternoon. He</p>
<p>says there are practically no efficient laborers to be hired in</p>
<p>the valley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know that,&quot; Billy interjected. &quot;All the good men go to the</p>
<p>cities. It&#x27;s only the leavin&#x27;s that&#x27;s left. The good ones that</p>
<p>stay behind ain&#x27;t workin&#x27; for wages.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which is perfectly true, every word. Now listen, children. I</p>
<p>knew about it, and I spoke to Mr. Hale. He is prepared to make</p>
<p>the arrangements for you. He knows all about it himself, and is</p>
<p>in touch with the Warden. In short, you will parole two</p>
<p>good-conduct prisoners from San Quentin; and they will be</p>
<p>gardeners. There are plenty of Chinese and Italians there, and</p>
<p>they are the best truck-farmers. You kill two birds with one</p>
<p>stone. You serve the poor convicts, and you serve yourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon hesitated, shocked; while Billy gravely considered the</p>
<p>question.</p>
<p>&quot;You know John,&quot; Mrs. Mortimer went on, &quot;Mr. Hale&#x27;s man about the</p>
<p>place? How do you like him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I was wishing only to-day that we could find somebody like</p>
<p>him,&quot; Saxon said eagerly. &quot;He&#x27;s such a dear, faithful soul. Mrs.</p>
<p>Hale told me a lot of fine things about him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s one thing she didn&#x27;t tell you,&quot; smiled Mrs. Mortimer.</p>
<p>&quot;John is a paroled convict. Twenty-eight years ago, in hot blood,</p>
<p>he killed a man in a quarrel over sixty-five cents. He&#x27;s been out</p>
<p>of prison with the Hales three years now. You remember Louis, the</p>
<p>old Frenchman, on my place? He&#x27;s another. So that&#x27;s settled. When</p>
<p>your two come--of course you will pay them fair wages--and we&#x27;ll</p>
<p>make sure they&#x27;re the same nationality, either Chinese or</p>
<p>Italians--well, when they come, John, with their help, and under</p>
<p>Mr. Hale&#x27;s guidance, will knock together a small cabin for them</p>
<p>to live in. We&#x27;ll select the spot. Even so, when your farm is in</p>
<p>full swing you&#x27;ll have to have more outside help. So keep your</p>
<p>eyes open, Billy, while you&#x27;re gallivanting over the valley.&quot;</p>
<p>The next night Billy failed to return, and at nine o&#x27;clock a Glen</p>
<p>Ellen boy on horseback delivered a telegram. Billy had sent it</p>
<p>from Lake County. He was after horses for Oakland.</p>
<p>Not until the third night did he arrive home, tired to</p>
<p>exhaustion, but with an ill concealed air of pride.</p>
<p>&quot;Now what have you been doing these three days?&quot; Mrs. Mortimer</p>
<p>demanded.</p>
<p>&quot;Usin&#x27; my head,&quot; he boasted quietly. &quot;Killin&#x27; two birds with one</p>
<p>stone; an&#x27;, take it from me, I killed a whole flock. Huh! I got</p>
<p>word of it at Lawndale, an&#x27; I wanta tell you Hazel an&#x27; Hattie was</p>
<p>some tired when I stabled &#x27;m at Calistoga an&#x27; pulled out on the</p>
<p>stage over St. Helena. I was Johnny-on-the-spot, an&#x27; I nailed</p>
<p>&#x27;m-- eight whoppers--the whole outfit of a mountain teamster.</p>
<p>Young animals, sound as a-dollar, and the lightest of &#x27;em over</p>
<p>fifteen hundred. I shipped &#x27;m last night from Calistoga. An&#x27;,</p>
<p>well, that ain&#x27;t all.</p>
<p>&quot;Before that, first day, at Lawndale, I seen the fellow with the</p>
<p>teamin&#x27; contract for the pavin&#x27;-stone quarry. Sell horses! He</p>
<p>wanted to buy &#x27;em. He wanted to buy &#x27;em bad. He&#x27;d even rent &#x27;em,</p>
<p>he said.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you sent him the eight you bought!&quot; Saxon broke in.</p>
<p>&quot;Guess again. I bought them eight with Oakland money, an&#x27; they</p>
<p>was shipped to Oakland. But I got the Lawndale contractor on long</p>
<p>distance, and he agreed to pay me half a dollar a day rent for</p>
<p>every work horse up to half a dozen. Then I telegraphed the Boss,</p>
<p>tellin&#x27; him to ship me six sore-footed mares, Bud Strothers to</p>
<p>make the choice, an&#x27; to charge to my commission. Bud knows what I</p>
<p>&#x27;m after. Soon as they come, off go their shoes. Two weeks in</p>
<p>pasture, an&#x27; then they go to Lawndale. They can do the work. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>a down-hill haul to the railroad on a dirt road. Half a dollar</p>
<p>rent each--that&#x27;s three dollars a day they&#x27;ll bring me six days a</p>
<p>week. I don&#x27;t feed &#x27;em, shoe &#x27;m, or nothin&#x27;, an&#x27; I keep an eye on</p>
<p>&#x27;m to see they&#x27;re treated right. Three bucks a day, eh! Well, I</p>
<p>guess that&#x27;ll keep a couple of dollar-an &#x27;-a-half men goin&#x27; for</p>
<p>Saxon, unless she works &#x27;em Sundays. Huh! The Valley of the Moon!</p>
<p>Why, we&#x27;ll be wearin&#x27; diamonds before long. Gosh! A fellow could</p>
<p>live in the city a thousan&#x27; years an&#x27; not get such chances. It</p>
<p>beats China lottery.&quot;</p>
<p>He stood up.</p>
<p>&quot;I &#x27;m goin&#x27; out to water Hazel an&#x27; Hattie, feed &#x27;m, an&#x27; bed &#x27;m</p>
<p>down. I&#x27;ll eat soon as I come back.&quot;</p>
<p>The two women were regarding each other with shining eyes, each</p>
<p>on the verge of speech when Billy returned to the door and stuck</p>
<p>his head in.</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;s one thing maybe you ain&#x27;t got,&quot; he said. &quot;I pull down</p>
<p>them three dollars every day; but the six mares is mine, too. I</p>
<p>own &#x27;m. They&#x27;re mine. Are you on?&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XX</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not done with you children,&quot; had been Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s</p>
<p>parting words; and several times that winter she ran up to</p>
<p>advise, and to teach Saxon how to calculate her crops for the</p>
<p>small immediate market, for the increasing spring market, and for</p>
<p>the height of summer, at which time she would be able to sell all</p>
<p>she could possibly grow and then not supply the demand. In the</p>
<p>meantime, Hazel and Hattie were used every odd moment in hauling</p>
<p>manure from Glen Ellen, whose barnyards had never known such a</p>
<p>thorough cleaning. Also there were loads of commercial fertilizer</p>
<p>from the railroad station, bought under Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s</p>
<p>instructions.</p>
<p>The convicts paroled were Chinese. Both had served long in</p>
<p>prison, and were old men; but the day&#x27;s work they were habitually</p>
<p>capable of won Mrs. Mortimer&#x27;s approval. Gow Yum, twenty years</p>
<p>before, had had charge of the vegetable garden of one of the</p>
<p>great Menlo Park estates. His disaster had come in the form of a</p>
<p>fight over a game of fan tan in the Chinese quarter at Redwood</p>
<p>City. His companion, Chan Chi, had been a hatchet-man of note, in</p>
<p>the old fighting days of the San Franciseo tongs. But a quarter</p>
<p>of century of discipline in the prison vegetable gardens had</p>
<p>cooled his blood and turned his hand from hatchet to hoe. These</p>
<p>two assistants had arrived in Glen Ellen like precious goods in</p>
<p>bond and been receipted for by the local deputy sheriff, who, in</p>
<p>addition, reported on them to the prison authorities each month.</p>
<p>Saxon, too, made out a monthly report and sent it in.</p>
<p>As for the danger of their cutting her throat, she quickly got</p>
<p>over the idea of it. The mailed hand of the State hovered over</p>
<p>them. The taking of a single drink of liquor would provoke that</p>
<p>hand to close down and jerk them back to prison-cells. Nor had</p>
<p>they freedom of movement. When old Gow Yum needed to go to San</p>
<p>Francisco to sign certain papers before the Chinese Consul,</p>
<p>permission had first to be obtained from San Quentin. Then, too,</p>
<p>neither man was nasty tempered. Saxon had been apprehensive of</p>
<p>the task of bossing two desperate convicts; but when they came</p>
<p>she found it a pleasure to work with them. She could tell them</p>
<p>what to do, but it was they who knew how do. Prom them she</p>
<p>learned all the ten thousand tricks and quirks of artful</p>
<p>gardening, and she was not long in realizing how helpless she</p>
<p>would have been had she depended on local labor.</p>
<p>Still further, she had no fear, because she was not alone. She</p>
<p>had been using her head. It was quickly apparent to her that she</p>
<p>could not adequately oversee the outside work and at the same</p>
<p>time do the house work. She wrote to Ukiah to the energetic widow</p>
<p>who had lived in the adjoining house and taken in washing. She</p>
<p>had promptly closed with Saxon&#x27;s offer. Mrs. Paul was forty,</p>
<p>short in stature, and weighed two hundred pounds, but never</p>
<p>wearied on her feet. Also she was devoid of fear, and, according</p>
<p>to Billy, could settle the hash of both Chinese with one of her</p>
<p>mighty arms. Mrs. Paul arrived with her son, a country lad of</p>
<p>sixteen who knew horses and could milk Hilda, the pretty Jersey</p>
<p>which had successfully passed Edmund&#x27;s expert eye. Though Mrs.</p>
<p>Paul ably handled the house, there was one thing Saxon insisted</p>
<p>on doing--namely, washing her own pretty flimsies.</p>
<p>&quot;When I &#x27;m no longer able to do that,&quot; she told Billy, &quot;you can</p>
<p>take a spade to that clump of redwoods beside Wild Water and dig</p>
<p>a hole. It will be time to bury me.&quot;</p>
<p>It was early in the days of Madrono Ranch, at the time of Mrs.</p>
<p>Mortimer&#x27;s second visit, that Billy drove in with a load of pipe;</p>
<p>and house, chicken yards, and barn were piped from the</p>
<p>second-hand tank he installed below the house-spring.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh ! I guess I can use my head,&quot; he said. &quot;I watched a woman</p>
<p>over on the other side of the valley, packin&#x27; water two hundred</p>
<p>feet from the spring to the house; an&#x27; I did some figurin&#x27;. I put</p>
<p>it at three trips a day and on wash days a whole lot more; an&#x27;</p>
<p>you can&#x27;t guess what I made out she traveled a year packin&#x27;</p>
<p>water. One hundred an&#x27; twenty-two miles. D&#x27;ye get that? One</p>
<p>hundred and twenty-two miles! I asked her how long she&#x27;d been</p>
<p>there. Thirty-one years. Multiply it for yourself. Three</p>
<p>thousan&#x27;, seven hundred an&#x27; eighty-two miles--all for the sake of</p>
<p>two hundred feet of pipe. Wouldn&#x27;t that jar you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I ain&#x27;t done yet. They&#x27;s a bath-tub an&#x27; stationary tubs</p>
<p>a-comin&#x27; soon as I can see my way. An&#x27;, say, Saxon, you know that</p>
<p>little clear flat just where Wild Water runs into Sonoma. They&#x27;s</p>
<p>all of an acre of it. An&#x27; it&#x27;s mine! Got that? An&#x27; no walkin&#x27; on</p>
<p>the grass for you. It&#x27;ll be my grass. I &#x27;m goin&#x27; up stream a ways</p>
<p>an&#x27; put in a ram. I got a big second-hand one staked out that I</p>
<p>can get for ten dollars, an&#x27; it&#x27;ll pump more water&#x27;n I need. An&#x27;</p>
<p>you&#x27;ll see alfalfa growin&#x27; that&#x27;ll make your mouth water. I gotta</p>
<p>have another horse to travel around on. You&#x27;re usin&#x27; Hazel an&#x27;</p>
<p>Hattie too much to give me a chance; an&#x27; I&#x27;ll never see &#x27;m as</p>
<p>soon as you start deliverin&#x27; vegetables. I guess that alfalfa&#x27;ll</p>
<p>help some to keep another horse goin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>But Billy was destined for a time to forget his alfalfa in the</p>
<p>excitement of bigger ventures. First, came trouble. The several</p>
<p>hundred dollars he had arrived with in Sonoma Valley, and all his</p>
<p>own commissions since earned, had gone into improvements and</p>
<p>living. The eighteen dollars a week rental for his six horses at</p>
<p>Lawndale went to pay wages. And he was unable to buy the needed</p>
<p>saddle-horse for his horse-buying expeditions. This, however, he</p>
<p>had got around by again using his head and killing two birds with</p>
<p>one stone. He began breaking colts to drive, and in the driving</p>
<p>drove them wherever he sought horses.</p>
<p>So far all was well. But a new administration in San Francisco,</p>
<p>pledged to economy, had stopped all street work. This meant the</p>
<p>shutting down of the Lawndale quarry, which was one of the</p>
<p>sources of supply for paving blocks. The six horses would not</p>
<p>only be back on his hands, but he would have to feed them. How</p>
<p>Mrs. Paul, Gow Yum, and Chan Chi were to be paid was beyond him.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess we&#x27;ve bit off more&#x27;n we could chew,&quot; he admitted to</p>
<p>Saxon.</p>
<p>That night he was late in coming home, but brought with him a</p>
<p>radiant face. Saxon was no less radiant.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right,&quot; she greeted him, coming out to the barn where</p>
<p>he was unhitching a tired but fractious colt. &quot;I&#x27;ve talked with</p>
<p>all three. They see the situation, and are perfectly willing to</p>
<p>let their wages stand a while. By another week I start Hazel and</p>
<p>Hattie delivering vegetables. Then the money will pour in from</p>
<p>the hotels and my books won&#x27;t look so lopsided. And--oh,</p>
<p>Billy--you&#x27;d never guess. Old Gow Yum has a bank account. He came</p>
<p>to me afterward--I guess he was thinking it over-- and offered to</p>
<p>lend me four hundred dollars. What do you think of that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I ain&#x27;t goin&#x27; to be too proud to borrow it off &#x27;m, if he IS</p>
<p>a Chink. He&#x27;s a white one, an&#x27; maybe I&#x27;ll need it. Because, you</p>
<p>see--well, you can&#x27;t guess what I&#x27;ve been up to since I seen you</p>
<p>this mornin&#x27;. I&#x27;ve been so busy I ain&#x27;t had a bite to eat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Using your head?&quot; She laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;You can call it that,&quot; he joined in her laughter. &quot;I&#x27;ve been</p>
<p>spendin&#x27; money like water.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you haven&#x27;t got any to spend,&quot; she objected.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve got credit in this valley, I&#x27;ll let you know,&quot; he replied.</p>
<p>&quot; An&#x27; I sure strained it some this afternoon. Now guess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A saddle-horse?&quot;</p>
<p>He roared with laughter, startling the colt, which tried to bolt</p>
<p>and lifted him half off the ground by his grip on its frightened</p>
<p>nose and neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I mean real guessin&#x27;,&quot; he urged, when the animal had dropped</p>
<p>back to earth and stood regarding him with trembling suspicion.</p>
<p>&quot;Two saddle-horses?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, you ain&#x27;t got imagination. I&#x27;ll tell you. You know</p>
<p>Thiercroft. I bought his big wagon from &#x27;m for sixty dollars. I</p>
<p>bought a wagon from the Kenwood blacksmith-- so-so, but it&#x27;ll</p>
<p>do--for forty-five dollars. An&#x27; I bought Ping&#x27;s wagon--a</p>
<p>peach--for sixty-five dollars. I could a-got it for fifty if he</p>
<p>hadn&#x27;t seen I wanted it bad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the money?&quot; Saxon questioned faintly. &quot;You hadn&#x27;t a hundred</p>
<p>dollars left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn&#x27;t I tell you I had credit? Well, I have. I stood &#x27;m off for</p>
<p>them wagons. I ain&#x27;t spent a cent of cash money to-day except for</p>
<p>a couple of long-distance switches. Then I bought three sets of</p>
<p>work-harness--they&#x27;re chain harness an&#x27; second-hand--for twenty</p>
<p>dollars a set. I bought &#x27;m from the fellow that&#x27;s doin&#x27; the</p>
<p>haulin&#x27; for the quarry. He don&#x27;t need &#x27;m any more. An&#x27; I rented</p>
<p>four wagons from &#x27;m, an&#x27; four span of horses, too, at half a</p>
<p>dollar a day for each horse, an&#x27; half a dollar a day for each</p>
<p>wagon--that&#x27;s six dollars a day rent I gotta pay &#x27;m. The three</p>
<p>sets of spare harness is for my six horses. Then . . .lemme see .</p>
<p>. . yep, I rented two barns in Glen Ellen, an&#x27; I ordered fifty</p>
<p>tons of hay an&#x27; a carload of bran an&#x27; barley from the store in</p>
<p>Glenwood-- you see, I gotta feed all them fourteen horses, an&#x27;</p>
<p>shoe &#x27;m, an&#x27; everything.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sure Pete, I&#x27;ve went some. I hired seven men to go drivin&#x27;</p>
<p>for me at two dollars a day, an&#x27;--ouch! Jehosaphat! What you</p>
<p>doin&#x27;!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Saxon said gravely, having pinched him, &quot;you&#x27;re not</p>
<p>dreaming.&quot; She felt his pulse and forehead. &quot;Not a sign of</p>
<p>fever.&quot; She sniffed his breath. &quot;And you&#x27;ve not been drinking. Go</p>
<p>on, tell me the rest of this...whatever it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t you satisfied?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. I want more. I want all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right. But I just want you to know, first, that the boss I</p>
<p>used to work for in Oakland ain&#x27;t got nothin&#x27; on me. I &#x27;m some</p>
<p>man of affairs, if anybody should ride up on a vegetable wagon</p>
<p>an&#x27; ask you. Now, I &#x27;m goin&#x27; to tell you, though I can&#x27;t see why</p>
<p>the Glen Ellen folks didn&#x27;t beat me to it. I guess they was</p>
<p>asleep. Nobody&#x27;d a-overlooked a thing like it in the city. You</p>
<p>see, it was like this: you know that fancy brickyard they&#x27;re</p>
<p>gettin&#x27; ready to start for makin&#x27; extra special fire brick for</p>
<p>inside walls? Well, here was I worryin&#x27; about the six horses</p>
<p>comin&#x27; back on my hands, earnin&#x27; me nothin&#x27; an&#x27; eatin&#x27; me into</p>
<p>the poorhouse. I had to get &#x27;m work somehow, an&#x27; I remembered the</p>
<p>brickyard. I drove the colt down an&#x27; talked with that Jap chemist</p>
<p>who&#x27;s been doin&#x27; the experimentin&#x27;. Gee! They was foremen lookin&#x27;</p>
<p>over the ground an&#x27; everything gettin&#x27; ready to hum. I looked</p>
<p>over the lay an&#x27; studied it. Then I drove up to where they&#x27;re</p>
<p>openin&#x27; the clay pit--you know, that fine, white chalky stuff we</p>
<p>saw &#x27;em borin&#x27; out just outside the hundred an&#x27; forty acres with</p>
<p>the three knolls. It&#x27;s a down-hill haul, a mile, an&#x27; two horses</p>
<p>can do it easy. In fact, their hardest job&#x27;ll be haulin&#x27; the</p>
<p>empty wagons up to the pit. Then I tied the colt an&#x27; went to</p>
<p>figurin&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;The Jap professor&#x27;d told me the manager an&#x27; the other big guns</p>
<p>of the company was comin&#x27; up on the mornin&#x27; train. I wasn&#x27;t</p>
<p>shoutin&#x27; things out to anybody, but I just made myself into a</p>
<p>committee of welcome; an&#x27;, when the train pulled in, there I was,</p>
<p>extendin&#x27; the glad hand of the burg--likewise the glad hand of a</p>
<p>guy you used to know in Oakland once, a third-rate dub</p>
<p>prizefighter by the name of--lemme see--yep, I got it right--Big</p>
<p>Bill Roberts was the name he used to sport, but now he&#x27;s known as</p>
<p>William Roberts, E. S. Q.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, as I was sayin&#x27;, I gave &#x27;m the glad hand, an&#x27; trailed</p>
<p>along with &#x27;em to the brickyard, an&#x27; from the talk I could see</p>
<p>things was doin&#x27;. Then I watched my chance an&#x27; sprung my</p>
<p>proposition. I was scared stiff all the time for maybe the</p>
<p>teamin&#x27; was already arranged. But I knew it wasn&#x27;t when they</p>
<p>asked for my figures. I had &#x27;m by heart, an&#x27; I rattled &#x27;m off,</p>
<p>and the top-guy took &#x27;m down in his note-book.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;We&#x27;re goin&#x27; into this big, an&#x27; at once,&#x27; he says, lookin&#x27; at me</p>
<p>sharp. &#x27;What kind of an outfit you got, Mr. Roberts?&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me!--with only Hazel an&#x27; Hattie, an&#x27; them too small for heavy</p>
<p>teamin&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I can slap fourteen horses an&#x27; seven wagons onto the job at the</p>
<p>jump,&#x27; says I. &#x27;An&#x27; if you want more, I&#x27;ll get &#x27;m, that&#x27;s all.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Give us fifteen minutes to consider, Mr. Roberts,&#x27; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Sure,&#x27; says I, important as all hell--ahem--me!--&#x27;but a couple</p>
<p>of other things first. I want a two year contract, an&#x27; them</p>
<p>figures all depends on one thing. Otherwise they don&#x27;t go.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;What&#x27;s that,&#x27; he says.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;The dump,&#x27; says I. &#x27;Here we are on the ground, an&#x27; I might as</p>
<p>well show you.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I did. I showed &#x27;m where I&#x27;d lose out if they stuck to their</p>
<p>plan, on account of the dip down an&#x27; pull up to the dump. &#x27;All</p>
<p>you gotta do,&#x27; I says, &#x27;is to build the bunkers fifty feet over,</p>
<p>throw the road around the rim of the hill, an&#x27; make about seventy</p>
<p>or eighty feet of elevated bridge.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon, that kind of talk got &#x27;em. It was straight. Only</p>
<p>they&#x27;d been thinkin&#x27; about bricks, while I was only thinkin&#x27; of</p>
<p>teamin&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess they was all of half an hour considerin&#x27;, an&#x27; I was</p>
<p>almost as miserable waitin&#x27; as when I waited for you to say yes</p>
<p>after I asked you. I went over the figures, calculatin&#x27; what I</p>
<p>could throw off if I had to. You see, I&#x27;d given it to &#x27;em</p>
<p>stiff--regular city prices; an&#x27; I was prepared to trim down. Then</p>
<p>they come back.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Prices oughta be lower in the country,&#x27; says the top-guy.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Nope,&#x27; I says. &#x27;This is a wine-grape valley. It don&#x27;t raise</p>
<p>enough hay an&#x27; feed for its own animals. It has to be shipped in</p>
<p>from the San Joaquin Valley. Why, I can buy hay an&#x27; feed cheaper</p>
<p>in San Francisco, laid down, than I can here an&#x27; haul it myself.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; that struck &#x27;m hard. It was true, an&#x27; they knew it.</p>
<p>But--say! If they&#x27;d asked about wages for drivers, an&#x27; about</p>
<p>horse-shoein&#x27; prices, I&#x27;d a-had to come down; because, you see,</p>
<p>they ain&#x27;t no teamsters&#x27; union in the country, an&#x27; no</p>
<p>horseshoers&#x27; union, an&#x27; rent is low, an&#x27; them two items come a</p>
<p>whole lot cheaper. Huh! This afternoon I got a word bargain with</p>
<p>the blacksmith across from the post office; an&#x27; he takes my whole</p>
<p>bunch an&#x27; throws off twenty-five cents on each shoein&#x27;, though</p>
<p>it&#x27;s on the Q. T. But they didn&#x27;t think to ask, bein&#x27; too full of</p>
<p>bricks.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy felt in his breast pocket, drew out a legal-looking</p>
<p>document, and handed it to Saxon.</p>
<p>&quot;There it is,&quot; he said, &quot;the contract, full of all the</p>
<p>agreements, prices, an&#x27; penalties. I saw Mr. Hale down town an&#x27;</p>
<p>showed it to &#x27;m. He says it&#x27;s O.K. An&#x27; say, then I lit out. All</p>
<p>over town, Kenwood, I`awndale, everywhere, everybody, everything.</p>
<p>The quarry teamin&#x27; finishes Friday of this week. An&#x27; I take the</p>
<p>whole outfit an&#x27; start Wednesday of next week haulin&#x27; lumber for</p>
<p>the buildin&#x27;s, an&#x27; bricks for the kilns, an&#x27; all the rest. An&#x27;</p>
<p>when they&#x27;re ready for the clay I &#x27;m the boy that&#x27;ll give it to</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>&quot;But I ain&#x27;t told you the best yet. I couldn&#x27;t get the switch</p>
<p>right away from Kenwood to Lawndale, and while I waited I went</p>
<p>over my figures again. You couldn&#x27;t guess it in a million years.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d made a mistake in addition somewhere, an&#x27; soaked &#x27;m ten per</p>
<p>cent. more&#x27;n I&#x27;d expected. Talk about findin&#x27; money! Any time you</p>
<p>want them couple of extra men to help out with the vegetables,</p>
<p>say the word. Though we&#x27;re goin&#x27; to have to pinch the next couple</p>
<p>of months. An&#x27; go ahead an&#x27; borrow that four hundred from Gow</p>
<p>Yum. An&#x27; tell him you&#x27;ll pay eight per cent. interest, an&#x27; that</p>
<p>we won&#x27;t want it more &#x27;n three or four months.&quot;</p>
<p>When Billy got away from Saxon&#x27;s arms, he started leading the</p>
<p>colt up and down to cool it off. He stopped so sbruptly that his</p>
<p>back collided with the colt&#x27;s nose, and there was a lively minute</p>
<p>of rearing and plunging. Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea</p>
<p>had struck Billy.</p>
<p>&quot;Say,&quot; he said, &quot;do you know anything about bank accounts and</p>
<p>drawin&#x27; checks?&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXI</p>
<p>It was on a bright June morning that Billy told Saxon to put on</p>
<p>her riding clothes to try out a saddle-horse.</p>
<p>&quot;Not until after ten o&#x27;clock,&quot; she said &quot;By that time I&#x27;ll have</p>
<p>the wagon off on a second trip.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite the extent of the business she had developed, her</p>
<p>executive ability and system gave her much spare time. She could</p>
<p>call on the Hales, which was ever a delight, especially now that</p>
<p>the Hastings were back and that Clara was often at her aunt&#x27;s. In</p>
<p>this congenial atmosphere Saxon Burgeoned. She had begun to read-</p>
<p>-to read with understanding; and she had time for her books, for</p>
<p>work on her pretties, and for Billy, whom she accompanied on many</p>
<p>expeditions.</p>
<p>Billy was even busier than she, his work being more scattered and</p>
<p>diverse. And, as well, he kept his eye on the home barn and</p>
<p>horses which Saxon used. In truth he had become a man of affairs,</p>
<p>though Mrs. Mortimer had gone over his accounts, with an eagle</p>
<p>eye on the expense column, discovering several minor leaks, and</p>
<p>finally, aided by Saxon, bullied him into keeping books. Each</p>
<p>night, after supper, he and Saxon posted their books. Afterward,</p>
<p>in the big morris chair he had insisted on buying early in the</p>
<p>days of his brickyard contract, Saxon would creep into his arms</p>
<p>and strum on the ukelele; or they would talk long about what they</p>
<p>were doing and planning to do. Now it would be:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m mixin&#x27; up in politics, Saxon. It pays. You bet it pays. If</p>
<p>by next spring I ain&#x27;t got a half a dozen teams workin&#x27; on the</p>
<p>roads an&#x27; pullin&#x27; down the county money, it&#x27;s me back to Oakland</p>
<p>an&#x27; askin&#x27; the Boss for a job.&quot;</p>
<p>Or, Saxon: &quot;They&#x27;re really starting that new hotel between</p>
<p>Caliente and Eldridge. And there&#x27;s some talk of a big sanitarium</p>
<p>back in the hills.&quot;</p>
<p>Or, it would be: &quot;Billy, now that you&#x27;ve piped that acre, you&#x27;ve</p>
<p>just got to let me have it for my vegetables. I&#x27;ll rent it from</p>
<p>you. I&#x27;ll take your own estimate for all the alfalfa you can</p>
<p>raise on it, and pay you full market price less the cost of</p>
<p>growing it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right, take it.&quot; Billy suppressed a sigh. &quot;Besides, I</p>
<p>&#x27;m too busy to fool with it now. &quot;</p>
<p>Which prevarication was bare-faced, by virtue of his having just</p>
<p>installed the ram and piped the land.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be the wisest, Billy,&quot; she soothed, for she knew his</p>
<p>dream of land-spaciousness was stronger than ever. &quot;You don&#x27;t</p>
<p>want to fool with an acre. There&#x27;s that hundred and forty. We&#x27;ll</p>
<p>buy it yet if old Chavon ever dies. Besides, it really belongs to</p>
<p>Madrono Ranch. The two together were the original quarter</p>
<p>section.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t wish no man&#x27;s death,&quot; Billy grumbled. &quot;But he ain&#x27;t</p>
<p>gettin&#x27; no good out of it, over-pasturin&#x27; it with a lot of scrub</p>
<p>animals. I&#x27;ve sized it up every inch of it. They&#x27;s at least forty</p>
<p>acres in the three cleared fields, with water in the hills behind</p>
<p>to beat the band. The horse feed I could raise on it&#x27;d take your</p>
<p>breath away. Then they&#x27;s at least fifty acres I could run my</p>
<p>brood mares on, pasture mixed up with trees and steep places and</p>
<p>such. The other fifty&#x27;s just thick woods, an&#x27; pretty places, an&#x27;</p>
<p>wild game. An&#x27; that old adobe barn&#x27;s all right. With a new roof</p>
<p>it&#x27;d shelter any amount of animals in bad weather. Cook at me</p>
<p>now, rentin&#x27; that measly pasture back of Ping&#x27;s just to run my</p>
<p>restin&#x27; animals. They could run in the hundred an&#x27; forty if I</p>
<p>only had it. I wonder if Chavon would lease it.&quot;</p>
<p>Or, less ambitious, Billy would say: &quot;I gotta skin over to</p>
<p>Petaluma to-morrow, Saxon. They&#x27;s an auction on the Atkinson</p>
<p>Ranch an&#x27; maybe I can pick up some bargains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More horses!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t I got two teams haulin&#x27; lumber for the new winery? An&#x27;</p>
<p>Barney&#x27;s got a bad shoulder-sprain. He&#x27;ll have to lay off a long</p>
<p>time if he&#x27;s to get it in shape. An&#x27; Bridget ain&#x27;t ever goin&#x27; to</p>
<p>do a tap of work again. I can see that stickin&#x27; out. I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>doctored her an&#x27; doctored her. She&#x27;s fooled the vet, too. An&#x27;</p>
<p>some of the other horses has gotta take a rest. That span of</p>
<p>grays is showin&#x27; the hard work. An&#x27; the big roan&#x27;s goin&#x27; loco.</p>
<p>Everybody thought it was his teeth, but it ain&#x27;t. It&#x27;s straight</p>
<p>loco. It&#x27;s money in pocket to take care of your animals, an&#x27;</p>
<p>horses is the delicatest things on four legs. Some time, if I can</p>
<p>ever see my way to it, I &#x27;m goin&#x27; to ship a carload of mules from</p>
<p>Colusa County--big, heavy ones, you know. They&#x27;d sell like hot</p>
<p>cakes in the valley here--them I didn&#x27;t want for myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Or, in lighter vein, Billy: &quot;By the way, Saxon, talkin&#x27; of</p>
<p>accounts, what d&#x27;you think Hazel an&#x27; Hattie is worth?-- fair</p>
<p>market price,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I &#x27;m askin&#x27; you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, say, what you paid for them--three hundred dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hum.&quot; Billy considered deeply. &quot;They&#x27;re worth a whole lot more,</p>
<p>but let it go at that. An&#x27; now, gettin&#x27; back to accounts, suppose</p>
<p>you write me a check for three hundred dollars.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Robber!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t show me. Why, Saxon, when I let you have grain an&#x27; hay</p>
<p>from my carloads, don&#x27;t you give me a check for it? An&#x27; you know</p>
<p>how you&#x27;re stuck on keepin&#x27; your accounts down to the penny,&quot; he</p>
<p>teased. &quot;If you&#x27;re any kind of a business woman you just gotta</p>
<p>charge your business with them two horses. I ain&#x27;t had the use of</p>
<p>&#x27;em since I don&#x27;t know when.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But the colts will be yours,&quot; she argued. &quot;Besides, I can&#x27;t</p>
<p>afford brood mares in my business. In almost no time, now, Hazel</p>
<p>and Hattie will have to be taken off from the wagon--they&#x27;re too</p>
<p>good for it anyway. And you keep your eyes open for a pair to</p>
<p>take their place. I&#x27;ll give you a check for THAT pair, but no</p>
<p>commission.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; Billy conceded. &quot;Hazel an&#x27; Hattie come back to me;</p>
<p>but you can pay me rent for the time you did use &#x27;em.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you make me, I&#x27;ll charge you board,&quot; she threatened.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; if you charge me board, I&#x27;ll charge you interest for the</p>
<p>money I&#x27;ve stuck into this shebang.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t,&quot; Saxon laughed. &quot;It&#x27;s community property.&quot;</p>
<p>He grunted spasmodically, as if the breath had been knocked out</p>
<p>of him.</p>
<p>&quot;Straight on the solar plexus,&quot; he said, &quot;an&#x27; me down for the</p>
<p>count. But say, them&#x27;s sweet words, ain&#x27;t they.-- community</p>
<p>property.&quot; He rolled them over and off his tongue with keen</p>
<p>relish. &quot;An&#x27; when we got married the top of our ambition was a</p>
<p>steady job an&#x27; some rags an&#x27; sticks of furniture all paid up an&#x27;</p>
<p>half-worn out. We wouldn&#x27;t have had any community property only</p>
<p>for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What nonsense! What could I have done by myself? You know very</p>
<p>well that you earned all the money that started us here. You paid</p>
<p>the wages of Gow Yum and Chan Chi, and old Hughie, and Mrs. Paul,</p>
<p>and--why, you&#x27;ve done it all.&quot;</p>
<p>She drew her two hands caressingly across his shoulders and down</p>
<p>along his great biceps muscles.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s what did it, Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw hell! It&#x27;s your head that done it. What was my muscles good</p>
<p>for with no head to run &#x27;em,--sluggin&#x27; scabs, beatin&#x27; up lodgers,</p>
<p>an&#x27; crookin&#x27; the elbow over a bar. The only sensible thing my</p>
<p>head ever done was when it run me into you. Honest to God, Saxon,</p>
<p>you&#x27;ve been the makin&#x27; of me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aw hell, Billy,&quot; she mimicked in the way that delighted him,</p>
<p>&quot;where would I have been if you hadn&#x27;t taken me out of the</p>
<p>laundry? I couldn&#x27;t take myself out. I was just a helpless girl.</p>
<p>I&#x27;d have been there yet if it hadn&#x27;t been for you. Mrs. Mortimer</p>
<p>had five thousand dollars; but I had you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A woman ain&#x27;t got the chance to help herself that a man has,&quot; he</p>
<p>generalized. &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what: It took the two of us. It&#x27;s</p>
<p>been team-work. We&#x27;ve run in span. If we&#x27;d a-run single, you</p>
<p>might still be in the laundry; an&#x27;, if I was lucky, I&#x27;d be still</p>
<p>drivin&#x27; team by the day an&#x27; sportin&#x27; around to cheap dances.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon stood under the father of all madronos, watching Hazel and</p>
<p>Hattie go out the gate, the full vegetable wagon behind them,</p>
<p>when she saw Billy ride in, leading a sorrel mare from whose</p>
<p>silken coat the sun flashed golden lights.</p>
<p>&quot;Four-year-old, high-life, a handful, but no vicious tricks,&quot;</p>
<p>Billy chanted, as he stopped beside Saxon. &quot;Skin like tissue</p>
<p>paper, mouth like silk, but kill the toughest broncho ever</p>
<p>foaled--look at them lungs an&#x27; nostrils. They call her</p>
<p>Ramona--some Spanish name: sired by Morellita outa genuine Morgan</p>
<p>stock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And they will sell her?&quot; Saxon gasped, standing with hands</p>
<p>clasped in inarticulate delight.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s what I brought her to show you for.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how much must they want for her?&quot; was Saxon&#x27;s next question,</p>
<p>so impossible did it seem that such an amazement of horse-flesh</p>
<p>could ever be hers.</p>
<p>&quot;That ain&#x27;t your business,&quot; Billy answered brusquely. &quot;The</p>
<p>brickyard&#x27;s payin&#x27; for her, not the vegetable ranch. She&#x27;s yourn</p>
<p>at the word. What d&#x27;ye say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you in a minute.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon was trying to mount, but the animal danced nervously away.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on till I tie,&quot; Billy said. &quot;She ain&#x27;t skirt-broke, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>the trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon tightly gripped reins and mane, stepped with spurred foot</p>
<p>on Billy&#x27;s hand, and was lifted lightly into the saddle.</p>
<p>&quot;She&#x27;s used to spurs,&quot; Billy called after. &quot;Spanish broke, so</p>
<p>don&#x27;t check her quick. Come in gentle. An&#x27; talk to her. She&#x27;s</p>
<p>high-life, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon nodded, dashed out the gate and down the road, waved a hand</p>
<p>to Clara Hastings as she passed the gate of Trillium Covert, and</p>
<p>continued up Wild Water canyon.</p>
<p>When she came back, Ramona in a pleasant lather, Saxon rode to</p>
<p>the rear of the house, past the chicken houses and the</p>
<p>flourishing berry-rows, to join Billy on the rim of the bench,</p>
<p>where he sat on his horse in the shade, smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>Together they looked down through an opening among the trees to</p>
<p>the meadow which was a meadow no longer. With mathematical</p>
<p>accuracy it was divided into squares, oblongs, and narrow strips,</p>
<p>which displayed sharply the thousand hues of green of a truck</p>
<p>garden. Gow Yum and Chan Chi, under enormous Chinese grass hats,</p>
<p>were planting green onions. Old Hughie, hoe in hand, plodded</p>
<p>along the main artery of running water, opening certain laterals,</p>
<p>closing others. From the work-shed beyond the barn the strokes of</p>
<p>a hammer told Saxon that Carlsen was wire-binding vegetable</p>
<p>boxes. Mrs. Paul&#x27;s cheery soprano, lifted in a hymn, doated</p>
<p>through the trees, accompanied by the whirr of an egg-beater. A</p>
<p>sharp barking told where Possum still waged hysterical and</p>
<p>baffled war on the Douglass squirrels. Billy took a long draw</p>
<p>from his cigarette, exhaled the smoke, and continued to look down</p>
<p>at the meadow. Saxon divined trouble in his manner. His rein-hand</p>
<p>was on the pommel, and her free hand went out and softly rested</p>
<p>on his. Billy turned his slow gaze upon her mare&#x27;s lather,</p>
<p>seeming not to note it, and continued on to Saxon&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!&quot; he equivocated, as if waking up. &quot;Them San Leandro</p>
<p>Porchugeeze ain&#x27;t got nothin&#x27; on us when it comes to intensive</p>
<p>farmin&#x27;. Look at that water runnin&#x27;. You know, it seems so good</p>
<p>to me that sometimes I just wanta get down on hands an&#x27; knees an&#x27;</p>
<p>lap it all up myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, to have all the water you want in a climate like this!&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; don&#x27;t be scared of it ever goin&#x27; back on you. If the rains</p>
<p>fooled you, there&#x27;s Sonoma Creek alongside. All we gotta do is</p>
<p>install a gasolene pump.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we&#x27;ll never have to, Billy. I was talking with &#x27;Redwood&#x27;</p>
<p>Thompson. He&#x27;s lived in the valley since Fifty-three, and he says</p>
<p>there&#x27;s never been a failure of crops on account of drought. We</p>
<p>always get our rain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, let&#x27;s go for a ride,&quot; he said abruptly. &quot;You&#x27;ve got the</p>
<p>time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right, if you&#x27;ll tell me what&#x27;s bothering you.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked at her quickly.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothin&#x27;,&quot; he grunted. &quot;Yes, there is, too. What&#x27;s the</p>
<p>difference? You&#x27;d know it sooner or later. You ought to see old</p>
<p>Chavon. His face is that long he can&#x27;t walk without bumpin&#x27; his</p>
<p>knee on his chin. His gold-mine&#x27;s peterin&#x27; out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gold mine!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His clay pit. It&#x27;s the same thing. He&#x27;s gettin&#x27; twenty cents a</p>
<p>yard for it from the brickyard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that means the end of your teaming contract.&quot; Saxon saw the</p>
<p>disaster in all its hugeness. &quot;What about the brickyard people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Worried to death, though they&#x27;ve kept secret about it. They&#x27;ve</p>
<p>had men out punchin&#x27; holes all over the hills for a week, an&#x27;</p>
<p>that Jap chemist settin&#x27; up nights analyzin&#x27; the rubbish they&#x27;ve</p>
<p>brought in. It&#x27;s peculiar stuff, that clay, for what they want it</p>
<p>for, an&#x27; you don&#x27;t find it everywhere. Them experts that reported</p>
<p>on Chavon&#x27;s pit made one hell of a mistake. Maybe they was lazy</p>
<p>with their borin&#x27;s. Anyway, they slipped up on the amount of clay</p>
<p>they was in it. Now don&#x27;t get to botherin&#x27;. It&#x27;d come out</p>
<p>somehow. You can&#x27;t do nothin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I can, &quot; Saxon insisted. &quot;We won&#x27;t buy Ramona.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You ain&#x27;t got a thing to do with that,&quot; he answered. &quot;I &#x27;m</p>
<p>buyin&#x27; her, an&#x27; her price don&#x27;t cut any figure alongside the big</p>
<p>game I &#x27;m playin&#x27;. Of course, I can always sell my horses. But</p>
<p>that puts a stop to their makin&#x27; money, an&#x27; that brickyard</p>
<p>contract was fat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But if you get some of them in on the road work for the county?&quot;</p>
<p>she suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I got that in mind. An&#x27; I &#x27;m keepin&#x27; my eyes open. They&#x27;s a</p>
<p>chance the quarry will start again, an&#x27; the fellow that did that</p>
<p>teamin&#x27; has gone to Puget Sound. An&#x27; what if I have to sell out</p>
<p>most of the horses? Here&#x27;s you and the vegetable business. That&#x27;s</p>
<p>solid. We just don&#x27;t go ahead so fast for a time, that&#x27;s all. I</p>
<p>ain&#x27;t scared of the country any more. I sized things up as we</p>
<p>went along. They ain&#x27;t a jerk burg we hit all the time on the</p>
<p>road that I couldn&#x27;t jump into an&#x27; make a go. An&#x27; now where d&#x27;you</p>
<p>want to ride?&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII</p>
<p>They cantered out the gate, thundered across the bridge, and</p>
<p>passed Trillium Covert before they pulled in on the grade of Wild</p>
<p>Water Canyon. Saxon had chosen her field on the big spur of</p>
<p>Sonoma Mountains as the objective of their ride.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, I bumped into something big this mornin&#x27; when I was goin&#x27;</p>
<p>to fetch Ramona,&quot; Billy said, the clay pit trouble banished for</p>
<p>the time. &quot;You know the hundred an&#x27; forty. I passed young Chavon</p>
<p>along the road, an&#x27;--I don&#x27;t know why--just for ducks, I guess--I</p>
<p>up an&#x27; asked &#x27;m if he thought the old man would lease the hundred</p>
<p>an&#x27; forty to me. An&#x27; what d &#x27;you think! He said the old man</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t own it. Was just leasin&#x27; it himself. That&#x27;s how we was</p>
<p>always seein&#x27; his cattle on it. It&#x27;s a gouge into his land, for</p>
<p>he owns everything on three sides of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Next I met Ping. He said Hilyard owned it an&#x27; was willin&#x27; to</p>
<p>sell, only Chavon didn&#x27;t have the price. Then, comin&#x27; back, I</p>
<p>looked in on Payne. He&#x27;s quit blacksmithin&#x27;--his back&#x27;s hurtin&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;m from a kick--an&#x27; just startin&#x27; in for real estate. Sure, he</p>
<p>said, Hilyard would sell, an&#x27; had already listed the land with</p>
<p>&#x27;m. Chavon&#x27;s over-pastured it, an&#x27; Hilyard won&#x27;t give &#x27;m another</p>
<p>lease.&quot;</p>
<p>When they had climbed out of Wild Water Canyon they turned their</p>
<p>horses about and halted on the rim where they could look across</p>
<p>at the three densely wooded knolls in the midst of the desired</p>
<p>hundred and forty.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll get it yet,&quot; Saxon said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure we will,&quot; Billy agreed with careless certitude. &quot;I&#x27;ve ben</p>
<p>lookin&#x27; over the big adobe barn again. Just the thing for a raft</p>
<p>of horses, an&#x27; a new roof&#x27;ll be cheaper &#x27;n I thought. Though</p>
<p>neither Chavon or me&#x27;ll be in the market to buy it right away,</p>
<p>with the clay pinchin&#x27; out.&quot;</p>
<p>When they reached Saxon&#x27;s field, which they had learned was the</p>
<p>property of Redwood Thompson, they tied the horses and entered it</p>
<p>on foot. The hay, just cut, was being raked by Thompson, who</p>
<p>hallo&#x27;d a greeting to them. It was a cloudless, windless day, and</p>
<p>they sought refuge from the sun in the woods beyond. They</p>
<p>encountered a dim trail.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a cow trail,&quot; Billy declared. &quot;I bet they&#x27;s a teeny pasture</p>
<p>tucked away somewhere in them trees. Let&#x27;s follow it.&quot;</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, several hundred feet up the side of</p>
<p>the spur, they emerged on an open, grassy space of bare hillside.</p>
<p>Most of the hundred and forty, two miles away, lay beneath them,</p>
<p>while they were level with the tops of the three knolls. Billy</p>
<p>paused to gaze upon the much-desired land, and Saxon joined him.</p>
<p>&quot;What is that?&quot; she asked, pointing toward the knolls. &quot;Up the</p>
<p>little canyon, to the left of it, there on the farthest knoll,</p>
<p>right under that spruce that&#x27;s leaning over.&quot;</p>
<p>What Billy saw was a white scar on the canyon wall.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s one on me,&quot; he said, studying the scar. &quot;I thought I knew</p>
<p>every inch of that land, but I never seen that before. Why, I was</p>
<p>right in there at the head of the canyon the first part of the</p>
<p>winter. It&#x27;s awful wild. Walls of the canyon like the sides of a</p>
<p>steeple an&#x27; covered with thick woods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked. &quot;A slide?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Must be--brought down by the heavy rains. If I don&#x27;t miss my</p>
<p>guess--&quot; Billy broke off, forgetting in the intensity with which</p>
<p>he continued to look.</p>
<p>&quot;Hilyard&#x27;ll sell for thirty an acre,&quot; he began again,</p>
<p>disconnectedly. &quot;Good land, bad land, an&#x27; all, just as it runs,</p>
<p>thirty an acre. That&#x27;s forty-two hundred. Payne&#x27;s new at real</p>
<p>estate, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll make &#x27;m split his commission an&#x27; get the easiest</p>
<p>terms ever. We can re-borrow that four hundred from Gow Yum, an&#x27;</p>
<p>I can borrow money on my horses an&#x27; wagons--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going to buy it to-day?&quot; Saxon teased.</p>
<p>She scarcely touched the edge of his thought. He looked at her,</p>
<p>as if he had heard, then forgot her the next moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Head work,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Head work. If I don&#x27;t put over a hot</p>
<p>one--&quot;</p>
<p>He started back down the cow trail, recollected Saxon, and called</p>
<p>over his shoulder:</p>
<p>&quot;Come on. Let&#x27;s hustle. I wanta ride over an&#x27; look at that.&quot;</p>
<p>So rapidly did he go down the trail and across the field, that</p>
<p>Saxon had no time for questions. She was almost breathless from</p>
<p>her effort to keep up with him.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she begged, as he lifted her to the saddle.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it&#x27;s all a joke--I&#x27;ll tell you about it afterward,&quot; he put</p>
<p>her off.</p>
<p>They galloped on the levels, trotted down the gentler slopes of</p>
<p>road, and not until on the steep descent of Wild Water canyon did</p>
<p>they rein to a walk. Billy&#x27;s preoccupation was gone, and Saxon</p>
<p>took advantage to broach a subject which had been on her mind for</p>
<p>some time.</p>
<p>&quot;Clara Hastings told me the other day that they&#x27;re going to have</p>
<p>a house party. The Hazards are to be there, and the Halls, and</p>
<p>Roy Blanchard....&quot;</p>
<p>She looked at Billy anxiously. At the mention of Blanchard his</p>
<p>head had tossed up as to a bugle call. Slowly a whimsical twinkle</p>
<p>began to glint up through the cloudy blue of his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a long time since you told any man he was standing on his</p>
<p>foot,&quot; she ventured slyly</p>
<p>Billy began to grin sheepishly.</p>
<p>&quot;Aw, that&#x27;s all right,&quot; he said in mock-lordly fashion. &quot;Roy</p>
<p>Blanchard can come. I&#x27;ll let &#x27;m. All that was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Besides, I &#x27;m too busy to fool with such things.&quot;</p>
<p>He urged his horse on at a faster walk, and as soon as the slope</p>
<p>lessened broke into a trot. At Trillium Covert they were</p>
<p>galloping.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll have to stop for dinner first,&quot; Saxon said, as they</p>
<p>neared the gate of Madrono Ranch.</p>
<p>&quot;You stop,&quot; he answered. &quot;I don&#x27;t want no dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I want to go with you,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;What is it? &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t dast tell you. You go on in an&#x27; get your dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not after that,&quot; she said. &quot;Nothing can keep me from coming</p>
<p>along now.&quot;</p>
<p>Half a mile farther on, they left the highway, passed through a</p>
<p>patent gate which Billy had installed, and crossed the fields on</p>
<p>a road which was coated thick with chalky dust. This was the road</p>
<p>that led to Chavon&#x27;s clay pit. The hundred and forty lay to the</p>
<p>west. Two wagons, in a cloud of dust, came into sight.</p>
<p>&quot;Your teams, Billy,&quot; cried Saxon. &quot;Think of it! Just by the use</p>
<p>of the head, earning your money while you&#x27;re riding around with</p>
<p>me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Makes me ashamed to think how much cash money each one of them</p>
<p>teams is bringin&#x27; me in every day,&quot; he acknowledged.</p>
<p>They were turning off from the road toward the bars which gave</p>
<p>entrance to the one hundred and forty, when the driver of the</p>
<p>foremost wagon hallo&#x27;d and waved his hand. They drew in their</p>
<p>horses and waited.</p>
<p>&quot;The big roan&#x27;s broke loose,&quot; the dryer said, as he stopped</p>
<p>beside them. &quot;Clean crazy loco--bitin&#x27;, squealin&#x27;, strikin&#x27;,</p>
<p>kickin&#x27;. Kicked clean out of the harness like it was paper. Bit a</p>
<p>chunk out of Baldy the size of a saucer, an&#x27; wound up by breakin&#x27;</p>
<p>his own hind leg. Liveliest fifteen minutes I ever seen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure it&#x27;s broke?&quot; Billy demanded sharply.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, after you unload, drive around by the other barn and get</p>
<p>Ben. He&#x27;s in the corral. Tell Matthews to be easy with &#x27;m. An&#x27;</p>
<p>get a gun. Sammy&#x27;s got one. You&#x27;ll have to see to the briig roan.</p>
<p>I ain&#x27;t got time now.--Why couldn&#x27;t Matthews a-come along with</p>
<p>you for Ben? You&#x27;d save time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, he&#x27;s just stickin&#x27;around waitin&#x27;,&quot; the driver answered. &quot;He</p>
<p>reckoned I could get Ben.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; lose time, eh? Well, get a move on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the way of it,&quot; Billy growled to Saxon as they rode on.</p>
<p>&quot;No savve. No head. One man settin&#x27; down an&#x27; holdin his hands</p>
<p>while another team drives outa its way doin what he oughta done.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the trouble with two-dollar-a-day men.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With two-dollar-a-day heads,&quot; Saxon said quickly.&quot;What kind of</p>
<p>heads do you expect for two dollars?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, too,&quot; Billy acknowledged the hit. &quot;If they had</p>
<p>better heads they&#x27;d be in the cities like all the rest of the</p>
<p>better men. An&#x27; the better men are a lot of dummies, too. They</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know the big chances in the country, or you couldn&#x27;t hold</p>
<p>&#x27;m from it.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy dismounted, took the three bars down, led his horse</p>
<p>through, then put up the bars.</p>
<p>&quot;When I get this place, there&#x27;ll be a gate here,&quot; he announced.</p>
<p>&quot;Pay for itself in no time. It&#x27;s the thousan&#x27; an&#x27; one little</p>
<p>things like this that count up big when you put &#x27;m together.&quot; He</p>
<p>sighed contentedly. &quot;I never used to think about such things, but</p>
<p>when we shook Oakland I began to wise up. It was them San Leandro</p>
<p>Porchugeeze that gave me my first eye-opener. I&#x27;d been asleep,</p>
<p>before that.&quot;</p>
<p>They skirted the lower of the three fields where the ripe hay</p>
<p>stood uncut. Billy pointed with eloquent disgust to a break in</p>
<p>the fence, slovenly repaired, and on to the standing grain</p>
<p>much-trampled by cattle.</p>
<p>&quot;Them&#x27;s the things,&quot; he criticized. &quot;Old style. An&#x27; look how thin</p>
<p>that crop is, an&#x27; the shallow plowin&#x27;. Scrub cattle, scrub seed,</p>
<p>scrub farmin&#x27;. Chavon&#x27;s worked it for eight years now, an&#x27; never</p>
<p>rested it once, never put anything in for what he took out,</p>
<p>except the cattle into the stubble the minute the hay was on.&quot;</p>
<p>In a pasture glade, farther on, they came upon a bunch of cattle.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at that bull, Saxon. Scrub&#x27;s no name for it. They oughta be</p>
<p>a state law against lettin&#x27; such animals exist. No wonder</p>
<p>Chavon&#x27;s that land poor he&#x27;s had to sink all his clay-pit</p>
<p>earnin&#x27;s into taxes an&#x27; interest. He can&#x27;t make his land pay.</p>
<p>Take this hundred an forty. Anybody with the savve can just rake</p>
<p>silver dollars offen it. I&#x27;ll show &#x27;m.&quot;</p>
<p>They passed the big adobe barn in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;A few dollars at the right time would a-saved hundreds on that</p>
<p>roof,&quot; Billy commented. &quot;Well, anyway, I won&#x27;t be payin&#x27; for any</p>
<p>improvements when I buy. An I&#x27;ll tell you another thing. This</p>
<p>ranch is full of water, and if Glen Ellen ever grows they&#x27;ll have</p>
<p>to come to see me for their water supply.&quot;</p>
<p>Billy knew the ranch thoroughly, and took short-cuts through the</p>
<p>woods by way of cattle paths. Once, he reined in abruptly, and</p>
<p>both stopped. Confronting them, a dozen paces away, was a</p>
<p>half-grown red fox. For half a minute, with beady eyes, the wild</p>
<p>thing studied them, with twitching sensitive nose reading the</p>
<p>messages of the air. Then, velvet-footed, it leapt aside and was</p>
<p>gone among the trees.</p>
<p>&quot;The son-of-a-gun!&quot; Billy ejaculated.</p>
<p>As they approached Wild Water; they rode out into a long narrow</p>
<p>meadow. In the middle was a pond.</p>
<p>&quot;Natural reservoir, when Glen Ellen begins to buy water,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>said. &quot;See, down at the lower end there?--wouldn&#x27;t cost anything</p>
<p>hardly to throw a dam across. An&#x27; I can pipe in all kinds of</p>
<p>hill-drip. An&#x27; water&#x27;s goin&#x27; to be money in this valley not a</p>
<p>thousan&#x27; years from now.--An&#x27; all the ginks, an&#x27; boobs, an&#x27; dubs,</p>
<p>an&#x27; gazabos poundin&#x27; their ear deado an&#x27; not seein&#x27; it</p>
<p>comin.--An&#x27; surveyors workin&#x27; up the valley for an electric road</p>
<p>from Sausalito with a branch up Napa Valley.&quot;</p>
<p>They came to the rim of Wild Water canyon. Leaning far back in</p>
<p>their saddles, they slid the horses down a steep declivity,</p>
<p>through big spruce woods, to an ancient and all but obliterated</p>
<p>trail.</p>
<p>&quot;They cut this trail &#x27;way back in the Fifties,&quot; Billy explained.</p>
<p>&quot;I only found it by accident. Then I asked Poppe yesterday. He</p>
<p>was born in the valley. He said it was a fake minin&#x27; rush across</p>
<p>from Petaluma. The gamblers got it up, an&#x27; they must a-drawn a</p>
<p>thousan&#x27; suckers. You see that flat there, an&#x27; the old stumps.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s where the camp was. They set the tables up under the</p>
<p>trees. The flat used to be bigger, but the creek&#x27;s eaten into it.</p>
<p>Poppe said they was a couple of killin&#x27;s an&#x27; one lynchin&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>Lying low against their horses&#x27; necks, they scrambled up a steep</p>
<p>cattle trail out of the canyon, and began to work across rough</p>
<p>country toward the knolls.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon, you&#x27;re always lookin&#x27; for something pretty. I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>show you what&#x27;ll make your hair stand up . . . soon as we get</p>
<p>through this manzanita.&quot;</p>
<p>Never, in all their travels, had Saxon seen so lovely a vista as</p>
<p>the one that greeted them when they emerged. The dim trail lay</p>
<p>like a rambling red shadow cast on the soft forest floor by the</p>
<p>great redwoods and over-arching oaks. It seemed as if all local</p>
<p>varieties of trees and vines had conspired to weave the leafy</p>
<p>roof--maples, big madronos and laurels, and lofty tan-bark oaks,</p>
<p>scaled and wrapped and interwound with wild grape and flaming</p>
<p>poison oak. Saxon drew Billy&#x27;s eyes to a mossy bank of</p>
<p>five-finger ferns. All slopes seemed to meet to form this basin</p>
<p>and colossal forest bower. Underfoot the floor was spongy with</p>
<p>water. An invisible streamlet whispered under broad-fronded</p>
<p>brakes. On every hand opened tiny vistas of enchantment, where</p>
<p>young redwoods grouped still and stately about fallen giants,</p>
<p>shoulder-high to the horses, moss-covered and dissolving into</p>
<p>mold.</p>
<p>At last, after another quarter of an hour, they tied their horses</p>
<p>on the rim of the narrow canyon that penetrated the wilderness of</p>
<p>the knolls. Through a rift in the trees Billy pointed to the top</p>
<p>of the leaning spruce.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s right under that,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;ll have to follow up the</p>
<p>bed of the creek. They ain&#x27;t no trail, though you&#x27;ll see plenty</p>
<p>of deer paths crossin&#x27; the creek. You&#x27;ll get your feet wet.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon laughed her joy and held on close to his heels, splashing</p>
<p>through pools, crawling hand and foot up the slippery faces of</p>
<p>water-worn rocks, and worming under trunks of old fallen trees.</p>
<p>&quot;They ain&#x27;t no real bed-rock in the whole mountain,&quot; Billy</p>
<p>elucidated, &quot;so the stream cuts deeper&#x27;n deeper, an&#x27; that keeps</p>
<p>the sides cavin&#x27; in. They&#x27;re as steep as they can be without</p>
<p>fallin&#x27; down. A little farther up, the canyon ain&#x27;t much more&#x27;n a</p>
<p>crack in the ground--but a mighty deep one if anybody should ask</p>
<p>you. You can spit across it an&#x27; break your neck in it.&quot;</p>
<p>The climbing grew more difficult, and they were finally halted,</p>
<p>in a narrow cleft, by a drift-jam.</p>
<p>&quot;You wait here,&quot; Billy directed, and, lying flat, squirmed on</p>
<p>through crashing brush.</p>
<p>Saxon waited till all sound had died away. She waited ten minutes</p>
<p>longer, then followed by the way Billy had broken. Where the bed</p>
<p>of the canyon became impossible, she came upon what she was sure</p>
<p>was a deer path that skirted the steep side and was a tunnel</p>
<p>through the close greenery. She caught a glimpse of the</p>
<p>overhanging spruce, almost above her head on the opposite side,</p>
<p>and emerged on a pool of clear water in a clay-like basin. This</p>
<p>basin was of recent origin, having been formed by a slide of</p>
<p>earth and trees. Across the pool arose an almost sheer wall of</p>
<p>white. She recognized it for what it was, and looked about for</p>
<p>Billy. She heard him whistle, and looked up. Two hundred feet</p>
<p>above, at the perilous top of the white wall, he was holding on</p>
<p>to a tree trunk. The overhanging spruce was nearby.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see the little pasture back of your field,&quot; he called</p>
<p>down. &quot;No wonder nobody ever piped this off. The only place they</p>
<p>could see it from is that speck of pasture. An&#x27; you saw it first.</p>
<p>Wait till I come down and tell you all about it. I didn&#x27;t dast</p>
<p>before.&quot;</p>
<p>It required no shrewdness to guess the truth. Saxon knew this was</p>
<p>the precious clay required by the brickyard. Billy circled wide</p>
<p>of the slide and came down the canyon-wall, from tree to tree, as</p>
<p>descending a ladder.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t it a peach?&quot; he exulted, as he dropped beside her. &quot;Just</p>
<p>look at it--hidden away under four feet of soil where nobody</p>
<p>could see it, an&#x27; just waitin&#x27; for us to hit the Valley of the</p>
<p>Moon. Then it up an&#x27; slides a piece of the skin off so as we can</p>
<p>see it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it the real clay?&quot; Saxon asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;You bet your sweet life. I&#x27;ve handled too much of it not to know</p>
<p>it in the dark. Just rub a piece between your fingers.--Like</p>
<p>that. Why, I could tell by the taste of it. I&#x27;ve eaten enough of</p>
<p>the dust of the teams. Here&#x27;s where our fun begins. Why, you know</p>
<p>we&#x27;ve been workin&#x27; our heads off since we hit this valley. Now</p>
<p>we&#x27;re on Easy street.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you don&#x27;t own it,&quot; Saxon objected.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you won&#x27;t be a hundred years old before I do. Straight</p>
<p>from here I hike to Payne an&#x27; bind the bargain --an option, you</p>
<p>know, while title&#x27;s searchin&#x27; an&#x27; I &#x27;m raisin&#x27; money. We&#x27;ll</p>
<p>borrow that four hundred back again from Gow Yum, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll borrow</p>
<p>all I can get on my horses an&#x27; wagons, an&#x27; Hazel and Hattie, an&#x27;</p>
<p>everything that&#x27;s worth a cent. An&#x27; then I get the deed with a</p>
<p>mortgage on it to Hilyard for the balance. An&#x27; then--it&#x27;s takin&#x27;</p>
<p>candy from a baby--I&#x27;ll contract with the brickyard for twenty</p>
<p>cents a yard--maybe more. They&#x27;ll be crazy with joy when they see</p>
<p>it. Don&#x27;t need any borin&#x27;s. They&#x27;s nearly two hundred feet of it</p>
<p>exposed up an&#x27; down. The whole knoll&#x27;s clay, with a skin of soil</p>
<p>over it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you&#x27;ll spoil all the beautiful canyon hauling out the clay,&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon cried with alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;Nope; only the knoll. The road&#x27;ll come in from the other side.</p>
<p>It&#x27;ll be only half a mile to Chavon&#x27;s pit. I&#x27;ll build the road</p>
<p>an&#x27; charge steeper teamin&#x27;, or the brickyard can build it an&#x27;</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll team for the same rate as before. An&#x27; twenty cents a yard</p>
<p>pourin&#x27; in, all profit, from the jump. I&#x27;ll sure have to buy more</p>
<p>horses to do the work.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat hand in hand beside the pool and talked over the</p>
<p>details.</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Saxon,&quot; Billy said, after a pause had fallen, &quot;sing</p>
<p>&#x27;Harvest Days,&#x27; won&#x27;t you?&quot;</p>
<p>And, when she had complied: &quot;The first time you sung that song</p>
<p>for me was comin&#x27; home from the picnic on the train--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The very first day we met each other,&quot; she broke in. &quot;What did</p>
<p>you think about me that day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, what I&#x27;ve thought ever since--that you was made for me.--I</p>
<p>thought that right at the jump, in the first waltz. An&#x27; what&#x27;d</p>
<p>you think of me?</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I wondered, and before the first waltz, too, when we were</p>
<p>introduced and shook hands--I wondered if you were the man. Those</p>
<p>were the very words that flashed into my mind.--IS HE THE MAN?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; I kinda looked a little some good to you?&quot; he queried.</p>
<p>&quot;_I_thought so, and my eyesight has always been good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Say!&quot; Billy went off at a tangent. &quot;By next winter, with</p>
<p>everything hummin&#x27; an&#x27; shipshape, what&#x27;s the matter with us</p>
<p>makin&#x27; a visit to Carmel? It&#x27;ll be slack time for you with the</p>
<p>vegetables, an&#x27; I&#x27;ll be able to afford a foreman.&quot;</p>
<p>Saxon&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm surprised him.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; he demanded quickly.</p>
<p>With downcast demurest eyes and hesitating speech, Saxon said:</p>
<p>&quot;I did something yesterday without asking your advice, Billy.&quot;</p>
<p>He waited.</p>
<p>&quot;I wrote to Tom,&quot; she added, with an air of timid confession.</p>
<p>Still he waited--for he knew not what.</p>
<p>&quot;I asked him to ship up the old chest of drawers--my mother&#x27;s,</p>
<p>you remember--that we stored with him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh! I don&#x27;t see anything outa the way about that,&quot; Billy said</p>
<p>with relief. &quot;We need the chest, don&#x27;t we? An&#x27; we can afford to</p>
<p>pay the freight on it, can&#x27;t we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are a dear stupid man, that&#x27;s what you are. Don&#x27;t you know</p>
<p>what is in the chest?&quot;</p>
<p>He shook his head, and what she added was so soft that it was</p>
<p>almost a whisper:</p>
<p>&quot;The baby clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;True.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure?&quot;</p>
<p>She nodded her head, her cheeks flooding with quick color.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s what I wanted, Saxon, more&#x27;n anything else in the world.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve been thinkin&#x27; a whole lot about it lately, ever since we hit</p>
<p>the valley,&quot; he went on, brokenly, and for the first time she saw</p>
<p>tears unmistakable in his eyes. &quot;But after all I&#x27;d done, an&#x27; the</p>
<p>hell I&#x27;d raised, an&#x27; everything, I . . . I never urged you, or</p>
<p>said a word about it. But I wanted it . . . oh, I wanted it like</p>
<p>. . . like I want you now.&quot;</p>
<p>His open arms received her, and the pool in the heart of the</p>
<p>canyon knew a tender silence.</p>
<p>Saxon felt Billy&#x27;s finger laid warningly on her lips. Guided by</p>
<p>his hand, she turned her head back, and together they gazed far</p>
<p>up the side of the knoll where a doe and a spotted fawn looked</p>
<p>down upon them from a tiny open space between the trees.</p>
<p>End</p>
