<p>THEAETETUS</p>
<p>PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: SOCRATES; THEODORUS; THEAETETUS</p>
<p>Euclid and Terpsion meet in front of Euclid&#x27;s house in Megara; they</p>
<p>enter the house, and the dialogue is read to them by a servant.</p>
<p>Euclid. Have you only just arrived from the country, Terpsion?</p>
<p>Terpsion. No, I came some time ago: and I have been in the Agora</p>
<p>looking for you, and wondering that I could not find you.</p>
<p>Euc. But I was not in the city.</p>
<p>Terp. Where then?</p>
<p>Euc. As I was going down to the harbour, I met Theaetetus-he was</p>
<p>being carried up to Athens from the army at Corinth.</p>
<p>Terp. Was he alive or dead?</p>
<p>Euc. He was scarcely alive, for he has been badly wounded; but he</p>
<p>was suffering even more from the sickness which has broken out in</p>
<p>the army.</p>
<p>Terp. The dysentery, you mean?</p>
<p>Euc. Yes.</p>
<p>Terp. Alas! what a loss he will be!</p>
<p>Euc. Yes, Terpsion, he is a noble fellow; only to-day I heard some</p>
<p>people highly praising his behaviour in this very battle.</p>
<p>Terp. No wonder; I should rather be surprised at hearing anything</p>
<p>else of him. But why did he go on, instead of stopping at Megara?</p>
<p>Euc. He wanted to get home: although I entreated and advised him</p>
<p>to remain he would not listen to me; so I set him on his way, and</p>
<p>turned back, and then I remembered what Socrates had said of him,</p>
<p>and thought how remarkably this, like all his predictions, had been</p>
<p>fulfilled. I believe that he had seen him a little before his own</p>
<p>death, when Theaetetus was a youth, and he had a memorable</p>
<p>conversation with him, which he repeated to me when I came to</p>
<p>Athens; he was full of admiration of his genius, and said that he</p>
<p>would most certainly be a great man, if he lived.</p>
<p>Terp. The prophecy has certainly been fulfilled; but what was the</p>
<p>conversation? can you tell me?</p>
<p>Euc. No, indeed, not offhand; but I took notes of it as soon as I</p>
<p>got home; these I filled up from memory, writing them out at</p>
<p>leisure; and whenever I went to Athens, I asked Socrates about any</p>
<p>point which I had forgotten, and on my return I made corrections; thus</p>
<p>I have nearly the whole conversation written down.</p>
<p>Terp. I remember-you told me; and I have always been intending to</p>
<p>ask you to show me the writing, but have put off doing so; and now,</p>
<p>why should we not read it through?-having just come from the</p>
<p>country, I should greatly like to rest.</p>
<p>Euc. I too shall be very glad of a rest, for I went with</p>
<p>Theaetetus as far as Erineum. Let us go in, then, and, while we are</p>
<p>reposing, the servant shall read to us.</p>
<p>Terp. Very good.</p>
<p>Euc. Here is the roll, Terpsion; I may observe that I have</p>
<p>introduced Socrates, not as narrating to me, but as actually</p>
<p>conversing with the persons whom he mentioned-these were, Theodorus</p>
<p>the geometrician (of Cyrene), and Theaetetus. I have omitted, for</p>
<p>the sake of convenience, the interlocutory words &quot;I said,&quot; &quot;I</p>
<p>remarked,&quot; which he used when he spoke of himself, and again, &quot;he</p>
<p>agreed,&quot; or &quot;disagreed,&quot; in the answer, lest the repetition of them</p>
<p>should be troublesome.</p>
<p>Terp. Quite right, Euclid.</p>
<p>Euc. And now, boy, you may take the roll and read.</p>

<p>Socrates. If I cared enough about the Cyrenians, Theodorus, I</p>
<p>would ask you whether there are any rising geometricians or</p>
<p>philosophers in that part of the world. But I am more interested in</p>
<p>our own Athenian youth, and I would rather know who among them are</p>
<p>likely to do well. I observe them as far as I can myself, and I</p>
<p>enquire of any one whom they follow, and I see that a great many of</p>
<p>them follow you, in which they are quite right, considering your</p>
<p>eminence in geometry and in other ways. Tell me then, if you have</p>
<p>met with any one who is good for anything.</p>
<p>Theodorus. Yes, Socrates, I have become acquainted with one very</p>
<p>remarkable Athenian youth, whom I commend to you as well worthy of</p>
<p>your attention. If he had been a beauty I should have been afraid to</p>
<p>praise him, lest you should suppose that I was in love with him; but</p>
<p>he is no beauty, and you must not be offended if I say that he is very</p>
<p>like you; for he has a snub nose and projecting eyes, although these</p>
<p>features are less marked in him than in you. Seeing, then, that he has</p>
<p>no personal attractions, I may freely say, that in all my</p>
<p>acquaintance, which is very large, I never knew anyone who was his</p>
<p>equal in natural gifts: for he has a quickness of apprehension which</p>
<p>is almost unrivalled, and he is exceedingly gentle, and also the</p>
<p>most courageous of men; there is a union of qualities in him such as I</p>
<p>have never seen in any other, and should scarcely have thought</p>
<p>possible; for those who, like him, have quick and ready and</p>
<p>retentive wits, have generally also quick tempers; they are ships</p>
<p>without ballast, and go darting about, and are mad rather than</p>
<p>courageous; and the steadier sort, when they have to face study, prove</p>
<p>stupid and cannot remember. Whereas he moves surely and smoothly and</p>
<p>successfully in the path of knowledge and enquiry; and he is full of</p>
<p>gentleness, flowing on silently like a river of oil; at his age, it is</p>
<p>wonderful.</p>
<p>Soc. That is good news; whose son is he?</p>
<p>Theod. The name of his father I have forgotten, but the youth</p>
<p>himself is the middle one of those who are approaching us; he and</p>
<p>his companions have been anointing themselves in the outer court,</p>
<p>and now they seem to have finished, and are towards us. Look and see</p>
<p>whether you know him.</p>
<p>Soc. I know the youth, but I do not know his name; he is the son</p>
<p>of Euphronius the Sunian, who was himself an eminent man, and such</p>
<p>another as his son is, according to your account of him; I believe</p>
<p>that he left a considerable fortune.</p>
<p>Theod. Theaetetus, Socrates, is his name; but I rather think that</p>
<p>the property disappeared in the hands of trustees; notwithstanding</p>
<p>which he is wonderfully liberal.</p>
<p>Soc. He must be a fine fellow; tell him to come and sit by me.</p>
<p>Theod. I will. Come hither, Theaetetus, and sit by Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. By all means, Theaetetus, in order that I may see the</p>
<p>reflection of myself in your face, for Theodorus says that we are</p>
<p>alike; and yet if each of us held in his hands a lyre, and he said</p>
<p>that they were, tuned alike, should we at once take his word, or</p>
<p>should we ask whether he who said so was or was not a musician?</p>
<p>Theaetetus. We should ask.</p>
<p>Soc. And if we found that he was, we should take his word; and if</p>
<p>not, not?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And if this supposed, likeness of our faces is a matter of</p>
<p>any interest to us we should enquire whether he who says that we are</p>
<p>alike is a painter or not?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly we should.</p>
<p>Soc. And is Theodorus a painter?</p>
<p>Theaet. I never heard that he was.</p>
<p>Soc. Is he a geometrician?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course he is, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. And is he an astronomer and calculator and musician, and in</p>
<p>general an educated man?</p>
<p>Theaet. I think so.</p>
<p>Soc. If, then, he remarks on a similarity in our persons, either</p>
<p>by way of praise or blame, there is no particular reason why we should</p>
<p>attend to him.</p>
<p>Theaet. I should say not.</p>
<p>Soc. But if he praises the virtue or wisdom which are the mental</p>
<p>endowments of either of us, then he who hears the praises will</p>
<p>naturally desire to examine him who is praised: and he again should be</p>
<p>willing to exhibit himself.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. Then now is the time, my dear Theaetetus, for me to examine,</p>
<p>and for you to exhibit; since although Theodorus has praised many a</p>
<p>citizen and stranger in my hearing, never did I hear him praise any</p>
<p>one as he has been praising you.</p>
<p>Theaet. I am glad to hear it, Socrates; but what if he was only in</p>
<p>jest?</p>
<p>Soc. Nay, Theodorus is not given to jesting; and I cannot allow</p>
<p>you to retract your consent on any such pretence as that. If you do,</p>
<p>he will have to swear to his words; and we are perfectly sure that</p>
<p>no one will be found to impugn him. Do not be shy then, but stand to</p>
<p>your word.</p>
<p>Theaet. I suppose I must, if you wish it.</p>
<p>Soc. In the first place, I should like to ask what you learn of</p>
<p>Theodorus: something of geometry, perhaps?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And astronomy and harmony and calculation?</p>
<p>Theaet. I do my best.</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, my boy, and so do I: and my desire is to learn of him,</p>
<p>or of anybody who seems to understand these things. And I get on</p>
<p>pretty well in general; but there is a little difficulty which I</p>
<p>want you and the company to aid me in investigating. Will you answer</p>
<p>me a question: &quot;Is not learning growing wiser about that which you</p>
<p>learn?&quot;</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course.</p>
<p>Soc. And by wisdom the wise are wise?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And is that different in any way from knowledge?</p>
<p>Theaet. What?</p>
<p>Soc. Wisdom; are not men wise in that which they know?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly they are.</p>
<p>Soc. Then wisdom and knowledge are the same?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Herein lies the difficulty which I can never solve to my</p>
<p>satisfaction-What is knowledge? Can we answer that question? What</p>
<p>say you? which of us will speak first? whoever misses shall sit</p>
<p>down, as at a game of ball, and shall be donkey, as the boys say; he</p>
<p>who lasts out his competitors in the game without missing, shall be</p>
<p>our king, and shall have the right of putting to us any questions</p>
<p>which he pleases. .. Why is there no reply? I hope, Theodorus, that</p>
<p>I am not betrayed into rudeness by my love of conversation? I only</p>
<p>want to make us talk and be friendly and sociable.</p>
<p>Theod. The reverse of rudeness, Socrates: but I would rather that</p>
<p>you would ask one of the young fellows; for the truth is, that I am</p>
<p>unused to your game of question and answer, and I am too old to learn;</p>
<p>the young will be more suitable, and they will improve more than I</p>
<p>shall, for youth is always able to improve. And so having made a</p>
<p>beginning with Theaetetus, I would advise you to go on with him and</p>
<p>not let him off.</p>
<p>Soc. Do you hear, Theaetetus, what Theodorus says? The</p>
<p>philosopher, whom you would not like to disobey, and whose word</p>
<p>ought to be a command to a young man, bids me interrogate you. Take</p>
<p>courage, then, and nobly say what you think that knowledge is.</p>
<p>Theaet. Well, Socrates, I will answer as you and he bid me; and if</p>
<p>make a mistake, you will doubtless correct me.</p>
<p>Soc. We will, if we can.</p>
<p>Theaet. Then, I think that the sciences which I learn from</p>
<p>Theodorus-geometry, and those which you just now mentioned-are</p>
<p>knowledge; and I would include the art of the cobbler and other</p>
<p>craftsmen; these, each and all of, them, are knowledge.</p>
<p>Soc. Too much, Theaetetus, too much; the nobility and liberality</p>
<p>of your nature make you give many and diverse things, when I am asking</p>
<p>for one simple thing.</p>
<p>Theaet. What do you mean, Socrates?</p>
<p>Soc. Perhaps nothing. I will endeavour, however, to explain what I</p>
<p>believe to be my meaning: When you speak of cobbling, you mean the art</p>
<p>or science of making shoes?</p>
<p>Theaet. Just so.</p>
<p>Soc. And when you speak of carpentering, you mean the art of</p>
<p>making wooden implements?</p>
<p>Theaet. I do.</p>
<p>Soc. In both cases you define the subject matter of each of the</p>
<p>two arts?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. But that, Theaetetus, was not the point of my question: we</p>
<p>wanted to know not the subjects, nor yet the number of the arts or</p>
<p>sciences, for we were not going to count them, but we wanted to know</p>
<p>the nature of knowledge in the abstract. Am I not right?</p>
<p>Theaet. Perfectly right.</p>
<p>Soc. Let me offer an illustration: Suppose that a person were to ask</p>
<p>about some very trivial and obvious thing-for example, What is clay?</p>
<p>and we were to reply, that there is a clay of potters, there is a clay</p>
<p>of oven-makers, there is a clay of brick-makers; would not the</p>
<p>answer be ridiculous?</p>
<p>Theaet. Truly.</p>
<p>Soc. In the first place, there would be an absurdity in assuming</p>
<p>that he who asked the question would understand from our answer the</p>
<p>nature of &quot;clay,&quot; merely because we added &quot;of the image-makers,&quot; or of</p>
<p>any other workers. How can a man understand the name of anything, when</p>
<p>he does not know the nature of it?</p>
<p>Theaet. He cannot.</p>
<p>Soc. Then he who does not know what science or knowledge is, has</p>
<p>no knowledge of the art or science of making shoes?</p>
<p>Theaet. None.</p>
<p>Soc. Nor of any other science?</p>
<p>Theaet. No.</p>
<p>Soc. And when a man is asked what science or knowledge is, to give</p>
<p>in answer the name of some art or science is ridiculous; for the</p>
<p>-question is, &quot;What is knowledge?&quot; and he replies, &quot;A knowledge of</p>
<p>this or that.&quot;</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Moreover, he might answer shortly and simply, but he makes an</p>
<p>enormous circuit. For example, when asked about the day, he might have</p>
<p>said simply, that clay is moistened earth-what sort of clay is not</p>
<p>to the point.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, Socrates, there is no difficulty as you put the</p>
<p>question. You mean, if I am not mistaken, something like what occurred</p>
<p>to me and to my friend here, your namesake Socrates, in a recent</p>
<p>discussion.</p>
<p>Soc. What was that, Theaetetus?</p>
<p>Theaet. Theodorus was writing out for us something about roots, such</p>
<p>as the roots of three or five, showing that they are incommensurable</p>
<p>by the unit: he selected other examples up to seventeen-there he</p>
<p>stopped. Now as there are innumerable roots, the notion occurred to us</p>
<p>of attempting to include them all under one name or class.</p>
<p>Soc. And did you find such a class?</p>
<p>Theaet. I think that we did; but I should like to have your opinion.</p>
<p>Soc. Let me hear.</p>
<p>Theaet. We divided all numbers into two classes: those which are</p>
<p>made up of equal factors multiplying into one another, which we</p>
<p>compared to square figures and called square or equilateral</p>
<p>numbers;-that was one class.</p>
<p>Soc. Very good.</p>
<p>Theaet. The intermediate numbers, such as three and five, and</p>
<p>every other number which is made up of unequal factors, either of a</p>
<p>greater multiplied by a less, or of a less multiplied by a greater,</p>
<p>and when regarded as a figure, is contained in unequal sides;-all</p>
<p>these we compared to oblong figures, and called them oblong numbers.</p>
<p>Soc. Capital; and what followed?</p>
<p>Theaet. The lines, or sides, which have for their squares the</p>
<p>equilateral plane numbers, were called by us lengths or magnitudes;</p>
<p>and the lines which are the roots of (or whose squares are equal to)</p>
<p>the oblong numbers, were called powers or roots; the reason of this</p>
<p>latter name being, that they are commensurable with the former</p>
<p>[i.e., with the so-called lengths or magnitudes] not in linear</p>
<p>measurement, but in the value of the superficial content of their</p>
<p>squares; and the same about solids.</p>
<p>Soc. Excellent, my boys; I think that you fully justify the</p>
<p>praises of Theodorus, and that he will not be found guilty of false</p>
<p>witness.</p>
<p>Theaet. But I am unable, Socrates, to give you a similar answer</p>
<p>about knowledge, which is what you appear to want; and therefore</p>
<p>Theodorus is a deceiver after all.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, but if some one were to praise you for running, and to</p>
<p>say that he never met your equal among boys, and afterwards you were</p>
<p>beaten in a race by a grown-up man, who was a great runner-would the</p>
<p>praise be any the less true?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. And is the discovery of the nature of knowledge so small a</p>
<p>matter, as just now said? Is it not one which would task the powers of</p>
<p>men perfect in every way?</p>
<p>Theaet. By heaven, they should be the top of all perfection!</p>
<p>Soc. Well, then, be of good cheer; do not say that Theodorus was</p>
<p>mistaken about you, but do your best to ascertain the true nature of</p>
<p>knowledge, as well as of other things.</p>
<p>Theaet. I am eager enough, Socrates, if that would bring to light</p>
<p>the truth.</p>
<p>Soc. Come, you made a good beginning just now; let your own answer</p>
<p>about roots be your model, and as you comprehended them all in one</p>
<p>class, try and bring the many sorts of knowledge under one definition.</p>
<p>Theaet. I can assure you, Socrates, that I have tried very often,</p>
<p>when the report of questions asked by you was brought to me; but I can</p>
<p>neither persuade myself that I have a satisfactory answer to give, nor</p>
<p>hear of any one who answers as you would have him; and I cannot</p>
<p>shake off a feeling of anxiety.</p>
<p>Soc. These are the pangs of labour, my dear Theaetetus; you have</p>
<p>something within you which you are bringing to the birth.</p>
<p>Theaet. I do not know, Socrates; I only say what I feel.</p>
<p>Soc. And have you never heard, simpleton, that I am the son of a</p>
<p>midwife, brave and burly, whose name was Phaenarete?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, I have.</p>
<p>Soc. And that I myself practise midwifery?</p>
<p>Theaet. No, never.</p>
<p>Soc. Let me tell you that I do though, my friend: but you must not</p>
<p>reveal the secret, as the world in general have not found me out;</p>
<p>and therefore they only say of me, that I am the strangest of</p>
<p>mortals and drive men to their wits&#x27; end. Did you ever hear that too?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Shall I tell you the reason?</p>
<p>Theaet. By all means.</p>
<p>Soc. Bear in mind the whole business of the mid-wives, and then</p>
<p>you will see my meaning better:-No woman, as you are probably aware,</p>
<p>who is still able to conceive and bear, attends other women, but</p>
<p>only those who are past bearing.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes; I know.</p>
<p>Soc. The reason of this is said to be that Artemis-the goddess of</p>
<p>childbirth-is not a mother, and she honours those who are like</p>
<p>herself; but she could not allow the barren to be mid-wives, because</p>
<p>human nature cannot know the mystery of an art without experience; and</p>
<p>therefore she assigned this office to those who are too old to bear.</p>
<p>Theaet. I dare say.</p>
<p>Soc. And I dare say too, or rather I am absolutely certain, that the</p>
<p>mid-wives know better than others who is pregnant and who is not?</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. And by the use of potions and incantations they are able to</p>
<p>arouse the pangs and to soothe them at will; they can make those</p>
<p>bear who have a difficulty in bearing, and if they think fit they</p>
<p>can smother the embryo in the womb.</p>
<p>Theaet. They can.</p>
<p>Soc. Did you ever remark that they are also most cunning</p>
<p>matchmakers, and have a thorough knowledge of what unions are likely</p>
<p>to produce a brave brood?</p>
<p>Theaet. No, never.</p>
<p>Soc. Then let me tell you that this is their greatest pride, more</p>
<p>than cutting the umbilical cord. And if you reflect, you will see that</p>
<p>the same art which cultivates and gathers in the fruits of the</p>
<p>earth, will be most likely to know in what soils the several plants or</p>
<p>seeds should be deposited.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, the same art.</p>
<p>Soc. And do you suppose that with women the case is otherwise?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should think not.</p>
<p>Soc. Certainly not; but mid-wives are respectable women who have a</p>
<p>character to lose, and they avoid this department of their profession,</p>
<p>because they are afraid of being called procuresses, which is a name</p>
<p>given to those who join together man and woman in an unlawful and</p>
<p>unscientific way; and yet the true midwife is also the true and only</p>
<p>matchmaker.</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. Such are the mid-wives, whose task is a very important one</p>
<p>but not so important as mine; for women do not bring into the world at</p>
<p>one time real children, and at another time counterfeits which are</p>
<p>with difficulty distinguished from them; if they did, then the,</p>
<p>discernment of the true and false birth would be the crowning</p>
<p>achievement of the art of midwifery-you would think so?</p>
<p>Theaet. Indeed I should.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, my art of midwifery is in most respects like theirs;</p>
<p>but differs, in that I attend men and not women; and look after</p>
<p>their souls when they are in labour, and not after their bodies: and</p>
<p>the triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought</p>
<p>which the mind of the young man brings forth is a false idol or a</p>
<p>noble and true birth. And like the mid-wives, I am barren, and the</p>
<p>reproach which is often made against me, that I ask questions of</p>
<p>others and have not the wit to answer them myself, is very just-the</p>
<p>reason is, that the god compels-me to be a midwife, but does not allow</p>
<p>me to bring forth. And therefore I am not myself at all wise, nor have</p>
<p>I anything to show which is the invention or birth of my own soul, but</p>
<p>those who converse with me profit. Some of them appear dull enough</p>
<p>at first, but afterwards, as our acquaintance ripens, if the god is</p>
<p>gracious to them, they all make astonishing progress; and this in</p>
<p>the opinion of others as well as in their own. It is quite dear that</p>
<p>they never learned anything from me; the many fine discoveries to</p>
<p>which they cling are of their own making. But to me and the god they</p>
<p>owe their delivery. And the proof of my words is, that many of them in</p>
<p>their ignorance, either in their self-conceit despising me, or falling</p>
<p>under the influence of others, have gone away too soon; and have not</p>
<p>only lost the children of whom I had previously delivered them by an</p>
<p>ill bringing up, but have stifled whatever else they had in them by</p>
<p>evil communications, being fonder of lies and shams than of the truth;</p>
<p>and they have at last ended by seeing themselves, as others see</p>
<p>them, to be great fools. Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus, is one</p>
<p>of them, and there are many others. The truants often return to me,</p>
<p>and beg that I would consort with them again-they are ready to go to</p>
<p>me on their knees and then, if my familiar allows, which is not always</p>
<p>the case, I receive them, and they begin to grow again. Dire are the</p>
<p>pangs which my art is able to arouse and to allay in those who consort</p>
<p>with me, just like the pangs of women in childbirth; night and day</p>
<p>they are full of perplexity and travail which is even worse than</p>
<p>that of the women. So much for them. And there are -others,</p>
<p>Theaetetus, who come to me apparently having nothing in them; and as I</p>
<p>know that they have no need of my art, I coax them into marrying</p>
<p>some one, and by the grace of God I can generally tell who is likely</p>
<p>to do them good. Many of them I have given away to Prodicus, and</p>
<p>many to other inspired sages. I tell you this long story, friend</p>
<p>Theaetetus, because I suspect, as indeed you seem to think yourself,</p>
<p>that you are in labour-great with some conception. Come then to me,</p>
<p>who am a midwife&#x27;s son and myself a midwife, and do your best to</p>
<p>answer the questions which I will ask you. And if I abstract and</p>
<p>expose your first-born, because I discover upon inspection that the</p>
<p>conception which you have formed is a vain shadow, do not quarrel with</p>
<p>me on that account, as the manner of women is when their first</p>
<p>children are taken from them. For I have actually known some who</p>
<p>were ready to bite me when I deprived them of a darling folly; they</p>
<p>did not perceive that I acted from good will, not knowing that no</p>
<p>god is the enemy of man-that was not within the range of their</p>
<p>ideas; neither am I their enemy in all this, but it would be wrong for</p>
<p>me to admit falsehood, or to stifle the truth. Once more, then,</p>
<p>Theaetetus, I repeat my old question, &quot;What is knowledge?&quot;-and do</p>
<p>not say that you cannot tell; but quit yourself like a man, and by the</p>
<p>help of God you will be able to tell.</p>
<p>Theaet. At any rate, Socrates, after such an exhortation I should be</p>
<p>ashamed of not trying to do my best. Now he who knows perceives what</p>
<p>he knows, and, as far as I can see at present, knowledge is</p>
<p>perception.</p>
<p>Soc. Bravely said, boy; that is the way in which you should</p>
<p>express your opinion. And now, let us examine together this conception</p>
<p>of yours, and see whether it is a true birth or a mere,</p>
<p>wind-egg:-You say that knowledge is perception?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, you have delivered yourself of a very important</p>
<p>doctrine about knowledge; it is indeed the opinion of Protagoras,</p>
<p>who has another way of expressing it, Man, he says, is the measure</p>
<p>of all things, of the existence of things that are, and of the</p>
<p>non-existence of things that are not:-You have read him?</p>
<p>Theaet. O yes, again and again.</p>
<p>Soc. Does he not say that things are to you such as they appear to</p>
<p>you, and to me such as they appear to me, and that you and I are men?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, he says so.</p>
<p>Soc. A wise man is not likely to talk nonsense. Let us try to</p>
<p>understand him: the same wind is blowing, and yet one of us may be</p>
<p>cold and the other not, or one may be slightly and the other very</p>
<p>cold?</p>
<p>Theaet. Quite true.</p>
<p>Soc. Now is the wind, regarded not in relation to us but absolutely,</p>
<p>cold or not; or are we to say, with Protagoras, that the wind is</p>
<p>cold to him who is cold, and not to him who is not?</p>
<p>Theaet. I suppose the last.</p>
<p>Soc. Then it must appear so to each of them?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And &quot;appears to him&quot; means the same as &quot;he perceives.&quot;</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Then appearing and perceiving coincide in the case of hot and</p>
<p>cold, and in similar instances; for things appear, or may be</p>
<p>supposed to be, to each one such as he perceives them?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Then perception is always of existence, and being the same as</p>
<p>knowledge is unerring?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. In the name of the Graces, what an almighty wise man Protagoras</p>
<p>must have been! He spoke these things in a parable to the common herd,</p>
<p>like you and me, but told the truth, his Truth, in secret to his own</p>
<p>disciples.</p>
<p>Theaet. What do you mean, Socrates?</p>
<p>Soc. I am about to speak of a high argument, in which all things are</p>
<p>said to be relative; you cannot rightly call anything by any name,</p>
<p>such as great or small, heavy or light, for the great will be small</p>
<p>and the heavy light-there is no single thing or quality, but out of</p>
<p>motion and change and admixture all things are becoming relatively</p>
<p>to one another, which &quot;becoming&quot; is by us incorrectly called being,</p>
<p>but is really becoming, for nothing ever is, but all things are</p>
<p>becoming. Summon all philosophers-Protagoras, Heracleitus, Empedocles,</p>
<p>and the rest of them, one after another, and with the exception of</p>
<p>Parmenides they will agree with you in this. Summon the great</p>
<p>masters of either kind of poetry-Epicharmus, the prince of Comedy, and</p>
<p>Homer of Tragedy; when the latter sings of</p>

<p>does he not mean that all things are the offspring, of flux and</p>
<p>motion?</p>
<p>Theaet. I think so.</p>
<p>Soc. And who could take up arms against such a great army having</p>
<p>Homer for its general, and not appear ridiculous?</p>
<p>Theaet. Who indeed, Socrates?</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, Theaetetus; and there are plenty of other proofs which</p>
<p>will show that motion is the source of what is called being and</p>
<p>becoming, and inactivity of not-being and destruction; for fire and</p>
<p>warmth, which are supposed to be the parent and guardian of all</p>
<p>other things, are born of movement and friction, which is a kind of</p>
<p>motion;-is not this the origin of fire?</p>
<p>Theaet. It is.</p>
<p>Soc. And the race of animals is generated in the same way?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And is not the bodily habit spoiled by rest and idleness, but</p>
<p>preserved for a long time by motion and exercise?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And what of the mental habit? Is not the soul informed, and</p>
<p>improved, and preserved by study and attention, which are motions; but</p>
<p>when at rest, which in the soul only means want of attention and</p>
<p>study, is uninformed, and speedily forgets whatever she has learned?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Then motion is a good, and rest an evil, to the soul as well as</p>
<p>to the body?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. I may add, that breathless calm, stillness and the like waste</p>
<p>and impair, while wind and storm preserve; and the palmary argument of</p>
<p>all, which I strongly urge, is the golden chain in Homer, by which</p>
<p>he means the sun, thereby indicating that so long as the sun and the</p>
<p>heavens go round in their orbits, all things human and divine are</p>
<p>and are preserved, but if they were chained up and their motions</p>
<p>ceased, then all things would be destroyed, and, as the saying is,</p>
<p>turned upside down.</p>
<p>Theaet. I believe, Socrates, that you have truly explained his</p>
<p>meaning.</p>
<p>Soc. Then now apply his doctrine to perception, my good friend,</p>
<p>and first of all to vision; that which you call white colour is not in</p>
<p>your eyes, and is not a distinct thing which exists out of them. And</p>
<p>you must not assign any place to it: for if it had position it would</p>
<p>be, and be at rest, and there would be no process of becoming.</p>
<p>Theaet. Then what is colour?</p>
<p>Soc. Let us carry the principle which has just been affirmed, that</p>
<p>nothing is self-existent, and then we shall see that white, black, and</p>
<p>every other colour, arises out of the eye meeting the appropriate</p>
<p>motion, and that what we call a colour is in each case neither the</p>
<p>active nor the passive element, but something which passes between</p>
<p>them, and is peculiar to each percipient; are you quite certain that</p>
<p>the several colours appear to a dog or to any animal whatever as</p>
<p>they appear to you?</p>
<p>Theaet. Far from it.</p>
<p>Soc. Or that anything appears the same to you as to another man? Are</p>
<p>you so profoundly convinced of this? Rather would it not be true</p>
<p>that it never appears exactly the same to you, because you are never</p>
<p>exactly the same?</p>
<p>Theaet. The latter.</p>
<p>Soc. And if that with which I compare myself in size, or which I</p>
<p>apprehend by touch, were great or white or hot, it could not become</p>
<p>different by mere contact with another unless it actually changed; nor</p>
<p>again, if the comparing or apprehending subject were great or white or</p>
<p>hot, could this, when unchanged from within become changed by any</p>
<p>approximation or affection of any other thing. The fact is that in our</p>
<p>ordinary way of speaking we allow ourselves to be driven into most</p>
<p>ridiculous and wonderful contradictions, as Protagoras and all who</p>
<p>take his line of argument would remark.</p>
<p>Theaet. How? and of what sort do you mean?</p>
<p>Soc. A little instance will sufficiently explain my meaning: Here</p>
<p>are six dice, which are more by a half when compared with four, and</p>
<p>fewer by a half than twelve-they are more and also fewer. How can</p>
<p>you or any one maintain the contrary?</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, then, suppose that Protagoras or some one asks whether</p>
<p>anything can become greater or more if not by increasing, how would</p>
<p>you answer him, Theaetetus?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should say &quot;No,&quot; Socrates, if I were to speak my mind in</p>
<p>reference to this last question, and if I were not afraid of</p>
<p>contradicting my former answer.</p>
<p>Soc. Capital excellent! spoken like an oracle, my boy! And if you</p>
<p>reply &quot;Yes,&quot; there will be a case for Euripides; for our tongue will</p>
<p>be unconvinced, but not our mind.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. The thoroughbred Sophists, who know all that can be known about</p>
<p>the mind, and argue only out of the superfluity of their wits, would</p>
<p>have had a regular sparring-match over this, and would -have knocked</p>
<p>their arguments together finely. But you and I, who have no</p>
<p>professional aims, only desire to see what is the mutual relation of</p>
<p>these principles-whether they are consistent with each or not.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, that would be my desire.</p>
<p>Soc. And mine too. But since this is our feeling, and there is</p>
<p>plenty of time, why should we not calmly and patiently review our</p>
<p>own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in</p>
<p>us really are? If I am not mistaken, they will be described by us as</p>
<p>follows:-first, that nothing can become greater or less, either in</p>
<p>number or magnitude, while remaining equal to itself-you would agree?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Secondly, that without addition or subtraction there is no</p>
<p>increase or diminution of anything, but only equality.</p>
<p>Theaet. Quite true.</p>
<p>Soc. Thirdly, that what was not before cannot be afterwards, without</p>
<p>becoming and having become.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, truly.</p>
<p>Soc. These three axioms, if I am not mistaken, are fighting with one</p>
<p>another in our minds in the case of the dice, or, again, in such a</p>
<p>case as this-if I were to say that I, who am of a certain height and</p>
<p>taller than you, may within a year, without gaining or losing in</p>
<p>height, be not so tall-not that I should have lost, but that you would</p>
<p>have increased. In such a case, I am afterwards what I once was not,</p>
<p>and yet I have not become; for I could not have become without</p>
<p>becoming, neither could I have become less without losing somewhat</p>
<p>of my height; and I could give you ten thousand examples of similar</p>
<p>contradictions, if we admit them at all. I believe that you follow me,</p>
<p>Theaetetus; for I suspect that you have thought of these questions</p>
<p>before now.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, Socrates, and I am amazed when I think of them; by</p>
<p>the Gods I am! and I want to know what on earth they mean; and there</p>
<p>are times when my head quite swims with the contemplation of them.</p>
<p>Soc. I see, my dear Theaetetus, that Theodorus had a true insight</p>
<p>into your nature when he said that you were a philosopher, for</p>
<p>wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in</p>
<p>wonder. He was not a bad genealogist who said that Iris (the messenger</p>
<p>of heaven) is the child of Thaumas (wonder). But do you begin to see</p>
<p>what is the explanation of this perplexity on the hypothesis which</p>
<p>we attribute to Protagoras?</p>
<p>Theaet. Not as yet.</p>
<p>Soc. Then you will be obliged to me if I help you to unearth the</p>
<p>hidden &quot;truth&quot; of a famous man or school.</p>
<p>Theaet. To be sure, I shall be very much obliged.</p>
<p>Soc. Take a look round, then, and see that none of the uninitiated</p>
<p>are listening. Now by the uninitiated I mean: the people who believe</p>
<p>in nothing but what they can grasp in their hands, and who will not</p>
<p>allow that action or generation or anything invisible can have real</p>
<p>existence.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, indeed, Socrates, they are very hard and impenetrable</p>
<p>mortals.</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, my boy, outer barbarians. Far more ingenious are the</p>
<p>brethren whose mysteries I am about to reveal to you. Their first</p>
<p>principle is, that all is motion, and upon this all the affections</p>
<p>of which we were just now speaking, are supposed to depend: there is</p>
<p>nothing but motion, which has two forms, one active and the other</p>
<p>passive, both in endless number; and out of the union and friction</p>
<p>of them there is generated a progeny endless in number, having two</p>
<p>forms, sense and the object of sense, which are ever breaking forth</p>
<p>and coming to the birth at the same moment. The senses are variously</p>
<p>named hearing, seeing, smelling; there is the sense of heat, cold,</p>
<p>pleasure, pain, desire, fear, and many more which have names, as</p>
<p>well as innumerable others which are without them; each has its</p>
<p>kindred object each variety of colour has a corresponding variety of</p>
<p>sight, and so with sound and hearing, and with the rest of the</p>
<p>senses and the objects akin to them. Do you see, Theaetetus, the</p>
<p>bearings of this tale on the preceding argument?</p>
<p>Theaet. Indeed I do not.</p>
<p>Soc. Then attend, and I will try to finish the story. The purport is</p>
<p>that all these things are in motion, as I was saying, and that this</p>
<p>motion is of two kinds, a slower and a quicker; and the slower</p>
<p>elements have their motions in the same place and with reference to</p>
<p>things near them, and so they beget; but what is begotten is</p>
<p>swifter, for it is carried to fro, and moves from place to place.</p>
<p>Apply this to sense:-When the eye and the appropriate object meet</p>
<p>together and give birth to whiteness and the sensation connatural with</p>
<p>it, which could not have been given by either of them going elsewhere,</p>
<p>then, while the sight: is flowing from the eye, whiteness proceeds</p>
<p>from the object which combines in producing the colour; and so the eye</p>
<p>is fulfilled with sight, and really sees, and becomes, not sight,</p>
<p>but a seeing eye; and the object which combined to form the colour</p>
<p>is fulfilled with whiteness, and becomes not whiteness but a white</p>
<p>thing, whether wood or stone or whatever the object may be which</p>
<p>happens to be colour,ed white. And this is true of all sensible</p>
<p>objects, hard, warm, and the like, which are similarly to be regarded,</p>
<p>as I was saying before, not as having any absolute existence, but as</p>
<p>being all of them of whatever kind. generated by motion in their</p>
<p>intercourse with one another; for of the agent and patient, as</p>
<p>existing in separation, no trustworthy conception, as they say, can be</p>
<p>formed, for the agent has no existence until united; with the patient,</p>
<p>and the patient has no existence until united with the agent; and that</p>
<p>which by uniting with something becomes an agent, by meeting with some</p>
<p>other thing is converted into a patient. And from all these</p>
<p>considerations, as I said at first, there arises a general reflection,</p>
<p>that there is no one self-existent thing, but everything is becoming</p>
<p>and in relation; and being must be altogether abolished, although from</p>
<p>habit and ignorance we are compelled even in this discussion to retain</p>
<p>the use of the term. But great philosophers tell us that we are not to</p>
<p>allow either the word &quot;something,&quot; or &quot;belonging to something,&quot; or &quot;to</p>
<p>me,&quot; or &quot;this,&quot; or &quot;that,&quot; or any other detaining name to be used,</p>
<p>in the language of nature all things are being created and</p>
<p>destroyed, coming into being and passing into new forms; nor can any</p>
<p>name fix or detain them; he who attempts to fix them is easily</p>
<p>refuted. And this should be the way of speaking, not only of</p>
<p>particulars but of aggregates such aggregates as are expressed in</p>
<p>the word &quot;man,&quot; or &quot;stone,&quot; or any name of animal or of a class. O</p>
<p>Theaetetus, are not these speculations sweet as honey? And do you</p>
<p>not like the taste of them in the mouth?</p>
<p>Theaet. I do not know what to say, Socrates, for, indeed, I cannot</p>
<p>make out whether you are giving your own opinion or only wanting to</p>
<p>draw me out.</p>
<p>Soc. You forget, my friend, that I neither know, nor profess to</p>
<p>know, anything of! these matters; you are the person who is in labour,</p>
<p>I am the barren midwife; and this is why I soothe you, and offer you</p>
<p>one good thing after another, that you may taste them. And I hope that</p>
<p>I may at last help to bring your own opinion into the light of day:</p>
<p>when this has been accomplished, then we will determine whether what</p>
<p>you have brought forth is only a wind-egg or a real and genuine birth.</p>
<p>Therefore, keep up your spirits, and answer like a man what you think.</p>
<p>Theaet. Ask me.</p>
<p>Soc. Then once more: Is it your opinion that nothing is but what</p>
<p>becomes? the good and the noble, as well; as all the other things</p>
<p>which we were just now mentioning?</p>
<p>Theaet. When I hear you discoursing in this style, I think that</p>
<p>there is a great deal in what you say, and I am very ready to</p>
<p>assent. Soc. Let us not leave the argument unfinished, then; for there</p>
<p>still remains to be considered an objection which may be raised</p>
<p>about dreams and diseases, in particular about madness, and the</p>
<p>various illusions of hearing and sight, or of other senses. For you</p>
<p>know that in all these cases the esse-percipi theory appears to be</p>
<p>unmistakably refuted, since in dreams and illusions we certainly</p>
<p>have false perceptions; and far from saying that everything is which</p>
<p>appears, we should rather say that nothing is which appears.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. But then, my boy, how can any one contend that knowledge is</p>
<p>perception, or that to every man what appears is?</p>
<p>Theaet. I am afraid to say, Socrates, that I have nothing to answer,</p>
<p>because you rebuked me just now for making this excuse; but I</p>
<p>certainly cannot undertake to argue that madmen or dreamers think</p>
<p>truly, when they imagine, some of them that they are gods, and</p>
<p>others that they can fly, and are flying in their sleep.</p>
<p>Soc. Do you see another question which can be raised about these</p>
<p>phenomena, notably about dreaming and waking?</p>
<p>Theaet. What question?</p>
<p>Soc. A question which I think that you must often have heard persons</p>
<p>ask:-How can you determine whether at this moment we are sleeping, and</p>
<p>all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, and talking</p>
<p>to one another in the waking state?</p>
<p>Theaet. Indeed, Socrates, I do not know how to prove the one any</p>
<p>more than the other, for in both cases the facts precisely</p>
<p>correspond;-and there is no difficulty in supposing that during all</p>
<p>this discussion we have been talking to one another in a dream; and</p>
<p>when in a dream we seem to be narrating dreams, the resemblance of the</p>
<p>two states is quite astonishing.</p>
<p>Soc. You see, then, that a doubt about the reality of sense is</p>
<p>easily raised, since there may even be a doubt whether we are awake or</p>
<p>in a dream. And as our time is equally divided between sleeping and</p>
<p>waking, in either sphere of existence the soul contends that the</p>
<p>thoughts which are present to our minds at the time are true; and</p>
<p>during one half of our lives we affirm the truth of the one, and,</p>
<p>during the other half, of the other; and are equally confident of</p>
<p>both.</p>
<p>Theaet. Most true.</p>
<p>Soc. And may not the same be said of madness and other disorders?</p>
<p>the difference is only that the times are not equal.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And is truth or falsehood to be determined by duration of time?</p>
<p>Theaet. That would be in many ways ridiculous.</p>
<p>Soc. But can you certainly determine: by any other means which of</p>
<p>these opinions is true?</p>
<p>Theaet. I do not think that I can.</p>
<p>Soc. Listen, then to a statement of the other side of the</p>
<p>argument, which is made by the champions of appearance. They would</p>
<p>say, as I imagine-can that which is wholly other than something,</p>
<p>have the same quality as that from which it differs? and observe,</p>
<p>-Theaetetus, that the word &quot;other&quot; means not &quot;partially,&quot; but</p>
<p>&quot;wholly other.&quot;</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly, putting the question as you do, that which is</p>
<p>wholly other cannot either potentially or in any other way be the</p>
<p>same.</p>
<p>Soc. And must therefore be admitted to be unlike?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. If, then, anything happens to become like or unlike itself or</p>
<p>another, when it becomes like we call it the same-when unlike, other?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Were we not saying that there. are agents many and infinite,</p>
<p>and patients many and infinite?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And also that different combinations will produce results which</p>
<p>are not the same, but different?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Let us take you and me, or anything as an example:-There is</p>
<p>Socrates in health, and Socrates sick-Are they like or unlike?</p>
<p>Theaet. You mean to, compare Socrates in health as a whole, and</p>
<p>Socrates in sickness as a whole?</p>
<p>Soc. Exactly; that is my meaning.</p>
<p>Theaet. I answer, they are unlike.</p>
<p>Soc. And if unlike, they are other?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And would you not say the same of Socrates sleeping and waking,</p>
<p>or in any of the states which we were mentioning?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should.</p>
<p>Soc. All agents have a different patient in Socrates, accordingly as</p>
<p>he is well or ill.</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course.</p>
<p>Soc. And I who am the patient, and that which is the agent, will</p>
<p>produce something different in each of the two cases?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. The wine which I drink when I am in health, appears sweet and</p>
<p>pleasant to me?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. For, as has been already acknowledged, the patient and agent</p>
<p>meet together and produce sweetness and a perception of sweetness,</p>
<p>which are in simultaneous motion, and the perception which comes</p>
<p>from the patient makes the tongue percipient, and the quality of</p>
<p>sweetness which arises out of and is moving about the wine, makes</p>
<p>the wine, both to be and to appear sweet to the healthy tongue.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly; that has been already acknowledged.</p>
<p>Soc. But when I am sick, the wine really acts upon another and a</p>
<p>different person?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. The combination of the draught of wine, and the Socrates who is</p>
<p>sick, produces quite another result; which is the sensation of</p>
<p>bitterness in the tongue, and the, motion and creation of bitterness</p>
<p>in and about the wine, which becomes not bitterness but something</p>
<p>bitter; as I myself become not but percipient?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. There is no, other object of which I shall ever have the same</p>
<p>perception, for another object would give another perception, and</p>
<p>would make the perception other and different; nor can that object</p>
<p>which affects me, meeting another, subject, produce, the same, or</p>
<p>become similar, for that too would produce another result from another</p>
<p>subject, and become different.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Neither can by myself, have this sensation, nor the object by</p>
<p>itself, this quality.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. When I perceive I must become percipient of something-there can</p>
<p>be no such thing as perceiving and perceiving nothing; the object,</p>
<p>whether it become sweet, bitter, or of any other quality, must have</p>
<p>relation to a percipient; nothing can become sweet which is sweet to</p>
<p>no one.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. Then the inference is, that we [the agent and patient] are or</p>
<p>become in relation to one another; there is a law which binds us one</p>
<p>to the other, but not to any other existence, nor each of us to</p>
<p>himself; and therefore we can only be bound to one another; so that</p>
<p>whether a person says that a thing is or becomes, he must say that</p>
<p>it is or becomes to or of or in relation to something else; but he</p>
<p>must not say or allow any one else to say that anything is or</p>
<p>becomes absolutely: -such is our conclusion.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. Then, if that which acts upon me has relation to me and to no</p>
<p>other, I and no other am the percipient of it?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course.</p>
<p>Soc. Then my perception is true to me, being inseparable from my own</p>
<p>being; and, as Protagoras says, to myself I am judge of what is</p>
<p>and-what is not to me.</p>
<p>Theaet. I suppose so.</p>
<p>Soc. How then, if I never err, and if my mind never trips in the</p>
<p>conception of being or becoming, can I fail of knowing that which I</p>
<p>perceive?</p>
<p>Theaet. You cannot.</p>
<p>Soc. Then you were quite right in affirming that knowledge is only</p>
<p>perception; and the meaning turns out to be the same, whether with</p>
<p>Homer and Heracleitus, and all that company, you say that all is</p>
<p>motion and flux, or with the great sage Protagoras, that man is the</p>
<p>measure of all things; or with Theaetetus, that, given these premises,</p>
<p>perception is knowledge. Am I not right, Theaetetus, and is not this</p>
<p>your newborn child, of which I have delivered you? What say you?</p>
<p>Theaet. I cannot but agree, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. Then this is the child, however he may turn out, which you</p>
<p>and I have with difficulty brought into the world. And now that he</p>
<p>is born, we must run round the hearth with him, and see whether he</p>
<p>is worth rearing, or is only a wind-egg and a sham. Is he to be reared</p>
<p>in any case, and not exposed? or will you bear to see him rejected,</p>
<p>and not get into a passion if I take away your first-born?</p>
<p>Theod. Theaetetus will not be angry, for he is very good-natured.</p>
<p>But tell me, Socrates, in heaven&#x27;s name, is this, after all, not the</p>
<p>truth?</p>
<p>Soc. You, Theodorus, are a lover of theories, and now you innocently</p>
<p>fancy that I am a bag full of them, and can easily pull one out</p>
<p>which will overthrow its predecessor. But you do not see that in</p>
<p>reality none of these theories come from me; they all come from him</p>
<p>who talks with me. I only know just enough to extract them from the</p>
<p>wisdom of another, and to receive them in a spirit of fairness. And</p>
<p>now I shall say nothing myself, but shall endeavour to elicit</p>
<p>something from our young friend.</p>
<p>Theod. Do as you say, Socrates; you are quite right.</p>
<p>Soc. Shall I tell you, Theodorus, what amazes me in your</p>
<p>acquaintance Protagoras?</p>
<p>Theod. What is it?</p>
<p>Soc. I am charmed with his doctrine, that what appears is to each</p>
<p>one, but I wonder that he did not begin his book on Truth with a</p>
<p>declaration that a pig or a dog-faced baboon, or some other yet</p>
<p>stranger monster which has sensation, is the measure of all things;</p>
<p>then he might have shown a magnificent contempt for our opinion of him</p>
<p>by informing us at the outset that while we were reverencing him</p>
<p>like a God for his wisdom he was no better than a tadpole, not to</p>
<p>speak of his fellow-men-would not this have produced an</p>
<p>over-powering effect? For if truth is only sensation, and no man can</p>
<p>discern another&#x27;s feelings better than he, or has any superior right</p>
<p>to determine whether his opinion is true or false, but each, as we</p>
<p>have several times repeated, is to himself the sole judge, and</p>
<p>everything that he judges is true and right, why, my friend, should</p>
<p>Protagoras be preferred to the place of wisdom and instruction, and</p>
<p>deserve to be well paid, and we poor ignoramuses have to go to him, if</p>
<p>each one is the measure of his own wisdom? Must he not be talking ad</p>
<p>captandum in all this? I say nothing of the ridiculous predicament</p>
<p>in which my own midwifery and the whole art of dialectic is placed;</p>
<p>for the attempt to supervise or refute the notions or opinions of</p>
<p>others would be a tedious and enormous piece of folly, if to each</p>
<p>man his own are right; and this must be the case if Protagoras Truth</p>
<p>is the real truth, and the philosopher is not merely amusing himself</p>
<p>by giving oracles out of the shrine of his book.</p>
<p>Theod. He was a friend of mine, Socrates, as you were saying, and</p>
<p>therefore I cannot have him refuted by my lips, nor can I oppose you</p>
<p>when I agree with you; please, then, to take Theaetetus again; he</p>
<p>seemed to answer very nicely.</p>
<p>Soc. If you were to go into a Lacedaemonian palestra, Theodorus,</p>
<p>would you have a right to look on at the naked wrestlers, some of them</p>
<p>making a poor figure, if you did not strip and give them an</p>
<p>opportunity of judging of your own person?</p>
<p>Theod. Why not, Socrates, if they would allow me, as I think you</p>
<p>will in consideration of my age and stiffness; let some more supple</p>
<p>youth try a fall with you, and do not drag me into the gymnasium.</p>
<p>Soc. Your will is my will, Theodorus, as the proverbial philosophers</p>
<p>say, and therefore I will return to the sage Theaetetus: Tell me,</p>
<p>Theaetetus, in reference to what I was saying, are you not lost in</p>
<p>wonder, like myself, when you find that all of a sudden you are raised</p>
<p>to the level of the wisest of men, or indeed of the gods?-for you</p>
<p>would assume the measure of Protagoras to apply to the gods as well as</p>
<p>men?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly I should, and I confess to you that I am lost in</p>
<p>wonder. At first hearing, I was quite satisfied with the doctrine,</p>
<p>that whatever appears is to each one, but now the face of things has</p>
<p>changed.</p>
<p>Soc. Why, my dear boy, you are young, and therefore your ear is</p>
<p>quickly caught and your mind influenced by popular arguments.</p>
<p>Protagoras, or some one speaking on his behalf, will doubtless say</p>
<p>in reply, good people, young and old, you meet and harangue, and bring</p>
<p>in the gods, whose existence of non-existence I banish from writing</p>
<p>and speech, or you talk about the reason of man being degraded to</p>
<p>the level of the brutes, which is a telling argument with the</p>
<p>multitude, but not one word of proof or demonstration do you offer.</p>
<p>All is probability with you, and yet surely you and Theodorus had</p>
<p>better reflect whether you are disposed to admit of probability and</p>
<p>figures of speech in matters of such importance. He or any other</p>
<p>mathematician who argued from probabilities and likelihoods in</p>
<p>geometry, would not be worth an ace.</p>
<p>Theaet. But neither you nor we, Socrates, would be satisfied with</p>
<p>such arguments.</p>
<p>Soc. Then you and Theodorus mean to say that we must look at the</p>
<p>matter in some other way?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, in quite another way.</p>
<p>Soc. And the way will be to ask whether perception is or is not</p>
<p>the same as knowledge; for this was the real point of our argument,</p>
<p>and with a view to this we raised (did we not?) those many strange</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Shall we say that we know every thing which we see and hear?</p>
<p>for example, shall we say that not having learned, we do not hear</p>
<p>the language of foreigners when they speak to us? or shall we say that</p>
<p>we not only hear, but know what they are saying? Or again, if we see</p>
<p>letters which we do not understand, shall we say that we do not see</p>
<p>them? or shall we aver that, seeing them, we must know them?</p>
<p>Theaet. We shall say, Socrates, that we know what we actually see</p>
<p>and hear of them-that is to say, we see and know the figure and colour</p>
<p>of the letters, and we hear and know the elevation or depression of</p>
<p>the sound of them; but we do not perceive by sight and hearing, or</p>
<p>know, that which grammarians and interpreters teach about them.</p>
<p>Soc. Capital, Theaetetus; and about this there shall be no</p>
<p>dispute, because I want you to grow; but there is another difficulty</p>
<p>coming, which you will also have to repulse.</p>
<p>Theaet. What is it?</p>
<p>Soc. Some one will say, Can a man who has ever known anything, and</p>
<p>still has and preserves a memory of that which he knows, not know that</p>
<p>which he remembers at the time when he remembers? I have, I fear, a</p>
<p>tedious way of putting a simple question, which is only, whether a man</p>
<p>who has learned, and remembers, can fail to know?</p>
<p>Theaet. Impossible, Socrates; the supposition is monstrous.</p>
<p>Soc. Am I talking nonsense, then? Think: is not seeing perceiving,</p>
<p>and is not sight perception?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And if our recent definition holds, every man knows that</p>
<p>which he has seen?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And you would admit that there is such a thing as memory?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And is memory of something or of nothing?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of something, surely.</p>
<p>Soc. Of things learned and perceived, that is?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Often a man remembers that which he has seen?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And if he closed his eyes, would he forget?</p>
<p>Theaet. Who, Socrates, would dare to say so?</p>
<p>Soc. But we must say so, if the previous argument is to be</p>
<p>maintained.</p>
<p>Theaet. What do you mean? I am not quite sure that I understand you,</p>
<p>though I have a strong suspicion that you are right.</p>
<p>Soc. As thus: he who sees knows, as we say, that which he sees;</p>
<p>for perception and sight and knowledge are admitted to be the same.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. But he who saw, and has knowledge of that which he saw,</p>
<p>remembers, when he closes his eyes, that which he no longer sees.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And seeing is knowing, and therefore not-seeing is not-knowing?</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. Then the inference is, that a man may have attained the</p>
<p>knowledge, of something, which he may remember and yet not know,</p>
<p>because he does not see; and this has been affirmed by us to be a</p>
<p>monstrous supposition.</p>
<p>Theaet. Most true.</p>
<p>Soc. Thus, then, the assertion that knowledge and perception are</p>
<p>one, involves a manifest impossibility?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Then they must be distinguished?</p>
<p>Theaet. I suppose that they must.</p>
<p>Soc. Once more we shall have to begin, and ask &quot;What is</p>
<p>knowledge?&quot; and yet, Theaetetus, what are we going to do?</p>
<p>Theaet. About what?</p>
<p>Soc. Like a good-for-nothing cock, without having won the victory,</p>
<p>we walk away from the argument and crow.</p>
<p>Theaet. How do you mean?</p>
<p>Soc. After the manner of disputers, we were satisfied with mere</p>
<p>verbal consistency, and were well pleased if in this way we could gain</p>
<p>an advantage. Although professing not to be mere Eristics, but</p>
<p>philosophers, I suspect that we have unconsciously fallen into the</p>
<p>error of that ingenious class of persons.</p>
<p>Theaet. I do not as yet understand you.</p>
<p>Soc. Then I will try to explain myself: just now we asked the</p>
<p>question, whether a man who had learned and remembered could fail to</p>
<p>know, and we showed that a person who had seen might remember when</p>
<p>he had his eyes shut and could not see, and then he would at the</p>
<p>same time remember and not know. But this was an impossibility. And so</p>
<p>the Protagorean fable came to nought, and yours also, who maintained</p>
<p>that knowledge is the same as perception.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And yet, my friend, I rather suspect that the result would have</p>
<p>been different if Protagoras, who was the father of the first of the</p>
<p>two-brats, had been alive; he would have had a great deal to say on</p>
<p>their behalf. But he is dead, and we insult over his orphan child; and</p>
<p>even the guardians whom he left, and of whom our friend Theodorus is</p>
<p>one, are unwilling to give any help, and therefore I suppose that must</p>
<p>take up his cause myself, and see justice done?</p>
<p>Theod. Not I, Socrates, but rather Callias, the son of Hipponicus,</p>
<p>is guardian of his orphans. I was too soon diverted from the</p>
<p>abstractions of dialectic to geometry. Nevertheless, I shall be</p>
<p>grateful to you if you assist him.</p>
<p>Soc. Very good, Theodorus; you shall see how I will come to the</p>
<p>rescue. If a person does not attend to the meaning of terms as they</p>
<p>are commonly used in argument, he may be involved even in greater</p>
<p>paradoxes than these. Shall I explain this matter to you or to</p>
<p>Theaetetus?</p>
<p>Theod. To both of us, and let the younger answer; he will incur less</p>
<p>disgrace if he is discomfited.</p>
<p>Soc. Then now let me ask the awful question, which is this:-Can a</p>
<p>man know and also not know that which he knows?</p>
<p>Theod. How shall we answer, Theaetetus?</p>
<p>Theaet. He cannot, I should say.</p>
<p>Soc. He can, if you maintain that seeing is knowing. When you are</p>
<p>imprisoned in a well, as the saying is, and the self-assured adversary</p>
<p>closes one of your eyes with his hand, and asks whether you can see</p>
<p>his cloak with the eye which he has closed, how will you answer the</p>
<p>inevitable man?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should answer, &quot;Not with that eye but with the other.&quot;</p>
<p>Soc. Then you see and do not see the same thing at the same time.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, in a certain sense.</p>
<p>Soc. None of that, he will reply; I do not ask or bid you answer</p>
<p>in what sense you know, but only whether you know that which you do</p>
<p>not know. You have been proved to see that which you do not see; and</p>
<p>you have already admitted that seeing is knowing, and that</p>
<p>not-seeing is not-knowing: I leave you to draw the inference.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, the inference is the contradictory of my assertion.</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, my marvel, and there might have been yet worse things in</p>
<p>store for you, if an opponent had gone on to ask whether you can</p>
<p>have a sharp and also a dull knowledge, and whether you can know near,</p>
<p>but not at a distance, or know the same thing with more or less</p>
<p>intensity, and so on without end. Such questions might have been put</p>
<p>to you by a light-armed mercenary, who argued for pay. He would have</p>
<p>lain in wait for you, and when you took up the position, that sense is</p>
<p>knowledge, he would have made an assault upon hearing, smelling, and</p>
<p>the other senses;-he would have shown you no mercy; and while you were</p>
<p>lost in envy and admiration of his wisdom, he would have got you</p>
<p>into his net, out of which you would not have escaped until you had</p>
<p>come to an understanding about the sum to be paid for your release.</p>
<p>Well, you ask, and how will Protagoras reinforce his position? Shall I</p>
<p>answer for him?</p>
<p>Theaet. By all means.</p>
<p>Soc. He will repeat all those things which we have been urging on</p>
<p>his behalf, and then he will close with us in disdain, and say:-The</p>
<p>worthy Socrates asked a little boy, whether the same man could</p>
<p>remember and not know the same thing, and the boy said No, because</p>
<p>he was frightened, and could not see what was coming, and then</p>
<p>Socrates made fun of poor me. The truth is, O slatternly Socrates,</p>
<p>that when you ask questions about any assertion of mine, and the</p>
<p>person asked is found tripping, if he has answered as I should have</p>
<p>answered, then I am refuted, but if he answers something else, then he</p>
<p>is refuted and not I. For do you really suppose that any one would</p>
<p>admit the memory which a man has of an impression which has passed</p>
<p>away to be the same with that which he experienced at the time?</p>
<p>Assuredly not. Or would he hesitate to acknowledge that the same man</p>
<p>may know and not know the same thing? Or, if he is afraid of making</p>
<p>this admission, would he ever grant that one who has become unlike</p>
<p>is the same as before he became unlike? Or would he admit that a man</p>
<p>is one at all, and not rather many and infinite as the changes which</p>
<p>take place in him? I speak by the card in order to avoid entanglements</p>
<p>of words. But, O my good sir, he would say, come to the argument in</p>
<p>a more generous spirit; and either show, if you can, that our</p>
<p>sensations are not relative and individual, or, if you admit them to</p>
<p>be so, prove that this does not involve the consequence that the</p>
<p>appearance becomes, or, if you will have the word, is, to the</p>
<p>individual only. As to your talk about pigs and baboons, you are</p>
<p>yourself behaving like a pig, and you teach your hearers to make sport</p>
<p>of my writings in the same ignorant manner; but this is not to your</p>
<p>credit. For I declare that the truth is as I have written, and that</p>
<p>each of us is a measure of existence and of non-existence. Yet one man</p>
<p>may be a thousand times better than another in proportion as different</p>
<p>things are and appear to him.</p>
<p>And I am far from saying that wisdom and the wise man have no</p>
<p>existence; but I say that the wise man is he who makes the evils which</p>
<p>appear and are to a man, into goods which are and appear to him. And I</p>
<p>would beg you not to my words in the letter, but to take the meaning</p>
<p>of them as I will explain them. Remember what has been already</p>
<p>said,-that to the sick man his food appears to be and is bitter, and</p>
<p>to the man in health the opposite of bitter. Now I cannot conceive</p>
<p>that one of these men can be or ought to be made wiser than the other:</p>
<p>nor can you assert that the sick man because he has one impression</p>
<p>is foolish, and the healthy man because he has another is wise; but</p>
<p>the one state requires to be changed into the other, the worse into</p>
<p>the better. As in education, a change of state has to be effected, and</p>
<p>the sophist accomplishes by words the change which the physician works</p>
<p>by the aid of drugs. Not that any one ever made another think truly,</p>
<p>who previously thought falsely. For no one can think what is not, or</p>
<p>think anything different from that which he feels; and this is</p>
<p>always true. But as the inferior habit of mind has thoughts of kindred</p>
<p>nature, so I conceive that a good mind causes men to have good</p>
<p>thoughts; and these which the inexperienced call true, I maintain to</p>
<p>be only better, and not truer than others. And, O my dear Socrates,</p>
<p>I do not call wise men tadpoles: far from it; I say that they are</p>
<p>the physicians of the human body, and the husbandmen of plants-for the</p>
<p>husbandmen also take away the evil and disordered sensations of</p>
<p>plants, and infuse into them good and healthy sensations-aye and</p>
<p>true ones; and the wise and good rhetoricians make the good instead of</p>
<p>the evil to seem just to states; for whatever appears to a state to be</p>
<p>just and fair, so long as it is regarded as such, is just and fair</p>
<p>to it; but the teacher of wisdom causes the good to take the place</p>
<p>of the evil, both in appearance and in reality. And in like manner the</p>
<p>Sophist who is able to train his pupils in this spirit is a wise</p>
<p>man, and deserves to be well paid by them. And so one man is wiser</p>
<p>than another; and no one thinks falsely, and you, whether you will</p>
<p>or not, must endure to be a measure. On these foundations the argument</p>
<p>stands firm, which you, Socrates, may, if you please, overthrow by</p>
<p>an opposite argument, or if you like you may put questions to me-a</p>
<p>method to which no intelligent person will object, quite the</p>
<p>reverse. But I must beg you to put fair questions: for there is</p>
<p>great inconsistency in saying that you have a zeal for virtue, and</p>
<p>then always behaving unfairly in argument. The unfairness of which I</p>
<p>complain is that you do not distinguish between mere disputation and</p>
<p>dialectic: the disputer may trip up his opponent as often as he likes,</p>
<p>and make fun; but the dialectician will be in earnest, and only</p>
<p>correct his adversary when necessary, telling him the errors into</p>
<p>which he has fallen through his own fault, or that of the company</p>
<p>which he has previously kept. If you do so, your adversary will lay</p>
<p>the blame of his own confusion and perplexity on himself, and not on</p>
<p>you; will follow and love you, and will hate himself, and escape</p>
<p>from himself into philosophy, in order that he may become different</p>
<p>from what he was. But the other mode of arguing, which is practised by</p>
<p>the many, will have just the opposite effect upon him; and as he grows</p>
<p>older, instead of turning philosopher, he will come to hate</p>
<p>philosophy. I would recommend you, therefore, as I said before, not to</p>
<p>encourage yourself in this polemical and controversial temper, but</p>
<p>to find out, in a friendly and congenial spirit, what we really mean</p>
<p>when we say that all things are in motion, and that to every</p>
<p>individual and state what appears, is. In this manner you will</p>
<p>consider whether knowledge and sensation are the same or different,</p>
<p>but you will not argue, as you were just now doing, from the customary</p>
<p>use of names and words, which the vulgar pervert in all sorts of ways,</p>
<p>causing infinite perplexity to one another. Such, Theodorus, is the</p>
<p>very slight help which I am able to offer to your old friend; had he</p>
<p>been living, he would have helped himself in a far more gloriose</p>
<p>style.</p>
<p>Theod. You are jesting, Socrates; indeed, your defence of him has</p>
<p>been most valorous.</p>
<p>Soc. Thank you, friend; and I hope that you observed Protagoras</p>
<p>bidding us be serious, as the text, &quot;Man is the measure of all</p>
<p>things,&quot; was a solemn one; and he reproached us with making a boy</p>
<p>the medium of discourse, and said that the boy&#x27;s timidity was made</p>
<p>to tell against his argument; he also declared that we made a joke</p>
<p>of him.</p>
<p>Theod. How could I fail to observe all that, Socrates?</p>
<p>Soc. Well, and shall we do as he says?</p>
<p>Theod. By all means.</p>
<p>Soc. But if his wishes are to be regarded, you and I must take up</p>
<p>the argument, and in all seriousness, and ask and answer one</p>
<p>another, for you see that the rest of us are nothing but boys. In no</p>
<p>other way can we escape the imputation, that in our fresh analysis</p>
<p>of his thesis we are making fun with boys.</p>
<p>Theod. Well, but is not Theaetetus better able to follow a</p>
<p>philosophical enquiry than a great many men who have long beards?</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, Theodorus, but not better than you; and therefore please</p>
<p>not to imagine that I am to defend by every means in my power your</p>
<p>departed friend; and that you are to defend nothing and nobody. At any</p>
<p>rate, my good man, do not sheer off until we know whether you are a</p>
<p>true measure of diagrams, or whether all men are equally measures</p>
<p>and sufficient for themselves in astronomy and geometry, and the other</p>
<p>branches of knowledge in which you are supposed to excel them.</p>
<p>Theod. He who is sitting by you, Socrates, will not easily avoid</p>
<p>being drawn into an argument; and when I said just now that you</p>
<p>would excuse me, and not, like the Lacedaemonians, compel me to</p>
<p>strip and fight, I was talking nonsense-I should rather compare you to</p>
<p>Scirrhon, who threw travellers from the rocks; for the Lacedaemonian</p>
<p>rule is &quot;strip or depart,&quot; but you seem to go about your work more</p>
<p>after the fashion of Antaeus: you will not allow any one who</p>
<p>approaches you to depart until you have stripped him, and he has</p>
<p>been compelled to try a fall with you in argument.</p>
<p>Soc. There, Theodorus, you have hit off precisely the nature of my</p>
<p>complaint; but I am even more pugnacious than the giants of old, for I</p>
<p>have met with no end of heroes; many a Heracles, many a Theseus,</p>
<p>mighty in words, has broken my head; nevertheless I am always at</p>
<p>this rough exercise, which inspires me like a passion. Please, then,</p>
<p>to try a fall with me, whereby you will do yourself good as well as</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Theod. I consent; lead me whither you will, for I know that you</p>
<p>are like destiny; no man can escape from any argument which you may</p>
<p>weave for him. But I am not disposed to go further than you suggest.</p>
<p>Soc. Once will be enough; and now take particular care that we do</p>
<p>not again unwittingly expose ourselves to the reproach of talking</p>
<p>childishly.</p>
<p>Theod. I will do my best to avoid that error.</p>
<p>Soc. In the first place, let us return to our old objection, and see</p>
<p>whether we were right in blaming and taking offence at Protagoras on</p>
<p>the ground that he assumed all to be equal and sufficient in wisdom;</p>
<p>although he admitted that there was a better and worse, and that in</p>
<p>respect of this, some who as he said were the wise excelled others.</p>
<p>Theod. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. Had Protagoras been living and answered for himself, instead of</p>
<p>our answering for him, there would have been no need of our</p>
<p>reviewing or reinforcing the argument. But as he is not here, and some</p>
<p>one may accuse us of speaking without authority on his behalf, had</p>
<p>we not better come to a clearer agreement about his meaning, for a</p>
<p>great deal may be at stake?</p>
<p>Theod. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Then let us obtain, not through any third person, but from</p>
<p>his own statement and in the fewest words possible, the basis of</p>
<p>agreement.</p>
<p>Theod. In what way?</p>
<p>Soc. In this way:-His words are, &quot;What seems to a man, is to him.&quot;</p>
<p>Theod. Yes, so he says.</p>
<p>Soc. And are not we, Protagoras, uttering the opinion of man, or</p>
<p>rather of all mankind, when we say that every one thinks himself wiser</p>
<p>than other men in some things, and their inferior in others? In the</p>
<p>hour of danger, when they are in perils of war, or of the sea, or of</p>
<p>sickness, do they not look up to their commanders as if they were</p>
<p>gods, and expect salvation from them, only because they excel them</p>
<p>in knowledge? Is not the world full of men in their several</p>
<p>employments, who are looking for teachers and rulers of themselves and</p>
<p>of the animals? and there are plenty who think that they are able to</p>
<p>teach and able to rule. Now, in all this is implied that ignorance and</p>
<p>wisdom exist among them, least in their own opinion.</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And wisdom is assumed by them to be true thought, and ignorance</p>
<p>to be false opinion.</p>
<p>Theod. Exactly.</p>
<p>Soc. How then, Protagoras, would you have us treat the argument?</p>
<p>Shall we say that the opinions of men are always true, or sometimes</p>
<p>true and sometimes false? In either case, the result is the same,</p>
<p>and their opinions are not always true, but sometimes true and</p>
<p>sometimes false. For tell me, Theodorus, do you suppose that you</p>
<p>yourself, or any other follower of Protagoras, would contend that no</p>
<p>one deems another ignorant or mistaken in his opinion?</p>
<p>Theod. The thing is incredible, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. And yet that absurdity is necessarily involved in the thesis</p>
<p>which declares man to be the measure of all things.</p>
<p>Theod. How so?</p>
<p>Soc. Why, suppose that you determine in your own mind something to</p>
<p>be true, and declare your opinion to me; let us assume, as he</p>
<p>argues, that this is true to you. Now, if so, you must either say that</p>
<p>the rest of us are not the judges of this opinion or judgment of</p>
<p>yours, or that we judge you always to have a true opinion: But are</p>
<p>there not thousands upon thousands who, whenever you form a</p>
<p>judgment, take up arms against you and are of an opposite judgment and</p>
<p>opinion, deeming that you judge falsely?</p>
<p>Theod. Yes, indeed, Socrates, thousands and tens of thousands, as</p>
<p>Homer says, who give me a world of trouble.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, but are we to assert that what you think is true to you</p>
<p>and false to the ten thousand others?</p>
<p>Theod. No other inference seems to be possible.</p>
<p>Soc. And how about Protagoras himself? If neither he nor the</p>
<p>multitude thought, as indeed they do not think, that man is the</p>
<p>measure of all things, must it not follow that the truth of which</p>
<p>Protagoras wrote would be true to no one? But if you suppose that he</p>
<p>himself thought this, and that the multitude does not agree with</p>
<p>him, you must begin by allowing that in whatever proportion the many</p>
<p>are more than one, in that proportion his truth is more untrue than</p>
<p>true.</p>
<p>Theod. That would follow if the truth is supposed to vary with</p>
<p>individual opinion.</p>
<p>Soc. And the best of the joke is, that he acknowledges the truth</p>
<p>of their opinion who believe his own opinion to be false; for he</p>
<p>admits that the opinions of all men are true.</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And does he not allow that his own opinion is false, if he</p>
<p>admits that the opinion of those who think him false is true?</p>
<p>Theod. Of course.</p>
<p>Soc. Whereas the other side do not admit that they speak falsely?</p>
<p>Theod. They do not.</p>
<p>Soc. And he, as may be inferred from his writings, agrees that</p>
<p>this opinion is also true.</p>
<p>Theod. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. Then all mankind, beginning with Protagoras, will contend, or</p>
<p>rather, I should say that he will allow, when he concedes that his</p>
<p>adversary has a true opinion-Protagoras, I say, will himself allow</p>
<p>that neither a dog nor any ordinary man is the measure of anything</p>
<p>which he has not learned-am I not right?</p>
<p>Theod. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And the truth of Protagoras being doubted by all, will be</p>
<p>true neither to himself to any one else?</p>
<p>Theod. I think, Socrates, that we are running my old friend too</p>
<p>hard.</p>
<p>Soc. But do not know that we are going beyond the truth.</p>
<p>Doubtless, as he is older, he may be expected to be wiser than we are.</p>
<p>And if he could only just get his head out of the world below, he</p>
<p>would have overthrown both of us again and again, me for talking</p>
<p>nonsense and you for assenting to me, and have been off and</p>
<p>underground in a trice. But as he is not within call, we must make the</p>
<p>best use of our own faculties, such as they are, and speak out what</p>
<p>appears to us to be true. And one thing which no one will deny is,</p>
<p>that there are great differences in the understandings of men.</p>
<p>Theod. In that opinion I quite agree.</p>
<p>Soc. And is there not most likely to be firm ground in the</p>
<p>distinction which we were indicating on behalf of Protagoras, viz.,</p>
<p>that most things, and all immediate sensations, such as hot, dry,</p>
<p>sweet, are only such as they appear; if however difference of</p>
<p>opinion is to be allowed at all, surely we must allow it in respect of</p>
<p>health or disease? for every woman, child, or living creature has</p>
<p>not such a knowledge of what conduces to health as to enable them to</p>
<p>cure themselves.</p>
<p>Theod. I quite agree.</p>
<p>Soc. Or again, in politics, while affirming that just and unjust,</p>
<p>honourable and disgraceful, holy and unholy, are in reality to each</p>
<p>state such as the state thinks and makes lawful, and that in</p>
<p>determining these matters no individual or state is wiser than</p>
<p>another, still the followers of Protagoras will not deny that in</p>
<p>determining what is or is not expedient for the community one state is</p>
<p>wiser and one counsellor better that another-they will scarcely</p>
<p>venture to maintain, that what a city enacts in the belief that it</p>
<p>is expedient will always be really expedient. But in the other case, I</p>
<p>mean when they speak of justice and injustice, piety and impiety, they</p>
<p>are confident that in nature these have no existence or essence of</p>
<p>their own-the truth is that which is agreed on at the time of the</p>
<p>agreement, and as long as the agreement lasts; and this is the</p>
<p>philosophy of many who do not altogether go along with Protagoras.</p>
<p>Here arises a new question, Theodorus, which threatens to be more</p>
<p>serious than the last.</p>
<p>Theod. Well, Socrates, we have plenty of leisure.</p>
<p>Soc. That is true, and your remark recalls to my mind an observation</p>
<p>which I have often made, that those who have passed their days in</p>
<p>the pursuit of philosophy are ridiculously at fault when they have</p>
<p>to appear and speak in court. How natural is this!</p>
<p>Theod. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Soc. I mean to say, that those who have been trained in philosophy</p>
<p>and liberal pursuits are as unlike those who from their youth</p>
<p>upwards have been knocking about in the courts and such places, as a</p>
<p>freeman is in breeding unlike a slave.</p>
<p>Theod. In what is the difference seen?</p>
<p>Soc. In the leisure spoken of by you, which a freeman can always</p>
<p>command: he has his talk, out in peace, and, like ourselves, he</p>
<p>wanders at will from one subject to another, and from a second to a</p>
<p>third,-if the fancy takes him he begins again, as we are doing now,</p>
<p>caring not whether his words are many or few; his only aim is to</p>
<p>attain the truth. But the lawyer is always in a hurry; there is the</p>
<p>water of the clepsydra driving him on, and not allowing him to</p>
<p>expatiate at will: and there is his adversary standing over him,</p>
<p>enforcing his rights; the indictment, which in their phraseology is</p>
<p>termed the affidavit, is recited at the time: and from this he must</p>
<p>not deviate. He is a servant, and is continually disputing about a</p>
<p>fellow servant before his master, who is seated, and has the cause</p>
<p>in his hands; the trial is never about some indifferent matter, but</p>
<p>always concerns himself; and often the race is for his life. The</p>
<p>consequence has been, that he has become keen and shrewd; he has</p>
<p>learned how to flatter his master in word and indulge him in deed; but</p>
<p>his soul is small and unrighteous. His condition, which has been</p>
<p>that of a slave from his youth upwards, has deprived him of growth and</p>
<p>uprightness and independence; dangers and fears, which were too much</p>
<p>for his truth and honesty, came upon him in early years, when the</p>
<p>tenderness of youth was unequal to them, and he has been driven into</p>
<p>crooked ways; from the first he has practised deception and</p>
<p>retaliation, and has become stunted and warped. And so he has passed</p>
<p>out of youth into manhood, having no soundness in him; and is now,</p>
<p>as he thinks, a master in wisdom. Such is the lawyer, Theodorus.</p>
<p>Will you have the companion picture of the philosopher, who is of</p>
<p>our brotherhood; or shall we return to the argument? Do not let us</p>
<p>abuse the freedom of digression which we claim.</p>
<p>Theod. Nay, Socrates, not until we have finished what we are</p>
<p>about; for you truly said that we belong to a brotherhood which is</p>
<p>free, and are not the servants of the argument; but the argument is</p>
<p>our servant, and must wait our leisure. Who is our judge? Or where</p>
<p>is the spectator having any right to censure or control us, as he</p>
<p>might the poets?</p>
<p>Soc. Then, as this is your wish, I will describe the leaders; for</p>
<p>there is no use in talking about the inferior sort. In the first</p>
<p>place, the lords of philosophy have never, from their youth upwards,</p>
<p>known their way to the Agora, or the dicastery, or the council, or any</p>
<p>other political assembly; they neither see nor hear the laws or</p>
<p>decrees, as they are called, of the state written or recited; the</p>
<p>eagerness of political societies in the attainment of office-clubs,</p>
<p>and banquets, and revels, and singing-maidens,-do not enter even</p>
<p>into their dreams. Whether any event has turned out well or ill in the</p>
<p>city, what disgrace may have descended to any one from his</p>
<p>ancestors, male or female, are matters of which the philosopher no</p>
<p>more knows than he can tell, as they say, how many pints are contained</p>
<p>in the ocean. Neither is he conscious of his ignorance. For he does</p>
<p>not hold aloof in order; that he may gain a reputation; but the</p>
<p>truth is, that the outer form of him only is in the city: his mind,</p>
<p>disdaining the littlenesses and nothingnesses of human things, is</p>
<p>&quot;flying all abroad&quot; as Pindar says, measuring earth and heaven and the</p>
<p>things which are under and on the earth and above the heaven,</p>
<p>interrogating the whole nature of each and all in their entirety,</p>
<p>but not condescending to anything which is within reach.</p>
<p>Theod. What do you mean, Socrates?</p>
<p>Soc. I will illustrate my meaning, Theodorus, by the jest which</p>
<p>the clever witty Thracian handmaid is said to have made about</p>
<p>Thales, when he fell into a well as he was looking up at the stars.</p>
<p>She said, that he was so eager to know what was going on in heaven,</p>
<p>that he could not see what was before his feet. This is a jest which</p>
<p>is equally applicable to all philosophers. For the philosopher is</p>
<p>wholly unacquainted with his next-door neighbour; he is ignorant,</p>
<p>not only of what he is doing, but he hardly knows whether he is a</p>
<p>man or an animal; he is searching into the essence of man, and busy in</p>
<p>enquiring what belongs to such a nature to do or suffer different from</p>
<p>any other;-I think that you understand me, Theodorus?</p>
<p>Theod. I do, and what you say is true.</p>
<p>Soc. And thus, my friend, on every occasion, private as well as</p>
<p>public, as I said at first, when he appears in a law-court, or in</p>
<p>any place in which he has to speak of things which are at his feet and</p>
<p>before his eyes, he is the jest, not only of Thracian handmaids but of</p>
<p>the general herd, tumbling into wells and every sort of disaster</p>
<p>through his inexperience. His awkwardness is fearful, and gives the</p>
<p>impression of imbecility. When he is reviled, he has nothing</p>
<p>personal to say in answer to the civilities of his adversaries, for he</p>
<p>knows no scandals of any one, and they do not interest him; and</p>
<p>therefore he is laughed at for his sheepishness; and when others are</p>
<p>being praised and glorified, in the simplicity of his heart he</p>
<p>cannot help going into fits of laughter, so that he seems to be a</p>
<p>downright idiot. When he hears a tyrant or king eulogized, he</p>
<p>fancies that he is listening to the praises of some keeper of cattle-a</p>
<p>swineherd, or shepherd, or perhaps a cowherd, who is congratulated</p>
<p>on the quantity of milk which he squeezes from them; and he remarks</p>
<p>that the creature whom they tend, and out of whom they squeeze the</p>
<p>wealth, is of a less traitable and more insidious nature. Then, again,</p>
<p>he observes that the great man is of necessity as ill-mannered and</p>
<p>uneducated as any shepherd-for he has no leisure, and he is surrounded</p>
<p>by a wall, which is his mountain-pen. Hearing of enormous landed</p>
<p>proprietors of ten thousand acres and more, our philosopher deems this</p>
<p>to be a trifle, because he has been accustomed to think of the whole</p>
<p>earth; and when they sing the, praises of family, and say that someone</p>
<p>is a gentleman because he can show seven generations of wealthy</p>
<p>ancestors, he thinks that their sentiments only betray a dull and</p>
<p>narrow vision in those who utter them, and who are not educated enough</p>
<p>to look at the whole, nor to consider that every man has had thousands</p>
<p>and ten thousands of progenitors, and among them have been rich and</p>
<p>poor, kings and slaves, Hellenes and barbarians, innumerable. And when</p>
<p>people pride themselves on having a pedigree of twenty-five ancestors,</p>
<p>which goes back to Heracles, the son of Amphitryon, he cannot</p>
<p>understand their poverty of ideas. Why are they unable to calculate</p>
<p>that Amphitryon had a twenty-fifth ancestor, who might have been</p>
<p>anybody, and was such as fortune made him and he had a fiftieth, and</p>
<p>so on? He amuses himself with the notion that they cannot count, and</p>
<p>thinks that a little arithmetic would have got rid of their</p>
<p>senseless vanity. Now, in all these cases our philosopher is derided</p>
<p>by the vulgar, partly because he is thought to despise them, and</p>
<p>also because he is ignorant of what is before him, and always at a</p>
<p>loss.</p>
<p>Theod. That is very true, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. But, O my friend, when he draws the other into upper air, and</p>
<p>gets him out of his pleas and rejoinders into the contemplation of</p>
<p>justice and injustice in their own nature and in their difference from</p>
<p>one another and from all other things; or from the commonplaces</p>
<p>about the happiness of a king or of a rich man to the consideration of</p>
<p>government, and of human happiness and misery in general-what they</p>
<p>are, and how a man is to attain the one and avoid the other-when</p>
<p>that narrow, keen, little legal mind is called to account about all</p>
<p>this, he gives the philosopher his revenge; for dizzied by the</p>
<p>height at which he is hanging, whence he looks down into space,</p>
<p>which is a strange experience to him, he being dismayed, and lost, and</p>
<p>stammering broken words, is laughed at, not by Thracian handmaidens or</p>
<p>any other uneducated persons, for they have no eye for the</p>
<p>situation, but by every man who has not been brought up a slave.</p>
<p>Such are the two characters, Theodorus: the one of the freeman, who</p>
<p>has becomes trained in liberty and leisure, whom you call the</p>
<p>philosopher-him we cannot blame because he appears simple and of no</p>
<p>account when he has to perform some menial task, such as packing up</p>
<p>bed-clothes, or flavouring a sauce or fawning speech; the other</p>
<p>character is that of the man who is able to do all this kind of</p>
<p>service smartly and neatly, but knows not how to wear his cloak like a</p>
<p>gentleman; still less with the music of discourse can he hymn the true</p>
<p>life aright which is lived by immortals or men blessed of heaven.</p>
<p>Theod. If you could only persuade everybody, Socrates, as you do me,</p>
<p>of the truth of your words, there would be more peace and fewer</p>
<p>evils among men.</p>
<p>Soc. Evils, Theodorus, can never pass away; for there must always</p>
<p>remain something which is antagonistic to good. Having no place</p>
<p>among the gods in heaven, of necessity they hover around the mortal</p>
<p>nature, and this earthly sphere. Wherefore we ought to fly away from</p>
<p>earth to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become</p>
<p>like God, as far as this is possible; and to become like him, is to</p>
<p>become holy, just, and wise. But, O my friend, you cannot easily</p>
<p>convince mankind that they should pursue virtue or avoid vice, not</p>
<p>merely in order that a man may seem to be good, which is the reason</p>
<p>given by the world, and in my judgment is only a repetition of an</p>
<p>old wives fable. Whereas, the truth is that God is never in any way</p>
<p>unrighteous-he is perfect righteousness; and he of us who is the</p>
<p>most righteous is most like him. Herein is seen the true cleverness of</p>
<p>a man, and also his nothingness and want of manhood. For to know</p>
<p>this is true wisdom and virtue, and ignorance of this is manifest</p>
<p>folly and vice. All other kinds of wisdom or cleverness, which seem</p>
<p>only, such as the wisdom of politicians, or the wisdom of the arts,</p>
<p>are coarse and vulgar. The unrighteous man, or the sayer and doer of</p>
<p>unholy things, had far better not be encouraged in the illusion that</p>
<p>his roguery is clever; for men glory in their shame -they fancy that</p>
<p>they hear others saying of them, &quot;These are not mere good-for</p>
<p>nothing persons, mere burdens of the earth, but such as men should</p>
<p>be who mean to dwell safely in a state.&quot; Let us tell them that they</p>
<p>are all the more truly what they do not think they are because they do</p>
<p>not know it; for they do not know the penalty of injustice, which</p>
<p>above all things they ought to know-not stripes and death, as they</p>
<p>suppose, which evil-doers often escape, but a penalty which cannot</p>
<p>be escaped.</p>
<p>Theod. What is that?</p>
<p>Soc. There are two patterns eternally set before them; the one</p>
<p>blessed and divine, the other godless and wretched: but they do not</p>
<p>see them, or perceive that in their utter folly and infatuation they</p>
<p>are growing like the one and unlike the other, by reason of their evil</p>
<p>deeds; and the penalty is, that they lead a life answering to the</p>
<p>pattern which they are growing like. And if we tell them, that</p>
<p>unless they depart from their cunning, the place of innocence will not</p>
<p>receive them after death; and that here on earth, they will live</p>
<p>ever in the likeness of their own evil selves, and with evil</p>
<p>friends-when they hear this they in their superior cunning will seem</p>
<p>to be listening to the talk of idiots.</p>
<p>Theod. Very true, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. Too true, my friend, as I well know; there is, however, one</p>
<p>peculiarity in their case: when they begin to reason in private</p>
<p>about their dislike of philosophy, if they have the courage to hear</p>
<p>the argument out and do not run away, they grow at last strangely</p>
<p>discontented with themselves; their rhetoric fades away, and they</p>
<p>become helpless as children. These however are digressions from</p>
<p>which we must now desist, or they will overflow, and drown the</p>
<p>original argument; to which, if you please, we will now return.</p>
<p>Theod. For my part, Socrates, I would rather have the digressions,</p>
<p>for at my age I find them easier to follow; but if you wish, let us go</p>
<p>back to the argument.</p>
<p>Soc. Had we not reached the point at which the partisans of the</p>
<p>perpetual flux, who say that things are as they seem to each one, were</p>
<p>confidently maintaining that the ordinances which the state</p>
<p>commanded 2nd thought just, were just to the state which imposed them,</p>
<p>while they were in force; this was especially asserted of justice; but</p>
<p>as to the good, no one had any longer the hardihood to contend of</p>
<p>any ordinances which the state thought and enacted to be good that</p>
<p>these, while they were in force, were really good;-he who said so</p>
<p>would be playing with the name &quot;good,&quot; and would, not touch the real</p>
<p>question-it would be a mockery, would it not?</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly it would.</p>
<p>Soc. He ought not to speak of the name, but of the thing which is</p>
<p>contemplated under the name.</p>
<p>Theod. Right.</p>
<p>Soc. Whatever be the term used, the good or expedient is the aim</p>
<p>of legislation, and as far as she has an opinion, the state imposes</p>
<p>all laws with a view to the greatest expediency; can legislation</p>
<p>have any other aim?</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. But is the aim attained always? do not mistakes often happen?</p>
<p>Theod. Yes, I think that there are mistakes.</p>
<p>Soc. The possibility of error will be more distinctly recognized, if</p>
<p>we put the question in reference to the whole class under which the</p>
<p>good or expedient fall That whole class has to do with the future, and</p>
<p>laws are passed under the idea that they will be useful in after-time;</p>
<p>which, in other words, is the future.</p>
<p>Theod. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. Suppose now, that we ask Protagoras, or one of his disciples, a</p>
<p>question:-O, Protagoras, we will say to him, Man is, as you declare,</p>
<p>the measure of all things-white, heavy, light: of all such things he</p>
<p>is the judge; for he has the criterion of them in himself, and when he</p>
<p>thinks that things are such as he experiences them to be, he thinks</p>
<p>what is and is true to himself. Is it not so?</p>
<p>Theod. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And do you extend your doctrine, Protagoras (as we shall</p>
<p>further say), to the future as well as to the present; and has he</p>
<p>the criterion not only of what in his opinion is but of what will</p>
<p>be, and do things always happen to him as he expected? For example,</p>
<p>take the case of heat:-When an ordinary man thinks that he is going to</p>
<p>have a fever, and that this kind of heat is coming on, and another</p>
<p>person, who is a physician, thinks the contrary, whose opinion is</p>
<p>likely to prove right? Or are they both right?-he will have a heat and</p>
<p>fever in his own judgment, and not have a fever in the physician&#x27;s</p>
<p>judgment?</p>
<p>Theod. How ludicrous!</p>
<p>Soc. And the vinegrower, if I am not mistaken, is a better judge</p>
<p>of the sweetness or dryness of the vintage which is not yet gathered</p>
<p>than the harp-player?</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And in musical composition-the musician will know better than</p>
<p>the training master what the training master himself will hereafter</p>
<p>think harmonious or the reverse?</p>
<p>Theod. Of course.</p>
<p>Soc. And the cook will be a better judge than the guest, who is</p>
<p>not a cook, of the pleasure to be derived from the dinner which is</p>
<p>in preparation; for of present or past pleasure we are not as yet</p>
<p>arguing; but can we say that every one will be to himself the best</p>
<p>judge of the pleasure which will seem to be and will be to him in</p>
<p>the future?-nay, would not you, Protagoras, better guess which</p>
<p>arguments in a court would convince any one of us than the ordinary</p>
<p>man?</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly, Socrates, he used to profess in the strongest</p>
<p>manner that he was the superior of all men in this respect.</p>
<p>Soc. To be sure, friend: who would have paid a large sum for the</p>
<p>privilege of talking to him, if he had really persuaded his visitors</p>
<p>that neither a prophet nor any other man was better able to judge what</p>
<p>will be and seem to be in the future than every one could for himself?</p>
<p>Theod. Who indeed?</p>
<p>Soc. And legislation and expediency are all concerned with the</p>
<p>future; and every one will admit that states, in passing laws, must</p>
<p>often fail of their highest interests?</p>
<p>Theod. Quite true.</p>
<p>Soc. Then we may fairly argue against your master, that he must</p>
<p>admit one man to be wiser than another, and that the wiser is a</p>
<p>measure: but I, who know nothing, am not at all obliged to accept</p>
<p>the honour which the advocate of Protagoras was just now forcing</p>
<p>upon me, whether I would or not, of being a measure of anything.</p>
<p>Theod. That is the best refutation of him, Socrates; although he</p>
<p>is also caught when he ascribes truth to the opinions of others, who</p>
<p>give the lie direct to his own opinion.</p>
<p>Soc. There are many ways, Theodorus, in which the doctrine that</p>
<p>every opinion of: every man is true may be refuted; but there is</p>
<p>more difficulty, in proving that states of feeling, which are</p>
<p>present to a man, and out of which arise sensations and opinions in</p>
<p>accordance with them, are also untrue. And very likely I have been</p>
<p>talking nonsense about them; for they may be unassailable, and those</p>
<p>who say that there is clear evidence of them, and that they are</p>
<p>matters of knowledge, may probably be right; in which case our</p>
<p>friend Theaetetus was not so far from the mark when he identified</p>
<p>perception and knowledge. And therefore let us draw nearer, as the</p>
<p>advocate of Protagoras desires; and the truth of the universal flux</p>
<p>a ring: is the theory sound or not? at any rate, no small war is</p>
<p>raging about it, and there are combination not a few.</p>
<p>Theod. No small, war, indeed, for in most the sect makes rapid</p>
<p>strides, the disciples of Heracleitus are most energetic. upholders of</p>
<p>the doctrine.</p>
<p>Soc. Then we are the more bound, my dear Theodorus, to examine the</p>
<p>question from the foundation as it is set forth by themselves.</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly we are. About these speculations of Heracleitus,</p>
<p>which, as you say, are as old as Homer, or even older still, the</p>
<p>Ephesians themselves, who profess to know them, are downright mad, and</p>
<p>you cannot talk with them on the subject. For, in accordance with</p>
<p>their text-books, they are always in motion; but as for dwelling</p>
<p>upon an argument or a question, and quietly asking and answering in</p>
<p>turn, they can no more do so than they can fly; or rather, the</p>
<p>determination of these fellows not to have a particle of rest in</p>
<p>them is more than the utmost powers of negation can express. If you</p>
<p>ask any of them a question, he will produce, as from a quiver, sayings</p>
<p>brief and dark, and shoot them at you; and if you inquire the reason</p>
<p>of what he has said, you will be hit by some other newfangled word,</p>
<p>and will make no way with any of them, nor they with one another;</p>
<p>their great care is, not to allow of any settled principle either in</p>
<p>their arguments or in their minds, conceiving, as I imagine, that</p>
<p>any such principle would be stationary; for they are at war with the</p>
<p>stationary, and do what they can to drive it out everywhere.</p>
<p>Soc. I suppose, Theodorus, that you have only seen them when they</p>
<p>were fighting, and have never stayed with them in time of peace, for</p>
<p>they are no friends of yours; and their peace doctrines are only</p>
<p>communicated by them at leisure, as I imagine, to those disciples of</p>
<p>theirs whom they want to make like themselves.</p>
<p>Theod. Disciples! my good sir, they have none; men of their sort are</p>
<p>not one another&#x27;s disciples, but they grow up at their own sweet will,</p>
<p>and get their inspiration anywhere, each of them saying of his</p>
<p>neighbour that he knows nothing. Fro these men, then, as I was going</p>
<p>to remark, you will never get a reason, whether with their will or</p>
<p>without their will; we must take the question out of their hands,</p>
<p>and make the analysis ourselves, as if we were doing geometrical</p>
<p>problem.</p>
<p>Soc. Quite right too; but as touching the aforesaid problem, have we</p>
<p>not heard from the ancients, who concealed their wisdom from the</p>
<p>many in poetical figures, that Oceanus and Tethys, the origin of all</p>
<p>things, are streams, and that nothing is at rest? And now the moderns,</p>
<p>in their superior wisdom, have declared the same openly, that the</p>
<p>cobbler too may hear and learn of them, and no longer foolishly</p>
<p>imagine that some things are at rest and others in motion-having</p>
<p>learned that all is motion, he will duly honour his teachers. I had</p>
<p>almost forgotten the opposite doctrine, Theodorus,</p>
<p>Alone Being remains unmoved, which is the name for the all.</p>
<p>This is the language of Parmenides, Melissus, and their followers, who</p>
<p>stoutly maintain that all being is one and self-contained, and has</p>
<p>no place which to move. What shall we do, friend, with all these</p>
<p>people; for, advancing step by step, we have imperceptibly got between</p>
<p>the combatants, and, unless we can protect our retreat, we shall pay</p>
<p>the penalty of our rashness-like the players in the palaestra who</p>
<p>are caught upon the line, and are dragged different ways by the two</p>
<p>parties. Therefore I think that we had better begin by considering</p>
<p>those whom we first accosted, &quot;the river-gods,&quot; and, if we find any</p>
<p>truth in them, we will help them to pull us over, and try to get</p>
<p>away from the others. But if the partisans of &quot;the whole&quot; appear to</p>
<p>speak more truly, we will fly off from the party which would move</p>
<p>the immovable, to them. And if I find that neither of them have</p>
<p>anything reasonable to say, we shall be in a ridiculous position,</p>
<p>having so great a conceit of our own poor opinion and rejecting that</p>
<p>of ancient and famous men. O Theodorus, do you think that there is any</p>
<p>use in proceeding when the danger is so great?</p>
<p>Theod. Nay, Socrates, not to examine thoroughly what the two parties</p>
<p>have to say would be quite intolerable.</p>
<p>Soc. Then examine we must, since you, who were so reluctant. to</p>
<p>begin, are so eager to proceed. The nature of motion appears to be the</p>
<p>question with which we begin. What do they mean when they say that all</p>
<p>things are in motion? Is there only one kind of motion, or, as I</p>
<p>rather incline to think, two? should like to have your opinion upon</p>
<p>this point in addition to my own, that I may err, if I must err, in</p>
<p>your company; tell me, then, when a thing changes from one place to</p>
<p>another, or goes round in the same place, is not that what is called</p>
<p>motion?</p>
<p>Theod. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Here then we have one kind of motion. But when a thing,</p>
<p>remaining on the same spot, grows old, or becomes black from being</p>
<p>white, or hard from being soft, or undergoes any other change, may not</p>
<p>this be properly called motion of another kind?</p>
<p>Theod. I think so.</p>
<p>Soc. Say rather that it must be so. Of motion then there are these</p>
<p>two kinds, &quot;change,&quot; and &quot;motion in place.&quot;</p>
<p>Theod. You are right.</p>
<p>Soc. And now, having made this distinction, let us address ourselves</p>
<p>to those who say that all is motion, and ask them whether all things</p>
<p>according to them have the two kinds of motion, and are changed as</p>
<p>well as move in place, or is one thing moved in both ways, and another</p>
<p>in one only?</p>
<p>Theod. Indeed, I do not know what to answer; but I think they</p>
<p>would say that all things are moved in both ways.</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, comrade; for, if not, they would have to say that the same</p>
<p>things are in motion and at rest, and there would be no more truth</p>
<p>in saying that all things are in motion, than that all things are at</p>
<p>rest.</p>
<p>Theod. To be sure.</p>
<p>Soc. And if they are to be in motion, and nothing is to be devoid of</p>
<p>motion, all things must always have every sort of motion?</p>
<p>Theod. Most true.</p>
<p>Soc. Consider a further point: did we not understand them to explain</p>
<p>the generation of heat, whiteness, or anything else, in some such</p>
<p>manner as the following:-were they not saying that each of them is</p>
<p>moving between the agent and the patient, together with a</p>
<p>perception, and that the patient ceases to be a perceiving power and</p>
<p>becomes a percipient, and the agent a quale instead of a quality? I</p>
<p>suspect that quality may appear a strange and uncouth term to you, and</p>
<p>that you do not understand the abstract expression. Then I will take</p>
<p>concrete instances: I mean to say that the producing power or agent</p>
<p>becomes neither heat nor whiteness but hot and white, and the like</p>
<p>of other things. For I must repeat what I said before, that neither</p>
<p>the agent nor patient have any absolute existence, but when they</p>
<p>come together and generate sensations and their objects, the one</p>
<p>becomes a thing a certain quality, and the other a percipient. You</p>
<p>remember?</p>
<p>Theod. Of course.</p>
<p>Soc. We may leave the details of their theory unexamined, but we</p>
<p>must not forget to ask them the only question with which we are</p>
<p>concerned: Are all things in motion and flux?</p>
<p>Theod. Yes, they will reply.</p>
<p>Soc. And they are moved in both those ways which we distinguished,</p>
<p>that is to Way, they move in place and are also changed?</p>
<p>Theod. Of course, if the motion is to be perfect.</p>
<p>Soc. If they only moved in place and were not changed, we should</p>
<p>be able to say what is the nature of the things which are in motion</p>
<p>and flux.</p>
<p>Theod. Exactly.</p>
<p>Soc. But now, since not even white continues to flow white, and</p>
<p>whiteness itself is a flux or change which is passing into another</p>
<p>colour, and is never to be caught standing still, can the name of</p>
<p>any colour be rightly used at all?</p>
<p>Theod. How is that possible, Socrates, either in the case of this or</p>
<p>of any other quality-if while we are using the word the object is</p>
<p>escaping in the flux?</p>
<p>Soc. And what would you say of perceptions, such as sight and</p>
<p>hearing, or any other kind of perception? Is there any stopping in the</p>
<p>act of seeing and hearing?</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly not, if all things are in motion.</p>
<p>Soc. Then we must not speak of seeing any more than of not-seeing,</p>
<p>nor of any other perception more than of any non-perception, if all</p>
<p>things partake of every kind of motion?</p>
<p>Theod. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. Yet perception is knowledge: so at least Theaetetus and I</p>
<p>were saying.</p>
<p>Theod. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. Then when we were asked what is knowledge, we no more</p>
<p>answered what is knowledge than what is not knowledge?</p>
<p>Theod. I suppose not.</p>
<p>Soc. Here, then, is a fine result: we corrected our first answer</p>
<p>in our eagerness to prove that nothing is at rest. But if nothing is</p>
<p>at rest, every answer upon whatever subject is equally right: you</p>
<p>may say that a thing is or is not thus; or, if you prefer, &quot;becomes&quot;</p>
<p>thus; and if we say &quot;becomes,&quot; we shall not then hamper them with</p>
<p>words expressive of rest.</p>
<p>Theod. Quite true.</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, Theodorus, except in saying &quot;thus&quot; and &quot;not thus.&quot; But you</p>
<p>ought not to use the word &quot;thus,&quot; for there is no motion in &quot;thus&quot;</p>
<p>or in &quot;not thus.&quot; The maintainers of the doctrine have as yet no words</p>
<p>in which to express themselves, and must get a new language. I know of</p>
<p>no word that will suit them, except perhaps &quot;no how,&quot; which is</p>
<p>perfectly indefinite.</p>
<p>Theod. Yes, that is a manner of speaking in which they will be quite</p>
<p>at home.</p>
<p>Soc. And so, Theodorus, we have got rid of your friend without</p>
<p>assenting to his doctrine, that every man is the measure of all</p>
<p>things-a wise man only is a measure; neither can we allow that</p>
<p>knowledge is perception, certainly not on the hypothesis of a</p>
<p>perpetual flux, unless perchance our friend Theaetetus is able to</p>
<p>convince us that it is.</p>
<p>Theod. Very good, Socrates; and now that the argument about the</p>
<p>doctrine of Protagoras has been completed, I am absolved from</p>
<p>answering; for this was the agreement.</p>
<p>Theaet. Not, Theodorus, until you and Socrates have discussed the</p>
<p>doctrine of those who say that all things are at rest, as you were</p>
<p>proposing.</p>
<p>Theod. You, Theaetetus, who are a young rogue, must not instigate</p>
<p>your elders to a breach of faith, but should prepare to answer</p>
<p>Socrates in the remainder of the argument.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, if he wishes; but I would rather have heard about the</p>
<p>doctrine of rest.</p>
<p>Theod. Invite Socrates to an argument-invite horsemen to the open</p>
<p>plain; do but ask him, and he will answer.</p>
<p>Soc. Nevertheless, Theodorus, I am afraid that I shall not be able</p>
<p>to comply with the request of Theaetetus.</p>
<p>Theod. Not comply! for what reason?</p>
<p>Soc. My reason is that I have a kind of reverence; not so much for</p>
<p>Melissus and the others, who say that &quot;All is one and at rest,&quot; as for</p>
<p>the great leader himself, Parmenides, venerable and awful, as in</p>
<p>Homeric language he may be called;-him I should be ashamed to approach</p>
<p>in a spirit unworthy of him. I met him when he was an old man, and I</p>
<p>was a mere youth, and he appeared to me to have a glorious depth of</p>
<p>mind. And I am afraid that we may not understand his words, and may be</p>
<p>still further from understanding his meaning; above all I fear that</p>
<p>the nature of knowledge, which is the main subject of our</p>
<p>discussion, may be thrust out of sight by the unbidden guests who will</p>
<p>come pouring in upon our feast of discourse, if we let them</p>
<p>in-besides, the question which is now stirring is of immense extent,</p>
<p>and will be treated unfairly if only considered by the way; or if</p>
<p>treated adequately and at length, will put into the shade the other</p>
<p>question of knowledge. Neither the one nor the other can be allowed;</p>
<p>but I must try by my art of midwifery to deliver Theaetetus of his</p>
<p>conceptions about knowledge.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very well; do so if you will.</p>
<p>Soc. Then now, Theaetetus, take another view of the subject: you</p>
<p>answered that knowledge is perception?</p>
<p>Theaet. I did.</p>
<p>Soc. And if any one were to ask you: With what does a man see</p>
<p>black and white colours? and with what does he hear high and low</p>
<p>sounds?-you would say, if I am not mistaken, &quot;With the eyes and with</p>
<p>the ears.&quot;</p>
<p>Theaet. I should.</p>
<p>Soc. The free use of words and phrases, rather than minute</p>
<p>precision, is generally characteristic of a liberal education, and the</p>
<p>opposite is pedantic; but sometimes precision. is necessary, and I</p>
<p>believe that the answer which you have just given is open to the</p>
<p>charge of incorrectness; for which is more correct, to say that we see</p>
<p>or hear with the eyes and with the ears, or through the eyes and</p>
<p>through the ears.</p>
<p>Theaet. I should say &quot;through,&quot; Socrates, rather than &quot;with.&quot;</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, my boy, for no one can suppose that in each of us, as in a</p>
<p>sort of Trojan horse, there are perched a number of unconnected</p>
<p>senses, which do not all meet in some one nature, the mind, or</p>
<p>whatever we please to call it, of which they are the instruments,</p>
<p>and with which through them we perceive objects of sense.</p>
<p>Theaet. I agree with you in that opinion.</p>
<p>Soc. The reason why I am thus precise is, because I want to know</p>
<p>whether, when we perceive black and white through the eyes, and again,</p>
<p>other qualities through other organs, we do not perceive them with one</p>
<p>and the same part of ourselves, and, if you were asked, you might</p>
<p>refer all such perceptions to the body. Perhaps, however, I had better</p>
<p>allow you to answer for yourself and not interfere; Tell me, then, are</p>
<p>not the organs through which you perceive warm and hard and light</p>
<p>and sweet, organs of the body?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of the body, certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And you would admit that what you perceive through one</p>
<p>faculty you cannot perceive through another; the objects of hearing,</p>
<p>for example, cannot be perceived through sight, or the objects of</p>
<p>sight through hearing?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course not.</p>
<p>Soc. If you have any thought about both of them, this common</p>
<p>perception cannot come to you, either through the one or the other</p>
<p>organ?</p>
<p>Theaet. It cannot.</p>
<p>Soc. How about sounds and colours: in the first place you would</p>
<p>admit that they both exist?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And that either of them is different from the other, and the</p>
<p>same with itself?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And that both are two and each of them one?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. You can further observe whether they are like or unlike one</p>
<p>another?</p>
<p>Theaet. I dare say.</p>
<p>Soc. But through what do you perceive all this about them? for</p>
<p>neither through hearing nor yet through seeing can you apprehend</p>
<p>that which they have in common. Let me give you an illustration of the</p>
<p>point at issue:-If there were any meaning in asking whether sounds and</p>
<p>colours are saline or not, you would be able to tell me what faculty</p>
<p>would consider the question. It would not be sight or hearing, but</p>
<p>some other.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly; the faculty of taste.</p>
<p>Soc. Very good; and now tell me what is the power which discerns,</p>
<p>not only in sensible objects, but in all things, universal notions,</p>
<p>such as those which are called being and not-being, and those others</p>
<p>about which we were just asking-what organs will you assign for the</p>
<p>perception of these notions?</p>
<p>Theaet. You are thinking of being and not being, likeness and</p>
<p>unlikeness, sameness and difference, and also of unity and other</p>
<p>numbers which are applied to objects of sense; and you mean to ask,</p>
<p>through what bodily organ the soul perceives odd and even numbers</p>
<p>and other arithmetical conceptions.</p>
<p>Soc. You follow me excellently, Theaetetus; that is precisely what I</p>
<p>am asking.</p>
<p>Theaet. Indeed, Socrates, I cannot answer; my only notion is, that</p>
<p>these, unlike objects of sense, have no separate organ, but that the</p>
<p>mind, by a power of her own, contemplates the universals in all</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>Soc. You are a beauty, Theaetetus, and not ugly, as Theodorus was</p>
<p>saying; for he who utters the beautiful is himself beautiful and good.</p>
<p>And besides being beautiful, you have done me a kindness in</p>
<p>releasing me from a very long discussion, if you are clear that the</p>
<p>soul views some things by herself and others through the bodily</p>
<p>organs. For that was my own opinion, and I wanted you to agree with</p>
<p>me.</p>
<p>Theaet. I am quite clear.</p>
<p>Soc. And to which class would you refer being or essence; for</p>
<p>this, of all our notions, is the most universal?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should say, to that class which the soul aspires to know</p>
<p>of herself.</p>
<p>Soc. And would you say this also of like and unlike, same and other?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And would you say the same of the noble and base, and of good</p>
<p>and evil?</p>
<p>Theaet. These I conceive to be notions which are essentially</p>
<p>relative, and which the soul also perceives by comparing in herself</p>
<p>things past and present with the future.</p>
<p>Soc. And does she not perceive the hardness of that which is hard by</p>
<p>the touch, and the softness of that which is soft equally by the</p>
<p>touch?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. But their essence and what they are, and their opposition to</p>
<p>one another, and the essential nature of this opposition, the soul</p>
<p>herself endeavours to decide for us by the review and comparison of</p>
<p>them?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. The simple sensations which reach the soul through the body are</p>
<p>given at birth to men and animals by nature, but their reflections</p>
<p>on the being and use of them are slowly and hardly gained, if they are</p>
<p>ever gained, by education and long experience.</p>
<p>Theaet. Assuredly.</p>
<p>Soc. And can a man attain truth who fails of attaining being?</p>
<p>Theaet. Impossible.</p>
<p>Soc. And can he who misses the truth of anything, have a knowledge</p>
<p>of that thing?</p>
<p>Theaet. He cannot.</p>
<p>Soc. Then knowledge does not consist in impressions of sense, but in</p>
<p>reasoning about them; in that only, and not in the mere impression,</p>
<p>truth and being can be attained?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. And would you call the two processes by the same name, when</p>
<p>there is so great difference between them?</p>
<p>Theaet. That would certainly not be right.</p>
<p>Soc. And what name would you give to seeing, hearing, smelling,</p>
<p>being cold and being hot?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should call all of them perceiving-what other name could</p>
<p>be given to them?</p>
<p>Soc. Perception would be the collective name of them?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Which, as we say, has no part in the attainment of truth any</p>
<p>more of being?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. And therefore not in. science or knowledge?</p>
<p>Theaet. No.</p>
<p>Soc. Then perception, Theaetetus, can never be the same as knowledge</p>
<p>or science?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly not, Socrates; and knowledge has now been most</p>
<p>distinctly proved to be different from perception.</p>
<p>Soc. But the original aim of our discussion was to find out rather</p>
<p>what knowledge is than what it is not; at the same time we have made</p>
<p>some progress, for we no longer seek for knowledge, in perception at</p>
<p>all, but in that other process, however called, in which the mind is</p>
<p>alone and engaged with being.</p>
<p>Theaet. You mean, Socrates, if I am not mistaken, what is called</p>
<p>thinking or opining.</p>
<p>Soc. You conceive truly. And now, my friend, Please to begin again</p>
<p>at this point; and having wiped out of your memory all that has</p>
<p>preceded, see if you have arrived at any clearer view, and once more</p>
<p>say what is knowledge.</p>
<p>Theaet. I cannot say, Socrates, that all opinion is knowledge,</p>
<p>because there may be a false opinion; but I will venture to assert,</p>
<p>that knowledge is true opinion: let this then be my reply; and if this</p>
<p>is hereafter disproved, I must try to find another.</p>
<p>Soc. That is the way in which you ought to answer, Theaetetus, and</p>
<p>not in your former hesitating strain, for if we are bold we shall gain</p>
<p>one of two advantages; either we shall find what we seek, or we</p>
<p>shall be less likely to think that we know what we do not know-in</p>
<p>either case we shall be richly rewarded. And now, what are you</p>
<p>saying?-Are there two sorts of opinion, one true and the other</p>
<p>false; and do you define knowledge to be the true?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, according to my present view.</p>
<p>Soc. Is it still worth our while to resume the discussion touching</p>
<p>opinion?</p>
<p>Theaet. To what are you alluding?</p>
<p>Soc. There is a point which often troubles me, and is a great</p>
<p>perplexity to me, both in regard to myself and others. I cannot make</p>
<p>out the nature or origin of the mental experience to which I refer.</p>
<p>Theaet. Pray what is it?</p>
<p>Soc. How there can be-false opinion-that difficulty still troubles</p>
<p>the eye of my mind; and I am uncertain whether I shall leave the</p>
<p>question, or over again in a new way.</p>
<p>Theaet. Begin again, Socrates,-at least if you think that there is</p>
<p>the slightest necessity for doing so. Were not you and Theodorus</p>
<p>just now remarking very truly, that in discussions of this kind we may</p>
<p>take our own time?</p>
<p>Soc. You are quite right, and perhaps there will be no harm in</p>
<p>retracing our steps and beginning again. Better a little which is well</p>
<p>done, than a great deal imperfectly.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, and what is the difficulty? Do we not speak of false</p>
<p>opinion, and say that one man holds a false and another a true</p>
<p>opinion, as though there were some natural distinction between them?</p>
<p>Theaet. We certainly say so.</p>
<p>Soc. All things and everything are either known or not known. I</p>
<p>leave out of view the intermediate conceptions of learning and</p>
<p>forgetting, because they have nothing to do with our present question.</p>
<p>Theaet. There can be no doubt, Socrates, if you exclude these,</p>
<p>that there is no other alternative but knowing or not knowing a thing.</p>
<p>Soc. That point being now determined, must we not say that he who</p>
<p>has an opinion, must have an opinion about something which he knows or</p>
<p>does not know?</p>
<p>Theaet. He must.</p>
<p>Soc. He who knows, cannot but know; and he who does not know, cannot</p>
<p>know?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course.</p>
<p>Soc. What shall we say then? When a man has a false opinion does</p>
<p>he think that which he knows to be some other thing which he knows,</p>
<p>and knowing both, is he at the same time ignorant of both?</p>
<p>Theaet. That, Socrates, is impossible.</p>
<p>Soc. But perhaps he thinks of something which he does not know as</p>
<p>some other thing which he does not know; for example, he knows neither</p>
<p>Theaetetus nor Socrates, and yet he fancies that Theaetetus is</p>
<p>Socrates, or Socrates Theaetetus?</p>
<p>Theaet. How can he?</p>
<p>Soc. But surely he cannot suppose what he knows to be what he does</p>
<p>not know, or what he does not know to be what he knows?</p>
<p>Theaet. That would be monstrous.</p>
<p>Soc. Where, then, is false opinion? For if all things are either</p>
<p>known or unknown, there can be no opinion which is not comprehended</p>
<p>under this alternative, and so false opinion is excluded.</p>
<p>Theaes. Most true.</p>
<p>Soc. Suppose that we remove the question out of the sphere of</p>
<p>knowing or not knowing, into that of being and not-being.</p>
<p>Theaet. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Soc. May we not suspect the simple truth to be that he who thinks</p>
<p>about anything, that which. is not, will necessarily think what is</p>
<p>false, whatever in other respects may be the state of his mind?</p>
<p>Theaet. That, again, is not unlikely, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. Then suppose some one to say to us, Theaetetus:-Is it</p>
<p>possible for any man to think that which is not, either as a</p>
<p>self-existent substance or as a predicate of something else? And</p>
<p>suppose that we answer, &quot;Yes, he can, when he thinks what is not</p>
<p>true.&quot;-That will be our answer?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. But is there any parallel to this?</p>
<p>Theaet. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Soc. Can a man see something and yet see nothing?</p>
<p>Theaet. Impossible.</p>
<p>Soc. But if he sees any one thing, he sees something that exists. Do</p>
<p>you suppose that what is one is ever to be found among nonexisting</p>
<p>things?</p>
<p>Theaet. I do not.</p>
<p>Soc. He then who sees some one thing, sees something which is?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. And he who hears anything, hears some one thing, and hears that</p>
<p>which is?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And he who touches anything, touches something which is one and</p>
<p>therefore is?</p>
<p>Theaet. That again is true.</p>
<p>Soc. And does not he who thinks, think some one thing?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And does not he who thinks some one thing, think something</p>
<p>which is?</p>
<p>Theaet. I agree.</p>
<p>Soc. Then he who thinks of that which is not, thinks of nothing?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. And he who thinks of nothing, does not think at all?</p>
<p>Theaet. Obviously.</p>
<p>Soc. Then no one can think that which is not, either as a</p>
<p>self-existent substance or as a predicate of something else?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly not.</p>
<p>Soc. Then to think falsely is different from thinking that which</p>
<p>is not?</p>
<p>Theaet. It would seem so.</p>
<p>Soc. Then false opinion has no existence in us, either in the sphere</p>
<p>of being or of knowledge?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. But may not the following be the description of what we express</p>
<p>by this name?</p>
<p>Theaet. What?</p>
<p>Soc. May we not suppose that false opinion or thought is a sort of</p>
<p>heterodoxy; a person may make an exchange in his mind, and say that</p>
<p>one real object is another real object. For thus he always thinks that</p>
<p>which is, but he puts one thing in place of another; and missing the</p>
<p>aim of his thoughts, he may be truly said to have false opinion.</p>
<p>Theaet. Now you appear to me to have spoken the exact truth: when</p>
<p>a man puts the base in the place of the noble, or the noble in the</p>
<p>place of the base, then he has truly false opinion.</p>
<p>Soc. I see, Theaetetus, that your fear has disappeared, and that you</p>
<p>are beginning to despise me.</p>
<p>Theaet. What makes you say so?</p>
<p>Soc. You think, if I am not mistaken, that your &quot;truly false&quot; is</p>
<p>safe from censure, and that I shall never ask whether there can be a</p>
<p>swift which is slow, or a heavy which is light, or any other</p>
<p>self-contradictory thing, which works, not according to its own</p>
<p>nature, but according to that of its opposite. But I will not insist</p>
<p>upon this, for I do not wish needlessly to discourage you. And so</p>
<p>you are satisfied that false opinion is heterodoxy, or the thought</p>
<p>of something else?</p>
<p>Theaet. I am.</p>
<p>Soc. It is possible then upon your view for the mind to conceive</p>
<p>of one thing as another?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. But must not the mind, or thinking power, which misplaces them,</p>
<p>have a conception either of both objects or of one of them?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Either together or in succession?</p>
<p>Theaet. Very good.</p>
<p>Soc. And do you mean by conceiving, the same which I mean?</p>
<p>Theaet. What is that?</p>
<p>Soc. I mean the conversation which the soul holds with herself in</p>
<p>considering of anything. I speak of what I scarcely understand; but</p>
<p>the soul when thinking appears to me to be just talking-asking</p>
<p>questions of herself and answering them, affirming and denying. And</p>
<p>when she has arrived at a decision, either gradually or by a sudden</p>
<p>impulse, and has at last agreed, and does not doubt, this is called</p>
<p>her opinion. I say, then, that to form an opinion is to speak, and</p>
<p>opinion is a word spoken,-I mean, to oneself and in silence, not aloud</p>
<p>or to another: What think you?</p>
<p>Theaet. I agree.</p>
<p>Soc. Then when any one thinks of one thing as another, he is</p>
<p>saying to himself that one thing is another?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. But do you ever remember saying to yourself that the noble is</p>
<p>certainly base, or the unjust just; or, best of all-have you ever</p>
<p>attempted to convince yourself that one thing is another? Nay, not</p>
<p>even in sleep, did you ever venture to say to yourself that odd is</p>
<p>even, or anything of the kind?</p>
<p>Theaet. Never.</p>
<p>Soc. And do you suppose that any other man, either in his senses</p>
<p>or out of them, ever seriously tried to persuade himself that an ox is</p>
<p>a horse, or that two are one?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. But if thinking is talking to oneself, no one speaking and</p>
<p>thinking of two objects, and apprehending them both in his soul,</p>
<p>will say and think that the one is the other of them, and I must</p>
<p>add, that even you, lover of dispute as you are, had better let the</p>
<p>word &quot;other&quot; alone [i.e., not insist that &quot;one&quot; and &quot;other&quot; are the</p>
<p>same]. I mean to say, that no one thinks the noble to be base, or</p>
<p>anything of the kind.</p>
<p>Theaet. I will give up the word &quot;other,&quot; Socrates; and I agree to</p>
<p>what you say.</p>
<p>Soc. If a man has both of them in his thoughts, he cannot think that</p>
<p>the one of them is the other?</p>
<p>Theat. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Neither, if he has one of them only in his mind and not the</p>
<p>other, can he think that one is the other?</p>
<p>Theaet. True; for we should have to suppose that he apprehends</p>
<p>that which is not in his thoughts at all.</p>
<p>Soc. Then no one who has either both or only one of the two</p>
<p>objects in his mind can think that the one is the other. And</p>
<p>therefore, he who maintains that false opinion is heterodoxy is</p>
<p>talking nonsense; for neither in this, any more than in the previous</p>
<p>way, can false opinion exist in us.</p>
<p>Theaet. No.</p>
<p>Soc. But if, Theaetetus, this is not admitted, we shall be driven</p>
<p>into many absurdities.</p>
<p>Theaet. What are they?</p>
<p>Soc. I will not tell you until I have endeavoured to consider the</p>
<p>matter from every point of view. For I should be ashamed of us if we</p>
<p>were driven in our perplexity to admit the absurd consequences of</p>
<p>which I speak. But if we find the solution, and get away from them, we</p>
<p>may regard them only as the difficulties of others, and the ridicule</p>
<p>will not attach to us. On the other hand, if we utterly fail, I</p>
<p>suppose that we must be humble, and allow the argument to trample us</p>
<p>under foot, as the sea-sick passenger is trampled upon by the</p>
<p>sailor, and to do anything to us. Listen, then, while I tell you how I</p>
<p>hope to find a way out of our difficulty.</p>
<p>Theaet. Let me hear.</p>
<p>Soc. I think that we were wrong in denying that a man could think</p>
<p>what he knew to be what he did not know; and that there is a way in</p>
<p>which such a deception is possible.</p>
<p>Theaet. You mean to say, as I suspected at the time, that I may know</p>
<p>Socrates, and at a distance see some one who is unknown to me, and</p>
<p>whom I mistake for him-them the deception will occur?</p>
<p>Soc. But has not that position been relinquished by us, because</p>
<p>involving the absurdity that we should know and not know the things</p>
<p>which we know?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Let us make the assertion in another form, which may or may not</p>
<p>have a favourable issue; but as we are in a great strait, every</p>
<p>argument should be turned over and tested. Tell me, then, whether I am</p>
<p>right in saying that you may learn a thing which at one time you did</p>
<p>not know?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly you may.</p>
<p>Soc. And another and another?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. I would have you imagine, then, that there exists in the mind</p>
<p>of man a block of wax, which is of different sizes in different men;</p>
<p>harder, moister, and having more or less of purity in one than</p>
<p>another, and in some of an intermediate quality.</p>
<p>Theaet. I see.</p>
<p>Soc. Let us say that this tablet is a gift of Memory, the mother</p>
<p>of the Muses; and that when we wish to remember anything which we have</p>
<p>seen, or heard, or thought in our own minds, we hold the wax to the</p>
<p>perceptions and thoughts, and in that material receive the</p>
<p>impression of them as from the seal of a ring; and that we remember</p>
<p>and know what is imprinted as long as the image lasts; but when the</p>
<p>image is effaced, or cannot be taken, then we forget and do not know.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very good.</p>
<p>Soc. Now, when a person has this knowledge, and is considering</p>
<p>something which he sees or hears, may not false opinion arise in the</p>
<p>following manner?</p>
<p>Theaet. In what manner?</p>
<p>Soc. When he thinks what he knows, sometimes to be what he knows,</p>
<p>and sometimes to be what he does not know. We were wrong before in</p>
<p>denying the possibility of this.</p>
<p>Theaet. And how would you amend the former statement?</p>
<p>Soc. I should begin by making a list of the impossible cases which</p>
<p>must be excluded. (1) No one can think one thing to be another when he</p>
<p>does not perceive either of them, but has the memorial or seal of both</p>
<p>of them in his mind; nor can any mistaking of one thing for another</p>
<p>occur, when he only knows one, and does not know, and has no</p>
<p>impression of the other; nor can he think that one thing which he does</p>
<p>not know is another thing which he does not know, or that what he does</p>
<p>not know is what he knows; nor (2) that one thing which he perceives</p>
<p>is another thing which he perceives, or that something which he</p>
<p>perceives is something which he does not perceive; or that something</p>
<p>which he does not perceive is something else which he does not</p>
<p>perceive; or that something which he does not perceive is something</p>
<p>which he perceives; nor again (3) can he think that something which he</p>
<p>knows and perceives, and of which he has the impression coinciding</p>
<p>with sense, is something else which he knows and perceives, and of</p>
<p>which he has the impression coinciding with sense;-this last case,</p>
<p>if possible, is still more inconceivable than the others; nor (4)</p>
<p>can he think that something which he knows and perceives, and of which</p>
<p>he has the memorial coinciding with sense, is something else which</p>
<p>he knows; nor so long as these agree, can he think that a thing</p>
<p>which he knows and perceives is another thing which he perceives; or</p>
<p>that a thing which he does not know and does not perceive, is the same</p>
<p>as another thing which he does not know and does not perceive;-nor</p>
<p>again, can he suppose that a thing which he does not know and does not</p>
<p>perceive is the same as another thing which he does not know; or</p>
<p>that a thing which he does not know and does not perceive is another</p>
<p>thing which he does not perceive:-All these utterly and absolutely</p>
<p>exclude the possibility of false opinion. The only cases, if any,</p>
<p>which remain, are the following.</p>
<p>Theaet. What are they? If you tell me, I may perhaps understand</p>
<p>you better; but at present I am unable to follow you.</p>
<p>Soc. A person may think that some things which he knows, or which he</p>
<p>perceives and does not know, are some other things which he knows</p>
<p>and perceives; or that some things which he knows and perceives, are</p>
<p>other things which he knows and perceives.</p>
<p>Theaet. I understand you less than ever now.</p>
<p>Soc. Hear me once more, then:-I, knowing Theodorus, and</p>
<p>remembering in my own mind what sort of person he is, and also what</p>
<p>sort of person Theaetetus is, at one time see them, and at another</p>
<p>time do not see them, and sometimes I touch them, and at another</p>
<p>time not, or at one time I may hear them or perceive them in some</p>
<p>other way, and at another time not perceive them, but still I remember</p>
<p>them, and know them in my own mind.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. Then, first of all, I want you to understand that a man may</p>
<p>or may not perceive sensibly that which he knows.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And that which he does not know will sometimes not be perceived</p>
<p>by him and sometimes will be perceived and only perceived?</p>
<p>Theaet. That is also true.</p>
<p>Soc. See whether you can follow me better now: Socrates can</p>
<p>recognize Theodorus and Theaetetus, but he sees neither of them, nor</p>
<p>does he perceive them in any other way; he cannot then by any</p>
<p>possibility imagine in his own mind that Theaetetus is Theodorus. Am I</p>
<p>not right?</p>
<p>Theaet. You are quite right.</p>
<p>Soc. Then that was the first case of which I spoke.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. The second case was, that I, knowing one of you and not knowing</p>
<p>the other, and perceiving neither, can never think him whom I know</p>
<p>to be him whom I do not know.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. In the third case, not knowing and not perceiving either of</p>
<p>you, I cannot think that one of you whom I do not know is the other</p>
<p>whom I do not know. I need not again go over the catalogue of excluded</p>
<p>cases, in which I cannot form a false opinion about you and Theodorus,</p>
<p>either when I know both or when I am in ignorance of both, or when I</p>
<p>know one and not the other. And the same of perceiving: do you</p>
<p>understand me?</p>
<p>Theaet. I do.</p>
<p>Soc. The only possibility of erroneous opinion is, when knowing</p>
<p>you and Theodorus, and having on the waxen block the impression of</p>
<p>both of you given as by a seal, but seeing you imperfectly and at a</p>
<p>distance, I try to assign the right impression of memory to the</p>
<p>right visual impression, and to fit this into its own print: if I</p>
<p>succeed, recognition will take place; but if I fad and transpose them,</p>
<p>putting the foot into the wrong shoe-that is to say, putting the</p>
<p>vision of either of you on to the wrong impression, or if my mind,</p>
<p>like the sight in a mirror, which is transferred from right to left,</p>
<p>err by reason of some similar affection, then &quot;heterodoxy&quot; and false</p>
<p>opinion ensues.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, Socrates, you have described the nature of opinion with</p>
<p>wonderful exactness.</p>
<p>Soc. Or again, when I know both of you, and perceive as well as know</p>
<p>one of you, but not the other, and my knowledge of him does not accord</p>
<p>with perception-that was the case put by me just now which you did not</p>
<p>understand</p>
<p>Theaet. No, I did not.</p>
<p>Soc. I meant to say, that when a person knows and perceives one of</p>
<p>you, his knowledge coincides with his perception, he will never</p>
<p>think him to be some other person, whom he knows and perceives, and</p>
<p>the knowledge of whom coincides with his perception-for that also</p>
<p>was a case supposed.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. But there was an omission of the further case, in which, as</p>
<p>we now say, false opinion may arise, when knowing both, and seeing, or</p>
<p>having some other sensible perception of both, I fail in holding the</p>
<p>seal over against the corresponding sensation; like a bad archer, I</p>
<p>miss and fall wide of the mark-and this is called falsehood.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes; it is rightly so called.</p>
<p>Soc. When, therefore, perception is present to one of the seals or</p>
<p>impressions but not to the other, and the mind fits the seal of the</p>
<p>absent perception on the one which is present, in any case of this</p>
<p>sort the mind is deceived; in a word, if our view is sound, there</p>
<p>can be no error or deception about things which a man does not know</p>
<p>and has never perceived, but only in things which are known and</p>
<p>perceived; in these alone opinion turns and twists about, and</p>
<p>becomes alternately true and false;-true when the seals and</p>
<p>impressions of sense meet straight and opposite-false when they go</p>
<p>awry and crooked.</p>
<p>Theaet. And is not that, Socrates, nobly said?</p>
<p>Soc. Nobly! yes; but wait a little and hear the explanation, and</p>
<p>then you will say so with more reason; for to think truly is noble and</p>
<p>to be deceived is base.</p>
<p>Theaet. Undoubtedly.</p>
<p>Soc. And the origin of truth and error is as follows:-When the wax</p>
<p>in the soul of any one is deep and abundant, and smooth and</p>
<p>perfectly tempered, then the impressions which pass through the senses</p>
<p>and sink into the heart of the soul, as Homer says in a parable,</p>
<p>meaning to indicate the likeness of the soul to wax (Kerh Kerhos);</p>
<p>these, I say, being pure and clear, and having a sufficient depth of</p>
<p>wax, are also lasting, and minds, such as these, easily learn and</p>
<p>easily retain, and are not liable to confusion, but have true</p>
<p>thoughts, for they have plenty of room, and having clear impressions</p>
<p>of things, as we term them, quickly distribute them into their</p>
<p>proper places on the block. And such men are called wise. Do you</p>
<p>agree?</p>
<p>Theaet. Entirely.</p>
<p>Soc. But when the heart of any one is shaggy-a quality which the</p>
<p>all-wise poet commends, or muddy and of impure wax, or very soft, or</p>
<p>very hard, then there is a corresponding defect in the mind -the</p>
<p>soft are good at learning, but apt to forget; and the hard are the</p>
<p>reverse; the shaggy and rugged and gritty, or those who have an</p>
<p>admixture of earth or dung in their composition, have the</p>
<p>impressions indistinct, as also the hard, for there is no depth in</p>
<p>them; and the soft too are indistinct, for their impressions are</p>
<p>easily confused and effaced. Yet greater is the indistinctness when</p>
<p>they are all jostled together in a little soul, which has no room.</p>
<p>These are the natures which have false opinion; for when they see or</p>
<p>hear or think of anything, they are slow in assigning the right</p>
<p>objects to the right impressions-in their stupidity they confuse them,</p>
<p>and are apt to see and hear and think amiss-and such men are said to</p>
<p>be deceived in their knowledge of objects, and ignorant.</p>
<p>Theaet. No man, Socrates, can say anything truer than that.</p>
<p>Soc. Then now we may admit the existence of false opinion in us?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And of true opinion also?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. We have at length satisfactorily proven beyond a doubt there</p>
<p>are these two sorts of opinion?</p>
<p>Theaet. Undoubtedly.</p>
<p>Soc. Alas, Theaetetus, what a tiresome creature is a man who is fond</p>
<p>of talking!</p>
<p>Theaet. What makes you say so?</p>
<p>Soc. Because I am disheartened at my own stupidity and tiresome</p>
<p>garrulity; for what other term will describe the habit of a man who is</p>
<p>always arguing on all sides of a question; whose dulness cannot be</p>
<p>convinced, and who will never leave off?</p>
<p>Theaet. But what puts you out of heart?</p>
<p>Soc. I am not only out of heart, but in positive despair; for I do</p>
<p>not know what to answer if any one were to ask me:-O Socrates, have</p>
<p>you indeed discovered that false opinion arises neither in the</p>
<p>comparison of perceptions with one another nor yet in thought, but</p>
<p>in union of thought and perception? Yes, I shall say, with the</p>
<p>complacence of one who thinks that he has made a noble discovery.</p>
<p>Theaet. I see no reason why we should be ashamed of our</p>
<p>demonstration, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. He will say: You mean to argue that the man whom we only</p>
<p>think of and do not see, cannot be confused with the horse which we do</p>
<p>not see or touch, but only think of and do not perceive? That I</p>
<p>believe to be my meaning, I shall reply.</p>
<p>Theaet. Quite right.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, then, he will say, according to that argument, the number</p>
<p>eleven, which is only thought, never be mistaken for twelve, which</p>
<p>is only thought: How would you answer him?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should say that a mistake may very likely arise between</p>
<p>the eleven or twelve which are seen or handled, but that no similar</p>
<p>mistake can arise between the eleven and twelve which are in the mind.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, but do you think that no one ever put before his own mind</p>
<p>five and seven, -I do not mean five or seven men or horses, but five</p>
<p>or seven in the abstract, which, as we say, are recorded on the</p>
<p>waxen block, and in which false opinion is held to be impossible;</p>
<p>did no man ever ask himself how many these numbers make when added</p>
<p>together, and answer that they are eleven, while another thinks that</p>
<p>they are twelve, or would all agree in thinking and saying that they</p>
<p>are twelve?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not; many would think that they are eleven, and in</p>
<p>the higher numbers the chance of error is greater still; for I</p>
<p>assume you to be speaking of numbers in general.</p>
<p>Soc. Exactly; and I want you to consider whether this does not imply</p>
<p>that the twelve in the waxen block are supposed to be eleven?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, that seems to be the case.</p>
<p>Soc. Then do we not come back to the old difficulty? For he who</p>
<p>makes such a mistake does think one thing which he knows to be another</p>
<p>thing which he knows; but this, as we said, was impossible, and</p>
<p>afforded an irresistible proof of the non-existence of false</p>
<p>opinion, because otherwise the same person would inevitably know and</p>
<p>not know the same thing at the same time.</p>
<p>Theaet. Most true.</p>
<p>Soc. Then false opinion cannot be explained as a confusion of</p>
<p>thought and sense, for in that case we could not have been mistaken</p>
<p>about pure conceptions of thought; and thus we are obliged to say,</p>
<p>either that false opinion does not exist, or that a man may not know</p>
<p>that which he knows;-which alternative do you prefer?</p>
<p>Theaet. It is hard to determine, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. And yet the argument will scarcely admit of both. But, as we</p>
<p>are at our wits&#x27; end, suppose that we do a shameless thing?</p>
<p>Theaet. What is it?</p>
<p>Soc. Let us attempt to explain the verb &quot;to know.&quot;</p>
<p>Theaet. And why should that be shameless?</p>
<p>Soc. You seem not to be aware that the whole of our discussion</p>
<p>from the very beginning has been a search after knowledge, of which we</p>
<p>are assumed not to know the nature.</p>
<p>Theaet. Nay, but I am well aware.</p>
<p>Soc. And is it not shameless when we do not know what knowledge</p>
<p>is, to be explaining the verb &quot;to know&quot;? The truth is, Theaetetus,</p>
<p>that we have long been infected with logical impurity. Thousands of</p>
<p>times have we repeated the words &quot;we know,&quot; and &quot;do not know,&quot; and &quot;we</p>
<p>have or have not science or knowledge,&quot; as if we could understand what</p>
<p>we are saying to one another, so long as we remain ignorant about</p>
<p>knowledge; and at this moment we are using the words &quot;we</p>
<p>understand,&quot; &quot;we are ignorant,&quot; as though we could still employ them</p>
<p>when deprived of knowledge or science.</p>
<p>Theaet. But if you avoid these expressions, Socrates, how will you</p>
<p>ever argue at all?</p>
<p>Soc. I could not, being the man I am. The case would be different if</p>
<p>I were a true hero of dialectic: and O that such an one were</p>
<p>present! for he would have told us to avoid the use of these terms; at</p>
<p>the same time he would not have spared in you and me the faults</p>
<p>which I have noted. But, seeing that we are no great wits, shall I</p>
<p>venture to say what knowing is? for I think that the attempt may be</p>
<p>worth making.</p>
<p>Theaet. Then by all means venture, and no one shall find fault</p>
<p>with you for using the forbidden terms.</p>
<p>Soc. You have heard the common explanation of the verb &quot;to know&quot;?</p>
<p>Theaet. I think so, but I do not remember it at the moment.</p>
<p>Soc. They explain the word &quot;to know&quot; as meaning &quot;to have knowledge.&quot;</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. I should like to make a slight change, and say &quot;to possess&quot;</p>
<p>knowledge.</p>
<p>Theaet. How do the two expressions differ?</p>
<p>Soc. Perhaps there may be no difference; but still I should like you</p>
<p>to hear my view, that you may help me to test it.</p>
<p>Theaet. I will, if I can.</p>
<p>Soc. I should distinguish &quot;having&quot; from &quot;possessing&quot;: for example, a</p>
<p>man may buy and keep under his control a garment which he does not</p>
<p>wear; and then we should say, not that he has, but that he possesses</p>
<p>the garment.</p>
<p>Theaet. It would be the correct expression.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, may not a man &quot;possess&quot; and yet not &quot;have&quot; knowledge in</p>
<p>the sense of which I am speaking? As you may suppose a man to have</p>
<p>caught wild birds -doves or any other birds-and to be keeping them</p>
<p>in an aviary which he has constructed at home; we might say of him</p>
<p>in one sense, that he always has them because he possesses them, might</p>
<p>we not?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And yet, in another sense, he has none of them; but they are in</p>
<p>his power, and he has got them under his hand in an enclosure of his</p>
<p>own, and can take and have them whenever he likes;-he can catch any</p>
<p>which he likes, and let the bird go again, and he may do so as often</p>
<p>as he pleases.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Once more, then, as in what preceded we made a sort of waxen</p>
<p>figment in the mind, so let us now suppose that in the mind of each</p>
<p>man there is an aviary of all sorts of birds-some flocking together</p>
<p>apart from the rest, others in small groups, others solitary, flying</p>
<p>anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>Theaet. Let us imagine such an aviary-and what is to follow?</p>
<p>Soc. We may suppose that the birds are kinds of knowledge, and</p>
<p>that when we were children, this receptacle was empty; whenever a</p>
<p>man has gotten and detained in the enclosure a kind of knowledge, he</p>
<p>may be said to have learned or discovered the thing which is the</p>
<p>subject of the knowledge: and this is to know.</p>
<p>Theaet. Granted.</p>
<p>Soc. And further, when any one wishes to catch any of these</p>
<p>knowledges or sciences, and having taken, to hold it, and again to let</p>
<p>them go, how will he express himself?-will he describe the</p>
<p>&quot;catching&quot; of them and the original &quot;possession&quot; in the same words?</p>
<p>I will make my meaning clearer by an example:-You admit that there</p>
<p>is an art of arithmetic?</p>
<p>Theaet. To be sure.</p>
<p>Soc. Conceive this under the form of a hunt after the science of odd</p>
<p>and even in general.</p>
<p>Theaet. I follow.</p>
<p>Soc. Having the use of the art, the arithmetician, if I am not</p>
<p>mistaken, has the conceptions of number under his hand, and can</p>
<p>transmit them to another.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And when transmitting them he may be said to teach them, and</p>
<p>when receiving to learn them, and when receiving to learn them, and</p>
<p>when having them in possession in the aforesaid aviary he may be</p>
<p>said to know them.</p>
<p>Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p>Soc. Attend to what follows: must not the perfect arithmetician know</p>
<p>all numbers, for he has the science of all numbers in his mind?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And he can reckon abstract numbers in his head, or things about</p>
<p>him which are numerable?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course he can.</p>
<p>Soc. And to reckon is simply to consider how much such and such a</p>
<p>number amounts to?</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. And so he appears to be searching into something which he</p>
<p>knows, as if he did not know it, for we have already admitted that</p>
<p>he knows all numbers;-you have heard these perplexing questions</p>
<p>raised?</p>
<p>Theaet. I have.</p>
<p>Soc. May we not pursue the image of the doves, and say that the</p>
<p>chase after knowledge is of two kinds? one kind is prior to possession</p>
<p>and for the sake of possession, and the other for the sake of taking</p>
<p>and holding in the hands that which is possessed already. And thus,</p>
<p>when a man has learned and known something long ago, he may resume and</p>
<p>get hold of the knowledge which he has long possessed, but has not</p>
<p>at hand in his mind.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. That was my reason for asking how we ought to speak when an</p>
<p>arithmetician sets about numbering, or a grammarian about reading?</p>
<p>Shall we say, that although he knows, he comes back to himself to</p>
<p>learn what he already knows?</p>
<p>Theaet. It would be too absurd, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. Shall we say then that he is going to read or number what he</p>
<p>does not know, although we have admitted that he knows all letters and</p>
<p>all numbers?</p>
<p>Theaet. That, again, would be an absurdity.</p>
<p>Soc. Then shall we say that about names we care nothing?-any one may</p>
<p>twist and turn the words &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; in any way which</p>
<p>he likes, but since we have determined that the possession of</p>
<p>knowledge is not the having or using it, we do assert that a man</p>
<p>cannot not possess that which he possesses; and, therefore, in no case</p>
<p>can a man not know that which he knows, but he may get a false opinion</p>
<p>about it; for he may have the knowledge, not of this particular thing,</p>
<p>but of some other;-when the various numbers and forms of knowledge are</p>
<p>flying about in the aviary, and wishing to capture a certain sort of</p>
<p>knowledge out of the general store, he takes the wrong one by mistake,</p>
<p>that is to say, when he thought eleven to be twelve, he got hold of</p>
<p>the ringdove which he had in his mind, when he wanted the pigeon.</p>
<p>Theaet. A very rational explanation.</p>
<p>Soc. But when he catches the one which he wants, then he is not</p>
<p>deceived, and has an opinion of what is, and thus false and true</p>
<p>opinion may exist, and the difficulties which were previously raised</p>
<p>disappear. I dare say that you agree with me, do you not?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And so we are rid of the difficulty of a man&#x27;s not knowing what</p>
<p>he knows, for we are not driven to the inference that he does not</p>
<p>possess what he possesses, whether he be or be not deceived. And yet I</p>
<p>fear that a greater difficulty is looking in at the window.</p>
<p>Theaet. What is it?</p>
<p>Soc. How can the exchange of one knowledge for another ever become</p>
<p>false opinion?</p>
<p>Theaet. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Soc. In the first place, how can a man who has the knowledge of</p>
<p>anything be ignorant of that which he knows, not by reason of</p>
<p>ignorance, but by reason of his own knowledge? And, again, is it not</p>
<p>an extreme absurdity that he should suppose another thing to be</p>
<p>this, and this to be another thing;-that, having knowledge present</p>
<p>with him in his mind, he should still know nothing and be ignorant</p>
<p>of all things?-you might as well argue that ignorance may make a man</p>
<p>know, and blindness make him see, as that knowledge can make him</p>
<p>ignorant.</p>
<p>Theaet. Perhaps, Socrates, we may have been wrong in making only</p>
<p>forms of knowledge our birds: whereas there ought to have been forms</p>
<p>of ignorance as well, flying about together in the mind, and then he</p>
<p>who sought to take one of them might sometimes catch a form of</p>
<p>knowledge, and sometimes a form of ignorance; and thus he would have a</p>
<p>false opinion from ignorance, but a true one from knowledge, about the</p>
<p>same thing.</p>
<p>Soc. I cannot help praising you, Theaetetus, and yet I must beg</p>
<p>you to reconsider your words. Let us grant what you say-then,</p>
<p>according to you, he who takes ignorance will have a false</p>
<p>opinion-am I right?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. He will certainly not think that he has a false opinion?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course not.</p>
<p>Soc. He will think that his opinion is true, and he will fancy</p>
<p>that he knows the things about which he has been deceived?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Then he will think that he has captured knowledge and not</p>
<p>ignorance?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. And thus, after going a long way round, we are once more face</p>
<p>to face with our original difficulty. The hero of dialectic will</p>
<p>retort upon us:-&quot;O my excellent friends, he will say, laughing, if a</p>
<p>man knows the form of ignorance and the form of knowledge, can he</p>
<p>think that one of them which he knows is the other which he knows? or,</p>
<p>if he knows neither of them, can he think that the one which he</p>
<p>knows not is another which he knows not? or, if he knows one and not</p>
<p>the other, can he think the one which he knows to be the one which</p>
<p>he does not know? or the one which he does not know to be the one</p>
<p>which he knows? or will you tell me that there are other forms of</p>
<p>knowledge which distinguish the right and wrong birds, and which the</p>
<p>owner keeps in some other aviaries or graven on waxen blocks according</p>
<p>to your foolish images, and which he may be said to know while he</p>
<p>possesses them, even though he have them not at hand in his mind?</p>
<p>And thus, in a perpetual circle, you will be compelled to go round and</p>
<p>round, and you will make no progress.&quot; What are we to say in reply,</p>
<p>Theaetetus?</p>
<p>Theaet. Indeed, Socrates, I do not know what we are to say.</p>
<p>Soc. Are not his reproaches just, and does not the argument truly</p>
<p>show that we are wrong in seeking for false opinion until we know what</p>
<p>knowledge is; that must be first ascertained; then, the nature of</p>
<p>false opinion?</p>
<p>Theaet. I cannot but agree with you, Socrates, so far as we have yet</p>
<p>gone.</p>
<p>Soc. Then, once more, what shall we say that knowledge is?-for we</p>
<p>are not going to lose heart as yet.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly, I shall not lose heart, if you do not.</p>
<p>Soc. What definition will be most consistent with our former views?</p>
<p>Theaet. I cannot think of any but our old one, Socrates.</p>
<p>Soc. What was it?</p>
<p>Theaet. Knowledge was said by us to be true opinion; and true</p>
<p>opinion is surely unerring, and the results which follow from it are</p>
<p>all noble and good.</p>
<p>Soc. He who led the way into the river, Theaetetus, said &quot;The</p>
<p>experiment will show&quot;; and perhaps if we go forward in the search,</p>
<p>we may stumble upon the thing which we are looking for; but if we stay</p>
<p>where we are, nothing will come to light.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true; let us go forward and try.</p>
<p>Soc. The trail soon comes to an end, for a whole profession is</p>
<p>against us.</p>
<p>Theaet. How is that, and what profession do you mean?</p>
<p>Soc. The profession of the great wise ones who are called orators</p>
<p>and lawyers; for these persuade men by their art and make them think</p>
<p>whatever they like, but they do not teach them. Do you imagine that</p>
<p>there are any teachers in the world so clever as to be able to</p>
<p>convince others of the truth about acts of robbery or violence, of</p>
<p>which they were not eyewitnesses, while a little water is flowing in</p>
<p>the clepsydra?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not, they can only persuade them.</p>
<p>Soc. And would you not say that persuading them is making them</p>
<p>have an opinion?</p>
<p>Theaet. To be sure.</p>
<p>Soc. When, therefore, judges are justly persuaded about matters</p>
<p>which you can know only by seeing them, and not in any other way,</p>
<p>and when thus judging of them from report they attain a true opinion</p>
<p>about them, they judge without knowledge and yet are rightly</p>
<p>persuaded, if they have judged well.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And yet, O my friend, if true opinion in law courts and</p>
<p>knowledge are the same, the perfect judge could not have judged</p>
<p>rightly without knowledge; and therefore I must infer that they are</p>
<p>not the same.</p>
<p>Theaet. That is a distinction, Socrates, which I have heard made</p>
<p>by some one else, but I had forgotten it. He said that true opinion,</p>
<p>combined with reason, was knowledge, but that the opinion which had no</p>
<p>reason was out of the sphere of knowledge; and that things of which</p>
<p>there is no rational account are not knowable-such was the singular</p>
<p>expression which he used-and that things which have a reason or</p>
<p>explanation are knowable.</p>
<p>Soc. Excellent; but then, how did he distinguish between things</p>
<p>which are and are not &quot;knowable&quot;? I wish that you would repeat to me</p>
<p>what he said, and then I shall know whether you and I have heard the</p>
<p>same tale.</p>
<p>Theaet. I do not know whether I can recall it; but if another person</p>
<p>would tell me, I think that I could follow him.</p>
<p>Soc. Let me give you, then, a dream in return for a dream:-Methought</p>
<p>that I too had a dream, and I heard in my dream that the primeval</p>
<p>letters or elements out of which you and I and all other things are</p>
<p>compounded, have no reason or explanation; you can only name them, but</p>
<p>no predicate can be either affirmed or denied of them, for in the</p>
<p>one case existence, in the other non-existence is already implied,</p>
<p>neither of which must be added, if you mean to speak of this or that</p>
<p>thing by itself alone. It should not be called itself, or that, or</p>
<p>each, or alone, or this, or the like; for these go about everywhere</p>
<p>and are applied to all things, but are distinct from them; whereas, if</p>
<p>the first elements could be described, and had a definition of their</p>
<p>own, they would be spoken of apart from all else. But none of these</p>
<p>primeval elements can be defined; they can only be named, for they</p>
<p>have nothing but a name, and the things which are compounded of</p>
<p>them, as they are complex, are expressed by a combination of names,</p>
<p>for the combination of names is the essence of a definition. Thus,</p>
<p>then, the elements or letters are only objects of perception, and</p>
<p>cannot be defined or known; but the syllables or combinations of</p>
<p>them are known and expressed, and are apprehended by true opinion.</p>
<p>When, therefore, any one forms the true opinion of anything without</p>
<p>rational explanation, you may say that his mind is truly exercised,</p>
<p>but has no knowledge; for he who cannot give and receive a reason</p>
<p>for a thing, has no knowledge of that thing; but when he adds rational</p>
<p>explanation, then, he is perfected in knowledge and may be all that</p>
<p>I have been denying of him. Was that the form in which the dream</p>
<p>appeared to you?</p>
<p>Theaet. Precisely.</p>
<p>Soc. And you allow and maintain that true opinion, combined with</p>
<p>definition or rational explanation, is knowledge?</p>
<p>Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p>Soc. Then may we assume, Theaetetus, that to-day, and in this casual</p>
<p>manner, we have found a truth which in former times many wise men have</p>
<p>grown old and have not found?</p>
<p>Theaet. At any rate, Socrates, I am satisfied with the present</p>
<p>statement.</p>
<p>Soc. Which is probably correct-for how can there be knowledge</p>
<p>apart from definition and true opinion? And yet there is one point</p>
<p>in what has been said which does not quite satisfy me.</p>
<p>Theaet. What was it?</p>
<p>Soc. What might seem to be the most ingenious notion of all:-That</p>
<p>the elements or letters are unknown, but the combination or</p>
<p>syllables known.</p>
<p>Theaet. And was that wrong?</p>
<p>Soc. We shall soon know; for we have as hostages the instances which</p>
<p>the author of the argument himself used.</p>
<p>Theaet. What hostages?</p>
<p>Soc. The letters, which are the clements; and the syllables, which</p>
<p>are the combinations;-he reasoned, did he not, from the letters of the</p>
<p>alphabet?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes; he did.</p>
<p>Soc. Let us take them and put them to the test, or rather, test</p>
<p>ourselves:-What was the way in which we learned letters? and, first of</p>
<p>all, are we right in saying that syllables have a definition, but that</p>
<p>letters have no definition?</p>
<p>Theaet. I think so.</p>
<p>Soc. I think so too; for, suppose that some one asks you to spell</p>
<p>the first syllable of my name:-Theaetetus, he says, what is SO?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should reply S and O.</p>
<p>Soc. That is the definition which you would give of the syllable?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should.</p>
<p>Soc. I wish that you would give me a similar definition of the S.</p>
<p>Theaet. But how can any one, Socrates, tell the elements of an</p>
<p>element? I can only reply, that S is a consonant, a mere noise, as</p>
<p>of the tongue hissing; B, and most other letters, again, are neither</p>
<p>vowel-sounds nor noises. Thus letters may be most truly said to be</p>
<p>undefined; for even the most distinct of them, which are the seven</p>
<p>vowels, have a sound only, but no definition at all.</p>
<p>Soc. Then, I suppose, my friend, that we have been so far right in</p>
<p>our idea about knowledge?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes; I think that we have.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, but have we been right in maintaining that the</p>
<p>syllables can be known, but not the letters?</p>
<p>Theaet. I think so.</p>
<p>Soc. And do we mean by a syllable two letters, or if there are more,</p>
<p>all of them, or a single idea which arises out of the combination of</p>
<p>them?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should say that we mean all the letters.</p>
<p>Soc. Take the case of the two letters S and O, which form the</p>
<p>first syllable of my own name; must not he who knows the syllable,</p>
<p>know both of them?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. He knows, that is, the S and O?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. But can he be ignorant of either singly and yet know both</p>
<p>together?</p>
<p>Theaet. Such a supposition, Socrates, is monstrous and unmeaning.</p>
<p>Soc. But if he cannot know both without knowing each, then if he</p>
<p>is ever to know the syllable, he must know the letters first; and thus</p>
<p>the fine theory has again taken wings and departed.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, with wonderful celerity.</p>
<p>Soc. Yes, we did not keep watch properly. Perhaps we ought to have</p>
<p>maintained that a syllable is not the letters, but rather one single</p>
<p>idea framed out of them, having a separate form distinct from them.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true; and a more likely notion than the other.</p>
<p>Soc. Take care; let us not be cowards and betray a great and</p>
<p>imposing theory.</p>
<p>Theaet. No, indeed.</p>
<p>Soc. Let us assume then, as we now say, that the syllable is a</p>
<p>simple form arising out of the several combinations of harmonious</p>
<p>elements-of letters or of any other elements.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very good.</p>
<p>Soc. And it must have no parts.</p>
<p>Theaet. Why?</p>
<p>Soc. Because that which has parts must be a whole of all the</p>
<p>parts. Or would you say that a whole, although formed out of the</p>
<p>parts, is a single notion different from all the parts?</p>
<p>Theaet. I should.</p>
<p>Soc. And would you say that all and the whole are the same, or</p>
<p>different?</p>
<p>Theaet. I am not certain; but, as you like me to answer at once, I</p>
<p>shall hazard the reply, that they are different.</p>
<p>Soc. I approve of your readiness, Theaetetus, but I must take time</p>
<p>to think whether I equally approve of your answer.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes; the answer is the point.</p>
<p>Soc. According to this new view, the whole is supposed to differ</p>
<p>from all?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, but is there any difference between all [in the plural]</p>
<p>and the all [in the singular]? Take the case of number:-When we say</p>
<p>one, two, three, four, five, six; or when we say twice three, or three</p>
<p>times two, or four and two, or three and two and one, are we</p>
<p>speaking of the same or of different numbers?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of the same.</p>
<p>Soc. That is of six?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And in each form of expression we spoke of all the six?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Again, in speaking of all [in the plural] is there not one</p>
<p>thing which we express?</p>
<p>Theaet. Of course there is.</p>
<p>Soc. And that is six?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. Then in predicating the word &quot;all&quot; of things measured by</p>
<p>number, we predicate at the same time a singular and a plural?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly we do.</p>
<p>Soc. Again, the number of the acre and the acre are the same; are</p>
<p>they not?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And the number of the stadium in like manner is the stadium?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And the army is the number of the army; and in all similar</p>
<p>cases, the entire number of anything is the entire thing?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And the number of each is the parts of each?</p>
<p>Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p>Soc. Then as many things as have parts are made up of parts?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. But all the parts are admitted to be the all, if the entire</p>
<p>number is the all?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Then the whole is not made up of parts, for it would be the</p>
<p>all, if consisting of all the parts?</p>
<p>Theaet. That is the inference.</p>
<p>Soc. But is a part a part of anything but the whole?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes, of the all.</p>
<p>Soc. You make a valiant defence, Theaetetus. And yet is not the</p>
<p>all that of which nothing is wanting?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And is not a whole likewise that from which nothing is</p>
<p>absent? but that from which anything is absent is neither a whole</p>
<p>nor all;-if wanting in anything, both equally lose their entirety of</p>
<p>nature.</p>
<p>Theaet. I now think that there is no difference between a whole</p>
<p>and all.</p>
<p>Soc. But were we not saying that when a thing has parts, all the</p>
<p>parts will be a whole and all?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Then, as I was saying before, must not the alternative be</p>
<p>that either the syllable is not the letters, and then the letters</p>
<p>are not parts of the syllable, or that the syllable will be the same</p>
<p>with the letters, and will therefore be equally known with them?</p>
<p>Theaet. You are right.</p>
<p>Soc. And, in order to avoid this, we suppose it to be different from</p>
<p>them?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. But if letters are not parts of syllables, can you tell me of</p>
<p>any other parts of syllables, which are not letters?</p>
<p>Theaet. No, indeed, Socrates; for if I admit the existence of</p>
<p>parts in a syllable, it would be ridiculous in me to give up letters</p>
<p>and seek for other parts.</p>
<p>Soc. Quite true, Theaetetus, and therefore, according to our present</p>
<p>view, a syllable must surely be some indivisible form?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. But do you remember, my friend, that only a little while ago we</p>
<p>admitted and approved the statement, that of the first elements out of</p>
<p>which all other things are compounded there could be no definition,</p>
<p>because each of them when taken by itself is uncompounded; nor can one</p>
<p>rightly attribute to them the words &quot;being&quot; or &quot;this,&quot; because they</p>
<p>are alien and inappropriate words, and for this reason the letters</p>
<p>or clements were indefinable and unknown?</p>
<p>Theaet. I remember.</p>
<p>Soc. And is not this also the reason why they are simple and</p>
<p>indivisible? I can see no other.</p>
<p>Theaet. No other reason can be given.</p>
<p>Soc. Then is not the syllable in the same case as the elements or</p>
<p>letters, if it has no parts and is one form?</p>
<p>Theaet. To be sure.</p>
<p>Soc. If, then, a syllable is a whole, and has many parts or letters,</p>
<p>the letters as well as the syllable must be intelligible and</p>
<p>expressible, since all the parts are acknowledged to be the same as</p>
<p>the whole?</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. But if it be one and indivisible, then the syllables and the</p>
<p>letters are alike undefined and unknown, and for the same reason?</p>
<p>Theaet. I cannot deny that.</p>
<p>Soc. We cannot, therefore, agree in the opinion of him who says that</p>
<p>the syllable can be known and expressed, but not the letters.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not; if we may trust the argument.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, but will you not be equally inclined to, disagree with</p>
<p>him, when you remember your own experience in learning to read?</p>
<p>Theaet. What experience?</p>
<p>Soc. Why, that in learning you were kept trying to distinguish the</p>
<p>separate letters both by the eye and by the car, in order that, when</p>
<p>you heard them spoken or saw them written, you might not be confused</p>
<p>by their position.</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. And is the education of the harp-player complete unless he</p>
<p>can tell what string answers to a particular note; the notes, as every</p>
<p>one would allow, are the elements or letters of music?</p>
<p>Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p>Soc. Then, if we argue from the letters and syllables which we</p>
<p>know to other simples and compounds, we shall say that the letters</p>
<p>or simple clements as a class are much more certainly known than the</p>
<p>syllables, and much more indispensable to a perfect knowledge of any</p>
<p>subject; and if some one says that the syllable is known and the</p>
<p>letter unknown, we shall consider that either intentionally or</p>
<p>unintentionally he is talking nonsense?</p>
<p>Theaet. Exactly.</p>
<p>Soc. And there might be given other proofs of this belief, if I am</p>
<p>not mistaken. But do not let us in looking for them lose sight of</p>
<p>the question before us, which is the meaning of the statement, that</p>
<p>right opinion with rational definition or explanation is the most</p>
<p>perfect form of knowledge.</p>
<p>Theaet. We must not.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, and what is the meaning of the term &quot;explanation&quot;? I</p>
<p>think that we have a choice of three meanings.</p>
<p>Theaet. What are they?</p>
<p>Soc. In the first place, the meaning may be, manifesting one&#x27;s</p>
<p>thought by the voice with verbs and nouns, imaging an opinion in the</p>
<p>stream which flows from the lips, as in a mirror or water. Does not</p>
<p>explanation appear to be of this nature?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly; he who so manifests his thought, is said to</p>
<p>explain himself.</p>
<p>Soc. And every one who is not born deaf or dumb is able sooner or</p>
<p>later to manifest what he thinks of anything; and if so, all those who</p>
<p>have a right opinion about anything will also have right</p>
<p>explanation; nor will right opinion be anywhere found to exist apart</p>
<p>from knowledge.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Let us not, therefore, hastily charge him who gave this account</p>
<p>of knowledge with uttering an unmeaning word; for perhaps he only</p>
<p>intended to say, that when a person was asked what was the nature of</p>
<p>anything, he should be able to answer his questioner by giving the</p>
<p>clements of the thing.</p>
<p>Theaet. As for example, Socrates...?</p>
<p>Soc. As, for example, when Hesiod says that a waggon is made up of a</p>
<p>hundred planks. Now, neither you nor I could describe all of them</p>
<p>individually; but if any one asked what is a waggon, we should be</p>
<p>content to answer, that a waggon consists of wheels, axle, body, rims,</p>
<p>yoke.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And our opponent will probably laugh at us, just as he would if</p>
<p>we professed to be grammarians and to give a grammatical account of</p>
<p>the name of Theaetetus, and yet could only tell the syllables and</p>
<p>not the letters of your name-that would be true opinion, and not</p>
<p>knowledge; for knowledge, as has been already remarked, is not</p>
<p>attained until, combined with true opinion, there is an enumeration of</p>
<p>the elements out of which is composed.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. In the same general way, we might also have true opinion</p>
<p>about a waggon; but he who can describe its essence by an</p>
<p>enumeration of the hundred planks, adds rational explanation to true</p>
<p>opinion, and instead of opinion has art and knowledge of the nature of</p>
<p>a waggon, in that he attains to the whole through the elements.</p>
<p>Theaet. And do. you not agree in that view, Socrates?</p>
<p>Soc. If you do, my friend; but I want to know first, whether you</p>
<p>admit the resolution of all things into their elements to be a</p>
<p>rational explanation of them, and the consideration of them in</p>
<p>syllables or larger combinations of them to be irrational-is this your</p>
<p>view?</p>
<p>Theaet. Precisely.</p>
<p>Soc. Well, and do you conceive that a man has knowledge of any</p>
<p>element who at one time affirms and at another time denies that</p>
<p>clement of something, or thinks that. the same thing is composed of</p>
<p>different elements at different times?</p>
<p>Theaet. Assuredly not.</p>
<p>Soc. And do you not remember that in your case and in of others this</p>
<p>often occurred in the process of learning to read?</p>
<p>Theaet. You mean that I mistook the letters and misspelt the</p>
<p>syllables?</p>
<p>Soc. Yes.</p>
<p>Theaet. To be sure; I perfectly remember, and I am very far from</p>
<p>supposing that they who are in this condition, have knowledge.</p>
<p>Soc. When a person, at the time of learning writes the name of</p>
<p>Theaetetus, and thinks that he ought to write and does write Th and e;</p>
<p>but, again meaning to write the name of Theododorus, thinks that he</p>
<p>ought to write and does write T and e-can we suppose that he knows the</p>
<p>first syllables of your two names?</p>
<p>Theaet. We have already admitted that such a one has not yet</p>
<p>attained knowledge.</p>
<p>Soc. And in like manner be may enumerate without knowing them the</p>
<p>second and third and fourth syllables of your name?</p>
<p>Theaet. He may.</p>
<p>Soc. And in that case, when he knows the order of the letters and</p>
<p>can write them out correctly, he has right opinion?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. But although we admit that he has right opinion, he will</p>
<p>still be without knowledge?</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And yet he will have explanations, as well as right opinion,</p>
<p>for he knew the order of the letters when he wrote; and this we</p>
<p>admit be explanation.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Then, my friend, there is such a thing as right opinion</p>
<p>united with definition or explanation, which does not as yet attain to</p>
<p>the exactness of knowledge.</p>
<p>Theaet. It would seem so.</p>
<p>Soc. And what we fancied to be a perfect definition of knowledge</p>
<p>is a dream only. But perhaps we had better not say so as yet, for were</p>
<p>there not three explanations of knowledge, one of which must, as we</p>
<p>said, be adopted by him who maintains knowledge to be true opinion</p>
<p>combined with rational explanation? And very likely there may be found</p>
<p>some one who will not prefer this but the third.</p>
<p>Theaet. You are quite right; there is still one remaining. The first</p>
<p>was the image or expression of the mind in speech; the second, which</p>
<p>has just been mentioned, is a way of reaching the whole by an</p>
<p>enumeration of the elements. But what is; the third definition?</p>
<p>Soc. There is, further, the popular notion of telling the mark or</p>
<p>sign of difference which distinguishes the thing in question from</p>
<p>all others.</p>
<p>Theaet. Can you give me any example of such a definition?</p>
<p>Soc. As, for example, in the case of the sun, I think that you would</p>
<p>be contented with the statement that the sun is, the brightest of</p>
<p>the heavenly bodies which revolve about the earth.</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. Understand why:-the reason is, as I was just now saying, that</p>
<p>if you get at the difference and distinguishing characteristic of each</p>
<p>thing, then, as many persons affirm, you will get at the definition or</p>
<p>explanation of it; but while you lay hold only of the common and not</p>
<p>of the characteristic notion, you will only have the definition of</p>
<p>those things to which this common quality belongs.</p>
<p>Theaet. I understand you, and your account of definition is in my</p>
<p>judgment correct.</p>
<p>Soc. But he, who having right opinion about anything, can find out</p>
<p>the difference which distinguishes it from other things will know that</p>
<p>of which before he had only an opinion.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes; that is what we are maintaining.</p>
<p>Soc. Nevertheless, Theaetetus, on a nearer view, I find myself quite</p>
<p>disappointed; the picture, which at a distance was not so bad, has now</p>
<p>become altogether unintelligible.</p>
<p>Theaet. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Soc. I will endeavour to explain: I will suppose myself to have true</p>
<p>opinion of you, and if to this I add your definition, then I have</p>
<p>knowledge, but if not, opinion only.</p>
<p>Theaet. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. The definition was assumed to be the interpretation of your</p>
<p>difference.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. But when I had only opinion, I had no conception of your</p>
<p>distinguishing characteristics.</p>
<p>Theaet. I suppose not.</p>
<p>Soc. Then I must have conceived of some general or common nature</p>
<p>which no more belonged to you than to another.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Tell me, now-How in that case could I have formed a judgment of</p>
<p>you any more than of any one else? Suppose that I imagine Theaetetus</p>
<p>to be a man who has nose, eyes, and mouth, and every other member</p>
<p>complete; how would that enable me to distinguish Theaetetus from</p>
<p>Theodorus, or from some outer barbarian?</p>
<p>Theaet. How could it?</p>
<p>Soc. Or if I had further conceived of you, not only as having nose</p>
<p>and eyes, but as having a snub nose and prominent eyes, should I</p>
<p>have any more notion of you than of myself and others who resemble me?</p>
<p>Theaet. Certainly not.</p>
<p>Soc. Surely I can have no conception of Theaetetus until your</p>
<p>snub-nosedness has left an impression on my mind different from the</p>
<p>snub-nosedness of all others whom I have ever seen, and until your</p>
<p>other peculiarities have a like distinctness; and so when I meet you</p>
<p>tomorrow the right opinion will be re-called?</p>
<p>Theaet. Most true.</p>
<p>Soc. Then right opinion implies the perception of differences?</p>
<p>Theaet. Clearly.</p>
<p>Soc. What, then, shall we say of adding reason or explanation to</p>
<p>right opinion? If the meaning is, that we should form an opinion of</p>
<p>the way in which something differs from another thing, the proposal is</p>
<p>ridiculous.</p>
<p>Theaet. How so?</p>
<p>Soc. We are supposed to acquire a right opinion of the differences</p>
<p>which distinguish one thing from another when we have already a</p>
<p>right opinion of them, and so we go round and round:-the revolution of</p>
<p>the scytal, or pestle, or any other rotatory machine, in the same</p>
<p>circles, is as nothing compared with such a requirement; and we may be</p>
<p>truly described as the blind directing the blind; for to add those</p>
<p>things which we already have, in order that we may learn what we</p>
<p>already think, is like a soul utterly benighted.</p>
<p>Theaet. Tell me; what were you going to say just now, when you asked</p>
<p>the question?</p>
<p>Soc. If, my boy, the argument, in speaking of adding the definition,</p>
<p>had used the word to &quot;know,&quot; and not merely &quot;have an opinion&quot; of the</p>
<p>difference, this which is the most promising of all the definitions of</p>
<p>knowledge would have come to a pretty end, for to know is surely to</p>
<p>acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>Theaet. True.</p>
<p>Soc. And so, when the question is asked, What is knowledge? this</p>
<p>fair argument will answer &quot;Right opinion with knowledge,&quot;-knowledge,</p>
<p>that is, of difference, for this, as the said argument maintains, is</p>
<p>adding the definition.</p>
<p>Theaet. That seems to be true.</p>
<p>Soc. But how utterly foolish, when we are asking what is</p>
<p>knowledge, that the reply should only be, right opinion with knowledge</p>
<p>of difference or of anything! And so, Theaetetus, knowledge is neither</p>
<p>sensation nor true opinion, nor yet definition and explanation</p>
<p>accompanying and added to true opinion?</p>
<p>Theaet. I suppose not.</p>
<p>Soc. And are you still in labour and travail, my dear friend, or</p>
<p>have you brought all that you have to say about knowledge to the</p>
<p>birth?</p>
<p>Theaet. I am sure, Socrates, that you have elicited from me a good</p>
<p>deal more than ever was in me.</p>
<p>Soc. And does not my art show that you have brought forth wind,</p>
<p>and that the offspring of your brain are not worth bringing up?</p>
<p>Theaet. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. But if, Theaetetus, you should ever conceive afresh, you will</p>
<p>be all the better for the present investigation, and if not, you</p>
<p>will be soberer and humbler and gentler to other men, and will be</p>
<p>too modest to fancy that you know what you do not know. These are</p>
<p>the limits of my art; I can no further go, nor do I know aught of</p>
<p>the things which great and famous men know or have known in this or</p>
<p>former ages. The office of a midwife I, like my mother, have</p>
<p>received from God; she delivered women, I deliver men; but they must</p>
<p>be young and noble and fair.</p>
<p>And now I have to go to the porch of the King Archon, where I am</p>
<p>to meet Meletus and his indictment. To-morrow morning, Theodorus, I</p>
<p>shall hope to see you again at this place.</p>
