Bunyan</h1></header><p>The Life of John Bunyan</p>
<p>by Edmund Venables, M.A.</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<p>John Bunyan, the author of the book which has probably passed</p>
<p>through more editions, had a greater number of readers, and been</p>
<p>translated into more languages than any other book in the English</p>
<p>tongue, was born in the parish of Elstow, in Bedfordshire, in the</p>
<p>latter part of the year 1628, and was baptized in the parish church</p>
<p>of the village on the last day of November of that year.</p>
<p>The year of John Bunyan&#x27;s birth was a momentous one both for the</p>
<p>nation and for the Church of England.  Charles I., by the extorted</p>
<p>assent to the Petition of Right, had begun reluctantly to strip</p>
<p>himself of the irresponsible authority he had claimed, and had</p>
<p>taken the first step in the struggle between King and Parliament</p>
<p>which ended in the House of Commons seating itself in the place of</p>
<p>the Sovereign.  Wentworth (better known as Lord Strafford) had</p>
<p>finally left the Commons, baffled in his nobly-conceived but vain</p>
<p>hope of reconciling the monarch and his people, and having accepted</p>
<p>a peerage and the promise of the Presidency of the Council of the</p>
<p>North, was foreshadowing his policy of &quot;Thorough,&quot; which was</p>
<p>destined to bring both his own head and that of his weak master to</p>
<p>the block.  The Remonstrance of Parliament against the toleration</p>
<p>of Roman Catholics and the growth of Arminianism, had been</p>
<p>presented to the indignant king, who, wilfully blinded, had replied</p>
<p>to it by the promotion to high and lucrative posts in the Church of</p>
<p>the very men against whom it was chiefly directed.  The most</p>
<p>outrageous upholders of the royal prerogative and the irresponsible</p>
<p>power of the sovereign, Montagu and Mainwaring, had been presented,</p>
<p>the one to the see of Chichester, the other - the impeached and</p>
<p>condemned of the Commons - to the rich living Montagu&#x27;s</p>
<p>consecration had vacated.  Montaigne, the licenser of Mainwaring&#x27;s</p>
<p>incriminated sermon, was raised to the Archbishopric of York, while</p>
<p>Neile and Laud, who were openly named in the Remonstrance as the</p>
<p>&quot;troublers of the English Israel,&quot; were rewarded respectively with</p>
<p>the rich see of Durham and the important and deeply-dyed Puritan</p>
<p>diocese of London.  Charles was steadily sowing the wind, and</p>
<p>destined to reap the whirlwind which was to sweep him from his</p>
<p>throne, and involve the monarchy and the Church in the same</p>
<p>overthrow.  Three months before Bunyan&#x27;s birth Buckingham, on the</p>
<p>eve of his departure for the beleaguered and famine-stricken city</p>
<p>of Rochelle, sanguinely hoping to conclude a peace with the French</p>
<p>king beneath its walls, had been struck down by the knife of a</p>
<p>fanatic, to the undisguised joy of the majority of the nation,</p>
<p>bequeathing a legacy of failure and disgrace in the fall of the</p>
<p>Protestant stronghold on which the eyes of Europe had been so long</p>
<p>anxiously fixed.</p>
<p>The year was closing gloomily, with ominous forecasts of the coming</p>
<p>hurricane, when the babe who was destined to leave so imperishable</p>
<p>a name in English literature, first saw the light in an humble</p>
<p>cottage in an obscure Bedfordshire village.  His father, Thomas</p>
<p>Bunyan, though styling himself in his will by the more dignified</p>
<p>title of &quot;brazier,&quot; was more properly what is known as a &quot;tinker&quot;;</p>
<p>&quot;a mender of pots and kettles,&quot; according to Bunyan&#x27;s contemporary</p>
<p>biographer, Charles Doe.  He was not, however, a mere tramp or</p>
<p>vagrant, as travelling tinkers were and usually are still, much</p>
<p>less a disreputable sot, a counterpart of Shakespeare&#x27;s Christopher</p>
<p>Sly, but a man with a recognized calling, having a settled home and</p>
<p>an acknowledged position in the village community of Elstow.  The</p>
<p>family was of long standing there, but had for some generations</p>
<p>been going down in the world.  Bunyan&#x27;s grandfather, Thomas Bunyan,</p>
<p>as we learn from his still extant will, carried on the occupation</p>
<p>of a &quot;petty chapman,&quot; or small retail dealer, in his own freehold</p>
<p>cottage, which he bequeathed, &quot;with its appurtenances,&quot; to his</p>
<p>second wife, Ann, to descend, after her death, to her stepson, his</p>
<p>namesake, Thomas, and her own son Edward, in equal shares.  This</p>
<p>cottage, which was probably John Bunyan&#x27;s birthplace, persistent</p>
<p>tradition, confirmed by the testimony of local names, warrants us</p>
<p>in placing near the hamlet of Harrowden, a mile to the east of the</p>
<p>village of Elstow, at a place long called &quot;Bunyan&#x27;s End,&quot; where two</p>
<p>fields are still called by the name of &quot;Bunyans&quot; and &quot;Further</p>
<p>Bunyans.&quot;  This small freehold appears to have been all that</p>
<p>remained, at the death of John Bunyan&#x27;s grandfather, of a property</p>
<p>once considerable enough to have given the name of its possessor to</p>
<p>the whole locality.</p>
<p>The family of Buingnon, Bunyun, Buniun, Boynon, Bonyon, or Binyan</p>
<p>(the name is found spelt in no fewer than thirty-four different</p>
<p>ways, of which the now-established form, Bunyan, is almost the</p>
<p>least frequent) is one that had established itself in Bedfordshire</p>
<p>from very early times.  The first place in connection with which</p>
<p>the name appears is Pulloxhill, about nine miles from Elstow.  In</p>
<p>1199, the year of King John&#x27;s accession, the Bunyans had approached</p>
<p>still nearer to that parish.  One William Bunion held land at</p>
<p>Wilstead, not more than a mile off.  In 1327, the first year of</p>
<p>Edward III., one of the same name, probably his descendant, William</p>
<p>Boynon, is found actually living at Harrowden, close to the spot</p>
<p>which popular tradition names as John Bunyan&#x27;s birthplace, and was</p>
<p>the owner of property there.  We have no further notices of the</p>
<p>Bunyans of Elstow till the sixteenth century.  We then find them</p>
<p>greatly fallen.  Their ancestral property seems little by little to</p>
<p>have passed into other hands, until in 1542 nothing was left but &quot;a</p>
<p>messuage and pightell (1) with the appurtenances, and nine acres of</p>
<p>land.&quot;  This small residue other entries on the Court Rolls show to</p>
<p>have been still further diminished by sale.  The field already</p>
<p>referred to, known as &quot;Bonyon&#x27;s End,&quot; was sold by &quot;Thomas Bonyon,</p>
<p>of Elstow, labourer,&quot; son of William Bonyon, the said Thomas and</p>
<p>his wife being the keepers of a small road-side inn, at which their</p>
<p>overcharges for their home-baked bread and home-brewed beer were</p>
<p>continually bringing them into trouble with the petty local courts</p>
<p>of the day.  Thomas Bunyan, John Bunyan&#x27;s father, was born in the</p>
<p>last days of Elizabeth, and was baptized February 24, 1603, exactly</p>
<p>a month before the great queen passed away.  The mother of the</p>
<p>immortal Dreamer was one Margaret Bentley, who, like her husband,</p>
<p>was a native of Elstow and only a few months his junior.  The</p>
<p>details of her mother&#x27;s will, which is still extant, drawn up by</p>
<p>the vicar of Elstow, prove that, like her husband, she did not, in</p>
<p>the words of Bunyan&#x27;s latest and most complete biographer, the Rev.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown, &quot;come of the very squalid poor, but of people who,</p>
<p>though humble in station, were yet decent and worthy in their</p>
<p>ways.&quot;  John Bunyan&#x27;s mother was his father&#x27;s second wife.  The</p>
<p>Bunyans were given to marrying early, and speedily consoled</p>
<p>themselves on the loss of one wife with the companionship of a</p>
<p>successor.  Bunyan&#x27;s grandmother cannot have died before February</p>
<p>24, 1603, the date of his father&#x27;s baptism.  But before the year</p>
<p>was out his grandfather had married again.  His father, too, had</p>
<p>not completed his twentieth year when he married his first wife,</p>
<p>Anne Pinney, January 10, 1623.  She died in 1627, apparently</p>
<p>without any surviving children, and before the year was half-way</p>
<p>through, on the 23rd of the following May, he was married a second</p>
<p>time to Margaret Bentley.  At the end of seventeen years Thomas</p>
<p>Bunyan was again left a widower, and within two months, with</p>
<p>grossly indecent haste, he filled the vacant place with a third</p>
<p>wife.  Bunyan himself cannot have been much more than twenty when</p>
<p>he married.  We have no particulars of the death of his first wife.</p>
<p>But he had been married two years to his noble-minded second wife</p>
<p>at the time of the assizes in 1661, and the ages of his children by</p>
<p>his first wife would indicate that no long interval elapsed between</p>
<p>his being left a widower and his second marriage.</p>
<p>Elstow, which, as the birthplace of the author of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>Progress,&quot; has gained a world-wide celebrity, is a quiet little</p>
<p>village, which, though not much more than a mile from the populous</p>
<p>and busy town of Bedford, yet, lying aside from the main stream of</p>
<p>modern life, preserves its old-world look to an unusual degree.</p>
<p>Its name in its original form of &quot;Helen-stow,&quot; or &quot;Ellen-stow,&quot; the</p>
<p>STOW or stockaded place of St. Helena, is derived from a</p>
<p>Benedictine nunnery founded in 1078 by Judith, niece of William the</p>
<p>Conqueror, the traitorous wife of the judicially murdered Waltheof,</p>
<p>Earl of Huntingdon, in honour of the mother of the Emperor</p>
<p>Constantine.  The parish church, so intimately connected with</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s personal history, is a fragment of the church of the</p>
<p>nunnery, with a detached campanile, or &quot;steeple-house,&quot; built to</p>
<p>contain the bells after the destruction of the central tower and</p>
<p>choir of the conventual church.  Few villages are so little</p>
<p>modernized as Elstow.  The old half-timbered cottages with</p>
<p>overhanging storeys, peaked dormers, and gabled porches, tapestried</p>
<p>with roses and honeysuckles, must be much what they were in</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s days.  A village street, with detached cottages standing</p>
<p>in gardens gay with the homely flowers John Bunyan knew and loved,</p>
<p>leads to the village green, fringed with churchyard elms, in the</p>
<p>middle of which is the pedestal or stump of the market-cross, and</p>
<p>at the upper end of the old &quot;Moot Hall,&quot; a quaint brick and timber</p>
<p>building, with a projecting upper storey, a good example of the</p>
<p>domestic architecture of the fifteenth century, originally,</p>
<p>perhaps, the Guesten-Hall of the adjacent nunnery, and afterwards</p>
<p>the Court House of the manor when lay-lords had succeeded the</p>
<p>abbesses - &quot;the scene,&quot; writes Dr. Brown &quot;of village festivities,</p>
<p>statute hirings, and all the public occasions of village life.&quot;</p>
<p>The whole spot and its surroundings can be but little altered from</p>
<p>the time when our hero was the ringleader of the youth of the place</p>
<p>in the dances on the greensward, which he tells us he found it so</p>
<p>hard to give up, and in &quot;tip-cat,&quot; and the other innocent games</p>
<p>which his diseased conscience afterwards regarded as &quot;ungodly</p>
<p>practices.&quot;  One may almost see the hole from which he was going to</p>
<p>strike his &quot;cat&quot; that memorable Sunday afternoon when he silenced</p>
<p>the inward voice which rebuked him for his sins, and &quot;returned</p>
<p>desperately to his sport again.&quot;  On the south side of the green,</p>
<p>as we have said, stands the church, a fine though somewhat rude</p>
<p>fragment of the chapel of the nunnery curtailed at both ends, of</p>
<p>Norman and Early English date, which, with its detached bell tower,</p>
<p>was the scene of some of the fierce spiritual conflicts so vividly</p>
<p>depicted by Bunyan in his &quot;Grace Abounding.&quot;  On entering every</p>
<p>object speaks of Bunyan.  The pulpit - if it has survived the</p>
<p>recent restoration - is the same from which Christopher Hall, the</p>
<p>then &quot;Parson&quot; of Elstow, preached the sermon which first awoke his</p>
<p>sleeping conscience.  The font is that in which he was baptized, as</p>
<p>were also his father and mother and remoter progenitors, as well as</p>
<p>his children, Mary, his dearly-loved blind child, on July 20, 1650,</p>
<p>and her younger sister, Elizabeth, on April 14, 1654.  An old oaken</p>
<p>bench, polished by the hands of thousands of visitors attracted to</p>
<p>the village church by the fame of the tinker of Elstow, is</p>
<p>traditionally shown as the seat he used to occupy when he &quot;went to</p>
<p>church twice a day, and that, too, with the foremost counting all</p>
<p>things holy that were therein contained.&quot;  The five bells which</p>
<p>hang in the belfry are the same in which Bunyan so much delighted,</p>
<p>the fourth bell, tradition says, being that he was used to ring.</p>
<p>The rough flagged floor, &quot;all worn and broken with the hobnailed</p>
<p>boots of generations of ringers,&quot; remains undisturbed.  One cannot</p>
<p>see the door, set in its solid masonry, without recalling the</p>
<p>figure of Bunyan standing in it, after conscience, &quot;beginning to be</p>
<p>tender,&quot; told him that &quot;such practice was but vain,&quot; but yet unable</p>
<p>to deny himself the pleasure of seeing others ring, hoping that,</p>
<p>&quot;if a bell should fall,&quot; he could &quot;slip out&quot; safely &quot;behind the</p>
<p>thick walls,&quot; and so &quot;be preserved notwithstanding.&quot;  Behind the</p>
<p>church, on the south side, stand some picturesque ivy-clad remains</p>
<p>of the once stately mansion of the Hillersdons, erected on the site</p>
<p>of the nunnery buildings in the early part of the seventeenth</p>
<p>century, with a porch attributed to Inigo Jones, which may have</p>
<p>given Bunyan the first idea of &quot;the very stately Palace, the name</p>
<p>of which was Beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>The cottage where Bunyan was born, between the two brooks in the</p>
<p>fields at Harrowden, has been so long destroyed that even the</p>
<p>knowledge of its site has passed away.  That in which he lived for</p>
<p>six years (1649-1655) after his first marriage, and where his</p>
<p>children were born, is still standing in the village street, but</p>
<p>modern reparations have robbed it of all interest.</p>
<p>From this description of the surroundings among which Bunyan passed</p>
<p>the earliest and most impressionable years of his life, we pass to</p>
<p>the subject of our biography himself.  The notion that Bunyan was</p>
<p>of gipsy descent, which was not entirely rejected by Sir Walter</p>
<p>Scott, and which has more recently received elaborate support from</p>
<p>writers on the other side of the Atlantic, may be pronounced</p>
<p>absolutely baseless.  Even if Bunyan&#x27;s inquiry of his father</p>
<p>&quot;whether the family was of Israelitish descent or no,&quot; which has</p>
<p>been so strangely pressed into the service of the theory, could be</p>
<p>supposed to have anything to do with the matter, the decided</p>
<p>negative with which his question was met - &quot;he told me, &#x27;No, we</p>
<p>were not&#x27;&quot; - would, one would have thought, have settled the point.</p>
<p>But some fictions die hard.  However low the family had sunk, so</p>
<p>that in his own words, &quot;his father&#x27;s house was of that rank that is</p>
<p>meanest and most despised of all the families in the land,&quot; &quot;of a</p>
<p>low and inconsiderable generation,&quot; the name, as we have seen, was</p>
<p>one of long standing in Bunyan&#x27;s native county, and had once taken</p>
<p>far higher rank in it.  And his parents, though poor, were</p>
<p>evidently worthy people, of good repute among their village</p>
<p>neighbours.  Bunyan seems to be describing his own father and his</p>
<p>wandering life when he speaks of &quot;an honest poor labouring man,</p>
<p>who, like Adam unparadised, had all the world to get his bread in,</p>
<p>and was very careful to maintain his family.&quot;  He and his wife were</p>
<p>also careful with a higher care that their children should be</p>
<p>properly educated.  &quot;Notwithstanding the meanness and</p>
<p>inconsiderableness of my parents,&quot; writes Bunyan, &quot;it pleased God</p>
<p>to put it into their hearts to put me to school, to learn both to</p>
<p>read and write.&quot;  If we accept the evidence of the &quot;Scriptural</p>
<p>Poems,&quot; published for the first time twelve years after his death,</p>
<p>the genuineness of which, though questioned by Dr. Brown, there</p>
<p>seems no sufficient reason to doubt, the little education he had</p>
<p>was &quot;gained in a grammar school.&quot;  This would have been that</p>
<p>founded by Sir William Harpur in Queen Mary&#x27;s reign in the</p>
<p>neighbouring town of Bedford.  Thither we may picture the little</p>
<p>lad trudging day by day along the mile and a half of footpath and</p>
<p>road from his father&#x27;s cottage by the brookside, often, no doubt,</p>
<p>wet and miry enough, not, as he says, to &quot;go to school to Aristotle</p>
<p>or Plato,&quot; but to be taught &quot;according to the rate of other poor</p>
<p>men&#x27;s children.&quot;  The Bedford school-master about this time,</p>
<p>William Barnes by name, was a negligent sot, charged with &quot;night-</p>
<p>walking&quot; and haunting &quot;taverns and alehouses,&quot; and other evil</p>
<p>practices, as well as with treating the poor boys &quot;when present&quot;</p>
<p>with a cruelty which must have made them wish that his absences,</p>
<p>long as they were, had been more protracted.  Whether this man was</p>
<p>his master or no, it was little that Bunyan learnt at school, and</p>
<p>that little he confesses with shame he soon lost &quot;almost utterly.&quot;</p>
<p>He was before long called home to help his father at the Harrowden</p>
<p>forge, where he says he was &quot;brought up in a very mean condition</p>
<p>among a company of poor countrymen.&quot;  Here, with but little to</p>
<p>elevate or refine his character, the boy contracted many bad</p>
<p>habits, and grew up what Coleridge somewhat too strongly calls &quot;a</p>
<p>bitter blackguard.&quot;  According to his own remorseful confession, he</p>
<p>was &quot;filled with all unrighteousness,&quot; having &quot;from a child&quot; in his</p>
<p>&quot;tender years,&quot; &quot;but few equals both for cursing, swearing, lying</p>
<p>and blaspheming the holy name of God.&quot;  Sins of this kind he</p>
<p>declares became &quot;a second nature to him;&quot; he &quot;delighted in all</p>
<p>transgression against the law of God,&quot; and as he advanced in his</p>
<p>teens he became a &quot;notorious sinbreeder,&quot; the &quot;very ringleader,&quot; he</p>
<p>says, of the village lads &quot;in all manner of vice and ungodliness.&quot;</p>
<p>But the unsparing condemnation passed by Bunyan, after his</p>
<p>conversion, on his former self, must not mislead us into supposing</p>
<p>him ever, either as boy or man, to have lived a vicious life.  &quot;The</p>
<p>wickedness of the tinker,&quot; writes Southey, &quot;has been greatly</p>
<p>overrated, and it is taking the language of self-accusation too</p>
<p>literally to pronounce of John Bunyan that he was at any time</p>
<p>depraved.&quot;  The justice of this verdict of acquittal is fully</p>
<p>accepted by Coleridge.  &quot;Bunyan,&quot; he says, &quot;was never in our</p>
<p>received sense of the word &#x27;wicked.&#x27;  He was chaste, sober, and</p>
<p>honest.&quot;  He hints at youthful escapades, such, perhaps, as</p>
<p>orchard-robbing, or when a little older, poaching, and the like,</p>
<p>which might have brought him under &quot;the stroke of the laws,&quot; and</p>
<p>put him to &quot;open shame before the face of the world.&quot;  But he</p>
<p>confesses to no crime or profligate habit.  We have no reason to</p>
<p>suppose that he was ever drunk, and we have his own most solemn</p>
<p>declaration that he was never guilty of an act of unchastity.  &quot;In</p>
<p>our days,&quot; to quote Mr. Froude, &quot;a rough tinker who could say as</p>
<p>much for himself after he had grown to manhood, would be regarded</p>
<p>as a model of self-restraint.  If in Bedford and the neighbourhood</p>
<p>there was no young man more vicious than Bunyan, the moral standard</p>
<p>of an English town in the seventeenth century must have been higher</p>
<p>than believers in progress will be pleased to allow.&quot;  How then, it</p>
<p>may be asked, are we to explain the passionate language in which he</p>
<p>expresses his self-abhorrence, which would hardly seem exaggerated</p>
<p>in the mouth of the most profligate and licentious?  We are</p>
<p>confident that Bunyan meant what he said.  So intensely honest a</p>
<p>nature could not allow his words to go beyond his convictions.</p>
<p>When he speaks of &quot;letting loose the reins to his lusts,&quot; and</p>
<p>sinning &quot;with the greatest delight and ease,&quot; we know that however</p>
<p>exaggerated they may appear to us, his expressions did not seem to</p>
<p>him overstrained.  Dr. Johnson marvelled that St. Paul could call</p>
<p>himself &quot;the chief of sinners,&quot; and expressed a doubt whether he</p>
<p>did so honestly.  But a highly-strung spiritual nature like that of</p>
<p>the apostle, when suddenly called into exercise after a period of</p>
<p>carelessness, takes a very different estimate of sin from that of</p>
<p>the world, even the decent moral world, in general.  It realizes</p>
<p>its own offences, venial as they appear to others, as sins against</p>
<p>infinite love - a love unto death - and in the light of the</p>
<p>sacrifice on Calvary, recognizes the heinousness of its guilt, and</p>
<p>while it doubts not, marvels that it can be pardoned.  The</p>
<p>sinfulness of sin - more especially their own sin - is the</p>
<p>intensest of all possible realities to them.  No language is too</p>
<p>strong to describe it.  We may not unreasonably ask whether this</p>
<p>estimate, however exaggerated it may appear to those who are</p>
<p>strangers to these spiritual experiences, is altogether a mistaken</p>
<p>one?</p>
<p>The spiritual instinct was very early awakened in Bunyan.  While</p>
<p>still a child &quot;but nine or ten years old,&quot; he tells us he was</p>
<p>racked with convictions of sin, and haunted with religious fears.</p>
<p>He was scared with &quot;fearful dreams,&quot; and &quot;dreadful visions,&quot; and</p>
<p>haunted in his sleep with &quot;apprehensions of devils and wicked</p>
<p>spirits&quot; coming to carry him away, which made his bed a place of</p>
<p>terrors.  The thought of the Day of Judgment and of the torments of</p>
<p>the lost, often came as a dark cloud over his mind in the midst of</p>
<p>his boyish sports, and made him tremble.  But though these fevered</p>
<p>visions embittered his enjoyment while they lasted, they were but</p>
<p>transient, and after a while they entirely ceased &quot;as if they had</p>
<p>never been,&quot; and he gave himself up without restraint to the</p>
<p>youthful pleasures in which his ardent nature made him ever the</p>
<p>ringleader.  The &quot;thoughts of religion&quot; became very grievous to</p>
<p>him.  He could not endure even to see others read pious books; &quot;it</p>
<p>would be as a prison to me.&quot;  The awful realities of eternity which</p>
<p>had once been so crushing to his spirit were &quot;both out of sight and</p>
<p>mind.&quot;  He said to God, &quot;depart from me.&quot;  According to the later</p>
<p>morbid estimate which stigmatized as sinful what were little more</p>
<p>than the wild acts of a roystering dare-devil young fellow, full of</p>
<p>animal spirits and with an unusually active imagination, he &quot;could</p>
<p>sin with the greatest delight and ease, and take pleasure in the</p>
<p>vileness of his companions.&quot;  But that the sense of religion was</p>
<p>not wholly dead in him even then, and that while discarding its</p>
<p>restraints he had an inward reverence for it, is shown by the</p>
<p>horror he experienced if those who had a reputation for godliness</p>
<p>dishonoured their profession.  &quot;Once,&quot; he says, &quot;when I was at the</p>
<p>height of my vanity, hearing one to swear who was reckoned for a</p>
<p>religious man, it had so great a stroke upon my spirit that it made</p>
<p>my heart to ache.&quot;</p>
<p>This undercurrent of religious feeling was deepened by providential</p>
<p>escapes from accidents which threatened his life - &quot;judgments mixed</p>
<p>with mercy&quot; he terms them, - which made him feel that he was not</p>
<p>utterly forsaken of God.  Twice he narrowly escaped drowning; once</p>
<p>in &quot;Bedford river&quot; - the Ouse; once in &quot;a creek of the sea,&quot; his</p>
<p>tinkering rounds having, perhaps, carried him as far northward as</p>
<p>the tidal inlets of the Wash in the neighbourhood of Spalding or</p>
<p>Lynn, or to the estuaries of the Stour and Orwell to the east.  At</p>
<p>another time, in his wild contempt of danger, he tore out, while</p>
<p>his companions looked on with admiration, what he mistakenly</p>
<p>supposed to be an adder&#x27;s sting.</p>
<p>These providential deliverances bring us to that incident in his</p>
<p>brief career as a soldier which his anonymous biographer tells us</p>
<p>&quot;made so deep an impression upon him that he would never mention</p>
<p>it, which he often did, without thanksgiving to God.&quot;  But for this</p>
<p>occurrence, indeed, we should have probably never known that he had</p>
<p>ever served in the army at all.  The story is best told in his own</p>
<p>provokingly brief words - &quot;When I was a soldier I with others were</p>
<p>drawn out to go to such a place to besiege it.  But when I was just</p>
<p>ready to go, one of the company desired to go in my room; to which</p>
<p>when I consented, he took my place, and coming to the siege, as he</p>
<p>stood sentinel, he was shot in the head with a musket bullet and</p>
<p>died.&quot;  Here, as is so often the case in Bunyan&#x27;s autobiography, we</p>
<p>have reason to lament the complete absence of details.  This is</p>
<p>characteristic of the man.  The religious import of the occurrences</p>
<p>he records constituted their only value in his eyes; their temporal</p>
<p>setting, which imparts their chief interest to us, was of no</p>
<p>account to him.  He gives us not the slightest clue to the name of</p>
<p>the besieged place, or even to the side on which he was engaged.</p>
<p>The date of the event is left equally vague.  The last point</p>
<p>however we are able to determine with something like accuracy.</p>
<p>November, 1644, was the earliest period at which Bunyan could have</p>
<p>entered the army, for it was not till then that he reached the</p>
<p>regulation age of sixteen.  Domestic circumstances had then</p>
<p>recently occurred which may have tended to estrange him from his</p>
<p>home, and turn his thoughts to a military life.  In the previous</p>
<p>June his mother had died, her death being followed within a month</p>
<p>by that of his sister Margaret.  Before another month was out, his</p>
<p>father, as we have already said, had married again, and whether the</p>
<p>new wife had proved the proverbial INJUSTA NOVERCA or not, his home</p>
<p>must have been sufficiently altered by the double, if we may not</p>
<p>say triple, calamity, to account for his leaving the dull monotony</p>
<p>of his native village for the more stirring career of a soldier.</p>
<p>Which of the two causes then distracting the nation claimed his</p>
<p>adherence, Royalist or Parliamentarian, can never be determined.</p>
<p>As Mr. Froude writes, &quot;He does not tell us himself.  His friends in</p>
<p>after life did not care to ask him or he to inform them, or else</p>
<p>they thought the matter of too small importance to be worth</p>
<p>mentioning with exactness.&quot;  The only evidence is internal, and the</p>
<p>deductions from it vary with the estimate of the counter-balancing</p>
<p>probabilities taken by Bunyan&#x27;s various biographers.  Lord</p>
<p>Macaulay, whose conclusion is ably, and, we think, convincingly</p>
<p>supported by Dr. Brown, decides in favour of the side of the</p>
<p>Parliament.  Mr. Froude, on the other hand, together with the</p>
<p>painstaking Mr. Offor, holds that &quot;probability is on the side of</p>
<p>his having been with the Royalists.&quot;  Bedfordshire, however, was</p>
<p>one of the &quot;Associated Counties&quot; from which the Parliamentary army</p>
<p>drew its main strength, and it was shut in by a strong line of</p>
<p>defence from any combination with the Royalist army.  In 1643 the</p>
<p>county had received an order requiring it to furnish &quot;able and</p>
<p>armed men&quot; to the garrison at Newport Pagnel, which was then the</p>
<p>base of operations against the King in that part of England.  All</p>
<p>probability therefore points to John Bunyan, the lusty young tinker</p>
<p>of Elstow, the leader in all manly sports and adventurous</p>
<p>enterprises among his mates, and probably caring very little on</p>
<p>what side he fought, having been drafted to Newport to serve under</p>
<p>Sir Samuel Luke, of Cople, and other Parliamentary commanders.  The</p>
<p>place of the siege he refers to is equally undeterminable.  A</p>
<p>tradition current within a few years of Bunyan&#x27;s death, which Lord</p>
<p>Macaulay rather rashly invests with the certainty of fact, names</p>
<p>Leicester.  The only direct evidence for this is the statement of</p>
<p>an anonymous biographer, who professes to have been a personal</p>
<p>friend of Bunyan&#x27;s, that he was present at the siege of Leicester,</p>
<p>in 1645, as a soldier in the Parliamentary army.  This statement,</p>
<p>however, is in direct defiance of Bunyan&#x27;s own words.  For the one</p>
<p>thing certain in the matter is that wherever the siege may have</p>
<p>been, Bunyan was not at it.  He tells us plainly that he was &quot;drawn</p>
<p>to go,&quot; and that when he was just starting, he gave up his place to</p>
<p>a comrade who went in his room, and was shot through the head.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s presence at the siege of Leicester, which has been so</p>
<p>often reported that it has almost been regarded as an historical</p>
<p>truth, must therefore take its place among the baseless creations</p>
<p>of a fertile fancy.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s military career, wherever passed and under whatever</p>
<p>standard, was very short.  The civil war was drawing near the end</p>
<p>of its first stage when he enlisted.  He had only been a soldier a</p>
<p>few months when the battle of Naseby, fatal to the royal cause, was</p>
<p>fought, June 14, 1645.  Bristol was surrendered by Prince Rupert,</p>
<p>Sept. 10th.  Three days later Montrose was totally defeated at</p>
<p>Philiphaugh; and after a vain attempt to relieve Chester, Charles</p>
<p>shut himself up in Oxford.  The royal garrisons yielded in quick</p>
<p>succession; in 1646 the armies on both sides were disbanded, and</p>
<p>the first act in the great national tragedy having come to a close,</p>
<p>Bunyan returned to Elstow, and resumed his tinker&#x27;s work at the</p>
<p>paternal forge.  His father, old Thomas Bunyan, it may here be</p>
<p>mentioned, lived all through his famous son&#x27;s twelve years&#x27;</p>
<p>imprisonment, witnessed his growing celebrity as a preacher and a</p>
<p>writer, and died in the early part of 1676, just when John Bunyan</p>
<p>was passing through his last brief period of durance, which was to</p>
<p>give birth to the work which has made him immortal.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<p>It cannot have been more than two or three years after Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>return home from his short experience of a soldier&#x27;s life, that he</p>
<p>took the step which, more than any other, influences a man&#x27;s future</p>
<p>career for good or for evil.  The young tinker married.  With his</p>
<p>characteristic disregard of all facts or dates but such as concern</p>
<p>his spiritual history, Bunyan tells us nothing about the orphan</p>
<p>girl he made his wife.  Where he found her, who her parents were,</p>
<p>where they were married, even her christian name, were all deemed</p>
<p>so many irrelevant details.  Indeed the fact of his marriage would</p>
<p>probably have been passed over altogether but for the important</p>
<p>bearing it hid on his inner life.  His &quot;mercy,&quot; as he calls it,</p>
<p>&quot;was to light upon a wife whose father was counted godly,&quot; and who,</p>
<p>though she brought him no marriage portion, so that they &quot;came</p>
<p>together as poor as poor might be,&quot; as &quot;poor as howlets,&quot; to adopt</p>
<p>his own simile, &quot;without so much household stuff as a dish or a</p>
<p>spoon betwixt&quot; them, yet brought with her to the Elstow cottage two</p>
<p>religious books, which had belonged to her father, and which he</p>
<p>&quot;had left her when he died.&quot;  These books were &quot;The Plain Man&#x27;s</p>
<p>Pathway to Heaven,&quot; the work of Arthur Dent, the puritan incumbent</p>
<p>of Shoebury, in Essex - &quot;wearisomely heavy and theologically</p>
<p>narrow,&quot; writes Dr. Brown - and &quot;The Practise of Piety,&quot; by Dr.</p>
<p>Lewis Bayley, Bishop of Bangor, and previously chaplain to Prince</p>
<p>Henry, which enjoyed a wide reputation with puritans as well as</p>
<p>with churchmen.  Together with these books, the young wife brought</p>
<p>the still more powerful influence of a religious training, and the</p>
<p>memory of a holy example, often telling her young graceless husband</p>
<p>&quot;what a godly man her father was, and how he would reprove and</p>
<p>correct vice both in his house and amongst his neighbours, and what</p>
<p>a strict and holy life he lived in his days both in word and deed.&quot;</p>
<p>Much as Bunyan tells us he had lost of the &quot;little he had learnt&quot;</p>
<p>at school, he had not lost it &quot;utterly.&quot;  He was still able to read</p>
<p>intelligently.  His wife&#x27;s gentle influence prevailed on him to</p>
<p>begin &quot;sometimes to read&quot; her father&#x27;s legacy &quot;with her.&quot;  This</p>
<p>must have been entirely new reading for Bunyan, and certainly at</p>
<p>first not much to his taste.  What his favourite reading had been</p>
<p>up to this time, his own nervous words tell us, &quot;Give me a ballad,</p>
<p>a news-book, George on Horseback, or Bevis of Southampton; give me</p>
<p>some book that teaches curious arts, that tells of old fables.&quot;</p>
<p>But as he and his young wife read these books together at their</p>
<p>fireside, a higher taste was gradually awakened in Bunyan&#x27;s mind;</p>
<p>&quot;some things&quot; in them he &quot;found somewhat pleasing&quot; to him, and they</p>
<p>&quot;begot&quot; within him &quot;some desires to religion,&quot; producing a degree</p>
<p>of outward reformation.  The spiritual instinct was aroused.  He</p>
<p>would be a godly man like his wife&#x27;s father.  He began to &quot;go to</p>
<p>church twice a day, and that too with the foremost.&quot;  Nor was it a</p>
<p>mere formal attendance, for when there he tells us he took his part</p>
<p>with all outward devotion in the service, &quot;both singing and saying</p>
<p>as others did; yet,&quot; as he penitently confesses, &quot;retaining his</p>
<p>wicked life,&quot; the wickedness of which, however, did not amount to</p>
<p>more than a liking for the sports and games of the lads of the</p>
<p>village, bell-ringing, dancing, and the like.  The prohibition of</p>
<p>all liturgical forms issued in 1645, the observance of which varied</p>
<p>with the strictness or laxity of the local authorities, would not</p>
<p>seem to have been put in force very rigidly at Elstow.  The vicar,</p>
<p>Christopher Hall, was an Episcopalian, who, like Bishop Sanderson,</p>
<p>retained his benefice unchallenged all through the Protectorate,</p>
<p>and held it some years after the Restoration and the passing of the</p>
<p>Act of Uniformity.  He seems, like Sanderson, to have kept himself</p>
<p>within the letter of the law by making trifling variations in the</p>
<p>Prayer Book formularies, consistent with a general conformity to</p>
<p>the old order of the Church, &quot;without persisting to his own</p>
<p>destruction in the usage of the entire liturgy.&quot;  The decent</p>
<p>dignity of the ceremonial of his parish church had a powerful</p>
<p>effect on Bunyan&#x27;s freshly awakened religious susceptibility - a</p>
<p>&quot;spirit of superstition&quot; he called it afterwards - and helped to</p>
<p>its fuller development.  &quot;I adored,&quot; he says, &quot;with great devotion,</p>
<p>even all things, both the High Place&quot; - altars then had not been</p>
<p>entirely broken down and levelled in Bedfordshire - &quot;Priest, Clerk,</p>
<p>Vestment, Service, and what else belonging to the church, counting</p>
<p>all things holy that were therein contained, and especially the</p>
<p>Priest and Clerk most happy, and without doubt greatly blessed</p>
<p>because they were the servants of God and were principal in the</p>
<p>Holy Temple, to do His work therein, . . . their name, their garb,</p>
<p>and work, did so intoxicate and bewitch me.&quot;  If it is questionable</p>
<p>whether the Act forbidding the use of the Book of Common Prayer was</p>
<p>strictly observed at Elstow, it is certain that the prohibition of</p>
<p>Sunday sports was not.  Bunyan&#x27;s narrative shows that the aspect of</p>
<p>a village green in Bedfordshire during the Protectorate did not</p>
<p>differ much from what Baxter tells us it had been in Shropshire</p>
<p>before the civil troubles began, where, &quot;after the Common Prayer</p>
<p>had been read briefly, the rest of the day even till dark night</p>
<p>almost, except eating time, was spent in dancing under a maypole</p>
<p>and a great tree, when all the town did meet together.&quot;  These</p>
<p>Sunday sports proved the battle-ground of Bunyan&#x27;s spiritual</p>
<p>experience, the scene of the fierce inward struggles which he has</p>
<p>described so vividly, through which he ultimately reached the firm</p>
<p>ground of solid peace and hope.  As a high-spirited healthy</p>
<p>athletic young fellow, all kinds of manly sports were Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>delight.  On week days his tinker&#x27;s business, which he evidently</p>
<p>pursued industriously, left him small leisure for such amusements.</p>
<p>Sunday therefore was the day on which he &quot;did especially solace</p>
<p>himself&quot; with them.  He had yet to learn the identification of</p>
<p>diversions with &quot;all manner of vice.&quot;  The teaching came in this</p>
<p>way.  One Sunday, Vicar Hall preached a sermon on the sin of</p>
<p>Sabbath-breaking, and like many hearers before and since, he</p>
<p>imagined that it was aimed expressly at him.  Sermon ended, he went</p>
<p>home &quot;with a great burden upon his spirit,&quot; &quot;sermon-stricken&quot; and</p>
<p>&quot;sermon sick&quot; as he expresses it elsewhere.  But his Sunday&#x27;s</p>
<p>dinner speedily drove away his self-condemning thoughts.  He &quot;shook</p>
<p>the sermon out of his mind,&quot; and went out to his sports with the</p>
<p>Elstow lads on the village green, with as &quot;great delight&quot; as ever.</p>
<p>But in the midst of his game of tip-cat or &quot;sly,&quot; just as he had</p>
<p>struck the &quot;cat&quot; from its hole, and was going to give it a second</p>
<p>blow - the minuteness of the detail shows the unforgetable reality</p>
<p>of the crisis - he seemed to hear a voice from heaven asking him</p>
<p>whether &quot;he would leave his sins and go to heaven, or keep his sins</p>
<p>and go to hell.&quot;  He thought also that he saw Jesus Christ looking</p>
<p>down on him with threatening countenance.  But like his own Hopeful</p>
<p>he &quot;shut his eyes against the light,&quot; and silenced the condemning</p>
<p>voice with the feeling that repentance was hopeless.  &quot;It was too</p>
<p>late for him to look after heaven; he was past pardon.&quot;  If his</p>
<p>condemnation was already sealed and he was eternally lost, it would</p>
<p>not matter whether he was condemned for many sins or for few.</p>
<p>Heaven was gone already.  The only happiness he could look for was</p>
<p>what he could get out of his sins - his morbidly sensitive</p>
<p>conscience perversely identifying sports with sin - so he returned</p>
<p>desperately to his games, resolved, he says, to &quot;take my fill of</p>
<p>sin, still studying what sin was yet to be committed that I might</p>
<p>taste the sweetness of it.&quot;</p>
<p>This desperate recklessness lasted with him &quot;about a month or</p>
<p>more,&quot; till &quot;one day as he was standing at a neighbour&#x27;s shop-</p>
<p>window, cursing and swearing and playing the madman after his</p>
<p>wonted manner, the woman of the house, though a very loose and</p>
<p>ungodly wretch,&quot; rebuked him so severely as &quot;the ungodliest fellow</p>
<p>for swearing that ever she heard, able to spoil all the youth in a</p>
<p>whole town,&quot; that, self-convicted, he hung down his head in silent</p>
<p>shame, wishing himself a little child again that he might unlearn</p>
<p>the wicked habit of which he thought it impossible to break</p>
<p>himself.  Hopeless as the effort seemed to him, it proved</p>
<p>effectual.  He did &quot;leave off his swearing&quot; to his own &quot;great</p>
<p>wonder,&quot; and found that he &quot;could speak better and with more</p>
<p>pleasantness&quot; than when he &quot;put an oath before and another behind,</p>
<p>to give his words authority.&quot;  Thus was one step in his reformation</p>
<p>taken, and never retraced; but, he adds sorrowfully, &quot;all this</p>
<p>while I knew not Jesus Christ, neither did I leave my sports and</p>
<p>plays.&quot;  We might be inclined to ask, why should he leave them?</p>
<p>But indifferent and innocent in themselves, an overstrained</p>
<p>spirituality had taught him to regard them as sinful.  To indulge</p>
<p>in them wounded his morbidly sensitive conscience, and so they were</p>
<p>sin to him.</p>
<p>The next step onward in this religious progress was the study of</p>
<p>the Bible, to which he was led by the conversation of a poor godly</p>
<p>neighbour.  Naturally he first betook himself to the historical</p>
<p>books, which, he tells us, he read &quot;with great pleasure;&quot; but, like</p>
<p>Baxter who, beginning his Bible reading in the same course, writes,</p>
<p>&quot;I neither understood nor relished much the doctrinal part,&quot; he</p>
<p>frankly confesses, &quot;Paul&#x27;s Epistles and such like Scriptures I</p>
<p>could not away with.&quot;  His Bible reading helped forward the outward</p>
<p>reformation he had begun.  He set the keeping the Ten Commandments</p>
<p>before him as his &quot;way to Heaven&quot;; much comforted &quot;sometimes&quot; when,</p>
<p>as he thought, &quot;he kept them pretty well,&quot; but humbled in</p>
<p>conscience when &quot;now and then he broke one.&quot;  &quot;But then,&quot; he says,</p>
<p>&quot;I should repent and say I was sorry for it, and promise God to do</p>
<p>better next time, and then get help again; for then I thought I</p>
<p>pleased God as well as any man in England.&quot;  His progress was slow,</p>
<p>for each step involved a battle, but it was steadily onwards.  He</p>
<p>had a very hard struggle in relinquishing his favourite amusements.</p>
<p>But though he had much yet to learn, his feet were set on the</p>
<p>upward way, and he had no mind to go back, great as the temptation</p>
<p>often was.  He had once delighted in bell-ringing, but &quot;his</p>
<p>conscience beginning to be tender&quot; - morbid we should rather say -</p>
<p>&quot;he thought such practise to be vain, and therefore forced himself</p>
<p>to leave it.&quot;  But &quot;hankering after it still,&quot; he continued to go</p>
<p>while his old companions rang, and look on at what he &quot;durst not&quot;</p>
<p>join in, until the fear that if he thus winked at what his</p>
<p>conscience condemned, a bell, or even the tower itself, might fall</p>
<p>and kill him, put a stop even to that compromise.  Dancing, which</p>
<p>from his boyhood he had practised on the village green, or in the</p>
<p>old Moot Hall, was still harder to give up.  &quot;It was a full year</p>
<p>before I could quite leave that.&quot;  But this too was at last</p>
<p>renounced, and finally.  The power of Bunyan&#x27;s indomitable will was</p>
<p>bracing itself for severe trials yet to come.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bunyan&#x27;s neighbours regarded with amazement the changed</p>
<p>life of the profane young tinker.  &quot;And truly,&quot; he honestly</p>
<p>confesses, &quot;so they well might for this my conversion was as great</p>
<p>as for Tom of Bedlam to become a sober man.&quot;  Bunyan&#x27;s reformation</p>
<p>was soon the town&#x27;s talk; he had &quot;become godly,&quot; &quot;become a right</p>
<p>honest man.&quot;  These commendations flattered is vanity, and he laid</p>
<p>himself out for them.  He was then but a &quot;poor painted hypocrite,&quot;</p>
<p>he says, &quot;proud of his godliness, and doing all he did either to be</p>
<p>seen of, or well spoken of by man.&quot;  This state of self-</p>
<p>satisfaction, he tells us, lasted &quot;for about a twelvemonth or</p>
<p>more.&quot;  During this deceitful calm he says, &quot;I had great peace of</p>
<p>conscience, and should think with myself, &#x27;God cannot choose but</p>
<p>now be pleased with me,&#x27; yea, to relate it in mine own way, I</p>
<p>thought no man in England could please God better than I.&quot;  But no</p>
<p>outward reformation can bring lasting inward peace.  When a man is</p>
<p>honest with himself, the more earnestly he struggles after complete</p>
<p>obedience, the more faulty does his obedience appear.  The good</p>
<p>opinion of others will not silence his own inward condemnation.  He</p>
<p>needs a higher righteousness than his own; a firmer standing-ground</p>
<p>than the shifting quicksand of his own good deeds.  &quot;All this</p>
<p>while,&quot; he writes, &quot;poor wretch as I was, I was ignorant of Jesus</p>
<p>Christ, and going about to establish my own righteousness, and had</p>
<p>perished therein had not God in mercy showed me more of my state by</p>
<p>nature.&quot;</p>
<p>This revolution was nearer than he imagined.  Bunyan&#x27;s self-</p>
<p>satisfaction was rudely shaken, and his need of something deeper in</p>
<p>the way of religion than he had yet experienced was shown him by</p>
<p>the conversation of three or four poor women whom, one day, when</p>
<p>pursuing his tinker&#x27;s calling at Bedford, he came upon &quot;sitting at</p>
<p>a door in the sun, and talking of the things of God.&quot;  These women</p>
<p>were members of the congregation of &quot;the holy Mr. John Gifford,&quot;</p>
<p>who, at that time of ecclesiastical confusion, subsequently became</p>
<p>rector of St. John&#x27;s Church, in Bedford, and master of the hospital</p>
<p>attached to it.  Gifford&#x27;s career had been a strange one.  We hear</p>
<p>of him first as a young major in the king&#x27;s army at the outset of</p>
<p>the Civil War, notorious for his loose and debauched life, taken by</p>
<p>Fairfax at Maidstone in 1648, and condemned to the gallows.  By his</p>
<p>sister&#x27;s help he eluded his keepers&#x27; vigilance, escaped from</p>
<p>prison, and ultimately found his way to Bedford, where for a time</p>
<p>he practised as a physician, though without any change of his loose</p>
<p>habits.  The loss of a large sum of money at gaming awoke a disgust</p>
<p>at his dissolute life.  A few sentences of a pious book deepened</p>
<p>the impression.  He became a converted man, and joined himself to a</p>
<p>handful of earnest Christians in Bedford, who becoming, in the</p>
<p>language of the day, &quot;a church,&quot; he was appointed its first</p>
<p>minister.  Gifford exercised a deep and vital though narrow</p>
<p>influence, leaving behind him at his death, in 1655, the character</p>
<p>of a &quot;wise, tolerant, and truly Christian man.&quot;  The conversation</p>
<p>of the poor women who were destined to exercise so momentous an</p>
<p>influence on Bunyan&#x27;s spiritual life, evidenced how thoroughly they</p>
<p>had drunk in their pastor&#x27;s teaching.  Bunyan himself was at this</p>
<p>time a &quot;brisk talker in the matters of religion,&quot; such as he drew</p>
<p>from the life in his own Talkative.  But the words of these poor</p>
<p>women were entirely beyond him.  They opened a new and blessed land</p>
<p>to which he was a complete stranger.  &quot;They spoke of their own</p>
<p>wretchedness of heart, of their unbelief, of their miserable state</p>
<p>by nature, of the new birth, and the work of God in their souls,</p>
<p>and how the Lord refreshed them, and supported them against the</p>
<p>temptations of the Devil by His words and promises.&quot;  But what</p>
<p>seems to have struck Bunyan the most forcibly was the happiness</p>
<p>which their religion shed in the hearts of these poor women.</p>
<p>Religion up to this time had been to him a system of rules and</p>
<p>restrictions.  Heaven was to be won by doing certain things and not</p>
<p>doing certain other things.  Of religion as a Divine life kindled</p>
<p>in the soul, and flooding it with a joy which creates a heaven on</p>
<p>earth, he had no conception.  Joy in believing was a new thing to</p>
<p>him.  &quot;They spake as if joy did make them speak; they spake with</p>
<p>such pleasantness of Scripture language, and with such appearance</p>
<p>of grace in all they said, that they were to me as if they had</p>
<p>found a new world,&quot; a veritable &quot;El Dorado,&quot; stored with the true</p>
<p>riches.  Bunyan, as he says, after he had listened awhile and</p>
<p>wondered at their words, left them and went about his work again.</p>
<p>But their words went with him.  He could not get rid of them.  He</p>
<p>saw that though he thought himself a godly man, and his neighbours</p>
<p>thought so too, he wanted the true tokens of godliness.  He was</p>
<p>convinced that godliness was the only true happiness, and he could</p>
<p>not rest till he had attained it.  So he made it his business to be</p>
<p>going again and again into the company of these good women.  He</p>
<p>could not stay away, and the more he talked with them the more</p>
<p>uneasy he became - &quot;the more I questioned my own condition.&quot;  The</p>
<p>salvation of his soul became all in all to him.  His mind &quot;lay</p>
<p>fixed on eternity like a horse-leech at the vein.&quot;  The Bible</p>
<p>became precious to him.  He read it with new eyes, &quot;as I never did</p>
<p>before.&quot;  &quot;I was indeed then never out of the Bible, either by</p>
<p>reading or meditation.&quot;  The Epistles of St. Paul, which before he</p>
<p>&quot;could not away with,&quot; were now &quot;sweet and pleasant&quot; to him.  He</p>
<p>was still &quot;crying out to God that he might know the truth and the</p>
<p>way to Heaven and glory.&quot;  Having no one to guide him in his study</p>
<p>of the most difficult of all books, it is no wonder that he</p>
<p>misinterpreted and misapplied its words in a manner which went far</p>
<p>to unsettle his brain.  He read that without faith he could not be</p>
<p>saved, and though he did not clearly know what faith was, it became</p>
<p>a question of supreme anxiety to him to determine whether he had it</p>
<p>or not.  If not, he was a castaway indeed, doomed to perish for</p>
<p>ever.  So he determined to put it to the test.  The Bible told him</p>
<p>that faith, &quot;even as a grain of mustard seed,&quot; would enable its</p>
<p>possessor to work miracles.  So, as Mr. Froude says, &quot;not</p>
<p>understanding Oriental metaphors,&quot; he thought he had here a simple</p>
<p>test which would at once solve the question.  One day as he was</p>
<p>walking along the miry road between Elstow and Bedford, which he</p>
<p>had so often paced as a schoolboy, &quot;the temptation came hot upon</p>
<p>him&quot; to put the matter to the proof, by saying to the puddles that</p>
<p>were in the horse-pads &quot;be dry,&quot; and to the dry places, &quot;be ye</p>
<p>puddles.&quot;  He was just about to utter the words when a sudden</p>
<p>thought stopped him.  Would it not be better just to go under the</p>
<p>hedge and pray that God would enable him?  This pause saved him</p>
<p>from a rash venture, which might have landed him in despair.  For</p>
<p>he concluded that if he tried after praying and nothing came of it,</p>
<p>it would prove that he had no faith, but was a castaway.  &quot;Nay,</p>
<p>thought I, if it be so, I will never try yet, but will stay a</p>
<p>little longer.&quot;  &quot;Then,&quot; he continues, &quot;I was so tossed betwixt the</p>
<p>Devil and my own ignorance, and so perplexed, especially at</p>
<p>sometimes, that I could not tell what to do.&quot;  At another time his</p>
<p>mind, as the minds of thousands have been and will be to the end,</p>
<p>was greatly harassed by the insoluble problems of predestination</p>
<p>and election.  The question was not now whether he had faith, but</p>
<p>&quot;whether he was one of the elect or not, and if not, what then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He might as well leave off and strive no further.&quot;  And then the</p>
<p>strange fancy occurred to him, that the good people at Bedford</p>
<p>whose acquaintance he had recently made, were all that God meant to</p>
<p>save in that part of the country, and that the day of grace was</p>
<p>past and gone for him; that he had overstood the time of mercy.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh that he had turned sooner!&quot; was then his cry.  &quot;Oh that he had</p>
<p>turned seven years before!  What a fool he had been to trifle away</p>
<p>his time till his soul and heaven were lost!&quot;  The text, &quot;compel</p>
<p>them to come in, and yet there is room,&quot; came to his rescue when he</p>
<p>was so harassed and faint that he was &quot;scarce able to take one step</p>
<p>more.&quot;  He found them &quot;sweet words,&quot; for they showed him that there</p>
<p>was &quot;place enough in heaven for him,&quot; and he verily believed that</p>
<p>when Christ spoke them He was thinking of him, and had them</p>
<p>recorded to help him to overcome the vile fear that there was no</p>
<p>place left for him in His bosom.  But soon another fear succeeded</p>
<p>the former.  Was he truly called of Christ?  &quot;He called to them</p>
<p>when He would, and they came to Him.&quot;  But they could not come</p>
<p>unless He called them.  Had He called him?  Would He call him?  If</p>
<p>He did how gladly would he run after Him.  But oh, he feared that</p>
<p>He had no liking to him; that He would not call him.  True</p>
<p>conversion was what he longed for.  &quot;Could it have been gotten for</p>
<p>gold,&quot; he said, &quot;what could I have given for it!  Had I a whole</p>
<p>world, it had all gone ten thousand times over for this, that my</p>
<p>soul might have been in a converted state.&quot;  All those whom he</p>
<p>thought to be truly converted were now lovely in his eyes.  &quot;They</p>
<p>shone, they walked like people that carried the broad seal of</p>
<p>heaven about them.  Oh that he were like them, and shared in their</p>
<p>goodly heritage!&quot;</p>
<p>About this time Bunyan was greatly troubled, though at the same</p>
<p>time encouraged in his endeavours after the blessedness he longed</p>
<p>for so earnestly but could not yet attain to, by &quot;a dream or</p>
<p>vision&quot; which presented itself to him, whether in his waking or</p>
<p>sleeping hours he does not tell us.  He fancied he saw his four</p>
<p>Bedford friends refreshing themselves on the sunny side of a high</p>
<p>mountain while he was shivering with dark and cold on the other</p>
<p>side, parted from them by a high wall with only one small gap in</p>
<p>it, and that not found but after long searching, and so strait and</p>
<p>narrow withal that it needed long and desperate efforts to force</p>
<p>his way through.  At last he succeeded.  &quot;Then,&quot; he says, &quot;I was</p>
<p>exceeding glad, and went and sat down in the midst of them, and so</p>
<p>was comforted with the light and heat of their sun.&quot;</p>
<p>But this sunshine shone but in illusion, and soon gave place to the</p>
<p>old sad questioning, which filled his soul with darkness.  Was he</p>
<p>already called, or should he be called some day?  He would give</p>
<p>worlds to know.  Who could assure him?  At last some words of the</p>
<p>prophet Joel (chap. iii, 21) encouraged him to hope that if not</p>
<p>converted already, the time might come when he should be converted</p>
<p>to Christ.  Despair began to give way to hopefulness.</p>
<p>At this crisis Bunyan took the step which he would have been wise</p>
<p>if he had taken long before.  He sought the sympathy and counsel of</p>
<p>others.  He began to speak his mind to the poor people in Bedford</p>
<p>whose words of religious experiences had first revealed to him his</p>
<p>true condition.  By them he was introduced to their pastor, &quot;the</p>
<p>godly Mr. Gifford,&quot; who invited him to his house and gave him</p>
<p>spiritual counsel.  He began to attend the meetings of his</p>
<p>disciples.</p>
<p>The teaching he received here was but ill-suited for one of</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s morbid sensitiveness.  For it was based upon a constant</p>
<p>introspection and a scrupulous weighing of each word and action,</p>
<p>with a torturing suspicion of its motive, which made a man&#x27;s ever-</p>
<p>varying spiritual feelings the standard of his state before God,</p>
<p>instead of leading him off from self to the Saviour.  It is not,</p>
<p>therefore, at all surprising that a considerable period intervened</p>
<p>before, in the language of his school, &quot;he found peace.&quot;  This</p>
<p>period, which seems to have embraced two or three years, was marked</p>
<p>by that tremendous inward struggle which he has described, &quot;as with</p>
<p>a pen of fire,&quot; in that marvellous piece of religious</p>
<p>autobiography, without a counterpart except in &quot;The Confessions of</p>
<p>St. Augustine,&quot; his &quot;Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s first experiences after his introduction to Mr. Gifford</p>
<p>and the inner circle of his disciples were most discouraging.  What</p>
<p>he heard of God&#x27;s dealings with their souls showed him something of</p>
<p>&quot;the vanity and inward wretchedness of his wicked heart,&quot; and at</p>
<p>the same time roused all its hostility to God&#x27;s will.  &quot;It did work</p>
<p>at that rate for wickedness as it never did before.&quot;  &quot;The</p>
<p>Canaanites WOULD dwell in the land.&quot;  &quot;His heart hankered after</p>
<p>every foolish vanity, and hung back both to and in every duty, as a</p>
<p>clog on the leg of a bird to hinder her from flying.&quot;  He thought</p>
<p>that he was growing &quot;worse and worse,&quot; and was &quot;further from</p>
<p>conversion than ever before.&quot;  Though he longed to let Christ into</p>
<p>his heart, &quot;his unbelief would, as it were, set its shoulder to the</p>
<p>door to keep Him out.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet all the while he was tormented with the most perverse</p>
<p>scrupulosity of conscience.  &quot;As to the act of sinning, I never was</p>
<p>more tender than now; I durst not take a pin or a stick, though but</p>
<p>so big as a straw, for my conscience now was sore, and would smart</p>
<p>at every twist.  I could not now tell how to speak my words, for</p>
<p>fear I should misplace them.  Oh! how gingerly did I then go in all</p>
<p>I did or said:  I found myself in a miry bog, that shook if I did</p>
<p>but stir, and was as those left both of God, and Christ, and the</p>
<p>Spirit, and all good things.&quot;  All the misdoings of his earlier</p>
<p>years rose up against him.  There they were, and he could not rid</p>
<p>himself of them.  He thought that no one could be so bad as he was;</p>
<p>&quot;not even the Devil could be his equal:  he was more loathsome in</p>
<p>his own eyes than a toad.&quot;  What then must God think of him?</p>
<p>Despair seized fast hold of him.  He thought he was &quot;forsaken of</p>
<p>God and given up to the Devil, and to a reprobate mind.&quot;  Nor was</p>
<p>this a transient fit of despondency.  &quot;Thus,&quot; he writes, &quot;I</p>
<p>continued a long while, even for some years together.&quot;</p>
<p>This is not the place minutely to pursue Bunyan&#x27;s religious history</p>
<p>through the sudden alternations of hopes and fears, the fierce</p>
<p>temptations, the torturing illusions, the strange perversions of</p>
<p>isolated scraps of Bible language - texts torn from their context -</p>
<p>the harassing doubts as to the truth of Christianity, the depths of</p>
<p>despair and the elevations of joy, which he has portrayed with his</p>
<p>own inimitable graphic power.  It is a picture of fearful</p>
<p>fascination that he draws.  &quot;A great storm&quot; at one time comes down</p>
<p>upon him, &quot;piece by piece,&quot; which &quot;handled him twenty times worse</p>
<p>than all he had met with before,&quot; while &quot;floods of blasphemies were</p>
<p>poured upon his spirit,&quot; and would &quot;bolt out of his heart.&quot;  He</p>
<p>felt himself driven to commit the unpardonable sin and blaspheme</p>
<p>the Holy Ghost, &quot;whether he would or no.&quot;  &quot;No sin would serve but</p>
<p>that.&quot;  He was ready to &quot;clap his hand under his chin,&quot; to keep his</p>
<p>mouth shut, or to leap head-foremost &quot;into some muckhill-hole,&quot; to</p>
<p>prevent his uttering the fatal words.  At last he persuaded himself</p>
<p>that he had committed the sin, and a good but not overwise man, &quot;an</p>
<p>ancient Christian,&quot; whom he consulted on his sad case, told him he</p>
<p>thought so too, &quot;which was but cold comfort.&quot;  He thought himself</p>
<p>possessed by the devil, and compared himself to a child &quot;carried</p>
<p>off under her apron by a gipsy.&quot;  &quot;Kick sometimes I did, and also</p>
<p>shriek and cry, but yet I was as bound in the wings of the</p>
<p>temptation, and the wind would carry me away.&quot;  He wished himself</p>
<p>&quot;a dog or a toad,&quot; for they &quot;had no soul to be lost as his was like</p>
<p>to be;&quot; and again a hopeless callousness seemed to settle upon him.</p>
<p>&quot;If I would have given a thousand pounds for a tear I could not</p>
<p>shed one; no, nor sometimes scarce desire to shed one.&quot;  And yet he</p>
<p>was all the while bewailing this hardness of heart, in which he</p>
<p>thought himself singular.  &quot;This much sunk me.  I thought my</p>
<p>condition was alone; but how to get out of, or get rid of, these</p>
<p>things I could not.&quot;  Again the very ground of his faith was</p>
<p>shaken.  &quot;Was the Bible true, or was it not rather a fable and</p>
<p>cunning story?&quot;  All thought &quot;their own religion true.  Might not</p>
<p>the Turks have as good Scriptures to prove their Mahomet Saviour as</p>
<p>Christians had for Christ?  What if all we believed in should be</p>
<p>but &#x27;a think-so&#x27; too?&quot;  So powerful and so real were his illusions</p>
<p>that he had hard work to keep himself from praying to things about</p>
<p>him, to &quot;a bush, a bull, a besom, or the like,&quot; or even to Satan</p>
<p>himself.  He heard voices behind him crying out that Satan desired</p>
<p>to have him, and that &quot;so loud and plain that he would turn his</p>
<p>head to see who was calling him;&quot; when on his knees in prayer he</p>
<p>fancied he felt the foul fiend pull his clothes from behind,</p>
<p>bidding him &quot;break off, make haste; you have prayed enough.&quot;</p>
<p>This &quot;horror of great darkness&quot; was not always upon him.  Bunyan</p>
<p>had his intervals of &quot;sunshine-weather&quot; when Giant Despair&#x27;s fits</p>
<p>came on him, and the giant &quot;lost the use of his hand.&quot;  Texts of</p>
<p>Scripture would give him a &quot;sweet glance,&quot; and flood his soul with</p>
<p>comfort.  But these intervals of happiness were but short-lived.</p>
<p>They were but &quot;hints, touches, and short visits,&quot; sweet when</p>
<p>present, but &quot;like Peter&#x27;s sheet, suddenly caught up again into</p>
<p>heaven.&quot;  But, though transient, they helped the burdened Pilgrim</p>
<p>onward.  So vivid was the impression sometimes made, that years</p>
<p>after he could specify the place where these beams of sunlight fell</p>
<p>on him - &quot;sitting in a neighbour&#x27;s house,&quot; - &quot;travelling into the</p>
<p>country,&quot; - as he was &quot;going home from sermon.&quot;  And the joy was</p>
<p>real while it lasted.  The words of the preacher&#x27;s text, &quot;Behold,</p>
<p>thou art fair, my love,&quot; kindling his spirit, he felt his &quot;heart</p>
<p>filled with comfort and hope.&quot;  &quot;Now I could believe that my sins</p>
<p>would be forgiven.&quot;  He was almost beside himself with ecstasy.  &quot;I</p>
<p>was now so taken with the love and mercy of God that I thought I</p>
<p>could have spoken of it even to the very crows that sat upon the</p>
<p>ploughed lands before me, had they been capable to have understood</p>
<p>me.&quot;  &quot;Surely,&quot; he cried with gladness, &quot;I will not forget this</p>
<p>forty years hence.&quot;  &quot;But, alas! within less than forty days I</p>
<p>began to question all again.&quot;  It was the Valley of the Shadow of</p>
<p>Death which Bunyan, like his own Pilgrim, was travelling through.</p>
<p>But, as in his allegory, &quot;by and by the day broke,&quot; and &quot;the Lord</p>
<p>did more fully and graciously discover Himself unto him.&quot;  &quot;One</p>
<p>day,&quot; he writes, &quot;as I was musing on the wickedness and blasphemy</p>
<p>of my heart, that scripture came into my mind, &#x27;He hath made peace</p>
<p>by the Blood of His Cross.&#x27;  By which I was made to see, both again</p>
<p>and again and again that day, that God and my soul were friends by</p>
<p>this blood:  Yea, I saw the justice of God and my sinful soul could</p>
<p>embrace and kiss each other.  This was a good day to me.  I hope I</p>
<p>shall not forget it.&quot;  At another time the &quot;glory and joy&quot; of a</p>
<p>passage in the Hebrews (ii. 14-15) were &quot;so weighty&quot; that &quot;I was</p>
<p>once or twice ready to swoon as I sat, not with grief and trouble,</p>
<p>but with solid joy and peace.&quot;  &quot;But, oh! now how was my soul led</p>
<p>on from truth to truth by God; now had I evidence of my salvation</p>
<p>from heaven, with many golden seals thereon all banging in my</p>
<p>sight, and I would long that the last day were come, or that I were</p>
<p>fourscore years old, that I might die quickly that my soul might be</p>
<p>at rest.&quot;</p>
<p>At this time he fell in with an old tattered copy of Luther&#x27;s</p>
<p>&quot;Commentary on the Galatians,&quot; &quot;so old that it was ready to fall</p>
<p>piece from piece if I did but turn it over.&quot;  As he read, to his</p>
<p>amazement and thankfulness, he found his own spiritual experience</p>
<p>described.  &quot;It was as if his book had been written out of my</p>
<p>heart.&quot;  It greatly comforted him to find that his condition was</p>
<p>not, as he had thought, solitary, but that others had known the</p>
<p>same inward struggles.  &quot;Of all the books that ever he had seen,&quot;</p>
<p>he deemed it &quot;most fit for a wounded conscience.&quot;  This book was</p>
<p>also the means of awakening an intense love for the Saviour.  &quot;Now</p>
<p>I found, as I thought, that I loved Christ dearly.  Oh, methought</p>
<p>my soul cleaved unto Him, my affections cleaved unto Him; I felt</p>
<p>love to Him as hot as fire.&quot;</p>
<p>And very quickly, as he tells us, his &quot;love was tried to some</p>
<p>purpose.&quot;  He became the victim of an extraordinary temptation - &quot;a</p>
<p>freak of fancy,&quot; Mr. Froude terms it - &quot;fancy resenting the</p>
<p>minuteness with which he watched his own emotions.&quot;  He had &quot;found</p>
<p>Christ&quot; and felt Him &quot;most precious to his soul.&quot;  He was now</p>
<p>tempted to give Him up, &quot;to sell and part with this most blessed</p>
<p>Christ, to exchange Him for the things of this life; for anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Nor was this a mere passing, intermittent delusion.  &quot;It lay upon</p>
<p>me for the space of a year, and did follow me so continually that I</p>
<p>was not rid of it one day in a month, no, not sometimes one hour in</p>
<p>many days together, except when I was asleep.&quot;  Wherever he was,</p>
<p>whatever he was doing day and night, in bed, at table, at work, a</p>
<p>voice kept sounding in his ears, bidding him &quot;sell Christ&quot; for this</p>
<p>or that.  He could neither &quot;eat his food, stoop for a pin, chop a</p>
<p>stick, or cast his eyes on anything&quot; but the hateful words were</p>
<p>heard, &quot;not once only, but a hundred times over, as fast as a man</p>
<p>could speak, &#x27;sell Him, sell Him, sell Him,&#x27; and, like his own</p>
<p>Christian in the dark valley, he could not determine whether they</p>
<p>were suggestions of the Wicked One, or came from his own heart.</p>
<p>The agony was so intense, while, for hours together, he struggled</p>
<p>with the temptation, that his whole body was convulsed by it.  It</p>
<p>was no metaphorical, but an actual, wrestling with a tangible</p>
<p>enemy.  He &quot;pushed and thrust with his hands and elbows,&quot; and kept</p>
<p>still answering, as fast as the destroyer said &quot;sell Him,&quot; &quot;No, I</p>
<p>will not, I will not, I will not! not for thousands, thousands,</p>
<p>thousands of worlds!&quot; at least twenty times together.  But the</p>
<p>fatal moment at last came, and the weakened will yielded, against</p>
<p>itself.  One morning as he lay in his bed, the voice came again</p>
<p>with redoubled force, and would not be silenced.  He fought against</p>
<p>it as long as he could, &quot;even until I was almost out of breath,&quot;</p>
<p>when &quot;without any conscious action of his will&quot; the suicidal words</p>
<p>shaped themselves in his heart, &quot;Let Him go if He will.&quot;</p>
<p>Now all was over.  He had spoken the words and they could not be</p>
<p>recalled.  Satan had &quot;won the battle,&quot; and &quot;as a bird that is shot</p>
<p>from the top of a tree, down fell he into great guilt and fearful</p>
<p>despair.&quot;  He left his bed, dressed, and went &quot;moping into the</p>
<p>field,&quot; where for the next two hours he was &quot;like a man bereft of</p>
<p>life, and as one past all recovery and bound to eternal</p>
<p>punishment.&quot;  The most terrible examples in the Bible came trooping</p>
<p>before him.  He had sold his birthright like Esau.  He a betrayed</p>
<p>his Master like Judas - &quot;I was ashamed that I should be like such</p>
<p>an ugly man as Judas.&quot;  There was no longer any place for</p>
<p>repentance.  He was past all recovery; shut up unto the judgment to</p>
<p>come.  He dared hardly pray.  When he tried to do so, he was &quot;as</p>
<p>with a tempest driven away from God,&quot; while something within said,</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tis too late; I am lost; God hath let me fall.&quot;  The texts which</p>
<p>once had comforted him gave him no comfort now; or, if they did, it</p>
<p>was but for a brief space.  &quot;About ten or eleven o&#x27;clock one day,</p>
<p>as I was walking under a hedge and bemoaning myself for this hard</p>
<p>hap that such a thought should arise within me, suddenly this</p>
<p>sentence bolted upon me, &#x27;The blood of Christ cleanseth from all</p>
<p>sin,&#x27;&quot; and gave me &quot;good encouragement.&quot;  But in two or three hours</p>
<p>all was gone.  The terrible words concerning Esau&#x27;s selling his</p>
<p>birthright took possession of his mind, and &quot;held him down.&quot;  This</p>
<p>&quot;stuck with him.&quot;  Though he &quot;sought it carefully with tears,&quot;</p>
<p>there was no restoration for him.  His agony received a terrible</p>
<p>aggravation from a highly coloured narrative of the terrible death</p>
<p>of Francis Spira, an Italian lawyer of the middle of the sixteenth</p>
<p>century, who, having embraced the Protestant religion, was induced</p>
<p>by worldly motives to return to the Roman Catholic Church, and died</p>
<p>full of remorse and despair, from which Bunyan afterwards drew the</p>
<p>awful picture of &quot;the man in the Iron Cage&quot; at &quot;the Interpreter&#x27;s</p>
<p>house.&quot;  The reading of this book was to his &quot;troubled spirit&quot; as</p>
<p>&quot;salt when rubbed into a fresh wound,&quot; &quot;as knives and daggers in</p>
<p>his soul.&quot;  We cannot wonder that his health began to give way</p>
<p>under so protracted a struggle.  His naturally sturdy frame was</p>
<p>&quot;shaken by a continual trembling.&quot;  He would &quot;wind and twine and</p>
<p>shrink under his burden,&quot; the weight of which so crushed him that</p>
<p>he &quot;could neither stand, nor go, nor lie, either at rest or quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>His digestion became disordered, and a pain, &quot;as if his breastbone</p>
<p>would have split asunder,&quot; made him fear that as he had been guilty</p>
<p>of Judas&#x27; sin, so he was to perish by Judas&#x27; end, and &quot;burst</p>
<p>asunder in the midst.&quot;  In the trembling of his limbs he saw Cain&#x27;s</p>
<p>mark set upon him; God had marked him out for his curse.  No one</p>
<p>was ever so bad as he.  No one had ever sinned so flagrantly.  When</p>
<p>he compared his sins with those of David and Solomon and Manasseh</p>
<p>and others which had been pardoned, he found his sin so much</p>
<p>exceeded theirs that he could have no hope of pardon.  Theirs, &quot;it</p>
<p>was true, were great sins; sins of a bloody colour.  But none of</p>
<p>them were of the nature of his.  He had sold his Saviour.  His sin</p>
<p>was point blank against Christ.&quot;  &quot;Oh, methought this sin was</p>
<p>bigger than the sins of a country, of a kingdom, or of the whole</p>
<p>world; not all of them together was able to equal mine; mine</p>
<p>outwent them every one.&quot;</p>
<p>It would be wearisome to follow Bunyan through all the mazes of his</p>
<p>self-torturing illusions.  Fierce as the storm was, and long in its</p>
<p>duration - for it was more than two years before the storm became a</p>
<p>calm - the waves, though he knew it not, in their fierce tossings</p>
<p>which threatened to drive his soul like a broken vessel headlong on</p>
<p>the rocks of despair, were bearing him nearer and nearer to the</p>
<p>&quot;haven where he would be.&quot;  His vivid imagination, as we have seen,</p>
<p>surrounded him with audible voices.  He had heard, as he thought,</p>
<p>the tempter bidding him &quot;Sell Christ;&quot; now he thought he heard God</p>
<p>&quot;with a great voice, as it were, over his shoulder behind him,&quot;</p>
<p>saying, &quot;Return unto Me, for I have redeemed thee;&quot; and though he</p>
<p>felt that the voice mocked him, for he could not return, there was</p>
<p>&quot;no place of repentance&quot; for him, and fled from it, it still</p>
<p>pursued him, &quot;holloaing after him, &#x27;Return, return!&#x27;&quot;  And return</p>
<p>he did, but not all at once, or without many a fresh struggle.</p>
<p>With his usual graphic power he describes the zigzag path by which</p>
<p>he made his way.  His hot and cold fits alternated with fearful</p>
<p>suddenness.  &quot;As Esau beat him down, Christ raised him up.&quot;  &quot;His</p>
<p>life hung in doubt, not knowing which way he should tip.&quot;  More</p>
<p>sensible evidence came.  &quot;One day,&quot; he tells us, &quot;as I walked to</p>
<p>and fro in a good man&#x27;s shop&quot; - we can hardly be wrong in placing</p>
<p>it in Bedford - &quot;bemoaning myself for this hard hap of mine, for</p>
<p>that I should commit so great a sin, greatly fearing that I should</p>
<p>not be pardoned, and ready to sink with fear, suddenly there was as</p>
<p>if there had rushed in at the window the noise of wind upon me, but</p>
<p>very pleasant, and I heard a voice speaking, &#x27;Did&#x27;st ever refuse to</p>
<p>be justified by the Blood of Christ?&#x27;&quot;  Whether the voice were</p>
<p>supernatural or not, he was not, &quot;in twenty years&#x27; time,&quot; able to</p>
<p>determine.  At the time he thought it was.  It was &quot;as if an angel</p>
<p>had come upon me.&quot;  &quot;It commanded a great calm upon me.  It</p>
<p>persuaded me there might be hope.&quot;  But this persuasion soon</p>
<p>vanished.  &quot;In three or four days I began to despair again.&quot;  He</p>
<p>found it harder than ever to pray.  The devil urged that God was</p>
<p>weary of him; had been weary for years past; that he wanted to get</p>
<p>rid of him and his &quot;bawlings in his ears,&quot; and therefore He had let</p>
<p>him commit this particular sin that he might be cut off altogether.</p>
<p>For such an one to pray was but to add sin to sin.  There was no</p>
<p>hope for him.  Christ might indeed pity him and wish to help him;</p>
<p>but He could not, for this sin was unpardonable.  He had said &quot;let</p>
<p>Him go if He will,&quot; and He had taken him at his word.  &quot;Then,&quot; he</p>
<p>says, &quot;I was always sinking whatever I did think or do.&quot;  Years</p>
<p>afterwards he remembered how, &quot;in this time of hopelessness, having</p>
<p>walked one day, to a neighbouring town, wearied out with his</p>
<p>misery, he sat down on a settle in the street to ponder over his</p>
<p>fearful state.  As he looked up, everything he saw seemed banded</p>
<p>together for the destruction of so vile a sinner.  The &quot;sun grudged</p>
<p>him its light, the very stones in the streets and the tiles on the</p>
<p>house-roofs seemed to bend themselves against him.&quot;  He burst forth</p>
<p>with a grievous sigh, &quot;How can God comfort such a wretch as I?&quot;</p>
<p>Comfort was nearer than he imagined.  &quot;No sooner had I said it, but</p>
<p>this returned to me, as an echo doth answer a voice, &#x27;This sin is</p>
<p>not unto death.&#x27;&quot;  This breathed fresh life into his soul.  He was</p>
<p>&quot;as if he had been raised out of a grave.&quot;  &quot;It was a release to me</p>
<p>from my former bonds, a shelter from my former storm.&quot;  But though</p>
<p>the storm was allayed it was by no means over.  He had to struggle</p>
<p>hard to maintain his ground.  &quot;Oh, how did Satan now lay about him</p>
<p>for to bring me down again.  But he could by no means do it, for</p>
<p>this sentence stood like a millpost at my back.&quot;  But after two</p>
<p>days the old despairing thoughts returned, &quot;nor could his faith</p>
<p>retain the word.&quot;  A few hours, however, saw the return of his</p>
<p>hopes.  As he was on his knees before going to bed, &quot;seeking the</p>
<p>Lord with strong cries,&quot; a voice echoed his prayer, &quot;I have loved</p>
<p>Thee with an everlasting love.&quot;  &quot;Now I went to bed at quiet, and</p>
<p>when I awaked the next morning it was fresh upon my soul and I</p>
<p>believed it.&quot;</p>
<p>These voices from heaven - whether real or not he could not tell,</p>
<p>nor did he much care, for they were real to him - were continually</p>
<p>sounding in his ears to help him out of the fresh crises of his</p>
<p>spiritual disorder.  At one time &quot;O man, great is thy faith,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;fastened on his heart as if one had clapped him on the back.&quot;  At</p>
<p>another, &quot;He is able,&quot; spoke suddenly and loudly within his heart;</p>
<p>at another, that &quot;piece of a sentence,&quot; &quot;My grace is sufficient,&quot;</p>
<p>darted in upon him &quot;three times together,&quot; and he was &quot;as though he</p>
<p>had seen the Lord Jesus look down through the tiles upon him,&quot; and</p>
<p>was sent mourning but rejoicing home.  But it was still with him</p>
<p>like an April sky.  At one time bright sunshine, at another</p>
<p>lowering clouds.  The terrible words about Esau &quot;returned on him as</p>
<p>before,&quot; and plunged him in darkness, and then again some good</p>
<p>words, &quot;as it seemed writ in great letters,&quot; brought back the light</p>
<p>of day.  But the sunshine began to last longer than before, and the</p>
<p>clouds were less heavy.  The &quot;visage&quot; of the threatening texts was</p>
<p>changed; &quot;they looked not on him so grimly as before;&quot; &quot;that about</p>
<p>Esau&#x27;s birthright began to wax weak and withdraw and vanish.&quot;  &quot;Now</p>
<p>remained only the hinder part of the tempest.  The thunder was</p>
<p>gone; only a few drops fell on him now and then.&quot;</p>
<p>The long-expected deliverance was at hand.  As he was walking in</p>
<p>the fields, still with some fears in his heart, the sentence fell</p>
<p>upon his soul, &quot;Thy righteousness is in heaven.&quot;  He looked up and</p>
<p>&quot;saw with the eyes of his soul our Saviour at God&#x27;s right hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There, I say, was my righteousness; so that wherever I was, or</p>
<p>whatever I was a-doing, God could not say of me, &#x27;He wants my</p>
<p>righteousness,&#x27; for that was just before Him.  Now did the chains</p>
<p>fall off from my legs.  I was loosed from my affliction and irons.</p>
<p>My temptations also fled away, so that from that time those</p>
<p>dreadful Scriptures left off to trouble me.  Oh methought Christ,</p>
<p>Christ, there was nothing but Christ that was before mine eyes.  I</p>
<p>could look from myself to Him, and should reckon that all those</p>
<p>graces of God that now were green upon me, were yet but like those</p>
<p>crack-groats, and fourpence-halfpennies that rich men carry in</p>
<p>their purses, while their gold is in their trunks at home.  Oh, I</p>
<p>saw my gold was in my trunk at home.  In Christ my Lord and</p>
<p>Saviour.  Further the Lord did lead me into the mystery of union</p>
<p>with the Son of God.  His righteousness was mine, His merits mine,</p>
<p>His victory also mine.  Now I could see myself in heaven and earth</p>
<p>at once; in heaven by my Christ, by my Head, by my Righteousness</p>
<p>and Life, though on earth by my body or person.  These blessed</p>
<p>considerations were made to spangle in mine eyes.  Christ was my</p>
<p>all; all my Wisdom, all my Righteousness, all my Sanctification,</p>
<p>and all my Redemption.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<p>The Pilgrim, having now floundered through the Slough of Despond,</p>
<p>passed through the Wicket Gate, climbed the Hill Difficulty, and</p>
<p>got safe by the Lions, entered the Palace Beautiful, and was &quot;had</p>
<p>in to the family.&quot;  In plain words, Bunyan united himself to the</p>
<p>little Christian brotherhood at Bedford, of which the former loose-</p>
<p>living royalist major, Mr. Gifford, was the pastor, and was</p>
<p>formally admitted into their society.  In Gifford we recognize the</p>
<p>prototype of the Evangelist of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress,&quot; while the</p>
<p>Prudence, Piety, and Charity of Bunyan&#x27;s immortal narrative had</p>
<p>their human representatives in devout female members of the</p>
<p>congregation, known in their little Bedford world as Sister</p>
<p>Bosworth, Sister Munnes, and Sister Fenne, three of the poor women</p>
<p>whose pleasant words on the things of God, as they sat at a doorway</p>
<p>in the sun, &quot;as if joy did make them speak,&quot; had first opened</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s eyes to his spiritual ignorance.  He was received into the</p>
<p>church by baptism, which, according to his earliest biographer,</p>
<p>Charles Doe &quot;the Struggler,&quot; was performed publicly by Mr. Gifford,</p>
<p>in the river Ouse, the &quot;Bedford river&quot; into which Bunyan tells us</p>
<p>he once fell out of a boat, and barely escaped drowning.  This was</p>
<p>about the year 1653.  The exact date is uncertain.  Bunyan never</p>
<p>mentions his baptism himself, and the church books of Gifford&#x27;s</p>
<p>congregation do not commence till May, 1656, the year after</p>
<p>Gifford&#x27;s death.  He was also admitted to the Holy Communion, which</p>
<p>for want, as he deemed, of due reverence in his first approach to</p>
<p>it, became the occasion of a temporary revival of his old</p>
<p>temptations.  While actually at the Lord&#x27;s Table he was &quot;forced to</p>
<p>bend himself to pray&quot; to be kept from uttering blasphemies against</p>
<p>the ordinance itself, and cursing his fellow communicants.  For</p>
<p>three-quarters of a year he could &quot;never have rest or ease&quot; from</p>
<p>this shocking perversity.  The constant strain of beating off this</p>
<p>persistent temptation seriously affected his health.  &quot;Captain</p>
<p>Consumption,&quot; who carried off his own &quot;Mr. Badman,&quot; threatened his</p>
<p>life.  But his naturally robust constitution &quot;routed his forces,&quot;</p>
<p>and brought him through what at one time he anticipated would prove</p>
<p>a fatal illness.  Again and again, during his period of</p>
<p>indisposition, the Tempter took advantage of his bodily weakness to</p>
<p>ply him with his former despairing questionings as to his spiritual</p>
<p>state.  That seemed as bad as bad could be.  &quot;Live he must not; die</p>
<p>he dare not.&quot;  He was repeatedly near giving up all for lost.  But</p>
<p>a few words of Scripture brought to his mind would revive his</p>
<p>drooping spirits, with a natural reaction on his physical health,</p>
<p>and he became &quot;well both in body and mind at once.&quot;  &quot;My sickness</p>
<p>did presently vanish, and I walked comfortably in my work for God</p>
<p>again.&quot;  At another time, after three or four days of deep</p>
<p>dejection, some words from the Epistle to the Hebrews &quot;came bolting</p>
<p>in upon him,&quot; and sealed his sense of acceptance with an assurance</p>
<p>he never afterwards entirely lost.  &quot;Then with joy I told my wife,</p>
<p>&#x27;Now I know, I know.&#x27;  That night was a good night to me; I never</p>
<p>had but few better.  I could scarce lie in my bed for joy and peace</p>
<p>and triumph through Christ.&quot;</p>
<p>During this time Bunyan, though a member of the Bedford</p>
<p>congregation, continued to reside at Elstow, in the little thatched</p>
<p>wayside tenement, with its lean-to forge at one end, already</p>
<p>mentioned, which is still pointed out as &quot;Bunyan&#x27;s Cottage.&quot;  There</p>
<p>his two children, Mary, his passionately loved blind daughter, and</p>
<p>Elizabeth were born; the one in 1650, and the other in 1654.  It</p>
<p>was probably in the next year, 1655, that he finally quitted his</p>
<p>native village and took up his residence in Bedford, and became a</p>
<p>deacon of the congregation.  About this time also he must have lost</p>
<p>the wife to whom he owed so much.  Bunyan does not mention the</p>
<p>event, and our only knowledge of it is from the conversation of his</p>
<p>second wife, Elizabeth, with Sir Matthew Hale.  He sustained also</p>
<p>an even greater loss in the death of his friend and comrade, Mr.</p>
<p>Gifford, who died in September, 1655.  The latter was succeeded by</p>
<p>a young man named John Burton, of very delicate health, who was</p>
<p>taken by death from his congregation, by whom he was much beloved,</p>
<p>in September, 1660, four months after the restoration of the</p>
<p>Monarchy and the Church.  Burton thoroughly appreciated Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>gifts, and stood sponsor for him on the publication of his first</p>
<p>printed work.  This was a momentous year for Bunyan, for in it Dr.</p>
<p>Brown has shown, by a &quot;comparison of dates,&quot; that we may probably</p>
<p>place the beginning of Bunyan&#x27;s ministerial life.  Bunyan was now</p>
<p>in his twenty-seventh year, in the prime of his manly vigour, with</p>
<p>a vivid imagination, ready speech, minute textual knowledge of the</p>
<p>Bible, and an experience of temptation and the wiles of the evil</p>
<p>one, such as few Christians of double his years have ever reached.</p>
<p>&quot;His gifts could not long be hid.&quot;  The beginnings of that which</p>
<p>was to prove the great work of his life were slender enough.  As</p>
<p>Mr. Froude says, &quot;he was modest, humble, shrinking.&quot;  The members</p>
<p>of his congregation, recognizing that he had &quot;the gift of</p>
<p>utterance&quot; asked him to speak &quot;a word of exhortation&quot; to them.  The</p>
<p>request scared him.  The most truly gifted are usually the least</p>
<p>conscious of their gifts.  At first it did much &quot;dash and abash his</p>
<p>spirit.&quot;  But after earnest entreaty he gave way, and made one or</p>
<p>two trials of his gift in private meetings, &quot;though with much</p>
<p>weakness and infirmity.&quot;  The result proved the correctness of his</p>
<p>brethren&#x27;s estimate.  The young tinker showed himself no common</p>
<p>preacher.  His words came home with power to the souls of his</p>
<p>hearers, who &quot;protested solemnly, as in the sight of God, that they</p>
<p>were both affected and comforted by them, and gave thanks to the</p>
<p>Father of mercies for the grace bestowed on him.&quot;  After this, as</p>
<p>the brethren went out on their itinerating rounds to the villages</p>
<p>about, they began to ask Bunyan to accompany them, and though he</p>
<p>&quot;durst not make use of his gift in an open way,&quot; he would</p>
<p>sometimes, &quot;yet more privately still, speak a word of admonition,</p>
<p>with which his hearers professed their souls edified.&quot;  That he had</p>
<p>a real Divine call to the ministry became increasingly evident,</p>
<p>both to himself and to others.  His engagements of this kind</p>
<p>multiplied.  An entry in the Church book records &quot;that Brother</p>
<p>Bunyan being taken off by the preaching of the gospel&quot; from his</p>
<p>duties as deacon, another member was appointed in his room.  His</p>
<p>appointment to the ministry was not long delayed.  After &quot;some</p>
<p>solemn prayer with fasting,&quot; he was &quot;called forth and appointed a</p>
<p>preacher of the word,&quot; not, however, so much for the Bedford</p>
<p>congregation as for the neighbouring villages.  He did not however,</p>
<p>like some, neglect his business, or forget to &quot;show piety at home.&quot;</p>
<p>He still continued his craft as a tinker, and that with industry</p>
<p>and success.  &quot;God,&quot; writes an early biographer, &quot;had increased his</p>
<p>stores so that he lived in great credit among his neighbours.&quot;  He</p>
<p>speedily became famous as a preacher.  People &quot;came in by hundreds</p>
<p>to hear the word, and that from all parts, though upon sundry and</p>
<p>divers accounts,&quot; - &quot;some,&quot; as Southey writes, &quot;to marvel, and some</p>
<p>perhaps to mock.&quot;  Curiosity to hear the once profane tinker preach</p>
<p>was not one of the least prevalent motives.  But his word proved a</p>
<p>word of power to many.  Those &quot;who came to scoff remained to pray.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had not preached long,&quot; he says, &quot;before some began to be</p>
<p>touched and to be greatly afflicted in their minds.&quot;  His success</p>
<p>humbled and amazed him, as it must every true man who compares the</p>
<p>work with the worker.  &quot;At first,&quot; he says, &quot;I could not believe</p>
<p>that God should speak by me to the heart of any man, still counting</p>
<p>myself unworthy; and though I did put it from me that they should</p>
<p>be awakened by me, still they would confess it and affirm it before</p>
<p>the saints of God.  They would also bless God for me - unworthy</p>
<p>wretch that I am - and count me God&#x27;s instrument that showed to</p>
<p>them the way of salvation.&quot;  He preached wherever he found</p>
<p>opportunity, in woods, in barns, on village greens, or even in</p>
<p>churches.  But he liked best to preach &quot;in the darkest places of</p>
<p>the country, where people were the furthest off from profession,&quot;</p>
<p>where he could give the fullest scope to &quot;the awakening and</p>
<p>converting power&quot; he possessed.  His success as a preacher might</p>
<p>have tempted him to vanity.  But the conviction that he was but an</p>
<p>instrument in the hand of a higher power kept it down.  He saw that</p>
<p>if he had gifts and wanted grace he was but as a &quot;tinkling cymbal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, thought I, shall I be proud because I am a sounding brass?</p>
<p>Is it so much to be a fiddle?&quot;  This thought was, &quot;as it were, a</p>
<p>maul on the head of the pride and vainglory&quot; which he found &quot;easily</p>
<p>blown up at the applause and commendation of every unadvised</p>
<p>christian.&quot;  His experiences, like those of every public speaker,</p>
<p>especially the most eloquent, were very varied, even in the course</p>
<p>of the same sermon.  Sometimes, he tells us, he would begin &quot;with</p>
<p>much clearness, evidence, and liberty of speech,&quot; but, before he</p>
<p>had done, he found himself &quot;so straitened in his speech before the</p>
<p>people,&quot; that he &quot;scarce knew or remembered what he had been</p>
<p>about,&quot; and felt &quot;as if his head had been in a bag all the time of</p>
<p>the exercise.&quot;  He feared that he would not be able to &quot;speak sense</p>
<p>to the hearers,&quot; or he would be &quot;seized with such faintness and</p>
<p>strengthlessness that his legs were hardly able to carry him to his</p>
<p>place of preaching.&quot;  Old temptations too came back.  Blasphemous</p>
<p>thoughts formed themselves into words, which he had hard work to</p>
<p>keep himself from uttering from the pulpit.  Or the tempter tried</p>
<p>to silence him by telling him that what he was going to say would</p>
<p>condemn himself, and he would go &quot;full of guilt and terror even to</p>
<p>the pulpit door.&quot;  &quot;&#x27;What,&#x27; the devil would say, &#x27;will you preach</p>
<p>this?  Of this your own soul is guilty.  Preach not of it at all,</p>
<p>or if you do, yet so mince it as to make way for your own escape.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>All, however, was in vain.  Necessity was laid upon him.  &quot;Woe,&quot; he</p>
<p>cried, &quot;is me, if I preach not the gospel.&quot;  His heart was &quot;so</p>
<p>wrapped up in the glory of this excellent work, that he counted</p>
<p>himself more blessed and honoured of God than if he had made him</p>
<p>emperor of the Christian world.&quot;  Bunyan was no preacher of vague</p>
<p>generalities.  He knew that sermons miss their mark if they hit no</p>
<p>one.  Self-application is their object.  &quot;Wherefore,&quot; he says, &quot;I</p>
<p>laboured so to speak the word, as that the sin and person guilty</p>
<p>might be particularized by it.&quot;  And what he preached he knew and</p>
<p>felt to be true.  It was not what he read in books, but what he had</p>
<p>himself experienced.  Like Dante he had been in hell himself, and</p>
<p>could speak as one who knew its terrors, and could tell also of the</p>
<p>blessedness of deliverance by the person and work of Christ.  And</p>
<p>this consciousness gave him confidence and courage in declaring his</p>
<p>message.  It was &quot;as if an angel of God had stood at my back.&quot;  &quot;Oh</p>
<p>it hath been with such power and heavenly evidence upon my own soul</p>
<p>while I have been labouring to fasten it upon the conscience of</p>
<p>others, that I could not be contented with saying, &#x27;I believe and</p>
<p>am sure.&#x27;  Methought I was more than sure, if it be lawful so to</p>
<p>express myself, that the things I asserted were true.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan, like all earnest workers for God, had his disappointments</p>
<p>which wrung his heart.  He could be satisfied with nothing less</p>
<p>than the conversion and sanctification of his hearers.  &quot;If I were</p>
<p>fruitless, it mattered not who commanded me; but if I were</p>
<p>fruitful, I cared not who did condemn.&quot;  And the result of a sermon</p>
<p>was often very different from what he anticipated:  &quot;When I thought</p>
<p>I had done no good, then I did the most; and when I thought I</p>
<p>should catch them, I fished for nothing.&quot;  &quot;A word cast in by-the-</p>
<p>bye sometimes did more execution than all the Sermon besides.&quot;  The</p>
<p>tie between him and his spiritual children was very close.  The</p>
<p>backsliding of any of his converts caused him the most extreme</p>
<p>grief; &quot;it was more to me than if one of my own children were going</p>
<p>to the grave.  Nothing hath gone so near me as that, unless it was</p>
<p>the fear of the loss of the salvation of my own soul.&quot;</p>
<p>A story, often repeated, but too characteristic to be omitted,</p>
<p>illustrates the power of his preaching even in the early days of</p>
<p>his ministry.  &quot;Being to preach in a church in a country village in</p>
<p>Cambridgeshire&quot; - it was before the Restoration - &quot;and the public</p>
<p>being gathered together in the churchyard, a Cambridge scholar, and</p>
<p>none of the soberest neither, inquired what the meaning of that</p>
<p>concourse of people was (it being a week-day); and being told that</p>
<p>one Bunyan, a tinker, was to preach there, he gave a lad twopence</p>
<p>to hold his horse, saying he was resolved to hear the tinker prate;</p>
<p>and so he went into the church to hear him.  But God met him there</p>
<p>by His ministry, so that he came out much changed; and would by his</p>
<p>good will hear none but the tinker for a long time after, he</p>
<p>himself becoming a very eminent preacher in that country</p>
<p>afterwards.&quot;  &quot;This story,&quot; continues the anonymous biographer, &quot;I</p>
<p>know to be true, having many times discoursed with the man.&quot;  To</p>
<p>the same ante-Restoration period, Dr. Brown also assigns the</p>
<p>anecdote of Bunyan&#x27;s encounter, on the road near Cambridge, with</p>
<p>the university man who asked him how he dared to preach not having</p>
<p>the original Scriptures.  With ready wit, Bunyan turned the tables</p>
<p>on the scholar by asking whether he had the actual originals, the</p>
<p>copies written by the apostles and prophets.  The scholar replied,</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; but they had what they believed to be a true copy of the</p>
<p>original.  &quot;And I,&quot; said Bunyan, &quot;believe the English Bible to be a</p>
<p>true copy, too.&quot;  &quot;Then away rid the scholar.&quot;</p>
<p>The fame of such a preacher, naturally, soon spread far and wide;</p>
<p>all the countryside flocked eagerly to hear him.  In some places,</p>
<p>as at Meldreth in Cambridgeshire, and Yelden in his own county of</p>
<p>Bedfordshire, the pulpits of the parish churches were opened to</p>
<p>him.  At Yelden, the Rector, Dr. William Dell, the Puritan Master</p>
<p>of Caius College, Cambridge, formerly Chaplain to the army under</p>
<p>Fairfax, roused the indignation of his orthodox parishioners by</p>
<p>allowing him - &quot;one Bunyon of Bedford, a tinker,&quot; as he is</p>
<p>ignominiously styled in the petition sent up to the House of Lords</p>
<p>in 1660 - to preach in his parish church on Christmas Day.  But,</p>
<p>generally, the parochial clergy were his bitterest enemies.  &quot;When</p>
<p>I first went to preach the word abroad,&quot; he writes, &quot;the Doctors</p>
<p>and priests of the country did open wide against me.&quot;  Many were</p>
<p>envious of his success where they had so signally failed.  In the</p>
<p>words of Mr. Henry Deane, when defending Bunyan against the attacks</p>
<p>of Dr. T. Smith, Professor of Arabic and Keeper of the University</p>
<p>Library at Cambridge, who had come upon Bunyan preaching in a barn</p>
<p>at Toft, they were &quot;angry with the tinker because he strove to mend</p>
<p>souls as well as kettles and pans,&quot; and proved himself more skilful</p>
<p>in his craft than those who had graduated at a university.  Envy is</p>
<p>ever the mother of detraction.  Slanders of the blackest dye</p>
<p>against his moral character were freely circulated, and as readily</p>
<p>believed.  It was the common talk that he was a thorough reprobate.</p>
<p>Nothing was too bad for him.  He was &quot;a witch, a Jesuit, a</p>
<p>highwayman, and the like.&quot;  It was reported that he had &quot;his misses</p>
<p>and his bastards; that he had two wives at once,&quot; &amp;c.  Such charges</p>
<p>roused all the man in Bunyan.  Few passages in his writings show</p>
<p>more passion than that in &quot;Grace Abounding,&quot; in which he defends</p>
<p>himself from the &quot;fools or knaves&quot; who were their authors.  He</p>
<p>&quot;begs belief of no man, and if they believe him or disbelieve him</p>
<p>it is all one to him.  But he would have them know how utterly</p>
<p>baseless their accusations are.&quot;  &quot;My foes,&quot; he writes, &quot;have</p>
<p>missed their mark in their open shooting at me.  I am not the man.</p>
<p>If all the fornicators and adulterers in England were hanged by the</p>
<p>neck till they be dead, John Bunyan would be still alive.  I know</p>
<p>not whether there is such a thing as a woman breathing under the</p>
<p>copes of the whole heaven but by their apparel, their children, or</p>
<p>by common fame, except my wife.&quot;  He calls not only men, but</p>
<p>angels, nay, even God Himself, to bear testimony to his innocence</p>
<p>in this respect.  But though they were so absolutely baseless, nay,</p>
<p>the rather because they were so baseless, the grossness of these</p>
<p>charges evidently stung Bunyan very deeply.</p>
<p>So bitter was the feeling aroused against him by the marvellous</p>
<p>success of his irregular ministry, that his enemies, even before</p>
<p>the restoration of the Church and Crown, endeavoured to put the arm</p>
<p>of the law in motion to restrain him.  We learn from the church</p>
<p>books that in March, 1658, the little Bedford church was in trouble</p>
<p>for &quot;Brother Bunyan,&quot; against whom an indictment had been laid at</p>
<p>the Assizes for &quot;preaching at Eaton Socon.&quot;  Of this indictment we</p>
<p>hear no more; so it was probably dropped.  But it is an instructive</p>
<p>fact that, even during the boasted religious liberty of the</p>
<p>Protectorate, irregular preaching, especially that of the much</p>
<p>dreaded Anabaptists, was an indictable offence.  But, as Dr. Brown</p>
<p>observes, &quot;religious liberty had not yet come to mean liberty all</p>
<p>round, but only liberty for a certain recognized section of</p>
<p>Christians.&quot;  That there was no lack of persecution during the</p>
<p>Commonwealth is clear from the cruel treatment to which Quakers</p>
<p>were subjected, to say nothing of the intolerance shown to</p>
<p>Episcopalians and Roman Catholics.  In Bunyan&#x27;s own county of</p>
<p>Bedford, Quakeresses were sentenced to be whipped and sent to</p>
<p>Bridewell for reproving a parish priest, perhaps well deserving of</p>
<p>it, and exhorting the folks on a market day to repentance and</p>
<p>amendment of life.  &quot;The simple truth is,&quot; writes Robert Southey,</p>
<p>&quot;all parties were agreed on the one catholic opinion that certain</p>
<p>doctrines were not to be tolerated:&quot; the only points of difference</p>
<p>between them were &quot;what those doctrines were,&quot; and how far</p>
<p>intolerance might be carried.  The withering lines are familiar to</p>
<p>us, in which Milton denounces the &quot;New Forcers of Conscience,&quot; who</p>
<p>by their intolerance and &quot;super-metropolitan and</p>
<p>hyperarchiepiscopal tyranny,&quot; proved that in his proverbial words,</p>
<p>&quot;New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large&quot; -</p>
<p>&quot;Because you have thrown off your prelate lord,</p>
<p>And with stiff vows renounce his liturgy</p>
<p>Dare ye for this adjure the civil sword</p>
<p>To force our consciences that Christ set free!&quot;</p>
<p>How Bunyan came to escape we know not.  But the danger he was in</p>
<p>was imminent enough for the church at Bedford to meet to pray &quot;for</p>
<p>counsail what to doe&quot; in respect of it.</p>
<p>It was in these closing years of the Protectorate that Bunyan made</p>
<p>his first essay at authorship.  He was led to it by a long and</p>
<p>tiresome controversy with the Quakers, who had recently found their</p>
<p>way to Bedford.  The foundations of the faith, he thought, were</p>
<p>being undermined.  The Quakers&#x27; teaching as to the inward light</p>
<p>seemed to him a serious disparagement of the Holy Scriptures, while</p>
<p>their mystical view of the spiritual Christ revealed to the soul</p>
<p>and dwelling in the heart, came perilously near to a denial of the</p>
<p>historic reality of the personal Christ.  He had had public</p>
<p>disputations with male and female Quakers from time to time, at the</p>
<p>Market Cross at Bedford, at &quot;Paul&#x27;s Steeple-house in Bedford town,&quot;</p>
<p>and other places.  One of them, Anne Blackley by name, openly bade</p>
<p>him throw away the Scriptures, to which Bunyan replied, &quot;No; for</p>
<p>then the devil would be too hard for me.&quot;  The same enthusiast</p>
<p>charged him with &quot;preaching up an idol, and using conjuration and</p>
<p>witchcraft,&quot; because of his assertion of the bodily presence of</p>
<p>Christ in heaven.</p>
<p>The first work of one who was to prove himself so voluminous an</p>
<p>author, cannot but be viewed with much interest.  It was a little</p>
<p>volume in duodecimo, of about two hundred pages, entitled &quot;Some</p>
<p>Gospel Truths Opened, by that unworthy servant of Christ, John</p>
<p>Bunyan, of Bedford, by the Grace of God, preacher of the Gospel of</p>
<p>His dear Son,&quot; published in 1656.  The little book, which, as Dr.</p>
<p>Brown says, was &quot;evidently thrown off at a heat,&quot; was printed in</p>
<p>London and published at Newport Pagnel.  Bunyan being entirely</p>
<p>unknown to the world, his first literary venture was introduced by</p>
<p>a commendatory &quot;Epistle&quot; written by Gifford&#x27;s successor, John</p>
<p>Burton.  In this Burton speaks of the young author - Bunyan was</p>
<p>only in his twenty-ninth year - as one who had &quot;neither the</p>
<p>greatness nor the wisdom of the world to commend him,&quot; &quot;not being</p>
<p>chosen out of an earthly but out of a heavenly university, the</p>
<p>Church of Christ,&quot; where &quot;through grace he had taken three heavenly</p>
<p>degrees, to wit, union with Christ, the anointing of the Spirit,</p>
<p>and experience of the temptations of Satan,&quot; and as one of whose</p>
<p>&quot;soundness in the faith, godly conversation, and his ability to</p>
<p>preach the Gospel, not by human aid, but by the Spirit of the</p>
<p>Lord,&quot; he &quot;with many other saints had had experience.&quot;  This book</p>
<p>must be pronounced a very remarkable production for a young</p>
<p>travelling tinker, under thirty, and without any literary or</p>
<p>theological training but such as he had gained for himself after</p>
<p>attaining to manhood.  Its arrangement is excellent, the arguments</p>
<p>are ably marshalled, the style is clear, the language pure and well</p>
<p>chosen.  It is, in the main, a well-reasoned defence of the</p>
<p>historical truth of the Articles of the Creed relating to the</p>
<p>Second Person of the Trinity, against the mystical teaching of the</p>
<p>followers of George Fox, who, by a false spiritualism, sublimated</p>
<p>the whole Gospel narrative into a vehicle for the representation of</p>
<p>truths relating to the inner life of the believer.  No one ever had</p>
<p>a firmer grasp than Bunyan of the spiritual bearing of the facts of</p>
<p>the recorded life of Christ on the souls of men.  But he would not</p>
<p>suffer their &quot;subjectivity&quot; - to adopt modern terms - to destroy</p>
<p>their &quot;objectivity.&quot;  If the Son of God was not actually born of</p>
<p>the Virgin Mary, if He did not live in a real human body, and in</p>
<p>that body die, lie in the grave, rise again, and ascend up into</p>
<p>heaven, whence He would return - and that Bunyan believed shortly -</p>
<p>in the same Body He took of His mortal mother, His preaching was</p>
<p>vain; their faith was vain; they were yet in their sins.  Those who</p>
<p>&quot;cried up a Christ within, IN OPPOSITION to a Christ without,&quot; who</p>
<p>asserted that Christ had no other Body but the Church, that the</p>
<p>only Crucifixion, rising again, and ascension of Christ was that</p>
<p>WITHIN the believer, and that every man had, as an inner light, a</p>
<p>measure of Christ&#x27;s Spirit within him sufficient to guide him to</p>
<p>salvation, he asserted were &quot;possessed with a spirit of delusion;&quot;</p>
<p>deceived themselves, they were deceiving others to their eternal</p>
<p>ruin.  To the refutation of such fundamental errors, substituting a</p>
<p>mystical for an historical faith, Bunyan&#x27;s little treatise is</p>
<p>addressed; and it may be truly said the work is done effectually.</p>
<p>To adopt Coleridge&#x27;s expression concerning Bunyan&#x27;s greater and</p>
<p>world-famous work, it is an admirable &quot;SUMMA THEOLOIAE</p>
<p>EVANGELICAE,&quot; which, notwithstanding its obsolete style and old-</p>
<p>fashioned arrangement, may be read even now with advantage.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s denunciation of the tenets of the Quakers speedily</p>
<p>elicited a reply.  This was written by a certain Edward Burrough, a</p>
<p>young man of three and twenty, fearless, devoted, and ardent in the</p>
<p>propagation of the tenets of his sect.  Being subsequently thrown</p>
<p>into Newgate with hundreds of his co-religionists, at the same time</p>
<p>that his former antagonist was imprisoned in Bedford Gaol, Burrough</p>
<p>met the fate Bunyan&#x27;s stronger constitution enabled him to escape;</p>
<p>and in the language of the times, &quot;rotted in prison,&quot; a victim to</p>
<p>the loathsome foulness of his place of incarceration, in the year</p>
<p>of the &quot;Bartholomew Act,&quot; 1662.</p>
<p>Burrough entitled his reply, &quot;The Gospel of Peace, contended for in</p>
<p>the Spirit of Meekness and Love against the secret opposition of</p>
<p>John Bunyan, a professed minister in Bedfordshire.&quot;  His opening</p>
<p>words, too characteristic of the entire treatise, display but</p>
<p>little of the meekness professed.  &quot;How long, ye crafty fowlers,</p>
<p>will ye prey upon the innocent?  How long shall the righteous be a</p>
<p>prey to your teeth, ye subtle foxes!  Your dens are in darkness,</p>
<p>and your mischief is hatched upon your beds of secret whoredoms?&quot;</p>
<p>Of John Burton and the others who recommended Bunyan&#x27;s treatise, he</p>
<p>says, &quot;They have joined themselves with the broken army of Magog,</p>
<p>and have showed themselves in the defence of the dragon against the</p>
<p>Lamb in the day of war betwixt them.&quot;  We may well echo Dr. Brown&#x27;s</p>
<p>wish that &quot;these two good men could have had a little free and</p>
<p>friendly talk face to face.  There would probably have been better</p>
<p>understanding, and fewer hard words, for they were really not so</p>
<p>far apart as they thought.  Bunyan believed in the inward light,</p>
<p>and Burrough surely accepted an objective Christ.  But failing to</p>
<p>see each other&#x27;s exact point of view, Burrough thunders at Bunyan,</p>
<p>and Bunyan swiftly returns the shot.&quot;</p>
<p>The rapidity of Bunyan&#x27;s literary work is amazing, especially when</p>
<p>we take his antecedents into account.  Within a few weeks he</p>
<p>published his rejoinder to Friend Burrough, under the title of &quot;A</p>
<p>Vindication of Gospel Truths Opened.&quot;  In this work, which appeared</p>
<p>in 1667, Bunyan repays Burrough in his own coin, styling him &quot;a</p>
<p>proved enemy to the truth,&quot; a &quot;grossly railing Rabshakeh, who</p>
<p>breaks out with a taunt and a jeer,&quot; is very &quot;censorious and utters</p>
<p>many words without knowledge.&quot;  In vigorous, nervous language,</p>
<p>which does not spare his opponent, he defends himself from</p>
<p>Burrough&#x27;s charges, and proves that the Quakers are &quot;deceivers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for you thinking that to drink water, and wear no hatbands is</p>
<p>not walking after your own lusts, I say that whatsoever man do make</p>
<p>a religion out of, having no warrant for it in Scripture, is but</p>
<p>walking after their own lusts, and not after the Spirit of God.&quot;</p>
<p>Burrough had most unwarrantably stigmatized Bunyan as one of &quot;the</p>
<p>false prophets, who love the wages of unrighteousness, and through</p>
<p>covetousness make merchandise of souls.&quot;  Bunyan calmly replies,</p>
<p>&quot;Friend, dost thou speak this as from thy own knowledge, or did any</p>
<p>other tell thee so?  However that spirit that led thee out this way</p>
<p>is a lying spirit.  For though I be poor and of no repute in the</p>
<p>world as to outward things, yet through grace I have learned by the</p>
<p>example of the Apostle to preach the truth, and also to work with</p>
<p>my hands both for mine own living, and for those that are with me,</p>
<p>when I have opportunity.  And I trust that the Lord Jesus who bath</p>
<p>helped me to reject the wages of unrighteousness hitherto, will</p>
<p>also help me still so that I shall distribute that which God hath</p>
<p>given me freely, and not for filthy lucre&#x27;s sake.&quot;  The</p>
<p>fruitfulness of his ministry which Burrough had called in question,</p>
<p>charging him with having &quot;run before he was sent,&quot; he refuses to</p>
<p>discuss.  Bunyan says, &quot;I shall leave it to be taken notice of by</p>
<p>the people of God and the country where I dwell, who will testify</p>
<p>the contrary for me, setting aside the carnal ministry with their</p>
<p>retinue who are so mad against me as thyself.&quot;</p>
<p>In his third book, published in 1658, at &quot;the King&#x27;s Head, in the</p>
<p>Old Bailey,&quot; a few days before Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s death, Bunyan left</p>
<p>the thorny domain of polemics, for that of Christian exhortation,</p>
<p>in which his chief work was to be done.  This work was an</p>
<p>exposition of the parable of &quot;the Rich Man and Lazarus,&quot; bearing</p>
<p>the horror-striking title, &quot;A Few Sighs from Hell, or the Groans of</p>
<p>a Damned Soul.&quot;  In this work, as its title would suggest, Bunyan,</p>
<p>accepting the literal accuracy of the parable as a description of</p>
<p>the realities of the world beyond the grave, gives full scope to</p>
<p>his vivid imagination in portraying the condition of the lost.  It</p>
<p>contains some touches of racy humour, especially in the similes,</p>
<p>and is written in the nervous homespun English of which he was</p>
<p>master.  Its popularity is shown by its having gone through nine</p>
<p>editions in the author&#x27;s lifetime.  To take an example or two of</p>
<p>its style:  dealing with the excuses people make for not hearing</p>
<p>the Gospel, &quot;O, saith one, I dare not for my master, my brother, my</p>
<p>landlord; I shall lose his favour, his house of work, and so decay</p>
<p>my calling.  O, saith another, I would willingly go in this way but</p>
<p>for my father; he chides me and tells me he will not stand my</p>
<p>friend when I come to want; I shall never enjoy a pennyworth of his</p>
<p>goods; he will disinherit me - And I dare not, saith another, for</p>
<p>my husband, for he will be a-railing, and tells me he will turn me</p>
<p>out of doors, he will beat me and cut off my legs;&quot; and then</p>
<p>turning from the hindered to the hinderers:  &quot;Oh, what red lines</p>
<p>will there be against all those rich ungodly landlords that so keep</p>
<p>under their poor tenants that they dare not go out to hear the word</p>
<p>for fear that their rent should be raised or they turned out of</p>
<p>their houses.  Think on this, you drunken proud rich, and scornful</p>
<p>landlords; think on this, you madbrained blasphemous husbands, that</p>
<p>are against the godly and chaste conversation of your wives; also</p>
<p>you that hold your servants so hard to it that you will not spare</p>
<p>them time to hear the Word, unless it will be where and when your</p>
<p>lusts will let you.&quot;  He bids the ungodly consider that &quot;the</p>
<p>profits, pleasures, and vanities of the world&quot; will one day &quot;give</p>
<p>thee the slip, and leave thee in the sands and the brambles of all</p>
<p>that thou hast done.&quot;  The careless man lies &quot;like the smith&#x27;s dog</p>
<p>at the foot of the anvil, though the fire sparks flee in his face.&quot;</p>
<p>The rich man remembers how he once despised Lazarus, &quot;scrubbed</p>
<p>beggarly Lazarus.  What, shall I dishonour my fair sumptuous and</p>
<p>gay house with such a scabbed creephedge as he?  The Lazaruses are</p>
<p>not allowed to warn them of the wrath to come, because they are not</p>
<p>gentlemen, because they cannot with Pontius Pilate speak Hebrew,</p>
<p>Greek, and Latin.  Nay, they must not, shall not, speak to them,</p>
<p>and all because of this.&quot;</p>
<p>The fourth production of Bunyan&#x27;s pen, his last book before his</p>
<p>twelve years of prison life began, is entitled, &quot;The Doctrine of</p>
<p>Law and Grace Unfolded.&quot;  With a somewhat overstrained humility</p>
<p>which is hardly worthy of him, he describes himself in the title-</p>
<p>page as &quot;that poor contemptible creature John Bunyan, of Bedford.&quot;</p>
<p>It was given to the world in May, 1659, and issued from the same</p>
<p>press in the Old Bailey as his last work.  It cannot be said that</p>
<p>this is one of Bunyan&#x27;s most attractive writings.  It is as he</p>
<p>describes it, &quot;a parcel of plain yet sound, true, and home</p>
<p>sayings,&quot; in which with that clearness of thought and accuracy of</p>
<p>arrangement which belongs to him, and that marvellous acquaintance</p>
<p>with Scripture language which he had gained by his constant study</p>
<p>of the Bible, he sets forth the two covenants - the covenant of</p>
<p>works, and the covenant of Grace - &quot;in their natures, ends, bounds,</p>
<p>together with the state and condition of them that are under the</p>
<p>one, and of them that are under the other.&quot;  Dr. Brown describes</p>
<p>the book as &quot;marked by a firm grasp of faith and a strong view of</p>
<p>the reality of Christ&#x27;s person and work as the one Priest and</p>
<p>Mediator for a sinful world.&quot;  To quote a passage, &quot;Is there</p>
<p>righteousness in Christ? that is mine.  Is there perfection in that</p>
<p>righteousness? that is mine.  Did He bleed for sin?  It was for</p>
<p>mine.  Hath He overcome the law, the devil, and hell?  The victory</p>
<p>is mine, and I am come forth conqueror, nay, more than a conqueror</p>
<p>through Him that hath loved me. . . Lord, show me continually in</p>
<p>the light of Thy Spirit, through Thy word, that Jesus that was born</p>
<p>in the days of Caesar Augustus, when Mary, a daughter of Judah,</p>
<p>went with Joseph to be taxed in Bethlehem, that He is the very</p>
<p>Christ.  Let me not rest contented without such a faith that is so</p>
<p>wrought even by the discovery of His Birth, Crucifying Death,</p>
<p>Blood, Resurrection, Ascension, and Second - which is His Personal</p>
<ul>
<li>Coming again, that the very faith of it may fill my soul with</li>
</ul>
<p>comfort and holiness.&quot;  Up and down its pages we meet with vivid</p>
<p>reminiscences of his own career, of which he can only speak with</p>
<p>wonder and thankfulness.  In the &quot;Epistle to the Reader,&quot; which</p>
<p>introduces it, occurs the passage already referred to describing</p>
<p>his education.  &quot;I never went to school to Aristotle or Plato, but</p>
<p>was brought up at my father&#x27;s house in a very mean condition, among</p>
<p>a company of poor countrymen.&quot;  Of his own religious state before</p>
<p>his conversion he thus speaks:  &quot;When it pleased the Lord to begin</p>
<p>to instruct my soul, He found me one of the black sinners of the</p>
<p>world.  He found me making a sport of oaths, and also of lies; and</p>
<p>many a soul-poisoning meal did I make out of divers lusts, such as</p>
<p>drinking, dancing, playing, pleasure with the wicked ones of the</p>
<p>world; and so wedded was I to my sins, that thought I to myself, &#x27;I</p>
<p>will have them though I lose my soul.&#x27;&quot;  And then, after narrating</p>
<p>the struggles he had had with his conscience, the alternations of</p>
<p>hope and fear which he passed through, which are more fully</p>
<p>described in his &quot;Grace Abounding,&quot; he thus vividly depicts the</p>
<p>full assurance of faith he had attained to:  &quot;I saw through grace</p>
<p>that it was the Blood shed on Mount Calvary that did save and</p>
<p>redeem sinners, as clearly and as really with the eyes of my soul</p>
<p>as ever, methought, I had seen a penny loaf bought with a penny. .</p>
<p>. O let the saints know that unless the devil can pluck Christ out</p>
<p>of heaven he cannot pull a true believer out of Christ.&quot;  In a</p>
<p>striking passage he shows how, by turning Satan&#x27;s temptations</p>
<p>against himself, Christians may &quot;Get the art as to outrun him in</p>
<p>his own shoes, and make his own darts pierce himself.&quot;  &quot;What!</p>
<p>didst thou never learn to outshoot the devil in his own bow, and</p>
<p>cut off his head with his own sword as David served Goliath?&quot;  The</p>
<p>whole treatise is somewhat wearisome, but the pious reader will</p>
<p>find much in it for spiritual edification.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>We cannot doubt that one in whom loyalty was so deep and fixed a</p>
<p>principle as Bunyan, would welcome with sincere thankfulness the</p>
<p>termination of the miserable interval of anarchy which followed the</p>
<p>death of the Protector and the abdication of his indolent and</p>
<p>feeble son, by the restoration of monarchy in the person of Charles</p>
<p>the Second.  Even if some forebodings might have arisen that with</p>
<p>the restoration of the old monarchy the old persecuting laws might</p>
<p>be revived, which made it criminal for a man to think for himself</p>
<p>in the matters which most nearly concerned his eternal interests,</p>
<p>and to worship in the way which he found most helpful to his</p>
<p>spiritual life, they would have been silenced by the promise,</p>
<p>contained in Charles&#x27;s &quot;Declaration from Breda,&quot; of liberty to</p>
<p>tender consciences, and the assurance that no one should be</p>
<p>disquieted for differences of opinion in religion, so long as such</p>
<p>differences did not endanger the peace and well-being of the realm.</p>
<p>If this declaration meant anything, it meant a breadth of</p>
<p>toleration larger and more liberal than had been ever granted by</p>
<p>Cromwell.  Any fears of the renewal of persecution must be</p>
<p>groundless.</p>
<p>But if such dreams of religious liberty were entertained they were</p>
<p>speedily and rudely dispelled, and Bunyan was one of the first to</p>
<p>feel the shock of the awakening.  The promise was coupled with a</p>
<p>reference to the &quot;mature deliberation of Parliament.&quot;  With such a</p>
<p>promise Charles&#x27;s easy conscience was relieved of all</p>
<p>responsibility.  Whatever he might promise, the nation, and</p>
<p>Parliament which was its mouthpiece, might set his promise aside.</p>
<p>And if he knew anything of the temper of the people he was</p>
<p>returning to govern, he must have felt assured that any scheme of</p>
<p>comprehension was certain to be rejected by them.  As Mr. Froude</p>
<p>has said, &quot;before toleration is possible, men must have learnt to</p>
<p>tolerate toleration,&quot; and this was a lesson the English nation was</p>
<p>very far from having learnt; at no time, perhaps, were they further</p>
<p>from it.  Puritanism had had its day, and had made itself generally</p>
<p>detested.  Deeply enshrined as it was in many earnest and devout</p>
<p>hearts, such as Bunyan&#x27;s, it was necessarily the religion not of</p>
<p>the many, but of the few; it was the religion not of the common</p>
<p>herd, but of a spiritual aristocracy.  Its stern condemnation of</p>
<p>all mirth and pastime, as things in their nature sinful, of which</p>
<p>we have so many evidences in Bunyan&#x27;s own writings; its repression</p>
<p>of all that makes life brighter and more joyous, and the sour</p>
<p>sanctimoniousness which frowned upon innocent relaxation, had</p>
<p>rendered its yoke unbearable to ordinary human nature, and men took</p>
<p>the earliest opportunity of throwing the yoke off and trampling it</p>
<p>under foot.  They hailed with rude and boisterous rejoicings the</p>
<p>restoration of the Monarchy which they felt, with a true instinct,</p>
<p>involved the restoration of the old Church of England, the church</p>
<p>of their fathers and of the older among themselves, with its larger</p>
<p>indulgence for the instincts of humanity, its wider</p>
<p>comprehensiveness, and its more dignified and decorous ritual.</p>
<p>The reaction from Puritanism pervaded all ranks.  In no class,</p>
<p>however, was its influence more powerful than among the country</p>
<p>gentry.  Most of them had been severe sufferers both in purse and</p>
<p>person during the Protectorate.  Fines and sequestrations had</p>
<p>fallen heavily upon them, and they were eager to retaliate on their</p>
<p>oppressors.  Their turn had come; can we wonder that they were</p>
<p>eager to use it?  As Mr. J. R. Green has said:  &quot;The Puritan, the</p>
<p>Presbyterian, the Commonwealthsman, all were at their feet. . .</p>
<p>Their whole policy appeared to be dictated by a passionate spirit</p>
<p>of reaction. . . The oppressors of the parson had been the</p>
<p>oppressors of the squire.  The sequestrator who had driven the one</p>
<p>from his parsonage had driven the other from his manor-house.  Both</p>
<p>had been branded with the same charge of malignity.  Both had</p>
<p>suffered together, and the new Parliament was resolved that both</p>
<p>should triumph together.&quot;</p>
<p>The feeling thus eloquently expressed goes far to explain the</p>
<p>harshness which Bunyan experienced at the hands of the</p>
<p>administrators of justice at the crisis of his life at which we</p>
<p>have now arrived.  Those before whom he was successively arraigned</p>
<p>belonged to this very class, which, having suffered most severely</p>
<p>during the Puritan usurpation, was least likely to show</p>
<p>consideration to a leading teacher of the Puritan body.  Nor were</p>
<p>reasons wanting to justify their severity.  The circumstances of</p>
<p>the times were critical.  The public mind was still in an excitable</p>
<p>state, agitated by the wild schemes of political and religious</p>
<p>enthusiasts plotting to destroy the whole existing framework both</p>
<p>of Church and State, and set up their own chimerical fabric.  We</p>
<p>cannot be surprised that, as Southey has said, after all the nation</p>
<p>had suffered from fanatical zeal, &quot;The government, rendered</p>
<p>suspicious by the constant sense of danger, was led as much by fear</p>
<p>as by resentment to seventies which are explained by the</p>
<p>necessities of self-defence,&quot; and which the nervous apprehensions</p>
<p>of the nation not only condoned, but incited.  Already Churchmen in</p>
<p>Wales had been taking the law into their own hands, and manifesting</p>
<p>their orthodoxy by harrying Quakers and Nonconformists.  In the May</p>
<p>and June of this year, we hear of sectaries being taken from their</p>
<p>beds and haled to prison, and brought manacled to the Quarter</p>
<p>Sessions and committed to loathsome dungeons.  Matters had advanced</p>
<p>since then.  The Church had returned in its full power and</p>
<p>privileges together with the monarchy, and everything went back</p>
<p>into its old groove.  Every Act passed for the disestablishment and</p>
<p>disendowment of the Church was declared a dead letter.  Those of</p>
<p>the ejected incumbents who remained alive entered again into their</p>
<p>parsonages, and occupied their pulpits as of old; the surviving</p>
<p>bishops returned to their sees; and the whole existing statute law</p>
<p>regarding the Church revived from its suspended animation.  No new</p>
<p>enactment was required to punish Nonconformists and to silence</p>
<p>their ministers; though, to the disgrace of the nation and its</p>
<p>parliament, many new ones were subsequently passed, with ever-</p>
<p>increasing disabilities.  The various Acts of Elizabeth supplied</p>
<p>all that was needed.  Under these Acts all who refused to attend</p>
<p>public worship in their parish churches were subject to fines;</p>
<p>while those who resorted to conventicles were to be imprisoned till</p>
<p>they made their submissions; if at the end of three months they</p>
<p>refused to submit they were to be banished the realm, and if they</p>
<p>returned from banishment, without permission of the Crown, they</p>
<p>were liable to execution as felons.  This long-disused sword was</p>
<p>now drawn from its rusty sheath to strike terror into the hearts of</p>
<p>Nonconformists.  It did not prove very effectual.  All the true-</p>
<p>hearted men preferred to suffer rather than yield in so sacred a</p>
<p>cause.  Bunyan was one of the earliest of these, as he proved one</p>
<p>of the staunchest.</p>
<p>Early in October, 1660, the country magistrates meeting in Bedford</p>
<p>issued an order for the public reading of the Liturgy of the Church</p>
<p>of England.  Such an order Bunyan would not regard as concerning</p>
<p>him.  Anyhow he would not give obeying it a thought.  One of the</p>
<p>things we least like in Bunyan is the feeling he exhibits towards</p>
<p>the Book of Common Prayer.  To him it was an accursed thing, the</p>
<p>badge and token of a persecuting party, a relic of popery which he</p>
<p>exhorted his adherents to &quot;take heed that they touched not&quot; if they</p>
<p>would be &quot;steadfast in the faith of Jesus Christ.&quot;  Nothing could</p>
<p>be further from his thoughts than to give any heed to the</p>
<p>magistrates&#x27; order to go to church and pray &quot;after the form of</p>
<p>men&#x27;s inventions.&quot;</p>
<p>The time for testing Bunyan&#x27;s resolution was now near at hand.</p>
<p>Within six months of the king&#x27;s landing, within little more than a</p>
<p>month of the issue of the magistrate&#x27;s order for the use of the</p>
<p>Common Prayer Book, his sturdy determination to yield obedience to</p>
<p>no authority in spiritual matters but that of his own conscience</p>
<p>was put to the proof.  Bunyan may safely be regarded as at that</p>
<p>time the most conspicuous of the Nonconformists of the</p>
<p>neighbourhood.  He had now preached for five or six years with</p>
<p>ever-growing popularity.  No name was so rife in men&#x27;s mouths as</p>
<p>his.  At him, therefore, as the representative of his brother</p>
<p>sectaries, the first blow was levelled.  It is no cause of surprise</p>
<p>that in the measures taken against him he recognized the direct</p>
<p>agency of Satan to stop the course of the truth:  &quot;That old enemy</p>
<p>of man&#x27;s salvation,&quot; he says, &quot;took his opportunity to inflame the</p>
<p>hearts of his vassals against me, insomuch that at the last I was</p>
<p>laid out for the warrant of a justice.&quot;  The circumstances were</p>
<p>these, on November 12, 1660, Bunyan had engaged to go to the little</p>
<p>hamlet of Lower Samsell near Harlington, to hold a religious</p>
<p>service.  His purpose becoming known, a neighbouring magistrate,</p>
<p>Mr. Francis Wingate, of Harlington House, was instructed to issue a</p>
<p>warrant for his apprehension under the Act of Elizabeth.  The</p>
<p>meeting being represented to him as one of seditious persons</p>
<p>bringing arms, with a view to the disturbance of the public peace,</p>
<p>he ordered that a strong watch should be kept about the house, &quot;as</p>
<p>if,&quot; Bunyan says, &quot;we did intend to do some fearful business to the</p>
<p>destruction of the country.&quot;  The intention to arrest him oozed</p>
<p>out, and on Bunyan&#x27;s arrival the whisperings of his friends warned</p>
<p>him of his danger.  He might have easily escaped if he &quot;had been</p>
<p>minded to play the coward.&quot;  Some advised it, especially the</p>
<p>brother at whose house the meeting was to take place.  He, &quot;living</p>
<p>by them,&quot; knew &quot;what spirit&quot; the magistrates &quot;were of,&quot; before whom</p>
<p>Bunyan would be taken if arrested, and the small hope there would</p>
<p>be of his avoiding being committed to gaol.  The man himself, as a</p>
<p>&quot;harbourer of a conventicle,&quot; would also run no small danger of the</p>
<p>same fate, but Bunyan generously acquits him of any selfish object</p>
<p>in his warning:  &quot;he was, I think, more afraid of (for) me, than of</p>
<p>(for) himself.&quot;  The matter was clear enough to Bunyan.  At the</p>
<p>same time it was not to be decided in a hurry.  The time fixed for</p>
<p>the service not being yet come, Bunyan went into the meadow by the</p>
<p>house, and pacing up and down thought the question well out.  &quot;If</p>
<p>he who had up to this time showed himself hearty and courageous in</p>
<p>his preaching, and had made it his business to encourage others,</p>
<p>were now to run and make an escape, it would be of an ill savour in</p>
<p>the country.  If he were now to flee because there was a warrant</p>
<p>out for him, would not the weak and newly-converted brethren be</p>
<p>afraid to stand when great words only were spoken to them.  God</p>
<p>had, in His mercy, chosen him to go on the forlorn hope; to be the</p>
<p>first to be opposed for the gospel; what a discouragement it must</p>
<p>be to the whole body if he were to fly.  No, he would never by any</p>
<p>cowardliness of his give occasion to the enemy to blaspheme the</p>
<p>gospel.&quot;  So back to the house he came with his mind made up.  He</p>
<p>had come to hold the meeting, and hold the meeting he would.  He</p>
<p>was not conscious of saying or doing any evil.  If he had to suffer</p>
<p>it was the Lord&#x27;s will, and he was prepared for it.  He had a full</p>
<p>hour before him to escape if he had been so minded, but he was</p>
<p>resolved &quot;not to go away.&quot;  He calmly waited for the time fixed for</p>
<p>the brethren to assemble, and then, without hurry or any show of</p>
<p>alarm, he opened the meeting in the usual manner, with prayer for</p>
<p>God&#x27;s blessing.  He had given out his text, the brethren had just</p>
<p>opened their Bibles and Bunyan was beginning to preach, when the</p>
<p>arrival of the constable with the warrant put an end to the</p>
<p>exercise.  Bunyan requested to be allowed to say a few parting</p>
<p>words of encouragement to the terrified flock.  This was granted,</p>
<p>and he comforted the little company with the reflection that it was</p>
<p>a mercy to suffer in so good a cause; and that it was better to be</p>
<p>the persecuted than the persecutors; better to suffer as Christians</p>
<p>than as thieves or murderers.  The constable and the justice&#x27;s</p>
<p>servant soon growing weary of listening to Bunyan&#x27;s exhortations,</p>
<p>interrupted him and &quot;would not be quiet till they had him away&quot;</p>
<p>from the house.</p>
<p>The justice who had issued the warrant, Mr. Wingate, not being at</p>
<p>home that day, a friend of Bunyan&#x27;s residing on the spot offered to</p>
<p>house him for the night, undertaking that he should be forthcoming</p>
<p>the next day.  The following morning this friend took him to the</p>
<p>constable&#x27;s house, and they then proceeded together to Mr.</p>
<p>Wingate&#x27;s.  A few inquiries showed the magistrate that he had</p>
<p>entirely mistaken the character of the Samsell meeting and its</p>
<p>object.  Instead of a gathering of &quot;Fifth Monarchy men,&quot; or other</p>
<p>turbulent fanatics as he had supposed, for the disturbance of the</p>
<p>public peace, he learnt from the constable that they were only a</p>
<p>few peaceable, harmless people, met together &quot;to preach and hear</p>
<p>the word,&quot; without any political meaning.  Wingate was now at a</p>
<p>nonplus, and &quot;could not well tell what to say.&quot;  For the credit of</p>
<p>his magisterial character, however, he must do something to show</p>
<p>that he had not made a mistake in issuing the warrant.  So he asked</p>
<p>Bunyan what business he had there, and why it was not enough for</p>
<p>him to follow his own calling instead of breaking the law by</p>
<p>preaching.  Bunyan replied that his only object in coming there was</p>
<p>to exhort his hearers for their souls&#x27; sake to forsake their sinful</p>
<p>courses and close in with Christ, and this he could do and follow</p>
<p>his calling as well.  Wingate, now feeling himself in the wrong,</p>
<p>lost his temper, and declared angrily that he would &quot;break the neck</p>
<p>of these unlawful meetings,&quot; and that Bunyan must find securities</p>
<p>for his good behaviour or go to gaol.  There was no difficulty in</p>
<p>obtaining the security.  Bail was at once forthcoming.  The real</p>
<p>difficulty lay with Bunyan himself.  No bond was strong enough to</p>
<p>keep him from preaching.  If his friends gave them, their bonds</p>
<p>would be forfeited, for he &quot;would not leave speaking the word of</p>
<p>God.&quot;  Wingate told him that this being so, he must be sent to gaol</p>
<p>to be tried at the next Quarter Sessions, and left the room to make</p>
<p>out his mittimus.  While the committal was preparing, one whom</p>
<p>Bunyan bitterly styles &quot;an old enemy to the truth,&quot; Dr. Lindall,</p>
<p>Vicar of Harlington, Wingate&#x27;s father-in-law, came in and began</p>
<p>&quot;taunting at him with many reviling terms,&quot; demanding what right he</p>
<p>had to preach and meddle with that for which he had no warrant,</p>
<p>charging him with making long prayers to devour widows houses, and</p>
<p>likening him to &quot;one Alexander the Coppersmith he had read of,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;aiming, &#x27;tis like,&quot; says Bunyan, &quot;at me because I was a tinker.&quot;</p>
<p>The mittimus was now made out, and Bunyan in the constable&#x27;s charge</p>
<p>was on his way to Bedford, when he was met by two of his friends,</p>
<p>who begged the constable to wait a little while that they might use</p>
<p>their interest with the magistrate to get Bunyan released.  After a</p>
<p>somewhat lengthened interview with Wingate, they returned with the</p>
<p>message that if Bunyan would wait on the magistrate and &quot;say</p>
<p>certain words&quot; to him, he might go free.  To satisfy his friends,</p>
<p>Bunyan returned with them, though not with any expectation that the</p>
<p>engagement proposed to him would be such as he could lawfully take.</p>
<p>&quot;If the words were such as he could say with a good conscience he</p>
<p>would say them, or else he would not.&quot;</p>
<p>After all this coming and going, by the time Bunyan and his friends</p>
<p>got back to Harlington House, night had come on.  As he entered the</p>
<p>hall, one, he tells us, came out of an inner room with a lighted</p>
<p>candle in his hand, whom Bunyan recognized as one William Foster, a</p>
<p>lawyer of Bedford, Wingate&#x27;s brother-in-law, afterwards a fierce</p>
<p>persecutor of the Nonconformists of the district.  With a simulated</p>
<p>affection, &quot;as if he would have leapt on my neck and kissed me,&quot;</p>
<p>which put Bunyan on his guard, as he had ever known him for &quot;a</p>
<p>close opposer of the ways of God,&quot; he adopted the tone of one who</p>
<p>had Bunyan&#x27;s interest at heart, and begged him as a friend to yield</p>
<p>a little from his stubbornness.  His brother-in-law, he said, was</p>
<p>very loath to send him to gaol.  All he had to do was only to</p>
<p>promise that he would not call people together, and he should be</p>
<p>set at liberty and might go back to his home.  Such meetings were</p>
<p>plainly unlawful and must be stopped.  Bunyan had better follow his</p>
<p>calling and leave off preaching, especially on week-days, which</p>
<p>made other people neglect their calling too.  God commanded men to</p>
<p>work six days and serve Him on the seventh.  It was vain for Bunyan</p>
<p>to reply that he never summoned people to hear him, but that if</p>
<p>they came he could not but use the best of his skill and wisdom to</p>
<p>counsel them for their soul&#x27;s salvation; that he could preach and</p>
<p>the people could come to hear without neglecting their callings,</p>
<p>and that men were bound to look out for their souls&#x27; welfare on</p>
<p>week-days as well as Sundays.  Neither could convince the other.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s stubbornness was not a little provoking to Foster, and was</p>
<p>equally disappointing to Wingate.  They both evidently wished to</p>
<p>dismiss the case, and intentionally provided a loophole for</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s escape.  The promise put into his mouth - &quot;that he would</p>
<p>not call the people together&quot; - was purposely devised to meet his</p>
<p>scrupulous conscience.  But even if he could keep the promise in</p>
<p>the letter, Bunyan knew that he was fully purposed to violate its</p>
<p>spirit.  He was the last man to forfeit self-respect by playing</p>
<p>fast and loose with his conscience.  All evasion was foreign to his</p>
<p>nature.  The long interview came to an end at last.  Once again</p>
<p>Wingate and Foster endeavoured to break down Bunyan&#x27;s resolution;</p>
<p>but when they saw he was &quot;at a point, and would not be moved or</p>
<p>persuaded,&quot; the mittimus was again put into the constable&#x27;s hands,</p>
<p>and he and his prisoner were started on the walk to Bedford gaol.</p>
<p>It was dark, as we have seen, when this protracted interview began.</p>
<p>It must have now been deep in the night.  Bunyan gives no hint</p>
<p>whether the walk was taken in the dark or in the daylight.  There</p>
<p>was however no need for haste.  Bedford was thirteen miles away,</p>
<p>and the constable would probably wait till the morning to set out</p>
<p>for the prison which was to be Bunyan&#x27;s home for twelve long years,</p>
<p>to which he went carrying, he says, the &quot;peace of God along with</p>
<p>me, and His comfort in my poor soul.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>A long-standing tradition has identified Bunyan&#x27;s place of</p>
<p>imprisonment with a little corporation lock-up-house, some fourteen</p>
<p>feet square, picturesquely perched on one of the mid-piers of the</p>
<p>many-arched mediaeval bridge which, previously to 1765, spanned the</p>
<p>Ouse at Bedford, and as Mr. Froude has said, has &quot;furnished a</p>
<p>subject for pictures,&quot; both of pen and pencil, &quot;which if correct</p>
<p>would be extremely affecting.&quot;  Unfortunately, however, for the</p>
<p>lovers of the sensational, these pictures are not &quot;correct,&quot; but</p>
<p>are based on a false assumption which grew up out of a desire to</p>
<p>heap contumely on Bunyan&#x27;s enemies by exaggerating the severity of</p>
<p>his protracted, but by no means harsh imprisonment.  Being arrested</p>
<p>by the warrant of a county magistrate for a county offence,</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s place of incarceration was naturally the county gaol.</p>
<p>There he undoubtedly passed the twelve years of his captivity, and</p>
<p>there the royal warrant for his release found him &quot;a prisoner in</p>
<p>the common gaol for our county of Bedford.&quot;  But though far</p>
<p>different from the pictures which writers, desirous of exhibiting</p>
<p>the sufferings of the Puritan confessor in the most telling form,</p>
<p>have drawn - if not &quot;a damp and dreary cell&quot; into which &quot;a narrow</p>
<p>chink admits a few scanty rays of light to render visible the</p>
<p>prisoner, pale and emaciated, seated on the humid earth, pursuing</p>
<p>his daily task to earn the morsel which prolongs his existence and</p>
<p>his confinement together,&quot; - &quot;the common gaol&quot; of Bedford must have</p>
<p>been a sufficiently strait and unwholesome abode, especially for</p>
<p>one, like the travelling tinker, accustomed to spend the greater</p>
<p>part of his days in the open-air in unrestricted freedom.  Prisons</p>
<p>in those days, and indeed long afterwards, were, at their best,</p>
<p>foul, dark, miserable places.  A century later Howard found Bedford</p>
<p>gaol, though better than some, in what would now be justly deemed a</p>
<p>disgraceful condition.  One who visited Bunyan during his</p>
<p>confinement speaks of it as &quot;an uncomfortable and close prison.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan however himself, in the narrative of his imprisonment, makes</p>
<p>no complaint of it, nor do we hear of his health having in any way</p>
<p>suffered from the conditions of his confinement, as was the case</p>
<p>with not a few of his fellow-sufferers for the sake of religion in</p>
<p>other English gaols, some of them even unto death.  Bad as it must</p>
<p>have been to be a prisoner, as far as his own testimony goes, there</p>
<p>is no evidence that his imprisonment, though varying in its</p>
<p>strictness with his various gaolers, was aggravated by any special</p>
<p>severity; and, as Mr. Froude has said, &quot;it is unlikely that at any</p>
<p>time he was made to suffer any greater hardships than were</p>
<p>absolutely inevitable.&quot;</p>
<p>The arrest of one whose work as a preacher had been a blessing to</p>
<p>so many, was not at once tamely acquiesced in by the religious body</p>
<p>to which he belonged.  A few days after Bunyan&#x27;s committal to gaol,</p>
<p>some of &quot;the brethren&quot; applied to Mr. Crompton, a young magistrate</p>
<p>at Elstow, to bail him out, offering the required security for his</p>
<p>appearance at the Quarter Sessions.  The magistrate was at first</p>
<p>disposed to accept the bail; but being a young man, new in his</p>
<p>office, and thinking it possible that there might be more against</p>
<p>Bunyan than the &quot;mittimus&quot; expressed, he was afraid of compromising</p>
<p>himself by letting him go at large.  His refusal, though it sent</p>
<p>him back to prison, was received by Bunyan with his usual calm</p>
<p>trust in God&#x27;s overruling providence.  &quot;I was not at all daunted,</p>
<p>but rather glad, and saw evidently that the Lord had heard me.&quot;</p>
<p>Before he set out for the justice&#x27;s house, he tells us he had</p>
<p>committed the whole event to God&#x27;s ordering, with the prayer that</p>
<p>&quot;if he might do more good by being at liberty than in prison,&quot; the</p>
<p>bail might be accepted, &quot;but if not, that His will might be done.&quot;</p>
<p>In the failure of his friends&#x27; good offices he saw an answer to his</p>
<p>prayer, encouraging the hope that the untoward event, which</p>
<p>deprived them of his personal ministrations, &quot;might be an awaking</p>
<p>to the saints in the country,&quot; and while &quot;the slender answer of the</p>
<p>justice,&quot; which sent him back to his prison, stirred something akin</p>
<p>to contempt, his soul was full of gladness.  &quot;Verily I did meet my</p>
<p>God sweetly again, comforting of me, and satisfying of me, that it</p>
<p>was His will and mind that I should be there.&quot;  The sense that he</p>
<p>was being conformed to the image of his great Master was a stay to</p>
<p>his soul.  &quot;This word,&quot; he continues, &quot;did drop in upon my heart</p>
<p>with some life, for he knew that &#x27;for envy they had delivered</p>
<p>him.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Seven weeds after his committal, early in January, 1661, the</p>
<p>Quarter Sessions came on, and &quot;John Bunyan, of the town of Bedford,</p>
<p>labourer,&quot; was indicted in the customary form for having</p>
<p>&quot;devilishly and perniciously abstained from coming to church to</p>
<p>hear Divine Service,&quot; and as &quot;a common upholder of several unlawful</p>
<p>meetings and conventions, to the great disturbance and distraction</p>
<p>of the good subjects of the kingdom.&quot;  The chairman of the bench</p>
<p>was the brutal and blustering Sir John Keeling, the prototype of</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s Lord Hategood in Faithful&#x27;s trial at Vanity Fair, who</p>
<p>afterwards, by his base subserviency to an infamous government,</p>
<p>climbed to the Lord Chief Justice&#x27;s seat, over the head of Sir</p>
<p>Matthew Hale.  Keeling had suffered much from the Puritans during</p>
<p>the great Rebellion, when, according to Clarendon, he was &quot;always</p>
<p>in gaol,&quot; and was by no means disposed to deal leniently with an</p>
<p>offender of that persuasion.  His brethren of the bench were</p>
<p>country gentlemen hating Puritanism from their heart, and eager for</p>
<p>retaliation for the wrongs it had wrought them.  From such a bench,</p>
<p>even if Bunyan had been less uncompromising, no leniency was to be</p>
<p>anticipated.  But Bunyan&#x27;s attitude forbade any leniency.  As the</p>
<p>law stood he had indisputably broken it, and he expressed his</p>
<p>determination, respectfully but firmly, to take the first</p>
<p>opportunity of breaking it again.  &quot;I told them that if I was let</p>
<p>out of prison today I would preach the gospel again to-morrow by</p>
<p>the help of God.&quot;  We may dislike the tone adopted by the</p>
<p>magistrates towards the prisoner; we may condemn it as overbearing</p>
<p>and contemptuous; we may smile at Keeling&#x27;s expositions of</p>
<p>Scripture and his stock arguments against unauthorized prayer and</p>
<p>preaching, though we may charitably believe that Bunyan</p>
<p>misunderstood him when he makes him say that &quot;the Book of Common</p>
<p>Prayer had been ever since the apostles&#x27; time&quot;; we may think that</p>
<p>the prisoner, in his &quot;canting pedlar&#x27;s French,&quot; as Keeling called</p>
<p>it, had the better of his judges in knowledge of the Bible, in</p>
<p>Christian charity, as well as in dignity and in common sense, and</p>
<p>that they showed their wisdom in silencing him in court - &quot;Let him</p>
<p>speak no further,&quot; said one of them, &quot;he will do harm,&quot; - since</p>
<p>they could not answer him more convincingly:  but his legal offence</p>
<p>was clear.  He confessed to the indictment, if not in express</p>
<p>terms, yet virtually.  He and his friends had held &quot;many meetings</p>
<p>together, both to pray to God and to exhort one another.  I</p>
<p>confessed myself guilty no otherwise.&quot;  Such meetings were</p>
<p>forbidden by the law, which it was the duty of the justices to</p>
<p>administer, and they had no choice whether they would convict or</p>
<p>no.  Perhaps they were not sorry they had no such choice.  Bunyan</p>
<p>was a most &quot;impracticable&quot; prisoner, and as Mr. Froude says, the</p>
<p>&quot;magistrates being but unregenerate mortals may be pardoned if they</p>
<p>found him provoking.&quot;  The sentence necessarily followed.  It was</p>
<p>pronounced, not, we are sure reluctantly, by Keeling, in the terms</p>
<p>of the Act.  &quot;He was to go back to prison for three months.  If at</p>
<p>three months&#x27; end he still refused to go to church to hear Divine</p>
<p>service and leave his preaching, he was to be banished the realm,&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>in modern language &quot;transported,&quot; and if &quot;he came back again</li>
</ul>
<p>without special royal license,&quot; he must &quot;stretch by the neck for</p>
<p>it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This,&quot; said Keeling, &quot;I tell you plainly.&quot;  Bunyan&#x27;s reply that</p>
<p>&quot;as to that matter he was at a point with the judge,&quot; for &quot;that he</p>
<p>would repeat the offence the first time he could,&quot; provoked a</p>
<p>rejoinder from one of the bench, and the unseemly wrangling might</p>
<p>have been still further prolonged, had it not been stopped by the</p>
<p>gaoler, who &quot;pulling him away to be gone,&quot; had him back to prison,</p>
<p>where he says, and &quot;blesses the Lord Jesus Christ for it,&quot; his</p>
<p>heart was as &quot;sweetly refreshed&quot; in returning to it as it had &quot;been</p>
<p>during his examination.  So that I find Christ&#x27;s words more than</p>
<p>bare trifles, where He saith, He will give a mouth and wisdom, even</p>
<p>such as all the adversaries shall not gainsay or resist.  And that</p>
<p>His peace no man can take from us.&quot;</p>
<p>The magistrates, however, though not unnaturally irritated by what</p>
<p>seemed to them Bunyan&#x27;s unreasonable obstinacy, were not desirous</p>
<p>to push matters to extremity.  The three months named in his</p>
<p>sentence, at the expiration of which he was either to conform or be</p>
<p>banished the realm, were fast drawing to an end, without any sign</p>
<p>of submission on his part.  As a last resort Mr. Cobb, the Clerk of</p>
<p>the Peace, was sent to try what calm and friendly reasoning might</p>
<p>effect.  Cobb, who evidently knew Bunyan personally, did his best,</p>
<p>as a kind-hearted, sensible man, to bring him to reason.  Cobb did</p>
<p>not profess to be &quot;a man that could dispute,&quot; and Bunyan had the</p>
<p>better of him in argument.  His position, however, was</p>
<p>unassailable.  The recent insurrection of Venner and his Fifth</p>
<p>Monarchy men, he said, had shown the danger to the public peace</p>
<p>there was in allowing fanatical gatherings to assemble unchecked.</p>
<p>Bunyan, whose loyalty was unquestioned, must acknowledge the</p>
<p>prudence of suppressing meetings which, however good their</p>
<p>ostensible aim, might issue in nothing less than the ruin of the</p>
<p>kingdom and commonwealth.  Bunyan had confessed his readiness to</p>
<p>obey the apostolic precept by submitting himself to the king as</p>
<p>supreme.  The king forbade the holding of private meetings, which,</p>
<p>under colour of religion, might be prejudicial to the State.  Why</p>
<p>then did he not submit?  This need not hinder him from doing good</p>
<p>in a neighbourly way.  He might continue to use his gifts and</p>
<p>exhort his neighbours in private discourse, provided he did not</p>
<p>bring people together in public assemblies.  The law did not</p>
<p>abridge him of this liberty.  Why should he stand so strictly on</p>
<p>public meetings?  Or why should he not come to church and hear?</p>
<p>Was his gift so far above that of others that he could learn of no</p>
<p>one?  If he could not be persuaded, the judges were resolved to</p>
<p>prosecute the law against him.  He would be sent away beyond the</p>
<p>seas to Spain or Constantinople - either Cobb&#x27;s or Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>colonial geography was rather at fault here - or some other remote</p>
<p>part of the world, and what good could he do to his friends then?</p>
<p>&quot;Neighbour Bunyan&quot; had better consider these things seriously</p>
<p>before the Quarter Session, and be ruled by good advice.  The</p>
<p>gaoler here put in his word in support of Cobb&#x27;s arguments:</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, sir, I hope he will be ruled.&quot;  But all Cobb&#x27;s friendly</p>
<p>reasonings and expostulations were ineffectual to bend Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>sturdy will.  He would yield to no-one in his loyalty to his</p>
<p>sovereign, and his readiness to obey the law.  But, he said, with a</p>
<p>hairsplitting casuistry he would have indignantly condemned in</p>
<p>others, the law provided two ways of obeying, &quot;one to obey</p>
<p>actively, and if his conscience forbad that, then to obey</p>
<p>passively; to lie down and suffer whatever they might do to him.&quot;</p>
<p>The Clerk of the Peace saw that it was no use to prolong the</p>
<p>argument any further.  &quot;At this,&quot; writes Bunyan, &quot;he sat down, and</p>
<p>said no more; which, when he had done, I did thank him for his</p>
<p>civil and meek discoursing with me; and so we parted:  O that we</p>
<p>might meet in heaven!&quot;</p>
<p>The Coronation which took place very soon after this interview,</p>
<p>April 13, 1661, afforded a prospect of release without unworthy</p>
<p>submission.  The customary proclamation, which allowed prisoners</p>
<p>under sentence for any offence short of felony to sue out a pardon</p>
<p>for twelve months from that date, suspended the execution of the</p>
<p>sentence of banishment and gave a hope that the prison doors might</p>
<p>be opened for him.  The local authorities taking no steps to enable</p>
<p>him to profit by the royal clemency, by inserting his name in the</p>
<p>list of pardonable offenders, his second wife, Elizabeth, travelled</p>
<p>up to London, - no slight venture for a young woman not so long</p>
<p>raised from the sick bed on which the first news of her husband&#x27;s</p>
<p>arrest had laid her, - and with dauntless courage made her way to</p>
<p>the House of Lords, where she presented her petition to one of the</p>
<p>peers, whom she calls Lord Barkwood, but whom unfortunately we</p>
<p>cannot now identify.  He treated her kindly, and showed her</p>
<p>petition to other peers, who appear to have been acquainted with</p>
<p>the circumstances of Bunyan&#x27;s case.  They replied that the matter</p>
<p>was beyond their province, and that the question of her husband&#x27;s</p>
<p>release was committed to the judges at the next assizes.  These</p>
<p>assizes were held at Bedford in the following August.  The judges</p>
<p>of the circuit were Twisden and Sir Matthew Hale.  From the latter</p>
<ul>
<li>the friend of Richard Baxter, who, as Burnet records, took great</li>
</ul>
<p>care to &quot;cover the Nonconformists, whom he thought too hardly used,</p>
<p>all he could from the seventies some designed; and discouraged</p>
<p>those who were inclined to stretch the laws too much against them&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Bunyan&#x27;s case would be certain to meet with sympathetic</li>
</ul>
<p>consideration.  But being set to administer the law, not according</p>
<p>to his private wishes, but according to its letter and its spirit,</p>
<p>he was powerless to relieve him.  Three several times did Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>noble-hearted wife present her husband&#x27;s petition that he might be</p>
<p>heard, and his case taken impartially into consideration.  But the</p>
<p>law forbad what Burnet calls Sir Matthew Hale&#x27;s &quot;tender and</p>
<p>compassionate nature&quot; to have free exercise.  He &quot;received the</p>
<p>petition very mildly at her hand, telling her that he would do her</p>
<p>and her husband the best good he could; but he feared he could do</p>
<p>none.&quot;  His brother judge&#x27;s reception of her petition was very</p>
<p>different.  Having thrown it into the coach, Twisden &quot;snapt her</p>
<p>up,&quot; telling her, what after all was no more than the truth, that</p>
<p>her husband was a convicted person, and could not be released</p>
<p>unless he would promise to obey the law and abstain from preaching.</p>
<p>On this the High Sheriff, Edmund Wylde, of Houghton Conquest, spoke</p>
<p>kindly to the poor woman, and encouraged her to make a fresh</p>
<p>application to the judges before they left the town.  So she made</p>
<p>her way, &quot;with abashed face and trembling heart,&quot; to the large</p>
<p>chamber at the Old Swan Inn at the Bridge Foot, where the two</p>
<p>judges were receiving a large number of the justices of the peace</p>
<p>and other gentry of the county.  Addressing Sir Matthew Hale she</p>
<p>said, &quot;My lord, I make bold to come again to your lordship to know</p>
<p>what may be done with my husband.&quot;  Hale received her with the same</p>
<p>gentleness as before, repeated what he had said previously, that as</p>
<p>her husband had been legally convicted, and his conviction was</p>
<p>recorded, unless there was something to undo that he could do her</p>
<p>no good.  Twisden, on the other hand, got violently angry, charged</p>
<p>her brutally with making poverty her cloak, told her that her</p>
<p>husband was a breaker of the peace, whose doctrine was the doctrine</p>
<p>of the devil, and that he ran up and down and did harm, while he</p>
<p>was better maintained by his preaching than by following his</p>
<p>tinker&#x27;s craft.  At last he waxed so violent that &quot;withal she</p>
<p>thought he would have struck her.&quot;  In the midst of all his coarse</p>
<p>abuse, however, Twisden hit the mark when he asked:  &quot;What! you</p>
<p>think we can do what we list?&quot;  And when we find Hale, confessedly</p>
<p>the soundest lawyer of the time, whose sympathies were all with the</p>
<p>prisoner, after calling for the Statute Book, thus summing up the</p>
<p>matter:  &quot;I am sorry, woman, that I can do thee no good.  Thou must</p>
<p>do one of these three things, viz., either apply thyself to the</p>
<p>king, or sue out his pardon, or get a writ of error,&quot; which last,</p>
<p>he told her, would be the cheapest course - we may feel sure that</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s Petition was not granted because it could not be granted</p>
<p>legally.  The blame of his continued imprisonment lay, if anywhere,</p>
<p>with the law, not with its administrators.  This is not always</p>
<p>borne in mind as it ought to be.  As Mr. Froude remarks, &quot;Persons</p>
<p>often choose to forget that judges are sworn to administer the law</p>
<p>which they find, and rail at them as if the sentences which they</p>
<p>are obliged by their oath to pass were their own personal acts.&quot;</p>
<p>It is not surprising that Elizabeth Bunyan was unable to draw this</p>
<p>distinction, and that she left the Swan chamber in tears, not,</p>
<p>however, so much at what she thought the judges&#x27; &quot;hardheartedness</p>
<p>to her and her husband,&quot; as at the thought of &quot;the sad account such</p>
<p>poor creatures would have to give&quot; hereafter, for what she deemed</p>
<p>their &quot;opposition to Christ and His gospel.&quot;</p>
<p>No steps seem to have been taken by Bunyan&#x27;s wife, or any of his</p>
<p>influential friends, to carry out either of the expedients named by</p>
<p>Hale.  It may have been that the money needed was not forthcoming,</p>
<p>or, what Southey remarks is &quot;quite probable,&quot; - &quot;because it is</p>
<p>certain that Bunyan, thinking himself in conscience bound to preach</p>
<p>in defiance of the law, would soon have made his case worse than it</p>
<p>then was.&quot;</p>
<p>At the next assizes, which were held in January, 1662, Bunyan again</p>
<p>made strenuous efforts to get his name put on the calendar of</p>
<p>felons, that he might have a regular trial before the king&#x27;s judges</p>
<p>and be able to plead his cause in person.  This, however, was</p>
<p>effectually thwarted by the unfriendly influence of the county</p>
<p>magistrates by whom he had been committed, and the Clerk of the</p>
<p>Peace, Mr. Cobb, who having failed in his kindly meant attempt to</p>
<p>induce &quot;Neighbour Bunyan&quot; to conform, had turned bitterly against</p>
<p>him and become one of his chief enemies.  &quot;Thus,&quot; writes Bunyan,</p>
<p>&quot;was I hindered and prevented at that time also from appearing</p>
<p>before the judge, and left in prison.&quot;  Of this prison, the county</p>
<p>gaol of Bedford, he remained an inmate, with one, short interval in</p>
<p>1666, for the next twelve years, till his release by order of the</p>
<p>Privy Council, May 17, 1672.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<p>The exaggeration of the severity of Bunyan&#x27;s imprisonment long</p>
<p>current, now that the facts are better known, has led, by a very</p>
<p>intelligible reaction, to an undue depreciation of it.  Mr. Froude</p>
<p>thinks that his incarceration was &quot;intended to be little more than</p>
<p>nominal,&quot; and was really meant in kindness by the authorities who</p>
<p>&quot;respected his character,&quot; as the best means of preventing him from</p>
<p>getting himself into greater trouble by &quot;repeating an offence that</p>
<p>would compel them to adopt harsh measures which they were earnestly</p>
<p>trying to avoid.&quot;  If convicted again he must be transported, and</p>
<p>&quot;they were unwilling to drive him out of the country.&quot;  It is,</p>
<p>however, to be feared that it was no such kind consideration for</p>
<p>the tinker-preacher which kept the prison doors closed on Bunyan.</p>
<p>To the justices he was simply an obstinate law-breaker, who must be</p>
<p>kept in prison as long as he refused compliance with the Act.  If</p>
<p>he rotted in gaol, as so many of his fellow sufferers for</p>
<p>conscience&#x27; sake did in those unhappy times, it was no concern of</p>
<p>theirs.  He and his stubbornness would be alone to blame.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that during a portion of his captivity,</p>
<p>Bunyan, in Dr. Brown&#x27;s words, &quot;had an amount of liberty which in</p>
<p>the case of a prisoner nowadays would be simply impossible.&quot;  But</p>
<p>the mistake has been made of extending to the whole period an</p>
<p>indulgence which belonged only to a part, and that a very limited</p>
<p>part of it.  When we are told that Bunyan was treated as a prisoner</p>
<p>at large, and like one &quot;on parole,&quot; free to come and go as he</p>
<p>pleased, even as far as London, we must remember that Bunyan&#x27;s own</p>
<p>words expressly restrict this indulgence to the six months between</p>
<p>the Autumn Assizes of 1661 and the Spring Assizes of 1662.</p>
<p>&quot;Between these two assizes,&quot; he says, &quot;I had by my jailer some</p>
<p>liberty granted me more than at the first.&quot;  This liberty was</p>
<p>certainly of the largest kind consistent with his character of a</p>
<p>prisoner.  The church books show that he was occasionally present</p>
<p>at their meetings, and was employed on the business of the</p>
<p>congregation.  Nay, even his preaching, which was the cause of his</p>
<p>imprisonment, was not forbidden.  &quot;I followed,&quot; he says, writing of</p>
<p>this period, &quot;my wonted course of preaching, taking all occasions</p>
<p>that were put into my hand to visit the people of God.&quot;  But this</p>
<p>indulgence was very brief and was brought sharply to an end.  It</p>
<p>was plainly irregular, and depended on the connivance of his</p>
<p>jailer.  We cannot be surprised that when it came to the</p>
<p>magistrates&#x27; ears - &quot;my enemies,&quot; Bunyan rather unworthily calls</p>
<p>them - they were seriously displeased.  Confounding Bunyan with the</p>
<p>Fifth Monarchy men and other turbulent sectaries, they imagined</p>
<p>that his visits to London had a political object, &quot;to plot, and</p>
<p>raise division, and make insurrections,&quot; which, he honestly adds,</p>
<p>&quot;God knows was a slander.&quot;  The jailer was all but &quot;cast out of his</p>
<p>place,&quot; and threatened with an indictment for breach of trust,</p>
<p>while his own liberty was so seriously &quot;straitened&quot; that he was</p>
<p>prohibited even &quot;to look out at the door.&quot;  The last time Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>name appears as present at a church meeting is October 28, 1661,</p>
<p>nor do we see it again till October 9, 1668, only four years before</p>
<p>his twelve years term of imprisonment expired.</p>
<p>But though his imprisonment was not so severe, nor his prison quite</p>
<p>so narrow and wretched as some word-painters have described them,</p>
<p>during the greater part of the time his condition was a dreary and</p>
<p>painful one, especially when spent, as it sometimes was, &quot;under</p>
<p>cruel and oppressive jailers.&quot;  The enforced separation from his</p>
<p>wife and children, especially his tenderly loved blind daughter,</p>
<p>Mary, was a continually renewed anguish to his loving heart.  &quot;The</p>
<p>parting with them,&quot; he writes, &quot;hath often been to me as pulling</p>
<p>the flesh from the bones; and that not only because I am somewhat</p>
<p>too fond of these great mercies, but also because I should often</p>
<p>have brought to my mind the many hardships, miseries, and wants my</p>
<p>poor family was like to meet with, should I be taken from them;</p>
<p>especially my poor blind child, who lay nearer to my heart than all</p>
<p>beside.  Poor child, thought I, thou must be beaten, thou must beg,</p>
<p>thou must suffer hunger, cold, nakedness, and a thousand</p>
<p>calamities, though I cannot now endure the wind should blow on</p>
<p>thee.  O, the thoughts of the hardships my blind one might go under</p>
<p>would break my heart to pieces.&quot;  He seemed to himself like a man</p>
<p>pulling down his house on his wife and children&#x27;s head, and yet he</p>
<p>felt, &quot;I must do it; O, I must do it.&quot;  He was also, he tells us,</p>
<p>at one time, being but &quot;a young prisoner,&quot; greatly troubled by the</p>
<p>thoughts that &quot;for aught he could tell,&quot; his &quot;imprisonment might</p>
<p>end at the gallows,&quot; not so much that he dreaded death as that he</p>
<p>was apprehensive that when it came to the point, even if he made &quot;a</p>
<p>scrabbling shift to clamber up the ladder,&quot; he might play the</p>
<p>coward and so do discredit to the cause of religion.  &quot;I was</p>
<p>ashamed to die with a pale face and tottering knees for such a</p>
<p>cause as this.&quot;  The belief that his imprisonment might be</p>
<p>terminated by death on the scaffold, however groundless, evidently</p>
<p>weighed long on his mind.  The closing sentences of his third</p>
<p>prison book, &quot;Christian Behaviour,&quot; published in 1663, the second</p>
<p>year of his durance, clearly point to such an expectation.  &quot;Thus</p>
<p>have I in few words written to you before I die, . . . not knowing</p>
<p>the shortness of my life, nor the hindrances that hereafter I may</p>
<p>have of serving my God and you.&quot;  The ladder of his apprehensions</p>
<p>was, as Mr. Froude has said, &quot;an imaginary ladder,&quot; but it was very</p>
<p>real to Bunyan.  &quot;Oft I was as if I was on the ladder with a rope</p>
<p>about my neck.&quot;  The thought of it, as his autobiography shows,</p>
<p>caused him some of his deepest searchings of heart, and noblest</p>
<p>ventures of faith.  He was content to suffer by the hangman&#x27;s hand</p>
<p>if thus he might have an opportunity of addressing the crowd that</p>
<p>he thought would come to see him die.  &quot;And if it must be so, if</p>
<p>God will but convert one soul by my very last words, I shall not</p>
<p>count my life thrown away or lost.&quot;  And even when hours of</p>
<p>darkness came over his soul, and he was tempted to question the</p>
<p>reality of his Christian profession, and to doubt whether God would</p>
<p>give him comfort at the hour of death, he stayed himself up with</p>
<p>such bold words as these.  &quot;I was bound, but He was free.  Yea,</p>
<p>&#x27;twas my duty to stand to His word whether He would ever look on me</p>
<p>or no, or save me at the last.  If God doth not come in, thought I,</p>
<p>I will leap off the ladder even blindfold into Eternity, sink or</p>
<p>swim, come heaven, come hell.  Lord Jesus, if Thou wilt catch me,</p>
<p>do.  If not, I will venture for Thy name.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan being precluded by his imprisonment from carrying on his</p>
<p>brazier&#x27;s craft for the support of his wife and family, and his</p>
<p>active spirit craving occupation, he got himself taught how to make</p>
<p>&quot;long tagged laces,&quot; &quot;many hundred gross&quot; of which, we are told by</p>
<p>one who first formed his acquaintance in prison, he made during his</p>
<p>captivity, for &quot;his own and his family&#x27;s necessities.&quot;  &quot;While his</p>
<p>hands were thus busied,&quot; writes Lord Macaulay, &quot;he had often</p>
<p>employment for his mind and for his lips.&quot;  &quot;Though a prisoner he</p>
<p>was a preacher still.&quot;  As with St. Paul in his Roman chains, &quot;the</p>
<p>word of God was not bound.&quot;  The prisoners for conscience&#x27; sake,</p>
<p>who like him, from time to time, were cooped up in Bedford gaol,</p>
<p>including several of his brother ministers and some of his old</p>
<p>friends among the leading members of his own little church,</p>
<p>furnished a numerous and sympathetic congregation.  At one time a</p>
<p>body of some sixty, who had met for worship at night in a</p>
<p>neighbouring wood, were marched off to gaol, with their minister at</p>
<p>their head.  But while all about him was in confusion, his spirit</p>
<p>maintained its even calm, and he could at once speak the words of</p>
<p>strength and comfort that were needed.  In the midst of the hurry</p>
<p>which so many &quot;newcomers occasioned,&quot; writes the friend to whom we</p>
<p>are indebted for the details of his prison life, &quot;I have heard Mr.</p>
<p>Bunyan both preach and pray with that mighty spirit of faith and</p>
<p>plerophory of Divine assistance that has made me stand and wonder.&quot;</p>
<p>These sermons addressed to his fellow prisoners supplied, in many</p>
<p>cases, the first outlines of the books which, in rapid succession,</p>
<p>flowed from his pen during the earlier years of his imprisonment,</p>
<p>relieving the otherwise insupportable tedium of his close</p>
<p>confinement.  Bunyan himself tells us that this was the case with</p>
<p>regard to his &quot;Holy City,&quot; the first idea of which was borne in</p>
<p>upon his mind when addressing &quot;his brethren in the prison chamber,&quot;</p>
<p>nor can we doubt that the case was the same with other works of</p>
<p>his.  To these we shall hereafter return.  Nor was it his fellow</p>
<p>prisoners only who profited by his counsels.  In his &quot;Life and</p>
<p>Death of Mr. Badman,&quot; he gives us a story of a woman who came to</p>
<p>him when he was in prison, to confess how she had robbed her</p>
<p>master, and to ask his help.  Hers was probably a representative</p>
<p>case.  The time spared from his handicraft, and not employed in</p>
<p>religious counsel and exhortation, was given to study and</p>
<p>composition.  For this his confinement secured him the leisure</p>
<p>which otherwise he would have looked for in vain.  The few books he</p>
<p>possessed he studied indefatigably.  His library was, at least at</p>
<p>one period, a very limited one, - &quot;the least and the best library,&quot;</p>
<p>writes a friend who visited him in prison, &quot;that I ever saw,</p>
<p>consisting only of two books - the Bible, and Foxe&#x27;s &#x27;Book of</p>
<p>Martyrs.&#x27;&quot;  &quot;But with these two books,&quot; writes Mr. Froude, &quot;he had</p>
<p>no cause to complain of intellectual destitution.&quot;  Bunyan&#x27;s mode</p>
<p>of composition, though certainly exceedingly rapid, - thoughts</p>
<p>succeeding one another with a quickness akin to inspiration, - was</p>
<p>anything but careless.  The &quot;limae labor&quot; with him was unsparing.</p>
<p>It was, he tells us, &quot;first with doing, and then with undoing, and</p>
<p>after that with doing again,&quot; that his books were brought to</p>
<p>completion, and became what they are, a mine of Evangelical</p>
<p>Calvinism of the richest ore, entirely free from the narrow</p>
<p>dogmatism and harsh predestinarianism of the great Genevan divine;</p>
<p>books which for clearness of thought, lucidity of arrangement,</p>
<p>felicity of language, rich even if sometimes homely force of</p>
<p>illustration, and earnestness of piety have never been surpassed.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s prison life when the first bitterness of it was past, and</p>
<p>habit had done away with its strangeness, was a quiet and it would</p>
<p>seem, not an unhappy one.  A manly self-respect bore him up and</p>
<p>forbade his dwelling on the darker features of his position, or</p>
<p>thinking or speaking harshly of the authors of his durance.  &quot;He</p>
<p>was,&quot; writes one who saw him at this time, &quot;mild and affable in</p>
<p>conversation; not given to loquacity or to much discourse unless</p>
<p>some urgent occasion required.  It was observed he never spoke of</p>
<p>himself or his parents, but seemed low in his own eyes.  He was</p>
<p>never heard to reproach or revile, whatever injury he received, but</p>
<p>rather rebuked those who did so.  He managed all things with such</p>
<p>exactness as if he had made it his study not to give offence.&quot;</p>
<p>According to his earliest biographer, Charles Doe, in 1666, the</p>
<p>year of the Fire of London, after Bunyan had lain six years in</p>
<p>Bedford gaol, &quot;by the intercession of some interest or power that</p>
<p>took pity on his sufferings,&quot; he enjoyed a short interval of</p>
<p>liberty.  Who these friends and sympathisers were is not mentioned,</p>
<p>and it would be vain to conjecture.  This period of freedom,</p>
<p>however, was very short.  He at once resumed his old work of</p>
<p>preaching, against which the laws had become even more stringent</p>
<p>during his imprisonment, and was apprehended at a meeting just as</p>
<p>he was about to preach a sermon.  He had given out his text, &quot;Dost</p>
<p>thou believe on the Son of God?&quot; (John ix. 35), and was standing</p>
<p>with his open Bible in his hand, when the constable came in to take</p>
<p>him.  Bunyan fixed his eyes on the man, who turned pale, let go his</p>
<p>hold, and drew back, while Bunyan exclaimed, &quot;See how this man</p>
<p>trembles at the word of God!&quot;  This is all we know of his second</p>
<p>arrest, and even this little is somewhat doubtful.  The time, the</p>
<p>place, the circumstances, are as provokingly vague as much else of</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s life.  The fact, however, is certain.  Bunyan returned to</p>
<p>Bedford gaol, where he spent another six years, until the issuing</p>
<p>of the &quot;Declaration of Indulgence&quot; early in 1672 opened the long-</p>
<p>closed doors, and he walked out a free man, and with what he valued</p>
<p>far more than personal liberty, freedom to deliver Christ&#x27;s message</p>
<p>as he understood it himself, none making him afraid, and to declare</p>
<p>to his brother sinners what their Saviour had done for them, and</p>
<p>what he expected them to do that they might obtain the salvation He</p>
<p>died to win.</p>
<p>From some unknown cause, perhaps the depressing effect of</p>
<p>protracted confinement, during this second six years Bunyan&#x27;s pen</p>
<p>was far less prolific than during the former period.  Only two of</p>
<p>his books are dated in these years.  The last of these, &quot;A Defence</p>
<p>of the Doctrine of Justification by Faith,&quot; a reply to a work of</p>
<p>Edward Fowler, afterwards Bishop of Gloucester, the rector of</p>
<p>Northill, was written in hot haste immediately before his release,</p>
<p>and issued from the press contemporaneously with it, the prospect</p>
<p>of liberty apparently breathing new life into his wearied soul.</p>
<p>When once Bunyan became a free man again, his pen recovered its</p>
<p>former copiousness of production, and the works by which he has</p>
<p>been immortalized, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; - which has been</p>
<p>erroneously ascribed to Bunyan&#x27;s twelve years&#x27; imprisonment - and</p>
<p>its sequel, &quot;The Holy War,&quot; and the &quot;Life and Death of Mr. Badman,&quot;</p>
<p>and a host of more strictly theological works, followed one another</p>
<p>in rapid succession.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s second term of imprisonment was certainly less severe than</p>
<p>that which preceded it.  At its commencement we learn that, like</p>
<p>Joseph in Egypt, he found favour in his jailer&#x27;s eyes, who &quot;took</p>
<p>such pity of his rigorous suffering, that he put all care and trust</p>
<p>into his hands.&quot;  Towards the close of his imprisonment its rigour</p>
<p>was still further relaxed.  The Bedford church book begins its</p>
<p>record again in 1688, after an interval of ominous silence of five</p>
<p>years, when the persecution was at the hottest.  In its earliest</p>
<p>entries we find Bunyan&#x27;s name, which occurs repeatedly up to the</p>
<p>date of his final release in 1672.  Not one of these notices gives</p>
<p>the slightest allusion of his being a prisoner.  He is deputed with</p>
<p>others to visit and remonstrate with backsliding brethren, and</p>
<p>fulfil other commissions on behalf of the congregation, as if he</p>
<p>were in the full enjoyment of his liberty.  This was in the two</p>
<p>years&#x27; interval between the expiration of the Conventicle Act,</p>
<p>March 2, 1667-8, and the passing of the new Act, styled by Marvell,</p>
<p>&quot;the quintessence of arbitrary malice,&quot; April 11, 1670.  After a</p>
<p>few months of hot persecution, when a disgraceful system of</p>
<p>espionage was set on foot and the vilest wretches drove a lucrative</p>
<p>trade as spies on &quot;meetingers,&quot; the severity greatly lessened.</p>
<p>Charles II. was already meditating the issuing of a Declaration of</p>
<p>Indulgence, and signified his disapprobation of the &quot;forceable</p>
<p>courses&quot; in which, &quot;the sad experience of twelve years&quot; showed,</p>
<p>there was &quot;very little fruit.&quot;  One of the first and most notable</p>
<p>consequences of this change of policy was Bunyan&#x27;s release.</p>
<p>Mr. Offor&#x27;s patient researches in the State Paper Office have</p>
<p>proved that the Quakers, than whom no class of sectaries had</p>
<p>suffered more severely from the persecuting edicts of the Crown,</p>
<p>were mainly instrumental in throwing open the prison doors to those</p>
<p>who, like Bunyan, were in bonds for the sake of their religion.</p>
<p>Gratitude to John Groves, the Quaker mate of Tattersall&#x27;s fishing</p>
<p>boat, in which Charles had escaped to France after the battle of</p>
<p>Worcester, had something, and the untiring advocacy of George</p>
<p>Whitehead, the Quaker, had still more, to do with this act of royal</p>
<p>clemency.  We can readily believe that the good-natured Charles was</p>
<p>not sorry to have an opportunity of evidencing his sense of former</p>
<p>services rendered at a time of his greatest extremity.  But the</p>
<p>main cause lay much deeper, and is connected with what Lord</p>
<p>Macaulay justly styles &quot;one of the worst acts of one of the worst</p>
<p>governments that England has ever seen&quot; - that of the Cabal.  Our</p>
<p>national honour was at its lowest ebb.  Charles had just concluded</p>
<p>the profligate Treaty of Dover, by which, in return for the</p>
<p>&quot;protection&quot; he sought from the French king, he declared himself a</p>
<p>Roman Catholic at heart, and bound himself to take the first</p>
<p>opportunity of &quot;changing the present state of religion in England</p>
<p>for a better,&quot; and restoring the authority of the Pope.  The</p>
<p>announcement of his conversion Charles found it convenient to</p>
<p>postpone.  Nor could the other part of his engagement be safely</p>
<p>carried into effect at once.  It called for secret and cautious</p>
<p>preparation.  But to pave the way for it, by an unconstitutional</p>
<p>exercise of his prerogative he issued a Declaration of Indulgence</p>
<p>which suspended all penal laws against &quot;whatever sort of</p>
<p>Nonconformists or Recusants.&quot;  The latter were evidently the real</p>
<p>object of the indulgence; the former class were only introduced the</p>
<p>better to cloke his infamous design.  Toleration, however, was thus</p>
<p>at last secured, and the long-oppressed Nonconformists hastened to</p>
<p>profit by it.  &quot;Ministers returned,&quot; writes Mr. J. R. Green, &quot;after</p>
<p>years of banishment, to their homes and their flocks.  Chapels were</p>
<p>re-opened.  The gaols were emptied.  Men were set free to worship</p>
<p>God after their own fashion.  John Bunyan left the prison which had</p>
<p>for twelve years been his home.&quot;  More than three thousand licenses</p>
<p>to preach were at once issued.  One of the earliest of these, dated</p>
<p>May 9, 1672, four months before his formal pardon under the Great</p>
<p>Seal, was granted to Bunyan, who in the preceding January had been</p>
<p>chosen their minister by the little congregation at Bedford, and</p>
<p>&quot;giving himself up to serve Christ and His Church in that charge,</p>
<p>had received of the elders the right hand of fellowship.&quot;  The</p>
<p>place licensed for the exercise of Bunyan&#x27;s ministry was a barn</p>
<p>standing in an orchard, once forming part of the Castle Moat, which</p>
<p>one of the congregation, Josias Roughead, acting for the members of</p>
<p>his church, had purchased.  The license bears date May 9, 1672.</p>
<p>This primitive place of worship, in which Bunyan preached regularly</p>
<p>till his death, was pulled down in 1707, when a &quot;three-ridged</p>
<p>meeting-house&quot; was erected in its place.  This in its turn gave</p>
<p>way, in 1849, to the existing more seemly chapel, to which the</p>
<p>present Duke of Bedford, in 1876, presented a pair of noble bronze</p>
<p>doors bearing scenes, in high relief, from &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>Progress,&quot; the work of Mr. Frederick Thrupp.  In the vestry are</p>
<p>preserved Bunyan&#x27;s chair, and other relics of the man who has made</p>
<p>the name of Bedford famous to the whole civilized world.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<p>Mr. Green has observed that Bunyan &quot;found compensation for the</p>
<p>narrow bounds of his prison in the wonderful activity of his pen.</p>
<p>Tracts, controversial treatises, poems, meditations, his &#x27;Grace</p>
<p>Abounding,&#x27; and his &#x27;Holy War,&#x27; followed each other in quick</p>
<p>succession.&quot;  Bunyan&#x27;s literary fertility in the earlier half of</p>
<p>his imprisonment was indeed amazing.  Even if, as seems almost</p>
<p>certain, we have been hitherto in error in assigning the First Part</p>
<p>of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; to this period, while the &quot;Holy War&quot;</p>
<p>certainly belongs to a later, the works which had their birth in</p>
<p>Bedford Gaol during the first six years of his confinement, are of</p>
<p>themselves sufficient to make the reputation of any ordinary</p>
<p>writer.  As has been already remarked, for some unexplained cause,</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s gifts as an author were much more sparingly called into</p>
<p>exercise during the second half of his captivity.  Only two works</p>
<p>appear to have been written between 1666 and his release in 1672.</p>
<p>Mr. Green has spoken of &quot;poems&quot; as among the products of Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>pen during this period.  The compositions in verse belonging to</p>
<p>this epoch, of which there are several, hardly deserve to be</p>
<p>dignified with so high a title.  At no part of his life had Bunyan</p>
<p>much title to be called a poet.  He did not aspire beyond the rank</p>
<p>of a versifier, who clothed his thoughts in rhyme or metre instead</p>
<p>of the more congenial prose, partly for the pleasure of the</p>
<p>exercise, partly because he knew by experience that the lessons he</p>
<p>wished to inculcate were more likely to be remembered in that form.</p>
<p>Mr. Froude, who takes a higher estimate of Bunyan&#x27;s verse than is</p>
<p>commonly held, remarks that though it is the fashion to apply the</p>
<p>epithet of &quot;doggerel&quot; to it, the &quot;sincere and rational meaning&quot;</p>
<p>which pervades his compositions renders such an epithet improper.</p>
<p>&quot;His ear for rhythm,&quot; he continues, &quot;though less true than in his</p>
<p>prose, is seldom wholly at fault, and whether in prose or verse, he</p>
<p>had the superlative merit that he could never write nonsense.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s earliest prison work, entitled &quot;Profitable Meditations,&quot;</p>
<p>was in verse, and neither this nor his later metrical ventures</p>
<p>before his release - his &quot;Four Last Things,&quot; his &quot;Ebal and</p>
<p>Gerizim,&quot; and his &quot;Prison Meditations&quot; - can be said to show much</p>
<p>poetical power.  At best he is a mere rhymester, to whom rhyme and</p>
<p>metre, even when self-chosen, were as uncongenial accoutrements &quot;as</p>
<p>Saul&#x27;s armour was to David.&quot;  The first-named book, which is</p>
<p>entitled a &quot;Conference between Christ and a Sinner,&quot; in the form of</p>
<p>a poetical dialogue, according to Dr. Brown has &quot;small literary</p>
<p>merit of any sort.&quot;  The others do not deserve much higher</p>
<p>commendation.  There is an individuality about the &quot;Prison</p>
<p>Meditations&quot; which imparts to it a personal interest, which is</p>
<p>entirely wanting in the other two works, which may be characterized</p>
<p>as metrical sermons, couched in verse of the Sternhold and Hopkins</p>
<p>type.  A specimen or two will suffice.  The &quot;Four Last Things&quot; thus</p>
<p>opens:-</p>
<p>&quot;These lines I at this time present</p>
<p>To all that will them heed,</p>
<p>Wherein I show to what intent</p>
<p>God saith, &#x27;Convert with speed.&#x27;</p>
<p>For these four things come on apace,</p>
<p>Which we should know full well,</p>
<p>Both death and judgment, and, in place</p>
<p>Next to them, heaven and hell.&quot;</p>
<p>The following lines are from &quot;Ebal and Gerizim&quot;:-</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art like one that hangeth by a thread</p>
<p>Over the mouth of hell, as one half dead;</p>
<p>And oh, how soon this thread may broken be,</p>
<p>Or cut by death, is yet unknown to thee.</p>
<p>But sure it is if all the weight of sin,</p>
<p>And all that Satan too hath doing been</p>
<p>Or yet can do, can break this crazy thread,</p>
<p>&#x27;Twill not be long before among the dead</p>
<p>Thou tumble do, as linked fast in chains,</p>
<p>With them to wait in fear for future pains.&quot;</p>
<p>The poetical effusion entitled &quot;Prison Meditations&quot; does not in any</p>
<p>way rise above the prosaic level of its predecessors.  But it can</p>
<p>be read with less weariness from the picture it presents of</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s prison life, and of the courageous faith which sustained</p>
<p>him.  Some unnamed friend, it would appear, fearing he might</p>
<p>flinch, had written him a letter counselling him to keep &quot;his head</p>
<p>above the flood.&quot;  Bunyan replied in seventy stanzas in ballad</p>
<p>measure, thanking his correspondent for his good advice, of which</p>
<p>he confesses he stood in need, and which he takes it kindly of him</p>
<p>to send, even though his feet stand upon Mount Zion, and the gaol</p>
<p>is to him like a hill from which he could see beyond this world,</p>
<p>and take his fill of the blessedness of that which remains for the</p>
<p>Christian.  Though in bonds his mind is free, and can wander where</p>
<p>it will.</p>
<p>&quot;For though men keep my outward man</p>
<p>Within their locks and bars,</p>
<p>Yet by the faith of Christ, I can</p>
<p>Mount higher than the stars.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile his captivity is sweetened by the thought of what it was</p>
<p>that brought him there:-</p>
<p>&quot;I here am very much refreshed</p>
<p>To think, when I was out,</p>
<p>I preached life, and peace, and rest,</p>
<p>To sinners round about.</p>
<p>My business then was souls to save</p>
<p>By preaching grace and faith,</p>
<p>Of which the comfort now I have</p>
<p>And have it shall till death.</p>
<p>That was the work I was about</p>
<p>When hands on me they laid.</p>
<p>&#x27;Twas this for which they plucked me out</p>
<p>And vilely to me said,</p>
<p>&#x27;You heretic, deceiver, come,</p>
<p>To prison you must go,</p>
<p>You preach abroad, and keep not home,</p>
<p>You are the Church&#x27;s foe.&#x27;</p>
<p>Wherefore to prison they me sent,</p>
<p>Where to this day I lie,</p>
<p>And can with very much content</p>
<p>For my profession die.</p>
<p>The prison very sweet to me</p>
<p>Hath been since I came here,</p>
<p>And so would also hanging be</p>
<p>If God would there appear.</p>
<p>To them that here for evil lie</p>
<p>The place is comfortless;</p>
<p>But not to me, because that I</p>
<p>Lie here for righteousness.</p>
<p>The truth and I were both here cast</p>
<p>Together, and we do</p>
<p>Lie arm in arm, and so hold fast</p>
<p>Each other, this is true.</p>
<p>Who now dare say we throw away</p>
<p>Our goods or liberty,</p>
<p>When God&#x27;s most holy Word doth say</p>
<p>We gain thus much thereby?&quot;</p>
<p>It will be seen that though Bunyan&#x27;s verses are certainly not high-</p>
<p>class poetry, they are very far removed from doggerel.  Nothing</p>
<p>indeed that Bunyan ever wrote, however rugged the rhymes and</p>
<p>limping the metre, can be so stigmatized.  The rude scribblings on</p>
<p>the margins of the copy of the &quot;Book of Martyrs,&quot; which bears</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s signature on the title-pages, though regarded by Southey</p>
<p>as &quot;undoubtedly&quot; his, certainly came from a later and must less</p>
<p>instructed pen.  And as he advanced in his literary career, his</p>
<p>claim to the title of a poet, though never of the highest, was much</p>
<p>strengthened.  The verses which diversify the narrative in the</p>
<p>Second Part of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; are decidedly superior to</p>
<p>those in the First Part, and some are of high excellence.  Who is</p>
<p>ignorant of the charming little song of the Shepherd Boy in the</p>
<p>Valley of Humiliation, &quot;in very mean clothes, but with a very fresh</p>
<p>and well-favoured countenance, and wearing more of the herb called</p>
<p>Heartsease in his bosom than he that is clad in silk and velvet?&quot; -</p>
<p>&quot;He that is down need fear no fall;</p>
<p>He that is low, no pride;</p>
<p>He that is humble, ever shall</p>
<p>Have God to be his guide.</p>
<p>I am content with what I have,</p>
<p>Little be it or much,</p>
<p>And, Lord, contentment still I crave,</p>
<p>Because Thou savest such.</p>
<p>Fulness to such a burden is</p>
<p>That go on Pilgrimage,</p>
<p>Here little, and hereafter Bliss</p>
<p>Is best from age to age.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan reaches a still higher flight in Valiant-for-Truth&#x27;s song,</p>
<p>later on, the Shakesperian ring of which recalls Amiens&#x27; in &quot;As You</p>
<p>Like It,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Under the greenwood tree,</p>
<p>Who loves to lie with me. . .</p>
<p>Come hither, come hither,&quot;</p>
<p>and has led some to question whether it can be Bunyan&#x27;s own.  The</p>
<p>resemblance, as Mr. Froude remarks, is &quot;too near to be accidental.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps he may have heard the lines, and the rhymes may have clung</p>
<p>to him without his knowing whence they came.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who would true Valour see,</p>
<p>Let him come hither,</p>
<p>One here will constant be,</p>
<p>Come wind, come weather.</p>
<p>There&#x27;s no discouragement</p>
<p>Shall make him once relent</p>
<p>His first avowed intent</p>
<p>To be a Pilgrim.</p>
<p>Who so beset him round</p>
<p>With dismal stories,</p>
<p>Do but themselves confound</p>
<p>His strength the more is.</p>
<p>No lion can him fright,</p>
<p>He&#x27;ll with a giant fight,</p>
<p>But he will have a right</p>
<p>To be a Pilgrim.</p>
<p>Hobgoblin nor foul fiend</p>
<p>Can daunt his spirit,</p>
<p>He knows he at the end</p>
<p>Shall life inherit.</p>
<p>Then fancies fly away</p>
<p>He&#x27;ll fear not what men say,</p>
<p>He&#x27;ll labour night and day</p>
<p>To be a Pilgrim.&quot;</p>
<p>All readers of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and &quot;The Holy War&quot; are</p>
<p>familiar with the long metrical compositions giving the history of</p>
<p>these works by which they are prefaced and the latter work is</p>
<p>closed.  No more characteristic examples of Bunyan&#x27;s muse can be</p>
<p>found.  They show his excellent command of his native tongue in</p>
<p>racy vernacular, homely but never vulgar, and his power of</p>
<p>expressing his meaning &quot;with sharp defined outlines and without the</p>
<p>waste of a word.&quot;</p>
<p>Take this account of his perplexity, when the First Part of his</p>
<p>&quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was finished, whether it should be given to</p>
<p>the world or no, and the characteristic decision with which he</p>
<p>settled the question for himself:-</p>
<p>&quot;Well, when I had then put mine ends together,</p>
<p>I show&#x27;d them others that I might see whether</p>
<p>They would condemn them, or them justify;</p>
<p>And some said Let them live; some, Let them die.</p>
<p>Some said, John, print it; others said, Not so;</p>
<p>Some said it might do good; others said No.</p>
<p>Now was I in a strait, and did not see</p>
<p>Which was the best thing to be done by me;</p>
<p>At last I thought since you are thus divided</p>
<p>I print it will; and so the case decided;&quot;</p>
<p>or the lines in which he introduces the Second Part of the Pilgrim</p>
<p>to the readers of the former part:-</p>
<p>&quot;Go now, my little Book, to every place</p>
<p>Where my first Pilgrim hath but shown his face:</p>
<p>Call at their door:  If any say, &#x27;Who&#x27;s there?&#x27;</p>
<p>Then answer that Christiana is here.</p>
<p>If they bid thee come in, then enter thou</p>
<p>With all thy boys.  And then, as thou knowest how,</p>
<p>Tell who they are, also from whence they came;</p>
<p>Perhaps they&#x27;ll know them by their looks or name.</p>
<p>But if they should not, ask them yet again</p>
<p>If formerly they did not entertain</p>
<p>One Christian, a pilgrim.  If they say</p>
<p>They did, and were delighted in his way:</p>
<p>Then let them know that these related are</p>
<p>Unto him, yea, his wife and children are.</p>
<p>Tell them that they have left their house and home,</p>
<p>Are turned Pilgrims, seek a world to come;</p>
<p>That they have met with hardships on the way,</p>
<p>That they do meet with troubles night and day.&quot;</p>
<p>How racy, even if the lines are a little halting, is the defence of</p>
<p>the genuineness of his Pilgrim in &quot;The Advertisement to the Reader&quot;</p>
<p>at the end of &quot;The Holy War.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some say the Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress is not mine,</p>
<p>Insinuating as if I would shine</p>
<p>In name or fame by the worth of another,</p>
<p>Like some made rich by robbing of their brother;</p>
<p>Or that so fond I am of being sire</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll father bastards; or if need require,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll tell a lie or print to get applause.</p>
<p>I scorn it.  John such dirt-heap never was</p>
<p>Since God converted him. . .</p>
<p>Witness my name, if anagram&#x27;d to thee</p>
<p>The letters make NU HONY IN A B.</p>
<p>IOHN BUNYAN.&quot;</p>
<p>How full of life and vigour his sketch of the beleaguerment and</p>
<p>deliverance of &quot;Mansoul,&quot; as a picture of his own spiritual</p>
<p>experience, in the introductory verses to &quot;The Holy War&quot;! -</p>
<p>&quot;For my part I, myself, was in the town,</p>
<p>Both when &#x27;twas set up, and when pulling down;</p>
<p>I saw Diabolus in possession,</p>
<p>And Mansoul also under his oppression.</p>
<p>Yes, I was there when she crowned him for lord,</p>
<p>And to him did submit with one accord.</p>
<p>When Mansoul trampled upon things divine,</p>
<p>And wallowed in filth as doth a swine,</p>
<p>When she betook herself unto her arms,</p>
<p>Fought her Emmanuel, despised his charms:</p>
<p>Then I was there, and did rejoice to see</p>
<p>Diabolus and Mansoul so agree.</p>
<p>I saw the prince&#x27;s armed men come down</p>
<p>By troops, by thousands, to besiege the town,</p>
<p>I saw the captains, heard the trumpets sound,</p>
<p>And how his forces covered all the ground,</p>
<p>Yea, how they set themselves in battle array,</p>
<p>I shall remember to my dying day.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s other essays in the domain of poetry need not detain us</p>
<p>long.  The most considerable of these - at least in bulk - if it be</p>
<p>really his, is a version of some portions of the Old and New</p>
<p>Testaments:  the life of Joseph, the Book of Ruth, the history of</p>
<p>Samson, the Book of Jonah, the Sermon on the Mount, and the General</p>
<p>Epistle of St. James.  The attempt to do the English Bible into</p>
<p>verse has been often made and never successfully:  in the nature of</p>
<p>things success in such a task is impossible, nor can this attempt</p>
<p>be regarded as happier than that of others.  Mr. Froude indeed, who</p>
<p>undoubtingly accepts their genuineness, is of a different opinion.</p>
<p>He styles the &quot;Book of Ruth&quot; and the &quot;History of Joseph&quot; &quot;beautiful</p>
<p>idylls,&quot; of such high excellence that, &quot;if we found them in the</p>
<p>collected works of a poet laureate, we should consider that a</p>
<p>difficult task had been accomplished successfully.&quot;  It would seem</p>
<p>almost doubtful whether Mr. Froude can have read the compositions</p>
<p>that he commends so largely, and so much beyond their merit.  The</p>
<p>following specimen, taken haphazard, will show how thoroughly</p>
<p>Bunyan or the rhymester, whoever he may be, has overcome what Mr.</p>
<p>Froude regards as an almost insuperable difficulty, and has managed</p>
<p>to &quot;spoil completely the faultless prose of the English</p>
<p>translation&quot;:-</p>
<p>&quot;Ruth replied,</p>
<p>Intreat me not to leave thee or return;</p>
<p>For where thou goest I&#x27;ll go, where thou sojourn</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll sojourn also - and what people&#x27;s thine,</p>
<p>And who thy God, the same shall both be mine.</p>
<p>Where thou shalt die, there will I die likewise,</p>
<p>And I&#x27;ll be buried where thy body lies.</p>
<p>The Lord do so to me and more if I</p>
<p>Do leave thee or forsake thee till I die.&quot;</p>
<p>The more we read of these poems, not given to the world till twelve</p>
<p>years after Bunyan&#x27;s death, and that by a publisher who was &quot;a</p>
<p>repeated offender against the laws of honest dealing,&quot; the more we</p>
<p>are inclined to agree with Dr. Brown, that the internal evidence of</p>
<p>their style renders their genuineness at the least questionable.</p>
<p>In the dull prosaic level of these compositions there is certainly</p>
<p>no trace of the &quot;force and power&quot; always present in Bunyan&#x27;s rudest</p>
<p>rhymes, still less of the &quot;dash of genius&quot; and the &quot;sparkle of</p>
<p>soul&quot; which occasionally discover the hand of a master.</p>
<p>Of the authenticity of Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;Divine Emblems,&quot; originally</p>
<p>published three years after his death under the title of &quot;Country</p>
<p>Rhymes for Children,&quot; there is no question.  The internal evidence</p>
<p>confirms the external.  The book is thoroughly in Bunyan&#x27;s vein,</p>
<p>and in its homely naturalness of imagery recalls the similitudes of</p>
<p>the &quot;Interpreter&#x27;s House,&quot; especially those expounded to Christiana</p>
<p>and her boys.  As in that &quot;house of imagery&quot; things of the most</p>
<p>common sort, the sweeping of a room, the burning of a fire, the</p>
<p>drinking of a chicken, a robin with a spider in his mouth, are made</p>
<p>the vehicle of religious teaching; so in this &quot;Book for Boys and</p>
<p>Girls,&quot; a mole burrowing in the ground, a swallow soaring in the</p>
<p>air, the cuckoo which can do nothing but utter two notes, a flaming</p>
<p>and a blinking candle, or a pound of candles falling to the ground,</p>
<p>a boy chasing a butterfly, the cackling of a hen when she has laid</p>
<p>her egg, all, to his imaginative mind, set forth some spiritual</p>
<p>truth or enforce some wholesome moral lesson.  How racy, though</p>
<p>homely, are these lines on a Frog! -</p>
<p>&quot;The Frog by nature is but damp and cold,</p>
<p>Her mouth is large, her belly much will hold,</p>
<p>She sits somewhat ascending, loves to be</p>
<p>Croaking in gardens, though unpleasantly.</p>
<p>The hypocrite is like unto this Frog,</p>
<p>As like as is the puppy to the dog.</p>
<p>He is of nature cold, his mouth is wide</p>
<p>To prate, and at true goodness to deride.</p>
<p>And though this world is that which he doth love,</p>
<p>He mounts his head as if he lived above.</p>
<p>And though he seeks in churches for to croak,</p>
<p>He neither seeketh Jesus nor His yoke.&quot;</p>
<p>There is some real poetry in those on the Cuckoo, though we may be</p>
<p>inclined to resent his harsh treatment of our universal favourite:-</p>
<p>&quot;Thou booby says&#x27;t thou nothing but Cuckoo?</p>
<p>The robin and the wren can that outdo.</p>
<p>They to us play thorough their little throats</p>
<p>Not one, but sundry pretty tuneful notes.</p>
<p>But thou hast fellows, some like thee can do</p>
<p>Little but suck our eggs, and sing Cuckoo.</p>
<p>Thy notes do not first welcome in our spring,</p>
<p>Nor dost thou its first tokens to us bring.</p>
<p>Birds less than thee by far like prophets do</p>
<p>Tell us &#x27;tis coming, though not by Cuckoo,</p>
<p>Nor dost thou summer bear away with thee</p>
<p>Though thou a yawling bawling Cuckoo be.</p>
<p>When thou dost cease among us to appear,</p>
<p>Then doth our harvest bravely crown our year.</p>
<p>But thou hast fellows, some like thee can do</p>
<p>Little but suck our eggs, and sing Cuckoo.</p>
<p>Since Cuckoos forward not our early spring</p>
<p>Nor help with notes to bring our harvest in,</p>
<p>And since while here, she only makes a noise</p>
<p>So pleasing unto none as girls and boys,</p>
<p>The Formalist we may compare her to,</p>
<p>For he doth suck our eggs and sing Cuckoo.&quot;</p>
<p>A perusal of this little volume with its roughness and quaintness,</p>
<p>sometimes grating on the ear but full of strong thought and</p>
<p>picturesque images, cannot fail to raise Bunyan&#x27;s pretensions as a</p>
<p>poet.  His muse, it is true, as Alexander Smith has said, is a</p>
<p>homely one.  She is &quot;clad in russet, wears shoes and stockings, has</p>
<p>a country accent, and walks along the level Bedfordshire roads.&quot;</p>
<p>But if the lines are unpolished, &quot;they have pith and sinew, like</p>
<p>the talk of a shrewd peasant,&quot; with the &quot;strong thought and the</p>
<p>knack of the skilled workman who can drive by a single blow the</p>
<p>nail home to the head.&quot;</p>
<p>During his imprisonment Bunyan&#x27;s pen was much more fertile in prose</p>
<p>than in poetry.  Besides his world-famous &quot;Grace Abounding,&quot; he</p>
<p>produced during the first six years of his gaol life a treatise on</p>
<p>prayer, entitled &quot;Praying in the Spirit;&quot; a book on &quot;Christian</p>
<p>Behaviour,&quot; setting forth with uncompromising plainness the</p>
<p>relative duties of husbands and wives, parents and children,</p>
<p>masters and servants, by which those who profess a true faith are</p>
<p>bound to show forth its reality and power; the &quot;Holy City,&quot; an</p>
<p>exposition of the vision in the closing chapters of the Book of</p>
<p>Revelation, brilliant with picturesque description and rich in</p>
<p>suggestive thought, which, he tells us, had its origin in a sermon</p>
<p>preached by him to his brethren in bonds in their prison chamber;</p>
<p>and a work on the &quot;Resurrection of the Dead and Eternal Judgment.&quot;</p>
<p>On these works we may not linger.  There is not one of them which</p>
<p>is not marked by vigour of thought, clearness of language, accuracy</p>
<p>of arrangement, and deep spiritual experience.  Nor is there one</p>
<p>which does not here and there exhibit specimens of Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>picturesque imaginative power, and his command of forcible and racy</p>
<p>language.  Each will reward perusal.  His work on &quot;Prayer&quot; is</p>
<p>couched in the most exalted strain, and is evidently the production</p>
<p>of one who by long and agonizing experience had learnt the true</p>
<p>nature of prayer, as a pouring out of the soul to God, and a</p>
<p>wrestling with Him until the blessing, delayed not denied, is</p>
<p>granted.  It is, however, unhappily deformed by much ignorant</p>
<p>reviling of the Book of Common Prayer.  He denounces it as &quot;taken</p>
<p>out of the papistical mass-book, the scraps and fragments of some</p>
<p>popes, some friars, and I know not what;&quot; and ridicules the order</p>
<p>of service it propounds to the worshippers.  &quot;They have the matter</p>
<p>and the manner of their prayer at their fingers&#x27; ends; they set</p>
<p>such a prayer for such a day, and that twenty years before it</p>
<p>comes:  one for Christmas, another for Easter, and six days after</p>
<p>that.  They have also bounded how many syllables must be said in</p>
<p>every one of them at their public exercises.  For each saint&#x27;s day</p>
<p>also they have them ready for the generations yet unborn to say.</p>
<p>They can tell you also when you shall kneel, when you shall stand,</p>
<p>when you should abide in your seats, when you should go up into the</p>
<p>chancel, and what you should do when you come there.  All which the</p>
<p>apostles came short of, as not being able to compose so profound a</p>
<p>manner.&quot;  This bitter satirical vein in treating of sacred things</p>
<p>is unworthy of its author, and degrading to his sense of reverence.</p>
<p>It has its excuse in the hard measure he had received from those</p>
<p>who were so unwisely endeavouring to force the Prayer Book on a</p>
<p>generation which had largely forgotten it.  In his mind, the men</p>
<p>and the book were identified, and the unchristian behaviour of its</p>
<p>advocates blinded his eyes to its merits as a guide to devotion.</p>
<p>Bunyan, when denouncing forms in worship, forgot that the same</p>
<p>apostle who directs that in our public assemblies everything should</p>
<p>be done &quot;to edification,&quot; directs also that everything should be</p>
<p>done &quot;decently and in order.&quot;</p>
<p>By far the most important of these prison works - &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>Progress,&quot; belonging, as will be seen, to a later period - is the</p>
<p>&quot;Grace Abounding,&quot; in which with inimitable earnestness and</p>
<p>simplicity Bunyan gives the story of his early life and his</p>
<p>religious history.  This book, if he had written no other, would</p>
<p>stamp Bunyan as one of the greatest masters of the English language</p>
<p>of his own or any other age.  In graphic delineation of the</p>
<p>struggles of a conscience convicted of sin towards a hardly won</p>
<p>freedom and peace, the alternations of light and darkness, of hope</p>
<p>and despair, which chequered its course, its morbid self-torturing</p>
<p>questionings of motive and action, this work of the travelling</p>
<p>tinker, as a spiritual history, has never been surpassed.  Its</p>
<p>equal can hardly be found, save perhaps in the &quot;Confessions of St.</p>
<p>Augustine.&quot;  These, however, though describing a like spiritual</p>
<p>conflict, are couched in a more cultured style, and rise to a</p>
<p>higher metaphysical region than Bunyan was capable of attaining to.</p>
<p>His level is a lower one, but on that level Bunyan is without a</p>
<p>rival.  Never has the history of a soul convinced of the reality of</p>
<p>eternal perdition in its most terrible form as the most certain of</p>
<p>all possible facts, and of its own imminent danger of hopeless,</p>
<p>irreversible doom - seeing itself, to employ his own image,</p>
<p>hanging, as it were, over the pit of hell by a thin line, which</p>
<p>might snap any moment - been portrayed in more nervous and awe-</p>
<p>inspiring language.  And its awfulness is enhanced by its self-</p>
<p>evident truth.  Bunyan was drawing no imaginary picture of what</p>
<p>others might feel, but simply telling in plain unadorned language</p>
<p>what he had felt.  The experience was a very tremendous reality to</p>
<p>him.  Like Dante, if he had not actually been in hell, he had been</p>
<p>on the very threshold of it; he had in very deed traversed &quot;the</p>
<p>Valley of the Shadow of Death,&quot; had heard its &quot;hideous noises,&quot; and</p>
<p>seen &quot;the Hobgoblins of the Pit.&quot;  He &quot;spake what he knew and</p>
<p>testified what he had seen.&quot;  Every sentence breathes the most</p>
<p>tremendous earnestness.  His words are the plainest, drawn from his</p>
<p>own homely vernacular.  He says in his preface, which will amply</p>
<p>repay reading, as one of the most characteristic specimens of his</p>
<p>style, that he could have stepped into a higher style, and adorned</p>
<p>his narrative more plentifully.  But he dared not.  &quot;God did not</p>
<p>play in convincing him.  The devil did not play in tempting him.</p>
<p>He himself did not play when he sunk as into a bottomless pit, and</p>
<p>the pangs of hell caught hold on him.  Nor could he play in</p>
<p>relating them.  He must be plain and simple and lay down the thing</p>
<p>as it was.  He that liked it might receive it.  He that did not</p>
<p>might produce a better.&quot;  The remembrance of &quot;his great sins, his</p>
<p>great temptations, his great fears of perishing for ever, recalled</p>
<p>the remembrance of his great help, his great support from heaven,</p>
<p>the great grace God extended to such a wretch as he was.&quot;  Having</p>
<p>thus enlarged on his own experience, he calls on his spiritual</p>
<p>children, for whose use the work was originally composed and to</p>
<p>whom it is dedicated, - &quot;those whom God had counted him worthy to</p>
<p>beget to Faith by his ministry in the Word&quot; - to survey their own</p>
<p>religious history, to &quot;work diligently and leave no corner</p>
<p>unsearched.&quot;  He would have them &quot;remember their tears and prayers</p>
<p>to God; how they sighed under every hedge for mercy.  Had they</p>
<p>never a hill Mizar (Psa. xlii. 6) to remember?  Had they forgotten</p>
<p>the close, the milkhouse, the stable, the barn, where God visited</p>
<p>their souls?  Let them remember the Word on which the Lord had</p>
<p>caused them to hope.  If they had sinned against light, if they</p>
<p>were tempted to blaspheme, if they were down in despair, let them</p>
<p>remember that it had been so with him, their spiritual father, and</p>
<p>that out of them all the Lord had delivered him.&quot;  This dedication</p>
<p>ends thus:  &quot;My dear children, the milk and honey is beyond this</p>
<p>wilderness.  God be merciful to you, and grant you be not slothful</p>
<p>to go in to possess the land.&quot;</p>
<p>This remarkable book, as we learn from the title-page, was &quot;written</p>
<p>by his own hand in prison.&quot;  It was first published by George</p>
<p>Larkin in London, in 1666, the sixth year of his imprisonment, the</p>
<p>year of the Fire of London, about the time that he experienced his</p>
<p>first brief release.  As with &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress,&quot; the work</p>
<p>grew in picturesque detail and graphic power in the author&#x27;s hand</p>
<p>after its first appearance.  The later editions supply some of the</p>
<p>most interesting personal facts contained in the narrative, which</p>
<p>were wanting when it first issued from the press.  His two escapes</p>
<p>from drowning, and from the supposed sting of an adder; his being</p>
<p>drawn as a soldier, and his providential deliverance from death;</p>
<p>the graphic account of his difficulty in giving up bell-ringing at</p>
<p>Elstow Church, and dancing on Sundays on Elstow Green - these and</p>
<p>other minor touches which give a life and colour to the story,</p>
<p>which we should be very sorry to lose, are later additions.  It is</p>
<p>impossible to over-estimate the value of the &quot;Grace Abounding,&quot;</p>
<p>both for the facts of Bunyan&#x27;s earlier life and for the spiritual</p>
<p>experience of which these facts were, in his eyes only the outward</p>
<p>framework.  Beginning with his parentage and boyhood, it carries us</p>
<p>down to his marriage and life in the wayside-cottage at Elstow, his</p>
<p>introduction to Mr. Gifford&#x27;s congregation at Bedford, his joining</p>
<p>that holy brotherhood, and his subsequent call to the work of the</p>
<p>ministry among them, and winds up with an account of his</p>
<p>apprehension, examinations, and imprisonment in Bedford gaol.  The</p>
<p>work concludes with a report of the conversation between his noble-</p>
<p>hearted wife and Sir Matthew Hale and the other judges at the</p>
<p>Midsummer assizes, narrated in a former chapter, &quot;taken down,&quot; he</p>
<p>says, &quot;from her own mouth.&quot;  The whole story is of such sustained</p>
<p>interest that our chief regret on finishing it is that it stops</p>
<p>where it does, and does not go on much further.  Its importance for</p>
<p>our knowledge of Bunyan as a man, as distinguished from an author,</p>
<p>and of the circumstances of his life, is seen by a comparison of</p>
<p>our acquaintance with his earlier and with his later years.  When</p>
<p>he laid down his pen no one took it up, and beyond two or three</p>
<p>facts, and a few hazy anecdotes we know little or nothing of all</p>
<p>that happened between his final release and his death.</p>
<p>The value of the &quot;Grace Abounding,&quot; however, as a work of</p>
<p>experimental religion may be easily over-estimated.  It is not many</p>
<p>who can study Bunyan&#x27;s minute history of the various stages of his</p>
<p>spiritual life with real profit.  To some temperaments, especially</p>
<p>among the young, the book is more likely to prove injurious than</p>
<p>beneficial; it is calculated rather to nourish morbid imaginations,</p>
<p>and a dangerous habit of introspection, than to foster the quiet</p>
<p>growth of the inner life.  Bunyan&#x27;s unhappy mode of dealing with</p>
<p>the Bible as a collection of texts, each of Divine authority and</p>
<p>declaring a definite meaning entirely irrespective of its context,</p>
<p>by which the words hide the Word, is also utterly destructive of</p>
<p>the true purpose of the Holy Scriptures as a revelation of God&#x27;s</p>
<p>loving and holy mind and will.  Few things are more touching than</p>
<p>the eagerness with which, in his intense self-torture, Bunyan tried</p>
<p>to evade the force of those &quot;fearful and terrible Scriptures&quot; which</p>
<p>appeared to seal his condemnation, and to lay hold of the promises</p>
<p>to the penitent sinner.  His tempest-tossed spirit could only find</p>
<p>rest by doing violence to the dogma, then universally accepted and</p>
<p>not quite extinct even in our own days, that the authority of the</p>
<p>Bible - that &quot;Divine Library&quot; - collectively taken, belongs to each</p>
<p>and every sentence of the Bible taken for and by itself, and that,</p>
<p>in Coleridge&#x27;s words, &quot;detached sentences from books composed at</p>
<p>the distance of centuries, nay, sometimes at a millenium from each</p>
<p>other, under different dispensations and for different objects,&quot;</p>
<p>are to be brought together &quot;into logical dependency.&quot;  But &quot;where</p>
<p>the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty.&quot;  The divinely given</p>
<p>life in the soul of man snaps the bonds of humanly-constructed</p>
<p>logical systems.  Only those, however, who have known by experience</p>
<p>the force of Bunyan&#x27;s spiritual combat, can fully appreciate and</p>
<p>profit by Bunyan&#x27;s narrative.  He tells us on the title-page that</p>
<p>it was written &quot;for the support of the weak and tempted people of</p>
<p>God.&quot;  For such the &quot;Grace Abounding to the chief of sinners&quot; will</p>
<p>ever prove most valuable.  Those for whom it was intended will find</p>
<p>in it a message - of comfort and strength.</p>
<p>As has been said, Bunyan&#x27;s pen was almost idle during the last six</p>
<p>years of his imprisonment.  Only two of his works were produced in</p>
<p>this period:  his &quot;Confession of Faith,&quot; and his &quot;Defence of the</p>
<p>Doctrine of Justification by Faith.&quot;  Both were written very near</p>
<p>the end of his prison life, and published in the same year, 1672,</p>
<p>only a week or two before his release.  The object of the former</p>
<p>work was, as Dr. Brown tells us, &quot;to vindicate his teaching, and if</p>
<p>possible, to secure his liberty.&quot;  Writing as one &quot;in bonds for the</p>
<p>Gospel,&quot; his professed principles, he asserts, are &quot;faith, and</p>
<p>holiness springing therefrom, with an endeavour so far as in him</p>
<p>lies to be at peace with all men.&quot;  He is ready to hold communion</p>
<p>with all whose principles are the same; with all whom he can reckon</p>
<p>as children of God.  With these he will not quarrel about &quot;things</p>
<p>that are circumstantial,&quot; such as water baptism, which he regards</p>
<p>as something quite indifferent, men being &quot;neither the better for</p>
<p>having it, nor the worse for having it not.&quot;  &quot;He will receive them</p>
<p>in the Lord as becometh saints.  If they will not have communion</p>
<p>with him, the neglect is theirs not his.  But with the openly</p>
<p>profane and ungodly, though, poor people! they have been christened</p>
<p>and take the communion, he will have no communion.  It would be a</p>
<p>strange community, he says, that consisted of men and beasts.  Men</p>
<p>do not receive their horse or their dog to their table; they put</p>
<p>them in a room by themselves.&quot;  As regards forms and ceremonies, he</p>
<p>&quot;cannot allow his soul to be governed in its approach to God by the</p>
<p>superstitious inventions of this world.  He is content to stay in</p>
<p>prison even till the moss grows on his eyelids rather than thus</p>
<p>make of his conscience a continual butchery and slaughter-shop by</p>
<p>putting out his eyes and committing himself to the blind to lead</p>
<p>him.  Eleven years&#x27; imprisonment was a weighty argument to pause</p>
<p>and pause again over the foundation of the principles for which he</p>
<p>had thus suffered.  Those principles he had asserted at his trial,</p>
<p>and in the tedious tract of time since then he had in cold blood</p>
<p>examined them by the Word of God and found them good; nor could he</p>
<p>dare to revolt from or deny them on pain of eternal damnation.&quot;</p>
<p>The second-named work, the &quot;Defence of the Doctrine of</p>
<p>Justification by Faith,&quot; is entirely controversial.  The Rev.</p>
<p>Edward Fowler, afterwards Bishop of Gloucester, then Rector of</p>
<p>Northill, had published in the early part of 1671, a book entitled</p>
<p>&quot;The Design of Christianity.&quot;  A copy having found its way into</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s hands, he was so deeply stirred by what he deemed its</p>
<p>subversion of the true foundation of Evangelical religion that he</p>
<p>took up his pen and in the space of six weeks composed a long and</p>
<p>elaborate examination of the book, chapter by chapter, and a</p>
<p>confutation of its teaching.  Fowler&#x27;s doctrines as Bunyan</p>
<p>understood them - or rather misunderstood them - awoke the worst</p>
<p>side of his impetuous nature.  His vituperation of the author and</p>
<p>his book is coarse and unmeasured.  He roundly charges Fowler with</p>
<p>having &quot;closely, privily, and devilishly turned the grace of God</p>
<p>into a licentious doctrine, bespattering it with giving liberty to</p>
<p>lasciviousness;&quot; and he calls him &quot;a pretended minister of the</p>
<p>Word,&quot; who, in &quot;his cursed blasphemous book vilely exposes to</p>
<p>public view the rottenness of his heart, in principle diametrically</p>
<p>opposite to the simplicity of the Gospel of Christ, a glorious</p>
<p>latitudinarian that can, as to religion, turn and twist like an eel</p>
<p>on the angle, or rather like the weathercock that stands on the</p>
<p>steeple;&quot; and describes him as &quot;contradicting the wholesome</p>
<p>doctrine of the Church of England.&quot;  He &quot;knows him not by face much</p>
<p>less his personal practise.&quot;  He may have &quot;kept himself clear of</p>
<p>the ignorant Sir Johns who had for a long time, as a judgment of</p>
<p>God, been made the mouth to the people - men of debauched lives who</p>
<p>for the love of filthy lucre and the pampering of their idle</p>
<p>carcases had made shipwreck of their former faith;&quot; but he does</p>
<p>know that having been ejected as a Nonconformist in 1662, he had</p>
<p>afterwards gone over to the winning side, and he fears that &quot;such</p>
<p>an unstable weathercock spirit as he had manifested would stumble</p>
<p>the work and give advantage to the adversary to speak vilifyingly</p>
<p>of religion.&quot;  No excuse can be offered for the coarse violence of</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s language in this book; but it was too much the habit of</p>
<p>the time to load a theological opponent with vituperation, to push</p>
<p>his assertions to the furthest extreme, and make the most</p>
<p>unwarrantable deductions from them.  It must be acknowledged that</p>
<p>Bunyan does not treat Fowler and his doctrines with fairness, and</p>
<p>that, if the latter may be thought to depreciate unduly the</p>
<p>sacrifice of the Death of Christ as an expiation for man&#x27;s guilt,</p>
<p>and to lay too great a stress on the moral faculties remaining in</p>
<p>the soul after the Fall, Bunyan errs still more widely on the other</p>
<p>side in asserting the absolute, irredeemable corruption of human</p>
<p>nature, leaving nothing for grace to work upon, but demanding an</p>
<p>absolutely fresh creation, not a revivification of the Divine</p>
<p>nature grievously marred but not annihilated by Adam&#x27;s sin.</p>
<p>A reply to Bunyan&#x27;s severe strictures was not slow to appear.  The</p>
<p>book bears the title, characteristic of the tone and language of</p>
<p>its contents, of &quot;DIRT WIP&#x27;T OFF; or, a manifest discovery of the</p>
<p>Gross Ignorance, Erroneousness, and most Unchristian and Wicked</p>
<p>Spirit of one John Bunyan, Lay-preacher in Bedford.&quot;  It professes</p>
<p>to be written by a friend of Fowler&#x27;s, but Fowler was generally</p>
<p>accredited with it.  Its violent tirades against one who, he says,</p>
<p>had been &quot;near these twenty years or longer very infamous in the</p>
<p>Town and County of Bedford as a very Pestilent Schismatick,&quot; and</p>
<p>whom he suggests the authorities have done wrong in letting out of</p>
<p>prison, and had better clap in gaol again as &quot;an impudent and</p>
<p>malicious Firebrand,&quot; have long since been consigned to a merciful</p>
<p>oblivion, where we may safely leave them.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s protracted imprisonment came to an end in 1672.  The exact</p>
<p>date of his actual liberation is uncertain.  His pardon under the</p>
<p>Great Seal bears date September 13th.  But we find from the church</p>
<p>books that he had been appointed pastor of the congregation to</p>
<p>which he belonged as early as the 21st of January of that year, and</p>
<p>on the 9th of May his ministerial position was duly recognized by</p>
<p>the Government, and a license was granted to him to act &quot;as</p>
<p>preacher in the house of Josias Roughead,&quot; for those &quot;of the</p>
<p>Persuasion commonly called Congregational.&quot;  His release would</p>
<p>therefore seem to have anticipated the formal issue of his pardon</p>
<p>by four months.  Bunyan was now half way through his forty-fourth</p>
<p>year.  Sixteen years still remained to him before his career of</p>
<p>indefatigable service in the Master&#x27;s work was brought to a close.</p>
<p>Of these sixteen years, as has already been remarked, we have only</p>
<p>a very general knowledge.  Details are entirely wanting; nor is</p>
<p>there any known source from which they can be recovered.  If he</p>
<p>kept any diary it has not been preserved.  If he wrote letters -</p>
<p>and one who was looked up to by so large a circle of disciples as a</p>
<p>spiritual father and guide, and whose pen was so ready of exercise,</p>
<p>cannot fail to have written many - not one has come down to us.</p>
<p>The pages of the church books during his pastorate are also</p>
<p>provokingly barren of record, and little that they contain is in</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s handwriting.  As Dr. Brown has said, &quot;he seems to have</p>
<p>been too busy to keep any records of his busy life.&quot;  Nor can we</p>
<p>fill up the blank from external authorities.  The references to</p>
<p>Bunyan in contemporary biographies are far fewer than we might have</p>
<p>expected; certainly far fewer than we could have desired.  But the</p>
<p>little that is recorded is eminently characteristic.  We see him</p>
<p>constantly engaged in the great work to which he felt God had</p>
<p>called him, and for which, &quot;with much content through grace,&quot; he</p>
<p>had suffered twelve years&#x27; incarceration.  In addition to the</p>
<p>regular discharge of his pastoral duties to his own congregation,</p>
<p>he took a general oversight of the villages far and near which had</p>
<p>been the scene of his earlier ministry, preaching whenever</p>
<p>opportunity offered, and, ever unsparing of his own personal</p>
<p>labour, making long journeys into distant parts of the country for</p>
<p>the furtherance of the gospel.  We find him preaching at Leicester</p>
<p>in the year of his release.  Reading also is mentioned as receiving</p>
<p>occasional visits from him, and that not without peril after the</p>
<p>revival of persecution; while the congregations in London had the</p>
<p>benefit of his exhortations at stated intervals.  Almost the first</p>
<p>thing Bunyan did, after his liberation from gaol, was to make</p>
<p>others sharers in his hardly won &quot;liberty of prophesying,&quot; by</p>
<p>applying to the Government for licenses for preachers and preaching</p>
<p>places in Bedfordshire and the neighbouring counties, under the</p>
<p>Declaration of Indulgence.  The still existing list sent in to the</p>
<p>authorities by him, in his own handwriting, contains the names of</p>
<p>twenty-five preachers and thirty buildings, besides &quot;Josias</p>
<p>Roughead&#x27;s House in his orchard at Bedford.&quot;  Nineteen of these</p>
<p>were in his own native county, three in Northamptonshire, three in</p>
<p>Buckinghamshire, two in Cambridgeshire, two in Huntingdonshire, and</p>
<p>one in Hertfordshire.  The places sought to be licensed were very</p>
<p>various, barns, malthouses, halls belonging to public companies,</p>
<p>&amp;c., but more usually private houses.  Over these religious</p>
<p>communities, bound together by a common faith and common suffering,</p>
<p>Bunyan exercised a quasi-episcopal superintendence, which gained</p>
<p>for him the playful title of &quot;Bishop Bunyan.&quot;  In his regular</p>
<p>circuits, - &quot;visitations&quot; we may not improperly term them, - we are</p>
<p>told that he exerted himself to relieve the temporal wants of the</p>
<p>sufferers under the penal laws, - so soon and so cruelly revived, -</p>
<p>ministered diligently to the sick and afflicted, and used his</p>
<p>influence in reconciling differences between &quot;professors of the</p>
<p>gospel,&quot; and thus prevented the scandal of litigation among</p>
<p>Christians.  The closing period of Bunyan&#x27;s life was laborious but</p>
<p>happy, spent &quot;honourably and innocently&quot; in writing, preaching,</p>
<p>visiting his congregations, and planting daughter churches.</p>
<p>&quot;Happy,&quot; writes Mr. Froude, &quot;in his work; happy in the sense that</p>
<p>his influence was daily extending - spreading over his own country</p>
<p>and to the far-off settlements of America, - he spent his last</p>
<p>years in his own land of Beulah, Doubting Castle out of sight, and</p>
<p>the towers and minarets of Immanuel&#x27;s Land growing nearer and</p>
<p>clearer as the days went on.&quot;</p>
<p>With his time so largely occupied in his spiritual functions, he</p>
<p>could have had but small leisure to devote to his worldly calling.</p>
<p>This, however, one of so honest and independent a spirit is sure</p>
<p>not to have neglected, it was indeed necessary that to a certain</p>
<p>extent he should work for his living.  He had a family to maintain.</p>
<p>His congregation were mostly of the poorer sort, unable to</p>
<p>contribute much to their pastor&#x27;s support.  Had it been otherwise,</p>
<p>Bunyan was the last man in the world to make a trade of the gospel,</p>
<p>and though never hesitating to avail himself of the apostolic</p>
<p>privilege to &quot;live of the gospel,&quot; he, like the apostle of the</p>
<p>Gentiles, would never be ashamed to &quot;work with his own hands,&quot; that</p>
<p>he might &quot;minister to his own necessities,&quot; and those of his</p>
<p>family.  But from the time of his release he regarded his</p>
<p>ministerial work as the chief work of his life.  &quot;When he came</p>
<p>abroad,&quot; says one who knew him, &quot;he found his temporal affairs were</p>
<p>gone to wreck, and he had as to them to begin again as if he had</p>
<p>newly come into the world.  But yet he was not destitute of</p>
<p>friends, who had all along supported him with necessaries and had</p>
<p>been very good to his family, so that by their assistance getting</p>
<p>things a little about him again, he resolved as much as possible to</p>
<p>decline worldly business, and give himself wholly up to the service</p>
<p>of God.&quot;  The anonymous writer to whom we are indebted for</p>
<p>information concerning his imprisonment and his subsequent life,</p>
<p>says that Bunyan, &quot;contenting himself with that little God had</p>
<p>bestowed upon him, sequestered himself from all secular employments</p>
<p>to follow that of his call to the ministry.&quot;  The fact, however,</p>
<p>that in the &quot;deed of gift&quot; of all his property to his wife in 1685,</p>
<p>he still describes himself as a &quot;brazier,&quot; puts it beyond all doubt</p>
<p>that though his ministerial duties were his chief concern, he</p>
<p>prudently kept fast hold of his handicraft as a certain means of</p>
<p>support for himself and those dependent on him.  On the whole,</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s outward circumstances were probably easy.  His wants were</p>
<p>few and easily supplied.  &quot;Having food and raiment&quot; for himself,</p>
<p>his wife, and his children, he was &quot;therewith content.&quot;  The house</p>
<p>in the parish of St. Cuthbert&#x27;s which was his home from his release</p>
<p>to his death (unhappily demolished fifty years back), shows the</p>
<p>humble character of his daily life.  It was a small cottage, such</p>
<p>as labourers now occupy, with three small rooms on the ground</p>
<p>floor, and a garret with a diminutive dormer window under the high-</p>
<p>pitched tiled roof.  Behind stood an outbuilding which served as</p>
<p>his workshop.  We have a passing glimpse of this cottage home in</p>
<p>the diary of Thomas Hearne, the Oxford antiquary.  One Mr. Bagford,</p>
<p>otherwise unknown to us, had once &quot;walked into the country&quot; on</p>
<p>purpose to see &quot;the study of John Bunyan,&quot; and the student who made</p>
<p>it famous.  On his arrival the interviewer - as we should now call</p>
<p>him - met with a civil and courteous reception from Bunyan; but he</p>
<p>found the contents of his study hardly larger than those of his</p>
<p>prison cell.  They were limited to a Bible, and copies of &quot;The</p>
<p>Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress,&quot; and a few other books, chiefly his own works,</p>
<p>&quot;all lying on a shelf or shelves.&quot;  Slight as this sketch is, it</p>
<p>puts us more in touch with the immortal dreamer than many longer</p>
<p>and more elaborate paragraphs.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s celebrity as a preacher, great before he was shut up in</p>
<p>gaol, was naturally enhanced by the circumstance of his</p>
<p>imprisonment.  The barn in Josias Roughead&#x27;s orchard, where he was</p>
<p>licensed as a preacher, was &quot;so thronged the first time he appeared</p>
<p>there to edify, that many were constrained to stay without; every</p>
<p>one that was of his persuasion striving to partake of his</p>
<p>instructions.&quot;  Wherever he ministered, sometimes, when troublous</p>
<p>days returned, in woods, and in dells, and other hiding-places, the</p>
<p>announcement that John Bunyan was to preach gathered a large and</p>
<p>attentive auditory, hanging on his lips and drinking from them the</p>
<p>word of life.  His fame grew the more he was known and reached its</p>
<p>climax when his work was nearest its end.  His biographer Charles</p>
<p>Doe tells us that just before his death, &quot;when Mr. Bunyan preached</p>
<p>in London, if there were but one day&#x27;s notice given, there would be</p>
<p>more people come together than the meeting-house could hold.  I</p>
<p>have seen, by my computation, about twelve hundred at a morning</p>
<p>lecture by seven o&#x27;clock on a working day, in the dark winter time.</p>
<p>I also computed about three thousand that came to hear him one</p>
<p>Lord&#x27;s Day in London, at a town&#x27;s-end meeting-house, so that half</p>
<p>were fain to go back again for want of room, and then himself was</p>
<p>fain at a back door to be pulled almost over people to get upstairs</p>
<p>to his pulpit.&quot;  This &quot;town&#x27;s-end meeting house&quot; has been</p>
<p>identified by some with a quaint straggling long building which</p>
<p>once stood in Queen Street, Southwark, of which there is an</p>
<p>engraving in Wilkinson&#x27;s &quot;Londina Illustrata.&quot;  Doe&#x27;s account,</p>
<p>however, probably points to another building, as the Zoar Street</p>
<p>meeting-house was not opened for worship till about six months</p>
<p>before Bunyan&#x27;s death, and then for Presbyterian service.  Other</p>
<p>places in London connected with his preaching are Pinners&#x27; Hall in</p>
<p>Old Broad Street, where, on one of his occasional visits, he</p>
<p>delivered his striking sermon on &quot;The Greatness of the Soul and the</p>
<p>Unspeakableness of the Loss thereof,&quot; first published in 1683; and</p>
<p>Dr. Owen&#x27;s meeting-house in White&#x27;s Alley, Moorfields, which was</p>
<p>the gathering-place for titled folk, city merchants, and other</p>
<p>Nonconformists of position and degree.  At earlier times, when the</p>
<p>penal laws against Nonconformists were in vigorous exercise, Bunyan</p>
<p>had to hold his meetings by stealth in private houses and other</p>
<p>places where he might hope to escape the lynx-eyed informer.  It</p>
<p>was at one of these furtive meetings that his earliest biographer,</p>
<p>the honest combmaker at the foot of London Bridge, Charles Doe,</p>
<p>first heard him preach.  His choice of an Old Testament text at</p>
<p>first offended Doe, who had lately come into New Testament light</p>
<p>and had had enough of the &quot;historical and doing-for-favour of the</p>
<p>Old Testament.&quot;  But as he went on he preached &quot;so New Testament</p>
<p>like&quot; that his hearer&#x27;s prejudices vanished, and he could only</p>
<p>&quot;admire, weep for joy, and give the preacher his affections.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan was more than once urged to leave Bedford and settle in the</p>
<p>metropolis.  But to all these solicitations he turned a deaf ear.</p>
<p>Bedford was the home of his deepest affections.  It was there the</p>
<p>holy words of the poor women &quot;sitting in the sun,&quot; speaking &quot;as if</p>
<p>joy did make them speak,&quot; had first &quot;made his heart shake,&quot; and</p>
<p>shown him that he was still a stranger to vital godliness.  It was</p>
<p>there he had been brought out of darkness into light himself, and</p>
<p>there too he had been the means of imparting the same blessing to</p>
<p>others.  The very fact of his long imprisonment had identified him</p>
<p>with the town and its inhabitants.  There he had a large and loving</p>
<p>congregation, to whom he was bound by the ties of a common faith</p>
<p>and common sufferings.  Many of these recognized in Bunyan their</p>
<p>spiritual father; all, save a few &quot;of the baser sort,&quot; reverenced</p>
<p>him as their teacher and guide.  No prospect of a wider field of</p>
<p>usefulness, still less of a larger income, could tempt him to</p>
<p>desert his &quot;few sheep in the wilderness.&quot;  Some of them, it is</p>
<p>true, were wayward sheep, who wounded the heart of their pastor by</p>
<p>breaking from the fold, and displaying very un-lamb-like behaviour.</p>
<p>He had sometimes to realize painfully that no pale is so close but</p>
<p>that the enemy will creep in somewhere and seduce the flock; and</p>
<p>that no rules of communion, however strict, can effectually exclude</p>
<p>unworthy members.  Brother John Stanton had to be admonished &quot;for</p>
<p>abusing his wife and beating her often for very light matters&quot; (if</p>
<p>the matters had been less light, would the beating in these days</p>
<p>have been thought justifiable?); and Sister Mary Foskett, for</p>
<p>&quot;privately whispering of a horrid scandal, &#x27;without culler of</p>
<p>truth,&#x27; against Brother Honeylove.&quot;  Evil-speaking and backbiting</p>
<p>set brother against brother.  Dissensions and heartburnings grieved</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s spirit.  He himself was not always spared.  A letter had</p>
<p>to be written to Sister Hawthorn &quot;by way of reproof for her</p>
<p>unseemly language against Brother Scot and the whole Church.&quot;  John</p>
<p>Wildman was had up before the Church and convicted of being &quot;an</p>
<p>abominable liar and slanderer,&quot; &quot;extraordinary guilty&quot; against &quot;our</p>
<p>beloved Brother Bunyan himself.&quot;  And though Sister Hawthorn</p>
<p>satisfied the Church by &quot;humble acknowledgment of her miscariag,&quot;</p>
<p>the bolder misdoer only made matters worse by &quot;a frothy letter,&quot;</p>
<p>which left no alternative but a sentence of expulsion.  But though</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s flock contained some whose fleeces were not as white as he</p>
<p>desired, these were the exception.  The congregation meeting in</p>
<p>Josias Roughead&#x27;s barn must have been, take them as a whole, a</p>
<p>quiet, God-fearing, spiritually-minded folk, of whom their pastor</p>
<p>could think with thankfulness and satisfaction as &quot;his hope and joy</p>
<p>and crown of rejoicing.&quot;  From such he could not be severed</p>
<p>lightly.  Inducements which would have been powerful to a meaner</p>
<p>nature fell dead on his independent spirit.  He was not &quot;a man that</p>
<p>preached by way of bargain for money,&quot; and, writes Doe, &quot;more than</p>
<p>once he refused a more plentiful income to keep his station.&quot;  As</p>
<p>Dr. Brown says:  &quot;He was too deeply rooted on the scene of his</p>
<p>lifelong labours and sufferings to think of striking his tent till</p>
<p>the command came from the Master to come up to the higher service</p>
<p>for which he had been ripening so long.&quot;  At Bedford, therefore, he</p>
<p>remained; quietly staying on in his cottage in St. Cuthbert&#x27;s, and</p>
<p>ministering to his humble flock, loving and beloved, as Mr. Froude</p>
<p>writes, &quot;through changes of ministry, Popish plots, and Monmouth</p>
<p>rebellions, while the terror of a restoration of Popery was</p>
<p>bringing on the Revolution; careless of kings and cabinets, and</p>
<p>confident that Giant Pope had lost his power for harm, and</p>
<p>thenceforward could only bite his nails at the passing pilgrims.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s peace was not, however, altogether undisturbed.  Once it</p>
<p>received a shock in a renewal of his imprisonment, though only for</p>
<p>a brief period, in 1675, to which we owe the world-famous</p>
<p>&quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;; and it was again threatened, though not</p>
<p>actually disturbed ten years later, when the renewal of the</p>
<p>persecution of the Nonconformists induced him to make over all his</p>
<p>property - little enough in good sooth - to his wife by deed of</p>
<p>gift.</p>
<p>The former of these events demands our attention, not so much for</p>
<p>itself as for its connection with Bishop Barlow&#x27;s interference in</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s behalf, and, still more, for its results in the production</p>
<p>of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;  Until very recently the bare fact of</p>
<p>this later imprisonment, briefly mentioned by Charles Doe and</p>
<p>another of his early biographers, was all that was known to us.</p>
<p>They even leave the date to be gathered, though both agree in</p>
<p>limiting its duration to six months or thereabouts.  The recent</p>
<p>discovery, among the Chauncey papers, by Mr. W. G. Thorpe, of the</p>
<p>original warrant under which Bunyan was at this time sent to gaol,</p>
<p>supplies the missing information.  It has been already noticed that</p>
<p>the Declaration of Indulgence, under which Bunyan was liberated in</p>
<p>1672, was very short-lived.  Indeed it barely lasted in force a</p>
<p>twelvemonth.  Granted on the 15th of March of that year, it was</p>
<p>withdrawn on the 9th of March of the following year, at the</p>
<p>instance of the House of Commons, who had taken alarm at a</p>
<p>suspension of the laws of the realm by the &quot;inherent power&quot; of the</p>
<p>sovereign, without the advice or sanction of Parliament.  The</p>
<p>Declaration was cancelled by Charles II., the monarch, it is said,</p>
<p>tearing off the Great Seal with his own hands, a subsidy being</p>
<p>promised to the royal spendthrift as a reward for his complaisance.</p>
<p>The same year the Test Act became law.  Bunyan therefore and his</p>
<p>fellow Nonconformists were in a position of greater peril, as far</p>
<p>as the letter of the law was concerned, than they had ever been.</p>
<p>But, as Dr. Stoughton has remarked, &quot;the letter of the law is not</p>
<p>to be taken as an accurate index of the Nonconformists&#x27; condition.</p>
<p>The pressure of a bad law depends very much upon the hands employed</p>
<p>in its administration.&quot;  Unhappily for Bunyan, the parties in whose</p>
<p>hands the execution of the penal statutes against Nonconformists</p>
<p>rested in Bedfordshire were his bitter personal enemies, who were</p>
<p>not likely to let them lie inactive.  The prime mover in the matter</p>
<p>was doubtless Dr. William Foster, that &quot;right Judas&quot; whom we shall</p>
<p>remember holding the candle in Bunyan&#x27;s face in the hall of</p>
<p>Harlington House at his first apprehension, and showing such</p>
<p>feigned affection &quot;as if he would have leaped on his neck and</p>
<p>kissed him.&quot;  He had some time before this become Chancellor of the</p>
<p>Bishop of Lincoln, and Commissary of the Court of the Archdeacon of</p>
<p>Bedford, offices which put in his hands extensive powers which he</p>
<p>had used with the most relentless severity.  He has damned himself</p>
<p>to eternal infamy by the bitter zeal he showed in hunting down</p>
<p>Dissenters, inflicting exorbitant fines, and breaking into their</p>
<p>houses and distraining their goods for a full discharge,</p>
<p>maltreating their wives and daughters, and haling the offenders to</p>
<p>prison.  Having been chiefly instrumental in Bunyan&#x27;s first</p>
<p>committal to gaol, he doubtless viewed his release with indignation</p>
<p>as the leader of the Bedfordshire sectaries who was doing more</p>
<p>mischief to the cause of conformity, which it was his province at</p>
<p>all hazards to maintain, than any other twenty men.  The church</p>
<p>would never be safe till he was clapped in prison again.  The power</p>
<p>to do this was given by the new proclamation.  By this act the</p>
<p>licenses to preach previously granted to Nonconformists were</p>
<p>recalled.  Henceforward no conventicle had &quot;any authority,</p>
<p>allowance, or encouragement from his Majesty.&quot;  We can easily</p>
<p>imagine the delight with which Foster would hail the issue of this</p>
<p>proclamation.  How he would read and read again with ever fresh</p>
<p>satisfaction its stringent clauses.  That pestilent fellow, Bunyan,</p>
<p>was now once more in his clutches.  This time there was no chance</p>
<p>of his escape.  All licences were recalled, and he was absolutely</p>
<p>defenceless.  It should not be Foster&#x27;s fault if he failed to end</p>
<p>his days in the prison from which he ought never to have been</p>
<p>released.  The proclamation is dated the 4th of March, 1674-5, and</p>
<p>was published in the GAZETTE on the 9th.  It would reach Bedford on</p>
<p>the 11th.  It placed Bunyan at the mercy of &quot;his enemies, who</p>
<p>struck at him forthwith.&quot;  A warrant was issued for his</p>
<p>apprehension, undoubtedly written by our old friend, Paul Cobb, the</p>
<p>clerk of the peace, who, it will be remembered, had acted in the</p>
<p>same capacity on Bunyan&#x27;s first committal.  It is dated the 4th of</p>
<p>March, and bears the signature of no fewer than thirteen</p>
<p>magistrates, ten of them affixing their seals.</p>
<p>That so unusually large a number took part in the execution of this</p>
<p>warrant, is sufficient indication of the importance attached to</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s imprisonment by the gentry of the county.  The following</p>
<p>is the document:-</p>
<p>&quot;To the Constables of Bedford and to every of them</p>
<p>Whereas information and complaint is made unto us that</p>

<p>There would be little delay in the execution of the warrant.</p>
<p>John Bunyan was a marked man and an old offender, who, on his</p>
<p>arrest, would be immediately committed for trial.  Once more, then,</p>
<p>Bunyan became a prisoner, and that, there can be little doubt, in</p>
<p>his old quarters in the Bedford gaol.  Errors die hard, and those</p>
<p>by whom they have been once accepted find it difficult to give them</p>
<p>up.  The long-standing tradition of Bunyan&#x27;s twelve years&#x27;</p>
<p>imprisonment in the little lock-up-house on the Ouse bridge, having</p>
<p>been scattered to the winds by the logic of fact and common sense,</p>
<p>those to whom the story is dear, including the latest and ablest of</p>
<p>his biographers, Dr. Brown, see in this second brief imprisonment a</p>
<p>way to rehabilitate it.  Probability pointing to this imprisonment</p>
<p>as the time of the composition of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress,&quot; they</p>
<p>hold that on this occasion Bunyan was committed to the bridge-gaol,</p>
<p>and that he there wrote his immortal work, though they fail to</p>
<p>bring forward any satisfactory reasons for the change of the place</p>
<p>of his confinement.  The circumstances, however, being the same,</p>
<p>there can be no reasonable ground for questioning that, as before,</p>
<p>Bunyan was imprisoned in the county gaol.</p>
<p>This last imprisonment of Bunyan&#x27;s lasted only half as many months</p>
<p>as his former imprisonment had lasted years.  At the end of six</p>
<p>months he was again a free man.  His release was due to the good</p>
<p>officers of Owen, Cromwell&#x27;s celebrated chaplain, with Barlow,</p>
<p>Bishop of Lincoln.  The suspicion which hung over this intervention</p>
<p>from its being erroneously attributed to his release in 1672, three</p>
<p>years before Barlow became a bishop, has been dispelled by the</p>
<p>recently discovered warrant.  The dates and circumstances are now</p>
<p>found to tally.  The warrant for Bunyan&#x27;s apprehension bears date</p>
<p>March 4, 1675.  On the 14th of the following May the supple and</p>
<p>time-serving Barlow, after long and eager waiting for a mitre, was</p>
<p>elected to the see of Lincoln vacated by the death of Bishop</p>
<p>Fuller, and consecrated on the 27th of June.  Barlow, a man of very</p>
<p>dubious churchmanship, who had succeeded in keeping his university</p>
<p>appointments undisturbed all through the Commonwealth, and who was</p>
<p>yet among the first with effusive loyalty to welcome the</p>
<p>restoration of monarchy, had been Owen&#x27;s tutor at Oxford, and</p>
<p>continued to maintain friendly relations with him.  As bishop of</p>
<p>the diocese to which Bedfordshire then, and long after, belonged,</p>
<p>Barlow had the power, by the then existing law, of releasing a</p>
<p>prisoner for nonconformity on a bond given by two persons that he</p>
<p>would conform within half a year.  A friend of Bunyan&#x27;s, probably</p>
<p>Ichabod Chauncey, obtained a letter from Owen to the bishop</p>
<p>requesting him to employ this prerogative in Bunyan&#x27;s behalf.</p>
<p>Barlow with hollow complaisance expressed his particular kindness</p>
<p>for Dr. Owen, and his desire to deny him nothing he could legally</p>
<p>grant.  He would even strain a point to serve him.  But he had only</p>
<p>just been made a bishop, and what was asked was a new thing to him.</p>
<p>He desired a little time to consider of it.  If he could do it,</p>
<p>Owen might be assured of his readiness to oblige him.  A second</p>
<p>application at the end of a fortnight found this readiness much</p>
<p>cooled.  It was true that on inquiry he found he might do it; but</p>
<p>the times were critical, and he had many enemies.  It would be</p>
<p>safer for him not to take the initiative.  Let them apply to the</p>
<p>Lord Chancellor, and get him to issue an order for him to release</p>
<p>Bunyan on the customary bond.  Then he would do what Owen asked.</p>
<p>It was vain to tell Barlow that the way he suggested was</p>
<p>chargeable, and Bunyan poor.  Vain also to remind him that there</p>
<p>was no point to be strained.  He had satisfied himself that he</p>
<p>might do the thing legally.  It was hoped he would remember his</p>
<p>promise.  But the bishop would not budge from the position he had</p>
<p>taken up.  They had his ultimatum; with that they must be content.</p>
<p>If Bunyan was to be liberated, his friends must accept Barlow&#x27;s</p>
<p>terms.  &quot;This at last was done, and the poor man was released.  But</p>
<p>little thanks to the bishop.&quot;</p>
<p>This short six months&#x27; imprisonment assumes additional importance</p>
<p>from the probability, first suggested by Dr. Brown, which the</p>
<p>recovery of its date renders almost a certainty, that it was during</p>
<p>this period that Bunyan began, if he did not complete, the first</p>
<p>part of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;  We know from Bunyan&#x27;s own words</p>
<p>that the book was begun in gaol, and its composition has been</p>
<p>hitherto unhesitatingly assigned to his twelve years&#x27; confinement.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown was, we believe, the first to call this in question.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s imprisonment, we know, ended in 1672.  The first edition</p>
<p>of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; did not appear till 1678.  If written</p>
<p>during his earlier imprisonment, six years must have elapsed</p>
<p>between its writing and its publication.  But it was not Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>way to keep his works in manuscript so long after their completion.</p>
<p>His books were commonly put in the printers&#x27; hands as soon as they</p>
<p>were finished.  There are no sufficient reasons - though some have</p>
<p>been suggested - for his making an exception to this general habit</p>
<p>in the case of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;  Besides we should</p>
<p>certainly conclude, from the poetical introduction, that there was</p>
<p>little delay between the finishing of the book and its being given</p>
<p>to the world.  After having written the book, he tells us, simply</p>
<p>to gratify himself, spending only &quot;vacant seasons&quot; in his</p>
<p>&quot;scribble,&quot; to &quot;divert&quot; himself &quot;from worser thoughts,&quot; he showed</p>
<p>it to his friends to get their opinion whether it should be</p>
<p>published or not.  But as they were not all of one mind, but some</p>
<p>counselled one thing and some another, after some perplexity, he</p>
<p>took the matter into his own hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Now was I in a strait, and did not see</p>
<p>Which was the best thing to be done by me;</p>
<p>At last I thought, Since you are so divided,</p>
<p>I print it will, and so the case decided.&quot;</p>
<p>We must agree with Dr. Brown that &quot;there is a briskness about this</p>
<p>which, to say the least, is not suggestive of a six years&#x27; interval</p>
<p>before publication.&quot;  The break which occurs in the narrative after</p>
<p>the visit of the Pilgrims to the Delectable Mountains, which so</p>
<p>unnecessarily interrupts the course of the story - &quot;So I awoke from</p>
<p>my dream; and I slept and dreamed again&quot; - has been not</p>
<p>unreasonably thought by Dr. Brown to indicate the point Bunyan had</p>
<p>reached when his six months&#x27; imprisonment ended, and from which he</p>
<p>continued the book after his release.</p>
<p>The First Part of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; issued from the press in</p>
<ol start="1678">
<li>A second edition followed in the same year, and a third with</li>
</ol>
<p>large and important additions in 1679.  The Second Part, after an</p>
<p>interval of seven years, followed early in 1685.  Between the two</p>
<p>parts appeared two of his most celebrated works - the &quot;Life and</p>
<p>Death of Mr. Badman,&quot; published in 1680, originally intended to</p>
<p>supply a contrast and a foil to &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress,&quot; by</p>
<p>depicting a life which was scandalously bad; and, in 1682, that</p>
<p>which Macaulay, with perhaps exaggerated eulogy, has said, &quot;would</p>
<p>have been our greatest allegory if the earlier allegory had never</p>
<p>been written,&quot; the &quot;Holy War made by Shaddai upon Diabolus.&quot;</p>
<p>Superior to &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; as a literary composition,</p>
<p>this last work must be pronounced decidedly inferior to it in</p>
<p>attractive power.  For one who reads the &quot;Holy War,&quot; five hundred</p>
<p>read the &quot;Pilgrim.&quot;  And those who read it once return to it again</p>
<p>and again, with ever fresh delight.  It is a book that never tires.</p>
<p>One or two perusals of the &quot;Holy War&quot; satisfy:  and even these are</p>
<p>not without weariness.  As Mr. Froude has said, &quot;The &#x27;Holy War&#x27;</p>
<p>would have entitled Bunyan to a place among the masters of English</p>
<p>literature.  It would never have made his name a household word in</p>
<p>every English-speaking family on the globe.&quot;</p>
<p>Leaving the further notice of these and his other chief literary</p>
<p>productions to another chapter, there is little more to record in</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s life.  Though never again seriously troubled for his</p>
<p>nonconformity, his preaching journeys were not always without risk.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that when he visited Reading to preach, he</p>
<p>disguised himself as a waggoner carrying a long whip in his hand to</p>
<p>escape detection.  The name of &quot;Bunyan&#x27;s Dell,&quot; in a wood not very</p>
<p>far from Hitchin, tells of the time when he and his hearers had to</p>
<p>conceal their meetings from their enemies&#x27; quest, with scouts</p>
<p>planted on every side to warn them of the approach of the spies and</p>
<p>informers, who for reward were actively plying their odious trade.</p>
<p>Reference has already been made to Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;deed of gift&quot; of all</p>
<p>that he possessed in the world - his &quot;goods, chattels, debts, ready</p>
<p>money, plate, rings, household stuff, apparel, utensils, brass,</p>
<p>pewter, bedding, and all other his substance whatsoever - to his</p>
<p>well-beloved wife Elizabeth Bunyan.&quot;  Towards the close of the</p>
<p>first year of James the Second, 1685, the apprehensions under which</p>
<p>Bunyan executed this document were far from groundless.  At no time</p>
<p>did the persecution of Nonconformists rage with greater fierceness.</p>
<p>Never, not even under the tyranny of Laud, as Lord Macaulay records</p>
<p>had the condition of the Puritans been so deplorable.  Never had</p>
<p>spies been so actively employed in detecting congregations.  Never</p>
<p>had magistrates, grand-jurors, rectors, and churchwardens been so</p>
<p>much on the alert.  Many Nonconformists were cited before the</p>
<p>ecclesiastical courts.  Others found it necessary to purchase the</p>
<p>connivance of the agents of the Government by bribes.  It was</p>
<p>impossible for the sectaries to pray together without precautions</p>
<p>such as are employed by coiners and receivers of stolen goods.</p>
<p>Dissenting ministers, however blameless in life, however eminent in</p>
<p>learning, could not venture to walk the streets for fear of</p>
<p>outrages which were not only not repressed, but encouraged by those</p>
<p>whose duty it was to preserve the peace.  Richard Baxter was in</p>
<p>prison.  Howe was afraid to show himself in London for fear of</p>
<p>insult, and had been driven to Utrecht.  Not a few who up to that</p>
<p>time had borne up boldly lost heart and fled the kingdom.  Other</p>
<p>weaker spirits were terrified into a show of conformity.  Through</p>
<p>many subsequent years the autumn of 1685 was remembered as a time</p>
<p>of misery and terror.  There is, however, no indication of Bunyan</p>
<p>having been molested.  The &quot;deed of gift&quot; by which he sought to</p>
<p>avoid the confiscation of his goods was never called into exercise.</p>
<p>Indeed its very existence was forgotten by his wife in whose behalf</p>
<p>it had been executed.  Hidden away in a recess in his house in St.</p>
<p>Cuthbert&#x27;s, this interesting document was accidentally discovered</p>
<p>at the beginning of the present century, and is preserved among the</p>
<p>most valued treasures of the congregation which bears his name.</p>
<p>Quieter times for Nonconformists were however at hand.  Active</p>
<p>persecution was soon to cease for them, and happily never to be</p>
<p>renewed in England.  The autumn of 1685 showed the first</p>
<p>indications of a great turn of fortune, and before eighteen months</p>
<p>had elapsed, the intolerant king and the intolerant Church were</p>
<p>eagerly bidding against each other for the support of the party</p>
<p>which both had so deeply injured.  A new form of trial now awaited</p>
<p>the Nonconformists.  Peril to their personal liberty was succeeded</p>
<p>by a still greater peril to their honesty and consistency of</p>
<p>spirit.  James the Second, despairing of employing the Tories and</p>
<p>the Churchmen as his tools, turned, as his brother had turned</p>
<p>before him, to the Dissenters.  The snare was craftily baited with</p>
<p>a Declaration of Indulgence, by which the king, by his sole</p>
<p>authority, annulled a long series of statutes and suspended all</p>
<p>penal laws against Nonconformists of every sort.  These lately</p>
<p>political Pariahs now held the balance of power.  The future</p>
<p>fortunes of England depended mainly on the course they would adopt.</p>
<p>James was resolved to convert the House of Commons from a free</p>
<p>deliberative assembly into a body subservient to his wishes, and</p>
<p>ready to give parliamentary sanction to any edict he might issue.</p>
<p>To obtain this end the electors must be manipulated.  Leaving the</p>
<p>county constituencies to be dealt with by the lords-lieutenants,</p>
<p>half of whom preferred dismissal to carrying out the odious service</p>
<p>peremptorily demanded of them, James&#x27;s next concern was to</p>
<p>&quot;regulate&quot; the Corporations.  In those days of narrowly restricted</p>
<p>franchise, the municipalities virtually returned the town members.</p>
<p>To obtain an obedient parliament, he must secure a roll of electors</p>
<p>pledged to return the royal nominees.  A committee of seven privy</p>
<p>councillors, all Roman Catholics but the infamous Jeffreys,</p>
<p>presided over the business, with local sub-committees scattered</p>
<p>over the country to carry out the details.  Bedford was dealt with</p>
<p>in its turn.  Under James&#x27;s policy of courting the Puritans, the</p>
<p>leading Dissenters were the first persons to be approached.  Two</p>
<p>are specially named, a Mr. Margetts, formerly Judge-Advocate-</p>
<p>General of the Army under General Monk, and John Bunyan.  It is no</p>
<p>matter of surprise that Bunyan, who had been so severe a sufferer</p>
<p>under the old penal statutes, should desire their abrogation, and</p>
<p>express his readiness to &quot;steer his friends and followers&quot; to</p>
<p>support candidates who would pledge themselves to vote for their</p>
<p>repeal.  But no further would he go.  The Bedford Corporation was</p>
<p>&quot;regulated,&quot; which means that nearly the whole of its members were</p>
<p>removed and others substituted by royal order.  Of these new</p>
<p>members some six or seven were leading persons of Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>congregation.  But, with all his ardent desire for religious</p>
<p>liberty, Bunyan was too keen-witted not to see through James&#x27;s</p>
<p>policy, and too honest to give it any direct insidious support.</p>
<p>&quot;In vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird.&quot;  He clearly</p>
<p>saw that it was not for any love of the Dissenters that they were</p>
<p>so suddenly delivered from their persecutions, and placed on a kind</p>
<p>of equality with the Church.  The king&#x27;s object was the</p>
<p>establishment of Popery.  To this the Church was the chief</p>
<p>obstacle.  That must be undermined and subverted first.  That done,</p>
<p>all other religious denominations would follow.  All that the</p>
<p>Nonconformists would gain by yielding, was the favour Polyphemus</p>
<p>promised Ulysses, to be devoured last.  Zealous as he was for the</p>
<p>&quot;liberty of prophesying,&quot; even that might be purchased at too high</p>
<p>a price.  The boon offered by the king was &quot;good in itself,&quot; but</p>
<p>not &quot;so intended.&quot;  So, as his biographer describes, when the</p>
<p>regulators came, &quot;he expressed his zeal with some weariness as</p>
<p>perceiving the bad consequences that would ensue, and laboured with</p>
<p>his congregation&quot; to prevent their being imposed on by the fair</p>
<p>promises of those who were at heart the bitterest enemies of the</p>
<p>cause they professed to advocate.  The newly-modelled corporation</p>
<p>of Bedford seems like the other corporations through the country,</p>
<p>to have proved as unmanageable as the old.  As Macaulay says, &quot;The</p>
<p>sectaries who had declared in favour of the Indulgence had become</p>
<p>generally ashamed of their error, and were desirous to make</p>
<p>atonement.&quot;  Not knowing the man they had to deal with, the</p>
<p>&quot;regulators&quot; are said to have endeavoured to buy Bunyan&#x27;s support</p>
<p>by the offer of some place under government.  The bribe was</p>
<p>indignantly rejected.  Bunyan even refused to see the government</p>
<p>agent who offered it, - &quot;he would, by no means come to him, but</p>
<p>sent his excuse.&quot;  Behind the treacherous sunshine he saw a black</p>
<p>cloud, ready to break.  The Ninevites&#x27; remedy he felt was now</p>
<p>called for.  So he gathered his congregation together and appointed</p>
<p>a day of fasting and prayer to avert the danger that, under a</p>
<p>specious pretext, again menaced their civil and religious</p>
<p>liberties.  A true, sturdy Englishman, Bunyan, with Baxter and</p>
<p>Howe, &quot;refused an indulgence which could only be purchased by the</p>
<p>violent overthrow of the law.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan did not live to see the Revolution.  Four months after he</p>
<p>had witnessed the delirious joy which hailed the acquittal of the</p>
<p>seven bishops, the Pilgrim&#x27;s earthly Progress ended, and he was</p>
<p>bidden to cross the dark river which has no bridge.  The summons</p>
<p>came to him in the very midst of his religious activity, both as a</p>
<p>preacher and as a writer.  His pen had never been more busy than</p>
<p>when he was bidden to lay it down finally.  Early in 1688, after a</p>
<p>two years&#x27; silence, attributable perhaps to the political troubles</p>
<p>of the times, his &quot;Jerusalem Sinner Saved, or a Help to Despairing</p>
<p>Souls,&quot; one of the best known and most powerfully characteristic of</p>
<p>his works, had issued from the press, and had been followed by four</p>
<p>others between March and August, the month of his death.  These</p>
<p>books were, &quot;The Work of Jesus Christ as an Advocate;&quot; a poetical</p>
<p>composition entitled &quot;The Building, Nature, and Excellency of the</p>
<p>House of God,&quot; a discourse on the constitution and government of</p>
<p>the Christian Church; the &quot;Water of Life,&quot; and &quot;Solomon&#x27;s Temple</p>
<p>Spiritualized.&quot;  At the time of his death he was occupied in seeing</p>
<p>through the press a sixth book, &quot;The Acceptable Sacrifice,&quot; which</p>
<p>was published after his funeral.  In addition to these, Bunyan left</p>
<p>behind him no fewer than fourteen works in manuscript, written at</p>
<p>this time, as the fruit of his fertile imagination and untiring</p>
<p>pen.  Ten of these were given to the world soon after Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>death, by one of Bunyan&#x27;s most devoted followers, Charles Doe, the</p>
<p>combmaker of London Bridge (who naively tells us how one day</p>
<p>between the stairhead and the middle of the stairs, he resolved</p>
<p>that the best work he could do for God was to get Bunyan&#x27;s books</p>
<p>printed and sell them - adding, &quot;I have sold about 3,000&quot;), and</p>
<p>others, a few years later, including one of the raciest of his</p>
<p>compositions, &quot;The Heavenly Footman,&quot; bought by Doe of Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>eldest son, and, he says, &quot;put into the World in Print Word for</p>
<p>Word as it came from him to Me.&quot;</p>
<p>At the time that death surprised him, Bunyan had gained no small</p>
<p>celebrity in London as a popular preacher, and approached the</p>
<p>nearest to a position of worldly honour.  Though we must probably</p>
<p>reject the idea that he ever filled the office of Chaplain to the</p>
<p>Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Shorter, the fact that he is styled</p>
<p>&quot;his Lordship&#x27;s teacher&quot; proves that there was some relation more</p>
<p>than that of simple friendship between the chief magistrate and the</p>
<p>Bedford minister.  But the society of the great was never congenial</p>
<p>to him.  If they were godly as well as great, he would not shrink</p>
<p>from intercourse, with those of a rank above his own, but his heart</p>
<p>was with his own humble folk at Bedford.  Worldly advancement he</p>
<p>rejected for his family as well as for himself.  A London merchant,</p>
<p>it is said, offered to take his son Joseph into his house of</p>
<p>business without the customary premium.  But the offer was declined</p>
<p>with what we may consider an overstrained independence.  &quot;God,&quot; he</p>
<p>said, &quot;did not send me to advance my family but to preach the</p>
<p>gospel.&quot;  &quot;An instance of other-worldliness,&quot; writes Dr. Brown,</p>
<p>&quot;perhaps more consistent with the honour of the father than with</p>
<p>the prosperity of the son.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s end was in keeping with his life.  He had ever sought to</p>
<p>be a peacemaker and to reconcile differences, and thus had</p>
<p>&quot;hindered many mishaps and saved many families from ruin.&quot;  His</p>
<p>last effort of the kind caused his death.  The father of a young</p>
<p>man in whom he took an interest, had resolved, on some offence,</p>
<p>real or supposed, to disinherit his son.  The young man sought</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s mediation.  Anxious to heal the breach, Bunyan mounted his</p>
<p>horse and took the long journey to the father&#x27;s house at Reading -</p>
<p>the scene, as we have noticed, of his occasional ministrations -</p>
<p>where he pleaded the offender&#x27;s cause so effectually as to obtain a</p>
<p>promise of forgiveness.  Bunyan returned homewards through London,</p>
<p>where he was appointed to preach at Mr. Gamman&#x27;s meeting-house near</p>
<p>Whitechapel.  His forty miles&#x27; ride to London was through heavy</p>
<p>driving rain.  He was weary and drenched to the skin when he</p>
<p>reached the house of his &quot;very loving friend,&quot; John Strudwick,</p>
<p>grocer and chandler, at the sign of the Star, Holborn Bridge, at</p>
<p>the foot of Snow Hill, and deacon of the Nonconformist meeting in</p>
<p>Red Cross Street.  A few months before Bunyan had suffered from the</p>
<p>sweating sickness.  The exposure caused a return of the malady, and</p>
<p>though well enough to fulfil his pulpit engagement on Sunday, the</p>
<p>19th of August, on the following Tuesday dangerous symptoms</p>
<p>declared themselves, and in ten days the disease proved fatal.  He</p>
<p>died within two months of completing his sixtieth year, on the 31st</p>
<p>of August, 1688, just a month before the publication of the</p>
<p>Declaration of the Prince of Orange opened a new era of civil and</p>
<p>religious liberty, and between two and three months before the</p>
<p>Prince&#x27;s landing in Torbay.  He was buried in Mr. Strudwick&#x27;s</p>
<p>newly-purchased vault, in what Southey has termed the Campo Santo</p>
<p>of Nonconformists, the burial-ground in Finsbury, taking its name</p>
<p>of Bunhill or Bonehill Field, from a vast mass of human remains</p>
<p>removed to it from the charnel house of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in</p>
<ol start="1549">
<li>At a later period it served as a place of interment for</li>
</ol>
<p>those who died in the Great Plague of 1665.  The day after Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>funeral, his powerful friend, Sir John Shorter, the Lord Mayor, had</p>
<p>a fatal fall from his horse in Smithfield, and &quot;followed him across</p>
<p>the river.&quot;</p>
<p>By his first wife, whose Christian name is nowhere recorded, Bunyan</p>
<p>had four children - two sons and two daughters; and by his second</p>
<p>wife, the heroic Elizabeth, one son and one daughter.  All of these</p>
<p>survived him except his eldest daughter Mary, his tenderly-loved</p>
<p>blind child, who died before him.  His wife only survived him for a</p>
<p>brief period, &quot;following her faithful pilgrim from this world to</p>
<p>the other whither he was gone before her&quot; either in 1691 or 1692.</p>
<p>Forgetful of the &quot;deed of gift,&quot; or ignorant of its bearing,</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s widow took out letters of administration of her late</p>
<p>husband&#x27;s estate, which appears from the Register Book to have</p>
<p>amounted to no more than, 42 pounds 19s.  On this, and the proceeds</p>
<p>of his books, she supported herself till she rejoined him.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s character and person are thus described by Charles Doe:</p>
<p>&quot;He appeared in countenance to be of a stern and rough temper.  But</p>
<p>in his conversation he was mild and affable, not given to loquacity</p>
<p>or much discourse in company, unless some urgent occasion required</p>
<p>it.  Observing never to boast of himself or his parts, but rather</p>
<p>to seem low in his own eyes and submit himself to the judgment of</p>
<p>others.  Abhorring lying and swearing, being just, in all that lay</p>
<p>in his power, to his word.  Not seeming to revenge injuries; loving</p>
<p>to reconcile differences and make friendship with all.  He had a</p>
<p>sharp, quick eye, with an excellent discerning of persons, being of</p>
<p>good judgment and quick wit.  He was tall of stature, strong-boned,</p>
<p>though not corpulent; somewhat of a ruddy face, with sparkling</p>
<p>eyes, wearing his hair on his upper lip after the old British</p>
<p>fashion.  His hair reddish, but in his later days time had</p>
<p>sprinkled it with grey.  His nose well set, but not declining or</p>
<p>bending.  His mouth moderately large, his forehead something high,</p>
<p>and his habit always plain and modest.  Not puffed up in</p>
<p>prosperity, nor shaken in adversity, always holding the golden</p>
<p>mean.&quot;</p>
<p>We may add the portrait drawn by one who had been his companion and</p>
<p>fellow-sufferer for many years, John Nelson:  &quot;His countenance was</p>
<p>grave and sedate, and did so to the life discover the inward frame</p>
<p>of his heart, that it was convincing to the beholders and did</p>
<p>strike something of awe into them that had nothing of the fear of</p>
<p>God.&quot;</p>
<p>The same friend speaks thus of Bunyan&#x27;s preaching:  &quot;As a minister</p>
<p>of Christ he was laborious in his work of preaching, diligent in</p>
<p>his preparation for it, and faithful in dispensing the Word, not</p>
<p>sparing reproof whether in the pulpit or no, yet ready to succour</p>
<p>the tempted; a son of consolation to the broken-hearted, yet a son</p>
<p>of thunder to secure and dead sinners.  His memory was tenacious,</p>
<p>it being customary with him to commit his sermons to writing after</p>
<p>he had preached them.  A rich anointing of the Spirit was upon him,</p>
<p>yet this great saint was always in his own eyes the chiefest of</p>
<p>sinners and the least of saints.&quot;</p>
<p>An anecdote is told which, Southey says, &quot;authenticates itself,&quot;</p>
<p>that one day when he had preached &quot;with peculiar warmth and</p>
<p>enlargement,&quot; one of his hearers remarked &quot;what a sweet sermon he</p>
<p>had delivered.&quot;  &quot;Ay,&quot; was Bunyan&#x27;s reply, &quot;you have no need to</p>
<p>tell me that, for the devil whispered it to me before I was well</p>
<p>out of the pulpit.&quot;  As an evidence of the estimation in which</p>
<p>Bunyan was held by the highly-educated, it is recorded that Charles</p>
<p>the Second expressed his surprise to Dr. Owen that &quot;a learned man</p>
<p>such as he could sit and listen to an illiterate tinker.&quot;  &quot;May it</p>
<p>please your Majesty,&quot; Owen replied.  &quot;I would gladly give up all my</p>
<p>learning if I could preach like that tinker.&quot;</p>
<p>Although much of Bunyan&#x27;s literary activity was devoted to</p>
<p>controversy, he had none of the narrowness or bitter spirit of a</p>
<p>controversialist.  It is true that his zeal for what he deemed to</p>
<p>be truth led him into vehemence of language in dealing with those</p>
<p>whom he regarded as its perverters.  But this intensity of speech</p>
<p>was coupled with the utmost charity of spirit towards those who</p>
<p>differed from him.  Few ever had less of the sectarian temper which</p>
<p>lays greater stress on the infinitely small points on which all</p>
<p>true Christians differ than on the infinitely great truths on which</p>
<p>they are agreed.  Bunyan inherited from his spiritual father, John</p>
<p>Gifford, a truly catholic spirit.  External differences he regarded</p>
<p>as insignificant where he found real Christian faith and love.  &quot;I</p>
<p>would be,&quot; he writes, &quot;as I hope I am, a Christian.  But for those</p>
<p>factious titles of Anabaptist, Independent, Presbyterian, and the</p>
<p>like, I conclude that they come neither from Jerusalem nor from</p>
<p>Antioch, but from Hell or from Babylon.&quot;  &quot;He was,&quot; writes one of</p>
<p>his early biographers, &quot;a true lover of all that love our Lord</p>
<p>Jesus, and did often bewail the different and distinguishing</p>
<p>appellations that are among the godly, saying he did believe a time</p>
<p>would come when they should be all buried.&quot;  The only persons he</p>
<p>scrupled to hold communion with were those whose lives were openly</p>
<p>immoral.  &quot;Divisions about non-essentials,&quot; he said, &quot;were to</p>
<p>churches what wars were to countries.  Those who talked most about</p>
<p>religion cared least for it; and controversies about doubtful</p>
<p>things and things of little moment, ate up all zeal for things</p>
<p>which were practical and indisputable.&quot;  His last sermon breathed</p>
<p>the same catholic spirit, free from the trammels of narrow</p>
<p>sectarianism.  &quot;If you are the children of God live together</p>
<p>lovingly.  If the world quarrel with you it is no matter; but it is</p>
<p>sad if you quarrel together.  If this be among you it is a sign of</p>
<p>ill-breeding.  Dost thou see a soul that has the image of God in</p>
<p>him?  Love him, love him.  Say, &#x27;This man and I must go to heaven</p>
<p>one day.&#x27;  Serve one another.  Do good for one another.  If any</p>
<p>wrong you pray to God to right you, and love the brotherhood.&quot;  The</p>
<p>closing words of this his final testimony are such as deserve to be</p>
<p>written in letters of gold as the sum of all true Christian</p>
<p>teaching:  &quot;Be ye holy in all manner of conversation:  Consider</p>
<p>that the holy God is your Father, and let this oblige you to live</p>
<p>like the children of God, that you may look your Father in the face</p>
<p>with comfort another day.&quot;  &quot;There is,&quot; writes Dean Stanley, &quot;no</p>
<p>compromise in his words, no faltering in his convictions; but his</p>
<p>love and admiration are reserved on the whole for that which all</p>
<p>good men love, and his detestation on the whole is reserved for</p>
<p>that which all good men detest.&quot;  By the catholic spirit which</p>
<p>breathes through his writings, especially through &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>Progress,&quot; the tinker of Elstow &quot;has become the teacher not of any</p>
<p>particular sect, but of the Universal Church.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<p>We have, in this concluding chapter, to take a review of Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>merits as a writer, with especial reference to the works on which</p>
<p>his fame mainly rests, and, above all, to that which has given him</p>
<p>his chief title to be included in a series of Great Writers, &quot;The</p>
<p>Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;  Bunyan, as we have seen, was a very copious</p>
<p>author.  His works, as collected by the late industrious Mr. Offor,</p>
<p>fill three bulky quarto volumes, each of nearly eight hundred</p>
<p>double-columned pages in small type.  And this copiousness of</p>
<p>production is combined with a general excellence in the matter</p>
<p>produced.  While few of his books approach the high standard of</p>
<p>&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; or &quot;Holy War,&quot; none, it may be truly said,</p>
<p>sink very far below that standard.  It may indeed be affirmed that</p>
<p>it was impossible for Bunyan to write badly.  His genius was a</p>
<p>native genius.  As soon as he began to write at all, he wrote well.</p>
<p>Without any training, is he says, in the school of Aristotle or</p>
<p>Plato, or any study of the great masters of literature, at one</p>
<p>bound he leapt to a high level of thought and composition.  His</p>
<p>earliest book, &quot;Some Gospel Truths Opened,&quot; &quot;thrown off,&quot; writes</p>
<p>Dr. Brown, &quot;at a heat,&quot; displays the same ease of style and</p>
<p>directness of speech and absence of stilted phraseology which he</p>
<p>maintained to the end.  The great charm which pervades all Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>writings is their naturalness.  You never feel that he is writing</p>
<p>for effect, still less to perform an uncongenial piece of task-</p>
<p>work.  He writes because he had something to say which was worth</p>
<p>saying, a message to deliver on which the highest interests of</p>
<p>others were at stake, which demanded nothing more than a</p>
<p>straightforward earnestness and plainness of speech, such as coming</p>
<p>from the heart might best reach the hearts of others.  He wrote as</p>
<p>he spoke, because a necessity was laid upon him which he dared not</p>
<p>evade.  As he says in a passage quoted in a former chapter, he</p>
<p>might have stepped into a much higher style, and have employed more</p>
<p>literary ornament.  But to attempt this would be, to one of his</p>
<p>intense earnestness, to degrade his calling.  He dared not do it.</p>
<p>Like the great Apostle, &quot;his speech and preaching was not with</p>
<p>enticing words of man&#x27;s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit</p>
<p>and in power.&quot;  God had not played with him, and he dared not play</p>
<p>with others.  His errand was much too serious, and their need and</p>
<p>danger too urgent to waste time in tricking out his words with</p>
<p>human skill.  And it is just this which, with all their rudeness,</p>
<p>their occasional bad grammar, and homely colloquialisms, gives to</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s writings a power of riveting the attention and stirring</p>
<p>the affections which few writers have attained to.  The pent-up</p>
<p>fire glows in every line, and kindles the hearts of his readers.</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful images, vivid expressions, forcible arguments all aglow</p>
<p>with passion, tender pleadings, solemn warnings, make those who</p>
<p>read him all eye, all ear, all soul.&quot;  This native vigour is</p>
<p>attributable, in no small degree, to the manner in which for the</p>
<p>most part Bunyan&#x27;s works came into being.  He did not set himself</p>
<p>to compose theological treatises upon stated subjects, but after he</p>
<p>had preached with satisfaction to himself and acceptance with his</p>
<p>audience, he usually wrote out the substance of his discourse from</p>
<p>memory, with the enlargements and additions it might seem to</p>
<p>require.  And thus his religious works have all the glow and</p>
<p>fervour of the unwritten utterances of a practised orator, united</p>
<p>with the orderliness and precision of a theologian, and are no less</p>
<p>admirable for the excellence of their arrangement than for their</p>
<p>evangelical spirit and scriptural doctrine.  Originally meant to be</p>
<p>heard, they lose somewhat by being read.  But few can read them</p>
<p>without being delighted with the opulence of his imagination and</p>
<p>impressed with the solemn earnestness of his convictions.  Like the</p>
<p>subject of the portrait described by him in the House of the</p>
<p>Interpreter, he stands &quot;like one who pleads with men, the law of</p>
<p>truth written upon his lips, the world behind his back, and a crown</p>
<p>of gold above his head.&quot;</p>
<p>These characteristics, which distinguish Bunyan as a writer from</p>
<p>most of his Puritan contemporaries, are most conspicuous in the</p>
<p>works by which he is chiefly known, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress,&quot; the</p>
<p>&quot;Holy War,&quot; the &quot;Grace Abounding,&quot; and we may add, though from the</p>
<p>repulsiveness of the subject the book is now scarcely read at all,</p>
<p>the &quot;Life and Death of Mr. Badman.&quot;</p>
<p>One great charm of these works, especially of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>Progress,&quot; lies in the pure Saxon English in which they are</p>
<p>written, which render them models of the English speech, plain but</p>
<p>never vulgar, homely but never coarse, and still less unclean, full</p>
<p>of imagery but never obscure, always intelligible, always forcible,</p>
<p>going straight to the point in the fewest and simplest words;</p>
<p>&quot;powerful and picturesque,&quot; writes Hallam, &quot;from concise</p>
<p>simplicity.&quot;  Bunyan&#x27;s style is recommended by Lord Macaulay as an</p>
<p>invaluable study to every person who wishes to gain a wide command</p>
<p>over his mother tongue.  Its vocabulary is the vocabulary of the</p>
<p>common people.  &quot;There is not,&quot; he truly says, &quot;in &#x27;The Pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>Progress&#x27; a single expression, if we except a few technical terms</p>
<p>of theology, that would puzzle the rudest peasant.&quot;  We may, look</p>
<p>through whole pages, and not find a word of more than two</p>
<p>syllables.  Nor is the source of this pellucid clearness and</p>
<p>imaginative power far to seek.  Bunyan was essentially a man of one</p>
<p>book, and that book the very best, not only for its spiritual</p>
<p>teaching but for the purity of its style, the English Bible.  &quot;In</p>
<p>no book,&quot; writes Mr. J. R. Green, &quot;do we see more clearly than in</p>
<p>&#x27;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&#x27; the new imaginative force which had been</p>
<p>given to the common life of Englishmen by their study of the Bible.</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s English is the simplest and homeliest English that has</p>
<p>ever been used by any great English writer, but it is the English</p>
<p>of the Bible.  His images are the images of prophet and evangelist.</p>
<p>So completely had the Bible become Bunyan&#x27;s life that one feels its</p>
<p>phrases as the natural expression of his thoughts.  He had lived in</p>
<p>the Bible till its words became his own.&quot;</p>
<p>All who have undertaken to take an estimate of Bunyan&#x27;s literary</p>
<p>genius call special attention to the richness of his imaginative</p>
<p>power.  Few writers indeed have possessed this power in so high a</p>
<p>degree.  In nothing, perhaps, is its vividness more displayed than</p>
<p>in the reality of its impersonations.  The DRAMATIS PERSONS are not</p>
<p>shadowy abstractions, moving far above us in a mystical world, or</p>
<p>lay figures ticketed with certain names, but solid men and women of</p>
<p>our own flesh and blood, living in our own everyday world, and of</p>
<p>like passions with ourselves.  Many of them we know familiarly;</p>
<p>there is hardly one we should be surprised to meet any day.  This</p>
<p>life-like power of characterization belongs in the highest degree</p>
<p>to &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;  It is hardly inferior in &quot;The Holy</p>
<p>War,&quot; though with some exceptions the people of &quot;Mansoul&quot; have</p>
<p>failed to engrave themselves on the popular memory as the</p>
<p>characters of the earlier allegory have done.  The secret of this</p>
<p>graphic power, which gives &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; its universal</p>
<p>popularity, is that Bunyan describes men and women of his own day,</p>
<p>such as he had known and seen them.  They are not fancy pictures,</p>
<p>but literal portraits.  Though the features may be exaggerated, and</p>
<p>the colours laid on with an unsparing brush, the outlines of his</p>
<p>bold personifications are truthfully drawn from his own experience.</p>
<p>He had had to do with every one of them.  He could have given a</p>
<p>personal name to most of them, and we could do the same to many.</p>
<p>We are not unacquainted with Mr Byends of the town of Fair Speech,</p>
<p>who &quot;always has the luck to jump in his judgment with the way of</p>
<p>the times, and to get thereby,&quot; who is zealous for Religion &quot;when</p>
<p>he goes in his silver slippers,&quot; and &quot;loves to walk with him in the</p>
<p>streets when the sun shines and the people applaud him.&quot;  All his</p>
<p>kindred and surroundings are only too familiar to us - his wife,</p>
<p>that very virtuous woman my Lady Feigning&#x27;s daughter, my Lord Fair-</p>
<p>speech, my Lord Time-server, Mr. Facingbothways, Mr. Anything, and</p>
<p>the Parson of the Parish, his mother&#x27;s own brother by the father&#x27;s</p>
<p>side, Mr. Twotongues.  Nor is his schoolmaster, one Mr. Gripeman,</p>
<p>of the market town of Lovegain, in the county of Coveting, a</p>
<p>stranger to us.  Obstinate, with his dogged determination and</p>
<p>stubborn common-sense, and Pliable with his shallow</p>
<p>impressionableness, are among our acquaintances.  We have, before</p>
<p>now, come across &quot;the brisk lad Ignorance from the town of</p>
<p>Conceit,&quot; and have made acquaintance with Mercy&#x27;s would-be suitor,</p>
<p>Mr. Brisk, &quot;a man of some breeding and that pretended to religion,</p>
<p>but who stuck very close to the world.&quot;  The man Temporary who</p>
<p>lived in a town two miles off from Honesty, and next door to Mr.</p>
<p>Turnback; Formalist and Hypocrisy, who were &quot;from the land of</p>
<p>Vainglory, and were going for praise to Mount Sion&quot;; Simple, Sloth,</p>
<p>and Presumption, &quot;fast asleep by the roadside with fetters on their</p>
<p>heels,&quot; and their companions, Shortwind, Noheart, Lingerafterlust,</p>
<p>and Sleepyhead, we know them all.  &quot;The young woman whose name was</p>
<p>Dull&quot; taxes our patience every day.  Where is the town which does</p>
<p>not contain Mrs. Timorous and her coterie of gossips, Mrs. Bats-</p>
<p>eyes, Mrs. Inconsiderate, Mrs. Lightmind, and Mrs. Knownothing,</p>
<p>&quot;all as merry as the maids,&quot; with that pretty fellow Mr. Lechery at</p>
<p>the house of Madam Wanton, that &quot;admirably well-bred gentlewoman&quot;?</p>
<p>Where shall we find more lifelike portraits than those of Madam</p>
<p>Bubble, a &quot;tall, comely dame, somewhat of a swarthy complexion,</p>
<p>speaking very smoothly with a smile at the end of each sentence,</p>
<p>wearing a great purse by her side, with her hand often in it,</p>
<p>fingering her money as if that was her chief delight;&quot; of poor</p>
<p>Feeblemind of the town of Uncertain, with his &quot;whitely look, the</p>
<p>cast in his eye, and his trembling speech;&quot; of Littlefaith, as</p>
<p>&quot;white as a clout,&quot; neither able to fight nor fly when the thieves</p>
<p>from Dead Man&#x27;s Lane were on him; of Ready-to-halt, at first coming</p>
<p>along on his crutches, and then when Giant Despair had been slain</p>
<p>and Doubting Castle demolished, taking Despondency&#x27;s daughter</p>
<p>Muchafraid by the hand and dancing with her in the road?  &quot;True, he</p>
<p>could not dance without one crutch in his hand, but I promise you</p>
<p>he footed it well.  Also the girl was to be commanded, for she</p>
<p>answered the musick handsomely.&quot;  In Bunyan&#x27;s pictures there is</p>
<p>never a superfluous detail.  Every stroke tells, and helps to the</p>
<p>completeness of the portraiture.</p>
<p>The same reality characterizes the descriptive part of &quot;The</p>
<p>Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;  As his characters are such as he must meet</p>
<p>with every day in his native town, so also the scenery and</p>
<p>surroundings of his allegory are part of his own every-day life,</p>
<p>and reproduce what he had been brought up amidst in his native</p>
<p>county, or had noticed in his tinker&#x27;s wanderings.  &quot;Born and</p>
<p>bred,&quot; writes Kingsley, &quot;in the monotonous Midland, he had no</p>
<p>natural images beyond the pastures and brooks, the town and country</p>
<p>houses, he saw about him.&quot;  The Slough of Despond, with its</p>
<p>treacherous quagmire in the midst of the plain, into which a</p>
<p>wayfarer might heedlessly fall, with its stepping-stones half</p>
<p>drowned in mire; Byepathmeadow, promising so fair, with its stile</p>
<p>and footpath on the other side of the fence; the pleasant river</p>
<p>fringed with meadows, green all the year long and overshadowed with</p>
<p>trees; the thicket all overgrown with briars and thorns, where one</p>
<p>tumbled over a bush, another stuck fast in the dirt, some lost</p>
<p>their shoes in the mire, and others were fastened from behind with</p>
<p>the brambles; the high wall by the roadside over which the fruit</p>
<p>trees shot their boughs and tempted the boys with their unripe</p>
<p>plums; the arbour with its settle tempting the footsore traveller</p>
<p>to drowsiness; the refreshing spring at the bottom of Hill</p>
<p>Difficulty; all are evidently drawn from his own experience.</p>
<p>Bunyan, in his long tramps, had seen them all.  He had known what</p>
<p>it was to be in danger of falling into a pit and being dashed to</p>
<p>pieces with Vain Confidence, of being drowned in the flooded</p>
<p>meadows with Christian and Hopeful; of sinking in deep water when</p>
<p>swimming over a river, going down and rising up half dead, and</p>
<p>needing all his companion&#x27;s strength and skill to keep his head</p>
<p>above the stream.  Vanity Fair is evidently drawn from the life.</p>
<p>The great yearly fair of Stourbridge, close to Cambridge, which</p>
<p>Bunyan had probably often visited in his tinker days, with its</p>
<p>streets of booths filled with &quot;wares of all kinds from all</p>
<p>countries,&quot; its &quot;shows, jugglings, cheats games, plays, fools,</p>
<p>apes, knaves, and rogues, and that of every kind,&quot; its &quot;great one</p>
<p>of the fair,&quot; its court of justice and power of judgment, furnished</p>
<p>him with the materials for his picture.  Scenes like these he draws</p>
<p>with sharp defined outlines.  When he had to describe what he only</p>
<p>knew by hearsay, his pictures are shadowy and cold.  Never having</p>
<p>been very far from home, he had had no experience of the higher</p>
<p>types of beauty and grandeur in nature, and his pen moves in</p>
<p>fetters when he attempts to describe them.  When his pilgrims come</p>
<p>to the Hill Difficulty and the Delectable Mountains, the difference</p>
<p>is at once seen.  All his nobler imagery is drawn from Scripture.</p>
<p>As Hallam has remarked, &quot;There is scarcely a circumstance or</p>
<p>metaphor in the Old Testament which does not find a place bodily</p>
<p>and literally in &#x27;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress,&#x27; and this has made his</p>
<p>imagination appear more creative than it really is.&quot;</p>
<p>It would but weary the reader to follow the details of a narrative</p>
<p>which is so universally known.  Who needs to be told that in the</p>
<p>pilgrimage here described is represented in allegorical dress the</p>
<p>course of a human soul convinced of sin, struggling onwards to</p>
<p>salvation through the trials and temptations that beset its path to</p>
<p>its eternal home?  The book is so completely wrought into the mind</p>
<p>and memory, that most of us can at once recall the incidents which</p>
<p>chequer the pilgrim&#x27;s way, and realize their meaning; the Slough of</p>
<p>Despond, in which the man convinced of his guilt and fleeing from</p>
<p>the wrath to come, in his agonizing self-consciousness is in danger</p>
<p>of being swallowed up in despair; the Wicket Gate, by which he</p>
<p>enters on the strait and narrow way of holiness; the Interpreter&#x27;s</p>
<p>House, with his visions and acted parables; the Wayside Cross, at</p>
<p>the sight of which the burden of guilt falls from the pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>back, and he is clothed with change of raiment; the Hill</p>
<p>Difficulty, which stands right in his way, and which he must</p>
<p>surmount, not circumvent; the lions which he has to pass, not</p>
<p>knowing that they are chained; the Palace Beautiful, where he is</p>
<p>admitted to the communion of the faithful, and sits down to meat</p>
<p>with them; the Valley of Humiliation, the scene of his desperate</p>
<p>but victorious encounter with Apollyon; the Valley of the Shadow of</p>
<p>Death, with its evil sights and doleful sounds, where one of the</p>
<p>wicked ones whispers into his ear thoughts of blasphemy which he</p>
<p>cannot distinguish from the suggestions of his own mind; the cave</p>
<p>at the valley&#x27;s mouth, in which, Giant Pagan having been dead this</p>
<p>many a day, his brother, Giant Pope, now sits alone, grinning at</p>
<p>pilgrims as they pass by, and biting his nails because he cannot</p>
<p>get at them; Vanity Fair, the picture of the world, as St. John</p>
<p>describes it, hating the light that puts to shame its own self-</p>
<p>chosen darkness, and putting it out if it can, where the Pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>fellow, Faithful, seals his testimony with his death, and the</p>
<p>Pilgrim himself barely escapes; the &quot;delicate plain&quot; called Ease,</p>
<p>and the little hill, Lucre, where Demas stood &quot;gentlemanlike,&quot; to</p>
<p>invite the passersby to come and dig in his silver mine; Byepath</p>
<p>Meadow, into which the Pilgrim and his newly-found companion stray,</p>
<p>and are made prisoners by Giant Despair and shut up in the dungeons</p>
<p>of Doubting Castle, and break out of prison by the help of the Key</p>
<p>of Promise; the Delectable Mountains in Immanuel&#x27;s Land, with their</p>
<p>friendly shepherds and the cheering prospect of the far-off</p>
<p>heavenly city; the Enchanted Land, with its temptations to</p>
<p>spiritual drowsiness at the very end of the journey; the Land of</p>
<p>Beulah, the ante-chamber of the city to which they were bound; and,</p>
<p>last stage of all, the deep dark river, without a bridge, which had</p>
<p>to be crossed before the city was entered; the entrance into its</p>
<p>heavenly gates, the pilgrim&#x27;s joyous reception with all the bells</p>
<p>in the city ringing again for joy; the Dreamer&#x27;s glimpse of its</p>
<p>glories through the opened portals - is not every stage of the</p>
<p>journey, every scene of the pilgrimage, indelibly printed on our</p>
<p>memories, for our warning, our instruction, our encouragement in</p>
<p>the race we, as much as they, have each one to run?  Have we not</p>
<p>all, again and again, shared the Dreamer&#x27;s feelings - &quot;After that</p>
<p>they shut up the Gates; which, when I had seen, I wished myself</p>
<p>among them,&quot; and prayed, God helping us, that our &quot;dangerous</p>
<p>journey&quot; - ever the most dangerous when we see its dangers the</p>
<p>least - might end in our &quot;safe arrival at the desired country&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; exhibits Bunyan in the character by which</p>
<p>he would have most desired to be remembered, as one of the most</p>
<p>influential of Christian preachers.  Hallam, however, claims for</p>
<p>him another distinction which would have greatly startled and</p>
<p>probably shocked him, as the father of our English novelists.  As</p>
<p>an allegorist Bunyan had many predecessors, not a few of whom,</p>
<p>dating from early times, had taken the natural allegory of the</p>
<p>pilgrimage of human life as the basis of their works.  But as a</p>
<p>novelist he had no one to show him the way.  Bunyan was the first</p>
<p>to break ground in a field which has since then been so</p>
<p>overabundantly worked that the soil has almost lost its</p>
<p>productiveness; while few novels written purely with the object of</p>
<p>entertainment have ever proved so universally entertaining.</p>
<p>Intensely religious as it is in purpose, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;</p>
<p>may be safely styled the first English novel.  &quot;The claim to be the</p>
<p>father of English romance,&quot; writes Dr. Allon, &quot;which has been</p>
<p>sometimes preferred for Defoe, really pertains to Bunyan.  Defoe</p>
<p>may claim the parentage of a species, but Bunyan is the creator of</p>
<p>the genus.&quot;  As the parent of fictitious biography it is that</p>
<p>Bunyan has charmed the world.  On its vivid interest as a story,</p>
<p>its universal interest and lasting vitality rest.  &quot;Other</p>
<p>allegorises,&quot; writes Lord Macaulay, &quot;have shown great ingenuity,</p>
<p>but no other allegorist has ever been able to touch the heart, and</p>
<p>to make its abstractions objects of terror, of pity, and of love.&quot;</p>
<p>Whatever its deficiencies, literary and religious, may be; if we</p>
<p>find incongruities in the narrative, and are not insensible to some</p>
<p>grave theological deficiencies; if we are unable without</p>
<p>qualification to accept Coleridge&#x27;s dictum that it is &quot;incomparably</p>
<p>the best &#x27;Summa Theologiae Evangelicae&#x27; ever produced by a writer</p>
<p>not miraculously inspired;&quot; even if, with Hallam, we consider its</p>
<p>&quot;excellencies great indeed, but not of the highest order,&quot; and deem</p>
<p>it &quot;a little over-praised,&quot; the fact of its universal popularity</p>
<p>with readers of all classes and of all orders of intellect remains,</p>
<p>and gives this book a unique distinction.  &quot;I have,&quot; says Dr.</p>
<p>Arnold, when reading it after a long interval, &quot;always been struck</p>
<p>by its piety.  I am now struck equally or even more by its profound</p>
<p>wisdom.  It seems to be a complete reflexion of Scripture.&quot;  And to</p>
<p>turn to a critic of very different character, Dean Swift:  &quot;I have</p>
<p>been better entertained and more improved,&quot; writes that cynical</p>
<p>pessimist, &quot;by a few pages of this book than by a long discourse on</p>
<p>the will and intellect.&quot;  The favourite of our childhood, as &quot;the</p>
<p>most perfect and complex of fairy tales, so human and</p>
<p>intelligible,&quot; read, as Hallam says, &quot;at an age when the spiritual</p>
<p>meaning is either little perceived or little regarded,&quot; the</p>
<p>&quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; becomes the chosen companion of our later</p>
<p>years, perused with ever fresh appreciation of its teaching, and</p>
<p>enjoyment of its native genius; &quot;the interpreter of life to all who</p>
<p>are perplexed with its problems, and the practical guide and solace</p>
<p>of all who need counsel and sympathy.&quot;</p>
<p>The secret of this universal acceptableness of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s</p>
<p>Progress&quot; lies in the breadth of its religious sympathies.  Rigid</p>
<p>Puritan as Bunyan was, no book is more completely free from</p>
<p>sectarian narrowness.  Its reach is as wide as Christianity itself,</p>
<p>and it takes hold of every human heart because it is so intensely</p>
<p>human.  No apology is needed for presenting Mr. Froude&#x27;s eloquent</p>
<p>panegyric:  &quot;The Pilgrim, though in Puritan dress, is a genuine</p>
<p>man.  His experience is so truly human experience that Christians</p>
<p>of every persuasion can identify themselves with him; and even</p>
<p>those who regard Christianity itself as but a natural outgrowth of</p>
<p>the conscience and intellect, and yet desire to live nobly and make</p>
<p>the best of themselves, can recognize familiar footprints in every</p>
<p>step of Christian&#x27;s journey.  Thus &#x27;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&#x27; is a</p>
<p>book which when once read can never be forgotten.  We too, every</p>
<p>one of us, are pilgrims on the same road; and images and</p>
<p>illustrations come back to us from so faithful an itinerary, as we</p>
<p>encounter similar trials, and learn for ourselves the accuracy with</p>
<p>which Bunyan has described them.  Time cannot impair its interest,</p>
<p>or intellectual progress make it cease to be true to experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Dr. Brown&#x27;s appreciative words may be added:  &quot;With deepest pathos</p>
<p>it enters into the stern battle so real to all of us, into those</p>
<p>heart-experiences which make up, for all, the discipline of life.</p>
<p>It is this especially which has given to it the mighty hold which</p>
<p>it has always had upon the toiling poor, and made it the one book</p>
<p>above all books well-thumbed and torn to tatters among them.  And</p>
<p>it is this which makes it one of the first books translated by the</p>
<p>missionary who seeks to give true thoughts of God and life to</p>
<p>heathen men.&quot;</p>
<p>The Second Part of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; partakes of the</p>
<p>character of almost all continuations.  It is, in Mr. Froude&#x27;s</p>
<p>words, &quot;only a feeble reverberation of the first part, which has</p>
<p>given it a popularity it would have hardly attained by its own</p>
<p>merits.  Christiana and her children are tolerated for the</p>
<p>pilgrim&#x27;s sake to whom they belong.&quot;  Bunyan seems not to have been</p>
<p>insensible of this himself, when in his metrical preface he thus</p>
<p>introduces his new work:</p>
<p>&quot;Go now my little book to every place</p>
<p>Where my first Pilgrim has but shown his face.</p>
<p>Call at their door; if any say &#x27;Who&#x27;s there?&#x27;</p>
<p>Then answer thus, &#x27;Christiana is here.&#x27;</p>
<p>If they bid thee come in, then enter thou</p>
<p>With all thy boys.  And then, as thou know&#x27;st how,</p>
<p>Tell who they are, also from whence they came;</p>
<p>Perhaps they&#x27;ll know them by their looks or name.&quot;</p>
<p>But although the Second Part must be pronounced inferior, on the</p>
<p>whole, to the first, it is a work of striking individuality and</p>
<p>graphic power, such as Bunyan alone could have written.  Everywhere</p>
<p>we find strokes of his peculiar genius, and though in a smaller</p>
<p>measure than the first, it has added not a few portraits to</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s spiritual picture gallery we should be sorry to miss, and</p>
<p>supplied us with racy sayings which stick to the memory.  The sweet</p>
<p>maid Mercy affords a lovely picture of gentle feminine piety, well</p>
<p>contrasted with the more vigorous but still thoroughly womanly</p>
<p>character of Christiana.  Great-Heart is too much of an</p>
<p>abstraction:  a preacher in the uncongenial disguise of a knightly</p>
<p>champion of distressed females and the slayer of giants.  But the</p>
<p>other new characters have generally a vivid personality.  Who can</p>
<p>forget Old Honesty, the dull good man with no mental gifts but of</p>
<p>dogged sincerity, who though coming from the Town of Stupidity,</p>
<p>four degrees beyond the City of Destruction, was &quot;known for a cock</p>
<p>of the right kind,&quot; because he said the truth and stuck to it; or</p>
<p>his companion, Mr. Fearing, that most troublesome of pilgrims,</p>
<p>stumbling at every straw, lying roaring at the Slough of Despond</p>
<p>above a month together, standing shaking and shrinking at the</p>
<p>Wicket Gate, but making no stick at the Lions, and at last getting</p>
<p>over the river not much above wetshod; or Mr. Valiant for Truth,</p>
<p>the native of Darkland, standing with his sword drawn and his face</p>
<p>all bloody from his three hours&#x27; fight with Wildhead,</p>
<p>Inconsiderate, and Pragmatick; Mr. Standfast, blushing to be found</p>
<p>on his knees in the Enchanted Ground, one who loved to hear his</p>
<p>Lord spoken of, and coveted to set his foot wherever he saw the</p>
<p>print of his shoe; Mr. Feeblemind, the sickly, melancholy pilgrim,</p>
<p>at whose door death did usually knock once a day, betaking himself</p>
<p>to a pilgrim&#x27;s life because he was never well at home, resolved to</p>
<p>run when he could, and go when he could not run, and creep when he</p>
<p>could not go, an enemy to laughter and to gay attire, bringing up</p>
<p>the rear of the company with Mr. Readytohalt hobbling along on his</p>
<p>crutches; Giant Despair&#x27;s prisoners, Mr. Despondency, whom he had</p>
<p>all but starved to death - and Mistress Much-afraid his daughter,</p>
<p>who went through the river singing, though none could understand</p>
<p>what she said?  Each of these characters has a distinct</p>
<p>individuality which lifts them from shadowy abstractions into</p>
<p>living men and women.  But with all its excellencies, and they are</p>
<p>many, the general inferiority of the history of Christiana and her</p>
<p>children&#x27;s pilgrimage to that of her husband&#x27;s must be</p>
<p>acknowledged.  The story is less skilfully constructed; the</p>
<p>interest is sometimes allowed to flag; the dialogues that interrupt</p>
<p>the narrative are in places dry and wearisome - too much of sermons</p>
<p>in disguise.  There is also a want of keeping between the two parts</p>
<p>of the allegory.  The Wicket Gate of the First Part has become a</p>
<p>considerable building with a summer parlour in the Second; the</p>
<p>shepherds&#x27; tents on the Delectable Mountains have risen into a</p>
<p>palace, with a dining-room, and a looking-glass, and a store of</p>
<p>jewels; while Vanity Fair has lost its former bad character, and</p>
<p>has become a respectable country town, where Christiana and her</p>
<p>family, seeming altogether to forget their pilgrimage, settled down</p>
<p>comfortably, enjoy the society of the good people of the place, and</p>
<p>the sons marry and have children.  These same children also cause</p>
<p>the reader no little perplexity, when he finds them in the course</p>
<p>of the supposed journey transformed from sweet babes who are</p>
<p>terrified with the Mastiffs barking at the Wicket Gate, who catch</p>
<p>at the boughs for the unripe plums and cry at having to climb the</p>
<p>hill; whose faces are stroked by the Interpreter; who are</p>
<p>catechised and called &quot;good boys&quot; by Prudence; who sup on bread</p>
<p>crumbled into basins of milk, and are put to bed by Mercy - into</p>
<p>strong young men, able to go out and fight with a giant, and lend a</p>
<p>hand to the pulling down of Doubting Castle, and becoming husbands</p>
<p>and fathers.  We cannot but feel the want of VRAISEMBLANCE which</p>
<p>brings the whole company of pilgrims to the banks of the dark river</p>
<p>at one time, and sends them over in succession, following one</p>
<p>another rapidly through the Golden Gate of the City.  The four boys</p>
<p>with their wives and children, it is true, stay behind awhile, but</p>
<p>there is an evident incongruity in their doing so when the allegory</p>
<p>has brought them all to what stands for the close of their earthly</p>
<p>pilgrimage.  Bunyan&#x27;s mistake was in gratifying his inventive</p>
<p>genius and making his band of pilgrims so large.  He could get them</p>
<p>together and make them travel in company without any sacrifice of</p>
<p>dramatic truth, which, however, he was forced to disregard when the</p>
<p>time came for their dismissal.  The exquisite pathos of the</p>
<p>description of the passage of the river by Christian and Hopeful</p>
<p>blinds us to what may be almost termed the impossibility of two</p>
<p>persons passing through the final struggle together, and dying at</p>
<p>the same moment, but this charm is wanting in the prosaic picture</p>
<p>of the company of fellow-travellers coming down to the water&#x27;s</p>
<p>edge, and waiting till the postman blows his horn and bids them</p>
<p>cross.  Much as the Second Part contains of what is admirable, and</p>
<p>what no one but Bunyan could have written, we feel after reading it</p>
<p>that, in Mr. Froude&#x27;s words, the rough simplicity is gone, and has</p>
<p>been replaced by a tone of sentiment which is almost mawkish.</p>
<p>&quot;Giants, dragons, and angelic champions carry us into a spurious</p>
<p>fairyland where the knight-errant is a preacher in disguise.  Fair</p>
<p>ladies and love-matches, however decorously chastened, suit ill</p>
<p>with the sternness of the mortal conflict between the soul and</p>
<p>sin.&quot;  With the acknowledged shortcomings of the Second Part of</p>
<p>&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress,&quot; we may be well content that Bunyan never</p>
<p>carried out the idea hinted at in the closing words of his</p>
<p>allegory:  &quot;Shall it be my lot to go that way again, I may give</p>
<p>those that desire it an account of what I am here silent about; in</p>
<p>the meantime I bid my reader - Adieu.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan&#x27;s second great allegorical work, &quot;The Holy War,&quot; need not</p>
<p>detain us long.  Being an attempt, and in the nature of things an</p>
<p>unsuccessful attempt, to clothe what writers on divinity call &quot;the</p>
<p>plan of salvation&quot; in a figurative dress, the narrative, with all</p>
<p>its vividness of description in parts, its clearly drawn characters</p>
<p>with their picturesque nomenclature, and the stirring vicissitudes</p>
<p>of the drama, is necessarily wanting in the personal interest which</p>
<p>attaches to an individual man, like Christian, and those who are</p>
<p>linked with or follow his career.  In fact, the tremendous</p>
<p>realities of the spiritual history of the human race are entirely</p>
<p>unfit for allegorical treatment as a whole.  Sin, its origin, its</p>
<p>consequences, its remedy, and the apparent failure of that remedy</p>
<p>though administered by Almighty hands, must remain a mystery for</p>
<p>all time.  The attempts made by Bunyan, and by one of much higher</p>
<p>intellectual power and greater poetic gifts than Bunyan - John</p>
<p>Milton - to bring that mystery within the grasp of the finite</p>
<p>intellect, only render it more perplexing.  The proverbial line</p>
<p>tells us that -</p>
<p>&quot;Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.&quot;</p>
<p>Bunyan and Milton were as far as possible from being &quot;fools&quot;; but</p>
<p>when both these great writers, on the one hand, carry us up into</p>
<p>the Council Chamber of Heaven and introduce us to the Persons of</p>
<p>the ever-blessed Trinity, debating, consulting, planning, and</p>
<p>resolving, like a sovereign and his ministers when a revolted</p>
<p>province has to be brought back to its allegiance; and, on the</p>
<p>other hand, take us down to the infernal regions, and makes us</p>
<p>privy to the plots and counterplots of the rebel leaders and</p>
<p>hearers of their speeches, we cannot but feel that, in spite of the</p>
<p>magnificent diction and poetic imagination of the one, and the</p>
<p>homely picturesque genius of the other, the grand themes treated of</p>
<p>are degraded if not vulgarized, without our being in any way helped</p>
<p>to unravel their essential mysteries.  In point of individual</p>
<p>personal interest, &quot;The Holy War&quot; contrasts badly with &quot;The</p>
<p>Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;  The narrative moves in a more shadowy region.</p>
<p>We may admire the workmanship; but the same undefined sense of</p>
<p>unreality pursues us through Milton&#x27;s noble epic, the outcome of a</p>
<p>divinely-fired genius, and Bunyan&#x27;s humble narrative, drawing its</p>
<p>scenes and circumstances, and to some extent its DRAMATIS PERSONAE,</p>
<p>from the writer&#x27;s own surroundings in the town and corporation of</p>
<p>Bedford, and his brief but stirring experience as a soldier in the</p>
<p>great Parliamentary War.  The catastrophe also is eminently</p>
<p>unsatisfactory.  When Christian and Hopeful enter the Golden Gates</p>
<p>we feel that the story has come to its proper end, which we have</p>
<p>been looking for all along.  But the conclusion of &quot;The Holy War&quot;</p>
<p>is too much like the closing chapter of &quot;Rasselas&quot; - &quot;a conclusion</p>
<p>in which nothing is concluded.&quot;  After all the endless vicissitudes</p>
<p>of the conflict, and the final and glorious victory of Emmanuel and</p>
<p>his forces, and the execution of the ringleaders of the mutiny, the</p>
<p>issue still remains doubtful.  The town of Mansoul is left open to</p>
<p>fresh attacks.  Diabolus is still at large.  Carnal Sense breaks</p>
<p>prison and continues to lurk in the town.  Unbelief, that &quot;nimble</p>
<p>Jack,&quot; slips away, and can never be laid hold of.  These,</p>
<p>therefore, and some few others of the more subtle of the</p>
<p>Diabolonians, continue to make their home in Mansoul, and will do</p>
<p>so until Mansoul ceases to dwell in the kingdom of Universe.  It is</p>
<p>true they turn chicken-hearted after the other leaders of their</p>
<p>party have been taken and executed, and keep themselves quiet and</p>
<p>close, lurking in dens and holes lest they should be snapped up by</p>
<p>Emmanuel&#x27;s men.  If Unbelief or any of his crew venture to show</p>
<p>themselves in the streets, the whole town is up in arms against</p>
<p>them; the very children raise a hue and cry against them and seek</p>
<p>to stone them.  But all in vain.  Mansoul, it is true, enjoys some</p>
<p>good degree of peace and quiet.  Her Prince takes up his residence</p>
<p>in her borders.  Her captains and soldiers do their duties.  She</p>
<p>minds her trade with the heavenly land afar off; also she is busy</p>
<p>in her manufacture.  But with the remnants of the Diabolonians</p>
<p>still within her walls, ready to show their heads on the least</p>
<p>relaxation of strict watchfulness, keeping up constant</p>
<p>communication with Diabolus and the other lords of the pit, and</p>
<p>prepared to open the gates to them when opportunity offers, this</p>
<p>peace can not be lasting.  The old battle will have to be fought</p>
<p>over again, only to end in the same undecisive result.  And so it</p>
<p>must be to the end.  If untrue to art, Bunyan is true to fact.</p>
<p>Whether we regard Mansoul as the soul of a single individual or as</p>
<p>the whole human race, no final victory can be looked for so long as</p>
<p>it abides in &quot;the country of Universe.&quot;  The flesh will lust</p>
<p>against the spirit, the regenerated man will be in danger of being</p>
<p>brought into captivity to the law of sin and death unless he keeps</p>
<p>up his watchfulness and maintains the struggle to the end.</p>
<p>And it is here, that, for purposes of art, not for purposes of</p>
<p>truth, the real failing of &quot;The Holy War&quot; lies.  The drama of</p>
<p>Mansoul is incomplete, and whether individually or collectively,</p>
<p>must remain incomplete till man puts on a new nature, and the</p>
<p>victory, once for all gained on Calvary, is consummated, in the</p>
<p>fulness of time, at the restitution of all things.  There is no</p>
<p>uncertainty what the end will be.  Evil must be put down, and good</p>
<p>must triumph at last.  But the end is not yet, and it seems as far</p>
<p>off as ever.  The army of Doubters, under their several captains,</p>
<p>Election Doubters, Vocation Doubters, Salvation Doubters, Grace</p>
<p>Doubters, with their general the great Lord Incredulity at their</p>
<p>head, reinforced by many fresh regiments under novel standards,</p>
<p>unknown and unthought of in Bunyan&#x27;s days, taking the place of</p>
<p>those whose power is past, is ever making new attacks upon poor</p>
<p>Mansoul, and terrifying feeble souls with their threatenings.</p>
<p>Whichever way we look there is much to puzzle, much to grieve over,</p>
<p>much that to our present limited view is entirely inexplicable.</p>
<p>But the mind that accepts the loving will and wisdom of God as the</p>
<p>law of the Universe, can rest in the calm assurance that all,</p>
<p>however mysteriously, is fulfilling His eternal designs, and that</p>
<p>though He seems to permit &quot;His work to be spoilt, His power defied,</p>
<p>and even His victories when won made useless,&quot; it is but seeming, -</p>
<p>that the triumph of evil is but temporary, and that these apparent</p>
<p>failures and contradictions, are slowly but surely working out and</p>
<p>helping forward</p>
<p>&quot;The one unseen divine event</p>
<p>To which the whole creation moves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The mysteries and contradictions which the Christian revelation</p>
<p>leaves unsolved are made tolerable by Hope.&quot;  To adopt Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>figurative language in the closing paragraph of his allegory, the</p>
<p>day is certainly coming when the famous town of Mansoul shall be</p>
<p>taken down and transported &quot;every stick and stone&quot; to Emmanuel&#x27;s</p>
<p>land, and there set up for the Father&#x27;s habitation in such strength</p>
<p>and glory as it never saw before.  No Diabolonian shall be able to</p>
<p>creep into its streets, burrow in its walls, or be seen in its</p>
<p>borders.  No evil tidings shall trouble its inhabitants, nor sound</p>
<p>of Diabolian drum be heard there.  Sorrow and grief shall be ended,</p>
<p>and life, always sweet, always new, shall last longer than they</p>
<p>could even desire it, even all the days of eternity.  Meanwhile let</p>
<p>those who have such a glorious hope set before them keep clean and</p>
<p>white the liveries their Lord has given them, and wash often in the</p>
<p>open fountain.  Let them believe in His love, live upon His word;</p>
<p>watch, fight, and pray, and hold fast till He come.</p>
<p>One more work of Bunyan&#x27;s still remains to be briefly noticed, as</p>
<p>bearing the characteristic stamp of his genius, &quot;The Life and Death</p>
<p>of Mr. Badman.&quot;  The original idea of this book was to furnish a</p>
<p>contrast to &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;  As in that work he had</p>
<p>described the course of a man setting out on his course</p>
<p>heavenwards, struggling onwards through temptation, trials, and</p>
<p>difficulties, and entering at last through the golden gates into</p>
<p>the city of God, so in this later work his purpose was to depict</p>
<p>the career of a man whose face from the first was turned in the</p>
<p>opposite direction, going on from bad to worse, ever becoming more</p>
<p>and more irretrievably evil, fitter and fitter for the bottomless</p>
<p>pit; his life full of sin and his death without repentance; reaping</p>
<p>the fruit of his sins in hopeless sinfulness.  That this was the</p>
<p>original purpose of the work, Bunyan tells us in his preface.  It</p>
<p>came into his mind, he says, as in the former book he had written</p>
<p>concerning the progress of the Pilgrim from this world to glory, so</p>
<p>in this second book to write of the life and death of the ungodly,</p>
<p>and of their travel from this world to hell.  The new work,</p>
<p>however, as in almost every respect it differs from the earlier</p>
<p>one, so it is decidedly inferior to it.  It is totally unlike &quot;The</p>
<p>Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; both in form and execution.  The one is an</p>
<p>allegory, the other a tale, describing without imagery or metaphor,</p>
<p>in the plainest language, the career of a &quot;vulgar, middle-class,</p>
<p>unprincipled scoundrel.&quot;  While &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; pursues</p>
<p>the narrative form throughout, only interrupted by dialogues</p>
<p>between the leading characters, &quot;Mr. Badman&#x27;s career&quot; is presented</p>
<p>to the world in a dialogue between a certain Mr. Wiseman and Mr.</p>
<p>Attentive.  Mr. Wiseman tells the story, and Mr. Attentive supplies</p>
<p>appropriate reflections on it.  The narrative is needlessly</p>
<p>burdened with a succession of short sermons, in the form of</p>
<p>didactic discourses on lying, stealing, impurity, and the other</p>
<p>vices of which the hero of the story was guilty, and which brought</p>
<p>him to his miserable end.  The plainness of speech with which some</p>
<p>of these evil doings are enlarged upon, and Mr. Badman&#x27;s indulgence</p>
<p>in them described, makes portions of the book very disagreeable,</p>
<p>and indeed hardly profitable reading.  With omissions, however, the</p>
<p>book well deserves perusal, as a picture such as only Bunyan or his</p>
<p>rival in lifelike portraiture, Defoe, could have drawn of vulgar</p>
<p>English life in the latter part of the seventeenth century, in a</p>
<p>commonplace country town such as Bedford.  It is not at all a</p>
<p>pleasant picture.  The life described, when not gross, is sordid</p>
<p>and foul, is mean and commonplace.  But as a description of English</p>
<p>middle-class life at the epoch of the Restoration and Revolution,</p>
<p>it is invaluable for those who wish to put themselves in touch with</p>
<p>that period.  The anecdotes introduced to illustrate Bunyan&#x27;s</p>
<p>positions of God&#x27;s judgment upon swearers and sinners, convicting</p>
<p>him of a credulity and a harshness of feeling one is sorry to think</p>
<p>him capable of, are very interesting for the side-lights they throw</p>
<p>upon the times and the people who lived in them.  It would take too</p>
<p>long to give a sketch of the story, even if a summary could give</p>
<p>any real estimate of its picturesque and vivid power.  It is</p>
<p>certainly a remarkable, if an offensive book.  As with &quot;Robinson</p>
<p>Crusoe&quot; and Defoe&#x27;s other tales, we can hardly believe that we have</p>
<p>not a real history before us.  We feel that there is no reason why</p>
<p>the events recorded should not have happened.  There are no</p>
<p>surprises; no unlooked-for catastrophes; no providential</p>
<p>interpositions to punish the sinner or rescue the good man.</p>
<p>Badman&#x27;s pious wife is made to pay the penalty of allowing herself</p>
<p>to be deceived by a tall, good-looking, hypocritical scoundrel.  He</p>
<p>himself pursues his evil way to the end, and &quot;dies like a lamb, or</p>
<p>as men call it, like a Chrisom child sweetly and without fear,&quot; but</p>
<p>the selfsame Mr. Badman still, not only in name, but in condition;</p>
<p>sinning onto the last, and dying with a heart that cannot repent.</p>
<p>Mr. Froude&#x27;s summing up of this book is so masterly that we make no</p>
<p>apology for presenting it to our readers.  &quot;Bunyan conceals</p>
<p>nothing, assumes nothing, and exaggerates nothing.  He makes his</p>
<p>bad man sharp and shrewd.  He allows sharpness and shrewdness to</p>
<p>bring him the reward which such qualities in fact command.  Badman</p>
<p>is successful; is powerful; he enjoys all the pleasures which money</p>
<p>can bring; his bad wife helps him to ruin, but otherwise he is not</p>
<p>unhappy, and he dies in peace.  Bunyan has made him a brute,</p>
<p>because such men do become brutes.  It is the real punishment of</p>
<p>brutal and selfish habits.  There the figure stands - a picture of</p>
<p>a man in the rank of English life with which Bunyan was most</p>
<p>familiar; travelling along the primrose path to the everlasting</p>
<p>bonfire, as the way to Emmanuel&#x27;s Land was through the Slough of</p>
<p>Despond and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.  Pleasures are to be</p>
<p>found among the primroses, such pleasures as a brute can be</p>
<p>gratified by.  Yet the reader feels that even if there was no</p>
<p>bonfire, he would still prefer to be with Christian.&quot;</p>
