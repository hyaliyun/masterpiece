<p>THE MIDNIGHT QUEEN,</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<p>THE SORCERESS.</p>
<p>The plague raged in the city of London.  The destroying angel had</p>
<p>gone forth, and kindled with its fiery breath the awful</p>
<p>pestilence, until all London became one mighty lazar-house.</p>
<p>Thousands were swept away daily; grass grew in the streets, and</p>
<p>the living were scarce able to bury the dead.  Business of all</p>
<p>kinds was at an end, except that of the coffin-makers and drivers</p>
<p>of the pest-carte.  Whole streets were shut up, and almost every</p>
<p>other house in the city bore the fatal red cross, and the ominous</p>
<p>inscription.  &quot;Lord have mercy on us.&quot;  Few people, save the</p>
<p>watchmen, armed with halberts, keeping guard over the stricken</p>
<p>houses, appeared in the streets; and those who ventured there,</p>
<p>shrank from each other, and passed rapidly on with averted faces.</p>
<p>Many even fell dead on the sidewalk, and lay with their ghastly,</p>
<p>discolored faces, upturned to the mocking sunlight, until the</p>
<p>dead-cart came rattling along, and the drivers hoisted the body</p>
<p>with their pitchforks on the top of their dreadful load.  Few</p>
<p>other vehicles besides those same dead-carts appeared in the city</p>
<p>now; and they plied their trade busily, day and night; and the</p>
<p>cry of the drivers echoed dismally through the deserted streets:</p>
<p>&quot;Bring out your dead! bring out your dead!&quot;   All who could do so</p>
<p>had long ago fled from the devoted city; and London lay under the</p>
<p>burning heat of the June sunshine, stricken for its sins by the</p>
<p>hand of God.  The pest-houses were full, so were the plague-pits,</p>
<p>where the dead were hurled in cartfuls; and no one knew who rose</p>
<p>up in health in the morning but that they might be lying stark</p>
<p>and dead in a few hours.  The very churches were forsaken; their</p>
<p>pastors fled or lying in the plague-pits; and it was even</p>
<p>resolved to convert the great cathedral of St. Paul into a vast</p>
<p>plague-hospital.  Cries and lamentations echoed from one end of</p>
<p>the city to the other, and Death and Charles reigned over London</p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>Yet in the midst of all this, many scenes of wild orgies and</p>
<p>debauchery still went on within its gates - as, in our own day,</p>
<p>when the cholera ravaged Paris, the inhabitants of that facetious</p>
<p>city made it a carnival, so now, in London, they were many who,</p>
<p>feeling they had but a few days to live at the most, resolved to</p>
<p>defy death, and indulge in the revelry while they yet existed.</p>
<p>&quot;Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow you die!&quot; was their</p>
<p>motto; and if in the midst of the frantic dance or debauched</p>
<p>revel one of them dropped dead, the others only shrieked with</p>
<p>laughter, hurled the livid body out to the street, and the</p>
<p>demoniac mirth grew twice as fast and furious as before.  Robbers</p>
<p>and cut-purses paraded the streets at noonday, entered boldly</p>
<p>closed and deserted houses, and bore off with impunity, whatever</p>
<p>they pleased.  Highwaymen infested Hounslow Heath, and all the</p>
<p>roads leading from the city, levying a toll on all who passed,</p>
<p>and plundering fearlessly the flying citizens.  In fact,</p>
<p>far-famed London town, in the year of grace 1665, would have</p>
<p>given one a good idea of Pandemonium broke loose.</p>
<p>It was drawing to the close of an almost tropical June day, that</p>
<p>the crowd who had thronged the precincts of St. Paul&#x27;s since</p>
<p>early morning, began to disperse.  The sun, that had throbbed the</p>
<p>livelong day like a great heart of fire in a sea of brass, was</p>
<p>sinking from sight in clouds of crimson, purple and gold, yet</p>
<p>Paul&#x27;s Walk was crowded.  There were court-gallants in ruffles</p>
<p>and plumes; ballad-singers chanting the not over-delicate ditties</p>
<p>of the Earl of Rochester; usurers exchanging gold for bonds worth</p>
<p>three times what they gave for them; quack-doctors reading in</p>
<p>dolorous tones the bills of mortality of the preceding day, and</p>
<p>selling plague-waters and anti-pestilential abominations, whose</p>
<p>merit they loudly extolled; ladies too, richly dressed, and many</p>
<p>of them masked; and booksellers who always made St. Paul&#x27;s a</p>
<p>favorite haunt, and even to this day patronize its precincts, and</p>
<p>flourish in the regions of Paternoster Row and Ave Maria Lane;</p>
<p>court pages in rich liveries, pert and flippant; serving-men out</p>
<p>of place, and pickpockets with a keen eye to business; all</p>
<p>clashed and jostled together, raising a din to which the Plain of</p>
<p>Shinar, with its confusion of tongues and Babylonish workmen,</p>
<p>were as nothing.</p>
<p>Moving serenely through this discordant sea of his fellow-</p>
<p>creatures came a young man booted and spurred, whose rich doublet</p>
<p>of cherry colored velvet, edged and spangled with gold, and</p>
<p>jaunty hat set slightly on one side of his head, with its long</p>
<p>black plume and diamond clasp, proclaimed him to be somebody.  A</p>
<p>profusion of snowy shirt-frill rushed impetuously out of his</p>
<p>doublet; a black-velvet cloak, lined with amber-satin, fell</p>
<p>picturesquely from his shoulders; a sword with a jeweled hilt</p>
<p>clanked on the pavement as he walked.  One hand was covered with</p>
<p>a gauntlet of canary-colored kid, perfumed to a degree that would</p>
<p>shame any belle of to-day, the other, which rested lightly on his</p>
<p>sword-hilt, flashed with a splendid opal, splendidly set.  He was</p>
<p>a handsome fellow too, with fair waving hair (for he had the good</p>
<p>taste to discard the ugly wigs then in vogue), dark, bright,</p>
<p>handsome eyes, a thick blonde moustache, a tall and remarkably</p>
<p>graceful figure, and an expression of countenance wherein easy</p>
<p>good-nature and fiery impetuosity had a hard struggle for</p>
<p>mastery.  That he was a courtier of rank, was apparent from his</p>
<p>rich attire and rather aristocratic bearing and a crowd of</p>
<p>hangers-on followed him as he went, loudly demanding spur-money.</p>
<p>A group of timbril-girls, singing shrilly the songs of the day,</p>
<p>called boldly to him as he passed; and one of them, more free and</p>
<p>easy than the rest, danced up to him striking her timbrel, and</p>
<p>shouting rather than singing the chorus of the then popular ditty</p>

<p>The darling in question turned his bright blue eyes on that</p>
<p>dashing street-singer with a cool glance of recognition.</p>
<p>&quot;Very sorry, Nell,&quot; he said, in a nonchalant tone, &quot;but I&#x27;m</p>
<p>afraid I must.  How long have you been here, may I ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A full hour by St. Paul&#x27;s; and where has Sir Norman Kingsley</p>
<p>been, may I ask?  I thought you were dead of the plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not exactly.  Have you seen - ah! there he is.  The very man I</p>
<p>want.&quot;</p>
<p>With which Sir Norman Kingsley dropped a gold piece into the</p>
<p>girl&#x27;s extended palm, and pushed on through the crowd up Paul&#x27;s</p>
<p>Walk.  A tall, dark figure was leaning moodily with folded arms,</p>
<p>looking fixedly at the ground, and taking no notice of the busy</p>
<p>scene around him until Sir Norman laid his ungloved and jeweled</p>
<p>hand lightly on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning, Ormiston.  I had an idea I would find you here,</p>
<p>and - but what&#x27;s the matter with you, man?  Have you got the</p>
<p>plague?  or has your mysterious inamorata jilted you? or what</p>
<p>other annoyance has happened to make you look as woebegone as old</p>
<p>King Lear, sent adrift by his tender daughters to take care of</p>
<p>himself?&quot;</p>
<p>The individual addressed lifted his head, disclosing a dark and</p>
<p>rather handsome face, settled now into a look of gloomy</p>
<p>discontent.  He slightly raised his hat as he saw who his</p>
<p>questioner was.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! it&#x27;s you, Sir Norman!  I had given up all notion of your</p>
<p>coming, and was about to quit this confounded babel - this</p>
<p>tumultuous den of thieves.  What has detained you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was on duty at Whitehall.  Are we not in time to keep our</p>
<p>appointment?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, certainly!  La Masque is at home to visitors at all hours,</p>
<p>day and night.  I believe in my soul she doesn&#x27;t know what sleep</p>
<p>means.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you are still as much in love with her as ever, I dare</p>
<p>swear!   I have no doubt, now, it was of her you were thinking</p>
<p>when I came up.  Nothing else could ever have made you look so</p>
<p>dismally woebegone as you did, when Providence sent me to your</p>
<p>relief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was thinking of her,&quot; said the young man moodily, and with a</p>
<p>darkening brow.</p>
<p>Sir Norman favored him with a half-amused, half-contemptuous</p>
<p>stare for a moment; then stopped at a huckster&#x27;s stall to</p>
<p>purchase some cigarettes; lit one, and after smoking for a few</p>
<p>minutes, pleasantly remarked, as if the fact had just struck him:</p>
<p>&quot;Ormiston, you&#x27;re a fool!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know it!&quot; said Ormiston, sententiously.</p>
<p>&quot;The idea,&quot; said Sir Norman, knocking the ashes daintily off the</p>
<p>end of his cigar with the tip of his little finger - &quot;the idea of</p>
<p>falling in love with a woman whose face you have never seen!  I</p>
<p>can understand a man a going to any absurd extreme when he falls</p>
<p>in love in proper Christian fashion, with a proper Christian</p>
<p>face; but to go stark, staring mad, as you have done, my dear</p>
<p>fellow, about a black loo mask, why - I consider that a little</p>
<p>too much of a good thing!  Come, let us go.&quot;</p>
<p>Nodding easily to his numerous acquaintances as he went, Sir</p>
<p>Norman Kingsley sauntered leisurely down Paul&#x27;s Walk, and out</p>
<p>through the great door of the cathedral, followed by his</p>
<p>melancholy friend.  Pausing for a moment to gaze at the gorgeous</p>
<p>sunset with a look of languid admiration, Sir Norman passed his</p>
<p>arm through that of his friend, and they walked on at rather a</p>
<p>rapid pace, in the direction of old London Bridge.  There were</p>
<p>few people abroad, except the watchmen walking slowly up and down</p>
<p>before the plague-stricken houses; but in every street they</p>
<p>passed through they noticed huge piles of wood and coal heaped</p>
<p>down the centre.  Smoking zealously they had walked on for a</p>
<p>season in silence, when Ormiston ceased puffing for a moment, to</p>
<p>inquire:</p>
<p>&quot;What are all these for?  This is a strange time, I should</p>
<p>imagine, for bonfires.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They&#x27;re not bonfires,&quot; said Sir Norman; &quot;at least they are not</p>
<p>intended for that; and if your head was not fuller of that masked</p>
<p>Witch of Endor than common sense (for I believe she is nothing</p>
<p>better than a witch), you could not have helped knowing.  The</p>
<p>Lord Mayor of London has been inspired suddenly, with a notion,</p>
<p>that if several thousand fires are kindled at once in the</p>
<p>streets, it will purify the air, and check the pestilence; so</p>
<p>when St. Paul&#x27;s tolls the hour of midnight, all these piles are</p>
<p>to be fired.  It will be a glorious illumination, no doubt; but</p>
<p>as to its stopping the progress of the plague, I am afraid that</p>
<p>it is altogether too good to be true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why should you doubt it?  The plague cannot last forever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.  But Lilly, the astrologer, who predicted its coming, also</p>
<p>foretold that it would last for many months yet; and since one</p>
<p>prophecy has come true, I see no reason why the other should</p>
<p>not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Except the simple one that there would be nobody left alive to</p>
<p>take it.  All London will be lying in the plague-pits by that</p>
<p>time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A pleasant prospect; but a true one, I have no doubt.  And, as I</p>
<p>have no ambition to be hurled headlong into one of those horrible</p>
<p>holes, I shall leave town altogether in a few days.  And,</p>
<p>Ormiston, I would strongly recommend you to follow my example.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not I!&quot; said Ormiston, in a tone of gloomy resolution.  &quot;While</p>
<p>La Masque stays, so will I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And perhaps die of the plague in a week.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So be it!  I don&#x27;t fear the plague half as much as I do the</p>
<p>thought of losing her!&quot;</p>
<p>Again Sir Norman stared.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I see!  It&#x27;s a hopeless case!  Faith, I begin to feel</p>
<p>curious to see this enchantress, who has managed so effectually</p>
<p>to turn your brain.  When did you see her last?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday,&quot; said Ormiston, with a deep sigh.  &quot;And if she were</p>
<p>made of granite, she could not be harder to me than she is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So she doesn&#x27;t care about you, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not she!  She has a little Blenheim lapdog, that she loves a</p>
<p>thousand times more than she ever will me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what an idiot you are, to keep haunting her like her</p>
<p>shadow!   Why don&#x27;t you be a man, and tear out from your heart</p>
<p>such a goddess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! that&#x27;s easily said; but if you were in my place, you&#x27;d act</p>
<p>exactly as I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t believe it.  It&#x27;s not in me to go mad about anything</p>
<p>with a masked face and a marble heart.  If I loved any woman -</p>
<p>which, thank Fortune! at this present time I do not - and she had</p>
<p>the bad taste not to return it, I should take my hat, make her a</p>
<p>bow, and go directly and love somebody else made of flesh and</p>
<p>blood, instead of cast iron!  You know the old song, Ormiston:</p>

<p>&quot;Kingsley, you know nothing about it!&quot; said Ormiston,</p>
<p>impatiently. &quot;So stop talking nonsense.  If you are cold-blooded,</p>
<p>I am not; and - I love her!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman slightly shrugged his shoulders, and flung his</p>
<p>smoked-out weed into a heap of fire-wood.</p>
<p>&quot;Are we near her house?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Yonder is the bridge.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yonder is the house,&quot; replied Ormiston, pointing to a large</p>
<p>ancient building - ancient even for those times - with three</p>
<p>stories, each projecting over the other.  &quot;See! while the houses</p>
<p>on either side are marked as pest-stricken, hers alone bears no</p>
<p>cross.  So it is: those who cling to life are stricken with</p>
<p>death: and those who, like me, are desperate, even death shuns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my dear Ormiston, you surely are not so far gone as that?</p>
<p>Upon my honor, I had no idea you were in such a bad way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am nothing but a miserable wretch! and I wish to Heaven I was</p>
<p>in yonder dead-cart, with the rest of them - and she, too, if she</p>
<p>never intends to love me!&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston spoke with such fierce earnestness, that there was no</p>
<p>doubting his sincerity; and Sir Norman became profoundly shocked</p>
<ul>
<li>so much so, that he did not speak again until they were almost</li>
</ul>
<p>at the door.  Then he opened his lips to ask, in a subdued tone:</p>
<p>&quot;She has predicted the future for you - what did she foretell?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing good; no fear of there being anything in store for such</p>
<p>an unlucky dog as I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did she learn this wonderful black art of hers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the East, I believe.  She has been there and all over the</p>
<p>world; and now visits England for the first time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She has chosen a sprightly season for her visit.  Is she not</p>
<p>afraid of the plague, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; she fears nothing,&quot; said Ormiston, as he knocked loudly at</p>
<p>the door.  &quot;I begin to believe she is made of adamant instead of</p>
<p>what other women are made of.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which is a rib, I believe,&quot; observed Sir Norman, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&quot;And that accounts, I dare say, for their being of such a crooked</p>
<p>and cantankerous nature.  They&#x27;re a wonderful race women are; and</p>
<p>for what Inscrutable reason it has pleased Providence to create</p>
<p>them - &quot;</p>
<p>The opening of the door brought to a sudden end this little touch</p>
<p>of moralizing, and a wrinkled old porter thrust out a very</p>
<p>withered and unlovely face.</p>
<p>&quot;La Masque at home?&quot; inquired Ormiston, stepping in, without</p>
<p>ceremony.</p>
<p>The old man nodded, and pointed up stairs; and with a &quot;This way,</p>
<p>Kingsley,&quot; Ormiston sprang lightly up, three at a time, followed</p>
<p>in the same style by Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;You seem pretty well acquainted with the latitude and longitude</p>
<p>of this place,&quot; observed that young gentleman, as they passed</p>
<p>into a room at the head of the stairs.</p>
<p>&quot;I ought to be; I&#x27;ve been here often enough,&quot; said Ormiston.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the common waiting-room for all who wish to consult La</p>
<p>Masque.  That old bag of bones who let us in has gone to announce</p>
<p>us.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman took a seat, and glanced curiously round the room.  It</p>
<p>was a common-place apartment enough, with a floor of polished</p>
<p>black oak, slippery as ice, and shining like glass; a few old</p>
<p>Flemish paintings on the walls; a large, round table in the</p>
<p>centre of the floor, on which lay a pair of the old musical</p>
<p>instruments called &quot;virginals.&quot;  Two large, curtainless windows,</p>
<p>with minute diamond-shaped panes, set in leaden casements,</p>
<p>admitted the golden and crimson light.</p>
<p>&quot;For the reception-room of a sorceress,&quot; remarked Sir Norman,</p>
<p>with an air of disappointed criticism, &quot;there is nothing very</p>
<p>wonderful about all this.  How is it she spaes fortunes any way?</p>
<p>As Lilly does by maps and charts; or as these old Eastern mufti</p>
<p>do it by magic mirrors and all each fooleries?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither,&quot; said Ormiston, &quot;her style in more like that of the</p>
<p>Indian almechs, who show you your destiny in a well.  She has a</p>
<p>sort of magic lake in her room, and - but you will see it all for</p>
<p>yourself presently.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have always heard,&quot; said Sir Norman, in the same meditative</p>
<p>way, &quot;that truth lies at the bottom of a well, and I am glad some</p>
<p>one has turned up at last who is able to fish it out.  Ah!  Here</p>
<p>comes our ancient Mercury to show us to the presence of your</p>
<p>goddess.&quot;</p>
<p>The door opened, and the &quot;old bag of bones,&quot; as Ormiston</p>
<p>irreverently styled his lady-love&#x27;s ancient domestic, made a sign</p>
<p>for them to follow him.  Leading the way down along a corridor,</p>
<p>he flung open a pair of shining folding-doors at the end, and</p>
<p>ushered them at once into the majestic presence of the sorceress</p>
<p>and her magic room.  Both gentlemen doffed their plumed hats.</p>
<p>Ormiston stepped forward at once; but Sir Norman discreetly</p>
<p>paused in the doorway to contemplate the scene of action.  As he</p>
<p>slowly did so, a look of deep displeasure settled on his</p>
<p>features, on finding it not half so awful as he had supposed.</p>
<p>In some ways it was very like the room they had left, being low,</p>
<p>large, and square, and having floors, walls and ceiling paneled</p>
<p>with glossy black oak.  But it had no windows - a large bronze</p>
<p>lamp, suspended from the centre of the ceiling, shed a</p>
<p>flickering, ghostly light.  There were no paintings - some grim</p>
<p>carvings of skulls, skeletons, and serpents, pleasantly wreathed</p>
<p>the room - neither were there seats nor tables - nothing but a</p>
<p>huge ebony caldron at the upper end of the apartment, over which</p>
<p>a grinning skeleton on wires, with a scythe in one hand of bone,</p>
<p>and an hour-glass in the other, kept watch and ward.  Opposite</p>
<p>this cheerful-looking guardian, was a tall figure in black,</p>
<p>standing an motionless as if it, too, was carved in ebony.  It</p>
<p>was a female figure, very tall and slight, but as beautifully</p>
<p>symmetrical as a Venus Celestis.  Her dress was of black velvet,</p>
<p>that swept the polished floor, spangled all over with stars of</p>
<p>gold and rich rubies.  A profusion of shining black hair fell in</p>
<p>waves and curls almost to her feet; but her face, from forehead</p>
<p>to chin, was completely hidden by a black velvet mask.  In one</p>
<p>hand, exquisitely small and white, she held a gold casket,</p>
<p>blazing (like her dress) with rubies, and with the other she</p>
<p>toyed with a tame viper, that had twined itself round her wrist.</p>
<p>This was doubtless La Masque, and becoming conscious of that fact</p>
<p>Sir Norman made her a low and courtly bow.  She returned it by a</p>
<p>slight bend of the head, and turning toward his companion, spoke</p>
<p>&quot;You here, again, Mr. Ormiston!  To what am I indebted for the</p>
<p>honor of two visits in two days?&quot;</p>
<p>Her voice, Sir Norman thought, was the sweetest he had ever</p>
<p>heard, musical as a chime of silver bells, soft as the tones of</p>
<p>an aeolian harp through which the west wind plays.</p>
<p>&quot;Madam, I am aware my visits are undesired,&quot; said Ormiston, with</p>
<p>a flushing cheek and, slightly tremulous voice; &quot;but I have</p>
<p>merely come with my friend, Sir Norman Kingsley, who wishes to</p>
<p>know what the future has in store for him.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus invoked, Sir Norman Kingsley stepped forward with another</p>
<p>low bow to the masked lady.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, madam, I have long heard that those fair fingers can</p>
<p>withdraw the curtain of the future, and I have come to see what</p>
<p>Dame Destiny is going to do for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley is welcome,&quot; said the sweet voice, &quot;and</p>
<p>shall see what he desires.  There is but one condition, that he</p>
<p>will keep perfectly silent; for if he speaks, the scene he</p>
<p>beholds will vanish.  Come forward!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman compressed his lips as closely am if they were forever</p>
<p>hermetically sealed, and came forward accordingly.  Leaning over</p>
<p>the edge of the ebony caldron, he found that it contained nothing</p>
<p>more dreadful than water, for he labored under a vague and</p>
<p>unpleasant idea that, like the witches&#x27; caldron in Macbeth, it</p>
<p>might be filled with serpents&#x27; blood and children&#x27;s&#x27; brains.  La</p>
<p>Masque opened her golden casket, and took from it a portion of</p>
<p>red powder, with which it was filled.  Casting it into the</p>
<p>caldron, she murmured an invocation in Sanscrit, or Coptic, or</p>
<p>some other unknown tongue, and slowly there arose a dense cloud</p>
<p>of dark-red smoke, that nearly filled the room.  Had Sir Norman</p>
<p>ever read the story of Aladdin, he would probably have thought of</p>
<p>it then; but the young courtier did not greatly affect literature</p>
<p>of any kind, and thought of nothing now but of seeing something</p>
<p>when the smoke cleared away.  It was rather long in doing so, and</p>
<p>when it did, he saw nothing at first but his own handsome, half-</p>
<p>serious,</p>
<p>half-incredulous face; but gradually a picture, distinct and</p>
<p>clear, formed itself at the bottom, and Sir Norman gazed with</p>
<p>bewildered eyes.  He saw a large room filled with a sparkling</p>
<p>crowd, many of them ladies, splendidly arrayed and flashing in</p>
<p>jewels, and foremost among them stood one whose beauty surpassed</p>
<p>anything he had ever before dreamed of.  She wore the robes of a</p>
<p>queen, purple and ermine - diamonds blazed on the beautiful neck,</p>
<p>arms, and fingers, and a tiara of the same brilliants crowned her</p>
<p>regal head.  In one hand she held a sceptre; what seemed to be a</p>
<p>throne was behind her, but something that surprised Sir Norton</p>
<p>most of all was, to find himself standing beside her, the</p>
<p>cynosure of all eyes.  While he yet gazed in mingled astonishment</p>
<p>and incredulity, the scene faded away, and another took its</p>
<p>place.  This time a dungeon-cell, damp and dismal; walls, and</p>
<p>floor, and ceiling covered with green and hideous slime.  A small</p>
<p>lamp stood on the floor, and by its sickly, watery gleam, he saw</p>
<p>himself again standing, pale and dejected, near the wall.  But he</p>
<p>was not alone; the same glittering vision in purple and diamonds</p>
<p>stood before him, and suddenly he drew his sword and plunged it</p>
<p>up to the hilt in her heart!  The beautiful vision fell like a</p>
<p>stone at his feet, and the sword was drawn out reeking with her</p>
<p>life-blood.  This was a little too much for the real Sir Norman,</p>
<p>and with an expression of indignant consternation, he sprang</p>
<p>upright.  Instantly it all faded away and the reflection of his</p>
<p>own excited face looked up at him from the caldron.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you not to speak,&quot; said La Masque, quietly, &quot;but you must</p>
<p>look on still another scene.&quot;</p>
<p>Again she threw a portion of the contents of the casket into the</p>
<p>caldron, and &quot;spake aloud the words of power.&quot;  Another cloud of</p>
<p>smoke arose and filled the room, and when it cleared away, Sir</p>
<p>Norman beheld a third and less startling sight.  The scene and</p>
<p>place he could not discover, but it seemed to him like night and</p>
<p>a storm.  Two men were lying on the ground, and bound fast</p>
<p>together, it appeared to him.  As he looked, it faded away, and</p>
<p>once more his own face seemed to mock him in the clear water.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know those two last figures!&quot; asked the lady.</p>
<p>&quot;I do,&quot; said Sir Norman, promptly; &quot;it was Ormiston and myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right! and one of them was dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, with a perceptible start. &quot;Which</p>
<p>one, madam?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you cannot tell that, neither can I.  If there is anything</p>
<p>further you wish to see, I am quite willing to show it to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m obliged to you,&quot; said Sir Norman, stepping back; &quot;but no</p>
<p>more at present, thank you.  Do you mean to say, madam, that I&#x27;m</p>
<p>some day to murder a lady, especially one so beautiful as she I</p>
<p>just now saw?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have said nothing - all you&#x27;ve seen will come to pass, and</p>
<p>whether your destiny be for good or evil, I have nothing to do</p>
<p>with it, except,&quot; said the sweet voice, earnestly, &quot;that if La</p>
<p>Masque could strew Sir Norman Kingsley&#x27;s pathway with roses, she</p>
<p>would most assuredly do so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madam, you are too kind,&quot; said that young gentleman, laying his</p>
<p>hand on his heart, while Ormiston scowled darkly - &quot;more</p>
<p>especially as I&#x27;ve the misfortune to be a perfect stranger to</p>
<p>you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not so, Sir Norman.  I have known you this many a day; and</p>
<p>before long we shall be better acquainted.  Permit me to wish you</p>
<p>good evening!&quot;</p>
<p>At this gentle hint, both gentlemen bowed themselves out, and</p>
<p>soon found themselves in the street, with very different</p>
<p>expressions of countenance.  Sir Norman looking considerably</p>
<p>pleased and decidedly puzzled, and Mr. Ormiston looking savagely</p>
<p>and uncompromisingly jealous.  The animated skeleton who had</p>
<p>admitted them closed the door after them; and the two friends</p>
<p>stood in the twilight on London Bridge.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<p>THE DEAD BRIDE</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Ormiston, drawing a long bath, &quot;what do you think of</p>
<p>&quot;that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Think?  Don&#x27;t ask me yet.&quot; said Sir Norman, looking rather</p>
<p>bewildered.  &quot;I&#x27;m in such a state of mystification that I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>rightly know whether I&#x27;m standing on my head or feet.  For one</p>
<p>thing, I have come to the conclusion that your masked ladylove</p>
<p>must be enchantingly beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have I not told you that a thousand times, O thou of little</p>
<p>faith?  But why have you come to such a conclusion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because no woman with such a figure, such a voice and such hands</p>
<p>could be otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I knew you would own it some day.  Do you wonder now that I love</p>
<p>her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! as to loving her,&quot; said Sir Norman, coolly, &quot;that&#x27;s quite</p>
<p>another thing.  I could no more love her or her hands, voice, and</p>
<p>shape, than I could a figure in wood or wax; but I admire her</p>
<p>vastly, and think her extremely clever.  I will never forget that</p>
<p>face in the caldron.  It was the most exquisitely beautiful I</p>
<p>ever saw.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In love with the shadow of a face!  Why, you are a thousand-fold</p>
<p>more absurd than I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Sir Norman, thoughtfully, &quot;I don&#x27;t know as I&#x27;m in love</p>
<p>with it; but if ever I see a living face like it, I certainly</p>
<p>shall be.  How did La Masque do it, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You had better ask her,&quot; said Ormiston, bitterly.  &quot;She seems to</p>
<p>have taken an unusual interest in you at first sight.  She would</p>
<p>strew your path with roses, forsooth!  Nothing earthly, I</p>
<p>believe, would make her say anything half so tender to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman laughed, and stroked his moustache complacently.</p>
<p>&quot;All a matter of taste, my dear fellow: and these women are noted</p>
<p>for their perfection in that line.  I begin to admire La Masque</p>
<p>more and more, and I think you had better give up the chase, and</p>
<p>let me take your place.  I don&#x27;t believe you have the ghost of a</p>
<p>chance, Ormiston.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t believe it myself,&quot; said Ormiston, with a desperate face</p>
<p>&quot;but until the plague carries me off I cannot give her up; and</p>
<p>the sooner that happens, the better.  Ha! what is this?&quot;</p>
<p>It was a piercing shriek - no unusual sound; and as he spoke, the</p>
<p>door of an adjoining house was flung open, a woman rushed wildly</p>
<p>out, fled down an adjoining street, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Sir Norman and his companion looked at each other, and then at</p>
<p>the house.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s all this about?&quot; demanded Ormiston.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s a question I can&#x27;t take it upon myself to answer,&quot; said</p>
<p>Sir Norman; &quot;and the only way to solve the mystery, is to go in</p>
<p>and see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It may be the plague,&quot; said Ormiston, hesitating.  &quot;Yet the</p>
<p>house is not marked.  There is a watchman.  I will ask him.&quot;</p>
<p>The man with the halberd in his hand was walking up and down</p>
<p>before an adjoining house, bearing the ominous red cross and</p>
<p>piteous inscription:  &quot;Lord have mercy on us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know, sir,&quot; was his answer to Ormiston.  &quot;If any one</p>
<p>there has the plague, they must have taken it lately; for I heard</p>
<p>this morning there was to be a wedding there to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never heard of any one screaming in that fashion about a</p>
<p>wedding,&quot; said Ormiston, doubtfully.  &quot;Do you know who lives</p>
<p>there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir.  I only came here, myself, yesterday, but two or three</p>
<p>times to-day I have seen a very beautiful young lady looking out</p>
<p>of the window.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston thanked the man, and went back to report to his friend.</p>
<p>&quot;A beautiful young lady!&quot; said Sir Norman, with energy.  &quot;Then I</p>
<p>mean to go directly up and see about it, and you can follow or</p>
<p>not, just as you please.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, Sir Norman entered the open doorway, and found himself</p>
<p>in a long hall, flanked by a couple of doors on each side.  These</p>
<p>he opened in rapid succession, finding nothing but silence and</p>
<p>solitude; and Ormiston - who, upon reflection, chose to follow -</p>
<p>ran up a wide and sweeping staircase at the end of the hall.  Sir</p>
<p>Norman followed him, and they came to a hall similar to the one</p>
<p>below.  A door to the right lay open; and both entered without</p>
<p>ceremony, and looked around.</p>
<p>The room was spacious, and richly furnished.  Just enough light</p>
<p>stole through the oriel window at the further end, draped with</p>
<p>crimson satin embroidered with gold, to show it.  The floor was</p>
<p>of veined wood of many colors, arranged in fanciful mosaics, and</p>
<p>strewn with Turkish rugs and Persian mats of gorgeous colors.</p>
<p>The walls were carved, the ceiling corniced, and all fretted with</p>
<p>gold network and gilded mouldings.  On a couch covered with</p>
<p>crimson satin, like the window drapery, lay a cithren and some</p>
<p>loose sheets of music.  Near it was a small marble table, covered</p>
<p>with books and drawings, with a decanter of wine and an exquisite</p>
<p>little goblet of Bohemian glass.  The marble mantel was strewn</p>
<p>with ornaments of porcelain and alabaster, and a</p>
<p>beautifully-carved vase of Parian marble stood in the centre,</p>
<p>filled with brilliant flowers.  A great mirror reflected back the</p>
<p>room, and beneath it stood a toilet-table, strewn with jewels,</p>
<p>laces, perfume-bottles, and an array of costly little feminine</p>
<p>trifles such as ladies were as fond of two centuries ago as they</p>
<p>are to-day.  Evidently it was a lady&#x27;s chamber; for in a recess</p>
<p>near the window stood a great quaint carved bedstead, with</p>
<p>curtains and snowy lace, looped back with golden arrows and</p>
<p>scarlet ribbons.  Some one lay on it, too - at least, Ormiston</p>
<p>thought so; and he went cautiously forward, drew the curtain, and</p>
<p>looked down.</p>
<p>&quot;Great Heaven! what a beautiful face!&quot; was his cry, as he bent</p>
<p>still further down.</p>
<p>&quot;What the plague is the matter?&quot; asked Sir Norman, coming</p>
<p>forward.</p>
<p>&quot;You have said it,&quot; said Ormiston, recoiling.  &quot;The plague is the</p>
<p>matter.  There lies one dead of it!&quot;</p>
<p>Curiosity proving stronger than fear, Sir Norman stepped forward</p>
<p>to look at the corpse.  It was a young girl with a face as lovely</p>
<p>as a poet&#x27;s vision.  That face was like snow, now; and, in its</p>
<p>calm, cold majesty, looked as exquisitely perfect as some ancient</p>
<p>Grecian statue.  The low, pearly brow, the sweet, beautiful lips,</p>
<p>the delicate oval outline of countenance, were perfect.  The eyes</p>
<p>were closed, and the long dark lashes rested on the ivory cheeks.</p>
<p>A profusion of shining dark hair fell in elaborate curls over her</p>
<p>neck and shoulders.  Her dress was that of a bride; a robe of</p>
<p>white satin brocaded with silver, fairly dazzling in its shining</p>
<p>radiance, and as brief in the article of sleeves and neck as that</p>
<p>of any modern belle.  A circlet of pearls were clasped round her</p>
<p>snow-white throat, and bracelets of the same jewels encircled the</p>
<p>snowy taper arms.  On her head she wore a bridal wreath and veil</p>
<ul>
<li>the former of jewels, the latter falling round her like a cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>of mist.  Everything was perfect, from the wreath and veil to the</p>
<p>tiny sandaled feet and lying there in her mute repose she looked</p>
<p>more like some exquisite piece of sculpture than anything that</p>
<p>had ever lived and moved in this groveling world of ours.  But</p>
<p>from one shoulder the dress had been pulled down, and there lay a</p>
<p>great livid purple plague-spot!</p>
<p>&quot;Come away!&quot; said Ormiston, catching his companion by the arm.</p>
<p>&quot;It is death to remain here!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman had been standing like one in a trance, from which</p>
<p>this address roused him, and he grasped Ormiston&#x27;s shoulder</p>
<p>almost frantically.</p>
<p>&quot;Look there, Ormiston!  There lies the very face that sorceress</p>
<p>showed me, fifteen minutes ago, in her infernal caldron!  I would</p>
<p>know it at the other end of the world!&quot;;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; said Ormiston, glancing again with new curiosity</p>
<p>at the marble face.  &quot;I never saw anything half so beautiful in</p>
<p>all my life; but you see she is dead of the plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead?   she cannot be!  Nothing so perfect could die!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look there,&quot; said Ormiston pointing to the plague-spot.  &quot;There</p>
<p>is the fatal token!  For Heaven&#x27;s sake let us get out of this, or</p>
<p>we will share the same fate before morning!&quot;</p>
<p>But Sir Norman did not move - could not move; he stood there</p>
<p>rooted to the spot by the spell of that lovely, lifeless face.</p>
<p>Usually the plague left its victims hideous, ghastly, discolored,</p>
<p>and covered with blotches; but in this case then was nothing to</p>
<p>mar the perfect beauty of the satin-smooth skin, but that one</p>
<p>dreadful mark.</p>
<p>There Sir Norman stood in his trance, as motionless as if some</p>
<p>genii out of the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; had suddenly turned him into</p>
<p>stone (a trick they were much addicted to), and destined him to</p>
<p>remain there an ornamental fixture for ever.  Ormiston looked at</p>
<p>him distractedly, uncertain whether to try moral suasion or to</p>
<p>take him by the collar and drag him headlong down the stairs,</p>
<p>when a providential but rather dismal circumstance came to his</p>
<p>relief.  A cart came rattling along the street, a bell was loudly</p>
<p>rang, and a hoarse voice arose with it:  &quot;Bring out your dead!</p>
<p>Bring out your dead!&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston rushed down stair to intercept the dead-cart, already</p>
<p>almost full on it way to the plague-pit.  The driver stopped at</p>
<p>his call, and instantly followed him up stairs, and into the</p>
<p>room.  Glancing at the body with the utmost sang-froid, he</p>
<p>touched the dress, and indifferently remarked:</p>
<p>&quot;A bride, I should say; and an uncommonly handsome one too.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ll just take her along as she is, and strip these nice things</p>
<p>off the body when we get it to the plague-pit.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, he wrapped her in the sheet, and directing Ormiston to</p>
<p>take hold of the two lower ends, took the upper corners himself,</p>
<p>with the air of a man quite used to that sort of thing.  Ormiston</p>
<p>recoiled from touching it; and Sir Norman seeing what they were</p>
<p>about to do, and knowing there was no help for it, made up his</p>
<p>mind, like a sensible young man as he was, to conceal his</p>
<p>feelings, and caught hold of the sheet himself.  In this fashion</p>
<p>the dead bride was carried down stairs, and laid upon a shutter</p>
<p>on the top of a pile of bodies in the dead-cart.</p>
<p>It was now almost dark, and as the cart started, the great clock</p>
<p>of St. Paul&#x27;s struck eight.  St. Michael&#x27;s, St Alban&#x27;s, and the</p>
<p>others took up the sound; and the two young men paused to listen.</p>
<p>For many weeks the sky had been clear, brilliant, and blue; but</p>
<p>on this night dark clouds were scudding in wild unrest across it,</p>
<p>and the air was oppressingly close and sultry.</p>
<p>Where are you going now?&quot; said Ormiston.  &quot;Are you for</p>
<p>Whitehall&#x27;s to night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No!&quot; said Sir Norman, rather dejectedly, turning to follow the</p>
<p>pest-cart.  &quot;I am for the plague-pit in Finsbury fields!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense, man!&quot; exclaimed Ormiston, energetically, &quot;what will</p>
<p>take you there?  You surely are not mad enough to follow the body</p>
<p>of that dead girl?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall follow it!  You can come or not, just as you please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! if you are determined, I will go with you, of course; but it</p>
<p>is the craziest freak I ever heard of.  After this, you need</p>
<p>never laugh at me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never will,&quot; said Sir Norman, moodily; &quot;for if you love a face</p>
<p>you have never seen, I love one I have only looked on when dead.</p>
<p>Does it not seem sacrilege to throw any one so like an angel into</p>
<p>that horrible plague-pit?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never saw an angel,&quot; said Ormiston, as he and his friend</p>
<p>started to go after the dead-cart.  &quot;And I dare say there have</p>
<p>been scores as beautiful as that poor girl thrown into the</p>
<p>plague-pit before now.  I wonder why the house has been deserted,</p>
<p>and if she was really a bride.  The bridegroom could not have</p>
<p>loved her much, I fancy, or not even the pestilence could have</p>
<p>scared him away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, Ormiston, what an extraordinary thing it is that it should</p>
<p>be precisely the same face that the fortune-teller showed me.</p>
<p>There she was alive, and here she is dead; so I&#x27;ve lost all faith</p>
<p>in La Masque for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston looked doubtful.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you quite sure it is the same, Kingsley?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite sure?&quot; said Sir Norman, indignantly.  &quot;Of course I am!  Do</p>
<p>you think I could be mistaken is such a case?  I tell you I would</p>
<p>know that face at Kamschatka or, the North Pole; for I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>believe there ever was such another created.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So be it, then!  Your object, of course, in following that cart</p>
<p>is, to take a last look at her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Precisely so.  Don&#x27;t talk; I feel in no mood for it just at</p>
<p>present.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston smiled to himself, and did not talk, accordingly; and in</p>
<p>silence the two friends followed the gloomy dead-cart.  A faint</p>
<p>young moon, pale and sickly, was struggling dimly through drifts</p>
<p>of dark clouds, and lighted the lonesome, dreary streets with a</p>
<p>wan, watery glimmer.  For weeks, the weather had been brilliantly</p>
<p>fine - the days all sunshine, the nights all moonlight; but now</p>
<p>Ormiston, looking up at the troubled face of the sky, concluded</p>
<p>mentally that the Lord Mayor had selected an unpropitious night</p>
<p>for the grand illumination.  Sir Norman, with his eyes on the</p>
<p>pest-cart, and the long white figure therein, took no heed of</p>
<p>anything in the heaven above or in the earth beneath, and strode</p>
<p>along in dismal silence till they reached, at last, their</p>
<p>journey&#x27;s end.</p>
<p>As the cart stopped the two young men approached the edge of the</p>
<p>plague-pit, and looked in with a shudder.  Truly it was a</p>
<p>horrible sight, that heaving, putrid sea of corruption; for the</p>
<p>bodies of the miserable victims were thrown in in cartfuls, and</p>
<p>only covered with a handful of earth and quicklime.  Here and</p>
<p>there, through the cracking and sinking surface, could be seen</p>
<p>protruding a fair white arm, or a baby face, mingled with the</p>
<p>long, dark tresses of maidens, the golden curls of children, and</p>
<p>the white hairs of old age.  The pestilential effluvia arising</p>
<p>from the dreadful mass was so overpowering that both shrank back,</p>
<p>faint and sick, after a moment&#x27;s survey.  It was indeed as Sir</p>
<p>Norman had, said, a horrible grave wherein to lie.</p>
<p>Meantime the driver, with an eye to business, and no time for</p>
<p>such nonsense as melancholy moralizing, had laid the body of the</p>
<p>young girl on the ground, and briskly turned his cart and dumped</p>
<p>the remainder of his load into the pit.  Then, having flung a few</p>
<p>handfuls of clay over it, he unwound the sheet, and kneeling</p>
<p>beside the body, prepared to remove the jewels.  The rays of the</p>
<p>moon and his dark lantern fell on the lovely, snow-white face</p>
<p>together, and Sir Norman groaned despairingly as he saw its</p>
<p>death-cold rigidity.  The man had stripped the rings off the</p>
<p>fingers, the bracelets off the arms; but as he was about to</p>
<p>perform the same operation toward the necklace, he was stopped by</p>
<p>a startling interruption enough.  In his haste, the clasp entered</p>
<p>the beautiful neck, inflicting a deep scratch, from which the</p>
<p>blood spouted; and at the same instant the dead girl opened her</p>
<p>eyes with a shrill cry.  Uttering a yell of terror, as well he</p>
<p>might, the man sprang back and gazed at her with horror,</p>
<p>believing that his sacrilegious robbery had brought the dead to</p>
<p>life.  Even the two young men-albeit, neither of them given to</p>
<p>nervousness nor cowardice - recoiled for an instant, and stared</p>
<p>aghast.  Then, as the whole truth struck them, that the girl had</p>
<p>been in a deep swoon and not dead, both simultaneously darted</p>
<p>forward, and forgetting all fear of infection, knelt by her side.</p>
<p>A pair of great, lustrous black eyes were staring wildly around,</p>
<p>and fixed themselves first on one face and then on the other.</p>
<p>&quot;Where am I?&quot; she exclaimed, with a terrified look, as she strove</p>
<p>to raise herself on her elbow, and fell instantaneously back with</p>
<p>a cry of agony, as she felt for the first time the throbbing</p>
<p>anguish of the wound.</p>
<p>You are with friends, dear lady!&quot; said Sir Norman, in a voice</p>
<p>quite tremulous between astonishment and delight.  &quot;Fear nothing,</p>
<p>for you shall be saved.&quot;</p>
<p>The great black eyes turned wildly upon him, while a fierce spasm</p>
<p>convulsed the beautiful face.</p>
<p>&quot;O, my God, I remember!  I have the plague!&quot;  And, with a</p>
<p>prolonged shriek of anguish, that thrilled even to the hardened</p>
<p>heart of the dead-cart driver, the girl fell back senseless</p>
<p>again.  Sir Norman Kingsley sprang to his feet, and with more the</p>
<p>air of a frantic lunatic than a responsible young English knight,</p>
<p>caught the cold form in his arms, laid it in the dead-cart, and</p>
<p>was about springing into the driver&#x27;s seat, when that individual</p>
<p>indignantly interposed.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, now; none of that!  If you were the king himself, you</p>
<p>shouldn&#x27;t run away with my cart in that fashion; so you just get</p>
<p>out of my place as fast as you can!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Kingsley, what are you about to do?&quot; asked Ormiston,</p>
<p>catching his excited friend by the arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Do!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, in a high key.  &quot;Can&#x27;t you see that</p>
<p>for yourself!  And I&#x27;m going to have that girl cured of the</p>
<p>plague, if there is such a thing as a doctor to be had for love</p>
<p>or money in London.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You had better have her taken to the pest house at once, then;</p>
<p>there are chirurgeons and nurses enough there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To the pest-house!  Why man, I might as well have her thrown</p>
<p>into the plague-pit there, at once!  Not I!  I shall have her</p>
<p>taken to my own house, and there properly cared for, and this</p>
<p>good fellow will drive her there instantly.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman backed this insinuation by putting a broad gold-piece</p>
<p>into the driver&#x27;s hand, which instantly produced a magical effect</p>
<p>on his rather surly countenance.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; he began, springing into his seat with</p>
<p>alacrity. &quot;Where shall I drive the young lady to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Follow me,&quot; said Sir Norman.  &quot;Come along, Ormiston.&quot;  And</p>
<p>seizing his friend by the arm, he hurried along with a velocity</p>
<p>rather uncomfortable, considering they both wore cloaks, and the</p>
<p>night was excessively sultry.  The gloomy vehicle and its</p>
<p>fainting burden followed close behind.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean to do with her?&quot; asked Ormiston, as soon as he</p>
<p>found breath enough to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;Haven&#x27;t I told you?&quot; said Sir Norman, impatiently.  Take her</p>
<p>home, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And after that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go for a doctor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And after that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take care of her till she gets well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And after that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why - find out her history, and all about her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And after that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After that!  After that!  How do I know what after that!&quot;</p>
<p>exclaimed Sir Norman, rather fiercely.  &quot;Ormiston, what do you</p>
<p>mean?&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;And after that you&#x27;ll marry her, I suppose!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps I may, if she will have me.  And what if I do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, nothing!  Only it struck me you may be saving another man&#x27;s</p>
<p>wife.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s true!&quot; said Sir Norman, in a subdued tone, &quot;and if such</p>
<p>should unhappily be the case, nothing will remain but to live in</p>
<p>hopes that he may be carried off by the plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pray Heaven that we may not be carried off by it ourselves!&quot;</p>
<p>said Ormiston, with a slight shudder.  &quot;I shall dream of nothing</p>
<p>but that horrible plague-pit for a week.  If it were not for La</p>
<p>Masque, I would not stay another hour in this pest-stricken</p>
<p>city.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here we are,&quot; was Sir Norman&#x27;s rather inapposite answer, as they</p>
<p>entered Piccadilly, and stopped before a large and handsome</p>
<p>house, whose gloomy portal was faintly illuminated by a large</p>
<p>lamp.  &quot;Here, my man just carry the lady in.&quot;</p>
<p>He unlocked the door as he spoke, and led the way across a long</p>
<p>hall to a sleeping chamber, elegantly fitter up.  The man placed</p>
<p>the body on the bed and departed while Sir Norman, seizing a</p>
<p>handbell, rang a peal that brought a staid-looking housekeeper to</p>
<p>the scene directly.  Seeing a lady, young and beautiful, in bride</p>
<p>robes, lying apparently dead on her young master&#x27;s bed at that</p>
<p>hour of the night, the discreet matron, over whose virtuous head</p>
<p>fifty years and a snow-white cap had passed, started back with a</p>
<p>slight scream.</p>
<p>&quot;Gracious me, Sir Norman!  What on earth is the meaning of this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Mrs. Preston,&quot; began Sir Norman blandly, this young lady</p>
<p>is ill of the plague, and - &quot;</p>
<p>But all further explanation was cut short by a horrified shriek</p>
<p>from the old lady, and a precipitate rush from the room.  Down</p>
<p>stairs she flew, informing the other servants as she went,</p>
<p>between her screams, and when Sir Norman, in a violent rage, went</p>
<p>in search of her five minutes after, he found not only the</p>
<p>kitchen, but the whole house deserted.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Ormiston, as Sir Norman strode back, looking fiery</p>
<p>hot and savagely angry.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, they have all fled, every man and woman of them, the - &quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman ground out something not quite proper, behind his</p>
<p>moustache. &quot;I shall have to go for the doctor, myself.  Doctor</p>
<p>Forbes is a friend of mine, and lives near; and you,&quot; looking at</p>
<p>him rather doubtfully, &quot;would you mind staying here, lest she</p>
<p>should recover consciousness before I return?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To tell you the truth,&quot; said Ormiston, with charming frankness,</p>
<p>&quot;I should!  The lady is extremely beautiful, I must own; but she</p>
<p>looks uncomfortably corpse-like at this present moment.  I do not</p>
<p>wish to die of the plague, either, until I see La Masque once</p>
<p>more; and so if it is all the same to you, my dear friend, I will</p>
<p>have the greatest pleasure in stepping round with you to the</p>
<p>doctor&#x27;s.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman, though he did not much approve of this, could not</p>
<p>very well object, and the two sallied forth together.  Walking a</p>
<p>short distance up Piccadilly, they struck off into a bye street,</p>
<p>and soon reached the house they were in search of.  Sir Norman</p>
<p>knocked loudly at the door, which was opened by the doctor</p>
<p>himself.  Briefly and rapidly Sir Norman informed him how and</p>
<p>where his services were required; and the doctor being always</p>
<p>provided with everything necessary for such cases, set out with</p>
<p>him immediately.  Fifteen minutes after leaving his own house,</p>
<p>Sir Norman was back there again, and standing in his own chamber.</p>
<p>But a simultaneous exclamation of amazement and consternation</p>
<p>broke from him and Ormiston, as on entering the room they found</p>
<p>the bed empty, and the lady gone!</p>
<p>A dead pause followed, during which the three looked blankly at</p>
<p>the bed, and then at each other.  The scene, no doubt, would have</p>
<p>been ludicrous enough to a third party; but neither of our trio</p>
<p>could saw anything whatever to laugh at.  Ormiston was the first</p>
<p>to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;What in Heaven&#x27;s name has happened!&quot; he wonderingly exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Some one has been here,&quot; said Sir Norman, turning very pale,</p>
<p>&quot;and carried her off while we were gone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let us search the house,&quot; said the doctor; &quot;you should have</p>
<p>locked your door, Sir Norman; but it may not be too late yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Acting on the hint, Sir Norman seized the lamp burning on the</p>
<p>table, and started on the search.  His two friends followed him,</p>
<p>and</p>

<p>No, though there was not the slightest trace of robbers or</p>
<p>intruders, neither was there the slightest trace of the beautiful</p>
<p>plague-patient.  Everything in the house was precisely as it</p>
<p>always was, but the silver shining vision was gone.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<p>THE COURT PAGE</p>
<p>The search was given over at last in despair, and the doctor took</p>
<p>his hat and disappeared.  Sir Norman and Ormiston stopped in the</p>
<p>lower hall and looked at each other in mute amaze.</p>
<p>&quot;What can it all mean?&quot; asked Ormiston, appealing more to society</p>
<p>at large than to his bewildered companion.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven&#x27;t the faintest idea,&quot; said Sir Norman, distractedly;</p>
<p>&quot;only I am pretty certain, if I don&#x27;t find her, I shall do</p>
<p>something so desperate that the plague will be a trifle compared</p>
<p>to it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems almost impossible that she can have been carried off -</p>
<p>doesn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If she has!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, &quot;and I find out the abductor,</p>
<p>he won&#x27;t have a whole bone in his body two minutes after!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet more impossible that she can have gone off herself,&quot;</p>
<p>pursued Ormiston with the air of one entering upon an abstruse</p>
<p>subject, and taking no heed whatever of his companion&#x27;s marginal</p>
<p>notes.</p>
<p>&quot;Gone off herself!  Is the man crazy?&quot; inquired Sir Norman, with</p>
<p>a stare.  &quot;Fifteen minutes before we left her dead, or in a dead</p>
<p>swoon, which is all the same in Greek, and yet he talks of her</p>
<p>getting up and going off herself!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, the only way to get at the bottom of the mystery,&quot; said</p>
<p>Ormiston, &quot;is to go in search of her.  Sleeping, I suppose, is</p>
<p>out of the question.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it is!  I shall never sleep again till I find her!&quot;</p>
<p>They passed out, and Sir Norman this time took the precaution of</p>
<p>turning the key, thereby fulfilling the adage of locking the</p>
<p>stable-door when the steed was stolen.  The night had grown</p>
<p>darker and hotter; and as they walked along, the clock of St.</p>
<p>Paul&#x27;s tolled nine.</p>
<p>&quot;And now, where shall we go?&quot; inquired Sir Norman, as they</p>
<p>rapidly hurried on.</p>
<p>&quot;I should recommend visiting the house we found her first; if not</p>
<p>there, then we can try the pest-house.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman shuddered.</p>
<p>&quot;Heaven forefend she should be there!  It is the most mysterious</p>
<p>thing ever I heard of!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think now of La Masque&#x27;s prediction - dare you doubt</p>
<p>still?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ormiston, I don&#x27;t know what to think.  It is the same face I</p>
<p>saw, and yet - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well - and yet - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t tell you - I am fairly bewildered.  If we don&#x27;t find the</p>
<p>lady st her own house, I have half a mind to apply to your</p>
<p>friend, La Masque, again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The wisest thing you could do, my dear fellow.  If any one knows</p>
<p>your unfortunate beloved&#x27;s whereabouts, it is La Masque, depend</p>
<p>upon it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s settled then; and now, don&#x27;t talk, for conversation at</p>
<p>this smart pace I don&#x27;t admire.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston, like the amiable, obedient young man that he was,</p>
<p>instantly held his tongue, and they strode along at a breathless</p>
<p>pace.  There was an unusual concourse of men abroad that night,</p>
<p>watching the gloomy face of the sky, and waiting the hour of</p>
<p>midnight to kindle the myriad of fires; and as the two tall, dark</p>
<p>figures went rapidly by, all supposed it to be a case of life or</p>
<p>death.  In the eyes of one of the party, perhaps it was; and</p>
<p>neither halted till they came once more in sight of the house,</p>
<p>whence a short time previously they had carried the death-cold</p>
<p>bride.  A row of lamps over the door-portals shed a yellow,</p>
<p>uncertain light around, while the lights of barges and wherries</p>
<p>were sown like stars along the river.</p>
<p>&quot;There is the house,&quot; cried Ormiston, and both paused to take</p>
<p>breath; &quot;and I am about at the last gasp.  I wonder if your</p>
<p>pretty mistress would feel grateful if she knew what I have come</p>
<p>through to-night for her sweet sake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are no lights,&quot; mad Sir Norman, glancing ,anxiously up at</p>
<p>the darkened front of the house; &quot;even the link before the door</p>
<p>is unlit.  Surely she cannot be there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That remains to be seen, though I&#x27;m very doubtful about it</p>
<p>myself.  Ah I who have we here?&quot;</p>
<p>The door of the house in question opened, as he spoke, and a</p>
<p>figure - a man&#x27;s figure, wearing a slouched hat and long, dark</p>
<p>cloak, came slowly out.  He stopped before the house and looked</p>
<p>at it long and earnestly; and, by the twinkling light of the</p>
<p>lamps, the friends saw enough of him to know he was young and</p>
<p>distinguished looking.</p>
<p>&quot;I should not wonder in the least it that were the bridegroom,&quot;</p>
<p>whispered Ormiston, maliciously.</p>
<p>Sir Norman turned pale with jealousy, and laid his hand on his</p>
<p>sword, with a quick and natural impulse to make the bride a widow</p>
<p>forthwith.  But he checked the desire for an instant as the</p>
<p>brigandish-looking gentleman, after a prolonged stare at the</p>
<p>premises, stepped up to the watchman, who had given them their</p>
<p>information an hour or two before, and who was still at his post.</p>
<p>The friends could not be seen, but they could hear, and they did</p>
<p>so very earnestly indeed.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you tell me, my friend,&quot; began the cloaked unknown, &quot;what</p>
<p>has become of the people residing in yonder house?&quot;</p>
<p>The watchman, held his lamp up to the face of the interlocutor -</p>
<p>a handsome face by the way, what could be seen of it - and</p>
<p>indulged himself in a prolonged survey.</p>
<p>&quot;Well!&quot; said the gentleman, impatiently, &quot;have you no tongue,</p>
<p>fellow?  Where are they, I say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed if I know,&quot; said the watchman.  &quot;I, wasn&#x27;t set here to</p>
<p>keep guard over them was I?  It looks like it, though,&quot; said the</p>
<p>man in parenthesis; &quot;for this makes twice to-night I&#x27;ve been</p>
<p>asked questions about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the gentleman, with a slight start.  &quot;Who asked you</p>
<p>before, pray?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two young gentlemen; lords, I expect, by their dress.  Somebody</p>
<p>ran screaming out of the house, and they wanted to know what was</p>
<p>wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said the stranger, breathlessly, &quot;and then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then, as I couldn&#x27;t tell them they went in to see for</p>
<p>themselves, and shortly after came out with a body wrapped in a</p>
<p>sheet, which they put in a pest-cart going by, and had it buried,</p>
<p>I suppose, with the rest in the plague-pit.&quot;</p>
<p>The stranger fairly staggered back, and caught at s pillar near</p>
<p>for support.  For nearly ten minutes, he stood perfectly</p>
<p>motionless, and then, without a word, started up and walked</p>
<p>rapidly away.  The friends looked after him curiously till he was</p>
<p>out of eight.</p>
<p>&quot;So she is not there,&quot; said Ormiston; &quot;and our mysterious friend</p>
<p>in the cloak is as much at a loss as we are ourselves.  Where</p>
<p>shall we go next - to La Masque or the peat-house?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To La Masque - I hate the idea of the pest-house!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She may be there, nevertheless; and under present circumstances,</p>
<p>it is the beat place for her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t talk of it!&quot; said Sir Norman, impatiently.  &quot;I do not and</p>
<p>will not believe she is there!  If the sorceress shows her to me</p>
<p>in the caldron again, I verily believe I shall jump in head</p>
<p>foremost.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I verily believe we will not find La Masque at home.  She</p>
<p>wanders through the streets at all hours, but particularly</p>
<p>affects the night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We shall try, however.  Come along!&quot;</p>
<p>The house of the sorceress was but a short distance from that of</p>
<p>Sir Norman&#x27;s plague-stricken lady-love&#x27;s; and shod with a sort of</p>
<p>seven-league boots, they soon reached it.  Like the other, it was</p>
<p>all dark and deserted.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the home,&quot; said Ormiston, looking at it doubtfully, &quot;but</p>
<p>where is La Masque?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here!&quot; said a silvery voice at his elbow; and turning round,</p>
<p>they saw a tall, slender figure, cloaked, hooded, and masked.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely, you two do not want me again to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>Both gentlemen doffed their plumed hats, and simultaneously</p>
<p>bowed.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortune favors us,&quot; said Sir Norman.  &quot;Yes, madam, it is even</p>
<p>so; once again to-night we would tax your skill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what do you wish to know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madam, we are in the street.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, I&#x27;m aware of that.  Pray proceed,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you not have the goodness to permit us to enter?&quot; said Sir</p>
<p>Norman, inclined to feel offended.  &quot;How can you tell us what we</p>
<p>wish to know, here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is my secret,&quot; said the sweet voice.  &quot;Probably Sir Norman</p>
<p>Kingsley wishes to know something of the fair lady I showed him</p>
<p>some time ago?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madam, you&#x27;ve guessed it.  It is for that purpose I have sought</p>
<p>you now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you have seen her already?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And love her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With all my heart!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A rapid flame,&quot; said the musical voice, in a tone that had just</p>
<p>a thought of sarcasm; &quot;for one of whose very existence you did</p>
<p>not dream two hours ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame La Masque,&quot; said Norman, flushed sad haughty, &quot;love is</p>
<p>not a question of time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley,&quot; said the lady, somewhat sadly, &quot;I am aware</p>
<p>of that.  Tell me what you wish to know, and if it be in my</p>
<p>power, you shall know it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A thousand thanks!  Tell me, then, is she whom I seek living or</p>
<p>dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is alive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She has the plague?&quot; said Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;I know it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will she recover?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is she now?&quot;</p>
<p>Ls Masque hesitated and seemed uncertain whether or not to reply.</p>
<p>Sir Norman passionately broke in:</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me, madam, for I must know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you shall; but, remember, if you get into danger, you must</p>
<p>not blame me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blame you!  No, I think I would hardly do that.  Where am I to</p>
<p>seek for her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Two miles from London beyond Newgate,&quot; said the mask.  &quot;There</p>
<p>stand the ruins of what was long ago a hunting-lodge, now a</p>
<p>crumbling skeleton, roofless and windowless, and said, by rumor,</p>
<p>to be haunted.  Perhaps you have seen or heard of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen it a hundred times,&quot; broke in Sir Norman.  &quot;Surely,</p>
<p>you do not mean to say she is there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go there, and you will see.  Go there to-night, and lose no time</p>
<ul>
<li>that is, supposing you can procure a license.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;I have one already.  I have a pass from the Lord Mayor to come</p>
<p>and go from the city when I please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good!  Then you&#x27;ll go to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will go.  I might as well do that as anything else, I suppose;</p>
<p>but it is quite impossible,&quot; said Sir Norman, firmly, not to say</p>
<p>obstinately, &quot;that she can be there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well you&#x27;ll see.  You had better go on horseback, if you</p>
<p>desire to be back in time to witness the illumination.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t particularly desire to see the illumination, as I know</p>
<p>of; but I will ride, nevertheless.  What am I to do when I get</p>
<p>there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will enter the ruins, and go on till you discover a spiral</p>
<p>staircase leading to what was once the vaults.  The flags of</p>
<p>these vaults are loose from age, and if you should desire to</p>
<p>remove any of them, you will probably not find it an</p>
<p>impossibility.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why should I desire to remove them?&quot; asked Sir Norman, who felt</p>
<p>dubious, and disappointed, and inclined to be dogmatical.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you may see a glimmering of light - hear strange noises;</p>
<p>and if you remove the stones, may possibly see strange sights.</p>
<p>As I told you before, it is rumored to be haunted, which is true</p>
<p>enough, though not in the way they suspect; and so the fools and</p>
<p>the common herd stay away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if I am discovered peeping like a rascally valet, what will</p>
<p>be the consequences?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very unpleasant ones to you; but you need not be discovered if</p>
<p>you take care.  Ah!  Look there!&quot;</p>
<p>She pointed to the river, and both her companions looked.  A</p>
<p>barge gayly painted and gilded, with a light in prow and stern,</p>
<p>came gliding up among less pretentious craft, and stopped at the</p>
<p>foot of a flight of stairs leading to the bridge.  It contained</p>
<p>four persons - the oarsman, two cavaliers sitting in the stern,</p>
<p>and a lad in the rich livery of a court-page in the act of</p>
<p>springing out.  Nothing very wonderful in all this; and Sir</p>
<p>Norman and Ormiston looked at her for an explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know those two gentlemen?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Sir Norman, promptly; &quot;one is the Duke of</p>
<p>York, the other the Earl of Rochester.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that page, to which of them does he belong?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The page!&quot; said Sir Norman, with a stare, as he leaned forward</p>
<p>to look; &quot;pray, madam, what has the page to do with it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look and see!&quot;</p>
<p>The two peers has ascended the stairs, and were already on the</p>
<p>bridge.  The page loitered behind, talking, as it seemed, to the</p>
<p>waterman.</p>
<p>&quot;He wears the livery of the Earl of Rochester,&quot; said Ormiston,</p>
<p>speaking for the first time, &quot;but I cannot see his face.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He will follow presently, and be sure you see it then!  Possibly</p>
<p>you may not find it entirely new to you.&quot;</p>
<p>She drew back into the shadow as she spoke; and the two nobles,</p>
<p>as they advanced, talking earnestly, beheld Sir Norman and</p>
<p>Ormiston.  Both raised their hats with a look of recognition, and</p>
<p>the salute was courteously returned by the others.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-night, gentlemen,&quot; said Lord Rochester; &quot;a hot evening, is</p>
<p>it not?  Have you come here to witness the illumination?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hardly,&quot; said Sir Norman; &quot;we have come for a very different</p>
<p>purpose, my lord.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The fires will have one good effect,&quot; said Ormiston laughing;</p>
<p>&quot;if they clear the air and drive away this stifling atmosphere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pray God they drive away the plague!&quot; said the Duke of York, as</p>
<p>he and his companion passed from view.</p>
<p>The page sprang up the stairs after them, humming as he came, one</p>
<p>of his master&#x27;s love ditties - songs, saith tradition, savoring</p>
<p>anything but the odor of sanctity.  With the warning of La Masque</p>
<p>fresh in their mind, both looked at him earnestly.  His gay</p>
<p>livery was that of Lord Rochester, and became his graceful figure</p>
<p>well, as he marched along with a jaunty swagger, one hand on his</p>
<p>aide, and the other toying with a beautiful little spaniel, that</p>
<p>frisked in open violation of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s orders, commanding</p>
<p>all dogs, great and small, to be put to death as propagators of</p>
<p>the pestilence.  In passing, the lad turned his face toward them</p>
<p>for a moment - a bright, saucy, handsome face it was - and the</p>
<p>next instant he went round an angle and disappeared.  Ormiston</p>
<p>suppressed an oath.  Sir Norman stifled a cry of amazement - for</p>
<p>both recognized that beautiful colorless face, those perfect</p>
<p>features, and great, black, lustrous eyes.  It was the face of</p>
<p>the lady they had saved from the plague-pit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I sane or mad?&quot; inquired Sir Norman, looking helplessly about</p>
<p>him for information.  Surely that is she we are in search of.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It certainly is!&quot; said Ormiston.  &quot;Where are the wonders of this</p>
<p>night to end?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Satan and La Masque only know; for they both seem to have united</p>
<p>to drive me mad.  Where is she?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where, indeed?&quot; said Ormiston; &quot;where is last year&#x27;s snow?&quot;  And</p>
<p>Sir Norman, looking round at the spot where she had stood a</p>
<p>moment before, found that she, too, had disappeared.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>THE STRANGER.</p>
<p>The two friends looked at each other in impressive silence for a</p>
<p>moment, and spake never a word.  Not that they were astonished -</p>
<p>they were long past the power of that emotion:  and if a cloud</p>
<p>had dropped from the sky at their feet, they would probably have</p>
<p>looked at it passively, and vaguely wonder if the rest would</p>
<p>follow.  Sir Norman, especially, had sank into a state of mind</p>
<p>that words are faint and feeble to describe.  Ormiston, not being</p>
<p>quite so far gone, was the first to open his lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Upon my honor, Sir Norman, this is the most astonishing thing</p>
<p>ever I heard of.  That certainly was the face of our half-dead</p>
<p>bride! What, in the name ad all the gods, can it mean, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have given up wondering,&quot; said Sir Norman, in the same</p>
<p>helpless tone.  &quot;And if the earth was to open and swallow London</p>
<p>up, I should not be the least surprised.  One thing is certain:</p>
<p>the lady we are seeking and that page are one and the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet La Masque told you she was two miles from the city, in</p>
<p>the haunted ruin; and La Masque most assuredly knows.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt she is there.  I shall not be the least</p>
<p>astonished if I find her in every street between this and</p>
<p>Newgate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really, it is a most singular affair!  First you see her in the</p>
<p>magic caldron; then we find her dead; then, when within an ace of</p>
<p>being buried, she comes to life; then we leave her lifeless as a</p>
<p>marble statue, shut up in your room, and fifteen minutes after,</p>
<p>she vanishes as mysteriously as a fairy in a nursery legend.</p>
<p>And, lastly, she turns up in the shape of a court-page, and</p>
<p>swaggers along London Bridge at this hour of the night, chanting</p>
<p>a love song.  Faith! it would puzzle the sphinx herself to read</p>
<p>this riddle, I&#x27;ve a notion!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I, for one, shall never try to read it,&quot; said Sir Norman.  &quot;I am</p>
<p>about tired of this labyrinth of mysteries, and shall save time</p>
<p>and La Masque to unravel them at their leisure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you mean to give up the pursuit?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not exactly.  I love this mysterious beauty too well to do that;</p>
<p>and when next I find her, be it where it may, I shall take care</p>
<p>she does not slip so easily through my fingers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot forget that page,&quot; said Ormiston, musingly.  &quot;It is</p>
<p>singular, since, he wears the Earl of Rochester&#x27;s livery, that we</p>
<p>have never seen him before among his followers.  Are you quite</p>
<p>sure, Sir Norman, that you have not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Seen him?  Don&#x27;t be absurd, Ormiston!  Do you think I could ever</p>
<p>forget such a face as that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would not be easy, I confess.  One does not see such every</p>
<p>day.  And yet - and yet - it is most extraordinary!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall ask Rochester about him the first thing to-morrow; and</p>
<p>unless he is an optical illusion - which I vow I half believe is</p>
<p>the case - I will come at the truth in spite of your demoniac</p>
<p>friend, La Masque!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you do not mean to look for him to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look for him?  I might as well look for a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>No!  I have promised La Masque to visit the old ruins, and there</p>
<p>I shall go forthwith.  Will you accompany me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think not.  I have a word to say to La, Masque, and you and</p>
<p>she kept talking so busily, I had no chance to put it in.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, I have no doubt it is a word you would not like to</p>
<p>utter in the presence of a third party, even though that third</p>
<p>party be your friend and Pythias, Kingsley.  Do you mean to stay</p>
<p>here like a plague-sentinel until she returns?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Possibly; or if I get tired I may set out in search of her.</p>
<p>When do you return?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Fates, that seem to make a foot-ball of my best affections,</p>
<p>and kick them as they please, only know.  If nothing happens -</p>
<p>which, being interpreted, means, if I am still in the land of the</p>
<p>living - I shall surely be back by daybreak.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I shall be anxious about that time to hear the result of</p>
<p>your night&#x27;s adventure; so where shall we meet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not here?  it is as good a place an any.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With all my heart.  Where do you propose getting a horse?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the King&#x27;s Arms - but a stones throw from here.  Farewell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-night, and God speed you!&quot; said Ormiston.  And wrapping his</p>
<p>cloak close about him, he leaned against the doorway, and,</p>
<p>watching the dancing lights on the river, prepared to await the</p>
<p>return of La Masque.</p>
<p>With his head full of the adventures and misadventures of the</p>
<p>night, Sir Norman walked thoughtfully on until he reached the</p>
<p>King&#x27;s Arms - a low inn on the bank of the river.  To his dismay</p>
<p>he found the house shut up, and bearing the dismal mark and</p>
<p>inscription of the pestilence.  While he stood contemplating it</p>
<p>in perplexity, a watchman, on guard before another plague-</p>
<p>stricken house, advanced and informed him that the whole family</p>
<p>had perished of the disease, and that the landlord himself, the</p>
<p>last survivor, had been carried off not twenty minutes before to</p>
<p>the plague-pit.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; added the man, seeing Sir Norman&#x27;s look of annoyance, and</p>
<p>being informed what he wanted, &quot;there are two or three horses</p>
<p>around there in the stable, and you may as well help yourself,</p>
<p>for if you don&#x27;t take them, somebody else will.&quot;</p>
<p>This philosophic logic struck Sir Norman as being so extremely</p>
<p>reasonable, that without more ado he stepped round to the stables</p>
<p>and selected the best it contained.  Before proceeding on his</p>
<p>journey, it occurred to him that, having been handling a plague-</p>
<p>patient, it would be a good thing to get his clothes fumigated;</p>
<p>so he stepped into an apothecary&#x27;s store for that purpose, and</p>
<p>provided himself also with a bottle of aromatic vinegar.  Thus</p>
<p>prepared for the worst, Sir Norman sprang on his horse like a</p>
<p>second Don Quixote striding his good steed Rozinante, and sallied</p>
<p>forth in quest of adventures.  These, for a short time, were of</p>
<p>rather a dismal character; for, hearing the noise of a horse&#x27;s</p>
<p>hoofs in the silent streets at that hour of the night, the people</p>
<p>opened their doors as he passed by, thinking it the pest-cart,</p>
<p>and brought forth many a miserable victim of the pestilence.</p>
<p>Averting his head from the revolting spectacles, Sir Norman held</p>
<p>the bottle of vinegar to his nostrils, and rode rapidly till he</p>
<p>reached Newgate.  There he was stopped until his bill of health</p>
<p>was examined, and that small manuscript being found all right, he</p>
<p>was permitted to pass on in peace.  Everywhere he went, the trail</p>
<p>of the serpent was visible over all.  Death and Desolation went</p>
<p>hand in hand.  Outside as well as inside the gates, great piles</p>
<p>of wood and coal were arranged, waiting only the midnight hour to</p>
<p>be fired.  Here, however, no one seemed to be stirring; and no</p>
<p>sound broke the silence but the distant rumble of the death-cart,</p>
<p>and the ringing of the driver&#x27;s bell.  There were lights in some</p>
<p>of the houses, but many of them were dark and deserted, and</p>
<p>nearly every one bore the red cross of the plague.</p>
<p>It was a gloomy scene and hour, and Sir Norman&#x27;s heart turned</p>
<p>sick within him as he noticed tho ruin and devastation the</p>
<p>pestilence had everywhere wrought.  And he remembered, with a</p>
<p>shudder, the prediction of Lilly, the astrologer, that the paved</p>
<p>streets of London would be like green fields, and the living be</p>
<p>no longer able to bury the dead.  Long before this, he had grown</p>
<p>hardened and accustomed to death from its very frequence; but</p>
<p>now, as he looked round him, he almost resolved to ride on and</p>
<p>return no more to London till the plague should have left it.</p>
<p>But then came the thought of his unknown lady-love, and with it</p>
<p>the reflection that he was on his way to find her; and, rousing</p>
<p>himself from his melancholy reverie, he rode on at a brisker</p>
<p>pace, heroically resolved to brave the plague or any other</p>
<p>emergency, for her sake.  Full of this laudable and lover-like</p>
<p>resolution, he had got on about half a mile further, when he was</p>
<p>suddenly checked in his rapid career by an exciting, but in no</p>
<p>way surprising, little incident.</p>
<p>During the last few yards, Sir Norman had come within sight of</p>
<p>another horseman, riding on at rather a leisurely pace,</p>
<p>considering the place and the hour.  Suddenly three other</p>
<p>horsemen came galloping down upon him, and the leader presenting</p>
<p>a pistol at his head, requested him in a stentorial voice for his</p>
<p>money or his life.  By way of reply, the stranger instantly</p>
<p>produced a pistol of his own, and before the astonished</p>
<p>highwayman could comprehend the possibility of such an act,</p>
<p>discharged it full in his face.  With a loud yell the robber</p>
<p>reeled and fell from his saddle, and in a twinkling both his</p>
<p>companions fired their pistols at the traveler, and bore, with a</p>
<p>simultaneous cry of rage, down upon him.  Neither of the shots</p>
<p>had taken effect, but the two enraged highwaymen would have made</p>
<p>short work of their victim had not Sir Norman, like a true</p>
<p>knight, ridden to the rescue.  Drawing his sword, with one</p>
<p>vigorous blow he placed another of the assassins hors de combat;</p>
<p>and, delighted with the idea of a fight to stir his stagnant</p>
<p>blood, was turning (like a second St. George at the Dragon), upon</p>
<p>the other, when that individual, thinking discretion the better</p>
<p>part of valor, instantaneously turned tail and fled.  The whole</p>
<p>brisk little episode had not occupied five minutes, and Sir</p>
<p>Norman was scarcely aware the fight had began before it had</p>
<p>triumphantly ended.</p>
<p>&quot;Short, sharp, and decisive!&quot; was the stranger&#x27;s cool criticism,</p>
<p>as he deliberately wiped his blood=stained sword, and placed it</p>
<p>in a velvet scabbard.  &quot;Our friends, there, got more than they</p>
<p>bargained for, I fancy.  Though, but for you, Sir,&quot; he said,</p>
<p>politely raising him hat and bowing, &quot;I should probably have been</p>
<p>ere this in heaven, or - the other place.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman, deeply edified by the easy sang-froid of the speaker,</p>
<p>turned to take a second look at him.  There was very little</p>
<p>light; for the night had grown darker as it wore on, and the few</p>
<p>stars that had glimmered faintly had hid their diminished heads</p>
<p>behind the piles of inky clouds.  Still, there was a sort of</p>
<p>faint phosphorescent light whitening the gloom, and by it Sir</p>
<p>Norman&#x27;s keen bright eyes discovered that he wore a long dark</p>
<p>cloak and slouched hat.  He discovered something else, too - that</p>
<p>he had seen that hat and cloak, and the man inside of them on</p>
<p>London Bridge, not an hour before.  It struck Sir Norman there</p>
<p>was a sort of fatality in their meeting; and his pulses quickened</p>
<p>a trifle, as he thought that he might be speaking to the husband</p>
<p>of the lady for whom he had so suddenly conceived such a rash and</p>
<p>inordinate attachment.  That personage meantime having reloaded</p>
<p>his pistol, with a self-possession refreshing to witness,</p>
<p>replaced it in his doublet, gathered up the reins, and, glancing</p>
<p>slightly at his companion, spoke again</p>
<p>&quot;I should thank you for saving my life, I suppose, but thanking</p>
<p>people is so little in my line, that I scarcely know how to set</p>
<p>about it.  Perhaps, my dear sir, you will take the will for the</p>
<p>deed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An original, this,&quot; thought Sir Norman,&quot;whoever he is.&quot; Then</p>
<p>aloud: &quot;Pray don&#x27;t trouble yourself about thanks, sir, I should</p>
<p>have dome precisely the same for the highwaymen, had you been</p>
<p>three to one over them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t doubt it in the least; nevertheless I feel grateful, for</p>
<p>you have saved my life all the same, and you have never seen me</p>
<p>before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There you are mistaken,&quot; said Sir Norman, quietly &quot;I had the</p>
<p>pleasure of seeing you scarce an hour ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the stranger, in an altered tone, &quot;and where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On London Bridge.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not see you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very likely, but I was there none the less.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know me?&quot; said the stranger; and Sir Norman could see he</p>
<p>was gazing at him sharply from under the shadow of his slouched</p>
<p>hat.</p>
<p>&quot;I have not that honor, but I hope to do so before we part.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was quite dark when you saw me on the bridge - how comes it,</p>
<p>then, that you recollect me so well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have always been blessed with an excellent memory,&quot; said Sir</p>
<p>Norman carelessly, &quot;and I knew your dress, face, and voice</p>
<p>instantly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My voice!  Then you heard me speak, probably to the watchman</p>
<p>guarding a plague-stricken house?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly! and the subject being a very interesting one, I</p>
<p>listened to all you said.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed I and what possible interest could; the subject have for</p>
<p>you, may I ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A deeper one than you think!&quot; said Sir Norman, with a slight</p>
<p>tremor in his voice as he thought of the lady, &quot;the watchman told</p>
<p>you the lady you sought for had been carried away dead, and</p>
<p>thrown into the plague-pit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; cried the stranger starting violently, &quot;and was it not</p>
<p>true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only partly.  She was carried away in the pest-cart sure enough,</p>
<p>but she was not thrown into the plague-pit!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because, when on reaching that horrible spot, she was found to</p>
<p>be alive!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good Heaven!  And what then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then,&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, in a tone almost as excited as his</p>
<p>own, &quot;she was brought to the house of a friend, and left alone</p>
<p>for a few minutes, while that friend went in search of a doctor.</p>
<p>On returning they found her - where do you think?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gone!&quot; said Sir Norman emphatically, &quot;spirited away by some</p>
<p>mysterious agency; for she was dying of the plague, and could not</p>
<p>possibly stir hand or foot herself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dying of the plague, O Leoline!&quot; said the stranger, in a voice</p>
<p>full of pity and horror, while for a moment he covered his face</p>
<p>with his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;So her name is Leoline?&quot; said Sir Norman to himself.  &quot;I have</p>
<p>found that out, and also that this gentleman, whatever he may be</p>
<p>to her, is as ignorant of her whereabouts as I am myself.  He</p>
<p>seems in trouble, too.  I wonder if he really happens to be her</p>
<p>husband?&quot;</p>
<p>The stranger suddenly lifted his head and favored Sir Norman with</p>
<p>a long and searching look.</p>
<p>&quot;How come you to know all this, Sir Norman Kingsley,&quot; he asked</p>
<p>abruptly.</p>
<p>&quot;And how come you to know my name?&quot; demanded Sir Norman, very</p>
<p>much amazed, notwithstanding his assertion that nothing would</p>
<p>astonish him more.</p>
<p>&quot;That is of no consequence!  Tell me how you&#x27;ve learned all</p>
<p>this?&quot; repeated the stranger, in a tone of almost stern</p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>Sir Norman started and stared.  That voice I have had heard it a</p>
<p>thousand times!  It had evidently been disguised before; but now,</p>
<p>in the excitement of the moment, the stranger was thrown off his</p>
<p>guard, and it became perfectly familiar.  But where had he heard</p>
<p>it?   For the life of him, Sir Norman could not tell, yet it was</p>
<p>as well known to him as his own.  It had the tone, too, of one</p>
<p>far more used to command than entreaty; and Sir Norman, instead</p>
<p>of getting angry, us he felt he ought to have done, mechanically</p>
<p>answered:</p>
<p>&quot;The watchman told you of the two young men who brought her out</p>
<p>and laid her in the dead-cart - I was one of the two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who was the other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A friend of mine - one Malcolm Ormiston.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!  I know him!  Pardon my abruptness, Sir Norman,&quot; said the</p>
<p>stranger, once more speaking in his assumed suave tone, &quot;but I</p>
<p>feel deeply on this subject, and was excited at the moment.  You</p>
<p>spoke of her being brought to the house of a friend - now, who</p>
<p>may that friend be, for I was not aware that she had any?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I judged,&quot; said Sir Norman, rather bitterly, or she would not</p>
<p>have been left to die alone of the plague.  She was brought to my</p>
<p>house, sir, and I am the friend who would have stood by her to</p>
<p>the last!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman sat up very straight and haughty on his horse; and had</p>
<p>it been daylight, he would have seen a slight derisive smile pass</p>
<p>over the lips of his companion.</p>
<p>&quot;I have always heard that Sir Norman Kingsley was a chivalrous</p>
<p>knight,&quot; he said; &quot;but I scarcely dreamed his gallantry would</p>
<p>have carried him go far as to brave death by the pestilence for</p>
<p>the sake of an unknown lady - however beautiful.  I wonder you,</p>
<p>did not carry her to the pest-house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No doubt!  Those who could desert her at such a time would</p>
<p>probably be capable of that or any other baseness!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My good friend,&quot; said the stranger, calmly, &quot;your insinuation is</p>
<p>not over-courteous, but I can forgive it, more for the sake of</p>
<p>what you&#x27;ve done for her to-night than for myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman&#x27;s lip curled.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m obliged to you!  And now, sir, as you have seen fit to</p>
<p>question me in this free and easy manner, will you pardon me if I</p>
<p>take the liberty of returning the compliment, and ask you a few</p>
<p>in return?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly; pray proceed, Sir Norman,&quot; said the stranger,</p>
<p>blandly; &quot;you are at liberty to ask as many questions as you</p>
<p>please - so am I to answer them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I answered all yours unhesitatingly, and you owe it to me to do</p>
<p>the same,&quot; said Sir Norman, somewhat haughtily. &quot;In the first</p>
<p>place, you have an advantage of me which I neither understand,</p>
<p>nor relish; so, to place us on equal terms, will you have the</p>
<p>goodness to tell me your name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most assuredly!  My name,&quot; said the stranger, with glib</p>
<p>airiness, &quot;is Count L&#x27;Estrange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A name unknown to me,&quot; said Sir Norman, with a piercing look,</p>
<p>&quot;and equally unknown, I believe, at Whitehall.  There is a Lord</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange in London; or you and he are certainly not one and the</p>
<p>same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My friend does not believe me,&quot; said the count, almost gayly -</p>
<p>&quot;a circumstance I regret, but cannot help.  Is there anything</p>
<p>else Sir Norman wishes to know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you do not answer my questions truthfully, there to little</p>
<p>use in my asking them,&quot; said Sir Norman, bluntly.  &quot;Do you mean</p>
<p>to say you are a foreigner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley is at perfect liberty to answer that</p>
<p>question as he pleases,&quot; replied the stranger, with most</p>
<p>provoking indifference.</p>
<p>Sir Norman&#x27;s eye flashed, and his hand fell on his sword; but,</p>
<p>reflecting that the count might find it inconvenient to answer</p>
<p>any more questions if he ran him through, he restrained himself</p>
<p>and went on.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, you are impertinent, but that is of no consequence, just</p>
<p>now.  Who was that lady - what was her name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>Was she your wife?&quot;</p>
<p>The stranger paused for a moment, as if reflecting whether she</p>
<p>was or not, and then said, meditatively</p>
<p>&quot;No - I don&#x27;t know as she was.  On the whole, I am pretty sure</p>
<p>she was not.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman felt as if a ton weight had been suddenly hoisted from</p>
<p>the region of his heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Was she anybody else&#x27;s wife?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think not.  I&#x27;m inclined to think that, except myself, she did</p>
<p>not know another man in London.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why was she dressed as a bride?&quot; inquired Sir Norman,</p>
<p>rather mystified.</p>
<p>&quot;Was she?  My poor Leoline!&quot; said the stranger, sadly.  &quot;Because</p>
<p>-&quot; he hesitated, &quot;because - in short, Sir Norman,&quot; said the</p>
<p>stranger, decidedly, &quot;I decline answering any more questions!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall find out, for all that,&quot; said Sir Norman, &quot;and here I</p>
<p>shall bid you good-night, for this by-path leads to my</p>
<p>destination.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-night,&quot; said the stranger, &quot;and be careful, Sir</p>
<p>Norman-remember, the plague is abroad.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so are highwaymen!&quot; called Sir Norman after him, a little</p>
<p>maliciously; but a careless laugh from the stranger was the only</p>
<p>reply as he galloped away.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>THE DWARF AND THE RUIN.</p>
<p>The by-path down which Sir Norman rode, led to an inn, &quot;The</p>
<p>Golden Crown,&quot; about a quarter of a mile from the ruin.  Not</p>
<p>wishing to take his horse, lest it should lead to discovery, he</p>
<p>proposed leaving it here till his return; and, with this</p>
<p>intention, and the strong desire for a glass of wine - for the</p>
<p>heat and his ride made him extremely thirsty - he dismounted at</p>
<p>the door, and consigning the animal to the care of a hostler, he</p>
<p>entered the bar-room.  It was not the most inviting place in the</p>
<p>world, this same bar-room - being illy-lighted, dim with</p>
<p>tobacco-smoke, and pervaded by a strong spirituous essence of</p>
<p>stronger drinks than malt or cold water.  A number of men were</p>
<p>loitering about, smoking, drinking, and discussing the</p>
<p>all-absorbing topic of the plague, and the fires that might be</p>
<p>kindled.  There was a moment&#x27;s pause, as Sir Norman entered, took</p>
<p>a seat, and called for a glass of sack, and then the conversation</p>
<p>went on as before.  The landlord hastened to supply his wants by</p>
<p>placing a glass and a bottle of wine before him, and Sir Norman</p>
<p>fell to helping himself, and to ruminating deeply on the events</p>
<p>of the night.  Rather melancholy these ruminations were, though</p>
<p>to do the young gentleman justice, sentimental melancholy was not</p>
<p>at all in his line; but then you will please to recollect he was</p>
<p>in love, and when people come to that state, they are no longer</p>
<p>to be held responsible either for their thoughts or actions.  It</p>
<p>is true his attack had been a rapid one, but it was no less</p>
<p>severe for that; and if any evil-minded critic is disposed to</p>
<p>sneer at the suddenness of his disorder, I have only to say, that</p>
<p>I know from observation, not to speak of experience, that love at</p>
<p>first sight is a lamentable fact, and no myth.</p>
<p>Love is not a plant that requires time to flourish, but is quite</p>
<p>capable of springing up like the gourd of Jonah full grown in a</p>
<p>moment.  Our young friend, Sir Norman, had not been aware of the</p>
<p>existence of the object of his affections for a much longer space</p>
<p>than two hours and a half, yet he had already got to such a</p>
<p>pitch, that if he did not speedily find her, he felt he would do</p>
<p>something so desperate as to shake society to its utmost</p>
<p>foundations.  The very mystery of the affair spurred him on, and</p>
<p>the romantic way in which she had been found, saved, and</p>
<p>disappeared, threw such a halo of interest round her, that he was</p>
<p>inclined to think sometimes she was nothing but a shining vision</p>
<p>from another world.  Those dark, splendid eyes; that lovely</p>
<p>marblelike face; those wavy ebon tresses; that exquisitely</p>
<p>exquisite figure; yes, he felt they were all a great deal too</p>
<p>perfect for this imperfect and wicked world.  Six Norman was in a</p>
<p>very bad way, beyond doubt, but no worse than millions of young</p>
<p>men before and after him; and he heaved a great many profound</p>
<p>sighs, and drank a great many glasses of sack, and came to the</p>
<p>sorrowful conclusion that Dame Fortune was a malicious jade,</p>
<p>inclined to poke fun at his best affections, and make a</p>
<p>shuttlecock of his heart for the rest of his life.  He thought,</p>
<p>too, of Count L&#x27;Estrange; and the longer he thought, the more he</p>
<p>became convinced that he knew him well, and had met him often.</p>
<p>But where?  He racked his brain until, between love, Leoline, and</p>
<p>the count, he got that delicate organ into such a maze of</p>
<p>bewilderment and distraction, that he felt he would be a case of</p>
<p>congestion, shortly, if he did not give it up.  That the count&#x27;s</p>
<p>voice was not the only thing about him assumed, he was positive;</p>
<p>and he mentally called over the muster-roll of his past friends,</p>
<p>who spent half their time at Whitehall, and the other half going</p>
<p>through the streets, making love to the honest citizens&#x27; pretty</p>
<p>wives and daughters; but none of them answered to Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange.  He could scarcely be a foreigner - he spoke English</p>
<p>with too perfect an accent to be that; and then he knew him, Sir</p>
<p>Norman, as if he had been his brother.  In short, there was no</p>
<p>use driving himself insane trying to read so unreadable a riddle;</p>
<p>and inwardly consigning the mysterious count to Old Nick, he</p>
<p>swallowed another glass of sack, and quit thinking about him.</p>
<p>So absorbed had Sir Norman been in his own mournful musings, that</p>
<p>he paid no attention whatever to those around him, and had nearly</p>
<p>forgotten their very presence, when one of them, with aloud cry,</p>
<p>sprang to his feet, and then fell writhing to the floor.  The</p>
<p>others, in dismay, gathered abut him, but the ne=t instant fell</p>
<p>back with a cry of, &quot;He has the plague!&quot;  At that dreaded</p>
<p>announcement, half of them scampered off incontinently; and the</p>
<p>other half with the landlord at their head, lifted the sufferer</p>
<p>whose groans and cries were heart-rendering, and carried him out</p>
<p>of the house.  Sir Norman, rather dismayed himself, had risen to</p>
<p>his feet, fully aroused from his reverie, and found himself and</p>
<p>another individual sole possessors of the premises.  His</p>
<p>companion he could not very well make out; for he was sitting, or</p>
<p>rather crouching, in a remote and shadowy corner, where nothing</p>
<p>was clearly visible but the glare of a pair of fiery eyes.  There</p>
<p>was a great redundancy of hair, too, about his head and face,</p>
<p>indeed considerable more about the latter than there seemed any</p>
<p>real necessity for, and even with the imperfect glimpse he caught</p>
<p>of him the young man set him down in his own mind as about as</p>
<p>hard-looking a customer as he had ever seen.  The fiery eyes were</p>
<p>glaring upon him like those of a tiger, through a jungle of bushy</p>
<p>hair, but their owner spoke never a word, though the other stared</p>
<p>back with compound interest.  There they sat, beaming upon each</p>
<p>other - one fiercely, the other curiously, until the</p>
<p>re-appearance of the landlord with a very lugubrious and</p>
<p>woebegone countenance.  It struck Sir Norman that it was about</p>
<p>time to start for the ruin; and, with an eye to business, he</p>
<p>turned to cross-examine mine host a trifle.</p>
<p>&quot;What have they done with that man?&quot; he asked by way of preface.</p>
<p>&quot;Sent him to the pest-house,&quot; replied the landlord, resting his</p>
<p>elbows on the counter and his chin in his hands, and staring</p>
<p>dismally at the opposite wall.  &quot;Ah!  Lord &#x27;a&#x27; mercy on us I</p>
<p>these be dreadful times!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dreadful enough!&quot; said Sir Norman, sighing deeply, as he thought</p>
<p>of his beautiful Leoline, a victim of the merciless pestilence.</p>
<p>&quot;Have there been many deaths here of the distemper?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twenty-five to-day!&quot; groaned the man. &quot;Lord! what will become of</p>
<p>us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You seem rather disheartened,&quot; said Sir Norman, pouring out a</p>
<p>glass of wine and handing it to him.  Just drink this, and don&#x27;t</p>
<p>borrow trouble.  They say sack is a sure specific against the</p>
<p>plague.&quot;</p>
<p>Mine host drained the bumper, and wiped his mouth, with another</p>
<p>hollow groan.</p>
<p>&quot;If I thought that, sir, I&#x27;d not be sober from one week&#x27;s end to</p>
<p>t&#x27;other; but I know well enough I will be in a plague-pit in less</p>
<p>than a week.  O Lord! have mercy on us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Amen!&quot; said Sir Norman, impatiently.  &quot;If fear has not taken</p>
<p>away your wits, my good sir, will you tell me what old ruin that</p>
<p>is I saw a little above here as I rode up?&quot;</p>
<p>The man started from his trance of terror, and glanced, first at</p>
<p>the fiery eyes in the corner, and then at Sir Norman, in evident</p>
<p>trepidation of the question.</p>
<p>&quot;That ruin, sir?  You must be a stranger in this place, surely,</p>
<p>or you would not need to ask that question.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, suppose I am a stranger?  What then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, sir; only I thought everybody knew everything about</p>
<p>that ruin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I do not, you see?  So fill your glass again, and while you</p>
<p>are drinking it, just tell me what that everything comprises.&quot;</p>
<p>Again the landlord glanced fearfully st the fiery eyes in the</p>
<p>corner, and again hesitated.</p>
<p>&quot;Well!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, at once surprised and impatient at</p>
<p>his taciturnity, &quot;Can&#x27;t you speak man?  I want you to tell me all</p>
<p>about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing to tell, sir,&quot; replied the host, goaded to</p>
<p>desperation.  &quot;It is an old, deserted ruin that&#x27;s been here ever</p>
<p>since I remember; and that&#x27;s all I know about it.&quot;</p>
<p>While, he spoke, the crouching shape in the corner reared itself</p>
<p>upright, and keeping his fiery eyes still glaring upon Sir</p>
<p>Norman, advanced into the light.  Our young knight was in the act</p>
<p>of raising his glass to his lips; but as the apparition</p>
<p>approached, he laid it down again, untasted, and stared at it in</p>
<p>the wildest surprise and intensest curiosity.  Truly, it was a</p>
<p>singular-looking creature, not to say a rather startling one.  A</p>
<p>dwarf of some.  four feet high, and at least five feet broad</p>
<p>across the shoulders, with immense arms and head - a giant in</p>
<p>everything but height.  His immense skull was set on such a</p>
<p>trifle of a neck as to be scarcely worth mentioning, and was</p>
<p>garnished by a violent mat of coarse, black hair, which also</p>
<p>overran the territory of his cheeks and chin, leaving no neutral</p>
<p>ground but his two fiery eyes and a broken nose all twisted awry.</p>
<p>On a pair of short, stout legs he wore immense jack-boots, his</p>
<p>Herculean shoulders and chest were adorned with a leathern</p>
<p>doublet, and in the belt round his waist were conspicuously stuck</p>
<p>a pair of pistols and a dagger.  Altogether, a more ugly or</p>
<p>sinister gentleman of his inches it would have been hard to find</p>
<p>in all broad England.  Stopping deliberately before Sir Norman,</p>
<p>he placed a hand on each hip, and in a deep, guttural voice,</p>
<p>addressed him:</p>
<p>&quot;So, sir knight - for such I perceive you are - you are anxious</p>
<p>to know something of that old ruin yonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Sir Norman, so far recovering from his surprise as</p>
<p>to be able to speak, &quot;suppose I am?  Have you anything to say</p>
<p>against it, my little friend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, not in the least!&quot; said the dwarf, with a hoarse chuckle.</p>
<p>Only, instead of wasting your breath asking this good man, who</p>
<p>professes such utter ignorance, you had better apply to me for</p>
<p>information.&quot;</p>
<p>Again Sir Norman surveyed the little Hercules from head to foot</p>
<p>for a moment, in silence, as one, nowadays, would an intelligent</p>
<p>gorilla.</p>
<p>&quot;You think so - do you?  And what may you happen to know about</p>
<p>it, my pretty little friend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O Lord!&quot; exclaimed the landlord, to himself, with a frightened</p>
<p>face, while the dwarf &quot;grinned horribly a ghastly smile&quot; from ear</p>
<p>to ear.</p>
<p>&quot;So much, my good sir, that I would strongly advise you not to go</p>
<p>near it, unless you wish to catch something worse than the</p>
<p>plague.  There have been others - our worthy host, there, whose</p>
<p>teeth, you may perceive, are chattering in his head, can tell you</p>
<p>about those that have tried the trick, and - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said Sir Norman, curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;And have never returned to tell what they found!&quot; concluded the</p>
<p>little monster, with a diabolical leer.  And as the landlord</p>
<p>fell, gray and gasping, back in his seat, he broke out into a</p>
<p>loud and hyena-like laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear little friend,&quot; said Sir Norman, staring at him in</p>
<p>displeased wonder, &quot;don&#x27;t laugh, if you can help it.  You are</p>
<p>unprepossessing enough at best, but when you laugh, you look like</p>
<p>the very (a downward gesture) himself!&quot;</p>
<p>Unheeding this advice, the dwarf broke again into an unearthly</p>
<p>cachinnation, that frightened the landlord nearly into fits, and</p>
<p>seriously discomposed the nervous system even of Sir Norman</p>
<p>himself.  Then, grinning like a baboon, and still transfixing our</p>
<p>puissant young knight with the same tiger-like and unpleasant</p>
<p>glare, he nodded a farewell; and in this fashion, grinning, and</p>
<p>nodding, and backing, he got to the door, and concluding the</p>
<p>interesting performance with a third hoarse and hideous laugh,</p>
<p>disappeared in the darkness.</p>
<p>For fully ten minutes after he was gone, the young man kept his</p>
<p>eyes blankly fixed on the door, with a vague impression that he</p>
<p>was suffering from an attack of nightmare; for it seemed</p>
<p>impossible that anything so preposterously ugly as that dwarf</p>
<p>could exist out of one.  A deep groan from the landlord, however,</p>
<p>convinced him that it was no disagreeable midnight vision, but a</p>
<p>brawny reality; and turning to that individual, he found him</p>
<p>gasping, in the last degree of terror, behind the counter.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, who in the name of all the demons oat of Hades may that</p>
<p>ugly abortion be?&quot; inquired Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;O Lord I be merciful! sir, it&#x27;s Caliban; and the only wonder is,</p>
<p>he did not leave you a bleeding corpse at his feet!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should like to see him try it.  Perhaps he would have found</p>
<p>that is a game two can play at!  Where does he come from and who</p>
<p>is he!&quot;</p>
<p>The landlord leaned over the counter, and placed a very pale and</p>
<p>startled face close to Sir Norman&#x27;s.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s just what I wanted to tell you, sir, but I was afraid to</p>
<p>speak before him.  I think he lives up in that same old ruin you</p>
<p>were inquiring about - at least, he is often seen hanging around</p>
<p>there; but people are too much afraid of him to ask him any</p>
<p>questions.  Ah, sir, it&#x27;s a strange place, that ruin, and there</p>
<p>be strange stories afloat about it,&quot; said the man, with a</p>
<p>portentious shake of the head.</p>
<p>&quot;What are they?&quot; inquired Sir Norman.  &quot;I should particularly</p>
<p>like to know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, sir, for one thing, some folks say it is haunted, on</p>
<p>account of the queer lights and noises abort it, sometimes; but,</p>
<p>again, there be other folks, sir, that say the ghosts are alive,</p>
<p>and that he&quot; - nodding toward the door - &quot;is a sort of ringleader</p>
<p>among them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who are they that out up such cantrips in the old place,</p>
<p>pray?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord only knows, sir.  I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t.  I never go near it</p>
<p>myself; but there are others who have, and some of them tell of</p>
<p>the most beautiful lady, all in white, with long, black hair, who</p>
<p>walks on the battlements moonlight nights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A beautiful lady, all in white, with long, black hair!  Why,</p>
<p>that description applies to Leoline exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>And Sir Norman gave a violent start, and arose to proceed to the</p>
<p>place directly.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you go near it, sir!&quot; said the host, warningly.  &quot;Others</p>
<p>have gone, as he told you, and never come back; for these be</p>
<p>dreadful times, and men do as they please.  Between the plague</p>
<p>and their wickedness, the Lord only known what will become of</p>
<p>us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I should return here for my horse in an hour or two, I</p>
<p>suppose I can get him?&quot; sad Sir Norman, as he turned toward the</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s likely you can, sir, if I&#x27;m not dead by that time,&quot; said</p>
<p>the landlord, as he sank down again, groaning dismally, with his</p>
<p>chin between his hands.</p>
<p>The night was now profoundly dark; but Sir Norman knew the road</p>
<p>and ruin well, and, drawing his sword, walked resolutely on.  The</p>
<p>distance between it and the ruin was trifling, and in less than</p>
<p>ten minutes it loomed up before him, a mass of deeper black in</p>
<p>the blackness.  No white vision floated on the broken battlements</p>
<p>this night, as Sir Norman looked wistfully up at them; but</p>
<p>neither was there any ungainly dwarf, with two-edged sword,</p>
<p>guarding the ruined entrance; and Sir Norman passed unmolested</p>
<p>in.  He sought the spiral staircase which La Masque had spoken</p>
<p>of, and, passing carefully from one ancient chamber to another,</p>
<p>stumbling over piles of rubbish and stones as he went, he reached</p>
<p>it at last.  Descending gingerly its tortuous steepness, he found</p>
<p>himself in the mouldering vaults, and, as he trod them, his ear</p>
<p>was greeted by the sound of faint and far-off music.  Proceeding</p>
<p>farther, he heard distinctly, mingled with it, a murmur of voices</p>
<p>and laughter, and, through the chinks in the broken flags, he</p>
<p>perceived a few faint rays of light.  Remembering the directions</p>
<p>of La Masque, and feeling intensely curious, he cautiously knelt</p>
<p>down, and examined the loose flagstones until he found one he</p>
<p>could raise; he pushed it partly aside, and, lying flat on the</p>
<p>stones, with his face to the aperture, Sir Norman beheld a most</p>
<p>wonderful sight.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<p>&quot;Love is like a dizziness,&quot; says the old song.  Love is something</p>
<p>else - it is the most selfish feeling in existence.  Of course, I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t allude to the fraternal or the friendly, or any other such</p>
<p>nonsensical old-fashioned trash that artless people still believe</p>
<p>in, but to the real genuine article that Adam felt for Eve when</p>
<p>he first saw her, and which all who read this - above the</p>
<p>innocent and unsusceptible age of twelve - have experienced.  And</p>
<p>the fancy and the reality are so much alike, that they amount to</p>
<p>about the same thing.  The former perhaps, may be a little</p>
<p>short-lived; but it is just as disagreeable a sensation while it</p>
<p>lasts se its more enduring sister.  Love is said to be blind, and</p>
<p>it also has a very injurious effect on the eyesight of its</p>
<p>victims - an effect that neither spectacles nor oculists can aid</p>
<p>in the slightest degree, making them see whether sleeping or</p>
<p>waking, but one object, and that alone.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know whether these were Mr. Malcolm or Ormiston&#x27;s</p>
<p>thoughts, as he leaned against the door-way, and folded his arms</p>
<p>across his chest to await the shining of his day-star.  In fact,</p>
<p>I am pretty sure they were not:  young gentlemen, as a general</p>
<p>thing, not being any more given to profound moralizing in the</p>
<p>reign of His Most Gracious Majesty, Charles II., than they are at</p>
<p>the present day; but I do know, that no sooner was his bosom</p>
<p>friend and crony, Sir Norman Kingsley, out of eight, than he</p>
<p>forgot him as teetotally an if he had never known that</p>
<p>distinguished individual.  His many and deep afflictions, his</p>
<p>love, his anguish, and his provocations; his beautiful,</p>
<p>tantalizing, and mysterious lady-love; his errand and its</p>
<p>probable consequences, all were forgotten; and Ormiston  thought</p>
<p>of nothing or nobody in the world but himself and La Masque.  La</p>
<p>Masque!  La Masque! that was the theme on which his thoughts</p>
<p>rang, with wild variations of alternate hope and fear, like every</p>
<p>other lover since the world began, and love was first an</p>
<p>institution.  &quot;As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall</p>
<p>be,&quot; truly, truly it is an odd and wonderful thing.  And you and</p>
<p>I may thank our stars, dear readers, that we are a great deal too</p>
<p>sensible to wear our hearts in our sleeves for such s</p>
<p>bloodthirsty dew to peck at.  Ormiston&#x27;s flame was longer-lived</p>
<p>than Sir Norman&#x27;s; he had been in love a whole month, and had it</p>
<p>badly, and was now at the very crisis of a malady.  Why did she</p>
<p>conceal her face - would she ever disclose it - would she listen</p>
<p>to him - would she ever love him? feverishly asked Passion; and</p>
<p>Common Sense (or what little of that useful commodity he had</p>
<p>left) answered - probably because she was eccentric - possibly</p>
<p>she would disclose it for the same reason; that he had only to</p>
<p>try and make her listen; and as to her loving him, why, Common</p>
<p>Sense owned he had her there.</p>
<p>I can&#x27;t say whether the adage! &quot;Faint heart never won fair lady!&quot;</p>
<p>was extant in his time; but the spirit of it certainly was, and</p>
<p>Ormiston determined to prove it.  He wanted to see La Masque, and</p>
<p>try his fate once again; and see her he would, if he had to stay</p>
<p>there as a sort of ornamental prop to the house for a week.  He</p>
<p>knew he might as well look for a needle in a haystack as his</p>
<p>whimsical beloved through the streets of London - dismal and dark</p>
<p>now as the streets of Luxor and Tadmor in Egypt; and he wisely</p>
<p>resolved to spare himself and his Spanish leathers boots the</p>
<p>trial of a one-handed game of &quot;hide-and-go-to-seek.&quot;  Wisdom,</p>
<p>like Virtue, is its own reward; and scarcely had he come to this</p>
<p>laudable conclusion, when, by the feeble glimmer of the</p>
<p>house-lamps, he saw a figure that made his heart bound, flitting</p>
<p>through the night-gloom toward him.  He would have known that</p>
<p>figure on the sands of Sahara, in an Indian jungle, or an</p>
<p>American forest - a tall, slight, supple figure, bending and</p>
<p>springing like a bow of steel, queenly and regal as that of a</p>
<p>young empress.  It was draped in a long cloak reaching to the</p>
<p>ground, in color as black as the night, and clasped by a jewel</p>
<p>whose glittering flash, he saw even there; a velvet hood of the</p>
<p>same color covered the stately head; and the mask - the tiresome,</p>
<p>inevitable mask covered the beautiful - he was positive it was</p>
<p>beautiful - face.  He had seen her a score of times in that very</p>
<p>dress, flitting like a dark, graceful ghost through the city</p>
<p>streets, and the sight sent his heart plunging against his side</p>
<p>like an inward sledge-hammer.  Would one pulse in her heart stir</p>
<p>ever so faintly at sight of him?  Just as he asked himself the</p>
<p>question, and was stepping forward to moot her, feeling very like</p>
<p>the country swain in love - &quot;hot and dry like, with a pain in his</p>
<p>side like&quot; - he suddenly stopped.  Another figure came forth from</p>
<p>the shadow of an opposite house, and softly pronounced her name.</p>
<p>It was a short figure - a woman&#x27;s figure.  He could not see the</p>
<p>face, and that was an immense relief to him, and prevented his</p>
<p>having jealousy added to his other pains sad tribulations.  La</p>
<p>Masque paused as well as he, and her soft voice softly asked:</p>
<p>&quot;Who calls?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is I, madame - Prudence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!  I am glad to meet you.  I have been searching the city</p>
<p>through for you.  Where have you been?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I was so frightened that I don&#x27;t know where I fled to,</p>
<p>and I could scarcely make up my mind to come back at all.  I did</p>
<p>feel dreadfully sorry for her, poor thing! but you know, Madame</p>
<p>Masque, I could do nothing for her, and I should not have come</p>
<p>back, only I was afraid of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You did wrong, Prudence,&quot; said La Masque, sternly, or at least</p>
<p>as sternly as so sweet a voice could speak; &quot;you did very wrong</p>
<p>to leave her in such a way.  You should have come to me at once,</p>
<p>and told me all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, madame, I was so frightened!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bah!  You are nothing but a coward.  Come into this doorway, and</p>
<p>tell me all about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston drew back as the twain approached, and entered the deep</p>
<p>portals of La Masque&#x27;s own doorway.  He could see them both by</p>
<p>the aforesaid faint lamplight, and he noticed that La Masque&#x27;s</p>
<p>companion was a wrinkled old woman, that would not trouble the</p>
<p>peace of mind of the most jealous lover in Christendom.  Perhaps</p>
<p>it was not just the thing to hover aloof and listen; but he could</p>
<p>not for the life of him help it; and stand and listen he</p>
<p>accordingly did.  Who knew but this nocturnal conversation might</p>
<p>throw some light on the dark mystery he was anxious to see</p>
<p>through, and, could his ears have run into needle-points to hear</p>
<p>the better, he would have had the operation then and there</p>
<p>performed.  There was a moment&#x27;s silence after the two entered</p>
<p>the portal, during which La Masque stood, tall, dark, and</p>
<p>commanding, motionless as a marble column; and the little</p>
<p>withered old specimen of humanity beside her stood gazing up at</p>
<p>her with something between fear and fascination.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know what has become of your charge, Prudence?&quot; asked the</p>
<p>low, vibrating voice of La Masque, at last.</p>
<p>&quot;How could I, madame?  You know I fled from the house, and I</p>
<p>dared not go back.  Perhaps she is there still.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps she is not?  Do you suppose that sharp shriek of yours</p>
<p>was unheard?  No; she was found; and what do you suppose has</p>
<p>become of her?&quot;</p>
<p>The old woman looked up, and seemed to read in the dark, stern</p>
<p>figure, and the deep solemn voice, the fatal truth.  She wrong</p>
<p>her hands with a sort of cry.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!  I know, I know; they have put her in the dead-cart, and</p>
<p>buried her in the plague-pit.  O my dear, sweet young mistress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you had stayed by your dear, sweet young mistress, instead of</p>
<p>running screaming away as you did, it might not have happened,&quot;</p>
<p>said La Masque, in a tone between derision and contempt.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame,&quot; sobbed the old woman, who was crying, &quot;she was dying of</p>
<p>the plague, and how could I help it?  They would have buried her</p>
<p>in spite of me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She was not dead; there was your mistake.  She was as much alive</p>
<p>as you or I at this moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I left her dead!&quot; said the old woman positively.</p>
<p>&quot;Prudence, you did no such thing; you left her fainting, and in</p>
<p>that state she was found and carried to the plague-pit.&quot;</p>
<p>The old woman stood silent for a moment, with a face of intense</p>
<p>horror, and then she clasped both hands with a wild cry.</p>
<p>&quot;O my God!  And they buried her alive - buried her alive in that</p>
<p>dreadful plague-pit!&quot;</p>
<p>La Masque, leaning against a pillar, stood unmoved; and her</p>
<p>voice, when she spoke, was as coldly sweet as modern ice-cream.</p>
<p>&quot;Not exactly.  She was not buried at all, as I happen to know.</p>
<p>But when did you discover that she had the plague, and how could</p>
<p>she possibly have caught it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I do not know, madam.  She seemed well enough all day,</p>
<p>though not in such high spirits as a bride should be.  Toward</p>
<p>evening die complained of a headache and a feeling of faintness;</p>
<p>but I thought nothing of it, and helped her to dress for the</p>
<p>bridal.  Before it was over, the headache and faintness grew</p>
<p>worse, and I gave her wine, and still suspected nothing.  The</p>
<p>last time I came in, she had grown so much worse, that</p>
<p>notwithstanding her wedding dress, she had lain down on her bed,</p>
<p>looking for all the world like a ghost, and told me she had the</p>
<p>most dreadful burning pain in her chest.  Then, madame, the</p>
<p>horrid truth struck me - I tore down her dress, and there, sure</p>
<p>enough, was the awful mark of the distemper.  `You have the</p>
<p>plague!&#x27; I shrieked; and then I fled down stairs and out of the</p>
<p>house, like one crazy.  O madame, madame!  I shall never forget</p>
<p>it - it was terrible!  I shall never forget it! Poor, poor child;</p>
<p>and the count does not know a word of it!&quot;</p>
<p>La Masque laughed - a sweet, clear, deriding laugh, &quot;So the count</p>
<p>does not know it, Prudence?  Poor man! he will be in despair when</p>
<p>he finds it out, won&#x27;t he?  Such an ardent and devoted lover as</p>
<p>he was you know!&quot;</p>
<p>Prudence looked up a little puzzled.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, madame, I think so.  He seemed very fond of her; a great</p>
<p>deal fonder than she ever was of him.  The fact is, madame,&quot; said</p>
<p>Prudence, lowering her voice to a confidential stage whisper,</p>
<p>&quot;she never seemed fond of him at all, and wouldn&#x27;t have been</p>
<p>married, I think, if she could have helped it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could have helped it?  What do you mean, Prudence?  Nobody made</p>
<p>her, did they?&quot;</p>
<p>Prudence fidgeted, and looked rather uneasy.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, madame, she was not exactly forced, perhaps; but you know -</p>
<p>you know you told me - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said La Masque, coldly.</p>
<p>&quot;To do what I could,&quot; cried Prudence, in a sort of desperation;</p>
<p>&quot;and I did it, madame, and harassed her about it night and day.</p>
<p>And then the count was there, too, coaxing and entreating; and he</p>
<p>was handsome and had such ways with him that no woman could</p>
<p>resist, much less one so little used to gentlemen as Leoline.</p>
<p>And so, Madame Masque, we kept at her till we got her to consent</p>
<p>to it at last; but in her secret heart, I know she did not want</p>
<p>to be married - at least to the count,&quot; said Prudence, on serious</p>
<p>afterthought.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well; that has nothing to do with it.  The question is,</p>
<p>where it she to be found?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Found!&quot; echoed Prudence; &quot;has she then been lost?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of coarse she has, you old simpleton!  How could she help it,</p>
<p>and she dead, with no one to look after her?&quot; said La Masque,</p>
<p>with something like a half laugh.  &quot;She was carried to the</p>
<p>plague-pit in her bridal-robes, jewels and lace; and, when about</p>
<p>to be thrown in, was discovered, like Moses is the bulrushes, to</p>
<p>be all alive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; whispered Prudence, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, O most courageous of guardians! she was carried to a</p>
<p>certain house, and left to her own devices, while her gallant</p>
<p>rescuer went for a doctor; and when they returned she was</p>
<p>missing.  Our pretty Leoline seems to have a strong fancy for</p>
<p>getting lost!&quot;</p>
<p>There was a pause, during which Prudence looked at her with a</p>
<p>face fall of mingled fear and curiosity.  At last:</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, how do you know all this?  Were you there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.  Not I, indeed!  What would take me there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then how do you happen to know everything about it?&quot;</p>
<p>La Masque laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;A little bird told me, Prudence!  Have you returned to resume</p>
<p>your old duties?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I dare not go into that house again.  I am afraid of</p>
<p>taking the plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prudence, you are a perfect idiot!  Are you not liable to take</p>
<p>the plague in the remotest quarter of this plague-infested city?</p>
<p>And even if you do take it, what odds?  You have only a few years</p>
<p>to live, at the most, and what matter whether you die now or at</p>
<p>the end of a year or two?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What matter?&quot; repeated Prudence, in a high key of indignant</p>
<p>amazement.  &quot;It may make no matter to you, Madame Masque, but it</p>
<p>makes a great deal to me; I can tell you; and into that infected</p>
<p>house I&#x27;ll not put one foot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just as you please, only in that case there is no need for</p>
<p>further talk, so allow me to bid you good-night!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, madame, what of Leoline?  Do stop one moment and tell me of</p>
<p>her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What have I to tell?  I have told you all I know.  If you want</p>
<p>to find her, you must search in the city or in the pest-house!&quot;</p>
<p>Prudence shuddered, and covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;O, my poor darling! so good and so beautiful.  Heaven might</p>
<p>surely have spared her!  Are you going to do nothing farther</p>
<p>about it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What can I do?  I have searched for her and have not found her,</p>
<p>and what else remains?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, you know everything - surely, surely you know where my</p>
<p>poor little nursling is, among the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>Again La Masque laughed - another of her low, sweet, derisive</p>
<p>laughs.</p>
<p>&quot;No such thing, Prudence.  If I did, I should have her here in a</p>
<p>twinkling, depend upon - it.  However, it all comes to the same</p>
<p>thing in the end.  She is probably dead by this time, and would</p>
<p>have to be buried in the plague-pit, anyhow.  If you have nothing</p>
<p>further to say, Prudence, you had better bid me good-night, and</p>
<p>let me go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good-night, madame!&quot; said Prudence, with a sort of groan, as she</p>
<p>wrapped her cloak closely around her, and turned to go.</p>
<p>La Masque stood for a moment looking after her, and then placed a</p>
<p>key in the lock of the door.  But there is many a slip - she was</p>
<p>not fated to enter as soon as she thought; for just at that</p>
<p>moment a new step sounded beside her, a new voice pronounced her</p>
<p>name, and looking around, she beheld Ormiston.  With what</p>
<p>feelings that young person had listened to the neat and</p>
<p>appropriate dialogue I have just had the pleasure of</p>
<p>immortalizing, may be - to use a phrase you may have heard</p>
<p>before, once or twice - better imagined than described.  He knew</p>
<p>very well who Leoline was, and how she had been saved from the</p>
<p>plague-pit; but where in the world had La Masque found it out.</p>
<p>Lost in a maze of wonder, and inclined to doubt the evidence of</p>
<p>his own ears, he had stood perfectly still, until his ladylove</p>
<p>had so coolly dismissed her company, and then rousing himself</p>
<p>just in time, he had come forward and accosted her.  La Masque</p>
<p>turned round, regarded him in silence for a moment, and when she</p>
<p>spoke, her voice had an accent of mingled surprise and</p>
<p>displeasure.</p>
<p>&quot;You, Mr. Ormiston!  How many more times am I to have the</p>
<p>pleasure of seeing you again to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon, madame; it is the last time.  But you must hear me now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Must I?  Very well, then; if I must, you had better begin at</p>
<p>once, for the night-air is said to be unhealthy, and as good</p>
<p>people are scarce, I want to take care of myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In that case, perhaps you had better let me enter, too.  I hate</p>
<p>to talk on the street, for every wall has ears.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am aware of that.  When I was talking to my old friend,</p>
<p>Prudence, two minutes ago, I saw a tall shape that I have reason</p>
<p>to know, since it haunts me, like my own shadow, standing there</p>
<p>and paying deed attention.  I hope you found our conversation</p>
<p>improving, Mr. Ormiston!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame!&quot; began Ormiston, turning crimson.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, don&#x27;t blush; there is quite light enough from yonder lamp to</p>
<p>show that.  Besides,&quot; added the lady, easily, &quot;I don&#x27;t know as I</p>
<p>had any objection; you are interested in Leoline, and must feel</p>
<p>curious to know something about her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, what must you think of me?  I have acted unpardonably.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I know all that.  There is no need to apologize, and I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>think any the worse of you for it.  Will you come to business,</p>
<p>Mr. Ormiston?  I think I told you I wanted to go in.  What may</p>
<p>you want of me at this dismal hour?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O madame, need you ask!  Does not your own heart tell you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not aware that it does!  And to tell you the truth, Mr.</p>
<p>Ormiston, I don&#x27;t know that I even have a heart!  I am afraid I</p>
<p>mast trouble you to put it in words.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, madame, I love you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is that all?  If my memory serves me, you have told me that</p>
<p>little fact several times before.  Is there anything else</p>
<p>tormenting you, or may I go in?&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston groaned out an oath between his teeth, and La Masque</p>
<p>raised one jeweled, snowy taper finger, reprovingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t Mr. Ormiston - it&#x27;s naughty, you know!  May I go in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, you are enough to drive a man mad.  Is the love I bear</p>
<p>you worthy of nothing but mockery!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Mr. Ormiston, it is not; that is, supposing you really love</p>
<p>me, which you don&#x27;t.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you needn&#x27;t flash and look indignant; it is quite true!</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t be absurd, Mr. Ormiston.  How is it possible for you to</p>
<p>love one you have never seen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen you.  Do you think I am blind?&quot; he demanded,</p>
<p>indignantly.</p>
<p>&quot;My face, I mean.  I don&#x27;t consider that you can see a person</p>
<p>without looking in her face.  Now you have never looked in mine,</p>
<p>and how do you know I have any face at all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, you mock me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all.  How are you to know what is behind this mask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I feel it, and that is better; and I love you all the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Ormiston, how do you know but I am ugly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I do not believe you are; you are all too perfect not to</p>
<p>have a perfect face; and even were it otherwise, I still love</p>
<p>you!&quot;</p>
<p>She broke into a laugh  -one of her low, short, deriding laughs.</p>
<p>&quot;You do!  O man, how wise thou art!  I tell you, if I took off</p>
<p>this mask, the sight would curdle the very blood in your veins</p>
<p>with horror - would freeze the lifeblood in your heart.  I tell</p>
<p>you!&quot; she passionately cried, &quot;there are sights too horrible for</p>
<p>human beings to look on and live, and this  -this is one of</p>
<p>them!&quot;</p>
<p>He started back, and stared at her aghast.</p>
<p>&quot;You think me mad,&quot; she said, in a less fierce tone, &quot;but I am</p>
<p>not; and I repeat it, Mr. Ormiston, the sight of what this mask</p>
<p>conceals would blast you.  Go now, for Heaven&#x27;s sake, and leave</p>
<p>me in peace, to drag out the rest of my miserable life; and if</p>
<p>ever you think of me, let it be to pray that it might speedily</p>
<p>end.  You have forced me to say this: so now be content.  Be</p>
<p>merciful, and go!&quot;</p>
<p>She made a desperate gesture, and turned to leave him, but he</p>
<p>caught her hand and held her fast.</p>
<p>&quot;Never!&quot; he cried, fiercely.  &quot;Say what you will! let that mask</p>
<p>hide what it may!  I will never leave you till life leaves me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Man, you are mad!  Release my hand and let me go!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, hear me.  There is but one way to prove my love, and my</p>
<p>sanity, and that is - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well?&quot; she said, almost touched by his earnestness.</p>
<p>&quot;Raise your mask and try me!  Show me your face and see if I do</p>
<p>not love you still!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truly I know how much love you will have for me when it is</p>
<p>revealed.  Do you know that no one has looked in my face for the</p>
<p>last eight years.&quot;</p>
<p>He stood and gazed at her in wonder.</p>
<p>&quot;It is so, Mr. Ormiston; and in my heart I have vowed a vow to</p>
<p>plunge headlong into the most loathsome plague-pit in London,</p>
<p>rather than ever raise it again.  My friend, be satisfied.  Go</p>
<p>and leave me; go and forget me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can do neither until I have ceased to forget every thing</p>
<p>earthly.  Madame, I implore you, hear me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Ormiston, I tell you, you but court your own doom.  No one</p>
<p>can look on me and live!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will risk it,&quot; he said with an incredulous smile.  &quot;Only</p>
<p>promise to show me your face.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be it so then!&quot; she cried almost fiercely.  &quot;I promise, and be</p>
<p>the consequences on your own head.&quot;</p>
<p>His whole face flushed with joy.</p>
<p>&quot;I accept them.  And when is that happy time to come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows!  What must be done, had best be done quickly; but I</p>
<p>tell thee it were safer to play with the lightning&#x27;s chain than</p>
<p>tamper with what thou art about to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I take the risk!  Will you raise your mask now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no - I cannot!  But yet, I may before the sun rises.  My</p>
<p>face&quot; - with bitter scorn - &quot;shows better by darkness than by</p>
<p>daylight.  Will you be out to see, the grand illumination.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Most certainly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then meet me here an hour after midnight, and the face so long</p>
<p>hidden shall be revealed.  But, once again, on the threshold of</p>
<p>doom, I entreat you to pause.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no such word for me!&quot; he fiercely and exultingly cried.</p>
<p>&quot;I have your promise, and I shall hold you to it!  And, madame,</p>
<p>if, at last, you discover my love is changeless as fate itself,</p>
<p>then - then may I not dare to hope for a return?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; then you may hope,&quot; she said, with cold mockery.  &quot;If your</p>
<p>love survives the sight, it will be mighty, indeed, and well</p>
<p>worthy a return,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you will return it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will be my wife?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With all my heart!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My darling!&quot; he cried, rapturously - &quot;for you are mine already -</p>
<p>how can I ever thank you for this?  If s whole lifetime devoted</p>
<p>and consecrated to your happiness can repay you, it shall be</p>
<p>yours!&quot;</p>
<p>During this rhapsody, her hand had been on the handle of the</p>
<p>door.  Now she turned it.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-night, Mr. Ormiston,&quot; she said, and vanished.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<p>THE EARL&#x27;S BARGE.</p>
<p>Shocks of joy, they tell me, seldom kill.  Of my own knowledge I</p>
<p>cannot say, for I have had precious little experience of such</p>
<p>shocks in my lifetime, Heaven knows; but in the present instance,</p>
<p>I can safely aver, they had no such dismal effect on Ormiston.</p>
<p>Nothing earthly could have given that young gentleman a greater</p>
<p>shock of joy than the knowledge he was to behold the long hidden</p>
<p>face of his idol.  That that face was ugly, he did not for an</p>
<p>instant believe, or, at least, it never world be ugly to him.</p>
<p>With a form so perfect - a form a sylph might have envied - a</p>
<p>voice sweeter than the Singing Fountain of Arabia, hands and feet</p>
<p>the most perfectly beautiful the sun ever shone on, it was simply</p>
<p>a moral and physical impossibility, then, they could be joined to</p>
<p>a repulsive face.  There was a remote possibility that it was a</p>
<p>little less exquisite than those ravishing items, and that her</p>
<p>morbid fancy made her imagine it homely, compared with them, but</p>
<p>he knew he never would share in that opinion.  It was the</p>
<p>reasoning of lover, rather, the logic; for when love glides</p>
<p>smiling in at the door, reason stalks gravely, not to say</p>
<p>sulkily, out of the window, and, standing afar off, eyes</p>
<p>disdainfully the didos and antics of her late tenement.  There</p>
<p>was very little reason, therefore, in Ormiston&#x27;s head and heart,</p>
<p>but a great deal of something sweeter, joy - joy that thrilled</p>
<p>and vibrated through every nerve within him.  Leaning against the</p>
<p>portal, in an absurd delirium of delight - for it takes but a</p>
<p>trifle to jerk those lovers from the slimiest depths of the</p>
<p>Slough of Despond to the topmost peak of the mountain of ecstasy</p>
<ul>
<li>he uncovered his head that the night-air might cool its</li>
</ul>
<p>feverish throbbings.  But the night-air was as hot as his heart;</p>
<p>and, almost suffocated by the sultry closeness, he was about to</p>
<p>start for a plunge in the river, when the sound of coming</p>
<p>footsteps and voices arrested him.  He had met with so many odd</p>
<p>ad ventures to-night that he stopped now to see who was coming;</p>
<p>for on every hand all was silent and forsaken,</p>
<p>Footsteps and voices came closer; two figures took shape in the</p>
<p>gloom, and emerged from the darkness into the glimmering lamp</p>
<p>light.  He recognised them both.  One was the Earl of Rochester;</p>
<p>the other, his dark-eyed, handsome page - that strange page with</p>
<p>the face of the lost lady!  The earl was chatting familiarly, and</p>
<p>laughing obstreperously at something or other, while the boy</p>
<p>merely wore a languid smile, as if anything further in that line</p>
<p>were quite beneath his dignity.</p>
<p>&quot;Silence and solitude,&quot; said the earl, with a careless glance</p>
<p>around, &quot; I protest, Hubert, this night seems endless.  How long</p>
<p>is it till midnight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An hour and a half at least, I should fancy,&quot; answered the boy,</p>
<p>with a strong foreign accent.  &quot;I know it struck ten as we passed</p>
<p>St. Paul&#x27;s.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This grand bonfire of our most worshipful Lord Mayor will be a</p>
<p>sight worth seeing,&quot; remarked the earl.  &quot;When all these piles</p>
<p>are lighted, the city will be one sea of fire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A slight foretaste of what most of its inhabitants will behold</p>
<p>in another world,&quot; said the page, with a French shrug.  &quot;I have</p>
<p>heard Lilly&#x27;s prediction that London is to be purified by fire,</p>
<p>like a second Sodom; perhaps it is to be verified to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not unlikely; the dome of St. Paul&#x27;s would be an excellent place</p>
<p>to view the conflagration.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The river will do almost as well, my lord.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We will have a chance of knowing that presently,&quot; said the earl,</p>
<p>as he and his page descended to the river, where the little</p>
<p>gilded barge lay moored, and the boatman waiting.</p>
<p>As they passed from sight Ormiston came forth, and watched</p>
<p>thoughtfully after them.  The face and figure were that of the</p>
<p>lady, but the voice was different; both were clear and musical</p>
<p>enough, but she spoke English with the purest accent, while his</p>
<p>was the voice of a foreigner.  It most have been one of those</p>
<p>strange, unaccountable likenesses we sometimes see among perfect</p>
<p>strangers, but the resemblance in this ease was something</p>
<p>wonderful.  It brought his thoughts back from himself sad his own</p>
<p>fortunate love, to his violently-smitten friend, Sir Norman, and</p>
<p>his plague-stricken beloved; and he began speculating what he</p>
<p>could possibly be about just then, or what he had discovered in</p>
<p>the old ruin.  Suddenly he was aroused; a moment before, the</p>
<p>silence had been almost oppressive but now on the wings of the</p>
<p>night, there came a shout.  A tumult of voices and footsteps were</p>
<p>approaching.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop her! Stop her!&quot; was cried by many voices; and the next</p>
<p>instant a fleet figure went flying past him with a rush, and</p>
<p>plunged head foremost into she river.</p>
<p>A slight female figure, with floating robes of white, waving hair</p>
<p>of deepest, blackness, with a sparkle of jewels on neck and arms.</p>
<p>Only for an instant did he see it; but he knew it well, and his</p>
<p>very heart stood still.  &quot;Stop her! stop her! she is ill of the</p>
<p>plague!&quot; shouted the crowd, preying panting on; but they came too</p>
<p>late; the white vision had gone down into the black, sluggish</p>
<p>river, and disappeared.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it?  What is it?  Where is it?&quot; cried two or three</p>
<p>watchmen, brandishing their halberds, and rushing up; and the</p>
<p>crowd-a small mob of a dozen or so-answered all at once: &quot;She is</p>
<p>delirious with the plague; she was running through the streets;</p>
<p>we gave chase, but she out-stepped us, and is now at the bottom</p>
<p>of the Thames.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston, waited to hear no more, but rushed precipitately down</p>
<p>to the waters edge.  The alarm has now reached the boats on the</p>
<p>river, and many eyes within them were turned in the direction</p>
<p>whence she had gone down.  Soon she reappeared on the dark</p>
<p>surface - something whiter than snow, whiter than death; shining</p>
<p>like silver, shone the glittering dress and marble face of the</p>
<p>bride.  A small batteau lay close to where Ormiston stood; in two</p>
<p>seconds he had sprang in, shoved it off, and was rowing</p>
<p>vigorously toward that snow wreath in the inky river.  But he was</p>
<p>forestalled, two hands white and jeweled as her own, reached over</p>
<p>the edge of a gilded barge, and, with the help of the boatmen,</p>
<p>lifted her in.  Before she could be properly established on the</p>
<p>cushioned seats, the batteau was alongside, and Ormiston turned a</p>
<p>very white and excited face toward the Earl of Rochester.</p>
<p>&quot;I know that lady, my lord!  She is a friend of mine, and you</p>
<p>must give her to me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it you, Ormiston?  Why what brings you here alone on the</p>
<p>river, at this hour?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have come for her,&quot; said Ormiston, pressing over to lift the</p>
<p>lady.  &quot;May I beg you to assist me, my lord, in transferring her</p>
<p>to my boat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must wait till I see her first,&quot; said Rochester, partly</p>
<p>raising her head, and holding a lamp close to her face, &quot;as I</p>
<p>have picked her out, I think I deserve it.  Heavens! what an</p>
<p>extraordinary likeness!&quot;</p>
<p>The earl had glanced at the lady, then at his page, again at the</p>
<p>lady, and lastly at Ormiston, his handsome countenance fall of</p>
<p>the most unmitigated wonder.  &quot;To whom?&quot; asked Ormiston, who had</p>
<p>very little need to inquire.</p>
<p>&quot;To Hubert, yonder.  Why, don&#x27;t you see it yourself?  She might</p>
<p>be his twin-sister!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She might be, but as she is not, you will have the goodness to</p>
<p>let me take charge of her.  She has escaped from her friends, and</p>
<p>I meet bring her back to them.&quot;</p>
<p>He half lifted her as he spoke; and the boatman, glad enough to</p>
<p>get rid of one sick of the plague, helped her into the batteau.</p>
<p>The lady was not insensible, as might be supposed, after her cold</p>
<p>bath, but extremely wide-awake, and gazing around her with her</p>
<p>great,</p>
<p>black, shining eyes.  But she made no resistance; either she was</p>
<p>too faint or frightened for that, and suffered herself to be</p>
<p>hoisted about, &quot;passive to all changes.&quot;  Ormiston spread his</p>
<p>cloak in the stern of the boat, and laid her tenderly upon it,</p>
<p>and though the beautiful, wistful eyes were solemnly and</p>
<p>unwinkingly fixed on his face, the pale, sweet lips parted not -</p>
<p>uttered never a word.  The wet bridal robes were drenched and</p>
<p>dripping about her, the long dark hair hung in saturated masses</p>
<p>over her neck and arms, and contrasted vividly with a face,</p>
<p>Ormiston thought at once, the whitest, most beautiful, and most</p>
<p>stonelike he had ever seen.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, my man; thank you, my lord,&quot; said Ormiston, preparing</p>
<p>to push off.</p>
<p>Rochester, who had been leaning from the barge, gazing in mingled</p>
<p>curiosity, wonder, and admiration at the lovely face, turned now</p>
<p>to her champion.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is she, Ormiston?&quot; he said, persuasively.</p>
<p>But Ormiston only laughed, and rowed energetically for the shore.</p>
<p>The crowd was still lingering; and half a dozen hands were</p>
<p>extended to draw the boat up to the landing.  He lifted the light</p>
<p>form in his arms and bore it from the boat; but before he could</p>
<p>proceed farther with his armful of beauty, a faint but imperious</p>
<p>voice spoke: &quot;Please put me down.  I am not a baby, and can walk</p>
<p>myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston was so surprised, or rather dismayed, by this unexpected</p>
<p>address, that he complied at once, and placed her on her own</p>
<p>pretty feet.  But the young lady&#x27;s sense of propriety was a good</p>
<p>deal stronger than her physical powers; and she swayed and</p>
<p>tottered, and had to cling to her unknown friend for support.</p>
<p>&quot;You are scarcely strong enough, I am afraid, dear lady,&quot; he</p>
<p>said, kindly.  &quot;You had better let me carry you.  I assure you I</p>
<p>am quite equal to it, or even a more weighty burden, if necessity</p>
<p>required.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; said the faint voice, faintly; &quot;but I would</p>
<p>rather walk.  Where are you taking me to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To your own house, if you wish - it is quite close at hand,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.  Yes.  Let us go there!  Prudence in there, and she will</p>
<p>take care of me.&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Will she?&quot; said Ormiston, doubtfully. &quot;I hope you do not suffer</p>
<p>much pain!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not suffer at all, she said, wearily; &quot;only I am so tired.</p>
<p>Oh, I wish I were home!&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston half led, half lifted her up the stairs.</p>
<p>&quot;You are almost there, dear lady - see, it is close st hand!&quot;</p>
<p>She half lifted her languid eyes, but did not speak.  Leaning</p>
<p>panting on his arm, he drew her gently on until they reached her</p>
<p>door.  It was still unfastened.  Prudence had kept her word, and</p>
<p>not gone near it; and he opened it, and helped her in.</p>
<p>&quot;Where now?&quot; h? asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Up stairs,&quot; she said, feebly.  &quot;I want to go to my own room.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston knew where that was, and assisted her there as tenderly</p>
<p>as he could have done La Masque herself.  He paused on the</p>
<p>threshold; for the room was dark.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a lamp and a tinder-box on the mantel,&quot; said the faint,</p>
<p>sweet voice, &quot;if you will only please to find them.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston crowed the room - fortunately he knew the latitude of</p>
<p>the place  -and moving his hand with gingerly precaution along</p>
<p>the mantel-shelf, lest he should upset any of the gimcracks</p>
<p>thereon, soon obtained the articles named, and struck a light.</p>
<p>The lady was leaning wearily against the door-post, but now she</p>
<p>came forward, and dropped exhausted into the downy pillows of a</p>
<p>lounge.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there anything I can do for you, madame?&quot; began Ormiston,</p>
<p>with as solicitous an air as though he had been her father.  &quot;A</p>
<p>glass of wine would be of use to you, I think, and then, if you</p>
<p>wish, I will go for a doctor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are very kind.  You will find wine and glasses in the room</p>
<p>opposite this, and I feel so faint that I think you had better</p>
<p>bring me some.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston moved across the passage, like the good, obedient young</p>
<p>man that he was, filled a glass of Burgundy, and as he was</p>
<p>returning with it, was startled by s cry from the lady that</p>
<p>nearly made him drop and shiver it on the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;What under heaven has come to her now?&quot; he thought, hastening</p>
<p>in, wondering how she could possibly have come to grief since he</p>
<p>left her.</p>
<p>She was sitting upright on the sofa, her dress palled down off</p>
<p>her shoulder where the plague-spot had been , and which, to his</p>
<p>amazement, he saw now pure and stainless, and free from every</p>
<p>loathsome trace.</p>
<p>&quot;You are cured of the plague!&quot; was all he could say.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank God!&quot; she exclaimed, fervently clasping her hands.  &quot;But</p>
<p>oh!  how can it have happened?  It mast be a miracle!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it was your plunge into the river; I have heard of one or</p>
<p>two such cases before, and if ever I take it,&quot; said Ormiston,</p>
<p>half laughing, half shuddering, &quot;my first rush shall be for old</p>
<p>Father Thames.  Here, drink this, I am certain it will complete</p>
<p>the cure.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl - she was nothing but a girl - drank it off and sat</p>
<p>upright like one inspired with new life.  As she set down the</p>
<p>glass, she lifted her dark, solemn, beautiful eyes to his face</p>
<p>with a long, searching gaze.</p>
<p>&quot;What is your name?&quot; she simply asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Ormiston, madame,&quot; he said, bowing low.</p>
<p>&quot;You have saved my life, have you not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was the Earl of Rochester who reserved you from the river;</p>
<p>but I would have done it a moment later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not mean that.  I mean&quot; - with a slight shudder - &quot;are you</p>
<p>not one of those I saw at the plague-pit?  Oh! that dreadful,</p>
<p>dreadful plague-pit!&quot; she cried, covering her face with her</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.  I am one of those.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who was the other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My friend, Sir Norman Kingsley.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley?&quot; she softly repeated, with a sort of</p>
<p>recognition in her voice and eyes, while a faint roseate glow</p>
<p>rose softly over her face and neck.  Ah! I thought - was it to</p>
<p>his house or yours I was brought?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To his,&quot; replied Ormiston, looking at her curiously; for he had</p>
<p>seen that rosy glow, and was extremely puzzled thereby; &quot;from</p>
<p>whence, allow me to add, you took your departure rather</p>
<p>unceremoniously.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did I?&quot; she said, in a bewildered sort of way.  &quot;It is all like</p>
<p>a dream to me.  I remember Prudence screaming, and telling me I</p>
<p>had the plague, and the unutterable horror that filled me when I</p>
<p>heard it; and then the next thing I recollect is, being at the</p>
<p>plague-pit, and seeing your face and his bending over me.  All</p>
<p>the horror came back with that awakening, and between it and</p>
<p>anguish of the plague-sore I think I fainted again.&quot;  (Ormiston</p>
<p>nodded sagaciously), &quot;and when I next recovered I was alone in a</p>
<p>strange room, and in bed.  I noticed that, though I think I must</p>
<p>have been delirious.  And then, half-mad with agony, I got out to</p>
<p>the street, somehow and ran, and ran, and ran, until the people</p>
<p>saw and followed me here.  I suppose I had some idea of reaching</p>
<p>home when I came here; but the crowd pressed so close behind, and</p>
<p>I felt though all my delirium, that they would bring me to the</p>
<p>pest-house if they caught me, and drowning seemed to me</p>
<p>preferable to that.  So I was in the river before I knew it - and</p>
<p>you know the rest as well as I do.  But I owe you my life, Mr.</p>
<p>Ormiston - owe it to you and another; and I thank you both with</p>
<p>all my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, you are too grateful; and I don&#x27;t know as we have done</p>
<p>anything much to deserve it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have saved my life; and though you may think that a</p>
<p>valueless trifle, not worth speaking of, I assure you I view it</p>
<p>in a very different light,&quot; she said, with a half smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Lady, your life is invaluable; but as to our saving it, why, you</p>
<p>would not have us throw you alive into the plague-pit, would</p>
<p>you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would have been rather barbarous, I confess, but there are</p>
<p>few who would risk infection for the sake of a mere stranger.</p>
<p>Instead of doing as you did, you might have sent me to the pest-</p>
<p>house, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, as to that, all your gratitude is due to Sir Norman.  He</p>
<p>managed the whole affair, and what is more, fell - but I will</p>
<p>leave that for himself to disclose.  Meantime, may I ask the name</p>
<p>of the lady I have been so fortunate as to serve!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Undoubtedly, sir - my name is Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline is only half a name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I am so unfortunate an only to possess half a name, for I</p>
<p>never had any other.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston opened his eyes very wide indeed.</p>
<p>&quot;No other! you must have had a father some time in your life;</p>
<p>most people have,&quot; said the young gentleman, reflectively.</p>
<p>She shook her head a little sadly.</p>
<p>&quot;I never had, that I know of, either father or mother, or any one</p>
<p>but Prudence.  And by the way,&quot; she said, half starting up, &quot;the</p>
<p>first thing to be done is, to see about this same Prudence.  She</p>
<p>must be somewhere in the house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prudence is nowhere in the house,&quot; said Ormiston, quietly; &quot;and</p>
<p>will not be, she says, far a month to come.  She is afraid of the</p>
<p>plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is she?&quot; said Leoline, fixing her eyes on him with a powerful</p>
<p>glance.  &quot;How do you know that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I heard her say so not half an hour ago, to a lady a few doors</p>
<p>distant.  Perhaps you know her - La Masque.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That singular being!  I don&#x27;t know her; but I have seen her</p>
<p>often.  Why was Prudence talking of me to her, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I do not know; but talking of you the was, and she said she</p>
<p>was coming back here no more.  Perhaps you will be afraid to stay</p>
<p>here alone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, I am used to being alone,&quot; she said, with a little sigh,</p>
<p>&quot;but where&quot; - hesitating and blushing vividly, &quot; where is - I</p>
<p>mean, I should like to thank sir Norman Kingsley.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston saw the blush and the eyes that dropped, and it puzzled</p>
<p>him again beyond measure.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know Sir Norman Kingsley?&quot; he suspiciously asked.</p>
<p>&quot;By sight I know many of the nobles of the court,&quot; she answered</p>
<p>evasively, and without looking up:  &quot;they pass here often, and</p>
<p>Prudence knows them all; and so I have learned to distinguish</p>
<p>them by name and sight, your friend among the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you would like to see my friend?&quot; he said, with malicious</p>
<p>emphasis.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to thank him,&quot; retorted the lady, with some</p>
<p>asperity: &quot;you have told me how much I owe him, and it strikes me</p>
<p>the desire is somewhat natural.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Without doubt it is, and it will save Sir Norman much fruitless</p>
<p>labor; for even now he is in search at you, and will neither rest</p>
<p>nor sleep until he finds you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In search of me!&quot; she said softly, and with that rosy glow again</p>
<p>illumining her beautiful face; &quot;he is indeed kind, and I am most</p>
<p>anxious to thank him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will bring him here in two hours, then,&quot; said Ormiston, with</p>
<p>energy; &quot;and though the hour may be a little unseasonable, I hope</p>
<p>you will not object to it; for if you do, he will certainly not</p>
<p>survive until morning.&quot;</p>
<p>She gayly laughed, but her cheek was scarlet.</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than that, Mr. Ormiston, I will even see him tonight.</p>
<p>You will find me here when you come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will not run away again, will you?&quot; said Ormiston, looking</p>
<p>at her doubtfully.  &quot;Excuse me; but you have a trick of doing</p>
<p>that, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>Again she laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you may safely trust me this time.  Are you going?&quot;</p>
<p>By way of reply, Ormiston took his hat and started for the door.</p>
<p>There he paused, with his hand upon it.</p>
<p>&quot;How long have you known Sir Norman Kingsley?&quot; was his careless,</p>
<p>artful question.</p>
<p>But Leoline, tapping one little foot on the floor, and looking</p>
<p>down at it with hot cheeks and humid ayes, answered not a word.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<p>THE MIDNIGHT QUEEN.</p>
<p>When Sir Norman Kingsley entered the ancient ruin, his head was</p>
<p>fall of Leoline - when he knelt down to look through the aperture</p>
<p>in the flagged floor, head and heart were full of her still.  But</p>
<p>the moment his eyes fell on the scene beneath, everything fled</p>
<p>far from his thoughts, Leoline among the rest; and nothing</p>
<p>remained but a profound and absorbing feeling of intensest amaze.</p>
<p>Right below him he beheld an immense room, of which the flag he</p>
<p>had raised seemed to form part of the ceiling, in a remote</p>
<p>corner.  Evidently it was one of a range of lower vaults, and as</p>
<p>he was at least fourteen feet above it, and his corner somewhat</p>
<p>in shadow, there was little danger of his being seen.  So,</p>
<p>leaning far down to look at his leisure, he took the goods the</p>
<p>gods provided him, and stared to his heart&#x27;s content.</p>
<p>Sir Norman had seen some queer sights daring the four-and-twenty</p>
<p>years he had spent in this queer world, but never anything quite</p>
<p>equal to this.  The apartment below, though so exceedingly large,</p>
<p>was lighted with the brilliance of noon-day; and every object it</p>
<p>contained; from one end to the other, was distinctly revealed.</p>
<p>The floor, from glimpses he had of it in obscure corners, was of</p>
<p>stone; but from end to end it was covered with richest rugs and</p>
<p>mats, and  squares of velvet of as many colors as Joseph&#x27;s coat.</p>
<p>The walls were hung with splendid tapestry, gorgeous in silk and</p>
<p>coloring, representing the wars of Troy, the exploits of Coeur de</p>
<p>Lion among the Saracens, the death of Hercules, all on one side;</p>
<p>and on the other, a more modern representation, the Field of the</p>
<p>Cloth of Gold.  The illumination proceeded from a range of wax</p>
<p>tapers in silver candelabra, that encircled the whole room.  The</p>
<p>air was redolent of perfumes, and filled with strains of softest</p>
<p>and sweetest music from unseen hands.  At one extremity of the</p>
<p>room was a huge door of glass and gilding; and opposite it, at</p>
<p>the other extremity, was a glittering throne.  It stood on a</p>
<p>raised dais, covered with crimson velvet, reached by two or three</p>
<p>steps carpeted with the same; the throne was as magnificent as</p>
<p>gold, and satin, and ornamentation could make it.  A great velvet</p>
<p>canopy of the same deep, rich color, cut in antique points, and</p>
<p>heavily hang with gold fringe, was above the seat of honor.</p>
<p>Beside it, to the right, but a little lower down, was a similar</p>
<p>throne, somewhat lees superb, and minus a canopy.  From the door</p>
<p>to the throne was a long strip of crimson velvet, edged and</p>
<p>embroidered with gold, and arranged in a sweeping semi-circle, on</p>
<p>either side, were a row of great carved, gilded, and cushioned</p>
<p>chairs, brilliant, too, with crimson and gold, and each for</p>
<p>every-day Christians, a throne in itself.  Between the blaze of</p>
<p>illumination, the flashing of gilding and gold, the tropical</p>
<p>flush of crimson velvet, the rainbow dyes on floor and walls, the</p>
<p>intoxicating gushes of perfume, and the delicious strains of</p>
<p>unseen music, it is no wonder Sir Norman Kingsley&#x27;s head was</p>
<p>spinning like a bewildered teetotum.</p>
<p>Was he sane - was he sleeping?  Had he drank too much wine at the</p>
<p>Golden Crown, and had it all gone to his head?  Was it a scene of</p>
<p>earnest enchantment, or were fairy-tales true?  Like Abou Hasson</p>
<p>when he awoke in the palace of the facetious Caliph of Bagdad, he</p>
<p>had no notion of believing his own eyes and ears, and quietly</p>
<p>concluded it was all an optical illusion, as ghosts are said to</p>
<p>be; but he quietly resolved to stay there, nevertheless, and see</p>
<p>how the dazzling phantasmagoria would end.  The music was</p>
<p>certainly ravishing, and it seemed to him, as he listened with</p>
<p>enchanted ears, that he never wanted to wake up from so heavenly</p>
<p>a dream.</p>
<p>One thing struck him as rather odd; strange and bewildered as</p>
<p>everything was, it did not seem at all strange to him, on the</p>
<p>contrary, a vague idea was floating mistily through his mind that</p>
<p>he had beheld precisely the same thing somewhere before.</p>
<p>Probably at some past period of his life he had beheld a similar</p>
<p>vision, or had seen a picture somewhere like it in a tale of</p>
<p>magic, and satisfying himself with this conclusion, he began</p>
<p>wondering if the genii of the place were going to make their</p>
<p>appearance at all, or if the knowledge that human eyes were upon</p>
<p>them had scared them back to Erebus.</p>
<p>While still ruminating on this important question, a portion of</p>
<p>the tapestry, almost beneath him, shriveled up and up, and out</p>
<p>flocked a glittering throng, with a musical mingling of laughter</p>
<p>and voices.  Still they came, more and more, until the great room</p>
<p>was almost filled, and a dazzling throng they were.  Sir Norman</p>
<p>had mingled in many a brilliant scene at Whitehall, where the</p>
<p>gorgeous court of Charles shown in all its splendor, with the</p>
<p>&quot;merry monarch&quot; at their head, but all he had ever witnessed at</p>
<p>the king&#x27;s court fell far short of this pageant.  Half the</p>
<p>brilliant flock were ladies, superb in satins, silks, velvets and</p>
<p>jewels.  And such jewels! every gem that ever flashed back the</p>
<p>sunlight sparkled and blazed in blending array on those beautiful</p>
<p>bosoms and arms - diamonds, pearls, opals, emeralds, rubies,</p>
<p>garnets, sapphires, amethysts - every jewel that ever shone.  But</p>
<p>neither dresses nor gems were half so superb as the peerless</p>
<p>forms they adorned; and such an army of perfectly beautiful</p>
<p>faces, from purest blonde to brightest brunette, had never met</p>
<p>and mingled together before.</p>
<p>Each lovely face was unmasked, but Sir Norman&#x27;s dazzled eyes in</p>
<p>vain sought among them for one he knew.  All that &quot;rosebud garden</p>
<p>of girls&quot; were perfect strangers to him, but not so the gallants,</p>
<p>who fluttered among them like moths around meteors.  They, too,</p>
<p>were in gorgeous array, in purple and fine linen, which being</p>
<p>interpreted, signifieth in silken hose of every color under the</p>
<p>sun, spangled and embroidered slippers radiant with diamond</p>
<p>buckles, doublets of as many different shades as their tights,</p>
<p>slashed with satin and embroidered with gold.  Most of them wore</p>
<p>huge powdered wigs, according to the hideous fashion then in</p>
<p>vogue, and under those same ugly scalps, laughed many a handsome</p>
<p>face Sir Norman well knew.  The majority of those richly-robed</p>
<p>gallants were strangers to him as well as the ladies, but whoever</p>
<p>they were, whether mortal men or &quot;spirits from the vasty deep,&quot;</p>
<p>they were in the tallest sort of clover just then.  Evidently</p>
<p>they knew it, too, and seemed to be on the best of terms with</p>
<p>themselves and all the world, and laughed, and flirted, and</p>
<p>flattered, with as mach perfection as so many ball-room Apollos</p>
<p>of the present day.</p>
<p>Still no one ascended the golden and crimson throne, though many</p>
<p>of the ladies and gentlemen fluttering about it were arrayed as</p>
<p>royally as any common king or queen need wish to be.  They</p>
<p>promenaded up and down, arm in arm; they seated themselves in the</p>
<p>carved and gilded chairs; they gathered in little groups to talk</p>
<p>and laugh, did everything, in short, but ascend the throne; and</p>
<p>the solitary spectator up above began to grow intensely curious</p>
<p>to know who it was for.  Their conversation he could plainly</p>
<p>hear, and to say that it amazed him, would be to use a feeble</p>
<p>expression, altogether inadequate to his feelings.  Not that it</p>
<p>was the remarks they made that gave his system each a shook, but</p>
<p>the names by which they addressed each other.  One answered to</p>
<p>the aspiring cognomen of the Duke of Northumberland; another was</p>
<p>the Earl of Leicester; another, the Duke of Devonshire; another,</p>
<p>the Earl of Clarendon; another, the Duke of Buckingham; and so</p>
<p>on, ad infinitum, dukes and earls alternately, like bricks and</p>
<p>mortar in the wall of a house.  There were other dignitaries</p>
<p>besides, some that Sir Norman had a faint recollection of hearing</p>
<p>were dead for some years - Cardinal Wolsey, Sir Thomas More, the</p>
<p>Earl of Bothwell, King Henry Darnley, Sir Walter Raleigh, the</p>
<p>Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Southampton, the Duke of York, and</p>
<p>no end of others with equally sonorous titles.  As for mere lords</p>
<p>and baronets, and such small deer, there was nothing so plebeian</p>
<p>present, and they were evidently looked upon by the distinguished</p>
<p>assembly, like small beer in thunder, with pity and contempt.</p>
<p>The ladies, too, were all duchesses, marchionesses, countesses,</p>
<p>and looked fit for princesses, Sir Norman thought, though he</p>
<p>heard none of them styled quite so high as that.  The tone of</p>
<p>conversation was light and easy, but at the same time extremely</p>
<p>ceremonious and courtly, and all seemed to be enjoying themselves</p>
<p>in the moat delightful sort of a way, which people of, such</p>
<p>distinguished rank, I am told, seldom do.  All went merry as a</p>
<p>marriage-bell, and sweetly over the gay jingle of voices rose the</p>
<p>sweet, faint strains of the unseen music.</p>
<p>Suddenly all was changed.  The great door of glass and gilding</p>
<p>opposite the throne was flung wide, and a grand usher in a grand</p>
<p>court livery flourished a mighty grand wand, and shouted, in a</p>
<p>stentorian voice</p>
<p>&quot;Back: back, ye lieges, and make way for Her Majesty, Queen</p>
<p>Miranda!&quot;</p>
<p>Instantly the unseen band thundered forth the national anthem.</p>
<p>The splendid throng fell back on either hand in profoundest</p>
<p>silence and expectation.  The grand usher mysteriously</p>
<p>disappeared, and in his place there stalked forward a score of</p>
<p>soldiers, with clanking swords and fierce moustaches, in the</p>
<p>gorgeous uniform of the king&#x27;s body-guard.  These showy warriors</p>
<p>arranged themselves silently on either side of the crimson</p>
<p>throne, and were followed by half a dozen dazzling personages,</p>
<p>the foremost crowned with mitre, armed with crozier, and robed in</p>
<p>the ecclesiastical glory of an archbishop, but the face</p>
<p>underneath, to the deep surprise and scandal of Sir Norman, was</p>
<p>that of the fastest young rou? of Charles court, after him came</p>
<p>another pompous dignitary, in such unheard of magnificence that</p>
<p>the unseen looker-on set him down for a prime minister, or a lord</p>
<p>high chancellor, at the very least.  The somewhat gaudy-looking</p>
<p>gentlemen who stepped after the pious prelate and peer wore the</p>
<p>stars and garters of foreign courts, and were evidently</p>
<p>embassadors extraordinary to that of her midnight majesty.  After</p>
<p>them came a snowy flock of fair young girls, angels all but the</p>
<p>wings, slender as sylphs, and robed in purest white.  Each bore</p>
<p>on her arm a basket of flowers, roses and rosebuds of every tint,</p>
<p>from snowy white to darkest crimson, and as they floated in they</p>
<p>scattered them lightly as they went.  And then after all came</p>
<p>another vision, &quot;the last, the brightest, the best - &quot;the</p>
<p>Midnight Queen&quot; herself.  One other figure followed her, and as</p>
<p>they entered, a shout arose from the whole assemblage, &quot;Long live</p>
<p>Queen Miranda!&quot;  And bowing gracefully and easily to the right</p>
<p>end left, the queen with a queenly step, trod the long crimson</p>
<p>carpet and mounted the regal throne.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the first moment of his looking down, Sir Norman had been</p>
</blockquote>
<p>staring with all the eyes in his head, undergoing one shock of</p>
<p>surprise after another with the equanimity of a man quite need to</p>
<p>it; but now a cry arose to his lips, and died there in voiceless</p>
<p>consternation.  For he recognized the queen - well he might! - he</p>
<p>had seen her before, and her face was the face of Leoline!</p>
<p>As she mounted the stairs, she stood there for a moment crowned</p>
<p>and sceptred, before sitting down, and in that moment he</p>
<p>recognized the whole scene.  That gorgeous room and its gorgeous</p>
<p>inmates; that regal throne and its regal owner, all became</p>
<p>palpable as the sun at noonday; that slender, exquisite figure,</p>
<p>robed in royal purple and ermine; the uncovered neck and arms,</p>
<p>snowy and perfect, ablaze with jewels; that lovely face, like</p>
<p>snow, like marble, in its whiteness end calm, with the great,</p>
<p>dark, earnest eyes looking out, and the waving wealth of hair</p>
<p>falling around it.  It was the very scene, and room, and vision,</p>
<p>that La Masque had shown him in the caldron, and that face was</p>
<p>the face of Leoline, and the earl&#x27;s page.</p>
<p>Could he be dreaming?  Was he sane or mad, or were the three</p>
<p>really one?</p>
<p>While he looked, the beautiful queen bowed low, and amid the</p>
<p>profoundest and most respectful silence, took her seat.  In her</p>
<p>robes of purple, wearing the glittering crown, sceptre in hand,</p>
<p>throned and canopied, royally beautiful she looked indeed, and a</p>
<p>most vivid contrast to the gentleman near her, seated very much</p>
<p>at his ease, on the lower throne.  The contrast was not of dress</p>
<ul>
<li>for his outward man was resplendent to look at; but in figure</li>
</ul>
<p>and face, or grace and dignity, he was a very mean specimen of</p>
<p>the lords of creation, indeed.  In stature, he scarcely reached</p>
<p>to the queen&#x27;s royal shoulder, but made up sideways what he</p>
<p>wanted in length - being the breadth of two common men; his head</p>
<p>was in proportion to his width, and was decorated with a wig of</p>
<p>long, flowing, flaxen hair, that scarcely harmonized with a</p>
<p>profusion of the article whiskers, in hue most unmitigated black;</p>
<p>his eyes were small, keen, bright, and piercing, and glared on</p>
<p>the assembled company as they had done half an hour before on Sir</p>
<p>Norman Kingsley, in the bar-room of the Golden Crown; for the</p>
<p>royal little man was no other than Caliban, the dwarf.  Behind</p>
<p>the thrones the flock of floral angels grouped themselves;</p>
<p>archbishop, prime minister, and embassadors, took their stand</p>
<p>within the lines of the soldiery, and the music softly and</p>
<p>impressively died sway in the distance; dead silence reigned.</p>
<p>&quot;My lord Duke,&quot; began the queen, in the very voice he had heard</p>
<p>at the plague-pit, as she turned to the stylish individual next</p>
<p>the archbishop, &quot;come forward and read us the roll of mortality</p>
<p>since our last meeting.?</p>
<p>His grace, the duke, instantly stepped forward, bowing so low</p>
<p>that nothing was seen of him for a brief space, but the small of</p>
<p>his back, and when he reared himself up, after this convulsion of</p>
<p>nature, Sir Norman beheld a face not entirely new to him.  At</p>
<p>first, he could not imagine where he had seen it, but speedily</p>
<p>she recollected it was the identical face of the highwayman who</p>
<p>had beaten an inglorious retreat from him and Count L&#x27;Estrange,</p>
<p>that very night.  This ducat robber drew forth a roll of</p>
<p>parchment, and began reading, in lachrymose tones, a select</p>
<p>litany of defunct gentlemen, with hifalutin titles who had</p>
<p>departed this life during the present week.  Most of them had</p>
<p>gone with the plague, but a few had died from natural causes, and</p>
<p>among these were the Earls of Craven and Ashley.</p>
<p>&quot;My lords Craven and Ashley dead!&quot; exclaimed the queen, in tones</p>
<p>of some surprise, but very little anguish; &quot;that is singular, for</p>
<p>we saw them not two hours ago, in excellent health and spirits.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True, poor majesty,&quot; said the duke, dolefully, &quot;and it is not an</p>
<p>hour since they quitted this vale of tears.  They and myself rode</p>
<p>forth at nightfall, according to Custom, to lay your majesty&#x27;s</p>
<p>tax on all travelers, and soon chanced to encounter one who gave</p>
<p>vigorous battle; still, it would have done him little service,</p>
<p>had not another person come suddenly to his aid, and between them</p>
<p>they clove the skulls of Ashley and Craven; and I,&quot; said the</p>
<p>duke, modestly, &quot;I left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were either of the travelers young, and tall, and of courtly</p>
<p>bearing?&quot; exclaimed the dwarf with sharp rudeness.</p>
<p>&quot;Both were, your highness,&quot; replied the duke, bowing to the small</p>
<p>speaker, &quot;and uncommonly handy with their weapons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw one of them down at the Golden Crown, not long ago,&quot; said</p>
<p>the dwarf; &quot;a forward young popinjay, and mighty inquisitive</p>
<p>about this, our royal palace.  I promised him, if he came here, a</p>
<p>warm reception - a promise I will have the greatest pleasure in</p>
<p>fulfilling&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may stand aside, my lord duke,&quot; said the queen, with a</p>
<p>graceful wave of her hand, &quot;and if any new subjects have been</p>
<p>added to our court since our last weekly meeting, let them come</p>
<p>forward, and be sworn.&quot;</p>
<p>A dozen or mare courtiers immediately stepped forward, and</p>
<p>kneeling before the queen, announced their name and rank, which</p>
<p>were both ambitiously high.  A few silvery-toned questions were</p>
<p>put by that royal lady and satisfactorily answered, and then the</p>
<p>archbishop, armed with a huge tome, administered a severe and</p>
<p>searching oath, which the candidates took with a great deal of</p>
<p>sang frond, and were then permitted to kiss the hand of the queen</p>
<ul>
<li>a privilege worth any amount of swearing - and retire.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Let any one who has any reports to make, make them immediately,&quot;</p>
<p>again commanded her majesty.</p>
<p>A number of gentlemen of high rank, presented themselves at this</p>
<p>summons, and began relating, as a certain sect of Christians do</p>
<p>in church, their experience!  Many of these consisted, to the</p>
<p>deep disapproval of Sir Norman, of accounts of daring highway</p>
<p>robberies, one of them perpetrated on the king himself, which</p>
<p>distinguished personage the duplicate of Leoline styled &quot;our</p>
<p>brother Charles,&quot; and of the sums thereby attained.  The</p>
<p>treasurer of state was then ordered to show himself, and give an</p>
<p>account of the said moneys, which he promptly did; and after him</p>
<p>came a number of petitioners, praying for one thing and another,</p>
<p>some of which the queen promised to grant, and some she didn&#x27;t.</p>
<p>These little affairs of state being over, Miranda turned to the</p>
<p>little gentleman beside her, with the observation</p>
<p>&quot;I believe, your highness, it a on this night the Earl of</p>
<p>Gloucester is to be tried on a charge of high treason, in it</p>
<p>not?&quot;</p>
<p>His highness growled a respectful assent.</p>
<p>&quot;Then let him be brought before us,&quot; said the queen.  &quot;Go,</p>
<p>guards, and fetch him.&quot;</p>
<p>Two of the soldiers bowed low, and backed from the royal</p>
<p>presence, amid dead and ominous silence.  At this interesting</p>
<p>stage of the proceedings, as Sir Norman was leaning forward,</p>
<p>breathless and excited, a footstep sounded on the flagged floor</p>
<p>beside him, and some one suddenly grasped his shoulder with no</p>
<p>gentle hand.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<p>LEOLINE.</p>
<p>In one instant Sir Norman was on his feet and his hand on his</p>
<p>sword.  In the tarry darkness, neither the face nor figure of the</p>
<p>intruder could be made out, but he merely saw a darker shadow</p>
<p>beside him standing in the sea of darkness.  Perhaps he might</p>
<p>have thought it a ghost, but that the hand which grasped his</p>
<p>shoulder was unmistakably of flesh, and blood, and muscle, and</p>
<p>the breathing of its owner was distinctly audible by his ads.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; demanded Sir Norman, drawing out his sword, and</p>
<p>wrenching himself free from his unseen companion.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! it is you, is it?  I thought so,&quot; said a not unknown voice.</p>
<p>&quot;I have been calling you till I am hoarse, and at last gave it</p>
<p>up, and started after you in despair.  What are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You, Ormiston!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, in the last degree</p>
<p>astonished. &quot;How - when - what are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing here?  that&#x27;s more to the purpose.  Down flat</p>
<p>on your face, with your head stuck through that hole.  What is</p>
<p>below there, anyway?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind,&quot; said Sir Norman, hastily, who, for some reason</p>
<p>quite unaccountable to himself, did not wish Ormiston to see.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s nothing therein particular, but a lower range of vaults.</p>
<p>Do you intend telling me what has brought you here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly; the very fleetest horse I could find in the city.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pshaw!  You don&#x27;t say so?&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, incredulously.</p>
<p>&quot;But I presume you had some object in taking such a gallop?  May</p>
<p>I ask what?  Your anxious solicitude on my account, very likely?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not precisely.  But, I say, Kingsley, what light is that shining</p>
<p>through there ?  I mean to see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, you won&#x27;t,&quot; said Sir Norman, rapidly and noiselessly</p>
<p>replacing the flag.  &quot;It&#x27;s nothing, I tell you, but a number of</p>
<p>will-o-&#x27;wisps having a ball.  Finally, and for the last time, Mr.</p>
<p>Ormiston, will you have the goodness to tell me what has sent you</p>
<p>here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come out to the air, then.  I have no fancy for talking in this</p>
<p>place; it smells like a tomb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing wrong, I hope?&quot; inquired Sir Norman, following</p>
<p>his friend, and threading his way gingerly through the piles of</p>
<p>rubbish in the profound darkness.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing wrong, but everything extremely right.  Confound this</p>
<p>place!  It would be easier walking on live eels than through</p>
<p>these winding and lumbered passages.  Thank the fates, we are</p>
<p>through them, at last! for there is the daylight, or, rather the</p>
<p>nightlight, and we have escaped without any bones broken.&quot;</p>
<p>They had reached the mouldering and crumbling doorway, shown by a</p>
<p>square of lighter darkness, and exchanged the damp, chill</p>
<p>atmosphere of the vaults for the stagnant, sultry open air.  Sir</p>
<p>Norman, with a notion in his head that his dwarfish highness</p>
<p>might have placed sentinels around his royal residence,</p>
<p>endeavored to pierce the gloom in search of them.  Though he</p>
<p>could discover none, he still thought discretion the better part</p>
<p>of valor, and stepped out into the road.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, then, where are you going?&quot; inquired Ormiston for,</p>
<p>following him.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t wish to talk here; there is no telling who may be</p>
<p>listening.  Come along.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston glanced back at the gloomy rain looming up like a black</p>
<p>spectre in the blackness.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, they most have a strong fancy for eavesdropping, I must</p>
<p>say, who world go to that haunted heap to listen.  What have you</p>
<p>seen there, and where have you left your horse?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told you before,&quot; said Sir Norman, rather impatiently, &quot;I that</p>
<p>I have seen nothing - at least, nothing you would care about; and</p>
<p>my horse is waiting me at the Golden Crown.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well, we have no time to lose; so get there as fast as you</p>
<p>can, and mount him and ride as if the demon were after you back</p>
<p>to London.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Back to London?  Is the man crazy?  I shall do no such thing,</p>
<p>let me tell you, to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, just as you please,&quot; said Ormiston, with a great deal of</p>
<p>indifference, considering the urgent nature of his former</p>
<p>request.  &quot;You can do as you like, you know, and so can I - which</p>
<p>translated, means, I will go and tell her you have declined to</p>
<p>come.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell her?  Tell whom?  What are you talking about?  Hang it,</p>
<p>man!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, getting somewhat excited and profane,</p>
<p>&quot;what are you driving at?  Can&#x27;t you speak out and tell me at</p>
<p>once?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have told you!&quot; said Ormiston, testily: &quot;and I tell you again,</p>
<p>she sent me in search of you, and if you don&#x27;t choose to come,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s your own affair, and not mine.&quot;</p>
<p>This was a little too mach for Sir Norman&#x27;s overwrought feelings,</p>
<p>and in the last degree of exasperation, he laid violent hands on</p>
<p>the collar of Ormiston&#x27;s doublet let, and shook him as if be</p>
<p>would have shaken the name out with a jerk.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you what it is, Ormiston, you had better not aggravate</p>
<p>me!   I can stand a good deal, but I&#x27;m not exactly Moses or Job,</p>
<p>and you had better mind what you&#x27;re at.  If you don&#x27;t come to the</p>
<p>point at once, and tell me who I she is, I&#x27;ll throttle you where</p>
<p>you stand; and so give you warning.&quot;</p>
<p>Half-indignant, and wholly laughing, Ormiston stepped back out of</p>
<p>the way of his excited friend.</p>
<p>&quot;I cry you mercy!  In one word, then, I have been dispatched by a</p>
<p>lady in search of you, and that lady is - Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>It has always been one of the inscrutable mysteries in natural</p>
<p>philosophy that I never could fathom, why men do not faint.</p>
<p>Certain it is, I never yet heard of s man swooning from excess of</p>
<p>surprise or joy, and perhaps that may account for Sir Norman&#x27;s</p>
<p>not doing so on the present occasion.  But he came to an abrupt</p>
<p>stand-still in their rapid career; and if it had not been quite</p>
<p>so excessively dark, his friend would have beheld a countenance</p>
<p>wonderful to look on, in its mixture of utter astonishment and</p>
<p>sublime consternation.</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline!&quot; he faintly gasped.  &quot;Just atop a moment, Ormiston, and</p>
<p>say that again - will you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Ormiston, hurrying unconcernedly on; &quot;I shall do no</p>
<p>such thing, for there is no time to lose, and if there were I</p>
<p>have no fancy for standing in this dismal road.  Come on, man,</p>
<p>and I&#x27;ll tell you as we go.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus abjured, and seeing there was no help for it, Sir Norman, in</p>
<p>a dazed and bewildered state, complied; and Ormiston promptly and</p>
<p>briskly relaxed into business.</p>
<p>&quot;You see, my dear fellow, to begin at the beginning, after you</p>
<p>left, I stood at ease at La Masque&#x27;s door, awaiting that lady&#x27;s</p>
<p>return, and was presently rewarded by seeing her come up with an</p>
<p>old woman called Prudence.  Do you recollect the woman who rushed</p>
<p>screaming out of the home of the dead bride?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that was Prudence.  She and La Masque were talking so</p>
<p>earnestly they did not perceive me, and I - well, the fast is,</p>
<p>Kingsley, I stayed and listened.  Not a very handsome thing,</p>
<p>perhaps, but I couldn&#x27;t resist it.  They were talking of some one</p>
<p>they called Leoline, and I, in a moment, knew that it was your</p>
<p>flame, and that neither of them knew any more of her whereabouts</p>
<p>than we did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet La Masque told me to come here in search of her,&quot;</p>
<p>interrupted Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;Very true!  That was odd - wasn&#x27;t it?  This Prudence, it</p>
<p>appears, was Leoline&#x27;s nurse, and La Masque, too, seemed to have</p>
<p>a certain authority over her; and between them, I learned she was</p>
<p>to have been married this very night, and died - or, at least,</p>
<p>Prudence thought so - an hour or two before the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then she was not married?&quot; cried Sir Norman, in an ecstasy of</p>
<p>delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit of it; and what is more, didn&#x27;t want to be; and</p>
<p>judging from the remarks of Prudence, I should say, of the two,</p>
<p>rather preferred the plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why was she going to do it?  You don&#x27;t mean to say she was</p>
<p>forced?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, but I do, though!  Prudence owned it with the most charming</p>
<p>candor in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear the name of the person she was to have married?&quot;</p>
<p>asked Sir Norman, with kindling eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I think not; they called him the count, if my memory serves me,</p>
<p>and Prudence intimated that he knew nothing of the melancholy</p>
<p>fate of Mistress Leoline.  Moat likely it was the person in the</p>
<p>cloak and slouched hat we caw talking to the watchman.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman said nothing, but he thought a good deal, and the</p>
<p>burden of his thoughts was an ardent and heartfelt wish that the</p>
<p>Court L&#x27;Estrange was once more under the swords of the three</p>
<p>robbers, and waiting for him to ride to the rescue - that was</p>
<p>all!</p>
<p>&quot;La Masque urged Prudence to go back,&quot; continued Ormiston; &quot;but</p>
<p>Prudence respectfully declined, and went her way bemoaning the</p>
<p>fate of her darling.  When she was gone, I stepped up to Madame</p>
<p>Masque, and that lady&#x27;s first words of greeting were an earnest</p>
<p>hope that I had been edified and improved by what I had</p>
<p>overheard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She saw you, then?&quot; said Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;See me?  I believe you!  She has more eyes than ever Argus had,</p>
<p>and each one is as sharp as a cambric needle.  Of course I</p>
<p>apologized, and so on, and she forgave me handsomely, and then we</p>
<p>fell to discoursing - need I tell you on what subject?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Love, of course,&quot; said Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, mingled with entreaties to take off her mask that would</p>
<p>have moved a heart of atone.  It moved what was better - the</p>
<p>heart of La Masque; and, Kingsley, she has consented to do it;</p>
<p>and she says that if, after seeing her face, I still love her,</p>
<p>she will be my wife.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible?  My dear Ormiston, I congratulate you with all</p>
<p>my heart!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you!  After that she left me, and I walked away in such a</p>
<p>frenzy of delight that I couldn&#x27;t have told whether I was</p>
<p>treading this earth or the shining shares of the seventh heaven,</p>
<p>when suddenly there flew past me a figure all in white - the</p>
<p>figure of a bride, Kingsley, pursued by an excited mob.  We were</p>
<p>both near the river, and the first thing I knew, she was plump</p>
<p>into it, with the crowd behind, yelling to stop her, that she was</p>
<p>ill of the plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Great Heaven! and was she drowned?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, though it was not her fault.  The Earl of Rochester and his</p>
<p>page - you remember that page, I fancy - were out in their barge,</p>
<p>and the earl picked her up.  Then I got a boat, set out after</p>
<p>her, claimed her - for I recognized her, of course - brought her</p>
<p>ashore, and deposited her safe and sound in her own house.  What</p>
<p>do you think of that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ormiston,&quot; said Norman, catching him by the shoulder, with a</p>
<p>very excited face, &quot;is this true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True as preaching, Kingsley, every word of it!  And the most</p>
<p>extraordinary part of the business is, that her dip in cold water</p>
<p>has effectually cured her of the plague; not a trace of it</p>
<p>remains.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman dropped his hand, and walked on, staring straight</p>
<p>before him, perfectly speechless.  In fact, no known language in</p>
<p>the world could have done justice to his feelings at that precise</p>
<p>period; for three times that night, in three different shapes,</p>
<p>had he seen this same Leoline, and at the same moment he was</p>
<p>watching her decked out in royal state in the rain, Ormiston had</p>
<p>probably been assisting her from her cold bath in the river</p>
<p>Thames.</p>
<p>Astonishment and consternation are words altogether too feeble to</p>
<p>express his state of mind; but one idea remained clear and bright</p>
<p>amid all his mental chaos, and that was, that the Leoline he had</p>
<p>fallen in love with dead, was awaiting him, alive and well, in</p>
<p>London.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Ormiston, &quot;you don&#x27;t speak!  What do you think of</p>
<p>all this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Think!  I can&#x27;t think - I&#x27;ve got past that long ago!&quot; replied</p>
<p>his friend, hopelessly.  &quot;Did you really say Leoline was alive</p>
<p>and well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And waiting for you - yes, I did, and I repeat it; and the</p>
<p>sooner you get back to town, the sooner you will see her; so</p>
<p>don&#x27;t loiter - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ormiston, what do you mean! Is it possible I can see her</p>
<p>to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it is; the dear creature is waiting for you even now.  You</p>
<p>see, after we got to the house, and she had consented to become a</p>
<p>little rational, mutual explanations ensued, by which it appeared</p>
<p>she had ran away from Sir Norman Kingsley&#x27;s in a state of frenzy,</p>
<p>had jumped into the river in a similarly excited state of mind,</p>
<p>and was most anxious to go down on her pretty knees and thank the</p>
<p>aforesaid Sir Norman for saving her life.  What could any one as</p>
<p>gallant as myself do under these circumstances, but offer to set</p>
<p>forth in quest of that gentleman?  And she promptly consented to</p>
<p>sit up and wait his coming, and dismissed me with her blessing.</p>
<p>And, Kingsley, I&#x27;ve a private notion she is as deeply affected by</p>
<p>you as you are by her; for, when I mentioned your name, she</p>
<p>blushed, yea, verily to the roots of her hair; and when she spoke</p>
<p>of you, couldn&#x27;t so much as look me in the face - which is, yea</p>
<p>must own, a very bad symptom.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; said Sir Norman, energetically.  And had it been</p>
<p>daylight, his friend would have seen that he blushed almost as</p>
<p>extensively as the lady.  &quot;She doesn&#x27;t know me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, doesn&#x27;t she, though?  That shows all you know about it!  She</p>
<p>has seen you go past the window many and many a time; and to see</p>
<p>you,&quot; said Ormiston, making a grimace undercover of the darkness,</p>
<p>&quot;is to love!  She told me so herself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!  That she loved me!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, his notions of</p>
<p>propriety to the last degree shocked by such a revelation.</p>
<p>&quot;Not altogether, she only looked that; but she said she knew you</p>
<p>well by sight, and by heart, too, as I inferred from her</p>
<p>countenance when she said it.  There now, don&#x27;t make me talk any</p>
<p>more, for I have told you everything I know, and am about hoarse</p>
<p>with my exertions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One thing only - did she tell you who she was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, except that her name was Leoline, and nothing else - which</p>
<p>struck me as being slightly improbable.  Doubtless, she will tell</p>
<p>you everything, and one piece of advice I may venture to give</p>
<p>you, which is, you may propose as soon as you like without fear</p>
<p>of rejection.  Here we are at the Golden Crown, so go in and get</p>
<p>your horse, and let us be off.&quot;</p>
<p>All this time Ormiston had been leading his own horse by the</p>
<p>bridle, and as Sir Norman silently complied with this suggestion,</p>
<p>in five minutes more they were in their saddles, and galloping at</p>
<p>breakneck speed toward the city.  To tell the truth, one was not</p>
<p>more inclined for silence than the other, and the profoundest and</p>
<p>thoughtfulest silence was maintained till they reached it.  One</p>
<p>was thinking of Leoline, the other of La Masque, and both were</p>
<p>badly in love, and just at that particular moment very happy.  Of</p>
<p>course the happiness of people in that state never lasts longer</p>
<p>than half an hour at a stretch, and then they are plunged back</p>
<p>again into misery and distraction; but while it does last, it in,</p>
<p>very intense and delightful indeed.</p>
<p>Our two friends having drained the bitten, had got to the bottom</p>
<p>of the cup, and neither knew that no sooner were the sweets</p>
<p>swallowed, than it was to be replenished with a doubly-bitter</p>
<p>dose.  Neither of them dismounted till they reached the house of</p>
<p>Leoline, and there Sir Norman secured his horse, and looked up at</p>
<p>it with a beating heart.  Not that it was very unusual for his</p>
<p>heart to beat, seeing it never did anything else; but on that</p>
<p>occasion its motion was so mush accelerated, that any doctor</p>
<p>feeling his pulse might have justly set him down as a bad case of</p>
<p>heart-disease.  A small, bright ray of light streamed like a</p>
<p>beacon of hope from an upper window, and the lover looked at it</p>
<p>as a clouded mariner might at the shining of the North Star.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you coming in, Ormiston?&quot; he inquired, feeling, for the</p>
<p>first time in his life, almost bashful.  &quot;It seems to me it would</p>
<p>only be right, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t mind going in and introducing` you,&quot; said Ormiston; &quot;but</p>
<p>after you have been delivered over, you may fight poor own</p>
<p>battles, and take care of yourself.  Come on.&quot;</p>
<p>The door was unfastened, and Ormiston sprang upstairs with the</p>
<p>air of a man-quite at home, followed more decorously by Sir</p>
<p>Norman.  The door of the lady&#x27;s room stood ajar, as he had left</p>
<p>it, and in answer to his &quot;tapping at the chamber-door,&quot; a sweet</p>
<p>feminine voice called &quot;come in.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston promptly obeyed, and the next instant they were in the</p>
<p>room, and in the presence of the dead bride.  Certainly she did</p>
<p>not look dead, but very much alive, just then, as she sat in an</p>
<p>easy-chair, drawn up before the dressing-table, on which stood</p>
<p>the solitary lamp that illumed the chamber.  In one hand she held</p>
<p>a small mirror, or, as it was then called, a &quot;sprunking-glass,&quot;</p>
<p>in which she was contemplating her own beauty, with as much</p>
<p>satisfaction as any other pretty girl might justly do.  She had</p>
<p>changed her drenched dress during Ormiston&#x27;s absence, and now sat</p>
<p>arrayed in a swelling amplitude of rose-colored satin, her dark</p>
<p>hair clasped and bound by a circle of milk-white pearls, and her</p>
<p>pale, beautiful face looking ten degrees more beautiful than</p>
<p>ever, in contrast with the bright rose-silk, shining dark hair,</p>
<p>and rich white jewels.  She rose up as they entered, and came</p>
<p>forward with the same glow on her face and the same light in her</p>
<p>eyes that one of them had seen before, and stood with drooping</p>
<p>eyelashes, lovely as a vision in the centre of the room.</p>
<p>&quot;You see I have lost no time in obeying your ladyship&#x27;s</p>
<p>commands,&quot; began Ormiston, bowing low.  &quot;Mistress Leoline, allow</p>
<p>me to present Sir Norman Kingsley.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman Kingsley bent almost as profoundly before the lady as</p>
<p>the lord high chancellor had done before Queen Miranda; and the</p>
<p>lady courtesied, in return, until her pink-satin skirt ballooned</p>
<p>out all over the floor.  It was quite an affecting tableau.  And</p>
<p>so Ormiston felt, as he stood eyeing it with preternatural</p>
<p>gravity.</p>
<p>&quot;I owe my life to Sir Norman Kingsley,&quot; murmured the faint, sweet</p>
<p>voice of the lady, &quot;and could not rest until I had thanked him.</p>
<p>I have no words to say how deeply thankful and grateful I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fairest Leoline! one word from such lips would be enough to</p>
<p>repay me, had I done a thousandfold more,&quot; responded Norman,</p>
<p>laying his hand on his heart, with another deep genuflection.</p>
<p>&quot;Very pretty indeed!&quot; remarked Ormiston to himself, with a little</p>
<p>approving nod; &quot;but I&#x27;m afraid they won&#x27;t be able to keep it up,</p>
<p>and go on talking on stilts like that, till they have finished.</p>
<p>Perhaps they may get on all the better if I take myself off,</p>
<p>there being always one too many in a case like this.&quot;  Then</p>
<p>aloud: &quot;Madame, I regret that I am obliged to depart, having a</p>
<p>most particular appointment; but, doubtless, my friend will be</p>
<p>able to express himself without my assistance.  I have the honor</p>
<p>to wish you both good-night.&quot;</p>
<p>With which neat and appropriate speech, Ormiston bowed himself</p>
<p>out, and was gone before Leoline could detain him, even if she</p>
<p>wished to do so.  Probably, however, she thought the care of one</p>
<p>gentleman sufficient responsibility at once; and she did not look</p>
<p>very seriously distressed by his departure; and, the moment he</p>
<p>disappeared, Sir Norman brightened up wonderfully.</p>
<p>It is very discomposing to the feelings to make love in the</p>
<p>presence of a third party; and Sir Norman had no intention of</p>
<p>wasting his time on anything, and went at it immediately.  Taking</p>
<p>her hand, with a grace that would have beaten Sir Charles</p>
<p>Grandison or Lord Chesterfield all to nothing, he led her to a</p>
<p>couch, and took a seat as near her as was at all polite or</p>
<p>proper, considering the brief nature of their acquaintance.  The</p>
<p>curtains were drawn; the lamp shed a faint light; the house was</p>
<p>still, and there was no intrusive papa to pounce down upon them;</p>
<p>the lady was looking down, and seemed in no way haughty or</p>
<p>discouraging, and Sir Norman&#x27;s spirits went up with a jump to</p>
<p>boiling-point.</p>
<p>Yet the lady, with all her pretty bashfulness, was the first to</p>
<p>speak.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m afraid, Sir Norman, you must think this a singular hour to</p>
<p>come here; but, in these dreadful times, we cannot tell if we may</p>
<p>live from one moment to another; and I should not like to die, or</p>
<p>have you die, without my telling, and you hearing, all my</p>
<p>gratitude.  For I do assure you, Sir Norman,&quot; said the lady,</p>
<p>lifting her dark eyes with the prettiest and moat bewitching</p>
<p>earnestness, &quot;that I am grateful, though I cannot find words to</p>
<p>express it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I would not listen to you it you would; for I have done</p>
<p>nothing to deserve thanks.  I wish I could tell you what I felt</p>
<p>when Ormiston told me you were alive and safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are very kind, but pray do not call me madame.  Say</p>
<p>Leoline!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A thousand thanks, dear Leoline!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, raising</p>
<p>her hand to his lips, and quite beside himself with ecstasy.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, I did not tell you to say that!&quot; she cried, with a gay laugh</p>
<p>and vivid blush.  &quot;I never said you were to call me dear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It arose from my heart to my lips,&quot; said Sir Norman, with</p>
<p>thrilling earnestness and fervid glance; &quot;for you are dear to me</p>
<ul>
<li>dearer than all the world beside!&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The flush grew a deeper glow on the lady&#x27;s face; but, singular to</p>
<p>relate, she did not look the least surprised or displeased; and</p>
<p>the hand he had feloniously purloined lay passive and quite</p>
<p>contented in his.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley is pleased to jest,&quot; said the lady, in a</p>
<p>subdued tone, and with her eyes fixed pertinaciously on her</p>
<p>shining dress; &quot;for he has never spoken to me before in his</p>
<p>life!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That has nothing to do with it, Leoline.  I love you as</p>
<p>devotedly as if I had known you from your birthday; and, strange</p>
<p>to say, I feel as if we had been friends for years instead of</p>
<p>minutes.  I cannot realize at all that you are a stranger to me!&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline laughed:</p>
<p>&quot;Nor I; though, for that matter, you are not a stranger to me,</p>
<p>Sir Norman!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I not?  How is that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen you go past so often, you know; and Prudence told me</p>
<p>who you were; and so I need - I used - &quot; hesitating and glowing</p>
<p>to a degree before which her dress paled.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, dearest,&quot; said Sir Norman, getting from the positive to</p>
<p>the superlative at a jump, and diminishing the distance between</p>
<p>them, &quot;you need to - what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To watch for you!&quot; said Leoline, in a sly whisper.  &quot;And so I</p>
<p>have got to know you very well!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My own darling!  And, O Leoline! may I hope - dare I hope - that</p>
<p>you do not altogether hate me?&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline looked reflective; though her bleak eyes were sparkling</p>
<p>under their sweeping lashes.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, no,&quot; she said, demurely, &quot;I don&#x27;t know as I do.  It&#x27;s very</p>
<p>sinful and improper to hate one&#x27;s fellow-creatures, you know, Sir</p>
<p>Norman, and therefore I don&#x27;t indulge in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you are given to piety, I see.  In that case, perhaps you</p>
<p>are aware of a precept commanding us to love our neighbors.  Now,</p>
<p>I&#x27;m your nearest neighbor at present; so, to keep up a consistent</p>
<p>Christian spirit, just be good enough to say you love me!&quot;</p>
<p>Again Leoline laughed; and this time the bright, dancing eyes</p>
<p>beamed in their sparkling darkness fall upon him.</p>
<p>&quot;I am afraid your theology is not very sound, my friend, and I</p>
<p>have a dislike to extremes.  There is a middle course, between</p>
<p>hating and loving.  Suppose I take that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will have no middle courses - either hating or loving it must</p>
<p>be!  Leoline!  Leoline!&quot; (bending over her, and imprisoning both</p>
<p>hands this time) &quot;do say you love me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am captive in your hands, so I must, I suppose.  Yes, Sir</p>
<p>Norman, I do love you!&quot;</p>
<p>Every man hearing that for the first time from a pair of loved</p>
<p>lips is privileged to go mad for a brief season, and to go</p>
<p>through certain manoeuvers much more delectable to the enjoyers</p>
<p>than to society at large.  For fully ten minutes after Leoline&#x27;s</p>
<p>last speech, there was profound silence.  But actions sometimes</p>
<p>speak louder than words; and Leoline was perfectly convinced that</p>
<p>her declaration had not fallen on insensible ears.  At the end of</p>
<p>that period, the space between them on the couch had so greatly</p>
<p>diminished, that the ghost of a zephyr would have been crushed to</p>
<p>death trying to get between them; and Sir Norman&#x27;s face was</p>
<p>fairly radiant.  Leoline herself looked rather beaming; and she</p>
<p>suddenly, and without provocation, burst into a merry little peal</p>
<p>of laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, for two people who were perfect strangers to each other</p>
<p>half an hour ago, I think we have gone on remarkably well.  What</p>
<p>will Mr. Ormiston and Prudence say, I wonder, when they hear</p>
<p>this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They will say what is the truth - that I am the luckiest man in</p>
<p>England.  O Leoline!  I never thought it was in me to love any</p>
<p>one as I do you.&quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;I am very glad to hear it; but I knew that it was in me long</p>
<p>before I ever dreamed of knowing you.  Are you not anxious to</p>
<p>know something about the future Lady Kingsley&#x27;s past history?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will all come in good time; it is not well to have a surfeit</p>
<p>of joy in one night.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know that this will add to your joy; but it had better</p>
<p>be told and be done with, at once and forever.  In the first</p>
<p>place, I presume I am an orphan, for I have never known father or</p>
<p>mother, and I have never had any other name but Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So Ormiston told me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My first recollection is of Prudence; she was my nurse and</p>
<p>governess, both in one; and we lived in a cottage by the sea - I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know where, but a long way from this.  When I was about ten</p>
<p>years old, we left it, and came to London, and lived in a house</p>
<p>in Cheapside, for five or six years; and then we moved here.  And</p>
<p>all this time, Sir Norman you will think it strange - but I never</p>
<p>made any friends or acquaintances, and knew no one but Prudence</p>
<p>and an old Italian professor, who came to our lodgings in</p>
<p>Cheapside, every week, to give me lessons.  It was not because I</p>
<p>disliked society, you must know; but Prudence, with all her</p>
<p>kindness and goodness - and I believe she truly loves me - has</p>
<p>been nothing more or less all my life than my jailer.&quot;</p>
<p>She paused to clasp a belt of silver brocade, fastened by a pearl</p>
<p>buckle, close around her little waist, and Sir Norman fixed his</p>
<p>eyes upon her beautiful face, with a powerful glance.</p>
<p>&quot;Knew no one - that is strange, Leoline!  Not even the Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you know him?&quot; she cried eagerly, lifting her eyes with a</p>
<p>bright look; &quot;do - do tell me who he is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Upon my honor, my dear,&quot; said Sir Norman, considerably taken</p>
<p>aback, &quot;it strikes me you are the person to answer that question.</p>
<p>If I don&#x27;t greatly mistake, somebody told me you were going to</p>
<p>marry him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, so I was,&quot; said Leoline, with the utmost simplicity.  &quot;But I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t know him, for all that; and more than that, Sir Norman, I</p>
<p>do not believe his name is Count L&#x27;Estrange, any more than mine</p>
<p>in!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Precisely my opinion; but why, in the name of  - no, I&#x27;ll not</p>
<p>swear; but why were you going to marry him, Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline half pouted, and shrugged her pretty pink satin</p>
<p>shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Because I couldn&#x27;t help it - that&#x27;s why.  He coaxed, and coaxed;</p>
<p>and I said no, and no, and no, until I got tired of it.</p>
<p>Prudence, too, was as bad as he was, until between them I got</p>
<p>about distracted, and at last consented to marry him to get rid</p>
<p>of him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My poor, persecuted little darling! Oh,&quot; cried Sir Norman, with</p>
<p>a burst of enthusiasm, &quot;how I should admire to have Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange here for about tea minutes, just now!  I world spoil</p>
<p>his next wooing for him, or I am mistaken!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no!&quot; said Leoline, looking rather alarmed; &quot;you must not</p>
<p>fight, you know.  I shouldn&#x27;t at all like either of you to get</p>
<p>killed.  Besides, he has not married me; and so there&#x27;s no harm</p>
<p>done.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman seemed rather struck by that view of the case, and</p>
<p>after a few moments reflection on it, came to the conclusion that</p>
<p>she knew best, and settled down peaceably again.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you suppose his name is not Count L&#x27;Estrange?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;For many reasons.  First - he is disguised; wears false</p>
<p>whiskers, moustache, and wig, and even the voice he uses appears</p>
<p>assumed.  Then Prudence seems in the greatest awe of him, and she</p>
<p>is not one to be easily awed.  I never knew her to be in the</p>
<p>slightest degree intimidated by any human being but himself and</p>
<p>that mysterious woman, La Masque.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you know La Masque, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not personally; but I have seen her as I did you, you remember,&quot;</p>
<p>with an arch glance; &quot;and, like you, being once seen, is not to</p>
<p>be forgotten.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman promptly paid her for the compliment in Cupid&#x27;s own</p>
<p>coin:</p>
<p>&quot;Little flatterer! I can almost forgive Count L&#x27;Estrange for</p>
<p>wanting to marry you; for I presume he it only a man, and not</p>
<p>quite equal to impossibilities.  How long is it since you knew</p>
<p>him first?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not two months.  My courtships,&quot; said Leoline, with a gay laugh,</p>
<p>&quot;seem destined to be of the shortest.  He saw me one evening in</p>
<p>the window, and immediately insisted on being admitted; and after</p>
<p>that, he continued coming until I had to promise, as I have told</p>
<p>you, to be Countess L&#x27;Estrange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He cannot be mach of a gentleman, or he would not attempt to</p>
<p>force a lady against her will.  And so, when you were dressed for</p>
<p>your bridal, you found you had the plague?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sir Norman; and horrible as that was I do assure you I</p>
<p>almost preferred it to marrying him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline, tell me how long it is since you&#x27;ve known me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nearly three months,&quot; said Leoline, blushing again celestial</p>
<p>rosy red.</p>
<p>&quot;And how long have you loved me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense.  What a question! I shall not tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shall - you must - I insist upon it.  Did you love me before</p>
<p>you met the count?  Out with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then - yes!&quot; cried Leoline desperately.</p>
<p>Sir Norman raised the hand he held, is rapture to his lips:</p>
<p>&quot;My darling!  But I will reserve my raptures, for it is growing</p>
<p>late, and I know you mast want to go to rest.  I have a thousand</p>
<p>things to tell you, but they must wait for daylight; only I will</p>
<p>promise, before parting, that this is the last night you mast</p>
<p>spend here.&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline opened her bright eyes very wide.</p>
<p>&quot;To-morrow morning,&quot; went on Sir Norman, impressively, and with</p>
<p>dignity, &quot;you will be up and dressed by sunrise, and shortly</p>
<p>after that radiant period, I will make my appearance with two</p>
<p>horses - one of which I shall ride, and the other I shall lead:</p>
<p>the one I lead you shall mount, and we will ride to the nearest</p>
<p>church, and be married without any pomp or pageant; and then Sir</p>
<p>Norman and Lady Kingsley will immediately leave London, and in</p>
<p>Kingsley Castle, Devonshire, will enjoy the honeymoon and</p>
<p>blissful repose till the plague is over.  Do you understand</p>
<p>that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perfectly,&quot; she answered, with a radiant face.</p>
<p>&quot;And agree to it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know I do, Sir Norman; only - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my pet, only what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman, I should like to see Prudence.  I want Prudence.</p>
<p>How can I leave her behind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear child, she made nothing of leaving you when she thought</p>
<p>you were dying; so never mind Prudence, but say, will you be</p>
<p>ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is my good little Leoline.  Now give me a kiss, Lady</p>
<p>Kingsley, and good-night.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Kingsley dutifully obeyed; and Sir Norman went out with a</p>
<p>glow at his heart, like a halo round a full moon.</p>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<p>THE PAGE, THE FIRES, AND THE FALL.</p>
<p>The night was intensely dark when Sir Norman got into it once</p>
<p>more; and to any one else would have been intensely dismal, but</p>
<p>to Sir Norman all was bright as the fair hills of Beulah.  When</p>
<p>all is bright within, we see no darkness without; and just at</p>
<p>that moment our young knight had got into one of those green and</p>
<p>golden glimpses of sunshine that here and there checker life&#x27;s</p>
<p>rather dark pathway, and with Leoline beside him would have</p>
<p>thought the dreary whores of the Dead Sea itself a very paradise.</p>
<p>It was now near midnight, and there was an unusual concourse of</p>
<p>people in the sheets, waiting for St. Paul&#x27;s to give the signal</p>
<p>to light the fires.  He looked around for Ormiston; but Ormiston</p>
<p>was nowhere to be seen - horse and rider had disappeared.  His</p>
<p>own horse stood tethered where he had left him.  Anxious as he</p>
<p>was to ride back to the ruin, and see the play played out, he</p>
<p>could not resist the temptation of lingering a brief period in</p>
<p>the city, to behold the grand spectacle of the myriad fires.</p>
<p>Many persons were hurrying toward St. Paul&#x27;s to witness it from</p>
<p>the dome; and consigning his horse to the care of the sentinel on</p>
<p>guard at the house opposite, he joined them, and was soon</p>
<p>striding along, at a tremendous pace, toward the great cathedral.</p>
<p>Ere he reached it, its long-tongued clock tolled twelve, and all</p>
<p>the other churches, one after another, took up the sound, and the</p>
<p>witching hour of midnight rang and rerang from end to end of</p>
<p>London town.  As if by magic, a thousand forked tongues of fire</p>
<p>shot up at once into the blind, black night, turning almost in an</p>
<p>instant the darkened face of the heavens to an inflamed, glowing</p>
<p>red.  Great fires were blazing around the cathedral when they</p>
<p>reached it, but no one stopped to notice them, but only hurried</p>
<p>on the faster to gain their point of observation.</p>
<p>Sir Norman just glanced at the magnificent pile - for the old St.</p>
<p>Paul&#x27;s was even more magnificent than the new, - and then</p>
<p>followed after the rest, through many a gallery, tower, and</p>
<p>spiral staircase till the dome was reached.  And there a grand</p>
<p>and mighty spectacle was before him - the whole of London swaying</p>
<p>and heaving in one great sea of fire.  From one end to the other,</p>
<p>the city seemed wrapped in sheets of flame, and every street, and</p>
<p>alley, and lane within it shone in a lurid radiance far brighter</p>
<p>than noonday.  All along the river fires were gleaming, too; and</p>
<p>the whole sky had turned from black to blood-red crimson.  The</p>
<p>streets were alive and swarming - it could scarcely be believed</p>
<p>that the plague-infested city contained half so many people, and</p>
<p>all were unusually hopeful and animated; for it was popularly</p>
<p>believed that these fires would effectually check the pestilence.</p>
<p>But the angry fiat of a Mighty Judge had gone forth, and the</p>
<p>tremendous arm of the destroying angel was not to be stopped by</p>
<p>the puny hand of man.</p>
<p>It has been said the weather for weeks was unusually brilliant,</p>
<p>days of cloudless sunshine, nights of cloudless moonlight, and</p>
<p>the air was warm and sultry enough for the month of August in the</p>
<p>tropics.  But now, while they looked, a vivid flash of lightning,</p>
<p>from what quarter of the heavens no man knew, shot athwart the</p>
<p>sky, followed by another and another, quick, sharp, and blinding.</p>
<p>Then one great drop of rain fell like molten lead on the</p>
<p>pavement, then a second and a third quicker, faster, and thicker,</p>
<p>until down it crashed in a perfect deluge.  It did not wait to</p>
<p>rain; it fell in floods - in great, slanting sheets of water, an</p>
<p>if the very floodgates of heaven had opened for a second deluge.</p>
<p>No one ever remembered to have seen such torrents fall, and the</p>
<p>populace fled before it in wildest dismay.  In five minutes,</p>
<p>every fire, from one extremity of London to the other, was</p>
<p>quenched in the very blackness of darkness, and on that night the</p>
<p>deepest gloom and terror reigned throughout the city.  It was</p>
<p>clear the hand of an avenging Deity was in this, and He who had</p>
<p>rained down fire on Sodom and Gomorrah had not lost His might.</p>
<p>In fifteen minutes the terrific flood was over; the dismal clouds</p>
<p>cleared away, a pale, fair, silver moon shone serenely out, and</p>
<p>looked down on the black, charred heaps of ashes strewn through</p>
<p>the streets of London.  One by one, the stars that all night had</p>
<p>been obscured, glanced and sparkled over the sky, and lit up with</p>
<p>their soft, pale light the doomed and stricken town.  Everybody</p>
<p>had quitted the dome in terror and consternation; and now Sir</p>
<p>Norman, who had been lost in awe, suddenly bethought him of his</p>
<p>ride to the ruin, and hastened to follow their example.  Walking</p>
<p>rapidly, not to say recklessly, along, he abruptly knocked</p>
<p>against some one sauntering leisurely before him, and nearly</p>
<p>pitched headlong on the pavement.  Recovering his centre of</p>
<p>gravity by a violent effort, he turned to see the cause of the</p>
<p>collision, and found himself accosted by a musical and</p>
<p>foreign-accented voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon,&quot; paid the sweet, and rather feminine tones; &quot;it was</p>
<p>quite an accident, I assure you, monsieur.  I had no idea I was</p>
<p>in anybody&#x27;s way.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman looked at the voice, or rather in the direction whence</p>
<p>it came, and found it proceeded from a lad in gay livery, whose</p>
<p>clear, colorless face, dark eyes, end exquisite features were by</p>
<p>no means unknown.  The boy seemed to recognize him at the same</p>
<p>moment, and slightly touched his gay cap.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! it is Sir Norman Kingsley!  Just the very person, but one,</p>
<p>in the world that I wanted most to see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed!  And, pray, whom have I the honor of addressing?&quot;</p>
<p>inquired Sir Norman, deeply edified by the cool familiarity of</p>
<p>the accoster.</p>
<p>&quot;They call me Hubert - for want of a better name, I suppose,&quot;</p>
<p>said the lad, easily.  &quot;And may I ask, Sir Norman, if you are</p>
<p>shod with seven-leagued boots, or if your errand is one of life</p>
<p>and death, that you stride along at such a terrific rate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is that to you?&quot; asked Sir Norman, indignant at his</p>
<p>free-and-easy impudence.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing; only I should like to keep up with you, if my legs were</p>
<p>long enough; and as they&#x27;re not, and as company is not easily to</p>
<p>be had in these forlorn streets, I should feel obliged to you if</p>
<p>you would just slacken your pace a trifle, and take me in tow.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy&#x27;s face in the moonlight, in everything but expression,</p>
<p>was exactly that of Leoline, to which softening circumstance may</p>
<p>be attributed Sir Norman&#x27;s yielding to the request, and allowing</p>
<p>the page to keep along side.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve met you once before to-night?&quot; inquired Sir Norman, after a</p>
<p>prolonged and wondering stare at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; I have a faint recollection of seeing you and Mr. Ormiston</p>
<p>on London Bridge, a few hours ago, and, by the way, perhaps I may</p>
<p>mention I am now in search of that same Mr. Ormiston.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are!  And what may you want of him, pray?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just a little information of a private character - perhaps you</p>
<p>can direct me to his whereabouts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Should be happy to oblige you, my dear boy, but, unfortunately,</p>
<p>I cannot.  I want to see him myself, if I could find any one good</p>
<p>enough to direct me to him.  Is your business pressing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very - there is a lady in the case; and such business, you are</p>
<p>aware, is always pressing.  Probably you have heard of her - a</p>
<p>youthful angel, in virgin white, who took a notion to jump into</p>
<p>the Thames, not a great while ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Sir Norman, with a start that did not escape the quick</p>
<p>eyes of the boy.  &quot;And what do you want of her?&quot;</p>
<p>The page glanced at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you know her yourself, sir Norman?  If so, you will</p>
<p>answer quite as well as your friend, as I only want to know where</p>
<p>she lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have been out of town to-night,&quot; said Sir Norman, evasively,</p>
<p>&quot;and there may have been more ladies than one jumped into the</p>
<p>Thames, daring my absence.  Pray, describe your angel in white.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not notice her particularly myself,&quot; said the boy, with</p>
<p>easy indifference, &quot;as I am not in the habit of paying much</p>
<p>attention to young ladies who run wild about the streets at night</p>
<p>and jump promiscuously into rivers.  However, this one was rather</p>
<p>remarkable, for being dressed as a bride, having long black hair,</p>
<p>and a great quantity of jewelry about her, and looking very much</p>
<p>like me.  Having said she looks like me, I need not add she is</p>
<p>handsome.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vanity of vanities, all in vanity !&quot; murmured Sir Norman,</p>
<p>meditatively.  &quot;Perhaps she is a relative of yours, Master</p>
<p>Hubert, since you take such an interest in her, and she looks so</p>
<p>much like you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not that I know of,&quot; said Hubert, in his careless way.  &quot;I</p>
<p>believe I was born minus those common domestic afflictions,</p>
<p>relatives; and I don&#x27;t take the slightest interest in her,</p>
<p>either; don&#x27;t think it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why are you in search of her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For a very good reason - because I&#x27;ve been ordered to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By whom - your master?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord Rochester,&quot; said that nobleman&#x27;s page, waving off the</p>
<p>insinuation by a motion of his hand and a little displeased</p>
<p>frown; &quot;he picked her up adrift, and being composed of highly</p>
<p>inflammable materials, took a hot and vehement fancy for her,</p>
<p>which fact he did not discover until your friend, Mr. Ormiston,</p>
<p>had carried her off.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman scowled.</p>
<p>&quot;And so he sent you in search of her, has he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly so; and now you perceive the reason why it is quite</p>
<p>important that I find Mr. Ormiston.  We do not know where he has</p>
<p>taken her to, but fancy it must be somewhere near the river.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You do?  I tell you what it is, my boy,&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman,</p>
<p>suddenly and in an elevated key, &quot;the best thing you can do is,</p>
<p>to go home and go to bed, and never mind young ladies.  You&#x27;ll</p>
<p>catch the plague before you&#x27;ll catch this particular young lady -</p>
<p>I can tell you that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur is excited,&quot; lisped the lad raining his hat end running</p>
<p>his taper fingers through his glossy, dark curls.  &quot;Is she as</p>
<p>handsome as they say she is, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Handsome!&quot; cried Sir Norman, lighting up with quite a new</p>
<p>sensation at the recollection.  &quot;I tell you handsome doesn&#x27;t</p>
<p>begin to describe her!  She is beautiful, lovely, angelic, divine</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;  Here Sir Norman&#x27;s litany of adjectives beginning to give</li>
</ul>
<p>out, he came to a sudden halt, with a face as radiant as the sky</p>
<p>at sunrise.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!  I did not believe them, when they told me she was so much</p>
<p>like me; but if she in as near perfection as you describe, I</p>
<p>shall begin to credit it.  Strange, is it not, that nature should</p>
<p>make a duplicate of her greatest earthly chef d&#x27;oeuvre?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You conceited young jackanapes!&quot; growled Sir Norman, in deep</p>
<p>displeasure.  &quot;It is far stranger how such a bundle of vanity can</p>
<p>contrive to live in this work-a-day world.  You are a foreigner,</p>
<p>I perceive?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sir Norman, I am happy to say I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t like England, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;d be sorry to like it; a dirty, beggarly, sickly place as I</p>
<p>ever saw!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman eyed the slender specimen of foreign manhood, uttering</p>
<p>this sentiment is the sincerest of tones, and let his hand fall</p>
<p>heavily on his shoulder</p>
<p>&quot;My good youth, be careful!  I happen to be a native, and not</p>
<p>altogether used to this sort of talk.  How long have you been</p>
<p>here?  Not long, I know myself - at least, not in the Earl of</p>
<p>Rochester&#x27;s service, or I would have seen you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right!  I have not been here a month; but that month hag seemed</p>
<p>longer than a year elsewhere.  Do you know, I imagine when the</p>
<p>world was created, this island of yours must have been made late</p>
<p>on Saturday night, and then merely thrown in from the refuse to</p>
<p>fill up a dent in the ocean.</p>
<p>Sir Norman paused in his walk, and contemplated the speaker a</p>
<p>moment in severest silence.  But Master Hubert only lifted up his</p>
<p>saucy face and laughing black eyes, in dauntless sang froid.</p>
<p>&quot;Master Hubert,&quot; began Master Hubert&#x27;s companion, in his deepest</p>
<p>and sternest base, &quot;I don&#x27;t know your other name, and it would be</p>
<p>of no consequence if I did - just listen to me a moment.  If you</p>
<p>don&#x27;t want to get run through (you perceive I carry a sword), and</p>
<p>have an untimely end put to your career, just keep a civil tongue</p>
<p>in your head, and don&#x27;t slander England.  Now come on!&quot;</p>
<p>Hubert laughed and shrugged his shoulders:</p>
<p>&quot;Thought is free, however, so I can have my own opinion in spite</p>
<p>of everything.  Will you tell me, monsieur, where I can find the</p>
<p>lady?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will have it, will you?&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, half drawing</p>
<p>his sword.  &quot;Don&#x27;t ask questions, but answer them.  Are you</p>
<p>French?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur has guessed it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long have you been with your present master?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur, I object to that term,&quot; said Hubert, with calm</p>
<p>dignity.  &quot;Master is a vulgarism that I dislike; so, in alluding</p>
<p>to his lordship, take the trouble to say, patron.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;With all my heart!  How long, then, have you been with your</p>
<p>present patron?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite two weeks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not like to be impertinently inquisitive in addressing so</p>
<p>dignified a gentleman, but perhaps you would not consider it too</p>
<p>great a liberty, if I inquired how you became his page?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur shall ask as many questions as he pleases, and it shall</p>
<p>not be considered the slightest liberty,&quot; said the young</p>
<p>gentleman, politely.  &quot;I had been roaming at large about the city</p>
<p>and the palace of his majesty - whom may Heaven preserve, and</p>
<p>grant a little more wisdom! - in search of a situation; and among</p>
<p>that of all nobles of the court, the Earl of Rochester&#x27;s livery</p>
<p>struck me as being the moat becoming, and so I concluded to</p>
<p>patronize him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What an honor for his lordship!  Since you dislike England so</p>
<p>much, however, you will probably soon throw up the situation and,</p>
<p>patronize the first foreign ambassador - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps!  I rather like Whitehall, however.  Old Rowlie has</p>
<p>taken rather a fancy to me,&quot; said the boy speaking with the same</p>
<p>easy familiarity of his majesty as he would of a lap-dog.  &quot; And</p>
<p>what is better, so has Mistress Stewart - so much so, that Heaven</p>
<p>forefend the king should become jealous.  This, however, is</p>
<p>strictly entra nous, and not to be spoken of on any terms.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your secret shall be preserved at the risk of my life,&quot; said Sir</p>
<p>Norman, laying his hand on the left side of his doublet; &quot;and in</p>
<p>return, may I ask if you have any relatives living - any sisters</p>
<p>for instance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see I you have a suspicion that the lady in white may be a</p>
<p>sister of mine.  Well, you may set your mind at rest on that</p>
<p>point - for if she is, it is news to me, as I never saw her in my</p>
<p>life before tonight.  Is she a particular friend of yours, Sir</p>
<p>Norman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never you mind that, my dear boy; but take my advice, and don&#x27;t</p>
<p>trouble yourself looking for her; for, most assuredly, if you</p>
<p>find her, I shall break your head!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Much obliged,&quot; said Hubert, touching his cap, &quot;but nevertheless,</p>
<p>I shall risk it.  She had the plague, though, when she jumped</p>
<p>into the river, and perhaps the beat place to find her world be</p>
<p>the pest-house.  I shall try.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go, and Heaven speed you!  Yonder is the way to it, and my road</p>
<p>lies here.  Good night, master Hubert.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good night, Sir Norman,&quot; responded the page, bowing airily; &quot;and</p>
<p>if I do not find the lady to-night, most assuredly I shall do so</p>
<p>to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Turning along a road leading to the pest-house, and laughing as</p>
<p>he went, the boy disappeared.  Fearing lest the page should</p>
<p>follow him, and thereby discover a clue to Leoline&#x27;s abode, Sir</p>
<p>Norman turned into a street some distance from the house, and</p>
<p>waited in the shadow until he was out of sight.  Then he came</p>
<p>forth, and, full of impatience to get back to the ruin, hurried</p>
<p>on to where he had left his horse.  He was still in the care of</p>
<p>the watchman, whom he repaid for his trouble; and as he sprang on</p>
<p>his back, he glanced up at the windows of Leoline&#x27;s house.  It</p>
<p>was all buried in profound darkness but that one window from</p>
<p>which that faint light streamed, and he knew that she had not yet</p>
<p>gone to rest.  For a moment he lingered and looked at it in the</p>
<p>absurd way lovers will look, and was presently rewarded by seeing</p>
<p>what he watched for -</p>
<p>a shadow flit between him and the light.  The sight was a strong</p>
<p>temptation to him to dismount and enter, and, under pretence of</p>
<p>warning her against the Earl of Rochester and his &quot;pretty page,&quot;</p>
<p>see her once again.  But reflection, stepping rebukingly up to</p>
<p>him, whispered indignantly, that his ladylove was probably by</p>
<p>this time in her night robe, and not at home to lovers; and Sir</p>
<p>Norman respectfully bowed to reflection&#x27;s superior wisdom.  He</p>
<p>thought of Hubert&#x27;s words,&quot;If I do not find her tonight, I shall</p>
<p>most assuredly to-morrow,&quot; and a chill presentiment of coming</p>
<p>evil fell upon him.</p>
<p>&quot;To-morrow,&quot; he said, as he turned to go.  &quot;Who knows what</p>
<p>to-morrow may bring forth!  Fairest and dearest Leoline,</p>
<p>goodnight!&quot;</p>
<p>He rode away in the moonlight, with the stars shining peacefully</p>
<p>down upon him.  His heart at the moment was a divided one - one</p>
<p>half being given to Leoline, and the other to the Midnight Queen</p>
<p>and her mysterious court.  The farther he went away from Leoline,</p>
<p>the dimmer her star became in the horizon of his thoughts; and</p>
<p>the nearer he came to Miranda, the brighter and more eagerly she</p>
<p>loomed up, until he spurred his horse to a most furious gallop,</p>
<p>lest he should find the castle and the queen lost in the regions</p>
<p>of space when he got there.  Once the plague-stricken city lay</p>
<p>behind him, his journey was short; and soon, to his great</p>
<p>delight, he turned into the silent deserted by-path leading to</p>
<p>the ruin.</p>
<p>Tying his horse to a stake in the crumbling wall, he paused for a</p>
<p>moment to look at it in the pale, wan light of the midnight moon.</p>
<p>He had looked at it many a time before, but never with the same</p>
<p>interest as now; and the ruined battlements, the fallen roof, the</p>
<p>broken windows, and mouldering sides, had all a new and weird</p>
<p>interest for him.  No one was visible far or near; and feeling</p>
<p>that his horse was secure in the shadow of the wall, he entered,</p>
<p>and walked lightly and rapidly along in the direction of the</p>
<p>spiral staircase.  With more haste, but the same precaution, he</p>
<p>descended, and passed through the vaults to where he knew the</p>
<p>loose flag-stone was.  It was well he did know; for there was</p>
<p>neither strain of music nor ray of light to guide him now; and</p>
<p>his heart sank to zero as he thought he might raise the stone and</p>
<p>discover nothing.  His hand positively trembled with eagerness as</p>
<p>he lifted it; and with unbounded delight, not to be described,</p>
<p>looked down on the same titled assembly he had watched before.</p>
<p>But there had been a change since - half the lights were</p>
<p>extinguished, and the great vaulted room was comparatively in</p>
<p>shadow - the music had entirely died away  and all was solemnly</p>
<p>silent.  But what puzzled Sir Norman most of all was, the fact</p>
<p>that there seemed to be a trial of acme sort going on.</p>
<p>A long table, covered with green velvet, and looking not unlike a</p>
<p>modern billiard table, stood at the right of the queen&#x27;s crimson</p>
<p>throne; and behind it, perched in a high chair, and wearing a</p>
<p>long, solemn, black robe, sat a small, thick personage, whose</p>
<p>skin Sir Norman would have known on a bush.  He glanced at the</p>
<p>lower throne and found it as he expected, empty; and he saw at</p>
<p>once that his little highness was not only prince consort, but</p>
<p>also supreme judge in the kingdom.  Two or three similar</p>
<p>black-robed gentry, among whom was recognizable the noble duke</p>
<p>who so narrowly escaped with his life under the swords of Sir</p>
<p>Norman and Count L&#x27;Estrange.  Before this solemn conclave stood a</p>
<p>man who was evidently the prisoner under trial, and who wore the</p>
<p>whitest and most frightened face Sir Norman thought he had ever</p>
<p>beheld.  The queen was lounging negligently back on her throne,</p>
<p>paying very little attention to the solemn rites, occasionally</p>
<p>gossiping with some of the snow-white sylphs beside her, and</p>
<p>often yawning behind her pretty finger-tips, and evidently very</p>
<p>much bored by it all.</p>
<p>The rest of the company were decorously seated in the crimson and</p>
<p>gilded arm-chairs, some listening with interest to what was going</p>
<p>on, others holding whispered tete-a-tetes, and all very still and</p>
<p>respectful.</p>
<p>Sir Norman&#x27;s interest was aroused to the highest pitch; he</p>
<p>imprudently leaned forward too far, in order to bear and see, and</p>
<p>lost his balance.  He felt he was going, and tried to stop</p>
<p>himself, but in vain; and seeing there was no help for it, he</p>
<p>made a sudden spring, and landed right in the midst of the</p>
<p>assembly.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
<p>THE EXECUTION.</p>
<p>In an instant all was confusion.  Everybody sprang to their feet</p>
<ul>
<li>ladies shrieked in chorus, gentlemen swore and drew their</li>
</ul>
<p>swords, and looked to see if they might not expect a whole army</p>
<p>to drop from the sky upon them, as they stood.  No other</p>
<p>battalion, however, followed this forlorn hope; and seeing it,</p>
<p>the gentlemen took heart of grace and closed around the</p>
<p>unceremonious intruder.  The queen had sprung from her royal</p>
<p>seat, and stood with her bright lips parted, and her brighter</p>
<p>eyes dilating in speechless wonder.  The bench, with the judge at</p>
<p>their head, had followed her example, and stood staring with all</p>
<p>their might, looking, truth to tell, as much startled by the</p>
<p>sudden apparition as the fair sex.  The said fair sex were still</p>
<p>firing off little volleys of screams in chorus, and clinging</p>
<p>desperately to their cavaliers; and everything, in a word, was in</p>
<p>most admired disorder.</p>
<p>Tam O&#x27;Shanter&#x27;s cry, &quot;Weel done, Cutty sark!&quot; could not have</p>
<p>produced half such a commotion among his &quot;hellish legion&quot; as the</p>
<p>emphatic debut of Sir Norman Kingsley among these human revelers.</p>
<p>The only one who seemed rather to enjoy it than otherwise was the</p>
<p>prisoner, who was quietly and quickly making off, when the</p>
<p>malevolent and irrepressible dwarf espied him, and the one shock</p>
<p>acting as a counter-irritant to the other, he bounced fleetly</p>
<p>over the table, and grabbed him in his crab-like claws.</p>
<p>This brisk and laudable instance of self-command had a wonderful</p>
<p>and inspiriting effect on the rest; and as he replaced the pale</p>
<p>and palsied prisoner in his former position, giving him a</p>
<p>vindictive shake and vicious kick with his royal boots as he did</p>
<p>so, everybody began to feel themselves again.  The ladies stopped</p>
<p>screaming, the gentlemen ceased swearing, and more than one</p>
<p>exclamation of astonishment followed the cries of terror.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley!  Sir Norman Kingsley!&quot; rang from lip to lip</p>
<p>of those who recognized him; and all drew closer, and looked at</p>
<p>him as if they really could not make up their mind to believe</p>
<p>their eyes.  As for Sir Norman himself, that gentleman was</p>
<p>destined literally, if not metaphorically, to fall on his legs</p>
<p>that night, and had alighted on the crimson velvet-carpet,</p>
<p>cat-like, on his feet.  In reference to his feelings - his first</p>
<p>was one of frantic disapproval of going down; his second, one of</p>
<p>intense astonishment of finding himself there with unbroken</p>
<p>bones; his third, a disagreeable conviction that he had about put</p>
<p>his foot in it, and was in an excessively bad fix; and last, but</p>
<p>not least, a firm and rooted determination to make the beet of a</p>
<p>bad bargain, and never say die.</p>
<p>His first act was to take off his plumed hat, and make a profound</p>
<p>obeisance to her majesty the queen, who was altogether too much</p>
<p>surprised to make the return politeness demanded, and merely</p>
<p>stared at him with her great, beautiful, brilliant eyes, as if</p>
<p>she would never have done.</p>
<p>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen!&quot; said Sir Norman, turning gracefully to</p>
<p>the company; &quot;I beg ten thousand pardons for this unwarrantable</p>
<p>intrusion, and promise you, upon my honor, never to do it again.</p>
<p>I beg to assure you that my coming here was altogether</p>
<p>involuntary on my part, and forced by circumstances over which I</p>
<p>had no control; and I entreat you will not mind me in the least,</p>
<p>but go on with the proceeding, just as you did before.  Should</p>
<p>you feel my presence here any restraint, I am quite ready and</p>
<p>willing to take my departure at any moment; and as I before</p>
<p>insinuated, will promise, on the honor of a gentleman and a</p>
<p>knight, never again to take the liberty of tumbling through the</p>
<p>ceiling down on your heads.&quot;</p>
<p>This reference to the ceiling seemed to explain the whole</p>
<p>mystery; and everybody looked up at the corner whence he came</p>
<p>from, and saw the flag that had been removed.  As to his speech,</p>
<p>everybody had listened to it with the greatest of attention; and</p>
<p>sundry of the ladies, convinced by this time that he was flesh</p>
<p>and blood, and no ghost, favored the handsome young knight with</p>
<p>divers glances, not at all displeased or unadmiring.  The queen</p>
<p>sank back into her seat, keeping him still transfixed with her</p>
<p>darkly-splendid eyes; and whether she admired or otherwise, no</p>
<p>one could tell from her still, calm face.  The prince consort&#x27;s</p>
<p>feelings - for such there could be no doubt he was - were</p>
<p>involved in no such mystery; and he broke out into a hyena-like</p>
<p>scream of laughter, as he recognized, upon a second look, his</p>
<p>young friend of the Golden Crown.</p>
<p>&quot;So you have come, have you?&quot; he cried, thrusting his unlovely</p>
<p>visage over the table, till it almost touched sir Norman&#x27;s.  &quot;You</p>
<p>have come, have you, after all I said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, sir I have come!&quot; said Sir Norman, with a polite bow.</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps you don&#x27;t know me, my dear young sir - your little</p>
<p>friend, you know, of the Golden Crown.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I perfectly recognize you!  My little friend,&quot; said Sir</p>
<p>Norman, with bland suavity, and unconsciously quoting Leoline,</p>
<p>&quot;once seen in not easy to be-forgotten.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon this, his highness net up such another screech of mirth that</p>
<p>it quite woke an echo through the room; and all Sir Norman&#x27;s</p>
<p>friends looked grave; for when his highness laughed, it was a</p>
<p>very bad sign.</p>
<p>&quot;My little friend will hurt himself,&quot; remarked Sir Norman, with</p>
<p>an air of solicitude, &quot;if he indulges in his exuberant and</p>
<p>gleeful spirits to such an extent.  Let me recommend you, as a</p>
<p>well-wisher, to sit down and compose yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of complying, however, the prince, who seemed blessed</p>
<p>with a lively sense of the ludicrous, wan so struck with the</p>
<p>extreme funniness of the young man&#x27;s speech, that he relaxed into</p>
<p>another paroxysm of levity, shriller and more unearthly, if</p>
<p>possible, than any preceding one, and which left him so</p>
<p>exhausted, that he was forced to sink into his chair and into</p>
<p>silence through sheer fatigue.  Seizing this, the first</p>
<p>opportunity, Miranda, with a glance of displeased dignity st</p>
<p>Caliban, immediately struck in:</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you, sir, and by what right do you dare to come here?&quot;</p>
<p>Her tone was neither very sweet nor suave; but it was much</p>
<p>pleasanter to be cross-examined by the owner of such a pretty</p>
<p>face than by the ugly little monster, for the moment gasping and</p>
<p>extinguished; and Sir Norman turned to her with alacrity, and a</p>
<p>bow.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I am Sir Norman Kingsley, very much at your service; and</p>
<p>I beg to assure you I did not come here, but fell here, through</p>
<p>that hole, if you perceive, and very much against my will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Equivocation will not serve you in this case, sir,&quot; said the</p>
<p>queen, with an austere dignity.  &quot;And, allow me to observe, it is</p>
<p>just probable you would not have fallen through that hole in our</p>
<p>royal ceiling if you had kept away from it.  You raised that flag</p>
<p>yourself - did you not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madam, I fear I must say yes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And why did you do so?&quot; demanded her majesty, with far more</p>
<p>sharp asperity than Sir Norman dreamed could ever come from such</p>
<p>beautiful lips.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumor of Queen Miranda&#x27;s charms has gone forth; and I fear I</p>
<p>must own that rumor drew me hither,&quot; responded Sir Norman,</p>
<p>inventing a polite little work of fiction for the occasion; &quot;and,</p>
<p>let me add, that I came to find that rumor had under-rated</p>
<p>instead of exaggerated her majesty&#x27;s said charms.&quot;</p>
<p>Here Sir Norman, whose spine seemed in danger of becoming the</p>
<p>shape of a rainbow, in excess of good breeding, made another</p>
<p>genuflection before the queen, with his hand over the region of</p>
<p>his heart.  Miranda tried to look grave, and wear that expression</p>
<p>of severe solemnity I am told queens and rich people always do;</p>
<p>but, in spite of herself, a little pleased smile rippled over her</p>
<p>face; and, noticing it, and the bow and speech, the prince</p>
<p>suddenly and sharply set up such another screech of laughter as</p>
<p>no steamboat or locomotive, in the present age of steam, could</p>
<p>begin to equal in ghastliness.</p>
<p>&quot;Will your highness have the goodness to hold your tongue?&quot;</p>
<p>inquired the queen, with much the air and look of Mrs. Caudle,</p>
<p>&quot;and allow me to ask this stranger a few questions uninterrupted?</p>
<p>Sir Norman Kingsley, how long have you been above there,</p>
<p>listening and looking on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I was not there five minutes when I suddenly, and to my</p>
<p>great surprise, found myself here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A lie! - a lie!&quot; exclaimed the dwarf, furiously.  &quot;It is over</p>
<p>two hours since I met you at the bar of the Golden Crown.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear little friend,&quot; said Sir Norman, drawing his sword, and</p>
<p>flourishing it within an inch of the royal nose, &quot;just make that</p>
<p>remark again, and my sword will cleave your pretty head, as the</p>
<p>cimetar of Saladin clove the cushion of down!  I earnestly assure</p>
<p>you, madame, that I had but just knelt down to look, when I</p>
<p>discovered to my dismay, that I was no longer there, but in your</p>
<p>charming presence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In that case, my lords and gentlemen,&quot; said the queen, glancing</p>
<p>blandly round the apartment, &quot;he has witnessed nothing, and,</p>
<p>therefore, merits but slight punishment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Permit me, your majesty,&quot; said the duke, who had read the roll</p>
<p>of death, and who had been eyeing Sir Norman sharply for some</p>
<p>time, &quot;permit me one moment!  This is the very individual who</p>
<p>slew the Earl of Ashley, while his companion was doing for my</p>
<p>Lord Craven.  Sir Norman Kingsley,&quot; said his grace, turning, with</p>
<p>awful impressiveness to that young person, &quot;do you know me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite as well as I wish to,&quot; answered Sir Norman, with a cool</p>
<p>and rather contemptuous glance in his direction.  &quot;You look</p>
<p>extremely like a certain highwayman, with a most villainous</p>
<p>countenance, I encountered a few hours back, and whom I would</p>
<p>have made mince most of if he lead not been coward enough to fly.</p>
<p>Probably you may be the name; you look fit for that, or anything</p>
<p>else.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cut him down!&quot; &quot;Dash his brains out!&quot; &quot;Run him through!&quot; &quot;Shoot</p>
<p>him!&quot; were a few of the mild and pleasant insinuations that went</p>
<p>off on every side of him, like a fierce volley of pop-guns; and a</p>
<p>score of bright blades flashed blue and threatening on every</p>
<p>side; while the prince broke out into another shriek of laughter,</p>
<p>that rang high over all.</p>
<p>Sir Norman drew his own sword, and stood on the defence, breathed</p>
<p>one thought to Leoline, gave himself up for lost; but before</p>
<p>quite doing so - to use a phrase not altogether as original as it</p>
<p>might be - &quot;determined to sell his life as dearly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Angry eyes and fierce faces were on every hand, and his dreams of</p>
<p>matrimony and Leoline seemed about to terminate then and there,</p>
<p>when luck came to his side, in the shape of her most gracious</p>
<p>majesty the queen.  Springing to her feet, she waved her sceptre,</p>
<p>while her black eyes flashed as fiercely as the best of them, and</p>
<p>her voice rang out like a trumpet-tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Sheathe your swords, my lords, and back every man of you!  Not</p>
<p>one hair of his head shall fall without my permission; and the</p>
<p>first who lays hands on him until that consent is given, shall</p>
<p>die, if I have to shoot him myself!  Sir Norman Kingsley, stand</p>
<p>near, and fear not.  At his peril, let one of them touch you: &quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman bent on one knee, and raised the gracious hand to his</p>
<p>lips.  At the fierce, ringing, imperious tone, all involuntarily</p>
<p>fell back, as if they were accustomed to obey it; and the prince,</p>
<p>who seemed to-night in an uncommonly facetious mood, laughed</p>
<p>again, long and shrill.</p>
<p>&quot;What are your majesty&#x27;s commands?&quot; asked the discomfited duke,</p>
<p>rather sulkily.  &quot;Is this insulting interloper to go free?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is no affair of yours, my lord duke!&quot; answered the spirited</p>
<p>voice of the queen.  &quot;Be good enough to finish Lord Gloucester&#x27;s</p>
<p>trial; and until then I will be responsible for the safekeeping</p>
<p>of Sir Norman Kingsley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And after that, he is to go free eh, your majesty?&quot; said the</p>
<p>dwarf, laughing to that extent that he ran the risk of rupturing</p>
<p>an artery.</p>
<p>&quot;After that, it shall be precisely as I please!&quot; replied the</p>
<p>ringing voice; while the black eyes flashed anything but loving</p>
<p>glances upon him.  &quot;While I am queen here, I shall be obeyed;</p>
<p>when I am queen no longer, you may do as you please!  My lords&quot;</p>
<p>(turning her passionate, beautiful face to the hushed audience),</p>
<p>am I or am I not sovereign here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, you alone are our sovereign lady and queen!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, when I condescend to command, you shall obey!  Do you,</p>
<p>your highness, and you, lord duke, go on with the Earl of</p>
<p>Gloucester&#x27;s trial, and I will be the stranger&#x27;s jailer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is right,&quot; said the dwarf, his fierce little eyes gleaming</p>
<p>with a malignant light; &quot;let us do one thing before another; and</p>
<p>after we have settled Gloucester here, we will attend to this</p>
<p>man&#x27;s case.  Guards keep a sharp eye on your new prisoner.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, be good enough to resume your seats.  Now,</p>
<p>your grace, continue the trial.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did we leave off?&quot; inquired his grace, looking rather at a</p>
<p>loss, and scowling vengeance dire at the handsome queen and her</p>
<p>handsome protege, as he sank back in his chair of state.</p>
<p>&quot;The earl was confessing his guilt, or about to do so.  Pray, my</p>
<p>lord,&quot; said the dwarf, glaring upon the pallid prisoner, &quot;were</p>
<p>you not saying you had betrayed us to the king?&quot;</p>
<p>A breathless silence followed the question - everybody seemed to</p>
<p>hold his very breath to listen.  Even the queen leaned forward</p>
<p>and awaited the answer eagerly, and the many eyes that had been</p>
<p>riveted on Sir Norman since his entrance, left him now for the</p>
<p>first time and settled on the prisoner.  A piteous spectacle that</p>
<p>prisoner was - his face whiter than the snowy nymphs behind the</p>
<p>throne, and so distorted with fear, fury, and guilt, that it</p>
<p>looked scarcely human.  Twice he opened his eyes to reply, and</p>
<p>twice all sounds died away in a choking gasp.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you hear his highness?&quot; sharply inquired the lord high</p>
<p>chancellor, reaching over the great seal, and giving the unhappy</p>
<p>Earl of Gloucester a rap on the head with it, &quot;Why do you not</p>
<p>answer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon!  Pardon!&quot; exclaimed the earl, in a husky whisper.  &quot;Do</p>
<p>not believe the tales they tell you of me.  For Heaven&#x27;s sake,</p>
<p>spare my life!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Confess!&quot; thundered the dwarf, striking the table with his</p>
<p>clinched fist, until all the papers thereon jumped spasmodically</p>
<p>into the air-&quot;confess at once, or I shall run you through where</p>
<p>you stand!&quot;</p>
<p>The earl, with a perfect screech of terror, flung himself flat</p>
<p>upon his face and hands before the queen, with such force, that</p>
<p>Sir Norman expected to see his countenance make a hole in the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>&quot;O madame! spare me! spare me! spare me!  Have mercy on me as you</p>
<p>hope for mercy yourself!&quot;</p>
<p>She recoiled, and drew back her very garments from his touch, as</p>
<p>if that touch was pollution, eyeing him the while with a glance</p>
<p>frigid and pitiless as death.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no mercy for traitors!&quot; she coldly said.  &quot;Confess your</p>
<p>guilt, and expect no pardon from me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lift him up!&quot; shouted the dwarf, clawing the air with his hands,</p>
<p>as if he could have clawed the heart out of his victim&#x27;s body;</p>
<p>&quot;back with him to his place, guards, and see that he does not</p>
<p>leave it again!&quot;</p>
<p>Squirming, and writhing, and twisting himself in their grasp, in</p>
<p>very uncomfortable and eel-like fashion, the earl was dragged</p>
<p>back to his place, and forcibly held there by two of the guards,</p>
<p>while his face grew so ghastly and convulsed that Sir Norman</p>
<p>turned away his head, and could not bear to look at it.</p>
<p>&quot;Confess!&quot; once more yelled the dwarf in a terrible voice, while</p>
<p>his still more terrible eyes flashed sparks of fire - &quot;confess,</p>
<p>or by all that&#x27;s sacred it shall be tortured out of you.  Guards,</p>
<p>bring me the thumb-screws, and let us see if they will not</p>
<p>exercise the dumb devil by which our ghastly friend is</p>
<p>possessed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no!&quot; shrieked the earl, while the foam flew from his</p>
<p>lips.  &quot;I confess!  I confess!  I confess!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good!  And what do you confess?&quot; said the duke blandly, leaning</p>
<p>forward, while the dwarf fell back with a yell of laughter at the</p>
<p>success of his ruse.</p>
<p>&quot;I confess all - everything - anything! only spare my life!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you confess to having told Charles, King of England, the</p>
<p>secrets of our kingdom and this place?&quot; said the duke, sternly</p>
<p>rapping down the petition with a roll of parchment.</p>
<p>The earl grew, if possible, a more ghastly white.  &quot;I do - I</p>
<p>must! but oh! for the love of - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind love,&quot; cut in the inexorable duke, &quot;it is a subject</p>
<p>that has nothing whatever to do with the present case.  Did you</p>
<p>or did you not receive for the aforesaid information a large sum</p>
<p>of money?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did; but my lord, my lord, spare - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which sum of money you have concealed,&quot; continued the duke, with</p>
<p>another frown and a sharp rap.  &quot;Now the question is, where have</p>
<p>you concealed it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will tell you, with all my heart, only spare my life!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell us first, and we will think about your life afterward.  Let</p>
<p>me advise you as a friend, my lord, to tell at once, and</p>
<p>truthfully,&quot; said the duke, toying negligently with the</p>
<p>thumb-screws.</p>
<p>&quot;It is buried at the north corner of the old wall at the head of</p>
<p>Bradshaw&#x27;s grave.  You shall have that and a thousandfold more if</p>
<p>you&#x27;ll only pardon - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; broke in the dwarf, with the look and tone of an</p>
<p>exultant demon.  &quot;That is all we want!  My lord duke, give me the</p>
<p>death-warrant, and while her majesty signs it, I will pronounce</p>
<p>his doom!&quot;</p>
<p>The duke handed him a roll of parchment, which he glanced</p>
<p>critically over, and handed to the queen for her autograph.  That</p>
<p>royal lady spread the vellum on her knee, took the pen and</p>
<p>affixed her signature as coolly as if she were inditing a sonnet</p>
<p>in an album.  Then his highness, with a face that fairly</p>
<p>scintillated with demoniac delight, stood up and fixed his eyes</p>
<p>on the ghastly prisoner, and spoke in a voice that reverberated</p>
<p>like the tolling of a death-bell through the room.</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord of Gloucester, you have been tried by a council of your</p>
<p>fellow-peers, presided over by her royal self, and found guilty</p>
<p>of high treason.  Your sentence is that you be taken hence,</p>
<p>immediately, to the block, and there be beheaded, in punishment</p>
<p>of your crime.&quot;</p>
<p>His highness wound up this somewhat solemn speech, rather</p>
<p>inconsistently, bursting out into one of his shrillest peals of</p>
<p>laughter; and the miserable Earl of Gloucester, with a gasping,</p>
<p>unearthly cry, fell back in the arms of the attendants.  Dead and</p>
<p>oppressive silence reigned; and Sir Norman, who half believed all</p>
<p>along the whole thing was a farce, began to feel an uncomfortable</p>
<p>sense of chill creeping over him, and to think that, though</p>
<p>practical jokes were excellent things in their way, there was yet</p>
<p>a possibility of carrying them a little too far.  The</p>
<p>disagreeable silence was first broken by the dwarf, who, after</p>
<p>gloating for a moment over his victim&#x27;s convulsive spasms, sprang</p>
<p>nimbly from his chair of dignity and held out his arm for the</p>
<p>queen.  The queen arose, which seemed to be a sign for everybody</p>
<p>else to do the same, and all began forming themselves in a sort</p>
<p>of line of march.</p>
<p>&quot;Whist is to be done with this other prisoner, your highness?&quot;</p>
<p>inquired the duke, making a poke with his forefinger at Sir</p>
<p>Norman.  &quot;Is he to stay here, or is he to accompany us?&quot;</p>
<p>His highness turned round, and putting his face close up to Sir</p>
<p>Norman&#x27;s favored him with a malignant grin.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;d like to come, wouldn&#x27;t you, my dear young friend?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really,&quot; said Sir Norman, drawing back and returning the dwarf&#x27;s</p>
<p>stare with compound interest, &quot;that depends altogether on the</p>
<p>nature of the entertainment; but, at the same time, I&#x27;m much</p>
<p>obliged to you for consulting my inclinations.&quot;</p>
<p>This reply nearly overset his highness&#x27;s gravity once more, but</p>
<p>he checked his mirth after the first irresistible squeal; and</p>
<p>finding the company were all arranged in the order of going, and</p>
<p>awaiting his sovereign pleasure, he turned.</p>
<p>&quot;Let him come,&quot; he said, with his countenance still distorted by</p>
<p>inward merriment; &quot;It will do him good to see how we punish</p>
<p>offenders here, and teach him what he is to expect himself.  Is</p>
<p>your majesty ready?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My majesty has been ready and waiting for the last five</p>
<p>minutes,&quot; replied the lady, over-looking his proffered hand with</p>
<p>grand disdain, and stepping lightly down from her throne.</p>
<p>Her rising was the signal for the unseen band to strike up a</p>
<p>grand triumphant &quot;Io paean,&quot; though, had the &quot;Rogue&#x27;s March&quot; been</p>
<p>a popular melody in those times, it would have suited the</p>
<p>procession much more admirably.  The queen and the dwarf went</p>
<p>first, and a vivid contrast they were - she so young, so</p>
<p>beautiful, so proud, so disdainfully cold; he so ugly, so</p>
<p>stunted, so deformed, so fiendish.  After them went the band of</p>
<p>sylphs in white, then the chancellor, archbishop, and</p>
<p>embassadors; next the whole court of ladies and gentlemen; and</p>
<p>after them Sir Norman, in the custody of two of the soldiers.</p>
<p>The condemned earl came last, or rather allowed himself to be</p>
<p>dragged by his four guards; for he seemed to have become</p>
<p>perfectly palsied and dumb with fear.  Keeping time to the</p>
<p>triumphant march, and preserving dismal silence, the procession</p>
<p>wound its way along the room and through a great archway</p>
<p>heretofore hidden by the tapestry now lifted lightly by the</p>
<p>nymphs.  A long stone passage, carpeted with crimson and gold,</p>
<p>and brilliantly illuminated like the grand saloon they had left,</p>
<p>was thus revealed, and three similar archways appeared at the</p>
<p>extremity, one to the right and left, and one directly before</p>
<p>them.  The procession passed through the one to the left, and Sir</p>
<p>Norman started in dismay to find himself in the most gloomy</p>
<p>apartment he had ever beheld in his life.  It was all covered</p>
<p>with black - walls, ceiling, and floor were draped in black, and</p>
<p>reminded him forcibly of La Masque&#x27;s chamber of horrors, only</p>
<p>this was more repellant.  It was lighted, or rather the gloom was</p>
<p>troubled, by a few spectral tapers of black wax in ebony</p>
<p>candlesticks, that seemed absolutely to turn black, and make the</p>
<p>horrible place more horrible.  There was no furniture - neither</p>
<p>couch, chair, nor table nothing but a sort of stage at the upper</p>
<p>end of the room, with something that looked like a seat upon it,</p>
<p>and both were shrouded with the same dismal drapery.  But it was</p>
<p>no seat; for everybody stood, arranging themselves silently and</p>
<p>noiselessly around the walls, with the queen and the dwarf at</p>
<p>their head, and near this elevation stood a tall, black statue,</p>
<p>wearing a mask, and leaning on a bright, dreadful, glittering</p>
<p>axe.  The music changed to an unearthly dirge, so weird and</p>
<p>blood-curdling, that Sir Norman could have put his hands over his</p>
<p>ear-drums to shut out the ghastly sound.  The dismal room, the</p>
<p>voiceless spectators, tho black spectre with the glittering axe,</p>
<p>the fearful music, struck a chill to his inmost heart.</p>
<p>Could it be possible they were really going to murder the unhappy</p>
<p>wretch?  and could all those beautiful ladies--could that</p>
<p>surpassingly beautiful queen, stand there serenely unmoved, to</p>
<p>witness such a crime?  While he yet looked round in horror, the</p>
<p>doomed man, already apparently almost dead with fear, was dragged</p>
<p>forward by his guards.  Paralyzed as he was, at sight of the</p>
<p>stage which he knew to be the scaffold, he uttered shriek after</p>
<p>shriek of frenzied despair, and struggled like a madman to get</p>
<p>free.  But as well might Laocoon have struggled in the folds of</p>
<p>the serpent; they pulled him on, bound him hand and foot, and</p>
<p>held his head forcibly down on the block.</p>
<p>The black spectre moved - the dwarf made a signal - the</p>
<p>glittering axe was raised - fell - a scream was cut in two - a</p>
<p>bright jet of blood spouted up in the soldiers faces, blinding</p>
<p>them; the axe fell again, and the Earl of Gloucester was minus</p>
<p>that useful and ornamental appendage, a head.</p>
<p>It was all over so quickly, that Sir Norman could scarcely</p>
<p>believe his horrified senses, until the deed was done.  The</p>
<p>executioner threw a black cloth over the bleeding trunk, and held</p>
<p>up the grizzly head by the hair; and Sir Norman could have sworn</p>
<p>the features moved, and the dead eyes rolled round the room.</p>
<p>&quot;Behold!&quot; cried the executioner, striking the convulsed face with</p>
<p>the palm of his open hand, &quot;the fate of all traitors!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And of all spies!&quot; exclaimed the dwarf, glaring with his</p>
<p>fiendish eyes upon the appalled Sir Norman.  &quot;Keep your axe sharp</p>
<p>and bright, Mr. Executioner, for before morning dawns there is</p>
<p>another gentleman here to be made shorter by a head.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>
<p>DOOM.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us go,&quot; said the queen, glancing at the revolting sight, and</p>
<p>turning away with a shudder of repulsion.  &quot;Faugh! The sight of</p>
<p>blood has made me sick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And taken away my appetite for supper,&quot; added a youthful and</p>
<p>elegant beauty beside her.  &quot;My Lord Gloucester was hideous</p>
<p>enough when living, but, mon Dieu,! he is ten times more so when</p>
<p>dead!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your ladyship will not have the same story to tell of yonder</p>
<p>stranger, when he shares the same fate in are hour or two!&quot; said</p>
<p>the dwarf, with a malicious grin; &quot;for I heard you remarking upon</p>
<p>his extreme beauty when he first appeared.&quot;</p>
<p>The lady laughed and bowed, and turned her bright eyes upon Sir</p>
<p>Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;True!  It is almost a pity to cut such a handsome head off - is</p>
<p>it not?  I wish I had a voice in your highness&#x27;s council, and I</p>
<p>know what I should do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, Lady Mountjoy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Entreat him to swear fealty, and become one of as; and - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And a bridegroom for your ladyship?&quot; suggested the queen, with a</p>
<p>curling lip.  &quot;I think if Sir Norman Kingsley knew Lady Mountjoy</p>
<p>as well as I do, he would even prefer the block to such a fate!&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Mountjoy&#x27;s brilliant eyes shone like two angry meteors; but</p>
<p>she merely bowed and laughed; and the laugh was echoed by the</p>
<p>dwarf in his shrillest falsetto.</p>
<p>&quot;Does your highness intend remaining here all night?&quot; demanded</p>
<p>the queen, rather fiercely.  &quot;If not, the sooner we leave this</p>
<p>ghastly place the better.  The play is over, and supper is</p>
<p>waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>With which the royal virago made an imperious motion for her</p>
<p>attendant sprites in gossamer white to precede her, and turned</p>
<p>with her accustomed stately step to follow.  The music</p>
<p>immediately changed from its doleful dirge to a spirited measure,</p>
<p>and the whole company flocked after her, back to the great room</p>
<p>of state.  There they all paused, hovering in uncertainty around</p>
<p>the room, while the queen, holding her purple train up lightly in</p>
<p>one hand, stood at the foot of the throne, glancing at them with</p>
<p>her cold, haughty and beautiful eyes.  In their wandering, those</p>
<p>same darkly-splendid eyes glanced and lighted on Sir Norman, who,</p>
<p>in a state of seeming stupor at the horrible scene he had just</p>
<p>witnessed, stood near the green table, and they sent a thrill</p>
<p>through him with their wonderful resemblance to Leoline&#x27;s.  So</p>
<p>vividly alike were they, that he half doubted for a moment</p>
<p>whether she and Leoline were not really one; but no - Leoline</p>
<p>never could have had the cold, cruel heart to stand and witness</p>
<p>such a horrible eight.  Miranda&#x27;s dark, piercing glance fell as</p>
<p>haughtily and disdainfully on him as it had on the rest; and his</p>
<p>heart sank as he thought that whatever sympathy she had felt for</p>
<p>him was entirely gone.  It might have been a whim, a woman&#x27;s</p>
<p>caprice, a spirit of contradiction, that had induced her to</p>
<p>defend him at first.  Whatever it was, and it mattered not now,</p>
<p>it had completely vanished.  No face of marble could have been</p>
<p>colder, of stonier, or harder, than hers, as she looked at him</p>
<p>out of the depths of her great dark eyes; and with that look, his</p>
<p>last lingering hope of life vanished.</p>
<p>&quot;And now for the next trial!&quot; exclaimed the dwarf, briskly</p>
<p>breaking in upon his drab-colored meditations, and bustling past.</p>
<p>&quot;We will get it over at once, and have done with it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will do no such thing!&quot; said the imperious voice of the</p>
<p>queenly shrew.  &quot;We will have neither trials nor anything else</p>
<p>until after supper, which has already been delayed four full</p>
<p>minutes.  My lord chamberlain, have the goodness to step in and</p>
<p>see that all is in order.&quot;</p>
<p>One of the gilded and decorated gentlemen whom sir Norman had</p>
<p>mistaken for ambassadors stepped off, in obedience, through</p>
<p>another opening in the tapestry - which seemed to be as</p>
<p>extensively undermined with such apertures as a cabman&#x27;s coat</p>
<p>with capes - and, while he was gone, the queen stood drawn up to</p>
<p>her full height, with her scornful face looking down on the</p>
<p>dwarf.  That small man knit up his very plain face into a bristle</p>
<p>of the sourest kinks, and frowned sulky disapproval at an order</p>
<p>which he either would not, or dared not, countermand.  Probably</p>
<p>the latter had most to do with it, as everybody looked hungry and</p>
<p>mutinous, and a great deal more eager for their supper than the</p>
<p>life of Sir Norman Kingsley.</p>
<p>&quot;Your majesty, the royal banquet is waiting,&quot; insinuated the lord</p>
<p>high chamberlain, returning, and bending over until his face and</p>
<p>his shoe buckles almost touched.</p>
<p>&quot;And what is to be done with this prisoner, while we are eating</p>
<p>it?&quot; growled the dwarf, looking drawn swords at his liege lady.</p>
<p>&quot;He can remain here under care of the guards, can he not?&quot; she</p>
<p>retorted sharply.  &quot;Or, if you are afraid they are not equal to</p>
<p>taking care of him, you had better stay and watch him yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>With which answer, her majesty sailed majestically away, leaving</p>
<p>the gentleman addressed to follow or not, as he pleased.  It</p>
<p>pleased him to do so, on the whole; and he went after her,</p>
<p>growling anathemas between his royal teeth, and evidently in the</p>
<p>same state of mind that induces gentlemen in private life to take</p>
<p>sticks to their aggravating spouses, under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>However, it might not be just the thing, perhaps, for kings and</p>
<p>queens to take broom-sticks to settle their little differences of</p>
<p>opinion, like common Christians; and so the prince peaceably</p>
<p>followed her, and entered the salle a manger with the rest, and</p>
<p>Sir Norman and his keepers were left in the hall of state,</p>
<p>monarchs of all they surveyed.  Notwithstanding he knew his hours</p>
<p>were numbered, the young knight could not avoid feeling curious,</p>
<p>and the tapestry having been drawn aside, he looked through the</p>
<p>arch with a good deal of interest.</p>
<p>The apartment was smaller than the one in which he stood - though</p>
<p>still very large, and instead of being all crimson and gold, was</p>
<p>glancing and glittering with blue and silver.  These azure</p>
<p>hangings were of satin, instead of velvet, and looked quite light</p>
<p>and cool, compared to the hot, glowing place where he was.  The</p>
<p>ceiling was spangled over with silver stars, with the royal arms</p>
<p>quartered in the middle, and the chairs were of white, polished</p>
<p>wood, gleaming like ivory, and cushioned with blue satin.  The</p>
<p>table was of immense length, as it had need to be, and flashed</p>
<p>and sparkled in the wax lights with heaps of gold and silver</p>
<p>plate, cut-glass, and precious porcelain.  Golden and crimson</p>
<p>wines shone in the carved decanters; great silver baskets of</p>
<p>fruit were strewn about, with piles of cakes and confectionery -</p>
<p>not to speak of more solid substantials, wherein the heart of</p>
<p>every true Englishman delighteth.  The queen sat in a great,</p>
<p>raised chair at the head, and helped herself without paying much</p>
<p>attention to anybody, and &quot;the remainder were ranged down its</p>
<p>length, according to their rank - which, as they were all pretty</p>
<p>much dukes and duchesses, was about equal.</p>
<p>The spirits of the company - depressed for a moment by the</p>
<p>unpleasant little circumstance of seeing one of their number</p>
<p>beheaded - seemed to revive under the spirituous influence of</p>
<p>sherry, sack, and burgundy; and soon they were laughing, and</p>
<p>chatting, and hobnobbing, as animatedly as any dinner-party Sir</p>
<p>Norman had ever seen.  The musicians, too, appeared to be in high</p>
<p>feather, and the merriest music of the day assisted the noble</p>
<p>banqueters&#x27; digestion.</p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances, it war rather a tantalizing scene</p>
<p>to stand aloof and contemplate; and so the guards very likely</p>
<p>felt; but Sir Norman&#x27;s thoughts were of that room in black, the</p>
<p>headsman&#x27;s axe, and Leoline.  He felt he would never see her</p>
<p>again - never see the sun rise that was to shine on their bridal;</p>
<p>and he wondered what she would think of him, and if she was</p>
<p>destined to fall into the hands of Lord Rochester or Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange.  As a general thing, our young friend was not given</p>
<p>to melancholy moralizing, but in the present case, with the</p>
<p>headsman&#x27;s axe poised like the sword of Damocles above him by a</p>
<p>single hair, he may be pardoned for reflecting that this world is</p>
<p>all a fleeting show, and that he had got himself into a scrape,</p>
<p>to which the plague was a trifle.  And yet, with nervous</p>
<p>impatience, he wished the dinner and his trial were over, his</p>
<p>fate sealed, and his life ended at once, since it was to be ended</p>
<p>soon.  For the fulfillment of the first wish, he had not long to</p>
<p>wait; the feast, though gay and grand, was of the briefest, and</p>
<p>they could have scarcely been half an hour gone when they were</p>
<p>all back.</p>
<p>Everybody seemed in better humor, too, after the refection, but</p>
<p>the queen and the dwarf - the former looked colder, and harder,</p>
<p>and more like a Labrador iceberg tricked out in purple velvet,</p>
<p>than ever, and his highness was grinning from ear to ear - which</p>
<p>was the very worst possible sign.  Not even her majesty could</p>
<p>make the slightest excuse for delaying the trial now; and,</p>
<p>indeed, that eccentric lady seemed to have no wish to do so, had</p>
<p>she the power, but seated herself in silent disdain of them all,</p>
<p>and dropping her long lashes over her dark eyes, seemed to forget</p>
<p>there was anybody in existence but herself.</p>
<p>His highness and his nobles took their stations of authority</p>
<p>behind the green table, and summoned the guards to lead the</p>
<p>prisoner up before them, which was done; while the rest of the</p>
<p>company were fluttering down into their seats, and evidently</p>
<p>about to pay the greatest attention.  The cases in this midnight</p>
<p>court seemed to be conducted on a decidedly original plan, and</p>
<p>with an easy rapidity that would have electrified any other</p>
<p>court, ancient or modern.  Sir Norman took his stand, and eyed</p>
<p>his judges with a look half contemptuous, half defiant; and the</p>
<p>proceedings commenced by the dwarf a leaning forward and breaking</p>
<p>into a roar of laughter, right in his face.</p>
<p>&quot;My little friend I warned you before not to be so facetious,&quot;</p>
<p>said Sir Norman, regarding him quietly; &quot;a rush of mirth to the</p>
<p>brain will certainly be the death of you one of these day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No levity, young man!&quot; interposed the lord chancellor,</p>
<p>rebukingly; &quot;remember, you are addressing His Royal Highness</p>
<p>Prince Caliban, Spouse, and Consort of Her Most Gracious Majesty,</p>
<p>Miranda!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed!  Then all I have to say, is, that her majesty has very</p>
<p>bad taste in the selection of a husband, unless, indeed, her wish</p>
<p>was to marry the ugliest man in the world, as she herself is the</p>
<p>most beautiful of women!&quot;</p>
<p>Her majesty took not the slightest notice of this compliment, not</p>
<p>so much as a flatter of her drooping eye-lashes betrayed that she</p>
<p>even heard it, but his highness laughed until he was perfectly</p>
<p>hoarse.</p>
<p>&quot;Silence!&quot; shouted the duke, shocked and indignant at this</p>
<p>glaring disrespect, &quot;and answer truthfully the questions put to</p>
<p>you.  Your name, you say, is Sir Norman Kingsley?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.  Has your grace any objection to it?&quot;</p>
<p>His grace waved down the interruption with a dignified wave of</p>
<p>the hand, and went on with were judicial dignity.</p>
<p>&quot;You are the same who shot Lord Ashley between this and the city,</p>
<p>some hours ago?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I had the pleasure of shooting a highwayman there, and my only</p>
<p>regret is, I did not perform the same good office by his</p>
<p>companion, in the person of your noble self, before you turned</p>
<p>and fled.&quot;</p>
<p>A slight titter ran round the room, and the duke turned crimson.</p>
<p>&quot;These remarks are impertinent, and not to the purpose.  You are</p>
<p>the murderer of Lord Ashley, let that suffice.  Probably you were</p>
<p>on your way hither when you did the deed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was,&quot; said the dwarf, vindictively.  &quot;I met him at the Golden</p>
<p>Crown but a short time after.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well, that is another point settled, and either of them is</p>
<p>strong enough to seal his death warrant.  You came here as a spy,</p>
<p>to see and hear and report - probably you were sent by King</p>
<p>Charles?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably - just think as you please about it!&quot; said Sir Norman,</p>
<p>who knew his case was as desperate as it could be, and was quite</p>
<p>reckless what he answered.</p>
<p>&quot;You admit that you are a spy, then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No such thing.  I have owned nothing.  As I told you before, you</p>
<p>are welcome to put what construction you please on my actions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley, this is nonsensical equivocation!  You own</p>
<p>you came to hear and see?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, hearing and seeing constitute spying, do they not?</p>
<p>Therefore, you are a spy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I confess it looks like it.  What next?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Need you ask   What is the fate of all spies?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No matter what they are in other places, I am pretty certain</p>
<p>what they are here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A room in black, and a chop with an axe  -the Earl of</p>
<p>Gloucester&#x27;s fate, in a word!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have said it!  Have you any reason why such a sentence</p>
<p>should not be pronounced on you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None; pronounce it as soon as you like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With the greatest pleasure!&quot; said the duke, who had been</p>
<p>scrawling on another ominous roll of vellum, and now passed it to</p>
<p>the dwarf.  &quot;I never knew anyone it gave me more delight to</p>
<p>condemn.  Will your highness pass that to her majesty for</p>
<p>signature, and pronounce his sentence.&quot;</p>
<p>His highness, with a grin of most exquisite delight, did as</p>
<p>directed; and Sir Norman looked steadfastly at the queen as she</p>
<p>received it.  One of the gauzy nymphs presented it to her,</p>
<p>kneeling, and she took it with a look half bored, half impatient,</p>
<p>and lightly scrawled her autograph.  The long, dark lashes did</p>
<p>not lift; no change passed over the calm, cold face, as icily</p>
<p>placid as a frozen lake in the moonlight - evidently the life or</p>
<p>death of the stranger was less than nothing to her.  To him she,</p>
<p>too, was as nothing, or nearly so; but yet there was a sharp</p>
<p>jarring pain at his heart, as he saw that fair hand, that had</p>
<p>saved him once, so coolly sign his death warrant now.  But there</p>
<p>was little time left for to watch her; for, as she pushed it</p>
<p>impatiently away, and relapsed into her former proud</p>
<p>listlessness, the dwarf got up with one of his death&#x27;s-head</p>
<p>grins, and began:</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley, you have been tried and convicted as a spy,</p>
<p>and the paid-hireling of the vindictive and narrow-minded</p>
<p>Charles; and the sentence of this court, over which I have the</p>
<p>honor to preside, is, that you be taken hence immediately to the</p>
<p>place of execution, and there lose your head by the axe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And a mighty small loss it will be!&quot; remarked the duke to</p>
<p>himself, in a sort of parenthesis, as the dwarf concluded his</p>
<p>pleasant observation by thrusting himself forward across the</p>
<p>table, after his rather discomposing fashion, and breaking out</p>
<p>into one of has diabolical laughter-chips.</p>
<p>The queen, who had been sitting passive, and looking as if she</p>
<p>were in spirit a thousand miles away, now started up with sharp</p>
<p>suddenness, and favored his highness with one of her fieriest</p>
<p>fiery glances.</p>
<p>&quot;Will your highness just permit somebody else to have a voice in</p>
<p>that matter?  How many more trials are to come on tonight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only one,&quot; replied the duke, glancing over a little roll which</p>
<p>he held; &quot;Lady Castlemaine&#x27;s, for poisoning the Duchess of</p>
<p>Sutherland.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is my Lady Castlemaine&#x27;s fate to be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The same as our friend&#x27;s here, in all probability,&quot; nodding</p>
<p>easily, not to say playfully, at Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;And how long will her trial last?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Half an hour, or thereabouts.  There are some secrets in the</p>
<p>matter that have to be investigated, and which will require some</p>
<p>time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then let all the trials be over first, and all the beheadings</p>
<p>take place together.  We don&#x27;t choose to take the trouble of</p>
<p>traveling to the Black Chamber just to see his head chopped off,</p>
<p>and then have the same journey to undergo half an hour after, for</p>
<p>a similar purpose.  Call Lady Castlemaine, and let this prisoner</p>
<p>be taken to one of the dungeons, and there remain until the time</p>
<p>for execution.  Guards, do you hear?  Take him away!&quot;</p>
<p>The dwarf&#x27;s face grew black as a thunder-cloud, and he jumped to</p>
<p>his feet and confronted the queen with a look so intensely ugly</p>
<p>that no other earthly face could have assumed it.  But that lady</p>
<p>merely met it with one of cold disdain and aversion, and, keeping</p>
<p>her dark bright eyes fixed chillingly upon him, waved her white</p>
<p>hand, in her imperious way, to the guards.  Those warlike</p>
<p>gentlemen knew better than to disobey her most gracious majesty</p>
<p>when she happened to be, like Mrs. Joe Gargary, on the &quot;rampage,&quot;</p>
<p>which, if her flashing eye and a certain expression about her</p>
<p>handsome mouth spoke the truth, must have been twenty hours out</p>
<p>of the twenty-four.  As the soldiers approached to lead him away,</p>
<p>Sir Norman tried to catch her eye; but in vain, for she kept</p>
<p>those brilliant optics most unwinkingly fixed on the dwarf&#x27;s</p>
<p>face.</p>
<p>&quot;Call Lady Castlemaine,&quot; commanded the duke, as Sir Norman with</p>
<p>his guards passed through the doorway leading to the Black</p>
<p>Chamber.  &quot;Your highness, I presume, is ready to attend to her</p>
<p>case.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Before I attend to hers or any one else&#x27;s case,&quot; said the dwarf,</p>
<p>hopping over the table like an overgrown toad, &quot;I will first see</p>
<p>that this guest of ours is properly taken care, of, and does not</p>
<p>leave us without the ceremony of saying good-bye.&quot;</p>
<p>With which, he seized one of the wax candles, and trotted, with</p>
<p>rather unprincely haste, after Sir Norman and his conductors.</p>
<p>The young knight had been led down the same long passage he had</p>
<p>walked through before; but instead of entering the chamber of</p>
<p>horrors, they passed through the centre arch, and found</p>
<p>themselves in another long, vaulted corridor, dimly lit by the</p>
<p>glow of the outer one.  It was as cold and dismal a place, Sir</p>
<p>Norman thought, as he had ever seen; and it had an odor damp and</p>
<p>earthy, and of the grave.  It had two or three great, ponderous</p>
<p>doors on either aide, fastened with huge iron bolts; and before</p>
<p>one of these his conductors paused.  Just as they did so, the</p>
<p>glimmer of the dwarf&#x27;s taper pierced the gloom, and the next</p>
<p>moment, smiling from ear to ear, he was by their side.</p>
<p>&quot;Down with the bars!&quot; he cried.  &quot;This is the one for him - the</p>
<p>strongest and safest of them all.  Now, my dashing courtier, you</p>
<p>will see how tenderly your little friend provides for his</p>
<p>favorites!&quot;</p>
<p>If Sir Norman made any reply, it was drowned id the rattle and</p>
<p>clank of the massive bars, and is hopelessly lost to posterity.</p>
<p>The huge door swung back; but nothing was visible but a sort of</p>
<p>black velvet pall, and effluvia much stronger than sweet.</p>
<p>Involuntarily he recoiled as one of the guards made a motion for</p>
<p>him to enter.</p>
<p>&quot;I Shove him in! shove him in!&quot; shrieked the dwarf, who was</p>
<p>getting so excited with glee that he was dancing about in a sort</p>
<p>of jig of delight.  &quot;In with him - in with him!  If he won&#x27;t go</p>
<p>peaceably, kick him in head-foremost!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would strongly advise them not to try it,&quot; said Sir Norman, as</p>
<p>he stepped into the blackness, &quot;if they have any regard for their</p>
<p>health!  It does not make much difference after all, my little</p>
<p>friend, whether I spend the next half-hour in the inky blackness</p>
<p>of this place or the blood-red grandeur of your royal court.  My</p>
<p>little friend, until we meet again, permit me to say, au revoir.&quot;</p>
<p>The dwarf laughed in his pleasant way, and pushed the candle</p>
<p>cautiously inside the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Good-by for a little while, my dear young sir, and while the</p>
<p>headsmen is sharpening his axe, I&#x27;ll leave you to think about</p>
<p>your little friend.  Lest you should lack amusement, I&#x27;ll leave</p>
<p>you a light to contemplate your apartment; and for fear you may</p>
<p>get lonesome, these two gentlemen will stand outside your door,</p>
<p>with their swords drawn, till I come back.  Good-by, my dear</p>
<p>,young sir - good-bye!&quot;</p>
<p>The dungeon-door swung to with a tremendous bang Sir Norman was</p>
<p>barred in his prison to await his doom and the dwarf was skipping</p>
<p>along the passage with sprightliness, laughing as he went.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>
<p>ESCAPED.</p>
<p>Probably not one of you; my dear friends, who glance graciously</p>
<p>over this, was ever shut up in a dungeon under expectation of</p>
<p>bearing the unpleasant operation of decapitation within half an</p>
<p>hour.  It never happened to myself, either, that I can recollect;</p>
<p>so, of course, you or I personally can form no idea what the</p>
<p>sensation may be like; but in this particular case, tradition</p>
<p>saith Sir Norman Kingsley&#x27;s state of mind was decidedly</p>
<p>depressed.  As the door shut violently, he leaned against it, and</p>
<p>listened to his jailers place the great bars into their sockets,</p>
<p>and felt he was shut in, in the dreariest, darkest, dismalest,</p>
<p>disagreeablest place that it had ever been his misfortune to</p>
<p>enter.  He thought of Leoline, and reflected that in all</p>
<p>probability she was sleeping the sleep of the just - perhaps</p>
<p>dreaming of him, and little knowing that his head was to be cut</p>
<p>off in half an hour.</p>
<p>In course of time morning would come - it was not likely the</p>
<p>ordinary course of nature would be cut off because he was; and</p>
<p>Leoline would get up and dress herself, and looking a thousand</p>
<p>times prettier than ever, stand at the window and wait for him.</p>
<p>Ah! she might wait - much good would it do her; about that time</p>
<p>he would probably be - where?  It was a rather uncomfortable</p>
<p>question, but easily answered, and depressed him to a very</p>
<p>desponding degree indeed.</p>
<p>He thought of Ormiston and La Masque - no doubt they were billing</p>
<p>and cooing in most approved fashion just then, and never thinking</p>
<p>of him; though, but for La Masque and his own folly, he might</p>
<p>have been half married by this time.  He thought of Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange and Master Hubert, and become firmly convinced, if one</p>
<p>did not find Leoline the other would; and each being equally bad,</p>
<p>it was about a toss up in agony which got her.</p>
<p>He thought of Queen Miranda, and of the adage, &quot;put no trust in</p>
<p>princes,&quot; and sighed deeply as he reflected what a bad sign of</p>
<p>human nature it was - more particularly such handsome human</p>
<p>nature - that she could, figuratively speaking, pat him on the</p>
<p>back one moment, and kick him to the scaffold the next.  He</p>
<p>thought, dejectedly, what a fool he was ever to have come back;</p>
<p>or even having come back, not to have taken greater pains to stay</p>
<p>up aloft, instead of pitching abruptly head-foremost into such a</p>
<p>select company without an invitation.  He thought, too, what a</p>
<p>cold, damp, unwholesome chamber they had lodged him in, and how</p>
<p>apt he would be to have a bad attack of ague and miasmatic fever,</p>
<p>if they would only let him live long enough to enjoy those</p>
<p>blessings.  And this having brought him to the end of his</p>
<p>melancholy meditation, he began to reflect how he could best</p>
<p>amuse himself in the interim, before quitting this vale of tears.</p>
<p>The candle was still blinking feebly on the floor, shedding tears</p>
<p>of wax in its feeble prostration, and it suddenly reminded him of</p>
<p>the dwarf&#x27;s advice to examine his dark bower of repose.  So be</p>
<p>picked it up and snuffed it with his fingers, and held it aloof,</p>
<p>much as Robinson Crusoe held the brand in the dark cavern with</p>
<p>the dead goat.</p>
<p>In the velvet pall of blackness before alluded to, its small, wan</p>
<p>ray pierced but a few inches, and only made the darkness visible.</p>
<p>But Sir Norman groped his way to the wall, which he found to be</p>
<p>all over green and noisome slime, and broken out into a cold,</p>
<p>clammy perspiration, as though it were at its last gasp.  By the</p>
<p>aid of his friendly light, for which he was really much obliged -</p>
<p>a fact which, had his little friend known, he would not have left</p>
<p>it - he managed to make the circuit of his prison, which he found</p>
<p>rather spacious, and by no means uninhabited; for the walls and</p>
<p>floor were covered with fat, black beetles, whole families of</p>
<p>which interesting specimens of the insect-world he crunched</p>
<p>remorselessly under foot, and massacred at every step; and great,</p>
<p>depraved-looking rats, with flashing eyes and sinister-teeth, who</p>
<p>made frantic dives and rushes at him, and bit at his jack-boots</p>
<p>with fierce, fury.  These small quadrupeds reminded him forcibly</p>
<p>of the dwarf, especially in the region of the eyes and the</p>
<p>general expression of countenance; and he began to reflect that</p>
<p>if the dwarf&#x27;s soul (supposing him to possess such an article as</p>
<p>that, which seemed open to debate) passed after death into the</p>
<p>body of any other animal, it would certainly be into that of a</p>
<p>rat.</p>
<p>He had just come to this conclusion, and was applying the flame</p>
<p>of the candle to the nose of an inquisitive beetle, when it</p>
<p>struck him he heard voices in altercation outside his door.  One,</p>
<p>clear, ringing, and imperious, yet withal feminine, was certainly</p>
<p>not heard for the first time; and the subdued and respectful</p>
<p>voices that answered, were those of his guards.</p>
<p>After a moment, he heard the sound of the withdrawing bolts, and</p>
<p>his heart beat fast.  Surely, his half-hour had not already</p>
<p>expired; and if it had, would she be the person to conduct him to</p>
<p>death?  The door opened; a puff of wind extinguished his candle,</p>
<p>but not until he had caught the glimmer of jewels, the shining of</p>
<p>gold, and the flutter of long, black hair; and then some one came</p>
<p>in.  The door was closed; the bolts shot back! - and he was alone</p>
<p>with Miranda, the queen.</p>
<p>There was no trouble about recognising her, for she carried in</p>
<p>her hand a small lamp, which she held up between them, that its</p>
<p>rays might fall directly on both faces.  Each was rather white,</p>
<p>perhaps, and one heart was going faster than it had ever gone</p>
<p>before, and that one was decidedly not the queen&#x27;s.  She was</p>
<p>dressed exactly as he had seen her, in purple and ermine, in</p>
<p>jewels and gold; and strangely out of place she looked there, in</p>
<p>her splendid dress and splendid beauty, among the black beetles</p>
<p>and rats.  Her face might have been a dead, blank wall, or cut</p>
<p>out of cold, white stone, for all it expressed; and as she</p>
<p>lightly held up her rich robes in one hand, and in the other bore</p>
<p>the light, the dark, shining eyes were fixed on his face, and</p>
<p>were as barren of interest, eagerness, compassion, tenderness, or</p>
<p>any other feeling, as the shining, black glass ones of a wax</p>
<p>doll.  So they stood looking at each other for some ten seconds</p>
<p>or so, and then, still looking full at him, Miranda spoke, and</p>
<p>her voice was as clear and emotionless as her eyes</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Sir Norman Kingsley, I have come to see you before you</p>
<p>die.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame,&quot; he stammered, scarcely knowing what he said, &quot;you are</p>
<p>kind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I?  Perhaps you forget I signed your death-warrant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably it would have been at the risk of your own life to</p>
<p>refuse?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of the kind!  Not one of them would hurt a hair of my</p>
<p>head if I refused to sign fifty death-warrants!  Now, am I kind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very likely it would have amounted to the same thing in the end</p>
<ul>
<li>they would kill me whether you signed it or not; so what does</li>
</ul>
<p>it matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are mistaken!  They would not kill you; at least, not</p>
<p>tonight, if I had not signed it.  They would have let you live</p>
<p>until their next meeting, which will be this night week; and I</p>
<p>would have incurred neither risk nor danger by refusing.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman glanced round the dungeon and shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know that that prospect is much more inviting than the</p>
<p>present one.  Even death is preferable to a week&#x27;s imprisonment</p>
<p>in a place like this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But in the meantime you might have escaped.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, look at this stone floor, that stone roof, these solid</p>
<p>walls, that barred and massive door; reflect that I am some forty</p>
<p>feet under ground - cannot perform impossibilities, and then ask</p>
<p>yourself how?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman, have you ever heard of good fairies visiting brave</p>
<p>knights and setting them free?&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;I am afraid the good fairies and brave knights went the way of</p>
<p>all flesh with King Arthur&#x27;s round table; and even if they were</p>
<p>in existence, none of them would take the trouble to limp down so</p>
<p>far to save such an unlucky dog as I.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you forgive me for what I have done?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your majesty, I have nothing to forgive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bah!&quot; she said, scornfully.  &quot;Do not mock me here.  My majesty,</p>
<p>forsooth! you have but fifteen minutes to live in this world, Sir</p>
<p>Norman; and if you have no better way of spending them, I will</p>
<p>tell you a strange story - my own, and all about this place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, there is nothing in the world I would like so much to</p>
<p>hear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shall hear it, then, and it may beguile the last slow</p>
<p>moments of time before you go out into eternity.&quot;</p>
<p>She set her lamp down on the floor among the rats and beetles,</p>
<p>and stood watching the small, red flame a moment with a gloomy,</p>
<p>downcast eye; and Sir Norman, gazing on the beautiful darkening</p>
<p>face, so like and yet so unlike Leoline, stood eagerly awaiting</p>
<p>what was to come.</p>

<p>Meantime, the half-hour sped.  In the crimson court the last</p>
<p>trial was over, and Lady Castlemaine, a slender little beauty of</p>
<p>eighteen  stood condemned to die.</p>
<p>&quot;Now for our other prisoner!&quot; exclaimed the dwarf with sprightly</p>
<p>animation; &quot;and while I go to the cell, you, fair ladies, and you</p>
<p>my lord, will seek the black chamber and await our coming there.&quot;</p>
<p>Ordering one of his attendants to precede him with a light, the</p>
<p>dwarf skipped jauntily away, to gloat over his victim.  He</p>
<p>reached the dungeon door, which the guards, with some trepidation</p>
<p>in their countenance, as they thought of what his highness would</p>
<p>say when he found her majesty locked in with the prisoner, threw</p>
<p>open.</p>
<p>&quot;Come forth, Sir Norman Kingsley!&quot; shouted the dwarf, rushing in.</p>
<p>&quot;Come forth and meet your doom!&quot;</p>
<p>But no Sir Norman Kingsley obeyed the pleasant invitation, and a</p>
<p>dull echo from the darkness alone answered him.  There was a lamp</p>
<p>burning on the floor, and near it lay a form, shining and specked</p>
<p>with white in the gloom.  He made for it between fear and fury,</p>
<p>but there was something red and slippery on the ground, in which</p>
<p>his foot slipped, and he fell.  Simultaneously there was a wild</p>
<p>cry from the two guards and the attendant, that was echoed by a</p>
<p>perfect screech of rage from the dwarf, as on looking down he</p>
<p>beheld Queen Miranda lying on the floor in the pool of blood, and</p>
<p>apparently quite dead, and Sir Norman Kingsley gone.</p>
<p>CHAPTER, XIV.</p>
<p>IN THE DUNGEON.</p>
<p>The interim between Miranda setting down her lamp on the dungeon</p>
<p>floor among the rats and the beetles, and the dwarf&#x27;s finding her</p>
<p>bleeding and senseless, was not more than twenty minutes, but a</p>
<p>great deal may be done in twenty minutes judiciously expended,</p>
<p>and most decidedly it was so in the present case.  Both rats and</p>
<p>beetles paused to contemplate the flickering lamp, and Miranda</p>
<p>paused to contemplate them, and Sir Norman paused to contemplate</p>
<p>her, for an instant or so in silence.  Her marvelous resemblance</p>
<p>to Leoline, in all but one thing, struck him more and more -</p>
<p>there was the same beautiful transparent colorless complexion,</p>
<p>the same light, straight, graceful figure, the same small oval</p>
<p>delicate features; the same profuse waves of shining dark hair,</p>
<p>the same large, dark, brilliant eyes; the same, little, rosy</p>
<p>pretty mouth, like one of Correggio&#x27;s smiling angels.  The one</p>
<p>thing wanting was expression - in Leoline&#x27;s face there was a kind</p>
<p>of childlike simplicity; a look half shy, half fearless, half</p>
<p>solemn in her wonderful eyes; but in this, her prototype, there</p>
<p>was nothing shy or solemn; all was cold, hard, and glittering,</p>
<p>and the brooding eyes were full of a dull, dusky fire.  She</p>
<p>looked as hard and cold and bitter, as she was beautiful; and Sir</p>
<p>Norman began to perplex himself inwardly as to what had brought</p>
<p>her here.  Surely not sympathy, for nothing wearing that face of</p>
<p>stone, could even know the meaning of such a word.  While he</p>
<p>looked at her, half wonderingly, half pityingly, half tenderly -</p>
<p>a queer word that last, but the feeling was caused by her</p>
<p>resemblance to Leoline - she had been moodily watching an old</p>
<p>gray rat, the patriarch of his tribe, who was making toward her</p>
<p>in short runs, stopping between each one to stare at her, out of</p>
<p>his unpleasantly bright eyes.  Suddenly, Miranda shut her teeth,</p>
<p>clenched her hands, and with a sort of fierce suppressed</p>
<p>ejaculation, lifted her shining foot and planted it full on the</p>
<p>rat&#x27;s head.  So sudden, so fierce, and so strong, was the stamp,</p>
<p>that the rat was crushed flat, and uttered a sharp and indignant</p>
<p>squeal of expostulation, while Sir Norman looked at her, thinking</p>
<p>she had lost her wits.  Still she ground it down with a fiercer</p>
<p>and stronger force every second; and with her eyes still fixed</p>
<p>upon it, and blazing with reddish black flame, she said, in a</p>
<p>sort of fiery hiss:</p>
<p>&quot;Look at it!  The ugly, loathsome thing!  Did you ever see</p>
<p>anything look more like him?&quot;</p>
<p>There must have been some mysterious rapport between them, for he</p>
<p>understood at once to whom the solitary personal pronoun</p>
<p>referred.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, in the general expression of countenance there is</p>
<p>rather a marked resemblance, especially in the region of the</p>
<p>teeth and eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Except that the rat&#x27;s eyes are a thousand times handsomer,&quot; she</p>
<p>broke in, with a derisive laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;But as to shape,&quot; resumed Sir Norman, eyeing the excited and</p>
<p>astonished little animal, still shrilly squealing, with the</p>
<p>glance of a connoisseur,&quot;I confess I do not see it!  The rat is</p>
<p>straight and shapely - which his highness, with all reverence be</p>
<p>it said - is not, but rather the reverse, if you will not be</p>
<p>offended at me for saying so.&quot;</p>
<p>She broke into a short laugh that had a hard, metallic ring, and</p>
<p>then her face darkened, blackened, and she ground the foot that</p>
<p>crushed the rat fiercer, and with a sort of passionate</p>
<p>vindictiveness, as if she had the head of the dwarf under her</p>
<p>heel.</p>
<p>&quot;I hate him!  I hate him!&quot; she said, through her clenched teeth</p>
<p>and though her tone was scarcely above a whisper, it was so</p>
<p>terrible in its fiery earnestness that</p>
<p>Sir Norman thrilled with repulsion.  &quot;Yes, I hate him with all my</p>
<p>heart and soul, and I wish to heaven I had him here, like this</p>
<p>rat, to trample to death under my feet!&quot;</p>
<p>Not knowing very well what reply to make to this strong and</p>
<p>heartfelt speech, which rather shocked his notions of female</p>
<p>propriety, Sir Norman stood silent, and looked reflectively after</p>
<p>the rat, which, when she permitted it at last to go free, limped</p>
<p>away with an ineffably sneaking and crest-fallen expression on</p>
<p>his hitherto animated features.  She watched it, too, with a</p>
<p>gloomy eye, and when it crawled into the darkness and was gone,</p>
<p>she looked up with a face so dark and moody that it was almost</p>
<p>sullen.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I hate him!&quot; she repeated, with a fierce moodiness that was</p>
<p>quite dreadful, &quot; yes, I hate him! and I would kill him, like</p>
<p>that rat, if I could!  He has been the curse of my whole life; he</p>
<p>has made life cursed to me; and his heart&#x27;s blood shall be shed</p>
<p>for it some day yet, I swear!&quot;</p>
<p>With all her beauty there was something so horrible in the look</p>
<p>she wore, that Sir Norman involuntarily recoiled from her.  Her</p>
<p>sharp eyes noticed it, and both grew red and fiery as two</p>
<p>devouring flames.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you, too, shrink from me, would you?  You, too, recoil in</p>
<p>horror!  Ingrate!  And I have come to save your life!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I recoil not from you, but from that which is tempting</p>
<p>you to utter words like these.  I have no reason to love him of</p>
<p>whom you speak - you, perhaps, have even less; but I would not</p>
<p>have his blood, shed in murder, on my head, for ten thousand</p>
<p>worlds!  Pardon me, but you do not mean what you say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do I not?  That remains to be seen!  I would not call it murder</p>
<p>plunging a knife into the heart of a demon incarnate like that,</p>
<p>and I would have done it long ago and he knows it, too, if I had</p>
<p>the chance!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What has he done to you to make you do bitter against him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bitter!  Oh, that word is poor and pitiful to express what I</p>
<p>feel when his name is mentioned.  Loathing and hatred come a</p>
<p>little nearer the mark, but even they are weak to express the</p>
<p>utter - the - &quot;  She stopped in a sort of white passion that</p>
<p>choked her very words.</p>
<p>&quot;They told me he was your husband,&quot; insinuated Sir Norman,</p>
<p>unutterably repelled.</p>
<p>&quot;Did they?&quot; she said, with a cold sneer, &quot;he is, too - at least</p>
<p>as far as church and state can make him; but I am no more his</p>
<p>wife at heart than I am Satan&#x27;s.  Truly of the two I should</p>
<p>prefer the latter, for then I should be wedded to something grand</p>
<ul>
<li>a fallen angel; as it is, I have the honor to be wife to a</li>
</ul>
<p>devil who never was an angel?&quot;</p>
<p>At this shocking statement Sir Norman looked helplessly round, as</p>
<p>if for relief; and Miranda, after a moment&#x27;s silence, broke into</p>
<p>another mirthless laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;Of all the pictures of ugliness you ever saw or heard of, Sir</p>
<p>Norman Kingsley, do tell me if there ever was one of them half so</p>
<p>repulsive or disgusting as that thing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really,&quot; said Sir Norman, in a subdued tone, &quot;he is not the most</p>
<p>prepossessing little man in the world; but, madame, you do look</p>
<p>and speak in a manner quite dreadful.  Do let me prevail on you</p>
<p>to calm yourself, and tell me your story, as you promised.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Calm myself!&quot; repeated the gentle lady, in a tone half snappish,</p>
<p>half harsh, &quot;do you think I am made of iron, to tell you my story</p>
<p>and be calm?  I hate him!  I hate him!  I would kill him if I</p>
<p>could: and if you, Sir Norman, are half the man I take you to be,</p>
<p>you will rid the world of the horrible monster before morning</p>
<p>dawns!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear lady, you seem to forget that the case is reversed, and</p>
<p>that he is going to rid the world of me,&quot;, said Sir Norman, with</p>
<p>a sigh.</p>
<p>&quot;No, not if you do as I tell you; and when I have told you how</p>
<p>much cause I have to abhor him, you will agree with me that</p>
<p>killing him will be no murder!  Oh, if there is One above who</p>
<p>rules this world, and will judge us all, why, why does He permit</p>
<p>such monsters to live?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because He is more merciful than his creatures,&quot; replied Sir</p>
<p>Norman, with calm reverence, - though His avenging hand is heavy</p>
<p>on this doomed city.  But, madame, time is on the wing, and the</p>
<p>headsman will be here before your story is told.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, that story!  How am I to tell it, I wonder, two words will</p>
<p>comprise it all - sin and misery - misery and sin!  For, buried</p>
<p>alive here, as I am - buried alive, as I&#x27;ve always been - I know</p>
<p>what both words mean; they have been branded on heart and brain</p>
<p>in letters of fire.  And that horrible monstrosity is the cause</p>
<p>of all  - that loathsome, misshapen, hideous abortion has banned</p>
<p>and cursed my whole life!  He is my first recollection.  As far</p>
<p>back as I can look through the dim eye of childhood&#x27;s years, that</p>
<p>horrible face, that gnarled and twisted trunk, those devilish</p>
<p>eyes glare at me like the eyes and face of a wild beast.  As</p>
<p>memory grows stronger and more vivid, I can see that same face</p>
<p>still - the dwarf! the dwarf! the dwarf! - Satan&#x27;s true</p>
<p>representative on earth, darkening and blighting ever passing</p>
<p>year.  I do not know where we lived, but I imagine it to have</p>
<p>been one of the vilest and lowest dens in London, though the</p>
<p>rooms I occupied were, for that matter, decent and orderly</p>
<p>enough.  Those rooms the daylight never entered, the windows were</p>
<p>boarded up within, and fastened by shutters without, so that of</p>
<p>the world beyond I was as ignorant as a child of two hours old.</p>
<p>I saw but two human faces, his&quot; - she seemed to hate him too much</p>
<p>even to pronounce his name - &quot;and his housekeeper&#x27;s, a creature</p>
<p>almost as vile as himself, and who is now a servant here; and</p>
<p>with this precious pair to guard me I grew up to be fifteen years</p>
<p>old.  My outer life consisted of eating, sleeping, reading - for</p>
<p>the wretch taught me to read - playing with my dogs and birds,</p>
<p>and listening to old Margery&#x27;s stories.  But there was an inward</p>
<p>life, fierce and strong, as it was rank and morbid, lived and</p>
<p>brooded over alone, when Margery and her master fancied me</p>
<p>sleeping in idiotic content.  How were they to know that the</p>
<p>creature they had reared and made ever had a thought of her own -</p>
<p>ever wondered who she was, where she came from, what she was</p>
<p>destined to be, and what lay in the great world beyond?  The</p>
<p>crooked little monster made a great mistake in teaching me to</p>
<p>read, he should have known that books sow seed that grow up and</p>
<p>flourish tall and green, till they become giants in strength.  I</p>
<p>knew enough to be certain there was a bright and glad world</p>
<p>without, from which they shut me in and debarred me; and I knew</p>
<p>enough to hate them both for it, with a strong and heartfelt</p>
<p>hatred, only second to what I feel now.&quot;</p>
<p>She stopped for a moment, and fixed her dark, gloomy eyes on the</p>
<p>swarming floor, and shook off, with out a shudder, the hideous</p>
<p>things that crawled over her rich dress.  She had scarcely looked</p>
<p>at Sir Norman since she began to speak, but he had done enough</p>
<p>looking for them both, never once taking his eyes from the</p>
<p>handsome darkening face.  He thought how strangely like her story</p>
<p>was to Leoline&#x27;s - both shut in and isolated from the outer</p>
<p>world.  Verily, destiny seemed to have woven the woof and warp of</p>
<p>their fates wonderfully together, for their lives were as much</p>
<p>the same as their faces.  Miranda, having shook off her crawling</p>
<p>acquaintances, watched them glancing along the foul floor in the</p>
<p>darkness, and went moodily on.</p>
<p>&quot;It was three years ago when I was fifteen years old, as I told</p>
<p>you, that a change took place in my life.  Up to that time, that</p>
<p>miserable dwarf was what people would call my guardian, and did</p>
<p>not trouble me much with his heavenly company.  He was a great</p>
<p>deal from our house, sometimes absent for weeks together; and I</p>
<p>remember I used to envy the freedom with which he came and went,</p>
<p>far more than I ever wondered where he spent his precious time.</p>
<p>I did not know then that he belonged to the honorable profession</p>
<p>of highwaymen, with variations of coining when travelers were few</p>
<p>and money scarce.  He was then, and is still, at the head of a</p>
<p>formidable gang, over whom he wields most desperate authority -</p>
<p>as perhaps you have noticed during the brief and pleasant period</p>
<p>of your acquaintance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really, madam, it struck me that your authority over them was</p>
<p>much more despotic than his,&quot; said Sir Norman, in all sincerity,</p>
<p>feeling called upon to give the - well, I&#x27;d rather not repeat the</p>
<p>word, which is generally spelled with a d and a dash - his due.</p>
<p>&quot;No thanks to him for that!  He would make me a slave now, as he</p>
<p>did then, if he dared, but he has found that, poor, trodden worm</p>
<p>as I was, I had life enough left to turn and sting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which you do with a vengeance!  Oh I you&#x27;re a Tartar!&quot; remarked</p>
<p>Sir Norman to himself.  &quot;The saints forefend that Leoline should</p>
<p>be like you in temper, as she is in history and face; for if she</p>
<p>is, my life promises to be a pleasant one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This rascally crew of cut-throats, whom his villainous highness</p>
<p>headed,&quot; said Miranda, &quot;were an almost immense number then, being</p>
<p>divided in three bodies - London cut-purses, Hounslow Heath</p>
<p>highwaymen, and assistant-coiners, but all owning him for their</p>
<p>lord and master.  He told me all this himself, one day when, in</p>
<p>an after-dinner and most gracious mood, he made a boasting</p>
<p>display of his wealth and greatness; told me I was growing up</p>
<p>very pretty indeed, and that I was shortly to be raised to the</p>
<p>honor and dignity, and bliss of being his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;I fancy I must have had a very vague idea of what that one small</p>
<p>word meant, and was besides in an unusually contented and</p>
<p>peaceful state of mind, or I should, undoubtedly, have raised one</p>
<p>of his cut-glass decanters and smashed in his head with it.  I</p>
<p>know how I should receive such an assertion from him now, but I</p>
<p>think I took it then with a resignation, he must have found</p>
<p>mighty edifying; and when he went on to tell me that all this</p>
<p>richness and greatness were to be shared by me when that</p>
<p>celestial time came, I think I rather liked the idea than</p>
<p>otherwise.  The horrible creature seemed to have woke up that</p>
<p>day, for the first time, and all of a sudden, to a conviction</p>
<p>that I was in a fair way to become a woman, and rather a handsome</p>
<p>one, and that he had better make sure of me before any accident</p>
<p>interfered to take me from him.  Full of this laudable notion, he</p>
<p>became a daily visitor of mine from thenceforth, and made the</p>
<p>discovery, simultaneously with myself, that the oftener he came</p>
<p>the less favor he found in my sight.  I had, before, tacitly</p>
<p>disliked him, and shrank with a natural repulsion from his</p>
<p>dreadful ugliness ness; but now, from negative dislike, I grew to</p>
<p>positive hate.  The utter loathing and abhorrence I have had for</p>
<p>him ever since, began then - I grew dimly and intuitively</p>
<p>conscious of what he would make me, and shrank from my fate with</p>
<p>a vague horror not to be told in words.  I became strong in my</p>
<p>fearful dread of it.  I told him I detested, abhorred, loathed,</p>
<p>hated him; that he might keep his riches, greatness, and ungainly</p>
<p>self for those who wanted him; they were temptations too weak to</p>
<p>move me.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, there was raving, and storming, threatening, terrible</p>
<p>looks and denunciations, and I quailed and shrank like a coward,</p>
<p>but was obstinate still.  Then as a dernier resort, he tried</p>
<p>another bribe - the glorious one of liberty, the one he knew</p>
<p>would conquer me, and it did.  He promised me freedom - if I</p>
<p>married him, I might go out into the great unknown world,</p>
<p>fetterless and free; and I, O! fool that I was! consented.  Not</p>
<p>that my object was to stay with him one instant longer her my</p>
<p>prison doors were opened; no, I was not quite so besotted as that</p>
<ul>
<li>once out, and the little demon might look for me with last</li>
</ul>
<p>year&#x27;s partridges.  Of course, those demoniac eyes read my heart</p>
<p>like an open book; and when I pronounced the fatal &#x27;yes,&#x27; he</p>
<p>laughed in that delightful way of his own, which will probably be</p>
<p>the last thing you will hear when you lay your head under the</p>
<p>axe.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know who the clergyman who married us was; but he was a</p>
<p>clergyman:  there can be no doubt about that.  It was three days</p>
<p>after, and for the first time in my fifteen years of life, I</p>
<p>stood in sunshine, and daylight, and open air.  We drove to the</p>
<p>cathedral - for it was in St. Paul&#x27;s the sacrilege was committed.</p>
<p>I never could have walked there, I was so stunned, and giddy, and</p>
<p>bewildered.  I never thought of the marriage - I could think of</p>
<p>nothing but the bright, crashing, sun-shiny world without, till I</p>
<p>was led up before the clergyman, with much the air, I suppose, of</p>
<p>one walking in her sleep.  He was a very young man, I remember,</p>
<p>and looked from the dwarf to me, and from me to the dwarf, in a</p>
<p>great state of fear and uncertainty, but evidently not daring to</p>
<p>refuse.  Margery and one of his gang were our only attendants,</p>
<p>and there, in God&#x27;s temple, the deed was done, and I was made the</p>
<p>miserable thing I am to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>The suppressed passion, rising and throbbing like a white flame</p>
<p>in her face and eyes, made her stop for a moment, breathing hard.</p>
<p>Looking up she met Sir Norman&#x27;s gaze, and as if there was</p>
<p>something in its quiet, pitying tenderness that mesmerized her</p>
<p>into calm, she steadily and rapidly went on.</p>
<p>&quot;I awoke to a new life, after that; but not to one of freedom and</p>
<p>happiness.  I was as closely, even more closely, guarded than</p>
<p>ever; and I found, when too late, that I had bartered myself,</p>
<p>soul and body, for an empty promise.  The only difference was,</p>
<p>that I saw more new faces; for the dwarf began to bring his</p>
<p>confederates and subordinates to the house, and would have me</p>
<p>dressed up and displayed to them, with a demoniac pride that</p>
<p>revolted me beyond everything else, if I were a painted puppet or</p>
<p>an overgrown wax doll.  Most of the precious crew of scoundrels</p>
<p>had wives of their own and these began to be brought with them of</p>
<p>an evening; and then, what with dancing, and music, and cards,</p>
<p>and feasting, we had quite a carnival of it til] morning.</p>
<p>&quot;I liked this part of the business excessively well at first, and</p>
<p>I was flattered and fooled to the top of my bent, and made from</p>
<p>the first, the reigning belle and queen.  There was more policy</p>
<p>in that than admiration, I fancy; for the dwarf was all-powerful</p>
<p>among them and dreaded accordingly, and I was the dwarf&#x27;s pet and</p>
<p>plaything, and all-powerful with him.  The hideous creature had a</p>
<p>most hideous passion for me then, and I could wind him round my</p>
<p>finger as easily as Delilah and Samson; and by his command and</p>
<p>their universal consent, the mimicry of royalty was begun, and I</p>
<p>was made mistress and sovereign head, even over the dwarf</p>
<p>himself.  It was a queer whim; but that crooked slug was always</p>
<p>taking such odd notions into his head, which nobody there dared</p>
<p>laugh at.  The band were bound together by a terrible oath, women</p>
<p>and all; but they had to take another oath then, that of</p>
<p>allegiance to me.</p>
<p>&quot;It quite turned my brain at first; and my eyes were so dazzled</p>
<p>by the pitiful glistening of the pageant, the sham splendor of</p>
<p>the sham court, and the half-mocking, half-serious homage paid</p>
<p>me, that I could see nothing beyond the shining surface, and the</p>
<p>blackness, and corruption, and horror within, were altogether</p>
<p>lost upon me.  This feeling increased when, as months and months</p>
<p>went by, they were added to the mock peers of the Midnight Court,</p>
<p>real nobles from that of St. Charles.  I did not know then that</p>
<p>they were ruined gamesters, vicious profligates, and desperate</p>
<p>broken-down roues, who would have gone to pandemonium itself,</p>
<p>nightly, for the mad license and lawless excesses they could</p>
<p>indulge in here to their heart&#x27;s content.  But I got tired of it</p>
<p>all, after a time:  my eyes began slowly to open, and my heart -</p>
<p>at least, what little of that article I ever had - turned sick</p>
<p>with horror within me at what I had done.  The awful things I</p>
<p>saw, the fearful deeds that were perpetrated, would curdle your</p>
<p>very blood with horror, were I to relate them.  You have seen a</p>
<p>specimen yourself, in the cold-blooded murder of that wretch half</p>
<p>an hour ago; and his is not the only life crying for vengeance on</p>
<p>these men.  The slightest violation of their oath was punished,</p>
<p>and the doom of traitors and informers was instant death, whether</p>
<p>male or female.  The sham trials and executions always took place</p>
<p>in presence of the whole court, to strike a salutary terror into</p>
<p>them, and never occurred but once a week, when the whole band</p>
<p>regularly met.  My power continued undiminished; for they knew</p>
<p>either the dwarf or I must be supreme; and though the queen was</p>
<p>bad, the prince was worse.  The said prince would willingly have</p>
<p>pulled me down from my eminence, and have mounted it himself; but</p>
<p>that he was probably restrained by a feeling that law-makers</p>
<p>should not be law-breakers, and that, if he set the example,</p>
<p>there would be no end to the insubordination and rebellion that</p>
<p>would follow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were you living here or in London then?&quot; inquired Sir Norman,</p>
<p>taking an advantage of a pause, employed by Miranda in shaking</p>
<p>off the crawling beetles.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, in London!  We did not come here until the outbreak of the</p>
<p>plague - that frightened them, especially the female portion, and</p>
<p>they held a scared meeting, and resolved that we should take up</p>
<p>our quarters somewhere else.  This place being old and ruined,</p>
<p>and deserted and with all sorts of evil rumors hanging about it,</p>
<p>was hit upon; and secretly, by night, these mouldering old vaults</p>
<p>were fitted up, and the goods and chattels of the royal court</p>
<p>removed.  And here I, too, was brought by night under the dwarf&#x27;s</p>
<p>own eye; for he well knew I would have risked a thousand plagues</p>
<p>to escape from him.  And here I have been ever since, and here</p>
<p>the weekly revels are still held, and may for years to come,</p>
<p>unless something is done to-night to prevent it.</p>
<p>&quot;The night before these weekly anniversaries they all gather; but</p>
<p>during the rest of the time I am alone with Margery and the</p>
<p>dwarf, and have learned more secrets about this place than they</p>
<p>dream of.  For the rest, there is little need of explanation -</p>
<p>the dwarf and his crew have industriously circulated the rumor</p>
<p>that it is haunted; and some of those white figures you saw with</p>
<p>me, and who, by the way, are the daughters of these robbers, have</p>
<p>been shown on the broken battlements, as if to put the fact</p>
<p>beyond doubt.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, Sir Norman, that is all - you have heard my whole history</p>
<p>as far as I know it; and nothing remains but to tell you what you</p>
<p>must see yourself, that I am mad for revenge, and must have it,</p>
<p>and you must help me!&quot;</p>
<p>Her eyes were shining with the fierce red fire he had seen in</p>
<p>them before, and the white face wore a look so deadly and</p>
<p>diabolical that, with all its beauty, it was absolutely</p>
<p>repulsive.  He took a step from her-for in each of those gleaming</p>
<p>eyes sat a devil.</p>
<p>&quot;You must help me!&quot; she persisted.  &quot; You - you, Sir Norman!  For</p>
<p>many a day I have been waiting for a chance like this, and until</p>
<p>now I have waited in vain.  Alone, I want physical strength to</p>
<p>kill him, and I dare not trust any one else.  No one was ever</p>
<p>cast among us before as you have been; and now, condemned to die,</p>
<p>you must be desperate, and desperate men will do desperate</p>
<p>things.  Fate, Destiny, Providence - whatever you like - has</p>
<p>thrown you in my way, and help me you must and shall!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, madame I what are you saying?  How can I help you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is but one way - this!&quot;</p>
<p>She held up in the pale ray of the lamp, something she drew from</p>
<p>the folds of her dress, that glistened blue, and bright, and</p>
<p>steelly in the gloom.</p>
<p>&quot;A dagger!&quot; he exclaimed, with a shudder, and a recoil.  &quot;Madame,</p>
<p>are you talking of murder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told you!&quot; she said, through her closed teeth, and with her</p>
<p>eyes flaming like fire, &quot;that ridding the earth of that fiend</p>
<p>incarnate would be a good deed, and no murder!  I would do it</p>
<p>myself if I could take him off his guard; but he never is that</p>
<p>with me; and then my arm is not strong enough to reach his black</p>
<p>heart through all that mass of brawn, and blood, and muscle.  No,</p>
<p>Sir Norman, Doom has allotted it to you - obey, and I swear to</p>
<p>you, you shall go free; refuse - and in ten minutes your head</p>
<p>will roll under the executioner&#x27;s axe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better that than the freedom you offer!  Madame, I cannot</p>
<p>murder!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coward!&quot; she passionately cried; &quot;you fear to do it, and yet you</p>
<p>have but a life to lose, and that is lost to you now!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman raised his head; and even in the darkness she saw the</p>
<p>haughty flush that crimsoned his face.</p>
<p>&quot;I fear no man living; but, madame, I fear One who is higher than</p>
<p>man!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you will die if you refuse; and I repeat, again and again,</p>
<p>there is no risk.  These guards will not let you out; but there</p>
<p>are more ways of leaving a room than through the door, and I can</p>
<p>lead you up behind the tapestry to where he is standing, and you</p>
<p>can stab him through the back, and escape with me! Quick, quick,</p>
<p>there is no time to lose!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot do it !&quot; he said, resolutely, drawing back and folding</p>
<p>his arms.  &quot;In short, I will not do it!&quot;</p>
<p>There was such a terrible look in the beautiful eyes, that he</p>
<p>half expected to see her spring at him like a wild cat, and bury</p>
<p>the dagger in his own breast.   But the rule of life works by</p>
<p>contraries: expect a blow and you will get a kiss, look for an</p>
<p>embrace, and you will be startled by a kick.  When the virago</p>
<p>spoke, her voice was calm, compared with what it had been before,</p>
<p>even mild.</p>
<p>&quot;You refuse!  Well, a willful man must have him way; and since</p>
<p>you are so qualmish about a little bloodletting, we must try</p>
<p>another plan.  If I release you - for short as the time is, I can</p>
<p>do it - will you promise me to go direct to the king this very</p>
<p>night, and inform him of all you&#x27;ve seen and heard here?&quot;</p>
<p>She looked at him with an eagerness that was almost fierce; and</p>
<p>in spite of her steady voice, there was something throbbing and</p>
<p>quivering, deadly and terrible, in her upturned face.  The form</p>
<p>she looked at was erect and immovable, the eyes were quietly</p>
<p>resolved, the mouth half-pityingly, half-sadly smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you aware, dear lady, what the result of such a step would</p>
<p>be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Death!&quot; she said, coldly.</p>
<p>&quot;Death, transportation, or life-long imprisonment to them all -</p>
<p>misery and disgrace to many a noble house; for some I saw there</p>
<p>were once friends of mine, with families I honor and respect.</p>
<p>Could I bring the dwarf and his attendant imps to Tyburn, and</p>
<p>treat them to a hempen cravat, I would do it without remorse -</p>
<p>though the notion of being informer, even then, would not be very</p>
<p>pleasant; but as it is, I cannot be the death of one without</p>
<p>ruining all, and as I told you, some of those were once my</p>
<p>friends.  No, madame, I cannot do it.  I have but once to die and</p>
<p>I prefer death here, to purchasing life at such a price.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a short silence, during which they gazed into each</p>
<p>other&#x27;s eyes ominously, and one was about as colorless as the</p>
<p>other.</p>
<p>&quot;You refuse?&quot; she coldly said.</p>
<p>&quot;I must!  But if you can save my life, as you say, why not do it,</p>
<p>and fly with me?  You will find me the truest and most grateful</p>
<p>of friends, while life remains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are very kind; but I want no friendship, Sir Norman -</p>
<p>nothing but revenge!  As to escaping, I could have done that any</p>
<p>time since we came here, for I have found out a secret means of</p>
<p>exit from each of these vaults, that they know nothing of.  But I</p>
<p>have staid to see him dead at my feet - if not by my hand, at</p>
<p>least by my command; and since you will not do it, I will make</p>
<p>the attempt myself.  Farewell, Sir Norman Kingsley; before many</p>
<p>minutes you will be a corpse, and your blood be upon yourself!&quot;</p>
<p>She gave him a glance as coldly fierce as her dagger&#x27;s glance,</p>
<p>and turned to go, when he stepped hastily forward, and</p>
<p>interposed:</p>
<p>&quot;Miranda - Miranda - you are crazed!  Stop and tell me what you</p>
<p>intend to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What you feared to attempt,&quot; she haughtily replied; &quot;Sheathe</p>
<p>this dagger in his demon heart!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miranda, give me the dagger.  You must not, you shall not,</p>
<p>commit such a crime!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shall not?&quot; she uttered scornfully.  &quot;And who are you that dares</p>
<p>to speak to me like this?  Stand aside, coward, and let me pass!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon me, but I cannot, while you hold that dagger.  Give it to</p>
<p>me, and you shall go free; but while you hold it with this</p>
<p>intention, for your own sake, I will detain you till some one</p>
<p>comes.&quot;</p>
<p>She uttered a low, fierce cry, and struck at him with it, but he</p>
<p>caught her hand, and with sudden force snatched it from her.  In</p>
<p>doing so he was obliged to hold it with its point toward her, and</p>
<p>struggling for it in a sort of frenzy, as he raised the hand that</p>
<p>held it, she slipped forward and it was driven half-way to the</p>
<p>hilt in her side.  There was a low, grasping cry - a sudden</p>
<p>clasping of both hands over her heart, a sway, a reel, and she</p>
<p>fell headlong prostrate on the loathsome floor.</p>
<p>Sir Norman stood paralyzed.  She half raised herself on her</p>
<p>elbow, drew the dagger from the wound, and a great jet of blood</p>
<p>shot up and crimsoned her hands.  She did not faint - there</p>
<p>seemed to be a deathless energy within her that chained life</p>
<p>strongly in its place - she only pressed both hands hard over the</p>
<p>wound, and looked  mournfully and reproachfully up in his face.</p>
<p>Those beautiful, sad, solemn dyes, void of everything savage and</p>
<p>fierce, were truly Leoline&#x27;s eyes now.</p>
<p>Through all his first shock of horror, another thing dawned on</p>
<p>his mind; he had looked on this scene before.  It was the second</p>
<p>view in La Masque&#x27;s caldron, and but one remained to be verified</p>
<p>The next instant, he was down on his knees in a paroxysm of grief</p>
<p>and despair.</p>
<p>&quot;What have I done?  what have I done?&quot; was his cry.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen!&quot; she said, faintly raising one finger.  &quot;Do you hear</p>
<p>that?&quot;</p>
<p>Distant steps were echoing along the passage.  Yes; he heard</p>
<p>them, and knew what they were.</p>
<p>&quot;They are coming to lead you to death!&quot; she said, with some of</p>
<p>her old fire; &quot;but I will baffle them yet.  Take that lamp - go</p>
<p>to the wall yonder, and in that corner, near the floor, you will</p>
<p>see a small iron ring.  Pull it - it does not require much force</p>
<ul>
<li>and you will find an opening leading through another vault; at</li>
</ul>
<p>the end there is a broken flight of stairs, mount them, and you</p>
<p>will find yourself in the same place from which you fell.  Fly,</p>
<p>fly!  There is not a second to lose!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can I fly? how can I leave you dying here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not dying!&quot; she wildly cried, lifting both hands from the</p>
<p>wound to push him away, while the blood flowed over the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;But we will both die if you stay.  Go-go-go!&quot;</p>
<p>The footsteps had paused st his door.  The bolts were beginning</p>
<p>to be withdrawn.  He lifted the lamp, flew across his prison,</p>
<p>found the ring, and took a pull at it with desperate strength.</p>
<p>Part of what appeared to be the solid wall drew out, disclosing</p>
<p>an aperture through which he could just squeeze sideways.  Quick</p>
<p>as thought he was through, forgetting the lamp in his haste.  The</p>
<p>portion of the wall slid noiselessly back, just as the prison</p>
<p>door was thrown open, and the dwarfs voice was heard, socially</p>
<p>inviting him, like Mrs. Bond&#x27;s ducks, to come and be killed.</p>
<p>Some people talk of darkness so palpable that it may be felt, and</p>
<p>if ever any one was qualified to tell from experience what it</p>
<p>felt like, Sir Norman was in that precise condition at that</p>
<p>precise period.  He groped his way through the blind blackness</p>
<p>along what seemed an interminable distance, and stumbled, at</p>
<p>last, over the broken stairs at the end.  With some difficult,</p>
<p>and at the serious risk of his jugular, he mounted them, and</p>
<p>found himself, as Miranda had stated, in a place he knew very</p>
<p>well.  Once here he allowed no grass to grow under him feet; and,</p>
<p>in five minutes after, to his great delight, he found himself</p>
<p>where he had never hoped to be again - in the serene moonlight</p>
<p>and the open air, fetterless and free.</p>
<p>His horse was still where he had left him, and in a twinkling he</p>
<p>was on his back, and dashing away to the city, to love - to</p>
<p>Leoline!</p>
<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
<p>LEOLINE&#x27;S VISITORS.</p>
<p>If things were done right - but they are not and, never will be,</p>
<p>while this whirligig world of mistakes spins round, and all</p>
<p>Adam&#x27;s children, to the end of the chapter, will continue sinning</p>
<p>to-day and repenting tomorrow, falling the next and bewailing it</p>
<p>the day after.  If Leoline had gone to bed directly, like a good,</p>
<p>dutiful little girl, as Sir Norman ordered her, she would have</p>
<p>saved herself a good deal of trouble and tears; but Leoline and</p>
<p>sleep were destined to shake hands and turn their backs on each</p>
<p>other that night.  It was time for all honest folks to be in bed,</p>
<p>and the dark-eyed beauty knew it too, but she had no notion of</p>
<p>going, nevertheless.  She stood in the centre of the room, where</p>
<p>he had left her, with a spot like a scarlet roseberry on either</p>
<p>cheek; a soft half-smile on the perfect mouth, and a light</p>
<p>unexpressibly tender and dreamy, in those artesian wells of</p>
<p>beauty - her eyes.  Most young girls of green and tender years,</p>
<p>suffering from &quot;Love&#x27;s young dream,&quot; and that sort of thing, have</p>
<p>just that soft, shy, brooding look, whenever their thoughts</p>
<p>happen to turn to their particular beloved; and there are few</p>
<p>eyes so ugly that it does not beautify, even should they be as</p>
<p>cross as two sticks.  You should have seen Leoline standing in</p>
<p>the centre of her pretty room, with her bright rose-satin</p>
<p>glancing and glittering, and flowing over rug and mat; with her</p>
<p>black waving hair clustering and curling like shining floss silk;</p>
<p>with a rich white shimmer of pearls on the pale smooth forehead</p>
<p>and large beautiful arms.  She did look irresistibly bewitching</p>
<p>beyond doubt; and it was just as well for Sir Norman&#x27;s peace of</p>
<p>mind that he did not see her, for he was bad enough without that.</p>
<p>So she stood thinking tenderly of him for a half-hour or so,</p>
<p>quite undisturbed by the storm; and how strange it was that she</p>
<p>had risen up that very morning expecting to be one man&#x27;s bride,</p>
<p>and that she should rise up the next, expecting to be another&#x27;s.</p>
<p>She could not realize it at all; and with a little sigh-half</p>
<p>pleasure, half presentiment - she walked to the window, drew the</p>
<p>curtain, and looked out at the night.  All was peaceful and</p>
<p>serene; the moon was fall to overflowing, and a great deal of</p>
<p>extra light ran over the brim; quite a quantity of stars were</p>
<p>out, and were winking pleasantly down at the dark little planet</p>
<p>below, that went round, and round, with grim stoicism, and paid</p>
<p>no attention to anybody&#x27;s business but its own.  She saw the</p>
<p>heaps of black, charred ashes that the rush of rain had quenched;</p>
<p>she saw the still and empty street; the frowning row of gloomy</p>
<p>houses opposite, and the man on guard before one of them.  She</p>
<p>had watched that man all day, thinking, with a sick shudder, of</p>
<p>the plague-stricken prisoners he guarded, and reading its piteous</p>
<p>inscription, &quot;Lord have mercy on us!&quot; till the words seemed</p>
<p>branded on her brain.  While she looked now, an upper window was</p>
<p>opened, a night-cap was thrust out and s voice from its cavernous</p>
<p>depths hailed the guard.</p>
<p>&quot;Robert!  I say, Robert!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well!&quot; said Robert, looking up.</p>
<p>&quot;Master and missus be gone at last, and the rest won&#x27;t live till</p>
<p>morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Won&#x27;t they?&quot; said Robert, phlegmatically; &quot;what a pity!  Got &#x27;em</p>
<p>ready, and I&#x27;ll stop the dead-cart when it comes round.&quot;</p>
<p>Just as he spoke, the well-known rattle of wheels, the loud</p>
<p>ringing of the bell, and the monotonous cry of the driver, &quot;Bring</p>
<p>out your dead! bring out your dead!&quot; echoed on the pale night&#x27;s</p>
<p>silence; and the pest-cart came rumbling and jolting along with</p>
<p>its load of death.  The watchman hailed the driver, according to</p>
<p>promise, and they entered the house together, brought out one</p>
<p>long, white figure, and then another, and threw them on top of</p>
<p>the ghastly heap.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;ll have three more for you in on hour of so - don&#x27;t forget to</p>
<p>come round,&quot; suggested the watchman.</p>
<p>&quot;All right!&quot; said the driver, as he took his place, whipped his</p>
<p>horse, rang his bell, and jogged along nonchalantly to the</p>
<p>plague-pit.</p>
<p>Sick at heart, Leoline dropped the curtain, and turned round to</p>
<p>see somebody else standing at her elbow.  She had been quite</p>
<p>alone when she looked out; she was alone no longer; there had</p>
<p>been no noise, yet soma one had entered, and was standing beside</p>
<p>her.  A tall figure, all in black, with its sweeping velvet robes</p>
<p>spangled with stars of golden rubies, a perfect figure of</p>
<p>incomparable grace and beauty.  It had worn a cloak that had</p>
<p>dropped lightly from its shoulders, and lay on the floor and the</p>
<p>long hair streamed in darkness over shoulder and waist.   The</p>
<p>face was masked, the form stood erect and perfectly motionless,</p>
<p>and the scream of surprise and consternation that arose to</p>
<p>Leoline&#x27;s lips died out in wordless terror.  Her noiseless</p>
<p>visitor perceived it, and touching her arm lightly with one</p>
<p>little white hand, said in her sweetest and most exquisite of</p>
<p>tones:</p>
<p>&quot;My child, do not tremble so, and do not look so deathly white.</p>
<p>You know me, do you not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are La Masque!&quot; said Leoline trembling with nervous dread.</p>
<p>&quot;I am, and no stranger to you; though perhaps you think so.  Is</p>
<p>it your habit every night to look out of your window in full</p>
<p>dress until morning?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you enter?&quot; asked Leoline, her curiosity overcoming for</p>
<p>a moment even her fear.</p>
<p>&quot;Through the door.  Not a difficult thing, either, if you leave</p>
<p>it wide open every night, as it is this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was it open?&quot; said Leoline, in dismay.  &quot;I never knew it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! then it was not you who went out last.  Who was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was - was - &quot; Leoline&#x27;s cheeks were scarlet; &quot;it was a</p>
<p>friend!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A somewhat late hour for one&#x27;s friends to visit,&quot; said La</p>
<p>Masque, sarcastically; &quot;and you should learn the precaution of</p>
<p>seeing them to the door and fastening it after them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rest assured, I shall do so for the future,&quot; said Leoline, with</p>
<p>a look that would have reminded Sir Nor man of Miranda had he</p>
<p>seen it.  &quot;I scarcely expected the honor of any more visits,</p>
<p>particularly from strangers to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Civil, that!  Will you ask me to sit down, or am I to consider</p>
<p>myself an unseasonable intruder, and depart?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, will you do me the honor to be seated.  The hour, as you</p>
<p>say, is somewhat unseasonable, and you will oblige me by letting</p>
<p>me know to what I am indebted for the pleasure of this visit, as</p>
<p>quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>There was something quite dignified about Mistress Leoline as she</p>
<p>swept rustling past La Masque, sank into the pillowy depths of</p>
<p>her lounge, and motioned her visitor to a seat with a slight and</p>
<p>graceful wave of her hand.  Not but that in her secret heart she</p>
<p>was a good deal frightened, for something under her pink satin</p>
<p>corsage was going pit-a-pat at a wonderful rate; but she thought</p>
<p>that betraying such a feeling would not be the thing.  Perhaps</p>
<p>the tall, dark figure saw it, and smiled behind her mask; but</p>
<p>outwardly she only leaned lightly against the back of the chair,</p>
<p>and glanced discreetly at the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure we are quite alone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because,&quot; said La Masque, in her low, silvery tones, &quot;what I</p>
<p>have come to say is not for the ears of any third person living:&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are entirely alone, madame,&quot; replied Leoline, opening her</p>
<p>black eyes very wide.  &quot;Prudence is gone, and I do not know when</p>
<p>she will be back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prudence will never come back,&quot; said La Masque, quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, do not look so shocked - it is not her fault.  You know</p>
<p>she deserted you for fear of the plague.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that did not save her; nay, it even brought on what she</p>
<p>dreaded so much.  Your nurse is plague-stricken, my dear, and</p>
<p>lies ill unto death in the pesthouse in Finsbury Fields.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, dreadful!&quot; exclaimed Leoline, while every drop of blood fled</p>
<p>from her face.  &quot;My poor, poor old nurse!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your poor, poor old nurse left you without much tenderness when</p>
<p>she thought you dying of the same disease,&quot; said La Masque,</p>
<p>quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that is nothing.  The suddenness, the shock drove her to it.</p>
<p>My poor, dear Prudence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you can do nothing for her now,&quot; said La Masque, in a tone</p>
<p>of slight impatience.  &quot;Prudence is beyond all human aid, and so</p>
<ul>
<li>let her rest in peace.  You were carried to the plague-pit</li>
</ul>
<p>yourself, for dead, were you not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered the pale lips, while she shivered all over at the</p>
<p>recollection.</p>
<p>&quot;And was saved by - by whom were you saved, my dear?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By two gentlemen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I know that; what were their names?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One was Mr. Ormiston, the other was,&quot; hesitating and blushing</p>
<p>vividly, &quot;Sir Norman Kingsley.&quot;</p>
<p>La Masque leaned across her chair, and laid one dainty finger</p>
<p>lightly on the girl&#x27;s hot cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;And for which is that blush, Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, was it only to ask me questions you came here?&quot; said</p>
<p>Leoline, drawing proudly back, though the hot red spot grew</p>
<p>hotter and redder; &quot;if so, you will excuse my declining to answer</p>
<p>any more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Child, child!&quot; said La Masque, in a tone so strangely sad that</p>
<p>it touched Leoline, &quot;do not be angry with me.  It is no idle</p>
<p>curiosity that sent me here at this hour to ask impertinent</p>
<p>questions, but a claim that I have upon you, stronger than that</p>
<p>of any one else in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline&#x27;s beautiful eyes opened wider yet.,</p>
<p>&quot;A claim upon me!  How?  Why?  I do not understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All in good time.  Will you tell me something of your past</p>
<p>history, Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame Masque, I have no history to tell.  All my life I have</p>
<p>lived alone with Prudence; that in the whole of it in nine</p>
<p>words.&quot;</p>
<p>La Masque half laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Short, sharp, and decisive.  Had you never father or mother?&quot;</p>
<p>There is a slight probability I may have had at some past</p>
<p>period,&quot; said Leoline, sighing; &quot;but none that I ever knew.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why does not Prudence tell you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Prudence is only my nurse, and says she has nothing to tell.  My</p>
<p>parents died when I was an infant, and left me in her care - that</p>
<p>is her story.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A likely one enough, and yet I see by your face that you doubt</p>
<p>it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do doubt it!  There are a thousand little outward things that</p>
<p>make me fancy it is false, and an inward voice that assures me it</p>
<p>is so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then let me tell you that inward voice tells falsehoods, for I</p>
<p>know that your father and mother are both dead these fourteen</p>
<p>years!&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline&#x27;s great black eyes were fixed on her face with a look so</p>
<p>wild and eager, that La Masque laid her hand lightly and</p>
<p>soothingly on her shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t look at me with such a spectral face!  What is there so</p>
<p>extraordinary in all I have said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You said you knew my father and mother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No such thing!  I said I knew they were dead, but the other fact</p>
<p>is true also; I did know them when living!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, who are you?  Who were they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I?  Oh, I am La Masque, the sorceress, and they - they were</p>
<p>Leoline&#x27;s father and mother!&quot; and again La Masque slightly</p>
<p>laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;You mock me, madame!&quot; cried Leoline, passionately.  &quot;You are</p>
<p>cruel - you are heartless!  If you know anything, in Heaven&#x27;s</p>
<p>name tell me - if not, go and leave me in peace!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you!  I shall do that presently; and as to the other - of</p>
<p>course I shall tell you; what else do you suppose I have come for</p>
<p>to-night?  Look here!  Do you see this?&quot;</p>
<p>She drew out from some hidden pocket in her dress a small and</p>
<p>beautifully-wrought casket of ivory and silver, with straps and</p>
<p>clasps of silver, and a tiny key of the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Well!&quot; asked Leoline, looking from it to her, with the blank air</p>
<p>of one utterly bewildered</p>
<p>&quot;In this casket, my dear, there is a roll of papers, closely</p>
<p>written, which you are to read as soon as I leave you.  Those</p>
<p>papers contain your whole history - do you understand?&quot;</p>
<p>She was looking so white, and staring so hard and so hopelessly,</p>
<p>that there was need of the question.  She took the casket and</p>
<p>gazed at it with a perplexed air.</p>
<p>&quot;My child, have your thoughts gone wool-gathering?  Do you not</p>
<p>comprehend what I have said to you!  Your whole history is hid in</p>
<p>that box?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know!&quot; said Leoline, slowly, and with her eyes again riveted</p>
<p>to the black mask.  &quot;But; madame, who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have I not told you?  What a pretty inquisitor it is!  I am La</p>
<p>Masque - your friend, now; something more soon, as you will see</p>
<p>when you read what I have spoken of.  Do not ask me how I have</p>
<p>come by it - you will read all about it there.  I did not know</p>
<p>that I would give it to you to-night, but I have a strange</p>
<p>foreboding that it is destined to be my last on earth.  And,</p>
<p>Leoline my child, before I leave you, let me hear you say you</p>
<p>will not hate me when you read what is there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What have you done to me?  Why should I hate you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! you will find that all out soon enough.  Do content me,</p>
<p>Leoline - let me hear you say; `La Masque, whatever you&#x27;ve done</p>
<p>to me, however you have wronged me, I will forgive you!&#x27;  Can you</p>
<p>say that?&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline repeated it simply, like a little child.  La Masque took</p>
<p>her hand, held it between both her own, leaned over and looked</p>
<p>earnestly in her face.</p>
<p>&quot;My little Leoline! my beautiful rosebud!  May Heaven bless you</p>
<p>and grant you a long and happy life with - shall I say it,</p>
<p>Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please - no!&quot; whispered Leoline, shyly.</p>
<p>La Masque softly patted the little tremulous hand.</p>
<p>&quot;We are both saying the name now in our hearts, my dear, so it is</p>
<p>little matter whether our lips repeat it or not.  He is worthy,</p>
<p>of you, Leoline, and your life will be a happy one by his side;</p>
<p>but there is another.&quot;  She paused and lowered her voice.  &quot; When</p>
<p>have you seen Count L&#x27;Estrange?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not since yesterday, madame.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Beware of him!  Do you know who he is, Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know nothing of him but his name.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then do not seek to know,&quot; said La Masque, emphatically.  &quot;For</p>
<p>it is a secret you would tremble to hear.  And now I must leave</p>
<p>you.  Come with me to the door, and fasten it as soon as I go</p>
<p>out, lest you should forget it altogether.&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline, with a dazed expression, thrust the precious little</p>
<p>casket into the bosom of her dress, and taking up the lamp,</p>
<p>preceded her visitor down stairs.  At the door they paused, and</p>
<p>La Masque, with her hand on her arm, repeated, in a low, earnest</p>
<p>voice</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline, beware of Count L&#x27;Estrange, and become Lady Kingsley as</p>
<p>soon as you can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will bear that name to-morrow!&quot; thought Leoline, with a glad</p>
<p>little thrill at her heart, as La Masque flitted out into the</p>
<p>moonlight.</p>
<p>Leoline closed and locked the door, driving the bolts into their</p>
<p>sockets, and making all secure. &quot;I defy any one to get in again</p>
<p>tonight!&quot; she said, smiling at her own dexterity; and lamp in</p>
<p>hand, she ran lightly up stairs to read the long unsolved riddle.</p>
<p>So eager was she, that she had crossed the room, laid the lamp on</p>
<p>the table, and sat down before it, ere she became aware that she</p>
<p>was not alone.  Some one was leaning against the mantel, his arm</p>
<p>on it, and his eyes do her, gazing with an air of incomparable</p>
<p>coolness and ease.  It was a man this time - something more than</p>
<p>a man,- a count, and Count L&#x27;Estrange, at that!</p>
<p>Leoline sprang to her feet with a wild scream, a cry full of</p>
<p>terror, amaze, and superstitious dread; and the count raised his</p>
<p>band with a self-possessed smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon, fair Leoline, if I intrude!  But have I not a right to</p>
<p>come at all hours and visit my bride?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline is no bride of yours!&quot; retorted that young lady,</p>
<p>passionately, her indignation overpowering both fear and</p>
<p>surprise.  &quot;And, what is more, never will be!  Now, sir!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So my little bird of paradise can fire up, I see!  As to your</p>
<p>being my bride, that remains to be seen.  You promised to be</p>
<p>tonight, you know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;ll recall that promise.  I have changed my mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that&#x27;s not very astonishing; it is but the privilege of</p>
<p>your sex!  Nevertheless, I&#x27;m afraid I must insist on your</p>
<p>becoming Countess L&#x27;Estrange, and that immediately!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never, sir!  I will die first!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no!  We could not spare such a bright little beauty out of</p>
<p>this ugly world!  You will live, and live for me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir!&quot; cried Leoline, white with passion, and her black eyes</p>
<p>blazing with a fire that would have killed him, could fiery</p>
<p>glances slay!  I do not know how you have entered here; but I do</p>
<p>know, if you are a gentleman, you will leave me instantly!  Go</p>
<p>sir!  I never wish to see you again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But when I wish to see you so much, my darling Leoline,&quot; said</p>
<p>the count, with provoking indifference, &quot;what does a little</p>
<p>reluctance on your part signify?  Get your hood and mantle, my</p>
<p>love - my horse awaits us without - and let us fly where neither</p>
<p>plague nor mortal man will interrupt our nuptials!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will no one take this man away?&quot; she cried, looking helplessly</p>
<p>round, and wringing her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly not, my dear - not even Sir Norman Kingsley!  George,</p>
<p>I am afraid this pretty little vixen will not go peaceably; you</p>
<p>had better come in!&quot;</p>
<p>With a smile on his face, he took a step toward her.  Shrieking</p>
<p>wildly, she darted across the room, and made for the door, just</p>
<p>as somebody else was entering it.  The next instant, a shawl was</p>
<p>thrown over her head, her cries smothered in it, and she was</p>
<p>lifted in a pair of strong arms, carried down stairs, and out</p>
<p>into the night.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
<p>THE THIRD VISION.</p>
<p>Presentments are strange things.  From the first moment Sir</p>
<p>Norman entered the city, and his thoughts had been able to leave</p>
<p>Miranda and find themselves wholly on Leoline, a heavy foreboding</p>
<p>of evil to her had oppressed him.  Some danger, he was sure, had</p>
<p>befallen her during his absence - how could it be otherwise with</p>
<p>the Earl of Rochester and Count L&#x27;Estrange both on her track?</p>
<p>Perhaps, by this time, one or other had found her, and alone and</p>
<p>unaided she had been an easy victim, and was now borne beyond his</p>
<p>reach forever.  The thought goaded him and his horse almost to</p>
<p>distraction; for the moment it struck him, he struck spurs into</p>
<p>his horse, making that unoffending animal jump spasmodically,</p>
<p>like one of those prancing steeds Miss Bonheur is fond of</p>
<p>depicting.  Through the streets</p>
<p>he flew at a frantic rate, growing more excited and full of</p>
<p>apprehension the nearer he came to old London Bridge; and calling</p>
<p>himself a select litany of hard names inwardly, for having left</p>
<p>the dear little thing at all.</p>
<p>&quot;If I find her safe and well,&quot; thought Sir Norman, emphatically,</p>
<p>&quot;nothing short of an earthquake or dying of the plague will ever</p>
<p>induce me to leave her again, until she is Lady Kingsley, and in</p>
<p>the old manor of Devonshire.  What a fool, idiot, and ninny I</p>
<p>must have been, to have left her as I did, knowing those two</p>
<p>sleuth-hounds were in full chase!  What are all the Mirandas and</p>
<p>midnight queens to me, if Leoline is lost?&quot;</p>
<p>That last question was addressed to the elements in general; and</p>
<p>as they disdained reply, he cantered on furiously, till the old</p>
<p>house by the river was reached.  It was the third time that night</p>
<p>he had paused to contemplate it, and each time with very</p>
<p>different feelings; first, from simple curiosity; second, in an</p>
<p>ecstasy of delight, and third and last, in an agony of</p>
<p>apprehension.  All around was peaceful and still; moon and stars</p>
<p>sailed serenely through a sky of silver and snow; a faint cool</p>
<p>breeze floated up from the river and fanned his hot and fevered</p>
<p>forehead; the whole city lay wrapped in stillness as profound and</p>
<p>deathlike as the fabled one of the marble prince in the Eastern</p>
<p>tale-nothing living moved abroad, but the lonely night-guard</p>
<p>keeping their dreary vigils before the plague-stricken houses,</p>
<p>and the ever-present, ever-busy pest-cart, with its mournful bell</p>
<p>and dreadful cry.</p>
<p>As far as Sir Norman could see, no other human being but himself</p>
<p>and the solitary watchman, so often mentioned, were visible.</p>
<p>Even he could scarcely be said to be present; for, though leaning</p>
<p>against the house with his halberd on his shoulder, he was sound</p>
<p>asleep at his post, and far away in the land of dreams.  It was</p>
<p>the second night of his watch; and with a good conscience and a</p>
<p>sound digestion, there is no earthly anguish short of the</p>
<p>toothache, strong enough to keep a man awake two nights in</p>
<p>succession.  So sound were his balmy slumbers in his airy</p>
<p>chamber, that not even the loud clatter of Sir Norman&#x27;s horse&#x27;s</p>
<p>hoofs proved strong enough to arouse him; and that young</p>
<p>gentleman, after glancing at him, made ap his mind to try to find</p>
<p>out for himself before arousing him to seek information.</p>
<p>Securing his home, he looked up at the house with wistful eyes,</p>
<p>and saw that the solitary light still burned in her chamber.  It</p>
<p>struck him now how very imprudent it was to keep that lamp</p>
<p>burning; for if Count L&#x27;Estrange saw it, it was all up with</p>
<p>Leoline - and there was even more to be dreaded from him than</p>
<p>from the earl.  How was he to find out whether that illuminated</p>
<p>chamber had a tenant or not?   Certainly, standing there staring</p>
<p>till doomsday would not do it; and there seemed but two ways,</p>
<p>that of entering the house at once or arousing the man.  But the</p>
<p>man was sleeping so soundly that it seemed a pity to awake him</p>
<p>for a trifle; and, after all, there could be no great harm or</p>
<p>indiscretion in his entering to see if his bride was safe.</p>
<p>Probably Leoline was asleep, and would know nothing about it; or,</p>
<p>even were she wide awake, and watchful, she was altogether too</p>
<p>sensible a girl to be displeased at his anxiety about her.  If</p>
<p>she were still awake, and waiting for day-dawn, he resolved to</p>
<p>remain with her and keep her from feeling lonesome until that</p>
<p>time came - if she were asleep, he would steal out softly again,</p>
<p>and keep guard at her door until morning.</p>
<p>Full of these praiseworthy resolutions, he tried the handle of</p>
<p>the door, half expecting to find it locked, and himself obliged</p>
<p>to effect an entrance through the window; but no, it yielded to</p>
<p>his touch, and he went in.  Hall and staircase were intensely</p>
<p>dark, but he knew his way without a pilot this time, and steered</p>
<p>clear of all shoals and quicksands, through the hall and up the</p>
<p>stairs.</p>
<p>The door of the lighted room - Leoline&#x27;s room - lay wide open,</p>
<p>and he paused on the threshold to reconnoitre.  He had gone</p>
<p>softly for fear of startling her, and now, with the same tender</p>
<p>caution, he glanced round the room.  The lamp burned on the</p>
<p>dainty dressing table, where undisturbed lay jewels, perfume</p>
<p>bottles and other knickknacks.  The cithern lay unmolested on the</p>
<p>couch, the rich curtains were drawn; everything was as he had</p>
<p>left it last - everything, but the pretty pink figure, with</p>
<p>drooping eyes, and pearls in the waves of her rich, black hair.</p>
<p>He looked round for the things she had worn, hoping she had taken</p>
<p>them off and retired to rest, but they were not to be seen; and</p>
<p>with a cold sinking of the heart, he went noiselessly across the</p>
<p>room, and to the bed.  It was empty, and showed no trace of</p>
<p>having been otherwise since he and the pest-cart driver had borne</p>
<p>from it the apparently lifeless form of Leoline.</p>
<p>Yes, she was gone; and Sir Norman turned for a moment so sick</p>
<p>with utter dread, that he leaned against one of the tall carved</p>
<p>posts, and hated himself for having left her with a heartlessness</p>
<p>that his worst enemy could not have surpassed.  Then aroused into</p>
<p>new and spasmodic energy by the exigency of the case, he seized</p>
<p>the lamp, and going out to the hall, made the house ring from</p>
<p>basement to attic with her name.  No reply, but that hollow,</p>
<p>melancholy echo that sounds so lugubriously through empty houses,</p>
<p>was returned; and he jumped down stairs with an impetuous rush,</p>
<p>flinging back every door in the hall below with a crash, and</p>
<p>flying wildly from room to room.  In solemn grim repose they lay;</p>
<p>but none of them held the bright figure in rose-satin he sought.</p>
<p>And he left them in despair, and went back to her chamber again.</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline! Leoline! Leoline!&quot; he called, while he rushed</p>
<p>impetuously ap stairs, and down stairs, and in my lady&#x27;s chamber;</p>
<p>but Leoline answered not - perhaps never would answer more!  Even</p>
<p>&quot;hoping against hope,&quot; he had to give up the chase at last - no</p>
<p>Leoline did that house hold; and with this conviction</p>
<p>despairingly impressed on leis mind, Sir Norman Kingsley covered</p>
<p>his face with his hands, and uttered a dismal groan.</p>
<p>Yet, forlorn as was the case, he groaned but once, &quot;only that and</p>
<p>nothing more;&quot; there was no time for such small luxuries as</p>
<p>groaning and tearing his hair, and boiling over with wrath and</p>
<p>vengeance against the human race generally, and those two</p>
<p>diabolical specimens of it, the Earl of Rochester and Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange, particularly.  He plunged head foremost down stairs,</p>
<p>and out of the door.  There he was impetuously brought up all</p>
<p>standing; for somebody stood before it, gazing up at the gloomy</p>
<p>front with as much earnestness as he had done himself, and</p>
<p>against this individual he rushed recklessly with a shock that</p>
<p>nearly sent the pair of them over into the street.</p>
<p>&quot;Sacr-r-re!&quot; cried a shrill voice, in tones of indignant</p>
<p>remonstrance.  &quot;What do you mean, monsieur?  Are you drunk, or</p>
<p>crazy, that you come running head foremost into peaceable</p>
<p>citizens, and throwing them heels uppermost on the king&#x27;s</p>
<p>highway!  Stand off, sir! And think yourself lucky that I don&#x27;t</p>
<p>run you through with my dirk for such an insult!&quot;</p>
<p>At the first sound of the outraged treble tones, Sir Norman had</p>
<p>started back and glared upon the speaker with much the same</p>
<p>expression of countenance as an incensed tiger.  The orator of</p>
<p>the spirited address had stooped to pick up his plumed cap, and</p>
<p>recover his centre of gravity, which was considerably knocked out</p>
<p>of place by the unexpected collision, and held forth with very</p>
<p>flashing eyes, and altogether too angry to recognize his auditor.</p>
<p>Sir Norman waited until he had done, and then springing at him,</p>
<p>grabbed him by the collar.</p>
<p>&quot;You young hound!&quot; he exclaimed, fairly lifting him off his feet</p>
<p>with one hand, and shaking him as if he would have wriggled him</p>
<p>out of hose and doublet.  &quot;You infernal young jackanapes! I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>run you through in less than two minutes, if you don&#x27;t tell me</p>
<p>where you have taken her.&quot;</p>
<p>The astonishment, not to say consternation, of Master Hubert for</p>
<p>that small young gentleman and no other it was - on thus having</p>
<p>his ideas thus shaken out of him, was unbounded, and held him</p>
<p>perfectly speechless, while Sir Norman glared at him and shook</p>
<p>him in a way that would have instantaneously killed him if his</p>
<p>looks were lightning.  The boy had recognized his aggressor, and</p>
<p>after his first galvanic shock, struggled like a little hero to</p>
<p>free himself, and at last succeeded by an artful spring.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley,&quot; he cried, keeping a safe yard or two of</p>
<p>pavement between him and that infuriated young knight, &quot;have you</p>
<p>gone mad, or what, is Heaven&#x27;s name, is the moaning of all this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It means,&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, drawing his sword, and</p>
<p>flourishing it within an inch of the boy&#x27;s curly head, - that</p>
<p>you&#x27;ll be a dead page in lees than half a minute, unless you tell</p>
<p>me immediately where she has been taken to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where who has been taken to?&quot; inquired Hubert, opening his</p>
<p>bright and indignant black eyes in a way that reminded Sir Norman</p>
<p>forcibly of Leoline.  &quot;Pardon, monsieur, I don&#x27;t understand at</p>
<p>all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You young villain!  Do you mean to stand up there and tell me to</p>
<p>my face that you have not searched for her, and found her, and</p>
<p>have carried her off?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, do you mean the lady we were talking of, that was saved</p>
<p>from the river?&quot; asked Hubert, a new light dawning upon him.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I mean the lady we were talking of?&quot; repeated Sir Norman,</p>
<p>with another furious flourish of his sword.  &quot;Yes, I do mean the</p>
<p>lady we were talking of; and what&#x27;s more - I mean to pin you</p>
<p>where you stand, against that wall, unless you tell me,</p>
<p>instantly, where she has been taken.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur!&quot; exclaimed the boy, raising his hands with an</p>
<p>earnestness there was no mistaking, &quot;I do assure you, upon my</p>
<p>honor, that I know nothing of the lady whatever; that I have not</p>
<p>found her; that I have never set eyes on her since the earl saved</p>
<p>her from the river.&quot;</p>
<p>The earnest tone of truth would, in itself, almost have convinced</p>
<p>Sir Norman, but it was not that, that made him drop his sword so</p>
<p>suddenly.  The pale, startled face; the dark, solemn eyes, were</p>
<p>so exactly like Leoline&#x27;s, that they thrilled him through and</p>
<p>through, and almost made him believe, for a moment, he was</p>
<p>talking to Leoline herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you - are you sure you are not Leoline?&quot; he inquired, almost</p>
<p>convinced, for an instant, by the marvelous resemblance, that it</p>
<p>was really so.</p>
<p>&quot;I?  Positively, Sir Norman, I cannot understand this at all,</p>
<p>unless you wish to enjoy yourself at my expense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, Master Hubert!&quot; said Sir Norman with a sudden change</p>
<p>of look and tone.  &quot;If you do not understand, I shall just tell</p>
<p>you in a word or two how matters are, and then let me hear you</p>
<p>clear yourself.  You know the lady we were talking about, that</p>
<p>Lord Rochester picked up afloat, and sent you in search of?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes - yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; went on Sir Norman, with a sort of grim stoicism.  &quot;After</p>
<p>leaving you, I started on a little expedition of my own, two</p>
<p>miles from the city, from which expedition I returned ten minutes</p>
<p>ago.  When I left, the lady was secure and safe in this house;</p>
<p>when I came back, she was gone.  You were in search of her - had</p>
<p>told me yourself you were determined on finding her, and having</p>
<p>her carried off; and now, my youthful friend, put this and that</p>
<p>together,&quot; with a momentary returning glare, &quot;and see what it</p>
<p>amounts to!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It amounts to this:&quot; retorted his youthful friend, stoutly,</p>
<p>&quot;that I know nothing whatever about it.  You may make out a case</p>
<p>of strong circumstantial evidence against me; but if the lady has</p>
<p>been carried off, I have had no hand in it.&quot;</p>
<p>Again Sir Norman was staggered by the frank, bold gaze and</p>
<p>truthful voice, but still the string was in a tangle somewhere.</p>
<p>&quot;And where have you been ever since?&quot; he began severely, and with</p>
<p>the air of a lawyer about to go into a rigid cross-examination.</p>
<p>&quot;Searching for her,&quot; was the prompt reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Through the streets; in the pest-houses, and at the plague-pit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How did you find out she lived here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not find it out.  When I became convinced she was in none</p>
<p>of the places I have mentioned, I gave up the search in despair,</p>
<p>for to-night, and was returning to his lordship to report my ill</p>
<p>success.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, then, were you standing in front of her house, gaping at it</p>
<p>with all the eyes in your head, as if it were the eighth wonder</p>
<p>of the world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur has not the most courteous way of asking questions,</p>
<p>that I ever heard of; but I have no particular objection to</p>
<p>answer him.  It struck me that, as Mr. Ormiston brought the lady</p>
<p>up this way, and as I saw you and he haunting this place so much</p>
<p>to-night, I thought her residence was somewhere here, and I</p>
<p>paused to look at the house as I went along.  In fact, I intended</p>
<p>to ask old sleepy-head, over there, for further particulars,</p>
<p>before I left the neighborhood, had not you, Sir Norman, run bolt</p>
<p>into me, and knocked every idea clean out of my head.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you are sure you are not Leoline?&quot; said Sir Norman,</p>
<p>suspiciously.</p>
<p>&quot;To the best of my belief, Sir Norman, I am not,&quot; replied Hubert,</p>
<p>reflectively.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it is all very strange, and very aggravating,&quot; said Sir</p>
<p>Norman sighing ,and sheathing his sword.  &quot;She is gone, at all</p>
<p>events; no doubt about that - and if you have not carried her</p>
<p>off, somebody else has.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps she has gone herself,&quot; insinuated Hubert.</p>
<p>&quot;Bah! Gone herself!&quot; said Sir Norman, scornfully.  &quot;The idea is</p>
<p>beneath contempt:  I tell you, Master Fine-feathers, the lady and</p>
<p>I were to be married bright and early to-morrow morning, and</p>
<p>leave this disgusting city for Devonshire.  Do you suppose, then,</p>
<p>she would run out in the small hours of the morning, and go</p>
<p>prancing about the streets, or eloping with herself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, of course, Sir Norman, I can&#x27;t take it upon myself to</p>
<p>answer positively; but, to use the mildest phrase, I must say the</p>
<p>lady seems decidedly eccentric, and capable of doing very queer</p>
<p>things.  I hope, however, you believe me; for I earnestly assure</p>
<p>you, I never laid eyes on her but that once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe you,&quot; said Sir Norman, with another profound and</p>
<p>broken-hearted sigh, &quot;and I&#x27;m only too sure she has been abducted</p>
<p>by that consummate scoundrel and treacherous villain, Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Count who?&quot; said Hubert, with a quick start, and a look of</p>
<p>intense curiosity.  &quot;What was the name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;L&#x27;Estrange - a scoundrel of the deepest dye!  Perhaps you know</p>
<p>him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Hubert, with a queer, half musing smile, &quot;no; but I</p>
<p>have a notion I have heard the name.  Was he a rival of yours?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should think so!  He was to have been married to the lady this</p>
<p>very night!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was, eh!  And what prevented the ceremony?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She took the plague!&quot; said Sir Norman, strange to say, not at</p>
<p>all offended at the boy&#x27;s familiarity.  &quot;And would have been</p>
<p>thrown into the plague-pit but for me.  And when she recovered</p>
<p>she accepted me and cast him off!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A quick exchange!  The lady&#x27;s heart must be most flexible, or</p>
<p>unusually large, to be able to hold so many at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It never held him!&quot; said Sir Norman, frowning; &quot;she was forced</p>
<p>into the marriage by her mercenary friends.  Oh! if I had him</p>
<p>here, wouldn&#x27;t I make him wish the highwaymen had shot him</p>
<p>through the head, and done for him, before I would let him go!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is he like - this Count L&#x27;Estrange?&quot; said Hubert,</p>
<p>carelessly.</p>
<p>&quot;Like the black-hearted traitor and villain he is!&quot; replied Sir</p>
<p>Norman, with more energy than truth; for he had caught but</p>
<p>passing glimpses of the count&#x27;s features, and those showed him</p>
<p>they were decidedly prepossessing; &quot;and he slinks along like a</p>
<p>coward and an abductor as he is, in a slouched hat and shadowy</p>
<p>cloak.  Oh! if I had him here!&quot; repeated Sir Norman, with</p>
<p>vivacity; &quot;wouldn&#x27;t I - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, of course you would,&quot; interposed Hubert, &quot;and serve him</p>
<p>right, too!  Have you made any inquiries about the matter - for</p>
<p>instance, of our friend sleeping the sleep of the just, across</p>
<p>there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No - why?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, it seems to me, if she&#x27;s been carried off before he fell</p>
<p>asleep, he has probably heard or seen something of it; and I</p>
<p>think it would not be a bad plan to step over and inquire.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we can try,&quot; said Sir Norman, with a despairing face; &quot;but</p>
<p>I know it will end in disappointment and vexation of spirit, like</p>
<p>all the rest!&quot;</p>
<p>With which dismal view of things, he crossed the street side by</p>
<p>side with his jaunty young friend.  The watchman was still</p>
<p>enjoying the balmy, and snoring in short, sharp snorts, when</p>
<p>Master Hubert remorselessly caught him by the shoulder, and began</p>
<p>a series of shakes and pokes, and digs, and hallos!&quot; while Sir</p>
<p>Norman stood near and contemplated the scene with a pensive eye.</p>
<p>At last while undergoing a severe course of this treatment the</p>
<p>watchman was induced to open his eyes on this mortal life, and</p>
<p>transfix the two beholders with, an intensely vacant and blank</p>
<p>share.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey?&quot; he inquired, helplessly.  &quot;What was you a saying of,</p>
<p>gentlemen?  What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We weren&#x27;t a saying of anything as yet &quot; returned Hubert; &quot;but</p>
<p>we mean to, shortly.  Are you quite sure you are wide awake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; was the cross question, given by way of</p>
<p>answer.  &quot;What do you come bothering me for at such a rate, all</p>
<p>night, I want to know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Keep civil, friend, we wear swords,&quot; said Hubert, touching, with</p>
<p>dignity, the hilt of the little dagger he carried; &quot;we only want</p>
<p>to ask you a few questions.  First, do you see that house over</p>
<p>yonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!  I see it!&quot; said the man gruffly; &quot;I am not blind!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well who was the last person you saw come out of that house?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know who they was!&quot; still more gruffly.  &quot;I ain&#x27;t got</p>
<p>the pleasure of their acquaintance!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you see a young lady come out of it lately?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did I see a young lady?&quot; burst out the watchman, in a high key</p>
<p>of aggrieved expostulation.  &quot;How many more times this blessed</p>
<p>night am I to be asked about that young lady.  First and</p>
<p>foremost, there comes two young men, which this here is one of</p>
<p>them, and they bring out the young lady and have her hauled away</p>
<p>in the dead-cart; then comes along another and wants to know all</p>
<p>the particulars, and by the time he gets properly away, somebody</p>
<p>else comes and brings her back like a drowned rat.  Then all</p>
<p>sorts of people goes in and out, and I get tired looking at them,</p>
<p>and then fall asleep, and before I&#x27;ve been in that condition</p>
<p>about a minute, you two come punching me and waken me up to ask</p>
<p>questions about her!  I wish that young lady was in Jerico - I</p>
<p>do!&quot; said the watchman, with a smothered growl.</p>
<p>&quot;Come, come, my man!&quot; said Hubert, slapping him soothingly on the</p>
<p>shoulder. &quot;Don&#x27;t be savage, if you can help it!  This gentleman</p>
<p>has a gold coin in some of his pockets, I believe, and it will</p>
<p>fall to you if you keep quiet and answer decently.  Tell me how</p>
<p>many have been in that house since the young lady was brought</p>
<p>back like a drowned rat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How many?&quot; said the man, meditating, with his eyes fixed on Sir</p>
<p>Norman&#x27;s garments, and he, perceiving that, immediately gave him</p>
<p>the promised coin to refresh his memory, which it did with</p>
<p>amazing quickness.  &quot;How many - oh - let me see; there was the</p>
<p>young man that brought her in, and left her there, and came out</p>
<p>again, and went away.  By-and-by, he came back with another,</p>
<p>which I think this as gave me the money is him.  After a little,</p>
<p>they came out, first the other one, then this one, and went off;</p>
<p>and the next that went in was a tall woman in black, with a mask</p>
<p>on, and right behind her there came two men; the woman in the</p>
<p>mask came out after a while; and about ten minutes after, the two</p>
<p>men followed, and one of them carried something in his arms, that</p>
<p>didn&#x27;t look unlike a lady with her head in a shawl.  Anything</p>
<p>wrong, sir?&quot; as Sir Norman gave a violent start and caught Hubert</p>
<p>by the arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing!  Where did they carry her to?  What did they do with</p>
<p>her?  Go on! go on!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the watchman, eyeing the speaker curiously, &quot;I&#x27;m</p>
<p>going to.  They went along, down to the river, both of them, and</p>
<p>I saw a boat shove off, shortly after, and that something, with</p>
<p>its head in a shawl, lying as peaceable as a lamb, with one of</p>
<p>the two beside it.  That&#x27;s all - I went asleep about then, till</p>
<p>you two were shaking me and waking me up.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman and Hubert looked at each other, one between despair</p>
<p>and rage, the other with s thoughtful, half-inquiring air, as if</p>
<p>he had some secret to tell, and was mentally questioning whether</p>
<p>it was safe to do so.  On the whole, he seemed to come to the</p>
<p>conclusion, that a silent tongue maketh a wise head, and nodding</p>
<p>and saying &quot;Thank you!&quot; to the watchman, he passed his arm</p>
<p>through Sir Norman&#x27;s, and drew him back to the door of Leoline&#x27;s</p>
<p>house.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a light within,&quot; he said, looking up at it; &quot;how comes</p>
<p>that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I found the lamp burning, when I returned, and everything</p>
<p>undisturbed.  They must have entered noiselessly, and carried her</p>
<p>off without a straggle,&quot; replied Sir Norman, with a sort of</p>
<p>groan,</p>
<p>&quot;Have you searched the house - searched it well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thoroughly - from top to bottom!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to me there ought to be some trace.  Will you come back</p>
<p>with me and look again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is no use; but there in nothing else I can do; so come</p>
<p>along!&quot;</p>
<p>They entered the house, and Sir Norman led the page direct to</p>
<p>Leoline&#x27;s room, where the light was.</p>
<p>&quot;I left her here when I went away, and here the lamp was burning</p>
<p>when I came back:  so it must have been from this room she was</p>
<p>taken.&quot;</p>
<p>Hubert was gazing slowly and critically round, taking note of</p>
<p>everything.  Something glistened and flashed on the floor, under</p>
<p>the mantel, and he went over and picked it up.</p>
<p>&quot;What have you there?&quot; asked Sir Norman in surprise; for the boy</p>
<p>had started so suddenly, and flushed so violently, that it might</p>
<p>have astonished any one.</p>
<p>&quot;Only a shoe-buckle - a gentleman&#x27;s - do you recognize it?&quot;</p>
<p>Though he spoke in his usual careless way, and half-hummed the</p>
<p>air of one of Lord Rochester&#x27;s love songs, he watched him keenly</p>
<p>as he examined it.  It was a diamond buckle, exquisitely set, and</p>
<p>of great beauty and value; but Sir Norman knew nothing of it.</p>
<p>&quot;There are initials upon it -see there!&quot; said Hubert, pointing,</p>
<p>and still watching him with the same powerful glance.  &quot;The</p>
<p>letters C.  S.  That can&#x27;t stand for Count L&#x27;Estrange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who then can it stand for?&quot; inquired Sir Norman, looking at him</p>
<p>fixedly, and with far more penetration than the court page had</p>
<p>given him credit for.  &quot;I am certain you know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect!&quot; said the boy, emphatically, &quot;nothing more; and if it</p>
<p>is as I believe, I will bring you news of Leoline before you are</p>
<p>two hours older.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How am I to know you are not deceiving me, and will not betray</p>
<p>her into the power of the Earl of Rochester - if, indeed, she be</p>
<p>not in his power already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is not in it, and never will be through me!  I feel an odd</p>
<p>interest in this matter, and I will be true to you, Sir Norman -</p>
<p>though why I should be, I really don&#x27;t know.  I give you my word</p>
<p>of honor that I will do what I can to find Leoline and restore</p>
<p>her to you; and I have never yet broken my word of honor to any</p>
<p>man,&quot; said Hubert, drawing himself up.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I will trust you, because I cannot do anything better,&quot;</p>
<p>said Sir Norman, rather dolefully; &quot;but why not let me go with</p>
<p>you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no! that would never do!  I must go alone, and you must</p>
<p>trust me implicitly.  Give me your hand upon it.&quot;</p>
<p>They shook hands silently, went down stairs, and stood for a</p>
<p>moment at the door.</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll find me here at any hour between this and morning,&quot; said</p>
<p>Sir Norman.  &quot;Farewell now, and Heaven speed you!&quot;</p>
<p>The boy waved his hand in adieu, and started off at a sharp pace.</p>
<p>Sir Norman turned in the opposite direction for a short walk, to</p>
<p>cool the fever in his blood, and think over all that had</p>
<p>happened.  As be went slowly along, in the shadow of the houses,</p>
<p>he suddenly tripped up over something lying in his path, and was</p>
<p>nearly precipitated over it.</p>
<p>Stooping down to examine the stumbling-block, it proved to be the</p>
<p>rigid body of a man, and that man was Ormiston, stark and dead,</p>
<p>with his face upturned to the calm night-sky.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII</p>
<p>THE HIDDEN FACE</p>
<p>When Mr. Malcolm Ormiston, with his usual good sense and</p>
<p>penetration, took himself off, and left Leoline and Sir Norman</p>
<p>tete-a-tete, his steps turned as mechanically as the needle to</p>
<p>the North Pole toward La Masque&#x27;s house.  Before it he wandered,</p>
<p>around it he wandered, like an uneasy ghost, lost in speculation</p>
<p>about the hidden face, and fearfully impatient about the flight</p>
<p>of time.  If La Masque saw him hovering aloof and unable to tear</p>
<p>himself away, perhaps it might touch her obdurate heart, and</p>
<p>cause her to shorten the dreary interval, and summon him to her</p>
<p>presence at once.  Just then some one opened the door, and his</p>
<p>heart began to beat with anticipation; some one pronounced his</p>
<p>name, and, going over, he saw the animated bag of bones -</p>
<p>otherwise his lady-love&#x27;s vassal and porter.</p>
<p>&quot;La Masque says,&quot; began the attenuated lackey, and Ormiston&#x27;s</p>
<p>heart nearly jumped out of his mouth, &quot;that she can&#x27;t have</p>
<p>anybody hanging about her house like its shadow; and she wants</p>
<p>you to go away, and keep away, till the time comes she has</p>
<p>mentioned.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying the skeleton shut the door, and Ormiston&#x27;s heart went</p>
<p>down to zero.  There being nothing for it but obedience, however,</p>
<p>he slowly and reluctantly turned away, feeling in his bones, that</p>
<p>if ever he came to the bliss and ecstasy of calling La Masque</p>
<p>Mrs.  Ormiston, the gray mare in his stable would be by long odds</p>
<p>the better horse.  Unintentionally his steps turned to the</p>
<p>water-side, and he descended the flight of stairs, determined to</p>
<p>get into a boat and watch the illumination from the river.</p>
<p>Late as was the hour, the Thames seemed alive with wherries and</p>
<p>barges, and their numerous lights danced along the surface like</p>
<p>fire-flies over a marsh.  A gay barge, gilded and cushioned, was</p>
<p>going slowly past; and as he stood directly under the lamp, he</p>
<p>was recognized by a gentleman within it, who leaned over and</p>
<p>hailed him</p>
<p>&quot;Ormiston! I say, Ormiston!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, my lord,&quot; said Ormiston, recognizing the handsome face and</p>
<p>animated voice of the Earl of Rochester.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you any engagement for the next half-hour?  If not, do me</p>
<p>the favor to take a seat here, and watch London in flames from</p>
<p>the river.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With all my heart,&quot; said Ormiston, running down to the water&#x27;s</p>
<p>edge, and leaping into the boat.  &quot;With all this bustle of life</p>
<p>around here, one would think it were noonday instead of</p>
<p>midnight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The whole city is astir about these fires.  Have you any idea</p>
<p>they will be successful?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not the least.  You know, my lord, the prediction runs, that the</p>
<p>plague will rage till the living are no longer able to bury the</p>
<p>dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will soon come to that,&quot; said the earl shuddering slightly,</p>
<p>&quot;if it continues increasing much longer as it does now daily.</p>
<p>How do the bills of mortality ran to-day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have not heard.  Hark!  There goes St. Paul&#x27;s tolling twelve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And there goes a flash of fire - the first among many.  Look,</p>
<p>look!  How they spring up into the black darkness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They will not do it long.  Look at the sky, my lord.&quot;</p>
<p>The earl glanced up at the midnight sky, of a dull and dingy red</p>
<p>color, except where black and heavy clouds were heaving like</p>
<p>angry billows, all dingy with smoke and streaked with bars of</p>
<p>fiery red.</p>
<p>&quot;I see!  There is a storm coming, and a heavy one! Our worthy</p>
<p>burghers and most worshipful Lord Mayor will see their fires</p>
<p>extinguished shortly, and themselves sent home with wet jackets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And for weeks, almost month, there has not fallen a drop of</p>
<p>rain,&quot; remarked Ormiston, gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;A remarkable coincidence, truly.  There seems to be a fatality</p>
<p>hanging over this devoted city.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder your lordship remains?&quot;</p>
<p>The earl shrugged his shoulders significantly.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not so easy leaving it as you think, Mr. Ormiston; but I</p>
<p>am to turn my back to it to-morrow for a brief period.  You are</p>
<p>aware, I suppose, that the court leaves before daybreak for</p>
<p>Oxford.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe I have heard something of it - how long to remain?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Till Charles takes it into his head to come back again,&quot; said</p>
<p>the earl, familiarly, &quot;which will probably be in a week or two.</p>
<p>Look at that sky, all black and scarlet; and look at those people</p>
<ul>
<li>I scarcely thought there were half the number left alive in</li>
</ul>
<p>London.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even the sick have come out to-night,&quot; said Ormiston.  &quot;Half the</p>
<p>pest-stricken in the city have left their beds, full of newborn</p>
<p>hope.  One would think it were a carnival.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So it is - a carnival of death!  I hope, Ormiston,&quot; said the</p>
<p>earl, looking at him with a light laugh, &quot;the pretty little white</p>
<p>fairy we rescued from the river is not one of the sick parading</p>
<p>the streets.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston looked grave.</p>
<p>&quot;No, my lord, I think she is not.  I left her safe and secure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is she, Ormiston?&quot; coaxed the earl, laughingly.  &quot;Pshaw,</p>
<p>man! don&#x27;t make a mountain out of a mole-hill!  Tell me her</p>
<p>name!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her name is Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is just what I would like to have some one tell me.  I give</p>
<p>you my honor, my lord, I do not know.&quot;</p>
<p>The earl&#x27;s face, half indignant, half incredulous, wholly</p>
<p>curious, made Ormiston smile.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a fact, my lord.  I asked her her name, and she told me</p>
<p>Leoline - a pretty title enough, but rather unsatisfactory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How long have you known her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To the best of my belief,&quot; said Ormiston, musingly, &quot;about four</p>
<p>hours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; cried the earl, energetically.  &quot;What are you telling</p>
<p>me, Ormiston?  You said she was an old friend.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, my lord, I said no such thing.  I told you</p>
<p>she had escaped from her friends, which was strictly true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then how the demon had you the impudence to come up and carry</p>
<p>her off in that style?  I certainly had a better right to her</p>
<p>than you - the right of discovery; and I shall call upon you to</p>
<p>deliver her up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If she belonged to me I should only be too happy to oblige your</p>
<p>lordship,&quot; laughed Ormiston; &quot;but she is at present the property</p>
<p>of Sir Norman Kingsley, and to him you must apply.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!  His inamorata, in she?  Well, I must say his taste is</p>
<p>excellent; but I should think you ought to know her name, since</p>
<p>you and he are noted for being a modern Damon and Pythias.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably I should, my lord, only Sir Norman, unfortunately, does</p>
<p>not know himself.&quot;</p>
<p>The earl&#x27;s countenance looked so utterly blank at this</p>
<p>announcement, that Ormiston was forced to throw in a word of</p>
<p>explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;I mean to say, my lord, that he has fallen in love with her;</p>
<p>and, judging from appearances, I should say his flame is not</p>
<p>altogether hopeless, although they have met to-night for the</p>
<p>first time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A rapid passion.  Where have you left her, Ormiston?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In her own house, my lord,&quot; Ormiston replied, smiling quietly to</p>
<p>himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About a dozen yards from where I stood when you called me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are her family?&quot; continued the earl, who seemed possessed of</p>
<p>a devouring curiosity.</p>
<p>&quot;She has none that I know of.  I imagine Mistress Leoline is an</p>
<p>orphan.  I know there was not a living soul but ourselves in the</p>
<p>house I brought her to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you left her there alone?&quot; exclaimed the earl, half starting</p>
<p>up, an if about to order the boatman to row back to the landing.</p>
<p>Ormiston looked at his excited face with a glance full of quiet</p>
<p>malice.</p>
<p>&quot;No, my lord, not quits; Sir Norman Kingsley was with her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said the earl, smiling back with a look of chagrin.  &quot;Then</p>
<p>he will probably find out her name before he comes away.  I</p>
<p>wonder you could give her up so easily to him, after all your</p>
<p>trouble!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Smitten, my lord?&quot; inquired Ormiston, maliciously.</p>
<p>&quot;Hopelessly!&quot; replied the earl, with a deep sigh.  &quot;She was a</p>
<p>perfect little beauty; and if I can find her, I warn Sir Norman</p>
<p>Kingsley to take care!  I have already sent Hubert out in search</p>
<p>of her; and, by the way,&quot; said the earl, with a sudden increase</p>
<p>of animation, &quot;what a wonderful resemblance she bears to Hubert -</p>
<p>I could almost swear they were one and the same!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The likeness is marvelous; but I should hate to take such an</p>
<p>oath.  I confess I am somewhat curious myself; but I stand no</p>
<p>chance of having it gratified before to-morrow, I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How those fires blaze!  It is much brighter than at noon-day.</p>
<p>Show me the house in which Leoline lies?&quot;.</p>
<p>Ormiston easily pointed it out, and showed the earl the light</p>
<p>still burning in her window.</p>
<p>&quot;It was in that room we found her first, dead of the plague!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead of the what?&quot; cried the earl, aghast.</p>
<p>&quot;Dead of the plague!  I&#x27;ll tell your lordship how it was,&quot; said</p>
<p>Ormiston, who forthwith commend and related the story of their</p>
<p>finding Leoline; of the resuscitation at the plague-pit; of the</p>
<p>flight from Sir Norman&#x27;s house, and of the delirious plunge into</p>
<p>the river, and miraculous cure.</p>
<p>&quot;A marvelous story,&quot; commented the earl, much interested.  &quot;And</p>
<p>Leoline seems to have as many lives as a cat!  Who can she be - a</p>
<p>princess in disguise - eh, Ormiston?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She looks fit to be a princess, or anything else; but your</p>
<p>lordship knows as much about her, now, as I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You say she was dressed as a bride - how came that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Simply enough.  She was to be married to-night, had she not</p>
<p>taken the plague instead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Married?  Why, I thought you told me a few minutes ago she was</p>
<p>in love with Kingsley.  It seems to me, Mr. Ormiston, your</p>
<p>remarks are a trifle inconsistent,&quot; said the earl, in a tone of</p>
<p>astonished displeasure.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, they are all perfectly true.  Mistress Leoline was</p>
<p>to be married, as I told you; but she was to marry to please her</p>
<p>friends, and not herself.  She had been in the habit of watching</p>
<p>Kingsley go past her window; and the way she blushed, and went</p>
<p>through the other little motions, convinces me that his course of</p>
<p>true love will ran as smooth as this glassy river runs at</p>
<p>present.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kingsley is a lucky fellow.  Will the discarded suitor have no</p>
<p>voice in the matter; or is he such a simpleton as to give her up</p>
<p>at a word?&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! to be sure; what will the count say?  And, judging from some</p>
<p>things I&#x27;ve heard, I should say he is violently in love with</p>
<p>her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Count who?&quot; asked Rochester.  &quot;Or has he, like his ladylove, no</p>
<p>other name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no!  The name of the gentleman who was so nearly blessed for</p>
<p>life, and missed it, is Count L&#x27;Estrange!&quot;</p>
<p>The earl had been lying listlessly back, only half intent upon</p>
<p>his answer, as he watched the fire; but now he sprang sharply up,</p>
<p>and stared Ormiston full in the face.</p>
<p>&quot;Count what did you say?&quot; was his eager question, while his eyes,</p>
<p>more eager than his voice, strove to read the reply before it was</p>
<p>repeated.</p>
<p>&quot;Count L&#x27;Estrange.  You know him, my lord?&quot; said Ormiston,</p>
<p>quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the earl.  And then such a strange meaning smile went</p>
<p>wandering about his face.  &quot;I have not said that!  So his name is</p>
<p>Count L&#x27;Estrange?  Well, I don&#x27;t wonder now at the girl&#x27;s</p>
<p>beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>The earl sank back to his former nonchalant position and fell for</p>
<p>a moment or two into deep musing; and then, as if the whole thing</p>
<p>struck him in a new and ludicrous light, he broke out into an</p>
<p>immoderate fit of laughter.  Ormiston looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my turn to ask questions, now, my lord.  Who is Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know of no such person, Ormiston.  I was thinking of something</p>
<p>else!  Was it Leoline who told you that was her lover&#x27;s name?&quot;</p>
<p>No; I heard it by mere accident from another person.  I am sure,</p>
<p>if Leoline is not a personage in disguise, he is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And why do you think so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An inward conviction, my lord.  So you will not tell me who he</p>
<p>is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have I not told you I know of no such person as Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange?   You ought to believe me.  Oh, here it comes.&quot;</p>
<p>This last was addressed to a great drop of rain, which splashed</p>
<p>heavily on his upturned face, followed by another and another in</p>
<p>quick succession.</p>
<p>&quot;The storm is upon us,&quot; said the earl, sitting up and wrapping</p>
<p>his cloak closer around him, &quot;and I am for Whitehall.  Shall we</p>
<p>land you, Ormiston, or take you there, too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must land,&quot; said Ormiston.  &quot;I have a pressing engagement for</p>
<p>the next half-hour.  Here it is, in a perfect deluge; the fires</p>
<p>will be out in five minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>The barge touched the stairs, and Ormiston sprang out, with</p>
<p>&quot;Good-night&quot; to the earl.  The rain was rushing along, now, in</p>
<p>torrents, and he ran upstairs and darted into an archway of the</p>
<p>bridge, to seek the shelter.  Some one else had come there before</p>
<p>him, in search of the same thing; for he saw two dark figures</p>
<p>standing within it as he entered.</p>
<p>&quot;A sudden storm,&quot; was Ormiston&#x27;s salutation, &quot;and a furious one.</p>
<p>There go the fires - hiss and splutter.  I knew how it would be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then Saul and Mr. Ormiston are among the prophets?&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston had heard that voice before; it was associated in his</p>
<p>mind with a slouched hat and shadowy cloak; and by the fast-</p>
<p>fading flicker of the firelight, he saw that both were here.  The</p>
<p>speaker wan Count L&#x27;Estrange; the figure beside him, slender and</p>
<p>boyish, was unknown.</p>
<p>&quot;You have the advantage of me, sir,&quot; he said affecting ignorance.</p>
<p>&quot;May I ask who you are?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly.  A gentlemen, by courtesy and the grace of God.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And your name?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Count L&#x27;Estrange, at your service.&quot;</p>
<p>Ormiston lifted his cap and bowed, with a feeling somehow, that</p>
<p>the count was a man in authority.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Ormiston assisted in doing a good deed, tonight, for a</p>
<p>friend of mine,&quot; said the count.</p>
<p>&quot;Will he add to that obligation by telling me if he has not</p>
<p>discovered her again, and brought her back?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you refer to the fair lady in yonder house?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So she is there?  I thought so, George,&quot; said the count,</p>
<p>addressing himself to his companion.  &quot;Yes, I refer to her, the</p>
<p>lady you saved from the river.  You brought her there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I brought her there,&quot; replied Ormiston.</p>
<p>&quot;She is there still?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I presume so.  I have heard nothing to the contrary &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And alone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She may be, now.  Sir Norman Kingsley was with her when I left</p>
<p>her,&quot; said Ormiston, administering the fact with infinite relish.</p>
<p>There was a moment&#x27;s silence.  Ormiston could not see the count&#x27;s</p>
<p>face; but, judging from his own feelings, he fancied its</p>
<p>expression must be sweet.  The wild rush of the storm alone broke</p>
<p>the silence, until the spirit again moved the count to speak.</p>
<p>&quot;By what right does Sir Norman Kingsley visit her?&quot; he inquired,</p>
<p>in a voice betokening not the least particle of emotion.</p>
<p>&quot;By the best of rights - that of her preserver, hoping soon to be</p>
<p>her lover.&quot;</p>
<p>There was an other brief silence, broken again by the count, in</p>
<p>the same composed tone:</p>
<p>&quot;Since the lady holds her levee so late, I, too, must have a word</p>
<p>with her, when this deluge permits one to go abroad without</p>
<p>danger of drowning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It shown symptoms of clearing off, already,&quot; said Ormiston, who,</p>
<p>in his secret heart, thought it would be an excellent joke to</p>
<p>bring the rivals face to face in the lady&#x27;s presence; &quot;so you</p>
<p>will not have long to wait.&quot;</p>
<p>To which observation the count replied not; and the three stood</p>
<p>in silence, watching the fury of the storm.</p>
<p>Gradually it cleared away; and as the moon began to straggle out</p>
<p>between the rifts in the clouds, the count saw something by her</p>
<p>pale light that Ormiston saw not.  That latter gentleman,</p>
<p>standing with his back to the house of Leoline, and his face</p>
<p>toward that of Ls Masque, did not observe the return of Sir</p>
<p>Norman from St. Paul&#x27;s, nor look after him as he rode away.  But</p>
<p>the count did both; and ten minutes after, when the rain had</p>
<p>entirely ceased, and the moon and stars got the better of the</p>
<p>clouds in their struggle for supremacy, he beheld La Masque</p>
<p>flitting like a dark shadow in the same direction, and vanishing</p>
<p>in at Leoline&#x27;s door.  The same instant, Ormiston started to go.</p>
<p>&quot;The storm has entirely ceased,&quot; he said, stepping out, and with</p>
<p>the profound air of one making a new discovery, &quot;and we are</p>
<p>likely to have fine weather for the remainder of the night - or</p>
<p>rather, morning.  Good night, count.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Farewell,&quot; said the count, as he and, his companion came out</p>
<p>from the shadow of the archway, and turned to follow La Masque.</p>
<p>Ormiston, thinking the hour of waiting had elapsed, and feeling</p>
<p>much more interested in the coming meeting than in Leoline or her</p>
<p>visitors, paid very little attention to his two acquaintances.</p>
<p>He saw them, it is true, enter Leoline&#x27;s house, but at the same</p>
<p>instant, he took up his post at La Masque&#x27;s doorway, and</p>
<p>concentrated his whole attention on that piece of architecture.</p>
<p>Every moment seemed like a week now; and before he had stood at</p>
<p>his post five minutes, he had worked himself up into a perfect</p>
<p>fever of impatience.  Sometimes he was inclined to knock and seek</p>
<p>La Masque in her own home; but as often the fear of a chilling</p>
<p>rebuke paralyzed his hand when he raised it.  He was so sure she</p>
<p>was within the house, that he never thought of looking for her</p>
<p>elsewhere; and when, at the expiration of what seemed to him a</p>
<p>century or two, but which in reality was about a quarter of an</p>
<p>hour, there was a soft rustling of drapery behind him, and the</p>
<p>sweetest of voices sounded in his ear, it fairly made him bound.</p>
<p>&quot;Here again, Mr. Ormiston?  Is this the fifth or sixth time I&#x27;ve</p>
<p>found you in this place to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;La Masque!&quot; he cried, between joy and surprise.  &quot;But surely, I</p>
<p>was not totally unexpected this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps not.  You are waiting here for me to redeem my promise,</p>
<p>I suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you doubt it?  Since I knew you first, I have desired this</p>
<p>hour as the blind desire sight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!  And you will find it as sweet to look back upon as you have</p>
<p>to look forward to,&quot; said La Masque, derisively.  &quot;If you are</p>
<p>wise for yourself, Mr. Ormiston, you will pause here, and give me</p>
<p>back that fatal word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never, madame!  And surely you will not be so pitilessly cruel</p>
<p>as to draw back, now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I have promised, and I shall perform; and let the</p>
<p>consequences be what they may, they will rest upon your own head.</p>
<p>You have been warned, and you still insist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I still insist!&quot;</p>
<p>Then let us move farther over here into the shadow of the houses;</p>
<p>this moonlight is so dreadfully bright!&quot;</p>
<p>They moved on into the deep shadow, and there was a pulse</p>
<p>throbbing in Ormiston&#x27;s head and heart like the beating of a</p>
<p>muffed drum.  They paused and faced each other silently.</p>
<p>&quot;Quick, madame!&quot; cried Ormiston, hoarsely, his whole face flushed</p>
<p>wildly.</p>
<p>His strange companion lifted her hand as if to remove the mask,</p>
<p>and he saw that it shook like an aspen.  She made one motion as</p>
<p>though about to lift it, and then recoiled, as if from herself,</p>
<p>in a sort of horror.</p>
<p>&quot;My God!  What is this man urging me to do?  How can I ever</p>
<p>fulfill that fatal promise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, you torture me!&quot; said Ormiston, whose face showed what</p>
<p>he felt.  &quot;You must keep your promise; so do not drive me wild</p>
<p>waiting.  Let me - &quot;</p>
<p>He took a step toward her, as if to lift the mask himself, but</p>
<p>she held out both arms to keep him off.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no!  Come not near me, Malcolm Ormiston!  Fated man,</p>
<p>since you will rush on your doom, Look! and let the sight blast</p>
<p>you, if it will!&quot;</p>
<p>She unfastened her mask, raised it, and with it the profusion of</p>
<p>long, sweeping black hair.</p>
<p>Ormiston did look - in much the same way, perhaps, that Zulinka</p>
<p>looked at the Veiled Prophet.  The next moment there was a</p>
<p>terrible cry, and he fell headlong with a crash, as if a bullet</p>
<p>had whined through his hart.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>
<p>THE INTERVIEW.</p>
<p>I am not aware whether fainting was as much the fashion among the</p>
<p>fair sex, in the days (or rather the nights) of which I have the</p>
<p>honor to hold forth, as at the present time; but I am inclined to</p>
<p>think not, from the simple fact that Leoline, though like John</p>
<p>Bunyan, &quot;grievously troubled and tossed about in her mind,&quot; did</p>
<p>nothing of the kind.  For the first few moments, she was</p>
<p>altogether too stunned by the suddenness of the shock to cry out</p>
<p>or make the least resistance, and was conscious of nothing but of</p>
<p>being rapidly borne along in somebody&#x27;s arms.  When this hazy</p>
<p>view of things passed away, her new sensation was, the intensely</p>
<p>uncomfortable one of being on the verge of suffocation.  She made</p>
<p>one frantic but futile effort to free herself and scream for</p>
<p>help, but the strong arms held her with most loving tightness,</p>
<p>and her cry was drowned in the hot atmosphere within the shawl,</p>
<p>and never passed beyond it.  Most assuredly Leoline would have</p>
<p>been smothered then and there, had their journey been much</p>
<p>longer; but, fortunately for her, it was only the few yards</p>
<p>between her house and the river.  She knew she was then carried</p>
<p>down some steps, and she heard the dip of the oars in the water,</p>
<p>and then her bearer paused, and went through a short dialogue</p>
<p>with somebody else - with Count L&#x27;Estrange, she rather felt than</p>
<p>knew, for nothing was audible but a low murmur.  The only word</p>
<p>she could make out was a low, emphatic &quot;Remember!&quot; in the count&#x27;s</p>
<p>voice, and then she knew she was in a boat, and that it was</p>
<p>shoved off, and moving down the rapid river.  The feeling of heat</p>
<p>and suffocation was dreadful and as her abductor placed her on</p>
<p>some cushions, she made another desperate but feeble effort to</p>
<p>free herself from the smothering shawl, but a hand was laid</p>
<p>lightly on hers, and a voice interposed.</p>
<p>&quot;Lady, it is quite useless for you to struggle, as you are</p>
<p>irrevocably in my power, but if you will promise faithfully not</p>
<p>to make any outcry, and will submit to be blindfolded, I shall</p>
<p>remove this oppressive muffling from your head.  Tell me if you</p>
<p>will promise.&quot;</p>
<p>He had partly raised the shawl, and a gush of free air came</p>
<p>revivingly in, and enabled Leoline to gasp out a faint &quot; I</p>
<p>promise!&quot;  As she spoke, it was lifted off altogether, and she</p>
<p>caught one bright fleeting glimpse of the river, sparkling and</p>
<p>silvery in the moonlight; of the bright blue sky, gemmed with</p>
<p>countless stars, and of some one by her side in the dress of a</p>
<p>court-page, whose face was perfectly unknown to her.  The next</p>
<p>instant, a bandage was bound tightly over her eyes, excluding</p>
<p>every ray of light, while the strange voice again spoke</p>
<p>apologetically</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon, lady, but it is my orders!  I am commanded to treat you</p>
<p>with every respect, but not to let you see where you are borne</p>
<p>to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By what right does Count L&#x27;Estrange commit this outrage!&quot; began</p>
<p>Leoline, almost as imperiously as Miranda herself, and making use</p>
<p>of her tongue, like a true woman, the very first moment it was at</p>
<p>her disposal.  &quot;How dare he carry me off in this atrocious way?</p>
<p>Whoever you are, sir, if you have the spirit of a man, you will</p>
<p>bring me directly back to my own house</p>
<p>&quot;I am very sorry, lady, but I have received orders that must be</p>
<p>obeyed!  You must come with me, but you need fear nothing; you</p>
<p>will be an safe and secure as in your own home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Secure enough, no doubt!&quot; paid Leoline, bitterly.  &quot;I never did</p>
<p>like Count L&#x27;Estrange, but I never knew he was a coward and a</p>
<p>villain till now!&quot;</p>
<p>Her companion made no reply to this forcible address, and there</p>
<p>was a moment&#x27;s indignant silence on Leoline&#x27;s part, broken only</p>
<p>by the dip of the oars, and the rippling of the water.  Then</p>
<p>&quot;Will you not tell me, at least, where you are taking me to?&quot;</p>
<p>haughtily demanded Leoline.</p>
<p>&quot;Lady, I cannot!  It was to prevent you knowing, that you have</p>
<p>been blindfolded.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! your master has a faithful servant, I see!  How long am I to</p>
<p>be kept a prisoner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Count L&#x27;Estrange?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot tell.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where am I to see him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ha!&quot; said Leoline, with infinite contempt, and turning her back</p>
<p>upon him she relapsed into gloomy silence.  It had all been so</p>
<p>sudden, and had taken her so much by surprise, that she had not</p>
<p>had time to think of the consequences until now.  But now they</p>
<p>came upon her with a rush, and with dismal distinctness; and most</p>
<p>distinct among all was, what would Sir Norman say!  Of course,</p>
<p>with all a lover&#x27;s impatience, he would be at his post by</p>
<p>sunrise, would come to look for his bride, and find himself sold!</p>
<p>By that time she would be far enough away, perhaps a melancholy</p>
<p>corpse (and at this dreary passage in her meditations, Leoline</p>
<p>sighed profoundly), and he would never know what had become of</p>
<p>her, or how much and how long she had loved him.  And this</p>
<p>hateful Count L&#x27;Estrange, what did he intend to do with her?</p>
<p>Perhaps go so far as to make her marry him, and imprison her with</p>
<p>the rest of his wives; for Leoline was prepared to think the very</p>
<p>worst of the count, and had not the slightest doubt that he</p>
<p>already had a harem full of abducted wives, somewhere.  But no -</p>
<p>he never could do that, he might do what he liked with weaker</p>
<p>minds, but she never would be a bride of his while the plague or</p>
<p>poison was to be had in London.  And with this invincible</p>
<p>determination rooted fixedly, not to say obstinately, in her</p>
<p>mind, she was nearly pitched overboard by the boat suddenly</p>
<p>landing at some unexpected place.  A little natural scream of</p>
<p>terror was repressed on her lips by a hand being placed over</p>
<p>them, and the determined but perfectly respectful tones of the</p>
<p>person beside her speaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Remember your promise, lady, and do not make a noise.  We have</p>
<p>arrived at our journey&#x27;s end, and if you will take my arm, I will</p>
<p>lead you along, instead of carrying you.&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline was rather surprised to find the journey so short, but</p>
<p>she arose directly, with silence and dignity - at least with as</p>
<p>much of the latter commodity as could be reasonably expected,</p>
<p>considering that boats on water are rather unsteady things to be</p>
<p>dignified in - and was led gently and with care out of the</p>
<p>swaying vessel, and up another flight of stairs.  Then, in a few</p>
<p>moments, she was conscious of passing from the free night air</p>
<p>into the closer atmosphere of a house; and in going through an</p>
<p>endless labyrinth of corridors, and passages, and suites of</p>
<p>rooms, and flights of stairs, until she became so extremely</p>
<p>tired, that she stopped with spirited abruptness, and in the</p>
<p>plainest possible English, gave her conductor to understand that</p>
<p>they had gone about far enough for all practical purposes.  To</p>
<p>which that patient and respectful individual replied that he was</p>
<p>glad to inform her they had but a few more steps to go, which the</p>
<p>next moment proved to be true, for he stopped and announced that</p>
<p>their promenade was over for the night.</p>
<p>&quot;And I suppose I may have the use of my eyes at last?&quot; inquired</p>
<p>Leoline, with more haughtiness than Sir Norman could have</p>
<p>believed possible so gentle a voice could have expressed.</p>
<p>For reply, her companion rapidly untied the bandage, and withdrew</p>
<p>it with a flourish.  The dazzling brightness that burst upon her,</p>
<p>so blinded her, that for a moment she could distinguish nothing;</p>
<p>and when she looked round to contemplate her companion, she found</p>
<p>him hurriedly making his exit, and securely locking the door.</p>
<p>The sound of the key turning in the lock gave her a most peculiar</p>
<p>sensation, which none but those who have experienced it can</p>
<p>properly understand.  It is not the most comfortable feeling in</p>
<p>the world to know you are a prisoner, even if you have no key</p>
<p>turned upon you but the weather, and your jailer be a high east</p>
<p>wind and lashing rain.  Leoline&#x27;s prison and jailer were</p>
<p>something worse; and, for the first time, a chill of fear and</p>
<p>dismay crept icily to the core of her heart.  But Leoline had</p>
<p>something of Miranda&#x27;s courage, as well as her looks and temper;</p>
<p>so she tried to feel as brave as possible, and not think of her</p>
<p>unpleasant predicament while there remained anything else to</p>
<p>think about.  Perhaps she might escape, too; and, as this notion</p>
<p>struck her, she looked with eager anxiety, not unmixed with</p>
<p>curiosity, at the place where she was.  By this time, her eyes</p>
<p>had been accustomed to the light, which proceeded from a great</p>
<p>antique lamp of bronze, pendent by a brass chain from the</p>
<p>ceiling; and she saw she was in a moderately sized and by no</p>
<p>means splendid room.  But what struck her most was, that</p>
<p>everything had a look of age about it, from the glittering oak</p>
<p>beams of the floor to the faded ghostly hangings on the wall.</p>
<p>There was a bed at one end - a great spectral ark of a thing,</p>
<p>like a mausoleum, with drapery as old and spectral as that on the</p>
<p>walls, and in which she could no more have lain than in a moth-</p>
<p>eaten shroud.  The seats and the one table the room held were of</p>
<p>the same ancient and weird pattern, and the sight of them gave</p>
<p>her a shivering sensation not unlike an ague chill.  There was</p>
<p>but one door - a huge structure, with shining panels, securely</p>
<p>locked; and escape from that quarter was utterly out of the</p>
<p>question.  There was one window, hung with dark curtains of</p>
<p>tarnished embroidery, but in pushing them aside, she met only a</p>
<p>dull blank of unlighted glass, for the shutters were firmly</p>
<p>secured without.  Altogether, she could not form the slightest</p>
<p>idea where she was; and, with a feeling of utter despair, she sat</p>
<p>down on one of the queer old chairs, with much the same feeling</p>
<p>as if she were sitting in a tomb.</p>
<p>What would Sir Norman say?  What would he ever think of her, when</p>
<p>he found her gone.  And what was destined to be her fate in this</p>
<p>dreadful out-of-the-way place?  She would have cried, as most of</p>
<p>her sex would be tempted to do in such a situation, but that her</p>
<p>dislike and horror of Count L&#x27;Estrange was a good deal stronger</p>
<p>than her grief, and turned her tears to sparks of indignant fire.</p>
<p>Never, never, never! would she be his wife!  He might kill her a</p>
<p>thousand times, if he liked, and she wouldn&#x27;t yield an inch.  She</p>
<p>did not mind dying in a good cause; she could do it but once.</p>
<p>And with Sir Norman despising her, as she felt he must do, when</p>
<p>he found her run away, she rather liked the idea than otherwise.</p>
<p>Mentally, she bade adieu to all her friends before beginning to</p>
<p>prepare for her melancholy fate - to her handsome lover, to his</p>
<p>gallant friend Ormiston, to her poor nurse, Prudence, and to her</p>
<p>mysterious visitor, La Masque.</p>
<p>La Masque!  Ah! that name awoke a new chord of recollection - the</p>
<p>casket, she had it with her yet.  Instantly, everything was</p>
<p>forgotten but it and its contents; and she placed a chair</p>
<p>directly under the lamp, drew it out, and looked at it.  It was a</p>
<p>pretty little bijou itself, with its polished ivory surface, and</p>
<p>shining clasps of silver.  But the inside had far more interest</p>
<p>for her than the outside, and she fitted the key and unlocked it</p>
<p>with a trembling hand.  It was lined with azure velvet, wrought</p>
<p>with silver thread, in dainty wreathe of water lilies; and in the</p>
<p>bottom, neatly folded, lay a sheet of foolscap.  She opened it</p>
<p>with nervous haste; it was a common sheet enough, stamped with</p>
<p>fool&#x27;s cap and bells, that showed it belonged to Cromwell&#x27;s time.</p>
<p>It was closely written, in a light, fair hand, and bore the title</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline&#x27;s History.&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline&#x27;s hand trembled so with eagerness, she could scarcely</p>
<p>hold the paper; but her eye rapidly ran from line to line, and</p>
<p>she stopped not till she reached the end.  While she read, her</p>
<p>face alternately flushed and paled, her eyes dilated, her lips</p>
<p>parted; and before she finished it, there came over all a look of</p>
<p>the most unutterable horror.  It dropped from her powerless</p>
<p>fingers as she finished; and she sank back in her chair with such</p>
<p>a ghastly paleness, that it seemed absolutely like the lividness</p>
<p>of death.</p>
<p>A sudden and startling noise awoke her from her trance of horror</p>
<ul>
<li>some one trying to get in at the window!  The chill of terror</li>
</ul>
<p>it sent through every vein acted as a sort of counter-irritant to</p>
<p>the other feeling, and she sprang from her chair and turned her</p>
<p>face fearfully toward the sounds.  But in all her terror she did</p>
<p>not forget the mysterious sheet of foolscap, which lay, looking</p>
<p>up at her, on the floor; and she snatched it up, and thrust it</p>
<p>and the casket out of sight.  Still the sounds went on, but</p>
<p>softly and cautiously; and at intervals, as if the worker were</p>
<p>afraid of being heard.  Leoline went back, step by step, to the</p>
<p>other extremity of the room, with her eyes still fixed on the</p>
<p>window, and on her face a white terror, that left her perfectly</p>
<p>colorless.</p>
<p>Who could it be?  Not Count L&#x27;Estrange, for he would surely not</p>
<p>need to enter his own house like a burglar - not Sir Norman</p>
<p>Kingsley, for he could certainly not find out her abduction and</p>
<p>her prison so soon, and she had no other friends in the whole</p>
<p>wide world to trouble themselves about her.  There was one, but</p>
<p>the idea of ever seeing her again was so unspeakably dreadful,</p>
<p>that she would rather have seen the most horrible spectre her</p>
<p>imagination could conjure up, than that tall, graceful,</p>
<p>rich-robed form.</p>
<p>Still the noises perseveringly continued; there was the sound of</p>
<p>withdrawing bolts, and then a pale ray of moonlight shot between</p>
<p>the parted curtains, shoving the shutters had been opened.</p>
<p>Whiter and whiter Leoline grew, and she felt herself growing cold</p>
<p>and rigid with mortal fear.  Softly the window was raised, a hand</p>
<p>stole in and parted the curtains, and a pale face and two great</p>
<p>dark eyes wandered slowly round the room, and rested at last on</p>
<p>her, standing, like a galvanized corpse, as far from the window</p>
<p>as the wall would permit.  The hand was lifted in a warning</p>
<p>gesture, as if to enforce silence; the window was raised still</p>
<p>higher, a figure, lithe and agile as a cat, sprang lightly into</p>
<p>the room, and standing with his back to her, re-closed the</p>
<p>shutters, re-shut the window, and re-drew the curtains, before</p>
<p>taking the trouble to turn round.</p>
<p>This discreet little manoeuvre, which showed her visitor was</p>
<p>human, and gifted with human prudence, re-assured Leoline a</p>
<p>little; and, to judge by the reverse of the medal, the nocturnal</p>
<p>intruder was nothing very formidable after all.  But the stranger</p>
<p>did not keep her long in suspense; while she stood gazing at him,</p>
<p>as if fascinated, he turned round, stepped forward, took off his</p>
<p>cap, made her a courtly bow, and then straightening himself up,</p>
<p>prepared, with great coolness, to scrutinize and be scrutinized.</p>
<p>Well might they look at each other; for the two faces were</p>
<p>perfectly the same, and each one saw himself and herself as</p>
<p>others saw them.  There was the same coal-black, curling hair;</p>
<p>the same lustrous dark eyes; the same clear, colorless</p>
<p>complexion, the same delicate, perfect features; nothing was</p>
<p>different but the costume and the expression.  That latter was</p>
<p>essentially different, for the young lady&#x27;s betrayed amazement,</p>
<p>terror, doubt, and delight all at once; while the young</p>
<p>gentleman&#x27;s was a grand, careless surprise, mixed with just a</p>
<p>dash of curiosity.</p>
<p>He was the first to speak; and after they had stared at each</p>
<p>other for the space of five minutes, he described a graceful</p>
<p>sweep with his hand, and held forth in the following strain</p>
<p>&quot;I greatly fear, fair Leoline, that I have startled you by my</p>
<p>sudden and surprising entrance; and if I have been the cause of a</p>
<p>moment&#x27;s alarm to one so perfectly beautiful, I shall hate myself</p>
<p>for ever after.  If I could have got in any other way, rest</p>
<p>assured I would not have risked my neck and your peace of mind by</p>
<p>such a suspicious means of ingress as the window; but if you will</p>
<p>take the trouble to notice, the door is thick, and I am composed</p>
<p>of too solid flesh to whisk through the keyhole; so I had to make</p>
<p>my appearance the best way I could.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; faintly asked Leoline.</p>
<p>&quot;Your friend, fair lady, and Sir Norman Kingsley&#x27;s.&quot;</p>
<p>Hubert looked to see Leoline start and blush, and was deeply</p>
<p>gratified to see her do both; and her whole pretty countenance</p>
<p>became alive with new-born hope, as if that name were a magic</p>
<p>talisman of freedom and joy.</p>
<p>&quot;What is your name, and who are you?&quot; she inquired, in a</p>
<p>breathless sort of way, that made Hubert look at her a moment in</p>
<p>calm astonishment.</p>
<p>&quot;I have told you your friend; christened at some remote period,</p>
<p>Hubert.  For further particulars, apply to the Earl of Rochester,</p>
<p>whose page I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Earl of Rochester&#x27;s page!&quot; she repeated, in the same quick,</p>
<p>excited way, that surprised and rather lowered her in that good</p>
<p>youth&#x27;s opinion, for giving way to any feelings so plebeian.  &quot;It</p>
<p>is - it must be the same!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt of it,&quot; said Hubert.  &quot;The same what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you not come from France - from Dijon, recently?&quot; went on</p>
<p>Leoline, rather inappositely, as it struck her hearer.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly I came from Dijon.  Had I the honor of being known to</p>
<p>you there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How strange!  How wonderful!&quot; said Leoline, with a paling cheek</p>
<p>and quickened breathing.  &quot;How mysterious those things turn out I</p>
<p>Thank Heaven that I have found some one to love at last!&quot;</p>
<p>This speech, which was Greek, algebra, high Dutch, or</p>
<p>thereabouts, to Master Hubert, caused him to stare to such an</p>
<p>extent, that when he came to think of it afterward, positively</p>
<p>shocked him.  The two great, wondering dark eyes transfixing her</p>
<p>with so much amazement, brought Leoline to a sense of her talking</p>
<p>unfathomable mysteries, quite incomprehensible to her handsome</p>
<p>auditor.  She looked at him with a smile, held out her hand; and</p>
<p>Hubert received a strange little electric thrill, to see that her</p>
<p>eyes were full of tears.   He took the hand and raised it to his</p>
<p>lips, wondering if the young lady, struck by his good looks, had</p>
<p>conceived a rash and inordinate attack of love at first sight,</p>
<p>and was about to offer herself to him and discard Sir Norman for</p>
<p>ever.  From this speculation, the sweet voice aroused him.</p>
<p>&quot;You have told me who you are.  Now, do you know who I am?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope so, fairest Leoline.  I know you are the most beautiful</p>
<p>lady in England, and to-morrow will be called Lady Kingsley!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am something more,&quot; said Leoline, holding his hand between</p>
<p>both hers, and bending near him; &quot; I am your sister!&quot;</p>
<p>The Earl of Rochester&#x27;s page must have had good blood in his</p>
<p>veins; for never was there duke, grandee, or peer of the realm,</p>
<p>more radically and unaffectedly nonchalant than he.  To this</p>
<p>unexpected announcement he listened with most dignified and</p>
<p>well-bred composure, and in his secret heart, or rather vanity,</p>
<p>more disappointed than otherwise, to find his first solution of</p>
<p>her tenderness a great mistake.  Leoline held his hand tight in</p>
<p>hers, and looked with loving and tearful eyes in his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Hubert, you are my brother - my long-unknown brother, and I</p>
<p>love you with my whole heart!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I?&quot; said Hubert.  &quot;I dare say I am, for they all say we look</p>
<p>as much alike as two peas.  I am excessively delighted to hear</p>
<p>it, and to know that you love me.  Permit me to embrace my new</p>
<p>relative.&quot;</p>
<p>With which the court page kissed Leoline with emphasis, while she</p>
<p>scarcely knew whether to laugh, cry, or be provoked at his</p>
<p>composure.  On the whole, she did a little of all three, and</p>
<p>pushed him away with a halt pout.</p>
<p>&quot;You insensible mortal!  How can you stand there and hear that</p>
<p>you have found a sister with so much indifference?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indifferent?  Not I!  You have no idea how wildly excited I am!&quot;</p>
<p>said Hubert, in a voice not betokening the slightest emotion.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you find it out, Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind!  I shall tell you that again.  You don&#x27;t doubt it, I</p>
<p>hope?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not!  I knew from the first moment I set eyes on you,</p>
<p>that if you were not my sister, you ought to be!  I wish you&#x27;d</p>
<p>tell me all the particulars, Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall do so as soon as I am out of this; but how can I tell</p>
<p>you anything here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s true!&quot; said Hubert, reflectively.  &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll wait.</p>
<p>Now, don&#x27;t you wonder how I found you out, and came here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed I do.  How was it, Hubert?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, well, I don&#x27;t know as I can altogether tell you; but you</p>
<p>see, Sir Norman Kingsley being possessed of an inspiration that</p>
<p>something was happening to you, came to your house a short time</p>
<p>ago, and, as he suspected, discovered that you were missing.  I</p>
<p>met him there, rather depressed in his mind about it, and he told</p>
<p>me - beginning the conversation, I must say, in a very excited</p>
<p>manner,&quot; said Hubert, parenthetically, as memory recalled the</p>
<p>furious shaking he had undergone - &quot;and he told me he fancied you</p>
<p>were abducted, and by one Count L&#x27;Estrange.  Now I had a hazy</p>
<p>idea who Count L&#x27;Estrange was, and where he would be most apt to</p>
<p>take you to; and so I came here, and after some searching, more</p>
<p>inquiring, and a few unmitigated falsehoods (you&#x27;ll regret to</p>
<p>hear), discovered you were locked up in this place, and succeeded</p>
<p>in getting in through the window.  Sir Norman is waiting for me</p>
<p>in a state of distraction so now, having found you, I will go and</p>
<p>relieve his mind by reporting accordingly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And leave me here?&quot; cried Leoline, in affright, &quot;and in the</p>
<p>power of Count L&#x27;Estrange?  Oh! no, no!  You must take me with</p>
<p>you, Hubert!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Leoline, it is quite impossible to do it without help,</p>
<p>and without a ladder.  I will return to Sir Norman; and when the</p>
<p>darkness comes that precedes day-dawn, we will raise the ladder</p>
<p>to your window, and try to get you out.  Be patient - only wait</p>
<p>an hour or two, and then you will be free.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, O Hubert, where am I?  What dreadful place it this?&quot; .</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I do not know that this is a very dreadful place; and most</p>
<p>people consider it a sufficiently respectable house; but, still,</p>
<p>I would rather see my sister anywhere else than in it, and will</p>
<p>take the trouble of kidnapping her out of it as quickly as</p>
<p>possible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, Hubert, tell me - do tell me, who is Count L&#x27;Estrange?&quot;</p>
<p>Hubert laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;Cannot, really, Leoline! at least, not until to-morrow, and you</p>
<p>are Lady Kingsley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, what if he should come here to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not think there is much danger of that, but whether he does</p>
<p>or not, rest assured you shall be free to-morrow!  At all events,</p>
<p>it is quite impossible for you to escape with me now; and even as</p>
<p>it is, I run the risk of being detected, and made a prisoner,</p>
<p>myself.  You must be patient and wait, Leoline, and trust to</p>
<p>Providence and your brother Hubert!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I must, I suppose!&quot; said Leoline, sighing, &quot;and you cannot take</p>
<p>me away until day-dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite impossible; and then all this drapery of yours will be</p>
<p>ever so much in the way.  Would you object to garments like</p>
<p>these?&quot; pointing to his doublet and hose.  &quot;If you would not, I</p>
<p>think I could procure you a fit-out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I should, though!&quot; said Leoline, with spirit &quot;and most</p>
<p>decidedly, too!  I shall wear nothing of the kind, Sir Page!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Every one to her fancy!&quot; said Hubert, with a French shrug, &quot;and</p>
<p>my pretty sister shall have hers in spite of earth, air, fire,</p>
<p>and water!  And now, fair Leoline, for a brief time, adieu, and</p>
<p>au revoir !&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will not fail me!&quot; exclaimed Leoline, earnestly, clasping</p>
<p>her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;If I do, it shall be the last thing I will fail in on earth; for</p>
<p>if I am alive by to-morrow morning, Leoline shall be free!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you will be careful - you will both be careful!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excessively careful!  Now then.&quot;</p>
<p>The last two words were addressed to the window which he</p>
<p>noiselessly opened as he spoke.  Leoline caught a glimpse of the</p>
<p>bright free moonlight, and watched him with desperate envy; but</p>
<p>the next moment the shutters were closed, and Hubert and the</p>
<p>moonlight were both gone.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XIX</p>
<p>HUBERT&#x27;S WHISPER.</p>
<p>Sir Norman Kingsley&#x27;s consternation and horror on discovering the</p>
<p>dead body of his friend, was only equalled by his amazement as to</p>
<p>how he got there, or how he came to be dead at all.  The livid</p>
<p>face, up turned to the moonlight, was unmistakably the face of a</p>
<p>dead man - it was no swoon, no deception, like Leoline&#x27;s; for the</p>
<p>blue, ghastly paleness that marks the flight of the soul from the</p>
<p>body was stamped on every rigid feature.  Yet, Sir Norman could</p>
<p>not realize it.  We all know how hard it is to realize the death</p>
<p>of a friend from whom we have but lately parted in full health</p>
<p>and life, and Ormiston&#x27;s death was so sudden.  Why, it was not</p>
<p>quite two hours since they had parted in Leoline&#x27;s house, and</p>
<p>even the plague could not carry off a victim as quickly as this.</p>
<p>&quot;Ormiston!  Ormiston!&quot; he called, between grief and dismay, as he</p>
<p>raised him in his arms, with his hand over the stilled heart; but</p>
<p>Ormiston answered not, and the heart gave no pulsation beneath</p>
<p>his fingers.  He tore open his doublet, as the thought of the</p>
<p>plague flashed through his mind, but no plague-spot was to be</p>
<p>seen, and it was quite evident, from the appearance of the face,</p>
<p>that he had not died of the distemper, neither was there any</p>
<p>wound or mark to show that he had met his end violently.  Yet the</p>
<p>cold, white face was convulsed, as if he had died in throes of</p>
<p>agony, the hands were clenched, till the nails sank into the</p>
<p>flesh; and that was the only outward sign or token that he had</p>
<p>suffered in expiring.</p>
<p>Sir Norman was completely at a lose, and half beside himself,</p>
<p>with a thousand conflicting feelings of sorrow, astonishment, and</p>
<p>mystification.  The rapid and exciting events of the night had</p>
<p>turned his head into a mental chaos, as they very well might, but</p>
<p>he still had commonsense enough left to know that something must</p>
<p>be done about this immediately.  He knew the best place to take</p>
<p>Ormiston was to the nearest apothecary&#x27;s shop, which</p>
<p>establishments were generally open, and filled, the whole</p>
<p>livelong night, by the sick and their friends.  As he was</p>
<p>meditating whether or not to call the surly watchman to help him</p>
<p>carry the body, a pest-cart came, providentially, along, and the</p>
<p>driver-seeing a young man bending over a prostrate form-guessed</p>
<p>at once what was the matter, and came to a halt.</p>
<p>&quot;Another one!&quot; he said, coming leisurely up, and glancing at the</p>
<p>lifeless form with a very professional eye.  &quot;Well, I think there</p>
<p>is room for another one in the cart; so bear a hand, friend, and</p>
<p>let us have him out of this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are mistaken!&quot; said Sir Norman sharply, &quot;he has not died of</p>
<p>the plague.  I am not even certain whether he is dead at all.&quot;</p>
<p>The driver looked at Sir Norman, then stooped down and touched</p>
<p>Ormiston&#x27;s icy face, and listened to hear him breathe.  He stood</p>
<p>up after a moment, with some thing like a small laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;If he&#x27;s alive,&quot; he said, turning to go, &quot;then I never saw any</p>
<p>one dead!  Good night, sir, I wish you joy when you bring him</p>
<p>to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay!&quot; exclaimed the young man, &quot;I wish you to assist me in</p>
<p>bringing him to yonder apothecary&#x27;s shop, and you may have this</p>
<p>for your pains.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This &quot; proved to be a talisman of alacrity; for the man pocketed</p>
<p>it, and briskly laid hold of Ormiston by the feet, while Sir</p>
<p>Norman wrapped his cloak reverently about him and took him by the</p>
<p>shoulders.  In this style his body was conveyed to the</p>
<p>apothecary&#x27;s shop which they found half full of applicants for</p>
<p>medicine, among whom their entrance with the corpse produced no</p>
<p>greater sensation than a momentary stare.  The attire and bearing</p>
<p>of Sir Norman proving him to be something different from their</p>
<p>usual class of visitors, bringing one of the drowsy apprentices</p>
<p>immediately to his side, inquiring what were his orders.</p>
<p>&quot;A private room, and your master&#x27;s attendance directly,&quot; was the</p>
<p>authoritative reply.</p>
<p>Both were to be had; the former, a hole in the wall behind the</p>
<p>shop; the latter, a pallid, cadaverous-looking person, with the</p>
<p>air of one who had been dead a week, thought better of it and</p>
<p>rose again.  There was a long table in the aforesaid hole in the</p>
<p>wall, bearing a strong family likeness to a dissecting-table;</p>
<p>upon which the stark figure was laid, and the pest-cart driver</p>
<p>disappeared.  The apothecary held a mirror close to the, face;</p>
<p>applied his ear to the pulse and heart; held a pocket-mirror over</p>
<p>his mouth, looked at it; shook his head; and set down the candle</p>
<p>with decision.</p>
<p>&quot;The man is dead, sir!&quot; was his criticism, &quot;dead as a door nail!</p>
<p>All the medicine in the shop wouldn&#x27;t kindle one spark of life in</p>
<p>such ashes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At least, try!  Try something - bleeding for instance,&quot;</p>
<p>suggested Sir Norman.</p>
<p>Again the apothecary examined the body, and again he shook his</p>
<p>head dolefully.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s no use, sir: but, if it will please, you can try.&quot;</p>
<p>The right arm was bared; the lancet inserted, one or two black</p>
<p>drops sluggishly followed and nothing more.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all a waste of time, you see,&quot; remarked the apothecary,</p>
<p>wiping his dreadful little weapon, &quot;he&#x27;s as dead as ever I saw</p>
<p>anybody in my life!  How did he come to his end, sir - not by the</p>
<p>plague?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; said Sir Norman, gloomily.  &quot;I wish you would</p>
<p>tell me that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can&#x27;t do it, sir; my skill doesn&#x27;t extend that far.  There is no</p>
<p>plague-spot or visible wound or bruise on the person; so he must</p>
<p>have died of some internal complaint - probably disease of the</p>
<p>heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never knew him to have such a thing,&quot; said Sir Norman, sighing.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very mysterious and very dreadful, and notwithstanding all</p>
<p>you have said, I cannot believe him dead.  Can he not remain here</p>
<p>until morning, at least?&quot;</p>
<p>The starved apothecary looked at him out of a pair of hollow,</p>
<p>melancholy eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold can do anything,&quot; was his plaintive reply.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand.  You shall have it.  Are you sure you can do</p>
<p>nothing more for him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing whatever, sir; and excuse me, but there are customers in</p>
<p>the shop, and I must leave, sir.&quot;</p>
<p>Which he did, accordingly; and Sir Norman was left alone with all</p>
<p>that remained of him who, two hours before, was his warm friend.</p>
<p>He could scarcely believe that it was the calm majesty of death</p>
<p>that so changed the expression of that white face, and yet, the</p>
<p>longer he looked, the more deeply an inward conviction assured</p>
<p>him that it was so.  He chafed the chilling hands and face, he</p>
<p>applied hartshorn and burnt feathers to the nostrils, but all</p>
<p>these applications, though excellent in their way, could not</p>
<p>exactly raise the dead to life, and, in this case, proved a</p>
<p>signal, failure.  He gave up his doctoring, at last, in despair,</p>
<p>and folding his arms, looked down at what lay on the table, and</p>
<p>tried to convince himself that it was Ormiston.  So absorbed was</p>
<p>he in the endeavor, that he heeded not the passing moments, until</p>
<p>it struck him with a shock that Hubert might even now be waiting</p>
<p>for him at the trysting-place, with news of Leoline.  Love is</p>
<p>stronger than friendship, stronger than grief, stronger than</p>
<p>death, stronger than every other feeling in the world; so he</p>
<p>suddenly seized his bat, turned his back on Ormiston and the</p>
<p>apothecary&#x27;s shop, and strode oft to the place he had quitted.</p>
<p>No Hubert was there, but two figures were passing slowly along in</p>
<p>the moonlight, and one of them he recognized, with an impulse to</p>
<p>spring at him like a tiger and strangle him.  But he had been so</p>
<p>shocked and subdued by his recent discovery, that the impulse</p>
<p>which, half an hour before, would have been unhesitatingly</p>
<p>obeyed, went for nothing, now; and there was more of reproach,</p>
<p>even, than anger in his voice, as he went over and laid his hand</p>
<p>on the shoulder of one of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Stay!&quot; he said.  &quot;One word with you, Count L&#x27;Estrange.  What</p>
<p>have you done with Leoline!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!  Sir Norman, as I live!&quot; cried the count wheeling round and</p>
<p>lifting his hat.  &quot;Give me good even - or rather, good morning -</p>
<p>Kingsley, for St. Paul&#x27;s has long gone the midnight hour.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman, with his hand still on his shoulder, returned not the</p>
<p>courtesy, and regarding the gallant count with a stern eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Leoline?&quot; he frigidly repeated.</p>
<p>&quot;Really,&quot; said the count, with some embarrassment,&quot;you attack me</p>
<p>so unexpectedly, and so like a ghost or a highwayman - by the way</p>
<p>I have a word to say to you about highwaymen, and was seeking you</p>
<p>to say it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Leoline?&quot; shouted the exasperated young knight,</p>
<p>releasing his shoulder, and clutching him by the throat.  &quot;Tell</p>
<p>me or, by Heaven! I&#x27;ll pitch you neck and heels into the Thames!&quot;</p>
<p>Instantly the sword of the count&#x27;s companion flashed in the</p>
<p>moonlight, and, in two seconds more, its blue blade would have</p>
<p>ended the earthly career of Sir Norman Kingsley, had not the</p>
<p>count quickly sprang back, and made a motion for his companion to</p>
<p>hold.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; he cried, commandingly, with his arm outstretched to</p>
<p>each.  &quot;Keep off!  George, sheathe your sword and stand aside.</p>
<p>Sir Norman Kingsley, one word with you, and be it in peace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There can be no peace between us,&quot; replied that aggravated young</p>
<p>gentleman, fiercely &quot;until you tell me what has become of</p>
<p>Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All in good time.  We have a listener, and does it mot strike</p>
<p>you our conference should be private!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Public or private, it matters not a jot, so that you tell me</p>
<p>what you&#x27;ve done with Leoline,&quot; replied Sir Norman, with whom it</p>
<p>was evident getting beyond this question was a moral and physical</p>
<p>impossibility.  &quot;And if you do not give an account of yourself,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll run you through as sure as your name is Count L&#x27;Estrange!&quot;</p>
<p>A strange sort of smile came over the face of the count at this</p>
<p>direful threat, as if he fancied in that case, he was safe</p>
<p>enough; but Sir Norman, luckily, did not see it, and heard only</p>
<p>the suave reply:</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, Sir Norman; I shall be delighted to do so.  Let us</p>
<p>stand over there in the shadow of that arch; and, George, do you</p>
<p>remain here within call.&quot;</p>
<p>The count blandly waved Sir Norman to follow, which Sir Norman</p>
<p>did, with much the mein of a sulky lion; and, a moment after,</p>
<p>both were facing each other within the archway.</p>
<p>&quot;Well!&quot; cried the young knight, impatiently; &quot;I am waiting.  Go</p>
<p>on!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Kingsley,&quot; responded the count, in his easy way, &quot;I</p>
<p>think you are laboring under a little mistake.  I have nothing to</p>
<p>go on about; it is you who are to begin the controversy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you dare to play with me?&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, furiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you to take care how you speak!  What have you done with</p>
<p>Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That is the fourth or fifth time that you&#x27;ve asked me that</p>
<p>question,&quot; said the count, with provoking indifference.  &quot;What do</p>
<p>you imagine I have done with her?&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman&#x27;s feelings, which had been rising ever since their</p>
<p>meeting, got up to such a height at this aggravating question,</p>
<p>that he gave vent to an oath, and laid his hand on him sword; but</p>
<p>the count&#x27;s hand lightly interposed before it came out.</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet, Sir Norman.  Be calm; talk rationally.  What do you</p>
<p>accuse me of doing with Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you dare deny having carried her off?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Deny it?  No; I am never afraid to father my own deeds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Sir Norman grinding his teeth.  &quot;Then you acknowledge</p>
<p>it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I acknowledge it - yes.  What next?&quot;</p>
<p>The perfect composure of his tone fell like a cool, damp towel on</p>
<p>the fire of Sir Norman&#x27;s wrath.  It did not quite extinguish the</p>
<p>flame, however - only quenched it a little - and it still hissed</p>
<p>hotly underneath.</p>
<p>&quot;And you dare to stand before me and acknowledge such an act?&quot;</p>
<p>exclaimed Sir Norman, perfectly astounded at the cool assurance</p>
<p>of the man.</p>
<p>&quot;Verily, yea,&quot; said the count, laughing.  &quot;I seldom take the</p>
<p>trouble to deny my acts.  What next?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing next,&quot; said Sir Norman, severely, &quot;until we</p>
<p>have come to a proper understanding about this.  Are you aware,</p>
<p>sir, that that lady is my promised bride?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I do not know that I am.  On the contrary, I have an idea</p>
<p>she is mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She was, you mean.  You know she was forced into consenting by</p>
<p>yourself and her nurse!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Still she consented; and a bond is a bond, and a promise a</p>
<p>promise, all the world over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not with a woman,&quot; said Sir Norman, with stern dogmatism.  &quot;It</p>
<p>is their privilege to break their promise and change their mind</p>
<p>sixty times an hour, if they choose.  Leoline has seen fit to do</p>
<p>both, and has accepted me in your stead; therefore I command you</p>
<p>instantly to give her up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Softly, my friend - softly.  How was I to know all this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You ought to have known it!&quot; returned Sir Norman, in the same</p>
<p>dogmatical way; &quot;or if you didn&#x27;t, you do now; so say no more</p>
<p>about it.  Where is she, I tell you?&quot; repeated the young man, in</p>
<p>a frenzy.</p>
<p>&quot;Your patience one moment longer, until we see which of us has</p>
<p>the best right to the lady.  I have a prior claim.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A forced one.  Leoline does not care a snap far you - and she</p>
<p>loves me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What extraordinary bad taste!&quot; raid the count, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Did she tell you that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes; she did tell me this, and a great deal more.  Come - have</p>
<p>done talking, and tell me where she is, or I&#x27;ll - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, you wouldn&#x27;t!&quot; said the count, teasingly.  &quot;Since</p>
<p>matters stand in this light I&#x27;ll tell you what I&#x27;ll do.  I</p>
<p>acknowledge that I carried off Leoline, viewing her as my</p>
<p>promised bride, and have sent her to my own home in the care of a</p>
<p>trusty messenger, where I give you my word of honor, I have not</p>
<p>been since.  She is as safe there, and much safer than in her own</p>
<p>house, until morning, and it would be a pity to disturb her at</p>
<p>this unseasonable hour.  When the morning comes, we will both go</p>
<p>to her together - state our rival claims - and whichever one she</p>
<p>decides on accepting, can have her, and end the matter at once.&quot;</p>
<p>The count paused and meditated.  This proposal was all very</p>
<p>plausible and nice on the surface, but Sir Norman with his usual</p>
<p>penetration and acuteness, looked farther than the surface, and</p>
<p>found a flaw.</p>
<p>&quot;And how am I to know,&quot; he asked, doubtingly, &quot;that you will not</p>
<p>go to her to-night and spirit her off where I will never hear of</p>
<p>either of you again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the very best way in the world: we will not part company</p>
<p>until morning comes, are we at peace?&quot; inquired the count,</p>
<p>smiling and holding out but hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Until then, we will have to be, I suppose,&quot; replied Sir Norman,</p>
<p>rather ungraciously taking the hand as if it were red-hot, and</p>
<p>dropping it again.  &quot;And we are to stand here and rail at each</p>
<p>other, in the meantime?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By no means!  Even the most sublime prospect tires when surveyed</p>
<p>too long.  There is a little excursion which I would like you to</p>
<p>accompany me on, if you have no objection.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To the ruin, where you have already been twice to-night.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman stared.</p>
<p>&quot;And who told you this fact, Sir Count?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind; I have heard it.  Would you object to a third</p>
<p>excursion there before morning?&quot;</p>
<p>Again Sir Norman paused and meditated.  There was no use in</p>
<p>staying where he was, that would bring him no nearer to Leoline,</p>
<p>and nothing was to be gained by killing the count beyond the mere</p>
<p>transitory pleasure of the thing.  On the other hand, he had an</p>
<p>intense and ardent desire to re-visit the ruin, and learn what</p>
<p>had become of Miranda  -the only draw-back being that, if they</p>
<p>were found they would both be most assuredly beheaded.  Then,</p>
<p>again, there was Hubert.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; inquired the count, as Sir Norman looked up.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no objection to go with you to the ruin,&quot; was the reply,</p>
<p>&quot;only this; if we are seen there, we will be dead men two minutes</p>
<p>after; and I have no desire to depart this life until I have had</p>
<p>that promised interview with Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have thought of that,&quot; said the count, &quot;and have provided for</p>
<p>it.  We may venture in the lion&#x27;s den without the slightest</p>
<p>danger:  all that is required being your promise to guide us</p>
<p>thither.  Do you give it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do; but I expect a friend here shortly, and cannot start until</p>
<p>he comes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you mean me by that, I am here,&quot; said a voice at his elbow;</p>
<p>and, looking round, he saw Hubert himself, standing there, a</p>
<p>quiet listener and spectator of the scene.</p>
<p>Count L&#x27;Estrange looked at him with interest, and Hubert,</p>
<p>affecting not to notice the survey, watched Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; was that individual&#x27;s eager address, &quot;were you</p>
<p>successful?&quot;</p>
<p>The count was still watching the boy so intently, that that most</p>
<p>discreet youth was suddenly seized with a violent fit of</p>
<p>coughing, which precluded all possibility of reply for at least</p>
<p>five minutes; and Sir Norman, at the same moment, felt his arm</p>
<p>receive a sharp and warning pinch.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this your friend?&quot; asked the count.  &quot;He is a very small one,</p>
<p>and seems in a bad state of health.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman, still under the influence of the pinch, replied by an</p>
<p>inaudible murmur, and looked with a deeply mystified expression,</p>
<p>at Hubert.</p>
<p>&quot;He bears a strong resemblance to the lady we were talking of a</p>
<p>moment ago,&quot; continued the count - &quot;is sufficiently like her, in</p>
<p>fact, to be her brother; and, I see wears the livery of the Earl</p>
<p>of Rochester.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;God spare you your eye-sight!&quot; said Sir Norman, impatiently.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you not see, among the rest, that I have a few words to say</p>
<p>to him in private?  Permit us to leave you for a moment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no need to do so.  I will leave you, as I have a few</p>
<p>words to say to the person who is with me.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying the count walked away, and Hubert followed him with a</p>
<p>most curious look.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; cried Sir Norman, eagerly, &quot;what news?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good!&quot; said the boy.  &quot;Leoline is safe!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not far from here.  Didn&#x27;t he tell you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The count ?  No - yes; he said she was at his house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.  That is where she is,&quot; said Hubert, looking much</p>
<p>relieved.  &quot;And, at present, perfectly safe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And did you see her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course; and heard her too.  She was dreadfully anxious to</p>
<p>come with me; but that was out of the question.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how is she to be got away?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I do not clearly see.  We will have to bring a ladder, and</p>
<p>there will be so much danger, and so little chance of success,</p>
<p>that, to me it seems an almost hopeless task.  Where did you meet</p>
<p>Count L&#x27;Estrange?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here; and he told me that he bad abducted her, and held her a</p>
<p>prisoner in his own house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He owned that did he?  I wonder you were not fit to kill him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I was, at first, but he talked the matter over somehow.&quot;</p>
<p>And hereupon Sir Norman briefly and quickly rehearsed the</p>
<p>substance of their conversation.  Hubert listened to it</p>
<p>attentively, and laughed as he concluded.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I do not see that you can do otherwise, Sir Norman, and I</p>
<p>think it would be wise to obey the count for to-night, at least.</p>
<p>Then to-morrow - if things do not go on well, we can take the law</p>
<p>in our own hands.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can we?&quot; said Sir Norman, doubtfully, &quot;I do wish you would tell</p>
<p>me who this infernal count is, Hubert, for I am certain you</p>
<p>know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not until to-morrow - you shall know him then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To-morrow! to-morrow!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, disconsolately.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything is postponed until to-morrow!  Oh, here comes the</p>
<p>count back again.  Are we going to start now, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is your friend to accompany us on our expedition?&quot; inquired the</p>
<p>count, standing before them.  &quot; It shall be quite as you say, Mr.</p>
<p>Kingsley.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My friend can do as he pleases.  What do you say, Hubert?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I should like to go, of all things, if neither of you have any</p>
<p>objections.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, then,&quot; said the count, &quot;we will find horses in</p>
<p>readiness a short distance from this.&quot;</p>
<p>The three started together, and walked on in silence through</p>
<p>several streets, until they reached a retired inn, where the</p>
<p>count&#x27;s recent companion stood, with the horses.  Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange whispered a few words to him, upon which he bowed and</p>
<p>retired; and in an instant they were all in the saddle, and</p>
<p>galloping away.</p>
<p>The journey was rather a silent one, and what conversation there</p>
<p>was, was principally sustained by the count.  Hubert&#x27;s usual flow</p>
<p>of pertinent chat seemed to have forsaken him, and Sir Norman had</p>
<p>so many other things to think of - Leoline, Ormiston, Miranda,</p>
<p>and the mysterious count himself - that he felt in no mood for</p>
<p>talking.  Soon, they left the city behind them; the succeeding</p>
<p>two miles were quickly passed over, and the &quot;Golden Crown,&quot; all</p>
<p>dark and forsaken, now hove in sight.  As they reached this, and</p>
<p>cantered up the road leading to the ruin, Sir Norman drew rein,</p>
<p>and said:</p>
<p>&quot;I think our best plan would be, to dismount, and lead our horses</p>
<p>the rest of the way, and not incur any unnecessary danger by</p>
<p>making a noise.  We can fasten them to these trees, where they</p>
<p>will be at hand when we come out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait one moment,&quot; said the count, lifting his finger with a</p>
<p>listening look.  &quot;Listen to that!&quot;</p>
<p>It was a regular tramp of horses&#x27; hoofs, sounding in the silence</p>
<p>like a charge of cavalry.  While they looked, a troop of horsemen</p>
<p>came galloping up, and came to a halt when they saw the count.</p>
<p>No words can depict the look of amazement Sir Norman&#x27;s face wore;</p>
<p>but Hubert betrayed not the least surprise.  The count glanced at</p>
<p>his companions with a significant smile, and riding back, held a</p>
<p>brief colloquy with him who seemed the leader of the horsemen.</p>
<p>He rode up to them, smiling still, and saying, as he passed</p>
<p>&quot;Now then, Kingsley; lead on, and we will follow!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I go not one step further,&quot; said Sir Norman, firmly, &quot;until I</p>
<p>know who I am leading.  Who are you, Count L&#x27;Estrange?&quot;</p>
<p>The count looked at him, but did not answer.  A warning hand -</p>
<p>that of Hubert - grasped Sir Norman&#x27;s arm; and Hubert&#x27;s voice</p>
<p>whispered hurriedly in his ear:</p>
<p>&quot;Hush, for God&#x27;s sake!  It is the king!&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>
<p>AT THE PLAGUE-PIT.</p>
<p>The effect of the whisper was magical.  Everything that had been</p>
<p>dark before, became clear as noonday; and Sir Norman sat</p>
<p>absolutely astounded at his own stupidity in not having found it</p>
<p>out for himself before.  Every feature, notwithstanding the</p>
<p>disguise of wig and beard, became perfectly familiar; and even</p>
<p>through the well-assumed voice, he recognized the royal tones.</p>
<p>It struck him all at once, and with it the fact of Leoline&#x27;s</p>
<p>increased danger.  Count L&#x27;Estrange was a formidable rival, but</p>
<p>King Charles of England was even more formidable.</p>
<p>Thought is quick - quicker than the electric telegraph or balloon</p>
<p>traveling; and in two seconds the whole stated things, with all</p>
<p>the attendant surprises and dangers, danced before his mind&#x27;s eye</p>
<p>like a panorama; and he comprehended the past, the present, and</p>
<p>the future, before Hubert had uttered the last word of his</p>
<p>whisper.  He turned his eyes, with a very new and singular</p>
<p>sensation, upon the quondam count, and found that gentlemen</p>
<p>looking very hard at him, with, a preternaturally grave</p>
<p>expression of countenance.  Sir Norman knew well as anybody the</p>
<p>varying moods of his royal countship, and, notwithstanding his</p>
<p>general good nature, it was not safe to trifle with him at all</p>
<p>times; so he repressed every outward sign of emotion whatever,</p>
<p>and resolved to treat him as Count L&#x27;Estrange until he should</p>
<p>choose to sail under his own proper colors.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said the count, with unruffled eagerness, &quot;and so you</p>
<p>decline to go any further Sir Norman?&quot;</p>
<p>Hubert&#x27;s eye was fixed with a warning glance upon him, and Sir</p>
<p>Norman composedly answered</p>
<p>&quot;No, count; I do not absolutely decline; but before I do go any</p>
<p>further, I should like to know by what right do you bring all</p>
<p>these men here, and what are your intentions in so doing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if I refuse to answer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I refuse to move a step further in the business!&quot; said Sir</p>
<p>Norman, with decision.</p>
<p>&quot;And why, my good friend?  You surely can have no objection to</p>
<p>anything that can be done against highwaymen and cut-throats.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right!  I have no objections, but others may.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whom do you mean by others?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The king, for instance.  His gracious majesty is whimsical at</p>
<p>times; and who knows that he may take it into his royal head to</p>
<p>involve us somehow with them.  I know the adage, &#x27;put not your</p>
<p>trust in princes.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; said the count, with a slight and irrepressible</p>
<p>smile; &quot;your prudence is beyond all praise!  But I think, in this</p>
<p>matter I may safely promise to stand between you and the king&#x27;s</p>
<p>wrath.  Look at those horsemen beyond you, and see if they do not</p>
<p>wear the uniform of his majesty&#x27;s own body-guard.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman looked, and saw the dazzling of their splendid</p>
<p>equipments glancing and glistening in the moonbeams.</p>
<p>&quot;I see.  Then you have the royal permission for all this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have said it.  Now, most scrupulous of men, proceed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look there!&quot; exclaimed Hubert, suddenly pointing to a corner of</p>
<p>the rain.  &quot;Someone has seen us, and is going now to give the</p>
<p>alarm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He shall miss it, though!&quot; said Sir Norman, detecting, at the</p>
<p>same instant, a dark figure getting through the broken doorway;</p>
<p>and striking spurs into his horse, he was instantaneously beside</p>
<p>it, out of the saddle, and had grasped the retreater by the</p>
<p>shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;By your leave!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman.  &quot;Not quite so fast!</p>
<p>Stand out here in the moonlight, until I see who you are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me go!&quot; cried the man, grappling with his opponent.  &quot;I know</p>
<p>who you are, and I swear you&#x27;ll never see moonlight or sunlight</p>
<p>again, if you do not instantly let me go.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman recognized the voice with a perfect shout of delight.</p>
<p>&quot;The duke, by all that&#x27;s lucky! O, I&#x27;ll let you go: but not until</p>
<p>the hangman gets hold of you.  Villain and robber, you shall pay</p>
<p>for your misdeeds now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold!&quot; shouted the commanding voice of Count L&#x27;Estrange.</p>
<p>&quot;Cease, Sir Norman Kingsley! there is no time, and this is no</p>
<p>person for you to scoff with.  He is our prisoner, and shall show</p>
<p>us the nearest way into this den of thieves.  Give me your sword,</p>
<p>fellow, and be thankful I do not make you shorter by a head with</p>
<p>it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You do not know him!&quot; cried Sir Norman; in vivid excitement.  &quot;I</p>
<p>tell you this is the identical scoundrel who attempted to rob and</p>
<p>murder you a few hours ago.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So much the better!  He shall pay for that and all his other</p>
<p>shortcomings, before long!  But, in the meantime, I order him to</p>
<p>bring us before the rest of this outlawed crew.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall do nothing of the kind,&quot; said the duke, sullenly.</p>
<p>&quot;Just as you please.  Here, my men, two of you take hold of this</p>
<p>scoundrel, and dispatch him at once.&quot;</p>
<p>The guard had all dismounted; and two of them came forward with</p>
<p>edifying obedience, to do as they were told.</p>
<p>The effect upon the duke was miraculous.  Instantly he started</p>
<p>up, with an energy perfectly amazing:</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no!  I&#x27;ll do it!  Come this way, gentlemen, and I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>bring you direct into their midst.  O good Lord! whatever will</p>
<p>become of us?&quot;</p>
<p>This last frantic question was addressed to society in general,</p>
<p>but Sir Norman felt called upon to answer:</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s very easily told, my man.  If you and the rest of your</p>
<p>titled associates receive your deserts (as there is no doubt you</p>
<p>will) from the gracious hand of our sovereign lord, the king, the</p>
<p>strongest rope and highest gallows at Tyburn will be your</p>
<p>elevated destiny.&quot;</p>
<p>The duke groaned dismally, and would have come to a halt to beg</p>
<p>mercy on the spot, had not Hubert given him a probe in, the ribs</p>
<p>with the point of his dagger, that sent him on again, with a</p>
<p>distracted howl.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, this is a perfect Hades!&quot; said the count, as he stumbled</p>
<p>after, in the darkness.  &quot;Are you sure we are going right,</p>
<p>Kingsley&quot;</p>
<p>The inquiry was not unnatural, for the blackness was perfectly</p>
<p>Tartarian, and the soldiers behind were knocking their tall shins</p>
<p>against all sorts of obstacles as they groped blindly along,</p>
<p>invoking from them countless curses, not loud, but deep.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know whether we are or not,&quot; said Sir Norman</p>
<p>significantly; &quot;only, God help him if we&#x27;re not!  Where are you</p>
<p>taking us to, you black-looking bandit?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I give you my word of honor, gentlemen,&quot; said an imploring voice</p>
<p>in the darkness, &quot;that I&#x27;m leading you, by the nearest way, to</p>
<p>the Midnight Court.  All I ask ,of you in return is, that you</p>
<p>will let me enter before you; for if they find that I lead you</p>
<p>in, my life will not be worth a moment&#x27;s purchase.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As if it ever was worth it,&quot; said Sir Norman, contemptuously.</p>
<p>&quot;On with you, and be thankful I don&#x27;t save your companions the</p>
<p>trouble, by making an end of you where you stand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rush along, old fellow,&quot; suggested Hubert, giving him another</p>
<p>poke with his dagger, that drew forth a second doleful howl.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the darkness, Sir Norman discovered that they</p>
<p>were being led in a direction exactly opposite that by which he</p>
<p>had previously effected an entrance.  They were in the vault, he</p>
<p>knew, by the darkness, though they had descended no stair-case,</p>
<p>and he was just wondering if their guide was not meditating some</p>
<p>treachery by such a circuitous route, when suddenly a tumult of</p>
<p>voices, and uproar, and confusion, met his ear.  At the same</p>
<p>instant, their guide opened a door, revealing a dark passage,</p>
<p>illuminated by a few rays of light, and which Sir Norman</p>
<p>instantly recognized as that leading to the Black Chamber.  Here</p>
<p>again the duke paused, and turned round to them with a</p>
<p>wildly-imploring face.</p>
<p>&quot;Gentlemen, I do conjure you to let me enter before you do!  I</p>
<p>tell you they will murder me the very instant they discover I</p>
<p>have led you here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be a great pity!&quot; said the count; &quot;and the gallows</p>
<p>will be cheated of one of its brightest ornaments!  That is your</p>
<p>den of thieves, I suppose, from which all this uproar comes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is.  And as I have guided you safely to it, surely I deserve</p>
<p>this trifling boon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trifling, do you call it,&quot; interposed Sir Norman, &quot;to let you</p>
<p>make your escape, as you most assuredly will do the moment you</p>
<p>are out of our sight!  No, no; we are too old birds to be caught</p>
<p>with such chaff; and though the informer always gets off</p>
<p>scot-free, your services deserve no such boon; for we could have</p>
<p>found our way without your help!  On with you, Sir Robber; and if</p>
<p>your companions do kill you, console yourself with the thought</p>
<p>that they have only anticipated the executioner by a few days!&quot;</p>
<p>With a perfectly heart-rending groan, the unfortunate duke walked</p>
<p>on; but when they reached the archway directly before the room,</p>
<p>he came to an obstinate halt, and positively refused to go a step</p>
<p>farther.  It was death, anyway, and he resisted with the courage</p>
<p>of desperation, feeling he might as well die there as go in and</p>
<p>be assassinated by his confederates, and not even the persuasive</p>
<p>influence of Hubert&#x27;s dagger could prevail on him to budge an</p>
<p>inch farther.</p>
<p>&quot;Stay, then!&quot; said the count, with perfect indifference.  &quot;And,</p>
<p>soldiers, see that he does not escape!  Now, Kingsley, let us</p>
<p>just have a glimpse of what is going on within.&quot;</p>
<p>Though the party had made considerable noise in advancing, and</p>
<p>had spoken quite loudly in their little animated discussion with</p>
<p>the duke, so great was the turmoil and confusion within, that it</p>
<p>was not heeded, or even heard.  With very different feelings from</p>
<p>those with which he had stood there last, Sir Norman stepped</p>
<p>forward and stood beside the count, looking at the scene within.</p>
<p>The crimson court was in a state of &quot;most admired disorder,&quot; and</p>
<p>the confusion of tongues was equal to Babel.  No longer were they</p>
<p>languidly promenading, or lolling in the cushioned chairs; but</p>
<p>all seemed running to and fro in the wildest excitement, which</p>
<p>the grandest duke among them seemed to share equally with the</p>
<p>terrified white sylphs.  Everybody appeared to be talking</p>
<p>together, and paying no attention whatever to the sentiments of</p>
<p>their neighbors.  One universal centre of union alone seemed to</p>
<p>exist, and that was the green, judicial table near the throne,</p>
<p>upon which, while all tongues ran, all eyes turned.  For some</p>
<p>minutes, neither of the beholders could make out why, owing to</p>
<p>the crowd (principally of the ladies) pressing around it; but Sir</p>
<p>Norman guessed, and thrilled through with a vague sensation of</p>
<p>terror, lest it should prove to be the dead body of Miranda.</p>
<p>Skipping in and out among the females he saw the dwarf,</p>
<p>performing a sort of war dance of rage and frenzy; twining both</p>
<p>hands in his wig, as if he would have torn it out by the roots,</p>
<p>and anon tearing at somebody else&#x27;s wig, so that everybody backed</p>
<p>off when he came near them.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that little fiend?&quot; inquired the count; &quot;and what have</p>
<p>they got there at the and of the room, pray?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That little fiend is the ringleader here, and is entitled Prince</p>
<p>Caliban.  Regarding your other question,&quot; said Sir Norman, with a</p>
<p>faint thrill, &quot;there was a table there when I saw it last, but I</p>
<p>am afraid there is something worse now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could ever any mortal conceive of such a scene,&quot; observed the</p>
<p>count to himself; &quot;look at that little picture of ugliness; how</p>
<p>he hops about like a dropsical bull-frog.  Some of those women</p>
<p>are very pretty, too, and outshine more than one court-beauty</p>
<p>that I have seen.  Upon my word, it is the most extraordinary</p>
<p>spectacle I ever heard of.  I wonder what they&#x27;ve got that&#x27;s so</p>
<p>attractive down there?&quot;</p>
<p>At the same moment, a loud voice within the circle abruptly</p>
<p>exclaimed</p>
<p>&quot;She revives, she revives!  Back, back, and give her air!&quot;</p>
<p>Instantly, the throng swayed and fell back; and the dwarf, with a</p>
<p>sort of yell (whether of rage or relief, nobody knew), swept them</p>
<p>from side to side with a wave of his long arms, and cleared a</p>
<p>wide vacancy for his own especial benefit.  The action gave the</p>
<p>count an opportunity of gratifying his curiosity.  The object of</p>
<p>attraction was now plainly visible.  Sir Norman&#x27;s surmises had</p>
<p>been correct.  The green table of the parliament-house of the</p>
<p>midnight court had been converted, by the aid of cushions and</p>
<p>pillows, into an extempore couch.; and half-buried in their downy</p>
<p>depths lay Miranda, the queen.  The sweeping robe of royal</p>
<p>purple, trimmed with ermine, the circlets of jewels on arms,</p>
<p>bosom, and head, she still wore, and the beautiful face was</p>
<p>white: than fallen snow.  Yet she was not dead, as Sir Norman had</p>
<p>dreaded; for the dark eyes were open, and were fixed with an</p>
<p>unutterable depth of melancholy on vacancy.  Her arms lay</p>
<p>helplessly by her side, and someone, the court physician</p>
<p>probably, was bending over her and feeling her pulse.</p>
<p>As the count&#x27;s eyes fell upon her, he started back, and grasped</p>
<p>Sir Norman&#x27;s arm with consternation.</p>
<p>&quot;Good heavens, Kingsley!&quot; he cried; &quot;it is Leoline, herself!&quot;</p>
<p>In his excitement he had spoken so loud, that in the momentary</p>
<p>silence that followed the physician&#x27;s direction, his voice had</p>
<p>rung through the room, and drew every eye upon them.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seen, we are seen!&quot; shouted Hubert, and as he spoke, a</p>
<p>terrible cry idled the room.  In an instant every sword leaped</p>
<p>from its scabbard, and the shriek of the startled women rang</p>
<p>appallingly out on the air.  Sir Norman drew his sword, too; but</p>
<p>the count, with his eyes yet fixed on Miranda, still held him by</p>
<p>the arm, and excitedly exclaimed</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me, tell me, is it Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leoline!  No - how could it be Leoline?  They look alike, that&#x27;s</p>
<p>all.  Draw your sword, count, and defend yourself; we are</p>
<p>discovered, and they are upon us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are upon them, you mean, and it is they who are discovered,&quot;</p>
<p>said the count, doing as directed, and stepping boldly in.  &quot;A</p>
<p>pretty hornet&#x27;s next is this we have lit upon, if ever there was</p>
<p>one.&quot;</p>
<p>Side by side with the count, with a dauntless step and eye, Sir</p>
<p>Norman entered, too; and, at sight of him a burst of surprise and</p>
<p>fury rang from lip to lip.  There was a yell of &quot;Betrayed,</p>
<p>betrayed!&quot; and the dwarf, with a face so distorted by fiendish</p>
<p>fury that it was scarcely human, made a frenzied rush at him,</p>
<p>when the clear, commanding voice of the count rang like a bugle</p>
<p>blast through the assembly</p>
<p>&quot;Sheathe your swords, the whole of you, and yield yourselves</p>
<p>prisoners.  In the king&#x27;s name, I command you to surrender.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is no king here but I!&quot; screamed the dwarf, gnashing his</p>
<p>teeth, and fairly foaming with rage.  &quot;Die; traitor and spy!  You</p>
<p>have escaped me once, but your hour is come now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Allow me to differ from you,&quot; said Sir Norman, politely, as he</p>
<p>evaded the blindly-frantic lunge of the dwarf&#x27;s sword, and</p>
<p>inserted an inch or two of the point of his own in that enraged</p>
<p>little prince&#x27;s anatomy.  &quot;So far from my hour having come - if</p>
<p>you will take the trouble to reflect upon it - you will find it</p>
<p>is the reverse, and that my little friend&#x27;s brief and brilliant</p>
<p>career in rapidly drawing to a close.&quot;</p>
<p>At these bland remarks, and at the sharp thrust that accompanied</p>
<p>them, the dwarfs previous war-dance of anxiety was nothing to the</p>
<p>horn-pipe of exasperation he went through when Sir Norman ceased.</p>
<p>The blood was raining from his side, and from the point of his</p>
<p>adversary&#x27;s sword, as he withdrew it; and, maddened like a wild</p>
<p>beast at the sight of his own blood, he screeched, and foamed,</p>
<p>and kicked about his stout little legs, and gnashed his teeth,</p>
<p>and made grabs at his wig, and lashed the air with his sword, and</p>
<p>made such desperate pokes with it, at Sir Norman and everybody</p>
<p>else who came in his way, that, for the public good, the young</p>
<p>knight run him through the sword-arm, and, in spite of all his</p>
<p>distracted didos, captured him by the help of Hubert, and passed</p>
<p>him over to the soldiers to cheer and keep company with the duke.</p>
<p>This brisk little affair being over, Sir Norman had time to look</p>
<p>about him.  It had all passed in so short a space, and the dwarf</p>
<p>had been so desperately frantic, that the rest had paused</p>
<p>involuntarily, and were still looking on.  Missing the count, he</p>
<p>glanced around the room, and discovered him standing on Miranda&#x27;s</p>
<p>throne, looking over the company with the cool air of a</p>
<p>conqueror.  Miranda, aroused, as she very well might be by all</p>
<p>this screaming and fighting, had partly raised herself upon her</p>
<p>elbow, and was looking wildly about her.  As her eye fell on Sir</p>
<p>Norman, she sat fairly erect, with a cry of exultation and joy.</p>
<p>&quot;You have come, you have come, as I knew you would,&quot; she</p>
<p>excitedly cried, &quot;and the hour of retribution is at hand!&quot;</p>
<p>At the words of one who, a few moments before, they had supposed</p>
<p>to be dead, an awestruck silence fell; and the count, taking</p>
<p>advantage of it, waved his hand, and cried</p>
<p>&quot;Yield yourselves prisoners, I command you!  The royal guards are</p>
<p>without; and the first of you who offers the slightest resistance</p>
<p>will die like a dog!  Ho, guards I enter, and seize your</p>
<p>prisoners!&quot;</p>
<p>Quick as thought the room was full of soldiers! but the rest of</p>
<p>the order was easier said than obeyed.  The robbers, knowing</p>
<p>their doom was death, fought with the fury of desperation, and a</p>
<p>snort, wild, and terrible conflict ensued.  Foremost in the melee</p>
<p>was Sir Norman and the count; while Hubert, who had taken</p>
<p>possession of the dwarf&#x27;s sword, fought like a young lion.  The</p>
<p>shrieks of the women were heart-rending, as they all fled,</p>
<p>precipitately, into the blue dining-room; and, crouching in</p>
<p>corners, or flying distractedly about - true to their sex - made</p>
<p>the air resound with the most lamentable cries.  Some five or</p>
<p>six, braver than the rest, alone remained; and more than one of</p>
<p>these actually mixed in the affray, with a heroism worthy a</p>
<p>better cause.  Miranda, still sitting erect, and supported in the</p>
<p>arms of a kneeling and trembling sylph in white, watched the</p>
<p>conflict with terribly-exultant eyes, that blazed brighter and</p>
<p>brighter with the lurid fire of vengeful joy st every robber that</p>
<p>fell.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that I were strong enough to wield a sword!&quot; was her fierce</p>
<p>aspiration every instant; &quot;if I could only mix in that battle for</p>
<p>five minutes, I could die with a happy heart!&quot;</p>
<p>Had she been able to wield a sword for five minutes, according to</p>
<p>her wish, she would probably have wielded it from beginning to</p>
<p>end of the battle; for it did not last much longer than that.</p>
<p>The robbers fought with fury and ferocity; but they had been</p>
<p>taken by surprise, and were overpowered by numbers, and obliged</p>
<p>to yield.</p>
<p>The crimson court was indeed crimson now; for the velvet</p>
<p>carpeting was dyed a more terrible red, and was slippery with a</p>
<p>rain of blood!  A score of dead and dying lay groaning on the</p>
<p>ground; and the rest, beaten and bloody, gave up their swords and</p>
<p>surrendered.</p>
<p>&quot;You should have done this at first!&quot; said the count, coolly</p>
<p>wiping his blood-stained weapon, end replacing it in its sheath;</p>
<p>&quot;and, by so doing, saved some time and more bloodshed.  Where are</p>
<p>all the fair ladies, Kingsley, I saw here when we entered first?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They fled like a flock of frightened deer,&quot; said Hubert, taking</p>
<p>it upon himself to answer,&quot;through yonder archway when the fight</p>
<p>commenced.  I will go in search of them if you like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am rather at a loss what to do with them,&quot; said the count,</p>
<p>half-laughing.  &quot;It would be a pity to bring such a cavalcade of</p>
<p>pretty women into the city to die of the plague.  Can you suggest</p>
<p>nothing, Sir Norman?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing, but to leave then here to take care of themselves, or</p>
<p>let them go free.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They would be a great addition to the court at Whitehall,&quot;</p>
<p>suggested Hubert, in his prettiest tone, &quot;and a thousand times</p>
<p>handsomer than half the damsels therein.  There, for instance, is</p>
<p>one a dozen timer more beautiful than Mistress Stuart herself!&quot;</p>
<p>Leaning, in his nonchalant way, on the hilt of his sword, he</p>
<p>pointed to Miranda, whose fiercely-joyful eyes were fixed w with</p>
<p>a glance that made the three of them shudder, on the bloody floor</p>
<p>and the heap of slain.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; asked the count, curiously.  &quot;Why is she perched</p>
<p>up there, and why does she bear such an extraordinary resemblance</p>
<p>to Leoline?  Do you know anything about her, Kingsley?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know she is the wife of that unlovely little man, whose howls</p>
<p>in yonder passage you can hear, if you listen, and that she was</p>
<p>the queen of this midnight court, and is wounded, if not dying,</p>
<p>now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never saw such fierce eyes before in a female head!  One would</p>
<p>think she fairly exulted in this wholesale slaughter of her</p>
<p>subjects.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So she does; and she hates both her husband and her subjects,</p>
<p>with an intensity you cannot conceive.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How very like royalty!&quot; observed Hubert, in parenthesis.  &quot;If</p>
<p>she were a real queen, she could not act more naturally.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman smiled, and the count glanced at the audacious page,</p>
<p>suspiciously; but Hubert&#x27;s face was touching to witness, in its</p>
<p>innocent unconsciousness.  Miranda, looking up at the same time,</p>
<p>caught the young knight&#x27;s eye, and made a motion for him to</p>
<p>approach.  She held out both her hands to him as he came near,</p>
<p>with the same look of dreadful delight.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Norman Kingsley, I am dying, and my last words are in</p>
<p>thanksgiving to you for having thus avenged me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me hope you have many days to live yet, fair lady,&quot; said Sir</p>
<p>Norman, with the same feeling of repulsion he had experienced in</p>
<p>the dungeon.  &quot;I am sorry you have been obliged to witness this</p>
<p>terrible scene.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry!&quot; she cried, fiercely.  &quot;Why, since the first hour I</p>
<p>remember at all, I remember nothing that has given me such joy as</p>
<p>what has passed now; my only regret is that I did not see them</p>
<p>all die before my eyes!  Sorry!  I tell you I would not have</p>
<p>missed it for ten thousand worlds!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, you must not talk like this!&quot; said Sir Norman, almost</p>
<p>sternly.  &quot;Heaven forbid there should exist a woman who could</p>
<p>rejoice in bloodshed and death.  You do not, I know.  You wrong</p>
<p>yourself and your own nature in saying so.  Be calm, now; do not</p>
<p>excite yourself.  You shall come with us, and be properly cared</p>
<p>for; and I feel certain you have a long and happy life before you</p>
<p>yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are those men?&quot; she said, not heeding him, &quot;and who - ah,</p>
<p>great Heaven!  What is that?&quot;</p>
<p>In looking round, she had met Hubert face to face.  She knew that</p>
<p>that face was her own; and, with a horror stamped on every</p>
<p>feature that no words can depict, she fell back, with a terrible</p>
<p>scream and was dead!</p>
<p>Sir Norman was so shocked by the suddenness of the last</p>
<p>catastrophe, that, for some time, he could not realize that she</p>
<p>had actually expired, until he bent over her, and placed his ear</p>
<p>to her lips.  No breath was there; no pulse stirred in that</p>
<p>fierce heart - the Midnight Queen was indeed dead!</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, this is fearful!&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, pale and horrified.</p>
<p>&quot;The sight of Hubert, and his wonderful resemblance to her, has</p>
<p>completed what her wound and this excitement began.  Her last is</p>
<p>breathed on earth!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Peace be with her!&quot; said the count, removing his hat, which, up</p>
<p>to the present, he had worn.  &quot;And now, Sir Norman, if we are to</p>
<p>keep our engagement at sunrise, we had better be on the move;</p>
<p>for, unless I am greatly mistaken, the sky is already grey with</p>
<p>day-dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are your commands?&quot; asked Sir Norman, turning away, with a</p>
<p>sigh, from the beautiful form already stiffening in death.</p>
<p>&quot;That you come with me to seek out those frightened fair ones,</p>
<p>who are a great deal too lovely to share the fate of their male</p>
<p>companions.  I shall give them their liberty to go where they</p>
<p>please, on condition that they do not enter the city.  We have</p>
<p>enough vile of their class there already.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman silently followed him into the azure and silver</p>
<p>saloon, where the crowd of duchesses and countesses were &quot;weeping</p>
<p>and wringing their hands,&quot; and as white as so many pretty ghosts.</p>
<p>In a somewhat brief and forcible manner, considering his</p>
<p>characteristic gallantry, the count made his proposal, which,</p>
<p>with feelings of pleasure and relief, was at once acceded to; and</p>
<p>the two gentlemen bowed themselves out, and left the startled</p>
<p>ladies.</p>
<p>On returning to the crimson court, he commanded a number of his</p>
<p>soldiers to remain and bury the dead, and assist the wounded; and</p>
<p>then, followed by the remainder and the prisoners under their</p>
<p>charge, passed out, and were soon from the heated atmosphere in</p>
<p>the cool morning air.  The moon was still serenely shining, but</p>
<p>the stars that kept the earliest hours were setting, and the</p>
<p>eastern sky was growing light with the hazy gray of coming morn.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you day-dawn was at hand,&quot; said the count, as he sprang</p>
<p>into his saddle; &quot;and, lo! in the sky it is gray already.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is time for it!&quot; said Sir Norman, as he, too, got into his</p>
<p>seat; &quot;this has been the longest night I have ever known, and the</p>
<p>most eventful one of my life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the end is not yet!  Leoline waits to decide between us!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;True!  But I have little doubt what that decision will be!  I</p>
<p>presume you will have to deliver up your prisoners before you can</p>
<p>visit her, and I will avail myself of the opportunity to snatch a</p>
<p>few moments to fulfill a melancholy duty of my own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As you please.  I have no objection; but in that case you will</p>
<p>need some one to guide you to the place of rendezvous; so I will</p>
<p>order my private attendant, yonder, to keep you in sight, and</p>
<p>guide you to me when your business is ended.&quot;</p>
<p>The count had given the order to start, the moment they had left</p>
<p>the ruin, and the conversation had been carried on while riding</p>
<p>at a break-neck gallop.  Sir Norman thanked him for his offer,</p>
<p>and they rode in silence until they reached the city, and their</p>
<p>paths diverged; Sir Norman&#x27;s leading to the apothecary&#x27;s shop</p>
<p>where be had left Ormiston, and the count&#x27;s leading - he best</p>
<p>knew where.  George - the attendant referred to - joined the</p>
<p>knight, and leaving his horse in his care, Sir Norman entered the</p>
<p>shop, and encountered the spectral proprietor at the door.</p>
<p>&quot;What of my friend?&quot; was his eager inquiry.  &quot;Has he yet shown</p>
<p>signs of returning consciousness?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas, no!&quot; replied the apothecary, with a groan, that came</p>
<p>wailing up like a whistle; &quot;he was so excessively dead, that</p>
<p>there was no use keeping him; and as the room was wanted for</p>
<p>other purposes, I - pray, my dear sir, don&#x27;t look so violent - I</p>
<p>put him in the pest-cart and had him buried.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the plague-pit!&quot; shouted Sir Norman, making a spring at him;</p>
<p>but the man darted off like a ghostly flash into the inner room,</p>
<p>and closed and bolted the door in a twinkling.</p>
<p>Sir Norman kicked at it spitefully, but it resisted his every</p>
<p>effort; and, overcoming a strong temptation to smash every bottle</p>
<p>in the shop, he sprang once more into the saddle, and rode off to</p>
<p>the plague-pit.  It was the second time within the last twelve</p>
<p>hours he had stood there; and, on the previous occasion, he who</p>
<p>now lay in it, had stood by his side.  He looked down, sickened</p>
<p>and horror-struck.  Perhaps, before another morning, he, too,</p>
<p>might be there; and, feeling his blood run cold at the thought,</p>
<p>he was turning away, when some one came rapidly up, and sank down</p>
<p>with a moaning gasping cry on its very edge.  That shape - tall</p>
<p>and slender, and graceful - he well knew; and, leaning over her,</p>
<p>ho laid his hand on her shoulder, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&quot;La Masque!&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER, XXI.</p>
<p>WHAT WAS BEHIND TWO MASK.</p>
<p>The cowering form rose up; but, seeing who it was, sank down</p>
<p>again, with its face groveling in the dust, and with another</p>
<p>prolonged, moaning cry.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame Masque!&quot; he said, wonderingly; &quot;what is this?&quot;</p>
<p>He bent to raise her; but, with a sort of scream she held out her</p>
<p>arms to keep him back.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, no I Touch me not!  Hate me - kill me!  I have murdered</p>
<p>your friend!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman recoiled as if from a deadly tent.</p>
<p>&quot;Murdered him!  Madame, in Heaven&#x27;s name, what have you said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I have not stabbed him, or poisoned him, or shot him; but I</p>
<p>am his murderer, nevertheless!&quot; she wailed, writhing in a sort of</p>
<p>gnawing inward torture.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, I do not understand you at all!  Surely you are raving</p>
<p>when you talk like this.&quot;</p>
<p>Still moaning on the edge of the plague-pit, she half rose up,</p>
<p>with both hands clasped tightly over her heart, as if she would</p>
<p>have held back from all human ken the anguish that was destroying</p>
<p>her</p>
<p>&quot;NO - no!  I am not mad - pray Heaven I were!  Oh, that they had</p>
<p>strangled me in the first hour of my birth, as they would a</p>
<p>viper, rather than I should have lived through all this life of</p>
<p>misery and guilt, to end it by this last, worst crime of all!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman stood and looked at her still with a dazed expression.</p>
<p>He knew well enough whose murderer she called herself; but why</p>
<p>she did so, or how she could possibly bring about his death, was</p>
<p>a mystery altogether too deep for him to solve.</p>
<p>&quot;Madame, compose yourself, I beseech you, and tell me what you</p>
<p>mean.  It is to my friend, Ormiston, you allude - is it not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes - yes! surely you need not ask.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know that he is dead, and buried in this horrible place; but</p>
<p>why you should accuse yourself of murdering him, I confess I do</p>
<p>not know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you shall!&quot; she cried, passionately.  &quot;And you will wonder</p>
<p>at it no longer!  You are the last one to whom the revelation can</p>
<p>ever be made on earth; and, now that my hours are numbered, it</p>
<p>matters little whether it is told or not!  Was it not you who</p>
<p>first found him dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was I - yes.  And how he came to his end, I have been</p>
<p>puzzling myself in vain to discover ever since.&quot;</p>
<p>She rose up, drew herself to her full majestic height, and looked</p>
<p>at him with a terrible glance</p>
<p>&quot;Shall I tell you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have had no hand in it,&quot; he answered, with a cold chill at</p>
<p>the tone and look, &quot;for he loved you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have had a hand in it - I alone have been the cause of it.</p>
<p>But for me he would be living still!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Madame,&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, in horror.</p>
<p>&quot;You need not look as if you thought me mad, for I tell you it is</p>
<p>Heaven&#x27;s truth!  You say right - he loved me; but for that love</p>
<p>he would be living now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You speak in riddles which I cannot read.  How could that love</p>
<p>have caused his death, since his dearest wishes were to be</p>
<p>granted to-night?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He told you that, did he?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He did.  He told me you were to remove your mask; and if, on</p>
<p>seeing you, he still loved you, you were to be his wife.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then woe to him for ever having extorted such a promise from me!</p>
<p>Oh, I warned him again, and again, and again.  I told him how it</p>
<p>would be - I begged him to desist; but no, he was blind, he was</p>
<p>mad; he would rush on his own doom!  I fulfilled my promise, and</p>
<p>behold the result!&quot;</p>
<p>She pointed with a frantic gesture to the plague-pit, and wrung</p>
<p>her beautiful hands with the same moaning of anguish.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I hear aright?&quot; said Sir Norman, looking at her, and really</p>
<p>doubting if his ears had not deceived him.  &quot;Do you mean to say</p>
<p>that, in keeping your word and showing him your face, you have</p>
<p>caused his death?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do.  I had warned him of it before.  I told him there were</p>
<p>sights too horrible to look on and live, but nothing would</p>
<p>convince him!  Oh, why was the curse of life ever bestowed upon</p>
<p>such a hideous thing as I!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman gazed at her in a state of hopeless bewilderment.  He</p>
<p>had thought, from the moment he saw her first, that there was</p>
<p>something wrong with her brain, to make her act in such a</p>
<p>mysterious, eccentric sort of way; but he had never positively</p>
<p>thought her so far gone as this.  In his own mind, he set her</p>
<p>down, now, as being mad as a March hare, and accordingly answered</p>
<p>in that soothing tone people use to imbeciles</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Madame Masque, pray do not excite yourself, or say such</p>
<p>dreadful things.  I am sure you would not willfully cause the</p>
<p>death of any one, much less that of one who loved you as he did.&quot;</p>
<p>La Masque broke into a wild laugh, almost worse to hear than her</p>
<p>former despairing moans.</p>
<p>&quot;The man thinks me mad!  He will not believe, unless he sees and</p>
<p>knows for himself!  Perhaps you, too, Sir Norman Kingsley,&quot; she</p>
<p>cried, changing into sudden fierceness, &quot;would like to see the</p>
<p>face behind this mask? - would like to see what has slain your</p>
<p>friend, and share his fate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Sir Norman.  &quot;I should like to see it; and I</p>
<p>think I may safely promise not to die from the effects.  But</p>
<p>surely, madame, you deceive yourself; no face, however ugly -</p>
<p>even supposing you to possess such a one - could produce such</p>
<p>dismay as to cause death.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shall see.&quot;</p>
<p>She was looking down into the plague-pit, standing so close to</p>
<p>its cracking edge, that Sir Norman&#x27;s blood ran cold, in the</p>
<p>momentary expectation to see her slip and fall headlong in.  Her</p>
<p>voice was less fierce and less wild, but her hands were still</p>
<p>clasped tightly over her heart, as if to ease the unutterable</p>
<p>pain there.  Suddenly, she looked up, and said, in an altered</p>
<p>tone:</p>
<p>&quot;You have lost Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And found her again.  She is in the power of one Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And if in his power, pray, how have you found her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because we are both to meet in her presence within this very</p>
<p>hour, and she is to decide between us,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has Count L&#x27;Estrange promised you this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He has.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you have no doubt what her decision will be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not the slightest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How came you to know she was carried off by this count?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He confessed it himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Voluntarily?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; I taxed him with it, and he owned to the deed; but he</p>
<p>voluntarily promised to take me to her and abide by her</p>
<p>decision.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Extraordinary!&quot; said La Masque, as if to herself.  &quot;Whimsical as</p>
<p>he is, I scarcely expected he would give her up no easily as</p>
<p>this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you know him, madame?&quot; said Sir Norman, pointedly.</p>
<p>&quot;There are few things I do not know, and rare are the disguises I</p>
<p>cannot penetrate.  So you have discovered it, too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, madame, my eyes were not sharp enough, nor had I sufficient</p>
<p>cleverness, even, for that.  It was Hubert, the Earl of</p>
<p>Rochester&#x27;s page, who told me who he was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, the page!&quot; said La Masque, quickly.  &quot;You have then been</p>
<p>speaking to him?  What do you think of his resemblance to</p>
<p>Leoline?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it is the most astonishing resemblance I ever saw.  But</p>
<p>he is not the only one who bears Leoline&#x27;s face.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the other is?&quot;</p>
<p>The other is she whom you sent me to see in the old ruins.</p>
<p>Madame, I wish you would tell me the secret of this wonderful</p>
<p>likeness; for I am certain you know, and I am equally certain it</p>
<p>is not accidental.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are right.  Leoline knows already; for, with the</p>
<p>presentiment that my end was near, I visited her when you left,</p>
<p>and gave her her whole history, in writing.  The explanation is</p>
<p>simple enough.  Leoline, Miranda, and Hubert, are sisters and</p>
<p>brother.&quot;</p>
<p>Some misty idea that such was the case had been struggling</p>
<p>through Sir Norman&#x27;s slow mind, unformed and without shape, ever</p>
<p>since he had seen the trio, therefore he was not the least</p>
<p>astonished when he heard the fact announced.  Only in one thing</p>
<p>he was a little disappointed.</p>
<p>&quot;Then Hubert is really a boy?&quot; he said, half dejectedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly he is.  What did you take him to be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, I thought - that is, I do not know,&quot; said Sir Norman, quite</p>
<p>blushing at being guilty of so much romance, &quot;but that he was a</p>
<p>woman in disguise.  You see he is so handsome, and looks so much</p>
<p>like Leoline, that I could not help thinking so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is Leoline&#x27;s twin brother - that accounts for it.  When does</p>
<p>she become your wife?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This very morning, God willing!&quot; raid Sir Norman, fervently.</p>
<p>&quot;Amen!  And may her life and yours be long and happy.  What</p>
<p>becomes of the rest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since Hubert is her brother, he shall come with us, if he will.</p>
<p>As for the other, she, alas! is dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dead!&quot; cried La Masque.  &quot;How?  When?  She was living, tonight!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True! She died of a wound.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A wound?  Surely not given by the dwarfs hand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no; it was quite accidental.  But since you know so much of</p>
<p>the dwarf, perhaps you also know he is now the king&#x27;s prisoner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not know it; but I surmised as much when I discovered that</p>
<p>you and Count L&#x27;Estrange, followed by such a body of men, visited</p>
<p>the ruin.  Well, his career has been long and dark enough, and</p>
<p>even the plague seemed to spare him for the executioner.  And so</p>
<p>the poor mock-queen is dead?  Well, her sister will not long</p>
<p>survive her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good Heavens, madame!&quot; cried Sir Norman, aghast.  &quot;You do not</p>
<p>mean to say that Leoline is going to die?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no!  I hope Leoline has a long and happy life before her.</p>
<p>But the wretched, guilty sister I mean is, myself; for I, too,</p>
<p>Sir Norman, am her sister.&quot;</p>
<p>At this new disclosure, Sir Norman stood perfectly petrified; and</p>
<p>La Masque, looking down at the dreadful place at her feet, went</p>
<p>rapidly on:</p>
<p>&quot;Alas and alas! that it should be so; but it is the direful</p>
<p>truth.  We bear the same name, we had the same father; and yet I</p>
<p>have been the curse and bane of their lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Leoline knows this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She never knew it until this night, or any one else alive; and</p>
<p>no one should know it now, were not my ghastly life ending.  I</p>
<p>prayed her to forgive me for the wrong I have done her; and she</p>
<p>may, for she is gentle and good - but when, when shall I be able</p>
<p>to forgive myself?&quot;</p>
<p>The sharp pain in her voice jarred on Sir Norman&#x27;s ear and heart;</p>
<p>and, to get rid of its dreary echo, he hurriedly asked:</p>
<p>&quot;You say you bear the same name.  May I ask what name that is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is one, Sir Norman Kingsley, before which your own ancient</p>
<p>title pales.  We are Montmorencis, and in our veins runs the</p>
<p>proudest blood in France.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then Leoline is French and of noble birth?&quot; said Sir Norman,</p>
<p>with a thrill of pleasure.  &quot;I loved her for herself alone, and</p>
<p>would have wedded her had she been the child of a beggar; but I</p>
<p>rejoice to hear this nevertheless.  Her father, then, bore a</p>
<p>title?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her father was the Marquis de Montmorenci.  but Leoline&#x27;s mother</p>
<p>and mine were not the same - had they been, the lives of all four</p>
<p>might have been very different; but it is too late to lament that</p>
<p>now.  My mother had no gentle blood in her veins, as Leoline&#x27;s</p>
<p>had, for she was but a fisherman&#x27;s daughter, torn from her home,</p>
<p>and married by force.  Neither did she love my father</p>
<p>notwithstanding his youth, rank, and passionate love for her, for</p>
<p>she was betrothed to another bourgeois, like herself.  For his</p>
<p>sake she refused even the title of marchioness, offered her in</p>
<p>the moment of youthful and ardent passion, and clung, with</p>
<p>deathless truth, to her fisher-lover.  The blood of the</p>
<p>Montmorencis is fierce and hot, and brooks no opposition&quot; (Sir</p>
<p>Norman thought of Miranda, and inwardly owned that that was a</p>
<p>fact); &quot;and the marquis, in his jealous wrath, both hated and</p>
<p>loved her at the same time, and vowed deadly vengeance against</p>
<p>her bourgeois lover.  That vow he kept.  The young fisherman was</p>
<p>found one morning at his lady-love&#x27;s door without a head, and the</p>
<p>bleeding trunk told no tales.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, for a while, she was distracted and so on; but when</p>
<p>the first shock of her grief was over, my father carried her off,</p>
<p>and forcibly made her his wife.  Fierce hatred, I told you, was</p>
<p>mingled with his fierce love, and before the honeymoon was over</p>
<p>it began to break out.  One night, in a fit of jealous passion,</p>
<p>to which he was addicted, he led her into a room she had never</p>
<p>before been permitted to enter; showed her a grinning human</p>
<p>skull, and told her it was her lover&#x27;s!  In his cruel exultation,</p>
<p>he confessed all; how he had caused him to be murdered; his head</p>
<p>severed from the body; and brought here to punish her, some day,</p>
<p>for her obstinate refusal to love him.</p>
<p>&quot;Up to this time she had been quiet and passive, bearing her fate</p>
<p>with a sort of dumb resignation; but now a spirit of vengeance,</p>
<p>fiercer and more terrible than his own, began to kindle within</p>
<p>her; and, kneeling down before the ghastly thing, she breathed a</p>
<p>wish - a prayer - to the avenging Jehovah, so unutterably</p>
<p>horrible, that even her husband had to fly with curdling blood</p>
<p>from the room.  That dreadful prayer was heard - that wish</p>
<p>fulfilled in me; but long before I looked on the light of day</p>
<p>that frantic woman had repented of the awful deed she had done.</p>
<p>Repentance came too late the sin of the father was visited on the</p>
<p>child, and on the mother, too, for the moment her eyes fell upon</p>
<p>me, she became a raving maniac, and died before the first day of</p>
<p>my life had ended.</p>
<p>&quot;Nurse and physician fled at the sight of me; but my father,</p>
<p>though thrilling with horror, bore the shock, and bowed to the</p>
<p>retributive justice of the angry Deity she had invoked.  His</p>
<p>whole life, his whole nature, changed from that hour; and,</p>
<p>kneeling beside my dead mother, as he afterward told me, he vowed</p>
<p>before high Heaven to cherish and love me, even as though I had</p>
<p>not been the ghastly creature I was.  The physician he bound by a</p>
<p>terrible oath to silence; the nurse he forced back, and, in spite</p>
<p>of her disgust and abhorrence, compelled her to nurse and care</p>
<p>for me.  The dead was buried out of sight; and we had rooms in a</p>
<p>distant part of the house, which no one ever entered but my</p>
<p>father and the nurse.  Though set apart from my birth as</p>
<p>something accursed, I had the intellect and capacity of - yes,</p>
<p>far greater intellect and capacity than, most children; and, as</p>
<p>years passed by, my father, true to his vow, became himself my</p>
<p>tutor and companion.  He did not love me - that was an utter</p>
<p>impossibility; but time so blunts the edge of all things, that</p>
<p>even the nurse became reconciled to me, and my father could</p>
<p>scarcely do less than a stranger.  So I was cared for, and</p>
<p>instructed, and educated; and, knowing not what a monstrosity I</p>
<p>was, I loved them both ardently, and lived on happily enough, in</p>
<p>my splendid prison, for my first ten years in this world.</p>
<p>&quot;Then came a change.  My nurse died; and it became clear that I</p>
<p>must quit my solitary life, and see the sort of world I lived in.</p>
<p>So my father, seeing all this, sat down in the twilight one night</p>
<p>beside me, and told me the story of my own hideousness.  I was</p>
<p>but a child then, and it is many and many years ago; but this</p>
<p>gray summer morning, I feel what I felt then, as vividly as I did</p>
<p>at the time.  I had not learned the great lesson of life then -</p>
<p>endurance, I have scarcely learned it yet, or I should bear</p>
<p>life&#x27;s burden longer; but that first night&#x27;s despair has darkened</p>
<p>my whole after-life.  For weeks I would not listen to my father&#x27;s</p>
<p>proposal, to hide what would send all the world from me in</p>
<p>loathing behind a mask; but I came to my senses at last, and from</p>
<p>that day to the present - more days than either you or I would</p>
<p>care to count - it has not been one hour altogether off my face.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was the wonder and talk of Paris, when I did appear; and most</p>
<p>of the surmises were wild and wide of the mark - some even going</p>
<p>so far as to say it was all owing to my wonderful unheard-of</p>
<p>beauty that I was thus mysteriously concealed from view.  I had a</p>
<p>soft voice, and a tolerable shape; and upon this, I presume, they</p>
<p>founded the affirmation.  But my father and I kept our own</p>
<p>council, and let them say what they listed.  I had never been</p>
<p>named, as other children are; but they called me La Masque now.</p>
<p>I had masters and professors without end, and studied astronomy</p>
<p>and astrology, and the mystic lore of the old Egyptians, and</p>
<p>became noted as a prodigy and a wonder, and a miracle of</p>
<p>learning, far and near.</p>
<p>&quot;The arts used to discover the mystery and make me unmask were</p>
<p>innumerable and almost incredible; but I baffled them all, and</p>
<p>began, after a time, rather to enjoy the sensation I created than</p>
<p>otherwise.</p>
<p>&quot;There was one, in particular, possessed of even more devouring</p>
<p>curiosity than the rest, a certain young countess of miraculous</p>
<p>beauty, whom I need not describe, since you have her very image</p>
<p>in Leoline.  The Marquis de Montmorenci, of a somewhat</p>
<p>inflammable nature, loved her almost as much as he had done my</p>
<p>mother, and she accepted him, and they were married.  She may</p>
<p>have loved him (I see no reason why she should not), but still to</p>
<p>this day I think it was more to discover the secret of La Masque</p>
<p>than from any other cause.  I loved my beautiful new mother too</p>
<p>well to let her find it out; although from the day she entered</p>
<p>our house as a bride, until that on which she lay on her</p>
<p>deathbed, her whole aim, day and night, was its discovery.  There</p>
<p>seemed to be a fatality about my father&#x27;s wives; for the</p>
<p>beautiful Honorine lived scarcely longer than her predecessor,</p>
<p>and she died, leaving three children - all born at one time - you</p>
<p>know them well, and one of them you love.  To my care she</p>
<p>intrusted them on her deathbed, and she could have scarcely</p>
<p>intrusted them to worse; for, though I liked her, I most</p>
<p>decidedly disliked them.  They were lovely children - their</p>
<p>lovely mother&#x27;s image; and they were named Hubert, Leoline, and</p>
<p>Honorine, or, as you knew her, Miranda.  Even my father did not</p>
<p>seem to care for them much, not even as much as he cared for me;</p>
<p>and when he lay on his deathbed, one year later, I was left,</p>
<p>young as I was, their sole guardian, and trustee of all his</p>
<p>wealth.  That wealth was not fairly divided - one-half being left</p>
<p>to me and the other half to be shared equally between them; but,</p>
<p>in my wicked ambition, I was not satisfied even with that.  Some</p>
<p>of my father&#x27;s fierce and cruel nature I inherited; and I</p>
<p>resolved to be clear of these three stumbling-blocks, and</p>
<p>recompense myself for my other misfortunes by every indulgence</p>
<p>boundless riches could bestow.  So, secretly, and in the night, I</p>
<p>left my home, with an old and trusty servant, known to you as</p>
<p>Prudence, and my unfortunate, little brother and sisters.</p>
<p>Strange to say, Prudence was attached to one of them, and to</p>
<p>neither of the rest - that one was Leoline, whom she resolved to</p>
<p>keep and care for, and neither she nor I minded what became of</p>
<p>the other two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From Paris we went to Dijon, where we dropped Hubert into the</p>
<p>turn at the convent door, with his name attached, and left him</p>
<p>where he would be well taken care of, and no questions asked.</p>
<p>With the other two we started for Calais, en route for England;</p>
<p>and there Prudence got rid of Honorine in a singular manner.  A</p>
<p>packet was about starting for the island of our destination, and</p>
<p>she saw a strange-looking little man carrying his luggage from</p>
<p>the wharf into a boat.  She had the infant in her arms, having</p>
<p>carried it out for the identical purpose of getting rid of it;</p>
<p>and, without more ado, she laid it down, unseen, among boxes and</p>
<p>bundles, and, like Hagar, stood afar off to see what became of</p>
<p>it.  That ugly little man was the dwarf; and his amazement on</p>
<p>finding it among his goods and chattels you may imagine; but he</p>
<p>kept it, notwithstanding, though why, is best known to himself.</p>
<p>A few weeks after that we, too, came over, and Prudence took up</p>
<p>her residence in a quiet village a long way from London.  Thus</p>
<p>you see, Sir Norman, how it comes about that we are so related,</p>
<p>and the wrong I have done them all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have, indeed!&quot; said Sir Norman, gravely, having listened,</p>
<p>much shocked and displeased, at this open confession; &quot;and to one</p>
<p>of them it is beyond our power to atone.  Do you know the life of</p>
<p>misery to which she has been assigned?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know it all, and have repented for it in my own heart, in dust</p>
<p>and ashes!  Even I - unlike all other earthly creatures as I am -</p>
<p>have a conscience, and it has given me no rest night or day</p>
<p>since.  From that hour I have never lost sight of them; every</p>
<p>sorrow they have undergone has been known to me, and added to my</p>
<p>own; and yet I could not, or would not, undo what I had done.</p>
<p>Leoline knows all now; and she will tell Hubert, since destiny</p>
<p>has brought them together; and whether they will forgive me I</p>
<p>know not.  But yet they might; for they have long and happy lives</p>
<p>before them, and we can forgive everything to the dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you are not dead,&quot; said Sir Norman; &quot;and there is repentance</p>
<p>and pardon for all.  Much as you have wronged them, they will</p>
<p>forgive you; and Heaven is not less merciful than they!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They may; for I have striven to atone.  In my house there are</p>
<p>proofs and papers that will put them in possession of all, and</p>
<p>more than all, they have lost.    But life is a burden of torture</p>
<p>I will bear no longer.  The death of him who died for me this</p>
<p>night is the crowning tragedy of my miserable life; and if my</p>
<p>hour were not at hand, I should not have told you this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you have not told me the fearful cause of no much guilt and</p>
<p>suffering.  What is behind that mask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Would you, too, see?&quot; she asked, in a terrible voice, &quot;and die?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have told you it is not in my nature to die easily, and it is</p>
<p>something far stronger than mere curiosity makes me ask.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be it so!  The sky is growing red with day-dawn, and I shall</p>
<p>never see the sun rise more, for I am already plague-struck!&quot;</p>
<p>That sweetest of all voices ceased.  The white hands removed the</p>
<p>mask, and the floating coils of hair, and revealed, to Sir</p>
<p>Norman&#x27;s horror-struck gaze, the grisly face and head, and the</p>
<p>hollow eye-sockets, the grinning mouth, and fleshless cheeks of a</p>
<p>skeleton!</p>
<p>He saw it but for one fearful instant - the next, she had thrown</p>
<p>up both arms, and leaped headlong into the loathly plague-pit.</p>
<p>He saw her for a second or two, heaving and writhing in the</p>
<p>putrid heap; and then the strong man reeled and fell with his</p>
<p>face on the ground, not feigning, but sick unto death.  Of all</p>
<p>the dreadful things he had witnessed that night, there was</p>
<p>nothing so dreadful as this; of all the horror he had felt</p>
<p>before, there was none to equal what he felt now.  In his</p>
<p>momentary delirium, it seemed to him she was reaching her arms of</p>
<p>bone up to drag him in, and that the skeleton-face was grinning</p>
<p>at him on the edge of the awful pit.  And, covering his eyes with</p>
<p>his hands, he sprang up, and fled away.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>
<p>DAY-DAWN.</p>
<p>All this time, the attendant, George, had been sitting, very much</p>
<p>at his ease, on horseback, looking after Sir Norman&#x27;s charger and</p>
<p>admiring the beauties of sunrise.  He had seen Sir Norman in</p>
<p>conversation with a strange female, and not much liking his near</p>
<p>proximity to the plague-pit, was rather impatient for it to come</p>
<p>to an end; but when he saw the tragic manner in which it did end,</p>
<p>his consternation was beyond all bounds.  Sir Norman, in his</p>
<p>horrified flight, would have fairly passed him unnoticed, had not</p>
<p>George arrested him by a loud shout.</p>
<p>&quot;I beg your pardon, Sir Norman,&quot; he exclaimed, as that gentleman</p>
<p>turned his distracted face; &quot;but, it seems to me, you are running</p>
<p>away.  Here is your horse; and allow me to say, unless we hurry</p>
<p>we will scarcely reach the count by sunrise.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman leaned against his horse, and shaded his eyes with his</p>
<p>hand, shuddering like one in an ague.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did that woman leap into the plague-pit?&quot; inquired George,</p>
<p>looking at him curiously.  &quot;Was it not the sorceress, La Masque?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes.  Do not ask me any questions now,&quot; replied Sir Norman,</p>
<p>in a smothered voice, and with an impatient wave of his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever you please, sir,&quot; said George, with the flippancy of</p>
<p>his class; &quot;but still I must repeat, if you do not mount</p>
<p>instantly, we will be late; and my master, the count, is not one</p>
<p>who brooks delay.&quot;</p>
<p>The young knight vaulted into the saddle without a word, and</p>
<p>started off at a break-neck pace into the city.  George, almost</p>
<p>unable to keep up with him, followed instead of leading, rather</p>
<p>skeptical in his own mind whether he were not riding after a</p>
<p>moon-struck lunatic.  Once or twice he shouted out a sharp-toned</p>
<p>inquiry as to whether he knew where he was going, and that they</p>
<p>were taking the wrong way altogether; to all of which Sir Norman</p>
<p>deigned not the slightest reply, but rode more and more</p>
<p>recklessly on.  There were but few people abroad at that hour;</p>
<p>indeed, for that matter, the streets of London, in the dismal</p>
<p>summer of 1665, were, comparatively speaking, always deserted;</p>
<p>and the few now wending their way homeward were tired physicians</p>
<p>and plague-nurses from the hospitals, and several hardy country</p>
<p>folks, with more love of lucre than fear of death bending their</p>
<p>steps with produce to the market-place.  These people, sleepy and</p>
<p>pallid in the gray haze of daylight, stared in astonishment after</p>
<p>the two furious riders; and windows were thrown open, and heads</p>
<p>thrust out to see what the unusual thunder of horses&#x27; hoofs at</p>
<p>that early hour meant.  George followed dauntlessly on,</p>
<p>determined to do it or die in the attempt; and if he had ever</p>
<p>heard of the Flying Dutchman, would undoubtedly have come to the</p>
<p>conclusion that he was just then following his track on dry land.</p>
<p>But, unlike the hapless Vanderdecken, Sir Norman came to a halt</p>
<p>at last, and that so suddenly that his horse stood on his beam</p>
<p>ends, and flourished his two fore limbs in the atmosphere.  It</p>
<p>was before La Masque&#x27;s door; and Sir Norman was out of the saddle</p>
<p>in a flash, and knocking like a postman with the handle of his</p>
<p>whip on the door.  The thundering reveille rang through the</p>
<p>house, making it shake to its centre, and hurriedly brought to</p>
<p>the door, the anatomy who acted as guardian-angel of the</p>
<p>establishment.</p>
<p>&quot;La Masque is not at home, and I cannot admit you,&quot; was his sharp</p>
<p>salute.</p>
<p>&quot;Then I shall just take the trouble of admitting myself,&quot; said</p>
<p>Sir Norman, shortly.</p>
<p>And without further ceremony, he pushed aside the skeleton and</p>
<p>entered.  But that outraged servitor sprang in his path,</p>
<p>indignant and amazed.</p>
<p>&quot;No, sir; I cannot permit it.  I do not know you; and it is</p>
<p>against all orders to admit strangers in La Masque&#x27;s absence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bah! you old simpleton!&quot; remarked Sir Norman, losing his</p>
<p>customary respect for old age in his impatience, &quot;I have La</p>
<p>Masque&#x27;s order for what I am about to do.  Get along with you</p>
<p>directly, will you? Show me to her private room, and no</p>
<p>nonsense!&quot;</p>
<p>He tapped his sword-hilt significantly as he spoke, and that</p>
<p>argument proved irresistible.  Grumbling, in low tones, the</p>
<p>anatomy stalked up-stairs; and the other followed, with very</p>
<p>different feelings from those with which he had mounted that</p>
<p>staircase last.  His guide paused in the hall above, with his</p>
<p>hand on the latch of a door.</p>
<p>&quot;This is her private room, is it!&quot; demanded Sir Norman.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just stand aside, then, and let me pass.&quot;</p>
<p>The room he entered was small, simply furnished, and seemed to</p>
<p>answer as bed-chamber and study, all in one.  There was a</p>
<p>writing-table under a window, covered with books, and he glanced</p>
<p>at them with some curiosity.  They were classics, Greek and</p>
<p>Latin, and other little known tongues - perhaps Sanscrit and</p>
<p>Chaldaic, French belles lettres, novels, and poetry, and a few</p>
<p>rare old English books.  There were no papers, however, and those</p>
<p>were what he was in search of; so spying a drawer in the table,</p>
<p>he pulled it hastily open.  The eight that met his eyes fairly</p>
<p>dazzled him.  It was full of jewels of incomparable beauty and</p>
<p>value, strewn as carelessly about as if they were valueless.  The</p>
<p>blaze of gems at the midnight court seemed to him as nothing</p>
<p>compared with the Golconda, the Valley of Diamonds shooting forth</p>
<p>sparks of rainbow-fire before him now.  Around one magnificent</p>
<p>diamond necklace was entwined a scrap of paper, on which was</p>
<p>written:</p>
<p>&quot;The family jewels of the Montmorencis.  To be given to my</p>
<p>sisters when I am dead.&quot;</p>
<p>That settled their destiny.  All this blaze of diamonds, rubies,</p>
<p>and opals were Leoline&#x27;s; and with the energetic rapidity</p>
<p>characteristic of our young friend that morning, he swept them</p>
<p>out on the table, and resumed his search for papers.  No document</p>
<p>was there to reward his search, but the brief one twined round</p>
<p>the necklace; and he was about giving up in despair, when a small</p>
<p>brass slide in one corner caught his eye.  Instantly he was at</p>
<p>it, trying it every way, shoving it out and in, and up and down,</p>
<p>until at last it yielded to his touch, disclosing an inner</p>
<p>drawer, full of papers and parchments.  One glance showed them to</p>
<p>be what he was in search of - proofs of Leoline and Hubert&#x27;s</p>
<p>identity, with the will of the marquis, their father, and</p>
<p>numerous other documents relative to his wealth and estates.</p>
<p>These precious manuscripts he rolled together in a bundle, and</p>
<p>placed carefully in his doublet, and then seizing a</p>
<p>beautifully-wrought brass casket, that stood beneath the table,</p>
<p>he swept the jewels in, secured it, and strapped it to his belt.</p>
<p>This brisk and important little affair being over, he arose to</p>
<p>go, and in turning, saw the skeleton porter standing in the</p>
<p>door-way, looking on in speechless dismay.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all right my ancient friend!&quot; observed Sir Norman, gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;These papers must go before the king, and these jewels to their</p>
<p>proper owner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Their proper owner!&quot; repeated the old man, shrilly; &quot;that is La</p>
<p>Masque.  Thief-robber-housebreaker - stop!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My good old friend, you will do yourself a mischief if you bawl</p>
<p>like that.  Undoubtedly these things were La Masque&#x27;s, but they</p>
<p>are so no longer, since La Masque herself is among the things</p>
<p>that were!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You shall not go!&quot; yelled the old man, trembling with rage and</p>
<p>anger. &quot;Help! help! help!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You noisy old idiot!&quot; cried Sir Norman, losing all patience, &quot;I</p>
<p>will throw you out of the window if you keep up such a clamor as</p>
<p>this.  I tell you La Masque is dead!&quot;</p>
<p>At this ominous announcement, the ghastly porter fell back, and</p>
<p>became, if possible, a shade more ghastly than was his wont.</p>
<p>&quot;Dead and buried!&quot; repeated Sir Norman, with gloomy</p>
<p>sternness,&quot;and there will be somebody else coming to take</p>
<p>possession shortly.  How many more servants are there here beside</p>
<p>yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only one, sir - my wife Joanna.  In mercy&#x27;s name, sir, do not</p>
<p>turn us out in the streets at this dreadful time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not I!  You and your wife Joanna may stagnate here till you</p>
<p>blue-mold, for me.  But keep the door fast, my good old friend,</p>
<p>and admit no strangers, but those who can tell you La Masque is</p>
<p>dead!&quot;</p>
<p>With which parting piece of advice Sir Norman left the house, and</p>
<p>joined George, who sat like an effigy before the door, in a state</p>
<p>of great mental wrath, and who accosted him rather suddenly the</p>
<p>moment be made his appearance.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you what, Sir Norman Kingsley, if you have many more</p>
<p>morning calls to make, I shall beg leave to take my departure.</p>
<p>As it is, I know we are behind time, and his ma - the count, I</p>
<p>mean, is not one who it accustomed or inclined to be kept</p>
<p>waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am quite at your service now,&quot; said Sir Norman, springing on</p>
<p>horseback; &quot;so away with you, quick as you like.&quot;</p>
<p>George wanted no second order.  Before the words were well out of</p>
<p>his companion&#x27;s mouth, he was dashing away like a bolt from a</p>
<p>bow, as furiously as if on a steeple-chase, with Sir Norman close</p>
<p>at his heels; and they rode, flushed and breathless, with their</p>
<p>steeds all a foaming, into the court-yard of the royal palace at</p>
<p>Whitehall, just as the early rising sun was showing his florid</p>
<p>and burning visage above the horizon.</p>

<p>The court-yard, unlike the city streets, swarmed with busy life.</p>
<p>Pages, and attendants, and soldiers, moving hither and thither,</p>
<p>or lounging about, preparing for the morning&#x27;s journey to Oxford.</p>
<p>Among the rest Sir Norman observed Hubert, lying very much at his</p>
<p>ease wrapped in his cloak, on the ground, and chatting languidly</p>
<p>with a pert and pretty attendant of the fair Mistress Stuart.  He</p>
<p>cut short his flirtation, however, abruptly enough, and sprang to</p>
<p>his feet as he saw Sir Norman, while George immediately darted</p>
<p>off and disappeared from the palace.</p>
<p>&quot;Am I late Hubert?&quot; said his hurried questioner, as he drew the</p>
<p>lad&#x27;s arm within his own, and led him off out of hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;I think not.  The count,&quot; said Hubert, with laughing emphasis,</p>
<p>&quot;has not been visible since he entered yonder doorway, and there</p>
<p>has been no message that I have heard of.  Doubtless, now that</p>
<p>George has arrived, the message will soon be here, for the royal</p>
<p>procession starts within half an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure there is no trick, Hubert?  Even now he may be with</p>
<p>Leoline!&quot;</p>
<p>Hubert shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;He maybe; we must take our chance for that; but we have his</p>
<p>royal word to the contrary.  Not that I have much faith in that!&quot;</p>
<p>said Hubert.</p>
<p>&quot;If he were king of the world instead of only England,&quot; cried Sir</p>
<p>Norman, with flashing eyes, &quot;he shall not have Leoline while I</p>
<p>wear a sword to defend her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Regicide!&quot; exclaimed Hubert, holding up both hands in affected</p>
<p>horror.  &quot;Do my ears deceive me   Is this the loyal and</p>
<p>chivalrous Sir Norman Kingsley, ready to die for king and country</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Stuff and nonsense!&quot; interrupted Sir Norman, impatiently.  &quot;I</p>
<p>tell you any one, be he whom he may, that attempts to take</p>
<p>Leoline from me, must reach her over my dead body!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bravo!  You ought to be a Frenchman, Sir Norman!  And what if</p>
<p>the lady herself, finding her dazzling suitor drop his barnyard</p>
<p>feathers, and soar over her head in his own eagle plumes, may not</p>
<p>give you your dismissal, and usurp the place of pretty Madame</p>
<p>Stuart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You cold-blooded young villain! if you insinuate such a thing</p>
<p>again, I&#x27;ll throttle you!  Leoline loves me, and me alone!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doubtless she thinks so; but she has yet to learn she has a king</p>
<p>for a suitor!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bah!  You are nothing but a heartless cynic,&quot; said Sir Norman,</p>
<p>yet with an anxious and irritated flush on his face, too: &quot;What</p>
<p>do you know of love?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More than you think, as pretty Mariette yonder could depose, if</p>
<p>put upon oath.  But seriously, Sir Norman, I am afraid your case</p>
<p>is of the most desperate; royal rivals are dangerous things!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet Charles has kind impulses, and has been known to do generous</p>
<p>acts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has he?  You expect him, beyond doubt, to do precisely as he</p>
<p>said; and if Leoline, different from all the rest of her sex,</p>
<p>prefers the knight to the king, he will yield her unresistingly</p>
<p>to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have nothing but his word for it!&quot; said Sir Norman, in a</p>
<p>distracted tone, &quot;and, at present, can do nothing but bide my</p>
<p>time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have been thinking of that, too!  I promised, you know, when I</p>
<p>left her, last night, that we would return before day-dawn, and</p>
<p>rescue her.  The unhappy little beauty will doubtless think I</p>
<p>have fallen into the tiger&#x27;s jaws myself, and has half wept her</p>
<p>bright eyes out by this time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My poor Leoline!  And O Hubert, if you only knew what she is to</p>
<p>you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do know!  She told me she was my sister!&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman looked at him in amazement.</p>
<p>&quot;She told you, and you take it like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly, I take it like this.  How would you have me take it?</p>
<p>It is nothing to go into hysterics about, after all!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of all the cold-blooded young reptiles I ever saw,&quot; exclaimed</p>
<p>Sir Norman, with infinite disgust, &quot;you are the worst!  If you</p>
<p>were told you were to receive the crown of France to-morrow, you</p>
<p>would probably open your eyes a trifle, and take it as you would</p>
<p>a new cap!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I would.  I haven&#x27;t lived in courts half my life to</p>
<p>get up a scene for a small matter!  Besides, I had an idea from</p>
<p>the first moment I saw Leoline that she must be my sister, or</p>
<p>something of that sort.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And so you felt no emotion whatever on hearing it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know as I properly understand what you mean by emotion,&quot;</p>
<p>said Herbert, reflectively.  &quot;But ye-e-s, I did feel somewhat</p>
<p>pleased - she is so like me, and so uncommonly handsome!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Humph! there&#x27;s a reason!  Did she tell you how she discovered it</p>
<p>herself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let me see  -no - I think not - she simply mentioned the fact.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She did not tell you either, I suppose, that you had more</p>
<p>sisters than herself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More than herself!  No.  That would be a little too much of a</p>
<p>good thing!  One sister is quite enough for any reasonable</p>
<p>mortal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But there were two more, my good young friend!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible?&quot; said Hubert, in a tone that betrayed not the</p>
<p>slightest symptom of emotion.  &quot;Who are they?&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman paused one instant, combating a strong temptation to</p>
<p>seize the phlegmatic page by the collar, and give him such</p>
<p>another shaking as he would not get over for a week to come; but</p>
<p>suddenly recollecting he was Leoline&#x27;s brother, and by the same</p>
<p>token a marquis or thereabouts, he merely paused to cast a</p>
<p>withering look upon him, and walked on.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Hubert, &quot;I am waiting to be told.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You may wait, then!&quot; said Sir Norman, with a smothered growl;</p>
<p>&quot;and I give you joy when I tell you.  Such extra</p>
<p>communicativeness to one so stolid could do no good!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I am not stolid!  I am in a perfect agony of anxiety,&quot; said</p>
<p>Hubert.</p>
<p>&quot;You young jackanapes!&quot; said Sir Norman, half-laughing, half-</p>
<p>incensed.  &quot;It were a wise deed and a godly one to take you by</p>
<p>the hind-leg and nape of the neck, and pitch you over yonder</p>
<p>wall; but for your mister&#x27;s sake I will desist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which of them?&quot; inquired Hubert, with provoking gravity.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be more to the point if you asked me who the others</p>
<p>were, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I have, and you merely abused me for it.  But I think I know</p>
<p>one of them without being told.  It is that other fac-simile of</p>
<p>Leoline and myself who died in the robber&#x27;s ruin!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exactly.  You and she, and Leoline, were triplets!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who is the other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her name is La Masque.  Have you ever heard it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;La Masque!  Nonsense!&quot; exclaimed Hubert, with some energy in his</p>
<p>voice at last.   &quot;You but jest, Sir Norman Kingsley!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No such thing!  It is a positive fact!  She told me the whole</p>
<p>story herself!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what is the whole story; and why did she not tell it to me</p>
<p>instead of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She told it to Leoline, thinking, probably, she had the most</p>
<p>sense; and she told it to me, as Leoline&#x27;s future husband.  It is</p>
<p>somewhat long to relate, but it will help to beguile the time</p>
<p>while we are waiting for the royal summons.&quot;</p>
<p>And hereupon Sir Norman, without farther preface, launched into a</p>
<p>rapid resume of La Masque&#x27;s story, feeling the cold chill with</p>
<p>which he had witnessed it creep over him as he narrated her</p>
<p>fearful end.</p>
<p>&quot;It struck me,&quot; concluded Sir Norman, &quot;that it would be better to</p>
<p>procure any papers she might possess at once, lest, by accident,</p>
<p>they should fall into other hands; so I rode there directly, and,</p>
<p>in spite of the cantankerous old porter, searched diligently,</p>
<p>until I found them.  Here they are,&quot; said Sir Norman, drawing</p>
<p>forth the roll.</p>
<p>&quot;And what do you intend doing with them?&quot; inquired Hubert,</p>
<p>glancing at the papers with an unmoved countenance.</p>
<p>&quot;Show them to the king, and, though his mediation with Louis,</p>
<p>obtain for you the restoration of your rights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And do you think his majesty will give himself so much trouble</p>
<p>for the Earl of Rochester&#x27;s page?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think he will take the trouble to see justice done, or at</p>
<p>least he ought to.  If he declines, we will take the matter in</p>
<p>our own hands, my Hubert; and you and I will seek Louis</p>
<p>ourselves.  Please God, the Earl of Rochester&#x27;s page will yet</p>
<p>wear the coronet of the De Montmorencis!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And the sister of a marquis will be no unworthy mate even for a</p>
<p>Kingsley,&quot; said Hubert.  &quot;Has La Masque left nothing for her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you see this casket?&quot; tapping the one of cared brass dangling</p>
<p>from his belt; &quot;well, it is full of jewels worth a king&#x27;s ransom.</p>
<p>I found them in a drawer of La Masque&#x27;s house, with directions</p>
<p>that they were to be given to her sisters at her death.  Miranda</p>
<p>being dead, I presume they are all Leoline&#x27;s now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a queer business altogether!&quot; said Hubert, musingly;</p>
<p>&quot;and I am greatly mistaken if King Louie will not regard it as a</p>
<p>very pretty little work of fiction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I have proofs, lad!  The authenticity of these papers cannot</p>
<p>be doubted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With all my heart.  I have no objections to be made a marquis</p>
<p>of, and go back to la belle France, out of this land of plague</p>
<p>and fog.  Won&#x27;t some of my friends here be astonished when they</p>
<p>hear it, particularly the Earl of Rochester, when he finds out</p>
<p>that he has had a marquis for a page?  Ah, here comes George, and</p>
<p>bearing a summons from Count L&#x27;Estrange at last.&quot;</p>
<p>George approached, and intimated that Sir Norman was to follow</p>
<p>him to the presence of his master.</p>
<p>&quot;Au revoir, then,&quot; said Hubert.  &quot;You will find me here when you</p>
<p>come back.&quot;</p>
<p>Sir Norman, with a slight tremor of the nerves at what was to</p>
<p>come, followed the king&#x27;s page through halls and anterooms, full</p>
<p>of loiterers, courtiers, and their attendants.  Once a hand was</p>
<p>laid on his shoulder, a laughing voice met his ear, and the Earl</p>
<p>of Rochester stood beside him!</p>
<p>&quot;Good-morning, Sir Norman; you are abroad betimes.  How have you</p>
<p>left your friend, the Count L&#x27;Estrange?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your lordship has probably seen him since I have, and should be</p>
<p>able to answer that question best.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how does his suit progress with the pretty Leoline?&quot; went on</p>
<p>the gay earl.  &quot;In faith, Kingsley, I never saw such a charming</p>
<p>little beauty; and I shall do combat with you yet - with both the</p>
<p>count and yourself, and outwit the pair of you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Permit me to differ from your lordship.  Leoline would not touch</p>
<p>you with a pair of tongs!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! she has better taste than you give her credit for; but if I</p>
<p>should fail, I know what to do to console myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May I ask what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! there is Hubert, as like her an two peas in a pod.  I shall</p>
<p>dress him up in lace and silks, and gewgaws, and have a Leoline</p>
<p>of my own already made its order.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Permit me to doubt that, too!  Hubert is as much lost to you as</p>
<p>Leoline!&quot;</p>
<p>Leaving the volatile earl to put what construction pleased him</p>
<p>best on this last sententious remark, he resumed his march after</p>
<p>George, and was ushered, at last, into an ante-room near the</p>
<p>audience-chamber.  Count L&#x27;Estrange, still attired as Count</p>
<p>L&#x27;Estrange, stood near a window overlooking the court-yard, and</p>
<p>as the page salaamed and withdrew, he turned round, and greeted</p>
<p>Sir Norman with his suavest air.</p>
<p>&quot;The appointed hour is passed, Sir Norman Kingsley, but that is</p>
<p>partly your own fault.  Your guide hither tells me that you</p>
<p>stopped for some time at the house of a fortune-teller, known as</p>
<p>La Masque.  Why was this!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was forced to stop on most important business,&quot; answered the</p>
<p>knight, still resolved to treat him as the count, until it should</p>
<p>please him to doff his incognito, &quot;of which you shall hear anon.</p>
<p>Just now, our business is with Leoline.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;True!  And as in a short time I start with yonder cavalcade,</p>
<p>there is but little time to lose.  Apropos, Kingsley, who is that</p>
<p>mysterious woman, La Masque?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She is, or was (for she is dead sow) a French lady, of noble</p>
<p>birth, and the sister of Leoline!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her sister!  And have you discovered Leoline&#x27;s history?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And her name!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And her name.  She is Leoline De Montmorenci!  And with the</p>
<p>proudest blood of France in her veins, living obscure and unknown</p>
<ul>
<li>a stranger in a strange land since childhood; but, with God&#x27;s</li>
</ul>
<p>grace and your help, I hope to see her restored to all she has</p>
<p>lost, before long.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;you know me, then?&quot; said his companion, half-smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, your majesty,&quot; answered Sir Norman, bowing low before the</p>
<p>king.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>
<p>FINIS</p>
<p>As the last glimpse of moonlight and of Hubert&#x27;s bright face</p>
<p>vanished, Leoline took to pacing up and down the room in a most</p>
<p>conflicting and excited state of mind.  So many things had</p>
<p>happened during the past night; so rapid and unprecedented had</p>
<p>been the course of events; so changed had her whole life become</p>
<p>within the last twelve hours, that when she came to think it all</p>
<p>over, it fairly made her giddy.  Dressing for her bridal; the</p>
<p>terrible announcement of Prudence; the death-like swoon; the</p>
<p>awakening at the plague-pit; the maniac flight through the</p>
<p>streets; the cold plunge in the river; her rescue; her interview</p>
<p>with Sir Norman, and her promise; the visit of La Masque; the</p>
<p>appearance of the count; her abduction; her journey here; the</p>
<p>coming of Hubert, and their suddenly-discovered relationship.  It</p>
<p>was enough to stun any one; and the end was not yet.  Would</p>
<p>Hubert effect his escape?  Would they be able to free her?  What</p>
<p>place was this, and who was Count L&#x27;Estrange?  It was a great</p>
<p>deal easier to propound this catechism to herself than to find</p>
<p>answers to her own questions; and so she walked up and down,</p>
<p>worrying her pretty little head with all sorts of anxieties,</p>
<p>until it was a perfect miracle that softening of the brain did</p>
<p>not ensue.</p>
<p>Her feet gave out sooner than her brain, though; and she got so</p>
<p>tired before long, that she dropped into a seat, with a</p>
<p>long-drawn, anxious sigh; and, worn out with fatigue and</p>
<p>watching, she, at last, fell asleep.</p>
<p>And sleeping, she dreamed.  It seemed to her that the count and</p>
<p>Sir Norman were before her, in her chamber in the old house on</p>
<p>London Bridge, tossing her heart between them like a sort of</p>
<p>shuttlecock.  By-and-by, with two things like two drumsticks,</p>
<p>they began hammering away at the poor, little, fluttering heart,</p>
<p>as if it were an anvil and they were a pair of blacksmiths, while</p>
<p>the loud knocks upon it resounded through the room.  For a time,</p>
<p>she was so bewildered that she could not comprehend what it</p>
<p>meant; but, at last, she became conscious that some one was</p>
<p>rapping at the door.  Pressing one hand over her startled heart,</p>
<p>she called &quot;Come in!&quot; and the door opened and George entered.</p>
<p>&quot;Count L&#x27;Estrange commands me to inform you, fair lady, that he</p>
<p>will do himself the pleasure of visiting you immediately, with</p>
<p>Sir Norman Kingsley, if you are prepared to receive them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With Sir Norman Kingsley!&quot; repeated Leoline, faintly.  &quot;I-I am</p>
<p>afraid I do not quite understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you will not be much longer in that deplorable state,&quot; said</p>
<p>George, backing out, &quot;for here they are.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon this intrusion, fairest Leoline,&quot; began the count, &quot;but</p>
<p>Sir Norman and I are about to start on a journey, and before we</p>
<p>go, there is a little difference of opinion between us that you</p>
<p>are to settle.&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline looked first at one, and then at the other, utterly</p>
<p>bewildered.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;A simple matter enough.  Last evening, if you recollect, you</p>
<p>were my promised bride.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was against my will,&quot; said Leoline, boldly, though her voice</p>
<p>shook, &quot;You and Prudence made me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, Leoline, you wrong me.  I, at least, need no compulsion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know better.  You haunted me continually; you gave me no</p>
<p>peace at all; and I world just have married you to get rid of</p>
<p>you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you never loved me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A frank confession!  Did you, then, love any one else?&quot;</p>
<p>The dark eyes fell, and the roseate glow again tinged the pearly</p>
<p>face.</p>
<p>&quot;Mute!&quot; said the count, with an almost imperceptible smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Look up, Leoline, and speak.&quot;</p>
<p>But Leoline would do neither.  With all her momentary daring</p>
<p>gone, she stood startled as a wild gazelle.</p>
<p>&quot;Shall I answer for her, Sir Count?&quot; exclaimed Sir Norman, his</p>
<p>own cheek dashed.  &quot;Leoline!  Leoline! you love me!&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline was silent;</p>
<p>&quot;You are to decide between us, Leoline.  Though the count</p>
<p>forcibly brought you here, he has been generous enough to grant</p>
<p>this.  Say, then, which of as you love best.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not love him at all,&quot; aid Leoline, with s little disdain,</p>
<p>&quot;and he knows it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then it is I!&quot; said Sir Norman, him whole lace beaming with</p>
<p>delight.</p>
<p>&quot;It is you!&quot;</p>
<p>Leoline held out both hands to the loved one, and nestled close</p>
<p>to his side, like a child would to its protector.</p>
<p>&quot;Fairly rejected!&quot; said the count, with a pacing shade of</p>
<p>mortification on his brow; &quot;and, my word being pledged, I most</p>
<p>submit.  But, beautiful Leoline, you have yet to learn whom you</p>
<p>have discarded.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinging to her lover&#x27;s arm, the girl grew white with undefined</p>
<p>apprehension.  Leisurely, the count removed false wig, false</p>
<p>eyebrows, false heard; and a face well known to Leoline, from</p>
<p>pictures and description, turned full upon her.</p>
<p>&quot;Sire!&quot; she cried, in terror, calling on her knees with clasped</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Nay; rise, fair Leoline,&quot; said the king, holding out his hand to</p>
<p>assist her.  &quot;It is my place to kneel to one so lovely instead of</p>
<p>having her kneel to me.  Think again.  Will you reject the king</p>
<p>as you did the count?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon, your majesty!&quot;, said Leoline, scarcely daring to look</p>
<p>up; &quot;but I must!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So be it!  You are a perfect miracle of troth and constancy, and</p>
<p>I think I can afford to be generous for once.  In fifteen</p>
<p>minutes, we start for Oxford, and you must accompany us as Lady</p>
<p>Kingsley.  A tiring woman will wait upon you to robe you for your</p>
<p>bridal.  We will leave you now, and let me enjoin expedition.&quot;</p>
<p>And while she still stood too much astonished by the sudden</p>
<p>proposal to answer, both were gone, and in their place stood a</p>
<p>smiling lady&#x27;s maid, with a cloud of gossamer white in her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Are those for me?&quot; inquired Leoline, looking at them, and trying</p>
<p>to comprehend that it was all real.</p>
<p>&quot;They are for you - sent by Mistress Stuart, herself.  Please sit</p>
<p>down, and all will be ready in a trice.&quot;</p>
<p>And in a trice all was ready.  The shining, jetty curls were</p>
<p>smoothed, and fell in a glossy shower, trained with jewels - the</p>
<p>pearls Leoline herself still wore.  The rose satin was discarded</p>
<p>for another of bridal white, perfect of fit, and splendid of</p>
<p>feature.  A great gossamer veil like a cloud of silver mist over</p>
<p>all, from head to foot; and Leoline was shown herself in a</p>
<p>mirror, and in the sudden transformation, could have exclaimed,</p>
<p>with the unfortunate lady in bother Goose, shorn of her tresses</p>
<p>when in balmy slumber:  &quot;As sure as I&#x27;m a little woman, this is</p>
<p>none of it!&quot;  But she it was, nevertheless, who stood listening</p>
<p>like one in a trance, to the enthusiastic praises of her</p>
<p>waiting-maid.</p>
<p>Again there was a tap at the door.  This time the attendant</p>
<p>opened it, and George reappeared.  Even he stood for a moment</p>
<p>looking at the silver-shining vision, and so lost in admiration,</p>
<p>that he almost forgot his message.  But when Leoline turned the</p>
<p>light of her beautiful eyes inquiringly upon him, he managed to</p>
<p>remember it, and announced that he had been sent by the king to</p>
<p>usher her to the royal presence.</p>
<p>With a feet-throbbing heart, flushed cheeks, and brilliant eyes,</p>
<p>the dazzling bride followed him, unconscious that she had never</p>
<p>looked so incomparably before in her life.  It was but a few</p>
<p>hours since she had dressed for another bridal; and what</p>
<p>wonderful things had occurred since then - her whole destiny had</p>
<p>changed in a night.  Not quite sure yet but that she was still</p>
<p>dreaming, she followed on - saw George throw open the great doors</p>
<p>of the audience-chamber, and found herself suddenly in what</p>
<p>seemed to her a vast concourse of people.  At the upper end of</p>
<p>the apartment was s brilliant group of ladies, with the king&#x27;s</p>
<p>beautiful favorite in their midst, gossiping with knots of</p>
<p>gentlemen.  The king himself stood in the recess of a window,</p>
<p>with his brother, the Duke of York, the Earl of Rochester, and</p>
<p>Sir Norman Kingsley, and was laughing and relating animatedly to</p>
<p>the two peers the whole story.  Leoline noticed this, and</p>
<p>noticed, too, that all wore traveling dresses - most of the</p>
<p>ladies, indeed, being attired in riding-habits.</p>
<p>The king himself advanced to her rescue, and drawing her arm</p>
<p>within his, he led her up and presented her to the fair Mistress</p>
<p>Stuart, who received her with smiling graciousness though</p>
<p>Leoline, all unused to court ways, and aware of the lovely lady&#x27;s</p>
<p>questionable position, returned it almost with cold hauteur.</p>
<p>Charles being in an unusually gracious mood, only smiled as he</p>
<p>noticed it, and introduced her next to his brother of York, and</p>
<p>her former short acquaintance, Rochester.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s no need, I presume, to make you acquainted with this</p>
<p>other gentleman, sand Charles, with s laughing glance at Sir</p>
<p>Norman.  &quot;Kingsley, stand forward and receive your bride.  My</p>
<p>Lord of Canterbury, we await your good offices.&quot;</p>
<p>The bland bishop, in surplice and stole, and book in hand,</p>
<p>stepped from a distant group, and advanced.  Sir Norman, with a</p>
<p>flush on his cheek, and an exultant light in his eyes, took the</p>
<p>hand of his beautiful bride who stood lovely, and blushing, and</p>
<p>downcast, the envy and admiration of all.  And</p>

<p>Who indeed?  Like many other pleasant things is this world, it</p>
<p>requires to be felt to be appreciated; and, for that reason, it</p>
<p>is a subject on which the unworthy chronicler is altogether</p>
<p>incompetent to speak.  The first words of the ceremony dropped</p>
<p>from the prelate&#x27;s urbane lips, and Sir Norman&#x27;s heart danced a</p>
<p>tarantella within him.  &quot;Wilt thou?&quot; inquired the bishop,</p>
<p>blandly, and slipped a plain gold ring on one pretty finger of</p>
<p>Leoline&#x27;s hand and all heard the old, old formula:  &quot;What God</p>
<p>hath joined together, let no man put asunder!&quot;  And the whole</p>
<p>mystic rite was over.</p>
<p>Leoline gave one earnest glance at the ring on her finger.  Long</p>
<p>ago, slaves wore rings as the sign of their bondage - is it for</p>
<p>the same reason married women wear them now?  While she yet</p>
<p>looked half-doubtfully at it, she was surrounded, congratulated,</p>
<p>and stunned with a sadden clamor of voices; and then, through it</p>
<p>all, she heard the well-remembered voice of Count L&#x27;Estrange,</p>
<p>saying:</p>
<p>&quot;My lords and ladies, time is on the wing, and the sun is already</p>
<p>half an hour high!  Off with you all to the courtyard, and mount,</p>
<p>while Lady Kingsley changes her wedding-gear for robes more</p>
<p>befitting travel, and joins us there.&quot;</p>
<p>With a low obeisance to the king, the lovely bride hastened away</p>
<p>after one of the favorite&#x27;s attendants, to do as he directed, and</p>
<p>don a riding-suit.  In ten minutes after, when the royal</p>
<p>cavalcade started, she turned from the pest-stricken city, too</p>

<p>Sitting one winter night by a glorious winter fire, while the</p>
<p>snow and hail lashed the windows, and the wind without roared</p>
<p>like Bottom, the weaver, a pleasant voice whispered the foregoing</p>
<p>tale.  Here, as it paused abruptly, and seemed to have done with</p>
<p>the whole thing, I naturally began to ask questions.  What</p>
<p>happened the dwarf and his companions?  What became of Hubert?</p>
<p>Did Sir Norman and Lady Kingsley go to Devonshire, and did either</p>
<p>of them die of the plague?  I felt, myself, when I said it, that</p>
<p>the last suggestion was beneath contempt, and so a withering look</p>
<p>from the face opposite proved; but the voice was obliging enough</p>
<p>to answer the rest of my queries.  The dwarf and his cronies</p>
<p>being put into his majesty&#x27;s jail of Newgate, where the plague</p>
<p>was raging fearfully, they all died in a week, and so managed to</p>
<p>cheat the executioner.  Hubert went to France, and laid his</p>
<p>claims before the royal Louis, who, not being able to do</p>
<p>otherwise, was graciously pleased to acknowledge them; and Hubert</p>
<p>became the Marquis de Montmorenci, and in the fullness of time</p>
<p>took unto himself a wife, even of the daughters of the land, and</p>
<p>lived happy for ever after.</p>
<p>And Sir Norman and Lady Kingsley did go to the old manor in</p>
<p>Devonshire, where - with tradition and my informant - there is to</p>
<p>be seen to this day, an old family-picture, painted some twelve</p>
<p>years after, representing the knight and his lady sitting</p>
<p>serenely in their &quot;ain ingle nook&quot; with their family around them.</p>
<p>Sir Norman,- a little portlier, a little graver, in the serious</p>
<p>dignity of pater familias; and Leoline, with the dark, beautiful</p>
<p>eyes, the falling, shining hair, the sweet smiling lips, and</p>
<p>lovely, placid face of old.  Between them, on three hassocks, sit</p>
<p>three little boys; while the fourth, and youngest, a miniature</p>
<p>little Sir Norman, leans against his mother&#x27;s shoulder, and looks</p>
<p>thoughtfully in her sweet, calm face.  Of the fate of those four,</p>
<p>the same ancient lore affirms: &quot;That the eldest afterward bore</p>
<p>the title of Earl of Kingsley; that the second became a lord high</p>
<p>admiral, or chancellor, or something equally highfalutin; and</p>
<p>that the third became an archbishop.  But the highest honor of</p>
<p>all was reserved for the fourth, and youngest,&quot; continued the</p>
<p>narrating voice, &quot;who, after many days, sailed for America, and,</p>
<p>in the course of time, became President of the United States .&quot;</p>
<p>Determined to be fully satisfied on this point, at least, the</p>
<p>author invested all her spare change in a catalogue of all the</p>
<p>said Presidents, from George Washington to Chester A. Arthur,</p>
<p>and, after a diligent and absorbing perusal of that piece of</p>
<p>literature, could find no such name as Kingsley whatever; and has</p>
<p>been forced to come to the conclusion that he most have applied</p>
<p>to Congress to change his name on arriving in the New World, or</p>
<p>else that her informant was laboring reader a falsehood when she</p>
<p>told her so.  As for the rest,</p>
