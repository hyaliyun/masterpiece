<p>TIMAEUS</p>
<p>PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE: SOCRATES; CRITIAS; TIMAEUS; HERMOCRATES</p>
<p>Socrates. One, two, three; but where, my dear Timaeus, is the fourth</p>
<p>of those who were yesterday my guests and are to be my entertainers</p>
<p>to-day?</p>
<p>Timaeus. He has been taken ill, Socrates; for he would not willingly</p>
<p>have been absent from this gathering.</p>
<p>Soc. Then, if he is not coming, you and the two others must supply</p>
<p>his place.</p>
<p>Tim. Certainly, and we will do all that we can; having been</p>
<p>handsomely entertained by you yesterday, those of us who remain should</p>
<p>be only too glad to return your hospitality.</p>
<p>Soc. Do you remember what were the points of which I required you to</p>
<p>speak?</p>
<p>Tim. We remember some of them, and you will be here to remind us</p>
<p>of anything which we have forgotten: or rather, if we are not</p>
<p>troubling you, will you briefly recapitulate the whole, and then the</p>
<p>particulars will be more firmly fixed in our memories?</p>
<p>Soc. To be sure I will: the chief theme of my yesterday&#x27;s</p>
<p>discourse was the State-how constituted and of what citizens</p>
<p>composed it would seem likely to be most perfect.</p>
<p>Tim. Yes, Socrates; and what you said of it was very much to our</p>
<p>mind.</p>
<p>Soc. Did we not begin by separating the husbandmen and the</p>
<p>artisans from the class of defenders of the State?</p>
<p>Tim. Yes.</p>
<p>Soc. And when we had given to each one that single employment and</p>
<p>particular art which was suited to his nature, we spoke of those who</p>
<p>were intended to be our warriors, and said that they were to be</p>
<p>guardians of the city against attacks from within as well as from</p>
<p>without, and to have no other employment; they were to be merciful</p>
<p>in judging their subjects, of whom they were by nature friends, but</p>
<p>fierce to their enemies, when they came across them in battle.</p>
<p>Tim. Exactly.</p>
<p>Soc. We said, if I am not mistaken, that the guardians should be</p>
<p>gifted with a temperament in a high degree both passionate and</p>
<p>philosophical; and that then they would be as they ought to be, gentle</p>
<p>to their friends and fierce with their enemies.</p>
<p>Tim. Certainly.</p>
<p>Soc. And what did we say of their education? Were they not to be</p>
<p>trained in gymnastic, and music, and all other sorts of knowledge</p>
<p>which were proper for them?</p>
<p>Tim. Very true.</p>
<p>Soc. And being thus trained they were not to consider gold or silver</p>
<p>or anything else to be their own private property; they were to be</p>
<p>like hired troops, receiving pay for keeping guard from those who were</p>
<p>protected by them-the pay was to be no more than would suffice for men</p>
<p>of simple life; and they were to spend in common, and to live together</p>
<p>in the continual practice of virtue, which was to be their sole</p>
<p>pursuit.</p>
<p>Tim. That was also said.</p>
<p>Soc. Neither did we forget the women; of whom we declared, that</p>
<p>their natures should be assimilated and brought into harmony with</p>
<p>those of the men, and that common pursuits should be assigned to</p>
<p>them both in time of war and in their ordinary life.</p>
<p>Tim. That, again, was as you say.</p>
<p>Soc. And what about the procreation of children? Or rather not the</p>
<p>proposal too singular to be forgotten? for all wives and children were</p>
<p>to be in common, to the intent that no one should ever know his own</p>
<p>child, but they were to imagine that they were all one family; those</p>
<p>who were within a suitable limit of age were to be brothers and</p>
<p>sisters, those who were of an elder generation parents and</p>
<p>grandparents, and those of a younger children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Tim. Yes, and the proposal is easy to remember, as you say.</p>
<p>Soc. And do you also remember how, with a view of securing as far as</p>
<p>we could the best breed, we said that the chief magistrates, male</p>
<p>and female, should contrive secretly, by the use of certain lots, so</p>
<p>to arrange the nuptial meeting, that the bad of either sex and the</p>
<p>good of either sex might pair with their like; and there was to be</p>
<p>no quarrelling on this account, for they would imagine that the</p>
<p>union was a mere accident, and was to be attributed to the lot?</p>
<p>Tim. I remember.</p>
<p>Soc. And you remember how we said that the children of the good</p>
<p>parents were to be educated, and the children of the bad secretly</p>
<p>dispersed among the inferior citizens; and while they were all growing</p>
<p>up the rulers were to be on the look-out, and to bring up from below</p>
<p>in their turn those who were worthy, and those among themselves who</p>
<p>were unworthy were to take the places of those who came up?</p>
<p>Tim. True.</p>
<p>Soc. Then have I now given you all the heads of our yesterday&#x27;s</p>
<p>discussion? Or is there anything more, my dear Timaeus, which has been</p>
<p>omitted?</p>
<p>Tim. Nothing, Socrates; it was just as you have said.</p>
<p>Soc. I should like, before proceeding further, to tell you how I</p>
<p>feel about the State which we have described. I might compare myself</p>
<p>to a person who, on beholding beautiful animals either created by</p>
<p>the painter&#x27;s art, or, better still, alive but at rest, is seized with</p>
<p>a desire of seeing them in motion or engaged in some struggle or</p>
<p>conflict to which their forms appear suited; this is my feeling</p>
<p>about the State which we have been describing. There are conflicts</p>
<p>which all cities undergo, and I should like to hear some one tell of</p>
<p>our own city carrying on a struggle against her neighbours, and how</p>
<p>she went out to war in a becoming manner, and when at war showed by</p>
<p>the greatness of her actions and the magnanimity of her words in</p>
<p>dealing with other cities a result worthy of her training and</p>
<p>education. Now I, Critias and Hermocrates, am conscious that I</p>
<p>myself should never be able to celebrate the city and her citizens</p>
<p>in a befitting manner, and I am not surprised at my own incapacity; to</p>
<p>me the wonder is rather that the poets present as well as past are</p>
<p>no better-not that I mean to depreciate them; but every one can see</p>
<p>that they are a tribe of imitators, and will imitate best and most</p>
<p>easily the life in which they have been brought up; while that which</p>
<p>is beyond the range of a man&#x27;s education he finds hard to carry out in</p>
<p>action, and still harder adequately to represent in language. I am</p>
<p>aware that the Sophists have plenty of brave words and fair</p>
<p>conceits, but I am afraid that being only wanderers from one city to</p>
<p>another, and having never had habitations of their own, they may</p>
<p>fail in their conception of philosophers and statesmen, and may not</p>
<p>know what they do and say in time of war, when they are fighting or</p>
<p>holding parley with their enemies. And thus people of your class are</p>
<p>the only ones remaining who are fitted by nature and education to take</p>
<p>part at once both in politics and philosophy. Here is Timaeus, of</p>
<p>Locris in Italy, a city which has admirable laws, and who is himself</p>
<p>in wealth and rank the equal of any of his fellow-citizens; he has</p>
<p>held the most important and honourable offices in his own state,</p>
<p>and, as I believe, has scaled the heights of all philosophy; and</p>
<p>here is Critias, whom every Athenian knows to be no novice in the</p>
<p>matters of which we are speaking; and as to, Hermocrates, I am assured</p>
<p>by many witnesses that his genius and education qualify him to take</p>
<p>part in any speculation of the kind. And therefore yesterday when I</p>
<p>saw that you wanted me to describe the formation of the State, I</p>
<p>readily assented, being very well aware, that, if you only would, none</p>
<p>were better qualified to carry the discussion further, and that when</p>
<p>you had engaged our city in a suitable war, you of all men living</p>
<p>could best exhibit her playing a fitting part. When I had completed my</p>
<p>task, I in return imposed this other task upon you. You conferred</p>
<p>together and agreed to entertain me to-day, as I had entertained</p>
<p>you, with a feast of discourse. Here am I in festive array, and no man</p>
<p>can be more ready for the promised banquet.</p>
<p>Her. And we too, Socrates, as Timaeus says, will not be wanting in</p>
<p>enthusiasm; and there is no excuse for not complying with your</p>
<p>request. As soon as we arrived yesterday at the guest-chamber of</p>
<p>Critias, with whom we are staying, or rather on our way thither, we</p>
<p>talked the matter over, and he told us an ancient tradition, which I</p>
<p>wish, Critias, that you would repeat to Socrates, so that he may</p>
<p>help us to judge whether it will satisfy his requirements or not.</p>
<p>Crit. I will, if Timaeus, who is our other partner, approves.</p>
<p>Tim. I quite approve.</p>
<p>Crit. Then listen, Socrates, to a tale which, though strange, is</p>
<p>certainly true, having been attested by Solon, who was the wisest of</p>
<p>the seven sages. He was a relative and a dear friend of my</p>
<p>great-grandfather, Dropides, as he himself says in many passages of</p>
<p>his poems; and he told the story to Critias, my grandfather, who</p>
<p>remembered and repeated it to us. There were of old, he said, great</p>
<p>and marvellous actions of the Athenian city, which have passed into</p>
<p>oblivion through lapse of time and the destruction of mankind, and one</p>
<p>in particular, greater than all the rest. This we will now rehearse.</p>
<p>It will be a fitting monument of our gratitude to you, and a hymn of</p>
<p>praise true and worthy of the goddess, on this her day of festival.</p>
<p>Soc. Very good. And what is this ancient famous action of the</p>
<p>Athenians, which Critias declared, on the authority of Solon, to be</p>
<p>not a mere legend, but an actual fact?</p>
<p>Crit. I will tell an old-world story which I heard from an aged man;</p>
<p>for Critias, at the time of telling it, was as he said, nearly</p>
<p>ninety years of age, and I was about ten. Now the day was that day</p>
<p>of the Apaturia which is called the Registration of Youth, at which,</p>
<p>according to custom, our parents gave prizes for recitations, and</p>
<p>the poems of several poets were recited by us boys, and many of us</p>
<p>sang the poems of Solon, which at that time had not gone out of</p>
<p>fashion. One of our tribe, either because he thought so or to please</p>
<p>Critias, said that in his judgment Solon was not only the wisest of</p>
<p>men, but also the noblest of poets. The old man, as I very well</p>
<p>remember, brightened up at hearing this and said, smiling: Yes,</p>
<p>Amynander, if Solon had only, like other poets, made poetry the</p>
<p>business of his life, and had completed the tale which he brought with</p>
<p>him from Egypt, and had not been compelled, by reason of the</p>
<p>factions and troubles which he found stirring in his own country</p>
<p>when he came home, to attend to other matters, in my opinion he</p>
<p>would have been as famous as Homer or Hesiod, or any poet.</p>
<p>And what was the tale about, Critias? said Amynander.</p>
<p>About the greatest action which the Athenians ever did, and which</p>
<p>ought to have been the most famous, but, through the lapse of time and</p>
<p>the destruction of the actors, it has not come down to us.</p>
<p>Tell us, said the other, the whole story, and how and from whom</p>
<p>Solon heard this veritable tradition.</p>
<p>He replied:-In the Egyptian Delta, at the head of which the river</p>
<p>Nile divides, there is a certain district which is called the district</p>
<p>of Sais, and the great city of the district is also called Sais, and</p>
<p>is the city from which King Amasis came. The citizens have a deity for</p>
<p>their foundress; she is called in the Egyptian tongue Neith, and is</p>
<p>asserted by them to be the same whom the Hellenes call Athene; they</p>
<p>are great lovers of the Athenians, and say that they are in some way</p>
<p>related to them. To this city came Solon, and was received there</p>
<p>with great honour; he asked the priests who were most skilful in</p>
<p>such matters, about antiquity, and made the discovery that neither</p>
<p>he nor any other Hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the</p>
<p>times of old. On one occasion, wishing to draw them on to speak of</p>
<p>antiquity, he began to tell about the most ancient things in our</p>
<p>part of the world-about Phoroneus, who is called &quot;the first man,&quot;</p>
<p>and about Niobe; and after the Deluge, of the survival of Deucalion</p>
<p>and Pyrrha; and he traced the genealogy of their descendants, and</p>
<p>reckoning up the dates, tried to compute how many years ago the events</p>
<p>of which he was speaking happened. Thereupon one of the priests, who</p>
<p>was of a very great age, said: O Solon, Solon, you Hellenes are</p>
<p>never anything but children, and there is not an old man among you.</p>
<p>Solon in return asked him what he meant. I mean to say, he replied,</p>
<p>that in mind you are all young; there is no old opinion handed down</p>
<p>among you by ancient tradition, nor any science which is hoary with</p>
<p>age. And I will tell you why. There have been, and will be again, many</p>
<p>destructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest</p>
<p>have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water, and other</p>
<p>lesser ones by innumerable other causes. There is a story, which</p>
<p>even you have preserved, that once upon a time Paethon, the son of</p>
<p>Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father&#x27;s chariot, because he</p>
<p>was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all</p>
<p>that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Now this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of</p>
<p>the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth, and a great</p>
<p>conflagration of things upon the earth, which recurs after long</p>
<p>intervals; at such times those who live upon the mountains and in</p>
<p>dry and lofty places are more liable to destruction than those who</p>
<p>dwell by rivers or on the seashore. And from this calamity the Nile,</p>
<p>who is our never-failing saviour, delivers and preserves us. When,</p>
<p>on the other hand, the gods purge the earth with a deluge of water,</p>
<p>the survivors in your country are herdsmen and shepherds who dwell</p>
<p>on the mountains, but those who, like you, live in cities are</p>
<p>carried by the rivers into the sea. Whereas in this land, neither then</p>
<p>nor at any other time, does the water come down from above on the</p>
<p>fields, having always a tendency to come up from below; for which</p>
<p>reason the traditions preserved here are the most ancient.</p>
<p>The fact is, that wherever the extremity of winter frost or of</p>
<p>summer does not prevent, mankind exist, sometimes in greater,</p>
<p>sometimes in lesser numbers. And whatever happened either in your</p>
<p>country or in ours, or in any other region of which we are informed-if</p>
<p>there were any actions noble or great or in any other way</p>
<p>remarkable, they have all been written down by us of old, and are</p>
<p>preserved in our temples. Whereas just when you and other nations</p>
<p>are beginning to be provided with letters and the other requisites</p>
<p>of civilized life, after the usual interval, the stream from heaven,</p>
<p>like a pestilence, comes pouring down, and leaves only those of you</p>
<p>who are destitute of letters and education; and so you have to begin</p>
<p>all over again like children, and know nothing of what happened in</p>
<p>ancient times, either among us or among yourselves. As for those</p>
<p>genealogies of yours which you just now recounted to us, Solon, they</p>
<p>are no better than the tales of children. In the first place you</p>
<p>remember a single deluge only, but there were many previous ones; in</p>
<p>the next place, you do not know that there formerly dwelt in your land</p>
<p>the fairest and noblest race of men which ever lived, and that you and</p>
<p>your whole city are descended from a small seed or remnant of them</p>
<p>which survived. And this was unknown to you, because, for many</p>
<p>generations, the survivors of that destruction died, leaving no</p>
<p>written word. For there was a time, Solon, before the great deluge</p>
<p>of all, when the city which now is Athens was first in war and in</p>
<p>every way the best governed of all cities, is said to have performed</p>
<p>the noblest deeds and to have had the fairest constitution of any of</p>
<p>which tradition tells, under the face of heaven.</p>
<p>Solon marvelled at his words, and earnestly requested the priests to</p>
<p>inform him exactly and in order about these former citizens. You are</p>
<p>welcome to hear about them, Solon, said the priest, both for your</p>
<p>own sake and for that of your city, and above all, for the sake of the</p>
<p>goddess who is the common patron and parent and educator of both our</p>
<p>cities. She founded your city a thousand years before ours,</p>
<p>receiving from the Earth and Hephaestus the seed of your race, and</p>
<p>afterwards she founded ours, of which the constitution is recorded</p>
<p>in our sacred registers to be eight thousand years old. As touching</p>
<p>your citizens of nine thousand years ago, I will briefly inform you of</p>
<p>their laws and of their most famous action; the exact particulars of</p>
<p>the whole we will hereafter go through at our leisure in the sacred</p>
<p>registers themselves. If you compare these very laws with ours you</p>
<p>will find that many of ours are the counterpart of yours as they</p>
<p>were in the olden time. In the first place, there is the caste of</p>
<p>priests, which is separated from all the others; next, there are the</p>
<p>artificers, who ply their several crafts by themselves and do not</p>
<p>intermix; and also there is the class of shepherds and of hunters,</p>
<p>as well as that of husbandmen; and you will observe, too, that the</p>
<p>warriors in Egypt are distinct from all the other classes, and are</p>
<p>commanded by the law to devote themselves solely to military pursuits;</p>
<p>moreover, the weapons which they carry are shields and spears, a style</p>
<p>of equipment which the goddess taught of Asiatics first to us, as in</p>
<p>your part of the world first to you. Then as to wisdom, do you observe</p>
<p>how our law from the very first made a study of the whole order of</p>
<p>things, extending even to prophecy and medicine which gives health,</p>
<p>out of these divine elements deriving what was needful for human life,</p>
<p>and adding every sort of knowledge which was akin to them. All this</p>
<p>order and arrangement the goddess first imparted to you when</p>
<p>establishing your city; and she chose the spot of earth in which you</p>
<p>were born, because she saw that the happy temperament of the seasons</p>
<p>in that land would produce the wisest of men. Wherefore the goddess,</p>
<p>who was a lover both of war and of wisdom, selected and first of all</p>
<p>settled that spot which was the most likely to produce men likest</p>
<p>herself. And there you dwelt, having such laws as these and still</p>
<p>better ones, and excelled all mankind in all virtue, as became the</p>
<p>children and disciples of the gods.</p>
<p>Many great and wonderful deeds are recorded of your state in our</p>
<p>histories. But one of them exceeds all the rest in greatness and</p>
<p>valour. For these histories tell of a mighty power which unprovoked</p>
<p>made an expedition against the whole of Europe and Asia, and to</p>
<p>which your city put an end. This power came forth out of the</p>
<p>Atlantic Ocean, for in those days the Atlantic was navigable; and</p>
<p>there was an island situated in front of the straits which are by</p>
<p>you called the Pillars of Heracles; the island was larger than Libya</p>
<p>and Asia put together, and was the way to other islands, and from</p>
<p>these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent which</p>
<p>surrounded the true ocean; for this sea which is within the Straits of</p>
<p>Heracles is only a harbour, having a narrow entrance, but that other</p>
<p>is a real sea, and the surrounding land may be most truly called a</p>
<p>boundless continent. Now in this island of Atlantis there was a</p>
<p>great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and</p>
<p>several others, and over parts of the continent, and, furthermore, the</p>
<p>men of Atlantis had subjected the parts of Libya within the columns of</p>
<p>Heracles as far as Egypt, and of Europe as far as Tyrrhenia. This vast</p>
<p>power, gathered into one, endeavoured to subdue at a blow our</p>
<p>country and yours and the whole of the region within the straits;</p>
<p>and then, Solon, your country shone forth, in the excellence of her</p>
<p>virtue and strength, among all mankind. She was pre-eminent in courage</p>
<p>and military skill, and was the leader of the Hellenes. And when the</p>
<p>rest fell off from her, being compelled to stand alone, after having</p>
<p>undergone the very extremity of danger, she defeated and triumphed</p>
<p>over the invaders, and preserved from slavery those who were not yet</p>
<p>subjugated, and generously liberated all the rest of us who dwell</p>
<p>within the pillars. But afterwards there occurred violent</p>
<p>earthquakes and floods; and in a single day and night of misfortune</p>
<p>all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth, and the island</p>
<p>of Atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea. For</p>
<p>which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable,</p>
<p>because there is a shoal of mud in the way; and this was caused by the</p>
<p>subsidence of the island.</p>
<p>I have told you briefly, Socrates, what the aged Critias heard</p>
<p>from Solon and related to us. And when you were speaking yesterday</p>
<p>about your city and citizens, the tale which I have just been</p>
<p>repeating to you came into my mind, and I remarked with astonishment</p>
<p>how, by some mysterious coincidence, you agreed in almost every</p>
<p>particular with the narrative of Solon; but I did not like to speak at</p>
<p>the moment. For a long time had elapsed, and I had forgotten too much;</p>
<p>I thought that I must first of all run over the narrative in my own</p>
<p>mind, and then I would speak. And so I readily assented to your</p>
<p>request yesterday, considering that in all such cases the chief</p>
<p>difficulty is to find a tale suitable to our purpose, and that with</p>
<p>such a tale we should be fairly well provided.</p>
<p>And therefore, as Hermocrates has told you, on my way home yesterday</p>
<p>I at once communicated the tale to my companions as I remembered it;</p>
<p>and after I left them, during the night by thinking I recovered nearly</p>
<p>the whole it. Truly, as is often said, the lessons of our childhood</p>
<p>make wonderful impression on our memories; for I am not sure that I</p>
<p>could remember all the discourse of yesterday, but I should be much</p>
<p>surprised if I forgot any of these things which I have heard very long</p>
<p>ago. I listened at the time with childlike interest to the old man&#x27;s</p>
<p>narrative; he was very ready to teach me, and I asked him again and</p>
<p>again to repeat his words, so that like an indelible picture they were</p>
<p>branded into my mind. As soon as the day broke, I rehearsed them as he</p>
<p>spoke them to my companions, that they, as well as myself, might</p>
<p>have something to say. And now, Socrates, to make an end my preface, I</p>
<p>am ready to tell you the whole tale. I will give you not only the</p>
<p>general heads, but the particulars, as they were told to me. The</p>
<p>city and citizens, which you yesterday described to us in fiction,</p>
<p>we will now transfer to the world of reality. It shall be the</p>
<p>ancient city of Athens, and we will suppose that the citizens whom you</p>
<p>imagined, were our veritable ancestors, of whom the priest spoke; they</p>
<p>will perfectly harmonise, and there will be no inconsistency in saying</p>
<p>that the citizens of your republic are these ancient Athenians. Let us</p>
<p>divide the subject among us, and all endeavour according to our</p>
<p>ability gracefully to execute the task which you have imposed upon us.</p>
<p>Consider then, Socrates, if this narrative is suited to the purpose,</p>
<p>or whether we should seek for some other instead.</p>
<p>Soc. And what other, Critias, can we find that will be better than</p>
<p>this, which is natural and suitable to the festival of the goddess,</p>
<p>and has the very great advantage of being a fact and not a fiction?</p>
<p>How or where shall we find another if we abandon this? We cannot,</p>
<p>and therefore you must tell the tale, and good luck to you; and I in</p>
<p>return for my yesterday&#x27;s discourse will now rest and be a listener.</p>
<p>Crit. Let me proceed to explain to you, Socrates, the order in which</p>
<p>we have arranged our entertainment. Our intention is, that Timaeus,</p>
<p>who is the most of an astronomer amongst us, and has made the nature</p>
<p>of the universe his special study, should speak first, beginning</p>
<p>with the generation of the world and going down to the creation of</p>
<p>man; next, I am to receive the men whom he has created of whom some</p>
<p>will have profited by the excellent education which you have given</p>
<p>them; and then, in accordance with the tale of Solon, and equally with</p>
<p>his law, we will bring them into court and make them citizens, as if</p>
<p>they were those very Athenians whom the sacred Egyptian record has</p>
<p>recovered from oblivion, and thenceforward we will speak of them as</p>
<p>Athenians and fellow-citizens.</p>
<p>Soc. I see that I shall receive in my turn a perfect and splendid</p>
<p>feast of reason. And now, Timaeus, you, I suppose, should speak</p>
<p>next, after duly calling upon the Gods.</p>
<p>Tim. All men, Socrates, who have any degree of right feeling, at the</p>
<p>beginning of every enterprise, whether small or great, always call</p>
<p>upon God. And we, too, who are going to discourse of the nature of the</p>
<p>universe, how created or how existing without creation, if we be not</p>
<p>altogether out of our wits, must invoke the aid of Gods and</p>
<p>Goddesses and pray that our words may be acceptable to them and</p>
<p>consistent with themselves. Let this, then, be our invocation of the</p>
<p>Gods, to which I add an exhortation of myself to speak in such</p>
<p>manner as will be most intelligible to you, and will most accord</p>
<p>with my own intent.</p>
<p>First then, in my judgment, we must make a distinction and ask, What</p>
<p>is that which always is and has no becoming; and what is that which is</p>
<p>always becoming and never is? That which is apprehended by</p>
<p>intelligence and reason is always in the same state; but that which is</p>
<p>conceived by opinion with the help of sensation and without reason, is</p>
<p>always in a process of becoming and perishing and never really is. Now</p>
<p>everything that becomes or is created must of necessity be created</p>
<p>by some cause, for without a cause nothing can be created. The work of</p>
<p>the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the</p>
<p>form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must</p>
<p>necessarily be made fair and perfect; but when he looks to the created</p>
<p>only, and uses a created pattern, it is not fair or perfect. Was the</p>
<p>heaven then or the world, whether called by this or by any other</p>
<p>more appropriate name-assuming the name, I am asking a question</p>
<p>which has to be asked at the beginning of an enquiry about</p>
<p>anything-was the world, I say, always in existence and without</p>
<p>beginning? or created, and had it a beginning? Created, I reply, being</p>
<p>visible and tangible and having a body, and therefore sensible; and</p>
<p>all sensible things are apprehended by opinion and sense and are in</p>
<p>a process of creation and created. Now that which is created must,</p>
<p>as we affirm, of necessity be created by a cause. But the father and</p>
<p>maker of all this universe is past finding out; and even if we found</p>
<p>him, to tell of him to all men would be impossible. And there is still</p>
<p>a question to be asked about him: Which of the patterns had the</p>
<p>artificer in view when he made the world-the pattern of the</p>
<p>unchangeable, or of that which is created? If the world be indeed fair</p>
<p>and the artificer good, it is manifest that he must have looked to</p>
<p>that which is eternal; but if what cannot be said without blasphemy is</p>
<p>true, then to the created pattern. Every one will see that he must</p>
<p>have looked to, the eternal; for the world is the fairest of creations</p>
<p>and he is the best of causes. And having been created in this way, the</p>
<p>world has been framed in the likeness of that which is apprehended</p>
<p>by reason and mind and is unchangeable, and must therefore of</p>
<p>necessity, if this is admitted, be a copy of something. Now it is</p>
<p>all-important that the beginning of everything should be according</p>
<p>to nature. And in speaking of the copy and the original we may</p>
<p>assume that words are akin to the matter which they describe; when</p>
<p>they relate to the lasting and permanent and intelligible, they</p>
<p>ought to be lasting and unalterable, and, as far as their nature</p>
<p>allows, irrefutable and immovable-nothing less. But when they</p>
<p>express only the copy or likeness and not the eternal things</p>
<p>themselves, they need only be likely and analogous to the real</p>
<p>words. As being is to becoming, so is truth to belief. If then,</p>
<p>Socrates, amid the many opinions about the gods and the generation</p>
<p>of the universe, we are not able to give notions which are</p>
<p>altogether and in every respect exact and consistent with one another,</p>
<p>do not be surprised. Enough, if we adduce probabilities as likely as</p>
<p>any others; for we must remember that I who am the speaker, and you</p>
<p>who are the judges, are only mortal men, and we ought to accept the</p>
<p>tale which is probable and enquire no further.</p>
<p>Soc. Excellent, Timaeus; and we will do precisely as you bid us. The</p>
<p>prelude is charming, and is already accepted by us-may we beg of you</p>
<p>to proceed to the strain?</p>
<p>Tim. Let me tell you then why the creator made this world of</p>
<p>generation. He was good, and the good can never have any jealousy of</p>
<p>anything. And being free from jealousy, he desired that all things</p>
<p>should be as like himself as they could be. This is in the truest</p>
<p>sense the origin of creation and of the world, as we shall do well</p>
<p>in believing on the testimony of wise men: God desired that all things</p>
<p>should be good and nothing bad, so far as this was attainable.</p>
<p>Wherefore also finding the whole visible sphere not at rest, but</p>
<p>moving in an irregular and disorderly fashion, out of disorder he</p>
<p>brought order, considering that this was in every way better than</p>
<p>the other. Now the deeds of the best could never be or have been other</p>
<p>than the fairest; and the creator, reflecting on the things which</p>
<p>are by nature visible, found that no unintelligent creature taken as a</p>
<p>whole was fairer than the intelligent taken as a whole; and that</p>
<p>intelligence could not be present in anything which was devoid of</p>
<p>soul. For which reason, when he was framing the universe, he put</p>
<p>intelligence in soul, and soul in body, that he might be the creator</p>
<p>of a work which was by nature fairest and best. Wherefore, using the</p>
<p>language of probability, we may say that the world became a living</p>
<p>creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by the providence of</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>This being supposed, let us proceed to the next stage: In the</p>
<p>likeness of what animal did the Creator make the world? It would be an</p>
<p>unworthy thing to liken it to any nature which exists as a part</p>
<p>only; for nothing can be beautiful which is like any imperfect</p>
<p>thing; but let us suppose the world to be the very image of that whole</p>
<p>of which all other animals both individually and in their tribes are</p>
<p>portions. For the original of the universe contains in itself all</p>
<p>intelligible beings, just as this world comprehends us and all other</p>
<p>visible creatures. For the Deity, intending to make this world like</p>
<p>the fairest and most perfect of intelligible beings, framed one</p>
<p>visible animal comprehending within itself all other animals of a</p>
<p>kindred nature. Are we right in saying that there is one world, or</p>
<p>that they are many and infinite? There must be one only, if the</p>
<p>created copy is to accord with the original. For that which includes</p>
<p>all other intelligible creatures cannot have a second or companion; in</p>
<p>that case there would be need of another living being which would</p>
<p>include both, and of which they would be parts, and the likeness would</p>
<p>be more truly said to resemble not them, but that other which included</p>
<p>them. In order then that the world might be solitary, like the perfect</p>
<p>animal, the creator made not two worlds or an infinite number of them;</p>
<p>but there is and ever will be one only-begotten and created heaven.</p>
<p>Now that which is created is of necessity corporeal, and also</p>
<p>visible and tangible. And nothing is visible where there is no fire,</p>
<p>or tangible which has no solidity, and nothing is solid without earth.</p>
<p>Wherefore also God in the beginning of creation made the body of the</p>
<p>universe to consist of fire and earth. But two things cannot be</p>
<p>rightly put together without a third; there must be some bond of union</p>
<p>between them. And the fairest bond is that which makes the most</p>
<p>complete fusion of itself and the things which it combines; and</p>
<p>proportion is best adapted to effect such a union. For whenever in any</p>
<p>three numbers, whether cube or square, there is a mean, which is to</p>
<p>the last term what the first term is to it; and again, when the mean</p>
<p>is to the first term as the last term is to the mean-then the mean</p>
<p>becoming first and last, and the first and last both becoming means,</p>
<p>they will all of them of necessity come to be the same, and having</p>
<p>become the same with one another will be all one. If the universal</p>
<p>frame had been created a surface only and having no depth, a single</p>
<p>mean would have sufficed to bind together itself and the other</p>
<p>terms; but now, as the world must be solid, and solid bodies are</p>
<p>always compacted not by one mean but by two, God placed water and</p>
<p>air in the mean between fire and earth, and made them to have the same</p>
<p>proportion so far as was possible (as fire is to air so is air to</p>
<p>water, and as air is to water so is water to earth); and thus he bound</p>
<p>and put together a visible and tangible heaven. And for these reasons,</p>
<p>and out of such elements which are in number four, the body of the</p>
<p>world was created, and it was harmonised by proportion, and</p>
<p>therefore has the spirit of friendship; and having been reconciled</p>
<p>to itself, it was indissoluble by the hand of any other than the</p>
<p>framer.</p>
<p>Now the creation took up the whole of each of the four elements; for</p>
<p>the Creator compounded the world out of all the fire and all the water</p>
<p>and all the air and all the earth, leaving no part of any of them</p>
<p>nor any power of them outside. His intention was, in the first</p>
<p>place, that the animal should be as far as possible a perfect whole</p>
<p>and of perfect parts: secondly, that it should be one, leaving no</p>
<p>remnants out of which another such world might be created: and also</p>
<p>that it should be free from old age and unaffected by disease.</p>
<p>Considering that if heat and cold and other powerful forces which</p>
<p>unite bodies surround and attack them from without when they are</p>
<p>unprepared, they decompose them, and by bringing diseases and old</p>
<p>age upon them, make them waste away-for this cause and on these</p>
<p>grounds he made the world one whole, having every part entire, and</p>
<p>being therefore perfect and not liable to old age and disease. And</p>
<p>he gave to the world the figure which was suitable and also natural.</p>
<p>Now to the animal which was to comprehend all animals, that figure was</p>
<p>suitable which comprehends within itself all other figures.</p>
<p>Wherefore he made the world in the form of a globe, round as from a</p>
<p>lathe, having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the</p>
<p>centre, the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures;</p>
<p>for he considered that the like is infinitely fairer than the</p>
<p>unlike. This he finished off, making the surface smooth all around for</p>
<p>many reasons; in the first place, because the living being had no need</p>
<p>of eyes when there was nothing remaining outside him to be seen; nor</p>
<p>of ears when there was nothing to be heard; and there was no</p>
<p>surrounding atmosphere to be breathed; nor would there have been any</p>
<p>use of organs by the help of which he might receive his food or get</p>
<p>rid of what he had already digested, since there was nothing which</p>
<p>went from him or came into him: for there was nothing beside him. Of</p>
<p>design he was created thus, his own waste providing his own food,</p>
<p>and all that he did or suffered taking place in and by himself. For</p>
<p>the Creator conceived that a being which was self-sufficient would</p>
<p>be far more excellent than one which lacked anything; and, as he had</p>
<p>no need to take anything or defend himself against any one, the</p>
<p>Creator did not think it necessary to bestow upon him hands: nor had</p>
<p>he any need of feet, nor of the whole apparatus of walking; but the</p>
<p>movement suited to his spherical form was assigned to him, being of</p>
<p>all the seven that which is most appropriate to mind and intelligence;</p>
<p>and he was made to move in the same manner and on the same spot,</p>
<p>within his own limits revolving in a circle. All the other six motions</p>
<p>were taken away from him, and he was made not to partake of their</p>
<p>deviations. And as this circular movement required no feet, the</p>
<p>universe was created without legs and without feet.</p>
<p>Such was the whole plan of the eternal God about the god that was to</p>
<p>be, to whom for this reason he gave a body, smooth and even, having</p>
<p>a surface in every direction equidistant from the centre, a body</p>
<p>entire and perfect, and formed out of perfect bodies. And in the</p>
<p>centre he put the soul, which he diffused throughout the body,</p>
<p>making it also to be the exterior environment of it; and he made the</p>
<p>universe a circle moving in a circle, one and solitary, yet by</p>
<p>reason of its excellence able to converse with itself, and needing</p>
<p>no other friendship or acquaintance. Having these purposes in view</p>
<p>he created the world a blessed god.</p>
<p>Now God did not make the soul after the body, although we are</p>
<p>speaking of them in this order; for having brought them together he</p>
<p>would never have allowed that the elder should be ruled by the</p>
<p>younger; but this is a random manner of speaking which we have,</p>
<p>because somehow we ourselves too are very much under the dominion of</p>
<p>chance. Whereas he made the soul in origin and excellence prior to and</p>
<p>older than the body, to be the ruler and mistress, of whom the body</p>
<p>was to be the subject. And he made her out of the following elements</p>
<p>and on this wise: Out of the indivisible and unchangeable, and also</p>
<p>out of that which is divisible and has to do with material bodies,</p>
<p>he compounded a third and intermediate kind of essence, partaking of</p>
<p>the nature of the same and of the other, and this compound he placed</p>
<p>accordingly in a mean between the indivisible, and the divisible and</p>
<p>material. He took the three elements of the same, the other, and the</p>
<p>essence, and mingled them into one form, compressing by force the</p>
<p>reluctant and unsociable nature of the other into the same. When he</p>
<p>had mingled them with the essence and out of three made one, he</p>
<p>again divided this whole into as many portions as was fitting, each</p>
<p>portion being a compound of the same, the other, and the essence.</p>
<p>And he proceeded to divide after this manner:-First of all, he took</p>
<p>away one part of the whole [1], and then he separated a second part</p>
<p>which was double the first [2], and then he took away a third part</p>
<p>which was half as much again as the second and three times as much</p>
<p>as the first [3], and then he took a fourth part which was twice as</p>
<p>much as the second [4], and a fifth part which was three times the</p>
<p>third [9], and a sixth part which was eight times the first [8], and a</p>
<p>seventh part which was twenty-seven times the first [27]. After this</p>
<p>he filled up the double intervals [i.e. between 1, 2, 4, 8] and the</p>
<p>triple [i.e. between 1, 3, 9, 27] cutting off yet other portions</p>
<p>from the mixture and placing them in the intervals, so that in each</p>
<p>interval there were two kinds of means, the one exceeding and exceeded</p>
<p>by equal parts of its extremes [as for example 1, 4/3, 2, in which the</p>
<p>mean 4/3 is one-third of 1 more than 1, and one-third of 2 less than</p>
<p>2], the other being that kind of mean which exceeds and is exceeded by</p>
<p>an equal number. Where there were intervals of 3/2 and of 4/3 and of</p>
<p>9/8, made by the connecting terms in the former intervals, he filled</p>
<p>up all the intervals of 4/3 with the interval of 9/8, leaving a</p>
<p>fraction over; and the interval which this fraction expressed was in</p>
<p>the ratio of 256 to 243. And thus the whole mixture out of which he</p>
<p>cut these portions was all exhausted by him. This entire compound he</p>
<p>divided lengthways into two parts, which he joined to one another at</p>
<p>the centre like the letter X, and bent them into a circular form,</p>
<p>connecting them with themselves and each other at the point opposite</p>
<p>to their original meeting-point; and, comprehending them in a</p>
<p>uniform revolution upon the same axis, he made the one the outer and</p>
<p>the other the inner circle. Now the motion of the outer circle he</p>
<p>called the motion of the same, and the motion of the inner circle</p>
<p>the motion of the other or diverse. The motion of the same he</p>
<p>carried round by the side to the right, and the motion of the</p>
<p>diverse diagonally to the left. And he gave dominion to the motion</p>
<p>of the same and like, for that he left single and undivided; but the</p>
<p>inner motion he divided in six places and made seven unequal circles</p>
<p>having their intervals in ratios of two-and three, three of each,</p>
<p>and bade the orbits proceed in a direction opposite to one another;</p>
<p>and three [Sun, Mercury, Venus] he made to move with equal</p>
<p>swiftness, and the remaining four [Moon, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter] to</p>
<p>move with unequal swiftness to the three and to one another, but in</p>
<p>due proportion.</p>
<p>Now when the Creator had framed the soul according to his will, he</p>
<p>formed within her the corporeal universe, and brought the two</p>
<p>together, and united them centre to centre. The soul, interfused</p>
<p>everywhere from the centre to the circumference of heaven, of which</p>
<p>also she is the external envelopment, herself turning in herself,</p>
<p>began a divine beginning of never ceasing and rational life enduring</p>
<p>throughout all time. The body of heaven is visible, but the soul is</p>
<p>invisible, and partakes of reason and harmony, and being made by the</p>
<p>best of intellectual and everlasting natures, is the best of things</p>
<p>created. And because she is composed of the same and of the other</p>
<p>and of the essence, these three, and is divided and united in due</p>
<p>proportion, and in her revolutions returns upon herself, the soul,</p>
<p>when touching anything which has essence, whether dispersed in parts</p>
<p>or undivided, is stirred through all her powers, to declare the</p>
<p>sameness or difference of that thing and some other; and to what</p>
<p>individuals are related, and by what affected, and in what way and how</p>
<p>and when, both in the world of generation and in the world of</p>
<p>immutable being. And when reason, which works with equal truth,</p>
<p>whether she be in the circle of the diverse or of the same-in</p>
<p>voiceless silence holding her onward course in the sphere of the</p>
<p>self-moved-when reason, I say, is hovering around the sensible world</p>
<p>and when the circle of the diverse also moving truly imparts the</p>
<p>intimations of sense to the whole soul, then arise opinions and</p>
<p>beliefs sure and certain. But when reason is concerned with the</p>
<p>rational, and the circle of the same moving smoothly declares it, then</p>
<p>intelligence and knowledge are necessarily perfected. And if any one</p>
<p>affirms that in which these two are found to be other than the soul,</p>
<p>he will say the very opposite of the truth.</p>
<p>When the father creator saw the creature which he had made moving</p>
<p>and living, the created image of the eternal gods, he rejoiced, and in</p>
<p>his joy determined to make the copy still more like the original;</p>
<p>and as this was eternal, he sought to make the universe eternal, so</p>
<p>far as might be. Now the nature of the ideal being was everlasting,</p>
<p>but to bestow this attribute in its fulness upon a creature was</p>
<p>impossible. Wherefore he resolved to have a moving image of</p>
<p>eternity, and when he set in order the heaven, he made this image</p>
<p>eternal but moving according to number, while eternity itself rests in</p>
<p>unity; and this image we call time. For there were no days and</p>
<p>nights and months and years before the heaven was created, but when he</p>
<p>constructed the heaven he created them also. They are all parts of</p>
<p>time, and the past and future are created species of time, which we</p>
<p>unconsciously but wrongly transfer to the eternal essence; for we</p>
<p>say that he &quot;was,&quot; he &quot;is,&quot; he &quot;will be,&quot; but the truth is that &quot;is&quot;</p>
<p>alone is properly attributed to him, and that &quot;was&quot; and &quot;will be&quot; only</p>
<p>to be spoken of becoming in time, for they are motions, but that which</p>
<p>is immovably the same cannot become older or younger by time, nor ever</p>
<p>did or has become, or hereafter will be, older or younger, nor is</p>
<p>subject at all to any of those states which affect moving and sensible</p>
<p>things and of which generation is the cause. These are the forms of</p>
<p>time, which imitates eternity and revolves according to a law of</p>
<p>number. Moreover, when we say that what has become is become and</p>
<p>what becomes is becoming, and that what will become is about to become</p>
<p>and that the non-existent is non-existent-all these are inaccurate</p>
<p>modes of expression. But perhaps this whole subject will be more</p>
<p>suitably discussed on some other occasion.</p>
<p>Time, then, and the heaven came into being at the same instant in</p>
<p>order that, having been created together, if ever there was to be a</p>
<p>dissolution of them, they might be dissolved together. It was framed</p>
<p>after the pattern of the eternal nature, that it might resemble this</p>
<p>as far as was possible; for the pattern exists from eternity, and</p>
<p>the created heaven has been, and is, and will be, in all time. Such</p>
<p>was the mind and thought of God in the creation of time. The sun and</p>
<p>moon and five other stars, which are called the planets, were</p>
<p>created by him in order to distinguish and preserve the numbers of</p>
<p>time; and when he had made-their several bodies, he placed them in the</p>
<p>orbits in which the circle of the other was revolving-in seven</p>
<p>orbits seven stars. First, there was the moon in the orbit nearest the</p>
<p>earth, and next the sun, in the second orbit above the earth; then</p>
<p>came the morning star and the star sacred to Hermes, moving in</p>
<p>orbits which have an equal swiftness with the sun, but in an</p>
<p>opposite direction; and this is the reason why the sun and Hermes</p>
<p>and Lucifer overtake and are overtaken by each other. To enumerate the</p>
<p>places which he assigned to the other stars, and to give all the</p>
<p>reasons why he assigned them, although a secondary matter, would</p>
<p>give more trouble than the primary. These things at some future</p>
<p>time, when we are at leisure, may have the consideration which they</p>
<p>deserve, but not at present.</p>
<p>Now, when all the stars which were necessary to the creation of time</p>
<p>had attained a motion suitable to them,-and had become living</p>
<p>creatures having bodies fastened by vital chains, and learnt their</p>
<p>appointed task, moving in the motion of the diverse, which is</p>
<p>diagonal, and passes through and is governed by the motion of the</p>
<p>same, they revolved, some in a larger and some in a lesser orbit-those</p>
<p>which had the lesser orbit revolving faster, and those which had the</p>
<p>larger more slowly. Now by reason of the motion of the same, those</p>
<p>which revolved fastest appeared to be overtaken by those which moved</p>
<p>slower although they really overtook them; for the motion of the</p>
<p>same made them all turn in a spiral, and, because some went one way</p>
<p>and some another, that which receded most slowly from the sphere of</p>
<p>the same, which was the swiftest, appeared to follow it most nearly.</p>
<p>That there might be some visible measure of their relative swiftness</p>
<p>and slowness as they proceeded in their eight courses, God lighted a</p>
<p>fire, which we now call the sun, in the second from the earth of these</p>
<p>orbits, that it might give light to the whole of heaven, and that</p>
<p>the animals, as many as nature intended, might participate in</p>
<p>number, learning arithmetic from the revolution of the same and the</p>
<p>like. Thus then, and for this reason the night and the day were</p>
<p>created, being the period of the one most intelligent revolution.</p>
<p>And the month is accomplished when the moon has completed her orbit</p>
<p>and overtaken the sun, and the year when the sun has completed his own</p>
<p>orbit. Mankind, with hardly an exception, have not remarked the</p>
<p>periods of the other stars, and they have no name for them, and do not</p>
<p>measure them against one another by the help of number, and hence they</p>
<p>can scarcely be said to know that their wanderings, being infinite</p>
<p>in number and admirable for their variety, make up time. And yet there</p>
<p>is no difficulty in seeing that the perfect number of time fulfils the</p>
<p>perfect year when all the eight revolutions, having their relative</p>
<p>degrees of swiftness, are accomplished together and attain their</p>
<p>completion at the same time, measured by the rotation of the same</p>
<p>and equally moving. After this manner, and for these reasons, came</p>
<p>into being such of the stars as in their heavenly progress received</p>
<p>reversals of motion, to the end that the created heaven might</p>
<p>imitate the eternal nature, and be as like as possible to the</p>
<p>perfect and intelligible animal.</p>
<p>Thus far and until the birth of time the created universe was made</p>
<p>in the likeness of the original, but inasmuch as all animals were</p>
<p>not yet comprehended therein, it was still unlike. What remained,</p>
<p>the creator then proceeded to fashion after the nature of the pattern.</p>
<p>Now as in the ideal animal the mind perceives ideas or species of a</p>
<p>certain nature and number, he thought that this created animal ought</p>
<p>to have species of a like nature and number. There are four such;</p>
<p>one of them is the heavenly race of the gods; another, the race of</p>
<p>birds whose way is in the air; the third, the watery species; and</p>
<p>the fourth, the pedestrian and land creatures. Of the heavenly and</p>
<p>divine, he created the greater part out of fire, that they might be</p>
<p>the brightest of all things and fairest to behold, and he fashioned</p>
<p>them after the likeness of the universe in the figure of a circle, and</p>
<p>made them follow the intelligent motion of the supreme, distributing</p>
<p>them over the whole circumference of heaven, which was to be a true</p>
<p>cosmos or glorious world spangled with them all over. And he gave to</p>
<p>each of them two movements: the first, a movement on the same spot</p>
<p>after the same manner, whereby they ever continue to think</p>
<p>consistently the same thoughts about the same things; the second, a</p>
<p>forward movement, in which they are controlled by the revolution of</p>
<p>the same and the like; but by the other five motions they were</p>
<p>unaffected, in order that each of them might attain the highest</p>
<p>perfection. And for this reason the fixed stars were created, to be</p>
<p>divine and eternal animals, ever-abiding and revolving after the</p>
<p>same manner and on the same spot; and the other stars which reverse</p>
<p>their motion and are subject to deviations of this kind, were</p>
<p>created in the manner already described. The earth, which is our</p>
<p>nurse, clinging around the pole which is extended through the</p>
<p>universe, he framed to be the guardian and artificer of night and day,</p>
<p>first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of heaven. Vain</p>
<p>would be the attempt to tell all the figures of them circling as in</p>
<p>dance, and their juxtapositions, and the return of them in their</p>
<p>revolutions upon themselves, and their approximations, and to say</p>
<p>which of these deities in their conjunctions meet, and which of them</p>
<p>are in opposition, and in what order they get behind and before one</p>
<p>another, and when they are severally eclipsed to our sight and again</p>
<p>reappear, sending terrors and intimations of the future to those who</p>
<p>cannot calculate their movements-to attempt to tell of all this</p>
<p>without a visible representation of the heavenly system would be</p>
<p>labour in vain. Enough on this head; and now let what we have said</p>
<p>about the nature of the created and visible gods have an end.</p>
<p>To know or tell the origin of the other divinities is beyond us, and</p>
<p>we must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm</p>
<p>themselves to be the offspring of the gods-that is what they say-and</p>
<p>they must surely have known their own ancestors. How can we doubt</p>
<p>the word of the children of the gods? Although they give no probable</p>
<p>or certain proofs, still, as they declare that they are speaking of</p>
<p>what took place in their own family, we must conform to custom and</p>
<p>believe them. In this manner, then, according to them, the genealogy</p>
<p>of these gods is to be received and set forth.</p>
<p>Oceanus and Tethys were the children of Earth and Heaven, and from</p>
<p>these sprang Phorcys and Cronos and Rhea, and all that generation; and</p>
<p>from Cronos and Rhea sprang Zeus and Here, and all those who are</p>
<p>said to be their brethren, and others who were the children of these.</p>
<p>Now, when all of them, both those who visibly appear in their</p>
<p>revolutions as well as those other gods who are of a more retiring</p>
<p>nature, had come into being, the creator of the universe addressed</p>
<p>them in these words: &quot;Gods, children of gods, who are my works, and of</p>
<p>whom I am the artificer and father, my creations are indissoluble,</p>
<p>if so I will. All that is bound may be undone, but only an evil</p>
<p>being would wish to undo that which is harmonious and happy.</p>
<p>Wherefore, since ye are but creatures, ye are not altogether</p>
<p>immortal and indissoluble, but ye shall certainly not be dissolved,</p>
<p>nor be liable to the fate of death, having in my will a greater and</p>
<p>mightier bond than those with which ye were bound at the time of</p>
<p>your birth. And now listen to my instructions:-Three tribes of</p>
<p>mortal beings remain to be created-without them the universe will be</p>
<p>incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it</p>
<p>ought to contain, if it is to be perfect. On the other hand, if they</p>
<p>were created by me and received life at my hands, they would be on</p>
<p>an equality with the gods. In order then that they may be mortal,</p>
<p>and that this universe may be truly universal, do ye, according to</p>
<p>your natures, betake yourselves to the formation of animals, imitating</p>
<p>the power which was shown by me in creating you. The part of them</p>
<p>worthy of the name immortal, which is called divine and is the guiding</p>
<p>principle of those who are willing to follow justice and you-of that</p>
<p>divine part I will myself sow the seed, and having made a beginning, I</p>
<p>will hand the work over to you. And do ye then interweave the mortal</p>
<p>with the immortal, and make and beget living creatures, and give</p>
<p>them food, and make them to grow, and receive them again in death.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus he spake, and once more into the cup in which he had previously</p>
<p>mingled the soul of the universe he poured the remains of the</p>
<p>elements, and mingled them in much the same manner; they were not,</p>
<p>however, pure as before, but diluted to the second and third degree.</p>
<p>And having made it he divided the whole mixture into souls equal in</p>
<p>number to the stars, and assigned each soul to a star; and having</p>
<p>there placed them as in a chariot, he showed them the nature of the</p>
<p>universe, and declared to them the laws of destiny, according to which</p>
<p>their first birth would be one and the same for all,-no one should</p>
<p>suffer a disadvantage at his hands; they were to be sown in the</p>
<p>instruments of time severally adapted to them, and to come forth the</p>
<p>most religious of animals; and as human nature was of two kinds, the</p>
<p>superior race would here after be called man. Now, when they should be</p>
<p>implanted in bodies by necessity, and be always gaining or losing some</p>
<p>part of their bodily substance, then in the first place it would be</p>
<p>necessary that they should all have in them one and the same faculty</p>
<p>of sensation, arising out of irresistible impressions; in the second</p>
<p>place, they must have love, in which pleasure and pain mingle; also</p>
<p>fear and anger, and the feelings which are akin or opposite to them;</p>
<p>if they conquered these they would live righteously, and if they</p>
<p>were conquered by them, unrighteously. He who lived well during his</p>
<p>appointed time was to return and dwell in his native star, and there</p>
<p>he would have a blessed and congenial existence. But if he failed in</p>
<p>attaining this, at the second birth he would pass into a woman, and</p>
<p>if, when in that state of being, he did not desist from evil, he would</p>
<p>continually be changed into some brute who resembled him in the evil</p>
<p>nature which he had acquired, and would not cease from his toils and</p>
<p>transformations until he followed the revolution of the same and the</p>
<p>like within him, and overcame by the help of reason the turbulent</p>
<p>and irrational mob of later accretions, made up of fire and air and</p>
<p>water and earth, and returned to the form of his first and better</p>
<p>state. Having given all these laws to his creatures, that he might</p>
<p>be guiltless of future evil in any of them, the creator sowed some</p>
<p>of them in the earth, and some in the moon, and some in the other</p>
<p>instruments of time; and when he had sown them he committed to the</p>
<p>younger gods the fashioning of their mortal bodies, and desired them</p>
<p>to furnish what was still lacking to the human soul, and having made</p>
<p>all the suitable additions, to rule over them, and to pilot the mortal</p>
<p>animal in the best and wisest manner which they could, and avert</p>
<p>from him all but self-inflicted evils.</p>
<p>When the creator had made all these ordinances he remained in his</p>
<p>own accustomed nature, and his children heard and were obedient to</p>
<p>their father&#x27;s word, and receiving from him the immortal principle</p>
<p>of a mortal creature, in imitation of their own creator they</p>
<p>borrowed portions of fire, and earth, and water, and air from the</p>
<p>world, which were hereafter to be restored-these they took and</p>
<p>welded them together, not with the indissoluble chains by which they</p>
<p>were themselves bound, but with little pegs too small to be visible,</p>
<p>making up out of all the four elements each separate body, and</p>
<p>fastening the courses of the immortal soul in a body which was in a</p>
<p>state of perpetual influx and efflux. Now these courses, detained as</p>
<p>in a vast river, neither overcame nor were overcome; but were hurrying</p>
<p>and hurried to and fro, so that the whole animal was moved and</p>
<p>progressed, irregularly however and irrationally and anyhow, in all</p>
<p>the six directions of motion, wandering backwards and forwards, and</p>
<p>right and left, and up and down, and in all the six directions. For</p>
<p>great as was the advancing and retiring flood which provided</p>
<p>nourishment, the affections produced by external contact caused</p>
<p>still greater tumult-when the body of any one met and came into</p>
<p>collision with some external fire, or with the solid earth or the</p>
<p>gliding waters, or was caught in the tempest borne on the air, and the</p>
<p>motions produced by any of these impulses were carried through the</p>
<p>body to the soul. All such motions have consequently received the</p>
<p>general name of &quot;sensations,&quot; which they still retain. And they did in</p>
<p>fact at that time create a very great and mighty movement; uniting</p>
<p>with the ever flowing stream in stirring up and violently shaking</p>
<p>the courses of the soul, they completely stopped the revolution of the</p>
<p>same by their opposing current, and hindered it from predominating and</p>
<p>advancing; and they so disturbed the nature of the other or diverse,</p>
<p>that the three double intervals [i.e. between 1, 2, 4, 8], and the</p>
<p>three triple intervals [i.e. between 1, 3, 9, 27], together with the</p>
<p>mean terms and connecting links which are expressed by the ratios of 3</p>
<p>: 2, and 4 : 3, and of 9 : 8-these, although they cannot be wholly</p>
<p>undone except by him who united them, were twisted by them in all</p>
<p>sorts of ways, and the circles were broken and disordered in every</p>
<p>possible manner, so that when they moved they were tumbling to pieces,</p>
<p>and moved irrationally, at one time in a reverse direction, and then</p>
<p>again obliquely, and then upside down, as you might imagine a person</p>
<p>who is upside down and has his head leaning upon the ground and his</p>
<p>feet up against something in the air; and when he is in such a</p>
<p>position, both he and the spectator fancy that the right of either</p>
<p>is his left, and left right. If, when powerfully experiencing these</p>
<p>and similar effects, the revolutions of the soul come in contact</p>
<p>with some external thing, either of the class of the same or of the</p>
<p>other, they speak of the same or of the other in a manner the very</p>
<p>opposite of the truth; and they become false and foolish, and there is</p>
<p>no course or revolution in them which has a guiding or directing</p>
<p>power; and if again any sensations enter in violently from without and</p>
<p>drag after them the whole vessel of the soul, then the courses of</p>
<p>the soul, though they seem to conquer, are really conquered.</p>
<p>And by reason of all these affections, the soul, when encased in a</p>
<p>mortal body, now, as in the beginning, is at first without</p>
<p>intelligence; but when the flood of growth and nutriment abates, and</p>
<p>the courses of the soul, calming down, go their own way and become</p>
<p>steadier as time goes on, then the several circles return to their</p>
<p>natural form, and their revolutions are corrected, and they call the</p>
<p>same and the other by their right names, and make the possessor of</p>
<p>them to become a rational being. And if these combine in him with</p>
<p>any true nurture or education, he attains the fulness and health of</p>
<p>the perfect man, and escapes the worst disease of all; but if he</p>
<p>neglects education he walks lame to the end of his life, and returns</p>
<p>imperfect and good for nothing to the world below. This, however, is a</p>
<p>later stage; at present we must treat more exactly the subject</p>
<p>before us, which involves a preliminary enquiry into the generation of</p>
<p>the body and its members, and as to how the soul was created-for</p>
<p>what reason and by what providence of the gods; and holding fast to</p>
<p>probability, we must pursue our way.</p>
<p>First, then, the gods, imitating the spherical shape of the</p>
<p>universe, enclosed the two divine courses in a spherical body, that,</p>
<p>namely, which we now term the head, being the most divine part of us</p>
<p>and the lord of all that is in us: to this the gods, when they put</p>
<p>together the body, gave all the other members to be servants,</p>
<p>considering that it partook of every sort of motion. In order then</p>
<p>that it might not tumble about among the high and deep places of the</p>
<p>earth, but might be able to get over the one and out of the other,</p>
<p>they provided the body to be its vehicle and means of locomotion;</p>
<p>which consequently had length and was furnished with four limbs</p>
<p>extended and flexible; these God contrived to be instruments of</p>
<p>locomotion with which it might take hold and find support, and so be</p>
<p>able to pass through all places, carrying on high the dwelling-place</p>
<p>of the most sacred and divine part of us. Such was the origin of</p>
<p>legs and hands, which for this reason were attached to every man;</p>
<p>and the gods, deeming the front part of man to be more honourable</p>
<p>and more fit to command than the hinder part, made us to move mostly</p>
<p>in a forward direction. Wherefore man must needs have his front part</p>
<p>unlike and distinguished from the rest of his body.</p>
<p>And so in the vessel of the head, they first of all put a face in</p>
<p>which they inserted organs to minister in all things to the providence</p>
<p>of the soul, and they appointed this part, which has authority, to</p>
<p>be by nature the part which is in front. And of the organs they</p>
<p>first contrived the eyes to give light, and the principle according to</p>
<p>which they were inserted was as follows: So much of fire as would</p>
<p>not burn, but gave a gentle light, they formed into a substance akin</p>
<p>to the light of every-day life; and the pure fire which is within us</p>
<p>and related thereto they made to flow through the eyes in a stream</p>
<p>smooth and dense, compressing the whole eye, and especially the centre</p>
<p>part, so that it kept out everything of a coarser nature, and</p>
<p>allowed to pass only this pure element. When the light of day</p>
<p>surrounds the stream of vision, then like falls upon like, and they</p>
<p>coalesce, and one body is formed by natural affinity in the line of</p>
<p>vision, wherever the light that falls from within meets with an</p>
<p>external object. And the whole stream of vision, being similarly</p>
<p>affected in virtue of similarity, diffuses the motions of what it</p>
<p>touches or what touches it over the whole body, until they reach the</p>
<p>soul, causing that perception which we call sight. But when night</p>
<p>comes on and the external and kindred fire departs, then the stream of</p>
<p>vision is cut off; for going forth to an unlike element it is</p>
<p>changed and extinguished, being no longer of one nature with the</p>
<p>surrounding atmosphere which is now deprived of fire: and so the eye</p>
<p>no longer sees, and we feel disposed to sleep. For when the eyelids,</p>
<p>which the gods invented for the preservation of sight, are closed,</p>
<p>they keep in the internal fire; and the power of the fire diffuses and</p>
<p>equalises the inward motions; when they are equalised, there is</p>
<p>rest, and when the rest is profound, sleep comes over us scarce</p>
<p>disturbed by dreams; but where the greater motions still remain, of</p>
<p>whatever nature and in whatever locality, they engender</p>
<p>corresponding visions in dreams, which are remembered by us when we</p>
<p>are awake and in the external world. And now there is no longer any</p>
<p>difficulty in understanding the creation of images in mirrors and</p>
<p>all smooth and bright surfaces. For from the communion of the internal</p>
<p>and external fires, and again from the union of them and their</p>
<p>numerous transformations when they meet in the mirror, all these</p>
<p>appearances of necessity arise, when the fire from the face</p>
<p>coalesces with the fire from the eye on the bright and smooth surface.</p>
<p>And right appears left and left right, because the visual rays come</p>
<p>into contact with the rays emitted by the object in a manner</p>
<p>contrary to the usual mode of meeting; but the right appears right,</p>
<p>and the left left, when the position of one of the two concurring</p>
<p>lights is reversed; and this happens when the mirror is concave and</p>
<p>its smooth surface repels the right stream of vision to the left side,</p>
<p>and the left to the right. Or if the mirror be turned vertically, then</p>
<p>the concavity makes the countenance appear to be all upside down,</p>
<p>and the lower rays are driven upwards and the upper downwards.</p>
<p>All these are to be reckoned among the second and co-operative</p>
<p>causes which God, carrying into execution the idea of the best as</p>
<p>far as possible, uses as his ministers. They are thought by most men</p>
<p>not to be the second, but the prime causes of all things, because they</p>
<p>freeze and heat, and contract and dilate, and the like. But they are</p>
<p>not so, for they are incapable of reason or intellect; the only</p>
<p>being which can properly have mind is the invisible soul, whereas fire</p>
<p>and water, and earth and air, are all of them visible bodies. The</p>
<p>lover of intellect and knowledge ought to explore causes of</p>
<p>intelligent nature first of all, and, secondly, of those things which,</p>
<p>being moved by others, are compelled to move others. And this is</p>
<p>what we too must do. Both kinds of causes should be acknowledged by</p>
<p>us, but a distinction should be made between those which are endowed</p>
<p>with mind and are the workers of things fair and good, and those which</p>
<p>are deprived of intelligence and always produce chance effects without</p>
<p>order or design. Of the second or co-operative causes of sight,</p>
<p>which help to give to the eyes the power which they now possess,</p>
<p>enough has been said. I will therefore now proceed to speak of the</p>
<p>higher use and purpose for which God has given them to us. The sight</p>
<p>in my opinion is the source of the greatest benefit to us, for had</p>
<p>we never seen the stars, and the sun, and the heaven, none of the</p>
<p>words which we have spoken about the universe would ever have been</p>
<p>uttered. But now the sight of day and night, and the months and the</p>
<p>revolutions of the years, have created number, and have given us a</p>
<p>conception of time, and the power of enquiring about the nature of the</p>
<p>universe; and from this source we have derived philosophy, than</p>
<p>which no greater good ever was or will be given by the gods to</p>
<p>mortal man. This is the greatest boon of sight: and of the lesser</p>
<p>benefits why should I speak? even the ordinary man if he were deprived</p>
<p>of them would bewail his loss, but in vain. Thus much let me say</p>
<p>however: God invented and gave us sight to the end that we might</p>
<p>behold the courses of intelligence in the heaven, and apply them to</p>
<p>the courses of our own intelligence which are akin to them, the</p>
<p>unperturbed to the perturbed; and that we, learning them and partaking</p>
<p>of the natural truth of reason, might imitate the absolutely</p>
<p>unerring courses of God and regulate our own vagaries. The same may be</p>
<p>affirmed of speech and hearing: they have been given by the gods to</p>
<p>the same end and for a like reason. For this is the principal end of</p>
<p>speech, whereto it most contributes. Moreover, so much of music as</p>
<p>is adapted to the sound of the voice and to the sense of hearing is</p>
<p>granted to us for the sake of harmony; and harmony, which has</p>
<p>motions akin to the revolutions of our souls, is not regarded by the</p>
<p>intelligent votary of the Muses as given by them with a view to</p>
<p>irrational pleasure, which is deemed to be the purpose of it in our</p>
<p>day, but as meant to correct any discord which may have arisen in</p>
<p>the courses of the soul, and to be our ally in bringing her into</p>
<p>harmony and agreement with herself; and rhythm too was given by them</p>
<p>for the same reason, on account of the irregular and graceless ways</p>
<p>which prevail among mankind generally, and to help us against them.</p>
<p>Thus far in what we have been saying, with small exception, the</p>
<p>works of intelligence have been set forth; and now we must place by</p>
<p>the side of them in our discourse the things which come into being</p>
<p>through necessity-for the creation is mixed, being made up of</p>
<p>necessity and mind. Mind, the ruling power, persuaded necessity to</p>
<p>bring the greater part of created things to perfection, and thus and</p>
<p>after this manner in the beginning, when the influence of reason got</p>
<p>the better of necessity, the universe was created. But if a person</p>
<p>will truly tell of the way in which the work was accomplished, he must</p>
<p>include the other influence of the variable cause as well.</p>
<p>Wherefore, we must return again and find another suitable beginning,</p>
<p>as about the former matters, so also about these. To which end we must</p>
<p>consider the nature of fire, and water, and air, and earth, such as</p>
<p>they were prior to the creation of the heaven, and what was</p>
<p>happening to them in this previous state; for no one has as yet</p>
<p>explained the manner of their generation, but we speak of fire and the</p>
<p>rest of them, whatever they mean, as though men knew their natures,</p>
<p>and we maintain them to be the first principles and letters or</p>
<p>elements of the whole, when they cannot reasonably be compared by a</p>
<p>man of any sense even to syllables or first compounds. And let me</p>
<p>say thus much: I will not now speak of the first principle or</p>
<p>principles of all things, or by whatever name they are to be called,</p>
<p>for this reason-because it is difficult to set forth my opinion</p>
<p>according to the method of discussion which we are at present</p>
<p>employing. Do not imagine, any more than I can bring myself to</p>
<p>imagine, that I should be right in undertaking so great and</p>
<p>difficult a task. Remembering what I said at first about</p>
<p>probability, I will do my best to give as probable an explanation as</p>
<p>any other-or rather, more probable; and I will first go back to the</p>
<p>beginning and try to speak of each thing and of all. Once more,</p>
<p>then, at the commencement of my discourse, I call upon God, and beg</p>
<p>him to be our saviour out of a strange and unwonted enquiry, and to</p>
<p>bring us to the haven of probability. So now let us begin again.</p>
<p>This new beginning of our discussion of the universe requires a</p>
<p>fuller division than the former; for then we made two classes, now a</p>
<p>third must be revealed. The two sufficed for the former discussion:</p>
<p>one, which we assumed, was a pattern intelligible and always the same;</p>
<p>and the second was only the imitation of the pattern, generated and</p>
<p>visible. There is also a third kind which we did not distinguish at</p>
<p>the time, conceiving that the two would be enough. But now the</p>
<p>argument seems to require that we should set forth in words another</p>
<p>kind, which is difficult of explanation and dimly seen. What nature</p>
<p>are we to attribute to this new kind of being? We reply, that it is</p>
<p>the receptacle, and in a manner the nurse, of all generation. I have</p>
<p>spoken the truth; but I must express myself in clearer language, and</p>
<p>this will be an arduous task for many reasons, and in particular</p>
<p>because I must first raise questions concerning fire and the other</p>
<p>elements, and determine what each of them is; for to say, with any</p>
<p>probability or certitude, which of them should be called water</p>
<p>rather than fire, and which should be called any of them rather than</p>
<p>all or some one of them, is a difficult matter. How, then, shall we</p>
<p>settle this point, and what questions about the elements may be fairly</p>
<p>raised?</p>
<p>In the first place, we see that what we just now called water, by</p>
<p>condensation, I suppose, becomes stone and earth; and this same</p>
<p>element, when melted and dispersed, passes into vapour and air. Air,</p>
<p>again, when inflamed, becomes fire; and again fire, when condensed and</p>
<p>extinguished, passes once more into the form of air; and once more,</p>
<p>air, when collected and condensed, produces cloud and mist; and from</p>
<p>these, when still more compressed, comes flowing water, and from water</p>
<p>comes earth and stones once more; and thus generation appears to be</p>
<p>transmitted from one to the other in a circle. Thus, then, as the</p>
<p>several elements never present themselves in the same form, how can</p>
<p>any one have the assurance to assert positively that any of them,</p>
<p>whatever it may be, is one thing rather than another? No one can.</p>
<p>But much the safest plan is to speak of them as follows:-Anything</p>
<p>which we see to be continually changing, as, for example, fire, we</p>
<p>must not call &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that,&quot; but rather say that it is &quot;of such a</p>
<p>nature&quot;; nor let us speak of water as &quot;this&quot;; but always as &quot;such&quot;;</p>
<p>nor must we imply that there is any stability in any of those things</p>
<p>which we indicate by the use of the words &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that,&quot; supposing</p>
<p>ourselves to signify something thereby; for they are too volatile to</p>
<p>be detained in any such expressions as &quot;this,&quot; or &quot;that,&quot; or &quot;relative</p>
<p>to this,&quot; or any other mode of speaking which represents them as</p>
<p>permanent. We ought not to apply &quot;this&quot; to any of them, but rather the</p>
<p>word &quot;such&quot;; which expresses the similar principle circulating in each</p>
<p>and all of them; for example, that should be called &quot;fire&quot; which is of</p>
<p>such a nature always, and so of everything that has generation. That</p>
<p>in which the elements severally grow up, and appear, and decay, is</p>
<p>alone to be called by the name &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot;; but that which is</p>
<p>of a certain nature, hot or white, or anything which admits of</p>
<p>opposite equalities, and all things that are compounded of them, ought</p>
<p>not to be so denominated. Let me make another attempt to explain my</p>
<p>meaning more clearly. Suppose a person to make all kinds of figures of</p>
<p>gold and to be always transmuting one form into all the</p>
<p>rest-somebody points to one of them and asks what it is. By far the</p>
<p>safest and truest answer is, That is gold; and not to call the</p>
<p>triangle or any other figures which are formed in the gold &quot;these,&quot; as</p>
<p>though they had existence, since they are in process of change while</p>
<p>he is making the assertion; but if the questioner be willing to take</p>
<p>the safe and indefinite expression, &quot;such,&quot; we should be satisfied.</p>
<p>And the same argument applies to the universal nature which receives</p>
<p>all bodies-that must be always called the same; for, while receiving</p>
<p>all things, she never departs at all from her own nature, and never in</p>
<p>any way, or at any time, assumes a form like that of any of the things</p>
<p>which enter into her; she is the natural recipient of all impressions,</p>
<p>and is stirred and informed by them, and appears different from time</p>
<p>to time by reason of them. But the forms which enter into and go out</p>
<p>of her are the likenesses of real existences modelled after their</p>
<p>patterns in wonderful and inexplicable manner, which we will hereafter</p>
<p>investigate. For the present we have only to conceive of three</p>
<p>natures: first, that which is in process of generation; secondly, that</p>
<p>in which the generation takes place; and thirdly, that of which the</p>
<p>thing generated is a resemblance. And we may liken the receiving</p>
<p>principle to a mother, and the source or spring to a father, and the</p>
<p>intermediate nature to a child; and may remark further, that if the</p>
<p>model is to take every variety of form, then the matter in which the</p>
<p>model is fashioned will not be duly prepared, unless it is formless,</p>
<p>and free from the impress of any of these shapes which it is hereafter</p>
<p>to receive from without. For if the matter were like any of the</p>
<p>supervening forms, then whenever any opposite or entirely different</p>
<p>nature was stamped upon its surface, it would take the impression</p>
<p>badly, because it would intrude its own shape. Wherefore, that which</p>
<p>is to receive all forms should have no form; as in making perfumes</p>
<p>they first contrive that the liquid substance which is to receive</p>
<p>the scent shall be as inodorous as possible; or as those who wish to</p>
<p>impress figures on soft substances do not allow any previous</p>
<p>impression to remain, but begin by making the surface as even and</p>
<p>smooth as possible. In the same way that which is to receive</p>
<p>perpetually and through its whole extent the resemblances of all</p>
<p>eternal beings ought to be devoid of any particular form. Wherefore,</p>
<p>the mother and receptacle of all created and visible and in any way</p>
<p>sensible things, is not to be termed earth, or air, or fire, or water,</p>
<p>or any of their compounds or any of the elements from which these</p>
<p>are derived, but is an invisible and formless being which receives all</p>
<p>things and in some mysterious way partakes of the intelligible, and is</p>
<p>most incomprehensible. In saying this we shall not be far wrong; as</p>
<p>far, however, as we can attain to a knowledge of her from the previous</p>
<p>considerations, we may truly say that fire is that part of her</p>
<p>nature which from time to time is inflamed, and water that which is</p>
<p>moistened, and that the mother substance becomes earth and air, in</p>
<p>so far as she receives the impressions of them.</p>
<p>Let us consider this question more precisely. Is there any</p>
<p>self-existent fire? and do all those things which we call</p>
<p>self-existent exist? or are only those things which we see, or in some</p>
<p>way perceive through the bodily organs, truly existent, and nothing</p>
<p>whatever besides them? And is all that which, we call an</p>
<p>intelligible essence nothing at all, and only a name? Here is a</p>
<p>question which we must not leave unexamined or undetermined, nor</p>
<p>must we affirm too confidently that there can be no decision;</p>
<p>neither must we interpolate in our present long discourse a digression</p>
<p>equally long, but if it is possible to set forth a great principle</p>
<p>in a few words, that is just what we want.</p>
<p>Thus I state my view:-If mind and true opinion are two distinct</p>
<p>classes, then I say that there certainly are these self-existent ideas</p>
<p>unperceived by sense, and apprehended only by the mind; if, however,</p>
<p>as some say, true opinion differs in no respect from mind, then</p>
<p>everything that we perceive through the body is to be regarded as most</p>
<p>real and certain. But we must affirm that to be distinct, for they</p>
<p>have a distinct origin and are of a different nature; the one is</p>
<p>implanted in us by instruction, the other by persuasion; the one is</p>
<p>always accompanied by true reason, the other is without reason; the</p>
<p>one cannot be overcome by persuasion, but the other can: and lastly,</p>
<p>every man may be said to share in true opinion, but mind is the</p>
<p>attribute of the gods and of very few men. Wherefore also we must</p>
<p>acknowledge that there is one kind of being which is always the</p>
<p>same, uncreated and indestructible, never receiving anything into</p>
<p>itself from without, nor itself going out to any other, but</p>
<p>invisible and imperceptible by any sense, and of which the</p>
<p>contemplation is granted to intelligence only. And there is another</p>
<p>nature of the same name with it, and like to it, perceived by sense,</p>
<p>created, always in motion, becoming in place and again vanishing out</p>
<p>of place, which is apprehended by opinion and sense. And there is a</p>
<p>third nature, which is space, and is eternal, and admits not of</p>
<p>destruction and provides a home for all created things, and is</p>
<p>apprehended without the help of sense, by a kind of spurious reason,</p>
<p>and is hardly real; which we beholding as in a dream, say of all</p>
<p>existence that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy a</p>
<p>space, but that what is neither in heaven nor in earth has no</p>
<p>existence. Of these and other things of the same kind, relating to the</p>
<p>true and waking reality of nature, we have only this dreamlike</p>
<p>sense, and we are unable to cast off sleep and determine the truth</p>
<p>about them. For an image, since the reality, after which it is</p>
<p>modelled, does not belong to it, and it exists ever as the fleeting</p>
<p>shadow of some other, must be inferred to be in another [i.e. in space</p>
<p>], grasping existence in some way or other, or it could not be at all.</p>
<p>But true and exact reason, vindicating the nature of true being,</p>
<p>maintains that while two things [i.e. the image and space] are</p>
<p>different they cannot exist one of them in the other and so be one and</p>
<p>also two at the same time.</p>
<p>Thus have I concisely given the result of my thoughts; and my</p>
<p>verdict is that being and space and generation, these three, existed</p>
<p>in their three ways before the heaven; and that the nurse of</p>
<p>generation, moistened by water and inflamed by fire, and receiving the</p>
<p>forms of earth and air, and experiencing all the affections which</p>
<p>accompany these, presented a strange variety of appearances; and being</p>
<p>full of powers which were neither similar nor equally balanced, was</p>
<p>never in any part in a state of equipoise, but swaying unevenly hither</p>
<p>and thither, was shaken by them, and by its motion again shook them;</p>
<p>and the elements when moved were separated and carried continually,</p>
<p>some one way, some another; as, when rain is shaken and winnowed by</p>
<p>fans and other instruments used in the threshing of corn, the close</p>
<p>and heavy particles are borne away and settle in one direction, and</p>
<p>the loose and light particles in another. In this manner, the four</p>
<p>kinds or elements were then shaken by the receiving vessel, which,</p>
<p>moving like a winnowing machine, scattered far away from one another</p>
<p>the elements most unlike, and forced the most similar elements into</p>
<p>dose contact. Wherefore also the various elements had different places</p>
<p>before they were arranged so as to form the universe. At first, they</p>
<p>were all without reason and measure. But when the world began to get</p>
<p>into order, fire and water and earth and air had only certain faint</p>
<p>traces of themselves, and were altogether such as everything might</p>
<p>be expected to be in the absence of God; this, I say, was their nature</p>
<p>at that time, and God fashioned them by form and number. Let it be</p>
<p>consistently maintained by us in all that we say that God made them as</p>
<p>far as possible the fairest and best, out of things which were not</p>
<p>fair and good. And now I will endeavour to show you the disposition</p>
<p>and generation of them by an unaccustomed argument, which am compelled</p>
<p>to use; but I believe that you will be able to follow me, for your</p>
<p>education has made you familiar with the methods of science.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, as is evident to all, fire and earth and</p>
<p>water and air are bodies. And every sort of body possesses solidity,</p>
<p>and every solid must necessarily be contained in planes; and every</p>
<p>plane rectilinear figure is composed of triangles; and all triangles</p>
<p>are originally of two kinds, both of which are made up of one right</p>
<p>and two acute angles; one of them has at either end of the base the</p>
<p>half of a divided right angle, having equal sides, while in the</p>
<p>other the right angle is divided into unequal parts, having unequal</p>
<p>sides. These, then, proceeding by a combination of probability with</p>
<p>demonstration, we assume to be the original elements of fire and the</p>
<p>other bodies; but the principles which are prior to these God only</p>
<p>knows, and he of men who is the friend God. And next we have to</p>
<p>determine what are the four most beautiful bodies which are unlike one</p>
<p>another, and of which some are capable of resolution into one another;</p>
<p>for having discovered thus much, we shall know the true origin of</p>
<p>earth and fire and of the proportionate and intermediate elements. And</p>
<p>then we shall not be willing to allow that there are any distinct</p>
<p>kinds of visible bodies fairer than these. Wherefore we must endeavour</p>
<p>to construct the four forms of bodies which excel in beauty, and</p>
<p>then we shall be able to say that we have sufficiently apprehended</p>
<p>their nature. Now of the two triangles, the isosceles has one form</p>
<p>only; the scalene or unequal-sided has an infinite number. Of the</p>
<p>infinite forms we must select the most beautiful, if we are to proceed</p>
<p>in due order, and any one who can point out a more beautiful form than</p>
<p>ours for the construction of these bodies, shall carry off the palm,</p>
<p>not as an enemy, but as a friend. Now, the one which we maintain to be</p>
<p>the most beautiful of all the many triangles (and we need not speak of</p>
<p>the others) is that of which the double forms a third triangle which</p>
<p>is equilateral; the reason of this would be long to tell; he who</p>
<p>disproves what we are saying, and shows that we are mistaken, may</p>
<p>claim a friendly victory. Then let us choose two triangles, out of</p>
<p>which fire and the other elements have been constructed, one</p>
<p>isosceles, the other having the square of the longer side equal to</p>
<p>three times the square of the lesser side.</p>
<p>Now is the time to explain what was before obscurely said: there was</p>
<p>an error in imagining that all the four elements might be generated by</p>
<p>and into one another; this, I say, was an erroneous supposition, for</p>
<p>there are generated from the triangles which we have selected four</p>
<p>kinds-three from the one which has the sides unequal; the fourth alone</p>
<p>is framed out of the isosceles triangle. Hence they cannot all be</p>
<p>resolved into one another, a great number of small bodies being</p>
<p>combined into a few large ones, or the converse. But three of them can</p>
<p>be thus resolved and compounded, for they all spring from one, and</p>
<p>when the greater bodies are broken up, many small bodies will spring</p>
<p>up out of them and take their own proper figures; or, again, when many</p>
<p>small bodies are dissolved into their triangles, if they become one,</p>
<p>they will form one large mass of another kind. So much for their</p>
<p>passage into one another. I have now to speak of their several</p>
<p>kinds, and show out of what combinations of numbers each of them was</p>
<p>formed. The first will be the simplest and smallest construction,</p>
<p>and its element is that triangle which has its hypotenuse twice the</p>
<p>lesser side. When two such triangles are joined at the diagonal, and</p>
<p>this is repeated three times, and the triangles rest their diagonals</p>
<p>and shorter sides on the same point as a centre, a single</p>
<p>equilateral triangle is formed out of six triangles; and four</p>
<p>equilateral triangles, if put together, make out of every three</p>
<p>plane angles one solid angle, being that which is nearest to the</p>
<p>most obtuse of plane angles; and out of the combination of these</p>
<p>four angles arises the first solid form which distributes into equal</p>
<p>and similar parts the whole circle in which it is inscribed. The</p>
<p>second species of solid is formed out of the same triangles, which</p>
<p>unite as eight equilateral triangles and form one solid angle out of</p>
<p>four plane angles, and out of six such angles the second body is</p>
<p>completed. And the third body is made up of 120 triangular elements,</p>
<p>forming twelve solid angles, each of them included in five plane</p>
<p>equilateral triangles, having altogether twenty bases, each of which</p>
<p>is an equilateral triangle. The one element [that is, the triangle</p>
<p>which has its hypotenuse twice the lesser side] having generated these</p>
<p>figures, generated no more; but the isosceles triangle produced the</p>
<p>fourth elementary figure, which is compounded of four such</p>
<p>triangles, joining their right angles in a centre, and forming one</p>
<p>equilateral quadrangle. Six of these united form eight solid angles,</p>
<p>each of which is made by the combination of three plane right</p>
<p>angles; the figure of the body thus composed is a cube, having six</p>
<p>plane quadrangular equilateral bases. There was yet a fifth</p>
<p>combination which God used in the delineation of the universe.</p>
<p>Now, he who, duly reflecting on all this, enquires whether the</p>
<p>worlds are to be regarded as indefinite or definite in number, will be</p>
<p>of opinion that the notion of their indefiniteness is characteristic</p>
<p>of a sadly indefinite and ignorant mind. He, however, who raises the</p>
<p>question whether they are to be truly regarded as one or five, takes</p>
<p>up a more reasonable position. Arguing from probabilities, I am of</p>
<p>opinion that they are one; another, regarding the question from</p>
<p>another point of view, will be of another mind. But, leaving this</p>
<p>enquiry, let us proceed to distribute the elementary forms, which have</p>
<p>now been created in idea, among the four elements.</p>
<p>To earth, then, let us assign the cubical form; for earth is the</p>
<p>most immoveable of the four and the most plastic of all bodies, and</p>
<p>that which has the most stable bases must of necessity be of such a</p>
<p>nature. Now, of the triangles which we assumed at first, that which</p>
<p>has two equal sides is by nature more firmly based than that which has</p>
<p>unequal sides; and of the compound figures which are formed out of</p>
<p>either, the plane equilateral quadrangle has necessarily, a more</p>
<p>stable basis than the equilateral triangle, both in the whole and in</p>
<p>the parts. Wherefore, in assigning this figure to earth, we adhere</p>
<p>to probability; and to water we assign that one of the remaining forms</p>
<p>which is the least moveable; and the most moveable of them to fire;</p>
<p>and to air that which is intermediate. Also we assign the smallest</p>
<p>body to fire, and the greatest to water, and the intermediate in</p>
<p>size to air; and, again, the acutest body to fire, and the next in</p>
<p>acuteness to, air, and the third to water. Of all these elements, that</p>
<p>which has the fewest bases must necessarily be the most moveable,</p>
<p>for it must be the acutest and most penetrating in every way, and also</p>
<p>the lightest as being composed of the smallest number of similar</p>
<p>particles: and the second body has similar properties in a second</p>
<p>degree, and the third body in the third degree. Let it be agreed,</p>
<p>then, both according to strict reason and according to probability,</p>
<p>that the pyramid is the solid which is the original element and seed</p>
<p>of fire; and let us assign the element which was next in the order</p>
<p>of generation to air, and the third to water. We must imagine all</p>
<p>these to be so small that no single particle of any of the four</p>
<p>kinds is seen by us on account of their smallness: but when many of</p>
<p>them are collected together their aggregates are seen. And the</p>
<p>ratios of their numbers, motions, and other properties, everywhere</p>
<p>God, as far as necessity allowed or gave consent, has exactly</p>
<p>perfected, and harmonised in due proportion.</p>
<p>From all that we have just been saying about the elements or</p>
<p>kinds, the most probable conclusion is as follows:-earth, when meeting</p>
<p>with fire and dissolved by its sharpness, whether the dissolution take</p>
<p>place in the fire itself or perhaps in some mass of air or water, is</p>
<p>borne hither and thither, until its parts, meeting together and</p>
<p>mutually harmonising, again become earth; for they can never take</p>
<p>any other form. But water, when divided by fire or by air, on</p>
<p>reforming, may become one part fire and two parts air; and a single</p>
<p>volume of air divided becomes two of fire. Again, when a small body of</p>
<p>fire is contained in a larger body of air or water or earth, and</p>
<p>both are moving, and the fire struggling is overcome and broken up,</p>
<p>then two volumes of fire form one volume of air; and when air is</p>
<p>overcome and cut up into small pieces, two and a half parts of air are</p>
<p>condensed into one part of water. Let us consider the matter in</p>
<p>another way. When one of the other elements is fastened upon by</p>
<p>fire, and is cut by the sharpness of its angles and sides, it</p>
<p>coalesces with the fire, and then ceases to be cut by them any longer.</p>
<p>For no element which is one and the same with itself can be changed by</p>
<p>or change another of the same kind and in the same state. But so</p>
<p>long as in the process of transition the weaker is fighting against</p>
<p>the stronger, the dissolution continues. Again, when a few small</p>
<p>particles, enclosed in many larger ones, are in process of</p>
<p>decomposition and extinction, they only cease from their tendency to</p>
<p>extinction when they consent to pass into the conquering nature, and</p>
<p>fire becomes air and air water. But if bodies of another kind go and</p>
<p>attack them [i.e. the small particles], the latter continue to be</p>
<p>dissolved until, being completely forced back and dispersed, they make</p>
<p>their escape to their own kindred, or else, being overcome and</p>
<p>assimilated to the conquering power, they remain where they are and</p>
<p>dwell with their victors, and from being many become one. And owing to</p>
<p>these affections, all things are changing their place, for by the</p>
<p>motion of the receiving vessel the bulk of each class is distributed</p>
<p>into its proper place; but those things which become unlike themselves</p>
<p>and like other things, are hurried by the shaking into the place of</p>
<p>the things to which they grow like.</p>
<p>Now all unmixed and primary bodies are produced by such causes as</p>
<p>these. As to the subordinate species which are included in the greater</p>
<p>kinds, they are to be attributed to the varieties in the structure</p>
<p>of the two original triangles. For either structure did not originally</p>
<p>produce the triangle of one size only, but some larger and some</p>
<p>smaller, and there are as many sizes as there are species of the</p>
<p>four elements. Hence when they are mingled with themselves and with</p>
<p>one another there is an endless variety of them, which those who would</p>
<p>arrive at the probable truth of nature ought duly to consider.</p>
<p>Unless a person comes to an understanding about the nature and</p>
<p>conditions of rest and motion, he will meet with many difficulties</p>
<p>in the discussion which follows. Something has been said of this</p>
<p>matter already, and something more remains to be said, which is,</p>
<p>that motion never exists in what is uniform. For to conceive that</p>
<p>anything can be moved without a mover is hard or indeed impossible,</p>
<p>and equally impossible to conceive that there can be a mover unless</p>
<p>there be something which can be moved-motion cannot exist where either</p>
<p>of these are wanting, and for these to be uniform is impossible;</p>
<p>wherefore we must assign rest to uniformity and motion to the want</p>
<p>of uniformity. Now inequality is the cause of the nature which is</p>
<p>wanting in uniformity; and of this we have already described the</p>
<p>origin. But there still remains the further point-why things when</p>
<p>divided after their kinds do not cease to pass through one another and</p>
<p>to change their place-which we will now proceed to explain. In the</p>
<p>revolution of the universe are comprehended all the four elements, and</p>
<p>this being circular and having a tendency to come together, compresses</p>
<p>everything and will not allow any place to be left void. Wherefore,</p>
<p>also, fire above all things penetrates everywhere, and air next, as</p>
<p>being next in rarity of the elements; and the two other elements in</p>
<p>like manner penetrate according to their degrees of rarity. For</p>
<p>those things which are composed of the largest particles have the</p>
<p>largest void left in their compositions, and those which are</p>
<p>composed of the smallest particles have the least. And the contraction</p>
<p>caused by the compression thrusts the smaller particles into the</p>
<p>interstices of the larger. And thus, when the small parts are placed</p>
<p>side by side with the larger, and the lesser divide the greater and</p>
<p>the greater unite the lesser, all the elements are borne up and down</p>
<p>and hither and thither towards their own places; for the change in the</p>
<p>size of each changes its position in space. And these causes</p>
<p>generate an inequality which is always maintained, and is</p>
<p>continually creating a perpetual motion of the elements in all time.</p>
<p>In the next place we have to consider that there are divers kinds of</p>
<p>fire. There are, for example, first, flame; and secondly, those</p>
<p>emanations of flame which do not burn but only give light to the eyes;</p>
<p>thirdly, the remains of fire, which are seen in red-hot embers after</p>
<p>the flame has been extinguished. There are similar differences in</p>
<p>the air; of which the brightest part is called the aether, and the</p>
<p>most turbid sort mist and darkness; and there are various other</p>
<p>nameless kinds which arise from the inequality of the triangles.</p>
<p>Water, again, admits in the first place of a division into two</p>
<p>kinds; the one liquid and the other fusile. The liquid kind is</p>
<p>composed of the small and unequal particles of water; and moves itself</p>
<p>and is moved by other bodies owing to the want of uniformity and the</p>
<p>shape of its particles; whereas the fusile kind, being formed of large</p>
<p>and uniform particles, is more stable than the other, and is heavy and</p>
<p>compact by reason of its uniformity. But when fire gets in and</p>
<p>dissolves the particles and destroys the uniformity, it has greater</p>
<p>mobility, and becoming fluid is thrust forth by the neighbouring air</p>
<p>and spreads upon the earth; and this dissolution of the solid masses</p>
<p>is called melting, and their spreading out upon the earth flowing.</p>
<p>Again, when the fire goes out of the fusile substance, it does not</p>
<p>pass into vacuum, but into the neighbouring air; and the air which</p>
<p>is displaced forces together the liquid and still moveable mass into</p>
<p>the place which was occupied by the fire, and unites it with itself.</p>
<p>Thus compressed the mass resumes its equability, and is again at unity</p>
<p>with itself, because the fire which was the author of the inequality</p>
<p>has retreated; and this departure of the fire is called cooling, and</p>
<p>the coming together which follows upon it is termed congealment. Of</p>
<p>all the kinds termed fusile, that which is the densest and is formed</p>
<p>out of the finest and most uniform parts is that most precious</p>
<p>possession called gold, which is hardened by filtration through</p>
<p>rock; this is unique in kind, and has both a glittering and a yellow</p>
<p>colour. A shoot of gold, which is so dense as to be very hard, and</p>
<p>takes a black colour, is termed adamant. There is also another kind</p>
<p>which has parts nearly like gold, and of which there are several</p>
<p>species; it is denser than gold, and it contains a small and fine</p>
<p>portion of earth, and is therefore harder, yet also lighter because of</p>
<p>the great interstices which it has within itself; and this</p>
<p>substance, which is one of the bright and denser kinds of water,</p>
<p>when solidified is called copper. There is an alloy of earth mingled</p>
<p>with it, which, when the two parts grow old and are disunited, shows</p>
<p>itself separately and is called rust. The remaining phenomena of the</p>
<p>same kind there will be no difficulty in reasoning out by the method</p>
<p>of probabilities. A man may sometimes set aside meditations about</p>
<p>eternal things, and for recreation turn to consider the truths of</p>
<p>generation which are probable only; he will thus gain a pleasure not</p>
<p>to be repented of, and secure for himself while he lives a wise and</p>
<p>moderate pastime. Let us grant ourselves this indulgence, and go</p>
<p>through the probabilities relating to the same subjects which follow</p>
<p>next in order.</p>
<p>Water which is mingled with fire, so much as is fine and liquid</p>
<p>(being so called by reason of its motion and the way in which it rolls</p>
<p>along the ground), and soft, because its bases give way are less</p>
<p>stable than those of earth, when separated from fire and air and</p>
<p>isolated, becomes more uniform, and by their retirement is</p>
<p>compressed into itself; and if the condensation be very great, the</p>
<p>water above the earth becomes hail, but on the earth, ice; and that</p>
<p>which is congealed in a less degree and is only half solid, when above</p>
<p>the earth is called snow, and when upon the earth, and condensed</p>
<p>from dew, hoarfrost. Then, again, there are the numerous kinds of</p>
<p>water which have been mingled with one another, and are distilled</p>
<p>through plants which grow in the earth; and this whole class is called</p>
<p>by the name of juices or saps. The unequal admixture of these fluids</p>
<p>creates a variety of species; most of them are nameless, but four</p>
<p>which are of a fiery nature are clearly distinguished and have</p>
<p>names. First there is wine, which warms the soul as well as the</p>
<p>body: secondly, there is the oily nature, which is smooth and</p>
<p>divides the visual ray, and for this reason is bright and shining</p>
<p>and of a glistening appearance, including pitch, the juice of the</p>
<p>castor berry, oil itself, and other things of a like kind: thirdly,</p>
<p>there is the class of substances which expand the contracted parts</p>
<p>of the mouth, until they return to their natural state, and by</p>
<p>reason of this property create sweetness;-these are included under the</p>
<p>general name of honey: and, lastly, there is a frothy nature, which</p>
<p>differs from all juices, having a burning quality which dissolves</p>
<p>the flesh; it is called opos (a vegetable acid).</p>
<p>As to the kinds of earth, that which is filtered through water</p>
<p>passes into stone in the following manner:-The water which mixes</p>
<p>with the earth and is broken up in the process changes into air, and</p>
<p>taking this form mounts into its own place. But as there is no</p>
<p>surrounding vacuum it thrusts away the neighbouring air, and this</p>
<p>being rendered heavy, and, when it is displaced, having been poured</p>
<p>around the mass of earth, forcibly compresses it and drives it into</p>
<p>the vacant space whence the new air had come up; and the earth when</p>
<p>compressed by the air into an indissoluble union with water becomes</p>
<p>rock. The fairer sort is that which is made up of equal and similar</p>
<p>parts and is transparent; that which has the opposite qualities is</p>
<p>inferior. But when all the watery part is suddenly drawn out by</p>
<p>fire, a more brittle substance is formed, to which we give the name of</p>
<p>pottery. Sometimes also moisture may remain, and the earth which has</p>
<p>been fused by fire becomes, when cool, a certain stone of a black</p>
<p>colour. A like separation of the water which had been copiously</p>
<p>mingled with them may occur in two substances composed of finer</p>
<p>particles of earth and of a briny nature; out of either of them a half</p>
<p>solid body is then formed, soluble in water-the one, soda, which is</p>
<p>used for purging away oil and earth, and other, salt, which harmonizes</p>
<p>so well in combinations pleasing to the palate, and is, as the law</p>
<p>testifies, a substance dear to the gods. The compounds of earth and</p>
<p>water are not soluble by water, but by fire only, and for this</p>
<p>reason:-Neither fire nor air melt masses of earth; for their</p>
<p>particles, being smaller than the interstices in its structure, have</p>
<p>plenty of room to move without forcing their way, and so they leave</p>
<p>the earth unmelted and undissolved; but particles of water, which</p>
<p>are larger, force a passage, and dissolve and melt the earth.</p>
<p>Wherefore earth when not consolidated by force is dissolved by water</p>
<p>only; when consolidated, by nothing but fire; for this is the only</p>
<p>body which can find an entrance. The cohesion of water again, when</p>
<p>very strong, is dissolved by fire only-when weaker, then either by air</p>
<p>or fire-the former entering the interstices, and the latter</p>
<p>penetrating even the triangles. But nothing can dissolve air, when</p>
<p>strongly condensed, which does not reach the elements or triangles; or</p>
<p>if not strongly condensed, then only fire can dissolve it. As to</p>
<p>bodies composed of earth and water, while the water occupies the</p>
<p>vacant interstices of the earth in them which are compressed by force,</p>
<p>the particles of water which approach them from without, finding no</p>
<p>entrance, flow around the entire mass and leave it undissolved; but</p>
<p>the particles of fire, entering into the interstices of the water,</p>
<p>do to the water what water does to earth and fire to air, and are</p>
<p>the sole causes of the compound body of earth and water liquefying and</p>
<p>becoming fluid. Now these bodies are of two kinds; some of them,</p>
<p>such as glass and the fusible sort of stones, have less water than</p>
<p>they have earth; on the other hand, substances of the nature of wax</p>
<p>and incense have more of water entering into their composition.</p>
<p>I have thus shown the various classes of bodies as they are</p>
<p>diversified by their forms and combinations and changes into one</p>
<p>another, and now I must endeavour to set forth their affections and</p>
<p>the causes of them. In the first place, the bodies which I have been</p>
<p>describing are necessarily objects of sense. But we have not yet</p>
<p>considered the origin of flesh, or what belongs to flesh, or of that</p>
<p>part of the soul which is mortal. And these things cannot be</p>
<p>adequately explained without also explaining the affections which</p>
<p>are concerned with sensation, nor the latter without the former: and</p>
<p>yet to explain them together is hardly possible; for which reason we</p>
<p>must assume first one or the other and afterwards examine the nature</p>
<p>of our hypothesis. In order, then, that the affections may follow</p>
<p>regularly after the elements, let us presuppose the existence of</p>
<p>body and soul.</p>
<p>First, let us enquire what we mean by saying that fire is hot; and</p>
<p>about this we may reason from the dividing or cutting power which it</p>
<p>exercises on our bodies. We all of us feel that fire is sharp; and</p>
<p>we may further consider the fineness of the sides, and the sharpness</p>
<p>of the angles, and the smallness of the particles, and the swiftness</p>
<p>of the motion-all this makes the action of fire violent and sharp,</p>
<p>so that it cuts whatever it meets. And we must not forget that the</p>
<p>original figure of fire [i.e. the pyramid], more than any other</p>
<p>form, has a dividing power which cuts our bodies into small pieces</p>
<p>(Kepmatizei), and thus naturally produces that affection which we call</p>
<p>heat; and hence the origin of the name (thepmos, Kepma). Now, the</p>
<p>opposite of this is sufficiently manifest; nevertheless we will not</p>
<p>fail to describe it. For the larger particles of moisture which</p>
<p>surround the body, entering in and driving out the lesser, but not</p>
<p>being able to take their places, compress the moist principle in us;</p>
<p>and this from being unequal and disturbed, is forced by them into a</p>
<p>state of rest, which is due to equability and compression. But</p>
<p>things which are contracted contrary to nature are by nature at war,</p>
<p>and force themselves apart; and to this war and convulsion the name of</p>
<p>shivering and trembling is given; and the whole affection and the</p>
<p>cause of the affection are both termed cold. That is called hard to</p>
<p>which our flesh yields, and soft which yields to our flesh; and things</p>
<p>are also termed hard and soft relatively to one another. That which</p>
<p>yields has a small base; but that which rests on quadrangular bases is</p>
<p>firmly posed and belongs to the class which offers the greatest</p>
<p>resistance; so too does that which is the most compact and therefore</p>
<p>most repellent. The nature of the light and the heavy will be best</p>
<p>understood when examined in connexion with our notions of above and</p>
<p>below; for it is quite a mistake to suppose that the universe is</p>
<p>parted into two regions, separate from and opposite to each other, the</p>
<p>one a lower to which all things tend which have any bulk, and an upper</p>
<p>to which things only ascend against their will. For as the universe is</p>
<p>in the form of a sphere, all the extremities, being equidistant from</p>
<p>the centre, are equally extremities, and the centre, which is</p>
<p>equidistant from them, is equally to be regarded as the opposite of</p>
<p>them all. Such being the nature of the world, when a person says</p>
<p>that any of these points is above or below, may he not be justly</p>
<p>charged with using an improper expression? For the centre of the world</p>
<p>cannot be rightly called either above or below, but is the centre</p>
<p>and nothing else; and the circumference is not the centre, and has</p>
<p>in no one part of itself a different relation to the centre from</p>
<p>what it has in any of the opposite parts. Indeed, when it is in</p>
<p>every direction similar, how can one rightly give to it names which</p>
<p>imply opposition? For if there were any solid body in equipoise at the</p>
<p>centre of the universe, there would be nothing to draw it to this</p>
<p>extreme rather than to that, for they are all perfectly similar; and</p>
<p>if a person were to go round the world in a circle, he would often,</p>
<p>when standing at the antipodes of his former position, speak of the</p>
<p>same point as above and below; for, as I was saying just now, to speak</p>
<p>of the whole which is in the form of a globe as having one part</p>
<p>above and another below is not like a sensible man.</p>
<p>The reason why these names are used, and the circumstances under</p>
<p>which they are ordinarily applied by us to the division of the</p>
<p>heavens, may be elucidated by the following supposition:-if a person</p>
<p>were to stand in that part of the universe which is the appointed</p>
<p>place of fire, and where there is the great mass of fire to which</p>
<p>fiery bodies gather-if, I say, he were to ascend thither, and,</p>
<p>having the power to do this, were to abstract particles of fire and</p>
<p>put them in scales and weigh them, and then, raising the balance, were</p>
<p>to draw the fire by force towards the uncongenial element of the</p>
<p>air, it would be very evident that he could compel the smaller mass</p>
<p>more readily than the larger; for when two things are simultaneously</p>
<p>raised by one and the same power, the smaller body must necessarily</p>
<p>yield to the superior power with less reluctance than the larger;</p>
<p>and the larger body is called heavy and said to tend downwards, and</p>
<p>the smaller body is called light and said to tend upwards. And we</p>
<p>may detect ourselves who are upon the earth doing precisely the same</p>
<p>thing. For we of separate earthy natures, and sometimes earth</p>
<p>itself, and draw them into the uncongenial element of air by force and</p>
<p>contrary to nature, both clinging to their kindred elements. But</p>
<p>that which is smaller yields to the impulse given by us towards the</p>
<p>dissimilar element more easily than the larger; and so we call the</p>
<p>former light, and the place towards which it is impelled we call</p>
<p>above, and the contrary state and place we call heavy and below</p>
<p>respectively. Now the relations of these must necessarily vary,</p>
<p>because the principal masses of the different elements hold opposite</p>
<p>positions; for that which is light, heavy, below or above in one place</p>
<p>will be found to be and become contrary and transverse and every way</p>
<p>diverse in relation to that which is light, heavy, below or above in</p>
<p>an opposite place. And about all of them this has to be</p>
<p>considered:-that the tendency of each towards its kindred element</p>
<p>makes the body which is moved heavy, and the place towards which the</p>
<p>motion tends below, but things which have an opposite tendency we call</p>
<p>by an opposite name. Such are the causes which we assign to these</p>
<p>phenomena. As to the smooth and the rough, any one who sees them can</p>
<p>explain the reason of them to another. For roughness is hardness</p>
<p>mingled with irregularity, and smoothness is produced by the joint</p>
<p>effect of uniformity and density.</p>
<p>The most important of the affections which concern the whole body</p>
<p>remains to be considered-that is, the cause of pleasure and pain in</p>
<p>the perceptions of which I have been speaking, and in all other things</p>
<p>which are perceived by sense through the parts of the body, and have</p>
<p>both pains and pleasures attendant on them. Let us imagine the</p>
<p>causes of every affection, whether of sense or not, to be of the</p>
<p>following nature, remembering that we have already distinguished</p>
<p>between the nature which is easy and which is hard to move; for this</p>
<p>is the direction in which we must hunt the prey which we mean to take.</p>
<p>A body which is of a nature to be easily moved, on receiving an</p>
<p>impression however slight, spreads abroad the motion in a circle,</p>
<p>the parts communicating with each other, until at last, reaching the</p>
<p>principle of mind, they announce the quality of the agent. But a</p>
<p>body of the opposite kind, being immobile, and not extending to the</p>
<p>surrounding region, merely receives the impression, and does not</p>
<p>stir any of the neighbouring parts; and since the parts do not</p>
<p>distribute the original impression to other parts, it has no effect of</p>
<p>motion on the whole animal, and therefore produces no effect on the</p>
<p>patient. This is true of the bones and hair and other more earthy</p>
<p>parts of the human body; whereas what was said above relates mainly to</p>
<p>sight and hearing, because they have in them the greatest amount of</p>
<p>fire and air. Now we must conceive of pleasure and pain in this way.</p>
<p>An impression produced in us contrary to nature and violent, if</p>
<p>sudden, is painful; and, again, the sudden return to nature is</p>
<p>pleasant; but a gentle and gradual return is imperceptible and vice</p>
<p>versa. On the other hand the impression of sense which is most</p>
<p>easily produced is most readily felt, but is not accompanied by</p>
<p>Pleasure or pain; such, for example, are the affections of the</p>
<p>sight, which, as we said above, is a body naturally uniting with our</p>
<p>body in the day-time; for cuttings and burnings and other</p>
<p>affections which happen to the sight do not give pain, nor is there</p>
<p>pleasure when the sight returns to its natural state; but the</p>
<p>sensations are dearest and strongest according to the manner in</p>
<p>which the eye is affected by the object, and itself strikes and</p>
<p>touches it; there is no violence either in the contraction or dilation</p>
<p>of the eye. But bodies formed of larger particles yield to the agent</p>
<p>only with a struggle; and then they impart their motions to the</p>
<p>whole and cause pleasure and pain-pain when alienated from their</p>
<p>natural conditions, and pleasure when restored to them. Things which</p>
<p>experience gradual withdrawings and emptyings of their nature, and</p>
<p>great and sudden replenishments, fail to perceive the emptying, but</p>
<p>are sensible of the replenishment; and so they occasion no pain, but</p>
<p>the greatest pleasure, to the mortal part of the soul, as is</p>
<p>manifest in the case of perfumes. But things which are changed all of</p>
<p>a sudden, and only gradually and with difficulty return to their own</p>
<p>nature, have effects in every way opposite to the former, as is</p>
<p>evident in the case of burnings and cuttings of the body.</p>
<p>Thus have we discussed the general affections of the whole body, and</p>
<p>the names of the agents which produce them. And now I will endeavour</p>
<p>to speak of the affections of particular parts, and the causes and</p>
<p>agents of them, as far as I am able. In the first place let us set</p>
<p>forth what was omitted when we were speaking of juices, concerning the</p>
<p>affections peculiar to the tongue. These too, like most of the other</p>
<p>affections, appear to be caused by certain contractions and dilations,</p>
<p>but they have besides more of roughness and smoothness than is found</p>
<p>in other affections; for whenever earthy particles enter into the</p>
<p>small veins which are the testing of the tongue, reaching to the</p>
<p>heart, and fall upon the moist, delicate portions of flesh-when, as</p>
<p>they are dissolved, they contract and dry up the little veins, they</p>
<p>are astringent if they are rougher, but if not so rough, then only</p>
<p>harsh. Those of them which are of an abstergent nature, and purge</p>
<p>the whole surface of the tongue, if they do it in excess, and so</p>
<p>encroach as to consume some part of the flesh itself, like potash</p>
<p>and soda, are all termed bitter. But the particles which are deficient</p>
<p>in the alkaline quality, and which cleanse only moderately, are called</p>
<p>salt, and having no bitterness or roughness, are regarded as rather</p>
<p>agreeable than otherwise. Bodies which share in and are made smooth by</p>
<p>the heat of the mouth, and which are inflamed, and again in turn</p>
<p>inflame that which heats them, and which are so light that they are</p>
<p>carried upwards to the sensations of the head, and cut all that</p>
<p>comes in their way, by reason of these qualities in them, are all</p>
<p>termed pungent. But when these same particles, refined by</p>
<p>putrefaction, enter into the narrow veins, and are duly proportioned</p>
<p>to the particles of earth and air which are there, they set them</p>
<p>whirling about one another, and while they are in a whirl cause them</p>
<p>to dash against and enter into one another, and so form hollows</p>
<p>surrounding the particles that enter-which watery vessels of air</p>
<p>(for a film of moisture, sometimes earthy, sometimes pure, is spread</p>
<p>around the air) are hollow spheres of water; and those of them which</p>
<p>are pure, are transparent, and are called bubbles, while those</p>
<p>composed of the earthy liquid, which is in a state of general</p>
<p>agitation and effervescence, are said to boil or ferment-of all</p>
<p>these affections the cause is termed acid. And there is the opposite</p>
<p>affection arising from an opposite cause, when the mass of entering</p>
<p>particles, immersed in the moisture of the mouth, is congenial to</p>
<p>the tongue, and smooths and oils over the roughness, and relaxes the</p>
<p>parts which are unnaturally contracted, and contracts the parts</p>
<p>which are relaxed, and disposes them all according to their</p>
<p>nature-that sort of remedy of violent affections is pleasant and</p>
<p>agreeable to every man, and has the name sweet. But enough of this.</p>
<p>The faculty of smell does not admit of differences of kind; for</p>
<p>all smells are of a half formed nature, and no element is so</p>
<p>proportioned as to have any smell. The veins about the nose are too</p>
<p>narrow to admit earth and water, and too wide to detain fire and</p>
<p>air; and for this reason no one ever perceives the smell of any of</p>
<p>them; but smells always proceed from bodies that are damp, or</p>
<p>putrefying, or liquefying, or evaporating, and are perceptible only in</p>
<p>the intermediate state, when water is changing into air and air into</p>
<p>water; and all of them are either vapor or mist. That which is passing</p>
<p>out of air into water is mist, and that which is passing from water</p>
<p>into air is vapour; and hence all smells are thinner than water and</p>
<p>thicker than air. The proof of this is, that when there is any</p>
<p>obstruction to the respiration, and a man draws in his breath by</p>
<p>force, then no smell filters through, but the air without the smell</p>
<p>alone penetrates. Wherefore the varieties of smell have no name, and</p>
<p>they have not many, or definite and simple kinds; but they are</p>
<p>distinguished only painful and pleasant, the one sort irritating and</p>
<p>disturbing the whole cavity which is situated between the head and the</p>
<p>navel, the other having a soothing influence, and restoring this</p>
<p>same region to an agreeable and natural condition.</p>
<p>In considering the third kind of sense, hearing, we must speak of</p>
<p>the causes in which it originates. We may in general assume sound to</p>
<p>be a blow which passes through the ears, and is transmitted by means</p>
<p>of the air, the brain, and the blood, to the soul, and that hearing is</p>
<p>the vibration of this blow, which begins in the head and ends in the</p>
<p>region of the liver. The sound which moves swiftly is acute, and the</p>
<p>sound which moves slowly is grave, and that which is regular is</p>
<p>equable and smooth, and the reverse is harsh. A great body of sound is</p>
<p>loud, and a small body of sound the reverse. Respecting the</p>
<p>harmonies of sound I must hereafter speak.</p>
<p>There is a fourth class of sensible things, having many intricate</p>
<p>varieties, which must now be distinguished. They are called by the</p>
<p>general name of colours, and are a flame which emanates from every</p>
<p>sort of body, and has particles corresponding to the sense of sight. I</p>
<p>have spoken already, in what has preceded, of the causes which</p>
<p>generate sight, and in this place it will be natural and suitable to</p>
<p>give a rational theory of colours.</p>
<p>Of the particles coming from other bodies which fall upon the sight,</p>
<p>some are smaller and some are larger, and some are equal to the</p>
<p>parts of the sight itself. Those which are equal are imperceptible,</p>
<p>and we call them transparent. The larger produce contraction, the</p>
<p>smaller dilation, in the sight, exercising a power akin to that of hot</p>
<p>and cold bodies on the flesh, or of astringent bodies on the tongue,</p>
<p>or of those heating bodies which we termed pungent. White and black</p>
<p>are similar effects of contraction and dilation in another sphere, and</p>
<p>for this reason have a different appearance. Wherefore, we ought to</p>
<p>term white that which dilates the visual ray, and the opposite of this</p>
<p>is black. There is also a swifter motion of a different sort of fire</p>
<p>which strikes and dilates the ray of sight until it reaches the</p>
<p>eyes, forcing a way through their passages and melting them, and</p>
<p>eliciting from them a union of fire and water which we call tears,</p>
<p>being itself an opposite fire which comes to them from an opposite</p>
<p>direction-the inner fire flashes forth like lightning, and the outer</p>
<p>finds a way in and is extinguished in the moisture, and all sorts of</p>
<p>colours are generated by the mixture. This affection is termed</p>
<p>dazzling, and the object which produces it is called bright and</p>
<p>flashing. There is another sort of fire which is intermediate, and</p>
<p>which reaches and mingles with the moisture of the eye without</p>
<p>flashing; and in this, the fire mingling with the ray of the moisture,</p>
<p>produces a colour like blood, to which we give the name of red. A</p>
<p>bright hue mingled with red and white gives the colour called</p>
<p>auburn. The law of proportion, however, according to which the several</p>
<p>colours are formed, even if a man knew he would be foolish in telling,</p>
<p>for he could not give any necessary reason, nor indeed any tolerable</p>
<p>or probable explanation of them. Again, red, when mingled with black</p>
<p>and white, becomes purple, but it becomes umber when the colours are</p>
<p>burnt as well as mingled and the black is more thoroughly mixed with</p>
<p>them. Flame colour is produced by a union of auburn and dun, and dun</p>
<p>by an admixture of black and white; pale yellow, by an admixture of</p>
<p>white and auburn. White and bright meeting, and falling upon a full</p>
<p>black, become dark blue, and when dark blue mingles with white, a</p>
<p>light blue colour is formed, as flame-colour with black makes leek</p>
<p>green. There will be no difficulty in seeing how and by what</p>
<p>mixtures the colours derived from these are made according to the</p>
<p>rules of probability. He, however, who should attempt to verify all</p>
<p>this by experiment, would forget the difference of the human and</p>
<p>divine nature. For God only has the knowledge and also the power which</p>
<p>are able to combine many things into one and again resolve the one</p>
<p>into many. But no man either is or ever will be able to accomplish</p>
<p>either the one or the other operation.</p>
<p>These are the elements, thus of necessity then subsisting, which the</p>
<p>creator of the fairest and best of created things associated with</p>
<p>himself, when he made the self-sufficing and most perfect God, using</p>
<p>the necessary causes as his ministers in the accomplishment of his</p>
<p>work, but himself contriving the good in all his creations.</p>
<p>Wherefore we may distinguish two sorts of causes, the one divine and</p>
<p>the other necessary, and may seek for the divine in all things, as far</p>
<p>as our nature admits, with a view to the blessed life; but the</p>
<p>necessary kind only for the sake of the divine, considering that</p>
<p>without them and when isolated from them, these higher things for</p>
<p>which we look cannot be apprehended or received or in any way shared</p>
<p>by us.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, that we have now prepared for our use the various</p>
<p>classes of causes which are the material out of which the remainder of</p>
<p>our discourse must be woven, just as wood is the material of the</p>
<p>carpenter, let us revert in a few words to the point at which we</p>
<p>began, and then endeavour to add on a suitable ending to the beginning</p>
<p>of our tale.</p>
<p>As I said at first, when all things were in disorder God created</p>
<p>in each thing in relation to itself, and in all things in relation</p>
<p>to each other, all the measures and harmonies which they could</p>
<p>possibly receive. For in those days nothing had any proportion</p>
<p>except by accident; nor did any of the things which now have names</p>
<p>deserve to be named at all-as, for example, fire, water, and the</p>
<p>rest of the elements. All these the creator first set in order, and</p>
<p>out of them he constructed the universe, which was a single animal</p>
<p>comprehending in itself all other animals, mortal and immortal. Now of</p>
<p>the divine, he himself was the creator, but the creation of the mortal</p>
<p>he committed to his offspring. And they, imitating him, received</p>
<p>from him the immortal principle of the soul; and around this they</p>
<p>proceeded to fashion a mortal body, and. made it to be the vehicle</p>
<p>of the so and constructed within the body a soul of another nature</p>
<p>which was mortal, subject to terrible and irresistible</p>
<p>affections-first of all, pleasure, the greatest incitement to evil;</p>
<p>then, pain, which deters from good; also rashness and fear, two</p>
<p>foolish counsellors, anger hard to be appeased, and hope easily led</p>
<p>astray-these they mingled with irrational sense and with all-daring</p>
<p>love according to necessary laws, and so framed man. Wherefore,</p>
<p>fearing to pollute the divine any more than was absolutely</p>
<p>unavoidable, they gave to the mortal nature a separate habitation in</p>
<p>another part of the body, placing the neck between them to be the</p>
<p>isthmus and boundary, which they constructed between the head and</p>
<p>breast, to keep them apart. And in the breast, and in what is termed</p>
<p>the thorax, they encased the mortal soul; and as the one part of</p>
<p>this was superior and the other inferior they divided the cavity of</p>
<p>the thorax into two parts, as the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s apartments are</p>
<p>divided in houses, and placed the midriff to be a wall of partition</p>
<p>between them. That part of the inferior soul which is endowed with</p>
<p>courage and passion and loves contention they settled nearer the head,</p>
<p>midway between the midriff and the neck, in order that it might be</p>
<p>under the rule of reason and might join with it in controlling and</p>
<p>restraining the desires when they are no longer willing of their own</p>
<p>accord to obey the word of command issuing from the citadel.</p>
<p>The heart, the knot of the veins and the fountain of the blood which</p>
<p>races through all the limbs was set in the place of guard, that when</p>
<p>the might of passion was roused by reason making proclamation of any</p>
<p>wrong assailing them from without or being perpetrated by the</p>
<p>desires within, quickly the whole power of feeling in the body,</p>
<p>perceiving these commands and threats, might obey and follow through</p>
<p>every turn and alley, and thus allow the principle of the best to have</p>
<p>the command in all of them. But the gods, foreknowing that the</p>
<p>palpitation of the heart in the expectation of danger and the swelling</p>
<p>and excitement of passion was caused by fire, formed and implanted</p>
<p>as a supporter to the heart the lung, which was, in the first place,</p>
<p>soft and bloodless, and also had within hollows like the pores of a</p>
<p>sponge, in order that by receiving the breath and the drink, it</p>
<p>might give coolness and the power of respiration and alleviate the</p>
<p>heat. Wherefore they cut the air-channels leading to the lung, and</p>
<p>placed the lung about the heart as a soft spring, that, when passion</p>
<p>was rife within, the heart, beating against a yielding body, might</p>
<p>be cooled and suffer less, and might thus become more ready to join</p>
<p>with passion in the service of reason.</p>
<p>The part of the soul which desires meats and drinks and the other</p>
<p>things of which it has need by reason of the bodily nature, they</p>
<p>placed between the midriff and the boundary of the navel, contriving</p>
<p>in all this region a sort of manger for the food of the body; and</p>
<p>there they bound it down like a wild animal which was chained up</p>
<p>with man, and must be nourished if man was to exist. They appointed</p>
<p>this lower creation his place here in order that he might be always</p>
<p>feeding at the manger, and have his dwelling as far as might be from</p>
<p>the council-chamber, making as little noise and disturbance as</p>
<p>possible, and permitting the best part to advise quietly for the</p>
<p>good of the whole. And knowing that this lower principle in man</p>
<p>would not comprehend reason, and even if attaining to some degree of</p>
<p>perception would never naturally care for rational notions, but that</p>
<p>it would be led away by phantoms and visions night and day-to be a</p>
<p>remedy for this, God combined with it the liver, and placed it in</p>
<p>the house of the lower nature, contriving that it should be solid</p>
<p>and smooth, and bright and sweet, and should also have a bitter</p>
<p>quality, in order that the power of thought, which proceeds from the</p>
<p>mind, might be reflected as in a mirror which receives likenesses of</p>
<p>objects and gives back images of them to the sight; and so might</p>
<p>strike terror into the desires, when, making use of the bitter part of</p>
<p>the liver, to which it is akin, it comes threatening and invading, and</p>
<p>diffusing this bitter element swiftly through the whole liver produces</p>
<p>colours like bile, and contracting every part makes it wrinkled and</p>
<p>rough; and twisting out of its right place and contorting the lobe and</p>
<p>closing and shutting up the vessels and gates, causes pain and</p>
<p>loathing. And the converse happens when some gentle inspiration of the</p>
<p>understanding pictures images of an opposite character, and allays the</p>
<p>bile and bitterness by refusing to stir or touch the nature opposed to</p>
<p>itself, but by making use of the natural sweetness of the liver,</p>
<p>corrects all things and makes them to be right and smooth and free,</p>
<p>and renders the portion of the soul which resides about the liver</p>
<p>happy and joyful, enabling it to pass the night in peace, and to</p>
<p>practise divination in sleep, inasmuch as it has no share in mind</p>
<p>and reason. For the authors of our being, remembering the command of</p>
<p>their father when he bade them create the human race as good as they</p>
<p>could, that they might correct our inferior parts and make them to</p>
<p>attain a measure of truth, placed in the liver the seat of divination.</p>
<p>And herein is a proof that God has given the art of divination not</p>
<p>to the wisdom, but to the foolishness of man. No man, when in his</p>
<p>wits, attains prophetic truth and inspiration; but when he receives</p>
<p>the inspired word, either his intelligence is enthralled in sleep,</p>
<p>or he is demented by some distemper or possession. And he who would</p>
<p>understand what he remembers to have been said, whether in a dream</p>
<p>or when he was awake, by the prophetic and inspired nature, or would</p>
<p>determine by reason the meaning of the apparitions which he has</p>
<p>seen, and what indications they afford to this man or that, of past,</p>
<p>present or future good and evil, must first recover his wits. But,</p>
<p>while he continues demented, he cannot judge of the visions which he</p>
<p>sees or the words which he utters; the ancient saying is very true,</p>
<p>that &quot;only a man who has his wits can act or judge about himself and</p>
<p>his own affairs.&quot; And for this reason it is customary to appoint</p>
<p>interpreters to be judges of the true inspiration. Some persons call</p>
<p>them prophets; they are quite unaware that they are only the</p>
<p>expositors of dark sayings and visions, and are not to be called</p>
<p>prophets at all, but only interpreters of prophecy.</p>
<p>Such is the nature of the liver, which is placed as we have</p>
<p>described in order that it may give prophetic intimations. During</p>
<p>the life of each individual these intimations are plainer, but after</p>
<p>his death the liver becomes blind, and delivers oracles too obscure to</p>
<p>be intelligible. The neighbouring organ [the spleen] is situated on</p>
<p>the left-hand side, and is constructed with a view of keeping the</p>
<p>liver bright and pure-like a napkin, always ready prepared and at hand</p>
<p>to clean the mirror. And hence, when any impurities arise in the</p>
<p>region of the liver by reason of disorders of the body, the loose</p>
<p>nature of the spleen, which is composed of a hollow and bloodless</p>
<p>tissue, receives them all and dears them away, and when filled with</p>
<p>the unclean matter, swells and festers, but, again, when the body is</p>
<p>purged, settles down into the same place as before, and is humbled.</p>
<p>Concerning the soul, as to which part is mortal and which divine,</p>
<p>and how and why they are separated, and where located, if God</p>
<p>acknowledges that we have spoken the truth, then, and then only, can</p>
<p>we be confident; still, we may venture to assert that what has been</p>
<p>said by us is probable, and will be rendered more probable by</p>
<p>investigation. Let us assume thus much.</p>
<p>The creation of the rest of follows next in order, and this we may</p>
<p>investigate in a similar manner. And it appears to be very meet that</p>
<p>the body should be framed on the following principles:-</p>
<p>The authors of our race were aware that we should be intemperate</p>
<p>in eating and drinking, and take a good deal more than was necessary</p>
<p>or proper, by reason of gluttony. In order then that disease might not</p>
<p>quickly destroy us, and lest our mortal race should perish without</p>
<p>fulfilling its end-intending to provide against this, the gods made</p>
<p>what is called the lower belly, to be a receptacle for the superfluous</p>
<p>meat and drink, and formed the convolution of the bowels, so that</p>
<p>the food might be prevented from passing quickly through and</p>
<p>compelling the body to require more food, thus producing insatiable</p>
<p>gluttony, and making the whole race an enemy to philosophy and</p>
<p>music, and rebellious against the divinest element within us.</p>
<p>The bones and flesh, and other similar parts of us, were made as</p>
<p>follows. The first principle of all of them was the generation of</p>
<p>the marrow. For the bonds of life which unite the soul with the body</p>
<p>are made fast there, and they are the root and foundation of the human</p>
<p>race. The marrow itself is created out of other materials: God took</p>
<p>such of the primary triangles as were straight and smooth, and were</p>
<p>adapted by their perfection to produce fire and water, and air and</p>
<p>earth-these, I say, he separated from their kinds, and mingling them</p>
<p>in due proportions with one another, made the marrow out of them to be</p>
<p>a universal seed of the whole race of mankind; and in this seed he</p>
<p>then planted and enclosed the souls, and in the original</p>
<p>distribution gave to the marrow as many and various forms as the</p>
<p>different kinds of souls were hereafter to receive. That which, like a</p>
<p>field, was to receive the divine seed, he made round every way, and</p>
<p>called that portion of the marrow, brain, intending that, when an</p>
<p>animal was perfected, the vessel containing this substance should be</p>
<p>the head; but that which was intended to contain the remaining and</p>
<p>mortal part of the soul he distributed into figures at once around and</p>
<p>elongated, and he called them all by the name &quot;marrow&quot;; and to</p>
<p>these, as to anchors, fastening the bonds of the whole soul, he</p>
<p>proceeded to fashion around them the entire framework of our body,</p>
<p>constructing for the marrow, first of all a complete covering of bone.</p>
<p>Bone was composed by him in the following manner. Having sifted pure</p>
<p>and smooth earth he kneaded it and wetted it with marrow, and after</p>
<p>that he put it into fire and then into water, and once more into</p>
<p>fire and again into water-in this way by frequent transfers from one</p>
<p>to the other he made it insoluble by either. Out of this he fashioned,</p>
<p>as in a lathe, a globe made of bone, which he placed around the brain,</p>
<p>and in this he left a narrow opening; and around the marrow of the</p>
<p>neck and back he formed vertebrae which he placed under one another</p>
<p>like pivots, beginning at the head and extending through the whole</p>
<p>of the trunk. Thus wishing to preserve the entire seed, he enclosed it</p>
<p>in a stone-like casing, inserting joints, and using in the formation</p>
<p>of them the power of the other or diverse as an intermediate nature,</p>
<p>that they might have motion and flexure. Then again, considering</p>
<p>that the bone would be too brittle and inflexible, and when heated and</p>
<p>again cooled would soon mortify and destroy the seed within-having</p>
<p>this in view, he contrived the sinews and the flesh, that so binding</p>
<p>all the members together by the sinews, which admitted of being</p>
<p>stretched and relaxed about the vertebrae, he might thus make the body</p>
<p>capable of flexion and extension, while the flesh would serve as a</p>
<p>protection against the summer heat and against the winter cold, and</p>
<p>also against falls, softly and easily yielding to external bodies,</p>
<p>like articles made of felt; and containing in itself a warm moisture</p>
<p>which in summer exudes and makes the surface damp, would impart a</p>
<p>nature coolness to the whole body; and again in winter by the help</p>
<p>of this internal warmth would form a very tolerable defence against</p>
<p>the frost which surrounds it and attacks it from without. He who</p>
<p>modelled us, considering these things, mixed earth with fire and water</p>
<p>and blended them; and making a ferment of acid and salt, he mingled it</p>
<p>with them and formed soft and succulent flesh. As for the sinews, he</p>
<p>made them of a mixture of bone and unfermented flesh, attempered so as</p>
<p>to be in a mean, and gave them a yellow colour; wherefore the sinews</p>
<p>have a firmer and more glutinous nature than flesh, but a softer and</p>
<p>moister nature than the bones. With these God covered the bones and</p>
<p>marrow, binding them together by sinews, and then enshrouded them</p>
<p>all in an upper covering of flesh. The more living and sensitive of</p>
<p>the bones he enclosed in the thinnest film of flesh, and those which</p>
<p>had the least life within them in the thickest and most solid flesh.</p>
<p>So again on the joints of the bones, where reason indicated that no</p>
<p>more was required, he placed only a thin covering of flesh, that it</p>
<p>might not interfere with the flexion of our bodies and make them</p>
<p>unwieldy because difficult to move; and also that it might not, by</p>
<p>being crowded and pressed and matted together, destroy sensation by</p>
<p>reason of its hardness, and impair the memory and dull the edge of</p>
<p>intelligence. Wherefore also the thighs and the shanks and the hips,</p>
<p>and the bones of the arms and the forearms, and other parts which have</p>
<p>no joints, and the inner bones, which on account of the rarity of</p>
<p>the soul in the marrow are destitute of reason-all these are</p>
<p>abundantly provided with flesh; but such as have mind in them are in</p>
<p>general less fleshy, except where the creator has made some part</p>
<p>solely of flesh in order to give sensation-as, for example, the</p>
<p>tongue. But commonly this is not the case. For the nature which</p>
<p>comes into being and grows up in us by a law of necessity, does not</p>
<p>admit of the combination of solid bone and much flesh with acute</p>
<p>perceptions. More than any other part the framework of the head</p>
<p>would have had them, if they could have co-existed, and the human</p>
<p>race, having a strong and fleshy and sinewy head, would have had a</p>
<p>life twice or many times as long as it now has, and also more</p>
<p>healthy and free from pain.</p>
<p>But our creators, considering whether they should make a</p>
<p>longer-lived race which was worse, or a shorter-lived race which was</p>
<p>better, came to the conclusion that every one ought to prefer a</p>
<p>shorter span of life, which was better, to a longer one, which was</p>
<p>worse; and therefore they covered the head with thin bone, but not</p>
<p>with flesh and sinews, since it had no joints; and thus the head was</p>
<p>added, having more wisdom and sensation than the rest of the body, but</p>
<p>also being in every man far weaker. For these reasons and after this</p>
<p>manner God placed the sinews at the extremity of the head, in a circle</p>
<p>round the neck, and glued them together by the principle of likeness</p>
<p>and fastened the extremities of the jawbones to them below the face,</p>
<p>and the other sinews he dispersed throughout the body, fastening</p>
<p>limb to limb. The framers of us framed the mouth, as now arranged,</p>
<p>having teeth and tongue and lips, with a view to the necessary and the</p>
<p>good, contriving the way in for necessary purposes, the way out for</p>
<p>the best purposes; for that is necessary which enters in and gives</p>
<p>food to the body; but the river of speech, which flows out of a man</p>
<p>and ministers to the intelligence, is the fairest and noblest of all</p>
<p>streams. Still the head could neither be left a bare frame of bones,</p>
<p>on account of the extremes of heat and cold in the different</p>
<p>seasons, nor yet be allowed to be wholly covered, and so become dull</p>
<p>and senseless by reason of an overgrowth of flesh. The fleshy nature</p>
<p>was not therefore wholly dried up, but a large sort of peel was parted</p>
<p>off and remained over, which is now called the skin. This met and grew</p>
<p>by the help of the cerebral moisture, and became the circular</p>
<p>envelopment of the head. And the moisture, rising up under the</p>
<p>sutures, watered and closed in the skin upon the crown, forming a sort</p>
<p>of knot. The diversity of the sutures was caused by the power of the</p>
<p>courses of the soul and of the food, and the more these struggled</p>
<p>against one another the more numerous they became, and fewer if the</p>
<p>struggle were less violent. This skin the divine power pierced all</p>
<p>round with fire, and out of the punctures which were thus made the</p>
<p>moisture issued forth, and the liquid and heat which was pure came</p>
<p>away, and a mixed part which was composed of the same material as</p>
<p>the skin, and had a fineness equal to the punctures, was borne up by</p>
<p>its own impulse and extended far outside the head, but being too</p>
<p>slow to escape, was thrust back by the external air, and rolled up</p>
<p>underneath the skin, where it took root. Thus the hair sprang up in</p>
<p>the skin, being akin to it because it is like threads of leather,</p>
<p>but rendered harder and closer through the pressure of the cold, by</p>
<p>which each hair, while in process of separation from the skin, is</p>
<p>compressed and cooled. Wherefore the creator formed the head hairy,</p>
<p>making use of the causes which I have mentioned, and reflecting also</p>
<p>that instead of flesh the brain needed the hair to be a light covering</p>
<p>or guard, which would give shade in summer and shelter in winter,</p>
<p>and at the same time would not impede our quickness of perception.</p>
<p>From the combination of sinew, skin, and bone, in the structure of the</p>
<p>finger, there arises a triple compound, which, when dried up, takes</p>
<p>the form of one hard skin partaking of all three natures, and was</p>
<p>fabricated by these second causes, but designed by mind which is the</p>
<p>principal cause with an eye to the future. For our creators well</p>
<p>knew that women and other animals would some day be framed out of men,</p>
<p>and they further knew that many animals would require the use of nails</p>
<p>for many purposes; wherefore they fashioned in men at their first</p>
<p>creation the rudiments of nails. For this purpose and for these</p>
<p>reasons they caused skin, hair, and nails to grow at the extremities</p>
<p>of the limbs. And now that all the parts and members of the mortal</p>
<p>animal had come together, since its life of necessity consisted of</p>
<p>fire and breath, and it therefore wasted away by dissolution and</p>
<p>depletion, the gods contrived the following remedy: They mingled a</p>
<p>nature akin to that of man with other forms and perceptions, and</p>
<p>thus created another kind of animal. These are the trees and plants</p>
<p>and seeds which have been improved by cultivation and are now</p>
<p>domesticated among us; anciently there were only the will kinds, which</p>
<p>are older than the cultivated. For everything that partakes of life</p>
<p>may be truly called a living being, and the animal of which we are now</p>
<p>speaking partakes of the third kind of soul, which is said to be</p>
<p>seated between the midriff and the navel, having no part in opinion or</p>
<p>reason or mind, but only in feelings of pleasure and pain and the</p>
<p>desires which accompany them. For this nature is always in a passive</p>
<p>state, revolving in and about itself, repelling the motion from</p>
<p>without and using its own, and accordingly is not endowed by nature</p>
<p>with the power of observing or reflecting on its own concerns.</p>
<p>Wherefore it lives and does not differ from a living being, but is</p>
<p>fixed and rooted in the same spot, having no power of self-motion.</p>
<p>Now after the superior powers had created all these natures to be</p>
<p>food for us who are of the inferior nature, they cut various</p>
<p>channels through the body as through a garden, that it might be</p>
<p>watered as from a running stream. In the first place, they cut two</p>
<p>hidden channels or veins down the back where the skin and the flesh</p>
<p>join, which answered severally to the right and left side of the body.</p>
<p>These they let down along the backbone, so as to have the marrow of</p>
<p>generation between them, where it was most likely to flourish, and</p>
<p>in order that the stream coming down from above might flow freely to</p>
<p>the other parts, and equalise the irrigation. In the next place,</p>
<p>they divided the veins about the head, and interlacing them, they sent</p>
<p>them in opposite directions; those coming from the right side they</p>
<p>sent to the left of the body, and those from the left they diverted</p>
<p>towards the right, so that they and the skin might together form a</p>
<p>bond which should fasten the head to the body, since the crown of</p>
<p>the head was not encircled by sinews; and also in order that the</p>
<p>sensations from both sides might be distributed over the whole body.</p>
<p>And next, they ordered the water-courses of the body in a manner which</p>
<p>I will describe, and which will be more easily understood if we</p>
<p>begin by admitting that all things which have lesser parts retain</p>
<p>the greater, but the greater cannot retain the lesser. Now of all</p>
<p>natures fire has the smallest parts, and therefore penetrates</p>
<p>through earth and water and air and their compounds, nor can</p>
<p>anything hold it. And a similar principle applies to the human</p>
<p>belly; for when meats and drinks enter it, it holds them, but it</p>
<p>cannot hold air and fire, because the particles of which they</p>
<p>consist are smaller than its own structure.</p>
<p>These elements, therefore, God employed for the sake of distributing</p>
<p>moisture from the belly into the veins, weaving together network of</p>
<p>fire and air like a weel, having at the entrance two lesser weels;</p>
<p>further he constructed one of these with two openings, and from the</p>
<p>lesser weels he extended cords reaching all round to the extremities</p>
<p>of the network. All the interior of the net he made of fire, but the</p>
<p>lesser weels and their cavity, of air. The network he took and</p>
<p>spread over the newly-formed animal in the following manner:-He let</p>
<p>the lesser weels pass into the mouth; there were two of them, and</p>
<p>one he let down by the air-pipes into the lungs, the other by the side</p>
<p>of the air-pipes into the belly. The former he divided into two</p>
<p>branches, both of which he made to meet at the channels of the nose,</p>
<p>so that when the way through the mouth did not act, the streams of the</p>
<p>mouth as well were replenished through the nose. With the other cavity</p>
<p>(i.e. of the greater weel) he enveloped the hollow parts of the</p>
<p>body, and at one time he made all this to flow into the lesser</p>
<p>weels, quite gently, for they are composed of air, and at another time</p>
<p>he caused the lesser weels to flow back again; and the net he made</p>
<p>to find a way in and out through the pores of the body, and the rays</p>
<p>of fire which are bound fast within followed the passage of the air</p>
<p>either way, never at any time ceasing so long as the mortal being</p>
<p>holds together. This process, as we affirm, the name-giver named</p>
<p>inspiration and expiration. And all this movement, active as well as</p>
<p>passive, takes place in order that the body, being watered and cooled,</p>
<p>may receive nourishment and life; for when the respiration is going in</p>
<p>and out, and the fire, which is fast bound within, follows it, and</p>
<p>ever and anon moving to and fro, enters through the belly and</p>
<p>reaches the meat and drink, it dissolves them, and dividing them</p>
<p>into small portions and guiding them through the passages where it</p>
<p>goes, pumps them as from a fountain into the channels of the veins,</p>
<p>and makes the stream of the veins flow through the body as through a</p>
<p>conduit.</p>
<p>Let us once more consider the phenomena of respiration, and</p>
<p>enquire into the causes which have made it what it is. They are as</p>
<p>follows:-Seeing that there is no such thing as a vacuum into which any</p>
<p>of those things which are moved can enter, and the breath is carried</p>
<p>from us into the external air, the next point is, as will be dear to</p>
<p>every one, that it does not go into a vacant space, but pushes its</p>
<p>neighbour out of its place, and that which is thrust out in turn</p>
<p>drives out its neighbour; and in this everything of necessity at</p>
<p>last comes round to that place from whence the breath came forth,</p>
<p>and enters in there, and following the breath, fills up the vacant</p>
<p>space; and this goes on like the rotation of a wheel, because there</p>
<p>can be no such thing as a vacuum. Wherefore also the breast and the</p>
<p>lungs, when they emit the breath, are replenished by the air which</p>
<p>surrounds the body and which enters in through the pores of the</p>
<p>flesh and is driven round in a circle; and again, the air which is</p>
<p>sent away and passes out through the body forces the breath inwards</p>
<p>through the passage of the mouth and the nostrils. Now the origin of</p>
<p>this movement may be supposed to be as follows. In the interior of</p>
<p>every animal the hottest part is that which is around the blood and</p>
<p>veins; it is in a manner on internal fountain of fire, which we</p>
<p>compare to the network of a creel, being woven all of fire and</p>
<p>extended through the centre of the body, while the-outer parts are</p>
<p>composed of air. Now we must admit that heat naturally proceeds</p>
<p>outward to its own place and to its kindred element; and as there</p>
<p>are two exits for the heat, the out through the body, and the other</p>
<p>through the mouth and nostrils, when it moves towards the one, it</p>
<p>drives round the air at the other, and that which is driven round</p>
<p>falls into the fire and becomes warm, and that which goes forth is</p>
<p>cooled. But when the heat changes its place, and the particles at</p>
<p>the other exit grow warmer, the hotter air inclining in that direction</p>
<p>and carried towards its native element, fire, pushes round the air</p>
<p>at the other; and this being affected in the same way and</p>
<p>communicating the same impulse, a circular motion swaying to and</p>
<p>from is produced by the double process, which we call inspiration</p>
<p>and expiration.</p>
<p>The phenomena of medical cupping-glasses and of the swallowing of</p>
<p>drink and of the projection of bodies, whether discharged in the air</p>
<p>or bowled along the ground, are to be investigated on a similar</p>
<p>principle; and swift and slow sounds, which appear to be high and low,</p>
<p>and are sometimes discordant on account of their inequality, and</p>
<p>then again harmonical on account of the equality of the motion which</p>
<p>they excite in us. For when the motions of the antecedent swifter</p>
<p>sounds begin to pause and the two are equalised, the slower sounds</p>
<p>overtake the swifter and then propel them. When they overtake them</p>
<p>they do not intrude a new and discordant motion, but introduce the</p>
<p>beginnings of a slower, which answers to the swifter as it dies</p>
<p>away, thus producing a single mixed expression out of high and low,</p>
<p>whence arises a pleasure which even the unwise feel, and which to</p>
<p>the wise becomes a higher sort of delight, being an imitation of</p>
<p>divine harmony in mortal motions. Moreover, as to the flowing of</p>
<p>water, the fall of the thunderbolt, and the marvels that are</p>
<p>observed about the attraction of amber and the Heraclean stones,-in</p>
<p>none of these cases is there any attraction; but he who investigates</p>
<p>rightly, will find that such wonderful phenomena are attributable to</p>
<p>the combination of certain conditions-the non-existence of a vacuum,</p>
<p>the fact that objects push one another round, and that they change</p>
<p>places, passing severally into their proper positions as they are</p>
<p>divided or combined</p>
<p>Such as we have seen, is the nature and such are the causes of</p>
<p>respiration-the subject in which this discussion originated. For the</p>
<p>fire cuts the food and following the breath surges up within, fire and</p>
<p>breath rising together and filling the veins by drawing up out of</p>
<p>the belly and pouring into them the cut portions of the food; and so</p>
<p>the streams of food are kept flowing through the whole body in all</p>
<p>animals. And fresh cuttings from kindred substances, whether the</p>
<p>fruits of the earth or herb of the field, which God planted to be</p>
<p>our daily food, acquire all sorts of colours by their inter-mixture;</p>
<p>but red is the most pervading of them, being created by the cutting</p>
<p>action of fire and by the impression which it makes on a moist</p>
<p>substance; and hence the liquid which circulates in the body has a</p>
<p>colour such as we have described. The liquid itself we call blood,</p>
<p>which nourishes the flesh and the whole body, whence all parts are</p>
<p>watered and empty places filled.</p>
<p>Now the process of repletion and evacuation is effected after the</p>
<p>manner of the universal motion by which all kindred substances are</p>
<p>drawn towards one another. For the external elements which surround us</p>
<p>are always causing us to consume away, and distributing and sending</p>
<p>off like to like; the particles of blood, too, which are divided and</p>
<p>contained within the frame of the animal as in a sort of heaven, are</p>
<p>compelled to imitate the motion of the universe. Each, therefore, of</p>
<p>the divided parts within us, being carried to its kindred nature,</p>
<p>replenishes the void. When more is taken away than flows in, then we</p>
<p>decay, and when less, we grow and increase.</p>
<p>The frame of the entire creature when young has the triangles of</p>
<p>each kind new, and may be compared to the keel of a vessel which is</p>
<p>just off the stocks; they are locked firmly together and yet the whole</p>
<p>mass is soft and delicate, being freshly formed of marrow and nurtured</p>
<p>on milk. Now when the triangles out of which meats and drinks are</p>
<p>composed come in from without, and are comprehended in the body, being</p>
<p>older and weaker than the triangles already there, the frame of the</p>
<p>body gets the better of them and its newer triangles cut them up,</p>
<p>and so the animal grows great, being nourished by a multitude of</p>
<p>similar particles. But when the roots of the triangles are loosened by</p>
<p>having undergone many conflicts with many things in the course of</p>
<p>time, they are no longer able to cut or assimilate the food which</p>
<p>enters, but are themselves easily divided by the bodies which come</p>
<p>in from without. In this way every animal is overcome and decays,</p>
<p>and this affection is called old age. And at last, when the bonds by</p>
<p>which the triangles of the marrow are united no longer hold, and are</p>
<p>parted by the strain of existence, they in turn loosen the bonds of</p>
<p>the soul, and she, obtaining a natural release, flies away with joy.</p>
<p>For that which takes place according to nature is pleasant, but that</p>
<p>which is contrary to nature is painful. And thus death, if caused by</p>
<p>disease or produced by wounds, is painful and violent; but that sort</p>
<p>of death which comes with old age and fulfils the debt of nature is</p>
<p>the easiest of deaths, and is accompanied with pleasure rather than</p>
<p>with pain.</p>
<p>Now every one can see whence diseases arise. There are four</p>
<p>natures out of which the body is compacted, earth and fire and water</p>
<p>and air, and the unnatural excess or defect of these, or the change of</p>
<p>any of them from its own natural place into another, or-since there</p>
<p>are more kinds than one of fire and of the other elements-the</p>
<p>assumption by any of these of a wrong kind, or any similar</p>
<p>irregularity, produces disorders and diseases; for when any of them is</p>
<p>produced or changed in a manner contrary to nature, the parts which</p>
<p>were previously cool grow warm, and those which were dry become moist,</p>
<p>and the light become heavy, and the heavy light; all sorts of</p>
<p>changes occur. For, as we affirm, a thing can only remain the same</p>
<p>with itself, whole and sound, when the same is added to it, or</p>
<p>subtracted from it, in the same respect and in the same manner and</p>
<p>in due proportion; and whatever comes or goes away in violation of</p>
<p>these laws causes all manner of changes and infinite diseases and</p>
<p>corruptions. Now there is a second class of structures which are</p>
<p>also natural, and this affords a second opportunity of observing</p>
<p>diseases to him who would understand them. For whereas marrow and bone</p>
<p>and flesh and sinews are composed of the four elements, and the blood,</p>
<p>though after another manner, is likewise formed out of them, most</p>
<p>diseases originate in the way which I have described; but the worst of</p>
<p>all owe their severity to the fact that the generation of these</p>
<p>substances stances in a wrong order; they are then destroyed. For</p>
<p>the natural order is that the flesh and sinews should be made of</p>
<p>blood, the sinews out of the fibres to which they are akin, and the</p>
<p>flesh out of the dots which are formed when the fibres are</p>
<p>separated. And the glutinous and rich matter which comes away from the</p>
<p>sinews and the flesh, not only glues the flesh to the bones, but</p>
<p>nourishes and imparts growth to the bone which surrounds the marrow;</p>
<p>and by reason of the solidity of the bones, that which filters through</p>
<p>consists of the purest and smoothest and oiliest sort of triangles,</p>
<p>dropping like dew from the bones and watering the marrow.</p>
<p>Now when each process takes place in this order, health commonly</p>
<p>results; when in the opposite order, disease. For when the flesh</p>
<p>becomes decomposed and sends back the wasting substance into the</p>
<p>veins, then an over-supply of blood of diverse kinds, mingling with</p>
<p>air in the veins, having variegated colours and bitter properties,</p>
<p>as well as acid and saline qualities, contains all sorts of bile and</p>
<p>serum and phlegm. For all things go the wrong way, and having become</p>
<p>corrupted, first they taint the blood itself, and then ceasing to give</p>
<p>nourishment the body they are carried along the veins in all</p>
<p>directions, no longer preserving the order of their natural courses,</p>
<p>but at war with themselves, because they receive no good from one</p>
<p>another, and are hostile to the abiding constitution of the body,</p>
<p>which they corrupt and dissolve. The oldest part of the flesh which is</p>
<p>corrupted, being hard to decompose, from long burning grows black, and</p>
<p>from being everywhere corroded becomes bitter, and is injurious to</p>
<p>every part of the body which is still uncorrupted. Sometimes, when the</p>
<p>bitter element is refined away, the black part assumes an acidity</p>
<p>which takes the place of the bitterness; at other times the bitterness</p>
<p>being tinged with blood has a redder colour; and this, when mixed with</p>
<p>black, takes the hue of grass; and again, an auburn colour mingles</p>
<p>with the bitter matter when new flesh is decomposed by the fire</p>
<p>which surrounds the internal flame-to all which symptoms some</p>
<p>physician perhaps, or rather some philosopher, who had the power of</p>
<p>seeing in many dissimilar things one nature deserving of a name, has</p>
<p>assigned the common name of bile. But the other kinds of bile are</p>
<p>variously distinguished by their colours. As for serum, that sort</p>
<p>which is the watery part of blood is innocent, but that which is a</p>
<p>secretion of black and acid bile is malignant when mingled by the</p>
<p>power of heat with any salt substance, and is then called acid phlegm.</p>
<p>Again, the substance which is formed by the liquefaction of new and</p>
<p>tender flesh when air is present, if inflated and encased in liquid so</p>
<p>as to form bubbles, which separately are invisible owing to their</p>
<p>small size, but when collected are of a bulk which is visible, and</p>
<p>have a white colour arising out of the generation of foam-all this</p>
<p>decomposition of tender flesh when inter-mingled with air is termed by</p>
<p>us white phlegm. And the whey or sediment of newly-formed phlegm is</p>
<p>sweat and tears, and includes the various daily discharges by which</p>
<p>the body is purified. Now all these become causes of disease when</p>
<p>the blood is not replenished in a natural manner by food and drink but</p>
<p>gains bulk from opposite sources in violation of the laws of nature.</p>
<p>When the several parts of the flesh are separated by disease, if the</p>
<p>foundation remains, the power of the disorder is only half as great,</p>
<p>and there is still a prospect of an easy recovery; but when that which</p>
<p>binds the flesh to the bones is diseased, and no longer being</p>
<p>separated from the muscles and sinews, ceases to give nourishment to</p>
<p>the bone and to unite flesh and bone, and from being oily and smooth</p>
<p>and glutinous becomes rough and salt and dry, owing to bad regimen,</p>
<p>then all the substance thus corrupted crumbles away under the flesh</p>
<p>and the sinews, and separates from the bone, and the fleshy parts fall</p>
<p>away from their foundation and leave the sinews bare and full of</p>
<p>brine, and the flesh again gets into the circulation of the blood</p>
<p>and makes the previously-mentioned disorders still greater. And if</p>
<p>these bodily affections be severe, still worse are the prior</p>
<p>disorders; as when the bone itself, by reason of the density of the</p>
<p>flesh, does not obtain sufficient air, but becomes mouldy and hot</p>
<p>and gangrened and receives no nutriment, and the natural process is</p>
<p>inverted, and the bone crumbling passes into the food, and the food</p>
<p>into the flesh, and the flesh again falling into the blood makes all</p>
<p>maladies that may occur more virulent than those already mentioned.</p>
<p>But the worst case of all is when the marrow is diseased, either</p>
<p>from excess or defect; and this is the cause of the very greatest</p>
<p>and most fatal disorders, in which the whole course of the body is</p>
<p>reversed.</p>
<p>There is a third class of diseases which may be conceived of as</p>
<p>arising in three ways; for they are produced sometimes by wind, and</p>
<p>sometimes by phlegm, and sometimes by bile. When the lung, which is</p>
<p>the dispenser of the air to the body, is obstructed by rheums and</p>
<p>its passages are not free, some of them not acting, while through</p>
<p>others too much air enters, then the parts which are unrefreshed by</p>
<p>air corrode, while in other parts the excess of air forcing its way</p>
<p>through the veins distorts them and decomposing the body is enclosed</p>
<p>in the midst of it and occupies the midriff thus numberless painful</p>
<p>diseases are produced, accompanied by copious sweats. And oftentimes</p>
<p>when the flesh is dissolved in the body, wind, generated within and</p>
<p>unable to escape, is the source of quite as much pain as the air</p>
<p>coming in from without; but the greatest pain is felt when the wind</p>
<p>gets about the sinews and the veins of the shoulders, and swells</p>
<p>them up, so twists back the great tendons and the sinews which are</p>
<p>connected with them. These disorders are called tetanus and</p>
<p>opisthotonus, by reason of the tension which accompanies them. The</p>
<p>cure of them is difficult; relief is in most cases given by fever</p>
<p>supervening. The white phlegm, though dangerous when detained within</p>
<p>by reason of the air-bubbles, yet if it can communicate with the</p>
<p>outside air, is less severe, and only discolours the body,</p>
<p>generating leprous eruptions and similar diseases. When it is</p>
<p>mingled with black bile and dispersed about the courses of the head,</p>
<p>which are the divinest part of us, the attack if coming on in sleep,</p>
<p>is not so severe; but when assailing those who are awake it is hard to</p>
<p>be got rid of, and being an affection of a sacred part, is most justly</p>
<p>called sacred. An acid and salt phlegm, again, is the source of all</p>
<p>those diseases which take the form of catarrh, but they have many</p>
<p>names because the places into which they flow are manifold.</p>
<p>Inflammations of the body come from burnings and inflamings, and all</p>
<p>of them originate in bile. When bile finds a means of discharge, it</p>
<p>boils up and sends forth all sorts of tumours; but when imprisoned</p>
<p>within, it generates many inflammatory diseases, above all when</p>
<p>mingled with pure blood; since it then displaces the fibres which</p>
<p>are scattered about in the blood and are designed to maintain the</p>
<p>balance of rare and dense, in order that the blood may not be so</p>
<p>liquefied by heat as to exude from the pores of the body, nor again</p>
<p>become too dense and thus find a difficulty in circulating through the</p>
<p>veins. The fibres are so constituted as to maintain this balance;</p>
<p>and if any one brings them all together when the blood is dead and</p>
<p>in process of cooling, then the blood which remains becomes fluid, but</p>
<p>if they are left alone, they soon congeal by reason of the surrounding</p>
<p>cold. The fibres having this power over the blood, bile, which is only</p>
<p>stale blood, and which from being flesh is dissolved again into blood,</p>
<p>at the first influx coming in little by little, hot and liquid, is</p>
<p>congealed by the power of the fibres; and so congealing and made to</p>
<p>cool, it produces internal cold and shuddering. When it enters with</p>
<p>more of a flood and overcomes the fibres by its heat, and boiling up</p>
<p>throws them into disorder, if it have power enough to maintain its</p>
<p>supremacy, it penetrates the marrow and burns up what may be termed</p>
<p>the cables of the soul, and sets her free; but when there is not so</p>
<p>much of it, and the body though wasted still holds out, the bile is</p>
<p>itself mastered, and is either utterly banished, or is thrust</p>
<p>through the veins into the lower or upper-belly, and is driven out</p>
<p>of the body like an exile from a state in which there has been civil</p>
<p>war; whence arise diarrhoeas and dysenteries, and all such</p>
<p>disorders. When the constitution is disordered by excess of fire,</p>
<p>continuous heat and fever are the result; when excess of air is the</p>
<p>cause, then the fever is quotidian; when of water, which is a more</p>
<p>sluggish element than either fire or air, then the fever is a tertian;</p>
<p>when of earth, which is the most sluggish of the four, and is only</p>
<p>purged away in a four-fold period, the result is a quartan fever,</p>
<p>which can with difficulty be shaken off.</p>
<p>Such is the manner in which diseases of the body arise; the</p>
<p>disorders of the soul, which depend upon the body, originate as</p>
<p>follows. We must acknowledge disease of the mind to be a want of</p>
<p>intelligence; and of this there are two kinds; to wit, madness and</p>
<p>ignorance. In whatever state a man experiences either of them, that</p>
<p>state may be called disease; and excessive pains and pleasures are</p>
<p>justly to be regarded as the greatest diseases to which the soul is</p>
<p>liable. For a man who is in great joy or in great pain, in his</p>
<p>unseasonable eagerness to attain the one and to avoid the other, is</p>
<p>not able to see or to hear anything rightly; but he is mad, and is</p>
<p>at the time utterly incapable of any participation in reason. He who</p>
<p>has the seed about the spinal marrow too plentiful and overflowing,</p>
<p>like a tree overladen with fruit, has many throes, and also obtains</p>
<p>many pleasures in his desires and their offspring, and is for the most</p>
<p>part of his life deranged, because his pleasures and pains are so very</p>
<p>great; his soul is rendered foolish and disordered by his body; yet he</p>
<p>is regarded not as one diseased, but as one who is voluntarily bad,</p>
<p>which is a mistake. The truth is that the intemperance of love is a</p>
<p>disease of the soul due chiefly to the moisture and fluidity which</p>
<p>is produced in one of the elements by the loose consistency of the</p>
<p>bones. And in general, all that which is termed the incontinence of</p>
<p>pleasure and is deemed a reproach under the idea that the wicked</p>
<p>voluntarily do wrong is not justly a matter for reproach. For no man</p>
<p>is voluntarily bad; but the bad become bad by reason of an ill</p>
<p>disposition of the body and bad education, things which are hateful to</p>
<p>every man and happen to him against his will. And in the case of</p>
<p>pain too in like manner the soul suffers much evil from the body.</p>
<p>For where the acid and briny phlegm and other bitter and bilious</p>
<p>humours wander about in the body, and find no exit or escape, but</p>
<p>are pent up within and mingle their own vapours with the motions of</p>
<p>the soul, and are blended, with them, they produce all sorts of</p>
<p>diseases, more or fewer, and in every degree of intensity; and being</p>
<p>carried to the three places of the soul, whichever they may</p>
<p>severally assail, they create infinite varieties of ill-temper and</p>
<p>melancholy, of rashness and cowardice, and also of forgetfulness and</p>
<p>stupidity. Further, when to this evil constitution of body evil</p>
<p>forms of government are added and evil discourses are uttered in</p>
<p>private as well as in public, and no sort of instruction is given in</p>
<p>youth to cure these evils, then all of us who are bad become bad</p>
<p>from two causes which are entirely beyond our control. In such cases</p>
<p>the planters are to blame rather than the plants, the educators rather</p>
<p>than the educated. But however that may be, we should endeavour as far</p>
<p>as we can by education, and studies, and learning, to avoid vice and</p>
<p>attain virtue; this, however, is part of another subject.</p>
<p>There is a corresponding enquiry concerning the mode of treatment by</p>
<p>which the mind and the body are to be preserved, about which it is</p>
<p>meet and right that I should say a word in turn; for it is more our</p>
<p>duty to speak of the good than of the evil. Everything that is good is</p>
<p>fair, and the animal fair is not without proportion, and the animal</p>
<p>which is to be fair must have due proportion. Now we perceive lesser</p>
<p>symmetries or proportions and reason about them, but of the highest</p>
<p>and greatest we take no heed; for there is no proportion or</p>
<p>disproportion more productive of health and disease, and virtue and</p>
<p>vice, than that between soul and body. This however we do not</p>
<p>perceive, nor do we reflect that when a weak or small frame is the</p>
<p>vehicle of a great and mighty soul, or conversely, when a little</p>
<p>soul is encased in a large body, then the whole animal is not fair,</p>
<p>for it lacks the most important of all symmetries; but the due</p>
<p>proportion of mind and body is the fairest and loveliest of all sights</p>
<p>to him who has the seeing eye. Just as a body which has a leg too</p>
<p>long, or which is unsymmetrical in some other respect, is an</p>
<p>unpleasant sight, and also, when doing its share of work, is much</p>
<p>distressed and makes convulsive efforts, and often stumbles through</p>
<p>awkwardness, and is the cause of infinite evil to its own self-in like</p>
<p>manner we should conceive of the double nature which we call the</p>
<p>living being; and when in this compound there is an impassioned soul</p>
<p>more powerful than the body, that soul, I say, convulses and fills</p>
<p>with disorders the whole inner nature of man; and when eager in the</p>
<p>pursuit of some sort of learning or study, causes wasting; or again,</p>
<p>when teaching or disputing in private or in public, and strifes and</p>
<p>controversies arise, inflames and dissolves the composite frame of man</p>
<p>and introduces rheums; and the nature of this phenomenon is not</p>
<p>understood by most professors of medicine, who ascribe it to the</p>
<p>opposite of the real cause. And once more, when body large and too</p>
<p>strong for the soul is united to a small and weak intelligence, then</p>
<p>inasmuch as there are two desires natural to man,-one of food for</p>
<p>the sake of the body, and one of wisdom for the sake of the diviner</p>
<p>part of us-then, I say, the motions of the stronger, getting the</p>
<p>better and increasing their own power, but making the soul dull, and</p>
<p>stupid, and forgetful, engender ignorance, which is the greatest of</p>
<p>diseases. There is one protection against both kinds of</p>
<p>disproportion:-that we should not move the body without the soul or</p>
<p>the soul without the body, and thus they will be on their guard</p>
<p>against each other, and be healthy and well balanced. And therefore</p>
<p>the mathematician or any one else whose thoughts are much absorbed</p>
<p>in some intellectual pursuit, must allow his body also to have due</p>
<p>exercise, and practise gymnastic; and he who is careful to fashion the</p>
<p>body, should in turn impart to the soul its proper motions, and should</p>
<p>cultivate music and all philosophy, if he would deserve to be called</p>
<p>truly fair and truly good. And the separate parts should be treated in</p>
<p>the same manner, in imitation of the pattern of the universe; for as</p>
<p>the body is heated and also cooled within by the elements which</p>
<p>enter into it, and is again dried up and moistened by external things,</p>
<p>and experiences these and the like affections from both kinds of</p>
<p>motions, the result is that the body if given up to motion when in a</p>
<p>state of quiescence is overmastered and perishes; but if any one, in</p>
<p>imitation of that which we call the foster-mother and nurse of the</p>
<p>universe, will not allow the body ever to be inactive, but is always</p>
<p>producing motions and agitations through its whole extent, which</p>
<p>form the natural defence against other motions both internal and</p>
<p>external, and by moderate exercise reduces to order according to their</p>
<p>affinities the particles and affections which are wandering about</p>
<p>the body, as we have already said when speaking of the universe, he</p>
<p>will not allow enemy placed by the side of enemy to stir up wars and</p>
<p>disorders in the body, but he will place friend by the side of friend,</p>
<p>so as to create health.</p>
<p>Now of all motions that is the best which is produced in a thing</p>
<p>by itself, for it is most akin to the motion of thought and of the</p>
<p>universe; but that motion which is caused by others is not so good,</p>
<p>and worst of all is that which moves the body, when at rest, in</p>
<p>parts only and by some external agency. Wherefore of all modes of</p>
<p>purifying and reuniting the body the best is gymnastic; the next</p>
<p>best is a surging motion, as in sailing or any other mode of</p>
<p>conveyance which is not fatiguing; the third sort of motion may be</p>
<p>of use in a case of extreme necessity, but in any other will be</p>
<p>adopted by no man of sense: I mean the purgative treatment of</p>
<p>physicians; for diseases unless they are very dangerous should not</p>
<p>be irritated by medicines, since every form of disease is in a</p>
<p>manner akin to the living being, whose complex frame has an</p>
<p>appointed term of life. For not the whole race only, but each</p>
<p>individual-barring inevitable accidents-comes into the world having</p>
<p>a fixed span, and the triangles in us are originally framed with power</p>
<p>to last for a certain time, beyond which no man prolong his life.</p>
<p>And this holds also of the constitution of diseases; if any one</p>
<p>regardless of the appointed time tries to subdue them by medicine,</p>
<p>he only aggravates and multiplies them. Wherefore we ought always to</p>
<p>manage them by regimen, as far as a man can spare the time, and not</p>
<p>provoke a disagreeable enemy by medicines.</p>
<p>Enough of the composite animal, and of the body which is a part of</p>
<p>him, and of the manner in which a man may train and be trained by</p>
<p>himself so as to live most according to reason: and we must above</p>
<p>and before all provide that the element which is to train him shall be</p>
<p>the fairest and best adapted to that purpose. A minute discussion of</p>
<p>this subject would be a serious task; but if, as before, I am to</p>
<p>give only an outline, the subject may not unfitly be summed up as</p>
<p>follows.</p>
<p>I have often remarked that there are three kinds of soul located</p>
<p>within us, having each of them motions, and I must now repeat in the</p>
<p>fewest words possible, that one part, if remaining inactive and</p>
<p>ceasing from its natural motion, must necessarily become very weak,</p>
<p>but that which is trained and exercised, very strong. Wherefore we</p>
<p>should take care that the movements of the different parts of the soul</p>
<p>should be in due proportion.</p>
<p>And we should consider that God gave the sovereign part of the human</p>
<p>soul to be the divinity of each one, being that part which, as we say,</p>
<p>dwells at the top of the body, inasmuch as we are a plant not of an</p>
<p>earthly but of a heavenly growth, raises us from earth to our</p>
<p>kindred who are in heaven. And in this we say truly; for the divine</p>
<p>power suspended the head and root of us from that place where the</p>
<p>generation of the soul first began, and thus made the whole body</p>
<p>upright. When a man is always occupied with the cravings of desire and</p>
<p>ambition, and is eagerly striving to satisfy them, all his thoughts</p>
<p>must be mortal, and, as far as it is possible altogether to become</p>
<p>such, he must be mortal every whit, because he has cherished his</p>
<p>mortal part. But he who has been earnest in the love of knowledge</p>
<p>and of true wisdom, and has exercised his intellect more than any</p>
<p>other part of him, must have thoughts immortal and divine, if he</p>
<p>attain truth, and in so far as human nature is capable of sharing in</p>
<p>immortality, he must altogether be immortal; and since he is ever</p>
<p>cherishing the divine power, and has the divinity within him in</p>
<p>perfect order, he will be perfectly happy. Now there is only one way</p>
<p>of taking care of things, and this is to give to each the food and</p>
<p>motion which are natural to it. And the motions which are naturally</p>
<p>akin to the divine principle within us are the thoughts and</p>
<p>revolutions of the universe. These each man should follow, and correct</p>
<p>the courses of the head which were corrupted at our birth, and by</p>
<p>learning the harmonies and revolutions of the universe, should</p>
<p>assimilate the thinking being to the thought, renewing his original</p>
<p>nature, and having assimilated them should attain to that perfect life</p>
<p>which the gods have set before mankind, both for the present and the</p>
<p>future.</p>
<p>Thus our original design of discoursing about the universe down to</p>
<p>the creation of man is nearly completed. A brief mention may be made</p>
<p>of the generation of other animals, so far as the subject admits of</p>
<p>brevity; in this manner our argument will best attain a due</p>
<p>proportion. On the subject of animals, then, the following remarks may</p>
<p>be offered. Of the men who came into the world, those who were cowards</p>
<p>or led unrighteous lives may with reason be supposed to have changed</p>
<p>into the nature of women in the second generation. And this was the</p>
<p>reason why at that time the gods created in us the desire of sexual</p>
<p>intercourse, contriving in man one animated substance, and in woman</p>
<p>another, which they formed respectively in the following manner. The</p>
<p>outlet for drink by which liquids pass through the lung under the</p>
<p>kidneys and into the bladder, which receives then by the pressure of</p>
<p>the air emits them, was so fashioned by them as to penetrate also into</p>
<p>the body of the marrow, which passes from the head along the neck</p>
<p>and through the back, and which in the preceding discourse we have</p>
<p>named the seed. And the seed having life, and becoming endowed with</p>
<p>respiration, produces in that part in which it respires a lively</p>
<p>desire of emission, and thus creates in us the love of procreation.</p>
<p>Wherefore also in men the organ of generation becoming rebellious</p>
<p>and masterful, like an animal disobedient to reason, and maddened with</p>
<p>the sting of lust, seeks to gain absolute sway; and the same is the</p>
<p>case with the so-called womb or matrix of women; the animal within</p>
<p>them is desirous of procreating children, and when remaining</p>
<p>unfruitful long beyond its proper time, gets discontented and angry,</p>
<p>and wandering in every direction through the body, closes up the</p>
<p>passages of the breath, and, by obstructing respiration, drives them</p>
<p>to extremity, causing all varieties of disease, until at length the</p>
<p>desire and love of the man and the woman, bringing them together and</p>
<p>as it were plucking the fruit from the tree, sow in the womb, as in</p>
<p>a field, animals unseen by reason of their smallness and without form;</p>
<p>these again are separated and matured within; they are then finally</p>
<p>brought out into the light, and thus the generation of animals is</p>
<p>completed.</p>
<p>Thus were created women and the female sex in general. But the</p>
<p>race of birds was created out of innocent light-minded men, who,</p>
<p>although their minds were directed toward heaven, imagined, in their</p>
<p>simplicity, that the clearest demonstration of the things above was to</p>
<p>be obtained by sight; these were remodelled and transformed into</p>
<p>birds, and they grew feathers instead of hair. The race of wild</p>
<p>pedestrian animals, again, came from those who had no philosophy in</p>
<p>any of their thoughts, and never considered at all about the nature of</p>
<p>the heavens, because they had ceased to use the courses of the head,</p>
<p>but followed the guidance of those parts of the soul which are in</p>
<p>the breast. In consequence of these habits of theirs they had their</p>
<p>front-legs and their heads resting upon the earth to which they were</p>
<p>drawn by natural affinity; and the crowns of their heads were</p>
<p>elongated and of all sorts of shapes, into which the courses of the</p>
<p>soul were crushed by reason of disuse. And this was the reason why</p>
<p>they were created quadrupeds and polypods: God gave the more senseless</p>
<p>of them the more support that they might be more attracted to the</p>
<p>earth. And the most foolish of them, who trail their bodies entirely</p>
<p>upon the ground and have no longer any need of feet, he made without</p>
<p>feet to crawl upon the earth. The fourth class were the inhabitants of</p>
<p>the water: these were made out of the most entirely senseless and</p>
<p>ignorant of all, whom the transformers did not think any longer worthy</p>
<p>of pure respiration, because they possessed a soul which was made</p>
<p>impure by all sorts of transgression; and instead of the subtle and</p>
<p>pure medium of air, they gave them the deep and muddy sea to be</p>
<p>their element of respiration; and hence arose the race of fishes and</p>
<p>oysters, and other aquatic animals, which have received the most</p>
<p>remote habitations as a punishment of their outlandish ignorance.</p>
<p>These are the laws by which animals pass into one another, now, as</p>
<p>ever, changing as they lose or gain wisdom and folly.</p>
<p>We may now say that our discourse about the nature of the universe</p>
<p>has an end. The world has received animals, mortal and immortal, and</p>
<p>is fulfilled with them, and has become a visible animal containing the</p>
<p>visible-the sensible God who is the image of the intellectual, the</p>
<p>greatest, best, fairest, most perfect-the one only begotten heaven.</p>
