<p>by Henry van Dyke</p>
<p>A WRITER&#x27;S REQUEST OF HIS MASTER</p>
<p>Let me never tag a moral to a story, nor tell a story without a</p>
<p>meaning.  Make me respect my material so much that I dare not slight</p>
<p>my work.  Help me to deal very honestly with words and with people</p>
<p>because they are both alive.  Show me that as in a river, so in a</p>
<p>writing, clearness is the best quality, and a little that is pure is</p>
<p>worth more than much that is mixed.  Teach me to see the local</p>
<p>colour without being blind to the inner light.  Give me an ideal</p>
<p>that will stand the strain of weaving into human stuff on the loom</p>
<p>of the real.  Keep me from caring more for books than for folks, for</p>
<p>art than for life.  Steady me to do my full stint of work as well as</p>
<p>I can: and when that is done, stop me, pay what wages Thou wilt, and</p>
<p>help me to say, from a quiet heart, a grateful AMEN.</p>
<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>In every life worth writing about there is a ruling passion,--&quot;the</p>
<p>very pulse of the machine.&quot;  Unless you touch that, you are groping</p>
<p>around outside of reality.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is romantic love: Natures masterpiece of interested</p>
<p>benevolence.  In almost all lives this passion has its season of</p>
<p>empire.  Therefore, and rightly, it is the favourite theme of the</p>
<p>storyteller.  Romantic love interests almost everybody, because</p>
<p>almost everybody knows something about it, or would like to know.</p>
<p>But there are other passions, no less real, which also have their</p>
<p>place and power in human life.  Some of them come earlier, and</p>
<p>sometimes they last longer, than romantic love.  They play alongside</p>
<p>of it and are mixed up with it, now checking it, now advancing its</p>
<p>flow and tingeing it with their own colour.</p>
<p>Just because love is so universal, it is often to one of the other</p>
<p>passions that we must look for the distinctive hue, the individual</p>
<p>quality of a life-story.  Granted, if you will, that everybody must</p>
<p>fall in love, or ought to fall in love, How will he do it?  And what</p>
<p>will he do afterwards?  These are questions not without interest to</p>
<p>one who watches the human drama as a friend.  The answers depend</p>
<p>upon those hidden and durable desires, affections, and impulses to</p>
<p>which men and women give themselves up for rule and guidance.</p>
<p>Music, nature, children, honour, strife, revenge, money, pride,</p>
<p>friendship, loyalty, duty,--to these objects and others like them</p>
<p>the secret power of personal passion often turns, and the life</p>
<p>unconsciously follows it, as the tides in the sea follow the moon in</p>
<p>the sky.</p>
<p>When circumstances cross the ruling passion, when rocks lie in the</p>
<p>way and winds are contrary, then things happen, characters emerge,</p>
<p>slight events are significant, mere adventures are transformed into</p>
<p>a real plot.  What care I how many &quot;hair-breadth &#x27;scapes&quot; and</p>
<p>&quot;moving accidents&quot; your hero may pass through, unless I know him for</p>
<p>a man?  He is but a puppet strung on wires.  His kisses are wooden</p>
<p>and his wounds bleed sawdust.  There is nothing about him to</p>
<p>remember except his name, and perhaps a bit of dialect.  Kill him or</p>
<p>crown him,--what difference does it make?</p>
<p>But go the other way about your work:</p>

<p>and now there is something to tell, with a meaning.</p>
<p>If you tell it at length, it is a novel,--a painting.  If you tell</p>
<p>it in brief, it is a short story,--an etching.  But the subject is</p>
<p>always the same: the unseen, mysterious, ruling passion weaving the</p>
<p>stuff of human nature into patterns wherein the soul is imaged and</p>
<p>revealed.</p>
<p>To tell about some of these ruling passions, simply, clearly, and</p>
<p>concretely, is what I want to do in this book.  The characters are</p>
<p>chosen, for the most part, among plain people, because their</p>
<p>feelings are expressed with fewer words and greater truth, not being</p>
<p>costumed for social effect.  The scene is laid on Nature&#x27;s stage</p>
<p>because I like to be out-of-doors, even when I am trying to think</p>
<p>and learning to write.</p>

<p>He entered the backwoods village of Bytown literally on the wings of</p>
<p>the wind.  It whirled him along like a big snowflake, and dropped</p>
<p>him at the door of Moody&#x27;s &quot;Sportsmen&#x27;s Retreat,&quot; as if he were a</p>
<p>New Year&#x27;s gift from the North Pole.  His coming seemed a mere</p>
<p>chance; but perhaps there was something more in it, after all.  At</p>
<p>all events, you shall hear, if you will, the time and the manner of</p>
<p>his arrival.</p>
<p>It was the last night of December, some thirty-five years ago.  All</p>
<p>the city sportsmen who had hunted the deer under Bill Moody&#x27;s</p>
<p>direction had long since retreated to their homes, leaving the</p>
<p>little settlement on the border of the Adirondack wilderness wholly</p>
<p>under the social direction of the natives.</p>
<p>The annual ball was in full swing in the dining-room of the hotel.</p>
<p>At one side of the room the tables and chairs were piled up, with</p>
<p>their legs projecting in the air like a thicket of very dead trees.</p>
<p>The huge stove in the southeast corner was blushing a rosy red</p>
<p>through its thin coat of whitewash, and exhaling a furious dry heat</p>
<p>flavoured with the smell of baked iron.  At the north end, however,</p>
<p>winter reigned; and there were tiny ridges of fine snow on the</p>
<p>floor, sifted in by the wind through the cracks in the window-</p>
<p>frames.</p>
<p>But the bouncing girls and the heavy-footed guides and lumbermen who</p>
<p>filled the ball-room did not appear to mind the heat or the cold.</p>
<p>They balanced and &quot;sashayed&quot; from the tropics to the arctic circle.</p>
<p>They swung at corners and made &quot;ladies&#x27; change&quot; all through the</p>
<p>temperate zone.  They stamped their feet and did double-shuffles</p>
<p>until the floor trembled beneath them.  The tin lamp-reflectors on</p>
<p>the walls rattled like castanets.</p>
<p>There was only one drawback to the hilarity of the occasion.  The</p>
<p>band, which was usually imported from Sandy River Forks for such</p>
<p>festivities,--a fiddle, a cornet, a flute, and an accordion,--had</p>
<p>not arrived.  There was a general idea that the mail-sleigh, in</p>
<p>which the musicians were to travel, had been delayed by the storm,</p>
<p>and might break its way through the snow-drifts and arrive at any</p>
<p>moment.  But Bill Moody, who was naturally of a pessimistic</p>
<p>temperament, had offered a different explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;I tell ye, old Baker&#x27;s got that blame&#x27; band down to his hotel at</p>
<p>the Falls now, makin&#x27; &#x27;em play fer his party.  Them music fellers is</p>
<p>onsartin; can&#x27;t trust &#x27;em to keep anythin&#x27; &#x27;cept the toon, and they</p>
<p>don&#x27;t alluz keep that.  Guess we might uz well shet up this ball, or</p>
<p>go to work playin&#x27; games.&quot;</p>
<p>At this proposal a thick gloom had fallen over the assembly; but it</p>
<p>had been dispersed by Serena Moody&#x27;s cheerful offer to have the</p>
<p>small melodion brought out of the parlour, and to play for dancing</p>
<p>as well as she could.  The company agreed that she was a smart girl,</p>
<p>and prepared to accept her performance with enthusiasm.  As the</p>
<p>dance went on, there were frequent comments of approval to encourage</p>
<p>her in the labour of love.</p>
<p>&quot;Sereny&#x27;s doin&#x27; splendid, ain&#x27;t she?&quot; said the other girls.</p>
<p>To which the men replied, &quot;You bet!  The playin&#x27; &#x27;s reel nice, and</p>
<p>good &#x27;nough fer anybody--outside o&#x27; city folks.&quot;</p>
<p>But Serena&#x27;s repertory was weak, though her spirit was willing.</p>
<p>There was an unspoken sentiment among the men that &quot;The Sweet By and</p>
<p>By&quot; was not quite the best tune in the world for a quadrille.  A</p>
<p>Sunday-school hymn, no matter how rapidly it was rendered, seemed to</p>
<p>fall short of the necessary vivacity for a polka.  Besides, the</p>
<p>wheezy little organ positively refused to go faster than a certain</p>
<p>gait.  Hose Ransom expressed the popular opinion of the instrument,</p>
<p>after a figure in which he and his partner had been half a bar ahead</p>
<p>of the music from start to finish, when he said:</p>
<p>&quot;By Jolly! that old maloney may be chock full o&#x27; relijun and po&#x27;try;</p>
<p>but it ain&#x27;t got no DANCE into it, no more &#x27;n a saw-mill.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the situation of affairs inside of Moody&#x27;s tavern on New</p>
<p>Year&#x27;s Eve.  But outside of the house the snow lay two feet deep on</p>
<p>the level, and shoulder-high in the drifts.  The sky was at last</p>
<p>swept clean of clouds.  The shivering stars and the shrunken moon</p>
<p>looked infinitely remote in the black vault of heaven.  The frozen</p>
<p>lake, on which the ice was three feet thick and solid as rock, was</p>
<p>like a vast, smooth bed, covered with a white counterpane.  The</p>
<p>cruel wind still poured out of the northwest, driving the dry snow</p>
<p>along with it like a mist of powdered diamonds.</p>
<p>Enveloped in this dazzling, pungent atmosphere, half blinded and</p>
<p>bewildered by it, buffeted and yet supported by the onrushing</p>
<p>torrent of air, a man on snow-shoes, with a light pack on his</p>
<p>shoulders, emerged from the shelter of the Three Sisters&#x27; Islands,</p>
<p>and staggered straight on, down the lake.  He passed the headland of</p>
<p>the bay where Moody&#x27;s tavern is ensconced, and probably would have</p>
<p>drifted on beyond it, to the marsh at the lower end of the lake, but</p>
<p>for the yellow glare of the ball-room windows and the sound of music</p>
<p>and dancing which came out to him suddenly through a lull in the</p>
<p>wind.</p>
<p>He turned to the right, climbed over the low wall of broken ice-</p>
<p>blocks that bordered the lake, and pushed up the gentle slope to the</p>
<p>open passageway by which the two parts of the rambling house were</p>
<p>joined together.  Crossing the porch with the last remnant of his</p>
<p>strength, he lifted his hand to knock, and fell heavily against the</p>
<p>side door.</p>
<p>The noise, heard through the confusion within, awakened curiosity</p>
<p>and conjecture.</p>
<p>Just as when a letter comes to a forest cabin, it is turned over and</p>
<p>over, and many guesses are made as to the handwriting and the</p>
<p>authorship before it occurs to any one to open it and see who sent</p>
<p>it, so was this rude knocking at the gate the occasion of argument</p>
<p>among the rustic revellers as to what it might portend.  Some</p>
<p>thought it was the arrival of the belated band.  Others supposed the</p>
<p>sound betokened a descent of the Corey clan from the Upper Lake, or</p>
<p>a change of heart on the part of old Dan Dunning, who had refused to</p>
<p>attend the ball because they would not allow him to call out the</p>
<p>figures.  The guesses were various; but no one thought of the</p>
<p>possible arrival of a stranger at such an hour on such a night,</p>
<p>until Serena suggested that it would he a good plan to open the</p>
<p>door.  Then the unbidden guest was discovered lying benumbed along</p>
<p>the threshold.</p>
<p>There was no want of knowledge as to what should be done with a</p>
<p>half-frozen man, and no lack of ready hands to do it.  They carried</p>
<p>him not to the warm stove, but into the semi-arctic region of the</p>
<p>parlour.  They rubbed his face and his hands vigorously with snow.</p>
<p>They gave him a drink of hot tea flavoured with whiskey--or perhaps</p>
<p>it was a drink of whiskey with a little hot tea in it--and then, as</p>
<p>his senses began to return to him, they rolled him in a blanket and</p>
<p>left him on a sofa to thaw out gradually, while they went on with</p>
<p>the dance.</p>
<p>Naturally, he was the favourite subject of conversation for the next</p>
<p>hour.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is he, anyhow?  I never seen &#x27;im before.  Where&#x27;d he come</p>
<p>from?&quot; asked the girls.</p>
<p>&quot;I dunno,&quot; said Bill Moody; &quot;he didn&#x27;t say much.  Talk seemed all</p>
<p>froze up.  Frenchy, &#x27;cordin&#x27; to what he did say.  Guess he must a</p>
<p>come from Canady, workin&#x27; on a lumber job up Raquette River way.</p>
<p>Got bounced out o&#x27; the camp, p&#x27;raps.  All them Frenchies is queer.&quot;</p>
<p>This summary of national character appeared to command general</p>
<p>assent.</p>
<p>&quot;Yaas,&quot; said Hose Ransom, &quot;did ye take note how he hung on to that</p>
<p>pack o&#x27; his&#x27;n all the time?  Wouldn&#x27;t let go on it.  Wonder what &#x27;t</p>
<p>wuz?  Seemed kinder holler &#x27;n light, fer all &#x27;twuz so big an&#x27;</p>
<p>wropped up in lots o&#x27; coverin&#x27;s.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s the use of wonderin&#x27;?&quot; said one of the younger boys; &quot;find</p>
<p>out later on.  Now&#x27;s the time fer dancin&#x27;.  Whoop &#x27;er up!&quot;</p>
<p>So the sound of revelry swept on again in full flood.  The men and</p>
<p>maids went careering up and down the room.  Serena&#x27;s willing fingers</p>
<p>laboured patiently over the yellow keys of the reluctant melodion.</p>
<p>But the ancient instrument was weakening under the strain; the</p>
<p>bellows creaked; the notes grew more and more asthmatic.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold the Fort&quot; was the tune, &quot;Money Musk&quot; was the dance; and it was</p>
<p>a preposterously bad fit.  The figure was tangled up like a fishing-</p>
<p>line after trolling all day without a swivel.  The dancers were</p>
<p>doing their best, determined to be happy, as cheerful as possible,</p>
<p>but all out of time.  The organ was whirring and gasping and</p>
<p>groaning for breath.</p>
<p>Suddenly a new music filled the room.</p>
<p>The right tune--the real old joyful &quot;Money Musk,&quot; played jubilantly,</p>
<p>triumphantly, irresistibly--on a fiddle!</p>
<p>The melodion gave one final gasp of surprise and was dumb.</p>
<p>Every one looked up.  There, in the parlour door, stood the</p>
<p>stranger, with his coat off, his violin hugged close under his chin,</p>
<p>his right arm making the bow fly over the strings, his black eyes</p>
<p>sparkling, and his stockinged feet marking time to the tune.</p>
<p>&quot;DANSEZ!  DANSEZ,&quot; he cried, &quot;EN AVANT!  Don&#x27; spik&#x27;.  Don&#x27; res&#x27;!</p>
<p>Ah&#x27;ll goin&#x27; play de feedle fo&#x27; yo&#x27; jess moch yo&#x27; lak&#x27;, eef yo&#x27;</p>
<p>h&#x27;only DANSE!&quot;</p>
<p>The music gushed from the bow like water from the rock when Moses</p>
<p>touched it.  Tune followed tune with endless fluency and variety--</p>
<p>polkas, galops, reels, jigs, quadrilles; fragments of airs from many</p>
<p>lands--&quot;The Fisher&#x27;s Hornpipe,&quot; &quot;Charlie is my Darling,&quot; &quot;Marianne</p>
<p>s&#x27;en va-t-au Moulin,&quot; &quot;Petit Jean,&quot; &quot;Jordan is a Hard Road to</p>
<p>Trabbel,&quot; woven together after the strangest fashion and set to the</p>
<p>liveliest cadence.</p>
<p>It was a magical performance.  No one could withstand it.  They all</p>
<p>danced together, like the leaves on the shivering poplars when the</p>
<p>wind blows through them.  The gentle Serena was swept away from her</p>
<p>stool at the organ as if she were a little canoe drawn into the</p>
<p>rapids, and Bill Moody stepped high and cut pigeon-wings that had</p>
<p>been forgotten for a generation.  It was long after midnight when</p>
<p>the dancers paused, breathless and exhausted.</p>
<p>&quot;Waal,&quot; said Hose Ransom, &quot;that&#x27;s jess the hightonedest music we</p>
<p>ever had to Bytown.  You &#x27;re a reel player, Frenchy, that&#x27;s what you</p>
<p>are.  What&#x27;s your name?  Where&#x27;d you come from?  Where you goin&#x27; to?</p>
<p>What brought you here, anyhow?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;MOI?&quot; said the fiddler, dropping his bow and taking a long breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Mah nem Jacques Tremblay.  Ah&#x27;ll ben come fraum Kebeck.  W&#x27;ere</p>
<p>goin&#x27;?  Ah donno.  Prob&#x27;ly Ah&#x27;ll stop dis place, eef yo&#x27; lak&#x27; dat</p>
<p>feedle so moch, hein?&quot;</p>
<p>His hand passed caressingly over the smooth brown wood of the</p>
<p>violin.  He drew it up close to his face again, as if he would have</p>
<p>kissed it, while his eyes wandered timidly around the circle of</p>
<p>listeners, and rested at last, with a question in them, on the face</p>
<p>of the hotel-keeper.  Moody was fairly warmed, for once, out of his</p>
<p>customary temper of mistrust and indecision.  He spoke up promptly.</p>
<p>&quot;You kin stop here jess long&#x27;s you like.  We don&#x27; care where you</p>
<p>come from, an&#x27; you need n&#x27;t to go no fu&#x27;ther, less you wanter.  But</p>
<p>we ain&#x27;t got no use for French names round here.  Guess we &#x27;ll call</p>
<p>him Fiddlin&#x27; Jack, hey, Sereny?  He kin do the chores in the day-</p>
<p>time, an&#x27; play the fiddle at night.&quot;</p>
<p>This was the way in which Bytown came to have a lover of music among</p>
<p>its permanent inhabitants.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Jacques dropped into his place and filled it as if it had been made</p>
<p>for him.  There was something in his disposition that seemed to fit</p>
<p>him for just the role that was vacant in the social drama of the</p>
<p>settlement.  It was not a serious, important, responsible part, like</p>
<p>that of a farmer, or a store-keeper, or a professional hunter.  It</p>
<p>was rather an addition to the regular programme of existence,</p>
<p>something unannounced and voluntary, and therefore not weighted with</p>
<p>too heavy responsibilities.  There was a touch of the transient and</p>
<p>uncertain about it.  He seemed like a perpetual visitor; and yet he</p>
<p>stayed on as steadily as a native, never showing, from the first,</p>
<p>the slightest wish or intention to leave the woodland village.</p>
<p>I do not mean that he was an idler.  Bytown had not yet arrived at</p>
<p>that stage of civilization in which an ornamental element is</p>
<p>supported at the public expense.</p>
<p>He worked for his living, and earned it.  He was full of a quick,</p>
<p>cheerful industry; and there was nothing that needed to be done</p>
<p>about Moody&#x27;s establishment, from the wood-pile to the ice-house, at</p>
<p>which he did not bear a hand willingly and well.</p>
<p>&quot;He kin work like a beaver,&quot; said Bill Moody, talking the stranger</p>
<p>over down at the post-office one day; &quot;but I don&#x27;t b&#x27;lieve he&#x27;s got</p>
<p>much ambition.  Jess does his work and takes his wages, and then</p>
<p>gits his fiddle out and plays.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell ye what,&quot; said Hose Ransom, who set up for the village</p>
<p>philosopher, &quot;he ain&#x27;t got no &#x27;magination.  That&#x27;s what makes men</p>
<p>slack.  He don&#x27;t know what it means to rise in the world; don&#x27;t care</p>
<p>fer anythin&#x27; ez much ez he does fer his music.  He&#x27;s jess like a</p>
<p>bird; let him have &#x27;nough to eat and a chance to sing, and he&#x27;s all</p>
<p>right.  What&#x27;s he &#x27;magine about a house of his own, and a barn, and</p>
<p>sich things?&quot;</p>
<p>Hosea&#x27;s illustration was suggested by his own experience.  He had</p>
<p>just put the profits of his last summer&#x27;s guiding into a new barn,</p>
<p>and his imagination was already at work planning an addition to his</p>
<p>house in the shape of a kitchen L.</p>
<p>But in spite of his tone of contempt, he had a kindly feeling for</p>
<p>the unambitious fiddler.  Indeed, this was the attitude of pretty</p>
<p>much every one in the community.  A few men of the rougher sort had</p>
<p>made fun of him at first, and there had been one or two attempts at</p>
<p>rude handling.  But Jacques was determined to take no offence; and</p>
<p>he was so good-humoured, so obliging, so pleasant in his way of</p>
<p>whistling and singing about his work, that all unfriendliness soon</p>
<p>died out.</p>
<p>He had literally played his way into the affections of the village.</p>
<p>The winter seemed to pass more swiftly and merrily than it had done</p>
<p>before the violin was there.  He was always ready to bring it out,</p>
<p>and draw all kinds of music from its strings, as long as any one</p>
<p>wanted to listen or to dance.</p>
<p>It made no difference whether there was a roomful of listeners, or</p>
<p>only a couple, Fiddlin&#x27; Jack was just as glad to play.  With a</p>
<p>little, quiet audience, he loved to try the quaint, plaintive airs</p>
<p>of the old French songs--&quot;A la Claire Fontaine,&quot; &quot;Un Canadien</p>
<p>Errant,&quot; and &quot;Isabeau s&#x27;y Promene&quot;--and bits of simple melody from</p>
<p>the great composers, and familiar Scotch and English ballads--things</p>
<p>that he had picked up heaven knows where, and into which he put a</p>
<p>world of meaning, sad and sweet.</p>
<p>He was at his best in this vein when he was alone with Serena in the</p>
<p>kitchen--she with a piece of sewing in her lap, sitting beside the</p>
<p>lamp; he in the corner by the stove, with the brown violin tucked</p>
<p>under his chin, wandering on from one air to another, and perfectly</p>
<p>content if she looked up now and then from her work and told him</p>
<p>that she liked the tune.</p>
<p>Serena was a pretty girl, with smooth, silky hair, end eyes of the</p>
<p>colour of the nodding harebells that blossom on the edge of the</p>
<p>woods.  She was slight and delicate.  The neighbours called her</p>
<p>sickly; and a great doctor from Philadelphia who had spent a summer</p>
<p>at Bytown had put his ear to her chest, and looked grave, and said</p>
<p>that she ought to winter in a mild climate.  That was before people</p>
<p>had discovered the Adirondacks as a sanitarium for consumptives.</p>
<p>But the inhabitants of Bytown were not in the way of paying much</p>
<p>attention to the theories of physicians in regard to climate.  They</p>
<p>held that if you were rugged, it was a great advantage, almost a</p>
<p>virtue; but if you were sickly, you just had to make the best of it,</p>
<p>and get along with the weather as well as you could.</p>
<p>So Serena stayed at home and adapted herself very cheerfully to the</p>
<p>situation.  She kept indoors in winter more than the other girls,</p>
<p>and had a quieter way about her; but you would never have called her</p>
<p>an invalid.  There was only a clearer blue in her eyes, and a</p>
<p>smoother lustre on her brown hair, and a brighter spot of red on her</p>
<p>cheek.  She was particularly fond of reading and of music.  It was</p>
<p>this that made her so glad of the arrival of the violin.  The</p>
<p>violin&#x27;s master knew it, and turned to her as a sympathetic soul.  I</p>
<p>think he liked her eyes too, and the soft tones of her voice.  He</p>
<p>was a sentimentalist, this little Canadian, for all he was so merry;</p>
<p>and love--but that comes later.</p>
<p>&quot;Where&#x27;d you get your fiddle, Jack?  said Serena, one night as they</p>
<p>sat together in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah&#x27;ll get heem in Kebeck,&quot; answered Jacques, passing his hand</p>
<p>lightly over the instrument, as he always did when any one spoke of</p>
<p>it.  &quot;Vair&#x27; nice VIOLON, hein?  W&#x27;at you t&#x27;ink?  Ma h&#x27;ole teacher,</p>
<p>to de College, he was gif&#x27; me dat VIOLON, w&#x27;en Ah was gone away to</p>
<p>de woods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I want to know!  Were you in the College?  What&#x27;d you go off to the</p>
<p>woods for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah&#x27;ll get tire&#x27; fraum dat teachin&#x27;--read, read, read, h&#x27;all taim&#x27;.</p>
<p>Ah&#x27;ll not lak&#x27; dat so moch.  Rader be out-door--run aroun&#x27;--paddle</p>
<p>de CANOT--go wid de boys in de woods--mek&#x27; dem dance at ma MUSIQUE.</p>
<p>A-a-ah!  Dat was fon!  P&#x27;raps you t&#x27;ink dat not good, hem?  You</p>
<p>t&#x27;ink Jacques one beeg fool, Ah suppose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dunno,&quot; said Serena, declining to commit herself, but pressing on</p>
<p>gently, as women do, to the point she had in view when she began the</p>
<p>talk.  &quot;Dunno&#x27;s you&#x27;re any more foolish than a man that keeps on</p>
<p>doin&#x27; what he don&#x27;t like.  But what made you come away from the boys</p>
<p>in the woods and travel down this way?&quot;</p>
<p>A shade passed over the face of Jacques.  He turned away from the</p>
<p>lamp and bent over the violin on his knees, fingering the strings</p>
<p>nervously.  Then he spoke, in a changed, shaken voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah&#x27;l tole you somet&#x27;ing, Ma&#x27;amselle Serene.  You ma frien&#x27;.  Don&#x27;</p>
<p>you h&#x27;ask me dat reason of it no more.  Dat&#x27;s somet&#x27;ing vair&#x27; bad,</p>
<p>bad, bad.  Ah can&#x27;t nevair tole dat--nevair.&quot;</p>
<p>There was something in the way he said it that gave a check to her</p>
<p>gentle curiosity and turned it into pity.  A man with a secret in</p>
<p>his life?  It was a new element in her experience; like a chapter in</p>
<p>a book.  She was lady enough at heart to respect his silence.  She</p>
<p>kept away from the forbidden ground.  But the knowledge that it was</p>
<p>there gave a new interest to Jacques and his music.  She embroidered</p>
<p>some strange romances around that secret while she sat in the</p>
<p>kitchen sewing.</p>
<p>Other people at Bytown were less forbearing.  They tried their best</p>
<p>to find out something about Fiddlin&#x27; Jack&#x27;s past, but he was not</p>
<p>communicative.  He talked about Canada.  All Canadians do.  But</p>
<p>about himself?  No.</p>
<p>If the questions became too pressing, he would try to play himself</p>
<p>away from his inquisitors with new tunes.  If that did not succeed,</p>
<p>he would take the violin under his arm and slip quickly out of the</p>
<p>room.  And if you had followed him at such a time, you would have</p>
<p>heard him drawing strange, melancholy music from the instrument,</p>
<p>sitting alone in the barn, or in the darkness of his own room in the</p>
<p>garret.</p>
<p>Once, and only once, he seemed to come near betraying himself.  This</p>
<p>was how it happened.</p>
<p>There was a party at Moody&#x27;s one night, and Bull Corey had come down</p>
<p>from the Upper Lake and filled himself up with whiskey.</p>
<p>Bull was an ugly-tempered fellow.  The more he drank, up to a</p>
<p>certain point, the steadier he got on his legs, and the more</p>
<p>necessary it seemed for him to fight somebody.  The tide of his</p>
<p>pugnacity that night took a straight set toward Fiddlin&#x27; Jack.</p>
<p>Bull began with musical criticisms.  The fiddling did not suit him</p>
<p>at all.  It was too quick, or else it was too slow.  He failed to</p>
<p>perceive how any one could tolerate such music even in the infernal</p>
<p>regions, and he expressed himself in plain words to that effect.  In</p>
<p>fact, he damned the performance without even the faintest praise.</p>
<p>But the majority of the audience gave him no support.  On the</p>
<p>contrary, they told him to shut up.  And Jack fiddled along</p>
<p>cheerfully.</p>
<p>Then Bull returned to the attack, after having fortified himself in</p>
<p>the bar-room.  And now he took national grounds.  The French were,</p>
<p>in his opinion, a most despicable race.  They were not a patch on</p>
<p>the noble American race.  They talked too much, and their language</p>
<p>was ridiculous.  They had a condemned, fool habit of taking off</p>
<p>their hats when they spoke to a lady.  They ate frogs.</p>
<p>Having delivered himself of these sentiments in a loud voice, much</p>
<p>to the interruption of the music, he marched over to the table on</p>
<p>which Fiddlin&#x27; Jack was sitting, and grabbed the violin from his</p>
<p>hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Gimme that dam&#x27; fiddle,&quot; he cried, &quot;till I see if there&#x27;s a frog in</p>
<p>it.&quot;</p>
<p>Jacques leaped from the table, transported with rage.  His face was</p>
<p>convulsed.  His eyes blazed.  He snatched a carving-knife from the</p>
<p>dresser behind him, and sprang at Corey.</p>
<p>&quot;TORT DIEU!&quot; he shrieked, &quot;MON VIOLON!  Ah&#x27;ll keel you, beast!&quot;</p>
<p>But he could not reach the enemy.  Bill Moody&#x27;s long arms were flung</p>
<p>around the struggling fiddler, and a pair of brawny guides had Corey</p>
<p>pinned by the elbows, hustling him backward.  Half a dozen men</p>
<p>thrust themselves between the would-be combatants.  There was a dead</p>
<p>silence, a scuffling of feet on the bare floor; then the danger was</p>
<p>past, and a tumult of talk burst forth.</p>
<p>But a strange alteration had passed over Jacques.  He trembled.  He</p>
<p>turned white.  Tears poured down his cheeks.  As Moody let him go,</p>
<p>he dropped on his knees, hid his face in his hands, and prayed in</p>
<p>his own tongue.</p>
<p>&quot;My God, it is here again!  Was it not enough that I must be tempted</p>
<p>once before?  Must I have the madness yet another time?  My God,</p>
<p>show the mercy toward me, for the Blessed Virgin&#x27;s sake.  I am a</p>
<p>sinner, but not the second time; for the love of Jesus, not the</p>
<p>second time!  Ave Maria, gratia plena, ora pro me!&quot;</p>
<p>The others did not understand what he was saying.  Indeed, they paid</p>
<p>little attention to him.  They saw he was frightened, and thought it</p>
<p>was with fear.  They were already discussing what ought to be done</p>
<p>about the fracas.</p>
<p>It was plain that Bull Corey, whose liquor had now taken effect</p>
<p>suddenly, and made him as limp as a strip of cedar bark, must be</p>
<p>thrown out of the door, and left to cool off on the beach.  But what</p>
<p>to do with Fiddlin&#x27; Jack for his attempt at knifing--a detested</p>
<p>crime?  He might have gone at Bull with a gun, or with a club, or</p>
<p>with a chair, or with any recognized weapon.  But with a carving-</p>
<p>knife!  That was a serious offence.  Arrest him, and send him to</p>
<p>jail at the Forks?  Take him out, and duck him in the lake?  Lick</p>
<p>him, and drive him out of the town?</p>
<p>There was a multitude of counsellors, but it was Hose Ransom who</p>
<p>settled the case.  He was a well-known fighting-man, and a respected</p>
<p>philosopher.  He swung his broad frame in front of the fiddler.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell ye what we&#x27;ll do.  Jess nothin&#x27;!  Ain&#x27;t Bull Corey the</p>
<p>blowin&#x27;est and the mos&#x27; trouble-us cuss &#x27;round these hull woods?</p>
<p>And would n&#x27;t it be a fust-rate thing ef some o&#x27; the wind was let</p>
<p>out &#x27;n him?&quot;</p>
<p>General assent greeted this pointed inquiry.</p>
<p>&quot;And wa&#x27;n&#x27;t Fiddlin&#x27; Jack peacerble &#x27;nough &#x27;s long &#x27;s he was let</p>
<p>alone?  What&#x27;s the matter with lettin&#x27; him alone now?&quot;</p>
<p>The argument seemed to carry weight.  Hose saw his advantage, and</p>
<p>clinched it.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t he given us a lot o&#x27; fun here this winter in a innercent kind</p>
<p>o&#x27; way, with his old fiddle?  I guess there ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; on airth</p>
<p>he loves better &#x27;n that holler piece o&#x27; wood, and the toons that&#x27;s</p>
<p>inside o&#x27; it.  It&#x27;s jess like a wife or a child to him.  Where&#x27;s</p>
<p>that fiddle, anyhow?&quot;</p>
<p>Some one had picked it deftly out of Corey&#x27;s hand during the</p>
<p>scuffle, and now passed it up to Hose.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, Frenchy, take yer long-necked, pot-bellied music-gourd.  And</p>
<p>I want you boys to understand, ef any one teches that fiddle ag&#x27;in,</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll knock hell out &#x27;n him.&quot;</p>
<p>So the recording angel dropped another tear upon the record of Hosea</p>
<p>Ransom, and the books were closed for the night.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>For some weeks after the incident of the violin and the carving-</p>
<p>knife, it looked as if a permanent cloud had settled upon the</p>
<p>spirits of Fiddlin&#x27; Jack.  He was sad and nervous; if any one</p>
<p>touched him, or even spoke to him suddenly, he would jump like a</p>
<p>deer.  He kept out of everybody&#x27;s way as much as possible, sat out</p>
<p>in the wood-shed when he was not at work, and could not be persuaded</p>
<p>to bring down his fiddle.  He seemed in a fair way to be transformed</p>
<p>into &quot;the melancholy Jaques.&quot;</p>
<p>It was Serena who broke the spell; and she did it in a woman&#x27;s way,</p>
<p>the simplest way in the world--by taking no notice of it.</p>
<p>&quot;Ain&#x27;t you goin&#x27; to play for me to-night?&quot; she asked one evening, as</p>
<p>Jacques passed through the kitchen.  Whereupon the evil spirit was</p>
<p>exorcised, and the violin came back again to its place in the life</p>
<p>of the house.</p>
<p>But there was less time for music now than there had been in the</p>
<p>winter.  As the snow vanished from the woods, and the frost leaked</p>
<p>out of the ground, and the ice on the lake was honeycombed, breaking</p>
<p>away from the shore, and finally going to pieces altogether in a</p>
<p>warm southeast storm, the Sportsmen&#x27;s Retreat began to prepare for</p>
<p>business.  There was a garden to be planted, and there were boats to</p>
<p>be painted.  The rotten old wharf in front of the house stood badly</p>
<p>in need of repairs.  The fiddler proved himself a Jack-of-all-trades</p>
<p>and master of more than one.</p>
<p>In the middle of May the anglers began to arrive at the Retreat--a</p>
<p>quiet, sociable, friendly set of men, most of whom were old-time</p>
<p>acquaintances, and familiar lovers of the woods.  They belonged to</p>
<p>the &quot;early Adirondack period,&quot; these disciples of Walton.  They were</p>
<p>not very rich, and they did not put on much style, but they</p>
<p>understood how to have a good time; and what they did not know about</p>
<p>fishing was not worth knowing.</p>
<p>Jacques fitted into their scheme of life as a well-made reel fits</p>
<p>the butt of a good rod.  He was a steady oarsman, a lucky fisherman,</p>
<p>with a real genius for the use of the landing-net, and a cheerful</p>
<p>companion, who did not insist upon giving his views about artificial</p>
<p>flies and advice about casting, on every occasion.  By the end of</p>
<p>June he found himself in steady employment as a guide.</p>
<p>He liked best to go with the anglers who were not too energetic, but</p>
<p>were satisfied to fish for a few hours in the morning and again at</p>
<p>sunset, after a long rest in the middle of the afternoon.  This was</p>
<p>just the time for the violin; and if Jacques had his way, he would</p>
<p>take it with him, carefully tucked away in its case in the bow of</p>
<p>the boat; and when the pipes were lit after lunch, on the shore of</p>
<p>Round Island or at the mouth of Cold Brook, he would discourse sweet</p>
<p>music until the declining sun drew near the tree-tops and the veery</p>
<p>rang his silver bell for vespers.  Then it was time to fish again,</p>
<p>and the flies danced merrily over the water, and the great speckled</p>
<p>trout leaped eagerly to catch them.  For trolling all day long for</p>
<p>lake-trout Jacques had little liking.</p>
<p>&quot;Dat is not de sport,&quot; he would say, &quot;to hol&#x27; one r-r-ope in de</p>
<p>&#x27;and, an&#x27; den pool heem in wid one feesh on t&#x27;ree hook, h&#x27;all tangle</p>
<p>h&#x27;up in hees mout&#x27;--dat is not de sport.  Bisside, dat leef not</p>
<p>taim&#x27; for la musique.&quot;</p>
<p>Midsummer brought a new set of guests to the Retreat, and filled the</p>
<p>ramshackle old house to overflowing.  The fishing fell off, but</p>
<p>there were picnics and camping-parties in abundance, and Jacques was</p>
<p>in demand.  The ladies liked him; his manners were so pleasant, and</p>
<p>they took a great interest in his music.  Moody bought a piano for</p>
<p>the parlour that summer; and there were two or three good players in</p>
<p>the house, to whom Jacques would listen with delight, sitting on a</p>
<p>pile of logs outside the parlour windows in the warm August</p>
<p>evenings.</p>
<p>Some one asked him whether he did not prefer the piano to the</p>
<p>violin.</p>
<p>&quot;NON,&quot; he answered, very decidedly; &quot;dat piano, he vairee smart; he</p>
<p>got plentee word, lak&#x27; de leetle yellow bird in de cage--&#x27;ow you</p>
<p>call heem--de cannarie.  He spik&#x27; moch.  Bot dat violon, he spik&#x27;</p>
<p>more deep, to de heart, lak&#x27; de Rossignol.  He mak&#x27; me feel more</p>
<p>glad, more sorree--dat fo&#x27; w&#x27;at Ah lak&#x27; heem de bes&#x27;!&quot;</p>
<p>Through all the occupations and pleasures of the summer Jacques kept</p>
<p>as near as he could to Serena.  If he learned a new tune, by</p>
<p>listening to the piano--some simple, artful air of Mozart, some</p>
<p>melancholy echo of a nocturne of Chopin, some tender, passionate</p>
<p>love-song of Schubert--it was to her that he would play it first.</p>
<p>If he could persuade her to a boat-ride with him on the lake, Sunday</p>
<p>evening, the week was complete.  He even learned to know the more</p>
<p>shy and delicate forest-blossoms that she preferred, and would come</p>
<p>in from a day&#x27;s guiding with a tiny bunch of belated twin-flowers,</p>
<p>or a few purple-fringed orchids, or a handful of nodding stalks of</p>
<p>the fragrant pyrola, for her.</p>
<p>So the summer passed, and the autumn, with its longer hunting</p>
<p>expeditions into the depth of the wilderness; and by the time winter</p>
<p>came around again, Fiddlin&#x27; Jack was well settled at Moody&#x27;s as a</p>
<p>regular Adirondack guide of the old-fashioned type, but with a</p>
<p>difference.  He improved in his English.  Something of that missing</p>
<p>quality which Moody called ambition, and to which Hose Ransom gave</p>
<p>the name of imagination, seemed to awaken within him.  He saved his</p>
<p>wages.  He went into business for himself in a modest way, and made</p>
<p>a good turn in the manufacture of deerskin mittens and snow-shoes.</p>
<p>By the spring he had nearly three hundred dollars laid by, and</p>
<p>bought a piece of land from Ransom on the bank of the river just</p>
<p>above the village.</p>
<p>The second summer of guiding brought him in enough to commence</p>
<p>building a little house.  It was of logs, neatly squared at the</p>
<p>corners; and there was a door exactly in the middle of the facade,</p>
<p>with a square window at either side, and another at each end of the</p>
<p>house, according to the common style of architecture at Bytown.</p>
<p>But it was in the roof that the touch of distinction appeared.  For</p>
<p>this, Jacques had modelled after his memory of an old Canadian roof.</p>
<p>There was a delicate concave sweep in it, as it sloped downward from</p>
<p>the peak, and the eaves projected pleasantly over the front door,</p>
<p>making a strip of shade wherein it would be good to rest when the</p>
<p>afternoon sun shone hot.</p>
<p>He took great pride in this effort of the builder&#x27;s art.  One day at</p>
<p>the beginning of May, when the house was nearly finished, he asked</p>
<p>old Moody and Serena to stop on their way home from the village and</p>
<p>see what he had done.  He showed them the kitchen, and the living-</p>
<p>room, with the bed-room partitioned off from it, and sharing half of</p>
<p>its side window.  Here was a place where a door could be cut at the</p>
<p>back, and a shed built for a summer kitchen--for the coolness, you</p>
<p>understand.  And here were two stoves--one for the cooking, and the</p>
<p>other in the living-room for the warming, both of the newest.</p>
<p>&quot;An&#x27; look dat roof.  Dat&#x27;s lak&#x27; we make dem in Canada.  De rain ron</p>
<p>off easy, and de sun not shine too strong at de door.  Ain&#x27;t dat</p>
<p>nice?  You lak&#x27; dat roof, Ma&#x27;amselle Serene, hein?&quot;</p>
<p>Thus the imagination of Jacques unfolded itself, and his ambition</p>
<p>appeared to be making plans for its accomplishment.  I do not want</p>
<p>any one to suppose that there was a crisis in his affair of the</p>
<p>heart.  There was none.  Indeed, it is very doubtful whether anybody</p>
<p>in the village, even Serena herself, ever dreamed that there was</p>
<p>such an affair.  Up to the point when the house was finished and</p>
<p>furnished, it was to be a secret between Jacques and his violin; and</p>
<p>they found no difficulty in keeping it.</p>
<p>Bytown was a Yankee village. Jacques was, after all, nothing but a</p>
<p>Frenchman.  The native tone of religion, what there was of it, was</p>
<p>strongly Methodist.  Jacques never went to church, and if he was</p>
<p>anything, was probably a Roman Catholic.  Serena was something of a</p>
<p>sentimentalist, and a great reader of novels; but the international</p>
<p>love-story had not yet been invented, and the idea of getting</p>
<p>married to a foreigner never entered her head.  I do not say that</p>
<p>she suspected nothing in the wild flowers, and the Sunday evening</p>
<p>boat-rides, and the music.  She was a woman.  I have said already</p>
<p>that she liked Jacques very much, and his violin pleased her to the</p>
<p>heart.  But the new building by the river?  I am sure she never even</p>
<p>thought of it once, in the way that he did.</p>
<p>Well, in the end of June, just after the furniture had come for the</p>
<p>house with the curved roof, Serena was married to Hose Ransom.  He</p>
<p>was a young widower without children, and altogether the best</p>
<p>fellow, as well as the most prosperous, in the settlement.  His</p>
<p>house stood up on the hill, across the road from the lot which</p>
<p>Jacques had bought.  It was painted white, and it had a narrow front</p>
<p>porch, with a scroll-saw fringe around the edge of it; and there was</p>
<p>a little garden fenced in with white palings, in which Sweet</p>
<p>Williams and pansies and blue lupines and pink bleeding-hearts were</p>
<p>planted.</p>
<p>The wedding was at the Sportsmen&#x27;s Retreat, and Jacques was there,</p>
<p>of course.  There was nothing of the disconsolate lover about him.</p>
<p>The noun he might have confessed to, in a confidential moment of</p>
<p>intercourse with his violin; but the adjective was not in his line.</p>
<p>The strongest impulse in his nature was to be a giver of</p>
<p>entertaininent, a source of joy in others, a recognized element of</p>
<p>delight in the little world where he moved.  He had the artistic</p>
<p>temperament in its most primitive and naive form.  Nothing pleased</p>
<p>him so much as the act of pleasing.  Music was the means which</p>
<p>Nature had given him to fulfil this desire.  He played, as you might</p>
<p>say, out of a certain kind of selfishness, because he enjoyed making</p>
<p>other people happy.  He was selfish enough, in his way, to want the</p>
<p>pleasure of making everybody feel the same delight that he felt in</p>
<p>the clear tones, the merry cadences, the tender and caressing flow</p>
<p>of his violin.  That was consolation.  That was power.  That was</p>
<p>success.</p>
<p>And especially was he selfish enough to want to feel his ability to</p>
<p>give Serena a pleasure at her wedding--a pleasure that nobody else</p>
<p>could give her.  When she asked him to play, he consented gladly.</p>
<p>Never had he drawn the bow across the strings with a more magical</p>
<p>touch.  The wedding guests danced as if they were enchanted.  The</p>
<p>big bridegroom came up and clapped him on the back, with the nearest</p>
<p>approach to a gesture of affection that backwoods etiquette allows</p>
<p>between men.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack, you&#x27;re the boss fiddler o&#x27; this hull county.  Have a drink</p>
<p>now?  I guess you &#x27;re mighty dry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;MERCI, NON,&quot; said Jacques.  &quot;I drink only de museek dis night.  Eef</p>
<p>I drink two t&#x27;ings, I get dronk.&quot;</p>
<p>In between the dances, and while the supper was going on, he played</p>
<p>quieter tunes--ballads and songs that he knew Serena liked.  After</p>
<p>supper came the final reel; and when that was wound up, with immense</p>
<p>hilarity, the company ran out to the side door of the tavern to</p>
<p>shout a noisy farewell to the bridal buggy, as it drove down the</p>
<p>road toward the house with the white palings.  When they came back,</p>
<p>the fiddler was gone.  He had slipped away to the little cabin with</p>
<p>the curved roof.</p>
<p>All night long he sat there playing in the dark.  Every tune that he</p>
<p>had ever known came back to him--grave and merry, light and sad.  He</p>
<p>played them over and over again, passing round and round among them</p>
<p>as a leaf on a stream follows the eddies, now backward, now forward,</p>
<p>and returning most frequently to an echo of a certain theme from</p>
<p>Chopin--you remember the NOCTURNE IN G MINOR, the second one?  He</p>
<p>did not know who Chopin was.  Perhaps he did not even know the name</p>
<p>of the music.  But the air had fallen upon his ear somewhere, and</p>
<p>had stayed in his memory; and now it seemed to say something to him</p>
<p>that had an especial meaning.</p>
<p>At last he let the bow fall.  He patted the brown wood of the violin</p>
<p>after his old fashion, loosened the strings a little, wrapped it in</p>
<p>its green baize cover, and hung it on the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;Hang thou there, thou little violin,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;It is now that</p>
<p>I shall take the good care of thee, as never before; for thou art</p>
<p>the wife of Jacques Tremblay.  And the wife of &#x27;Osee Ransom, she is</p>
<p>a friend to us, both of us; and we will make the music for her many</p>
<p>years, I tell thee, many years--for her, and for her good man, and</p>
<p>for the children--yes?&quot;</p>
<p>But Serena did not have many years to listen to the playing of</p>
<p>Jacques Tremblay: on the white porch, in the summer evenings, with</p>
<p>bleeding-hearts abloom in the garden; or by the winter fire, while</p>
<p>the pale blue moonlight lay on the snow without, and the yellow</p>
<p>lamplight filled the room with homely radiance.  In the fourth year</p>
<p>after her marriage she died, and Jacques stood beside Hose at the</p>
<p>funeral.</p>
<p>There was a child--a little boy--delicate and blue-eyed, the living</p>
<p>image of his mother.  Jacques appointed himself general attendant,</p>
<p>nurse in extraordinary, and court musician to this child.  He gave</p>
<p>up his work as a guide.  It took him too much away from home.  He</p>
<p>was tired of it.  Besides, what did he want of so much money?  He</p>
<p>had his house.  He could gain enough for all his needs by making</p>
<p>snow-shoes and the deerskin mittens at home.  Then he could be near</p>
<p>little Billy.  It was pleasanter so.</p>
<p>When Hose was away on a long trip in the woods, Jacques would move</p>
<p>up to the white house and stay on guard.  His fiddle learned how to</p>
<p>sing the prettiest slumber songs.  Moreover, it could crow in the</p>
<p>morning, just like the cock; and it could make a noise like a mouse,</p>
<p>and like the cat, too; and there were more tunes inside of it than</p>
<p>in any music-box in the world.</p>
<p>As the boy grew older, the little cabin with the curved roof became</p>
<p>his favourite playground.  It was near the river, and Fiddlin&#x27; Jack</p>
<p>was always ready to make a boat for him, or help him catch minnows</p>
<p>in the mill-dam.  The child had a taste for music, too, and learned</p>
<p>some of the old Canadian songs, which he sang in a curious broken</p>
<p>patois, while his delighted teacher accompanied him on the violin.</p>
<p>But it was a great day when he was eight years old, and Jacques</p>
<p>brought out a small fiddle, for which he had secretly sent to</p>
<p>Albany, and presented it to the boy.</p>
<p>&quot;You see dat feedle, Billee?  Dat&#x27;s for you!  You mek&#x27; your lesson</p>
<p>on dat.  When you kin mek&#x27; de museek, den you play on de violon--</p>
<p>lak&#x27; dis one--listen!&quot;</p>
<p>Then he drew the bow across the strings and dashed into a medley of</p>
<p>the jolliest airs imaginable.</p>
<p>The boy took to his instruction as kindly as could have been</p>
<p>expected.  School interrupted it a good deal; and play with the</p>
<p>other boys carried him away often; but, after all, there was nothing</p>
<p>that he liked much better than to sit in the little cabin on a</p>
<p>winter evening and pick out a simple tune after his teacher.  He</p>
<p>must have had some talent for it, too; for Jacques was very proud of</p>
<p>his pupil, and prophesied great things of him.</p>
<p>&quot;You know dat little Billee of &#x27;Ose Ransom,&quot; the fiddler would say</p>
<p>to a circle of people at the hotel, where he still went to play for</p>
<p>parties; &quot;you know dat small Ransom boy?  Well, I &#x27;m tichin&#x27; heem</p>
<p>play de feedle; an&#x27; I tell you, one day he play better dan hees</p>
<p>ticher.  Ah, dat &#x27;s gr-r-reat t&#x27;ing, de museek, ain&#x27;t it?  Mek&#x27; you</p>
<p>laugh, mek&#x27; you cry, mek&#x27; you dance!  Now, you dance.  Tek&#x27; your</p>
<p>pardnerre.  EN AVANT! Kip&#x27; step to de museek!&quot;</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Thirty years brought many changes to Bytown. The wild woodland</p>
<p>flavour evaporated out of the place almost entirely; and instead of</p>
<p>an independent centre of rustic life, it became an annex to great</p>
<p>cities.  It was exploited as a summer resort, and discovered as a</p>
<p>winter resort.  Three or four big hotels were planted there, and in</p>
<p>their shadow a score of boarding-houses alternately languished and</p>
<p>flourished.  The summer cottage also appeared and multiplied; and</p>
<p>with it came many of the peculiar features which man elaborates in</p>
<p>his struggle toward the finest civilization--afternoon teas, and</p>
<p>amateur theatricals, and claw-hammer coats, and a casino, and even a</p>
<p>few servants in livery.</p>
<p>The very name of Bytown was discarded as being too American and</p>
<p>commonplace.  An Indian name was discovered, and considered much</p>
<p>more romantic and appropriate.  You will look in vain for Bytown on</p>
<p>the map now.  Nor will you find the old saw-mill there any longer,</p>
<p>wasting a vast water-power to turn its dripping wheel and cut up a</p>
<p>few pine-logs into fragrant boards.  There is a big steam-mill a</p>
<p>little farther up the river, which rips out thousands of feet of</p>
<p>lumber in a day; but there are no more pine-logs, only sticks of</p>
<p>spruce which the old lumbermen would have thought hardly worth</p>
<p>cutting.  And down below the dam there is a pulp-mill, to chew up</p>
<p>the little trees and turn them into paper, and a chair factory, and</p>
<p>two or three industrial establishments, with quite a little colony</p>
<p>of French-Canadians employed in them as workmen.</p>
<p>Hose Ransom sold his place on the hill to one of the hotel</p>
<p>companies, and a huge caravansary occupied the site of the house</p>
<p>with the white palings.  There were no more bleeding-hearts in the</p>
<p>garden.  There were beds of flaring red geraniums, which looked as</p>
<p>if they were painted; and across the circle of smooth lawn in front</p>
<p>of the piazza the name of the hotel was printed in alleged</p>
<p>ornamental plants letters two feet long, immensely ugly.  Hose had</p>
<p>been elevated to the office of postmaster, and lived in a Queen</p>
<p>Antic cottage on the main street.  Little Billy Ransom had grown up</p>
<p>into a very interesting young man, with a decided musical genius,</p>
<p>and a tenor voice, which being discovered by an enterprising patron</p>
<p>of genius, from Boston, Billy was sent away to Paris to learn to</p>
<p>sing.  Some day you will hear of his debut in grand opera, as</p>
<p>Monsieur Guillaume Rancon.</p>
<p>But Fiddlin&#x27; Jack lived on in the little house with the curved roof,</p>
<p>beside the river, refusing all the good offers which were made to</p>
<p>him for his piece of land.</p>
<p>&quot;NON,&quot; he said; &quot;what for shall I sell dis house?  I lak&#x27; her, she</p>
<p>lak&#x27; me.  All dese walls got full from museek, jus&#x27; lak&#x27; de wood of</p>
<p>dis violon.  He play bettair dan de new feedle, becos&#x27; I play heem</p>
<p>so long.  I lak&#x27; to lissen to dat rivaire in de night.  She sing</p>
<p>from long taim&#x27; ago--jus&#x27; de same song w&#x27;en I firs come here.  W&#x27;at</p>
<p>for I go away?  W&#x27;at I get?  W&#x27;at you can gif&#x27; me lak&#x27; dat?&quot;</p>
<p>He was still the favourite musician of the county-side, in great</p>
<p>request at parties and weddings; but he had extended the sphere of</p>
<p>his influence a little.  He was not willing to go to church, though</p>
<p>there were now several to choose from; but a young minister of</p>
<p>liberal views who had come to take charge of the new Episcopal</p>
<p>chapel had persuaded Jacques into the Sunday-school, to lead the</p>
<p>children&#x27;s singing with his violin.  He did it so well that the</p>
<p>school became the most popular in the village.  It was much</p>
<p>pleasanter to sing than to listen to long addresses.</p>
<p>Jacques grew old gracefully, but he certainly grew old rapidly.  His</p>
<p>beard was white; his shoulders were stooping; he suffered a good</p>
<p>deal in damp days from rheumatism--fortunately not in his hands, but</p>
<p>in his legs.  One spring there was a long spell of abominable</p>
<p>weather, just between freezing and thawing.  He caught a heavy cold</p>
<p>and took to his bed.  Hose came over to look after him.</p>
<p>For a few days the old fiddler kept up his courage, and would sit up</p>
<p>in the bed trying to play; then his strength and his spirit seemed</p>
<p>to fail together.  He grew silent and indifferent.  When Hose came</p>
<p>in he would find Jacques with his face turned to the wall, where</p>
<p>there was a tiny brass crucifix hanging below the violin, and his</p>
<p>lips moving quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t ye want the fiddle, Jack?  I &#x27;d like ter hear some o&#x27; them</p>
<p>old-time tunes ag&#x27;in.&quot;</p>
<p>But the artifice failed.  Jacques shook his head.  His mind seemed</p>
<p>to turn back to the time of his first arrival in the village, and</p>
<p>beyond it.  When he spoke at all, it was of something connected with</p>
<p>this early time.</p>
<p>&quot;Dat was bad taim&#x27; when I near keel Bull Corey, hein?&quot;</p>
<p>Hose nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;Dat was beeg storm, dat night when I come to Bytown.  You remember</p>
<p>dat?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, Hose remembered it very well.  It was a real old-fashioned</p>
<p>storm.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, but befo dose taim&#x27;, dere was wuss taim&#x27; dan dat--in Canada.</p>
<p>Nobody don&#x27; know &#x27;bout dat.  I lak to tell you, &#x27;Ose, but I can&#x27;t.</p>
<p>No, it is not possible to tell dat, nevair!&quot;</p>
<p>It came into Hose&#x27;s mind that the case was serious.  Jack was going</p>
<p>to die.  He never went to church, but perhaps the Sunday-school</p>
<p>might count for something.  He was only a Frenchman, after all, and</p>
<p>Frenchmen had their own ways of doing things.  He certainly ought to</p>
<p>see some kind of a preacher before he went out of the wilderness.</p>
<p>There was a Canadian priest in town that week, who had come down to</p>
<p>see about getting up a church for the French people who worked in</p>
<p>the mills.  Perhaps Jack would like to talk with him.</p>
<p>His face lighted up at the proposal.  He asked to have the room</p>
<p>tidied up, and a clean shirt put on him, and the violin laid open in</p>
<p>its case on a table beside the bed, and a few other preparations</p>
<p>made for the visit.  Then the visitor came, a tall, friendly, quiet-</p>
<p>looking man about Jacques&#x27;s age, with a smooth face and a long black</p>
<p>cassock.  The door was shut, and they were left alone together.</p>
<p>&quot;I am comforted that you are come, mon pere,&quot; said the sick man,</p>
<p>&quot;for I have the heavy heart.  There is a secret that I have kept for</p>
<p>many years.  Sometimes I had almost forgotten that it must be told</p>
<p>at the last; but now it is the time to speak.  I have a sin to</p>
<p>confess--a sin of the most grievous, of the most unpardonable.&quot;</p>
<p>The listener soothed him with gracious words; spoke of the mercy</p>
<p>that waits for all the penitent; urged him to open his heart without</p>
<p>delay.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, mon pere, it is this that makes me fear to die.  Long</p>
<p>since, in Canada, before I came to this place, I have killed a man.</p>
<p>It was--&quot;</p>
<p>The voice stopped.  The little round clock on the window-sill ticked</p>
<p>very distinctly and rapidly, as if it were in a hurry.</p>
<p>&quot;I will speak as short as I can.  It was in the camp of &#x27;Poleon</p>
<p>Gautier, on the river St. Maurice.  The big Baptiste Lacombe, that</p>
<p>crazy boy who wants always to fight, he mocks me when I play, he</p>
<p>snatches my violin, he goes to break him on the stove.  There is a</p>
<p>knife in my belt.  I spring to Baptiste.  I see no more what it is</p>
<p>that I do.  I cut him in the neck--once, twice.  The blood flies</p>
<p>out.  He falls down.  He cries, &#x27;I die.&#x27;  I grab my violin from the</p>
<p>floor, quick; then I run to the woods.  No one can catch me.  A</p>
<p>blanket, the axe, some food, I get from a hiding-place down the</p>
<p>river.  Then I travel, travel, travel through the woods, how many</p>
<p>days I know not, till I come here.  No one knows me.  I give myself</p>
<p>the name Tremblay.  I make the music for them.  With my violin I</p>
<p>live.  I am happy.  I forget.  But it all returns to me--now--at the</p>
<p>last.  I have murdered.  Is there a forgiveness for me, mon pere?&quot;</p>
<p>The priest&#x27;s face had changed very swiftly at the mention of the</p>
<p>camp on the St. Maurice.  As the story went on, he grew strangely</p>
<p>excited.  His lips twitched.  His hands trembled.  At the end he</p>
<p>sank on his knees, close by the bed, and looked into the countenance</p>
<p>of the sick man, searching it as a forester searches in the undergrowth</p>
<p>for a lost trail.  Then his eyes lighted up as he found it.</p>
<p>&quot;My son,&quot; said he, clasping the old fiddler&#x27;s hand in his own, &quot;you</p>
<p>are Jacques Dellaire.  And I--do you know me now?--I am Baptiste</p>
<p>Lacombe.  See those two scars upon my neck.  But it was not death.</p>
<p>You have not murdered.  You have given the stroke that changed my</p>
<p>heart.  Your sin is forgiven--AND MINE ALSO--by the mercy of God!&quot;</p>
<p>The round clock ticked louder and louder.  A level ray from the</p>
<p>setting sun--red gold--came in through the dusty window, and lay</p>
<p>across the clasped hands on the bed.  A white-throated sparrow, the</p>
<p>first of the season, on his way to the woods beyond the St.</p>
<p>Lawrence, whistled so clearly and tenderly that it seemed as if he</p>
<p>were repeating to these two gray-haired exiles the name of their</p>
<p>homeland.  &quot;sweet--sweet--Canada, Canada, Canada!&quot;  But there was a</p>
<p>sweeter sound than that in the quiet room.</p>
<p>It was the sound of the prayer which begins, in every language</p>
<p>spoken by men, with the name of that Unseen One who rules over</p>
<p>life&#x27;s chances, and pities its discords, and tunes it back again</p>
<p>into harmony.  Yes, this prayer of the little children who are only</p>
<p>learning how to play the first notes of life&#x27;s music, turns to the</p>
<p>great Master musician who knows it all and who loves to bring a</p>
<p>melody out of every instrument that He has made; and it seems to lay</p>
<p>the soul in His hands to play upon as He will, while it calls Him,</p>
<p>OUR FATHER!</p>
<p>Some day, perhaps, you will go to the busy place where Bytown used</p>
<p>to be; and if you do, you must take the street by the river to the</p>
<p>white wooden church of St. Jacques.  It stands on the very spot</p>
<p>where there was once a cabin with a curved roof.  There is a gilt</p>
<p>cross on the top of the church.  The door is usually open, and the</p>
<p>interior is quite gay with vases of china and brass, and paper</p>
<p>flowers of many colours; but if you go through to the sacristy at</p>
<p>the rear, you will see a brown violin hanging on the wall.</p>
<p>Pere Baptiste, if he is there, will take it down and show it to you.</p>
<p>He calls it a remarkable instrument--one of the best, of the most</p>
<p>sweet.</p>
<p>But he will not let any one play upon it.  He says it is a relic.</p>
<p>THE REWARD OF VIRTUE</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>When the good priest of St. Gerome christened Patrick Mullarkey, he</p>
<p>lent himself unconsciously to an innocent deception.  To look at the</p>
<p>name, you would think, of course, it belonged to an Irishman; the</p>
<p>very appearance of it was equal to a certificate of membership in a</p>
<p>Fenian society</p>
<p>But in effect, from the turned-up toes of his bottes sauvages to the</p>
<p>ends of his black mustache, the proprietor of this name was a</p>
<p>Frenchman--Canadian French, you understand, and therefore even more</p>
<p>proud and tenacious of his race than if he had been born in</p>
<p>Normandy.  Somewhere in his family tree there must have been a graft</p>
<p>from the Green Isle.  A wandering lumberman from County Kerry had</p>
<p>drifted up the Saguenay into the Lake St. John region, and married</p>
<p>the daughter of a habitant, and settled down to forget his own</p>
<p>country and his father&#x27;s house.  But every visible trace of this</p>
<p>infusion of new blood had vanished long ago, except the name; and</p>
<p>the name itself was transformed on the lips of the St. Geromians.</p>
<p>If you had heard them speak it in their pleasant droning accent,--</p>
<p>&quot;Patrique Moullarque,&quot;--you would have supposed that it was made in</p>
<p>France.  To have a guide with such a name as that was as good as</p>
<p>being abroad.</p>
<p>Even when they cut it short and called him &quot;Patte,&quot; as they usually</p>
<p>did, it had a very foreign sound.  Everything about him was in</p>
<p>harmony with it; he spoke and laughed and sang and thought and felt</p>
<p>in French--the French of two hundred years ago, the language of</p>
<p>Samuel de Champlain and the Sieur de Monts, touched with a strong</p>
<p>woodland flavour.  In short, my guide, philosopher, and friend, Pat,</p>
<p>did not have a drop of Irish in him, unless, perhaps, it was a</p>
<p>certain--well, you shall judge for yourself, when you have heard</p>
<p>this story of his virtue, and the way it was rewarded.</p>
<p>It was on the shore of the Lac a la Belle Riviere, fifteen miles</p>
<p>back from St. Gerome, that I came into the story, and found myself,</p>
<p>as commonly happens in the real stories which life is always</p>
<p>bringing out in periodical form, somewhere about the middle of the</p>
<p>plot.  But Patrick readily made me acquainted with what had gone</p>
<p>before.  Indeed, it is one of life&#x27;s greatest charms as a story-</p>
<p>teller that there is never any trouble about getting a brief resume</p>
<p>of the argument, and even a listener who arrives late is soon put</p>
<p>into touch with the course of the narrative.</p>
<p>We had hauled our canoes and camp-stuff over the terrible road that</p>
<p>leads to the lake, with much creaking and groaning of wagons, and</p>
<p>complaining of men, who declared that the mud grew deeper and the</p>
<p>hills steeper every year, and vowed their customary vow never to</p>
<p>come that way again.  At last our tents were pitched in a green</p>
<p>copse of balsam trees, close beside the water.  The delightful sense</p>
<p>of peace and freedom descended upon our souls.  Prosper and Ovide</p>
<p>were cutting wood for the camp-fire; Francois was getting ready a</p>
<p>brace of partridges for supper; Patrick and I were unpacking the</p>
<p>provisions, arranging them conveniently for present use and future</p>
<p>transportation.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, Pat,&quot; said I, as my hand fell on a large square parcel--&quot;here</p>
<p>is some superfine tobacco that I got in Quebec for you and the other</p>
<p>men on this trip.  Not like the damp stuff you had last year--a</p>
<p>little bad smoke and too many bad words.  This is tobacco to burn--</p>
<p>something quite particular, you understand.  How does that please</p>
<p>you?&quot;</p>
<p>He had been rolling up a piece of salt pork in a cloth as I spoke,</p>
<p>and courteously wiped his fingers on the outside of the bundle</p>
<p>before he stretched out his hand to take the package of tobacco.</p>
<p>Then he answered, with his unfailing politeness, but more solemnly</p>
<p>than usual:</p>
<p>&quot;A thousand thanks to m&#x27;sieu&#x27;.  But this year I shall not have need</p>
<p>of the good tobacco.  It shall be for the others.&quot;</p>
<p>The reply was so unexpected that it almost took my breath away.  For</p>
<p>Pat, the steady smoker, whose pipes were as invariable as the</p>
<p>precession of the equinoxes, to refuse his regular rations of the</p>
<p>soothing weed was a thing unheard of.  Could he be growing proud in</p>
<p>his old age?  Had he some secret supply of cigars concealed in his</p>
<p>kit, which made him scorn the golden Virginia leaf?  I demanded an</p>
<p>explanation.</p>
<p>&quot;But no, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; he replied; &quot;it is not that, most assuredly.  It</p>
<p>is something entirely different--something very serious.  It is a</p>
<p>reformation that I commence.  Does m&#x27;sieu&#x27; permit that I should</p>
<p>inform him of it?&quot;</p>
<p>Of course I permitted, or rather, warmly encouraged, the fullest</p>
<p>possible unfolding of the tale; and while we sat among the bags and</p>
<p>boxes, and the sun settled gently down behind the sharp-pointed firs</p>
<p>across the lake, and the evening sky and the waveless lake glowed</p>
<p>with a thousand tints of deepening rose and amber, Patrick put me in</p>
<p>possession of the facts which had led to a moral revolution in his</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the Ma&#x27;m&#x27;selle Meelair, that young lady,--not very young,</p>
<p>but active like the youngest,--the one that I conducted down the</p>
<p>Grande Decharge to Chicoutimi last year, after you had gone away.</p>
<p>She said that she knew m&#x27;sieu&#x27; intimately.  No doubt you have a good</p>
<p>remembrance of her?&quot;</p>
<p>I admitted an acquaintance with the lady.  She was the president of</p>
<p>several societies for ethical agitation--a long woman, with short</p>
<p>hair and eyeglasses and a great thirst for tea; not very good in a</p>
<p>canoe, but always wanting to run the rapids and go into the</p>
<p>dangerous places, and talking all the time.  Yes; that must have</p>
<p>been the one.  She was not a bosom friend of mine, to speak</p>
<p>accurately, but I remembered her well.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; continued Patrick, &quot;it was this demoiselle</p>
<p>who changed my mind about the smoking.  But not in a moment, you</p>
<p>understand; it was a work of four days, and she spoke much.</p>
<p>&quot;The first day it was at the Island House; we were trolling for</p>
<p>ouananiche, and she was not pleased, for she lost many of the fish.</p>
<p>I was smoking at the stern of the canoe, and she said that the</p>
<p>tobacco was a filthy weed, that it grew in the devil&#x27;s garden, and</p>
<p>that it smelled bad, terribly bad, and that it made the air sick,</p>
<p>and that even the pig would not eat it.&quot;</p>
<p>I could imagine Patrick&#x27;s dismay as he listened to this</p>
<p>dissertation; for in his way he was as sensitive as a woman, and he</p>
<p>would rather have been upset in his canoe than have exposed himself</p>
<p>to the reproach of offending any one of his patrons by unpleasant or</p>
<p>unseemly conduct.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you do then, Pat?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly I put out the pipe--what could I do otherwise?  But I</p>
<p>thought that what the demoiselle Meelair has said was very strange,</p>
<p>and not true--exactly; for I have often seen the tobacco grow, and</p>
<p>it springs up out of the ground like the wheat or the beans, and it</p>
<p>has beautiful leaves, broad and green, with sometimes a red flower</p>
<p>at the top.  Does the good God cause the filthy weeds to grow like</p>
<p>that?  Are they not all clean that He has made?  The potato--it is</p>
<p>not filthy.  And the onion?  It has a strong smell; but the</p>
<p>demoiselle Meelair she ate much of the onion--when we were not at</p>
<p>the Island House, but in the camp.</p>
<p>&quot;And the smell of the tobacco--this is an affair of the taste.  For</p>
<p>me, I love it much; it is like a spice.  When I come home at night</p>
<p>to the camp-fire, where the boys are smoking, the smell of the pipes</p>
<p>runs far out into the woods to salute me.  It says, &#x27;Here we are,</p>
<p>Patrique; come in near to the fire.&#x27;  The smell of the tobacco is</p>
<p>more sweet than the smell of the fish.  The pig loves it not,</p>
<p>assuredly; but what then?  I am not a pig.  To me it is good, good,</p>
<p>good.  Don&#x27;t you find it like that, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;?</p>
<p>I had to confess that in the affair of taste I sided with Patrick</p>
<p>rather than with the pig.  &quot;Continue,&quot; I said--&quot;continue, my boy.</p>
<p>Miss Miller must have said more than that to reform you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truly,&quot; replied Pat.  &quot;On the second day we were making the lunch</p>
<p>at midday on the island below the first rapids.  I smoked the pipe</p>
<p>on a rock apart, after the collation.  Mees Meelair comes to me, and</p>
<p>says: &#x27;Patrique, my man, do you comprehend that the tobacco is a</p>
<p>poison?  You are committing the murder of yourself.&#x27;  Then she tells</p>
<p>me many things--about the nicoline, I think she calls him; how he</p>
<p>goes into the blood and into the bones and into the hair, and how</p>
<p>quickly he will kill the cat.  And she says, very strong, &#x27;The men</p>
<p>who smoke the tobacco shall die!&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That must have frightened you well, Pat.  I suppose you threw away</p>
<p>your pipe at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But no, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;; this time I continue to smoke, for now it is Mees</p>
<p>Meelair who comes near the pipe voluntarily, and it is not my</p>
<p>offence.  And I remember, while she is talking, the old bonhomme</p>
<p>Michaud St. Gerome.  He is a capable man; when he was young he could</p>
<p>carry a barrel of flour a mile without rest, and now that he has</p>
<p>seventy-three years he yet keeps his force.  And he smokes--it is</p>
<p>astonishing how that old man smokes!  All the day, except when he</p>
<p>sleeps.  If the tobacco is a poison, it is a poison of the slowest--</p>
<p>like the tea or the coffee.  For the cat it is quick--yes; but for</p>
<p>the man it is long; and I am still young--only thirty-one.</p>
<p>&quot;But the third day, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;--the third day was the worst.  It was a</p>
<p>day of sadness, a day of the bad chance.  The demoiselle Meelair was</p>
<p>not content but that we should leap the Rapide des Cedres in canoe.</p>
<p>It was rough, rough--all feather-white, and the big rock at the</p>
<p>corner boiling like a kettle.  But it is the ignorant who have the</p>
<p>most of boldness.  The demoiselle Meelair she was not solid in the</p>
<p>canoe.  She made a jump and a loud scream.  I did my possible, but</p>
<p>the sea was too high.  We took in of the water about five buckets.</p>
<p>We were very wet.  After that we make the camp; and while I sit by</p>
<p>the fire to dry my clothes I smoke for comfort.</p>
<p>&quot;Mees Meelair she comes to me once more.  &#x27;Patrique,&#x27; she says with</p>
<p>a sad voice, &#x27;I am sorry that a nice man, so good, so brave, is</p>
<p>married to a thing so bad, so sinful!&#x27;  At first I am mad when I</p>
<p>hear this, because I think she means Angelique, my wife; but</p>
<p>immediately she goes on: &#x27;You are married to the smoking.  That is</p>
<p>sinful; it is a wicked thing.  Christians do not smoke.  There is</p>
<p>none of the tobacco in heaven.  The men who use it cannot go there.</p>
<p>Ah, Patrique, do you wish to go to the hell with your pipe?&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That was a close question,&quot; I commented; &quot;your Miss Miller is a</p>
<p>plain speaker.  But what did you say when she asked you that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; replied Patrick, lifting his hand to his</p>
<p>forehead, &quot;that I must go where the good God pleased to send me, and</p>
<p>that I would have much joy to go to the same place with our cure,</p>
<p>the Pere Morel, who is a great smoker.  I am sure that the pipe of</p>
<p>comfort is no sin to that holy man when he returns, some cold night,</p>
<p>from the visiting of the sick--it is not sin, not more than the soft</p>
<p>chair and the warm fire.  It harms no one, and it makes quietness of</p>
<p>mind.  For me, when I see m&#x27;sieu&#x27; the cure sitting at the door of</p>
<p>the presbytere, in the evening coolness, smoking the tobacco, very</p>
<p>peaceful, and when he says to me, &#x27;Good day, Patrique; will you have</p>
<p>a pipeful?&#x27; I cannot think that is wicked--no!&quot;</p>
<p>There was a warmth of sincerity in the honest fellow&#x27;s utterance</p>
<p>that spoke well for the character of the cure of St. Gerome.  The</p>
<p>good word of a plain fisherman or hunter is worth more than a degree</p>
<p>of doctor of divinity from a learned university.</p>
<p>I too had grateful memories of good men, faithful, charitable, wise,</p>
<p>devout,--men before whose virtues my heart stood uncovered and</p>
<p>reverent, men whose lives were sweet with self-sacrifice, and whose</p>
<p>words were like stars of guidance to many souls,--and I had often</p>
<p>seen these men solacing their toils and inviting pleasant, kindly</p>
<p>thoughts with the pipe of peace.  I wondered whether Miss Miller</p>
<p>ever had the good fortune to meet any of these men.  They were not</p>
<p>members of the societies for ethical agitation, but they were</p>
<p>profitable men to know.  Their very presence was medicinal.  It</p>
<p>breathed patience and fidelity to duty, and a large, quiet</p>
<p>friendliness.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; I asked, &quot;what did she say finally to turn you?  What</p>
<p>was her last argument?  Come, Pat, you must make it a little shorter</p>
<p>than she did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In five words, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;, it was this: &#x27;The tobacco causes the</p>
<p>poverty.&#x27;  The fourth day--you remind yourself of the long dead-</p>
<p>water below the Rapide Gervais?  It was there.  All the day she</p>
<p>spoke to me of the money that goes to the smoke.  Two piastres the</p>
<p>month.  Twenty-four the year.  Three hundred--yes, with the</p>
<p>interest, more than three hundred in ten years!  Two thousand</p>
<p>piastres in the life of the man!  But she comprehends well the</p>
<p>arithmetic, that demoiselle Meelair; it was enormous!  The big</p>
<p>farmer Tremblay has not more money at the bank than that.  Then she</p>
<p>asks me if I have been at Quebec?  No.  If I would love to go?  Of</p>
<p>course, yes.  For two years of the smoking we could go, the goodwife</p>
<p>and me, to Quebec, and see the grand city, and the shops, and the</p>
<p>many people, and the cathedral, and perhaps the theatre.  And at the</p>
<p>asylum of the orphans we could seek one of the little found children</p>
<p>to bring home with us, to be our own; for m&#x27;sieu knows it is the</p>
<p>sadness of our house that we have no child.  But it was not Mees</p>
<p>Meelair who said that--no, she would not understand that thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Patrick paused for a moment, and rubbed his chin reflectively.  Then</p>
<p>he continued:</p>
<p>&quot;And perhaps it seems strange to you also, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;, that a poor man</p>
<p>should be so hungry for children.  It is not so everywhere: not in</p>
<p>America, I hear.  But it is so with us in Canada.  I know not a man</p>
<p>so poor that he would not feel richer for a child.  I know not a man</p>
<p>so happy that he would not feel happier with a child in the house.</p>
<p>It is the best thing that the good God gives to us; something to</p>
<p>work for; something to play with.  It makes a man more gentle and</p>
<p>more strong.  And a woman,--her heart is like an empty nest, if she</p>
<p>has not a child.  It was the darkest day that ever came to Angelique</p>
<p>and me when our little baby flew away, four years ago.  But perhaps</p>
<p>if we have not one of our own, there is another somewhere, a little</p>
<p>child of nobody, that belongs to us, for the sake of the love of</p>
<p>children.  Jean Boucher, my wife&#x27;s cousin, at St. Joseph d&#x27;Alma, has</p>
<p>taken two from the asylum.  Two, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;, I assure you for as soon</p>
<p>as one was twelve years old, he said he wanted a baby, and so he</p>
<p>went back again and got another.  That is what I should like to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, Pat,&quot; said I, &quot;it is an expensive business, this raising of</p>
<p>children.  You should think twice about it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; answered Patrick; &quot;I think a hundred times and</p>
<p>always the same way.  It costs little more for three, or four, or</p>
<p>five, in the house than for two.  The only thing is the money for</p>
<p>the journey to the city, the choice, the arrangement with the nuns.</p>
<p>For that one must save.  And so I have thrown away the pipe.  I</p>
<p>smoke no more.  The money of the tobacco is for Quebec and for the</p>
<p>little found child.  I have already eighteen piastres and twenty</p>
<p>sous in the old box of cigars on the chimney-piece at the house.</p>
<p>This year will bring more.  The winter after the next, if we have</p>
<p>the good chance, we go to the city, the goodwife and me, and we come</p>
<p>home with the little boy--or maybe the little girl.  Does m&#x27;sieu&#x27;</p>
<p>approve?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are a man of virtue, Pat,&quot; said I; &quot;and since you will not take</p>
<p>your share of the tobacco on this trip, it shall go to the other</p>
<p>men; but you shall have the money instead, to put into your box on</p>
<p>the mantel-piece.&quot;</p>
<p>After supper that evening I watched him with some curiosity to see</p>
<p>what he would do without his pipe.  He seemed restless and uneasy.</p>
<p>The other men sat around the fire, smoking; but Patrick was down at</p>
<p>the landing, fussing over one of the canoes, which had been somewhat</p>
<p>roughly handled on the road coming in.  Then he began to tighten the</p>
<p>tent-ropes, and hauled at them so vigorously that he loosened two of</p>
<p>the stakes.  Then he whittled the blade of his paddle for a while,</p>
<p>and cut it an inch too short.  Then he went into the men&#x27;s tent, and</p>
<p>in a few minutes the sound of snoring told that he had sought refuge</p>
<p>in sleep at eight o&#x27;clock, without telling a single caribou story,</p>
<p>or making any plans for the next day&#x27;s sport.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>For several days we lingered on the Lake of the Beautiful River,</p>
<p>trying the fishing.  We explored all the favourite meeting-places of</p>
<p>the trout, at the mouths of the streams and in the cool spring-</p>
<p>holes, but we did not have remarkable success.  I am bound to say</p>
<p>that Patrick was not at his best that year as a fisherman.  He was</p>
<p>as ready to work, as interested, as eager, as ever; but he lacked</p>
<p>steadiness, persistence, patience.  Some tranquillizing influence</p>
<p>seemed to have departed from him.  That placid confidence in the</p>
<p>ultimate certainty of catching fish, which is one of the chief</p>
<p>elements of good luck, was wanting.  He did not appear to be able to</p>
<p>sit still in the canoe.  The mosquitoes troubled him terribly.  He</p>
<p>was just as anxious as a man could be to have me take plenty of the</p>
<p>largest trout, but he was too much in a hurry.  He even went so far</p>
<p>as to say that he did not think I cast the fly as well as I did</p>
<p>formerly, and that I was too slow in striking when the fish rose.</p>
<p>He was distinctly a weaker man without his pipe, but his virtuous</p>
<p>resolve held firm.</p>
<p>There was one place in particular that required very cautious</p>
<p>angling.  It was a spring-hole at the mouth of the Riviere du</p>
<p>Milieu--an open space, about a hundred feet long and fifteen feet</p>
<p>wide, in the midst of the lily-pads, and surrounded on every side by</p>
<p>clear, shallow water.  Here the great trout assembled at certain</p>
<p>hours of the day; but it was not easy to get them.  You must come up</p>
<p>delicately in the canoe, and make fast to a stake at the side of the</p>
<p>pool, and wait a long time for the place to get quiet and the fish</p>
<p>to recover from their fright and come out from under the lily-pads.</p>
<p>It had been our custom to calm and soothe this expectant interval</p>
<p>with incense of the Indian weed, friendly to meditation and a foe of</p>
<p>&quot;Raw haste, half-sister to delay.&quot;  But this year Patrick could not</p>
<p>endure the waiting.  After five minutes he would say:</p>
<p>&quot;BUT the fishing is bad this season!  There are none of the big ones</p>
<p>here at all.  Let us try another place.  It will go better at the</p>
<p>Riviere du Cheval, perhaps.&quot;</p>
<p>There was only one thing that would really keep him quiet, and that</p>
<p>was a conversation about Quebec.  The glories of that wonderful city</p>
<p>entranced his thoughts.  He was already floating, in imagination,</p>
<p>with the vast throngs of people that filled its splendid streets,</p>
<p>looking up at the stately houses and churches with their glittering</p>
<p>roofs of tin, and staring his fill at the magnificent shop-windows,</p>
<p>where all the luxuries of the world were displayed.  He had heard</p>
<p>that there were more than a hundred shops--separate shops for all</p>
<p>kinds of separate things: some for groceries, and some for shoes,</p>
<p>and some for clothes, and some for knives and axes, and some for</p>
<p>guns, and many shops where they sold only jewels--gold rings, and</p>
<p>diamonds, and forks of pure silver.  Was it not so?</p>
<p>He pictured himself, side by side with his goodwife, in the salle a</p>
<p>manger of the Hotel Richelieu, ordering their dinner from a printed</p>
<p>bill of fare.  Side by side they were walking on the Dufferin</p>
<p>Terrace, listening to the music of the military band.  Side by side</p>
<p>they were watching the wonders of the play at the Theatre de</p>
<p>l&#x27;Etoile du Nord.  Side by side they were kneeling before the</p>
<p>gorgeous altar in the cathedral.  And then they were standing</p>
<p>silent, side by side, in the asylum of the orphans, looking at brown</p>
<p>eyes and blue, at black hair and yellow curls, at fat legs and rosy</p>
<p>cheeks and laughing mouths, while the Mother Superior showed off the</p>
<p>little boys and girls for them to choose.  This affair of the choice</p>
<p>was always a delightful difficulty, and here his fancy loved to hang</p>
<p>in suspense, vibrating between rival joys.</p>
<p>Once, at the Riviere du Milieu, after considerable discourse upon</p>
<p>Quebec, there was an interval of silence, during which I succeeded</p>
<p>in hooking and playing a larger trout than usual.  As the fish came</p>
<p>up to the side of the canoe, Patrick netted him deftly, exclaiming</p>
<p>with an abstracted air, &quot;It is a boy, after all.  I like that best.&quot;</p>
<p>Our camp was shifted, the second week, to the Grand Lac des Cedres;</p>
<p>and there we had extraordinary fortune with the trout: partly, I</p>
<p>conjecture, because there was only one place to fish, and so</p>
<p>Patrick&#x27;s uneasy zeal could find no excuse for keeping me in</p>
<p>constant motion all around the lake.  But in the matter of weather</p>
<p>we were not so happy.  There is always a conflict in the angler&#x27;s</p>
<p>mind about the weather--a struggle between his desires as a man and</p>
<p>his desires as a fisherman.  This time our prayers for a good</p>
<p>fishing season were granted at the expense of our suffering human</p>
<p>nature.  There was a conjunction in the zodiac of the signs of</p>
<p>Aquarius and Pisces.  It rained as easily, as suddenly, as</p>
<p>penetratingly, as Miss Miller talked; but in between the showers the</p>
<p>trout were very hungry.</p>
<p>One day, when we were paddling home to our tents among the birch</p>
<p>trees, one of these unexpected storms came up; and Patrick,</p>
<p>thoughtful of my comfort as ever, insisted on giving me his coat to</p>
<p>put around my dripping shoulders.  The paddling would serve instead</p>
<p>of a coat for him, he said; it would keep him warm to his bones.  As</p>
<p>I slipped the garment over my back, something hard fell from one of</p>
<p>the pockets into the bottom of the canoe.  It was a brier-wood pipe.</p>
<p>&quot;Aha! Pat,&quot; I cried; &quot;what is this?  You said you had thrown all</p>
<p>your pipes away.  How does this come in your pocket?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; he answered, &quot;this is different.  This is not the</p>
<p>pipe pure and simple.  It is a souvenir.  It is the one you gave me</p>
<p>two years ago on the Metabetchouan, when we got the big caribou.  I</p>
<p>could not reject this.  I keep it always for the remembrance.&quot;</p>
<p>At this moment my hand fell upon a small, square object in the other</p>
<p>pocket of the coat.  I pulled it out.  It was a cake of Virginia</p>
<p>leaf.  Without a word, I held it up, and looked at Patrick.  He</p>
<p>began to explain eagerly:</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, certainly, it is the tobacco, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;; but it is not for the</p>
<p>smoke, as you suppose.  It is for the virtue, for the self-victory.</p>
<p>I call this my little piece of temptation.  See; the edges are not</p>
<p>cut.  I smell it only; and when I think how it is good, then I speak</p>
<p>to myself, &#x27;But the little found child will be better!&#x27;  It will</p>
<p>last a long time, this little piece of temptation; perhaps until we</p>
<p>have the boy at our house--or maybe the girl.&quot;</p>
<p>The conflict between the cake of Virginia leaf and Patrick&#x27;s virtue</p>
<p>must have been severe during the last ten days of our expedition;</p>
<p>for we went down the Riviere des Ecorces, and that is a tough trip,</p>
<p>and full of occasions when consolation is needed.  After a long,</p>
<p>hard day&#x27;s work cutting out an abandoned portage through the woods,</p>
<p>or tramping miles over the incredibly shaggy hills to some outlying</p>
<p>pond for a caribou, and lugging the saddle and hind quarters back to</p>
<p>the camp, the evening pipe, after supper, seemed to comfort the men</p>
<p>unspeakably.  If their tempers had grown a little short under stress</p>
<p>of fatigue and hunger, now they became cheerful and good-natured</p>
<p>again.  They sat on logs before the camp-fire, their stockinged feet</p>
<p>stretched out to the blaze, and the puffs of smoke rose from their</p>
<p>lips like tiny salutes to the comfortable flame, or like incense</p>
<p>burned upon the altar of gratitude and contentment.</p>
<p>Patrick, I noticed about this time, liked to get on the leeward side</p>
<p>of as many pipes as possible, and as near as he could to the</p>
<p>smokers.  He said that this kept away the mosquitoes.  There he</p>
<p>would sit, with the smoke drifting full in his face, both hands in</p>
<p>his pockets, talking about Quebec, and debating the comparative</p>
<p>merits of a boy or a girl as an addition to his household.</p>
<p>But the great trial of his virtue was yet to come.  The main object</p>
<p>of our trip down the River of Barks--the terminus ad quem of the</p>
<p>expedition, so to speak--was a bear.  Now the bear as an object of</p>
<p>the chase, at least in Canada, is one of the most illusory of</p>
<p>phantoms.  The manner of hunting is simple.  It consists in walking</p>
<p>about through the woods, or paddling along a stream, until you meet</p>
<p>a bear; then you try to shoot him.  This would seem to be, as the</p>
<p>Rev. Mr. Leslie called his book against the deists of the eighteenth</p>
<p>century, &quot;A Short and Easie Method.&quot;  But in point of fact there are</p>
<p>two principal difficulties.  The first is that you never find the</p>
<p>bear when and where you are looking for him.  The second is that the</p>
<p>bear sometimes finds you when--but you shall see how it happened to us.</p>
<p>We had hunted the whole length of the River of Barks with the utmost</p>
<p>pains and caution, never going out, even to pick blueberries,</p>
<p>without having the rifle at hand, loaded for the expected encounter.</p>
<p>Not one bear had we met.  It seemed as if the whole ursine tribe</p>
<p>must have emigrated to Labrador.</p>
<p>At last we came to the mouth of the river, where it empties into</p>
<p>Lake Kenogami, in a comparatively civilized country, with several</p>
<p>farm-houses in full view on the opposite bank.  It was not a</p>
<p>promising place for the chase; but the river ran down with a little</p>
<p>fall and a lively, cheerful rapid into the lake, and it was a</p>
<p>capital spot for fishing.  So we left the rifle in the case, and</p>
<p>took a canoe and a rod, and went down, on the last afternoon, to</p>
<p>stand on the point of rocks at the foot of the rapid, and cast the</p>
<p>fly.</p>
<p>We caught half a dozen good trout; but the sun was still hot, and we</p>
<p>concluded to wait awhile for the evening fishing.  So we turned the</p>
<p>canoe bottom up among the bushes on the shore, stored the trout away</p>
<p>in the shade beneath it, and sat down in a convenient place among</p>
<p>the stones to have another chat about Quebec.  We had just passed</p>
<p>the jewelry shops, and were preparing to go to the asylum of the</p>
<p>orphans, when Patrick put his hand on my shoulder with a convulsive</p>
<p>grip, and pointed up the stream.</p>
<p>There was a huge bear, like a very big, wicked, black sheep with a</p>
<p>pointed nose, making his way down the shore.  He shambled along</p>
<p>lazily and unconcernedly, as if his bones were loosely tied together</p>
<p>in a bag of fur.  It was the most indifferent and disconnected gait</p>
<p>that I ever saw.  Nearer and nearer he sauntered, while we sat as</p>
<p>still as if we had been paralyzed.  And the gun was in its case at</p>
<p>the tent!</p>
<p>How the bear knew this I cannot tell; but know it he certainly did,</p>
<p>for he kept on until he reached the canoe, sniffed at it</p>
<p>suspiciously, thrust his sharp nose under it, and turned it over</p>
<p>with a crash that knocked two holes in the bottom, ate the fish,</p>
<p>licked his chops, stared at us for a few moments without the</p>
<p>slightest appearance of gratitude, made up his mind that he did not</p>
<p>like our personal appearance, and then loped leisurely up the</p>
<p>mountain-side.  We could hear him cracking the underbrush long after</p>
<p>he was lost to sight.</p>
<p>Patrick looked at me and sighed.  I said nothing.  The French</p>
<p>language, as far as I knew it, seemed trifling and inadequate.  It</p>
<p>was a moment when nothing could do any good except the consolations</p>
<p>of philosophy, or a pipe.  Patrick pulled the brier-wood from his</p>
<p>pocket; then he took out the cake of Virginia leaf, looked at it,</p>
<p>smelled it, shook his head, and put it back again.  His face was as</p>
<p>long as his arm.  He stuck the cold pipe into his mouth, and pulled</p>
<p>away at it for a while in silence.  Then his countenance began to</p>
<p>clear, his mouth relaxed, he broke into a laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;Sacred bear!&quot; he cried, slapping his knee; &quot;sacred beast of the</p>
<p>world!  What a day of the good chance for her, HE!  But she was</p>
<p>glad, I suppose.  Perhaps she has some cubs, HE?  BAJETTE!&quot;</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>This was the end of our hunting and fishing for that year.  We spent</p>
<p>the next two days in voyaging through a half-dozen small lakes and</p>
<p>streams, in a farming country, on our way home.  I observed that</p>
<p>Patrick kept his souvenir pipe between his lips a good deal of the</p>
<p>time, and puffed at vacancy.  It seemed to soothe him.  In his</p>
<p>conversation he dwelt with peculiar satisfaction on the thought of</p>
<p>the money in the cigar-box on the mantel-piece at St. Gerome.</p>
<p>Eighteen piastres and twenty sous already!  And with the addition to</p>
<p>be made from the tobacco not smoked during the past month, it would</p>
<p>amount to more than twenty-three piastres; and all as safe in the</p>
<p>cigar-box as if it were in the bank at Chicoutimi!  That reflection</p>
<p>seemed to fill the empty pipe with fragrance.  It was a Barmecide</p>
<p>smoke; but the fumes of it were potent, and their invisible wreaths</p>
<p>framed the most enchanting visions of tall towers, gray walls,</p>
<p>glittering windows, crowds of people, regiments of soldiers, and the</p>
<p>laughing eyes of a little boy--or was it a little girl?</p>
<p>When we came out of the mouth of La Belle Riviere, the broad blue</p>
<p>expanse of Lake St. John spread before us, calm and bright in the</p>
<p>radiance of the sinking sun.  In a curve on the left, eight miles</p>
<p>away, sparkled the slender steeple of the church of St. Gerome.  A</p>
<p>thick column of smoke rose from somewhere in its neighbourhood.  &quot;It</p>
<p>is on the beach,&quot; said the men; &quot;the boys of the village accustom</p>
<p>themselves to burn the rubbish there for a bonfire.&quot;  But as our</p>
<p>canoes danced lightly forward over the waves and came nearer to the</p>
<p>place, it was evident that the smoke came from the village itself.</p>
<p>It was a conflagration, but not a general one; the houses were too</p>
<p>scattered and the day too still for a fire to spread.  What could it</p>
<p>be?  Perhaps the blacksmith shop, perhaps the bakery, perhaps the</p>
<p>old tumble-down barn of the little Tremblay?  It was not a large</p>
<p>fire, that was certain.  But where was it precisely?</p>
<p>The question, becoming more and more anxious, was answered when we</p>
<p>arrived at the beach.  A handful of boys, eager to be the bearers of</p>
<p>news, had spied us far off, and ran down to the shore to meet us.</p>
<p>&quot;Patrique!  Patrique!&quot; they shouted in English, to make their</p>
<p>importance as great as possible in my eyes.  &quot;Come &#x27;ome kveek; yo&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;ouse ees hall burn&#x27;!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;W&#x27;at!&quot; cried Patrick.  &quot;MONJEE!&quot;  And he drove the canoe ashore,</p>
<p>leaped out, and ran up the bank toward the village as if he were</p>
<p>mad.  The other men followed him, leaving me with the boys to unload</p>
<p>the canoes and pull them up on the sand, where the waves would not</p>
<p>chafe them.</p>
<p>This took some time, and the boys helped me willingly.  &quot;Eet ees not</p>
<p>need to &#x27;urry, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; they assured me; &quot;dat &#x27;ouse to Patrique</p>
<p>Moullarque ees hall burn&#x27; seence t&#x27;ree hour.  Not&#x27;ing lef&#x27; bot de</p>
<p>hash.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as possible, however, I piled up the stuff, covered it with</p>
<p>one of the tents, and leaving it in charge of the steadiest of the</p>
<p>boys, took the road to the village and the site of the Maison</p>
<p>Mullarkey.</p>
<p>It had vanished completely: the walls of squared logs were gone; the</p>
<p>low, curved roof had fallen; the door-step with the morning-glory</p>
<p>vines climbing up beside it had sunken out of sight; nothing</p>
<p>remained but the dome of the clay oven at the back of the house, and</p>
<p>a heap of smouldering embers.</p>
<p>Patrick sat beside his wife on a flat stone that had formerly</p>
<p>supported the corner of the porch.  His shoulder was close to</p>
<p>Angelique&#x27;s--so close that it looked almost as if he must have had</p>
<p>his arm around her a moment before I came up.  His passion and grief</p>
<p>had calmed themselves down now, and he was quite tranquil.  In his</p>
<p>left hand he held the cake of Virginia leaf, in his right a knife.</p>
<p>He was cutting off delicate slivers of the tobacco, which he rolled</p>
<p>together with a circular motion between his palms.  Then he pulled</p>
<p>his pipe from his pocket and filled the bowl with great</p>
<p>deliberation.</p>
<p>&quot;What a misfortune!&quot; I cried.  &quot;The pretty house is gone.  I am so</p>
<p>sorry, Patrick.  And the box of money on the mantel-piece, that is</p>
<p>gone, too, I fear--all your savings.  What a terrible misfortune!</p>
<p>How did it happen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot tell,&quot; he answered rather slowly.  &quot;It is the good God.</p>
<p>And he has left me my Angelique.  Also, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;, you see&quot;--here he</p>
<p>went over to the pile of ashes, and pulled out a fragment of charred</p>
<p>wood with a live coal at the end--&quot;you see&quot;--puff, puff--&quot;he has</p>
<p>given me&quot;--puff, puff--&quot;a light for my pipe again&quot;--puff, puff,</p>
<p>puff!</p>
<p>The fragrant, friendly smoke was pouring out now in full volume.  It</p>
<p>enwreathed his head like drifts of cloud around the rugged top of a</p>
<p>mountain at sunrise.  I could see that his face was spreading into a</p>
<p>smile of ineffable contentment.</p>
<p>&quot;My faith!&quot; said I, &quot;how can you be so cheerful?  Your house is in</p>
<p>ashes; your money is burned up; the voyage to Quebec, the visit to</p>
<p>the asylum, the little orphan--how can you give it all up so</p>
<p>easily?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he replied, taking the pipe from his mouth, with fingers</p>
<p>curling around the bowl, as if they loved to feel that it was warm</p>
<p>once more--&quot;well, then, it would be more hard, I suppose, to give it</p>
<p>up not easily.  And then, for the house, we shall build a new one</p>
<p>this fall; the neighbours will help.  And for the voyage to Quebec--</p>
<p>without that we may be happy.  And as regards the little orphan, I</p>
<p>will tell you frankly&quot;--here he went back to his seat upon the flat</p>
<p>stone, and settled himself with an air of great comfort beside his</p>
<p>partner--&quot;I tell you, in confidence, Angelique demands that I</p>
<p>prepare a particular furniture at the new house.  Yes, it is a</p>
<p>cradle; but it is not for an orphan.&quot;</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>It was late in the following summer when I came back again to St.</p>
<p>Gerome.  The golden-rods and the asters were all in bloom along the</p>
<p>village street; and as I walked down it the broad golden sunlight of</p>
<p>the short afternoon seemed to glorify the open road and the plain</p>
<p>square houses with a careless, homely rapture of peace.  The air was</p>
<p>softly fragrant with the odour of balm of Gilead.  A yellow warbler</p>
<p>sang from a little clump of elder-bushes, tinkling out his contented</p>
<p>song like a chime of tiny bells, &quot;Sweet--sweet--sweet--sweeter--</p>
<p>sweeter--sweetest!&quot;</p>
<p>There was the new house, a little farther back from the road than</p>
<p>the old one; and in the place where the heap of ashes had lain, a</p>
<p>primitive garden, with marigolds and lupines and zinnias all abloom.</p>
<p>And there was Patrick, sitting on the door-step, smoking his pipe in</p>
<p>the cool of the day.  Yes; and there, on a many-coloured counterpane</p>
<p>spread beside him, an infant joy of the house of Mullarkey was</p>
<p>sucking her thumb, while her father was humming the words of an old</p>
<p>slumber-song:</p>

<p>&quot;Hola! Patrick,&quot; I cried; &quot;good luck to you!  Is it a girl or a</p>
<p>boy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;SALUT! m&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; he answered, jumping up and waving his pipe.  &quot;It</p>
<p>is a girl AND a boy!&quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, as I entered the door, I beheld Angelique rocking the</p>
<p>other half of the reward of virtue in the new cradle.</p>
<p>A BRAVE HEART</p>
<p>&quot;That was truly his name, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;--Raoul Vaillantcoeur--a name of</p>
<p>the fine sound, is it not?  You like that word,--a valiant heart,--</p>
<p>it pleases you, eh!  The man who calls himself by such a name as</p>
<p>that ought to be a brave fellow, a veritable hero?  Well, perhaps.</p>
<p>But I know an Indian who is called Le Blanc; that means white.  And</p>
<p>a white man who is called Lenoir; that means black.  It is very</p>
<p>droll, this affair of the names.  It is like the lottery.&quot;</p>
<p>Silence for a few moments, broken only by the ripple of water under</p>
<p>the bow of the canoe, the persistent patter of the rain all around</p>
<p>us, and the SLISH, SLISH of the paddle with which Ferdinand, my</p>
<p>Canadian voyageur, was pushing the birch-bark down the lonely length</p>
<p>of Lac Moise.  I knew that there was one of his stories on the way.</p>
<p>But I must keep still to get it.  A single ill-advised comment, a</p>
<p>word that would raise a question of morals or social philosophy,</p>
<p>might switch the narrative off the track into a swamp of abstract</p>
<p>discourse in which Ferdinand would lose himself.  Presently the</p>
<p>voice behind me began again.</p>
<p>&quot;But that word VAILLANT, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;; with us in Canada it does not mean</p>
<p>always the same as with you.  Sometimes we use it for something that</p>
<p>sounds big, but does little; a gun that goes off with a terrible</p>
<p>crack, but shoots not straight nor far.  When a man is like that he</p>
<p>is FANFARON, he shows off well, but--well, you shall judge for</p>
<p>yourself, when you hear what happened between this man Vaillantcoeur</p>
<p>and his friend Prosper Leclere at the building of the stone tower of</p>
<p>the church at Abbeville.  You remind yourself of that grand church</p>
<p>with the tall tower--yes?  With permission I am going to tell you</p>
<p>what passed when that was made.  And you shall decide whether there</p>
<p>was truly a brave heart in the story, or not; and if it went with</p>
<p>the name.</p>
<p>Thus the tale began, in the vast solitude of the northern forest,</p>
<p>among the granite peaks of the ancient Laurentian Mountains, on a</p>
<p>lake that knew no human habitation save the Indian&#x27;s wigwam or the</p>
<p>fisherman&#x27;s tent.</p>
<p>How it rained that day!  The dark clouds had collapsed upon the</p>
<p>hills in shapeless folds.  The waves of the lake were beaten flat by</p>
<p>the lashing strokes of the storm.  Quivering sheets of watery gray</p>
<p>were driven before the wind; and broad curves of silver bullets</p>
<p>danced before them as they swept over the surface.  All around the</p>
<p>homeless shores the evergreen trees seemed to hunch their backs and</p>
<p>crowd closer together in patient misery.  Not a bird had the heart</p>
<p>to sing; only the loon--storm-lover--laughed his crazy challenge to</p>
<p>the elements, and mocked us with his long-drawn maniac scream.</p>
<p>It seemed as if we were a thousand miles from everywhere and</p>
<p>everybody.  Cities, factories, libraries, colleges, law-courts,</p>
<p>theatres, palaces,--what had we dreamed of these things?  They were</p>
<p>far off, in another world.  We had slipped back into a primitive</p>
<p>life.  Ferdinand was telling me the naked story of human love and</p>
<p>human hate, even as it has been told from the beginning.</p>
<p>I cannot tell it just as he did.  There was a charm in his speech</p>
<p>too quick for the pen: a woodland savour not to be found in any ink</p>
<p>for sale in the shops.  I must tell it in my way, as he told it in</p>
<p>his.</p>
<p>But at all events, nothing that makes any difference shall go into</p>
<p>the translation unless it was in the original.  This is Ferdinand&#x27;s</p>
<p>story.  If you care for the real thing, here it is.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>There were two young men in Abbeville who were easily the cocks of</p>
<p>the woodland walk.  Their standing rested on the fact that they were</p>
<p>the strongest men in the parish.  Strength is the thing that counts,</p>
<p>when people live on the edge of the wilderness.  These two were well</p>
<p>known all through the country between Lake St. John and Chicoutimi</p>
<p>as men of great capacity.  Either of them could shoulder a barrel of</p>
<p>flour and walk off with it as lightly as a common man would carry a</p>
<p>side of bacon.  There was not a half-pound of difference between</p>
<p>them in ability.  But there was a great difference in their looks</p>
<p>and in their way of doing things.</p>
<p>Raoul Vaillantcoeur was the biggest and the handsomest man in the</p>
<p>village; nearly six feet tall, straight as a fir tree, and black as</p>
<p>a bull-moose in December.  He had natural force enough and to spare.</p>
<p>Whatever he did was done by sheer power of back and arm.  He could</p>
<p>send a canoe up against the heaviest water, provided he did not get</p>
<p>mad and break his paddle--which he often did.  He had more muscle</p>
<p>than he knew how to use.</p>
<p>Prosper Leclere did not have so much, but he knew better how to</p>
<p>handle it.  He never broke his paddle--unless it happened to be a</p>
<p>bad one, and then he generally had another all ready in the canoe.</p>
<p>He was at least four inches shorter than Vaillantcoeur; broad</p>
<p>shoulders, long arms, light hair, gray eyes; not a handsome fellow,</p>
<p>but pleasant-looking and very quiet.  What he did was done more than</p>
<p>half with his head.</p>
<p>He was the kind of a man that never needs more than one match to</p>
<p>light a fire.</p>
<p>But Vaillantcoeur--well, if the wood was wet he might use a dozen,</p>
<p>and when the blaze was kindled, as like as not he would throw in the</p>
<p>rest of the box.</p>
<p>Now, these two men had been friends and were changed into rivals.</p>
<p>At least that was the way that one of them looked at it.  And most</p>
<p>of the people in the parish seemed to think that was the right view.</p>
<p>It was a strange thing, and not altogether satisfactory to the</p>
<p>public mind, to have two strongest men in the village.  The question</p>
<p>of comparative standing in the community ought to be raised and</p>
<p>settled in the usual way.  Raoul was perfectly willing, and at times</p>
<p>(commonly on Saturday nights) very eager.  But Prosper was not.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, one March night, when he was boiling maple-sap in the</p>
<p>sugar-bush with little Ovide Rossignol (who had a lyric passion for</p>
<p>holding the coat while another man was fighting)--&quot;no, for what</p>
<p>shall I fight with Raoul?  As boys we have played together.  Once,</p>
<p>in the rapids of the Belle Riviere, when I have fallen in the water,</p>
<p>I think he has saved my life.  He was stronger, then, than me.  I am</p>
<p>always a friend to him.  If I beat him now, am I stronger?  No, but</p>
<p>weaker.  And if he beats me, what is the sense of that?  Certainly I</p>
<p>shall not like it.  What is to gain?&quot;</p>
<p>Down in the store of old Girard, that night, Vaillantcoeur was</p>
<p>holding forth after a different fashion.  He stood among the</p>
<p>cracker-boxes and flour-barrels, with a background of shelves laden</p>
<p>with bright-coloured calicoes, and a line of tin pails hanging</p>
<p>overhead, and stated his view of the case with vigour.  He even</p>
<p>pulled off his coat and rolled up his shirt-sleeve to show the</p>
<p>knotty arguments with which he proposed to clinch his opinion.</p>
<p>&quot;That Leclere,&quot; said he, &quot;that little Prosper Leclere!  He thinks</p>
<p>himself one of the strongest--a fine fellow!  But I tell you he is a</p>
<p>coward.  If he is clever?  Yes.  But he is a poltroon.  He knows</p>
<p>well that I can flatten him out like a crepe in the frying-pan.  But</p>
<p>he is afraid.  He has not as much courage as the musk-rat.  You</p>
<p>stamp on the bank.  He dives.  He swims away.  Bah!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about that time he cut loose the jam of logs in the Rapide des</p>
<p>Cedres?&quot; said old Girard from his corner.</p>
<p>Vaillantcoeur&#x27;s black eyes sparkled and he twirled his mustache</p>
<p>fiercely.  &quot;SAPRIE!&quot; he cried, &quot;that was nothing!  Any man with an</p>
<p>axe can cut a log.  But to fight--that is another affair.  That</p>
<p>demands the brave heart.  The strong man who will not fight is a</p>
<p>coward.  Some day I will put him through the mill--you shall see</p>
<p>what that small Leclere is made of.  SACREDAM!&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, affairs had not come to this pass all at once.  It was a</p>
<p>long history, beginning with the time when the two boys had played</p>
<p>together, and Raoul was twice as strong as the other, and was very</p>
<p>proud of it.  Prosper did not care; it was all right so long as they</p>
<p>had a good time.  But then Prosper began to do things better and</p>
<p>better.  Raoul did not understand it; he was jealous.  Why should he</p>
<p>not always be the leader?  He had more force.  Why should Prosper</p>
<p>get ahead?  Why should he have better luck at the fishing and the</p>
<p>hunting and the farming?  It was by some trick.  There was no</p>
<p>justice in it.</p>
<p>Raoul was not afraid of anything but death; and whatever he wanted,</p>
<p>he thought he had a right to have.  But he did not know very well</p>
<p>how to get it.  He would start to chop a log just at the spot where</p>
<p>there was a big knot.</p>
<p>He was the kind of a man that sets hare-snares on a caribou-trail,</p>
<p>and then curses his luck because he catches nothing.</p>
<p>Besides, whatever he did, he was always thinking most about beating</p>
<p>somebody else.  But Prosper eared most for doing the thing as well</p>
<p>as he could.  If any one else could beat him--well, what difference</p>
<p>did it make?  He would do better the next time.</p>
<p>If he had a log to chop, he looked it all over for a clear place</p>
<p>before he began.  What he wanted was, not to make the chips fly, but</p>
<p>to get the wood split.</p>
<p>You are not to suppose that the one man was a saint and a hero, and</p>
<p>the other a fool and a ruffian.  No; that sort of thing happens only</p>
<p>in books.  People in Abbeville were not made on that plan.  They</p>
<p>were both plain men.  But there was a difference in their hearts;</p>
<p>and out of that difference grew all the trouble.</p>
<p>It was hard on Vaillantcoeur, of course, to see Leclere going ahead,</p>
<p>getting rich, clearing off the mortgage on his farm, laying up money</p>
<p>with the notary Bergeron, who acted as banker for the parish--it was</p>
<p>hard to look on at this, while he himself stood still, or even</p>
<p>slipped back a little, got into debt, had to sell a bit of the land</p>
<p>that his father left him.  There must be some cheating about it.</p>
<p>But this was not the hardest morsel to swallow.  The great thing</p>
<p>that stuck in his crop was the idea that the little Prosper, whom he</p>
<p>could have whipped so easily, and whom he had protected so loftily,</p>
<p>when they were boys, now stood just as high as he did as a capable</p>
<p>man--perhaps even higher.  Why was it that when the Price Brothers,</p>
<p>down at Chicoutimi, had a good lumber-job up in the woods on the</p>
<p>Belle Riviere, they made Leclere the boss, instead of Vaillantcoeur?</p>
<p>Why did the cure Villeneuve choose Prosper, and not Raoul, to steady</p>
<p>the strain of the biggest pole when they were setting up the derrick</p>
<p>for the building of the new church?</p>
<p>It was rough, rough!  The more Raoul thought of it, the rougher it</p>
<p>seemed.  The fact that it was a man who had once been his protege,</p>
<p>and still insisted on being his best friend, did not make it any</p>
<p>smoother.  Would you have liked it any better on that account?  I am</p>
<p>not telling you how it ought to have been, I am telling you how it</p>
<p>was.  This isn&#x27;t Vaillantcoeur&#x27;s account-book; it&#x27;s his story.  You</p>
<p>must strike your balances as you go along.</p>
<p>And all the time, you see, he felt sure that he was a stronger man</p>
<p>and a braver man than Prosper.  He was hungry to prove it in the</p>
<p>only way that he could understand.  The sense of rivalry grew into a</p>
<p>passion of hatred, and the hatred shaped itself into a blind,</p>
<p>headstrong desire to fight.  Everything that Prosper did well,</p>
<p>seemed like a challenge; every success that he had was as hard to</p>
<p>bear as an insult.  All the more, because Prosper seemed unconscious</p>
<p>of it.  He refused to take offence, went about his work quietly and</p>
<p>cheerfully, turned off hard words with a joke, went out of his way</p>
<p>to show himself friendly and good-natured.  In reality, of course,</p>
<p>he knew well enough how matters stood.  But he was resolved not to</p>
<p>show that he knew, if he could help it; and in any event, not to be</p>
<p>one of the two that are needed to make a quarrel.</p>
<p>He felt very strangely about it.  There was a presentiment in his</p>
<p>heart that he did not dare to shake off.  It seemed as if this</p>
<p>conflict were one that would threaten the happiness of his whole</p>
<p>life.  He still kept his old feeling of attraction to Raoul, the</p>
<p>memory of the many happy days they had spent together; and though</p>
<p>the friendship, of course, could never again be what it had been,</p>
<p>there was something of it left, at least on Prosper&#x27;s side.  To</p>
<p>struggle with this man, strike at his face, try to maim and</p>
<p>disfigure him, roll over and over on the ground with him, like two</p>
<p>dogs tearing each other,--the thought was hateful.  His gorge rose</p>
<p>at it.  He would never do it, unless to save his life.  Then?  Well,</p>
<p>then, God must be his judge.</p>
<p>So it was that these two men stood against each other in Abbeville.</p>
<p>Just as strongly as Raoul was set to get into a fight, just so</p>
<p>strongly was Prosper set to keep out of one.  It was a trial of</p>
<p>strength between two passions,--the passion of friendship and the</p>
<p>passion of fighting.</p>
<p>Two or three things happened to put an edge on Raoul&#x27;s hunger for an</p>
<p>out-and-out fight.</p>
<p>The first was the affair at the shanty on Lac des Caps.  The wood-</p>
<p>choppers, like sailors, have a way of putting a new man through a</p>
<p>few tricks to initiate him into the camp.  Leclere was bossing the</p>
<p>job, with a gang of ten men from St. Raymond under him.</p>
<p>Vaillantcoeur had just driven a team in over the snow with a load of</p>
<p>provisions, and was lounging around the camp as if it belonged to</p>
<p>him.  It was Sunday afternoon, the regular time for fun, but no one</p>
<p>dared to take hold of him.  He looked too big.  He expressed his</p>
<p>opinion of the camp.</p>
<p>&quot;No fun in this shanty, HE?  I suppose that little Leclere he makes</p>
<p>you others work, and say your prayers, and then, for the rest, you</p>
<p>can sleep.  HE!  Well, I am going to make a little fun for you, my</p>
<p>boys.  Come, Prosper, get your hat, if you are able to climb a tree.&quot;</p>
<p>He snatched the hat from the table by the stove and ran out into the</p>
<p>snow.  In front of the shanty a good-sized birch, tall, smooth, very</p>
<p>straight, was still standing.  He went up the trunk like a bear.</p>
<p>But there was a dead balsam that had fallen against the birch and</p>
<p>lodged on the lower branches.  It was barely strong enough to bear</p>
<p>the weight of a light man.  Up this slanting ladder Prosper ran</p>
<p>quickly in his moccasined feet, snatched the hat from Raoul&#x27;s teeth</p>
<p>as he swarmed up the trunk, and ran down again.  As he neared the</p>
<p>ground, the balsam, shaken from its lodgement, cracked and fell.</p>
<p>Raoul was left up the tree, perched among the branches, out of</p>
<p>breath.  Luck had set the scene for the lumberman&#x27;s favourite trick.</p>
<p>&quot;Chop him down! chop him down&quot; was the cry; and a trio of axes were</p>
<p>twanging against the birch tree, while the other men shouted and</p>
<p>laughed and pelted the tree with ice to keep the prisoner from</p>
<p>climbing down.</p>
<p>Prosper neither shouted nor chopped, but he grinned a little as he</p>
<p>watched the tree quiver and shake, and heard the rain of &quot;SACRES!&quot;</p>
<p>and &quot;MAUDITS!&quot; that came out of the swaying top.  He grinned--until</p>
<p>he saw that a half-dozen more blows would fell the birch right on</p>
<p>the roof of the shanty.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you crazy?&quot; he cried, as he picked up an axe; &quot;you know nothing</p>
<p>how to chop.  You kill a man.  You smash the cabane.  Let go!&quot;  He</p>
<p>shoved one of the boys away and sent a few mighty cuts into the side</p>
<p>of the birch that was farthest from the cabin; then two short cuts</p>
<p>on the other side; the tree shivered, staggered, cracked, and swept</p>
<p>in a great arc toward the deep snow-drift by the brook.  As the top</p>
<p>swung earthward, Raoul jumped clear of the crashing branches and</p>
<p>landed safely in the feather-bed of snow, buried up to his neck.</p>
<p>Nothing was to be seen of him but his head, like some new kind of</p>
<p>fire-work--sputtering bad words.</p>
<p>Well, this was the first thing that put an edge on Vaillantcoeur&#x27;s</p>
<p>hunger to fight.  No man likes to be chopped down by his friend,</p>
<p>even if the friend does it for the sake of saving him from being</p>
<p>killed by a fall on the shanty-roof.  It is easy to forget that part</p>
<p>of it.  What you remember is the grin.</p>
<p>The second thing that made it worse was the bad chance that both of</p>
<p>these men had to fall in love with the same girl.  Of course there</p>
<p>were other girls in the village beside Marie Antoinette Girard--</p>
<p>plenty of them, and good girls, too.  But somehow or other, when</p>
<p>they were beside her, neither Raoul nor Prosper cared to look at any</p>
<p>of them, but only at &#x27;Toinette.  Her eyes were so much darker and</p>
<p>her cheeks so much more red--bright as the berries of the mountain-</p>
<p>ash in September.  Her hair hung down to her waist on Sunday in two</p>
<p>long braids, brown and shiny like a ripe hazelnut; and her voice</p>
<p>when she laughed made the sound of water tumbling over little</p>
<p>stones.</p>
<p>No one knew which of the two lovers she liked best. At school it was</p>
<p>certainly Raoul, because he was bigger and bolder.  When she came</p>
<p>back from her year in the convent at Roberval it was certainly</p>
<p>Prosper, because he could talk better and had read more books.  He</p>
<p>had a volume of songs full of love and romance, and knew most of</p>
<p>them by heart.  But this did not last forever.  &#x27;Toinette&#x27;s manners</p>
<p>had been polished at the convent, but her ideas were still those of</p>
<p>her own people.  She never thought that knowledge of books could</p>
<p>take the place of strength, in the real battle of life.  She was a</p>
<p>brave girl, and she felt sure in her heart that the man of the most</p>
<p>courage must be the best man after all.</p>
<p>For a while she appeared to persuade herself that it was Prosper,</p>
<p>beyond a doubt, and always took his part when the other girls</p>
<p>laughed at him.  But this was not altogether a good sign.  When a</p>
<p>girl really loves, she does not talk, she acts.  The current of</p>
<p>opinion and gossip in the village was too strong for her.  By the</p>
<p>time of the affair of the &quot;chopping-down&quot; at Lac des Caps, her heart</p>
<p>was swinging to and fro like a pendulum.  One week she would walk</p>
<p>home from mass with Raoul.  The next week she would loiter in the</p>
<p>front yard on a Saturday evening and talk over the gate with</p>
<p>Prosper, until her father called her into the shop to wait on</p>
<p>customers.</p>
<p>It was in one of these talks that the pendulum seemed to make its</p>
<p>last swing and settle down to its resting-place.  Prosper was</p>
<p>telling her of the good crops of sugar that he had made from his</p>
<p>maple grove.</p>
<p>&quot;The profit will be large--more than sixty piastres--and with that I</p>
<p>shall buy at Chicoutimi a new four-wheeler, of the finest, a</p>
<p>veritable wedding carriage--if you--if I--&#x27;Toinette?  Shall we ride</p>
<p>together?&quot;</p>
<p>His left hand clasped hers as it lay on the gate.  His right arm</p>
<p>stole over the low picket fence and went around the shoulder that</p>
<p>leaned against the gate-post. The road was quite empty, the night</p>
<p>already dark.  He could feel her warm breath on his neck as she</p>
<p>laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;If you!  If I!  If what?  Why so many ifs in this fine speech?  Of</p>
<p>whom is the wedding for which this new carriage is to be bought?  Do</p>
<p>you know what Raoul Vaillantcoeur has said?  &#x27;No more wedding in</p>
<p>this parish till I have thrown the little Prosper over my</p>
<p>shoulder!&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>As she said this, laughing, she turned closer to the fence and</p>
<p>looked up, so that a curl on her forehead brushed against his cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;BATECHE!  Who told you he said that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I heard him, myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the store, two nights ago.  But it was not for the first time.</p>
<p>He said it when we came from the church together, it will be four</p>
<p>weeks to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What did you say to him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told him perhaps he was mistaken.  The next wedding might be</p>
<p>after the little Prosper had measured the road with the back of the</p>
<p>longest man in Abbeville.&quot;</p>
<p>The laugh had gone out of her voice now.  She was speaking eagerly,</p>
<p>and her bosom rose and fell with quick breaths.  But Prosper&#x27;s right</p>
<p>arm had dropped from her shoulder, and his hand gripped the fence as</p>
<p>he straightened up.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Toinette!&quot; he cried, &quot;that was bravely said.  And I could do it.</p>
<p>Yes, I know I could do it.  But, MON DIEU, what shall I say?  Three</p>
<p>years now, he has pushed me, every one has pushed me, to fight.  And</p>
<p>you--but I cannot.  I am not capable of it.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl&#x27;s hand lay in his as cold and still as a stone.  She was</p>
<p>silent for a moment, and then asked, coldly, &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not?  Because of the old friendship.  Because he pulled me out</p>
<p>of the river long ago.  Because I am still his friend.  Because now</p>
<p>he hates me too much.  Because it would be a black fight.  Because</p>
<p>shame and evil would come of it, whoever won.  That is what I fear,</p>
<p>&#x27;Toinette!&quot;</p>
<p>Her hand slipped suddenly away from his.  She stepped back from the</p>
<p>gate.</p>
<p>&quot;TIENS!  You have fear, Monsieur Leclere!  Truly I had not thought</p>
<p>of that.  It is strange.  For so strong a man it is a little stupid</p>
<p>to be afraid.  Good-night.  I hear my father calling me.  Perhaps</p>
<p>some one in the store who wants to be served.  You must tell me</p>
<p>again what you are going to do with the new carriage.  Good-night!&quot;</p>
<p>She was laughing again.  But it was a different laughter.  Prosper,</p>
<p>at the gate, did not think it sounded like the running of a brook</p>
<p>over the stones.  No, it was more the noise of the dry branches that</p>
<p>knock together in the wind.  He did not hear the sigh that came as</p>
<p>she shut the door of the house, nor see how slowly she walked</p>
<p>through the passage into the store.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>There seemed to be a great many rainy Saturdays that spring; and in</p>
<p>the early summer the trade in Girard&#x27;s store was so brisk that it</p>
<p>appeared to need all the force of the establishment to attend to it.</p>
<p>The gate of the front yard had no more strain put upon its hinges.</p>
<p>It fell into a stiff propriety of opening and shutting, at the touch</p>
<p>of people who understood that a gate was made merely to pass</p>
<p>through, not to lean upon.</p>
<p>That summer Vaillantcoeur had a new hat--a black and shiny beaver--</p>
<p>and a new red-silk cravat.  They looked fine on Corpus Christi day,</p>
<p>when he and &#x27;Toinette walked together as fiancee&#x27;s.</p>
<p>You would have thought he would have been content with that.  Proud,</p>
<p>he certainly was.  He stepped like the cure&#x27;s big rooster with the</p>
<p>topknot--almost as far up in the air as he did along the ground; and</p>
<p>he held his chin high, as if he liked to look at things over his nose.</p>
<p>But he was not satisfied all the way through.  He thought more of</p>
<p>beating Prosper than of getting &#x27;Toinette.  And he was not quite</p>
<p>sure that he had beaten him yet.</p>
<p>Perhaps the girl still liked Prosper a little.  Perhaps she still</p>
<p>thought of his romances, and his chansons, and his fine, smooth</p>
<p>words, and missed them.  Perhaps she was too silent and dull</p>
<p>sometimes, when she walked with Raoul; and sometimes she laughed too</p>
<p>loud when he talked, more at him than with him.  Perhaps those St.</p>
<p>Raymond fellows still remembered the way his head stuck out of that</p>
<p>cursed snow-drift, and joked about it, and said how clever and quick</p>
<p>the little Prosper was.  Perhaps--ah, MAUDIT! a thousand times</p>
<p>perhaps!  And only one way to settle them, the old way, the sure</p>
<p>way, and all the better now because &#x27;Toinette must be on his side.</p>
<p>She must understand for sure that the bravest man in the parish had</p>
<p>chosen her.</p>
<p>That was the summer of the building of the grand stone tower of the</p>
<p>church.  The men of Abbeville did it themselves, with their own</p>
<p>hands, for the glory of God.  They were keen about that, and the</p>
<p>cure was the keenest of them all.  No sharing of that glory with</p>
<p>workmen from Quebec, if you please!  Abbeville was only forty years</p>
<p>old, but they already understood the glory of God quite as well</p>
<p>there as at Quebec, without doubt.  They could build their own</p>
<p>tower, perfectly, and they would.  Besides, it would cost less.</p>
<p>Vaillantcoeur was the chief carpenter.  He attended to the affair of</p>
<p>beams and timbers.  Leclere was the chief mason.  He directed the</p>
<p>affair of dressing the stones and laying them.  That required a very</p>
<p>careful head, you understand, for the tower must be straight.  In</p>
<p>the floor a little crookedness did not matter; but in the wall--that</p>
<p>might be serious.  People have been killed by a falling tower.  Of</p>
<p>course, if they were going into church, they would be sure of</p>
<p>heaven.  But then think--what a disgrace for Abbeville!</p>
<p>Every one was glad that Leclere bossed the raising of the tower.</p>
<p>They admitted that he might not be brave, but he was assuredly</p>
<p>careful.  Vaillantcoeur alone grumbled, and said the work went too</p>
<p>slowly, and even swore that the sockets for the beams were too</p>
<p>shallow, or else too deep, it made no difference which.  That BETE</p>
<p>Prosper made trouble always by his poor work.  But the friction</p>
<p>never came to a blaze; for the cure was pottering about the tower</p>
<p>every day and all day long, and a few words from him would make a</p>
<p>quarrel go off in smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Softly, my boys!&quot; he would say; &quot;work smooth and you work fast. The</p>
<p>logs in the river run well when they run all the same way.  But when</p>
<p>two logs cross each other, on the same rock--psst! a jam! The whole</p>
<p>drive is hung up!  Do not run crossways, my children.&quot;</p>
<p>The walls rose steadily, straight as a steamboat pipe--ten, twenty,</p>
<p>thirty, forty feet; it was time to put in the two cross-girders, lay</p>
<p>the floor of the belfry, finish off the stonework, and begin the</p>
<p>pointed wooden spire.  The cure had gone to Quebec that very day to</p>
<p>buy the shining plates of tin for the roof, and a beautiful cross of</p>
<p>gilt for the pinnacle.</p>
<p>Leclere was in front of the tower putting on his overalls.</p>
<p>Vaillantcoeur came up, swearing mad.  Three or four other workmen</p>
<p>were standing about.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here, you Leclere,&quot; said he, &quot;I tried one of the cross-girders</p>
<p>yesterday afternoon and it wouldn&#x27;t go.  The templet on the north is</p>
<p>crooked--crooked as your teeth.  We had to let the girder down</p>
<p>again.  I suppose we must trim it off some way, to get a level</p>
<p>bearing, and make the tower weak, just to match your sacre bad work,</p>
<p>eh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Prosper, pleasant and quiet enough, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry for</p>
<p>that, Raoul.  Perhaps I could put that templet straight, or perhaps</p>
<p>the girder might be a little warped and twisted, eh?  What?  Suppose</p>
<p>we measure it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sure enough, they found the long timber was not half seasoned and</p>
<p>had corkscrewed itself out of shape at least three inches.</p>
<p>Vaillantcoeur sat on the sill of the doorway and did not even look</p>
<p>at them while they were measuring.  When they called out to him what</p>
<p>they had found, he strode over to them.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a dam&#x27; lie,&quot; he said, sullenly.  &quot;Prosper Leclere, you slipped</p>
<p>the string.  None of your sacre cheating!  I have enough of it</p>
<p>already.  Will you fight, you cursed sneak?&quot;</p>
<p>Prosper&#x27;s face went gray, like the mortar in the trough.  His fists</p>
<p>clenched and the cords on his neck stood out as if they were ropes.</p>
<p>He breathed hard.  But he only said three words:</p>
<p>&quot;No!  Not here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not here?  Why not?  There is room.  The cure is away.  Why not</p>
<p>here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is the house of LE BON DIEU.  Can we build it in hate?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;POLISSON!  You make an excuse.  Then come to Girard&#x27;s, and fight</p>
<p>there.&quot;</p>
<p>Again Prosper held in for a moment, and spoke three words:</p>
<p>&quot;No!  Not now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not now?  But when, you heart of a hare?  Will you sneak out of it</p>
<p>until you turn gray and die?  When will you fight, little musk-rat?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When I have forgotten.  When I am no more your friend.&quot;</p>
<p>Prosper picked up his trowel and went into the tower.  Raoul bad-</p>
<p>worded him and every stone of his building from foundation to</p>
<p>cornice, and then went down the road to get a bottle of cognac.</p>
<p>An hour later he came back breathing out threatenings and slaughter,</p>
<p>strongly flavoured with raw spirits.  Prosper was working quietly on</p>
<p>the top of the tower, at the side away from the road.  He saw</p>
<p>nothing until Raoul, climbing up by the ladders on the inside,</p>
<p>leaped on the platform and rushed at him like a crazy lynx.</p>
<p>&quot;Now!&quot; he cried, &quot;no hole to hide in here, rat!  I&#x27;ll squeeze the</p>
<p>lies out of you.&quot;</p>
<p>He gripped Prosper by the head, thrusting one thumb into his eye,</p>
<p>and pushing him backward on the scaffolding.</p>
<p>Blinded, half maddened by the pain, Prosper thought of nothing but</p>
<p>to get free.  He swung his long arm upward and landed a heavy blow</p>
<p>on Raoul&#x27;s face that dislocated the jaw; then twisting himself</p>
<p>downward and sideways, he fell in toward the wall.  Raoul plunged</p>
<p>forward, stumbled, let go his hold, and pitched out from the tower,</p>
<p>arms spread, clutching the air.</p>
<p>Forty feet straight down!  A moment--or was it an eternity?--of</p>
<p>horrible silence.  Then the body struck the rough stones at the foot</p>
<p>of the tower with a thick, soft dunt, and lay crumpled up among</p>
<p>them, without a groan, without a movement.</p>
<p>When the other men, who had hurried up the ladders in terror, found</p>
<p>Leclere, he was peering over the edge of the scaffold, wiping the</p>
<p>blood from his eyes, trying to see down.</p>
<p>&quot;I have killed him,&quot; he muttered, &quot;my friend!  He is smashed to</p>
<p>death.  I am a murderer.  Let me go.  I must throw myself down!&quot;</p>
<p>They had hard work to hold him back.  As they forced him down the</p>
<p>ladders he trembled like a poplar.</p>
<p>But Vaillantcoeur was not dead.  No; it was incredible--to fall</p>
<p>forty feet and not be killed--they talk of it yet all through the</p>
<p>valley of the Lake St. John--it was a miracle!  But Vaillantcoeur</p>
<p>had broken only a nose, a collar-bone, and two ribs--for one like</p>
<p>him that was but a bagatelle.  A good doctor from Chicoutimi, a few</p>
<p>months of nursing, and he would be on his feet again, almost as good</p>
<p>a man as he had ever been.</p>
<p>It was Leclere who put himself in charge of this.</p>
<p>&quot;It is my affair,&quot; he said--&quot;my fault!  It was not a fair place to</p>
<p>fight.  Why did I strike?  I must attend to this bad work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;MAIS, SACRE BLEU!&quot; they answered, &quot;how could you help it?  He</p>
<p>forced you.  You did not want to be killed.  That would be a little</p>
<p>too much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; he persisted, &quot;this is my affair.  Girard, you know my money</p>
<p>is with the notary.  There is plenty.  Raoul has not enough, perhaps</p>
<p>not any.  But he shall want nothing--you understand--nothing!  It is</p>
<p>my affair, all that he needs--but you shall not tell him--no!  That</p>
<p>is all.&quot;</p>
<p>Prosper had his way.  But he did not see Vaillantcoeur after he was</p>
<p>carried home and put to bed in his cabin.  Even if he had tried to</p>
<p>do so, it would have been impossible.  He could not see anybody.</p>
<p>One of his eyes was entirely destroyed.  The inflammation spread to</p>
<p>the other, and all through the autumn he lay in his house, drifting</p>
<p>along the edge of blindness, while Raoul lay in his house slowly</p>
<p>getting well.</p>
<p>The cure went from one house to the other, but he did not carry any</p>
<p>messages between them.  If any were sent one way they were not</p>
<p>received.  And the other way, none were sent.  Raoul did not speak</p>
<p>of Prosper; and if one mentioned his name, Raoul shut his mouth and</p>
<p>made no answer.</p>
<p>To the cure, of course, it was a distress and a misery.  To have a</p>
<p>hatred like this unhealed, was a blot on the parish; it was a shame,</p>
<p>as well as a sin.  At last--it was already winter, the day before</p>
<p>Christmas--the cure made up his mind that he would put forth one</p>
<p>more great effort.</p>
<p>&quot;Look you, my son,&quot; he said to Prosper, &quot;I am going this afternoon</p>
<p>to Raoul Vaillantcoeur to make the reconciliation.  You shall give</p>
<p>me a word to carry to him.  He shall hear it this time, I promise</p>
<p>you.  Shall I tell him what you have done for him, how you have</p>
<p>cared for him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, never,&quot; said Prosper; &quot;you shall not take that word from me.</p>
<p>It is nothing.  It will make worse trouble.  I will never send it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What then?&quot; said the priest. &quot;Shall I tell him that you forgive</p>
<p>him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not that,&quot; answered Prosper, &quot;that would be a foolish word.</p>
<p>What would that mean?  It is not I who can forgive.  I was the one</p>
<p>who struck hardest.  It was he that fell from the tower.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, choose the word for yourself.  What shall it be?  Come,</p>
<p>I promise you that he shall hear it.  I will take with me the</p>
<p>notary, and the good man Girard, and the little Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>You shall hear an answer.  What message?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mon pere,&quot; said Prosper, slowly, &quot;you shall tell him just this.  I,</p>
<p>Prosper Leclere, ask Raoul Vaillantcoeur that he will forgive me for</p>
<p>not fighting with him on the ground when he demanded it.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, the message was given in precisely those words.  Marie</p>
<p>Antoinette stood within the door, Bergeron and Girard at the foot of</p>
<p>the bed, and the cure spoke very clearly and firmly.  Vaillantcoeur</p>
<p>rolled on his pillow and turned his face away.  Then he sat up in</p>
<p>bed, grunting a little with the pain in his shoulder, which was</p>
<p>badly set.  His black eyes snapped like the eyes of a wolverine in a</p>
<p>corner.</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive?&quot; he said, &quot;no, never.  He is a coward.  I will never</p>
<p>forgive!&quot;</p>
<p>A little later in the afternoon, when the rose of sunset lay on the</p>
<p>snowy hills, some one knocked at the door of Leclere&#x27;s house.</p>
<p>&quot;ENTREZ!&quot; he cried.  &quot;Who is there?  I see not very well by this</p>
<p>light.  Who is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is me, said &#x27;Toinette, her cheeks rosier than the snow outside,</p>
<p>&quot;nobody but me.  I have come to ask you to tell me the rest about</p>
<p>that new carriage--do you remember?&quot;</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The voice in the canoe behind me ceased.  The rain let up.  The</p>
<p>SLISH, SLISH of the paddle stopped.  The canoe swung sideways to the</p>
<p>breeze.  I heard the RAP, RAP, RAP of a pipe on the gunwale, and the</p>
<p>quick scratch of a match on the under side of the thwart.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing, Ferdinand?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I go to light the pipe, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is the story finished?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But yes--but no--I know not, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;.  As you will.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what did old Girard say when his daughter broke her engagement</p>
<p>and married a man whose eyes were spoiled?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He said that Leclere could see well enough to work with him in the</p>
<p>store.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what did Vaillantcoeur say when he lost his girl?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He said it was a cursed shame that one could not fight a blind</p>
<p>man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what did &#x27;Toinette say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She said she had chosen the bravest heart in Abbeville.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And Prosper--what did he say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;M&#x27;sieu&#x27;, I know not.  He said it only to &#x27;Toinette.&quot;</p>
<p>THE GENTLE LIFE</p>
<p>Do you remember that fair little wood of silver birches on the West</p>
<p>Branch of the Neversink, somewhat below the place where the Biscuit</p>
<p>Brook runs in?  There is a mossy terrace raised a couple of feet</p>
<p>above the water of a long, still pool; and a very pleasant spot for</p>
<p>a friendship-fire on the shingly beach below you; and a plenty of</p>
<p>painted trilliums and yellow violets and white foam-flowers to adorn</p>
<p>your woodland banquet, if it be spread in the month of May, when</p>
<p>Mistress Nature is given over to embroidery.</p>
<p>It was there, at Contentment Corner, that Ned Mason had promised to</p>
<p>meet me on a certain day for the noontide lunch and smoke and talk,</p>
<p>he fishing down Biscuit Brook, and I down the West Branch, until we</p>
<p>came together at the rendezvous.  But he was late that day--good old</p>
<p>Ned!  He was occasionally behind time on a trout stream.  For he</p>
<p>went about his fishing very seriously; and if it was fine, the sport</p>
<p>was a natural occasion of delay.  But if it was poor, he made it an</p>
<p>occasion to sit down to meditate upon the cause of his failure, and</p>
<p>tried to overcome it with many subtly reasoned changes of the fly--</p>
<p>which is a vain thing to do, but well adapted to make one forgetful</p>
<p>of the flight of time.</p>
<p>So I waited for him near an hour, and then ate my half of the</p>
<p>sandwiches and boiled eggs, smoked a solitary pipe, and fell into a</p>
<p>light sleep at the foot of the biggest birch tree, an old and trusty</p>
<p>friend of mine.  It seemed like a very slight sound that roused me:</p>
<p>the snapping of a dry twig in the thicket, or a gentle splash in the</p>
<p>water, differing in some indefinable way from the steady murmur of</p>
<p>the stream; something it was, I knew not what, that made me aware of</p>
<p>some one coming down the brook.  I raised myself quietly on one</p>
<p>elbow and looked up through the trees to the head of the pool.  &quot;Ned</p>
<p>will think that I have gone down long ago,&quot; I said to myself; &quot;I</p>
<p>will just lie here and watch him fish through this pool, and see how</p>
<p>he manages to spend so much time about it.&quot;</p>
<p>But it was not Ned&#x27;s rod that I saw poking out through the bushes at</p>
<p>the bend in the brook.  It was such an affair as I had never seen</p>
<p>before upon a trout stream: a majestic weapon at least sixteen feet</p>
<p>long, made in two pieces, neatly spliced together in the middle, and</p>
<p>all painted a smooth, glistening, hopeful green.  The line that hung</p>
<p>from the tip of it was also green, but of a paler, more transparent</p>
<p>colour, quite thick and stiff where it left the rod, but tapering</p>
<p>down towards the end, as if it were twisted of strands of horse-</p>
<p>hair, reduced in number, until, at the hook, there were but two</p>
<p>hairs.  And the hook--there was no disguise about that--it was an</p>
<p>unabashed bait-hook, and well baited, too.  Gently the line swayed</p>
<p>to and fro above the foaming water at the head of the pool; quietly</p>
<p>the bait settled down in the foam and ran with the current around</p>
<p>the edge of the deep eddy under the opposite bank; suddenly the line</p>
<p>straightened and tautened; sharply the tip of the long green rod</p>
<p>sprang upward, and the fisherman stepped out from the bushes to play</p>
<p>his fish.</p>
<p>Where had I seen such a figure before?  The dress was strange and</p>
<p>quaint--broad, low shoes, gray woollen stockings, short brown</p>
<p>breeches tied at the knee with ribbons, a loose brown coat belted at</p>
<p>the waist like a Norfolk jacket; a wide, rolling collar with a bit</p>
<p>of lace at the edge, and a soft felt hat with a shady brim.  It was</p>
<p>a costume that, with all its oddity, seemed wonderfully fit and</p>
<p>familiar.  And the face?  Certainly it was the face of an old</p>
<p>friend.  Never had I seen a countenance of more quietness and</p>
<p>kindliness and twinkling good humour.</p>
<p>&quot;Well met, sir, and a pleasant day to you,&quot; cried the angler, as his</p>
<p>eyes lighted on me.  &quot;Look you, I have hold of a good fish; I pray</p>
<p>you put that net under him, and touch not my line, for if you do,</p>
<p>then we break all.  Well done, sir; I thank you.  Now we have him</p>
<p>safely landed.  Truly this is a lovely one; the best that I have</p>
<p>taken in these waters.  See how the belly shines, here as yellow as</p>
<p>a marsh-marigold, and there as white as a foam-flower.  Is not the</p>
<p>hand of Divine Wisdom as skilful in the colouring of a fish as in</p>
<p>the painting of the manifold blossoms that sweeten these wild</p>
<p>forests?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed it is,&quot; said I, &quot;and this is the biggest trout that I have</p>
<p>seen caught in the upper waters of the Neversink.  It is certainly</p>
<p>eighteen inches long, and should weigh close upon two pounds and a</p>
<p>half.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More than that,&quot; he answered, &quot;if I mistake not.  But I observe</p>
<p>that you call it a trout.  To my mind, it seems more like a char, as</p>
<p>do all the fish that I have caught in your stream.  Look here upon</p>
<p>these curious water-markings that run through the dark green of the</p>
<p>back, and these enamellings of blue and gold upon the side.  Note,</p>
<p>moreover, how bright and how many are the red spots, and how each</p>
<p>one of them is encircled with a ring of purple.  Truly it is a fish</p>
<p>of rare beauty, and of high esteem with persons of note.  I would</p>
<p>gladly know if it he as good to the taste as I have heard it reputed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is even better,&quot; I replied; &quot;as you shall find, if you will but</p>
<p>try it.&quot;</p>
<p>Then a curious impulse came to me, to which I yielded with as little</p>
<p>hesitation or misgiving, at the time, as if it were the most natural</p>
<p>thing in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;You seem a stranger in this part of the country, sir,&quot; said I; &quot;but</p>
<p>unless I am mistaken you are no stranger to me.  Did you not use to</p>
<p>go a-fishing in the New River, with honest Nat. and R. Roe, many</p>
<p>years ago?  And did they not call you Izaak Walton?&quot;</p>
<p>His eyes smiled pleasantly at me and a little curve of merriment</p>
<p>played around his lips.  &quot;It is a secret which I thought not to have</p>
<p>been discovered here,&quot; he said; &quot;but since you have lit upon it, I</p>
<p>will not deny it.&quot;</p>
<p>Now how it came to pass that I was not astonished nor dismayed at</p>
<p>this, I cannot explain.  But so it was; and the only feeling of</p>
<p>which I was conscious was a strong desire to detain this visitor as</p>
<p>long as possible, and have some talk with him.  So I grasped at the</p>
<p>only expedient that flashed into my mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, sir,&quot; I said, &quot;you are most heartily welcome, and I</p>
<p>trust you will not despise the only hospitality I have to offer.  If</p>
<p>you will sit down here among these birch trees in Contentment</p>
<p>Corner, I will give you half of a fisherman&#x27;s luncheon, and will</p>
<p>cook your char for you on a board before an open wood-fire, if you</p>
<p>are not in a hurry.  Though I belong to a nation which is reported</p>
<p>to be curious, I will promise to trouble you with no inquisitive</p>
<p>questions; and if you will but talk to me at your will, you shall</p>
<p>find me a ready listener.&quot;</p>
<p>So we made ourselves comfortable on the shady bank, and while I</p>
<p>busied myself in splitting the fish and pinning it open on a bit of</p>
<p>board that I had found in a pile of driftwood, and setting it up</p>
<p>before the fire to broil, my new companion entertained me with the</p>
<p>sweetest and friendliest talk that I had ever heard.</p>
<p>&quot;To speak without offence, sir,&quot; he began, &quot;there was a word in your</p>
<p>discourse a moment ago that seemed strange to me.  You spoke of</p>
<p>being &#x27;in a hurry&#x27;; and that is an expression which is unfamiliar to</p>
<p>my ears; but if it mean the same as being in haste, then I must tell</p>
<p>you that this is a thing which, in my judgment, honest anglers</p>
<p>should learn to forget, and have no dealings with it.  To be in</p>
<p>haste is to be in anxiety and distress of mind; it is to mistrust</p>
<p>Providence, and to doubt that the issue of all events is in wiser</p>
<p>hands than ours; it is to disturb the course of nature, and put</p>
<p>overmuch confidence in the importance of our own endeavours.</p>
<p>&quot;For how much of the evil that is in the world cometh from this</p>
<p>plaguy habit of being in haste!  The haste to get riches, the haste</p>
<p>to climb upon some pinnacle of worldly renown, the haste to resolve</p>
<p>mysteries--from these various kinds of haste are begotten no small</p>
<p>part of the miseries and afflictions whereby the children of men are</p>
<p>tormented: such as quarrels and strifes among those who would over-</p>
<p>reach one another in business; envyings and jealousies among those</p>
<p>who would outshine one another in rich apparel and costly equipage;</p>
<p>bloody rebellions and cruel wars among those who would obtain power</p>
<p>over their fellow-men; cloudy disputations and bitter controversies</p>
<p>among those who would fain leave no room for modest ignorance and</p>
<p>lowly faith among the secrets of religion; and by all these miseries</p>
<p>of haste the heart grows weary, and is made weak and dull, or else</p>
<p>hard and angry, while it dwelleth in the midst of them.</p>
<p>&quot;But let me tell you that an angler&#x27;s occupation is a good cure for</p>
<p>these evils, if for no other reason, because it gently dissuadeth us</p>
<p>from haste and leadeth us away from feverish anxieties into those</p>
<p>ways which are pleasantness and those paths which are peace.  For an</p>
<p>angler cannot force his fortune by eagerness, nor better it by</p>
<p>discontent.  He must wait upon the weather, and the height of the</p>
<p>water, and the hunger of the fish, and many other accidents of which</p>
<p>he has no control.  If he would angle well, he must not be in haste.</p>
<p>And if he be in haste, he will do well to unlearn it by angling, for</p>
<p>I think there is no surer method.</p>
<p>&quot;This fair tree that shadows us from the sun hath grown many years</p>
<p>in its place without more unhappiness than the loss of its leaves in</p>
<p>winter, which the succeeding season doth generously repair; and</p>
<p>shall we be less contented in the place where God hath planted us?</p>
<p>or shall there go less time to the making of a man than to the</p>
<p>growth of a tree?  This stream floweth wimpling and laughing down to</p>
<p>the great sea which it knoweth not; yet it doth not fret because the</p>
<p>future is hidden; and doubtless it were wise in us to accept the</p>
<p>mysteries of life as cheerfully and go forward with a merry heart,</p>
<p>considering that we know enough to make us happy and keep us honest</p>
<p>for to-day.  A man should be well content if he can see so far ahead</p>
<p>of him as the next bend in the stream.  What lies beyond, let him</p>
<p>trust in the hand of God.</p>
<p>&quot;But as concerning riches, wherein should you and I be happier, this</p>
<p>pleasant afternoon of May, had we all the gold in Croesus his</p>
<p>coffers?  Would the sun shine for us more bravely, or the flowers</p>
<p>give forth a sweeter breath, or yonder warbling vireo, hidden in her</p>
<p>leafy choir, send down more pure and musical descants, sweetly</p>
<p>attuned by natural magic to woo and win our thoughts from vanity and</p>
<p>hot desires into a harmony with the tranquil thoughts of God?  And</p>
<p>as for fame and power, trust me, sir, I have seen too many men in my</p>
<p>time that lived very unhappily though their names were upon all</p>
<p>lips, and died very sadly though their power was felt in many lands;</p>
<p>too many of these great ones have I seen that spent their days in</p>
<p>disquietude and ended them in sorrow, to make me envy their</p>
<p>conditions or hasten to rival them.  Nor do I think that, by all</p>
<p>their perturbations and fightings and runnings to and fro, the world</p>
<p>hath been much bettered, or even greatly changed.  The colour and</p>
<p>complexion of mortal life, in all things that are essential, remain</p>
<p>the same under Cromwell or under Charles.  The goodness and mercy of</p>
<p>God are still over all His works, whether Presbytery or Episcopacy</p>
<p>be set up as His interpreter.  Very quietly and peacefully have I</p>
<p>lived under several polities, civil and ecclesiastical, and under</p>
<p>all there was room enough to do my duty and love my friends and go</p>
<p>a-fishing.  And let me tell you, sir, that in the state wherein I</p>
<p>now find myself, though there are many things of which I may not</p>
<p>speak to you, yet one thing is clear: if I had made haste in my</p>
<p>mortal concerns, I should not have saved time, but lost it; for all</p>
<p>our affairs are under one sure dominion which moveth them forward to</p>
<p>their concordant end: wherefore &#x27;HE THAT BELIEVETH SHALL NOT MAKE</p>
<p>HASTE,&#x27; and, above all, not when he goeth a-angling.</p>
<p>&quot;But tell me, I pray you, is not this char cooked yet?  Methinks the</p>
<p>time is somewhat overlong for the roasting.  The fragrant smell of</p>
<p>the cookery gives me an eagerness to taste this new dish.  Not that</p>
<p>I am in haste, but--</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it is done; and well done, too!  Marry, the flesh of this</p>
<p>fish is as red as rose-leaves, and as sweet as if he had fed on</p>
<p>nothing else.  The flavour of smoke from the fire is but slight, and</p>
<p>it takes nothing from the perfection of the dish, but rather adds to</p>
<p>it, being clean and delicate.  I like not these French cooks who</p>
<p>make all dishes in disguise, and set them forth with strange foreign</p>
<p>savours, like a masquerade.  Give me my food in its native dress,</p>
<p>even though it be a little dry.  If we had but a cup of sack, now,</p>
<p>or a glass of good ale, and a pipeful of tobacco?</p>
<p>&quot;What! you have an abundance of the fragrant weed in your pouch?</p>
<p>Sir, I thank you very heartily!  You entertain me like a prince.</p>
<p>Not like King James, be it understood, who despised tobacco and</p>
<p>called it a &#x27;lively image and pattern of hell&#x27;; nor like the Czar of</p>
<p>Russia who commanded that all who used it should have their noses</p>
<p>cut off; but like good Queen Bess of glorious memory, who disdained</p>
<p>not the incense of the pipe, and some say she used one herself;</p>
<p>though for my part I think the custom of smoking one that is more</p>
<p>fitting for men, whose frailty and need of comfort are well known,</p>
<p>than for that fairer sex whose innocent and virgin spirits stand</p>
<p>less in want of creature consolations.</p>
<p>&quot;But come, let us not trouble our enjoyment with careful</p>
<p>discrimination of others&#x27; scruples.  Your tobacco is rarely good;</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll warrant it comes from that province of Virginia which was named</p>
<p>for the Virgin Queen; and while we smoke together, let me call you,</p>
<p>for this hour, my Scholar; and so I will give you four choice rules</p>
<p>for the attainment of that unhastened quietude of mind whereof we</p>
<p>did lately discourse.</p>
<p>&quot;First: you shall learn to desire nothing in the world so much but</p>
<p>that you can be happy without it.</p>
<p>&quot;Second: you shall seek that which you desire only by such means as</p>
<p>are fair and lawful, and this will leave you without bitterness</p>
<p>towards men or shame before God.</p>
<p>&quot;Third: you shall take pleasure in the time while you are seeking,</p>
<p>even though you obtain not immediately that which you seek; for the</p>
<p>purpose of a journey is not only to arrive at the goal, but also to</p>
<p>find enjoyment by the way.</p>
<p>&quot;Fourth: when you attain that which you have desired, you shall</p>
<p>think more of the kindness of your fortune than of the greatness of</p>
<p>your skill.  This will make you grateful, and ready to share with</p>
<p>others that which Providence hath bestowed upon you; and truly this</p>
<p>is both reasonable and profitable, for it is but little that any of</p>
<p>us would catch in this world were not our luck better than our</p>
<p>deserts.</p>
<p>&quot;And to these Four Rules I will add yet another--Fifth: when you</p>
<p>smoke your pipe with a good conscience, trouble not yourself because</p>
<p>there are men in the world who will find fault with you for so</p>
<p>doing.  If you wait for a pleasure at which no sour-complexioned</p>
<p>soul hath ever girded, you will wait long, and go through life with</p>
<p>a sad and anxious mind.  But I think that God is best pleased with</p>
<p>us when we give little heed to scoffers, and enjoy His gifts with</p>
<p>thankfulness and an easy heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, Scholar, I have almost tired myself, and, I fear, more than</p>
<p>almost tired you.  But this pipe is nearly burned out, and the few</p>
<p>short whiffs that are left in it shall put a period to my too long</p>
<p>discourse.  Let me tell you, then, that there be some men in the</p>
<p>world who hold not with these my opinions.  They profess that a life</p>
<p>of contention and noise and public turmoil, is far higher than a</p>
<p>life of quiet work and meditation.  And so far as they follow their</p>
<p>own choice honestly and with a pure mind, I doubt not that it is as</p>
<p>good for them as mine is for me, and I am well pleased that every</p>
<p>man do enjoy his own opinion.  But so far as they have spoken ill of</p>
<p>me and my opinions, I do hold it a thing of little consequence,</p>
<p>except that I am sorry that they have thereby embittered their own</p>
<p>hearts.</p>
<p>&quot;For this is the punishment of men who malign and revile those that</p>
<p>differ from them in religion, or prefer another way of living; their</p>
<p>revilings, by so much as they spend their wit and labour to make</p>
<p>them shrewd and bitter, do draw all the sweet and wholesome sap out</p>
<p>of their lives and turn it into poison; and so they become vessels</p>
<p>of mockery and wrath, remembered chiefly for the evil things that</p>
<p>they have said with cleverness.</p>
<p>&quot;For be sure of this, Scholar, the more a man giveth himself to</p>
<p>hatred in this world, the more will he find to hate.  But let us</p>
<p>rather give ourselves to charity, and if we have enemies (and what</p>
<p>honest man hath them not?) let them be ours, since they must, but</p>
<p>let us not be theirs, since we know better.</p>
<p>&quot;There was one Franck, a trooper of Cromwell&#x27;s, who wrote ill of me,</p>
<p>saying that I neither understood the subjects whereof I discoursed</p>
<p>nor believed the things that I said, being both silly and</p>
<p>pretentious.  It would have been a pity if it had been true.  There</p>
<p>was also one Leigh Hunt, a maker of many books, who used one day a</p>
<p>bottle of ink whereof the gall was transfused into his blood, so</p>
<p>that he wrote many hard words of me, setting forth selfishness and</p>
<p>cruelty and hypocrisy as if they were qualities of my disposition.</p>
<p>God knew, even then, whether these things were true of me; and if</p>
<p>they were not true, it would have been a pity to have answered them;</p>
<p>but it would have been still more a pity to be angered by them.  But</p>
<p>since that time Master Hunt and I have met each other; yes, and</p>
<p>Master Franck, too; and we have come very happily to a better</p>
<p>understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;Trust me, Scholar, it is the part of wisdom to spend little of your</p>
<p>time upon the things that vex and anger you, and much of your time</p>
<p>upon the things that bring you quietness and confidence and good</p>
<p>cheer.  A friend made is better than an enemy punished.  There is</p>
<p>more of God in the peaceable beauty of this little wood-violet than</p>
<p>in all the angry disputations of the sects.  We are nearer heaven</p>
<p>when we listen to the birds than when we quarrel with our fellow-</p>
<p>men.  I am sure that none can enter into the spirit of Christ, his</p>
<p>evangel, save those who willingly follow his invitation when he</p>
<p>says, &#x27;COME YE YOURSELVES APART INTO A LONELY P1ACE, AND REST A</p>
<p>WHILE.&#x27;  For since his blessed kingdom was first established in the</p>
<p>green fields, by the lakeside, with humble fishermen for its</p>
<p>subjects, the easiest way into it hath ever been through the wicket-</p>
<p>gate of a lowly and grateful fellowship with nature.  He that feels</p>
<p>not the beauty and blessedness and peace of the woods and meadows</p>
<p>that God hath bedecked with flowers for him even while he is yet a</p>
<p>sinner, how shall he learn to enjoy the unfading bloom of the</p>
<p>celestial country if he ever become a saint?</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, sir, he that departeth out of this world without perceiving</p>
<p>that it is fair and full of innocent sweetness hath done little</p>
<p>honour to the every-day miracles of divine beneficence; and though</p>
<p>by mercy he may obtain an entrance to heaven, it will be a strange</p>
<p>place to him; and though he have studied all that is written in</p>
<p>men&#x27;s books of divinity, yet because he hath left the book of Nature</p>
<p>unturned, he will have much to learn and much to forget.  Do you</p>
<p>think that to be blind to the beauties of earth prepareth the heart</p>
<p>to behold the glories of heaven?  Nay, Scholar, I know that you are</p>
<p>not of that opinion.  But I can tell you another thing which perhaps</p>
<p>you knew not.  The heart that is blest with the glories of heaven</p>
<p>ceaseth not to remember and to love the beauties of this world.  And</p>
<p>of this love I am certain, because I feel it, and glad because it is</p>
<p>a great blessing.</p>
<p>&quot;There are two sorts of seeds sown in our remembrance by what we</p>
<p>call the hand of fortune, the fruits of which do not wither, but</p>
<p>grow sweeter forever and ever.  The first is the seed of innocent</p>
<p>pleasures, received in gratitude and enjoyed with good companions,</p>
<p>of which pleasures we never grow weary of thinking, because they</p>
<p>have enriched our hearts.  The second is the seed of pure and gentle</p>
<p>sorrows, borne in submission and with faithful love, and these also</p>
<p>we never forget, but we come to cherish them with gladness instead</p>
<p>of grief, because we see them changed into everlasting joys.  And</p>
<p>how this may be I cannot tell you now, for you would not understand</p>
<p>me.  But that it is so, believe me: for if you believe, you shall</p>
<p>one day see it yourself.</p>
<p>&quot;But come, now, our friendly pipes are long since burned out.  Hark,</p>
<p>how sweetly the tawny thrush in yonder thicket touches her silver</p>
<p>harp for the evening hymn!  I will follow the stream downward, but</p>
<p>do you tarry here until the friend comes for whom you were waiting.</p>
<p>I think we shall all three meet one another, somewhere, after sunset.&quot;</p>
<p>I watched the gray hat and the old brown coat and long green rod</p>
<p>disappear among the trees around the curve of the stream.  Then</p>
<p>Ned&#x27;s voice sounded in my ears, and I saw him standing above me</p>
<p>laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Hallo, old man,&quot; he said, &quot;you&#x27;re a sound sleeper!  I hope you&#x27;ve</p>
<p>had good luck, and pleasant dreams.&quot;</p>
<p>A FRIEND OF JUSTICE</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>It was the black patch over his left eye that made all the trouble.</p>
<p>In reality he was of a disposition most peaceful and propitiating, a</p>
<p>friend of justice and fair dealing, strongly inclined to a domestic</p>
<p>life, and capable of extreme devotion.  He had a vivid sense of</p>
<p>righteousness, it is true, and any violation of it was apt to heat</p>
<p>his indignation to the boiling-point.  When this occurred he was</p>
<p>strong in the back, stiff in the neck, and fearless of consequences.</p>
<p>But he was always open to friendly overtures and ready to make peace</p>
<p>with honour.</p>
<p>Singularly responsive to every touch of kindness, desirous of</p>
<p>affection, secretly hungry for caresses, he had a heart framed for</p>
<p>love and tranquillity.  But nature saw fit to put a black patch over</p>
<p>his left eye; wherefore his days were passed in the midst of</p>
<p>conflict and he lived the strenuous life.</p>
<p>How this sinister mark came to him, he never knew.  Indeed it is not</p>
<p>likely that he had any idea of the part that it played in his</p>
<p>career.  The attitude that the world took toward him from the</p>
<p>beginning, an attitude of aggressive mistrust,--the role that he was</p>
<p>expected and practically forced to assume in the drama of existence,</p>
<p>the role of a hero of interminable strife,--must have seemed to him</p>
<p>altogether mysterious and somewhat absurd.  But his part was fixed</p>
<p>by the black patch.  It gave him an aspect so truculent and</p>
<p>forbidding that all the elements of warfare gathered around him as</p>
<p>hornets around a sugar barrel, and his appearance in public was like</p>
<p>the raising of a flag for battle.</p>
<p>&quot;You see that Pichou,&quot; said MacIntosh, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay agent at</p>
<p>Mingan, &quot;you see yon big black-eye deevil?  The savages call him</p>
<p>Pichou because he&#x27;s ugly as a lynx--&#x27;LAID COMME UN PICHOU.&#x27;  Best</p>
<p>sledge-dog and the gurliest tyke on the North Shore.  Only two years</p>
<p>old and he can lead a team already.  But, man, he&#x27;s just daft for</p>
<p>the fighting.  Fought his mother when he was a pup and lamed her for</p>
<p>life.  Fought two of his brothers and nigh killed &#x27;em both.  Every</p>
<p>dog in the place has a grudge at him, and hell&#x27;s loose as oft as he</p>
<p>takes a walk.  I&#x27;m loath to part with him, but I&#x27;ll be selling him</p>
<p>gladly for fifty dollars to any man that wants a good sledge-dog,</p>
<p>eh?--and a bit collie-shangie every week.&quot;</p>
<p>Pichou had heard his name, and came trotting up to the corner of the</p>
<p>store where MacIntosh was talking with old Grant the chief factor,</p>
<p>who was on a tour of inspection along the North Shore, and Dan</p>
<p>Scott, the agent from Seven Islands, who had brought the chief down</p>
<p>in his chaloupe.  Pichou did not understand what his master had been</p>
<p>saying about him: but he thought he was called, and he had a sense</p>
<p>of duty; and besides, he was wishful to show proper courtesy to</p>
<p>well-dressed and respectable strangers.  He was a great dog, thirty</p>
<p>inches high at the shoulder; broad-chested, with straight, sinewy</p>
<p>legs; and covered with thick, wavy, cream-coloured hair from the</p>
<p>tips of his short ears to the end of his bushy tail--all except the</p>
<p>left side of his face.  That was black from ear to nose--coal-black;</p>
<p>and in the centre of this storm-cloud his eye gleamed like fire.</p>
<p>What did Pichou know about that ominous sign?  No one had ever told</p>
<p>him.  He had no looking-glass.  He ran up to the porch where the men</p>
<p>were sitting, as innocent as a Sunday-school scholar coming to the</p>
<p>superintendent&#x27;s desk to receive a prize.  But when old Grant, who</p>
<p>had grown pursy and nervous from long living on the fat of the land</p>
<p>at Ottawa, saw the black patch and the gleaming eye, he anticipated</p>
<p>evil; so he hitched one foot up on the porch, crying &quot;Get out!&quot; and</p>
<p>with the other foot he planted a kick on the side of the dog&#x27;s head.</p>
<p>Pichou&#x27;s nerve-centres had not been shaken by high living.  They</p>
<p>acted with absolute precision and without a tremor.  His sense of</p>
<p>justice was automatic, and his teeth were fixed through the leg of</p>
<p>the chief factor&#x27;s boot, just below the calf.</p>
<p>For two minutes there was a small chaos in the post of the</p>
<p>Honourable Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Mingan.  Grant howled bloody</p>
<p>murder; MacIntosh swore in three languages and yelled for his dog-</p>
<p>whip; three Indians and two French-Canadians wielded sticks and</p>
<p>fence-pickets.  But order did not arrive until Dan Scott knocked the</p>
<p>burning embers from his big pipe on the end of the dog&#x27;s nose.</p>
<p>Pichou gasped, let go his grip, shook his head, and loped back to</p>
<p>his quarters behind the barn, bruised, blistered, and intolerably</p>
<p>perplexed by the mystery of life.</p>
<p>As he lay on the sand, licking his wounds, he remembered many</p>
<p>strange things.  First of all, there was the trouble with his mother</p>
<p>She was a Labrador Husky, dirty yellowish gray, with bristling neck,</p>
<p>sharp fangs, and green eyes, like a wolf.  Her name was Babette.</p>
<p>She had a fiendish temper, but no courage.  His father was supposed</p>
<p>to be a huge black and white Newfoundland that came over in a</p>
<p>schooner from Miquelon.  Perhaps it was from him that the black</p>
<p>patch was inherited.  And perhaps there were other things in the</p>
<p>inheritance, too, which came from this nobler strain of blood</p>
<p>Pichon&#x27;s unwillingness to howl with the other dogs when they made</p>
<p>night hideous; his silent, dignified ways; his sense of fair play;</p>
<p>his love of the water; his longing for human society and friendship.</p>
<p>But all this was beyond Pichou&#x27;s horizon, though it was within his</p>
<p>nature.  He remembered only that Babette had taken a hate for him,</p>
<p>almost from the first, and had always treated him worse than his</p>
<p>all-yellow brothers.  She would have starved him if she could.  Once</p>
<p>when he was half grown, she fell upon him for some small offence and</p>
<p>tried to throttle him.  The rest of the pack looked on snarling and</p>
<p>slavering.  He caught Babette by the fore-leg and broke the bone.</p>
<p>She hobbled away, shrieking.  What else could he do?  Must a dog let</p>
<p>himself be killed by his mother?</p>
<p>As for his brothers--was it fair that two of them should fall foul</p>
<p>of him about the rabbit which he had tracked and caught and killed?</p>
<p>He would have shared it with them, if they had asked him, for they</p>
<p>ran behind him on the trail.  But when they both set their teeth in</p>
<p>his neck, there was nothing to do but to lay them both out: which he</p>
<p>did.  Afterward he was willing enough to make friends, but they</p>
<p>bristled and cursed whenever he came near them.</p>
<p>It was the same with everybody.  If he went out for a walk on the</p>
<p>beach, Vigneau&#x27;s dogs or Simard&#x27;s dogs regarded it as an insult, and</p>
<p>there was a fight.  Men picked up sticks, or showed him the butt-end</p>
<p>of their dog-whips, when he made friendly approaches.  With the</p>
<p>children it was different; they seemed to like him a little; but</p>
<p>never did he follow one of them that a mother did not call from the</p>
<p>house-door: &quot;Pierre!  Marie! come away quick!  That bad dog will</p>
<p>bite you!&quot;  Once when he ran down to the shore to watch the boat</p>
<p>coming in from the mail-steamer, the purser had refused to let the</p>
<p>boat go to land, and called out, &quot;M&#x27;sieu&#x27; MacIntosh, you git no</p>
<p>malle dis trip, eef you not call avay dat dam&#x27; dog.&quot;</p>
<p>True, the Minganites seemed to take a certain kind of pride in his</p>
<p>reputation.  They had brought Chouart&#x27;s big brown dog, Gripette,</p>
<p>down from the Sheldrake to meet him; and after the meeting was over</p>
<p>and Gripette had been revived with a bucket of water, everybody,</p>
<p>except Chouart, appeared to be in good humour.  The purser of the</p>
<p>steamer had gone to the trouble of introducing a famous BOULE-DOGGE</p>
<p>from Quebec, on the trip after that on which he had given such a</p>
<p>hostile opinion of Pichon.  The bulldog&#x27;s intentions were</p>
<p>unmistakable; he expressed them the moment he touched the beach; and</p>
<p>when they carried him back to the boat on a fish-barrow many</p>
<p>flattering words were spoken about Pichou.  He was not insensible to</p>
<p>them.  But these tributes to his prowess were not what he really</p>
<p>wanted.  His secret desire was for tokens of affection.  His</p>
<p>position was honourable, but it was intolerably lonely and full of</p>
<p>trouble.  He sought peace and he found fights.</p>
<p>While he meditated dimly on these things, patiently trying to get</p>
<p>the ashes of Dan Scott&#x27;s pipe out of his nose, his heart was cast</p>
<p>down and his spirit was disquieted within him.  Was ever a decent</p>
<p>dog so mishandled before?  Kicked for nothing by a fat stranger, and</p>
<p>then beaten by his own master!</p>
<p>In the dining-room of the Post, Grant was slowly and reluctantly</p>
<p>allowing himself to be convinced that his injuries were not fatal.</p>
<p>During this process considerable Scotch whiskey was consumed and</p>
<p>there was much conversation about the viciousness of dogs.  Grant</p>
<p>insisted that Pichou was mad and had a devil.  MacIntosh admitted</p>
<p>the devil, but firmly denied the madness.  The question was, whether</p>
<p>the dog should be killed or not; and over this point there was like</p>
<p>to be more bloodshed, until Dan Scott made his contribution to the</p>
<p>argument: &quot;If you shoot him, how can you tell whether he is mad or</p>
<p>not?  I&#x27;ll give thirty dollars for him and take him home.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you do,&quot; said Grant, &quot;you&#x27;ll sail alone, and I&#x27;ll wait for the</p>
<p>steamer.  Never a step will I go in the boat with the crazy brute</p>
<p>that bit me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; said Dan Scott.  &quot;You kicked before he bit.&quot;</p>
<p>At daybreak he whistled the dog down to the chaloupe, hoisted sail,</p>
<p>and bore away for Seven Islands.  There was a secret bond of</p>
<p>sympathy between the two companions on that hundred-mile voyage in</p>
<p>an open boat.  Neither of them realized what it was, but still it</p>
<p>was there.</p>
<p>Dan Scott knew what it meant to stand alone, to face a small hostile</p>
<p>world, to have a surfeit of fighting.  The station of Seven Islands</p>
<p>was the hardest in all the district of the ancient POSTES DU ROI.</p>
<p>The Indians were surly and crafty.  They knew all the tricks of the</p>
<p>fur-trade.  They killed out of season, and understood how to make a</p>
<p>rusty pelt look black.  The former agent had accommodated himself to</p>
<p>his customers.  He had no objection to shutting one of his eyes, so</p>
<p>long as the other could see a chance of doing a stroke of business</p>
<p>for himself.  He also had a convenient weakness in the sense of</p>
<p>smell, when there was an old stock of pork to work off on the</p>
<p>savages.  But all of Dan Scott&#x27;s senses were strong, especially his</p>
<p>sense of justice, and he came into the Post resolved to play a</p>
<p>straight game with both hands, toward the Indians and toward the</p>
<p>Honourable H. B. Company.  The immediate results were reproofs from</p>
<p>Ottawa and revilings from Seven Islands.  Furthermore the free</p>
<p>traders were against him because he objected to their selling rum to</p>
<p>the savages.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Dan Scott had a way with him that looked</p>
<p>pugnacious.  He was quick in his motions and carried his shoulders</p>
<p>well thrown back.  His voice was heavy.  He used short words and few</p>
<p>of them.  His eyebrow&#x27;s were thick and they met over his nose.  Then</p>
<p>there was a broad white scar at one corner of his mouth.  His</p>
<p>appearance was not prepossessing, but at heart he was a</p>
<p>philanthropist and a sentimentalist. He thirsted for gratitude and</p>
<p>affection on a just basis.  He had studied for eighteen months in</p>
<p>the medical school at Montreal, and his chief delight was to</p>
<p>practise gratuitously among the sick and wounded of the</p>
<p>neighbourhood.  His ambition for Seven Islands was to make it a</p>
<p>northern suburb of Paradise, and for himself to become a full-</p>
<p>fledged physician.  Up to this time it seemed as if he would have to</p>
<p>break more bones than he could set; and the closest connection of</p>
<p>Seven Islands appeared to be with Purgatory.</p>
<p>First, there had been a question of suzerainty between Dan Scott and</p>
<p>the local representative of the Astor family, a big half-breed</p>
<p>descendant of a fur-trader, who was the virtual chief of the Indians</p>
<p>hunting on the Ste. Marguerite: settled by knock-down arguments.</p>
<p>Then there was a controversy with Napoleon Bouchard about the right</p>
<p>to put a fish-house on a certain part of the beach: settled with a</p>
<p>stick, after Napoleon had drawn a knife.  Then there was a running</p>
<p>warfare with Virgile and Ovide Boulianne, the free traders, who were</p>
<p>his rivals in dealing with the Indians for their peltry: still</p>
<p>unsettled.  After this fashion the record of his relations with his</p>
<p>fellow-citizens at Seven Islands was made up.  He had their respect,</p>
<p>but not their affection.  He was the only Protestant, the only</p>
<p>English-speaker, the most intelligent man, as well as the hardest</p>
<p>hitter in the place, and he was very lonely.  Perhaps it was this</p>
<p>that made him take a fancy to Pichou.  Their positions in the world</p>
<p>were not unlike.  He was not the first man who has wanted sympathy</p>
<p>and found it in a dog.</p>
<p>Alone together, in the same boat, they made friends with each other</p>
<p>easily.  At first the remembrance of the hot pipe left a little</p>
<p>suspicion in Pichou&#x27;s mind; but this was removed by a handsome</p>
<p>apology in the shape of a chunk of bread and a slice of meat from</p>
<p>Dan Scott&#x27;s lunch.  After this they got on together finely.  It was</p>
<p>the first time in his life that Pichou had ever spent twenty-four</p>
<p>hours away from other dogs; it was also the first time he had ever</p>
<p>been treated like a gentleman.  All that was best in him responded</p>
<p>to the treatment.  He could not have been more quiet and steady in</p>
<p>the boat if he had been brought up to a seafaring life.  When Dan</p>
<p>Scott called him and patted him on the head, the dog looked up in</p>
<p>the man&#x27;s face as if he had found his God.  And the man, looking</p>
<p>down into the eye that was not disfigured by the black patch, saw</p>
<p>something that he had been seeking for a long time.</p>
<p>All day the wind was fair and strong from the southeast. The</p>
<p>chaloupe ran swiftly along the coast past the broad mouth of the</p>
<p>River Saint-Jean, with its cluster of white cottages past the hill-</p>
<p>encircled bay of the River Magpie, with its big fish-houses past the</p>
<p>fire-swept cliffs of Riviere-au-Tonnerre, and the turbulent, rocky</p>
<p>shores of the Sheldrake: past the silver cascade of the Riviere-aux-</p>
<p>Graines, and the mist of the hidden fall of the Riviere Manitou:</p>
<p>past the long, desolate ridges of Cap Cormorant, where, at sunset,</p>
<p>the wind began to droop away, and the tide was contrary So the</p>
<p>chaloupe felt its way cautiously toward the corner of the coast</p>
<p>where the little Riviere-a-la-Truite comes tumbling in among the</p>
<p>brown rocks, and found a haven for the night in the mouth of the</p>
<p>river.</p>
<p>There was only one human dwelling-place in sight As far as the eye</p>
<p>could sweep, range after range of uninhabitable hills covered with</p>
<p>the skeletons of dead forests; ledge after ledge of ice-worn granite</p>
<p>thrust out like fangs into the foaming waves of the gulf.  Nature,</p>
<p>with her teeth bare and her lips scarred: this was the landscape.</p>
<p>And in the midst of it, on a low hill above the murmuring river,</p>
<p>surrounded by the blanched trunks of fallen trees, and the blackened</p>
<p>debris of wood and moss, a small, square, weather-beaten palisade of</p>
<p>rough-hewn spruce, and a patch of the bright green leaves and white</p>
<p>flowers of the dwarf cornel lavishing their beauty on a lonely</p>
<p>grave.  This was the only habitation in sight--the last home of the</p>
<p>Englishman, Jack Chisholm, whose story has yet to be told.</p>
<p>In the shelter of this hill Dan Scott cooked his supper and shared</p>
<p>it with Pichou.  When night was dark he rolled himself in his</p>
<p>blanket, and slept in the stern of the boat, with the dog at his</p>
<p>side.  Their friendship was sealed.</p>
<p>The next morning the weather was squally and full of sudden anger.</p>
<p>They crept out with difficulty through the long rollers that barred</p>
<p>the tiny harbour, and beat their way along the coast.  At Moisie</p>
<p>they must run far out into the gulf to avoid the treacherous shoals,</p>
<p>and to pass beyond the furious race of white-capped billows that</p>
<p>poured from the great river for miles into the sea.  Then they</p>
<p>turned and made for the group of half-submerged mountains and</p>
<p>scattered rocks that Nature, in some freak of fury, had thrown into</p>
<p>the throat of Seven Islands Bay.  That was a difficult passage.  The</p>
<p>black shores were swept by headlong tides.  Tusks of granite tore</p>
<p>the waves.  Baffled and perplexed, the wind flapped and whirled</p>
<p>among the cliffs. Through all this the little boat buffeted bravely</p>
<p>on till she reached the point of the Gran Boule.  Then a strange</p>
<p>thing happened.</p>
<p>The water was lumpy; the evening was growing thick; a swirl of the</p>
<p>tide and a shift of the wind caught the chaloupe and swung her</p>
<p>suddenly around.  The mainsail jibed, and before he knew how it</p>
<p>happened Dan Scott was overboard.  He could swim but clumsily.  The</p>
<p>water blinded him, choked him, dragged him down.  Then he felt</p>
<p>Pichou gripping him by the shoulder, buoying him up, swimming</p>
<p>mightily toward the chaloupe which hung trembling in the wind a few</p>
<p>yards away.  At last they reached it and the man climbed over the</p>
<p>stern and pulled the dog after him.  Dan Scott lay in the bottom of</p>
<p>the boat, shivering, dazed, until he felt the dog&#x27;s cold nose and</p>
<p>warm breath against his cheek.  He flung his arm around Pichon&#x27;s</p>
<p>neck.</p>
<p>&quot;They said you were mad!  God, if more men were mad like you!&quot;</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Pichou&#x27;s work at Seven Islands was cut out for him on a generous</p>
<p>scale.  It is true that at first he had no regular canine labour to</p>
<p>perform, for it was summer.  Seven months of the year, on the North</p>
<p>Shore, a sledge-dog&#x27;s occupation is gone.  He is the idlest creature</p>
<p>in the universe.</p>
<p>But Pichou, being a new-comer, had to win his footing in the</p>
<p>community; and that was no light task.  With the humans it was</p>
<p>comparatively easy.  At the outset they mistrusted him on account of</p>
<p>his looks.  Virgile Boulianne asked: &quot;Why did you buy such an ugly</p>
<p>dog?&quot;  Ovide, who was the wit of the family, said: &quot;I suppose</p>
<p>M&#x27;sieu&#x27; Scott got a present for taking him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a good dog,&quot; said Dan Scott.  &quot;Treat him well and he&#x27;ll treat</p>
<p>you well.  Kick him and I kick you.&quot;</p>
<p>Then he told what had happened off the point of Gran&#x27; Boule.  The</p>
<p>village decided to accept Pichou at his master&#x27;s valuation.</p>
<p>Moderate friendliness, with precautions, was shown toward him by</p>
<p>everybody, except Napoleon Bouchard, whose distrust was permanent</p>
<p>and took the form of a stick.  He was a fat, fussy man; fat people</p>
<p>seemed to have no affinity for Pichou.</p>
<p>But while the relations with the humans of Seven Islands were soon</p>
<p>established on a fair footing, with the canines Pichou had a very</p>
<p>different affair.  They were not willing to accept any</p>
<p>recommendations as to character.  They judged for themselves; and</p>
<p>they judged by appearances; and their judgment was utterly hostile</p>
<p>to Pichou.</p>
<p>They decided that he was a proud dog, a fierce dog, a bad dog, a</p>
<p>fighter.  He must do one of two things: stay at home in the yard of</p>
<p>the Honourable H. B. Company, which is a thing that no self-</p>
<p>respecting dog would do in the summer-time, when cod-fish heads are</p>
<p>strewn along the beach; or fight his way from one end of the village</p>
<p>to the other, which Pichou promptly did, leaving enemies behind</p>
<p>every fence.  Huskies never forget a grudge.  They are malignant to</p>
<p>the core.  Hatred is the wine of cowardly hearts.  This is as true</p>
<p>of dogs as it is of men.</p>
<p>Then Pichou, having settled his foreign relations, turned his</p>
<p>attention to matters at home.  There were four other dogs in Dan</p>
<p>Scott&#x27;s team.  They did not want Pichou for a leader, and he knew</p>
<p>it.  They were bitter with jealousy.  The black patch was loathsome</p>
<p>to them.  They treated him disrespectfully, insultingly, grossly.</p>
<p>Affairs came to a head when Pecan, a rusty gray dog who had great</p>
<p>ambitions and little sense, disputed Pichou&#x27;s tenure of a certain</p>
<p>ham-bone.  Dan Scott looked on placidly while the dispute was</p>
<p>terminated.  Then he washed the blood and sand from the gashes on</p>
<p>Pecan&#x27;s shoulder, and patted Pichou on the head.</p>
<p>&quot;Good dog,&quot; he said.  &quot;You&#x27;re the boss.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no further question about Pichou&#x27;s leadership of the team.</p>
<p>But the obedience of his followers was unwilling and sullen.  There</p>
<p>was no love in it.  Imagine an English captain, with a Boer company,</p>
<p>campaigning in the Ashantee country, and you will have a fair idea</p>
<p>of Pichou&#x27;s position at Seven Islands.</p>
<p>He did not shrink from its responsibilities.  There were certain</p>
<p>reforms in the community which seemed to him of vital importance,</p>
<p>and he put them through.</p>
<p>First of all, he made up his mind that there ought to be peace and</p>
<p>order on the village street.  In the yards of the houses that were</p>
<p>strung along it there should be home rule, and every dog should deal</p>
<p>with trespassers as he saw fit.  Also on the beach, and around the</p>
<p>fish-shanties, and under the racks where the cod were drying, the</p>
<p>right of the strong jaw should prevail, and differences of opinion</p>
<p>should be adjusted in the old-fashioned way.  But on the sandy road,</p>
<p>bordered with a broken board-walk, which ran between the houses and</p>
<p>the beach, courtesy and propriety must be observed.  Visitors walked</p>
<p>there.  Children played there.  It was the general promenade.  It</p>
<p>must be kept peaceful and decent.  This was the First Law of the</p>
<p>Dogs of Seven Islands.  If two dogs quarrel on the street they must</p>
<p>go elsewhere to settle it.  It was highly unpopular, but Pichou</p>
<p>enforced it with his teeth.</p>
<p>The Second Law was equally unpopular: No stealing from the</p>
<p>Honourable H. B. Company.  If a man bought bacon or corned-beef or</p>
<p>any other delicacy, and stored it an insecure place, or if he left</p>
<p>fish on the beach over night, his dogs might act according to their</p>
<p>inclination.  Though Pichou did not understand how honest dogs could</p>
<p>steal from their own master, he was willing to admit that this was</p>
<p>their affair.  His affair was that nobody should steal anything from</p>
<p>the Post.  It cost him many night watches, and some large battles to</p>
<p>carry it out, but he did it.  In the course of time it came to pass</p>
<p>that the other dogs kept away from the Post altogether, to avoid</p>
<p>temptations; and his own team spent most of their free time</p>
<p>wandering about to escape discipline.</p>
<p>The Third Law was this.  Strange dogs must be decently treated as</p>
<p>long as they behave decently.  This was contrary to all tradition,</p>
<p>but Pichou insisted upon it.  If a strange dog wanted to fight he</p>
<p>should be accommodated with an antagonist of his own size.  If he</p>
<p>did not want to fight he should be politely smelled and allowed to</p>
<p>pass through.</p>
<p>This Law originated on a day when a miserable, long-legged, black</p>
<p>cur, a cross between a greyhound and a water-spaniel, strayed into</p>
<p>Seven Islands from heaven knows where--weary, desolate, and</p>
<p>bedraggled.  All the dogs in the place attacked the homeless beggar.</p>
<p>There was a howling fracas on the beach; and when Pichou arrived,</p>
<p>the trembling cur was standing up to the neck in the water, facing a</p>
<p>semicircle of snarling, snapping bullies who dared not venture out</p>
<p>any farther.  Pichou had no fear of the water.  He swam out to the</p>
<p>stranger, paid the smelling salute as well as possible under the</p>
<p>circumstances, encouraged the poor creature to come ashore, warned</p>
<p>off the other dogs, and trotted by the wanderer&#x27;s side for miles</p>
<p>down the beach until they disappeared around the point.  What reward</p>
<p>Pichou got for this polite escort, I do not know.  But I saw him do</p>
<p>the gallant deed; and I suppose this was the origin of the well-</p>
<p>known and much-resisted Law of Strangers&#x27; Rights in Seven Islands.</p>
<p>The most recalcitrant subjects with whom Pichou had to deal in all</p>
<p>these matters were the team of Ovide Boulianne.  There were five of</p>
<p>them, and up to this time they had been the best team in the</p>
<p>village.  They had one virtue: under the whip they could whirl a</p>
<p>sledge over the snow farther and faster than a horse could trot in a</p>
<p>day.  But they had innumerable vices.  Their leader, Carcajou, had a</p>
<p>fleece like a merino ram.  But under this coat of innocence he</p>
<p>carried a heart so black that he would bite while he was wagging his</p>
<p>tail.  This smooth devil, and his four followers like unto himself,</p>
<p>had sworn relentless hatred to Pichou, and they made his life</p>
<p>difficult.</p>
<p>But his great and sufficient consolation for all toils and troubles</p>
<p>was the friendship with his master.  In the long summer evenings,</p>
<p>when Dan Scott was making up his accounts in the store, or studying</p>
<p>his pocket cyclopaedia of medicine in the living-room of the Post,</p>
<p>with its low beams and mysterious green-painted cupboards, Pichou</p>
<p>would lie contentedly at his feet.  In the frosty autumnal mornings,</p>
<p>when the brant were flocking in the marshes at the head of the bay,</p>
<p>they would go out hunting together in a skiff.  And who could lie so</p>
<p>still as Pichou when the game was approaching?  Or who could spring</p>
<p>so quickly and joyously to retrieve a wounded bird?  But best of all</p>
<p>were the long walks on Sunday afternoons, on the yellow beach that</p>
<p>stretched away toward the Moisie, or through the fir-forest behind</p>
<p>the Pointe des Chasseurs.  Then master and dog had fellowship</p>
<p>together in silence.  To the dumb companion it was like walking with</p>
<p>his God in the garden in the cool of the day.</p>
<p>When winter came, and snow fell, and waters froze, Pichou&#x27;s serious</p>
<p>duties began.  The long, slim COMETIQUE, with its curving prow, and</p>
<p>its runners of whalebone, was put in order.  The harness of caribou-</p>
<p>hide was repaired and strengthened.  The dogs, even the most vicious</p>
<p>of them, rejoiced at the prospect of doing the one thing that they</p>
<p>could do best.  Each one strained at his trace as if he would drag</p>
<p>the sledge alone.  Then the long tandem was straightened out, Dan</p>
<p>Scott took his place on the low seat, cracked his whip, shouted</p>
<p>&quot;POUITTE!  POUITTE!&quot; and the equipage darted along the snowy track</p>
<p>like a fifty-foot arrow.</p>
<p>Pichou was in the lead, and he showed his metal from the start.  No</p>
<p>need of the terrible FOUET to lash him forward or to guide his</p>
<p>course.  A word was enough.  &quot;Hoc!  Hoc!  Hoc!&quot; and he swung to the</p>
<p>right, avoiding an air-hole.  &quot;Re-re!  Re-re!&quot; and he veered to the</p>
<p>left, dodging a heap of broken ice.  Past the mouth of the Ste.</p>
<p>Marguerite, twelve miles; past Les Jambons, twelve miles more; past</p>
<p>the River of Rocks and La Pentecote, fifteen miles more; into the</p>
<p>little hamlet of Dead Men&#x27;s Point, behind the Isle of the Wise</p>
<p>Virgin, whither the amateur doctor had been summoned by telegraph to</p>
<p>attend a patient with a broken arm--forty-three miles for the first</p>
<p>day&#x27;s run!  Not bad.  Then the dogs got their food for the day, one</p>
<p>dried fish apiece; and at noon the next day, reckless of bleeding</p>
<p>feet, they flew back over the same track, and broke their fast at</p>
<p>Seven Islands before eight o&#x27;clock.  The ration was the same, a</p>
<p>single fish; always the same, except when it was varied by a cube of</p>
<p>ancient, evil-smelling, potent whale&#x27;s flesh, which a dog can</p>
<p>swallow at a single gulp.  Yet the dogs of the North Shore are never</p>
<p>so full of vigour, courage, and joy of life as when the sledges are</p>
<p>running.  It is in summer, when food is plenty and work slack, that</p>
<p>they sicken and die.</p>
<p>Pichou&#x27;s leadership of his team became famous.  Under his discipline</p>
<p>the other dogs developed speed and steadiness.  One day they made</p>
<p>the distance to the Godbout in a single journey, a wonderful run of</p>
<p>over eighty miles.  But they loved their leader no better, though</p>
<p>they followed him faster.  And as for the other teams, especially</p>
<p>Carcajou&#x27;s, they were still firm in their deadly hatred for the dog</p>
<p>with the black patch.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>It was in the second winter after Pichou&#x27;s coming to Seven Islands</p>
<p>that the great trial of his courage arrived.  Late in February an</p>
<p>Indian runner on snowshoes staggered into the village.  He brought</p>
<p>news from the hunting-parties that were wintering far up on the Ste.</p>
<p>Marguerite--good news and bad.  First, they had already made a good</p>
<p>hunting: for the pelletrie, that is to say.  They had killed many</p>
<p>otter, some fisher and beaver, and four silver foxes--a marvel of</p>
<p>fortune.  But then, for the food, the chase was bad, very bad--no</p>
<p>caribou, no hare, no ptarmigan, nothing for many days.  Provisions</p>
<p>were very low.  There were six families together.  Then la grippe</p>
<p>had taken hold of them.  They were sick, starving.  They would</p>
<p>probably die, at least most of the women and children.  It was a bad</p>
<p>job.</p>
<p>Dan Scott had peculiar ideas of his duty toward the savages.  He was</p>
<p>not romantic, but he liked to do the square thing.  Besides, he had</p>
<p>been reading up on la grippe, and he had some new medicine for it,</p>
<p>capsules from Montreal, very powerful--quinine, phenacetine, and</p>
<p>morphine.  He was as eager to try this new medicine as a boy is to</p>
<p>fire off a new gun.  He loaded the Cometique with provisions and the</p>
<p>medicine-chest with capsules, harnessed his team, and started up the</p>
<p>river.  Thermometer thirty degrees below zero; air like crystal;</p>
<p>snow six feet deep on the level.</p>
<p>The first day&#x27;s journey was slow, for the going was soft, and the</p>
<p>track, at places, had to be broken out with snow-shoes.  Camp was</p>
<p>made at the foot of the big fall--a hole in snow, a bed of boughs, a</p>
<p>hot fire and a blanket stretched on a couple of sticks to reflect</p>
<p>the heat, the dogs on the other side of the fire, and Pichou close</p>
<p>to his master.</p>
<p>In the morning there was the steep hill beside the fall to climb,</p>
<p>alternately soft and slippery, now a slope of glass and now a</p>
<p>treacherous drift of yielding feathers; it was a road set on end.</p>
<p>But Pichou flattened his back and strained his loins and dug his</p>
<p>toes into the snow and would not give back an inch.  When the rest</p>
<p>of the team balked the long whip slashed across their backs and</p>
<p>recalled them to their duty.  At last their leader topped the ridge,</p>
<p>and the others struggled after him.  Before them stretched the great</p>
<p>dead-water of the river, a straight white path to No-man&#x27;s-land.</p>
<p>The snow was smooth and level, and the crust was hard enough to</p>
<p>bear.  Pichou settled down to his work at a glorious pace.  He</p>
<p>seemed to know that he must do his best, and that something</p>
<p>important depended on the quickness of his legs.  On through the</p>
<p>glittering solitude, on through the death-like silence, sped the</p>
<p>COMETIQUE, between the interminable walls of the forest, past the</p>
<p>mouths of nameless rivers, under the shadow of grim mountains.  At</p>
<p>noon Dan Scott boiled the kettle, and ate his bread and bacon.  But</p>
<p>there was nothing for the dogs, not even for Pichou; for discipline</p>
<p>is discipline, and the best of sledge-dogs will not run well after</p>
<p>he has been fed.</p>
<p>Then forward again, along the lifeless road, slowly over rapids,</p>
<p>where the ice was rough and broken, swiftly over still waters, where</p>
<p>the way was level, until they came to the foot of the last lake, and</p>
<p>camped for the night.  The Indians were but a few miles away, at the</p>
<p>head of the lake, and it would be easy to reach them in the morning.</p>
<p>But there was another camp on the Ste. Marguerite that night, and it</p>
<p>was nearer to Dan Scott than the Indians were.  Ovide Boulianne had</p>
<p>followed him up the river, close on his track, which made the going</p>
<p>easier.</p>
<p>&quot;Does that sacre bourgeois suppose that I allow him all that</p>
<p>pelletrie to himself and the Compagnie?  Four silver fox, besides</p>
<p>otter and beaver?  NON, MERCI!  I take some provision, and some</p>
<p>whiskey.  I go to make trade also.&quot;  Thus spoke the shrewd Ovide,</p>
<p>proving that commerce is no less daring, no less resolute, than</p>
<p>philanthropy.  The only difference is in the motive, and that is not</p>
<p>always visible.  Ovide camped the second night at a bend of the</p>
<p>river, a mile below the foot of the lake.  Between him and Dan Scott</p>
<p>there was a hill covered with a dense thicket of spruce.</p>
<p>By what magic did Carcajou know that Pichou, his old enemy, was so</p>
<p>near him in that vast wilderness of white death?  By what mysterious</p>
<p>language did he communicate his knowledge to his companions and stir</p>
<p>the sleeping hatred in their hearts and mature the conspiracy of</p>
<p>revenge?</p>
<p>Pichou, sleeping by the fire, was awakened by the fall of a lump of</p>
<p>snow from the branch of a shaken evergreen.  That was nothing.  But</p>
<p>there were other sounds in the forest, faint, stealthy, inaudible to</p>
<p>an ear less keen than his.  He crept out of the shelter and looked</p>
<p>into the wood.  He could see shadowy forms, stealing among the</p>
<p>trees, gliding down the hill.  Five of them.  Wolves, doubtless!  He</p>
<p>must guard the provisions.  By this time the rest of his team were</p>
<p>awake.  Their eyes glittered.  They stirred uneasily.  But they did</p>
<p>not move from the dying fire.  It was no concern of theirs what</p>
<p>their leader chose to do out of hours.  In the traces they would</p>
<p>follow him, but there was no loyalty in their hearts.  Pichou stood</p>
<p>alone by the sledge, waiting for the wolves.</p>
<p>But these were no wolves.  They were assassins.  Like a company of</p>
<p>soldiers, they lined up together and rushed silently down the slope.</p>
<p>Like lightning they leaped upon the solitary dog and struck him</p>
<p>down.  In an instant, before Dan Scott could throw off his blanket</p>
<p>and seize the loaded butt of his whip, Pichou&#x27;s throat and breast</p>
<p>were torn to rags, his life-blood poured upon the snow, and his</p>
<p>murderers were slinking away, slavering and muttering through the</p>
<p>forest.</p>
<p>Dan Scott knelt beside his best friend.  At a glance he saw that the</p>
<p>injury was fatal.  &quot;Well done, Pichou!&quot; he murmured, &quot;you fought a</p>
<p>good fight.&quot;</p>
<p>And the dog, by a brave effort, lifted the head with the black patch</p>
<p>on it, for the last time, licked his master&#x27;, hand, and then dropped</p>
<p>back upon the snow--contented, happy, dead.</p>
<p>There is but one drawback to a dog&#x27;s friendship.  It does not last</p>
<p>long enough.</p>
<p>End of the story?  Well, if you care for the other people in it, you</p>
<p>shall hear what became of them.  Dan Scott went on to the head of</p>
<p>the lake and found the Indians, and fed them and gave them his</p>
<p>medicine, and all of them got well except two, and they continued to</p>
<p>hunt along the Ste. Marguerite every winter and trade with the</p>
<p>Honourable H. B. Company.  Not with Dan Scott, however, for before</p>
<p>that year was ended he resigned his post, and went to Montreal to</p>
<p>finish his course in medicine; and now he is a respected physician</p>
<p>in Ontario.  Married; three children; useful; prosperous.  But</p>
<p>before he left Seven Islands he went up the Ste. Marguerite in the</p>
<p>summer, by canoe, and made a grave for Pichou&#x27;s bones, under a</p>
<p>blossoming ash tree, among the ferns and wild flowers.  He put a</p>
<p>cross over it.</p>
<p>&quot;Being French,&quot; said he, &quot;I suppose he was a Catholic.  But I&#x27;ll</p>
<p>swear he was a Christian.&quot;</p>
<p>THE WHITE BLOT</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>The real location of a city house depends upon the pictures which</p>
<p>hang upon its walls.  They are its neighbourhood and its outlook.</p>
<p>They confer upon it that touch of life and character, that power to</p>
<p>beget love and bind friendship, which a country house receives from</p>
<p>its surrounding landscape, the garden that embraces it, the stream</p>
<p>that runs near it, and the shaded paths that lead to and from its</p>
<p>door.</p>
<p>By this magic of pictures my narrow, upright slice of living-space</p>
<p>in one of the brown-stone strata on the eastward slope of Manhattan</p>
<p>Island is transferred to an open and agreeable site.  It has windows</p>
<p>that look toward the woods and the sunset, watergates by which a</p>
<p>little boat is always waiting, and secret passageways leading into</p>
<p>fair places that are frequented by persons of distinction and charm.</p>
<p>No darkness of night obscures these outlets; no neighbour&#x27;s house</p>
<p>shuts off the view; no drifted snow of winter makes them impassable.</p>
<p>They are always free, and through them I go out and in upon my</p>
<p>adventures.</p>
<p>One of these picture-wanderings has always appeared to me so</p>
<p>singular that I would like, if it were possible, to put it into</p>
<p>words.</p>
<p>It was Pierrepont who first introduced me to the picture--Pierrepont</p>
<p>the good-natured: of whom one of his friends said that he was like</p>
<p>Mahomet&#x27;s Bridge of Paradise, because he was so hard to cross: to</p>
<p>which another added that there was also a resemblance in the fact</p>
<p>that he led to a region of beautiful illusions which he never</p>
<p>entered.  He is one of those enthusiastic souls who are always</p>
<p>discovering a new writer, a new painter, a new view from some old</p>
<p>wharf by the river, a new place to obtain picturesque dinners at a</p>
<p>grotesque price.  He swung out of his office, with his long-legged,</p>
<p>easy stride, and nearly ran me down, as I was plodding up-town</p>
<p>through the languor of a late spring afternoon, on one of those</p>
<p>duty-walks which conscience offers as a sacrifice to digestion.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, what is the matter with you?&quot; he cried as he linked his arm</p>
<p>through mine, &quot;you look outdone, tired all the way through to your</p>
<p>backbone.  Have you been reading the &#x27;Anatomy of Melancholy,&#x27; or</p>
<p>something by one of the new British female novelists?  You will have</p>
<p>la grippe in your mind if you don&#x27;t look out.  But I know what you</p>
<p>need.  Come with me, and I will do you good.&quot;</p>
<p>So saying, he drew me out of clanging Broadway into one of the side</p>
<p>streets that run toward the placid region of Washington Square.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; I answered, feeling, even in the act of resistance, the</p>
<p>pleasure of his cheerful guidance, &quot;you are altogether wrong.  I</p>
<p>don&#x27;t need a dinner at your new-found Bulgarian table-d&#x27;hote--seven</p>
<p>courses for seventy-five cents, and the wine thrown out; nor some of</p>
<p>those wonderful Mexican cheroots warranted to eradicate the tobacco-</p>
<p>habit; nor a draught of your South American melon sherbet that cures</p>
<p>all pains, except these which it causes.  None of these things will</p>
<p>help me.  The doctor suggests that they do not suit my temperament.</p>
<p>Let us go home together and have a shower-bath and a dinner of</p>
<p>herbs, with just a reminiscence of the stalled ox--and a bout at</p>
<p>backgammon to wind up the evening.  That will be the most</p>
<p>comfortable prescription.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you mistake me,&quot; said he; &quot;I am not thinking of any creature</p>
<p>comforts for you.  I am prescribing for your mind.  There is a</p>
<p>picture that I want you to see; not a coloured photograph, nor an</p>
<p>exercise in anatomical drawing; but a real picture that will rest</p>
<p>the eyes of your heart.  Come away with me to Morgenstern&#x27;s gallery,</p>
<p>and be healed.&quot;</p>
<p>As we turned into the lower end of Fifth Avenue, it seemed as if I</p>
<p>were being gently floated along between the modest apartment-houses</p>
<p>and old-fashioned dwellings, and prim, respectable churches, on the</p>
<p>smooth current of Pierrepont&#x27;s talk about his new-found picture.</p>
<p>How often a man has cause to return thanks for the enthusiasms of</p>
<p>his friends!  They are the little fountains that run down from the</p>
<p>hills to refresh the mental desert of the despondent.</p>
<p>&quot;You remember Falconer,&quot; continued Pierrepont, &quot;Temple Falconer,</p>
<p>that modest, quiet, proud fellow who came out of the South a couple</p>
<p>of years ago and carried off the landscape prize at the Academy last</p>
<p>year, and then disappeared?  He had no intimate friends here, and no</p>
<p>one knew what had become of him.  But now this picture appears, to</p>
<p>show what he has been doing.  It is an evening scene, a revelation</p>
<p>of the beauty of sadness, an idea expressed in colours--or rather, a</p>
<p>real impression of Nature that awakens an ideal feeling in the</p>
<p>heart.  It does not define everything and say nothing, like so many</p>
<p>paintings.  It tells no story, but I know it fits into one.  There</p>
<p>is not a figure in it, and yet it is alive with sentiment; it</p>
<p>suggests thoughts which cannot be put into words.  Don&#x27;t you love</p>
<p>the pictures that have that power of suggestion--quiet and strong,</p>
<p>like Homer Martin&#x27;s &#x27;Light-house&#x27; up at the Century, with its</p>
<p>sheltered bay heaving softly under the pallid greenish sky of</p>
<p>evening, and the calm, steadfast glow of the lantern brightening</p>
<p>into readiness for all the perils of night and coming storm?  How</p>
<p>much more powerful that is than all the conventional pictures of</p>
<p>light-houses on inaccessible cliffs, with white foam streaming from</p>
<p>them like the ends of a schoolboy&#x27;s comforter in a gale of wind!  I</p>
<p>tell you the real painters are the fellows who love pure nature</p>
<p>because it is so human.  They don&#x27;t need to exaggerate, and they</p>
<p>don&#x27;t dare to be affected.  They are not afraid of the reality, and</p>
<p>they are not ashamed of the sentiment.  They don&#x27;t paint everything</p>
<p>that they see, but they see everything that they paint.  And this</p>
<p>picture makes me sure that Falconer is one of them.&quot;</p>
<p>By this time we had arrived at the door of the house where</p>
<p>Morgenstern lives and moves and makes his profits, and were admitted</p>
<p>to the shrine of the Commercial Apollo and the Muses in Trade.</p>
<p>It has often seemed to me as if that little house were a silent</p>
<p>epitome of modern art criticism, an automatic indicator, or perhaps</p>
<p>regulator, of the aesthetic taste of New York.  On the first floor,</p>
<p>surrounded by all the newest fashions in antiquities and BRIC-A-</p>
<p>BRAC, you will see the art of to-day--the works of painters who are</p>
<p>precisely in the focus of advertisement, and whose names call out an</p>
<p>instant round of applause in the auction-room.  On the floors above,</p>
<p>in degrees of obscurity deepening toward the attic, you will find</p>
<p>the art of yesterday--the pictures which have passed out of the</p>
<p>glare of popularity without yet arriving at the mellow radiance of</p>
<p>old masters.  In the basement, concealed in huge packing-cases, and</p>
<p>marked &quot;PARIS--FRAGILE,&quot;--you will find the art of to-morrow; the</p>
<p>paintings of the men in regard to whose names, styles, and personal</p>
<p>traits, the foreign correspondents and prophetic critics in the</p>
<p>newspapers, are now diffusing in the public mind that twilight of</p>
<p>familiarity and ignorance which precedes the sunrise of marketable</p>
<p>fame.</p>
<p>The affable and sagacious Morgenstern was already well acquainted</p>
<p>with the waywardness of Pierrepont&#x27;s admiration, and with my own</p>
<p>persistent disregard of current quotations in the valuation of works</p>
<p>of art.  He regarded us, I suppose, very much as Robin Hood would</p>
<p>have looked upon a pair of plain yeomen who had strayed into his</p>
<p>lair.  The knights of capital, and coal barons, and rich merchants</p>
<p>were his natural prey, but toward this poor but honest couple it</p>
<p>would be worthy only of a Gentile robber to show anything but</p>
<p>courteous and fair dealing.</p>
<p>He expressed no surprise when he heard what we wanted to see, but</p>
<p>smiled tolerantly and led the way, not into the well-defined realm</p>
<p>of the past, the present, or the future, but into a region of</p>
<p>uncertain fortunes, a limbo of acknowledged but unrewarded merits, a</p>
<p>large back room devoted to the works of American painters.  Here we</p>
<p>found Falconer&#x27;s picture; and the dealer, with that instinctive tact</p>
<p>which is the best part of his business capital, left us alone to</p>
<p>look at it.</p>
<p>It showed the mouth of a little river: a secluded lagoon, where the</p>
<p>shallow tides rose and fell with vague lassitude, following the</p>
<p>impulse of prevailing winds more than the strong attraction of the</p>
<p>moon.  But now the unsailed harbour was quite still, in the pause of</p>
<p>the evening; and the smooth undulations were caressed by a hundred</p>
<p>opalescent hues, growing deeper toward the west, where the river</p>
<p>came in.  Converging lines of trees stood dark against the sky; a</p>
<p>cleft in the woods marked the course of the stream, above which the</p>
<p>reluctant splendours of an autumnal day were dying in ashes of</p>
<p>roses, while three tiny clouds, poised high in air, burned red with</p>
<p>the last glimpse of the departed sun.</p>
<p>On the right was a reedy point running out into the bay, and behind</p>
<p>it, on a slight rise of ground, an antique house with tall white</p>
<p>pillars.  It was but dimly outlined in the gathering shadows; yet</p>
<p>one could imagine its stately, formal aspect, its precise garden</p>
<p>with beds of old-fashioned flowers and straight paths bordered with</p>
<p>box, and a little arbour overgrown with honeysuckle.  I know not by</p>
<p>what subtlety of delicate and indescribable touches--a slight</p>
<p>inclination in one of the pillars, a broken line which might</p>
<p>indicate an unhinged gate, a drooping resignation in the foliage of</p>
<p>the yellowing trees, a tone of sadness in the blending of subdued</p>
<p>colours--the painter had suggested that the place was deserted.  But</p>
<p>the truth was unmistakable.  An air of loneliness and pensive sorrow</p>
<p>breathed from the picture; a sigh of longing and regret.  It was</p>
<p>haunted by sad, sweet memories of some untold story of human life.</p>
<p>In the corner Falconer had put his signature, T. F., &quot;LARMONE,&quot; 189-,</p>
<p>and on the border of the picture he had faintly traced some words,</p>
<p>which we made out at last--</p>

<p>&quot;That is very pretty poetry, gentlemen,&quot; said Morgenstern, who had</p>
<p>come in behind us, &quot;but is it not a little vague?  You like it, but</p>
<p>you cannot tell exactly what it means.  I find the same fault in the</p>
<p>picture from my point of view.  There is nothing in it to make a</p>
<p>paragraph about, no anecdote, no experiment in technique.  It is</p>
<p>impossible to persuade the public to admire a picture unless you can</p>
<p>tell them precisely the points on which they must fix their</p>
<p>admiration.  And that is why, although the painting is a good one, I</p>
<p>should be willing to sell it at a low price.&quot;</p>
<p>He named a sum of money in three figures, so small that Pierrepont,</p>
<p>who often buys pictures by proxy, could not conceal his surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly I should consider that a good bargain, simply for</p>
<p>investment,&quot; said he.  &quot;Falconer&#x27;s name alone ought to be worth more</p>
<p>than that, ten years from now.  He is a rising man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Mr. Pierrepont,&quot; replied the dealer, &quot;the picture is worth what</p>
<p>I ask for it, for I would not commit the impertinence of offering a</p>
<p>present to you or your friend; but it is worth no more.  Falconer&#x27;s</p>
<p>name will not increase in value.  The catalogue of his works is too</p>
<p>short for fame to take much notice of it; and this is the last.  Did</p>
<p>you not hear of his death last fall?  I do not wonder, for it</p>
<p>happened at some place down on Long Island--a name that I never saw</p>
<p>before, and have forgotten now.  There was not even an obituary in</p>
<p>the newspapers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And besides,&quot; he continued, after a pause, &quot;I must not conceal from</p>
<p>you that the painting has a blemish.  It is not always visible,</p>
<p>since you have failed to detect it; but it is more noticeable in</p>
<p>some lights than in others; and, do what I will, I cannot remove it.</p>
<p>This alone would prevent the painting from being a good investment.</p>
<p>Its market value will never rise.&quot;</p>
<p>He turned the canvas sideways to the light, and the defect became</p>
<p>apparent.</p>
<p>It was a dim, oblong, white blot in the middle distance; a nebulous</p>
<p>blur in the painting, as if there had been some chemical impurity in</p>
<p>the pigment causing it to fade, or rather as if a long drop of some</p>
<p>acid, or perhaps a splash of salt water, had fallen upon the canvas</p>
<p>while it was wet, and bleached it.  I knew little of the possible</p>
<p>causes of such a blot, but enough to see that it could not be erased</p>
<p>without painting over it, perhaps not even then.  And yet it seemed</p>
<p>rather to enhance than to weaken the attraction which the picture</p>
<p>had for me.</p>
<p>&quot;Your candour does you credit, Mr. Morgenstern,&quot; said I, &quot;but you</p>
<p>know me well enough to be sure that what you have said will hardly</p>
<p>discourage me.  For I have never been an admirer of &#x27;cabinet finish&#x27;</p>
<p>in works of art.  Nor have I been in the habit of buying them, as a</p>
<p>Circassian father trains his daughters, with an eye to the market.</p>
<p>They come into my house for my own pleasure, and when the time</p>
<p>arrives that I can see them no longer, it will not matter much to me</p>
<p>what price they bring in the auction-room.  This landscape pleases</p>
<p>me so thoroughly that, if you will let us take it with us this</p>
<p>evening, I will send you a check for the amount in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>So we carried off the painting in a cab; and all the way home I was</p>
<p>in the pleasant excitement of a man who is about to make an addition</p>
<p>to his house; while Pierrepont was conscious of the glow of virtue</p>
<p>which comes of having done a favour to a friend and justified your</p>
<p>own critical judgment at one stroke.</p>
<p>After dinner we hung the painting over the chimney-piece in the room</p>
<p>called the study (because it was consecrated to idleness), and sat</p>
<p>there far into the night, talking of the few times we had met</p>
<p>Falconer at the club, and of his reticent manner, which was broken</p>
<p>by curious flashes of impersonal confidence when he spoke not of</p>
<p>himself but of his art.  From this we drifted into memories of good</p>
<p>comrades who had walked beside us but a few days in the path of</p>
<p>life, and then disappeared, yet left us feeling as if we cared more</p>
<p>for them than for the men whom we see every day; and of young</p>
<p>geniuses who had never reached the goal; and of many other glimpses</p>
<p>of &quot;the light that failed,&quot; until the lamp was low and it was time</p>
<p>to say good-night.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>For several months I continued to advance in intimacy with my</p>
<p>picture.  It grew more familiar, more suggestive; the truth and</p>
<p>beauty of it came home to me constantly.  Yet there was something in</p>
<p>it not quite apprehended; a sense of strangeness; a reserve which I</p>
<p>had not yet penetrated.</p>
<p>One night in August I found myself practically alone, so far as</p>
<p>human intercourse was concerned, in the populous, weary city.  A</p>
<p>couple of hours of writing had produced nothing that would bear the</p>
<p>test of sunlight, so I anticipated judgment by tearing up the</p>
<p>spoiled sheets of paper, and threw myself upon the couch before the</p>
<p>empty fireplace.  It was a dense, sultry night, with electricity</p>
<p>thickening the air, and a trouble of distant thunder rolling far</p>
<p>away on the rim of the cloudy sky--one of those nights of restless</p>
<p>dulness, when you wait and long for something to happen, and yet</p>
<p>feel despondently that nothing ever will happen again.  I passed</p>
<p>through a region of aimless thoughts into one of migratory and</p>
<p>unfinished dreams, and dropped from that into an empty gulf of</p>
<p>sleep.</p>
<p>How late it was when I drifted back toward the shore of</p>
<p>consciousness, I cannot tell.  But the student-lamp on the table had</p>
<p>burned out, and the light of the gibbous moon was creeping in</p>
<p>through the open windows.  Slowly the pale illumination crept up the</p>
<p>eastern wall, like a tide rising as the moon declined.  Now it</p>
<p>reached the mantel-shelf and overflowed the bronze heads of Homer</p>
<p>and the Indian Bacchus and the Egyptian image of Isis with the</p>
<p>infant Horus.  Now it touched the frame of the picture and lapped</p>
<p>over the edge.  Now it rose to the shadowy house and the dim garden,</p>
<p>in the midst of which I saw the white blot more distinctly than ever</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>It seemed now to have taken a new shape, like the slender form of a</p>
<p>woman, robed in flowing white.  And as I watched it through half-</p>
<p>closed eyes, the figure appeared to move and tremble and wave to and</p>
<p>fro, as if it were a ghost.</p>
<p>A haunted picture!  Why should it not be so?  A haunted ruin, a</p>
<p>haunted forest, a haunted ship,--all these have been seen, or</p>
<p>imagined, and reported, and there are learned societies for</p>
<p>investigating such things.  Why should not a picture have a ghost in</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>My mind, in that curiously vivid state which lies between waking and</p>
<p>sleeping, went through the form of careful reasoning over the</p>
<p>question.  If there may be some subtle connection between a house</p>
<p>and the spirits of the people who have once lived in it,--and wise</p>
<p>men have believed this,--why should there be any impassable gulf</p>
<p>between a picture and the vanished lives out of which it has grown?</p>
<p>All the human thought and feeling which have passed into it through</p>
<p>the patient toil of art, remain forever embodied there.  A picture</p>
<p>is the most living and personal thing that a man can leave behind</p>
<p>him.  When we look at it we see what he saw, hour after hour, day</p>
<p>after day, and we see it through his mood and impression, coloured</p>
<p>by his emotion, tinged with his personality.  Surely, if the spirits</p>
<p>of the dead are not extinguished, but only veiled and hidden, and if</p>
<p>it were possible by any means that their presence could flash for a</p>
<p>moment through the veil, it would be most natural that they should</p>
<p>come back again to hover around the work into which their experience</p>
<p>and passion had been woven.  Here, if anywhere, they would &quot;Revisit</p>
<p>the pale glimpses of the moon.&quot;  Here, if anywhere, we might catch</p>
<p>fleeting sight, as in a glass darkly, of the visions that passed</p>
<p>before them while they worked.</p>
<p>This much of my train of reasoning along the edge of the dark, I</p>
<p>remember sharply.  But after this, all was confused and misty.  The</p>
<p>shore of consciousness receded.  I floated out again on the ocean of</p>
<p>forgotten dreams.  When I woke, it was with a quick start, as if my</p>
<p>ship had been made fast, silently and suddenly, at the wharf of</p>
<p>reality, and the bell rang for me to step ashore.</p>
<p>But the vision of the white blot remained clear and distinct.  And</p>
<p>the question that it had brought to me, the chain of thoughts that</p>
<p>had linked themselves to it, lingered through the morning, and made</p>
<p>me feel sure that there was an untold secret in Falconer&#x27;s life and</p>
<p>that the clew to it must be sought in the history of his last</p>
<p>picture.</p>
<p>But how to trace the connection?  Every one who had known Falconer,</p>
<p>however slightly, was out of town.  There was no clew to follow.</p>
<p>Even the name &quot;Larmone&quot; gave me no help; for I could not find it on</p>
<p>any map of Long Island.  It was probably the fanciful title of some</p>
<p>old country-place, familiar only to the people who had lived there.</p>
<p>But the very remoteness of the problem, its lack of contact with the</p>
<p>practical world, fascinated me.  It was like something that had</p>
<p>drifted away in the fog, on a sea of unknown and fluctuating</p>
<p>currents.  The only possible way to find it was to commit yourself</p>
<p>to the same wandering tides and drift after it, trusting to a</p>
<p>propitious fortune that you might be carried in the same direction;</p>
<p>and after a long, blind, unhurrying chase, one day you might feel a</p>
<p>faint touch, a jar, a thrill along the side of your boat, and,</p>
<p>peering through the fog, lay your hand at last, without surprise,</p>
<p>upon the very object of your quest.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>As it happened, the means for such a quest were at my disposal.  I</p>
<p>was part owner of a boat which had been built for hunting and</p>
<p>fishing cruises on the shallow waters of the Great South Bay.  It</p>
<p>was a deliberate, but not inconvenient, craft, well named the</p>
<p>Patience; and my turn for using it had come.  Black Zekiel, the</p>
<p>captain, crew, and cook, was the very man that I would have chosen</p>
<p>for such an expedition.  He combined the indolent good-humour of the</p>
<p>negro with the taciturnity of the Indian, and knew every shoal and</p>
<p>channel of the tortuous waters.  He asked nothing better than to set</p>
<p>out on a voyage without a port; sailing aimlessly eastward day after</p>
<p>day, through the long chain of landlocked bays, with the sea</p>
<p>plunging behind the sand-dunes on our right, and the shores of Long</p>
<p>Island sleeping on our left; anchoring every evening in some little</p>
<p>cove or estuary, where Zekiel could sit on the cabin roof, smoking</p>
<p>his corn-cob pipe, and meditating on the vanity and comfort of life,</p>
<p>while I pushed off through the mellow dusk to explore every creek</p>
<p>and bend of the shore, in my light canoe.</p>
<p>There was nothing to hasten our voyage.  The three weeks&#x27; vacation</p>
<p>was all but gone, when the Patience groped her way through a narrow,</p>
<p>crooked channel in a wide salt-meadow, and entered the last of the</p>
<p>series of bays.  A few houses straggled down a point of land; the</p>
<p>village of Quantock lay a little farther back.  Beyond that was a</p>
<p>belt of woods reaching to the water; and from these the south-</p>
<p>country road emerged to cross the upper end of the bay on a low</p>
<p>causeway with a narrow bridge of planks at the central point.  Here</p>
<p>was our Ultima Thule.  Not even the Patience could thread the eye of</p>
<p>this needle, or float through the shallow marsh-canal farther to the</p>
<p>east.</p>
<p>We anchored just in front of the bridge, and as I pushed the canoe</p>
<p>beneath it, after supper, I felt the indefinable sensation of having</p>
<p>passed that way before.  I knew beforehand what the little boat</p>
<p>would drift into.  The broad saffron light of evening fading over a</p>
<p>still lagoon; two converging lines of pine trees running back into</p>
<p>the sunset; a grassy point upon the right; and behind that a</p>
<p>neglected garden, a tangled bower of honeysuckle, a straight path</p>
<p>bordered with box, leading to a deserted house with a high, white-</p>
<p>pillared porch--yes, it was Larmone.</p>
<p>In the morning I went up to the village to see if I could find trace</p>
<p>of my artist&#x27;s visit to the place.  There was no difficulty in the</p>
<p>search, for he had been there often.  The people had plenty of</p>
<p>recollections of him, but no real memory, for it seemed as if none</p>
<p>of them had really known him.</p>
<p>&quot;Queer kinder fellow,&quot; said a wrinkled old bayman with whom I walked</p>
<p>up the sandy road, &quot;I seen him a good deal round here, but &#x27;twan&#x27;t</p>
<p>like havin&#x27; any &#x27;quaintance with him.  He allus kep&#x27; himself to</p>
<p>himself, pooty much.  Used ter stay round &#x27;Squire Ladoo&#x27;s place most</p>
<p>o&#x27; the time--keepin&#x27; comp&#x27;ny with the gal I guess.  Larmone?  Yaas,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s what THEY called it, but we don&#x27;t go much on fancy names down</p>
<p>here.  No, the painter didn&#x27; &#x27;zactly live there, but it &#x27;mounted to</p>
<p>the same thing.  Las&#x27; summer they was all away, house shet up,</p>
<p>painter hangin&#x27; round all the time, &#x27;s if he looked fur &#x27;em to come</p>
<p>back any minnit.  Purfessed to be paintin&#x27;, but I don&#x27; see&#x27;s he did</p>
<p>much.  Lived up to Mort Halsey&#x27;s; died there too; year ago this</p>
<p>fall.  Guess Mis&#x27; Halsey can tell ye most of any one &#x27;bout him.&quot;</p>
<p>At the boarding-house (with wide, low verandas, now forsaken by the</p>
<p>summer boarders), which did duty for a village inn, I found Mrs.</p>
<p>Halsey; a notable housewife, with a strong taste for ancestry, and</p>
<p>an uncultivated world of romance still brightening her soft brown</p>
<p>eyes.  She knew all the threads in the story that I was following;</p>
<p>and the interest with which she spoke made it evident that she had</p>
<p>often woven them together in the winter evenings on patterns of her</p>
<p>own.</p>
<p>Judge Ledoux had come to Quantock from the South during the war, and</p>
<p>built a house there like the one he used to live in.  There were</p>
<p>three things he hated: slavery and war and society.  But he always</p>
<p>loved the South more than the North, and lived like a foreigner,</p>
<p>polite enough, but very retired.  His wife died after a few years,</p>
<p>and left him alone with a little girl.  Claire grew up as pretty as</p>
<p>a picture, but very shy and delicate.  About two years ago Mr.</p>
<p>Falconer had come down from the city; he stayed at Larmone first,</p>
<p>and then he came to the boarding-house, but he was over at the</p>
<p>Ledoux&#x27; house almost all the time.  He was a Southerner too, and a</p>
<p>relative of the family; a real gentleman, and very proud though he</p>
<p>was poor.  It seemed strange that he should not live with them, but</p>
<p>perhaps he felt more free over here.  Every one thought he must be</p>
<p>engaged to Claire, but he was not the kind of a man that you could</p>
<p>ask questions about himself.  A year ago last winter he had gone up</p>
<p>to the city and taken all his things with him.  He had never stayed</p>
<p>away so long before.  In the spring the Ledoux had gone to Europe;</p>
<p>Claire seemed to be falling into a decline; her sight seemed to be</p>
<p>failing, and her father said she must see a famous doctor and have a</p>
<p>change of air.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Falconer came back in May,&quot; continued the good lady, &quot;as if he</p>
<p>expected to find them.  But the house was shut up and nobody knew</p>
<p>just where they were.  He seemed to be all taken aback; it was queer</p>
<p>if he didn&#x27;t know about it, intimate as he had been; but he never</p>
<p>said anything, and made no inquiries; just seemed to be waiting, as</p>
<p>if there was nothing else for him to do.  We would have told him in</p>
<p>a minute, if we had anything to tell.  But all we could do was to</p>
<p>guess there must have been some kind of a quarrel between him and</p>
<p>the Judge, and if there was, he must know best about it himself.</p>
<p>&quot;All summer long he kept going over to the house and wandering</p>
<p>around in the garden.  In the fall he began to paint a picture, but</p>
<p>it was very slow painting; he would go over in the afternoon and</p>
<p>come back long after dark, damp with the dew and fog.  He kept</p>
<p>growing paler and weaker and more silent.  Some days he did not</p>
<p>speak more than a dozen words, but always kind and pleasant.  He was</p>
<p>just dwindling away; and when the picture was almost done a fever</p>
<p>took hold of him.  The doctor said it was malaria, but it seemed to</p>
<p>me more like a trouble in the throat, a kind of dumb misery.  And</p>
<p>one night, in the third quarter of the moon, just after the tide</p>
<p>turned to run out, he raised up in the bed and tried to speak, but</p>
<p>he was gone.</p>
<p>&quot;We tried to find out his relations, but there didn&#x27;t seem to be</p>
<p>any, except the Ledoux, and they were out of reach.  So we sent the</p>
<p>picture up to our cousin in Brooklyn, and it sold for about enough</p>
<p>to pay Mr. Falconer&#x27;s summer&#x27;s board and the cost of his funeral.</p>
<p>There was nothing else that he left of any value, except a few</p>
<p>books; perhaps you would like to look at them, if you were his</p>
<p>friend?</p>
<p>&quot;I never saw any one that I seemed to know so little and like so</p>
<p>well.  It was a disappointment in love, of course, and they all said</p>
<p>that he died of a broken heart; but I think it was because his heart</p>
<p>was too full, and wouldn&#x27;t break.</p>
<p>&quot;And oh!--I forgot to tell you; a week after he was gone there was a</p>
<p>notice in the paper that Claire Ledoux had died suddenly, on the</p>
<p>last of August, at some place in Switzerland.  Her father is still</p>
<p>away travelling.  And so the whole story is broken off and will</p>
<p>never be finished.  Will you look at the books?&quot;</p>
<p>Nothing is more pathetic, to my mind, than to take up the books of</p>
<p>one who is dead.  Here is his name, with perhaps a note of the place</p>
<p>where the volume was bought or read, and the marks on the pages that</p>
<p>he liked best.  Here are the passages that gave him pleasure, and</p>
<p>the thoughts that entered into his life and formed it; they became</p>
<p>part of him, but where has he carried them now?</p>
<p>Falconer&#x27;s little library was an unstudied choice, and gave a hint</p>
<p>of his character.  There was a New Testament in French, with his</p>
<p>name written in a slender, woman&#x27;s hand; three or four volumes of</p>
<p>stories, Cable&#x27;s &quot;Old Creole Days,&quot; Allen&#x27;s &quot;Kentucky Cardinal,&quot;</p>
<p>Page&#x27;s &quot;In Old Virginia,&quot; and the like; &quot;Henry Esmond&quot; and Amiel&#x27;s</p>
<p>&quot;Journal&quot; and Lamartine&#x27;s &quot;Raphael&quot;; and a few volumes of poetry,</p>
<p>among them one of Sidney Lanier&#x27;s, and one of Tennyson&#x27;s earlier</p>
<p>poems.</p>
<p>There was also a little morocco-bound book of manuscript notes.</p>
<p>This I begged permission to carry away with me, hoping to find in it</p>
<p>something which would throw light upon my picture, perhaps even some</p>
<p>message to be carried, some hint or suggestion of something which</p>
<p>the writer would fain have had done for him, and which I promised</p>
<p>myself faithfully to perform, as a test of an imagined friendship--</p>
<p>imagined not in the future, but in the impossible past.</p>
<p>I read the book in this spirit, searching its pages carefully,</p>
<p>through the long afternoon, in the solitary cabin of my boat.  There</p>
<p>was nothing at first but an ordinary diary; a record of the work and</p>
<p>self-denials of a poor student of art.  Then came the date of his</p>
<p>first visit to Larmone, and an expression of the pleasure of being</p>
<p>with his own people again after a lonely life, and some chronicle of</p>
<p>his occupations there, studies for pictures, and idle days that were</p>
<p>summed up in a phrase: &quot;On the bay,&quot; or &quot;In the woods.&quot;</p>
<p>After this the regular succession of dates was broken, and there</p>
<p>followed a few scraps of verse, irregular and unfinished, bound</p>
<p>together by the thread of a name--&quot;Claire among her Roses,&quot; &quot;A Ride</p>
<p>through the Pines with Claire,&quot; &quot;An Old Song of Claire&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The Blue</p>
<p>Flower in Claire&#x27;s Eyes.&quot;  It was not poetry, but such an</p>
<p>unconscious tribute to the power and beauty of poetry as unfolds</p>
<p>itself almost inevitably from youthful love, as naturally as the</p>
<p>blossoms unfold from the apple trees in May.  If you pick them they</p>
<p>are worthless.  They charm only in their own time and place.</p>
<p>A date told of his change from Larmone to the village, and this was</p>
<p>written below it: &quot;Too heavy a sense of obligation destroys freedom,</p>
<p>and only a free man can dare to love.&quot;</p>
<p>Then came a number of fragments indicating trouble of mind and</p>
<p>hesitation; the sensitiveness of the artist, the delicate, self-</p>
<p>tormenting scruples of the lonely idealist, the morbid pride of the</p>
<p>young poor man, contending with an impetuous passion and forcing it</p>
<p>to surrender, or at least to compromise.</p>
<p>&quot;What right has a man to demand everything and offer nothing in</p>
<p>return except an ambition and a hope?  Love must come as a giver,</p>
<p>not as a beggar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A knight should not ask to wear his lady&#x27;s colours until he has won</p>
<p>his spurs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;King Cophetua and the beggar-maid--very fine! but the other way--</p>
<p>humiliating!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A woman may take everything from a man, wealth and fame and</p>
<p>position.  But there is only one thing that a man may accept from a</p>
<p>woman--something that she alone can give--happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Self-respect is less than love, but it is the trellis that holds</p>
<p>love up from the ground; break it down, and all the flowers are in</p>
<p>the dust, the fruit is spoiled.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet&quot;--so the man&#x27;s thought shone through everywhere--&quot;I think</p>
<p>she must know that I love her, and why I cannot speak.&quot;</p>
<p>One entry was written in a clearer, stronger hand: &quot;An end of</p>
<p>hesitation.  The longest way is the shortest.  I am going to the</p>
<p>city to work for the Academy prize, to think of nothing else until I</p>
<p>win it, and then come back with it to Claire, to tell her that I</p>
<p>have a future, and that it is hers.  If I spoke of it now it would</p>
<p>be like claiming the reward before I had done the work.  I have told</p>
<p>her only that I am going to prove myself an artist, AND TO LIVE FOR</p>
<p>WHAT I LOVE BEST.  She understood, I am sure, for she would not lift</p>
<p>her eyes to me, but her hand trembled as she gave me the blue flower</p>
<p>from her belt.&quot;</p>
<p>The date of his return to Larmone was marked, but the page was</p>
<p>blank, as the day had been.</p>
<p>Some pages of dull self-reproach and questioning and bewildered</p>
<p>regret followed.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible that she has gone away, without a word, without a</p>
<p>sign, after what has passed between us?  It is not fair.  Surely I</p>
<p>had some claim.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But what claim, after all?  I asked for nothing.  And was it not</p>
<p>pride that kept me silent, taking it for granted that if I asked,</p>
<p>she would give?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was a mistake; she did not understand, nor care.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was my fault; I might at least have told her that I loved her,</p>
<p>though she could not have answered me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is too late now.  To-night, while I was finishing the picture, I</p>
<p>saw her in the garden.  Her spirit, all in white, with a blue flower</p>
<p>in her belt.  I knew she was dead across the sea.  I tried to call</p>
<p>to her, but my voice made no sound.  She seemed not to see me.  She</p>
<p>moved like one in a dream, straight on, and vanished.  Is there no</p>
<p>one who can tell her?  Must she never know that I loved her?&quot;</p>
<p>The last thing in the book was a printed scrap of paper that lay</p>
<p>between the leaves:</p>

<p>So there was a message after all, but it could never be carried; a</p>
<p>task for a friend, but it was impossible.  What better thing could I</p>
<p>do with the poor little book than bury it in the garden in the</p>
<p>shadow of Larmone?  The story of a silent fault, hidden in silence.</p>
<p>How many of life&#x27;s deepest tragedies are only that: no great</p>
<p>transgression, no shock of conflict, no sudden catastrophe with its</p>
<p>answering thrill of courage and resistance: only a mistake made in</p>
<p>the darkness, and under the guidance of what seemed a true and noble</p>
<p>motive; a failure to see the right path at the right moment, and a</p>
<p>long wandering beyond it; a word left unspoken until the ears that</p>
<p>should have heard it are sealed, and the tongue that should have</p>
<p>spoken it is dumb.</p>
<p>The soft sea-fog clothed the night with clinging darkness; the faded</p>
<p>leaves hung slack and motionless from the trees, waiting for their</p>
<p>fall; the tense notes of the surf beyond the sand-dunes vibrated</p>
<p>through the damp air like chords from some mighty VIOLONO; large,</p>
<p>warm drops wept from the arbour while I sat in the garden, holding</p>
<p>the poor little book, and thinking of the white blot in the record</p>
<p>of a life that was too proud to bend to the happiness that was meant</p>
<p>for it.</p>
<p>There are men like that: not many perhaps, but a few; and they are</p>
<p>the ones who suffer most keenly in this world of half-understanding</p>
<p>and clouded knowledge.  There is a pride, honourable and sensitive,</p>
<p>that imperils the realization of love, puts it under a spell of</p>
<p>silence and reserve, makes it sterile of blossoms and impotent of</p>
<p>fruits.  For what is it, after all, but a subtle, spiritual worship</p>
<p>of self?  And what was Falconer&#x27;s resolve not to tell this girl that</p>
<p>he loved her until he had won fame and position, but a secret,</p>
<p>unconscious setting of himself above her?  For surely, if love is</p>
<p>supreme, it does not need to wait for anything else to lend it worth</p>
<p>and dignity.  The very sweetness and power of it lie in the</p>
<p>confession of one life as dependent upon another for its fulfilment.</p>
<p>It is made strong in its very weakness.  It is the only thing, after</p>
<p>all, that can break the prison bars and set the heart free from</p>
<p>itself.  The pride that hinders it, enslaves it.  Love&#x27;s first duty</p>
<p>is to be true to itself, in word and deed.  Then, having spoken</p>
<p>truth and acted verity, it may call on honour to keep it pure and</p>
<p>steadfast.</p>
<p>If Falconer had trusted Claire, and showed her his heart without</p>
<p>reserve, would she not have understood him and helped him?  It was</p>
<p>the pride of independence, the passion of self-reliance that drew</p>
<p>him away from her and divided his heart from hers in a dumb</p>
<p>isolation.  But Claire,--was not she also in fault?  Might she not</p>
<p>have known, should not she have taken for granted, the truth which</p>
<p>must have been so easy to read in Falconer&#x27;s face, though he never</p>
<p>put it into words?  And yet with her there was something very</p>
<p>different from the pride that kept him silent.  The virgin reserve</p>
<p>of a young girl&#x27;s heart is more sacred than any pride of self.  It</p>
<p>is the maiden instinct which makes the woman always the shrine, and</p>
<p>never the pilgrim.  She is not the seeker, but the one sought.  She</p>
<p>dares not take anything for granted.  She has the right to wait for</p>
<p>the voice, the word, the avowal.  Then, and not till then, if the</p>
<p>pilgrim be the chosen one, the shrine may open to receive him.</p>
<p>Not all women believe this; but those who do are the ones best worth</p>
<p>seeking and winning.  And Claire was one of them.  It seemed to me,</p>
<p>as I mused, half dreaming, on the unfinished story of these two</p>
<p>lives that had missed each other in the darkness, that I could see</p>
<p>her figure moving through the garden, beyond where the pallid bloom</p>
<p>of the tall cosmos-flower bent to the fitful breeze.  Her robe was</p>
<p>like the waving of the mist.  Her face was fair, and very fair, for</p>
<p>all its sadness: a blue flower, faint as a shadow on the snow,</p>
<p>trembled at her waist, as she paced to and fro along the path.</p>
<p>I murmured to myself, &quot;Yet he loved her: and she loved him.  Can</p>
<p>pride be stronger than love?&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, the lingering and belated confession which</p>
<p>Falconer had written in his diary might in some way come to her.</p>
<p>Perhaps if it were left here in the bower of honeysuckles where they</p>
<p>had so often sat together, it might be a sign and omen of the</p>
<p>meeting of these two souls that had lost each other in the dark of</p>
<p>the world.  Perhaps,--ah, who can tell that it is not so?--for those</p>
<p>who truly love, with all their errors, with all their faults, there</p>
<p>is no &quot;irrevocable&quot;--there is &quot;another field.&quot;</p>
<p>As I turned from the garden, the tense note of the surf vibrated</p>
<p>through the night.  The pattering drops of dew rustled as they fell</p>
<p>from the leaves of the honeysuckle.  But underneath these sounds it</p>
<p>seemed as if I heard a deep voice saying &quot;Claire!&quot; and a woman&#x27;s</p>
<p>lips whispering &quot;Temple!&quot;</p>
<p>A YEAR OF NOBILITY</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>ENTER THE MARQUIS</p>
<p>The Marquis sat by the camp-fire peeling potatoes.</p>
<p>To look at him, you never would have taken him for a marquis.  His</p>
<p>costume was a pair of corduroy trousers; a blue flannel shirt,</p>
<p>patched at elbows with gray; lumberman&#x27;s boots, flat-footed,</p>
<p>shapeless, with loose leather legs strapped just below the knee, and</p>
<p>wrinkled like the hide of an ancient rhinoceros; and a soft brown</p>
<p>hat with several holes in the crown, as if it had done duty, at some</p>
<p>time in its history, as an impromptu target in a shooting-match.  A</p>
<p>red woollen scarf twisted about his loins gave a touch of colour and</p>
<p>picturesqueness.</p>
<p>It was not exactly a court dress, but it sat well on the powerful</p>
<p>sinewy figure of the man.  He never gave a thought to his looks, but</p>
<p>peeled his potatoes with a dexterity which betrayed a past-master of</p>
<p>the humble art, and threw the skins into the fire.</p>
<p>&quot;Look you, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; he said to young Winthrop Alden, who sat on a</p>
<p>fallen tree near him, mending the fly-rod which he had broken in the</p>
<p>morning&#x27;s fishing, &quot;look you, it is an affair of the most strange,</p>
<p>yet of the most certain.  We have known always that ours was a good</p>
<p>family.  The name tells it.  The Lamottes are of la haute classe in</p>
<p>France.  But here, in Canada, we are poor.  Yet the good blood dies</p>
<p>not with the poverty.  It is buried, hidden, but it remains the</p>
<p>same.  It is like these pataques.  You plant good ones for seed: you</p>
<p>get a good crop.  You plant bad ones: you get a bad crop.  But we</p>
<p>did not know about the title in our family.  No.  We thought ours</p>
<p>was a side-branch, an off-shoot.  It was a great surprise to us.</p>
<p>But it is certain,--beyond a doubt.&quot;</p>
<p>Jean Lamotte&#x27;s deep voice was quiet and steady.  It had the tone of</p>
<p>assured conviction.  His bright blue eyes above his ruddy mustache</p>
<p>and bronzed cheeks, were clear and tranquil as those of a child.</p>
<p>Alden was immensely interested and amused.  He was a member of the</p>
<p>Boston branch of the Society for Ancestral Culture, and he</p>
<p>recognized the favourite tenet of his sect,--the doctrine that</p>
<p>&quot;blood will tell.&quot;  He was also a Harvard man, knowing almost</p>
<p>everything and believing hardly anything.  Heredity was one of the</p>
<p>few unquestioned articles of his creed.  But the form in which this</p>
<p>familiar confession of faith came to him, on the banks of the Grande</p>
<p>Decharge, from the lips of a somewhat ragged and distinctly</p>
<p>illiterate Canadian guide, was grotesque enough to satisfy the most</p>
<p>modern taste for new sensations.  He listened with an air of</p>
<p>gravity, and a delighted sense of the humour of the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;How did you find it out?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; continued Jean, &quot;I will tell you how the news came to</p>
<p>me.  It was at St. Gedeon, one Sunday last March.  The snow was good</p>
<p>and hard, and I drove in, ten miles on the lake, from our house</p>
<p>opposite Grosse Ile.  After mass, a man, evidently of the city,</p>
<p>comes to me in the stable while I feed the horse, and salutes me.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Is this Jean Lamotte?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;At your service, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Son of Francois Louis Lamotte?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Of no other.  But he is dead, God give him repose.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;I been looking for you all through Charlevoix and Chicoutimi.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Here you find me then, and good-day to you,&#x27; says I, a little</p>
<p>short, for I was beginning to be shy of him.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Chut, chut,&#x27; says he, very friendly.  &#x27;I suppose you have time to</p>
<p>talk a bit.  How would you like to be a marquis and have a castle in</p>
<p>France with a hundred thousand dollars?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;For a moment I think I will lick him; then I laugh.  &#x27;Very well</p>
<p>indeed,&#x27; says I, &#x27;and also a handful of stars for buckshot, and the</p>
<p>new moon for a canoe.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;But no,&#x27; answers the man.  &#x27;I am earnest, Monsieur Lamotte.  I</p>
<p>want to talk a long talk with you.  Do you permit that I accompany</p>
<p>you to your residence?&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Residence!  You know that little farm-house of logs where my mother</p>
<p>lives,--you saw it last summer.  But of course it is a pretty good</p>
<p>house.  It is clean.  It is warm.  So I bring the man home in the</p>
<p>sleigh.  All that evening he tells the story.  How our name Lamotte</p>
<p>is really De la Motte de la Luciere.  How there belongs to that name</p>
<p>an estate and a title in France, now thirty years with no one to</p>
<p>claim it.  How he, being an AVOCAT, has remarked the likeness of the</p>
<p>names.  How he has tracked the family through Montmorency and</p>
<p>Quebec, in all the parish books.  How he finds my great-</p>
<p>grandfather&#x27;s great-grandfather, Etienne de La Motte who came to</p>
<p>Canada two hundred years ago, a younger son of the Marquis de la</p>
<p>Luciere.  How he has the papers, many of them, with red seals on</p>
<p>them.  I saw them.  &#x27;Of course,&#x27; says he, &#x27;there are others of the</p>
<p>family here to share the property.  It must be divided.  But it is</p>
<p>large--enormous--millions of francs.  And the largest share is</p>
<p>yours, and the title, and a castle--a castle larger than Price&#x27;s</p>
<p>saw-mill at Chicoutimi; with carpets, and electric lights, and</p>
<p>coloured pictures on the wall, like the hotel at Roberval.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;When my mother heard about that she was pleased.  But me--when I</p>
<p>heard that I was a marquis, I knew it was true.&quot;</p>
<p>Jean&#x27;s blue eyes were wide open now, and sparkling brightly.  He had</p>
<p>put down the pan of potatoes.  He was holding his head up and</p>
<p>talking eagerly.</p>
<p>Alden turned away his face to light his pipe, and hide a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Did he get--any money--out of you?&quot;--came slowly between the puffs</p>
<p>of smoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Money!&quot; answered Jean, &quot;of course there must be money to carry on</p>
<p>an affair of this kind.  There was seventy dollars that I had</p>
<p>cleaned up on the lumber-job last winter, and the mother had forty</p>
<p>dollars from the cow she sold in the fall.  A hundred and ten</p>
<p>dollars,--we gave him that.  He has gone to France to make the claim</p>
<p>for us.  Next spring he comes back, and I give him a hundred dollars</p>
<p>more; when I get my property five thousand dollars more.  It is</p>
<p>little enough.  A marquis must not be mean.&quot;</p>
<p>Alden swore softly in English, under his breath.  A rustic comedy, a</p>
<p>joke on human nature, always pleased him; but beneath his cynical</p>
<p>varnish he had a very honest heart, and he hated cruelty and</p>
<p>injustice.  He knew what a little money meant in the backwoods; what</p>
<p>hard and bitter toil it cost to rake it together; what sacrifices</p>
<p>and privations must follow its loss.  If the smooth prospector of</p>
<p>unclaimed estates in France had arrived at the camp on the Grande</p>
<p>Decharge at that moment, Alden would have introduced him to the most</p>
<p>unhappy hour of his life.</p>
<p>But with Jean Lamotte it was by no means so easy to deal.  Alden</p>
<p>perceived at once that ridicule would be worse than useless.  The</p>
<p>man was far too much in earnest.  A jest about a marquis with holes</p>
<p>in his hat!  Yes, Jean would laugh at that very merrily; for he was</p>
<p>a true VOYAGEUR.  But a jest about the reality of the marquis!  That</p>
<p>struck him as almost profane.  It was a fixed idea with him.</p>
<p>Argument could not shake it.  He had seen the papers.  He knew it</p>
<p>was true.  All the strength of his vigorous and healthy manhood</p>
<p>seemed to have gone into it suddenly, as if this was the news for</p>
<p>which he had been waiting, unconsciously, since he was born.</p>
<p>It was not in the least morbid, visionary, abstract.  It was</p>
<p>concrete, actual, and so far as Alden could see, wholesome.  It did</p>
<p>not make Jean despise his present life.  On the contrary, it</p>
<p>appeared to lend a zest to it, as an interesting episode in the</p>
<p>career of a nobleman.  He was not restless; he was not discontented.</p>
<p>His whole nature was at once elated and calmed.  He was not at all</p>
<p>feverish to get away from his familiar existence, from the woods and</p>
<p>the waters he knew so well, from the large liberty of the unpeopled</p>
<p>forest, the joyous rush of the great river, the splendid breadth of</p>
<p>the open sky.  Unconsciously these things had gone into his blood.</p>
<p>Dimly he felt the premonitions of homesickness for them all.  But he</p>
<p>was lifted up to remember that the blood into which these things had</p>
<p>entered was blue blood, and that though he lived in the wilderness</p>
<p>he really belonged to la haute classe.  A breath of romance, a</p>
<p>spirit of chivalry from the days when the high-spirited courtiers of</p>
<p>Louis XIV sought their fortune in the New World, seemed to pass into</p>
<p>him.  He spoke of it all with a kind of proud simplicity.</p>
<p>&quot;It appears curious to m&#x27;sieu&#x27;, no doubt, but it has been so in</p>
<p>Canada from the beginning.  There were many nobles here in the old</p>
<p>time.  Frontenac,--he was a duke or a prince.  Denonville,--he was a</p>
<p>grand seigneur.  La Salle, Vaudreuil,--these are all noble, counts</p>
<p>or barons.  I know not the difference, but the cure has told me the</p>
<p>names.  And the old Jacques Cartier, the father of all, when he went</p>
<p>home to France, I have heard that the King made him a lord and gave</p>
<p>him a castle.  Why not?  He was a capable man, a brave man; he could</p>
<p>sail a big ship, he could run the rapids of the great river in his</p>
<p>canoe.  He could hunt the bear, the lynx, the carcajou.  I suppose</p>
<p>all these men,--marquises and counts and barons,--I suppose they all</p>
<p>lived hard, and slept on the ground, and used the axe and the paddle</p>
<p>when they came to the woods.  It is not the fine coat that makes the</p>
<p>noble.  It is the good blood, the adventure, the brave heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Magnificent!&quot; thought Alden.  &quot;It is the real thing, a bit of the</p>
<p>seventeenth century lost in the forest for two hundred years.  It is</p>
<p>like finding an old rapier beside an Indian trail.  I suppose the</p>
<p>fellow may be the descendant of some gay young lieutenant of the</p>
<p>regiment Carignan-Salieres, who came out with De Tracy, or</p>
<p>Courcelles.  An amour with the daughter of a habitant,--a name taken</p>
<p>at random,--who can unravel the skein?  But here&#x27;s the old thread of</p>
<p>chivalry running through all the tangles, tarnished but unbroken.&quot;</p>
<p>This was what he said to himself.  What he said to Jean was, &quot;Well,</p>
<p>Jean, you and I have been together in the woods for two summers now,</p>
<p>and marquis or no marquis, I hope this is not going to make any</p>
<p>difference between us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But certainly NOT!&quot; answered Jean.  &quot;I am well content with</p>
<p>m&#x27;sieu&#x27;, as I hope m&#x27;sieu&#x27; is content with me.  While I am AU BOIS,</p>
<p>I ask no better than to be your guide.  Besides, I must earn those</p>
<p>other hundred dollars, for the payment in the spring.&quot;</p>
<p>Alden tried to make him promise to give nothing more to the lawyer</p>
<p>until he had something sure to show for his money.  But Jean was</p>
<p>politely non-committal on that point.  It was evident that he felt</p>
<p>the impossibility of meanness in a marquis.  Why should he be</p>
<p>sparing or cautious?  That was for the merchant, not for the noble.</p>
<p>A hundred, two hundred, three hundred dollars: What was that to an</p>
<p>estate and a title?  Nothing risk, nothing gain!  He must live up to</p>
<p>his role.  Meantime he was ready to prove that he was the best guide</p>
<p>on the Grande Decharge.</p>
<p>And so he was.  There was not a man in all the Lake St. John country</p>
<p>who knew the woods and waters as well as he did.  Far up the great</p>
<p>rivers Peribonca and Misstassini he had pushed his birch canoe,</p>
<p>exploring the network of lakes and streams along the desolate Height</p>
<p>of Land.  He knew the Grand Brule, where the bears roam in September</p>
<p>on the fire-scarred hills among the wide, unharvested fields of</p>
<p>blueberries.  He knew the hidden ponds and slow-creeping little</p>
<p>rivers where the beavers build their dams, and raise their silent</p>
<p>water-cities, like Venice lost in the woods.  He knew the vast</p>
<p>barrens, covered with stiff silvery moss, where the caribou fed in</p>
<p>the winter.  On the Decharge itself,--that tumultuous flood, never</p>
<p>failing, never freezing, by which the great lake pours all its</p>
<p>gathered waters in foam and fury down to the deep, still gorge of</p>
<p>the Saguenay,--there Jean was at home.  There was not a curl or eddy</p>
<p>in the wild course of the river that he did not understand.  The</p>
<p>quiet little channels by which one could drop down behind the</p>
<p>islands while the main stream made an impassable fall; the precise</p>
<p>height of the water at which it was safe to run the Rapide Gervais;</p>
<p>the point of rock on the brink of the Grande Chute where the canoe</p>
<p>must whirl swiftly in to the shore if you did not wish to go over</p>
<p>the cataract; the exact force of the tourniquet that sucked downward</p>
<p>at one edge of the rapid, and of the bouillon that boiled upward at</p>
<p>the other edge, as if the bottom of the river were heaving, and the</p>
<p>narrow line of the FILET D&#x27;EAU along which the birch-bark might</p>
<p>shoot in safety; the treachery of the smooth, oily curves where the</p>
<p>brown water swept past the edge of the cliff, silent, gloomy,</p>
<p>menacing; the hidden pathway through the foam where the canoe could</p>
<p>run out securely and reach a favourite haunt of the ouananiche, the</p>
<p>fish that loves the wildest water,--all these secrets were known to</p>
<p>Jean.  He read the river like a book.  He loved it.  He also</p>
<p>respected it.  He knew it too well to take liberties with it.</p>
<p>The camp, that June, was beside the Rapide des Cedres.  A great</p>
<p>ledge stretched across the river; the water came down in three</p>
<p>leaps, brown above, golden at the edge, white where it fell.  Below,</p>
<p>on the left bank, there was a little cove behind a high point of</p>
<p>rocks, a curving beach of white sand, a gentle slope of ground, a</p>
<p>tent half hidden among the birches and balsams.  Down the river, the</p>
<p>main channel narrowed and deepened.  High banks hemmed it in on the</p>
<p>left, iron-coasted islands on the right.  It was a sullen, powerful,</p>
<p>dangerous stream.  Beyond that, in mid-river, the Ile Maligne reared</p>
<p>its wicked head, scarred, bristling with skeletons of dead trees.</p>
<p>On either side of it, the river broke away into a long fury of</p>
<p>rapids and falls in which no boat could live.</p>
<p>It was there, on the point of the island, that the most famous</p>
<p>fishing in the river was found; and there Alden was determined to</p>
<p>cast his fly before he went home.  Ten days they had waited at the</p>
<p>Cedars for the water to fall enough to make the passage to the</p>
<p>island safe.  At last Alden grew impatient.  It was a superb</p>
<p>morning,--sky like an immense blue gentian, air full of fragrance</p>
<p>from a million bells of pink Linnaea, sunshine flattering the great</p>
<p>river,--a morning when danger and death seemed incredible.</p>
<p>&quot;To-day we are going to the island, Jean; the water must be low</p>
<p>enough now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not yet, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;, I am sorry, but it is not yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Alden laughed rather unpleasantly.  &quot;I believe you are afraid.  I</p>
<p>thought you were a good canoeman--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am that,&quot; said Jean, quietly, &quot;and therefore,--well, it is the</p>
<p>bad canoeman who is never afraid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But last September you took your monsieur to the island and gave</p>
<p>him fine fishing.  Why won&#x27;t you do it for me?  I believe you want</p>
<p>to keep me away from this place and save it for him.&quot;</p>
<p>Jean&#x27;s face flushed.  &quot;M&#x27;sieu&#x27; has no reason to say that of me.  I</p>
<p>beg that he will not repeat it.&quot;</p>
<p>Alden laughed again.  He was somewhat irritated at Jean for taking</p>
<p>the thing so seriously, for being so obstinate.  On such a morning</p>
<p>it was absurd.  At least it would do no harm to make an effort to</p>
<p>reach the island.  If it proved impossible they could give it up.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, Jean,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#x27;ll take it back.  You are only timid,</p>
<p>that&#x27;s all.  Francois here will go down with me.  We can manage the</p>
<p>canoe together.  Jean can stay at home and keep the camp.  Eh,</p>
<p>Francois?&quot;</p>
<p>Francois, the second guide, was a mush of vanity and good nature,</p>
<p>with just sense enough to obey Jean&#x27;s orders, and just jealousy</p>
<p>enough to make him jump at a chance to show his independence.  He</p>
<p>would like very well to be first man for a day,--perhaps for the</p>
<p>next trip, if he had good luck.  He grinned and nodded his head--</p>
<p>&quot;All ready, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;; I guess we can do it.&quot;</p>
<p>But while he was holding the canoe steady for Alden to step out to</p>
<p>his place in the bow, Jean came down and pushed him aside.  &quot;Go to</p>
<p>bed, dam&#x27; fool,&quot; he muttered, shoved the canoe out into the river,</p>
<p>and jumped lightly to his own place in the stern.</p>
<p>Alden smiled to himself and said nothing for a while.  When they</p>
<p>were a mile or two down the river he remarked, &quot;So I see you changed</p>
<p>your mind, Jean.  Do you think better of the river now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, m&#x27;sieu&#x27;, I think the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because I must share the luck with you whether it is good or bad.</p>
<p>It is no shame to have fear.  The shame is not to face it.  But one</p>
<p>thing I ask of you--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And that is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kneel as low in the canoe as you can, paddle steady, and do not</p>
<p>dodge when a wave comes.&quot;</p>
<p>Alden was half inclined to turn back, and give it up.  But pride</p>
<p>made it difficult to say the word.  Besides the fishing was sure to</p>
<p>be superb; not a line had been wet there since last year.  It was</p>
<p>worth a little risk.  The danger could not be so very great after</p>
<p>all.  How fair the river ran,--a current of living topaz between</p>
<p>banks of emerald!  What but good luck could come on such a day?</p>
<p>The canoe was gliding down the last smooth stretch.  Alden lifted</p>
<p>his head, as they turned the corner, and for the first time saw the</p>
<p>passage close before him.  His face went white, and he set his teeth.</p>
<p>The left-hand branch of the river, cleft by the rocky point of the</p>
<p>island, dropped at once into a tumult of yellow foam and raved</p>
<p>downward along the northern shore.  The right-hand branch swerved</p>
<p>away to the east, running with swift, silent fury.  On the lower</p>
<p>edge of this desperate race of brown billows, a huge whirlpool</p>
<p>formed and dissolved every two or three minutes, now eddying round</p>
<p>in a wide backwater into a rocky bay on the end of the island, now</p>
<p>swept away by the rush of waves into the white rage of the rapids</p>
<p>below.</p>
<p>There was the secret pathway.  The trick was, to dart across the</p>
<p>right-hand current at the proper moment, catch the rim of the</p>
<p>whirlpool as it swung backward, and let it sweep you around to the</p>
<p>end of the island.  It was easy enough at low water.  But now?</p>
<p>The smooth waves went crowding and shouldering down the slope as if</p>
<p>they were running to a fight.  The river rose and swelled with</p>
<p>quick, uneven passion.  The whirlpool was in its place one minute;</p>
<p>the next, it was blotted out; everything rushed madly downward--and</p>
<p>below was hell.</p>
<p>Jean checked the boat for a moment, quivering in the strong current,</p>
<p>waiting for the TOURNIQUET to form again.  Five seconds--ten</p>
<p>seconds--&quot;Now!&quot; he cried.</p>
<p>The canoe shot obliquely into the stream, driven by strong, quick</p>
<p>strokes of the paddles.  It seemed almost to leap from wave to wave.</p>
<p>All was going well.  The edge of the whirlpool was near.  Then came</p>
<p>the crest of a larger wave,--slap--into the boat.  Alden shrank</p>
<p>involuntarily from the cold water, and missed his stroke.  An eddy</p>
<p>caught the bow and shoved it out.  The whirlpool receded, dissolved.</p>
<p>The whole river rushed down upon the canoe and carried it away like</p>
<p>a leaf.</p>
<p>Who says that thought is swift and clear in a moment like that?  Who</p>
<p>talks about the whole of a man&#x27;s life passing before him in a flash</p>
<p>of light?  A flash of darkness!  Thought is paralyzed, dumb.  &quot;What</p>
<p>a fool!&quot;  &quot;Good-bye!&quot;  &quot;If--&quot;  That is about all it can say.  And if</p>
<p>the moment is prolonged, it says the same thing over again, stunned,</p>
<p>bewildered, impotent.  Then?--The rocking waves; the sinking boat;</p>
<p>the roar of the fall; the swift overturn; the icy, blinding,</p>
<p>strangling water--God!</p>
<p>Jean was flung shoreward.  Instinctively he struck out, with the</p>
<p>current and half across it, toward a point of rock.  His foot</p>
<p>touched bottom.  He drew himself up and looked back.  The canoe was</p>
<p>sweeping past, bottom upward, Alden underneath it.</p>
<p>Jean thrust himself out into the stream again, still going with the</p>
<p>current, but now away from shore.  He gripped the canoe, flinging</p>
<p>his arm over the stern.  Then he got hold of the thwart and tried to</p>
<p>turn it over.  Too heavy!  Groping underneath he caught Alden by the</p>
<p>shoulder and pulled him out.  They would have gone down together but</p>
<p>for the boat.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on tight,&quot; gasped Jean, &quot;put your arm over the canoe--the</p>
<p>other side!&quot;</p>
<p>Alden, half dazed, obeyed him.  The torrent carried the dancing,</p>
<p>slippery bark past another point.  Just below it, there was a little</p>
<p>eddy.</p>
<p>&quot;Now,&quot; cried Jean; &quot;the back-water--strike for the land!&quot;</p>
<p>They touched the black, gliddery rocks.  They staggered out of the</p>
<p>water; waist-deep, knee-deep, ankle-deep; falling and rising again.</p>
<p>They crawled up on the warm moss. . . .</p>
<p>The first thing that Alden noticed was the line of bright red spots</p>
<p>on the wing of a cedar-bird fluttering silently through the branches</p>
<p>of the tree above him.  He lay still and watched it, wondering that</p>
<p>he had never before observed those brilliant sparks of colour on the</p>
<p>little brown bird.  Then he wondered what made his legs ache so.</p>
<p>Then he saw Jean, dripping wet, sitting on a stone and looking down</p>
<p>the river.</p>
<p>He got up painfully and went over to him.  He put his hand on the</p>
<p>man&#x27;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Jean, you saved my life--I thank you, Marquis!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;M&#x27;sieu&#x27;,&quot; said Jean, springing up, &quot;I beg you not to mention it.</p>
<p>It was nothing.  A narrow shave,--but LA BONNE CHANCE!  And after</p>
<p>all, you were right,--we got to the island!  But now how to get off?&quot;</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>AN ALLIANCE OF RIVALS</p>
<p>Yes, of course they got off--the next day.  At the foot of the</p>
<p>island, two miles below, there is a place where the water runs</p>
<p>quieter, and a BATEAU can cross from the main shore.  Francois was</p>
<p>frightened when the others did not come back in the evening.  He</p>
<p>made his way around to St. Joseph d&#x27;Alma, and got a boat to come up</p>
<p>and look for their bodies.  He found them on the shore, alive and</p>
<p>very hungry.  But all that has nothing to do with the story.</p>
<p>Nor does it make any difference how Alden spent the rest of his</p>
<p>summer in the woods, what kind of fishing he had, or what moved him</p>
<p>to leave five hundred dollars with Jean when he went away.  That is</p>
<p>all padding: leave it out.  The first point of interest is what Jean</p>
<p>did with the money.  A suit of clothes, a new stove, and a set of</p>
<p>kitchen utensils for the log house opposite Grosse Ile, a trip to</p>
<p>Quebec, a little game of &quot;Blof Americain&quot; in the back room of the</p>
<p>Hotel du Nord,--that was the end of the money.</p>
<p>This is not a Sunday-school story.  Jean was no saint.  Even as a</p>
<p>hero he had his weak points.  But after his own fashion he was a</p>
<p>pretty good kind of a marquis.  He took his headache the next</p>
<p>morning as a matter of course, and his empty pocket as a trick of</p>
<p>fortune.  With the nobility, he knew very well, such things often</p>
<p>happen; but the nobility do not complain about it.  They go ahead,</p>
<p>as if it was a bagatelle.</p>
<p>Before the week was out Jean was on his way to a lumber-shanty on</p>
<p>the St. Maurice River, to cook for a crew of thirty men all winter.</p>
<p>The cook&#x27;s position in camp is curious,--half menial, half superior.</p>
<p>It is no place for a feeble man.  But a cook who is strong in the</p>
<p>back and quick with his fists can make his office much respected.</p>
<p>Wages, forty dollars a month; duties, to keep the pea-soup kettle</p>
<p>always hot and the bread-pan always full, to stand the jokes of the</p>
<p>camp up to a certain point, and after that to whip two or three of</p>
<p>the most active humourists.</p>
<p>Jean performed all his duties to perfect satisfaction.  Naturally</p>
<p>most of the jokes turned upon his great expectations.  With two of</p>
<p>the principal jokers he had exchanged the usual and conclusive form</p>
<p>of repartee,--flattened them out literally.  The ordinary BADINAGE</p>
<p>he did not mind in the least; it rather pleased him.</p>
<p>But about the first of January a new hand came into the camp,--a</p>
<p>big, black-haired fellow from Three Rivers, Pierre Lamotte DIT</p>
<p>Theophile.  With him it was different.  There seemed to be something</p>
<p>serious in his jests about &quot;the marquis.&quot;  It was not fun; it was</p>
<p>mockery; always on the edge of anger.  He acted as if he would be</p>
<p>glad to make Jean ridiculous in any way.</p>
<p>Finally the matter came to a head.  Something happened to the soup</p>
<p>one Sunday morning--tobacco probably.  Certainly it was very bad,</p>
<p>only fit to throw away; and the whole camp was mad.  It was not</p>
<p>really Pierre who played the trick; but it was he who sneered that</p>
<p>the camp would be better off if the cook knew less about castles and</p>
<p>more about cooking.  Jean answered that what the camp needed was to</p>
<p>get rid of a badreux who thought it was a joke to poison the soup.</p>
<p>Pierre took this as a personal allusion and requested him to discuss</p>
<p>the question outside.  But before the discussion began he made some</p>
<p>general remarks about the character and pretensions of Jean.</p>
<p>&quot;A marquis!&quot; said he.  &quot;This bagoulard gives himself out for a</p>
<p>marquis!  He is nothing of the kind,--a rank humbug.  There is a</p>
<p>title in the family, an estate in France, it is true.  But it is</p>
<p>mine.  I have seen the papers.  I have paid money to the lawyer.  I</p>
<p>am waiting now for him to arrange the matter.  This man knows</p>
<p>nothing about it.  He is a fraud.  I will fight him now and settle</p>
<p>the matter.&quot;</p>
<p>If a bucket of ice-water had been thrown over Jean he could not have</p>
<p>cooled off more suddenly.  He was dazed.  Another marquis?  This was</p>
<p>a complication he had never dreamed of.  It overwhelmed him like an</p>
<p>avalanche.  He must have time to dig himself out of this difficulty.</p>
<p>&quot;But stop,&quot; he cried; &quot;you go too fast.  This is more serious than a</p>
<p>pot of soup.  I must hear about this.  Let us talk first, Pierre,</p>
<p>and afterwards--&quot;</p>
<p>The camp was delighted.  It was a fine comedy,--two fools instead of</p>
<p>one.  The men pricked up their ears and clamoured for a full</p>
<p>explanation, a debate in open court.</p>
<p>But that was not Jean&#x27;s way.  He had made no secret of his</p>
<p>expectations, but he did not care to confide all the details of his</p>
<p>family history to a crowd of fellows who would probably not</p>
<p>understand and would certainly laugh.  Pierre was wrong of course,</p>
<p>but at least he was in earnest.  That was something.</p>
<p>&quot;This affair is between Pierre and me,&quot; said Jean.  &quot;We shall speak</p>
<p>of it by ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>In the snow-muffled forest, that afternoon, where the great tree-</p>
<p>trunks rose like pillars of black granite from a marble floor, and</p>
<p>the branches of spruce and fir wove a dark green roof above their</p>
<p>heads, these two stray shoots of a noble stock tried to untangle</p>
<p>their family history.  It was little that they knew about it.  They</p>
<p>could get back to their grandfathers, but beyond that the trail was</p>
<p>rather blind.  Where they crossed neither Jean nor Pierre could</p>
<p>tell.  In fact, both of their minds had been empty vessels for the</p>
<p>plausible lawyer to fill, and he had filled them with various and</p>
<p>windy stuff.  There were discrepancies and contradictions, denials</p>
<p>and disputes, flashes of anger and clouds of suspicion.</p>
<p>But through all the voluble talk, somehow or other, the two men were</p>
<p>drawing closer together.  Pierre felt Jean&#x27;s force of character, his</p>
<p>air of natural leadership, his bonhommie.  He thought, &quot;It was a</p>
<p>shame for that lawyer to trick such a fine fellow with the story</p>
<p>that he was the heir of the family.&quot;  Jean, for his part, was</p>
<p>impressed by Pierre&#x27;s simplicity and firmness of conviction.  He</p>
<p>thought, &quot;What a mean thing for that lawyer to fool such an innocent</p>
<p>as this into supposing himself the inheritor of the title.&quot;  What</p>
<p>never occurred to either of them was the idea that the lawyer had</p>
<p>deceived them both.  That was not to be dreamed of.  To admit such a</p>
<p>thought would have seemed to them like throwing away something of</p>
<p>great value which they had just found.  The family name, the papers,</p>
<p>the links of the genealogy which had been so convincingly set</p>
<p>forth,--all this had made an impression on their imagination,</p>
<p>stronger than any logical argument.  But which was the marquis?</p>
<p>That was the question.</p>
<p>&quot;Look here,&quot; said Jean at last, &quot;of what value is it that we fight?</p>
<p>We are cousins.  You think I am wrong.  I think you are wrong.  But</p>
<p>one of us must be right.  Who can tell?  There will certainly be</p>
<p>something for both of us.  Blood is stronger than currant juice.</p>
<p>Let us work together and help each other.  You come home with me</p>
<p>when this job is done.  The lawyer returns to St. Gedeon in the</p>
<p>spring.  He will know.  We can see him together.  If he has fooled</p>
<p>you, you can do what you like to him.  When--PARDON, I mean if--I</p>
<p>get the title, I will do the fair thing by you.  You shall do the</p>
<p>same by me.  Is it a bargain?&quot;</p>
<p>On this basis the compact was made.  The camp was much amazed, not</p>
<p>to say disgusted, because there was no fight.  Well-meaning efforts</p>
<p>were made at intervals through the winter to bring on a crisis.  But</p>
<p>nothing came of it.  The rival claimants had pooled their stock.</p>
<p>They acknowledged the tie of blood, and ignored the clash of</p>
<p>interests.  Together they faced the fire of jokes and stood off the</p>
<p>crowd; Pierre frowning and belligerent, Jean smiling and scornful.</p>
<p>Practically, they bossed the camp.  They were the only men who</p>
<p>always shaved on Sunday morning.  This was regarded as foppish.</p>
<p>The popular disappointment deepened into a general sense of injury.</p>
<p>In March, when the cut of timber was finished and the logs were all</p>
<p>hauled to the edge of the river, to lie there until the ice should</p>
<p>break and the &quot;drive&quot; begin, the time arrived for the camp to close.</p>
<p>The last night, under the inspiration drawn from sundry bottles</p>
<p>which had been smuggled in to celebrate the occasion, a plan was</p>
<p>concocted in the stables to humble &quot;the nobility&quot; with a grand</p>
<p>display of humour.  Jean was to be crowned as marquis with a bridle</p>
<p>and blinders:</p>
<p>Pierre was to be anointed as count, with a dipperful of harness-oil;</p>
<p>after that the fun would be impromptu.</p>
<p>The impromptu part of the programme began earlier than it was</p>
<p>advertised.  Some whisper of the plan had leaked through the chinks</p>
<p>of the wall between the shanty and the stable.  When the crowd came</p>
<p>shambling into the cabin, snickering and nudging one another, Jean</p>
<p>and Pierre were standing by the stove at the upper end of the long</p>
<p>table.</p>
<p>&quot;Down with the canaille!&quot; shouted Jean.</p>
<p>&quot;Clean out the gang!&quot; responded Pierre.</p>
<p>Brandishing long-handled frying-pans, they charged down the sides of</p>
<p>the table.  The mob wavered, turned, and were lost!  Helter-skelter</p>
<p>they fled, tumbling over one another in their haste to escape.  The</p>
<p>lamp was smashed.  The benches were upset.  In the smoky hall a</p>
<p>furious din arose,--as if Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale were once</p>
<p>more hewing their way through the castle of Carteloise.  Fear fell</p>
<p>upon the multitude, and they cried aloud grievously in their dismay.</p>
<p>The blows of the weapons echoed mightily in the darkness, and the</p>
<p>two knights laid about them grimly and with great joy.  The door was</p>
<p>too narrow for the flight.  Some of the men crept under the lowest</p>
<p>berths; others hid beneath the table.  Two, endeavouring to escape</p>
<p>by the windows, stuck fast, exposing a broad and undefended mark to</p>
<p>the pursuers.  Here the last strokes of the conflict were delivered.</p>
<p>&quot;One for the marquis!&quot; cried Jean, bringing down his weapon with a</p>
<p>sounding whack.</p>
<p>&quot;Two for the count!&quot; cried Pierre, making his pan crack like the</p>
<p>blow of a beaver&#x27;s tail when he dives.</p>
<p>Then they went out into the snowy night, and sat down together on</p>
<p>the sill of the stable-door, and laughed until the tears ran down</p>
<p>their cheeks.</p>
<p>&quot;My faith!&quot; said Jean.  &quot;That was like the ancient time.  It is from</p>
<p>the good wood that strong paddles are made,--eh, cousin?&quot;  And after</p>
<p>that there was a friendship between the two men that could not have</p>
<p>been cut with the sharpest axe in Quebec.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>A HAPPY ENDING WHICH IS ALSO A BEGINNING</p>
<p>The plan of going back to St. Gedeon, to wait for the return of the</p>
<p>lawyer, was not carried out.  Several of the little gods that use</p>
<p>their own indiscretion in arranging the pieces on the puzzle-map of</p>
<p>life, interfered with it.</p>
<p>The first to meddle was that highly irresponsible deity with the bow</p>
<p>and arrows, who has no respect for rank or age, but reserves all his</p>
<p>attention for sex.</p>
<p>When the camp on the St. Maurice dissolved, Jean went down with</p>
<p>Pierre to Three Rivers for a short visit.  There was a snug house on</p>
<p>a high bank above the river, a couple of miles from the town.  A</p>
<p>wife and an armful of children gave assurance that the race of La</p>
<p>Motte de la Luciere should not die out on this side of the ocean.</p>
<p>There was also a little sister-in-law, Alma Grenou.  If you had seen</p>
<p>her you would not have wondered at what happened.  Eyes like a deer,</p>
<p>face like a mayflower, voice like the &quot;D&quot; string in a &#x27;cello,--she</p>
<p>was the picture of Drummond&#x27;s girl in &quot;The Habitant&quot;:</p>

<p>With her Jean plunged into love.  It was not a gradual approach,</p>
<p>like gliding down a smooth stream.  It was not a swift descent, like</p>
<p>running a lively rapid.  It was a veritable plunge, like going over</p>
<p>a chute.  He did not know precisely what had happened to him at</p>
<p>first; but he knew very soon what to do about it.</p>
<p>The return to Lake St. John was postponed till a more convenient</p>
<p>season: after the snow had melted and the ice had broken up--</p>
<p>probably the lawyer would not make his visit before that.  If he</p>
<p>arrived sooner, he would come back again; he wanted his money, that</p>
<p>was certain.  Besides, what was more likely than that he should come</p>
<p>also to see Pierre?  He had promised to do so.  At all events, they</p>
<p>would wait at Three Rivers for a while.</p>
<p>The first week Jean told Alma that she was the prettiest girl he had</p>
<p>ever seen.  She tossed her head and expressed a conviction that he</p>
<p>was joking.  She suggested that he was in the habit of saying the</p>
<p>same thing to every girl.</p>
<p>The second week he made a long stride in his wooing.  He took her</p>
<p>out sleighing on the last remnant of the snow,--very thin and</p>
<p>bumpy,--and utilized the occasion to put his arm around her waist.</p>
<p>She cried &quot;Laisse-moi tranquille, Jean!&quot; boxed his ears, and said</p>
<p>she thought he must be out of his mind.</p>
<p>The following Saturday afternoon he craftily came behind her in the</p>
<p>stable as she was milking the cow, and bent her head back and kissed</p>
<p>her on the face.  She began to cry, and said he had taken an unfair</p>
<p>advantage, while her hands were busy.  She hated him.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said he, still holding her warm shoulders, &quot;if you</p>
<p>hate me, I am going home tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>The sobs calmed down quickly.  She bent herself forward so that he</p>
<p>could see the rosy nape of her neck with the curling tendrils of</p>
<p>brown hair around it.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; she said, &quot;but, Jean,--do you love me for sure?&quot;</p>
<p>After that the path was level, easy, and very quickly travelled.  On</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon the priest was notified that his services would be</p>
<p>needed for a wedding, the first week in May.  Pierre&#x27;s consent was</p>
<p>genial and hilarious.  The marriage suited him exactly.  It was a</p>
<p>family alliance.  It made everything move smooth and certain.  The</p>
<p>property would be kept together.</p>
<p>But the other little interfering gods had not yet been heard from.</p>
<p>One of them, who had special charge of what remained of the soul of</p>
<p>the dealer in unclaimed estates, put it into his head to go to Three</p>
<p>Rivers first, instead of to St. Gedeon.</p>
<p>He had a good many clients in different parts of the country,--</p>
<p>temporary clients, of course,--and it occurred to him that he might</p>
<p>as well extract another fifty dollars from Pierre Lamotte DIT</p>
<p>Theophile, before going on a longer journey.  On his way down from</p>
<p>Montreal he stopped in several small towns and slept in beds of</p>
<p>various quality.</p>
<p>Another of the little deities (the one that presides over unclean</p>
<p>villages; decidedly a false god, but sufficiently powerful) arranged</p>
<p>a surprise for the travelling lawyer.  It came out at Three Rivers.</p>
<p>He arrived about nightfall, and slept at the hotel, feeling</p>
<p>curiously depressed.  The next morning he was worse; but he was a</p>
<p>resolute and industrious dog, after his own fashion.  So he hired a</p>
<p>buggy and drove out through the mud to Pierre&#x27;s place.  They heard</p>
<p>the wagon stop at the gate, and went out to see who it was.</p>
<p>The man was hardly recognizable: face pale, lips blue, eyes dull,</p>
<p>teeth chattering.</p>
<p>&quot;Get me out of this,&quot; he muttered.  &quot;I am dying.  God&#x27;s sake, be</p>
<p>quick!&quot;</p>
<p>They helped him to the house, and he immediately went into a</p>
<p>convulsion.  From this he passed into a raging fever.  Pierre took</p>
<p>the buggy and drove posthaste to town for a doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor&#x27;s opinion was evidently serious, but his remarks were</p>
<p>non-committal.</p>
<p>&quot;Keep him in this room.  Give him ten drops of this in water every</p>
<p>hour.  One of these powders if he becomes violent.  One of you must</p>
<p>stay with him all the time.  Only one, you understand.  The rest</p>
<p>keep away.  I will come back in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>In the morning the doctor&#x27;s face was yet more grave.  He examined</p>
<p>the patient carefully.  Then he turned to Jean, who had acted as</p>
<p>nurse.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought so,&quot; said he; &quot;you must all be vaccinated immediately.</p>
<p>There is still time, I hope.  But what to do with this gentleman,</p>
<p>God knows.  We can&#x27;t send him back to the town.  He has the small-</p>
<p>pox.&quot;</p>
<p>That was a pretty prelude to a wedding festival.  They were all at</p>
<p>their wit&#x27;s end.  While the doctor scratched their arms, they</p>
<p>discussed the situation, excitedly and with desperation.  Jean was</p>
<p>the first to stop chattering and begin to think.</p>
<p>&quot;There is that old cabane of Poulin&#x27;s up the road.  It is empty</p>
<p>these three years.  But there is a good spring of water.  One could</p>
<p>patch the roof at one end and put up a stove.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good!&quot; said the doctor.  &quot;But some one to take care of him?  It</p>
<p>will be a long job, and a bad one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am going to do that,&quot; said Jean; &quot;it is my place.  This gentleman</p>
<p>cannot be left to die in the road.  Le bon Dieu did not send him</p>
<p>here for that.  The head of the family&quot;--here he stopped a moment</p>
<p>and looked at Pierre, who was silent--&quot;must take the heavy end of</p>
<p>the job, and I am ready for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good!&quot; said the doctor again.  But Alma was crying in the corner of</p>
<p>the room.</p>
<p>Four weeks, five weeks, six weeks the vigil in the cabane lasted.</p>
<p>The last patches of snow disappeared from the fields one night, as</p>
<p>if winter had picked up its rags and vanished.  The willows along</p>
<p>the brook turned yellow; the grass greened around the spring.</p>
<p>Scarlet buds flamed on the swamp maples.  A tender mist of foliage</p>
<p>spread over the woodlands.  The chokecherries burst into a glory of</p>
<p>white blossoms.  The bluebirds came back, fluting love-songs; and</p>
<p>the robins, carolling ballads of joy; and the blackbirds, creaking</p>
<p>merrily.</p>
<p>The priest came once and saw the sick man, but everything was going</p>
<p>well.  It was not necessary to run any extra risks.  Every week</p>
<p>after that he came and leaned on the fence, talking with Jean in the</p>
<p>doorway.  When he went away he always lifted three fingers--so--you</p>
<p>know the sign?  It is a very pleasant one, and it did Jean&#x27;s heart</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>Pierre kept the cabane well supplied with provisions, leaving them</p>
<p>just inside of the gate.  But with the milk it was necessary to be a</p>
<p>little careful; so the can was kept in a place by itself, under the</p>
<p>out-of-door oven, in the shade.  And beside this can Jean would</p>
<p>find, every day, something particular,--a blossom of the red</p>
<p>geranium that bloomed in the farmhouse window, a piece of cake with</p>
<p>plums in it, a bunch of trailing arbutus,--once it was a little bit</p>
<p>of blue ribbon, tied in a certain square knot--so--perhaps you know</p>
<p>that sign too?  That did Jean&#x27;s heart good also.</p>
<p>But what kind of conversation was there in the cabane when the sick</p>
<p>man&#x27;s delirium had passed and he knew what had happened to him?  Not</p>
<p>much at first, for the man was too weak.  After he began to get</p>
<p>stronger, he was thinking a great deal, fighting with himself.  In</p>
<p>the end he came out pretty well--for a lawyer of his kind.  Perhaps</p>
<p>he was desirous to leave the man whom he had deceived, and who had</p>
<p>nursed him back from death, some fragment, as much as possible, of</p>
<p>the dream that brightened his life.  Perhaps he was only anxious to</p>
<p>save as much as he could of his own reputation.  At all events, this</p>
<p>is what he did.</p>
<p>He told Jean a long story, part truth, part lie, about his</p>
<p>investigations.  The estate and the title were in the family; that</p>
<p>was certain.  Jean was the probable heir, if there was any heir;</p>
<p>that was almost sure.  The part about Pierre had been a--well, a</p>
<p>mistake.  But the trouble with the whole affair was this.  A law</p>
<p>made in the days of Napoleon limited the time for which an estate</p>
<p>could remain unclaimed.  A certain number of years, and then the</p>
<p>government took everything.  That number of years had just passed.</p>
<p>By the old law Jean was probably a marquis with a castle.  By the</p>
<p>new law?--Frankly, he could not advise a client to incur any more</p>
<p>expense.  In fact, he intended to return the amount already paid.  A</p>
<p>hundred and ten dollars, was it not?  Yes, and fifty dollars for the</p>
<p>six weeks of nursing.  VOILA, a draft on Montreal, a hundred and</p>
<p>sixty dollars,--as good as gold!  And beside that, there was the</p>
<p>incalculable debt for this great kindness to a sick man, for which</p>
<p>he would always be M. de la Motte&#x27;s grateful debtor!</p>
<p>The lawyer&#x27;s pock-marked face--the scars still red and angry--lit up</p>
<p>with a curious mixed light of shrewdness and gratitude.  Jean was</p>
<p>somewhat moved.  His castle was in ruins.  But he remained noble--by</p>
<p>the old law; that was something!</p>
<p>A few days later the doctor pronounced it safe to move the patient.</p>
<p>He came with a carriage to fetch him.  Jean, well fumigated and</p>
<p>dressed in a new suit of clothes, walked down the road beside them</p>
<p>to the farm-house gate.  There Alma met him with both hands.  His</p>
<p>eyes embraced her.  The air of June was radiant about them.  The</p>
<p>fragrance of the woods breathed itself over the broad valley.  A</p>
<p>song sparrow poured his heart out from a blossoming lilac.  The</p>
<p>world was large, and free, and very good.  And between the lovers</p>
<p>there was nothing but a little gate.</p>
<p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said the doctor, smiling, as he tightened up the</p>
<p>reins, &quot;I understand that there is a title in your family, M. de la</p>
<p>Motte, in effect that you are a marquis?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is true,&quot; said Jean, turning his head, &quot;at least so I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So do I,&quot; said the doctor &quot;But you had better go in, MONSIEUR LE</p>
<p>MARQUIS--you keep MADAME LA MARQUISE waiting.&quot;</p>
<p>THE KEEPER OF THE LIGHT</p>
<p>At long distance, looking over the blue waters of the Gulf of St.</p>
<p>Lawrence in clear weather, you might think that you saw a lonely</p>
<p>sea-gull, snow-white, perching motionless on a cobble of gray rock.</p>
<p>Then, as your boat drifted in, following the languid tide and the</p>
<p>soft southern breeze, you would perceive that the cobble of rock was</p>
<p>a rugged hill with a few bushes and stunted trees growing in the</p>
<p>crevices, and that the gleaming speck near the summit must be some</p>
<p>kind of a building--if you were on the coast of Italy or Spain you</p>
<p>would say a villa or a farm-house.  Then, as you floated still</p>
<p>farther north and drew nearer to the coast, the desolate hill would</p>
<p>detach itself from the mainland and become a little mountain-isle,</p>
<p>with a flock of smaller islets clustering around it as a brood of</p>
<p>wild ducks keep close to their mother, and with deep water, nearly</p>
<p>two miles wide, flowing between it and the shore; while the shining</p>
<p>speck on the seaward side stood out clearly as a low, whitewashed</p>
<p>dwelling with a sturdy round tower at one end, crowned with a big</p>
<p>eight-sided lantern--a solitary lighthouse.</p>
<p>That is the Isle of the Wise Virgin.  Behind it the long blue</p>
<p>Laurentian Mountains, clothed with unbroken forest, rise in sombre</p>
<p>ranges toward the Height of Land.  In front of it the waters of the</p>
<p>gulf heave and sparkle far away to where the dim peaks of St. Anne</p>
<p>des Monts are traced along the southern horizon.  Sheltered a</p>
<p>little, but not completely, by the island breakwater of granite,</p>
<p>lies the rocky beach of Dead Men&#x27;s Point, where an English navy was</p>
<p>wrecked in a night of storm a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>There are a score of wooden houses, a tiny, weather-beaten chapel, a</p>
<p>Hudson Bay Company&#x27;s store, a row of platforms for drying fish, and</p>
<p>a varied assortment of boats and nets, strung along the beach now.</p>
<p>Dead Men&#x27;s Point has developed into a centre of industry, with a</p>
<p>life, a tradition, a social character of its own.  And in one of</p>
<p>those houses, as you sit at the door in the lingering June twilight,</p>
<p>looking out across the deep channel to where the lantern of the</p>
<p>tower is just beginning to glow with orange radiance above the</p>
<p>shadow of the island--in that far-away place, in that mystical hour,</p>
<p>you should hear the story of the light and its keeper.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>When the lighthouse was built, many years ago, the island had</p>
<p>another name.  It was called the Isle of Birds.  Thousands of sea-</p>
<p>fowl nested there.  The handful of people who lived on the shore</p>
<p>robbed the nests and slaughtered the birds, with considerable</p>
<p>profit.  It was perceived in advance that the building of the</p>
<p>lighthouse would interfere with this, and with other things.  Hence</p>
<p>it was not altogether a popular improvement.  Marcel Thibault, the</p>
<p>oldest inhabitant, was the leader of the opposition.</p>
<p>&quot;That lighthouse!&quot; said he, &quot;what good will it be for us?  We know</p>
<p>the way in and out when it makes clear weather, by day or by night.</p>
<p>But when the sky gets swampy, when it makes fog, then we stay with</p>
<p>ourselves at home, or we run into La Trinite, or Pentecote.  We know</p>
<p>the way.  What?  The stranger boats?  B&#x27;EN! the stranger boats need</p>
<p>not to come here, if they know not the way.  The more fish, the more</p>
<p>seals, the more everything will there be left for us.  Just because</p>
<p>of the stranger boats, to build something that makes all the birds</p>
<p>wild and spoils the hunting--that is a fool&#x27;s work.  The good God</p>
<p>made no stupid light on the Isle of Birds.  He saw no necessity of</p>
<p>it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Besides,&quot; continued Thibault, puffing slowly at his pipe, &quot;besides--</p>
<p>those stranger boats, sometimes they are lost, they come ashore.</p>
<p>It is sad!  But who gets the things that are saved, all sorts of</p>
<p>things, good to put into our houses, good to eat, good to sell,</p>
<p>sometimes a boat that can be patched up almost like new--who gets</p>
<p>these things, eh?  Doubtless those for whom the good God intended</p>
<p>them.  But who shall get them when this sacre lighthouse is built,</p>
<p>eh?  Tell me that, you Baptiste Fortin.&quot;</p>
<p>Fortin represented the party of progress in the little parliament of</p>
<p>the beach.  He had come down from Quebec some years ago bringing</p>
<p>with him a wife and two little daughters, and a good many new</p>
<p>notions about life.  He had good luck at the cod-fishing, and built</p>
<p>a house with windows at the side as well as in front.  When his</p>
<p>third girl, Nataline, was born, he went so far as to paint the house</p>
<p>red, and put on a kitchen, and enclose a bit of ground for a yard.</p>
<p>This marked him as a radical, an innovator.  It was expected that he</p>
<p>would defend the building of the lighthouse.  And he did.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Thibault,&quot; he said, &quot;you talk well, but you talk too late.</p>
<p>It is of a past age, your talk.  A new time comes to the Cote Nord.</p>
<p>We begin to civilize ourselves.  To hold back against the light</p>
<p>would be our shame.  Tell me this, Marcel Thibault, what men are</p>
<p>they that love darkness?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;TORRIEUX!&quot; growled Thibault, &quot;that is a little strong.  You say my</p>
<p>deeds are evil?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; answered Fortin; &quot;I say not that, my friend, but I say</p>
<p>this lighthouse means good: good for us, and good for all who come</p>
<p>to this coast.  It will bring more trade to us.  It will bring a</p>
<p>boat with the mail, with newspapers, perhaps once, perhaps twice a</p>
<p>month, all through the summer.  It will bring us into the great</p>
<p>world.  To lose that for the sake of a few birds--CA SERA B&#x27;EN DE</p>
<p>VALEUR!  Besides, it is impossible.  The lighthouse is coming,</p>
<p>certain.&quot;</p>
<p>Fortin was right, of course.  But Thibault&#x27;s position was not</p>
<p>altogether unnatural, nor unfamiliar.  All over the world, for the</p>
<p>past hundred years, people have been kicking against the sharpness</p>
<p>of the pricks that drove them forward out of the old life, the wild</p>
<p>life, the free life, grown dear to them because it was so easy.</p>
<p>There has been a terrible interference with bird-nesting and other</p>
<p>things.  All over the world the great Something that bridges rivers,</p>
<p>and tunnels mountains, and fells forests, and populates deserts, and</p>
<p>opens up the hidden corners of the earth, has been pushing steadily</p>
<p>on; and the people who like things to remain as they are have had to</p>
<p>give up a great deal.  There was no exception made in favour of Dead</p>
<p>Men&#x27;s Point.  The Isle of Birds lay in the line of progress.  The</p>
<p>lighthouse arrived.</p>
<p>It was a very good house for that day.  The keeper&#x27;s dwelling had</p>
<p>three rooms and was solidly built.  The tower was thirty feet high.</p>
<p>The lantern held a revolving light, with a four-wick Fresnel lamp,</p>
<p>burning sperm oil.  There was one of Stevenson&#x27;s new cages of</p>
<p>dioptric prisms around the flame, and once every minute it was</p>
<p>turned by clockwork, flashing a broad belt of radiance fifteen miles</p>
<p>across the sea.  All night long that big bright eye was opening and</p>
<p>shutting.  &quot;BAGUETTE!&quot; said Thibault, &quot;it winks like a one-eyed</p>
<p>Windigo.&quot;</p>
<p>The Department of Marine and Fisheries sent down an expert from</p>
<p>Quebec to keep the light in order and run it for the first summer.</p>
<p>He took Fortin as his assistant.  By the end of August he reported</p>
<p>to headquarters that the light was all right, and that Fortin was</p>
<p>qualified to be appointed keeper.  Before October was out the</p>
<p>certificate of appointment came back, and the expert packed his bag</p>
<p>to go up the river.</p>
<p>&quot;Now look here, Fortin,&quot; said he, &quot;this is no fishing trip.  Do you</p>
<p>think you are up to this job?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Fortin.</p>
<p>&quot;Well now, do you remember all this business about the machinery</p>
<p>that turns the lenses?  That &#x27;s the main thing.  The bearings must</p>
<p>be kept well oiled, and the weight must never get out of order.  The</p>
<p>clock-face will tell you when it is running right.  If anything gets</p>
<p>hitched up here&#x27;s the crank to keep it going until you can</p>
<p>straighten the machine again.  It&#x27;s easy enough to turn it.  But you</p>
<p>must never let it stop between dark and daylight.  The regular turn</p>
<p>once a minute--that&#x27;s the mark of this light.  If it shines steady</p>
<p>it might as well be out.  Yes, better!  Any vessel coming along here</p>
<p>in a dirty night and seeing a fixed light would take it for the Cap</p>
<p>Loup-Marin and run ashore.  This particular light has got to revolve</p>
<p>once a minute every night from April first to December tenth,</p>
<p>certain.  Can you do it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certain,&quot; said Fortin.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the way I like to hear a man talk!  Now, you&#x27;ve got oil</p>
<p>enough to last you through till the tenth of December, when you</p>
<p>close the light, and to run on for a month in the spring after you</p>
<p>open again.  The ice may be late in going out and perhaps the</p>
<p>supply-boat can&#x27;t get down before the middle of April, or</p>
<p>thereabouts.  But she&#x27;ll bring plenty of oil when she comes, so</p>
<p>you&#x27;ll be all right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Fortin.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&#x27;ve said it all, I guess.  You understand what you&#x27;ve got to</p>
<p>do?  Good-by and good luck.  You&#x27;re the keeper of the light now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good luck,&quot; said Fortin, &quot;I am going to keep it.&quot;  The same day he</p>
<p>shut up the red house on the beach and moved to the white house on</p>
<p>the island with Marie-Anne, his wife, and the three girls, Alma,</p>
<p>aged seventeen, Azilda, aged fifteen, and Nataline, aged thirteen.</p>
<p>He was the captain, and Marie-Anne was the mate, and the three girls</p>
<p>were the crew.  They were all as full of happy pride as if they had</p>
<p>come into possession of a great fortune.</p>
<p>It was the thirty-first day of October.  A snow-shower had silvered</p>
<p>the island.  The afternoon was clear and beautiful.  As the sun</p>
<p>sloped toward the rose-coloured hills of the mainland the whole</p>
<p>family stood out in front of the lighthouse looking up at the tower.</p>
<p>&quot;Regard him well, my children,&quot; said Baptiste; &quot;God has given him to</p>
<p>us to keep, and to keep us.  Thibault says he is a Windigo.  B&#x27;EN!</p>
<p>We shall see that he is a friendly Windigo.  Every minute all the</p>
<p>night he shall wink, just for kindness and good luck to all the</p>
<p>world, till the daylight.&quot;</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>On the ninth of November, at three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon,</p>
<p>Baptiste went into the tower to see that the clockwork was in order</p>
<p>for the night.  He set the dial on the machine, put a few drops of</p>
<p>oil on the bearings of the cylinder, and started to wind up the</p>
<p>weight.</p>
<p>It rose a few inches, gave a dull click, and then stopped dead.  He</p>
<p>tugged a little harder, but it would not move.  Then he tried to let</p>
<p>it down.  He pushed at the lever that set the clockwork in motion.</p>
<p>He might as well have tried to make the island turn around by</p>
<p>pushing at one of the little spruce trees that clung to the rock.</p>
<p>Then it dawned fearfully upon him that something must be wrong.</p>
<p>Trembling with anxiety, he climbed up and peered in among the</p>
<p>wheels.</p>
<p>The escapement wheel was cracked clean through, as if some one had</p>
<p>struck it with the head of an axe, and one of the pallets of the</p>
<p>spindle was stuck fast in the crack.  He could knock it out easily</p>
<p>enough, but when the crack came around again, the pallet would catch</p>
<p>and the clock would stop once more.  It was a fatal injury.</p>
<p>Baptiste turned white, then red, gripped his head in his hands, and</p>
<p>ran down the steps, out of the door, straight toward his canoe,</p>
<p>which was pulled up on the western side of the island.</p>
<p>&quot;DAME!&quot; he cried, &quot;who has done this?  Let me catch him!  If that</p>
<p>old Thibault--&quot;</p>
<p>As he leaped down the rocky slope the setting sun gleamed straight</p>
<p>in his eyes.  It was poised like a ball of fire on the very edge of</p>
<p>the mountains.  Five minutes more and it would be gone.  Fifteen</p>
<p>minutes more and darkness would close in.  Then the giant&#x27;s eye must</p>
<p>begin to glow, and to wink precisely once a minute all night long.</p>
<p>If not, what became of the keeper&#x27;s word, his faith, his honour?</p>
<p>No matter how the injury to the clockwork was done.  No matter who</p>
<p>was to be blamed or punished for it.  That could wait.  The question</p>
<p>now was whether the light would fail or not.  And it must be</p>
<p>answered within a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>That red ray of the vanishing sun was like a blow in the face to</p>
<p>Baptiste.  It stopped him short, dazed and bewildered.  Then he came</p>
<p>to himself, wheeled, and ran up the rocks faster than he had come</p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>&quot;Marie-Anne!  Alma!&quot; he shouted, as he dashed past the door of the</p>
<p>house, &quot;all of you!  To me, in the tower!&quot;</p>
<p>He was up in the lantern when they came running in, full of</p>
<p>curiosity, excited, asking twenty questions at once.  Nataline</p>
<p>climbed up the ladder and put her head through the trap-door.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; she panted.  &quot;What has hap--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go down,&quot; answered her father, &quot;go down all at once.  Wait for me.</p>
<p>I am coming.  I will explain.&quot;</p>
<p>The explanation was not altogether lucid and scientific.  There were</p>
<p>some bad words mixed up with it.</p>
<p>Baptiste was still hot with anger and the unsatisfied desire to whip</p>
<p>somebody, he did not know whom, for something, he did not know what.</p>
<p>But angry as he was, he was still sane enough to hold his mind hard</p>
<p>and close to the main point.  The crank must be adjusted; the</p>
<p>machine must be ready to turn before dark.  While he worked he</p>
<p>hastily made the situation clear to his listeners.</p>
<p>That crank must be turned by hand, round and round all night, not</p>
<p>too slow, not too fast.  The dial on the machine must mark time with</p>
<p>the clock on the wall.  The light must flash once every minute until</p>
<p>daybreak.  He would do as much of the labour as he could, but the</p>
<p>wife and the two older girls must help him.  Nataline could go to</p>
<p>bed.</p>
<p>At this Nataline&#x27;s short upper lip trembled.  She rubbed her eyes</p>
<p>with the sleeve of her dress, and began to weep silently.</p>
<p>&quot;What is the matter with you?&quot; said her mother, &quot;bad child, have you</p>
<p>fear to sleep alone?  A big girl like you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she sobbed, &quot;I have no fear, but I want some of the fun.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fun!&quot; growled her father.  &quot;What fun?  NOM D&#x27;UN CHIEN!  She calls</p>
<p>this fun!&quot;  He looked at her for a moment, as she stood there, half</p>
<p>defiant, half despondent, with her red mouth quivering and her big</p>
<p>brown eyes sparkling fire; then he burst into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;Come here, my little wild-cat,&quot; he said, drawing her to him and</p>
<p>kissing her; &quot;you are a good girl after all.  I suppose you think</p>
<p>this light is part yours, eh?&quot;</p>
<p>The girl nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;B&#x27;EN!  You shall have your share, fun and all.  You shall make the</p>
<p>tea for us and bring us something to eat.  Perhaps when Alma and</p>
<p>&#x27;Zilda fatigue themselves they will permit a few turns of the crank</p>
<p>to you.  Are you content?  Run now and boil the kettle.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a very long night.  No matter how easily a handle turns,</p>
<p>after a certain number of revolutions there is a stiffness about it.</p>
<p>The stiffness is not in the handle, but in the hand that pushes it.</p>
<p>Round and round, evenly, steadily, minute after minute, hour after</p>
<p>hour, shoving out, drawing in, circle after circle, no swerving, no</p>
<p>stopping, no varying the motion, turn after turn--fifty-five, fifty-</p>
<p>six, fifty-seven--what&#x27;s the use of counting?  Watch the dial; go to</p>
<p>sleep--no! for God&#x27;s sake, no sleep!  But how hard it is to keep</p>
<p>awake!  How heavy the arm grows, how stiffly the muscles move, how</p>
<p>the will creaks and groans.  BATISCAN!  It is not easy for a human</p>
<p>being to become part of a machine.</p>
<p>Fortin himself took the longest spell at the crank, of course.  He</p>
<p>went at his work with a rigid courage.  His red-hot anger had cooled</p>
<p>down into a shape that was like a bar of forged steel.  He meant to</p>
<p>make that light revolve if it killed him to do it.  He was the</p>
<p>captain of a company that had run into an ambuscade.  He was going</p>
<p>to fight his way through if he had to fight alone.</p>
<p>The wife and the two older girls followed him blindly and bravely,</p>
<p>in the habit of sheer obedience.  They did not quite understand the</p>
<p>meaning of the task, the honour of victory, the shame of defeat.</p>
<p>But Fortin said it must be done, and he knew best.  So they took</p>
<p>their places in turn, as he grew weary, and kept the light flashing.</p>
<p>And Nataline--well, there is no way of describing what Nataline did,</p>
<p>except to say that she played the fife.</p>
<p>She felt the contest just as her father did, not as deeply, perhaps,</p>
<p>but in the same spirit.  She went into the fight with darkness like</p>
<p>a little soldier.  And she played the fife.</p>
<p>When she came up from the kitchen with the smoking pail of tea, she</p>
<p>rapped on the door and called out to know whether the Windigo was at</p>
<p>home to-night.</p>
<p>She ran in and out of the place like a squirrel.  She looked up at</p>
<p>the light and laughed.  Then she ran in and reported.  &quot;He winks,&quot;</p>
<p>she said, &quot;old one-eye winks beautifully.  Keep him going.  My turn</p>
<p>now!&quot;</p>
<p>She refused to be put off with a shorter spell than the other girls.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she cried, &quot;I can do it as well as you.  You think you are so</p>
<p>much older.  Well, what of that?  The light is part mine; father</p>
<p>said so.  Let me turn.  va-t-en.&quot;</p>
<p>When the first glimmer of the little day came shivering along the</p>
<p>eastern horizon, Nataline was at the crank.  The mother and the two</p>
<p>older girls were half asleep.  Baptiste stepped out to look at the</p>
<p>sky.  &quot;Come,&quot; he cried, returning.  &quot;We can stop now, it is growing</p>
<p>gray in the east, almost morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But not yet,&quot; said Nataline; &quot;we must wait for the first red.  A</p>
<p>few more turns.  Let&#x27;s finish it up with a song.&quot;</p>
<p>She shook her head and piped up the refrain of the old Canadian</p>
<p>chanson:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#393A34;background-color:#f6f8fa"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"> &quot;En roulant ma boule-le roulant</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  En roulant ma bou-le.&quot;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Â§çÂà∂‰ª£Á†ÅÂà∞Ââ™Ë¥¥Êùø" title="Â§çÂà∂" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>And to that cheerful music the first night&#x27;s battle was carried</p>
<p>through to victory.</p>
<p>The next day Fortin spent two hours in trying to repair the</p>
<p>clockwork.  It was of no use.  The broken part was indispensable and</p>
<p>could not be replaced.</p>
<p>At noon he went over to the mainland to tell of the disaster, and</p>
<p>perhaps to find out if any hostile hand was responsible for it.  He</p>
<p>found out nothing.  Every one denied all knowledge of the accident.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was a flaw in the wheel; perhaps it had broken itself.</p>
<p>That was possible.  Fortin could not deny it; but the thing that</p>
<p>hurt him most was that he got so little sympathy.  Nobody seemed to</p>
<p>care whether the light was kept burning or not.  When he told them</p>
<p>how the machine had been turned all night by hand, they were</p>
<p>astonished.  &quot;CRE-IE!&quot; they cried, &quot;you must have had a great misery</p>
<p>to do that.&quot;  But that he proposed to go on doing it for a month</p>
<p>longer, until December tenth, and to begin again on April first, and</p>
<p>go on turning the light by hand for three or four weeks more until</p>
<p>the supply-boat came down and brought the necessary tools to repair</p>
<p>the machine--such an idea as this went beyond their horizon.</p>
<p>&quot;But you are crazy, Baptiste,&quot; they said, &quot;you can never do it; you</p>
<p>are not capable.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would be crazy,&quot; he answered, &quot;if I did not see what I must do.</p>
<p>That light is my charge.  In all the world there is nothing else so</p>
<p>great as that for me and for my family--you understand?  For us it</p>
<p>is the chief thing.  It is my Ten Commandments.  I shall keep it or</p>
<p>be damned.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a silence after this remark.  They were not very</p>
<p>particular about the use of language at Dead Men&#x27;s Point, but this</p>
<p>shocked them a little.  They thought that Fortin was swearing a</p>
<p>shade too hard.  In reality he was never more reverent, never more</p>
<p>soberly in earnest.</p>
<p>After a while he continued, &quot;I want some one to help me with the</p>
<p>work on the island.  We must be up all the nights now.  By day we</p>
<p>must get some sleep.  I want another man or a strong boy.  Is there</p>
<p>any who will come?  The Government will pay.  Or if not, I will pay,</p>
<p>moi-meme.&quot;</p>
<p>There was no response.  All the men hung back.  The lighthouse was</p>
<p>still unpopular, or at least it was on trial.  Fortin&#x27;s pluck and</p>
<p>resolution had undoubtedly impressed them a little.  But they still</p>
<p>hesitated to commit themselves to his side.</p>
<p>&quot;B&#x27;en,&quot; he said, &quot;there is no one.  Then we shall manage the affair</p>
<p>en famille.  Bon soir, messieurs!&quot;</p>
<p>He walked down to the beach with his head in the air, without</p>
<p>looking back.  But before he had his canoe in the water he heard</p>
<p>some one running down behind him.  It was Thibault&#x27;s youngest son,</p>
<p>Marcel, a well-grown boy of sixteen, very much out of breath with</p>
<p>running and shyness.</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Fortin,&quot; he stammered, &quot;will you--do you think--am I big</p>
<p>enough?&quot;</p>
<p>Baptiste looked him in the face for a moment.  Then his eyes</p>
<p>twinkled.</p>
<p>&quot;Certain,&quot; he answered, &quot;you are bigger than your father.  But what</p>
<p>will he say to this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He says,&quot; blurted out Marcel--&quot;well, he says that he will say</p>
<p>nothing if I do not ask him.&quot;</p>
<p>So the little Marcel was enlisted in the crew on the island.  For</p>
<p>thirty nights those six people--a man, and a boy, and four women</p>
<p>(Nataline was not going to submit to any distinctions on the score</p>
<p>of age, you may be sure)--for a full month they turned their</p>
<p>flashing lantern by hand from dusk to day-break.</p>
<p>The fog, the frost, the hail, the snow beleaguered their tower.</p>
<p>Hunger and cold, sleeplessness and weariness, pain and</p>
<p>discouragement, held rendezvous in that dismal, cramped little room.</p>
<p>Many a night Nataline&#x27;s fife of fun played a feeble, wheezy note.</p>
<p>But it played.  And the crank went round.  And every bit of glass in</p>
<p>the lantern was as clear as polished crystal.  And the big lamp was</p>
<p>full of oil.  And the great eye of the friendly giant winked without</p>
<p>ceasing, through fierce storm and placid moonlight.</p>
<p>When the tenth of December came, the light went to sleep for the</p>
<p>winter, and the keepers took their way across the ice to the</p>
<p>mainland.  They had won the battle, not only on the island, fighting</p>
<p>against the elements, but also at Dead Men&#x27;s Point, against public</p>
<p>opinion.  The inhabitants began to understand that the lighthouse</p>
<p>meant something--a law, an order, a principle.</p>
<p>Men cannot help feeling respect for a thing when they see others</p>
<p>willing to fight or to suffer for it.</p>
<p>When the time arrived to kindle the light again in the spring,</p>
<p>Fortin could have had any one that he wanted to help him.  But no;</p>
<p>he chose the little Marcel again; the boy wanted to go, and he had</p>
<p>earned the right.  Besides, he and Nataline had struck up a close</p>
<p>friendship on the island, cemented during the winter by various</p>
<p>hunting excursions after hares and ptarmigan.  Marcel was a skilful</p>
<p>setter of snares.  But Nataline was not content until she had won</p>
<p>consent to borrow her father&#x27;s CARABINE.  They hunted in</p>
<p>partnership.  One day they had shot a fox.  That is, Nataline had</p>
<p>shot it, though Marcel had seen it first and tracked it.  Now they</p>
<p>wanted to try for a seal on the point of the island when the ice</p>
<p>went out.  It was quite essential that Marcel should go.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides,&quot; said Baptiste to his wife, confidentially, &quot;a boy costs</p>
<p>less than a man.  Why should we waste money?  Marcel is best.&quot;</p>
<p>A peasant-hero is seldom averse to economy in small things, like</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>But there was not much play in the spring session with the light on</p>
<p>the island.  It was a bitter job.  December had been lamb-like</p>
<p>compared with April.  First, the southeast wind kept the ice driving</p>
<p>in along the shore.  Then the northwest wind came hurtling down from</p>
<p>the Arctic wilderness like a pack of wolves.  There was a snow-storm</p>
<p>of four days and nights that made the whole world--earth and sky and</p>
<p>sea--look like a crazy white chaos.  And through it all, that weary,</p>
<p>dogged crank must be kept turning--turning from dark to daylight.</p>
<p>It seemed as if the supply-boat would never come.  At last they saw</p>
<p>it, one fair afternoon, April the twenty-ninth, creeping slowly down</p>
<p>the coast.  They were just getting ready for another night&#x27;s work.</p>
<p>Fortin ran out of the tower, took off his hat, and began to say his</p>
<p>prayers.  The wife and the two elder girls stood in the kitchen</p>
<p>door, crossing themselves, with tears in their eyes.  Marcel and</p>
<p>Nataline were coming up from the point of the island, where they had</p>
<p>been watching for their seal.  She was singing</p>

<p>When she saw the boat she stopped short for a minute.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;they find us awake, n&#x27;est-c&#x27;pas?  And if they</p>
<p>don&#x27;t come faster than that we&#x27;ll have another chance to show them</p>

<p>III</p>
<p>You did not suppose that was the end of the story, did you?</p>
<p>No, an out-of-doors story does not end like that, broken off in the</p>
<p>middle, with a bit of a song.  It goes on to something definite,</p>
<p>like a wedding or a funeral.</p>
<p>You have not heard, yet, how near the light came to failing, and how</p>
<p>the keeper saved it and something else too.  Nataline&#x27;s story is not</p>
<p>told; it is only begun.  This first part is only the introduction,</p>
<p>just to let you see what kind of a girl she was, and how her life</p>
<p>was made.  If you want to hear the conclusion, we must hurry along a</p>
<p>little faster or we shall never get to it.</p>
<p>Nataline grew up like a young birch tree--stately and strong, good</p>
<p>to look at.  She was beautiful in her place; she fitted it exactly.</p>
<p>Her bronzed face with an under-tinge of red; her low, black</p>
<p>eyebrows; her clear eyes like the brown waters of a woodland stream;</p>
<p>her dark, curly hair with little tendrils always blowing loose</p>
<p>around the pillar of her neck; her broad breast and sloping</p>
<p>shoulders; her firm, fearless step; her voice, rich and vibrant; her</p>
<p>straight, steady looks--but there, who can describe a thing like</p>
<p>that?  I tell you she was a girl to love out-of-doors.</p>
<p>There was nothing that she could not do.  She could cook; she could</p>
<p>swing an axe; she could paddle a canoe; she could fish; she could</p>
<p>shoot; and, best of all, she could run the lighthouse.  Her father&#x27;s</p>
<p>devotion to it had gone into her blood.  It was the centre of her</p>
<p>life, her law of God.  There was nothing about it that she did not</p>
<p>understand and love.  From the first of April to the tenth of</p>
<p>December the flashing of that light was like the beating of her</p>
<p>heart--steady, even, unfaltering.  She kept time to it as</p>
<p>unconsciously as the tides follow the moon.  She lived by it and for</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>There were no more accidents to the clockwork after the first one</p>
<p>was repaired.  It ran on regularly, year after year.</p>
<p>Alma and Azilda were married and went away to live, one on the South</p>
<p>Shore, the other at Quebec.  Nataline was her father&#x27;s right-hand</p>
<p>man.  As the rheumatism took hold of him and lamed his shoulders and</p>
<p>wrists, more and more of the work fell upon her.  She was proud of it.</p>
<p>At last it came to pass, one day in January, that Baptiste died.  He</p>
<p>was not gathered to his fathers, for they were buried far away</p>
<p>beside the Montmorenci, and on the rocky coast of Brittany.  But the</p>
<p>men dug through the snow behind the tiny chapel at Dead Men&#x27;s Point,</p>
<p>and made a grave for Baptiste Fortin, and the young priest of the</p>
<p>mission read the funeral service over it.</p>
<p>It went without saying that Nataline was to be the keeper of the</p>
<p>light, at least until the supply-boat came down again in the spring</p>
<p>and orders arrived from the Government in Quebec.  Why not?  She was</p>
<p>a woman, it is true.  But if a woman can do a thing as well as a</p>
<p>man, why should she not do it?  Besides, Nataline could do this</p>
<p>particular thing much better than any man on the Point.  Everybody</p>
<p>approved of her as the heir of her father, especially young Marcel</p>
<p>Thibault.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yes, of course.  You could not help guessing it.  He was Nataline&#x27;s</p>
<p>lover.  They were to be married the next summer.  They sat together</p>
<p>in the best room, while the old mother was rocking to and fro and</p>
<p>knitting beside the kitchen stove, and talked of what they were</p>
<p>going to do.  Once in a while, when Nataline grieved for her father,</p>
<p>she would let Marcel put his arm around her and comfort her in the</p>
<p>way that lovers know.  But their talk was mainly of the future,</p>
<p>because they were young, and of the light, because Nataline&#x27;s life</p>
<p>belonged to it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Government would remember that year when it was kept</p>
<p>going by hand for two months, and give it to her to keep as long as</p>
<p>she lived.  That would be only fair.  Certainly, it was hers for the</p>
<p>present.  No one had as good a right to it.  She took possession</p>
<p>without a doubt.  At all events, while she was the keeper the light</p>
<p>should not fail.</p>
<p>But that winter was a bad one on the North Shore, and particularly</p>
<p>at Dead Men&#x27;s Point.  It was terribly bad.  The summer before, the</p>
<p>fishing had been almost a dead failure.  In June a wild storm had</p>
<p>smashed all the salmon nets and swept most of them away.  In July</p>
<p>they could find no caplin for bait for the cod-fishing, and in</p>
<p>August and September they could find no cod.  The few bushels of</p>
<p>potatoes that some of the inhabitants had planted, rotted in the</p>
<p>ground.  The people at the Point went into the winter short of money</p>
<p>and very short of food.</p>
<p>There were some supplies at the store, pork and flour and molasses,</p>
<p>and they could run through the year on credit and pay their debts</p>
<p>the following summer if the fish came back.  But this resource also</p>
<p>failed them.  In the last week of January the store caught fire and</p>
<p>burned up.  Nothing was saved.  The only hope now was the seal-</p>
<p>hunting in February and March and April.  That at least would bring</p>
<p>them meat and oil enough to keep them from starvation.</p>
<p>But this hope failed, too.  The winds blew strong from the north and</p>
<p>west, driving the ice far out into the gulf.  The chase was long and</p>
<p>perilous.  The seals were few and wild.  Less than a dozen were</p>
<p>killed in all.  By the last week in March Dead Men&#x27;s Point stood</p>
<p>face to face with famine.</p>
<p>Then it was that old Thibault had an idea.</p>
<p>&quot;There is sperm oil on the Island of Birds,&quot; said he, &quot;in the</p>
<p>lighthouse, plenty of it, gallons of it.  It is not very good to</p>
<p>taste, perhaps, but what of that?  It will keep life in the body.</p>
<p>The Esquimaux drink it in the north, often.  We must take the oil of</p>
<p>the lighthouse to keep us from starving until the supply-boat comes</p>
<p>down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how shall we get it?&quot; asked the others.  &quot;It is locked up.</p>
<p>Nataline Fortin has the key.  Will she give it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give it?&quot; growled Thibault.  &quot;Name of a name! of course she will</p>
<p>give it.  She must.  Is not a life, the life of all of us, more than</p>
<p>a light?&quot;</p>
<p>A self-appointed committee of three, with Thibault at the head,</p>
<p>waited upon Nataline without delay, told her their plan, and asked</p>
<p>for the key.  She thought it over silently for a few minutes, and</p>
<p>then refused point-blank.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she said, &quot;I will not give the key.  That oil is for the lamp.</p>
<p>If you take it, the lamp will not be lighted on the first of April;</p>
<p>it will not be burning when the supply-boat comes.  For me, that</p>
<p>would be shame, disgrace, worse than death.  I am the keeper of the</p>
<p>light.  You shall not have the oil.&quot;</p>
<p>They argued with her, pleaded with her, tried to browbeat her.  She</p>
<p>was a rock.  Her round under-jaw was set like a steel trap.  Her</p>
<p>lips straightened into a white line.  Her eyebrows drew together,</p>
<p>and her eyes grew black.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she cried, &quot;I tell you no, no, a thousand times no.  All in</p>
<p>this house I will share with you.  But not one drop of what belongs</p>
<p>to the light!  Never.&quot;</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon the priest came to see her; a thin, pale</p>
<p>young man, bent with the hardships of his life, and with sad dreams</p>
<p>in his sunken eyes.  He talked with her very gently and kindly.</p>
<p>&quot;Think well, my daughter; think seriously what you do.  Is it not</p>
<p>our first duty to save human life?  Surely that must be according to</p>
<p>the will of God.  Will you refuse to obey it?&quot;</p>
<p>Nataline was trembling a little now.  Her brows were unlocked.  The</p>
<p>tears stood in her eyes and ran down her cheeks.  She was twisting</p>
<p>her hands together.</p>
<p>&quot;My father,&quot; she answered, &quot;I desire to do the will of God.  But how</p>
<p>shall I know it?  Is it not His first command that we should love</p>
<p>and serve Him faithfully in the duty which He has given us?  He gave</p>
<p>me this light to keep.  My father kept it.  He is dead.  If I am</p>
<p>unfaithful what will he say to me?  Besides, the supply-boat is</p>
<p>coming soon--I have thought of this--when it comes it will bring</p>
<p>food.  But if the light is out, the boat may be lost.  That would be</p>
<p>the punishment for my sin.  No, MON PERE, we must trust God.  He</p>
<p>will keep the people.  I will keep the light.&quot;&#x27;</p>
<p>The priest looked at her long and steadily.  A glow came into his</p>
<p>face.  He put his hand on her shoulder.  &quot;You shall follow your</p>
<p>conscience,&quot; he said quietly.  &quot;Peace be with you, Nataline.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening just at dark Marcel came.  She let him take her in his</p>
<p>arms and kiss her.  She felt like a little child, tired and weak.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; he whispered, &quot;you have done bravely, sweetheart.  You were</p>
<p>right not to give the key.  That would have been a shame to you.</p>
<p>But it is all settled now.  They will have the oil without your</p>
<p>fault.  To-night they are going out to the lighthouse to break in</p>
<p>and take what they want.  You need not know.  There will be no</p>
<p>blame--&quot;</p>
<p>She straightened in his arms as if an electric shock had passed</p>
<p>through her.  She sprang back, blazing with anger.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; she cried, &quot;me a thief by round-about,--with my hand behind</p>
<p>my back and my eyes shut?  Never.  Do you think I care only for the</p>
<p>blame?  I tell you that is nothing.  My light shall not be robbed,</p>
<p>never, never!&quot;</p>
<p>She came close to him and took him by the shoulders.  Their eyes</p>
<p>were on a level.  He was a strong man, but she was the stronger</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>&quot;Marcel Thibault,&quot; she said, &quot;do you love me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My faith,&quot; he gasped, &quot;I do.  You know I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then listen,&quot; she continued; &quot;this is what you are going to do.</p>
<p>You are going down to the shore at once to make ready the big canoe.</p>
<p>I am going to get food enough to last us for the month.  It will be</p>
<p>a hard pinch, but it will do.  Then we are going out to the island</p>
<p>to-night, in less than an hour.  Day after to-morrow is the first of</p>
<p>April.  Then we shall light the lantern, and it shall burn every</p>
<p>night until the boat comes down.  You hear?  Now go: and be quick</p>
<p>and bring your gun.&quot;</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>They pushed off in the black darkness, among the fragments of ice</p>
<p>that lay along the shore.  They crossed the strait in silence, and</p>
<p>hid their canoe among the rocks on the island.  They carried their</p>
<p>stuff up to the house and locked it in the kitchen.  Then they</p>
<p>unlocked the tower, and went in, Marcel with his shot-gun, and</p>
<p>Nataline with her father&#x27;s old carabine.  They fastened the door</p>
<p>again, and bolted it, and sat down in the dark to wait.</p>
<p>Presently they heard the grating of the prow of the barge on the</p>
<p>stones below, the steps of men stumbling up the steep path, and</p>
<p>voices mingled in confused talk.  The glimmer of a couple of</p>
<p>lanterns went bobbing in and out among the rocks and bushes.  There</p>
<p>was a little crowd of eight or ten men, and they came on carelessly,</p>
<p>chattering and laughing.  Three of them carried axes, and three</p>
<p>others a heavy log of wood which they had picked up on their way.</p>
<p>&quot;The log is better than the axes,&quot; said one; &quot;take it in your hands</p>
<p>this way, two of you on one side, another on the opposite side in</p>
<p>the middle.  Then swing it back and forwards and let it go.  The</p>
<p>door will come down, I tell you, like a sheet of paper.  But wait</p>
<p>till I give the word, then swing hard.  One--two--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; cried Nataline, throwing open the little window.  &quot;If you</p>
<p>dare to touch that door, I shoot.&quot;</p>
<p>She thrust out the barrel of the rifle, and Marcel&#x27;s shot-gun</p>
<p>appeared beside it.  The old rifle was not loaded, but who knew</p>
<p>that?  Besides, both barrels of the shot-gun were full.</p>
<p>There was amazement in the crowd outside the tower, and</p>
<p>consternation, and then anger.</p>
<p>&quot;Marcel,&quot; they shouted, &quot;you there?  MAUDIT POLISSON!  Come out of</p>
<p>that.  Let us in.  You told us--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; answered Marcel, &quot;but I was mistaken, that is all.  I</p>
<p>stand by Mademoiselle Fortin.  What she says is right.  If any man</p>
<p>tries to break in here, we kill him.  No more talk!&quot;</p>
<p>The gang muttered; cursed; threatened; looked at the guns; and went</p>
<p>off to their boat.</p>
<p>&quot;It is murder that you will do,&quot; one of them called out, &quot;you are a</p>
<p>murderess, you Mademoiselle Fortin! you cause the people to die of</p>
<p>hunger!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not I,&quot; she answered; &quot;that is as the good God pleases.  No matter.</p>
<p>The light shall burn.&quot;</p>
<p>They heard the babble of the men as they stumbled down the hill; the</p>
<p>grinding of the boat on the rocks as they shoved off; the rattle of</p>
<p>the oars in the rowlocks.  After that the island was as still as a</p>
<p>graveyard.</p>
<p>Then Nataline sat down on the floor in the dark, and put her face in</p>
<p>her hands, and cried.  Marcel tried to comfort her.  She took his</p>
<p>hand and pushed it gently away from her waist.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Marcel,&quot; she said, &quot;not now!  Not that, please, Marcel!  Come</p>
<p>into the house.  I want to talk with you.&quot;</p>
<p>They went into the cold, dark kitchen, lit a candle and kindled a</p>
<p>fire in the stove.  Nataline busied herself with a score of things.</p>
<p>She put away the poor little store of provisions, sent Marcel for a</p>
<p>pail of water, made some tea, spread the table, and sat down</p>
<p>opposite to him.  For a time she kept her eyes turned away from him,</p>
<p>while she talked about all sorts of things.  Then she fell silent</p>
<p>for a little, still not looking at him.  She got up and moved about</p>
<p>the room, arranged two or three packages on the shelves, shut the</p>
<p>damper of the stove, glancing at Marcel&#x27;s back out of the corners of</p>
<p>her eyes.  Then she came back to her chair, pushed her cup aside,</p>
<p>rested both elbows on the table and her chin in her hands, and</p>
<p>looked Marcel square in the face with her clear brown eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;My friend,&quot; she said, &quot;are you an honest man, un brave garcon?&quot;</p>
<p>For an instant he could say nothing.  He was so puzzled.  &quot;Why yes,</p>
<p>Nataline,&quot; he answered, &quot;yes, surely--I hope.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then let me speak to you without fear,&quot; she continued.  &quot;You do not</p>
<p>suppose that I am ignorant of what I have done this night.  I am not</p>
<p>a baby.  You are a man.  I am a girl.  We are shut up alone in this</p>
<p>house for two weeks, a month, God knows how long.  You know what</p>
<p>that means, what people will say.  I have risked all that a girl has</p>
<p>most precious.  I have put my good name in your hands.&quot;</p>
<p>Marcel tried to speak, but she stopped him.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me finish.  It is not easy to say.  I know you are honourable.</p>
<p>I trust you waking and sleeping.  But I am a woman.  There must be</p>
<p>no love-making.  We have other work to do.  The light must not fail.</p>
<p>You will not touch me, you will not embrace me--not once--till after</p>
<p>the boat has come.  Then&quot;--she smiled at him like a sunburned angel--</p>
<p>&quot;well, is it a bargain?&quot;</p>
<p>She put out one hand across the table.  Marcel took it in both of</p>
<p>his own.  He did not kiss it.  He lifted it up in front of his face.</p>
<p>&quot;I swear to you, Nataline, you shall be to me as the Blessed Virgin</p>
<p>herself.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day they put the light in order, and the following night</p>
<p>they kindled it.  They still feared another attack from the</p>
<p>mainland, and thought it needful that one of them should be on guard</p>
<p>all the time, though the machine itself was working beautifully and</p>
<p>needed little watching.  Nataline took the night duty; it was her</p>
<p>own choice; she loved the charge of the lamp.  Marcel was on duty</p>
<p>through the day.  They were together for three or four hours in the</p>
<p>morning and in the evening.</p>
<p>It was not a desperate vigil like that affair with the broken</p>
<p>clockwork eight years before.  There was no weary turning of the</p>
<p>crank.  There was just enough work to do about the house and the</p>
<p>tower to keep them busy.  The weather was fair.  The worst thing was</p>
<p>the short supply of food.  But though they were hungry, they were</p>
<p>not starving.  And Nataline still played the fife.  She jested, she</p>
<p>sang, she told long fairy stories while they sat in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Marcel admitted that it was not at all a bad arrangement.</p>
<p>But his thoughts turned very often to the arrival of the supply-</p>
<p>boat.  He hoped it would not be late.  The ice was well broken up</p>
<p>already and driven far out into the gulf.  The boat ought to be able</p>
<p>to run down the shore in good time.</p>
<p>One evening as Nataline came down from her sleep she saw Marcel</p>
<p>coming up the rocks dragging a young seal behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurra!&quot; he shouted, &quot;here is plenty of meat.  I shot it out at the</p>
<p>end of the island, about an hour ago.&quot;</p>
<p>But Nataline said that they did not need the seal.  There was still</p>
<p>food enough in the larder.  On shore there must be greater need.</p>
<p>Marcel must take the seal over to the mainland that night and leave</p>
<p>it on the beach near the priest&#x27;s house.  He grumbled a little, but</p>
<p>he did it.</p>
<p>That was on the twenty-third of April.  The clear sky held for three</p>
<p>days longer, calm, bright, halcyon weather.  On the afternoon of the</p>
<p>twenty-seventh the clouds came down from the north, not a long</p>
<p>furious tempest, but a brief, sharp storm, with considerable wind</p>
<p>and a whirling, blinding fall of April snow.  It was a bad night for</p>
<p>boats at sea, confusing, bewildering, a night when the lighthouse</p>
<p>had to do its best.  Nataline was in the tower all night, tending</p>
<p>the lamp, watching the clockwork.  Once it seemed to her that the</p>
<p>lantern was so covered with snow that light could not shine through.</p>
<p>She got her long brush and scraped the snow away.  It was cold work,</p>
<p>but she gloried in it.  The bright eye of the tower, winking,</p>
<p>winking steadily through the storm seemed to be the sign of her</p>
<p>power in the world.  It was hers.  She kept it shining.</p>
<p>When morning came the wind was still blowing fitfully off shore, but</p>
<p>the snow had almost ceased.  Nataline stopped the clockwork, and was</p>
<p>just climbing up into the lantern to put out the lamp, when Marcel&#x27;s</p>
<p>voice hailed her.</p>
<p>&quot;Come down, Nataline, come down quick.  Make haste!&quot;</p>
<p>She turned and hurried out, not knowing what was to come; perhaps a</p>
<p>message of trouble from the mainland, perhaps a new assault on the</p>
<p>lighthouse.</p>
<p>As she came out of the tower, her brown eyes heavy from the night-</p>
<p>watch, her dark face pale from the cold, she saw Marcel standing on</p>
<p>the rocky knoll beside the house and pointing shoreward.</p>
<p>She ran up beside him and looked.  There, in the deep water between</p>
<p>the island and the point, lay the supply-boat, rocking quietly on</p>
<p>the waves.</p>
<p>It flashed upon her in a moment what it meant--the end of her fight,</p>
<p>relief for the village, victory!  And the light that had guided the</p>
<p>little ship safe through the stormy night into the harbour was hers.</p>
<p>She turned and looked up at the lamp, still burning.</p>
<p>&quot;I kept you!&quot; she cried.</p>
<p>Then she turned to Marcel; the colour rose quickly in her cheeks,</p>
<p>the light sparkled in her eyes; she smiled, and held out both her</p>
<p>hands, whispering, &quot;Now you shall keep me!&quot;</p>
<p>There was a fine wedding on the last day of April, and from that</p>
<p>time the island took its new name,--the Isle of the Wise Virgin.</p>
