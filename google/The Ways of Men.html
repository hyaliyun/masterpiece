Men</h1></header><p>The Ways of Men</p>
<p>by Eliot Gregory</p>
<p>Chapter 1 - &quot;UNCLE SAM&quot;</p>
<p>THE gentleman who graced the gubernatorial arm-chair of our  state when this century was born happened to be an admirer of  classic lore and the sonorous names of antiquity.</p>
<p>It is owing to his weakness in bestowing pompous cognomens on  our embryo towns and villages that to-day names like Utica,  Syracuse, and Ithaca, instead of evoking visions of historic  pomp and circumstance, raise in the minds of most Americans  the picture of cocky little cities, rich only in trolley-cars  and Methodist meeting-houses.</p>
<p>When, however, this cultured governor, in his ardor,  christened one of the cities Troy, and the hill in its  vicinity Mount Ida, he little dreamed that a youth was living  on its slopes whose name was destined to become a household  word the world over, as the synonym for the proudest and  wealthiest republic yet known to history, a sobriquet that  would be familiar in the mouths of races to whose continents  even the titles of Jupiter or Mars had never penetrated.</p>
<p>A little before this century began, two boys with packs bound  on their stalwart shoulders walked from New York and  established a brickyard in the neighborhood of what is now  Perry Street, Troy.  Ebenezer and Samuel Wilson soon became  esteemed citizens of the infant city, their kindliness and  benevolence winning for them the affection and respect of the  community.</p>
<p>The younger brother, Samuel, was an especial favorite with the  children of the place, whose explorations into his deep  pockets were generally rewarded by the discovery of some  simple &quot;sweet&quot; or home-made toy.  The slender youth with the  &quot;nutcracker&quot; face proving to be the merriest of playfellows,  in their love his little band of admirers gave him the pet  name of &quot;Uncle Sam,&quot; by which he quickly became known, to the  exclusion of his real name.  This is the kindly and humble  origin of a title the mere speaking of which to-day quickens  the pulse and moistens the eyes of millions of Americans with  the same thrill that the dear old flag arouses when we catch  sight of it, especially an unexpected glimpse in some foreign  land.</p>
<p>With increasing wealth the brick-yard of the Wilson brothers  was replaced by an extensive slaughtering business, in which  more than a hundred men were soon employed - a vast  establishment for that day, killing weekly some thousand head  of cattle.  During the military operations of 1812 the  brothers signed a contract to furnish the troops at Greenbush  with meat, &quot;packed in full bound barrels of white oak&quot;; soon  after, Samuel was appointed Inspector of Provisions for the  army.</p>
<p>It is a curious coincidence that England also should have  taken an ex-army-contractor as her patron saint, for if we are  to believe tradition, St. George of Cappadocia filled that  position unsatisfactorily before he passed through martyrdom  to sainthood.</p>
<p>True prototype of the nation that was later to adopt him as  its godfather, the shrewd and honest patriot, &quot;Uncle Sam,&quot; not  only lived loyally up to his contracts, giving full measure  and of his best, but proved himself incorruptible, making it  his business to see that others too fulfilled their  engagements both in the letter and the spirit; so that the  &quot;U.S.&quot; (abbreviation of United States) which he pencilled on  all provisions that had passed his inspection became in the  eyes of officers and soldiers a guarantee of excellence.   Samuel&#x27;s old friends, the boys of Troy (now enlisted in the  army), naively imagining that the mystic initials were an  allusion to the pet name they had given him years before,  would accept no meats but &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s,&quot; murmuring if other  viands were offered them.  Their comrades without inquiry  followed this example; until so strong did the prejudice for  food marked &quot;U.S.&quot; become, that other contractors, in order  that their provisions should find favor with the soldiers,  took to announcing &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; brands.</p>
<p>To the greater part of the troops, ignorant (as are most  Americans to-day) of the real origin of this pseudonym, &quot;Uncle  Sam&#x27;s&quot; beef and bread meant merely government provisions, and  the step from national belongings to an impersonation of our  country by an ideal &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; was but a logical sequence.</p>
<p>In his vigorous old age, Samuel Wilson again lived on Mount  Ida, near the estates of the Warren family, where as children  we were taken to visit his house and hear anecdotes of the  aged patriot&#x27;s hospitality and humor.  The honor in which he  was held by the country-side, the influence for good he  exerted, and the informal tribunal he held, to which his  neighbors came to get their differences straightened out by  his common sense, are still talked of by the older  inhabitants.  One story in particular used to charm our boyish  ears.  It was about a dispute over land between the  Livingstons and the Van Rensselaers, which was brought to an  end by &quot;Uncle Sam&#x27;s&quot; producing a barrel of old papers  (confided to him by both families during the war, for safe  keeping) and extracting from this original &quot;strong box&quot; title  deeds to the property in litigation.</p>
<p>Now, in these troubled times of ours, when rumors of war are  again in the air, one&#x27;s thoughts revert with pleasure to the  half-mythical figure on the threshold of the century, and to  legends of the clear-eyed giant, with the quizzical smile and  the tender, loyal heart, whose life&#x27;s work makes him a more  lovable model and a nobler example to hold up before the youth  of to-day than all the mythological deities that ever  disported themselves on the original Mount Ida.</p>
<p>There is a singular fitness in this choice of &quot;Uncle Sam&quot; as  our patron saint, for to be honest and loyal and modest, to  love little children, to do one&#x27;s duty quietly in the heyday  of life, and become a mediator in old age, is to fulfil about  the whole duty of man; and every patriotic heart must wish the  analogy may be long maintained, that our loved country, like  its prototype, may continue the protector of the feeble and a  peace-maker among nations.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 - Domestic Despots</p>
<p>THOSE who walk through the well-to-do quarters of our city,  and glance, perhaps a little enviously as they pass, toward  the cheerful firesides, do not reflect that in almost every  one of these apparently happy homes a pitiless tyrant reigns,  a misshapen monster without bowels of compassion or thought  beyond its own greedy appetites, who sits like Sinbad&#x27;s awful  burden on the necks of tender women and distracted men.   Sometimes this incubus takes the form of a pug, sometimes of a  poodle, or simply a bastard cur admitted to the family bosom  in a moment of unreflecting pity; size and pedigree are of no  importance; the result is always the same.  Once Caliban is  installed in his stronghold, peace and independence desert  that roof.</p>
<p>We read daily of fathers tyrannizing over trembling families,  of stepmothers and unnatural children turning what might be  happy homes into amateur Infernos, and sigh, as we think of  martyrdoms endured by overworked animals.</p>
<p>It is cheering to know that societies have been formed for the  protection of dumb brutes and helpless children.  Will no  attempt be made to alleviate this other form of suffering,  which has apparently escaped the eye of the reformer?</p>
<p>The animal kingdom is divided - like all Gaul - into three  divisions: wild beasts, that are obliged to hustle for  themselves; laboring and producing animals, for which man  provides because they are useful to him - and dogs!  Of all  created things on our globe the canine race have the softest  &quot;snap.&quot;  The more one thinks about this curious exception in  their favor the more unaccountable it appears.  We neglect  such wild things as we do not slaughter, and exact toil from  domesticated animals in return for their keep.  Dogs alone,  shirking all cares and labor, live in idle comfort at man&#x27;s  expense.</p>
<p>When that painful family jar broke up the little garden party  in Eden and forced our first parents to work or hunt for a  living, the original Dog (equally disgusted with either  alternative) hit on the luminous idea of posing as the  champion of the disgraced couple, and attached himself to Adam  and Eve; not that he approved of their conduct, but simply  because he foresaw that if he made himself companionable and  cosy he would be asked to stay to dinner.</p>
<p>From that day to the present, with the exception of  occasionally watching sheep and houses - a lazy occupation at  the best - and a little light carting in Belgium (dogs were  given up as turn-spits centuries ago, because they performed  that duty badly), no canine has raised a paw to do an honest  day&#x27;s work, neither has any member of the genus been known  voluntarily to perform a useful act.</p>
<p>How then - one asks one&#x27;s self in a wonder - did the myth  originate that Dog was the friend of Man?  Like a multitude of  other fallacies taught to innocent children, this folly must  be unlearned later.  Friend of man, indeed!  Why, the &quot;Little  Brothers of the Rich&quot; are guileless philanthropists in  comparison with most canines, and unworthy to be named in the  same breath with them.  Dogs discovered centuries ago that to  live in luxury, it was only necessary to assume an exaggerated  affection for some wealthy mortal, and have since proved  themselves past masters in a difficult art in which few men  succeed.  The number of human beings who manage to live on  their friends is small, whereas the veriest mongrel cur  contrives to enjoy food and lodging at some dupe&#x27;s expense.</p>
<p>Facts such as these, however, have not over-thrown the great  dog myth.  One can hardly open a child&#x27;s book without coming  across some tale of canine intelligence and devotion.  My  tender youth was saddened by the story of one disinterested  dog that refused to leave his master&#x27;s grave and was found  frozen at his post on a bleak winter&#x27;s morning.  With the  experience of years in pet dogs I now suspect that, instead of  acting in this theatrical fashion, that pup trotted home from  the funeral with the most prosperous and simple-minded couple  in the neighborhood, and after a substantial meal went to  sleep by the fire.  He must have been a clever dog to get so  much free advertisement, so probably strolled out to his  master&#x27;s grave the next noon, when people were about to hear  him, and howled a little to keep up appearances.</p>
<p>I have written &quot;the richest and most simple minded couple,&quot;  because centuries of self-seeking have developed in these  beasts an especial aptitude for spotting possible victims at a  glance.  You will rarely find dogs coquetting with the strong- minded or wasting blandishments where there is not the  probability of immediate profit; but once let even a puppy get  a tenderhearted girl or aged couple under his influence, no  pity will be shown the victims.</p>
<p>There is a house not a square away from Mr. Gerry&#x27;s  philanthropic headquarters, where a state of things exists  calculated to extract tears from a custom-house official.  Two  elderly virgins are there held in bondage by a Minotaur no  bigger than your two fists.  These good dames have a taste for  travelling, but change of climate disagrees with their tyrant.   They dislike house-keeping and, like good Americans, would  prefer hotel life, nevertheless they keep up an establishment  in a cheerless side street, with a retinue of servants,  because, forsooth, their satrap exacts a back yard where he  can walk of a morning.  These spinsters, although loving  sisters, no longer go about together, Caligula&#x27;s nerves being  so shaken that solitude upsets them.  He would sooner expire  than be left alone with the servant, for the excellent reason  that his bad temper and absurd airs have made him dangerous  enemies below stairs - and he knows it!</p>
<p>Another household in this city revolves around two brainless,  goggle-eyed beasts, imported at much expense from the slopes  of Fuji-yama.  The care that is lavished on those heathen  monsters passes belief.  Maids are employed to carry them up  and down stairs, and men are called in the night to hurry for  a doctor when Chi has over-eaten or Fu develops colic; yet  their devoted mistress tells me, with tears in her eyes, that  in spite of this care, when she takes her darlings for a walk  they do not know her from the first stranger that passes, and  will follow any boy who whistles to them in the street.</p>
<p>What revolts me in the character of dogs is that, not content  with escaping from the responsibilities entailed on all the  other inhabitants of our globe by the struggle for existence,  these four-legged Pecksniffs have succeeded in making for  themselves a fallacious reputation for honesty and devotion.   What little lingering belief I had in canine fidelity  succumbed then I was told that St. Bernards - those models of  integrity and courage - have fallen into the habit of carrying  the flasks of brandy that the kind monks provide for the  succor of snowbound travellers, to the neighboring hamlets and  exchanging the contents for - chops!</p>
<p>Will the world ever wake to the true character of these four- legged impostors and realize that instead of being  disinterested and sincere, most family pets are consummate  hypocrites.  Innocent?  Pshaw!  Their pretty, coaxing ways and  pretences of affection are unadulterated guile; their  ostentatious devotion, simply a clever manoeuvre to excite  interest and obtain unmerited praise.  It is useless, however,  to hope that things will change.  So long as this giddy old  world goes on waltzing in space, so long shall we continue to  be duped by shams and pin our faith on frauds, confounding an  attractive bearing with a sweet disposition and mistaking  dishevelled hair and eccentric appearance for brains.  Even in  the Orient, where dogs have been granted immunity from other  labor on the condition that they organized an effective  street-cleaning department, they have been false to their  trust and have evaded their contracts quite as if they were  Tammany braves, like whom they pass their days in slumber and  their nights in settling private disputes, while the city  remains uncleaned.</p>
<p>I nurse yet another grudge against the canine race!  That  Voltaire of a whelp, who imposed himself upon our confiding  first parents, must have had an important pull at  headquarters, for he certainly succeeded in getting the decree  concerning beauty and fitness which applies to all mammals,  including man himself, reversed in favor of dogs, and handed  down to his descendants the secret of making defects and  deformities pass current as qualities.  While other animals  are valued for sleek coats and slender proportions, canine  monstrosities have always been in demand.  We do not admire  squints or protruding under jaws in our own race, yet bulldogs  have persuaded many weak-minded people that these defects are  charming when combined in an individual of their breed.</p>
<p>The fox in the fable, who after losing his tail tried to make  that bereavement the fashion, failed in his undertaking; Dutch  canal-boat dogs have, however, been successful where the fox  failed, and are to-day pampered and prized for a curtailment  that would condemn any other animal (except perhaps a Manx  cat) to a watery grave at birth.</p>
<p>I can only recall two instances where canine sycophants got  their deserts; the first tale (probably apocryphal) is about a  donkey, for years the silent victim of a little terrier who  had been trained to lead him to water and back.  The dog - as  might have been expected - abused the situation, while  pretending to be very kind to his charge, never allowed him to  roll on the grass, as he would have liked, or drink in peace,  and harassed the poor beast in many other ways, getting,  however, much credit from the neighbors for devotion and  intelligence.  Finally, one day after months of waiting, the  patient victim&#x27;s chance came.  Getting his tormentor well out  into deep water, the donkey quietly sat down on him.</p>
<p>The other tale is true, for I knew the lady who provided in  her will that her entire establishment should be kept up for  the comfort and during the life of the three fat spaniels that  had solaced her declining years.  The heirs tried to break the  will and failed; the delighted domestics, seeing before them a  period of repose, proceeded (headed by the portly housekeeper)  to consult a &quot;vet&quot; as to how the life of the precious legatees  might be prolonged to the utmost.  His advice was to stop all  sweets and rich food and give each of the animals at least  three hours of hard exercise a day.  From that moment the lazy  brutes led a dog&#x27;s life.  Water and the detested &quot;Spratt&quot;  biscuit, scorned in happier days, formed their meagre  ordinary; instead of somnolent airings in a softly cushioned  landau they were torn from chimney corner musings to be raced  through cold, muddy streets by a groom on horseback.</p>
<p>Those two tales give me the keenest pleasure.  When I am  received on entering a friend&#x27;s room with a chorus of yelps  and attacked in dark corners by snarling little hypocrites who  fawn on me in their master&#x27;s presence, I humbly pray that some  such Nemesis may be in store for these FAUX BONHOMMES before  they leave this world, as apparently no provision has been  made for their punishment in the next.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 - Cyrano, Rostand, Coquelin</p>
<p>AMONG the proverbs of Spanish folk-lore there is a saying that  good wine retains its flavor in spite of rude bottles and  cracked cups.  The success of M. Rostand&#x27;s brilliant drama,  CYRANO DE BERGERAC, in its English dress proves once more the  truth of this adage.  The fun and pathos, the wit and satire,  of the original pierce through the halting, feeble translation  like light through a ragged curtain, dazzling the spectators  and setting their enthusiasm ablaze.</p>
<p>Those who love the theatre at its best, when it appeals to our  finer instincts and moves us to healthy laughter and tears,  owe a debt of gratitude to Richard Mansfield for his courage  in giving us, as far as the difference of language and rhythm  would allow, this CHEF D&#x27;OEUVRE unchanged, free from the  mutilations of the adapter, with the author&#x27;s wishes and the  stage decorations followed into the smallest detail.  In this  way we profit by the vast labor and study which Rostand and  Coquelin gave to the original production.</p>
<p>Rumors of the success attained by this play in Paris soon  floated across to us.  The two or three French booksellers  here could not import the piece fast enough to meet the ever  increasing demand of our reading public.  By the time spring  came, there were few cultivated people who had not read the  new work and discussed its original language and daring  treatment.</p>
<p>On arriving in Paris, my first evening was passed at the Porte  St. Martin.  After the piece was over, I dropped into  Coquelin&#x27;s dressing-room to shake this old acquaintance by the  hand and give him news of his many friends in America.</p>
<p>Coquelin in his dressing-room is one of the most delightful of  mortals.  The effort of playing sets his blood in motion and  his wit sparkling.  He seemed as fresh and gay that evening as  though there were not five killing acts behind him and the  fatigue of a two-hundred-night run, uninterrupted even by  Sundays, added to his &quot;record.&quot;</p>
<p>After the operation of removing his historic nose had been  performed and the actor had resumed his own clothes and  features, we got into his carriage and were driven to his  apartment in the Place de l&#x27;Etoile, a cosy museum full of  comfortable chairs and priceless bric-a-brac.  The  conversation naturally turned during supper on the piece and  this new author who had sprung in a night from obscurity to a  globe-embracing fame.  How, I asked, did you come across the  play, and what decided you to produce it?</p>
<p>Coquelin&#x27;s reply was so interesting that it will be better to  repeat the actor&#x27;s own words as he told his tale over the  dismantled table in the tranquil midnight hours.</p>
<p>&quot;I had, like most Parisians, known Rostand for some time as  the author of a few graceful verses and a play (LES  ROMANESQUES)which passed almost unnoticed at the Francais.</p>
<p>&quot;About four years ago Sarah Bernhardt asked me to her `hotel&#x27;  to hear M. Rostand read a play he had just completed for her.   I accepted reluctantly, as at that moment we were busy at the  theatre.  I also doubted if there could be much in the new  play to interest me.  It was LA PRINCESSE LOINTAINE.  I shall  remember that afternoon as long as I live!  From the first  line my attention was riveted and my senses were charmed.   What struck me as even more remarkable than the piece was the  masterly power and finish with which the boyish author  delivered his lines.  Where, I asked myself, had he learned  that difficult art?  The great actress, always quick to  respond to the voice of art, accepted the play then and there.</p>
<p>&quot;After the reading was over I walked home with M. Rostand, and  had a long talk with him about his work and ambitions.  When  we parted at his door, I said: `In my opinion, you are  destined to become the greatest dramatic poet of the age; I  bind myself here and now to take any play you write (in which  there is a part for me) without reading it, to cancel any  engagements I may have on hand, and produce your piece with  the least possible delay.&#x27; An offer I don&#x27;t imagine many young  poets have ever received, and which I certainly never before  made to any author.</p>
<p>&quot;About six weeks later my new acquaintance dropped in one  morning to read me the sketch he had worked out for a drama,  the title role of which he thought would please me.  I was  delighted with the idea, and told him to go ahead.  A month  later we met in the street.  On asking him how the play was  progressing, to my astonishment he answered that he had  abandoned that idea and hit upon something entirely different.   Chance had thrown in his way an old volume of Cyrano de  Bergerac&#x27;s poems, which so delighted him that he had been  reading up the life and death of that unfortunate poet.  From  this reading had sprung the idea of making Cyrano the central  figure of a drama laid in the city of Richelieu, d&#x27;Artagnan,  and the PRECIEUSES RIDICULES, a seventeenth-century Paris of  love and duelling.</p>
<p>&quot;At first this idea struck me as unfortunate.  The elder Dumas  had worked that vein so well and so completely, I doubted if  any literary gold remained for another author.  It seemed  foolhardy to resuscitate the THREE GUARDSMEN epoch - and I  doubted if it were possible to carry out his idea and play an  intense and pathetic role disguised with a burlesque nose.</p>
<p>&quot;This contrasting of the grotesque and the sentimental was of  course not new.  Victor Hugo had broken away from classic  tradition when he made a hunchback the hero of a drama.  There  remained, however, the risk of our Parisian public not  accepting the new situation seriously.  It seemed to me like  bringing the sublime perilously near the ridiculous.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately, Rostand did not share this opinion or my doubts.   He was full of enthusiasm for his piece and confident of its  success.  We sat where we had met, under the trees of the  Champs Elysees, for a couple of hours, turning the subject  about and looking at the question from every point of view.   Before we parted the poet had convinced me.  The role, as he  conceived it, was certainly original, and therefore tempting,  opening vast possibilities before my dazzled eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I found out later that Rostand had gone straight home after  that conversation and worked for nearly twenty hours without  leaving the study, where his wife found him at daybreak, fast  asleep with his head on a pile of manuscript.  He was at my  rooms the next day before I was up, sitting on the side of my  bed, reading the result of his labor.  As the story unfolded  itself I was more and more delighted.  His idea of  resuscitating the quaint interior of the Hotel de Bourgogne  Theatre was original, and the balcony scene, even in outline,  enchanting.  After the reading Rostand dashed off as he had  come, and for many weeks I saw no more of him.</p>
<p>&quot;LA PRINCESSE LOINTAINE was, in the meantime, produced by  Sarah, first in London and then in Paris.  In the English  capital it was a failure; with us it gained a SUCCES D&#x27;ESTIME,  the fantastic grace and lightness of the piece saving it from  absolute shipwreck in the eyes of the literary public.</p>
<p>&quot;Between ourselves,&quot; continued Coquelin, pushing aside his  plate, a twinkle in his small eyes, &quot;is the reason of this  lack of success very difficult to discover?  The Princess in  the piece is supposed to be a fairy enchantress in her  sixteenth year.  The play turns on her youth and innocence.   Now, honestly, is Sarah, even on the stage, any one&#x27;s ideal of  youth and innocence?&quot;  This was asked so naively that I burst  into a laugh, in which my host joined me.  Unfortunately, this  grandmamma, like Ellen Terry, cannot be made to understand  that there are roles she should leave alone, that with all the  illusions the stage lends she can no longer play girlish parts  with success.</p>
<p>&quot;The failure of his play produced the most disastrous effect  on Rostand, who had given up a year of his life to its  composition and was profoundly chagrined by its fall.  He sank  into a mild melancholy, refusing for more than eighteen months  to put pen to paper.  On the rare occasions when we met I  urged him to pull himself together and rise above  disappointment.  Little by little, his friends were able to  awaken his dormant interest and get him to work again on  CYRANO.  As he slowly regained confidence and began taking  pleasure once more in his work, the boyish author took to  dropping in on me at impossible morning hours to read some  scene hot from his ardent brain.  When seated by my bedside,  he declaimed his lines until, lit at his flame, I would jump  out of bed, and wrapping my dressing-gown hastily around me,  seize the manuscript out of his hands, and, before I knew it,  find my self addressing imaginary audiences, poker in hand, in  lieu of a sword, with any hat that came to hand doing duty for  the plumed headgear of our hero.  Little by little, line upon  line, the masterpiece grew under his hands.  My career as an  actor has thrown me in with many forms of literary industry  and dogged application, but the power of sustained effort and  untiring, unflagging zeal possessed by that fragile youth  surpassed anything I had seen.</p>
<p>&quot;As the work began taking form, Rostand hired a place in the  country, so that no visitors or invitations might tempt him  away from his daily toil.  Rich, young, handsome, married to a  woman all Paris was admiring, with every door, social or  Bohemian, wide open before his birth and talent, he  voluntarily shut himself up for over a year in a dismal  suburb, allowing no amusement to disturb his incessant toil.   Mme. Rostand has since told me that at one time she seriously  feared for his reason if not for his life, as he averaged ten  hours a day steady work, and when the spell was on him would  pass night after night at his study table, rewriting, cutting,  modelling his play, never contented, always striving after a  more expressive adjective, a more harmonious or original  rhyme, casting aside a month&#x27;s finished work without a second  thought when he judged that another form expressed his idea  more perfectly.</p>
<p>&quot;That no success is cheaply bought I have long known; my  profession above all others is calculated to teach one that  truth.</p>
<p>&quot;If Rostand&#x27;s play is the best this century has produced, and  our greatest critics are unanimous in pronouncing it equal, if  not superior, to Victor Hugo&#x27;s masterpieces, the young author  has not stolen his laurels, but gained them leaf by leaf  during endless midnight hours of brain-wringing effort - a  price that few in a generation would be willing to give or  capable of giving for fame.  The labor had been in proportion  to the success; it always is!  I doubt if there is one word in  his `duel&#x27; ballad that has not been changed again and again  for a more fitting expression, as one might assort the shades  of a mosaic until a harmonious whole is produced.  I have  there in my desk whole scenes that he discarded because they  were not essential to the action of the piece.  They will  probably never be printed, yet are as brilliant and cost their  author as much labor as any that the public applauded to- night.</p>
<p>&quot;As our rehearsals proceeded I saw another side of Rostand&#x27;s  character; the energy and endurance hidden in his almost  effeminate frame astonished us all.  He almost lived at the  theatre, drilling each actor, designing each costume, ordering  the setting of each scene.  There was not a dress that he did  not copy from some old print, or a PASSADE that he did not  indicate to the humblest member of the troop.  The marvellous  diction that I had noticed during the reading at Sarah&#x27;s  served him now and gave the key to the entire performance.  I  have never seen him peevish or discouraged, but always  courteous and cheerful through all those weary weeks of  repetition, when even the most enthusiastic feel their courage  oozing away under the awful grind of afternoon and evening  rehearsal, the latter beginning at midnight after the regular  performance was over.</p>
<p>&quot;The news was somehow spread among the theatre-loving public  that something out if the ordinary was in preparation.  The  papers took up the tale and repeated it until the whole  capital was keyed up to concert pitch.  The opening night was  eagerly awaited by the critics, the literary and the artistic  worlds.  When the curtain rose on the first act there was the  emotion of a great event floating in the air.&quot;  Here  Coquelin&#x27;s face assumed an intense expression I had rarely  seen there before.  He was back on the stage, living over  again the glorious hours of that night&#x27;s triumph.  His breath  was coming quick and his eyes aglow with the memory of that  evening.  &quot;Never, never have I lived through such an evening.   Victor Hugo&#x27;s greatest triumph, the first night of HERNANI,  was the only theatrical event that can compare to it.  It,  however, was injured by the enmity of a clique who  persistently hissed the new play.  There is but one phrase to  express the enthusiasm at our first performance - UNE SALLE EN  DELIRE gives some idea of what took place.  As the curtain  fell on each succeeding act the entire audience would rise to  its feet, shouting and cheering for ten minutes at a time.   The coulisse and the dressing-rooms were packed by the critics  and the author&#x27;s friends, beside themselves with delight.  I  was trembling so I could hardly get from one costume into  another, and had to refuse my door to every one.  Amid all  this confusion Rostand alone remained cool and seemed  unconscious of his victory.  He continued quietly giving last  recommendations to the figurants, overseeing the setting of  the scenes, and thanking the actors as they came off the  stage, with the same self-possessed urbanity he had shown  during the rehearsals.  Finally, when the play was over, and  we had time to turn and look for him, our author had  disappeared, having quietly driven off with his wife to their  house in the country, from which he never moved for a week.&quot;</p>
<p>It struck two o&#x27;clock as Coquelin ended.  The sleepless city  had at last gone to rest.  At our feet, as we stood by the  open window, the great square around the Arc de Triomphe lay  silent and empty, its vast arch rising dimly against the night  sky.</p>
<p>As I turned to go, Coquelin took my hand and remarked,  smiling: &quot;Now you have heard the story of a genius, an actor,  and a masterpiece.&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 4 - Machine-made Men</p>
<p>AMONG the commonplace white and yellow envelopes that compose  the bulk of one&#x27;s correspondence, appear from time to time  dainty epistles on tinted paper, adorned with crests or  monograms.  &quot;Ha! ha!&quot; I think when one of these appears, &quot;here  is something worth opening!&quot;  For between ourselves, reader  mine, old bachelors love to receive notes from women.  It&#x27;s so  flattering to be remembered by the dear creatures, and recalls  the time when life was beginning, and POULETS in feminine  writing suggested such delightful possibilities.</p>
<p>Only this morning an envelope of delicate Nile green caused me  a distinct thrill of anticipation.  To judge by appearances it  could contain nothing less attractive than a declaration, so,  tearing it hurriedly open, I read: &quot;Messrs. Sparks &amp; Splithers  take pleasure in calling attention to their patent suspenders  and newest designs in reversible paper collars!&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if that&#x27;s not enough to put any man in a bad humor for  twenty-four hours, I should like to know what is?  Moreover, I  have &quot;patents&quot; in horror, experience having long ago revealed  the fact that a patent is pretty sure to be only a new way of  doing fast and cheaply something that formerly was  accomplished slowly and well.</p>
<p>Few people stop to think how quickly this land of ours is  degenerating into a paradise of the cheap and nasty, but allow  themselves to be heated and cooled and whirled about the  streets to the detriment of their nerves and digestions, under  the impression that they are enjoying the benefits of modern  progress.</p>
<p>So complex has life become in these later days that the very  beds we lie on and the meals we eat are controlled by patents.   Every garment and piece of furniture now pays a &quot;royalty&quot; to  some inventor, from the hats on our heads to the carpets under  foot, which latter are not only manufactured, but cleaned and  shaken by machinery, and (be it remarked EN PASSANT) lose  their nap prematurely in the process.  To satisfy our national  love of the new, an endless and nameless variety of trifles  appears each season, so-called labor and time-saving  combinations, that enjoy a brief hour of vogue, only to make  way for a newer series of inventions.</p>
<p>As long as our geniuses confined themselves to making life one  long and breathless scramble, it was bad enough, but a line  should have been drawn where meddling with the sanctity of the  toilet began.  This, alas! was not done.  Nothing has remained  sacred to the inventor.  In consequence, the average up-to- date American is a walking collection of Yankee notions, an  ingenious illusion, made up of patents, requiring as nice  adjustment to put together and undo as a thirteenth-century  warrior, and carrying hardly less metal about his person than  a Crusader of old.</p>
<p>There are a number of haberdashery shops on Broadway that have  caused me to waste many precious minutes gazing into their  windows and wondering what the strange instruments of steel  and elastic could be, that were exhibited alongside of the  socks and ties.  The uses of these would, in all probability,  have remained wrapped in mystery but for the experience of one  fateful morning (after a night in a sleeping-car), when  countless hidden things were made clear, as I sat, an awe- struck witness to my fellow-passengers&#x27; - toilets? - No!   Getting their machinery into running order for the day, would  be a more correct expression.</p>
<p>Originally, &quot;tags&quot; were the backbone of the toilet, different  garments being held together by their aid.  Later, buttons and  attendant button-holes were evolved, now replaced by the  devices used in composing the machine-made man.  As far as I  could see (I have overcome a natural delicacy in making my  discoveries public, because it seems unfair to keep all this  information to myself), nothing so archaic as a button-hole is  employed at the present time by our patent-ridden compatriots.   The shirt, for instance, which was formerly such a simple- minded and straightforward garment, knowing no guile, has  become, in the hands of the inventors, a mere pretence, a  frail scaffold, on which an elaborate superstructure of shams  is erected.</p>
<p>The varieties of this garment that one sees in the shop  windows, exposing virgin bosoms to the day, are not what they  seem!  Those very bosoms are fakes, and cannot open, being  instead pierced by eyelets, into which bogus studs are fixed  by machinery.  The owner is obliged to enter into those  deceptive garments surreptitiously from the rear, by  stratagem, as it were.  Why all this trouble, one asks, for no  apparent reason, except that old-fashioned shirts opened in  front, and no Yankee will wear a non-patented garment - if he  can help it?</p>
<p>There was not a single accessory to the toilet in that car  which behaved in a normal way.  Buttons mostly backed into  place, tail-end foremost (like horses getting between shafts),  where some hidden mechanism screwed or clinched them to their  moorings.</p>
<p>Collars and cuffs (integral parts of the primitive garment)  are now a labyrinth, in which all but the initiated must lose  themselves, being double-decked, detachable, reversible, and  made of every known substance except linen.  The cuff most in  favor can be worn four different ways, and is attached to the  shirt by a steel instrument three inches long, with a nipper  at each end.  The amount of white visible below the coat- sleeve is regulated by another contrivance, mostly of elastic,  worn further up the arm, around the biceps.  Modern collars  are retained in position by a system of screws and levers.   Socks are attached no longer with the old-fashioned garter,  but by aid of a little harness similar to that worn by pug- dogs.</p>
<p>One traveller, after lacing his shoes, adjusted a contrivance  resembling a black beetle on the knot to prevent its untying.   He also wore &quot;hygienic suspenders,&quot; a discovery of great  importance (over three thousand patents have been taken out  for this one necessity of the toilet!).  This brace performs  several tasks at the same time, such as holding unmentionable  garments in place, keeping the wearer erect, and providing a  night-key guard.  It is also said to cure liver and kidney  disease by means of an arrangement of pulleys which throw the  strain according to the wearer&#x27;s position - I omit the rest of  its qualities!</p>
<p>The watches of my companions, I noticed with astonishment, all  wore India-rubber ruffs around their necks.  Here curiosity  getting the better of discretion, I asked what purpose that  invention served.  It was graciously explained to me how such  ruffs prevented theft.  They were so made that it was  impossible to draw your watch out of a pocket unless you knew  the trick, which struck me as a mitigated blessing.  In fact,  the idea kept occurring that life might become terribly  uncomfortable under these complex conditions for absent-minded  people.</p>
<p>Pencils, I find, are no longer put into pockets or slipped  behind the ear.  Every commercial &quot;gent&quot; wears a patent on his  chest, where his pen and pencil nestle in a coil of wire.   Eyeglasses are not allowed to dangle aimlessly about, as of  old, but retire with a snap into an oval box, after the  fashion of roller shades.  Scarf-pins have guards screwed on  from behind, and undergarments - but here modesty stops my  pen.</p>
<p>Seeing that I was interested in their make-up, several  travelling agents on the train got out their boxes and showed  me the latest artifices that could be attached to the person.   One gentleman produced a collection of rings made to go on the  finger with a spring, like bracelets, an arrangement, he  explained, that was particularly convenient for people  afflicted with enlarged joints!</p>
<p>Another tempted me with what he called a &quot;literary shirt  front,&quot; - it was in fact a paper pad, from which for  cleanliness a leaf could be peeled each morning; the &quot;wrong&quot;  side of the sheet thus removed contained a calendar, much  useful information, and the chapters of a &quot;continued&quot; story,  which ended when the &quot;dickey&quot; was used up.</p>
<p>A third traveller was &quot;pushing&quot; a collar-button that plied as  many trades as Figaro, combining the functions of cravat- holder, stud, and scarf-pin.  Not being successful in selling  me one of these, he brought forward something &quot;without which,&quot;  he assured me, &quot;no gentleman&#x27;s wardrobe was complete&quot;!  It  proved to be an insidious arrangement of gilt wire, which he  adjusted on his poor, overworked collar-button, and then tied  his cravat through and around it.  &quot;No tie thus made,&quot; he  said, &quot;would ever slip or get crooked.&quot;  He had been so civil  that it was embarrassing not to buy something of him; I  invested twenty-five cents in the cravat-holder, as it seemed  the least complicated of the patents on exhibition; not,  however, having graduated in a school of mechanics I have  never been able to make it work.  It takes an hour to tie a  cravat with its aid, and as long to get it untied.  Most of  the men in that car, I found, got around the difficulty by  wearing ready-made ties which fastened behind with a clasp.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the reason our compatriots have  such a strained and anxious look is because they are all  trying to remember the numbers of their streets and houses,  the floor their office is on, and the combination of their  safes.  I am inclined to think that the hunted look we wear  comes from an awful fear of forgetting the secrets of our  patents and being unable to undo ourselves in an emergency!</p>
<p>Think for a moment of the horror of coming home tired and  sleepy after a convivial evening, and finding that some of  your hidden machinery had gone wrong; that by a sudden  movement you had disturbed the nice balance of some lever  which in revenge refused to release its prey!  The inventors  of one well-known cuff-holder claim that it had a &quot;bull-dog  grip.&quot;  Think of sitting dressed all night in the embrace of  that mechanical canine until the inventor could be called in  to set you free!</p>
<p>I never doubted that bravery was the leading characteristic of  the American temperament; since that glimpse into the secret  composition of my compatriots, admiration has been vastly  increased.  The foolhardy daring it must require - dressed as  those men were - to go out in a thunder-storm makes one  shudder: it certainly could not be found in any other race.   The danger of cross-country hunting or bull-fighting is as  nothing compared to the risk a modern American takes when he  sits in a trolley-car, where the chances of his machinery  forming a fatal &quot;short circuit&quot; must be immense.  The utter  impossibility in which he finds himself of making a toilet  quickly on account of so many time-saving accessories must  increase his chances of getting &quot;left&quot; in an accident about  fifty per cent.  Who but one of our people could contemplate  with equanimity the thought of attempting the adjustment of  such delicate and difficult combinations while a steamer was  sinking and the life-boats being manned?</p>
<p>Our grandfathers contributed the wooden nutmeg to  civilization, and endowed a grateful universe with other  money-saving devices.  To-day the inventor takes the American  baby from his cradle and does not release him even at the  grave.  What a treat one of the machine-made men of to-day  will be to the archeologists of the year 3000, when they  chance upon a well-preserved specimen, with all his patents  thick upon I him!  With a prophetic eye one can almost see the  kindly old gentleman of that day studying the paraphernalia  found in the tomb and attempting to account for the different  pieces.  Ink will flow and discussions rage between the camp  maintaining that cuff-holders were tutelar deities buried with  the dead by pious relatives and the croup asserting that the  little pieces of steel were a form of pocket money in the year  1900.  Both will probably misquote Tennyson and Kipling in  support of their theories.</p>
<p>The question has often been raised, What side of our  nineteenth-century civilization will be most admired by future  generations?  In view of the above facts there can remain  little doubt that when the secrets of the paper collar and the  trouser-stretcher have become lost arts, it will be those  benefits that remote ages will envy us, and rare specimens of  &quot;ventilated shoes&quot; and &quot;reversible tissue-paper undergarments&quot;  will form the choicest treasures of the collector.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 - Parnassus</p>
<p>MANY years ago, a gentleman with whom I was driving in a  distant quarter of Paris took me to a house on the rue  Montparnasse, where we remained an hour or more, he chatting  with its owner, and I listening to their conversation, and  wondering at the confusion of books in the big room.  As we  drove away, my companion turned to me and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t forget  this afternoon.  You have seen one of the greatest writers our  century has produced, although the world does not yet realize  it.  You will learn to love his works when you are older, and  it will be a satisfaction to remember that you saw and spoke  with him in the flesh! &quot;</p>
<p>When I returned later to Paris the little house had changed  hands, and a marble tablet stating that Sainte-Beuve had lived  and died there adorned its facade.  My student footsteps took  me many times through that quiet street, but never without a  vision of the poet-critic flashing back, as I glanced up at  the window where he had stood and talked with us; as my friend  predicted, Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s writings had become a precious part  of my small library, the memory of his genial face adding a  vivid interest to their perusal.</p>
<p>I made a little Pilgrimage recently to the quiet old garden  where, after many years&#x27; delay, a bust of this writer has been  unveiled, with the same companion, now very old, who thirty  years ago presented me to the original.</p>
<p>There is, perhaps, in all Paris no more exquisite corner than  the Garden of the Luxembourg.  At every season it is  beautiful.  The winter sunlight seems to linger on its stately  Italian terraces after it has ceased to shine elsewhere.  The  first lilacs bloom here in the spring, and when midsummer has  turned all the rest of Paris into a blazing, white wilderness,  these gardens remain cool and tranquil in the heart of  turbulent &quot;Bohemia,&quot; a bit of fragrant nature filled with the  song of birds and the voices of children.  Surely it was a  gracious inspiration that selected this shady park as the  &quot;Poets&#x27; Corner&quot; of great, new Paris.  Henri Murger, Leconte de  Lisle, Theodore de Banville, Paul Verlaine, are here, and now  Sainte-Beuve has come back to his favorite haunt.  Like  Francois Coppee and Victor Hugo, he loved these historic  ALLEES, and knew the stone in them as he knew the &quot;Latin  Quater,&quot; for his life was passed between the bookstalls of the  quays and the outlying street where he lived.</p>
<p>As we sat resting in the shade, my companion, who had been one  of Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s pupils, fell to talking of his master, his  memory refreshed by the familiar surroundings.  &quot;Can anything  be sadder,&quot; he said, &quot;than finding a face one has loved turned  into stone, or names that were the watch-words of one&#x27;s youth  serving as signs at street corners - la rue Flaubert or  Theodore de Banville?  How far away they make the past seem!   Poor Sainte-Beuve, that bust yonder is but a poor reward for a  life of toil, a modest tribute to his encyclopaedic brain!   His works, however, are his best monument; he would be the  last to repine or cavil.</p>
<p>&quot;The literary world of my day had two poles, between which it  vibrated.  The little house in the rue Montparnasse was one,  the rock of Guernsey the other.  We spoke with awe of <code>Father  Hugo&#x27; and mentioned </code>Uncle Beuve&#x27; with tenderness.  The  Goncourt brothers accepted Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s judgment on their  work as the verdict of a <code>Supreme Court.&#x27;  Not a poet or  author of that day but climbed with a beating heart the narrow  staircase that led to the great writer&#x27;s library.  Paul  Verlaine regarded as his literary diploma a letter from this  </code>Balzac de la critique.&#x27; &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the entrance of the quaint Passage du Commerce, under the  arch that leads into the rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts, stands a  hotel, where for years Sainte-Beuve came daily to work (away  from the importunate who besieged his dwelling) in a room  hired under the assumed name of Delorme.  It was there that we  sent him a basket of fruit one morning addressed to Mr.  Delorme, NE Sainte-Beuve.  It was there that most of his  enormous labor was accomplished.</p>
<p>&quot;A curious corner of old Paris that Cour du Commerce!  Just  opposite his window was the apartment where Danton lived.  If  one chose to seek for them it would not be hard to discover on  the pavement of this same passage the marks made by a young  doctor in decapitating sheep with his newly invented machine.   The doctor&#x27;s name was Guillotin.</p>
<p>&quot;The great critic loved these old quarters filled with  history.  He was fond of explaining that Montparnasse had been  a hill where the students of the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries came to amuse themselves.  In 1761 the slope was  levelled and the boulevard laid out, but the name was  predestined, he would declare, for the habitation of the  `Parnassiens.&#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;His enemies pretended that you had but to mention Michelet,  Balzac, and Victor Hugo to see Sainte-Beuve in three degrees  of rage.  He had, it is true, distinct expressions on hearing  those authors discussed.  The phrase then much used in  speaking of an original personality, <code>He is like a character  out of Balzac,&#x27; always threw my master into a temper.  I  cannot remember, however, having seen him in one of those  famous rages which made Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly say that </code>Sainte- Beuve was a clever man with the temper of a turkey!&#x27;  The  former was much nearer the truth when he called the author of  LES LUNDIS a French Wordsworth, or compared him to a lay  BENEDICTIN.  He had a way of reading a newly acquired volume  as he walked through the streets that was typical of his life.   My master was always studying and always advancing.</p>
<p>&quot;He never entirely recovered from his mortification at being  hissed by the students on the occasion of his first lecture at  the College de France.  Returning home he loaded two pistols,  one for the first student who should again insult him, and the  other to blow out his own brains.  It was no idle threat.  The  man Guizot had nicknamed <code>Werther&#x27; was capable of executing  his plan, for this causeless unpopularity was anguish to him.   After his death, I found those two pistols loaded in his  bedroom, but justice had been done another way.  All  opposition had vanished.  Every student in the </code>Quarter&#x27;  followed the modest funeral of their Senator, who had become  the champion of literary liberty in an epoch when poetry was  held in chains.</p>
<p>&quot;The Empire which made him Senator gained, however, but an  indocile recruit.  On his one visit to Compiegne in 1863, the  Emperor, wishing to be particularly gracious, said to him, `I  always read the MONITEUR on Monday, when your article  appears.&#x27;  Unfortunately for this compliment, it was the  CONSTITUTIONNEL that had been publishing the NOUVEAUX LUNDIS  for more than four years.  In spite of the united efforts of  his friends, Sainte-Beuve could not be brought to the point of  complimenting Napoleon III. on his LIFE OF CAESAR.</p>
<p>The author of LES CONSOLATIONS remained through life the  proudest and most independent of men, a bourgeois, enemy of  all tyranny, asking protection of no one.  And what a worker!   Reading, sifting, studying, analyzing his subject before  composing one of his famous LUNDIS, a literary portrait which  he aimed at making complete and final.  One of these articles  cost him as much labor as other authors give to the  composition of a volume.</p>
<p>&quot;By way of amusement on Sunday evenings, when work was  temporarily laid aside, he loved the theatre, delighting in  every kind of play, from the broad farces of the Palais Royal  to the tragedies of Racine, and entertaining comedians in  order, as he said, <code>to keep young&#x27;!  One evening Theophile  Gautier brought a pretty actress to dinner.  Sainte-Beuve, who  was past-master in the difficult art of conversation, and on  whom a fair woman acted as an inspiration, surpassed himself  on this occasion, surprising even the Goncourts with his  knowledge of the Eighteenth century and the women of that  time, Mme. de Boufflers, Mlle. de Lespinasse, la Marechale de  Luxembourg.  The hours flew by unheeded by all of his guests  but one.  The DEBUTANTE was overheard confiding, later in the  evening, to a friend at the Gymnase, where she performed in  the last act, </code>Ouf!  I&#x27;m glad to get here.  I<code>ve been dining  with a stupid old Senator.  They told me he would be amusing,  but I&#x27;ve been bored to death.&#x27;  Which reminded me of my one  visit to England, when I heard a young nobleman declare that  he had been to </code>such a dull dinner to meet a duffer called  &quot;Renan!&quot; &#x27;</p>
<p>&quot;Sainte-Beuve&#x27;s LARMES DE RACINE was given at the Theatre  Francais during its author&#x27;s last illness.  His disappointment  at not seeing the performance was so keen that M. Thierry,  then ADMINISTRATEUR of La Comedie, took Mlle. Favart to the  rue Montparnasse, that she might recite his verses to the  dying writer.  When the actress, then in the zenith of her  fame and beauty, came to the lines-</p>
<p>Jean Racine, le grand poete, Le poete aimant et pieux, Apres que sa lyre muette Se fut voilee a tous les yeux, Renoncant a la gloire humaine, S&#x27;il sentait en son ame pleine Le flot contenu murmurer, Ne savait que fondre en priere, Pencher l&#x27;urne dans la poussiere Aux pieds du Seigneur, et pleurer!</p>
<p>the tears of Sainte-Beuve accompanied those of Racine!&quot;</p>
<p>There were tears also in the eyes my companion turned toward  me as he concluded.  The sun had set while he had been  speaking.  The marble of the statues gleamed white against the  shadows of the sombre old garden.  The guardians were closing  the gates and warning the lingering visitors as we strolled  toward the entrance.</p>
<p>It seemed as if we had been for an hour in the presence of the  portly critic; and the circle of brilliant men and witty women  who surrounded him - Flaubert, Tourgueneff, Theophile Gautier,  Renan, George Sand - were realities at that moment, not  abstractions with great names.  It was like returning from  another age, to step out again into the glare and bustle of  the Boulevard St. Michel.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 - Modern Architecture</p>
<p>IF a foreign tourist, ignorant of his whereabouts, were to  sail about sunset up our spacious bay and view for the first  time the eccentric sky-line of lower New York, he would rub  his eyes and wonder if they were not playing him a trick, for  distance and twilight lend the chaotic masses around the  Battery a certain wild grace suggestive of Titan strongholds  or prehistoric abodes of Wotan, rather than the business part  of a practical modern city.</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; as John Drew used to say in THE MASKED BALL, &quot;what a  difference in the morning!&quot; when a visit to his banker takes  the new arrival down to Wall Street, and our uncompromising  American daylight dispels his illusions.</p>
<p>Years ago SPIRITUAL Arthur Gilman mourned over the decay of  architecture in New York and pointed out that Stewart&#x27;s shop,  at Tenth Street, bore about the same relation to Ictinus&#x27;  noble art as an iron cooking stove!  It is well death removed  the Boston critic before our city entered into its present  Brobdingnagian phase.  If he considered that Stewart&#x27;s and the  Fifth Avenue Hotel failed in artistic beauty, what would have  been his opinion of the graceless piles that crowd our island  to-day, beside which those older buildings seem almost  classical in their simplicity?</p>
<p>One hardly dares to think what impression a student familiar  with the symmetry of Old World structures must receive on  arriving for the first time, let us say, at the Bowling Green,  for the truth would then dawn upon him that what appeared from  a distance to be the ground level of the island was in reality  the roof line of average four-story buildings, from among  which the keeps and campaniles that had so pleased him (when  viewed from the Narrows) rise like gigantic weeds gone to seed  in a field of grass.</p>
<p>It is the heterogeneous character of the buildings down town  that renders our streets so hideous.  Far from seeking  harmony, builders seem to be trying to &quot;go&quot; each other &quot;one  story better&quot;; if they can belittle a neighbor in the process  it is clear gain, and so much advertisement.  Certain blocks  on lower Broadway are gems in this way!  Any one who has  glanced at an auctioneer&#x27;s shelves when a &quot;job lot&quot; of books  is being sold, will doubtless have noticed their resemblance  to the sidewalks of our down town streets.  Dainty little  duodecimo buildings are squeezed in between towering in- folios, and richly bound and tooled octavos chum with cheap  editions.  Our careless City Fathers have not even given  themselves the trouble of pushing their stone and brick  volumes into the same line, but allow them to straggle along  the shelf - I beg pardon, the sidewalk - according to their  own sweet will.</p>
<p>The resemblance of most new business buildings to flashy books  increases the more one studies them; they have the proportions  of school atlases, and, like them, are adorned only on their  backs (read fronts).  The modern builder, like the frugal  binder, leaves the sides of his creations unadorned, and  expends his ingenuity in decorating the narrow strip which he  naively imagines will be the only part seen, calmly ignoring  the fact that on glancing up or down a street the sides of  houses are what we see first.  It is almost impossible to get  mathematically opposite a building, yet that is the only point  from which these new constructions are not grotesque.</p>
<p>It seems as though the rudiments of common sense would suggest  that under existing circumstances the less decoration put on a  facade the greater would be the harmony of the whole.  But  trifles like harmony and fitness are splendidly ignored by the  architects of to-day, who, be it remarked in passing, have  slipped into another curious habit for which I should greatly  like to see an explanation offered.  As long as the ground  floors and the tops of their creations are elaborate, the  designer evidently thinks the intervening twelve or fifteen  stories can shift for themselves.  One clumsy mass on the  Bowling Green is an excellent example of this weakness.  Its  ground floor is a playful reproduction of the tombs of Egypt.   About the second story the architect must have become  discouraged - or perhaps the owner&#x27;s funds gave out - for the  next dozen floors are treated in the severest &quot;tenement house&quot;  manner; then, as his building terminates well up in the sky, a  top floor or two are, for no apparent reason, elaborately  adorned.  Indeed, this desire for a brilliant finish pervades  the neighborhood.  The Johnson Building on Broad Street (to  choose one out of the many) is sober and discreet in design  for a dozen stories, but bursts at its top into a Byzantine  colonnade.  Why? one asks in wonder.</p>
<p>Another new-comer, corner of Wall and Nassau Streets, is a  commonplace structure, with a fairly good cornice, on top of  which - an afterthought, probably - a miniature State Capitol  has been added, with dome and colonnade complete.  The result  recalls dear, absent-minded Miss Matty (in Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s  charming story), when she put her best cap on top of an old  one and sat smiling at her visitors from under the double  headdress!</p>
<p>Nowhere in the world - not even in Moscow, that city of domes  - can one see such a collection of pagodas, cupolas, kiosks,  and turrets as grace the roofs of our office buildings!   Architects evidently look upon such adornments as  compensations!  The more hideous the structure, the finer its  dome!  Having perpetrated a blot upon the city that cries to  heaven in its enormity, the repentant owner adds a pagoda or  two, much in the same spirit, doubtless, as prompts an Italian  peasant to hang a votive heart on some friendly shrine when a  crime lies heavy on his conscience.</p>
<p>What would be thought of a book-collector who took to standing  inkstands or pepperboxes on the tops of his tallest volumes by  way of adornment?  Yet domes on business buildings are every  bit as appropriate.  A choice collection of those  monstrosities graces Park Row, one much-gilded offender  varying the monotony by looking like a yellow stopper in a  high-shouldered bottle!  How modern architects with the  exquisite City Hall before them could have wandered so far  afield in their search for the original must always remain a  mystery.</p>
<p>When a tall, thin building happens to stand on a corner, the  likeness to an atlas is replaced by a grotesque resemblance to  a waffle iron, of which one structure just finished on Rector  Street skilfully reproduces&#x27; the lines.  The rows of little  windows were evidently arranged to imitate the indentations on  that humble utensil, and the elevated road at the back seems  in this case to do duty as the handle.  Mrs. Van Rensselaer  tells us in her delightful GOEDE VROUW OF MANA-HA-TA that  waffle irons used to be a favorite wedding present among the  Dutch settlers of this island, and were adorned with monograms  and other devices, so perhaps it is atavism that makes us so  fond of this form in building!  As, however, no careful  HAUSFRAU would have stood her iron on its edge, architects  should hesitate before placing their buildings in that  position, as the impression of instability is the same in each  case.</p>
<p>After leaving the vicinity of the City Hall, the tall slabs  that like magnified milestones mark the progress of  Architecture up Broadway become a shade less objectionable,  although one meets some strange freaks in so-called decoration  by the way.  Why, for instance, were those Titan columns  grouped around the entrance to the American Surety Company&#x27;s  building?  They do not support anything (the &quot;business&quot; of  columns in architecture) except some rather feeble statuary,  and do seriously block the entrance.  Were they added with the  idea of fitness?  That can hardly be, for a portico is as  inappropriate to such a building as it would be to a parlor  car, and almost as inconvenient.</p>
<p>Farther up town our attention is arrested by another misplaced  adornment.  What purpose can that tomb with a railing round it  serve on top of the New York Life Insurance building?  It  looks like a monument in Greenwood, surmounted by a rat-trap,  but no one is interred there, and vermin can hardly be  troublesome at that altitude.</p>
<p>How did this craze for decoration originate?  The inhabitants  of Florence and Athens did not consider it necessary.  There  must, I feel sure, be a reason for its use in this city;  American land-lords rarely spend money without a purpose;  perhaps they find that rococo detail draws business and  inspires confidence!</p>
<p>I should like to ask the architects of New York one question:  Have they not been taught that in their art, as in every  other, pretences are vulgar, that things should be what they  seem?  Then why do they continue to hide steel and fire-brick  cages under a veneer of granite six inches thick, causing them  to pose as solid stone buildings?  If there is a demand for  tall, light structures, why not build them simply (as bridges  are constructed), and not add a poultice of bogus columns and  zinc cornices that serve no purpose and deceive no one?</p>
<p>Union Square possesses blocks out of which the Jackson and  Decker buildings spring with a noble disregard of all rules  and a delicious incongruity that reminds one of Falstaff&#x27;s  corps of ill-drilled soldiers.  Madison Square, however, is  FACILE PRINCEPS, with its annex to the Hoffman House, a  building which would make the fortune of any dime museum that  could fence it in and show it for a fee!  Long contemplation  of this structure from my study window has printed every comic  detail on my brain.  It starts off at the ground level to be  an imitation of the Doge&#x27;s Palace (a neat and appropriate idea  in itself for a Broadway shop).  At the second story,  following the usual New York method, it reverts to a design  suggestive of a county jail (the Palace and the Prison), with  here and there a balcony hung out, emblematical, doubtless, of  the inmates&#x27; wash and bedding.  At the ninth floor the  repentant architect adds two more stories in memory of the  Doge&#x27;s residence.  Have you ever seen an accordion  (concertina, I believe, is the correct name) hanging in a shop  window?  The Twenty-fifth Street Doge&#x27;s Palace reminds me of  that humble instrument.  The wooden part, where the keys and  round holes are, stands on the sidewalk.  Then come an  indefinite number of pleats, and finally the other wooden end  well up among the clouds.  So striking is this resemblance  that at times one expects to hear the long-drawn moans  peculiar to the concertina issuing from those portals.  Alas!  even the most original designs have their drawbacks!  After  the proprietor of the Venetian accordion had got his  instrument well drawn out and balanced on its end, he  perceived that it dwarfed the adjacent buildings, so cast  about in his mind for a scheme to add height and dignity to  the rest of the block.  One day the astonished neighborhood  saw what appeared to be a &quot;roomy suburban villa&quot; of iron  rising on the roof of the old Hoffman House.  The results  suggests a small man who, being obliged to walk with a giant,  had put on a hat several times too large in order to equalize  their heights!</p>
<p>How astonished Pericles and his circle of architects and  sculptors would be could they stand on the corner of Broadway  and Twenty-eighth Street and see the miniature Parthenon that  graces the roof of a pile innocent of other Greek ornament?   They would also recognize their old friends, the ladies of the  Erechtheum, doing duty on the Reveillon Building across the  way, pretending to hold up a cornice, which, being in  proportion to the building, is several hundred times too big  for them to carry.  They can&#x27;t be seen from the sidewalk, -  the street is too narrow for that, - but such trifles don&#x27;t  deter builders from decorating when the fit is on them.   Perhaps this one got his caryatides at a bargain, and had to  work them in somewhere; so it is not fair to be hard on him.</p>
<p>If ever we take to ballooning, all these elaborate tops may  add materially to our pleasure.  At the present moment the  birds, and angels, it is to be hoped, appreciate the effort.   I, perhaps, of all the inhabitants of the city, have seen  those ladies face to face, when I have gone on a semi-monthly  visit to my roof to look for leaks!</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all very well to carp and cavil,&quot; many readers will say,  &quot;but `Idler&#x27; forgets that our modern architects have had to  contend with difficulties that the designers of other ages  never faced, demands for space and light forcing the  nineteenth-century builders to produce structures which they  know are neither graceful nor in proportion!&quot;</p>
<p>If my readers will give themselves the trouble to glance at  several office buildings in the city, they will realize that  the problem is not without a solution.  In almost every case  where the architect has refrained from useless decoration and  stuck to simple lines, the result, if not beautiful, has at  least been inoffensive.  It is where inappropriate elaboration  is added that taste is offended.  Such structures as the  Singer building, corner of Liberty Street and Broadway, and  the home of LIFE, in Thirty-first Street, prove that beauty  and grace of facade can be adapted to modern business wants.</p>
<p>Feeling as many New Yorkers do about this defacing of what  might have been the most beautiful of modern cities, it is  galling to be called upon to admire where it is already an  effort to tolerate.</p>
<p>A sprightly gentleman, writing recently in a scientific  weekly, goes into ecstasies of admiration over the advantages  and beauty of a steel mastodon on Park Row, a building that  has the proportions of a carpenter&#x27;s plane stood on end,  decorated here and there with balconies and a colonnade  perched on brackets up toward its fifteenth story.  He  complacently gives us its weight and height as compared with  the pyramids, and numerous other details as to floor space and  ventilation, and hints in conclusion that only old fogies and  dullards, unable to keep pace with the times, fail to  appreciate the charm of such structures in a city.  One of the  &quot;points&quot; this writer makes is the quality of air enjoyed by  tenants, amusingly oblivious of the fact that at least three  facades of each tall building will see the day only so long as  the proprietors of adjacent land are too poor or too busy to  construct similar colossi!</p>
<p>When all the buildings in a block are the same height, seven  eighths of the rooms in each will be without light or  ventilation.  It&#x27;s rather poor taste to brag of advantages  that are enjoyed only through the generosity of one&#x27;s  neighbors.</p>
<p>Business demands may force us to bow before the necessity of  these horrors, but it certainly is &quot;rubbing it in&quot; to ask our  applause.  When the Eiffel Tower was in course of  construction, the artists and literary lights of Paris raised  a tempest of protest.  One wonders why so little of the kind  has been done here.  It is perhaps rather late in the day to  suggest reform, yet if more New Yorkers would interest  themselves in the work, much might still be done to modify and  improve our metropolis.</p>
<p>One hears with satisfaction that a group of architects have  lately met and discussed plans for the embellishment of our  neglected city.  There is a certain poetical justice in the  proposition coming from those who have worked so much of the  harm.  Remorse has before now been known to produce good  results.  The United States treasury yearly receives large  sums of &quot;conscience money.&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 7 - Worldly Color-Blindness</p>
<p>MYRIADS of people have no ear for music and derive but little  pleasure from sweet sounds.  Strange as it may appear, many  gifted and sensitive mortals have been unable to distinguish  one note from another, Apollo&#x27;s harmonious art remaining for  them, as for the elder Dumas, only an &quot;expensive noise.&quot;</p>
<p>Another large class find it impossible to discriminate between  colors.  Men afflicted in this way have even become painters  of reputation.  I knew one of the latter, who, when a friend  complimented him on having caught the exact shade of a pink  toilet in one of his portraits, answered, &quot;Does that dress  look pink to you?  I thought it was green!&quot; and yet he had  copied what he saw correctly.</p>
<p>Both these classes are to be pitied, but are not the cause of  much suffering to others.  It is annoying, I grant you, to be  torn asunder in a collision, because red and green lights on  the switches combined into a pleasing harmony before the  brakeman&#x27;s eyes.  The tone-deaf gentleman who insists on  whistling a popular melody is almost as trying as the lady  suffering from the same weakness, who shouts, &quot;Ninon, Ninon,  que fais-tu de la vie!&quot; until you feel impelled to cry, &quot;Que  faites-vous, madame, with the key?&quot;</p>
<p>Examinations now keep daltonic gentlemen out of locomotives,  and ladies who have lost their &quot;keys&quot; are apt to find their  friends&#x27; pianos closed.  What we cannot guard against is a  variety of the genus HOMO which suffers from &quot;social color- blindness.&quot;  These well-meaning mortals form one of the  hardest trials that society is heir to; for the disease is  incurable, and as it is almost impossible to escape from them,  they continue to spread dismay and confusion along their path  to the bitter end.</p>
<p>This malady, which, as far as I know, has not been diagnosed,  invades all circles, and is, curiously enough, rampant among  well-born and apparently well-bred people.</p>
<p>Why is it that the entertainments at certain houses are always  dull failures, while across the way one enjoys such agreeable  evenings?  Both hosts are gentlemen, enjoying about the same  amount of &quot;unearned increment,&quot; yet the atmosphere of their  houses is radically different.  This contrast cannot be traced  to the dulness or brilliancy of the entertainer and his wife.   Neither can it be laid at the door of inexperience, for the  worst offenders are often old hands at the game.</p>
<p>The only explanation possible is that the owners of houses  where one is bored are socially color-blind, as cheerfully  unconscious of their weakness as the keyless lady and the  whistling abomination.</p>
<p>Since increasing wealth has made entertaining general and  lavish, this malady has become more and more apparent, until  one is tempted to parody Mme. Roland&#x27;s dying exclamation and  cry, &quot;Hospitality! hospitility! what crimes are committed in  thy name!&quot;</p>
<p>Entertaining is for many people but an excuse for ostentation.   For others it is a means to an end; while a third variety  apparently keep a debit and credit account with their  acquaintances - in books of double entry, so that no errors  may occur - and issue invitations like receipts, only in  return for value received.</p>
<p>We can rarely tell what is passing in the minds of people  about us.  Some of those mentioned above may feel a vague  pleasure when their rooms are filled with a chattering crowd  of more or less well-assorted guests; if that is denied them,  can find consolation for the outlay in an indefinite sensation  of having performed a duty, - what duty, or to whom, they  would, however, find it difficult to define.</p>
<p>Let the novice flee from the allurements of such a host.  Old  hands know him and have got him on their list, escaping when  escape is possible; for he will mate the green youth with the  red frump, or like a premature millennium force the lion and  the lamb to lie down together, and imagine he has given  unmixed pleasure to both.</p>
<p>One would expect that great worldly lights might learn by  experience how fatal bungled entertainments can be, but such  is not the case.  Many well-intentioned people continue  sacrificing their friends on the altar of hospitality year  after year with never a qualm of conscience or a sensation of  pity for their victims.  One practical lady of my acquaintance  asks her guests alphabetically, commencing the season and the  first leaf of her visiting list simultaneously and working  steadily on through both to &quot;finis.&quot;  If you are an A, you  will meet only A&#x27;s at her table, with perhaps one or two B&#x27;s  thrown in to fill up; you may sit next to your mother-in-law  for all the hostess cares.  She has probably never heard that  the number of guests at table should not exceed that of the  muses; or if by any chance she has heard it, does not care,  and considers such a rule old-fashioned and not appropriate to  our improved modern methods of entertaining.</p>
<p>One wonders what possible satisfaction a host can derive from  providing fifty people with unwholesome food and drink at a  fixed date.  It is a physical impossibility for him to have  more than a passing word with his guests, and ten to one the  unaccustomed number has upset the internal arrangements of his  household, so that the dinner will, in consequence, be poor  and the service defective.</p>
<p>A side-light on this question came to me recently when an  exceedingly frank husband confided to a circle of his friends  at the club the scheme his wife, who, though on pleasure bent,  was of a frugal mind, had adopted to balance her social  ledger.</p>
<p>&quot;As we dine out constantly through the year,&quot; remarked  Benedict, &quot;some return is necessary.  So we wait until the  height of the winter season, when everybody is engaged two  weeks in advance, then send out our invitations at rather  short notice for two or three consecutive dinners.  You&#x27;d be  surprised,&quot; he remarked, with a beaming smile, &quot;what a number  refuse; last winter we cancelled all our obligations with two  dinners, the flowers and entrees being as fresh on the second  evening as the first!  It&#x27;s wonderful!&quot; he remarked in  conclusion, &quot;how simple entertaining becomes when one knows  how!&quot;  Which reminded me of an ingenious youth I once heard  telling some friends how easy he had found it to write the  book he had just published.  After his departure we agreed  that if he found it so easy it would not be worth our while to  read his volume.</p>
<p>Tender-hearted people generally make bad hosts.  They have a  way of collecting the morally lame, halt, and blind into their  drawing-rooms that gives those apartments the air of a  convalescent home.  The moment a couple have placed themselves  beyond the social pale, these purblind hosts conceive an  affection for and lavish hospitality upon them.  If such a  host has been fortunate enough to get together a circle of  healthy people, you may feel confident that at the last moment  a leper will be introduced.  This class of entertainers fail  to see that society cannot he run on a philanthropic basis,  and so insist on turning their salons into hospitals.</p>
<p>It would take too long to enumerate the thousand  idiosyncrasies of the color-blind; few, however, are more  amusing than those of the impulsive gentlemen who invite  people to their homes indiscriminately, because they happen to  feel in a good humor or chance to be seated next them at  another house, - invitations which the host regrets half an  hour later, and would willingly recall.  &quot;I can&#x27;t think why I  asked the So-and-sos!&quot; he will confide to you.  &quot; I can&#x27;t  abide them; they are as dull as the dropsy!&quot;  Many years ago  in Paris, we used to call a certain hospitable lady&#x27;s  invitations &quot;soup tickets,&quot; so little individuality did they  possess.</p>
<p>The subtle laws of moral precedence are difficult reading for  the most intelligent, and therefore remain sealed books to the  afflicted mortals mentioned here.  The delicate tact that,  with no apparent effort, combines congenial elements into a  delightful whole is lacking in their composition.  The nice  discrimination that presides over some households is replaced  by a jovial indifference to other persons&#x27; feelings and  prejudices.</p>
<p>The idea of placing pretty Miss Debutante next young  Strongboys instead of giving her over into the clutches of old  Mr. Boremore will never enter these obtuse entertainers&#x27;  heads, any more than that of trying to keep poor, defenceless  Mrs. Mouse out of young Tom Cat&#x27;s claws.</p>
<p>It is useless to enumerate instances; people have suffered too  severely at the hands of careless and incompetent hosts not to  know pretty well what the title of this paper means.  So many  of us have come away from fruitless evenings, grinding our  teeth, and vowing never to enter those doors again while life  lasts, that the time seems ripe for a protest.</p>
<p>If the color-blind would only refrain from painting, and the  tone-deaf not insist on inviting one to their concerts, the  world would be a much more agreeable place.  If people would  only learn what they can and what they can&#x27;t do, and leave the  latter feats alone, a vast amount of unnecessary annoyance  would be avoided and the tiresome old grindstone turn to a  more cheerful tune.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 - Idling in Mid-Ocean</p>
<p>TO those fortunate mortals from whom Poseidon exacts no  tribute in crossing his broad domain, a transatlantic voyage  must afford each year an ever new delight.  The cares and  worries of existence fade away and disappear in company with  the land, in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.  One no  longer feels like the bored mortal who has all winter turned  the millstone of work and pleasure, but seems to have  transmigrated into a new body, endowed with a ravenous  appetite and perfectly fresh sensations.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is only the novelty of the surroundings; but as I  lie somnolent in my chair, tucked into a corner of the white  deck, watching the jade-colored water rush past below, and the  sea-gulls circle gayly overhead, the SUMMUM BONUM of earthly  contentment seems attained.  The book chosen with care remains  uncut; the sense of physical and mental rest is too exquisite  to be broken by any effort, even the reading of a favorite  author.</p>
<p>Drowsy lapses into unconsciousness obscure the senses, like  the transparent clouds that from time to time dim the  sunlight.  A distant bell in the wheel-house chimes the lazy  half-hours.  Groups of people come and go like figures on a  lantern-slide.  A curiously detached reeling makes the scene  and the actors in it as unreal as a painted ship manned by a  shadowy crew.  The inevitable child tumbles on its face and is  picked up shrieking by tender parents; energetic youths  organize games of skill or discover whales on the horizon,  without disturbing one&#x27;s philosophic calm.</p>
<p>I congratulate myself on having chosen a foreign line.  For a  week at least no familiar name will be spoken, no accustomed  face appear.  The galling harness of routine is loosened; one  breathes freely again conscious of the unoccupied hours in  perspective.</p>
<p>The welcome summons to luncheon comes as a pleasant shock.  Is  it possible that the morning has passed?  It seems to have but  commenced.  I rouse myself and descend to the cabin.  Toward  the end of the meal a rubicund Frenchman opposite makes the  startling proposition that if I wish to send a message home he  will undertake to have it delivered.  It is not until I notice  the little square of oiled paper he is holding out to me that  I understand this reference to the &quot;pigeon post&quot; with which  the Compagnie Transatlantique is experimenting.  At the  invitation of this new acquaintance I ascend to the upper deck  and watch his birds depart.</p>
<p>The tiny bits of paper on which we have written (post-card  fashion) message and address are rolled two or three together,  and inserted into a piece of quill less than two inches long,  which, however, they do not entirely fill.  While a pigeon is  held by one man, another pushes one of the bird&#x27;s tail- feathers well through the quill, which is then fastened in its  place by two minute wooden wedges.  A moment later the pigeon  is tossed up into the air, and we witness the working of that  mysterious instinct which all our modern science leaves  unexplained.  After a turn or two far up in the clear sky, the  bird gets its bearings and darts off on its five-hundred-mile  journey across unknown seas to an unseen land - a voyage that  no deviation or loitering will lengthen, and only fatigue or  accident interrupt, until he alights at his cote.</p>
<p>Five of these willing messengers were started the first day  out, and five more will leave to-morrow, poor little aerial  postmen, almost predestined to destruction (in the latter  case), for we shall then be so far from land that their one  chance of life and home must depend on finding some friendly  mast where an hour&#x27;s rest may be taken before the bird starts  again on his journey.</p>
<p>In two or three days, according to the weather, we shall begin  sending French pigeons on ahead of us toward Havre.  The  gentleman in charge of them tells me that his wife received  all the messages he sent to her during his westward trip, the  birds appearing each morning at her window (where she was in  the habit feeding them) with their tidings from mid-ocean.  He  also tells me that the French fleet in the Mediterranean  recently received messages from their comrades in the Baltic  on the third day by these feathered envoys.</p>
<p>It is hoped that in future ocean steamers will be able to keep  up communication with the land at least four out of the seven  days of their trips, so that, in case of delay or accident,  their exact position and circumstances can be made known at  headquarters.  It is a pity, the originator of the scheme  remarked, that sea-gulls are such hopeless vagabonds, for they  can fly much greater distances than pigeons, and are not  affected by dampness, which seriously cripples the present  messengers.</p>
<p>Later in the day a compatriot, inspired doubtless by the  morning&#x27;s experiment, confided to me that he had hit on &quot;a  great scheme,&quot; which he intends to develop on arriving.  His  idea is to domesticate families of porpoises at Havre and New  York, as that fish passes for having (like the pigeon) the  homing instinct.  Ships provided with the parent fish can free  one every twenty-four hours, charged with the morning&#x27;s mail.   The inventor of this luminous idea has already designed the  letter-boxes that are to be strapped on the fishes&#x27; backs, and  decided on a neat uniform for his postmen.</p>
<p>It is amusing during the first days &quot;out&quot; to watch the people  whom chance has thrown together into such close quarters.  The  occult power that impels a pigeon to seek its kind is feeble  in comparison with the faculty that travellers develop under  these circumstances for seeking out congenial spirits.  Twelve  hours do not pass before affinities draw together; what was  apparently a homogeneous mass has by that time grouped and  arranged itself into three or four distinct circles.</p>
<p>The &quot;sporty&quot; gentlemen in loud clothes have united in the  bonds of friendship with the travelling agents and have chosen  the smoking-room as their headquarters.  No mellow sunset or  serene moonlight will tempt these comrades from the subtleties  of poker; the pool on the run is the event of their day.</p>
<p>A portly prima donna is the centre of another circle.  Her  wraps, her dogs, her admirers, and her brand-new husband (a  handsome young Hungarian with a voice like two Bacian bulls)  fill the sitting-room, where the piano gets but little rest.   Neither sunshine nor soft winds can draw them to the deck.   Although too ill for the regular meals, this group eat and  drink during fifteen out of the twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The deck, however, is not deserted; two fashionable  dressmakers revel there.  These sociable ladies asked the  COMMISSAIRE at the start &quot;to introduce all the young unmarried  men to them,&quot; as they wanted to be jolly.  They have a  numerous court around them, and champagne, like the  conversation, flows freely.  These ladies have already become  expert at shuffleboard, but their &quot;sea legs&quot; are not so good  as might be expected, and the dames require to be caught and  supported by their admirers at each moment to prevent them  from tripping - an immense joke, to judge by the peals of  laughter that follow.</p>
<p>The American wife of a French ambassador sits on the captain&#x27;s  right.  A turn of the diplomatic wheel is taking the lady to  Madrid, where her position will call for supreme tact and  self-restraint.  One feels a thrill of national pride on  looking at her high-bred young face and listening as she chats  in French and Spanish, and wonders once more at the marvellous  faculty our women have of adapting themselves so graciously  and so naturally to difficult positions, which the women of  other nations rarely fill well unless born to the purple.  It  is the high opinion I have of my countrywomen that has made me  cavil, before now, on seeing them turned into elaborately  dressed nullities by foolish and too adoring husbands.</p>
<p>The voyage is wearing itself away.  Sunny days are succeeded  by gray mornings, as exquisite in their way, when one can feel  the ship fight against contending wind and wave, and shiver  under the blows received in a struggle which dashes the salt  spray high over the decks.  There is an aroma in the air then  that breathes new life into jaded nerves, and stirs the drop  of old Norse blood, dormant in most American veins, into  quivering ecstasy.  One dreams of throwing off the trammels of  civilized existence and returning to the free life of older  days.</p>
<p>But here is Havre glittering in the distance against her  background of chalk cliffs.  People come on deck in strangely  conventional clothes and with demure citified airs.   Passengers of whose existence you were unaware suddenly make  their appearance.  Two friends meet near me for the first  time.  &quot;Hallo, Jones!&quot; says one of them, &quot;are you crossing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answers Jones, &quot;are you?&quot;</p>
<p>The company&#x27;s tug has come alongside by this time, bringing  its budget of letters and telegrams.  The brief holiday is  over.  With a sigh one comes back to the positive and the  present, and patiently resumes the harness of life.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 - &quot;Climbers&quot; in England</p>
<p>THE expression &quot;Little Englander,&quot; much used of late to  designate an inhabitant of the Mother Isle in contra- distinction to other subjects of Her Majesty, expresses neatly  the feeling of our insular cousins not only as regards  ourselves, but also the position affected toward their  colonial brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that in every circle there is some  individual assuming to do things better than his comrades - to  know more, dress better, run faster, pronounce more correctly?   Who, unless promptly suppressed, will turn the conversation  into a monologue relating to his own exploits and opinions.   To differ is to bring down his contempt upon your devoted  head!  To argue is time wasted!</p>
<p>Human nature is, however, so constituted that a man of this  type mostly succeeds in hypnotizing his hearers into sharing  his estimate of himself, and impressing upon them the  conviction that he is a rare being instead of a commonplace  mortal.  He is not a bad sort of person at bottom, and ready  to do one a friendly turn - if it does not entail too great  inconvenience.  In short, a good fellow, whose principal  defect is the profound conviction that he was born superior to  the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>What this individual is to his environment, Englishmen are to  the world at large.  It is the misfortune, not the fault, of  the rest of the human race, that they are not native to his  island; a fact, by the way, which outsiders are rarely allowed  to lose sight of, as it entails a becoming modesty on their  part.</p>
<p>Few idiosyncrasies get more quickly on American nerves or are  further from our hearty attitude toward strangers.  As we are  far from looking upon wandering Englishmen with suspicion, it  takes us some time to realize that Americans who cut away from  their countrymen and settle far from home are regarded with  distrust and reluctantly received.  When a family of this kind  prepares to live in their neighborhood, Britons have a formula  of three questions they ask themselves concerning the new- comers: &quot;Whom do they know?  How much are they worth?&quot; and  &quot;What amusement (or profit) are we likely to get out of them?&quot;   If the answer to all or any of the three queries is  satisfactory, my lord makes the necessary advances and becomes  an agreeable, if not a witty or original, companion.</p>
<p>Given this and a number of other peculiarities, it seems  curious that a certain class of Americans should be so anxious  to live in England.  What is it tempts them?  It cannot be the  climate, for that is vile; nor the city of London, for it is  one of the ugliest in existence; nor their &quot;cuisine&quot; - for  although we are not good cooks ourselves, we know what good  food is and could give Britons points.  Neither can it be art,  nor the opera, - one finds both better at home or on the  Continent than in England.  So it must be society, and here  one&#x27;s wonder deepens!</p>
<p>When I hear friends just back from a stay over there enlarging  on the charms of &quot;country life,&quot; or a London &quot;season,&quot; I look  attentively to see if they are in earnest, so incomparably  dull have I always found English house parties or town  entertainments.  At least that side of society which the  climbing stranger mostly affects.  Other circles are charming,  if a bit slow, and the &quot;Bohemia&quot; and semi-Bohemia of London  have a delicate flavor of their own.</p>
<p>County society, that ideal life so attractive to American  readers of British novels, is, taken on the whole, the most  insipid existence conceivable.  The women lack the sparkle and  charm of ours; the men, who are out all day shooting or  hunting according to the season, get back so fagged that if  they do not actually drop asleep at the dinner-table, they  will nap immediately after, brightening only when the ladies  have retired, when, with evening dress changed for comfortable  smoking suits, the hunters congregate in the billiard-room for  cigars and brandy and seltzer.</p>
<p>A particularly agreeable American woman, whose husband insists  on going every winter to Melton-Mowbray for the hunting, was  describing the other day the life there among the women, and  expressing her wonder that those who did not hunt could  refrain from blowing out their brains, so awful was the  dulness and monotony!  She had ended by not dining out at all,  having discovered that the conversation never by any chance  deviated far from the knees of the horses and the height of  the hedges!</p>
<p>Which reminds one of Thackeray relating how he had longed to  know what women talked about when they were alone after  dinner, imagining it to be on mysterious and thrilling  subjects, until one evening he overheard such a conversation  and found it turned entirely on children and ailments!  As  regards wit, the English are like the Oriental potentate who  at a ball in Europe expressed his astonishment that the guests  took the trouble to dance and get themselves hot and  dishevelled, explaining that in the East he paid people to do  that for him.  In England &quot;amusers&quot; are invited expressly to  be funny; anything uttered by one of these delightful  individuals is sure to be received with much laughter.  It is  so simple that way!  One is prepared and knows when to laugh.   Whereas amateur wit is confusing.  When an American I knew,  turning over the books on a drawing-room table and finding  Hare&#x27;s WALKS IN LONDON, in two volumes, said, &quot;So you part  your hair in the middle over here,&quot; the remark was received in  silence, and with looks of polite surprise.</p>
<p>It is not necessary, however, to accumulate proofs that this  much described society is less intelligent than our own.   Their authors have acknowledged it, and well they may.  For  from Scott and Dickens down to Hall Caine, American  appreciation has gone far toward establishing the reputation  of English writers at home.</p>
<p>In spite of lack of humor and a thousand other defects which  ought to make English swelldom antagonistic to our countrymen,  the fact remains that &quot;smart&quot; London tempts a certain number  of Americans and has become a promised land, toward which they  turn longing eyes.  You will always find a few of these  votaries over there in the &quot;season,&quot; struggling bravely up the  social current, making acquaintances, spending money at  charity sales, giving dinners and fetes, taking houses at  Ascot and filling them with their new friends&#x27; friends.  With  more or less success as the new-comers have been able to  return satisfactory answers to the three primary questions.</p>
<p>What Americans are these, who force us to blush for them  infinitely more than for the unlettered tourists trotting  conscientiously around the country, doing the sights and  asking for soda-water and buckwheat cakes at the hotels!</p>
<p>Any one who has been an observer of the genus &quot;Climber&quot; at  home, and wondered at their way and courage, will recognize  these ambitious souls abroad; five minutes&#x27; conversation is  enough.  It is never about a place that they talk, but of the  people they know.  London to them is not the city of Dickens.   It is a place where one may meet the Prince of Wales and  perhaps obtain an entrance into his set.</p>
<p>One description will cover most climbers.  They are, as a  rule, people who start humbly in some small city, then when  fortune comes, push on to New York and Newport, where they  carry all before them and make their houses centres and  themselves powers.  Next comes the discovery that the circle  into which they have forced their way is not nearly as  attractive as it appeared from a distance.  Consequently that  vague disappointment is felt which most of us experience on  attaining a long desired goal - the unsatisfactoriness of  success!  Much the same sensation as caused poor Du Maurier to  answer, when asked shortly before his death why he looked so  glum, &quot;I&#x27;m soured by success!&quot;</p>
<p>So true is this of all human nature that the following recipe  might be given for the attainment of perfect happiness: &quot;Begin  far down in any walk of life.  Rise by your efforts higher  each year, and then be careful to die before discovering that  there is nothing at the top.  The excitement of the struggle -  `the rapture of the chase&#x27; - are greater joys than  achievement.&quot;</p>
<p>Our ambitious friends naturally ignore this bit of philosophy.   When it is discovered that the &quot;world&quot; at home has given but  an unsatisfactory return for cash and conniving, it occurs to  them that the fault lies in the circle, and they assume that  their particular talents require a larger field.  Having  conquered all in sight, these social Alexanders pine for a new  world, which generally turns out to be the &quot;Old,&quot; so a  crossing is made, and the &quot;Conquest of England&quot; begun with all  the enthusiasm and push employed on starting out from the  little native city twenty years before.</p>
<p>It is in Victoria&#x27;s realm that foemen worthy of their steel  await the conquerors.  Home society was a too easy prey,  opening its doors and laying down its arms at the first  summons.  In England the new-comers find that their little  game has been played before; and, well, what they imagined was  a discovery proves to be a long-studied science with &quot;DONNANT!  DONNANT!&quot; as its fundamental law.  Wily opponents with trump  cards in their hands and a profound knowledge of &quot;Hoyle&quot;  smilingly offer them seats.  Having acquired in a home game a  knowledge of &quot;bluff,&quot; our friends plunge with delight into the  fray, only to find English society so formed that, climb they  never so wisely, the top can never be reached.  Work as hard  as they may, succeed even beyond their fondest hopes, there  will always remain circles above, toward which to yearn -  people who will refuse to know them, houses they will never be  invited to enter.  Think of the charm, the attraction such a  civilization must have for the real born climber, and you, my  reader, will understand why certain of our compatriots enjoy  living in England, and why when once the intoxicating draught  (supplied to the ambitious on the other side) has been tasted,  all home concoctions prove insipid.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 - CALVE at Cabrieres</p>
<p>WHILE I was making a &quot;cure&quot; last year at Lamalou, an obscure  Spa in the Cevennes Mountains, Madame Calve, to whom I had  expressed a desire to see her picturesque home, telegraphed an  invitation to pass the day with her, naming the train she  could meet, which would allow for the long drive to her  chateau before luncheon.  It is needless to say the invitation  was accepted.  As my train drew up at the little station,  Madame Calve, in her trap, was the first person I saw, and no  time was lost in getting EN ROUTE.</p>
<p>During the hour passed on the poplar-bordered road that leads  straight and white across the country I had time to appreciate  the transformation in the woman at my side.  Was this gray- clad, nunlike figure the passionate, sensuous Carmen of  Bizet&#x27;s masterpiece?  Could that calm, pale face, crossed by  innumerable lines of suffering, as a spider&#x27;s web lies on a  flower, blaze and pant with Sappho&#x27;s guilty love?</p>
<p>Something of these thoughts must have appeared on my face, for  turning with a smile, she asked, &quot;You find me changed?  It&#x27;s  the air of my village.  Here I&#x27;m myself.  Everywhere else I&#x27;m  different.  On the stage I am any part I may be playing, but  am never really happy away from my hill there.&quot;  As she spoke,  a sun-baked hamlet came in sight, huddled around the base of  two tall towers that rose cool and gray in the noonday heat.</p>
<p>&quot;All that wing,&quot; she added, &quot;is arranged for the convalescent  girls whom I have sent down to me from the Paris hospitals for  a cure of fresh air and simple food.  Six years ago, just  after I had bought this place, a series of operations became  necessary which left me prostrated and anaemic.  No tonics  were of benefit.  I grew weaker day by day, until the doctors  began to despair of my life.  Finally, at the advice of an old  woman here who passes for being something of a curer, I tried  the experiment or lying five or six hours a day motionless in  the sunlight.  It wasn&#x27;t long before I felt life creeping back  to my poor feeble body.  The hot sun of our magic south was a  more subtle tonic than any drug.  When the cure was complete,  I made up my mind that each summer the same chance should be  offered to as many of my suffering sisters as this old place  could be made to accommodate.&quot;</p>
<p>The bells on the shaggy Tarbes ponies she was driving along  the Languedoc road drew, on nearing her residence, a number of  peasant children from their play.</p>
<p>As the ruddy urchins ran shouting around our carriage wheels  and scrambled in the dust for the sous we threw them, my  hostess pointed laughing to a scrubby little girl with tomato- colored cheeks and tousled dark hair, remarking, &quot;I looked  like that twenty years ago and performed just those antics on  this very road.  No punishment would keep me off the highway.   Those pennies, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, will all be spent at the  village pastry cook&#x27;s within an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>This was said with such a tender glance at the children that  one realized the great artist was at home here, surrounded by  the people she loved and understood.  True to the &quot;homing&quot;  instinct of the French peasant, Madame Calve, when fortune  came to her, bought and partially restored the rambling  chateau which at sunset casts its shadow across the village of  her birth.  Since that day every moment of freedom from  professional labor and every penny of her large income are  spent at Cabrieres, building, planning, even farming, when her  health permits.</p>
<p>&quot;I think,&quot; she continued, as we approached the chateau, &quot;that  the happiest day of my life - and I have, as you know, passed  some hours worth living, both on and off the stage - was when,  that wing completed, a Paris train brought the first occupants  for my twenty little bedrooms; no words can tell the delight  it gives me now to see the color coming back to my patients&#x27;  pale lips and hear them laughing and singing about the place.   As I am always short of funds, the idea of abandoning this  work is the only fear the future holds for me.&quot;</p>
<p>With the vivacity peculiar to her character, my companion then  whipped up her cobs and turned the conversation into gayer  channels.  Five minutes later we clattered over a drawbridge  and drew up in a roomy courtyard, half blinding sunlight and  half blue shadow, where a score of girls were occupied with  books and sewing.</p>
<p>The luncheon bell was ringing as we ascended the terrace  steps.  After a hurried five minutes for brushing and washing,  we took our places at a long table set in the cool stone hall,  guests stopping in the chateau occupying one end around the  chatelaine, the convalescents filling the other seats.</p>
<p>Those who have only seen the capricious diva on the stage or  in Parisian salons can form little idea of the proprietress of  Cabrieres.  No shade of coquetry blurs the clear picture of  her home life.  The capped and saboted peasant women who  waited on us were not more simple in their ways.  Several  times during the meal she left her seat to inquire after the  comfort of some invalid girl or inspect the cooking in the  adjacent kitchen.  These wanderings were not, however, allowed  to disturb the conversation, which flowed on after the mellow  French fashion, enlivened by much wit and gay badinage.  One  of our hostess&#x27;s anecdotes at her own expense was especially  amusing.</p>
<p>&quot;When in Venice,&quot; she told us, &quot;most prima donnas are carried  to and from the opera in sedan chairs to avoid the risk of  colds from the draughty gondolas.  The last night of my  initial season there, I was informed, as the curtain fell,  that a number of Venetian nobles were planning to carry me in  triumph to the hotel.  When I descended from my dressing-room  the courtyard of the theatre was filled with men in dress  clothes, bearing lanterns, who caught up the chair as soon as  I was seated and carried it noisily across the city to the  hotel.  Much moved by this unusual honor, I mounted to the  balcony of my room, from which elevation I bowed my thanks,  and threw all the flowers at hand to my escort.</p>
<p>&quot;Next morning the hotel proprietor appeared with my coffee,  and after hesitating a moment, remarked: <code>Well, we made a  success of it last night.  It has been telegraphed to all the  capitals of Europe!  I hope you will not think a thousand  francs too much, considering the advertisement!&#x27;  In blank  amazement, I asked what he meant.  </code>I mean the triumphal  progress,&#x27; he answered.  `I thought you understood!  We always  organize one for the &quot;stars&quot; who visit Venice.  The men who  carried your chair last night were the waiters from the  hotels.  We hire them on account of their dress clothes&#x27;!   Think of the disillusion,&quot; added Calve, laughing, &quot;and my  disgust, when I thought of myself naively throwing kisses and  flowers to a group of Swiss garcons at fifteen francs a head.   There was nothing to do, however, but pay the bill and swallow  my chagrin!&quot;</p>
<p>How many pretty women do you suppose would tell such a joke  upon themselves?  Another story she told us is characteristic  of her peasant neighbors.</p>
<p>&quot;When I came back here after my first season in St. Petersburg  and London the CURE requested me to sing at our local fete.  I  gladly consented, and, standing by his side on the steps of  the MAIRIE, gave the great aria from the HUGUENOTS in my best  manner.  To my astonishment the performance was received in  complete silence.  <code>Poor Calve,&#x27; I heard an old friend of my  mother&#x27;s murmur.  </code>Her voice used to be so nice, and now it&#x27;s  all gone!&#x27;  Taking in the situation at a glance, I threw my  voice well up into my nose and started off on a well-known  provincial song, in the shrill falsetto of our peasant women.   The effect was instantaneous!  Long before the end the  performance was drowned in thunders of applause.  Which proves  that to be popular a singer must adapt herself to her  audience.&quot;</p>
<p>Luncheon over, we repaired for cigarettes and coffee to an  upper room, where Calve was giving Dagnan-Bouveret some  sittings for a portrait, and lingered there until four  o&#x27;clock, when our hostess left us for her siesta, and a  &quot;break&quot; took those who cared for the excursion across the  valley to inspect the ruins of a Roman bath.  A late dinner  brought us together again in a small dining room, the  convalescents having eaten their simple meal and disappeared  an hour before.  During this time, another transformation had  taken place in our mercurial hostess!  It was the Calve of  Paris, Calve the witch, Calve the CAPITEUSE, who presided at  the dainty, flower-decked table and led the laughing  conversation.</p>
<p>A few notes struck on a guitar by one of the party, as we sat  an hour later on the moonlit terrace, were enough to start off  the versatile artist, who was in her gayest humor.  She sang  us stray bits of opera, alternating her music with scenes  burlesqued from recent plays.  No one escaped her inimitable  mimicry, not even the &quot;divine Sarah,&quot; Calve giving us an  unpayable impersonation of the elderly TRAGEDIENNE as  Lorenzaccio, the boy hero of Alfred de Musset&#x27;s drama.   Burlesquing led to her dancing some Spanish steps with an  abandon never attempted on the stage!  Which in turn gave  place to an imitation of an American whistling an air from  CARMEN, and some &quot;coon songs&quot; she had picked up during her  stay at New York.  They, again, were succeeded by a superb  rendering of the imprecation from Racine&#x27;s CAMILLE, which made  her audience realize that in gaining a soprano the world has  lost, perhaps, its greatest TRAGEDIENNE.</p>
<p>At eleven o&#x27;clock the clatter of hoofs in the court warned us  that the pleasant evening had come to an end.  A journalist EN  ROUTE for Paris was soon installed with me in the little  omnibus that was to take us to the station, Calve herself  lighting our cigars and providing the wraps that were to keep  out the cool night air.</p>
<p>As we passed under the low archway of the entrance amid a  clamor of &quot;adieu&quot; and &quot;au revoir,&quot; the young Frenchman at my  side pointed up to a row of closed windows overhead.  &quot;Isn&#x27;t  it a lesson,&quot; he said, &quot;for all of us, to think of the  occupants of those little rooms, whom the generosity and care  of that gracious artist are leaning by such pleasant paths  back to health and courage for their toilsome lives?&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 11 - A Cry For Fresh Air</p>
<p>&quot;ONCE upon a time,&quot; reads the familiar nursery tale, while the  fairies, invited by a king and queen to the christening of  their daughter, were showering good gifts on the baby  princess, a disgruntled old witch, whom no one had thought of  asking to the ceremony, appeared uninvited on the scene and  revenged herself by decreeing that the presents of the good  fairies, instead of proving beneficial, should bring only  trouble and embarrassment to the royal infant.</p>
<p>A telling analogy might be drawn between that unhappy princess  over whose fate so many youthful tears have been shed, and the  condition of our invention-ridden country; for we see every  day how the good gifts of those nineteenth century fairies,  Science and Industry, instead of proving blessings to mankind,  are being turned by ignorance and stupidity into veritable  afflictions.</p>
<p>If a prophetic gentleman had told Louis Fourteenth&#x27;s shivering  courtiers - whom an iron etiquette forced on winter mornings  into the (appropriately named) Galerie des Glaces, stamping  their silk-clad feet and blowing on their blue fingers, until  the king should appear - that within a century and a half one  simple discovery would enable all classes of people to keep  their shops and dwellings at a summer temperature through the  severest winters, the half-frozen nobles would have flouted  the suggestion as an &quot;iridescent dream,&quot; a sort of too-good- to-be-true prophecy.</p>
<p>What was to those noblemen an unheard-of luxury has become  within the last decade one of the primary necessities of our  life.</p>
<p>The question arises now: Are we gainers by the change?  Has  the indiscriminate use of heat been of advantage, either  mentally or physically, to the nation?</p>
<p>The incubus of caloric that sits on our gasping country is  particularly painful at this season, when nature undertakes to  do her own heating.</p>
<p>In other less-favored lands, the first spring days, the  exquisite awakening of the world after a long winter, bring to  the inhabitants a sensation of joy and renewed vitality.  We,  however, have discounted that enjoyment.  Delicate gradations  of temperature are lost on people who have been stewing for  six months in a mixture of steam and twice-breathed air.</p>
<p>What pleasure can an early April day afford the man who has  slept in an over-heated flat and is hurrying to an office  where eighty degrees is the average all the year round?  Or  the pale shop-girl, who complains if a breath of morning air  strays into the suburban train where she is seated?</p>
<p>As people who habitually use such &quot;relishes&quot; as Chutney and  Worcestershire are incapable of appreciating delicately  prepared food, so the &quot;soft&quot; mortals who have accustomed  themselves to a perpetual August are insensible to fine  shadings of temperature.</p>
<p>The other day I went with a friend to inspect some rooms he  had been decorating in one of our public schools.  The morning  had been frosty, but by eleven o&#x27;clock the sun warmed the air  uncomfortably.  On entering the school we were met by a blast  of heated air that was positively staggering.  In the  recitation rooms, where, as in all New York schoolrooms, the  children were packed like dominoes in a box, the temperature  could not have been under eighty-five.</p>
<p>The pale, spectacled spinster in charge, to whom we complained  of this, was astonished and offended at what she considered  our interference, and answered that &quot;the children liked it  warm,&quot; as for herself she &quot;had a cold and could not think of  opening a window.&quot;  If the rooms were too warm it was the  janitor&#x27;s fault, and he had gone out!</p>
<p>Twelve o&#x27;clock struck before we had finished our tour of  inspection.  It is to be doubted if anywhere else in the world  could there be found such a procession of pasty-faced, dull- eyed youngsters as trooped past us down the stairs.  Their  appearance was the natural result of compelling children  dressed for winter weather to sit many hours each day in  hothouses, more suited to tropical plants than to growing  human beings.</p>
<p>A gentleman with us remarked with a sigh, &quot;I have been in  almost every school in the city and find the same condition  everywhere.  It is terrible, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any  remedy for it.&quot;  The taste for living in a red-hot atmosphere  is growing on our people; even public vehicles have to be  heated now to please the patrons.</p>
<p>When tiresome old Benjamin Franklin made stoves popular he  struck a terrible blow at the health of his compatriots; the  introduction of steam heat and consequent suppression of all  health-giving ventilation did the rest; the rosy cheeks of  American children went up the chimney with the last whiff of  wood smoke, and have never returned.  Much of our home life  followed; no family can be expected to gather in cheerful  converse around a &quot;radiator.&quot;</p>
<p>How can this horror of fresh air among us be explained?  If  people really enjoy living in overheated rooms with little or  no ventilation, why is it that we hear so much complaining,  when during the summer months the thermometer runs up into the  familiar nineties?  Why are children hurried out of town, and  why do wives consider it a necessity to desert their husbands?</p>
<p>It&#x27;s rather inconsistent, to say the least, for not one of  those deserters but would &quot;kick&quot; if the theatre or church they  attend fell below that temperature in December.</p>
<p>It is impossible to go into our banks and offices and not  realize that the air has been breathed again and again, heated  and cooled, but never changed, - doors and windows fit too  tightly for that.</p>
<p>The pallor and dazed expression of the employees tell the same  tale.  I spoke to a youth the other day in an office about his  appearance and asked if he was ill.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, &quot;I  have had a succession of colds all winter.  You see, my desk  here is next to the radiator, so I am in a perpetual  perspiration and catch cold as soon as I go out.  Last winter  I passed three months in a farmhouse, where the water froze in  my room at night, and we had to wear overcoats to our meals.   Yet I never had a cold there, and gained in weight and  strength.&quot;</p>
<p>Twenty years ago no &quot;palatial private residence&quot; was  considered complete unless there was a stationary washstand  (forming a direct connection with the sewer) in each bedroom.   We looked pityingly on foreigners who did not enjoy these  advantages, until one day we realized that the latter were in  the right, and straightway stationary washstands disappeared.</p>
<p>How much time must pass and how many victims be sacrificed  before we come to our senses on the great radiator question?</p>
<p>As a result of our population living in a furnace, it happens  now that when you rebel on being forced to take an impromptu  Turkish bath at a theatre, the usher answers your complaint  with &quot;It can&#x27;t be as warm as you think, for a lady over there  has just told me she felt chilly and asked for more heat!&quot;</p>
<p>Another invention of the enemy is the &quot;revolving door.&quot;  By  this ingenious contrivance the little fresh air that formerly  crept into a building is now excluded.  Which explains why on  entering our larger hotels one is taken by the throat, as it  were, by a sickening long-dead atmosphere - in which the  souvenir of past meals and decaying flowers floats like a  regret - such as explorers must find on opening an Egyptian  tomb.</p>
<p>Absurd as it may seem, it has become a distinction to have  cool rooms.  Alas, they are rare!  Those blessed households  where one has the delicious sensation of being chilly and can  turn with pleasure toward crackling wood!  The open fire has  become, within the last decade, a test of refinement, almost a  question of good breeding, forming a broad distinction between  dainty households and vulgar ones, and marking the line which  separates the homes of cultivated people from the parlors of  those who care only for display.</p>
<p>A drawing-room filled with heat, the source of which remains  invisible, is as characteristic of the parvenu as clanking  chains on a harness or fine clothes worn in the street.</p>
<p>An open fire is the &quot;eye&quot; of a room, which can no more be  attractive without it than the human face can be beautiful if  it lacks the visual organs.  The &quot;gas fire&quot; bears about the  same relation to the real thing as a glass eye does to a  natural one, and produces much the same sensation.  Artificial  eyes are painful necessities in some cases, and therefore  cannot be condemned; but the household which gathers  complacently around a &quot;gas log&quot; must have something radically  wrong with it, and would be capable of worse offences against  taste and hospitality.</p>
<p>There is a tombstone in a New England grave-yard the  inscription on which reads: &quot;I was well, I wanted to be  better.  Here I am.&quot;</p>
<p>As regards heating of our houses, it&#x27;s to be feared that we  have gone much the same road as the unfortunate New Englander.   I don&#x27;t mean to imply that he is now suffering from too much  heat, but we, as a nation, certainly are.</p>
<p>Janitors and parlor-car conductors have replaced the wicked  fairies of other days, but are apparently animated by their  malignant spirit, and employ their hours of brief authority as  cruelly.  No witch dancing around her boiling cauldron was  ever more joyful than the fireman of a modern hotel, as he  gleefully turns more and more steam upon his helpless victims.   Long acquaintance with that gentleman has convinced me that he  cannot plead ignorance as an excuse for falling into these  excesses.  It is pure, unadulterated perversity, else why  should he invariably choose the mildest mornings to show what  his engines can do?</p>
<p>Many explanations have been offered for this love of a high  temperature by our compatriots.  Perhaps the true one has not  yet been found.  Is it not possible that what appears to be  folly and almost criminal negligence of the rules of health,  may be, after all, only a commendable ambition to renew the  exploits of those biblical heroes, Shadrach, Meshach, and  Abednego?</p>
<p>Chapter 12 - The Paris of our Grandparents</p>
<p>WE are apt to fall into the error of assuming that only  American cities have displaced their centres and changed their  appearance during the last half-century.</p>
<p>The &quot;oldest inhabitant,&quot; with his twice-told tales of  transformations and changes, is to a certain extent  responsible for this; by contrast, we imagine that the  capitals of Europe have always been just as we see them.  So  strong is this impression that it requires a serious effort of  the imagination to reconstruct the Paris that our grandparents  knew and admired, few as the years are that separate their day  from ours.</p>
<p>It is, for instance, difficult to conceive of a Paris that  ended at the rue Royale, with only waste land and market  gardens beyond the Madeleine, where to-day so many avenues  open their stately perspectives; yet such was the case!  The  few fine residences that existed beyond that point faced the  Faubourg Saint-Honore, with gardens running back to an unkempt  open country called the Champs Elysees, where an unfinished  Arc de Triomphe stood alone in a wilderness that no one ever  dreamed of traversing.</p>
<p>The fashionable ladies of that time drove in the afternoon  along the boulevards from the Madeleine to the Chateau d&#x27;Eau,  and stopped their ponderous yellow barouches at Tortoni&#x27;s,  where ices were served to them in their carriages, while they  chatted with immaculate dandies in skin-tight nankeen  unmentionables, blue swallow-tailed coats, and furry `beaver&quot;  hats.</p>
<p>While looking over some books in the company of an old lady  who from time to time opens her store of treasures and recalls  her remote youth at my request, and whose SPIRITUEL and  graphic language gives to her souvenirs the air of being stray  chapters from some old-fashioned romance, I received a vivid  impression of how the French capital must have looked fifty  years ago.</p>
<p>Emptying in her company a chest of books that had not seen the  light for several decades, we came across a &quot;Panorama of the  Boulevards,&quot; dated 1845, which proved when unfolded to be a  colored lithograph, a couple of yards long by five or six  inches high, representing the line of boulevards from the  Madeleine to the Place de la Bastille.  Each house, almost  each tree, was faithfully depicted, together with the crowds  on the sidewalks and the carriages in the street.  The whole  scene was as different from the effect made by that  thoroughfare to-day as though five hundred and not fifty years  had elapsed since the little book was printed.  The picture  breathed an atmosphere of calm and nameless quaintness that  one finds now only in old provincial cities which have escaped  the ravages of improvement.</p>
<p>My companion sat with the book unfolded before her, in a  smiling trance.  Her mind had turned back to the far-away days  when she first trod those streets a bride, with all the  pleasures and few of the cares of life to think about.</p>
<p>I watched her in silence (it seemed a sacrilege to break in on  such a train of thought), until gradually her eyes lost their  far-away expression, and, turning to me with a smile, she  exclaimed: &quot;How we ever had the courage to appear in the  street dressed as we were is a mystery!  Do you see that  carriage?&quot; pointing in the print to a high-swung family  vehicle with a powdered coachman on the box, and two sky-blue  lackeys standing behind.  &quot;I can remember, as if it were  yesterday, going to drive with Lady B-, the British  ambassadress, in just such a conveyance.  She drove four  horses with feathers on their heads, when she used to come to  Meurice&#x27;s for me.  I blush when I think that my frock was so  scant that I had to raise the skirt almost to my knees in  order to get into her carriage.</p>
<p>&quot;Why we didn&#x27;t all die of pneumonia is another marvel, for we  wore low-necked dresses and the thinnest of slippers in the  street, our heads being about the only part that was  completely covered.  I was particularly proud of a turban  surmounted with a bird of paradise, but Lady B- affected poke  bonnets, then just coming into fashion, so large and so deep  that when one looked at her from the side nothing was visible  except two curls, `as damp and as black as leeches.&#x27;  In other  ways our toilets were absurdly unsuited for every-day wear; we  wore light scarves over our necks, and rarely used furlined  pelisses.&quot;</p>
<p>Returning to an examination of the panorama, my companion  pointed out to me that there was no break in the boulevards,  where the opera-house, with its seven radiating avenues, now  stands, but a long line of Hotels, dozing behind high walls,  and quaint two-storied buildings that undoubtedly dated from  the razing of the city wall and the opening of the new  thoroughfare under Louis XV.</p>
<p>A little farther on was the world-famous Maison Doree, where  one almost expected to see Alfred de Musset and le docteur  Veron dining with Dumas and Eugene Sue.</p>
<p>&quot;What in the name of goodness is that?&quot; I exclaimed, pointing  to a couple of black and yellow monstrosities on wheels, which  looked like three carriages joined together with a &quot;buggy&quot;  added on in front.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the diligence just arrived from Calais; it has been  two days EN ROUTE, the passengers sleeping as best they could,  side by side, and escaping from their confinement only when  horses were changed or while stopping for meals.  That high  two-wheeled trap with the little <code>tiger&#x27; standing up behind is  a tilbury.  We used to see the Count d&#x27;Orsay driving one like  that almost every day.  He wore butter-colored gloves, and the  skirts of his coat were pleated full all around, and stood out  like a ballet girl&#x27;s.  It is a pity they have not included  Louis Philippe and his family jogging off to Neuilly in the  court </code>carryall,&#x27; - the `Citizen King,&#x27; with his blue umbrella  between his knees, trying to look like an honest bourgeois,  and failing even in that attempt to please the Parisians.</p>
<p>&quot;We were in Paris in &#x27;48; from my window at Meurice&#x27;s I saw  poor old JUSTE MILIEU read his abdication from the historic  middle balcony of the Tuileries, and half an hour later we  perceived the Duchesse d&#x27;Orleans leave the Tuileries on foot,  leading her two sons by the hand, and walk through the gardens  and across the Place de la Concorde to the Corps Legislatif,  in a last attempt to save the crown for her son.  Futile  effort!  That evening the `Citizen King&#x27; was hurried through  those same gardens and into a passing cab, EN ROUTE for a life  exile.</p>
<p>&quot;Our balcony at Meurice&#x27;s was a fine point of observation from  which to watch a revolution.  With an opera-glass we could see  the mob surging to the sack of the palace, the priceless  furniture and bric-a-brac flung into the street, court dresses  waved on pikes from the tall windows, and finally the throne  brought out, and carried off to be burned.  There was no  keeping the men of our party in after that.  They rushed off  to have a nearer glimpse of the fighting, and we saw no more  of them until daybreak the following morning when, just as we  were preparing to send for the police, two dilapidated,  ragged, black-faced mortals appeared, in whom we barely  recognized our husbands.  They had been impressed into service  and passed their night building barricades.  My better half,  however, had succeeded in snatching a handful of the gold  fringe from the throne as it was carried by, an act of prowess  that repaid him for all his troubles and fatigue.</p>
<p>&quot;I passed the greater part of forty-eight hours on our  balcony, watching the mob marching by, singing LA  MARSEILLAISE, and camping at night in the streets.  It was all  I could do to tear myself away from the window long enough to  eat and write in my journal.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no Avenue de l&#x27;Opera then.  The trip from the  boulevards to the Palais-Royal had to be made by a long detour  across the Place Vendome (where, by the bye, a cattle market  was held) or through a labyrinth of narrow, bad-smelling  little streets, where strangers easily lost their way.  Next  to the boulevards, the Palais-Royal was the centre of the  elegant and dissipated life in the capital.  It was there we  met of an afternoon to drink chocolate at the <code>Rotonde,&#x27; or to  dine at </code>Les Trois Freres Provencaux,&#x27; and let our husbands  have a try at the gambling tables in the Passage d&#x27;Orleans.</p>
<p>&quot;No one thought of buying jewelry anywhere else.  It was from  the windows of its shops that the fashions started on their  way around the world.  When Victoria as a bride was visiting  Louis Philippe, she was so fascinated by the aspect of the  place that the gallant French king ordered a miniature copy of  the scene, made IN PAPIER-MACHE, as a present for his guest, a  sort of gigantic dolls&#x27; house in which not only the palace and  its long colonnades were reproduced, but every tiny shop and  the myriad articles for sale were copied with Chinese  fidelity.  Unfortunately the pear-headed old king became  England&#x27;s uninvited guest before this clumsy toy was finished,  so it never crossed the Channel, but can be seen to-day by any  one curious enough to examine it, in the Musee Carnavalet.</p>
<p>&quot;Few of us realize that the Paris of Charles X. and Louis  Philippe would seem to us now a small, ill-paved, and worse- lighted provincial town, with few theatres or hotels,  communicating with the outer world only by means of a horse- drawn `post,&#x27; and practically farther from London than  Constantinople is to-day.  One feels this isolation in the  literature of the time; brilliant as the epoch was, the  horizon of its writers was bounded by the boulevards and the  Faubourg Saint-Germain.&quot;</p>
<p>Dumas says laughingly, in a letter to a friend: &quot;I have never  ventured into the unexplored country beyond the Bastille, but  am convinced that it shelters wild animals and savages.&quot;  The  wit and brains of the period were concentrated into a small  space.  Money-making had no more part in the programme of a  writer then than an introduction into &quot;society.&quot;  Catering to  a foreign market and snobbishness were undreamed-of  degradations.  Paris had not yet been turned into the FOIRE DU  MONDE that she has since become, with whole quarters given  over to the use of foreigners, - theatres, restaurants, and  hotels created only for the use of a polyglot population that  could give lessons to the people around Babel&#x27;s famous  &quot;tower.&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 13 - Some American Husbands</p>
<p>UNTIL the beginning of this century men played the BEAU ROLE  in life&#x27;s comedy.  As in the rest of the animal world, our  males were the brilliant members of the community, flaunting  their gaudy plumage at home and abroad, while the women-folk  remained in seclusion, tending their children, directing the  servants, or ministering to their lords&#x27; comfort.</p>
<p>In those happy days the husband ruled supreme at his own  fireside, receiving the homage of the family, who bent to his  will and obeyed his orders.</p>
<p>During the last century, however, the &quot;part&quot; of better half  has become less and less attractive in America, one  prerogative after another having been whisked away by  enterprising wives.  Modern Delilahs have yearly snipped off  more and more of Samson&#x27;s luxuriant curls, and added those  ornaments to their own COIFFURES, until in the majority of  families the husband finds himself reduced to a state of  bondage compared with which the biblical hero enjoyed a  pampered idleness.  Times have indeed changed in America since  the native chief sat in dignified repose bedizened with all  the finery at hand, while the ladies of the family waited  tremblingly upon him.  To-day it is the American husband who  turns the grindstone all the year round, and it is his pretty  tyrant who enjoys the elegant leisure that a century ago was  considered a masculine luxury.</p>
<p>To America must be given the credit of having produced the  model husband, a new species, as it were, of the GENUS HOMO.</p>
<p>In no role does a compatriot appear to such advantage as in  that of Benedict.  As a boy he is often too advanced for his  years or his information; in youth he is conspicuous neither  for his culture nor his unselfishness.  But once in  matrimonial harness this untrained animal becomes bridle-wise  with surprising rapidity, and will for the rest of life go  through his paces, waltzing, kneeing, and saluting with hardly  a touch of the whip.  Whether this is the result of superior  horse-womanship on the part of American wives or a trait  peculiar to sons of &quot;Uncle Sam,&quot; is hard to say, but the fact  is self-evident to any observer that our fair equestrians  rarely meet with a rebellious mount.</p>
<p>Any one who has studied marital ways in other lands will  realize that in no country have the men effaced themselves so  gracefully as with us.  In this respect no foreign production  can compare for a moment with the domestic article.  In  English, French, and German families the husband is still all- powerful.  The house is mounted, guests are asked, and the  year planned out to suit his occupations and pleasure.  Here  papa is rarely consulted until such matters have been decided  upon by the ladies, when the head of the house is called in to  sign the checks.</p>
<p>I have had occasion more than once to bewail the shortcomings  of the American man, and so take pleasure in pointing out the  modesty and good temper with which he fills this role.  He is  trained from the beginning to give all and expect nothing in  return, an American girl rarely bringing any DOT to her  husband, no matter how wealthy her family may be.  If, as  occasionally happens, an income is allowed a bride by her  parents, she expects to spend it on her toilets or pleasures.   This condition of the matrimonial market exists in no other  country; even in England, where MARIAGES DE CONVENANCE are  rare, &quot;settlements&quot; form an inevitable prelude to conjugal  bliss.</p>
<p>The fact that she contributes little or nothing to the common  income in no way embarrasses an American wife; her pretensions  are usually in an inverse proportion to her personal means.  A  man I knew some years ago deliberately chose his bride from an  impecunious family (in the hope that her simple surroundings  had inculcated homely taste), and announced to an incredulous  circle of friends, at his last bachelor dinner, that he  intended, in future, to pass his evenings at his fireside,  between his book and his pretty spouse.  Poor, innocent,  confiding mortal!  The wife quickly became a belle of the  fastest set in town.  Having had more than she wanted of  firesides and quiet evenings before her marriage, her idea was  to go about as much as possible, and, when not so occupied, to  fill her house with company.  It may be laid down as a maxim  in this connection that a man marries to obtain a home, and a  girl to get away from one; hence disappointment on both sides.</p>
<p>The couple in question have in all probability not passed an  evening alone since they were married, the lady rarely  stopping in the round of her gayeties until she collapses from  fatigue.  Their home is typical of their life, which itself  can be taken as a good example of the existence that most of  our &quot;smart&quot; people lead.  The ground floor and the first floor  are given up to entertaining.  The second is occupied by the  spacious sitting, bath, and sleeping rooms of the lady.  A  ten-by-twelve chamber suffices for my lord, and the only den  he can rightly call his own is a small room near the front  door, about as private as the sidewalk, which is turned into a  cloak-room whenever the couple receive, making it impossible  to keep books or papers of value there, or even to use it as a  smoking-room after dinner, so his men guests sit around the  dismantled dining-table while the ladies are enjoying a suite  of parlors above.</p>
<p>At first the idea of such an unequal division of the house  shocks our sense of justice, until we reflect that the  American husband is not expected to remain at home.  That&#x27;s  not his place!  If he is not down town making money, fashion  dictates that he must be at some club-house playing a game.  A  man who should remain at home, and read or chat with the  ladies of his family, would be considered a bore and unmanly.   There seems to be no place in an American house for its head.   More than once when the friend I have referred to has asked  me, at the club, to dine informally with him, we have found,  on arriving, that Madame, having an evening off, had gone to  bed and forgotten to order any dinner, so we were obliged to  return to the club for our meal.  When, however, his wife is  in good health, she expects her weary husband to accompany her  to dinner, opera, or ball, night after night, oblivious of the  work the morrow holds in store for him.</p>
<p>In one family I know, paterfamilias goes by the name of the  &quot;purse.&quot;  The more one sees of American households the more  appropriate that name appears.  Everything is expected of the  husband, and he is accorded no definite place in return.  He  leaves the house at 8.30.  When he returns, at five, if his  wife is entertaining a man at tea, it would be considered the  height of indelicacy for him to intrude upon them, for his  arrival would cast a chill on the conversation.  When a couple  dine out, the husband is always LA BETE NOIRE of the hostess,  no woman wanting to sit next to a married man, if she can help  it.</p>
<p>The few Benedicts who have had the courage to break away from  these conditions and amuse themselves with yachts, salmon  rivers, or &quot;grass-bachelor&quot; trips to Europe, while secretly  admired by the women, are frowned upon in society as dangerous  examples, likely to sow the seeds of discontent among their  comrades; although it is the commonest thing in the world for  an American wife to take the children and go abroad on a tour.</p>
<p>Imagine a German or Italian wife announcing to her spouse that  she had decided to run over to England for a year with her  children, that they might learn English.  The mind recoils in  horror from the idea of the catastrophe that would ensue.</p>
<p>Glance around a ball-room, a dinner party, or the opera, if  you have any doubts as to the unselfishness of our married  men.  How many of them do you suppose are present for their  own pleasure?  The owner of an opera box rarely retains a seat  in his expensive quarters.  You generally find him idling in  the lobbies looking at his watch, or repairing to a  neighboring concert hall to pass the weary hours.  At a ball  it is even worse.  One wonders why card-rooms are not provided  at large balls (as is the custom abroad), where the bored  husbands might find a little solace over &quot;bridge,&quot; instead of  yawning in the coat-room or making desperate signs to their  wives from the doorway, - signals of distress, by the bye,  that rarely produce any effect.</p>
<p>It is the rebellious husband who is admired and courted,  however.  A curious trait of human nature compels admiration  for whatever is harmful, and forces us, in spite of our better  judgment, to depreciate the useful and beneficent.  The coats- of-arms of all countries are crowded with eagles and lions,  that never yet did any good, living or dead; orators enlarge  on the fine qualities of these birds and beasts, and hold them  up as models, while using as terms of reproach the name of the  goose or the cow, creatures that minister in a hundred ways to  our wants.  Such a spirit has brought helpful, productive  &quot;better halves&quot; to the humble place they now occupy in the  eyes of our people.</p>
<p>As long as men passed their time in fighting and carousing  they were heroes; as soon as they became patient bread-winners  all the romance evaporated from their atmosphere.  The Jewish  Hercules had his revenge in the end and made things  disagreeable for his tormentors.  So far, however, there are  no signs of a revolt among the shorn lambs in this country.   They patiently bend their necks to the collar - the kindest,  most loving and devoted helpmates that ever plodded under the  matrimonial yoke.</p>
<p>When in the East, one watches with admiration the part a  donkey plays in the economy of those primitive lands.  All the  work is reserved for that industrious animal, and little play  falls to his share.  The camel is always bad-tempered, and  when overladen lies down, refusing to move until relieved of  its burden.  The Turk is lazy and selfish, the native women  pass their time in chattering and giggling, the children play  and squabble, the ubiquitous dog sleeps in the sun; but from  daybreak to midnight the little mouse-colored donkeys toil  unceasingly.  All burdens too bulky or too cumbersome for man  are put on his back; the provender which horses and camels  have refused becomes his portion; he is the first to begin the  day&#x27;s labor, and the last to turn in.  It is impossible to  live long in the Orient or the south of France without  becoming attached to those gentle, willing animals.  The role  which honest &quot;Bourico&quot; fills so well abroad is played on this  side of the Atlantic by the American husband.</p>
<p>I mean no disrespect to my married compatriots; on the  contrary, I admire them as I do all docile, unselfish beings.   It is well for our women, however, that their lords, like the  little Oriental donkeys, ignore their strength, and are  content to toil on to the end of their days, expecting neither  praise nor thanks in return.</p>
<p>Chapter 14 - &quot;CAROLUS&quot;</p>
<p>IN the early seventies a group of students - dissatisfied with  the cut-and-dried instruction of the Paris art school and  attracted by certain qualities of color and technique in the  work of a young Frenchman from the city of Lille, who was just  beginning to attract the attention of connoisseurs - went in a  body to his studio with the request that he would oversee  their work and direct their studies.  The artist thus chosen  was Carolus-Duran.  Oddly enough, a majority of the youths who  sought him out and made him their master were Americans.</p>
<p>The first modest workroom on the Boulevard Montparnasse was  soon too small to hold the pupils who crowded under this newly  raised banner, and a move was made to more commodious quarters  near the master&#x27;s private studio.  Sargent, Dannat, Harrison,  Beckwith, Hinckley, and many others whom it is needless to  mention here, will - if these lines come under their notice -  doubtless recall with a thrill of pleasure the roomy one- storied structure in the rue Notre-Dame des Champs where we  established our ATELIER D&#x27;ELEVES, a self-supporting  cooperative concern, each student contributing ten francs a  month toward rent, fire, and models, &quot;Carolus&quot; - the name by  which this master is universally known abroad - not only  refusing all compensation, according to the immutable custom  of French painters of distinction, but, as we discovered  later, contributing too often from his own pocket to help out  the MASSIER at the end of a difficult season, or smooth the  path of some improvident pupil.</p>
<p>Those were cloudless, enchanted days we passed in the tumbled  down old atelier: an ardent springtime of life when the future  beckons gayly and no doubts of success obscure the horizon.   Our young master&#x27;s enthusiasm fired his circle of pupils, who,  as each succeeding year brought him increasing fame, revelled  in a reflected glory with the generous admiration of youth, in  which there is neither calculation nor shadow of envy.</p>
<p>A portrait of Madame de Portalais, exhibited about this time,  drew all art-loving Paris around the new celebrity&#x27;s canvas.   Shortly after, the government purchased a painting (of our  master&#x27;s beautiful wife), now known as LA FEMME AU GANT, for  the Luxembourg Gallery.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overestimate the impetus that a master&#x27;s  successes impart to the progress of his pupils.  My first  studious year in Paris had been passed in the shadow of an  elderly painter, who was comfortably dozing on the laurels of  thirty years before.  The change from that sleepy environment  to the vivid enthusiasm and dash of Carolus-Duran&#x27;s studio was  like stepping out of a musty cloister into the warmth and  movement of a market-place.</p>
<p>Here, be it said in passing, lies perhaps the secret of the  dry rot that too often settles on our American art schools.   We, for some unknown reason, do not take the work of native  painters seriously, nor encourage them in proportion to their  merit.  In consequence they retain but a feeble hold upon  their pupils.</p>
<p>Carolus, handsome, young, successful, courted, was an ideal  leader for a band of ambitious, high-strung youths, repaying  their devotion with an untiring interest and lifting clever  and dull alike on the strong wings of his genius.  His visits  to the studio, on which his friend Henner often accompanied  him, were frequent and prolonged; certain Tuesdays being  especially appreciated by us, as they were set apart for his  criticism of original compositions.</p>
<p>When our sketches (the subject for which had been given out in  advance) were arranged, and we had seated ourselves in a big  half-circle on the floor, Carolus would install himself on a  tall stool, the one seat the studio boasted, and chat A PROPOS  of the works before him on composition, on classic art, on the  theories of color and clair-obscur.  Brilliant talks, inlaid  with much wit and incisive criticism, the memory of which must  linger in the minds of all who were fortunate enough to hear  them.  Nor was it to the studio alone that our master&#x27;s  interest followed us.  He would drop in at the Louvre, when we  were copying there, and after some pleasant words of advice  and encouragement, lead us off for a stroll through the  galleries, interrupted by stations before his favorite  masterpieces.</p>
<p>So important has he always considered a constant study of  Renaissance art that recently, when about to commence his  TRIUMPH OF BACCHUS, Carolus copied one of Rubens&#x27;s larger  canvases with all the naivete of a beginner.</p>
<p>An occasion soon presented itself for us to learn another side  of our trade by working with our master on a ceiling ordered  of him by the state for the Palace of the Luxembourg.  The  vast studios which the city of Paris provides on occasions of  this kind, with a liberality that should make our home  corporations reflect, are situated out beyond the Exhibition  buildings, in a curious, unfrequented quarter, ignored alike  by Parisians and tourists, where the city stores compromising  statues and the valuable debris of her many revolutions.   There, among throneless Napoleons and riderless bronze steeds,  we toiled for over six months side by side with our master, on  gigantic APOTHEOSIS OF MARIE DE MEDICIS, serving in turn as  painter and painted, and leaving the imprint of our hands and  the reflection of our faces scattered about the composition.   Day after day, when work was over, we would hoist the big  canvas by means of a system of ropes and pulleys, from a  perpendicular to the horizontal position it was to occupy  permanently, and then sit straining our necks and discussing  the progress of the work until the tardy spring twilight  warned us to depart.</p>
<p>The year 1877 brought Carolus-Duran the MEDAILLE D&#x27;HONNEUR, a  crowning recompense that set the atelier mad with delight.  We  immediately organized a great (but economical) banquet to  commemorate the event, over which our master presided, with  much modesty, considering the amount of incense we burned  before him, and the speeches we made.  One of our number even  burst into some very bad French verses, asserting that the  painters of the world in general fell back before him -</p>
<p>. . . EPOUVANTES -  CRAIGNANT EGALEMENT SA BROSSE ET SON EPEE.</p>
<p>This allusion to his proficiency in fencing was considered  particularly neat, and became the favorite song of the studio,  to be howled in and out of season.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, there is always something in Carolus-Duran&#x27;s  attitude when at work which recalls the swordsman.  With an  enormous palette in one hand and a brush in the other, he has  a way of planting himself in front of his sitter that is  amusingly suggestive of a duel.  His lithe body sways to and  fro, his fine leonine face quivers with the intense study of  his model; then with a sudden spring forward, a few rapid  touches are dashed on the canvas (like home strokes in the  enemy&#x27;s weakest spot) with a precision of hand acquired only  by long years of fencing.</p>
<p>An order to paint the king and queen of Portugal was the next  step on the road to fame, another rung on the pleasant ladder  of success.  When this work was done the delighted sovereign  presented the painter with the order of &quot;Christ of Portugal,&quot;  together with many other gifts, among which a caricature of  the master at work, signed by his sitter, is not the least  valued.</p>
<p>When the great schism occurred several years ago which rent  the art world of France, Carolus-Duran was elected vice- president of the new school under Meissonier, to whose office  he succeeded on that master&#x27;s death; and now directs and  presides over the yearly exhibition known as the SALON DU  CHAMP DE MARS.</p>
<p>At his chateau near Paris or at Saint Raphael, on the  Mediterranean, the master lives, like Leonardo of old, the  existence of a grand seigneur, surrounded by his family,  innumerable guests, and the horses and dogs he loves, - a  group of which his ornate figure and expressive face form the  natural centre.  Each year he lives more away from the world,  but no more inspiriting sight can be imagined than the welcome  the president receives of a &quot;varnishing&quot; day, when he makes  his entry surrounded by his pupils.  The students cheer  themselves hoarse, and the public climbs on everything that  comes to hand to see him pass.  It is hard to realize then  that this is the same man who, not content with his youthful  progress, retired into an Italian monastery that he might  commune face to face with nature undisturbed.</p>
<p>The works of no other painter give me the same sensation of  quivering vitality, except the Velasquez in the Madrid Gallery  and, perhaps, Sargent at his best; and one feels all through  the American painter&#x27;s work the influence of his first and  only master.</p>
<p>&quot;TOUT CE QUI N&#x27;EST PAS INDISPENSABLE EST NUISIBLE,&quot; a phrase  which is often on Carolus-Duran&#x27;s lips, may be taken as the  keynote of his work, where one finds a noble simplicity of  line and color scheme, an elimination of useless detail, a  contempt for tricks to enforce an effect, and above all a  comprehension and mastery of light, vitality, and texture -  those three unities of the painter&#x27;s art - that bring his  canvases very near to those of his self-imposed Spanish  master.</p>
<p>Those who know the French painter&#x27;s more important works and  his many splendid studies from the nude, feel it a pity that  such masterpieces as the equestrian portrait of Mlle.  Croisette, of the Comedie Francaise, the REVEIL, the superb  full length of Mme. Pelouse on the Terrace of Chenonceau, and  the head of Gounod in the Luxembourg, could not be collected  into one exhibition, that lovers of art here in America might  realize for themselves how this master&#x27;s works are of the  class that typify a school and an epoch, and engrave their  author&#x27;s name among those destined to become household words  in the mouths of future generations.</p>
<p>Chapter 15 - The Grand Opera Fad</p>
<p>WITHOUT being more curious than my neighbors, there are  several social mysteries that I should like to fathom, among  others, the real reasons that induce the different classes of  people one sees at the opera to attend that form of  entertainment.</p>
<p>A taste for the theatre is natural enough.  It is also easy to  understand why people who are fond of sport and animals enjoy  races and dog shows.  But the continued vogue of grand opera,  and more especially of Wagner&#x27;s long-drawn-out compositions,  among our restless, unmusical compatriots, remains  unexplained.</p>
<p>The sheeplike docility of our public is apparent in numberless  ways; in none, however, more strikingly than in their choice  of amusements.  In business and religion, people occasionally  think for themselves; in the selection of entertainments,  never! but are apparently content to receive their opinions  and prejudices ready-made from some unseen and omnipotent  Areopagus.</p>
<p>The careful study of an opera audience from different parts of  our auditorium has brought me to the conclusion that the  public there may be loosely divided into three classes -  leaving out reporters of fashionable intelligence, dressmakers  in search of ideas, and the lady inhabitants of &quot;Crank Alley&quot;  (as a certain corner of the orchestra is called), who sit in  perpetual adoration before the elderly tenor.</p>
<p>First - but before venturing further on dangerously thin ice,  it may be as well to suggest that this subject is not treated  in absolute seriousness, and that all assertions must not be  taken AU PIED DE LA LETTRE.  First, then, and most important,  come the stockholders, for without them the Metropolitan would  close.  The majority of these fortunate people and their  guests look upon the opera as a social function, where one can  meet one&#x27;s friends and be seen, an entertaining antechamber in  which to linger until it&#x27;s time to &quot;go on,&quot; her Box being to- day as necessary a part of a great lady&#x27;s outfit as a country  house or a ball-room.</p>
<p>Second are those who attend because it has become the correct  thing to be seen at the opera.  There is so much wealth in  this city and so little opportunity for its display, so many  people long to go about who are asked nowhere, that the opera  has been seized upon as a centre in which to air rich apparel  and elbow the &quot;world.&quot;  This list fills a large part of the  closely packed parquet and first balcony.</p>
<p>Third, and last, come the lovers of music, who mostly inhabit  greater altitudes.</p>
<p>The motive of the typical box-owner is simple.  Her night at  the opera is the excuse for a cosy little dinner, one woman  friend (two would spoil the effect of the box) and four men,  without counting the husband, who appears at dinner, but  rarely goes further.  The pleasant meal and the subsequent  smoke are prolonged until 9 or 9.30, when the men are finally  dragged murmuring from their cigars.  If she has been  fortunate and timed her arrival to correspond with an  ENTR&#x27;ACTE, my lady is radiant.  The lights are up, she can see  who are present, and the public can inspect her toilet and  jewels as she settles herself under the combine d gaze of the  house, and proceeds to hold an informal reception for the rest  of the evening.  The men she has brought with her quickly cede  their places to callers, and wander yawning in the lobby or  invade the neighboring boxes and add their voices to the  general murmur.</p>
<p>Although there is much less talking than formerly, it is the  toleration of this custom at all by the public that indicates  (along with many other straws) that we are not a music-loving  people.  Audible conversation during a performance would not  be allowed for a moment by a Continental audience.  The little  visiting that takes place in boxes abroad is done during the  ENTR&#x27;ACTES, when people retire to the salons back of their  LOGES to eat ices and chat.  Here those little parlors are  turned into cloak-rooms, and small talk goes on in many boxes  during the entire performance.  The joke or scandal of the day  is discussed; strangers in town, or literary and artistic  lights - &quot;freaks,&quot; they are discriminatingly called - are  pointed out, toilets passed in review, and those dreadful two  hours passed which, for some undiscovered reason, must elapse  between a dinner and a dance.  If a favorite tenor is singing,  and no one happens to be whispering nonsense over her  shoulder, my lady may listen in a distrait way.  It is not  safe, however, to count on prolonged attention or ask her  questions about the performance.  She is apt to be a bit hazy  as to who is singing, and with the exception of FAUST and  CARMEN, has rudimentary ideas about plots.  Singers come and  go, weep, swoon, or are killed, without interfering with her  equanimity.  She has, for instance, seen the HUGUENOTS and the  RHEINGOLD dozens of times, but knows no more why Raoul is  brought blindfolded to Chenonceaux, or what Wotan and Erda say  to each other in their interminable scenes, than she does of  the contents of the Vedas.  For the matter of that, if three  or four principal airs were suppressed from an opera and the  scenery and costumes changed, many in that chattering circle  would, I fear, not know what they were listening to.</p>
<p>Last winter, when Melba sang in AIDA, disguised by dark hair  and a brown skin, a lady near me vouchsafed the opinion that  the &quot;little black woman hadn&#x27;t a bad voice;&quot; a gentleman (to  whom I remarked last week &quot;that as Sembrich had sung Rosina in  the BARBER, it was rather a shock to see her appear as that  lady&#x27;s servant in the MARIAGE DE FIGARO&quot;) looked his blank  amazement until it was explained to him that one of those  operas was a continuation of the other.  After a pause he  remarked, &quot;They are not by the same composer, anyway!  Because  the first&#x27;s by Rossini, and the MARIAGE is by Bon Marche.   I&#x27;ve been at his shop in Paris.&quot;</p>
<p>The presence of the second category - the would-be fashionable  people - is not so easily accounted for.  Their attendance can  hardly be attributed to love of melody, as they are, if  anything, a shade less musical than the box-dwellers, who, by  the bye, seem to exercise an irresistible fascination, to  judge by the trend of conversation and direction of glasses.   Although an imposing and sufficiently attentive throng, it  would be difficult to find a less discriminating public than  that which gathers nightly in the Metropolitan parterre.  One  wonders how many of those people care for music and how many  attend because it is expensive and &quot;swell.&quot;</p>
<p>They will listen with the same bland contentment to either bad  or good performances so long as a world-renowned artist (some  one who is being paid a comfortable little fortune for the  evening) is on the stage.  The orchestra may be badly led (it  often is); the singers may flat - or be out of voice; the  performance may go all at sixes and sevens - there is never a  murmur of dissent.  Faults that would set an entire audience  at Naples or Milan hissing are accepted herewith ignorant  approval.</p>
<p>The unfortunate part of it is that this weakness of ours has  become known.  The singers feel they can give an American  audience any slipshod performance.  I have seen a favorite  soprano shrug her shoulders as she entered her dressing-room  and exclaim: &quot;MON DIEU!  How I shuffled through that act!   They&#x27;d have hooted me off the stage in Berlin, but here no one  seems to care.  Did you notice the baritone to-night?  He  wasn&#x27;t on the key once during our duo.  I cannot sing my best,  try as I will, when I hear the public applauding good and bad  alike!&quot;</p>
<p>It is strange that our pleasure-loving rich people should have  hit on the opera as a favorite haunt.  We and the English are  the only race who will attend performances in a foreign  language which we don&#x27;t understand.  How can intelligent  people who don&#x27;t care for music go on, season after season,  listening to operas, the plots of which they ignore, and which  in their hearts they find dull?</p>
<p>Is it so very amusing to watch two middle-aged ladies nagging  each other, at two o&#x27;clock in the morning, on a public square,  as they do in LOHENGRIN?  Do people find the lecture that  Isolde&#x27;s husband delivers to the guilty lovers entertaining?   Does an opera produce any illusion on my neighbors?  I wish it  did on me!  I see too plainly the paint on the singers&#x27; hot  faces and the cords straining in their tired throats!  I sit  on certain nights in agony, fearing to see stout Romeo roll on  the stage in apoplexy!  The sopranos, too, have a way, when  about to emit a roulade, that is more suggestive of a  dentist&#x27;s chair, and the attendant gargle, than of a love  phrase.</p>
<p>When two celebrities combine in a final duo, facing the public  and not each other, they give the impression of victims whom  an unseen inquisitor is torturing.  Each turn of his screw  draws out a wilder cry.  The orchestra (in the pay of the  demon) does all it can to prevent their shrieks from reaching  the public.  The lovers in turn redouble their efforts; they  are purple in the face and glistening with perspiration.   Defeat, they know, is before them, for the orchestra has the  greater staying power!  The flutes bleat; the trombones grunt;  the fiddles squeal; an epileptic leader cuts wildly into the  air about him.  When, finally, their strength exhausted, the  breathless human beings, with one last ear-piercing note, give  up the struggle and retire, the public, excited by the unequal  contest, bursts into thunders of applause.</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t it be a good idea, in order to avoid these  painful exhibitions, to have an arrangement of screens, with  the singing people behind and a company of young and  attractive pantomimists going through the gestures and  movements in front?  Otherwise, how can the most imaginative  natures lose themselves at an opera?  Even when the singers  are comely, there is always that eternal double row of stony- faced witnesses in full view, whom no crimes astonish and no  misfortunes melt.  It takes most of the poetry out of Faust&#x27;s  first words with Marguerite, to have that short interview  interrupted by a line of old, weary women shouting, &quot;Let us  whirl in the waltz o&#x27;er the mount and the plain!&quot;  Or when  Scotch Lucy appears in a smart tea-gown and is good enough to  perform difficult exercises before a half-circle of Italian  gentlemen in pantalets and ladies in court costumes, does she  give any one the illusion of an abandoned wife dying of a  broken heart alone in the Highlands?  Broken heart, indeed!   It&#x27;s much more likely she&#x27;ll die of a ruptured blood-vessel!</p>
<p>Philistines in matters musical, like myself, unfortunate  mortals whom the sweetest sounds fail to enthrall when  connected with no memory or idea, or when prolonged beyond a  limited period, must approach the third group with hesitation  and awe.  That they are sincere, is evident.  The rapt  expressions of their faces, and their patience, bear testimony  to this fact.  For a long time I asked myself, &quot;Where have I  seen that intense, absorbed attitude before?&quot;  Suddenly one  evening another scene rose in my memory.</p>
<p>Have you ever visited Tangiers?  In the market-place of that  city you will find the inhabitants crouched by hundreds around  their native musicians.  When we were there, one old duffer -  the Wagner, doubtless, of the place - was having an immense  success.  No matter at what hour of the day we passed through  that square, there was always the same spellbound circle of  half-clad Turks and Arabs squatting silent while &quot;Wagner&quot;  tinkled to them on a three-stringed lute and chanted in a  high-pitched, dismal whine - like the squeaking of an  unfastened door in the wind.  At times, for no apparent  reason, the never-varying, never-ending measure would be  interrupted by a flutter of applause, but his audience  remained mostly sunk in a hypnotic apathy.  I never see a  &quot;Ring&quot; audience now without thinking of that scene outside the  Bab-el-Marsa gate, which has led me to ask different people  just what sensations serious music produced upon them.  The  answers have been varied and interesting.  One good lady who  rarely misses a German opera confessed that sweet sounds acted  upon her like opium.  Neither scenery nor acting nor plot were  of any importance.  From the first notes of the overture to  the end, she floated in an ecstatic dream, oblivious of time  and place.  When it was over she came back to herself faint  with fatigue.  Another professed lover of Wagner said that his  greatest pleasure was in following the different &quot;motives&quot; as  they recurred in the music.  My faith in that gentleman was  shaken, however, when I found the other evening that he had  mistaken Van Dyck for Jean de Reszke through an entire  performance.  He may be a dab at recognizing his friends the  &quot;motives,&quot; but his discoveries don&#x27;t apparently go as far as  tenors!</p>
<p>No one doubts that hundreds of people unaffectedly love German  opera, but that as many affect to appreciate it in order to  appear intellectual is certain.</p>
<p>Once upon a time the unworthy member of an ultra-serious  &quot;Browning&quot; class in this city, doubting the sincerity of her  companions, asked permission to read them a poem of the  master&#x27;s which she found beyond her comprehension.  When the  reading was over the opinion of her friends was unanimous.   &quot;Nothing could be simpler!  The lines were lucidity itself!   Such close reasoning etc.&quot;  But dismay fell upon them when the  naughty lady announced, with a peal of laughter, that she had  been reading alternate lines from opposite pages.  She no  longer disturbs the harmony of that circle!</p>
<p>Bearing this tale in mind, I once asked a musician what  proportion of the audience at a &quot;Ring&quot; performance he thought  would know if alternate scenes were given from two of Wagner&#x27;s  operas, unless the scenery enlightened them.  His estimate was  that perhaps fifty per cent might find out the fraud.  He put  the number of people who could give an intelligent account of  those plots at about thirty per hundred.</p>
<p>The popularity of music, he added, is largely due to the fact  that it saves people the trouble of thinking.  Pleasant sounds  soothe the nerves, and, if prolonged long enough in a darkened  room will, like the Eastern tom-toms, lull the senses into a  mild form of trance.  This must be what the gentleman meant  who said he wished he could sleep as well in a &quot;Wagner&quot; car as  he did at one of his operas!</p>
<p>Being a tailless old fox, I look with ever-increasing  suspicion on the too-luxuriant caudal appendages of my  neighbors, and think with amusement of the multitudes who  during the last ten years have sacrificed themselves upon the  altar of grand opera - simple, kindly souls, with little or no  taste for classical music, who have sat in the dark (mentally  and physically), applauding what they didn&#x27;t understand, and  listening to vague German mythology set to sounds that appear  to us outsiders like music sunk into a verbose dotage.  I am  convinced the greater number would have preferred a jolly  performance of MME. ANGOT or the CLOCHES DE CORNEVILLE, cut in  two by a good ballet.</p>
<p>It is, however, so easy to be mistaken on subjects of this  kind that generalizing is dangerous.  Many great authorities  have liked tuneless music.  One of the most telling arguments  in its favor was recently advanced by a foreigner.  The  Chinese ambassador told us last winter in a club at Washington  that Wagner&#x27;s was the only European music that he appreciated  and enjoyed.  &quot;You see,&quot; he added, &quot;music is a much older art  with us than in Europe, and has naturally reached a far  greater perfection.  The German school has made a long step in  advance, and I can now foresee a day not far distant when,  under its influence, your music will closely resemble our  own.&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 16 - The Poetic CABARETS of Paris</p>
<p>THOSE who have not lived in France can form little idea of the  important place the CAFE occupies in the life of an average  Frenchman, clubs as we know them or as they exist in England  being rare, and when found being, with few exceptions, but  gambling-houses in disguise.  As a Frenchman rarely asks an  acquaintance, or even a friend, to his apartment, the CAFE has  become the common ground where all meet, for business or  pleasure.  Not in Paris only, but all over France, in every  garrison town, provincial city, or tiny village, the CAFE is  the chief attraction, the centre of thought, the focus toward  which all the rays of masculine existence converge.</p>
<p>For the student, newly arrived from the provinces, to whose  modest purse the theatres and other places of amusement are  practically closed, the CAFE is a supreme resource.  His mind  is moulded, his ideas and opinions formed, more by what he  hears and sees there than by any other influence.  A  restaurant is of little importance.  One may eat anywhere.   But the choice of his CAFE will often give the bent to a young  man&#x27;s career, and indicate his exact shade of politics and his  opinions on literature, music, or art.  In Paris, to know a  man at all is to know where you can find him at the hour of  the APERITIF - what Baudelaire called</p>
<p>L&#x27;HEURE SAINTE DE L&#x27;ABSINTHE.</p>
<p>When young men form a society among themselves, a CAFE is  chosen as their meeting-place.  Thousands of establishments  exist only by such patronage, as, for example, the Cafe de la  Regence, Place du Theatre Francais, which is frequented  entirely by men who play chess.</p>
<p>Business men transact their affairs as much over their coffee  as in their offices.  The reading man finds at his CAFE the  daily and weekly papers; a writer is sure of the undisturbed  possession of pen, ink, and paper.  Henri Murger, the author,  when asked once why he continued to patronize a certain  establishment notorious for the inferior quality of its beer,  answered, &quot;Yes, the beer is poor, but they keep such good  INK!&quot;</p>
<p>The use of a CAFE does not imply any great expenditure, a  CONSUMMATION costing but little.  With it is acquired the  right to use the establishment for an indefinite number of  hours, the client being warmed, lighted, and served.  From  five to seven, and again after dinner, the HABITUES stroll in,  grouping themselves about the small tables, each new-comer  joining a congenial circle, ordering his drink, and settling  himself for a long sitting.  The last editorial, the newest  picture, or the fall of a ministry is discussed with a  vehemence and an interest unknown to Anglo-Saxon natures.   Suddenly, in the excitement of the discussion, some one will  rise in his place and begin speaking.  If you happen to drop  in at that moment, the lady at the desk will welcome you with,  &quot;You are just in time!  Monsieur So-and-So is speaking; the  evening promises to be interesting.&quot;  She is charmed; her  establishment will shine with a reflected light, and new  patrons be drawn there, if the debates are brilliant.  So  universal is this custom that there is hardly an orator to-day  at the French bar or in the Senate, who has not broken his  first lance in some such obscure tournament, under the smiling  glances of the DAME DU COMPTOIR.</p>
<p>Opposite the Palace of the Luxembourg, in the heart of the old  Latin Quarter, stands a quaint building, half hotel, half  CAFE, where many years ago Joseph II. resided while visiting  his sister, Marie Antoinette.  It is known now as Foyot&#x27;s;  this name must awaken many happy memories in the hearts of  American students, for it was long their favorite meeting- place.  In the early seventies a club, formed among the  literary and poetic youth of Paris, selected Foyot&#x27;s as their  &quot;home&quot; during the winter months.  Their summer vacations were  spent in visiting the university towns of France, reciting  verses, or acting in original plays at Nancy, Bordeaux, Lyons,  or Caen.  The enthusiasm these youthful performances created  inspired one of their number with the idea of creating in  Paris, on a permanent footing, a centre where a limited public  could meet the young poets of the day and hear them recite  their verses and monologues in an informal way.</p>
<p>The success of the original &quot;Chat Noir,&quot; the first CABARET of  this kind, was largely owing to the sympathetic and attractive  nature of its founder, young Salis, who drew around him, by  his sunny disposition, shy personalities who, but for him,  would still be &quot;mute, inglorious Miltons.&quot;  Under his kindly  and discriminating rule many a successful literary career has  started.  Salis&#x27;s gifted nature combined a delicate taste and  critical acumen with a rare business ability.  His first  venture, an obscure little CAFE on the Boulevard Rochechouart,  in the outlying quarter beyond the Place Pigalle, quickly  became famous, its ever-increasing vogue forcing its happy  proprietor to seek more commodious quarters in the rue Victor  Masse, where the world-famous &quot;Chat Noir&quot; was installed with  much pomp and many joyous ceremonies.</p>
<p>The old word CABARET, corresponding closely to our English  &quot;inn,&quot; was chosen, and the establishment decorated in  imitation of a Louis XIII. HOTELLERIE.  Oaken beams supported  the low-studded ceilings: The plaster walls disappeared behind  tapestries, armor, old FAIENCE.  Beer and other liquids were  served in quaint porcelain or pewter mugs, and the waiters  were dressed (merry anachronism) in the costume of members of  the Institute (the Immortal Forty), who had so long led poetry  in chains.  The success of the &quot;Black Cat&quot; in her new quarters  was immense, all Paris crowding through her modest doors.   Salis had founded Montmartre! - the rugged old hill giving  birth to a generation of writers and poets, and nourishing  this new school at her granite breasts.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to imagine a form of entertainment more  tempting than was offered in this picturesque inn.  In  addition to the first, the entire second floor of the building  had been thrown into one large room, the walls covered with a  thousand sketches, caricatures, and crayon drawings by hands  since celebrated the world over.  A piano, with many chairs  and tables, completed the unpretending installation.  Here,  during a couple of hours each evening, either by the piano or  simply standing in their places, the young poets gave  utterance to the creations of their imagination, the musicians  played their latest inspirations, the RACONTEUR told his  newest story.  They called each other and the better known  among the guests by their names, and joked mutual weaknesses,  eliminating from these gatherings every shade of a perfunctory  performance.</p>
<p>It is impossible to give an idea of the delicate flavor of  such informal evenings - the sensation of being at home that  the picturesque surroundings produced, the low murmur of  conversation, the clink of glasses, the swing of the waltz  movement played by a master hand, interrupted only when some  slender form would lean against the piano and pour forth  burning words of infinite pathos, - the inspired young face  lighted up by the passion and power of the lines.  The burst  of applause that his talent called forth would hardly have  died away before another figure would take the poet&#x27;s place, a  wave of laughter welcoming the new-comer, whose twinkling eyes  and demure smile promised a treat of fun and humor.  So the  evening would wear gayly to its end, the younger element in  the audience, full of the future, drinking in long draughts of  poetry and art, the elders charmed to live over again the days  of their youth and feel in touch once more with the present.</p>
<p>In this world of routine and conventions an innovation as  brilliantly successful as this could hardly be inaugurated  without raising a whirlwind of jealousy and opposition.  The  struggle was long and arduous.  Directors of theatres and  concert halls, furious to see a part of their public tempted  away, raised the cry of immorality against the new-comers, and  called to their aid every resource of law and chicanery.  At  the end of the first year Salis found himself with over eight  hundred summonses and lawsuits on his hands.  After having  made every effort, knocked at every door, in his struggle for  existence, he finally conceived the happy thought of appealing  directly to Grevy, then President of the Republic, and in his  audience with the latter succeeded in charming and interesting  him, as he had so many others.  The influence of the head of  the state once brought to bear on the affair, Salis had the  joy of seeing opposition crushed and the storm blow itself  out.</p>
<p>From this moment, the poets, feeling themselves appreciated  and their rights acknowledged and defended, flocked to the  &quot;Sacred Mountain,&quot; as Montmartre began to be called; other  establishments of the same character sprang up in the  neighborhood.  Most important among these were the &quot;4 z&#x27;Arts,&quot;  Boulevard de Clichy, the &quot;Tambourin,&quot; and La Butte.</p>
<p>Trombert, who, together with Fragerolle, Goudezki, and Marcel  Lefevre, had just ended an artistic voyage in the south of  France, opened the &quot;4 z&#x27;Arts,&quot; to which the novelty-loving  public quickly found its way, crowding to applaud Coquelin  CADET, Fragson, and other budding celebrities.  It was here  that the poets first had the idea of producing a piece in  which rival CABARETS were reviewed and laughingly criticised.   The success was beyond all precedent, in spite of the  difficulty of giving a play without a stage, without scenery  or accessories of any kind, the interest centring in the  talent with which the lines were declaimed by their authors,  who next had the pleasant thought of passing in review the  different classes of popular songs, Clovis Hugues, at the same  time poet and statesman, discoursing on each subject, and  introducing the singer; Brittany local songs, Provencal  ballads, ant the half Spanish, half French CHANSONS of the  Pyrenees were sung or recited by local poets with the charm  and abandon of their distinctive races.</p>
<p>The great critics did not disdain to attend these informal  gatherings, nor to write columns of serious criticism on the  subject in their papers.</p>
<p>At the hour when all Paris takes its APERITIF the &quot;4 z&#x27;Arts&quot;  became the meeting-place of the painters, poets, and writers  of the day.  Montmartre gradually replaced the old Latin  Quarter; it is there to-day that one must seek for the gayety  and humor, the pathos and the makeshifts of Bohemia.</p>
<p>The &quot;4 z&#x27;Arts,&quot; next to the &quot;Chat Noir,&quot; has had the greatest  influence on the taste of our time, - the pleiad of poets that  grouped themselves around it in the beginning, dispersing  later to form other centres, which, in their turn, were to  influence the minds and moods of thousands.</p>
<p>Another charming form of entertainment inaugurated by this  group of men is that of &quot;shadow pictures,&quot; conceived  originally by Caran d&#x27;Ache, and carried by him to a marvellous  perfection.  A medium-sized frame filled with ground glass is  suspended at one end of a room and surrounded by sombre  draperies.  The room is darkened; against the luminous  background of the glass appear small black groups (shadows  cast by figures cut out of cardboard).  These figures move,  advancing and retreating, grouping or separating themselves to  the cadence of the poet&#x27;s verses, for which they form the most  original and striking illustrations.  Entire poems are given  accompanied by these shadow pictures.</p>
<p>One of Caran d&#x27;Ache&#x27;s greatest successes in this line was an  EPOPEE DE NAPOLEON, - the great Emperor appearing on foot and  on horseback, the long lines of his army passing before him in  the foreground or small in the distance.  They stormed  heights, cheered on by his presence, or formed hollow squares  to repulse the enemy.  During their evolutions, the clear  voice of the poet rang out from the darkness with thrilling  effect.</p>
<p>The nicest art is necessary to cut these little figures to the  required perfection.  So great was the talent of their  inventor that, when he gave burlesques of the topics of the  day, or presented the celebrities of the hour to his public,  each figure would be recognized with a burst of delighted  applause.  The great Sarah was represented in poses of  infinite humor, surrounded by her menagerie or receiving the  homage of the universe.  Political leaders, foreign  sovereigns, social and operatic stars, were made to pass  before a laughing public.  None were spared.  Paris went mad  with delight at this new &quot;art,&quot; and for months it was  impossible to find a seat vacant in the hall.</p>
<p>At the Boite a Musique, the idea was further developed.  By an  ingenious arrangement of lights, of which the secret has been  carefully kept, landscapes are represented in color; all the  gradations of light are given, from the varied twilight hues  to purple night, until the moon, rising, lights anew the  picture.  During all these variations of color little groups  continue to come and go, acting out the story of a poem, which  the poet delivers from the surrounding obscurity as only an  author can render his own lines.</p>
<p>One of the pillars of this attractive centre was Jules Jouy,  who made a large place for himself in the hearts of his  contemporaries - a true poet, whom neither privations nor the  difficult beginnings of an unknown writer could turn from his  vocation.  His songs are alternately tender, gay, and bitingly  sarcastic.  Some of his better-known ballads were written for  and marvellously interpreted by Yvette Guilbert.  The  difficult critics, Sarcey and Jules Lemaitre, have sounded his  praise again and again.</p>
<p>A CABARET of another kind which enjoyed much celebrity, more  on account of the personality of the poet who founded it than  from any originality or picturesqueness in its intallation,  was the &quot;Mirliton,&quot; opened by Aristide Bruant in the little  rooms that had sheltered the original &quot;Chat Noir.&quot;</p>
<p>To give an account of the &quot;Mirliton&quot; is to tell the story of  Bruant, the most popular ballad-writer in France to-day.  This  original and eccentric poet is as well-known to a Parisian as  the boulevards or the Arc de Triomphe.  His costume of shabby  black velvet, Brittany waistcoat, red shirt, top-boots, and  enormous hat is a familiar feature in the caricatures and  prints of the day.  His little CABARET remains closed during  the day, opening its doors toward evening.  The personality of  the ballad-writer pervades the atmosphere.  He walks about the  tiny place hailing his acquaintances with some gay epigram,  receiving strangers with easy familiarity or chilling disdain,  as the humor takes him; then in a moment, with a rapid change  of expression, pouring out the ringing lines of one of his  ballads - always the story of the poor and humble, for he has  identified himself with the outcast and the disinherited.  His  volumes DANS LA RUE and SUR LA ROUTE have had an enormous  popularity, their contents being known and sung all over  France.</p>
<p>In 1892 Bruant was received as a member of the society of GENS  DE LETTRES.  It may be of interest to recall a part of the  speech made by Francois Coppee on the occasion: &quot;It is with  the greatest pleasure that I present to my confreres my good  friend, the ballad-writer, Aristide Bruant.  I value highly  the author of DANS LA RUE.  When I close his volume of sad and  caustic verses it is with the consoling thought that even vice  and crime have their conscience: that if there is suffering  there is a possible redemption.  He has sought his inspiration  in the gutter, it is true, but he has seen there a reflection  of the stars.&quot;</p>
<p>In the Avenue Trudaine, not far from the other CABARETS, the  &quot;Ane Rouge&quot; was next opened, in a quiet corner of the immense  suburb, its shady-little garden, on which the rooms open,  making it a favorite meeting-place during the warm months.  Of  a summer evening no more congenial spot can be found in all  Paris.  The quaint chambers have been covered with mural  paintings or charcoal caricatures of the poets themselves, or  of familiar faces among the clients and patrons of the place.</p>
<p>One of the many talents that clustered around this quiet  little garden was the brilliant Paul Verlaine, the most  Bohemian of all inhabitants of modern Prague, whose death has  left a void, difficult to fill.  Fame and honors came too  late.  He died in destitution, if not absolutely of hunger;  to-day his admirers are erecting a bronze bust of him in the  Garden of the Luxembourg, with money that would have gone far  toward making his life happy.</p>
<p>In the old hotel of the Lesdiguieres family, rue de la Tour  d&#x27;Auvergne, the &quot;Carillon&quot; opened its doors in 1893, and  quickly conquered a place in the public favor, the inimitable  fun and spirits of Tiercy drawing crowds to the place.</p>
<p>The famous &quot;Treteau de Tabarin,&quot; which today holds undisputed  precedence over all the CABARETS of Paris, was among the last  to appear.  It was founded by the brilliant Fursy and a group  of his friends.  Here no pains have been spared to form a  setting worthy of the poets and their public.</p>
<p>Many years ago, in the days of the good king Louis XIII., a  strolling poet-actor, Tabarin, erected his little canvas- covered stage before the statue of Henry IV., on the Pont- Neuf, and drew the court and the town by his fun and pathos.   The founders of the latest and most complete of Parisian  CABARETS have reconstructed, as far as possible, this historic  scene.  On the wall of the room where the performances are  given, is painted a view of old Paris, the Seine and its  bridges, the towers of Notre Dame in the distance, and the  statue of Louis XIII.&#x27;s warlike father in the foreground.  In  front of this painting stands a staging of rough planks,  reproducing the little theatre of Tabarin.  Here, every  evening, the authors and poets play in their own pieces,  recite their verses, and tell their stories.  Not long ago a  young musician, who has already given an opera to the world,  sang an entire one-act operetta of his composition, changing  his voice for the different parts, imitating choruses by  clever effects on the piano.</p>
<p>Montmartre is now sprinkled with attractive CABARETS, the  taste of the public for such informal entertainments having  grown each year; with reason, for the careless grace of the  surroundings, the absence of any useless restraint or  obligation as to hour or duration, has a charm for thousands  whom a long concert or the inevitable five acts at the  Francais could not tempt.  It would be difficult to overrate  the influence such an atmosphere, breathed in youth, must have  on the taste and character.  The absence of a sordid spirit,  the curse of our material day and generation, the contact with  intellects trained to incase their thoughts in serried verse  or crisp and lucid prose, cannot but form the hearer&#x27;s mind  into a higher and better mould.  It is both a satisfaction and  a hope for the future to know that these influences are being  felt all over the capital and throughout the length and  breadth of France.  There are at this moment in Paris alone  three or four hundred poets, ballad writers, and RACONTEURS  who recite their works in public.</p>
<p>It must be hard for the untravelled Anglo-Saxon to grasp the  idea that a poet can, without loss of prestige, recite his  lines in a public CAFE before a mixed audience.  If such  doubting souls could, however, be present at one of these  NOCTES AMBROSIANAE, they would acknowledge that the Latin  temperament can throw a grace and child-like abandon around an  act that would cause an Englishman or an American to appear  supremely ridiculous.  One&#x27;s taste and sense of fitness are  never shocked.  It seems the most natural thing in the world  to be sitting with your glass of beer before you, while some  rising poet, whose name ten years later may figure among the  &quot;Immortal Forty,&quot; tells to you his loves and his ambition, or  brings tears into your eyes with a description of some humble  hero or martyr.</p>
<p>From the days of Homer poetry has been the instructor of  nations.  In the Orient to-day the poet story-teller holds his  audience spellbound for hours, teaching the people their  history and supplying their minds with food for thought,  raising them above the dull level of the brutes by the charm  of his verse and the elevation of his ideas.  The power of  poetry is the same now as three thousand years ago.  Modern  skeptical Paris, that scoffs at all creeds and chafes  impatiently under any rule, will sit to-day docile and  complaisant, charmed by the melody of a poet&#x27;s voice; its  passions lulled or quickened, like Alexander&#x27;s of old, at the  will of a modern Timotheus.</p>
<p>Chapter 17 - Etiquette At Home and Abroad</p>
<p>READING that a sentinel had been punished the other day at St.  Petersburg for having omitted to present arms, as her Imperial  Highness, the Grand Duchess Olga, was leaving the winter  palace - in her nurse&#x27;s arms - I smiled at what appeared to be  needless punctilio; then, as is my habit, began turning the  subject over, and gradually came to the conclusion that while  it could doubtless be well to suppress much of the ceremonial  encumbering court life, it might not be amiss if we engrafted  a little more etiquette into our intercourse with strangers  and the home relations.  In our dear free and easy-going  country there is a constant tendency to loosen the ties of  fireside etiquette until any manners are thought good enough,  as any toilet is considered sufficiently attractive for home  use.  A singular impression has grown up that formal  politeness and the saying of gracious and complimentary things  betray the toady and the hypocrite, both if whom are abhorrent  to Americans.</p>
<p>By the force of circumstances most people are civil enough in  general society; while many fail to keep to their high  standard in the intimacy of home life and in their intercourse  with inferiors, which is a pity, as these are the two cases  where self-restraint and amenity are most required.   Politeness is, after all, but the dictate of a kind heart, and  supplies the oil necessary to make the social machinery run  smoothly.  In home life, which is the association during many  hours each day of people of varying dispositions, views, and  occupations, friction is inevitable; and there is especial  need of lubrication to lessen the wear and tear and eliminate  jarring.</p>
<p>Americans are always much shocked to learn that we are not  popular on the Continent.  Such a discovery comes to either a  nation or an individual like a douche of cold water on nice,  warm conceit, and brings with it a feeling of discouragement,  of being unjustly treated, that is painful, for we are very  &quot;touchy&quot; in America, and cry out when a foreigner expresses  anything but admiration for our ways, yet we are the last to  lend ourselves to foreign customs.</p>
<p>It has been a home thrust for many of us to find that our dear  friends the French sympathized warmly with Spain in the recent  struggle, and had little but sneers for us.  One of the  reasons for this partiality is not hard to discover.</p>
<p>The Spanish who travel are mostly members of an aristocracy  celebrated for its grave courtesy, which has gone a long way  toward making them popular on the Continent, while we have for  years been riding rough-shod over the feelings and prejudices  of the European peoples, under the pleasing but fallacious  illusion that the money we spent so lavishly in foreign lands  would atone for all our sins.  The large majority of our  travelling compatriots forget that an elaborate etiquette  exists abroad regulating the intercourse between one class and  another, the result of centuries of civilization, and as the  Medic and Persian laws for durability.  In our ignorance we  break many of these social laws and give offence where none  was intended.</p>
<p>A single illustration will explain my meaning.  A young  American girl once went to the mistress of a PENSION where she  was staying and complained that the CONCIERGE of the house had  been impertinent.  When the proprietress asked the CONCIERGE  what this meant, the latter burst out with her wrongs.  &quot;Since  Miss B. has been in this house, she has never once bowed to  me, or addressed a word to either my husband or myself that  was not a question or an order; she walks in and out of my  LOGE to look for letters or take her key as though my room  were the street; I won&#x27;t stand such treatment from any one,  much less from a girl.  The duchess who lives AU QUATRIEME  never passes without a kind word or an inquiry after the  children or my health.&quot;</p>
<p>Now this American girl had erred through ignorance of the fact  that in France servants are treated as humble friends.  The  man who brings your matutinal coffee says &quot;Good morning&quot; on  entering the room, and inquires if &quot;Monsieur has slept well,&quot;  expecting to be treated with the same politeness he shows to  you.</p>
<p>The lady who sits at the CAISSE of the restaurant you frequent  is as sure of her position as her customers are of theirs, and  exacts a courteous salutation from every one entering or  leaving her presence; logically, for no gentleman would enter  a ladies&#x27; drawing-room without removing his hat.  The fact  that a woman is obliged to keep a shop in no way relieves him  of this obligation.</p>
<p>People on the Continent know their friends&#x27; servants by name,  and speak to them on arriving at a house, and thank them for  an opened door or offered coat; if a tip is given it is  accompanied by a gracious word.  So rare is this form of  civility in America and England (for Britons err as gravely in  this matter as ourselves) that our servants are surprised and  inclined to resent politeness, as in the case of an English  butler who recently came to his master and said he should be  &quot;obliged to leave.&quot;  On being questioned it came out that one  of the guests was in the habit of chatting with him, &quot;and,&quot;  added the Briton, &quot;I won&#x27;t stand being took liberties with by  no one.&quot;</p>
<p>Some years ago I happened to be standing in the vestibule of  the Hotel Bristol as the Princess of Wales and her daughters  were leaving.  Mr. Morlock, the proprietor, was at the foot of  the stairs to take leave of those ladies, who shook hands with  and thanked him for his attention during their stay, and for  the flowers he had sent.  Nothing could have been more  gracious and freer from condescension than their manner, and  it undoubtedly produced the best impression.  The waiter who  served me at that time was also under their charm, and  remarked several times that &quot;there had never been ladies so  easy to please or so considerate of the servants.&quot;</p>
<p>My neighbor at dinner the other evening confided to me that  she was &quot;worn out being fitted.&quot;  &quot;I had such an unpleasant  experience this morning,&quot; she added.  &quot;The JUPIERE could not  get one of my skirts to hang properly.  After a dozen attempts  I told her to send for the forewoman, when, to my horror, the  girl burst out crying, and said she should lose her place if I  did.  I was very sorry for her, but what else could I do?&quot;  It  does not seem as if that lady could be very popular with  inferiors, does it?</p>
<p>That it needs a lighter hand and more tact to deal with  tradespeople than with equals is certain, and we are sure to  be the losers when we fail.  The last time I was in the East a  friend took me into the bazaars to see a carpet he was anxious  to buy.  The price asked was out of all proportion to its  value, but we were gravely invited by the merchant to be  seated and coffee was served, that bargaining (which is the  backbone of Oriental trade) might be carried on at leisure.   My friend, nervous and impatient, like all our race, turned to  me and said, &quot;What&#x27;s all this tomfoolery?  Tell him I&#x27;ll give  so much for his carpet; he can take it or leave it.&quot;  When  this was interpreted to the bearded tradesman, he smiled and  came down a few dollars in his price, and ordered more coffee.   By this time we were outside his shop, and left without the  carpet simply because my friend could not conform to the  customs of the country he was visiting.  The sale of his  carpet was a big affair for the Oriental; he intended to carry  it through with all the ceremony the occasion required, and  would sooner not make a sale than be hustled out of his  stately routine.</p>
<p>It is not only in intercourse with inferiors that tact is  required.  The treatment of children and young people in a  family calls for delicate handling.  The habit of taking  liberties with young relations is a common form of a relaxed  social code and the besetting sin of elderly people, who,  having little to interest them in their own lives, imagine  that their mission is to reform the ways and manners of their  family.  Ensconced behind the respect which the young are  supposed to pay them, they give free vent to inclination, and  carp, cavil, and correct.  The victims may have reached  maturity or even middle age, but remain always children to  these social policemen, to be reproved and instructed in and  out of season.  &quot;I am doing this for your own good,&quot; is an  excuse that apparently frees the veterans from the necessity  of respecting the prejudices and feelings of their pupils, and  lends a gloss of unselfishness to actions which are simply  impertinent.  Oddly enough, amateur &quot;schoolmarms&quot; who fall  into this unpleasant habit are generally oversensitive, and  resent as a personal affront any restlessness under criticism  on the part of their victims.  It is easy, once the habit is  acquired, to carry the suavity and consideration of general  society into the home circle, yet how often is it done?  I  should like to see the principle that ordered presentation of  arms to the infant princess applied to our intimate relations,  and the rights of the young and dependent scrupulously  respected.</p>
<p>In the third act of CASTE, when old Eccles steals the &quot;coral&quot;  from his grandson&#x27;s neck, he excuses the theft by a  grandiloquent soliloquy, and persuades himself that he is  protecting &quot;the weak and the humble&quot; (pointing to himself)  &quot;against the powerful and the strong&quot; (pointing to the baby).   Alas, too many of us take liberties with those whom we do not  fear, and excuse our little acts of cowardice with arguments  as fallacious as those of drunken old Eccles.</p>
<p>Chapter 18 - What is &quot;Art&quot;?</p>
<p>IN former years, we inquiring youngsters in foreign studios  were much bewildered by the repetition of a certain phrase.   Discussion of almost any picture or statue was (after other  forms of criticism had been exhausted) pretty sure to conclude  with, &quot;It&#x27;s all very well in its way, but it&#x27;s not Art.&quot;  Not  only foolish youths but the &quot;masters&quot; themselves constantly  advanced this opinion to crush a rival or belittle a friend.   To ardent minds seeking for the light and catching at every  thread that might serve as a guide out of perplexity, this  vague assertion was confusing.  According to one master, the  eighteenth-century &quot;school&quot; did not exist.  What had been  produced at that time was pleasing enough to the eye, but &quot;was  not Art!&quot;  In the opinion of another, Italian music might  amuse or cheer the ignorant, but could not be recognized by  serious musicians.</p>
<p>As most of us were living far from home and friends for the  purpose of acquiring the rudiments of art, this continual  sweeping away of our foundations was discouraging.  What was  the use, we sometimes asked ourselves, of toiling, if our work  was to be cast contemptuously aside by the next &quot;school&quot; as a  pleasing trifle, not for a moment to be taken seriously?  How  was one to find out the truth?  Who was to decide when doctors  disagreed?  Where was the rock on which an earnest student  might lay his cornerstone without the misgiving that the next  wave in public opinion would sap its base and cast him and his  ideals out again at sea?</p>
<p>The eighteenth-century artists and the Italian composers had  been sincere and convinced that they were producing works of  art.  In our own day the idol of one moment becomes the jest  of the next.  Was there, then, no fixed law?</p>
<p>The short period, for instance, between 1875 and the present  time has been long enough for the talent of one painter  (Bastien-Lepage) to be discovered, discussed, lauded,  acclaimed, then gradually forgotten and decried.  During the  years when we were studying in Paris, that young painter&#x27;s  works were pronounced by the critics and their following to be  the last development of Art.  Museums and amateurs vied with  each other in acquiring his canvases.  Yet, only this spring,  while dining with two or three art critics in the French  capital, I heard Lepage&#x27;s name mentioned and his works  recalled with the smile that is accorded to those who have  hoodwinked the public and passed off spurious material as the  real thing.</p>
<p>If any one doubts the fleeting nature of a reputation, let him  go to a sale of modern pictures and note the prices brought by  the favorites of twenty years ago.  The paintings of that  arch-priest, Meissonier, no longer command the sums that eager  collectors paid for them a score of years back.  When a great  European critic dares assert, as one has recently, of the  master&#x27;s &quot;1815,&quot; that &quot;everything in the picture appears  metallic, except the cannon and the men&#x27;s helmets,&quot; the mighty  are indeed fallen!  It is much the same thing with the old  masters.  There have been fashions in them as in other forms  of art.  Fifty years ago Rembrandt&#x27;s work brought but small  prices, and until Henri Rochefort (during his exile) began to  write up the English school, Romneys, Lawrences, and  Gainsboroughs had little market value.</p>
<p>The result is that most of us are as far away from the  solution of that vexed question &quot;What is Art?&quot; at forty as we  were when boys.  The majority have arranged a compromise with  their consciences.  We have found out what we like (in itself  no mean achievement), and beyond such personal preference, are  shy of asserting (as we were fond of doing formerly) that such  and such works are &quot;Art,&quot; and such others, while pleasing and  popular, lack the requisite qualities.</p>
<p>To enquiring minds, sure that an answer to this question  exists, but uncertain where to look for it, the fact that one  of the thinkers of the century has, in a recent &quot;Evangel,&quot;  given to the world a definition of &quot;Art,&quot; the result of many  years&#x27; meditation, will be received with joy.  &quot;Art,&quot; says  Tolstoi, &quot;is simply a condition of life.  It is any form of  expression that a human being employs to communicate an  emotion he has experienced to a fellow-mortal.&quot;</p>
<p>An author who, in telling his hopes and sorrows, amuses or  saddens a reader, has in just so much produced a work of art.   A lover who, by the sincerity of his accent, communicates the  flame that is consuming him to the object of his adoration;  the shopkeeper who inspires a purchaser with his own  admiration for an object on sale; the baby that makes its joy  known to a parent - artists! artists!  Brown, Jones, or  Robinson, the moment he has consciously produced on a  neighbor&#x27;s ear or eye the sensation that a sound or a  combination of colors has effected on his own organs, is an  artist!</p>
<p>Of course much of this has been recognized through all time.   The formula in which Tolstoi has presented his meditations to  the world is, however, so fresh that it comes like a  revelation, with the additional merit of being understood,  with little or no mental effort, by either the casual reader,  who, with half-attention attracted by a headline, says to  himself, &quot;`What is art?&#x27;  That looks interesting!&quot; and skims  lightly down the lines, or the thinker who, after perusing  Tolstoi&#x27;s lucid words, lays down the volume with a sigh, and  murmurs in his humiliation, &quot;Why have I been all these years  seeking in the clouds for what was lying ready at my hand?&quot;</p>
<p>The wide-reaching definition of the Russian writer has the  effect of a vigorous blow from a pickaxe at the foundations of  a shaky and too elaborate edifice.  The wordy superstructure  of aphorisms and paradox falls to the ground, disclosing fair  &quot;Truth,&quot; so long a captive within the temple erected in her  honor.  As, however, the newly freed goddess smiles on the  ignorant and the pedants alike, the result is that with one  accord the aesthetes raise a howl!  &quot;And the <code>beautiful,&#x27;&quot;  they say, &quot;the beautiful?  Can there be any </code>Art&#x27; without the  <code>Beautiful&#x27;?  What! the little greengrocer at the corner is an  artist because, forsooth, he has arranged some lettuce and  tomatoes into a tempting pile!  Anathema!  Art is a secret  known only to the initiated few; the vulgar can neither  understand nor appreciate it!  We are the elect!  Our mission  is to explain what Art is and point out her beauty to a coarse  and heedless world.  Only those with a sense of the  </code>beautiful&#x27; should be allowed to enter into her sacred  presence.&quot;</p>
<p>Here the expounders of &quot;Art&quot; plunge into a sea of words,  offering a dozen definitions each more obscure than its  predecessor, all of which have served in turn as watchwords of  different &quot;schools.&quot;  Tolstoi&#x27;s sweeping truth is too far- reaching to please these gentry.  Like the priests of past  religions, they would have preferred to keep such knowledge as  they had to themselves and expound it, little at a time, to  the ignorant.  The great Russian has kicked away their altar  and routed the false gods, whose acolytes will never forgive  him.</p>
<p>Those of my readers who have been intimate with painters,  actors, or musicians, will recall with amusement how lightly  the performances of an associate are condemned by the  brotherhood as falling short of the high standard which  according to these wiseacres, &quot;Art&quot; exacts, and how sure each  speaker is of understanding just where a brother carries his  &quot;mote.&quot;</p>
<p>Voltaire once avoided giving a definition of the beautiful by  saying, &quot;Ask a toad what his ideas of beauty are.  He will  indicate the particular female toad he happens to admire and  praise her goggle-eyes and yellow belly as the perfection of  beauty!&quot;  A negro from Guiana will make much the same  unsatisfactory answer, so the old philosopher recommends us  not to be didactic on subjects where judgments are relative,  and at the same time without appeal.</p>
<p>Tolstoi denies that an idea as subtle as a definition of Art  can be classified by pedants, and proceeds to formulate the  following delightful axiom: &quot;A principle upon which no two  people can agree does not exist.&quot;  A truth is proved by its  evidence to all.  Discussion outside of that is simply beating  the air.  Each succeeding &quot;school&quot; has sounded its death-knell  by asserting that certain combinations alone produced beauty -  the weakness of to-day being an inclination to see art only in  the obscure and the recondite.  As a result we drift each hour  further from the truth.  Modern intellectuality has formed  itself into a scornful aristocracy whose members, esteeming  themselves the elite, withdraw from the vulgar public, and  live in a world of their own, looking (like the Lady of  Shalott) into a mirror at distorted images of nature and  declaring that what they see is art!</p>
<p>In literature that which is difficult to understand is much  admired by the simple-minded, who also decry pictures that  tell their own story!  A certain class of minds enjoy being  mystified, and in consequence writers, painters, and musicians  have appeared who are willing to juggle for their amusement.   The simple definition given to us by the Russian writer comes  like a breath of wholesome air to those suffocating in an  atmosphere of perfumes and artificial heat.  Art is our common  inheritance, not the property of a favored few.  The wide  world we love is full of it, and each of us in his humble way  is an artist when with a full heart he communicates his  delight and his joy to another.  Tolstoi has given us back our  birthright, so long withheld, and crowned with his aged hands  the true artist.</p>
<p>Chapter 19 - The Genealogical Craze</p>
<p>THERE undoubtedly is something in the American temperament  that prevents our doing anything in moderation.  If we take up  an idea, it is immediately run to exaggeration and then  abandoned, that the nation may fly at a tangent after some new  fad.  Does this come from our climate, or (as I am inclined to  think) from the curiously unclassified state of society in our  country, where so few established standards exist and so few  are sure of their own or their neighbors&#x27; standing?  In  consequence, if Mrs. Brown starts anything, Mrs. Jones, for  fear of being left behind, immediately &quot;goes her one better&quot;  to be in turn &quot;raised&quot; by Mrs. Robinson.</p>
<p>In other lands a reasonable pride of birth has always been one  of the bonds holding communities together, and is estimated at  its just value.  We, after having practically ignored the  subject for half a century, suddenly rush to the other  extreme, and develop an entire forest of genealogical trees at  a growth.</p>
<p>Chagrined, probably, at the small amount of consideration that  their superior birth commanded, a number of aristocratically  minded matrons united a few years ago as &quot;Daughters of the  Revolution,&quot; restricting membership to women descended from  officers of Washington&#x27;s army.  There may have been a reason  for the formation of this society.  I say &quot;may&quot; because it  does not seem quite clear what its aim was.  The originators  doubtless imagined they were founding an exclusive circle, but  the numbers who clamored for admittance quickly dispelled this  illusion.  So a small group of the elect withdrew in disgust  and banded together under the cognomen of &quot;Colonial Dames.&quot;</p>
<p>The only result of these two movements was to awaken envy,  hatred, and malice in the hearts of those excluded from the  mysterious rites, which to outsiders seemed to consist in  blackballing as many aspirants as possible.  Some victims of  this bad treatment, thirsting for revenge, struck on the happy  thought of inaugurating an &quot;Aztec&quot; society.  As that title  conveyed absolutely no idea to any one, its members were  forced to explain that only descendants of officers who fought  in the Mexican War were eligible.  What the elect did when  they got into the circle was not specified.</p>
<p>The &quot;Social Order of Foreign Wars&quot; was the next creation, its  authors evidently considering the Mexican campaign as a  domestic article, a sort of family squabble.  Then the  &quot;Children of 1812&quot; attracted attention, both groups having  immediate success.  Indeed, the vogue of these enterprises has  been in inverse ratio to their usefulness or RAISON D&#x27;ETRE,  people apparently being ready to join anything rather than get  left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Jealous probably of seeing women enjoying all the fun, their  husbands and brothers next banded together as &quot;Sons of the  Revolution.&quot;  The wives retaliated by instituting the  &quot;Granddaughters of the Revolution&quot; and &quot;The Mayflower Order,&quot;  the &quot;price of admission&quot; to the latter being descent from some  one who crossed in that celebrated ship - whether as one of  the crew or as passenger is not clear.</p>
<p>It was not, however, in the American temperament to rest  content with modest beginnings, the national motto being, &quot;The  best is good enough for me.&quot;  So wind was quickly taken out of  the Mayflower&#x27;s sails by &quot;The Royal Order of the Crown,&quot; to  which none need apply who were not prepared to prove descent  from one or more royal ancestors.  It was not stated in the  prospectus whether Irish sovereigns and Fiji Island kings  counted, but I have been told that bar sinisters form a class  apart, and are deprived of the right to vote or hold office.</p>
<p>Descent from any old king was, however, not sufficient for the  high-toned people of our republic.  When you come to think of  it, such a circle might be &quot;mixed.&quot; One really must draw the  line somewhere (as the Boston parvenu replied when asked why  he had not invited his brother to a ball).  So the founders of  the &quot;Circle of Holland Dames of the New Netherlands&quot; drew the  line at descent from a sovereign of the Low Countries.  It  does not seem as if this could be a large society, although  those old Dutch pashas had an unconscionable number of  children.</p>
<p>The promoters of this enterprise seem nevertheless to have  been fairly successful, for they gave a fete recently and  crowned a queen.  To be acclaimed their sovereign by a group  of people all of royal birth is indeed an honor.  Rumors of  this ceremony have come to us outsiders.  It is said that they  employed only lineal descendants of Vatel to prepare their  banquet, and I am assured that an offspring of Gambrinus acted  as butler.</p>
<p>But it is wrong to joke on this subject.  The state of affairs  is becoming too serious.  When sane human beings form a  &quot;Baronial Order of Runnymede,&quot; and announce in their  prospectus that only descendants through the male line from  one (or more) of the forty noblemen who forced King John to  sign the Magna Charta are what our Washington Mrs. Malaprop  would call &quot;legible,&quot; the action attests a diseased condition  of the community.  Any one taking the trouble to remember that  eight of the original barons died childless, and that the Wars  of the Roses swept away nine tenths of what families the  others may have had, that only one man in England (Lord de  Ros) can at the present day PROVE male descent further back  than the eleventh century, must appreciate the absurdity of  our compatriots&#x27; pretensions.  Burke&#x27;s Peerage is acknowledged  to be the most &quot;faked&quot; volume in the English language, but the  descents it attributes are like mathematical demonstrations  compared to the &quot;trees&quot; that members of these new American  orders climb.</p>
<p>When my class was graduated from Mr. McMullen&#x27;s school, we  little boys had the brilliant idea of uniting in a society,  but were greatly put about for an effective name, hitting  finally upon that of Ancient Seniors&#x27; Society.  For a group of  infants, this must be acknowledged to have been a luminous  inspiration.  We had no valid reason for forming that society,  not being particularly fond of each other.  Living in several  cities, we rarely met after leaving school and had little to  say to each other when we did.  But it sounded so fine to be  an &quot;Ancient Senior,&quot; and we hoped in our next school to  impress new companions with that title and make them feel  proper respect for us in consequence.  Pride, however,  sustained a fall when it was pointed out that the initials  formed the ominous word &quot;Ass.&quot;</p>
<p>I have a shrewd suspicion that the motives which prompted our  youthful actions are not very different from those now  inciting children of a larger growth to band together,  blackball their friends, crown queens, and perform other  senseless mummeries, such as having the weathercock of a  departed meeting-house brought in during a banquet, and  dressing restaurant waiters in knickerbockers for &quot;one night  only.&quot;</p>
<p>This malarial condition of our social atmosphere accounts for  the quantity of genealogical quacks that have taken to sending  typewritten letters, stating that the interest they take in  your private affairs compels them to offer proof of your  descent from any crowned head to whom you may have taken a  fancy.  One correspondent assured me only this month that he  had papers in his possession showing beyond a doubt that I  might claim a certain King McDougal of Scotland for an  ancestor.  I have misgivings, however, as to the quality of  the royal blood in my veins, for the same correspondent was  equally confident six months ago that my people came in direct  line from Charlemagne.  As I have no desire to &quot;corner&quot; the  market in kings, these letters have remained unanswered.</p>
<p>Considering the mania to trace descent from illustrious men,  it astonishes me that a Mystic Band, consisting of lineal  descendants from the Seven Sages of Greece, has not before now  burst upon an astonished world.  It has been suggested that if  some one wanted to organize a truly restricted circle, &quot;The  Grandchildren of our Tripoli War&quot; would be an excellent title.   So few Americans took part in that conflict - and still fewer  know anything about it - that the satisfaction of joining the  society would be immense to exclusively-minded people.</p>
<p>There is only one explanation that seems in any way to account  for this vast tomfoolery.  A little sentence, printed at the  bottom of a prospectus recently sent to me, lets the ambitious  cat out of the genealogical bag.  It states that &quot;social  position is assured to people joining our order.&quot;  Thanks to  the idiotic habit some newspapers have inaugurated of  advertising, gratis, a number of self-elected society  &quot;leaders,&quot; many feeble-minded people, with more ambition than  cash, and a larger supply of family papers than brains, have  been bitten with a social madness, and enter these traps,  thinking they are the road to position and honors.  The number  of fools is larger than one would have believed possible, if  the success of so many &quot;orders,&quot; &quot;circles,&quot; &quot;commanderies,&quot;  and &quot;regencies&quot; were not there to testify to the unending  folly of the would-be &quot;smart.&quot;</p>
<p>This last decade of the century has brought to light many  strange fads and senseless manias.  This &quot;descent&quot; craze,  however, surpasses them all in inanity.  The keepers of insane  asylums will tell you that one of the hopeless forms of  madness is LA FOLIE DES GRANDEURS.  A breath of this delirium  seems to be blowing over our country.  Crowns and sceptres  haunt the dreams of simple republican men and women, troubling  their slumbers and leading them a will-o&#x27;-the-wisp dance back  across the centuries.</p>
<p>Chapter 20 - As the Twig is Bent</p>
<p>I KNEW, in my youth, a French village far up among the  Cevennes Mountains, where the one cultivated man of the place,  saddened by the unlovely lives of the peasants around him and  by the bare walls of the village school, organized evening  classes for the boys.  During these informal hours, he talked  to them of literature and art and showed them his prints and  paintings.  When the youths&#x27; interest was aroused he lent them  books, that they might read about the statues and buildings  that had attracted their attention.  At first it appeared a  hopeless task to arouse any interest among these peasants in  subjects not bearing on their abject lives.  To talk with boys  of the ideal, when their poor bodies were in need of food and  raiment, seemed superfluous; but in time the charm worked, as  it always will.  The beautiful appealed to their simple  natures, elevating and refining them, and opening before their  eager eyes perspectives of undreamed-of interest.  The self- imposed task became a delight as his pupils&#x27; minds responded  to his efforts.  Although death soon ended his useful life,  the seed planted grew and bore fruit in many humble homes.</p>
<p>At this moment I know men in several walks of life who revere  with touching devotion the memory of the one human being who  had brought to them, at the moment when they were most  impressionable, the gracious message that existence was not  merely a struggle for bread.  The boys he had gathered around  him realize now that the encouragement and incentive received  from those evening glimpses of noble works existing in the  world was the mainspring of their subsequent development and a  source of infinite pleasure through all succeeding years.</p>
<p>This reference to an individual effort toward cultivating the  poor has been made because other delicate spirits are  attempting some such task in our city, where quite as much as  in the French village schoolchildren stand in need of some  message of beauty in addition to the instruction they receive,  - some window opened for them, as it were, upon the fields of  art, that their eyes when raised from study or play may rest  on objects more inspiring than blank walls and the graceless  surroundings of street or schoolroom.</p>
<p>We are far too quick in assuming that love of the beautiful is  confined to the highly educated; that the poor have no desire  to surround themselves with graceful forms and harmonious  colors.  We wonder at and deplore their crude standards,  bewailing the general lack of taste and the gradual reducing  of everything to a commonplace money basis.  We smile at the  efforts toward adornment attempted by the poor, taking it too  readily for granted that on this point they are beyond  redemption.  This error is the less excusable as so little has  been done by way of experiment before forming an opinion, -  whole classes being put down as inferior beings, incapable of  appreciation, before they have been allowed even a glimpse of  the works of art that form the daily mental food of their  judges.</p>
<p>The portly charlady who rules despotically in my chambers is  an example.  It has been a curious study to watch her growing  interest in the objects that have here for the first time come  under her notice; the delight she has come to take in dusting  and arranging my belongings, and her enthusiasm at any new  acquisition.  Knowing how bare her own home was, I felt at  first only astonishment at her vivid interest in what seemed  beyond her comprehension, but now realize that in some blind  way she appreciates the rare and the delicate quite as much as  my more cultivated visitors.  At the end of one laborious  morning, when everything was arranged to her satisfaction, she  turned to me her poor, plain face, lighted up with an  expression of delight, and exclaimed, &quot;Oh, sir, I do love to  work in these rooms!  I&#x27;m never so happy as when I&#x27;m arranging  them elegant things!&quot;  And, although my pleasure in her  pleasure was modified by the discovery that she had taken an  eighteenth-century comb to disentangle the fringes of a rug,  and broken several of its teeth in her ardor, that she  invariably placed a certain Whister etching upside down, and  then stood in rapt admiration before it, still, in watching  her enthusiasm, I felt a thrill of satisfaction at seeing how  her untaught taste responded to a contact with good things.</p>
<p>Here in America, and especially in our city, which we have  been at such pains to make as hideous as possible, the  schoolrooms, where hundreds of thousands of children pass many  hours daily, are one degree more graceless than the town  itself; the most artistically inclined child can hardly  receive any but unfortunate impressions.  The other day a  friend took me severely to task for rating our American women  on their love of the big shops, and gave me, I confess, an  entirely new idea on the subject.  &quot;Can&#x27;t you see,&quot; she said,  &quot;that the shops here are what the museums abroad are to the  poor?  It is in them only that certain people may catch  glimpses of the dainty and exquisite manufactures of other  countries.  The little education their eyes receive is  obtained during visits to these emporiums.&quot;</p>
<p>If this proves so, and it seems probable, it only proves how  the humble long for something more graceful than their meagre  homes afford.</p>
<p>In the hope of training the younger generations to better  standards and less vulgar ideals, a group of ladies are making  an attempt to surround our schoolchildren during their  impressionable youth with reproductions of historic  masterpieces, and have already decorated many schoolrooms in  this way.  For a modest sum it is possible to tint the bare  walls an attractive color - a delight in itself - and adorn  them with plaster casts of statues and solar prints of  pictures and buildings.  The transformation that fifty or  sixty dollars judiciously expended in this way produces in a  school-room is beyond belief, and, as the advertisements say,  &quot;must be seen to be appreciated,&quot; giving an air of  cheerfulness and refinement to the dreariest apartment.</p>
<p>It is hard to make people understand the enthusiasm these  decorations have excited in both teachers and pupils.  The  directress of one of our large schools was telling me of the  help and pleasure the prints and casts had been to her; she  had given them as subjects for the class compositions, and  used them in a hundred different ways as object-lessons.  As  the children are graduated from room to room, a great variety  of high-class subjects can be brought to their notice by  varying the decorations.</p>
<p>It is by the eye principally that taste is educated.  &quot;We  speak with admiration of the eighth sense common among  Parisians, and envy them their magic power of combining simple  materials into an artistic whole.  The reason is that for  generations the eyes of those people have been unconsciously  educated by the harmonious lines of well-proportioned  buildings, finely finished detail of stately colonnade, and  shady perspective of quay and boulevard.  After years of this  subtle training the eye instinctively revolts from the vulgar  and the crude.  There is little in the poorer quarters of our  city to rejoice or refine the senses; squalor and all- pervading ugliness are not least among the curses that poverty  entails.</p>
<p>If you have a subject of interest in your mind, it often  happens that every book you open, every person you speak with,  refers to that topic.  I never remember having seen an  explanation offered of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>The other morning, while this article was lying half finished  on my desk, I opened the last number of a Paris paper and  began reading an account of the drama, LES MAUVAIS BERGERS  (treating of that perilous subject, the &quot;strikes&quot;), which  Sarah Bernhardt had just had the courage to produce before the  Paris public.  In the third act, when the owner of the factory  receives the disaffected hands, and listens to their  complaints, the leader of the strike (an intelligent young  workman), besides shorter hours and increased pay, demands  that recreation rooms be built where the toilers, their wives,  and their children may pass unoccupied hours in the enjoyment  of attractive surroundings, and cries in conclusion: &quot;We, the  poor, need some poetry and some art in our lives, man does not  live by bread alone.  He has a right, like the rich, to things  of beauty!&quot;</p>
<p>In commending the use of decoration as a means of bringing  pleasure into dull, cramped lives, one is too often met by the  curious argument that taste is innate.  &quot;Either people have it  or they haven&#x27;t,&quot; like a long nose or a short one, and it is  useless to waste good money in trying to improve either.  &quot;It  would be much more to the point to spend your money in giving  the poor children a good roast-beef dinner at Christmas than  in placing the bust of Clytie before them.&quot;  That argument has  crushed more attempts to elevate the poor than any other ever  advanced.  If it were listened to, there would never be any  progress made, because there are always thousands of people  who are hungry.</p>
<p>When we reflect how painfully ill-arranged rooms or ugly  colors affect our senses, and remember that less fortunate  neighbors suffer as much as we do from hideous environments,  it seems like keeping sunlight from a plant, or fresh air out  of a sick-room, to refuse glimpses of the beautiful to the  poor when it is in our power to give them this satisfaction  with a slight effort.  Nothing can be more encouraging to  those who occasionally despair of human nature than the good  results already obtained by this small attempt in the schools.</p>
<p>We fall into the error of imagining that because the Apollo  Belvedere and the Square of St. Mark&#x27;s have become stale to us  by reproduction they are necessarily so to others.  The great  and the wealthy of the world form no idea of the longing the  poor feel for a little variety in their lives.  They do not  know what they want.  They have no standards to guide them,  but the desire is there.  Let us offer ourselves the  satisfaction, as we start off for pleasure trips abroad or to  the mountains, of knowing that at home the routine of study is  lightened for thousands of children by the counterfeit  presentment of the scenes we are enjoying; that, as we float  up the Golden Horn or sit in the moonlight by the Parthenon,  far away at home some child is dreaming of those fair scenes  as she raises her eyes from her task, and is unconsciously  imbibing a love of the beautiful, which will add a charm to  her humble life, and make the present labors lighter.  If the  child never lives to see the originals, she will be happier  for knowing that somewhere in the world domed mosques mirror  themselves in still waters, and marble gods, the handiwork of  long-dead nations, stand in the golden sunlight and silently  preach the gospel of the beautiful.</p>
<p>Chapter 21 - Seven Small Duchesses</p>
<p>SINCE those &quot;precious&quot; days when the habitues of the Hotel  Rambouillet first raised social intercourse to the level of a  fine art, the morals and manners, the amusements and intrigues  of great French ladies have interested the world and  influenced the ways of civilized nations.  Thanks to Memoirs  and Maxims, we are able to reconstruct the life of a  seventeenth or eighteenth century noblewoman as completely as  German archeologists have rebuilt the temple of the Wingless  Victory on the Acropolis from surrounding debris.</p>
<p>Interest in French society has, however, diminished during  this century, ceasing almost entirely with the Second Empire,  when foreign women gave the tone to a parvenu court from which  the older aristocracy held aloof in disgust behind the closed  gates of their &quot;hotels&quot; and historic chateaux.</p>
<p>With the exception of Balzac, few writers have drawn authentic  pictures of nineteenth-century noblewomen in France; and his  vivid portrayals are more the creations of genius than correct  descriptions of a caste.</p>
<p>During the last fifty years French aristocrats have ceased to  be factors even in matters social, the sceptre they once held  having passed into alien hands, the daughters of Albion to a  great extent replacing their French rivals in influencing the  ways of the &quot;world,&quot; - a change, be it remarked in passing,  that has not improved the tone of society or contributed to  the spread of good manners.</p>
<p>People like the French nobles, engaged in sulking and  attempting to overthrow or boycott each succeeding regime,  must naturally lose their influence.  They have held aloof so  long - fearing to compromise themselves by any advances to the  powers that be, and restrained by countless traditions from  taking an active part in either the social or political strife  - that little by little they have been passed by and ignored;  which is a pity, for amid the ruin of many hopes and ambitions  they have remained true to their caste and handed down from  generation to generation the secret of that gracious urbanity  and tact which distinguished the Gallic noblewoman in the last  century from the rest of her kind and made her so deft in the  difficult art of pleasing - and being pleased.</p>
<p>Within the last few years there have, however, been signs of a  change.  Young members of historic houses show an amusing  inclination to escape from their austere surroundings and  resume the place their grandparents abdicated.  If it is  impossible to rule as formerly, they at any rate intend to get  some fun out of existence.</p>
<p>This joyous movement to the front is being made by the young  matrons enlisted under the &quot;Seven little duchesses&#x27;&quot; banner.   Oddly enough, a baker&#x27;s half-dozen of ducal coronets are worn  at this moment, in France, by small and sprightly women, who  have shaken the dust of centuries from those ornaments and  sport them with a decidedly modern air!</p>
<p>It is the members of this clique who, in Paris during the  spring, at their chateaux in the summer and autumn, and on the  Riviera after Christmas, lead the amusements and strike the  key for the modern French world.</p>
<p>No one of these light-hearted ladies takes any particular  precedence over the others.  All are young, and some are  wonderfully nice to look at.  The Duchesse d&#x27;Uzes is, perhaps,  the handsomest, good looks being an inheritance from her  mother, the beautiful and wayward Duchesse de Chaulme.</p>
<p>There is a vivid grace about the daughter, an intense vitality  that suggests some beautiful being of the forest.  As she  moves and speaks one almost expects to hear the quick breath  coming and going through her quivering nostrils, and see foam  on her full lips.  Her mother&#x27;s tragic death has thrown a  glamor of romance around the daughter&#x27;s life that heightens  the witchery of her beauty.</p>
<p>Next in good looks comes an American, the Duchesse de la  Rochefoucauld, although marriage (which, as de Maupassant  remarked, is rarely becoming) has not been propitious to that  gentle lady.  By rights she should have been mentioned first,  as her husband outranks, not only all the men of his age, but  also his cousin, the old Duc de la Rochefoucauld-Doudeauville,  to whom, however, a sort of brevet rank is accorded on account  of his years, his wealth, and the high rank of his two wives.   It might almost be asserted that our fair compatriot wears the  oldest coronet in France.  She certainly is mistress of three  of the finest chateaux in that country, among which is  Miromail, where the family live, and Liancourt, a superb  Renaissance structure, a delight to the artist&#x27;s soul.</p>
<p>The young Duchesse de Brissac runs her two comrades close as  regards looks.  Brissac is the son of Mme. de Tredern, whom  Newporters will remember two years ago, when she enjoyed some  weeks of our summer season.  Their chateau was built by the  Brissac of Henri IV.&#x27;s time and is one of the few that escaped  uninjured through the Revolution, its vast stone corridors and  massive oak ceilings, its moat and battlements, standing to- day unimpaired amid a group of chateaux including Chaumont,  Rochecotte, Azay-le-Rideau, Usse, Chenonceau, within &quot;dining&quot;  distance of each other, that form a centre of gayety next in  importance to Paris and Cannes.  In the autumn these spacious  castles are filled with joyous bands and their ample stables  with horses.  A couple of years ago, when the king of Portugal  and his suite were entertained at Chaumont for a week of stag- hunting, over three hundred people, servants, and guests,  slept under its roof, and two hundred horses were housed in  its stables.</p>
<p>The Duc de Luynes and his wife, who was Mlle. de Crussol  (daughter of the brilliant Duchesse d&#x27;Uzes of Boulanger fame),  live at Dampierre, another interesting pile filled with rare  pictures, bric-a-brac, and statuary, first among which is Jean  Goujon&#x27;s life-sized statue (in silver) of Louis XIII.,  presented by that monarch to his favorite, the founder of the  house.  This gem of the Renaissance stands in an octagonal  chamber hung in dark velvet, unique among statues.  It has  been shown but once in public, at the Loan Exhibition in 1872,  when the patriotic nobility lent their treasures to collect a  fund for the Alsace-Lorraine exiles.</p>
<p>The Duchesse de Noailles, NEE Mlle. de Luynes, is another of  this coterie and one of the few French noblewomen who has  travelled.  Many Americans will remember the visit she made  here with her mother some years ago, and the effect her  girlish grace produced at that time.  The de Noailles&#x27; chateau  of Maintenon is an inheritance from Louis XIV.&#x27;s prudish  favorite, who founded and enriched the de Noailles family.   The Duc and Duchesse d&#x27;Uzes live near by at Bonnelle with the  old Duc de Doudeauville, her grandfather, who is also the  grandfather of Mme. de Noailles, these two ladies being  descended each from a wife of the old duke, the former from  the Princesse de Polignac and the latter from the Princesse de  Ligne.</p>
<p>The Duchesse de Bisaccia, NEE Princesse Radziwill, and the  Duchesse d&#x27;Harcourt, who complete the circle of seven, also  live in this vicinity, where another group of historic  residences, including Eclimont and Rambouillet, the summer  home of the president, rivals in gayety and hospitality the  chateaux of the Loire.</p>
<p>No coterie in England or in this country corresponds at all to  this French community.  Much as they love to amuse themselves,  the idea of meeting any but their own set has never passed  through their well-dressed heads.  They differ from their  parents in that they have broken away from many antiquated  habits.  Their houses are no longer lay hermitages, and their  opera boxes are regularly filled, but no foreigner is ever  received, no ambitious parvenu accepted among them.  Ostracism  here means not a ten years&#x27; exile, but lifelong banishment.</p>
<p>The contrast is strong between this rigor and the enthusiasm  with which wealthy new-comers are welcomed into London society  or by our own upper crust, so full of unpalatable pieces of  dough.  This exclusiveness of the titled French reminds me -  incongruously enough - of a certain arrangement of graves in a  Lenox cemetery, where the members of an old New England family  lie buried in a circle with their feet toward its centre.   When I asked, many years ago, the reason for this arrangement,  a wit of that day - a daughter, by the bye, of Mrs. Stowe -  replied, &quot;So that when they rise at the Last Day only members  of their own family may face them!&quot;</p>
<p>One is struck by another peculiarity of these French men and  women - their astonishing proficiency in LES ARTS D&#x27;AGREMENT.   Every Frenchwoman of any pretensions to fashion backs her  beauty and grace with some art in which she is sure to be  proficient.  The dowager Duchesse d&#x27;Uzes is a sculptor of  mark, and when during the autumn Mme. de Tredern gives opera  at Brissac, she finds little difficulty in recruiting her  troupe from among the youths and maidens under her roof whose  musical education has been thorough enough to enable them to  sing difficult music in public.</p>
<p>Love of the fine arts is felt in their conversation, in the  arrangement and decoration of their homes, and in the interest  that an exhibition of pictures or old furniture will excite.   Few of these people but are HABITUES of the Hotel Drouot and  conversant with the value and authenticity of the works of art  daily sold there.  Such elements combine to form an atmosphere  that does not exist in any other country, and lends an  interest to society in France which it is far from possessing  elsewhere.</p>
<p>There is but one way that an outsider can enter this Gallic  paradise.  By marrying into it!  Two of the seven ladies in  question lack the quarterings of the rest.  Miss Mitchell was  only a charming American girl, and the mother of the Princesse  Radziwill was Mlle. Blanc of Monte Carlo.  However, as in most  religions there are ceremonies that purify, so in this case  the sacrament of marriage is supposed to have reconstructed  these wives and made them genealogically whole.</p>
<p>There is something incongruous to most people in the idea of a  young girl hardly out of the schoolroom bearing a ponderous  title.  The pomp and circumstance that surround historic names  connect them (through our reading) with stately matrons  playing the &quot;heavy female&quot; roles in life&#x27;s drama, much as Lady  Macbeth&#x27;s name evokes the idea of a raw-boned mother-in-law  sort of person, the reverse of attractive, and quite the last  woman in the world to egg her husband on to a crime - unless  it were wife murder!</p>
<p>Names like de Chevreuse, or de la Rochefoucauld, seem  appropriate only to the warlike amazons of the Fronde, or  corpulent kill-joys in powder and court trains of the Mme.  Etiquette school; it comes as a shock, on being presented to a  group of girlish figures in the latest cut of golfing skirts,  who are chattering odds on the Grand Prix in faultless  English, to realize that these light-hearted GAMINES are the  present owners of sonorous titles.  One shudders to think what  would have been the effect on poor Marie Antoinette&#x27;s priggish  mentor could she have foreseen her granddaughter, clad in  knickerbockers, running a petroleum tricycle in the streets of  Paris, or pedalling &quot;tandem&quot; across country behind some young  cavalry officer of her connection.</p>
<p>Let no simple-minded American imagine, however, that these up- to-date women are waiting to welcome him and his family to  their intimacy.  The world outside of France does not exist  for a properly brought up French aristocrat.  Few have  travelled; from their point of view, any man with money, born  outside of France, is a &quot;Rasta,&quot; unless he come with  diplomatic rank, in which case his position at home is  carefully ferreted out before he is entertained.  Wealthy  foreigners may live for years in Paris, without meeting a  single member of this coterie, who will, however, join any new  club that promises to be amusing; but as soon as the &quot;Rastas&quot;  get a footing, &quot;the seven&quot; and their following withdraw.   Puteaux had its day, then the &quot;Polo Club&quot; in the Bois became  their rendezvous.  But as every wealthy American and &quot;smart&quot;  Englishwoman passing the spring in Paris rushed for that too  open circle, like tacks toward a magnet, it was finally cut by  the &quot;Duchesses,&quot; who, together with such attractive aides-de- camp as the Princesse de Poix, Mmes. de Murat, de Morny, and  de Broglie, inaugurated last spring &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Club of the  Acacias,&quot; on a tiny island belonging to the &quot;Tir aux Pigeons,&quot;  which, for the moment, is the fad of its founders.</p>
<p>It must be a surprise to those who do not know French family  pride to learn that exclusive as these women are there are  cliques in France today whose members consider the ladies we  have been speaking of as lacking in reserve.  Men like Guy de  Durfort, Duc de Lorges, or the Duc de Massa, and their  womenkind, hold themselves aloof on an infinitely higher  plane, associating with very few and scorning the vulgar herd  of &quot;smart&quot; people!</p>
<p>It would seem as if such a vigorous weeding out of the  unworthy would result in a rather restricted comradeship.  Who  the &quot;elect&quot; are must become each year more difficult to  discern.</p>
<p>Their point of view in this case cannot differ materially from  that of the old Methodist lady, who, while she was quite sure  no one outside of her own sect could possibly be saved, had  grave fears concerning the future of most of the congregation.   She felt hopeful only of the clergyman and herself, adding:  &quot;There are days when I have me doubts about the minister!&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 22 - Growing Old Ungracefully</p>
<p>THERE comes, we are told, a crucial moment, &quot;a tide&quot; in all  lives, that taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.  An  assertion, by the bye, which is open to doubt.  What does come  to every one is an hour fraught with warning, which, if  unheeded, leads on to folly.  This fateful date coincides for  most of us with the discovery that we are turning gray, or  that the &quot;crow&#x27;s feet&quot; or our temples are becoming visible  realities.  The unpleasant question then presents itself: Are  we to slip meekly into middle age, or are arms be taken up  against our insidious enemy, and the rest of life become a  losing battle, fought inch by inch?</p>
<p>In other days it was the men who struggled the hardest against  their fate.  Up to this century, the male had always been the  ornamental member of a family.  Caesar, we read, coveted a  laurel crown principally because it would help to conceal his  baldness.  The wigs of the Grand Monarque are historical.  It  is characteristic of the time that the latter&#x27;s attempts at  rejuvenation should have been taken as a matter of course,  while a few years later poor Madame de Pompadour&#x27;s artifices  to retain her fleeting youth were laughed at and decried.</p>
<p>To-day the situation is reversed.  The battle, given up by the  men - who now accept their fate with equanimity - is being  waged by their better halves with a vigor heretofore unknown.   So general has this mania become that if asked what one  weakness was most characteristic of modern women, what  peculiarity marked them as different from their sisters in  other centuries, I should unhesitatingly answer, &quot;The desire  to look younger than their years.&quot;</p>
<p>That people should long to be handsomer or taller or better  proportioned than a cruel Providence has made them, is natural  enough; but that so much time and trouble should be spent  simply in trying to look &quot;young,&quot; does seem unreasonable,  especially when it is evident to everybody that such efforts  must, in the nature of things, be failures.  The men or women  who do not look their age are rare.  In each generation there  are exceptions, people who, from one cause or another -  generally an excellent constitution - succeed in producing the  illusion of youth for a few years after youth itself has  flown.</p>
<p>A curious fatality that has the air of a nemesis pursues those  who succeed in giving this false appearance.  When pointing  them out to strangers, their admirers (in order to make the  contrast more effective) add a decade or so to the real age.   Only last month I was sitting at dinner opposite a famous  French beauty, who at fifty succeeds in looking barely thirty.   During the meal both my neighbors directed attention to her  appearance, and in each case said: &quot;Isn&#x27;t she a wonder!  You  know she&#x27;s over sixty!&quot;  So all that poor lady gained by  looking youthful was ten years added to her age!</p>
<p>The desire to remain attractive as long as possible is not  only a reasonable but a commendable ambition.  Unfortunately  the stupid means most of our matrons adopt to accomplish this  end produce exactly the opposite result.</p>
<p>One sign of deficient taste in our day is this failure to  perceive that every age has a charm of its own which can be  enhanced by appropriate surroundings, but is lost when placed  in an incongruous setting.  It saddens a lover of the  beautiful to see matrons going so far astray in their desire  to please as to pose for young women when they no longer can  look the part.</p>
<p>Holmes, in MY MAIDEN AUNT, asks plaintively: -</p>
<p>WHY WILL SHE TRAIN THAT WINTRY CURL IN SUCH A SPRINGLIKE WAY?</p>
<p>That this folly is in the air to-day, few will dispute.  It  seems to be perpetrated unconsciously by the greater number,  with no particular object in view, simply because other people  do it.  An unanswerable argument when used by one of the fair  sex!</p>
<p>Few matrons stop to think for themselves, or they would  realize that by appearing in the same attire as their  daughters they challenge a comparison which can only be to  their disadvantage, and should be if possible avoided.  Is  there any disillusion more painful than, on approaching what  appeared from a distance to be a young girl, to find one&#x27;s  self face to face with sixty years of wrinkles?  That is a  modern version of the saying, &quot;an old head on young  shoulders,&quot; with a vengeance!  If mistaken sexagenarians could  divine the effect that tired eyes smiling from under false  hair, aged throats clasped with collars of pearls, and  rheumatic old ribs braced into a semblance of girlish grace,  produce on the men for whose benefit such adornments have been  arranged, reform would quickly follow.  There is something  absolutely uncanny in the illusion.  The more successful it  is, the more weird the effect.</p>
<p>No one wants to see Polonius in the finery of Mercutio.  What  a sense of fitness demands is, on the contrary, a &quot;make up&quot; in  keeping with the role, which does not mean that a woman is to  become a frump, but only that she is to make herself  attractive in another way.</p>
<p>During the ANCIEN REGIME in France, matters of taste were  considered all-important; an entire court would consult on the  shade of a brocade, and hail a new coiffure as an event.  The  great ladies who had left their youth behind never then  committed the blunder, so common among our middle-aged ladies,  of aping the maidens of the day.  They were far too clever for  that, and appreciated the advantages to be gained from sombre  stuffs and flattering laces.  Let those who doubt study  Nattier&#x27;s exquisite portrait of Maria Leczinska.  Nothing in  the pose or toilet suggests a desire on the painter&#x27;s part to  rejuvenate his sitter.  If anything, the queen&#x27;s age is  emphasized as something honorable.  The gray hair is simply  arranged and partly veiled with black lace, which sets off her  delicate, faded face to perfection, but without flattery or  fraud.</p>
<p>We find the same view taken of age by the masters of the  Renaissance, who appreciated its charm and loved to reproduce  its grace.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth stands out in history as a woman who struggled  ungracefully against growing old.  Her wigs and hoops and  farthingales served only to make her ridiculous, and the fact  that she wished to be painted without shadows in order to  appear &quot;young,&quot; is recorded as an aberration of a great mind.</p>
<p>Are there no painters to-day who will whisper to our wives and  mothers the secret of looking really lovely, and persuade them  to abandon their foolish efforts at rejuvenation?</p>
<p>Let us see some real old ladies once more, as they look at us  from miniature and portrait.  Few of us, I imagine, but  cherish the memory of some such being in the old home, a soft- voiced grandmother, with silvery hair brushed under a discreet  and flattering cap, with soft, dark raiment and tulle-wrapped  throat.  There are still, it is to be hoped, many such lovable  women in our land, but at times I look about me in dismay, and  wonder who is to take their places when they are gone.  Are  there to be no more &quot;old ladies&quot;?  Will the next generation  have to look back when the word &quot;grandmother&quot; is mentioned, to  a stylish vision in Parisian apparel, decollete and decked in  jewels, or arrayed in cocky little bonnets, perched on tousled  curls, knowing jackets, and golfing skirts?</p>
<p>The present horror of anything elderly comes, probably, from  the fact that the preceding generation went to the other  extreme, young women retiring at forty into becapped old age.   Knowing how easily our excitable race runs to exaggeration,  one trembles to think what surprises the future may hold, or  what will be the next decree of Dame Fashion.  Having  eliminated the &quot;old lady&quot; from off the face of the earth, how  fast shall we continue down the fatal slope toward the  ridiculous?  Shall we be compelled by a current stronger than  our wills to array ourselves each year (the bare thought makes  one shudder) in more and more youthful apparel, until  corpulent senators take to running about in &quot;sailor suits,&quot;  and octogenarian business men go &quot;down town&quot; in &quot;pinafores,&quot;  while belles of sixty or seventy summers appear in Kate  Greenaway costumes, and dine out in short-sleeved bibs, which  will allow coy glimpses of their cunning old ankles to appear  over their socks?</p>
<p>Chapter 23 - Around a Spring</p>
<p>THE greatest piece of good luck that can befall a Continental  village is the discovery, within its limits, of a spring  supplying some kind of malodorous water.  From that moment the  entire community, abandoning all other plans, give themselves  over to hatching their golden egg, experience having taught  them that no other source of prosperity can compare with a  SOURCE THERMALE.  If the water of the newfound spring, besides  having an unpleasant smell, is also hot, then Providence has  indeed blessed the township.</p>
<p>The first step is to have the fluid analyzed by a celebrity,  and its medicinal qualities duly set forth in a certificate.   The second is to get official recognition from the government  and the authorization to erect a bath house.  Once these  preliminaries accomplished, the way lies plain before the  fortunate village; every citizen, from the mayor down to the  humblest laborer, devotes himself to solving the all-important  problem how to attract strangers to the place and keep and  amuse them when they have been secured.</p>
<p>Multicolored pamphlets detailing the local attractions are  mailed to the four corners of the earth, and brilliant chromos  of the village, with groups of peasants in the foreground,  wearing picturesque costumes, are posted in every available  railway station and booking-office, regardless of the fact  that no costumes have been known in the neighborhood for half  a century, except those provided by the hotel proprietors for  their housemaids.  A national dress, however, has a fine  effect in the advertisement, and gives a local color to the  scene.  What, for instance, would Athens be without that  superb individual in national get-up whom one is sure to see  before the hotel on alighting from the omnibus?  I am  convinced that he has given as much pleasure as the Acropolis  to most travellers; the knowledge that the hotel proprietors  share the expenses of his keep and toilet cannot dispel the  charm of those scarlet embroideries and glittering arms.</p>
<p>After preparing their trap, the wily inhabitants of a new  watering-place have only to sit down and await events.  The  first people to appear on the scene are, naturally, the  English, some hidden natural law compelling that race to  wander forever in inexpensive by-ways and serve as pioneers  for other nations.  No matter how new or inaccessible the  spring, you are sure to find a small colony of Britons  installed in the half-finished hotels, reading week-old  editions of the TIMES, and grumbling over the increase in  prices since the year before.</p>
<p>As soon as the first stray Britons have developed into an  &quot;English colony,&quot; the municipality consider themselves  authorized to construct a casino and open avenues, which are  soon bordered by young trees and younger villas.  In the wake  of the English come invalids of other nationalities.  If a  wandering &quot;crowned head&quot; can be secured for a season, a great  step is gained, as that will attract the real paying public  and the Americans, who as a general thing are the last to  appear on the scene.</p>
<p>At this stage of its evolution, the &quot;city fathers&quot; build a  theatre in connection with their casino, and (persuading the  government to wink at their evasion of the gambling laws) add  games of chance to the other temptations of the place.</p>
<p>There is no better example of the way a spring can be  developed by clever handling, and satisfactory results  obtained from advertising and judicious expenditure, than Aix- les-Bains, which twenty years ago was but a tiny mountain  village, and to-day ranks among the wealthiest and most  brilliant EAUX in Europe.  In this case, it is true, they had  tradition to fall back on, for Aquae Gratinae was already a  favorite watering-place in the year 30 B.C., when Caesar took  the cure.</p>
<p>There is little doubt in my mind that when the Roman Emperor  first arrived he found a colony of spinsters and retired army  officers (from recently conquered Britain) living around this  spring in POPINAE (which are supposed to have corresponded to  our modern boarding-house), wearing waterproof togas and  common-sense cothurni, with double cork soles.</p>
<p>The wife of another Caesar fled hither in 1814.  The little  inn where she passed a summer in the company of her one-eyed  lover - while the fate of her husband and son was being  decided at Vienna and Waterloo - is still standing, and serves  as the annex of a vast new hotel.</p>
<p>The way in which a watering-place is &quot;run&quot; abroad, where  tourists are regarded as godsends, to be cherished, spoiled,  and despoiled, is amusingly different from the manner of our  village populations when summer visitors (whom they look upon  as natural enemies) appear on the scene.  Abroad the entire  town, together with the surrounding villages, hamlets, and  farmhouses, rack their brains and devote their time to  inventing new amusements for the visitor, and original ways of  enticing the gold from his pocket - for, mind you, on both  continents the object is the same.  In Europe the rural  Machiavellis have had time to learn that smiling faces and  picturesque surroundings are half the battle.</p>
<p>Another point which is perfectly understood abroad is that a  cure must be largely mental; that in consequence boredom  retards recovery.  So during every hour of the day and evening  a different amusement is provided for those who feel inclined  to be amused.  At Aix, for instance, Colonne&#x27;s orchestra plays  under the trees at the Villa des Fleurs while you are sipping  your after-luncheon coffee.  At three o&#x27;clock &quot;Guignol&quot;  performs for the youngsters.  At five o&#x27;clock there is another  concert in the Casino.  At eight o&#x27;clock an operetta is given  at the villa, and a comedy in the Casino, both ending  discreetly at eleven o&#x27;clock.  Once a week, as a variety, the  park is illuminated and fireworks help to pass the evening.</p>
<p>If neither music nor Guignol tempts you, every form of trap  from a four-horse break to a donkey-chair (the latter much in  fashion since the English queen&#x27;s visit) is standing ready in  the little square.  On the neighboring lake you have but to  choose between a dozen kinds of boats.  The hire of all these  modes of conveyance being fixed by the municipality, and  plainly printed in boat or carriage, extortions or discussions  are impossible.  If you prefer a ramble among the hills, the  wily native is lying in wait for you there also.  When you  arrive breathless at your journey&#x27;s end, a shady arbor offers  shelter where you may cool off and enjoy the view.  It is not  by accident that a dish of freshly gathered strawberries and a  bowl of milk happen to be standing near by.</p>
<p>When bicycling around the lake you begin to feel how nice a  half hour&#x27;s rest would be.  Presto! a terrace overhanging the  water appears, and a farmer&#x27;s wife who proposes brewing you a  cup of tea, supplementing it with butter and bread of her own  making.  Weak human nature cannot withstand such  blandishments.  You find yourself becoming fond of the people  and their smiling ways, returning again and again to shores  where you are made so welcome.  The fact that &quot;business&quot; is at  the bottom of all this in no way interferes with one&#x27;s  enjoyment.  On the contrary, to a practical mind it is  refreshing to see how much can be made of a little, and what a  fund of profit and pleasure can be extracted from small  things, if one goes to work in the right way.</p>
<p>The trick can doubtless be overdone: at moments one feels the  little game is worked a bit too openly.  The other evening,  for instance, when we entered the dining-room of our hotel and  found it decorated with flags and flowers, because, forsooth,  it was the birthday of &quot;Victoria R. and I.,&quot; when champagne  was offered at dessert and the band played &quot;God Save the  Queen,&quot; while the English solemnly stood up in their places,  it did seem as if the proprietor was poking fun at his guests  in a sly way.</p>
<p>I was apparently the only person, however, who felt this.  The  English were much flattered by the attention, so I snubbed  myself with the reflection that if the date had been July 4, I  doubtless should have considered the flags and music most A  PROPOS.</p>
<p>There are also moments when the vivid picturesqueness of this  place comes near to palling on one.  Its beauty is so  suspiciously like a set scene that it gives the impression of  having been arranged by some clever decorator with an eye to  effect only.</p>
<p>One is continually reminded of that inimitable chapter in  Daudet&#x27;s TARTARIN SUR LES ALPES, when the hero discovers that  all Switzerland is one enormous humbug, run to attract  tourists; that the cataracts are &quot;faked,&quot; and avalanches  arranged beforehand to enliven a dull season.  Can anything be  more delicious than the disillusion of Tartarin and his  friends, just back from a perilous chamois hunt, on  discovering that the animal they had exhausted themselves in  following all day across the mountains, was being refreshed  with hot wine in the kitchen of the hotel by its peasant  owner?</p>
<p>When one visits the theatrical abbey across the lake and  inspects the too picturesque tombs of Savoy&#x27;s sovereigns, or  walks in the wonderful old garden, with its intermittent  spring, the suspicion occurs, in spite of one&#x27;s self, that the  whole scene will be folded up at sunset and the bare-footed  &quot;brother&quot; who is showing us around with so much unction will,  after our departure, hurry into another costume, and appear  later as one of the happy peasants who are singing and  drinking in front of that absurdly operatic little inn you  pass on the drive home.</p>
<p>There is a certain pink cottage, with a thatched roof and  overhanging vines, about which I have serious doubts, and  fully expect some day to see Columbine appear on that  pistache-green balcony (where the magpie is hanging in a  wicker cage), and, taking Arlequin&#x27;s hand, disappear into the  water-butt while Clown does a header over the half-door, and  the cottage itself turns into a gilded coach, with Columbine  kissing her hand from the window.</p>
<p>A problem which our intelligent people have not yet set  themselves to solve, is being worked out abroad.  The little  cities of Europe have discovered that prosperity comes with  the tourist, that with increased facilities of communication  the township which expends the most in money and brains in  attracting rich travellers to its gates is the place that will  grow and prosper.  It is a simple lesson, and one that I would  gladly see our American watering-places learn and apply.</p>
<p>Chapter 24 - The Better Part</p>
<p>AS I watch, year after year, the flowers of our aristocratic  hothouses blooming behind the glass partitions of their  conservatories, tended always by the same gardeners, admired  by the same amateurs, and then, for the most part, withering  unplucked on their virgin stems, I wonder if the wild flowers  appreciate the good luck that allows them to taste the storm  and the sunshine untrammelled and disperse perfume according  to their own sweet will.</p>
<p>To drop a cumbersome metaphor, there is not the shadow of a  doubt that the tamest and most monotonous lives in this  country are those led by the women in our &quot;exclusive&quot; sets,  for the good reason that they are surrounded by all the  trammels of European society without enjoying any of its  benefits, and live in an atmosphere that takes the taste out  of existence too soon.</p>
<p>Girls abroad are kept away from the &quot;world&quot; because their  social life only commences after marriage.  In America, on the  contrary, a woman is laid more or less on the shelf the day  she becomes a wife, so that if she has not made hay while her  maiden sunshine lasted, the chances are she will have but  meagrely furnished lofts; and how, I ask, is a girl to harvest  always in the same field?</p>
<p>When in this country, a properly brought up young aristocrat  is presented by her mamma to an admiring circle of friends,  she is quite a BLASEE person.  The dancing classes she has  attended for a couple of years before her debut (that she  might know the right set of youths and maidens) have taken the  bloom off her entrance into the world.  She and her friends  have already talked over the &quot;men&quot; of their circle, and  decided, with a sigh, that there were matches going about.  A  juvenile Newporter was recently overheard deploring (to a  friend of fifteen summers), &quot;By the time we come out there  will only be two matches in the market,&quot; meaning, of course,  millionnaires who could provide their brides with country and  city homes, yachts, and the other appurtenances of a brilliant  position.  Now, the unfortunate part of the affair is, that  such a worldly-minded maiden will in good time be obliged to  make her debut, dine, and dance through a dozen seasons  without making a new acquaintance.  Her migrations from town  to seashore, or from one country house to another, will be but  changes of scene: the actors will remain always the same.   When she dines out, she can, if she cares to take the trouble,  make a fair guess as to who the guests will be before she  starts, for each entertainment is but a new shuffle of the too  well-known pack.  She is morally certain of being taken in to  dinner by one of fifty men whom she has known since her  childhood, and has met on an average twice a week since she  was eighteen.</p>
<p>Of foreigners such a girl sees little beyond a stray  diplomatist or two, in search of a fortune, and her glimpses  of Paris society are obtained from the windows of a hotel on  the Place Vendome.  In London or Rome she may be presented in  a few international salons, but as she finds it difficult to  make her new acquaintances understand what an exalted position  she occupies at home, the chances are that pique at seeing  some Daisy Miller attract all the attention will drive my lady  back to the city where she is known and appreciated, nothing  being more difficult for an American &quot;swell&quot; than explaining  to the uninitiated in what way her position differs from that  of the rest of her compatriots.</p>
<p>When I see the bevies of highly educated and attractive girls  who make their bows each season, I ask myself in wonder, &quot;Who,  in the name of goodness, are they to marry?&quot;</p>
<p>In the very circle where so much stress is laid on a girl&#x27;s  establishing herself brilliantly, the fewest possible husbands  are to be found.  Yet, limited as such a girl&#x27;s choice is, she  will sooner remain single than accept a husband out of her  set.  She has a perfectly distinct idea of what she wants, and  has lived so long in the atmosphere of wealth that existence  without footmen and male cooks, horses and French clothes,  appears to her impossible.  Such large proportions do these  details assume in her mind that each year the husband himself  becomes of less importance, and what he can provide the  essential point.</p>
<p>If an outsider is sufficiently rich, my lady may consent to  unite her destinies to his, hoping to get him absorbed into  her own world.</p>
<p>It is pathetic, considering the restricted number of eligible  men going about, to see the trouble and expense that parents  take to keep their daughters EN EVIDENCE.  When one reflects  on the number of people who are disturbed when such a girl  dines out, the horses and men and women who are kept up to  convey her home, the time it has taken her to dress, the cost  of the toilet itself, and then see the man to whom she will be  consigned for the evening, - some bored man about town who has  probably taken her mother in to dinner twenty years before,  and will not trouble himself to talk with his neighbor, or a  schoolboy, breaking in his first dress suit, - when one  realizes that for many maidens this goes on night after night  and season after season, it seems incredible that they should  have the courage, or think it worth their while to keep up the  game.</p>
<p>The logical result of turning eternally in the same circle is  that nine times out of ten the men who marry choose girls out  of their own set, some pretty stranger who has burst on their  jaded vision with all the charm of the unknown.  A  conventional society maiden who has not been fortunate enough  to meet and marry a man she loves, or whose fortune tempts  her, during the first season or two that she is &quot;out,&quot; will in  all probability go on revolving in an ever-narrowing circle  until she becomes stationary in its centre.</p>
<p>In comparison with such an existence the life of the average  &quot;summer girl&quot; is one long frolic, as varied as that of her  aristocratic sister is monotonous.  Each spring she has the  excitement of selecting a new battle-ground for her  manoeuvres, for in the circle in which she moves, parents  leave such details to their children.  Once installed in the  hotel of her choice, mademoiselle proceeds to make the  acquaintance of an entirely new set of friends, delightful  youths just arrived, and bent on making the most of their  brief holidays, with whom her code of etiquette allows her to  sail all day, and pass uncounted evening hours in remote  corners of piazza or beach.</p>
<p>As the words &quot;position&quot; and &quot;set&quot; have no meaning to her young  ears, and no one has ever preached to her the importance of  improving her social standing, the acquaintances that chance  throws in her path are accepted without question if they  happen to be good-looking and amusing.  She has no prejudice  as to standing, and if her supply of partners runs short, she  will dance and flirt with the clerk from the desk in perfect  good humor - in fact, she stands rather in awe of that  functionary, and admires the &quot;English&quot; cut of his clothes and  his Eastern swagger.  A large hotel is her dream of luxury,  and a couple of simultaneous flirtations her ideal of bliss.   No long evenings of cruel boredom, in order to be seen at  smart houses, will cloud the maiden&#x27;s career, no agonized  anticipation of retiring partnerless from cotillion or supper  will disturb her pleasure.</p>
<p>In the city she hails from, everybody she knows lives in about  the same style.  Some are said to be wealthier than others,  but nothing in their way of life betrays the fact; the art of  knowing how to enjoy wealth being but little understood  outside of our one or two great cities.  She has that tranquil  sense of being the social equal of the people she meets, the  absence of which makes the snob&#x27;s life a burden.</p>
<p>During her summers away from home our &quot;young friend&quot; will meet  other girls of her age, and form friendships that result in  mutual visiting during the ensuing winter, when she will  continue to add more new names to the long list of her  admirers, until one fine morning she writes home to her  delighted parents that she has found the right man at last,  and engaged herself to him.</p>
<p>Never having penetrated to those sacred centres where birth  and wealth are considered all-important, and ignoring the  supreme importance of living in one set, the plan of life that  such a woman lays out for herself is exceedingly simple.  She  will coquette and dance and dream her pleasant dream until  Prince Charming, who is to awaken her to a new life, comes and  kisses away the dew of girlhood and leads his bride out into  the work-a-day world.  The simple surroundings and ambitions  of her youth will make it easy for this wife to follow the man  of her choice, if necessary, to the remote village where he is  directing a factory or to the mining camp where the  foundations of a fortune lie.  Life is full of delicious  possibilities for her.  Men who are forced to make their way  in youth often turn out to be those who make &quot;history&quot; later,  and a bride who has not become prematurely BLASEE to all the  luxuries or pleasures of existence will know the greatest  happiness that can come into a woman&#x27;s life, that of rising at  her husband&#x27;s side, step by step, enjoying his triumphs as she  shared his poverty.</p>
<p>Chapter 25 - La Comedie Francaise a Orange</p>
<p>IDLING up through the south of France, in company with a  passionate lover of that fair land, we learned on arriving at  Lyons, that the actors of the Comedie Francaise were to pass  through there the next day, EN ROUTE for Orange, where a  series of fetes had been arranged by &quot;Les Felibres.&quot;  This  society, composed of the writers and poets of Provence, have  the preservation of the Roman theatre at Orange (perhaps the  most perfect specimen of classical theatrical architecture in  existence) profoundly at heart, their hope being to restore  some of its pristine beauty to the ruin, and give from time to  time performances of the Greek masterpieces on its disused  stage.</p>
<p>The money obtained by these representations will be spent in  the restoration of the theatre, and it is expected in time to  make Orange the centre of classic drama, as Beyreuth is that  of Wagnerian music.</p>
<p>At Lyons, the CORTEGE was to leave the Paris train and take  boats down the Rhone, to their destination.  Their programme  was so tempting that the offer of places in one of the craft  was enough to lure us away from our prearranged route.</p>
<p>By eight o&#x27;clock the following morning, we were on foot, as  was apparently the entire city.  A cannon fired from Fort  Lamothe gave the signal of our start.  The river, covered with  a thousand gayly decorated craft, glinted and glittered in the  morning light.  It world be difficult to forget that scene, -  the banks of the Rhone were lined with the rural population,  who had come miles in every direction to acclaim the passage  of their poets.</p>
<p>Everywhere along our route the houses were gayly decorated and  arches of flowers had been erected.  We float past Vienne, a  city once governed by Pontius Pilate, and Tournon, with its  feudal chateau, blue in the distance, then Saint Peray, on a  verdant vine-clad slope.  As we pass under the bridge at  Montelimar, an avalanche of flowers descends on us from above.</p>
<p>The rapid current of the river soon brings our flotilla  opposite Vivier, whose Gothic cathedral bathes its feet in the  Rhone.  Saint Esprit and its antique bridge appear next on the  horizon.  Tradition asserts that the Holy Spirit, disguised as  a stone mason, directed its construction; there were thirteen  workmen each day, but at sunset, when the men gathered to be  paid, but twelve could be counted.</p>
<p>Here the mayor and the municipal council were to have received  us and delivered an address, but were not on hand.  We could  see the tardy CORTEGE hastening towards the bridge as we shot  away down stream.</p>
<p>On nearing Orange, the banks and quays of the river are alive  with people.  The high road, parallel with the stream, is  alive with a many-colored throng.  On all sides one hears the  language of Mistral, and recognizes the music of Mireille sung  by these pilgrims to an artistic Mecca, where a miracle is to  be performed - and classic art called forth from its winding- sheet.</p>
<p>The population of a whole region is astir under the ardent  Provencal sun, to witness a resurrection of the Drama in the  historic valley of the Rhone, through whose channel the  civilization and art and culture of the old world floated up  into Europe to the ceaseless cry of the CIGALES.</p>
<p>Chateaurenard! our water journey is ended.  Through the leafy  avenues that lead to Orange, we see the arch of Marius and the  gigantic proscenium of the theatre, rising above the roofs of</p>
<p>the little city.</p>
<p>So few of our compatriots linger in the south of France after  the spring has set in, or wander in the by-ways of that  inexhaustible country, that a word about the representations  at Orange may be of interest, and perchance create a desire to  see the masterpieces of classic drama (the common inheritance  of all civilized races) revived with us, and our stage put to  its legitimate use, cultivating and elevating the taste of the  people.</p>
<p>One would so gladly see a little of the money that is  generously given for music used to revive in America a love  for the classic drama.</p>
<p>We are certainly not inferior to our neighbors in culture or  appreciation, and yet such a performance as I witnessed at  Orange (laying aside the enchantment lent by the surroundings)  would not be possible here.  Why?  But to return to my  narrative.</p>
<p>The sun is setting as we toil, ticket in hand, up the Roman  stairway to the upper rows of seats; far below the local  GENDARMERIE who mostly understand their orders backwards are  struggling with the throng, whose entrance they are apparently  obstructing by every means in their power.  Once seated, and  having a wait of an hour before us, we amused ourselves  watching the crowd filling in every corner of the vast  building, like a rising tide of multi-colored water.</p>
<p>We had purposely chosen places on the highest and most remote  benches, to test the vaunted acoustic qualities of the  auditorium, and to obtain a view of the half-circle of  humanity, the gigantic wall back of the stage, and the  surrounding country.</p>
<p>As day softened into twilight, and twilight deepened into a  luminous Southern night; the effect was incomparable.  The  belfries and roofs of mediaeval Orange rose in the clear air,  overtopping the half ruined theatre in many places.  The arch  of Marius gleamed white against the surrounding hills,  themselves violet and purple in the sunset, their shadow  broken here and there by the outline of a crumbling chateau or  the lights of a village.</p>
<p>Behind us the sentries paced along the wall, wrapped in their  dark cloaks; and over all the scene, one snowtopped peak rose  white on the horizon, like some classic virgin assisting at an  Olympian solemnity.</p>
<p>On the stage, partly cleared of the debris of fifteen hundred  years, trees had been left where they had grown, among fallen  columns, fragments of capital and statue; near the front a  superb rose-laurel recalled the Attic shores.  To the right,  wild grasses and herbs alternated with thick shrubbery, among  which Orestes hid later, during the lamentations of his  sister.  To the left a gigantic fig-tree, growing again the  dark wall, threw its branches far out over the stage.</p>
<p>It was from behind its foliage that &quot;Gaul,&quot; &quot;Provence,&quot; and  &quot;France,&quot; personated by three actresses of the &quot;Francais,&quot;  advanced to salute Apollo, seated on his rustic throne, in the  prologue which began the performance.</p>
<p>Since midday the weather had been threatening.  At seven  o&#x27;clock there was almost a shower - a moment of terrible  anxiety.  What a misfortune if it should rain, just as the  actors were to appear, here, where it had not rained for  nearly four months!  My right-hand neighbor, a citizen of  Beaucaire, assures me, &quot;It will be nothing, only a strong  `mistral&#x27; for to-morrow.&quot;  An electrician is putting the  finishing touches to his arrangements.  He tries vainly to  concentrate some light on the box where the committee is to  sit, which is screened by a bit of crumbling wall, but finally  gives it up.</p>
<p>Suddenly the bugles sound; the orchestra rings out the  Marseillaise; it is eight o&#x27;clock.  The sky is wild and  threatening.  An unseen hand strikes the three traditional  blows.  The Faun Lybrian slips down from a branch of a great  elm, and throws himself on the steps that later are to  represent the entrance to the palace of Agamemnon, and  commences the prologue (an invocation to Apollo), in the midst  of such confusion that we hear hardly a word.  Little by  little, however, the crowd quiets down, and I catch Louis  Gallet&#x27;s fine lines, marvellously phrased by Mesdames Bartet,  Dudlay, Moreno, and the handsome Fenoux as Apollo.</p>
<p>The real interest of the public is only aroused, however, when  THE ERYNNIES begins.  This powerful adaptation from the  tragedy of AEschylus is THE CHEF D&#x27;OEUVRE of Leconte de Lisle.   The silence is now complete.  One feels in the air that the  moment so long and so anxiously awaited has come, that a great  event is about to take place.  Every eye is fixed on the  stage, waiting to see what will appear from behind the dark  arches of the proscenium.  A faint, plaintive strain of music  floats out on the silence.  Demons crawl among the leafy  shadows.  Not a light is visible, yet the centre of the stage  is in strong relief, shading off into a thousand fantastic  shadows.  The audience sits in complete darkness.  Then we see  the people of Argos, winding toward us from among the trees,  lamenting, as they have done each day for ten years, the long  absence of their sons and their king.  The old men no longer  dare to consult the oracles, fearing to learn that all is  lost.  The beauty of this lament roused the first murmur of  applause, each word, each syllable, chiming out across that  vast semicircle with a clearness and an effect impossible to  describe.</p>
<p>Now it is the sentinel, who from his watch-tower has caught  the first glimpse of the returning army.  We hear him dashing  like a torrent down the turret stair; at the doorway, his  garments blown by the wind, his body bending forward in a  splendid pose of joy and exultation, he announces in a voice  of thunder the arrival of the king.</p>
<p>So completely are the twenty thousand spectators under the  spell of the drama that at this news one can feel a thrill  pass over the throng, whom the splendid verses hold  palpitating under their charm, awaiting only the end of the  tirade to break into applause.</p>
<p>From that moment the performance is one long triumph.   Clytemnestra (Madame Lerou) comes with her suite to receive  the king (Mounet-Sully), the conqueror!  I never realized  before all the perfection that training can give the speaking  voice.  Each syllable seemed to ring out with a bell-like  clearness.  As she gradually rose in the last act to the scene  with Orestes, I understood the use of the great wall behind  the actors.  It increased the power of the voices and lent  them a sonority difficult to believe.  The effect was  overwhelming when, unable to escape death, Clytemnestra cries  out her horrible imprecations.</p>
<p>Mounet-Sully surpassed himself.  Paul Mounet gave us the  complete illusion of a monster thirsting for blood, even his  mother&#x27;s!  When striking her as she struck his father, he  answers her despairing query, &quot;Thou wouldst not slay thy  mother?&quot;  &quot;Woman, thou hast ceased to be a mother!&quot;  Dudlay  (as Cassandra) reaches a splendid climax when she prophesies  the misfortune hanging over her family, which she is powerless  to avert.</p>
<p>It is impossible in feeble prose to give any idea of the  impression those lines produce in the stupendous theatre,  packed to its utmost limits - the wild night, with a storm in  the air, a stage which seems like a clearing in some forest  inhabited by Titans, the terrible tragedy of AEschylus  following the graceful fete of Apollo.</p>
<p>After the unavoidable confusion at the beginning, the vast  audience listen in profound silence to an expression of pure  art.  They are no longer actors we hear, but demi-gods.  With  voices of the storm, possessed by some divine afflatus,  thundering out verses of fire - carried out of themselves in a  whirlwind of passion, like antique prophets and Sibyls  foretelling the misfortunes of the world!</p>
<p>That night will remain immutably fixed in my memory, if I live  to be as old as the theatre itself.  We were so moved, my  companion and I, and had seen the crowd so moved, that fearing  to efface the impression if we returned the second night to  see ANTIGONE, we came quietly away, pondering over it all, and  realizing once again that a thing of beauty is a source of  eternal delight.</p>
<p>Chapter 26 - Pre-palatial Newport</p>
<p>THE historic Ocean House of Newport is a ruin.  Flames have  laid low the unsightly structure that was at one time the  best-known hotel in America.  Its fifty-odd years of  existence, as well as its day, are over.  Having served a  purpose, it has departed, together with the generation and  habits of life that produced it, into the limbo where old  houses, old customs, and superannuated ideas survive, - the  memory of the few who like to recall other days and wander  from time to time in a reconstructed past.</p>
<p>There was a certain appropriateness in the manner of its  taking off.  The proud old structure had doubtless heard  projects of rebuilding discussed by its owners (who for some  years had been threatening to tear it down); wounded doubtless  by unflattering truths, the hotel decided that if its days  were numbered, an exit worthy of a leading role was at least  possible.  &quot;Pull me down, indeed!  That is all very well for  ordinary hostleries, but from an establishment of my  pretensions, that has received the aristocracy of the country,  and countless foreign swells, something more is expected!&quot;</p>
<p>So it turned the matter over and debated within its shaky old  brain (Mrs.  Skewton fashion) what would be the most becoming  and effective way of retiring from the social whirl.  Balls  have been overdone; people are no longer tempted by  receptions; a banquet was out of the question.  Suddenly the  wily building hit on an idea.  &quot;I&#x27;ll give them a FEU  D&#x27;ARTIFICE.  There hasn&#x27;t been a first-class fire here since I  burned myself down fifty-three years ago!  That kind of  entertainment hasn&#x27;t been run into the ground like everything  else in these degenerate days!  I&#x27;ll do it in the best and  most complete way, and give Newport something to talk about,  whenever my name shall be mentioned in the future!&quot;</p>
<p>Daudet, in his L&#x27;IMMORTEL, shows us how some people are born  lucky.  His &quot;Loisel of the Institute,&quot; although an  insignificant and commonplace man, succeeded all through life  in keeping himself before the public, and getting talked about  as a celebrity.  He even arranged (to the disgust and envy of  his rivals) to die during a week when no event of importance  was occupying public attention.  In consequence, reporters,  being short of &quot;copy,&quot; owing to a dearth of murders and &quot;first  nights,&quot; seized on this demise and made his funeral an event.</p>
<p>The truth is, the Ocean House had lived so long in an  atmosphere of ostentatious worldliness that, like many  residents of the summer city, it had come to take itself and  its &quot;position&quot; seriously, and imagine that the eyes of the  country were fixed upon and expected something of it.</p>
<p>The air of Newport has always proved fatal to big hotels.  One  after another they have appeared and failed, the Ocean House  alone dragging out a forlorn existence.  As the flames worked  their will and the careless crowd enjoyed the spectacle, one  could not help feeling a vague regret for the old place, more  for what it represented than for any intrinsic value of its  own.  Without greatly stretching a point it might be taken to  represent a social condition, a phase, as it were, in our  development.  In a certain obscure way, it was an epoch- marking structure.  Its building closed the era of primitive  Newport, its decline corresponded with the end of the pre- palatial period - an era extending from 1845 to 1885.</p>
<p>During forty years Newport had a unique existence, unknown to  the rest of America, and destined to have a lasting influence  on her ways, an existence now as completely forgotten as the  earlier boarding-house MATINEE DANSANTE time. *  The sixties,  seventies, and eighties in Newport were pleasant years that  many of us regret in spite of modern progress.  Simple,  inexpensive days, when people dined at three (looking on the  newly introduced six o&#x27;clock dinners as an English innovation  and modern &quot;frill&quot;), and &quot;high-teaed&quot; together dyspeptically  off &quot;sally lunns&quot; and &quot;preserves,&quot; washed down by coffee and  chocolate, which it was the toilsome duty of a hostess to  dispense from a silver-laden tray; days when &quot;rockaways&quot; drawn  by lean, long-tailed horses and driven by mustached darkies  were, if not the rule, far from being an exception.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Newport of the Past,&quot; WORLDLY WAYS AND BY-WAYS.</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Dutch treat&quot; picnics, another archaic amusement, flourished  then, directed by a famous organizer at his farm, each guest  being told what share of the eatables it was his duty to  provide, an edict from which there was no appeal.</p>
<p>Sport was little known then, young men passing their  afternoons tooling solemnly up and down Bellevue Avenue in  top-hats and black frock-coats under the burning August sun.</p>
<p>This was the epoch when the Town and Country Club was young  and full of vigor.  We met at each other&#x27;s houses or at  historic sites to hear papers read on serious subjects.  One  particular afternoon is vivid in my memory.  We had all driven  out to a point on the shore beyond the Third Beach, where the  Norsemen were supposed to have landed during their apocryphal  visit to this continent.  It had been a hot drive, but when we  stopped, a keen wind was blowing in from the sea.  During a  pause in the prolix address that followed, a coachman&#x27;s voice  was heard to mutter, &quot;If he jaws much longer all the horses  will be foundered,&quot; which brought the learned address to an  ignominious and hasty termination.</p>
<p>Newport during the pre-palatial era affected culture, and a  whiff of Boston pervaded the air, much of which was tiresome,  yet with an under-current of charm and refinement.  Those who  had the privilege of knowing Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, will  remember the pleasant &quot;teas&quot; and sparkling conversation she  offered her guests in the unpretending cottage where the  beauty of the daughter was as brilliant as the mother&#x27;s wit.</p>
<p>Two estates on Bellevue Avenue are now without the hostesses  who, in those days, showed the world what great ladies America  could produce.  It was the foreign-born husband of one of  these women who gave Newport its first lessons in luxurious  living.  Until then Americans had travelled abroad and seen  elaborately served meals and properly appointed stables  without the ambition of copying such things at home.  Colonial  and revolutionary state had died out, and modern extravagance  had not yet appeared.  In the interregnum much was neglected  that might have added to the convenience and grace of life.</p>
<p>In France, under Louis Philippe, and in England, during  Victoria&#x27;s youth, taste reached an ebb tide; in neither of  those countries, however, did the general standard fall so low  as here.  It was owing to the SAVOIR FAIRE of one man that  Newporters and New York first saw at home what they had  admired abroad, - liveried servants in sufficient numbers,  dinners served A LA RUSSE, and breeched and booted grooms on  English-built traps, innovations quickly followed by his  neighbors, for the most marked characteristic of the American  is his ability to &quot;catch on.&quot;</p>
<p>When, during the war of the secession, our Naval Academy was  removed from Annapolis and installed in the empty Atlantic  House (corner of Bellevue Avenue and Pelham Street), hotel  life had already begun to decline; but the Ocean House, which  was considered a vast enterprise at that time, inherited from  the older hotels the custom of giving Saturday evening &quot;hops,&quot;  the cottagers arriving at these informal entertainments toward  nine o&#x27;clock and promenading up and down the corridors or  dancing in the parlor, to the admiration of a public collected  to enjoy the spectacle.  At eleven the doors of the dining- room opened, and a line of well-drilled darkies passed ices  and lemonade.  By half-past eleven (the hour at which we now  arrive at a dance) every one was at home and abed.</p>
<p>One remembers with a shudder the military manoeuvres that  attended hotel meals in those days, the marching and  countermarching, your dinner cooling while the head waiter  reviewed his men.  That idiotic custom has been abandoned,  like many better and worse.  Next to the American ability to  catch on comes the facility with which he can drop a fad.</p>
<p>In this peculiarity the history of Newport has been an epitome  of the country, every form of amusement being in turn taken  up, run into the ground, and then abandoned.  At one time it  was the fashion to drive to Fort Adams of an afternoon and  circle round and round the little green to the sounds of a  military band; then, for no visible reason, people took to  driving on the Third Beach, an inaccessible and lonely point  which for two or three summers was considered the only correct  promenade.</p>
<p>I blush to recall it, but at that time most of the turnouts  were hired hacks.  Next, Graves Point, on the Ocean Drive,  became the popular meeting-place.  Then society took to  attending polo of an afternoon, a sport just introduced from  India.  This era corresponded with the opening of the Casino  (the old reading-room dating from 1854).  For several years  every one crowded during hot August mornings onto the airless  lawns and piazzas of the new establishment.  It seems on  looking back as if we must have been more fond of seeing each  other in those days than we are now.  To ride up and down a  beach and bow filled our souls with joy, and the &quot;cake walk&quot;  was an essential part of every ball, the guests parading in  pairs round and round the room between the dances instead of  sitting quietly &quot;out.&quot;  The opening promenade at the New York  Charity Ball is a survival of this inane custom.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the Ocean House &quot;hops&quot; marked the last  stage in hotel life.  Since then better-class watering places  all over the country have slowly but surely followed Newport&#x27;s  lead.  The closed caravansaries of Bar Harbor and elsewhere  bear silent testimony to the fact that refined Americans are  at last awakening to the charms of home life during their  holidays, and are discarding, as fast as finances will permit,  the pernicious herding system.  In consequence the hotel has  ceased to be, what it undoubtedly was twenty years ago, the  focus of our summer life.</p>
<p>Only a few charred rafters remain of the Ocean House.  A few  talkative old duffers like myself alone survive the day it  represents.  Changing social conditions have gradually placed  both on the retired list.  A new and palatial Newport has  replaced the simpler city.  Let us not waste too much time  regretting the past, or be too sure that it was better than  the present.  It is quite possible, if the old times we are  writing so fondly about should return, we might discover that  the same thing was true of them as a ragged urchin asserted  the other afternoon of the burning building:</p>
<p>&quot;Say, Tom, did ye know there was the biggest room in the world  in that hotel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No; what room?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Room for improvement, ya!&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 27 - SARDOU at Marly-le-Roy</p>
<p>NEAR the centre of that verdant triangle formed by Saint  Cloud, Versailles, and Saint Germain lies the village of  Marly-le-Roy, high up on a slope above the lazy Seine - an  entrancing corner of the earth, much affected formerly by  French crowned heads, and by the &quot;Sun King&quot; in particular, who  in his old age grew tired of Versailles and built here one of  his many villas (the rival in its day of the Trianons), and  proceeded to amuse himself therein with the same solemnity  which had already made vice at Versailles more boresome than  virtue elsewhere.</p>
<p>Two centuries and four revolutions have swept away all trace  of this kingly caprice and the art treasures it contained.   Alone, the marble horses of Coustou, transported later to the  Champs Elysees, remain to attest the splendor of the past.</p>
<p>The quaint village of Marly, clustered around its church,  stands, however - with the faculty that insignificant things  have of remaining unchanged - as it did when the most polished  court of Europe rode through it to and from the hunt.  On the  outskirts of this village are now two forged and gilded  gateways through which the passer-by can catch a glimpse of  trim avenues, fountains, and well-kept lawns.</p>
<p>There seems a certain poetical justice in the fact that  Alexandre Dumas FILS and Victorien Sardou, the two giants of  modern drama, should have divided between them the inheritance  of Louis XIV., its greatest patron.  One of the gates is  closed and moss-grown.  Its owner lies in Pere-la-Chaise.  At  the other I ring, and am soon walking up the famous avenue  bordered by colossal sphinxes presented to Sardou by the late  Khedive.  The big stone brutes, connected in one&#x27;s mind with  heat and sandy wastes, look oddly out of place here in this  green wilderness - a bite, as it were, out of the forest  which, under different names, lies like a mantle over the  country-side.</p>
<p>Five minutes later I am being shown through a suite of antique  salons, in the last of which sits the great playwright.  How  striking the likeness is to Voltaire, - the same delicate  face, lit by a half cordial, half mocking smile; the same  fragile body and indomitable spirit.  The illusion is enhanced  by our surroundings, for the mellow splendor of the room where  we stand might have served as a background for the Sage of  Ferney.</p>
<p>Wherever one looks, works of eighteenth-century art meet the  eye.  The walls are hung with Gobelin tapestries that fairly  take one&#x27;s breath away, so exquisite is their design and their  preservation.  They represent a marble colonnade, each column  of which is wreathed with flowers and connected to its  neighbor with garlands.</p>
<p>Between them are bits of delicate landscape, with here and  there a group of figures dancing or picnicking in the shadow  of tall trees or under fantastical porticos.  The furniture of  the room is no less marvellous than its hangings.  One turns  from a harpsichord of vernis-martin to the clock, a relic from  Louis XIV.&#x27;s bedroom in Versailles; on to the bric-a-brac of  old Saxe or Sevres in admiring wonder.  My host drifts into  his showman manner, irresistibly comic in this writer.</p>
<p>The pleasures of the collector are apparently divided into  three phases, without counting the rapture of the hunt.   First, the delight a true amateur takes in living among rare  and beautiful things.  Second, the satisfaction of showing  one&#x27;s treasures to less fortunate mortals, and last, but  perhaps keenest of all, the pride which comes from the fact  that one has been clever enough to acquire objects which other  people want, at prices below their market value.  Sardou  evidently enjoys these three sensations vividly.  That he  lives with and loves his possessions is evident, and the smile  with which he calls your attention to one piece after another,  and mentions what they cost him, attests that the two other  joys are not unknown to him.  He is old enough to remember the  golden age when really good things were to be picked up for  modest sums, before every parvenu considered it necessary to  turn his house into a museum, and factories existed for the  production of &quot;antiques&quot; to be sold to innocent amateurs.</p>
<p>In calling attention to a set of carved and gilded furniture,  covered in Beauvais tapestry, such as sold recently in Paris  at the Valencay sale - Talleyrand collection - for sixty  thousand dollars, Sardou mentions with a laugh that he got his  fifteen pieces for fifteen hundred dollars, the year after the  war, from an old chateau back of Cannes!  One unique piece of  tapestry had cost him less than one-tenth of that sum.  He  discovered it in a peasant&#x27;s stable under a two-foot layer of  straw and earth, where it had probably been hidden a hundred  years before by its owner, and then all record of it lost by  his descendants.</p>
<p>The mention of Cannes sets Sardou off on another train of  thought.  His family for three generations have lived there.   Before that they were Sardinian fishermen.  His great- grandfather, he imagines, was driven by some tempest to the  shore near Cannes and settled where he found himself.  Hence  the name!  For in the patois of Provencal France an inhabitant  of Sardinia is still called UN SARDOU.</p>
<p>The sun is off the front of the house by this time, so we  migrate to a shady corner of the lawn for our APERITIF, the  inevitable vermouth or &quot;bitters&quot; which Frenchmen take at five  o&#x27;clock.  Here another surprise awaits the visitor, who has  not realized, perhaps, to what high ground the crawling local  train has brought him.  At our feet, far below the lawn and  shade trees that encircle the chateau, lies the Seine,  twisting away toward Saint Germain, whose terrace and  dismantled palace stand outlined against the sky.  To our  right is the plain of Saint Denis, the cathedral in its midst  looking like an opera-glass on a green table.  Further still  to the right, as one turns the corner of the terrace, lies  Paris, a white line on the horizon, broken by the mass of the  Arc de Triomphe, the roof of the Opera, and the Eiffel Tower,  resplendent in a fresh coat of yellow lacquer!</p>
<p>The ground where we stand was occupied by the feudal castle of  Les Sires de Marly; although all traces of that stronghold  disappeared centuries ago, the present owner of the land  points out with pride that the extraordinary beauty of the  trees around his house is owing to the fact that their roots  reach deep down to the rich loam collected during centuries in  the castle&#x27;s moat.</p>
<p>The little chateau itself, built during the reign of Louis  XIV. for the GRAND-VENEUR of the forest of Marly, is intensely  French in type, - a long, low building on a stone terrace,  with no trace of ornament about its white facade or on its  slanting roof.  Inside, all the rooms are &quot;front,&quot;  communicating with each other EN SUITE, and open into a  corridor running the length of the building at the back,  which, in turn, opens on a stone court.  Two lateral wings at  right angles to the main building form the sides of this  courtyard, and contain LES COMMUNS, the kitchen, laundry,  servants&#x27; rooms, and the other annexes of a large  establishment.  This arrangement for a summer house is for  some reason neglected by our American architects.  I can  recall only one home in America built on this plan.  It is  Giraud Foster&#x27;s beautiful villa at Lenox.  You may visit five  hundred French chateaux and not find one that differs  materially from this plan.  The American idea seems on the  contrary to be a square house with a room in each corner, and  all the servants&#x27; quarters stowed away in a basement.  Cottage  and palace go on reproducing that foolish and inconvenient  arrangement indefinitely.</p>
<p>After an hour&#x27;s chat over our drinks, during host has rippled  on from one subject to another with the lightness of touch of  a born talker, we get on to the subject of the grounds, and  his plans for their improvement.</p>
<p>Good luck has placed in Sardou&#x27;s hands an old map of the  gardens as they existed in the time of Louis XV., and several  prints of the chateau dating from about the same epoch have  found their way into his portfolios.  The grounds are, under  his care, slowly resuming the appearance of former days.  Old  avenues reopen, statues reappear on the disused pedestals,  fountains play again, and clipped hedges once more line out</p>
<p>the terraced walks.</p>
<p>In order to explain how complete this work will be in time,  Sardou hurries me off to inspect another part of his  collection.  Down past the stables, in an unused corner of the  grounds, long sheds have been erected, under which is stored  the debris of a dozen palaces, an assortment of eighteenth- century art that could not be duplicated even in France.</p>
<p>One shed shelters an entire semicircle of TREILLAGE, pure  Louis XV., an exquisite example of a lost art.  Columns,  domes, panels, are packed away in straw awaiting resurrection  in some corner hereafter to be chosen.  A dozen seats in rose- colored marble from Fontainebleau are huddled together near by  in company with a row of gigantic marble masques brought  originally from Italy to decorate Fouquet&#x27;s fountains at his  chateau of Vaux in the short day of its glory.  Just how this  latter find is to be utilized their owner has not yet decided.   The problem, however, to judge from his manner, is as  important to the great playwright as the plot of his next  drama.</p>
<p>That the blood of an antiquarian runs in Sardou&#x27;s veins is  evident in the subdued excitement with which he shows you his  possessions - statues from Versailles, forged gates and  balconies from Saint Cloud, the carved and gilded wood-work  for a dozen rooms culled from the four corners of France.   Like the true dramatist, he has, however, kept his finest  effect for the last.  In the centre of a circular rose garden  near by stands, alone in its beauty, a column from the facade  of the Tuileries, as perfect from base to flower-crowned  capital as when Philibert Delorme&#x27;s workmen laid down their  tools.</p>
<p>Years ago Sardou befriended a young stone mason, who through  this timely aid prospered, and, becoming later a rich builder,  received in 1882 from the city of Paris the contract to tear  down the burned ruins of the Tuileries.  While inspecting the  palace before beginning the work of demolition, he discovered  one column that had by a curious chance escaped both the  flames of the Commune and the patriotic ardor of 1793, which  effaced all royal emblems from church and palace alike.   Remembering his benefactor&#x27;s love for antiquities with  historical associations, the grateful contractor appeared one  day at Marly with this column on a dray, and insisted on  erecting it where it now stands, pointing out to Sardou with  pride the crowned &quot;H,&quot; of Henri Quatre, and the entwined &quot;M.  M.&quot; of Marie de Medicis, topped by the Florentine lily in the  flutings of the shaft and on the capital.</p>
<p>A question of mine on Sardou&#x27;s manner of working led to our  abandoning the gardens and mounting to the top floor of the  chateau, where his enormous library and collection of prints  are stored in a series of little rooms or alcoves, lighted  from the top and opening on a corridor which runs the length  of the building.  In each room stands a writing-table and a  chair; around the walls from floor to ceiling and in huge  portfolios are arranged his books and engravings according to  their subject.  The Empire alcove, for instance, contains  nothing but publications and pictures relating to that epoch.   Roman and Greek history have their alcoves, as have mediaeval  history and the reigns of the different Louis.  Nothing could  well be conceived more conducive to study than this  arrangement, and it makes one realize how honest was the  master&#x27;s reply when asked what was his favorite amusement.   &quot;Work!&quot; answered the author.</p>
<p>Our conversation, as was fated, soon turned to the enormous  success of ROBESPIERRE in London - a triumph that even  Sardou&#x27;s many brilliant victories had not yet equalled.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the French disposition that neither  the author nor any member of his family could summon courage  to undertake the prodigious journey from Paris to London in  order to see the first performance.  Even Sardou&#x27;s business  agent, M. Roget, did not get further than Calais, where his  courage gave out.  &quot;The sea was so terrible!&quot;  Both those  gentlemen, however, took it quite as a matter of course that  Sardou&#x27;s American agent should make a three-thousand-mile  journey to be present at the first night.</p>
<p>The fact that the French author resisted Sir Henry Irving&#x27;s  pressing invitations to visit him in no way indicates a lack  of interest in the success of the play.  I had just arrived  from London, and so had to go into every detail of the  performance, a rather delicate task, as I had been discouraged  with the acting of both Miss Terry and Irving, who have  neither of them the age, voice, nor temperament to represent  either the revolutionary tyrant or the woman he betrayed.  As  the staging had been excellent, I enlarged on that side of the  subject, but when pressed into a corner by the author, had to  acknowledge that in the scene where Robespierre, alone at  midnight in the Conciergerie, sees the phantoms of his victims  advance from the surrounding shadows and form a menacing  circle around him, Irving had used his poor voice with so  little skill that there was little left for the splendid  climax, when, in trying to escape from his ghastly visitors,  Robespierre finds himself face to face with Marie Antoinette,  and with a wild cry, half of horror, half of remorse, falls  back insensible.</p>
<p>In spite of previous good resolutions, I must have given the  author the impression that Sir Henry spoke too loud at the  beginning of this scene and was in consequence inadequate at  the end.</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; cried Sardou.  &quot;He raised his voice in that act!  Why,  it&#x27;s a scene to be played with the soft pedal down!  This is  the way it should be done!&quot;  Dropping into a chair in the  middle of the room my host began miming the gestures and  expression of Robespierre as the phantoms (which, after all,  are but the figments of an over-wrought brain) gather around  him.  Gradually he slipped to the floor, hiding his face with  his upraised elbow, whispering and sobbing, but never raising  his voice until, staggering toward the portal to escape, he  meets the Queen face to face.  Then the whole force of his  voice came out in one awful cry that fairly froze the blood in  my veins!</p>
<p>&quot;What a teacher you would make!&quot; instinctively rose to my lips  as he ended.</p>
<p>With a careless laugh, Sardou resumed his shabby velvet cap,  which had fallen to the floor, and answered: &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s  nothing!  I only wanted to prove to you that the scene was not  a fatiguing one for the voice if played properly.  I&#x27;m no  actor and could not teach, but any one ought to know enough  not to shout in that scene!&quot;</p>
<p>This with some bitterness, as news had arrived that Irving&#x27;s  voice had given out the night before, and he had been replaced  by his half-baked son in the title role, a change hardly  calculated to increase either the box-office receipts or the  success of the new drama.</p>
<p>Certain ominous shadows which, like Robespierre&#x27;s visions, had  been for some time gathering in the corners of the room warned  me that the hour had come for my trip back to Paris.   Declining reluctantly an invitation to take potluck with my  host, I was soon in the Avenue of the Sphinx again.  As we  strolled along, talking of the past and its charm, a couple of  men passed us, carrying a piece of furniture rolled in  burlaps.</p>
<p>&quot;Another acquisition?&quot; I asked.  &quot;What epoch has tempted you  this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m sorry you won&#x27;t stop and inspect it,&quot; answered Sardou  with a twinkle in his eye.  &quot;It&#x27;s something I bought yesterday  for my bedroom.  An armchair!  Pure Loubet!&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 28 - Inconsistencies</p>
<p>THE dinner had been unusually long and the summer evening  warm.  During the wait before the dancing began I must have  dropped asleep in the dark corner of the piazza where I had  installed myself, to smoke my cigar, away from the other men  and their tiresome chatter of golf and racing.  Through the  open window groups of women could be seen in the ball-room,  and the murmur of their conversation floated out, mingling  with the laughter of the men.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in that casual way peculiar to dreams, I found  myself conversing with a solemn young Turk, standing in all  the splendor of fez and stambouline beside my chair.</p>
<p>&quot;Pardon, Effendi,&quot; he was murmuring.  &quot;Is this an American  ball?  I was asked at nine o&#x27;clock; it is now past eleven.  Is  there not some mistake?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;None,&quot; I answered.  &quot;When a hostess puts nine o&#x27;clock on her  card of invitation she expects her guests at eleven or half- past, and would be much embarrassed to be taken literally.&quot;</p>
<p>As we were speaking, our host rose.  The men, reluctantly  throwing away their cigars, began to enter the ball-room  through the open windows.  On their approach the groups of  women broke up, the men joining the girls where they sat, or  inviting them out to the lantern-lit piazza, where the couples  retired to dim, palm-embowered corners.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you sure I have not made a mistake?&quot; asked my  interlocutor, with a faint quiver of the eyelids.  &quot;It is my  intention, while travelling, to remain faithful to my harem.&quot;</p>
<p>I hastened to reassure him and explain that he was in an  exclusive and reserved society.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; he murmured incredulously.  &quot;When I was passing  through New York last winter a lady was pointed out to me as  the owner of marvellous jewels and vast wealth, but with  absolutely no social position.  My informant added that no  well-born woman would receive her or her husband.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s foolish, of course, but the handsome woman with the  crown on sitting in the centre of that circle, looks very like  the woman I mean.  Am I right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s the same lady,&quot; I answered, wearily.  &quot;You are speaking  of last year.  No one could be induced to call on the couple  then.  Now we all go to their house, and entertain them in  return.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They have doubtless done some noble action, or the reports  about the husband have been proved false?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of the kind has taken place.  She&#x27;s a success, and no  one asks any questions!  In spite of that, you are in a  society where the standard of conduct is held higher than in  any country of Europe, by a race of women more virtuous, in  all probability, than has yet been seen.  There is not a man  present,&quot; I added, &quot;who would presume to take, or a woman who  would permit, a liberty so slight even as the resting of a  youth&#x27;s arm across the back of her chair.&quot;</p>
<p>While I was speaking, an invisible orchestra began to sigh out  the first passionate bars of a waltz.  A dozen couples rose,  the men clasping in their arms the slender matrons, whose  smiling faces sank to their partners&#x27; shoulders.  A blond  mustache brushed the forehead of a girl as she swept by us to  the rhythm of the music, and other cheeks seemed about to  touch as couples glided on in unison.</p>
<p>The sleepy Oriental eyes of my new acquaintance opened wide  with astonishment.</p>
<p>&quot;This, you must understand,&quot; I continued, hastily, &quot;is quite  another matter.  Those people are waltzing.  It is considered  perfectly proper, when the musicians over there play certain  measures, for men to take apparent liberties.  Our women are  infinitely self-respecting, and a man who put his arm around a  woman (in public) while a different measure was being played,  or when there was no music, would be ostracized from polite  society.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am beginning to understand,&quot; replied the Turk.  &quot;The  husbands and brothers of these women guard them very  carefully.  Those men I see out there in the dark are  doubtless with their wives and sisters, protecting them from  the advances of other men.  Am I right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you&#x27;re not right,&quot; I snapped out, beginning to lose  my temper at his obtuseness.  &quot;No husband would dream of  talking to his wife in public, or of sitting with her in a  corner.  Every one would be laughing at them.  Nor could a  sister be induced to remain away from the ball-room with her  brother.  Those girls are `sitting out&#x27; with young men they  like, indulging in a little innocent flirtation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is that?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Flirtation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An American custom rather difficult to explain.  It may,  however, be roughly defined as the art of leading a man a long  way on the road to - nowhere!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Women flirt with friends or acquaintances, never with members  of their family?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The husbands are those dejected individuals wandering  aimlessly about over there like lost souls.  They are mostly  rich men, who, having married beautiful girls for love, wear  themselves out maintaining elaborate and costly establishments  for them.  In return for his labor a husband, however, enjoys  but little of his wife&#x27;s society, for a really fashionable  woman can rarely be induced to go home until she has collapsed  with fatigue.  In consequence, she contributes little but  `nerves&#x27; and temper to the household.  Her sweetest smiles,  like her freshest toilets, are kept for the public.  The  husband is the last person considered in an American  household.  If you doubt what I say, look behind you.  There  is a newly married man speaking with his wife, and trying to  persuade her to leave before the cotillion begins.  Notice his  apologetic air!  He knows he is interrupting a tender  conversation and taking an unwarrantable liberty.  Nothing  short of extreme fatigue would drive him to such an extremity.   The poor millionnaire has hardly left his desk in Wall Street  during the week, and only arrived this evening in time to  dress for dinner.  He would give a fair slice of his income  for a night&#x27;s rest.  See!  He has failed, and is lighting  another cigar, preparing, with a sigh, for a long wait.  It  will be three before my lady is ready to leave.&quot;</p>
<p>After a silence of some minutes, during which he appeared to  be turning these remarks over in his mind, the young Oriental  resumed: &quot;The single men who absorb so much of your women&#x27;s  time and attention are doubtless the most distinguished of the  nation,  - writers, poets, and statesmen?&quot;</p>
<p>I was obliged to confess that this was not the case; that, on  the contrary, the dancing bachelors were for the most part  impecunious youths of absolutely no importance, asked by the  hostess to fill in, and so lightly considered that a woman did  not always recognize in the street her guests of the evening  before.</p>
<p>At this moment my neighbor&#x27;s expression changed from  bewilderment to admiration, as a young and very lovely matron  threw herself, panting, into a low chair at his side.  Her  decollete was so daring that the doubts of half an hour before  were evidently rising afresh in his mind.  Hastily resuming my  task of mentor, I explained that a decollete corsage was an  absolute rule for evening gatherings.  A woman who appeared in  a high bodice or with her neck veiled would be considered  lacking in politeness to her hostess as much if she wore a  bonnet.</p>
<p>&quot;With us, women go into the world to shine and charm.  It is  only natural they should use all the weapons nature has given  them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very good!&quot; exclaimed the astonished Ottoman.  &quot;But where  will all this end?  You began by allowing your women to appear  in public with their faces unveiled, then you suppressed the  fichu and the collarette, and now you rob them of half their  corsage.  Where, O Allah, will you stop?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah!&quot; I answered, laughing, &quot;the tendency of civilization is  to simplify; many things may yet disappear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand perfectly.  You have no prejudice against women  wearing in public toilets that we consider fitted only for  strict intimacy.  In that case your ladies may walk about the  streets in these costumes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not at all!&quot; I cried.  &quot;It would provoke a scandal if a woman  were to be seen during the daytime in such attire, either at  home or abroad.  The police and the law courts would  interfere.  Evening dress is intended only for reunions in  private houses, or at most, to be worn at entertainments where  the company is carefully selected and the men asked from lists  prepared by the ladies themselves.  No lady would wear a ball  costume or her jewels in a building where the general public  was admitted.  In London great ladies dine at restaurants in  full evening dress, but we Americans, like the French,  consider that vulgar.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet, last winter,&quot; he said, &quot;when passing through New York, I  went to a great theatre, where there were an orchestra and  many singing people.  Were not those respectable women I saw  in the boxes?  There were no MOUCHARABIES to screen them from  the eyes of the public.  Were all the men in that building  asked by special invitation?  That could hardly be possible,  for I paid an entrance fee at the door.  From where I sat I  could see that, as each lady entered her box, opera-glasses  were fixed on her, and her `points,&#x27; as you say, discussed by  the crowd of men in the corridors, who, apparently, belonged  to quite the middle class.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My poor, innocent Padischa, you do not understand at all.   That was the opera, which makes all the difference.  The  husbands of those women pay enormous prices, expressly that  their wives may exhibit themselves in public, decked in jewels  and suggestive toilets.  You could buy a whole harem of fair  Circassians for what one of those little square boxes costs.   A lady whose entrance caused no sensation would feel bitterly  disappointed.  As a rule, she knows little about music, and  cares still less, unless some singer is performing who is paid  a fabulous price, which gives his notes a peculiar charm.   With us most things are valued by the money they have cost.   Ladies attend the opera simply and solely to see their friends  and be admired.</p>
<p>&quot;It grieves me to see that you are forming a poor opinion of  our woman kind, for they are more charming and modest than any  foreign women.  A girl or matron who exhibits more of her  shoulders than you, with your Eastern ideas, think quite  proper, would sooner expire than show an inch above her ankle.   We have our way of being modest as well as you, and that is  one of our strongest prejudices.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now I know you are joking,&quot; he replied, with a slight show of  temper, &quot;or trying to mystify me, for only this morning I was  on the beach watching the bathing, and I saw a number of  ladies in quite short skirts - up to their knees, in fact -  with the thinnest covering on their shapely extremities.  Were  those women above suspicion?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Absolutely,&quot; I assured him, feeling inclined to tear my hair  at such stupidity.  &quot;Can&#x27;t you see the difference?  That was  in daylight.  Our customs allow a woman to show her feet, and  even a little more, in the morning.  It would be considered  the acme of indecency to let those beauties be seen at a ball.   The law allows a woman to uncover her neck and shoulders at a  ball, but she would be arrested if she appeared decollete on  the beach of a morning.&quot;</p>
<p>A long silence followed, broken only by the music and laughter  from the ball-room.  I could see my dazed Mohammedan remove  his fez and pass an agitated hand through his dark hair; then  he turned, and saluting me gravely, murmured:</p>
<p>&quot;It is very kind of you to have taken so much trouble with me.   I do not doubt that what you have said is full of the wisdom  and consistency of a new civilization, which I fail to  appreciate.&quot;  Then, with a sigh, he added: &quot;It will be better  for me to return to my own country, where there are fewer  exceptions to rules.&quot;</p>
<p>With a profound salaam the gentle youth disappeared into the  surrounding darkness, leaving me rubbing my eyes and asking  myself if, after all, the dreamland Oriental was not about  right.  Custom makes many inconsistencies appear so logical  that they no longer cause us either surprise or emotion.  But  can we explain them?</p>
<p>Chapter 29 - Modern &quot;Cadets de Gascogne&quot;</p>
<p>AFTER witnessing the performance given by the Comedie  Francaise in the antique theatre at Orange, we determined - my  companion and I - if ever another opportunity of the kind  offered, to attend, be the material difficulties what they  might.</p>
<p>The theatrical &quot;stars&quot; in their courses proved favorable to  the accomplishment of this vow.  Before the year ended it was  whispered to us that the &quot;Cadets de Gascogne&quot; were planning a  tram through the Cevennes Mountains and their native Languedoc  - a sort of lay pilgrimage to famous historic and literary  shrines, a voyage to be enlivened by much crowning of busts  and reciting of verses in the open air, and incidentally, by  the eating of Gascony dishes and the degustation of delicate  local wines; the whole to culminate with a representation in  the arena at Beziers of DEJANIRE, Louis Gallet&#x27;s and Saint- Saens&#x27;s latest work, under the personal supervision of those  two masters.</p>
<p>A tempting programme, was it not, in these days of cockney  tours and &quot;Cook&quot; couriers?  At any rate, one that we, with  plenty of time on our hands and a weakness for out-of-the-way  corners and untrodden paths, found it impossible to resist.</p>
<p>Rostand, in CYRANO DE BERGERAC, has shown us the &quot;Cadets&quot; of  Moliere&#x27;s time, a fighting, rhyming, devil-may-care band, who  wore their hearts on their sleeves and chips on their stalwart  shoulders; much such a brotherhood, in short, as we love to  imagine that Shakespeare, Kit Marlowe, Greene, and their  intimates formed when they met at the &quot;Ship&quot; to celebrate a  success or drink a health to the drama.</p>
<p>The men who compose the present society (which has now for  many years borne a name only recently made famous by M.  Rostand&#x27;s genius) come delightfully near realizing the happy  conditions of other days, and - less the fighting - form as  joyous and picturesque a company as their historic elders.   They are for the most part Southern-born youths, whose  interests and ambitions centre around the stage, devotees at  the altar of Melpomene, ardent lovers of letters and kindred  arts, and proud of the debt that literary France owes to  Gascony.</p>
<p>It is the pleasant custom of this coterie to meet on winter  evenings in unfrequented CAFES, transformed by them for the  time into clubs, where they recite new-made verses, discuss  books and plays, enunciate paradoxes that make the very  waiters shudder, and, between their &quot;bocks,&quot; plan vast  revolutions in the world of literature.</p>
<p>As the pursuit of &quot;letters&quot; is, if anything, less lucrative in  France than in other countries, the question of next day&#x27;s  dinner is also much discussed among these budding Molieres,  who are often forced to learn early in their careers, when  meals have been meagre, to satisfy themselves with rich rhymes  and drink their fill of flowing verse.</p>
<p>From time to time older and more successful members of the  corporation stray back into the circle, laying aside their  laurel crowns and Olympian pose, in the society of the new- comers to Bohemia.  These honorary members enjoy nothing more  when occasion offers than to escape from the toils of  greatness and join the &quot;Cadets&quot; in their summer journeys to  and fro in France, trips which are made to combine the  pleasures of an outing with the aims of a literary campaign.   It was an invitation to join one of these tramps that tempted  my friend and me away from Paris at the season when that city  is at its best.  Being unable, on account of other  engagements, to start with the cohort from the capital, we  made a dash for it and caught them up at Carcassonne during  the fetes that the little Languedoc city was offering to its  guests.</p>
<p>After having seen Aigues Mortes, it was difficult to believe  that any other place in Europe could suggest more vividly the</p>
<p>days of military feudalism.  St. Louis&#x27;s tiny city is,  however, surpassed by Carcassonne!</p>
<p>Thanks to twenty years of studious restoration by Viollet le  Duc, this antique jewel shines in its setting of slope and  plain as perfect to-day (seen from the distance) as when the  Crusaders started from its crenelated gates for the conquest  of the Holy Sepulchre.  The acropolis of Carcassonne is  crowned with Gothic battlements, the golden polygon of whose  walls, rising from Roman foundations and layers of ruddy  Visigoth brick to the stately marvel of its fifty towers,  forms a whole that few can view unmoved.</p>
<p>We found the Cadets lunching on the platform of the great  western keep, while a historic pageant organized in their  honor was winding through the steep mediaeval streets - a  cavalcade of archers, men at arms, and many-colored  troubadours, who, after effecting a triumphal entrance to the  town over lowered drawbridges, mounted to unfurl their banner  on our tower.  As the gaudy standard unfolded on the evening  air, Mounet-Sully&#x27;s incomparable voice breathed the very soul  of the &quot;Burgraves&quot; across the silent plain and down through  the echoing corridors below.  While we were still under the  impression of the stirring lines, he changed his key and  whispered:-</p>
<p>LE SOIR TOMBE. . . . L&#x27;HEURE DOUCE QUI S&#x27;ELOIGNE SANS SECOUSSE, POSE A PEINE SUR LA MOUSSE SES PIEDS. UN JOUR INDECIS PERSISTE, ET LE CREPUSCULE TRISTE OUVRE SES YEUX D&#x27;AMETHYSTE MOUILLES.</p>
<p>Night came on ere the singing and reciting ended, a balmy  Southern evening, lit by a thousand fires from tower and  battlement and moat, the old walls glowing red against the  violet sky.</p>
<p>Picture this scene to yourself, reader mine, and you will  understand the enthusiasm of the artists and writers in our  clan.  It needed but little imagination then to reconstruct  the past and fancy one&#x27;s self back in the days when the  &quot;Trancavel&quot; held this city against the world.</p>
<p>Sleep that night was filled with a strange phantasmagoria of  crenelated chateaux and armored knights, until the bright  Provencal sunlight and the call for a hurried departure  dispelled such illusions.  By noon we were far away from  Carcassonne, mounting the rocky slopes of the Cevennes amid a  wild and noble landscape; the towering cliffs of the  &quot;Causses,&quot; zebraed by zig-zag paths, lay below us, disclosing  glimpses of fertile valley and vine-engarlanded plain.</p>
<p>One asks one&#x27;s self in wonder why these enchanting regions are  so unknown.  EN ROUTE our companions were like children fresh  from school, taking haphazard meals at the local inns and  clambering gayly into any conveyance that came to hand.  As  our way led us through the Cevennes country, another charm  gradually stole over the senses.</p>
<p>&quot;I imagine that Citheron must look like this,&quot; murmured  Catulle Mendes, as we stood looking down from a sun-baked  eminence, &quot;with the Gulf of Corinth there where you see that  gleam of water.&quot;  As he spoke he began declaiming the passage  from Sophocles&#x27;s OEDIPUS THE KING descriptive if that classic  scene.</p>
<p>Two thousand feet below lay Ispanhac in a verdant valley, the  River Tarn gleaming amid the cultivated fields like a cimeter  thrown on a Turkish carpet.  Our descent was an avalanche of  laughing, singing &quot;Cadets,&quot; who rolled in the fresh-cut grass  and chased each other through the ripening vineyards, shouting  lines from tragedies to groups of open-mouthed farm-hands, and  invading the tiny inns on the road with song and tumult.  As  we neared our goal its entire population, headed by the cure,  came out to meet us and offer the hospitality of the town.</p>
<p>In the market-place, one of our number, inspired by the  antique solemnity of the surroundings, burst into the noble  lines of Hugo&#x27;s DEVANT DIEU, before which the awestruck  population uncovered and crossed themselves, imagining,  doubtless, that it was a religious ceremony.</p>
<p>Another scene recurs vividly to my memory.  We were at St.  Enimie.  I had opened my window to breathe the night air after  the heat and dust of the day and watch the moonlight on the  quaint bridge at my feet.  Suddenly from out the shadows there  rose (like sounds in a dream) the exquisite tone of Sylvain&#x27;s  voice, alternating with the baritone of d&#x27;Esparbes.  They were  seated at the water&#x27;s edge, intoxicated by the beauty of the  scene and apparently oblivious of all else.</p>
<p>The next day was passed on the Tarn, our ten little boats  following each other single file on the narrow river, winding  around the feet of mighty cliffs, or wandering out into sunny  pasture lands where solitary peasants, interrupted in their  labors, listened in astonishment to the chorus thundered from  the passing boats, and waved us a welcome as we moved by.</p>
<p>Space is lacking to give more than a suggestion of those days,  passed in every known conveyance from the antique diligence to  the hissing trolley, in company with men who seemed to have  left their cares and their years behind them in Paris.</p>
<p>Our last stop before arriving at Beziers was at La Case, where  luncheon was served in the great hall of the chateau.  Armand  Sylvestre presided at the repast; his verses alternated with  the singings of Emma Calve, who had come from her neighboring  chateau to greet her old friends and compatriots, the  &quot;Cadets.&quot;</p>
<p>As the meal terminated, more than one among the guests, I  imagine, felt his heart heavy with the idea that to-morrow  would end this pleasant ramble and send him back to the  realities of life and the drudgery of daily bread-winning.</p>
<p>The morning of the great day dawned cloudless and cool.  A  laughing, many-colored throng early invaded the arena, the  women&#x27;s gay toilets lending it some resemblance to a parterre  of fantastic flowers.  Before the bell sounded its three  strokes that announced the representation, over ten thousand  spectators had taken their places and were studying the  gigantic stage and its four thousand yards of painted canvas.   In the foreground a cluster of Greek palaces and temples  surround a market-place; higher up and further back the city  walls, manned by costumed sentinels, rise against mountains so  happily painted that their outlines blend with nature&#x27;s own  handiwork in the distance, - a worthy setting for a stately  drama and the valiant company of actors who have travelled  from the capital for this solemnity.</p>
<p>Three hundred hidden musicians, divided into wind and chord  orchestras, accompany a chorus of two hundred executants, and  furnish the music for a ballet of seventy dancers.</p>
<p>As the third stroke dies away, the Muse, Mademoiselle  Rabuteau, enters and declaims the salutation addressed by  Louis Gallet to the City of Beziers.  At its conclusion the  tragedy begins.</p>
<p>This is not the place to describe or criticise at length so  new an attempt at classic restoration.  The author follows the  admirable fable of antiquity with a directness and simplicity  worthy of his Greek model.  The story of Dejanira and Hercules  is too familiar to be repeated here.  The hero&#x27;s infidelity  and the passion of a neglected woman are related through five  acts logically and forcibly, with the noble music of Saint- Saens as a background.</p>
<p>We watch the growing affection of the demi-god for the gentle  Iole.  We sympathize with jealous, desperate Dejanira when in  a last attempt to gain back the love of Hercules she persuades  the unsuspecting Iole to offer him a tunic steeped in Nessus&#x27;s  blood, which Dejanira has been told by Centaur will when  warmed in the sun restore the wearer to her arms.</p>
<p>At the opening of the fifth act we witness the nuptial fetes.   Religious dances and processions circle around the pyre laid  for a marriage sacrifice.  Dejanira, hidden in the throng,  watches in an agony of hope for the miracle to be worked.</p>
<p>Hercules accepts the fatal garment from the hands of his bride  and calls upon the sun-god to ignite the altars.  The pyre  flames, the heat warms the clinging tunic, which wraps  Hercules in its folds of torture.  Writhing in agony, he  flings himself upon the burning pyramid, followed by Dejanira,  who, in despair, sees too late that she has been but a tool in  the hands of Nessus.</p>
<p>No feeble prose, no characters of black or white, can do  justice to the closing scenes of this performance.  The roar  of the chorus, the thunder of the actors&#x27; voices, the  impression of reality left on the breathless spectators by the  open-air reality of the scene, the ardent sun, the rustling  wind, the play of light and shade across the stage, the  invocation of Hercules addressed to the real heavens, not to a  painted firmament, combined an effect that few among that vast  concourse will forget.</p>
<p>At the farewell banquet in the arena after the performance,  Georges Leygues, the captain of the Cadets, in answer to a  speech from the Prefect, replied: &quot;You ask about our aims and  purposes and speak in admiration of the enthusiasm aroused by  the passage of our band!</p>
<p>&quot;Our aims are to vivify the traditions and language of our  native land, and the memory of a glorious ancestry, to foster  the love of our little province at the same time as patriotism  for the greater country.  We are striving for a  decentralization of art, for the elevation of the stage; but  above all, we preach a gospel of gayety and healthy laughter,  the science of remaining young at heart, would teach pluck and  good humor in the weary struggle of existence, characteristics  that have marked our countrymen through history!  We have  borrowed a motto from Lope de Vega (that Gascon of another  race), and inscribe `PAR LA LANGUA ET PAR L&#x27;EPEE&#x27; upon our  banner, that these purposes may be read by the world as it  runs.&quot;</p>
<p>Chapter 30 - The Dinner and the Drama</p>
<p>CLAUDE FROLLO, holding the first printed book he had seen in  one hand, and pointing with the other to the gigantic mass of  Notre Dame, dark against the sunset, prophesied &quot;CECI TUERA  CELA.&quot;  One might to-day paraphrase the sentence which Victor  Hugo put into his archdeacon&#x27;s mouth, and pointing to the  elaborately appointed dinner-tables of our generation, assert  that the Dinner was killing the Drama.</p>
<p>New York undoubtedly possesses at this moment more and better  constructed theatres, in proportion to its population, than  any other city on the globe, and, with the single exception of  Paris, more money is probably spent at the theatre by our  people than in any other metropolis.  Yet curiously enough,  each decade, each season widens the breach between our  discriminating public and the stage.  The theatre, instead of  keeping abreast with the intellectual movement of our country,  has for the last thirty years been slowly but steadily  declining, until at this moment there is hardly a company  playing in legitimate comedy, tragedy, or the classic  masterpieces of our language.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that we are a nation in full literary  production, boasting authors who rank with the greatest of  other countries, there is hardly one poet or prose-writer to- day, of recognized ability, who works for the stage, nor can  we count more than one or two high-class comedies or lyric  dramas of American origin.</p>
<p>It is not my intention here to criticise the contemporary  stage, although the condition of the drama in America is so  unique and so different from its situation in other countries  that it might well attract the attention of inquiring minds;  but rather to glance at the social causes which have produced  this curious state of affairs, and the strained relations  existing between our elite (here the word is used in its  widest and most elevated sense) and our stage.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the deterioration in the class  of plays produced at our theatres has been brought about by  changes in our social conditions.  The pernicious &quot;star&quot;  system, the difficulty of keeping stock companies together,  the rarity of histrionic ability among Americans are  explanations which have at different times been offered to  account for these phenomena.  Foremost, however, among the  causes should be placed an exceedingly simple and prosaic fact  which seems to have escaped notice.  I refer to the  displacement of the dinner hour, and the ceremony now  surrounding that meal.</p>
<p>Forty years ago dinner was still a simple affair, taken at  hours varying from three to five o&#x27;clock, and uniting few but  the members of a family, holidays and fetes being the rare  occasions when guests were asked.  There was probably not a  hotel in this country at that time where a dinner was served  later than three o&#x27;clock, and Delmonico&#x27;s, newly installed in  Mr. Moses Grinnell&#x27;s house, corner of Fourteenth Street and  Fifth Avenue, was the only establishment of its kind in  America, and the one restaurant in New York where ladies could  be taken to dine.  In those tranquil days when dinner parties  were few and dances a rarity, theatre-going was the one ripple  on the quiet stream of home life.  Wallack&#x27;s, at the corner of  Thirteenth Street and Broadway, Booth&#x27;s in Twenty-third  Street, and Fechter&#x27;s in Fourteenth Street were the homes of  good comedy and high-class tragedy.</p>
<p>Along about 1870 the more aristocratically-minded New Yorkers  took to dining at six or six-thirty o&#x27;clock; since then each  decade has seen the dinner recede further into the night,  until it is a common occurrence now to sit down to that repast  at eight or even nine o&#x27;clock.  Not only has the hour changed,  but the meal itself has undergone a radical transformation, in  keeping with the general increase of luxurious living,  becoming a serious although hurried function.  In consequence,  to go to the theatre and be present at the rising of the  curtain means, for the majority possessing sufficient means to  go often to the play and culture enough to be discriminating,  the disarrangement of the entire machinery of a household as  well as the habits of its inmates.</p>
<p>In addition to this, dozens of sumptuous establishments have  sprung up where the pleasure of eating is supplemented by  allurements to the eye and ear.  Fine orchestras play nightly,  the air is laden with the perfume of flowers, a scenic  perspective of palm garden and marble corridor flatters the  senses.  The temptation, to a man wearied by a day of business  or sport, to abandon the idea of going to a theatre, and  linger instead over his cigar amid these attractive  surroundings, is almost irresistible.</p>
<p>If, however, tempted by some success, he hurries his guests  away from their meal, they are in no condition to appreciate a  serious performance.  The pressure has been too high all day  for the overworked man and his ENERVEE wife to desire any but  the lightest tomfoolery in an entertainment.  People engaged  in the lethargic process of digestion are not good critics of  either elevated poetry or delicate interpretation, and in  consequence crave amusement rather than a mental stimulant.</p>
<p>Managers were quick to perceive that their productions were no  longer taken seriously, and that it was a waste of time and  money to offer high-class entertainments to audiences whom any  nonsense would attract.  When a play like THE SWELL MISS  FITZWELL will pack a New York house for months, and then float  a company on the high tide of success across the continent, it  would be folly to produce anything better.  New York  influences the taste of the country; it is in New York really  that the standard has been lowered.</p>
<p>In answer to these remarks, the question will doubtless be  raised, &quot;Are not the influences which it is asserted are  killing the drama in America at work in England or on the  Continent, where people also dine late and well?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, and no!  People abroad dine as well, undoubtedly; as  elaborately?  Certainly not!  With the exception of the  English (and even among them dinner-giving has never become so  universal as with us), no other people entertain for the  pleasure of hospitality.  On the Continent, a dinner-party is  always an &quot;axe-grinding&quot; function.  A family who asked people  to dine without having a distinct end in view for such an  outlay would be looked upon by their friends and relatives as  little short of lunatics.  Diplomatists are allowed certain  sums by their governments for entertaining, and are formally  dined in return by their guests.  A great French lady who is  asked to dine out twice a week considers herself fortunate; a  New York woman of equal position hardly dines at home from  December 1 to April 15, unless she is receiving friends at her  own table.</p>
<p>Parisian ladies rarely go to restaurants.  In London there are  not more than three or four places where ladies can be taken  to dine, while in this city there are hundreds; our people  have caught the habit of dining away from home, a custom  singularly in keeping with the American temperament; for,  although it costs more, it is less trouble!</p>
<p>The reason why foreigners do not entertain at dinner is  because they have found other and more satisfactory ways of  spending their money.  This leaves people abroad with a number  of evenings on their hands, unoccupied hours that are  generally passed at the theatre.  Only the other day a  diplomatist said to me, &quot;I am surprised to see how small a  place the theatre occupies in your thoughts and conversation.   With us it is the pivot around which life revolves.&quot;</p>
<p>From one cause or another, not only the wealthy, but the  thoughtful and cultivated among us, go less each year to the  theatre.  The abstinence of this class is the most  significant, for well-read, refined, fastidious citizens are  the pride of a community, and their influence for good is far- reaching.  Of this elite New York has more than its share, but  you will not meet them at the play, unless Duse or Jefferson,  Bernhardt or Coquelin is performing.  The best only tempts  such minds.  It was by the encouragement of this class that  Booth was enabled to give HAMLET one hundred consecutive  evenings, and Fechter was induced to linger here and build a  theatre.</p>
<p>In comparison with the verdicts of such people, the opinions  of fashionable sets are of little importance.  The latter long  ago gave up going to the play in New York, except during two  short seasons, one in the autumn, &quot;before things get going,&quot;  and again in the spring, after the season is over, before they  flit abroad or to the country.  During these periods &quot;smart&quot;  people generally attend in bands called &quot;theatre parties,&quot; an  infliction unknown outside of this country, an arrangement  above all others calculated to bring the stage into contempt,  as such parties seldom arrive before the middle of the second  act, take ten minutes to get seated, and then chat gayly among  themselves for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>The theatre, having ceased to form an integral part of our  social life, has come to be the pastime of people with nothing  better to do, - the floating population of our hotels, the  shop-girl and her young man enjoying an evening out.  The  plays produced by the gentlemen who, I am told, control the  stage in this country for the moment, are adapted to the  requirements of an audience that, having no particular  standard from which to judge the literary merits of a play,  the training, accent, or talent of the actors, are perfectly  contented so long as they are amused.  To get a laugh, at any  price, has become the ambition of most actors and the dream of  managers.</p>
<p>A young actress in a company that played an American  translation of MME.  SANS GENE all over this continent asked  me recently what I thought of their performance.  I said I  thought it &quot;a burlesque of the original!&quot;  &quot;If you thought it  a burlesque here in town,&quot; she answered, &quot;it&#x27;s well you didn&#x27;t  see us on the road.  There was no monkey trick we would not  play to raise a laugh.&quot;</p>
<p>If one of my readers doubts the assertion that the better  classes have ceased to attend our theatres, except on rare  occasions, let him inquire about, among the men and women  whose opinions he values and respects, how many of last  winter&#x27;s plays they considered intellectual treats, or what  piece tempted them to leave their cosy dinner-tables a second  time.  It is surprising to find the number who will answer in  reply to a question about the merits of a play EN VOGUE, &quot;I  have not seen it.  In fact I rarely go to a theatre unless I  am in London or on the Continent!&quot;</p>
<p>Little by little we have taken to turning in a vicious and  ever-narrowing circle.  The poorer the plays, the less clever  people will make the effort necessary to see them, and the  less such elite attend, the poorer the plays will become.</p>
<p>That this state of affairs is going to last, however, I do not  believe.  The darkest hour is ever the last before the dawn.   As it would he difficult for the performances in most of our  theatres to fall any lower in the scale of frivolity or  inanity, we may hope for a reaction that will be deep and far- reaching.  At present we are like people dying of starvation  because they do not know how to combine the flour and water  and yeast before them into wholesome bread.  The materials for  a brilliant and distinctly national stage undoubtedly exist in  this country.  We have men and women who would soon develop  into great actors if they received any encouragement to devote  themselves to a higher class of work, and certainly our great  city does not possess fewer appreciative people than it did  twenty years ago.</p>
<p>The great dinner-giving mania will eat itself out; and  managers, feeling once more that they can count on  discriminating audiences, will no longer dare to give garbled  versions of French farces or feeble dramas as compiled from  English novels, but, turning to our own poets and writers,  will ask them to contribute towards the formation of an  American stage literature.</p>
<p>When, finally, one of our poets gives us a lyric drama like  CYRANO DE BERGERAC, the attractions of the dinner-table will  no longer be strong enough to keep clever people away from the  theatre, and the following conversation, which sums up the  present situation, will become impossible.</p>
<p>BANKER (to Crushed Tragedian). - No, I haven&#x27;t seen you act.   I have not been inside a theatre for two years!</p>
<p>C.T. - It&#x27;s five years since I&#x27;ve been inside a bank!</p>
<p>Chapter 31 - The Modern ASPASIA</p>
<p>MOST of the historic cities of Europe have a distinct local  color, a temperament, if one may be allowed the expression, of  their own.  The austere calm of Bruges or Ghent, the sensuous  beauty of Naples, attract different natures.  Florence has  passionate devotees, who are insensible to the artistic grace  of Venice or the stately quiet of Versailles.  In Cairo one  experiences an exquisite BIEN ETRE, a mindless, ambitionless  contentment which, without being languor, soothes the nerves  and tempts to indolent lotus-eating.  Like a great hive, Rome  depends on the memories that circle around her, storing, like  bees, the centuries with their honey.  Each of these cities  must therefore leave many people unmoved, who after a passing  visit, wander away, wondering at the enthusiasm of the  worshippers.</p>
<p>Paris alone seems to possess the charm that bewitches all  conditions, all ages, all degrees.  To hold the frivolous- minded she paints her face and dances, leading them a round of  folly, exhaustive alike to health and purse.  For the student  she assumes another mien, smiling encouragement, and urging  him upward towards the highest standards, while posing as his  model.  She takes the dreaming lover of the past gently by the  hand, and leading him into quiet streets and squares where she  has stored away a wealth of hidden treasure, enslaves him as  completely as her more sensual admirers.</p>
<p>Paris is no less adored by the vacant-minded, to whom neither  art nor pleasure nor study appeal.  Her caprices in fashion  are received by the wives and daughters of the universe as  laws, and obeyed with an unwavering faith, a mute obedience  that few religions have commanded.  Women who yawn through  Italy and the East have, when one meets them in the French  capital, the intense manner, the air of separation from things  mundane, that is observable in pilgrims approaching the shrine  of their deity.  Mohammedans at Mecca must have some such  look.  In Paris women find themselves in the presence of those  high priests whom they have long worshipped from a distance.   It is useless to mention other subjects to the devotee, for  they will not fix her attention.  Her thoughts are with her  heart, and that is far away.</p>
<p>When visiting other cities one feels that they are like honest  married women, living quiet family lives, surrounded by their  children.  The French Aspasia, on the contrary, has never been  true to any vow, but has, at the dictate of her passions,  changed from royal and imperial to republican lovers, and back  again, ruled by no laws but her caprices, and discarding each  favorite in turn with insults when she has wearied of him.   Yet sovereigns are her slaves, and leave their lands to linger  in her presence; and rich strangers from the four corners of  the earth come to throw their fortunes at her feet and bask a  moment in her smiles.</p>
<p>Like her classic prototype, Paris is also the companion of the  philosophers and leads the arts in her train.  Her palaces are  the meeting-places of the poets, the sculptors, the  dramatists, and the painters, who are never weary of  celebrating her perfections, nor of working for her adornment  and amusement.</p>
<p>Those who live in the circle of her influence are caught up in  a whirlwind of artistic production, and consume their brains  and bodies in the vain hope of pleasing their idol and  attracting her attention.  To be loved by Paris is an ordeal  that few natures can stand, for she wrings the lifeblood from  her devotees and then casts them aside into oblivion.  Paris,  said one of her greatest writers, &quot;AIME A BRISER SES IDOLES!&quot;   As Ulysses and his companions fell, in other days, a prey to  the allurements of Circe, so our powerful young nation has  fallen more than any other under the influence of the French  siren, and brings her a yearly tribute of gold which she  receives with avidity, although in her heart there is little  fondness for the giver.</p>
<p>Americans who were in Paris two years ago had an excellent  opportunity of judging the sincerity of Parisian affection,  and of sounding the depth and unselfishness of the love that  this fickle city gives us in return for our homage.  Not for  one moment did she hesitate, but threw the whole weight of her  influence and wit into the scale for Spain.  If there is not  at this moment a European alliance against America it is not  from any lack of effort on her part towards that end.</p>
<p>The stand taken by LA VILLA LUMIERE in that crisis caused many  naive Americans, who believed that their weakness for the  French capital was returned, a painful surprise.  They  imagined in the simplicity of their innocent hearts that she  loved them for themselves, and have awakened, like other rich  lovers, to the humiliating knowledge that a penniless neighbor  was receiving the caresses that Croesus paid for.  Not only  did the entire Parisian press teem at that moment with covert  insults directed towards us, but in society, at the clubs and  tables of the aristocracy, it was impossible for an American  to appear with self-respect, so persistently were our actions  and our reasons for undertaking that war misunderstood and  misrepresented.  In the conversation of the salons and in the  daily papers it was assumed that the Spanish were a race of  noble patriots, fighting in the defence of a loved and loyal  colony, while we were a horde of blatant cowards, who had long  fermented a revolution in Cuba in order to appropriate that  coveted island.</p>
<p>When the Spanish authorities allowed an American ship  (surprised in one of her ports by the declaration of war) to  depart unharmed, the fact was magnified into an act of almost  ideal generosity; on the other hand, when we decided not to  permit privateering, that announcement was received with  derisive laughter as a pretentious pose to cover hidden  interests.  There is reason to believe, however, that this  feeling in favor of Spain goes little further than the press  and the aristocratic circles so dear to the American  &quot;climber&quot;; the real heart of the French nation is as true to  us as when a century ago she spent blood and treasure in our  cause.  It is the inconstant capital alone that, false to her  role of liberator, has sided with the tyrant.</p>
<p>Yet when I wander through her shady parks or lean over her  monumental quays, drinking in the beauty of the first spring  days, intoxicated by the perfume of the flowers that the night  showers have kissed into bloom; or linger of an evening over  my coffee, with the brilliant life of the boulevards passing  like a carnival procession before my eyes; when I sit in her  theatres, enthralled by the genius of her actors and  playwrights, or stand bewildered before the ten thousand  paintings and statues of the Salon, I feel inclined, like a  betrayed lover, to pardon my faithless mistress: she is too  lovely to remain long angry with her.  You realize she is  false and will betray you again, laughing at you, insulting  your weakness; but when she smiles all faults are forgotten;  the ardor of her kisses blinds you to her inconstancy; she  pours out a draught that no other hands can brew, and clasps  you in arms so fair that life outside those fragile barriers  seems stale and unprofitable.</p>
<p>Chapter 32 - A Nation in a Hurry</p>
<p>IN early days of steam navigation on the Mississippi, the  river captains, it is said, had the playful habit, when  pressed for time or enjoying a &quot;spurt&quot; with a rival, of  running their engines with a darky seated on the safety-valve.</p>
<p>One&#x27;s first home impression after a season of lazy Continental  travelling and visiting in somnolent English country houses,  is that an emblematical Ethiopian should be quartered on our  national arms.</p>
<p>Zola tells us in NOUVELLE CAMPAGNE that his vivid impressions  are all received during the first twenty-four hours in a new  surrounding, - the mind, like a photographic film, quickly  losing its sensibility.</p>
<p>This fleeting receptiveness makes returning Americans  painfully conscious of nerves in the home atmosphere, and the  headlong pace at which our compatriots are living.</p>
<p>The habit of laying such faults to the climate is but a poor  excuse.  Our grandparents and their parents lived peaceful  lives beneath these same skies, undisturbed by the morbid  influences that are supposed to key us to such a painful  concert pitch.</p>
<p>There was an Indian summer languor in the air as we steamed up  the bay last October, that apparently invited repose; yet no  sooner had we set foot on our native dock, and taken one good  whiff of home air, than all our acquired calm disappeared.   People who ten days before would have sat (at a journey&#x27;s end)  contentedly in a waiting-room, while their luggage was being  sorted by leisurely officials, now hustle nervously about,  nagging the custom-house officers and egging on the porters,  as though the saving of the next half hour were the prime  object of existence.</p>
<p>Considering how extravagant we Americans are in other ways it  seems curious that we should be so economical of time!  It was  useless to struggle against the current, however, or to  attempt to hold one&#x27;s self back.  Before ten minutes on shore  had passed, the old, familiar, unpleasant sensation of being  in a hurry took possession of me!  It was irresistible and  all-pervading; from the movements of the crowds in the streets  to the whistle of the harbor tugs, everything breathed of  haste.  The very dogs had apparently no time to loiter, but  scurried about as though late for their engagements.</p>
<p>The transit from dock to hotel was like a visit to a new  circle in the INFERNO, where trains rumble eternally overhead,  and cable cars glide and block around a pale-faced throng of  the damned, who are forced, in expiation of their sins, to  hasten forever toward an unreachable goal.</p>
<p>A curious curse has fallen upon our people; an &quot;influence&quot; is  at work which forces us to attempt in an hour just twice as  much as can be accomplished in sixty minutes.  &quot;Do as well as  you can,&quot; whispers the &quot;influence,&quot; &quot;but do it quickly!&quot;  That  motto might be engraved upon the fronts of our homes and  business buildings.</p>
<p>It is on account of this new standard that rapidity in a  transaction on the Street is appreciated more than correctness  of detail.  A broker to-day will take more credit for having  received and executed an order for Chicago and returned an  answer within six minutes, than for any amount of careful  work.  The order may have been ill executed and the details  mixed, but there will have been celerity of execution to boast  of</p>
<p>The young man who expects to succeed in business to-day must  be a &quot;hustler,&quot; have a snap-shot style in conversation,  patronize rapid transit vehicles, understand shorthand, and  eat at &quot;breathless breakfasts.&quot;</p>
<p>Being taken recently to one of these establishments for &quot;quick  lunch,&quot; as I believe the correct phrase is, to eat buckwheat  cakes (and very good they were), I had an opportunity of  studying the ways of the modern time-saving young man.</p>
<p>It is his habit upon entering to dash for the bill-of-fare,  and give an order (if he is adroit enough to catch one of the  maids on the fly) before removing either coat or hat.  At  least fifteen seconds may be economized in this way.  Once  seated, the luncher falls to on anything at hand; bread, cold  slaw, crackers, or catsup.  When the dish ordered arrives, he  gets his fork into it as it appears over his shoulder, and has  cleaned the plate before the sauce makes its appearance, so  that is eaten by itself or with bread.</p>
<p>Cups of coffee or tea go down in two swallows.  Little piles  of cakes are cut in quarters and disappear in four mouthfuls,  much after the fashion of children down the ogre&#x27;s throat in  the mechanical toy, mastication being either a lost art or  considered a foolish waste of energy.</p>
<p>A really accomplished luncher can assimilate his last quarter  of cakes, wiggle into his coat, and pay his check at the desk  at the same moment.  The next, he is down the block in pursuit  of a receding trolley.</p>
<p>To any one fresh from the Continent, where the entire  machinery of trade comes to a stand-still from eleven to one  o&#x27;clock, that DEJEUNER may be taken in somnolent tranquillity,  the nervous tension pervading a restaurant here is prodigious,  and what is worse - catching!  During recent visits to the  business centres of our city, I find that the idea of eating  is repugnant.  It seems to be wrong to waste time on anything  so unproductive.  Last week a friend offered me a &quot;luncheon  tablet&quot; from a box on his desk.  &quot;It&#x27;s as good as a meal,&quot; he  said, &quot;and so much more expeditious!&quot;</p>
<p>The proprietor of one down-town restaurant has the stock  quotations exhibited on a black-board at the end of his room;  in this way his patrons can keep in touch with the &quot;Street&quot; as  they hurriedly stoke up.</p>
<p>A parlor car, toward a journey&#x27;s end, is another excellent  place to observe our native ways.  Coming from Washington the  other day my fellow-passengers began to show signs of  restlessness near Newark.  Books and papers were thrown aside;  a general &quot;uprising, unveiling&quot; followed, accompanied by our  objectionable custom of having our clothes brushed in each  other&#x27;s faces.  By the time Jersey City appeared on the  horizon, every man, woman, and child in that car was jammed,  baggage in hand, into the stuffy little passage which precedes  the entrance, swaying and staggering about while the train  backed and delayed.</p>
<p>The explanation of this is quite simple.  The &quot;influence&quot; was  at work, preventing those people from acting like other  civilized mortals, and remaining seated until their train had  come to a standstill.</p>
<p>Being fresh from the &quot;other side,&quot; and retaining some of my  acquired calm, I sat in my chair!  The surprise on the faces  of the other passengers warned me, however, that it would not  be safe to carry this pose too far.  The porter, puzzled by  the unaccustomed sight, touched me kindly on the shoulder, and  asked if I &quot;felt sick&quot;!  So now, to avoid all affectation of  superiority, I struggled into my great-coat, regardless of  eighty degrees temperature in the car, and meekly joined the  standing army of martyrs, to hurry, scampering with them from  the still-moving car to the boat, and on to the trolley before  the craft had been moored to its landing pier.</p>
<p>In Paris, on taking an omnibus, you are given a number and the  right to the first vacant seat.  When the places in a &quot;bus&quot;  are all occupied it receives no further occupants.  Imagine a  traction line attempting such a reform here!  There would be a  riot, and the conductors hanged to the nearest trolley-poles  in an hour!</p>
<p>To prevent a citizen from crowding into an over-full vehicle,  and stamping on its occupants in the process, would be to  infringe one of his dearest privileges, not to mention his  chance of riding free.</p>
<p>A small boy of my acquaintance tells me he rarely finds it  necessary to pay in a New York car.  The conductors are too  hurried and too preoccupied pocketing their share of the  receipts to keep count.  &quot;When he passes, I just look blank!&quot;  remarked the ingenious youth.</p>
<p>Of all the individuals, however, in the community, our idle  class suffer the most acutely from lack of time, though, like  Charles Lamb&#x27;s gentleman, they have all there is.</p>
<p>From the moment a man of leisure, or his wife, wakens in the  morning until they drop into a fitful slumber at night, their  day is an agitated chase.  No matter where or when you meet  them, they are always on the wing.</p>
<p>&quot;Am I late again?&quot; gasped a thin little woman to me the other  evening, as she hurried into the drawing-room, where she had  kept her guests and dinner waiting.  &quot;I&#x27;ve been so driven all  day, I&#x27;m a wreck!&quot;  A glance at her hatchet-faced husband  revealed the fact that he, too, was chasing after a stray  half-hour lost somewhere in his youth.  His color and most of  his hair had gone in its pursuit, while his hands had acquired  a twitch, as though urging on a tired steed.</p>
<p>Go and ask that lady for a cup of tea at twilight; ten to one  she will receive you with her hat on, explaining that she has  not had time to take it off since breakfast.  If she writes to  you, her notes are signed, &quot;In great haste,&quot; or &quot;In a tearing  hurry.&quot;  She is out of her house by half-past eight on most  mornings, yet when calling she sits on the edge of her chair,  and assures you that she has not a moment to stay, &quot;has only  run in,&quot; etc.</p>
<p>Just what drives her so hard is a mystery, for beyond a vague  charity meeting or two and some calls, she accomplishes  little.  Although wealthy and childless, with no cares and few  worries, she succumbs to nervous prostration every two or  three years, &quot;from overwork.&quot;</p>
<p>Listen to a compatriot&#x27;s account of his European trip!  He  will certainly tell you how short the ocean crossing was,  giving hours and minutes with zest, as though he had got ahead  of Father Time in a transaction.  Then follows a list of the  many countries seen during his tour.</p>
<p>I know a lady lying ill to-day because she would hurry herself  and her children, in six weeks last summer, through a  Continental tour that should have occupied three months.  She  had no particular reason for hurrying; indeed, she got ahead  of her schedule, and had to wait in Paris for the steamer; a  detail, however, that in no way diminished madame&#x27;s pleasure  in having done so much during her holiday.  This same lady  deplores lack of leisure hours, yet if she finds by her  engagement book that there is a free week ahead, she will run  to Washington or Lakewood, &quot;for a change,&quot; or organize a party  to Florida.</p>
<p>To realize how our upper ten scramble through existence, one  must also contrast their fidgety way of feeding with the  bovine calm in which a German absorbs his nourishment and the  hours Italians can pass over their meals; an American dinner  party affords us the opportunity.</p>
<p>There is an impression that the fashion for quickly served  dinners came to us from England.  If this is true (which I  doubt; it fits too nicely with our temperament to have been  imported), we owe H.R.H. a debt of gratitude, for nothing is  so tiresome as too many courses needlessly prolonged.</p>
<p>Like all converts, however, we are too zealous.  From oysters  to fruit, dinners now are a breathless steeplechase, during  which we take our viand hedges and champagne ditches at a dead  run, with conversation pushed at much the same speed.  To be  silent would be to imply that one was not having a good time,  so we rattle and gobble on toward the finger-bowl winning- post, only to find that rest is not there!</p>
<p>As the hostess pilots the ladies away to the drawing-room, she  whispers to her spouse, &quot;You won&#x27;t smoke long, will you?&quot;  So  we are mulcted in the enjoyment of even that last resource of  weary humanity, the cigar, and are hustled away from that and  our coffee, only to find that our appearance is a signal for a  general move.</p>
<p>One of the older ladies rises; the next moment the whole  circle, like a flock of frightened birds, are up and off,  crowding each other in the hallway, calling for their  carriages, and confusing the unfortunate servants, who are  trying to help them into their cloaks and overshoes.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the guests come as late as they dare,  without being absolutely uncivil, that dinners are served as  rapidly as is physically possible, and that the circle breaks  up as soon as the meal ends, one asks one&#x27;s self in wonder  why, if a dinner party is such a bore that it has to be  scrambled through, COUTE QUE COUTE, we continue to dine out?</p>
<p>It is within the bounds of possibility that people may have  reasons for hurrying through their days, and that dining out A  LA LONGUE becomes a weariness.</p>
<p>The one place, however, where you might expect to find people  reposeful and calm is at the theatre.  The labor of the day is  then over; they have assembled for an hour or two of  relaxation and amusement.  Yet it is at the play that our  restlessness is most apparent.  Watch an audience (which, be  it remarked in passing, has arrived late) during the last ten  minutes of a performance.  No sooner do they discover that the  end is drawing near than people begin to struggle into their  wraps.  By the time the players have lined up before the  footlights the house is full of disappearing backs.</p>
<p>Past, indeed, are the unruffled days when a heroine was  expected (after the action of a play had ended) to deliver the  closing ENVOI dear to the writers of Queen Anne&#x27;s day.   Thackeray writes:-</p>
<p>THE PLAY IS DONE!  THE CURTAIN DROPS, SLOW FALLING TO THE PROMPTER&#x27;S BELL! A MOMENT YET THE ACTOR STOPS, AND LOOKS AROUND, TO SAY FAREWELL!</p>
<p>A comedian who attempted any such abuse of the situation to- day would find himself addressing empty benches.  Before he  had finished the first line of his epilogue, most of his  public would be housed in the rapid transit cars.  No talent,  no novelty holds our audiences to the end of a performance.</p>
<p>On the opening night of the opera season this winter, one  third of the &quot;boxes&quot; and orchestra stalls were vacant before  Romeo (who, being a foreigner, was taking his time) had  expired.</p>
<p>One overworked matron of my acquaintance has perfected an  ingenious and time-saving combination.  By signalling from a  window near her opera box to a footman below, she is able to  get her carriage at least two minutes sooner than her  neighbors.</p>
<p>During the last act of an opera like TANN-HAUSER or FAUST, in  which the inconsiderate composer has placed a musical gem at  the end, this lady is worth watching.  After getting into her  wraps and overshoes she stands, hand on the door, at the back  of her box, listening to the singers; at a certain moment she  hurries to the window, makes her signal, scurries back, hears  Calve pour her soul out in ANGES PURS, ANGES RADIEUX, yet  manages to get down the stairs and into her carriage before  the curtain has fallen.</p>
<p>We deplore the prevailing habit of &quot;slouch&quot;; yet if you think  of it, this universal hurry is the cause of it.  Our cities  are left unsightly, because we cannot spare time to beautify  them.  Nervous diseases are distressingly prevalent; still we  hurry! hurry!! hurry!!! until, as a diplomatist recently  remarked to me, the whole nation seemed to him to be but five  minutes ahead of an apoplectic fit.</p>
<p>The curious part of the matter is that after several weeks at  home, much that was strange at first becomes quite natural to  the traveller, who finds himself thinking with pity of  benighted foreigners and their humdrum ways, and would resent  any attempts at reform.</p>
<p>What, for instance, would replace for enterprising souls the  joy of taking their matutinal car at a flying leap, or the  rapture of being first out of a theatre?  What does part of a  last act or the &quot;star song&quot; matter in comparison with five  minutes of valuable time to the good?  Like the river  captains, we propose to run under full head of steam and get  there, or b- explode!</p>
<p>Chapter 33 - The Spirit of History</p>
<p>BUILDINGS become tombs when the race that constructed them has  disappeared.  Libraries and manuscripts are catacombs where  most of us might wander in the dark forever, finding no issue.   To know dead generations and their environments through these  channels, to feel a love so strong that it calls the past  forth from its winding-sheet, and gives it life again, as  Christ did Lazarus, is the privilege only of great historians.</p>
<p>France is honoring the memory of such a man at this moment;  one who for forty years sought the vital spark of his  country&#x27;s existence, striving to resuscitate what he called  &quot;the great soul of history,&quot; as it developed through  successive acts of the vast drama.  This employment of his  genius is Michelet&#x27;s title to fame.</p>
<p>In a sombre structure, the tall windows of which look across  the Luxembourg trees to the Pantheon, where her husband&#x27;s bust  has recently been placed, a widow preserves with religious  care the souvenirs of this great historian.  Nothing that can  recall either his life or his labor is changed.</p>
<p>Madame Michelet&#x27;s life is in strange contrast with the ways of  the modern spouse who, under pretext of grief, discards and  displaces every reminder of the dead.  In our day, when the  great art is to forget, an existence consecrated to a memory  is so rare that the world might be the better for knowing that  a woman lives who, young and beautiful, was happy in the  society of an old man, whose genius she appreciated and  cherished, who loves him dead as she loved him living.  By her  care the apartment remains as it stood when he left it, to die  at Hyeres, - the furniture, the paintings, the writing-table.   No stranger has sat in his chair, no acquaintance has drunk  from his cup.  This woman, who was a perfect wife and now  fills one&#x27;s ideal of what a widow&#x27;s life should be, has  constituted herself the vigilant guardian of her husband&#x27;s  memory.  She loves to talk of the illustrious dead, and tell  how he was fond of saying that Virgil and Vico were his  parents.  Any one who reads the GEORGICS or THE BIRD will see  the truth of this, for he loved all created things, his ardent  spiritism perceiving that the essence which moved the ocean&#x27;s  tides was the same that sang in the robin at the window during  his last illness, which he called his &quot;little captive soul.&quot;</p>
<p>The author of LA BIBLE DE L&#x27;HUMANITE had to a supreme degree  the love of country, and possessed the power of reincarnating  with each succeeding cycle of its history.  So luminous was  his mind, so profound and far-reaching his sympathy, that he  understood the obscure workings of the mediaeval mind as  clearly as he appreciated Mirabeau&#x27;s transcendent genius.  He  believed that humanity, like Prometheus, was self-made; that  nations modelled their own destiny during the actions and  reactions of history, as each one of us acquires a personality  through the struggles and temptations of existence, by the  evolving power every soul carries within itself.</p>
<p>Michelet taught that each nation was the hero of its own  drama; that great men have not been different from the rest of  their race - on the contrary, being the condensation of an  epoch, that, no matter what the apparent eccentricities of a  leader may have been, he was the expression of a people&#x27;s  spirit.  This discovery that a race is transformed by its  action upon itself and upon the elements it absorbs from  without, wipes away at a stroke the popular belief in  &quot;predestined races&quot; or providential &quot;great men&quot; appearing at  crucial moments and riding victorious across the world.</p>
<p>An historian, if what he writes is to have any value, must  know the people, the one great historical factor.  Radicalism  in history is the beginning of truth.  Guided by this light of  his own, Michelet discovered a fresh factor heretofore  unnoticed, that vast fermentation which in France transforms  all foreign elements into an integral part of the country&#x27;s  being.  After studying his own land through the thirteen  centuries of her growth, from the chart of Childebert to the  will of Louis XVI., Michelet declared that while England is a  composite empire and Germany a region, France is a  personality.  In consequence he regarded the history of his  country as a long dramatic poem.  Here we reach the inner  thought of the historian, the secret impulse that guided his  majestic pen.</p>
<p>The veritable hero of his splendid Iliad is at first ignorant  and obscure, seeking passionately like OEdipus to know  himself.  The interest of the piece is absorbing.  We can  follow the gradual development of his nature as it becomes  more attractive and sympathetic with each advancing age,  until, through the hundred acts of the tragedy, he achieves a  soul.  For Michelet to write the history of his country was to  describe the long evolution of a hero.  He was fond of telling  his friends that during the Revolution of July, while he was  making his translation of Vico, this great fact was revealed  to him in the blazing vision of a people in revolt.  At that  moment the young and unknown author resolved to devote his  life, his talents, his gift of clairvoyance, the magic of his  inimitable style and creative genius, to fixing on paper the  features seen in his vision.</p>
<p>Conceived and executed in this spirit, his history could be  but a stupendous epic, and proves once again the truth of  Aristotle&#x27;s assertion that there is often greater truth in  poetry than in prose.</p>
<p>Seeking in the remote past for the origin of his hero,  Michelet pauses first before THE CATHEDRAL.  The poem begins  like some mediaeval tale.  The first years of his youthful  country are devoted to a mystic religion.  Under his ardent  hands vast naves rise and belfries touch the clouds.  It is  but a sad and cramped development, however; statutes restrain  his young ardor and chill his blood.  It is not until the boy  is behind the plough in the fields and sunlight that his real  life begins - a poor, brutish existence, if you will, but  still life.  The &quot;Jacques,&quot; half man and half beast, of the  Middle Ages is the result of a thousand years of suffering.</p>
<p>A woman&#x27;s voice calls this brute to arms.  An enemy is  overrunning the land.  Joan the virgin - &quot;my Joan,&quot; Michelet  calls her - whose heart bleeds when blood is shed, frees her  country.  A shadow, however, soon obscures this gracious  vision from Jacques&#x27;s eyes.  The vast monarchical incubus  rises between the people and their ideal.  Our historian turns  in disgust from the later French kings.  He has neither time  nor heart to write their history, so passes quickly from Louis  XI. to the great climax of his drama - the Revolution.  There  we find his hero, emerging at last from tyranny and  oppression.  Freedom and happiness are before him.  Alas! his  eyes, accustomed to the dim light of dungeons, are dazzled by  the sun of liberty; he strikes friend and foe alike.</p>
<p>In the solitary galleries of the &quot;Archives&quot; Michelet communes  with the great spirits of that day, Desaix, Marceau, Kleber, -  elder sons of the Republic, who whisper many secrets to their  pupil as he turns over faded pages tied with tri-colored  ribbons, where the cities of France have written their  affection for liberty, love-letters from Jacques to his  mistress.  Michelet is happy.  His long labor is drawing to an  end.  The great epic which he has followed as it developed  through the centuries is complete.  His hero stands hand in  hand before the altar with the spouse of his choice, for whose  smile he has toiled and struggled.  The poet-historian sees  again in the FETE DE LA FEDERATION the radiant face of his  vision, the true face of France, LA DULCE.</p>
<p>Through all the lyricism of this master&#x27;s work one feels that  he has &quot;lived&quot; history as he wrote it, following his subject  from its obscure genesis to a radiant apotheosis.  The  faithful companion of Michelet&#x27;s age has borne witness to this  power which he possessed of projecting himself into another  age and living with his subject.  She repeats to those who  know her how he trembled in passion and burned with patriotic  emotion in transcribing the crucial pages of his country&#x27;s  history, rejoicing in her successes and depressed by her  faults, like the classic historian who refused with horror to  tell the story of his compatriots&#x27; defeat at Cannae, saying,  &quot;I could not survive the recital.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you remember,&quot; a friend once asked Madame Michelet, &quot;how,  when your husband was writing his chapters on the Reign of  Terror, he ended by falling ill?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; she replied.  &quot;That was the week he executed  Danton.  We were living in the country near Nantes.  The  ground was covered with snow.  I can see him now, hurrying to  and fro under the bare trees, gesticulating and crying as he  walked, <code>How can I judge them, those great men?  How can I  judge them?&#x27;  It was in this way that he threw his </code>thousand  souls&#x27; into the past and lived in sympathy with all men, an  apostle of universal love.  After one of these fecund hours he  would drop into his chair and murmur, `I am crushed by this  work.  I have been writing with my blood!&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>Alas, his aged eyes were destined to read sadder pages than he  had ever written, to see years as tragic as the &quot;Terror.&quot;  He  lived to hear the recital of (having refused to witness) his  country&#x27;s humiliation, and fell one April morning, in his  retirement near Pisa, unconscious under the double shock of  invasion and civil war.  Though he recovered later, his  horizon remained dark.  The patriot suffered to see party  spirit and warring factions rending the nation he had so often  called the pilot of humanity&#x27;s bark, which seemed now to be  going straight on the rocks.  &quot;FINIS GALLIAE,&quot; murmured the  historian, who to the end lived and died with his native land.</p>
<p>Thousands yearly mount the broad steps of the Pantheon to lay  their wreaths upon his tomb, and thousands more in every  Gallic schoolroom are daily learning, in the pages of his  history, to love FRANCE LA DULCE.</p>
