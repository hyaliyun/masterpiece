<p>by Horace Walpole</p>
<p>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</p>
<p>THE following work was found in the library of an ancient Catholic  family in the north of England.  It was printed at Naples, in the  black letter, in the year 1529.  How much sooner it was written does  not appear.  The principal incidents are such as were believed in the  darkest ages of Christianity; but the language and conduct have  nothing that savours of barbarism.  The style is the purest Italian.</p>
<p>If the story was written near the time when it is supposed to have  happened, it must have been between 1095, the era of the first  Crusade, and 1243, the date of the last, or not long afterwards.   There is no other circumstance in the work that can lead us to guess  at the period in which the scene is laid:  the names of the actors are  evidently fictitious, and probably disguised on purpose:  yet the  Spanish names of the domestics seem to indicate that this work was not  composed until the establishment of the Arragonian Kings in Naples had  made Spanish appellations familiar in that country.  The beauty of the  diction, and the zeal of the author (moderated, however, by singular  judgment) concur to make me think that the date of the composition was  little antecedent to that of the impression.  Letters were then in  their most flourishing state in Italy, and contributed to dispel the  empire of superstition, at that time so forcibly attacked by the  reformers.  It is not unlikely that an artful priest might endeavour  to turn their own arms on the innovators, and might avail himself of  his abilities as an author to confirm the populace in their ancient  errors and superstitions.  If this was his view, he has certainly  acted with signal address.  Such a work as the following would enslave  a hundred vulgar minds beyond half the books of controversy that have  been written from the days of Luther to the present hour.</p>
<p>This solution of the author&#x27;s motives is, however, offered as a mere  conjecture.  Whatever his views were, or whatever effects the  execution of them might have, his work can only be laid before the  public at present as a matter of entertainment.  Even as such, some  apology for it is necessary.  Miracles, visions, necromancy, dreams,  and other preternatural events, are exploded now even from romances.   That was not the case when our author wrote; much less when the story  itself is supposed to have happened.  Belief in every kind of prodigy  was so established in those dark ages, that an author would not be  faithful to the manners of the times, who should omit all mention of  them.  He is not bound to believe them himself, but he must represent  his actors as believing them.</p>
<p>If this air of the miraculous is excused, the reader will find nothing  else unworthy of his perusal.  Allow the possibility of the facts, and  all the actors comport themselves as persons would do in their  situation.  There is no bombast, no similes, flowers, digressions, or  unnecessary descriptions.  Everything tends directly to the  catastrophe.  Never is the reader&#x27;s attention relaxed.  The rules of  the drama are almost observed throughout the conduct of the piece.   The characters are well drawn, and still better maintained.  Terror,  the author&#x27;s principal engine, prevents the story from ever  languishing; and it is so often contrasted by pity, that the mind is  kept up in a constant vicissitude of interesting passions.</p>
<p>Some persons may perhaps think the characters of the domestics too  little serious for the general cast of the story; but besides their  opposition to the principal personages, the art of the author is very  observable in his conduct of the subalterns.  They discover many  passages essential to the story, which could not be well brought to  light but by their NAIVETE and simplicity.  In particular, the  womanish terror and foibles of Bianca, in the last chapter, conduce  essentially towards advancing the catastrophe.</p>
<p>It is natural for a translator to be prejudiced in favour of his  adopted work.  More impartial readers may not be so much struck with  the beauties of this piece as I was.  Yet I am not blind to my  author&#x27;s defects.  I could wish he had grounded his plan on a more  useful moral than this:  that &quot;the sins of fathers are visited on  their children to the third and fourth generation.&quot;  I doubt whether,  in his time, any more than at present, ambition curbed its appetite of  dominion from the dread of so remote a punishment.  And yet this moral  is weakened by that less direct insinuation, that even such anathema  may be diverted by devotion to St. Nicholas.  Here the interest of the  Monk plainly gets the better of the judgment of the author.  However,  with all its faults, I have no doubt but the English reader will be  pleased with a sight of this performance.  The piety that reigns  throughout, the lessons of virtue that are inculcated, and the rigid  purity of the sentiments, exempt this work from the censure to which  romances are but too liable.  Should it meet with the success I hope  for, I may be encouraged to reprint the original Italian, though it  will tend to depreciate my own labour.  Our language falls far short  of the charms of the Italian, both for variety and harmony.  The  latter is peculiarly excellent for simple narrative.  It is difficult  in English to relate without falling too low or rising too high; a  fault obviously occasioned by the little care taken to speak pure  language in common conversation.  Every Italian or Frenchman of any  rank piques himself on speaking his own tongue correctly and with  choice.  I cannot flatter myself with having done justice to my author  in this respect:  his style is as elegant as his conduct of the  passions is masterly.  It is a pity that he did not apply his talents  to what they were evidently proper for - the theatre.</p>
<p>I will detain the reader no longer, but to make one short remark.   Though the machinery is invention, and the names of the actors  imaginary, I cannot but believe that the groundwork of the story is  founded on truth.  The scene is undoubtedly laid in some real castle.   The author seems frequently, without design, to describe particular  parts.  &quot;The chamber,&quot; says he, &quot;on the right hand;&quot; &quot;the door on the  left hand;&quot; &quot;the distance from the chapel to Conrad&#x27;s apartment:&quot;  these and other passages are strong presumptions that the author had  some certain building in his eye.  Curious persons, who have leisure  to employ in such researches, may possibly discover in the Italian  writers the foundation on which our author has built.  If a  catastrophe, at all resembling that which he describes, is believed to  have given rise to this work, it will contribute to interest the  reader, and will make the &quot;Castle of Otranto a still more moving  story.</p>
<p>SONNET TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY MARY COKE.</p>
<p>THE gentle maid, whose hapless tale These melancholy pages speak; Say, gracious lady, shall she fail To draw the tear adown thy cheek?</p>
<p>No; never was thy pitying breast Insensible to human woes; Tender, tho&#x27; firm, it melts distrest For weaknesses it never knows.</p>
<p>Oh! guard the marvels I relate Of fell ambition scourg&#x27;d by fate, From reason&#x27;s peevish blame. Blest with thy smile, my dauntless sail I dare expand to Fancy&#x27;s gale, For sure thy smiles are Fame.</p>
<p>H. W.</p>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<p>MANFRED, Prince of Otranto, had one son and one daughter:  the latter,  a most beautiful virgin, aged eighteen, was called Matilda.  Conrad,  the son, was three years younger, a homely youth, sickly, and of no  promising disposition; yet he was the darling of his father, who never  showed any symptoms of affection to Matilda.  Manfred had contracted a  marriage for his son with the Marquis of Vicenza&#x27;s daughter, Isabella;  and she had already been delivered by her guardians into the hands of  Manfred, that he might celebrate the wedding as soon as Conrad&#x27;s  infirm state of health would permit.</p>
<p>Manfred&#x27;s impatience for this ceremonial was remarked by his family  and neighbours.  The former, indeed, apprehending the severity of  their Prince&#x27;s disposition, did not dare to utter their surmises on  this precipitation.  Hippolita, his wife, an amiable lady, did  sometimes venture to represent the danger of marrying their only son  so early, considering his great youth, and greater infirmities; but  she never received any other answer than reflections on her own  sterility, who had given him but one heir.  His tenants and subjects  were less cautious in their discourses.  They attributed this hasty  wedding to the Prince&#x27;s dread of seeing accomplished an ancient  prophecy, which was said to have pronounced that the castle and  lordship of Otranto &quot;should pass from the present family, whenever the  real owner should be grown too large to inhabit it.&quot;  It was difficult  to make any sense of this prophecy; and still less easy to conceive  what it had to do with the marriage in question.  Yet these mysteries,  or contradictions, did not make the populace adhere the less to their  opinion.</p>
<p>Young Conrad&#x27;s birthday was fixed for his espousals.  The company was  assembled in the chapel of the Castle, and everything ready for  beginning the divine office, when Conrad himself was missing.   Manfred, impatient of the least delay, and who had not observed his  son retire, despatched one of his attendants to summon the young  Prince.  The servant, who had not stayed long enough to have crossed  the court to Conrad&#x27;s apartment, came running back breathless, in a  frantic manner, his eyes staring, and foaming at the month.  He said  nothing, but pointed to the court.</p>
<p>The company were struck with terror and amazement.  The Princess  Hippolita, without knowing what was the matter, but anxious for her  son, swooned away.  Manfred, less apprehensive than enraged at the  procrastination of the nuptials, and at the folly of his domestic,  asked imperiously what was the matter?  The fellow made no answer, but  continued pointing towards the court-yard; and at last, after repeated  questions put to him, cried out, &quot;Oh! the helmet! the helmet!&quot;</p>
<p>In the meantime, some of the company had run into the court, from  whence was heard a confused noise of shrieks, horror, and surprise.   Manfred, who began to be alarmed at not seeing his son, went himself  to get information of what occasioned this strange confusion.  Matilda  remained endeavouring to assist her mother, and Isabella stayed for  the same purpose, and to avoid showing any impatience for the  bridegroom, for whom, in truth, she had conceived little affection.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck Manfred&#x27;s eyes was a group of his servants  endeavouring to raise something that appeared to him a mountain of  sable plumes.  He gazed without believing his sight.</p>
<p>&quot;What are ye doing?&quot; cried Manfred, wrathfully; &quot;where is my son?&quot;</p>
<p>A volley of voices replied, &quot;Oh! my Lord! the Prince! the Prince! the  helmet! the helmet!&quot;</p>
<p>Shocked with these lamentable sounds, and dreading he knew not what,  he advanced hastily, - but what a sight for a father&#x27;s eyes! - he  beheld his child dashed to pieces, and almost buried under an enormous  helmet, an hundred times more large than any casque ever made for  human being, and shaded with a proportionable quantity of black  feathers.</p>
<p>The horror of the spectacle, the ignorance of all around how this  misfortune had happened, and above all, the tremendous phenomenon  before him, took away the Prince&#x27;s speech.  Yet his silence lasted  longer than even grief could occasion.  He fixed his eyes on what he  wished in vain to believe a vision; and seemed less attentive to his  loss, than buried in meditation on the stupendous object that had  occasioned it.  He touched, he examined the fatal casque; nor could  even the bleeding mangled remains of the young Prince divert the eyes  of Manfred from the portent before him.</p>
<p>All who had known his partial fondness for young Conrad, were as much  surprised at their Prince&#x27;s insensibility, as thunderstruck themselves  at the miracle of the helmet.  They conveyed the disfigured corpse  into the hall, without receiving the least direction from Manfred.  As  little was he attentive to the ladies who remained in the chapel.  On  the contrary, without mentioning the unhappy princesses, his wife and  daughter, the first sounds that dropped from Manfred&#x27;s lips were,  &quot;Take care of the Lady Isabella.&quot;</p>
<p>The domestics, without observing the singularity of this direction,  were guided by their affection to their mistress, to consider it as  peculiarly addressed to her situation, and flew to her assistance.   They conveyed her to her chamber more dead than alive, and indifferent  to all the strange circumstances she heard, except the death of her  son.</p>
<p>Matilda, who doted on her mother, smothered her own grief and  amazement, and thought of nothing but assisting and comforting her  afflicted parent.  Isabella, who had been treated by Hippolita like a  daughter, and who returned that tenderness with equal duty and  affection, was scarce less assiduous about the Princess; at the same  time endeavouring to partake and lessen the weight of sorrow which she  saw Matilda strove to suppress, for whom she had conceived the warmest  sympathy of friendship.  Yet her own situation could not help finding  its place in her thoughts.  She felt no concern for the death of young  Conrad, except commiseration; and she was not sorry to be delivered  from a marriage which had promised her little felicity, either from  her destined bridegroom, or from the severe temper of Manfred, who,  though he had distinguished her by great indulgence, had imprinted her  mind with terror, from his causeless rigour to such amiable princesses  as Hippolita and Matilda.</p>
<p>While the ladies were conveying the wretched mother to her bed,  Manfred remained in the court, gazing on the ominous casque, and  regardless of the crowd which the strangeness of the event had now  assembled around him.  The few words he articulated, tended solely to  inquiries, whether any man knew from whence it could have come?   Nobody could give him the least information.  However, as it seemed to  be the sole object of his curiosity, it soon became so to the rest of  the spectators, whose conjectures were as absurd and improbable, as  the catastrophe itself was unprecedented.  In the midst of their  senseless guesses, a young peasant, whom rumour had drawn thither from  a neighbouring village, observed that the miraculous helmet was  exactly like that on the figure in black marble of Alfonso the Good,  one of their former princes, in the church of St. Nicholas.</p>
<p>&quot;Villain!  What sayest thou?&quot; cried Manfred, starting from his trance  in a tempest of rage, and seizing the young man by the collar; &quot;how  darest thou utter such treason?  Thy life shall pay for it.&quot;</p>
<p>The spectators, who as little comprehended the cause of the Prince&#x27;s  fury as all the rest they had seen, were at a loss to unravel this new  circumstance.  The young peasant himself was still more astonished,  not conceiving how he had offended the Prince.  Yet recollecting  himself, with a mixture of grace and humility, he disengaged himself  from Manfred&#x27;s grip, and then with an obeisance, which discovered more  jealousy of innocence than dismay, he asked, with respect, of what he  was guilty?  Manfred, more enraged at the vigour, however decently  exerted, with which the young man had shaken off his hold, than  appeased by his submission, ordered his attendants to seize him, and,  if he had not been withheld by his friends whom he had invited to the  nuptials, would have poignarded the peasant in their arms.</p>
<p>During this altercation, some of the vulgar spectators had run to the  great church, which stood near the castle, and came back open-mouthed,  declaring that the helmet was missing from Alfonso&#x27;s statue.  Manfred,  at this news, grew perfectly frantic; and, as if he sought a subject  on which to vent the tempest within him, he rushed again on the young  peasant, crying -</p>
<p>&quot;Villain! Monster! Sorcerer! &#x27;tis thou hast done this! &#x27;tis thou hast  slain my son!&quot;</p>
<p>The mob, who wanted some object within the scope of their capacities,  on whom they might discharge their bewildered reasoning, caught the  words from the mouth of their lord, and re-echoed -</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, ay; &#x27;tis he, &#x27;tis he:  he has stolen the helmet from good  Alfonso&#x27;s tomb, and dashed out the brains of our young Prince with  it,&quot; never reflecting how enormous the disproportion was between the  marble helmet that had been in the church, and that of steel before  their eyes; nor how impossible it was for a youth seemingly not  twenty, to wield a piece of armour of so prodigious a weight</p>
<p>The folly of these ejaculations brought Manfred to himself:  yet  whether provoked at the peasant having observed the resemblance  between the two helmets, and thereby led to the farther discovery of  the absence of that in the church, or wishing to bury any such rumour  under so impertinent a supposition, he gravely pronounced that the  young man was certainly a necromancer, and that till the Church could  take cognisance of the affair, he would have the Magician, whom they  had thus detected, kept prisoner under the helmet itself, which he  ordered his attendants to raise, and place the young man under it;  declaring he should be kept there without food, with which his own  infernal art might furnish him.</p>
<p>It was in vain for the youth to represent against this preposterous  sentence:  in vain did Manfred&#x27;s friends endeavour to divert him from  this savage and ill-grounded resolution.  The generality were charmed  with their lord&#x27;s decision, which, to their apprehensions, carried  great appearance of justice, as the Magician was to be punished by the  very instrument with which he had offended:  nor were they struck with  the least compunction at the probability of the youth being starved,  for they firmly believed that, by his diabolic skill, he could easily  supply himself with nutriment.</p>
<p>Manfred thus saw his commands even cheerfully obeyed; and appointing a  guard with strict orders to prevent any food being conveyed to the  prisoner, he dismissed his friends and attendants, and retired to his  own chamber, after locking the gates of the castle, in which he  suffered none but his domestics to remain.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the care and zeal of the young Ladies had brought the  Princess Hippolita to herself, who amidst the transports of her own  sorrow frequently demanded news of her lord, would have dismissed her  attendants to watch over him, and at last enjoined Matilda to leave  her, and visit and comfort her father.  Matilda, who wanted no  affectionate duty to Manfred, though she trembled at his austerity,  obeyed the orders of Hippolita, whom she tenderly recommended to  Isabella; and inquiring of the domestics for her father, was informed  that he was retired to his chamber, and had commanded that nobody  should have admittance to him.  Concluding that he was immersed in  sorrow for the death of her brother, and fearing to renew his tears by  the sight of his sole remaining child, she hesitated whether she  should break in upon his affliction; yet solicitude for him, backed by  the commands of her mother, encouraged her to venture disobeying the  orders he had given; a fault she had never been guilty of before.</p>
<p>The gentle timidity of her nature made her pause for some minutes at  his door.  She heard him traverse his chamber backwards, and forwards  with disordered steps; a mood which increased her apprehensions.  She  was, however, just going to beg admittance, when Manfred suddenly  opened the door; and as it was now twilight, concurring with the  disorder of his mind, he did not distinguish the person, but asked  angrily, who it was?  Matilda replied, trembling -</p>
<p>&quot;My dearest father, it is I, your daughter.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, stepping back hastily, cried, &quot;Begone!  I do not want a  daughter;&quot; and flinging back abruptly, clapped the door against the  terrified Matilda.</p>
<p>She was too well acquainted with her father&#x27;s impetuosity to venture a  second intrusion.  When she had a little recovered the shock of so  bitter a reception, she wiped away her tears to prevent the additional  stab that the knowledge of it would give to Hippolita, who questioned  her in the most anxious terms on the health of Manfred, and how he  bore his loss.  Matilda assured her he was well, and supported his  misfortune with manly fortitude.</p>
<p>&quot;But will he not let me see him?&quot; said Hippolita mournfully; &quot;will he  not permit me to blend my tears with his, and shed a mother&#x27;s sorrows  in the bosom of her Lord?  Or do you deceive me, Matilda?  I know how  Manfred doted on his son:  is not the stroke too heavy for him? has he  not sunk under it?  You do not answer me - alas! I dread the worst! -  Raise me, my maidens; I will, I will see my Lord.  Bear me to him  instantly:  he is dearer to me even than my children.&quot;</p>
<p>Matilda made signs to Isabella to prevent Hippolita&#x27;s rising; and both  those lovely young women were using their gentle violence to stop and  calm the Princess, when a servant, on the part of Manfred, arrived and  told Isabella that his Lord demanded to speak with her.</p>
<p>&quot;With me!&quot; cried Isabella.</p>
<p>&quot;Go,&quot; said Hippolita, relieved by a message from her Lord:  &quot;Manfred  cannot support the sight of his own family.  He thinks you less  disordered than we are, and dreads the shock of my grief.  Console  him, dear Isabella, and tell him I will smother my own anguish rather  than add to his.&quot;</p>
<p>As it was now evening the servant who conducted Isabella bore a torch  before her.  When they came to Manfred, who was walking impatiently  about the gallery, he started, and said hastily -</p>
<p>&quot;Take away that light, and begone.&quot;</p>
<p>Then shutting the door impetuously, he flung himself upon a bench  against the wall, and bade Isabella sit by him.  She obeyed trembling.</p>
<p>&quot;I sent for you, Lady,&quot; said he - and then stopped under great  appearance of confusion.</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I sent for you on a matter of great moment,&quot; resumed he.  &quot;Dry  your tears, young Lady - you have lost your bridegroom.  Yes, cruel  fate! and I have lost the hopes of my race!  But Conrad was not worthy  of your beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How, my Lord!&quot; said Isabella; &quot;sure you do not suspect me of not  feeling the concern I ought:  my duty and affection would have always  - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Think no more of him,&quot; interrupted Manfred; &quot;he was a sickly, puny  child, and Heaven has perhaps taken him away, that I might not trust  the honours of my house on so frail a foundation.  The line of Manfred  calls for numerous supports.  My foolish fondness for that boy blinded  the eyes of my prudence - but it is better as it is.  I hope, in a few  years, to have reason to rejoice at the death of Conrad.&quot;</p>
<p>Words cannot paint the astonishment of Isabella.  At first she  apprehended that grief had disordered Manfred&#x27;s understanding.  Her  next thought suggested that this strange discourse was designed to  ensnare her:  she feared that Manfred had perceived her indifference  for his son:  and in consequence of that idea she replied -</p>
<p>&quot;Good my Lord, do not doubt my tenderness:  my heart would have  accompanied my hand.  Conrad would have engrossed all my care; and  wherever fate shall dispose of me, I shall always cherish his memory,  and regard your Highness and the virtuous Hippolita as my parents.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Curse on Hippolita!&quot; cried Manfred.  &quot;Forget her from this moment, as  I do.  In short, Lady, you have missed a husband undeserving of your  charms:  they shall now be better disposed of.  Instead of a sickly  boy, you shall have a husband in the prime of his age, who will know  how to value your beauties, and who may expect a numerous offspring.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas, my Lord!&quot; said Isabella, &quot;my mind is too sadly engrossed by the  recent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage.  If  ever my father returns, and it shall be his pleasure, I shall obey, as  I did when I consented to give my hand to your son:  but until his  return, permit me to remain under your hospitable roof, and employ the  melancholy hours in assuaging yours, Hippolita&#x27;s, and the fair  Matilda&#x27;s affliction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I desired you once before,&quot; said Manfred angrily, &quot;not to name that  woman:  from this hour she must be a stranger to you, as she must be  to me.  In short, Isabella, since I cannot give you my son, I offer  you myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heavens!&quot; cried Isabella, waking from her delusion, &quot;what do I hear?   You! my Lord!  You!  My father-in-law! the father of Conrad! the  husband of the virtuous and tender Hippolita!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I tell you,&quot; said Manfred imperiously, &quot;Hippolita is no longer my  wife; I divorce her from this hour.  Too long has she cursed me by her  unfruitfulness.  My fate depends on having sons, and this night I  trust will give a new date to my hopes.&quot;</p>
<p>At those words he seized the cold hand of Isabella, who was half dead  with fright and horror.  She shrieked, and started from him, Manfred  rose to pursue her, when the moon, which was now up, and gleamed in at  the opposite casement, presented to his sight the plumes of the fatal  helmet, which rose to the height of the windows, waving backwards and  forwards in a tempestuous manner, and accompanied with a hollow and  rustling sound.  Isabella, who gathered courage from her situation,  and who dreaded nothing so much as Manfred&#x27;s pursuit of his  declaration, cried -</p>
<p>&quot;Look, my Lord! see, Heaven itself declares against your impious  intentions!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heaven nor Hell shall impede my designs,&quot; said Manfred, advancing  again to seize the Princess.</p>
<p>At that instant the portrait of his grandfather, which hung over the  bench where they had been sitting, uttered a deep sigh, and heaved its  breast.</p>
<p>Isabella, whose back was turned to the picture, saw not the motion,  nor knew whence the sound came, but started, and said -</p>
<p>&quot;Hark, my Lord!  What sound was that?&quot; and at the same time made  towards the door.</p>
<p>Manfred, distracted between the flight of Isabella, who had now  reached the stairs, and yet unable to keep his eyes from the picture,  which began to move, had, however, advanced some steps after her,  still looking backwards on the portrait, when he saw it quit its  panel, and descend on the floor with a grave and melancholy air.</p>
<p>&quot;Do I dream?&quot; cried Manfred, returning; &quot;or are the devils themselves  in league against me?  Speak, internal spectre!  Or, if thou art my  grandsire, why dost thou too conspire against thy wretched descendant,  who too dearly pays for - &quot;  Ere he could finish the sentence, the  vision sighed again, and made a sign to Manfred to follow him.</p>
<p>&quot;Lead on!&quot; cried Manfred; &quot;I will follow thee to the gulf of  perdition.&quot;</p>
<p>The spectre marched sedately, but dejected, to the end of the gallery,  and turned into a chamber on the right hand.  Manfred accompanied him  at a little distance, full of anxiety and horror, but resolved.  As he  would have entered the chamber, the door was clapped to with violence  by an invisible hand.  The Prince, collecting courage from this delay,  would have forcibly burst open the door with his foot, but found that  it resisted his utmost efforts.</p>
<p>&quot;Since Hell will not satisfy my curiosity,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;I will use  the human means in my power for preserving my race; Isabella shall not  escape me.&quot;</p>
<p>The lady, whose resolution had given way to terror the moment she had  quitted Manfred, continued her flight to the bottom of the principal  staircase.  There she stopped, not knowing whither to direct her  steps, nor how to escape from the impetuosity of the Prince.  The  gates of the castle, she knew, were locked, and guards placed in the  court.  Should she, as her heart prompted her, go and prepare  Hippolita for the cruel destiny that awaited her, she did not doubt  but Manfred would seek her there, and that his violence would incite  him to double the injury he meditated, without leaving room for them  to avoid the impetuosity of his passions.  Delay might give him time  to reflect on the horrid measures he had conceived, or produce some  circumstance in her favour, if she could - for that night, at least -  avoid his odious purpose.  Yet where conceal herself?  How avoid the  pursuit he would infallibly make throughout the castle?</p>
<p>As these thoughts passed rapidly through her mind, she recollected a  subterraneous passage which led from the vaults of the castle to the  church of St. Nicholas.  Could she reach the altar before she was  overtaken, she knew even Manfred&#x27;s violence would not dare to profane  the sacredness of the place; and she determined, if no other means of  deliverance offered, to shut herself up for ever among the holy  virgins whose convent was contiguous to the cathedral.  In this  resolution, she seized a lamp that burned at the foot of the  staircase, and hurried towards the secret passage.</p>
<p>The lower part of the castle was hollowed into several intricate  cloisters; and it was not easy for one under so much anxiety to find  the door that opened into the cavern.  An awful silence reigned  throughout those subterraneous regions, except now and then some  blasts of wind that shook the doors she had passed, and which, grating  on the rusty hinges, were re-echoed through that long labyrinth of  darkness.  Every murmur struck her with new terror; yet more she  dreaded to hear the wrathful voice of Manfred urging his domestics to  pursue her.</p>
<p>She trod as softly as impatience would give her leave, yet frequently  stopped and listened to hear if she was followed.  In one of those  moments she thought she heard a sigh.  She shuddered, and recoiled a  few paces.  In a moment she thought she heard the step of some person.   Her blood curdled; she concluded it was Manfred.  Every suggestion  that horror could inspire rushed into her mind.  She condemned her  rash flight, which had thus exposed her to his rage in a place where  her cries were not likely to draw anybody to her assistance.  Yet the  sound seemed not to come from behind.  If Manfred knew where she was,  he must have followed her.  She was still in one of the cloisters, and  the steps she had heard were too distinct to proceed from the way she  had come.  Cheered with this reflection, and hoping to find a friend  in whoever was not the Prince, she was going to advance, when a door  that stood ajar, at some distance to the left, was opened gently:  but  ere her lamp, which she held up, could discover who opened it, the  person retreated precipitately on seeing the light.</p>
<p>Isabella, whom every incident was sufficient to dismay, hesitated  whether she should proceed.  Her dread of Manfred soon outweighed  every other terror.  The very circumstance of the person avoiding her  gave her a sort of courage.  It could only be, she thought, some  domestic belonging to the castle.  Her gentleness had never raised her  an enemy, and conscious innocence made her hope that, unless sent by  the Prince&#x27;s order to seek her, his servants would rather assist than  prevent her flight.  Fortifying herself with these reflections, and  believing by what she could observe that she was near the mouth of the  subterraneous cavern, she approached the door that had been opened;  but a sudden gust of wind that met her at the door extinguished her  lamp, and left her in total darkness.</p>
<p>Words cannot paint the horror of the Princess&#x27;s situation.  Alone in  so dismal a place, her mind imprinted with all the terrible events of  the day, hopeless of escaping, expecting every moment the arrival of  Manfred, and far from tranquil on knowing she was within reach of  somebody, she knew not whom, who for some cause seemed concealed  thereabouts; all these thoughts crowded on her distracted mind, and  she was ready to sink under her apprehensions.  She addressed herself  to every saint in heaven, and inwardly implored their assistance.  For  a considerable time she remained in an agony of despair.</p>
<p>At last, as softly as was possible, she felt for the door, and having  found it, entered trembling into the vault from whence she had heard  the sigh and steps.  It gave her a kind of momentary joy to perceive  an imperfect ray of clouded moonshine gleam from the roof of the  vault, which seemed to be fallen in, and from whence hung a fragment  of earth or building, she could not distinguish which, that appeared  to have been crushed inwards.  She advanced eagerly towards this  chasm, when she discerned a human form standing close against the  wall.</p>
<p>She shrieked, believing it the ghost of her betrothed Conrad.  The  figure, advancing, said, in a submissive voice -</p>
<p>&quot;Be not alarmed, Lady; I will not injure you.&quot;</p>
<p>Isabella, a little encouraged by the words and tone of voice of the  stranger, and recollecting that this must be the person who had opened  the door, recovered her spirits enough to reply -</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, whoever you are, take pity on a wretched Princess, standing on  the brink of destruction.  Assist me to escape from this fatal castle,  or in a few moments I may be made miserable for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas!&quot; said the stranger, &quot;what can I do to assist you?  I will die  in your defence; but I am unacquainted with the castle, and want - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Isabella, hastily interrupting him; &quot;help me but to find a  trap-door that must be hereabout, and it is the greatest service you  can do me, for I have not a minute to lose.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying a these words, she felt about on the pavement, and directed the  stranger to search likewise, for a smooth piece of brass enclosed in  one of the stones.</p>
<p>&quot;That,&quot; said she, &quot;is the lock, which opens with a spring, of which I  know the secret.  If we can find that, I may escape - if not, alas!  courteous stranger, I fear I shall have involved you in my  misfortunes:  Manfred will suspect you for the accomplice of my  flight, and you will fall a victim to his resentment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I value not my life,&quot; said the stranger, &quot;and it will be some comfort  to lose it in trying to deliver you from his tyranny.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Generous youth,&quot; said Isabella, &quot;how shall I ever requite - &quot;</p>
<p>As she uttered those words, a ray of moonshine, streaming through a  cranny of the ruin above, shone directly on the lock they sought.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! transport!&quot; said Isabella; &quot;here is the trap-door!&quot; and, taking  out the key, she touched the spring, which, starting aside, discovered  an iron ring.  &quot;Lift up the door,&quot; said the Princess.</p>
<p>The stranger obeyed, and beneath appeared some stone steps descending  into a vault totally dark.</p>
<p>&quot;We must go down here,&quot; said Isabella.  &quot;Follow me; dark and dismal as  it is, we cannot miss our way; it leads directly to the church of St.  Nicholas.  But, perhaps,&quot; added the Princess modestly, &quot;you have no  reason to leave the castle, nor have I farther occasion for your  service; in a few minutes I shall be safe from Manfred&#x27;s rage - only  let me know to whom I am so much obliged.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will never quit you,&quot; said the stranger eagerly, &quot;until I have  placed you in safety - nor think me, Princess, more generous than I  am; though you are my principal care - &quot;</p>
<p>The stranger was interrupted by a sudden noise of voices that seemed  approaching, and they soon distinguished these words -</p>
<p>&quot;Talk not to me of necromancers; I tell you she must be in the castle;  I will find her in spite of enchantment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, heavens!&quot; cried Isabella; &quot;it is the voice of Manfred!  Make  haste, or we are ruined! and shut the trap-door after you.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, she descended the steps precipitately; and as the  stranger hastened to follow her, he let the door slip out of his  hands:  it fell, and the spring closed over it.  He tried in vain to  open it, not having observed Isabella&#x27;s method of touching the spring;  nor had he many moments to make an essay.  The noise of the falling  door had been heard by Manfred, who, directed by the sound, hastened  thither, attended by his servants with torches.</p>
<p>&quot;It must be Isabella,&quot; cried Manfred, before he entered the vault.   &quot;She is escaping by the subterraneous passage, but she cannot have got  far.&quot;</p>
<p>What was the astonishment of the Prince when, instead of Isabella, the  light of the torches discovered to him the young peasant whom he  thought confined under the fatal helmet!</p>
<p>&quot;Traitor!&quot; said Manfred; &quot;how camest thou here?  I thought thee in  durance above in the court.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am no traitor,&quot; replied the young man boldly, &quot;nor am I answerable  for your thoughts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Presumptuous villain!&quot; cried Manfred; &quot;dost thou provoke my wrath?   Tell me, how hast thou escaped from above?  Thou hast corrupted thy  guards, and their lives shall answer it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My poverty,&quot; said the peasant calmly, &quot;will disculpate them:  though  the ministers of a tyrant&#x27;s wrath, to thee they are faithful, and but  too willing to execute the orders which you unjustly imposed upon  them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Art thou so hardy as to dare my vengeance?&quot; said the Prince; &quot;but  tortures shall force the truth from thee.  Tell me; I will know thy  accomplices.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was my accomplice!&quot; said the youth, smiling, and pointing to  the roof.</p>
<p>Manfred ordered the torches to be held up, and perceived that one of  the cheeks of the enchanted casque had forced its way through the  pavement of the court, as his servants had let it fall over the  peasant, and had broken through into the vault, leaving a gap, through  which the peasant had pressed himself some minutes before he was found  by Isabella.</p>
<p>&quot;Was that the way by which thou didst descend?&quot; said Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;It was,&quot; said the youth.</p>
<p>&quot;But what noise was that,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;which I heard as I entered  the cloister?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A door clapped,&quot; said the peasant; &quot;I heard it as well as you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What door?&quot; said Manfred hastily.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not acquainted with your castle,&quot; said the peasant; &quot;this is the  first time I ever entered it, and this vault the only part of it  within which I ever was.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But I tell thee,&quot; said Manfred (wishing to find out if the youth had  discovered the trap-door), &quot;it was this way I heard the noise.  My  servants heard it too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; interrupted one of them officiously, &quot;to be sure it was the  trap-door, and he was going to make his escape.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Peace, blockhead!&quot; said the Prince angrily; &quot;if he was going to  escape, how should he come on this side?  I will know from his own  mouth what noise it was I heard.  Tell me truly; thy life depends on  thy veracity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My veracity is dearer to me than my life,&quot; said the peasant; &quot;nor  would I purchase the one by forfeiting the other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed, young philosopher!&quot; said Manfred contemptuously; &quot;tell me,  then, what was the noise I heard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ask me what I can answer,&quot; said he, &quot;and put me to death instantly if  I tell you a lie.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, growing impatient at the steady valour and indifference of  the youth, cried -</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, thou man of truth, answer!  Was it the fall of the trap- door that I heard?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was,&quot; said the youth.</p>
<p>&quot;It was!&quot; said the Prince; &quot;and how didst thou come to know there was  a trap-door here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw the plate of brass by a gleam of moonshine,&quot; replied he.</p>
<p>&quot;But what told thee it was a lock?&quot; said Manfred.  &quot;How didst thou  discover the secret of opening it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Providence, that delivered me from the helmet, was able to direct me  to the spring of a lock,&quot; said he.</p>
<p>&quot;Providence should have gone a little farther, and have placed thee  out of the reach of my resentment,&quot; said Manfred.  &quot;When Providence  had taught thee to open the lock, it abandoned thee for a fool, who  did not know how to make use of its favours.  Why didst thou not  pursue the path pointed out for thy escape?  Why didst thou shut the  trap-door before thou hadst descended the steps?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I might ask you, my Lord,&quot; said the peasant, &quot;how I, totally  unacquainted with your castle, was to know that those steps led to any  outlet? but I scorn to evade your questions.  Wherever those steps  lead to, perhaps I should have explored the way - I could not be in a  worse situation than I was.  But the truth is, I let the trap-door  fall:  your immediate arrival followed.  I had given the alarm - what  imported it to me whether I was seized a minute sooner or a minute  later?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art a resolute villain for thy years,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;yet on  reflection I suspect thou dost but trifle with me.  Thou hast not yet  told me how thou didst open the lock.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I will show you, my Lord,&quot; said the peasant; and, taking up a  fragment of stone that had fallen from above, he laid himself on the  trap-door, and began to beat on the piece of brass that covered it,  meaning to gain time for the escape of the Princess.  This presence of  mind, joined to the frankness of the youth, staggered Manfred.  He  even felt a disposition towards pardoning one who had been guilty of  no crime.  Manfred was not one of those savage tyrants who wanton in  cruelty unprovoked.  The circumstances of his fortune had given an  asperity to his temper, which was naturally humane; and his virtues  were always ready to operate, when his passions did not obscure his  reason.</p>
<p>While the Prince was in this suspense, a confused noise of voices  echoed through the distant vaults.  As the sound approached, he  distinguished the clamours of some of his domestics, whom he had  dispersed through the castle in search of Isabella, calling out -</p>
<p>&quot;Where is my Lord? where is the Prince?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here I am,&quot; said Manfred, as they came nearer; &quot;have you found the  Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>The first that arrived, replied, &quot;Oh, my Lord!  I am glad we have  found you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Found me!&quot; said Manfred; &quot;have you found the Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We thought we had, my Lord,&quot; said the fellow, looking terrified, &quot;but  - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, what?&quot; cried the Prince; &quot;has she escaped?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jaquez and I, my Lord - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I and Diego,&quot; interrupted the second, who came up in still  greater consternation.</p>
<p>&quot;Speak one of you at a time,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;I ask you, where is the  Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We do not know,&quot; said they both together; &quot;but we are frightened out  of our wits.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I think, blockheads,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;what is it has scared you  thus?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! my Lord,&quot; said Jaquez, &quot;Diego has seen such a sight! your  Highness would not believe our eyes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What new absurdity is this?&quot; cried Manfred; &quot;give me a direct answer,  or, by Heaven - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my Lord, if it please your Highness to hear me,&quot; said the poor  fellow, &quot;Diego and I - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I and Jaquez - &quot; cried his comrade.</p>
<p>&quot;Did not I forbid you to speak both at a time?&quot; said the Prince:   &quot;you, Jaquez, answer; for the other fool seems more distracted than  thou art; what is the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My gracious Lord,&quot; said Jaquez, &quot;if it please your Highness to hear  me; Diego and I, according to your Highness&#x27;s orders, went to search  for the young Lady; but being comprehensive that we might meet the  ghost of my young Lord, your Highness&#x27;s son, God rest his soul, as he  has not received Christian burial - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sot!&quot; cried Manfred in a rage; &quot;is it only a ghost, then, that thou  hast seen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! worse! worse! my Lord,&quot; cried Diego:  &quot;I had rather have seen ten  whole ghosts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grant me patience!&quot; said Manfred; &quot;these blockheads distract me.  Out  of my sight, Diego! and thou, Jaquez, tell me in one word, art thou  sober? art thou raving? thou wast wont to have some sense:  has the  other sot frightened himself and thee too?  Speak; what is it he  fancies he has seen?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, my Lord,&quot; replied Jaquez, trembling, &quot;I was going to tell your  Highness, that since the calamitous misfortune of my young Lord, God  rest his precious soul! not one of us your Highness&#x27;s faithful  servants - indeed we are, my Lord, though poor men - I say, not one of  us has dared to set a foot about the castle, but two together:  so  Diego and I, thinking that my young Lady might be in the great  gallery, went up there to look for her, and tell her your Highness  wanted something to impart to her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O blundering fools!&quot; cried Manfred; &quot;and in the meantime, she has  made her escape, because you were afraid of goblins! - Why, thou  knave! she left me in the gallery; I came from thence myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For all that, she may be there still for aught I know,&quot; said Jaquez;  &quot;but the devil shall have me before I seek her there again - poor  Diego!  I do not believe he will ever recover it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Recover what?&quot; said Manfred; &quot;am I never to learn what it is has  terrified these rascals? - but I lose my time; follow me, slave; I  will see if she is in the gallery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For Heaven&#x27;s sake, my dear, good Lord,&quot; cried Jaquez, &quot;do not go to  the gallery.  Satan himself I believe is in the chamber next to the  gallery.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, who hitherto had treated the terror of his servants as an  idle panic, was struck at this new circumstance.  He recollected the  apparition of the portrait, and the sudden closing of the door at the  end of the gallery.  His voice faltered, and he asked with disorder -</p>
<p>&quot;What is in the great chamber?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; said Jaquez, &quot;when Diego and I came into the gallery, he  went first, for he said he had more courage than I.  So when we came  into the gallery we found nobody.  We looked under every bench and  stool; and still we found nobody.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were all the pictures in their places?&quot; said Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my Lord,&quot; answered Jaquez; &quot;but we did not think of looking  behind them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, well!&quot; said Manfred; &quot;proceed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When we came to the door of the great chamber,&quot; continued Jaquez, &quot;we  found it shut.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And could not you open it?&quot; said Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! yes, my Lord; would to Heaven we had not!&quot; replied he - &quot;nay, it  was not I neither; it was Diego:  he was grown foolhardy, and would go  on, though I advised him not - if ever I open a door that is shut  again - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trifle not,&quot; said Manfred, shuddering, &quot;but tell me what you saw in  the great chamber on opening the door.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I! my Lord!&quot; said Jaquez; &quot;I was behind Diego; but I heard the  noise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jaquez,&quot; said Manfred, in a solemn tone of voice; &quot;tell me, I adjure  thee by the souls of my ancestors, what was it thou sawest? what was  it thou heardest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was Diego saw it, my Lord, it was not I,&quot; replied Jaquez; &quot;I only  heard the noise.  Diego had no sooner opened the door, than he cried  out, and ran back.  I ran back too, and said, &#x27;Is it the ghost?&#x27;  &#x27;The  ghost! no, no,&#x27; said Diego, and his hair stood on end - &#x27;it is a  giant, I believe; he is all clad in armour, for I saw his foot and  part of his leg, and they are as large as the helmet below in the  court.&#x27;  As he said these words, my Lord, we heard a violent motion  and the rattling of armour, as if the giant was rising, for Diego has  told me since that he believes the giant was lying down, for the foot  and leg were stretched at length on the floor.  Before we could get to  the end of the gallery, we heard the door of the great chamber clap  behind us, but we did not dare turn back to see if the giant was  following us - yet, now I think on it, we must have heard him if he  had pursued us - but for Heaven&#x27;s sake, good my Lord, send for the  chaplain, and have the castle exorcised, for, for certain, it is  enchanted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ay, pray do, my Lord,&quot; cried all the servants at once, &quot;or we must  leave your Highness&#x27;s service.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Peace, dotards!&quot; said Manfred, &quot;and follow me; I will know what all  this means.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We! my Lord!&quot; cried they with one voice; &quot;we would not go up to the  gallery for your Highness&#x27;s revenue.&quot;  The young peasant, who had  stood silent, now spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Will your Highness,&quot; said he, &quot;permit me to try this adventure?  My  life is of consequence to nobody; I fear no bad angel, and have  offended no good one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your behaviour is above your seeming,&quot; said Manfred, viewing him with  surprise and admiration - &quot;hereafter I will reward your bravery - but  now,&quot; continued he with a sigh, &quot;I am so circumstanced, that I dare  trust no eyes but my own.  However, I give you leave to accompany me.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, when he first followed Isabella from the gallery, had gone  directly to the apartment of his wife, concluding the Princess had  retired thither.  Hippolita, who knew his step, rose with anxious  fondness to meet her Lord, whom she had not seen since the death of  their son.  She would have flown in a transport mixed of joy and grief  to his bosom, but he pushed her rudely off, and said -</p>
<p>&quot;Where is Isabella?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isabella! my Lord!&quot; said the astonished Hippolita.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Isabella,&quot; cried Manfred imperiously; &quot;I want Isabella.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; replied Matilda, who perceived how much his behaviour had  shocked her mother, &quot;she has not been with us since your Highness  summoned her to your apartment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me where she is,&quot; said the Prince; &quot;I do not want to know where  she has been.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My good Lord,&quot; says Hippolita, &quot;your daughter tells you the truth:   Isabella left us by your command, and has not returned since; - but,  my good Lord, compose yourself:  retire to your rest:  this dismal day  has disordered you.  Isabella shall wait your orders in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, then, you know where she is!&quot; cried Manfred.  &quot;Tell me  directly, for I will not lose an instant - and you, woman,&quot; speaking  to his wife, &quot;order your chaplain to attend me forthwith.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isabella,&quot; said Hippolita calmly, &quot;is retired, I suppose, to her  chamber:  she is not accustomed to watch at this late hour.  Gracious  my Lord,&quot; continued she, &quot;let me know what has disturbed you.  Has  Isabella offended you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Trouble me not with questions,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;but tell me where she  is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Matilda shall call her,&quot; said the Princess.  &quot;Sit down, my Lord, and  resume your wonted fortitude.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, art thou jealous of Isabella?&quot; replied he, &quot;that you wish to be  present at our interview!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good heavens! my Lord,&quot; said Hippolita, &quot;what is it your Highness  means?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou wilt know ere many minutes are passed,&quot; said the cruel Prince.   &quot;Send your chaplain to me, and wait my pleasure here.&quot;</p>
<p>At these words he flung out of the room in search of Isabella, leaving  the amazed ladies thunderstruck with his words and frantic deportment,  and lost in vain conjectures on what he was meditating.</p>
<p>Manfred was now returning from the vault, attended by the peasant and  a few of his servants whom he had obliged to accompany him.  He  ascended the staircase without stopping till he arrived at the  gallery, at the door of which he met Hippolita and her chaplain.  When  Diego had been dismissed by Manfred, he had gone directly to the  Princess&#x27;s apartment with the alarm of what he had seen.  That  excellent Lady, who no more than Manfred doubted of the reality of the  vision, yet affected to treat it as a delirium of the servant.   Willing, however, to save her Lord from any additional shock, and  prepared by a series of griefs not to tremble at any accession to it,  she determined to make herself the first sacrifice, if fate had marked  the present hour for their destruction.  Dismissing the reluctant  Matilda to her rest, who in vain sued for leave to accompany her  mother, and attended only by her chaplain, Hippolita had visited the  gallery and great chamber; and now with more serenity of soul than she  had felt for many hours, she met her Lord, and assured him that the  vision of the gigantic leg and foot was all a fable; and no doubt an  impression made by fear, and the dark and dismal hour of the night, on  the minds of his servants.  She and the chaplain had examined the  chamber, and found everything in the usual order.</p>
<p>Manfred, though persuaded, like his wife, that the vision had been no  work of fancy, recovered a little from the tempest of mind into which  so many strange events had thrown him.  Ashamed, too, of his inhuman  treatment of a Princess who returned every injury with new marks of  tenderness and duty, he felt returning love forcing itself into his  eyes; but not less ashamed of feeling remorse towards one against whom  he was inwardly meditating a yet more bitter outrage, he curbed the  yearnings of his heart, and did not dare to lean even towards pity.   The next transition of his soul was to exquisite villainy.</p>
<p>Presuming on the unshaken submission of Hippolita, he flattered  himself that she would not only acquiesce with patience to a divorce,  but would obey, if it was his pleasure, in endeavouring to persuade  Isabella to give him her hand - but ere he could indulge his horrid  hope, he reflected that Isabella was not to be found.  Coming to  himself, he gave orders that every avenue to the castle should be  strictly guarded, and charged his domestics on pain of their lives to  suffer nobody to pass out.  The young peasant, to whom he spoke  favourably, he ordered to remain in a small chamber on the stairs, in  which there was a pallet-bed, and the key of which he took away  himself, telling the youth he would talk with him in the morning.   Then dismissing his attendants, and bestowing a sullen kind of half- nod on Hippolita, he retired to his own chamber.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<p>MATILDA, who by Hippolita&#x27;s order had retired to her apartment, was  ill-disposed to take any rest.  The shocking fate of her brother had  deeply affected her.  She was surprised at not seeing Isabella; but  the strange words which had fallen from her father, and his obscure  menace to the Princess his wife, accompanied by the most furious  behaviour, had filled her gentle mind with terror and alarm.  She  waited anxiously for the return of Bianca, a young damsel that  attended her, whom she had sent to learn what was become of Isabella.   Bianca soon appeared, and informed her mistress of what she had  gathered from the servants, that Isabella was nowhere to be found.   She related the adventure of the young peasant who had been discovered  in the vault, though with many simple additions from the incoherent  accounts of the domestics; and she dwelt principally on the gigantic  leg and foot which had been seen in the gallery-chamber.  This last  circumstance had terrified Bianca so much, that she was rejoiced when  Matilda told her that she would not go to rest, but would watch till  the Princess should rise.</p>
<p>The young Princess wearied herself in conjectures on the flight of  Isabella, and on the threats of Manfred to her mother.  &quot;But what  business could he have so urgent with the chaplain?&quot; said Matilda,  &quot;Does he intend to have my brother&#x27;s body interred privately in the  chapel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Madam!&quot; said Bianca, &quot;now I guess.  As you are become his  heiress, he is impatient to have you married:  he has always been  raving for more sons; I warrant he is now impatient for grandsons.  As  sure as I live, Madam, I shall see you a bride at last. - Good madam,  you won&#x27;t cast off your faithful Bianca:  you won&#x27;t put Donna Rosara  over me now you are a great Princess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My poor Bianca,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;how fast your thoughts amble!  I a  great princess!  What hast thou seen in Manfred&#x27;s behaviour since my  brother&#x27;s death that bespeaks any increase of tenderness to me?  No,  Bianca; his heart was ever a stranger to me - but he is my father, and  I must not complain.  Nay, if Heaven shuts my father&#x27;s heart against  me, it overpays my little merit in the tenderness of my mother - O  that dear mother! yes, Bianca, &#x27;tis there I feel the rugged temper of  Manfred.  I can support his harshness to me with patience; but it  wounds my soul when I am witness to his causeless severity towards  her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Madam,&quot; said Bianca, &quot;all men use their wives so, when they are  weary of them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet you congratulated me but now,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;when you  fancied my father intended to dispose of me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would have you a great Lady,&quot; replied Bianca, &quot;come what will.  I  do not wish to see you moped in a convent, as you would be if you had  your will, and if my Lady, your mother, who knows that a bad husband  is better than no husband at all, did not hinder you. - Bless me! what  noise is that!  St. Nicholas forgive me!  I was but in jest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is the wind,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;whistling through the battlements in  the tower above:  you have heard it a thousand times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nay,&quot; said Bianca, &quot;there was no harm neither in what I said:  it is  no sin to talk of matrimony - and so, Madam, as I was saying, if my  Lord Manfred should offer you a handsome young Prince for a  bridegroom, you would drop him a curtsey, and tell him you would  rather take the veil?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank Heaven!  I am in no such danger,&quot; said Matilda:  &quot;you know how  many proposals for me he has rejected - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you thank him, like a dutiful daughter, do you, Madam?  But come,  Madam; suppose, to-morrow morning, he was to send for you to the great  council chamber, and there you should find at his elbow a lovely young  Prince, with large black eyes, a smooth white forehead, and manly  curling locks like jet; in short, Madam, a young hero resembling the  picture of the good Alfonso in the gallery, which you sit and gaze at  for hours together - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do not speak lightly of that picture,&quot; interrupted Matilda sighing;  &quot;I know the adoration with which I look at that picture is uncommon -  but I am not in love with a coloured panel.  The character of that  virtuous Prince, the veneration with which my mother has inspired me  for his memory, the orisons which, I know not why, she has enjoined me  to pour forth at his tomb, all have concurred to persuade me that  somehow or other my destiny is linked with something relating to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord, Madam! how should that be?&quot; said Bianca; &quot;I have always heard  that your family was in no way related to his:  and I am sure I cannot  conceive why my Lady, the Princess, sends you in a cold morning or a  damp evening to pray at his tomb:  he is no saint by the almanack.  If  you must pray, why does she not bid you address yourself to our great  St. Nicholas?  I am sure he is the saint I pray to for a husband.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps my mind would be less affected,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;if my mother  would explain her reasons to me:  but it is the mystery she observes,  that inspires me with this - I know not what to call it.  As she never  acts from caprice, I am sure there is some fatal secret at bottom -  nay, I know there is:  in her agony of grief for my brother&#x27;s death  she dropped some words that intimated as much.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! dear Madam,&quot; cried Bianca, &quot;what were they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;if a parent lets fall a word, and wishes it  recalled, it is not for a child to utter it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What! was she sorry for what she had said?&quot; asked Bianca; &quot;I am sure,  Madam, you may trust me - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With my own little secrets when I have any, I may,&quot; said Matilda;  &quot;but never with my mother&#x27;s:  a child ought to have no ears or eyes  but as a parent directs.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well! to be sure, Madam, you were born to be a saint,&quot; said Bianca,  &quot;and there is no resisting one&#x27;s vocation:  you will end in a convent  at last.  But there is my Lady Isabella would not be so reserved to  me:  she will let me talk to her of young men:  and when a handsome  cavalier has come to the castle, she has owned to me that she wished  your brother Conrad resembled him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bianca,&quot; said the Princess, &quot;I do not allow you to mention my friend  disrespectfully.  Isabella is of a cheerful disposition, but her soul  is pure as virtue itself.  She knows your idle babbling humour, and  perhaps has now and then encouraged it, to divert melancholy, and  enliven the solitude in which my father keeps us - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blessed Mary!&quot; said Bianca, starting, &quot;there it is again!  Dear  Madam, do you hear nothing? this castle is certainly haunted!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Peace!&quot; said Matilda, &quot;and listen!  I did think I heard a voice - but  it must be fancy:  your terrors, I suppose, have infected me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed! indeed!  Madam,&quot; said Bianca, half-weeping with agony, &quot;I am  sure I heard a voice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does anybody lie in the chamber beneath?&quot; said the Princess.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody has dared to lie there,&quot; answered Bianca, &quot;since the great  astrologer, that was your brother&#x27;s tutor, drowned himself.  For  certain, Madam, his ghost and the young Prince&#x27;s are now met in the  chamber below - for Heaven&#x27;s sake let us fly to your mother&#x27;s  apartment!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I charge you not to stir,&quot; said Matilda.  &quot;If they are spirits in  pain, we may ease their sufferings by questioning them.  They can mean  no hurt to us, for we have not injured them - and if they should,  shall we be more safe in one chamber than in another?  Reach me my  beads; we will say a prayer, and then speak to them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! dear Lady, I would not speak to a ghost for the world!&quot; cried  Bianca.  As she said those words they heard the casement of the little  chamber below Matilda&#x27;s open.  They listened attentively, and in a few  minutes thought they heard a person sing, but could not distinguish  the words.</p>
<p>&quot;This can be no evil spirit,&quot; said the Princess, in a low voice; &quot;it  is undoubtedly one of the family - open the window, and we shall know  the voice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dare not, indeed, Madam,&quot; said Bianca.</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art a very fool,&quot; said Matilda, opening the window gently  herself.  The noise the Princess made was, however, heard by the  person beneath, who stopped; and they concluded had heard the casement  open.</p>
<p>&quot;Is anybody below?&quot; said the Princess; &quot;if there is, speak.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said an unknown voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it?&quot; said Matilda.</p>
<p>&quot;A stranger,&quot; replied the voice.</p>
<p>&quot;What stranger?&quot; said she; &quot;and how didst thou come there at this  unusual hour, when all the gates of the castle are locked?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not here willingly,&quot; answered the voice.  &quot;But pardon me, Lady,  if I have disturbed your rest; I knew not that I was overheard.  Sleep  had forsaken me; I left a restless couch, and came to waste the  irksome hours with gazing on the fair approach of morning, impatient  to be dismissed from this castle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thy words and accents,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;are of melancholy cast; if  thou art unhappy, I pity thee.  If poverty afflicts thee, let me know  it; I will mention thee to the Princess, whose beneficent soul ever  melts for the distressed, and she will relieve thee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am indeed unhappy,&quot; said the stranger; &quot;and I know not what wealth  is.  But I do not complain of the lot which Heaven has cast for me; I  am young and healthy, and am not ashamed of owing my support to myself  - yet think me not proud, or that I disdain your generous offers.  I  will remember you in my orisons, and will pray for blessings on your  gracious self and your noble mistress - if I sigh, Lady, it is for  others, not for myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now I have it, Madam,&quot; said Bianca, whispering the Princess; &quot;this is  certainly the young peasant; and, by my conscience, he is in love -  Well! this is a charming adventure! - do, Madam, let us sift him.  He  does not know you, but takes you for one of my Lady Hippolita&#x27;s  women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Art thou not ashamed, Bianca!&quot; said the Princess.   &quot;What right have  we to pry into the secrets of this young man&#x27;s heart?  He seems  virtuous and frank, and tells us he is unhappy.  Are those  circumstances that authorise us to make a property of him?  How are we  entitled to his confidence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord, Madam! how little you know of love!&quot; replied Bianca; &quot;why,  lovers have no pleasure equal to talking of their mistress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And would you have ME become a peasant&#x27;s confidante?&quot; said the  Princess.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, let me talk to him,&quot; said Bianca; &quot;though I have the  honour of being your Highness&#x27;s maid of honour, I was not always so  great.  Besides, if love levels ranks, it raises them too; I have a  respect for any young man in love.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Peace, simpleton!&quot; said the Princess.  &quot;Though he said he was  unhappy, it does not follow that he must be in love.  Think of all  that has happened to-day, and tell me if there are no misfortunes but  what love causes. - Stranger,&quot; resumed the Princess, &quot;if thy  misfortunes have not been occasioned by thy own fault, and are within  the compass of the Princess Hippolita&#x27;s power to redress, I will take  upon me to answer that she will be thy protectress.  When thou art  dismissed from this castle, repair to holy father Jerome, at the  convent adjoining to the church of St. Nicholas, and make thy story  known to him, as far as thou thinkest meet.  He will not fail to  inform the Princess, who is the mother of all that want her  assistance.  Farewell; it is not seemly for me to hold farther  converse with a man at this unwonted hour.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May the saints guard thee, gracious Lady!&quot; replied the peasant; &quot;but  oh! if a poor and worthless stranger might presume to beg a minute&#x27;s  audience farther; am I so happy? the casement is not shut; might I  venture to ask - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speak quickly,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;the morning dawns apace:  should the  labourers come into the fields and perceive us - What wouldst thou  ask?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know not how, I know not if I dare,&quot; said the Young stranger,  faltering; &quot;yet the humanity with which you have spoken to me  emboldens - Lady! dare I trust you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heavens!&quot; said Matilda, &quot;what dost thou mean?  With what wouldst thou  trust me?  Speak boldly, if thy secret is fit to be entrusted to a  virtuous breast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would ask,&quot; said the peasant, recollecting himself, &quot;whether what I  have heard from the domestics is true, that the Princess is missing  from the castle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What imports it to thee to know?&quot; replied Matilda.  &quot;Thy first words  bespoke a prudent and becoming gravity.  Dost thou come hither to pry  into the secrets of Manfred?  Adieu.  I have been mistaken in thee.&quot;   Saying these words she shut the casement hastily, without giving the  young man time to reply.</p>
<p>&quot;I had acted more wisely,&quot; said the Princess to Bianca, with some  sharpness, &quot;if I had let thee converse with this peasant; his  inquisitiveness seems of a piece with thy own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is not fit for me to argue with your Highness,&quot; replied Bianca;  &quot;but perhaps the questions I should have put to him would have been  more to the purpose than those you have been pleased to ask him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! no doubt,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;you are a very discreet personage!  May  I know what YOU would have asked him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A bystander often sees more of the game than those that play,&quot;  answered Bianca.  &quot;Does your Highness think, Madam, that this question  about my Lady Isabella was the result of mere curiosity?  No, no,  Madam, there is more in it than you great folks are aware of.  Lopez  told me that all the servants believe this young fellow contrived my  Lady Isabella&#x27;s escape; now, pray, Madam, observe you and I both know  that my Lady Isabella never much fancied the Prince your brother.   Well! he is killed just in a critical minute - I accuse nobody.  A  helmet falls from the moon - so, my Lord, your father says; but Lopez  and all the servants say that this young spark is a magician, and  stole it from Alfonso&#x27;s tomb - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have done with this rhapsody of impertinence,&quot; said Matilda.</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, Madam, as you please,&quot; cried Bianca; &quot;yet it is very particular  though, that my Lady Isabella should be missing the very same day, and  that this young sorcerer should be found at the mouth of the trap- door.  I accuse nobody; but if my young Lord came honestly by his  death - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dare not on thy duty,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;to breathe a suspicion on the  purity of my dear Isabella&#x27;s fame.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Purity, or not purity,&quot; said Bianca, &quot;gone she is - a stranger is  found that nobody knows; you question him yourself; he tells you he is  in love, or unhappy, it is the same thing - nay, he owned he was  unhappy about others; and is anybody unhappy about another, unless  they are in love with them? and at the very next word, he asks  innocently, pour soul! if my Lady Isabella is missing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;thy observations are not totally without  foundation - Isabella&#x27;s flight amazes me.  The curiosity of the  stranger is very particular; yet Isabella never concealed a thought  from me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So she told you,&quot; said Bianca, &quot;to fish out your secrets; but who  knows, Madam, but this stranger may be some Prince in disguise?  Do,  Madam, let me open the window, and ask him a few questions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Matilda, &quot;I will ask him myself, if he knows aught of  Isabella; he is not worthy I should converse farther with him.&quot;  She  was going to open the casement, when they heard the bell ring at the  postern-gate of the castle, which is on the right hand of the tower,  where Matilda lay.  This prevented the Princess from renewing the  conversation with the stranger.</p>
<p>After continuing silent for some time, &quot;I am persuaded,&quot; said she to  Bianca, &quot;that whatever be the cause of Isabella&#x27;s flight it had no  unworthy motive.  If this stranger was accessory to it, she must be  satisfied with his fidelity and worth.  I observed, did not you,  Bianca? that his words were tinctured with an uncommon infusion of  piety.  It was no ruffian&#x27;s speech; his phrases were becoming a man of  gentle birth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told you, Madam,&quot; said Bianca, &quot;that I was sure he was some Prince  in disguise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yet,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;if he was privy to her escape, how will you  account for his not accompanying her in her flight? why expose himself  unnecessarily and rashly to my father&#x27;s resentment?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for that, Madam,&quot; replied she, &quot;if he could get from under the  helmet, he will find ways of eluding your father&#x27;s anger.  I do not  doubt but he has some talisman or other about him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You resolve everything into magic,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;but a man who has  any intercourse with infernal spirits, does not dare to make use of  those tremendous and holy words which he uttered.  Didst thou not  observe with what fervour he vowed to remember ME to heaven in his  prayers?  Yes; Isabella was undoubtedly convinced of his piety.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Commend me to the piety of a young fellow and a damsel that consult  to elope!&quot; said Bianca.  &quot;No, no, Madam, my Lady Isabella is of  another guess mould than you take her for.  She used indeed to sigh  and lift up her eyes in your company, because she knows you are a  saint; but when your back was turned - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You wrong her,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;Isabella is no hypocrite; she has a  due sense of devotion, but never affected a call she has not.  On the  contrary, she always combated my inclination for the cloister; and  though I own the mystery she has made to me of her flight confounds  me; though it seems inconsistent with the friendship between us; I  cannot forget the disinterested warmth with which she always opposed  my taking the veil.  She wished to see me married, though my dower  would have been a loss to her and my brother&#x27;s children.  For her sake  I will believe well of this young peasant.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you do think there is some liking between them,&quot; said Bianca.   While she was speaking, a servant came hastily into the chamber and  told the Princess that the Lady Isabella was found.</p>
<p>&quot;Where?&quot; said Matilda.</p>
<p>&quot;She has taken sanctuary in St. Nicholas&#x27;s church,&quot; replied the  servant; &quot;Father Jerome has brought the news himself; he is below with  his Highness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where is my mother?&quot; said Matilda.</p>
<p>&quot;She is in her own chamber, Madam, and has asked for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred had risen at the first dawn of light, and gone to Hippolita&#x27;s  apartment, to inquire if she knew aught of Isabella.  While he was  questioning her, word was brought that Jerome demanded to speak with  him.  Manfred, little suspecting the cause of the Friar&#x27;s arrival, and  knowing he was employed by Hippolita in her charities, ordered him to  be admitted, intending to leave them together, while he pursued his  search after Isabella.</p>
<p>&quot;Is your business with me or the Princess?&quot; said Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;With both,&quot; replied the holy man.  &quot;The Lady Isabella - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What of her?&quot; interrupted Manfred, eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;Is at St. Nicholas&#x27;s altar,&quot; replied Jerome.</p>
<p>&quot;That is no business of Hippolita,&quot; said Manfred with confusion; &quot;let  us retire to my chamber, Father, and inform me how she came thither.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, my Lord,&quot; replied the good man, with an air of firmness and  authority, that daunted even the resolute Manfred, who could not help  revering the saint-like virtues of Jerome; &quot;my commission is to both,  and with your Highness&#x27;s good-liking, in the presence of both I shall  deliver it; but first, my Lord, I must interrogate the Princess,  whether she is acquainted with the cause of the Lady Isabella&#x27;s  retirement from your castle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, on my soul,&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;does Isabella charge me with being  privy to it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Father,&quot;  interrupted Manfred, &quot;I pay due reverence to your holy  profession; but I am sovereign here, and will allow no meddling priest  to interfere in the affairs of my domestic.  If you have aught to say  attend me to my chamber; I do not use to let my wife be acquainted  with the secret affairs of my state; they are not within a woman&#x27;s  province.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; said the holy man, &quot;I am no intruder into the secrets of  families.  My office is to promote peace, to heal divisions, to preach  repentance, and teach mankind to curb their headstrong passions.  I  forgive your Highness&#x27;s uncharitable apostrophe; I know my duty, and  am the minister of a mightier prince than Manfred.  Hearken to him who  speaks through my organs.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred trembled with rage and shame.  Hippolita&#x27;s countenance  declared her astonishment and impatience to know where this would end.   Her silence more strongly spoke her observance of Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lady Isabella,&quot; resumed Jerome, &quot;commends herself to both your  Highnesses; she thanks both for the kindness with which she has been  treated in your castle:  she deplores the loss of your son, and her  own misfortune in not becoming the daughter of such wise and noble  Princes, whom she shall always respect as Parents; she prays for  uninterrupted union and felicity between you&quot; [Manfred&#x27;s colour  changed]:  &quot;but as it is no longer possible for her to be allied to  you, she entreats your consent to remain in sanctuary, till she can  learn news of her father, or, by the certainty of his death, be at  liberty, with the approbation of her guardians, to dispose of herself  in suitable marriage.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall give no such consent,&quot; said the Prince, &quot;but insist on her  return to the castle without delay:  I am answerable for her person to  her guardians, and will not brook her being in any hands but my own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your Highness will recollect whether that can any longer be proper,&quot;  replied the Friar.</p>
<p>&quot;I want no monitor,&quot; said Manfred, colouring; &quot;Isabella&#x27;s conduct  leaves room for strange suspicions - and that young villain, who was  at least the accomplice of her flight, if not the cause of it - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The cause!&quot; interrupted Jerome; &quot;was a YOUNG man the cause?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is not to be borne!&quot; cried Manfred.  &quot;Am I to be bearded in my  own palace by an insolent Monk?  Thou art privy, I guess, to their  amours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would pray to heaven to clear up your uncharitable surmises,&quot; said  Jerome, &quot;if your Highness were not satisfied in your conscience how  unjustly you accuse me.  I do pray to heaven to pardon that  uncharitableness:  and I implore your Highness to leave the Princess  at peace in that holy place, where she is not liable to be disturbed  by such vain and worldly fantasies as discourses of love from any  man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cant not to me,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;but return and bring the Princess to  her duty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is my duty to prevent her return hither,&quot; said Jerome.  &quot;She is  where orphans and virgins are safest from the snares and wiles of this  world; and nothing but a parent&#x27;s authority shall take her thence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am her parent,&quot; cried Manfred, &quot;and demand her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She wished to have you for her parent,&quot; said the Friar; &quot;but Heaven  that forbad that connection has for ever dissolved all ties betwixt  you:  and I announce to your Highness - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop! audacious man,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;and dread my displeasure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Holy farther,&quot; said Hippolita, &quot;it is your office to be no respecter  of persons:  you must speak as your duty prescribes:  but it is my  duty to hear nothing that it pleases not my Lord I should hear.   Attend the Prince to his chamber.  I will retire to my oratory, and  pray to the blessed Virgin to inspire you with her holy counsels, and  to restore the heart of my gracious Lord to its wonted peace and  gentleness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excellent woman!&quot; said the Friar.  &quot;My Lord, I attend your pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, accompanied by the Friar, passed to his own apartment, where  shutting the door, &quot;I perceive, Father,&quot; said he, &quot;that Isabella has  acquainted you with my purpose.  Now hear my resolve, and obey.   Reasons of state, most urgent reasons, my own and the safety of my  people, demand that I should have a son.  It is in vain to expect an  heir from Hippolita.  I have made choice of Isabella.  You must bring  her back; and you must do more.  I know the influence you have with  Hippolita:  her conscience is in your hands.  She is, I allow, a  faultless woman:  her soul is set on heaven, and scorns the little  grandeur of this world:  you can withdraw her from it entirely.   Persuade her to consent to the dissolution of our marriage, and to  retire into a monastery - she shall endow one if she will; and she  shall have the means of being as liberal to your order as she or you  can wish.  Thus you will divert the calamities that are hanging over  our heads, and have the merit of saying the principality of Otranto  from destruction.  You are a prudent man, and though the warmth of my  temper betrayed me into some unbecoming expressions, I honour your  virtue, and wish to be indebted to you for the repose of my life and  the preservation of my family.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The will of heaven be done!&quot; said the Friar.  &quot;I am but its worthless  instrument.  It makes use of my tongue to tell thee, Prince, of thy  unwarrantable designs.  The injuries of the virtuous Hippolita have  mounted to the throne of pity.  By me thou art reprimanded for thy  adulterous intention of repudiating her:  by me thou art warned not to  pursue the incestuous design on thy contracted daughter.  Heaven that  delivered her from thy fury, when the judgments so recently fallen on  thy house ought to have inspired thee with other thoughts, will  continue to watch over her.  Even I, a poor and despised Friar, am  able to protect her from thy violence - I, sinner as I am, and  uncharitably reviled by your Highness as an accomplice of I know not  what amours, scorn the allurements with which it has pleased thee to  tempt mine honesty.  I love my order; I honour devout souls; I respect  the piety of thy Princess - but I will not betray the confidence she  reposes in me, nor serve even the cause of religion by foul and sinful  compliances - but forsooth! the welfare of the state depends on your  Highness having a son!  Heaven mocks the short-sighted views of man.   But yester-morn, whose house was so great, so flourishing as  Manfred&#x27;s? - where is young Conrad now? - My Lord, I respect your  tears - but I mean not to check them - let them flow, Prince!  They  will weigh more with heaven toward the welfare of thy subjects, than a  marriage, which, founded on lust or policy, could never prosper.  The  sceptre, which passed from the race of Alfonso to thine, cannot be  preserved by a match which the church will never allow.  If it is the  will of the Most High that Manfred&#x27;s name must perish, resign  yourself, my Lord, to its decrees; and thus deserve a crown that can  never pass away.  Come, my Lord; I like this sorrow - let us return to  the Princess:  she is not apprised of your cruel intentions; nor did I  mean more than to alarm you.  You saw with what gentle patience, with  what efforts of love, she heard, she rejected hearing, the extent of  your guilt.  I know she longs to fold you in her arms, and assure you  of her unalterable affection.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Father,&quot; said the Prince, &quot;you mistake my compunction:  true, I  honour Hippolita&#x27;s virtues; I think her a Saint; and wish it were for  my soul&#x27;s health to tie faster the knot that has united us - but alas!  Father, you know not the bitterest of my pangs! it is some time that I  have had scruples on the legality of our union:  Hippolita is related  to me in the fourth degree - it is true, we had a dispensation:  but I  have been informed that she had also been contracted to another.  This  it is that sits heavy at my heart:  to this state of unlawful wedlock  I impute the visitation that has fallen on me in the death of Conrad!  - ease my conscience of this burden:  dissolve our marriage, and  accomplish the work of godliness - which your divine exhortations have  commenced in my soul.&quot;</p>
<p>How cutting was the anguish which the good man felt, when he perceived  this turn in the wily Prince!  He trembled for Hippolita, whose ruin  he saw was determined; and he feared if Manfred had no hope of  recovering Isabella, that his impatience for a son would direct him to  some other object, who might not be equally proof against the  temptation of Manfred&#x27;s rank.  For some time the holy man remained  absorbed in thought.  At length, conceiving some hopes from delay, he  thought the wisest conduct would be to prevent the Prince from  despairing of recovering Isabella.  Her the Friar knew he could  dispose, from her affection to Hippolita, and from the aversion she  had expressed to him for Manfred&#x27;s addresses, to second his views,  till the censures of the church could be fulminated against a divorce.   With this intention, as if struck with the Prince&#x27;s scruples, he at  length said:</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord, I have been pondering on what your Highness has said; and if  in truth it is delicacy of conscience that is the real motive of your  repugnance to your virtuous Lady, far be it from me to endeavour to  harden your heart.  The church is an indulgent mother:  unfold your  griefs to her:  she alone can administer comfort to your soul, either  by satisfying your conscience, or upon examination of your scruples,  by setting you at liberty, and indulging you in the lawful means of  continuing your lineage.  In the latter case, if the Lady Isabella can  be brought to consent - &quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, who concluded that he had either over-reached the good man,  or that his first warmth had been but a tribute paid to appearance,  was overjoyed at this sudden turn, and repeated the most magnificent  promises, if he should succeed by the Friar&#x27;s mediation.  The well- meaning priest suffered him to deceive himself, fully determined to  traverse his views, instead of seconding them.</p>
<p>&quot;Since we now understand one another,&quot; resumed the Prince, &quot;I expect,  Father, that you satisfy me in one point.  Who is the youth that I  found in the vault?  He must have been privy to Isabella&#x27;s flight:   tell me truly, is he her lover? or is he an agent for another&#x27;s  passion?  I have often suspected Isabella&#x27;s indifference to my son:  a  thousand circumstances crowd on my mind that confirm that suspicion.   She herself was so conscious of it, that while I discoursed her in the  gallery, she outran my suspicious, and endeavoured to justify herself  from coolness to Conrad.&quot;</p>
<p>The Friar, who knew nothing of the youth, but what he had learnt  occasionally from the Princess, ignorant what was become of him, and  not sufficiently reflecting on the impetuosity of Manfred&#x27;s temper,  conceived that it might not be amiss to sow the seeds of jealousy in  his mind:  they might be turned to some use hereafter, either by  prejudicing the Prince against Isabella, if he persisted in that union  or by diverting his attention to a wrong scent, and employing his  thoughts on a visionary intrigue, prevent his engaging in any new  pursuit.  With this unhappy policy, he answered in a manner to confirm  Manfred in the belief of some connection between Isabella and the  youth.  The Prince, whose passions wanted little fuel to throw them  into a blaze, fell into a rage at the idea of what the Friar  suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;I will fathom to the bottom of this intrigue,&quot; cried he; and  quitting Jerome abruptly, with a command to remain there till his  return, he hastened to the great hall of the castle, and ordered the  peasant to be brought before him.</p>
<p>&quot;Thou hardened young impostor!&quot; said the Prince, as soon as he saw the  youth; &quot;what becomes of thy boasted veracity now? it was Providence,  was it, and the light of the moon, that discovered the lock of the  trap-door to thee?  Tell me, audacious boy, who thou art, and how long  thou hast been acquainted with the Princess - and take care to answer  with less equivocation than thou didst last night, or tortures shall  wring the truth from thee.&quot;</p>
<p>The young man, perceiving that his share in the flight of the Princess  was discovered, and concluding that anything he should say could no  longer be of any service or detriment to her, replied -</p>
<p>&quot;I am no impostor, my Lord, nor have I deserved opprobrious language.   I answered to every question your Highness put to me last night with  the same veracity that I shall speak now:  and that will not be from  fear of your tortures, but because my soul abhors a falsehood.  Please  to repeat your questions, my Lord; I am ready to give you all the  satisfaction in my power.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know my questions,&quot; replied the Prince, &quot;and only want time to  prepare an evasion.  Speak directly; who art thou? and how long hast  thou been known to the Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am a labourer at the next village,&quot; said the peasant; &quot;my name is  Theodore.  The Princess found me in the vault last night:  before that  hour I never was in her presence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I may believe as much or as little as I please of this,&quot; said  Manfred; &quot;but I will hear thy own story before I examine into the  truth of it.  Tell me, what reason did the Princess give thee for  making her escape? thy life depends on thy answer.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She told me,&quot; replied Theodore, &quot;that she was on the brink of  destruction, and that if she could not escape from the castle, she was  in danger in a few moments of being made miserable for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And on this slight foundation, on a silly girl&#x27;s report,&quot; said  Manfred, &quot;thou didst hazard my displeasure?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I fear no man&#x27;s displeasure,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;when a woman in  distress puts herself under my protection.&quot;</p>
<p>During this examination, Matilda was going to the apartment of  Hippolita.  At the upper end of the hall, where Manfred sat, was a  boarded gallery with latticed windows, through which Matilda and  Bianca were to pass.  Hearing her father&#x27;s voice, and seeing the  servants assembled round him, she stopped to learn the occasion.  The  prisoner soon drew her attention:  the steady and composed manner in  which he answered, and the gallantry of his last reply, which were the  first words she heard distinctly, interested her in his flavour.  His  person was noble, handsome, and commanding, even in that situation:   but his countenance soon engrossed her whole care.</p>
<p>&quot;Heavens!  Bianca,&quot; said the Princess softly, &quot;do I dream? or is not  that youth the exact resemblance of Alfonso&#x27;s picture in the gallery?&quot;</p>
<p>She could say no more, for her father&#x27;s voice grew louder at every  word.</p>
<p>&quot;This bravado,&quot; said he, &quot;surpasses all thy former insolence.  Thou  shalt experience the wrath with which thou darest to trifle.  Seize  him,&quot; continued Manfred, &quot;and &#x27;bind him - the first news the Princess  hears of her champion shall be, that he has lost his head for her  sake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The injustice of which thou art guilty towards me,&quot; said Theodore,  &quot;convinces me that I have done a good deed in delivering the Princess  from thy tyranny.  May she be happy, whatever becomes of me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a lover!&quot; cried Manfred in a rage:  &quot;a peasant within sight  of death is not animated by such sentiments.  Tell me, tell me, rash  boy, who thou art, or the rack shall force thy secret from thee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou hast threatened me with death already,&quot; said the youth, &quot;for the  truth I have told thee:  if that is all the encouragement I am to  expect for sincerity, I am not tempted to indulge thy vain curiosity  farther.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then thou wilt not speak?&quot; said Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;I will not,&quot; replied he.</p>
<p>&quot;Bear him away into the courtyard,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;I will see his head  this instant severed from his body.&quot;</p>
<p>Matilda fainted at hearing those words.  Bianca shrieked, and cried -</p>
<p>&quot;Help! help! the Princess is dead!&quot;  Manfred started at this  ejaculation, and demanded what was the matter!  The young peasant, who  heard it too, was struck with horror, and asked eagerly the same  question; but Manfred ordered him to be hurried into the court, and  kept there for execution, till he had informed himself of the cause of  Bianca&#x27;s shrieks.  When he learned the meaning, he treated it as a  womanish panic, and ordering Matilda to be carried to her apartment,  he rushed into the court, and calling for one of his guards, bade  Theodore kneel down, and prepare to receive the fatal blow.</p>
<p>The undaunted youth received the bitter sentence with a resignation  that touched every heart but Manfred&#x27;s.  He wished earnestly to know  the meaning of the words he had heard relating to the Princess; but  fearing to exasperate the tyrant more against her, he desisted.  The  only boon he deigned to ask was, that he might be permitted to have a  confessor, and make his peace with heaven.  Manfred, who hoped by the  confessor&#x27;s means to come at the youth&#x27;s history, readily granted his  request; and being convinced that Father Jerome was now in his  interest, he ordered him to be called and shrive the prisoner.  The  holy man, who had little foreseen the catastrophe that his imprudence  occasioned, fell on his knees to the Prince, and adjured him in the  most solemn manner not to shed innocent blood.  He accused himself in  the bitterest terms for his indiscretion, endeavoured to disculpate  the youth, and left no method untried to soften the tyrant&#x27;s rage.   Manfred, more incensed than appeased by Jerome&#x27;s intercession, whose  retraction now made him suspect he had been imposed upon by both,  commanded the Friar to do his duty, telling him he would not allow the  prisoner many minutes for confession.</p>
<p>&quot;Nor do I ask many, my Lord,&quot; said the unhappy young man.  &quot;My sins,  thank heaven, have not been numerous; nor exceed what might be  expected at my years.  Dry your tears, good Father, and let us  despatch.  This is a bad world; nor have I had cause to leave it with  regret.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh wretched youth!&quot; said Jerome; &quot;how canst thou bear the sight of me  with patience?  I am thy murderer! it is I have brought this dismal  hour upon thee!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I forgive thee from my soul,&quot; said the youth, &quot;as I hope heaven will  pardon me.  Hear my confession, Father; and give me thy blessing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can I prepare thee for thy passage as I ought?&quot; said Jerome.   &quot;Thou canst not be saved without pardoning thy foes - and canst thou  forgive that impious man there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can,&quot; said Theodore; &quot;I do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And does not this touch thee, cruel Prince?&quot; said the Friar.</p>
<p>&quot;I sent for thee to confess him,&quot; said Manfred, sternly; &quot;not to plead  for him.  Thou didst first incense me against him - his blood be upon  thy head!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will! it will!&quot; said the good main, in an agony of sorrow.  &quot;Thou  and I must never hope to go where this blessed youth is going!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despatch!&quot; said Manfred; &quot;I am no more to be moved by the whining of  priests than by the shrieks of women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; said the youth; &quot;is it possible that my fate could have  occasioned what I heard!  Is the Princess then again in thy power?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou dost but remember me of my wrath,&quot; said Manfred.  &quot;Prepare thee,  for this moment is thy last.&quot;</p>
<p>The youth, who felt his indignation rise, and who was touched with the  sorrow which he saw he had infused into all the spectators, as well as  into the Friar, suppressed his emotions, and putting off his doublet,  and unbuttoning, his collar, knelt down to his prayers.  As he  stooped, his shirt slipped down below his shoulder, and discovered the  mark of a bloody arrow.</p>
<p>&quot;Gracious heaven!&quot; cried the holy man, starting; &quot;what do I see?  It  is my child! my Theodore!&quot;</p>
<p>The passions that ensued must be conceived; they cannot be painted.   The tears of the assistants were suspended by wonder, rather than  stopped by joy.  They seemed to inquire in the eyes of their Lord what  they ought to feel.  Surprise, doubt, tenderness, respect, succeeded  each other in the countenance of the youth.  He received with modest  submission the effusion of the old man&#x27;s tears and embraces.  Yet  afraid of giving a loose to hope, and suspecting from what had passed  the inflexibility of Manfred&#x27;s temper, he cast a glance towards the  Prince, as if to say, canst thou be unmoved at such a scene as this?</p>
<p>Manfred&#x27;s heart was capable of being touched.  He forgot his anger in  his astonishment; yet his pride forbad his owning himself affected.   He even doubted whether this discovery was not a contrivance of the  Friar to save the youth.</p>
<p>&quot;What may this mean?&quot; said he.  &quot;How can he be thy son?  Is it  consistent with thy profession or reputed sanctity to avow a peasant&#x27;s  offspring for the fruit of thy irregular amours!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, God!&quot; said the holy man, &quot;dost thou question his being mine?   Could I feel the anguish I do if I were not his father?  Spare him!  good Prince! spare him! and revile me as thou pleasest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Spare him! spare him!&quot; cried the attendants; &quot;for this good man&#x27;s  sake!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Peace!&quot; said Manfred, sternly.  &quot;I must know more ere I am disposed  to pardon.  A Saint&#x27;s bastard may be no saint himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Injurious Lord!&quot; said Theodore, &quot;add not insult to cruelty.  If I am  this venerable man&#x27;s son, though no Prince, as thou art, know the  blood that flows in my veins - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Friar, interrupting him, &quot;his blood is noble; nor is  he that abject thing, my Lord, you speak him.  He is my lawful son,  and Sicily can boast of few houses more ancient than that of  Falconara.  But alas! my Lord, what is blood! what is nobility!  We  are all reptiles, miserable, sinful creatures.  It is piety alone that  can distinguish us from the dust whence we sprung, and whither we must  return.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truce to your sermon,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;you forget you are no longer  Friar Jerome, but the Count of Falconara.  Let me know your history;  you will have time to moralise hereafter, if you should not happen to  obtain the grace of that sturdy criminal there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mother of God!&quot; said the Friar, &quot;is it possible my Lord can refuse a  father the life of his only, his long-lost, child!  Trample me, my  Lord, scorn, afflict me, accept my life for his, but spare my son!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou canst feel, then,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;what it is to lose an only  son!  A little hour ago thou didst preach up resignation to me:  MY  house, if fate so pleased, must perish - but the Count of Falconara -  &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas! my Lord,&quot; said Jerome, &quot;I confess I have offended; but  aggravate not an old man&#x27;s sufferings!  I boast not of my family, nor  think of such vanities - it is nature, that pleads for this boy; it is  the memory of the dear woman that bore him.  Is she, Theodore, is she  dead?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her soul has long been with the blessed,&quot; said Theodore.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! how?&quot; cried Jerome, &quot;tell me - no - she is happy!  Thou art all  my care now! - Most dread Lord! will you - will you grant me my poor  boy&#x27;s life?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Return to thy convent,&quot; answered Manfred; &quot;conduct the Princess  hither; obey me in what else thou knowest; and I promise thee the life  of thy son.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! my Lord,&quot; said Jerome, &quot;is my honesty the price I must pay for  this dear youth&#x27;s safety?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For me!&quot; cried Theodore.  &quot;Let me die a thousand deaths, rather than  stain thy conscience.  What is it the tyrant would exact of thee?  Is  the Princess still safe from his power?  Protect her, thou venerable  old man; and let all the weight of his wrath fall on me.&quot;</p>
<p>Jerome endeavoured to check the impetuosity of the youth; and ere  Manfred could reply, the trampling of horses was heard, and a brazen  trumpet, which hung without the gate of the castle, was suddenly  sounded.  At the same instant the sable plumes on the enchanted  helmet, which still remained at the other end of the court, were  tempestuously agitated, and nodded thrice, as if bowed by some  invisible wearer.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<p>MANFRED&#x27;S heart misgave him when he beheld the plumage on the  miraculous casque shaken in concert with the sounding of the brazen  trumpet.</p>
<p>&quot;Father!&quot; said he to Jerome, whom he now ceased to treat as Count of  Falconara, &quot;what mean these portents?  If I have offended - &quot; the  plumes were shaken with greater violence than before.</p>
<p>&quot;Unhappy Prince that I am,&quot; cried Manfred.  &quot;Holy Father! will you not  assist me with your prayers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; replied Jerome, &quot;heaven is no doubt displeased with your  mockery of its servants.  Submit yourself to the church; and cease to  persecute her ministers.  Dismiss this innocent youth; and learn to  respect the holy character I wear.  Heaven will not be trifled with:   you see - &quot; the trumpet sounded again.</p>
<p>&quot;I acknowledge I have been too hasty,&quot; said Manfred.  &quot;Father, do you  go to the wicket, and demand who is at the gate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you grant me the life of Theodore?&quot; replied the Friar.</p>
<p>&quot;I do,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;but inquire who is without!&quot;</p>
<p>Jerome, falling on the neck of his son, discharged a flood of tears,  that spoke the fulness of his soul.</p>
<p>&quot;You promised to go to the gate,&quot; said Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought,&quot; replied the Friar, &quot;your Highness would excuse my  thanking you first in this tribute of my heart.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go, dearest Sir,&quot; said Theodore; &quot;obey the Prince.  I do not deserve  that you should delay his satisfaction for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Jerome, inquiring who was without, was answered, &quot;A Herald.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From whom?&quot; said he.</p>
<p>&quot;From the Knight of the Gigantic Sabre,&quot; said the Herald; &quot;and I must  speak with the usurper of Otranto.&quot;</p>
<p>Jerome returned to the Prince, and did not fail to repeat the message  in the very words it had been uttered.  The first sounds struck  Manfred with terror; but when he heard himself styled usurper, his  rage rekindled, and all his courage revived.</p>
<p>&quot;Usurper! - insolent villain!&quot; cried he; &quot;who dares to question my  title?  Retire, Father; this is no business for Monks:  I will meet  this presumptuous man myself.  Go to your convent and prepare the  Princess&#x27;s return.  Your son shall be a hostage for your fidelity:   his life depends on your obedience.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good heaven! my Lord,&quot; cried Jerome, &quot;your Highness did but this  instant freely pardon my child - have you so soon forgot the  interposition of heaven?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heaven,&quot; replied Manfred, &quot;does not send Heralds to question the  title of a lawful Prince.  I doubt whether it even notifies its will  through Friars - but that is your affair, not mine.  At present you  know my pleasure; and it is not a saucy Herald that shall save your  son, if you do not return with the Princess.&quot;</p>
<p>It was in vain for the holy man to reply.  Manfred commanded him to be  conducted to the postern-gate, and shut out from the castle.  And he  ordered some of his attendants to carry Theodore to the top of the  black tower, and guard him strictly; scarce permitting the father and  son to exchange a hasty embrace at parting.  He then withdrew to the  hall, and seating himself in princely state, ordered the Herald to be  admitted to his presence.</p>
<p>&quot;Well! thou insolent!&quot; said the Prince, &quot;what wouldst thou with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I come,&quot; replied he, &quot;to thee, Manfred, usurper of the principality  of Otranto, from the renowned and invincible Knight, the Knight of the  Gigantic Sabre:  in the name of his Lord, Frederic, Marquis of  Vicenza, he demands the Lady Isabella, daughter of that Prince, whom  thou hast basely and traitorously got into thy power, by bribing her  false guardians during his absence; and he requires thee to resign the  principality of Otranto, which thou hast usurped from the said Lord  Frederic, the nearest of blood to the last rightful Lord, Alfonso the  Good.  If thou dost not instantly comply with these just demands, he  defies thee to single combat to the last extremity.&quot;  And so saying  the Herald cast down his warder.</p>
<p>&quot;And where is this braggart who sends thee?&quot; said Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;At the distance of a league,&quot; said the Herald:  &quot;he comes to make  good his Lord&#x27;s claim against thee, as he is a true knight, and thou  an usurper and ravisher.&quot;</p>
<p>Injurious as this challenge was, Manfred reflected that it was not his  interest to provoke the Marquis.  He knew how well founded the claim  of Frederic was; nor was this the first time he had heard of it.   Frederic&#x27;s ancestors had assumed the style of Princes of Otranto, from  the death of Alfonso the Good without issue; but Manfred, his father,  and grandfather, had been too powerful for the house of Vicenza to  dispossess them.  Frederic, a martial and amorous young Prince, had  married a beautiful young lady, of whom he was enamoured, and who had  died in childbed of Isabella.  Her death affected him so much that he  had taken the cross and gone to the Holy Land, where he was wounded in  an engagement against the infidels, made prisoner, and reported to be  dead.  When the news reached Manfred&#x27;s ears, he bribed the guardians  of the Lady Isabella to deliver her up to him as a bride for his son  Conrad, by which alliance he had proposed to unite the claims of the  two houses.  This motive, on Conrad&#x27;s death, had co-operated to make  him so suddenly resolve on espousing her himself; and the same  reflection determined him now to endeavour at obtaining the consent of  Frederic to this marriage.  A like policy inspired him with the  thought of inviting Frederic&#x27;s champion into the castle, lest he  should be informed of Isabella&#x27;s flight, which he strictly enjoined  his domestics not to disclose to any of the Knight&#x27;s retinue.</p>
<p>&quot;Herald,&quot; said Manfred, as soon as he had digested these reflections,  &quot;return to thy master, and tell him, ere we liquidate our differences  by the sword, Manfred would hold some converse with him.  Bid him  welcome to my castle, where by my faith, as I am a true Knight, he  shall have courteous reception, and full security for himself and  followers.  If we cannot adjust our quarrel by amicable means, I swear  he shall depart in safety, and shall have full satisfaction according  to the laws of arms:  So help me God and His holy Trinity!&quot;</p>
<p>The Herald made three obeisances and retired.</p>
<p>During this interview Jerome&#x27;s mind was agitated by a thousand  contrary passions.  He trembled for the life of his son, and his first  thought was to persuade Isabella to return to the castle.  Yet he was  scarce less alarmed at the thought of her union with Manfred.  He  dreaded Hippolita&#x27;s unbounded submission to the will of her Lord; and  though he did not doubt but he could alarm her piety not to consent to  a divorce, if he could get access to her; yet should Manfred discover  that the obstruction came from him, it might be equally fatal to  Theodore.  He was impatient to know whence came the Herald, who with  so little management had questioned the title of Manfred:  yet he did  not dare absent himself from the convent, lest Isabella should leave  it, and her flight be imputed to him.  He returned disconsolately to  the monastery, uncertain on what conduct to resolve.  A Monk, who met  him in the porch and observed his melancholy air, said -</p>
<p>&quot;Alas! brother, is it then true that we have lost our excellent  Princess Hippolita?&quot;</p>
<p>The holy man started, and cried, &quot;What meanest thou, brother?  I come  this instant from the castle, and left her in perfect health.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Martelli,&quot; replied the other Friar, &quot;passed by the convent but a  quarter of an hour ago on his way from the castle, and reported that  her Highness was dead.  All our brethren are gone to the chapel to  pray for her happy transit to a better life, and willed me to wait thy  arrival.  They know thy holy attachment to that good Lady, and are  anxious for the affliction it will cause in thee - indeed we have all  reason to weep; she was a mother to our house.  But this life is but a  pilgrimage; we must not murmur - we shall all follow her!  May our end  be like hers!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good brother, thou dreamest,&quot; said Jerome.  &quot;I tell thee I come from  the castle, and left the Princess well.  Where is the Lady Isabella?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poor Gentlewoman!&quot; replied the Friar; &quot;I told her the sad news, and  offered her spiritual comfort.  I reminded her of the transitory  condition of mortality, and advised her to take the veil:  I quoted  the example of the holy Princess Sanchia of Arragon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thy zeal was laudable,&quot; said Jerome, impatiently; &quot;but at present it  was unnecessary:  Hippolita is well - at least I trust in the Lord she  is; I heard nothing to the contrary - yet, methinks, the Prince&#x27;s  earnestness - Well, brother, but where is the Lady Isabella?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know not,&quot; said the Friar; &quot;she wept much, and said she would  retire to her chamber.&quot;</p>
<p>Jerome left his comrade abruptly, and hastened to the Princess, but  she was not in her chamber.  He inquired of the domestics of the  convent, but could learn no news of her.  He searched in vain  throughout the monastery and the church, and despatched messengers  round the neighbourhood, to get intelligence if she had been seen; but  to no purpose.  Nothing could equal the good man&#x27;s perplexity.  He  judged that Isabella, suspecting Manfred of having precipitated his  wife&#x27;s death, had taken the alarm, and withdrawn herself to some more  secret place of concealment.  This new flight would probably carry the  Prince&#x27;s fury to the height.  The report of Hippolita&#x27;s death, though  it seemed almost incredible, increased his consternation; and though  Isabella&#x27;s escape bespoke her aversion of Manfred for a husband,  Jerome could feel no comfort from it, while it endangered the life of  his son.  He determined to return to the castle, and made several of  his brethren accompany him to attest his innocence to Manfred, and, if  necessary, join their intercession with his for Theodore.</p>
<p>The Prince, in the meantime, had passed into the court, and ordered  the gates of the castle to be flung open for the reception of the  stranger Knight and his train.  In a few minutes the cavalcade  arrived.  First came two harbingers with wands.  Next a herald,  followed by two pages and two trumpets.  Then a hundred foot-guards.   These were attended by as many horse.  After them fifty footmen,  clothed in scarlet and black, the colours of the Knight.  Then a led  horse.  Two heralds on each side of a gentleman on horseback bearing a  banner with the arms of Vicenza and Otranto quarterly - a circumstance  that much offended Manfred - but he stifled his resentment.  Two more  pages.  The Knight&#x27;s confessor telling his beads.  Fifty more footmen  clad as before.  Two Knights habited in complete armour, their beavers  down, comrades to the principal Knight.  The squires of the two  Knights, carrying their shields and devices.  The Knight&#x27;s own squire.   A hundred gentlemen bearing an enormous sword, and seeming to faint  under the weight of it.  The Knight himself on a chestnut steed, in  complete armour, his lance in the rest, his face entirely concealed by  his vizor, which was surmounted by a large plume of scarlet and black  feathers.  Fifty foot-guards with drums and trumpets closed the  procession, which wheeled off to the right and left to make room for  the principal Knight.</p>
<p>As soon as he approached the gate he stopped; and the herald  advancing, read again the words of the challenge.  Manfred&#x27;s eyes were  fixed on the gigantic sword, and he scarce seemed to attend to the  cartel:  but his attention was soon diverted by a tempest of wind that  rose behind him.  He turned and beheld the Plumes of the enchanted  helmet agitated in the same extraordinary manner as before.  It  required intrepidity like Manfred&#x27;s not to sink under a concurrence of  circumstances that seemed to announce his fate.  Yet scorning in the  presence of strangers to betray the courage he had always manifested,  he said boldly -</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Knight, whoever thou art, I bid thee welcome.  If thou art of  mortal mould, thy valour shall meet its equal:  and if thou art a true  Knight, thou wilt scorn to employ sorcery to carry thy point.  Be  these omens from heaven or hell, Manfred trusts to the righteousness  of his cause and to the aid of St. Nicholas, who has ever protected  his house.  Alight, Sir Knight, and repose thyself.  To-morrow thou  shalt have a fair field, and heaven befriend the juster side!&quot;</p>
<p>The Knight made no reply, but dismounting, was conducted by Manfred to  the great hall of the castle.  As they traversed the court, the Knight  stopped to gaze on the miraculous casque; and kneeling down, seemed to  pray inwardly for some minutes.  Rising, he made a sign to the Prince  to lead on.  As soon as they entered the hall, Manfred proposed to the  stranger to disarm, but the Knight shook his head in token of refusal.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Knight,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;this is not courteous, but by my good  faith I will not cross thee, nor shalt thou have cause to complain of  the Prince of Otranto.  No treachery is designed on my part; I hope  none is intended on thine; here take my gage&quot; (giving him his ring):   &quot;your friends and you shall enjoy the laws of hospitality.  Rest here  until refreshments are brought.  I will but give orders for the  accommodation of your train, and return to you.&quot;  The three Knights  bowed as accepting his courtesy.  Manfred directed the stranger&#x27;s  retinue to be conducted to an adjacent hospital, founded by the  Princess Hippolita for the reception of pilgrims.  As they made the  circuit of the court to return towards the gate, the gigantic sword  burst from the supporters, and falling to the ground opposite to the  helmet, remained immovable.  Manfred, almost hardened to preternatural  appearances, surmounted the shock of this new prodigy; and returning  to the hall, where by this time the feast was ready, he invited his  silent guests to take their places.  Manfred, however ill his heart  was at ease, endeavoured to inspire the company with mirth.  He put  several questions to them, but was answered only by signs.  They  raised their vizors but sufficiently to feed themselves, and that  sparingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Sirs&quot; said the Prince, &quot;ye are the first guests I ever treated within  these walls who scorned to hold any intercourse with me:  nor has it  oft been customary, I ween, for princes to hazard their state and  dignity against strangers and mutes.  You say you come in the name of  Frederic of Vicenza; I have ever heard that he was a gallant and  courteous Knight; nor would he, I am bold to say, think it beneath him  to mix in social converse with a Prince that is his equal, and not  unknown by deeds in arms.  Still ye are silent - well! be it as it may  - by the laws of hospitality and chivalry ye are masters under this  roof:  ye shall do your pleasure.  But come, give me a goblet of wine;  ye will not refuse to pledge me to the healths of your fair  mistresses.&quot;</p>
<p>The principal Knight sighed and crossed himself, and was rising from  the board.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Knight,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;what I said was but in sport.  I shall  constrain you in nothing:  use your good liking.  Since mirth is not  your mood, let us be sad.  Business may hit your fancies better.  Let  us withdraw, and hear if what I have to unfold may be better relished  than the vain efforts I have made for your pastime.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred then conducting the three Knights into an inner chamber, shut  the door, and inviting them to be seated, began thus, addressing  himself to the chief personage:-</p>
<p>&quot;You come, Sir Knight, as I understand, in the name of the Marquis of  Vicenza, to re-demand the Lady Isabella, his daughter, who has been  contracted in the face of Holy Church to my son, by the consent of her  legal guardians; and to require me to resign my dominions to your  Lord, who gives himself for the nearest of blood to Prince Alfonso,  whose soul God rest!  I shall speak to the latter article of your  demands first.  You must know, your Lord knows, that I enjoy the  principality of Otranto from my father, Don Manuel, as he received it  from his father, Don Ricardo.  Alfonso, their predecessor, dying  childless in the Holy Land, bequeathed his estates to my grandfather,  Don Ricardo, in consideration of his faithful services.&quot;  The stranger  shook his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir Knight,&quot; said Manfred, warmly, &quot;Ricardo was a valiant and upright  man; he was a pious man; witness his munificent foundation of the  adjoining church and two converts.  He was peculiarly patronised by  St. Nicholas - my grandfather was incapable - I say, Sir, Don Ricardo  was incapable - excuse me, your interruption has disordered me.  I  venerate the memory of my grandfather.  Well, Sirs, he held this  estate; he held it by his good sword and by the favour of St. Nicholas  - so did my father; and so, Sirs, will I, come what come will.  But  Frederic, your Lord, is nearest in blood.  I have consented to put my  title to the issue of the sword.  Does that imply a vicious title?  I  might have asked, where is Frederic your Lord?  Report speaks him dead  in captivity.  You say, your actions say, he lives - I question it not  - I might, Sirs, I might - but I do not.  Other Princes would bid  Frederic take his inheritance by force, if he can:  they would not  stake their dignity on a single combat:  they would not submit it to  the decision of unknown mutes! - pardon me, gentlemen, I am too warm:   but suppose yourselves in my situation:  as ye are stout Knights,  would it not move your choler to have your own and the honour of your  ancestors called in question?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But to the point.  Ye require me to deliver up the Lady Isabella.   Sirs, I must ask if ye are authorised to receive her?&quot;</p>
<p>The Knight nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Receive her,&quot; continued Manfred; &quot;well, you are authorised to receive  her, but, gentle Knight, may I ask if you have full powers?&quot;</p>
<p>The Knight nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tis well,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;then hear what I have to offer.  Ye see,  gentlemen, before you, the most unhappy of men!&quot; (he began to weep);  &quot;afford me your compassion; I am entitled to it, indeed I am.  Know, I  have lost my only hope, my joy, the support of my house - Conrad died  yester morning.&quot;</p>
<p>The Knights discovered signs of surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Sirs, fate has disposed of my son.  Isabella is at liberty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you then restore her?&quot; cried the chief Knight, breaking silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Afford me your patience,&quot; said Manfred.  &quot;I rejoice to find, by this  testimony of your goodwill, that this matter may be adjusted without  blood.  It is no interest of mine dictates what little I have farther  to say.  Ye behold in me a man disgusted with the world:  the loss of  my son has weaned me from earthly cares.  Power and greatness have no  longer any charms in my eyes.  I wished to transmit the sceptre I had  received from my ancestors with honour to my son - but that is over!   Life itself is so indifferent to me, that I accepted your defiance  with joy.  A good Knight cannot go to the grave with more satisfaction  than when falling in his vocation:  whatever is the will of heaven, I  submit; for alas! Sirs, I am a man of many sorrows.  Manfred is no  object of envy, but no doubt you are acquainted with my story.&quot;</p>
<p>The Knight made signs of ignorance, and seemed curious to have Manfred  proceed.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible, Sirs,&quot; continued the Prince, &quot;that my story should be  a secret to you?  Have you heard nothing relating to me and the  Princess Hippolita?&quot;</p>
<p>They shook their heads.</p>
<p>&quot;No!  Thus, then, Sirs, it is.  You think me ambitious:  ambition,  alas! is composed of more rugged materials.  If I were ambitious, I  should not for so many years have been a prey to all the hell of  conscientious scruples.  But I weary your patience:  I will be brief.   Know, then, that I have long been troubled in mind on my union with  the Princess Hippolita.  Oh! Sirs, if ye were acquainted with that  excellent woman! if ye knew that I adore her like a mistress, and  cherish her as a friend - but man was not born for perfect happiness!   She shares my scruples, and with her consent I have brought this  matter before the church, for we are related within the forbidden  degrees.  I expect every hour the definitive sentence that must  separate us for ever - I am sure you feel for me - I see you do -  pardon these tears!&quot;</p>
<p>The Knights gazed on each other, wondering where this would end.</p>
<p>Manfred continued -</p>
<p>&quot;The death of my son betiding while my soul was under this anxiety, I  thought of nothing but resigning my dominions, and retiring for ever  from the sight of mankind.  My only difficulty was to fix on a  successor, who would be tender of my people, and to dispose of the  Lady Isabella, who is dear to me as my own blood.  I was willing to  restore the line of Alfonso, even in his most distant kindred.  And  though, pardon me, I am satisfied it was his will that Ricardo&#x27;s  lineage should take place of his own relations; yet where was I to  search for those relations?  I knew of none but Frederic, your Lord;  he was a captive to the infidels, or dead; and were he living, and at  home, would he quit the flourishing State of Vicenza for the  inconsiderable principality of Otranto?  If he would not, could I bear  the thought of seeing a hard, unfeeling, Viceroy set over my poor  faithful people? for, Sirs, I love my people, and thank heaven am  beloved by them.  But ye will ask whither tends this long discourse?   Briefly, then, thus, Sirs.  Heaven in your arrival seems to point out  a remedy for these difficulties and my misfortunes.  The Lady Isabella  is at liberty; I shall soon be so.  I would submit to anything for the  good of my people.  Were it not the best, the only way to extinguish  the feuds between our families, if I was to take the Lady Isabella to  wife?  You start.  But though Hippolita&#x27;s virtues will ever be dear to  me, a Prince must not consider himself; he is born for his people.&quot;  A  servant at that instant entering the chamber apprised Manfred that  Jerome and several of his brethren demanded immediate access to him.</p>
<p>The Prince, provoked at this interruption, and fearing that the Friar  would discover to the strangers that Isabella had taken sanctuary, was  going to forbid Jerome&#x27;s entrance.  But recollecting that he was  certainly arrived to notify the Princess&#x27;s return, Manfred began to  excuse himself to the Knights for leaving them for a few moments, but  was prevented by the arrival of the Friars.  Manfred angrily  reprimanded them for their intrusion, and would have forced them back  from the chamber; but Jerome was too much agitated to be repulsed.  He  declared aloud the flight of Isabella, with protestations of his own  innocence.</p>
<p>Manfred, distracted at the news, and not less at its coming to the  knowledge of the strangers, uttered nothing but incoherent sentences,  now upbraiding the Friar, now apologising to the Knights, earnest to  know what was become of Isabella, yet equally afraid of their knowing;  impatient to pursue her, yet dreading to have them join in the  pursuit.  He offered to despatch messengers in quest of her, but the  chief Knight, no longer keeping silence, reproached Manfred in bitter  terms for his dark and ambiguous dealing, and demanded the cause of  Isabella&#x27;s first absence from the castle.  Manfred, casting a stern  look at Jerome, implying a command of silence, pretended that on  Conrad&#x27;s death he had placed her in sanctuary until he could determine  how to dispose of her.  Jerome, who trembled for his son&#x27;s life, did  not dare contradict this falsehood, but one of his brethren, not under  the same anxiety, declared frankly that she had fled to their church  in the preceding night.  The Prince in vain endeavoured to stop this  discovery, which overwhelmed him with shame and confusion.  The  principal stranger, amazed at the contradictions he heard, and more  than half persuaded that Manfred had secreted the Princess,  notwithstanding the concern he expressed at her flight, rushing to the  door, said -</p>
<p>&quot;Thou traitor Prince!  Isabella shall be found.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred endeavoured to hold him, but the other Knights assisting their  comrade, he broke from the Prince, and hastened into the court,  demanding his attendants.  Manfred, finding it vain to divert him from  the pursuit, offered to accompany him and summoning his attendants,  and taking Jerome and some of the Friars to guide them, they issued  from the castle; Manfred privately giving orders to have the Knight&#x27;s  company secured, while to the knight he affected to despatch a  messenger to require their assistance.</p>
<p>The company had no sooner quitted the castle than Matilda, who felt  herself deeply interested for the young peasant, since she had seen  him condemned to death in the hall, and whose thoughts had been taken  up with concerting measures to save him, was informed by some of the  female attendants that Manfred had despatched all his men various ways  in pursuit of Isabella.  He had in his hurry given this order in  general terms, not meaning to extend it to the guard he had set upon  Theodore, but forgetting it.  The domestics, officious to obey so  peremptory a Prince, and urged by their own curiosity and love of  novelty to join in any precipitate chase, had to a man left the  castle.  Matilda disengaged herself from her women, stole up to the  black tower, and unbolting the door, presented herself to the  astonished Theodore.</p>
<p>&quot;Young man,&quot; said she, &quot;though filial duty and womanly modesty condemn  the step I am taking, yet holy charity, surmounting all other ties,  justifies this act.  Fly; the doors of thy prison are open:  my father  and his domestics are absent; but they may soon return.  Be gone in  safety; and may the angels of heaven direct thy course!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art surely one of those angels!&quot; said the enraptured Theodore:   &quot;none but a blessed saint could speak, could act - could look - like  thee.  May I not know the name of my divine protectress?  Methought  thou namedst thy father.  Is it possible?  Can Manfred&#x27;s blood feel  holy pity!  Lovely Lady, thou answerest not.  But how art thou here  thyself?  Why dost thou neglect thy own safety, and waste a thought on  a wretch like Theodore?  Let us fly together:  the life thou bestowest  shall be dedicated to thy defence.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas! thou mistakest,&quot; said Matilda, signing:  &quot;I am Manfred&#x27;s  daughter, but no dangers await me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Amazement!&quot; said Theodore; &quot;but last night I blessed myself for  yielding thee the service thy gracious compassion so charitably  returns me now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Still thou art in an error,&quot; said the Princess; &quot;but this is no time  for explanation.  Fly, virtuous youth, while it is in my power to save  thee:  should my father return, thou and I both should indeed have  cause to tremble.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How!&quot; said Theodore; &quot;thinkest thou, charming maid, that I will  accept of life at the hazard of aught calamitous to thee?  Better I  endured a thousand deaths.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I run no risk,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;but by thy delay.  Depart; it cannot  be known that I have assisted thy flight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Swear by the saints above,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;that thou canst not be  suspected; else here I vow to await whatever can befall me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! thou art too generous,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;but rest assured that no  suspicion can alight on me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give me thy beauteous hand in token that thou dost not deceive me,&quot;  said Theodore; &quot;and let me bathe it with the warm tears of gratitude.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forbear!&quot; said the Princess; &quot;this must not be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas!&quot; said Theodore, &quot;I have never known but calamity until this  hour - perhaps shall never know other fortune again:  suffer the  chaste raptures of holy gratitude:  &#x27;tis my soul would print its  effusions on thy hand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forbear, and be gone,&quot; said Matilda.  &quot;How would Isabella approve of  seeing thee at my feet?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is Isabella?&quot; said the young man with surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, me!  I fear,&quot; said the Princess, &quot;I am serving a deceitful one.   Hast thou forgot thy curiosity this morning?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thy looks, thy actions, all thy beauteous self seem an emanation of  divinity,&quot; said Theodore; &quot;but thy words are dark and mysterious.   Speak, Lady; speak to thy servant&#x27;s comprehension.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou understandest but too well!&quot; said Matilda; &quot;but once more I  command thee to be gone:  thy blood, which I may preserve, will be on  my head, if I waste the time in vain discourse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I go, Lady,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;because it is thy will, and because I  would not bring the grey hairs of my father with sorrow to the grave.   Say but, adored Lady, that I have thy gentle pity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;I will conduct thee to the subterraneous vault  by which Isabella escaped; it will lead thee to the church of St.  Nicholas, where thou mayst take sanctuary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; said Theodore, &quot;was it another, and not thy lovely self that I  assisted to find the subterraneous passage?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;but ask no more; I tremble to see thee still  abide here; fly to the sanctuary.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To sanctuary,&quot; said Theodore; &quot;no, Princess; sanctuaries are for  helpless damsels, or for criminals.  Theodore&#x27;s soul is free from  guilt, nor will wear the appearance of it.  Give me a sword, Lady, and  thy father shall learn that Theodore scorns an ignominious flight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rash youth!&quot; said Matilda; &quot;thou wouldst not dare to lift thy  presumptuous arm against the Prince of Otranto?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not against thy father; indeed, I dare not,&quot; said Theodore.  &quot;Excuse  me, Lady; I had forgotten.  But could I gaze on thee, and remember  thou art sprung from the tyrant Manfred!  But he is thy father, and  from this moment my injuries are buried in oblivion.&quot;</p>
<p>A deep and hollow groan, which seemed to come from above, startled the  Princess and Theodore.</p>
<p>&quot;Good heaven! we are overheard!&quot; said the Princess.  They listened;  but perceiving no further noise, they both concluded it the effect of  pent-up vapours.  And the Princess, preceding Theodore softly, carried  him to her father&#x27;s armoury, where, equipping him with a complete  suit, he was conducted by Matilda to the postern-gate.</p>
<p>&quot;Avoid the town,&quot; said the Princess, &quot;and all the western side of the  castle.  &#x27;Tis there the search must be making by Manfred and the  strangers; but hie thee to the opposite quarter.  Yonder behind that  forest to the east is a chain of rocks, hollowed into a labyrinth of  caverns that reach to the sea coast.  There thou mayst lie concealed,  till thou canst make signs to some vessel to put on shore, and take  thee off.  Go! heaven be thy guide! - and sometimes in thy prayers  remember - Matilda!&quot;</p>
<p>Theodore flung himself at her feet, and seizing her lily hand, which  with struggles she suffered him to kiss, he vowed on the earliest  opportunity to get himself knighted, and fervently entreated her  permission to swear himself eternally her knight.  Ere the Princess  could reply, a clap of thunder was suddenly heard that shook the  battlements.  Theodore, regardless of the tempest, would have urged  his suit:  but the Princess, dismayed, retreated hastily into the  castle, and commanded the youth to be gone with an air that would not  be disobeyed.  He sighed, and retired, but with eyes fixed on the  gate, until Matilda, closing it, put an end to an interview, in which  the hearts of both had drunk so deeply of a passion, which both now  tasted for the first time.</p>
<p>Theodore went pensively to the convent, to acquaint his father with  his deliverance.  There he learned the absence of Jerome, and the  pursuit that was making after the Lady Isabella, with some particulars  of whose story he now first became acquainted.  The generous gallantry  of his nature prompted him to wish to assist her; but the Monks could  lend him no lights to guess at the route she had taken.  He was not  tempted to wander far in search of her, for the idea of Matilda had  imprinted itself so strongly on his heart, that he could not bear to  absent himself at much distance from her abode.  The tenderness Jerome  had expressed for him concurred to confirm this reluctance; and he  even persuaded himself that filial affection was the chief cause of  his hovering between the castle and monastery.</p>
<p>Until Jerome should return at night, Theodore at length determined to  repair to the forest that Matilda had pointed out to him.  Arriving  there, he sought the gloomiest shades, as best suited to the pleasing  melancholy that reigned in his mind.  In this mood he roved insensibly  to the caves which had formerly served as a retreat to hermits, and  were now reported round the country to be haunted by evil spirits.  He  recollected to have heard this tradition; and being of a brave and  adventurous disposition, he willingly indulged his curiosity in  exploring the secret recesses of this labyrinth.  He had not  penetrated far before he thought he heard the steps of some person who  seemed to retreat before him.</p>
<p>Theodore, though firmly grounded in all our holy faith enjoins to be  believed, had no apprehension that good men were abandoned without  cause to the malice of the powers of darkness.  He thought the place  more likely to be infested by robbers than by those infernal agents  who are reported to molest and bewilder travellers.  He had long  burned with impatience to approve his valour.  Drawing his sabre, he  marched sedately onwards, still directing his steps as the imperfect  rustling sound before him led the way.  The armour he wore was a like  indication to the person who avoided him.  Theodore, now convinced  that he was not mistaken, redoubled his pace, and evidently gained on  the person that fled, whose haste increasing, Theodore came up just as  a woman fell breathless before him.  He hasted to raise her, but her  terror was so great that he apprehended she would faint in his arms.   He used every gentle word to dispel her alarms, and assured her that  far from injuring, he would defend her at the peril of his life.  The  Lady recovering her spirits from his courteous demeanour, and gazing  on her protector, said -</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, I have heard that voice before!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not to my knowledge,&quot; replied Theodore; &quot;unless, as I conjecture,  thou art the Lady Isabella.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Merciful heaven!&quot; cried she.  &quot;Thou art not sent in quest of me, art  thou?&quot;  And saying those words, she threw herself at his feet, and  besought him not to deliver her up to Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;To Manfred!&quot; cried Theodore - &quot;no, Lady; I have once already  delivered thee from his tyranny, and it shall fare hard with me now,  but I will place thee out of the reach of his daring.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it possible,&quot; said she, &quot;that thou shouldst be the generous  unknown whom I met last night in the vault of the castle?  Sure thou  art not a mortal, but my guardian angel.  On my knees, let me thank -  &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold! gentle Princess,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;nor demean thyself before a  poor and friendless young man.  If heaven has selected me for thy  deliverer, it will accomplish its work, and strengthen my arm in thy  cause.  But come, Lady, we are too near the mouth of the cavern; let  us seek its inmost recesses.  I can have no tranquillity till I have  placed thee beyond the reach of danger.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas! what mean you, sir?&quot; said she.  &quot;Though all your actions are  noble, though your sentiments speak the purity of your soul, is it  fitting that I should accompany you alone into these perplexed  retreats?  Should we be found together, what would a censorious world  think of my conduct?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I respect your virtuous delicacy,&quot; said Theodore; &quot;nor do you harbour  a suspicion that wounds my honour.  I meant to conduct you into the  most private cavity of these rocks, and then at the hazard of my life  to guard their entrance against every living thing.  Besides, Lady,&quot;  continued he, drawing a deep sigh, &quot;beauteous and all perfect as your  form is, and though my wishes are not guiltless of aspiring, know, my  soul is dedicated to another; and although - &quot;  A sudden noise  prevented Theodore from proceeding.  They soon distinguished these  sounds -</p>
<p>&quot;Isabella! what, ho! Isabella!&quot;  The trembling Princess relapsed into  her former agony of fear.  Theodore endeavoured to encourage her, but  in vain.  He assured her he would die rather than suffer her to return  under Manfred&#x27;s power; and begging her to remain concealed, he went  forth to prevent the person in search of her from approaching.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the cavern he found an armed Knight, discoursing with  a peasant, who assured him he had seen a lady enter the passes of the  rock.  The Knight was preparing to seek her, when Theodore, placing  himself in his way, with his sword drawn, sternly forbad him at his  peril to advance.</p>
<p>&quot;And who art thou, who darest to cross my way?&quot; said the Knight,  haughtily.</p>
<p>&quot;One who does not dare more than he will perform,&quot; said Theodore.</p>
<p>&quot;I seek the Lady Isabella,&quot; said the Knight, &quot;and understand she has  taken refuge among these rocks.  Impede me not, or thou wilt repent  having provoked my resentment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thy purpose is as odious as thy resentment is contemptible,&quot; said  Theodore.  &quot;Return whence thou camest, or we shall soon know whose  resentment is most terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>The stranger, who was the principal Knight that had arrived from the  Marquis of Vicenza, had galloped from Manfred as he was busied in  getting information of the Princess, and giving various orders to  prevent her falling into the power of the three Knights.  Their chief  had suspected Manfred of being privy to the Princess&#x27;s absconding, and  this insult from a man, who he concluded was stationed by that Prince  to secrete her, confirming his suspicions, he made no reply, but  discharging a blow with his sabre at Theodore, would soon have removed  all obstruction, if Theodore, who took him for one of Manfred&#x27;s  captains, and who had no sooner given the provocation than prepared to  support it, had not received the stroke on his shield.  The valour  that had so long been smothered in his breast broke forth at once; he  rushed impetuously on the Knight, whose pride and wrath were not less  powerful incentives to hardy deeds.  The combat was furious, but not  long.  Theodore wounded the Knight in three several places, and at  last disarmed him as he fainted by the loss of blood.</p>
<p>The peasant, who had fled on the first onset, had given the alarm to  some of Manfred&#x27;s domestics, who, by his orders, were dispersed  through the forest in pursuit of Isabella.  They came up as the Knight  fell, whom they soon discovered to be the noble stranger.  Theodore,  notwithstanding his hatred to Manfred, could not behold the victory he  had gained without emotions of pity and generosity.  But he was more  touched when he learned the quality of his adversary, and was informed  that he was no retainer, but an enemy, of Manfred.  He assisted the  servants of the latter in disarming the Knight, and in endeavouring to  stanch the blood that flowed from his wounds.  The Knight recovering  his speech, said, in a faint and faltering voice -</p>
<p>&quot;Generous foe, we have both been in an error.  I took thee for an  instrument of the tyrant; I perceive thou hast made the like mistake.   It is too late for excuses.  I faint.  If Isabella is at hand - call  her - I have important secrets to - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He is dying!&quot; said one of the attendants; &quot;has nobody a crucifix  about them?  Andrea, do thou pray over him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fetch some water,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;and pour it down his throat, while  I hasten to the Princess.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, he flew to Isabella, and in few words told her modestly  that he had been so unfortunate by mistake as to wound a gentleman  from her father&#x27;s court, who wished, ere he died, to impart something  of consequence to her.</p>
<p>The Princess, who had been transported at hearing the voice of  Theodore, as he called to her to come forth, was astonished at what  she heard.  Suffering herself to be conducted by Theodore, the new  proof of whose valour recalled her dispersed spirits, she came where  the bleeding Knight lay speechless on the ground.  But her fears  returned when she beheld the domestics of Manfred.  She would again  have fled if Theodore had not made her observe that they were unarmed,  and had not threatened them with instant death if they should dare to  seize the Princess.</p>
<p>The stranger, opening his eyes, and beholding a woman, said, &quot;Art thou  - pray tell me truly - art thou Isabella of Vicenza?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am,&quot; said she:  &quot;good heaven restore thee!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then thou - then thou&quot; - said the Knight, struggling for utterance -  &quot;seest - thy father.  Give me one - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! amazement! horror! what do I hear! what do I see!&quot; cried  Isabella.  &quot;My father!  You my father!  How came you here, Sir?  For  heaven&#x27;s sake, speak!  Oh! run for help, or he will expire!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Tis most true,&quot; said the wounded Knight, exerting all his force; &quot;I  am Frederic thy father.  Yes, I came to deliver thee.  It will not be.   Give me a parting kiss, and take - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;do not exhaust yourself; suffer us to convey  you to the castle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To the castle!&quot; said Isabella.  &quot;Is there no help nearer than the  castle?  Would you expose my father to the tyrant?  If he goes  thither, I dare not accompany him; and yet, can I leave him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My child,&quot; said Frederic, &quot;it matters not for me whither I am  carried.  A few minutes will place me beyond danger; but while I have  eyes to dote on thee, forsake me not, dear Isabella!  This brave  Knight - I know not who he is - will protect thy innocence.  Sir, you  will not abandon my child, will you?&quot;</p>
<p>Theodore, shedding tears over his victim, and vowing to guard the  Princess at the expense of his life, persuaded Frederic to suffer  himself to be conducted to the castle.  They placed him on a horse  belonging to one of the domestics, after binding up his wounds as well  as they were able.  Theodore marched by his side; and the afflicted  Isabella, who could not bear to quit him, followed mournfully behind.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>THE sorrowful troop no sooner arrived at the castle, than they were  met by Hippolita and Matilda, whom Isabella had sent one of the  domestics before to advertise of their approach.  The ladies causing  Frederic to be conveyed into the nearest chamber, retired, while the  surgeons examined his wounds.  Matilda blushed at seeing Theodore and  Isabella together; but endeavoured to conceal it by embracing the  latter, and condoling with her on her father&#x27;s mischance.  The  surgeons soon came to acquaint Hippolita that none of the Marquis&#x27;s  wounds were dangerous; and that he was desirous of seeing his daughter  and the Princesses.</p>
<p>Theodore, under pretence of expressing his joy at being freed from his  apprehensions of the combat being fatal to Frederic, could not resist  the impulse of following Matilda.  Her eyes were so often cast down on  meeting his, that Isabella, who regarded Theodore as attentively as he  gazed on Matilda, soon divined who the object was that he had told her  in the cave engaged his affections.  While this mute scene passed,  Hippolita demanded of Frederic the cause of his having taken that  mysterious course for reclaiming his daughter; and threw in various  apologies to excuse her Lord for the match contracted between their  children.</p>
<p>Frederic, however incensed against Manfred, was not insensible to the  courtesy and benevolence of Hippolita:  but he was still more struck  with the lovely form of Matilda.  Wishing to detain them by his  bedside, he informed Hippolita of his story.  He told her that, while  prisoner to the infidels, he had dreamed that his daughter, of whom he  had learned no news since his captivity, was detained in a castle,  where she was in danger of the most dreadful misfortunes:  and that if  he obtained his liberty, and repaired to a wood near Joppa, he would  learn more.  Alarmed at this dream, and incapable of obeying the  direction given by it, his chains became more grievous than ever.  But  while his thoughts were occupied on the means of obtaining his  liberty, he received the agreeable news that the confederate Princes  who were warring in Palestine had paid his ransom.  He instantly set  out for the wood that had been marked in his dream.</p>
<p>For three days he and his attendants had wandered in the forest  without seeing a human form:  but on the evening of the third they  came to a cell, in which they found a venerable hermit in the agonies  of death.  Applying rich cordials, they brought the fainting man to  his speech.</p>
<p>&quot;My sons,&quot; said he, &quot;I am bounden to your charity - but it is in vain  - I am going to my eternal rest - yet I die with the satisfaction of  performing the will of heaven.  When first I repaired to this  solitude, after seeing my country become a prey to unbelievers - it is  alas! above fifty years since I was witness to that dreadful scene!   St. Nicholas appeared to me, and revealed a secret, which he bade me  never disclose to mortal man, but on my death-bed.  This is that  tremendous hour, and ye are no doubt the chosen warriors to whom I was  ordered to reveal my trust.  As soon as ye have done the last offices  to this wretched corse, dig under the seventh tree on the left hand of  this poor cave, and your pains will - Oh! good heaven receive my  soul!&quot;  With those words the devout man breathed his last.</p>
<p>&quot;By break of day,&quot; continued Frederic, &quot;when we had committed the holy  relics to earth, we dug according to direction.  But what was our  astonishment when about the depth of six feet we discovered an  enormous sabre - the very weapon yonder in the court.  On the blade,  which was then partly out of the scabbard, though since closed by our  efforts in removing it, were written the following lines - no; excuse  me, Madam,&quot; added the Marquis, turning to Hippolita; &quot;if I forbear to  repeat them:  I respect your sex and rank, and would not be guilty of  offending your ear with sounds injurious to aught that is dear to  you.&quot;</p>
<p>He paused.  Hippolita trembled.  She did not doubt but Frederic was  destined by heaven to accomplish the fate that seemed to threaten her  house.  Looking with anxious fondness at Matilda, a silent tear stole  down her cheek:  but recollecting herself, she said -</p>
<p>&quot;Proceed, my Lord; heaven does nothing in vain; mortals must receive  its divine behests with lowliness and submission.  It is our part to  deprecate its wrath, or bow to its decrees.  Repeat the sentence, my  Lord; we listen resigned.&quot;</p>
<p>Frederic was grieved that he had proceeded so far.  The dignity and  patient firmness of Hippolita penetrated him with respect, and the  tender silent affection with which the Princess and her daughter  regarded each other, melted him almost to tears.  Yet apprehensive  that his forbearance to obey would be more alarming, he repeated in a  faltering and low voice the following lines:</p>
<p>&quot;Where&#x27;er a casque that suits this sword is found, With perils is thy daughter compass&#x27;d round; ALFONSO&#x27;S blood alone can save the maid, And quiet a long restless Prince&#x27;s shade.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is there in these lines,&quot; said Theodore impatiently, &quot;that  affects these Princesses?  Why were they to be shocked by a mysterious  delicacy, that has so little foundation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your words are rude, young man,&quot; said the Marquis; &quot;and though  fortune has favoured you once - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My honoured Lord,&quot; said Isabella, who resented Theodore&#x27;s warmth,  which she perceived was dictated by his sentiments for Matilda,  &quot;discompose not yourself for the glosing of a peasant&#x27;s son:  he  forgets the reverence he owes you; but he is not accustomed - &quot;</p>
<p>Hippolita, concerned at the heat that had arisen, checked Theodore for  his boldness, but with an air acknowledging his zeal; and changing the  conversation, demanded of Frederic where he had left her Lord?  As the  Marquis was going to reply, they heard a noise without, and rising to  inquire the cause, Manfred, Jerome, and part of the troop, who had met  an imperfect rumour of what had happened, entered the chamber.   Manfred advanced hastily towards Frederic&#x27;s bed to condole with him on  his misfortune, and to learn the circumstances of the combat, when  starting in an agony of terror and amazement, he cried -</p>
<p>&quot;Ha! what art thou? thou dreadful spectre! is my hour come?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dearest, gracious Lord,&quot; cried Hippolita, clasping him in her  arms, &quot;what is it you see!  Why do you fix your eye-balls thus?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; cried Manfred breathless; &quot;dost thou see nothing, Hippolita?   Is this ghastly phantom sent to me alone - to rue, who did not - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For mercy&#x27;s sweetest self, my Lord,&quot; said Hippolita, &quot;resume your  soul, command your reason.  There is none here, but us, your friends.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, is not that Alfonso?&quot; cried Manfred.  &quot;Dost thou not see him?  can it be my brain&#x27;s delirium?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This! my Lord,&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;this is Theodore, the youth who has  been so unfortunate.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Theodore!&quot; said Manfred mournfully, and striking his forehead;  &quot;Theodore or a phantom, he has unhinged the soul of Manfred.  But how  comes he here? and how comes he in armour?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe he went in search of Isabella,&quot; said Hippolita.</p>
<p>&quot;Of Isabella!&quot; said Manfred, relapsing into rage; &quot;yes, yes, that is  not doubtful -.  But how did he escape from durance in which I left  him?  Was it Isabella, or this hypocritical old Friar, that procured  his enlargement?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And would a parent be criminal, my Lord,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;if he  meditated the deliverance of his child?&quot;</p>
<p>Jerome, amazed to hear himself in a manner accused by his son, and  without foundation, knew not what to think.  He could not comprehend  how Theodore had escaped, how he came to be armed, and to encounter  Frederic.  Still he would not venture to ask any questions that might  tend to inflame Manfred&#x27;s wrath against his son.  Jerome&#x27;s silence  convinced Manfred that he had contrived Theodore&#x27;s release.</p>
<p>&quot;And is it thus, thou ungrateful old man,&quot; said the Prince, addressing  himself to the Friar, &quot;that thou repayest mine and Hippolita&#x27;s  bounties?  And not content with traversing my heart&#x27;s nearest wishes,  thou armest thy bastard, and bringest him into my own castle to insult  me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;you wrong my father:  neither he nor I are  capable of harbouring a thought against your peace.  Is it insolence  thus to surrender myself to your Highness&#x27;s pleasure?&quot; added he,  laying his sword respectfully at Manfred&#x27;s feet.  &quot;Behold my bosom;  strike, my Lord, if you suspect that a disloyal thought is lodged  there.  There is not a sentiment engraven on my heart that does not  venerate you and yours.&quot;</p>
<p>The grace and fervour with which Theodore uttered these words  interested every person present in his favour.  Even Manfred was  touched - yet still possessed with his resemblance to Alfonso, his  admiration was dashed with secret horror.</p>
<p>&quot;Rise,&quot; said he; &quot;thy life is not my present purpose.  But tell me thy  history, and how thou camest connected with this old traitor here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; said Jerome eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;Peace! impostor!&quot; said Manfred; &quot;I will not have him prompted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;I want no assistance; my story is very  brief.  I was carried at five years of age to Algiers with my mother,  who had been taken by corsairs from the coast of Sicily.  She died of  grief in less than a twelvemonth;&quot; the tears gushed from Jerome&#x27;s  eyes, on whose countenance a thousand anxious passions stood  expressed.  &quot;Before she died,&quot; continued Theodore, &quot;she bound a  writing about my arm under my garments, which told me I was the son of  the Count Falconara.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is most true,&quot; said Jerome; &quot;I am that wretched father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Again I enjoin thee silence,&quot; said Manfred:  &quot;proceed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I remained in slavery,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;until within these two years,  when attending on my master in his cruises, I was delivered by a  Christian vessel, which overpowered the pirate; and discovering myself  to the captain, he generously put me on shore in Sicily; but alas!  instead of finding a father, I learned that his estate, which was  situated on the coast, had, during his absence, been laid waste by the  Rover who had carried my mother and me into captivity:  that his  castle had been burnt to the ground, and that my father on his return  had sold what remained, and was retired into religion in the kingdom  of Naples, but where no man could inform me.  Destitute and  friendless, hopeless almost of attaining the transport of a parent&#x27;s  embrace, I took the first opportunity of setting sail for Naples, from  whence, within these six days, I wandered into this province, still  supporting myself by the labour of my hands; nor until yester-morn did  I believe that heaven had reserved any lot for me but peace of mind  and contented poverty.  This, my Lord, is Theodore&#x27;s story.  I am  blessed beyond my hope in finding a father; I am unfortunate beyond my  desert in having incurred your Highness&#x27;s displeasure.&quot;</p>
<p>He ceased.  A murmur of approbation gently arose from the audience.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not all,&quot; said Frederic; &quot;I am bound in honour to add what he  suppresses.  Though he is modest, I must be generous; he is one of the  bravest youths on Christian ground.  He is warm too; and from the  short knowledge I have of him, I will pledge myself for his veracity:   if what he reports of himself were not true, he would not utter it -  and for me, youth, I honour a frankness which becomes thy birth; but  now, and thou didst offend me:  yet the noble blood which flows in thy  veins, may well be allowed to boil out, when it has so recently traced  itself to its source.  Come, my Lord,&quot; (turning to Manfred), &quot;if I can  pardon him, surely you may; it is not the youth&#x27;s fault, if you took  him for a spectre.&quot;</p>
<p>This bitter taunt galled the soul of Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;If beings from another world,&quot; replied he haughtily, &quot;have power to  impress my mind with awe, it is more than living man can do; nor could  a stripling&#x27;s arm.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; interrupted Hippolita, &quot;your guest has occasion for repose:   shall we not leave him to his rest?&quot;  Saying this, and taking Manfred  by the hand, she took leave of Frederic, and led the company forth.</p>
<p>The Prince, not sorry to quit a conversation which recalled to mind  the discovery he had made of his most secret sensations, suffered  himself to be conducted to his own apartment, after permitting  Theodore, though under engagement to return to the castle on the  morrow (a condition the young man gladly accepted), to retire with his  father to the convent.  Matilda and Isabella were too much occupied  with their own reflections, and too little content with each other, to  wish for farther converse that night.  They separated each to her  chamber, with more expressions of ceremony and fewer of affection thou  had passed between them since their childhood.</p>
<p>If they parted with small cordiality, they did but meet with greater  impatience, as soon as the sun was risen.  Their minds were in a  situation that excluded sleep, and each recollected a thousand  questions which she wished she had put to the other overnight.   Matilda reflected that Isabella had been twice delivered by Theodore  in very critical situations, which she could not believe accidental.   His eyes, it was true, had been fixed on her in Frederic&#x27;s chamber;  but that might have been to disguise his passion for Isabella from the  fathers of both.  It were better to clear this up.  She wished to know  the truth, lest she should wrong her friend by entertaining a passion  for Isabella&#x27;s lover.  Thus jealousy prompted, and at the same time  borrowed an excuse from friendship to justify its curiosity.</p>
<p>Isabella, not less restless, had better foundation for her suspicions.   Both Theodore&#x27;s tongue and eyes had told her his heart was engaged; it  was true - yet, perhaps, Matilda might not correspond to his passion;  she had ever appeared insensible to love:  all her thoughts were set  on heaven.</p>
<p>&quot;Why did I dissuade her?&quot; said Isabella to herself; &quot;I am punished for  my generosity; but when did they meet? where?  It cannot be; I have  deceived myself; perhaps last night was the first time they ever  beheld each other; it must be some other object that has prepossessed  his affections - if it is, I am not so unhappy as I thought; if it is  not my friend Matilda - how!  Can I stoop to wish for the affection of  a man, who rudely and unnecessarily acquainted me with his  indifference? and that at the very moment in which common courtesy  demanded at least expressions of civility.  I will go to my dear  Matilda, who will confirm me in this becoming pride.  Man is false - I  will advise with her on taking the veil:  she will rejoice to find me  in this disposition; and I will acquaint her that I no longer oppose  her inclination for the cloister.&quot;</p>
<p>In this frame of mind, and determined to open her heart entirely to  Matilda, she went to that Princess&#x27;s chamber, whom she found already  dressed, and leaning pensively on her arm.  This attitude, so  correspondent to what she felt herself, revived Isabella&#x27;s suspicions,  and destroyed the confidence she had purposed to place in her friend.   They blushed at meeting, and were too much novices to disguise their  sensations with address.  After some unmeaning questions and replies,  Matilda demanded of Isabella the cause of her flight?  The latter, who  had almost forgotten Manfred&#x27;s passion, so entirely was she occupied  by her own, concluding that Matilda referred to her last escape from  the convent, which had occasioned the events of the preceding evening,  replied -</p>
<p>&quot;Martelli brought word to the convent that your mother was dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Matilda, interrupting her, &quot;Bianca has explained that  mistake to me:  on seeing me faint, she cried out, &#x27;The Princess is  dead!&#x27; and Martelli, who had come for the usual dole to the castle - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what made you faint?&quot; said Isabella, indifferent to the rest.   Matilda blushed and stammered -</p>
<p>&quot;My father - he was sitting in judgment on a criminal - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What criminal?&quot; said Isabella eagerly.</p>
<p>&quot;A young man,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;I believe - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it was that young man that - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, Theodore?&quot; said Isabella.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered she; &quot;I never saw him before; I do not know how he had  offended my father, but as he has been of service to you, I am glad my  Lord has pardoned him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Served me!&quot; replied Isabella; &quot;do you term it serving me, to wound my  father, and almost occasion his death?  Though it is but since  yesterday that I am blessed with knowing a parent, I hope Matilda does  not think I am such a stranger to filial tenderness as not to resent  the boldness of that audacious youth, and that it is impossible for me  ever to feel any affection for one who dared to lift his arm against  the author of my being.  No, Matilda, my heart abhors him; and if you  still retain the friendship for me that you have vowed from your  infancy, you will detest a man who has been on the point of making me  miserable for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>Matilda held down her head and replied:  &quot;I hope my dearest Isabella  does not doubt her Matilda&#x27;s friendship:  I never beheld that youth  until yesterday; he is almost a stranger to me:  but as the surgeons  have pronounced your father out of danger, you ought not to harbour  uncharitable resentment against one, who I am persuaded did not know  the Marquis was related to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You plead his cause very pathetically,&quot; said Isabella, &quot;considering  he is so much a stranger to you!  I am mistaken, or he returns your  charity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What mean you?&quot; said Matilda.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; said Isabella, repenting that she had given Matilda a hint  of Theodore&#x27;s inclination for her.  Then changing the discourse, she  asked Matilda what occasioned Manfred to take Theodore for a spectre?</p>
<p>&quot;Bless me,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;did not you observe his extreme resemblance  to the portrait of Alfonso in the gallery?  I took notice of it to  Bianca even before I saw him in armour; but with the helmet on, he is  the very image of that picture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not much observe pictures,&quot; said Isabella:  &quot;much less have I  examined this young man so attentively as you seem to have done.  Ah?   Matilda, your heart is in danger, but let me warn you as a friend, he  has owned to me that he is in love; it cannot be with you, for  yesterday was the first time you ever met - was it not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; replied Matilda; &quot;but why does my dearest Isabella  conclude from anything I have said, that&quot; - she paused - then  continuing:  &quot;he saw you first, and I am far from having the vanity to  think that my little portion of charms could engage a heart devoted to  you; may you be happy, Isabella, whatever is the fate of Matilda!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My lovely friend,&quot; said Isabella, whose heart was too honest to  resist a kind expression, &quot;it is you that Theodore admires; I saw it;  I am persuaded of it; nor shall a thought of my own happiness suffer  me to interfere with yours.&quot;</p>
<p>This frankness drew tears from the gentle Matilda; and jealousy that  for a moment had raised a coolness between these amiable maidens soon  gave way to the natural sincerity and candour of their souls.  Each  confessed to the other the impression that Theodore had made on her;  and this confidence was followed by a struggle of generosity, each  insisting on yielding her claim to her friend.  At length the dignity  of Isabella&#x27;s virtue reminding her of the preference which Theodore  had almost declared for her rival, made her determine to conquer her  passion, and cede the beloved object to her friend.</p>
<p>During this contest of amity, Hippolita entered her daughter&#x27;s  chamber.</p>
<p>&quot;Madam,&quot; said she to Isabella, &quot;you have so much tenderness for  Matilda, and interest yourself so kindly in whatever affects our  wretched house, that I can have no secrets with my child which are not  proper for you to hear.&quot;</p>
<p>The princesses were all attention and anxiety.</p>
<p>&quot;Know then, Madam,&quot; continued Hippolita, &quot;and you my dearest Matilda,  that being convinced by all the events of these two last ominous days,  that heaven purposes the sceptre of Otranto should pass from Manfred&#x27;s  hands into those of the Marquis Frederic, I have been perhaps inspired  with the thought of averting our total destruction by the union of our  rival houses.  With this view I have been proposing to Manfred, my  lord, to tender this dear, dear child to Frederic, your father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me to Lord Frederic!&quot; cried Matilda; &quot;good heavens! my gracious  mother - and have you named it to my father?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have,&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;he listened benignly to my proposal, and is  gone to break it to the Marquis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! wretched princess!&quot; cried Isabella; &quot;what hast thou done! what  ruin has thy inadvertent goodness been preparing for thyself, for me,  and for Matilda!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ruin from me to you and to my child!&quot; said Hippolita &quot;what can this  mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas!&quot; said Isabella, &quot;the purity of your own heart prevents your  seeing the depravity of others.  Manfred, your lord, that impious man  - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hold,&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;you must not in my presence, young lady,  mention Manfred with disrespect:  he is my lord and husband, and - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will not long be so,&quot; said Isabella, &quot;if his wicked purposes can be  carried into execution.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This language amazes me,&quot; said Hippolita.  &quot;Your feeling, Isabella,  is warm; but until this hour I never knew it betray you into  intemperance.  What deed of Manfred authorises you to treat him as a  murderer, an assassin?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou virtuous, and too credulous Princess!&quot; replied Isabella; &quot;it is  not thy life he aims at - it is to separate himself from thee! to  divorce thee! to - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To divorce me!&quot;  &quot;To divorce my mother!&quot; cried Hippolita and Matilda  at once.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Isabella; &quot;and to complete his crime, he meditates - I  cannot speak it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What can surpass what thou hast already uttered?&quot; said Matilda.</p>
<p>Hippolita was silent.  Grief choked her speech; and the recollection  of Manfred&#x27;s late ambiguous discourses confirmed what she heard.</p>
<p>&quot;Excellent, dear lady! madam! mother!&quot; cried Isabella, flinging  herself at Hippolita&#x27;s feet in a transport of passion; &quot;trust me,  believe me, I will die a thousand deaths sooner than consent to injure  you, than yield to so odious - oh! - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is too much!&quot; cried Hippolita:  &quot;What crimes does one crime  suggest!  Rise, dear Isabella; I do not doubt your virtue.  Oh!  Matilda, this stroke is too heavy for thee! weep not, my child; and  not a murmur, I charge thee.  Remember, he is thy father still!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you are my mother too,&quot; said Matilda fervently; &quot;and you are  virtuous, you are guiltless! - Oh! must not I, must not I complain?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You must not,&quot; said Hippolita - &quot;come, all will yet be well.   Manfred, in the agony for the loss of thy brother, knew not what he  said; perhaps Isabella misunderstood him; his heart is good - and, my  child, thou knowest not all!  There is a destiny hangs over us; the  hand of Providence is stretched out; oh! could I but save thee from  the wreck!  Yes,&quot; continued she in a firmer tone, &quot;perhaps the  sacrifice of myself may atone for all; I will go and offer myself to  this divorce - it boots not what becomes of me.  I will withdraw into  the neighbouring monastery, and waste the remainder of life in prayers  and tears for my child and - the Prince!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art as much too good for this world,&quot; said Isabella, &quot;as Manfred  is execrable; but think not, lady, that thy weakness shall determine  for me.  I swear, hear me all ye angels - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop, I adjure thee,&quot; cried Hippolita:  &quot;remember thou dost not  depend on thyself; thou hast a father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My father is too pious, too noble,&quot; interrupted Isabella, &quot;to command  an impious deed.  But should he command it; can a father enjoin a  cursed act?  I was contracted to the son, can I wed the father?  No,  madam, no; force should not drag me to Manfred&#x27;s hated bed.  I loathe  him, I abhor him:  divine and human laws forbid - and my friend, my  dearest Matilda! would I wound her tender soul by injuring her adored  mother? my own mother - I never have known another&quot; -</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! she is the mother of both!&quot; cried Matilda:  &quot;can we, can we,  Isabella, adore her too much?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My lovely children,&quot; said the touched Hippolita, &quot;your tenderness  overpowers me - but I must not give way to it.  It is not ours to make  election for ourselves:  heaven, our fathers, and our husbands must  decide for us.  Have patience until you hear what Manfred and Frederic  have determined.  If the Marquis accepts Matilda&#x27;s hand, I know she  will readily obey.  Heaven may interpose and prevent the rest.  What  means my child?&quot; continued she, seeing Matilda fall at her feet with a  flood of speechless tears - &quot;But no; answer me not, my daughter:  I  must not hear a word against the pleasure of thy father.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! doubt not my obedience, my dreadful obedience to him and to you!&quot;  said Matilda.  &quot;But can I, most respected of women, can I experience  all this tenderness, this world of goodness, and conceal a thought  from the best of mothers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What art thou going to utter?&quot; said Isabella trembling.  &quot;Recollect  thyself, Matilda.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Isabella,&quot; said the Princess, &quot;I should not deserve this  incomparable parent, if the inmost recesses of my soul harboured a  thought without her permission - nay, I have offended her; I have  suffered a passion to enter my heart without her avowal - but here I  disclaim it; here I vow to heaven and her - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My child! my child;&quot; said Hippolita, &quot;what words are these! what new  calamities has fate in store for us!  Thou, a passion?  Thou, in this  hour of destruction - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! I see all my guilt!&quot; said Matilda.  &quot;I abhor myself, if I cost my  mother a pang.  She is the dearest thing I have on earth - Oh! I will  never, never behold him more!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isabella,&quot; said Hippolita, &quot;thou art conscious to this unhappy  secret, whatever it is.  Speak!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; cried Matilda, &quot;have I so forfeited my mother&#x27;s love, that she  will not permit me even to speak my own guilt? oh! wretched, wretched  Matilda!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art too cruel,&quot; said Isabella to Hippolita:  &quot;canst thou behold  this anguish of a virtuous mind, and not commiserate it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not pity my child!&quot; said Hippolita, catching Matilda in her arms -  &quot;Oh! I know she is good, she is all virtue, all tenderness, and duty.   I do forgive thee, my excellent, my only hope!&quot;</p>
<p>The princesses then revealed to Hippolita their mutual inclination for  Theodore, and the purpose of Isabella to resign him to Matilda.   Hippolita blamed their imprudence, and showed them the improbability  that either father would consent to bestow his heiress on so poor a  man, though nobly born.  Some comfort it gave her to find their  passion of so recent a date, and that Theodore had had but little  cause to suspect it in either.  She strictly enjoined them to avoid  all correspondence with him.  This Matilda fervently promised:  but  Isabella, who flattered herself that she meant no more than to promote  his union with her friend, could not determine to avoid him; and made  no reply.</p>
<p>&quot;I will go to the convent,&quot; said Hippolita, &quot;and order new masses to  be said for a deliverance from these calamities.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! my mother,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;you mean to quit us:  you mean to take  sanctuary, and to give my father an opportunity of pursuing his fatal  intention.  Alas! on my knees I supplicate you to forbear; will you  leave me a prey to Frederic?  I will follow you to the convent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be at peace, my child,&quot; said Hippolita:  &quot;I will return instantly.  I  will never abandon thee, until I know it is the will of heaven, and  for thy benefit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do not deceive me,&quot; said Matilda.  &quot;I will not marry Frederic until  thou commandest it.  Alas! what will become of me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why that exclamation?&quot; said Hippolita.  &quot;I have promised thee to  return - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! my mother,&quot; replied Matilda, &quot;stay and save me from myself.  A  frown from thee can do more than all my father&#x27;s severity.  I have  given away my heart, and you alone can make me recall it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No more,&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;thou must not relapse, Matilda.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can quit Theodore,&quot; said she, &quot;but must I wed another? let me  attend thee to the altar, and shut myself from the world for ever.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thy fate depends on thy father,&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;I have ill-bestowed  my tenderness, if it has taught thee to revere aught beyond him.   Adieu! my child:  I go to pray for thee.&quot;</p>
<p>Hippolita&#x27;s real purpose was to demand of Jerome, whether in  conscience she might not consent to the divorce.  She had oft urged  Manfred to resign the principality, which the delicacy of her  conscience rendered an hourly burthen to her.  These scruples  concurred to make the separation from her husband appear less dreadful  to her than it would have seemed in any other situation.</p>
<p>Jerome, at quitting the castle overnight, had questioned Theodore  severely why he had accused him to Manfred of being privy to his  escape.  Theodore owned it had been with design to prevent Manfred&#x27;s  suspicion from alighting on Matilda; and added, the holiness of  Jerome&#x27;s life and character secured him from the tyrant&#x27;s wrath.   Jerome was heartily grieved to discover his son&#x27;s inclination for that  princess; and leaving him to his rest, promised in the morning to  acquaint him with important reasons for conquering his passion.</p>
<p>Theodore, like Isabella, was too recently acquainted with parental  authority to submit to its decisions against the impulse of his heart.   He had little curiosity to learn the Friar&#x27;s reasons, and less  disposition to obey them.  The lovely Matilda had made stronger  impressions on him than filial affection.  All night he pleased  himself with visions of love; and it was not till late after the  morning-office, that he recollected the Friar&#x27;s commands to attend him  at Alfonso&#x27;s tomb.</p>
<p>&quot;Young man,&quot; said Jerome, when he saw him, &quot;this tardiness does not  please me.  Have a father&#x27;s commands already so little weight?&quot;</p>
<p>Theodore made awkward excuses, and attributed his delay to having  overslept himself.</p>
<p>&quot;And on whom were thy dreams employed?&quot; said the Friar sternly.  His  son blushed.  &quot;Come, come,&quot; resumed the Friar, &quot;inconsiderate youth,  this must not be; eradicate this guilty passion from thy breast - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guilty passion!&quot; cried Theodore:  &quot;Can guilt dwell with innocent  beauty and virtuous modesty?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is sinful,&quot; replied the Friar, &quot;to cherish those whom heaven has  doomed to destruction.  A tyrant&#x27;s race must be swept from the earth  to the third and fourth generation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will heaven visit the innocent for the crimes of the guilty?&quot; said  Theodore.  &quot;The fair Matilda has virtues enough - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To undo thee:&quot; interrupted Jerome.  &quot;Hast thou so soon forgotten that  twice the savage Manfred has pronounced thy sentence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor have I forgotten, sir,&quot; said Theodore, &quot;that the charity of his  daughter delivered me from his power.  I can forget injuries, but  never benefits.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The injuries thou hast received from Manfred&#x27;s race,&quot; said the Friar,  &quot;are beyond what thou canst conceive.  Reply not, but view this holy  image!  Beneath this marble monument rest the ashes of the good  Alfonso; a prince adorned with every virtue:  the father of his  people! the delight of mankind!  Kneel, headstrong boy, and list,  while a father unfolds a tale of horror that will expel every  sentiment from thy soul, but sensations of sacred vengeance - Alfonso!  much injured prince! let thy unsatisfied shade sit awful on the  troubled air, while these trembling lips - Ha! who comes there? - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The most wretched of women!&quot; said Hippolita, entering the choir.   &quot;Good Father, art thou at leisure? - but why this kneeling youth? what  means the horror imprinted on each countenance? why at this venerable  tomb - alas! hast thou seen aught?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We were pouring forth our orisons to heaven,&quot; replied the Friar, with  some confusion, &quot;to put an end to the woes of this deplorable  province.  Join with us, Lady! thy spotless soul may obtain an  exemption from the judgments which the portents of these days but too  speakingly denounce against thy house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I pray fervently to heaven to divert them,&quot; said the pious Princess.   &quot;Thou knowest it has been the occupation of my life to wrest a  blessing for my Lord and my harmless children. - One alas! is taken  from me! would heaven but hear me for my poor Matilda!  Father!  intercede for her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Every heart will bless her,&quot; cried Theodore with rapture.</p>
<p>&quot;Be dumb, rash youth!&quot; said Jerome.  &quot;And thou, fond Princess, contend  not with the Powers above! the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away:   bless His holy name, and submit to his decrees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do most devoutly,&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;but will He not spare my only  comfort? must Matilda perish too? - ah!  Father, I came - but dismiss  thy son.  No ear but thine must hear what I have to utter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May heaven grant thy every wish, most excellent Princess!&quot; said  Theodore retiring.  Jerome frowned.</p>
<p>Hippolita then acquainted the Friar with the proposal she had  suggested to Manfred, his approbation of it, and the tender of Matilda  that he was gone to make to Frederic.  Jerome could not conceal his  dislike of the notion, which he covered under pretence of the  improbability that Frederic, the nearest of blood to Alfonso, and who  was come to claim his succession, would yield to an alliance with the  usurper of his right.  But nothing could equal the perplexity of the  Friar, when Hippolita confessed her readiness not to oppose the  separation, and demanded his opinion on the legality of her  acquiescence.  The Friar caught eagerly at her request of his advice,  and without explaining his aversion to the proposed marriage of  Manfred and Isabella, he painted to Hippolita in the most alarming  colours the sinfulness of her consent, denounced judgments against her  if she complied, and enjoined her in the severest terms to treat any  such proposition with every mark of indignation and refusal.</p>
<p>Manfred, in the meantime, had broken his purpose to Frederic, and  proposed the double marriage.  That weak Prince, who had been struck  with the charms of Matilda, listened but too eagerly to the offer.  He  forgot his enmity to Manfred, whom he saw but little hope of  dispossessing by force; and flattering himself that no issue might  succeed from the union of his daughter with the tyrant, he looked upon  his own succession to the principality as facilitated by wedding  Matilda.  He made faint opposition to the proposal; affecting, for  form only, not to acquiesce unless Hippolita should consent to the  divorce.  Manfred took that upon himself.</p>
<p>Transported with his success, and impatient to see himself in a  situation to expect sons, he hastened to his wife&#x27;s apartment,  determined to extort her compliance.  He learned with indignation that  she was absent at the convent.  His guilt suggested to him that she  had probably been informed by Isabella of his purpose.  He doubted  whether her retirement to the convent did not import an intention of  remaining there, until she could raise obstacles to their divorce; and  the suspicions he had already entertained of Jerome, made him  apprehend that the Friar would not only traverse his views, but might  have inspired Hippolita with the resolution of talking sanctuary.   Impatient to unravel this clue, and to defeat its success, Manfred  hastened to the convent, and arrived there as the Friar was earnestly  exhorting the Princess never to yield to the divorce.</p>
<p>&quot;Madam,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;what business drew you hither? why did you not  await my return from the Marquis?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I came to implore a blessing on your councils,&quot; replied Hippolita.</p>
<p>&quot;My councils do not need a Friar&#x27;s intervention,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;and  of all men living is that hoary traitor the only one whom you delight  to confer with?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Profane Prince!&quot; said Jerome; &quot;is it at the altar that thou choosest  to insult the servants of the altar? - but, Manfred, thy impious  schemes are known.  Heaven and this virtuous lady know them - nay,  frown not, Prince.  The Church despises thy menaces.  Her thunders  will be heard above thy wrath.  Dare to proceed in thy cursed purpose  of a divorce, until her sentence be known, and here I lance her  anathema at thy head.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Audacious rebel!&quot; said Manfred, endeavouring to conceal the awe with  which the Friar&#x27;s words inspired him.  &quot;Dost thou presume to threaten  thy lawful Prince?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art no lawful Prince,&quot; said Jerome; &quot;thou art no Prince - go,  discuss thy claim with Frederic; and when that is done - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is done,&quot; replied Manfred; &quot;Frederic accepts Matilda&#x27;s hand, and  is content to waive his claim, unless I have no male issue&quot; - as he  spoke those words three drops of blood fell from the nose of Alfonso&#x27;s  statue.  Manfred turned pale, and the Princess sank on her knees.</p>
<p>&quot;Behold!&quot; said the Friar; &quot;mark this miraculous indication that the  blood of Alfonso will never mix with that of Manfred!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My gracious Lord,&quot; said Hippolita, &quot;let us submit ourselves to  heaven.  Think not thy ever obedient wife rebels against thy  authority.  I have no will but that of my Lord and the Church.  To  that revered tribunal let us appeal.  It does not depend on us to  burst the bonds that unite us.  If the Church shall approve the  dissolution of our marriage, be it so - I have but few years, and  those of sorrow, to pass.  Where can they be worn away so well as at  the foot of this altar, in prayers for thine and Matilda&#x27;s safety?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But thou shalt not remain here until then,&quot; said Manfred.  &quot;Repair  with me to the castle, and there I will advise on the proper measures  for a divorce; - but this meddling Friar comes not thither; my  hospitable roof shall never more harbour a traitor - and for thy  Reverence&#x27;s off-spring,&quot; continued he, &quot;I banish him from my  dominions.  He, I ween, is no sacred personage, nor under the  protection of the Church.  Whoever weds Isabella, it shall not be  Father Falconara&#x27;s started-up son.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They start up,&quot; said the Friar, &quot;who are suddenly beheld in the seat  of lawful Princes; but they wither away like the grass, and their  place knows them no more.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, casting a look of scorn at the Friar, led Hippolita forth;  but at the door of the church whispered one of his attendants to  remain concealed about the convent, and bring him instant notice, if  any one from the castle should repair thither.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>EVERY reflection which Manfred made on the Friar&#x27;s behaviour,  conspired to persuade him that Jerome was privy to an amour between  Isabella and Theodore.  But Jerome&#x27;s new presumption, so dissonant  from his former meekness, suggested still deeper apprehensions.  The  Prince even suspected that the Friar depended on some secret support  from Frederic, whose arrival, coinciding with the novel appearance of  Theodore, seemed to bespeak a correspondence.  Still more was he  troubled with the resemblance of Theodore to Alfonso&#x27;s portrait.  The  latter he knew had unquestionably died without issue.  Frederic had  consented to bestow Isabella on him.  These contradictions agitated  his mind with numberless pangs.</p>
<p>He saw but two methods of extricating himself from his difficulties.   The one was to resign his dominions to the Marquis - pride, ambition,  and his reliance on ancient prophecies, which had pointed out a  possibility of his preserving them to his posterity, combated that  thought.  The other was to press his marriage with Isabella.  After  long ruminating on these anxious thoughts, as he marched silently with  Hippolita to the castle, he at last discoursed with that Princess on  the subject of his disquiet, and used every insinuating and plausible  argument to extract her consent to, even her promise of promoting the  divorce.  Hippolita needed little persuasions to bend her to his  pleasure.  She endeavoured to win him over to the measure of resigning  his dominions; but finding her exhortations fruitless, she assured  him, that as far as her conscience would allow, she would raise no  opposition to a separation, though without better founded scruples  than what he yet alleged, she would not engage to be active in  demanding it.</p>
<p>This compliance, though inadequate, was sufficient to raise Manfred&#x27;s  hopes.  He trusted that his power and wealth would easily advance his  suit at the court of Rome, whither he resolved to engage Frederic to  take a journey on purpose.  That Prince had discovered so much passion  for Matilda, that Manfred hoped to obtain all he wished by holding out  or withdrawing his daughter&#x27;s charms, according as the Marquis should  appear more or less disposed to co-operate in his views.  Even the  absence of Frederic would be a material point gained, until he could  take further measures for his security.</p>
<p>Dismissing Hippolita to her apartment, he repaired to that of the  Marquis; but crossing the great hall through which he was to pass he  met Bianca.  The damsel he knew was in the confidence of both the  young ladies.  It immediately occurred to him to sift her on the  subject of Isabella and Theodore.  Calling her aside into the recess  of the oriel window of the hall, and soothing her with many fair words  and promises, he demanded of her whether she knew aught of the state  of Isabella&#x27;s affections.</p>
<p>&quot;I! my Lord! no my Lord - yes my Lord - poor Lady! she is wonderfully  alarmed about her father&#x27;s wounds; but I tell her he will do well;  don&#x27;t your Highness think so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do not ask you,&quot; replied Manfred, &quot;what she thinks about her  father; but you are in her secrets.  Come, be a good girl and tell me;  is there any young man - ha! - you understand me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord bless me! understand your Highness? no, not I.  I told her a few  vulnerary herbs and repose - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am not talking,&quot; replied the Prince, impatiently, &quot;about her  father; I know he will do well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bless me, I rejoice to hear your Highness say so; for though I  thought it not right to let my young Lady despond, methought his  greatness had a wan look, and a something - I remember when young  Ferdinand was wounded by the Venetian - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou answerest from the point,&quot; interrupted Manfred; &quot;but here, take  this jewel, perhaps that may fix thy attention - nay, no reverences;  my favour shall not stop here - come, tell me truly; how stands  Isabella&#x27;s heart?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well! your Highness has such a way!&quot; said Bianca, &quot;to be sure - but  can your Highness keep a secret? if it should ever come out of your  lips - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It shall not, it shall not,&quot; cried Manfred.</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, but swear, your Highness.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By my halidame, if it should ever be known that I said it - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, truth is truth, I do not think my Lady Isabella ever much  affectioned my young Lord your son; yet he was a sweet youth as one  should see; I am sure, if I had been a Princess - but bless me!  I  must attend my Lady Matilda; she will marvel what is become of me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stay,&quot; cried Manfred; &quot;thou hast not satisfied my question.  Hast  thou ever carried any message, any letter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I! good gracious!&quot; cried Bianca; &quot;I carry a letter?  I would not to  be a Queen.  I hope your Highness thinks, though I am poor, I am  honest.  Did your Highness never hear what Count Marsigli offered me,  when he came a wooing to my Lady Matilda?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have not leisure,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;to listen to thy tale.  I do not  question thy honesty.  But it is thy duty to conceal nothing from me.   How long has Isabella been acquainted with Theodore?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nay, there is nothing can escape your Highness!&quot; said Bianca; &quot;not  that I know any thing of the matter.  Theodore, to be sure, is a  proper young man, and, as my Lady Matilda says, the very image of good  Alfonso.  Has not your Highness remarked it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes, - No - thou torturest me,&quot; said Manfred.  &quot;Where did they  meet? when?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who! my Lady Matilda?&quot; said Bianca.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, not Matilda:  Isabella; when did Isabella first become  acquainted with this Theodore!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Virgin Mary!&quot; said Bianca, &quot;how should I know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou dost know,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;and I must know; I will - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord! your Highness is not jealous of young Theodore!&quot; said Bianca.</p>
<p>&quot;Jealous! no, no.  Why should I be jealous? perhaps I mean to unite  them - If I were sure Isabella would have no repugnance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Repugnance! no, I&#x27;ll warrant her,&quot; said Bianca; &quot;he is as comely a  youth as ever trod on Christian ground.  We are all in love with him;  there is not a soul in the castle but would be rejoiced to have him  for our Prince - I mean, when it shall please heaven to call your  Highness to itself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; said Manfred, &quot;has it gone so far! oh! this cursed Friar! -  but I must not lose time - go, Bianca, attend Isabella; but I charge  thee, not a word of what has passed.  Find out how she is affected  towards Theodore; bring me good news, and that ring has a companion.   Wait at the foot of the winding staircase:  I am going to visit the  Marquis, and will talk further with thee at my return.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, after some general conversation, desired Frederic to dismiss  the two Knights, his companions, having to talk with him on urgent  affairs.</p>
<p>As soon as they were alone, he began in artful guise to sound the  Marquis on the subject of Matilda; and finding him disposed to his  wish, he let drop hints on the difficulties that would attend the  celebration of their marriage, unless - At that instant Bianca burst  into the room with a wildness in her look and gestures that spoke the  utmost terror.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! my Lord, my Lord!&quot; cried she; &quot;we are all undone! it is come  again! it is come again!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is come again?&quot; cried Manfred amazed.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! the hand! the Giant! the hand! - support me! I am terrified out  of my senses,&quot; cried Bianca.  &quot;I will not sleep in the castle to- night.  Where shall I go? my things may come after me to-morrow -  would I had been content to wed Francesco! this comes of ambition!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What has terrified thee thus, young woman?&quot; said the Marquis.  &quot;Thou  art safe here; be not alarmed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! your Greatness is wonderfully good,&quot; said Bianca, &quot;but I dare not  - no, pray let me go - I had rather leave everything behind me, than  stay another hour under this roof.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go to, thou hast lost thy senses,&quot; said Manfred.  &quot;Interrupt us not;  we were communing on important matters - My Lord, this wench is  subject to fits - Come with me, Bianca.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! the Saints!  No,&quot; said Bianca, &quot;for certain it comes to warn your  Highness; why should it appear to me else?  I say my prayers morning  and evening - oh! if your Highness had believed Diego!  &#x27;Tis the same  hand that he saw the foot to in the gallery-chamber - Father Jerome  has often told us the prophecy would be out one of these days -  &#x27;Bianca,&#x27; said he, &#x27;mark my words - &#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou ravest,&quot; said Manfred, in a rage; &quot;be gone, and keep these  fooleries to frighten thy companions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What! my Lord,&quot; cried Bianca, &quot;do you think I have seen nothing? go  to the foot of the great stairs yourself - as I live I saw it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Saw what? tell us, fair maid, what thou hast seen,&quot; said Frederic.</p>
<p>&quot;Can your Highness listen,&quot; said Manfred, &quot;to the delirium of a silly  wench, who has heard stories of apparitions until she believes them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is more than fancy,&quot; said the Marquis; &quot;her terror is too  natural and too strongly impressed to be the work of imagination.   Tell us, fair maiden, what it is has moved thee thus?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my Lord, thank your Greatness,&quot; said Bianca; &quot;I believe I look  very pale; I shall be better when I have recovered myself - I was  going to my Lady Isabella&#x27;s chamber, by his Highness&#x27;s order - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We do not want the circumstances,&quot; interrupted Manfred.  &quot;Since his  Highness will have it so, proceed; but be brief.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord! your Highness thwarts one so!&quot; replied Bianca; &quot;I fear my hair  - I am sure I never in my life - well! as I was telling your  Greatness, I was going by his Highness&#x27;s order to my Lady Isabella&#x27;s  chamber; she lies in the watchet-coloured chamber, on the right hand,  one pair of stairs:  so when I came to the great stairs - I was  looking on his Highness&#x27;s present here - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Grant me patience! &quot; said Manfred, &quot;will this wench never come to the  point? what imports it to the Marquis, that I gave thee a bauble for  thy faithful attendance on my daughter? we want to know what thou  sawest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was going to tell your Highness,&quot; said Bianca, &quot;if you would permit  me.  So as I was rubbing the ring - I am sure I had not gone up three  steps, but I heard the rattling of armour; for all the world such a  clatter as Diego says he heard when the Giant turned him about in the  gallery-chamber.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What Giant is this, my Lord?&quot; said the Marquis; &quot;is your castle  haunted by giants and goblins?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lord! what, has not your Greatness heard the story of the Giant in  the gallery-chamber?&quot; cried Bianca.  &quot;I marvel his Highness has not  told you; mayhap you do not know there is a prophecy - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This trifling is intolerable,&quot; interrupted Manfred.  &quot;Let us dismiss  this silly wench, my Lord! we have more important affairs to discuss.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By your favour,&quot; said Frederic, &quot;these are no trifles.  The enormous  sabre I was directed to in the wood, yon casque, its fellow - are  these visions of this poor maiden&#x27;s brain?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So Jaquez thinks, may it please your Greatness,&quot; said Bianca.  &quot;He  says this moon will not be out without our seeing some strange  revolution.  For my part, I should not be surprised if it was to  happen to-morrow; for, as I was saying, when I heard the clattering of  armour, I was all in a cold sweat.  I looked up, and, if your  Greatness will believe me, I saw upon the uppermost banister of the  great stairs a hand in armour as big as big.  I thought I should have  swooned.  I never stopped until I came hither - would I were well out  of this castle.  My Lady Matilda told me but yester-morning that her  Highness Hippolita knows something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou art an insolent!&quot; cried Manfred.  &quot;Lord Marquis, it much  misgives me that this scene is concerted to affront me.  Are my own  domestics suborned to spread tales injurious to my honour?  Pursue  your claim by manly daring; or let us bury our feuds, as was proposed,  by the intermarriage of our children.  But trust me, it ill becomes a  Prince of your bearing to practise on mercenary wenches.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I scorn your imputation,&quot; said Frederic.  &quot;Until this hour I never  set eyes on this damsel:  I have given her no jewel.  My Lord, my  Lord, your conscience, your guilt accuses you, and would throw the  suspicion on me; but keep your daughter, and think no more of  Isabella.  The judgments already fallen on your house forbid me  matching into it.&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, alarmed at the resolute tone in which Frederic delivered  these words, endeavoured to pacify him.  Dismissing Bianca, he made  such submissions to the Marquis, and threw in such artful encomiums on  Matilda, that Frederic was once more staggered.  However, as his  passion was of so recent a date, it could not at once surmount the  scruples he had conceived.  He had gathered enough from Bianca&#x27;s  discourse to persuade him that heaven declared itself against Manfred.   The proposed marriages too removed his claim to a distance; and the  principality of Otranto was a stronger temptation than the contingent  reversion of it with Matilda.  Still he would not absolutely recede  from his engagements; but purposing to gain time, he demanded of  Manfred if it was true in fact that Hippolita consented to the  divorce.  The Prince, transported to find no other obstacle, and  depending on his influence over his wife, assured the Marquis it was  so, and that he might satisfy himself of the truth from her own mouth.</p>
<p>As they were thus discoursing, word was brought that the banquet was  prepared.  Manfred conducted Frederic to the great hall, where they  were received by Hippolita and the young Princesses.  Manfred placed  the Marquis next to Matilda, and seated himself between his wife and  Isabella.  Hippolita comported herself with an easy gravity; but the  young ladies were silent and melancholy.  Manfred, who was determined  to pursue his point with the Marquis in the remainder of the evening,  pushed on the feast until it waxed late; affecting unrestrained  gaiety, and plying Frederic with repeated goblets of wine.  The  latter, more upon his guard than Manfred wished, declined his frequent  challenges, on pretence of his late loss of blood; while the Prince,  to raise his own disordered spirits, and to counterfeit unconcern,  indulged himself in plentiful draughts, though not to the intoxication  of his senses.</p>
<p>The evening being far advanced, the banquet concluded.  Manfred would  have withdrawn with Frederic; but the latter pleading weakness and  want of repose, retired to his chamber, gallantly telling the Prince  that his daughter should amuse his Highness until himself could attend  him.  Manfred accepted the party, and to the no small grief of  Isabella, accompanied her to her apartment.  Matilda waited on her  mother to enjoy the freshness of the evening on the ramparts of the  castle.</p>
<p>Soon as the company were dispersed their several ways, Frederic,  quitting his chamber, inquired if Hippolita was alone, and was told by  one of her attendants, who had not noticed her going forth, that at  that hour she generally withdrew to her oratory, where he probably  would find her.  The Marquis, during the repast, had beheld Matilda  with increase of passion.  He now wished to find Hippolita in the  disposition her Lord had promised.  The portents that had alarmed him  were forgotten in his desires.  Stealing softly and unobserved to the  apartment of Hippolita, he entered it with a resolution to encourage  her acquiescence to the divorce, having perceived that Manfred was  resolved to make the possession of Isabella an unalterable condition,  before he would grant Matilda to his wishes.</p>
<p>The Marquis was not surprised at the silence that reigned in the  Princess&#x27;s apartment.  Concluding her, as he had been advertised, in  her oratory, he passed on.  The door was ajar; the evening gloomy and  overcast.  Pushing open the door gently, he saw a person kneeling  before the altar.  As he approached nearer, it seemed not a woman, but  one in a long woollen weed, whose back was towards him.  The person  seemed absorbed in prayer.  The Marquis was about to return, when the  figure, rising, stood some moments fixed in meditation, without  regarding him.  The Marquis, expecting the holy person to come forth,  and meaning to excuse his uncivil interruption, said,</p>
<p>&quot;Reverend Father, I sought the Lady Hippolita.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hippolita!&quot; replied a hollow voice; &quot;camest thou to this castle to  seek Hippolita?&quot; and then the figure, turning slowly round, discovered  to Frederic the fleshless jaws and empty sockets of a skeleton, wrapt  in a hermit&#x27;s cowl.</p>
<p>&quot;Angels of grace protect me!&quot; cried Frederic, recoiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Deserve their protection!&quot; said the Spectre.  Frederic, falling on  his knees, adjured the phantom to take pity on him.</p>
<p>&quot;Dost thou not remember me?&quot; said the apparition.  &quot;Remember the wood  of Joppa!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Art thou that holy hermit?&quot; cried Frederic, trembling.  &quot;Can I do  aught for thy eternal peace?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wast thou delivered from bondage,&quot; said the spectre, &quot;to pursue  carnal delights?  Hast thou forgotten the buried sabre, and the behest  of Heaven engraven on it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have not, I have not,&quot; said Frederic; &quot;but say, blest spirit, what  is thy errand to me?  What remains to be done?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To forget Matilda!&quot; said the apparition; and vanished.</p>
<p>Frederic&#x27;s blood froze in his veins.  For some minutes he remained  motionless.  Then falling prostrate on his face before the altar, he  besought the intercession of every saint for pardon.  A flood of tears  succeeded to this transport; and the image of the beauteous Matilda  rushing in spite of him on his thoughts, he lay on the ground in a  conflict of penitence and passion.  Ere he could recover from this  agony of his spirits, the Princess Hippolita with a taper in her hand  entered the oratory alone.  Seeing a man without motion on the floor,  she gave a shriek, concluding him dead.  Her fright brought Frederic  to himself.  Rising suddenly, his face bedewed with tears, he would  have rushed from her presence; but Hippolita stopping him, conjured  him in the most plaintive accents to explain the cause of his  disorder, and by what strange chance she had found him there in that  posture.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, virtuous Princess!&quot; said the Marquis, penetrated with grief, and  stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;For the love of Heaven, my Lord,&quot; said Hippolita, &quot;disclose the cause  of this transport!  What mean these doleful sounds, this alarming  exclamation on my name?  What woes has heaven still in store for the  wretched Hippolita?  Yet silent!  By every pitying angel, I adjure  thee, noble Prince,&quot; continued she, falling at his feet, &quot;to disclose  the purport of what lies at thy heart.  I see thou feelest for me;  thou feelest the sharp pangs that thou inflictest - speak, for pity!   Does aught thou knowest concern my child?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot speak,&quot; cried Frederic, bursting from her.  &quot;Oh, Matilda!&quot;</p>
<p>Quitting the Princess thus abruptly, he hastened to his own apartment.   At the door of it he was accosted by Manfred, who flushed by wine and  love had come to seek him, and to propose to waste some hours of the  night in music and revelling.  Frederic, offended at an invitation so  dissonant from the mood of his soul, pushed him rudely aside, and  entering his chamber, flung the door intemperately against Manfred,  and bolted it inwards.  The haughty Prince, enraged at this  unaccountable behaviour, withdrew in a frame of mind capable of the  most fatal excesses.  As he crossed the court, he was met by the  domestic whom he had planted at the convent as a spy on Jerome and  Theodore.  This man, almost breathless with the haste he had made,  informed his Lord that Theodore, and some lady from the castle were,  at that instant, in private conference at the tomb of Alfonso in St.  Nicholas&#x27;s church.  He had dogged Theodore thither, but the gloominess  of the night had prevented his discovering who the woman was.</p>
<p>Manfred, whose spirits were inflamed, and whom Isabella had driven  from her on his urging his passion with too little reserve, did not  doubt but the inquietude she had expressed had been occasioned by her  impatience to meet Theodore.  Provoked by this conjecture, and enraged  at her father, he hastened secretly to the great church.  Gliding  softly between the aisles, and guided by an imperfect gleam of  moonshine that shone faintly through the illuminated windows, he stole  towards the tomb of Alfonso, to which he was directed by indistinct  whispers of the persons he sought.  The first sounds he could  distinguish were -</p>
<p>&quot;Does it, alas! depend on me?  Manfred will never permit our union.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, this shall prevent it!&quot; cried the tyrant, drawing his dagger, and  plunging it over her shoulder into the bosom of the person that spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, me, I am slain!&quot; cried Matilda, sinking.  &quot;Good heaven, receive  my soul!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Savage, inhuman monster, what hast thou done!&quot; cried Theodore,  rushing on him, and wrenching his dagger from him.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop, stop thy impious hand!&quot; cried Matilda; &quot;it is my father!&quot;</p>
<p>Manfred, waking as from a trance, beat his breast, twisted his hands  in his locks, and endeavoured to recover his dagger from Theodore to  despatch himself.  Theodore, scarce less distracted, and only  mastering the transports of his grief to assist Matilda, had now by  his cries drawn some of the monks to his aid.  While part of them  endeavoured, in concert with the afflicted Theodore, to stop the blood  of the dying Princess, the rest prevented Manfred from laying violent  hands on himself.</p>
<p>Matilda, resigning herself patiently to her fate, acknowledged with  looks of grateful love the zeal of Theodore.  Yet oft as her faintness  would permit her speech its way, she begged the assistants to comfort  her father.  Jerome, by this time, had learnt the fatal news, and  reached the church.  His looks seemed to reproach Theodore, but  turning to Manfred, he said,</p>
<p>&quot;Now, tyrant! behold the completion of woe fulfilled on thy impious  and devoted head!  The blood of Alfonso cried to heaven for vengeance;  and heaven has permitted its altar to be polluted by assassination,  that thou mightest shed thy own blood at the foot of that Prince&#x27;s  sepulchre!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cruel man!&quot; cried Matilda, &quot;to aggravate the woes of a parent; may  heaven bless my father, and forgive him as I do!  My Lord, my gracious  Sire, dost thou forgive thy child?  Indeed, I came not hither to meet  Theodore.  I found him praying at this tomb, whither my mother sent me  to intercede for thee, for her - dearest father, bless your child, and  say you forgive her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive thee!  Murderous monster!&quot; cried Manfred, &quot;can assassins  forgive?  I took thee for Isabella; but heaven directed my bloody hand  to the heart of my child.  Oh, Matilda! - I cannot utter it - canst  thou forgive the blindness of my rage?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can, I do; and may heaven confirm it!&quot; said Matilda; &quot;but while I  have life to ask it - oh! my mother! what will she feel?  Will you  comfort her, my Lord?  Will you not put her away?  Indeed she loves  you!  Oh, I am faint! bear me to the castle.  Can I live to have her  close my eyes?&quot;</p>
<p>Theodore and the monks besought her earnestly to suffer herself to be  borne into the convent; but her instances were so pressing to be  carried to the castle, that placing her on a litter, they conveyed her  thither as she requested.  Theodore, supporting her head with his arm,  and hanging over her in an agony of despairing love, still endeavoured  to inspire her with hopes of life.  Jerome, on the other side,  comforted her with discourses of heaven, and holding a crucifix before  her, which she bathed with innocent tears, prepared her for her  passage to immortality.  Manfred, plunged in the deepest affliction,  followed the litter in despair.</p>
<p>Ere they reached the castle, Hippolita, informed of the dreadful  catastrophe, had flown to meet her murdered child; but when she saw  the afflicted procession, the mightiness of her grief deprived her of  her senses, and she fell lifeless to the earth in a swoon.  Isabella  and Frederic, who attended her, were overwhelmed in almost equal  sorrow.  Matilda alone seemed insensible to her own situation:  every  thought was lost in tenderness for her mother.</p>
<p>Ordering the litter to stop, as soon as Hippolita was brought to  herself, she asked for her father.  He approached, unable to speak.   Matilda, seizing his hand and her mother&#x27;s, locked them in her own,  and then clasped them to her heart.  Manfred could not support this  act of pathetic piety.  He dashed himself on the ground, and cursed  the day he was born.  Isabella, apprehensive that these struggles of  passion were more than Matilda could support, took upon herself to  order Manfred to be borne to his apartment, while she caused Matilda  to be conveyed to the nearest chamber.  Hippolita, scarce more alive  than her daughter, was regardless of everything but her; but when the  tender Isabella&#x27;s care would have likewise removed her, while the  surgeons examined Matilda&#x27;s wound, she cried,</p>
<p>&quot;Remove me! never, never!  I lived but in her, and will expire with  her.&quot;</p>
<p>Matilda raised her eyes at her mother&#x27;s voice, but closed them again  without speaking.  Her sinking pulse and the damp coldness of her hand  soon dispelled all hopes of recovery.  Theodore followed the surgeons  into the outer chamber, and heard them pronounce the fatal sentence  with a transport equal to frenzy.</p>
<p>&quot;Since she cannot live mine,&quot; cried he, &quot;at least she shall be mine in  death!  Father!  Jerome! will you not join our hands?&quot; cried he to the  Friar, who, with the Marquis, had accompanied the surgeons.</p>
<p>&quot;What means thy distracted rashness?&quot; said Jerome.  &quot;Is this an hour  for marriage?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is, it is,&quot; cried Theodore.  &quot;Alas! there is no other!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Young man, thou art too unadvised,&quot; said Frederic.  &quot;Dost thou think  we are to listen to thy fond transports in this hour of fate?  What  pretensions hast thou to the Princess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those of a Prince,&quot; said Theodore; &quot;of the sovereign of Otranto.   This reverend man, my father, has informed me who I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou ravest,&quot; said the Marquis.  &quot;There is no Prince of Otranto but  myself, now Manfred, by murder, by sacrilegious murder, has forfeited  all pretensions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; said Jerome, assuming an air of command, &quot;he tells you  true.  It was not my purpose the secret should have been divulged so  soon, but fate presses onward to its work.  What his hot-headed  passion has revealed, my tongue confirms.  Know, Prince, that when  Alfonso set sail for the Holy Land - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is this a season for explanations?&quot; cried Theodore.  &quot;Father, come  and unite me to the Princess; she shall be mine!  In every other thing  I will dutifully obey you.  My life! my adored Matilda!&quot; continued  Theodore, rushing back into the inner chamber, &quot;will you not be mine?   Will you not bless your - &quot;</p>
<p>Isabella made signs to him to be silent, apprehending the Princess was  near her end.</p>
<p>&quot;What, is she dead?&quot; cried Theodore; &quot;is it possible!&quot;</p>
<p>The violence of his exclamations brought Matilda to herself.  Lifting  up her eyes, she looked round for her mother.</p>
<p>&quot;Life of my soul, I am here!&quot; cried Hippolita; &quot;think not I will quit  thee!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! you are too good,&quot; said Matilda.  &quot;But weep not for me, my  mother!  I am going where sorrow never dwells - Isabella, thou hast  loved me; wouldst thou not supply my fondness to this dear, dear  woman?  Indeed I am faint!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! my child! my child!&quot; said Hippolita in a flood of tears, &quot;can I  not withhold thee a moment?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It will not be,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;commend me to heaven - Where is my  father? forgive him, dearest mother - forgive him my death; it was an  error.  Oh!  I had forgotten - dearest mother, I vowed never to see  Theodore more - perhaps that has drawn down this calamity - but it was  not intentional - can you pardon me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! wound not my agonising soul!&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;thou never couldst  offend me - Alas! she faints! help! help!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would say something more,&quot; said Matilda, struggling, &quot;but it cannot  be - Isabella - Theodore - for my sake - Oh! - &quot; she expired.</p>
<p>Isabella and her women tore Hippolita from the corse; but Theodore  threatened destruction to all who attempted to remove him from it.  He  printed a thousand kisses on her clay-cold hands, and uttered every  expression that despairing love could dictate.</p>
<p>Isabella, in the meantime, was accompanying the afflicted Hippolita to  her apartment; but, in the middle of the court, they were met by  Manfred, who, distracted with his own thoughts, and anxious once more  to behold his daughter, was advancing to the chamber where she lay.   As the moon was now at its height, he read in the countenances of this  unhappy company the event he dreaded.</p>
<p>&quot;What! is she dead?&quot; cried he in wild confusion.  A clap of thunder at  that instant shook the castle to its foundations; the earth rocked,  and the clank of more than mortal armour was heard behind.  Frederic  and Jerome thought the last day was at hand.  The latter, forcing  Theodore along with them, rushed into the court.  The moment Theodore  appeared, the walls of the castle behind Manfred were thrown down with  a mighty force, and the form of Alfonso, dilated to an immense  magnitude, appeared in the centre of the ruins.</p>
<p>&quot;Behold in Theodore the true heir of Alfonso!&quot; said the vision:  And  having pronounced those words, accompanied by a clap of thunder, it  ascended solemnly towards heaven, where the clouds parting asunder,  the form of St. Nicholas was seen, and receiving Alfonso&#x27;s shade, they  were soon wrapt from mortal eyes in a blaze of glory.</p>
<p>The beholders fell prostrate on their faces, acknowledging the divine  will.  The first that broke silence was Hippolita.</p>
<p>&quot;My Lord,&quot; said she to the desponding Manfred, &quot;behold the vanity of  human greatness!  Conrad is gone!  Matilda is no more!  In Theodore we  view the true Prince of Otranto.  By what miracle he is so I know not  - suffice it to us, our doom is pronounced! shall we not, can we but  dedicate the few deplorable hours we have to live, in deprecating the  further wrath of heaven? heaven ejects us - whither can we fly, but to  yon holy cells that yet offer us a retreat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thou guiltless but unhappy woman! unhappy by my crimes!&quot; replied  Manfred, &quot;my heart at last is open to thy devout admonitions.  Oh!  could - but it cannot be - ye are lost in wonder - let me at last do  justice on myself!  To heap shame on my own head is all the  satisfaction I have left to offer to offended heaven.  My story has  drawn down these judgments:  Let my confession atone - but, ah! what  can atone for usurpation and a murdered child? a child murdered in a  consecrated place?  List, sirs, and may this bloody record be a  warning to future tyrants!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alfonso, ye all know, died in the Holy Land - ye would interrupt me;  ye would say he came not fairly to his end - it is most true - why  else this bitter cup which Manfred must drink to the dregs.  Ricardo,  my grandfather, was his chamberlain - I would draw a veil over my  ancestor&#x27;s crimes - but it is in vain!  Alfonso died by poison.  A  fictitious will declared Ricardo his heir.  His crimes pursued him -  yet he lost no Conrad, no Matilda!  I pay the price of usurpation for  all!  A storm overtook him.  Haunted by his guilt he vowed to St.  Nicholas to found a church and two convents, if he lived to reach  Otranto.  The sacrifice was accepted:  the saint appeared to him in a  dream, and promised that Ricardo&#x27;s posterity should reign in Otranto  until the rightful owner should be grown too large to inhabit the  castle, and as long as issue male from Ricardo&#x27;s loins should remain  to enjoy it - alas! alas! nor male nor female, except myself, remains  of all his wretched race!  I have done - the woes of these three days  speak the rest.  How this young man can be Alfonso&#x27;s heir I know not -  yet I do not doubt it.  His are these dominions; I resign them - yet I  knew not Alfonso had an heir - I question not the will of heaven -  poverty and prayer must fill up the woeful space, until Manfred shall  be summoned to Ricardo.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What remains is my part to declare,&quot; said Jerome.  &quot;When Alfonso set  sail for the Holy Land he was driven by a storm to the coast of  Sicily.  The other vessel, which bore Ricardo and his train, as your  Lordship must have heard, was separated from him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is most true,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;and the title you give me is more  than an outcast can claim - well! be it so - proceed.&quot;</p>
<p>Jerome blushed, and continued.  &quot;For three months Lord Alfonso was  wind-bound in Sicily.  There he became enamoured of a fair virgin  named Victoria.  He was too pious to tempt her to forbidden pleasures.   They were married.  Yet deeming this amour incongruous with the holy  vow of arms by which he was bound, he determined to conceal their  nuptials until his return from the Crusade, when he purposed to seek  and acknowledge her for his lawful wife.  He left her pregnant.   During his absence she was delivered of a daughter.  But scarce had  she felt a mother&#x27;s pangs ere she heard the fatal rumour of her Lord&#x27;s  death, and the succession of Ricardo.  What could a friendless,  helpless woman do?  Would her testimony avail? - yet, my lord, I have  an authentic writing - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It needs not,&quot; said Manfred; &quot;the horrors of these days, the vision  we have but now seen, all corroborate thy evidence beyond a thousand  parchments.  Matilda&#x27;s death and my expulsion - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be composed, my Lord,&quot; said Hippolita; &quot;this holy man did not mean to  recall your griefs.&quot;  Jerome proceeded.</p>
<p>&quot;I shall not dwell on what is needless.  The daughter of which  Victoria was delivered, was at her maturity bestowed in marriage on  me.  Victoria died; and the secret remained locked in my breast.   Theodore&#x27;s narrative has told the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>The Friar ceased.  The disconsolate company retired to the remaining  part of the castle.  In the morning Manfred signed his abdication of  the principality, with the approbation of Hippolita, and each took on  them the habit of religion in the neighbouring convents.  Frederic  offered his daughter to the new Prince, which Hippolita&#x27;s tenderness  for Isabella concurred to promote.  But Theodore&#x27;s grief was too fresh  to admit the thought of another love; and it was not until after  frequent discourses with Isabella of his dear Matilda, that he was  persuaded he could know no happiness but in the society of one with  whom he could for ever indulge the melancholy that had taken  possession of his soul.</p>
