<p>I HAD done a few things and earned a few pence - I had perhaps even  had time to begin to think I was finer than was perceived by the  patronising; but when I take the little measure of my course (a  fidgety habit, for it&#x27;s none of the longest yet) I count my real  start from the evening George Corvick, breathless and worried, came  in to ask me a service.  He had done more things than I, and earned  more pence, though there were chances for cleverness I thought he  sometimes missed.  I could only however that evening declare to him  that he never missed one for kindness.  There was almost rapture in  hearing it proposed to me to prepare for THE MIDDLE, the organ of  our lucubrations, so called from the position in the week of its  day of appearance, an article for which he had made himself  responsible and of which, tied up with a stout string, he laid on  my table the subject.  I pounced upon my opportunity - that is on  the first volume of it - and paid scant attention to my friend&#x27;s  explanation of his appeal.  What explanation could be more to the  point than my obvious fitness for the task?  I had written on Hugh  Vereker, but never a word in THE MIDDLE, where my dealings were  mainly with the ladies and the minor poets.  This was his new  novel, an advance copy, and whatever much or little it should do  for his reputation I was clear on the spot as to what it should do  for mine.  Moreover if I always read him as soon as I could get  hold of him I had a particular reason for wishing to read him now:   I had accepted an invitation to Bridges for the following Sunday,  and it had been mentioned in Lady Jane&#x27;s note that Mr. Vereker was  to be there.  I was young enough for a flutter at meeting a man of  his renown, and innocent enough to believe the occasion would  demand the display of an acquaintance with his &quot;last.&quot;</p>
<p>Corvick, who had promised a review of it, had not even had time to  read it; he had gone to pieces in consequence of news requiring -  as on precipitate reflexion he judged - that he should catch the  night-mail to Paris.  He had had a telegram from Gwendolen Erme in  answer to his letter offering to fly to her aid.  I knew already  about Gwendolen Erme; I had never seen her, but I had my ideas,  which were mainly to the effect that Corvick would marry her if her  mother would only die.  That lady seemed now in a fair way to  oblige him; after some dreadful mistake about a climate or a &quot;cure&quot;  she had suddenly collapsed on the return from abroad.  Her  daughter, unsupported and alarmed, desiring to make a rush for home  but hesitating at the risk, had accepted our friend&#x27;s assistance,  and it was my secret belief that at sight of him Mrs. Erme would  pull round.  His own belief was scarcely to be called secret; it  discernibly at any rate differed from mine.  He had showed me  Gwendolen&#x27;s photograph with the remark that she wasn&#x27;t pretty but  was awfully interesting; she had published at the age of nineteen a  novel in three volumes, &quot;Deep Down,&quot; about which, in THE MIDDLE, he  had been really splendid.  He appreciated my present eagerness and  undertook that the periodical in question should do no less; then  at the last, with his hand on the door, he said to me:  &quot;Of course  you&#x27;ll be all right, you know.&quot;  Seeing I was a trifle vague he  added:  &quot;I mean you won&#x27;t be silly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Silly - about Vereker!  Why what do I ever find him but awfully  clever?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, what&#x27;s that but silly?  What on earth does &#x27;awfully clever&#x27;  mean?  For God&#x27;s sake try to get AT him.  Don&#x27;t let him suffer by  our arrangement.  Speak of him, you know, if you can, as I should  have spoken of him.&quot;</p>
<p>I wondered an instant.  &quot;You mean as far and away the biggest of  the lot - that sort of thing?&quot;</p>
<p>Corvick almost groaned.  &quot;Oh you know, I don&#x27;t put them back to  back that way; it&#x27;s the infancy of art!  But he gives me a pleasure  so rare; the sense of&quot; - he mused a little - &quot;something or other.&quot;</p>
<p>I wondered again.  &quot;The sense, pray, of want?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear man, that&#x27;s just what I want YOU to say!&quot;</p>
<p>Even before he had banged the door I had begun, book in hand, to  prepare myself to say it.  I sat up with Vereker half the night;  Corvick couldn&#x27;t have done more than that.  He was awfully clever -  I stuck to that, but he wasn&#x27;t a bit the biggest of the lot.  I  didn&#x27;t allude to the lot, however; I flattered myself that I  emerged on this occasion from the infancy of art.  &quot;It&#x27;s all  right,&quot; they declared vividly at the office; and when the number  appeared I felt there was a basis on which I could meet the great  man.  It gave me confidence for a day or two - then that confidence  dropped.  I had fancied him reading it with relish, but if Corvick  wasn&#x27;t satisfied how could Vereker himself be?  I reflected indeed  that the heat of the admirer was sometimes grosser even than the  appetite of the scribe.  Corvick at all events wrote me from Paris  a little ill-humouredly.  Mrs. Erme was pulling round, and I hadn&#x27;t  at all said what Vereker gave him the sense of.</p>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
<p>THE effect of my visit to Bridges was to turn me out for more  profundity.  Hugh Vereker, as I saw him there, was of a contact so  void of angles that I blushed for the poverty of imagination  involved in my small precautions.  If he was in spirits it wasn&#x27;t  because he had read my review; in fact on the Sunday morning I felt  sure he hadn&#x27;t read it, though THE MIDDLE had been out three days  and bloomed, I assured myself, in the stiff garden of periodicals  which gave one of the ormolu tables the air of a stand at a  station.  The impression he made on me personally was such that I  wished him to read it, and I corrected to this end with a  surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the careless  conspicuity of the sheet.  I&#x27;m afraid I even watched the result of  my manoeuvre, but up to luncheon I watched in vain.</p>
<p>When afterwards, in the course of our gregarious walk, I found  myself for half an hour, not perhaps without another manoeuvre, at  the great man&#x27;s side, the result of his affability was a still  livelier desire that he shouldn&#x27;t remain in ignorance of the  peculiar justice I had done him.  It wasn&#x27;t that he seemed to  thirst for justice; on the contrary I hadn&#x27;t yet caught in his talk  the faintest grunt of a grudge - a note for which my young  experience had already given me an ear.  Of late he had had more  recognition, and it was pleasant, as we used to say in THE MIDDLE,  to see how it drew him out.  He wasn&#x27;t of course popular, but I  judged one of the sources of his good humour to be precisely that  his success was independent of that.  He had none the less become  in a manner the fashion; the critics at least had put on a spurt  and caught up with him.  We had found out at last how clever he  was, and he had had to make the best of the loss of his mystery.  I  was strongly tempted, as I walked beside him, to let him know how  much of that unveiling was my act; and there was a moment when I  probably should have done so had not one of the ladies of our  party, snatching a place at his other elbow, just then appealed to  him in a spirit comparatively selfish.  It was very discouraging:   I almost felt the liberty had been taken with myself.</p>
<p>I had had on my tongue&#x27;s end, for my own part, a phrase or two  about the right word at the right time; but later on I was glad not  to have spoken, for when on our return we clustered at tea I  perceived Lady Jane, who had not been out with us, brandishing THE  MIDDLE with her longest arm.  She had taken it up at her leisure;  she was delighted with what she had found, and I saw that, as a  mistake in a man may often be a felicity in a woman, she would  practically do for me what I hadn&#x27;t been able to do for myself.   &quot;Some sweet little truths that needed to be spoken,&quot; I heard her  declare, thrusting the paper at rather a bewildered couple by the  fireplace.  She grabbed it away from them again on the reappearance  of Hugh Vereker, who after our walk had been upstairs to change  something.  &quot;I know you don&#x27;t in general look at this kind of  thing, but it&#x27;s an occasion really for doing so.  You HAVEN&#x27;T seen  it?  Then you must.  The man has actually got AT you, at what I  always feel, you know.&quot;  Lady Jane threw into her eyes a look  evidently intended to give an idea of what she always felt; but she  added that she couldn&#x27;t have expressed it.  The man in the paper  expressed it in a striking manner.  &quot;Just see there, and there,  where I&#x27;ve dashed it, how he brings it out.&quot;  She had literally  marked for him the brightest patches of my prose, and if I was a  little amused Vereker himself may well have been.  He showed how  much he was when before us all Lady Jane wanted to read something  aloud.  I liked at any rate the way he defeated her purpose by  jerking the paper affectionately out of her clutch.  He&#x27;d take it  upstairs with him and look at it on going to dress.  He did this  half an hour later - I saw it in his hand when he repaired to his  room.  That was the moment at which, thinking to give her pleasure,  I mentioned to Lady Jane that I was the author of the review.  I  did give her pleasure, I judged, but perhaps not quite so much as I  had expected.  If the author was &quot;only me&quot; the thing didn&#x27;t seem  quite so remarkable.  Hadn&#x27;t I had the effect rather of diminishing  the lustre of the article than of adding to my own?  Her ladyship  was subject to the most extraordinary drops.  It didn&#x27;t matter; the  only effect I cared about was the one it would have on Vereker up  there by his bedroom fire.</p>
<p>At dinner I watched for the signs of this impression, tried to  fancy some happier light in his eyes; but to my disappointment Lady  Jane gave me no chance to make sure.  I had hoped she&#x27;d call  triumphantly down the table, publicly demand if she hadn&#x27;t been  right.  The party was large - there were people from outside as  well, but I had never seen a table long enough to deprive Lady Jane  of a triumph.  I was just reflecting in truth that this  interminable board would deprive ME of one when the guest next me,  dear woman - she was Miss Poyle, the vicar&#x27;s sister, a robust  unmodulated person - had the happy inspiration and the unusual  courage to address herself across it to Vereker, who was opposite,  but not directly, so that when he replied they were both leaning  forward.  She enquired, artless body, what he thought of Lady  Jane&#x27;s &quot;panegyric,&quot; which she had read - not connecting it however  with her right-hand neighbour; and while I strained my ear for his  reply I heard him, to my stupefaction, call back gaily, his mouth  full of bread:  &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s all right - the usual twaddle!&quot;</p>
<p>I had caught Vereker&#x27;s glance as he spoke, but Miss Poyle&#x27;s  surprise was a fortunate cover for my own.  &quot;You mean he doesn&#x27;t do  you justice?&quot; said the excellent woman.</p>
<p>Vereker laughed out, and I was happy to be able to do the same.   &quot;It&#x27;s a charming article,&quot; he tossed us.</p>
<p>Miss Poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth.  &quot;Oh, you&#x27;re so  deep!&quot; she drove home.</p>
<p>&quot;As deep as the ocean!  All I pretend is that the author doesn&#x27;t  see - &quot;  But a dish was at this point passed over his shoulder, and  we had to wait while he helped himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Doesn&#x27;t see what?&quot; my neighbour continued.</p>
<p>&quot;Doesn&#x27;t see anything.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dear me - how very stupid!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not a bit,&quot; Vereker laughed main.  &quot;Nobody does.&quot;</p>
<p>The lady on his further side appealed to him, and Miss Poyle sank  back to myself.  &quot;Nobody sees anything!&quot; she cheerfully announced;  to which I replied that I had often thought so too, but had somehow  taken the thought for a proof on my own part of a tremendous eye.   I didn&#x27;t tell her the article was mine; and I observed that Lady  Jane, occupied at the end of the table, had not caught Vereker&#x27;s  words.</p>
<p>I rather avoided him after dinner, for I confess he struck me as  cruelly conceited, and the revelation was a pain.  &quot;The usual  twaddle&quot; - my acute little study!  That one&#x27;s admiration should  have had a reserve or two could gall him to that point!  I had  thought him placid, and he was placid enough; such a surface was  the hard polished glass that encased the bauble of his vanity.  I  was really ruffled, and the only comfort was that if nobody saw  anything George Corvick was quite as much out of it as I.  This  comfort however was not sufficient, after the ladies had dispersed,  to carry me in the proper manner - I mean in a spotted jacket and  humming an air - into the smoking-room.  I took my way in some  dejection to bed; but in the passage I encountered Mr. Vereker, who  had been up once more to change, coming out of his room.  HE was  humming an air and had on a spotted jacket, and as soon as he saw  me his gaiety gave a start.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear young man,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;I&#x27;m so glad to lay hands on  you!  I&#x27;m afraid I most unwittingly wounded you by those words of  mine at dinner to Miss Poyle.  I learned but half an hour ago from  Lady Jane that you&#x27;re the author of the little notice in THE  MIDDLE.&quot;</p>
<p>I protested that no bones were broken; but he moved with me to my  own door, his hand, on my shoulder, kindly feeling for a fracture;  and on hearing that I had come up to bed he asked leave to cross my  threshold and just tell me in three words what his qualification of  my remarks had represented.  It was plain he really feared I was  hurt, and the sense of his solicitude suddenly made all the  difference to me.  My cheap review fluttered off into space, and  the best things I had said in it became flat enough beside the  brilliancy of his being there.  I can see him there still, on my  rug, in the firelight and his spotted jacket, his fine clear face  all bright with the desire to be tender to my youth.  I don&#x27;t know  what he had at first meant to say, but I think the sight of my  relief touched him, excited him, brought up words to his lips from  far within.  It was so these words presently conveyed to me  something that, as I afterwards knew, he had never uttered to any  one.  I&#x27;ve always done justice to the generous impulse that made  him speak; it was simply compunction for a snub unconsciously  administered to a man of letters in a position inferior to his own,  a man of letters moreover in the very act of praising him.  To make  the thing right he talked to me exactly as an equal and on the  ground of what we both loved best.  The hour, the place, the  unexpectedness deepened the impression:  he couldn&#x27;t have done  anything more intensely effective.</p>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<p>&quot;I DON&#x27;T quite know how to explain it to you,&quot; he said, &quot;but it was  the very fact that your notice of my book had a spice of  intelligence, it was just your exceptional sharpness, that produced  the feeling - a very old story with me, I beg you to believe -  under the momentary influence of which I used in speaking to that  good lady the words you so naturally resent.  I don&#x27;t read the  things in the newspapers unless they&#x27;re thrust upon me as that one  was - it&#x27;s always one&#x27;s best friend who does it!  But I used to  read them sometimes - ten years ago.  I dare say they were in  general rather stupider then; at any rate it always struck me they  missed my little point with a perfection exactly as admirable when  they patted me on the back as when they kicked me in the shins.   Whenever since I&#x27;ve happened to have a glimpse of them they were  still blazing away - still missing it, I mean, deliciously.  YOU  miss it, my dear fellow, with inimitable assurance; the fact of  your being awfully clever and your article&#x27;s being awfully nice  doesn&#x27;t make a hair&#x27;s breadth of difference.  It&#x27;s quite with you  rising young men,&quot; Vereker laughed, &quot;that I feel most what a  failure I am!&quot;</p>
<p>I listened with keen interest; it grew keener as he talked.  &quot;YOU a  failure - heavens!  What then may your &#x27;little point&#x27; happen to  be?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have I got to TELL you, after all these years and labours?&quot;  There  was something in the friendly reproach of this - jocosely  exaggerated - that made me, as an ardent young seeker for truth,  blush to the roots of my hair.  I&#x27;m as much in the dark as ever,  though I&#x27;ve grown used in a sense to my obtuseness; at that moment,  however, Vereker&#x27;s happy accent made me appear to myself, and  probably to him, a rare dunce.  I was on the point of exclaiming  &quot;Ah yes, don&#x27;t tell me:  for my honour, for that of the craft,  don&#x27;t!&quot; when he went on in a manner that showed he had read my  thought and had his own idea of the probability of our some day  redeeming ourselves.  &quot;By my little point I mean - what shall I  call it? - the particular thing I&#x27;ve written my books most FOR.   Isn&#x27;t there for every writer a particular thing of that sort, the  thing that most makes him apply himself, the thing without the  effort to achieve which he wouldn&#x27;t write at all, the very passion  of his passion, the part of the business in which, for him, the  flame of art burns most intensely?  Well, it&#x27;s THAT!&quot;</p>
<p>I considered a moment - that is I followed at a respectful  distance, rather gasping.  I was fascinated - easily, you&#x27;ll say;  but I wasn&#x27;t going after all to be put off my guard.  &quot;Your  description&#x27;s certainly beautiful, but it doesn&#x27;t make what you  describe very distinct.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I promise you it would be distinct if it should dawn on you at  all.&quot;  I saw that the charm of our topic overflowed for my  companion into an emotion as lively as my own.  &quot;At any rate,&quot; he  went on, &quot;I can speak for myself:  there&#x27;s an idea in my work  without which I wouldn&#x27;t have given a straw for the whole job.   It&#x27;s the finest fullest intention of the lot, and the application  of it has been, I think, a triumph of patience, of ingenuity.  I  ought to leave that to somebody else to say; but that nobody does  say it is precisely what we&#x27;re talking about.  It stretches, this  little trick of mine, from book to book, and everything else,  comparatively, plays over the surface of it.  The order, the form,  the texture of my books will perhaps some day constitute for the  initiated a complete representation of it.  So it&#x27;s naturally the  thing for the critic to look for.  It strikes me,&quot; my visitor  added, smiling, &quot;even as the thing for the critic to find.&quot;</p>
<p>This seemed a responsibility indeed.  &quot;You call it a little trick?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s only my little modesty.  It&#x27;s really an exquisite scheme.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you hold that you&#x27;ve carried the scheme out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The way I&#x27;ve carried it out is the thing in life I think a bit  well of myself for.&quot;</p>
<p>I had a pause.  &quot;Don&#x27;t you think you ought - just a trifle - to  assist the critic?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Assist him?  What else have I done with every stroke of my pen?   I&#x27;ve shouted my intention in his great blank face!&quot;  At this,  laughing out again, Vereker laid his hand on my shoulder to show  the allusion wasn&#x27;t to my personal appearance.</p>
<p>&quot;But you talk about the initiated.  There must therefore, you see,  BE initiation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What else in heaven&#x27;s name is criticism supposed to be?&quot;  I&#x27;m  afraid I coloured at this too; but I took refuge in repeating that  his account of his silver lining was poor in something or other  that a plain man knows things by.  &quot;That&#x27;s only because you&#x27;ve  never had a glimpse of it,&quot; he returned.  &quot;If you had had one the  element in question would soon have become practically all you&#x27;d  see.  To me it&#x27;s exactly as palpable as the marble of this chimney.   Besides, the critic just ISN&#x27;T a plain man:  if he were, pray, what  would he be doing in his neighbour&#x27;s garden?  You&#x27;re anything but a  plain man yourself, and the very raison d&#x27;etre of you all is that  you&#x27;re little demons of subtlety.  If my great affair&#x27;s a secret,  that&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s a secret in spite of itself - the amazing  event has made it one.  I not only never took the smallest  precaution to keep it so, but never dreamed of any such accident.   If I had I shouldn&#x27;t in advance have had the heart to go on.  As it  was, I only became aware little by little, and meanwhile I had done  my work.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And now you quite like it?&quot; I risked.</p>
<p>&quot;My work?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your secret.  It&#x27;s the same thing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your guessing that,&quot; Vereker replied, &quot;is a proof that you&#x27;re as  clever as I say!&quot;  I was encouraged by this to remark that he would  clearly be pained to part with it, and he confessed that it was  indeed with him now the great amusement of life.  &quot;I live almost to  see if it will ever be detected.&quot;  He looked at me for a jesting  challenge; something far within his eyes seemed to peep out.  &quot;But  I needn&#x27;t worry - it won&#x27;t!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You fire me as I&#x27;ve never been fired,&quot; I declared; &quot;you make me  determined to do or die.&quot;  Then I asked:  &quot;Is it a kind of esoteric  message?&quot;</p>
<p>His countenance fell at this - he put out his hand as if to bid me  good-night.  &quot;Ah my dear fellow, it can&#x27;t be described in cheap  journalese!&quot;</p>
<p>I knew of course he&#x27;d be awfully fastidious, but our talk had made  me feel how much his nerves were exposed.  I was unsatisfied - I  kept hold of his hand.  &quot;I won&#x27;t make use of the expression then,&quot;  I said, &quot;in the article in which I shall eventually announce my  discovery, though I dare say I shall have hard work to do without  it.  But meanwhile, just to hasten that difficult birth, can&#x27;t you  give a fellow a clue?&quot;  I felt much more at my ease.</p>
<p>&quot;My whole lucid effort gives him the clue - every page and line and  letter.  The thing&#x27;s as concrete there as a bird in a cage, a bait  on a hook, a piece of cheese in a mouse-trap.  It&#x27;s stuck into  every volume as your foot is stuck into your shoe.  It governs  every line, it chooses every word, it dots every i, it places every  comma.&quot;</p>
<p>I scratched my head.  &quot;Is it something in the style or something in  the thought?  An element of form or an element of feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>He indulgently shook my hand again, and I felt my questions to be  crude and my distinctions pitiful.  &quot;Good-night, my dear boy -  don&#x27;t bother about it.  After all, you do like a fellow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And a little intelligence might spoil it?&quot; I still detained him.</p>
<p>He hesitated.  &quot;Well, you&#x27;ve got a heart in your body.  Is that an  element of form or an element of feeling?  What I contend that  nobody has ever mentioned in my work is the organ of life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see - it&#x27;s some idea ABOUT life, some sort of philosophy.   Unless it be,&quot; I added with the eagerness of a thought perhaps  still happier, &quot;some kind of game you&#x27;re up to with your style,  something you&#x27;re after in the language.  Perhaps it&#x27;s a preference  for the letter P!&quot; I ventured profanely to break out.  &quot;Papa,  potatoes, prunes - that sort of thing?&quot;  He was suitably indulgent:   he only said I hadn&#x27;t got the right letter.  But his amusement was  over; I could see he was bored.  There was nevertheless something  else I had absolutely to learn.  &quot;Should you be able, pen in hand,  to state it clearly yourself - to name it, phrase it, formulate  it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he almost passionately sighed, &quot;if I were only, pen in hand,  one of YOU chaps!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be a great chance for you of course.  But why should  you despise us chaps for not doing what you can&#x27;t do yourself?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can&#x27;t do?&quot;  He opened his eyes.  &quot;Haven&#x27;t I done it in twenty  volumes?  I do it in my way,&quot; he continued.  &quot;Go YOU and don&#x27;t do  it in yours.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ours is so devilish difficult,&quot; I weakly observed.</p>
<p>&quot;So&#x27;s mine.  We each choose our own.  There&#x27;s no compulsion.  You  won&#x27;t come down and smoke?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.  I want to think this thing out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll tell me then in the morning that you&#x27;ve laid me bare?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll see what I can do; I&#x27;ll sleep on it.  But just one word  more,&quot; I added.  We had left the room - I walked again with him a  few steps along the passage.  &quot;This extraordinary &#x27;general  intention,&#x27; as you call it - for that&#x27;s the most vivid description  I can induce you to make of it - is then, generally, a sort of  buried treasure?&quot;</p>
<p>His face lighted.  &quot;Yes, call it that, though it&#x27;s perhaps not for  me to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nonsense!&quot; I laughed.  &quot;You know you&#x27;re hugely proud of it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I didn&#x27;t propose to tell you so; but it IS the joy of my  soul!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean it&#x27;s a beauty so rare, so great?&quot;</p>
<p>He waited a little again.  &quot;The loveliest thing in the world!&quot;  We  had stopped, and on these words he left me; but at the end of the  corridor, while I looked after him rather yearningly, he turned and  caught sight of my puzzled face.  It made him earnestly, indeed I  thought quite anxiously, shake his head and wave his finger &quot;Give  it up - give it up!&quot;</p>
<p>This wasn&#x27;t a challenge - it was fatherly advice.  If I had had one  of his books at hand I&#x27;d have repeated my recent act of faith - I&#x27;d  have spent half the night with him.  At three o&#x27;clock in the  morning, not sleeping, remembering moreover how indispensable he  was to Lady Jane, I stole down to the library with a candle.  There  wasn&#x27;t, so far as I could discover, a line of his writing in the  house.</p>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<p>RETURNING to town I feverishly collected them all; I picked out  each in its order and held it up to the light.  This gave me a  maddening month, in the course of which several things took place.   One of these, the last, I may as well immediately mention, was that  I acted on Vereker&#x27;s advice:  I renounced my ridiculous attempt.  I  could really make nothing of the business; it proved a dead loss.   After all I had always, as he had himself noted, liked him; and  what now occurred was simply that my new intelligence and vain  preoccupation damaged my liking.  I not only failed to run a  general intention to earth, I found myself missing the subordinate  intentions I had formerly enjoyed.  His books didn&#x27;t even remain  the charming things they had been for me; the exasperation of my  search put me out of conceit of them.  Instead of being a pleasure  the more they became a resource the less; for from the moment I was  unable to follow up the author&#x27;s hint I of course felt it a point  of honour not to make use professionally of my knowledge of them.   I HAD no knowledge - nobody had any.  It was humiliating, but I  could bear it - they only annoyed me now.  At last they even bored  me, and I accounted for my confusion - perversely, I allow - by the  idea that Vereker had made a fool of me.  The buried treasure was a  bad joke, the general intention a monstrous pose.</p>
<p>The great point of it all is, however, that I told George Corvick  what had befallen me and that my information had an immense effect  upon him.  He had at last come back, but so, unfortunately, had  Mrs. Erme, and there was as yet, I could see, no question of his  nuptials.  He was immensely stirred up by the anecdote I had  brought from Bridges; it fell in so completely with the sense he  had had from the first that there was more in Vereker than met the  eye.  When I remarked that the eye seemed what the printed page had  been expressly invented to meet he immediately accused me of being  spiteful because I had been foiled.  Our commerce had always that  pleasant latitude.  The thing Vereker had mentioned to me was  exactly the thing he, Corvick, had wanted me to speak of in my  review.  On my suggesting at last that with the assistance I had  now given him he would doubtless be prepared to speak of it himself  he admitted freely that before doing this there was more he must  understand.  What he would have said, had he reviewed the new book,  was that there was evidently in the writer&#x27;s inmost art something  to BE understood.  I hadn&#x27;t so much as hinted at that:  no wonder  the writer hadn&#x27;t been flattered!  I asked Corvick what he really  considered he meant by his own supersubtlety, and, unmistakeably  kindled, he replied:  &quot;It isn&#x27;t for the vulgar - it isn&#x27;t for the  vulgar!&quot;  He had hold of the tail of something; he would pull hard,  pull it right out.  He pumped me dry on Vereker&#x27;s strange  confidence and, pronouncing me the luckiest of mortals, mentioned  half a dozen questions he wished to goodness I had had the gumption  to put.  Yet on the other hand he didn&#x27;t want to be told too much -  it would spoil the fun of seeing what would come.  The failure of  MY fun was at the moment of our meeting not complete, but I saw it  ahead, and Corvick saw that I saw it.  I, on my side, saw likewise  that one of the first things he would do would be to rush off with  my story to Gwendolen.</p>
<p>On the very day after my talk with him I was surprised by the  receipt of a note from Hugh Vereker, to whom our encounter at  Bridges had been recalled, as he mentioned, by his falling, in a  magazine, on some article to which my signature was attached.  &quot;I  read it with great pleasure,&quot; he wrote, &quot;and remembered under its  influence our lively conversation by your bedroom fire.  The  consequence of this has been that I begin to measure the temerity  of my having saddled you with a knowledge that you may find  something of a burden.  Now that the fit&#x27;s over I can&#x27;t imagine how  I came to be moved so much beyond my wont.  I had never before  mentioned, no matter in what state of expansion, the fact of my  little secret, and I shall never speak of that mystery again.  I  was accidentally so much more explicit with you than it had ever  entered into my game to be, that I find this game - I mean the  pleasure of playing it -  suffers considerably.  In short, if you  can understand it, I&#x27;ve rather spoiled my sport.  I really don&#x27;t  want to give anybody what I believe you clever young men call the  tip.  That&#x27;s of course a selfish solicitude, and I name it to you  for what it may be worth to you.  If you&#x27;re disposed to humour me  don&#x27;t repeat my revelation.  Think me demented - it&#x27;s your right;  but don&#x27;t tell anybody why.&quot;</p>
<p>The sequel to this communication was that as early on the morrow as  I dared I drove straight to Mr. Vereker&#x27;s door.  He occupied in  those years one of the honest old houses in Kensington Square.  He  received me immediately, and as soon as I came in I saw I hadn&#x27;t  lost my power to minister to his mirth.  He laughed out at sight of  my face, which doubtless expressed my perturbation.  I had been  indiscreet - my compunction was great.  &quot;I HAVE told somebody,&quot; I  panted, &quot;and I&#x27;m sure that person will by this time have told  somebody else!  It&#x27;s a woman, into the bargain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The person you&#x27;ve told?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, the other person.  I&#x27;m quite sure he must have told her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For all the good it will do her - or do ME!  A woman will never  find out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, but she&#x27;ll talk all over the place:  she&#x27;ll do just what you  don&#x27;t want.&quot;</p>
<p>Vereker thought a moment, but wasn&#x27;t so disconcerted as I had  feared:  he felt that if the harm was done it only served him  right.  &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter - don&#x27;t worry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll do my best, I promise you, that your talk with me shall go no  further.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very good; do what you can.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the meantime,&quot; I pursued, &quot;George Corvick&#x27;s possession of the  tip may, on his part, really lead to something.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That will be a brave day.&quot;</p>
<p>I told him about Corvick&#x27;s cleverness, his admiration, the  intensity of his interest in my anecdote; and without making too  much of the divergence of our respective estimates mentioned that  my friend was already of opinion that he saw much further into a  certain affair than most people.  He was quite as fired as I had  been at Bridges.  He was moreover in love with the young lady:   perhaps the two together would puzzle something out.</p>
<p>Vereker seemed struck with this.  &quot;Do you mean they&#x27;re to be  married?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I dare say that&#x27;s what it will come to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That may help them,&quot; he conceded, &quot;but we must give them time!&quot;</p>
<p>I spoke of my own renewed assault and confessed my difficulties;  whereupon he repeated his former advice:  &quot;Give it up, give it up!&quot;   He evidently didn&#x27;t think me intellectually equipped for the  adventure.  I stayed half an hour, and he was most good-natured,  but I couldn&#x27;t help pronouncing him a man of unstable moods.  He  had been free with me in a mood, he had repented in a mood, and now  in a mood he had turned indifferent.  This general levity helped me  to believe that, so far as the subject of the tip went, there  wasn&#x27;t much in it.  I contrived however to make him answer a few  more questions about it, though he did so with visible impatience.   For himself, beyond doubt, the thing we were all so blank about was  vividly there.  It was something, I guessed, in the primal plan,  something like a complex figure in a Persian carpet.  He highly  approved of this image when I used it, and he used another himself.   &quot;It&#x27;s the very string,&quot; he said, &quot;that my pearls are strung on!&quot;   The reason of his note to me had been that he really didn&#x27;t want to  give us a grain of succour - our density was a thing too perfect in  its way to touch.  He had formed the habit of depending on it, and  if the spell was to break it must break by some force of its own.   He comes back to me from that last occasion - for I was never to  speak to him again - as a man with some safe preserve for sport.  I  wondered as I walked away where he had got HIS tip.</p>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<p>WHEN I spoke to George Corvick of the caution I had received he  made me feel that any doubt of his delicacy would be almost an  insult.  He had instantly told Gwendolen, but Gwendolen&#x27;s ardent  response was in itself a pledge of discretion.  The question would  now absorb them and would offer them a pastime too precious to be  shared with the crowd.  They appeared to have caught instinctively  at Vereker&#x27;s high idea of enjoyment.  Their intellectual pride,  however, was not such as to make them indifferent to any further  light I might throw on the affair they had in hand.  They were  indeed of the &quot;artistic temperament,&quot; and I was freshly struck with  my colleague&#x27;s power to excite himself over a question of art.   He&#x27;d call it letters, he&#x27;d call it life, but it was all one thing.   In what he said I now seemed to understand that he spoke equally  for Gwendolen, to whom, as soon as Mrs. Erme was sufficiently  better to allow her a little leisure, he made a point of  introducing me.  I remember our going together one Sunday in August  to a huddled house in Chelsea, and my renewed envy of Corvick&#x27;s  possession of a friend who had some light to mingle with his own.   He could say things to her that I could never say to him.  She had  indeed no sense of humour and, with her pretty way of holding her  head on one side, was one of those persons whom you want, as the  phrase is, to shake, but who have learnt Hungarian by themselves.   She conversed perhaps in Hungarian with Corvick; she had remarkably  little English for his friend.  Corvick afterwards told me that I  had chilled her by my apparent indisposition to oblige them with  the detail of what Vereker had said to me.  I allowed that I felt I  had given thought enough to that indication:  hadn&#x27;t I even made up  my mind that it was vain and would lead nowhere?  The importance  they attached to it was irritating and quite envenomed my doubts.</p>
<p>That statement looks unamiable, and what probably happened was that  I felt humiliated at seeing other persons deeply beguiled by an  experiment that had brought me only chagrin.  I was out in the cold  while, by the evening fire, under the lamp, they followed the chase  for which I myself had sounded the horn.  They did as I had done,  only more deliberately and sociably - they went over their author  from the beginning.  There was no hurry, Corvick said -the future  was before them and the fascination could only grow; they would  take him page by page, as they would take one of the classics,  inhale him in slow draughts and let him sink all the way in.  They  would scarce have got so wound up, I think, if they hadn&#x27;t been in  love:  poor Vereker&#x27;s inner meaning gave them endless occasion to  put and to keep their young heads together.  None the less it  represented the kind of problem for which Corvick had a special  aptitude, drew out the particular pointed patience of which, had he  lived, he would have given more striking and, it is to be hoped,  more fruitful examples.  He at least was, in Vereker&#x27;s words, a  little demon of subtlety.  We had begun by disputing, but I soon  saw that without my stirring a finger his infatuation would have  its bad hours.  He would bound off on false scents as I had done -  he would clap his hands over new lights and see them blown out by  the wind of the turned page.  He was like nothing, I told him, but  the maniacs who embrace some bedlamitical theory of the cryptic  character of Shakespeare.  To this he replied that if we had had  Shakespeare&#x27;s own word for his being cryptic he would at once have  accepted it.  The case there was altogether different - we had  nothing but the word of Mr. Snooks.  I returned that I was  stupefied to see him attach such importance even to the word of Mr.  Vereker.  He wanted thereupon to know if I treated Mr. Vereker&#x27;s  word as a lie.  I wasn&#x27;t perhaps prepared, in my unhappy rebound,  to go so far as that, but I insisted that till the contrary was  proved I should view it as too fond an imagination.  I didn&#x27;t, I  confess, say - I didn&#x27;t at that time quite know - all I felt.  Deep  down, as Miss Erme would have said, I was uneasy, I was expectant.   At the core of my disconcerted state - for my wonted curiosity  lived in its ashes - was the sharpness of a sense that Corvick  would at last probably come out somewhere.  He made, in defence of  his credulity, a great point of the fact that from of old, in his  study of this genius, he had caught whiffs and hints of he didn&#x27;t  know what, faint wandering notes of a hidden music.  That was just  the rarity, that was the charm:  it fitted so perfectly into what I  reported.</p>
<p>If I returned on several occasions to the little house in Chelsea I  dare say it was as much for news of Vereker as for news of Miss  Erme&#x27;s ailing parent.  The hours spent there by Corvick were  present to my fancy as those of a chessplayer bent with a silent  scowl, all the lamplit winter, over his board and his moves.  As my  imagination filled it out the picture held me fast.  On the other  side of the table was a ghostlier form, the faint figure of an  antagonist good-humouredly but a little wearily secure - an  antagonist who leaned back in his chair with his hands in his  pockets and a smile on his fine clear face.  Close to Corvick,  behind him, was a girl who had begun to strike me as pale and  wasted and even, on more familiar view, as rather handsome, and who  rested on his shoulder and hung on his moves.  He would take up a  chessman and hold it poised a while over one of the little squares,  and then would put it back in its place with a long sigh of  disappointment.  The young lady, at this, would slightly but  uneasily shift her position and look across, very hard, very long,  very strangely, at their dim participant.  I had asked them at an  early stage of the business if it mightn&#x27;t contribute to their  success to have some closer communication with him.  The special  circumstances would surely be held to have given me a right to  introduce them.  Corvick immediately replied that he had no wish to  approach the altar before he had prepared the sacrifice.  He quite  agreed with our friend both as to the delight and as to the honour  of the chase - he would bring down the animal with his own rifle.   When I asked him if Miss Erme were as keen a shot he said after  thinking:  &quot;No, I&#x27;m ashamed to say she wants to set a trap.  She&#x27;d  give anything to see him; she says she requires another tip.  She&#x27;s  really quite morbid about it.  But she must play fair - she SHAN&#x27;T  see him!&quot; he emphatically added.  I wondered if they hadn&#x27;t even  quarrelled a little on the subject -  a suspicion not corrected by  the way he more than once exclaimed to me:  &quot;She&#x27;s quite incredibly  literary, you know - quite fantastically!&quot;  I remember his saying  of her that she felt in italics and thought in capitals.  &quot;Oh when  I&#x27;ve run him to earth,&quot; he also said, &quot;then, you know, I shall  knock at his door.  Rather - I beg you to believe.  I&#x27;ll have it  from his own lips:  &#x27;Right you are, my boy; you&#x27;ve done it this  time!&#x27;  He shall crown me victor - with the critical laurel.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile he really avoided the chances London life might have  given him of meeting the distinguished novelist; a danger, however,  that disappeared with Vereker&#x27;s leaving England for an indefinite  absence, as the newspapers announced - going to the south for  motives connected with the health of his wife, which had long kept  her in retirement.  A year - more than a year - had elapsed since  the incident at Bridges, but I had had no further sight of him.  I  think I was at bottom rather ashamed - I hated to remind him that,  though I had irremediably missed his point, a reputation for  acuteness was rapidly overtaking me.  This scruple led me a dance;  kept me out of Lady Jane&#x27;s house, made me even decline, when in  spite of my bad manners she was a second time so good as to make me  a sign, an invitation to her beautiful seat.  I once became aware  of her under Vereker&#x27;s escort at a concert, and was sure I was seen  by them, but I slipped out without being caught.  I felt, as on  that occasion I splashed along in the rain, that I couldn&#x27;t have  done anything else; and yet I remember saying to myself that it was  hard, was even cruel.  Not only had I lost the books, but I had  lost the man himself:  they and their author had been alike spoiled  for me.  I knew too which was the loss I most regretted.  I had  taken to the man still more than I had ever taken to the books.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<p>SIX months after our friend had left England George Corvick, who  made his living by his pen, contracted for a piece of work which  imposed on him an absence of some length and a journey of some  difficulty, and his undertaking of which was much of a surprise to  me.  His brother-in-law had become editor of a great provincial  paper, and the great provincial paper, in a fine flight of fancy,  had conceived the idea of sending a &quot;special commissioner&quot; to  India.  Special commissioners had begun, in the &quot;metropolitan  press,&quot; to be the fashion, and the journal in question must have  felt it had passed too long for a mere country cousin.  Corvick had  no hand, I knew, for the big brush of the correspondent, but that  was his brother-in-law&#x27;s affair, and the fact that a particular  task was not in his line was apt to be with himself exactly a  reason for accepting it.  He was prepared to out-Herod the  metropolitan press; he took solemn precautions against  priggishness, he exquisitely outraged taste.  Nobody ever knew it -  that offended principle was all his own.  In addition to his  expenses he was to be conveniently paid, and I found myself able to  help him, for the usual fat book, to a plausible arrangement with  the usual fat publisher.  I naturally inferred that his obvious  desire to make a little money was not unconnected with the prospect  of a union with Gwendolen Erme.  I was aware that her mother&#x27;s  opposition was largely addressed to his want of means and of  lucrative abilities, but it so happened that, on my saying the last  time I saw him something that bore on the question of his  separation from our young lady, he brought out with an emphasis  that startled me:  &quot;Ah I&#x27;m not a bit engaged to her, you know!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not overtly,&quot; I answered, &quot;because her mother doesn&#x27;t like you.   But I&#x27;ve always taken for granted a private understanding.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there WAS one.  But there isn&#x27;t now.&quot;  That was all he said  save something about Mrs. Erme&#x27;s having got on her feet again in  the most extraordinary way - a remark pointing, as I supposed, the  moral that private understandings were of little use when the  doctor didn&#x27;t share them.  What I took the liberty of more closely  inferring was that the girl might in some way have estranged him.   Well, if he had taken the turn of jealousy for instance it could  scarcely be jealousy of me.  In that case - over and above the  absurdity of it - he wouldn&#x27;t have gone away just to leave us  together.  For some time before his going we had indulged in no  allusion to the buried treasure, and from his silence, which my  reserve simply emulated, I had drawn a sharp conclusion.  His  courage had dropped, his ardour had gone the way of mine - this  appearance at least he left me to scan.  More than that he couldn&#x27;t  do; he couldn&#x27;t face the triumph with which I might have greeted an  explicit admission.  He needn&#x27;t have been afraid, poor dear, for I  had by this time lost all need to triumph.  In fact I considered I  showed magnanimity in not reproaching him with his collapse, for  the sense of his having thrown up the game made me feel more than  ever how much I at last depended on him.  If Corvick had broken  down I should never know; no one would be of any use if HE wasn&#x27;t.   It wasn&#x27;t a bit true I had ceased to care for knowledge; little by  little my curiosity not only had begun to ache again, but had  become the familiar torment of my days and my nights.  There are  doubtless people to whom torments of such an order appear hardly  more natural than the contortions of disease; but I don&#x27;t after all  know why I should in this connexion so much as mention them.  For  the few persons, at any rate, abnormal or not, with whom my  anecdote is concerned, literature was a game of skill, and skill  meant courage, and courage meant honour, and honour meant passion,  meant life.  The stake on the table was of a special substance and  our roulette the revolving mind, but we sat round the green board  as intently as the grim gamblers at Monte Carlo.  Gwendolen Erme,  for that matter, with her white face and her fixed eyes, was of the  very type of the lean ladies one had met in the temples of chance.   I recognised in Corvick&#x27;s absence that she made this analogy vivid.   It was extravagant, I admit, the way she lived for the art of the  pen.  Her passion visibly preyed on her, and in her presence I felt  almost tepid.  I got hold of &quot;Deep Down&quot; again:  it was a desert in  which she had lost herself, but in which too she had dug a  wonderful hole in the sand - a cavity out of which Corvick had  still more remarkably pulled her.</p>
<p>Early in March I had a telegram from her, in consequence of which I  repaired immediately to Chelsea, where the first thing she said to  me was:  &quot;He has got it, he has got it!&quot;</p>
<p>She was moved, as I could see, to such depths that she must mean  the great thing.  &quot;Vereker&#x27;s idea?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His general intention.  George has cabled from Bombay.&quot;</p>
<p>She had the missive open there; it was emphatic though concise.   &quot;Eureka.  Immense.&quot;  That was all - he had saved the cost of the  signature.  I shared her emotion, but I was disappointed.  &quot;He  doesn&#x27;t say what it is.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How could he - in a telegram?  He&#x27;ll write it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But how does he know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Know it&#x27;s the real thing?  Oh I&#x27;m sure that when you see it you do  know.  Vera incessu patuit dea!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s you, Miss Erme, who are a &#x27;dear&#x27; for bringing me such news!&quot;  - I went all lengths in my high spirits.  &quot;But fancy finding our  goddess in the temple of Vishnu!  How strange of George to have  been able to go into the thing again in the midst of such different  and such powerful solicitations!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He hasn&#x27;t gone into it, I know; it&#x27;s the thing itself, let  severely alone for six months, that has simply sprung out at him  like a tigress out of the jungle.  He didn&#x27;t take a book with him -  on purpose; indeed he wouldn&#x27;t have needed to - he knows every  page, as I do, by heart.  They all worked in him together, and some  day somewhere, when he wasn&#x27;t thinking, they fell, in all their  superb intricacy, into the one right combination.  The figure in  the carpet came out.  That&#x27;s the way he knew it would come and the  real reason - you didn&#x27;t in the least understand, but I suppose I  may tell you now - why he went and why I consented to his going.   We knew the change would do it - that the difference of thought, of  scene, would give the needed touch, the magic shake.  We had  perfectly, we had admirably calculated.  The elements were all in  his mind, and in the secousse of a new and intense experience they  just struck light.&quot;  She positively struck light herself - she was  literally, facially luminous.  I stammered something about  unconscious cerebration, and she continued:  &quot;He&#x27;ll come right home  - this will bring him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To see Vereker, you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To see Vereker - and to see ME.  Think what he&#x27;ll have to tell  me!&quot;</p>
<p>I hesitated.  &quot;About India?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;About fiddlesticks!  About Vereker - about the figure in the  carpet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, as you say, we shall surely have that in a letter.&quot;</p>
<p>She thought like one inspired, and I remembered how Corvick had  told me long before that her face was interesting.  &quot;Perhaps it  can&#x27;t be got into a letter if it&#x27;s &#x27;immense.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps not if it&#x27;s immense bosh.  If he has hold of something  that can&#x27;t be got into a letter he hasn&#x27;t hold of THE thing.   Vereker&#x27;s own statement to me was exactly that the &#x27;figure&#x27; WOULD  fit into a letter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I cabled to George an hour ago - two words,&quot; said Gwendolen.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it indiscreet of me to ask what they were?&quot;</p>
<p>She hung fire, but at last brought them out.  &quot;&#x27;Angel, write.&#x27;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good!&quot; I exclaimed.  &quot;I&#x27;ll make it sure - I&#x27;ll send him the same.&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<p>MY words however were not absolutely the same - I put something  instead of &quot;angel&quot;; and in the sequel my epithet seemed the more  apt, for when eventually we heard from our traveller it was merely,  it was thoroughly to be tantalised.  He was magnificent in his  triumph, he described his discovery as stupendous; but his ecstasy  only obscured it - there were to be no particulars till he should  have submitted his conception to the supreme authority.  He had  thrown up his commission, he had thrown up his book, he had thrown  up everything but the instant need to hurry to Rapallo, on the  Genoese shore, where Vereker was making a stay.  I wrote him a  letter which was to await him at Aden - I besought him to relieve  my suspense.  That he had found my letter was indicated by a  telegram which, reaching me after weary days and in the absence of  any answer to my laconic dispatch to him at Bombay, was evidently  intended as a reply to both communications.  Those few words were  in familiar French, the French of the day, which Covick often made  use of to show he wasn&#x27;t a prig.  It had for some persons the  opposite effect, but his message may fairly be paraphrased.  &quot;Have  patience; I want to see, as it breaks on you, the face you&#x27;ll  make!&quot;  &quot;Tellement envie de voir ta tete!&quot; - that was what I had to  sit down with.  I can certainly not be said to have sat down, for I  seem to remember myself at this time as rattling constantly between  the little house in Chelsea and my own.  Our impatience,  Gwendolen&#x27;s and mine, was equal, but I kept hoping her light would  be greater.  We all spent during this episode, for people of our  means, a great deal of money in telegrams and cabs, and I counted  on the receipt of news from Rapallo immediately after the junction  of the discoverer with the discovered.  The interval seemed an age,  but late one day I heard a hansom precipitated to my door with the  crash engendered by a hint of liberality.  I lived with my heart in  my mouth and accordingly bounded to the window - a movement which  gave me a view of a young lady erect on the footboard of the  vehicle and eagerly looking up at my house.  At sight of me she  flourished a paper with a movement that brought me straight down,  the movement with which, in melodramas, handkerchiefs and reprieves  are flourished at the foot of the scaffold.</p>
<p>&quot;Just seen Vereker - not a note wrong.  Pressed me to bosom - keeps  me a month.&quot;  So much I read on her paper while the cabby dropped a  grin from his perch.  In my excitement I paid him profusely and in  hers she suffered it; then as he drove away we started to walk  about and talk.  We had talked, heaven knows, enough before, but  this was a wondrous lift.  We pictured the whole scene at Rapallo,  where he would have written, mentioning my name, for permission to  call; that is I pictured it, having more material than my  companion, whom I felt hang on my lips as we stopped on purpose  before shop-windows we didn&#x27;t look into.  About one thing we were  clear:  if he was staying on for fuller communication we should at  least have a letter from him that would help us through the dregs  of delay.  We understood his staying on, and yet each of us saw, I  think, that the other hated it.  The letter we were clear about  arrived; it was for Gwendolen, and I called on her in time to save  her the trouble of bringing it to me.  She didn&#x27;t read it out, as  was natural enough; but she repeated to me what it chiefly  embodied.  This consisted of the remarkable statement that he&#x27;d  tell her after they were married exactly what she wanted to know.</p>
<p>&quot;Only THEN, when I&#x27;m his wife - not before,&quot; she explained.  &quot;It&#x27;s  tantamount to saying - isn&#x27;t it? - that I must marry him straight  off!&quot;  She smiled at me while I flushed with disappointment, a  vision of fresh delay that made me at first unconscious of my  surprise.  It seemed more than a hint that on me as well he would  impose some tiresome condition.  Suddenly, while she reported  several more things from his letter, I remembered what he had told  me before going away.  He had found Mr. Vereker deliriously  interesting and his own possession of the secret a real  intoxication.  The buried treasure was all gold and gems.  Now that  it was there it seemed to grow and grow before him; it would have  been, through all time and taking all tongues, one of the most  wonderful flowers of literary art.  Nothing, in especial, once you  were face to face with it, could show for more consummately DONE.   When once it came out it came out, was there with a splendour that  made you ashamed; and there hadn&#x27;t been, save in the bottomless  vulgarity of the age, with every one tasteless and tainted, every  sense stopped, the smallest reason why it should have been  overlooked.  It was great, yet so simple, was simple, yet so great,  and the final knowledge of it was an experience quite apart.  He  intimated that the charm of such an experience, the desire to drain  it, in its freshness, to the last drop, was what kept him there  close to the source.  Gwendolen, frankly radiant as she tossed me  these fragments, showed the elation of a prospect more assured than  my own.  That brought me back to the question of her marriage,  prompted me to ask if what she meant by what she had just surprised  me with was that she was under an engagement.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I am!&quot; she answered.  &quot;Didn&#x27;t you know it?&quot;  She seemed  astonished, but I was still more so, for Corvick had told me the  exact contrary.  I didn&#x27;t mention this, however; I only reminded  her how little I had been on that score in her confidence, or even  in Corvick&#x27;s, and that, moreover I wasn&#x27;t in ignorance of her  mother&#x27;s interdict.  At bottom I was troubled by the disparity of  the two accounts; but after a little I felt Corvick&#x27;s to be the one  I least doubted.  This simply reduced me to asking myself if the  girl had on the spot improvised an engagement - vamped up an old  one or dashed off a new - in order to arrive at the satisfaction  she desired.  She must have had resources of which I was destitute,  but she made her case slightly more intelligible by returning  presently:  &quot;What the state of things has been is that we felt of  course bound to do nothing in mamma&#x27;s lifetime.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But now you think you&#x27;ll just dispense with mamma&#x27;s consent?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah it mayn&#x27;t come to that!&quot;  I wondered what it might come to, and  she went on:  &quot;Poor dear, she may swallow the dose.  In fact, you  know,&quot; she added with a laugh, &quot;she really MUST!&quot; - a proposition  of which, on behalf of every one concerned, I fully acknowledged  the force.</p>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<p>NOTHING more vexatious had ever happened to me than to become aware  before Corvick&#x27;s arrival in England that I shouldn&#x27;t be there to  put him through.  I found myself abruptly called to Germany by the  alarming illness of my younger brother, who, against my advice, had  gone to Munich to study, at the feet indeed of a great master, the  art of portraiture in oils.  The near relative who made him an  allowance had threatened to withdraw it if he should, under  specious pretexts, turn for superior truth to Paris - Paris being  somehow, for a Cheltenham aunt, the school of evil, the abyss.  I  deplored this prejudice at the time, and the deep injury of it was  now visible - first in the fact that it hadn&#x27;t saved the poor boy,  who was clever, frail and foolish, from congestion of the lungs,  and second in the greater break with London to which the event  condemned me.  I&#x27;m afraid that what was uppermost in my mind during  several anxious weeks was the sense that if we had only been in  Paris I might have run over to see Corvick.  This was actually out  of the question from every point of view:  my brother, whose  recovery gave us both plenty to do, was ill for three months,  during which I never left him and at the end of which we had to  face the absolute prohibition of a return to England.  The  consideration of climate imposed itself, and he was in no state to  meet it alone.  I took him to Meran and there spent the summer with  him, trying to show him by example how to get back to work and  nursing a rage of another sort that I tried NOT to show him.</p>
<p>The whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so  strangely interlaced that, taken together - which was how I had to  take them - they form as good an illustration as I can recall of  the manner in which, for the good of his soul doubtless, fate  sometimes deals with a man&#x27;s avidity.  These incidents certainly  had larger bearings than the comparatively meagre consequence we  are here concerned with - though I feel that consequence also a  thing to speak of with some respect.  It&#x27;s mainly in such a light,  I confess, at any rate, that the ugly fruit of my exile is at this  hour present to me.  Even at first indeed the spirit in which my  avidity, as I have called it, made me regard that term owed no  element of ease to the fact that before coming back from Rapallo  George Corvick addressed me in a way I objected to.  His letter had  none of the sedative action I must to-day profess myself sure he  had wished to give it, and the march of occurrences was not so  ordered as to make up for what it lacked.  He had begun on the  spot, for one of the quarterlies, a great last word on Vereker&#x27;s  writings, and this exhaustive study, the only one that would have  counted, have existed, was to turn on the new light, to utter - oh,  so quietly! - the unimagined truth.  It was in other words to trace  the figure in the carpet through every convolution, to reproduce it  in every tint.  The result, according to my friend, would be the  greatest literary portrait ever painted, and what he asked of me  was just to be so good as not to trouble him with questions till he  should hang up his masterpiece before me.  He did me the honour to  declare that, putting aside the great sitter himself, all aloft in  his indifference, I was individually the connoisseur he was most  working for.  I was therefore to be a good boy and not try to peep  under the curtain before the show was ready:  I should enjoy it all  the more if I sat very still.</p>
<p>I did my best to sit very still, but I couldn&#x27;t help giving a jump  on seeing in THE TIMES, after I had been a week or two in Munich  and before, as I knew, Corvick had reached London, the   announcement of the sudden death of poor Mrs. Erme.  I instantly,  by letter, appealed to Gwendolen for particulars, and she wrote me  that her mother had yielded to long-threatened failure of the  heart.  She didn&#x27;t say, but I took the liberty of reading into her  words, that from the point of view of her marriage and also of her  eagerness, which was quite a match for mine, this was a solution  more prompt than could have been expected and more radical than  waiting for the old lady to swallow the dose.  I candidly admit  indeed that at the time - for I heard from her repeatedly - I read  some singular things into Gwendolen&#x27;s words and some still more  extraordinary ones into her silences.  Pen in hand, this way, I  live the time over, and it brings back the oddest sense of my  having been, both for months and in spite of myself, a kind of  coerced spectator.  All my life had taken refuge in my eyes, which  the procession of events appeared to have committed itself to keep  astare.  There were days when I thought of writing to Hugh Vereker  and simply throwing myself on his charity.  But I felt more deeply  that I hadn&#x27;t fallen quite so low - besides which, quite properly,  he would send me about my business.  Mrs. Erme&#x27;s death brought  Corvick straight home, and within the month he was united &quot;very  quietly&quot; - as quietly, I seemed to make out, as he meant in his  article to bring out his trouvaille - to the young lady he had  loved and quitted.  I use this last term, I may parenthetically  say, because I subsequently grew sure that at the time he went to  India, at the time of his great news from Bombay, there had been no  positive pledge between them whatever.  There had been none at the  moment she was affirming to me the very opposite.  On the other  hand he had certainly become engaged the day he returned.  The  happy pair went down to Torquay for their honeymoon, and there, in  a reckless hour, it occurred to poor Corvick to take his young  bride a drive.  He had no command of that business:  this had been  brought home to me of old in a little tour we had once made  together in a dogcart.  In a dogcart he perched his companion for a  rattle over Devonshire hills, on one of the likeliest of which he  brought his horse, who, it was true, had bolted, down with such  violence that the occupants of the cart were hurled forward and  that he fell horribly on his head.  He was killed on the spot;  Gwendolen escaped unhurt.</p>
<p>I pass rapidly over the question of this unmitigated tragedy, of  what the loss of my best friend meant for me, and I complete my  little history of my patience and my pain by the frank statement of  my having, in a postscript to my very first letter to her after the  receipt of the hideous news, asked Mrs. Corvick whether her husband  mightn&#x27;t at least have finished the great article on Vereker.  Her  answer was as prompt as my question:  the article, which had been  barely begun, was a mere heartbreaking scrap.  She explained that  our friend, abroad, had just settled down to it when interrupted by  her mother&#x27;s death, and that then, on his return, he had been kept  from work by the engrossments into which that calamity was to  plunge them.  The opening pages were all that existed; they were  striking, they were promising, but they didn&#x27;t unveil the idol.   That great intellectual feat was obviously to have formed his  climax.  She said nothing more, nothing to enlighten me as to the  state of her own knowledge - the knowledge for the acquisition of  which I had fancied her prodigiously acting.  This was above all  what I wanted to know:  had SHE seen the idol unveiled?  Had there  been a private ceremony for a palpitating audience of one?  For  what else but that ceremony had the nuptials taken place?  I didn&#x27;t  like as yet to press her, though when I thought of what had passed  between us on the subject in Corvick&#x27;s absence her reticence  surprised me.  It was therefore not till much later, from Meran,  that I risked another appeal, risked it in some trepidation, for  she continued to tell me nothing.  &quot;Did you hear in those few days  of your blighted bliss,&quot; I wrote, &quot;what we desired so to hear?&quot;  I  said, &quot;we,&quot; as a little hint and she showed me she could take a  little hint; &quot;I heard everything,&quot; she replied, &quot;and I mean to keep  it to myself!&quot;</p>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<p>IT was impossible not to be moved with the strongest sympathy for  her, and on my return to England I showed her every kindness in my  power.  Her mother&#x27;s death had made her means sufficient, and she  had gone to live in a more convenient quarter.  But her loss had  been great and her visitation cruel; it never would have occurred  to me moreover to suppose she could come to feel the possession of  a technical tip, of a piece of literary experience, a counterpoise  to her grief.  Strange to say, none the less, I couldn&#x27;t help  believing after I had seen her a few times that I caught a glimpse  of some such oddity.  I hasten to add that there had been other  things I couldn&#x27;t help believing, or at least imagining; and as I  never felt I was really clear about these, so, as to the point I  here touch on, I give her memory the benefit of the doubt.   Stricken and solitary, highly accomplished and now, in her deep  mourning, her maturer grace and her uncomplaining sorrow,  incontestably handsome, she presented herself as leading a life of  singular dignity and beauty.  I had at first found a way to  persuade myself that I should soon get the better of the reserve  formulated, the week after the catastrophe in her reply to an  appeal as to which I was not unconscious that it might strike her  as mistimed.  Certainly that reserve was something of a shock to me  - certainly it puzzled me the more I thought of it and even though  I tried to explain it (with moments of success) by an imputation of  exalted sentiments, of superstitious scruples, of a refinement of  loyalty.  Certainly it added at the same time hugely to the price  of Vereker&#x27;s secret, precious as this mystery already appeared.  I  may as well confess abjectly that Mrs. Corvick&#x27;s unexpected  attitude was the final tap on the nail that was to fix fast my  luckless idea, convert it into the obsession of which I&#x27;m for ever  conscious.</p>
<p>But this only helped me the more to be artful, to be adroit, to  allow time to elapse before renewing my suit.  There were plenty of  speculations for the interval, and one of them was deeply  absorbing.  Corvick had kept his information from his young friend  till after the removal of the last barrier to their intimacy - then  only had he let the cat out of the bag.  Was it Gwendolen&#x27;s idea,  taking a hint from him, to liberate this animal only on the basis  of the renewal of such a relation?  Was the figure in the carpet  traceable or describable only for husbands and wives - for lovers  supremely united?  It came back to me in a mystifying manner that  in Kensington Square, when I mentioned that Corvick would have told  the girl he loved, some word had dropped from Vereker that gave  colour to this possibility.  There might be little in it, but there  was enough to make me wonder if I should have to marry Mrs. Corvick  to get what I wanted.  Was I prepared to offer her this price for  the blessing of her knowledge?  Ah that way madness lay! - so I at  least said to myself in bewildered hours.  I could see meanwhile  the torch she refused to pass on flame away in her chamber of  memory - pour through her eyes a light that shone in her lonely  house.  At the end of six months I was fully sure of what this warm  presence made up to her for.  We had talked again and again of the  man who had brought us together - of his talent, his character, his  personal charm, his certain career, his dreadful doom, and even of  his clear purpose in that great study which was to have been a  supreme literary portrait, a kind of critical Vandyke or Velasquez.   She had conveyed to me in abundance that she was tongue-tied by her  perversity, by her piety, that she would never break the silence it  had not been given to the &quot;right person,&quot; as she said, to break.   The hour however finally arrived.  One evening when I had been  sitting with her longer than usual I laid my hand firmly on her  arm.  &quot;Now at last what IS it?&quot;</p>
<p>She had been expecting me and was ready.  She gave a long slow  soundless headshake, merciful only in being inarticulate.  This  mercy didn&#x27;t prevent its hurling at me the largest finest coldest  &quot;Never!&quot; I had yet, in the course of a life that had known denials,  had to take full in the face.  I took it and was aware that with  the hard blow the tears had come into my eyes.  So for a while we  sat and looked at each other; after which I slowly rose, I was  wondering if some day she would accept me; but this was not what I  brought out.  I said as I smoothed down my hat:  &quot;I know what to  think then.  It&#x27;s nothing!&quot;</p>
<p>A remote disdainful pity for me gathered in her dim smile; then she  spoke in a voice that I hear at this hour:  &quot;It&#x27;s my LIFE!&quot;  As I  stood at the door she added:  &quot;You&#x27;ve insulted him!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you mean Vereker?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean the Dead!&quot;</p>
<p>I recognised when I reached the street the justice of her charge.   Yes, it was her life - I recognised that too; but her life none the  less made room with the lapse of time for another interest.  A year  and a half after Corvick&#x27;s death she published in a single volume  her second novel, &quot;Overmastered,&quot; which I pounced on in the hope of  finding in it some tell-tale echo or some peeping face.  All I  found was a much better book than her younger performance, showing  I thought the better company she had kept.  As a tissue tolerably  intricate it was a carpet with a figure of its own; but the figure  was not the figure I was looking for.  On sending a review of it to  THE MIDDLE I was surprised to learn from the office that a notice  was already in type.  When the paper came out I had no hesitation  in attributing this article, which I thought rather vulgarly  overdone, to Drayton Deane, who in the old days had been something  of a friend of Corvick&#x27;s, yet had only within a few weeks made the  acquaintance of his widow.  I had had an early copy of the book,  but Deane had evidently had an earlier.  He lacked all the same the  light hand with which Corvick had gilded the gingerbread - he laid  on the tinsel in splotches.</p>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<p>SIX months later appeared &quot;The Right of Way,&quot; the last chance,  though we didn&#x27;t know it, that we were to have to redeem ourselves.   Written wholly during Vereker&#x27;s sojourn abroad, the book had been  heralded, in a hundred paragraphs, by the usual ineptitudes.  I  carried it, as early a copy as any, I this time flattered myself,  straightway to Mrs. Corvick.  This was the only use I had for it; I  left the inevitable tribute of THE MIDDLE to some more ingenious  mind and some less irritated temper.  &quot;But I already have it,&quot;  Gwendolen said.  &quot;Drayton Deane was so good as to bring it to me  yesterday, and I&#x27;ve just finished it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday?  How did he get it so soon?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He gets everything so soon!  He&#x27;s to review it in THE MIDDLE.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He - Drayton Deane - review Vereker?&quot;  I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears.</p>
<p>&quot;&#x27;Why not?  One fine ignorance is as good as another.&quot;</p>
<p>I winced but I presently said:  &quot;You ought to review him yourself!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t &#x27;review,&#x27;&quot; she laughed.  &quot;I&#x27;m reviewed!&quot;</p>
<p>Just then the door was thrown open.  &quot;Ah yes, here&#x27;s your  reviewer!&quot;  Drayton Deane was there with his long legs and his tall  forehead:  he had come to see what she thought of &quot;The Right of  Way,&quot; and to bring news that was singularly relevant.  The evening  papers were just out with a telegram on the author of that work,  who, in Rome, had been ill for some days with an attack of malarial  fever.  It had at first not been thought grave, but had taken, in  consequence of complications, a turn that might give rise to  anxiety.  Anxiety had indeed at the latest hour begun to be felt.</p>
<p>I was struck in the presence of these tidings with the fundamental  detachment that Mrs. Corvick&#x27;s overt concern quite failed to hide:   it gave me the measure of her consummate independence.  That  independence rested on her knowledge, the knowledge which nothing  now could destroy and which nothing could make different.  The  figure in the carpet might take on another twist or two, but the  sentence had virtually been written.  The writer might go down to  his grave:  she was the person in the world to whom - as if she had  been his favoured heir - his continued existence was least of a  need.  This reminded me how I had observed at a particular moment -  after Corvick&#x27;s death - the drop of her desire to see him face to  face.  She had got what she wanted without that.  I had been sure  that if she hadn&#x27;t got it she wouldn&#x27;t have been restrained from  the endeavour to sound him personally by those superior reflexions,  more conceivable on a man&#x27;s part than on a woman&#x27;s, which in my  case had served an a deterrent.  It wasn&#x27;t however, I hasten to  add, that my case, in spite of this invidious comparison, wasn&#x27;t  ambiguous enough.  At the thought that Vereker was perhaps at that  moment dying there rolled over me a wave of anguish - a poignant  sense of how inconsistently I still depended on him.  A delicacy  that it was my one compensation to suffer to rule me had left the  Alps and the Apennines between us, but the sense of the waning  occasion suggested that I might in my despair at last have gone to  him.  Of course I should really have done nothing of the sort.  I  remained five minutes, while my companions talked of the new book,  and when Drayton Deane appealed to me for my opinion of it I made  answer, getting up, that I detested Hugh Vereker and simply  couldn&#x27;t read him.  I departed with the moral certainty that as the  door closed behind me Deane would brand me for awfully superficial.   His hostess wouldn&#x27;t contradict THAT at least.</p>
<p>I continue to trace with a briefer touch our intensely odd  successions.  Three weeks after this came Vereker&#x27;s death, and  before the year was out the death of his wife.  That poor lady I  had never seen, but I had had a futile theory that, should she  survive him long enough to be decorously accessible, I might  approach her with the feeble flicker of my plea.  Did she know and  if she knew would she speak?  It was much to be presumed that for  more reasons than one she would have nothing to say; but when she  passed out of all reach I felt renannouncement indeed my appointed  lot.  I was shut up in my obsession for ever - my gaolers had gone  off with the key.  I find myself quite as vague as a captive in a  dungeon about the tinge that further elapsed before Mrs. Corvick  became the wife of Drayton Deane.  I had foreseen, through my bars,  this end of the business, though there was no indecent haste and  our friendship had fallen rather off.  They were both so &quot;awfully  intellectual&quot; that it struck people as a suitable match, but I had  measured better than any one the wealth of understanding the bride  would contribute to the union.  Never, for a marriage in literary  circles - so the newspapers described the alliance - had a lady  been so bravely dowered.  I began with due promptness to look for  the fruit of the affair - that fruit, I mean, of which the  premonitory symptoms would be peculiarly visible in the husband.   Taking for granted the splendour of the other party&#x27;s nuptial gift,  I expected to see him make a show commensurate with his increase of  means.  I knew what his means had been - his article on &quot;The Right  of Way&quot; had distinctly given one the figure.  As he was now exactly  in the position in which still more exactly I was not I watched  from month to month, in the likely periodicals, for the heavy  message poor Corvick had been unable to deliver and the  responsibility of which would have fallen on his successor.  The  widow and wife would have broken by the rekindled hearth the  silence that only a widow and wife might break, and Deane would be  as aflame with the knowledge as Corvick in his own hour, as  Gwendolen in hers, had been.  Well, he was aflame doubtless, but  the fire was apparently not to become a public blaze.  I scanned  the periodicals in vain:  Drayton Deane filled them with exuberant  pages, but he withheld the page I most feverishly sought.  He wrote  on a thousand subjects, but never on the subject of Vereker.  His  special line was to tell truths that other people either &quot;funked,&quot;  as he said, or overlooked, but he never told the only truth that  seemed to me in these days to signify.  I met the couple in those  literary circles referred to in the papers:  I have sufficiently  intimated that it was only in such circles we were all constructed  to revolve.  Gwendolen was more than ever committed to them by the  publication of her third novel, and I myself definitely classed by  holding the opinion that this work was inferior to its immediate  predecessor.  Was it worse because she had been keeping worse  company?  If her secret was, as she had told me, her life - a fact  discernible in her increasing bloom, an air of conscious privilege  that, cleverly corrected by pretty charities, gave distinction to  her appearance - it had yet not a direct influence on her work.   That only made one - everything only made one - yearn the more for  it; only rounded it off with a mystery finer and subtler.</p>
<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
<p>IT was therefore from her husband I could never remove my eyes:  I  beset him in a manner that might have made him uneasy.  I went even  so far as to engage him in conversation.  Didn&#x27;t he know, hadn&#x27;t he  come into it as a matter of course? - that question hummed in my  brain.  Of course he knew; otherwise he wouldn&#x27;t return my stare so  queerly.  His wife had told him what I wanted and he was amiably  amused at my impotence.  He didn&#x27;t laugh - he wasn&#x27;t a laugher:   his system was to present to my irritation, so that I should  crudely expose myself, a conversational blank as vast as his big  bare brow.  It always happened that I turned away with a settled  conviction from these unpeopled expanses, which seemed to complete  each other geographically and to symbolise together Drayton Deane&#x27;s  want of voice, want of form.  He simply hadn&#x27;t the art to use what  he knew; he literally was incompetent to take up the duty where  Corvick had left it.  I went still further - it was the only  glimpse of happiness I had.  I made up my mind that the duty didn&#x27;t  appeal to him.  He wasn&#x27;t interested, he didn&#x27;t care.  Yes, it  quite comforted me to believe him too stupid to have joy of the  thing I lacked.  He was as stupid after as he had been before, and  that deepened for me the golden glory in which the mystery was  wrapped.  I had of course none the less to recollect that his wife  might have imposed her conditions and exactions.  I had above all  to remind myself that with Vereker&#x27;s death the major incentive  dropped.  He was still there to be honoured by what might be done -  he was no longer there to give it his sanction.  Who alas but he  had the authority?</p>
<p>Two children were born to the pair, but the second cost the mother  her life.  After this stroke I seemed to see another ghost of a  chance.  I jumped at it in thought, but I waited a certain time for  manners, and at last my opportunity arrived in a remunerative way.   His wife had been dead a year when I met Drayton Deane in the  smoking-room of a small club of which we both were members, but  where for months - perhaps because I rarely entered it - I hadn&#x27;t  seen him.  The room was empty and the occasion propitious.  I  deliberately offered him, to have done with the matter for ever,  that advantage for which I felt he had long been looking.</p>
<p>&quot;As an older acquaintance of your late wife&#x27;s than even you were,&quot;  I began, &quot;you must let me say to you something I have on my mind.   I shall be glad to make any terms with you that you see fit to name  for the information she must have had from George Corvick - the  information you know, that had come to him, poor chap, in one of  the happiest hours of his life, straight from Hugh Vereker.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked at me like a dim phrenological bust.  &quot;The information -  ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Vereker&#x27;s secret, my dear man - the general intention of his  books:  the string the pearls were strung on, the buried treasure,  the figure in the carpet.&quot;</p>
<p>He began to flush - the numbers on his bumps to come out.   &quot;Vereker&#x27;s books had a general intention?&quot;</p>
<p>I stared in my turn.  &quot;You don&#x27;t mean to say you don&#x27;t know it?&quot;  I  thought for a moment he was playing with me.  &quot;Mrs. Deane knew it;  she had it, as I say, straight from Corvick, who had, after  infinite search and to Vereker&#x27;s own delight, found the very mouth  of the cave.  Where IS the mouth?  He told after their marriage -  and told alone - the person who, when the circumstances were  reproduced, must have told you.  Have I been wrong in taking for  granted that she admitted you, as one of the highest privileges of  the relation in which you stood to her, to the knowledge of which  she was after Corvick&#x27;s death the sole depositary?  All I know is  that that knowledge is infinitely precious, and what I want you to  understand is that if you&#x27;ll in your turn admit me to it you&#x27;ll do  me a kindness for which I shall be lastingly grateful.&quot;</p>
<p>He had turned at last very red; I dare say he had begun by thinking  I had lost my wits.  Little by little he followed me; on my own  side I stared with a livelier surprise.  Then he spoke. &quot;I don&#x27;t  know what you&#x27;re talking about.&quot;</p>
<p>He wasn&#x27;t acting - it was the absurd truth.</p>
<p>&quot;She DIDN&#x27;T tell you - ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing about Hugh Vereker.&quot;</p>
<p>I was stupefied; the room went round.  It had been too good even  for that!  &quot;Upon your honour?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Upon my honour.  What the devil&#x27;s the matter with you?&quot; he  growled.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m astounded - I&#x27;m disappointed.  I wanted to get it out of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It isn&#x27;t in me!&quot; he awkwardly laughed.  &quot;And even if it were - &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If it were you&#x27;d let me have it - oh yes, in common humanity.  But  I believe you.  I see - I see!&quot; I went on, conscious, with the full  turn of the wheel, of my great delusion, my false view of the poor  man&#x27;s attitude.  What I saw, though I couldn&#x27;t say it, was that his  wife hadn&#x27;t thought him worth enlightening.  This struck me as  strange for a woman who had thought him worth marrying.  At last I  explained it by the reflexion that she couldn&#x27;t possibly have  married him for his understanding.  She had married him for  something else.</p>
<p>He was to some extent enlightened now, but he was even more  astonished, more disconcerted:  he took a moment to compare my  story with his quickened memories.  The result of his meditation  was his presently saying with a good deal of rather feeble form:   &quot;This is the first I hear of what you allude to.  I think you must  be mistaken as to Mrs. Drayton Deane&#x27;s having had any unmentioned,  and still less any unmentionable, knowledge of Hugh Vereker.  She&#x27;d  certainly have wished it - should it have borne on his literary  character - to he used.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was used.  She used it herself.  She told me with her own lips  that she &#x27;lived&#x27; on it.&quot;</p>
<p>I had no sooner spoken than I repented of my words; he grew so pale  that I felt as if I had struck him.  &quot;Ah, &#x27;lived&#x27; -  !&quot; he  murmured, turning short away from me.</p>
<p>My compunction was real; I laid my hand on his shoulder.  &quot;I beg  you to forgive me - I&#x27;ve made a mistake.  You don&#x27;t know what I  thought you knew.  You could, if I had been right, have rendered me  a service; and I had my reasons for assuming that you&#x27;d be in a  position to meet me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your reasons?&quot; he asked.  &quot;What were your reasons?&quot;</p>
<p>I looked at him well; I hesitated; I considered.  &quot;Come and sit  down with me here, and I&#x27;ll tell you.&quot;  I drew him to a sofa, I  lighted another cigar and, beginning with the anecdote of Vereker&#x27;s  one descent from the clouds, I recited to him the extraordinary  chain of accidents that had, in spite of the original gleam, kept  me till that hour in the dark.  I told him in a word just what I&#x27;ve  written out here.  He listened with deepening attention, and I  became aware, to my surprise, by his ejaculations, by his  questions, that he would have been after all not unworthy to be  trusted by his wife.  So abrupt an experience of her want of trust  had now a disturbing effect on him; but I saw the immediate shock  throb away little by little and then gather again into waves of  wonder and curiosity - waves that promised, I could perfectly  judge, to break in the end with the fury of my own highest tides.   I may say that to-day as victims of unappeased desire there isn&#x27;t a  pin to choose between us.  The poor man&#x27;s state is almost my  consolation; there are really moments when I feel it to be quite my  revenge.</p>
