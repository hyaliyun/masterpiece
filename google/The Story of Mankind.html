<p>THE STORY OF MANKIND</p>
<p>BY HENDRIK VAN LOON, PH.D.</p>
<p>Professor of the Social Sciences in Antioch College.</p>
<p>Author of The Fall of the Dutch Republic, The Rise of the Dutch</p>
<p>Kingdom, The Golden Book of the Dutch Navigators,</p>
<p>A Short Story of Discovery, Ancient Man.</p>
<p>To JIMMIE</p>
<p>``What is the use of a book without pictures?&#x27;&#x27; said Alice.</p>
<p>FOREWORD</p>
<p>For Hansje and Willem:</p>
<p>WHEN I was twelve or thirteen years old, an uncle of</p>
<p>mine who gave me my love for books and pictures promised</p>
<p>to take me upon a memorable expedition. I was to go with</p>
<p>him to the top of the tower of Old Saint Lawrence in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>And so, one fine day, a sexton with a key as large as that</p>
<p>of Saint Peter opened a mysterious door. ``Ring the bell,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>he said, ``when you come back and want to get out,&#x27;&#x27; and with</p>
<p>a great grinding of rusty old hinges he separated us from the</p>
<p>noise of the busy street and locked us into a world of new and</p>
<p>strange experiences.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life I was confronted by the phenomenon</p>
<p>of audible silence. When we had climbed the first</p>
<p>flight of stairs, I added another discovery to my limited</p>
<p>knowledge of natural phenomena--that of tangible darkness. A</p>
<p>match showed us where the upward road continued. We went</p>
<p>to the next floor and then to the next and the next until I had</p>
<p>lost count and then there came still another floor, and suddenly</p>
<p>we had plenty of light. This floor was on an even height with</p>
<p>the roof of the church, and it was used as a storeroom. Covered</p>
<p>with many inches of dust, there lay the abandoned symbols</p>
<p>of a venerable faith which had been discarded by the good</p>
<p>people of the city many years ago. That which had meant life</p>
<p>and death to our ancestors was here reduced to junk and rub-</p>
<p>bish. The industrious rat had built his nest among the carved</p>
<p>images and the ever watchful spider had opened up shop between</p>
<p>the outspread arms of a kindly saint.</p>
<p>The next floor showed us from where we had derived our</p>
<p>light. Enormous open windows with heavy iron bars made</p>
<p>the high and barren room the roosting place of hundreds of</p>
<p>pigeons. The wind blew through the iron bars and the air was</p>
<p>filled with a weird and pleasing music. It was the noise of the</p>
<p>town below us, but a noise which had been purified and cleansed</p>
<p>by the distance. The rumbling of heavy carts and the clinking</p>
<p>of horses&#x27; hoofs, the winding of cranes and pulleys, the hissing</p>
<p>sound of the patient steam which had been set to do the work</p>
<p>of man in a thousand different ways--they had all been</p>
<p>blended into a softly rustling whisper which provided a beautiful</p>
<p>background for the trembling cooing of the pigeons.</p>
<p>Here the stairs came to an end and the ladders began. And</p>
<p>after the first ladder (a slippery old thing which made one feel</p>
<p>his way with a cautious foot) there was a new and even greater</p>
<p>wonder, the town-clock. I saw the heart of time. I could hear</p>
<p>the heavy pulsebeats of the rapid seconds--one--two--three--</p>
<p>up to sixty. Then a sudden quivering noise when all the wheels</p>
<p>seemed to stop and another minute had been chopped off eternity.</p>
<p>Without pause it began again--one--two--three--until</p>
<p>at last after a warning rumble and the scraping of many wheels</p>
<p>a thunderous voice, high above us, told the world that it was</p>
<p>the hour of noon.</p>
<p>On the next floor were the bells. The nice little bells and</p>
<p>their terrible sisters. In the centre the big bell, which made</p>
<p>me turn stiff with fright when I heard it in the middle of the</p>
<p>night telling a story of fire or flood. In solitary grandeur it</p>
<p>seemed to reflect upon those six hundred years during which</p>
<p>it had shared the joys and the sorrows of the good people of</p>
<p>Rotterdam. Around it, neatly arranged like the blue jars in</p>
<p>an old-fashioned apothecary shop, hung the little fellows, who</p>
<p>twice each week played a merry tune for the benefit of the</p>
<p>country-folk who had come to market to buy and sell and hear</p>
<p>what the big world had been doing. But in a corner--all alone</p>
<p>and shunned by the others--a big black bell, silent and stern,</p>
<p>the bell of death.</p>
<p>Then darkness once more and other ladders, steeper and</p>
<p>even more dangerous than those we had climbed before, and</p>
<p>suddenly the fresh air of the wide heavens. We had reached</p>
<p>the highest gallery. Above us the sky. Below us the city--</p>
<p>a little toy-town, where busy ants were hastily crawling hither</p>
<p>and thither, each one intent upon his or her particular business,</p>
<p>and beyond the jumble of stones, the wide greenness of the</p>
<p>open country.</p>
<p>It was my first glimpse of the big world.</p>
<p>Since then, whenever I have had the opportunity, I have</p>
<p>gone to the top of the tower and enjoyed myself. It was hard</p>
<p>work, but it repaid in full the mere physical exertion of climbing</p>
<p>a few stairs.</p>
<p>Besides, I knew what my reward would be. I would see the</p>
<p>land and the sky, and I would listen to the stories of my kind</p>
<p>friend the watchman, who lived in a small shack, built in a</p>
<p>sheltered corner of the gallery. He looked after the clock</p>
<p>and was a father to the bells, and he warned of fires, but he</p>
<p>enjoyed many free hours and then he smoked a pipe and</p>
<p>thought his own peaceful thoughts. He had gone to school almost</p>
<p>fifty years before and he had rarely read a book, but he</p>
<p>had lived on the top of his tower for so many years that he had</p>
<p>absorbed the wisdom of that wide world which surrounded him</p>
<p>on all sides.</p>
<p>History he knew well, for it was a living thing with him.</p>
<p><code>There,&#x27;&#x27; he would say, pointing to a bend of the river, </code>there,</p>
<p>my boy, do you see those trees? That is where the Prince of</p>
<p>Orange cut the dikes to drown the land and save Leyden.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Or he would tell me the tale of the old Meuse, until the broad</p>
<p>river ceased to be a convenient harbour and became a wonderful</p>
<p>highroad, carrying the ships of De Ruyter and Tromp upon</p>
<p>that famous last voyage, when they gave their lives that the</p>
<p>sea might be free to all.</p>
<p>Then there were the little villages, clustering around the</p>
<p>protecting church which once, many years ago, had been the</p>
<p>home of their Patron Saints. In the distance we could see the</p>
<p>leaning tower of Delft. Within sight of its high arches,</p>
<p>William the Silent had been murdered and there Grotius had</p>
<p>learned to construe his first Latin sentences. And still further</p>
<p>away, the long low body of the church of Gouda, the early home</p>
<p>of the man whose wit had proved mightier than the armies of</p>
<p>many an emperor, the charity-boy whom the world came to</p>
<p>know as Erasmus.</p>
<p>Finally the silver line of the endless sea and as a contrast,</p>
<p>immediately below us, the patchwork of roofs and chimneys</p>
<p>and houses and gardens and hospitals and schools and railways,</p>
<p>which we called our home. But the tower showed us</p>
<p>the old home in a new light. The confused commotion of the</p>
<p>streets and the market-place, of the factories and the workshop,</p>
<p>became the well-ordered expression of human energy</p>
<p>and purpose. Best of all, the wide view of the glorious past,</p>
<p>which surrounded us on all sides, gave us new courage to face</p>
<p>the problems of the future when we had gone back to our daily</p>
<p>tasks.</p>
<p>History is the mighty Tower of Experience, which Time</p>
<p>has built amidst the endless fields of bygone ages. It is no easy</p>
<p>task to reach the top of this ancient structure and get the benefit</p>
<p>of the full view. There is no elevator, but young feet are</p>
<p>strong and it can be done.</p>
<p>Here I give you the key that will open the door.</p>
<p>When you return, you too will understand the reason for</p>
<p>my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>HIGH Up in the North in the land called Svithjod, there</p>
<p>stands a rock. It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles</p>
<p>wide. Once every thousand years a little bird comes to this</p>
<p>rock to sharpen its beak.</p>
<p>When the rock has thus been worn away, then a single day</p>
<p>of eternity will have gone by.</p>
<p>THE SETTING OF THE STAGE</p>
<p>WE live under the shadow of a gigantic question mark.</p>
<p>Who are we?</p>
<p>Where do we come from?</p>
<p>Whither are we bound?</p>
<p>Slowly, but with persistent courage, we have been pushing</p>
<p>this question mark further and further towards that distant</p>
<p>line, beyond the horizon, where we hope to find our answer.</p>
<p>We have not gone very far.</p>
<p>We still know very little but we have reached the point</p>
<p>where (with a fair degree of accuracy) we can guess at many</p>
<p>things.</p>
<p>In this chapter I shall tell you how (according to our best</p>
<p>belief) the stage was set for the first appearance of man.</p>
<p>If we represent the time during which it has been possible for</p>
<p>animal life to exist upon our planet by a line of this length,</p>
<p>then the tiny line just below indicates the age during which</p>
<p>man (or a creature more or less resembling man) has lived</p>
<p>upon this earth.</p>
<p>Man was the last to come but the first to use his brain for</p>
<p>the purpose of conquering the forces of nature. That is the</p>
<p>reason why we are going to study him, rather than cats or</p>
<p>dogs or horses or any of the other animals, who, all in their</p>
<p>own way, have a very interesting historical development behind</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the planet upon which we live was (as far</p>
<p>as we now know) a large ball of flaming matter, a tiny cloud of</p>
<p>smoke in the endless ocean of space. Gradually, in the course</p>
<p>of millions of years, the surface burned itself out, and was covered</p>
<p>with a thin layer of rocks. Upon these lifeless rocks the</p>
<p>rain descended in endless torrents, wearing out the hard</p>
<p>granite and carrying the dust to the valleys that lay hidden between</p>
<p>the high cliffs of the steaming earth.</p>
<p>Finally the hour came when the sun broke through the</p>
<p>clouds and saw how this little planet was covered with a few</p>
<p>small puddles which were to develop into the mighty oceans of</p>
<p>the eastern and western hemispheres.</p>
<p>Then one day the great wonder happened. What had been</p>
<p>dead, gave birth to life.</p>
<p>The first living cell floated upon the waters of the sea.</p>
<p>For millions of years it drifted aimlessly with the currents.</p>
<p>But during all that time it was developing certain habits that</p>
<p>it might survive more easily upon the inhospitable earth. Some</p>
<p>of these cells were happiest in the dark depths of the lakes and</p>
<p>the pools. They took root in the slimy sediments which had</p>
<p>been carried down from the tops of the hills and they became</p>
<p>plants. Others preferred to move about and they grew</p>
<p>strange jointed legs, like scorpions and began to crawl along</p>
<p>the bottom of the sea amidst the plants and the pale green things</p>
<p>that looked like jelly-fishes. Still others (covered with scales)</p>
<p>depended upon a swimming motion to go from place to place</p>
<p>in their search for food, and gradually they populated the ocean</p>
<p>with myriads of fishes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the plants had increased in number and they had</p>
<p>to search for new dwelling places. There was no more room</p>
<p>for them at the bottom of the sea. Reluctantly they left the</p>
<p>water and made a new home in the marshes and on the mud-</p>
<p>banks that lay at the foot of the mountains. Twice a day the</p>
<p>tides of the ocean covered them with their brine. For the rest</p>
<p>of the time, the plants made the best of their uncomfortable</p>
<p>situation and tried to survive in the thin air which surrounded</p>
<p>the surface of the planet. After centuries of training, they</p>
<p>learned how to live as comfortably in the air as they had done in</p>
<p>the water. They increased in size and became shrubs and trees</p>
<p>and at last they learned how to grow lovely flowers which</p>
<p>attracted the attention of the busy big bumble-bees and the</p>
<p>birds who carried the seeds far and wide until the whole earth</p>
<p>had become covered with green pastures, or lay dark under the</p>
<p>shadow of the big trees. But some of the fishes too</p>
<p>had begun to leave the sea, and they had learned how to breathe</p>
<p>with lungs as well as with gills. We call such creatures amphibious,</p>
<p>which means that they are able to live with equal ease on the land</p>
<p>and in the water. The first frog who crosses your path can tell you</p>
<p>all about the pleasures of the double existence of the amphibian.</p>
<p>Once outside of the water, these animals gradually adapted</p>
<p>themselves more and more to life on land. Some became reptiles</p>
<p>(creatures who crawl like lizards) and they shared the</p>
<p>silence of the forests with the insects. That they might move</p>
<p>faster through the soft soil, they improved upon their legs</p>
<p>and their size increased until the world was populated with</p>
<p>gigantic forms (which the hand-books of biology list under</p>
<p>the names of Ichthyosaurus and Megalosaurus and Brontosaurus)</p>
<p>who grew to be thirty to forty feet long and who could have</p>
<p>played with elephants as a full grown cat plays with her kittens.</p>
<p>Some of the members of this reptilian family began to live in</p>
<p>the tops of the trees, which were then often more than a hundred</p>
<p>feet high. They no longer needed their legs for the purpose</p>
<p>of walking, but it was necessary for them to move quickly from</p>
<p>branch to branch. And so they changed a part of their skin</p>
<p>into a sort of parachute, which stretched between the sides of</p>
<p>their bodies and the small toes of their fore-feet, and gradually</p>
<p>they covered this skinny parachute with feathers and made</p>
<p>their tails into a steering gear and flew from tree to tree and</p>
<p>developed into true birds.</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened. All the gigantic reptiles</p>
<p>died within a short time. We do not know the reason. Perhaps</p>
<p>it was due to a sudden change in climate. Perhaps they</p>
<p>had grown so large that they could neither swim nor walk nor</p>
<p>crawl, and they starved to death within sight but not within</p>
<p>reach of the big ferns and trees. Whatever the cause, the</p>
<p>million year old world-empire of the big reptiles was over.</p>
<p>The world now began to be occupied by very different</p>
<p>creatures. They were the descendants of the reptiles but they</p>
<p>were quite unlike these because they fed their young from the</p>
<p>``mammae&#x27;&#x27; or the breasts of the mother. Wherefore modern</p>
<p>science calls these animals ``mammals.&#x27;&#x27; They had shed the</p>
<p>scales of the fish. They did not adopt the feathers of the bird,</p>
<p>but they covered their bodies with hair. The mammals however</p>
<p>developed other habits which gave their race a great advantage</p>
<p>over the other animals. The female of the species</p>
<p>carried the eggs of the young inside her body until they were</p>
<p>hatched and while all other living beings, up to that time, had</p>
<p>left their children exposed to the dangers of cold and heat,</p>
<p>and the attacks of wild beasts, the mammals kept their young</p>
<p>with them for a long time and sheltered them while they were</p>
<p>still too weak to fight their enemies. In this way the young</p>
<p>mammals were given a much better chance to survive, because</p>
<p>they learned many things from their mothers, as you will know</p>
<p>if you have ever watched a cat teaching her kittens to take</p>
<p>care of themselves and how to wash their faces and how to</p>
<p>catch mice.</p>
<p>But of these mammals I need not tell you much for you</p>
<p>know them well. They surround you on all sides. They are</p>
<p>your daily companions in the streets and in your home, and you</p>
<p>can see your less familiar cousins behind the bars of the zoological</p>
<p>garden.</p>
<p>And now we come to the parting of the ways when man</p>
<p>suddenly leaves the endless procession of dumbly living and</p>
<p>dying creatures and begins to use his reason to shape the</p>
<p>destiny of his race.</p>
<p>One mammal in particular seemed to surpass all others in</p>
<p>its ability to find food and shelter. It had learned to use its</p>
<p>fore-feet for the purpose of holding its prey, and by dint of</p>
<p>practice it had developed a hand-like claw. After innumerable</p>
<p>attempts it had learned how to balance the whole of the</p>
<p>body upon the hind legs. (This is a difficult act, which every</p>
<p>child has to learn anew although the human race has been</p>
<p>doing it for over a million years.)</p>
<p>This creature, half ape and half monkey but superior to</p>
<p>both, became the most successful hunter and could make a</p>
<p>living in every clime. For greater safety, it usually moved</p>
<p>about in groups. It learned how to make strange grunts to</p>
<p>warn its young of approaching danger and after many hundreds</p>
<p>of thousands of years it began to use these throaty noises</p>
<p>for the purpose of talking.</p>
<p>This creature, though you may hardly believe it, was your</p>
<p>first ``man-like&#x27;&#x27; ancestor.</p>
<p>OUR EARLIEST ANCESTORS</p>
<p>WE know very little about the first ``true&#x27;&#x27; men. We have</p>
<p>never seen their pictures. In the deepest layer of clay of an</p>
<p>ancient soil we have sometimes found pieces of their bones.</p>
<p>These lay buried amidst the broken skeletons of other animals</p>
<p>that have long since disappeared from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Anthropologists (learned scientists who devote their lives to</p>
<p>the study of man as a member of the animal kingdom) have</p>
<p>taken these bones and they have been able to reconstruct our</p>
<p>earliest ancestors with a fair degree of accuracy.</p>
<p>The great-great-grandfather of the human race was a very</p>
<p>ugly and unattractive mammal. He was quite small, much</p>
<p>smaller than the people of today. The heat of the sun and the</p>
<p>biting wind of the cold winter had coloured his skin a dark</p>
<p>brown. His head and most of his body, his arms and legs too,</p>
<p>were covered with long, coarse hair. He had very thin but</p>
<p>strong fingers which made his hands look like those of a monkey.</p>
<p>His forehead was low and his jaw was like the jaw of a</p>
<p>wild animal which uses its teeth both as fork and knife. He</p>
<p>wore no clothes. He had seen no fire except the flames of the</p>
<p>rumbling volcanoes which filled the earth with their smoke</p>
<p>and their lava.</p>
<p>He lived in the damp blackness of vast forests, as the</p>
<p>pygmies of Africa do to this very day. When he felt the</p>
<p>pangs of hunger he ate raw leaves and the roots of plants or</p>
<p>he took the eggs away from an angry bird and fed them to his</p>
<p>own young. Once in a while, after a long and patient chase,</p>
<p>he would catch a sparrow or a small wild dog or perhaps a</p>
<p>rabbit. These he would eat raw for he had never discovered</p>
<p>that food tasted better when it was cooked.</p>
<p>During the hours of day, this primitive human being</p>
<p>prowled about looking for things to eat.</p>
<p>When night descended upon the earth, he hid his wife and</p>
<p>his children in a hollow tree or behind some heavy boulders,</p>
<p>for he was surrounded on all sides by ferocious animals and</p>
<p>when it was dark these animals began to prowl about, looking</p>
<p>for something to eat for their mates and their own young, and</p>
<p>they liked the taste of human beings. It was a world where</p>
<p>you must either eat or be eaten, and life was very unhappy</p>
<p>because it was full of fear and misery.</p>
<p>In summer, man was exposed to the scorching rays of the</p>
<p>sun, and during the winter his children would freeze to death</p>
<p>in his arms. When such a creature hurt itself, (and hunting</p>
<p>animals are forever breaking their bones or spraining their</p>
<p>ankles) he had no one to take care of him and he must die a</p>
<p>horrible death.</p>
<p>Like many of the animals who fill the Zoo with their</p>
<p>strange noises, early man liked to jabber. That is to say, he</p>
<p>endlessly repeated the same unintelligible gibberish because it</p>
<p>pleased him to hear the sound of his voice. In due time he</p>
<p>learned that he could use this guttural noise to warn his fellow</p>
<p>beings whenever danger threatened and he gave certain little</p>
<p>shrieks which came to mean <code>there is a tiger!&#x27;&#x27; or </code>here come</p>
<p>five elephants.&#x27;&#x27; Then the others grunted something back at</p>
<p>him and their growl meant, <code>I see them,&#x27;&#x27; or </code>let us run away</p>
<p>and hide.&#x27;&#x27; And this was probably the origin of all language.</p>
<p>But, as I have said before, of these beginnings we know</p>
<p>so very little. Early man had no tools and he built himself</p>
<p>no houses. He lived and died and left no trace of his existence</p>
<p>except a few collar-bones and a few pieces of his skull.</p>
<p>These tell us that many thousands of years ago the world was</p>
<p>inhabited by certain mammals who were quite different from</p>
<p>all the other animals--who had probably developed from another</p>
<p>unknown ape-like animal which had learned to walk on</p>
<p>its hind-legs and use its fore-paws as hands--and who were</p>
<p>most probably connected with the creatures who happen to be</p>
<p>our own immediate ancestors.</p>
<p>It is little enough we know and the rest is darkness.</p>
<p>PREHISTORIC MAN</p>
<p>PREHISTORIC MAN BEGINS TO MAKE</p>
<p>THINGS FOR HIMSELF.</p>
<p>EARLY man did not know what time meant. He kept</p>
<p>no records of birthdays or wedding anniversaries or the hour</p>
<p>of death. He had no idea of days or weeks or even years.</p>
<p>But in a general way he kept track of the seasons for he had</p>
<p>noticed that the cold winter was invariably followed by the mild</p>
<p>spring--that spring grew into the hot summer when fruits</p>
<p>ripened and the wild ears of corn were ready to be eaten and</p>
<p>that summer ended when sudden gusts of wind swept the leaves</p>
<p>from the trees and a number of animals were getting ready</p>
<p>for the long hibernal sleep.</p>
<p>But now, something unusual and rather frightening had</p>
<p>happened. Something was the matter with the weather. The</p>
<p>warm days of summer had come very late. The fruits had</p>
<p>not ripened. The tops of the mountains which used to be covered</p>
<p>with grass now lay deeply hidden underneath a heavy</p>
<p>burden of snow.</p>
<p>Then, one morning, a number of wild people, different</p>
<p>from the other creatures who lived in that neighbourhood, came</p>
<p>wandering down from the region of the high peaks. They</p>
<p>looked lean and appeared to be starving. They uttered sounds</p>
<p>which no one could understand. They seemed to say that</p>
<p>they were hungry. There was not food enough for both the</p>
<p>old inhabitants and the newcomers. When they tried to stay</p>
<p>more than a few days there was a terrible battle with claw-like</p>
<p>hands and feet and whole families were killed. The others fled</p>
<p>back to their mountain slopes and died in the next blizzard.</p>
<p>But the people in the forest were greatly frightened. All</p>
<p>the time the days grew shorter and the nights grew colder than</p>
<p>they ought to have been.</p>
<p>Finally, in a gap between two high hills, there appeared a</p>
<p>tiny speck of greenish ice. Rapidly it increased in size. A</p>
<p>gigantic glacier came sliding downhill. Huge stones were</p>
<p>being pushed into the valley. With the noise of a dozen thunderstorms</p>
<p>torrents of ice and mud and blocks of granite suddenly</p>
<p>tumbled among the people of the forest and killed them</p>
<p>while they slept. Century old trees were crushed into kindling</p>
<p>wood. And then it began to snow.</p>
<p>It snowed for months and months. All the plants died and</p>
<p>the animals fled in search of the southern sun. Man hoisted</p>
<p>his young upon his back and followed them. But he could not</p>
<p>travel as fast as the wilder creatures and he was forced to</p>
<p>choose between quick thinking or quick dying. He seems to</p>
<p>have preferred the former for he has managed to survive the</p>
<p>terrible glacial periods which upon four different occasions</p>
<p>threatened to kill every human being on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>In the first place it was necessary that man clothe himself</p>
<p>lest he freeze to death. He learned how to dig holes and cover</p>
<p>them with branches and leaves and in these traps he caught</p>
<p>bears and hyenas, which he then killed with heavy stones and</p>
<p>whose skins he used as coats for himself and his family.</p>
<p>Next came the housing problem. This was simple. Many</p>
<p>animals were in the habit of sleeping in dark caves. Man now</p>
<p>followed their example, drove the animals out of their warm</p>
<p>homes and claimed them for his own.</p>
<p>Even so, the climate was too severe for most people and</p>
<p>the old and the young died at a terrible rate. Then a genius</p>
<p>bethought himself of the use of fire. Once, while out hunting,</p>
<p>he had been caught in a forest-fire. He remembered that he</p>
<p>had been almost roasted to death by the flames. Thus far fire</p>
<p>had been an enemy. Now it became a friend. A dead tree</p>
<p>was dragged into the cave and lighted by means of smouldering</p>
<p>branches from a burning wood. This turned the cave into</p>
<p>a cozy little room.</p>
<p>And then one evening a dead chicken fell into the fire. It</p>
<p>was not rescued until it had been well roasted. Man discovered</p>
<p>that meat tasted better when cooked and he then and there</p>
<p>discarded one of the old habits which he had shared with the</p>
<p>other animals and began to prepare his food.</p>
<p>In this way thousands of years passed. Only the people</p>
<p>with the cleverest brains survived. They had to struggle day</p>
<p>and night against cold and hunger. They were forced to invent</p>
<p>tools. They learned how to sharpen stones into axes and how</p>
<p>to make hammers. They were obliged to put up large stores</p>
<p>of food for the endless days of the winter and they found that</p>
<p>clay could be made into bowls and jars and hardened in the</p>
<p>rays of the sun. And so the glacial period, which had threatened</p>
<p>to destroy the human race, became its greatest teacher</p>
<p>because it forced man to use his brain.</p>
<p>HIEROGLYPHICS</p>
<p>THE EGYPTIANS INVENT THE ART OF</p>
<p>WRITING AND THE RECORD OF</p>
<p>HISTORY BEGINS</p>
<p>THESE earliest ancestors of ours who lived in the great</p>
<p>European wilderness were rapidly learning many new things.</p>
<p>It is safe to say that in due course of time they would have</p>
<p>given up the ways of savages and would have developed a</p>
<p>civilisation of their own. But suddenly there came an end to</p>
<p>their isolation. They were discovered.</p>
<p>A traveller from an unknown southland who had dared to</p>
<p>cross the sea and the high mountain passes had found his way</p>
<p>to the wild people of the European continent. He came from</p>
<p>Africa. His home was in Egypt.</p>
<p>The valley of the Nile had developed a high stage of civilisation</p>
<p>thousands of years before the people of the west had</p>
<p>dreamed of the possibilities of a fork or a wheel or a house.</p>
<p>And we shall therefore leave our great-great-grandfathers in</p>
<p>their caves, while we visit the southern and eastern shores of</p>
<p>the Mediterranean, where stood the earliest school of the</p>
<p>human race.</p>
<p>The Egyptians have taught us many things. They were</p>
<p>excellent farmers. They knew all about irrigation. They built</p>
<p>temples which were afterwards copied by the Greeks and which</p>
<p>served as the earliest models for the churches in which we worship</p>
<p>nowadays. They had invented a calendar which proved</p>
<p>such a useful instrument for the purpose of measuring time</p>
<p>that it has survived with a few changes until today. But most</p>
<p>important of all, the Egyptians had learned how to preserve</p>
<p>speech for the benefit of future generations. They had invented</p>
<p>the art of writing.</p>
<p>We are so accustomed to newspapers and books and magazines</p>
<p>that we take it for granted that the world has always been</p>
<p>able to read and write. As a matter of fact, writing, the most</p>
<p>important of all inventions, is quite new. Without written</p>
<p>documents we would be like cats and dogs, who can only teach</p>
<p>their kittens and their puppies a few simple things and who,</p>
<p>because they cannot write, possess no way in which they can</p>
<p>make use of the experience of those generations of cats and</p>
<p>dogs that have gone before.</p>
<p>In the first century before our era, when the Romans came</p>
<p>to Egypt, they found the valley full of strange little pictures</p>
<p>which seemed to have something to do with the history</p>
<p>of the country. But the Romans were not interested in ``anything</p>
<p>foreign&#x27;&#x27; and did not inquire into the origin of these queer</p>
<p>figures which covered the walls of the temples and the walls of</p>
<p>the palaces and endless reams of flat sheets made out of the</p>
<p>papyrus reed. The last of the Egyptian priests who had</p>
<p>understood the holy art of making such pictures had died several</p>
<p>years before. Egypt deprived of its independence had</p>
<p>become a store-house filled with important historical documents</p>
<p>which no one could decipher and which were of no earthly use</p>
<p>to either man or beast.</p>
<p>Seventeen centuries went by and Egypt remained a land</p>
<p>of mystery. But in the year 1798 a French general by the</p>
<p>name of Bonaparte happened to visit eastern Africa to prepare</p>
<p>for an attack upon the British Indian Colonies. He did</p>
<p>not get beyond the Nile, and his campaign was a failure. But,</p>
<p>quite accidentally, the famous French expedition solved the</p>
<p>problem of the ancient Egyptian picture-language.</p>
<p>One day a young French officer, much bored by the dreary</p>
<p>life of his little fortress on the Rosetta river (a mouth of the</p>
<p>Nile) decided to spend a few idle hours rummaging among</p>
<p>the ruins of the Nile Delta. And behold! he found a stone</p>
<p>which greatly puzzled him. Like everything else in Egypt</p>
<p>it was covered with little figures. But this particular slab of</p>
<p>black basalt was different from anything that had ever been</p>
<p>discovered. It carried three inscriptions. One of these was</p>
<p>in Greek. The Greek language was known. ``All that is</p>
<p>necessary,&#x27;&#x27; so he reasoned, ``is to compare the Greek text with</p>
<p>the Egyptian figures, and they will at once tell their secrets.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The plan sounded simple enough but it took more than</p>
<p>twenty years to solve the riddle. In the year 1802 a French</p>
<p>professor by the name of Champollion began to compare the</p>
<p>Greek and the Egyptian texts of the famous Rosetta stone. In</p>
<p>the year 1823 he announced that he had discovered the meaning</p>
<p>of fourteen little figures. A short time later he died from</p>
<p>overwork, but the main principles of Egyptian writing had</p>
<p>become known. Today the story of the valley of the Nile is</p>
<p>better known to us than the story of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>We possess a written record which covers four thousand years</p>
<p>of chronicled history.</p>
<p>As the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics (the word means</p>
<p>``sacred writing&#x27;&#x27;) have played such a very great role in</p>
<p>history, (a few of them in modified form have even found their</p>
<p>way into our own alphabet,) you ought to know something</p>
<p>about the ingenious system which was used fifty centuries ago</p>
<p>to preserve the spoken word for the benefit of the coming</p>
<p>generations.</p>
<p>Of course, you know what a sign language is. Every</p>
<p>Indian story of our western plains has a chapter devoted to</p>
<p>strange messages writter{sic} in the form of little pictures which</p>
<p>tell how many buffaloes were killed and how many hunters</p>
<p>there were in a certain party. As a rule it is not difficult to</p>
<p>understand the meaning of such messages.</p>
<p>Ancient Egyptian, however, was not a sign language. The</p>
<p>clever people of the Nile had passed beyond that stage long</p>
<p>before. Their pictures meant a great deal more than the object</p>
<p>which they represented, as I shall try to explain to you now.</p>
<p>Suppose that you were Champollion, and that you were</p>
<p>examining a stack of papyrus sheets, all covered with hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>Suddenly you came across a picture of a man with</p>
<p>a saw. <code>Very well,&#x27;&#x27; you would say, </code>that means of course that</p>
<p>a farmer went out to cut down a tree.&#x27;&#x27; Then you take another</p>
<p>papyrus. It tells the story of a queen who had died at the age</p>
<p>of eighty-two. In the midst of a sentence appears the picture</p>
<p>of the man with the saw. Queens of eighty-two do not handle</p>
<p>saws. The picture therefore must mean something else. But</p>
<p>what?</p>
<p>That is the riddle which the Frenchman finally solved.</p>
<p>He discovered that the Egyptians were the first to use what</p>
<p>we now call ``phonetic writing&#x27;&#x27;--a system of characters which</p>
<p>reproduce the ``sound&#x27;&#x27; (or phone) of the spoken word and</p>
<p>which make it possible for us to translate all our spoken words</p>
<p>into a written form, with the help of only a few dots and dashes</p>
<p>and pothooks.</p>
<p>Let us return for a moment to the little fellow with the saw.</p>
<p>The word ``saw&#x27;&#x27; either means a certain tool which you will find</p>
<p>in a carpenter&#x27;s shop, or it means the past tense of the verb</p>
<p>``to see.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>This is what had happened to the word during the course</p>
<p>of centuries. First of all it had meant only the particular tool</p>
<p>which it represented. Then that meaning had been lost and it</p>
<p>had become the past participle of a verb. After several hundred</p>
<p>years, the Egyptians lost sight of both these meanings and</p>
<p>the picture {illust.} came to stand for a single letter, the</p>
<p>letter S. A short sentence will show you what I mean. Here</p>
<p>is a modern English sentence as it would have been written in</p>
<p>hieroglyphics. {illust.}</p>
<p>The {illust.} either means one of these two round objects</p>
<p>in your head, which allow you to see or it means ``I,&#x27;&#x27; the person</p>
<p>who is talking.</p>
<p>A {illust.} is either an insect which gathers honey, or it</p>
<p>represents the verb ``to be&#x27;&#x27; which means to exist. Again, it</p>
<p>may be the first part of a verb like <code>be-come&#x27;&#x27; or </code>be-have.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>In this particular instance it is followed by {illust.} which</p>
<p>means a <code>leaf&#x27;&#x27; or </code>leave&#x27;&#x27; or ``lieve&#x27;&#x27; (the sound of all three</p>
<p>words is the same).</p>
<p>The ``eye&#x27;&#x27; you know all about.</p>
<p>Finally you get the picture of a {illust.}. It is a giraffe</p>
<p>It is part of the old sign-language out of which the hieroglyphics</p>
<p>developed.</p>
<p>You can now read that sentence without much difficulty.</p>
<p>``I believe I saw a giraffe.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Having invented this system the Egyptians developed it</p>
<p>during thousands of years until they could write anything they</p>
<p>wanted, and they used these ``canned words&#x27;&#x27; to send messages</p>
<p>to friends, to keep business accounts and to keep a record of the</p>
<p>history of their country, that future generations might benefit</p>
<p>by the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>THE NILE VALLEY</p>
<p>THE BEGINNING OF CIVILISATION IN THE</p>
<p>VALLEY OF THE NILE</p>
<p>THE history of man is the record of a hungry creature in</p>
<p>search of food. Wherever food was plentiful, thither man has</p>
<p>travelled to make his home.</p>
<p>The fame of the Valley of the Nile must have spread at</p>
<p>an early date. From the interior of Africa and from the desert</p>
<p>of Arabia and from the western part of Asia people had</p>
<p>flocked to Egypt to claim their share of the rich farms.</p>
<p>Together these invaders had formed a new race which called</p>
<p>itself <code>Remi&#x27;&#x27; or </code>the Men&#x27;&#x27; just as we sometimes call America</p>
<p>``God&#x27;s own country.&#x27;&#x27; They had good reason to be grateful</p>
<p>to a Fate which had carried them to this narrow strip of land.</p>
<p>In the summer of each year the Nile turned the valley into a</p>
<p>shallow lake and when the waters receded all the grainfields</p>
<p>and the pastures were covered with several inches of the most</p>
<p>fertile clay.</p>
<p>In Egypt a kindly river did the work of a million men and</p>
<p>made it possible to feed the teeming population of the first</p>
<p>large cities of which we have any record. It is true that all</p>
<p>the arable land was not in the valley. But a complicated</p>
<p>system of small canals and well-sweeps carried water from</p>
<p>the river-level to the top of the highest banks and an even</p>
<p>more intricate system of irrigation trenches spread it throughout</p>
<p>the land.</p>
<p>While man of the prehistoric age had been obliged to spend</p>
<p>sixteen hours out of every twenty-four gathering food for himself</p>
<p>and the members of his tribe, the Egyptian peasant or the</p>
<p>inhabitant of the Egyptian city found himself possessed of a</p>
<p>certain leisure. He used this spare time to make himself many</p>
<p>things that were merely ornamental and not in the least bit</p>
<p>useful.</p>
<p>More than that. One day he discovered that his brain was</p>
<p>capable of thinking all kinds of thoughts which had nothing</p>
<p>to do with the problems of eating and sleeping and finding a</p>
<p>home for the children. The Egyptian began to speculate upon</p>
<p>many strange problems that confronted him. Where did the</p>
<p>stars come from? Who made the noise of the thunder which</p>
<p>frightened him so terribly? Who made the River Nile rise</p>
<p>with such regularity that it was possible to base the calendar</p>
<p>upon the appearance and the disappearance of the annual</p>
<p>floods? Who was he, himself, a strange little creature surrounded</p>
<p>on all sides by death and sickness and yet happy and</p>
<p>full of laughter?</p>
<p>He asked these many questions and certain people obligingly</p>
<p>stepped forward to answer these inquiries to the best of</p>
<p>their ability. The Egyptians called them ``priests&#x27;&#x27; and they</p>
<p>became the guardians of his thoughts and gained great respect</p>
<p>in the community. They were highly learned men who were</p>
<p>entrusted with the sacred task of keeping the written records.</p>
<p>They understood that it is not good for man to think only of</p>
<p>his immediate advantage in this world and they drew his attention</p>
<p>to the days of the future when his soul would dwell</p>
<p>beyond the mountains of the west and must give an account</p>
<p>of his deeds to Osiris, the mighty God who was the Ruler of</p>
<p>the Living and the Dead and who judged the acts of men</p>
<p>according to their merits. Indeed, the priests made so much</p>
<p>of that future day in the realm of Isis and Osiris that the</p>
<p>Egyptians began to regard life merely as a short preparation</p>
<p>for the Hereafter and turned the teeming valley of the Nile</p>
<p>into a land devoted to the Dead.</p>
<p>In a strange way, the Egyptians had come to believe that</p>
<p>no soul could enter the realm of Osiris without the possession</p>
<p>of the body which had been its place of residence in this world.</p>
<p>Therefore as soon as a man was dead his relatives took his</p>
<p>corpse and had it embalmed. For weeks it was soaked in a</p>
<p>solution of natron and then it was filled with pitch. The</p>
<p>Persian word for pitch was ``Mumiai&#x27;&#x27; and the embalmed body</p>
<p>was called a ``Mummy.&#x27;&#x27; It was wrapped in yards and yards</p>
<p>of specially prepared linen and it was placed in a specially</p>
<p>prepared coffin ready to be removed to its final home. But</p>
<p>an Egyptian grave was a real home where the body was surrounded</p>
<p>by pieces of furniture and musical instruments (to</p>
<p>while away the dreary hours of waiting) and by little statues</p>
<p>of cooks and bakers and barbers (that the occupant of this</p>
<p>dark home might be decently provided with food and need not</p>
<p>go about unshaven).</p>
<p>Originally these graves had been dug into the rocks of the</p>
<p>western mountains but as the Egyptians moved northward</p>
<p>they were obliged to build their cemeteries in the desert. The</p>
<p>desert however is full of wild animals and equally wild robbers</p>
<p>and they broke into the graves and disturbed the mummy or</p>
<p>stole the jewelry that had been buried with the body. To prevent</p>
<p>such unholy desecration the Egyptians used to build small</p>
<p>mounds of stones on top of the graves. These little mounds</p>
<p>gradually grew in size, because the rich people built higher</p>
<p>mounds than the poor and there was a good deal of competition</p>
<p>to see who could make the highest hill of stones. The</p>
<p>record was made by King Khufu, whom the Greeks called</p>
<p>Cheops and who lived thirty centuries before our era. His</p>
<p>mound, which the Greeks called a pyramid (because the</p>
<p>Egyptian word for high was pir-em-us) was over five hundred</p>
<p>feet high.</p>
<p>It covered more than thirteen acres of desert which is three</p>
<p>times as much space as that occupied by the church of St.</p>
<p>Peter, the largest edifice of the Christian world.</p>
<p>During twenty years, over a hundred thousand men were</p>
<p>busy carrying the necessary stones from the other side of the</p>
<p>river--ferrying them across the Nile (how they ever managed</p>
<p>to do this, we do not understand), dragging them in many instances</p>
<p>a long distance across the desert and finally hoisting</p>
<p>them into their correct position. But so well did the King&#x27;s</p>
<p>architects and engineers perform their task that the narrow</p>
<p>passage-way which leads to the royal tomb in the heart of the</p>
<p>stone monster has never yet been pushed out of shape by the</p>
<p>weight of those thousands of tons of stone which press upon</p>
<p>it from all sides.</p>
<p>THE STORY OF EGYPT</p>
<p>THE RISE AND FALL OF EGYPT</p>
<p>THE river Nile was a kind friend but occasionally it was</p>
<p>a hard taskmaster. It taught the people who lived along its</p>
<p>banks the noble art of ``team-work.&#x27;&#x27; They depended upon</p>
<p>each other to build their irrigation trenches and keep their</p>
<p>dikes in repair. In this way they learned how to get along</p>
<p>with their neighbours and their mutual-benefit-association quite</p>
<p>easily developed into an organised state.</p>
<p>Then one man grew more powerful than most of his neighbours</p>
<p>and he became the leader of the community and their</p>
<p>commander-in-chief when the envious neighbours of western</p>
<p>Asia invaded the prosperous valley. In due course of time</p>
<p>he became their King and ruled all the land from the Mediterranean</p>
<p>to the mountains of the west.</p>
<p>But these political adventures of the old Pharaohs (the</p>
<p>word meant ``the Man who lived in the Big House&#x27;&#x27;) rarely</p>
<p>interested the patient and toiling peasant of the grain fields.</p>
<p>Provided he was not obliged to pay more taxes to his King</p>
<p>than he thought just, he accepted the rule of Pharaoh as he</p>
<p>accepted the rule of Mighty Osiris.</p>
<p>It was different however when a foreign invader came</p>
<p>and robbed him of his possessions. After twenty centuries of</p>
<p>independent life, a savage Arab tribe of shepherds, called the</p>
<p>Hyksos, attacked Egypt and for five hundred years they were</p>
<p>the masters of the valley of the Nile. They were highly un-</p>
<p>popular and great hate was also felt for the Hebrews who</p>
<p>came to the land of Goshen to find a shelter after their long</p>
<p>wandering through the desert and who helped the foreign</p>
<p>usurper by acting as his tax-gatherers and his civil servants.</p>
<p>But shortly after the year 1700 B.C. the people of Thebes</p>
<p>began a revolution and after a long struggle the Hyksos were</p>
<p>driven out of the country and Egypt was free once more.</p>
<p>A thousand years later, when Assyria conquered all of</p>
<p>western Asia, Egypt became part of the empire of Sardanapalus.</p>
<p>In the seventh century B.C. it became once more an</p>
<p>independent state which obeyed the rule of a king who lived in</p>
<p>the city of Sais in the Delta of the Nile. But in the year 525</p>
<p>B.C., Cambyses, the king of the Persians, took possession of</p>
<p>Egypt and in the fourth century B.C., when Persia was conquered</p>
<p>by Alexander the Great, Egypt too became a Macedonian</p>
<p>province. It regained a semblance of independence</p>
<p>when one of Alexander&#x27;s generals set himself up as king of a</p>
<p>new Egyptian state and founded the dynasty of the Ptolemies,</p>
<p>who resided in the newly built city of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Finally, in the year 89 B.C., the Romans came. The last</p>
<p>Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, tried her best to save the country.</p>
<p>Her beauty and charm were more dangerous to the Roman</p>
<p>generals than half a dozen Egyptian army corps. Twice she</p>
<p>was successful in her attacks upon the hearts of her Roman</p>
<p>conquerors. But in the year 30 B.C., Augustus, the nephew</p>
<p>and heir of Caesar, landed in Alexandria. He did not share</p>
<p>his late uncle&#x27;s admiration for the lovely princess. He destroyed</p>
<p>her armies, but spared her life that he might make her</p>
<p>march in his triumph as part of the spoils of war. When</p>
<p>Cleopatra heard of this plan, she killed herself by taking poison.</p>
<p>And Egypt became a Roman province.</p>
<p>MESOPOTAMIA</p>
<p>MESOPOTAMIA--THE SECOND CENTRE OF</p>
<p>EASTERN CIVILISATION</p>
<p>I AM going to take you to the top of the highest pyramid</p>
<p>and I am going to ask that you imagine yourself possessed</p>
<p>of the eyes of a hawk. Way, way off, in the distance, far</p>
<p>beyond the yellow sands of the desert, you will see something</p>
<p>green and shimmering. It is a valley situated between two</p>
<p>rivers. It is the Paradise of the Old Testament. It is the</p>
<p>land of mystery and wonder which the Greeks called Mesopotamia--</p>
<p>the ``country between the rivers.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The names of the two rivers are the Euphrates (which the</p>
<p>Babylonians called the Purattu) and the Tigris (which was</p>
<p>known as the Diklat). They begin their course amidst the</p>
<p>snows of the mountains of Armenia where Noah&#x27;s Ark found</p>
<p>a resting place and slowly they flow through the southern</p>
<p>plain until they reach the muddy banks of the Persian gulf.</p>
<p>They perform a very useful service. They turn the arid</p>
<p>regions of western Asia into a fertile garden.</p>
<p>The valley of the Nile had attracted people because it had</p>
<p>offered them food upon fairly easy terms. The ``land between</p>
<p>the rivers&#x27;&#x27; was popular for the same reason. It was a</p>
<p>country full of promise and both the inhabitants of the northern</p>
<p>mountains and the tribes which roamed through the</p>
<p>southern deserts tried to claim this territory as their own and</p>
<p>most exclusive possession. The constant rivalry between the</p>
<p>mountaineers and the desert-nomads led to endless warfare.</p>
<p>Only the strongest and the bravest could hope to survive and</p>
<p>that will explain why Mesopotamia became the home of a very</p>
<p>strong race of men who were capable of creating a civilisation</p>
<p>which was in every respect as important as that of Egypt.</p>
<p>THE SUMERIANS</p>
<p>THE SUMERIAN NAIL WRITERS, WHOSE CLAY</p>
<p>TABLETS TELL US THE STORY OF ASSYRIA</p>
<p>AND BABYLONIA, THE GREAT SEMITIC</p>
<p>MELTING-POT</p>
<p>THE fifteenth century was an age of great discoveries.</p>
<p>Columbus tried to find a way to the island of Kathay and</p>
<p>stumbled upon a new and unsuspected continent. An Austrian</p>
<p>bishop equipped an expedition which was to travel eastward</p>
<p>and find the home of the Grand Duke of Muscovy, a</p>
<p>voyage which led to complete failure, for Moscow was not</p>
<p>visited by western men until a generation later. Meanwhile</p>
<p>a certain Venetian by the name of Barbero had explored the</p>
<p>ruins of western Asia and had brought back reports of a most</p>
<p>curious language which he had found carved in the rocks of</p>
<p>the temples of Shiraz and engraved upon endless pieces of</p>
<p>baked clay.</p>
<p>But Europe was busy with many other things and it was</p>
<p>not until the end of the eighteenth century that the first</p>
<p>``cuneiform inscriptions&#x27;&#x27; (so-called because the letters were</p>
<p>wedge-shaped and wedge is called ``Cuneus&#x27;&#x27; in Latin) were</p>
<p>brought to Europe by a Danish surveyor, named Niebuhr.</p>
<p>Then it took thirty years before a patient German school-</p>
<p>master by the name of Grotefend had deciphered the first four</p>
<p>letters, the D, the A, the R and the SH, the name of the Persian</p>
<p>King Darius. And another twenty years had to go by</p>
<p>until a British officer, Henry Rawlinson, who found the famous</p>
<p>inscription of Behistun, gave us a workable key to the nail-</p>
<p>writing of western Asia.</p>
<p>Compared to the problem of deciphering these nail-writings,</p>
<p>the job of Champollion had been an easy one. The</p>
<p>Egyptians used pictures. But the Sumerians, the earliest</p>
<p>inhabitants of Mesopotamia, who had hit upon the idea of</p>
<p>scratching their words in tablets of clay, had discarded pictures</p>
<p>entirely and had evolved a system of V-shaped figures which</p>
<p>showed little connection with the pictures out of which they</p>
<p>had been developed. A few examples will show you what I</p>
<p>mean. In the beginning a star, when drawn with a nail into</p>
<p>a brick looked as follows: {illust.} This sign however was too</p>
<p>cumbersome and after a short while when the meaning of</p>
<p>``heaven&#x27;&#x27; was added to that of star the picture was simplified</p>
<p>in this way {illust.} which made it even more of a puzzle.</p>
<p>In the same way an ox changed from {illust} into {illust.}</p>
<p>and a fish changed from {illust.} into {illust.} The sun</p>
<p>was originally a plain circle {illust.} and became {illust.}</p>
<p>If we were using the Sumerian script today we would make an</p>
<p>{illust.} look like {illust.}. This system of writing down our</p>
<p>ideas looks rather complicated but for more than thirty centuries</p>
<p>it was used by the Sumerians and the Babylonians and</p>
<p>the Assyrians and the Persians and all the different races</p>
<p>which forced their way into the fertile valley.</p>
<p>The story of Mesopotamia is one of endless warfare and</p>
<p>conquest. First the Sumerians came from the North. They</p>
<p>were a white People who had lived in the mountains. They</p>
<p>had been accustomed to worship their Gods on the tops of</p>
<p>hills. After they had entered the plain they constructed artificial</p>
<p>little hills on top of which they built their altars. They</p>
<p>did not know how to build stairs and they therefore surrounded</p>
<p>their towers with sloping galleries. Our engineers</p>
<p>have borrowed this idea, as you may see in our big railroad</p>
<p>stations where ascending galleries lead from one floor to another.</p>
<p>We may have borrowed other ideas from the Sumerians</p>
<p>but we do not know it. The Sumerians were entirely ab-</p>
<p>sorbed by those races that entered the fertile valley at a later</p>
<p>date. Their towers however still stand amidst the ruins of</p>
<p>Mesopotamia. The Jews saw them when they went into exile</p>
<p>in the land of Babylon and they called them towers of BabIlli,</p>
<p>or towers of Babel.</p>
<p>In the fortieth century before our era, the Sumerians had</p>
<p>entered Mesopotamia. They were soon afterwards over-</p>
<p>powered by the Akkadians, one of the many tribes from the</p>
<p>desert of Arabia who speak a common dialect and who are</p>
<p>known as the ``Semites,&#x27;&#x27; because in the olden days people believed</p>
<p>them to be the direct descendants of Shem, one of the</p>
<p>three sons of Noah. A thousand years later, the Akkadians</p>
<p>were forced to submit to the rule of the Amorites, another</p>
<p>Semitic desert tribe whose great King Hammurabi built himself</p>
<p>a magnificent palace in the holy city of Babylon and who</p>
<p>gave his people a set of laws which made the Babylonian state</p>
<p>the best administered empire of the ancient world. Next the</p>
<p>Hittites, whom you will also meet in the Old Testament, over-</p>
<p>ran the Fertile Valley and destroyed whatever they could not</p>
<p>carry away. They in turn were vanquished by the followers</p>
<p>of the great desert God, Ashur, who called themselves Assyrians</p>
<p>and who made the city of Nineveh the center of a vast</p>
<p>and terrible empire which conquered all of western Asia and</p>
<p>Egypt and gathered taxes from countless subject races until</p>
<p>the end of the seventh century before the birth of Christ when</p>
<p>the Chaldeans, also a Semitic tribe, re-established Babylon and</p>
<p>made that city the most important capital of that day.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar, the best known of their Kings, encouraged</p>
<p>the study of science, and our modern knowledge of astronomy</p>
<p>and mathematics is all based upon certain first principles which</p>
<p>were discovered by the Chaldeans. In the year 538 B.C. a</p>
<p>crude tribe of Persian shepherds invaded this old land and</p>
<p>overthrew the empire of the Chaldeans. Two hundred years</p>
<p>later, they in turn were overthrown by Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>who turned the Fertile Valley, the old melting-pot of so many</p>
<p>Semitic races, into a Greek province. Next came the Romans</p>
<p>and after the Romans, the Turks, and Mesopotamia, the second</p>
<p>centre of the world&#x27;s civilisation, became a vast wilderness</p>
<p>where huge mounds of earth told a story of ancient glory.</p>
<p>MOSES</p>
<p>THE STORY OF MOSES, THE LEADER OF THE</p>
<p>JEWISH PEOPLE</p>
<p>SOME time during the twentieth century before our era,</p>
<p>a small and unimportant tribe of Semitic shepherds had left</p>
<p>its old home, which was situated in the land of Ur on the mouth</p>
<p>of the Euphrates, and had tried to find new pastures within</p>
<p>the domain of the Kings of Babylonia. They had been driven</p>
<p>away by the royal soldiers and they had moved westward</p>
<p>looking for a little piece of unoccupied territory where they</p>
<p>might set up their tents.</p>
<p>This tribe of shepherds was known as the Hebrews or, as</p>
<p>we call them, the Jews. They had wandered far and wide,</p>
<p>and after many years of dreary peregrinations they had been</p>
<p>given shelter in Egypt. For more than five centuries they</p>
<p>had dwelt among the Egyptians and when their adopted country</p>
<p>had been overrun by the Hyksos marauders (as I told</p>
<p>you in the story of Egypt) they had managed to make themselves</p>
<p>useful to the foreign invader and had been left in the</p>
<p>undisturbed possession of their grazing fields. But after a</p>
<p>long war of independence the Egyptians had driven the</p>
<p>Hyksos out of the valley of the Nile and then the Jews had</p>
<p>come upon evil times for they had been degraded to the rank</p>
<p>of common slaves and they had been forced to work on the</p>
<p>royal roads and on the Pyramids. And as the frontiers were</p>
<p>guarded by the Egyptian soldiers it had been impossible for</p>
<p>the Jews to escape.</p>
<p>After many years of suffering they were saved from their</p>
<p>miserable fate by a young Jew, called Moses, who for a long</p>
<p>time had dwelt in the desert and there had learned to appreciate</p>
<p>the simple virtues of his earliest ancestors, who had kept</p>
<p>away from cities and city-life and had refused to let themselves</p>
<p>be corrupted by the ease and the luxury of a foreign</p>
<p>civilisation.</p>
<p>Moses decided to bring his people back to a love of the ways</p>
<p>of the patriarchs. He succeeded in evading the Egyptian</p>
<p>troops that were sent after him and led his fellow tribesmen</p>
<p>into the heart of the plain at the foot of Mount Sinai. During</p>
<p>his long and lonely life in the desert, he had learned to</p>
<p>revere the strength of the great God of the Thunder and the</p>
<p>Storm, who ruled the high heavens and upon whom the shepherds</p>
<p>depended for life and light and breath. This God, one</p>
<p>of the many divinities who were widely worshipped in western</p>
<p>Asia, was called Jehovah, and through the teaching of Moses,</p>
<p>he became the sole Master of the Hebrew race.</p>
<p>One day, Moses disappeared from the camp of the Jews.</p>
<p>It was whispered that he had gone away carrying two tablets</p>
<p>of rough-hewn stone. That afternoon, the top of the mountain</p>
<p>was lost to sight. The darkness of a terrible storm hid it from</p>
<p>the eye of man. But when Moses returned, behold! there stood</p>
<p>engraved upon the tablets the words which Jehovah had spoken</p>
<p>unto the people of Israel amidst the crash of his thunder and</p>
<p>the blinding flashes of his lightning. And from that moment,</p>
<p>Jehovah was recognised by all the Jews as the Highest Master</p>
<p>of their Fate, the only True God, who had taught them how</p>
<p>to live holy lives when he bade them to follow the wise lessons</p>
<p>of his Ten Commandments.</p>
<p>They followed Moses when he bade them continue their</p>
<p>journey through the desert. They obeyed him when he told</p>
<p>them what to eat and drink and what to avoid that they might</p>
<p>keep well in the hot climate. And finally after many years of</p>
<p>wandering they came to a land which seemed pleasant and</p>
<p>prosperous. It was called Palestine, which means the country</p>
<p>of the ``Pilistu&#x27;&#x27; the Philistines, a small tribe of Cretans who</p>
<p>had settled along the coast after they had been driven away</p>
<p>from their own island. Unfortunately, the mainland, Palestine,</p>
<p>was already inhabited by another Semitic race, called the</p>
<p>Canaanites. But the Jews forced their way into the valleys</p>
<p>and built themselves cities and constructed a mighty temple</p>
<p>in a town which they named Jerusalem, the Home of Peace.</p>
<p>As for Moses, he was no longer the leader of his people. He</p>
<p>had been allowed to see the mountain ridges of Palestine from</p>
<p>afar. Then he had closed his tired eyes for all time. He had</p>
<p>worked faithfully and hard to please Jehovah. Not only had</p>
<p>he guided his brethren out of foreign slavery into the free and</p>
<p>independent life of a new home but he had also made the Jews</p>
<p>the first of all nations to worship a single God.</p>
<p>THE PHOENICIANS</p>
<p>THE PHOENICIANS WHO GAVE US OUR</p>
<p>ALPHABET</p>
<p>THE Phoenicians, who were the neighbours of the Jews,</p>
<p>were a Semitic tribe which at a very early age had settled along</p>
<p>the shores of the Mediterranean. They had built themselves</p>
<p>two well-fortified towns, Tyre and Sidon, and within a short</p>
<p>time they had gained a monopoly of the trade of the western</p>
<p>seas. Their ships went regularly to Greece and Italy and</p>
<p>Spain and they even ventured beyond the straits of Gibraltar</p>
<p>to visit the Scilly islands where they could buy tin. Wherever</p>
<p>they went, they built themselves small trading stations, which</p>
<p>they called colonies. Many of these were the origin of modern</p>
<p>cities, such as Cadiz and Marseilles.</p>
<p>They bought and sold whatever promised to bring them a</p>
<p>good profit. They were not troubled by a conscience. If we</p>
<p>are to believe all their neighbours they did not know what the</p>
<p>words honesty or integrity meant. They regarded a well-filled</p>
<p>treasure chest the highest ideal of all good citizens. Indeed</p>
<p>they were very unpleasant people and did not have a single</p>
<p>friend. Nevertheless they have rendered all coming generations</p>
<p>one service of the greatest possible value. They gave</p>
<p>us our alphabet.</p>
<p>The Phoenicians had been familiar with the art of writing,</p>
<p>invented by the Sumerians. But they regarded these pothooks</p>
<p>as a clumsy waste of time. They were practical business men</p>
<p>and could not spend hours engraving two or three letters.</p>
<p>They set to work and invented a new system of writing which</p>
<p>was greatly superior to the old one. They borrowed a few</p>
<p>pictures from the Egyptians and they simplified a number of</p>
<p>the wedge-shaped figures of the Sumerians. They sacrificed</p>
<p>the pretty looks of the older system for the advantage of speed</p>
<p>and they reduced the thousands of different images to a short</p>
<p>and handy alphabet of twenty-two letters.</p>
<p>In due course of time, this alphabet travelled across the</p>
<p>AEgean Sea and entered Greece. The Greeks added a few</p>
<p>letters of their own and carried the improved system to Italy.</p>
<p>The Romans modified the figures somewhat and in turn taught</p>
<p>them to the wild barbarians of western Europe. Those wild</p>
<p>barbarians were our own ancestors, and that is the reason why</p>
<p>this book is written in characters that are of Phoenician origin</p>
<p>and not in the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians or in the nail-</p>
<p>script of the Sumerians.</p>
<p>THE INDO-EUROPEANS</p>
<p>THE INDO-EUROPEAN PERSIANS CONQUER</p>
<p>THE SEMITIC AND THE EGYPTIAN</p>
<p>WORLD</p>
<p>THE world of Egypt and Babylon and Assyria and Phoenicia</p>
<p>had existed almost thirty centuries and the venerable</p>
<p>races of the Fertile Valley were getting old and tired. Their</p>
<p>doom was sealed when a new and more energetic race appeared</p>
<p>upon the horizon. We call this race the Indo-European race,</p>
<p>because it conquered not only Europe but also made itself the</p>
<p>ruling class in the country which is now known as British India.</p>
<p>These Indo-Europeans were white men like the Semites</p>
<p>but they spoke a different language which is regarded as the</p>
<p>common ancestor of all European tongues with the exception</p>
<p>of Hungarian and Finnish and the Basque dialects of Northern</p>
<p>Spain.</p>
<p>When we first hear of them, they had been living along the</p>
<p>shores of the Caspian Sea for many centuries. But one day</p>
<p>they had packed their tents and they had wandered forth in</p>
<p>search of a new home. Some of them had moved into the</p>
<p>mountains of Central Asia and for many centuries they had</p>
<p>lived among the peaks which surround the plateau of Iran and</p>
<p>that is why we call them Aryans. Others had followed the</p>
<p>setting sun and they had taken possession of the plains of</p>
<p>Europe as I shall tell you when I give you the story of Greece</p>
<p>and Rome.</p>
<p>For the moment we must follow the Aryans. Under the</p>
<p>leadership of Zarathustra (or Zoroaster) who was their great</p>
<p>teacher many of them had left their mountain homes to follow</p>
<p>the swiftly flowing Indus river on its way to the sea.</p>
<p>Others had preferred to stay among the hills of western</p>
<p>Asia and there they had founded the half-independent communities</p>
<p>of the Medes and the Persians, two peoples whose</p>
<p>names we have copied from the old Greek history-books. In</p>
<p>the seventh century before the birth of Christ, the Medes had</p>
<p>established a kingdom of their own called Media, but this</p>
<p>perished when Cyrus, the chief of a clan known as the Anshan,</p>
<p>made himself king of all the Persian tribes and started upon</p>
<p>a career of conquest which soon made him and his children the</p>
<p>undisputed masters of the whole of western Asia and of Egypt.</p>
<p>Indeed, with such energy did these Indo-European Persians</p>
<p>push their triumphant campaigns in the west that they soon</p>
<p>found themselves in serious difficulties with certain other Indo-</p>
<p>European tribes which centuries before had moved into Europe</p>
<p>and had taken possession of the Greek peninsula and the islands</p>
<p>of the AEgean Sea.</p>
<p>These difficulties led to the three famous wars between</p>
<p>Greece and Persia during which King Darius and King</p>
<p>Xerxes of Persia invaded the northern part of the peninsula.</p>
<p>They ravaged the lands of the Greeks and tried very hard to</p>
<p>get a foothold upon the European continent.</p>
<p>But in this they did not succeed. The navy of Athens</p>
<p>proved unconquerable. By cutting off the lines of supplies</p>
<p>of the Persian armies, the Greek sailors invariably forced the</p>
<p>Asiatic rulers to return to their base.</p>
<p>It was the first encounter between Asia, the ancient</p>
<p>teacher, and Europe, the young and eager pupil. A great</p>
<p>many of the other chapters of this book will tell you how the</p>
<p>struggle between east and west has continued until this very</p>
<p>day.</p>
<p>THE AEGEAN SEA</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE OF THE AEGEAN SEA CARRIED</p>
<p>THE CIVILISATION OF OLD ASIA INTO</p>
<p>THE WILDERNESS OF EUROPE</p>
<p>WHEN Heinrich Schliemann was a little boy his</p>
<p>father told him the story of Troy. He liked that story</p>
<p>better than anything else he had ever heard and he made</p>
<p>up his mind, that as soon as he was big enough to leave home,</p>
<p>he would travel to Greece and ``find Troy.&#x27;&#x27; That he was the</p>
<p>son of a poor country parson in a Mecklenburg village did</p>
<p>not bother him. He knew that he would need money but</p>
<p>he decided to gather a fortune first and do the digging afterwards.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he managed to get a large fortune</p>
<p>within a very short time, and as soon as he had enough money to</p>
<p>equip an expedition, he went to the northwest corner of Asia</p>
<p>Minor, where he supposed that Troy had been situated.</p>
<p>In that particular nook of old Asia Minor, stood a high</p>
<p>mound covered with grainfields. According to tradition it had</p>
<p>been the home of Priamus the king of Troy. Schliemann,</p>
<p>whose enthusiasm was somewhat greater than his knowledge,</p>
<p>wasted no time in preliminary explorations. At once he began</p>
<p>to dig. And he dug with such zeal and such speed that his</p>
<p>trench went straight through the heart of the city for which he</p>
<p>was looking and carried him to the ruins of another buried</p>
<p>town which was at least a thousand years older than the Troy</p>
<p>of which Homer had written. Then something very interesting</p>
<p>occurred. If Schliemann had found a few polished stone</p>
<p>hammers and perhaps a few pieces of crude pottery, no one</p>
<p>would have been surprised. Instead of discovering such objects,</p>
<p>which people had generally associated with the prehistoric</p>
<p>men who had lived in these regions before the coming of</p>
<p>the Greeks, Schliemann found beautiful statuettes and very</p>
<p>costly jewelry and ornamented vases of a pattern that was</p>
<p>unknown to the Greeks. He ventured the suggestion that</p>
<p>fully ten centuries before the great Trojan war, the coast of</p>
<p>the AEgean had been inhabited by a mysterious race of men</p>
<p>who in many ways had been the superiors of the wild Greek</p>
<p>tribes who had invaded their country and had destroyed their</p>
<p>civilisation or absorbed it until it had lost all trace of originality.</p>
<p>And this proved to be the case. In the late seventies of</p>
<p>the last century, Schliemann visited the ruins of Mycenae, ruins</p>
<p>which were so old that Roman guide-books marvelled at their</p>
<p>antiquity. There again, beneath the flat slabs of stone of a</p>
<p>small round enclosure, Schliemann stumbled upon a wonderful</p>
<p>treasure-trove, which had been left behind by those mysterious</p>
<p>people who had covered the Greek coast with their cities and</p>
<p>who had built walls, so big and so heavy and so strong, that</p>
<p>the Greeks called them the work of the Titans, those god-like</p>
<p>giants who in very olden days had used to play ball with</p>
<p>mountain peaks.</p>
<p>A very careful study of these many relics has done away</p>
<p>with some of the romantic features of the story. The makers</p>
<p>of these early works of art and the builders of these strong</p>
<p>fortresses were no sorcerers, but simple sailors and traders.</p>
<p>They had lived in Crete, and on the many small islands of the</p>
<p>AEgean Sea. They had been hardy mariners and they had</p>
<p>turned the AEgean into a center of commerce for the exchange</p>
<p>of goods between the highly civilised east and the slowly</p>
<p>developing wilderness of the European mainland.</p>
<p>For more than a thousand years they had maintained an</p>
<p>island empire which had developed a very high form of art.</p>
<p>Indeed their most important city, Cnossus, on the northern</p>
<p>coast of Crete, had been entirely modern in its insistence upon</p>
<p>hygiene and comfort. The palace had been properly drained</p>
<p>and the houses had been provided with stoves and the Cnossians</p>
<p>had been the first people to make a daily use of the hitherto</p>
<p>unknown bathtub. The palace of their King had been famous</p>
<p>for its winding staircases and its large banqueting hall. The</p>
<p>cellars underneath this palace, where the wine and the grain</p>
<p>and the olive-oil were stored, had been so vast and had so</p>
<p>greatly impressed the first Greek visitors, that they had given</p>
<p>rise to the story of the ``labyrinth,&#x27;&#x27; the name which we give</p>
<p>to a structure with so many complicated passages that it is</p>
<p>almost impossible to find our way out, once the front door has</p>
<p>closed upon our frightened selves.</p>
<p>But what finally became of this great AEgean Empire and</p>
<p>what caused its sudden downfall, that I can not tell.</p>
<p>The Cretans were familiar with the art of writing, but no</p>
<p>one has yet been able to decipher their inscriptions. Their</p>
<p>history therefore is unknown to us. We have to reconstruct</p>
<p>the record of their adventures from the ruins which the</p>
<p>AEgeans have left behind. These ruins make it clear that the</p>
<p>AEgean world was suddenly conquered by a less civilised race</p>
<p>which had recently come from the plains of northern Europe.</p>
<p>Unless we are very much mistaken, the savages who were</p>
<p>responsible for the destruction of the Cretan and the AEgean</p>
<p>civilisation were none other than certain tribes of wandering</p>
<p>shepherds who had just taken possession of the rocky peninsula</p>
<p>between the Adriatic and the AEgean seas and who are</p>
<p>known to us as Greeks.</p>
<p>THE GREEKS</p>
<p>MEANWHILE THE INDO-EUROPEAN TRIBE</p>
<p>OF THE HELLENES WAS TAKING</p>
<p>POSSESSION OF GREECE</p>
<p>THE Pyramids were a thousand years old and were beginning</p>
<p>to show the first signs of decay, and Hammurabi, the</p>
<p>wise king of Babylon, had been dead and buried several centuries,</p>
<p>when a small tribe of shepherds left their homes along</p>
<p>the banks of the River Danube and wandered southward in</p>
<p>search of fresh pastures. They called themselves Hellenes,</p>
<p>after Hellen, the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha. According</p>
<p>to the old myths these were the only two human beings who</p>
<p>had escaped the great flood, which countless years before had</p>
<p>destroyed all the people of the world, when they had grown</p>
<p>so wicked that they disgusted Zeus, the mighty God, who lived</p>
<p>on Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>Of these early Hellenes we know nothing. Thucydides,</p>
<p>the historian of the fall of Athens, describing his earliest</p>
<p>ancestors, said that they ``did not amount to very much,&#x27;&#x27; and</p>
<p>this was probably true. They were very ill-mannered. They</p>
<p>lived like pigs and threw the bodies of their enemies to the wild</p>
<p>dogs who guarded their sheep. They had very little respect</p>
<p>for other people&#x27;s rights, and they killed the natives of the</p>
<p>Greek peninsula (who were called the Pelasgians) and stole</p>
<p>their farms and took their cattle and made their wives and</p>
<p>daughters slaves and wrote endless songs praising the courage</p>
<p>of the clan of the Achaeans, who had led the Hellenic advance-</p>
<p>guard into the mountains of Thessaly and the Peloponnesus.</p>
<p>But here and there, on the tops of high rocks, they saw</p>
<p>the castles of the AEgeans and those they did not attack for</p>
<p>they feared the metal swords and the spears of the AEgean</p>
<p>soldiers and knew that they could not hope to defeat them with</p>
<p>their clumsy stone axes.</p>
<p>For many centuries they continued to wander from valley</p>
<p>to valley and from mountain side to mountain side Then the</p>
<p>whole of the land had been occupied and the migration had</p>
<p>come to an end.</p>
<p>That moment was the beginning of Greek civilisation. The</p>
<p>Greek farmer, living within sight of the AEgean colonies,</p>
<p>was finally driven by curiosity to visit his haughty neighbours.</p>
<p>He discovered that he could learn many useful things from</p>
<p>the men who dwelt behind the high stone walls of Mycenae, and</p>
<p>Tiryns.</p>
<p>He was a clever pupil. Within a short time he mastered</p>
<p>the art of handling those strange iron weapons which the</p>
<p>AEgeans had brought from Babylon and from Thebes. He</p>
<p>came to understand the mysteries of navigation. He began</p>
<p>to build little boats for his own use.</p>
<p>And when he had learned everything the AEgeans could</p>
<p>teach him he turned upon his teachers and drove them back</p>
<p>to their islands. Soon afterwards he ventured forth upon the</p>
<p>sea and conquered all the cities of the AEgean. Finally in the</p>
<p>fifteenth century before our era he plundered and ravaged</p>
<p>Cnossus and ten centuries after their first appearance upon</p>
<p>the scene the Hellenes were the undisputed rulers of Greece,</p>
<p>of the AEgean and of the coastal regions of Asia Minor. Troy,</p>
<p>the last great commercial stronghold of the older civilisation,</p>
<p>was destroyed in the eleventh century B.C. European history</p>
<p>was to begin in all seriousness.</p>
<p>THE GREEK CITIES</p>
<p>THE GREEK CITIES THAT WERE REALLY</p>
<p>STATES</p>
<p>WE modern people love the sound of the word ``big.&#x27;&#x27; We</p>
<p>pride ourselves upon the fact that we belong to the ``biggest&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>country in the world and possess the ``biggest&#x27;&#x27; navy and grow</p>
<p>the ``biggest&#x27;&#x27; oranges and potatoes, and we love to live in</p>
<p>cities of ``millions&#x27;&#x27; of inhabitants and when we are dead we</p>
<p>are buried in the ``biggest cemetery of the whole state.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>A citizen of ancient Greece, could he have heard us talk,</p>
<p>would not have known what we meant. ``Moderation in all</p>
<p>things&#x27;&#x27; was the ideal of his life and mere bulk did not impress</p>
<p>him at all. And this love of moderation was not merely a</p>
<p>hollow phrase used upon special occasions: it influenced the</p>
<p>life of the Greeks from the day of their birth to the hour of</p>
<p>their death. It was part of their literature and it made them</p>
<p>build small but perfect temples. It found expression in the</p>
<p>clothes which the men wore and in the rings and the bracelets</p>
<p>of their wives. It followed the crowds that went to the theatre</p>
<p>and made them hoot down any playwright who dared to</p>
<p>sin against the iron law of good taste or good sense.</p>
<p>The Greeks even insisted upon this quality in their politicians</p>
<p>and in their most popular athletes. When a powerful</p>
<p>runner came to Sparta and boasted that he could stand longer</p>
<p>on one foot than any other man in Hellas the people drove him</p>
<p>from the city because he prided himself upon an accomplish-</p>
<p>ment at which he could be beaten by any common goose.</p>
<p><code>That is all very well,&#x27;&#x27; you will say, </code>and no doubt it is a</p>
<p>great virtue to care so much for moderation and perfection,</p>
<p>but why should the Greeks have been the only people to develop</p>
<p>this quality in olden times?&#x27;&#x27; For an answer I shall</p>
<p>point to the way in which the Greeks lived.</p>
<p>The people of Egypt or Mesopotamia had been the ``subjects&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>of a mysterious Supreme Ruler who lived miles and</p>
<p>miles away in a dark palace and who was rarely seen by the</p>
<p>masses of the population. The Greeks on the other hand,</p>
<p>were <code>free citizens&#x27;&#x27; of a hundred independent little </code>cities&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>the largest of which counted fewer inhabitants than a large</p>
<p>modern village. When a peasant who lived in Ur said that he</p>
<p>was a Babylonian he meant that he was one of millions of</p>
<p>other people who paid tribute to the king who at that particular</p>
<p>moment happened to be master of western Asia. But when</p>
<p>a Greek said proudly that he was an Athenian or a Theban</p>
<p>he spoke of a small town, which was both his home and his</p>
<p>country and which recognised no master but the will of the</p>
<p>people in the market-place.</p>
<p>To the Greek, his fatherland was the place where he was</p>
<p>born; where he had spent his earliest years playing hide and</p>
<p>seek amidst the forbidden rocks of the Acropolis; where he had</p>
<p>grown into manhood with a thousand other boys and girls,</p>
<p>whose nicknames were as familiar to him as those of your own</p>
<p>schoolmates. His Fatherland was the holy soil where his father</p>
<p>and mother lay buried. It was the small house within the high</p>
<p>city-walls where his wife and children lived in safety. It was</p>
<p>a complete world which covered no more than four or five</p>
<p>acres of rocky land. Don&#x27;t you see how these surroundings</p>
<p>must have influenced a man in everything he did and said and</p>
<p>thought? The people of Babylon and Assyria and Egypt</p>
<p>had been part of a vast mob. They had been lost in the multitude.</p>
<p>The Greek on the other hand had never lost touch with</p>
<p>his immediate surroundings. He never ceased to be part of a</p>
<p>little town where everybody knew every one else. He felt</p>
<p>that his intelligent neighbours were watching him. Whatever</p>
<p>he did, whether he wrote plays or made statues out of marble</p>
<p>or composed songs, he remembered that his efforts were going</p>
<p>to be judged by all the free-born citizens of his home-town who</p>
<p>knew about such things. This knowledge forced him to strive</p>
<p>after perfection, and perfection, as he had been taught from</p>
<p>childhood, was not possible without moderation.</p>
<p>In this hard school, the Greeks learned to excel in many</p>
<p>things. They created new forms of government and new forms</p>
<p>of literature and new ideals in art which we have never been</p>
<p>able to surpass. They performed these miracles in little villages</p>
<p>that covered less ground than four or five modern city</p>
<p>blocks.</p>
<p>And look, what finally happened!</p>
<p>In the fourth century before our era, Alexander of Macedonia</p>
<p>conquered the world. As soon as he had done with</p>
<p>fighting, Alexander decided that he must bestow the benefits</p>
<p>of the true Greek genius upon all mankind. He took it away</p>
<p>from the little cities and the little villages and tried to make</p>
<p>it blossom and bear fruit amidst the vast royal residences of</p>
<p>his newly acquired Empire. But the Greeks, removed from</p>
<p>the familiar sight of their own temples, removed from the well-</p>
<p>known sounds and smells of their own crooked streets, at once</p>
<p>lost the cheerful joy and the marvellous sense of moderation</p>
<p>which had inspired the work of their hands and brains while</p>
<p>they laboured for the glory of their old city-states. They became</p>
<p>cheap artisans, content with second-rate work. The day</p>
<p>the little city-states of old Hellas lost their independence and</p>
<p>were forced to become part of a big nation, the old Greek spirit</p>
<p>died. And it has been dead ever since.</p>
<p>GREEK SELF-GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>THE GREEKS WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO</p>
<p>TRY THE DIFFICULT EXPERIMENT OF</p>
<p>SELF-GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>IN the beginning, all the Greeks had been equally rich and</p>
<p>equally poor. Every man had owned a certain number of</p>
<p>cows and sheep. His mud-hut had been his castle. He had</p>
<p>been free to come and go as he wished. Whenever it was necessary</p>
<p>to discuss matters of public importance, all the citizens</p>
<p>had gathered in the market-place. One of the older men of the</p>
<p>village was elected chairman and it was his duty to see that</p>
<p>everybody had a chance to express his views. In case of war,</p>
<p>a particularly energetic and self-confident villager was chosen</p>
<p>commander-in-chief, but the same people who had voluntarily</p>
<p>given this man the right to be their leader, claimed an equal</p>
<p>right to deprive him of his job, once the danger had been</p>
<p>averted.</p>
<p>But gradually the village had grown into a city. Some</p>
<p>people had worked hard and others had been lazy. A few</p>
<p>had been unlucky and still others had been just plain dishonest</p>
<p>in dealing with their neighbours and had gathered wealth.</p>
<p>As a result, the city no longer consisted of a number of men</p>
<p>who were equally well-off. On the contrary it was inhabited</p>
<p>by a small class of very rich people and a large class of very</p>
<p>poor ones.</p>
<p>There had been another change. The old commander-in-</p>
<p>chief who had been willingly recognised as ``headman&#x27;&#x27; or</p>
<p>``King&#x27;&#x27; because he knew how to lead his men to victory, had</p>
<p>disappeared from the scene. His place had been taken by the</p>
<p>nobles--a class of rich people who during the course of time</p>
<p>had got hold of an undue share of the farms and estates.</p>
<p>These nobles enjoyed many advantages over the common</p>
<p>crowd of freemen. They were able to buy the best weapons</p>
<p>which were to be found on the market of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>They had much spare time in which they could prac-</p>
<p>tise the art of fighting. They lived in strongly built houses</p>
<p>and they could hire soldiers to fight for them. They were</p>
<p>constantly quarrelling among each other to decide who should</p>
<p>rule the city. The victorious nobleman then assumed a sort of</p>
<p>Kingship over all his neighbours and governed the town until</p>
<p>he in turn was killed or driven away by still another ambitious</p>
<p>nobleman.</p>
<p>Such a King, by the grace of his soldiers, was called a</p>
<p>``Tyrant&#x27;&#x27; and during the seventh and sixth centuries before</p>
<p>our era every Greek city was for a time ruled by such Tyrants,</p>
<p>many of whom, by the way, happened to be exceedingly capa-</p>
<p>ble men. But in the long run, this state of affairs became</p>
<p>unbearable. Then attempts were made to bring about reforms</p>
<p>and out of these reforms grew the first democratic government</p>
<p>of which the world has a record.</p>
<p>It was early in the seventh century that the people of</p>
<p>Athens decided to do some housecleaning and give the large</p>
<p>number of freemen once more a voice in the government as</p>
<p>they were supposed to have had in the days of their Achaean</p>
<p>ancestors. They asked a man by the name of Draco to provide</p>
<p>them with a set of laws that would protect the poor against</p>
<p>the aggressions of the rich. Draco set to work. Unfortunately</p>
<p>he was a professional lawyer and very much out of touch</p>
<p>with ordinary life. In his eyes a crime was a crime and when</p>
<p>he had finished his code, the people of Athens discovered that</p>
<p>these Draconian laws were so severe that they could not</p>
<p>possibly be put into effect. There would not have been rope</p>
<p>enough to hang all the criminals under their new system of</p>
<p>jurisprudence which made the stealing of an apple a capital</p>
<p>offence.</p>
<p>The Athenians looked about for a more humane reformer.</p>
<p>At last they found some one who could do that sort of thing</p>
<p>better than anybody else. His name was Solon. He belonged</p>
<p>to a noble family and he had travelled all over the world and</p>
<p>had studied the forms of government of many other countries.</p>
<p>After a careful study of the subject, Solon gave Athens a set</p>
<p>of laws which bore testimony to that wonderful principle of</p>
<p>moderation which was part of the Greek character. He tried</p>
<p>to improve the condition of the peasant without however destroying</p>
<p>the prosperity of the nobles who were (or rather who</p>
<p>could be) of such great service to the state as soldiers. To protect</p>
<p>the poorer classes against abuse on the part of the judges</p>
<p>(who were always elected from the class of the nobles because</p>
<p>they received no salary) Solon made a provision whereby a</p>
<p>citizen with a grievance had the right to state his case before</p>
<p>a jury of thirty of his fellow Athenians.</p>
<p>Most important of all, Solon forced the average freeman</p>
<p>to take a direct and personal interest in the affairs of the city.</p>
<p>No longer could he stay at home and say ``oh, I am too busy</p>
<p>today&#x27;&#x27; or ``it is raining and I had better stay indoors.&#x27;&#x27; He</p>
<p>was expected to do his share; to be at the meeting of the town</p>
<p>council; and carry part of the responsibility for the safety and</p>
<p>the prosperity of the state.</p>
<p>This government by the ``demos,&#x27;&#x27; the people, was often far</p>
<p>from successful. There was too much idle talk. There were</p>
<p>too many hateful and spiteful scenes between rivals for official</p>
<p>honor. But it taught the Greek people to be independent and</p>
<p>to rely upon themselves for their salvation and that was a very</p>
<p>good thing.</p>
<p>GREEK LIFE</p>
<p>HOW THE GREEKS LIVED</p>
<p>BUT how, you will ask, did the ancient Greeks have time</p>
<p>to look after their families and their business if they were</p>
<p>forever running to the market-place to discuss affairs of state?</p>
<p>In this chapter I shall tell you.</p>
<p>In all matters of government, the Greek democracy recognised</p>
<p>only one class of citizens--the freemen. Every Greek</p>
<p>city was composed of a small number of free born citizens, a</p>
<p>large number of slaves and a sprinkling of foreigners.</p>
<p>At rare intervals (usually during a war, when men were</p>
<p>needed for the army) the Greeks showed themselves willing to</p>
<p>confer the rights of citizenship upon the ``barbarians&#x27;&#x27; as they</p>
<p>called the foreigners. But this was an exception. Citizenship</p>
<p>was a matter of birth. You were an Athenian because your</p>
<p>father and your grandfather had been Athenians before you.</p>
<p>But however great your merits as a trader or a soldier, if you</p>
<p>were born of non-Athenian parents, you remained a ``foreigner&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>until the end of time.</p>
<p>The Greek city, therefore, whenever it was not ruled by a</p>
<p>king or a tyrant, was run by and for the freemen, and this</p>
<p>would not have been possible without a large army of slaves</p>
<p>who outnumbered the free citizens at the rate of six or five</p>
<p>to one and who performed those tasks to which we modern</p>
<p>people must devote most of our time and energy if we wish to</p>
<p>provide for our families and pay the rent of our apartments.</p>
<p>The slaves did all the cooking and baking and candlestick</p>
<p>making of the entire city. They were the tailors and the carpenters</p>
<p>and the jewelers and the school-teachers and the bookkeepers</p>
<p>and they tended the store and looked after the factory</p>
<p>while the master went to the public meeting to discuss questions</p>
<p>of war and peace or visited the theatre to see the latest</p>
<p>play of AEschylus or hear a discussion of the revolutionary ideas</p>
<p>of Euripides, who had dared to express certain doubts upon</p>
<p>the omnipotence of the great god Zeus.</p>
<p>Indeed, ancient Athens resembled a modem club. All the</p>
<p>freeborn citizens were hereditary members and all the slaves</p>
<p>were hereditary servants, and waited upon the needs of their</p>
<p>masters, and it was very pleasant to be a member of the</p>
<p>organisation.</p>
<p>But when we talk about slaves. we do not mean the sort of</p>
<p>people about whom you have read in the pages of ``Uncle</p>
<p>Tom&#x27;s Cabin.&#x27;&#x27; It is true that the position of those slaves who</p>
<p>tilled the fields was a very unpleasant one, but the average</p>
<p>freeman who had come down in the world and who had been</p>
<p>obliged to hire himself out as a farm hand led just as miserable</p>
<p>a life. In the cities, furthermore, many of the slaves were</p>
<p>more prosperous than the poorer classes of the freemen. For</p>
<p>the Greeks, who loved moderation in all things, did not like to</p>
<p>treat their slaves after the fashion which afterward was so</p>
<p>common in Rome, where a slave had as few rights as an engine</p>
<p>in a modern factory and could be thrown to the wild animals</p>
<p>upon the smallest pretext.</p>
<p>The Greeks accepted slavery as a necessary institution,</p>
<p>without which no city could possibly become the home of a truly</p>
<p>civilised people.</p>
<p>The slaves also took care of those tasks which nowadays are</p>
<p>performed by the business men and the professional men. As</p>
<p>for those household duties which take up so much of the time</p>
<p>of your mother and which worry your father when he comes</p>
<p>home from his office, the Greeks, who understood the value of</p>
<p>leisure, had reduced such duties to the smallest possible minimum</p>
<p>by living amidst surroundings of extreme simplicity.</p>
<p>To begin with, their homes were very plain. Even the rich</p>
<p>nobles spent their lives in a sort of adobe barn, which lacked</p>
<p>all the comforts which a modern workman expects as his natural</p>
<p>right. A Greek home consisted of four walls and a roof.</p>
<p>There was a door which led into the street but there were no</p>
<p>windows. The kitchen, the living rooms and the sleeping quarters</p>
<p>were built around an open courtyard in which there was a</p>
<p>small fountain, or a statue and a few plants to make it look</p>
<p>bright. Within this courtyard the family lived when it did not</p>
<p>rain or when it was not too cold. In one corner of the yard the</p>
<p>cook (who was a slave) prepared the meal and in another</p>
<p>corner, the teacher (who was also a slave) taught the children</p>
<p>the alpha beta gamma and the tables of multiplication and in</p>
<p>still another corner the lady of the house, who rarely left her</p>
<p>domain (since it was not considered good form for a married</p>
<p>woman to be seen on the street too often) was repairing her</p>
<p>husband&#x27;s coat with her seamstresses (who were slaves,) and</p>
<p>in the little office, right off the door, the master was inspecting</p>
<p>the accounts which the overseer of his farm (who was a slave)</p>
<p>had just brought to him.</p>
<p>When dinner was ready the family came together but the</p>
<p>meal was a very simple one and did not take much time. The</p>
<p>Greeks seem to have regarded eating as an unavoidable evil</p>
<p>and not a pastime, which kills many dreary hours and eventually</p>
<p>kills many dreary people. They lived on bread and on</p>
<p>wine, with a little meat and some green vegetables. They</p>
<p>drank water only when nothing else was available because</p>
<p>they did not think it very healthy. They loved to call on each</p>
<p>other for dinner, but our idea of a festive meal, where everybody</p>
<p>is supposed to eat much more than is good for him, would</p>
<p>have disgusted them. They came together at the table for</p>
<p>the purpose of a good talk and a good glass of wine and water,</p>
<p>but as they were moderate people they despised those who</p>
<p>drank too much.</p>
<p>The same simplicity which prevailed in the dining room</p>
<p>also dominated their choice of clothes. They liked to be clean</p>
<p>and well groomed, to have their hair and beards neatly cut,</p>
<p>to feel their bodies strong with the exercise and the swimming</p>
<p>of the gymnasium, but they never followed the Asiatic fashion</p>
<p>which prescribed loud colours and strange patterns. They</p>
<p>wore a long white coat and they managed to look as smart as</p>
<p>a modern Italian officer in his long blue cape.</p>
<p>They loved to see their wives wear ornaments but they</p>
<p>thought it very vulgar to display their wealth (or their wives)</p>
<p>in public and whenever the women left their home they were as</p>
<p>inconspicuous as possible.</p>
<p>In short, the story of Greek life is a story not only of moderation</p>
<p>but also of simplicity. ``Things,&#x27;&#x27; chairs and tables and</p>
<p>books and houses and carriages, are apt to take up a great</p>
<p>deal of their owner&#x27;s time. In the end they invariably make</p>
<p>him their slave and his hours are spent looking after their</p>
<p>wants, keeping them polished and brushed and painted. The</p>
<p>Greeks, before everything else, wanted to be ``free,&#x27;&#x27; both in</p>
<p>mind and in body. That they might maintain their liberty, and</p>
<p>be truly free in spirit, they reduced their daily needs to the</p>
<p>lowest possible point.</p>
<p>THE GREEK THEATRE</p>
<p>THE ORIGINS OF THE THEATRE, THE FIRST</p>
<p>FORM OF PUBLIC AMUSEMENT</p>
<p>AT a very early stage of their history the Greeks had begun</p>
<p>to collect the poems, which had been written in honor of</p>
<p>their brave ancestors who had driven the Pelasgians out of</p>
<p>Hellas and had destroyed the power of Troy. These poems were</p>
<p>recited in public and everybody came to listen to them. But</p>
<p>the theatre, the form of entertainment which has become almost</p>
<p>a necessary part of our own lives, did not grow out of these</p>
<p>recited heroic tales. It had such a curious origin that I must</p>
<p>tell you something about it in a separate chapter</p>
<p>The Greeks had always been fond of parades. Every</p>
<p>year they held solemn processions in honor of Dionysos the</p>
<p>God of the wine. As everybody in Greece drank wine (the</p>
<p>Greeks thought water only useful for the purpose of swimming</p>
<p>and sailing) this particular Divinity was as popular as a God</p>
<p>of the Soda-Fountain would be in our own land.</p>
<p>And because the Wine-God was supposed to live in the</p>
<p>vineyards, amidst a merry mob of Satyrs (strange creatures</p>
<p>who were half man and half goat), the crowd that joined the</p>
<p>procession used to wear goat-skins and to hee-haw like real</p>
<p>billy-goats. The Greek word for goat is ``tragos&#x27;&#x27; and the</p>
<p>Greek word for singer is ``oidos.&#x27;&#x27; The singer who meh-mehed</p>
<p>like a goat therefore was called a ``tragos-oidos&#x27;&#x27; or goat singer,</p>
<p>and it is this strange name which developed into the modern</p>
<p>word ``Tragedy,&#x27;&#x27; which means in the theatrical sense a piece</p>
<p>with an unhappy ending, just as Comedy (which really means</p>
<p>the singing of something ``comos&#x27;&#x27; or gay) is the name given</p>
<p>to a play which ends happily.</p>
<p>But how, you will ask, did this noisy chorus of masqueraders,</p>
<p>stamping around like wild goats, ever develop into the</p>
<p>noble tragedies which have filled the theatres of the world for</p>
<p>almost two thousand years?</p>
<p>The connecting link between the goat-singer and Hamlet is</p>
<p>really very simple as I shall show you in a moment.</p>
<p>The singing chorus was very amusing in the beginning and</p>
<p>attracted large crowds of spectators who stood along the side</p>
<p>of the road and laughed. But soon this business of tree-hawing</p>
<p>grew tiresome and the Greeks thought dullness an evil only</p>
<p>comparable to ugliness or sickness. They asked for something</p>
<p>more entertaining. Then an inventive young poet from</p>
<p>the village of Icaria in Attica hit upon a new idea which proved</p>
<p>a tremendous success. He made one of the members of the</p>
<p>goat-chorus step forward and engage in conversation with the</p>
<p>leader of the musicians who marched at the head of the parade</p>
<p>playing upon their pipes of Pan. This individual was allowed</p>
<p>to step out of line. He waved his arms and gesticulated</p>
<p>while he spoke (that is to say he ``acted&#x27;&#x27; while the others merely</p>
<p>stood by and sang) and he asked a lot of questions, which the</p>
<p>bandmaster answered according to the roll of papyrus upon</p>
<p>which the poet had written down these answers before the</p>
<p>show began.</p>
<p>This rough and ready conversation--the dialogue--which</p>
<p>told the story of Dionysos or one of the other Gods, became</p>
<p>at once popular with the crowd. Henceforth every Dionysian</p>
<p>procession had an <code>acted scene&#x27;&#x27; and very soon the </code>acting&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>was considered more important than the procession and the</p>
<p>meh-mehing.</p>
<p>AEschylus, the most successful of all ``tragedians&#x27;&#x27; who wrote</p>
<p>no less than eighty plays during his long life (from 526 to 455)</p>
<p>made a bold step forward when he introduced two ``actors&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>instead of one. A generation later Sophocles increased the</p>
<p>number of actors to three. When Euripides began to write</p>
<p>his terrible tragedies in the middle of the fifth century, B.C.,</p>
<p>he was allowed as many actors as he liked and when Aristophanes</p>
<p>wrote those famous comedies in which he poked fun at</p>
<p>everybody and everything, including the Gods of Mount Olympus,</p>
<p>the chorus had been reduced to the role of mere bystanders</p>
<p>who were lined up behind the principal performers</p>
<p>and who sang ``this is a terrible world&#x27;&#x27; while the hero in the</p>
<p>foreground committed a crime against the will of the Gods.</p>
<p>This new form of dramatic entertainment demanded a</p>
<p>proper setting, and soon every Greek city owned a theatre, cut</p>
<p>out of the rock of a nearby hill. The spectators sat upon</p>
<p>wooden benches and faced a wide circle (our present orchestra</p>
<p>where you pay three dollars and thirty cents for a seat).</p>
<p>Upon this half-circle, which was the stage, the actors and the</p>
<p>chorus took their stand. Behind them there was a tent where</p>
<p>they made up with large clay masks which hid their faces and</p>
<p>which showed the spectators whether the actors were supposed</p>
<p>to be happy and smiling or unhappy and weeping. The Greek</p>
<p>word for tent is ``skene&#x27;&#x27; and that is the reason why we talk</p>
<p>of the ``scenery&#x27;&#x27; of the stage.</p>
<p>When once the tragedy had become part of Greek life, the</p>
<p>people took it very seriously and never went to the theatre to</p>
<p>give their minds a vacation. A new play became as important</p>
<p>an event as an election and a successful playwright was</p>
<p>received with greater honors than those bestowed upon a general</p>
<p>who had just returned from a famous victory.</p>
<p>THE PERSIAN WARS</p>
<p>HOW THE GREEKS DEFENDED EUROPE</p>
<p>AGAINST ASIATIC INVASION AND DROVE</p>
<p>THE PERSIANS BACK ACROSS THE AEGEAN</p>
<p>SEA</p>
<p>THE Greeks had learned the art of trading from the</p>
<p>AEgeans who had been the pupils of the Phoenicians. They</p>
<p>had founded colonies after the Phoenician pattern. They had</p>
<p>even improved upon the Phoenician methods by a more general</p>
<p>use of money in dealing with foreign customers. In the sixth</p>
<p>century before our era they had established themselves firmly</p>
<p>along the coast of Asia Minor and they were taking away</p>
<p>trade from the Phoenicians at a fast rate. This the Phoenicians</p>
<p>of course did not like but they were not strong enough to</p>
<p>risk a war with their Greek competitors. They sat and waited</p>
<p>nor did they wait in vain.</p>
<p>In a former chapter, I have told you how a humble tribe</p>
<p>of Persian shepherds had suddenly gone upon the warpath and</p>
<p>had conquered the greater part of western Asia. The Persians</p>
<p>were too civilised to plunder their new subjects. They</p>
<p>contented themselves with a yearly tribute. When they</p>
<p>reached the coast of Asia Minor they insisted that the Greek</p>
<p>colonies of Lydia recognize the Persian Kings as their over-</p>
<p>Lords and pay them a stipulated tax. The Greek colonies</p>
<p>objected. The Persians insisted. Then the Greek colonies</p>
<p>appealed to the home-country and the stage was set for a</p>
<p>quarrel.</p>
<p>For if the truth be told, the Persian Kings regarded the</p>
<p>Greek city-states as very dangerous political institutions and</p>
<p>bad examples for all other people who were supposed to be the</p>
<p>patient slaves of the mighty Persian Kings.</p>
<p>Of course, the Greeks enjoyed a certain degree of safety because</p>
<p>their country lay hidden beyond the deep waters of the</p>
<p>AEgean. But here their old enemies, the Phoenicians, stepped</p>
<p>forward with offers of help and advice to the Persians. If the</p>
<p>Persian King would provide the soldiers, the Phoenicians would</p>
<p>guarantee to deliver the necessary ships to carry them to</p>
<p>Europe. It was the year 492 before the birth of Christ, and</p>
<p>Asia made ready to destroy the rising power of Europe.</p>
<p>As a final warning the King of Persia sent messengers</p>
<p>to the Greeks asking for ``earth and water&#x27;&#x27; as a token of their</p>
<p>submission. The Greeks promptly threw the messengers into</p>
<p>the nearest well where they would find both ``earth and water&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>in large abundance and thereafter of course peace was impossible.</p>
<p>But the Gods of High Olympus watched over their children</p>
<p>and when the Phoenician fleet carrying the Persian troops</p>
<p>was near Mount Athos, the Storm-God blew his cheeks until</p>
<p>he almost burst the veins of his brow, and the fleet was destroyed</p>
<p>by a terrible hurricane and the Persians were all</p>
<p>drowned.</p>
<p>Two years later they returned. This time they sailed</p>
<p>straight across the AEgean Sea and landed near the village of</p>
<p>Marathon. As soon as the Athenians heard this they sent</p>
<p>their army of ten thousand men to guard the hills that</p>
<p>surrounded the Marathonian plain. At the same time they</p>
<p>despatched a fast runner to Sparta to ask for help. But Sparta</p>
<p>was envious of the fame of Athens and refused to come to her</p>
<p>assistance. The other Greek cities followed her example with</p>
<p>the exception of tiny Plataea which sent a thousand men. On</p>
<p>the twelfth of September of the year 490, Miltiades, the Athenian</p>
<p>commander, threw this little army against the hordes of the</p>
<p>Persians. The Greeks broke through the Persian barrage of</p>
<p>arrows and their spears caused terrible havoc among the disorganised</p>
<p>Asiatic troops who had never been called upon to resist</p>
<p>such an enemy.</p>
<p>That night the people of Athens watched the sky grow</p>
<p>red with the flames of burning ships. Anxiously they waited</p>
<p>for news. At last a little cloud of dust appeared upon the</p>
<p>road that led to the North. It was Pheidippides, the runner.</p>
<p>He stumbled and gasped for his end was near. Only a few</p>
<p>days before had he returned from his errand to Sparta. He</p>
<p>had hastened to join Miltiades. That morning he had taken</p>
<p>part in the attack and later he had volunteered to carry the</p>
<p>news of victory to his beloved city. The people saw him fall</p>
<p>and they rushed forward to support him. ``We have won,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>he whispered and then he died, a glorious death which made him</p>
<p>envied of all men.</p>
<p>As for the Persians, they tried, after this defeat, to land</p>
<p>near Athens but they found the coast guarded and disappeared,</p>
<p>and once more the land of Hellas was at peace.</p>
<p>Eight years they waited and during this time the Greeks</p>
<p>were not idle. They knew that a final attack was to be expected</p>
<p>but they did not agree upon the best way to avert the danger.</p>
<p>Some people wanted to increase the army. Others said that</p>
<p>a strong fleet was necessary for success. The two parties led by</p>
<p>Aristides (for the army) and Themistocles (the leader of the</p>
<p>bigger-navy men) fought each other bitterly and nothing was</p>
<p>done until Aristides was exiled. Then Themistocles had his</p>
<p>chance and he built all the ships he could and turned the Piraeus</p>
<p>into a strong naval base.</p>
<p>In the year 481 B.C. a tremendous Persian army appeared</p>
<p>in Thessaly, a province of northern Greece. In this hour of</p>
<p>danger, Sparta, the great military city of Greece, was elected</p>
<p>commander-in-chief. But the Spartans cared little what happened</p>
<p>to northern Greece provided their own country was not</p>
<p>invaded, They neglected to fortify the passes that led into</p>
<p>Greece.</p>
<p>A small detachment of Spartans under Leonidas had been</p>
<p>told to guard the narrow road between the high mountains and</p>
<p>the sea which connected Thessaly with the southern provinces.</p>
<p>Leonidas obeyed his orders. He fought and held the pass with</p>
<p>unequalled bravery. But a traitor by the name of Ephialtes</p>
<p>who knew the little byways of Malis guided a regiment of Persians</p>
<p>through the hills and made it possible for them to attack</p>
<p>Leonidas in the rear. Near the Warm Wells--the Thermopylae</p>
<p>--a terrible battle was fought.</p>
<p>When night came Leonidas and his faithful soldiers lay dead</p>
<p>under the corpses of their enemies.</p>
<p>But the pass had been lost and the greater part of Greece</p>
<p>fell into the hands of the Persians. They marched upon</p>
<p>Athens, threw the garrison from the rocks of the Acropolis and</p>
<p>burned the city. The people fled to the Island of Salamis. All</p>
<p>seemed lost. But on the 20th of September of the year 480</p>
<p>Themistocles forced the Persian fleet to give battle within the</p>
<p>narrow straits which separated the Island of Salamis from the</p>
<p>mainland and within a few hours he destroyed three quarters</p>
<p>of the Persian ships.</p>
<p>In this way the victory of Thermopylae came to naught.</p>
<p>Xerxes was forced to retire. The next year, so he decreed,</p>
<p>would bring a final decision. He took his troops to Thessaly</p>
<p>and there he waited for spring.</p>
<p>But this time the Spartans understood the seriousness of</p>
<p>the hour. They left the safe shelter of the wall which they had</p>
<p>built across the isthmus of Corinth and under the leadership</p>
<p>of Pausanias they marched against Mardonius the Persian</p>
<p>general. The united Greeks (some one hundred thousand men</p>
<p>from a dozen different cities) attacked the three hundred thou-</p>
<p>sand men of the enemy near Plataea. Once more the heavy</p>
<p>Greek infantry broke through the Persian barrage of arrows.</p>
<p>The Persians were defeated, as they had been at Marathon, and</p>
<p>this time they left for good. By a strange coincidence, the</p>
<p>same day that the Greek armies won their victory near Plataea,</p>
<p>the Athenian ships destroyed the enemy&#x27;s fleet near Cape Mycale</p>
<p>in Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Thus did the first encounter between Asia and Europe end.</p>
<p>Athens had covered herself with glory and Sparta had fought</p>
<p>bravely and well. If these two cities had been able to come to</p>
<p>an agreement, if they had been willing to forget their little</p>
<p>jealousies, they might have become the leaders of a strong and</p>
<p>united Hellas.</p>
<p>But alas, they allowed the hour of victory and enthusiasm</p>
<p>to slip by, and the same opportunity never returned.</p>
<p>ATHENS vs. SPARTA</p>
<p>HOW ATHENS AND SPARTA FOUGHT A LONG</p>
<p>AND DISASTROUS WAR FOR THE LEADERSHIP</p>
<p>OF GREECE</p>
<p>ATHENS and Sparta were both Greek cities and their people</p>
<p>spoke a common language. In every other respect they were</p>
<p>different. Athens rose high from the plain. It was a city</p>
<p>exposed to the fresh breezes from the sea, willing to look at</p>
<p>the world with the eyes of a happy child. Sparta, on the other</p>
<p>hand, was built at the bottom of a deep valley, and used the</p>
<p>surrounding mountains as a barrier against foreign thought.</p>
<p>Athens was a city of busy trade. Sparta was an armed camp</p>
<p>where people were soldiers for the sake of being soldiers. The</p>
<p>people of Athens loved to sit in the sun and discuss poetry or</p>
<p>listen to the wise words of a philosopher. The Spartans, on the</p>
<p>other hand, never wrote a single line that was considered literature,</p>
<p>but they knew how to fight, they liked to fight, and they</p>
<p>sacrificed all human emotions to their ideal of military preparedness.</p>
<p>No wonder that these sombre Spartans viewed the success</p>
<p>of Athens with malicious hate. The energy which the defence of</p>
<p>the common home had developed in Athens was now used for</p>
<p>purposes of a more peaceful nature. The Acropolis was rebuilt</p>
<p>and was made into a marble shrine to the Goddess Athena.</p>
<p>Pericles, the leader of the Athenian democracy, sent far and</p>
<p>wide to find famous sculptors and painters and scientists to</p>
<p>make the city more beautiful and the young Athenians more</p>
<p>worthy of their home. At the same time he kept a watchful</p>
<p>eye on Sparta and built high walls which connected Athens</p>
<p>with the sea and made her the strongest fortress of that day.</p>
<p>An insignificant quarrel between two little Greek cities led</p>
<p>to the final conflict. For thirty years the war between Athens</p>
<p>and Sparta continued. It ended in a terrible disaster for</p>
<p>Athens.</p>
<p>During the third year of the war the plague had entered</p>
<p>the city. More than half of the people and Pericles, the great</p>
<p>leader, had been killed. The plague was followed by a period</p>
<p>of bad and untrustworthy leadership. A brilliant young fellow</p>
<p>by the name of Alcibiades had gained the favor of the</p>
<p>popular assembly. He suggested a raid upon the Spartan</p>
<p>colony of Syracuse in Sicily. An expedition was equipped and</p>
<p>everything was ready. But Alcibiades got mixed up in a street</p>
<p>brawl and was forced to flee. The general who succeeded him</p>
<p>was a bungler. First he lost his ships and then he lost his</p>
<p>army, and the few surviving Athenians were thrown into the</p>
<p>stone-quarries of Syracuse, where they died from hunger and</p>
<p>thirst.</p>
<p>The expedition had killed all the young men of Athens.</p>
<p>The city was doomed. After a long siege the town surrendered</p>
<p>in April of the year 404. The high walls were demolished.</p>
<p>The navy was taken away by the Spartans. Athens ceased to</p>
<p>exist as the center of the great colonial empire which it had</p>
<p>conquered during the days of its prosperity. But that wonderful</p>
<p>desire to learn and to know and to investigate which</p>
<p>had distinguished her free citizens during the days of greatness</p>
<p>and prosperity did not perish with the walls and the</p>
<p>ships. It continued to live. It became even more brilliant.</p>
<p>Athens no longer shaped the destinies of the land of Greece.</p>
<p>But now, as the home of the first great university the city began</p>
<p>to influence the minds of intelligent people far beyond</p>
<p>the narrow frontiers of Hellas.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER THE GREAT</p>
<p>ALEXANDER THE MACEDONIAN ESTABLISHES</p>
<p>A GREEK WORLD-EMPIRE, AND</p>
<p>WHAT BECAME OF THIS HIGH AMBITION</p>
<p>WHEN the Achaeans had left their homes along the banks of</p>
<p>the Danube to look for pastures new, they had spent some</p>
<p>time among the mountains of Macedonia. Ever since, the</p>
<p>Greeks had maintained certain more or less formal relations</p>
<p>with the people of this northern country. The Macedonians</p>
<p>from their side had kept themselves well informed about conditions</p>
<p>in Greece.</p>
<p>Now it happened, just when Sparta and Athens had finished</p>
<p>their disastrous war for the leadership of Hellas, that</p>
<p>Macedonia was ruled by an extraordinarily clever man by</p>
<p>the name of Philip. He admired the Greek spirit in letters and</p>
<p>art but he despised the Greek lack of self-control in political</p>
<p>affairs. It irritated him to see a perfectly good people waste its</p>
<p>men and money upon fruitless quarrels. So he settled the</p>
<p>difficulty by making himself the master of all Greece and then</p>
<p>he asked his new subjects to join him on a voyage which he</p>
<p>meant to pay to Persia in return for the visit which Xerxes</p>
<p>had paid the Greeks one hundred and fifty years before.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Philip was murdered before he could start</p>
<p>upon this well-prepared expedition. The task of avenging the</p>
<p>destruction of Athens was left to Philip&#x27;s son Alexander, the</p>
<p>beloved pupil of Aristotle, wisest of all Greek teachers.</p>
<p>Alexander bade farewell to Europe in the spring of the</p>
<p>year 334 B.C. Seven years later he reached India. In the</p>
<p>meantime he had destroyed Phoenicia, the old rival of the Greek</p>
<p>merchants. He had conquered Egypt and had been worshipped</p>
<p>by the people of the Nile valley as the son and heir of the</p>
<p>Pharaohs. He had defeated the last Persian king--he had</p>
<p>overthrown the Persian empire he had given orders to rebuild</p>
<p>Babylon--he had led his troops into the heart of the</p>
<p>Himalayan mountains and had made the entire world a Macedonian</p>
<p>province and dependency. Then he stopped and announced</p>
<p>even more ambitious plans.</p>
<p>The newly formed Empire must be brought under the influence</p>
<p>of the Greek mind. The people must be taught the Greek</p>
<p>language--they must live in cities built after a Greek model.</p>
<p>The Alexandrian soldier now turned school-master. The military</p>
<p>camps of yesterday became the peaceful centres of the</p>
<p>newly imported Greek civilisation. Higher and higher did the</p>
<p>flood of Greek manners and Greek customs rise, when suddenly</p>
<p>Alexander was stricken with a fever and died in the old</p>
<p>palace of King Hammurabi of Babylon in the year 323.</p>
<p>Then the waters receded. But they left behind the fertile clay</p>
<p>of a higher civilisation and Alexander, with all his childish</p>
<p>ambitions and his silly vanities, had performed a most valuable</p>
<p>service. His Empire did not long survive him. A number of</p>
<p>ambitious generals divided the territory among themselves.</p>
<p>But they too remained faithful to the dream of a great world</p>
<p>brotherhood of Greek and Asiatic ideas and knowledge.</p>
<p>They maintained their independence until the Romans</p>
<p>added western Asia and Egypt to their other domains. The</p>
<p>strange inheritance of this Hellenistic civilisation (part Greek,</p>
<p>part Persian, part Egyptian and Babylonian) fell to the</p>
<p>Roman conquerors. During the following centuries, it got</p>
<p>such a firm hold upon the Roman world, that we feel its influence</p>
<p>in our own lives this very day.</p>
<p>A SUMMARY</p>
<p>A SHORT SUMMARY OF CHAPTERS 1 to 20</p>
<p>THUS far, from the top of our high tower we have been</p>
<p>looking eastward. But from this time on, the history of Egypt</p>
<p>and Mesopotamia is going to grow less interesting and I must</p>
<p>take you to study the western landscape.</p>
<p>Before we do this, let us stop a moment and make clear to</p>
<p>ourselves what we have seen.</p>
<p>First of all I showed you prehistoric man--a creature very</p>
<p>simple in his habits and very unattractive in his manners. I</p>
<p>told you how he was the most defenceless of the many animals</p>
<p>that roamed through the early wilderness of the five continents,</p>
<p>but being possessed of a larger and better brain, he managed to</p>
<p>hold his own.</p>
<p>Then came the glaciers and the many centuries of cold</p>
<p>weather, and life on this planet became so difficult that man was</p>
<p>obliged to think three times as hard as ever before if he wished</p>
<p>to survive. Since, however, that ``wish to survive&#x27;&#x27; was (and is)</p>
<p>the mainspring which keeps every living being going full tilt to</p>
<p>the last gasp of its breath, the brain of glacial man was set to</p>
<p>work in all earnestness. Not only did these hardy people manage</p>
<p>to exist through the long cold spells which killed many</p>
<p>ferocious animals, but when the earth became warm and comfortable</p>
<p>once more, prehistoric man had learned a number of</p>
<p>things which gave him such great advantages over his less intelligent</p>
<p>neighbors that the danger of extinction (a very serious</p>
<p>one during the first half million years of man&#x27;s residence upon</p>
<p>this planet) became a very remote one.</p>
<p>I told you how these earliest ancestors of ours were slowly</p>
<p>plodding along when suddenly (and for reasons that are not</p>
<p>well understood) the people who lived in the valley of the Nile</p>
<p>rushed ahead and almost over night, created the first centre of</p>
<p>civilisation.</p>
<p>Then I showed you Mesopotamia, ``the land between the</p>
<p>rivers,&#x27;&#x27; which was the second great school of the human race.</p>
<p>And I made you a map of the little island bridges of the AEgean</p>
<p>Sea, which carried the knowledge and the science of the old</p>
<p>east to the young west, where lived the Greeks.</p>
<p>Next I told you of an Indo-European tribe, called the Hellenes,</p>
<p>who thousands of years before had left the heart of</p>
<p>Asia and who had in the eleventh century before our era pushed</p>
<p>their way into the rocky peninsula of Greece and who, since</p>
<p>then, have been known to us as the Greeks. And I told</p>
<p>you the story of the little Greek cities that were really states,</p>
<p>where the civilisation of old Egypt and Asia was transfigured</p>
<p>(that is a big word, but you can ``figure out&#x27;&#x27; what it means)</p>
<p>into something quite new, something that was much nobler and</p>
<p>finer than anything that had gone before.</p>
<p>When you look at the map you will see how by this time</p>
<p>civilisation has described a semi-circle. It begins in Egypt,</p>
<p>and by way of Mesopotamia and the AEgean Islands it moves</p>
<p>westward until it reaches the European continent. The first</p>
<p>four thousand years, Egyptians and Babylonians and Phoenicians</p>
<p>and a large number of Semitic tribes (please remember</p>
<p>that the Jews were but one of a large number of Semitic peoples)</p>
<p>have carried the torch that was to illuminate the world.</p>
<p>They now hand it over to the Indo-European Greeks, who become</p>
<p>the teachers of another Indo-European tribe, called the</p>
<p>Romans. But meanwhile the Semites have pushed westward</p>
<p>along the northern coast of Africa and have made themselves</p>
<p>the rulers of the western half of the Mediterranean just when</p>
<p>the eastern half has become a Greek (or Indo-European) possession.</p>
<p>This, as you shall see in a moment, leads to a terrible conflict</p>
<p>between the two rival races, and out of their struggle arises</p>
<p>the victorious Roman Empire, which is to take this Egyptian-</p>
<p>Mesopotamian-Greek civilisation to the furthermost corners of</p>
<p>the European continent, where it serves as the foundation upon</p>
<p>which our modern society is based.</p>
<p>I know all this sounds very complicated, but if you get hold</p>
<p>of these few principles, the rest of our history will become a</p>
<p>great deal simpler. The maps will make clear what the words</p>
<p>fail to tell. And after this short intermission, we go back to</p>
<p>our story and give you an account of the famous war between</p>
<p>Carthage and Rome.</p>
<p>ROME AND CARTHAGE</p>
<p>THE SEMITIC COLONY OF CARTHAGE ON THE</p>
<p>NORTHERN COAST OF AFRICA AND THE</p>
<p>INDO-EUROPEAN CITY OF ROME ON THE</p>
<p>WEST COAST OF ITALY FOUGHT EACH</p>
<p>OTHER FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE</p>
<p>WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN AND CARTHAGE</p>
<p>WAS DESTROYED</p>
<p>THE little Phoenician trading post of Kart-hadshat stood</p>
<p>on a low hill which overlooked the African Sea, a stretch of</p>
<p>water ninety miles wide which separates Africa from Europe.</p>
<p>It was an ideal spot for a commercial centre. Almost too ideal.</p>
<p>It grew too fast and became too rich. When in the sixth century</p>
<p>before our era, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroyed</p>
<p>Tyre, Carthage broke off all further relations with the Mother</p>
<p>Country and became an independent state--the great western</p>
<p>advance-post of the Semitic races.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the city had inherited many of the traits</p>
<p>which for a thousand years had been characteristic of the</p>
<p>Phoenicians. It was a vast business-house, protected by a</p>
<p>strong navy, indifferent to most of the finer aspects of life.</p>
<p>The city and the surrounding country and the distant colonies</p>
<p>were all ruled by a small but exceedingly powerful group of</p>
<p>rich men, The Greek word for rich is ``ploutos&#x27;&#x27; and the Greeks</p>
<p>called such a government by <code>rich men&#x27;&#x27; a </code>Plutocracy.&#x27;&#x27; Carthage</p>
<p>was a plutocracy and the real power of the state lay in</p>
<p>the hands of a dozen big ship-owners and mine-owners and</p>
<p>merchants who met in the back room of an office and regarded</p>
<p>their common Fatherland as a business enterprise which ought</p>
<p>to yield them a decent profit. They were however wide awake</p>
<p>and full of energy and worked very hard.</p>
<p>As the years went by the influence of Carthage upon her</p>
<p>neighbours increased until the greater part of the African</p>
<p>coast, Spain and certain regions of France were Carthaginian</p>
<p>possessions, and paid tribute, taxes and dividends to the mighty</p>
<p>city on the African Sea.</p>
<p>Of course, such a ``plutocracy&#x27;&#x27; was forever at the mercy of</p>
<p>the crowd. As long as there was plenty of work and wages</p>
<p>were high, the majority of the citizens were quite contented,</p>
<p>allowed their ``betters&#x27;&#x27; to rule them and asked no embarrassing</p>
<p>questions. But when no ships left the harbor, when no ore</p>
<p>was brought to the smelting-ovens, when dockworkers and</p>
<p>stevedores were thrown out of employment, then there were</p>
<p>grumblings and there was a demand that the popular assembly</p>
<p>be called together as in the olden days when Carthage had</p>
<p>been a self-governing republic.</p>
<p>To prevent such an occurrence the plutocracy was obliged</p>
<p>to keep the business of the town going at full speed. They</p>
<p>had managed to do this very successfully for almost five hun-</p>
<p>dred years when they were greatly disturbed by certain rumors</p>
<p>which reached them from the western coast of Italy. It was</p>
<p>said that a little village on the banks of the Tiber had suddenly</p>
<p>risen to great power and was making itself the acknowledged</p>
<p>leader of all the Latin tribes who inhabited central Italy.</p>
<p>It was also said that this village, which by the way was called</p>
<p>Rome, intended to build ships and go after the commerce of</p>
<p>Sicily and the southern coast of France.</p>
<p>Carthage could not possibly tolerate such competition. The</p>
<p>young rival must be destroyed lest the Carthaginian rulers</p>
<p>lose their prestige as the absolute rulers of the western</p>
<p>Mediterranean. The rumors were duly investigated and in a</p>
<p>general way these were the facts that came to light.</p>
<p>The west coast of Italy had long been neglected by civilisation.</p>
<p>Whereas in Greece all the good harbours faced eastward</p>
<p>and enjoyed a full view of the busy islands of the AEgean,</p>
<p>the west coast of Italy contemplated nothing more exciting</p>
<p>than the desolate waves of the Mediterranean. The country</p>
<p>was poor. It was therefore rarely visited by foreign merchants</p>
<p>and the natives were allowed to live in undisturbed possession</p>
<p>of their hills and their marshy plains.</p>
<p>The first serious invasion of this land came from the north.</p>
<p>At an unknown date certain Indo-European tribes had managed</p>
<p>to find their way through the passes of the Alps and had</p>
<p>pushed southward until they had filled the heel and the toe of</p>
<p>the famous Italian boot with their villages and their flocks.</p>
<p>Of these early conquerors we know nothing. No Homer sang</p>
<p>their glory. Their own accounts of the foundation of Rome</p>
<p>(written eight hundred years later when the little city had become</p>
<p>the centre of an Empire) are fairy stories and do not belong</p>
<p>in a history. Romulus and Remus jumping across each</p>
<p>other&#x27;s walls (I always forget who jumped across whose wall)</p>
<p>make entertaining reading, but the foundation of the City of</p>
<p>Rome was a much more prosaic affair. Rome began as a thousand</p>
<p>American cities have done, by being a convenient place</p>
<p>for barter and horse-trading. It lay in the heart of the plains</p>
<p>of central Italy The Tiber provided direct access to the sea.</p>
<p>The land-road from north to south found here a convenient</p>
<p>ford which could be used all the year around. And seven little</p>
<p>hills along the banks of the river offered the inhabitants a safe</p>
<p>shelter against their enemies who lived in the mountains and</p>
<p>those who lived beyond the horizon of the nearby sea.</p>
<p>The mountaineers were called the Sabines. They were a</p>
<p>rough crowd with an unholy desire for easy plunder. But they</p>
<p>were very backward. They used stone axes and wooden</p>
<p>shields and were no match for the Romans with their steel</p>
<p>swords. The sea-people on the other hand were dangerous</p>
<p>foes. They were called the Etruscans and they were (and</p>
<p>still are) one of the great mysteries of history. Nobody knew</p>
<p>(or knows) whence they came; who they were; what had driven</p>
<p>them away from their original homes. We have found the remains</p>
<p>of their cities and their cemeteries and their waterworks</p>
<p>all along the Italian coast. We are familiar with their inscriptions.</p>
<p>But as no one has ever been able to decipher the Etruscan</p>
<p>alphabet, these written messages are, so far, merely annoying</p>
<p>and not at all useful.</p>
<p>Our best guess is that the Etruscans came originally from</p>
<p>Asia Minor and that a great war or a pestilence in that country</p>
<p>had forced them to go away and seek a new home elsewhere.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for their coming, the Etruscans played a</p>
<p>great role in history. They carried the pollen of the ancient</p>
<p>civilisation from the east to the west and they taught the</p>
<p>Romans who, as we know, came from the north, the first principles</p>
<p>of architecture and street-building and fighting and art</p>
<p>and cookery and medicine and astronomy.</p>
<p>But just as the Greeks had not loved their AEgean teachers,</p>
<p>in this same way did the Romans hate their Etruscan masters.</p>
<p>They got rid of them as soon as they could and the opportunity</p>
<p>offered itself when Greek merchants discovered the</p>
<p>commercial possibilities of Italy and when the first Greek</p>
<p>vessels reached Rome. The Greeks came to trade, but they</p>
<p>stayed to instruct. They found the tribes who inhabited the</p>
<p>Roman country-side (and who were called the Latins) quite</p>
<p>willing to learn such things as might be of practical use. At</p>
<p>once they understood the great benefit that could be derived</p>
<p>from a written alphabet and they copied that of the Greeks.</p>
<p>They also understood the commercial advantages of a well-</p>
<p>regulated system of coins and measures and weights. Eventually</p>
<p>the Romans swallowed Greek civilisation hook, line and</p>
<p>sinker.</p>
<p>They even welcomed the Gods of the Greeks to their</p>
<p>country. Zeus was taken to Rome where he became known as</p>
<p>Jupiter and the other divinities followed him. The Roman Gods</p>
<p>however never were quite like their cheerful cousins who had</p>
<p>accompanied the Greeks on their road through life and through</p>
<p>history. The Roman Gods were State Functionaries. Each</p>
<p>one managed his own department with great prudence and a</p>
<p>deep sense of justice, but in turn he was exact in demanding the</p>
<p>obedience of his worshippers. This obedience the Romans rendered</p>
<p>with scrupulous care. But they never established the</p>
<p>cordial personal relations and that charming friendship which</p>
<p>had existed between the old Hellenes and the mighty residents</p>
<p>of the high Olympian peak.</p>
<p>The Romans did not imitate the Greek form of government,</p>
<p>but being of the same Indo-European stock as the people</p>
<p>of Hellas, the early history of Rome resembles that of</p>
<p>Athens and the other Greek cities. They did not find it difficult</p>
<p>to get rid of their kings, the descendants of the ancient</p>
<p>tribal chieftains. But once the kings had been driven from</p>
<p>the city, the Romans were forced to bridle the power of the</p>
<p>nobles, and it took many centuries before they managed to</p>
<p>establish a system which gave every free citizen of Rome a</p>
<p>chance to take a personal interest in the affairs of his town.</p>
<p>Thereafter the Romans enjoyed one great advantage over</p>
<p>the Greeks. They managed the affairs of their country without</p>
<p>making too many speeches. They were less imaginative</p>
<p>than the Greeks and they preferred an ounce of action to a</p>
<p>pound of words. They understood the tendency of the multi-</p>
<p>tude (the ``plebe,&#x27;&#x27; as the assemblage of free citizens was called)</p>
<p>only too well to waste valuable time upon mere talk. They</p>
<p>therefore placed the actual business of running the city into</p>
<p>the hands of two ``consuls&#x27;&#x27; who were assisted by a council of</p>
<p>Elders, called the Senate (because the word ``senex&#x27;&#x27; means an</p>
<p>old man). As a matter of custom and practical advantage the</p>
<p>senators were elected from the nobility. But their power had</p>
<p>been strictly defined.</p>
<p>Rome at one time had passed through the same sort of</p>
<p>struggle between the poor and the rich which had forced</p>
<p>Athens to adopt the laws of Draco and Solon. In Rome this</p>
<p>conflict had occurred in the fifth century B. C. As a result the</p>
<p>freemen had obtained a written code of laws which protected</p>
<p>them against the despotism of the aristocratic judges by the</p>
<p>institution of the ``Tribune.&#x27;&#x27; These Tribunes were city-</p>
<p>magistrates, elected by the freemen. They had the right to protect</p>
<p>any citizen against those actions of the government officials</p>
<p>which were thought to be unjust. A consul had the right to</p>
<p>condemn a man to death, but if the case had not been absolutely</p>
<p>proved the Tribune could interfere and save the poor</p>
<p>fellow&#x27;s life.</p>
<p>But when I use the word Rome, I seem to refer to a little</p>
<p>city of a few thousand inhabitants. And the real strength of</p>
<p>Rome lay in the country districts outside her walls. And it</p>
<p>was in the government of these outlying provinces that Rome</p>
<p>at an early age showed her wonderful gift as a colonising</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>In very early times Rome had been the only strongly fortified</p>
<p>city in central Italy, but it had always offered a hospitable</p>
<p>refuge to other Latin tribes who happened to be in danger of</p>
<p>attack. The Latin neighbours had recognised the advantages</p>
<p>of a close union with such a powerful friend and they had tried</p>
<p>to find a basis for some sort of defensive and offensive alliance.</p>
<p>Other nations, Egyptians, Babylonians, Phoenicians,</p>
<p>even Greeks, would have insisted upon a treaty of submission</p>
<p>on the part of the ``barbarians,&#x27;&#x27; The Romans did nothing of</p>
<p>the sort. They gave the ``outsider&#x27;&#x27; a chance to become partners</p>
<p>in a common ``res publica&#x27;&#x27;--or common-wealth.</p>
<p><code>You want to join us,&#x27;&#x27; they said. </code>Very well, go ahead</p>
<p>and join. We shall treat you as if you were full-fledged citizens</p>
<p>of Rome. In return for this privilege we expect you to</p>
<p>fight for our city, the mother of us all, whenever it shall be</p>
<p>necessary.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The ``outsider&#x27;&#x27; appreciated this generosity and he showed</p>
<p>his gratitude by his unswerving loyalty.</p>
<p>Whenever a Greek city had been attacked, the foreign</p>
<p>residents had moved out as quickly as they could. Why defend</p>
<p>something which meant nothing to them but a temporary</p>
<p>boarding house in which they were tolerated as long as they</p>
<p>paid their bills? But when the enemy was before the gates</p>
<p>of Rome, all the Latins rushed to her defence. It was their</p>
<p>Mother who was in danger. It was their true ``home&#x27;&#x27; even if</p>
<p>they lived a hundred miles away and had never seen the walls</p>
<p>of the sacred Hills.</p>
<p>No defeat and no disaster could change this sentiment. In</p>
<p>the beginning of the fourth century B.C. the wild Gauls forced</p>
<p>their way into Italy. They had defeated the Roman army near</p>
<p>the River Allia and had marched upon the city. They had</p>
<p>taken Rome and then they expected that the people would</p>
<p>come and sue for peace. They waited, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>After a short time the Gauls found themselves surrounded by</p>
<p>a hostile population which made it impossible for them to obtain</p>
<p>supplies. After seven months, hunger forced them to withdraw.</p>
<p>The policy of Rome to treat the ``foreigner&#x27;&#x27; on equal</p>
<p>terms had proved a great success and Rome stood stronger than</p>
<p>ever before.</p>
<p>This short account of the early history of Rome shows you</p>
<p>the enormous difference between the Roman ideal of a healthy</p>
<p>state, and that of the ancient world which was embodied in the</p>
<p>town of Carthage. The Romans counted upon the cheerful</p>
<p>and hearty co-operation between a number of ``equal citizens.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The Carthaginians, following the example of Egypt</p>
<p>and western Asia, insisted upon the unreasoning (and therefore</p>
<p>unwilling) obedience of ``Subjects&#x27;&#x27; and when these failed</p>
<p>they hired professional soldiers to do their fighting for them.</p>
<p>You will now understand why Carthage was bound to fear</p>
<p>such a clever and powerful enemy and why the plutocracy of</p>
<p>Carthage was only too willing to pick a quarrel that they might</p>
<p>destroy the dangerous rival before it was too late.</p>
<p>But the Carthaginians, being good business men, knew that</p>
<p>it never pays to rush matters. They proposed to the Romans</p>
<p>that their respective cities draw two circles on the map and</p>
<p>that each town claim one of these circles as her own ``sphere</p>
<p>of influence&#x27;&#x27; and promise to keep out of the other fellow&#x27;s</p>
<p>circle. The agreement was promptly made and was broken just</p>
<p>as promptly when both sides thought it wise to send their</p>
<p>armies to Sicily where a rich soil and a bad government invited</p>
<p>foreign interference.</p>
<p>The war which followed (the so-called first Punic War)</p>
<p>lasted twenty-four years. It was fought out on the high seas</p>
<p>and in the beginning it seemed that the experienced Car-</p>
<p>thaginian navy would defeat the newly created Roman fleet.</p>
<p>Following their ancient tactics, the Carthaginian ships would</p>
<p>either ram the enemy vessels or by a bold attack from the side</p>
<p>they would break their oars and would then kill the sailors of</p>
<p>the helpless vessel with their arrows and with fire balls. But</p>
<p>Roman engineers invented a new craft which carried a boarding</p>
<p>bridge across which the Roman infantrymen stormed the</p>
<p>hostile ship. Then there was a sudden end to Carthaginian</p>
<p>victories. At the battle of Mylae their fleet was badly defeated.</p>
<p>Carthage was obliged to sue for peace, and Sicily became part</p>
<p>of the Roman domains.</p>
<p>Twenty-three years later new trouble arose. Rome (in</p>
<p>quest of copper) had taken the island of Sardinia. Carthage</p>
<p>(in quest of silver) thereupon occupied all of southern Spain.</p>
<p>This made Carthage a direct neighbour of the Romans. The</p>
<p>latter did not like this at all and they ordered their troops to</p>
<p>cross the Pyrenees and watch the Carthaginian army of occupation.</p>
<p>The stage was set for the second outbreak between the two</p>
<p>rivals. Once more a Greek colony was the pretext for a war.</p>
<p>The Carthaginians were besieging Saguntum on the east coast</p>
<p>of Spain. The Saguntians appealed to Rome and Rome, as</p>
<p>usual, was willing to help. The Senate promised the help of</p>
<p>the Latin armies, but the preparation for this expedition took</p>
<p>some time, and meanwhile Saguntum had been taken and had</p>
<p>been destroyed. This had been done in direct opposition to</p>
<p>the will of Rome. The Senate decided upon war. One Roman</p>
<p>army was to cross the African sea and make a landing on Carthaginian</p>
<p>soil. A second division was to keep the Carthaginian</p>
<p>armies occupied in Spain to prevent them from rushing to the</p>
<p>aid of the home town. It was an excellent plan and everybody</p>
<p>expected a great victory. But the Gods had decided</p>
<p>otherwise.</p>
<p>It was the fall of the year 218 before the birth of Christ</p>
<p>and the Roman army which was to attack the Carthaginians in</p>
<p>Spain had left Italy. People were eagerly waiting for news of</p>
<p>an easy and complete victory when a terrible rumour began to</p>
<p>spread through the plain of the Po. Wild mountaineers, their</p>
<p>lips trembling with fear, told of hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p>brown men accompanied by strange beasts ``each one as big as</p>
<p>a house,&#x27;&#x27; who had suddenly emerged from the clouds of snow</p>
<p>which surrounded the old Graian pass through which Hercules,</p>
<p>thousands of years before, had driven the oxen of Geryon on</p>
<p>his way from Spain to Greece. Soon an endless stream of</p>
<p>bedraggled refugees appeared before the gates of Rome, with</p>
<p>more complete details. Hannibal, the son of Hamilcar, with</p>
<p>fifty thousand soldiers, nine thousand horsemen and thirty-</p>
<p>seven fighting elephants, had crossed the Pyrenees. He had</p>
<p>defeated the Roman army of Scipio on the banks of the Rhone</p>
<p>and he had guided his army safely across the mountain passes</p>
<p>of the Alps although it was October and the roads were thickly</p>
<p>covered with snow and ice. Then he had joined forces with</p>
<p>the Gauls and together they had defeated a second Roman</p>
<p>army just before they crossed the Trebia and laid siege to</p>
<p>Placentia, the northern terminus of the road which connected</p>
<p>Rome with the province of the Alpine districts.</p>
<p>The Senate, surprised but calm and energetic as usual,</p>
<p>hushed up the news of these many defeats and sent two fresh</p>
<p>armies to stop the invader. Hannibal managed to surprise</p>
<p>these troops on a narrow road along the shores of the Trasimene</p>
<p>Lake and there he killed all the Roman officers and most</p>
<p>of their men. This time there was a panic among the people</p>
<p>of Rome, but the Senate kept its nerve. A third army was</p>
<p>organised and the command was given to Quintus Fabius Maximus</p>
<p>with full power to act ``as was necessary to save the state.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Fabius knew that he must be very careful lest all be lost.</p>
<p>His raw and untrained men, the last available soldiers, were</p>
<p>no match for Hannibal&#x27;s veterans. He refused to accept battle</p>
<p>but forever he followed Hannibal, destroyed everything eatable,</p>
<p>destroyed the roads, attacked small detachments and generally</p>
<p>weakened the morale of the Carthaginian troops by a</p>
<p>most distressing and annoying form of guerilla warfare.</p>
<p>Such methods however did not satisfy the fearsome crowds</p>
<p>who had found safety behind the walls of Rome. They wanted</p>
<p>``action.&#x27;&#x27; Something must be done and must be done quickly.</p>
<p>A popular hero by the name of Varro, the sort of man who</p>
<p>went about the city telling everybody how much better he could</p>
<p>do things than slow old Fabius, the ``Delayer,&#x27;&#x27; was made</p>
<p>commander-in-chief by popular acclamation. At the battle of</p>
<p>Cannae (216) he suffered the most terrible defeat of Roman</p>
<p>history. More than seventy thousand men were killed. Hannibal</p>
<p>was master of all Italy.</p>
<p>He marched from one end of the peninsula to the other,</p>
<p>proclaiming himself the ``deliverer from the yoke of Rome&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>and asking the different provinces to join him in warfare upon</p>
<p>the mother city. Then once more the wisdom of Rome bore</p>
<p>noble fruit. With the exceptions of Capua and Syracuse, all</p>
<p>Roman cities remained loyal. Hannibal, the deliverer,</p>
<p>found himself opposed by the people whose friend he pretended</p>
<p>to be. He was far away from home and did not like</p>
<p>the situation. He sent messengers to Carthage to ask for fresh</p>
<p>supplies and new men. Alas, Carthage could not send him</p>
<p>either.</p>
<p>The Romans with their boarding-bridges, were the masters</p>
<p>of the sea. Hannibal must help himself as best he could.</p>
<p>He continued to defeat the Roman armies that were sent out</p>
<p>against him, but his own numbers were decreasing rapidly and</p>
<p>the Italian peasants held aloof from this self-appointed</p>
<p>``deliverer.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>After many years of uninterrupted victories, Hannibal</p>
<p>found himself besieged in the country which he had just</p>
<p>conquered. For a moment, the luck seemed to turn. Hasdrubal,</p>
<p>his brother, had defeated the Roman armies in Spain. He had</p>
<p>crossed the Alps to come to Hannibal&#x27;s assistance. He sent</p>
<p>messengers to the south to tell of his arrival and ask the other</p>
<p>army to meet him in the plain of the Tiber. Unfortunately the</p>
<p>messengers fell into the hands of the Romans and Hannibal</p>
<p>waited in vain for further news until his brother&#x27;s head, neatly</p>
<p>packed in a basket, came rolling into his camp and told him</p>
<p>of the fate of the last of the Carthaginian troops.</p>
<p>With Hasdrubal out of the way, young Publius Scipio</p>
<p>easily reconquered Spain and four years later the Romans</p>
<p>were ready for a final attack upon Carthage. Hannibal was</p>
<p>called back. He crossed the African Sea and tried to organise</p>
<p>the defences of his home-city. In the year 202 at the battle</p>
<p>of Zama, the Carthaginians were defeated. Hannibal fled to</p>
<p>Tyre. From there he went to Asia Minor to stir up the Syrians</p>
<p>and the Macedonians against Rome. He accomplished very</p>
<p>little but his activities among these Asiatic powers gave the</p>
<p>Romans an excuse to carry their warfare into the territory of</p>
<p>the east and annex the greater part of the AEgean world.</p>
<p>Driven from one city to another, a fugitive without a home,</p>
<p>Hannibal at last knew that the end of his ambitious dream had</p>
<p>come. His beloved city of Carthage had been ruined by the</p>
<p>war. She had been forced to sign a terrible peace. Her navy</p>
<p>had been sunk. She had been forbidden to make war without</p>
<p>Roman permission. She had been condemned to pay the Romans</p>
<p>millions of dollars for endless years to come. Life offered</p>
<p>no hope of a better future. In the year 190 B.C. Hannibal took</p>
<p>poison and killed himself.</p>
<p>Forty years later, the Romans forced their last war upon</p>
<p>Carthage. Three long years the inhabitants of the old Phoenician</p>
<p>colony held out against the power of the new republic.</p>
<p>Hunger forced them to surrender. The few men and women</p>
<p>who had survived the siege were sold as slaves. The city was</p>
<p>set on fire. For two whole weeks the store-houses and the pal-</p>
<p>aces and the great arsenal burned. Then a terrible curse was</p>
<p>pronounced upon the blackened ruins and the Roman legions</p>
<p>returned to Italy to enjoy their victory.</p>
<p>For the next thousand years, the Mediterranean remained</p>
<p>a European sea. But as soon as the Roman Empire had been</p>
<p>destroyed, Asia made another attempt to dominate this great</p>
<p>inland sea, as you will learn when I tell you about Mohammed.</p>
<p>THE RISE OF ROME</p>
<p>HOW ROME HAPPENED</p>
<p>THE Roman Empire was an accident. No one planned it.</p>
<p>It ``happened.&#x27;&#x27; No famous general or statesman or cut-</p>
<p>throat ever got up and said ``Friends, Romans, Citizens, we</p>
<p>must found an Empire. Follow me and together we shall conquer</p>
<p>all the land from the Gates of Hercules to Mount Taurus.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Rome produced famous generals and equally distinguished</p>
<p>statesmen and cut-throats, and Roman armies fought all over</p>
<p>the world. But the Roman empire-making was done without</p>
<p>a preconceived plan. The average Roman was a very matter-</p>
<p>of-fact citizen. He disliked theories about government. When</p>
<p>someone began to recite ``eastward the course of Roman Empire,</p>
<p>etc., etc.,&#x27;&#x27; he hastily left the forum. He just continued</p>
<p>to take more and more land because circumstances forced him</p>
<p>to do so. He was not driven by ambition or by greed. Both</p>
<p>by nature and inclination he was a farmer and wanted to stay</p>
<p>at home. But when he was attacked he was obliged to defend</p>
<p>himself and when the enemy happened to cross the sea to ask</p>
<p>for aid in a distant country then the patient Roman marched</p>
<p>many dreary miles to defeat this dangerous foe and when this</p>
<p>had been accomplished, he stayed behind to adminster{sic} his</p>
<p>newly conquered provinces lest they fall into the hands of</p>
<p>wandering Barbarians and become themselves a menace to</p>
<p>Roman safety. It sounds rather complicated and yet to the</p>
<p>contemporaries it was so very simple, as you shall see in a moment.</p>
<p>In the year 203 B.C. Scipio had crossed the African Sea</p>
<p>and had carried the war into Africa. Carthage had called Hannibal</p>
<p>back. Badly supported by his mercenaries, Hannibal</p>
<p>had been defeated near Zama. The Romans had asked for his</p>
<p>surrender and Hannibal had fled to get aid from the kings of</p>
<p>Macedonia and Syria, as I told you in my last chapter.</p>
<p>The rulers of these two countries (remnants of the Empire</p>
<p>of Alexander the Great) just then were contemplating an</p>
<p>expedition against Egypt. They hoped to divide the rich Nile</p>
<p>valley between themselves. The king of Egypt had heard of</p>
<p>this and he had asked Rome to come to his support. The stage</p>
<p>was set for a number of highly interesting plots and counter-</p>
<p>plots. But the Romans, with their lack of imagination, rang</p>
<p>the curtain down before the play had been fairly started.</p>
<p>Their legions completely defeated the heavy Greek phalanx</p>
<p>which was still used by the Macedonians as their battle formation.</p>
<p>That happened in the year 197 B.C. at the battle in the</p>
<p>plains of Cynoscephalae, or ``Dogs&#x27; Heads,&#x27;&#x27; in central Thessaly.</p>
<p>The Romans then marched southward to Attica and informed</p>
<p>the Greeks that they had come to ``deliver the Hellenes</p>
<p>from the Macedonian yoke.&#x27;&#x27; The Greeks, having learned</p>
<p>nothing in their years of semi-slavery, used their new freedom</p>
<p>in a most unfortunate way. All the little city-states once more</p>
<p>began to quarrel with each other as they had done in the good</p>
<p>old days. The Romans, who had little understanding and less</p>
<p>love for these silly bickerings of a race which they rather despised,</p>
<p>showed great forebearance. But tiring of these endless</p>
<p>dissensions they lost patience, invaded Greece, burned down</p>
<p>Corinth (to ``encourage the other Greeks&#x27;&#x27;) and sent a Roman</p>
<p>governor to Athens to rule this turbulent province. In this</p>
<p>way, Macedonia and Greece became buffer states which protected</p>
<p>Rome&#x27;s eastern frontier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile right across the Hellespont lay the Kingdom of</p>
<p>Syria, and Antiochus III, who ruled that vast land, had shown</p>
<p>great eagerness when his distinguished guest, General Han-</p>
<p>nibal, explained to him how easy it would be to invade Italy</p>
<p>and sack the city of Rome.</p>
<p>Lucius Scipio, a brother of Scipio the African fighter who</p>
<p>had defeated Hannibal and his Carthaginians at Zama, was</p>
<p>sent to Asia Minor. He destroyed the armies of the Syrian</p>
<p>king near Magnesia (in the year 190 B.C.) Shortly afterwards,</p>
<p>Antiochus was lynched by his own people. Asia Minor</p>
<p>became a Roman protectorate and the small City-Republic of</p>
<p>Rome was mistress of most of the lands which bordered upon</p>
<p>the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>THE ROMAN EMPIRE</p>
<p>HOW THE REPUBLIC OF ROME AFTER CENTURIES</p>
<p>OF UNREST AND REVOLUTION BECAME</p>
<p>AN EMPIRE</p>
<p>WHEN the Roman armies returned from these many victorious</p>
<p>campaigns, they were received with great jubilation.</p>
<p>Alas and alack! this sudden glory did not make the country any</p>
<p>happier. On the contrary. The endless campaigns had ruined</p>
<p>the farmers who had been obliged to do the hard work of Empire</p>
<p>making. It had placed too much power in the hands of the</p>
<p>successful generals (and their private friends) who had used</p>
<p>the war as an excuse for wholesale robbery.</p>
<p>The old Roman Republic had been proud of the simplicity</p>
<p>which had characterised the lives of her famous men. The</p>
<p>new Republic felt ashamed of the shabby coats and the high</p>
<p>principles which had been fashionable in the days of its grandfathers.</p>
<p>It became a land of rich people ruled by rich people</p>
<p>for the benefit of rich people. As such it was doomed to</p>
<p>disastrous failure, as I shall now tell you.</p>
<p>Within less than a century and a half. Rome had become</p>
<p>the mistress of practically all the land around the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In those early days of history a prisoner of war lost</p>
<p>his freedom and became a slave. The Roman regarded war as</p>
<p>a very serious business and he showed no mercy to a conquered</p>
<p>foe. After the fall of Carthage, the Carthaginian women and</p>
<p>children were sold into bondage together with their own slaves.</p>
<p>And a like fate awaited the obstinate inhabitants of Greece and</p>
<p>Macedonia and Spain and Syria when they dared to revolt</p>
<p>against the Roman power.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago a slave was merely a piece of</p>
<p>machinery. Nowadays a rich man invests his money in factories.</p>
<p>The rich people of Rome (senators, generals and war-</p>
<p>profiteers) invested theirs in land and in slaves. The land</p>
<p>they bought or took in the newly-acquired provinces. The</p>
<p>slaves they bought in open market wherever they happened to</p>
<p>be cheapest. During most of the third and second centuries</p>
<p>before Christ there was a plentiful supply, and as a result the</p>
<p>landowners worked their slaves until they dropped dead in their</p>
<p>tracks, when they bought new ones at the nearest bargain-counter</p>
<p>of Corinthian or Carthaginian captives.</p>
<p>And now behold the fate of the freeborn farmer!</p>
<p>He had done his duty toward Rome and he had fought her</p>
<p>battles without complaint. But when he came home after ten,</p>
<p>fifteen or twenty years, his lands were covered with weeds and</p>
<p>his family had been ruined. But he was a strong man and</p>
<p>willing to begin life anew. He sowed and planted and waited</p>
<p>for the harvest. He carried his grain to the market together</p>
<p>with his cattle and his poultry, to find that the large landowners</p>
<p>who worked their estates with slaves could underbid him all</p>
<p>along the line. For a couple of years he tried to hold his own.</p>
<p>Then he gave up in despair. He left the country and he went</p>
<p>to the nearest city. In the city he was as hungry as he had been</p>
<p>before on the land. But he shared his misery with thousands</p>
<p>of other disinherited beings. They crouched together in filthy</p>
<p>hovels in the suburbs of the large cities. They were apt</p>
<p>to get sick and die from terrible epidemics. They were all</p>
<p>profoundly discontented. They had fought for their country and</p>
<p>this was their reward. They were always willing to listen to</p>
<p>those plausible spell-binders who gather around a public</p>
<p>grievance like so many hungry vultures, and soon they became a</p>
<p>grave menace to the safety of the state.</p>
<p>But the class of the newly-rich shrugged its shoulders.</p>
<p><code>We have our army and our policemen,&#x27;&#x27; they argued, </code>they</p>
<p>will keep the mob in order.&#x27;&#x27; And they hid themselves behind</p>
<p>the high walls of their pleasant villas and cultivated their</p>
<p>gardens and read the poems of a certain Homer which a Greek</p>
<p>slave had just translated into very pleasing Latin hexameters.</p>
<p>In a few families however the old tradition of unselfish</p>
<p>service to the Commonwealth continued. Cornelia, the daughter</p>
<p>of Scipio Africanus, had been married to a Roman by the</p>
<p>name of Gracchus. She had two sons, Tiberius and Gaius.</p>
<p>When the boys grew up they entered politics and tried to bring</p>
<p>about certain much-needed reforms. A census had shown</p>
<p>that most of the land of the Italian peninsula was owned by</p>
<p>two thousand noble families. Tiberius Gracchus, having been</p>
<p>elected a Tribune, tried to help the freemen. He revived two</p>
<p>ancient laws which restricted the number of acres which a single</p>
<p>owner might possess. In this way he hoped to revive the</p>
<p>valuable old class of small and independent freeholders. The</p>
<p>newly-rich called him a robber and an enemy of the state.</p>
<p>There were street riots. A party of thugs was hired to kill the</p>
<p>popular Tribune. Tiberius Gracchus was attacked when he</p>
<p>entered the assembly and was beaten to death. Ten years later</p>
<p>his brother Gaius tried the experiment of reforming a nation</p>
<p>against the expressed wishes of a strong privileged class. He</p>
<p>passed a ``poor law&#x27;&#x27; which was meant to help the destitute</p>
<p>farmers. Eventually it made the greater part of the Roman</p>
<p>citizens into professional beggars.</p>
<p>He established colonies of destitute people in distant parts</p>
<p>of the empire, but these settlements failed to attract the right</p>
<p>sort of people. Before Gaius Gracchus could do more harm he</p>
<p>too was murdered and his followers were either killed or exiled.</p>
<p>The first two reformers had been gentlemen. The two who</p>
<p>came after were of a very different stamp. They were</p>
<p>professional soldiers. One was called Marius. The name of the</p>
<p>other was Sulla. Both enjoyed a large personal following.</p>
<p>Sulla was the leader of the landowners. Marius, the victor</p>
<p>in a great battle at the foot of the Alps when the Teutons</p>
<p>and the Cimbri had been annihilated, was the popular hero</p>
<p>of the disinherited freemen.</p>
<p>Now it happened in the year 88 B.C. that the Senate of</p>
<p>Rome was greatly disturbed by rumours that came from Asia.</p>
<p>Mithridates, king of a country along the shores of the Black</p>
<p>Sea, and a Greek on his mother&#x27;s side, had seen the possibility</p>
<p>of establishing a second Alexandrian Empire. He began his</p>
<p>campaign for world-domination with the murder of all Roman</p>
<p>citizens who happened to be in Asia Minor, men, women and</p>
<p>children. Such an act, of course, meant war. The Senate</p>
<p>equipped an army to march against the King of Pontus and</p>
<p>punish him for his crime. But who was to be commander-in-</p>
<p>chief? <code>Sulla,&#x27;&#x27; said the Senate, </code>because he is Consul.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p><code>Marius,&#x27;&#x27; said the mob, </code>because he has been Consul five times</p>
<p>and because he is the champion of our rights.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Possession is nine points of the law. Sulla happened to be</p>
<p>in actual command of the army. He went west to defeat</p>
<p>Mithridates and Marius fled to Africa. There he waited</p>
<p>until he heard that Sulla had crossed into Asia. He then</p>
<p>returned to Italy, gathered a motley crew of malcontents,</p>
<p>marched on Rome and entered the city with his professional</p>
<p>highwaymen, spent five days and five nights, slaughtering the</p>
<p>enemies of the Senatorial party, got himself elected Consul and</p>
<p>promptly died from the excitement of the last fortnight.</p>
<p>There followed four years of disorder. Then Sulla, having</p>
<p>defeated Mithridates, announced that he was ready to return</p>
<p>to Rome and settle a few old scores of his own. He was as</p>
<p>good as his word. For weeks his soldiers were busy executing</p>
<p>those of their fellow citizens who were suspected of democratic</p>
<p>sympathies. One day they got hold of a young fellow who</p>
<p>had been often seen in the company of Marius. They were</p>
<p>going to hang him when some one interfered. ``The boy is too</p>
<p>young,&#x27;&#x27; he said, and they let him go. His name was Julius</p>
<p>Caesar. You shall meet him again on the next page.</p>
<p>As for Sulla, he became ``Dictator,&#x27;&#x27; which meant sole and</p>
<p>supreme ruler of all the Roman possessions. He ruled Rome</p>
<p>for four years, and he died quietly in his bed, having spent the</p>
<p>last year of his life tenderly raising his cabbages, as was the</p>
<p>custom of so many Romans who had spent a lifetime killing</p>
<p>their fellow-men.</p>
<p>But conditions did not grow better. On the contrary, they</p>
<p>grew worse. Another general, Gnaeus Pompeius, or Pompey,</p>
<p>a close friend of Sulla, went east to renew the war against the</p>
<p>ever troublesome Mithridates. He drove that energetic potentate</p>
<p>into the mountains where Mithridates took poison and</p>
<p>killed himself, well knowing what fate awaited him as a Roman</p>
<p>captive. Next he re-established the authority of Rome over</p>
<p>Syria, destroyed Jerusalem, roamed through western Asia,</p>
<p>trying to revive the myth of Alexander the Great, and at last</p>
<p>(in the year 62) returned to Rome with a dozen ship-loads of</p>
<p>defeated Kings and Princes and Generals, all of whom were</p>
<p>forced to march in the triumphal procession of this enormously</p>
<p>popular Roman who presented his city with the sum of forty</p>
<p>million dollars in plunder.</p>
<p>It was necessary that the government of Rome be placed</p>
<p>in the hands of a strong man. Only a few months before, the</p>
<p>town had almost fallen into the hands of a good-for-nothing</p>
<p>young aristocrat by the name of Catiline, who had gambled</p>
<p>away his money and hoped to reimburse himself for his losses by</p>
<p>a little plundering. Cicero, a public-spirited lawyer, had discovered</p>
<p>the plot, had warned the Senate, and had forced Catiline</p>
<p>to flee. But there were other young men with similar ambitions</p>
<p>and it was no time for idle talk.</p>
<p>Pompey organised a triumvirate which was to take charge</p>
<p>of affairs. He became the leader of this Vigilante Committee.</p>
<p>Gaius Julius Caesar, who had made a reputation for himself</p>
<p>as governor of Spain, was the second in command. The</p>
<p>third was an indifferent sort of person by the name of Crassus.</p>
<p>He had been elected because he was incredibly rich, having been</p>
<p>a successful contractor of war supplies. He soon went upon</p>
<p>an expedition against the Parthians and was killed.</p>
<p>As for Caesar, who was by far the ablest of the three, he</p>
<p>decided that he needed a little more military glory to become</p>
<p>a popular hero. He crossed the Alps and conquered that part</p>
<p>of the world which is now called France. Then he hammered</p>
<p>a solid wooden bridge across the Rhine and invaded the land</p>
<p>of the wild Teutons. Finally he took ship and visited England.</p>
<p>Heaven knows where he might have ended if he had not been</p>
<p>forced to return to Italy. Pompey, so he was informed, had</p>
<p>been appointed dictator for life. This of course meant that</p>
<p>Caesar was to be placed on the list of the ``retired officers,&#x27;&#x27; and</p>
<p>the idea did not appeal to him. He remembered that he had</p>
<p>begun life as a follower of Marius. He decided to teach the</p>
<p>Senators and their ``dictator&#x27;&#x27; another lesson. He crossed the</p>
<p>Rubicon River which separated the province of Cis-alpine Gaul</p>
<p>from Italy. Everywhere he was received as the ``friend of the</p>
<p>people.&#x27;&#x27; Without difficulty Caesar entered Rome and Pompey</p>
<p>fled to Greece Caesar followed him and defeated his followers</p>
<p>near Pharsalus. Pompey sailed across the Mediterranean and</p>
<p>escaped to Egypt. When he landed he was murdered by order</p>
<p>of young king Ptolemy. A few days later Caesar arrived.</p>
<p>He found himself caught in a trap. Both the Egyptians and</p>
<p>the Roman garrison which had remained faithful to Pompey,</p>
<p>attacked his camp.</p>
<p>Fortune was with Caesar. He succeeded in setting fire to</p>
<p>the Egyptian fleet. Incidentally the sparks of the burning</p>
<p>vessels fell on the roof of the famous library of Alexandria</p>
<p>(which was just off the water front,) and destroyed it. Next</p>
<p>he attacked the Egyptian army, drove the soldiers into the</p>
<p>Nile, drowned Ptolemy, and established a new government</p>
<p>under Cleopatra, the sister of the late king. Just then word</p>
<p>reached him that Pharnaces, the son and heir of Mithridates,</p>
<p>had gone on the war-path. Caesar marched northward, defeated</p>
<p>Pharnaces in a war which lasted five days, sent word of</p>
<p>his victory to Rome in the famous sentence ``veni, vidi, vici,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>which is Latin for ``I came, I saw, I conquered,&#x27;&#x27; and returned</p>
<p>to Egypt where he fell desperately in love with Cleopatra, who</p>
<p>followed him to Rome when he returned to take charge of the</p>
<p>government, in the year 46. He marched at the head of not</p>
<p>less than four different victory-parades, having won four</p>
<p>different campaigns.</p>
<p>Then Caesar appeared in the Senate to report upon his</p>
<p>adventures, and the grateful Senate made him ``dictator&#x27;&#x27; for</p>
<p>ten years. It was a fatal step.</p>
<p>The new dictator made serious attempts to reform the</p>
<p>Roman state. He made it possible for freemen to become</p>
<p>members of the Senate. He conferred the rights of citizenship</p>
<p>upon distant communities as had been done in the early days</p>
<p>of Roman history. He permitted ``foreigners&#x27;&#x27; to exercise</p>
<p>influence upon the government. He reformed the administration</p>
<p>of the distant provinces which certain aristocratic families</p>
<p>had come to regard as their private possessions. In short he</p>
<p>did many things for the good of the majority of the people but</p>
<p>which made him thoroughly unpopular with the most powerful</p>
<p>men in the state. Half a hundred young aristocrats formed a</p>
<p>plot ``to save the Republic.&#x27;&#x27; On the Ides of March (the fifteenth</p>
<p>of March according to that new calendar which Caesar</p>
<p>had brought with him from Egypt) Caesar was murdered when</p>
<p>he entered the Senate. Once more Rome was without a master.</p>
<p>There were two men who tried to continue the tradition of</p>
<p>Caesar&#x27;s glory. One was Antony, his former secretary. The</p>
<p>other was Octavian, Caesar&#x27;s grand-nephew and heir to his</p>
<p>estate. Octavian remained in Rome, but Antony went to Egypt</p>
<p>to be near Cleopatra with whom he too had fallen in love, as</p>
<p>seems to have been the habit of Roman generals.</p>
<p>A war broke out between the two. In the battle of Actium,</p>
<p>Octavian defeated Antony. Antony killed himself and</p>
<p>Cleopatra was left alone to face the enemy. She tried very</p>
<p>hard to make Octavian her third Roman conquest. When she</p>
<p>saw that she could make no impression upon this very proud</p>
<p>aristocrat, she killed herself, and Egypt became a Roman province.</p>
<p>As for Octavian, he was a very wise young man and he did</p>
<p>not repeat the mistake of his famous uncle. He knew how</p>
<p>people will shy at words. He was very modest in his demands</p>
<p>when he returned to Rome. He did not want to be a ``dictator.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>He would be entirely satisfied with the title of ``the Honourable.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>But when the Senate, a few years later, addressed</p>
<p>him as Augustus--the Illustrious--he did not object and a few</p>
<p>years later the man in the street called him Caesar, or Kaiser,</p>
<p>while the soldiers, accustomed to regard Octavian as their</p>
<p>Commander-in-chief referred to him as the Chief, the Imperator or</p>
<p>Emperor. The Republic had become an Empire, but the average</p>
<p>Roman was hardly aware of the fact.</p>
<p>In 14 A.D. his position as the Absolute Ruler of the</p>
<p>Roman people had become so well established that he was made</p>
<p>an object of that divine worship which hitherto had been reserved</p>
<p>for the Gods. And his successors were true ``Emperors&#x27;&#x27;--the</p>
<p>absolute rulers of the greatest empire the world had</p>
<p>ever seen.</p>
<p>If the truth be told, the average citizen was sick and tired</p>
<p>of anarchy and disorder. He did not care who ruled him provided</p>
<p>the new master gave him a chance to live quietly and</p>
<p>without the noise of eternal street riots. Octavian assured his</p>
<p>subjects forty years of peace. He had no desire to extend the</p>
<p>frontiers of his domains, In the year 9 A.D. he had contem-</p>
<p>plated an invasion of the northwestern wilderness which was</p>
<p>inhabited by the Teutons. But Varrus, his general, had been</p>
<p>killed with all his men in the Teutoburg Woods, and after that</p>
<p>the Romans made no further attempts to civilise these wild</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>They concentrated their efforts upon the gigantic problem</p>
<p>of internal reform. But it was too late to do much good. Two</p>
<p>centuries of revolution and foreign war had repeatedly killed</p>
<p>the best men among the younger generations. It had ruined</p>
<p>the class of the free farmers. It had introduced slave labor,</p>
<p>against which no freeman could hope to compete. It had</p>
<p>turned the cities into beehives inhabited by pauperized and</p>
<p>unhealthy mobs of runaway peasants. It had created a large</p>
<p>bureaucracy--petty officials who were underpaid and who were</p>
<p>forced to take graft in order to buy bread and clothing for</p>
<p>their families. Worst of all, it had accustomed people to violence,</p>
<p>to blood-shed, to a barbarous pleasure in the pain and</p>
<p>suffering of others.</p>
<p>Outwardly, the Roman state during the first century of our</p>
<p>era was a magnificent political structure, so large that Alexander&#x27;s</p>
<p>empire became one of its minor provinces. Underneath</p>
<p>this glory there lived millions upon millions of poor and tired</p>
<p>human beings, toiling like ants who have built a nest underneath</p>
<p>a heavy stone. They worked for the benefit of some one</p>
<p>else. They shared their food with the animals of the fields.</p>
<p>They lived in stables. They died without hope.</p>
<p>It was the seven hundred and fifty-third year since the</p>
<p>founding of Rome. Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus Augustus</p>
<p>was living in the palace of the Palatine Hill, busily engaged</p>
<p>upon the task of ruling his empire.</p>
<p>In a little village of distant Syria, Mary, the wife of Joseph</p>
<p>the Carpenter, was tending her little boy, born in a stable of</p>
<p>Bethlehem.</p>
<p>This is a strange world.</p>
<p>Before long, the palace and the stable were to meet in open</p>
<p>combat.</p>
<p>And the stable was to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>JOSHUA OF NAZARETH</p>
<p>THE STORY OF JOSHUA OF NAZARETH, WHOM</p>
<p>THE GREEKS CALLED JESUS</p>
<p>IN the autumn of the year of the city 783 (which would be</p>
<p>62 A.D., in our way of counting time) AEsculapius Cultellus, a</p>
<p>Roman physician, wrote to his nephew who was with the army</p>
<p>in Syria as follows:</p>
<p>My dear Nephew,</p>
<p>A few days ago I was called in to prescribe for a sick man</p>
<p>named Paul. He appeared to be a Roman citizen of Jewish</p>
<p>parentage, well educated and of agreeable manners. I had</p>
<p>been told that he was here in connection with a law-suit, an appeal</p>
<p>from one of our provincial courts, Caesarea or some such</p>
<p>place in the eastern Mediterranean. He had been described to</p>
<p>me as a ``wild and violent&#x27;&#x27; fellow who had been making</p>
<p>speeches against the People and against the Law. I found him</p>
<p>very intelligent and of great honesty.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who used to be with the army in Asia</p>
<p>Minor tells me that he heard something about him in Ephesus</p>
<p>where he was preaching sermons about a strange new God. I</p>
<p>asked my patient if this were true and whether he had told the</p>
<p>people to rebel against the will of our beloved Emperor. Paul</p>
<p>answered me that the Kingdom of which he had spoken was</p>
<p>not of this world and he added many strange utterances which</p>
<p>I did not understand, but which were probably due to his</p>
<p>fever.</p>
<p>His personality made a great impression upon me and I</p>
<p>was sorry to hear that he was killed on the Ostian Road a few</p>
<p>days ago. Therefore I am writing this letter to you. When</p>
<p>next you visit Jerusalem, I want you to find out something</p>
<p>about my friend Paul and the strange Jewish prophet, who</p>
<p>seems to have been his teacher. Our slaves are getting much</p>
<p>excited about this so-called Messiah, and a few of them, who</p>
<p>openly talked of the new kingdom (whatever that means) have</p>
<p>been crucified. I would like to know the truth about all these</p>
<p>rumours and I am</p>

<p>Six weeks later, Gladius Ensa, the nephew, a captain of the</p>
<p>VII Gallic Infantry, answered as follows:</p>
<p>My dear Uncle,</p>
<p>I received your letter and I have obeyed your instructions.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago our brigade was sent to Jerusalem. There</p>
<p>have been several revolutions during the last century and there</p>
<p>is not much left of the old city. We have been here now for a</p>
<p>month and to-morrow we shall continue our march to Petra,</p>
<p>where there has been trouble with some of the Arab tribes. I</p>
<p>shall use this evening to answer your questions, but pray do</p>
<p>not expect a detailed report.</p>
<p>I have talked with most of the older men in this city but</p>
<p>few have been able to give me any definite information. A</p>
<p>few days ago a pedler came to the camp. I bought some of</p>
<p>his olives and I asked him whether he had ever heard of the</p>
<p>famous Messiah who was killed when he was young. He said</p>
<p>that he remembered it very clearly, because his father had</p>
<p>taken him to Golgotha (a hill just outside the city) to see</p>
<p>the execution, and to show him what became of the enemies of</p>
<p>the laws of the people of Judaea. He gave me the address of</p>
<p>one Joseph, who had been a personal friend of the Messiah</p>
<p>and told me that I had better go and see him if I wanted to</p>
<p>know more.</p>
<p>This morning I went to call on Joseph. He was quite an</p>
<p>old man. He had been a fisherman on one of the fresh-water</p>
<p>lakes. His memory was clear, and from him at last I got a</p>
<p>fairly definite account of what had happened during the</p>
<p>troublesome days before I was born.</p>
<p>Tiberius, our great and glorious emperor, was on the throne,</p>
<p>and an officer of the name of Pontius Pilatus was governor of</p>
<p>Judaea and Samaria. Joseph knew little about this Pilatus.</p>
<p>He seemed to have been an honest enough official who left a</p>
<p>decent reputation as procurator of the province. In the year</p>
<p>755 or 756 (Joseph had forgotten when) Pilatus was called to</p>
<p>Jerusalem on account of a riot. A certain young man (the</p>
<p>son of a carpenter of Nazareth) was said to be planning a</p>
<p>revolution against the Roman government. Strangely enough</p>
<p>our own intelligence officers, who are usually well informed,</p>
<p>appear to have heard nothing about it, and when they investigated</p>
<p>the matter they reported that the carpenter was an</p>
<p>excellent citizen and that there was no reason to proceed against</p>
<p>him. But the old-fashioned leaders of the Jewish faith, according</p>
<p>to Joseph, were much upset. They greatly disliked his</p>
<p>popularity with the masses of the poorer Hebrews. The</p>
<p>``Nazarene&#x27;&#x27; (so they told Pilatus) had publicly claimed that a</p>
<p>Greek or a Roman or even a Philistine, who tried to live a decent</p>
<p>and honourable life, was quite as good as a Jew who spent</p>
<p>his days studying the ancient laws of Moses. Pilatus does not</p>
<p>seem to have been impressed by this argument, but when the</p>
<p>crowds around the temple threatened to lynch Jesus, and kill</p>
<p>all his followers, he decided to take the carpenter into custody</p>
<p>to save his life.</p>
<p>He does not appear to have understood the real nature of</p>
<p>the quarrel. Whenever he asked the Jewish priests to explain</p>
<p>their grievances, they shouted <code>heresy&#x27;&#x27; and </code>treason&#x27;&#x27; and got</p>
<p>terribly excited. Finally, so Joseph told me, Pilatus sent for</p>
<p>Joshua (that was the name of the Nazarene, but the Greeks</p>
<p>who live in this part of the world always refer to him as Jesus)</p>
<p>to examine him personally. He talked to him for several</p>
<p>hours. He asked him about the ``dangerous doctrines&#x27;&#x27; which</p>
<p>he was said to have preached on the shores of the sea of Galilee.</p>
<p>But Jesus answered that he never referred to politics. He was</p>
<p>not so much interested in the bodies of men as in Man&#x27;s soul.</p>
<p>He wanted all people to regard their neighbours as their</p>
<p>brothers and to love one single God, who was the father of all</p>
<p>living beings.</p>
<p>Pilatus, who seems to have been well versed in the doctrines</p>
<p>of the Stoics and the other Greek philosophers, does not appear</p>
<p>to have discovered anything seditious in the talk of Jesus.</p>
<p>According to my informant he made another attempt to save</p>
<p>the life of the kindly prophet. He kept putting the execution</p>
<p>off. Meanwhile the Jewish people, lashed into fury by their</p>
<p>priests, got frantic with rage. There had been many riots in</p>
<p>Jerusalem before this and there were only a few Roman soldiers</p>
<p>within calling distance. Reports were being sent to the</p>
<p>Roman authorities in Caesarea that Pilatus had ``fallen a victim</p>
<p>to the teachings of the Nazarene.&#x27;&#x27; Petitions were being</p>
<p>circulated all through the city to have Pilatus recalled, because</p>
<p>he was an enemy of the Emperor. You know that our governors</p>
<p>have strict instructions to avoid an open break with</p>
<p>their foreign subjects. To save the country from civil war,</p>
<p>Pilatus finally sacrificed his prisoner, Joshua, who behaved</p>
<p>with great dignity and who forgave all those who hated him.</p>
<p>He was crucified amidst the howls and the laughter of the</p>
<p>Jerusalem mob.</p>
<p>That is what Joseph told me, with tears running down his</p>
<p>old cheeks. I gave him a gold piece when I left him, but he</p>
<p>refused it and asked me to hand it to one poorer than himself.</p>
<p>I also asked him a few questions about your friend Paul. He</p>
<p>had known him slightly. He seems to have been a tent maker</p>
<p>who gave up his profession that he might preach the words of</p>
<p>a loving and forgiving God, who was so very different from</p>
<p>that Jehovah of whom the Jewish priests are telling us all</p>
<p>the time. Afterwards, Paul appears to have travelled much</p>
<p>in Asia Minor and in Greece, telling the slaves that they were</p>
<p>all children of one loving Father and that happiness awaits all,</p>
<p>both rich and poor, who have tried to live honest lives and have</p>
<p>done good to those who were suffering and miserable.</p>
<p>I hope that I have answered your questions to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>The whole story seems very harmless to me as far as</p>
<p>the safety of the state is concerned. But then, we Romans</p>
<p>never have been able to understand the people of this province.</p>

<p>THE FALL OF ROME</p>
<p>THE TWILIGHT OF ROME</p>
<p>THE text-books of ancient History give the date 476 as the</p>
<p>year in which Rome fell, because in that year the last emperor</p>
<p>was driven off his throne. But Rome, which was not built in</p>
<p>a day, took a long time falling. The process was so slow and</p>
<p>so gradual that most Romans did not realise how their old</p>
<p>world was coming to an end. They complained about the unrest</p>
<p>of the times--they grumbled about the high prices of food</p>
<p>and about the low wages of the workmen--they cursed the</p>
<p>profiteers who had a monopoly of the grain and the wool and</p>
<p>the gold coin. Occasionally they rebelled against an unusually</p>
<p>rapacious governor. But the majority of the people during the</p>
<p>first four centuries of our era ate and drank (whatever their</p>
<p>purse allowed them to buy) and hated or loved (according to</p>
<p>their nature) and went to the theatre (whenever there was a</p>
<p>free show of fighting gladiators) or starved in the slums of the</p>
<p>big cities, utterly ignorant of the fact that their empire had</p>
<p>outlived its usefulness and was doomed to perish.</p>
<p>How could they realise the threatened danger? Rome</p>
<p>made a fine showing of outward glory. Well-paved roads connected</p>
<p>the different provinces, the imperial police were active</p>
<p>and showed little tenderness for highwaymen. The frontier</p>
<p>was closely guarded against the savage tribes who seemed to</p>
<p>be occupying the waste lands of northern Europe. The whole</p>
<p>world was paying tribute to the mighty city of Rome, and a</p>
<p>score of able men were working day and night to undo the</p>
<p>mistakes of the past and bring about a return to the happier</p>
<p>conditions of the early Republic.</p>
<p>But the underlying causes of the decay of the State, of</p>
<p>which I have told you in a former chapter, had not been</p>
<p>removed and reform therefore was impossible.</p>
<p>Rome was, first and last and all the time, a city-state as</p>
<p>Athens and Corinth had been city-states in ancient Hellas. It</p>
<p>had been able to dominate the Italian peninsula. But Rome</p>
<p>as the ruler of the entire civilised world was a political</p>
<p>impossibility and could not endure. Her young men were killed in</p>
<p>her endless wars. Her farmers were ruined by long military</p>
<p>service and by taxation. They either became professional</p>
<p>beggars or hired themselves out to rich landowners who gave</p>
<p>them board and lodging in exchange for their services and</p>
<p>made them ``serfs,&#x27;&#x27; those unfortunate human beings who are</p>
<p>neither slaves nor freemen, but who have become part of the</p>
<p>soil upon which they work, like so many cows, and the trees.</p>
<p>The Empire, the State, had become everything. The common</p>
<p>citizen had dwindled down to less than nothing. As for</p>
<p>the slaves, they had heard the words that were spoken by Paul.</p>
<p>They had accepted the message of the humble carpenter of</p>
<p>Nazareth. They did not rebel against their masters. On the</p>
<p>contrary, they had been taught to be meek and they obeyed</p>
<p>their superiors. But they had lost all interest in the affairs</p>
<p>of this world which had proved such a miserable place of abode.</p>
<p>They were willing to fight the good fight that they might enter</p>
<p>into the Kingdom of Heaven. But they were not willing to</p>
<p>engage in warfare for the benefit of an ambitious emperor who</p>
<p>aspired to glory by way of a foreign campaign in the land of</p>
<p>the Parthians or the Numidians or the Scots.</p>
<p>And so conditions grew worse as the centuries went by.</p>
<p>The first Emperors had continued the tradition of ``leadership&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>which had given the old tribal chieftains such a hold upon</p>
<p>their subjects. But the Emperors of the second and third</p>
<p>centuries were Barrack-Emperors, professional soldiers, who</p>
<p>existed by the grace of their body-guards, the so-called Prae-</p>
<p>torians. They succeeded each other with terrifying rapidity,</p>
<p>murdering their way into the palace and being murdered out</p>
<p>of it as soon as their successors had become rich enough to bribe</p>
<p>the guards into a new rebellion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the barbarians were hammering at the gates of</p>
<p>the northern frontier. As there were no longer any native</p>
<p>Roman armies to stop their progress, foreign mercenaries had</p>
<p>to be hired to fight the invader. As the foreign soldier happened</p>
<p>to be of the same blood as his supposed enemy, he was</p>
<p>apt to be quite lenient when he engaged in battle. Finally,</p>
<p>by way of experiment, a few tribes were allowed to settle</p>
<p>within the confines of the Empire. Others followed. Soon</p>
<p>these tribes complained bitterly of the greedy Roman tax-</p>
<p>gatherers, who took away their last penny. When they got</p>
<p>no redress they marched to Rome and loudly demanded that</p>
<p>they be heard.</p>
<p>This made Rome very uncomfortable as an Imperial residence.</p>
<p>Constantine (who ruled from 323 to 337) looked for</p>
<p>a new capital. He chose Byzantium, the gate-way for the</p>
<p>commerce between Europe and Asia. The city was renamed</p>
<p>Constantinople, and the court moved eastward. When Constantine</p>
<p>died, his two sons, for the sake of a more efficient</p>
<p>administration, divided the Empire between them. The elder</p>
<p>lived in Rome and ruled in the west. The younger stayed in</p>
<p>Constantinople and was master of the east.</p>
<p>Then came the fourth century and the terrible visitation</p>
<p>of the Huns, those mysterious Asiatic horsemen who for more</p>
<p>than two centuries maintained themselves in Northern Europe</p>
<p>and continued their career of bloodshed until they were defeated</p>
<p>near Chalons-sur-Marne in France in the year 451.</p>
<p>As soon as the Huns had reached the Danube they had begun</p>
<p>to press hard upon the Goths. The Goths, in order to save</p>
<p>themselves, were thereupon obliged to invade Rome. The</p>
<p>Emperor Valens tried to stop them, but was killed near</p>
<p>Adrianople in the year 378. Twenty-two years later, under</p>
<p>their king, Alaric, these same West Goths marched westward</p>
<p>and attacked Rome. They did not plunder, and destroyed</p>
<p>only a few palaces. Next came the Vandals, and showed less</p>
<p>respect for the venerable traditions of the city. Then the</p>
<p>Burgundians. Then the East Goths. Then the Alemanni.</p>
<p>Then the Franks. There was no end to the invasions. Rome</p>
<p>at last was at the mercy of every ambitious highway robber</p>
<p>who could gather a few followers.</p>
<p>In the year 402 the Emperor fled to Ravenna, which was</p>
<p>a sea-port and strongly fortified, and there, in the year 475,</p>
<p>Odoacer, commander of a regiment of the German mercenaries,</p>
<p>who wanted the farms of Italy to be divided among themselves,</p>
<p>gently but effectively pushed Romulus Augustulus, the</p>
<p>last of the emperors who ruled the western division, from his</p>
<p>throne, and proclaimed himself Patriarch or ruler of Rome.</p>
<p>The eastern Emperor, who was very busy with his own affairs,</p>
<p>recognised him, and for ten years Odoacer ruled what was</p>
<p>left of the western provinces.</p>
<p>A few years later, Theodoric, King of the East Goths,</p>
<p>invaded the newly formed Patriciat, took Ravenna, murdered</p>
<p>Odoacer at his own dinner table, and established a Gothic</p>
<p>Kingdom amidst the ruins of the western part of the Empire.</p>
<p>This Patriciate state did not last long. In the sixth century a</p>
<p>motley crowd of Longobards and Saxons and Slavs and Avars</p>
<p>invaded Italy, destroyed the Gothic kingdom, and established</p>
<p>a new state of which Pavia became the capital.</p>
<p>Then at last the imperial city sank into a state of utter</p>
<p>neglect and despair. The ancient palaces had been plundered</p>
<p>time and again. The schools had been burned down. The</p>
<p>teachers had been starved to death. The rich people had been</p>
<p>thrown out of their villas which were now inhabited by evil-</p>
<p>smelling and hairy barbarians. The roads had fallen into</p>
<p>decay. The old bridges were gone and commerce had come</p>
<p>to a standstill. Civilisation--the product of thousands of years</p>
<p>of patient labor on the part of Egyptians and Babylonians and</p>
<p>Greeks and Romans, which had lifted man high above the</p>
<p>most daring dreams of his earliest ancestors, threatened to</p>
<p>perish from the western continent.</p>
<p>It is true that in the far east, Constantinople continued to</p>
<p>be the centre of an Empire for another thousand years. But</p>
<p>it hardly counted as a part of the European continent. Its</p>
<p>interests lay in the east. It began to forget its western origin.</p>
<p>Gradually the Roman language was given up for the Greek.</p>
<p>The Roman alphabet was discarded and Roman law was written</p>
<p>in Greek characters and explained by Greek judges. The</p>
<p>Emperor became an Asiatic despot, worshipped as the god-like</p>
<p>kings of Thebes had been worshipped in the valley of the</p>
<p>Nile, three thousand years before. When missionaries of the</p>
<p>Byzantine church looked for fresh fields of activity, they went</p>
<p>eastward and carried the civilisation of Byzantium into the</p>
<p>vast wilderness of Russia.</p>
<p>As for the west, it was left to the mercies of the Barbarians.</p>
<p>For twelve generations, murder, war, arson, plundering were</p>
<p>the order of the day. One thing--and one thing alone--saved</p>
<p>Europe from complete destruction, from a return to the days</p>
<p>of cave-men and the hyena.</p>
<p>This was the church--the flock of humble men and women</p>
<p>who for many centuries had confessed themselves the followers</p>
<p>of Jesus, the carpenter of Nazareth, who had been</p>
<p>killed that the mighty Roman Empire might be saved the</p>
<p>trouble of a street-riot in a little city somewhere along the</p>
<p>Syrian frontier.</p>
<p>RISE OF THE CHURCH</p>
<p>HOW ROME BECAME THE CENTRE OF THE</p>
<p>CHRISTIAN WORLD</p>
<p>THE average intelligent Roman who lived under the Empire</p>
<p>had taken very little interest in the gods of his fathers.</p>
<p>A few times a year he went to the temple, but merely as a</p>
<p>matter of custom. He looked on patiently when the people</p>
<p>celebrated a religious festival with a solemn procession. But he</p>
<p>regarded the worship of Jupiter and Minerva and Neptune as</p>
<p>something rather childish, a survival from the crude days of</p>
<p>the early republic and not a fit subject of study for a man</p>
<p>who had mastered the works of the Stoics and the Epicureans</p>
<p>and the other great philosophers of Athens.</p>
<p>This attitude made the Roman a very tolerant man. The</p>
<p>government insisted that all people, Romans, foreigners,</p>
<p>Greeks, Babylonians, Jews, should pay a certain outward respect</p>
<p>to the image of the Emperor which was supposed to stand</p>
<p>in every temple, just as a picture of the President of the</p>
<p>United States is apt to hang in an American Post Office. But</p>
<p>this was a formality without any deeper meaning. Generally</p>
<p>speaking everybody could honour, revere and adore whatever</p>
<p>gods he pleased, and as a result, Rome was filled with all</p>
<p>sorts of queer little temples and synagogues, dedicated to the</p>
<p>worship of Egyptian and African and Asiatic divinities.</p>
<p>When the first disciples of Jesus reached Rome and began</p>
<p>to preach their new doctrine of a universal brotherhood of man,</p>
<p>nobody objected. The man in the street stopped and listened</p>
<p>Rome, the capital of the world, had always been full of wandering</p>
<p>preachers, each proclaiming his own ``mystery.&#x27;&#x27; Most of</p>
<p>the self-appointed priests appealed to the senses--promised</p>
<p>golden rewards and endless pleasure to the followers of their</p>
<p>own particular god. Soon the crowd in the street noticed</p>
<p>that the so-called Christians (the followers of the Christ or</p>
<p>``anointed&#x27;&#x27;) spoke a very different language. They did not</p>
<p>appear to be impressed by great riches or a noble position.</p>
<p>They extolled the beauties of poverty and humility and meekness.</p>
<p>These were not exactly the virtues which had made</p>
<p>Rome the mistress of the world. It was rather interesting to</p>
<p>listen to a ``mystery&#x27;&#x27; which told people in the hey-day of their</p>
<p>glory that their worldly success could not possibly bring them</p>
<p>lasting happiness.</p>
<p>Besides, the preachers of the Christian mystery told dreadful</p>
<p>stories of the fate that awaited those who refused to listen to</p>
<p>the words of the true God. It was never wise to take chances.</p>
<p>Of course the old Roman gods still existed, but were they</p>
<p>strong enough to protect their friends against the powers of</p>
<p>this new deity who had been brought to Europe from distant</p>
<p>Asia? People began to have doubts. They returned to listen</p>
<p>to further explanations of the new creed. After a while they</p>
<p>began to meet the men and women who preached the words of</p>
<p>Jesus. They found them very different from the average</p>
<p>Roman priests. They were all dreadfully poor. They were</p>
<p>kind to slaves and to animals. They did not try to gain riches,</p>
<p>but gave away whatever they had. The example of their unselfish</p>
<p>lives forced many Romans to forsake the old religion.</p>
<p>They joined the small communities of Christians who met in</p>
<p>the back rooms of private houses or somewhere in an open field,</p>
<p>and the temples were deserted.</p>
<p>This went on year after year and the number of Christians</p>
<p>continued to increase. Presbyters or priests (the original</p>
<p>Greek meant ``elder&#x27;&#x27;) were elected to guard the interests of</p>
<p>the small churches. A bishop was made the head of all the</p>
<p>communities within a single province. Peter, who had fol-</p>
<p>lowed Paul to Rome, was the first Bishop of Rome. In due</p>
<p>time his successors (who were addressed as Father or Papa)</p>
<p>came to be known as Popes.</p>
<p>The church became a powerful institution within the Empire.</p>
<p>The Christian doctrines appealed to those who despaired</p>
<p>of this world. They also attracted many strong men who</p>
<p>found it impossible to make a career under the Imperial gov-</p>
<p>ernment, but who could exercise their gifts of leadership among</p>
<p>the humble followers of the Nazarene teacher. At last the</p>
<p>state was obliged to take notice. The Roman Empire (I have</p>
<p>said this before) was tolerant through indifference. It allowed</p>
<p>everybody to seek salvation after his or her own fashion. But</p>
<p>it insisted that the different sects keep the peace among themselves</p>
<p>and obey the wise rule of ``live and let live.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The Christian communities however, refused to practice any</p>
<p>sort of tolerance. They publicly declared that their God, and</p>
<p>their God alone, was the true ruler of Heaven and Earth,</p>
<p>and that all other gods were imposters. This seemed unfair</p>
<p>to the other sects and the police discouraged such utterances.</p>
<p>The Christians persisted.</p>
<p>Soon there were further difficulties. The Christians refused</p>
<p>to go through the formalities of paying homage to the emperor.</p>
<p>They refused to appear when they were called upon</p>
<p>to join the army. The Roman magistrates threatened to</p>
<p>punish them. The Christians answered that this miserable</p>
<p>world was only the ante-room to a very pleasant Heaven and</p>
<p>that they were more than willing to suffer death for their</p>
<p>principles. The Romans, puzzled by such conduct, sometimes</p>
<p>killed the offenders, but more often they did not. There was</p>
<p>a certain amount of lynching during the earliest years of the</p>
<p>church, but this was the work of that part of the mob which</p>
<p>accused their meek Christian neighbours of every conceivable</p>
<p>crime, (such as slaughtering and eating babies, bringing about</p>
<p>sickness and pestilence, betraying the country in times of danger)</p>
<p>because it was a harmless sport and devoid of danger, as</p>
<p>the Christians refused to fight back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rome continued to be invaded by the Barbarians</p>
<p>and when her armies failed, Christian missionaries went</p>
<p>forth to preach their gospel of peace to the wild Teutons.</p>
<p>They were strong men without fear of death. They spoke a</p>
<p>language which left no doubt as to the future of unrepentant</p>
<p>sinners. The Teutons were deeply impressed. They still</p>
<p>had a deep respect for the wisdom of the ancient city of Rome.</p>
<p>Those men were Romans. They probably spoke the truth.</p>
<p>Soon the Christian missionary became a power in the savage</p>
<p>regions of the Teutons and the Franks. Half a dozen missionaries</p>
<p>were as valuable as a whole regiment of soldiers.</p>
<p>The Emperors began to understand that the Christian might</p>
<p>be of great use to them. In some of the provinces they were</p>
<p>given equal rights with those who remained faithful to the old</p>
<p>gods. The great change however came during the last half</p>
<p>of the fourth century.</p>
<p>Constantine, sometimes (Heaven knows why) called Constantine</p>
<p>the Great, was emperor. He was a terrible ruffian,</p>
<p>but people of tender qualities could hardly hope to survive</p>
<p>in that hard-fighting age. During a long and checkered career,</p>
<p>Constantine had experienced many ups and downs. Once,</p>
<p>when almost defeated by his enemies, he thought that he would</p>
<p>try the power of this new Asiatic deity of whom everybody was</p>
<p>talking. He promised that he too would become a Christian</p>
<p>if he were successful in the coming battle. He won the victory</p>
<p>and thereafter he was convinced of the power of the Christian</p>
<p>God and allowed himself to be baptised.</p>
<p>From that moment on, the Christian church was officially</p>
<p>recognised and this greatly strengthened the position of the</p>
<p>new faith.</p>
<p>But the Christians still formed a very small minority of</p>
<p>all the people, (not more than five or six percent,) and in order</p>
<p>to win, they were forced to refuse all compromise. The old</p>
<p>gods must be destroyed. For a short spell the emperor Julian,</p>
<p>a lover of Greek wisdom, managed to save the pagan Gods</p>
<p>from further destruction. But Julian died of his wounds during</p>
<p>a campaign in Persia and his successor Jovian re-established</p>
<p>the church in all its glory. One after the other the doors of the</p>
<p>ancient temples were then closed. Then came the emperor</p>
<p>Justinian (who built the church of Saint Sophia in Constantinople),</p>
<p>who discontinued the school of philosophy at Athens</p>
<p>which had been founded by Plato.</p>
<p>That was the end of the old Greek world, in which man</p>
<p>had been allowed to think his own thoughts and dream his own</p>
<p>dreams according to his desires. The somewhat vague rules</p>
<p>of conduct of the philosophers had proved a poor compass</p>
<p>by which to steer the ship of life after a deluge of savagery</p>
<p>and ignorance had swept away the established order of things.</p>
<p>There was need of something more positive and more definite.</p>
<p>This the Church provided.</p>
<p>During an age when nothing was certain, the church stood</p>
<p>like a rock and never receded from those principles which it</p>
<p>held to be true and sacred. This steadfast courage gained the</p>
<p>admiration of the multitudes and carried the church of Rome</p>
<p>safely through the difficulties which destroyed the Roman state.</p>
<p>There was however, a certain element of luck in the final</p>
<p>success of the Christian faith. After the disappearance of</p>
<p>Theodoric&#x27;s Roman-Gothic kingdom, in the fifth century,</p>
<p>Italy was comparatively free from foreign invasion. The</p>
<p>Lombards and Saxons and Slavs who succeeded the Goths were</p>
<p>weak and backward tribes. Under those circumstances it was</p>
<p>possible for the bishops of Rome to maintain the independence</p>
<p>of their city. Soon the remnants of the empire, scattered</p>
<p>throughout the peninsula, recognised the Dukes of Rome (or</p>
<p>bishops) as their political and spiritual rulers.</p>
<p>The stage was set for the appearance of a strong man.</p>
<p>He came in the year 590 and his name was Gregory. He belonged</p>
<p>to the ruling classes of ancient Rome, and he had</p>
<p>been ``prefect&#x27;&#x27; or mayor of the city. Then he had become</p>
<p>a monk and a bishop and finally, and much against his will,</p>
<p>(for he wanted to be a missionary and preach Christianity to</p>
<p>the heathen of England,) he had been dragged to the Church</p>
<p>of Saint Peter to be made Pope. He ruled only fourteen</p>
<p>years but when he died the Christian world of western Europe</p>
<p>had officially recognised the bishops of Rome, the Popes, as</p>
<p>the head of the entire church.</p>
<p>This power, however, did not extend to the east. In</p>
<p>Constantinople the Emperors continued the old custom which had</p>
<p>recognised the successors of Augustus and Tiberius both as</p>
<p>head of the government and as High Priest of the Established</p>
<p>Religion. In the year 1453 the eastern Roman Empire was</p>
<p>conquered by the Turks. Constantinople was taken, and Constantine</p>
<p>Paleologue, the last Roman Emperor, was killed on</p>
<p>the steps of the Church of the Holy Sophia.</p>
<p>A few years before, Zoe, the daughter of his brother</p>
<p>Thomas, had married Ivan III of Russia. In this way did the</p>
<p>grand-dukes of Moscow fall heir to the traditions of Constantinople.</p>
<p>The double-eagle of old Byzantium (reminiscent of</p>
<p>the days when Rome had been divided into an eastern and a</p>
<p>western part) became the coat of arms of modern Russia.</p>
<p>The Tsar who had been merely the first of the Russian nobles,</p>
<p>assumed the aloofness and the dignity of a Roman emperor</p>
<p>before whom all subjects, both high and low, were inconsiderable</p>
<p>slaves.</p>
<p>The court was refashioned after the oriental pattern which</p>
<p>the eastern Emperors had imported from Asia and from Egypt</p>
<p>and which (so they flattered themselves) resembled the court</p>
<p>of Alexander the Great. This strange inheritance which the</p>
<p>dying Byzantine Empire bequeathed to an unsuspecting world</p>
<p>continued to live with great vigour for six more centuries,</p>
<p>amidst the vast plains of Russia. The last man to wear the</p>
<p>crown with the double eagle of Constantinople, Tsar Nicholas,</p>
<p>was murdered only the other day, so to speak. His body was</p>
<p>thrown into a well. His son and his daughters were all killed.</p>
<p>All his ancient rights and prerogatives were abolished, and the</p>
<p>church was reduced to the position which it had held in Rome</p>
<p>before the days of Constantine.</p>
<p>The eastern church however fared very differently, as we</p>
<p>shall see in the next chapter when the whole Christian world is</p>
<p>going to be threatened with destruction by the rival creed of</p>
<p>an Arab camel-driver.</p>
<p>MOHAMMED</p>
<p>AHMED, THE CAMEL-DRIVER, WHO BECAME</p>
<p>THE PROPHET OF THE ARABIAN DESERT</p>
<p>AND WHOSE FOLLOWERS ALMOST</p>
<p>CONQUERED THE ENTIRE KNOWN WORLD</p>
<p>FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF ALLAH, THE</p>
<p>ONLY TRUE GOD</p>
<p>SINCE the days of Carthage and Hannibal we have said</p>
<p>nothing of the Semitic people. You will remember how they</p>
<p>filled all the chapters devoted to the story of the Ancient World.</p>
<p>The Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Phoenicians, the Jews,</p>
<p>the Arameans, the Chaldeans, all of them Semites, had been</p>
<p>the rulers of western Asia for thirty or forty centuries. They</p>
<p>had been conquered by the Indo-European Persians who had</p>
<p>come from the east and by the Indo-European Greeks who</p>
<p>had come from the west. A hundred years after the death of</p>
<p>Alexander the Great, Carthage, a colony of Semitic Phoenicians,</p>
<p>had fought the Indo-European Romans for the mastery</p>
<p>of the Mediterranean. Carthage had been defeated and destroyed</p>
<p>and for eight hundred years the Romans had been masters</p>
<p>of the world. In the seventh century, however, another</p>
<p>Semitic tribe appeared upon the scene and challenged the</p>
<p>power of the west. They were the Arabs, peaceful shepherds</p>
<p>who had roamed through the desert since the beginning of time</p>
<p>without showing any signs of imperial ambitions.</p>
<p>Then they listened to Mohammed, mounted their horses and</p>
<p>in less than a century they had pushed to the heart of Europe</p>
<p>and proclaimed the glories of Allah, ``the only God,&#x27;&#x27; and</p>
<p>Mohammed, ``the prophet of the only God,&#x27;&#x27; to the frightened</p>
<p>peasants of France.</p>
<p>The story of Ahmed, the son of Abdallah and Aminah</p>
<p>(usually known as Mohammed, or ``he who will be praised,&#x27;&#x27;;</p>
<p>reads like a chapter in the ``Thousand and One Nights.&#x27;&#x27; He</p>
<p>was a camel-driver, born in Mecca. He seems to have been an</p>
<p>epileptic and he suffered from spells of unconsciousness when</p>
<p>he dreamed strange dreams and heard the voice of the angel</p>
<p>Gabriel, whose words were afterwards written down in a book</p>
<p>called the Koran. His work as a caravan leader carried him</p>
<p>all over Arabia and he was constantly falling in with Jewish</p>
<p>merchants and with Christian traders, and he came to see that</p>
<p>the worship of a single God was a very excellent thing. His</p>
<p>own people, the Arabs, still revered queer stones and trunks</p>
<p>of trees as their ancestors had done, tens of thousands of</p>
<p>years before. In Mecca, their holy city, stood a little square</p>
<p>building, the Kaaba, full of idols and strange odds and ends</p>
<p>of Hoo-doo worship.</p>
<p>Mohammed decided to be the Moses of the Arab people. He</p>
<p>could not well be a prophet and a camel-driver at the same time.</p>
<p>So he made himself independent by marrying his employer, the</p>
<p>rich widow Chadija. Then he told his neighbours in Mecca</p>
<p>that he was the long-expected prophet sent by Allah to save the</p>
<p>world. The neighbours laughed most heartily and when Mohammed</p>
<p>continued to annoy them with his speeches they decided to kill him.</p>
<p>They regarded him as a lunatic and a public bore who deserved no mercy.</p>
<p>Mohammed heard of the plot and in the dark of night he fled to Medina</p>
<p>together with Abu Bekr, his trusted pupil. This happened</p>
<p>in the year 622. It is the most important date in Mohammedan</p>
<p>history and is known as the Hegira--the year of the Great Flight.</p>
<p>In Medina, Mohammed, who was a stranger, found it easier</p>
<p>to proclaim himself a prophet than in his home city, where</p>
<p>every one had known him as a simple camel-driver. Soon he</p>
<p>was surrounded by an increasing number of followers, or</p>
<p>Moslems, who accepted the Islam, ``the submission to the will</p>
<p>of God,&#x27;&#x27; which Mohammed praised as the highest of all virtues.</p>
<p>For seven years he preached to the people of Medina. Then</p>
<p>he believed himself strong enough to begin a campaign against</p>
<p>his former neighbours who had dared to sneer at him and his</p>
<p>Holy Mission in his old camel-driving days. At the head of</p>
<p>an army of Medinese he marched across the desert. His followers</p>
<p>took Mecca without great difficulty, and having slaughtered</p>
<p>a number of the inhabitants, they found it quite easy to</p>
<p>convince the others that Mohammed was really a great prophet.</p>
<p>From that time on until the year of his death, Mohammed</p>
<p>was fortunate in everything he undertook.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for the success of Islam. In the</p>
<p>first place, the creed which Mohammed taught to his followers</p>
<p>was very simple. The disciples were told that they must love</p>
<p>Allah, the Ruler of the World, the Merciful and Compassionate.</p>
<p>They must honour and obey their parents. They</p>
<p>were warned against dishonesty in dealing with their neighbours</p>
<p>and were admonished to be humble and charitable, to the</p>
<p>poor and to the sick. Finally they were ordered to abstain</p>
<p>from strong drink and to be very frugal in what they ate. That</p>
<p>was all. There were no priests, who acted as shepherds of</p>
<p>their flocks and asked that they be supported at the common</p>
<p>expense. The Mohammedan churches or mosques were merely</p>
<p>large stone halls without benches or pictures, where the faithful</p>
<p>could gather (if they felt so inclined) to read and discuss</p>
<p>chapters from the Koran, the Holy Book. But the average</p>
<p>Mohammedan carried his religion with him and never felt</p>
<p>himself hemmed in by the restrictions and regulations of an</p>
<p>established church. Five times a day he turned his face towards</p>
<p>Mecca, the Holy City, and said a simple prayer. For the</p>
<p>rest of the time he let Allah rule the world as he saw fit and</p>
<p>accepted whatever fate brought him with patient resignation.</p>
<p>Of course such an attitude towards life did not encourage</p>
<p>the Faithful to go forth and invent electrical machinery or</p>
<p>bother about railroads and steamship lines. But it gave every</p>
<p>Mohammedan a certain amount of contentment. It bade</p>
<p>him be at peace with himself and with the world in which he</p>
<p>lived and that was a very good thing.</p>
<p>The second reason which explains the success of the Moslems</p>
<p>in their warfare upon the Christians, had to do with the</p>
<p>conduct of those Mohammedan soldiers who went forth to do</p>
<p>battle for the true faith. The Prophet promised that those</p>
<p>who fell, facing the enemy, would go directly to Heaven.</p>
<p>This made sudden death in the field preferable to a long but</p>
<p>dreary existence upon this earth. It gave the Mohammedans</p>
<p>an enormous advantage over the Crusaders who were in constant</p>
<p>dread of a dark hereafter, and who stuck to the good</p>
<p>things of this world as long as they possibly could. Incidentally</p>
<p>it explains why even to-day Moslem soldiers will charge</p>
<p>into the fire of European machine guns quite indifferent to</p>
<p>the fate that awaits them and why they are such dangerous</p>
<p>and persistent enemies.</p>
<p>Having put his religious house in order, Mohammed now</p>
<p>began to enjoy his power as the undisputed ruler of a large</p>
<p>number of Arab tribes. But success has been the undoing of</p>
<p>a large number of men who were great in the days of adversity.</p>
<p>He tried to gain the good will of the rich people by a number</p>
<p>of regulations which could appeal to those of wealth.</p>
<p>He allowed the Faithful to have four wives. As one wife</p>
<p>was a costly investment in those olden days when brides were</p>
<p>bought directly from the parents, four wives became a positive</p>
<p>luxury except to those who possessed camels and dromedaries</p>
<p>and date orchards beyond the dreams of avarice. A religion</p>
<p>which at first had been meant for the hardy hunters of the</p>
<p>high skied desert was gradually transformed to suit the needs</p>
<p>of the smug merchants who lived in the bazaars of the cities.</p>
<p>It was a regrettable change from the original program and it</p>
<p>did very little good to the cause of Mohammedanism. As for</p>
<p>the prophet himself, he went on preaching the truth of Allah</p>
<p>and proclaiming new rules of conduct until he died, quite</p>
<p>suddenly, of a fever on June the seventh of the year 632.</p>
<p>His successor as Caliph (or leader) of the Moslems was</p>
<p>his father-in-law, Abu-Bekr, who had shared the early dangers</p>
<p>of the prophet&#x27;s life. Two years later, Abu-Bekr died and</p>
<p>Omar ibn Al-Khattab followed him. In less than ten years</p>
<p>he conquered Egypt, Persia, Phoenicia, Syria and Palestine</p>
<p>and made Damascus the capital of the first Mohammedan world</p>
<p>empire.</p>
<p>Omar was succeeded by Ali, the husband of Mohammed&#x27;s</p>
<p>daughter, Fatima, but a quarrel broke out upon a point of</p>
<p>Moslem doctrine and Ali was murdered. After his death,</p>
<p>the caliphate was made hereditary and the leaders of the faithful</p>
<p>who had begun their career as the spiritual head of a religious</p>
<p>sect became the rulers of a vast empire. They built</p>
<p>a new city on the shores of the Euphrates, near the ruins of</p>
<p>Babylon and called it Bagdad, and organising the Arab horsemen</p>
<p>into regiments of cavalry, they set forth to bring the</p>
<p>happiness of their Moslem faith to all unbelievers. In the</p>
<p>year 700 A.D. a Mohammedan general by the name of Tarik</p>
<p>crossed the old gates of Hercules and reached the high rock</p>
<p>on the European side which he called the Gibel-al-tarik, the</p>
<p>Hill of Tarik or Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Eleven years later in the battle of Xeres de la Frontera,</p>
<p>he defeated the king of the Visigoths and then the Moslem</p>
<p>army moved northward and following the route of Hannibal,</p>
<p>they crossed the passes of the Pyrenees. They defeated the</p>
<p>Duke of Aquitania, who tried to halt them near Bordeaux,</p>
<p>and marched upon Paris. But in the year 732 (one</p>
<p>hundred years after the death of the prophet,) they were</p>
<p>beaten in a battle between Tours and Poitiers. On that</p>
<p>day, Charles Martel (Charles with the Hammer) the Frankish</p>
<p>chieftain, saved Europe from a Mohammedan con-</p>
<p>quest. He drove the Moslems out of France, but they maintained</p>
<p>themselves in Spain where Abd-ar-Rahman founded the</p>
<p>Caliphate of Cordova, which became the greatest centre of</p>
<p>science and art of mediaeval Europe.</p>
<p>This Moorish kingdom, so-called because the people came</p>
<p>from Mauretania in Morocco, lasted seven centuries. It was</p>
<p>only after the capture of Granada, the last Moslem stronghold,</p>
<p>in the year 1492, that Columbus received the royal grant which</p>
<p>allowed him to go upon a voyage of discovery. The Mohammedans</p>
<p>soon regained their strength in the new conquests</p>
<p>which they made in Asia and Africa and to-day there are as</p>
<p>many followers of Mohammed as there are of Christ.</p>
<p>CHARLEMAGNE</p>
<p>HOW CHARLEMAGNE, THE KING OF THE</p>
<p>FRANKS, CAME TO BEAR THE TITLE OF</p>
<p>EMPEROR AND TRIED TO REVIVE THE OLD</p>
<p>IDEAL OF WORLD-EMPIRE</p>
<p>THE battle of Poitiers had saved Europe from the</p>
<p>Mohammedans. But the enemy within--the hopeless disorder</p>
<p>which had followed the disappearance of the Roman police</p>
<p>officer--that enemy remained. It is true that the new converts</p>
<p>of the Christian faith in Northern Europe felt a deep respect</p>
<p>for the mighty Bishop of Rome. But that poor bishop did</p>
<p>not feel any too safe when he looked toward the distant</p>
<p>mountains. Heaven knew what fresh hordes of barbarians were</p>
<p>ready to cross the Alps and begin a new attack on Rome. It</p>
<p>was necessary--very necessary--for the spiritual head of the</p>
<p>world to find an ally with a strong sword and a powerful</p>
<p>fist who was willing to defend His Holiness in case of danger.</p>
<p>And so the Popes, who were not only very holy but</p>
<p>also very practical, cast about for a friend, and presently</p>
<p>they made overtures to the most promising of the Germanic</p>
<p>tribes who had occupied north-western Europe after the fall</p>
<p>of Rome. They were called the Franks. One of their earliest</p>
<p>kings, called Merovech, had helped the Romans in the battle of</p>
<p>the Catalaunian fields in the year 451 when they defeated the</p>
<p>Huns. His descendants, the Merovingians, had continued to</p>
<p>take little bits of imperial territory until the year 486 when</p>
<p>king Clovis (the old French word for ``Louis&#x27;&#x27;) felt himself</p>
<p>strong enough to beat the Romans in the open. But his</p>
<p>descendants were weak men who left the affairs of state to</p>
<p>their Prime minister, the ``Major Domus&#x27;&#x27; or Master of the</p>
<p>Palace.</p>
<p>Pepin the Short, the son of the famous Charles Martel,</p>
<p>who succeeded his father as Master of the Palace, hardly</p>
<p>knew how to handle the situation. His royal master was a</p>
<p>devout theologian, without any interest in politics. Pepin</p>
<p>asked the Pope for advice. The Pope who was a practical</p>
<p>person answered that the ``power in the state belonged to him</p>
<p>who was actually possessed of it.&#x27;&#x27; Pepin took the hint. He</p>
<p>persuaded Childeric, the last of the Merovingians to become</p>
<p>a monk and then made himself king with the approval of the</p>
<p>other Germanic chieftains. But this did not satisfy the shrewd</p>
<p>Pepin. He wanted to be something more than a barbarian</p>
<p>chieftain. He staged an elaborate ceremony at which Boniface,</p>
<p>the great missionary of the European northwest, anointed</p>
<p>him and made him a ``King by the grace of God.&#x27;&#x27; It was</p>
<p>easy to slip those words, ``Del gratia,&#x27;&#x27; into the coronation</p>
<p>service. It took almost fifteen hundred years to get them out</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p>Pepin was sincerely grateful for this kindness on the part</p>
<p>of the church. He made two expeditions to Italy to defend</p>
<p>the Pope against his enemies. He took Ravenna and several</p>
<p>other cities away from the Longobards and presented them</p>
<p>to His Holiness, who incorporated these new domains into</p>
<p>the so-called Papal State, which remained an independent</p>
<p>country until half a century ago.</p>
<p>After Pepin&#x27;s death, the relations between Rome and Aix-</p>
<p>la-Chapelle or Nymwegen or Ingelheim, (the Frankish Kings</p>
<p>did not have one official residence, but travelled from place to</p>
<p>place with all their ministers and court officers,) became more</p>
<p>and more cordial. Finally the Pope and the King took a step</p>
<p>which was to influence the history of Europe in a most profound</p>
<p>way.</p>
<p>Charles, commonly known as Carolus Magnus or Char-</p>
<p>lemagne, succeeded Pepin in the year 768. He had conquered</p>
<p>the land of the Saxons in eastern Germany and had</p>
<p>built towns and monasteries all over the greater part of northern</p>
<p>Europe. At the request of certain enemies of Abd-ar-</p>
<p>Rahman, he had invaded Spain to fight the Moors. But in</p>
<p>the Pyrenees he had been attacked by the wild Basques and</p>
<p>had been forced to retire. It was upon this occasion that Roland,</p>
<p>the great Margrave of Breton, showed what a Frankish</p>
<p>chieftain of those early days meant when he promised to be</p>
<p>faithful to his King, and gave his life and that of his trusted</p>
<p>followers to safeguard the retreat of the royal army.</p>
<p>During the last ten years of the eighth century, however,</p>
<p>Charles was obliged to devote himself exclusively to affairs of</p>
<p>the South. The Pope, Leo III, had been attacked by a band</p>
<p>of Roman rowdies and had been left for dead in the street.</p>
<p>Some kind people had bandaged his wounds and had helped</p>
<p>him to escape to the camp of Charles, where he asked for</p>
<p>help. An army of Franks soon restored quiet and carried Leo</p>
<p>back to the Lateran Palace which ever since the days of Constantine,</p>
<p>had been the home of the Pope. That was in December</p>
<p>of the year 799. On Christmas day of the next year,</p>
<p>Charlemagne, who was staying in Rome, attended the service</p>
<p>in the ancient church of St. Peter. When he arose from prayer,</p>
<p>the Pope placed a crown upon his head, called him Emperor of</p>
<p>the Romans and hailed him once more with the title of ``Augustus&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>which had not been heard for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Once more Northern Europe was part of a Roman Empire,</p>
<p>but the dignity was held by a German chieftain who could</p>
<p>read just a little and never learned to write. But he could</p>
<p>fight and for a short while there was order and even the rival</p>
<p>emperor in Constantinople sent a letter of approval to his</p>
<p>``dear Brother.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Unfortunately this splendid old man died in the year 814.</p>
<p>His sons and his grandsons at once began to fight for the</p>
<p>largest share of the imperial inheritance. Twice the Carolingian</p>
<p>lands were divided, by the treaties of Verdun in the</p>
<p>year 843 and by the treaty of Mersen-on-the-Meuse in the</p>
<p>year 870. The latter treaty divided the entire Frankish Kingdom</p>
<p>into two parts. Charles the Bold received the western</p>
<p>half. It contained the old Roman province called Gaul where</p>
<p>the language of the people had become thoroughly romanized.</p>
<p>The Franks soon learned to speak this language and this</p>
<p>accounts for the strange fact that a purely Germanic land</p>
<p>like France should speak a Latin tongue.</p>
<p>The other grandson got the eastern part, the land which</p>
<p>the Romans had called Germania. Those inhospitable regions</p>
<p>had never been part of the old Empire. Augustus had</p>
<p>tried to conquer this ``far east,&#x27;&#x27; but his legions had been</p>
<p>annihilated in the Teutoburg Wood in the year 9 and the people had</p>
<p>never been influenced by the higher Roman civilisation. They</p>
<p>spoke the popular Germanic tongue. The Teuton word for</p>
<p><code>people&#x27;&#x27; was </code>thiot.&#x27;&#x27; The Christian missionaries therefore</p>
<p>called the German language the ``lingua theotisca&#x27;&#x27; or the</p>
<p><code>lingua teutisca,&#x27;&#x27; the </code>popular dialect&#x27;&#x27; and this word</p>
<p><code>teutisca&#x27;&#x27; was changed into </code>Deutsch&#x27;&#x27; which accounts for the name</p>
<p>``Deutschland.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>As for the famous Imperial Crown, it very soon slipped</p>
<p>off the heads of the Carolingian successors and rolled back onto</p>
<p>the Italian plain, where it became a sort of plaything of a</p>
<p>number of little potentates who stole the crown from each other</p>
<p>amidst much bloodshed and wore it (with or without the permission</p>
<p>of the Pope) until it was the turn of some more ambitious</p>
<p>neighbour. The Pope, once more sorely beset by his</p>
<p>enemies, sent north for help. He did not appeal to the ruler</p>
<p>of the west-Frankish kingdom, this time. His messengers</p>
<p>crossed the Alps and addressed themselves to Otto, a Saxon</p>
<p>Prince who was recognised as the greatest chieftain of the</p>
<p>different Germanic tribes.</p>
<p>Otto, who shared his people&#x27;s affection for the blue skies</p>
<p>and the gay and beautiful people of the Italian peninsula,</p>
<p>hastened to the rescue. In return for his services, the Pope,</p>
<p>Leo VIII, made Otto ``Emperor,&#x27;&#x27; and the eastern half of</p>
<p>Charles&#x27; old kingdom was henceforth known as the ``Holy</p>
<p>Roman Empire of the German Nation.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>This strange political creation managed to live to the ripe</p>
<p>old age of eight hundred and thirty-nine years. In the year</p>
<p>1801, (during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson,) it was</p>
<p>most unceremoniously relegated to the historical scrapheap.</p>
<p>The brutal fellow who destroyed the old Germanic Empire was</p>
<p>the son of a Corsican notary-public who had made a brilliant</p>
<p>career in the service of the French Republic. He was ruler</p>
<p>of Europe by the grace of his famous Guard Regiments, but</p>
<p>he desired to be something more. He sent to Rome for the</p>
<p>Pope and the Pope came and stood by while General Napoleon</p>
<p>placed the imperial crown upon his own head and proclaimed</p>
<p>himself heir to the tradition of Charlemagne. For history is</p>
<p>like life. The more things change, the more they remain</p>
<p>the same.</p>
<p>THE NORSEMEN</p>
<p>WHY THE PEOPLE OF THE TENTH CENTURY</p>
<p>PRAYED THE LORD TO PROTECT THEM</p>
<p>FROM THE FURY OF THE NORSEMEN</p>
<p>IN the third and fourth centuries, the Germanic tribes of</p>
<p>central Europe had broken through the defences of the Empire</p>
<p>that they might plunder Rome and live on the fat of the</p>
<p>land. In the eighth century it became the turn of the Germans</p>
<p>to be the ``plundered-ones.&#x27;&#x27; They did not like this at all, even</p>
<p>if their enemies were their first cousins, the Norsemen, who</p>
<p>lived in Denmark and Sweden and Norway.</p>
<p>What forced these hardy sailors to turn pirate we do not</p>
<p>know, but once they had discovered the advantages and pleasures</p>
<p>of a buccaneering career there was no one who could stop</p>
<p>them. They would suddenly descend upon a peaceful Frankish</p>
<p>or Frisian village, situated on the mouth of a river. They</p>
<p>would kill all the men and steal all the women. Then they</p>
<p>would sail away in their fast-sailing ships and when the soldiers</p>
<p>of the king or emperor arrived upon the scene, the robbers</p>
<p>were gone and nothing remained but a few smouldering</p>
<p>ruins.</p>
<p>During the days of disorder which followed the death of</p>
<p>Charlemagne, the Northmen developed great activity. Their</p>
<p>fleets made raids upon every country and their sailors established</p>
<p>small independent kingdoms along the coast of Holland</p>
<p>and France and England and Germany, and they even found</p>
<p>their way into Italy. The Northmen were very intelligent</p>
<p>They soon learned to speak the language of their subjects and</p>
<p>gave up the uncivilised ways of the early Vikings (or Sea-</p>
<p>Kings who had been very picturesque but also very unwashed</p>
<p>and terribly cruel.</p>
<p>Early in the tenth century a Viking by the name of Rollo</p>
<p>had repeatedly attacked the coast of France. The king of</p>
<p>France, too weak to resist these northern robbers, tried to</p>
<p>bribe them into ``being good.&#x27;&#x27; He offered them the province</p>
<p>of Normandy, if they would promise to stop bothering the rest</p>
<p>of his domains. Rollo accepted this bargain and became ``Duke</p>
<p>of Normandy.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>But the passion of conquest was strong in the blood of his</p>
<p>children. Across the channel, only a few hours away from the</p>
<p>European mainland, they could see the white cliffs and the</p>
<p>green fields of England. Poor England had passed through</p>
<p>difficult days. For two hundred years it had been a Roman</p>
<p>colony. After the Romans left, it had been conquered by the</p>
<p>Angles and the Saxons, two German tribes from Schleswig.</p>
<p>Next the Danes had taken the greater part of the country</p>
<p>and had established the kingdom of Cnut. The Danes had</p>
<p>been driven away and now (it was early in the eleventh century)</p>
<p>another Saxon king, Edward the Confessor, was on the</p>
<p>throne. But Edward was not expected to live long and he</p>
<p>had no children. The circumstances favoured the ambitious</p>
<p>dukes of Normandy.</p>
<p>In 1066 Edward died. Immediately William of Normandy</p>
<p>crossed the channel, defeated and killed Harold of</p>
<p>Wessex (who had taken the crown) at the battle of Hastings,</p>
<p>and proclaimed himself king of England.</p>
<p>In another chapter I have told you how in the year 800 a</p>
<p>German chieftain had become a Roman Emperor. Now in</p>
<p>the year 1066 the grandson of a Norse pirate was recognised</p>
<p>as King of England.</p>
<p>Why should we ever read fairy stories, when the truth</p>
<p>of history is so much more interesting and entertaining?</p>
<p>FEUDALISM</p>
<p>HOW CENTRAL EUROPE, ATTACKED FROM</p>
<p>THREE SIDES, BECAME AN ARMED CAMP</p>
<p>AND WHY EUROPE WOULD HAVE PERISHED</p>
<p>WITHOUT THOSE PROFESSIONAL</p>
<p>SOLDIERS AND ADMINISTRATORS WHO</p>
<p>WERE PART OF THE FEUDAL SYSTEM</p>
<p>THE following, then, is the state of Europe in the year one</p>
<p>thousand, when most people were so unhappy that they welcomed</p>
<p>the prophecy foretelling the approaching end of the</p>
<p>world and rushed to the monasteries, that the Day of Judgement</p>
<p>might find them engaged upon devout duties.</p>
<p>At an unknown date, the Germanic tribes had left their old</p>
<p>home in Asia and had moved westward into Europe. By</p>
<p>sheer pressure of numbers they had forced their way into the</p>
<p>Roman Empire. They had destroyed the great western empire,</p>
<p>but the eastern part, being off the main route of the</p>
<p>great migrations, had managed to survive and feebly continued</p>
<p>the traditions of Rome&#x27;s ancient glory.</p>
<p>During the days of disorder which had followed, (the true</p>
<p>``dark ages&#x27;&#x27; of history, the sixth and seventh centuries of our</p>
<p>era,) the German tribes had been persuaded to accept the</p>
<p>Christian religion and had recognised the Bishop of Rome</p>
<p>as the Pope or spiritual head of the world. In the ninth century,</p>
<p>the organising genius of Charlemagne had revived the</p>
<p>Roman Empire and had united the greater part of western</p>
<p>Europe into a single state. During the tenth century this</p>
<p>empire had gone to pieces. The western part had become a</p>
<p>separate kingdom, France. The eastern half was known as the</p>
<p>Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, and the rulers of</p>
<p>this federation of states then pretended that they were the</p>
<p>direct heirs of Caesar and Augustus.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the power of the kings of France did not</p>
<p>stretch beyond the moat of their royal residence, while the</p>
<p>Holy Roman Emperor was openly defied by his powerful</p>
<p>subjects whenever it suited their fancy or their profit.</p>
<p>To increase the misery of the masses of the people, the</p>
<p>triangle of western Europe (look at page 128, please) was for ever</p>
<p>exposed to attacks from three sides. On the south lived the</p>
<p>ever dangerous Mohammedans. The western coast was ravaged</p>
<p>by the Northmen. The eastern frontier (defenceless except</p>
<p>for the short stretch of the Carpathian mountains) was at</p>
<p>the mercy of hordes of Huns, Hungarians, Slavs and Tartars.</p>
<p>The peace of Rome was a thing of the remote past, a dream</p>
<p>of the ``Good Old Days&#x27;&#x27; that were gone for ever. It was a</p>
<p>question of ``fight or die,&#x27;&#x27; and quite naturally people preferred</p>
<p>to fight. Forced by circumstances, Europe became an armed</p>
<p>camp and there was a demand for strong leadership. Both</p>
<p>King and Emperor were far away. The frontiersmen (and</p>
<p>most of Europe in the year 1000 was ``frontier&#x27;&#x27;) must help</p>
<p>themselves. They willingly submitted to the representatives</p>
<p>of the king who were sent to administer the outlying districts,</p>
<p>PROVIDED THEY COULD PROTECT THEM AGAINST THEIR ENEMIES.</p>
<p>Soon central Europe was dotted with small principalities,</p>
<p>each one ruled by a duke or a count or a baron or a bishop, as</p>
<p>the case might be, and organised as a fighting unit. These</p>
<p>dukes and counts and barons had sworn to be faithful to the</p>
<p>king who had given them their ``feudum&#x27;&#x27; (hence our word</p>
<p>``feudal,&#x27;&#x27;) in return for their loyal services and a certain</p>
<p>amount of taxes. But travel in those days was slow and the</p>
<p>means of communication were exceedingly poor. The royal</p>
<p>or imperial administrators therefore enjoyed great independence,</p>
<p>and within the boundaries of their own province they</p>
<p>assumed most of the rights which in truth belonged to the king.</p>
<p>But you would make a mistake if you supposed that the</p>
<p>people of the eleventh century objected to this form of</p>
<p>government. They supported Feudalism because it was a very</p>
<p>practical and necessary institution. Their Lord and Master</p>
<p>usually lived in a big stone house erected on the top of a steep</p>
<p>rock or built between deep moats, but within sight of his</p>
<p>subjects. In case of danger the subjects found shelter behind</p>
<p>the walls of the baronial stronghold. That is why they tried</p>
<p>to live as near the castle as possible and it accounts for the</p>
<p>many European cities which began their career around a feudal</p>
<p>fortress.</p>
<p>But the knight of the early middle ages was much more</p>
<p>than a professional soldier. He was the civil servant of that</p>
<p>day. He was the judge of his community and he was the</p>
<p>chief of police. He caught the highwaymen and protected</p>
<p>the wandering pedlars who were the merchants of the eleventh</p>
<p>century. He looked after the dikes so that the countryside</p>
<p>should not be flooded (just as the first noblemen had done</p>
<p>in the valley of the Nile four thousand years before). He</p>
<p>encouraged the Troubadours who wandered from place to place</p>
<p>telling the stories of the ancient heroes who had fought in the</p>
<p>great wars of the migrations. Besides, he protected the churches</p>
<p>and the monasteries within his territory, and although he could</p>
<p>neither read nor write, (it was considered unmanly to know</p>
<p>such things,) he employed a number of priests who kept his</p>
<p>accounts and who registered the marriages and the births and</p>
<p>the deaths which occurred within the baronial or ducal domains.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth century the kings once more became strong</p>
<p>enough to exercise those powers which belonged to them because</p>
<p>they were ``anointed of God.&#x27;&#x27; Then the feudal knights lost</p>
<p>their former independence. Reduced to the rank of country</p>
<p>squires, they no longer filled a need and soon they became a</p>
<p>nuisance. But Europe would have perished without the ``feudal</p>
<p>system&#x27;&#x27; of the dark ages. There were many bad knights</p>
<p>as there are many bad people to-day. But generally speaking,</p>
<p>the rough-fisted barons of the twelfth and thirteenth century</p>
<p>were hard-working administrators who rendered a most useful</p>
<p>service to the cause of progress. During that era the noble</p>
<p>torch of learning and art which had illuminated the world of</p>
<p>the Egyptians and the Greeks and the Romans was burning</p>
<p>very low. Without the knights and their good friends, the</p>
<p>monks, civilisation would have been extinguished entirely, and</p>
<p>the human race would have been forced to begin once more</p>
<p>where the cave-man had left off.</p>
<p>CHIVALRY</p>
<p>CHIVALRY</p>
<p>IT was quite natural that the professional fighting-men of</p>
<p>the Middle Ages should try to establish some sort of organisation</p>
<p>for their mutual benefit and protection. Out of this need</p>
<p>for close organisation, Knighthood or Chivalry was born.</p>
<p>We know very little about the origins of Knighthood. But</p>
<p>as the system developed, it gave the world something which it</p>
<p>needed very badly--a definite rule of conduct which softened</p>
<p>the barbarous customs of that day and made life more livable</p>
<p>than it had been during the five hundred years of the Dark</p>
<p>Ages. It was not an easy task to civilise the rough frontiersmen</p>
<p>who had spent most of their time fighting Mohammedans</p>
<p>and Huns and Norsemen. Often they were guilty of backsliding,</p>
<p>and having vowed all sorts of oaths about mercy and</p>
<p>charity in the morning, they would murder all their prisoners</p>
<p>before evening. But progress is ever the result of slow and</p>
<p>ceaseless labour, and finally the most unscrupulous of knights</p>
<p>was forced to obey the rules of his ``class&#x27;&#x27; or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>These rules were different in the various parts of Europe,</p>
<p>but they all made much of <code>service&#x27;&#x27; and </code>loyalty to duty.&#x27;&#x27; The</p>
<p>Middle Ages regarded service as something very noble and</p>
<p>beautiful. It was no disgrace to be a servant, provided you</p>
<p>were a good servant and did not slacken on the job. As for</p>
<p>loyalty, at a time when life depended upon the faithful per-</p>
<p>formance of many unpleasant duties, it was the chief virtue</p>
<p>of the fighting man.</p>
<p>A young knight therefore was asked to swear that he would</p>
<p>be faithful as a servant to God and as a servant to his King.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he promised to be generous to those whose need</p>
<p>was greater than his own. He pledged his word that he would</p>
<p>be humble in his personal behaviour and would never boast of</p>
<p>his own accomplishments and that he would be a friend of all</p>
<p>those who suffered, (with the exception of the Mohammedans,</p>
<p>whom he was expected to kill on sight).</p>
<p>Around these vows, which were merely the Ten Commandments</p>
<p>expressed in terms which the people of the Middle Ages</p>
<p>could understand, there developed a complicated system of</p>
<p>manners and outward behaviour. The knights tried to model</p>
<p>their own lives after the example of those heroes of Arthur&#x27;s</p>
<p>Round Table and Charlemagne&#x27;s court of whom the Troubadours</p>
<p>had told them and of whom you may read in many delightful</p>
<p>books which are enumerated at the end of this volume.</p>
<p>They hoped that they might prove as brave as Lancelot and</p>
<p>as faithful as Roland. They carried themselves with dignity</p>
<p>and they spoke careful and gracious words that they might be</p>
<p>known as True Knights, however humble the cut of their coat</p>
<p>or the size of their purse.</p>
<p>In this way the order of Knighthood became a school of those</p>
<p>good manners which are the oil of the social machinery. Chivalry</p>
<p>came to mean courtesy and the feudal castle showed the</p>
<p>rest of the world what clothes to wear, how to eat, how to ask</p>
<p>a lady for a dance and the thousand and one little things of</p>
<p>every-day behaviour which help to make life interesting and</p>
<p>agreeable.</p>
<p>Like all human institutions, Knighthood was doomed to</p>
<p>perish as soon as it had outlived its usefulness.</p>
<p>The crusades, about which one of the next chapters tells,</p>
<p>were followed by a great revival of trade. Cities grew overnight.</p>
<p>The townspeople became rich, hired good school teachers</p>
<p>and soon were the equals of the knights. The invention</p>
<p>of gun-powder deprived the heavily armed ``Chevalier&#x27;&#x27; of his</p>
<p>former advantage and the use of mercenaries made it impossible</p>
<p>to conduct a battle with the delicate niceties of a chess</p>
<p>tournament. The knight became superfluous. Soon he became</p>
<p>a ridiculous figure, with his devotion to ideals that had no</p>
<p>longer any practical value. It was said that the noble Don</p>
<p>Quixote de la Mancha had been the last of the true knights.</p>
<p>After his death, his trusted sword and his armour were sold</p>
<p>to pay his debts.</p>
<p>But somehow or other that sword seems to have fallen into</p>
<p>the hands of a number of men. Washington carried it during</p>
<p>the hopeless days of Valley Forge. It was the only defence</p>
<p>of Gordon, when he had refused to desert the people who had</p>
<p>been entrusted to his care, and stayed to meet his death in the</p>
<p>besieged fortress of Khartoum.</p>
<p>And I am not quite sure but that it proved of invaluable</p>
<p>strength in winning the Great War.</p>
<p>POPE vs. EMPEROR</p>
<p>THE STRANGE DOUBLE LOYALTY OF THE</p>
<p>PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES AND HOW</p>
<p>IT LED TO ENDLESS QUARRELS BETWEEN</p>
<p>THE POPES AND THE HOLY ROMAN EMPERORS</p>
<p>IT is very difficult to understand the people of by-gone</p>
<p>ages. Your own grandfather, whom you see every day, is a</p>
<p>mysterious being who lives in a different world of ideas and</p>
<p>clothes and manners. I am now telling you the story of some</p>
<p>of your grandfathers who are twenty-five generations removed,</p>
<p>and I do not expect you to catch the meaning of what I write</p>
<p>without re-reading this chapter a number of times.</p>
<p>The average man of the Middle Ages lived a very simple</p>
<p>and uneventful life. Even if he was a free citizen, able to</p>
<p>come and go at will, he rarely left his own neighbourhood.</p>
<p>There were no printed books and only a few manuscripts.</p>
<p>Here and there, a small band of industrious monks taught</p>
<p>reading and writing and some arithmetic. But science and history</p>
<p>and geography lay buried beneath the ruins of Greece and</p>
<p>Rome.</p>
<p>Whatever people knew about the past they had learned by</p>
<p>listening to stories and legends. Such information, which goes</p>
<p>from father to son, is often slightly incorrect in details, but</p>
<p>it will preserve the main facts of history with astonishing</p>
<p>accuracy. After more than two thousand years, the mothers of</p>
<p>India still frighten their naughty children by telling them that</p>
<p>``Iskander will get them,&#x27;&#x27; and Iskander is none other than</p>
<p>Alexander the Great, who visited India in the year 330 before</p>
<p>the birth of Christ, but whose story has lived through all these</p>
<p>ages.</p>
<p>The people of the early Middle Ages never saw a textbook</p>
<p>of Roman history. They were ignorant of many things</p>
<p>which every school-boy to-day knows before he has entered</p>
<p>the third grade. But the Roman Empire, which is merely a</p>
<p>name to you, was to them something very much alive. They</p>
<p>felt it. They willingly recognised the Pope as their spiritual</p>
<p>leader because he lived in Rome and represented the idea of</p>
<p>the Roman super-power. And they were profoundly grateful</p>
<p>when Charlemagne, and afterwards Otto the Great, revived</p>
<p>the idea of a world-empire and created the Holy Roman</p>
<p>Empire, that the world might again be as it always had been.</p>
<p>But the fact that there were two different heirs to the</p>
<p>Roman tradition placed the faithful burghers of the Middle</p>
<p>Ages in a difficult position. The theory behind the mediaeval</p>
<p>political system was both sound and simple. While the worldly</p>
<p>master (the emperor) looked after the physical well-being of</p>
<p>his subjects, the spiritual master (the Pope) guarded their</p>
<p>souls.</p>
<p>In practice, however, the system worked very badly. The</p>
<p>Emperor invariably tried to interfere with the affairs of the</p>
<p>church and the Pope retaliated and told the Emperor how</p>
<p>he should rule his domains. Then they told each other to mind</p>
<p>their own business in very unceremonious language and the</p>
<p>inevitable end was war.</p>
<p>Under those circumstances, what were the people to do,</p>
<p>A good Christian obeyed both the Pope and his King. But</p>
<p>the Pope and the Emperor were enemies. Which side should</p>
<p>a dutiful subject and an equally dutiful Christian take?</p>
<p>It was never easy to give the correct answer. When the</p>
<p>Emperor happened to be a man of energy and was sufficiently</p>
<p>well provided with money to organise an army, he was very</p>
<p>apt to cross the Alps and march on Rome, besiege the Pope</p>
<p>in his own palace if need be, and force His Holiness to obey</p>
<p>the imperial instructions or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>But more frequently the Pope was the stronger. Then the</p>
<p>Emperor or the King together with all his subjects was</p>
<p>excommunicated. This meant that all churches were closed, that no</p>
<p>one could be baptised, that no dying man could be given absolution--</p>
<p>in short, that half of the functions of mediaeval government</p>
<p>came to an end.</p>
<p>More than that, the people were absolved from their oath of</p>
<p>loyalty to their sovereign and were urged to rebel against their</p>
<p>master. But if they followed this advice of the distant Pope</p>
<p>and were caught, they were hanged by their near-by Lege</p>
<p>Lord and that too was very unpleasant.</p>
<p>Indeed, the poor fellows were in a difficult position and</p>
<p>none fared worse than those who lived during the latter half of</p>
<p>the eleventh century, when the Emperor Henry IV of Germany</p>
<p>and Pope Gregory VII fought a two-round battle which</p>
<p>decided nothing and upset the peace of Europe for almost fifty</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>In the middle of the eleventh century there had been a</p>
<p>strong movement for reform in the church. The election of the</p>
<p>Popes, thus far, had been a most irregular affair. It was to the</p>
<p>advantage of the Holy Roman Emperors to have a well-disposed</p>
<p>priest elected to the Holy See. They frequently came</p>
<p>to Rome at the time of election and used their influence for</p>
<p>the benefit of one of their friends.</p>
<p>In the year 1059 this had been changed. By a decree of</p>
<p>Pope Nicholas II the principal priests and deacons of the</p>
<p>churches in and around Rome were organised into the so-</p>
<p>called College of Cardinals, and this gathering of prominent</p>
<p>churchmen (the word ``Cardinal&#x27;&#x27; meant principal) was given</p>
<p>the exclusive power of electing the future Popes.</p>
<p>In the year 1073 the College of Cardinals elected a priest</p>
<p>by the name of Hildebrand, the son of very simple parents in</p>
<p>Tuscany, as Pope, and he took the name of Gregory VII.</p>
<p>His energy was unbounded. His belief in the supreme powers</p>
<p>of his Holy Office was built upon a granite rock of conviction</p>
<p>and courage. In the mind of Gregory, the Pope was not only</p>
<p>the absolute head of the Christian church, but also the highest</p>
<p>Court of Appeal in all worldly matters. The Pope who had</p>
<p>elevated simple German princes to the dignity of Emperor</p>
<p>could depose them at will. He could veto any law passed by</p>
<p>duke or king or emperor, but whosoever should question a</p>
<p>papal decree, let him beware, for the punishment would be</p>
<p>swift and merciless.</p>
<p>Gregory sent ambassadors to all the European courts to</p>
<p>inform the potentates of Europe of his new laws and asked</p>
<p>them to take due notice of their contents. William the Conqueror</p>
<p>promised to be good, but Henry IV, who since the age</p>
<p>of six had been fighting with his subjects, had no intention of</p>
<p>submitting to the Papal will. He called together a college of</p>
<p>German bishops, accused Gregory of every crime under the</p>
<p>sun and then had him deposed by the council of Worms.</p>
<p>The Pope answered with excommunication and a demand</p>
<p>that the German princes rid themselves of their unworthy ruler.</p>
<p>The German princes, only too happy to be rid of Henry, asked</p>
<p>the Pope to come to Augsburg and help them elect a new Emperor.</p>
<p>Gregory left Rome and travelled northward. Henry,</p>
<p>who was no fool, appreciated the danger of his position. At</p>
<p>all costs he must make peace with the Pope, and he must do</p>
<p>it at once. In the midst of winter he crossed the Alps and</p>
<p>hastened to Canossa where the Pope had stopped for a short</p>
<p>rest. Three long days, from the 25th to the 28th of January</p>
<p>of the year 1077, Henry, dressed as a penitent pilgrim</p>
<p>(but with a warm sweater underneath his monkish garb),</p>
<p>waited outside the gates of the castle of Canossa.</p>
<p>Then he was allowed to enter and was pardoned for</p>
<p>his sins. But the repentance did not last long.</p>
<p>As soon as Henry had returned to Germany, he behaved</p>
<p>exactly as before. Again he was excommunicated. For the</p>
<p>second time a council of German bishops deposed Gregory,</p>
<p>but this time, when Henry crossed the Alps he was at</p>
<p>the head of a large army, besieged Rome and forced Gregory</p>
<p>to retire to Salerno, where he died in exile. This first violent</p>
<p>outbreak decided nothing. As soon as Henry was back in</p>
<p>Germany, the struggle between Pope and Emperor was continued.</p>
<p>The Hohenstaufen family which got hold of the Imperial</p>
<p>German Throne shortly afterwards, were even more independent</p>
<p>than their predecessors. Gregory had claimed that the</p>
<p>Popes were superior to all kings because they (the Popes) at</p>
<p>the Day of Judgement would be responsible for the behaviour</p>
<p>of all the sheep of their flock, and in the eyes of God, a king</p>
<p>was one of that faithful herd.</p>
<p>Frederick of Hohenstaufen, commonly known as Barbarossa</p>
<p>or Red Beard, set up the counter-claim that the Empire</p>
<p>had been bestowed upon his predecessor ``by God himself&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>and as the Empire included Italy and Rome, he began a campaign</p>
<p>which was to add these ``lost provinces&#x27;&#x27; to the northern</p>
<p>country. Barbarossa was accidentally drowned in Asia Minor</p>
<p>during the second Crusade, but his son Frederick II, a brilliant</p>
<p>young man who in his youth had been exposed to the civilisation</p>
<p>of the Mohammedans of Sicily, continued the war. The</p>
<p>Popes accused him of heresy. It is true that Frederick seems</p>
<p>to have felt a deep and serious contempt for the rough Christian</p>
<p>world of the North, for the boorish German Knights and</p>
<p>the intriguing Italian priests. But he held his tongue, went</p>
<p>on a Crusade and took Jerusalem from the infidel and was</p>
<p>duly crowned as King of the Holy City. Even this act did not</p>
<p>placate the Popes. They deposed Frederick and gave his</p>
<p>Italian possessions to Charles of Anjou, the brother of that</p>
<p>King Louis of France who became famous as Saint Louis.</p>
<p>This led to more warfare. Conrad V, the son of Conrad IV,</p>
<p>and the last of the Hohenstaufens, tried to regain the kingdom,</p>
<p>and was defeated and decapitated at Naples. But twenty years</p>
<p>later, the French who had made themselves thoroughly unpopular</p>
<p>in Sicily were all murdered during the so-called Sicilian</p>
<p>Vespers, and so it went.</p>
<p>The quarrel between the Popes and the Emperors was</p>
<p>never settled, but after a while the two enemies learned to</p>
<p>leave each other alone.</p>
<p>In the year 1278, Rudolph of Hapsburg was elected Emperor.</p>
<p>He did not take the trouble to go to Rome to be</p>
<p>crowned. The Popes did not object and in turn they kept</p>
<p>away from Germany. This meant peace but two entire centuries</p>
<p>which might have been used for the purpose of internal</p>
<p>organisation had been wasted in useless warfare.</p>
<p>It is an ill wind however that bloweth no good to some one.</p>
<p>The little cities of Italy, by a process of careful balancing,</p>
<p>had managed to increase their power and their independence</p>
<p>at the expense of both Emperors and Popes. When the rush</p>
<p>for the Holy Land began, they were able to handle the transportation</p>
<p>problem of the thousands of eager pilgrims who were</p>
<p>clamoring for passage, and at the end of the Crusades they</p>
<p>had built themselves such strong defences of brick and of gold</p>
<p>that they could defy Pope and Emperor with equal indifference.</p>
<p>Church and State fought each other and a third party--the</p>
<p>mediaeval city--ran away with the spoils.</p>
<p>THE CRUSADES</p>
<p>BUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT QUARRELS</p>
<p>WERE FORGOTTEN WHEN THE TURKS</p>
<p>TOOK THE HOLY LAND, DESECRATED THE</p>
<p>HOLY PLACES AND INTERFERED SERIOUSLY</p>
<p>WITH THE TRADE FROM EAST TO</p>
<p>WEST. EUROPE WENT CRUSADING</p>
<p>DURING three centuries there had been peace between Christians</p>
<p>and Moslems except in Spain and in the eastern Roman</p>
<p>Empire, the two states defending the gateways of Europe.</p>
<p>The Mohammedans having conquered Syria in the seventh</p>
<p>century were in possession of the Holy Land. But they regarded</p>
<p>Jesus as a great prophet (though not quite as great</p>
<p>as Mohammed), and they did not interfere with the pilgrims</p>
<p>who wished to pray in the church which Saint Helena, the</p>
<p>mother of the Emperor Constantine, had built on the spot of</p>
<p>the Holy Grave. But early in the eleventh century, a Tartar</p>
<p>tribe from the wilds of Asia, called the Seljuks or Turks,</p>
<p>became masters of the Mohammedan state in western Asia and</p>
<p>then the period of tolerance came to an end. The Turks took</p>
<p>all of Asia Minor away from the eastern Roman Emperors</p>
<p>and they made an end to the trade between east and west.</p>
<p>Alexis, the Emperor, who rarely saw anything of his Christian</p>
<p>neighbours of the west, appealed for help and pointed to</p>
<p>the danger which threatened Europe should the Turks take</p>
<p>Constantinople.</p>
<p>The Italian cities which had established colonies along the</p>
<p>coast of Asia Minor and Palestine, in fear for their possessions,</p>
<p>reported terrible stories of Turkish atrocities and Christian</p>
<p>suffering. All Europe got excited.</p>
<p>Pope Urban II, a Frenchman from Reims, who had been</p>
<p>educated at the same famous cloister of Cluny which had</p>
<p>trained Gregory VII, thought that the time had come for</p>
<p>action. The general state of Europe was far from satisfactory.</p>
<p>The primitive agricultural methods of that day (unchanged</p>
<p>since Roman times) caused a constant scarcity of food. There</p>
<p>was unemployment and hunger and these are apt to lead to</p>
<p>discontent and riots. Western Asia in older days had fed millions.</p>
<p>It was an excellent field for the purpose of immigration.</p>
<p>Therefore at the council of Clermont in France in the year</p>
<p>1095 the Pope arose, described the terrible horrors which the</p>
<p>infidels had inflicted upon the Holy Land, gave a glowing</p>
<p>description of this country which ever since the days of Moses</p>
<p>had been overflowing with milk and honey, and exhorted the</p>
<p>knights of France and the people of Europe in general to</p>
<p>leave wife and child and deliver Palestine from the Turks.</p>
<p>A wave of religious hysteria swept across the continent.</p>
<p>All reason stopped. Men would drop their hammer and saw,</p>
<p>walk out of their shop and take the nearest road to the east</p>
<p>to go and kill Turks. Children would leave their homes to ``go</p>
<p>to Palestine&#x27;&#x27; and bring the terrible Turks to their knees by</p>
<p>the mere appeal of their youthful zeal and Christian piety.</p>
<p>Fully ninety percent of those enthusiasts never got within</p>
<p>sight of the Holy Land. They had no money. They were</p>
<p>forced to beg or steal to keep alive. They became a danger</p>
<p>to the safety of the highroads and they were killed by the</p>
<p>angry country people.</p>
<p>The first Crusade, a wild mob of honest Christians, defaulting</p>
<p>bankrupts, penniless noblemen and fugitives from justice,</p>
<p>following the lead of half-crazy Peter the Hermit and Walter-</p>
<p>without-a-Cent, began their campaign against the Infidels by</p>
<p>murdering all the Jews whom they met by the way. They</p>
<p>got as far as Hungary and then they were all killed.</p>
<p>This experience taught the Church a lesson. Enthusiasm</p>
<p>alone would not set the Holy Land free. Organisation was</p>
<p>as necessary as good-will and courage. A year was spent in</p>
<p>training and equipping an army of 200,000 men. They were</p>
<p>placed under command of Godfrey of Bouillon, Robert, duke</p>
<p>of Normandy, Robert, count of Flanders, and a number of</p>
<p>other noblemen, all experienced in the art of war.</p>
<p>In the year 1096 this second crusade started upon its long</p>
<p>voyage. At Constantinople the knights did homage to the</p>
<p>Emperor. (For as I have told you, traditions die hard, and</p>
<p>a Roman Emperor, however poor and powerless, was still held</p>
<p>in great respect). Then they crossed into Asia, killed all the</p>
<p>Moslems who fell into their hands, stormed Jerusalem, massacred</p>
<p>the Mohammedan population, and marched to the Holy</p>
<p>Sepulchre to give praise and thanks amidst tears of piety and</p>
<p>gratitude. But soon the Turks were strengthened by the arrival</p>
<p>of fresh troops. Then they retook Jerusalem and in turn</p>
<p>killed the faithful followers of the Cross.</p>
<p>During the next two centuries, seven other crusades took</p>
<p>place. Gradually the Crusaders learned the technique of the</p>
<p>trip. The land voyage was too tedious and too dangerous.</p>
<p>They preferred to cross the Alps and go to Genoa or Venice</p>
<p>where they took ship for the east. The Genoese and the Venetians</p>
<p>made this trans-Mediterranean passenger service a very</p>
<p>profitable business. They charged exorbitant rates, and when</p>
<p>the Crusaders (most of whom had very little money) could not</p>
<p>pay the price, these Italian ``profiteers&#x27;&#x27; kindly allowed them</p>
<p>to ``work their way across.&#x27;&#x27; In return for a fare from Venice</p>
<p>to Acre, the Crusader undertook to do a stated amount of</p>
<p>fighting for the owners of his vessel. In this way Venice greatly</p>
<p>increased her territory along the coast of the Adriatic and in</p>
<p>Greece, where Athens became a Venetian colony, and in the</p>
<p>islands of Cyprus and Crete and Rhodes.</p>
<p>All this, however, helped little in settling the question</p>
<p>of the Holy Land. After the first enthusiasm had</p>
<p>worn off, a short crusading trip became part of the liberal</p>
<p>education of every well-bred young man, and there</p>
<p>never was any lack of candidates for service in Palestine.</p>
<p>But the old zeal was gone. The Crusaders, who</p>
<p>had begun their warfare with deep hatred for the</p>
<p>Mohammedans and great love for the Christian people</p>
<p>of the eastern Roman Empire and Armenia, suffered</p>
<p>a complete change of heart. They came to despise the</p>
<p>Greeks of Byzantium, who cheated them and frequently betrayed</p>
<p>the cause of the Cross, and the Armenians and all the</p>
<p>other Levantine races, and they began to appreciate the vir-</p>
<p>tues of their enemies who proved to be generous and fair</p>
<p>opponents.</p>
<p>Of course, it would never do to say this openly. But when</p>
<p>the Crusader returned home, he was likely to imitate the manners</p>
<p>which he had learned from his heathenish foe, compared</p>
<p>to whom the average western knight was still a good deal of a</p>
<p>country bumpkin. He also brought with him several new</p>
<p>food-stuffs, such as peaches and spinach which he planted in his</p>
<p>garden and grew for his own benefit. He gave up the barbarous</p>
<p>custom of wearing a load of heavy armour and appeared</p>
<p>in the flowing robes of silk or cotton which were the traditional</p>
<p>habit of the followers of the Prophet and were originally worn</p>
<p>by the Turks. Indeed the Crusades, which had begun as a</p>
<p>punitive expedition against the Heathen, became a course of</p>
<p>general instruction in civilisation for millions of young Europeans.</p>
<p>From a military and political point of view the Crusades</p>
<p>were a failure. Jerusalem and a number of cities were taken</p>
<p>and lost. A dozen little kingdoms were established in Syria</p>
<p>and Palestine and Asia Minor, but they were re-conquered by</p>
<p>the Turks and after the year 1244 (when Jerusalem became</p>
<p>definitely Turkish) the status of the Holy Land was the same</p>
<p>as it had been before 1095.</p>
<p>But Europe had undergone a great change. The people of</p>
<p>the west had been allowed a glimpse of the light and the sunshine</p>
<p>and the beauty of the east. Their dreary castles no</p>
<p>longer satisfied them. They wanted a broader life. Neither</p>
<p>Church nor State could give this to them.</p>
<p>They found it in the cities.</p>
<p>THE MEDIAEVAL CITY</p>
<p>WHY THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES</p>
<p>SAID THAT ``CITY AIR IS FREE AIR&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>THE early part of the Middle Ages had been an era of</p>
<p>pioneering and of settlement. A new people, who thus far</p>
<p>had lived outside the wild range of forest, mountains and</p>
<p>marshes which protected the north-eastern frontier of the Roman</p>
<p>Empire, had forced its way into the plains of western</p>
<p>Europe and had taken possession of most of the land. They</p>
<p>were restless, as all pioneers have been since the beginning of</p>
<p>time. They liked to be ``on the go.&#x27;&#x27; They cut down the</p>
<p>forests and they cut each other&#x27;s throats with equal energy.</p>
<p>Few of them wanted to live in cities. They insisted upon being</p>
<p>``free,&#x27;&#x27; they loved to feel the fresh air of the hillsides fill their</p>
<p>lungs while they drove their herds across the wind-swept pastures.</p>
<p>When they no longer liked their old homes, they pulled</p>
<p>up stakes and went away in search of fresh adventures.</p>
<p>The weaker ones died. The hardy fighters and the courageous</p>
<p>women who had followed their men into the wilderness</p>
<p>survived. In this way they developed a strong race of</p>
<p>men. They cared little for the graces of life. They were too</p>
<p>busy to play the fiddle or write pieces of poetry. They had</p>
<p>little love for discussions. The priest, ``the learned man&#x27;&#x27; of the</p>
<p>village (and before the middle of the thirteenth century, a layman</p>
<p>who could read and write was regarded as a ``sissy&#x27;&#x27;) was</p>
<p>supposed to settle all questions which had no direct practical</p>
<p>value. Meanwhile the German chieftain, the Frankish Baron,</p>
<p>the Northman Duke (or whatever their names and titles) occupied</p>
<p>their share of the territory which once had been part of</p>
<p>the great Roman Empire and among the ruins of past glory,</p>
<p>they built a world of their own which pleased them mightily</p>
<p>and which they considered quite perfect.</p>
<p>They managed the affairs of their castle and the surrounding</p>
<p>country to the best of their ability. They were as faithful</p>
<p>to the commandments of the Church as any weak mortal could</p>
<p>hope to be. They were sufficiently loyal to their king or emperor</p>
<p>to keep on good terms with those distant but always dangerous</p>
<p>potentates. In short, they tried to do right and to be</p>
<p>fair to their neighbours without being exactly unfair to their</p>
<p>own interests.</p>
<p>It was not an ideal world in which they found themselves.</p>
<p>The greater part of the people were serfs or ``villains,&#x27;&#x27; farm-</p>
<p>hands who were as much a part of the soil upon which they</p>
<p>lived as the cows and sheep whose stables they shared. Their</p>
<p>fate was not particularly happy nor was it particularly</p>
<p>unhappy. But what was one to do? The good Lord who ruled</p>
<p>the world of the Middle Ages had undoubtedly ordered everything</p>
<p>for the best. If He, in his wisdom, had decided that</p>
<p>there must be both knights and serfs, it was not the duty of</p>
<p>these faithful sons of the church to question the arrangement.</p>
<p>The serfs therefore did not complain but when they were too</p>
<p>hard driven, they would die off like cattle which are not fed</p>
<p>and stabled in the right way, and then something would be hastily</p>
<p>done to better their condition. But if the progress of the</p>
<p>world had been left to the serf and his feudal master, we would</p>
<p>still be living after the fashion of the twelfth century, saying</p>
<p>``abracadabra&#x27;&#x27; when we tried to stop a tooth-ache, and feeling</p>
<p>a deep contempt and hatred for the dentist who offered to help</p>
<p>us with his ``science,&#x27;&#x27; which most likely was of Mohammedan</p>
<p>or heathenish origin and therefore both wicked and useless.</p>
<p>When you grow up you will discover that many people do</p>
<p>not believe in ``progress&#x27;&#x27; and they will prove to you by the</p>
<p>terrible deeds of some of our own contemporaries that ``the</p>
<p>world does not change.&#x27;&#x27; But I hope that you will not pay</p>
<p>much attention to such talk. You see, it took our ancestors</p>
<p>almost a million years to learn how to walk on their hind legs.</p>
<p>Other centuries had to go by before their animal-like grunts</p>
<p>developed into an understandable language. Writing--the art</p>
<p>of preserving our ideas for the benefit of future generations,</p>
<p>without which no progress is possible was invented only four</p>
<p>thousand years ago. The idea of turning the forces of nature</p>
<p>into the obedient servants of man was quite new in the days of</p>
<p>your own grandfather. It seems to me, therefore, that we are</p>
<p>making progress at an unheard-of rate of speed. Perhaps we</p>
<p>have paid a little too much attention to the mere physical comforts</p>
<p>of life. That will change in due course of time and we</p>
<p>shall then attack the problems which are not related to health</p>
<p>and to wages and plumbing and machinery in general.</p>
<p>But please do not be too sentimental about the ``good old</p>
<p>days.&#x27;&#x27; Many people who only see the beautiful churches and</p>
<p>the great works of art which the Middle Ages have left behind</p>
<p>grow quite eloquent when they compare our own ugly civilisation</p>
<p>with its hurry and its noise and the evil smells of backfiring</p>
<p>motor trucks with the cities of a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>But these mediaeval churches were invariably surrounded by</p>
<p>miserable hovels compared to which a modern tenement house</p>
<p>stands forth as a luxurious palace. It is true that the noble</p>
<p>Lancelot and the equally noble Parsifal, the pure young hero</p>
<p>who went in search of the Holy Grail, were not bothered by</p>
<p>the odor of gasoline. But there were other smells of the barnyard</p>
<p>variety--odors of decaying refuse which had been thrown</p>
<p>into the street--of pig-sties surrounding the Bishop&#x27;s palace--</p>
<p>of unwashed people who had inherited their coats and hats</p>
<p>from their grandfathers and who had never learned the blessing</p>
<p>of soap. I do not want to paint too unpleasant a picture.</p>
<p>But when you read in the ancient chronicles that the King of</p>
<p>France, looking out of the windows of his palace, fainted at</p>
<p>the stench caused by the pigs rooting in the streets of Paris,</p>
<p>when an ancient manuscript recounts a few details of an epidemic</p>
<p>of the plague or of small-pox, then you begin to under-</p>
<p>stand that ``progress&#x27;&#x27; is something more than a catchword used</p>
<p>by modern advertising men.</p>
<p>No, the progress of the last six hundred years would not</p>
<p>have been possible without the existence of cities. I shall,</p>
<p>therefore, have to make this chapter a little longer than many</p>
<p>of the others. It is too important to be reduced to three or</p>
<p>four pages, devoted to mere political events.</p>
<p>The ancient world of Egypt and Babylonia and Assyria</p>
<p>had been a world of cities. Greece had been a country of City-</p>
<p>States. The history of Phoenicia was the history of two cities</p>
<p>called Sidon and Tyre. The Roman Empire was the ``hinterland&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>of a single town. Writing, art, science, astronomy, architecture,</p>
<p>literature, the theatre--the list is endless--have all</p>
<p>been products of the city.</p>
<p>For almost four thousand years the wooden bee-hive which</p>
<p>we call a town had been the workshop of the world. Then came</p>
<p>the great migrations. The Roman Empire was destroyed.</p>
<p>The cities were burned down and Europe once more became a</p>
<p>land of pastures and little agricultural villages. During the</p>
<p>Dark Ages the fields of civilisation had lain fallow.</p>
<p>The Crusades had prepared the soil for a new crop. It</p>
<p>was time for the harvest, but the fruit was plucked by the</p>
<p>burghers of the free cities.</p>
<p>I have told you the story of the castles and the monasteries,</p>
<p>with their heavy stone enclosures--the homes of the knights</p>
<p>and the monks, who guarded men&#x27;s bodies and their souls.</p>
<p>You have seen how a few artisans (butchers and bakers and an</p>
<p>occasional candle-stick maker) came to live near the castle</p>
<p>to tend to the wants of their masters and to find protection</p>
<p>in case of danger. Sometimes the feudal lord allowed these</p>
<p>people to surround their houses with a stockade. But they</p>
<p>were dependent for their living upon the good-will of the</p>
<p>mighty Seigneur of the castle. When he went about they knelt</p>
<p>before him and kissed his hand.</p>
<p>Then came the Crusades and many things changed. The</p>
<p>migrations had driven people from the north-east to the west.</p>
<p>The Crusades made millions of people travel from the west to</p>
<p>the highly civilised regions of the south-east. They discovered</p>
<p>that the world was not bounded by the four walls of their little</p>
<p>settlement. They came to appreciate better clothes, more</p>
<p>comfortable houses, new dishes, products of the mysterious Orient.</p>
<p>After their return to their old homes, they insisted that they</p>
<p>be supplied with those articles. The peddler with his pack</p>
<p>upon his back--the only merchant of the Dark Ages--added</p>
<p>these goods to his old merchandise, bought a cart, hired a few</p>
<p>ex-crusaders to protect him against the crime wave which</p>
<p>followed this great international war, and went forth to do</p>
<p>business upon a more modern and larger scale. His career was</p>
<p>not an easy one. Every time he entered the domains of another</p>
<p>Lord he had to pay tolls and taxes. But the business</p>
<p>was profitable all the same and the peddler continued to make</p>
<p>his rounds.</p>
<p>Soon certain energetic merchants discovered that the goods</p>
<p>which they had always imported from afar could be made at</p>
<p>home. They turned part of their homes into a workgshop.{sic}</p>
<p>They ceased to be merchants and became manufacturers. They</p>
<p>sold their products not only to the lord of the castle and to the</p>
<p>abbot in his monastery, but they exported them to nearby towns.</p>
<p>The lord and the abbot paid them with products of their farms,</p>
<p>eggs and wines, and with honey, which in those early days was</p>
<p>used as sugar. But the citizens of distant towns were obliged</p>
<p>to pay in cash and the manufacturer and the merchant began to</p>
<p>own little pieces of gold, which entirely changed their position</p>
<p>in the society of the early Middle Ages.</p>
<p>It is difficult for you to imagine a world without money.</p>
<p>In a modern city one cannot possible live without money. All</p>
<p>day long you carry a pocket full of small discs of metal to</p>
<p>``pay your way.&#x27;&#x27; You need a nickel for the street-car, a dollar</p>
<p>for a dinner, three cents for an evening paper. But many</p>
<p>people of the early Middle Ages never saw a piece of coined</p>
<p>money from the time they were born to the day of their death.</p>
<p>The gold and silver of Greece and Rome lay buried beneath</p>
<p>the ruins of their cities. The world of the migrations, which</p>
<p>had succeeded the Empire, was an agricultural world. Every</p>
<p>farmer raised enough grain and enough sheep and enough</p>
<p>cows for his own use.</p>
<p>The mediaeval knight was a country squire and was rarely</p>
<p>forced to pay for materials in money. His estates produced</p>
<p>everything that he and his family ate and drank and wore on</p>
<p>their backs. The bricks for his house were made along the</p>
<p>banks of the nearest river. Wood for the rafters of the hall</p>
<p>was cut from the baronial forest. The few articles that had to</p>
<p>come from abroad were paid for in goods--in honey--in eggs</p>
<p>--in fagots.</p>
<p>But the Crusades upset the routine of the old agricultural</p>
<p>life in a very drastic fashion. Suppose that the Duke of Hildesheim</p>
<p>was going to the Holy Land. He must travel thousands</p>
<p>of miles and he must pay his passage and his hotel-bills.</p>
<p>At home he could pay with products of his farm. But he</p>
<p>could not well take a hundred dozen eggs and a cart-load of</p>
<p>hams with him to satisfy the greed of the shipping agent of</p>
<p>Venice or the inn-keeper of the Brenner Pass. These gentlemen</p>
<p>insisted upon cash. His Lordship therefore was obliged</p>
<p>to take a small quantity of gold with him upon his voyage.</p>
<p>Where could he find this gold? He could borrow it from the</p>
<p>Lombards, the descendants of the old Longobards, who had</p>
<p>turned professional money-lenders, who seated behind their</p>
<p>exchange-table (commonly known as ``banco&#x27;&#x27; or bank) were</p>
<p>glad to let his Grace have a few hundred gold pieces in exchange</p>
<p>for a mortgage upon his estates, that they might be repaid</p>
<p>in case His Lordship should die at the hands of the Turks.</p>
<p>That was dangerous business for the borrower. In the end,</p>
<p>the Lombards invariably owned the estates and the Knight</p>
<p>became a bankrupt, who hired himself out as a fighting man to</p>
<p>a more powerful and more careful neighbour.</p>
<p>His Grace could also go to that part of the town where the</p>
<p>Jews were forced to live. There he could borrow money at a</p>
<p>rate of fifty or sixty percent. interest. That, too, was bad</p>
<p>business. But was there a way out? Some of the people of the</p>
<p>little city which surrounded the castle were said to have money.</p>
<p>They had known the young lord all his life. His father and</p>
<p>their fathers had been good friends. They would not be</p>
<p>unreasonable in their demands. Very well. His Lordship&#x27;s</p>
<p>clerk, a monk who could write and keep accounts, sent a note</p>
<p>to the best known merchants and asked for a small loan. The</p>
<p>townspeople met in the work-room of the jeweller who made</p>
<p>chalices for the nearby churches and discussed this demand.</p>
<p>They could not well refuse. It would serve no purpose to</p>
<p>ask for ``interest.&#x27;&#x27; In the first place, it was against the</p>
<p>religious principles of most people to take interest and in the</p>
<p>second place, it would never be paid except in agricultural</p>
<p>products and of these the people had enough and to spare.</p>
<p>``But,&#x27;&#x27; suggested the tailor who spent his days quietly sitting</p>
<p>upon his table and who was somewhat of a philosopher,</p>
<p>``suppose that we ask some favour in return for our money.</p>
<p>We are all fond of fishing. But his Lordship won&#x27;t let us</p>
<p>fish in his brook. Suppose that we let him have a hundred</p>
<p>ducats and that he give us in return a written guarantee allowing</p>
<p>us to fish all we want in all of his rivers. Then he gets</p>
<p>the hundred which he needs, but we get the fish and it will be</p>
<p>good business all around.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The day his Lordship accepted this proposition (it seemed</p>
<p>such an easy way of getting a hundred gold pieces) he signed</p>
<p>the death-warrant of his own power. His clerk drew up the</p>
<p>agreement. His Lordship made his mark (for he could not</p>
<p>sign his name) and departed for the East. Two years later</p>
<p>he came back, dead broke. The townspeople were fishing in</p>
<p>the castle pond. The sight of this silent row of anglers annoyed</p>
<p>his Lordship. He told his equerry to go and chase the crowd</p>
<p>away. They went, but that night a delegation of merchants</p>
<p>visited the castle. They were very polite. They congratulated</p>
<p>his Lordship upon his safe return. They were sorry his</p>
<p>Lordship had been annoyed by the fishermen, but as his Lordship</p>
<p>might perhaps remember he had given them permission</p>
<p>to do so himself, and the tailor produced the Charter which</p>
<p>had been kept in the safe of the jeweller ever since the master</p>
<p>had gone to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>His Lordship was much annoyed. But once more he was</p>
<p>in dire need of some money. In Italy he had signed his name</p>
<p>to certain documents which were now in the possession of Salvestro</p>
<p>dei Medici, the well-known banker. These documents</p>
<p>were ``promissory notes&#x27;&#x27; and they were due two months from</p>
<p>date. Their total amount came to three hundred and forty</p>
<p>pounds, Flemish gold. Under these circumstances, the noble</p>
<p>knight could not well show the rage which filled his heart and</p>
<p>his proud soul. Instead, he suggested another little loan. The</p>
<p>merchants retired to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>After three days they came back and said ``yes.&#x27;&#x27; They</p>
<p>were only too happy to be able to help their master in his</p>
<p>difficulties, but in return for the 345 golden pounds would he give</p>
<p>them another written promise (another charter) that they,</p>
<p>the townspeople, might establish a council of their own to be</p>
<p>elected by all the merchants and free citizens of the city, said</p>
<p>council to manage civic affairs without interference from the</p>
<p>side of the castle?</p>
<p>His Lordship was confoundedly angry. But again,</p>
<p>he needed the money. He said yes, and signed the charter.</p>
<p>Next week, he repented. He called his soldiers and went to</p>
<p>the house of the jeweller and asked for the documents which</p>
<p>his crafty subjects had cajoled out of him under the pressure</p>
<p>of circumstances. He took them away and burned them.</p>
<p>The townspeople stood by and said nothing. But when next</p>
<p>his Lordship needed money to pay for the dowry of his daughter.</p>
<p>he was unable to get a single penny. After that little</p>
<p>affair at the jeweller&#x27;s his credit was not considered good.</p>
<p>He was forced to eat humble-pie and offer to make certain reparations.</p>
<p>Before his Lordship got the first installment of the stipulated sum,</p>
<p>the townspeople were once more in possession of all their old charters</p>
<p>and a brand new one which permitted them to build a ``city-hall&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>and a strong tower where all the charters might be kept protected</p>
<p>against fire and theft, which really meant protected against</p>
<p>future violence on the part of the Lord and his armed followers.</p>
<p>This, in a very general way, is what happened during the</p>
<p>centuries which followed the Crusades. It was a slow process,</p>
<p>this gradual shifting of power from the castle to the city. There</p>
<p>was some fighting. A few tailors and jewellers were killed and</p>
<p>a few castles went up in smoke. But such occurrences were</p>
<p>not common. Almost imperceptibly the towns grew richer</p>
<p>and the feudal lords grew poorer. To maintain themselves</p>
<p>they were for ever forced to exchange charters of civic liberty</p>
<p>in return for ready cash. The cities grew. They offered an</p>
<p>asylum to run-away serfs who gained their liberty after they</p>
<p>had lived a number of years behind the city walls. They came</p>
<p>to be the home of the more energetic elements of the</p>
<p>surrounding country districts. They were proud of</p>
<p>their new importance and expressed their power in the</p>
<p>churches and public buildings which they erected</p>
<p>around the old market place, where centuries before</p>
<p>the barter of eggs and sheep and honey and salt</p>
<p>had taken place. They wanted their children to</p>
<p>have a better chance in life than they had enjoyed</p>
<p>themselves. They hired monks to come to their city and</p>
<p>be school teachers. When they heard of a man who could</p>
<p>paint pictures upon boards of wood, they offered him a pension</p>
<p>if he would come and cover the walls of their chapels and their</p>
<p>town hall with scenes from the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile his Lordship, in the dreary and drafty halls of</p>
<p>his castle, saw all this up-start splendour and regretted the</p>
<p>day when first he had signed away a single one of his sovereign</p>
<p>rights and prerogatives. But he was helpless. The townspeople</p>
<p>with their well-filled strong-boxes snapped their fingers</p>
<p>at him. They were free men, fully prepared to hold what they</p>
<p>had gained by the sweat of their brow and after a struggle</p>
<p>which had lasted for more than ten generations.</p>
<p>MEDIAEVAL SELF-GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>HOW THE PEOPLE OF THE CITIES ASSERTED</p>
<p>THEIR RIGHT TO BE HEARD IN THE</p>
<p>ROYAL COUNCILS OF THEIR COUNTRY</p>
<p>As long as people were ``nomads,&#x27;&#x27; wandering tribes of shepherds,</p>
<p>all men had been equal and had been responsible for the</p>
<p>welfare and safety of the entire community.</p>
<p>But after they had settled down and some had become rich</p>
<p>and others had grown poor, the government was apt to fall into</p>
<p>the hands of those who were not obliged to work for their living</p>
<p>and who could devote themselves to politics.</p>
<p>I have told you how this had happened in Egypt and in</p>
<p>Mesopotamia and in Greece and in Rome. It occurred among</p>
<p>the Germanic population of western Europe as soon as order</p>
<p>had been restored. The western European world was ruled</p>
<p>in the first place by an emperor who was elected by the seven</p>
<p>or eight most important kings of the vast Roman Empire of</p>
<p>the German nation and who enjoyed a great deal of imaginary</p>
<p>and very little actual power. It was ruled by a number of</p>
<p>kings who sat upon shaky thrones. The every-day government</p>
<p>was in the hands of thousands of feudal princelets. Their</p>
<p>subjects were peasants or serfs. There were few cities. There</p>
<p>was hardly any middle class. But during the thirteenth century</p>
<p>(after an absence of almost a thousand years) the middle</p>
<p>class--the merchant class--once more appeared upon the his-</p>
<p>torical stage and its rise in power, as we saw in the last chapter,</p>
<p>had meant a decrease in the influence of the castle folk.</p>
<p>Thus far, the king, in ruling his domains, had only paid</p>
<p>attention to the wishes of his noblemen and his bishops. But the</p>
<p>new world of trade and commerce which grew out of the</p>
<p>Crusades forced him to recognise the middle class or suffer</p>
<p>from an ever-increasing emptiness of his exchequer. Their</p>
<p>majesties (if they had followed their hidden wishes) would</p>
<p>have as lief consulted their cows and their pigs as the good</p>
<p>burghers of their cities. But they could not help themselves.</p>
<p>They swallowed the bitter pill because it was gilded, but not</p>
<p>without a struggle.</p>
<p>In England, during the absence of Richard the Lion</p>
<p>Hearted (who had gone to the Holy Land, but who was spending</p>
<p>the greater part of his crusading voyage in an Austrian</p>
<p>jail) the government of the country had been placed in the</p>
<p>hands of John, a brother of Richard, who was his inferior in</p>
<p>the art of war, but his equal as a bad administrator. John had</p>
<p>begun his career as a regent by losing Normandy and the</p>
<p>greater part of the French possessions. Next, he had managed</p>
<p>to get into a quarrel with Pope Innocent III, the famous</p>
<p>enemy of the Hohenstaufens. The Pope had excommunicated</p>
<p>John (as Gregory VII had excommunicated the Emperor</p>
<p>Henry IV two centuries before). In the year 1213 John had</p>
<p>been obliged to make an ignominious peace just as Henry IV</p>
<p>had been obliged to do in the year 1077.</p>
<p>Undismayed by his lack of success, John continued to abuse</p>
<p>his royal power until his disgruntled vassals made a prisoner</p>
<p>of their anointed ruler and forced him to promise that he</p>
<p>would be good and would never again interfere with the ancient</p>
<p>rights of his subjects. All this happened on a little island in</p>
<p>the Thames, near the village of Runnymede, on the 15th of</p>
<p>June of the year 1215. The document to which John signed</p>
<p>his name was called the Big Charter--the Magna Carta. It</p>
<p>contained very little that was new. It re-stated in short and</p>
<p>direct sentences the ancient duties of the king and enumerated</p>
<p>the privileges of his vassals. It paid little attention to the</p>
<p>rights (if any) of the vast majority of the people, the peasants,</p>
<p>but it offered certain securities to the rising class of the</p>
<p>merchants. It was a charter of great importance because it defined</p>
<p>the powers of the king with more precision than had ever been</p>
<p>done before. But it was still a purely mediaeval document. It</p>
<p>did not refer to common human beings, unless they happened to</p>
<p>be the property of the vassal, which must be safe-guarded</p>
<p>against royal tyranny just as the Baronial woods and cows</p>
<p>were protected against an excess of zeal on the part of the</p>
<p>royal foresters.</p>
<p>A few years later, however, we begin to hear a very different</p>
<p>note in the councils of His Majesty.</p>
<p>John, who was bad, both by birth and inclination, solemnly</p>
<p>had promised to obey the great charter and then had broken</p>
<p>every one of its many stipulations. Fortunately, he soon died</p>
<p>and was succeeded by his son Henry III, who was forced to</p>
<p>recognise the charter anew. Meanwhile, Uncle Richard, the</p>
<p>Crusader, had cost the country a great deal of money and the</p>
<p>king was obliged to ask for a few loans that he might pay his</p>
<p>obligations to the Jewish money-lenders. The large land-owners</p>
<p>and the bishops who acted as councillors to the king could</p>
<p>not provide him with the necessary gold and silver. The king</p>
<p>then gave orders that a few representatives of the cities be</p>
<p>called upon to attend the sessions of his Great Council. They</p>
<p>made their first appearance in the year 1265. They were supposed</p>
<p>to act only as financial experts who were not supposed</p>
<p>to take a part in the general discussion of matters of state, but</p>
<p>to give advice exclusively upon the question of taxation.</p>
<p>Gradually, however, these representatives of the ``commons&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>were consulted upon many of the problems and the meeting</p>
<p>of noblemen, bishops and city delegates developed into a regular</p>
<p>Parliament, a place ``ou l&#x27;on parfait,&#x27;&#x27; which means in English</p>
<p>where people talked, before important affairs of state were</p>
<p>decided upon.</p>
<p>But the institution of such a general advisory-board with</p>
<p>certain executive powers was not an English invention, as</p>
<p>seems to ke the general belief, and government by a ``king and</p>
<p>his parliament&#x27;&#x27; was by no means restricted to the British Isles.</p>
<p>You will find it in every part of Europe. In some countries,</p>
<p>like France, the rapid increase of the Royal power after the</p>
<p>Middle Ages reduced the influence of the ``parliament&#x27;&#x27; to nothing.</p>
<p>In the year 1302 representatives of the cities had been</p>
<p>admitted to the meeting of the French Parliament, but five</p>
<p>centuries had to pass before this ``Parliament&#x27;&#x27; was strong</p>
<p>enough to assert the rights of the middle class, the so-called</p>
<p>Third Estate, and break the power of the king. Then they</p>
<p>made up for lost time and during the French Revolution, abolished</p>
<p>the king, the clergy and the nobles and made the representatives</p>
<p>of the common people the rulers of the land. In</p>
<p>Spain the ``cortex&#x27;&#x27; (the king&#x27;s council) had been opened to the</p>
<p>commoners as early as the first half of the twelfth century.</p>
<p>In the Germain Empire, a number of important cities had obtained</p>
<p>the rank of ``imperial cities&#x27;&#x27; whose representatives must</p>
<p>be heard in the imperial diet.</p>
<p>In Sweden, representatives of the people attended the sessions</p>
<p>of the Riksdag at the first meeting of the year 1359. In</p>
<p>Denmark the Daneholf, the ancient national assembly, was re-</p>
<p>established in 1314, and, although the nobles often regained control</p>
<p>of the country at the expense of the king and the people,</p>
<p>the representatives of the cities were never completely deprived</p>
<p>of their power.</p>
<p>In the Scandinavian country, the story of representative</p>
<p>government is particularly interesting. In Iceland, the ``Althing,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>the assembly of all free landowners, who managed the</p>
<p>affairs of the island, began to hold regular meetings in the ninth</p>
<p>century and continued to do so for more than a thousand</p>
<p>years.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, the freemen of the different cantons defended</p>
<p>their assemblies against the attempts of a number of</p>
<p>feudal neighbours with great success.</p>
<p>Finally, in the Low Countries, in Holland, the councils of</p>
<p>the different duchies and counties were attended by representatives</p>
<p>of the third estate as early as the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century a number of these small provinces</p>
<p>rebelled against their king, abjured his majesty in a solemn</p>
<p>meeting of the ``Estates General,&#x27;&#x27; removed the clergy from</p>
<p>the discussions, broke the power of the nobles and assumed full</p>
<p>executive authority over the newly-established Republic of the</p>
<p>United Seven Netherlands. For two centuries, the representatives</p>
<p>of the town-councils ruled the country without a king,</p>
<p>without bishops and without noblemen. The city had become</p>
<p>supreme and the good burghers had become the rulers of the</p>
<p>land.</p>
<p>THE MEDIAEVAL WORLD</p>
<p>WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE MIDDLE AGES</p>
<p>THOUGHT OF THE WORLD IN WHICH</p>
<p>THEY HAPPENED TO LIVE</p>
<p>DATES are a very useful invention. We could not do without</p>
<p>them but unless we are very careful, they will play tricks</p>
<p>with us. They are apt to make history too precise. For example,</p>
<p>when I talk of the point-of-view of mediaeval man, I</p>
<p>do not mean that on the 31st of December of the year 476,</p>
<p>suddenly all the people of Europe said, ``Ah, now the Roman</p>
<p>Empire has come to an end and we are living in the Middle</p>
<p>Ages. How interesting!&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>You could have found men at the Frankish court of Charlemagne</p>
<p>who were Romans in their habits, in their manners, in</p>
<p>their out-look upon life. On the other hand, when you grow</p>
<p>up you will discover that some of the people in this world have</p>
<p>never passed beyond the stage of the cave-man. All times</p>
<p>and all ages overlap, and the ideas of succeeding generations</p>
<p>play tag with each other. But it is possible to study the minds</p>
<p>of a good many true representatives of the Middle Ages and</p>
<p>then give you an idea of the average man&#x27;s attitude toward</p>
<p>life and the many difficult problems of living.</p>
<p>First of all, remember that the people of the Middle Ages</p>
<p>never thought of themselves as free-born citizens, who could</p>
<p>come and go at will and shape their fate according to their</p>
<p>ability or energy or luck. On the contrary, they all considered</p>
<p>themselves part of the general scheme of things, which included</p>
<p>emperors and serfs, popes and heretics, heroes and swashbucklers,</p>
<p>rich men, poor men, beggar men and thieves. They accepted</p>
<p>this divine ordinance and asked no questions. In this,</p>
<p>of course, they differed radically from modern people who accept</p>
<p>nothing and who are forever trying to improve their own</p>
<p>financial and political situation.</p>
<p>To the man and woman of the thirteenth century, the world</p>
<p>hereafter--a Heaven of wonderful delights and a Hell of brimstone</p>
<p>and suffering--meant something more than empty words</p>
<p>or vague theological phrases. It was an actual fact and the</p>
<p>mediaeval burghers and knights spent the greater part of their</p>
<p>time preparing for it. We modern people regard a noble</p>
<p>death after a well-spent life with the quiet calm of the ancient</p>
<p>Greeks and Romans. After three score years of work and effort,</p>
<p>we go to sleep with the feeling that all will be well.</p>
<p>But during the Middle Ages, the King of Terrors with</p>
<p>his grinning skull and his rattling bones was man&#x27;s steady</p>
<p>companion. He woke his victims up with terrible tunes on his</p>
<p>scratchy fiddle he sat down with them at dinner--he smiled</p>
<p>at them from behind trees and shrubs when they took a girl</p>
<p>out for a walk. If you had heard nothing but hair-raising</p>
<p>yarns about cemeteries and coffins and fearful diseases when</p>
<p>you were very young, instead of listening to the fairy stories</p>
<p>of Anderson and Grimm, you, too, would have lived all your</p>
<p>days in a dread of the final hour and the gruesome day of</p>
<p>Judgment. That is exactly what happened to the children of</p>
<p>the Middle Ages. They moved in a world of devils and spooks</p>
<p>and only a few occasional angels. Sometimes, their fear of</p>
<p>the future filled their souls with humility and piety, but often</p>
<p>it influenced them the other way and made them cruel and</p>
<p>sentimental. They would first of all murder all the women</p>
<p>and children of a captured city and then they would devoutly</p>
<p>march to a holy spot and with their hands gory with the blood</p>
<p>of innocent victims, they would pray that a merciful heaven forgive</p>
<p>them their sins. Yea, they would do more than pray, they</p>
<p>would weep bitter tears and would confess themselves the most</p>
<p>wicked of sinners. But the next day, they would once more</p>
<p>butcher a camp of Saracen enemies without a spark of mercy</p>
<p>in their hearts.</p>
<p>Of course, the Crusaders were Knights and obeyed a somewhat</p>
<p>different code of manners from the common men. But in</p>
<p>such respects the common man was just the same as his master.</p>
<p>He, too, resembled a shy horse, easily frightened by a</p>
<p>shadow or a silly piece of paper, capable of excellent and faithful</p>
<p>service but liable to run away and do terrible damage when</p>
<p>his feverish imagination saw a ghost.</p>
<p>In judging these good people, however, it is wise to remember</p>
<p>the terrible disadvantages under which they lived.</p>
<p>They were really barbarians who posed as civilised people.</p>
<p>Charlemagne and Otto the Great were called ``Roman Emperors,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>but they had as little resemblance to a real Roman Emperor</p>
<p>(say Augustus or Marcus Aurelius) as ``King&#x27;&#x27; Wumba</p>
<p>Wumba of the upper Congo has to the highly educated rulers</p>
<p>of Sweden or Denmark. They were savages who lived amidst</p>
<p>glorious ruins but who did not share the benefits of the</p>
<p>civilisation which their fathers and grandfathers had destroyed.</p>
<p>They knew nothing. They were ignorant of almost every fact</p>
<p>which a boy of twelve knows to-day. They were obliged to go</p>
<p>to one single book for all their information. That was the</p>
<p>Bible. But those parts of the Bible which have influenced the</p>
<p>history of the human race for the better are those chapters of</p>
<p>the New Testament which teach us the great moral lessons of</p>
<p>love, charity and forgiveness. As a handbook of astronomy,</p>
<p>zoology, botany, geometry and all the other sciences, the venerable</p>
<p>book is not entirely reliable. In the twelfth century, a</p>
<p>second book was added to the mediaeval library, the great</p>
<p>encyclopaedia of useful knowledge, compiled by Aristotle, the</p>
<p>Greek philosopher of the fourth century before Christ. Why</p>
<p>the Christian church should have been willing to accord such</p>
<p>high honors to the teacher of Alexander the Great, whereas</p>
<p>they condemned all other Greek philosophers on account of</p>
<p>their heathenish doctrines, I really do not know. But next to</p>
<p>the Bible, Aristotle was recognized as the only reliable teacher</p>
<p>whose works could be safely placed into the hands of true</p>
<p>Christians.</p>
<p>His works had reached Europe in a somewhat roundabout</p>
<p>way. They had gone from Greece to Alexandria. They had</p>
<p>then been translated from the Greek into the Arabic language</p>
<p>by the Mohammedans who conquered Egypt in the seventh</p>
<p>century. They had followed the Moslem armies into Spain and</p>
<p>the philosophy of the great Stagirite (Aristotle was a native of</p>
<p>Stagira in Macedonia) was taught in the Moorish universities</p>
<p>of Cordova. The Arabic text was then translated into Latin</p>
<p>by the Christian students who had crossed the Pyrenees to get</p>
<p>a liberal education and this much travelled version of the famous</p>
<p>books was at last taught at the different schools of northwestern</p>
<p>Europe. It was not very clear, but that made it all</p>
<p>the more interesting.</p>
<p>With the help of the Bible and Aristotle, the most brilliant</p>
<p>men of the Middle Ages now set to work to explain all things</p>
<p>between Heaven and Earth in their relation to the expressed</p>
<p>will of God. These brilliant men, the so-called Scholasts or</p>
<p>Schoolmen, were really very intelligent, but they had obtained</p>
<p>their information exclusively from books, and never from actual</p>
<p>observation. If they wanted to lecture on the sturgeon</p>
<p>or on caterpillars, they read the Old and New Testaments and</p>
<p>Aristotle, and told their students everything these good books</p>
<p>had to say upon the subject of caterpillars and sturgeons.</p>
<p>They did not go out to the nearest river to catch a sturgeon.</p>
<p>They did not leave their libraries and repair to the backyard</p>
<p>to catch a few caterpillars and look at these animals and study</p>
<p>them in their native haunts. Even such famous scholars as</p>
<p>Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas did not inquire whether</p>
<p>the sturgeons in the land of Palestine and the caterpillars of</p>
<p>Macedonia might not have been different from the sturgeons</p>
<p>and the caterpillars of western Europe.</p>
<p>When occasionally an exceptionally curious person like</p>
<p>Roger Bacon appeared in the council of the learned and began</p>
<p>to experiment with magnifying glasses and funny little telescopes</p>
<p>and actually dragged the sturgen and the caterpillar</p>
<p>into the lecturing room and proved that they were different</p>
<p>from the creatures described by the Old Testament and by</p>
<p>Aristotle, the Schoolmen shook their dignified heads. Bacon</p>
<p>was going too far. When he dared to suggest that an hour</p>
<p>of actual observation was worth more than ten years with</p>
<p>Aristotle and that the works of that famous Greek might as</p>
<p>well have remained untranslated for all the good they had ever</p>
<p>done, the scholasts went to the police and said, ``This man is</p>
<p>a danger to the safety of the state. He wants us to study</p>
<p>Greek that we may read Aristotle in the original. Why should</p>
<p>he not be contented with our Latin-Arabic translation which</p>
<p>has satisfied our faithful people for so many hundred years?</p>
<p>Why is he so curious about the insides of fishes and the insides</p>
<p>of insects? He is probably a wicked magician trying to upset</p>
<p>the established order of things by his Black Magic.&#x27;&#x27; And so</p>
<p>well did they plead their cause that the frightened guardians</p>
<p>of the peace forbade Bacon to write a single word for more</p>
<p>than ten years. When he resumed his studies he had learned</p>
<p>a lesson. He wrote his books in a queer cipher which made it</p>
<p>impossible for his contemporaries to read them, a trick which</p>
<p>became common as the Church became more desperate in its</p>
<p>attempts to prevent people from asking questions which would</p>
<p>lead to doubts and infidelity.</p>
<p>This, however, was not done out of any wicked desire to</p>
<p>keep people ignorant. The feeling which prompted the heretic</p>
<p>hunters of that day was really a very kindly one. They firmly</p>
<p>believed--nay, they knew--that this life was but the preparation</p>
<p>for our real existence in the next world. They felt convinced</p>
<p>that too much knowledge made people uncomfortable,</p>
<p>filled their minds with dangerous opinions and led to doubt</p>
<p>and hence to perdition. A mediaeval Schoolman who saw one</p>
<p>of his pupils stray away from the revealed authority of the</p>
<p>Bible and Aristotle, that he might study things for himself, felt</p>
<p>as uncomfortable as a loving mother who sees her young child</p>
<p>approach a hot stove. She knows that he will burn his little</p>
<p>fingers if he is allowed to touch it and she tries to keep him</p>
<p>back, if necessary she will use force. But she really loves</p>
<p>the child and if he will only obey her, she will be as good to him</p>
<p>as she possibly can be. In the same way the mediaeval guardians</p>
<p>of people&#x27;s souls, while they were strict in all matters</p>
<p>pertaining to the Faith, slaved day and night to render the</p>
<p>greatest possible service to the members of their flock. They</p>
<p>held out a helping hand whenever they could and the society</p>
<p>of that day shows the influence of thousands of good men and</p>
<p>pious women who tried to make the fate of the average mortal</p>
<p>as bearable as possible.</p>
<p>A serf was a serf and his position would never change. But</p>
<p>the Good Lord of the Middle Ages who allowed the serf to</p>
<p>remain a slave all his life had bestowed an immortal soul upon</p>
<p>this humble creature and therefore he must be protected in his</p>
<p>rights, that he might live and die as a good Christian. When</p>
<p>he grew too old or too weak to work he must be taken care</p>
<p>of by the feudal master for whom he had worked. The serf,</p>
<p>therefore, who led a monotonous and dreary life, was never</p>
<p>haunted by fear of to-morrow. He knew that he was ``safe&#x27;&#x27;--</p>
<p>that he could not be thrown out of employment, that he would</p>
<p>always have a roof over his head (a leaky roof, perhaps, but</p>
<p>roof all the same), and that he would always have something</p>
<p>to eat.</p>
<p>This feeling of <code>stability&#x27;&#x27; and of </code>safety&#x27;&#x27; was found in all</p>
<p>classes of society. In the towns the merchants and the artisans</p>
<p>established guilds which assured every member of a steady income.</p>
<p>It did not encourage the ambitious to do better than</p>
<p>their neighbours. Too often the guilds gave protection to</p>
<p>the <code>slacker&#x27;&#x27; who managed to </code>get by.&#x27;&#x27; But they established</p>
<p>a general feeling of content and assurance among the</p>
<p>labouring classes which no longer exists in our day of general</p>
<p>competition. The Middle Ages were familiar with the dangers</p>
<p>of what we modern people call ``corners,&#x27;&#x27; when a single rich</p>
<p>man gets hold of all the available grain or soap or pickled</p>
<p>herring, and then forces the world to buy from him at his own</p>
<p>price. The authorities, therefore, discouraged wholesale trading</p>
<p>and regulated the price at which merchants were allowed</p>
<p>to sell their goods.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages disliked competition. Why compete and</p>
<p>fill the world with hurry and rivalry and a multitude of pushing</p>
<p>men, when the Day of Judgement was near at hand, when</p>
<p>riches would count for nothing and when the good serf would</p>
<p>enter the golden gates of Heaven while the bad knight was</p>
<p>sent to do penance in the deepest pit of Inferno?</p>
<p>In short, the people of the Middle Ages were asked to surrender</p>
<p>part of their liberty of thought and action, that they</p>
<p>might enjoy greater safety from poverty of the body and poverty</p>
<p>of the soul.</p>
<p>And with a very few exceptions, they did not object. They</p>
<p>firmly believed that they were mere visitors upon this planet--</p>
<p>that they were here to be prepared for a greater and more</p>
<p>important life. Deliberately they turned their backs upon a</p>
<p>world which was filled with suffering and wickedness and</p>
<p>injustice. They pulled down the blinds that the rays of the</p>
<p>sun might not distract their attention from that chapter in the</p>
<p>Apocalypse which told them of that heavenly light which was</p>
<p>to illumine their happiness in all eternity. They tried to close</p>
<p>their eyes to most of the joys of the world in which they lived</p>
<p>that they might enjoy those which awaited them in the near</p>
<p>future. They accepted life as a necessary evil and welcomed</p>
<p>death as the beginning of a glorious day.</p>
<p>The Greeks and the Romans had never bothered about the</p>
<p>future but had tried to establish their Paradise right here upon</p>
<p>this earth. They had succeeded in making life extremely pleasant</p>
<p>for those of their fellow men who did not happen to be</p>
<p>slaves. Then came the other extreme of the Middle Ages,</p>
<p>when man built himself a Paradise beyond the highest clouds</p>
<p>and turned this world into a vale of tears for high and low,</p>
<p>for rich and poor, for the intelligent and the dumb. It was</p>
<p>time for the pendulum to swing back in the other direction, as</p>
<p>I shall tell you in my next chapter.</p>
<p>MEDIAEVAL TRADE</p>
<p>HOW THE CRUSADES ONCE MORE MADE THE</p>
<p>MEDITERRANEAN A BUSY CENTRE OF</p>
<p>TRADE AND HOW THE CITIES OF THE</p>
<p>ITALIAN PENINSULA BECAME THE GREAT</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTING CENTRE FOR THE COMMERCE</p>
<p>WITH ASIA AND AFRICA</p>
<p>THERE were three good reasons why the Italian cities should</p>
<p>have been the first to regain a position of great importance</p>
<p>during the late Middle Ages. The Italian peninsula had been</p>
<p>settled by Rome at a very early date. There had been more</p>
<p>roads and more towns and more schools than anywhere else</p>
<p>in Europe.</p>
<p>The barbarians had burned as lustily in Italy as elsewhere,</p>
<p>but there had been so much to destroy that more had been able</p>
<p>to survive. In the second place, the Pope lived in Italy and</p>
<p>as the head of a vast political machine, which owned land and</p>
<p>serfs and buildings and forests and rivers and conducted courts</p>
<p>of law, he was in constant receipt of a great deal of money.</p>
<p>The Papal authorities had to be paid in gold and silver as did</p>
<p>the merchants and ship-owners of Venice and Genoa. The</p>
<p>cows and the eggs and the horses and all the other agricultural</p>
<p>products of the north and the west must be changed into actual</p>
<p>cash before the debt could be paid in the distant city of Rome.</p>
<p>This made Italy the one country where there was a comparative</p>
<p>abundance of gold and silver. Finally, during the Crusades,</p>
<p>the Italian cities had become the point of embarkation</p>
<p>for the Crusaders and had profiteered to an almost unbelievable</p>
<p>extent.</p>
<p>And after the Crusades had come to an end, these same</p>
<p>Italian cities remained the distributing centres for those Oriental</p>
<p>goods upon which the people of Europe had come to depend</p>
<p>during the time they had spent in the near east.</p>
<p>Of these towns, few were as famous as Venice. Venice was</p>
<p>a republic built upon a mud bank. Thither people from the</p>
<p>mainland had fled during the invasions of the barbarians in the</p>
<p>fourth century. Surrounded on all sides by the sea they had</p>
<p>engaged in the business of salt-making. Salt had been very</p>
<p>scarce during the Middle Ages, and the price had been high.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years Venice had enjoyed a monopoly of</p>
<p>this indispensable table commodity (I say indispensable, because</p>
<p>people, like sheep, fall ill unless they get a certain amount</p>
<p>of salt in their food). The people had used this monopoly to</p>
<p>increase the power of their city. At times they had even dared</p>
<p>to defy the power of the Popes. The town had grown rich and</p>
<p>had begun to build ships, which engaged in trade with the</p>
<p>Orient. During the Crusades, these ships were used to carry</p>
<p>passengers to the Holy Land, and when the passengers could</p>
<p>not pay for their tickets in cash, they were obliged to help the</p>
<p>Venetians who were for ever increasing their colonies in the</p>
<p>AEgean Sea, in Asia Minor and in Egypt.</p>
<p>By the end of the fourteenth century, the population had</p>
<p>grown to two hundred thousand, which made Venice the biggest</p>
<p>city of the Middle Ages. The people were without influence</p>
<p>upon the government which was the private affair of a</p>
<p>small number of rich merchant families. They elected a senate</p>
<p>and a Doge (or Duke), but the actual rulers of the city were</p>
<p>the members of the famous Council of Ten,--who maintained</p>
<p>themselves with the help of a highly organised system of secret</p>
<p>service men and professional murderers, who kept watch upon</p>
<p>all citizens and quietly removed those who might be dangerous</p>
<p>to the safety of their high-handed and unscrupulous Committee</p>
<p>of Public Safety.</p>
<p>The other extreme of government, a democracy of very</p>
<p>turbulent habits, was to be found in Florence. This city</p>
<p>controlled the main road from northern Europe to Rome and used</p>
<p>the money which it had derived from this fortunate economic</p>
<p>position to engage in manufacturing. The Florentines tried to</p>
<p>follow the example of Athens. Noblemen, priests and members</p>
<p>of the guilds all took part in the discussions of civic affairs.</p>
<p>This led to great civic upheaval. People were forever being divided</p>
<p>into political parties and these parties fought each other</p>
<p>with intense bitterness and exiled their enemies and confiscated</p>
<p>their possessions as soon as they had gained a victory in the</p>
<p>council. After several centuries of this rule by organised mobs,</p>
<p>the inevitable happened. A powerful family made itself master</p>
<p>of the city and governed the town and the surrounding country</p>
<p>after the fashion of the old Greek ``tyrants.&#x27;&#x27; They were called</p>
<p>the Medici. The earliest Medici had been physicians (medicus</p>
<p>is Latin for physician, hence their name), but later they had</p>
<p>turned banker. Their banks and their pawnshops were to be</p>
<p>found in all the more important centres of trade. Even today</p>
<p>our American pawn-shops display the three golden balls</p>
<p>which were part of the coat of arms of the mighty house of</p>
<p>the Medici, who became rulers of Florence and married their</p>
<p>daughters to the kings of France and were buried in graves</p>
<p>worthy of a Roman Caesar.</p>
<p>Then there was Genoa, the great rival of Venice, where</p>
<p>the merchants specialised in trade with Tunis in Africa and</p>
<p>the grain depots of the Black Sea. Then there were more than</p>
<p>two hundred other cities, some large and some small, each a perfect</p>
<p>commercial unit, all of them fighting their neighbours and</p>
<p>rivals with the undying hatred of neighbours who are depriving</p>
<p>each other of their profits.</p>
<p>Once the products of the Orient and Africa had been</p>
<p>brought to these distributing centres, they must be prepared</p>
<p>for the voyage to the west and the north.</p>
<p>Genoa carried her goods by water to Marseilles, from where</p>
<p>they were reshipped to the cities along the Rhone, which in</p>
<p>turn served as the market places of northern and western</p>
<p>France.</p>
<p>Venice used the land route to northern Europe. This ancient</p>
<p>road led across the Brenner pass, the old gateway for</p>
<p>the barbarians who had invaded Italy. Past Innsbruck, the</p>
<p>merchandise was carried to Basel. From there it drifted down</p>
<p>the Rhine to the North Sea and England, or it was taken to</p>
<p>Augsburg where the Fugger family (who were both bankers</p>
<p>and manufacturers and who prospered greatly by ``shaving&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>the coins with which they paid their workmen), looked after</p>
<p>the further distribution to Nuremberg and Leipzig and the</p>
<p>cities of the Baltic and to Wisby (on the Island of Gotland)</p>
<p>which looked after the needs of the Northern Baltic and dealt</p>
<p>directly with the Republic of Novgorod, the old commercial</p>
<p>centre of Russia which was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible in</p>
<p>the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The little cities on the coast of north-western Europe had</p>
<p>an interesting story of their own. The mediaeval world ate a</p>
<p>great deal of fish. There were many fast days and then people</p>
<p>were not permitted to eat meat. For those who lived away</p>
<p>from the coast and from the rivers, this meant a diet of eggs</p>
<p>or nothing at all. But early in the thirteenth century a Dutch</p>
<p>fisherman had discovered a way of curing herring, so that it</p>
<p>could be transported to distant points. The herring fisheries</p>
<p>of the North Sea then became of great importance. But some</p>
<p>time during the thirteenth century, this useful little fish (for</p>
<p>reasons of its own) moved from the North Sea to the Baltic and</p>
<p>the cities of that inland sea began to make money. All the</p>
<p>world now sailed to the Baltic to catch herring and as that fish</p>
<p>could only be caught during a few months each year (the rest</p>
<p>of the time it spends in deep water, raising large families of</p>
<p>little herrings) the ships would have been idle during the rest</p>
<p>of the time unless they had found another occupation. They</p>
<p>were then used to carry the wheat of northern and central Russia</p>
<p>to southern and western Europe. On the return voyage</p>
<p>they brought spices and silks and carpets and Oriental rugs</p>
<p>from Venice and Genoa to Bruges and Hamburg and Bremen.</p>
<p>Out of such simple beginnings there developed an important</p>
<p>system of international trade which reached from the</p>
<p>manufacturing cities of Bruges and Ghent (where the almighty</p>
<p>guilds fought pitched battles with the kings of France and</p>
<p>England and established a labour tyranny which completely</p>
<p>ruined both the employers and the workmen) to the Republic</p>
<p>of Novgorod in northern Russia, which was a mighty city until</p>
<p>Tsar Ivan, who distrusted all merchants, took the town and</p>
<p>killed sixty thousand people in less than a month&#x27;s time and</p>
<p>reduced the survivors to beggary.</p>
<p>That they might protect themselves against pirates and</p>
<p>excessive tolls and annoying legislation, the merchants of the</p>
<p>north founded a protective league which was called the</p>
<p>``Hansa.&#x27;&#x27; The Hansa, which had its headquarters in Lubeck,</p>
<p>was a voluntary association of more than one hundred cities.</p>
<p>The association maintained a navy of its own which patrolled</p>
<p>the seas and fought and defeated the Kings of England and</p>
<p>Denmark when they dared to interfere with the rights and the</p>
<p>privileges of the mighty Hanseatic merchants.</p>
<p>I wish that I had more space to tell you some of the wonderful</p>
<p>stories of this strange commerce which was carried on</p>
<p>across the high mountains and across the deep seas amidst</p>
<p>such dangers that every voyage became a glorious adventure.</p>
<p>But it would take several volumes and it cannot be done here.</p>
<p>Besides, I hope that I have told you enough about the Middle</p>
<p>Ages to make you curious to read more in the excellent books</p>
<p>of which I shall give you a list at the end of this volume.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages, as I have tried to show you, had been a</p>
<p>period of very slow progress. The people who were in power</p>
<p>believed that ``progress&#x27;&#x27; was a very undesirable invention of</p>
<p>the Evil One and ought to be discouraged, and as they hap-</p>
<p>pened to occupy the seats of the mighty, it was easy to enforce</p>
<p>their will upon the patient serfs and the illiterate knights.</p>
<p>Here and there a few brave souls sometimes ventured forth into</p>
<p>the forbidden region of science, but they fared badly and were</p>
<p>considered lucky when they escaped with their lives and a jail</p>
<p>sentence of twenty years.</p>
<p>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the flood of</p>
<p>international commerce swept over western Europe as the Nile</p>
<p>had swept across the valley of ancient Egypt. It left behind</p>
<p>a fertile sediment of prosperity. Prosperity meant leisure</p>
<p>hours and these leisure hours gave both men and women a</p>
<p>chance to buy manuscripts and take an interest in literature</p>
<p>and art and music.</p>
<p>Then once more was the world filled with that divine curiosity</p>
<p>which has elevated man from the ranks of those other</p>
<p>mammals who are his distant cousins but who have remained</p>
<p>dumb, and the cities, of whose growth and development I have</p>
<p>told you in my last chapter, offered a safe shelter to these</p>
<p>brave pioneers who dared to leave the very narrow domain</p>
<p>of the established order of things.</p>
<p>They set to work. They opened the windows of their</p>
<p>cloistered and studious cells. A flood of sunlight entered the</p>
<p>dusty rooms and showed them the cobwebs which had gathered</p>
<p>during the long period of semi-darkness.</p>
<p>They began to clean house. Next they cleaned their gardens.</p>
<p>Then they went out into the open fields, outside the crumbling</p>
<p>town walls, and said, ``This is a good world. We are</p>
<p>glad that we live in it.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>At that moment, the Middle Ages came to an end and a new</p>
<p>world began.</p>
<p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>PEOPLE ONCE MORE DARED TO BE HAPPY</p>
<p>JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE ALIVE. THEY</p>
<p>TRIED TO SAVE THE REMAINS OF THE</p>
<p>OLDER AND MORE AGREEABLE CIVILISATION</p>
<p>OF ROME AND GREECE AND THEY</p>
<p>WERE SO PROUD OF THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS</p>
<p>THAT THEY SPOKE OF A RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>OR RE-BIRTH OF CIVILISATION</p>
<p>THE Renaissance was not a political or religious movement.</p>
<p>It was a state of mind.</p>
<p>The men of the Renaissance continued to be the obedient</p>
<p>sons of the mother church. They were subjects of kings and</p>
<p>emperors and dukes and murmured not.</p>
<p>But their outlook upon life was changed. They began to</p>
<p>wear different clothes--to speak a different language--to live</p>
<p>different lives in different houses.</p>
<p>They no longer concentrated all their thoughts and their</p>
<p>efforts upon the blessed existence that awaited them in Heaven.</p>
<p>They tried to establish their Paradise upon this planet, and,</p>
<p>truth to tell, they succeeded in a remarkable degree.</p>
<p>I have quite often warned you against the danger that</p>
<p>lies in historical dates. People take them too literally. They</p>
<p>think of the Middle Ages as a period of darkness and ignor-</p>
<p>ance. ``Click,&#x27;&#x27; says the clock, and the Renaissance begins and</p>
<p>cities and palaces are flooded with the bright sunlight of an</p>
<p>eager intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, it is quite impossible to draw such</p>
<p>sharp lines. The thirteenth century belonged most decidedly</p>
<p>to the Middle Ages. All historians agree upon that. But was</p>
<p>it a time of darkness and stagnation merely? By no means.</p>
<p>People were tremendously alive. Great states were being</p>
<p>founded. Large centres of commerce were being developed.</p>
<p>High above the turretted towers of the castle and the peaked</p>
<p>roof of the town-hall, rose the slender spire of the newly built</p>
<p>Gothic cathedral. Everywhere the world was in motion. The</p>
<p>high and mighty gentlemen of the city-hall, who had just become</p>
<p>conscious of their own strength (by way of their recently</p>
<p>acquired riches) were struggling for more power with their</p>
<p>feudal masters. The members of the guilds who had just become</p>
<p>aware of the important fact that ``numbers count&#x27;&#x27; were</p>
<p>fighting the high and mighty gentlemen of the city-hall. The</p>
<p>king and his shrewd advisers went fishing in these troubled</p>
<p>waters and caught many a shining bass of profit which they</p>
<p>proceeded to cook and eat before the noses of the surprised and</p>
<p>disappointed councillors and guild brethren.</p>
<p>To enliven the scenery during the long hours of evening</p>
<p>when the badly lighted streets did not invite further political</p>
<p>and economic dispute, the Troubadours and Minnesingers told</p>
<p>their stories and sang their songs of romance and adventure</p>
<p>and heroism and loyalty to all fair women. Meanwhile youth,</p>
<p>impatient of the slowness of progress, flocked to the universities,</p>
<p>and thereby hangs a story.</p>
<p>The Middle Ages were ``internationally minded.&#x27;&#x27; That</p>
<p>sounds difficult, but wait until I explain it to you. We modern</p>
<p>people are ``nationally minded.&#x27;&#x27; We are Americans or Englishmen</p>
<p>or Frenchmen or Italians and speak English or French</p>
<p>or Italian and go to English and French and Italian universities,</p>
<p>unless we want to specialise in some particular branch</p>
<p>of learning which is only taught elsewhere, and then we learn</p>
<p>another language and go to Munich or Madrid or Moscow.</p>
<p>But the people of the thirteenth or fourteenth century rarely</p>
<p>talked of themselves as Englishmen or Frenchmen or Italians.</p>
<p>They said, ``I am a citizen of Sheffield or Bordeaux or Genoa.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Because they all belonged to one and the same church they felt</p>
<p>a certain bond of brotherhood. And as all educated men could</p>
<p>speak Latin, they possessed an international language which</p>
<p>removed the stupid language barriers which have grown up</p>
<p>in modern Europe and which place the small nations at such</p>
<p>an enormous disadvantage. Just as an example, take the case</p>
<p>of Erasmus, the great preacher of tolerance and laughter, who</p>
<p>wrote his books in the sixteenth century. He was the native</p>
<p>of a small Dutch village. He wrote in Latin and all the world</p>
<p>was his audience. If he were alive to-day, he would write in</p>
<p>Dutch. Then only five or six million people would be able to</p>
<p>read him. To be understood by the rest of Europe and America,</p>
<p>his publishers would be obliged to translate his books into</p>
<p>twenty different languages. That would cost a lot of money</p>
<p>and most likely the publishers would never take the trouble</p>
<p>or the risk.</p>
<p>Six hundred years ago that could not happen. The greater</p>
<p>part of the people were still very ignorant and could not read</p>
<p>or write at all. But those who had mastered the difficult art</p>
<p>of handling the goose-quill belonged to an international republic</p>
<p>of letters which spread across the entire continent and which</p>
<p>knew of no boundaries and respected no limitations of language</p>
<p>or nationality. The universities were the strongholds of</p>
<p>this republic. Unlike modern fortifications, they did not follow</p>
<p>the frontier. They were to be found wherever a teacher</p>
<p>and a few pupils happened to find themselves together. There</p>
<p>again the Middle Ages and the Renaissance differed from our</p>
<p>own time. Nowadays, when a new university is built, the</p>
<p>process (almost invariably) is as follows: Some rich man</p>
<p>wants to do something for the community in which he lives or</p>
<p>a particular religious sect wants to build a school to keep its</p>
<p>faithful children under decent supervision, or a state needs doc-</p>
<p>tors and lawyers and teachers. The university begins as a</p>
<p>large sum of money which is deposited in a bank. This money</p>
<p>is then used to construct buildings and laboratories and dormitories.</p>
<p>Finally professional teachers are hired, entrance examinations</p>
<p>are held and the university is on the way.</p>
<p>But in the Middle Ages things were done differently. A wise man</p>
<p>said to himself, ``I have discovered a great truth. I must impart my</p>
<p>knowledge to others.&#x27;&#x27; And he began to preach his wisdom</p>
<p>wherever and whenever he could get a few people to listen to him,</p>
<p>like a modern soap-box orator. If he was an interesting speaker, the</p>
<p>crowd came and stayed. If he was dull, they shrugged their shoulders</p>
<p>and continued their way.</p>
<p>By and by certain young men began to come regularly to hear</p>
<p>the words of wisdom of this great teacher. They brought copybooks</p>
<p>with them and a little bottle of ink and a goose quill and</p>
<p>wrote down what seemed to be important. One day it rained.</p>
<p>The teacher and his pupils retired to an empty basement or</p>
<p>the room of the ``Professor.&#x27;&#x27; The learned man sat in his chair</p>
<p>and the boys sat on the floor. That was the beginning of the</p>
<p>University, the ``universitas,&#x27;&#x27; a corporation of professors and</p>
<p>students during the Middle Ages, when the ``teacher&#x27;&#x27; counted</p>
<p>for everything and the building in which he taught counted for</p>
<p>very little.</p>
<p>As an example, let me tell you of something that happened</p>
<p>in the ninth century. In the town of Salerno near Naples there</p>
<p>were a number of excellent physicians. They attracted people</p>
<p>desirous of learning the medical profession and for almost a</p>
<p>thousand years (until 1817) there was a university of Salerno</p>
<p>which taught the wisdom of Hippocrates, the great Greek doctor</p>
<p>who had practiced his art in ancient Hellas in the fifth</p>
<p>century before the birth of Christ.</p>
<p>Then there was Abelard, the young priest from Brittany,</p>
<p>who early in the twelfth century began to lecture on theology</p>
<p>and logic in Paris. Thousands of eager young men flocked</p>
<p>to the French city to hear him. Other priests who disagreed</p>
<p>with him stepped forward to explain their point of view. Paris</p>
<p>was soon filled with a clamouring multitude of Englishmen and</p>
<p>Germans and Italians and students from Sweden and Hungary</p>
<p>and around the old cathedral which stood on a little island in</p>
<p>the Seine there grew the famous University of Paris.</p>
<p>In Bologna in Italy, a monk by the name of Gratian had</p>
<p>compiled a text-book for those whose business it was to know</p>
<p>the laws of the church. Young priests and many laymen then</p>
<p>came from all over Europe to hear Gratian explain his ideas.</p>
<p>To protect themselves against the landlords and the innkeepers</p>
<p>and the boarding-house ladies of the city, they formed a corporation</p>
<p>(or University) and behold the beginning of the university</p>
<p>of Bologna.</p>
<p>Next there was a quarrel in the University of Paris. We do</p>
<p>not know what caused it, but a number of disgruntled teachers</p>
<p>together with their pupils crossed the channel and found a</p>
<p>hospitable home in n little village on the Thames called Oxford,</p>
<p>and in this way the famous University of Oxford came into</p>
<p>being. In the same way, in the year 1222, there had been a split</p>
<p>in the University of Bologna. The discontented teachers (again</p>
<p>followed by their pupils) had moved to Padua and their proud city</p>
<p>thenceforward boasted of a university of its own. And so it went</p>
<p>from Valladolid in Spain to Cracow in distant Poland and from</p>
<p>Poitiers in France to Rostock in Germany.</p>
<p>It is quite true that much of the teaching done by these</p>
<p>early professors would sound absurd to our ears, trained to</p>
<p>listen to logarithms and geometrical theorems. The point</p>
<p>however, which I want to make is this--the Middle Ages and</p>
<p>especially the thirteenth century were not a time when the</p>
<p>world stood entirely still. Among the younger generation,</p>
<p>there was life, there was enthusiasm, and there was a restless</p>
<p>if somewhat bashful asking of questions. And out of this</p>
<p>turmoil grew the Renaissance.</p>
<p>But just before the curtain went down upon the last scene</p>
<p>of the Mediaeval world, a solitary figure crossed the stage, of</p>
<p>whom you ought to know more than his mere name. This</p>
<p>man was called Dante. He was the son of a Florentine lawyer</p>
<p>who belonged to the Alighieri family and he saw the light of</p>
<p>day in the year 1265. He grew up in the city of his ancestors</p>
<p>while Giotto was painting his stories of the life of St. Francis</p>
<p>of Assisi upon the walls of the Church of the Holy Cross, but</p>
<p>often when he went to school, his frightened eyes would see the</p>
<p>puddles of blood which told of the terrible and endless warfare</p>
<p>that raged forever between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines,</p>
<p>the followers of the Pope and the adherents of the Emperors.</p>
<p>When he grew up, he became a Guelph, because his father</p>
<p>had been one before him, just as an American boy might become</p>
<p>a Democrat or a Republican, simply because his father</p>
<p>had happened to be a Democrat or a Republican. But after a</p>
<p>few years, Dante saw that Italy, unless united under a single</p>
<p>head, threatened to perish as a victim of the disordered jealousies</p>
<p>of a thousand little cities. Then he became a Ghilbeiline.</p>
<p>He looked for help beyond the Alps. He hoped that a</p>
<p>mighty emperor might come and re-establish unity and order.</p>
<p>Alas! he hoped in vain. The Ghibellines were driven out of</p>
<p>Florence in the year 1802. From that time on until the day</p>
<p>of his death amidst the dreary ruins of Ravenna, in the year</p>
<p>1321, Dante was a homeless wanderer, eating the bread of</p>
<p>charity at the table of rich patrons whose names would have</p>
<p>sunk into the deepest pit of oblivion but for this single fact,</p>
<p>that they had been kind to a poet in his misery. During the</p>
<p>many years of exile, Dante felt compelled to justify himself</p>
<p>and his actions when he had been a political leader in his</p>
<p>home-town, and when he had spent his days walking along</p>
<p>the banks of the Arno that he might catch a glimpse of the</p>
<p>lovely Beatrice Portinari, who died the wife of another man, a</p>
<p>dozen years before the Ghibelline disaster.</p>
<p>He had failed in the ambitions of his career. He had</p>
<p>faithfully served the town of is birth and before a corrupt</p>
<p>court he had been accused of stealing the public funds and</p>
<p>had been condemned to be burned alive should he venture</p>
<p>back within the realm of the city of Florence. To clear</p>
<p>himself before his own conscience and before his contemporaries,</p>
<p>Dante then created an Imaginary World and with great</p>
<p>detail he described the circumstances which had led to</p>
<p>his defeat and depicted the hopeless condition of greed and lust</p>
<p>and hatred which had turned his fair and beloved Italy into a</p>
<p>battlefield for the pitiless mercenaries of wicked and selfish</p>
<p>tyrants.</p>
<p>He tells us how on the Thursday before Easter of the year</p>
<p>1300 he had lost his way in a dense forest and how he found</p>
<p>his path barred by a leopard and a lion and a wolf. He gave</p>
<p>himself up for lost when a white figure appeared amidst the</p>
<p>trees. It was Virgil, the Roman poet and philosopher, sent</p>
<p>upon his errand of mercy by the Blessed Virgin and by Beatrice,</p>
<p>who from high Heaven watched over the fate of her</p>
<p>true lover. Virgil then takes Dante through Purgatory and</p>
<p>through Hell. Deeper and deeper the path leads them until</p>
<p>they reach the lowest pit where Lucifer himself stands frozen</p>
<p>into the eternal ice surrounded by the most terrible of sinners,</p>
<p>traitors and liars and those who have achieved fame and</p>
<p>success by lies and by deceit. But before the two wanderers</p>
<p>have reached this terrible spot, Dante has met all those who</p>
<p>in some way or other have played a role in the history of his</p>
<p>beloved city. Emperors and Popes, dashing knights and</p>
<p>whining usurers, they are all there, doomed to eternal punishment</p>
<p>or awaiting the day of deliverance, when they shall</p>
<p>leave Purgatory for Heaven.</p>
<p>It is a curious story. It is a handbook of everything the</p>
<p>people of the thirteenth century did and felt and feared and</p>
<p>prayed for. Through it all moves the figure of the lonely</p>
<p>Florentine exile, forever followed by the shadow of his own</p>
<p>despair.</p>
<p>And behold! when the gates of death were closing upon</p>
<p>the sad poet of the Middle Ages, the portals of life swung</p>
<p>open to the child who was to be the first of the men of the</p>
<p>Renaissance. That was Francesco Petrarca, the son of the</p>
<p>notary public of the little town of Arezzo.</p>
<p>Francesco&#x27;s father had belonged to the same political party</p>
<p>as Dante. He too had been exiled and thus it happened that</p>
<p>Petrarca (or Petrarch, as we call him) was born away from</p>
<p>Florence. At the age of fifteen he was sent to Montpellier</p>
<p>in France that he might become a lawyer like his father. But</p>
<p>the boy did not want to be a jurist. He hated the law. He</p>
<p>wanted to be a scholar and a poet--and because he wanted to</p>
<p>be a scholar and a poet beyond everything else, he became one,</p>
<p>as people of a strong will are apt to do. He made long</p>
<p>voyages, copying manuscripts in Flanders and in the cloisters</p>
<p>along the Rhine and in Paris and Liege and finally in Rome.</p>
<p>Then he went to live in a lonely valley of the wild mountains</p>
<p>of Vaucluse, and there he studied and wrote and soon he had</p>
<p>become so famous for his verse and for his learning that both</p>
<p>the University of Paris and the king of Naples invited him</p>
<p>to come and teach their students and subjects. On the way</p>
<p>to his new job, he was obliged to pass through Rome. The</p>
<p>people had heard of his fame as an editor of half-forgotten</p>
<p>Roman authors. They decided to honour him and in the</p>
<p>ancient forum of the Imperial City, Petrarch was crowned with</p>
<p>the laurel wreath of the Poet.</p>
<p>From that moment on, his life was an endless career of</p>
<p>honour and appreciation. He wrote the things which people</p>
<p>wanted most to hear. They were tired of theological</p>
<p>disputations. Poor Dante could wander through hell as much as</p>
<p>he wanted. But Petrarch wrote of love and of nature and the</p>
<p>sun and never mentioned those gloomy things which seemed</p>
<p>to have been the stock in trade of the last generation. And</p>
<p>when Petrarch came to a city, all the people flocked out to</p>
<p>meet him and he was received like a conquering hero. If he</p>
<p>happened to bring his young friend Boccaccio, the story teller,</p>
<p>with him, so much the better. They were both men of their</p>
<p>time, full of curiosity, willing to read everything once, digging</p>
<p>in forgotten and musty libraries that they might find still another</p>
<p>manuscript of Virgil or Ovid or Lucrece or any of the</p>
<p>other old Latin poets. They were good Christians. Of course</p>
<p>they were! Everyone was. But no need of going around with</p>
<p>a long face and wearing a dirty coat just because some day</p>
<p>or other you were going to die. Life was good. People were</p>
<p>meant to be happy. You desired proof of this? Very well.</p>
<p>Take a spade and dig into the soil. What did you find?</p>
<p>Beautiful old statues. Beautiful old vases. Ruins of ancient</p>
<p>buildings. All these things were made by the people of the</p>
<p>greatest empire that ever existed. They ruled all the world</p>
<p>for a thousand years. They were strong and rich and handsome</p>
<p>(just look at that bust of the Emperor Augustus!). Of</p>
<p>course, they were not Christians and they would never be</p>
<p>able to enter Heaven. At best they would spend their days</p>
<p>in purgatory, where Dante had just paid them a visit.</p>
<p>But who cared? To have lived in a world like that of</p>
<p>ancient Rome was heaven enough for any mortal being. And</p>
<p>anyway, we live but once. Let us be happy and cheerful for</p>
<p>the mere joy of existence.</p>
<p>Such, in short, was the spirit that had begun to fill the</p>
<p>narrow and crooked streets of the many little Italian cities.</p>
<p>You know what we mean by the ``bicycle craze&#x27;&#x27; or the</p>
<p>``automobile craze.&#x27;&#x27; Some one invents a bicycle. People who</p>
<p>for hundreds of thousands of years have moved slowly and</p>
<p>painfully from one place to another go ``crazy&#x27;&#x27; over the prospect</p>
<p>of rolling rapidly and easily over hill and dale. Then</p>
<p>a clever mechanic makes the first automobile. No longer is it</p>
<p>necessary to pedal and pedal and pedal. You just sit and</p>
<p>let little drops of gasoline do the work for you. Then everybody</p>
<p>wants an automobile. Everybody talks about Rolls-</p>
<p>Royces and Flivvers and carburetors and mileage and oil. Explorers</p>
<p>penetrate into the hearts of unknown countries that</p>
<p>they may find new supplies of gas. Forests arise in Sumatra</p>
<p>and in the Congo to supply us with rubber. Rubber and oil</p>
<p>become so valuable that people fight wars for their possession.</p>
<p>The whole world is ``automobile mad&#x27;&#x27; and little children can</p>
<p>say <code>car&#x27;&#x27; before they learn to whisper </code>papa&#x27;&#x27; and ``mamma.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century, the Italian people went crazy</p>
<p>about the newly discovered beauties of the buried world of</p>
<p>Rome. Soon their enthusiasm was shared by all the people of</p>
<p>western Europe. The finding of an unknown manuscript became</p>
<p>the excuse for a civic holiday. The man who wrote a</p>
<p>grammar became as popular as the fellow who nowadays invents</p>
<p>a new spark-plug. The humanist, the scholar who devoted his</p>
<p>time and his energies to a study of ``homo&#x27;&#x27; or mankind (instead</p>
<p>of wasting his hours upon fruitless theological investigations),</p>
<p>that man was regarded with greater honour and a deeper respect</p>
<p>than was ever bestowed upon a hero who had just conquered</p>
<p>all the Cannibal Islands.</p>
<p>In the midst of this intellectual upheaval, an event occurred</p>
<p>which greatly favoured the study of the ancient philosophers</p>
<p>and authors. The Turks were renewing their attacks upon</p>
<p>Europe. Constantinople, capital of the last remnant of the</p>
<p>original Roman Empire, was hard pressed. In the year 1393</p>
<p>the Emperor, Manuel Paleologue, sent Emmanuel Chrysoloras</p>
<p>to western Europe to explain the desperate state of old Byzantium</p>
<p>and to ask for aid. This aid never came. The Roman</p>
<p>Catholic world was more than willing to see the Greek Catholic</p>
<p>world go to the punishment that awaited such wicked heretics.</p>
<p>But however indifferent western Europe might be to the fate</p>
<p>of the Byzantines, they were greatly interested in the ancient</p>
<p>Greeks whose colonists had founded the city on the Bosphorus</p>
<p>ten centuries after the Trojan war. They wanted to learn</p>
<p>Greek that they might read Aristotle and Homer and Plato.</p>
<p>They wanted to learn it very badly, but they had no books and</p>
<p>no grammars and no teachers. The magistrates of Florence</p>
<p>heard of the visit of Chrysoloras. The people of their city</p>
<p>were ``crazy to learn Greek.&#x27;&#x27; Would he please come and</p>
<p>teach them? He would, and behold! the first professor of</p>
<p>Greek teaching alpha, beta, gamma to hundreds of eager young</p>
<p>men, begging their way to the city of the Arno, living in stables</p>
<p>and in dingy attics that they night learn how to decline the verb</p>
<p><gr paidenw="" paideneis="" paidenei=""> and enter into the companionship of</gr></p>
<p>Sophocles and Homer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the universities, the old schoolmen, teaching</p>
<p>their ancient theology and their antiquated logic; explaining</p>
<p>the hidden mysteries of the old Testament and discussing the</p>
<p>strange science of their Greek-Arabic-Spanish-Latin edition of</p>
<p>Aristotle, looked on in dismay and horror. Next, they turned</p>
<p>angry. This thing was going too far. The young men were</p>
<p>deserting the lecture halls of the established universities to</p>
<p>go and listen to some wild-eyed ``humanist&#x27;&#x27; with his newfangled</p>
<p>notions about a ``reborn civilization.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>They went to the authorities. They complained. But one</p>
<p>cannot force an unwilling horse to drink and one cannot</p>
<p>make unwilling ears listen to something which does not really</p>
<p>interest them. The schoolmen were losing ground rapidly. Here</p>
<p>and there they scored a short victory. They combined forces</p>
<p>with those fanatics who hated to see other people enjoy a</p>
<p>happiness which was foreign to their own souls. In Florence,</p>
<p>the centre of the Great Rebirth, a terrible fight was fought</p>
<p>between the old order and the new. A Dominican monk, sour</p>
<p>of face and bitter in his hatred of beauty, was the leader of</p>
<p>the mediaeval rear-guard. He fought a valiant battle. Day</p>
<p>after day he thundered his warnings of God&#x27;s holy wrath</p>
<p>through the wide halls of Santa Maria del Fiore. ``Repent,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>he cried, ``repent of your godlessness, of your joy in things</p>
<p>that are not holy!&#x27;&#x27; He began to hear voices and to see flaming</p>
<p>swords that flashed through the sky. He preached to the</p>
<p>little children that they might not fall into the errors of these</p>
<p>ways which were leading their fathers to perdition. He organised</p>
<p>companies of boy-scouts, devoted to the service of the</p>
<p>great God whose prophet he claimed to be. In a sudden moment</p>
<p>of frenzy, the frightened people promised to do penance</p>
<p>for their wicked love of beauty and pleasure. They carried</p>
<p>their books and their statues and their paintings to the market</p>
<p>place and celebrated a wild ``carnival of the vanities&#x27;&#x27; with holy</p>
<p>singing and most unholy dancing, while Savonarola applied his</p>
<p>torch to the accumulated treasures.</p>
<p>But when the ashes cooled down, the people began to realise</p>
<p>what they had lost. This terrible fanatic had made them destroy</p>
<p>that which they had come to love above all things. They</p>
<p>turned against him, Savonarola was thrown into jail. He was</p>
<p>tortured. But he refused to repent for anything he had done.</p>
<p>He was an honest man. He had tried to live a holy life. He</p>
<p>had willingly destroyed those who deliberately refused to</p>
<p>share his own point of view. It had been his duty to eradicate</p>
<p>evil wherever he found it. A love of heathenish books and</p>
<p>heathenish beauty in the eyes of this faithful son of the Church,</p>
<p>had been an evil. But he stood alone. He had fought the</p>
<p>battle of a time that was dead and gone. The Pope in Rome</p>
<p>never moved a finger to save him. On the contrary, he approved</p>
<p>of his ``faithful Florentines&#x27;&#x27; when they dragged Savonarola</p>
<p>to the gallows, hanged him and burned his body amidst</p>
<p>the cheerful howling and yelling of the mob.</p>
<p>It was a sad ending, but quite inevitable. Savonarola</p>
<p>would have been a great man in the eleventh century. In the</p>
<p>fifteenth century he was merely the leader of a lost cause.</p>
<p>For better or worse, the Middle Ages had come to an end when</p>
<p>the Pope had turned humanist and when the Vatican became</p>
<p>the most important museum of Roman and Greek antiquities.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF EXPRESSION</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE BEGAN TO FEEL THE NEED OF</p>
<p>GIVING EXPRESSION TO THEIR NEWLY</p>
<p>DISCOVERED JOY OF LIVING. THEY EXPRESSED</p>
<p>THEIR HAPPINESS IN POETRY</p>
<p>AND IN SCULPTURE AND IN ARCHITECTURE</p>
<p>AND IN PAINTING AND IN THE</p>
<p>BOOKS THEY PRINTED</p>
<p>IN the year 1471 there died a pious old man who had spent</p>
<p>seventy-two of his ninety-one years behind the sheltering walls</p>
<p>of the cloister of Mount St. Agnes near the good town of</p>
<p>Zwolle, the old Dutch Hanseatic city on the river Ysel. He</p>
<p>was known as Brother Thomas and because he had been born</p>
<p>in the village of Kempen, he was called Thomas a Kempis.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve he had been sent to Deventer, where</p>
<p>Gerhard Groot, a brilliant graduate of the universities of</p>
<p>Paris, Cologne and Prague, and famous as a wandering</p>
<p>preacher, had founded the Society of the Brothers of the</p>
<p>Common Life. The good brothers were humble laymen who</p>
<p>tried to live the simple life of the early Apostles of Christ</p>
<p>while working at their regular jobs as carpenters and house-</p>
<p>painters and stone masons. They maintained an excellent</p>
<p>school, that deserving boys of poor parents might be taught</p>
<p>the wisdom of the Fathers of the church. At this school,</p>
<p>little Thomas had learned how to conjugate Latin verbs and</p>
<p>how to copy manuscripts. Then he had taken his vows, had</p>
<p>put his little bundle of books upon his back, had wandered to</p>
<p>Zwolle and with a sigh of relief he had closed the door upon a</p>
<p>turbulent world which did not attract him.</p>
<p>Thomas lived in an age of turmoil, pestilence and sudden</p>
<p>death. In central Europe, in Bohemia, the devoted disciples of</p>
<p>Johannus Huss, the friend and follower of John Wycliffe, the</p>
<p>English reformer, were avenging with a terrible warfare the death</p>
<p>of their beloved leader who had been burned at the stake by order of</p>
<p>that same Council of Constance, which had promised him a safe-conduct</p>
<p>if he would come to Switzerland and explain his doctrines to the Pope,</p>
<p>the Emperor, twenty-three cardinals, thirty-three archbishops and bishops,</p>
<p>one hundred and fifty abbots and more than a hundred princes and</p>
<p>dukes who had gathered together to reform their church.</p>
<p>In the west, France had been fighting for a hundred years that</p>
<p>she might drive the English from her territories and just then was</p>
<p>saved from utter defeat by the fortunate appearance of Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>And no sooner had this struggle come to an end than France and Burgundy</p>
<p>were at each other&#x27;s throats, engaged upon a struggle of life and death</p>
<p>for the supremacy of western Europe.</p>
<p>In the south, a Pope at Rome was calling the curses of</p>
<p>Heaven down upon a second Pope who resided at Avignon,</p>
<p>in southern France, and who retaliated in kind. In the</p>
<p>far east the Turks were destroying the last remnants of the</p>
<p>Roman Empire and the Russians had started upon a final</p>
<p>crusade to crush the power of their Tartar masters.</p>
<p>But of all this, Brother Thomas in his quiet cell never</p>
<p>heard. He had his manuscripts and his own thoughts and</p>
<p>he was contented. He poured his love of God into a little</p>
<p>volume. He called it the Imitation of Christ. It has since</p>
<p>been translated into more languages than any other book</p>
<p>save the Bible. It has been read by quite as many people</p>
<p>as ever studied the Holy Scriptures. It has influenced the</p>
<p>lives of countless millions. And it was the work of a man</p>
<p>whose highest ideal of existence was expressed in the simple</p>
<p>wish that ``he might quietly spend his days sitting in a little</p>
<p>corner with a little book.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Good Brother Thomas represented the purest ideals of the</p>
<p>Middle Ages. Surrounded on all sides by the forces of the</p>
<p>victorious Renaissance, with the humanists loudly proclaiming</p>
<p>the coming of modern times, the Middle Ages gathered</p>
<p>strength for a last sally. Monasteries were reformed. Monks</p>
<p>gave up the habits of riches and vice. Simple, straightforward</p>
<p>and honest men, by the example of their blameless</p>
<p>and devout lives, tried to bring the people back to the ways of</p>
<p>righteousness and humble resignation to the will of God. But</p>
<p>all to no avail. The new world rushed past these good people.</p>
<p>The days of quiet meditation were gone. The great era of</p>
<p>``expression&#x27;&#x27; had begun.</p>
<p>Here and now let me say that I am sorry that I must use</p>
<p>so many ``big words.&#x27;&#x27; I wish that I could write this history in</p>
<p>words of one syllable. But it cannot be done. You cannot</p>
<p>write a text-book of geometry without reference to a hypotenuse</p>
<p>and triangles and a rectangular parallelopiped. You</p>
<p>simply have to learn what those words mean or do without</p>
<p>mathematics. In history (and in all life) you will eventually</p>
<p>be obliged to learn the meaning of many strange words of</p>
<p>Latin and Greek origin. Why not do it now?</p>
<p>When I say that the Renaissance was an era of expression,</p>
<p>I mean this: People were no longer contented to be the</p>
<p>audience and sit still while the emperor and the pope told</p>
<p>them what to do and what to think. They wanted to be actors</p>
<p>upon the stage of life. They insisted upon giving ``expression&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>to their own individual ideas. If a man happened to be interested</p>
<p>in statesmanship like the Florentine historian, Niccolo</p>
<p>Macchiavelli, then he ``expressed&#x27;&#x27; himself in his books which</p>
<p>revealed his own idea of a successful state and an efficient</p>
<p>ruler. If on the other hand he had a liking for painting, he</p>
<p>``expressed&#x27;&#x27; his love for beautiful lines and lovely colours in</p>
<p>the pictures which have made the names of Giotto, Fra Angelico,</p>
<p>Rafael and a thousand others household words wherever</p>
<p>people have learned to care for those things which express</p>
<p>a true and lasting beauty.</p>
<p>If this love for colour and line happened to be combined with</p>
<p>an interest in mechanics and hydraulics, the result was a Leonardo</p>
<p>da Vinci, who painted his pictures, experimented with</p>
<p>his balloons and flying machines, drained the marshes of the</p>
<p>Lombardian plains and ``expressed&#x27;&#x27; his joy and interest in all</p>
<p>things between Heaven and Earth in prose, in painting, in</p>
<p>sculpture and in curiously conceived engines. When a man of</p>
<p>gigantic strength, like Michael Angelo, found the brush and</p>
<p>the palette too soft for his strong hands, he turned to sculpture</p>
<p>and to architecture, and hacked the most terrific creatures out</p>
<p>of heavy blocks of marble and drew the plans for the church</p>
<p>of St. Peter, the most concrete ``expression&#x27;&#x27; of the glories</p>
<p>of the triumphant church. And so it went.</p>
<p>All Italy (and very soon all of Europe) was filled with</p>
<p>men and women who lived that they might add their mite to</p>
<p>the sum total of our accumulated treasures of knowledge and</p>
<p>beauty and wisdom. In Germany, in the city of Mainz, Johann</p>
<p>zum Gansefleisch, commonly known as Johann Gutenberg, had</p>
<p>just invented a new method of copying books. He had studied</p>
<p>the old woodcuts and had perfected a system by which individual</p>
<p>letters of soft lead could be placed in such a way that</p>
<p>they formed words and whole pages. It is true, he soon lost</p>
<p>all his money in a law-suit which had to do with the original</p>
<p>invention of the press. He died in poverty, but the ``expression&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>of his particular inventive genius lived after him.</p>
<p>Soon Aldus in Venice and Etienne in Paris and Plantin in</p>
<p>Antwerp and Froben in Basel were flooding the world with</p>
<p>carefully edited editions of the classics printed in the Gothic</p>
<p>letters of the Gutenberg Bible, or printed in the Italian type</p>
<p>which we use in this book, or printed in Greek letters, or in</p>
<p>Hebrew.</p>
<p>Then the whole world became the eager audience of those</p>
<p>who had something to say. The day when learning had been</p>
<p>a monopoly of a privileged few came to an end. And the</p>
<p>last excuse for ignorance was removed from this world, when</p>
<p>Elzevier of Haarlem began to print his cheap and popular</p>
<p>editions. Then Aristotle and Plato, Virgil and Horace and</p>
<p>Pliny, all the goodly company of the ancient authors and</p>
<p>philosophers and scientists, offered to become man&#x27;s faithful</p>
<p>friend in exchange for a few paltry pennies. Humanism had</p>
<p>made all men free and equal before the printed word.</p>
<p>THE GREAT DISCOVERIES</p>
<p>BUT NOW THAT PEOPLE HAD BROKEN</p>
<p>THROUGH THE BONDS OF THEIR NARROW</p>
<p>MEDIAEVAL LIMITATIONS, THEY HAD TO</p>
<p>HAVE MORE ROOM FOR THEIR WANDERINGS.</p>
<p>THE EUROPEAN WORLD HAD</p>
<p>GROWN TOO SMALL FOR THEIR AMBITIONS.</p>
<p>IT WAS THE TIME OF THE GREAT</p>
<p>VOYAGES OF DISCOVERY</p>
<p>THE Crusades had been a lesson in the liberal art of travelling.</p>
<p>But very few people had ever ventured beyond the well-</p>
<p>known beaten track which led from Venice to Jaffe. In the</p>
<p>thirteenth century the Polo brothers, merchants of Venice,</p>
<p>had wandered across the great Mongolian desert and after</p>
<p>climbing mountains as high as the moon, they had found their</p>
<p>way to the court of the great Khan of Cathay, the mighty</p>
<p>emperor of China. The son of one of the Polos, by the name</p>
<p>of Marco, had written a book about their adventures, which</p>
<p>covered a period of more than twenty years. The astonished</p>
<p>world had gaped at his descriptions of the golden towers of</p>
<p>the strange island of Zipangu, which was his Italian way of</p>
<p>spelling Japan. Many people had wanted to go east, that</p>
<p>they might find this gold-land and grow rich. But the trip was</p>
<p>too far and too dangerous and so they stayed at home.</p>
<p>Of course, there was always the possibility of making the</p>
<p>voyage by sea. But the sea was very unpopular in the Middle</p>
<p>Ages and for many very good reasons. In the first place, ships</p>
<p>were very small. The vessels on which Magellan made his</p>
<p>famous trip around the world, which lasted many years, were</p>
<p>not as large as a modern ferryboat. They carried from twenty</p>
<p>to fifty men, who lived in dingy quarters (too low to allow any</p>
<p>of them to stand up straight) and the sailors were obliged to</p>
<p>eat poorly cooked food as the kitchen arrangements were very</p>
<p>bad and no fire could be made whenever the weather was the</p>
<p>least bit rough. The mediaeval world knew how to pickle herring</p>
<p>and how to dry fish. But there were no canned goods</p>
<p>and fresh vegetables were never seen on the bill of fare as</p>
<p>soon as the coast had been left behind. Water was carried in</p>
<p>small barrels. It soon became stale and then tasted of rotten</p>
<p>wood and iron rust and was full of slimy growing things. As</p>
<p>the people of the Middle Ages knew nothing about microbes</p>
<p>(Roger Bacon, the learned monk of the thirteenth century</p>
<p>seems to have suspected their existence, but he wisely kept</p>
<p>his discovery to himself) they often drank unclean water and</p>
<p>sometimes the whole crew died of typhoid fever. Indeed the</p>
<p>mortality on board the ships of the earliest navigators was</p>
<p>terrible. Of the two hundred sailors who in the year 1519 left</p>
<p>Seville to accompany Magellan on his famous voyage around</p>
<p>the world, only eighteen returned. As late as the seventeenth</p>
<p>century when there was a brisk trade between western Europe</p>
<p>and the Indies, a mortality of 40 percent was nothing unusual</p>
<p>for a trip from Amsterdam to Batavia and back. The greater</p>
<p>part of these victims died of scurvy, a disease which is caused</p>
<p>by lack of fresh vegetables and which affects the gums and</p>
<p>poisons the blood until the patient dies of sheer exhaustion.</p>
<p>Under those circumstances you will understand that the sea</p>
<p>did not attract the best elements of the population. Famous</p>
<p>discoverers like Magellan and Columbus and Vasco da Gama</p>
<p>travelled at the head of crews that were almost entirely composed</p>
<p>of ex-jailbirds, future murderers and pickpockets out</p>
<p>of a Job.</p>
<p>These navigators certainly deserve our admiration for the</p>
<p>courage and the pluck with which they accomplished their</p>
<p>hopeless tasks in the face of difficulties of which the people of</p>
<p>our own comfortable world can have no conception. Their</p>
<p>ships were leaky. The rigging was clumsy. Since the middle</p>
<p>of the thirteenth century they had possessed some sort of a</p>
<p>compass (which had come to Europe from China by way of</p>
<p>Arabia and the Crusades) but they had very bad and incorrect</p>
<p>maps. They set their course by God and by guess. If luck</p>
<p>was with them they returned after one or two or three years.</p>
<p>In the other case, their bleeched bones remained behind on</p>
<p>some lonely beach. But they were true pioneers. They gambled</p>
<p>with luck. Life to them was a glorious adventure. And</p>
<p>all the suffering, the thirst and the hunger and the pain were</p>
<p>forgotten when their eyes beheld the dim outlines of a new coast</p>
<p>or the placid waters of an ocean that had lain forgotten since</p>
<p>the beginning of time.</p>
<p>Again I wish that I could make this book a thousand pages</p>
<p>long. The subject of the early discoveries is so fascinating.</p>
<p>But history, to give you a true idea of past times, should be</p>
<p>like those etchings which Rembrandt used to make. It should</p>
<p>cast a vivid light on certain important causes, on those which</p>
<p>are best and greatest. All the rest should be left in the shadow</p>
<p>or should be indicated by a few lines. And in this chapter I</p>
<p>can only give you a short list of the most important discoveries.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all during the fourteenth and fifteenth</p>
<p>centuries the navigators were trying to accomplish just ONE</p>
<p>THING--they wanted to find a comfortable and safe road to the</p>
<p>empire of Cathay (China), to the island of Zipangu (Japan)</p>
<p>and to those mysterious islands, where grew the spices which</p>
<p>the mediaeval world had come to like since the days of the</p>
<p>Crusades, and which people needed in those days before the</p>
<p>introduction of cold storage, when meat and fish spoiled very</p>
<p>quickly and could only be eaten after a liberal sprinkling of</p>
<p>pepper or nutmeg.</p>
<p>The Venetians and the Genoese had been the great navigators</p>
<p>of the Mediterranean, but the honour for exploring the</p>
<p>coast of the Atlantic goes to the Portuguese. Spain and Portugal</p>
<p>were full of that patriotic energy which their age-old</p>
<p>struggle against the Moorish invaders had developed. Such</p>
<p>energy, once it exists, can easily be forced into new channels.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century, King Alphonso III had conquered</p>
<p>the kingdom of Algarve in the southwestern corner of the</p>
<p>Spanish peninsula and had added it to his dominions. In the</p>
<p>next century, the Portuguese had turned the tables on the</p>
<p>Mohammedans, had crossed the straits of Gibraltar and had</p>
<p>taken possession of Ceuta, opposite the Arabic city of Ta&#x27;Rifa</p>
<p>(a word which in Arabic means ``inventory&#x27;&#x27; and which by way</p>
<p>of the Spanish language has come down to us as ``tariff,&#x27;&#x27;) and</p>
<p>Tangiers, which became the capital of an African addition to</p>
<p>Algarve.</p>
<p>They were ready to begin their career as explorers.</p>
<p>In the year 1415, Prince Henry, known as Henry the</p>
<p>Navigator, the son of John I of Portugal and Philippa, the</p>
<p>daughter of John of Gaunt (about whom you can read in</p>
<p>Richard II, a play by William Shakespeare) began to make</p>
<p>preparations for the systematic exploration of northwestern</p>
<p>Africa. Before this, that hot and sandy coast had been visited</p>
<p>by the Phoenicians and by the Norsemen, who remembered it</p>
<p>as the home of the hairy ``wild man&#x27;&#x27; whom we have come to</p>
<p>know as the gorilla. One after another, Prince Henry</p>
<p>and his captains discovered the Canary Islands--re-discovered</p>
<p>the island of Madeira which a century before had been visited</p>
<p>by a Genoese ship, carefully charted the Azores which had</p>
<p>been vaguely known to both the Portuguese and the Spaniards,</p>
<p>and caught a glimpse of the mouth of the Senegal River on</p>
<p>the west coast of Africa, which they supposed to be the western</p>
<p>mouth of the Nile. At last, by the middle of the Fifteenth</p>
<p>Century, they saw Cape Verde, or the Green Cape, and the</p>
<p>Cape Verde Islands, which lie almost halfway between the</p>
<p>coast of Africa and Brazil.</p>
<p>But Henry did not restrict himself in his investigations to</p>
<p>the waters of the Ocean. He was Grand Master of the Order</p>
<p>of Christ. This was a Portuguese continuation of the crusading</p>
<p>order of the Templars which had been abolished by</p>
<p>Pope Clement V in the year 1312 at the request of King</p>
<p>Philip the Fair of France, who had improved the occasion by</p>
<p>burning his own Templars at the stake and stealing all their</p>
<p>possessions. Prince Henry used the revenues of the domains</p>
<p>of his religious order to equip several expeditions which explored</p>
<p>the hinterland of the Sahara and of the coast of Guinea.</p>
<p>But he was still very much a son of the Middle Ages and</p>
<p>spent a great deal of time and wasted a lot of money upon a</p>
<p>search for the mysterious ``Presser John,&#x27;&#x27; the mythical Christian</p>
<p>Priest who was said to be the Emperor of a vast empire</p>
<p>``situated somewhere in the east.&#x27;&#x27; The story of this strange</p>
<p>potentate had first been told in Europe in the middle of the</p>
<p>twelfth century. For three hundred years people had tried</p>
<p>to find ``Presser John&#x27;&#x27; and his descendants Henry took part</p>
<p>in the search. Thirty years after his death, the riddle was</p>
<p>solved.</p>
<p>In the year 1486 Bartholomew Diaz, trying to find the land</p>
<p>of Prester John by sea, had reached the southernmost point</p>
<p>of Africa. At first he called it the Storm Cape, on account of</p>
<p>the strong winds which had prevented him from continuing his</p>
<p>voyage toward the east, but the Lisbon pilots who understood</p>
<p>the importance of this discovery in their quest for the India</p>
<p>water route, changed the name into that of the Cape of Good</p>
<p>Hope.</p>
<p>One year later, Pedro de Covilham, provided with letters</p>
<p>of credit on the house of Medici, started upon a similar mission</p>
<p>by land. He crossed the Mediterranean and after leaving</p>
<p>Egypt, he travelled southward. He reached Aden, and from</p>
<p>there, travelling through the waters of the Persian Gulf which</p>
<p>few white men had seen since the days of Alexander the Great,</p>
<p>eighteen centuries before, he visited Goa and Calicut on the</p>
<p>coast of India where he got a great deal of news about the</p>
<p>island of the Moon (Madagascar) which was supposed to lie</p>
<p>halfway between Africa and India. Then he returned, paid</p>
<p>a secret visit to Mecca and to Medina, crossed the Red Sea</p>
<p>once more and in the year 1490 he discovered the realm of</p>
<p>Prester John, who was no one less than the Black Negus (or</p>
<p>King) of Abyssinia, whose ancestors had adopted Christianity</p>
<p>in the fourth century, seven hundred years before the Christian</p>
<p>missionaries had found their way to Scandinavia.</p>
<p>These many voyages had convinced the Portuguese geographers</p>
<p>and cartographers that while the voyage to the Indies</p>
<p>by an eastern sea-route was possible, it was by no means easy.</p>
<p>Then there arose a great debate. Some people wanted to continue</p>
<p>the explorations east of the Cape of Good Hope. Others</p>
<p>said, ``No, we must sail west across the Atlantic and then we</p>
<p>shall reach Cathay.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Let us state right here that most intelligent people of that</p>
<p>day were firmly convinced that the earth was not as flat as a</p>
<p>pancake but was round. The Ptolemean system of the universe,</p>
<p>invented and duly described by Claudius Ptolemy, the great</p>
<p>Egyptian geographer, who had lived in the second century of</p>
<p>our era, which had served the simple needs of the men of the</p>
<p>Middle Ages, had long been discarded by the scientists of the</p>
<p>Renaissance. They had accepted the doctrine of the Polish</p>
<p>mathematician, Nicolaus Copernicus, whose studies had con-</p>
<p>vinced him that the earth was one of a number of round planets</p>
<p>which turned around the sun, a discovery which he did not venture</p>
<p>to publish for thirty-six years (it was printed in 1548,</p>
<p>the year of his death) from fear of the Holy Inquisition, a</p>
<p>Papal court which had been established in the thirteenth century</p>
<p>when the heresies of the Albigenses and the Waldenses</p>
<p>in France and in Italy (very mild heresies of devoutly pious</p>
<p>people who did not believe in private property and preferred</p>
<p>to live in Christ-like poverty) had for a moment threatened the</p>
<p>absolute power of the bishops of Rome. But the belief in the</p>
<p>roundness of the earth was common among the nautical experts</p>
<p>and, as I said, they were now debating the respective</p>
<p>advantages of the eastern and the western routes.</p>
<p>Among the advocates of the western route was a Genoese</p>
<p>mariner by the name of Cristoforo Colombo. He was the son</p>
<p>of a wool merchant. He seems to have been a student at the</p>
<p>University of Pavia where he specialised in mathematics and</p>
<p>geometry. Then he took up his father&#x27;s trade but soon we find</p>
<p>him in Chios in the eastern Mediterranean travelling on business.</p>
<p>Thereafter we hear of voyages to England but whether</p>
<p>he went north in search of wool or as the captain of a ship we</p>
<p>do not know. In February of the year 1477, Colombo (if we</p>
<p>are to believe his own words) visited Iceland, but very likely</p>
<p>he only got as far as the Faroe Islands which are cold enough</p>
<p>in February to be mistaken for Iceland by any one. Here</p>
<p>Colombo met the descendants of those brave Norsemen who</p>
<p>in the tenth century had settled in Greenland and who had</p>
<p>visited America in the eleventh century, when Leif&#x27;s vessel</p>
<p>had been blown to the coast of Vineland, or Labrador.</p>
<p>What had become of those far western colonies no one</p>
<p>knew. The American colony of Thorfinn Karlsefne, the husband</p>
<p>of the widow of Leif&#x27;s brother Thorstein, founded in the</p>
<p>year 1003, had been discontinued three years later on account</p>
<p>of the hostility of the Esquimaux. As for Greenland, not a</p>
<p>word had been heard from the settlers since the year 1440.</p>
<p>Very likely the Greenlanders had all died of the Black Death.</p>
<p>which had just killed half the people of Norway. However</p>
<p>that might be, the tradition of a ``vast land in the distant west&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>still survived among the people of the Faroe and Iceland, and</p>
<p>Colombo must have heard of it. He gathered further information</p>
<p>among the fishermen of the northern Scottish islands and</p>
<p>then went to Portugal where he married the daughter of one</p>
<p>of the captains who had served under Prince Henry the</p>
<p>Navigator.</p>
<p>From that moment on (the year 1478) he devoted himself</p>
<p>to the quest of the western route to the Indies. He sent his</p>
<p>plans for such a voyage to the courts of Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p>The Portuguese, who felt certain that they possessed a monop-</p>
<p>oly of the eastern route, would not listen to his plans. In</p>
<p>Spain, Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile, whose</p>
<p>marriage in 1469 had made Spain into a single kingdom, were</p>
<p>busy driving the Moors from their last stronghold, Granada.</p>
<p>They had no money for risky expeditions. They needed every</p>
<p>peseta for their soldiers.</p>
<p>Few people were ever forced to fight as desperately for</p>
<p>their ideas as this brave Italian. But the story of Colombo</p>
<p>(or Colon or Columbus, as we call him,) is too well known to</p>
<p>bear repeating. The Moors surrendered Granada on the second</p>
<p>of January of the year 1492. In the month of April of the</p>
<p>same year, Columbus signed a contract with the King and</p>
<p>Queen of Spain. On Friday, the 3rd of August, he left Palos</p>
<p>with three little ships and a crew of 88 men, many of whom</p>
<p>were criminals who had been offered indemnity of punishment</p>
<p>if they joined the expedition. At two o&#x27;clock in the morning</p>
<p>of Friday, the 12th of October, Columbus discovered land. On</p>
<p>the fourth of January of the year 1493, Columbus waved farewell</p>
<p>to the 44 men of the little fortress of La Navidad (none</p>
<p>of whom was ever again seen alive) and returned homeward.</p>
<p>By the middle of February he reached the Azores where the</p>
<p>Portuguese threatened to throw him into gaol. On the fifteenth</p>
<p>of March, 1493, the admiral reached Palos and together with</p>
<p>his Indians (for he was convinced that he had discovered some</p>
<p>outlying islands of the Indies and called the natives red</p>
<p>Indians) he hastened to Barcelona to tell his faithful patrons</p>
<p>that he had been successful and that the road to the gold and</p>
<p>the silver of Cathay and Zipangu was at the disposal of their</p>
<p>most Catholic Majesties.</p>
<p>Alas, Columbus never knew the truth. Towards the end</p>
<p>of his life, on his fourth voyage, when he had touched the mainland</p>
<p>of South America, he may have suspected that all was</p>
<p>not well with his discovery. But he died in the firm belief</p>
<p>that there was no solid continent between Europe and Asia</p>
<p>and that he had found the direct route to China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Portuguese, sticking to their eastern route,</p>
<p>had been more fortunate. In the year 1498, Vasco da Gama</p>
<p>had been able to reach the coast of Malabar and return safely</p>
<p>to Lisbon with a cargo of spice. In the year 1502 he had</p>
<p>repeated the visit. But along the western route, the work of</p>
<p>exploration had been most disappointing. In 1497 and 1498</p>
<p>John and Sebastian Cabot had tried to find a passage to Japan</p>
<p>but they had seen nothing but the snowbound coasts and the</p>
<p>rocks of Newfoundland, which had first been sighted by the</p>
<p>Northmen, five centuries before. Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine</p>
<p>who became the Pilot Major of Spain, and who gave his</p>
<p>name to our continent, had explored the coast of Brazil, but</p>
<p>had found not a trace of the Indies.</p>
<p>In the year 1513, seven years after the death of Columbus,</p>
<p>the truth at last began to dawn upon the geographers of</p>
<p>Europe. Vasco Nunez de Balboa had crossed the Isthmus of</p>
<p>Panama, had climbed the famous peak in Darien, and had</p>
<p>looked down upon a vast expanse of water which seemed to</p>
<p>suggest the existence of another ocean.</p>
<p>Finally in the year 1519 a fleet of five small Spanish ships</p>
<p>under command of the Portuguese navigator, Ferdinand de</p>
<p>Magellan, sailed westward (and not eastward since that route,</p>
<p>was absolutely in the hands of the Portuguese who allowed no</p>
<p>competition) in search of the Spice Islands. Magellan crossed</p>
<p>the Atlantic between Africa and Brazil and sailed southward.</p>
<p>He reached a narrow channel between the southernmost point</p>
<p>of Patagonia, the ``land of the people with the big feet,&#x27;&#x27; and</p>
<p>the Fire Island (so named on account of a fire, the only sign of</p>
<p>the existence of natives, which the sailors watched one night).</p>
<p>For almost five weeks the ships of Magellan were at the mercy</p>
<p>of the terrible storms and blizzards which swept through the</p>
<p>straits. A mutiny broke out among the sailors. Magellan</p>
<p>suppressed it with terrible severity and sent two of his men</p>
<p>on shore where they were left to repent of their sins at leisure.</p>
<p>At last the storms quieted down, the channel broadened, and</p>
<p>Magellan entered a new ocean. Its waves were quiet and</p>
<p>placid. He called it the Peaceful Sea, the Mare Pacifico.</p>
<p>Then he continued in a western direction. He sailed for</p>
<p>ninety-eight days without seeing land. His people almost</p>
<p>perished from hunger and thirst and ate the rats that infested</p>
<p>the ships, and when these were all gone they chewed pieces of</p>
<p>sail to still their gnawing hunger.</p>
<p>In March of the year 1521 they saw land. Magellan called</p>
<p>it the land of the Ladrones (which means robbers) because the</p>
<p>natives stole everything they could lay hands on. Then further</p>
<p>westward to the Spice Islands!</p>
<p>Again land was sighted. A group of lonely islands. Magellan</p>
<p>called them the Philippines, after Philip, the son of his</p>
<p>master Charles V, the Philip II of unpleasant historical memory.</p>
<p>At first Magellan was well received, but when he used</p>
<p>the guns of his ships to make Christian converts he was killed</p>
<p>by the aborigines, together with a number of his captains and</p>
<p>sailors. The survivors burned one of the three remaining ships</p>
<p>and continued their voyage. They found the Moluccas, the</p>
<p>famous Spice Islands; they sighted Borneo and reached Tidor.</p>
<p>There, one of the two ships, too leaky to be of further use,</p>
<p>remained behind with her crew. The ``Vittoria,&#x27;&#x27; under Sebastian</p>
<p>del Cano, crossed the Indian Ocean, missed seeing the</p>
<p>northern coast of Australia (which was not discovered until</p>
<p>the first half of the seventeenth century when ships of the</p>
<p>Dutch East India Company explored this flat and inhospitable</p>
<p>land), and after great hardships reached Spain.</p>
<p>This was the most notable of all voyages. It had taken</p>
<p>three years. It had been accomplished at a great cost both of</p>
<p>men and money. But it had established the fact that the earth</p>
<p>was round and that the new lands discovered by Columbus were</p>
<p>not a part of the Indies but a separate continent. From that</p>
<p>time on, Spain and Portugal devoted all their energies to the</p>
<p>development of their Indian and American trade. To prevent</p>
<p>an armed conflict between the rivals, Pope Alexander VI (the</p>
<p>only avowed heathen who was ever elected to this most holy</p>
<p>office) had obligingly divided the world into two equal parts</p>
<p>by a line of demarcation which followed the 50th degree of</p>
<p>longitude west of Greenwich, the so-called division of Tordesillas</p>
<p>of 1494. The Portuguese were to establish their colonies</p>
<p>to the east of this line, the Spaniards were to have theirs</p>
<p>to the west. This accounts for the fact that the entire American</p>
<p>continent with the exception of Brazil became Spanish and</p>
<p>that all of the Indies and most of Africa became Portuguese</p>
<p>until the English and the Dutch colonists (who had no respect</p>
<p>for Papal decisions) took these possessions away in the seventeenth</p>
<p>and eighteenth centuries.</p>
<p>When news of the discovery of Columbus reached the</p>
<p>Rialto of Venice, the Wall street of the Middle Ages, there</p>
<p>was a terrible panic. Stocks and bonds went down 40 and 50</p>
<p>percent. After a short while, when it appeared that Columbus</p>
<p>had failed to find the road to Cathay, the Venetian merchants</p>
<p>recovered from their fright. But the voyages of da Gama and</p>
<p>Magellan proved the practical possibilities of an eastern water-</p>
<p>route to the Indies. Then the rulers of Genoa and Venice,</p>
<p>the two great commercial centres of the Middle Ages and the</p>
<p>Renaissance, began to be sorry that they had refused to listen</p>
<p>to Columbus. But it was too late. Their Mediterranean became</p>
<p>an inland sea. The overland trade to the Indies and</p>
<p>China dwindled to insignificant proportions. The old days</p>
<p>of Italian glory were gone. The Atlantic became the new</p>
<p>centre of commerce and therefore the centre of civilisation.</p>
<p>It has remained so ever since.</p>
<p>See how strangely civilisation has progressed since those</p>
<p>early days, fifty centuries before, when the inhabitants of the</p>
<p>Valley of the Nile began to keep a written record of history,</p>
<p>From the river Nile, it went to Mesopotamia, the land between</p>
<p>the rivers. Then came the turn of Crete and Greece and</p>
<p>Rome. An inland sea became the centre of trade and the cities</p>
<p>along the Mediterranean were the home of art and science and</p>
<p>philosophy and learning. In the sixteenth century it moved</p>
<p>westward once more and made the countries that border upon</p>
<p>the Atlantic become the masters of the earth.</p>
<p>There are those who say that the world war and the suicide</p>
<p>of the great European nations has greatly diminished the</p>
<p>importance of the Atlantic Ocean. They expect to see civilisation</p>
<p>cross the American continent and find a new home in the</p>
<p>Pacific. But I doubt this.</p>
<p>The westward trip was accompanied by a steady increase in</p>
<p>the size of ships and a broadening of the knowledge of the navigators.</p>
<p>The flat-bottomed vessels of the Nile and the Euphrates</p>
<p>were replaced by the sailing vessels of the Phoenicians, the</p>
<p>AEgeans, the Greeks, the Carthaginians and the Romans.</p>
<p>These in turn were discarded for the square rigged vessels of</p>
<p>the Portuguese and the Spaniards. And the latter were driven</p>
<p>from the ocean by the full-rigged craft of the English and the</p>
<p>Dutch.</p>
<p>At present, however, civilisation no longer depends upon</p>
<p>ships. Aircraft has taken and will continue to take the place</p>
<p>of the sailing vessel and the steamer. The next centre of</p>
<p>civilisation will depend upon the development of aircraft and</p>
<p>water power. And the sea once more shall be the undisturbed</p>
<p>home of the little fishes, who once upon a time shared their deep</p>
<p>residence with the earliest ancestors of the human race.</p>
<p>BUDDHA AND CONFUCIUS</p>
<p>CONCERNING BUDDHA AND CONFUCIUS</p>
<p>THE discoveries of the Portuguese and the Spaniards had</p>
<p>brought the Christians of western Europe into close contact</p>
<p>with the people of India and of China. They knew of course</p>
<p>that Christianity was not the only religion on this earth. There</p>
<p>were the Mohammedans and the heathenish tribes of northern</p>
<p>Africa who worshipped sticks and stones and dead trees. But</p>
<p>in India and in China the Christian conquerors found new</p>
<p>millions who had never heard of Christ and who did not want</p>
<p>to hear of Him, because they thought their own religion, which</p>
<p>was thousands of years old, much better than that of the West.</p>
<p>As this is a story of mankind and not an exclusive history of</p>
<p>the people of Europe and our western hemisphere, you ought</p>
<p>to know something of two men whose teaching and whose</p>
<p>example continue to influence the actions and the thoughts</p>
<p>of the majority of our fellow-travellers on this earth.</p>
<p>In India, Buddha was recognised as the great religious</p>
<p>teacher. His history is an interesting one. He was born in</p>
<p>the Sixth Century before the birth of Christ, within sight of the</p>
<p>mighty Himalaya Mountains, where four hundred years before</p>
<p>Zarathustra (or Zoroaster), the first of the great leaders of</p>
<p>the Aryan race (the name which the Eastern branch of the</p>
<p>Indo-European race had given to itself), had taught his people</p>
<p>to regard life as a continuous struggle between Ahriman,</p>
<p>and Ormuzd, the Gods of Evil and Good. Buddha&#x27;s</p>
<p>father was Suddhodana, a mighty chief among the tribe of the</p>
<p>Sakiyas. His mother, Maha Maya, was the daughter of a</p>
<p>neighbouring king. She had been married when she was a very</p>
<p>young girl. But many moons had passed beyond the distant</p>
<p>ridge of hills and still her husband was without an heir who</p>
<p>should rule his lands after him. At last, when she was fifty</p>
<p>years old, her day came and she went forth that she might be</p>
<p>among her own people when her baby should come into this</p>
<p>world.</p>
<p>It was a long trip to the land of the Koliyans, where Maha</p>
<p>Maya had spent her earliest years. One night she was resting</p>
<p>among the cool trees of the garden of Lumbini. There her son</p>
<p>was born. He was given the name of Siddhartha, but we know</p>
<p>him as Buddha, which means the Enlightened One.</p>
<p>In due time, Siddhartha grew up to be a handsome young</p>
<p>prince and when he was nineteen years old, he was married to</p>
<p>his cousin Yasodhara. During the next ten years he lived</p>
<p>far away from all pain and all suffering, behind the protecting</p>
<p>walls of the royal palace, awaiting the day when he should</p>
<p>succeed his father as King of the Sakiyas.</p>
<p>But it happened that when he was thirty years old, he drove</p>
<p>outside of the palace gates and saw a man who was old and</p>
<p>worn out with labour and whose weak limbs could hardly carry</p>
<p>the burden of life. Siddhartha pointed him out to his coachman,</p>
<p>Channa, but Channa answered that there were lots of</p>
<p>poor people in this world and that one more or less did not</p>
<p>matter. The young prince was very sad but he did not say</p>
<p>anything and went back to live with his wife and his father</p>
<p>and his mother and tried to be happy. A little while later he</p>
<p>left the palace a second time. His carriage met a man who</p>
<p>suffered from a terrible disease. Siddhartha asked Channa</p>
<p>what had been the cause of this man&#x27;s suffering, but the coachman</p>
<p>answered that there were many sick people in this world</p>
<p>and that such things could not be helped and did not matter</p>
<p>very much. The young prince was very sad when he heard this</p>
<p>but again he returned to his people.</p>
<p>A few weeks passed. One evening Siddhartha ordered his</p>
<p>carriage in order to go to the river and bathe. Suddenly his</p>
<p>horses were frightened by the sight of a dead man whose rotting</p>
<p>body lay sprawling in the ditch beside the road. The young</p>
<p>prince, who had never been allowed to see such things, was</p>
<p>frightened, but Channa told him not to mind such trifles. The</p>
<p>world was full of dead people. It was the rule of life that all</p>
<p>things must come to an end. Nothing was eternal. The grave</p>
<p>awaited us all and there was no escape.</p>
<p>That evening, when Siddhartha returned to his home, he</p>
<p>was received with music. While he was away his wife had</p>
<p>given birth to a son. The people were delighted because now</p>
<p>they knew that there was an heir to the throne and they</p>
<p>celebrated the event by the beating of many drums. Siddhartha,</p>
<p>however, did not share their joy. The curtain of life had been</p>
<p>lifted and he had learned the horror of man&#x27;s existence. The</p>
<p>sight of death and suffering followed him like a terrible dream.</p>
<p>That night the moon was shining brightly. Siddhartha</p>
<p>woke up and began to think of many things. Never again</p>
<p>could he be happy until he should have found a solution to the</p>
<p>riddle of existence. He decided to find it far away from all</p>
<p>those whom he loved. Softly he went into the room where</p>
<p>Yasodhara was sleeping with her baby. Then he called for</p>
<p>his faithful Channa and told him to follow.</p>
<p>Together the two men went into the darkness of the night,</p>
<p>one to find rest for his soul, the other to be a faithful servant</p>
<p>unto a beloved master.</p>
<p>The people of India among whom Siddhartha wandered for</p>
<p>many years were just then in a state of change. Their ancestors,</p>
<p>the native Indians, had been conquered without great difficulty</p>
<p>by the war-like Aryans (our distant cousins) and thereafter</p>
<p>the Aryans had been the rulers and masters of tens of</p>
<p>millions of docile little brown men. To maintain themselves in</p>
<p>the seat of the mighty, they had divided the population into</p>
<p>different classes and gradually a system of ``caste&#x27;&#x27; of the most</p>
<p>rigid sort had been enforced upon the natives. The descendants</p>
<p>of the Indo-European conquerors belonged to the highest</p>
<p>``caste,&#x27;&#x27; the class of warriors and nobles. Next came the caste</p>
<p>of the priests. Below these followed the peasants and the</p>
<p>business men. The ancient natives, however, who were called</p>
<p>Pariahs, formed a class of despised and miserable slaves and</p>
<p>never could hope to be anything else.</p>
<p>Even the religion of the people was a matter of caste. The</p>
<p>old Indo-Europeans, during their thousands of years of</p>
<p>wandering, had met with many strange adventures. These had</p>
<p>been collected in a book called the Veda. The language of</p>
<p>this book was called Sanskrit, and it was closely related to the</p>
<p>different languages of the European continent, to Greek and</p>
<p>Latin and Russian and German and two-score others. The</p>
<p>three highest castes were allowed to read these holy scriptures.</p>
<p>The Pariah, however, the despised member of the lowest caste,</p>
<p>was not permitted to know its contents. Woe to the man of</p>
<p>noble or priestly caste who should teach a Pariah to study the</p>
<p>sacred volume!</p>
<p>The majority of the Indian people, therefore, lived in</p>
<p>misery. Since this planet offered them very little joy, salvation</p>
<p>from suffering must be found elsewhere. They tried to</p>
<p>derive a little consolation from meditation upon the bliss of</p>
<p>their future existence.</p>
<p>Brahma, the all-creator who was regarded by the Indian</p>
<p>people as the supreme ruler of life and death, was worshipped</p>
<p>as the highest ideal of perfection. To become like Brahma, to</p>
<p>lose all desires for riches and power, was recognised as the most</p>
<p>exalted purpose of existence. Holy thoughts were regarded</p>
<p>as more important than holy deeds, and many people went</p>
<p>into the desert and lived upon the leaves of trees and starved</p>
<p>their bodies that they might feed their souls with the glorious</p>
<p>contemplation of the splendours of Brahma, the Wise, the</p>
<p>Good and the Merciful.</p>
<p>Siddhartha, who had often observed these solitary wanderers</p>
<p>who were seeking the truth far away from the turmoil</p>
<p>of the cities and the villages, decided to follow their example.</p>
<p>He cut his hair. He took his pearls and his rubies and sent</p>
<p>them back to his family with a message of farewell, which the</p>
<p>ever faithful Channa carried. Without a single follower, the</p>
<p>young prince then moved into the wilderness.</p>
<p>Soon the fame of his holy conduct spread among the mountains.</p>
<p>Five young men came to him and asked that they might</p>
<p>be allowed to listen to his words of wisdom. He agreed to be</p>
<p>their master if they would follow him. They consented, and</p>
<p>he took them into the hills and for six years he taught them</p>
<p>all he knew amidst the lonely peaks of the Vindhya Mountains.</p>
<p>But at the end of this period of study, he felt that he was still</p>
<p>far from perfection. The world that he had left continued to</p>
<p>tempt him. He now asked that his pupils leave him and then</p>
<p>he fasted for forty-nine days and nights, sitting upon the roots</p>
<p>of an old tree. At last he received his reward. In the dusk of</p>
<p>the fiftieth evening, Brahma revealed himself to his faithful</p>
<p>servant. From that moment on, Siddhartha was called Buddha</p>
<p>and he was revered as the Enlightened One who had come to</p>
<p>save men from their unhappy mortal fate.</p>
<p>The last forty-five years of his life, Buddha spent within</p>
<p>the valley of the Ganges River, teaching his simple lesson of</p>
<p>submission and meekness unto all men. In the year 488 before</p>
<p>our era, he died, full of years and beloved by millions of people.</p>
<p>He had not preached his doctrines for the benefit of a single</p>
<p>class. Even the lowest Pariah might call himself his disciple.</p>
<p>This, however, did not please the nobles and the priests and</p>
<p>the merchants who did their best to destroy a creed which recognised</p>
<p>the equality of all living creatures and offered men the</p>
<p>hope of a second life (a reincarnation) under happier circumstances.</p>
<p>As soon as they could, they encouraged the people of</p>
<p>India to return to the ancient doctrines of the Brahmin creed</p>
<p>with its fasting and its tortures of the sinful body. But</p>
<p>Buddhism could not be destroyed. Slowly the disciples of the</p>
<p>Enlightened One wandered across the valleys of the Himalayas,</p>
<p>and moved into China. They crossed the Yellow Sea</p>
<p>and preached the wisdom of their master unto the people of</p>
<p>Japan, and they faithfully obeyed the will of their great master,</p>
<p>who had forbidden them to use force. To-day more people</p>
<p>recognise Buddha as their teacher than ever before and their</p>
<p>number surpasses that of the combined followers of Christ and Mohammed.</p>
<p>As for Confucius, the wise old man of the Chinese, his</p>
<p>story is a simple one. He was born in the year 550 B.C. He</p>
<p>led a quiet, dignified and uneventful life at a time when China</p>
<p>was without a strong central government and when the Chinese</p>
<p>people were at the mercy of bandits and robber-barons who</p>
<p>went from city to city, pillaging and stealing and murdering</p>
<p>and turning the busy plains of northern and central China into</p>
<p>a wilderness of starving people.</p>
<p>Confucius, who loved his people, tried to save them. He</p>
<p>did not have much faith in the use of violence. He was a very</p>
<p>peaceful person. He did not think that he could make people</p>
<p>over by giving them a lot of new laws. He knew that the only</p>
<p>possible salvation would come from a change of heart, and he</p>
<p>set out upon the seemingly hopeless task of changing the character</p>
<p>of his millions of fellow men who inhabited the wide plains</p>
<p>of eastern Asia. The Chinese had never been much interested</p>
<p>in religion as we understand that word. They believed in</p>
<p>devils and spooks as most primitive people do. But they had</p>
<p>no prophets and recognised no ``revealed truth.&#x27;&#x27; Confucius</p>
<p>is almost the only one among the great moral leaders who did</p>
<p>not see visions, who did not proclaim himself as the messenger</p>
<p>of a divine power; who did not, at some time or another, claim</p>
<p>that he was inspired by voices from above.</p>
<p>He was just a very sensible and kindly man, rather given</p>
<p>to lonely wanderings and melancholy tunes upon his faithful</p>
<p>flute. He asked for no recognition. He did not demand that</p>
<p>any one should follow him or worship him. He reminds us</p>
<p>of the ancient Greek philosophers, especially those of the Stoic</p>
<p>School, men who believed in right living and righteous thinking</p>
<p>without the hope of a reward but simply for the peace of</p>
<p>the soul that comes with a good conscience.</p>
<p>Confucius was a very tolerant man. He went out of his</p>
<p>way to visit Lao-Tse, the other great Chinese leader and the</p>
<p>founder of a philosophic system called ``Taoism,&#x27;&#x27; which was</p>
<p>merely an early Chinese version of the Golden Rule.</p>
<p>Confucius bore no hatred to any one. He taught the virtue</p>
<p>of supreme self-possession. A person of real worth, according</p>
<p>to the teaching of Confucius, did not allow himself to be</p>
<p>ruffled by anger and suffered whatever fate brought him with</p>
<p>the resignation of those sages who understand that everything</p>
<p>which happens, in one way or another, is meant for the best.</p>
<p>At first he had only a few students. Gradually the number</p>
<p>increased. Before his death, in the year 478 B.C., several of the</p>
<p>kings and the princes of China confessed themselves his disciples.</p>
<p>When Christ was born in Bethlehem, the philosophy of</p>
<p>Confucius had already become a part of the mental make-up</p>
<p>of most Chinamen. It has continued to influence their lives</p>
<p>ever since. Not however in its pure, original form. Most religions</p>
<p>change as time goes on. Christ preached humility and</p>
<p>meekness and absence from worldly ambitions, but fifteen</p>
<p>centuries after Golgotha, the head of the Christian church was</p>
<p>spending millions upon the erection of a building that bore</p>
<p>little relation to the lonely stable of Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Lao-Tse taught the Golden Rule, and in less than three</p>
<p>centuries the ignorant masses had made him into a real and</p>
<p>very cruel God and had buried his wise commandments under</p>
<p>a rubbish-heap of superstition which made the lives of the average</p>
<p>Chinese one long series of frights and fears and horrors.</p>
<p>Confucius had shown his students the beauties of honouring</p>
<p>their Father and their Mother. They soon began to be more</p>
<p>interested in the memory of their departed parents than in the</p>
<p>happiness of their children and their grandchildren. Deliberately</p>
<p>they turned their backs upon the future and tried to</p>
<p>peer into the vast darkness of the past. The worship of the</p>
<p>ancestors became a positive religious system. Rather than</p>
<p>disturb a cemetery situated upon the sunny and fertile side of</p>
<p>a mountain, they would plant their rice and wheat upon the</p>
<p>barren rocks of the other slope where nothing could possibly</p>
<p>grow. And they preferred hunger and famine to the desecration</p>
<p>of the ancestral grave.</p>
<p>At the same time the wise words of Confucius never quite</p>
<p>lost their hold upon the increasing millions of eastern Asia.</p>
<p>Confucianism, with its profound sayings and shrewd observations,</p>
<p>added a touch of common-sense philosophy to the soul of</p>
<p>every Chinaman and influenced his entire life, whether he was</p>
<p>a simple laundry man in a steaming basement or the ruler of vast</p>
<p>provinces who dwelt behind the high walls of a secluded palace.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century the enthusiastic but rather uncivilised</p>
<p>Christians of the western world came face to face with</p>
<p>the older creeds of the East. The early Spaniards and Portuguese</p>
<p>looked upon the peaceful statues of Buddha and contemplated</p>
<p>the venerable pictures of Confucius and did not in</p>
<p>the least know what to make of those worthy prophets with</p>
<p>their far-away smile. They came to the easy conclusion that</p>
<p>these strange divinities were just plain devils who represented</p>
<p>something idolatrous and heretical and did not deserve the</p>
<p>respect of the true sons of the Church. Whenever the spirit</p>
<p>of Buddha or Confucius seemed to interfere with the trade in</p>
<p>spices and silks, the Europeans attacked the ``evil influence&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>with bullets and grape-shot. That system had certain very</p>
<p>definite disadvantages. It has left us an unpleasant heritage</p>
<p>of ill-will which promises little good for the immediate future.</p>
<p>THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>THE PROGRESS OF THE HUMAN RACE IS BEST</p>
<p>COMPARED TO A GIGANTIC PENDULUM</p>
<p>WHICH FOREVER SWINGS FORWARD AND</p>
<p>BACKWARD. THE RELIGIOUS INDIFFERENCE</p>
<p>AND THE ARTISTIC AND LITERARY</p>
<p>ENTHUSIASM OF THE RENAISSANCE</p>
<p>WERE FOLLOWED BY THE ARTISTIC AND</p>
<p>LITERARY INDIFFERENCE AND THE RELIGIOUS</p>
<p>ENTHUSIASM OF THE REFORMATION</p>
<p>OF course you have heard of the Reformation. You think</p>
<p>of a small but courageous group of pilgrims who crossed the</p>
<p>ocean to have ``freedom of religious worship.&#x27;&#x27; Vaguely in the</p>
<p>course of time (and more especially in our Protestant countries)</p>
<p>the Reformation has come to stand for the idea of</p>
<p>``liberty of thought.&#x27;&#x27; Martin Luther is represented as the</p>
<p>leader of the vanguard of progress. But when history is</p>
<p>something more than a series of flattering speeches addressed</p>
<p>to our own glorious ancestors, when to use the words of the</p>
<p>German historian Ranke, we try to discover what ``actually</p>
<p>happened,&#x27;&#x27; then much of the past is seen in a very different</p>
<p>light.</p>
<p>Few things in human life are either entirely good or entirely</p>
<p>bad. Few things are either black or white. It is the duty of</p>
<p>the honest chronicler to give a true account of all the good and</p>
<p>bad sides of every historical event. It is very difficult to do</p>
<p>this because we all have our personal likes and dislikes. But</p>
<p>we ought to try and be as fair as we can be, and must not allow</p>
<p>our prejudices to influence us too much.</p>
<p>Take my own case as an example. I grew up in the very</p>
<p>Protestant centre of a very Protestant country. I never saw</p>
<p>any Catholics until I was about twelve years old. Then I felt</p>
<p>very uncomfortable when I met them. I was a little bit afraid.</p>
<p>I knew the story of the many thousand people who had been</p>
<p>burned and hanged and quartered by the Spanish Inquisition</p>
<p>when the Duke of Alba tried to cure the Dutch people of their</p>
<p>Lutheran and Calvinistic heresies. All that was very real</p>
<p>to me. It seemed to have happened only the day before. It</p>
<p>might occur again. There might be another Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s</p>
<p>night, and poor little me would be slaughtered in my</p>
<p>nightie and my body would be thrown out of the window, as</p>
<p>had happened to the noble Admiral de Coligny.</p>
<p>Much later I went to live for a number of years in a Catholic</p>
<p>country. I found the people much pleasanter and much</p>
<p>more tolerant and quite as intelligent as my former countrymen.</p>
<p>To my great surprise, I began to discover that there</p>
<p>was a Catholic side to the Reformation, quite as much as a</p>
<p>Protestant.</p>
<p>Of course the good people of the sixteenth and seventeenth</p>
<p>centuries, who actually lived through the Reformation, did</p>
<p>not see things that way. They were always right and their</p>
<p>enemy was always wrong. It was a question of hang or be</p>
<p>hanged, and both sides preferred to do the hanging. Which</p>
<p>was no more than human and for which they deserve no blame.</p>
<p>When we look at the world as it appeared in the year 1500,</p>
<p>an easy date to remember, and the year in which the Emperor</p>
<p>Charles V was born, this is what we see. The feudal disorder</p>
<p>of the Middle Ages has given way before the order of a number</p>
<p>of highly centralised kingdoms. The most powerful of</p>
<p>all sovereigns is the great Charles, then a baby in a cradle.</p>
<p>He is the grandson of Ferdinand and Isabella and of Maxi-</p>
<p>milian of Habsburg, the last of the mediaeval knights, and of</p>
<p>his wife Mary, the daughter of Charles the Bold, the ambitious</p>
<p>Burgundian duke who had made successful war upon France</p>
<p>but had been killed by the independent Swiss peasants. The</p>
<p>child Charles, therefore, has fallen heir to the greater part of</p>
<p>the map, to all the lands of his parents, grandparents, uncles,</p>
<p>cousins and aunts in Germany, in Austria, in Holland, in</p>
<p>Belgium, in Italy, and in Spain, together with all their colonies</p>
<p>in Asia, Africa and America. By a strange irony of fate, he</p>
<p>has been born in Ghent, in that same castle of the counts of</p>
<p>Flanders, which the Germans used as a prison during their</p>
<p>recent occupation of Belgium, and although a Spanish king</p>
<p>and a German emperor, he receives the training of a Fleming.</p>
<p>As his father is dead (poisoned, so people say, but this is</p>
<p>never proved), and his mother has lost her mind (she is travelling</p>
<p>through her domains with the coffin containing the body</p>
<p>of her departed husband), the child is left to the strict</p>
<p>discipline of his Aunt Margaret. Forced to rule Germans and</p>
<p>Italians and Spaniards and a hundred strange races, Charles</p>
<p>grows up a Fleming, a faithful son of the Catholic Church,</p>
<p>but quite averse to religious intolerance. He is rather lazy,</p>
<p>both as a boy and as a man. But fate condemns him to rule</p>
<p>the world when the world is in a turmoil of religious fervour.</p>
<p>Forever he is speeding from Madrid to Innsbruck and from</p>
<p>Bruges to Vienna. He loves peace and quiet and he is always</p>
<p>at war. At the age of fifty-five, we see him turn his back upon</p>
<p>the human race in utter disgust at so much hate and so much</p>
<p>stupidity. Three years later he dies, a very tired and disappointed</p>
<p>man.</p>
<p>So much for Charles the Emperor. How about the Church,</p>
<p>the second great power in the world? The Church has changed</p>
<p>greatly since the early days of the Middle Ages, when it started</p>
<p>out to conquer the heathen and show them the advantages of</p>
<p>a pious and righteous life. In the first place, the Church has</p>
<p>grown too rich. The Pope is no longer the shepherd of a flock</p>
<p>of humble Christians. He lives in a vast palace and surrounds</p>
<p>himself with artists and musicians and famous literary men.</p>
<p>His churches and chapels are covered with new pictures in</p>
<p>which the saints look more like Greek Gods than is strictly</p>
<p>necessary. He divides his time unevenly between affairs of</p>
<p>state and art. The affairs of state take ten percent of his time.</p>
<p>The other ninety percent goes to an active interest in Roman</p>
<p>statues, recently discovered Greek vases, plans for a new summer</p>
<p>home, the rehearsal of a new play. The Archbishops and</p>
<p>the Cardinals follow the example of their Pope. The Bishops</p>
<p>try to imitate the Archbishops. The village priests, however,</p>
<p>have remained faithful to their duties. They keep themselves</p>
<p>aloof from the wicked world and the heathenish love of beauty</p>
<p>and pleasure. They stay away from the monasteries where</p>
<p>the monks seem to have forgotten their ancient vows of simplicity</p>
<p>and poverty and live as happily as they dare without</p>
<p>causing too much of a public scandal.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the common people. They are much</p>
<p>better off than they have ever been before. They are more</p>
<p>prosperous, they live in better houses, their children go to better</p>
<p>schools, their cities are more beautiful than before, their</p>
<p>firearms have made them the equal of their old enemies, the</p>
<p>robber-barons, who for centuries have levied such heavy taxes</p>
<p>upon their trade. So much for the chief actors in the</p>
<p>Reformation.</p>
<p>Now let us see what the Renaissance has done to Europe,</p>
<p>and then you will understand how the revival of learning and</p>
<p>art was bound to be followed by a revival of religious interests.</p>
<p>The Renaissance began in Italy. From there it spread</p>
<p>to France. It was not quite successful in Spain, where</p>
<p>five hundred years of warfare with the Moors had made the</p>
<p>people very narrow minded and very fanatical in all religious</p>
<p>matters. The circle had grown wider and wider, but once the</p>
<p>Alps had been crossed, the Renaissance had suffered a change.</p>
<p>The people of northern Europe, living in a very different</p>
<p>climate, had an outlook upon life which contrasted strangely</p>
<p>with that of their southern neighbours. The Italians lived out</p>
<p>in the open, under a sunny sky. It was easy for them to laugh</p>
<p>and to sing and to be happy. The Germans, the Dutch, the</p>
<p>English, the Swedes, spent most of their time indoors, listening</p>
<p>to the rain beating on the closed windows of their comfortable</p>
<p>little houses. They did not laugh quite so much. They</p>
<p>took everything more seriously. They were forever conscious</p>
<p>of their immortal souls and they did not like to be funny about</p>
<p>matters which they considered holy and sacred. The ``humanistic&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>part of the Renaissance, the books, the studies of ancient</p>
<p>authors, the grammar and the text-books, interested them</p>
<p>greatly. But the general return to the old pagan civilisation</p>
<p>of Greece and Rome, which was one of the chief results of the</p>
<p>Renaissance in Italy, filled their hearts with horror.</p>
<p>But the Papacy and the College of Cardinals was almost</p>
<p>entirely composed of Italians and they had turned the Church</p>
<p>into a pleasant club where people discussed art and music and</p>
<p>the theatre, but rarely mentioned religion. Hence the split</p>
<p>between the serious north and the more civilised but easy-going</p>
<p>and indifferent south was growing wider and wider all the</p>
<p>time and nobody seemed to be aware of the danger that threatened</p>
<p>the Church.</p>
<p>There were a few minor reasons which will explain why the</p>
<p>Reformation took place in Germany rather than in Sweden</p>
<p>or England. The Germans bore an ancient grudge against</p>
<p>Rome. The endless quarrels between Emperor and Pope had</p>
<p>caused much mutual bitterness. In the other European countries</p>
<p>where the government rested in the hands of a strong</p>
<p>king, the ruler had often been able to protect his subjects</p>
<p>against the greed of the priests. In Germany, where a shadowy</p>
<p>emperor ruled a turbulent crowd of little princelings, the good</p>
<p>burghers were more directly at the mercy of their bishops and</p>
<p>prelates. These dignitaries were trying to collect large sums</p>
<p>of money for the benefit of those enormous churches which</p>
<p>were a hobby of the Popes of the Renaissance. The Germans</p>
<p>felt that they were being mulcted and quite naturally they did</p>
<p>not like it.</p>
<p>And then there is the rarely mentioned fact that Germany</p>
<p>was the home of the printing press. In northern Europe books</p>
<p>were cheap and the Bible was no longer a mysterious manu-</p>
<p>script owned and explained by the priest. It was a household</p>
<p>book of many families where Latin was understood by the</p>
<p>father and by the children. Whole families began to read it,</p>
<p>which was against the law of the Church. They discovered that</p>
<p>the priests were telling them many things which, according to</p>
<p>the original text of the Holy Scriptures, were somewhat different.</p>
<p>This caused doubt. People began to ask questions. And</p>
<p>questions, when they cannot be answered, often cause a great</p>
<p>deal of trouble.</p>
<p>The attack began when the humanists of the North opened</p>
<p>fire upon the monks. In their heart of hearts they still had</p>
<p>too much respect and reverence for the Pope to direct their</p>
<p>sallies against his Most Holy Person. But the lazy, ignorant</p>
<p>monks, living behind the sheltering walls of their rich monasteries,</p>
<p>offered rare sport.</p>
<p>The leader in this warfare, curiously enough, was a very</p>
<p>faithful son of the church Gerard Gerardzoon, or Desiderius</p>
<p>Erasmus, as he is usually called, was a poor boy, born in</p>
<p>Rotterdam in Holland, and educated at the same Latin school</p>
<p>of Deventer from which Thomas a Kempis had graduated.</p>
<p>He had become a priest and for a time he had lived in a monastery.</p>
<p>He had travelled a great deal and knew whereof he wrote,</p>
<p>When he began his career as a public pamphleteer (he would</p>
<p>have been called an editorial writer in our day) the world was</p>
<p>greatly amused at an anonymous series of letters which had</p>
<p>just appeared under the title of ``Letters of Obscure Men.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>In these letters, the general stupidity and arrogance of the</p>
<p>monks of the late Middle Ages was exposed in a strange</p>
<p>German-Latin doggerel which reminds one of our modern</p>
<p>limericks. Erasmus himself was a very learned and serious</p>
<p>scholar, who knew both Latin and Greek and gave us the first</p>
<p>reliable version of the New Testament, which he translated</p>
<p>into Latin together with a corrected edition of the original</p>
<p>Greek text. But he believed with Sallust, the Roman poet,</p>
<p>that nothing prevents us from ``stating the truth with a smile</p>
<p>upon our lips.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>In the year 1500, while visiting Sir Thomas More in Eng-</p>
<p>land, he took a few weeks off and wrote a funny little book,</p>
<p>called the ``Praise of Folly,&#x27;&#x27; in which he attacked the monks</p>
<p>and their credulous followers with that most dangerous of all</p>
<p>weapons, humor. The booklet was the best seller of the sixteenth</p>
<p>century. It was translated into almost every language</p>
<p>and it made people pay attention to those other books of</p>
<p>Erasmus in which he advocated reform of the many abuses of</p>
<p>the church and appealed to his fellow humanists to help him</p>
<p>in his task of bringing about a great rebirth of the Christian</p>
<p>faith.</p>
<p>But nothing came of these excellent plans. Erasmus was</p>
<p>too reasonable and too tolerant to please most of the enemies</p>
<p>of the church. They were waiting for a leader of a more</p>
<p>robust nature.</p>
<p>He came, and his name was Martin Luther.</p>
<p>Luther was a North-German peasant with a first-class</p>
<p>brain and possessed of great personal courage. He was a</p>
<p>university man, a master of arts of the University of Erfurt;</p>
<p>afterwards he joined a Dominican monastery. Then he became</p>
<p>a college professor at the theological school of Wittenberg</p>
<p>and began to explain the scriptures to the indifferent ploughboys</p>
<p>of his Saxon home. He had a lot of spare time and this he used</p>
<p>to study the original texts of the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p>Soon he began to see the great difference which existed between</p>
<p>the words of Christ and those that were preached by the Popes and the Bishops.</p>
<p>In the year 1511, he visited Rome on official business.</p>
<p>Alexander VI, of the family of Borgia, who had enriched himself</p>
<p>for the benefit of his son and daughter, was dead. But his</p>
<p>successor, Julius II, a man of irreproachable personal character,</p>
<p>was spending most of his time fighting and building and</p>
<p>did not impress this serious minded German theologian with</p>
<p>his piety. Luther returned to Wittenberg a much disappointed</p>
<p>man. But worse was to follow.</p>
<p>The gigantic church of St. Peter which Pope Julius had</p>
<p>wished upon his innocent successors, although only half begun,</p>
<p>was already in need of repair. Alexander VI had spent every</p>
<p>penny of the Papal treasury. Leo X, who succeeded Julius</p>
<p>in the year 1513, was on the verge of bankruptcy. He reverted</p>
<p>to an old method of raising ready cash. He began to sell</p>
<p>``indulgences.&#x27;&#x27; An indulgence was a piece of parchment which</p>
<p>in return for a certain sum of money, promised a sinner a decrease</p>
<p>of the time which he would have to spend in purgatory.</p>
<p>It was a perfectly correct thing according to the creed of the</p>
<p>late Middle Ages. Since the church had the power to forgive</p>
<p>the sins of those who truly repented before they died, the</p>
<p>church also had the right to shorten, through its intercession</p>
<p>with the Saints, the time during which the soul must be punfied</p>
<p>in the shadowy realms of Purgatory.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that these Indulgences must be sold for</p>
<p>money. But they offered an easy form of revenue and besides,</p>
<p>those who were too poor to pay, received theirs for nothing.</p>
<p>Now it happened in the year 1517 that the exclusive territory</p>
<p>for the sale of indulgences in Saxony was given to a</p>
<p>Dominican monk by the name of Johan Tetzel. Brother</p>
<p>Johan was a hustling salesman. To tell the truth he was a</p>
<p>little too eager. His business methods outraged the pious</p>
<p>people of the little duchy. And Luther, who was an honest</p>
<p>fellow, got so angry that he did a rash thing. On the 31st of</p>
<p>October of the year 1517, he went to the court church and upon</p>
<p>the doors thereof he posted a sheet of paper with ninety-five</p>
<p>statements (or theses), attacking the sale of indulgences.</p>
<p>These statements had been written in Latin. Luther had no</p>
<p>intention of starting a riot. He was not a revolutionist. He</p>
<p>objected to the institution of the Indulgences and he wanted his</p>
<p>fellow professors to know what he thought about them. But</p>
<p>this was still a private affair of the clerical and professorial</p>
<p>world and there was no appeal to the prejudices of the community</p>
<p>of laymen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at that moment when the whole world had</p>
<p>begun to take an interest in the religious affairs of the day</p>
<p>it was utterly impossible to discuss anything, without at once</p>
<p>creating a serious mental disturbance. In less than two</p>
<p>months, all Europe was discussing the ninety-five theses of</p>
<p>the Saxon monk. Every one must take sides. Every obscure</p>
<p>little theologian must print his own opinion. The papal</p>
<p>authorities began to be alarmed. They ordered the Wittenberg</p>
<p>professor to proceed to Rome and give an account of his action.</p>
<p>Luther wisely remembered what had happened to Huss. He</p>
<p>stayed in Germany and he was punished with excommunication.</p>
<p>Luther burned the papal bull in the presence of an</p>
<p>admiring multitude and from that moment, peace between himself</p>
<p>and the Pope was no longer possible.</p>
<p>Without any desire on his part, Luther had become the</p>
<p>leader of a vast army of discontented Christians. German</p>
<p>patriots like Ulrich von Hutten, rushed to his defence. The</p>
<p>students of Wittenberg and Erfurt and Leipzig offered to</p>
<p>defend him should the authorities try to imprison him. The</p>
<p>Elector of Saxony reassured the eager young men. No harm</p>
<p>would befall Luther as long as he stayed on Saxon ground.</p>
<p>All this happened in the year 1520. Charles V was twenty</p>
<p>years old and as the ruler of half the world, was forced to</p>
<p>remain on pleasant terms with the Pope. He sent out calls</p>
<p>for a Diet or general assembly in the good city of Worms on</p>
<p>the Rhine and commanded Luther to be present and give an</p>
<p>account of his extraordinary behaviour. Luther, who now</p>
<p>was the national hero of the Germans, went. He refused to</p>
<p>take back a single word of what he had ever written or said.</p>
<p>His conscience was controlled only by the word of God. He</p>
<p>would live and die for his conscience</p>
<p>The Diet of Worms, after due deliberation, declared</p>
<p>Luther an outlaw before God and man, and forbade all Germans</p>
<p>to give him shelter or food or drink, or to read a single</p>
<p>word of the books which the dastardly heretic had written.</p>
<p>But the great reformer was in no danger. By the majority</p>
<p>of the Germans of the north the edict was denounced as a most</p>
<p>unjust and outrageous document. For greater safety, Luther</p>
<p>was hidden in the Wartburg, a castle belonging to the Elector</p>
<p>of Saxony, and there he defied all papal authority by translating</p>
<p>the entire Bible into the German language, that all the</p>
<p>people might read and know the word of God for themselves.</p>
<p>By this time, the Reformation was no longer a spiritual</p>
<p>and religious affair. Those who hated the beauty of the modern</p>
<p>church building used this period of unrest to attack and</p>
<p>destroy what they did not like because they did not understand</p>
<p>it. Impoverished knights tried to make up for past losses by</p>
<p>grabbing the territory which belonged to the monasteries.</p>
<p>Discontented princes made use of the absence of the Emperor</p>
<p>to increase their own power. The starving peasants, following</p>
<p>the leadership of half-crazy agitators, made the best of</p>
<p>the opportunity and attacked the castles of their masters and</p>
<p>plundered and murdered and burned with the zeal of the old</p>
<p>Crusaders.</p>
<p>A veritable reign of disorder broke loose throughout the</p>
<p>Empire. Some princes became Protestants (as the ``protesting&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>adherents of Luther were called) and persecuted their</p>
<p>Catholic subjects. Others remained Catholic and hanged their</p>
<p>Protestant subjects. The Diet of Speyer of the year 1526</p>
<p>tried to settle this difficult question of allegiance by ordering</p>
<p>that ``the subjects should all be of the same religious denomination</p>
<p>as their princes.&#x27;&#x27; This turned Germany into a checkerboard</p>
<p>of a thousand hostile little duchies and principalities and</p>
<p>created a situation which prevented the normal political</p>
<p>growth for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>In February of the year 1546 Luther died and was put</p>
<p>to rest in the same church where twenty-nine years before he</p>
<p>had proclaimed his famous objections to the sale of Indulgences.</p>
<p>In less than thirty years, the indifferent, joking and</p>
<p>laughing world of the Renaissance had been transformed into</p>
<p>the arguing, quarrelling, back-biting, debating-society of the</p>
<p>Reformation. The universal spiritual empire of the Popes</p>
<p>came to a sudden end and the whole Western Europe was</p>
<p>turned into a battle-field, where Protestants and Catholics</p>
<p>killed each other for the greater glory of certain theological</p>
<p>doctrines which are as incomprehensible to the present generation</p>
<p>as the mysterious inscriptions of the ancient Etruscans.</p>
<p>RELIGIOUS WARFARE</p>
<p>THE AGE OF THE GREAT RELIGIOUS</p>
<p>CONTROVERSIES</p>
<p>THE sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were the age of</p>
<p>religious controversy.</p>
<p>If you will notice you will find that almost everybody</p>
<p>around you is forever ``talking economics&#x27;&#x27; and discussing</p>
<p>wages and hours of labor and strikes in their relation to the</p>
<p>life of the community, for that is the main topic of interest</p>
<p>of our own time.</p>
<p>The poor little children of the year 1600 or 1650 fared</p>
<p>worse. They never heard anything but ``religion.&#x27;&#x27; Their</p>
<p>heads were filled with <code>predestination,&#x27;&#x27; </code>transubstantition,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>``free will,&#x27;&#x27; and a hundred other queer words, expressing</p>
<p>obscure points of ``the true faith,&#x27;&#x27; whether Catholic or</p>
<p>Protestant. According to the desire of their parents they were</p>
<p>baptised Catholics or Lutherans or Calvinists or Zwinglians</p>
<p>or Anabaptists. They learned their theology from the Augsburg</p>
<p>catechism, composed by Luther, or from the ``institutes</p>
<p>of Christianity,&#x27;&#x27; written by Calvin, or they mumbled the</p>
<p>Thirty-Nine Articles of Faith which were printed in the English</p>
<p>Book of Common Prayer, and they were told that these</p>
<p>alone represented the ``True Faith.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>They heard of the wholesale theft of church property</p>
<p>perpetrated by King Henry VIII, the much-married monarch of</p>
<p>England, who made himself the supreme head of the English</p>
<p>church, and assumed the old papal rights of appointing bishops</p>
<p>and priests. They had a nightmare whenever some one</p>
<p>mentioned the Holy Inquisition, with its dungeons and its</p>
<p>many torture chambers, and they were treated to equally horrible</p>
<p>stories of how a mob of outraged Dutch Protestants had</p>
<p>got hold of a dozen defenceless old priests and hanged them</p>
<p>for the sheer pleasure of killing those who professed</p>
<p>a different faith. It was unfortunate that the two</p>
<p>contending parties were so equally matched. Otherwise</p>
<p>the struggle would have come to a quick solution.</p>
<p>Now it dragged on for eight generations, and</p>
<p>it grew so complicated that I can only tell you the most</p>
<p>important details, and must ask you to get the</p>
<p>rest from one of the many histories of the Reformation.</p>
<p>The great reform movement of the Protestants</p>
<p>had been followed by a thoroughgoing reform</p>
<p>within the bosom of the Church. Those popes who</p>
<p>had been merely amateur humanists and dealers in Roman</p>
<p>and Greek antiquities, disappeared from the scene and</p>
<p>their place was taken by serious men who spent twenty hours</p>
<p>a day administering those holy duties which had been placed</p>
<p>in their hands.</p>
<p>The long and rather disgraceful happiness of the monasteries</p>
<p>came to an end. Monks and nuns were forced to be up</p>
<p>at sunrise, to study the Church Fathers, to tend the sick and</p>
<p>console the dying. The Holy Inquisition watched day and</p>
<p>night that no dangerous doctrines should be spread by way of</p>
<p>the printing press. Here it is customary to mention poor</p>
<p>Galileo, who was locked up because he had been a little too</p>
<p>indiscreet in explaining the heavens with his funny little</p>
<p>telescope and had muttered certain opinions about the behaviour</p>
<p>of the planets which were entirely opposed to the official views</p>
<p>of the church. But in all fairness to the Pope, the clergy and</p>
<p>the Inquisition, it ought to be stated that the Protestants were</p>
<p>quite as much the enemies of science and medicine as the Catholics</p>
<p>and with equal manifestations of ignorance and intolerance</p>
<p>regarded the men who investigated things for themselves</p>
<p>as the most dangerous enemies of mankind.</p>
<p>And Calvin, the great French reformer and the tyrant</p>
<p>(both political and spiritual) of Geneva, not only assisted the</p>
<p>French authorities when they tried to hang Michael Servetus</p>
<p>(the Spanish theologian and physician who had become famous</p>
<p>as the assistant of Vesalius, the first great anatomist), but</p>
<p>when Servetus had managed to escape from his French jail and</p>
<p>had fled to Geneva, Calvin threw this brilliant man into prison</p>
<p>and after a prolonged trial, allowed him to be burned at the</p>
<p>stake on account of his heresies, totally indifferent to his fame</p>
<p>as a scientist.</p>
<p>And so it went. We have few reliable statistics upon the</p>
<p>subject, but on the whole, the Protestants tired of this game</p>
<p>long before the Catholics, and the greater part of honest men</p>
<p>and women who were burned and hanged and decapitated on</p>
<p>account of their religious beliefs fell as victims of the very</p>
<p>energetic but also very drastic church of Rome.</p>
<p>For tolerance (and please remember this when you grow</p>
<p>older), is of very recent origin and even the people of our own</p>
<p>so-called ``modern world&#x27;&#x27; are apt to be tolerant only upon such</p>
<p>matters as do not interest them very much. They are tolerant</p>
<p>towards a native of Africa, and do not care whether he becomes</p>
<p>a Buddhist or a Mohammedan, because neither Buddhism nor</p>
<p>Mohammedanism means anything to them. But when they</p>
<p>hear that their neighbour who was a Republican and believed</p>
<p>in a high protective tariff, has joined the Socialist party and</p>
<p>now wants to repeal all tariff laws, their tolerance ceases and</p>
<p>they use almost the same words as those employed by a kindly</p>
<p>Catholic (or Protestant) of the seventeenth century, who was</p>
<p>informed that his best friend whom he had always respected</p>
<p>and loved had fallen a victim to the terrible heresies of the</p>
<p>Protestant (or Catholic) church.</p>
<p>``Heresy&#x27;&#x27; until a very short time ago was regarded as a</p>
<p>disease. Nowadays when we see a man neglecting the personal</p>
<p>cleanliness of his body and his home and exposing himself</p>
<p>and his children to the dangers of typhoid fever or another</p>
<p>preventable disease, we send for the board-of-health and the</p>
<p>health officer calls upon the police to aid him in removing this</p>
<p>person who is a danger to the safety of the entire community.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a heretic, a man</p>
<p>or a woman who openly doubted the fundamental principles</p>
<p>upon which his Protestant or Catholic religion had been</p>
<p>founded, was considered a more terrible menace than a typhoid</p>
<p>carrier. Typhoid fever might (very likely would) destroy the</p>
<p>body. But heresy, according to them, would positively destroy</p>
<p>the immortal soul. It was therefore the duty of all good and</p>
<p>logical citizens to warn the police against the enemies of the</p>
<p>established order of things and those who failed to do so were</p>
<p>as culpable as a modern man who does not telephone to the</p>
<p>nearest doctor when he discovers that his fellow-tenants are</p>
<p>suffering from cholera or small-pox.</p>
<p>In the years to come you will hear a great deal about</p>
<p>preventive medicine. Preventive medicine simply means that our</p>
<p>doctors do not wait until their patients are sick, then step</p>
<p>forward and cure them. On the contrary, they study the patient</p>
<p>and the conditions under which he lives when he (the patient)</p>
<p>is perfectly well and they remove every possible cause of illness</p>
<p>by cleaning up rubbish, by teaching him what to eat and what</p>
<p>to avoid, and by giving him a few simple ideas of personal</p>
<p>hygiene. They go even further than that, and these good</p>
<p>doctors enter the schools and teach the children how to use</p>
<p>tooth-brushes and how to avoid catching colds.</p>
<p>The sixteenth century which regarded (as I have tried to</p>
<p>show you) bodily illness as much less important than sickness</p>
<p>which threatened the soul, organised a system of spiritual</p>
<p>preventive medicine. As soon as a child was old enough to spell</p>
<p>his first words, he was educated in the true (and the ``only</p>
<p>true&#x27;&#x27;) principles of the Faith. Indirectly this proved to be a</p>
<p>good thing for the general progress of the people of Europe.</p>
<p>The Protestant lands were soon dotted with schools. They</p>
<p>used a great deal of very valuable time to explain the Catechism,</p>
<p>but they gave instruction in other things besides theology.</p>
<p>They encouraged reading and they were responsible</p>
<p>for the great prosperity of the printing trade.</p>
<p>But the Catholics did not lag behind. They too devoted</p>
<p>much time and thought to education. The Church, in this matter,</p>
<p>found an invaluable friend and ally in the newly-founded</p>
<p>order of the Society of Jesus. The founder of this remarkable</p>
<p>organisation was a Spanish soldier who after a life of unholy</p>
<p>adventures had been converted and thereupon felt himself</p>
<p>bound to serve the church just as many former sinners, who</p>
<p>have been shown the errors of their way by the Salvation Army,</p>
<p>devote the remaining years of their lives to the task of aiding</p>
<p>and consoling those who are less fortunate.</p>
<p>The name of this Spaniard was Ignatius de Loyola. He</p>
<p>was born in the year before the discovery of America. He had</p>
<p>been wounded and lamed for life and while he was in the hospital</p>
<p>he had seen a vision of the Holy Virgin and her Son, who</p>
<p>bade him give up the wickedness of his former life. He decided</p>
<p>to go to the Holy Land and finish the task of the Crusades.</p>
<p>But a visit to Jerusalem had shown him the impossibility</p>
<p>of the task and he returned west to help in the warfare</p>
<p>upon the heresies of the Lutherans.</p>
<p>In the year 1534 he was studying in Paris at the Sorbonne.</p>
<p>Together with seven other students he founded a fraternity.</p>
<p>The eight men promised each other that they would lead holy</p>
<p>lives, that they would not strive after riches but after righteousness,</p>
<p>and would devote themselves, body and soul, to the service</p>
<p>of the Church. A few years later this small fraternity</p>
<p>had grown into a regular organisation and was recognised by</p>
<p>Pope Paul III as the Society of Jesus.</p>
<p>Loyola had been a military man. He believed in discipline,</p>
<p>and absolute obedience to the orders of the superior dignitaries</p>
<p>became one of the main causes for the enormous success of the</p>
<p>Jesuits. They specialised in education. They gave their</p>
<p>teachers a most thorough-going education before they allowed</p>
<p>them to talk to a single pupil. They lived with their students</p>
<p>and they entered into their games. They watched them with</p>
<p>tender care. And as a result they raised a new generation of</p>
<p>faithful Catholics who took their religious duties as seriously</p>
<p>as the people of the early Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The shrewd Jesuits, however, did not waste all their efforts</p>
<p>upon the education of the poor. They entered the palaces</p>
<p>of the mighty and became the private tutors of future emperors</p>
<p>and kings. And what this meant you will see for yourself</p>
<p>when I tell you about the Thirty Years War. But before</p>
<p>this terrible and final outbreak of religious fanaticism, a great</p>
<p>many other things had happened.</p>
<p>Charles V was dead. Germany and Austria had been left</p>
<p>to his brother Ferdinand. All his other possessions, Spain and</p>
<p>the Netherlands and the Indies and America had gone to his</p>
<p>son Philip. Philip was the son of Charles and a Portuguese</p>
<p>princess who had been first cousin to her own husband. The</p>
<p>children that are born of such a union are apt to be rather</p>
<p>queer. The son of Philip, the unfortunate Don Carlos, (murdered</p>
<p>afterwards with his own father&#x27;s consent,) was crazy.</p>
<p>Philip was not quite crazy, but his zeal for the Church bordered</p>
<p>closely upon religious insanity. He believed that Heaven had</p>
<p>appointed him as one of the saviours of mankind. Therefore,</p>
<p>whosoever was obstinate and refused to share his Majesty&#x27;s</p>
<p>views, proclaimed himself an enemy of the human race and</p>
<p>must be exterminated lest his example corrupt the souls of</p>
<p>his pious neighbours.</p>
<p>Spain, of course, was a very rich country. All the gold and</p>
<p>silver of the new world flowed into the Castilian and Aragonian</p>
<p>treasuries. But Spain suffered from a curious eco-</p>
<p>nomic disease. Her peasants were hard working men and</p>
<p>even harder working women. But the better classes maintained</p>
<p>a supreme contempt for any form of labour, outside of</p>
<p>employment in the army or navy or the civil service. As for</p>
<p>the Moors, who had been very industrious artisans, they had</p>
<p>been driven out of the country long before. As a result, Spain,</p>
<p>the treasure chest of the world, remained a poor country because</p>
<p>all her money had to be sent abroad in exchange for the</p>
<p>wheat and the other necessities of life which the Spaniards</p>
<p>neglected to raise for themselves.</p>
<p>Philip, ruler of the most powerful nation of the</p>
<p>sixteenth century, depended for his revenue upon the taxes</p>
<p>which were gathered in the busy commercial bee-hive of</p>
<p>the Netherlands. But these Flemings and Dutchmen were</p>
<p>devoted followers of the doctrines of Luther and Calvin</p>
<p>and they had cleansed their churches of all images and holy</p>
<p>paintings and they had informed the Pope that they no</p>
<p>longer regarded him as their shepherd but intended to follow</p>
<p>the dictates of their consciences and the commands of their</p>
<p>newly translated Bible.</p>
<p>This placed the king in a very difficult position. He could</p>
<p>not possibly tolerate the heresies of his Dutch subjects, but</p>
<p>he needed their money. If he allowed them to be Protestants</p>
<p>and took no measures to save their souls he was deficient in</p>
<p>his duty toward God. If he sent the Inquisition to the Netherlands</p>
<p>and burned his subjects at the stake, he would lose the</p>
<p>greater part of his income.</p>
<p>Being a man of uncertain will-power he hesitated a long</p>
<p>time. He tried kindness and sternness and promises and</p>
<p>threats. The Hollanders remained obstinate, and continued to</p>
<p>sing psalms and listen to the sermons of their Lutheran and</p>
<p>Calvinist preachers. Philip in his despair sent his ``man of</p>
<p>iron,&#x27;&#x27; the Duke of Alba, to bring these hardened sinners to</p>
<p>terms. Alba began by decapitating those leaders who had not</p>
<p>wisely left the country before his arrival. In the year 1572</p>
<p>(the same year that the French Protestant leaders were all</p>
<p>killed during the terrible night of Saint Bartholomew), he</p>
<p>attacked a number of Dutch cities and massacred the inhabitants</p>
<p>as an example for the others. The next year he laid siege</p>
<p>to the town of Leyden, the manufacturing center of Holland.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the seven small provinces of the northern</p>
<p>Netherlands had formed a defensive union, the so-called union</p>
<p>of Utrecht, and had recognised William of Orange, a German</p>
<p>prince who had been the private secretary of the Emperor</p>
<p>Charles V, as the leader of their army and as commander of</p>
<p>their freebooting sailors, who were known as the Beggars of</p>
<p>the Sea. William, to save Leyden, cut the dykes, created a</p>
<p>shallow inland sea, and delivered the town with the help of a</p>
<p>strangely equipped navy consisting of scows and flat-bottomed</p>
<p>barges which were rowed and pushed and pulled through the</p>
<p>mud until they reached the city walls.</p>
<p>It was the first time that an army of the invincible Spanish</p>
<p>king had suffered such a humiliating defeat. It surprised the</p>
<p>world just as the Japanese victory of Mukden, in the Russian-</p>
<p>Japanese war, surprised our own generation. The Protestant</p>
<p>powers took fresh courage and Philip devised new means for</p>
<p>the purpose of conquering his rebellious subjects. He hired</p>
<p>a poor half-witted fanatic to go and murder William of</p>
<p>Orange. But the sight of their dead leader did not bring the</p>
<p>Seven Provinces to their knees. On the contrary it made them</p>
<p>furiously angry. In the year 1581, the Estates General (the</p>
<p>meeting of the representatives of the Seven Provinces) came</p>
<p>together at the Hague and most solemnly abjured their</p>
<p>``wicked king Philip&#x27;&#x27; and themselves assumed the burden</p>
<p>of sovereignty which thus far had been invested in their</p>
<p>``King by the Grace of God.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>This is a very important event in the history of the great</p>
<p>struggle for political liberty. It was a step which reached</p>
<p>much further than the uprising of the nobles which ended with</p>
<p>the signing of the Magna Carta. These good burghers said</p>
<p>``Between a king and his subjects there is a silent understanding</p>
<p>that both sides shall perform certain services and shall</p>
<p>recognise certain definite duties. If either party fails to live</p>
<p>up to this contract, the other has the right to consider it ter-</p>
<p>minated.&#x27;&#x27; The American subjects of King George III in</p>
<p>the year 1776 came to a similar conclusion. But they had three</p>
<p>thousand miles of ocean between themselves and their ruler</p>
<p>and the Estates General took their decision (which meant a</p>
<p>slow death in case of defeat) within hearing of the Spanish</p>
<p>guns and although in constant fear of an avenging Spanish</p>
<p>fleet.</p>
<p>The stories about a mysterious Spanish fleet that was to conquer</p>
<p>both Holland and England, when Protestant Queen</p>
<p>Elizabeth had succeeded Catholic ``Bloody Mary&#x27;&#x27; was an old</p>
<p>one. For years the sailors of the waterfront had talked</p>
<p>about it. In the eighties of the sixteenth century, the</p>
<p>rumour took a definite shape. According to pilots who had</p>
<p>been in Lisbon, all the Spanish and Portuguese wharves were</p>
<p>building ships. And in the southern Netherlands (in Belgium)</p>
<p>the Duke of Parma was collecting a large expeditionary</p>
<p>force to be carried from Ostend to London and Amsterdam</p>
<p>as soon as the fleet should arrive.</p>
<p>In the year 1586 the Great Armada set sail for the north.</p>
<p>But the harbours of the Flemish coast were blockaded by a</p>
<p>Dutch fleet and the Channel was guarded by the English, and</p>
<p>the Spaniards, accustomed to the quieter seas of the south, did</p>
<p>not know how to navigate in this squally and bleak northern</p>
<p>climate. What happened to the Armada once it was attacked</p>
<p>by ships and by storms I need not tell you. A few ships, by</p>
<p>sailing around Ireland, escaped to tell the terrible story of</p>
<p>defeat. The others perished and lie at the bottom of the North</p>
<p>Sea.</p>
<p>Turn about is fair play. The British nod the Dutch Prot-</p>
<p>estants now carried the war into the territory of the enemy.</p>
<p>Before the end of the century, Houtman, with the help of a</p>
<p>booklet written by Linschoten (a Hollander who had been in</p>
<p>the Portuguese service), had at last discovered the route to</p>
<p>the Indies. As a result the great Dutch East India Company</p>
<p>was founded and a systematic war upon the Portuguese and</p>
<p>Spanish colonies in Asia and Africa was begun in all seriousness.</p>
<p>It was during this early era of colonial conquest that a</p>
<p>curious lawsuit was fought out in the Dutch courts. Early in</p>
<p>the seventeenth century a Dutch Captain by the name of van</p>
<p>Heemskerk, a man who had made himself famous as the head</p>
<p>of an expedition which had tried to discover the North Eastern</p>
<p>Passage to the Indies and who had spent a winter on the frozen</p>
<p>shores of the island of Nova Zembla, had captured a Portuguese</p>
<p>ship in the straits of Malacca. You will remember that</p>
<p>the Pope had divided the world into two equal shares, one of</p>
<p>which had been given to the Spaniards and the other to the</p>
<p>Portuguese. The Portuguese quite naturally regarded the</p>
<p>water which surrounded their Indian islands as part of their</p>
<p>own property and since, for the moment, they were not at war</p>
<p>with the United Seven Netherlands, they claimed that the</p>
<p>captain of a private Dutch trading company had no right to</p>
<p>enter their private domain and steal their ships. And they</p>
<p>brought suit. The directors of the Dutch East India Company</p>
<p>hired a bright young lawyer, by the name of De Groot or</p>
<p>Grotius, to defend their case. He made the astonishing plea</p>
<p>that the ocean is free to all comers. Once outside the distance</p>
<p>which a cannon ball fired from the land can reach, the sea is</p>
<p>or (according to Grotius) ought to be, a free and open highway</p>
<p>to all the ships of all nations. It was the first time that this</p>
<p>startling doctrine had been publicly pronounced in a court</p>
<p>of law. It was opposed by all the other seafaring people. To</p>
<p>counteract the effect of Grotius&#x27; famous plea for the ``Mare</p>
<p>Liberum,&#x27;&#x27; or ``Open Sea,&#x27;&#x27; John Selden, the Englishman,</p>
<p>wrote his famous treatise upon the <code>Mare Clausum&#x27;&#x27; or </code>Closed</p>
<p>Sea&#x27;&#x27; which treated of the natural right of a sovereign to regard</p>
<p>the seas which surrounded his country as belonging to his territory.</p>
<p>I mention this here because the question had not yet</p>
<p>been decided and during the last war caused all sorts of</p>
<p>difficulties and complications.</p>
<p>To return to the warfare between Spaniard and Hollander</p>
<p>and Englishman, before twenty years were over the most</p>
<p>valuable colonies of the Indies and the Cape of Good Hope and</p>
<p>Ceylon and those along the coast of China and even Japan were</p>
<p>in Protestant hands. In 1621 a West Indian Company was</p>
<p>founded which conquered Brazil and in North America built</p>
<p>a fortress called Nieuw Amsterdam at the mouth of the river</p>
<p>which Henry Hudson had discovered in the year 1609</p>
<p>These new colonies enriched both England and the Dutch</p>
<p>Republic to such an extent that they could hire foreign soldiers</p>
<p>to do their fighting on land while they devoted themselves</p>
<p>to commerce and trade. To them the Protestant revolt meant</p>
<p>independence and prosperity. But in many other parts of</p>
<p>Europe it meant a succession of horrors compared to which the</p>
<p>last war was a mild excursion of kindly Sunday-school boys.</p>
<p>The Thirty Years War which broke out in the year 1618</p>
<p>and which ended with the famous treaty of Westphalia in 1648</p>
<p>was the perfectly natural result of a century of ever increasing</p>
<p>religious hatred. It was, as I have said, a terrible war. Everybody</p>
<p>fought everybody else and the struggle ended only when</p>
<p>all parties had been thoroughly exhausted and could fight no</p>
<p>longer.</p>
<p>In less than a generation it turned many parts of central</p>
<p>Europe into a wilderness, where the hungry peasants fought</p>
<p>for the carcass of a dead horse with the even hungrier wolf.</p>
<p>Five-sixths of all the German towns and villages were destroyed.</p>
<p>The Palatinate, in western Germany, was plundered</p>
<p>twenty-eight times. And a population of eighteen million</p>
<p>people was reduced to four million.</p>
<p>The hostilities began almost as soon as Ferdinand II of</p>
<p>the House of Habsburg had been elected Emperor. He was</p>
<p>the product of a most careful Jesuit training and was a most</p>
<p>obedient and devout son of the Church. The vow which he had</p>
<p>made as a young man, that he would eradicate all sects and</p>
<p>all heresies from his domains, Ferdinand kept to the best of</p>
<p>his ability. Two days before his election, his chief opponent,</p>
<p>Frederick, the Protestant Elector of the Palatinate and a</p>
<p>son-in-law of James I of England, had been made King of</p>
<p>Bohemia, in direct violation of Ferdinand&#x27;s wishes.</p>
<p>At once the Habsburg armies marched into Bohemia. The</p>
<p>young king looked in vain for assistance against this formidable</p>
<p>enemy. The Dutch Republic was willing to help, but,</p>
<p>engaged in a desperate war of its own with the Spanish branch</p>
<p>of the Habsburgs, it could do little. The Stuarts in England</p>
<p>were more interested in strengthening their own absolute power</p>
<p>at home than spending money and men upon a forlorn adventure</p>
<p>in far away Bohemia. After a struggle of a few months,</p>
<p>the Elector of the Palatinate was driven away and his domains</p>
<p>were given to the Catholic house of Bavaria. This was the beginning</p>
<p>of the great war.</p>
<p>Then the Habsburg armies, under Tilly and Wallenstein,</p>
<p>fought their way through the Protestant part of Germany</p>
<p>until they had reached the shores of the Baltic. A Catholic</p>
<p>neighbour meant serious danger to the Protestant king of</p>
<p>Denmark. Christian IV tried to defend himself by attacking</p>
<p>his enemies before they had become too strong for him. The</p>
<p>Danish armies marched into Germany but were defeated.</p>
<p>Wallenstein followed up his victory with such energy and violence</p>
<p>that Denmark was forced to sue for peace. Only one</p>
<p>town of the Baltic then remained in the hands of the Protestants.</p>
<p>That was Stralsund.</p>
<p>There, in the early summer of the year 1630, landed King</p>
<p>Gustavus Adolphus of the house of Vasa, king of Sweden,</p>
<p>and famous as the man who had defended his country against</p>
<p>the Russians. A Protestant prince of unlimited ambition,</p>
<p>desirous of making Sweden the centre of a great Northern</p>
<p>Empire, Gustavus Adolphus was welcomed by the Protestant</p>
<p>princes of Europe as the saviour of the Lutheran cause. He</p>
<p>defeated Tilly, who had just successfully butchered the Protestant</p>
<p>inhabitants of Magdeburg. Then his troops began their</p>
<p>great march through the heart of Germany in an attempt to</p>
<p>reach the Habsburg possessions in Italy. Threatened in the</p>
<p>rear by the Catholics, Gustavus suddenly veered around and</p>
<p>defeated the main Habsburg army in the battle of Lutzen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Swedish king was killed when he strayed</p>
<p>away from his troops. But the Habsburg power had been</p>
<p>broken.</p>
<p>Ferdinand, who was a suspicious sort of person, at once</p>
<p>began to distrust his own servants. Wallenstein, his commander-</p>
<p>in-chief, was murdered at his instigation. When the</p>
<p>Catholic Bourbons, who ruled France and hated their Habsburg</p>
<p>rivals, heard of this, they joined the Protestant Swedes.</p>
<p>The armies of Louis XIII invaded the eastern part of Germany,</p>
<p>and Turenne and Conde added their fame to that of</p>
<p>Baner and Weimar, the Swedish generals, by murdering, pillaging</p>
<p>and burning Habsburg property. This brought great</p>
<p>fame and riches to the Swedes and caused the Danes to become</p>
<p>envious. The Protestant Danes thereupon declared war upon</p>
<p>the Protestant Swedes who were the allies of the Catholic</p>
<p>French, whose political leader, the Cardinal de Richelieu, had</p>
<p>just deprived the Huguenots (or French Protestants) of those</p>
<p>rights of public worship which the Edict of Nantes of the year</p>
<p>1598 had guaranteed them.</p>
<p>The war, after the habit of such encounters, did not decide</p>
<p>anything, when it came to an end with the treaty of Westphalia</p>
<p>in 1648. The Catholic powers remained Catholic and</p>
<p>the Protestant powers stayed faithful to the doctrines of</p>
<p>Luther and Calvin and Zwingli. The Swiss and Dutch Protestants</p>
<p>were recognised as independent republics. France</p>
<p>kept the cities of Metz and Toul and Verdun and a part of the</p>
<p>Alsace. The Holy Roman Empire continued to exist as a sort</p>
<p>of scare-crow state, without men, without money, without hope</p>
<p>and without courage.</p>
<p>The only good the Thirty Years War accomplished was a</p>
<p>negative one. It discouraged both Catholics and Protestants</p>
<p>from ever trying it again. Henceforth they left each other in</p>
<p>peace. This however did not mean that religious feeling and</p>
<p>theological hatred had been removed from this earth. On the</p>
<p>contrary. The quarrels between Catholic and Protestant</p>
<p>came to an end, but the disputes between the different Protestant</p>
<p>sects continued as bitterly as ever before. In Holland</p>
<p>a difference of opinion as to the true nature of predestination</p>
<p>(a very obscure point of theology, but exceedingly important</p>
<p>the eyes of your great-grandfather) caused a quarrel which</p>
<p>ended with the decapitation of John of Oldenbarneveldt, the</p>
<p>Dutch statesman, who had been responsible for the success of</p>
<p>the Republic during the first twenty years of its independence,</p>
<p>and who was the great organising genius of her Indian trading</p>
<p>company. In England, the feud led to civil war.</p>
<p>But before I tell you of this outbreak which led to the first</p>
<p>execution by process-of-law of a European king, I ought to</p>
<p>say something about the previous history of England. In this</p>
<p>book I am trying to give you only those events of the past</p>
<p>which can throw a light upon the conditions of the present</p>
<p>world. If I do not mention certain countries, the cause is not</p>
<p>to be found in any secret dislike on my part. I wish that I</p>
<p>could tell you what happened to Norway and Switzerland and</p>
<p>Serbia and China. But these lands exercised no great influence</p>
<p>upon the development of Europe in the sixteenth and</p>
<p>seventeenth centuries. I therefore pass them by with a polite</p>
<p>and very respectful bow. England however is in a different</p>
<p>position. What the people of that small island have done during</p>
<p>the last five hundred years has shaped the course of history</p>
<p>in every corner of the world. Without a proper knowledge of</p>
<p>the background of English history, you cannot understand</p>
<p>what you read in the newspapers. And it is therefore necessary</p>
<p>that you know how England happened to develop a parliamentary</p>
<p>form of government while the rest of the European continent</p>
<p>was still ruled by absolute monarchs.</p>
<p>THE ENGLISH REVOLUTION</p>
<p>HOW THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE ``DIVINE</p>
<p>RIGHT&#x27;&#x27; OF KINGS AND THE LESS DIVINE</p>
<p>BUT MORE REASONABLE ``RIGHT OF</p>
<p>PARLIAMENT&#x27;&#x27; ENDED DISASTROUSLY FOR</p>
<p>KING CHARLES II</p>
<p>CAESAR, the earliest explorer of north-western Europe, had</p>
<p>crossed the Channel in the year 55 B.C. and had conquered</p>
<p>England. During four centuries the country then remained</p>
<p>a Roman province. But when the Barbarians began to</p>
<p>threaten Rome, the garrisons were called back from the frontier</p>
<p>that they might defend the home country and Britannia</p>
<p>was left without a government and without protection.</p>
<p>As soon as this became known among the hungry Saxon</p>
<p>tribes of northern Germany, they sailed across the North Sea</p>
<p>and made themselves at home in the prosperous island. They</p>
<p>founded a number of independent Anglo-Saxon kingdoms</p>
<p>(so called after the original Angles or English and the Saxon</p>
<p>invaders) but these small states were for ever quarrelling with</p>
<p>each other and no King was strong enough to establish himself</p>
<p>as the head of a united country. For more than five hundred</p>
<p>years, Mercia and Northumbria and Wessex and Sussex</p>
<p>and Kent and East Anglia, or whatever their names, were</p>
<p>exposed to attacks from various Scandinavian pirates. Finally</p>
<p>in the eleventh century, England, together with Norway and</p>
<p>northern Germany became part of the large Danish Empire</p>
<p>of Canute the Great and the last vestiges of independence</p>
<p>disappeared.</p>
<p>The Danes, in the course of time, were driven away but no</p>
<p>sooner was England free, than it was conquered for the fourth</p>
<p>time. The new enemies were the descendants of another tribe</p>
<p>of Norsemen who early in the tenth century had invaded</p>
<p>France and had founded the Duchy of Normandy. William,</p>
<p>Duke of Normandy, who for a long time had looked across the</p>
<p>water with an envious eye, crossed the Channel in October</p>
<p>of the year 1066. At the battle of Hastings, on October the</p>
<p>fourteenth of that year, he destroyed the weak forces of Harold</p>
<p>of Wessex, the last of the Anglo-Saxon Kings and established</p>
<p>himself as King of England. But neither William nor his</p>
<p>successors of the House of Anjou and Plantagenet regarded</p>
<p>England as their true home. To them the island was merely a</p>
<p>part of their great inheritance on the continent--a sort of</p>
<p>colony inhabited by rather backward people upon whom they</p>
<p>forced their own language and civilisation. Gradually however</p>
<p>the <code>colony&#x27;&#x27; of England gained upon the </code>Mother</p>
<p>country&#x27;&#x27; of Normandy. At the same time the Kings of</p>
<p>France were trying desperately to get rid of the powerful Norman-</p>
<p>English neighbours who were in truth no more than disobedient</p>
<p>servants of the French crown. After a century of war</p>
<p>fare the French people, under the leadership of a young girl by</p>
<p>the name of Joan of Arc, drove the ``foreigners&#x27;&#x27; from their</p>
<p>soil. Joan herself, taken a prisoner at the battle of Compiegne</p>
<p>in the year 1430 and sold by her Burgundian captors to the</p>
<p>English soldiers, was burned as a witch. But the English</p>
<p>never gained foothold upon the continent and their Kings were</p>
<p>at last able to devote all their time to their British possessions.</p>
<p>As the feudal nobility of the island had been engaged in one of</p>
<p>those strange feuds which were as common in the middle ages</p>
<p>as measles and small-pox, and as the greater part of the old</p>
<p>landed proprietors had been killed during these so-called Wars</p>
<p>of the Roses, it was quite easy for the Kings to increase their</p>
<p>royal power. And by the end of the fifteenth century, England</p>
<p>was a strongly centralised country, ruled by Henry VII</p>
<p>of the House of Tudor, whose famous Court of Justice, the</p>
<p>``Star Chamber&#x27;&#x27; of terrible memory, suppressed all attempts</p>
<p>on the part of the surviving nobles to regain their old influence</p>
<p>upon the government of the country with the utmost severity.</p>
<p>In the year 1509 Henry VII was succeeded by his son</p>
<p>Henry VIII, and from that moment on the history of England</p>
<p>gained a new importance for the country ceased to be a</p>
<p>mediaeval island and became a modern state.</p>
<p>Henry had no deep interest in religion. He gladly used a</p>
<p>private disagreement with the Pope about one of his many</p>
<p>divorces to declare himself independent of Rome and make</p>
<p>the church of England the first of those ``nationalistic churches&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>in which the worldly ruler also acts as the spiritual head of his</p>
<p>subjects. This peaceful reformation of 1034 not only gave</p>
<p>the house of Tudor the support of the English clergy, who</p>
<p>for a long time had been exposed to the violent attacks of many</p>
<p>Lutheran propagandists, but it also increased the Royal power</p>
<p>through the confiscation of the former possessions of the</p>
<p>monasteries. At the same time it made Henry popular with the</p>
<p>merchants and tradespeople, who as the proud and prosperous</p>
<p>inhabitants of an island which was separated from the rest of</p>
<p>Europe by a wide and deep channel, had a great dislike for</p>
<p>everything ``foreign&#x27;&#x27; and did not want an Italian bishop to rule</p>
<p>their honest British souls.</p>
<p>In 1517 Henry died. He left the throne to his small son,</p>
<p>aged ten. The guardians of the child, favoring the modern</p>
<p>Lutheran doctrines, did their best to help the cause of Protestantism.</p>
<p>But the boy died before he was sixteen, and was succeeded</p>
<p>by his sister Mary, the wife of Philip II of Spain, who</p>
<p>burned the bishops of the new ``national church&#x27;&#x27; and in other</p>
<p>ways followed the example of her royal Spanish husband</p>
<p>Fortunately she died, in the year 1558, and was succeeded</p>
<p>by Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn,</p>
<p>the second of his six wives, whom he had decapitated when she</p>
<p>no longer pleased him. Elizabeth, who had spent some time in</p>
<p>prison, and who had been released only at the request of the</p>
<p>Holy Roman Emperor, was a most cordial enemy of everything</p>
<p>Catholic and Spanish. She shared her father&#x27;s indifference</p>
<p>in the matter of religion but she inherited his ability as a</p>
<p>very shrewd judge of character, and spent the forty-five years</p>
<p>of her reign in strengthening the power of the dynasty and in</p>
<p>increasing the revenue and possessions of her merry islands.</p>
<p>In this she was most ably assisted by a number of men who</p>
<p>gathered around her throne and made the Elizabethan age a</p>
<p>period of such importance that you ought to study it in detail</p>
<p>in one of the special books of which I shall tell you in the</p>
<p>bibliography at the end of this volume.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, did not feel entirely safe upon her</p>
<p>throne. She had a rival and a very dangerous one. Mary,</p>
<p>of the house of Stuart, daughter of a French duchess and a</p>
<p>Scottish father, widow of king Francis II of France and</p>
<p>daughter-in-law of Catherine of Medici (who had organised</p>
<p>the murders of Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s night), was the mother of</p>
<p>a little boy who was afterwards to become the first Stuart king</p>
<p>of England. She was an ardent Catholic and a willing friend</p>
<p>to those who were the enemies of Elizabeth. Her own lack</p>
<p>of political ability and the violent methods which she employed</p>
<p>to punish her Calvinistic subjects, caused a revolution in Scotland</p>
<p>and forced Mary to take refuge on English territory. For</p>
<p>eighteen years she remained in England, plotting forever and</p>
<p>a day against the woman who had given her shelter and who</p>
<p>was at last obliged to follow the advice of her trusted councilors</p>
<p>``to cutte off the Scottish Queen&#x27;s heade.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The head was duly ``cutte off&#x27;&#x27; in the year 1587 and caused</p>
<p>a war with Spain. But the combined navies of England and</p>
<p>Holland defeated Philip&#x27;s Invincible Armada, as we have already</p>
<p>seen, and the blow which had been meant to destroy the</p>
<p>power of the two great anti-Catholic leaders was turned into a</p>
<p>profitable business adventure.</p>
<p>For now at last, after many years of hesitation, the English</p>
<p>as well as the Dutch thought it their good right to invade</p>
<p>the Indies and America and avenge the ills which their Protes-</p>
<p>tent brethren had suffered at the hands of the Spaniards. The</p>
<p>English had been among the earliest successors of Columbus.</p>
<p>British ships, commanded by the Venetian pilot Giovanni Caboto</p>
<p>(or Cabot), had been the first to discover and explore the</p>
<p>northern American continent in 1496. Labrador and Newfoundland</p>
<p>were of little importance as a possible colony. But</p>
<p>the banks of Newfoundland offered a rich reward to the</p>
<p>English fishing fleet. A year later, in 1497, the same Cabot</p>
<p>had explored the coast of Florida.</p>
<p>Then had come the busy years of Henry VII and Henry</p>
<p>VIII when there had been no money for foreign explorations.</p>
<p>But under Elizabeth, with the country at peace and Mary</p>
<p>Stuart in prison, the sailors could leave their harbour without</p>
<p>fear for the fate of those whom they left behind. While Elizabeth</p>
<p>was still a child, Willoughby had ventured to sail past the</p>
<p>North Cape and one of his captains, Richard Chancellor, pushing</p>
<p>further eastward in his quest of a possible road to the Indies,</p>
<p>had reached Archangel, Russia, where he had established</p>
<p>diplomatic and commercial relations with the mysterious rulers</p>
<p>of this distant Muscovite Empire. During the first years of</p>
<p>Elizabeth&#x27;s rule this voyage had been followed up by many</p>
<p>others. Merchant adventurers, working for the benefit of a</p>
<p>``joint stock Company&#x27;&#x27; had laid the foundations of trading</p>
<p>companies which in later centuries were to become colonies.</p>
<p>Half pirate, half diplomat, willing to stake everything on a</p>
<p>single lucky voyage, smugglers of everything that could be</p>
<p>loaded into the hold of a vessel, dealers in men and merchandise</p>
<p>with equal indifference to everything except their profit, the</p>
<p>sailors of Elizabeth had carried the English flag and the fame</p>
<p>of their Virgin Queen to the four corners of the Seven Seas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile William Shakespeare kept her Majesty amused at</p>
<p>home, and the best brains and the best wit of England co-operated</p>
<p>with the queen in her attempt to change the feudal inheritance</p>
<p>of Henry VIII into a modern national state.</p>
<p>In the year 1603 the old lady died at the age of seventy.</p>
<p>Her cousin, the great-grandson of her own grandfather Henry</p>
<p>VII and son of Mary Stuart, her rival and enemy, succeeded</p>
<p>her as James I. By the Grace of God, he found himself the</p>
<p>ruler of a country which had escaped the fate of its continental</p>
<p>rivals. While the European Protestants and Catholics were</p>
<p>killing each other in a hopeless attempt to break the power of</p>
<p>their adversaries and establish the exclusive rule of their own</p>
<p>particular creed, England was at peace and ``reformed&#x27;&#x27; at</p>
<p>leisure without going to the extremes of either Luther or</p>
<p>Loyola. It gave the island kingdom an enormous advantage in</p>
<p>the coming struggle for colonial possessions. It assured England</p>
<p>a leadership in international affairs which that country</p>
<p>has maintained until the present day. Not even the disastrous</p>
<p>adventure with the Stuarts was able to stop this normal development.</p>
<p>The Stuarts, who succeeded the Tudors, were ``foreigners&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>in England. They do not seem to have appreciated or understood</p>
<p>this fact. The native house of Tudor could steal a horse,</p>
<p>but the ``foreign&#x27;&#x27; Stuarts were not allowed to look at the</p>
<p>bridle without causing great popular disapproval. Old Queen</p>
<p>Bess had ruled her domains very much as she pleased. In</p>
<p>general however, she had always followed a policy which meant</p>
<p>money in the pocket of the honest (and otherwise) British</p>
<p>merchants. Hence the Queen had been always assured of the</p>
<p>wholehearted support of her grateful people. And small liberties</p>
<p>taken with some of the rights and prerogatives of Parliament</p>
<p>were gladly overlooked for the ulterior benefits which</p>
<p>were derived from her Majesty&#x27;s strong and successful foreign</p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p>Outwardly King James continued the same policy. But he</p>
<p>lacked that personal enthusiasm which had been so very typical</p>
<p>of his great predecessor. Foreign commerce continued to be</p>
<p>encouraged. The Catholics were not granted any liberties.</p>
<p>But when Spain smiled pleasantly upon England in an effort</p>
<p>to establish peaceful relations, James was seen to smile back.</p>
<p>The majority of the English people did not like this, but</p>
<p>James was their King and they kept quiet.</p>
<p>Soon there were other causes of friction. King James and</p>
<p>his son, Charles I, who succeeded him in the year 1625 both</p>
<p>firmly believed in the principle of their ``divine right&#x27;&#x27; to</p>
<p>administer their realm as they thought fit without consulting the</p>
<p>wishes of their subjects. The idea was not new. The Popes,</p>
<p>who in more than one way had been the successors of the</p>
<p>Roman Emperors (or rather of the Roman Imperial ideal of</p>
<p>a single and undivided state covering the entire known world),</p>
<p>had always regarded themselves and had been publicly recognised</p>
<p>as the ``Vice-Regents of Christ upon Earth.&#x27;&#x27; No one</p>
<p>questioned the right of God to rule the world as He saw fit.</p>
<p>As a natural result, few ventured to doubt the right of the</p>
<p>divine ``Vice-Regent&#x27;&#x27; to do the same thing and to demand the</p>
<p>obedience of the masses because he was the direct representative</p>
<p>of the Absolute Ruler of the Universe and responsible</p>
<p>only to Almighty God.</p>
<p>When the Lutheran Reformation proved successful, those</p>
<p>rights which formerly had been invested in the Papacy were</p>
<p>taken over by the many European sovereigns who became</p>
<p>Protestants. As head of their own national or dynastic</p>
<p>churches they insisted upon being ``Christ&#x27;s Vice-Regents&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>within the limit of their own territory. The people did not question</p>
<p>the right of their rulers to take such a step. They accepted</p>
<p>it, just as we in our own day accept the idea of a representative</p>
<p>system which to us seems the only reasonable and just</p>
<p>form of government. It is unfair therefore to state that either</p>
<p>Lutheranism or Calvinism caused the particular feeling of</p>
<p>irritation which greeted King-James&#x27;s oft and loudly repeated</p>
<p>assertion of his ``Divine Right.&#x27;&#x27; There must have been other</p>
<p>grounds for the genuine English disbelief in the Divine Right</p>
<p>of Kings.</p>
<p>The first positive denial of the ``Divine Right&#x27;&#x27; of sovereigns</p>
<p>had been heard in the Netherlands when the Estates General</p>
<p>abjured their lawful sovereign King Philip II of Spain, in the</p>
<p>year 1581. <code>The King,&#x27;&#x27; so they said, </code>has broken his contract</p>
<p>and the King therefore is dismissed like any other unfaithful</p>
<p>servant.&#x27;&#x27; Since then, this particular idea of a king&#x27;s</p>
<p>responsibilities towards his subjects had spread among many of the</p>
<p>nations who inhabited the shores of the North Sea. They were</p>
<p>in a very favourable position. They were rich. The poor people</p>
<p>in the heart of central Europe, at the mercy of their</p>
<p>Ruler&#x27;s body-guard, could not afford to discuss a problem</p>
<p>which would at once land them in the deepest dungeon of the</p>
<p>nearest castle. But the merchants of Holland and England</p>
<p>who possessed the capital necessary for the maintenance of</p>
<p>great armies and navies, who knew how to handle the almighty</p>
<p>weapon called ``credit,&#x27;&#x27; had no such fear. They were willing</p>
<p>to pit the ``Divine Right&#x27;&#x27; of their own good money against</p>
<p>the ``Divine Right&#x27;&#x27; of any Habsburg or Bourbon or Stuart.</p>
<p>They knew that their guilders and shillings could beat the</p>
<p>clumsy feudal armies which were the only weapons of the King.</p>
<p>They dared to act, where others were condemned to suffer</p>
<p>in silence or run the risk of the scaffold.</p>
<p>When the Stuarts began to annoy the people of England</p>
<p>with their claim that they had a right to do what they pleased</p>
<p>and never mind the responsibility, the English middle classes</p>
<p>used the House of Commons as their first line of defence</p>
<p>against this abuse of the Royal Power. The Crown refused to</p>
<p>give in and the King sent Parliament about its own business.</p>
<p>Eleven long years, Charles I ruled alone. He levied taxes</p>
<p>which most people regarded as illegal and he managed his</p>
<p>British kingdom as if it had been his own country estate. He</p>
<p>had capable assistants and we must say that he had the courage</p>
<p>of his convictions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of assuring himself of the support</p>
<p>of his faithful Scottish subjects, Charles became involved in</p>
<p>a quarrel with the Scotch Presbyterians. Much against his</p>
<p>will, but forced by his need for ready cash, Charles was at</p>
<p>last obliged to call Parliament together once more. It met in</p>
<p>April of 1640 and showed an ugly temper. It was dissolved</p>
<p>a few weeks later. A new Parliament convened in November.</p>
<p>This one was even less pliable than the first one. The members</p>
<p>understood that the question of ``Government by Divine</p>
<p>Right&#x27;&#x27; or ``Government by Parliament&#x27;&#x27; must be fought out</p>
<p>for good and all. They attacked the King in his chief councillors</p>
<p>and executed half a dozen of them. They announced that</p>
<p>they would not allow themselves to be dissolved without their</p>
<p>own approval. Finally on December 1, 1641, they presented</p>
<p>to the King a ``Grand Remonstrance&#x27;&#x27; which gave a detailed</p>
<p>account of the many grievances of the people against their Ruler.</p>
<p>Charles, hoping to derive some support for his own policy</p>
<p>in the country districts, left London in January of 1642. Each</p>
<p>side organised an army and prepared for open warfare between</p>
<p>the absolute power of the crown and the absolute power</p>
<p>of Parliament. During this struggle, the most powerful religious</p>
<p>element of England, called the Puritans, (they were</p>
<p>Anglicans who had tried to purify their doctrines to the most</p>
<p>absolute limits), came quickly to the front. The regiments of</p>
<p>``Godly men,&#x27;&#x27; commanded by Oliver Cromwell, with their</p>
<p>iron discipline and their profound confidence in the holiness of</p>
<p>their aims, soon became the model for the entire army of the</p>
<p>opposition. Twice Charles was defeated. After the battle</p>
<p>of Naseby, in 1645, he fled to Scotland. The Scotch sold him</p>
<p>to the English.</p>
<p>There followed a period of intrigue and an uprising</p>
<p>of the Scotch Presbyterians against the English Puritan.</p>
<p>In August of the year 1648 after the three-days&#x27; battle of</p>
<p>Preston Pans, Cromwell made an end to this second civil war,</p>
<p>and took Edinburgh. Meanwhile his soldiers, tired of further</p>
<p>talk and wasted hours of religious debate, had decided to act</p>
<p>on their own initiative. They removed from Parliament all</p>
<p>those who did not agree with their own Puritan views. Thereupon</p>
<p>the ``Rump,&#x27;&#x27; which was what was left of the old Parliament,</p>
<p>accused the King of high treason. The House of Lords</p>
<p>refused to sit as a tribunal. A special tribunal was appointed</p>
<p>and it condemned the King to death. On the 30th of January</p>
<p>of the year 1649, King Charles walked quietly out of a window</p>
<p>of White Hall onto the scaffold. That day, the Sovereign</p>
<p>People, acting through their chosen representatives, for the</p>
<p>first time executed a ruler who had failed to understand his own</p>
<p>position in the modern state.</p>
<p>The period which followed the death of Charles is usually</p>
<p>called after Oliver Cromwell. At first the unofficial Dictator</p>
<p>of England, he was officially made Lord Protector in the year</p>
<ol start="1653">
<li>He ruled five years. He used this period to continue</li>
</ol>
<p>the policies of Elizabeth. Spain once more became the arch</p>
<p>enemy of England and war upon the Spaniard was made a national</p>
<p>and sacred issue.</p>
<p>The commerce of England and the interests of the traders</p>
<p>were placed before everything else, and the Protestant creed of</p>
<p>the strictest nature was rigourously maintained. In maintaining</p>
<p>England&#x27;s position abroad, Cromwell was successful. As a</p>
<p>social reformer, however, he failed very badly. The world is</p>
<p>made up of a number of people and they rarely think alike.</p>
<p>In the long run, this seems a very wise provision. A government</p>
<p>of and by and for one single part of the entire community</p>
<p>cannot possibly survive. The Puritans had been a great</p>
<p>force for good when they tried to correct the abuse of the</p>
<p>royal power. As the absolute Rulers of England they became</p>
<p>intolerable.</p>
<p>When Cromwell died in 1658, it was an easy matter for the</p>
<p>Stuarts to return to their old kingdom. Indeed, they were</p>
<p>welcomed as ``deliverers&#x27;&#x27; by the people who had found the</p>
<p>yoke of the meek Puritans quite as hard to bear as that of autocratic</p>
<p>King Charles. Provided the Stuarts were willing to forget</p>
<p>about the Divine Right of their late and lamented father</p>
<p>and were willing to recognise the superiority of Parliament, the</p>
<p>people promised that they would be loyal and faithful subjects.</p>
<p>Two generations tried to make a success of this new arrangement.</p>
<p>But the Stuarts apparently had not learned their</p>
<p>lesson and were unable to drop their bad habits. Charles II,</p>
<p>who came back in the year 1660, was an amiable but worthless</p>
<p>person. His indolence and his constitutional insistence upon</p>
<p>following the easiest course, together with his conspicuous success</p>
<p>as a liar, prevented an open outbreak between himself and</p>
<p>his people. By the act of Uniformity in 1662 he broke the</p>
<p>power of the Puritan clergy by banishing all dissenting clergymen</p>
<p>from their parishes. By the so-called Conventicle Act of</p>
<p>1664 he tried to prevent the Dissenters from attending religious</p>
<p>meetings by a threat of deportation to the West Indies. This</p>
<p>looked too much like the good old days of Divine Right. People</p>
<p>began to show the old and well-known signs of impatience,</p>
<p>and Parliament suddenly experienced difficulty in providing</p>
<p>the King with funds.</p>
<p>Since he could not get money from an unwilling Parliament,</p>
<p>Charles borrowed it secretly from his neighbour and cousin</p>
<p>King Louis of France. He betrayed his Protestant allies in</p>
<p>return for 200,000 pounds per year, and laughed at the poor</p>
<p>simpletons of Parliament.</p>
<p>Economic independence suddenly gave the King great faith</p>
<p>in his own strength. He had spent many years of exile among</p>
<p>his Catholic relations and he had a secret liking for their</p>
<p>religion. Perhaps he could bring England back to Rome! He</p>
<p>passed a Declaration of Indulgence which suspended the old</p>
<p>laws against the Catholics and Dissenters. This happened just</p>
<p>when Charles&#x27; younger brother James was said to have become</p>
<p>a Catholic. All this looked suspicious to the man in the street</p>
<p>People began to fear some terrible Popish plot. A new spirit</p>
<p>of unrest entered the land. Most of the people wanted to prevent</p>
<p>another outbreak of civil war. To them Royal Oppression</p>
<p>and a Catholic King--yea, even Divine Right,--were</p>
<p>preferable to a new struggle between members of the same</p>
<p>race. Others however were less lenient. They were the much-</p>
<p>feared Dissenters, who invariably had the courage of their</p>
<p>convictions. They were led by several great noblemen who did</p>
<p>not want to see a return of the old days of absolute royal</p>
<p>power.</p>
<p>For almost ten years, these two great parties, the Whigs</p>
<p>(the middle class element, called by this derisive name be-</p>
<p>cause in the year 1640 a lot of Scottish Whiggamores or horse-</p>
<p>drovers headed by the Presbyterian clergy, had marched to</p>
<p>Edinburgh to oppose the King) and the Tories (an epithet</p>
<p>originally used against the Royalist Irish adherents but now</p>
<p>applied to the supporters of the King) opposed each other, but</p>
<p>neither wished to bring about a crisis. They allowed Charles to</p>
<p>die peacefully in his bed and permitted the Catholic James II</p>
<p>to succeed his brother in 1685. But when James, after threatening</p>
<p>the country with the terrible foreign invention of a ``standing</p>
<p>army&#x27;&#x27; (which was to be commanded by Catholic Frenchmen),</p>
<p>issued a second Declaration of Indulgence in 1688, and</p>
<p>ordered it to be read in all Anglican churches, he went just a</p>
<p>trifle beyond that line of sensible demarcation which can only be</p>
<p>transgressed by the most popular of rulers under very</p>
<p>exceptional circumstances. Seven bishops refused to comply</p>
<p>with the Royal Command. They were accused of ``seditious</p>
<p>libel.&#x27;&#x27; They were brought before a court. The jury which</p>
<p>pronounced the verdict of ``not guilty&#x27;&#x27; reaped a rich harvest</p>
<p>of popular approval.</p>
<p>At this unfortunate moment, James (who in a second marriage</p>
<p>had taken to wife Maria of the Catholic house of Modena-</p>
<p>Este) became the father of a son. This meant that the throne</p>
<p>was to go to a Catholic boy rather than to his older sisters,</p>
<p>Mary and Anne, who were Protestants. The man in the street</p>
<p>again grew suspicious. Maria of Modena was too old to have</p>
<p>children! It was all part of a plot! A strange baby had been</p>
<p>brought into the palace by some Jesuit priest that England</p>
<p>might have a Catholic monarch. And so on. It looked as if</p>
<p>another civil war would break out. Then seven well-known</p>
<p>men, both Whigs and Tories, wrote a letter asking the husband</p>
<p>of James&#x27;s oldest daughter Mary, William III the Stadtholder</p>
<p>or head of the Dutch Republic, to come to England and</p>
<p>deliver the country from its lawful but entirely undesirable</p>
<p>sovereign.</p>
<p>On the fifth of November of the year 1688, William landed</p>
<p>at Torbay. As he did not wish to make a martyr out of his</p>
<p>father-in-law, he helped him to escape safely to France. On</p>
<p>the 22nd of January of 1689 he summoned Parliament. On</p>
<p>the 13th of February of the same year he and his wife Mary</p>
<p>were proclaimed joint sovereigns of England and the country</p>
<p>was saved for the Protestant cause.</p>
<p>Parliament, having undertaken to be something more than</p>
<p>a mere advisory body to the King, made the best of its</p>
<p>opportunities. The old Petition of Rights of the year 1628 was</p>
<p>fished out of a forgotten nook of the archives. A second and</p>
<p>more drastic Bill of Rights demanded that the sovereign of</p>
<p>England should belong to the Anglican church. Furthermore</p>
<p>it stated that the king had no right to suspend the laws or</p>
<p>permit certain privileged citizens to disobey certain laws. It</p>
<p>stipulated that ``without consent of Parliament no taxes could</p>
<p>be levied and no army could be maintained.&#x27;&#x27; Thus in the year</p>
<p>1689 did England acquire an amount of liberty unknown in</p>
<p>any other country of Europe.</p>
<p>But it is not only on account of this great liberal measure</p>
<p>that the rule of William in England is still remembered. During</p>
<p>his lifetime, government by a ``responsible&#x27;&#x27; ministry first</p>
<p>developed. No king of course can rule alone. He needs a few</p>
<p>trusted advisors. The Tudors had their Great Council which</p>
<p>was composed of Nobles and Clergy. This body grew too</p>
<p>large. It was restricted to the small ``Privy Council.&#x27;&#x27; In the</p>
<p>course of time it became the custom of these councillors to meet</p>
<p>the king in a cabinet in the palace. Hence they were called</p>
<p>the ``Cabinet Council.&#x27;&#x27; After a short while they were known</p>
<p>as the ``Cabinet.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>William, like most English sovereigns before him, had</p>
<p>chosen his advisors from among all parties. But with the increased</p>
<p>strength of Parliament, he had found it impossible to</p>
<p>direct the politics of the country with the help of the Tories</p>
<p>while the Whigs had a majority in the house of Commons.</p>
<p>Therefore the Tories had been dismissed and the Cabinet Council</p>
<p>had been composed entirely of Whigs. A few years later</p>
<p>when the Whigs lost their power in the House of Commons, the</p>
<p>king, for the sake of convenience, was obliged to look for his</p>
<p>support among the leading Tories. Until his death in 1702,</p>
<p>William was too busy fighting Louis of France to bother much</p>
<p>about the government of England. Practically all important</p>
<p>affairs had been left to his Cabinet Council. When William&#x27;s</p>
<p>sister-in-law, Anne, succeeded him in 1702 this condition of</p>
<p>affairs continued. When she died in 1714 (and unfortunately</p>
<p>not a single one of her seventeen children survived her) the</p>
<p>throne went to George I of the House of Hanover, the son of</p>
<p>Sophie, grand-daughter of James I.</p>
<p>This somewhat rustic monarch, who never learned a word</p>
<p>of English, was entirely lost in the complicated mazes of England&#x27;s</p>
<p>political arrangements. He left everything to his Cabinet</p>
<p>Council and kept away from their meetings, which bored</p>
<p>him as he did not understand a single sentence. In this way</p>
<p>the Cabinet got into the habit of ruling England and Scotland</p>
<p>(whose Parliament had been joined to that of England</p>
<p>in 1707) without bothering the King, who was apt to spend</p>
<p>a great deal of his time on the continent.</p>
<p>During the reign of George I and George II, a succession of</p>
<p>great Whigs (of whom one, Sir Robert Walpole, held office for</p>
<p>twenty-one years) formed the Cabinet Council of the King.</p>
<p>Their leader was finally recognised as the official leader not</p>
<p>only of the actual Cabinet but also of the majority party in</p>
<p>power in Parliament. The attempts of George III to take</p>
<p>matters into his own hands and not to leave the actual business</p>
<p>of government to his Cabinet were so disastrous that</p>
<p>they were never repeated. And from the earliest years of the</p>
<p>eighteenth century on, England enjoyed representative government,</p>
<p>with a responsible ministry which conducted the affairs</p>
<p>of the land.</p>
<p>To be quite true, this government did not represent all</p>
<p>classes of society. Less than one man in a dozen had the right</p>
<p>to vote. But it was the foundation for the modern representative</p>
<p>form of government. In a quiet and orderly fashion it</p>
<p>took the power away from the King and placed it in the hands</p>
<p>of an ever increasing number of popular representatives. It did</p>
<p>not bring the millenium to England, but it saved that country</p>
<p>from most of the revolutionary outbreaks which proved so</p>
<p>disastrous to the European continent in the eighteenth and</p>
<p>nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>THE BALANCE OF POWER</p>
<p>IN FRANCE ON THE OTHER HAND THE ``DIVINE</p>
<p>RIGHT OF KINGS&#x27;&#x27; CONTINUED WITH</p>
<p>GREATER POMP AND SPLENDOUR THAN</p>
<p>EVER BEFORE AND THE AMBITION OF</p>
<p>THE RULER WAS ONLY TEMPERED BY</p>
<p>THE NEWLY INVENTED LAW OF THE</p>
<p>``BALANCE OF POWER&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>As a contrast to the previous chapter, let me tell you what</p>
<p>happened in France during the years when the English people</p>
<p>were fighting for their liberty. The happy combination</p>
<p>of the right man in the right country at the right moment is very</p>
<p>rare in History. Louis XIV was a realisation of this ideal, as</p>
<p>far as France was concerned, but the rest of Europe would</p>
<p>have been happier without him.</p>
<p>The country over which the young king was called to rule</p>
<p>was the most populous and the most brilliant nation of that</p>
<p>day. Louis came to the throne when Mazarin and Richelieu,</p>
<p>the two great Cardinals, had just hammered the ancient French</p>
<p>Kingdom into the most strongly centralised state of the seventeenth</p>
<p>century. He was himself a man of extraordinary ability.</p>
<p>We, the people of the twentieth century, are still</p>
<p>surrounded by the memories of the glorious age of the Sun King.</p>
<p>Our social life is based upon the perfection of manners and the</p>
<p>elegance of expression attained at the court of Louis. In</p>
<p>international and diplomatic relations, French is still the official</p>
<p>language of diplomacy and international gatherings because</p>
<p>two centuries ago it reached a polished elegance and a purity</p>
<p>of expression which no other tongue had as yet been able to</p>
<p>equal. The theatre of King Louis still teaches us lessons</p>
<p>which we are only too slow in learning. During his reign the</p>
<p>French Academy (an invention of Richelieu) came to occupy</p>
<p>a position in the world of letters which other countries have</p>
<p>flattered by their imitation. We might continue this list for</p>
<p>many pages. It is no matter of mere chance that our modern</p>
<p>bill-of-fare is printed in French. The very difficult art of</p>
<p>decent cooking, one of the highest expressions of civilisation,</p>
<p>was first practiced for the benefit of the great Monarch. The</p>
<p>age of Louis XIV was a time of splendour and grace which can</p>
<p>still teach us a lot.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this brilliant picture has another side which</p>
<p>was far less encouraging. Glory abroad too often means</p>
<p>misery at home, and France was no exception to this rule</p>
<p>Louis XIV succeeded his father in the year 1643. He died in</p>
<p>the year 1715. That means that the government of France</p>
<p>was in the hands of one single man for seventy-two years,</p>
<p>almost two whole generations.</p>
<p>It will be well to get a firm grasp of this idea, ``one single</p>
<p>man.&#x27;&#x27; Louis was the first of a long list of monarchs who in</p>
<p>many countries established that particular form of highly efficient</p>
<p>autocracy which we call ``enlightened despotism.&#x27;&#x27; He</p>
<p>did not like kings who merely played at being rulers and</p>
<p>turned official affairs into a pleasant picnic. The Kings of</p>
<p>that enlightened age worked harder than any of their subjects.</p>
<p>They got up earlier and went to bed later than anybody else,</p>
<p>and felt their ``divine responsibility&#x27;&#x27; quite as strongly as their</p>
<p>``divine right&#x27;&#x27; which allowed them to rule without consulting</p>
<p>their subjects.</p>
<p>Of course, the king could not attend to everything in person.</p>
<p>He was obliged to surround himself with a few helpers</p>
<p>and councillors. One or two generals, some experts upon foreign</p>
<p>politics, a few clever financiers and economists would do</p>
<p>for this purpose. But these dignitaries could act only through</p>
<p>their Sovereign. They had no individual existence. To the</p>
<p>mass of the people, the Sovereign actually represented in his</p>
<p>own sacred person the government of their country. The</p>
<p>glory of the common fatherland became the glory of a single</p>
<p>dynasty. It meant the exact opposite of our own American</p>
<p>ideal. France was ruled of and by and for the House of Bourbon.</p>
<p>The disadvantages of such a system are clear. The King</p>
<p>grew to be everything. Everybody else grew to be nothing at</p>
<p>all. The old and useful nobility was gradually forced to give</p>
<p>up its former shares in the government of the provinces. A little</p>
<p>Royal bureaucrat, his fingers splashed with ink, sitting behind</p>
<p>the greenish windows of a government building in faraway</p>
<p>Paris, now performed the task which a hundred years</p>
<p>before had been the duty of the feudal Lord. The feudal Lord,</p>
<p>deprived of all work, moved to Paris to amuse himself as best</p>
<p>he could at the court. Soon his estates began to suffer from</p>
<p>that very dangerous economic sickness, known as ``Absentee</p>
<p>Landlordism.&#x27;&#x27; Within a single generation, the industrious</p>
<p>and useful feudal administrators had become the well-mannered</p>
<p>but quite useless loafers of the court of Versailles.</p>
<p>Louis was ten years old when the peace of Westphalia was</p>
<p>concluded and the House of Habsburg, as a result of the</p>
<p>Thirty Years War, lost its predominant position in Europe.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that a man with his ambition should use so</p>
<p>favourable a moment to gain for his own dynasty the honours</p>
<p>which had formerly been held by the Habsburgs. In the year</p>
<p>1660 Louis had married Maria Theresa, daughter of the King</p>
<p>of Spain. Soon afterward, his father-in-law, Philip IV, one</p>
<p>of the half-witted Spanish Habsburgs, died. At once Louis</p>
<p>claimed the Spanish Netherlands (Belgium) as part of his</p>
<p>wife&#x27;s dowry. Such an acquisition would have been disastrous</p>
<p>to the peace of Europe, and would have threatened the safety</p>
<p>of the Protestant states. Under the leadership of Jan de Witt,</p>
<p>Raadpensionaris or Foreign Minister of the United Seven</p>
<p>Netherlands, the first great international alliance, the Triple</p>
<p>Alliance of Sweden, England and Holland, of the year 1661,</p>
<p>was concluded. It did not last long. With money and fair</p>
<p>promises Louis bought up both King Charles and the Swedish</p>
<p>Estates. Holland was betrayed by her allies and was left to</p>
<p>her own fate. In the year 1672 the French invaded the low</p>
<p>countries. They marched to the heart of the country. For a</p>
<p>second time the dikes were opened and the Royal Sun of</p>
<p>France set amidst the mud of the Dutch marshes. The peace</p>
<p>of Nimwegen which was concluded in 1678 settled nothing but</p>
<p>merely anticipated another war.</p>
<p>A second war of aggression from 1689 to 1697, ending with</p>
<p>the Peace of Ryswick, also failed to give Louis that position in</p>
<p>the affairs of Europe to which he aspired. His old enemy,</p>
<p>Jan de Witt, had been murdered by the Dutch rabble, but his</p>
<p>successor, William III (whom you met in the last chapter),</p>
<p>had checkmated all efforts of Louis to make France the ruler of</p>
<p>Europe.</p>
<p>The great war for the Spanish succession, begun in the</p>
<p>year 1701, immediately after the death of Charles II, the last</p>
<p>of the Spanish Habsburgs, and ended in 1713 by the Peace</p>
<p>of Utrecht, remained equally undecided, but it had ruined the</p>
<p>treasury of Louis. On land the French king had been victorious,</p>
<p>but the navies of England and Holland had spoiled all</p>
<p>hope for an ultimate French victory; besides the long struggle</p>
<p>had given birth to a new and fundamental principle of international</p>
<p>politics, which thereafter made it impossible for one</p>
<p>single nation to rule the whole of Europe or the whole of the</p>
<p>world for any length of time.</p>
<p>That was the so-called ``balance of power.&#x27;&#x27; It was not a</p>
<p>written law but for three centuries it has been obeyed as closely</p>
<p>as are the laws of nature. The people who originated the idea</p>
<p>maintained that Europe, in its nationalistic stage of development,</p>
<p>could only survive when there should be an absolute balance</p>
<p>of the many conflicting interests of the entire continent.</p>
<p>No single power or single dynasty must ever be allowed to</p>
<p>dominate the others. During the Thirty Years War, the</p>
<p>Habsburgs had been the victims of the application of this law.</p>
<p>They, however, had been unconscious victims. The issues during</p>
<p>that struggle were so clouded in a haze of religious strife</p>
<p>that we do not get a very clear view of the main tendencies</p>
<p>of that great conflict. But from that time on, we begin to see</p>
<p>how cold, economic considerations and calculations prevail in</p>
<p>all matters of international importance. We discover the</p>
<p>development of a new type of statesman, the statesman with the</p>
<p>personal feelings of the slide-rule and the cash-register. Jan</p>
<p>de Witt was the first successful exponent of this new school</p>
<p>of politics. William III was the first great pupil. And Louis</p>
<p>XIV with all his fame and glory, was the first conscious victim.</p>
<p>There have been many others since.</p>
<p>THE RISE OF RUSSIA</p>
<p>THE STORY OF THE MYSTERIOUS MOSCOVITE</p>
<p>EMPIRE WHICH SUDDENLY BURST UPON</p>
<p>THE GRAND POLITICAL STAGE OF EUROPE</p>
<p>IN the year 1492, as you know, Columbus discovered America.</p>
<p>Early in the year, a Tyrolese by the name of Schnups,</p>
<p>travelling as the head of a scientific expedition for the</p>
<p>Archbishop of Tyrol, and provided with the best letters</p>
<p>of introduction and excellent credit tried to reach the mythical</p>
<p>town of Moscow. He did not succeed. When he reached the</p>
<p>frontiers of this vast Moscovite state which was vaguely supposed</p>
<p>to exist in the extreme Eastern part of Europe, he was</p>
<p>firmly turned back. No foreigners were wanted. And</p>
<p>Schnups went to visit the heathen Turk in Constantinople, in</p>
<p>order that he might have something to report to his clerical</p>
<p>master when he came back from his explorations.</p>
<p>Sixty-one years later, Richard Chancellor, trying to discover</p>
<p>the North-eastern passage to the Indies, and blown by</p>
<p>an ill wind into the White Sea, reached the mouth of the Dwina</p>
<p>and found the Moscovite village of Kholmogory, a few hours</p>
<p>from the spot where in 1584 the town of Archangel was founded.</p>
<p>This time the foreign visitors were requested to come</p>
<p>to Moscow and show themselves to the Grand Duke. They</p>
<p>went and returned to England with the first commercial treaty</p>
<p>ever concluded between Russia and the western world. Other</p>
<p>nations soon followed and something became known of this</p>
<p>mysterious land.</p>
<p>Geographically, Russia is a vast plain. The Ural mountains</p>
<p>are low and form no barrier against invaders. The</p>
<p>rivers are broad but often shallow. It was an ideal territory for</p>
<p>nomads.</p>
<p>While the Roman Empire was founded, grew in power and</p>
<p>disappeared again, Slavic tribes, who had long since left their</p>
<p>homes in Central Asia, wandered aimlessly through the forests</p>
<p>and plains of the region between the Dniester and Dnieper</p>
<p>rivers. The Greeks had sometimes met these Slavs and a few</p>
<p>travellers of the third and fourth centuries mention them.</p>
<p>Otherwise they were as little known as were the Nevada Indians</p>
<p>in the year 1800.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the peace of these primitive peoples, a</p>
<p>very convenient trade-route ran through their country. This</p>
<p>was the main road from northern Europe to Constantinople.</p>
<p>It followed the coast of the Baltic until the Neva was reached.</p>
<p>Then it crossed Lake Ladoga and went southward along the</p>
<p>Volkhov river. Then through Lake Ilmen and up the small</p>
<p>Lovat river. Then there was a short portage until the Dnieper</p>
<p>was reached. Then down the Dnieper into the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The Norsemen knew of this road at a very early date. In</p>
<p>the ninth century they began to settle in northern Russia, just</p>
<p>as other Norsemen were laying the foundation for independent</p>
<p>states in Germany and France. But in the year 862, three</p>
<p>Norsemen, brothers, crossed the Baltic and founded three small</p>
<p>dynasties. Of the three brothers, only one, Rurik, lived for a</p>
<p>number of years. He took possession of the territory of his</p>
<p>brothers, and twenty years after the arrival of this first</p>
<p>Norseman, a Slavic state had been established with Kiev as its</p>
<p>capital.</p>
<p>From Kiev to the Black Sea is a short distance. Soon the</p>
<p>existence of an organised Slavic State became known in</p>
<p>Constantinople. This meant a new field for the zealous</p>
<p>missionaries of the Christian faith. Byzantine monks followed the</p>
<p>Dnieper on their way northward and soon reached the heart of</p>
<p>Russia. They found the people worshipping strange gods</p>
<p>who were supposed to dwell in woods and rivers and in mountain</p>
<p>caves. They taught them the story of Jesus. There was</p>
<p>no competition from the side of Roman missionaries. These</p>
<p>good men were too busy educating the heathen Teutons to</p>
<p>bother about the distant Slavs. Hence Russia received its religion</p>
<p>and its alphabet and its first ideas of art and architecture</p>
<p>from the Byzantine monks and as the Byzantine empire (a</p>
<p>relic of the eastern Roman empire) had become very oriental</p>
<p>and had lost many of its European traits, the Russians suffered</p>
<p>in consequence.</p>
<p>Politically speaking these new states of the great Russian</p>
<p>plains did not fare well. It was the Norse habit to divide</p>
<p>every inheritance equally among all the sons. No sooner had</p>
<p>a small state been founded but it was broken up among eight</p>
<p>or nine heirs who in turn left their territory to an ever increasing</p>
<p>number of descendants. It was inevitable that these small</p>
<p>competing states should quarrel among themselves. Anarchy</p>
<p>was the order of the day. And when the red glow of the eastern</p>
<p>horizon told the people of the threatened invasion of a savage</p>
<p>Asiatic tribe, the little states were too weak and too divided</p>
<p>to render any sort of defence against this terrible enemy.</p>
<p>It was in the year 1224 that the first great Tartar invasion</p>
<p>took place and that the hordes of Jenghiz Khan, the conqueror</p>
<p>of China, Bokhara, Tashkent and Turkestan made their first</p>
<p>appearance in the west. The Slavic armies were beaten near</p>
<p>the Kalka river and Russia was at the mercy of the Mongolians.</p>
<p>Just as suddenly as they had come they disappeared.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, in 1237, however, they returned. In less</p>
<p>than five years they conquered every part of the vast Russian</p>
<p>plains. Until the year 1380 when Dmitry Donskoi, Grand</p>
<p>Duke of Moscow, beat them on the plains of Kulikovo, the</p>
<p>Tartars were the masters of the Russian people.</p>
<p>All in all, it took the Russians two centuries to deliver</p>
<p>themselves from this yoke. For a yoke it was and a most</p>
<p>offensive and objectionable one. It turned the Slavic peasants</p>
<p>into miserable slaves. No Russian could hope to survive un-</p>
<p>less he was willing to creep before a dirty little yellow man who</p>
<p>sat in a tent somewhere in the heart of the steppes of southern</p>
<p>Russia and spat at him. It deprived the mass of the people of</p>
<p>all feeling of honour and independence. It made hunger and</p>
<p>misery and maltreatment and personal abuse the normal state</p>
<p>of human existence. Until at last the average Russian, were he</p>
<p>peasant or nobleman, went about his business like a neglected</p>
<p>dog who has been beaten so often that his spirit has been broken</p>
<p>and he dare not wag his tail without permission.</p>
<p>There was no escape. The horsemen of the Tartar Khan</p>
<p>were fast and merciless. The endless prairie did not give a</p>
<p>man a chance to cross into the safe territory of his neighbour.</p>
<p>He must keep quiet and bear what his yellow master decided</p>
<p>to inflict upon him or run the risk of death. Of course, Europe</p>
<p>might have interfered. But Europe was engaged upon business</p>
<p>of its own, fighting the quarrels between the Pope and</p>
<p>the emperor or suppressing this or that or the other heresy.</p>
<p>And so Europe left the Slav to his fate, and forced him to</p>
<p>work out his own salvation.</p>
<p>The final saviour of Russia was one of the many small states,</p>
<p>founded by the early Norse rulers. It was situated in the heart</p>
<p>of the Russian plain. Its capital, Moscow, was upon a steep</p>
<p>hill on the banks of the Moskwa river. This little principality,</p>
<p>by dint of pleasing the Tartar (when it was necessary to</p>
<p>please), and opposing him (when it was safe to do so), had,</p>
<p>during the middle of the fourteenth century made itself the</p>
<p>leader of a new national life. It must be remembered that the</p>
<p>Tartars were wholly deficient in constructive political ability.</p>
<p>They could only destroy. Their chief aim in conquering new</p>
<p>territories was to obtain revenue. To get this revenue in the</p>
<p>form of taxes, it was necessary to allow certain remnants of</p>
<p>the old political organization to continue. Hence there were</p>
<p>many little towns, surviving by the grace of the Great Khan,</p>
<p>that they might act as tax-gatherers and rob their neighbours</p>
<p>for the benefit of the Tartar treasury.</p>
<p>The state of Moscow, growing fat at the expense of the</p>
<p>surrounding territory, finally became strong enough to risk</p>
<p>open rebellion against its masters, the Tartars. It was successful</p>
<p>and its fame as the leader in the cause of Russian independence</p>
<p>made Moscow the natural centre for all those who</p>
<p>still believed in a better future for the Slavic race. In the year</p>
<p>1458, Constantinople was taken by the Turks. Ten years</p>
<p>later, under the rule of Ivan III, Moscow informed the</p>
<p>western world that the Slavic state laid claim to the worldly</p>
<p>and spiritual inheritance of the lost Byzantine Empire, and</p>
<p>such traditions of the Roman empire as had survived in</p>
<p>Constantinople. A generation afterwards, under Ivan the Terrible,</p>
<p>the grand dukes of Moscow were strong enough to adopt the</p>
<p>title of Caesar, or Tsar, and to demand recognition by the western</p>
<p>powers of Europe.</p>
<p>In the year 1598, with Feodor the First, the old Muscovite</p>
<p>dynasty, descendants of the original Norseman Rurik, came to</p>
<p>an end. For the next seven years, a Tartar half-breed, by the</p>
<p>name of Boris Godunow, reigned as Tsar. It was during</p>
<p>this period that the future destiny of the large masses of the</p>
<p>Russian people was decided. This Empire was rich in land</p>
<p>but very poor in money. There was no trade and there were</p>
<p>no factories. Its few cities were dirty villages. It was composed</p>
<p>of a strong central government and a vast number of</p>
<p>illiterate peasants. This government, a mixture of Slavic,</p>
<p>Norse, Byzantine and Tartar influences, recognised nothing</p>
<p>beyond the interest of the state. To defend this state, it</p>
<p>needed an army. To gather the taxes, which were necessary</p>
<p>to pay the soldiers, it needed civil servants. To pay these many</p>
<p>officials it needed land. In the vast wilderness on the east</p>
<p>and west there was a sufficient supply of this commodity. But</p>
<p>land without a few labourers to till the fields and tend the</p>
<p>cattle, has no value. Therefore the old nomadic peasants</p>
<p>were robbed of one privilege after the other, until finally, during</p>
<p>the first year of the sixteenth century, they were formally</p>
<p>made a part of the soil upon which they lived. The Russian</p>
<p>peasants ceased to be free men. They became serfs or slaves</p>
<p>and they remained serfs until the year 1861, when their fate</p>
<p>had become so terrible that they were beginning to die out.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth century, this new state with its growing</p>
<p>territory which was spreading quickly into Siberia, had become</p>
<p>a force with which the rest of Europe was obliged to</p>
<p>reckon. In 1618, after the death of Boris Godunow, the</p>
<p>Russian nobles had elected one of their own number to be</p>
<p>Tsar. He was Michael, the son of Feodor, of the Moscow family</p>
<p>of Romanow who lived in a little house just outside the</p>
<p>Kremlin.</p>
<p>In the year 1672 his great-grandson, Peter, the son of another</p>
<p>Feodor, was born. When the child was ten years old,</p>
<p>his step-sister Sophia took possession of the Russian throne.</p>
<p>The little boy was allowed to spend his days in the suburbs of</p>
<p>the national capital, where the foreigners lived. Surrounded</p>
<p>by Scotch barkeepers, Dutch traders, Swiss apothecaries, Italian</p>
<p>barbers, French dancing teachers and German school-masters,</p>
<p>the young prince obtained a first but rather extraordinary</p>
<p>impression of that far-away and mysterious Europe where</p>
<p>things were done differently.</p>
<p>When he was seventeen years old, he suddenly pushed</p>
<p>Sister Sophia from the throne. Peter himself became the ruler</p>
<p>of Russia. He was not contented with being the Tsar of a</p>
<p>semi-barbarous and half-Asiatic people. He must be the sovereign</p>
<p>head of a civilised nation. To change Russia overnight</p>
<p>from a Byzantine-Tartar state into a European empire was no</p>
<p>small undertaking. It needed strong hands and a capable</p>
<p>head. Peter possessed both. In the year 1698, the great</p>
<p>operation of grafting Modern Europe upon Ancient Russia was</p>
<p>performed. The patient did not die. But he never got over</p>
<p>the shock, as the events of the last five years have shown very</p>
<p>plainly.</p>
<p>RUSSIA vs. SWEDEN</p>
<p>RUSSIA AND SWEDEN FIGHT MANY WARS TO</p>
<p>DECIDE WHO SHALL BE THE LEADING</p>
<p>POWER OF NORTH-EASTERN EUROPE</p>
<p>IN the year 1698, Tsar Peter set forth upon his first</p>
<p>voyage to western Europe. He travelled by way of Berlin and</p>
<p>went to Holland and to England. As a child he had almost</p>
<p>been drowned sailing a homemade boat in the duck pond of</p>
<p>his father&#x27;s country home. This passion for water remained</p>
<p>with him to the end of his life. In a practical way it showed</p>
<p>itself in his wish to give his land-locked domains access to</p>
<p>the open sea.</p>
<p>While the unpopular and harsh young ruler was away</p>
<p>from home, the friends of the old Russian ways in Moscow set</p>
<p>to work to undo all his reforms. A sudden rebellion among</p>
<p>his life-guards, the Streltsi regiment, forced Peter to hasten</p>
<p>home by the fast mail. He appointed himself executioner-in-</p>
<p>chief and the Streltsi were hanged and quartered and killed to</p>
<p>the last man. Sister Sophia, who had been the head of the</p>
<p>rebellion, was locked up in a cloister and the rule of Peter be-</p>
<p>gan in earnest. This scene was repeated in the year 1716 when</p>
<p>Peter had gone on his second western trip. That time the</p>
<p>reactionaries followed the leadership of Peter&#x27;s half-witted</p>
<p>son, Alexis. Again the Tsar returned in great haste. Alexis</p>
<p>was beaten to death in his prison cell and the friends of the</p>
<p>old fashioned Byzantine ways marched thousands of dreary</p>
<p>miles to their final destination in the Siberian lead mines.</p>
<p>After that, no further outbreaks of popular discontent took</p>
<p>place. Until the time of his death, Peter could reform in peace.</p>
<p>It is not easy to give you a list of his reforms in chronological</p>
<p>order. The Tsar worked with furious haste. He followed</p>
<p>no system. He issued his decrees with such rapidity that it is</p>
<p>difficult to keep count. Peter seemed to feel that everything</p>
<p>that had ever happened before was entirely wrong. The whole</p>
<p>of Russia therefore must be changed within the shortest possible</p>
<p>time. When he died he left behind a well-trained army of</p>
<p>200,000 men and a navy of fifty ships. The old system of government</p>
<p>had been abolished over night. The Duma, or convention</p>
<p>of Nobles, had been dismissed and in its stead, the Tsar</p>
<p>had surrounded himself with an advisory board of state officials,</p>
<p>called the Senate.</p>
<p>Russia was divided into eight large ``governments&#x27;&#x27; or provinces.</p>
<p>Roads were constructed. Towns were built. Industries</p>
<p>were created wherever it pleased the Tsar, without any regard</p>
<p>for the presence of raw material. Canals were dug and mines</p>
<p>were opened in the mountains of the east. In this land of illiterates,</p>
<p>schools were founded and establishments of higher learning,</p>
<p>together with Universities and hospitals and professional</p>
<p>schools. Dutch naval engineers and tradesmen and artisans</p>
<p>from all over the world were encouraged to move to Russia.</p>
<p>Printing shops were established, but all books must be first read</p>
<p>by the imperial censors. The duties of each class of society</p>
<p>were carefully written down in a new law and the entire system</p>
<p>of civil and criminal laws was gathered into a series of printed</p>
<p>volumes. The old Russian costumes were abolished by Imperial</p>
<p>decree, and policemen, armed with scissors, watching</p>
<p>all the country roads, changed the long-haired Russian mou-</p>
<p>jiks suddenly into a pleasing imitation of smooth-shaven west.</p>
<p>Europeans.</p>
<p>In religious matters, the Tsar tolerated no division of</p>
<p>power. There must be no chance of a rivalry between an</p>
<p>Emperor and a Pope as had happened in Europe. In the year</p>
<p>1721, Peter made himself head of the Russian Church. The</p>
<p>Patriarchate of Moscow was abolished and the Holy Synod</p>
<p>made its appearance as the highest source of authority in all</p>
<p>matters of the Established Church.</p>
<p>Since, however, these many reforms could not be success-</p>
<p>ful while the old Russian elements had a rallying point in the</p>
<p>town of Moscow, Peter decided to move his government to a</p>
<p>new capital. Amidst the unhealthy marshes of the Baltic Sea</p>
<p>the Tsar built this new city. He began to reclaim the land in</p>
<p>the year 1703. Forty thousand peasants worked for years</p>
<p>to lay the foundations for this Imperial city. The Swedes</p>
<p>attacked Peter and tried to destroy his town and illness and</p>
<p>misery killed tens of thousands of the peasants. But the work</p>
<p>was continued, winter and summer, and the ready-made town</p>
<p>soon began to grow. In the year 1712, it was officially de-</p>
<p>clared to be the ``Imperial Residence.&#x27;&#x27; A dozen years later</p>
<p>it had 75,000 inhabitants. Twice a year the whole city was</p>
<p>flooded by the Neva. But the terrific will-power of the Tsar</p>
<p>created dykes and canals and the floods ceased to do harm.</p>
<p>When Peter died in 1725 he was the owner of the largest city</p>
<p>in northern Europe.</p>
<p>Of course, this sudden growth of so dangerous a rival had</p>
<p>been a source of great worry to all the neighbours. From his</p>
<p>side, Peter had watched with interest the many adventures of</p>
<p>his Baltic rival, the kingdom of Sweden. In the year 1654,</p>
<p>Christina, the only daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, the hero</p>
<p>of the Thirty Years War, had renounced the throne and had</p>
<p>gone to Rome to end her days as a devout Catholic. A Protestant</p>
<p>nephew of Gustavus Adolphus had succeeded the last</p>
<p>Queen of the House of Vasa. Under Charles X and Charles</p>
<p>XI, the new dynasty had brought Sweden to its highest point</p>
<p>of development. But in 1697, Charles XI died suddenly and</p>
<p>was succeeded by a boy of fifteen, Charles XII.</p>
<p>This was the moment for which many of the northern states</p>
<p>had waited. During the great religious wars of the seventeenth</p>
<p>century, Sweden had grown at the expense of her neighbours.</p>
<p>The time had come, so the owners thought, to balance the account.</p>
<p>At once war broke out between Russia, Poland, Denmark</p>
<p>and Saxony on the one side, and Sweden on the other.</p>
<p>The raw and untrained armies of Peter were disastrously beaten</p>
<p>by Charles in the famous battle of Narva in November of</p>
<p>the year 1700. Then Charles, one of the most interesting military</p>
<p>geniuses of that century, turned against his other enemies</p>
<p>and for nine years he hacked and burned his way through the</p>
<p>villages and cities of Poland, Saxony, Denmark and the Baltic</p>
<p>provinces, while Peter drilled and trained his soldiers in distant</p>
<p>Russia.</p>
<p>As a result, in the year 1709, in the battle of Poltawa, the</p>
<p>Moscovites destroyed the exhausted armies of Sweden. Charles</p>
<p>continued to be a highly picturesque figure, a wonderful hero</p>
<p>of romance, but in his vain attempt to have his revenge, he</p>
<p>ruined his own country. In the year 1718, he was accidentally</p>
<p>killed or assassinated (we do not know which) and when peace</p>
<p>was made in 1721, in the town of Nystadt, Sweden had lost all</p>
<p>of her former Baltic possessions except Finland. The new</p>
<p>Russian state, created by Peter, had become the leading power</p>
<p>of northern Europe. But already a new rival was on the</p>
<p>way. The Prussian state was taking shape.</p>
<p>THE RISE OF PRUSSIA</p>
<p>THE EXTRAORDINARY RISE OF A LITTLE</p>
<p>STATE IN A DREARY PART OF NORTHERN</p>
<p>GERMANY, CALLED PRUSSIA</p>
<p>THE history of Prussia is the history of a frontier district.</p>
<p>In the ninth century, Charlemagne had transferred the old</p>
<p>centre of civilisation from the Mediterranean to the wild regions</p>
<p>of northwestern Europe. His Frankish soldiers had pushed</p>
<p>the frontier of Europe further and further towards the east.</p>
<p>They had conquered many lands from the heathenish Slavs and</p>
<p>Lithuanians who were living in the plain between the Baltic</p>
<p>Sea and the Carpathian Mountains, and the Franks administered</p>
<p>those outlying districts just as the United States used</p>
<p>to administer her territories before they achieved the dignity</p>
<p>of statehood.</p>
<p>The frontier state of Brandenburg had been originally</p>
<p>founded by Charlemagne to defend his eastern possessions</p>
<p>against raids of the wild Saxon tribes. The Wends, a Slavic</p>
<p>tribe which inhabited that region, were subjugated during the</p>
<p>tenth century and their market-place, by the name of Brennabor,</p>
<p>became the centre of and gave its name to the new province</p>
<p>of Brandenburg.</p>
<p>During the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth</p>
<p>centuries, a succession of noble families exercised the functions of</p>
<p>imperial governor in this frontier state. Finally in the</p>
<p>fifteenth century, the House of Hohenzollern made its appear-</p>
<p>ance, and as Electors of Brandenburg, commenced to change a</p>
<p>sandy and forlorn frontier territory into one of the most efficient</p>
<p>empires of the modern world.</p>
<p>These Hohenzollerns, who have just been removed from</p>
<p>the historical stage by the combined forces of Europe and</p>
<p>America, came originally from southern Germany. They were</p>
<p>of very humble origin. In the twelfth century a certain Frederick</p>
<p>of Hohenzollern had made a lucky marriage and had been</p>
<p>appointed keeper of the castle of Nuremberg. His descendants</p>
<p>had used every chance and every opportunity to improve their</p>
<p>power and after several centuries of watchful grabbing, they</p>
<p>had been appointed to the dignity of Elector, the name given to</p>
<p>those sovereign princes who were supposed to elect the Emperors</p>
<p>of the old German Empire. During the Reformation,</p>
<p>they had taken the side of the Protestants and the early</p>
<p>seventeenth century found them among the most powerful of the</p>
<p>north German princes.</p>
<p>During the Thirty Years War, both Protestants and</p>
<p>Catholics had plundered Brandenburg and Prussia with equal</p>
<p>zeal. But under Frederick William, the Great Elector, the</p>
<p>damage was quickly repaired and by a wise and careful use of</p>
<p>all the economic and intellectual forces of the country, a state</p>
<p>was founded in which there was practically no waste.</p>
<p>Modern Prussia, a state in which the individual and his</p>
<p>wishes and aspirations have been entirely absorbed by the</p>
<p>interests of the community as a whole this Prussia dates back</p>
<p>to the father of Frederick the Great. Frederick William I was</p>
<p>a hard working, parsimonious Prussian sergeant, with a great</p>
<p>love for bar-room stories and strong Dutch tobacco, an intense</p>
<p>dislike of all frills and feathers, (especially if they were of</p>
<p>French origin,) and possessed of but one idea. That idea was</p>
<p>Duty. Severe with himself, he tolerated no weakness in his</p>
<p>subjects, whether they be generals or common soldiers. The</p>
<p>relation between himself and his son Frederick was never cordial,</p>
<p>to say the least. The boorish manners of the father offended</p>
<p>the finer spirit of the son. The son&#x27;s love for French</p>
<p>manners, literature, philosophy and music was rejected by the</p>
<p>father as a manifestation of sissy-ness. There followed a terrible</p>
<p>outbreak between these two strange temperaments. Frederick</p>
<p>tried to escape to England. He was caught and court-</p>
<p>martialed and forced to witness the decapitation of his best</p>
<p>friend who had tried to help him. Thereupon as part of his</p>
<p>punishment, the young prince was sent to a little fortress</p>
<p>somewhere in the provinces to be taught the details of his future</p>
<p>business of being a king. It proved a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>When Frederick came to the throne in 1740, he knew how his</p>
<p>country was managed from the birth certificate of a pauper&#x27;s</p>
<p>son to the minutest detail of a complicated annual Budget.</p>
<p>As an author, especially in his book called the ``Anti-</p>
<p>Macchiavelli,&#x27;&#x27; Frederick had expressed his contempt for the</p>
<p>political creed of the ancient Florentine historian, who had</p>
<p>advised his princely pupils to lie and cheat whenever it was</p>
<p>necessary to do so for the benefit of their country. The ideal</p>
<p>ruler in Frederick&#x27;s volume was the first servant of his people,</p>
<p>the enlightened despot after the example of Louis XIV. In</p>
<p>practice, however, Frederick, while working for his people</p>
<p>twenty hours a day, tolerated no one to be near him as a</p>
<p>counsellor. His ministers were superior clerks. Prussia was his</p>
<p>private possession, to be treated according to his own wishes.</p>
<p>And nothing was allowed to interfere with the interest of the</p>
<p>state.</p>
<p>In the year 1740 the Emperor Charles VI, of Austria,</p>
<p>died. He had tried to make the position of his only daughter,</p>
<p>Maria Theresa, secure through a solemn treaty, written black</p>
<p>on white, upon a large piece of parchment. But no sooner had</p>
<p>the old emperor been deposited in the ancestral crypt of the</p>
<p>Habsburg family, than the armies of Frederick were marching</p>
<p>towards the Austrian frontier to occupy that part of Silesia for</p>
<p>which (together with almost everything else in central Europe)</p>
<p>Prussia clamored, on account of some ancient and very</p>
<p>doubtful rights of claim. In a number of wars, Frederick</p>
<p>conquered all of Silesia, and although he was often very near</p>
<p>defeat, he maintained himself in his newly acquired territories</p>
<p>against all Austrian counter-attacks.</p>
<p>Europe took due notice of this sudden appearance of a</p>
<p>very powerful new state. In the eighteenth century, the Germans</p>
<p>were a people who had been ruined by the great religious</p>
<p>wars and who were not held in high esteem by any one. Frederick,</p>
<p>by an effort as sudden and quite as terrific as that of</p>
<p>Peter of Russia, changed this attitude of contempt into one</p>
<p>of fear. The internal affairs of Prussia were arranged so</p>
<p>skillfully that the subjects had less reason for complaint than</p>
<p>elsewhere. The treasury showed an annual surplus instead of a</p>
<p>deficit. Torture was abolished. The judiciary system was</p>
<p>improved. Good roads and good schools and good universities,</p>
<p>together with a scrupulously honest administration, made the</p>
<p>people feel that whatever services were demanded of them,</p>
<p>they (to speak the vernacular) got their money&#x27;s worth.</p>
<p>After having been for several centuries the battle field of</p>
<p>the French and the Austrians and the Swedes and the Danes</p>
<p>and the Poles, Germany, encouraged by the example of Prussia,</p>
<p>began to regain self-confidence. And this was the work of</p>
<p>the little old man, with his hook-nose and his old uniforms covered</p>
<p>with snuff, who said very funny but very unpleasant things</p>
<p>about his neighbours, and who played the scandalous game of</p>
<p>eighteenth century diplomacy without any regard for the truth,</p>
<p>provided he could gain something by his lies. This in spite of</p>
<p>his book, ``Anti-Macchiavelli.&#x27;&#x27; In the year 1786 the end</p>
<p>came. His friends were all gone. Children he had never had.</p>
<p>He died alone, tended by a single servant and his faithful</p>
<p>dogs, whom he loved better than human beings because, as he</p>
<p>said, they were never ungrateful and remained true to their</p>
<p>friends.</p>
<p>THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM</p>
<p>HOW THE NEWLY FOUNDED NATIONAL OR</p>
<p>DYNASTIC STATES OF EUROPE TRIED TO</p>
<p>MAKE THEMSELVES RICH AND WHAT WAS</p>
<p>MEANT BY THE MERCANTILE SYSTEM</p>
<p>WE have seen how, during the sixteenth and the seventeenth</p>
<p>centuries, the states of our modern world began to take shape.</p>
<p>Their origins were different in almost every case. Some had</p>
<p>been the result of the deliberate effort of a single king. Others</p>
<p>had happened by chance. Still others had been the result of</p>
<p>favourable natural geographic boundaries. But once they had</p>
<p>been founded, they had all of them tried to strengthen their</p>
<p>internal administration and to exert the greatest possible influence</p>
<p>upon foreign affairs. All this of course had cost a great</p>
<p>deal of money. The mediaeval state with its lack of centralised</p>
<p>power did not depend upon a rich treasury. The king got his</p>
<p>revenues from the crown domains and his civil service paid for</p>
<p>itself. The modern centralised state was a more complicated</p>
<p>affair. The old knights disappeared and hired government</p>
<p>officials or bureaucrats took their place. Army, navy, and</p>
<p>internal administration demanded millions. The question then</p>
<p>became where was this money to be found?</p>
<p>Gold and silver had been a rare commodity in the middle</p>
<p>ages. The average man, as I have told you, never saw a gold</p>
<p>piece as long as he lived. Only the inhabitants of the large</p>
<p>cities were familiar with silver coin. The discovery of America</p>
<p>and the exploitation of the Peruvian mines changed all this.</p>
<p>The centre of trade was transferred from the Mediterranean to</p>
<p>the Atlantic seaboard. The old ``commercial cities&#x27;&#x27; of Italy lost</p>
<p>their financial importance. New ``commercial nations&#x27;&#x27; took</p>
<p>their place and gold and silver were no longer a curiosity.</p>
<p>Through Spain and Portugal and Holland and England,</p>
<p>precious metals began to find their way to Europe The sixteenth</p>
<p>century had its own writers on the subject of political</p>
<p>economy and they evolved a theory of national wealth which</p>
<p>seemed to them entirely sound and of the greatest possible</p>
<p>benefit to their respective countries. They reasoned that both</p>
<p>gold and silver were actual wealth. Therefore they believed</p>
<p>that the country with the largest supply of actual cash in the</p>
<p>vaults of its treasury and its banks was at the same time the</p>
<p>richest country. And since money meant armies, it followed</p>
<p>that the richest country was also the most powerful and could</p>
<p>rule the rest of the world.</p>
<p>We call this system the ``mercantile system,&#x27;&#x27; and it was</p>
<p>accepted with the same unquestioning faith with which the</p>
<p>early Christians believed in Miracles and many of the present-</p>
<p>day American business men believe in the Tariff. In practice,</p>
<p>the Mercantile system worked out as follows: To get the</p>
<p>largest surplus of precious metals a country must have a</p>
<p>favourable balance of export trade. If you can export more to</p>
<p>your neighbour than he exports to your own country, he will</p>
<p>owe you money and will be obliged to send you some of his</p>
<p>gold. Hence you gain and he loses. As a result of this creed,</p>
<p>the economic program of almost every seventeenth century</p>
<p>state was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Try to get possession of as many precious metals</li>
</ol>
<p>as you can.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Encourage foreign trade in preference to domestic</li>
</ol>
<p>trade.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Encourage those industries which change raw materials</li>
</ol>
<p>into exportable finished products.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Encourage a large population, for you will need workmen</li>
</ol>
<p>for your factories and an agricultural community</p>
<p>does not raise enough workmen.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Let the State watch this process and interfere whenever</li>
</ol>
<p>it is necessary to do so.</p>
<p>Instead of regarding International Trade as something</p>
<p>akin to a force of nature which would always obey certain natural</p>
<p>laws regardless of man&#x27;s interference, the people of the</p>
<p>sixteenth and seventeenth centuries tried to regulate their</p>
<p>commerce by the help of official decrees and royal laws and financial</p>
<p>help on the part of the government.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century Charles V adopted this Mercantile</p>
<p>System (which was then something entirely new) and introduced</p>
<p>it into his many possessions. Elizabeth of England</p>
<p>flattered him by her imitation. The Bourbons, especially King</p>
<p>Louis XIV, were fanatical adherents of this doctrine and Colbert,</p>
<p>his great minister of finance, became the prophet of Mercantilism</p>
<p>to whom all Europe looked for guidance.</p>
<p>The entire foreign policy of Cromwell was a practical</p>
<p>application of the Mercantile System. It was invariably directed</p>
<p>against the rich rival Republic of Holland. For the Dutch</p>
<p>shippers, as the common-carriers of the merchandise of Europe,</p>
<p>had certain leanings towards free-trade and therefore had</p>
<p>to be destroyed at all cost.</p>
<p>It will be easily understood how such a system must affect</p>
<p>the colonies. A colony under the Mercantile System became</p>
<p>merely a reservoir of gold and silver and spices, which was</p>
<p>to be tapped for the benefit of the home country. The Asiatic,</p>
<p>American and African supply of precious metals and the raw</p>
<p>materials of these tropical countries became a monopoly of</p>
<p>the state which happened to own that particular colony. No</p>
<p>outsider was ever allowed within the precincts and no native</p>
<p>was permitted to trade with a merchant whose ship flew a</p>
<p>foreign flag.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the Mercantile System encouraged the development</p>
<p>of young industries in certain countries where there</p>
<p>never had been any manufacturing before. It built roads</p>
<p>and dug canals and made for better means of transportation.</p>
<p>It demanded greater skill among the workmen and gave the</p>
<p>merchant a better social position, while it weakened the power</p>
<p>of the landed aristocracy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it caused very great misery. It made</p>
<p>the natives in the colonies the victims of a most shameless</p>
<p>exploitation. It exposed the citizens of the home country to an</p>
<p>even more terrible fate. It helped in a great measure to turn</p>
<p>every land into an armed camp and divided the world into little</p>
<p>bits of territory, each working for its own direct benefit,</p>
<p>while striving at all times to destroy the power of its neighbours</p>
<p>and get hold of their treasures. It laid so much stress</p>
<p>upon the importance of owning wealth that ``being rich&#x27;&#x27; came</p>
<p>to be regarded as the sole virtue of the average citizen. Economic</p>
<p>systems come and go like the fashions in surgery and</p>
<p>in the clothes of women, and during the nineteenth century the</p>
<p>Mercantile System was discarded in favor of a system of free</p>
<p>and open competition. At least, so I have been told.</p>
<p>THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION</p>
<p>AT THE END OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</p>
<p>EUROPE HEARD STRANGE REPORTS OF</p>
<p>SOMETHING WHICH HAD HAPPENED IN</p>
<p>THE WILDERNESS; OF THE NORTH AMERICAN</p>
<p>CONTINENT. THE DESCENDANTS</p>
<p>OF THE MEN WHO HAD PUNISHED KING</p>
<p>CHARLES FOR HIS INSISTENCE UPON HIS</p>
<p>``DIVINE RIGHTS&#x27;&#x27; ADDED A NEW CHAPTER</p>
<p>TO THE OLD STORY OF THE STRUGGLE</p>
<p>FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT</p>
<p>FOR the sake of convenience, we ought to go back a</p>
<p>few centuries and repeat the early history of the great</p>
<p>struggle for colonial possessions.</p>
<p>As soon as a number of European nations had been</p>
<p>created upon the new basis of national or dynastic interests,</p>
<p>that is to say, during and immediately after the Thirty</p>
<p>Years War, their rulers, backed up by the capital of</p>
<p>their merchants and the ships of their trading companies,</p>
<p>continued the fight for more territory in Asia, Africa and America.</p>
<p>The Spaniards and the Portuguese had been exploring the</p>
<p>Indian Sea and the Pacific Ocean for more than a century ere</p>
<p>Holland and England appeared upon the stage. This proved</p>
<p>an advantage to the latter. The first rough work had already</p>
<p>been done. What is more, the earliest navigators had so often</p>
<p>made themselves unpopular with the Asiatic and American and</p>
<p>African natives that both the English and the Dutch were</p>
<p>welcomed as friends and deliverers. We cannot claim any</p>
<p>superior virtues for either of these two races. But they were</p>
<p>merchants before everything else. They never allowed religious</p>
<p>considerations to interfere with their practical common sense.</p>
<p>During their first relations with weaker races, all European</p>
<p>nations have behaved with shocking brutality. The English and</p>
<p>the Dutch, however, knew better where to draw the dine. Provided</p>
<p>they got their spices and their gold and silver and their taxes,</p>
<p>they were willing to let the native live as it best pleased him.</p>
<p>It was not very difficult for them therefore to establish</p>
<p>themselves in the richest parts of the world. But as soon as</p>
<p>this had been accomplished, they began to fight each other for</p>
<p>still further possessions. Strangely enough, the colonial wars</p>
<p>were never settled in the colonies themselves. They were decided</p>
<p>three thousand miles away by the navies of the contending</p>
<p>countries. It is one of the most interesting principles of ancient</p>
<p>and modern warfare (one of the few reliable laws of</p>
<p>history) that ``the nation which commands the sea is also the</p>
<p>nation which commands the land.&#x27;&#x27; So far this law has never</p>
<p>failed to work, but the modern airplane may have changed it.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century, however, there were no flying machines</p>
<p>and it was the British navy which gained for England</p>
<p>her vast American and Indian and African colonies.</p>
<p>The series of naval wars between England and Holland in</p>
<p>the seventeenth century does not interest us here. It ended as</p>
<p>all such encounters between hopelessly ill-matched powers will</p>
<p>end. But the warfare between England and France (her other</p>
<p>rival) is of greater importance to us, for while the superior</p>
<p>British fleet in the end defeated the French navy, a great deal</p>
<p>of the preliminary fighting was done on our own American</p>
<p>continent. In this vast country, both France and England</p>
<p>claimed everything which had been discovered and a lot more</p>
<p>which the eye of no white man had ever seen. In 1497 Cabot</p>
<p>had landed in the northern part of America and twenty-seven</p>
<p>years later, Giovanni Verrazano had visited these coasts. Cabot</p>
<p>had flown the English flag. Verrazano had sailed under the</p>
<p>French flag. Hence both England and France proclaimed</p>
<p>themselves the owners of the entire continent.</p>
<p>During the seventeenth century, some ten small English</p>
<p>colonies had been founded between Maine and the Carolinas.</p>
<p>They were usually a haven of refuge for some particular sect</p>
<p>of English dissenters, such as the Puritans, who in the year</p>
<p>1620 went to New England, or the Quakers, who settled in</p>
<p>Pennsylvania in 1681. They were small frontier communities,</p>
<p>nestling close to the shores of the ocean, where people had</p>
<p>gathered to make a new home and begin life among happier</p>
<p>surroundings, far away from royal supervision and interference.</p>
<p>The French colonies, on the other hand, always remained</p>
<p>a possession of the crown. No Huguenots or Protestants were</p>
<p>allowed in these colonies for fear that they might contaminate</p>
<p>the Indians with their dangerous Protestant doctrines and</p>
<p>would perhaps interfere with the missionary work of the Jesuit</p>
<p>fathers. The English colonies, therefore, had been founded</p>
<p>upon a much healthier basis than their French neighbours and</p>
<p>rivals. They were an expression of the commercial energy of</p>
<p>the English middle classes, while the French settlements were</p>
<p>inhabited by people who had crossed the ocean as servants of the</p>
<p>king and who expected to return to Paris at the first possible chance.</p>
<p>Politically, however, the position of the English colonies</p>
<p>was far from satisfactory. The French had discovered the</p>
<p>mouth of the Saint Lawrence in the sixteenth century. From</p>
<p>the region of the Great Lakes they had worked their way southward,</p>
<p>had descended the Mississippi and had built several fortifications</p>
<p>along the Gulf of Mexico. After a century of exploration,</p>
<p>a line of sixty French forts cut off the English settlements</p>
<p>along the Atlantic seaboard from the interior.</p>
<p>The English land grants, made to the different colonial</p>
<p>companies had given them ``all land from sea to sea.&#x27;&#x27; This</p>
<p>sounded well on paper, but in practice, British territory</p>
<p>ended where the line of French fortifications began. To break</p>
<p>through this barrier was possible but it took both men and</p>
<p>money and caused a series of horrible border wars in which</p>
<p>both sides murdered their white neighbours, with the help of the</p>
<p>Indian tribes.</p>
<p>As long as the Stuarts had ruled England there had been</p>
<p>no danger of war with France. The Stuarts needed the Bourbons</p>
<p>in their attempt to establish an autocratic form of government</p>
<p>and to break the power of Parliament. But in 1689 the</p>
<p>last of the Stuarts had disappeared from British soil and Dutch</p>
<p>William, the great enemy of Louis XIV succeeded him. From</p>
<p>that time on, until the Treaty of Paris of 1763, France and</p>
<p>England fought for the possession of India and North America.</p>
<p>During these wars, as I have said before, the English navies</p>
<p>invariably beat the French. Cut off from her colonies, France</p>
<p>lost most of her possessions, and when peace was declared, the</p>
<p>entire North American continent had fallen into British hands</p>
<p>and the great work of exploration of Cartier, Champlain, La</p>
<p>Salle, Marquette and a score of others was lost to France.</p>
<p>Only a very small part of this vast domain was inhabited.</p>
<p>From Massachusetts in the north, where the Pilgrims (a sect</p>
<p>of Puritans who were very intolerant and who therefore had</p>
<p>found no happiness either in Anglican England or Calvinist</p>
<p>Holland) had landed in the year 1620, to the Carolinas and</p>
<p>Virginia (the tobacco-raising provinces which had been founded</p>
<p>entirely for the sake of profit), stretched a thin line of</p>
<p>sparsely populated territory. But the men who lived in this</p>
<p>new land of fresh air and high skies were very different from</p>
<p>their brethren of the mother country. In the wilderness they</p>
<p>had learned independence and self-reliance. They were the</p>
<p>sons of hardy and energetic ancestors. Lazy and timourous</p>
<p>people did not cross the ocean in those days. The American</p>
<p>colonists hated the restraint and the lack of breathing space</p>
<p>which had made their lives in the old country so very unhappy.</p>
<p>They meant to be their own masters. This the ruling classes</p>
<p>of England did not seem to understand. The government annoyed</p>
<p>the colonists and the colonists, who hated to be bothered</p>
<p>in this way, began to annoy the British government.</p>
<p>Bad feeling caused more bad feeling. It is not necessary</p>
<p>to repeat here in detail what actually happened and what might</p>
<p>have been avoided if the British king had been more intelligent</p>
<p>than George III or less given to drowsiness and indifference</p>
<p>than his minister, Lord North. The British colonists,</p>
<p>when they understood that peaceful arguments would not</p>
<p>settle the difficulties, took to arms. From being loyal subjects,</p>
<p>they turned rebels, who exposed themselves to the punishment</p>
<p>of death when they were captured by the German</p>
<p>soldiers, whom George hired to do his fighting after the pleasant</p>
<p>custom of that day, when Teutonic princes sold whole</p>
<p>regiments to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>The war between England and her American colonies</p>
<p>lasted seven years. During most of that time, the final success</p>
<p>of the rebels seemed very doubtful. A great number of</p>
<p>the people, especially in the cities, had remained loyal to their</p>
<p>king. They were in favour of a compromise, and would have</p>
<p>been willing to sue for peace. But the great figure of Washington</p>
<p>stood guard over the cause of the colonists.</p>
<p>Ably assisted by a handful of brave men, he used his steadfast</p>
<p>but badly equipped armies to weaken the forces of the king.</p>
<p>Time and again when defeat seemed unavoidable, his strategy</p>
<p>turned the tide of battle. Often his men were ill-fed. During</p>
<p>the winter they lacked shoes and coats and were forced to live</p>
<p>in unhealthy dug-outs. But their trust in their great leader</p>
<p>was absolute and they stuck it out until the final hour of victory.</p>
<p>But more interesting than the campaigns of Washington</p>
<p>or the diplomatic triumphs of Benjamin Franklin who was</p>
<p>in Europe getting money from the French government and</p>
<p>the Amsterdam bankers, was an event which occurred early in</p>
<p>the revolution. The representatives of the different colonies</p>
<p>had gathered in Philadelphia to discuss matters of common</p>
<p>importance. It was the first year of the Revolution. Most</p>
<p>of the big towns of the sea coast were still in the hands of the</p>
<p>British. Reinforcements from England were arriving by the</p>
<p>ship load. Only men who were deeply convinced of the righteousness</p>
<p>of their cause would have found the courage to take</p>
<p>the momentous decision of the months of June and July of</p>
<p>the year 1776.</p>
<p>In June, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia proposed a motion</p>
<p>to the Continental Congress that ``these united colonies</p>
<p>are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states, that</p>
<p>they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and</p>
<p>that all political connection between them and the state of</p>
<p>Great Britain is and ought to be, totally dissolved.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The motion was seconded by John Adams of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>It was carried on July the second and on July fourth,</p>
<p>it was followed by an official Declaration of Independence,</p>
<p>which was the work of Thomas Jefferson, a serious and exceedingly</p>
<p>capable student of both politics and government and</p>
<p>destined to be one of the most famous of out American presidents.</p>
<p>When news of this event reached Europe, and was followed</p>
<p>by the final victory of the colonists and the adoption of</p>
<p>the famous Constitution of the year 1787 (the first of all written</p>
<p>constitutions) it caused great interest. The dynastic system</p>
<p>of the highly centralised states which had been developed</p>
<p>after the great religious wars of the seventeenth century had</p>
<p>reached the height of its power. Everywhere the palace of</p>
<p>the king had grown to enormous proportions, while the cities</p>
<p>of the royal realm were being surrounded by rapidly growing</p>
<p>acres of slums. The inhabitants of those slums were showing</p>
<p>signs of restlessness. They were quite helpless. But the</p>
<p>higher classes, the nobles and the professional men, they too</p>
<p>were beginning to have certain doubts about the economic and</p>
<p>political conditions under which they lived. The success of</p>
<p>the American colonists showed them that many things were</p>
<p>possible which had been held impossible only a short time</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>According to the poet, the shot which opened the battle</p>
<p>of Lexington was ``heard around the world.&#x27;&#x27; That was a bit</p>
<p>of an exaggeration. The Chinese and the Japanese and the</p>
<p>Russians (not to speak of the Australians, who had just been</p>
<p>re-discovered by Captain Cook, whom they killed for his</p>
<p>trouble,) never heard of it at all. But it carried across the</p>
<p>Atlantic Ocean. It landed in the powder house of European</p>
<p>discontent and in France it caused an explosion which rocked</p>
<p>the entire continent from Petrograd to Madrid and buried the</p>
<p>representatives of the old statecraft and the old diplomacy</p>
<p>under several tons of democratic bricks.</p>
<p>THE FRENCH REVOLUTION</p>
<p>THE GREAT FRENCH REVOLUTION PROCLAIMS</p>
<p>THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY,</p>
<p>FRATERNITY AND EQUALITY UNTO ALL</p>
<p>THE PEOPLE OF THE EARTH</p>
<p>BEFORE we talk about a revolution it is just as well that</p>
<p>we explain just what this word means. In the terms of a</p>
<p>great Russian writer (and Russians ought to know what they</p>
<p>are talking about in this field) a revolution is ``a swift overthrow,</p>
<p>in a few years, of institutions which have taken centuries</p>
<p>to root in the soil, and seem so fixed and immovable that</p>
<p>even the most ardent reformers hardly dare to attack them in</p>
<p>their writings. It is the fall, the crumbling away in a brief</p>
<p>period, of all that up to that time has composed the essence</p>
<p>of social, religious, political and economic life in a nation.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Such a revolution took place in France in the eighteenth</p>
<p>century when the old civilisation of the country had grown</p>
<p>stale. The king in the days of Louis XIV had become</p>
<p>EVERYTHING and was the state. The Nobility, formerly</p>
<p>the civil servant of the federal state, found itself without any</p>
<p>duties and became a social ornament of the royal court.</p>
<p>This French state of the eighteenth century, however, cost</p>
<p>incredible sums of money. This money had to be produced</p>
<p>in the form of taxes. Unfortunately the kings of France had</p>
<p>not been strong enough to force the nobility and the clergy</p>
<p>to pay their share of these taxes. Hence the taxes were paid</p>
<p>entirely by the agricultural population. But the peasants</p>
<p>living in dreary hovels, no longer in intimate contact with their</p>
<p>former landlords, but victims of cruel and incompetent land</p>
<p>agents, were going from bad to worse. Why should they</p>
<p>work and exert themselves? Increased returns upon their</p>
<p>land merely meant more taxes and nothing for themselves</p>
<p>and therefore they neglected their fields as much as they dared.</p>
<p>Hence we have a king who wanders in empty splendour</p>
<p>through the vast halls of his palaces, habitually followed by</p>
<p>hungry office seekers, all of whom live upon the revenue obtained</p>
<p>from peasants who are no better than the beasts of the</p>
<p>fields. It is not a pleasant picture, but it is not exaggerated.</p>
<p>There was, however, another side to the so-called ``Ancien</p>
<p>Regime&#x27;&#x27; which we must keep in mind.</p>
<p>A wealthy middle class, closely connected with the nobility</p>
<p>(by the usual process of the rich banker&#x27;s daughter marrying</p>
<p>the poor baron&#x27;s son) and a court composed of all the most</p>
<p>entertaining people of France, had brought the polite art of</p>
<p>graceful living to its highest development. As the best brains</p>
<p>of the country were not allowed to occupy themselves with</p>
<p>questions of political economics, they spent their idle hours</p>
<p>upon the discussion of abstract ideas.</p>
<p>As fashions in modes of thought and personal behaviour</p>
<p>are quite as likely to run to extremes as fashion in dress, it</p>
<p>was natural that the most artificial society of that day should</p>
<p>take a tremendous interest in what they considered ``the simple</p>
<p>life.&#x27;&#x27; The king and the queen, the absolute and unquestioned</p>
<p>proprietors of this country galled France, together with all its</p>
<p>colonies and dependencies, went to live in funny little country</p>
<p>houses all dressed up as milk-maids and stable-boys and played</p>
<p>at being shepherds in a happy vale of ancient Hellas. Around</p>
<p>them, their courtiers danced attendance, their court-musicians</p>
<p>composed lovely minuets, their court barbers devised more</p>
<p>and more elaborate and costly headgear, until from sheer boredom</p>
<p>and lack of real jobs, this whole artificial world of Versailles</p>
<p>(the great show place which Louis XIV had built far</p>
<p>away from his noisy and restless city) talked of nothing but</p>
<p>those subjects which were furthest removed from their own</p>
<p>lives, just as a man who is starving will talk of nothing except</p>
<p>food.</p>
<p>When Voltaire, the courageous old philosopher, playwright,</p>
<p>historian and novelist, and the great enemy of all</p>
<p>religious and political tyranny, began to throw his bombs of</p>
<p>criticism at everything connected with the Established Order</p>
<p>of Things, the whole French world applauded him and his</p>
<p>theatrical pieces played to standing room only. When Jean</p>
<p>Jacques Rousseau waxed sentimental about primitive man</p>
<p>and gave his contemporaries delightful descriptions of the</p>
<p>happiness of the original inhabitants of this planet, (about</p>
<p>whom he knew as little as he did about the children, upon whose</p>
<p>education he was the recognised authority,) all France read</p>
<p>his ``Social Contract&#x27;&#x27; and this society in which the king and</p>
<p>the state were one, wept bitter tears when they heard Rousseau&#x27;s</p>
<p>appeal for a return to the blessed days when the real</p>
<p>sovereignty had lain in the hands of the people and when the</p>
<p>king had been merely the servant of his people.</p>
<p>When Montesquieu published his ``Persian Letters&#x27;&#x27; in</p>
<p>which two distinguished Persian travellers turn the whole existing</p>
<p>society of France topsy-turvy and poke fun at everything</p>
<p>from the king down to the lowest of his six hundred</p>
<p>pastry cooks, the book immediately went through four</p>
<p>editions and assured the writer thousands of readers for his</p>
<p>famous discussion of the ``Spirit of the Laws&#x27;&#x27; in which the</p>
<p>noble Baron compared the excellent English system with the</p>
<p>backward system of France and advocated instead of an absolute</p>
<p>monarchy the establishment of a state in which the Executive,</p>
<p>the Legislative and the Judicial powers should be in</p>
<p>separate hands and should work independently of each other.</p>
<p>When Lebreton, the Parisian book-seller, announced that</p>
<p>Messieurs Diderot, d&#x27;Alembert, Turgot and a score of other</p>
<p>distinguished writers were going to publish an Encyclopaedia</p>
<p>which was to contain ``all the new ideas and the new science</p>
<p>and the new knowledge,&#x27;&#x27; the response from the side of the</p>
<p>public was most satisfactory, and when after twenty-two years</p>
<p>the last of the twenty-eight volumes had been finished, the</p>
<p>somewhat belated interference of the police could not repress</p>
<p>the enthusiasm with which French society received this most</p>
<p>important but very dangerous contribution to the discussions</p>
<p>of the day.</p>
<p>Here, let me give you a little warning. When you read a</p>
<p>novel about the French revolution or see a play or a movie,</p>
<p>you will easily get the impression that the Revolution was the</p>
<p>work of the rabble from the Paris slums. It was nothing</p>
<p>of the kind. The mob appears often upon the ``evolutionary</p>
<p>stage, but invariably at the instigation and under the</p>
<p>leadership of those middle-class professional men who used the</p>
<p>hungry multitude as an efficient ally in their warfare upon</p>
<p>the king and his court. But the fundamental ideas which</p>
<p>caused the revolution were invented by a few brilliant minds,</p>
<p>and they were at first introduced into the charming drawing-rooms</p>
<p>of the ``Ancien Regime&#x27;&#x27; to provide amiable diversion</p>
<p>for the much-bored ladies and gentlemen of his Majesty&#x27;s court.</p>
<p>These pleasant but careless people played with the dangerous</p>
<p>fireworks of social criticism until the sparks fell through</p>
<p>the cracks of the floor, which was old and rotten just</p>
<p>like the rest of the building. Those sparks unfortunately</p>
<p>landed in the basement where age-old rubbish lay in great</p>
<p>confusion. Then there was a cry of fire. But the owner of</p>
<p>the house who was interested in everything except the management</p>
<p>of his property, did not know how to put the small blaze</p>
<p>out. The flame spread rapidly and the entire edifice was consumed</p>
<p>by the conflagration, which we call the Great French Revolution.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience, we can divide the French</p>
<p>Revolution into two parts. From 1789 to 1791 there was a</p>
<p>more or less orderly attempt to introduce a constitutional</p>
<p>monarchy. This failed, partly through lack of good faith and</p>
<p>stupidity on the part of the monarch himself, partly through</p>
<p>circumstances over which nobody had any control.</p>
<p>From 1792 to 1799 there was a Republic and a first effort</p>
<p>to establish a democratic form of government. But the actual</p>
<p>outbreak of violence had been preceded by many years of</p>
<p>unrest and many sincere but ineffectual attempts at reform.</p>
<p>When France had a debt of 4000 million francs and the</p>
<p>treasury was always empty and there was not a single thing</p>
<p>upon which new taxes could be levied, even good King Louis</p>
<p>(who was an expert locksmith and a great hunter but a very</p>
<p>poor statesman) felt vaguely that something ought to be done.</p>
<p>Therefore he called for Turgot, to be his Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l&#x27;Aulne, a man in the</p>
<p>early sixties, a splendid representative of the fast disappearing</p>
<p>class of landed gentry, had been a successful governor of a</p>
<p>province and was an amateur political economist of great ability.</p>
<p>He did his best. Unfortunately, he could not perform</p>
<p>miracles. As it was impossible to squeeze more taxes out of</p>
<p>the ragged peasants, it was necessary to get the necessary funds</p>
<p>from the nobility and clergy who had never paid a centime.</p>
<p>This made Turgot the best hated man at the court of Versailles.</p>
<p>Furthermore he was obliged to face the enmity of Marie</p>
<p>Antoinette, the queen, who was against everybody who dared</p>
<p>to mention the word ``economy&#x27;&#x27; within her hearing. Soon</p>
<p>Turgot was called an <code>unpractical visionary&#x27;&#x27; and a </code>theoretical-</p>
<p>professor&#x27;&#x27; and then of course his position became untenable.</p>
<p>In the year 1776 he was forced to resign.</p>
<p>After the ``professor&#x27;&#x27; there came a man of Practical Business</p>
<p>Sense. He was an industrious Swiss by the name of</p>
<p>Necker who had made himself rich as a grain speculator and</p>
<p>the partner in an international banking house. His ambitious</p>
<p>wife had pushed him into the government service that she</p>
<p>might establish a position for her daughter who afterwards as</p>
<p>the wife of the Swedish minister in Paris, Baron de Stael,</p>
<p>became a famous literary figure of the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Necker set to work with a fine display of zeal just as Turgot</p>
<p>had done. In 1781 he published a careful review of the French</p>
<p>finances. The king understood nothing of this ``Compte</p>
<p>Rendu.&#x27;&#x27; He had just sent troops to America to help the colonists</p>
<p>against their common enemies, the English. This expedition</p>
<p>proved to be unexpectedly expensive and Necker was</p>
<p>asked to find the necessary funds. When instead of producing</p>
<p>revenue, he published more figures and made statistics</p>
<p>and began to use the dreary warning about ``necessary economies&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>his days were numbered. In the year 1781 he was</p>
<p>dismissed as an incompetent servant.</p>
<p>After the Professor and the Practical Business Man came</p>
<p>the delightful type of financier who will guarantee everybody</p>
<p>100 per cent. per month on their money if only they will</p>
<p>trust his own infallible system.</p>
<p>He was Charles Alexandre de Calonne, a pushing official,</p>
<p>who had made his career both by his industry and his</p>
<p>complete lack of honesty and scruples. He found the country</p>
<p>heavily indebted, but he was a clever man, willing to oblige</p>
<p>everybody, and he invented a quick remedy. He paid the</p>
<p>old debts by contracting new ones. This method is not new.</p>
<p>The result since time immemorial has been disastrous. In</p>
<p>less than three years more than 800,000,000 francs had been</p>
<p>added to the French debt by this charming Minister of Finance</p>
<p>who never worried and smilingly signed his name to every</p>
<p>demand that was made by His Majesty and by his lovely</p>
<p>Queen, who had learned the habit of spending during the days</p>
<p>of her youth in Vienna.</p>
<p>At last even the Parliament of Paris (a high court of justice</p>
<p>and not a legislative body) although by no means lacking</p>
<p>in loyalty to their sovereign, decided that something must be</p>
<p>done. Calonne wanted to borrow another 80,000,000 francs.</p>
<p>It had been a bad year for the crops and the misery and hunger</p>
<p>in the country districts were terrible. Unless something sensible</p>
<p>were done, France would go bankrupt. The King as always</p>
<p>was unaware of the seriousness of the situation. Would it not</p>
<p>be a good idea to consult the representatives of the people?</p>
<p>Since 1614 no Estates General had been called together. In</p>
<p>view of the threatening panic there was a demand that the</p>
<p>Estates be convened. Louis XVI however, who never could</p>
<p>take a decision, refused to go as far as that.</p>
<p>To pacify the popular clamour he called together a meeting</p>
<p>of the Notables in the year 1787. This merely meant a gathering</p>
<p>of the best families who discussed what could and should</p>
<p>be done, without touching their feudal and clerical privilege</p>
<p>of tax-exemption. It is unreasonable to expect that a certain</p>
<p>class of society shall commit political and economic suicide for</p>
<p>the benefit of another group of fellow-citizens. The 127</p>
<p>Notables obstinately refused to surrender a single one of their</p>
<p>ancient rights. The crowd in the street, being now exceedingly</p>
<p>hungry, demanded that Necker, in whom they had confidence,</p>
<p>be reappointed. The Notables said ``No.&#x27;&#x27; The crowd</p>
<p>in the street began to smash windows and do other unseemly</p>
<p>things. The Notables fled. Calonne was dismissed.</p>
<p>A new colourless Minister of Finance, the Cardinal</p>
<p>Lomenie de Brienne, was appointed and Louis, driven by the</p>
<p>violent threats of his starving subjects, agreed to call together</p>
<p>the old Estates General as ``soon as practicable.&#x27;&#x27; This vague</p>
<p>promise of course satisfied no one.</p>
<p>No such severe winter had been experienced for almost a</p>
<p>century. The crops had been either destroyed by floods or had</p>
<p>been frozen to death in the fields. All the olive trees of the</p>
<p>Provence had been killed. Private charity tried to do some-</p>
<p>thing but could accomplish little for eighteen million starving</p>
<p>people. Everywhere bread riots occurred. A generation before</p>
<p>these would have been put down by the army. But the</p>
<p>work of the new philosophical school had begun to bear fruit.</p>
<p>People began to understand that a shotgun is no effective</p>
<p>remedy for a hungry stomach and even the soldiers (who came</p>
<p>from among the people) were no longer to be depended upon.</p>
<p>It was absolutely necessary that the king should do something</p>
<p>definite to regain the popular goodwill, but again he hesitated.</p>
<p>Here and there in the provinces, little independent Republics</p>
<p>were established by followers of the new school. The cry</p>
<p>of ``no taxation without representation&#x27;&#x27; (the slogan of the</p>
<p>American rebels a quarter of a century before) was heard</p>
<p>among the faithful middle classes. France was threatened with</p>
<p>general anarchy. To appease the people and to increase the</p>
<p>royal popularity, the government unexpectedly suspended the</p>
<p>former very strict form of censorship of books. At once a</p>
<p>flood of ink descended upon France. Everybody, high or</p>
<p>low, criticised and was criticised. More than 2000</p>
<p>pamphlets were published. Lomenie de Brienne was swept away</p>
<p>by a storm of abuse. Necker was hastily called back to placate,</p>
<p>as best he could, the nation-wide unrest. Immediately the stock</p>
<p>market went up thirty per cent. And by common consent, people</p>
<p>suspended judgment for a little while longer. In May of</p>
<p>1789 the Estates General were to assemble and then the wisdom</p>
<p>of the entire nation would speedily solve the difficult problem</p>
<p>of recreating the kingdom of France into a healthy and happy</p>
<p>state.</p>
<p>This prevailing idea, that the combined wisdom of the</p>
<p>people would be able to solve all difficulties, proved disastrous.</p>
<p>It lamed all personal effort during many important months.</p>
<p>Instead of keeping the government in his own hands at this</p>
<p>critical moment, Necker allowed everything to drift. Hence</p>
<p>there was a new outbreak of the acrimonious debate upon the</p>
<p>best ways to reform the old kingdom. Everywhere the power</p>
<p>of the police weakened. The people of the Paris suburbs,</p>
<p>under the leadership of professional agitators, gradually began</p>
<p>to discover their strength, and commenced to play the role</p>
<p>which was to be theirs all through the years of the great unrest,</p>
<p>when they acted as the brute force which was used by the actual</p>
<p>leaders of the Revolution to secure those things which could</p>
<p>not be obtained in a legitimate fashion.</p>
<p>As a sop to the peasants and the middle class, Necker de-</p>
<p>cided that they should be allowed a double representation in</p>
<p>the Estates General. Upon this subject, the Abbe Sieyes then</p>
<p>wrote a famous pamphlet, ``To what does the Third Estate</p>
<p>Amount?&#x27;&#x27; in which he came to the conclusion that the Third</p>
<p>Estate (a name given to the middle class) ought to amount to</p>
<p>everything, that it had not amounted to anything in the past,</p>
<p>and that it now desired to amount to something. He expressed</p>
<p>the sentiment of the great majority of the people who had the</p>
<p>best interests of the country at heart.</p>
<p>Finally the elections took place under the worst conditions</p>
<p>imaginable. When they were over, 308 clergymen, 285 noblemen</p>
<p>and 621 representatives of the Third Estate packed their</p>
<p>trunks to go to Versailles. The Third Estate was obliged to</p>
<p>carry additional luggage. This consisted of voluminous reports</p>
<p>called ``cahiers&#x27;&#x27; in which the many complaints and grievances</p>
<p>of their constituents had been written down. The stage</p>
<p>was set for the great final act that was to save France.</p>
<p>The Estates General came together on May 5th, 1789.</p>
<p>The king was in a bad humour. The Clergy and the Nobility</p>
<p>let it be known that they were unwilling to give up a single one</p>
<p>of their privileges. The king ordered the three groups of</p>
<p>representatives to meet in different rooms and discuss their</p>
<p>grievances separately. The Third Estate refused to obey the royal</p>
<p>command. They took a solemn oath to that effect in a squash</p>
<p>court (hastily put in order for the purpose of this illegal meeting)</p>
<p>on the 20th of June, 1789. They insisted that all three</p>
<p>Estates, Nobility, Clergy and Third Estate, should meet together</p>
<p>and so informed His Majesty. The king gave in.</p>
<p>As the ``National Assembly,&#x27;&#x27; the Estates General began</p>
<p>to discuss the state of the French kingdom. The King got</p>
<p>angry. Then again he hesitated. He said that he would never</p>
<p>surrender his absolute power. Then he went hunting, forgot</p>
<p>all about the cares of the state and when he returned from the</p>
<p>chase he gave in. For it was the royal habit to do the right</p>
<p>thing at the wrong time in the wrong way. When the people</p>
<p>clamoured for A, the king scolded them and gave them nothing.</p>
<p>Then, when the Palace was surrounded by a howling multitude</p>
<p>of poor people, the king surrendered and gave his subjects</p>
<p>what they had asked for. By this time, however, the people</p>
<p>wanted A plus B. The comedy was repeated. When the king</p>
<p>signed his name to the Royal Decree which granted his beloved</p>
<p>subjects A and B they were threatening to kill the entire royal</p>
<p>family unless they received A plus B plus C. And so on,</p>
<p>through the whole alphabet and up to the scaffold.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the king was always just one letter behind.</p>
<p>He never understood this. Even when he laid his head under</p>
<p>the guillotine, he felt that he was a much-abused man who had</p>
<p>received a most unwarrantable treatment at the hands of people</p>
<p>whom he had loved to the best of his limited ability.</p>
<p>Historical ``ifs,&#x27;&#x27; as I have often warned you, are never of</p>
<p>any value. It is very easy for us to say that the monarchy</p>
<p>might have been saved ``if&#x27;&#x27; Louis had been a man of greater</p>
<p>energy and less kindness of heart. But the king was not alone.</p>
<p>Even ``if&#x27;&#x27; he had possessed the ruthless strength of Napoleon,</p>
<p>his career during these difficult days might have been easily</p>
<p>ruined by his wife who was the daughter of Maria Theresa of</p>
<p>Austria and who possessed all the characteristic virtues and</p>
<p>vices of a young girl who had been brought up at the most</p>
<p>autocratic and mediaeval court of that age.</p>
<p>She decided that some action must be taken and planned a</p>
<p>counter-revolution. Necker was suddenly dismissed and loyal</p>
<p>troops were called to Paris. The people, when they heard of</p>
<p>this, stormed the fortress of the Bastille prison, and on the</p>
<p>fourteenth of July of the year 1789, they destroyed this</p>
<p>familiar but much-hated symbol of Autocratic Power</p>
<p>which had long since ceased to be a political prison and</p>
<p>was now used as the city lock-up for pickpockets and second-</p>
<p>story men. Many of the nobles took the hint and left the</p>
<p>country. But the king as usual did nothing. He had been</p>
<p>hunting on the day of the fall of the Bastille and he had shot</p>
<p>several deer and felt very much pleased.</p>
<p>The National Assembly now set to work and on the 4th of</p>
<p>August, with the noise of the Parisian multitude in their ears,</p>
<p>they abolished all privileges. This was followed on the 27th</p>
<p>of August by the ``Declaration of the Rights of Man,&#x27;&#x27; the</p>
<p>famous preamble to the first French constitution. So far so</p>
<p>good, but the court had apparently not yet learned its lesson.</p>
<p>There was a wide-spread suspicion that the king was again</p>
<p>trying to interfere with these reforms and as a result, on the</p>
<p>5th of October, there was a second riot in Paris. It spread to</p>
<p>Versailles and the people were not pacified until they had</p>
<p>brought the king back to his palace in Paris. They did not</p>
<p>trust him in Versailles. They liked to have him where they</p>
<p>could watch him and control his correspondence with his relatives</p>
<p>in Vienna and Madrid and the other courts of Europe.</p>
<p>In the Assembly meanwhile, Mirabeau, a nobleman who</p>
<p>had become leader of the Third Estate, was beginning to put</p>
<p>order into chaos. But before he could save the position of the</p>
<p>king he died, on the 2nd of April of the year 1791. The king,</p>
<p>who now began to fear for his own life, tried to escape on the</p>
<p>21st of June. He was recognised from his picture on a coin,</p>
<p>was stopped near the village of Varennes by members of the</p>
<p>National Guard, and was brought back to Paris,</p>
<p>In September of 1791, the first constitution of France was</p>
<p>accepted, and the members of the National Assembly went</p>
<p>home. On the first of October of 1791, the legislative assembly</p>
<p>came together to continue the work of the National</p>
<p>Assembly. In this new gathering of popular representatives</p>
<p>there were many extremely revolutionary elements. The</p>
<p>boldest among these were known as the Jacobins, after the old</p>
<p>Jacobin cloister in which they held their political meetings.</p>
<p>These young men (most of them belonging to the professional</p>
<p>classes) made very violent speeches and when the newspapers</p>
<p>carried these orations to Berlin and Vienna, the King of</p>
<p>Prussia and the Emperor decided that they must do something</p>
<p>to save their good brother and sister. They were very busy</p>
<p>just then dividing the kingdom of Poland, where rival political</p>
<p>factions had caused such a state of disorder that the country</p>
<p>was at the mercy of anybody who wanted to take a couple of</p>
<p>provinces. But they managed to send an army to invade</p>
<p>France and deliver the king.</p>
<p>Then a terrible panic of fear swept throughout the land</p>
<p>of France. All the pent-up hatred of years of hunger and</p>
<p>suffering came to a horrible climax. The mob of Paris stormed</p>
<p>the palace of the Tuilleries. The faithful Swiss bodyguards</p>
<p>tried to defend their master, but Louis, unable to make up his</p>
<p>mind, gave order to ``cease firing&#x27;&#x27; just when the crowd was</p>
<p>retiring. The people, drunk with blood and noise and cheap</p>
<p>wine, murdered the Swiss to the last man, then invaded the</p>
<p>palace, and went after Louis who had escaped into the meeting</p>
<p>hall of the Assembly, where he was immediately suspended of</p>
<p>his office, and from where he was taken as a prisoner to the</p>
<p>old castle of the Temple.</p>
<p>But the armies of Austria and Prussia continued their advance</p>
<p>and the panic changed into hysteria and turned men and</p>
<p>women into wild beasts. In the first week of September of</p>
<p>the year 1792, the crowd broke into the jails and murdered all</p>
<p>the prisoners. The government did not interfere. The Jacobins,</p>
<p>headed by Danton, knew that this crisis meant either the</p>
<p>success or the failure of the revolution, and that only the most</p>
<p>brutal audacity could save them. The Legislative Assembly</p>
<p>was closed and on the 21st of September of the year 1792, a</p>
<p>new National Convention came together. It was a body composed</p>
<p>almost entirely of extreme revolutionists. The king was</p>
<p>formally accused of high treason and was brought before the</p>
<p>Convention. He was found guilty and by a vote of 361 to 360</p>
<p>(the extra vote being that of his cousin the Duke of Orleans)</p>
<p>he was condemned to death. On the 21st of January of the</p>
<p>year 1793, he quietly and with much dignity suffered himself</p>
<p>to be taken to the scaffold. He had never understood what all</p>
<p>the shooting and the fuss had been about. And he had been too</p>
<p>proud to ask questions.</p>
<p>Then the Jacobins turned against the more moderate element</p>
<p>in the convention, the Girondists, called after their southern</p>
<p>district, the Gironde. A special revolutionary tribunal was</p>
<p>instituted and twenty-one of the leading Girondists were</p>
<p>condemned to death. The others committed suicide. They were</p>
<p>capable and honest men but too philosophical and too moderate</p>
<p>to survive during these frightful years.</p>
<p>In October of the year 1793 the Constitution was</p>
<p>suspended by the Jacobins ``until peace should have been</p>
<p>declared.&#x27;&#x27; All power was placed in the hands of a small committee</p>
<p>of Public Safety, with Danton and Robespierre as its</p>
<p>leaders. The Christian religion and the old chronology were</p>
<p>abolished. The ``Age of Reason&#x27;&#x27; (of which Thomas Paine had</p>
<p>written so eloquently during the American Revolution) had</p>
<p>come and with it the ``Terror&#x27;&#x27; which for more than a year killed</p>
<p>good and bad and indifferent people at the rate of seventy or</p>
<p>eighty a day.</p>
<p>The autocratic rule of the King had been destroyed. It</p>
<p>was succeeded by the tyranny of a few people who had such a</p>
<p>passionate love for democratic virtue that they felt compelled</p>
<p>to kill all those who disagreed with them. France was turned</p>
<p>into a slaughter house. Everybody suspected everybody else.</p>
<p>No one felt safe. Out of sheer fear, a few members of the old</p>
<p>Convention, who knew that they were the next candidates for</p>
<p>the scaffold, finally turned against Robespierre, who had</p>
<p>already decapitated most of his former colleagues. Robespierre,</p>
<p>``the only true and pure Democrat,&#x27;&#x27; tried to kill himself</p>
<p>but failed His shattered jaw was hastily bandaged and</p>
<p>he was dragged to the guillotine. On the 27th of July, of the</p>
<p>year 1794 (the 9th Thermidor of the year II, according to the</p>
<p>strange chronology of the revolution), the reign of Terror came</p>
<p>to an end, and all Paris danced with joy.</p>
<p>The dangerous position of France, however, made it necessary</p>
<p>that the government remain in the hands of a few strong</p>
<p>men, until the many enemies of the revolution should have been</p>
<p>driven from the soil of the French fatherland. While the</p>
<p>half-clad and half-starved revolutionary armies fought their</p>
<p>desperate battles of the Rhine and Italy and Belgium and</p>
<p>Egypt, and defeated every one of the enemies of the Great</p>
<p>Revolution, five Directors were appointed, and they ruled</p>
<p>France for four years. Then the power was vested in the hands</p>
<p>of a successful general by the name of Napoleon Bonaparte,</p>
<p>who became ``First Consul&#x27;&#x27; of France in the year 1799. And</p>
<p>during the next fifteen years, the old European continent became</p>
<p>the laboratory of a number of political experiments, the</p>
<p>like of which the world had never seen before.</p>
<p>NAPOLEON</p>
<p>NAPOLEON</p>
<p>NAPOLEON was born in the year 1769, the third son</p>
<p>of Carlo Maria Buonaparte, an honest notary public of</p>
<p>the city of Ajaccio in the island of Corsica, and his good</p>
<p>wife, Letizia Ramolino. He therefore was not a Frenchman,</p>
<p>but an Italian whose native island (an old Greek, Carthaginian</p>
<p>and Roman colony in the Mediterranean Sea) had</p>
<p>for years been struggling to regain its independence,</p>
<p>first of all from the Genoese, and after the middle of the</p>
<p>eighteenth century from the French, who had kindly offered</p>
<p>to help the Corsicans in their struggle for freedom and had</p>
<p>then occupied the island for their own benefit.</p>
<p>During the first twenty years of his life, young Napoleon</p>
<p>was a professional Corsican patriot--a Corsican Sinn Feiner,</p>
<p>who hoped to deliver his beloved country from the yoke of the</p>
<p>bitterly hated French enemy. But the French revolution had</p>
<p>unexpectedly recognised the claims of the Corsicans and gradually</p>
<p>Napoleon, who had received a good training at the military</p>
<p>school of Brienne, drifted into the service of his adopted country.</p>
<p>Although he never learned to spell French correctly or</p>
<p>to speak it without a broad Italian accent, he became a Frenchman.</p>
<p>In due time he came to stand as the highest expression</p>
<p>of all French virtues. At present he is regarded as the symbol</p>
<p>of the Gallic genius.</p>
<p>Napoleon was what is called a fast worker. His career</p>
<p>does not cover more than twenty years. In that short span</p>
<p>of time he fought more wars and gained more victories and</p>
<p>marched more miles and conquered more square kilometers and</p>
<p>killed more people and brought about more reforms and generally</p>
<p>upset Europe to a greater extent than anybody (including</p>
<p>Alexander the Great and Jenghis Khan) had ever managed</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>He was a little fellow and during the first years of his life</p>
<p>his health was not very good. He never impressed anybody</p>
<p>by his good looks and he remained to the end of his days very</p>
<p>clumsy whenever he was obliged to appear at a social function.</p>
<p>He did not enjoy a single advantage of breeding or birth or</p>
<p>riches. For the greater part of his youth he was desperately</p>
<p>poor and often he had to go without a meal or was obliged</p>
<p>to make a few extra pennies in curious ways.</p>
<p>He gave little promise as a literary genius. When he competed</p>
<p>for a prize offered by the Academy of Lyons, his essay</p>
<p>was found to be next to the last and he was number 15 out of</p>
<p>16 candidates. But he overcame all these difficulties through</p>
<p>his absolute and unshakable belief in his own destiny, and in</p>
<p>his own glorious future. Ambition was the main-spring of his</p>
<p>life. The thought of self, the worship of that capital letter</p>
<p>``N&#x27;&#x27; with which he signed all his letters, and which recurred</p>
<p>forever in the ornaments of his hastily constructed palaces, the</p>
<p>absolute will to make the name Napoleon the most important</p>
<p>thing in the world next to the name of God, these desires carried</p>
<p>Napoleon to a pinnacle of fame which no other man has</p>
<p>ever reached.</p>
<p>When he was a half-pay lieutenant, young Bonaparte was</p>
<p>very fond of the ``Lives of Famous Men&#x27;&#x27; which Plutarch, the</p>
<p>Roman historian, had written. But he never tried to live up</p>
<p>to the high standard of character set by these heroes of the</p>
<p>older days. Napoleon seems to have been devoid of all those</p>
<p>considerate and thoughtful sentiments which make men</p>
<p>different from the animals. It will be very difficult to decide</p>
<p>with any degree of accuracy whether he ever loved anyone</p>
<p>besides himself. He kept a civil tongue to his mother, but</p>
<p>Letizia had the air and manners of a great lady and after the</p>
<p>fashion of Italian mothers, she knew how to rule her brood of</p>
<p>children and command their respect. For a few years he was</p>
<p>fond of Josephine, his pretty Creole wife, who was the daughter</p>
<p>of a French officer of Martinique and the widow of the</p>
<p>Vicomte de Beauharnais, who had been executed by Robespierre</p>
<p>when he lost a battle against the Prussians. But</p>
<p>the Emperor divorced her when she failed to give him a son</p>
<p>and heir and married the daughter of the Austrian Emperor,</p>
<p>because it seemed good policy.</p>
<p>During the siege of Toulon, where he gained great fame</p>
<p>as commander of a battery, Napoleon studied Macchiavelli</p>
<p>with industrious care. He followed the advice of the Florentine</p>
<p>statesman and never kept his word when it was to his</p>
<p>advantage to break it. The word ``gratitude&#x27;&#x27; did not occur in</p>
<p>his personal dictionary. Neither, to be quite fair, did he expect</p>
<p>it from others. He was totally indifferent to human suffering.</p>
<p>He executed prisoners of war (in Egypt in 1798) who had</p>
<p>been promised their lives, and he quietly allowed his wounded</p>
<p>in Syria to be chloroformed when he found it impossible to</p>
<p>transport them to his ships. He ordered the Duke of Enghien</p>
<p>to be condemned to death by a prejudiced court-martial and to</p>
<p>be shot contrary to all law on the sole ground that the</p>
<p>``Bourbons needed a warning.&#x27;&#x27; He decreed that those German</p>
<p>officers who were made prisoner while fighting for their</p>
<p>country&#x27;s independence should be shot against the nearest wall,</p>
<p>and when Andreas Hofer, the Tyrolese hero, fell into his hands</p>
<p>after a most heroic resistance, he was executed like a common</p>
<p>traitor.</p>
<p>In short, when we study the character of the Emperor, we</p>
<p>begin to understand those anxious British mothers who used</p>
<p>to drive their children to bed with the threat that ``Bonaparte,</p>
<p>who ate little boys and girls for breakfast, would come and get</p>
<p>them if they were not very good.&#x27;&#x27; And yet, having said these</p>
<p>many unpleasant things about this strange tyrant, who looked</p>
<p>after every other department of his army with the utmost care,</p>
<p>but neglected the medical service, and who ruined his uniforms</p>
<p>with Eau de Cologne because he could not stand the smell of</p>
<p>his poor sweating soldiers; having said all these unpleasant</p>
<p>things and being fully prepared to add many more, I must</p>
<p>confess to a certain lurking feeling of doubt.</p>
<p>Here I am sitting at a comfortable table loaded heavily</p>
<p>with books, with one eye on my typewriter and the other on</p>
<p>Licorice the cat, who has a great fondness for carbon paper,</p>
<p>and I am telling you that the Emperor Napoleon was a most</p>
<p>contemptible person. But should I happen to look out of</p>
<p>the window, down upon Seventh Avenue, and should the endless</p>
<p>procession of trucks and carts come to a sudden halt, and</p>
<p>should I hear the sound of the heavy drums and see the little</p>
<p>man on his white horse in his old and much-worn green uniform,</p>
<p>then I don&#x27;t know, but I am afraid that I would leave</p>
<p>my books and the kitten and my home and everything else to</p>
<p>follow him wherever he cared to lead. My own grandfather</p>
<p>did this and Heaven knows he was not born to be a hero.</p>
<p>Millions of other people&#x27;s grandfathers did it. They received</p>
<p>no reward, but they expected none. They cheerfully</p>
<p>gave legs and arms and lives to serve this foreigner, who took</p>
<p>them a thousand miles away from their homes and marched</p>
<p>them into a barrage of Russian or English or Spanish or</p>
<p>Italian or Austrian cannon and stared quietly into space while</p>
<p>they were rolling in the agony of death.</p>
<p>If you ask me for an explanation, I must answer that I</p>
<p>have none. I can only guess at one of the reasons. Napoleon</p>
<p>was the greatest of actors and the whole European continent</p>
<p>was his stage. At all times and under all circumstances</p>
<p>he knew the precise attitude that would impress the spectators</p>
<p>most and he understood what words would make the deepest</p>
<p>impression. Whether he spoke in the Egyptian desert, before</p>
<p>the backdrop of the Sphinx and the pyramids, or addressed</p>
<p>his shivering men on the dew-soaked plains of Italy, made no</p>
<p>difference. At all times he was master of the situation. Even</p>
<p>at the end, an exile on a little rock in the middle of the Atlantic,</p>
<p>a sick man at the mercy of a dull and intolerable British governor,</p>
<p>he held the centre of the stage.</p>
<p>After the defeat of Waterloo, no one outside of a few</p>
<p>trusted friends ever saw the great Emperor. The people of</p>
<p>Europe knew that he was living on the island of St. Helena--</p>
<p>they knew that a British garrison guarded him day and night</p>
<p>--they knew that the British fleet guarded the garrison which</p>
<p>guarded the Emperor on his farm at Longwood. But he was</p>
<p>never out of the mind of either friend or enemy. When illness</p>
<p>and despair had at last taken him away, his silent eyes continued</p>
<p>to haunt the world. Even to-day he is as much of a force</p>
<p>in the life of France as a hundred years ago when people</p>
<p>fainted at the mere sight of this sallow-faced man who stabled</p>
<p>his horses in the holiest temples of the Russian Kremlin, and</p>
<p>who treated the Pope and the mighty ones of this earth as if</p>
<p>they were his lackeys.</p>
<p>To give you a mere outline of his life would demand</p>
<p>couple of volumes. To tell you of his great political reform</p>
<p>of the French state, of his new codes of laws which were</p>
<p>adopted in most European countries, of his activities in every</p>
<p>field of public activity, would take thousands of pages. But</p>
<p>I can explain in a few words why he was so successful during</p>
<p>the first part of his career and why he failed during the last</p>
<p>ten years. From the year 1789 until the year 1804, Napoleon</p>
<p>was the great leader of the French revolution. He was not</p>
<p>merely fighting for the glory of his own name. He defeated</p>
<p>Austria and Italy and England and Russia because he, himself,</p>
<p>and his soldiers were the apostles of the new creed of</p>
<p>``Liberty, Fraternity and Equality&#x27;&#x27; and were the enemies of</p>
<p>the courts while they were the friends of the people.</p>
<p>But in the year 1804, Napoleon made himself Hereditary</p>
<p>Emperor of the French and sent for Pope Pius VII to come</p>
<p>and crown him, even as Leo III, in the year 800 had crowned</p>
<p>that other great King of the Franks, Charlemagne, whose example</p>
<p>was constantly before Napoleon&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>Once upon the throne, the old revolutionary chieftain became</p>
<p>an unsuccessful imitation of a Habsburg monarch. He</p>
<p>forgot his spiritual Mother, the Political Club of the Jacobins.</p>
<p>He ceased to be the defender of the oppressed. He became the</p>
<p>chief of all the oppressors and kept his shooting squads ready</p>
<p>to execute those who dared to oppose his imperial will. No</p>
<p>one had shed a tear when in the year 1806 the sad remains of</p>
<p>the Holy Roman Empire were carted to the historical dustbin</p>
<p>and when the last relic of ancient Roman glory was destroyed</p>
<p>by the grandson of an Italian peasant. But when the Napoleonic</p>
<p>armies had invaded Spain, had forced the Spaniards to</p>
<p>recognise a king whom they detested, had massacred the poor</p>
<p>Madrilenes who remained faithful to their old rulers, then</p>
<p>public opinion turned against the former hero of Marengo and</p>
<p>Austerlitz and a hundred other revolutionary battles. Then</p>
<p>and only then, when Napoleon was no longer the hero of the</p>
<p>revolution but the personification of all the bad traits of the</p>
<p>Old Regime, was it possible for England to give direction to</p>
<p>the fast-spreading sentiment of hatred which was turning all</p>
<p>honest men into enemies of the French Emperor.</p>
<p>The English people from the very beginning had felt</p>
<p>deeply disgusted when their newspapers told them the gruesome</p>
<p>details of the Terror. They had staged their own great</p>
<p>revolution (during the reign of Charles I) a century before.</p>
<p>It had been a very simple affair compared to the upheaval of</p>
<p>Paris. In the eyes of the average Englishman a Jacobin was</p>
<p>a monster to be shot at sight and Napoleon was the Chief Devil.</p>
<p>The British fleet had blockaded France ever since the year</p>
<ol start="1798">
<li>It had spoiled Napoleon&#x27;s plan to invade India by way</li>
</ol>
<p>of Egypt and had forced him to beat an ignominious retreat,</p>
<p>after his victories along the banks of the Nile. And finally,</p>
<p>in the year 1805, England got the chance it had waited for so</p>
<p>long.</p>
<p>Near Cape Trafalgar on the southwestern coast of Spain,</p>
<p>Nelson annihilated the Napoleonic fleet, beyond a possible</p>
<p>chance of recovery. From that moment on, the Emperor was</p>
<p>landlocked. Even so, he would have been able to maintain</p>
<p>himself as the recognised ruler of the continent had he understood</p>
<p>the signs of the times and accepted the honourable peace</p>
<p>which the powers offered him. But Napoleon had been blinded</p>
<p>by the blaze of his own glory. He would recognise no equals.</p>
<p>He could tolerate no rivals. And his hatred turned against</p>
<p>Russia, the mysterious land of the endless plains with its</p>
<p>inexhaustible supply of cannon-fodder.</p>
<p>As long as Russia was ruled by Paul I, the half-witted son</p>
<p>of Catherine the Great, Napoleon had known how to deal with</p>
<p>the situation. But Paul grew more and more irresponsible</p>
<p>until his exasperated subjects were obliged to murder him</p>
<p>(lest they all be sent to the Siberian lead-mines) and the son of</p>
<p>Paul, the Emperor Alexander, did not share his father&#x27;s affection</p>
<p>for the usurper whom he regarded as the enemy of mankind,</p>
<p>the eternal disturber of the peace. He was a pious man</p>
<p>who believed that he had been chosen by God to deliver the</p>
<p>world from the Corsican curse. He joined Prussia and England</p>
<p>and Austria and he was defeated. He tried five times</p>
<p>and five times he failed. In the year 1812 he once more taunted</p>
<p>Napoleon until the French Emperor, in a blind rage, vowed</p>
<p>that he would dictate peace in Moscow. Then, from far and</p>
<p>wide, from Spain and Germany and Holland and Italy and</p>
<p>Portugal, unwilling regiments were driven northward, that the</p>
<p>wounded pride of the great Emperor might be duly avenged.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is common knowledge. After a march</p>
<p>of two months, Napoleon reached the Russian capital and</p>
<p>established his headquarters in the holy Kremlin. On the night</p>
<p>of September 15 of the year 1812, Moscow caught fire. The</p>
<p>town burned four days. When the evening of the fifth day</p>
<p>came, Napoleon gave the order for the retreat. Two weeks</p>
<p>later it began to snow. The army trudged through mud and</p>
<p>sleet until November the 26th when the river Berezina was</p>
<p>reached. Then the Russian attacks began in all seriousness.</p>
<p>The Cossacks swarmed around the ``Grande Armee&#x27;&#x27; which</p>
<p>was no longer an army but a mob. In the middle of December</p>
<p>the first of the survivors began to be seen in the German cities</p>
<p>of the East.</p>
<p>Then there were many rumours of an impending revolt.</p>
<p><code>The time has come,&#x27;&#x27; the people of Europe said, </code>to free ourselves</p>
<p>from this insufferable yoke.&#x27;&#x27; And they began to look</p>
<p>for old shotguns which had escaped the eye of the ever-present</p>
<p>French spies. But ere they knew what had happened, Napoleon</p>
<p>was back with a new army. He had left his defeated soldiers</p>
<p>and in his little sleigh had rushed ahead to Paris, making</p>
<p>a final appeal for more troops that he might defend the sacred</p>
<p>soil of France against foreign invasion.</p>
<p>Children of sixteen and seventeen followed him when he</p>
<p>moved eastward to meet the allied powers. On October 16,</p>
<p>18, and 19 of the year 1813, the terrible battle of Leipzig took</p>
<p>place where for three days boys in green and boys in blue</p>
<p>fought each other until the Elbe ran red with blood. On the</p>
<p>afternoon of the 17th of October, the massed reserves of Russian</p>
<p>infantry broke through the French lines and Napoleon</p>
<p>fled.</p>
<p>Back to Paris he went. He abdicated in favour of his small</p>
<p>son, but the allied powers insisted that Louis XVIII, the</p>
<p>brother of the late king Louis XVI, should occupy the French</p>
<p>throne, and surrounded by Cossacks and Uhlans, the dull-eyed</p>
<p>Bourbon prince made his triumphal entry into Paris.</p>
<p>As for Napoleon he was made the sovereign ruler of the</p>
<p>little island of Elba in the Mediterranean where he organised</p>
<p>his stable boys into a miniature army and fought battles on a</p>
<p>chess board.</p>
<p>But no sooner had he left France than the people began</p>
<p>to realise what they had lost. The last twenty years, however</p>
<p>costly, had been a period of great glory. Paris had been the</p>
<p>capital of the world. The fat Bourbon king who had learned</p>
<p>nothing and had forgotten nothing during the days of his</p>
<p>exile disgusted everybody by his indolence.</p>
<p>On the first of March of the year 1815, when the representatives</p>
<p>of the allies were ready to begin the work of unscrambling</p>
<p>the map of Europe, Napoleon suddenly landed near</p>
<p>Cannes. In less than a week the French army had deserted</p>
<p>the Bourbons and had rushed southward to offer their swords</p>
<p>and bayonets to the ``little Corporal.&#x27;&#x27; Napoleon marched</p>
<p>straight to Paris where he arrived on the twentieth of March.</p>
<p>This time he was more cautious. He offered peace, but the</p>
<p>allies insisted upon war. The whole of Europe arose against</p>
<p>the ``perfidious Corsican.&#x27;&#x27; Rapidly the Emperor marched</p>
<p>northward that he might crush his enemies before they should</p>
<p>be able to unite their forces. But Napoleon was no longer his</p>
<p>old self. He felt sick. He got tired easily. He slept when he</p>
<p>ought to have been up directing the attack of his advance-</p>
<p>guard. Besides, he missed many of his faithful old generals.</p>
<p>They were dead.</p>
<p>Early in June his armies entered Belgium. On the 16th</p>
<p>of that month he defeated the Prussians under Blucher. But</p>
<p>a subordinate commander failed to destroy the retreating army</p>
<p>as he had been ordered to do.</p>
<p>Two days later, Napoleon met Wellington near Waterloo.</p>
<p>It was the 18th of June, a Sunday. At two o&#x27;clock of the</p>
<p>afternoon, the battle seemed won for the French. At three a</p>
<p>speck of dust appeared upon the eastern horizon. Napoleon</p>
<p>believed that this meant the approach of his own cavalry who</p>
<p>would now turn the English defeat into a rout. At four o&#x27;clock</p>
<p>he knew better. Cursing and swearing, old Blucher drove</p>
<p>his deathly tired troops into the heart of the fray. The shock</p>
<p>broke the ranks of the guards. Napoleon had no further reserves.</p>
<p>He told his men to save themselves as best they could,</p>
<p>and he fled.</p>
<p>For a second time, he abdicated in favor of his son. Just</p>
<p>one hundred days after his escape from Elba, he was making</p>
<p>for the coast. He intended to go to America. In the year</p>
<p>1803, for a mere song, he had sold the French colony of</p>
<p>Louisiana (which was in great danger of being captured by</p>
<p>the English) to the young American Republic. ``The Americans,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>so he said, ``will be grateful and will give me a little bit</p>
<p>of land and a house where I may spend the last days of my life</p>
<p>in peace and quiet.&#x27;&#x27; But the English fleet was watching all</p>
<p>French harbours. Caught between the armies of the Allies</p>
<p>and the ships of the British, Napoleon had no choice. The</p>
<p>Prussians intended to shoot him. The English might be more</p>
<p>generous. At Rochefort he waited in the hope that something</p>
<p>might turn up. One month after Waterloo, he received orders</p>
<p>from the new French government to leave French soil inside</p>
<p>of twenty-four hours. Always the tragedian, he wrote a letter</p>
<p>to the Prince Regent of England (George IV, the king, was</p>
<p>in an insane asylum) informing His Royal Highness of his</p>
<p>intention to ``throw himself upon the mercy of his enemies and</p>
<p>like Themistocles, to look for a welcome at the fireside of his</p>
<p>foes . . .</p>
<p>On the 15th of July he went on board the ``Bellerophon,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>and surrendered his sword to Admiral Hotham. At Plymouth</p>
<p>he was transferred to the ``Northumberland&#x27;&#x27; which carried him</p>
<p>to St. Helena. There he spent the last seven years of his</p>
<p>life. He tried to write his memoirs, he quarrelled with his</p>
<p>keepers and he dreamed of past times. Curiously enough he</p>
<p>returned (at least in his imagination) to his original point of</p>
<p>departure. He remembered the days when he had fought the</p>
<p>battles of the Revolution. He tried to convince himself that</p>
<p>he had always been the true friend of those great principles of</p>
<p>``Liberty, Fraternity and Equality&#x27;&#x27; which the ragged soldiers</p>
<p>of the convention had carried to the ends of the earth. He</p>
<p>liked to dwell upon his career as Commander-in-Chief and</p>
<p>Consul. He rarely spoke of the Empire. Sometimes he</p>
<p>thought of his son, the Duke of Reichstadt, the little eagle,</p>
<p>who lived in Vienna, where he was treated as a ``poor relation&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>by his young Habsburg cousins, whose fathers had trembled at</p>
<p>the very mention of the name of Him. When the end came,</p>
<p>he was leading his troops to victory. He ordered Ney to attack</p>
<p>with the guards. Then he died.</p>
<p>But if you want an explanation of this strange career, if</p>
<p>you really wish to know how one man could possibly rule so</p>
<p>many people for so many years by the sheer force of his will,</p>
<p>do not read the books that have been written about him. Their</p>
<p>authors either hated the Emperor or loved him. You will</p>
<p>learn many facts, but it is more important to ``feel history&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>than to know it. Don&#x27;t read, but wait until you have a chance</p>
<p>to hear a good artist sing the song called ``The Two Grenadiers.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The words were written by Heine, the great German</p>
<p>poet who lived through the Napoleonic era. The music was</p>
<p>composed by Schumann, a German who saw the Emperor,</p>
<p>the enemy of his country, whenever he came to visit his imperial</p>
<p>father-in-law. The song therefore is the work of two</p>
<p>men who had every reason to hate the tyrant.</p>
<p>Go and hear it. Then you will understand what a thousand</p>
<p>volumes could not possibly tell you.</p>
<p>THE HOLY ALLIANCE</p>
<p>AS SOON AS NAPOLEON HAD BEEN SENT TO</p>
<p>ST. HELENA THE RULERS WHO SO OFTEN</p>
<p>HAD BEEN DEFEATED BY THE HATED</p>
<p>``CORSICAN&#x27;&#x27; MET AT VIENNA AND TRIED</p>
<p>TO UNDO THE MANY CHANGES THAT HAD</p>
<p>BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE FRENCH</p>
<p>REVOLUTION</p>
<p>THE Imperial Highnesses, the Royal Highnesses, their</p>
<p>Graces the Dukes, the Ministers Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary,</p>
<p>together with the plain Excellencies and their army</p>
<p>of secretaries, servants and hangers-on, whose labours had</p>
<p>been so rudely interrupted by the sudden return of the terrible</p>
<p>Corsican (now sweltering under the hot sun of St. Helena)</p>
<p>went back to their jobs. The victory was duly celebrated with</p>
<p>dinners, garden parties and balls at which the new and very</p>
<p>shocking ``waltz&#x27;&#x27; was danced to the great scandal of the ladies</p>
<p>and gentlemen who remembered the minuet of the old Regime.</p>
<p>For almost a generation they had lived in retirement. At</p>
<p>last the danger was over. They were very eloquent upon the</p>
<p>subject of the terrible hardships which they had suffered.</p>
<p>And they expected to be recompensed for every penny they</p>
<p>had lost at the hands of the unspeakable Jacobins who had</p>
<p>dared to kill their anointed king, who had abolished wigs and</p>
<p>who had discarded the short trousers of the court of Versailles</p>
<p>for the ragged pantaloons of the Parisian slums.</p>
<p>You may think it absurd that I should mention such a</p>
<p>detail. But, if you please, the Congress of Vienna was one</p>
<p>long succession of such absurdities and for many months the</p>
<p>question of ``short trousers vs. long trousers&#x27;&#x27; interested the</p>
<p>delegates more than the future settlement of the Saxon or</p>
<p>Spanish problems. His Majesty the King of Prussia went so</p>
<p>far as to order a pair of short ones, that he might give public</p>
<p>evidence of his contempt for everything revolutionary.</p>
<p>Another German potentate, not to be outdone in this noble</p>
<p>hatred for the revolution, decreed that all taxes which his subjects</p>
<p>had paid to the French usurper should be paid a second</p>
<p>time to the legitimate ruler who had loved his people from afar</p>
<p>while they were at the mercy of the Corsican ogre. And so on.</p>
<p>From one blunder to another, until one gasps and exclaims</p>
<p>``but why in the name of High Heaven did not the people</p>
<p>object?&#x27;&#x27; Why not indeed? Because the people were utterly</p>
<p>exhausted, were desperate, did not care what happened or how</p>
<p>or where or by whom they were ruled, provided there was</p>
<p>peace. They were sick and tired of war and revolution and</p>
<p>reform.</p>
<p>In the eighties of the previous century they had all danced</p>
<p>around the tree of liberty. Princes had embraced their cooks</p>
<p>and Duchesses had danced the Carmagnole with their lackeys</p>
<p>in the honest belief that the Millennium of Equality and</p>
<p>Fraternity had at last dawned upon this wicked world. Instead of</p>
<p>the Millennium they had been visited by the Revolutionary</p>
<p>commissary who had lodged a dozen dirty soldiers in their parlor</p>
<p>and had stolen the family plate when he returned to Paris to</p>
<p>report to his government upon the enthusiasm with which the</p>
<p>``liberated country&#x27;&#x27; had received the Constitution, which the</p>
<p>French people had presented to their good neighbours.</p>
<p>When they had heard how the last outbreak of revolutionary</p>
<p>disorder in Paris had been suppressed by a young officer, called</p>
<p>Bonaparte, or Buonaparte, who had turned his guns upon the</p>
<p>mob, they gave a sigh of relief. A little less liberty, fraternity</p>
<p>and equality seemed a very desirable thing. But ere long, the</p>
<p>young officer called Buonaparte or Bonaparte became one of</p>
<p>the three consuls of the French Republic, then sole consul and</p>
<p>finally Emperor. As he was much more efficient than any</p>
<p>ruler that had ever been seen before, his hand pressed heavily</p>
<p>upon his poor subjects. He showed them no mercy. He impressed</p>
<p>their sons into his armies, he married their daughters</p>
<p>to his generals and he took their pictures and their statues to</p>
<p>enrich his own museums. He turned the whole of Europe</p>
<p>into an armed camp and killed almost an entire generation of</p>
<p>men.</p>
<p>Now he was gone, and the people (except a few professional</p>
<p>military men) had but one wish. They wanted to be let alone.</p>
<p>For awhile they had been allowed to rule themselves, to vote</p>
<p>for mayors and aldermen and judges. The system had been a</p>
<p>terrible failure. The new rulers had been inexperienced and</p>
<p>extravagant. From sheer despair the people turned to the</p>
<p>representative men of the old Regime. ``You rule us,&#x27;&#x27; they</p>
<p>said, ``as you used to do. Tell us what we owe you for taxes</p>
<p>and leave us alone. We are busy repairing the damage of the</p>
<p>age of liberty.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The men who stage-managed the famous congress certainly</p>
<p>did their best to satisfy this longing for rest and quiet.</p>
<p>The Holy Alliance, the main result of the Congress, made the</p>
<p>policeman the most important dignitary of the State and held</p>
<p>out the most terrible punishment to those who dared criticise a</p>
<p>single official act.</p>
<p>Europe had peace, but it was the peace of the cemetery.</p>
<p>The three most important men at Vienna were the Emperor</p>
<p>Alexander of Russia, Metternich, who represented the</p>
<p>interests of the Austrian house of Habsburg, and Talleyrand,</p>
<p>the erstwhile bishop of Autun, who had managed to live</p>
<p>through the different changes in the French government by</p>
<p>the sheer force of his cunning and his intelligence and who</p>
<p>now travelled to the Austrian capital to save for his country</p>
<p>whatever could be saved from the Napoleonic ruin. Like the</p>
<p>gay young man of the limerick, who never knew when he was</p>
<p>slighted, this unbidden guest came to the party and ate just as</p>
<p>heartily as if he had been really invited. Indeed, before long,</p>
<p>he was sitting at the head of the table entertaining everybody</p>
<p>with his amusing stories and gaining the company&#x27;s good will</p>
<p>by the charm of his manner.</p>
<p>Before he had been in Vienna twenty-four hours he knew</p>
<p>that the allies were divided into two hostile camps. On the</p>
<p>one side were Russia, who wanted to take Poland, and Prussia,</p>
<p>who wanted to annex Saxony; and on the other side were</p>
<p>Austria and England, who were trying to prevent this grab</p>
<p>because it was against their own interest that either Prussia or</p>
<p>Russia should be able to dominate Europe. Talleyrand played</p>
<p>the two sides against each other with great skill and it was due</p>
<p>to his efforts that the French people were not made to suffer</p>
<p>for the ten years of oppression which Europe had endured at</p>
<p>the hands of the Imperial officials. He argued that the French</p>
<p>people had been given no choice in the matter. Napoleon had</p>
<p>forced them to act at his bidding. But Napoleon was gone and</p>
<p>Louis XVIII was on the throne. ``Give him a chance,&#x27;&#x27; Talleyrand</p>
<p>pleaded. And the Allies, glad to see a legitimate king</p>
<p>upon the throne of a revolutionary country, obligingly yielded</p>
<p>and the Bourbons were given their chance, of which they</p>
<p>made such use that they were driven out after fifteen years.</p>
<p>The second man of the triumvirate of Vienna was Metternich,</p>
<p>the Austrian prime minister, the leader of the foreign</p>
<p>policy of the house of Habsburg. Wenzel Lothar, Prince of</p>
<p>Metternich-Winneburg, was exactly what the name suggests.</p>
<p>He was a Grand Seigneur, a very handsome gentleman with</p>
<p>very fine manners, immensely rich, and very able, but the</p>
<p>product of a society which lived a thousand miles away from</p>
<p>the sweating multitudes who worked and slaved in the cities</p>
<p>and on the farms. As a young man, Metternich had been</p>
<p>studying at the University of Strassburg when the French</p>
<p>Revolution broke out. Strassburg, the city which gave birth</p>
<p>to the Marseillaise, had been a centre of Jacobin activities.</p>
<p>Metternich remembered that his pleasant social life had been</p>
<p>sadly interrupted, that a lot of incompetent citizens had suddenly</p>
<p>been called forth to perform tasks for which they were</p>
<p>not fit, that the mob had celebrated the dawn of the new liberty</p>
<p>by the murder of perfectly innocent persons. He had failed to</p>
<p>see the honest enthusiasm of the masses, the ray of hope in the</p>
<p>eyes of women and children who carried bread and water to</p>
<p>the ragged troops of the Convention, marching through the</p>
<p>city on their way to the front and a glorious death for the</p>
<p>French Fatherland.</p>
<p>The whole thing had filled the young Austrian with disgust.</p>
<p>It was uncivilised. If there were any fighting to be done it</p>
<p>must be done by dashing young men in lovely uniforms, charging</p>
<p>across the green fields on well-groomed horses. But to</p>
<p>turn an entire country into an evil-smelling armed camp where</p>
<p>tramps were overnight promoted to be generals, that was both</p>
<p>wicked and senseless. ``See what came of all your fine ideas,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>he would say to the French diplomats whom he met at a quiet</p>
<p>little dinner given by one of the innumerable Austrian grand-</p>
<p>dukes. ``You wanted liberty, equality and fraternity and you</p>
<p>got Napoleon. How much better it would have been if you</p>
<p>had been contented with the existing order of things.&#x27;&#x27; And</p>
<p>he would explain his system of ``stability.&#x27;&#x27; He would advocate</p>
<p>a return to the normalcy of the good old days before the</p>
<p>war, when everybody was happy and nobody talked nonsense</p>
<p>about ``everybody being as good as everybody else.&#x27;&#x27; In this</p>
<p>attitude he was entirely sincere and as he was an able man of</p>
<p>great strength of will and a tremendous power of persuasion,</p>
<p>he was one of the most dangerous enemies of the Revolutionary</p>
<p>ideas. He did not die until the year 1859, and he therefore</p>
<p>lived long enough to see the complete failure of all his policies</p>
<p>when they were swept aside by the revolution of the year 1848.</p>
<p>He then found himself the most hated man of Europe and</p>
<p>more than once ran the risk of being lynched by angry crowds</p>
<p>of outraged citizens. But until the very last, he remained steadfast</p>
<p>in his belief that he had done the right thing.</p>
<p>He had always been convinced that people preferred peace</p>
<p>to liberty and he had tried to give them what was best for them.</p>
<p>And in all fairness, it ought to be said that his efforts to</p>
<p>establish universal peace were fairly successful. The great powers</p>
<p>did not fly at each other&#x27;s throat for almost forty years, indeed</p>
<p>not until the Crimean war between Russia and England,</p>
<p>France and Italy and Turkey, in the year 1854. That means</p>
<p>a record for the European continent.</p>
<p>The third hero of this waltzing congress was the Emperor</p>
<p>Alexander. He had been brought up at the court of his grand-</p>
<p>mother, the famous Catherine the Great. Between the lessons</p>
<p>of this shrewd old woman, who taught him to regard the glory</p>
<p>of Russia as the most important thing in life, and those of his</p>
<p>private tutor, a Swiss admirer of Voltaire and Rousseau, who</p>
<p>filled his mind with a general love of humanity, the boy grew</p>
<p>up to be a strange mixture of a selfish tyrant and a sentimental</p>
<p>revolutionist. He had suffered great indignities during the</p>
<p>life of his crazy father, Paul I. He had been obliged to wit-</p>
<p>ness the wholesale slaughter of the Napoleonic battle-fields.</p>
<p>Then the tide had turned. His armies had won the day for the</p>
<p>Allies. Russia had become the saviour of Europe and the Tsar</p>
<p>of this mighty people was acclaimed as a half-god who would</p>
<p>cure the world of its many ills.</p>
<p>But Alexander was not very clever. He did not know</p>
<p>men and women as Talleyrand and Metternich knew them.</p>
<p>He did not understand the strange game of diplomacy. He</p>
<p>was vain (who would not be under the circumstances?) and</p>
<p>loved to hear the applause of the multitude and soon he had</p>
<p>become the main ``attraction&#x27;&#x27; of the Congress while Metternich</p>
<p>and Talleyrand and Castlereagh (the very able British</p>
<p>representative) sat around a table and drank a bottle of Tokay</p>
<p>and decided what was actually going to be done. They needed</p>
<p>Russia and therefore they were very polite to Alexander, but</p>
<p>the less he had personally to do with the actual work of the</p>
<p>Congress, the better they were pleased. They even encouraged</p>
<p>his plans for a Holy Alliance that he might be fully occupied</p>
<p>while they were engaged upon the work at hand.</p>
<p>Alexander was a sociable person who liked to go to parties</p>
<p>and meet people. Upon such occasions he was happy and gay</p>
<p>but there was a very different element in his character. He</p>
<p>tried to forget something which he could not forget. On the</p>
<p>night of the 23rd of March of the year 1801 he had been sitting</p>
<p>in a room of the St. Michael Palace in Petersburg, waiting for</p>
<p>the news of his father&#x27;s abdication. But Paul had refused to</p>
<p>sign the document which the drunken officers had placed before</p>
<p>him on the table, and in their rage they had put a scarf</p>
<p>around his neck and had strangled him to death. Then they</p>
<p>had gone downstairs to tell Alexander that he was Emperor of</p>
<p>all the Russian lands.</p>
<p>The memory of this terrible night stayed with the Tsar</p>
<p>who was a very sensitive person. He had been educated in</p>
<p>the school of the great French philosophers who did not believe</p>
<p>in God but in Human Reason. But Reason alone could</p>
<p>not satisfy the Emperor in his predicament. He began to</p>
<p>hear voices and see things. He tried to find a way by which</p>
<p>he could square himself with his conscience. He became very</p>
<p>pious and began to take an interest in mysticism, that strange</p>
<p>love of the mysterious and the unknown which is as old as the</p>
<p>temples of Thebes and Babylon.</p>
<p>The tremendous emotion of the great revolutionary era</p>
<p>had influenced the character of the people of that day in a</p>
<p>strange way. Men and women who had lived through twenty</p>
<p>years of anxiety and fear were no longer quite normal. They</p>
<p>jumped whenever the door-bell rang. It might mean the news</p>
<p>of the ``death on the field of honour&#x27;&#x27; of an only son. The</p>
<p>phrases about <code>brotherly love&#x27;&#x27; and </code>liberty&#x27;&#x27; of the Revolution</p>
<p>were hollow words in the ears of sorely stricken peasants.</p>
<p>They clung to anything that might give them a new hold on</p>
<p>the terrible problems of life. In their grief and misery they</p>
<p>were easily imposed upon by a large number of imposters</p>
<p>who posed as prophets and preached a strange new doctrine</p>
<p>which they dug out of the more obscure passages of the Book</p>
<p>of Revelations.</p>
<p>In the year 1814, Alexander, who had already consulted a</p>
<p>large number of wonder-doctors, heard of a new seeress who</p>
<p>was foretelling the coming doom of the world and was exhorting</p>
<p>people to repent ere it be too late. The Baroness von</p>
<p>Krudener, the lady in question, was a Russian woman of uncertain</p>
<p>age and similar reputation who had been the wife of a</p>
<p>Russian diplomat in the days of the Emperor Paul. She had</p>
<p>squandered her husband&#x27;s money and had disgraced him by</p>
<p>her strange love affairs. She had lived a very dissolute life</p>
<p>until her nerves had given way and for a while she was not in</p>
<p>her right mind. Then she had been converted by the sight of</p>
<p>the sudden death of a friend. Thereafter she despised all</p>
<p>gaiety. She confessed her former sins to her shoemaker, a</p>
<p>pious Moravian brother, a follower of the old reformer John</p>
<p>Huss, who had been burned for his heresies by the Council of</p>
<p>Constance in the year 1415.</p>
<p>The next ten years the Baroness spent in Germany making</p>
<p>a specialty of the ``conversion&#x27;&#x27; of kings and princes. To convince</p>
<p>Alexander, the Saviour of Europe, of the error of his</p>
<p>ways was the greatest ambition of her life. And as Alexander,</p>
<p>in his misery, was willing to listen to anybody who brought him</p>
<p>a ray of hope, the interview was easily arranged. On the evening</p>
<p>of the fourth of June of the year 1815, she was admitted</p>
<p>to the tent of the Emperor. She found him reading his Bible.</p>
<p>We do not know what she said to Alexander, but when she</p>
<p>left him three hours later, he was bathed in tears, and vowed</p>
<p>that ``at last his soul had found peace.&#x27;&#x27; From that day on the</p>
<p>Baroness was his faithful companion and his spiritual adviser.</p>
<p>She followed him to Paris and then to Vienna and the time</p>
<p>which Alexander did not spend dancing he spent at the</p>
<p>Krudener prayer-meetings.</p>
<p>You may ask why I tell you this story in such great detail?</p>
<p>Are not the social changes of the nineteenth century of greater</p>
<p>importance than the career of an ill-balanced woman who had</p>
<p>better be forgotten? Of course they are, but there exist any</p>
<p>number of books which will tell you of these other things with</p>
<p>great accuracy and in great detail. I want you to learn something</p>
<p>more from this history than a mere succession of facts.</p>
<p>I want you to approach all historical events in a frame of mind</p>
<p>that will take nothing for granted. Don&#x27;t be satisfied with</p>
<p>the mere statement that ``such and such a thing happened then</p>
<p>and there.&#x27;&#x27; Try to discover the hidden motives behind every</p>
<p>action and then you will understand the world around you</p>
<p>much better and you will have a greater chance to help others,</p>
<p>which (when all is said and done) is the only truly satisfactory</p>
<p>way of living.</p>
<p>I do not want you to think of the Holy Alliance as a piece</p>
<p>of paper which was signed in the year 1815 and lies dead and</p>
<p>forgotten somewhere in the archives of state. It may be forgotten</p>
<p>but it is by no means dead. The Holy Alliance was</p>
<p>directly responsible for the promulgation of the Monroe</p>
<p>Doctrine, and the Monroe Doctrine of America for the Americans</p>
<p>has a very distinct bearing upon your own life. That is</p>
<p>the reason why I want you to know exactly how this document</p>
<p>happened to come into existence and what the real motives were</p>
<p>underlying this outward manifestation of piety and Christian</p>
<p>devotion to duty.</p>
<p>The Holy Alliance was the joint labour of an unfortunate</p>
<p>man who had suffered a terrible mental shock and who was</p>
<p>trying to pacify his much-disturbed soul, and of an ambitious</p>
<p>woman who after a wasted life had lost her beauty and her</p>
<p>attraction and who satisfied her vanity and her desire for</p>
<p>notoriety by assuming the role of self-appointed Messiah of a</p>
<p>new and strange creed. I am not giving away any secrets</p>
<p>when I tell you these details. Such sober minded people as</p>
<p>Castlereagh, Metternich and Talleyrand fully understood</p>
<p>the limited abilities of the sentimental Baroness. It would have</p>
<p>been easy for Metternich to send her back to her German</p>
<p>estates. A few lines to the almighty commander of the imperial</p>
<p>police and the thing was done.</p>
<p>But France and England and Austria depended upon the</p>
<p>good-will of Russia. They could not afford to offend Alexander.</p>
<p>And they tolerated the silly old Baroness because they</p>
<p>had to. And while they regarded the Holy Alliance as utter</p>
<p>rubbish and not worth the paper upon which it was written,</p>
<p>they listened patiently to the Tsar when he read them the first</p>
<p>rough draft of this attempt to create the Brotherhood of Men</p>
<p>upon a basis of the Holy Scriptures. For this is what the</p>
<p>Holy Alliance tried to do, and the signers of the document</p>
<p>solemnly declared that they would ``in the administration of</p>
<p>their respective states and in their political relations with every</p>
<p>other government take for their sole guide the precepts of that</p>
<p>Holy Religion, namely the precepts of Justice, Christian</p>
<p>Charity and Peace, which far from being applicable only to</p>
<p>private concerns must have an immediate influence on the</p>
<p>councils of princes, and must guide all their steps as being the</p>
<p>only means of consolidating human institutions and remedying</p>
<p>their imperfections.&#x27;&#x27; They then proceeded to promise each</p>
<p>other that they would remain united ``by the bonds of a true</p>
<p>and indissoluble fraternity, and considering each other as</p>
<p>fellow-countrymen, they would on all occasions and in all places</p>
<p>lend each other aid and assistance.&#x27;&#x27; And more words to the</p>
<p>same effect.</p>
<p>Eventually the Holy Alliance was signed by the Emperor</p>
<p>of Austria, who did not understand a word of it. It was signed</p>
<p>by the Bourbons who needed the friendship of Napoleon&#x27;s old</p>
<p>enemies. It was signed by the King of Prussia, who hoped to</p>
<p>gain Alexander for his plans for a ``greater Prussia,&#x27;&#x27; and by</p>
<p>all the little nations of Europe who were at the mercy of Russia.</p>
<p>England never signed, because Castlereagh thought the</p>
<p>whole thing buncombe. The Pope did not sign because he</p>
<p>resented this interference in his business by a Greek-Orthodox</p>
<p>and a Protestant. And the Sultan did not sign because he</p>
<p>never heard of it.</p>
<p>The general mass of the European people, however, soon</p>
<p>were forced to take notice. Behind the hollow phrases of the</p>
<p>Holy Alliance stood the armies of the Quintuple Alliance</p>
<p>which Metternich had created among the great powers. These</p>
<p>armies meant business. They let it be known that the peace</p>
<p>of Europe must not be disturbed by the so-called liberals who</p>
<p>were in reality nothing but disguised Jacobins, and hoped for</p>
<p>a return of the revolutionary days. The enthusiasm for the</p>
<p>great wars of liberation of the years 1812, 1818, 1814 and</p>
<p>1815 had begun to wear off. It had been followed by a sincere</p>
<p>belief in the coming of a happier day. The soldiers who had</p>
<p>borne the brunt of the battle wanted peace and they said so.</p>
<p>But they did not want the sort of peace which the Holy</p>
<p>Alliance and the Council of the European powers had now</p>
<p>bestowed upon them. They cried that they had been betrayed.</p>
<p>But they were careful lest they be heard by a secret-police spy.</p>
<p>The reaction was victorious. It was a reaction caused by men</p>
<p>who sincerely believed that their methods were necessary for</p>
<p>the good of humanity. But it was just as hard to bear as if</p>
<p>their intentions had been less kind. And it caused a great deal</p>
<p>of unnecessary suffering and greatly retarded the orderly</p>
<p>progress of political development.</p>
<p>THE GREAT REACTION</p>
<p>THEY TRIED TO ASSURE THE WORLD AN ERA</p>
<p>OF UNDISTURBED PEACE BY SUPPRESSING</p>
<p>ALL NEW IDEAS. THEY MADE THE</p>
<p>POLICE-SPY THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONARY</p>
<p>IN THE STATE AND SOON THE PRISONS</p>
<p>OF ALL COUNTRIES WERE FILLED WITH</p>
<p>THOSE WHO CLAIMED THAT PEOPLE</p>
<p>HAVE THE RIGHT TO GOVERN THEMSELVES</p>
<p>AS THEY SEE FIT</p>
<p>To undo the damage done by the great Napoleonic flood</p>
<p>was almost impossible. Age-old fences had been washed away.</p>
<p>The palaces of two score dynasties had been damaged to such</p>
<p>an extent that they had to be condemned as uninhabitable.</p>
<p>Other royal residences had been greatly enlarged at the expense</p>
<p>of less fortunate neighbours. Strange odds and ends</p>
<p>of revolutionary doctrine had been left behind by the receding</p>
<p>waters and could not be dislodged without danger to the entire</p>
<p>community. But the political engineers of the Congress did</p>
<p>the best they could and this is what they accomplished.</p>
<p>France had disturbed the peace of the world for so many</p>
<p>years that people had come to fear that country almost</p>
<p>instinctively. The Bourbons, through the mouth of Talleyrand,</p>
<p>had promised to be good, but the Hundred Days had taught</p>
<p>Europe what to expect should Napoleon manage to escape for</p>
<p>a second time. The Dutch Republic, therefore, was changed</p>
<p>into a Kingdom, and Belgium (which had not joined the Dutch</p>
<p>struggle for independence in the sixteenth century and since</p>
<p>then had been part of the Habsburg domains, firs t under Spanish</p>
<p>rule and thereafter under Austrian rule) was made part</p>
<p>of this new kingdom of the Netherlands. Nobody wanted this</p>
<p>union either in the Protestant North or in the Catholic South,</p>
<p>but no questions were asked. It seemed good for the peace</p>
<p>of Europe and that was the main consideration.</p>
<p>Poland had hoped for great things because a Pole, Prince</p>
<p>Adam Czartoryski, was one of the most intimate friends of</p>
<p>Tsar Alexander and had been his constant advisor during the</p>
<p>war and at the Congress of Vienna. But Poland was made a</p>
<p>semi-independent part of Russia with Alexander as her king.</p>
<p>This solution pleased no one and caused much bitter feeling</p>
<p>and three revolutions.</p>
<p>Denmark, which had remained a faithful ally of Napoleon</p>
<p>until the end, was severely punished. Seven years before, an</p>
<p>English fleet had sailed down the Kattegat and without a</p>
<p>declaration of war or any warning had bombarded Copenhagen</p>
<p>and had taken away the Danish fleet, lest it be of value to</p>
<p>Napoleon. The Congress of Vienna went one step further.</p>
<p>It took Norway (which since the union of Calmar of the year</p>
<p>1397 had been united with Denmark) away from Denmark</p>
<p>and gave it to Charles XIV of Sweden as a reward for his betrayal</p>
<p>of Napoleon, who had set him up in the king business.</p>
<p>This Swedish king, curiously enough, was a former French general</p>
<p>by the name of Bernadotte, who had come to Sweden as one</p>
<p>of Napolean&#x27;s{sic} adjutants, and had been invited to the throne of</p>
<p>that good country when the last of the rulers of the house of</p>
<p>Hollstein-Gottorp had died without leaving either son or</p>
<p>daughter. From 1815 until 1844 he ruled his adopted country</p>
<p>(the language of which he never learned) width great ability. He</p>
<p>was a clever man and enjoyed the respect of both his Swedish</p>
<p>and his Norwegian subjects, but he did not succeed in joining</p>
<p>two countries which nature and history had put asunder. The</p>
<p>dual Scandinavian state was never a success and in 1905,</p>
<p>Norway, in a most peaceful and orderly manner, set up as an</p>
<p>independent kingdom and the Swedes bade her ``good speed&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>and very wisely let her go her own way.</p>
<p>The Italians, who since the days of the Renaissance had</p>
<p>been at the mercy of a long series of invaders, also had put</p>
<p>great hopes in General Bonaparte. The Emperor Napoleon,</p>
<p>however, had grievously disappointed them. Instead of the</p>
<p>United Italy which the people wanted, they had been divided</p>
<p>into a number of little principalities, duchies, republics and</p>
<p>the Papal State, which (next to Naples) was the worst governed</p>
<p>and most miserable region of the entire peninsula. The</p>
<p>Congress of Vienna abolished a few of the Napoleonic republics</p>
<p>and in their place resurrected several old principalities</p>
<p>which were given to deserving members, both male and female,</p>
<p>of the Habsburg family.</p>
<p>The poor Spaniards, who had started the great nationalistic</p>
<p>revolt against Napoleon, and who had sacrificed the best blood</p>
<p>of the country for their king, were punished severely when the</p>
<p>Congress allowed His Majesty to return to his domains. This</p>
<p>vicious creature, known as Ferdinand VII, had spent the last</p>
<p>four years of his life as a prisoner of Napoleon. He had improved</p>
<p>his days by knitting garments for the statues of his</p>
<p>favourite patron saints. He celebrated his return by re-introducing</p>
<p>the Inquisition and the torture-chamber, both of which</p>
<p>had been abolished by the Revolution. He was a disgusting</p>
<p>person, despised as much by his subjects as by his four wives,</p>
<p>but the Holy Alliance maintained him upon his legitimate</p>
<p>throne and all efforts of the decent Spaniards to get rid of this</p>
<p>curse and make Spain a constitutional kingdom ended in</p>
<p>bloodshed and executions.</p>
<p>Portugal had been without a king since the year 1807 when</p>
<p>the royal family had fled to the colonies in Brazil. The country</p>
<p>had been used as a base of supply for the armies of</p>
<p>Wellington during the Peninsula war, which lasted from 1808</p>
<p>until 1814. After 1815 Portugal continued to be a sort of</p>
<p>British province until the house of Braganza returned to the</p>
<p>throne, leaving one of its members behind in Rio de Janeiro</p>
<p>as Emperor of Brazil, the only American Empire which lasted</p>
<p>for more than a few years, and which came to an end in 1889</p>
<p>when the country became a republic.</p>
<p>In the east, nothing was done to improve the terrible conditions</p>
<p>of both the Slavs and the Greeks who were still subjects</p>
<p>of the Sultan. In the year 1804 Black George, a Servian</p>
<p>swineherd, (the founder of the Karageorgevich dynasty) had</p>
<p>started a revolt against the Turks, but he had been defeated</p>
<p>by his enemies and had been murdered by one of his supposed</p>
<p>friends, the rival Servian leader, called Milosh Obrenovich,</p>
<p>(who became the founder of the Obrenovich dynasty) and the</p>
<p>Turks had continued to be the undisputed masters of the</p>
<p>Balkans.</p>
<p>The Greeks, who since the loss of their independence, two</p>
<p>thousand years before, had been subjects of the Macedonians,</p>
<p>the Romans, the Venetians and the Turks, had hoped that their</p>
<p>countryman, Capo d&#x27;Istria, a native of Corfu and together</p>
<p>with Czartoryski, the most intimate personal friends of</p>
<p>Alexander, would do something for them. But the Congress</p>
<p>of Vienna was not interested in Greeks, but was very much</p>
<p>interested in keeping all ``legitimate&#x27;&#x27; monarchs, Christian,</p>
<p>Moslem and otherwise, upon their respective thrones. Therefore</p>
<p>nothing was done.</p>
<p>The last, but perhaps the greatest blunder of the Congress</p>
<p>was the treatment of Germany. The Reformation and the</p>
<p>Thirty Years War had not only destroyed the prosperity of the</p>
<p>country, but had turned it into a hopeless political rubbish</p>
<p>heap, consisting of a couple of kingdoms, a few grand-duchies,</p>
<p>a large number of duchies and hundreds of margravates, principalities,</p>
<p>baronies, electorates, free cities and free villages,</p>
<p>ruled by the strangest assortment of potentates that was ever</p>
<p>seen off the comic opera stage. Frederick the Great had</p>
<p>changed this when he created a strong Prussia, but this state</p>
<p>had not survived him by many years.</p>
<p>Napoleon had blue-penciled the demand for independence</p>
<p>of most of these little countries, and only fifty-two out of a</p>
<p>total of more than three hundred had survived the year 1806.</p>
<p>During the years of the great struggle for independence, many</p>
<p>a young soldier had dreamed of a new Fatherland that should</p>
<p>be strong and united. But there can be no union without a</p>
<p>strong leadership, and who was to be this leader?</p>
<p>There were five kingdoms in the German speaking lands.</p>
<p>The rulers of two of these, Austria and Prussia, were kings by</p>
<p>the Grace of God. The rulers of three others, Bavaria, Saxony</p>
<p>and Wurtemberg, were kings by the Grace of Napoleon, and</p>
<p>as they had been the faithful henchmen of the Emperor, their</p>
<p>patriotic credit with the other Germans was therefore not very</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>The Congress had established a new German Confederation,</p>
<p>a league of thirty-eight sovereign states, under the chairmanship</p>
<p>of the King of Austria, who was now known as the</p>
<p>Emperor of Austria. It was the sort of make-shift arrangement</p>
<p>which satisfied no one. It is true that a German Diet,</p>
<p>which met in the old coronation city of Frankfort. had been</p>
<p>created to discuss matters of ``common policy and importance.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>But in this Diet, thirty-eight delegates represented thirty-eight</p>
<p>different interests and as no decision could be taken without a</p>
<p>unanimous vote (a parliamentary rule which had in previous</p>
<p>centuries ruined the mighty kingdom of Poland), the famous</p>
<p>German Confederation became very soon the laughing stock</p>
<p>of Europe and the politics of the old Empire began to resemble</p>
<p>those of our Central American neighbours in the forties and</p>
<p>the fifties of the last century.</p>
<p>It was terribly humiliating to the people who had sacrificed</p>
<p>everything for a national ideal. But the Congress was not</p>
<p>interested in the private feelings of ``subjects,&#x27;&#x27; and the debate</p>
<p>was closed.</p>
<p>Did anybody object? Most assuredly. As soon as the first</p>
<p>feeling of hatred against Napoleon had quieted down--as soon</p>
<p>as the enthusiasm of the great war had subsided--as soon as</p>
<p>the people came to a full realisation of the crime that had been</p>
<p>committed in the name of ``peace and stability&#x27;&#x27; they began to</p>
<p>murmur. They even made threats of open revolt. But what</p>
<p>could they do? They were powerless. They were at the mercy</p>
<p>of the most pitiless and efficient police system the world had</p>
<p>ever seen.</p>
<p>The members of the Congress of Vienna honestly and sincerely</p>
<p>believed that ``the Revolutionary Principle had led to</p>
<p>the criminal usurpation of the throne by the former emperor</p>
<p>Napoleon.&#x27;&#x27; They felt that they were called upon to eradicate</p>
<p>the adherents of the so-called ``French ideas&#x27;&#x27; just as Philip II</p>
<p>had only followed the voice of his conscience when he burned</p>
<p>Protestants or hanged Moors. In the beginning of the sixteenth</p>
<p>century a man who did not believe in the divine right</p>
<p>of the Pope to rule his subjects as he saw fit was a ``heretic&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>and it was the duty of all loyal citizens to kill him. In the</p>
<p>beginning of the nineteenth century, on the continent of Europe,</p>
<p>a man who did not believe in the divine right of his king to</p>
<p>rule him as he or his Prime Minister saw fit, was a ``heretic,&#x27;&#x27; and</p>
<p>it was the duty of all loyal citizens to denounce him to the nearest</p>
<p>policeman and see that he got punished.</p>
<p>But the rulers of the year 1815 had learned efficiency in</p>
<p>the school of Napoleon and they performed their task much</p>
<p>better than it had been done in the year 1517. The period</p>
<p>between the year 1815 and the year 1860 was the great era of</p>
<p>the political spy. Spies were everywhere. They lived in palaces</p>
<p>and they were to be found in the lowest gin-shops. They</p>
<p>peeped through the key-holes of the ministerial cabinet and</p>
<p>they listened to the conversations of the people who were taking</p>
<p>the air on the benches of the Municipal Park. They guarded</p>
<p>the frontier so that no one might leave without a duly viseed</p>
<p>passport and they inspected all packages, that no books with</p>
<p>dangerous ``French ideas&#x27;&#x27; should enter the realm of their</p>
<p>Royal masters. They sat among the students in the lecture</p>
<p>hall and woe to the Professor who uttered a word against the</p>
<p>existing order of things. They followed the little boys and</p>
<p>girls on their way to church lest they play hookey.</p>
<p>In many of these tasks they were assisted by the clergy.</p>
<p>The church had suffered greatly during the days of the</p>
<p>revolution. The church property had been confiscated. Several</p>
<p>priests had been killed and the generation that had learned its</p>
<p>cathechism from Voltaire and Rousseau and the other French</p>
<p>philosophers had danced around the Altar of Reason when</p>
<p>the Committee of Public Safety had abolished the worship of</p>
<p>God in October of the year 1793. The priests had followed the</p>
<p>``emigres&#x27;&#x27; into their long exile. Now they returned in the</p>
<p>wake of the allied armies and they set to work with a vengeance.</p>
<p>Even the Jesuits came back in 1814 and resumed their</p>
<p>former labours of educating the young. Their order had been</p>
<p>a little too successful in its fight against the enemies of the</p>
<p>church. It had established ``provinces&#x27;&#x27; in every part of the</p>
<p>world, to teach the natives the blessings of Christianity, but</p>
<p>soon it had developed into a regular trading company which</p>
<p>was for ever interfering with the civil authorities. During the</p>
<p>reign of the Marquis de Pombal, the great reforming minister</p>
<p>of Portugal, they had been driven out of the Portuguese lands</p>
<p>and in the year 1773 at the request of most of the Catholic</p>
<p>powers of Europe, the order had been suppressed by Pope</p>
<p>Clement XIV. Now they were back on the job, and preached</p>
<p>the principles of <code>obedience&#x27;&#x27; and </code>love for the legitimate</p>
<p>dynasty&#x27;&#x27; to children whose parents had hired shopwindows that</p>
<p>they might laugh at Marie Antoinette driving to the scaffold</p>
<p>which was to end her misery.</p>
<p>But in the Protestant countries like Prussia, things were</p>
<p>not a whit better. The great patriotic leaders of the year 1812,</p>
<p>the poets and the writers who had preached a holy war upon the</p>
<p>usurper, were now branded as dangerous ``demagogues.&#x27;&#x27; Their</p>
<p>houses were searched. Their letters were read. They were</p>
<p>obliged to report to the police at regular intervals and give an</p>
<p>account of themselves. The Prussian drill master was let loose</p>
<p>in all his fury upon the younger generation. When a party of</p>
<p>students celebrated the tercentenary of the Reformation with</p>
<p>noisy but harmless festivities on the old Wartburg, the Prussian</p>
<p>bureaucrats had visions of an imminent revolution. When</p>
<p>a theological student, more honest than intelligent, killed a</p>
<p>Russian government spy who was operating in Germany, the</p>
<p>universities were placed under police-supervision and professors</p>
<p>were jailed or dismissed without any form of trial.</p>
<p>Russia, of course, was even more absurd in these anti-</p>
<p>revolutionary activities. Alexander had recovered from his attack</p>
<p>of piety. He was gradually drifting toward melancholia. He</p>
<p>well knew his own limited abilities and understood how at</p>
<p>Vienna he had been the victim both of Metternich and the</p>
<p>Krudener woman. More and more he turned his back upon the</p>
<p>west and became a truly Russian ruler whose interests lay in</p>
<p>Constantinople, the old holy city that had been the first teacher</p>
<p>of the Slavs. The older he grew, the harder he worked and the</p>
<p>less he was able to accomplish. And while he sat in his study,</p>
<p>his ministers turned the whole of Russia into a land of military</p>
<p>barracks.</p>
<p>It is not a pretty picture. Perhaps I might have shortened</p>
<p>this description of the Great Reaction. But it is just as well</p>
<p>that you should have a thorough knowledge of this era. It was</p>
<p>not the first time that an attempt had been made to set the</p>
<p>clock of history back. The result was the usual one.</p>
<p>NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE</p>
<p>THE LOVE OF NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE,</p>
<p>HOWEVER WAS TOO STRONG TO BE</p>
<p>DESTROYED IN THIS WAY. THE SOUTH</p>
<p>AMERICANS WERE THE FIRST TO REBEL</p>
<p>AGAINST THE REACTIONARY MEASURES</p>
<p>OF THE CONGRESS OF VIENNA, GREECE</p>
<p>AND BELGIUM AND SPAIN AND A LARGE</p>
<p>NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTRIES OF THE</p>
<p>EUROPEAN CONTINENT FOLLOWED SUIT</p>
<p>AND THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WAS</p>
<p>FILLED WITH THE RUMOUR OF MANY</p>
<p>WARS OF INDEPENDENCE</p>
<p>IT will serve no good purpose to say ``if only the Congress</p>
<p>of Vienna had done such and such a thing instead of taking</p>
<p>such and such a course, the history of Europe in the nineteenth</p>
<p>century would have been different.&#x27;&#x27; The Congress of Vienna</p>
<p>was a gathering of men who had just passed through a great</p>
<p>revolution and through twenty years of terrible and almost</p>
<p>continuous warfare. They came together for the purpose of</p>
<p>giving Europe that ``peace and stability&#x27;&#x27; which they thought</p>
<p>that the people needed and wanted. They were what we call</p>
<p>reactionaries. They sincerely believed in the inability of the</p>
<p>mass of the people to rule themselves. They re-arranged the</p>
<p>map of Europe in such a way as seemed to promise the greatest</p>
<p>possibility of a lasting success. They failed, but not through</p>
<p>any premeditated wickedness on their part. They were, for the</p>
<p>greater part, men of the old school who remembered the happier</p>
<p>days of their quiet youth and ardently wished a return of that</p>
<p>blessed period. They failed to recognise the strong hold which</p>
<p>many of the revolutionary principles had gained upon the people</p>
<p>of the European continent. That was a misfortune but</p>
<p>hardly a sin. But one of the things which the French Revolution</p>
<p>had taught not only Europe but America as well, was the</p>
<p>right of people to their own ``nationality.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Napoleon, who respected nothing and nobody, was utterly</p>
<p>ruthless in his dealing with national and patriotic aspirations.</p>
<p>But the early revolutionary generals had proclaimed the new</p>
<p>doctrine that ``nationality was not a matter of political</p>
<p>frontiers or round skulls and broad noses, but a matter of the</p>
<p>heart and soul.&#x27;&#x27; While they were teaching the French children</p>
<p>the greatness of the French nation, they encouraged Spaniards</p>
<p>and Hollanders and Italians to do the same thing. Soon</p>
<p>these people, who all shared Rousseau&#x27;s belief in the superior</p>
<p>virtues of Original Man, began to dig into their past and found,</p>
<p>buried beneath the ruins of the feudal system, the bones of the</p>
<p>mighty races of which they supposed themselves the feeble</p>
<p>descendants.</p>
<p>The first half of the nineteenth century was the era of the</p>
<p>great historical discoveries. Everywhere historians were busy</p>
<p>publishing mediaeval charters and early mediaeval chronicles</p>
<p>and in every country the result was a new pride in the old</p>
<p>fatherland. A great deal of this sentiment was based upon the</p>
<p>wrong interpretation of historical facts. But in practical politics,</p>
<p>it does not matter what is true, but everything depends</p>
<p>upon what the people believe to be true. And in most countries</p>
<p>both the kings and their subjects firmly believed in the glory</p>
<p>and fame of their ancestors.</p>
<p>The Congress of Vienna was not inclined to be sentimental.</p>
<p>Their Excellencies divided the map of Europe according to the</p>
<p>best interests of half a dozen dynasties and put ``national</p>
<p>aspirations&#x27;&#x27; upon the Index, or list of forbidden books, together</p>
<p>with all other dangerous ``French doctrines.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>But history is no respecter of Congresses. For some reason</p>
<p>or other (it may be an historical law, which thus far has</p>
<p>escaped the attention of the scholars) ``nations&#x27;&#x27; seemed to be</p>
<p>necessary for the orderly development of human society and</p>
<p>the attempt to stem this tide was quite as unsuccessful as the</p>
<p>Metternichian effort to prevent people from thinking.</p>
<p>Curiously enough the first trouble began in a very distant</p>
<p>part of the world, in South America. The Spanish colonies</p>
<p>of that continent had been enjoying a period of relative independence</p>
<p>during the many years of the great Napoleonic wars.</p>
<p>They had even remained faithful to their king when he was</p>
<p>taken prisoner by the French Emperor and they had refused</p>
<p>to recognise Joseph Bonaparte, who had in the year 1808 been</p>
<p>made King of Spain by order of his brother.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only part of America to get very much upset</p>
<p>by the Revolution was the island of Haiti, the Espagnola of</p>
<p>Columbus&#x27; first trip. Here in the year 1791 the French Convention,</p>
<p>in a sudden outburst of love and human brotherhood,</p>
<p>had bestowed upon their black brethren all the privileges hitherto</p>
<p>enjoyed by their white masters. Just as suddenly they had</p>
<p>repented of this step, but the attempt to undo the original</p>
<p>promise led to many years of terrible warfare between General</p>
<p>Leclerc, the brother-in-law of Napoleon, and Toussaint l&#x27;Ouverture,</p>
<p>the negro chieftain. In the year 1801, Toussaint was</p>
<p>asked to visit Leclerc and discuss terms of peace. He received</p>
<p>the solemn promise that he would not be molested. He trusted</p>
<p>his white adversaries, was put on board a ship and shortly</p>
<p>afterwards died in a French prison. But the negroes gained</p>
<p>their independence all the same and founded a Republic.</p>
<p>Incidentally they were of great help to the first great South</p>
<p>American patriot in his efforts to deliver his native country</p>
<p>from the Spanish yoke.</p>
<p>Simon Bolivar, a native of Caracas in Venezuela, born in</p>
<p>the year 1783, had been educated in Spain, had visited Paris</p>
<p>where he had seen the Revolutionary government at work, had</p>
<p>lived for a while in the United States and had returned to his</p>
<p>native land where the widespread discontent against Spain,</p>
<p>the mother country, was beginning to take a definite form.</p>
<p>In the year 1811, Venezuela declared its independence and</p>
<p>Bolivar became one of the revolutionary generals. Within</p>
<p>two months, the rebels were defeated and Bolivar fled.</p>
<p>For the next five years he was the leader of an apparently</p>
<p>lost cause. He sacrificed all his wealth and he would not have</p>
<p>been able to begin his final and successful expedition without</p>
<p>the support of the President of Haiti. Thereafter the revolt</p>
<p>spread all over South America and soon it appeared that Spain</p>
<p>was not able to suppress the rebellion unaided. She asked for</p>
<p>the support of the Holy Alliance.</p>
<p>This step greatly worried England. The British shippers</p>
<p>had succeeded the Dutch as the Common Carriers of the world</p>
<p>and they expected to reap heavy profits from a declaration of</p>
<p>independence on the part of all South America. They had</p>
<p>hopes that the United States o?America would interfere but</p>
<p>the Senate had no such plans and in the House, too, there were</p>
<p>many voices which declared that Spain ought to be given a</p>
<p>free hand.</p>
<p>Just then, there was a change of ministers in England.</p>
<p>The Whigs went out and the Tories came in. George Canning</p>
<p>became secretary of State. He dropped a hint that England</p>
<p>would gladly back up the American government with all the</p>
<p>might of her fleet, if said government would declare its</p>
<p>disapproval of the plans of the Holy Alliance in regard to the</p>
<p>rebellious colonies of the southern continent. President Monroe</p>
<p>thereupon, on the 2nd of December of the year 1823, addressed</p>
<p>Congress and stated that: ``America would consider</p>
<p>any attempt on the part of the allied powers to extend their</p>
<p>system to any portion of this western hemisphere as dangerous</p>
<p>to our peace and safety,&#x27;&#x27; and gave warning that ``the American</p>
<p>government would consider such action on the part of the</p>
<p>Holy Alliance as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition</p>
<p>toward the United States.&#x27;&#x27; Four weeks later, the text of the</p>
<p>``Monroe Doctrine&#x27;&#x27; was printed in the English newspapers and</p>
<p>the members of the Holy Alliance were forced to make their</p>
<p>choice.</p>
<p>Metternich hesitated. Personally he would have been willing</p>
<p>to risk the displeasure of the United States (which had</p>
<p>allowed both its army and navy to fall into neglect since the end</p>
<p>of the Anglo-American war of the year 1812.) But Canning&#x27;s</p>
<p>threatening attitude and trouble on the continent forced him</p>
<p>to be careful. The expedition never took place and South</p>
<p>America and Mexico gained their independence.</p>
<p>As for the troubles on the continent of Europe, they were</p>
<p>coming fast and furious. The Holy Alliance had sent French</p>
<p>troops to Spain to act as guardians of the peace in the year</p>
<ol start="1820">
<li>Austrian troops had been used for a similar purpose in</li>
</ol>
<p>Italy when the ``Carbonari&#x27;&#x27; (the secret society of the Charcoal</p>
<p>Burners) were making propaganda for a united Italy and had</p>
<p>caused a rebellion against the unspeakable Ferdinand of</p>
<p>Naples.</p>
<p>Bad news also came from Russia where the death of Alexander</p>
<p>had been the sign for a revolutionary outbreak in St.</p>
<p>Petersburg, a short but bloody upheaval, the so-called Dekaberist</p>
<p>revolt (because it took place in December,) which ended</p>
<p>with the hanging of a large number of good patriots who had</p>
<p>been disgusted by the reaction of Alexander&#x27;s last years and</p>
<p>had tried to give Russia a constitutional form of government.</p>
<p>But worse was to follow. Metternich had tried to assure</p>
<p>himself of the continued support of the European courts by a</p>
<p>series of conferences at Aix-la-Chapelle at Troppau at</p>
<p>Laibach and finally at Verona. The delegates from the</p>
<p>different powers duly travelled to these agreeable watering</p>
<p>places where the Austrian prime minister used to spend</p>
<p>his summers. They always promised to do their best</p>
<p>to suppress revolt but they were none too certain of their</p>
<p>success. The spirit of the people was beginning to be ugly and</p>
<p>especially in France the position of the king was by no means</p>
<p>satisfactory.</p>
<p>The real trouble however began in the Balkans, the gateway</p>
<p>to western Europe through which the invaders of that</p>
<p>continent had passed since the beginning of time. The first</p>
<p>outbreak was in Moldavia, the ancient Roman province of</p>
<p>Dacia which had been cut off from the Empire in the third</p>
<p>century. Since then, it had been a lost land, a sort of Atlantis,</p>
<p>where the people had continued to speak the old Roman tongue</p>
<p>and still called themselves Romans and their country Roumania.</p>
<p>Here in the year 1821, a young Greek, Prince Alexander</p>
<p>Ypsilanti, began a revolt against the Turks. He told his followers</p>
<p>that they could count upon the support of Russia. But</p>
<p>Metternich&#x27;s fast couriers were soon on their way to St Petersburg</p>
<p>and the Tsar, entirely persuaded by the Austrian arguments</p>
<p>in favor of ``peace and stability,&#x27;&#x27; refused to help. Ypsilanti</p>
<p>was forced to flee to Austria where he spent the next seven</p>
<p>years in prison.</p>
<p>In the same year, 1821, trouble began in Greece. Since</p>
<p>1815 a secret society of Greek patriots had been preparing</p>
<p>the way for a revolt. Suddenly they hoisted the flag of</p>
<p>independence in the Morea (the ancient Peloponnesus) and drove</p>
<p>the Turkish garrisons away. The Turks answered in the usual</p>
<p>fashion. They took the Greek Patriarch of Constantinople,</p>
<p>who was regarded as their Pope both by the Greeks and by</p>
<p>many Russians, and they hanged him on Easter Sunday of the</p>
<p>year 1821, together with a number of his bishops. The Greeks</p>
<p>came back with a massacre of all the Mohammedans in</p>
<p>Tripolitsa, the capital of the Morea and the Turks retaliated</p>
<p>by an attack upon the island of Chios, where they murdered</p>
<p>25,000 Christians and sold 45,000 others as slaves into Asia and</p>
<p>Egypt.</p>
<p>Then the Greeks appealed to the European courts, but</p>
<p>Metternich told them in so many words that they could ``stew</p>
<p>in their own grease,&#x27;&#x27; (I am not trying to make a pun, but I</p>
<p>am quoting His Serene Highness who informed the Tsar that</p>
<p>this ``fire of revolt ought to burn itself out beyond the pale</p>
<p>of civilisation) and the frontiers were closed to those volunteers</p>
<p>who wished to go to the rescue of the patriotic Hellenes.</p>
<p>Their cause seemed lost. At the request of Turkey, an Egyptian</p>
<p>army was landed in the Morea and soon the Turkish flag</p>
<p>was again flying from the Acropolis, the ancient stronghold of</p>
<p>Athens. The Egyptian army then pacified the country ``a la</p>
<p>Turque,&#x27;&#x27; and Metternich followed the proceedings with quiet</p>
<p>interest, awaiting the day when this ``attempt against the peace</p>
<p>of Europe&#x27;&#x27; should be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Once more it was England which upset his plans. The</p>
<p>greatest glory of England does not lie in her vast colonial</p>
<p>possessions, in her wealth or her navy, but in the quiet heroism</p>
<p>and independence of her average citizen. The Englishman</p>
<p>obeys the law because he knows that respect for the rights of</p>
<p>others marks the difference between a dog-kennel and civilised</p>
<p>society. But he does not recognize the right of others to interfere</p>
<p>with his freedom of thought. If his country does something</p>
<p>which he believes to be wrong, he gets up and says so</p>
<p>and the government which he attacks will respect him and will</p>
<p>give him full protection against the mob which to-day, as in</p>
<p>the time of Socrates, often loves to destroy those who surpass</p>
<p>it in courage or intelligence. There never has been a good</p>
<p>cause, however unpopular or however distant, which has not</p>
<p>counted a number of Englishmen among its staunchest adherents.</p>
<p>The mass of the English people are not different from</p>
<p>those in other lands. They stick to the business at hand and</p>
<p>have no time for unpractical ``sporting ventures.&#x27;&#x27; But they</p>
<p>rather admire their eccentric neighbour who drops everything</p>
<p>to go and fight for some obscure people in Asia or Africa and</p>
<p>when he has been killed they give him a fine public funeral and</p>
<p>hold him up to their children as an example of valor and chivalry.</p>
<p>Even the police spies of the Holy Alliance were powerless</p>
<p>against this national characteristic. In the year 1824, Lord</p>
<p>Byron, a rich young Englishman who wrote the poetry over</p>
<p>which all Europe wept, hoisted the sails of his yacht and started</p>
<p>south to help the Greeks. Three months later the news spread</p>
<p>through Europe that their hero lay dead in Missolonghi,</p>
<p>the last of the Greek strongholds. His lonely death</p>
<p>caught the imagination of the people. In all countries, societies</p>
<p>were formed to help the Greeks. Lafayette, the grand old</p>
<p>man of the American revolution, pleaded their cause in France.</p>
<p>The king of Bavaria sent hundreds of his officers. Money and</p>
<p>supplies poured in upon the starving men of Missolonghi.</p>
<p>In England, George Canning, who had defeated the plans</p>
<p>of the Holy Alliance in South America, was now prime minis-</p>
<p>ter. He saw his chance to checkmate Metternich for a second</p>
<p>time. The English and Russian fleets were already in the</p>
<p>Mediterranean. They were sent by governments which dared</p>
<p>no longer suppress the popular enthusiasm for the cause of the</p>
<p>Greek patriots. The French navy appeared because France,</p>
<p>since the end of the Crusades, had assumed the role of the</p>
<p>defender of the Christian faith in Mohammedan lands. On October</p>
<p>20 of the year 1827, the ships of the three nations attacked</p>
<p>the Turkish fleet in the bay of Navarino and destroyed it.</p>
<p>Rarely has the news of a battle been received with such general</p>
<p>rejoicing. The people of western Europe and Russia who</p>
<p>enjoyed no freedom at home consoled themselves by fighting</p>
<p>an imaginary war of liberty on behalf of the oppressed Greeks.</p>
<p>In the year 1829 they had their reward. Greece became an</p>
<p>independent nation and the policy of reaction and stability</p>
<p>suffered its second great defeat.</p>
<p>It would be absurd were I to try, in this short volume, to</p>
<p>give you a detailed account of the struggle for national</p>
<p>independence in all other countries. There are a large number of</p>
<p>excellent books devoted to such subjects. I have described the</p>
<p>struggle for the independence of Greece because it was the first</p>
<p>successful attack upon the bulwark of reaction which the Congress</p>
<p>of Vienna had erected to ``maintain the stability of Europe.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>That mighty fortress of suppression still held out and</p>
<p>Metternich continued to be in command. But the end was</p>
<p>near.</p>
<p>In France the Bourbons had established an almost unbearable</p>
<p>rule of police officials who were trying to undo the work</p>
<p>of the French revolution, with an absolute disregard of the</p>
<p>regulations and laws of civilised warfare. When Louis</p>
<p>XVIII died in the year 1824, the people had enjoyed nine</p>
<p>years of ``peace&#x27;&#x27; which had proved even more unhappy than</p>
<p>the ten years of war of the Empire. Louis was succeeded by</p>
<p>his brother, Charles X.</p>
<p>Louis had belonged to that famous Bourbon family which,</p>
<p>although it never learned anything, never forgot anything.</p>
<p>The recollection of that morning in the town of Hamm, when</p>
<p>news had reached him of the decapitation of his brother,</p>
<p>remained a constant warning of what might happen to those</p>
<p>kings who did not read the signs of the times aright. Charles,</p>
<p>on the other hand, who had managed to run up private debts of</p>
<p>fifty million francs before he was twenty years of age, knew</p>
<p>nothing, remembered nothing and firmly intended to learn</p>
<p>nothing. As soon as he had succeeded his brother, he established</p>
<p>a government ``by priests, through priests and for</p>
<p>priests,&#x27;&#x27; and while the Duke of Wellington, who made this remark,</p>
<p>cannot be called a violent liberal, Charles ruled in such</p>
<p>a way that he disgusted even that trusted friend of law and</p>
<p>order. When he tried to suppress the newspapers which dared</p>
<p>to criticise his government, and dismissed the Parliament because</p>
<p>it supported the Press, his days were numbered.</p>
<p>On the night of the 27th of July of the year 1830, a revolution</p>
<p>took place in Paris. On the 30th of the same month, the</p>
<p>king fled to the coast and set sail for England. In this way</p>
<p>the ``famous farce of fifteen years&#x27;&#x27; came to an end and the</p>
<p>Bourbons were at last removed from the throne of France.</p>
<p>They were too hopelessly incompetent. France then might</p>
<p>have returned to a Republican form of government, but such</p>
<p>a step would not have been tolerated by Metternich.</p>
<p>The situation was dangerous enough. The spark of rebellion</p>
<p>had leaped beyond the French frontier and had set fire to</p>
<p>another powder house filled with national grievances. The new</p>
<p>kingdom of the Netherlands had not been a success. The Belgian</p>
<p>and the Dutch people had nothing in common and their</p>
<p>king, William of Orange (the descendant of an uncle of William</p>
<p>the Silent), while a hard worker and a good business man,</p>
<p>was too much lacking in tact and pliability to keep the peace</p>
<p>among his uncongenial subjects. Besides, the horde of priests</p>
<p>which had descended upon France, had at once found its way</p>
<p>into Belgium and whatever Protestant William tried to do was</p>
<p>howled down by large crowds of excited citizens as a fresh attempt</p>
<p>upon the ``freedom of the Catholic church.&#x27;&#x27; On the 25th</p>
<p>of August there was a popular outbreak against the Dutch</p>
<p>authorities in Brussels. Two months later, the Belgians</p>
<p>declared themselves independent and elected Leopold of Coburg,</p>
<p>the uncle of Queen Victoria of England, to the throne.</p>
<p>That was an excellent solution of the difficulty. The two</p>
<p>countries, which never ought to have been united, parted their</p>
<p>ways and thereafter lived in peace and harmony and behaved</p>
<p>like decent neighbours.</p>
<p>News in those days when there were only a few short railroads,</p>
<p>travelled slowly, but when the success of the French</p>
<p>and the Belgian revolutionists became known in Poland there</p>
<p>was an immediate clash between the Poles and their Russian</p>
<p>rulers which led to a year of terrible warfare and ended with a</p>
<p>complete victory for the Russians who ``established order along</p>
<p>the banks of the Vistula&#x27;&#x27; in the well-known Russian fashion</p>
<p>Nicholas the first, who had succeeded his brother Alexander in</p>
<p>1825, firmly believed in the Divine Right of his own family,</p>
<p>and the thousands of Polish refugees who had found shelter</p>
<p>in western Europe bore witness to the fact that the principles</p>
<p>of the Holy Alliance were still more than a hollow phrase in</p>
<p>Holy Russia.</p>
<p>In Italy too there was a moment of unrest. Marie Louise</p>
<p>Duchess of Parma and wife of the former Emperor Napoleon,</p>
<p>whom she had deserted after the defeat of Waterloo, was</p>
<p>driven away from her country, and in the Papal state the</p>
<p>exasperated people tried to establish an independent Republic.</p>
<p>But the armies of Austria marched to Rome and soon every</p>
<p>thing was as of old. Metternich continued to reside at the Ball</p>
<p>Platz, the home of the foreign minister of the Habsburg</p>
<p>dynasty, the police spies returned to their job, and peace</p>
<p>reigned supreme. Eighteen more years were to pass before a</p>
<p>second and more successful attempt could be made to deliver</p>
<p>Europe from the terrible inheritance of the Vienna Congress.</p>
<p>Again it was France, the revolutionary weather-cock of</p>
<p>Europe, which gave the signal of revolt. Charles X had been</p>
<p>succeeded by Louis Philippe, the son of that famous Duke of</p>
<p>Orleans who had turned Jacobin, had voted for the death of his</p>
<p>cousin the king, and had played a role during the early days</p>
<p>of the revolution under the name of ``Philippe Egalite&#x27;&#x27; or</p>
<p>``Equality Philip.&#x27;&#x27; Eventually he had been killed when</p>
<p>Robespierre tried to purge the nation of all ``traitors,&#x27;&#x27; (by</p>
<p>which name he indicated those people who did not share his own</p>
<p>views) and his son had been forced to run away from the</p>
<p>revolutionary army. Young Louis Philippe thereupon had</p>
<p>wandered far and wide. He had taught school in Switzerland</p>
<p>and had spent a couple of years exploring the unknown ``far</p>
<p>west&#x27;&#x27; of America. After the fall of Napoleon he had returned</p>
<p>to Paris. He was much more intelligent than his Bourbon</p>
<p>cousins. He was a simple man who went about in the public</p>
<p>parks with a red cotton umbrella under his arm, followed by a</p>
<p>brood of children like any good housefather. But France had</p>
<p>outgrown the king business and Louis did not know this until</p>
<p>the morning of the 24th of February, of the year 1848, when</p>
<p>a crowd stormed the Tuilleries and drove his Majesty away and</p>
<p>proclaimed the Republic.</p>
<p>When the news of this event reached Vienna, Metternich</p>
<p>expressed the casual opinion that this was only a repetition</p>
<p>of the year 1793 and that the Allies would once more be obliged</p>
<p>to march upon Paris and make an end to this very unseemly</p>
<p>democratic row. But two weeks later his own Austrian capital</p>
<p>was in open revolt. Metternich escaped from the mob through</p>
<p>the back door of his palace, and the Emperor Ferdinand was</p>
<p>forced to give his subjects a constitution which embodied most</p>
<p>of the revolutionary principles which his Prime Minister had</p>
<p>tried to suppress for the last thirty-three years.</p>
<p>This time all Europe felt the shock. Hungary declared itself</p>
<p>independent, and commenced a war against the Habsburgs</p>
<p>under the leadership of Louis Kossuth. The unequal</p>
<p>struggle lasted more than a year. It was finally suppressed by</p>
<p>the armies of Tsar Nicholas who marched across the Carpathian</p>
<p>mountains and made Hungary once more safe for autocracy.</p>
<p>The Habsburgs thereupon established extraordinary</p>
<p>court-martials and hanged the greater part of the Hungarian</p>
<p>patriots whom they had not been able to defeat in open battle.</p>
<p>As for Italy, the island of Sicily declared itself independent</p>
<p>from Naples and drove its Bourbon king away. In the Papal</p>
<p>states the prime minister, Rossi, was murdered and the Pope</p>
<p>was forced to flee. He returned the next year at the head of a</p>
<p>French army which remained in Rome to protect His Holiness</p>
<p>against his subjects until the year 1870. Then it was</p>
<p>called back to defend France against the Prussians, and</p>
<p>Rome became the capital of Italy. In the north, Milan and</p>
<p>Venice rose against their Austrian masters. They were supported</p>
<p>by king Albert of Sardinia, but a strong Austrian army</p>
<p>under old Radetzky marched into the valley of the Po, defeated</p>
<p>the Sardinians near Custozza and Novara and forced</p>
<p>Albert to abdicate in favour of his son, Victor Emanuel, who</p>
<p>a few years later was to be the first king of a united Italy.</p>
<p>In Germany the unrest of the year 1848 took the form of a</p>
<p>great national demonstration in favour of political unity and a</p>
<p>representative form of government. In Bavaria, the king who</p>
<p>had wasted his time and money upon an Irish lady who posed as</p>
<p>a Spanish dancer--(she was called Lola Montez and lies buried</p>
<p>in New York&#x27;s Potter&#x27;s Field)--was driven away by the enraged</p>
<p>students of the university. In Prussia, the king was</p>
<p>forced to stand with uncovered head before the coffins of those</p>
<p>who had been killed during the street fighting and to promise a</p>
<p>constitutional form of government. And in March of the year</p>
<p>1849, a German parliament, consisting of 550 delegates from</p>
<p>all parts of the country came together in Frankfort and proposed</p>
<p>that king Frederick William of Prussia should be the</p>
<p>Emperor of a United Germany.</p>
<p>Then, however, the tide began to turn. Incompetent Ferdinand</p>
<p>had abdicated in favour of his nephew Francis Joseph.</p>
<p>The well-drilled Austrian army had remained faithful to their</p>
<p>war-lord. The hangman was given plenty of work and the</p>
<p>Habsburgs, after the nature of that strangely cat-like family,</p>
<p>once more landed upon their feet and rapidly strengthened</p>
<p>their position as the masters of eastern and western Europe.</p>
<p>They played the game of politics very adroitly and used the</p>
<p>jealousies of the other German states to prevent the elevation</p>
<p>of the Prussian king to the Imperial dignity. Their long train-</p>
<p>ing in the art of suffering defeat had taught them the value of</p>
<p>patience. They knew how to wait. They bided their time</p>
<p>and while the liberals, utterly untrained in practical politics,</p>
<p>talked and talked and talked and got intoxicated by their own</p>
<p>fine speeches, the Austrians quietly gathered their forces, dismissed</p>
<p>the Parliament of Frankfort and re-established the old</p>
<p>and impossible German confederation which the Congress of</p>
<p>Vienna had wished upon an unsuspecting world.</p>
<p>But among the men who had attended this strange Parliament</p>
<p>of unpractical enthusiasts, there was a Prussian country</p>
<p>squire by the name of Bismarck, who had made good use of his</p>
<p>eyes and ears. He had a deep contempt for oratory. He knew</p>
<p>(what every man of action has always known) that nothing</p>
<p>is ever accomplished by talk. In his own way he was a sincere</p>
<p>patriot. He had been trained in the old school of diplomacy</p>
<p>and he could outlie his opponents just as he could outwalk</p>
<p>them and outdrink them and outride them.</p>
<p>Bismarck felt convinced that the loose confederation</p>
<p>of little states must be changed into a strong united country</p>
<p>if it would hold its own against the other European powers.</p>
<p>Brought up amidst feudal ideas of loyalty, he decided that</p>
<p>the house of Hohenzollern, of which he was the most faithful</p>
<p>servant, should rule the new state, rather than the incompetent</p>
<p>Habsburgs. For this purpose he must first get rid of the</p>
<p>Austrian influence, and he began to make the necessary</p>
<p>preparations for this painful operation.</p>
<p>Italy in the meantime had solved her own problem, and had</p>
<p>rid herself of her hated Austrian master. The unity of Italy</p>
<p>was the work of three men, Cavour, Mazzini and Garibaldi.</p>
<p>Of these three, Cavour, the civil-engineer with the short-sighted</p>
<p>eyes and the steel-rimmed glasses, played the part of the careful</p>
<p>political pilot. Mazzini, who had spent most of his days</p>
<p>in different European garrets, hiding from the Austrian police,</p>
<p>was the public agitator, while Garibaldi, with his band of red-</p>
<p>shirted rough-riders, appealed to the popular imagination.</p>
<p>Mazzini and Garibaldi were both believers in the Republican</p>
<p>form of government. Cavour, however, was a monarch-</p>
<p>ist, and the others who recognised his superior ability in such</p>
<p>matters of practical statecraft, accepted his decision and sacrificed</p>
<p>their own ambitions for the greater good of their beloved</p>
<p>Fatherland.</p>
<p>Cavour felt towards the House of Sardinia as Bismarck</p>
<p>did towards the Hohenzollern family. With infinite care and</p>
<p>great shrewdness he set to work to jockey the Sardinian King</p>
<p>into a position from which His Majesty would be able to assume</p>
<p>the leadership of the entire Italian people. The unsettled</p>
<p>political conditions in the rest of Europe greatly helped him in</p>
<p>his plans and no country contributed more to the independence</p>
<p>of Italy than her old and trusted (and often distrusted)</p>
<p>neighbour, France.</p>
<p>In that turbulent country, in November of the year 1852,</p>
<p>the Republic had come to a sudden but not unexpected end.</p>
<p>Napoleon III the son of Louis Bonaparte the former King of</p>
<p>Holland, and the small nephew of a great uncle, had re-</p>
<p>established an Empire and had made himself Emperor ``by the</p>
<p>Grace of God and the Will of the People.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>This young man, who had been educated in Germany and</p>
<p>who mixed his French with harsh Teutonic gutturals (just</p>
<p>as the first Napoleon had always spoken the language of his</p>
<p>adopted country with a strong Italian accent) was trying very</p>
<p>hard to use the Napoleonic tradition for his own benefit. But</p>
<p>he had many enemies and did not feel very certain of his hold</p>
<p>upon his ready-made throne. He had gained the friendship</p>
<p>of Queen Victoria but this had not been a difficult task, as the</p>
<p>good Queen was not particularly brilliant and was very susceptible</p>
<p>to flattery. As for the other European sovereigns,</p>
<p>they treated the French Emperor with insulting haughtiness</p>
<p>and sat up nights devising new ways in which they could show</p>
<p>their upstart ``Good Brother&#x27;&#x27; how sincerely they despised him.</p>
<p>Napoleon was obliged to find a way in which he could break</p>
<p>this opposition, either through love or through fear. He well</p>
<p>knew the fascination which the word ``glory&#x27;&#x27; still held for his</p>
<p>subjects. Since he was forced to gamble for his throne he</p>
<p>decided to play the game of Empire for high stakes. He used</p>
<p>an attack of Russia upon Turkey as an excuse for bringing</p>
<p>about the Crimean war in which England and France combined</p>
<p>against the Tsar on behalf of the Sultan. It was a very</p>
<p>costly and exceedingly unprofitable enterprise. Neither</p>
<p>France nor England nor Russia reaped much glory.</p>
<p>But the Crimean war did one good thing. It gave Sardinia</p>
<p>a chance to volunteer on the winning side and when peace was</p>
<p>declared it gave Cavour the opportunity to lay claim to the</p>
<p>gratitude of both England and France.</p>
<p>Having made use of the international situation to get Sardinia</p>
<p>recognised as one of the more important powers of Europe,</p>
<p>the clever Italian then provoked a war between Sardinia</p>
<p>and Austria in June of the year 1859. He assured himself of</p>
<p>the support of Napoleon in exchange for the provinces of</p>
<p>Savoy and the city of Nice, which was really an Italian town.</p>
<p>The Franco-Italian armies defeated the Austrians at Magenta</p>
<p>and Solferino, and the former Austrian provinces and duchies</p>
<p>were united into a single Italian kingdom. Florence became</p>
<p>the capital of this new Italy until the year 1870 when the</p>
<p>French recalled their troops from Home to defend France</p>
<p>against the Germans. As soon as they were gone, the Italian</p>
<p>troops entered the eternal city and the House of Sardinia took</p>
<p>up its residence in the old Palace of the Quirinal which an</p>
<p>ancient Pope had built on the ruins of the baths of the Emperor</p>
<p>Constantine.</p>
<p>The Pope, however, moved across the river Tiber and hid</p>
<p>behind the walls of the Vatican, which had been the home of</p>
<p>many of his predecessors since their return from the exile of</p>
<p>Avignon in the year 1377. He protested loudly against this</p>
<p>high-handed theft of his domains and addressed letters of appeal</p>
<p>to those faithful Catholics who were inclined to sympathise</p>
<p>with him in his loss. Their number, however, was small,</p>
<p>and it has been steadily decreasing. For, once delivered from</p>
<p>the cares of state, the Pope was able to devote all his time to</p>
<p>questions of a spiritual nature. Standing high above the petty</p>
<p>quarrels of the European politicians, the Papacy assumed a new</p>
<p>dignity which proved of great benefit to the church and made</p>
<p>it an international power for social and religious progress</p>
<p>which has shown a much more intelligent appreciation of modern</p>
<p>economic problems than most Protestant sects.</p>
<p>In this way, the attempt of the Congress of Vienna to</p>
<p>settle the Italian question by making the peninsula an</p>
<p>Austrian province was at last undone.</p>
<p>The German problem however remained as yet unsolved.</p>
<p>It proved the most difficult of all. The failure of the revolution</p>
<p>of the year 1848 had led to the wholesale migration of the more</p>
<p>energetic and liberal elements among the German people.</p>
<p>These young fellows had moved to the United States of America,</p>
<p>to Brazil, to the new colonies in Asia and America. Their</p>
<p>work was continued in Germany but by a different sort of men.</p>
<p>In the new Diet which met at Frankfort, after the collapse</p>
<p>of the German Parliament and the failure of the Liberals to</p>
<p>establish a united country, the Kingdom of Prussia was represented</p>
<p>by that same Otto von Bismarck from whom we parted</p>
<p>a few pages ago. Bismarck by now had managed to gain the</p>
<p>complete confidence of the king of Prussia. That was all he</p>
<p>asked for. The opinion of the Prussian parliament or of the</p>
<p>Prussian people interested him not at all. With his own eyes</p>
<p>he had seen the defeat of the Liberals. He knew that he</p>
<p>would not be able to get rid of Austria without a war and he</p>
<p>began by strengthening the Prussian army. The Landtag, exasperated</p>
<p>at his high-handed methods, refused to give him the</p>
<p>necessary credits. Bismarck did not even bother to discuss</p>
<p>the matter. He went ahead and increased his army with the</p>
<p>help of funds which the Prussian house of Peers and the king</p>
<p>placed at his disposal. Then he looked for a national cause</p>
<p>which could be used for the purpose of creating a great wave</p>
<p>of patriotism among all the German people.</p>
<p>In the north of Germany there were the Duchies of Schleswig</p>
<p>and Holstein which ever since the middle ages had been a</p>
<p>source of trouble. Both countries were inhabited by a certain</p>
<p>number of Danes and a certain number of Germans, but although</p>
<p>they were governed by the King of Denmark, they</p>
<p>were not an integral part of the Danish State and this led to</p>
<p>endless difficulties. Heaven forbid that I should revive this</p>
<p>forgotten question which now seems settled by the acts of the</p>
<p>recent Congress of Versailles. But the Germans in Holstein</p>
<p>were very loud in their abuse of the Danes and the Danes in</p>
<p>Schleswig made a great ado of their Danishness, and all Europe</p>
<p>was discussing the problem and German Mannerchors</p>
<p>and Turnvereins listened to sentimental speeches about the</p>
<p>``lost brethren&#x27;&#x27; and the different chancelleries were trying to</p>
<p>discover what it was all about, when Prussia mobilised her</p>
<p>armies to ``save the lost provinces.&#x27;&#x27; As Austria, the official</p>
<p>head of the German Confederation, could not allow Prussia</p>
<p>to act alone in such an important matter, the Habsburg troops</p>
<p>were mobilised too and the combined armies of the two great</p>
<p>powers crossed the Danish frontiers and after a very brave</p>
<p>resistance on the part of the Danes, occupied the two duchies.</p>
<p>The Danes appealed to Europe, but Europe was otherwise</p>
<p>engaged and the poor Danes were left to their fate.</p>
<p>Bismarck then prepared the scene for the second number</p>
<p>upon his Imperial programme. He used the division of the</p>
<p>spoils to pick a quarrel with Austria. The Habsburgs fell into</p>
<p>the trap. The new Prussian army, the creation of Bismarck and</p>
<p>his faithful generals, invaded Bohemia and in less than six</p>
<p>weeks, the last of the Austrian troops had been destroyed at</p>
<p>Koniggratz and Sadowa and the road to Vienna lay open. But</p>
<p>Bismarck did not want to go too far. He knew that he would</p>
<p>need a few friends in Europe. He offered the defeated</p>
<p>Habsburgs very decent terms of peace, provided they would</p>
<p>resign their chairmanship of the Confederation. He was less</p>
<p>merciful to many of the smaller German states who had taken</p>
<p>the side of the Austrians, and annexed them to Prussia. The</p>
<p>greater part of the northern states then formed a new organisation,</p>
<p>the so-called North German Confederacy, and victorious</p>
<p>Prussia assumed the unofficial leadership of the German</p>
<p>people.</p>
<p>Europe stood aghast at the rapidity with which the work of</p>
<p>consolidation had been done. England was quite indifferent</p>
<p>but France showed signs of disapproval. Napoleon&#x27;s hold</p>
<p>upon the French people was steadily diminishing. The Crimean</p>
<p>war had been costly and had accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>A second adventure in the year 1863, when a French army</p>
<p>had tried to force an Austrian Grand-Duke by the name of</p>
<p>Maximilian upon the Mexican people as their Emperor, had</p>
<p>come to a disastrous end as soon as the American Civil War had</p>
<p>been won by the North. For the Government at Washington</p>
<p>had forced the French to withdraw their troops and this had</p>
<p>given the Mexicans a chance to clear their country of the enemy</p>
<p>and shoot the unwelcome Emperor.</p>
<p>It was necessary to give the Napoleonic throne a new</p>
<p>coat of glory-paint. Within a few years the North German</p>
<p>Confederation would be a serious rival of France. Napoleon</p>
<p>decided that a war with Germany would be a good thing for his</p>
<p>dynasty. He looked for an excuse and Spain, the poor victim</p>
<p>of endless revolutions, gave him one.</p>
<p>Just then the Spanish throne happened to be vacant. It</p>
<p>had been offered to the Catholic branch of the house of Hohenzollern.</p>
<p>The French government had objected and the Hohenzollerns</p>
<p>had politely refused to accept the crown. But</p>
<p>Napoleon, who was showing signs of illness, was very much</p>
<p>under the influence of his beautiful wife, Eugenie de Montijo,</p>
<p>the daughter of a Spanish gentleman and the grand-daughter</p>
<p>of William Kirkpatrick, an American consul at Malaga, where</p>
<p>the grapes come from. Eugenie, although shrewd enough, was</p>
<p>as badly educated as most Spanish women of that day. She</p>
<p>was at the mercy of her spiritual advisers and these worthy</p>
<p>gentlemen felt no love for the Protestant King of Prussia. ``Be</p>
<p>bold,&#x27;&#x27; was the advice of the Empress to her husband, but she</p>
<p>omitted to add the second half of that famous Persian proverb</p>
<p>which admonishes the hero to ``be bold but not too bold.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Napoleon, convinced of the strength of his army, addressed</p>
<p>himself to the king of Prussia and insisted that the king give</p>
<p>him assurances that ``he would never permit another candidature</p>
<p>of a Hohenzollern prince to the Spanish crown.&#x27;&#x27; As</p>
<p>the Hohenzollerns had just declined the honour, the demand</p>
<p>was superfluous, and Bismarck so informed the French government.</p>
<p>But Napoleon was not satisfied.</p>
<p>It was the year 1870 and King William was taking the</p>
<p>waters at Ems. There one day he was approached by the</p>
<p>French minister who tried to re-open the discussion. The king</p>
<p>answered very pleasantly that it was a fine day and that the</p>
<p>Spanish question was now closed and that nothing more</p>
<p>remained to be said upon the subject. As a matter of</p>
<p>routine, a report of this interview was telegraphed to</p>
<p>Bismarck, who handled all foreign affairs. Bismarck edited</p>
<p>the dispatch for the benefit of the Prussian and French</p>
<p>press. Many people have called him names for doing</p>
<p>this. Bismarck however could plead the excuse that the doctoring</p>
<p>of official news, since time immemorial, had been one</p>
<p>of the privileges of all civilised governments. When the ``edited&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>telegram was printed, the good people in Berlin felt that</p>
<p>their old and venerable king with his nice white whiskers had</p>
<p>been insulted by an arrogant little Frenchman and the equally</p>
<p>good people of Paris flew into a rage because their perfectly</p>
<p>courteous minister had been shown the door by a Royal Prussian</p>
<p>flunkey.</p>
<p>And so they both went to war and in less than two months,</p>
<p>Napoleon and the greater part of his army were prisoners of</p>
<p>the Germans. The Second Empire had come to an end and the</p>
<p>Third Republic was making ready to defend Paris against the</p>
<p>German invaders. Paris held out for five long months. Ten</p>
<p>days before the surrender of the city, in the nearby palace of</p>
<p>Versailles, built by that same King Louis XIV who had been</p>
<p>such a dangerous enemy to the Germans, the King of Prussia</p>
<p>was publicly proclaimed German Emperor and a loud booming</p>
<p>of guns told the hungry Parisians that a new German Empire</p>
<p>had taken the place of the old harmless Confederation of Teutonic</p>
<p>states and stateless.</p>
<p>In this rough way, the German question was finally settled.</p>
<p>By the end of the year 1871, fifty-six years after the memorable</p>
<p>gathering at Vienna, the work of the Congress had been entirely</p>
<p>undone. Metternich and Alexander and Talleyrand had tried</p>
<p>to give the people of Europe a lasting peace. The methods</p>
<p>they had employed had caused endless wars and revolutions and</p>
<p>the feeling of a common brotherhood of the eighteenth century</p>
<p>was followed by an era of exaggerated nationalism which has</p>
<p>not yet come to an end.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF THE ENGINE</p>
<p>BUT WHILE THE PEOPLE OF EUROPE WERE</p>
<p>FIGHTING FOR THEIR NATIONAL</p>
<p>INDEPENDENCE, THE WORLD IN WHICH THEY</p>
<p>LIVED HAD BEEN ENTIRELY CHANGED</p>
<p>BY A SERIES OF INVENTIONS, WHICH HAD</p>
<p>MADE THE CLUMSY OLD STEAM ENGINE</p>
<p>OF THE 18TH CENTURY THE MOST FAITHFUL</p>
<p>AND EFFICIENT SLAVE OF MAN</p>
<p>THE greatest benefactor of the human race died more than</p>
<p>half a million years ago. He was a hairy creature with a low</p>
<p>brow and sunken eyes, a heavy jaw and strong tiger-like teeth.</p>
<p>He would not have looked well in a gathering of modern scientists,</p>
<p>but they would have honoured him as their master. For</p>
<p>he had used a stone to break a nut and a stick to lift up a heavy</p>
<p>boulder. He was the inventor of the hammer and the lever, our</p>
<p>first tools, and he did more than any human being who came</p>
<p>after him to give man his enormous advantage over the other</p>
<p>animals with whom he shares this planet.</p>
<p>Ever since, man has tried to make his life easier by the use</p>
<p>of a greater number of tools. The first wheel (a round disc</p>
<p>made out of an old tree) created as much stir in the communities</p>
<p>of 100,000 B.C. as the flying machine did only a few years</p>
<p>ago.</p>
<p>In Washington, the story is told of a director of the Patent</p>
<p>Office who in the early thirties of the last century suggested</p>
<p>that the Patent Office be abolished, because ``everything that</p>
<p>possibly could be invented had been invented.&#x27;&#x27; A similar</p>
<p>feeling must have spread through the prehistoric world when</p>
<p>the first sail was hoisted on a raft and the people were able</p>
<p>to move from place to place without rowing or punting or</p>
<p>pulling from the shore.</p>
<p>Indeed one of the most interesting chapters of history is</p>
<p>the effort of man to let some one else or something else do his</p>
<p>work for him, while he enjoyed his leisure, sitting in the sun</p>
<p>or painting pictures on rocks, or training young wolves and</p>
<p>little tigers to behave like peaceful domestic animals.</p>
<p>Of course in the very olden days; it was always possible</p>
<p>to enslave a weaker neighbour and force him to do the unpleasant</p>
<p>tasks of life. One of the reasons why the Greeks and</p>
<p>Romans, who were quite as intelligent as we are, failed to</p>
<p>devise more interesting machinery, was to be found in the wide-</p>
<p>spread existence of slavery. Why should a great mathematician</p>
<p>waste his time upon wires and pulleys and cogs and fill</p>
<p>the air with noise and smoke when he could go to the marketplace</p>
<p>and buy all the slaves he needed at a very small expense?</p>
<p>And during the middle-ages, although slavery had been</p>
<p>abolished and only a mild form of serfdom survived, the guilds</p>
<p>discouraged the idea of using machinery because they thought</p>
<p>this would throw a large number of their brethren out of</p>
<p>work. Besides, the Middle-Ages were not at all interested</p>
<p>in producing large quantities of goods. Their tailors and butchers</p>
<p>and carpenters worked for the immediate needs of the small</p>
<p>community in which they lived and had no desire to compete</p>
<p>with their neighbours, or to produce more than was strictly</p>
<p>necessary.</p>
<p>During the Renaissance, when the prejudices of the Church</p>
<p>against scientific investigations could no longer be enforced as</p>
<p>rigidly as before, a large number of men began to devote their</p>
<p>lives to mathematics and astronomy and physics and chemistry.</p>
<p>Two years before the beginning of the Thirty Years War,</p>
<p>John Napier, a Scotchman, had published his little book which</p>
<p>described the new invention of logarithms. During the war it-</p>
<p>self, Gottfried Leibnitz of Leipzig had perfected the system of</p>
<p>infinitesimal calculus. Eight years before the peace of Westphalia,</p>
<p>Newton, the great English natural philosopher, was</p>
<p>born, and in that same year Galileo, the Italian astronomer,</p>
<p>died. Meanwhile the Thirty Years War had destroyed the prosperity</p>
<p>of central Europe and there was a sudden but very general</p>
<p>interest in ``alchemy,&#x27;&#x27; the strange pseudo-science of the</p>
<p>middle-ages by which people hoped to turn base metals into</p>
<p>gold. This proved to be impossible but the alchemists in their</p>
<p>laboratories stumbled upon many new ideas and greatly helped</p>
<p>the work of the chemists who were their successors.</p>
<p>The work of all these men provided the world with a solid</p>
<p>scientific foundation upon which it was possible to build even</p>
<p>the most complicated of engines, and a number of practical</p>
<p>men made good use of it. The Middle-Ages had used wood for</p>
<p>the few bits of necessary machinery. But wood wore out</p>
<p>easily. Iron was a much better material but iron was scarce</p>
<p>except in England. In England therefore most of the smelting</p>
<p>was done. To smelt iron, huge fires were needed. In the</p>
<p>beginning, these fires had been made of wood, but gradually</p>
<p>the forests had been used up. Then ``stone coal&#x27;&#x27; (the petrified</p>
<p>trees of prehistoric times) was used. But coal as you</p>
<p>know has to be dug out of the ground and it has to be transported</p>
<p>to the smelting ovens and the mines have to be kept</p>
<p>dry from the ever invading waters.</p>
<p>These were two problems which had to be solved at once.</p>
<p>For the time being, horses could still be used to haul the coal-</p>
<p>wagons, but the pumping question demanded the application</p>
<p>of special machinery. Several inventors were busy trying to</p>
<p>solve the difficulty. They all knew that steam would have to</p>
<p>be used in their new engine. The idea of the steam engine was</p>
<p>very old. Hero of Alexandria, who lived in the first century</p>
<p>before Christ, has described to us several bits of machinery</p>
<p>which were driven by steam. The people of the Renaissance</p>
<p>had played with the notion of steam-driven war chariots. The</p>
<p>Marquis of Worcester, a contemporary of Newton, in his book</p>
<p>of inventions, tells of a steam engine. A little later, in the year</p>
<p>1698, Thomas Savery of London applied for a patent for a</p>
<p>pumping engine. At the same time, a Hollander, Christian</p>
<p>Huygens, was trying to perfect an engine in which gun-powder</p>
<p>was used to cause regular explosions in much the same way as</p>
<p>we use gasoline in our motors.</p>
<p>All over Europe, people were busy with the idea. Denis</p>
<p>Papin, a Frenchman, friend and assistant of Huygens, was</p>
<p>making experiments with steam engines in several countries.</p>
<p>He invented a little wagon that was driven by steam, and a</p>
<p>paddle-wheel boat. But when he tried to take a trip in his</p>
<p>vessel, it was confiscated by the authorities on a complaint of</p>
<p>the boatmen&#x27;s union, who feared that such a craft would deprive</p>
<p>them of their livelihood. Papin finally died in London in</p>
<p>great poverty, having wasted all his money on his inventions.</p>
<p>But at the time of his death, another mechanical enthusiast,</p>
<p>Thomas Newcomen, was working on the problem of a new</p>
<p>steam-pump. Fifty years later his engine was improved upon</p>
<p>by James Watt, a Glasgow instrument maker. In the year</p>
<p>1777, he gave the world the first steam engine that proved of</p>
<p>real practical value.</p>
<p>But during the centuries of experiments with a ``heat-engine,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>the political world had greatly changed. The British</p>
<p>people had succeeded the Dutch as the common-carriers of the</p>
<p>world&#x27;s trade. They had opened up new colonies. They took</p>
<p>the raw materials which the colonies produced to England,</p>
<p>and there they turned them into finished products, and then</p>
<p>they exported the finished goods to the four corners of the</p>
<p>world. During the seventeenth century, the people of Georgia</p>
<p>and the Carolinas had begun to grow a new shrub which gave</p>
<p>a strange sort of woolly substance, the so-called ``cotton wool.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>After this had been plucked, it was sent to England and there</p>
<p>the people of Lancastershire wove it into cloth. This weaving</p>
<p>was done by hand and in the homes of the workmen. Very soon</p>
<p>a number of improvements were made in the process of weaving.</p>
<p>In the year 1730, John Kay invented the ``fly shuttle.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>In 1770, James Hargreaves got a patent on his ``spinning</p>
<p>jenny.&#x27;&#x27; Eli Whitney, an American, invented the cotton-gin,</p>
<p>which separated the cotton from its seeds, a job which had</p>
<p>previously been done by hand at the rate of only a pound a day.</p>
<p>Finally Richard Arkwright and the Reverend Edmund Cartwright</p>
<p>invented large weaving machines, which were driven by</p>
<p>water power. And then, in the eighties of the eighteenth</p>
<p>century, just when the Estates General of France had begun</p>
<p>those famous meetings which were to revolutionise the political</p>
<p>system of Europe, the engines of Watt were arranged in such</p>
<p>a way that they could drive the weaving machines of Arkwright,</p>
<p>and this created an economic and social revolution</p>
<p>which has changed human relationship in almost every part</p>
<p>of the world.</p>
<p>As soon as the stationary engine had proved a success, the</p>
<p>inventors turned their attention to the problem of propelling</p>
<p>boats and carts with the help of a mechanical contrivance.</p>
<p>Watt himself designed plans for a ``steam locomotive,&#x27;&#x27; but</p>
<p>ere he had perfected his ideas, in the year 1804, a locomotive</p>
<p>made by Richard Trevithick carried a load of twenty tons at</p>
<p>Pen-y-darran in the Wales mining district.</p>
<p>At the same time an American jeweller and portrait-painter</p>
<p>by the name of Robert Fulton was in Paris, trying to convince</p>
<p>Napoleon that with the use of his submarine boat, the</p>
<p><code>Nautilus,&#x27;&#x27; and his </code>steam-boat,&#x27;&#x27; the French might be able to</p>
<p>destroy the naval supremacy of England.</p>
<p>Fulton&#x27;s idea of a steamboat was not original. He had</p>
<p>undoubtedly copied it from John Fitch, a mechanical genius of</p>
<p>Connecticut whose cleverly constructed steamer had first navigated</p>
<p>the Delaware river as early as the year 1787. But Napoleon</p>
<p>and his scientific advisers did not believe in the practical</p>
<p>possibility of a self-propelled boat, and although the Scotch-</p>
<p>built engine of the little craft puffed merrily on the Seine, the</p>
<p>great Emperor neglected to avail himself of this formidable</p>
<p>weapon which might have given him his revenge for Trafalgar.</p>
<p>As for Fulton, he returned to the United States and, being</p>
<p>a practical man of business, he organised a successful steamboat</p>
<p>company together with Robert R. Livingston, a signer of</p>
<p>the Declaration of Independence, who was American Minister</p>
<p>to France when Fulton was in Paris, trying to sell his invention.</p>
<p>The first steamer of this new company, the ``Clermont,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>which was given a monopoly of all the waters of New York</p>
<p>State, equipped with an engine built by Boulton and Watt of</p>
<p>Birmingham in England, began a regular service between New</p>
<p>York and Albany in the year 1807.</p>
<p>As for poor John Fitch, the man who long before any one</p>
<p>else had used the ``steam-boat&#x27;&#x27; for commercial purposes, he</p>
<p>came to a sad death. Broken in health and empty of purse, he</p>
<p>had come to the end of his resources when his fifth boat, which</p>
<p>was propelled by means of a screw-propeller, had been destroyed.</p>
<p>His neighbours jeered at him as they were to laugh a</p>
<p>hundred years later when Professor Langley constructed his</p>
<p>funny flying machines. Fitch had hoped to give his country</p>
<p>an easy access to the broad rivers of the west and his countrymen</p>
<p>preferred to travel in flat-boats or go on foot. In the year</p>
<p>1798, in utter despair and misery, Fitch killed himself by taking</p>
<p>poison.</p>
<p>But twenty years later, the ``Savannah,&#x27;&#x27; a steamer of 1850</p>
<p>tons and making six knots an hour, (the Mauretania goes just</p>
<p>four times as fast,) crossed the ocean from Savannah to Liverpool</p>
<p>in the record time of twenty-five days. Then there was</p>
<p>an end to the derision of the multitude and in their enthusiasm</p>
<p>the people gave the credit for the invention to the wrong man.</p>
<p>Six years later, George Stephenson, a Scotchman, who had</p>
<p>been building locomotives for the purpose of hauling coal from</p>
<p>the mine-pit to smelting ovens and cotton factories, built his</p>
<p>famous ``travelling engine&#x27;&#x27; which reduced the price of coal by</p>
<p>almost seventy per cent and which made it possible to establish</p>
<p>the first regular passenger service between Manchester and</p>
<p>Liverpool, when people were whisked from city to city at the</p>
<p>unheard-of speed of fifteen miles per hour. A dozen years</p>
<p>later, this speed had been increased to twenty miles per hour.</p>
<p>At the present time, any well-behaved flivver (the direct descendant</p>
<p>of the puny little motor-driven machines of Daimler</p>
<p>and Levassor of the eighties of the last century) can do better</p>
<p>than these early ``Puffing Billies.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>But while these practically-minded engineers were improving</p>
<p>upon their rattling <code>heat engines,&#x27;&#x27; a group of </code>pure&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>scientists (men who devote fourteen hours of each day to the</p>
<p>study of those ``theoretical&#x27;&#x27; scientific phenomena without which</p>
<p>no mechanical progress would be possible) were following a</p>
<p>new scent which promised to lead them into the most secret and</p>
<p>hidden domains of Nature.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, a number of Greek and Roman</p>
<p>philosophers (notably Thales of Miletus and Pliny who was</p>
<p>killed while trying to study the eruption of Vesuvius of the</p>
<p>year 79 when Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried beneath</p>
<p>the ashes) had noticed the strange antics of bits of straw and of</p>
<p>feather which were held near a piece of amber which was being</p>
<p>rubbed with a bit of wool. The schoolmen of the Middle Ages</p>
<p>had not been interested in this mysterious ``electric&#x27;&#x27; power.</p>
<p>But immediately after the Renaissance, William Gilbert, the</p>
<p>private physician of Queen Elizabeth, wrote his famous treatise</p>
<p>on the character and behaviour of Magnets. During the</p>
<p>Thirty Years War Otto von Guericke, the burgomaster of</p>
<p>Magdeburg and the inventor of the air-pump, constructed the</p>
<p>first electrical machine. During the next century a large number</p>
<p>of scientists devoted themselves to the study of electricity.</p>
<p>Not less than three professors invented the famous Leyden</p>
<p>Jar in the year 1795. At the same time, Benjamin Franklin,</p>
<p>the most universal genius of America next to Benjamin Thomson</p>
<p>(who after his flight from New Hampshire on account of</p>
<p>his pro-British sympathies became known as Count Rumford)</p>
<p>was devoting his attention to this subject. He discovered that</p>
<p>lightning and the electric spark were manifestations of the same</p>
<p>electric power and continued his electric studies until the end of</p>
<p>his busy and useful life. Then came Volta with his famous</p>
<p>``electric pile&#x27;&#x27; and Galvani and Day and the Danish professor</p>
<p>Hans Christian Oersted and Ampere and Arago and Faraday,</p>
<p>all of them diligent searchers after the true nature of the electric</p>
<p>forces.</p>
<p>They freely gave their discoveries to the world and Samuel</p>
<p>Morse (who like Fulton began his career as an artist) thought</p>
<p>that he could use this new electric current to transmit messages</p>
<p>from one city to another. He intended to use copper</p>
<p>wire and a little machine which he had invented. People</p>
<p>laughed at him. Morse therefore was obliged to finance his</p>
<p>own experiments and soon he had spent all his money and</p>
<p>then he was very poor and people laughed even louder. He</p>
<p>then asked Congress to help him and a special Committee on</p>
<p>Commerce promised him their support. But the members of</p>
<p>Congress were not at all interested and Morse had to wait</p>
<p>twelve years before he was given a small congressional appropriation.</p>
<p>He then built a ``telegraph&#x27;&#x27; between Baltimore and</p>
<p>Washington. In the year 1887 he had shown his first successful</p>
<p>``telegraph&#x27;&#x27; in one of the lecture halls of New York</p>
<p>University. Finally, on the 24th of May of the year 1844 the</p>
<p>first long-distance message was sent from Washington to</p>
<p>Baltimore and to-day the whole world is covered with telegraph</p>
<p>wires and we can send news from Europe to Asia in a few</p>
<p>seconds. Twenty-three years later Alexander Graham Bell used</p>
<p>the electric current for his telephone. And half a century</p>
<p>afterwards Marconi improved upon these ideas by inventing a</p>
<p>system of sending messages which did away entirely with the old-</p>
<p>fashioned wires.</p>
<p>While Morse, the New Englander, was working on his</p>
<p>``telegraph,&#x27;&#x27; Michael Faraday, the Yorkshire-man, had constructed</p>
<p>the first ``dynamo.&#x27;&#x27; This tiny little machine was completed</p>
<p>in the year 1881 when Europe was still trembling as a</p>
<p>result of the great July revolutions which had so severely upset</p>
<p>the plans of the Congress of Vienna. The first dynamo grew</p>
<p>and grew and grew and to-day it provides us with heat and</p>
<p>with light (you know the little incandescent bulbs which Edison,</p>
<p>building upon French and English experiments of the forties</p>
<p>and fifties, first made in 1878) and with power for all sorts</p>
<p>of machines. If I am not mistaken the electric-engine will</p>
<p>soon entirely drive out the ``heat engine&#x27;&#x27; just as in the olden</p>
<p>days the more highly-organised prehistoric animals drove out</p>
<p>their less efficient neighbours.</p>
<p>Personally (but I know nothing about machinery) this will</p>
<p>make me very happy. For the electric engine which can be run</p>
<p>by waterpower is a clean and companionable servant of mankind</p>
<p>but the ``heat-engine,&#x27;&#x27; the marvel of the eighteenth century,</p>
<p>is a noisy and dirty creature for ever filling the world with</p>
<p>ridiculous smoke-stacks and with dust and soot and asking</p>
<p>that it be fed with coal which has to be dug out of mines at</p>
<p>great inconvenience and risk to thousands of people.</p>
<p>And if I were a novelist and not a historian, who must stick</p>
<p>to facts and may not use his imagination, I would describe the</p>
<p>happy day when the last steam locomotive shall be taken to the</p>
<p>Museum of Natural History to be placed next to the skeleton</p>
<p>of the Dynosaur and the Pteredactyl and the other extinct</p>
<p>creatures of a by-gone age.</p>
<p>THE SOCIAL REVOLUTION</p>
<p>BUT THE NEW ENGINES WERE VERY</p>
<p>EXPENSIVE AND ONLY PEOPLE OF WEALTH</p>
<p>COULD AFFORD THEM. THE OLD CARPENTER</p>
<p>OR SHOEMAKER WHO HAD BEEN HIS</p>
<p>OWN MASTER IN HIS LITTLE WORKSHOP</p>
<p>WAS OBLIGED TO HIRE HIMSELF OUT TO</p>
<p>THE OWNERS OF THE BIG MECHANICAL</p>
<p>TOOLS, AND WHILE HE MADE MORE</p>
<p>MONEY THAN BEFORE, HE LOST HIS</p>
<p>FORMER INDEPENDENCE AND HE DID NOT</p>
<p>LIKE THAT</p>
<p>IN the olden days the work of the world had been done by</p>
<p>independent workmen who sat in their own little workshops in</p>
<p>the front of their houses, who owned their tools, who boxed the</p>
<p>ears of their own apprentices and who, within the limits prescribed</p>
<p>by their guilds, conducted their business as it pleased</p>
<p>them. They lived simple lives, and were obliged to work very</p>
<p>long hours, but they were their own masters. If they got up</p>
<p>and saw that it was a fine day to go fishing, they went fishing</p>
<p>and there was no one to say ``no.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>But the introduction of machinery changed this. A machine</p>
<p>is really nothing but a greatly enlarged tool. A railroad</p>
<p>train which carries you at the speed of a mile a minute is</p>
<p>in reality a pair of very fast legs, and a steam hammer which</p>
<p>flattens heavy plates of iron is just a terrible big fist, made of</p>
<p>steel.</p>
<p>But whereas we can all afford a pair of good legs and a</p>
<p>good strong fist, a railroad train and a steam hammer and a</p>
<p>cotton factory are very expensive pieces of machinery and they</p>
<p>are not owned by a single man, but usually by a company of</p>
<p>people who all contribute a certain sum and then divide the</p>
<p>profits of their railroad or cotton mill according to the amount</p>
<p>of money which they have invested.</p>
<p>Therefore, when machines had been improved until they</p>
<p>were really practicable and profitable, the builders of those</p>
<p>large tools, the machine manufacturers, began to look for customers</p>
<p>who could afford to pay for them in cash.</p>
<p>During the early middle ages, when land had been almost</p>
<p>the only form of wealth, the nobility were the only people</p>
<p>who were considered wealthy. But as I have told you in a</p>
<p>previous chapter, the gold and silver which they possessed</p>
<p>was quite insignificant and they used the old system of barter,</p>
<p>exchanging cows for horses and eggs for honey. During</p>
<p>the crusades, the burghers of the cities had been able to gather</p>
<p>riches from the reviving trade between the east and the west,</p>
<p>and they had been serious rivals of the lords and the knights.</p>
<p>The French revolution had entirely destroyed the wealth</p>
<p>of the nobility and had enormously increased that of the middle</p>
<p>class or ``bourgeoisie.&#x27;&#x27; The years of unrest which followed the</p>
<p>Great Revolution had offered many middle-class people a</p>
<p>chance to get more than their share of this world&#x27;s goods. The</p>
<p>estates of the church had been confiscated by the French Convention</p>
<p>and had been sold at auction. There had been a terrific</p>
<p>amount of graft. Land speculators had stolen thousands</p>
<p>of square miles of valuable land, and during the Napoleonic</p>
<p>wars, they had used their capital to ``profiteer&#x27;&#x27; in grain and</p>
<p>gun-powder, and now they possessed more wealth than they</p>
<p>needed for the actual expenses of their households, and they</p>
<p>could afford to build themselves factories and to hire men and</p>
<p>women to work the machines.</p>
<p>This caused a very abrupt change in the lives of hundreds</p>
<p>of thousands of people. Within a few years, many cities</p>
<p>doubled the number of their inhabitants and the old civic centre</p>
<p>which had been the real ``home&#x27;&#x27; of the citizens was surrounded</p>
<p>with ugly and cheaply built suburbs where the workmen slept</p>
<p>after their eleven or twelve hours, or thirteen hours, spent in the</p>
<p>factories and from where they returned to the factory as soon</p>
<p>as the whistle blew.</p>
<p>Far and wide through the countryside there was talk of the</p>
<p>fabulous sums of money that could be made in the towns. The</p>
<p>peasant boy, accustomed to a life in the open, went to the city.</p>
<p>He rapidly lost his old health amidst the smoke and dust and</p>
<p>dirt of those early and badly ventilated workshops, and the</p>
<p>end, very often, was death in the poor-house or in the hospital.</p>
<p>Of course the change from the farm to the factory on the</p>
<p>part of so many people was not accomplished without a certain</p>
<p>amount of opposition. Since one engine could do as much</p>
<p>work as a hundred men, the ninety-nine others who were</p>
<p>thrown out of employment did not like it. Frequently they attacked</p>
<p>the factory-buildings and set fire to the machines, but</p>
<p>Insurance Companies had been organised as early as the 17th</p>
<p>century and as a rule the owners were well protected against loss.</p>
<p>Soon, newer and better machines were installed, the factory</p>
<p>was surrounded with a high wall and then there was an</p>
<p>end to the rioting. The ancient guilds could not possibly survive</p>
<p>in this new world of steam and iron. They went out of</p>
<p>existence and then the workmen tried to organise regular labour</p>
<p>unions. But the factory-owners, who through their wealth</p>
<p>could exercise great influence upon the politicians of the different</p>
<p>countries, went to the Legislature and had laws passed</p>
<p>which forbade the forming of such trade unions because they</p>
<p>interfered with the ``liberty of action&#x27;&#x27; of the working man.</p>
<p>Please do not think that the good members of Parliament</p>
<p>who passed these laws were wicked tyrants. They were</p>
<p>the true sons of the revolutionary period when everybody</p>
<p>talked of ``liberty&#x27;&#x27; and when people often killed their neighbours</p>
<p>because they were not quite as liberty-loving as they</p>
<p>ought to have been. Since ``liberty&#x27;&#x27; was the foremost virtue</p>
<p>of man, it was not right that labour-unions should dictate to</p>
<p>their members the hours during which they could work and</p>
<p>the wages which they must demand. The workman must at</p>
<p>all times, be ``free to sell his services in the open market,&#x27;&#x27; and</p>
<p>the employer must be equally ``free&#x27;&#x27; to conduct his business</p>
<p>as he saw fit. The days of the Mercantile System, when</p>
<p>the state had regulated the industrial life of the entire</p>
<p>community, were coming to an end. The new idea of ``freedom&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>insisted that the state stand entirely aside and let commerce</p>
<p>take its course.</p>
<p>The last half of the 18th century had not merely been a</p>
<p>time of intellectual and political doubt, but the old economic</p>
<p>ideas, too, had been replaced by new ones which better suited the</p>
<p>need of the hour. Several years before the French revolution,</p>
<p>Turgot, who had been one of the unsuccessful ministers of</p>
<p>finance of Louis XVI, had preached the novel doctrine of</p>
<p>``economic liberty.&#x27;&#x27; Turgot lived in a country which had</p>
<p>suffered from too much red-tape, too many regulations, too</p>
<p>many officials trying to enforce too many laws. ``Remove this</p>
<p>official supervision,&#x27;&#x27; he wrote, ``let the people do as they please,</p>
<p>and everything will be all right.&#x27;&#x27; Soon his famous advice of</p>
<p>``laissez faire&#x27;&#x27; became the battle-cry around which the economists</p>
<p>of that period rallied,</p>
<p>At the same time in England, Adam Smith was working</p>
<p>on his mighty volumes on the ``Wealth of Nations,&#x27;&#x27; which made</p>
<p>another plea for <code>liberty&#x27;&#x27; and the </code>natural rights of trade.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Thirty years later, after the fall of Napoleon, when the reactionary</p>
<p>powers of Europe had gained their victory at Vienna,</p>
<p>that same freedom which was denied to the people in their</p>
<p>political relations was forced upon them in their industrial</p>
<p>life.</p>
<p>The general use of machinery, as I have said at the beginning</p>
<p>of this chapter, proved to be of great advantage to the</p>
<p>state. Wealth increased rapidly. The machine made it possible</p>
<p>for a single country, like England, to carry all the burdens</p>
<p>of the great Napoleonic wars. The capitalists (the people</p>
<p>who provided the money with which machines were bought)</p>
<p>reaped enormous profits. They became ambitious and began</p>
<p>to take an interest in politics. They tried to compete with the</p>
<p>landed aristocracy which still exercised great influence upon</p>
<p>the government of most European countries.</p>
<p>In England, where the members of Parliament were still</p>
<p>elected according to a Royal Decree of the year 1265, and</p>
<p>where a large number of recently created industrial centres were</p>
<p>without representation, they brought about the passing of the</p>
<p>Reform Bill of the year 1882, which changed the electoral</p>
<p>system and gave the class of the factory-owners more influence</p>
<p>upon the legislative body. This however caused great</p>
<p>discontent among the millions of factory workers, who were</p>
<p>left without any voice in the government. They too began</p>
<p>an agitation for the right to vote. They put their demands</p>
<p>down in a document which came to be known as the ``People&#x27;s</p>
<p>Charter.&#x27;&#x27; The debates about this charter grew more and</p>
<p>more violent. They had not yet come to an end when the revolutions</p>
<p>of the year 1848 broke out. Frightened by the threat</p>
<p>of a new outbreak or Jacobinism and violence, the English</p>
<p>government placed the Duke of Wellington, who was now in</p>
<p>his eightieth year, at the head of the army, and called for</p>
<p>Volunteers. London was placed in a state of siege and</p>
<p>preparations were made to suppress the coming revolution.</p>
<p>But the Chartist movement killed itself through bad leadership</p>
<p>and no acts of violence took place. The new class of</p>
<p>wealthy factory owners, (I dislike the word ``bourgeoisie&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>which has been used to death by the apostles of a new social</p>
<p>order,) slowly increased its hold upon the government, and</p>
<p>the conditions of industrial life in the large cities continued to</p>
<p>transform vast acres of pasture and wheat-land into dreary</p>
<p>slums, which guard the approach of every modern European</p>
<p>town.</p>
<p>EMANCIPATION</p>
<p>THE GENERAL INTRODUCTION OF MACHINERY</p>
<p>DID NOT BRING ABOUT THE ERA OF</p>
<p>HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY WHICH</p>
<p>HAD BEEN PREDICTED BY THE GENERATION</p>
<p>WHICH SAW THE STAGE COACH REPLACED</p>
<p>BY THE RAILROAD. SEVERAL</p>
<p>REMEDIES WERE SUGGESTED BUT NONE</p>
<p>OF THESE QUITE SOLVED THE PROBLEM</p>
<p>IN the year 1831, just before the passing of the first Reform</p>
<p>Bill Jeremy Bentham, the great English student of legislative</p>
<p>methods and the most practical political reformer of that</p>
<p>day, wrote to a friend: ``The way to be comfortable is to</p>
<p>make others comfortable. The way to make others comfortable</p>
<p>is to appear to love them. The way to appear to love them</p>
<p>is to love them in reality.&#x27;&#x27; Jeremy was an honest man. He</p>
<p>said what he believed to be true. His opinions were shared by</p>
<p>thousands of his countrymen. They felt responsible for the</p>
<p>happiness of their less fortunate neighbours and they tried</p>
<p>their very best to help them. And Heaven knows it was time</p>
<p>that something be done!</p>
<p>The ideal of <code>economic freedom&#x27;&#x27; (the </code>laissez faire&#x27;&#x27; of</p>
<p>Turgot) had been necessary in the old society where mediaeval</p>
<p>restrictions lamed all industrial effort. But this ``liberty of</p>
<p>action&#x27;&#x27; which had been the highest law of the land had led to</p>
<p>a terrible, yea, a frightful condition. The hours in the fac-</p>
<p>tory were limited only by the physical strength of the workers.</p>
<p>As long as a woman could sit before her loom, without</p>
<p>fainting from fatigue, she was supposed to work. Children of</p>
<p>five and six were taken to the cotton mills, to save them from</p>
<p>the dangers of the street and a life of idleness. A law had</p>
<p>been passed which forced the children of paupers to go to work</p>
<p>or be punished by being chained to their machines. In return</p>
<p>for their services they got enough bad food to keep them alive</p>
<p>and a sort of pigsty in which they could rest at night. Often</p>
<p>they were so tired that they fell asleep at their job. To keep</p>
<p>them awake a foreman with a whip made the rounds and beat</p>
<p>them on the knuckles when it was necessary to bring them back</p>
<p>to their duties. Of course, under these circumstances thousands</p>
<p>of little children died. This was regrettable and the employers,</p>
<p>who after all were human beings and not without a heart, sincerely</p>
<p>wished that they could abolish ``child labour.&#x27;&#x27; But since</p>
<p>man was <code>free&#x27;&#x27; it followed that children were </code>free&#x27;&#x27; too.</p>
<p>Besides, if Mr. Jones had tried to work his factory without the</p>
<p>use of children of five and six, his rival, Mr. Stone, would have</p>
<p>hired an extra supply of little boys and Jones would have been</p>
<p>forced into bankruptcy. It was therefore impossible for Jones</p>
<p>to do without child labour until such time as an act of Parliament</p>
<p>should forbid it for all employers.</p>
<p>But as Parliament was no longer dominated by the old</p>
<p>landed aristocracy (which had despised the upstart factory-</p>
<p>owners with their money bags and had treated them with open</p>
<p>contempt), but was under control of the representatives from</p>
<p>the industrial centres, and as long as the law did not allow</p>
<p>workmen to combine in labour-unions, very little was accomplished.</p>
<p>Of course the intelligent and decent people of that</p>
<p>time were not blind to these terrible conditions. They were</p>
<p>just helpless. Machinery had conquered the world by surprise</p>
<p>and it took a great many years and the efforts of thousands</p>
<p>of noble men and women to make the machine what it</p>
<p>ought to be, man&#x27;s servant, and not his master.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the first attack upon the outrageous</p>
<p>system of employment which was then common in all parts of</p>
<p>the world, was made on behalf of the black slaves of Africa</p>
<p>and America. Slavery had been introduced into the American</p>
<p>continent by the Spaniards. They had tried to use the</p>
<p>Indians as labourers in the fields and in the mines, but the</p>
<p>Indians, when taken away from a life in the open, had lain down</p>
<p>and died and to save them from extinction a kind-hearted priest</p>
<p>had suggested that negroes be brought from Africa to do the</p>
<p>work. The negroes were strong and could stand rough treatment.</p>
<p>Besides, association with the white man would give</p>
<p>them a chance to learn Christianity and in this way, they would</p>
<p>be able to save their souls, and so from every possible point of</p>
<p>view, it would be an excellent arrangement both for the kindly</p>
<p>white man and for his ignorant black brother. But with the</p>
<p>introduction of machinery there had been a greater demand for</p>
<p>cotton and the negroes were forced to work harder than ever</p>
<p>before, and they too, like the Indians, began to die under the</p>
<p>treatment which they received at the hands of the overseers.</p>
<p>Stories of incredible cruelty constantly found their way to</p>
<p>Europe and in all countries men and women began to agitate</p>
<p>for the abolition of slavery. In England, William Wilberforce</p>
<p>and Zachary Macaulay, (the father of the great historian whose</p>
<p>history of England you must read if you want to know how</p>
<p>wonderfully interesting a history-book can be,) organised a</p>
<p>society for the suppression of slavery. First of all they got a</p>
<p>law passed which made ``slave trading&#x27;&#x27; illegal. And after the</p>
<p>year 1840 there was not a single slave in any of the British</p>
<p>colonies. The revolution of 1848 put an end to slavery in the</p>
<p>French possessions. The Portuguese passed a law in the year</p>
<p>1858 which promised all slaves their liberty in twenty years</p>
<p>from date. The Dutch abolished slavery in 1863 and in the</p>
<p>same year Tsar Alexander II returned to his serfs that liberty</p>
<p>which had been taken away from them more than two centuries</p>
<p>before.</p>
<p>In the United States of America the question led to grave</p>
<p>difficulties and a prolonged war. Although the Declaration</p>
<p>of Independence had laid down the principle that ``all men</p>
<p>were created free and equal,&#x27;&#x27; an exception had been made for</p>
<p>those men and women whose skins were dark and who worked</p>
<p>on the plantations of the southern states. As time went on, the</p>
<p>dislike of the people of the North for the institution of slavery</p>
<p>increased and they made no secret of their feelings. The southerners</p>
<p>however claimed that they could not grow their cotton</p>
<p>without slave-labour, and for almost fifty years a mighty debate</p>
<p>raged in both the Congress and the Senate.</p>
<p>The North remained obdurate and the South would not give</p>
<p>in. When it appeared impossible to reach a compromise, the</p>
<p>southern states threatened to leave the Union. It was a most</p>
<p>dangerous point in the history of the Union. Many things</p>
<p>``might&#x27;&#x27; have happened. That they did not happen was the</p>
<p>work of a very great and very good man.</p>
<p>On the sixth of November of the year 1860, Abraham Lincoln,</p>
<p>an Illinois lawyer, and a man who had made his own intellectual</p>
<p>fortune, had been elected president by the Republicans</p>
<p>who were very strong in the anti-slavery states. He</p>
<p>knew the evils of human bondage at first hand and his shrewd</p>
<p>common-sense told him that there was no room on the northern</p>
<p>continent for two rival nations. When a number of southern</p>
<p>states seceded and formed the ``Confederate States of America,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Lincoln accepted the challenge. The Northern states</p>
<p>were called upon for volunteers. Hundreds of thousands of</p>
<p>young men responded with eager enthusiasm and there followed</p>
<p>four years of bitter civil war. The South, better prepared</p>
<p>and following the brilliant leadership of Lee and Jackson,</p>
<p>repeatedly defeated the armies of the North. Then the</p>
<p>economic strength of New England and the West began to</p>
<p>tell. An unknown officer by the name of Grant arose from obscurity</p>
<p>and became the Charles Martel of the great slave war.</p>
<p>Without interruption he hammered his mighty blows upon the</p>
<p>crumbling defences of the South. Early in the year 1863,</p>
<p>President Lincoln issued his ``Emancipation Proclamation&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>which set all slaves free. In April of the year 1865 Lee</p>
<p>surrendered the last of his brave armies at Appomattox. A few</p>
<p>days later, President Lincoln was murdered by a lunatic. But</p>
<p>his work was done. With the exception of Cuba which was</p>
<p>still under Spanish domination, slavery had come to an end in</p>
<p>every part of the civilised world.</p>
<p>But while the black man was enjoying an increasing amount</p>
<p>of liberty, the ``free&#x27;&#x27; workmen of Europe did not fare quite so</p>
<p>well. Indeed, it is a matter of surprise to many contemporary</p>
<p>writers and observers that the masses of workmen (the so-</p>
<p>called proletariat) did not die out from sheer misery. They</p>
<p>lived in dirty houses situated in miserable parts of the slums.</p>
<p>They ate bad food. They received just enough schooling to</p>
<p>fit them for their tasks. In case of death or an accident, their</p>
<p>families were not provided for. But the brewery and distillery</p>
<p>interests, (who could exercise great influence upon the Legislature,)</p>
<p>encouraged them to forget their woes by offering them</p>
<p>unlimited quantities of whisky and gin at very cheap rates.</p>
<p>The enormous improvement which has taken place since the</p>
<p>thirties and the forties of the last century is not due to the efforts</p>
<p>of a single man. The best brains of two generations devoted</p>
<p>themselves to the task of saving the world from the disastrous</p>
<p>results of the all-too-sudden introduction of machinery.</p>
<p>They did not try to destroy the capitalistic system. This would</p>
<p>have been very foolish, for the accumulated wealth of other</p>
<p>people, when intelligently used, may be of very great benefit</p>
<p>to all mankind. But they tried to combat the notion that true</p>
<p>equality can exist between the man who has wealth and owns</p>
<p>the factories and can close their doors at will without the risk</p>
<p>of going hungry, and the labourer who must take whatever job</p>
<p>is offered, at whatever wage he can get, or face the risk of</p>
<p>starvation for himself, his wife and his children.</p>
<p>They endeavoured to introduce a number of laws which regulated</p>
<p>the relations between the factory owners and the factory</p>
<p>workers. In this, the reformers have been increasingly</p>
<p>successful in all countries. To-day, the majority of the labourers</p>
<p>are well protected; their hours are being reduced to the</p>
<p>excellent average of eight, and their children are sent to the</p>
<p>schools instead of to the mine pit and to the carding-room of</p>
<p>the cotton mills.</p>
<p>But there were other men who also contemplated the sight</p>
<p>of all the belching smoke-stacks, who heard the rattle of the</p>
<p>railroad trains, who saw the store-houses filled with a surplus</p>
<p>of all sorts of materials, and who wondered to what ultimate</p>
<p>goal this tremendous activity would lead in the years to come.</p>
<p>They remembered that the human race had lived for hundreds</p>
<p>of thousands of years without commercial and industrial competition.</p>
<p>Could they change the existing order of things and</p>
<p>do away with a system of rivalry which so often sacrificed human</p>
<p>happiness to profits?</p>
<p>This idea--this vague hope for a better day--was not restricted</p>
<p>to a single country. In England, Robert Owen, the</p>
<p>owner of many cotton mills, established a so-called ``socialistic</p>
<p>community&#x27;&#x27; which was a success. But when he died, the prosperity</p>
<p>of New Lanark came to an end and an attempt of Louis</p>
<p>Blanc, a French journalist, to establish ``social workshops&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>all over France fared no better. Indeed, the increasing number</p>
<p>of socialistic writers soon began to see that little individual</p>
<p>communities which remained outside of the regular industrial</p>
<p>life, would never be able to accomplish anything at all. It</p>
<p>was necessary to study the fundamental principles underlying</p>
<p>the whole industrial and capitalistic society before useful remedies</p>
<p>could be suggested.</p>
<p>The practical socialists like Robert Owen and Louis</p>
<p>Blanc and Francois Fournier were succeeded by theoretical</p>
<p>students of socialism like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Of</p>
<p>these two, Marx is the best known. He was a very brilliant</p>
<p>Jew whose family had for a long time lived in Germany. He</p>
<p>had heard of the experiments of Owen and Blanc and he began</p>
<p>to interest himself in questions of labour and wages and</p>
<p>unemployment. But his liberal views made him very unpopular</p>
<p>with the police authorities of Germany, and he was forced to</p>
<p>flee to Brussels and then to London, where he lived a poor and</p>
<p>shabby life as the correspondent of the New York Tribune.</p>
<p>No one, thus far, had paid much attention to his books on</p>
<p>economic subjects. But in the year 1864 he organised the first</p>
<p>international association of working men and three years later</p>
<p>in 1867, he published the first volume of his well-known trea-</p>
<p>tise called ``Capital.&#x27;&#x27; Marx believed that all history was a</p>
<p>long struggle between those who <code>have&#x27;&#x27; and those who </code>don&#x27;t</p>
<p>have.&#x27;&#x27; The introduction and general use of machinery had</p>
<p>created a new class in society, that of the capitalists who used</p>
<p>their surplus wealth to buy the tools which were then used by</p>
<p>the labourers to produce still more wealth, which was again used</p>
<p>to build more factories and so on, until the end of time. Meanwhile,</p>
<p>according to Marx, the third estate (the bourgeoisie)</p>
<p>was growing richer and richer and the fourth estate (the proletariat)</p>
<p>was growing poorer and poorer, and he predicted that</p>
<p>in the end, one man would possess all the wealth of the world</p>
<p>while the others would be his employees and dependent upon</p>
<p>his good will.</p>
<p>To prevent such a state of affairs, Marx advised working</p>
<p>men of all countries to unite and to fight for a number of political</p>
<p>and economic measures which he had enumerated in a Manifesto</p>
<p>in the year 1848, the year of the last great European</p>
<p>revolution.</p>
<p>These views of course were very unpopular with the governments</p>
<p>of Europe, many countries, especially Prussia, passed</p>
<p>severe laws against the Socialists and policemen were ordered</p>
<p>to break up the Socialist meetings and to arrest the speakers.</p>
<p>But that sort of persecution never does any good. Martyrs</p>
<p>are the best possible advertisements for an unpopular cause.</p>
<p>In Europe the number of socialists steadily increased and it</p>
<p>was soon clear that the Socialists did not contemplate a violent</p>
<p>revolution but were using their increasing power in the different</p>
<p>Parliaments to promote the interests of the labouring</p>
<p>classes. Socialists were even called upon to act as Cabinet</p>
<p>Ministers, and they co-operated with progressive Catholics and</p>
<p>Protestants to undo the damage that had been caused by the</p>
<p>Industrial Revolution and to bring about a fairer division of</p>
<p>the many benefits which had followed the introduction of machinery</p>
<p>and the increased production of wealth.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF SCIENCE</p>
<p>BUT THE WORLD HAD UNDERGONE ANOTHER</p>
<p>CHANGE WHICH WAS OF GREATER</p>
<p>IMPORTANCE THAN EITHER THE POLITICAL</p>
<p>OR THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONS.</p>
<p>AFTER GENERATIONS OF OPPRESSION</p>
<p>AND PERSECUTION, THE SCIENTIST HAD</p>
<p>AT LAST GAINED LIBERTY OF ACTION</p>
<p>AND HE WAS NOW TRYING TO DISCOVER</p>
<p>THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS WHICH GOVERN</p>
<p>THE UNIVERSE</p>
<p>THE Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Chaldeans, the Greeks</p>
<p>and the Romans, had all contributed something to the first</p>
<p>vague notions of science and scientific investigation. But the</p>
<p>great migrations of the fourth century had destroyed the classical</p>
<p>world of the Mediterranean, and the Christian Church, which</p>
<p>was more interested in the life of the soul than in the life of the</p>
<p>body, had regarded science as a manifestation of that human arrogance</p>
<p>which wanted to pry into divine affairs which belonged</p>
<p>to the realm of Almighty God, and which therefore was closely</p>
<p>related to the seven deadly sins.</p>
<p>The Renaissance to a certain but limited extent had broken</p>
<p>through this wall of Mediaeval prejudices. The Reformation,</p>
<p>however, which had overtaken the Renaissance in the early 16th</p>
<p>century, had been hostile to the ideals of the ``new civilisation,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>and once more the men of science were threatened with severe</p>
<p>punishment, should they try to pass beyond the narrow limits</p>
<p>of knowledge which had been laid down in Holy Writ.</p>
<p>Our world is filled with the statues of great generals, atop</p>
<p>of prancing horses, leading their cheering soldiers to glorious</p>
<p>victory. Here and there, a modest slab of marble announces</p>
<p>that a man of science has found his final resting place. A thousand</p>
<p>years from now we shall probably do these things differently,</p>
<p>and the children of that happy generation shall know</p>
<p>of the splendid courage and the almost inconceivable devotion</p>
<p>to duty of the men who were the pioneers of that abstract</p>
<p>knowledge, which alone has made our modern world a practical</p>
<p>possibility.</p>
<p>Many of these scientific pioneers suffered poverty and contempt</p>
<p>and humiliation. They lived in garrets and died in dungeons.</p>
<p>They dared not print their names on the title-pages of</p>
<p>their books and they dared not print their conclusions in the</p>
<p>land of their birth, but smuggled the manuscripts to some secret</p>
<p>printing shop in Amsterdam or Haarlem. They were exposed</p>
<p>to the bitter enmity of the Church, both Protestant and Catholic,</p>
<p>and were the subjects of endless sermons, inciting the parishioners</p>
<p>to violence against the ``heretics.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>Here and there they found an asylum. In Holland, where</p>
<p>the spirit of tolerance was strongest, the authorities, while</p>
<p>regarding these scientific investigations with little favour, yet</p>
<p>refused to interfere with people&#x27;s freedom of thought. It became</p>
<p>a little asylum for intellectual liberty where French and</p>
<p>English and German philosophers and mathematicians and</p>
<p>physicians could go to enjoy a short spell of rest and get a</p>
<p>breath of free air.</p>
<p>In another chapter I have told you how Roger Bacon, the</p>
<p>great genius of the thirteenth century, was prevented for years</p>
<p>from writing a single word, lest he get into new troubles with</p>
<p>the authorities of the church. And five hundred years later, the</p>
<p>contributors to the great philosophic ``Encyclopaedia&#x27;&#x27; were under</p>
<p>the constant supervision of the French gendarmerie. Half</p>
<p>a century afterwards, Darwin, who dared to question the story</p>
<p>of the creation of man, as revealed in the Bible, was denounced</p>
<p>from every pulpit as an enemy of the human race.</p>
<p>Even to-day, the persecution of those who venture into the</p>
<p>unknown realm of science has not entirely come to an end.</p>
<p>And while I am writing this Mr. Bryan is addressing a vast</p>
<p>multitude on the ``Menace of Darwinism,&#x27;&#x27; warning his hearers</p>
<p>against the errors of the great English naturalist.</p>
<p>All this, however, is a mere detail. The work that has to</p>
<p>be done invariably gets done, and the ultimate profit of the</p>
<p>discoveries and the inventions goes to the mass of those same people</p>
<p>who have always decried the man of vision as an unpractical idealist.</p>
<p>The seventeenth century had still preferred to investigate</p>
<p>the far off heavens and to study the position of our</p>
<p>planet in relation to the solar system. Even so, the Church had</p>
<p>disapproved of this unseemly curiosity, and Copernicus who</p>
<p>first of all had proved that the sun was the centre of the universe,</p>
<p>did not publish his work until the day of his death. Galileo</p>
<p>spent the greater part of his life under the supervision of the</p>
<p>clerical authorities, but he continued to use his telescope and</p>
<p>provided Isaac Newton with a mass of practical observations,</p>
<p>which greatly helped the English mathematician when he dis-</p>
<p>covered the existence of that interesting habit of falling objects</p>
<p>which came to be known as the Law of Gravitation.</p>
<p>That, for the moment at least, exhausted the interest in the</p>
<p>Heavens, and man began to study the earth. The invention</p>
<p>of a workable microscope, (a strange and clumsy little thing,)</p>
<p>by Anthony van Leeuwenhoek during the last half of the 17th</p>
<p>century, gave man a chance to study the ``microscopic&#x27;&#x27; creatures</p>
<p>who are responsible for so many of his ailments. It laid</p>
<p>the foundations of the science of ``bacteriology&#x27;&#x27; which in the</p>
<p>last forty years has delivered the world from a great number of</p>
<p>diseases by discovering the tiny organisms which cause the</p>
<p>complaint. It also allowed the geologists to make a more</p>
<p>careful study of different rocks and of the fossils (the petrified</p>
<p>prehistoric plants) which they found deep below the surface of</p>
<p>the earth. These investigations convinced them that the earth</p>
<p>must be a great deal older than was stated in the book of</p>
<p>Genesis and in the year 1830, Sir Charles Lyell published his</p>
<p>``Principles of Geology&#x27;&#x27; which denied the story of creation as</p>
<p>related in the Bible and gave a far more wonderful description</p>
<p>of slow growth and gradual development.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Marquis de Laplace was working on</p>
<p>a new theory of creation, which made the earth a little blotch</p>
<p>in the nebulous sea out of which the planetary system had</p>
<p>been formed and Bunsen and Kirchhoff, by the use of the</p>
<p>spectroscope, were investigating the chemical composition of the</p>
<p>stars and of our good neighbour, the sun, whose curious spots</p>
<p>had first been noticed by Galileo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile after a most bitter and relentless warfare with</p>
<p>the clerical authorities of Catholic and Protestant lands, the</p>
<p>anatomists and physiologists had at last obtained permission</p>
<p>to dissect bodies and to substitute a positive knowledge of our</p>
<p>organs and their habits for the guesswork of the mediaeval</p>
<p>quack.</p>
<p>Within a single generation (between 1810 and 1840) more</p>
<p>progress was made in every branch of science than in all the</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of years that had passed since man first</p>
<p>looked at the stars and wondered why they were there. It</p>
<p>must have been a very sad age for the people who had been</p>
<p>educated under the old system. And we can understand their</p>
<p>feeling of hatred for such men as Lamarck and Darwin, who</p>
<p>did not exactly tell them that they were ``descended from</p>
<p>monkeys,&#x27;&#x27; (an accusation which our grandfathers seemed to</p>
<p>regard as a personal insult,) but who suggested that the proud</p>
<p>human race had evolved from a long series of ancestors who</p>
<p>could trace the family-tree back to the little jelly-fishes who</p>
<p>were the first inhabitants of our planet.</p>
<p>The dignified world of the well-to-do middle class, which</p>
<p>dominated the nineteenth century, was willing to make use</p>
<p>of the gas or the electric light, of all the many practical applications</p>
<p>of the great scientific discoveries, but the mere investigator,</p>
<p>the man of the ``scientific theory&#x27;&#x27; without whom no</p>
<p>progress would be possible, continued to be distrusted until</p>
<p>very recently. Then, at last, his services were recognised. Today</p>
<p>the rich people who in past ages donated their wealth for</p>
<p>the building of a cathedral, construct vast laboratories where</p>
<p>silent men do battle upon the hidden enemies of mankind and</p>
<p>often sacrifice their lives that coming generations may enjoy</p>
<p>greater happiness and health.</p>
<p>Indeed it has come to pass that many of the ills of this</p>
<p>world, which our ancestors regarded as inevitable ``acts of</p>
<p>God,&#x27;&#x27; have been exposed as manifestations of our own ignorance</p>
<p>and neglect. Every child nowadays knows that he can</p>
<p>keep from getting typhoid fever by a little care in the choice of</p>
<p>his drinking water. But it took years and years of hard</p>
<p>work before the doctors could convince the people of this fact.</p>
<p>Few of us now fear the dentist chair. A study of the microbes</p>
<p>that live in our mouth has made it possible to keep our</p>
<p>teeth from decay. Must perchance a tooth be pulled, then we</p>
<p>take a sniff of gas, and go our way rejoicing. When the newspapers</p>
<p>of the year 1846 brought the story of the ``painless</p>
<p>operation&#x27;&#x27; which had been performed in America with the help</p>
<p>of ether, the good people of Europe shook their heads. To</p>
<p>them it seemed against the will of God that man should escape</p>
<p>the pain which was the share of all mortals, and it took a long</p>
<p>time before the practice of taking ether and chloroform for</p>
<p>operations became general.</p>
<p>But the battle of progress had been won. The breach in the</p>
<p>old walls of prejudice was growing larger and larger, and as</p>
<p>time went by, the ancient stones of ignorance came crumbling</p>
<p>down. The eager crusaders of a new and happier social order</p>
<p>rushed forward. Suddenly they found themselves facing a new</p>
<p>obstacle. Out of the ruins of a long-gone past, another citadel</p>
<p>of reaction had been erected, and millions of men had to give</p>
<p>their lives before this last bulwark was destroyed.</p>
<p>ART</p>
<p>A CHAPTER OF ART</p>
<p>WHEN a baby is perfectly healthy and has had enough to eat</p>
<p>and has slept all it wants, then it hums a little tune to show how</p>
<p>happy it is. To grown-ups this humming means nothing. It</p>
<p>sounds like ``goo-zum, goo-zum, goo-o-o-o-o,&#x27;&#x27; but to the baby</p>
<p>it is perfect music. It is his first contribution to art.</p>
<p>As soon as he (or she) gets a little older and is able to sit</p>
<p>up, the period of mud-pie making begins. These mud-pies do</p>
<p>not interest the outside world. There are too many million</p>
<p>babies, making too many million mud-pies at the same time.</p>
<p>But to the small infant they represent another expedition into</p>
<p>the pleasant realm of art. The baby is now a sculptor.</p>
<p>At the age of three or four, when the hands begin to obey</p>
<p>the brain, the child becomes a painter. His fond mother gives</p>
<p>him a box of coloured chalks and every loose bit of paper is</p>
<p>rapidly covered with strange pothooks and scrawls which represent</p>
<p>houses and horses and terrible naval battles.</p>
<p>Soon however this happiness of just ``making things&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>comes to an end. School begins and the greater part of the</p>
<p>day is filled up with work. The business of living, or rather</p>
<p>the business of ``making a living,&#x27;&#x27; becomes the most important</p>
<p>event in the life of every boy and girl. There is little time left</p>
<p>for ``art&#x27;&#x27; between learning the tables of multiplication and the</p>
<p>past participles of the irregular French verbs. And unless</p>
<p>the desire for making certain things for the mere pleasure of</p>
<p>creating them without any hope of a practical return be very</p>
<p>strong, the child grows into manhood and forgets that the</p>
<p>first five years of his life were mainly devoted to art.</p>
<p>Nations are not different from children. As soon as the</p>
<p>cave-man had escaped the threatening dangers of the long and</p>
<p>shivering ice-period, and had put his house in order, he began</p>
<p>to make certain things which he thought beautiful, although</p>
<p>they were of no earthly use to him in his fight with the wild</p>
<p>animals of the jungle. He covered the walls of his grotto with</p>
<p>pictures of the elephants and the deer which he hunted, and</p>
<p>out of a piece of stone, he hacked the rough figures of those</p>
<p>women he thought most attractive.</p>
<p>As soon as the Egyptians and the Babylonians and the</p>
<p>Persians and all the other people of the east had founded</p>
<p>their little countries along the Nile and the Euphrates, they</p>
<p>began to build magnificent palaces for their kings, invented</p>
<p>bright pieces of jewellery for their women and planted gardens</p>
<p>which sang happy songs of colour with their many bright flowers.</p>
<p>Our own ancestors, the wandering nomads from the distant</p>
<p>Asiatic prairies, enjoying a free and easy existence as</p>
<p>fighters and hunters, composed songs which celebrated the</p>
<p>mighty deeds of their great leaders and invented a form of</p>
<p>poetry which has survived until our own day. A thousand years</p>
<p>later, when they had established themselves on the Greek mainland,</p>
<p>and had built their ``city-states,&#x27;&#x27; they expressed their</p>
<p>joy (and their sorrows) in magnificent temples, in statues, in</p>
<p>comedies and in tragedies, and in every conceivable form of</p>
<p>art.</p>
<p>The Romans, like their Carthaginian rivals, were too busy</p>
<p>administering other people and making money to have much</p>
<p>love for ``useless and unprofitable&#x27;&#x27; adventures of the spirit.</p>
<p>They conquered the world and built roads and bridges but they</p>
<p>borrowed their art wholesale from the Greeks. They invented</p>
<p>certain practical forms of architecture which answered the</p>
<p>demands of their day and age. But their statues and their histories</p>
<p>and their mosaics and their poems were mere Latin imi-</p>
<p>tations of Greek originals. Without that vague and hard-to-</p>
<p>define something which the world calls ``personality,&#x27;&#x27; there can</p>
<p>be no art and the Roman world distrusted that particular sort</p>
<p>of personality. The Empire needed efficient soldiers and</p>
<p>tradesmen. The business of writing poetry or making pictures</p>
<p>was left to foreigners.</p>
<p>Then came the Dark Ages. The barbarian was the proverbial</p>
<p>bull in the china-shop of western Europe. He had no use</p>
<p>for what he did not understand. Speaking in terms of the year</p>
<p>1921, he liked the magazine covers of pretty ladies, but threw</p>
<p>the Rembrandt etchings which he had inherited into the ash-</p>
<p>can. Soon he came to learn better. Then he tried to undo the</p>
<p>damage which he had created a few years before. But the ash-</p>
<p>cans were gone and so were the pictures.</p>
<p>But by this time, his own art, which he had brought with</p>
<p>him from the east, had developed into something very beautiful</p>
<p>and he made up for his past neglect and indifference by the so-</p>
<p>called ``art of the Middle Ages&#x27;&#x27; which as far as northern Europe</p>
<p>is concerned was a product of the Germanic mind and had</p>
<p>borrowed but little from the Greeks and the Latins and nothing</p>
<p>at all from the older forms of art of Egypt and Assyria, not</p>
<p>to speak of India and China, which simply did not exist, as far</p>
<p>as the people of that time were concerned. Indeed, so little</p>
<p>had the northern races been influenced by their southern neighbours</p>
<p>that their own architectural products were completely</p>
<p>misunderstood by the people of Italy and were treated by</p>
<p>them with downright and unmitigated contempt.</p>
<p>You have all heard the word Gothic. You probably associate</p>
<p>it with the picture of a lovely old cathedral, lifting its slender</p>
<p>spires towards high heaven. But what does the word really</p>
<p>mean?</p>
<p>It means something <code>uncouth&#x27;&#x27; and </code>barbaric&#x27;&#x27;--something</p>
<p>which one might expect from an ``uncivilised Goth,&#x27;&#x27; a rough</p>
<p>backwoods-man who had no respect for the established rules of</p>
<p>classical art and who built his ``modern horrors&#x27;&#x27; to please his</p>
<p>own low tastes without a decent regard for the examples of</p>
<p>the Forum and the Acropolis.</p>
<p>And yet for several centuries this form of Gothic architecture</p>
<p>was the highest expression of the sincere feeling for art</p>
<p>which inspired the whole northern continent. From a previous</p>
<p>chapter, you will remember how the people of the late Middle</p>
<p>Ages lived. Unless they were peasants and dwelt in villages,</p>
<p>they were citizens of a <code>city&#x27;&#x27; or </code>civitas,&#x27;&#x27; the old Latin name</p>
<p>for a tribe. And indeed, behind their high walls and their deep</p>
<p>moats, these good burghers were true tribesmen who shared</p>
<p>the common dangers and enjoyed the common safety and prosperity</p>
<p>which they derived from their system of mutual protection.</p>
<p>In the old Greek and Roman cities the market-place, where</p>
<p>the temple stood, had been the centre of civic life. During</p>
<p>the Middle Ages, the Church, the House of God, became such a</p>
<p>centre. We modern Protestant people, who go to our church</p>
<p>only once a week, and then for a few hours only, hardly know</p>
<p>what a mediaeval church meant to the community. Then, before</p>
<p>you were a week old, you were taken to the Church to be</p>
<p>baptised. As a child, you visited the Church to learn the holy</p>
<p>stories of the Scriptures. Later on you became a member</p>
<p>of the congregation, and if you were rich enough you built</p>
<p>yourself a separate little chapel sacred to the memory of the</p>
<p>Patron Saint of your own family. As for the sacred edifice,</p>
<p>it was open at all hours of the day and many of the night. In</p>
<p>a certain sense it resembled a modern club, dedicated to all the</p>
<p>inhabitants of the town. In the church you very likely caught</p>
<p>a first glimpse of the girl who was to become your bride at a</p>
<p>great ceremony before the High Altar. And finally, when the</p>
<p>end of the journey had come, you were buried beneath the</p>
<p>stones of this familiar building, that all your children and their</p>
<p>grandchildren might pass over your grave until the Day of</p>
<p>Judgement.</p>
<p>Because the Church was not only the House of God but</p>
<p>also the true centre of all common life, the building had to be</p>
<p>different from anything that had ever been constructed by</p>
<p>the hands of man. The temples of the Egyptians and the</p>
<p>Greeks and the Romans had been merely the shrine of a local</p>
<p>divinity. As no sermons were preached before the images of</p>
<p>Osiris or Zeus or Jupiter, it was not necessary that the interior</p>
<p>offer space for a great multitude. All the religious processions</p>
<p>of the old Mediterranean peoples took place in the open. But</p>
<p>in the north, where the weather was usually bad,</p>
<p>most functions were held under the roof of the church.</p>
<p>During many centuries the architects struggled with</p>
<p>this problem of constructing a building that was large</p>
<p>enough. The Roman tradition taught them how to build heavy</p>
<p>stone walls with very small windows lest the walls lose</p>
<p>their strength. On the top of this they then placed a</p>
<p>heavy stone roof. But in the twelfth century, after the</p>
<p>beginning of the Crusades, when the architects had seen the</p>
<p>pointed arches of the Mohammedan builders, the western builders</p>
<p>discovered a new style which gave them their first chance to make</p>
<p>the sort of building which those days of an intense religious</p>
<p>life demanded. And then they developed this strange style upon</p>
<p>which the Italians bestowed the contemptuous name of ``Gothic&#x27;&#x27;or barbaric.</p>
<p>They achieved their purpose by inventing a vaulted roof which</p>
<p>was supported by ``ribs.&#x27;&#x27; But such a roof, if it became</p>
<p>too heavy, was apt to break the walls, just as a man</p>
<p>of three hundred pounds sitting down upon a child&#x27;s chair</p>
<p>will force it to collapse. To overcome this difficulty, certain</p>
<p>French architects then began to re-enforce the walls with</p>
<p>``buttresses&#x27;&#x27; which were merely heavy masses of stone against</p>
<p>which the walls could lean while they supported the roof. And</p>
<p>to assure the further safety of the roof they supported the ribs</p>
<p>of the roof by so-called ``flying buttresses,&#x27;&#x27; a very simple</p>
<p>method of construction which you will understand at once when</p>
<p>you look at our picture.</p>
<p>This new method of construction allowed the introduction</p>
<p>of enormous windows. In the twelfth century, glass was still</p>
<p>an expensive curiosity, and very few private buildings possessed</p>
<p>glass windows. Even the castles of the nobles were</p>
<p>without protection and this accounts for the eternal drafts</p>
<p>and explains why people of that day wore furs in-doors as</p>
<p>well as out.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the art of making coloured glass, with which</p>
<p>the ancient people of the Mediterranean had been familiar,</p>
<p>had not been entirely lost. There was a revival of stained</p>
<p>glass-making and soon the windows of the Gothic churches</p>
<p>told the stories of the Holy Book in little bits of brilliantly</p>
<p>coloured window-pane, which were caught in a long framework</p>
<p>of lead.</p>
<p>Behold, therefore, the new and glorious house of God,</p>
<p>filled with an eager multitude, ``living&#x27;&#x27; its religion as no people</p>
<p>have ever done either before or since! Nothing is considered</p>
<p>too good or too costly or too wondrous for this House of God</p>
<p>and Home of Man. The sculptors, who since the destruction</p>
<p>of the Roman Empire have been out of employment, haltingly</p>
<p>return to their noble art. Portals and pillars and buttresses</p>
<p>and cornices are all covered with carven images of Our Lord</p>
<p>and the blessed Saints. The embroiderers too are set to work</p>
<p>to make tapestries for the walls. The jewellers offer their</p>
<p>highest art that the shrine of the altar may be worthy of complete</p>
<p>adoration. Even the painter does his best. Poor man,</p>
<p>he is greatly handicapped by lack of a suitable medium.</p>
<p>And thereby hangs a story.</p>
<p>The Romans of the early Christian period had covered the</p>
<p>floors and the walls of their temples and houses with mosaics;</p>
<p>pictures made of coloured bits of glass. But this art had been</p>
<p>exceedingly difficult. It gave the painter no chance to express</p>
<p>all he wanted to say, as all children know who have ever tried to</p>
<p>make figures out of coloured blocks of wood. The art of</p>
<p>mosaic painting therefore died out during the late Middle</p>
<p>Ages except in Russia, where the Byzantine mosaic painters</p>
<p>had found a refuge after the fall of Constantinople and continued</p>
<p>to ornament the walls of the orthodox churches until</p>
<p>the day of the Bolsheviki, when there was an end to the building</p>
<p>of churches.</p>
<p>Of course, the mediaeval painter could mix his colours with</p>
<p>the water of the wet plaster which was put upon the walls of</p>
<p>the churches. This method of painting upon ``fresh plaster&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>(which was generally called <code>fresco&#x27;&#x27; or </code>fresh&#x27;&#x27; painting)</p>
<p>was very popular for many centuries. To-day, it is as rare</p>
<p>as the art of painting miniatures in manuscripts and among</p>
<p>the hundreds of artists of our modern cities there is perhaps</p>
<p>one who can handle this medium successfully. But during the</p>
<p>Middle Ages there was no other way and the artists were</p>
<p>``fresco&#x27;&#x27; workers for lack of something better. The method</p>
<p>however had certain great disadvantages. Very often the</p>
<p>plaster came off the walls after only a few years, or dampness</p>
<p>spoiled the pictures, just as dampness will spoil the pattern</p>
<p>of our wall paper. People tried every imaginable expedient</p>
<p>to get away from this plaster background. They tried to mix</p>
<p>their colours with wine and vinegar and with honey and with</p>
<p>the sticky white of egg, but none of these methods were satisfactory.</p>
<p>For more than a thousand years these experiments</p>
<p>continued. In painting pictures upon the parchment leaves</p>
<p>of manuscripts the mediaeval artists were very successful. But</p>
<p>when it came to covering large spaces of wood or stone with</p>
<p>paint which would stick, they did not succeed very well.</p>
<p>At last, during the first half of the fifteenth century, the</p>
<p>problem was solved in the southern Netherlands by Jan and</p>
<p>Hubert van Eyck. The famous Flemish brothers mixed their</p>
<p>paint with specially prepared oils and this allowed them to use</p>
<p>wood and canvas or stone or anything else as a background for</p>
<p>their pictures.</p>
<p>But by this time the religious ardour of the early Middle</p>
<p>Ages was a thing of the past. The rich burghers of the cities</p>
<p>were succeeding the bishops as patrons of the arts. And as</p>
<p>art invariably follows the full dinner-pail, the artists now began</p>
<p>to work for these worldly employers and painted pictures for</p>
<p>kings, for grand-dukes and for rich bankers. Within a very</p>
<p>short time, the new method of painting with oil spread through</p>
<p>Europe and in every country there developed a school of</p>
<p>special painting which showed the characteristic tastes of the</p>
<p>people for whom these portraits and landscapes were made.</p>
<p>In Spain, for example, Velasquez painted court-dwarfs</p>
<p>and the weavers of the royal tapestry-factories, and all sorts</p>
<p>of persons and subjects connected with the king and his court.</p>
<p>But in Holland, Rembrandt and Frans Hals and Vermeer</p>
<p>painted the barnyard of the merchant&#x27;s house, and they painted</p>
<p>his rather dowdy wife and his healthy but bumptious children</p>
<p>and the ships which had brought him his wealth. In Italy on</p>
<p>the other hand, where the Pope remained the largest patron</p>
<p>of the arts, Michelangelo and Correggio continued to paint</p>
<p>Madonnas and Saints, while in England, where the aristocracy</p>
<p>was very rich and powerful and in France where the</p>
<p>kings had become uppermost in the state, the artists painted</p>
<p>distinguished gentlemen who were members of the government,</p>
<p>and very lovely ladies who were friends of His Majesty.</p>
<p>The great change in painting, which came about with the</p>
<p>neglect of the old church and the rise of a new class in society,</p>
<p>was reflected in all other forms of art. The invention of printing</p>
<p>had made it possible for authors to win fame and reputation</p>
<p>by writing books for the multitudes. In this way arose</p>
<p>the profession of the novelist and the illustrator. But the</p>
<p>people who had money enough to buy the new books were not</p>
<p>the sort who liked to sit at home of nights, looking at the ceiling</p>
<p>or just sitting. They wanted to be amused. The few minstrels</p>
<p>of the Middle Ages were not sufficient to cover the demand for</p>
<p>entertainment. For the first time since the early Greek city-</p>
<p>states of two thousand years before, the professional playwright</p>
<p>had a chance to ply his trade. The Middle Ages had</p>
<p>known the theatre merely as part of certain church celebrations.</p>
<p>The tragedies of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries</p>
<p>had told the story of the suffering of our Lord. But</p>
<p>during the sixteenth century the worldly theatre made its</p>
<p>reappearance. It is true that, at first, the position of the</p>
<p>professional playwright and actor was not a very high one.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare was regarded as a sort of circus-fellow</p>
<p>who amused his neighbours with his tragedies and comedies.</p>
<p>But when he died in the year 1616 he had begun to enjoy the</p>
<p>respect of his neighbours and actors were no longer subjects</p>
<p>of police supervision.</p>
<p>William&#x27;s contemporary, Lope de Vega, the incredible</p>
<p>Spaniard who wrote no less than 1800 worldly and 400 religious</p>
<p>plays, was a person of rank who received the papal approval</p>
<p>upon his work. A century later, Moliere, the Frenchman,</p>
<p>was deemed worthy of the companionship of none less</p>
<p>than King Louis XIV.</p>
<p>Since then, the theatre has enjoyed an ever increasing</p>
<p>affection on the part of the people. To-day a ``theatre&#x27;&#x27; is part</p>
<p>of every well-regulated city, and the ``silent drama&#x27;&#x27; of the</p>
<p>movies has penetrated to the tiniest of our prairie hamlets.</p>
<p>Another art, however, was to become the most popular of</p>
<p>all. That was music. Most of the old art-forms demanded a</p>
<p>great deal of technical skill. It takes years and years of practice</p>
<p>before our clumsy hand is able to follow the commands of</p>
<p>the brain and reproduce our vision upon canvas or in marble.</p>
<p>It takes a life-time to learn how to act or how to write a good</p>
<p>novel. And it takes a great deal of training on the part of the</p>
<p>public to appreciate the best in painting and writing and</p>
<p>sculpture. But almost any one, not entirely tone-deaf, can</p>
<p>follow a tune and almost everybody can get enjoyment out of</p>
<p>some sort of music. The Middle Ages had heard a little music</p>
<p>but it had been entirely the music of the church. The holy</p>
<p>chants were subject to very severe laws of rhythm and harmony</p>
<p>and soon these became monotonous. Besides, they could not</p>
<p>well be sung in the street or in the market-place.</p>
<p>The Renaissance changed this. Music once more came</p>
<p>into its own as the best friend of man, both in his happiness and</p>
<p>in his sorrows.</p>
<p>The Egyptians and the Babylonians and the ancient Jews</p>
<p>had all been great lovers of music. They had even combined</p>
<p>different instruments into regular orchestras. But the Greeks</p>
<p>had frowned upon this barbaric foreign noise. They liked to</p>
<p>hear a man recite the stately poetry of Homer and Pindar.</p>
<p>They allowed him to accompany himself upon the lyre (the</p>
<p>poorest of all stringed instruments). That was as far as any</p>
<p>one could go without incurring the risk of popular disapproval.</p>
<p>The Romans on the other hand had loved orchestral music at</p>
<p>their dinners and parties and they had invented most of the</p>
<p>instruments which (in VERY modified form) we use to-day.</p>
<p>The early church had despised this music which smacked too</p>
<p>much of the wicked pagan world which had just been destroyed.</p>
<p>A few songs rendered by the entire congregation were</p>
<p>all the bishops of the third and fourth centuries would tolerate.</p>
<p>As the congregation was apt to sing dreadfully out of key without</p>
<p>the guidance of an instrument, the church had afterwards allowed</p>
<p>the use of an organ, an invention of the second century of our era</p>
<p>which consisted of a combination of the old pipes of Pan and</p>
<p>a pair of bellows.</p>
<p>Then came the great migrations. The last of the Roman</p>
<p>musicians were either killed or became tramp-fiddlers going</p>
<p>from city to city and playing in the street, and begging for</p>
<p>pennies like the harpist on a modern ferry-boat.</p>
<p>But the revival of a more worldly civilisation in the cities</p>
<p>of the late Middle Ages had created a new demand for musicians.</p>
<p>Instruments like the horn, which had been used only</p>
<p>as signal-instruments for hunting and fighting, were remodelled</p>
<p>until they could reproduce sounds which were agreeable in the</p>
<p>dance-hall and in the banqueting room. A bow strung with</p>
<p>horse-hair was used to play the old-fashioned guitar and before</p>
<p>the end of the Middle Ages this six-stringed instrument</p>
<p>(the most ancient of all string-instruments which dates back</p>
<p>to Egypt and Assyria) had grown into our modern four-</p>
<p>stringed fiddle which Stradivarius and the other Italian violin-</p>
<p>makers of the eighteenth century brought to the height of perfection.</p>
<p>And finally the modern piano was invented, the most wide-</p>
<p>spread of all musical instruments, which has followed man into</p>
<p>the wilderness of the jungle and the ice-fields of Greenland.</p>
<p>The organ had been the first of all keyed instruments but the</p>
<p>performer always depended upon the co-operation of some one</p>
<p>who worked the bellows, a job which nowadays is done by electricity.</p>
<p>The musicians therefore looked for a handier and less</p>
<p>circumstantial instrument to assist them in training the pupils</p>
<p>of the many church choirs. During the great eleventh century,</p>
<p>Guido, a Benedictine monk of the town of Arezzo (the</p>
<p>birthplace of the poet Petrarch) gave us our modern system</p>
<p>of musical annotation. Some time during that century, when</p>
<p>there was a great deal of popular interest in music, the first</p>
<p>instrument with both keys and strings was built. It must</p>
<p>have sounded as tinkly as one of those tiny children&#x27;s pianos</p>
<p>which you can buy at every toy-shop. In the city of Vienna,</p>
<p>the town where the strolling musicians of the Middle Ages</p>
<p>(who had been classed with jugglers and card sharps) had</p>
<p>formed the first separate Guild of Musicians in the year 1288,</p>
<p>the little monochord was developed into something which we</p>
<p>can recognise as the direct ancestor of our modern Steinway.</p>
<p>From Austria the ``clavichord&#x27;&#x27; as it was usually called in those</p>
<p>days (because it had ``craves&#x27;&#x27; or keys) went to Italy. There</p>
<p>it was perfected into the ``spinet&#x27;&#x27; which was so called after</p>
<p>the inventor, Giovanni Spinetti of Venice. At last during</p>
<p>the eighteenth century, some time between 1709 and 1720,</p>
<p>Bartolomeo Cristofori made a ``clavier&#x27;&#x27; which allowed the</p>
<p>performer to play both loudly and softly or as it was said in</p>
<p>Italian, <code>piano&#x27;&#x27; and </code>forte.&#x27;&#x27; This instrument with certain</p>
<p>changes became our ``pianoforte&#x27;&#x27; or piano.</p>
<p>Then for the first time the world possessed an easy and convenient</p>
<p>instrument which could be mastered in a couple of years</p>
<p>and did not need the eternal tuning of harps and fiddles and</p>
<p>was much pleasanter to the ears than the mediaeval tubas, clarinets,</p>
<p>trombones and oboes. Just as the phonograph has given</p>
<p>millions of modern people their first love of music so did the</p>
<p>early ``pianoforte&#x27;&#x27; carry the knowledge of music into much</p>
<p>wider circles. Music became part of the education of every well-</p>
<p>bred man and woman. Princes and rich merchants maintained</p>
<p>private orchestras. The musician ceased to be a wandering</p>
<p>``jongleur&#x27;&#x27; and became a highly valued member of the community.</p>
<p>Music was added to the dramatic performances of</p>
<p>the theatre and out of this practice, grew our modern Opera.</p>
<p>Originally only a few very rich princes could afford the expenses</p>
<p>of an ``opera troupe.&#x27;&#x27; But as the taste for this sort of</p>
<p>entertainment grew, many cities built their own theatres where</p>
<p>Italian and afterwards German operas were given to the unlimited</p>
<p>joy of the whole community with the exception of a few</p>
<p>sects of very strict Christians who still regarded music with</p>
<p>deep suspicion as something which was too lovely to be entirely</p>
<p>good for the soul.</p>
<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century the musical life</p>
<p>of Europe was in full swing. Then there came forward a</p>
<p>man who was greater than all others, a simple organist of the</p>
<p>Thomas Church of Leipzig, by the name of Johann Sebastian</p>
<p>Bach. In his compositions for every known instrument, from</p>
<p>comic songs and popular dances to the most stately of sacred</p>
<p>hymns and oratorios, he laid the foundation for all our modern</p>
<p>music. When he died in the year 1750 he was succeeded by</p>
<p>Mozart, who created musical fabrics of sheer loveliness which</p>
<p>remind us of lace that has been woven out of harmony and</p>
<p>rhythm. Then came Ludwig van Beethoven, the most tragic</p>
<p>of men, who gave us our modern orchestra, yet heard none of</p>
<p>his greatest compositions because he was deaf, as the result of a</p>
<p>cold contracted during his years of poverty.</p>
<p>Beethoven lived through the period of the great French</p>
<p>Revolution. Full of hope for a new and glorious day, he had</p>
<p>dedicated one of his symphonies to Napoleon. But he lived</p>
<p>to regret the hour. When he died in the year 1827, Napoleon</p>
<p>was gone and the French Revolution was gone, but the steam</p>
<p>engine had come and was filling the world with a sound that</p>
<p>had nothing in common with the dreams of the Third Symphony.</p>
<p>Indeed, the new order of steam and iron and coal and large</p>
<p>factories had little use for art, for painting and sculpture and</p>
<p>poetry and music. The old protectors of the arts, the Church</p>
<p>and the princes and the merchants of the Middle Ages and the</p>
<p>seventeenth and eighteenth centuries no longer existed. The</p>
<p>leaders of the new industrial world were too busy and had too</p>
<p>little education to bother about etchings and sonatas and bits</p>
<p>of carved ivory, not to speak of the men who created those</p>
<p>things, and who were of no practical use to the community in</p>
<p>which they lived. And the workmen in the factories listened</p>
<p>to the drone of their engines until they too had lost all taste</p>
<p>for the melody of the flute or fiddle of their peasant ancestry.</p>
<p>The arts became the step-children of the new industrial era.</p>
<p>Art and Life became entirely separated. Whatever paintings</p>
<p>had been left, were dying a slow death in the museums. And</p>
<p>music became a monopoly of a few ``virtuosi&#x27;&#x27; who took the</p>
<p>music away from the home and carried it to the concert-hall.</p>
<p>But steadily, although slowly, the arts are coming back into</p>
<p>their own. People begin to understand that Rembrandt and</p>
<p>Beethoven and Rodin are the true prophets and leaders of</p>
<p>their race and that a world without art and happiness resembles</p>
<p>a nursery without laughter.</p>
<p>COLONIAL EXPANSION AND WAR</p>
<p>A CHAPTER WHICH OUGHT TO GIVE YOU A</p>
<p>GREAT DEAL OF POLITICAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>ABOUT THE LAST FIFTY YEARS, BUT</p>
<p>WHICH REALLY CONTAINS SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS</p>
<p>AND A FEW APOLOGIES</p>
<p>IF I had known how difficult it was to write a History of</p>
<p>the World, I should never have undertaken the task. Of course,</p>
<p>any one possessed of enough industry to lose himself for half</p>
<p>a dozen years in the musty stacks of a library, can compile a</p>
<p>ponderous tome which gives an account of the events in every</p>
<p>land during every century. But that was not the purpose of</p>
<p>the present book. The publishers wanted to print a history</p>
<p>that should have rhythm--a story which galloped rather than</p>
<p>walked. And now that I have almost finished I discover that</p>
<p>certain chapters gallop, that others wade slowly through the</p>
<p>dreary sands of long forgotten ages--that a few parts do not</p>
<p>make any progress at all, while still others indulge in a veritable</p>
<p>jazz of action and romance. I did not like this and I suggested</p>
<p>that we destroy the whole manuscript and begin once</p>
<p>more from the beginning. This, however, the publishers would</p>
<p>not allow.</p>
<p>As the next best solution of my difficulties, I took the type-</p>
<p>written pages to a number of charitable friends and asked them</p>
<p>to read what I had said, and give me the benefit of their advice.</p>
<p>The experience was rather disheartening. Each and every</p>
<p>man had his own prejudices and his own hobbies and preferences.</p>
<p>They all wanted to know why, where and how I dared</p>
<p>to omit their pet nation, their pet statesman, or even their most</p>
<p>beloved criminal. With some of them, Napoleon and Jenghiz</p>
<p>Khan were candidates for high honours. I explained that I</p>
<p>had tried very hard to be fair to Napoleon, but that in my</p>
<p>estimation he was greatly inferior to such men as George</p>
<p>Washington, Gustavus Wasa, Augustus, Hammurabi or</p>
<p>Lincoln, and a score of others all of whom were obliged to</p>
<p>content themselves with a few paragraphs, from sheer lack of</p>
<p>space. As for Jenghiz Khan, I only recognise his superior</p>
<p>ability in the field of wholesale murder and I did not intend to</p>
<p>give him any more publicity than I could help.</p>
<p>``This is very well as far as it goes,&#x27;&#x27; said the next critic,</p>
<p>``but how about the Puritans? We are celebrating the tercentenary</p>
<p>of their arrival at Plymouth. They ought to have</p>
<p>more space.&#x27;&#x27; My answer was that if I were writing a history</p>
<p>of America, the Puritans would get fully one half of the first</p>
<p>twelve chapters; that however this was a history of mankind</p>
<p>and that the event on Plymouth rock was not a matter of far-</p>
<p>reaching international importance until many centuries later;</p>
<p>that the United States had been founded by thirteen colonies</p>
<p>and not by a single one; that the most prominent leaders of the</p>
<p>first twenty years of our history had been from Virginia, from</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, and from the island of Nevis, rather than from</p>
<p>Massachusetts; and that therefore the Puritans ought to content</p>
<p>themselves with a page of print and a special map.</p>
<p>Next came the prehistoric specialist. Why in the name of</p>
<p>the great Tyrannosaur had I not devoted more space to the</p>
<p>wonderful race of Cro-Magnon men, who had developed such</p>
<p>a high stage of civilisation 10,000 years ago?</p>
<p>Indeed, and why not? The reason is simple. I do not take</p>
<p>as much stock in the perfection of these early races as some of</p>
<p>our most noted anthropologists seem to do. Rousseau and</p>
<p>the philosophers of the eighteenth century created the ``noble</p>
<p>savage&#x27;&#x27; who was supposed to have dwelt in a state of perfect</p>
<p>happiness during the beginning of time. Our modern scientists</p>
<p>have discarded the ``noble savage,&#x27;&#x27; so dearly beloved by</p>
<p>our grandfathers, and they have replaced him by the ``splendid</p>
<p>savage&#x27;&#x27; of the French Valleys who 35,000 years ago made an</p>
<p>end to the universal rule of the low-browed and low-living</p>
<p>brutes of the Neanderthal and other Germanic neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>They have shown us the elephants the Cro-Magnon painted</p>
<p>and the statues he carved and they have surrounded him with</p>
<p>much glory.</p>
<p>I do not mean to say that they are wrong. But I hold that</p>
<p>we know by far too little of this entire period to re-construct</p>
<p>that early west-European society with any degree (however</p>
<p>humble) of accuracy. And I would rather not state certain</p>
<p>things than run the risk of stating certain things that were not</p>
<p>so.</p>
<p>Then there were other critics, who accused me of direct</p>
<p>unfairness. Why did I leave out such countries as Ireland</p>
<p>and Bulgaria and Siam while I dragged in such other countries</p>
<p>as Holland and Iceland and Switzerland? My answer</p>
<p>was that I did not drag in any countries. They pushed themselves</p>
<p>in by main force of circumstances, and I simply could</p>
<p>not keep them out. And in order that my point may be understood,</p>
<p>let me state the basis upon which active membership to</p>
<p>this book of history was considered.</p>
<p>There was but one rule. ``Did the country or the person</p>
<p>in question produce a new idea or perform an original act</p>
<p>without which the history of the entire human race would have</p>
<p>been different?&#x27;&#x27; It was not a question of personal taste. It</p>
<p>was a matter of cool, almost mathematical judgment. No race</p>
<p>ever played a more picturesque role in history than the Mongolians,</p>
<p>and no race, from the point of view of achievement or</p>
<p>intelligent progress, was of less value to the rest of mankind.</p>
<p>The career of Tiglath-Pileser, the Assyrian, is full of</p>
<p>dramatic episodes. But as far as we are concerned, he might just</p>
<p>as well never have existed at all. In the same way, the history</p>
<p>of the Dutch Republic is not interesting because once upon a</p>
<p>time the sailors of de Ruyter went fishing in the river Thames,</p>
<p>but rather because of the fact that this small mud-bank along</p>
<p>the shores of the North Sea offered a hospitable asylum to all</p>
<p>sorts of strange people who had all sorts of queer ideas upon</p>
<p>all sorts of very unpopular subjects.</p>
<p>It is quite true that Athens or Florence, during the hey-day</p>
<p>of their glory, had only one tenth of the population of Kansas</p>
<p>City. But our present civilisation would be very different</p>
<p>had neither of these two little cities of the Mediterranean basin</p>
<p>existed. And the same (with due apologies to the good people</p>
<p>of Wyandotte County) can hardly be said of this busy metropolis</p>
<p>on the Missouri River.</p>
<p>And since I am being very personal, allow me to state one</p>
<p>other fact.</p>
<p>When we visit a doctor, we find out before hand whether</p>
<p>he is a surgeon or a diagnostician or a homeopath or a faith</p>
<p>healer, for we want to know from what angle he will look at</p>
<p>our complaint. We ought to be as careful in the choice of our</p>
<p>historians as we are in the selection of our physicians. We</p>
<p>think, ``Oh well, history is history,&#x27;&#x27; and let it go at that. But</p>
<p>the writer who was educated in a strictly Presbyterian household</p>
<p>somewhere in the backwoods of Scotland will look differ-</p>
<p>ently upon every question of human relationships from his</p>
<p>neighbour who as a child, was dragged to listen to the brilliant</p>
<p>exhortations of Robert Ingersoll, the enemy of all revealed</p>
<p>Devils. In due course of time, both men may forget their</p>
<p>early training and never again visit either church or lecture</p>
<p>hall. But the influence of these impressionable years stays</p>
<p>with them and they cannot escape showing it in whatever they</p>
<p>write or say or do.</p>
<p>In the preface to this book, I told you that I should not be</p>
<p>an infallible guide and now that we have almost reached the</p>
<p>end, I repeat the warning. I was born and educated in an</p>
<p>atmosphere of the old-fashioned liberalism which had followed</p>
<p>the discoveries of Darwin and the other pioneers of the nineteenth</p>
<p>century. As a child, I happened to spend most of my</p>
<p>waking hours with an uncle who was a great collector of the</p>
<p>books written by Montaigne, the great French essayist of the</p>
<p>sixteenth century. Because I was born in Rotterdam and</p>
<p>educated in the city of Gouda, I ran continually across</p>
<p>Erasmus and for some unknown reason this great exponent</p>
<p>of tolerance took hold of my intolerant self. Later I discovered</p>
<p>Anatole France and my first experience with the English</p>
<p>language came about through an accidental encounter with</p>
<p>Thackeray&#x27;s ``Henry Esmond,&#x27;&#x27; a story which made more impression</p>
<p>upon me than any other book in the English language.</p>
<p>If I had been born in a pleasant middle western city I probably</p>
<p>should have a certain affection for the hymns which I had</p>
<p>heard in my childhood. But my earliest recollection of music</p>
<p>goes back to the afternoon when my Mother took me to hear</p>
<p>nothing less than a Bach fugue. And the mathematical perfection</p>
<p>of the great Protestant master influenced me to such</p>
<p>an extent that I cannot hear the usual hymns of our prayer-</p>
<p>meetings without a feeling of intense agony and direct pain.</p>
<p>Again, if I had been born in Italy and had been warmed</p>
<p>by the sunshine of the happy valley of the Arno, I might love</p>
<p>many colourful and sunny pictures which now leave me indifferent</p>
<p>because I got my first artistic impressions in a country</p>
<p>where the rare sun beats down upon the rain-soaked land with</p>
<p>almost cruel brutality and throws everything into violent contrasts</p>
<p>of dark and light.</p>
<p>I state these few facts deliberately that you may know</p>
<p>the personal bias of the man who wrote this history and may</p>
<p>understand his point-of-view. The bibliography at the end of</p>
<p>this book, which represents all sorts of opinions and views, will</p>
<p>allow you to compare my ideas with those of other people.</p>
<p>And in this way, you will be able to reach your own final</p>
<p>conclusions with a greater degree of fairness than would</p>
<p>otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>After this short but necessary excursion, we return to the</p>
<p>history of the last fifty years. Many things happened during</p>
<p>this period but very little occurred which at the time seemed</p>
<p>to be of paramount importance. The majority of the greater</p>
<p>powers ceased to be mere political agencies and became large</p>
<p>business enterprises. They built railroads. They founded and</p>
<p>subsidized steam-ship lines to all parts of the world. They</p>
<p>connected their different possessions with telegraph wires.</p>
<p>And they steadily increased their holdings in other continents.</p>
<p>Every available bit of African or Asiatic territory was claimed</p>
<p>by one of the rival powers. France became a colonial nation</p>
<p>with interests in Algiers and Madagascar and Annam and</p>
<p>Tonkin (in eastern Asia). Germany claimed parts of southwest</p>
<p>and east Africa, built settlements in Kameroon on the</p>
<p>west coast of Africa and in New Guinea and many of the</p>
<p>islands of the Pacific, and used the murder of a few missionaries</p>
<p>as a welcome excuse to take the harbour of Kisochau on the</p>
<p>Yellow Sea in China. Italy tried her luck in Abyssinia, was</p>
<p>disastrously defeated by the soldiers of the Negus, and consoled</p>
<p>herself by occupying the Turkish possessions in Tripoli</p>
<p>in northern Africa. Russia, having occupied all of Siberia,</p>
<p>took Port Arthur away from China. Japan, having defeated</p>
<p>China in the war of 1895, occupied the island of Formosa and</p>
<p>in the year 1905 began to lay claim to the entire empire of</p>
<p>Corea. In the year 1883 England, the largest colonial empire</p>
<p>the world has ever seen, undertook to ``protect&#x27;&#x27; Egypt. She</p>
<p>performed this task most efficiently and to the great material</p>
<p>benefit of that much neglected country, which ever since the</p>
<p>opening of the Suez canal in 1868 had been threatened with a</p>
<p>foreign invasion. During the next thirty years she fought a</p>
<p>number of colonial wars in different parts of the world and in</p>
<p>1902 (after three years of bitter fighting) she conquered the</p>
<p>independent Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange</p>
<p>Free State. Meanwhile she had encouraged Cecil Rhodes to</p>
<p>lay the foundations for a great African state, which reached</p>
<p>from the Cape almost to the mouth of the Nile, and had faithfully</p>
<p>picked up such islands or provinces as had been left without</p>
<p>a European owner.</p>
<p>The shrewd king of Belgium, by name Leopold, used</p>
<p>the discoveries of Henry Stanley to found the Congo Free</p>
<p>State in the year 1885. Originally this gigantic tropical empire</p>
<p>was an ``absolute monarchy.&#x27;&#x27; But after many years of</p>
<p>scandalous mismanagement, it was annexed by the Belgian</p>
<p>people who made it a colony (in the year 1908) and abolished</p>
<p>the terrible abuses which had been tolerated by this very</p>
<p>unscrupulous Majesty, who cared nothing for the fate of the</p>
<p>natives as long as he got his ivory and rubber.</p>
<p>As for the United States, they had so much land that they</p>
<p>desired no further territory. But the terrible misrule of</p>
<p>Cuba, one of the last of the Spanish possessions in the western</p>
<p>hemisphere, practically forced the Washington government to</p>
<p>take action. After a short and rather uneventful war, the</p>
<p>Spaniards were driven out of Cuba and Puerto Rico and the</p>
<p>Philippines, and the two latter became colonies of the United</p>
<p>States.</p>
<p>This economic development of the world was perfectly</p>
<p>natural. The increasing number of factories in England and</p>
<p>France and Germany needed an ever increasing amount of raw</p>
<p>materials and the equally increasing number of European</p>
<p>workers needed an ever increasing amount of food. Everywhere</p>
<p>the cry was for more and for richer markets, for more</p>
<p>easily accessible coal mines and iron mines and rubber plantations</p>
<p>and oil-wells, for greater supplies of wheat and grain.</p>
<p>The purely political events of the European continent</p>
<p>dwindled to mere insignificance in the eyes of men who were</p>
<p>making plans for steamboat lines on Victoria Nyanza or</p>
<p>for railroads through the interior of Shantung. They knew</p>
<p>that many European questions still remained to be settled, but</p>
<p>they did not bother, and through sheer indifference and carelessness</p>
<p>they bestowed upon their descendants a terrible inheritance</p>
<p>of hate and misery. For untold centuries the south-eastern</p>
<p>corner of Europe had been the scene of rebellion and bloodshed.</p>
<p>During the seventies of the last century the people of</p>
<p>Serbia and Bulgaria and Montenegro and Roumania were once</p>
<p>more trying to gain their freedom and the Turks (with the</p>
<p>support of many of the western powers), were trying to prevent</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>After a period of particularly atrocious massacres in Bulgaria</p>
<p>in the year 1876, the Russian people lost all patience.</p>
<p>The Government was forced to intervene just as President McKinley</p>
<p>was obliged to go to Cuba and stop the shooting-squads</p>
<p>of General Weyler in Havana. In April of the year 1877 the</p>
<p>Russian armies crossed the Danube, stormed the Shipka pass,</p>
<p>and after the capture of Plevna, marched southward until they</p>
<p>reached the gates of Constantinople. Turkey appealed for</p>
<p>help to England. There were many English people who denounced</p>
<p>their government when it took the side of the Sultan.</p>
<p>But Disraeli (who had just made Queen Victoria Empress of</p>
<p>India and who loved the picturesque Turks while he hated the</p>
<p>Russians who were brutally cruel to the Jewish people within</p>
<p>their frontiers) decided to interfere. Russia was forced to</p>
<p>conclude the peace of San Stefano (1878) and the question of</p>
<p>the Balkans was left to a Congress which convened at Berlin</p>
<p>in June and July of the same year.</p>
<p>This famous conference was entirely dominated by the personality</p>
<p>of Disraeli. Even Bismarck feared the clever old</p>
<p>man with his well-oiled curly hair and his supreme arrogance,</p>
<p>tempered by a cynical sense of humor and a marvellous gift</p>
<p>for flattery. At Berlin the British prime-minister carefully</p>
<p>watched over the fate of his friends the Turks. Montenegro,</p>
<p>Serbia and Roumania were recognised as independent kingdoms.</p>
<p>The principality of Bulgaria was given a semi-independent</p>
<p>status under Prince Alexander of Battenberg, a</p>
<p>nephew of Tsar Alexander II. But none of those countries</p>
<p>were given the chance to develop their powers and their resources</p>
<p>as they would have been able to do, had England been</p>
<p>less anxious about the fate of the Sultan, whose domains were</p>
<p>necessary to the safety of the British Empire as a bulwark</p>
<p>against further Russian aggression.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the congress allowed Austria to</p>
<p>take Bosnia and Herzegovina away from the Turks to be</p>
<p>``administered&#x27;&#x27; as part of the Habsburg domains. It is true</p>
<p>that Austria made an excellent job of it. The neglected provinces</p>
<p>were as well managed as the best of the British colonies,</p>
<p>and that is saying a great deal. But they were inhabited by</p>
<p>many Serbians. In older days they had been part of the great</p>
<p>Serbian empire of Stephan Dushan, who early in the fourteenth</p>
<p>century had defended western Europe against the invasions</p>
<p>of the Turks and whose capital of Uskub had been a</p>
<p>centre of civilisation one hundred and fifty years before Columbus</p>
<p>discovered the new lands of the west. The Serbians remem-</p>
<p>bered their ancient glory as who would not? They resented</p>
<p>the presence of the Austrians in two provinces, which, so they</p>
<p>felt, were theirs by every right of tradition.</p>
<p>And it was in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, that the</p>
<p>archduke Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne, was murdered</p>
<p>on June 28 of the year 1914. The assassin was a Serbian</p>
<p>student who had acted from purely patriotic motives.</p>
<p>But the blame for this terrible catastrophe which was the</p>
<p>immediate, though not the only cause of the Great World War</p>
<p>did not lie with the half-crazy Serbian boy or his Austrian</p>
<p>victim. It must be traced back to the days of the famous</p>
<p>Berlin Conference when Europe was too busy building a material</p>
<p>civilisation to care about the aspirations and the dreams</p>
<p>of a forgotten race in a dreary corner of the old Balkan</p>
<p>peninsula.</p>
<p>A NEW WORLD</p>
<p>THE GREAT WAR WHICH WAS REALLY THE</p>
<p>STRUGGLE FOR A NEW AND</p>
<p>BETTER WORLD</p>
<p>THE Marquis de Condorcet was one of the noblest characters</p>
<p>among the small group of honest enthusiasts who were</p>
<p>responsible for the outbreak of the great French Revolution.</p>
<p>He had devoted his life to the cause of the poor and the unfortunate.</p>
<p>He had been one of the assistants of d&#x27;Alembert and</p>
<p>Diderot when they wrote their famous Encyclopedie. During</p>
<p>the first years of the Revolution he had been the leader of the</p>
<p>Moderate wing of the Convention.</p>
<p>His tolerance, his kindliness, his stout common sense, had</p>
<p>made him an object of suspicion when the treason of the king</p>
<p>and the court clique had given the extreme radicals their chance</p>
<p>to get hold of the government and kill their opponents.</p>
<p>Condorcet was declared ``hors de loi,&#x27;&#x27; or outlawed, an outcast</p>
<p>who was henceforth at the mercy of every true patriot. His</p>
<p>friends offered to hide him at their own peril. Condorcet</p>
<p>refused to accept their sacrifice. He escaped and tried to reach</p>
<p>his home, where he might be safe. After three nights in the</p>
<p>open, torn and bleeding, he entered an inn and asked for some</p>
<p>food. The suspicious yokels searched him and in his pockets</p>
<p>they found a copy of Horace, the Latin poet. This showed</p>
<p>that their prisoner was a man of gentle breeding and had no</p>
<p>business upon the highroads at a time when every educated</p>
<p>person was regarded as an enemy of the Revolutionary state.</p>
<p>They took Condorcet and they bound him and they gagged</p>
<p>him and they threw him into the village lock-up, but in the</p>
<p>morning when the soldiers came to drag him back to Paris and</p>
<p>cut his head off, behold! he was dead.</p>
<p>This man who had given all and had received nothing had</p>
<p>good reason to despair of the human race. But he has written</p>
<p>a few sentences which ring as true to-day as they did one</p>
<p>hundred and thirty years ago. I repeat them here for your</p>
<p>benefit.</p>
<p><code>Nature has set no limits to our hopes,&#x27;&#x27; he wrote, </code>and</p>
<p>the picture of the human race, now freed from its chains and</p>
<p>marching with a firm tread on the road of truth and virtue</p>
<p>and happiness, offers to the philosopher a spectacle which</p>
<p>consoles him for the errors, for the crimes and the injustices</p>
<p>which still pollute and afflict this earth.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The world has just passed through an agony of pain compared</p>
<p>to which the French Revolution was a mere incident.</p>
<p>The shock has been so great that it has killed the last spark of</p>
<p>hope in the breasts of millions of men. They were chanting a</p>
<p>hymn of progress, and four years of slaughter followed their</p>
<p>prayers for peace. <code>Is it worth while,&#x27;&#x27; so they ask, </code>to work</p>
<p>and slave for the benefit of creatures who have not yet passed</p>
<p>beyond the stage of the earliest cave men?&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>There is but one answer.</p>
<p>That answer is ``Yes!&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>The World War was a terrible calamity. But it did not</p>
<p>mean the end of things. On the contrary it brought about the</p>
<p>coming of a new day.</p>
<p>It is easy to write a history of Greece and Rome or the</p>
<p>Middle Ages. The actors who played their parts upon that</p>
<p>long-forgotten stage are all dead. We can criticize them with</p>
<p>a cool head. The audience that applauded their efforts has</p>
<p>dispersed. Our remarks cannot possibly hurt their feelings.</p>
<p>But it is very difficult to give a true account of contemporary</p>
<p>events. The problems that fill the minds of the people</p>
<p>with whom we pass through life, are our own problems, and</p>
<p>they hurt us too much or they please us too well to be described</p>
<p>with that fairness which is necessary when we are writing</p>
<p>history and not blowing the trumpet of propaganda. All</p>
<p>the same I shall endeavour to tell you why I agree with poor</p>
<p>Condorcet when he expressed his firm faith in a better future.</p>
<p>Often before have I warned you against the false impression</p>
<p>which is created by the use of our so-called historical</p>
<p>epochs which divide the story of man into four parts, the ancient</p>
<p>world, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Reformation,</p>
<p>and Modern Time. The last of these terms is the most</p>
<p>dangerous. The word ``modern&#x27;&#x27; implies that we, the people</p>
<p>of the twentieth century, are at the top of human achievement.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago the liberals of England who followed the leadership</p>
<p>of Gladstone felt that the problem of a truly representative</p>
<p>and democratic form of government had been solved forever</p>
<p>by the second great Reform Bill, which gave workmen</p>
<p>an equal share in the government with their employers. When</p>
<p>Disraeli and his conservative friends talked of a dangerous</p>
<p><code>leap in the dark&#x27;&#x27; they answered </code>No.&#x27;&#x27; They felt certain of</p>
<p>their cause and trusted that henceforth all classes of society</p>
<p>would co-operate to make the government of their common</p>
<p>country a success. Since then many things have happened,</p>
<p>and the few liberals who are still alive begin to understand</p>
<p>that they were mistaken.</p>
<p>There is no definite answer to any historical problem.</p>
<p>Every generation must fight the good fight anew or perish</p>
<p>as those sluggish animals of the prehistoric world have</p>
<p>perished.</p>
<p>If you once get hold of this great truth you will get a new</p>
<p>and much broader view of life. Then, go one step further</p>
<p>and try to imagine yourself in the position of your own great-</p>
<p>great-grandchildren who will take your place in the year</p>
<p>10,000. They too will learn history. But what will they</p>
<p>think of those short four thousand years during which we have</p>
<p>kept a written record of our actions and of our thoughts?</p>
<p>They will think of Napoleon as a contemporary of Tiglath</p>
<p>Pileser, the Assyrian conqueror. Perhaps they will confuse</p>
<p>him with Jenghiz Khan or Alexander the Macedonian. The</p>
<p>great war which has just come to an end will appear in the light</p>
<p>of that long commercial conflict which settled the supremacy</p>
<p>of the Mediterranean when Rome and Carthage fought during</p>
<p>one hundred and twenty-eight years for the mastery of the sea.</p>
<p>The Balkan troubles of the 19th century (the struggle for</p>
<p>freedom of Serbia and Greece and Bulgaria and Montenegro)</p>
<p>to them will seem a continuation of the disordered conditions</p>
<p>caused by the Great Migrations. They will look at pictures</p>
<p>of the Rheims cathedral which only yesterday was destroyed</p>
<p>by German guns as we look upon a photograph of the Acropolis</p>
<p>ruined two hundred and fifty years ago during a war</p>
<p>between the Turks and the Venetians. They will regard the</p>
<p>fear of death, which is still common among many people, as a</p>
<p>childish superstition which was perhaps natural in a race of</p>
<p>men who had burned witches as late as the year 1692. Even</p>
<p>our hospitals and our laboratories and our operating rooms</p>
<p>of which we are so proud will look like slightly improved</p>
<p>workshops of alchemists and mediaeval surgeons.</p>
<p>And the reason for all this is simple. We modern men and</p>
<p>women are not ``modern&#x27;&#x27; at all. On the contrary we still</p>
<p>belong to the last generations of the cave-dwellers. The foundation</p>
<p>for a new era was laid but yesterday. The human race</p>
<p>was given its first chance to become truly civilised when it took</p>
<p>courage to question all things and made ``knowledge and</p>
<p>understanding&#x27;&#x27; the foundation upon which to create a more</p>
<p>reasonable and sensible society of human beings. The Great</p>
<p>War was the ``growing-pain&#x27;&#x27; of this new world.</p>
<p>For a long time to come people will write mighty books to</p>
<p>prove that this or that or the other person brought about the</p>
<p>war. The Socialists will publish volumes in which they will ac-</p>
<p>cuse the <code>capitalists&#x27;&#x27; of having brought about the war for </code>commercial</p>
<p>gain.&#x27;&#x27; The capitalists will answer that they lost infinitely</p>
<p>more through the war than they made--that their children</p>
<p>were among the first to go and fight and be killed--and</p>
<p>they will show how in every country the bankers tried their</p>
<p>very best to avert the outbreak of hostilities. French historians</p>
<p>will go through the register of German sins from the</p>
<p>days of Charlemagne until the days of William of Hohenzollern</p>
<p>and German historians will return the compliment and</p>
<p>will go through the list of French horrors from the days of</p>
<p>Charlemagne until the days of President Poincare. And</p>
<p>then they will establish to their own satisfaction that the other</p>
<p>fellow was guilty of ``causing the war.&#x27;&#x27; Statesmen, dead and</p>
<p>not yet dead, in all countries will take to their typewriters and</p>
<p>they will explain how they tried to avert hostilities and how</p>
<p>their wicked opponents forced them into it.</p>
<p>The historian, a hundred years hence, will not bother about</p>
<p>these apologies and vindications. He will understand the real</p>
<p>nature of the underlying causes and he will know that personal</p>
<p>ambitions and personal wickedness and personal greed had very</p>
<p>little to do with the final outburst. The original mistake, which</p>
<p>was responsible for all this misery, was committed when our</p>
<p>scientists began to create a new world of steel and iron and</p>
<p>chemistry and electricity and forgot that the human mind is</p>
<p>slower than the proverbial turtle, is lazier than the well-known</p>
<p>sloth, and marches from one hundred to three hundred years</p>
<p>behind the small group of courageous leaders.</p>
<p>A Zulu in a frock coat is still a Zulu. A dog trained to ride</p>
<p>a bicycle and smoke a pipe is still a dog. And a human being</p>
<p>with the mind of a sixteenth century tradesman driving a 1921</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce is still a human being with the mind of a sixteenth</p>
<p>century tradesman.</p>
<p>If you do not understand this at first, read it again. It</p>
<p>will become clearer to you in a moment and it will explain</p>
<p>many things that have happened these last six years.</p>
<p>Perhaps I may give you another, more familiar, example,</p>
<p>to show you what I mean. In the movie theatres, jokes and</p>
<p>funny remarks are often thrown upon the screen. Watch the</p>
<p>audience the next time you have a chance. A few people seem</p>
<p>almost to inhale the words. It takes them but a second to read</p>
<p>the lines. Others are a bit slower. Still others take from</p>
<p>twenty to thirty seconds. Finally those men and women who</p>
<p>do not read any more than they can help, get the point when</p>
<p>the brighter ones among the audience have already begun to</p>
<p>decipher the next cut-in. It is not different in human life,</p>
<p>as I shall now show you.</p>
<p>In a former chapter I have told you how the idea of the</p>
<p>Roman Empire continued to live for a thousand years after</p>
<p>the death of the last Roman Emperor. It caused the establishment</p>
<p>of a large number of ``imitation empires.&#x27;&#x27; It gave the</p>
<p>Bishops of Rome a chance to make themselves the head of the</p>
<p>entire church, because they represented the idea of Roman</p>
<p>world-supremacy. It drove a number of perfectly harmless</p>
<p>barbarian chieftains into a career of crime and endless warfare</p>
<p>because they were for ever under the spell of this magic</p>
<p>word ``Rome.&#x27;&#x27; All these people, Popes, Emperors and plain</p>
<p>fighting men were not very different from you or me. But</p>
<p>they lived in a world where the Roman tradition was a vital</p>
<p>issue something living--something which was remembered</p>
<p>clearly both by the father and the son and the grandson. And</p>
<p>so they struggled and sacrificed themselves for a cause which</p>
<p>to-day would not find a dozen recruits.</p>
<p>In still another chapter I have told you how the great religious</p>
<p>wars took place more than a century after the first open</p>
<p>act of the Reformation and if you will compare the chapter</p>
<p>on the Thirty Years War with that on Inventions, you will see</p>
<p>that this ghastly butchery took place at a time when the first</p>
<p>clumsy steam engines were already puffing in the laboratories</p>
<p>of a number of French and German and English scientists.</p>
<p>But the world at large took no interest in these strange</p>
<p>contraptions, and went on with a grand theological discussion</p>
<p>which to-day causes yawns, but no anger.</p>
<p>And so it goes. A thousand years from now, the historian</p>
<p>will use the same words about Europe of the out-going nine-</p>
<p>teenth century, and he will see how men were engaged upon</p>
<p>terrific nationalistic struggles while the laboratories all around</p>
<p>them were filled with serious folk who cared not one whit for</p>
<p>politics as long as they could force nature to surrender a few</p>
<p>more of her million secrets.</p>
<p>You will gradually begin to understand what I am driving</p>
<p>at. The engineer and the scientist and the chemist, within a</p>
<p>single generation, filled Europe and America and Asia with</p>
<p>their vast machines, with their telegraphs, their flying machines,</p>
<p>their coal-tar products. They created a new world in which</p>
<p>time and space were reduced to complete insignificance. They</p>
<p>invented new products and they made these so cheap that almost</p>
<p>every one could buy them. I have told you all this before</p>
<p>but it certainly will bear repeating.</p>
<p>To keep the ever increasing number of factories going, the</p>
<p>owners, who had also become the rulers of the land, needed raw</p>
<p>materials and coal. Especially coal. Meanwhile the mass of</p>
<p>the people were still thinking in terms of the sixteenth and</p>
<p>seventeenth centuries and clinging to the old notions of the</p>
<p>state as a dynastic or political organisation. This clumsy mediaeval</p>
<p>institution was then suddenly called upon to handle the</p>
<p>highly modern problems of a mechanical and industrial world.</p>
<p>It did its best, according to the rules of the game which had</p>
<p>been laid down centuries before. The different states created</p>
<p>enormous armies and gigantic navies which were used for the</p>
<p>purpose of acquiring new possessions in distant lands. Whereever{sic}</p>
<p>there was a tiny bit of land left, there arose an English or</p>
<p>a French or a German or a Russian colony. If the natives</p>
<p>objected, they were killed. In most cases they did not object,</p>
<p>and were allowed to live peacefully, provided they did not</p>
<p>interfere with the diamond mines or the coal mines or the oil</p>
<p>mines or the gold mines or the rubber plantations, and they</p>
<p>derived many benefits from the foreign occupation.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happened that two states in search of raw</p>
<p>materials wanted the same piece of land at the same time.</p>
<p>Then there was a war. This occurred fifteen years ago when</p>
<p>Russia and Japan fought for the possession of certain terri-</p>
<p>tories which belonged to the Chinese people. Such conflicts,</p>
<p>however, were the exception. No one really desired to fight.</p>
<p>Indeed, the idea of fighting with armies and battleships and</p>
<p>submarines began to seem absurd to the men of the early 20th</p>
<p>century. They associated the idea of violence with the long-</p>
<p>ago age of unlimited monarchies and intriguing dynasties.</p>
<p>Every day they read in their papers of still further inventions,</p>
<p>of groups of English and American and German scientists who</p>
<p>were working together in perfect friendship for the purpose</p>
<p>of an advance in medicine or in astronomy. They lived in a</p>
<p>busy world of trade and of commerce and factories. But only</p>
<p>a few noticed that the development of the state, (of the gigantic</p>
<p>community of people who recognise certain common ideals,)</p>
<p>was lagging several hundred years behind. They tried to warn</p>
<p>the others. But the others were occupied with their own</p>
<p>affairs.</p>
<p>I have used so many similes that I must apologise for bringing</p>
<p>in one more. The Ship of State (that old and trusted</p>
<p>expression which is ever new and always picturesque,) of the</p>
<p>Egyptians and the Greeks and the Romans and the Venetians</p>
<p>and the merchant adventurers of the seventeenth century had</p>
<p>been a sturdy craft, constructed of well-seasoned wood, and</p>
<p>commanded by officers who knew both their crew and their</p>
<p>vessel and who understood the limitations of the art of navigating</p>
<p>which had been handed down to them by their ancestors.</p>
<p>Then came the new age of iron and steel and machinery.</p>
<p>First one part, then another of the old ship of state was</p>
<p>changed. Her dimensions were increased. The sails were discarded</p>
<p>for steam. Better living quarters were established, but</p>
<p>more people were forced to go down into the stoke-hole, and</p>
<p>while the work was safe and fairly remunerative, they did not</p>
<p>like it as well as their old and more dangerous job in the</p>
<p>rigging. Finally, and almost imperceptibly, the old wooden</p>
<p>square-rigger had been transformed into a modern ocean liner.</p>
<p>But the captain and the mates remained the same. They were</p>
<p>appointed or elected in the same way as a hundred years before.</p>
<p>They were taught the same system of navigation which</p>
<p>had served the mariners of the fifteenth century. In their</p>
<p>cabins hung the same charts and signal flags which had done</p>
<p>service in the days of Louis XIV and Frederick the Great.</p>
<p>In short, they were (through no fault of their own) completely</p>
<p>incompetent.</p>
<p>The sea of international politics is not very broad. When</p>
<p>those Imperial and Colonial liners began to try and outrun</p>
<p>each other, accidents were bound to happen. They did happen.</p>
<p>You can still see the wreckage if you venture to pass</p>
<p>through that part of the ocean.</p>
<p>And the moral of the story is a simple one. The world is</p>
<p>in dreadful need of men who will assume the new leadership--</p>
<p>who will have the courage of their own visions and who will</p>
<p>recognise clearly that we are only at the beginning of the</p>
<p>voyage, and have to learn an entirely new system of seamanship.</p>
<p>They will have to serve for years as mere apprentices.</p>
<p>They will have to fight their way to the top against every possible</p>
<p>form of opposition. When they reach the bridge, mutiny</p>
<p>of an envious crew may cause their death. But some day, a</p>
<p>man will arise who will bring the vessel safely to port, and he</p>
<p>shall be the hero of the ages.</p>
<p>AS IT EVER SHALL BE</p>
<p>``The more I think of the problems of our lives, the more I am</p>
<p>``persuaded that we ought to choose Irony and Pity for our</p>
<p>``assessors and judges as the ancient Egyptians called upon</p>
<p>``the Goddess Isis and the Goddess Nephtys on behalf of their</p>
<p>``dead.</p>
<p>``Irony and Pity are both of good counsel; the first with her</p>
<p>``smiles makes life agreeable; the other sanctifies it with her</p>
<p>``tears.</p>
<p>``The Irony which I invoke is no cruel Deity. She mocks</p>
<p>``neither love nor beauty. She is gentle and kindly disposed.</p>
<p>``Her mirth disarms and it is she who teaches us to laugh at</p>
<p>``rogues and fools, whom but for her we might be so weak as</p>
<p>``to despise and hate.&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>And with these wise words of a very great Frenchman I</p>
<p>bid you farewell.</p>

<p>AN ANIMATED CHRONOLOGY,</p>
<p>500,000 B.C.--A.D. 1922</p>
<p>THE END</p>
<p>CONCERNING THE PICTURES</p>
<p>CONCERNING THE PICTURES OF THIS BOOK AND A FEW</p>
<p>WORDS ABOUT THE BIBLIOGRAPHY.</p>
<p>The day of the historical textbook without illustrations has gone.</p>
<p>Pictures and photographs of famous personages and equally famous</p>
<p>occurrences cover the pages of Breasted and Robinson and Beard. In</p>
<p>this volume the photographs have been omitted to make room for a</p>
<p>series of home-made drawings which represent ideas rather than events.</p>
<p>While the author lays no claim to great artistic excellence (being</p>
<p>possessed of a decided leaning towards drawing as a child, he was</p>
<p>taught to play the violin as a matter of discipline,) he prefers to</p>
<p>make his own maps and sketches because he knows exactly what he</p>
<p>wants to say and cannot possibly explain this meaning to his more</p>
<p>proficient brethren in the field of art. Besides, the pictures were all</p>
<p>drawn for children and their ideas of art are very different from those</p>
<p>of their parents.</p>
<p>To all teachers the author would give this advice--let your boys and</p>
<p>girls draw their history after their own desire just as often as you have</p>
<p>a chance. You can show a class a photograph of a Greek temple or a</p>
<p>mediaeval castle and the class will dutifully say, ``Yes, Ma&#x27;am,&#x27;&#x27; and</p>
<p>proceed to forget all about it. But make the Greek temple or the</p>
<p>Roman castle the centre of an event, tell the boys to make their own</p>
<p>picture of <code>the building of a temple,&#x27;&#x27; or </code>the storming of the castle,&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>and they will stay after school-hours to finish the job. Most children,</p>
<p>before they are taught how to draw from plaster casts, can draw after</p>
<p>a fashion, and often they can draw remarkably well. The product of</p>
<p>their pencil may look a bit prehistoric. It may even resemble the</p>
<p>work of certain native tribes from the upper Congo. But the child is</p>
<p>quite frequently prehistoric or upper-Congoish in his or her own tastes,</p>
<p>and expresses these primitive instincts with a most astonishing accuracy.</p>
<p>The main thing in teaching history, is that the pupil shall remember</p>
<p>certain events ``in their proper sequence.&#x27;&#x27; The experiments of</p>
<p>many years in the Children&#x27;s School of New York has convinced the</p>
<p>author that few children will ever forget what they have drawn, while</p>
<p>very few will ever remember what they have merely read.</p>
<p>It is the same with the maps. Give the child an ordinary conventional</p>
<p>map with dots and lines and green seas and tell him to revaluate</p>
<p>that geographic scene in his or her own terms. The mountains will be</p>
<p>a bit out of gear and the cities will look astonishingly mediaeval. The</p>
<p>outlines will be often very imperfect, but the general effect will be</p>
<p>quite as truthful as that of our conventional maps, which ever since</p>
<p>the days of good Gerardus Mercator have told a strangely erroneous</p>
<p>story. Most important of all, it will give the child a feeling of intimacy</p>
<p>with historical and geographic facts which cannot be obtained in any</p>
<p>other way.</p>
<p>Neither the publishers nor the author claim that ``The Story of Mankind&#x27;&#x27;</p>
<p>is the last word to be said upon the subject of history for children.</p>
<p>It is an appetizer. The book tries to present the subject in such</p>
<p>a fashion that the average child shall get a taste for History and shall</p>
<p>ask for more.</p>
<p>To facilitate the work of both parents and teachers, the publishers</p>
<p>have asked Miss Leonore St. John Power (who knows more upon this</p>
<p>particular subject than any one else they could discover) to compile a</p>
<p>list of readable and instructive books.</p>
<p>The list was made and was duly printed.</p>
<p>The parents who live near our big cities will experience no difficulty</p>
<p>in ordering these volumes from their booksellers. Those who</p>
<p>for the sake of fresh air and quiet, dwell in more remote spots, may</p>
<p>not find it convenient to go to a book-store. In that case, Boni and</p>
<p>Liveright will be happy to act as middle-man and obtain the books</p>
<p>that are desired. They want it to be distinctly understood that</p>
<p>they have not gone into the retail book business, but they are quite</p>
<p>willing to do their share towards a better and more general historical</p>
<p>education, and all orders will receive their immediate attention.</p>

<p>``legitimate daughter of Zeus and, as such, had the privilege to draw</p>

<p>``on reading, as well as you can, and be sure that when the children</p>
<p>``get the thrill of the story, for which you wait, they will be asking</p>
<p>``more questions, and pertinent ones, than you are able to answer.--</p>
