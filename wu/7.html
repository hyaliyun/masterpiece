&quot;AFTER DARK.&quot; I HAVE taken some pains to string together the various stories contained in this Volume on a single thread of interest, which, so far as I know, has at least the merit of not having been used before. The pages entitled &quot;Leah&#x27;s Diary&quot; are, however, intended to fulfill another purpose besides that of serving as the frame-work for my collection of tales. In this part of the book, and subsequently in the Prologues to the stories, it has been my object to give the reader one more glimpse at that artist-life which circumstances have afforded me peculiar opportunities of studying, and which I have already tried to represent, under another aspect, in my fiction, &quot;Hide-and-Seek.&quot;  This time I wish to ask some sympathy for the joys and sorrows of a poor traveling portrait-painter--presented from his wife&#x27;s point of view in &quot;Leah&#x27;s Diary,&quot; and supposed to be briefly and simply narrated by himself in the Prologues to the stories. I have purposely kept these two portions of the book within certain limits; only giving, in the one case, as much as the wife might naturally write in her diary at intervals of household leisure; and, in the other, as much as a modest and sensible man would be likely to say about himself and about the characters he met with in his wanderings. If I have been so fortunate as to make my idea intelligible by this brief and simple mode of treatment, and if I have, at the same time, achieved the necessary object of gathering several separate stories together as neatly-fitting parts of one complete whole, I shall have succeeded in a design which I have for some time past been very anxious creditably to fulfill. Of the tales themselves, taken individually, I have only to say, by way of necessary explanation, that &quot;The Lady of Glenwith Grange&quot; is now offered to the reader for the first time; and that the other stories have appeared in the columns of _Household Words_. My best thanks are due to Mr. Charles Dickens for his kindness in allowing me to set them in their present frame-work. I must also gratefully acknowledge an obligation of another kind to the accomplished artist, Mr. W. S. Herrick, to whom I am indebted for the curious and interesting facts on which the tales of &quot;The Terribly Strange Bed&quot; and &quot;The Yellow Mask&quot; are founded. Although the statement may appear somewhat superfluous to those who know me, it may not be out of place to add, in conclusion, that these stories are entirely of my own imagining, constructing, and writing. The fact that the events of some of my tales occur on foreign ground, and are acted out by foreign personages, appears to have suggested in some quarters the inference that the stories themselves might be of foreign origin. Let me, once for all, assure any readers who may honor me with their attention, that in this, and in all other cases, they may depend on the genuineness of my literary offspring. The little children of my brain may be weakly enough, and may be sadly in want of a helping hand to aid them in their first attempts at walking on the stage of this great world; but, at any rate, they are not borrowed children. The members of my own literary family are indeed increasing so fast as to render the very idea of borrowing quite out of the question, and to suggest serious apprehension that I may not have done adding to the large book-population, on my own sole responsibility, even yet. AFTER DARK. LEAVES FROM LEAH&#x27;S DIARY. 26th February, 1827.--The doctor has just called for the third time to examine my husband&#x27;s eyes. Thank God, there is no fear at present of my poor William losing his sight, provided he can be prevailed on to attend rigidly to the medical instructions for preserving it. These instructions, which forbid him to exercise his profession for the next six months at least, are, in our case, very hard to follow. They will but too probably sentence us to poverty, perhaps to actual want; but they must be borne resignedly, and even thankfully, seeing that my husband&#x27;s forced cessation from work will save him from the dreadful affliction of loss of sight. I think I can answer for my own cheerfulness and endurance, now that we know the worst. Can I answer for our children also? Surely I can, when there are only two of them. It is a sad confession to make, but now, for the first time since my marriage, I feel thankful that we have no more. 17th.--A dread came over me last night, after I had comforted William as well as I could about the future, and had heard him fall off to sleep, that the doctor had not told us the worst. Medical men do sometimes deceive their patients, from what has always seemed to me to be misdirected kindness of heart. The mere suspicion that I had been trifled with on the subject of my husband&#x27;s illness, caused me such uneasiness, that I made an excuse to get out, and went in secret to the doctor. Fortunately, I found him at home, and in three words I confessed to him the object of my visit. He smiled, and said I might make myself easy; he had told us the worst. &quot;And that worst,&quot; I said, to make certain, &quot;is, that for the next six months my husband must allow his eyes to have the most perfect repose?&quot; &quot;Exactly,&quot; the doctor answered. &quot;Mind, I don&#x27;t say that he may not dispense with his green shade, indoors, for an hour or two at a time, as the inflammation gets subdued. But I do most positively repeat that he must not _employ_ his eyes. He must not touch a brush or pencil; he must not think of taking another likeness, on any consideration whatever, for the next six months. His persisting in finishing those two portraits, at the time when his eyes first began to fail, was the real cause of all the bad symptoms that we have had to combat ever since. I warned him (if you remember, Mrs. Kerby?) when he first came to practice in our neighborhood.&quot; &quot;I know you did, sir,&quot; I replied. &quot;But what was a poor traveling portrait-painter like my husband, who lives by taking likenesses first in one place and then in another, to do? Our bread depended on his using his eyes, at the very time when you warned him to let them have a rest.&quot; &quot;Have you no other resources? No money but the money Mr. Kerby can get by portrait-painting?&quot; asked the doctor. &quot;None,&quot; I answered, with a sinking at my heart as I thought of his bill for medical attendance. &quot;Will you pardon me?&quot; he said, coloring and looking a little uneasy, &quot;or, rather, will you ascribe it to the friendly interest I feel in you, if I ask whether Mr. Kerby realizes a comfortable income by the practice of his profession? Don&#x27;t,&quot; he went on anxiously, before I could reply--&quot;pray don&#x27;t think I make this inquiry from a motive of impertinent curiosity!&quot; I felt quite satisfied that he could have no improper motive for asking the question, and so answered it at once plainly and truly. &quot;My husband makes but a small income,&quot; I said. &quot;Famous London portrait-painters get great prices from their sitters; but poor unknown artists, who only travel about the country, are obliged to work hard and be contented with very small gains. After we have paid all that we owe here, I am afraid we shall have little enough left to retire on, when we take refuge in some cheaper place.&quot; &quot;In that case,&quot; said. the good doctor (I am so glad and proud to remember that I always liked him from the first!), &quot;in that case, don&#x27;t make yourself anxious about my bill when you are thinking of clearing off your debts here. I can afford to wait till Mr. Kerby&#x27;s eyes are well again, and I shall then ask him for a likeness of my little daughter. By that arrangement we are sure to be both quits, and both perfectly satisfied.&quot; He considerately shook hands and bade me farewell before I could say half the grateful words to him that were on my lips. Never, never shall I forget that he relieved me of my two heaviest anxieties at the most anxious time of my life. The merciful, warm-hearted man! I could almost have knelt down and kissed his doorstep, as I crossed it on my way home. 18th.--If I had not res olved, after what happened yesterday, to look only at the cheerful side of things for the future, the events of today would have robbed me of all my courage, at the very outset of our troubles. First, there was the casting up of our bills, and the discovery, when the amount of them was balanced against all the money we have saved up, that we shall only have between three and four pounds left in the cash-box, after we have got out of debt. Then there was the sad necessity of writing letters in my husband&#x27;s name to the rich people who were ready to employ him, telling them of the affliction that had overtaken him, and of the impossibility of his executing their orders for portraits for the next six months to come. And, lastly, there was the heart-breaking business for me to go through of giving our landlord warning, just as we had got comfortably settled in our new abode. If William could only have gone on with his work, we might have stopped in this town, and in these clean, comfortable lodgings for at least three or four months. We have never had the use of a nice empty garret before, for the children to play in; and I never met with any landlady so pleasant to deal with in the kitchen as the landlady here. And now we must leave all this comfort and happiness, and go--I hardly know where. William, in his bitterness, says to the workhouse; but that shall never be, if I have to go out to service to prevent it. The darkness is coming on, and we must save in candles, or I could write much more. Ah, me! what a day this has been. I have had but one pleasant moment since it began; and that was in the morning, when I set my little Emily to work on a bead purse for the kind doctor&#x27;s daughter. My child, young as she is, is wonderfully neat-handed at stringing beads; and even a poor little empty purse as a token of our gratitude, is better than nothing at all. 19th.--A visit from our best friend--our only friend here--the doctor. After he had examined William&#x27;s eyes, and had reported that they were getting on as well as can be hoped at present, he asked where we thought of going to live? I said in the cheapest place we could find, and added that I was about to make inquiries in the by-streets of the town that very day. &quot;Put off those inquiries,&quot; he said, &quot;till you hear from me again. I am going now to see a patient at a farmhouse five miles off. (You needn&#x27;t look at the children, Mrs. Kerby, it&#x27;s nothing infectious--only a clumsy lad, who has broken his collarbone by a fall from a horse.) They receive lodgers occasionally at the farmhouse, and I know no reason why they should not be willing to receive you. If you want to be well housed and well fed at a cheap rate, and if you like the society of honest, hearty people, the farm of Appletreewick is the very place for you. Don&#x27;t thank me till you know whether I can get you these new lodgings or not. And in the meantime settle all your business affairs here, so as to be able to move at a moment&#x27;s notice.&quot; With those words the kind-hearted gentleman nodded and went out. Pray heaven he may succeed at the farmhouse! We may be sure of the children&#x27;s health, at least, if we live in the country. Talking of the children, I must not omit to record that Emily has nearly done one end of the bead purse already. 20th.--A note from the doctor, who is too busy to call. Such good news! They will give us two bedrooms, and board us with the family at Appletreewick for seventeen shillings a week. By my calculations, we shall have three pounds sixteen shillings left, after paying what we owe here. That will be enough, at the outset, for four weeks&#x27; living at the farmhouse, with eight shillings to spare besides. By embroidery-work I can easily make nine shillings more to put to that, and there is a fifth week provided for. Surely, in five weeks&#x27; time--considering the number of things I can turn my hand to--we may hit on some plan for getting a little money. This is what I am always telling my husband, and what, by dint of constantly repeating it, I am getting to believe myself. William, as is but natural, poor fellow, does not take so lighthearted view of the future as I do. He says that the prospect of sitting idle and being kept by his wife for months to come, is something more wretched and hopeless than words can describe. I try to raise his spirits by reminding him of his years of honest hard work for me and the children, and of the doctor&#x27;s assurance that his eyes will get the better, in good time, of their present helpless state. But he still sighs and murmurs--being one of the most independent and high spirited of men--about living a burden on his wife. I can only answer, what in my heart of hearts I feel, that I took him for Better and for Worse; that I have had many years of the Better, and that, even in our present trouble, the Worse shows no signs of coming yet! The bead purse is getting on fast. Red and blue, in a pretty striped pattern. 21st.--A busy day. We go to Appletreewick to-morrow. Paying bills and packing up. All poor William&#x27;s new canvases and painting-things huddled together into a packing-case. He looked so sad, sitting silent with his green shade on, while his old familiar working materials were disappearing around him, as if he and they were never to come together again, that the tears would start into my eyes, though I am sure I am not one of the crying sort. Luckily, the green shade kept him from seeing me: and I took good care, though the effort nearly choked me, that he should not hear I was crying, at any rate. The bead purse is done. How are we to get the steel rings and tassels for it? I am not justified now in spending sixpence unnecessarily, even for the best of purposes. 22d.----- 23d. _The Farm of Appletreewick._--Too tired, after our move yesterday, to write a word in my diary about our journey to this delightful place. But now that we are beginning to get settled, I can manage to make up for past omissions. My first occupation on the morning of the move had, oddly enough, nothing to do with our departure for the farmhouse. The moment breakfast was over I began the day by making Emily as smart and nice-looking as I could, to go to the doctor&#x27;s with the purse. She had her best silk frock on, showing the mending a little in some places, I am afraid, and her straw hat trimmed with my bonnet ribbon. Her father&#x27;s neck-scarf, turned and joined so that nobody could see it, made a nice mantilla for her; and away she went to the doctor&#x27;s, with her little, determined step, and the purse in her hand (such a pretty hand that it is hardly to be regretted I had no gloves for her). They were delighted with the purse--which I ought to mention was finished with some white beads; we found them in rummaging among our boxes, and they made beautiful rings and tassels, contrasting charmingly with the blue and red of the rest of the purse. The doctor and his little girl were, as I have said, delighted with the present; and they gave Emily, in return, a workbox for herself, and a box of sugar-plums for her baby sister. The child came back all flushed with the pleasure of the visit, and quite helped to keep up her father&#x27;s spirits with talking to him about it. So much for the highly interesting history of the bead purse. Toward the afternoon the light cart from the farmhouse came to fetch us and our things to Appletreewick. It was quite a warm spring day, and I had another pang to bear as I saw poor William helped into the cart, looking so sickly and sad, with his miserable green shade, in the cheerful sunlight. &quot;God only knows, Leah, how this will succeed with us,&quot; he said, as we started; then sighed, and fell silent again. Just outside the town the doctor met us. &quot;Good luck go with you!&quot; he cried, swinging his stick in his usual hasty way; &quot;I shall come and see you as soon as you are all settled at the farmhouse.&quot;  &quot;Good-by, sir,&quot; says Emily, struggling up with all her might among the bundles in the bottom of the cart; &quot;good-by, and thank you again for the work-box and the sugar-plums.&quot; That was my child all over! she never wants telling. The doctor kissed his hand, and gave another flourish with  his stick. So we parted. How I should have enjoyed the drive if William could only have looked, as I did, at the young firs on the heath bending beneath the steady breeze; at the shadows flying over the smooth fields; at the high white clouds moving on and on, in their grand airy procession over the gladsome blue sky! It was a hilly road, and I begged the lad who drove us not to press the horse; so we were nearly an hour, at our slow rate of going, before we drew up at the gate of Appletreewick. 24th February to 2d March.--We have now been here long enough to know something of the place and the people. First, as to the place: Where the farmhouse now is, there was once a famous priory. The tower in still standing, and the great room where the monks ate and drank--used at present as a granary. The house itself seems to have been tacked on to the ruins anyhow. No two rooms in it are on the same level. The children do nothing but tumble about the passages, because there always happens to be a step up or down, just at the darkest part of every one of them. As for staircases, there seems to me to be one for each bedroom. I do nothing but lose my way--and the farmer says, drolling, that he must have sign-posts put up for me in every corner of the house from top to bottom. On the ground-floor, besides the usual domestic offices, we have the best parlor--a dark, airless, expensively furnished solitude, never invaded by anybody; the kitchen, and a kind of hall, with a fireplace as big as the drawing-room at our town lodgings. Here we live and take our meals; here the children can racket about to their hearts&#x27; content; here the dogs come lumbering in, whenever they can get loose; here wages are paid, visitors are received, bacon is cured, cheese is tasted, pipes are smoked, and naps are taken every evening by the male members of the family. Never was such a comfortable, friendly dwelling-place devised as this hall; I feel already as if half my life had been passed in it. Out-of-doors, looking beyond the flower-garden, lawn, back yards, pigeon-houses, and kitchen-gardens, we are surrounded by a network of smooth grazing-fields, each shut off from the other by its neat hedgerow and its sturdy gate. Beyond the fields the hills seem to flow away gently from us into the far blue distance, till they are lost in the bright softness of the sky. At one point, which we can see from our bedroom windows, they dip suddenly into the plain, and show, over the rich marshy flat, a strip of distant sea--a strip sometimes blue, sometimes gray; sometimes, when the sun sets, a streak of fire; sometimes, on showery days, a flash of silver light. The inhabitants of the farmhouse have one great and rare merit--they are people whom you can make friends with at once. Between not knowing them at all, and knowing them well enough to shake hands at first sight, there is no ceremonious interval or formal gradation whatever. They received us, on our arrival, exactly as if we were old friends returned from some long traveling expedition. Before we had been ten minutes in the hall, William had the easiest chair and the snuggest corner; the children were eating bread-and-jam on the window-seat; and I was talking to the farmer&#x27;s wife, with the cat on my lap, of the time when Emily had the measles. The family numbers seven, exclusive of the indoor servants, of course. First came the farmer and his wife--he is a tall, sturdy, loud-voiced, active old man--she the easiest, plumpest and gayest woman of sixty I ever met with. They have three sons and two daughters. The two eldest of the young men are employed on the farm; the third is a sailor, and is making holiday-time of it just now at Appletreewick. The daughters are pictures of health and freshness. I have but one complaint to make against them--they are beginning to spoil the children already. In this tranquil place, and among these genial, natural people, how happily my time might be passed, were it not for the saddening sight of William&#x27;s affliction, and the wearing uncertainty of how we are to provide for future necessities! It is a hard thing for my husband and me, after having had the day made pleasant by kind words and friendly offices, to feel this one anxious thought always forcing itself on us at night: Shall we have the means of stopping in our new home in a month&#x27;s time? 3d.--A rainy day; the children difficult to manage; William miserably despondent. Perhaps he influenced me, or perhaps I felt my little troubles with the children more than usual: but, however it was, I have not been so heavy-hearted since the day when my husband first put on the green shade. A listless, hopeless sensation would steal over me; but why write about it? Better to try and forget it. There is always to-morrow to look to when to-day is at the worst. 4th.--To-morow_ has proved worthy of the faith I put in it. Sunshine again out-of-doors; and as clear and true a reflection of it in my own heart as I can hope to have just at this time. Oh! that month, that one poor month of respite! What are we to do at the end of the month ? 5th.--I made my short entry for yesterday in the afternoon just before tea-time, little thinking of events destined to happen with the evening that would be really worth chronicling, for the sake of the excellent results to which they are sure to lead. My tendency is to be too sanguine about everything, I know; but I am, nevertheless, firmly persuaded that I can see a new way out of our present difficulties--a way of getting money enough to keep us all in comfort at the farmhouse until William&#x27;s eyes are well again. The new project which is to relieve us from all uncertainties for the next six months actually originated with _me!_ It has raised me many inches higher in my own estimation already. If the doctor only agrees with my view of the case when he comes to-morrow, William will allow himself to be persuaded, I know; and then let them say what they please, I will answer for the rest. This is how the new idea first found its way into my head: We had just done tea. William, in much better spirits than usual, was talking with the young sailor, who is jocosely called here by the very ugly name of &quot;Foul-weather Dick.&quot; The farmer and his two eldest sons were composing themselves on the oaken settles for their usual nap. The dame was knitting, the two girls were beginning to clear the tea-table, and I was darning the children&#x27;s socks. To all appearance, this was not a very propitious state of things for the creation of new ideas, and yet my idea grew out of it, for all that. Talking with my husband on various subjects connected with life in ships, the young sailor began giving us a description of his hammock; telling us how it was slung; how it was impossible to get into it any other way than &quot;stern foremost&quot; (whatever that may mean); how the rolling of the ship made it rock like a cradle; and how, on rough nights, it sometimes swayed to and fro at such a rate as to bump bodily against the ship&#x27;s side and wake him up with the sensation of having just received a punch on the head from a remarkably hard fist. Hearing all this, I ventured to suggest that it must be an immense relief to him to sleep on shore in a good, motionless, solid four-post bed. But, to my surprise, he scoffed at the idea; said he never slept comfortably out of his hammock; declared that he quite missed his occasional punch on the head from the ship&#x27;s side; and ended by giving a most comical account of all the uncomfortable sensations he felt when he slept in a four-post bed. The odd nature of one of the young sailor&#x27;s objections to sleeping on shore reminded my husband (as indeed it did me too) of the terrible story of a bed in a French gambling-house, which he once heard from a gentleman whose likeness he took. &quot;You&#x27;re laughing at me,&quot; says honest Foul-weather Dick, seeing William turn toward me and smile.--&quot;No, indeed,&quot; says my husband; &quot;that last objection of yours to the four-post beds on shore seems by no means ridiculous to _me,_ at any rate. I once knew a gentleman, Dick, who practically realized your objection.&quot; &quot;Excuse me, sir,&quot; says Dick, after a pause, and with an appearance of great bewilderment and curiosity; &quot;but could you put &#x27;practically realized&#x27; into plain English, so that a poor man like me might have a chance of understanding you?&quot;--&quot;Certainly!&quot; says my husband, laughing. &quot;I mean that I once knew a gentleman who actually saw and felt what you say in jest you are afraid of seeing and feeling whenever you sleep in a four-post bed. Do you understand that?&quot; Foul-weather Dick understood it perfectly, and begged with great eagerness to hear what the gentleman&#x27;s adventure really was. The dame, who had been listening to our talk, backed her son&#x27;s petition; the two girls sat down expectant at the half-cleared tea-table; even the farmer and his drowsy sons roused themselves lazily on the settle--my husband saw that he stood fairly committed to the relation of the story, so he told it without more ado. I have often heard him relate that strange adventure (William is the best teller of a story I ever met with) to friends of all ranks in many different parts of England, and I never yet knew it fail of producing an effect. The farmhouse audience were, I may almost say, petrified by it. I never before saw people look so long in the same direction, and sit so long in the same attitude, as they did. Even the servants stole away from their work in the kitchen, and, unrebuked by master or mistress, stood quite spell-bound in the doorway to listen. Observing all this in silence, while my husband was going on with his narrative, the thought suddenly flashed across me, &quot;Why should William not get a wider audience for that story, as well as for others which he has heard from time to time from his sitters, and which he has hitherto only repeated in private among a few friends? People tell stories in books and get money for them. What if we told our stories in a book? and what if the book sold? Why freedom, surely, from the one great anxiety that is now preying on us! Money enough to stop at the farmhouse till William&#x27;s eyes are fit for work again!&quot; I almost jumped up from my chair as my thought went on shaping itself in this manner. When great men make wonderful discoveries, do they feel sensations like mine, I wonder? Was Sir Isaac Newton within an ace of skipping into the air when he first found out the law of gravitation? Did Friar Bacon long to dance when he lit the match and heard the first charge of gunpowder in the world go off with a bang? I had to put a strong constraint on myself, or I should have communicated all that was passing in my mind to William before our friends at the farmhouse. But I knew it was best to wait until we were alone, and I did wait. What a relief it was when we all got up at last to say good-night! The moment we were in our own room, I could not stop to take so much as a pin out of my dress before I began. &quot;My dear,&quot; said I, &quot;I never heard you tell that gambling-house adventure so well before. What an effect it had upon our friends! what an effect, indeed, it always has wherever you tell it!&quot; So far he did not seem to take much notice. He just nodded, and began to pour out some of the lotion in which he always bathes his poor eyes the last thing at night. &quot;And as for that, William,&quot; I went on, &quot;all your stories seem to interest people. What a number you have picked up, first and last, from different sitters, in the fifteen years of your practice as a portrait-painter! Have you any idea how many stories you really do know?&quot; No: he could not undertake to say how many just then. He gave this answer in a very indifferent tone, dabbing away all the time at his eyes with the sponge and lotion. He did it so awkwardly and roughly, as it seemed to me, that I took the sponge from him and applied the lotion tenderly myself. &quot;Do you think,&quot; said I, &quot;if you turned over one of your stories carefully in your mind beforehand--say the one you told to-night, for example--that you could repeat it all to me so perfectly and deliberately that I should be able to take it down in writing from your lips?&quot; Yes: of course he could. But why ask that question? &quot;Because I should like to have all the stories that you have been in the habit of relating to our friends set down fairly in writing, by way of preserving them from ever being forgotten.&quot; Would I bathe his left eye now, because that felt the hottest tonight? I began to forbode that his growing indifference to what I was saying would soon end in his fairly going to sleep before I had developed my new idea, unless I took some means forthwith of stimulating his curiosity, or, in other words, of waking him into a proper state of astonishment and attention. &quot;William,&quot; said I, without another syllable of preface, &quot;I have got a new plan for finding all the money we want for our expenses here.&quot; He jerked his head up directly, and looked at me. What plan? &quot;This: The state of your eyes prevents you for the present from following your profession as an artist, does it not? Very well. What are you to do with your idle time, my dear? Turn author! And how are you to get the money we want? By publishing a book!&quot; &quot;Good gracious, Leah! are you out of your senses?&quot; he exclaimed. I put my arm round his neck and sat down on his knee (the course I always take when I want to persuade him to anything with as few words as possible). &quot;Now, William, listen patiently to me,&quot; I said. &quot;An artist lies under this great disadvantage in case of accidents--his talents are of no service to him unless he can use his eyes and fingers. An author, on the other hand, can turn his talents to account just as well by means of other people&#x27;s eyes and fingers as by means of his own. In your present situation, therefore, you have nothing for it, as I said before, but to turn author. Wait! and hear me out. The book I want you to make is a book of all your stories. You shall repeat them, and I will write them down from your dictation. Our manuscript shall be printed; we will sell the book to the public, and so support ourselves honorably in adversity, by doing the best we can to interest and amuse others.&quot; While I was saying all this--I suppose in a very excitable manner--my husband looked, as our young sailor-friend would phrase it, quite _taken aback._ &quot;You were always quick at contriving, Leah,&quot; he said; &quot;but how in the world came you to think of this plan?&quot; &quot;I thought of it while you were telling them the gambling-house adventure downstairs,&quot; I answered. &quot;It is an ingenious idea, and a bold idea,&quot; he went on, thoughtfully. &quot;But it is one thing to tell a story to a circle of friends, and another thing to put it into a printed form for an audience of strangers. Consider, my dear, that we are neither of us used to what is called writing for the press.&quot; &quot;Very true,&quot; said I, &quot;but nobody is used to it when they first begin, and yet plenty of people have tried the hazardous literary experiment successfully. Besides, in our case, we have the materials ready to our hands; surely we can succeed in shaping them presentably if we aim at nothing but the simple truth &quot; &quot;Who is to do the eloquent descriptions and the striking reflections, and all that part of it?&quot; said William, perplexedly shaking his head. &quot;Nobody!&quot; I replied. &quot;The eloquent descriptions and the striking reflections are just the parts of a story-book that people never read. Whatever we do, let us not, if we can possibly help it, write so much as a single sentence that can be conveniently skipped. Come! come!&quot; I continued, seeing him begin to shake his head again; &quot;no more objections, William, I am too certain of the success of my plan to endure them. If you still doubt, let us refer the new project to a competent arbitrator. The doctor is coming to see you to-morrow. I will tell him all that I have told you; and if you will promise on your side, I will engage on mine to be guided entirely by his opinion.&quot; William smiled, and readily gave the promise. This was all I wanted to send me to bed in the best spirits. For, of course, I should never have thought of mentioning the doctor as an arbitrator, if I had not known beforehand that he was sure to be on my side. 6th.--The arbitrator has sho wn that he deserved my confidence in him. He ranked himself entirely on my side before I had half done explaining to him what my new project really was. As to my husband&#x27;s doubts and difficulties, the dear good man would not so much as hear them mentioned. &quot;No objections,&quot; he cried, gayly; &quot;set to work, Mr. Kerby, and make your fortune. I always said your wife was worth her weight in gold--and here she is now, all ready to get into the bookseller&#x27;s scales and prove it. Set to work! set to work!&quot; &quot;With all my heart,&quot; said William, beginning at last to catch the infection of our enthusiasm. &quot;But when my part of the work and my wife&#x27;s has been completed, what are we to do with the produce of our labor?&quot; &quot;Leave that to me,&quot; answered the doctor. &quot;Finish your books and send it to my house; I will show it at once to the editor of our country newspaper. He has plenty of literary friends in London, and he will be just the man to help you. By-the-by,&quot; added the doctor, addressing me, &quot;you think of everything, Mrs. Kerby; pray have you thought of a name yet for the new book?&quot; At that question it was my turn to be &quot;taken aback.&quot; The idea of naming the book had never once entered my head. &quot;A good title is of vast importance,&quot; said the doctor, knitting his brows thoughtfully. &quot;We must all think about that. What shall it be? eh, Mrs. Kerby, what shall it be?&quot; &quot;Perhaps something may strike us after we have fairly set to work,&quot; my husband suggested. &quot;Talking of work,&quot; he continued, turning to me, &quot;how are you to find time, Leah, with your nursery occupations, for writing down all the stories as I tell them?&quot; &quot;I have been thinking of that this morning,&quot; said I, &quot;and have come to the conclusion that I shall have but little leisure to write from your dictation in the day-time. What with dressing and washing the children, teaching them, giving them their meals, taking them out to walk, and keeping them amused at home--to say nothing of sitting sociably at work with the dame and her two girls in the afternoon--I am afraid I shall have few opportunities of doing my part of the book between breakfast and tea-time. But when the children are in bed, and the farmer and his family are reading or dozing, I should have at least three unoccupied hours to spare. So, if you don&#x27;t mind putting off our working-time till after dark--&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s the title!&quot; shouted the doctor, jumping out of his chair as if he had been shot. &quot;Where?&quot; cried I, looking all round me in the surprise of the moment, as if I had expected to see the title magically inscribed for us on the walls of the room. &quot;In your last words, to be sure!&quot; rejoined the doctor. &quot;You said just now that you would not have leisure to write from Mr. Kerby&#x27;s dictation till _after dark._ What can we do better than name the book after the time when the book is written? Call it boldly, _After dark._ Stop! before anybody says a word for or against it, let us see how the name looks on paper.&quot; I opened my writing-desk in a great flutter. The doctor selected the largest sheet of paper and the broadest-nibbed pen he could find, and wrote in majestic round-text letters, with alternate thin and thick strokes beautiful to see, the two cabalistic words AFTER DARK. We all three laid our heads together over the paper, and in breathless silence studied the effect of the round-text: William raising his green shade in the excitement of the moment, and actually disobeying the doctor&#x27;s orders about not using his eyes, in the doctor&#x27;s own presence! After a good long stare, we looked round solemnly in each other&#x27;s faces and nodded. There was no doubt whatever on the subject after seeing the round-text. In one happy moment the doctor had hit on the right name. &quot;I have written the title-page,&quot; said our good friend, taking up his hat to go. &quot;And now I leave it to you two to write the book.&quot; Since then I have mended four pens and bought a quire of letter-paper at the village shop. William is to ponder well over his stories in the daytime, so as to be quite ready for me &quot;after dark.&quot; We are to commence our new occupation this evening. My heart beats fast and my eyes moisten when I think of it. How many of our dearest interests depend upon the one little beginning that we are to make to-night! PROLOGUE TO THE FIRST STORY. BEFORE I begin, by the aid of my wife&#x27;s patient attention and ready pen, to relate any of the stories which I have heard at various times from persons whose likenesses I have been employed to take, it will not be amiss if I try to secure the reader&#x27;s interest in the following pages, by briefly explaining how I became possessed of the narrative matter which they contain. Of myself I have nothing to say, but that I have followed the profession of a traveling portrait-painter for the last fifteen years. The pursuit of my calling has not only led me all through England, but has taken me twice to Scotland, and once to Ireland. In moving from district to district, I am never guided beforehand by any settled plan. Sometimes the letters of recommendation which I get from persons who are satisfied with the work I have done for them determine the direction in which I travel. Sometimes I hear of a new neighborhood in which there is no resident artist of ability, and remove thither on speculation. Sometimes my friends among the picture-dealers say a good word on my behalf to their rich customers, and so pave the way for me in the large towns. Sometimes my prosperous and famous brother-artists, hearing of small commissions which it is not worth their while to accept, mention my name, and procure me introductions to pleasant country houses. Thus I get on, now in one way and now in another, not winning a reputation or making a fortune, but happier, perhaps, on the whole, than many men who have got both the one and the other. So, at least, I try to think now, though I started in my youth with as high an ambition as the best of them. Thank God, it is not my business here to speak of past times and their disappointments. A twinge of the old hopeless heartache comes over me sometimes still, when I think of my student days. One peculiarity of my present way of life is, that it brings me into contact with all sorts of characters. I almost feel, by this time, as if I had painted every civilized variety of the human race. Upon the whole, my experience of the world, rough as it has been, has not taught me to think unkindly of my fellow-creatures. I have certainly received such treatment at the hands of some of my sitters as I could not describe without saddening and shocking any kind-hearted reader; but, taking one year and one place with another, I have cause to remember with gratitude and respect--sometimes even with friendship and affection--a very large proportion of the numerous persons who have employed me. Some of the results of my experience are curious in a moral point of view. For example, I have found women almost uniformly less delicate in asking me about my terms, and less generous in remunerating me for my services, than men. On the other hand, men, within my knowledge, are decidedly vainer of their personal attractions, and more vexatiously anxious to have them done full justice to on canvas, than women. Taking both sexes together, I have found young people, for the most part, more gentle, more reasonable, and more considerate than old. And, summing up, in a general way, my experience of different ranks (which extends, let me premise, all the way down from peers to publicans), I have met with most of my formal and ungracious receptions among rich people of uncertain social standing: the highest classes and the lowest among my employers almost always contrive--in widely different ways, of course, to make me feel at home as soon as I enter their houses. The one great obstacle that I have to contend against in the practice of my profession is not, as some persons may imagine, the difficulty of making my sitters keep their heads still while I paint them, but the difficulty of getting them to preserve the natural look and the every-day peculiarities of dress and manner. People will assume an expressio n, will brush up their hair, will correct any little characteristic carelessness in their apparel--will, in short, when they want to have their likenesses taken, look as if they were sitting for their pictures. If I paint them, under these artificial circumstances, I fail of course to present them in their habitual aspect; and my portrait, as a necessary consequence, disappoints everybody, the sitter always included. When we wish to judge of a man&#x27;s character by his handwriting, we want his customary scrawl dashed off with his common workaday pen, not his best small-text, traced laboriously with the finest procurable crow-quill point. So it is with portrait-painting, which is, after all, nothing but a right reading of the externals of character recognizably presented to the view of others. Experience, after repeated trials, has proved to me that the only way of getting sitters who persist in assuming a set look to resume their habitual expression, is to lead them into talking about some subject in which they are greatly interested. If I can only beguile them into speaking earnestly, no matter on what topic, I am sure of recovering their natural expression; sure of seeing all the little precious everyday peculiarities of the man or woman peep out, one after another, quite unawares. The long, maundering stories about nothing, the wearisome recitals of petty grievances, the local anecdotes unrelieved by the faintest suspicion of anything like general interest, which I have been condemned to hear, as a consequence of thawing the ice off the features of formal sitters by the method just described, would fill hundreds of volumes, and promote the repose of thousands of readers. On the other hand, if I have suffered under the tediousness of the many, I have not been without my compensating gains from the wisdom and experience of the few. To some of my sitters I have been indebted for information which has enlarged my mind--to some for advice which has lightened my heart--to some for narratives of strange adventure which riveted my attention at the time, which have served to interest and amuse my fireside circle for many years past, and which are now, I would fain hope, destined to make kind friends for me among a wider audience than any that I have yet addressed. Singularly enough, almost all the best stories that I have heard from my sitters have been told by accident. I only remember two cases in which a story was volunteered to me, and, although I have often tried the experiment, I cannot call to mind even a single instance in which leading questions (as the lawyers call them) on my part, addressed to a sitter, ever produced any result worth recording. Over and over again, I have been disastrously successful in encouraging dull people to weary me. But the clever people who have something interesting to say, seem, so far as I have observed them, to acknowledge no other stimulant than chance. For every story which I propose including in the present collection, excepting one, I have been indebted, in the first instance, to the capricious influence of the same chance. Something my sitter  has seen about me, something I have remarked in my sitter, or in the room in which I take the likeness, or in the neighborhood through which I pass on my way to work, has suggested the necessary association, or has started the right train of recollections, and then the story appeared to begin of its own accord. Occasionally the most casual notice, on my part, of some very unpromising object has smoothed the way for the relation of a long and interesting narrative. I first heard one of the most dramatic of the stories that will be presented in this book, merely through being carelessly inquisitive to know the history of a stuffed poodle-dog. It is thus not without reason that I lay some stress on the desirableness of prefacing each one of the following narratives by a brief account of the curious manner in which I became possessed of it. As to my capacity for repeating these stories correctly, I can answer for it that my memory may be trusted. I may claim it as a merit, because it is after all a mechanical one, that I forget nothing, and that I can call long-passed conversations and events as readily to my recollection as if they had happened but a few weeks ago. Of two things at least I feel tolerably certain beforehand, in meditating over the contents of this book: First, that I can repeat correctly all that I have heard; and, secondly, that I have never missed anything worth hearing when my sitters were addressing me on an interesting subject. Although I cannot take the lead in talking while I am engaged in painting, I can listen while others speak, and work all the better for it. So much in the way of general preface to the pages for which I am about to ask the reader&#x27;s attention. Let me now advance to particulars, and describe how I came to hear the first story in the present collection. I begin with it because it is the story that I have oftenest &quot;rehearsed,&quot; to borrow a phrase from the stage. Wherever I go, I am sooner or later sure to tell it. Only last night, I was persuaded into repeating it once more by the inhabitants of the farmhouse in which I am now staying. Not many years ago, on returning from a short holiday visit to a friend settled in Paris, I found professional letters awaiting me at my agent&#x27;s in London, which required my immediate presence in Liverpool. Without stopping to unpack, I proceeded by the first conveyance to my new destination; and, calling at the picture-dealer&#x27;s shop, where portrait-painting engagements were received for me, found to my great satisfaction that I had remunerative employment in prospect, in and about Liverpool, for at least two months to come. I was putting up my letters in high spirits, and was just leaving the picture-dealer&#x27;s shop to look out for comfortable lodgings, when I was met at the door by the landlord of one of the largest hotels in Liverpool--an old acquaintance whom I had known as manager of a tavern in London in my student days. &quot;Mr. Kerby!&quot; he exclaimed, in great astonishment. &quot;What an unexpected meeting! the last man in the world whom I expected to see, and yet the very man whose services I want to make use of!&quot; &quot;What, more work for me?&quot; said I; &quot;are all the people in Liverpool going to have their portraits painted?&quot; &quot;I only know of one,&quot; replied the landlord, &quot;a gentleman staying at my hotel, who wants a chalk drawing done for him. I was on my way here to inquire of any artist whom our picture-dealing friend could recommend. How glad I am that I met you before I had committed myself to employing a stranger!&quot; &quot;Is this likeness wanted at once?&quot; I asked, thinking of the number of engagements that I had already got in my pocket. &quot;Immediately--to-day--this very hour, if possible,&quot; said the landlord. &quot;Mr. Faulkner, the gentleman I am speaking of, was to have sailed yesterday for the Brazils from this place; but the wind shifted last night to the wrong quarter, and he came ashore again this morning. He may of course be detained here for some time; but he may also be called on board ship at half an hour&#x27;s notice, if the wind shifts back again in the right direction. This uncertainty makes it a matter of importance that the likeness should be begun immediately. Undertake it if you possibly can, for Mr. Faulkner&#x27;s a liberal gentleman, who is sure to give you your own terms.&quot; I reflected for a minute or two. The portrait was only wanted in chalk, and would not take long; besides, I might finish it in the evening, if my other engagements pressed hard upon me in the daytime. Why not leave my luggage at the picture-dealer&#x27;s, put off looking for lodgings till night, and secure the new commission boldly by going back at once with the landlord to the hotel? I decided on following this course almost as soon as the idea occurred to me--put my chalks in my pocket, and a sheet of drawing paper in the first of my portfolios that came to hand--and so presented myself before Mr. Faulkner, ready to take his likeness, literally at five minutes&#x27; notice. I found him a very pleasant, intelligent man, young an d handsome. He had been a great traveler; had visited all the wonders of the East; and was now about to explore the wilds of the vast South American Continent. Thus much he told me good-humoredly and unconstrainedly while I was preparing my drawing materials. As soon as I had put him in the right light and position, and had seated myself opposite to him, he changed the subject of conversation, and asked me, a little confusedly as I thought, if it was not a customary practice among portrait-painters to gloss over the faults in their sitters&#x27; faces, and to make as much as possible of any good points which their features might possess. &quot;Certainly,&quot; I answered. &quot;You have described the whole art and mystery of successful portrait-painting in a few words.&quot; &quot;May I beg, then,&quot; said he, &#x27;that you will depart from the usual practice in my case, and draw me with all my defects, exactly as I am? The fact is,&quot; he went on, after a moment&#x27;s pause, &quot;the likeness you are now preparing to take is intended for my mother. My roving disposition makes me a great anxiety to her, and she parted from me this last time very sadly and unwillingly. I don&#x27;t know how the idea came into my head, but it struck me this morning that I could not better employ the time, while I was delayed here on shore, than by getting my likeness done to send to her as a keepsake. She has no portrait of me since I was a child, and she is sure to value a drawing of me more than anything else I could send to her. I only trouble you with this explanation to prove that I am really sincere in my wish to be drawn unflatteringly, exactly as I am.&quot; Secretly respecting and admiring him for what he had just said, I promised that his directions should be implicitly followed, and began to work immediately. Before I had pursued my occupation for ten minutes, the conversation began to flag, and the usual obstacle to my success with a sitter gradually set itself up between us. Quite unconsciously, of course, Mr. Faulkner stiffened his neck, shut his month, and contracted his eyebrows--evidently under the impression that he was facilitating the process of taking his portrait by making his face as like a lifeless mask as possible. All traces of his natural animated expression were fast disappearing, and he was beginning to change into a heavy and rather melancholy-looking man. This complete alteration was of no great consequence so long as I was only engaged in drawing the outline of his face and the general form of his features. I accordingly worked on doggedly for more than an hour--then left off to point my chalks again, and to give my sitter a few minutes&#x27; rest. Thus far the likeness had not suffered through Mr. Faulkner&#x27;s unfortunate notion of the right way of sitting for his portrait; but the time of difficulty, as I well knew, was to come. It was impossible for me to think of putting any expression into the drawing unless I could contrive some means, when he resumed his chair, of making him look like himself again. &quot;I will talk to him about foreign parts,&quot; thought I, &quot;and try if I can&#x27;t make him forget that he is sitting for his picture in that way.&quot; While I was pointing my chalks Mr. Faulkner was walking up and down the room. He chanced to see the portfolio I had brought with me leaning against the wall, and asked if there were any sketches in it. I told him there were a few which I had made during my recent stay in Paris; &quot;In Paris?&quot; he repeated, with a look of interest; &quot;may I see them?&quot; I gave him the permission he asked as a matter of course. Sitting down, he took the portfolio on his knee, and began to look through it. He turned over the first five sketches rapidly enough; but when he came to the sixth, I saw his face flush directly, and observed that he took the drawing out of the portfolio, carried it to the window, and remained silently absorbed in the contemplation of it for full five minutes. After that, he turned round to me, and asked very anxiously if I had any objection to part with that sketch. It was the least interesting drawing of the collection--merely a view in one of the streets running by the backs of the houses in the Palais Royal. Some four or five of these houses were comprised in the view, which was of no particular use to me in any way; and which was too valueless, as a work of art, for me to think of selling it. I begged his acceptance of it at once. He thanked me quite warmly; and then, seeing that I looked a little surprised at the odd selection he had made from my sketches, laughingly asked me if I could guess why he had been so anxious to become possessed of the view which I had given him? &quot;Probably,&quot; I answered, &quot;there is some remarkable historical association connected with that street at the back of the Palais Royal, of which I am ignorant.&quot; &quot;No,&quot; said Mr. Faulkner; &quot;at least none that _I_ know of. The only association connected with the place in _my_ mind is a purely personal association. Look at this house in your drawing--the house with the water-pipe running down it from top to bottom. I once passed a night there--a night I shall never forget to the day of my death. I have had some awkward  traveling adventures in my time; but _that_ adventure--! Well, never mind, suppose we begin the sitting. I make but a bad return for your kindness in giving me the sketch by thus wasting your time in mere talk. &quot;Come! come!&quot; thought I, as he went back to the sitter&#x27;s chair, &quot;I shall see your natural expression on your face if I can only get you to talk about that adventure.&quot; It was easy enough to lead him in the right direction. At the first hint from me, he returned to the subject of the house in the back street. Without, I hope, showing any undue curiosity, I contrived to let him see that I felt a deep interest in everything he now said. After two or three preliminary hesitations, he at last, to my great joy, fairly started on the narrative of his adventure. In the interest of his subject he soon completely forgot that he was sitting for his portrait--the very expression that I wanted came over his face--and my drawing proceeded toward completion, in the right direction, and to the best purpose. At every fresh touch I felt more and more certain that I was now getting the better of my grand difficulty; and I enjoyed the additional gratification of having my work lightened by the recital of a true story, which possessed, in my estimation, all the excitement of the most exciting romance. This, as I recollect it, is how Mr. Faulkner told me his adventure: THE TRAVELER&#x27;S STORY OF A TERRIBLY STRANGE BED. Shortly after my education at college was finished, I happened to be staying at Paris with an English friend. We were both young men then, and lived, I am afraid, rather a wild life, in the delightful city of our sojourn. One night we were idling about the neighborhood of the Palais Royal, doubtful to what amusement we should next betake ourselves. My friend proposed a visit to Frascati&#x27;s; but his suggestion was not to my taste. I knew Frascati&#x27;s, as the French saying is, by heart; had lost and won plenty of five-franc pieces there, merely for amusement&#x27;s sake, until it was amusement no longer, and was thoroughly tired, in fact, of all the ghastly respectabilities of such a social anomaly as a respectable gambling-house. &quot;For Heaven&#x27;s sake,&quot; said I to my friend, &quot;let us go somewhere where we can see a little genuine, blackguard, poverty-stricken gaming with no false gingerbread glitter thrown over it all. Let us get away from fashionable Frascati&#x27;s, to a house where they don&#x27;t mind letting in a man with a ragged coat, or a man with no coat, ragged or otherwise.&quot;  &quot;Very well,&quot; said my friend, &quot;we needn&#x27;t go out of the Palais Royal to find the sort of company you want. Here&#x27;s the place just before us; as blackguard a place, by all report, as you could possibly wish to see.&quot; In another minute we arrived at the door, and entered the house, the back of which you have drawn in your sketch. When we got upstairs, and had left our hats and sticks with the doorkeeper, we were admitted into the chief gambling-room. We did not find many people assembled there. But,  few as the men were who looked up at us on our entrance, they were all types--lamentably true types--of their respective classes. We had come to see blackguards; but these men were something worse. There is a comic side, more or less appreciable, in all blackguardism--here there was nothing but tragedy--mute, weird tragedy. The quiet in the room was horrible. The thin, haggard, long-haired young man, whose sunken eyes fiercely watched the turning up of the cards, never spoke; the flabby, fat-faced, pimply player, who pricked his piece of pasteboard perseveringly, to register how often black won, and how often red--never spoke; the dirty, wrinkled old man, with the vulture eyes and the darned great-coat, who had lost his last _sou,_ and still looked on desperately, after he could play no longer--never spoke. Even the voice of the croupier sounded as if it were strangely dulled and thickened in the atmosphere of the room. I had entered the place to laugh, but the spectacle before me was something to weep over. I soon found it necessary to take refuge in excitement from the depression of spirits which was fast stealing on me. Unfortunately I sought the nearest excitement, by going to the table and beginning to play. Still more unfortunately, as the event will show, I won--won prodigiously; won incredibly; won at such a rate that the regular players at the table crowded round me; and staring at my stakes with hungry, superstitious eyes, whispered to one another that the English stranger was going to break the bank. The game was _Rouge et Noir_. I had played at it in every city in Europe, without, however, the care or the wish to study the Theory of Chances--that philosopher&#x27;s stone of all gamblers! And a gambler, in the strict sense of the word, I had never been. I was heart-whole from the corroding passion for play. My gaming was a mere idle amusement. I never resorted to it by necessity, because I never knew what it was to want money. I never practiced it so incessantly as to lose more than I could afford, or to gain more than I could coolly pocket without being thrown off my balance by my good luck. In short, I had hitherto frequented gambling-tables--just as I frequented ball-rooms and opera-houses--because they amused me, and because I had nothing better to do with my leisure hours. But on this occasion it was very different--now, for the first time in my life, I felt what the passion for play really was. My success first bewildered, and then, in the most literal meaning of the word, intoxicated me. Incredible as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that I only lost when I attempted to estimate chances, and played according to previous calculation. If I left everything to luck, and staked without any care or consideration, I was sure to win--to win in the face of every recognized probability in favor of the bank. At first some of the men present ventured their money safely enough on my color; but I speedily increased my stakes to sums which they dared not risk. One after another they left off playing, and breathlessly looked on at my game. Still, time after time, I staked higher and higher, and still won. The excitement in the room rose to fever pitch. The silence was interrupted by a deep-muttered chorus of oaths and exclamations in different languages, every time the gold was shoveled across to my side of the table--even the imperturbable croupier dashed his rake on the floor in a (French) fury of astonishment at my success. But one man present preserved his self-possession, and that man was my friend. He came to my side, and whispering in English, begged me to leave the place, satisfied with what I had already gained. I must do him the justice to say that he repeated his warnings and entreaties several times, and only left me and went away after I had rejected his advice (I was to all intents and purposes gambling drunk) in terms which rendered it impossible for him to address me again that night. Shortly after he had gone, a hoarse voice behind me cried: &quot;Permit me, my dear sir--permit me to restore to their proper place two napoleons which you have dropped. Wonderful luck, sir! I pledge you my word of honor, as an old soldier, in the course of my long experience in this sort of thing, I never saw such luck as yours--never! Go on, sir--_Sacre mille bombes!_ Go on boldly, and break the bank!&quot; I turned round and saw, nodding and smiling at me with inveterate civility, a tall man, dressed in a frogged and braided surtout. If I had been in my senses, I should have considered him, personally, as being rather a suspicious specimen of an old soldier. He had goggling, bloodshot eyes, mangy mustaches, and a broken nose. His voice betrayed a barrack-room intonation of the worst order, and he had the dirtiest pair of hands I ever saw--even in France. These little personal peculiarities exercised, however, no repelling influence on me. In the mad excitement, the reckless triumph of that moment, I was ready to &quot;fraternize&quot; with anybody who encouraged me in my game. I accepted the old soldier&#x27;s offered pinch of snuff; clapped him on the back, and swore he was the honestest fellow in the world--the most glorious relic of the Grand Army that I had ever met with. &quot;Go on!&quot; cried my military friend, snapping his fingers in ecstasy--&quot;Go on, and win! Break the bank--_Mille tonnerres!_ my gallant English comrade, break the bank!&quot; And I _did_ go on--went on at such a rate, that in another quarter of an hour the croupier called out, &quot;Gentlemen, the bank has discontinued for to-night.&quot; All the notes, and all the gold in that &quot;bank,&quot; now lay in a heap under my hands; the whole floating capital of the gambling-house was waiting to pour into my pockets! &quot;Tie up the money in your pocket-handkerchief, my worthy sir,&quot; said the old soldier, as I wildly plunged my hands into my heap of gold. &quot;Tie it up, as we used to tie up a bit of dinner in the Grand Army; your winnings are too heavy for any breeches-pockets that ever were sewed. There! that&#x27;s it--shovel them in, notes and all! _Credie!_ what luck! Stop! another napoleon on the floor! _Ah! sacre petit polisson de Napoleon!_ have I found thee at last? Now then, sir--two tight double knots each way with your honorable permission, and the money&#x27;s safe. Feel it! feel it, fortunate sir! hard and round as a cannon-ball--_Ah, bah!_ if they had only fired such cannon-balls at us at Austerlitz--_nom d&#x27;une pipe!_ if they only had! And now, as an ancient grenadier, as an ex-brave of the French army, what remains for me to do? I ask what? Simply this: to entreat my valued English friend to drink a bottle of Champagne with me, and toast the goddess Fortune in foaming goblets before we part!&quot; Excellent ex-brave! Convivial ancient grenadier! Champagne by all means! An English cheer for an old soldier! Hurrah! hurrah! Another English cheer for the goddess Fortune! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! &quot;Bravo! the Englishman; the amiable, gracious Englishman, in whose veins circulates the vivacious blood of France! Another glass? _Ah, bah!_--the bottle is empty! Never mind! _Vive le vin!_ I, the old soldier, order another bottle, and half a pound of bonbons with it!&quot; &quot;No, no, ex-brave; never--ancient grenadier! _Your_ bottle last time; _my_ bottle this. Behold it! Toast away! The French Army! the great Napoleon! the present company! the croupier! the honest croupier&#x27;s wife and daughters--if he has any! the Ladies generally! everybody in the world!&quot; By the time the second bottle of Champagne was emptied, I felt as if I had been drinking liquid fire--my brain seemed all aflame. No excess in wine had ever had this effect on me before in my life. Was it the result of a stimulant acting upon my system when I was in a highly excited state? Was my stomach in a particularly disordered condition? Or was the Champagne amazingly strong? &quot;Ex-brave of the French Army!&quot; cried I, in a mad state of exhilaration, &quot;_I_ am on fire! how are _you?_ You have set me on fire! Do you hear, my hero of Austerlitz? Let us have a third bottle of Champagne to put the flame out!&quot; The old soldier wagged his head, rolled his goggle-eyes, until I expected to see  them slip out of their sockets; placed his dirty forefinger by the side of his broken nose; solemnly ejaculated &quot;Coffee!&quot; and immediately ran off into an inner room. The word pronounced by the eccentric veteran seemed to have a magical effect on the rest of the company present. With one accord they all rose to depart. Probably they had expected to profit by my intoxication; but finding that my new friend was benevolently bent on preventing me from getting dead drunk, had now abandoned all hope of thriving pleasantly on my winnings. Whatever their motive might be, at any rate they went away in a body. When the old soldier returned, and sat down again opposite to me at the table, we had the room to ourselves. I could see the croupier, in a sort of vestibule which opened out of it, eating his supper in solitude. The silence was now deeper than ever. A sudden change, too, had come over the &quot;ex-brave.&quot; He assumed a portentously solemn look; and when he spoke to me again, his speech was ornamented by no oaths, enforced by no finger-snapping, enlivened by no apostrophes or exclamations. &quot;Listen, my dear sir,&quot; said he, in mysteriously confidential tones--&quot;listen to an old soldier&#x27;s advice. I have been to the mistress of the house (a very charming woman, with a genius for cookery!) to impress on her the necessity of making us some particularly strong and good coffee. You must drink this coffee in order to get rid of your little amiable exaltation of spirits before you think of going home--you _must,_ my good and gracious friend! With all that money to take home to-night, it is a sacred duty to yourself to have your wits about you. You are known to be a winner to an enormous extent by several gentlemen present to-night, who, in a certain point of view, are very worthy and excellent fellows; but they are mortal men, my dear sir, and they have their amiable weaknesses. Need I say more? Ah, no, no! you understand me! Now, this is what you must do--send for a cabriolet when you feel quite well again--draw up all the windows when you get into it--and tell the driver to take you home only through the large and well-lighted thoroughfares. Do this; and you and your money will be safe. Do this; and to-morrow you will thank an old soldier for giving you a word of honest advice.&quot; Just as the ex-brave ended his oration in very lachrymose tones, the coffee came in, ready poured out in two cups. My attentive friend handed me one of the cups with a bow. I was parched with thirst, and drank it off at a draught. Almost instantly afterwards, I was seized with a fit of giddiness, and felt more completely intoxicated than ever. The room whirled round and round furiously; the old soldier seemed to be regularly bobbing up and down before me like the piston of a steam-engine. I was half deafened by a violent singing in my ears; a feeling of utter bewilderment, helplessness, idiocy, overcame me. I rose from my chair, holding on by the table to keep my balance; and stammered out that I felt dreadfully unwell--so unwell that I did not know how I was to get home. &quot;My dear friend,&quot; answered the old soldier--and even his voice seemed to be bobbing up and down as he spoke--&quot;my dear friend, it would be madness to go home in _your_ state; you would be sure to lose your money; you might be robbed and murdered with the greatest ease. _I_ am going to sleep here; do _you_ sleep here, too--they make up capital beds in this house--take one; sleep off the effects of the wine, and go home safely with your winnings to-morrow--to-morrow, in broad daylight.&quot; I had but two ideas left: one, that I must never let go hold of my handkerchief full of money; the other, that I must lie down somewhere immediately, and fall off into a comfortable sleep. So I agreed to the proposal about the bed, and took the offered arm of the old soldier, carrying my money with my disengaged hand. Preceded by the croupier, we passed along some passages and up a flight of stairs into the bedroom which I was to occupy. The ex-brave shook me warmly by the hand, proposed that we should breakfast together, and then, followed by the croupier, left me for the night. I ran to the wash-hand stand; drank some of the water in my jug; poured the rest out, and plunged my face into it; then sat down in a chair and tried to compose myself. I soon felt better. The change for my lungs, from the fetid atmosphere of the gambling-room to the cool air of the apartment I now occupied, the almost equally refreshing change for my eyes, from the glaring gaslights of the &quot;salon&quot; to the dim, quiet flicker of one bedroom-candle, aided wonderfully the restorative effects of cold water. The giddiness left me, and I began to feel a little like a reasonable being again. My first thought was of the risk of sleeping all night in a gambling-house; my second, of the still greater risk of trying to get out after the house was closed, and of going home alone at night through the streets of Paris with a large sum of money about me. I had slept in worse places than this on my travels; so I determined to lock, bolt, and barricade my door, and take my chance till the next morning. Accordingly, I secured myself against all intrusion; looked under the bed, and into the cupboard; tried the fastening of the window; and then, satisfied that I had taken every proper precaution, pulled off my upper clothing, put my light, which was a dim one, on the hearth among a feathery litter of wood-ashes, and got into bed, with the handkerchief full of money under my pillow. I soon felt not only that I could not go to sleep, but that I could not even close my eyes. I was wide awake, and in a high fever. Every nerve in my body trembled--every one of my senses seemed to be preternaturally sharpened. I tossed and rolled, and tried every kind of position, and perseveringly sought out the cold corners of the bed, and all to no purpose. Now I thrust my arms over the clothes; now I poked them under the clothes; now I violently shot my legs straight out down to the bottom of the bed; now I convulsively coiled them up as near my chin as they would go; now I shook out my crumpled pillow, changed it to the cool side, patted it flat, and lay down quietly on my back; now I fiercely doubled it in two, set it up on end, thrust it against the board of the bed, and tried a sitting posture. Every effort was in vain; I groaned with vexation as I felt that I was in for a sleepless night. What could I do? I had no book to read. And yet, unless I found out some method of diverting my mind, I felt certain that I was in the condition to imagine all sorts of horrors; to rack my brain with forebodings of every possible and impossible danger; in short, to pass the night in suffering all conceivable varieties of nervous terror. I raised myself on my elbow, and looked about the room--which was brightened by a lovely moonlight pouring straight through the window--to see if it contained any pictures or ornaments that I could at all clearly distinguish. While my eyes wandered from wall to wall, a remembrance of Le Maistre&#x27;s delightful little book, &quot;Voyage autour de ma Chambre,&quot; occurred to me. I resolved to imitate the French author, and find occupation and amusement enough to relieve the tedium of my wakefulness, by making a mental inventory of every article of furniture I could see, and by following up to their sources the multitude of associations which even a chair, a table, or a wash-hand stand may be made to call forth. In the nervous unsettled state of my mind at that moment, I found it much easier to make my inventory than to make my reflections, and thereupon soon gave up all hope of thinking in Le Maistre&#x27;s fanciful track--or, indeed, of thinking at all. I looked about the room at the different articles of furniture, and did nothing more. There was, first, the bed I was lying in; a four-post bed, of all things in the world to meet with in Paris--yes, a thorough clumsy British four-poster, with the regular top lined with chintz--the regular fringed valance all round--the regular stifling, unwholesome curtains, which I remembered having mechanically drawn back against the posts with out particularly noticing the bed when I first got into the room. Then there was the marble-topped wash-hand stand, from which the water I had spilled, in my hurry to pour it out, was still dripping, slowly and more slowly, on to the brick floor. Then two small chairs, with my coat, waistcoat, and trousers flung on them. Then a large elbow-chair covered with dirty-white dimity, with my cravat and shirt collar thrown over the back. Then a chest of drawers with two of the brass handles off, and a tawdry, broken china inkstand placed on it by way of ornament for the top. Then the dressing-table, adorned by a very small looking-glass, and a very large pincushion. Then the window--an unusually large window. Then a dark old picture, which the feeble candle dimly showed me. It was a picture of a fellow in a high Spanish hat, crowned with a plume of towering feathers. A swarthy, sinister ruffian, looking upward, shading his eyes with his hand, and looking intently upward--it might be at some tall gallows at which he was going to be hanged. At any rate, he had the appearance of thoroughly deserving it. This picture put a kind of constraint upon me to look upward too--at the top of the bed. It was a gloomy and not an interesting object, and I looked back at the picture. I counted the feathers in the man&#x27;s hat--they stood out in relief--three white, two green. I observed the crown of his hat, which was of conical shape, according to the fashion supposed to have been favored by Guido Fawkes. I wondered what he was looking up at. It couldn&#x27;t be at the stars; such a desperado was neither astrologer nor astronomer. It must be at the high gallows, and he was going to be hanged presently. Would the executioner come into possession of his conical crowned hat and plume of feathers? I counted the feathers again--three white, two green. While I still lingered over this very improving and intellectual employment, my thoughts insensibly began to wander. The moonlight shining into the room reminded me of a certain moonlight night in England--the night after a picnic party in a Welsh valley. Every incident of the drive homeward, through lovely scenery, which the moonlight made lovelier than ever, came back to my remembrance, though I had never given the picnic a thought for years; though, if I had _tried_ to recollect it, I could certainly have recalled little or nothing of that scene long past. Of all the wonderful faculties that help to tell us we are immortal, which speaks the sublime truth more eloquently than memory? Here was I, in a strange house of the most suspicious character, in a situation of uncertainty, and even of peril, which might seem to make the cool exercise of my recollection almost out of the question; nevertheless, remembering, quite involuntarily, places, people, conversations, minute circumstances of every kind, which I had thought forgotten forever; which I could not possibly have recalled at will, even under the most favorable auspices. And what cause had produced in a moment the whole of this strange, complicated, mysterious effect? Nothing but some rays of moonlight shining in at my bedroom window. I was still thinking of the picnic--of our merriment on the drive home--of the sentimental young lady who _would_ quote &quot;Childe Harold&quot; because it was moonlight. I was absorbed by these past scenes and past amusements, when, in an instant, the thread on which my memories hung snapped asunder; my attention immediately came back to present things more vividly than ever, and I found myself, I neither knew why nor wherefore, looking hard at the picture again. Looking for what? Good God! the man had pulled his hat down on his brows! No! the hat itself was gone! Where was the conical crown? Where the feathers--three white, two green? Not there! In place of the hat and feathers, what dusky object was it that now hid his forehead, his eyes, his shading hand? Was the bed moving? I turned on my back and looked up. Was I mad? drunk? dreaming? giddy again? or was the top of the bed really moving down--sinking slowly, regularly, silently, horribly, right down throughout the whole of its length and breadth--right down upon me, as I lay underneath? My blood seemed to stand still. A deadly paralysing coldness stole all over me as I turned my head round on the pillow and determined to test whether the bed-top was really moving or not, by keeping my eye on the man in the picture. The next look in that direction was enough. The dull, black, frowzy outline of the valance above me was within an inch of being parallel with his waist. I still looked breathlessly. And steadily and slowly--very slowly--I saw the figure, and the line of frame below the figure, vanish, as the valance moved down before it. I am, constitutionally, anything but timid. I have been on more than one occasion in peril of my life, and have not lost my self-possession for an instant; but when the conviction first settled on my mind that the bed-top was really moving, was steadily and continuously sinking down upon me, I looked up shuddering, helpless, panic-stricken, beneath the hideous machinery for murder, which was advancing closer and closer to suffocate me where I lay. I looked up, motionless, speechless, breathless. The candle, fully spent, went out; but the moonlight still brightened the room. Down and down, without pausing and without sounding, came the bed-top, and still my panic-terror seemed to bind me faster and faster to the mattress on which I lay--down and down it sank, till the dusty odor from the lining of the canopy came stealing into my nostrils. At that final moment the instinct of self-preservation startled me out of my trance, and I moved at last. There was just room for me to roll myself sidewise off the bed. As I dropped noiselessly to the floor, the edge of the murderous canopy touched me on the shoulder. Without stopping to draw my breath, without wiping the cold sweat from my face, I rose instantly on my knees to watch the bed-top. I was literally spellbound by it. If I had heard footsteps behind me, I could not have turned round; if a means of escape had been miraculously provided for me, I could not have moved to take advantage of it. The whole life in me was, at that moment, concentrated in my eyes. It descended--the whole canopy, with the fringe round it, came down--down--close down; so close that there was not room now to squeeze my finger between the bed-top and the bed. I felt at the sides, and discovered that what had appeared to me from beneath to be the ordinary light canopy of a four-post bed was in reality a thick, broad mattress, the substance of which was concealed by the valance and its fringe. I looked up and saw the four posts rising hideously bare. In the middle of the bed-top was a huge wooden screw that had evidently worked it down through a hole in the ceiling, just as ordinary presses are worked down on the substance selected for compression. The frightful apparatus moved without making the faintest noise. There had been no creaking as it came down; there was now not the faintest sound from the room above. Amid a dead and awful silence I beheld before me--in the nineteenth century, and in the civilized capital of France--such a machine for secret murder by suffocation as might have existed in the worst days of the Inquisition, in the lonely inns among the Hartz Mountains, in the mysterious tribunals of Westphalia! Still, as I looked on it, I could not move, I could hardly breathe, but I began to recover the power of thinking, and in a moment I discovered the murderous conspiracy framed against me in all its horror. My cup of coffee had been drugged, and drugged too strongly. I had been saved from being smothered by having taken an overdose of some narcotic. How I had chafed and fretted at the fever fit which had preserved my life by keeping me awake! How recklessly I had confided myself to the two wretches who had led me into this room, determined, for the sake of my winnings, to kill me in my sleep by the surest and most horrible contrivance for secretly accomplishing my destruction! How many men, winners like me, had slept, as  I had proposed to sleep, in that bed, and had never been seen or heard of more! I shuddered at the bare idea of it. But, ere long, all thought was again suspended by the sight of the murderous canopy moving once more. After it had remained on the bed--as nearly as I could guess--about ten minutes, it began to move up again. The villains who worked it from above evidently believed that their purpose was now accomplished. Slowly and silently, as it had descended, that horrible bed-top rose towards its former place. When it reached the upper extremities of the four posts, it reached the ceiling, too. Neither hole nor screw could be seen; the bed became in appearance an ordinary bed again--the canopy an ordinary canopy--even to the most suspicious eyes. Now, for the first time, I was able to move--to rise from my knees--to dress myself in my upper clothing--and to consider of how I should escape. If I betrayed by the smallest noise that the attempt to suffocate me had failed, I was certain to be murdered. Had I made any noise already? I listened intently, looking towards the door. No! no footsteps in the passage outside--no sound of a tread, light or heavy, in the room above--absolute silence everywhere. Besides locking and bolting my door, I had moved an old wooden chest against it, which I had found under the bed. To remove this chest (my blood ran cold as I thought of what its contents _might_ be!) without making some disturbance was impossible; and, moreover, to think of escaping through the house, now barred up for the night, was sheer insanity. Only one chance was left me--the window. I stole to it on tiptoe. My bedroom was on the first floor, above an _entresol,_ and looked into a back street, which you have sketched in your view. I raised my hand to open the window, knowing that on that action hung, by the merest hair-breadth, my chance of safety. They keep vigilant watch in a House of Murder. If any part of the frame cracked, if the hinge creaked, I was a lost man! It must have occupied me at least five minutes, reckoning by time--five _hours,_ reckoning by suspense--to open that window. I succeeded in doing it silently--in doing it with all the dexterity of a house-breaker--and then looked down into the street. To leap the distance beneath me would be almost certain destruction! Next, I looked round at the sides of the house. Down the left side ran a thick water-pipe which you have drawn--it passed close by the outer edge of the window. The moment I saw the pipe I knew I was saved. My breath came and went freely for the first time since I had seen the canopy of the bed moving down upon me! To some men the means of escape which I had discovered might have seemed difficult and dangerous enough--to _me_ the prospect of slipping down the pipe into the street did not suggest even a thought of peril. I had always been accustomed, by the practice of gymnastics, to keep up my school-boy powers as a daring and expert climber; and knew that my head, hands, and feet would serve me faithfully in any hazards of ascent or descent. I had already got one leg over the window-sill, when I remembered the handkerchief filled with money under my pillow. I could well have afforded to leave it behind me, but I was revengefully determined that the miscreants of the gambling-house should miss their plunder as well as their victim. So I went back to the bed and tied the heavy handkerchief at my back by my cravat. Just as I had made it tight and fixed it in a comfortable place, I thought I heard a sound of breathing outside the door. The chill feeling of horror ran through me again as I listened. No! dead silence still in the passage--I had only heard the night air blowing softly into the room. The next moment I was on the window-sill--and the next I had a firm grip on the water-pipe with my hands and knees. I slid down into the street easily and quietly, as I thought I should, and immediately set off at the top of my speed to a branch &quot;Prefecture&quot; of Police, which I knew was situated in the immediate neighbourhood. A &quot;Sub-prefect,&quot; and several picked men among his subordinates, happened to be up, maturing, I believe, some scheme for discovering the perpetrator of a mysterious murder which all Paris was talking of just then. When I began my story, in a breathless hurry and in very bad French, I could see that the Sub-prefect suspected me of being a drunken Englishman who had robbed somebody; but he soon altered his opinion as I went on, and before I had anything like concluded, he shoved all the papers before him into a drawer, put on his hat, supplied me with another (for I was bareheaded), ordered a file of soldiers, desired his expert followers to get ready all sorts of tools for breaking open doors and ripping up brick flooring, and took my arm, in the most friendly and familiar manner possible, to lead me with him out of the house. I will venture to say that when the Sub-prefect was a little boy, and was taken for the first time to the play, he was not half as much pleased as he was now at the job in prospect for him at the gambling-house! Away we went through the streets, the Sub-prefect cross-examining and congratulating me in the same breath as we marched at the head of our formidable _posse comitatus._ Sentinels were placed at the back and front of the house the moment we got to it; a tremendous battery of knocks was directed against the door; a light appeared at a window; I was told to conceal myself behind the police--then came more knocks and a cry of &quot;Open in the name of the law!&quot; At that terrible summons bolts and locks gave way before an invisible hand, and the moment after the Sub-prefect was in the passage, confronting a waiter half-dressed and ghastly pale. This was the short dialogue which immediately took place: &quot;We want to see the Englishman who is sleeping in this house?&quot; &quot;He went away hours ago.&quot; &quot;He did no such thing. His friend went away; _he_ remained. Show us to his bedroom!&quot; &quot;I swear to you, Monsieur le Sous-prefect, he is not here! he--&quot; &quot;I swear to you, Monsieur le Garcon, he is. He slept here--he didn&#x27;t find your bed comfortable--he came to us to complain of it--here he is among my men--and here am I ready to look for a flea or two in his bedstead. Renaudin! (calling to one of the subordinates, and pointing to the waiter) collar that man and tie his hands behind him. Now, then, gentlemen, let us walk upstairs!&quot; Every man and woman in the house was secured--the &quot;Old Soldier&quot; the first. Then I identified the bed in which I had slept, and then we went into the room above. No object that was at all extraordinary appeared in any part of it. The Sub-prefect looked round the place, commanded everybody to be silent, stamped twice on the floor, called for a candle, looked attentively at the spot he had stamped on, and ordered the flooring there to be carefully taken up. This was done in no time. Lights were produced, and we saw a deep raftered cavity between the floor of this room and the ceiling of the room beneath. Through this cavity there ran perpendicularly a sort of case of iron thickly greased; and inside the case appeared the screw, which communicated with the bed-top below. Extra lengths of screw, freshly oiled; levers covered with felt; all the complete upper works of a heavy press--constructed with infernal ingenuity so as to join the fixtures below, and when taken to pieces again, to go into the smallest possible compass--were next discovered and pulled out on the floor. After some little difficulty the Sub-prefect succeeded in putting the machinery together, and, leaving his men to work it, descended with me to the bedroom. The smothering canopy was then lowered, but not so noiselessly as I had seen it lowered. When I mentioned this to the Sub-prefect, his answer, simple as it was, had a terrible significance. &quot;My men,&quot; said he, &quot;are working down the bed-top for the first time--the men whose money you won were in better practice.&quot; We left the house in the sole possession of two police agents--every one of the inmates being removed to prison on the spot. The Sub-prefect, after taking down my _&quot;proces verbal &quot;_ in his office, returned with me to my hotel to get my passport. &quot;Do you think,&quot; I asked, as I gave it to him, &quot;that any men have really been smothered in that bed, as they tried to smother _me?_&quot; &quot;I have seen dozens of drowned men laid out at the Morgue,&quot; answered the Sub-prefect, &quot;in whose pocketbooks were found letters stating that they had committed suicide in the Seine, because they had lost everything at the gaming table. Do I know how many of those men entered the same gambling-house that _you_ entered? won as _you_ won? took that bed as _you_ took it? slept in it? were smothered in it? and were privately thrown into the river, with a letter of explanation written by the murderers and placed in their pocket-books? No man can say how many or how few have suffered the fate from which you have escaped. The people of the gambling-house kept their bedstead machinery a secret from _us_--even from the police! The dead kept the rest of the secret for them. Good-night, or rather good-morning, Monsieur Faulkner! Be at my office again at nine o&#x27;clock--in the meantime, _au revoir!_&quot; The rest of my story is soon told. I was examined and re-examined; the gambling-house was strictly searched all through from top to bottom; the prisoners were separately interrogated; and two of the less guilty among them made a confession. I discovered that the Old Soldier was the master of the gambling-house--_justice_ discovered that he had been drummed out of the army as a vagabond years ago; that he had been guilty of all sorts of villainies since; that he was in possession of stolen property, which the owners identified; and that he, the croupier, another accomplice, and the woman who had made my cup of coffee, were all in the secret of the bedstead. There appeared some reason to doubt whether the inferior persons attached to the house knew anything of the suffocating machinery; and they received the benefit of that doubt, by being treated simply as thieves and vagabonds. As for the Old Soldier and his two head myrmidons, they went to the galleys; the woman who had drugged my coffee was imprisoned for I forget how many years; the regular attendants at the gambling-house were considered &quot;suspicious&quot; and placed under &quot;surveillance&quot;; and I became, for one whole week (which is a long time) the head &quot;lion&quot; in Parisian society. My adventure was dramatized by three illustrious play-makers, but never saw theatrical daylight; for the censorship forbade the introduction on the stage of a correct copy of the gambling-house bedstead. One good result was produced by my adventure, which any censorship must have approved: it cured me of ever again trying _&quot;Rouge et Noir&quot;_ as an amusement. The sight of a green cloth, with packs of cards and heaps of money on it, will henceforth be forever associated in my mind with the sight of a bed canopy descending to suffocate me in the silence and darkness of the night. Just as Mr. Faulkner pronounced these words he started in his chair, and resumed his stiff, dignified position in a great hurry. &quot;Bless my soul!&quot; cried he, with a comic look of astonishment and vexation, &quot;while I have been telling you what is the real secret of my interest in the sketch you have so kindly given to me, I have altogether forgotten that I came here to sit for my portrait. For the last hour or more I must have been the worst model you ever had to draw from!&quot; &quot;On the contrary, you have been the best,&quot; said I. &quot;I have been trying to catch your likeness; and, while telling your story, you have unconsciously shown me the natural expression I wanted to insure my success.&quot; NOTE BY MRS. KERBY. I cannot let this story end without mentioning what the chance saying was which caused it to be told at the farmhouse the other night. Our friend the young sailor, among his other quaint objections to sleeping on shore, declared that he particularly hated four-post beds, because he never slept in one without doubting whether the top might not come down in the night and suffocate him. I thought this chance reference to the distinguishing feature of William&#x27;s narrative curious enough, and my husband agreed with me. But he says it is scarcely worth while to mention such a trifle in anything so important as a book. I cannot venture, after this, to do more than slip these lines in modestly at the end of the story. If the printer should notice my few last words, perhaps he may not mind the trouble of putting them into some out-of-the-way corner. L. K. PROLOGUE TO THE SECOND STORY. THE beginning of an excellent connection which I succeeded in establishing in and around that respectable watering-place, Tidbury-on-the-Marsh, was an order for a life-size oil portrait of a great local celebrity--one Mr. Boxsious, a solicitor, who was understood to do the most thriving business of any lawyer in the town. The portrait was intended as a testimonial &quot;expressive (to use the language of the circular forwarded to me at the time) of the eminent services of Mr. Boxsious in promoting and securing the prosperity of the town.&quot; It had been subscribed for by the &quot;Municipal Authorities and Resident Inhabitants&quot; of Tidbury-on-the-Marsh; and it was to be presented, when done, to Mrs. Boxsious, &quot;as a slight but sincere token&quot;--and so forth. A timely recommendation from one of my kindest friends and patrons placed the commission for painting the likeness in my lucky hands; and I was instructed to attend on a certain day at Mr. Boxsious&#x27;s private residence, with all my materials ready for taking a first sitting. On arriving at the house, I was shown into a very prettily furnished morning-room. The bow-window looked out on a large inclosed meadow, which represented the principal square in Tidbury. On the opposite side of the meadow I could see the new hotel (with a wing lately added), and close by, the old hotel obstinately unchanged since it had first been built. Then, further down the street, the doctor&#x27;s house, with a colored lamp and a small door-plate, and the banker&#x27;s office, with a plain lamp and a big door-plate--then some dreary private lodging-houses--then, at right angles to these, a street of shops; the cheese-monger&#x27;s very small, the chemist&#x27;s very smart, the pastry-cook&#x27;s very dowdy, and the green-grocer&#x27;s very dark, I was still looking out at the view thus presented, when I was suddenly apostrophized by a glib, disputatious voice behind me. &quot;Now, then, Mr. Artist,&quot; cried the voice, &quot;do you call that getting ready for work? Where are your paints and brushes, and all the rest of it? My name&#x27;s Boxsious, and I&#x27;m here to sit for my picture.&quot; I turned round, and confronted a little man with his legs astraddle, and his hands in his pockets. He had light-gray eyes, red all round the lids, bristling pepper-colored hair, an unnaturally rosy complexion, and an eager, impudent, clever look. I made two discoveries in one glance at him: First, that he was a wretched subject for a portrait; secondly, that, whatever he might do or say, it would not be of the least use for me to stand on my dignity with him. &quot;I shall be ready directly, sir, &quot; said I. &quot;Ready directly?&quot; repeated my new sitter. &quot;What do you mean, Mr. Artist, by ready directly? I&#x27;m ready now. What was your contract with the Town Council, who have subscribed for this picture? To paint the portrait. And what was my contract? To sit for it. Here am I ready to sit, and there are you not ready to paint me. According to all the rules of law and logic, you are committing a breach of contract already. Stop! let&#x27;s have a look at your paints. Are they the best quality? If not, I warn you, sir, there&#x27;s a second breach of contract! Brushes, too? Why, they&#x27;re old brushes, by the Lord Harry! The Town Council pays you well, Mr. Artist; why don&#x27;t you work for them with new brushes? What? you work best with old? I contend, sir, that you can&#x27;t. Does my housemaid clean best with an old broom? Do my clerks write best with old pens? Don&#x27;t color up, and don&#x27;t look as if you were going to quarrel with me! You can&#x27;t quarrel with me. If you were fifty times as irritable a man as you look, you couldn&#x27;t quarrel with me. I&#x27;m not young, and I&#x27;m  not touc hy--I&#x27;m Boxsious, the lawyer; the only man in the world who can&#x27;t be insulted, try it how you like!&quot; He chuckled as he said this, and walked away to the window. It was quite useless to take anything he said seriously, so I finished preparing my palette for the morning&#x27;s work with the utmost serenity of look and manner that I could possibly assume. &quot;There!&quot; he went on, looking out of the window; &quot;do you see that fat man slouching along the Parade, with a snuffy nose? That&#x27;s my favorite enemy, Dunball. He tried to quarrel with me ten years ago, and he has done nothing but bring out the hidden benevolence of my character ever since. Look at him! look how he frowns as he turns this way. And now look at me! I can smile and nod to him. I make a point of always smiling and nodding to him--it keeps my hand in for other enemies. Good-morning! (I&#x27;ve cast him twice in heavy damages) good-morning, Mr. Dunball. He bears malice, you see; he won&#x27;t speak; he&#x27;s short in the neck, passionate, and four times as fat as he ought to be; he has fought against my amiability for ten mortal years; when he can&#x27;t fight any longer, he&#x27;ll die suddenly, and I shall be the innocent cause of it.&quot; Mr. Boxsious uttered this fatal prophecy with extraordinary complacency, nodding and smiling out of the window all the time at the unfortunate man who had rashly tried to provoke him. When his favorite enemy was out of sight, he turned away, and indulged himself in a brisk turn or two up and down the room. Meanwhile I lifted my canvas on the easel, and was on the point of asking him to sit down, when he assailed me again. &quot;Now, Mr. Artist,&quot; he cried, quickening his walk impatiently, &quot;in the interests of the Town Council, your employers, allow me to ask you for the last time when you are going to begin?&quot; &quot;And allow me, Mr. Boxsious, in the interest of the Town Council also,&quot; said I, &quot;to ask you if your notion of the proper way of sitting for your portrait is to walk about the room!&quot; &quot;Aha! well put--devilish well put!&quot; returned Mr. Boxsious; &quot;that&#x27;s the only sensible thing you have said since you entered my house; I begin to like you already.&quot; With these words he nodded at me approvingly, and jumped into the high chair that I had placed for him with the alacrity of a young man. &quot;I say, Mr. Artist,&quot; he went on, when I had put him into the right position (he insisted on the front view of his face being taken, because the Town Council would get the most for their money in that way), &quot;you don&#x27;t have many such good jobs as this, do you?&quot; &quot;Not many,&quot; I said. &quot;I should not be a poor man if commissions for life-size portraits often fell in my way.&quot; &quot;You poor!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Boxsious, contemptuously. &quot;I dispute that point with you at the outset. Why, you&#x27;ve got a good cloth coat, a clean shirt, and a smooth-shaved chin. You&#x27;ve got the sleek look of a man who has slept between sheets and had his breakfast. You can&#x27;t humbug me about poverty, for I know what it is. Poverty means looking like a scarecrow, feeling like a scarecrow, and getting treated like a scarecrow. That was _my_ luck, let me tell you, when I first thought of trying the law. Poverty, indeed! Do you shake in your shoes, Mr. Artist, when you think what you were at twenty? I do, I can promise you.&quot; He began to shift about so irritably in his chair, that, in the interests of my work, I was obliged to make an effort to calm him. &quot;It must be a pleasant occupation for you in your present prosperity,&quot; said I, &quot;to look back sometimes at the gradual processes by which you passed from poverty to competence, and from that to the wealth you now enjoy.&quot; &quot;Gradual, did you say?&quot; cried Mr. Boxsious; &quot;it wasn&#x27;t gradual at all. I was sharp--damned sharp, and I jumped at my first start in business slap into five hundred pounds in one day.&quot; &quot;That was an extraordinary step in advance,&quot; I rejoined. &quot;I suppose you contrived to make some profitable investment--&quot; &quot;Not a bit of it! I hadn&#x27;t a spare sixpence to invest with. I won the money by my brains, my hands, and my pluck; and, what&#x27;s more, I&#x27;m proud of having done it. That was rather a curious case, Mr. Artist. Some men might be shy of mentioning it; I never was shy in my life and I mention it right and left everywhere--the whole case, just as it happened, except the names. Catch me ever committing myself to mentioning names! Mum&#x27;s the word, sir, with yours to command, Thomas Boxsious.&quot; &quot;As you mention &#x27;the case&#x27; everywhere,&quot; said I, &quot;perhaps you would not be offended with me if I told you I should like to hear it?&quot; &quot;Man alive! haven&#x27;t I told you already that I can&#x27;t be offended? And didn&#x27;t I say a moment ago that I was proud of the case? I&#x27;ll tell you, Mr. Artist--but stop! I&#x27;ve got the interests of the Town Council to look after in this business. Can you paint as well when I&#x27;m talking as when I&#x27;m not? Don&#x27;t sneer, sir; you&#x27;re not wanted to sneer--you&#x27;re wanted to give an answer--yes or no?&quot; &quot;Yes, then,&quot; I replied, in his own sharp way. &quot;I can always paint the better when I am hearing an interesting story.&quot; &quot;What do you mean by talking about a story? I&#x27;m not going to tell you a story; I&#x27;m going to make a statement. A statement is a matter of fact, therefore the exact opposite of a story, which is a matter of fiction. What I am now going to tell you really happened to me.&quot; I was glad to see that he settled himself quietly in his chair before he began. His odd manners and language made such an impression on me at the time, that I think I can repeat his &quot;statement&quot; now, almost word for word as he addressed it to me. THE LAWYER&#x27;S STORY OF A STOLEN LETTER. I SERVED my time--never mind in whose office--and I started in business for myself in one of our English country towns, I decline stating which. I hadn&#x27;t a farthing of capital, and my friends in the neighborhood were poor and useless enough, with one exception. That exception was Mr. Frank Gatliffe, son of Mr. Gatliffe, member for the county, the richest man and the proudest for many a mile round about our parts. Stop a bit, Mr. Artist, you needn&#x27;t perk up and look knowing. You won&#x27;t trace any particulars by the name of Gatliffe. I&#x27;m not bound to commit myself or anybody else by mentioning names. I have given you the first that came into my head. Well, Mr. Frank was a stanch friend of mine, and ready to recommend me whenever he got the chance. I had contrived to get him a little timely help--for a consideration, of course--in borrowing money at a fair rate of interest; in fact, I had saved him from the Jews. The money was borrowed while Mr. Frank was at college. He came back from college, and stopped at home a little while, and then there got spread about all our neighborhood a report that he had fallen in love, as the saying is, with his young sister&#x27;s governess, and that his mind was made up to marry her. What! you&#x27;re at it again, Mr. Artist! You want to know her name, don&#x27;t you? What do you think of Smith? Speaking as a lawyer, I consider report, in a general way, to be a fool and a liar. But in this case report turned out to be something very different. Mr. Frank told me he was really in love, and said upon his honor (an absurd expression which young chaps of his age are always using) he was determined to marry Smith, the governess--the sweet, darling girl, as _he_ called her; but I&#x27;m not sentimental, and _I_ call her Smith, the governess. Well, Mr. Frank&#x27;s father, being as proud as Lucifer, said &quot;No,&quot; as to marrying the governess, when Mr. Frank wanted him to say &quot;Yes.&quot; He was a man of business, was old Gatliffe, and he took the proper business course. He sent the governess away with a first-rate character and a spanking present, and then he, looked about him to get something for Mr. Frank to do. While he was looking about, Mr. Frank bolted to London after the governess, who had nobody alive belonging to her to go to but an aunt--her father&#x27;s sister. The aunt refuses to let Mr. Frank in without the squire&#x27;s permission. Mr. Frank writes to his father, and says he will marry the girl as soon as he is of age, or shoot himself. Up to town comes the squire and his wife and his daughter, and a lot of sentimentality, not in the slightest degree material to the present statement, takes places among them; and the upshot of it is that old Gatliffe is forced into withdrawing the word No, and substituting the word Yes. I don&#x27;t believe he would ever have done it, though, but for one lucky peculiarity in the case. The governess&#x27;s father was a man of good family--pretty nigh as good as Gatliffe&#x27;s own. He had been in the army; had sold out; set up as a wine-merchant--failed--died; ditto his wife, as to the dying part of it. No relation, in fact, left for the squire to make inquiries about but the father&#x27;s sister--who had behaved, as old Gatliffe said, like a thorough-bred gentlewoman in shutting the door against Mr. Frank in the first instance. So, to cut the matter short, things were at last made up pleasant enough. The time was fixed for the wedding, and an announcement about it--Marriage in High Life and all that--put into the county paper. There was a regular biography, besides, of the governess&#x27;s father, so as to stop people from talking--a great flourish about his pedigree, and a long account of his services in the army; but not a word, mind ye, of his having turned wine-merchant afterward. Oh, no--not a word about that! I knew it, though, for Mr. Frank told me. He hadn&#x27;t a bit of pride about him. He introduced me to his future wife one day when I met him out walking, and asked me if I did not think he was a lucky fellow. I don&#x27;t mind admitting that I did, and that I told him so. Ah! but she was one of my sort, was that governess. Stood, to the best of my recollection, five foot four. Good lissom figure, that looked as if it had never been boxed up in a pair of stays. Eyes that made me feel as if I was under a pretty stiff cross-examination the moment she looked at me. Fine red, kiss-and-come-again sort of lips. Cheeks and complexion--  No, Mr. Artist, you wouldn&#x27;t identify her by her cheeks and complexion, if I drew you a picture of them this very moment. She has had a family of children since the time I&#x27;m talking of; and her cheeks are a trifle fatter, and her complexion is a shade or two redder now, than when I first met her out walking with Mr. Frank. The marriage was to take place on a Wednesday. I decline mentioning the year or the month. I had started as an attorney on my own account--say six weeks, more or less, and was sitting alone in my office on the Monday morning before the wedding-day, trying to see my way clear before me and not succeeding particularly well, when Mr. Frank suddenly bursts in, as white as any ghost that ever was painted, and says he&#x27;s got the most dreadful case for me to advise on, and not an hour to lose in acting on my advice. &quot;Is this in the way of business, Mr. Frank?&quot; says I, stopping him just as he was beginning to get sentimental. &quot;Yes or no, Mr. Frank?&quot; rapping my new office paper-knife on the table, to pull him up short all the sooner. &quot;My dear fellow&quot;--he was always familiar with me--&quot;it&#x27;s in the way of business, certainly; but friendship--&quot; I was obliged to pull him up short again, and regularly examine him as if he had been in the witness-box, or he would have kept me talking to no purpose half the day. &quot;Now, Mr Frank,&quot; says I, &quot;I can&#x27;t have any sentimentality mixed up with business matters. You please to stop talking, and let me ask questions. Answer in the fewest words you can use. Nod when nodding will do instead of words.&quot; I fixed him with my eye for about three seconds, as he sat groaning and wriggling in his chair. When I&#x27;d done fixing him, I gave another rap with my paper-knife on the table to startle him up a bit. Then I went on. &quot;From what you have been stating up to the present time,&quot; says I, &quot;I gather that you are in a scrape which is likely to interfere seriously with your marriage on Wednesday?&quot; (He nodded, and I cut in again before he could say a word): &quot;The scrape affects your young lady, and goes back to the period of a transaction in which her late father was engaged, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot; (He nods, and I cut in once more): &quot;There is a party, who turned up after seeing the announcement of your marriage in the paper, who is cognizant of what he oughtn&#x27;t to know, and who is prepared to use his knowledge of the same to the prejudice of the young lady and of your marriage, unless he receives a sum of money to quiet him? Very well. Now, first of all, Mr. Frank, state what you have been told by the young lady herself about the transaction of her late father. How did you first come to have any knowledge of it?&quot; &quot;She was talking to me about her father one day so tenderly and prettily, that she quite excited my interest about him,&quot; begins Mr. Frank; &quot;and I asked her, among other things, what had occasioned his death. She said she believed it was distress of mind in the first instance; and added that this distress was connected with a shocking secret, which she and her mother had kept from everybody, but which she could not keep from me, because she was determined to begin her married life by having no secrets from her husband.&quot; Here Mr. Frank began to get sentimental again, and I pulled him up short once more with the paper-knife. &quot;She told me,&quot; Mr. Frank went on, &quot;that the great mistake of her father&#x27;s life was his selling out of the army and taking to the wine trade. He had no talent for business; things went wrong with him from the first. His clerk, it was strongly suspected, cheated him--&quot; &quot;Stop a bit,&quot; says I. &quot;What was that suspected clerk&#x27;s name?&quot; &quot;Davager,&quot; says he. &quot;Davager,&quot; says I, making a note of it. &quot;Go on, Mr. Frank.&quot; &quot;His affairs got more and more entangled,&quot; says Mr. Frank; &quot;he was pressed for money in all directions; bankruptcy, and consequent dishonor (as he considered it) stared him in the face. His mind was so affected by his troubles that both his wife and daughter, toward the last, considered him to be hardly responsible for his own acts. In this state of desperation and misery, he--&quot; Here Mr. Frank began to hesitate. We have two ways in the law of drawing  evidence off nice and clear from an unwilling client or witness. We give him a fright, or we treat him to a joke. I treated Mr. Frank to a joke. &quot;Ah!&quot; says I, &quot;I know what he did. He had a signature to write; and, by the most natural mistake in the world, he wrote another gentleman&#x27;s name instead of his own--eh?&quot; &quot;It was to a bill,&quot; says Mr. Frank, looking very crestfallen, instead of taking the joke. &quot;His principal creditor wouldn&#x27;t wait till he could raise the money, or the greater part of it. But he was resolved, if he sold off everything, to get the amount and repay--&quot; &quot;Of course,&quot; says I, &quot;drop that. The forgery was discovered. When?&quot; &quot;Before even the first attempt was made to negotiate the bill. He had done the whole thing in the most absurdly and innocently wrong way. The person whose name he had used was a stanch friend of his, and a relation of his wife&#x27;s--a good man as well as a rich one. He had influence with the chief creditor, and he used it nobly. He had a real affection for the unfortunate man&#x27;s wife, and he proved it generously.&quot; &quot;Come to the point,&quot; says I. &quot;What did he do? In a business way, what did he do?&quot; &quot;He put the false bill into the fire, drew a bill of his own to replace it, and then--only then--told my dear girl and her mother all that had happened. Can you imagine anything nobler?&quot; asks Mr. Frank. &quot;Speaking in my professional capacity, I can&#x27;t imagine anything greener,&quot; says I. &quot;Where was the father? Off, I suppose?&quot; &quot;Ill in bed,&quot; says Mr. Frank, coloring. &quot;But he mustered strength enough to write a contrite and grateful letter the same day, promising to prove himself worthy of the noble moderation and forgiveness extended to him, by selling off everything he possessed to repay his money debt. He did sell off everything, down to some old family pictures that were heirlooms; down to the little plate he had; down to the very tables and chairs that furnished his drawing-room. Every farthing of the debt was paid; and he was left to begin the world again, with the kindest promises of help from the generous man who had forgiven him. It was too late. His crime of one rash moment--atoned for tho ugh it had been--preyed upon his mind. He became possessed with the idea that he had lowered himself forever in the estimation of his wife and daughter, and--&quot; &quot;He died,&quot; I cut in. &quot;Yes, yes, we know that. Let&#x27;s go back for a minute to the contrite and grateful letter that he wrote. My experience in the law, Mr. Frank, has convinced me that if everybody burned everybody else&#x27;s letters, half the courts of justice in this country might shut up shop. Do you happen to know whether the letter we are now speaking of contained anything like an avowal or confession of the forgery?&quot; &quot;Of course it did,&quot; says he. &quot;Could the writer express his contrition properly without making some such confession?&quot; &quot;Quite easy, if he had been a lawyer,&quot; says I. &quot;But never mind that; I&#x27;m going to make a guess--a desperate guess, mind. Should I be altogether in error if I thought that this letter had been stolen; and that the fingers of Mr. Davager, of suspicious commercial celebrity, might possibly be the fingers which took it?&quot; &quot;That is exactly what I wanted to make you understand,&quot; cried Mr. Frank. &quot;How did he communicate the interesting fact of the theft to you?&quot; &quot;He has not ventured into my presence. The scoundrel actually had the audacity--&quot; &quot;Aha!&quot; says I. &quot;The young lady herself! Sharp practitioner, Mr. Davager.&quot; &quot;Early this morning, when she was walking alone in the shrubbery,&quot; Mr. Frank goes on, &quot;he had the assurance to approach her, and to say that he had been watching his opportunity of getting a private interview for days past. He then showed her--actually showed her--her unfortunate father&#x27;s letter; put into her hands another letter directed to me; bowed, and walked off; leaving her half dead with astonishment and terror. If I had only happened to be there at the time!&quot; says Mr. Frank, shaking his fist murderously in the air, by way of a finish. &quot;It&#x27;s the greatest luck in the world that you were not,&quot; says I. &quot;Have you got that other letter?&quot; He handed it to me. It was so remarkably humorous and short, that I remember every word of it at this distance of time. It began in this way: _&quot;To Francis Gatliffe, Esq., Jun._ &quot;SIR--I have an extremely curious autograph letter to sell. The price is a five-hundred-pound note. The young lady to whom you are to be married on Wednesday will inform you of the nature of the letter, and the genuineness of the autograph. If you refuse to deal, I shall send a copy to the local paper, and shall wait on your highly-respected father with the original curiosity, on the afternoon of Tuesday next. Having come down here on family business, I have put up at the family hotel--being to be heard of at the Gatliffe Arms. Your very obedient servant, ALFRED DAVAGER.&quot; &quot;A clever fellow that,&quot; says I, putting the letter into my private drawer. &quot;Clever!&quot; cries Mr. Frank, &quot;he ought to be horsewhipped within an inch of his life. I would have done it myself; but she made me promise, before she told me a word of the matter, to come straight to you.&quot; &quot;That was one of the wisest promises you ever made,&quot; says I. &quot;We can&#x27;t afford to bully this fellow, whatever else we may do with him. Do you think I am saying anything libelous against your excellent father&#x27;s character when I assert that if he saw the letter he would certainly insist on your marriage being put off, at the very least?&quot; &quot;Feeling as my father does about my marriage, he would insist on its being dropped altogether, if he saw this letter,&quot; says Mr. Frank, with a groan. &quot;But even that is not the worst of it. The generous, noble girl herself says that if the letter appears in the paper, with all the unanswerable comments this scoundrel would be sure to add to it, she would rather die than hold me to my engagement, even if my father would let me keep it.&quot; As he said this his eyes began to water. He was a weak young fellow, and ridiculously fond of her. I brought him back to business with another rap of the paper-knife. &quot;Hold up, Mr. Frank,&quot; says I. &quot;I have a question or two more. Did you think of asking the young lady whether, to the best of her knowledge, this infernal letter was the only written evidence of the forgery now in existence?&quot; &quot;Yes, I did think directly of asking her that,&quot; says he; &quot;and she told me she was quite certain that there was no written evidence of the forgery except that one letter.&quot; &quot;Will you give Mr. Davager his price for it?&quot; says I. &quot;Yes,&quot; says Mr. Frank, quite peevish with me for asking him such a question. He was an easy young chap in money matters, and talked of hundreds as most men talk of sixpences. &quot;Mr. Frank,&quot; says I, &quot;you came here to get my help and advice in this extremely ticklish business, and you are ready, as I know without asking, to remunerate me for all and any of my services at the usual professional rate. Now, I&#x27;ve made up my mind to act boldly--desperately, if you like--on the hit or miss, win all or lose all principle--in dealing with this matter. Here is my proposal. I&#x27;m going to try if I can&#x27;t do Mr. Davager out of his letter. If I don&#x27;t succeed before to-morrow afternoon, you hand him the money, and I charge you nothing for professional services. If I do succeed, I hand you the letter instead of Mr. Davager, and you give me the money instead of giving it to him. It&#x27;s a precious risk for me, but I&#x27;m ready to run it. You must pay your five hundred any way. What do you say to my plan? Is it Yes, Mr. Frank, or No?&quot; &quot;Hang your questions!&quot; cries Mr. Frank, jumping up; &quot;you know it&#x27;s Yes ten thousand times over. Only you earn the money and--&quot; &quot;And you will be too glad to give it to me. Very good. Now go home. Comfort the young lady--don&#x27;t let Mr. Davager so much as set eyes on you--keep quiet--leave everything to me--and feel as certain as you please that all the letters in the world can&#x27;t stop your being married on Wednesday.&quot; With these words I hustled him off out of the office, for I wanted to be left alone to make my mind up about what I should do. The first thing, of course, was to have a look at the enemy. I wrote to Mr. Davager, telling him that I was privately appointed to arrange the little business matter between himself and &quot;another party&quot; (no names!) on friendly terms; and begging him to call on me at his earliest convenience. At the very beginning of the case, Mr. Davager bothered me. His answer was, that it would not be convenient to him to call till between six and seven in the evening. In this way, you see, he contrived to make me lose several precious hours, at a time when minutes almost were of importance. I had nothing for it but to be patient, and to give certain instructions, before Mr. Davager came, to my boy Tom. There never was such a sharp boy of fourteen before, and there never will be again, as my boy Tom. A spy to look after Mr. Davager was, of course, the first requisite in a case of this kind; and Tom was the smallest, quickest, quietest, sharpest, stealthiest little snake of a chap that ever dogged a gentleman&#x27;s steps and kept cleverly out of range of a gentleman&#x27;s eyes. I settled it with the boy that he was not to show at all when Mr. Davager came; and that he was to wait to hear me ring the bell when Mr. Davager left. If I rang twice, he was to show the gentleman out. If I rang once, he was to keep out of the way, and follow the gentleman whereever he went till he got back to the inn. Those were the only preparations I could make to begin with; being obliged to wait, and let myself be guided by what turned up. About a quarter to seven my gentleman came. In the profession of the law we get somehow quite remarkably mixed up with ugly people, blackguard people, and dirty people. But far away the ugliest and dirtiest blackguard I ever saw in my life was Mr. Alfred Davager. He had greasy white hair and a mottled face. He was low in the forehead, fat in the stomach, hoarse in the voice, and weak in the legs. Both his eyes were bloodshot, and one was fixed in his head. He smelled of spirits, and carried a toothpick in his mouth. &quot;How are you? I&#x27;ve just done dinner,&quot; says he; and he lights a cigar, sits down with his legs crossed, and winks at me. I tried at first to take the measure of him i n a wheedling, confidential way; but it was no good. I asked him, in a facetious, smiling manner, how he had got hold of the letter. He only told me in answer that he had been in the confidential employment of the writer of it, and that he had always been famous since infancy for a sharp eye to his own interests. I paid him some compliments; but he was not to be flattered. I tried to make him lose his temper; but he kept it in spite of me. It ended in his driving me to my last resource--I made an attempt to frighten him. &quot;Before we say a word about the money,&quot; I began, &quot;let me put a case, Mr. Davager. The pull you have on Mr. Francis Gatliffe is, that you can hinder his marriage on Wednesday. Now, suppose I have got a magistrate&#x27;s warrant to apprehend you in my pocket? Suppose I have a constable to execute it in the next room? Suppose I bring you up to-morrow--the day before the marriage--charge you only generally with an attempt to extort money, and apply for a day&#x27;s remand to complete the case? Suppose, as a suspicious stranger, you can&#x27;t get bail in this town? Suppose--&quot; &quot;Stop a bit,&quot; says Mr. Davager. &quot;Suppose I should not be the greenest fool that ever stood in shoes? Suppose I should not carry the letter about me? Suppose I should have given a certain envelope to a certain friend of mine in a certain place in this town? Suppose the letter should be inside that envelope, directed to old Gatliffe, side by side with a copy of the letter directed to the editor of the local paper? Suppose my friend should be instructed to open the envelope, and take the letters to their right address, if I don&#x27;t appear to claim them from him this evening? In short, my dear sir, suppose you were born yesterday, and suppose I wasn&#x27;t?&quot; says Mr. Davager, and winks at me again. He didn&#x27;t take me by surprise, for I never expected that he had the letter about him. I made a pretense of being very much taken aback, and of being quite ready to give in. We settled our business about delivering the letter, and handing over the money, in no time. I was to draw out a document, which he was to sign. He knew the document was stuff and nonsense, just as well as I did, and told me I was only proposing it to swell my client&#x27;s bill. Sharp as he was, he was wrong there. The document was not to be drawn out to gain money from Mr. Frank, but to gain time from Mr. Davager. It served me as an excuse to put off the payment of the five hundred pounds till three o&#x27;clock on the Tuesday afternoon. The Tuesday morning Mr. Davager said he should devote to his amusement, and asked me what sights were to be seen in the neighborhood of the town. When I had told him, he pitched his toothpick into my grate, yawned, and went out. I rang the bell once--waited till he had passed the window--and then looked after Tom. There was my jewel of a boy on the opposite side of the street, just setting his top going in the most playful manner possible. Mr. Davager walked away up the street toward the market-place. Tom whipped his top up the street toward the market-place, too. In a quarter of an hour he came back, with all his evidence collected in a beautifully clear and compact state. Mr. Davager had walked to a public-house just outside the town, in a lane leading to the highroad. On a bench outside the public-house there sat a man smoking. He said &quot;All right?&quot; and gave a letter to Mr. Davager, who answered &quot;All right!&quot; and walked back to the inn. In the hall he ordered hot rum-and-water, cigars, slippers, and a fire to be lit in his room. After that he went upstairs, and Tom came away. I now saw my road clear before me--not very far on, but still clear. I had housed the letter, in all probability for that night, at the Gatliffe Arms. After tipping Tom, I gave him directions to play about the door of the inn, and refresh himself when he was tired at the tart-shop opposite, eating as much as he pleased, on the understanding that he crammed all the time with his eye on the window. If Mr. Davager went out, or Mr. Davager&#x27;s friend called on him, Tom was to let me know. He was also to take a little note from me to the head chambermaid--an old friend of mine--asking her to step over to my office, on a private matter of business, as soon as her work was done for that night. After settling these little matters, having half an hour to spare, I turned to and did myself a bloater at the office fire, and had a drop of gin-and-water hot, and felt comparatively happy. When the head chambermaid came, it turned out, as good luck would have it, that Mr. Davager had drawn her attention rather too closely to his ugliness, by offering her a testimony of his regard in the shape of a kiss. I no sooner mentioned him than she flew into a passion; and when I added, by way of clinching the matter, that I was retained to defend the interests of a very beautiful and deserving young lady (name not referred to, of course) against the most cruel underhand treachery on the part of Mr. Davager, the head chambermaid was ready to go any lengths that she could safely to serve my cause. In a few words I discovered that Boots was to call Mr. Davager at eight the next morning, and was to take his clothes downstairs to brush as usual. If Mr. D------ had not emptied his own pockets overnight, we arranged that Boots was to forget to empty them for him, and was to bring the clothes downstairs just as he found them. If Mr. D------&#x27;s pockets were emptied, then, of course, it would be necessary to transfer the searching process to Mr. D------&#x27;s room. Under any circumstances, I was certain of the head chambermaid; and under any circumstances, also, the head chambermaid was certain of Boots. I waited till Tom came home, looking very puffy and bilious about the face; but as to his intellects, if anything, rather sharper than ever. His report was uncommonly short and pleasant. The inn was shutting up; Mr. Davager was going to bed in rather a drunken condition; Mr. Davager&#x27;s friend had never appeared. I sent Tom (properly instructed about keeping our man in view all the next morning) to his shake-down behind the office-desk, where I heard him hiccoughing half the night, as even the best boys will, when over-excited and too full of tarts. At half-past seven next morning, I slipped quietly into Boots&#x27;s pantry. Down came the clothes. No pockets in trousers. Waistcoat-pockets empty. Coat-pockets with something in them. First, handkerchief; secondly, bunch of keys; thirdly, cigar-case; fourthly, pocketbook. Of course I wasn&#x27;t such a fool as to expect to find the letter there, but I opened the pocketbook with a certain curiosity, notwithstanding. Nothing in the two pockets of the book but some old advertisements cut out of newspapers, a lock of hair tied round with a dirty bit of ribbon, a circular letter about a loan society, and some copies of verses not likely to suit any company that was not of an extremely free-and-easy description. On the leaves of the pocketbook, people&#x27;s addresses scrawled in pencil, and bets jotted down in red ink. On one leaf, by itself, this queer inscription: &quot;MEM. 5 ALONG. 4 ACROSS.&quot; I understood everything but those words and figures, so of course I copied them out into my own book. Then I waited in the pantry till Boots had brushed the clothes, and had taken them upstairs. His report when he came down was, that Mr. D------ had asked if it was a fine morning. Being told that it was, he had ordered breakfast at nine, and a saddle-horse to be at the door at ten, to take him to Grimwith Abbey--one of the sights in our neighborhood which I had told him of the evening before. &quot;I&#x27;ll be here, coming in by the back way, at half-past ten,&quot; says I to the head chambermaid. &quot;What for?&quot; says she. &quot;To take the responsibility of making Mr. Davager&#x27;s bed off your hands for this morning only,&quot; says I. &quot;Any more orders?&quot; says she. &quot;One more,&quot; says I. &quot;I want to hire Sam for the morning. Put it down in the order-book that he&#x27;s to be brought round to my office at ten.&quot; In case you should think Sam was a man, I&#x27;d better perhaps tell you he was a pony. I&#x27;d made up my mind that it would be beneficial to Tom&#x27;s health, after the  tarts, if he took a constitutional airing on a nice hard saddle in the direction of Grimwith Abbey. &quot;Anything else?&quot; says the head chambermaid. &quot;Only one more favor,&quot; says I. &quot;Would my boy Tom be very much in the way if he came, from now till ten, to help with the boots and shoes, and stood at his work close by this window which looks out on the staircase?&quot; &quot;Not a bit,&quot; says the head chambermaid. &quot;Thank you,&quot; says I; and stepped back to my office directly. When I had sent Tom off to help with the boots and shoes, I reviewed the whole case exactly as it stood at that time. There were three things Mr. Davager might do with the letter. He might give it to his friend again before ten--in which case Tom would most likely see the said friend on the stairs. He might take it to his friend, or to some other friend, after ten--in which case Tom was ready to follow him on Sam the pony. And, lastly, he might leave it hidden somewhere in his room at the inn--in which case I was all ready for him with a search-warrant of my own granting, under favor always of my friend the head chambermaid. So far I had my business arrangements all gathered up nice and compact in my own hands. Only two things bothered me; the terrible shortness of the time at my disposal, in case I failed in my first experiments, for getting hold of the letter, and that queer inscription which I had copied out of the pocketbook: &quot;MEM. 5 ALONG. 4 ACROSS.&quot; It was the measurement most likely of something, and he was afraid of forgetting it; therefore it was something important. Query--something about himself? Say &quot;5&quot; (inches) &quot;along&quot;--he doesn&#x27;t wear a wig. Say &quot;5&quot; (feet) &quot;along&quot;--it can&#x27;t be coat, waistcoat, trousers, or underclothing. Say &quot;5&quot; (yards) &quot;along&quot;--it can&#x27;t be anything about himself, unless he wears round his body the rope that he&#x27;s sure to be hanged with one of these days. Then it is _not_ something about himself. What do I know of that is important to him besides? I know of nothing but the Letter. Can the memorandum be connected with that? Say, yes. What do &quot;5 along&quot; and &quot;4 across&quot; mean, then? The measurement of something he carries about with him? or the measurement of something in his room? I could get pretty satisfactorily to myself as far as that; but I could get no further. Tom came back to the office, and reported him mounted for his ride. His friend had never appeared. I sent the boy off, with his proper instructions, on Sam&#x27;s back--wrote an encouraging letter to Mr. Frank to keep him quiet--then slipped into the inn by the back way a little before half-past ten. The head chambermaid gave me a signal when the landing was clear. I got into his room without a soul but her seeing me, and locked the door immediately. The case was, to a certain extent, simplified now. Either Mr. Davager had ridden out with the letter about him, or he had left it in some safe hiding-place in his room. I suspected it to be in his room, for a reason that will a little astonish you--his trunk, his dressing-case, and all the drawers and cupboards, were left open. I knew my customer, and I thought this extraordinary carelessness on his part rather suspicious. Mr. Davager had taken one of the best bedrooms at the Gatliffe Arms. Floor carpeted all over, walls beautifully papered, four-poster, and general furniture first-rate. I searched, to begin with, on the usual plan, examining everything in every possible way, and taking more than an hour about it. No discovery. Then I pulled out a carpenter&#x27;s rule which I had brought with me. Was there anything in the room which--either in inches, feet, or yards--answered to &quot;5 along&quot; and &quot;4 across&quot;? Nothing. I put the rule back in my pocket--measurement was no good, evidently. Was there anything in the room that would count up to 5 one way and 4 another, seeing that nothing would measure up to it? I had got obstinately persuaded by this time that the letter must be in the room--principally because of the trouble I had had in looking after it. And persuading myself of that, I took it into my head next, just as obstinately, that &quot;5 along&quot; and &quot;4 across&quot; must be the right clew to find the letter by--principally because I hadn&#x27;t left myself, after all my searching and thinking, even so much as the ghost of another guide to go by. &quot;Five along&quot;--where could I count five along the room, in any part of it? Not on the paper. The pattern there was pillars of trellis-work and flowers, inclosing a plain green ground--only four pillars along the wall and only two across. The furniture? There were not five chairs or five separate pieces of any furniture in the room altogether. The fringes that hung from the cornice of the bed? Plenty of them, at any rate! Up I jumped on the counterpane, with my pen-knife in my hand. Every way that &quot;5 along&quot; and &quot;4 across&quot; could be reckoned on those unlucky fringes I reckoned on them--probed with my penknife--scratched with my nails--crunched with my fingers. No use; not a sign of a letter; and the time was getting on--oh, Lord! how the time did get on in Mr. Davager&#x27;s room that morning. I jumped down from the bed, so desperate at my ill luck that I hardly cared whether anybody heard me or not. Quite a little cloud of dust rose at my feet as they thumped on the carpet. &quot;Hullo!&quot; thought I, &quot;my friend the head chambermaid takes it easy here. Nice state for a carpet to be in, in one of the best bedrooms at the Gatliffe Arms.&quot; Carpet! I had been jumping up on the bed, and staring up at the walls, but I had never so much as given a glance down at the carpet. Think of me pretending to be a lawyer, and not knowing how to look low enough! The carpet! It had been a stout article in its time, had evidently began in a drawing-room; then descended to a coffee-room; then gone upstairs altogether to a bedroom. The ground was brown, and the pattern was bunches of leaves and roses speckled over the ground at regular distances. I reckoned up the bunches. Ten along the room--eight across it. When I had stepped out five one way and four the other, and was down on my knees on the center bunch, as true as I sit on this chair I could hear my own heart beating so loud that it quite frightened me. I looked narrowly all over the bunch, and I felt all over it with the ends of my fingers, and nothing came of that. Then I scraped it over slowly and gently with my nails. My second finger-nail stuck a little at one place. I parted the pile of the carpet over that place, and saw a thin slit which had been hidden by the pile being smoothed over it--a slit about half an inch long, with a little end of brown thread, exactly the color of the carpet ground, sticking out about a quarter of an inch from the middle of it. Just as I laid hold of the thread gently, I heard a footstep outside the door. It was only the head chamber-maid. &quot;Haven&#x27;t you done yet?&quot; she whispers. &quot;Give me two minutes,&quot; says I, &quot;and don&#x27;t let anybody come near the door--whatever you do, don&#x27;t let anybody startle me again by coming near the door.&quot; I took a little pull at the thread, and heard something rustle. I took a longer pull, and out came a piece of paper, rolled up tight like those candle-lighters that the ladies make. I unrolled it--and, by George! there was the letter! The original letter! I knew it by the color of the ink. The letter that was worth five hundred pounds to me! It was all that I could do to keep myself at first from throwing my hat into the air, and hurrahing like mad. I had to take a chair and sit quiet in it for a minute or two, before I could cool myself down to my proper business level. I knew that I was safely down again when I found myself pondering how to let Mr. Davager know that he had been done by the innocent country attorney, after all. It was not long before a nice little irritating plan occurred to me. I tore a blank leaf out of my pocketbook, wrote on it with my pencil, &quot;Change for a five-hundred-pound note,&quot; folded up the paper, tied the thread to it, poked it back into the hiding-place, smoothed over the pile of the carpet, and then bolted off to Mr. Frank. He in his turn bolted off to show the letter to the young lady, who first certified to its genuineness, then dropped it into the fire, and then took the initiative for the first time since her marriage engagement, by flinging her arms round his neck, kissing him with all her might, and going into hysterics in his arms. So at least Mr. Frank told me, but that&#x27;s not evidence. It is evidence, however, that I saw them married with my own eyes on the Wednesday; and that while they went off in a carriage-and-four to spend the honeymoon, I went off on my own legs to open a credit at the Town and County Bank with a five-hundred-pound note in my pocket. As to Mr. Davager, I can tell you nothing more about him, except what is derived from hearsay evidence, which is always unsatisfactory evidence, even in a lawyer&#x27;s mouth. My inestimable boy, Tom, although twice kicked off by Sam the pony, never lost hold of the bridle, and kept his man in sight from first to last. He had nothing particular to report except that on the way out to the Abbey Mr. Davager had stopped at the public-house, had spoken a word or two to his friend of the night before, and had handed him what looked like a bit of paper. This was no doubt a clew to the thread that held the letter, to be used in case of accidents. In every other respect Mr. D. had ridden out and ridden in like an ordinary sightseer. Tom reported him to me as having dismounted at the hotel about two. At half-past I locked my office door, nailed a card under the knocker with &quot;not at home till to-morrow&quot; written on it, and retired to a friend&#x27;s house a mile or so out of the town for the rest of the day. Mr. Davager, I have been since given to understand, left the Gatliffe Arms that same night with his best clothes on his back, and with all the valuable contents of his dressing-case in his pockets. I am not in a condition to state whether he ever went through the form of asking for his bill or not; but I can positively testify that he never paid it, and that the effects left in his bedroom did not pay it either. When I add to these fragments of evidence that he and I have never met (luckily for me, you will say) since I jockeyed him out of his banknote, I have about fulfilled my implied contract as maker of a statement with you, sir, as hearer of a statement. Observe the expression, will you? I said it was a Statement before I began; and I say it&#x27;s a Statement now I&#x27;ve done. I defy you to prove it&#x27;s a Story! How are you getting on with my portrait? I like you very well, Mr. Artist; but if you have been taking advantage of my talking to shirk your work, as sure as you&#x27;re alive I&#x27;ll split upon you to the Town Council! I attended a great many times at my queer sitter&#x27;s house before his likeness was completed. To the last he was dissatisfied with the progress I made. Fortunately for me, the Town Council approved of the portrait when it was done. Mr. Boxsious, however, objected to them as being much too easy to please. He did not dispute the fidelity of the likeness, but he asserted that I had not covered the canvas with half paint enough for my money. To this day (for he is still alive), he describes me to all inquiring friends as &quot;The Painter-Man who jockeyed the Town Council.&quot; PROLOGUE TO THE THIRD STORY. IT was a sad day for me when Mr. Lanfray, of Rockleigh Place, discovering that his youngest daughter&#x27;s health required a warm climate, removed from his English establishment to the South of France. Roving from place to place, as I am obliged to do, though I make many acquaintances, I keep but few friends. The nature of my calling is, I am quite aware, mainly answerable for this. People cannot be blamed for forgetting a man who, on leaving their houses, never can tell them for certain when he is likely to be in their neighborhood again. Mr. Lanfray was one of the few exceptional persons who always remembered me. I have proofs of his friendly interest in my welfare in the shape of letters which I treasure with grateful care. The last of these is an invitation to his house in the South of France. There is little chance at present of my being able to profit by his kindness; but I like to read his invitation from time to time, for it makes me fancy, in my happier moments, that I may one day really be able to accept it. My introduction to this gentleman, in my capacity of portrait-painter, did not promise much for me in a professional point of view. I was invited to Rockleigh--or to &quot;The Place,&quot; as it was more frequently called among the people of the county--to take a likeness in water-colors, on a small scale, of the French governess who lived with Mr. Lanfray&#x27;s daughters. My first idea on hearing of this was, that the governess was about to leave her situation, and that her pupils wished to have a memorial of her in the shape of a portrait. Subsequent inquiry, however, informed me that I was in error. It was the eldest of Mr. Lanfray&#x27;s daughters, who was on the point of leaving the house to accompany her husband to India; and it was for her that the portrait had been ordered as a home remembrance of her best and dearest friend. Besides these particulars, I discovered that the governess, though still called &quot;mademoiselle,&quot; was an old lady; that Mr. Lanfray had been introduced to her many years since in France, after the death of his wife; that she was absolute mistress in the house; and that her three pupils had always looked up to her as a second mother, from the time when their father first placed them under her charge. These scraps of information made me rather anxious to see Mademoiselle Clairfait, the governess. On the day appointed for my attendance at the comfortable country house of Rockleigh, I was detained on the road, and did not arrive at my destination until late in the evening. The welcome accorded to me by Mr. Lanfray gave an earnest of the unvarying kindness that I was to experience at his hands in after-life. I was received at once on equal terms, as if I had been a friend of the family, and was presented the same evening to my host&#x27;s daughters. They were not merely three elegant and attractive young women, but--what means much more than that--three admirable subjects for pictures, the bride particularly. Her young husband did not strike me much at first sight; he seemed rather shy and silent. After I had been introduced to him, I looked round for Mademoiselle Clairfait, but she was not present; and I was soon afterward informed by Mr. Lanfray that she always spent the latter part of the evening in her own room. At the breakfast-table the next morning, I again looked for my sitter, and once more in vain. &quot;Mamma, as we call her,&quot; said one of the ladies, &quot;is dressing expressly for her picture, Mr. Kerby. I hope you are not above painting silk, lace, and jewelry. The dear old lady, who is perfection in everything else, is perfection also in dress, and is bent on being painted in all her splendor.&quot; This explanation prepared me for something extraordinary; but I found that my anticipations had fallen far below the reality when Mademoiselle Clairfait at last made her appearance, and announced that she was ready to sit for her portrait. Never before or since have I seen such perfect dressing and such active old age in combination. &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; was short and thin; her face was perfectly white all over, the skin being puckered up in an infinite variety of the smallest possible wrinkles. Her bright black eyes were perfect marvels of youthfulness and vivacity. They sparkled, and beamed, and ogled, and moved about over everybody and everything at such a rate, that the plain gray hair above them looked unnaturally venerable, and the wrinkles below an artful piece of masquerade to represent old age. As for her dress, I remember few harder pieces of work than the painting of it. She wore a silver-gray silk gown that seemed always flashing out into some new light whenever she moved. It was as stiff as a board, and rustled like the wind. Her head, neck, and bosom were enveloped in clouds of the airiest-looking lace I ever saw, disposed about each part of her with the most exquisite grace and propriety, and glistening at all sorts of unexpected places with little fairy-like toys in go ld and precious stones. On her right wrist she wore three small bracelets, with the hair of her three pupils worked into them; and on her left, one large bracelet with a miniature let in over the clasp. She had a dark crimson and gold scarf thrown coquettishly over her shoulders, and held a lovely little feather-fan in her hand. When she first presented herself before me in this costume, with a brisk courtesy and a bright smile, filling the room with perfume, and gracefully flirting the feather-fan, I lost all confidence in my powers as a portrait-painter immediately. The brightest colors in my box looked dowdy and dim, and I myself felt like an unwashed, unbrushed, unpresentable sloven. &quot;Tell me, my angels,&quot; said mademoiselle, apostrophizing her pupils in the prettiest foreign English, &quot;am I the cream of all creams this morning? Do I carry my sixty years resplendently? Will the savages in India, when my own love exhibits my picture among them, say, &#x27;Ah! smart! smart! this was a great dandy?&#x27; And the gentleman, the skillful artist, whom it is even more an honor than a happiness to meet, does he approve of me for a model? Does he find me pretty and paintable from top to toe?&quot; Here she dropped me another brisk courtesy, placed herself in a languishing position in the sitter&#x27;s chair, and asked us all if she looked like a shepherdess in Dresden china. The young ladies burst out laughing, and mademoiselle, as gay as any of them and a great deal shriller, joined in the merriment. Never before had I contended with any sitter half as restless as that wonderful old lady. No sooner had I begun than she jumped out of the chair, and exclaiming, &quot;_Grand Dieu!_ I have forgotten to embrace my angels this morning,&quot; ran up to her pupils, raised herself on tiptoe before them in quick succession, put the two first fingers of each hand under their ears, kissed them lightly on both cheeks, and was back again in the chair before an English governess could have said, &quot;Good-morning, my dears, I hope you all slept well last night.&quot; I began again. Up jumped mademoiselle for the second time, and tripped across the room to a cheval-glass. &quot;No!&quot; I heard her say to herself, &quot;I have not discomposed my head in kissing my angels. I may come back and pose for my picture.&quot; Back she came. I worked from her for five minutes at the most. &quot;Stop!&quot; cries mademoiselle, jumping up for the third time; &quot;I must see how this skillful artist is getting on. _Grand Dieu!_! why he has done nothing!&quot; For the fourth time I began, and for the fourth time the old lady started out of her chair. &quot;Now I must repose myself,&quot; said mademoiselle, walking lightly from end to end of the room, and humming a French air, by way of taking a rest. I was at my wit&#x27;s end, and the young ladies saw it. They all surrounded my unmanageable sitter, and appealed to her compassion for me. &quot;Certainly!&quot; said mademoiselle, expressing astonishment by flinging up both her hands with all the fingers spread out in the air. &quot;But why apostrophize me thus? I am here, I am ready, I am at the service of this skillful artist. Why apostrophize me?&quot; A fortunate chance question of mine steadied her for some time. I inquired if I was expected to draw the whole of my sitter&#x27;s figure as well as her face. Mademoiselle replied by a comic scream of indignation. If I was the brave and gifted man for whom she took me, I ought to be ready to perish rather than leave out an inch of her anywhere. Dress was her passion, and it would be an outrage on her sentiments if I did not do full justice to everything she had on--to her robe, to her lace, to her scarf, to her fan, to her rings, her jewels, and, above all, to her bracelets. I groaned in spirit at the task before me, but made my best bow of acquiescence. Mademoiselle was not to be satisfied by a mere bow; she desired the pleasure of specially directing my attention, if I would be so amiable as to get up and approach her, to one of her bracelets in particular--the bracelet with the miniature, on her left wrist. It had been the gift of the dearest friend she ever had, and the miniature represented that friend&#x27;s beloved and beautiful face. Could I make a tiny, tiny copy of that likeness in my drawing! Would I only be so obliging as to approach for one little moment, and see if such a thing were possible? I obeyed unwillingly enough, expecting, from mademoiselle&#x27;s expression, to see a commonplace portrait of some unfortunate admirer whom she had treated with unmerited severity in the days of her youth. To my astonishment, I found that the miniature, which was very beautifully painted, represented a woman&#x27;s face--a young woman with kind, sad eyes, pale, delicate cheeks, light hair, and such a pure, tender, lovely expressions that I thought of Raphael&#x27;s Madonnas the moment I looked at her portrait. The old lady observed the impression which the miniature produced on me, and nodded her head in silence. &quot;What a beautiful, innocent, pure face!&quot; I said. Mademoiselle Clairfait gently brushed a particle of dust from the miniature with her handkerchief, and kissed it. &quot;I have three angels still left,&quot; she said, looking at her pupils. &quot;They console me for the fourth, who has gone to heaven.&quot; She patted the face on the miniature gently with her little, withered, white fingers, as if it had been a living thing. _&quot;Sister Rose!&quot;_ she sighed to herself; then, looking up again at me, said, &quot;I should like it put into my portrait, sir, because I have always worn it since I was a young woman, for &#x27;Sister Rose&#x27;s&#x27; sake.&quot; The sudden change in her manner, from the extreme of flighty gayety to the extreme of quiet sadness, would have looked theatrical in a woman of any other nation. It seemed, however, perfectly natural and appropriate in her. I went back to my drawing, rather perplexed. Who was &quot;Sister Rose&quot;? Not one of the Lanfray family, apparently. The composure of the young ladies when the name was mentioned showed plainly enough that the original of the miniature had been no relation of theirs. I tried to stifle my curiosity on the subject of Sister Rose, by giving myself entirely to my work. For a full half-hour, Mademoiselle Clairfait sat quietly before me, with her hands crossed on her lap, and her eyes fixed on the bracelet. This happy alteration enabled me to do something toward completing the outline of her face and figure. I might even, under fortunate circumstances, have vanquished the preliminary difficulties of my task at one effort; but the fates were against me that day. While I was still working rapidly and to my satisfaction, a servant knocked at the door to announce luncheon, and mademoiselle lightly roused herself from her serious reflection and her quiet position in a moment. &quot;Ah me!&quot; she said, turning the miniature round on her wrist till it was out of sight. &quot;What animals we are, after all! The spiritual part of us is at the mercy of the stomach. My heart is absorbed by tender thoughts, yet I am not the less ready for luncheon! Come, my children and fellow-mortals. _Allons cultiver notre jardin!&quot;_ With this quotation from &quot;Candide,&quot; plaintively delivered, the old lady led the way out of the room, and was followed by her younger pupils. The eldest sister remained behind for a moment, and reminded me that the lunch was ready. &quot;I am afraid you have found the dear old soul rather an unruly sitter,&quot; she said, noticing the look of dissatisfaction with which I was regarding my drawing. &quot;But she will improve as you go on. She has done better already for the last half-hour, has she not?&quot; &quot;Much better,&quot; I answered. &quot;My admiration of the miniature on the bracelet seemed--I suppose, by calling up some old associations--to have a strangely soothing effect on Mademoiselle Clairfait.&quot; &quot;Ah yes! only remind her of the original of that portrait, and you change her directly, whatever she may have been saying or doing the moment before. Sometimes she talks of _Sister Rose,_ and of all that she went through in the time of the French Revolution, by the hour together. It is wonderfully interesting--at least we all think so. &quot; &quot;I presume that the lady described as &#x27;Sister Rose&#x27; was  a relation of  Mademoiselle Clairfait&#x27;s?&quot; &quot;No, only a very dear friend. Mademoiselle Clairfait is the daughter of a silk-mercer, once established at Chalons-sur-Marne. Her father happened to give an asylum in his office to a lonely old man, to whom &#x27;Sister Rose&#x27; and her brother had been greatly indebted in the revolutionary time; and out of a train of circumstances connected with that, the first acquaintance between mademoiselle and the friend whose portrait she wears, arose. After the time of her father&#x27;s bankruptcy, and for many years before we were placed under her charge, our good old governess lived entirely with &#x27;Sister Rose&#x27; and her brother. She must then have heard all the interesting things that she has since often repeated to my sisters and myself.&quot; &quot;Might I suggest,&quot; said I, after an instant&#x27;s consideration, &quot;that the best way to give me a fair chance of studying Mademoiselle Clairfait&#x27;s face at the next sitting, would be to lead her thoughts again to that quieting subject of the miniature, and to the events which the portrait recalls? It is really the only plan, after what I have observed this morning, that I can think of for enabling me to do myself and my sitter justice.&quot; &quot;I am delighted to hear you say so,&quot; replied the lady; &quot;for the execution of your plan, by me or by my sisters, will be the easiest thing in the world. A word from us at any time will set mademoiselle thinking, and talking too, of the friend of her youthful days. Depend on our assistance so far. And now let me show you the way to the luncheon-table.&quot; Two good results followed the ready rendering of the help I had asked from my host&#x27;s daughters. I succeeded with my portrait of Mademoiselle Clairfait, and I heard the story which occupies the following pages. In the case of the preceding narratives, I have repeated what was related to me, as nearly as possible in the very words of my sitters. In the case of this third story, it is impossible for me to proceed upon the same plan. The circumstances of &quot;Sister Rose&#x27;s&quot; eventful history were narrated to me at different times, and in the most fragmentary and discursive manner. Mademoiselle Clairfait characteristically mixed up with the direct interest of her story, not only references to places and people which had no recognizable connection with it, but outbursts of passionate political declamation, on the extreme liberal side--to say nothing of little tender apostrophes to her beloved friend, which sounded very prettily as she spoke them, but which would lose their effect altogether by being transferred to paper. Under these circumstances, I have thought it best to tell the story in my own way--rigidly adhering to the events of it exactly as they were related; and never interfering on my own responsibility except to keep order in the march of the incidents, and to present them, to the best of my ability, variously as well as interestingly to the reader. THE FRENCH GOVERNESS&#x27;S STORY OF SISTER ROSE. PART FIRST. CHAPTER I. &quot;WELL, Monsieur Guillaume, what is the news this evening?&quot; &quot;None that I know of, Monsieur Justin, except that Mademoiselle Rose is to be married tomorrow. &quot; &quot;Much obliged, my respectable old friend, for so interesting and unexpected a reply to my question. Considering that I am the valet of Monsieur Danville, who plays the distinguished part of bridegroom in the little wedding comedy to which you refer, I think I may assure you, without offense, that your news is, so far as I am concerned, of the stalest possible kind. Take a pinch of snuff, Monsieur Guillaume, and excuse me if I inform you that my question referred to public news, and not to the private affairs of the two families whose household interests we have the pleasure of promoting.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t understand what you mean by such a phrase as promoting household interests, Monsieur Justin. I am the servant of Monsieur Louis Trudaine, who lives here with his sister, Mademoiselle Rose. You are the servant of Monsieur Danville, whose excellent mother has made up the match for him with my young lady. As servants, both of us, the pleasantest news we can have any concern with is news that is connected with the happiness of our masters. I have nothing to do with public affairs; and, being one of the old school, I make it my main object in life to mind my own business. If our homely domestic politics have no interests for you, allow me to express my regret, and to wish you a very good-evening.&quot; &quot;Pardon me, my dear sir, I have not the slightest respect for the old school, or the least sympathy with people who only mind their own business. However, I accept your expressions of regret; I reciprocate your &#x27;Good-evening&#x27;; and I trust to find you improved in temper, dress, manners, and appearance the next time I have the honor of meeting you. Adieu, Monsieur Guillaume, and! _Vive la bagatelle!&quot;_ These scraps of dialogue were interchanged on a lovely summer evening in the year seventeen hundred and eighty-nine, before the back door of a small house which stood on the banks of the Seine, about three miles westward of the city of Rouen. The one speaker was lean, old, crabbed and slovenly; the other was plump, young, oily-mannered and dressed in the most gorgeous livery costume of the period. The last days of genuine dandyism were then rapidly approaching all over the civilized world; and Monsieur Justin was, in his own way, dressed to perfection, as a living illustration of the expiring glories of his epoch. After the old servant had left him, he occupied himself for a few minutes in contemplating, superciliously enough, the back view of the little house before which he stood. Judging by the windows, it did not contain more than six or eight rooms in all. Instead of stables and outhouses, there was a conservatory attached to the building on one side, and a low, long room, built of wood, gayly painted, on the other. One of the windows of this room was left uncurtained and through it could be seen, on a sort of dresser inside, bottles filled with strangely-colored liquids oddly-shaped utensils of brass and copper, one end of a large furnace, and other objects, which plainly proclaimed that the apartment was used as a chemical laboratory. &quot;Think of our bride&#x27;s brother amusing himself in such a place as that with cooking drugs in saucepans,&quot; muttered Monsieur Justin, peeping into the room. &quot;I am the least particular man in the universe, but I must say I wish we were not going to be connected by marriage with an amateur apothecary. Pah! I can smell the place through the window.&quot; With these words Monsieur Justin turned his back on the laboratory in disgust, and sauntered toward the cliffs overhanging the river. Leaving the garden attached to the house, he ascended some gently rising ground by a winding path. Arrived at the summit, the whole view of the Seine, with its lovely green islands, its banks fringed with trees, its gliding boats, and little scattered water-side cottages, opened before him. Westward, where the level country appeared beyond the further bank of the river, the landscape was all aglow with the crimson of the setting sun. Eastward, the long shadows and mellow intervening lights, the red glory that quivered on the rippling water, the steady ruby fire glowing on cottage windows that reflected the level sunlight, led the eye onward and onward, along the windings of the Seine, until it rested upon the spires, towers, and broadly-massed houses of Rouen, with the wooded hills rising beyond them for background. Lovely to look on at any time, the view was almost supernaturally beautiful now under the gorgeous evening light that glowed up in it. All its attractions, however, were lost on the valet; he stood yawning with his hands in his pockets, looking neither to the right nor to the left, but staring straight before him at a little hollow, beyond which the ground sloped away smoothly to the brink of the cliff. A bench was placed here, and three persons--an old lady, a gentleman, and a young girl--were seated on it, watching the sunset, and by consequence turning their backs on Monsieur Justin. Near them stood two gentlemen, also looking toward th e liver and the distant view. These five figures attracted the valet&#x27;s attention, to the exclusion of every other object around him. &quot;There they are still,&quot; he said to himself, discontentedly. &quot;Madame Danville in the same place on the seat; my master, the bridegroom, dutifully next to her; Mademoiselle Rose, the bride, bashfully next to him; Monsieur Trudaine, the amateur apothecary brother, affectionately next to her; and Monsieur Lomaque, our queer land-steward, officially in waiting on the whole party. There they all are indeed, incomprehensibly wasting their time still in looking at nothing! Yes,&quot; continued Monsieur Justin, lifting his eyes wearily, and staring hard, first up the river at Rouen, then down the river at the setting sun; &quot;yes, plague take them! looking at nothing, absolutely and positively at nothing, all this while.&quot; Here Monsieur Justin yawned again, and, returning to the garden, sat himself down in an arbor and resignedly went to sleep. If the valet had ventured near the five persons whom he had been apostrophizing from a distance, and if he had been possessed of some little refinement of observation, he could hardly have failed to remark that the bride and bridegroom of the morrow, and their companions on either side, were all, in a greater or less degree, under the influence of some secret restraint, which affected their conversation, their gestures, and even the expression of their faces. Madame Danville--a handsome, richly-dressed old lady, with very bright eyes, and a quick, suspicious manner--looked composedly and happily enough, as long as her attention was fixed on her son. But when she turned from him toward the bride, a hardly perceptible uneasiness passed over her face--an uneasiness which only deepened to positive distrust and dissatisfaction whenever she looked toward Mademoiselle Trudaine&#x27;s brother. In the same way, her son, who was all smiles and happiness while he was speaking with his future wife, altered visibly in manner and look exactly as his mother altered, whenever the presence of Monsieur Trudaine specially impressed itself on his attention. Then, again, Lomaque, the land-steward--quiet, sharp, skinny Lomaque, with the submissive manner, and the red-rimmed eyes--never looked up at his master&#x27;s future brother-in-law without looking away again rather uneasily, and thoughtfully drilling holes in the grass with his long sharp-pointed cane. Even the bride herself--the pretty, innocent girl, with her childish shyness of manner--seemed to be affected like the others. Doubt, if not distress, overshadowed her face from time to time, and the hand which her lover held trembled a little, and grew restless, when she accidentally caught her brother&#x27;s eye. Strangely enough there was nothing to repel, but, on the contrary, everything to attract in the look and manner of the person whose mere presence seemed to exercise such a curiously constraining influence over the wedding- party. Louis Trudaine was a remarkably handsome man. His expression was singularly kind and gentle; his manner irresistibly winning in its frank, manly firmness and composure. His words, when he occasionally spoke, seemed as unlikely to give offense as his looks; for he only opened his lips in courteous reply to questions directly addressed to him. Judging by a latent mournfulness in the tones of his voice, and by the sorrowful tenderness which clouded his kind, earnest eyes whenever they rested on his sister, his thoughts were certainly not of the happy or the hopeful kind. But he gave them no direct expression; he intruded his secret sadness, whatever it might be, on no one of his companions. Nevertheless, modest and self-restrained as he was, there was evidently some reproving or saddening influence in his presence which affected the spirits of every one near him, and darkened the eve of the wedding to bride and bridegroom alike. As the sun slowly sank in the heavens, the conversation flagged more and more. After a long silence, the bridegroom was the first to start a new subject. &quot;Rose, love,&quot; he said, &quot;that magnificent sunset is a good omen for our marriage; it promises another lovely day to-morrow.&quot; The bride laughed and blushed. &quot;Do you really believe in omens, Charles?&quot; she said. &quot;My dear,&quot; interposed the old lady, before her son could answer, &quot;if Charles does believe in omens, it is nothing to laugh at. You will soon know better, when you are his wife, than to confound him, even in the slightest things, with the common herd of people. All his convictions are well founded--so well, that if I thought he really did believe in omens, I should most assuredly make up my mind to believe in them too.&quot; &quot;I beg your pardon, madame,&quot; Rose began, tremulously, &quot;I only meant--&quot; &quot;My dear child, have you so little knowledge of the world as to suppose that I could be offended--&quot; &quot;Let Rose speak,&quot; said the young man. He turned round petulantly, almost with the air of a spoiled child, to his mother, as he said those words. She had been looking fondly and proudly on him the moment before. Now her eyes wandered disconcertedly from his face; she hesitated an instant with a sudden confusion which seemed quite foreign to her character, then whispered in his ear, &quot;Am I to blame, Charles, for trying to make her worthy of you?&quot; Her son took no notice of the question. He only reiterated sharply, &quot;Let Rose speak.&quot; &quot;I really had nothing to say,&quot; faltered the young girl, growing more and more confused. &quot;Oh, but you had!&quot; There was such an ungracious sharpness in his voice, such an outburst of petulance in his manner as he spoke, that his mother gave him a warning touch on the arm, and whispered &quot;Hush!&quot; Monsieur Lomaque, the land-steward, and Monsieur Trudaine, the brother, both glanced searchingly at the bride, as the words passed the bridegroom&#x27;s lips. She seemed to be frightened and astonished, rather than irritated or hurt. A curious smile puckered up Lomaque&#x27;s lean face, as he looked demurely down on the ground, and began drilling a fresh hole in the turf with the sharp point of his cane. Trudaine turned aside quickly, and, sighing, walked away a few paces; then came back, and seemed about to speak, but Danville interrupted him. &quot;Pardon me, Rose,&quot; he said; &quot;I am so jealous of even the appearance of any want of attention toward you, that I was nearly allowing myself to be irritated about nothing.&quot; He kissed her hand very gracefully and tenderly as he made his excuse; but there was a latent expression in his eye which was at variance with the apparent spirit of his action. It was noticed by nobody but observant and submissive Monsieur Lomaque, who smiled to himself again, and drilled harder than ever at his hole in the grass. &quot;I think Monsieur Trudaine was about to speak,&quot; said Madame Danville. &quot;Perhaps he will have no objection to let us hear what he was going to say.&quot; &quot;None, madame,&quot; replied Trudaine, politely. &quot;I was about to take upon myself the blame of Rose&#x27;s want of respect for believers in omens, by confessing that I have always encouraged her to laugh at superstitions of every kind.&quot; &quot;You a ridiculer of superstitions?&quot; said Danville, turning quickly on him. &quot;You, who have built a laboratory; you, who are an amateur professor of the occult arts of chemistry--a seeker after the Elixir of Life. On my word of honor, you astonish me!&quot; There was an ironical politeness in his voice, look, and manner as he said this, which his mother and his land-steward, Monsieur Lomaque, evidently knew how to interpret. The first touched his arm again and whispered, &quot;Be careful!&quot; the second suddenly grew serious, and left off drilling his hole in the grass. Rose neither heard the warning of Madame Danville, nor noticed the alteration in Lomaque. She was looking round at her brother, and was waiting with a bright, affectionate smile to hear his answer. He nodded, as if to reassure her, before he spoke again to Danville. &quot;You have rather romantic ideas about experiments in chemistry,&quot; he said, quietly. &quot;Mine have so little connection with what you call the occult arts that all the world might see them, if all the world thought it worth while. The only Elixirs of Life that I know of are a quiet heart and a contented mind. Both those I found, years and years ago, when Rose and I first came to live together in the house yonder.&quot; He spoke with a quiet sadness in his voice, which meant far more to his sister than the simple words he uttered. Her eyes filled with tears; she turned for a moment from her lover, and took her brother&#x27;s hand. &quot;Don&#x27;t talk, Louis, as if you thought you were going to lose your sister, because--&quot; Her lips began to tremble, and she stopped suddenly. &quot;More jealous than ever of your taking her away from him!&quot; whispered Madame Danville in her son&#x27;s ear. &quot;Hush! don&#x27;t, for God&#x27;s sake, take any notice of it,&quot; she added, hurriedly, as he rose from the seat and faced Trudaine with undisguised irritation and impatience in his manner. Before he could speak, the old servant Guillaume made his appearance, and announced that coffee was ready. Madame Danville again said &quot;Hush!&quot; and quickly took one of his arms, while he offered the other to Rose. &quot;Charles,&quot; said the young girl, amazedly, &quot;how flushed your face is, and how your arm trembles!&quot; He controlled himself in a moment, smiled, and said to her: &quot;Can&#x27;t you guess why, Rose? I am thinking of to-morrow.&quot; While he was speaking, he passed close by the land-steward, on his way back to the house with the ladies. The smile returned to Monsieur Lomaque&#x27;s lean face, and a curious light twinkled in his red-rimmed eyes as he began a fresh hole in the grass. &quot;Won&#x27;t you go indoors, and take some coffee?&quot; asked Trudaine, touching the land-steward on the arm. Monsieur Lomaque started a little and left his cane sticking in the ground. &quot;A thousand thanks, monsieur,&quot; he said; &quot;may I be allowed to follow you?&quot; &quot;I confess the beauty of the evening makes me a little unwilling to leave this place just yet.&quot; &quot;Ah! the beauties of Nature--I feel them with you, Monsieur Trudaine; I feel them here.&quot; Saying this, Lomaque laid one hand on his heart, and with the other pulled his stick out of the grass. He had looked as little at the landscape or the setting sun as Monsieur Justin himself. They sat down, side by side, on the empty bench; and then there followed an awkward pause. Submissive Lomaque was too discreet to forget his place, and venture on starting a new topic. Trudaine was preoccupied, and disinclined to talk. It was necessary, however, in common politeness, to say something. Hardly attending himself to his own words, he began with a commonplace phrase: &quot;I regret, Monsieur Lomaque, that we have not had more opportunities of bettering our acquaintance.&quot; &quot;I feel deeply indebted,&quot; rejoined the land-steward, &quot;to the admirable Madame Danville for having chosen me as her escort hither from her son&#x27;s estate near Lyons, and having thereby procured for me the honor of this introduction.&quot; Both Monsieur Lomaque&#x27;s red-rimmed eyes were seized with a sudden fit of winking, as he made this polite speech. His enemies were accustomed to say that, whenever he was particularly insincere, or particularly deceitful, he always took refuge in the weakness of his eyes, and so evaded the trying ordeal of being obliged to look steadily at the person whom he was speaking with. &quot;I was pleased to hear you mention my late father&#x27;s name, at dinner, in terms of high respect,&quot; continued Trudaine, resolutely keeping up the conversation. &quot;Did you know him?&quot; &quot;I am indirectly indebted to your excellent father,&quot; answered the land-steward, &quot;for the very situation which I now hold. At a time when the good word of a man of substance and reputation was needed to save me from poverty and ruin, your father spoke that word. Since then I have, in my own very small way, succeeded in life, until I have risen to the honor of superintending the estate of Monsieur Danville.&quot; &quot;Excuse me, but your way of speaking of your present situation rather surprises me. Your father, I believe, was a merchant, just as Danville&#x27;s father was a merchant; the only difference between them was that one failed and the other realized a large fortune. Why should you speak of yourself as honored by holding your present place?&quot; &quot;Have you never heard?&quot; exclaimed Lomaque, with an appearance of great astonishment, &quot;or can you have heard, and forgotten, that Madame Danville is descended from one of the noble houses of France? Has she never told you, as she has often told me, that she condescended when she married her late husband; and that her great object in life is to get the title of her family (years since extinct in the male line) settled on her son?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Trudaine; &quot;I remember to have heard something of this, and to have paid no great attention to it at the time, having little sympathy with such aspirations as you describe. You have lived many years in Danville&#x27;s service, Monsieur Lomaque; have you&quot;--he hesitated for a moment, then continued, looking the land-steward full in the face--&quot;have you found him a good and kind master?&quot; Lomaque&#x27;s thin lips seemed to close instinctively at the question, as if he were never going to speak again. He bowed--Trudaine waited--he only bowed again. Trudaine waited a third time. Lomaque looked at his host with perfect steadiness for an instant, then his eyes began to get weak again. &quot;You seem to have some special interest,&quot; he quietly remarked, &quot;if I may say so without offense, in asking me that question.&quot; &quot;I deal frankly, at all hazards, with every one,&quot; returned Trudaine; &quot;and stranger as you are, I will deal frankly with you. I acknowledge that I have an interest in asking that question--the dearest, the tenderest of all interests.&quot; At those last words, his voice trembled for a moment, but he went on firmly; &quot;from the beginning of my sister&#x27;s engagement with Danville, I made it my duty not to conceal my own feelings; my conscience and my affection for Rose counseled me to be candid to the last, even though my candor should distress or offend others. When we first made the acquaintance of Madame Danville, and when I first discovered that her son&#x27;s attentions to Rose were not unfavorably received, I felt astonished, and, though it cost me a hard effort, I did not conceal that astonishment from my sister--&quot; Lomaque, who had hitherto been all attention, started here, and threw up his hands in amazement. &quot;Astonished, did I hear you say? Astonished, Monsieur Trudaine, that the attentions of a young gentleman, possessed of all the graces and accomplishments of a highly-bred Frenchman, should be favorably received by a young lady! Astonished that such a dancer, such a singer, such a talker, such a notoriously fascinating ladies&#x27; man as Monsieur Danville, should, by dint of respectful assiduity, succeed in making some impression on the heart of Mademoiselle Rose! Oh, Monsieur Trudaine, venerated Monsieur Trudaine, this is almost too much to credit!&quot; Lomaque&#x27;s eyes grew weaker than ever, and winked incessantly as he uttered this apostrophe. At the end, he threw up his hands again, and blinked inquiringly all round him, in mute appeal to universal nature. &quot;When, in the course of time, matters were further advanced,&quot; continued Trudaine, without paying any attention to the interruption; &quot;when the offer of marriage was made, and when I knew that Rose had in her own heart accepted it, I objected, and I did not conceal my objections--&quot; &quot;Heavens!&quot; interposed Lomaque again, clasping his hands this time with a look of bewilderment; &quot;what objections, what possible objections to a man young and well-bred, with an immense fortune and an uncompromised character? I have heard of these objections; I know they have made bad blood; and I ask myself again and again, what can they be?&quot; &quot;God knows I have often tried to dismiss them from my mind as fanciful and absurd,&quot; said Trudaine, &quot;and I have always failed. It is impossible, in your presence, that I can describe in detail what my own impressions have been, from the first, of the master whom you serve. Let it be enough if I confide to you that I cannot, even now, persuade myself of the sincerity of his attachment to my sister, and that I feel--in spite of myself, in spite of my earnest desire to put the most implicit confi dence in Rose&#x27;s choice--a distrust of his character and temper, which now, on the eve of the marriage, amounts to positive terror. Long secret suffering, doubt, and suspense, wring this confession from me, Monsieur Lomaque, almost unawares, in defiance of caution, in defiance of all the conventionalities of society. You have lived for years under the same roof with this man; you have seen him in his most unguarded and private moments. I tempt you to betray no confidence--I only ask you if you can make me happy by telling me that I have been doing your master grievous injustice by my opinion of him? I ask you to take my hand, and tell me if you can, in all honor, that my sister is not risking the happiness of her whole life by giving herself in marriage to Danville to-morrow!&quot; He held out his hand while he spoke. By some strange chance, Lomaque happened just at that moment to be looking away toward those beauties of Nature which he admired so greatly. &quot;Really, Monsieur Trudaine, really such an appeal from you, at such a time, amazes me.&quot; Having got so far, he stopped and said no more. &quot;When we first sat down together here, I had no thought of making this appeal, no idea of talking to you as I have talked,&quot; pursued the other. &quot;My words have escaped me, as I told you, almost unawares; you must make allowances for them and for me. I cannot expect others, Monsieur Lomaque, to appreciate and understand my feelings for Rose. We two have lived alone in the world together; father, mother, kindred, they all died years since, and left us. I am so much older than my sister that I have learned to feel toward her more as a father than as a brother. All my life, all my dearest hopes, all my highest expectations, have centered in her. I was past the period of my boyhood when my mother put my little child sister&#x27;s hand in mine, and said to me on her death-bed: &#x27;Louis, be all to her that I have been, for she has no one left to look to but you.&#x27; Since then the loves and ambitions of other men have not been my loves or my ambitions. Sister Rose--as we all used to call her in those past days, as I love to call her still--Sister Rose has been the one aim, the one happiness, the one precious trust, the one treasured reward, of all my life. I have lived in this poor house, in this dull retirement, as in a paradise, because Sister Rose--my innocent, happy, bright-faced Eve--has lived here with me. Even if the husband of her choice had been the husband of mine, the necessity of parting with her would have been the hardest, the bitterest of trials. As it is, thinking what I think, dreading what I dread, judge what my feelings must be on the eve of her marriage; and know why, and with what object, I made the appeal which surprised you a moment since, but which cannot surprise you now. Speak if you will--I can say no more.&quot; He sighed bitterly; his head dropped on his breast, and the hand which he had extended to Lomaque trembled as he withdrew it and let it fall at his side. The land-steward was not a man accustomed to hesitate, but he hesitated now. He was not usually at a loss for phrases in which to express himself, but he stammered at the very outset of his reply. &quot;Suppose I answered,&quot; he began, slowly; &quot;suppose I told you that you wronged him, would my testimony really be strong enough to shake opinions, or rather presumptions, which have been taking firmer and firmer hold of you for months and months past? Suppose, on the other hand, that my master had his little&quot; (Lomaque hesitated before he pronounced the next word)--&quot;his little--infirmities, let me say; but only hypothetically, mind that--infirmities; and suppose I had observed them, and was willing to confide them to you, what purpose would such a confidence answer now, at the eleventh hour, with Mademoiselle Rose&#x27;s heart engaged, with the marriage fixed for tomorrow? No! no! trust me--&quot; Trudaine looked up suddenly. &quot;I thank you for reminding me, Monsieur Lomaque, that it is too late now to make inquiries, and by consequence too late also to trust in others. My sister has chosen; and on the subject of that choice my lips shall be henceforth sealed. The events of the future are with God; whatever they may be, I hope I am strong enough to bear my part in them with the patience and the courage of a man! I apologize, Monsieur Lomaque, for having thoughtlessly embarrassed you by questions which I had no right to ask. Let us return to the house--I will show you the way.&quot; Lomaque&#x27;s lips opened, then closed again; he bowed uneasily, and his sallow complexion whitened for a moment. Trudaine led the way in silence back to the house; the land-steward following slowly at a distance of several paces, and talking in whispers to himself. &quot;His father was the saving of me,&quot; muttered Lomaque; &quot;that is truth, and there is no getting over it; his father was the saving  of me; and yet here am I--no! it&#x27;s too late!--too late to speak--too late to act--too late to do anything!&quot; Close to the house they were met by the old servant. &quot;My young lady has just sent me to call you in to coffee, monsieur,&quot; said Guillaume. &quot;She has kept a cup hot for you, and another cup for Monsieur Lomaque.&quot; The land-steward started--this time with genuine astonishment. &quot;For me!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Mademoiselle Rose has troubled herself to keep a cup of coffee hot for me?&quot; The old servant stared; Trudaine stopped and looked back. &quot;What is there so very surprising,&quot; he asked, &quot;in such an ordinary act of politeness on my sister&#x27;s part?&quot; &quot;Excuse me, Monsieur Trudaine,&quot; answered Lomaque; &quot;you have not passed such an existence as mine--you are not a friendless old man--you have a settled position in the world, and are used to be treated with consideration. I am not. This is the first occasion in my life on which I find myself an object for the attention of a young lady, and it takes me by surprise. I repeat my excuses; pray let us go in.&quot; Trudaine made no reply to this curious explanation. He wondered at it a little, however, and he wondered still more when, on entering the drawing-room, he saw Lomaque walk straight up to his sister, and--apparently not noticing that Danville was sitting at the harpsichord and singing at the time--address her confusedly and earnestly with a set speech of thanks for his hot cup of coffee. Rose looked perplexed, and half inclined to laugh, as she listened to him. Madame Danville, who sat by her side, frowned, and tapped the land-steward contemptuously on the arm with her fan. &quot;Be so good as to keep silent until my son has done singing,&quot; she said. Lomaque made a low bow, and retiring to a table in a corner, took up a newspaper lying on it. If Madame Danville had seen the expression that came over his face when he turned away from her, proud as she was, her aristocratic composure might possibly have been a little ruffled. Danville had finished his song, had quitted the harpsichord, and was talking in whispers to his bride; Madame Danville was adding a word to the conversation every now and then; Trudaine was seated apart at the far end of the room, thoughtfully reading a letter which he had taken from his pocket, when an exclamation from Lomaque, who was still engaged with the newspaper, caused all the other occupants of the apartment to suspend their employments and look up. &quot;What is it?&quot; asked Danville, impatiently. &quot;Shall I be interrupting if I explain?&quot; inquired Lomaque, getting very weak in the eyes again, as he deferentially addressed himself to Madame Danville. &quot;You have already interrupted us,&quot; said the old lady, sharply; &quot;so you may now just as well explain.&quot; &quot;It is a passage from the _Scientific Intelligence_ which has given me great delight, and which will be joyful news for every one here.&quot; Saying this, Lomaque looked significantly at Trudaine, and then read from the newspaper these lines: &quot;ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, PARIS.--The vacant sub-professorship of chemistry has been offered, we are rejoiced to hear, to a gentleman whose modesty has hitherto prevented his scientific merits from becoming sufficiently prominent in the world. To the members of the academy he has been long since known  as the originato r of some of the most remarkable improvements in chemistry which have been made of late years--improvements, the credit of which he has, with rare, and we were almost about to add, culpable moderation, allowed others to profit by with impunity. No man in any profession is more thoroughly entitled to have a position of trust and distinction conferred on him by the State than the gentleman to whom we refer--M. Louis Trudaine.&quot; Before Lomaque could look up from the paper to observe the impression which his news produced, Rose had gained her brother&#x27;s side and was kissing him in a flutter of delight. &quot;Dear Louis,&quot; she cried, clapping her hands, &quot;let me be the first to congratulate you! How proud and glad I am! You accept the professorship, of course?&quot; Trudaine, who had hastily and confusedly put his letter back in his pocket the moment Lomaque began to read, seemed at a loss for an answer. He patted his sister&#x27;s hand rather absently, and said: &quot;I have not made up my mind; don&#x27;t ask me why, Rose--at least not now, not just now.&quot; An expression of perplexity and distress came over his face, as he gently motioned her to resume her chair. &quot;Pray, is a sub-professor of chemistry supposed to hold the rank of a gentleman?&quot; asked Madame Danville, without the slightest appearance of any special interest in Lomaque&#x27;s news. &quot;Of course not,&quot; replied her son, with a sarcastic laugh; &quot;he is expected to work and make himself useful. What gentleman does that?&quot; &quot;Charles!&quot; exclaimed the old lady, reddening with anger. &quot;Bah!&quot; cried Danville, turning his back on her, &quot;enough of chemistry. Lomaque, now you have begun reading the newspaper, try if you can&#x27;t find something interesting to read about. What are the last accounts from Paris? Any more symptoms of a general revolt?&quot; Lomaque turned to another part of the paper. &quot;Bad, very bad prospects for the restoration of tranquillity,&quot; he said. &quot;Necker, the people&#x27;s Minister, is dismissed. Placards against popular gatherings are posted all over Paris. The Swiss Guards have been ordered to the Champs Elysees, with four pieces of artillery. No more is yet known, but the worst is dreaded. The breach between the aristocracy and the people is widening fatally almost hour by hour.&quot; Here he stopped and laid down the newspaper. Trudaine took it from him, and shook his head forebodingly as he looked over the paragraph which had just been read. &quot;Bah!&quot; cried Madame Danville. &quot;The People, indeed! Let those four pieces of artillery be properly loaded, let the Swiss Guards do their duty, and we shall hear no more of the People!&quot; &quot;I advise you not to be sure of that,&quot; said her son, carelessly; &quot;there are rather too many people in Paris for the Swiss Guards to shoot conveniently. Don&#x27;t hold your head too aristocratically high, mother, till we are quite certain which way the wind really does blow. Who knows if I may not have to bow just as low one of these days to King Mob as ever you courtesied in your youth to King Louis the Fifteenth?&quot; He laughed complacently as he ended, and opened his snuff-box. His mother rose from her chair, her face crimson with indignation. &quot;I won&#x27;t hear you talk so--it shocks, it horrifies me!&quot; she exclaimed, with vehement gesticulation. &quot;No, no! I decline to hear another word. I decline to sit by patiently while my son, whom I love, jests at the most sacred principles, and sneers at the memory of an anointed king. This is my reward, is it, for having yielded and having come here, against all the laws of etiquette, the night before the marriage? I comply no longer; I resume my own will and my own way. I order you, my son, to accompany me back to Rouen. We are the bridegroom&#x27;s party, and we have no business overnight at the house of the bride. You meet no more till you meet at the church. Justin, my coach! Lomaque, pick up my hood. Monsieur Trudaine, thanks for your hospitality; I shall hope to return it with interest the first time you are in our neighborhood. Mademoiselle, put on your best looks tomorrow, along with your wedding finery; remember that my son&#x27;s bride must do honor to my son&#x27;s taste. Justin! my coach--drone, vagabond, idiot, where is my coach?&quot; &quot;My mother looks handsome when she is in a passion, does she not, Rose?&quot; said Danville, quietly putting up his snuff-box as the old lady sailed out of the room. &quot;Why, you seem quite frightened, love,&quot; he added, taking her hand with his easy, graceful air; &quot;frightened, let me assure you, without the least cause. My mother has but that one prejudice, and that one weak point, Rose. You will find her a very dove for gentleness, as long as you do not wound her pride of caste. Come, come, on this night, of all others, you must not send me away with such a face as that.&quot; He bent down and whispered to her a bridegroom&#x27;s compliment, which brought the blood back to her cheek in an instant. &quot;Ah, how she loves him--how dearly she loves him!&quot; thought her brother, watching her from his solitary corner of the room, and seeing the smile that brightened her blushing face when Danville kissed her hand at parting. Lomaque, who had remained imperturbably cool during the outbreak of the old lady&#x27;s anger--Lomaque, whose observant eyes had watched sarcastically the effect of the scene between mother and son on Trudaine and his sister, was the last to take leave. After he had bowed to Rose with a certain gentleness in his manner, which contrasted strangely with his wrinkled, haggard face, he held out his hand to her brother &quot;I did not take your hand when we sat together on the bench,&quot; he said; &quot;may I take it now?&quot; Trudaine met his advance courteously, but in silence. &quot;You may alter your opinion of me one of these days.&quot; Adding those words in a whisper, Monsieur Lomaque bowed once more to the bride and went out. For a few minutes after the door had closed the brother and sister kept silence. &quot;Our last night together at home!&quot; That was the thought which now filled the heart of each. Rose was the first to speak. Hesitating a little as she approached her brother, she said to him, anxiously: &quot;I am sorry for what happened with Madame Danville, Louis. Does it make you think the worse of Charles?&quot; &quot;I can make allowance for Madame Danville&#x27;s anger,&quot; returned Trudaine, evasively, &quot;because she spoke from honest conviction.&quot; &quot;Honest?&quot; echoed Rose, sadly, &quot;honest?--ah, Louis! I know you are thinking disparagingly of Charles&#x27;s convictions, when you speak so of his mother&#x27;s.&quot; Trudaine smiled and shook his head; but she took no notice of the gesture of denial--only stood looking earnestly and wistfully into his face. Her eyes began to fill; she suddenly threw her arms round his neck, and whispered to him: &quot;Oh, Louis, Louis! how I wish I could teach you to see Charles with my eyes!&quot; He felt her tears on his cheek as she spoke, and tried to reassure her. &quot;You shall teach me, Rose--you shall, indeed. Come, come, we must keep up our spirits, or how are you to look your best to-morrow?&quot; He unclasped her arms, and led her gently to a chair. At the same moment there was a knock at the door, and Rose&#x27;s maid appeared, anxious to consult her mistress on some of the preparations for the wedding ceremony. No interruption could have been more welcome just at that time. It obliged Rose to think of present trifles, and it gave her brother an excuse for retiring to his study. He sat down by his desk, doubting and heavy-hearted, and placed the letter from the Academy of Sciences open before him. Passing over all the complimentary expressions which it contained, his eye rested only on these lines at the end: &quot;During the first three years of your professorship, you will be required to reside in or near Paris nine months out of the year, for the purpose of delivering lectures and superintending experiments from time to time in the laboratories.&quot; The letter in which these lines occurred offered him such a position as in his modest self-distrust he had never dreamed of before; the lines themselves contained the promise of such vast facilities for carrying on his favorite experiments as he could never hope to command in his own little study, with his own limited means; and yet, there he now sat doubting whether he should accept or reject the tempting honors and advantages that were offered to him--doubting for his sister&#x27;s sake! &quot;Nine months of the year in Paris,&quot; he said to himself, sadly; &quot;and Rose is to pass her married life at Lyons. Oh, if I could clear my heart of its dread on her account--if I could free my mind of its forebodings for her future--how gladly I would answer this letter by accepting the trust it offers me!&quot; He paused for a few minutes, and reflected. The thoughts that were in him marked their ominous course in the growing paleness of his cheek, in the dimness that stole over his eyes. &quot;If this cleaving distrust from which I cannot free myself should be in very truth the mute prophecy of evil to come--to come, I know not when--if it be so (which God forbid!), how soon she may want a friend, a protector near at hand, a ready refuge in the time of her trouble! Where shall she then find protection or refuge? With that passionate woman? With her husband&#x27;s kindred and friends?&quot; He shuddered as the thought crossed his mind, and opening a blank sheet of paper, dipped his pen in the ink. &quot;Be all to her, Louis, that I have been,&quot; he murmured to himself, repeating his mother&#x27;s last words, and beginning the letter while he uttered them. It was soon completed. It expressed in the most respectful terms his gratitude for the offer made to him, and his inability to accept it, in consequence of domestic circumstances which it was needless to explain. The letter was directed, sealed; it only remained for him to place it in the post-bag, lying near at hand. At this last decisive act he hesitated. He had told Lomaque, and he had firmly believed himself, that he had conquered all ambitions for his sister&#x27;s sake. He knew now, for the first time, that he had only lulled them to rest--he knew that the letter from Paris had aroused them. His answer was written, his hand was on the post-bag, and at that moment the whole struggle had to be risked over again--risked when he was most unfit for it! He was not a man under any ordinary circumstances to procrastinate, but he procrastinated now. &quot;Night brings counsel; I will wait till to-morrow,&quot; he said to himself, and put the letter of refusal in his pocket, and hastily quitted the laboratory. CHAPTER II. INEXORABLY the important morrow came: irretrievably, for good or for evil, the momentous marriage-vow was pronounced. Charles Danville and Rose Trudaine were now man and wife. The prophecy of the magnificent sunset overnight had not proved false. It was a cloudless day on the marriage morning. The nuptial ceremonies had proceeded smoothly throughout, and had even satisfied Madame Danville. She returned with the wedding-party to Trudaine&#x27;s house, all smiles and serenity. To the bride she was graciousness itself. &quot;Good girl,&quot; said the old lady, following Rose into a corner, and patting her approvingly on the cheek with her fan; &quot;good girl, you have looked well this morning--you have done credit to my son&#x27;s taste. Indeed, you have pleased me, child! Now go upstairs, and get on your traveling-dress, and count on my maternal affection as long as you make Charles happy.&quot; It had been arranged that the bride and bridegroom should pass their honeymoon in Brittany, and then return to Danville&#x27;s estate near Lyons. The parting was hurried over, as all such partings should be. The carriage had driven off; Trudaine, after lingering long to look after it, had returned hastily to the house; the very dust of the whirling wheels had all dispersed; there was absolutely nothing to see; and yet there stood Monsieur Lomaque at the outer gate; idly, as if he was an independent man--calmly, as if no such responsibilities as the calling of Madame Danville&#x27;s coach, and the escorting of Madame Danville back to Lyons, could possibly rest on his shoulders. Idly and calmly, slowly rubbing his hands one over the other, slowly nodding his head in the direction by which the bride and bridegroom had departed, stood the eccentric land-steward at the outer gate. On a sudden the sound of footsteps approaching from the house seemed to arouse him. Once more he looked out into the road, as if he expected still to see the carriage of the newly-married couple. &quot;Poor girl! ah, poor girl!&quot; said Monsieur Lomaque softly to himself, turning round to ascertain who was coming from the house. It was only the postman with a letter in his hand, and the post-bag crumpled up under his arm. &quot;Any fresh news from Paris, friend?&quot; asked Lomaque. &quot;Very bad, monsieur,&quot; answered the postman. &quot;Camille Desmoulins has appealed to the people in the Palais Royal; there are fears of a riot.&quot; &quot;Only a riot!&quot; repeated Lomaque, sarcastically. &quot;Oh, what a brave Government not to be afraid of anything worse! Any letters?&quot; he added, hastily dropping the subject. &quot;None _to_ the house,&quot; said the postman, &quot;only one _from_ it, given me by Monsieur Trudaine. Hardly worth while,&quot; he added, twirling the letter in his hand, &quot;to put it into the bag, is it?&quot; Lomaque looked over his shoulder as he spoke, and saw that the letter was directed to the President of the Academy of Sciences, Paris. &quot;I wonder whether he accepts the place or refuses it?&quot; thought the land-steward, nodding to the postman, and continuing on his way back to the house. At the door he met Trudaine, who said to him, rather hastily, &quot;You are going back to Lyons with Madame Danville, I suppose?&quot; &quot;This very day,&quot; answered Lomaque. &quot;If you should hear of a convenient bachelor lodging, at Lyons, or near it,&quot; continued the other, dropping his voice and speaking more rapidly than before, &quot;you would be doing me a favor if you would let me know about it.&quot; Lomaque assented; but before he could add a question which was on the tip of his tongue, Trudaine had vanished in the interior of the house. &quot;A bachelor lodging!&quot; repeated the land-steward, standing alone on the doorstep. &quot;At or near Lyons! Aha! Monsieur Trudaine, I put your bachelor lodging and your talk to me last night together, and I make out a sum total which is, I think, pretty near the mark. You have refused that Paris appointment, my friend; and I fancy I can guess why.&quot; He paused thoughtfully, and shook his head with ominous frowns and bitings of his lips. &quot;All clear enough in that sky,&quot; he continued, after a while, looking up at the lustrous midday heaven. &quot;All clear enough there; but I think I see a little cloud rising in a certain household firmament already--a little cloud which hides much, and which I for one shall watch carefully.&quot; _PART SECOND._ CHAPTER I. FIVE years have elapsed since Monsieur Lomaque stood thoughtfully at the gate of Trudaine&#x27;s house, looking after the carriage of the bride and bridegroom, and seriously reflecting on the events of the future. Great changes have passed over that domestic firmament in which he prophetically discerned the little warning cloud. Greater changes have passed over the firmament of France. What was revolt five years ago is Revolution now--revolution which has ingulfed thrones, and principalities, and powers; which has set up crownless, inhereditary kings and counselors of its own, and has bloodily torn them down again by dozens; which has raged and raged on unrestrainedly in fierce earnest, until but one king can still govern and control it for a little while. That king is named Terror, and seventeen hundred and ninety-four is the year of his reign. Monsieur Lomaque, land-steward no longer, sits alone in an official-looking room in one of the official buildings of Paris. It is another July evening, as fine as that evening when he and Trudaine sat talking together on the bench overlooking the Seine. The window of the room is wide open, and a faint, pleasant breeze is beginning to flow through it. But Lomaque breathes uneasily, as if still oppressed by the sultry midday heat; and there are signs of perplexity and trouble in his face as he looks down absently now and then into the street. The times he lives in are enough of themselves to sadden any man&#x27;s face. In the Reign of Terror no living being in all the city of Paris can rise in the morning and be certain of e scaping the spy, the denunciation, the arrest, or the guillotine, before night. Such times are trying enough to oppress any man&#x27;s spirits; but Lomaque is not thinking of them or caring for them now. Out of a mass of papers which lie before him on his old writing-table, he has just taken up and read one, which has carried his thoughts back to the past, and to the changes which have taken place since he stood alone on the doorstep of Trudaine&#x27;s house, pondering on what might happen. More rapidly even than he had foreboded those changes had occurred. In less time even than he had anticipated, the sad emergency for which Rose&#x27;s brother had prepared, as for a barely possible calamity, overtook Trudaine, and called for all the patience, the courage, the self-sacrifice which he had to give for his sister&#x27;s sake. By slow gradations downward, from bad to worse, her husband&#x27;s character manifested itself less and less disguisedly almost day by day. Occasional slights, ending in habitual neglect; careless estrangement, turning to cool enmity; small insults, which ripened evilly to great injuries--these were the pitiless signs which showed her that she had risked all and lost all while still a young woman--these were the unmerited afflictions which found her helpless, and would have left her helpless, but for the ever-present comfort and support of her brother&#x27;s self-denying love. From the first, Trudaine had devoted himself to meet such trials as now assailed him; and like a man he met them, in defiance alike of persecution from the mother and of insult from the son. The hard task was only lightened when, as time advanced, public trouble began to mingle itself with private grief. Then absorbing political necessities came as a relief to domestic misery. Then it grew to be the one purpose and pursuit of Danville&#x27;s life cunningly to shape his course so that he might move safely onward with the advancing revolutionary tide--he cared not whither, as long as he kept his possessions safe and his life out of danger. His mother, inflexibly true to her Old-World convictions through all peril, might entreat and upbraid, might talk of honor, and courage, and sincerity--he heeded her not, or heeded only to laugh. As he had taken the false way with his wife, so he was now bent on taking it with the world. The years passed on; destroying changes swept hurricane-like over the old governing system of France; and still Danville shifted successfully with the shifting times. The first days of the Terror approached; in public and in private--in high places and in low--each man now suspected his brother. Crafty as Danville was, even he fell under suspicion at last, at headquarters in Paris, principally on his mother&#x27;s account. This was his first political failure; and, in a moment of thoughtless rage and disappointment, he wreaked the irritation caused by it on Lomaque. Suspected himself, he in turn suspected the land-steward. His mother fomented the suspicion--Lomaque was dismissed. In the old times the victim would have been ruined, in the new times he was simply rendered eligible for a political vocation in life. Lomaque was poor, quick-witted, secret, not scrupulous. He was a good patriot; he had good patriot friends, plenty of ambition, a subtle, cat-like courage, nothing to dread--and he went to Paris. There were plenty of small chances there for men of his caliber. He waited for one of them. It came; he made the most of it; attracted favorably the notice of the terrible Fouquier-Tinville; and won his way to a place in the office of the Secret Police. Meanwhile, Danville&#x27;s anger cooled down; he recovered the use of that cunning sense which had hitherto served him well, and sent to recall the discarded servant. lt was too late. Lomaque was already in a position to set him at defiance--nay, to put his neck, perhaps, under the blade of the guillotine. Worse than this, anonymous letters reached him, warning him to lose no time in proving his patriotism by some indisputable sacrifice, and in silencing his mother, whose imprudent sincerity was likely ere long to cost her her life. Danville knew her well enough to know that there was but one way of saving her, and thereby saving himself. She had always refused to emigrate; but he now insisted that she should seize the first opportunity he could procure for her of quitting France until calmer times arrived. Probably she would have risked her own life ten times over rather than have obeyed him; but she had not the courage to risk her son&#x27;s too; and she yielded for his sake. Partly by secret influence, partly by unblushing fraud, Danville procured for her such papers and permits as would enable her to leave France by way of Marseilles. Even then she refused to depart, until she knew what her son&#x27;s plans were for the future. He showed her a letter which he was about to dispatch to Robespierre himself, vindicating his suspected patriotism, and indignantly demanding to be allowed to prove it by filling some office, no matter how small, under the redoubtable triumvirate which then governed, or more properly terrified, France. The sight of this document reassured Madame Danville. She bade her son farewell, and departed at last, with one trusty servant, for Marseilles. Danville&#x27;s intention, in sending his letter to Paris, had been simply to save himself by patriotic bluster. He was thunderstruck at receiving a reply, taking him at his word, and summoning him to the capital to accept employment there under the then existing Government. There was no choice but to obey. So to Paris he journeyed, taking his wife with him into the very jaws of danger. He was then at open enmity with Trudaine; and the more anxious and alarmed he could make the brother feel on the sister&#x27;s account, the better he was pleased. True to his trust and his love, through all dangers as through all persecutions, Trudaine followed them; and the street of their sojourn at Paris, in the perilous days of the Terror, was the street of his sojourn too. Danville had been astonished at the acceptance of his proffered services; he was still more amazed when he found that the post selected for him was one of the superintendent&#x27;s places in that very office of Secret Police in which Lomaque was employed as agent. Robespierre and his colleagues had taken the measure of their man--he had money enough, and local importance enough to be worth studying. They knew where he was to be distrusted, and how he might be made useful. The affairs of the Secret Police were the sort of affairs which an unscrupulously cunning man was fitted to help on; and the faithful exercise of that cunning in the service of the State was insured by the presence of Lomaque in the office. The discarded servant was just the right sort of spy to watch the suspected master. Thus it happened that, in the office of the Secret Police at Paris, and under the Reign of Terror, Lomaque&#x27;s old master was, nominally, his master still--the superintendent to whom he was ceremonially accountable, in public--the suspected man, whose slightest words and deeds he was officially set to watch, in private. Ever sadder and darker grew the face of Lomaque as he now pondered alone over the changes and misfortunes of the past five years. A neighboring church-clock striking the hour of seven aroused him from his meditations. He arranged the confused mass of papers before him--looked toward the door, as if expecting some one to enter--then, finding himself still alone, recurred to the one special paper which had first suggested his long train of gloomy thoughts. The few lines it contained were signed in cipher, and ran thus: &quot;You are aware that your superintendent, Danville, obtained leave of absence last week to attend to some affairs of his at Lyons, and that he is not expected back just yet for a day or two. While he is away, push on the affair of Trudaine. Collect all the evidence, and hold yourself in readiness to act on it at a moment&#x27;s notice. Don&#x27;t leave the office till you have heard from me again. If you have a copy of the Private Instructions respecting Danville, which you wrote for me, send it to my house. I  wish to refresh my memory. Your original letter is burned.&quot; Here the note abruptly terminated. As he folded it up and put it in his pocket, Lomaque sighed. This was a very rare expression of feeling with him. He leaned back in his chair, and beat his nails impatiently on the table. Suddenly there was a faint little tap at the room door, and eight or ten men--evidently familiars of the new French Inquisition--quietly entered, and ranged themselves against the wall. Lomaque nodded to two of them. &quot;Picard and Magloire, go and sit down at that desk. I shall want you after the rest are gone.&quot; Saying this, Lomaque handed certain sealed and docketed papers to the other men waiting in the room, who received them in silence, bowed, and went out. Innocent spectators might have thought them clerks taking bills of lading from a merchant. Who could have imagined that the giving and receiving of Dununciations, Arrest-orders, and Death-warrants--the providing of its doomed human meal for the all-devouring guillotine--could have been managed so coolly and quietly, with such unruffled calmness of official routine? &quot;Now,&quot; said Lomaque, turning to the two men at the desk, as the door closed, &quot;have you got those notes about you?&quot; (They answered in the affirmative.) &quot;Picard, you have the first particulars of this affair of Trudaine; so you must begin reading. I have sent in the reports; but we may as well go over the evidence again from the commencement, to make sure that nothing has been left out. If any corrections are to be made, now is the time to make them. Read, Picard, and lose as little time as you possibly can.&quot; Thus admonished, Picard drew some long slips of paper from his pocket, and began reading from them as follows: &quot;Minutes of evidence collected concerning Louis Trudaine, suspected, on the denunciation of Citizen Superintendent Danville, of hostility to the sacred cause of liberty, and of disaffection to the sovereignty of the people. (1.) The suspected person is placed under secret observation, and these facts are elicited: He is twice seen passing at night from his own house to a house in the Rue de Clery. On the first night he carries with him money--on the second, papers. He returns without either. These particulars have been obtained through a citizen engaged to help Trudaine in housekeeping (one of the sort called Servants in the days of the Tyrants). This man is a good patriot, who can be trusted to watch Trudaine&#x27;s actions. (2.) The inmates of the house in the Rue de Clery are numerous, and in some cases not so well known to the Government as could be wished. It is found difficult to gain certain information about the person or persons visited by Trudaine without having recourse to an arrest. (3.) An arrest is thought premature at this preliminary stage of the proceedings, being likely to stop the development of conspiracy, and give warning to the guilty to fly. Order thereupon given to watch and wait for the present. (4.) Citizen Superintendent Danville quits Paris for a short time. The office of watching Trudaine is then taken out of the hands of the undersigned, and is confided to his comrade, Magloire.--Signed, PICARD. Countersigned, LOMAQUE. Having read so far, the police agent placed his papers on the writing-table, waited a moment for orders, and, receiving none, went out. No change came over the sadness and perplexity of Lomaque&#x27;s face. He still beat his nails anxiously on the writing-table, and did not even look at the second agent as he ordered the man to read his report. Magloire produced some slips of paper precisely similar to Picard&#x27;s and read from them in the same rapid, business-like, unmodulated tones: &quot;Affair of Trudaine. Minutes continued. Citizen Agent Magloire having been appointed to continue the surveillance of Trudaine, reports the discovery of additional facts of importance. (1.) Appearances make it probable that Trudaine meditates a third secret visit to the house in the Rue de Clery. The proper measures are taken for observing him closely, and the result is the implication of another person discovered to be connected with the supposed conspiracy. This person is the sister of Trudaine, and the wife of Citizen Superintendent Danville.&quot; &quot;Poor, lost creature! ah, poor, lost creature!&quot; muttered Lomaque to himself, sighing again, and shifting uneasily from side to side, in his mangy old leathern armchair. Apparently, Magloire was not accustomed to sighs, interruptions, and expressions of regret from the usually imperturbable chief agent. He looked up from his papers with a stare of wonder. &quot;Go on, Magloire!&quot; cried Lomaque, with a sudden outburst of irritability. &quot; &quot;Why the devil don&#x27;t you go on?&quot;--&quot;All ready, citizen,&quot; returned Magloire, submissively, and proceeded: &quot;(2.) It is at Trudaine&#x27;s house that the woman Danville&#x27;s connection with her brother&#x27;s secret designs is ascertained, through the vigilance of the before-mentioned patriot citizen. The interview of the two suspected persons is private; their conversation is carried on in whispers. Little can be overheard; but that little suffices to prove that Trudaine&#x27;s sister is perfectly aware of his intention to proceed for the third time to the house in the Rue de Clery. It is further discovered that she awaits his return, and that she then goes back privately to her own house. (3.) Meanwhile, the strictest measures are taken for watching the house in the Rue de Clery. It is discovered that Trudaine&#x27;s visits are paid to a man and woman known to the landlord and lodgers by the name of Dubois. They live on the fourth floor. It is impossible, at the time of the discovery, to enter this room, or to see the citizen and citoyenne Dubois, without producing an undesirable disturbance in the house and neighborhood. A police agent is left to watch the place, while search and arrest orders are applied for. The granting of these is accidentally delayed. When they are ultimately obtained, it is discovered that the man and the woman are both missing. They have not hitherto been traced. (4.) The landlord of the house is immediately arrested, as well as the police agent appointed to watch the premises. The landlord protests that he knows nothing of his tenants. It is suspected, however, that he has been tampered with, as also that Trudaine&#x27;s papers, delivered to the citizen and citoyenne Dubois, are forged passports. With these and with money, it may not be impossible that they have already succeeded in escaping from France. The proper measures have been taken for stopping them, if they have not yet passed the frontiers. No further report in relation to them has yet been received (5.) Trudaine and his sister are under perpetual surveillance, and the undersigned holds himself ready for further orders.--Signed, MAGLOIRE. Countersigned, LOMAQUE.&quot; Having finished reading his notes, Magloire placed them on the writing-table. He was evidently a favored man in the office, and he presumed upon his position; for he ventured to make a remark, instead of leaving the room in silence, like his predecessor Picard. &quot;When Citizen Danville returns to Paris,&quot; he began, &quot;he will be rather astonished to find that in denouncing his wife&#x27;s brother he had also unconsciously denounced his wife.&quot; Lomaque looked up quickly, with that old weakness in his eyes which affected them in such a strangely irregular manner on certain occasions. Magloire knew what this symptom meant, and would have become confused if he had not been a police agent. As it was, he quietly backed a step or two from the table, and held his tongue. &quot;Friend Magloire,&quot; said Lomaque, winking mildly, &quot;your last remark looks to me like a question in disguise. I put questions constantly to others; I never answer questions myself. You want to know, citizen, what our superintendent&#x27;s secret motive is for denouncing his wife&#x27;s brother? Suppose you try and find that out for yourself. It will be famous practice for you, friend Magloire--famous practice after office hours.&quot; &quot;Any further orders?&quot; inquired Magloire, sulkily. &quot;None in relation to the reports,&quot; returned Lomaque. &quot;I find nothing to alter or add on a revised h earing. But I shall have a little note ready for you immediately. Sit down at the other desk, friend Magloire; I am very fond of you when you are not inquisitive; pray sit down.&quot; While addressing this polite invitation to the agent in his softest voice, Lomaque produced his pocketbook, and drew from it a little note, which he opened and read through attentively. It was headed: &quot;Private Instructions relative to Superintendent Danville,&quot; and proceeded thus: &quot;The undersigned can confidently assert, from long domestic experience in Danville&#x27;s household that his motive for denouncing his wife&#x27;s brother is purely a personal one, and is not in the most remote degree connected with politics. Briefly, the facts are these: Louis Trudaine, from the first, opposed his sister&#x27;s marriage with Danville, distrusting the latter&#x27;s temper and disposition. The marriage, however, took place, and the brother resigned himself to await results--taking the precaution of living in the same neighborhood as his sister, to interpose, if need be, between the crimes which the husband might commit and the sufferings which the wife might endure. The results soon exceeded his worst anticipations, and called for the interposition for which he had prepared himself. He is a man of inflexible firmness, patience, and integrity, and he makes the protection and consolation of his sister the business of his life. He gives his brother-in-law no pretext for openly quarreling with him. He is neither to be deceived, irritated, nor tired out, and he is Danville&#x27;s superior every way--in conduct, temper, and capacity. Under these circumstances, it is unnecessary to say that his brother-in-law&#x27;s enmity toward him is of the most implacable kind, and equally unnecessary to hint at the perfectly plain motive of the denuciation. &quot;As to the suspicious circumstances affecting not Trudaine only, but his sister as well, the undersigned regrets his inability, thus far, to offer either explanation or suggestion. At this preliminary stage, the affair seems involved in impenetrable mystery.&quot; Lomaque read these lines through, down to his own signature at the end. They were the duplicate Secret Instructions demanded from him in the paper which he had been looking over before the entrance of the two police agents. Slowly, and, as it seemed, unwillingly, he folded the note up in a fresh sheet of paper, and was preparing to seal it when a tap at the door stopped him. &quot;Come in,&quot; he cried, irritably; and a man in traveling costume, covered with dust, entered, quietly whispered a word or two in his ear, and then went out. Lomaque started at the whisper, and, opening his note again, hastily wrote under his signature: &quot;I have just heard that Danville has hastened his return to Paris, and may be expected back to-night.&quot; Having traced these lines, he closed, sealed, and directed the letter, and gave it to Magloire. The police agent looked at the address as he left the room; it was &quot;To Citizen Robespierre, Rue Saint-Honore.&quot; Left alone again, Lomaque rose, and walked restlessly backward and forward, biting his nails, &quot;Danville comes back to-night,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;and the crisis comes with him. Trudaine a conspirator! Bah! conspiracy can hardly be the answer to the riddle this time. What is?&quot; He took a turn or two in silence--then stopped at the open window, looking out on what little glimpse the street afforded him of the sunset sky. &quot;This time five years,&quot; he said, &quot;Trudaine was talking to me on that bench overlooking the river; and Sister Rose was keeping poor hatchet-faced old Lomaque&#x27;s cup of coffee hot for him! Now I am officially bound to suspect them both; perhaps to arrest them; perhaps--I wish this job had fallen into other hands. I don&#x27;t want it--I don&#x27;t want it at any price!&quot; He returned to the writing-table and sat down to his papers, with the dogged air of a man determined to drive away vexing thoughts by dint of sheer hard work. For more than an hour he labored on resolutely, munching a bit of dry bread from time to time. Then he paused a little, and began to think again. Gradually the summer twilight faded, and the room grew dark. &quot;Perhaps we shall tide over to-night, after all--who knows?&quot; said Lomaque, ringing his handbell for lights. They were brought in, and with them ominously returned the police agent Magloire with a small sealed packet. It contained an arrest-order and a tiny three-cornered note, looking more like a love-letter, or a lady&#x27;s invitation to a party, than anything else. Lomaque opened the note eagerly and read these lines neatly written, and signed with Robespierre&#x27;s initials--M. R.--formed elegantly in cipher: &quot;Arrest Trudaine and his sister to-night. On second thoughts, I am not sure, if Danville comes back in time to be present, that it may not be all the better. He is unprepared for his wife&#x27;s arrest. Watch him closely when it takes place, and report privately to me. I am afraid he is a vicious man; and of all things I abhor Vice.&quot; &quot;Any more work for me to-night?&quot; asked Magloire, with a yawn. &quot;Only an arrest,&quot; replied Lomaque. &quot;Collect our men; and when you&#x27;re ready get a coach at the door.&quot; &quot;We were just going to supper,&quot; grumbled Magloire to himself, as he went out. &quot;The devil seize the Aristocrats! They&#x27;re all in such a hurry to get to the guillotine that they won&#x27;t even give a man time to eat his victuals in peace!&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s no choice now,&quot; muttered Lomaque, angrily thrusting the arrest-order and the three-cornered note into his pocket. &quot;His father was the saving of me; he himself welcomed me like an equal; his sister treated me like a gentleman, as the phrase went in those days; and now--&quot; He stopped and wiped his forehead--then unlocked his desk, produced a bottle of brandy, and poured himself out a glass of the liquor, which he drank by sips, slowly. &quot;I wonder whether other men get softer-hearted as they grow older!&quot; he said. &quot;I seem to do so, at any rate. Courage! courage! what must be, must. If I risked my head to do it, I couldn&#x27;t stop this arrest. Not a man in the office but would be ready to execute it, if I wasn&#x27;t.&quot; Here the rumble of carriage-wheels sounded outside. &quot;There&#x27;s the coach! &quot; exclaimed Lomaque, locking up the brandy-bottle, and taking his hat. &quot;After all, as this arrest is to be made, it&#x27;s as well for them that I should make it.&quot; Consoling himself as he best could with this reflection, Chief Police Agent Lomaque blew out the candles, and quitted the room. CHAPTER II. IGNORANT of the change in her husband&#x27;s plans, which was to bring him back to Paris a day before the time that had been fixed for his return, Sister Rose had left her solitary home to spend the evening with her brother. They had sat talking together long after sunset, and had let the darkness steal on them insensibly, as people will who are only occupied with quiet, familiar conversation. Thus it happened, by a curious coincidence, that just as Lomaque was blowing out his candles at the office Rose was lighting the reading-lamp at her brother&#x27;s lodgings. Five years of disappointment and sorrow had sadly changed her to outward view. Her face looked thinner and longer; the once delicate red and white of her complexion was gone; her figure had wasted under the influence of some weakness, which had already made her stoop a little when she walked. Her manner had lost its maiden shyness, only to become unnaturally quiet and subdued. Of all the charms which had so fatally, yet so innocently, allured her heartless husband, but one remained--the winning gentleness of her voice. It might be touched now and then with a note of sadness, but the soft attraction of its even, natural tone still remained. In the marring of all other harmonies, this one harmony had been preserved unchanged. Her brother, though his face was careworn, and his manner sadder than of old, looked less altered from his former self. It is the most fragile material which soonest shows the flaw. The world&#x27;s idol, Beauty, holds its frailest tenure of existence in the one Temple where we most love to worship it. &quot;And so you think, Louis, that our perilous undertaking has really ended well by this tim e?&quot; said Rose, anxiously, as she lighted the lamp and placed the glass shade over it. &quot;What a relief it is only to hear you say you think we have succeeded at last!&quot; &quot;I said I hope, Rose,&quot; replied her brother. &quot;Well, even hoped is a great word from you, Louis--a great word from any one in this fearful city, and in these days of Terror.&quot; She stopped suddenly, seeing her brother raise his hand in warning. They looked at each other in silence and listened. The sound of footsteps going slowly past the house--ceasing for a moment just beyond it--then going on again--came through the open window. There was nothing else, out-of-doors or in, to disturb the silence of the night--the deadly silence of Terror which, for months past, had hung over Paris. It was a significant sign of the times, that even a passing footstep, sounding a little strangely at night, was subject for suspicion, both to brother and sister--so common a subject, that they suspended their conversation as a matter of course, without exchanging a word of explanation, until the tramp of the strange footsteps had died away. &quot;Louis,&quot; continued Rose, dropping her voice to a whisper, after nothing more was audible, &quot;when may I trust our secret to my husband?&quot; &quot;Not yet!&quot; rejoined Trudaine, earnestly. &quot;Not a word, not a hint of it, till I give you leave. Remember, Rose, you promised silence from the first. Everything depends on your holding that promise sacred till I release you from it.&quot; &quot;I will hold it sacred; I will indeed, at all hazards, under all provocations,&quot; she answered. &quot;That is quite enough to reassure me--and now, love, let us change the subject. Even these walls may have ears, and the closed door yonder may be no protection.&quot; He looked toward it uneasily while he spoke. &quot;By-the-by, I have come round to your way of thinking, Rose, about that new servant of mine--there is something false in his face. I wish I had been as quick to detect it as you were.&quot; Rose glanced at him affrightedly. &quot;Has he done anything suspicious? Have you caught him watching you? Tell me the worst, Louis.&quot; &quot;Hush! hush! my dear, not so loud. Don&#x27;t alarm yourself; he has done nothing suspicious.&quot; &quot;Turn him off--pray, pray turn him off, before it is too late!&quot; &quot;And be denounced by him, in revenge, the first night he goes to his Section. You forget that servants and masters are equal now. I am not supposed to keep a servant at all. I have a citizen living with me who lays me under domestic obligations, for which I make a pecuniary acknowledgment. No! no! if I do anything, I must try if I can&#x27;t entrap him into giving me warning. But we have got to another unpleasant subject already--suppose I change the topic again? You will find a little book on that table there, in the corner--tell me what you think of it.&quot; The book was a copy of Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Cid,&quot; prettily bound in blue morocco. Rose was enthusiastic in her praises. &quot;I found it in a bookseller&#x27;s shop, yesterday,&quot; said her brother, &quot;and bought it as a present for you. Corneille is not an author to compromise any one, even in these times. Don&#x27;t you remember saying the other day that you felt ashamed of knowing but little of our greatest dramatist?&quot; Rose remembered well, and smiled almost as happily as in the old times over her present. &quot;There are some good engravings at the beginning of each act,&quot; continued Trudaine, directing her attention rather earnestly to the illustrations, and then suddenly leaving her side when he saw that she became interested in looking at them. He went to the window--listened--then drew aside the curtain, and looked up and down the street. No living soul was in sight. &quot;I must have been mistaken,&quot; he thought, returning hastily to his sister; &quot;but I certainly fancied I was followed in my walk to-day by a spy.&quot; &quot;I wonder,&quot; asked Rose, still busy over her book, &quot;I wonder, Louis, whether my husband would let me go with you to see &#x27;Le Cid&#x27; the next time it is acted.&quot; &quot;No!&quot; cried a voice at the door; &quot;not if you went on your knees to ask him.&quot; Rose turned round with a scream. There stood her husband on the threshold, scowling at her, with his hat on, and his hands thrust doggedly into his pockets. Trudaine&#x27;s servant announced him, with an insolent smile, during the pause that followed the discovery. &quot;Citizen Superintendent Danville, to visit the citoyenne, his wife,&quot; said the fellow, making a mock bow to his master. Rose looked at her brother, then advanced a few paces toward the door. &quot;This is a surprise,&quot; she said, faintly; &quot;has anything happened? We--we didn&#x27;t expect you.&quot; Her voice failed her as she saw her husband advancing, pale to his very lips with suppressed anger. &quot;How dare you come here, after what I told you?&quot; he asked, in quick, low tones. She shrank at his voice almost as if he had struck her. The blood flew into her brother&#x27;s face as he noticed the action; but he controlled himself, and, taking her hand, led her in silence to a chair. &quot;I forbid you to sit down in his house,&quot; said Danville, advancing still; &quot;I order you to come back with me! Do you hear? I order you.&quot; He was approaching nearer to her, when he caught Trudaine&#x27;s eye fixed on him, and stopped. Rose started up, and placed herself between them. &quot;Oh, Charles, Charles!&quot; she said to her husband, &quot;be friends with Louis to-night, and be kind again to me. I have a claim to ask that much of you, though you may not think it!&quot; He turned away from her, and laughed contemptuously. She tried to speak again, but Trudaine touched her on the arm, and gave her a warning look. &quot;Signals!&quot; exclaimed Danville; &quot;secret signals between you!&quot; His eye, as he glanced suspiciously at his wife, fell on Trudaine&#x27;s gift-book, which she still held unconsciously. &quot;What book is that?&quot; he asked. &quot;Only a play of Corneille&#x27;s,&quot; answered Rose; &quot;Louis has just made me a present of it.&quot; At this avowal Danville&#x27;s suppressed anger burst beyond all control. &quot;Give it him back!&quot; he cried, in a voice of fury. &quot;You shall take no presents from him; the venom of the household spy soils everything he touches. Give it him back!&quot; She hesitated. &quot;You won&#x27;t?&quot; He tore the book from her with an oath, threw it on the floor, and set his foot on it. &quot;Oh, Louis! Louis! for God&#x27;s sake, remember.&quot; Trudaine was stepping forward as the book fell to the floor. At the same moment his sister threw her arms round him. He stopped, turning from fiery red to ghastly pale. &quot;No, no, Louis!&quot; she said, clasping him closer; &quot;not after five years&#x27; patience. No--no!&quot; He gently detached her arms. &quot;You are right, love. Don&#x27;t be afraid; it is all over now.&quot; Saying that, he put her from him, and in silence took up the book from the floor. &quot;Won&#x27;t _that_ offend you even?&quot; said Danville, with an insolent smile. &quot;You have a wonderful temper--any other man would have called me out!&quot; Trudaine looked back at him steadily; and taking out his handkerchief, passed it over the soiled cover of the book. &quot;If I could wipe the stain of your blood off my conscience as easily as I can wipe the stain of your boot off this book,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;you should not live another hour. Don&#x27;t cry, Rose,&quot; he continued, turning again to his sister: &quot;I will take care of your book for you until you can keep it yourself.&quot; &quot;You will do this! you will do that!&quot; cried Danville, growing more and more exasperated, and letting his anger got the better even of his cunning now. &quot;Talk less confidently of the future--you don&#x27;t know what it has in store for you. Govern your tongue when you are in my presence; a day may come when you will want my help--my help; do you hear that?&quot; Trudaine turned his face from his sister, as if he feared to let her see it when those words were spoken. &quot;The man who followed me to-day was a spy--Danville&#x27;s spy!&quot; That thought flashed across his mind, but he gave it no utterance. There was an instant&#x27;s pause of silence; and through it there came heavily on the still night air the rumbling of distant wheels. The sound advanced nearer and nearer--advanced and ceased under the window. Danville hurried to it, and looked out eagerly. &quot;I have not hastened my return without reason. I wouldn&#x27;t have missed this arrest for anything!&quot; thought he, peering into the night. The stars were out, but there was no moon. He could not recognize either the coach or the persons who got out of it, and he turned again into the interior of the room. His wife had sunk into a chair, her brother was locking up in a cabinet the book which he had promised to take care of for her. The dead silence made the noise of slowly ascending footsteps on the stairs painfully audible. At last the door opened softly. &quot;Citizen Danville, health and fraternity!&quot; said Lomaque, appearing in the doorway, followed by his agents. &quot;Citizen Louis Trudaine?&quot; he continued, beginning with the usual form. Rose started out of her chair; but her brother&#x27;s hand was on her lips before she could speak. &quot;My name is Louis Trudaine,&quot; he answered. &quot;Charles!&quot; cried his sister, breaking from him and appealing to her husband, &quot;who are these men? What are they here for?&quot; He gave her no answer. &quot;Louis Trudaine,&quot; said Lomaque, slowly, drawing the order from his pocket, &quot;in the name of the Republic, I arrest you.&quot; &quot;Rose, come back,&quot; cried Trudaine. It was too late; she had broken from him, and in the recklessness of terror, had seized her husband by the arm. &quot;Save him!&quot; she cried. &quot;Save him, by all you hold dearest in the world! You are that man&#x27;s superior, Charles--order him from the room!&quot; Danville roughly shook her hand off his arm. &quot;Lomaque is doing his duty. Yes,&quot; he added, with a glance of malicious triumph at Trudaine, &quot;yes, doing his duty. Look at me as you please--your looks won&#x27;t move me. I denounced you! I admit it--I glory in it! I have rid myself of an enemy, and the State of a bad citizen. Remember your secret visits to the house in the Rue de Clery!&quot; His wife uttered a cry of horror. She seized his arm again with both hands--frail, trembling hands--that seemed suddenly nerved with all the strength of a man&#x27;s. &quot;Come here--come here! I must and will speak to you!&quot; She dragged him by main force a few paces back, toward an unoccupied corner of the room. With deathly cheeks and wild eyes she raised herself on tiptoe, and put her lips to her husband&#x27;s ear. At that instant Trudaine called to her: &quot;Rose, if you speak I am lost!&quot; She stopped at the sound of his voice, dropped her hold on her husband&#x27;s arm, and faced her brother, shuddering. &quot;Rose,&quot; he continued, &quot;you have promised, and your promise is sacred. If you prize your honor, if you love me, come here--come here, and be silent.&quot; He held out his hand. She ran to him; and, laying her head on his bosom, burst into a passion of tears. Danville turned uneasily toward the police agents. &quot;Remove your prisoner,&quot; he said. &quot;You have done your duty here.&quot; &quot;Only half of it,&quot; retorted Lomaque, eying him attentively. &quot;Rose Danville--&quot; &quot;My wife!&quot; exclaimed the other. &quot;What about my wife?&quot; &quot;Rose Danville,&quot; continued Lomaque, impassibly, &quot;you are included in the arrest of Louis Trudaine.&quot; Rose raised her head quickly from her brother&#x27;s breast. His firmness had deserted him--he was trembling. She heard him whispering to himself, &quot;Rose, too! Oh, my God! I was not prepared for that.&quot; She heard these words, and dashed the tears from her eyes, and kissed him, saying: &quot;I am glad of it, Louis. We risked all together--we shall now suffer together. I am glad of it!&quot; Danville looked incredulously at Lomaque, after the first shock of astonishment was over. &quot;Impossible!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I never denounced my wife. There is some mistake; you have exceeded your orders.&quot; &quot;Silence!&quot; retorted Lomaque, imperiously. &quot;Silence, citizen, and respect to a decree of the Republic!&quot; &quot;You blackguard! show me the arrest-order!&quot; said Danville. &quot;Who has dared to denounce my wife?&quot; &quot;You have!&quot; said Lomaque, turning on him with a grin of contempt. &quot;You--and &#x27;blackguard&#x27; back in your teeth! You, in denouncing her brother! Aha! we work hard in our office; we don&#x27;t waste time in calling names--we make discoveries. If Trudaine is guilty, your wife is implicated in his guilt. We know it; and we arrest her.&quot; &quot;I resist the arrest,&quot; cried Danville. &quot;I am the authority here. Who opposes me?&quot; The impassible chief agent made no answer. Some new noise in the street struck his quick ear. He ran to the window and looked out eagerly. &quot;Who opposes me?&quot; reiterated Danville. &quot;Hark!&quot; exclaimed Lomaque, raising his hand. &quot;Silence, and listen!&quot; The heavy, dull tramp of men marching together became audible as he spoke. Voices humming low and in unison the Marseillaise hymn, joined solemnly with the heavy, regular footfalls. Soon the flare of torch-light began to glimmer redder and redder under the dim, starlight sky. &quot;Do you hear that? Do you see the advancing torch-light?&quot; cried Lomaque, pointing exultingly into the street. &quot;Respect to the national hymn, and to the man who holds in the hollow of his hand the destinies of all France! Hat off, Citizen Danville! Robespierre is in the street. His bodyguard, the Hard-hitters, are lighting him on his way to the Jacobin Club! Who shall oppose you, did you say? Your master and mine; the man whose signature is at the bottom of this order--the man who with a scratch of his pen can send both our heads rolling together into the sack of the guillotine! Shall I call to him as he passes the house? Shall I tell him that Superintendent Danville resists me in making an arrest? Shall I? Shall I?&quot; And in the immensity of his contempt, Lomaque seemed absolutely to rise in stature, as he thrust the arrest order under Danville&#x27;s eyes and pointed to the signature with the head of his stick. Rose looked round in terror, as Lomaque spoke his last words--looked round, and saw her husband recoil before the signature on the arrest order, as if the guillotine itself had suddenly arisen before him. Her brother felt her shrinking back in his arms, and trembled for the preservation of her self-control if the terror and suspense of the arrest lasted any longer. &quot;Courage, Rose, courage!&quot; he said. &quot;You have behaved nobly; you must not fail now. No, no! Not a word more. Not a word till I am able to think clearly again, and to decide what is best. Courage, love; our lives depend on it. Citizen,&quot; he continued, addressing himself to Lomaque, &quot;proceed with your duty--we are ready.&quot; The heavy marching footsteps outside were striking louder and louder on the ground; the chanting voices were every moment swelling in volume; the dark street was flaming again with the brightening torch-light, as Lomaque, under pretext of giving Trudaine his hat, came close to him, and, turning his back toward Danville, whispered: &quot;I have not forgotten the eve of the wedding and the bench on the river bank.&quot; Before Trudaine could answer, he had taken Rose&#x27;s cloak and hood from one of his assistants, and was helping her on with it. Danville, still pale and trembling, advanced a step when he saw these preparations for departure, and addressed a word or two to his wife; but he spoke in low tones, and the fast-advancing march of feet and sullen low roar of singing outside drowned his voice. An oath burst from his lips, and he struck his fist, in impotent fury, on a table near him. &quot;The seals are set on everything in this room and in the bedroom,&quot; said Magloire, approaching Lomaque, who nodded and signed to him to bring up the other police agents at the door. &quot;Ready,&quot; cried Magloire, coming forward immediately with his men, and raising his voice to make himself heard. &quot;Where to?&quot; Robespierre and his Hard-hitters were passing the house. The smoke of the torch-light was rolling in at the window; the tramping footsteps struck heavier and heavier on the ground; the low sullen roar of the Marseillaise was swelling to its loudest, as Lomaque referred for a moment to his arrest-order, and then answered: &quot;To the prison of St. Lazare!&quot; CHAPTER III. THE head jailer of St. Lazare stood in the outer hall of the prison, two days after the arrest at Trudaine&#x27;s lodgings, smoking his morning pipe. Looking toward the courtyard gate, he saw the wicket opened, and a privileged man let in, whom he soon recognized as the chief agent of the second section of Secret Police. &quot;Why, friend Lomaque,&quot; cried the jailer, a dvancing toward the courtyard, &quot;what brings you here this morning, business or pleasure?&quot; &quot;Pleasure, this time, citizen. I have an idle hour or two to spare for a walk. I find myself passing the prison, and I can&#x27;t resist calling in to see how my friend the head jailer is getting on.&quot; Lomaque spoke in a surprisingly brisk and airy manner. His eyes were suffering under a violent fit of weakness and winking; but he smiled, notwithstanding, with an air of the most inveterate cheerfulness. Those old enemies of his, who always distrusted him most when his eyes were most affected, would have certainly disbelieved every word of the friendly speech he had just made, and would have assumed it as a matter of fact that his visit to the head jailer had some specially underhand business at the bottom of it. &quot;How am I getting on?&quot; said the jailer, shaking his head. &quot;Overworked, friend--overworked. No idle hours in our department. Even the guilotine is getting too slow for us!&quot; &quot;Sent off your batch of prisoners for trial this morning?&quot; asked Lomaque, with an appearance of perfect unconcern. &quot;No; they&#x27;re just going,&quot; answered the other. &quot;Come and have a look at them.&quot; He spoke as if the prisoners were a collection of pictures on view, or a set of dresses just made up. Lomaque nodded his head, still with his air of happy, holiday carelessness. The jailer led the way to an inner hall; and, pointing lazily with his pipe-stem, said: &quot;Our morning batch, citizen, just ready for the baking.&quot; In one comer of the hall were huddled together more than thirty men and women of all ranks and ages; some staring round them with looks of blank despair; some laughing and gossiping recklessly. Near them lounged a guard of &quot;Patriots,&quot; smoking, spitting, and swearing. Between the patriots and the prisoners sat, on a rickety stool, the second jailer--a humpbacked man, with an immense red mustache--finishing his breakfast of broad beans, which he scooped out of a basin with his knife, and washed down with copious draughts of wine from a bottle. Carelessly as Lomaque looked at the shocking scene before him, his quick eyes contrived to take note of every prisoner&#x27;s face, and to descry in a few minutes Trudaine and his sister standing together at the back of the group. &quot;Now then, Apollo!&quot; cried the head jailer, addressing his subordinate by a facetious prison nickname, &quot;don&#x27;t be all day starting that trumpery batch of yours. And harkye, friend, I have leave of absence, on business, at my Section this afternoon. So it will be your duty to read the list for the guillotine, and chalk the prisoners&#x27; doors before the cart comes to-morrow morning. &#x27;Ware the bottle, Apollo, to-day; &#x27;ware the bottle, for fear of accidents with the death-list tomorrow.&quot; &quot;Thirsty July weather, this--eh, citizen?&quot; said Lomaque, leaving the head jailer, and patting the hunchback in the friendliest manner on the shoulder. &quot;Why, how you have got your batch huddled up together this morning! Shall I help you to shove them into marching order? My time is quite at your disposal. This is a holiday morning with me!&quot; &quot;Ha, ha, ha! what a jolly dog he is on his holiday morning!&quot; exclaimed the head jailer, as Lomaque--apparently taking leave of his natural character altogether in the exhilaration of an hour&#x27;s unexpected leisure--began pushing and pulling the prisoners into rank, with humorous mock apologies, at which not the officials only, but many of the victims themselves--reckless victims of a reckless tyranny--laughed heartily. Persevering to the last in his practical jest, Lomaque contrived to get close to Trudaine for a minute, and to give him one significant look before he seized him by the shoulders, like the rest. Now, then, rear-guard,&quot; cried Lomaque, pushing Trudaine on, &quot;close the line of march, and mind you keep step with your young woman there. Pluck up your spirits, citoyenne! one gets used to everything in this world, even to the guillotine!&quot; While he was speaking and pushing at the same time, Trudaine felt a piece of paper slip quickly between his neck and his cravat. &quot;Courage!&quot; he whispered, pressing his sister&#x27;s hand, as he saw her shuddering under the assumed brutality of Lomaque&#x27;s joke. Surrounded by the guard of &quot;Patriots,&quot; the procession of prisoners moved slowly into the outer courtyard, on its way to the revolutionary tribunal, the humpbacked jailer bringing up the rear. Lomaque was about to follow at some little distance, but the head jailer hospitably expostulated. &quot;What a hurry you&#x27;re in!&quot; said he. &quot;Now that incorrigible drinker, my second in command, has gone off with his batch, I don&#x27;t mind asking you to step in and have a drop of wine.&quot; &quot;Thank you,&quot; answered Lomaque; &quot;but I have rather a fancy for hearing the trial this morning. Suppose I come back afterward? What time do you go to your Section? At two o&#x27;clock, eh? Good! I shall try if I can&#x27;t get here soon after one.&quot; With these words he nodded and went out. The brilliant sunlight in the courtyard made him wink faster than ever. Had any of his old enemies been with him, they would have whispered within themselves, &quot;If you mean to come back at all, Citizen Lomaque, it will not be soon after one!&quot; On his way through the streets, the chief agent met one or two police office friends, who delayed his progress; so that when he arrived at the revolutionary tribunal the trials of the day were just about to begin. The principal article of furniture in the Hall of Justice was a long, clumsy, deal table, covered with green baize. At the head of this table sat the president and his court, with their hats on, backed by a heterogeneous collection of patriots officially connected in various ways with the proceedings that were to take place. Below the front of the table, a railed-off space, with a gallery beyond, was appropriated to the general public--mostly represented, as to the gallery, on this occasion, by women, all sitting together on forms, knitting, shirt-mending, and baby-linen-making, as coolly as if they were at home. Parallel with the side of the table furthest from the great door of entrance was a low platform railed off, on which the prisoners, surrounded by their guard, were now assembled to await their trial. The sun shone in brightly from a high window, and a hum of ceaseless talking pervaded the hall cheerfully as Lomaque entered it. He was a privileged man here, as at the prison; and he made his way in by a private door, so as to pass to the prisoners&#x27; platform, and to walk round it, before he got to a place behind the president&#x27;s chair. Trudaine, standing with his sister on the outermost limits of the group, nodded significantly as Lomaque looked up at him for an instant. He had contrived, on his way to the tribunal, to get an opportunity of reading the paper which the chief agent had slipped into his cravat. It contained these lines: &quot;I have just discovered who the citizen and citoyenne Dubois are. There is no chance for you but to confess everything. By that means you may inculpate a certain citizen holding authority, and may make it his interest, if he loves his own life, to save yours and your sister&#x27;s.&quot; Arrived at the back of the president&#x27;s chair, Lomaque recognized his two trusty subordinates, Magloire and Picard, waiting among the assembled patriot officials, to give their evidence. Beyond them, leaning against the wall, addressed by no one, and speaking to no one, stood the superintendent, Danville. Doubt and suspense were written in every line of his face; the fretfulness of an uneasy mind expressed itself in his slightest gesture--even in his manner of passing a handkerchief from time to time over his face, on which the perspiration was gathering thick and fast already. &quot;Silence!&quot; cried the usher of the court for the time being--a hoarse-voiced man in top-boots with a huge saber buckled to his side, and a bludgeon in his hand. &quot;Silence for the Citizen President!&quot; he reiterated, striking his bludgeon on the table. The president rose and proclaimed that the sitting for the day had begun; then sat down again. The momentary silence which followed was interrupted by a sudden confusion  among the prisoners on  the platform. Two of the guards sprang in among them. There was the thump of a heavy fall--a scream of terror from some of the female prisoners--then another dead silence, broken by one of the guards, who walked across the hall with a bloody knife in his hand, and laid it on the table. &quot;Citizen President,&quot; he said, &quot;I have to report that one of the prisoners has just stabbed himself.&quot; There was a murmuring exclamation, &quot;Is that all?&quot; among the women spectators, as they resumed their work. Suicide at the bar of justice was no uncommon occurrence, under the Reign of Terror. &quot;Name?&quot; asked the president, quietly taking up his pen and opening a book. &quot;Martigne,&quot; answered the humpbacked jailer, coming forward to the table. &quot;Description?&quot; &quot;Ex-royalist coach-maker to the tyrant Capet.&quot; &quot;Accusation?&quot; &quot;Conspiracy in prison.&quot; The president nodded, and entered in the book: &quot;Martigne, coachmaker. Accused of conspiring in prison. Anticipated course of law by suicide. Action accepted as sufficient confession of guilt. Goods confiscated. 1st Thermidor, year two of the Republic.&quot; &quot;Silence!&quot; cried the man with the bludgeon, as the president dropped a little sand on the entry, and signing to the jailer that he might remove the dead body, closed the book. &quot;Any special cases this morning?&quot; resumed the president, looking round at the group behind him. &quot;There is one,&quot; said Lomaque, making his way to the back of the official chair. &quot;Will it be convenient to you, citizen, to take the case of Louis Trudaine and Rose Danville first? Two of my men are detained here as witnesses, and their time is valuable to the Republic.&quot; The president marked a list of names before him, and handed it to the crier or usher, placing the figures one and two against Louis Trudaine and Rose Danville. While Lomaque was backing again to his former place behind the chair, Danville approached and whispered to him, &quot;There is a rumor that secret information has reached you about the citizen and citoyenne Dubois. Is it true? Do you know who they are?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Lomaque; &quot;but I have superior orders to keep the information to myself just at present.&quot; The eagerness with which Danville put his question, and the disappointment he showed on getting no satisfactory answer to it, were of a nature to satisfy the observant chief agent that his superintendent was really as ignorant as he appeared to be on the subject of the man and woman Dubois. That one mystery, at any rate was still, for Danville, a mystery unrevealed. &quot;Louis Trudaine! Rose Danville!&quot; shouted the crier, with another rap of his bludgeon. The two came forward, at the appeal, to the front railing of the platform. The first sight of her judges, the first shock on confronting the pitiless curiosity of the audience, seemed to overwhelm Rose. She turned from deadly pale to crimson, then to pale again, and hid her face on her brother&#x27;s shoulder. How fast she heard his heart throbbing! How the tears filled her eyes as she felt that his fear was all for her! &quot;Now,&quot; said the president, writing down their names. &quot;Denounced by whom?&quot; Magloire and Picard stepped forward to the table. The first answered--&quot;By Citizen Superintendent Danville.&quot; The reply made a great stir and sensation among both prisoners and audience. &quot;Accused of what?&quot; pursued the president. &quot;The male prisoner, of conspiracy against the Republic; the female prisoner, of criminal knowledge of the same.&quot; &quot;Produce your proofs in answer to this order.&quot; Picard and Magloire opened their minutes of evidence, and read to the president the same particulars which they had formerly read to Lomaque in the secret police office. &quot;Good,&quot; said the president, when they had done, &quot;we need trouble ourselves with nothing more than the identifying of the citizen and citoyenne Dubois, which, of course, you are prepared for. Have you heard the evidence?&quot; he continued, turning to the prisoners; while Picard and Magloire consulted together in whispers, looking perplexedly toward the chief agent, who stood silent behind them. &quot;Have you heard the evidence, prisoners? Do you wish to say anything? If you do, remember that the time of this tribunal is precious, and that you will not be suffered to waste it.&quot; &quot;I demand permission to speak for myself and for my sister,&quot; answered Trudaine. &quot;My object is to save the time of the tribunal by making a confession.&quot; The faint whispering, audible among the women spectators a moment before, ceased instantaneously as he pronounced the word confession. In the breathless silence, his low, quiet tones penetrated to the remotest corners of the hall; while, suppressing externally all evidences of the death-agony of hope within him, he continued his address in these words: &quot;I confess my secret visits to the house in the Rue de Clery. I confess that the persons whom I went to see are the persons pointed at in the evidence. And, lastly, I confess that my object in communicating with them as I did was to supply them with the means of leaving France. If I had acted from political motives to the political prejudice of the existing government, I admit that I should be guilty of that conspiracy against the Republic with which I am charged. But no political purpose animated, no political necessity urged me, in performing the action which has brought me to the bar of this tribunal. The persons whom I aided in leaving France were without political influence or political connections. I acted solely from private motives of humanity toward them and toward others--motives which a good republican may feel, and yet not turn traitor to the welfare of his country.&quot; &quot;Are you ready to inform the court, next, who the man and woman Dubois really are?&quot; inquired the president, impatiently. &quot;I am ready,&quot; answered Trudaine. &quot;But first I desire to say one word in reference to my sister, charged here at the bar with me.&quot; His voice grew less steady, and, for the first time, his color began to change, as Rose lifted her face from his shoulder and looked up at him eagerly. I implore the tribunal to consider my sister as innocent of all active participation in what is charged against me as a crime--&quot; He went on. &quot;Having spoken with candor about myself, I have some claim to be believed when I speak of her; when I assert that she neither did help me nor could help me. If there be blame, it is mine only; if punishment, it is I alone who should suffer.&quot; He stopped suddenly, and grew confused. It was easy to guard himself from the peril of looking at Rose, but he could not escape the hard trial to his self-possession of hearing her, if she spoke. Just as he pronounced the last sentence, she raised her face again from his shoulder, and eagerly whispered to him: &quot;No, no, Louis! Not that sacrifice, after all the others--not that, though you should force me into speaking to them myself!&quot; She abruptly quitted her hold of him, and fronted the whole court in an instant. The railing in front of her shook with the quivering of her arms and hands as she held by it to support herself! Her hair lay tangled on her shoulders; her face had assumed a strange fixedness; her gentle blue eyes, so soft and tender at all other times, were lit up wildly. A low hum of murmured curiosity and admiration broke from the women of the audience. Some rose eagerly from the benches; others cried: &quot;Listen, listen! she is going to speak!&quot; She did speak. Silvery and pure the sweet voice, sweeter than ever in sadness, stole its way through the gross sounds--through the coarse humming and the hissing whispers. &quot;My lord the president,&quot; began the poor girl firmly. Her next words were drowned in a volley of hisses from the women. &quot;Ah! aristocrat, aristocrat! None of your accursed titles here!&quot; was their shrill cry at her. She fronted that cry, she fronted the fierce gestures which accompanied it, with the steady light still in her eyes, with the strange rigidity still fastened on her face. She would have spoken again through the uproar and execration, but her brother&#x27;s voice overpowered her. &quot;Citizen president,&quot; he cried, &quot;I have not concluded. I demand leave to complete my confession. I  implore the tribunal to  attach no importance to what my sister says. The trouble and terror of this day have shaken her intellects. She is not responsible for her words--I assert it solemnly, in the face of the whole court!&quot; The blood flew up into his white face as he made the asseveration. Even at that supreme moment the great heart of the man reproached him for yielding himself to a deception, though the motive of it was to save his sister&#x27;s life. &quot;Let her speak! let her speak!&quot; exclaimed the women, as Rose, without moving, without looking at her brother, without seeming even to have heard what he said, made a second attempt to address her judges, in spite of Trudaine&#x27;s interposition. &quot;Silence!&quot; shouted the man with the bludgeon. &quot;Silence, you women! the citizen president is going to speak.&quot; &quot;The prisoner Trudaine has the ear of the court,&quot; said the president, &quot;and may continue his confession. If the female prisoner wishes to speak, she may be heard afterward. I enjoin both the accused persons to make short work of it with their addresses to me, or they will make their case worse instead of better. I command silence among the audience, and if I am not obeyed, I will clear the hall. Now, prisoner Trudaine, I invite you to proceed. No more about your sister; let her speak for herself. Your business and ours is with the man and woman Dubois. Are you, or are you not, ready to tell the court who they are?&quot; &quot;I repeat that I am ready,&quot; answered Trudaine. &quot;The citizen Dubois is a servant. The woman Dubois is the mother of the man who denounces me--Superintendent Danville.&quot; A low, murmuring, rushing sound of hundreds of exclaiming voices, all speaking, half-suppressedly, at the same moment, followed the delivery of the answer. No officer of the court attempted to control the outburst of astonishment. The infection of it spread to the persons on the platform, to the crier himself, to the judges of the tribunal, lounging, but the moment before, so carelessly silent in their chairs. When the noise was at length quelled, it was subdued in the most instantaneous manner by one man, who shouted from the throng behind the president&#x27;s chair: &quot;Clear the way there! Superintendent Danville is taken ill!&quot; A vehement whispering and contending of many voices interrupting each other, followed; then a swaying among the assembly of official people; then a great stillness; then the sudden appearance of Danville, alone, at the table. The look of him, as he turned his ghastly face toward the audience, silenced and steadied them in an instant, just as they were on the point of falling into fresh confusion. Every one stretched forward eagerly to hear what he would say. His lips moved; but the few words that fell from them were inaudible, except to the persons who happened to be close by him. Having spoken, he left the table supported by a police agent, who was seen to lead him toward the private door of the court, and, consequently, also toward the prisoners&#x27; platform. He stopped, however, halfway, quickly turned his face from the prisoners, and pointing toward the public door at the opposite side of the hall, caused himself to be led out into the air by that direction. When he had gone the president, addressing himself partly to Trudaine and partly to the audience, said: &quot;The Citizen Superintendent Danville has been overcome by the heat in the court. He has retired by my desire, under the care of a police agent, to recover in the open air; pledging himself to me to come back and throw a new light on the extraordinary and suspicious statement which the prisoner has just made. Until the return of Citizen Danville, I order the accused, Trudaine, to suspend any further acknowledgment of complicity which he may have to address to me. This matter must be cleared up before other matters are entered on. Meanwhile, in order that the time of the tribunal may not be wasted, I authorize the female prisoner to take this opportunity of making any statement concerning herself which she may wish to address to the judges.&quot; &quot;Silence him!&quot; &quot;Remove him out of court!&quot; &quot;Gag him!&quot; &quot;Guillotine him!&quot; These cries rose from the audience the moment the president had done speaking. They were all directed at Trudaine, who had made a last desperate effort to persuade his sister to keep silence, and had been detected in the attempt by the spectators. &quot;If the prisoner speaks another word to his sister, remove him,&quot; said the president, addressing the guard round the platform. &quot;Good! we shall hear her at last. Silence! silence!&quot; exclaimed the women, settling themselves comfortably on their benches, and preparing to resume their work. &quot;Rose Danville, the court is waiting to hear you,&quot; said the president, crossing his legs and leaning back luxuriously in his large armchair. Amid all the noise and confusion of the last few minutes, Rose had stood ever in the same attitude, with that strangely fixed expression never altering on her face but once. When her husband made his way to the side of the table and stood there prominently alone, her lips trembled a little, and a faint shade of color passed swiftly over her cheeks. Even that slight change had vanished now--she was paler, stiller, more widely altered from her former self than ever, as she faced the president and said these words: &quot;I wish to follow my brother&#x27;s example and make my confession, as he has made his. I would rather he had spoken for me; but he is too generous to say any words except such as he thinks may save me from sharing his punishment. I refuse to be saved, unless he is saved with me. Where he goes when he leaves this place, I will go; what he suffers, I will suffer; if he is to die, I believe God will grant me the strength to die resignedly with him!&quot; She paused for a moment, and half turned toward Trudaine--then checked herself instantly and went on: &quot;This is what I now wish to say, as to my share in the offense charged against my brother. Some time ago, he told me one day that he had seen my husband&#x27;s mother in Paris, disguised as a poor woman; that he had spoken to her, and forced her to acknowledge herself. Up to this time we had all felt certain that she had left France, because she held old-fashioned opinions which it is dangerous for people to hold now--had left France before we came to Paris. She told my brother that she had indeed gone (with an old, tried servant of the family to help and protect her) as far as Marseilles; and that, finding unforeseen difficulty there in getting further, she had taken it as a warning from Providence not to desert her son, of whom she was very passionately fond, and from whom she had been most unwilling to depart. Instead of waiting in exile for quieter times, she determined to go and hide herself in Paris, knowing her son was going there too. She assumed the name of her old and faithful servant, who declined to the last to leave her unprotected; and she proposed to live in the strictest secrecy and retirement, watching, unknown, the career of her son, and ready at a moment&#x27;s notice to disclose herself to him, when the settlement of pubic affairs might reunite her safely to her beloved child. My brother thought this plan full of danger, both for herself, for her son, and for the honest old man who was risking his head for his mistress&#x27;s sake. I thought so too; and in an evil hour I said to Louis: &#x27;Will you try in secret to get my husband&#x27;s mother away, and see that her faithful servant makes her really leave France this time?&#x27; I wrongly asked my brother to do this for a selfish reason of my own--a reason connected with my married life, which has not been a happy one. I had not succeeded in gaining my husband&#x27;s affection, and was not treated kindly by him. My brother--who has always loved me far more dearly, I am afraid, than I have ever deserved--my brother increased his kindness to me, seeing me treated unkindly by my husband. This made ill-blood between them. My thought, when I asked my brother to do for me what I have said, was, that if we two in secret saved my husband&#x27;s mother, without danger to him, from imperiling herself and her son, we should, when the time came for speaking of what we ha d done, appear to my husband in a new and better light. I should have shown how well I deserved his love, and Louis would have shown how well he deserved his brother-in-law&#x27;s gratitude; and so we should have made home happy at last, and all three have lived together affectionately. This was my thought; and when I told it to my brother, and asked him if there would be much risk, out of his kindness and indulgence toward me, he said &#x27;No.&#x27; He had so used me to accept sacrifices for my happiness that I let him endanger himself to help me in my little household plan. I repent this bitterly now; I ask his pardon with my whole heart. If he is acquitted, I will try to show myself worthier of his love. If he is found guilty, I, too, will go to the scaffold, and die with my brother, who risked his life for my sake.&quot; She ceased as quietly as she had begun, and turned once more to her brother. As she looked away from the court and looked at him, a few tears came into her eyes, and something of the old softness of form and gentleness of expression seemed to return to her face. He let her take his hand, but he seemed purposely to avoid meeting the anxious gaze she fixed on him. His head sunk on his breast; he drew his breath heavily, his countenance darkened and grew distorted, as if he were suffering some sharp pang of physical pain. He bent down a little, and, leaning his elbow on the rail before him, covered his face with his hand; and so quelled the rising agony, so forced back the scalding tears to his heart. The audience had heard Rose in silence, and they preserved the same tranquillity when she had done. This was a rare tribute to a prisoner from the people of the Reign of Terror. The president looked round at his colleagues, and shook his head suspiciously. &quot;This statement of the female prisoner&#x27;s complicates the matter very seriously,&quot; said he. &quot;Is there anybody in court,&quot; he added, looking at the persons behind his chair, &quot;who knows where the mother of Superintendent Danville and the servant are now?&quot; Lomaque came forward at the appeal, and placed himself by the table. &quot;Why, citizen agent!&quot; continued the president, looking hard at him, &quot;are you overcome by the heat, too?&quot; &quot;The fit seemed to take him, citizen president, when the female prisoner had made an end of her statement,&quot; exclaimed Magloire, pressing forward officiously. Lomaque gave his subordinate a look which sent the man back directly to the shelter of the official group; then said, in lower tones than were customary with him: &quot;I have received information relative to the mother of Superintendent Danville and the servant, and am ready to answer any questions that may be put to me.&quot; &quot;Where are they now?&quot; asked the president. &quot;She and the servant are known to have crossed the frontier, and are supposed to be on their way to Cologne. But, since they have entered Germany, their whereabouts is necessarily a matter of uncertainty to the republican authorities.&quot; &quot;Have you any information relative to the conduct of the old servant while he was in Paris?&quot; &quot;I have information enough to prove that he was not an object for political suspicion. He seems to have been simply animated by servile zeal for the woman&#x27;s interests; to have performed for her all the menial offices of a servant in private; and to have misled the neighbors by affected equality with her in public.&quot; &quot;Have you any reason to believe that Superintendent Danville was privy to his mother&#x27;s first attempt at escaping from France?&quot; &quot;I infer it from what the female prisoner has said, and for other reasons which it would be irregular to detail before the tribunal. The proofs can no doubt be obtained if I am allowed time to communicate with the authorities at Lyons and Marseilles.&quot; At this moment Danville re-entered the court; and, advancing to the table, placed himself close by the chief agent&#x27;s side. They looked each other steadily in the face for an instant. &quot;He has recovered from the shock of Trudaine&#x27;s answer,&quot; thought Lomaque, retiring. &quot;His hand trembles, his face is pale, but I can see regained self-possession in his eye, and I dread the consequences already.&quot; &quot;Citizen president,&quot; began Danville, &quot;I demand to know if anything has transpired affecting my honor and patriotism in my absence?&quot; He spoke apparently with the most perfect calmness, but he looked nobody in the face. His eyes were fixed steadily on the green baize of the table beneath him. &quot;The female prisoner has made a statement, referring principally to herself and her brother,&quot; answered the president, &quot;but incidentally mentioning a previous attempt on your mother&#x27;s part to break existing laws by emigrating from France. This portion of the confession contains in it some elements of suspicion which seriously affect you--&quot; &quot;They shall be suspicions no longer--at my own peril I will change them to certainties!&quot; exclaimed Danville, extending his arm theatrically, and looking up for the first time. &quot;Citizen president, I avow it with the fearless frankness of a good patriot; I was privy to my mother&#x27;s first attempt at escaping from France.&quot; Hisses and cries of execration followed this confession. He winced under them at first; but recovered his self-possession before silence was restored. &quot;Citizens, you have heard the confession of my fault,&quot; he resumed, turning with desperate assurance toward the audience; &quot;now hear the atonement I have made for it at the altar of my country.&quot; He waited at the end of that sentence, until the secretary to the tribunal had done writing it down in the report book of the court. &quot;Transcribe faithfully to the letter!&quot; cried Danville, pointing solemnly to the open page of the volume. &quot;Life and death hang on my words.&quot; The secretary took a fresh dip of ink, and nodded to show that he was ready. Danville went on: &quot;In these times of glory and trial for France,&quot; he proceeded, pitching his voice to a tone of deep emotion, &quot;what are all good citizens most sacredly bound to do? To immolate their dearest private affections and interests before their public duties! On the first attempt of my mother to violate the laws against emigration, by escaping from France, I failed in making the heroic sacrifice which inexorable patriotism demanded of me. My situation was more terrible than the situation of Brutus sitting in judgment on his own sons. I had not the Roman fortitude to rise equal to it. I erred, citizens--erred as Coriolanus did, when his august mother pleaded with him for the safety of Rome! For that error I deserved to he purged out of the republican community; but I escaped my merited punishment--nay, I even rose to the honor of holding an office under the Government. Time passed; and again my mother attempted an escape from France. Again, inevitable fate brought my civic virtue to the test. How did I meet this second supremest trial? By an atonement for past weakness, terrible as the trial itself. Citizens, you will shudder; but you will applaud while you tremble. Citizens, look! and while you look, remember well the evidence given at the opening of this case. Yonder stands the enemy of his country, who intrigued to help my mother to escape; here stands the patriot son, whose voice was the first, the only voice, to denounce him for the crime!&quot; As he spoke, he pointed to Trudaine, then struck himself on the breast, then folded his arms, and looked sternly at the benches occupied by the spectators. &quot;Do you assert,&quot; exclaimed the president, &quot;that at the time when you denounced Trudaine, you knew him to be intriguing to aid your mother&#x27;s escape?&quot; &quot;I assert it,&quot; answered Danville. The pen which the president held dropped from his hand at that reply; his colleagues started, and looked at each other in blank silence. A murmur of &quot;Monster! monster!&quot; began with the prisoners on the platform, and spread instantly to the audience, who echoed and echoed it again; the fiercest woman-republican on the benches joined cause at last with the haughtiest woman-aristocrat on the platform. Even in that sphere of direst discords, in that age of sharpest enmities, the one touch of Nature preserved its old eternal  virtue, and roused the mo ther-instinct which makes the whole world kin. Of the few persons in the court who at once foresaw the effect of Danville&#x27;s answer on the proceedings of the tribunal, Lomaque was one. His sallow face whitened as he looked toward the prisoners&#x27; platform. &quot;They are lost,&quot; he murmured to himself, moving out of the group in which he had hitherto stood. &quot;Lost! The lie which has saved that villain&#x27;s head leaves them without the shadow of a hope. No need to stop for the sentence--Danville&#x27;s infamous presence of mind has given them up to the guillotine!&quot; Pronouncing these words, he went out hurriedly by a door near the platform, which led to the prisoners&#x27; waiting-room. Rose&#x27;s head sank again on her brother&#x27;s shoulder. She shuddered, and leaned back faintly on the arm which he extended to support her. One of the female prisoners tried to help Trudaine in speaking consolingly to her; but the consummation of her husband&#x27;s perfidy seemed to have paralyzed her at heart. She murmured once in her brother&#x27;s ear, &quot;Louis! I am resigned to die--nothing but death is left for me after the degradation of having loved that man.&quot; She said those words and closed her eyes wearily, and spoke no more. &quot;One other question, and you may retire,&quot; resumed the president, addressing Danville. &quot;Were you cognizant of your wife&#x27;s connection with her brother&#x27;s conspiracy?&quot; Danville reflected for a moment, remembered that there were witnesses in court who could speak to his language and behavior on the evening of his wife&#x27;s arrest, and resolved this time to tell the truth. &quot;I was not aware of it,&quot; he answered. &quot;Testimony in my favor can be called which will prove that when my wife&#x27;s complicity was discovered I was absent from Paris.&quot; Heartlessly self-possessed as he was, the public reception of his last reply had shaken his nerve. He now spoke in low tones, turning his back on the spectators, and fixing his eyes again on the green baize of the table at which he stood. &quot;Prisoners, have you any objection to make, any evidence to call, invalidating the statement by which Citizen Danville has cleared himself of suspicion?&quot; inquired the president. &quot;He has cleared himself by the most execrable of all falsehoods,&quot; answered Trudaine. &quot;If his mother could be traced and brought here, her testimony would prove it.&quot; &quot;Can you produce any other evidence in support of your allegation?&quot; asked the president &quot;I cannot.&quot; &quot;Citizen Superintendent Danville, you are at liberty to retire. Your statement will be laid before the authority to whom you are officially responsible. Either you merit a civic crown for more than Roman virtue, or--&quot; Having got thus far, the president stopped abruptly, as if unwilling to commit himself too soon to an opinion, and merely repeated, &quot;You may retire.&quot; Danville left the court immediately, going out again by the public door. He was followed by murmurs from the women&#x27;s benches, which soon ceased, however, when the president was observed to close his note-book, and turn round toward his colleagues. &quot;The sentence!&quot; was the general whisper now. &quot;Hush, hush--the sentence!&quot; After a consultation of a few minutes with the persons behind him, the president rose, and spoke the momentous words: &quot;Louis Trudaine and Rose Danville, the revolutionary tribunal, having heard the charge against you, and having weighed the value of what you have said in answer to it, decides that you are both guilty, and condemns you to the penalty of death.&quot; Having delivered the sentence in those terms, he sat down again, and placed a mark against the two first condemned names on the list of prisoners. Immediately afterward the next case was called on, and the curiosity of the audience was stimulated by a new trial. CHAPTER IV. THE waiting-room of the revolutionary tribunal was a grim, bare place, with a dirty stone floor, and benches running round the walls. The windows  were high and barred; and at the outer door, leading into the street, two sentinels kept watch. On entering this comfortless retreat from the court, Lomaque found it perfectly empty. Solitude was just then welcome to him. He remained in the waiting-room, walking slowly from end to end over the filthy pavement, talking eagerly and incessantly to himself. After a while, the door communicating with the tribunal opened, and the humpbacked jailer made his appearance, leading in Trudaine and Rose. &quot;You will have to wait here,&quot; said the little man, &quot;till the rest of them have been tried and sentenced; and then you will all go back to prison in a lump. Ha, citizen,&quot; he continued, observing Lomaque at the other end of the hall, and bustling up to him. &quot;Here still, eh? If you were going to stop much longer, I should ask a favor of you.&quot; &quot;I am in no hurry,&quot; said Lomaque, with a glance at the two prisoners. &quot;Good!&quot; cried the humpback, drawing his hand across his mouth; &quot;I am parched with thirst, and dying to moisten my throat at the wine-shop over the way. Just mind that man and woman while I&#x27;m gone, will you? It&#x27;s the merest form--there&#x27;s a guard outside, the windows are barred, the tribunal is within hail. Do you mind obliging me?&quot; &quot;On the contrary, I am glad of the opportunity.&quot; &quot;That&#x27;s a good fellow--and, remember, if I am asked for, you must say I was obliged to quit the court for a few minutes, and left you in charge.&quot; With these words, the humpbacked jailer ran off to the wineshop. He had scarcely disappeared before Trudaine crossed the room, and caught Lomaque by the arm. &quot;Save her,&quot; he whispered; &quot;there is an opportunity--save her!&quot; His face was flushed--his eyes wandered--his breath on the chief agent&#x27;s cheek, while he spoke, felt scorching hot. &quot;Save her!&quot; he repeated, shaking Lomaque by the arm, and dragging him toward the door. &quot;Remember all you owe to my father--remember our talk on that bench by the river--remember what you said to me yourself on the night of the arrest--don&#x27;t wait to think--save her, and leave me without a word! If I die alone, I can die as a man should; if she goes to the scaffold by my side, my heart will fail me--I shall die the death of a coward! I have lived for her life--let me die for it, and I die happy!&quot; He tried to say more, but the violence of his agitation forbade it. He could only shake the arm he held again and again, and point to the bench on which Rose sat--her head sunk on her bosom, her hands crossed listlessly on her lap. &quot;There are two armed sentinels outside--the windows are barred--you are without weapons--and even if you had them, there is a guard-house within hail on one side of you, and the tribunal on the other. Escape from this room is impossible,&quot; answered Lomaque. &quot;Impossible!&quot; repeated the other, furiously. &quot;You traitor! you coward! can you look at her sitting there helpless, her very life ebbing away already with every minute that passes, and tell me coolly that escape is impossible?&quot; In the frenzy of his grief and despair, he lifted his disengaged hand threateningly while he spoke. Lomaque caught him by the wrist, and drew him toward a window open at the top. &quot;You are not in your right senses,&quot; said the chief agent, firmly; &quot;anxiety and apprehension on your sister&#x27;s account have shaken your mind. Try to compose yourself, and listen to me. I have something important to say--&quot; (Trudaine looked at him incredulously.) &quot;Important,&quot; continued Lomaque, &quot;as affecting your sister&#x27;s interests at this terrible crisis.&quot; That last appeal had an instantaneous effect. Trudaine&#x27;s outstretched hand dropped to his side, and a sudden change passed over his expression. &quot;Give me a moment,&quot; he said, faintly; and turning away, leaned against the wall and pressed his burning forehead on the chill, damp stone. He did not raise his head again till he had mastered himself, and could say quietly, &quot;Speak; I am fit to hear you, and sufficiently in my senses to ask your forgiveness for what I said just now.&quot; &quot;When I left the tribunal and entered this room,&quot; Lomaque began in a whisper, &quot;there was no thought in my mind that could be turned to good account, either for your sister or for you. I was fit for nothing but to deplore the failure of the confession which I came to St. L azare to suggest to you as your best plan of defense. Since then, an idea has struck me, which may be useful--an idea so desperate, so uncertain--involving a proposal so absolutely dependent, as to its successful execution, on the merest chance, that I refuse to confide it to you except on one condition.&quot; &quot;Mention the condition! I submit to it before hand.&quot; &quot;Give me your word of honor that you will not mention what I am about to say to your sister until I grant you permission to speak. Promise me that when you see her shrinking before the terrors of death to-night, you will have self-restraint enough to abstain from breathing a word of hope to her. I ask this, because there are ten--twenty--fifty chances to one that there _is_ no hope.&quot; &quot;I have no choice but to promise,&quot; answered Trudaine. Lomaque produced his pocket-book and pencil before he spoke again. &quot;I will enter into particulars as soon as I have asked a strange question of you,&quot; he said. &quot;You have been a great experimenter in chemistry in your time--is your mind calm enough, at such a trying moment as this, to answer a question which is connected with chemistry in a very humble way? You seem astonished. Let me put the question at once. Is there any liquid or powder, or combination of more than one ingredient known, which will remove writing from paper, and leave no stain behind?&quot; &quot;Certainly! But is that all the question? Is there no greater difficulty?&quot; &quot;None. Write the prescription, whatever it may be, on that leaf,&quot; said the other, giving him the pocket-book. &quot;Write it down, with plain directions for use.&quot; Trudaine obeyed. &quot;This is the first step,&quot; continued Lomaque, putting the book in his pocket, &quot;toward the accomplishment of my purpose--my uncertain purpose, remember! Now, listen; I am going to put my own head in danger for the chance of saving yours and your sister&#x27;s by tampering with the death-list. Don&#x27;t interrupt me! If I can save one, I can save the other. Not a word about gratitude! Wait till you know the extent of your obligation. I tell you plainly, at the outset, there is a motive of despair, as well as a motive of pity, at the bottom of the action in which I am now about to engage. Silence! I insist on it. Our time is short; it is for me to speak, and for you to listen. The president of the tribunal has put the deathmark against your names on the prison list of today. That list, when the trials are over and it is marked to the end, will be called in this room before you are taken to St. Lazare. It will then be sent to Robespierre, who will keep it, having a copy made of it the moment it is delivered, for circulation among his colleagues--St. Just, and the rest. It is my business to make a duplicate of this copy in the first instance. The duplicate will be compared with the original, and possibly with the copy, too, either by Robespierre himself, or by some one in whom he can place implicit trust, and will then be sent to St. Lazare without passing through my hands again. It will be read in public the moment it is received, at the grating of the prison, and will afterward be kept by the jailer, who will refer to it, as he goes round in the evening with a piece of chalk, to mark the cell doors of the prisoners destined for the guillotine to-morrow. That duty happens, to-day, to fall to the hunchback whom you saw speaking to me. He is a confirmed drinker, and I mean to tempt him with such wine as he rarely tastes. If--after the reading of the list in public, and before the marking of the cell doors--I can get him to sit down to the bottle, I will answer for making him drunk, for getting the list out of his pocket, and for wiping your names out of it with the prescription you have just written for me. I shall write all the names, one under another, just irregularly enough in my duplicate to prevent the interval left by the erasure from being easily observed. If I succeed in this, your door will not be marked, and your names will not be called tomorrow morning when the tumbrils come for the guillotine. In the present confusion of prisoners pouring in every day for trial, and prisoners pouring out every day for execution, you will have the best possible chance of security against awkward inquiries, if you play your cards properly, for a good fortnight or ten days at least. In that time--&quot; &quot;Well! well!&quot; cried Trudaine, eagerly. Lomaque looked toward the tribunal door, and lowered his voice to a fainter whisper before he continued, &quot;In that time Robespierre&#x27;s own head may fall into the sack! France is beginning to sicken under the Reign of Terror. Frenchmen of the Moderate faction, who have lain hidden for months in cellars and lofts, are beginning to steal out and deliberate by twos and threes together, under cover of the night. Robespierre has not ventured for weeks past to face the Convention Committee. He only speaks among his own friends at the Jacobins. There are rumors of a terrible discovery made by Carnot, of a desperate resolution taken by Tallien. Men watching behind the scenes see that the last days of the Terror are at hand. If Robespierre is beaten in the approaching struggle, you are saved--for the new reign must be a Reign of Mercy. If he conquers, I have only put off the date of your death and your sister&#x27;s, and have laid my own neck under the axe. Those are your chances--this is all I can do.&quot; He paused, and Trudaine again endeavored to speak such words as might show that he was not unworthy of the deadly risk which Lomaque was prepared to encounter. But once more the chief agent peremptorily and irritably interposed: &quot;I tell you, for the third time,&quot; he said, &quot;I will listen to no expressions of gratitude from you till I know when I deserve them. It is true that I recollect your father&#x27;s timely kindness to me--true that I have not forgotten what passed, five years since at your house by the river-side. I remember everything, down to what you would consider the veriest trifle--that cup of coffee, for instance, which your sister kept hot for me. I told you then that you would think better of me some day. I know that you do now. But this is not all. You want to glorify me to my face for risking my life for you. I won&#x27;t hear you, because my risk is of the paltriest kind. I am weary of my life. I can&#x27;t look back to it with pleasure. I am too old to look forward to what is left of it with hope. There was something in that night at your house before the wedding--something in what you said, in what your sister did--which altered me. I have had my days of gloom and self-reproach, from time to time, since then. I have sickened at my slavery, and subjection, and duplicity, and cringing, first under one master then under another. I have longed to look back at my life, and comfort myself with the sight of some good action, just as a frugal man comforts himself with the sight of his little savings laid by in an old drawer. I can&#x27;t do this, and I want to do it. The want takes me like a fit, at uncertain intervals--suddenly, under the most incomprehensible influences. A glance up at the blue sky--starlight over the houses of this great city, when I look out at the night from my garret window--a child&#x27;s voice coming suddenly, I don&#x27;t know where from--the piping of my neighbor&#x27;s linnet in his little cage--now one trifling thing, now another--wakes up that want in me in a moment. Rascal as I am, those few simple words your sister spoke to the judge went through and through me like a knife. Strange, in a man like me, isn&#x27;t it? I am amazed at it myself. _My_ life? Bah! I&#x27;ve let it out for hire to be kicked about by rascals from one dirty place to another, like a football! It&#x27;s my whim to give it a last kick myself, and throw it away decently before it lodges on the dunghill forever. Your sister kept a good cup of coffee hot for me, and I give her a bad life in return for the compliment. You want to thank me for it? What folly! Thank me when I have done something useful. Don&#x27;t thank me for that!&quot;</div></div></div><div class="loadMoreContainer_qxHk"><button class="loadMoreButton_K4lJ">See more</button></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer
